Add to that the fact that they did it all in concert and they'd all have received Oscars, save for the plot and the timing (year) of it's release, when combined with demagoguery toward the subject matter, the fact that HIV-AIDS was just at that moment popping into the news in a horrifying manner, meant that was impossible.Hope you didn't toss out that last VCR cuz they haven't had the good sense to release this in DVD yet.

That's a darNed well-written, tight script and superfine storytelling.It was somewhat later when I first saw the movie, and even then I was so young that I could hardly believe it was a generally mainstream movie.

493936,AP0DQSDFSLP4P,B000006GDD,"Christopher M. MacNeil ""Chris M""","[18, 19]","When released in 1982, director Arthur Hiller's ""Making Love"" was a bold venture for its time and critcally panned, probably more for its risky content than its acting or writing. Between her TV gigs as one of Charlie's angels and Mrs. King to a Scarecrow, veteran actress Kate Jackson said she would have offered to pay for the role of a driven TV executive married to a doctor, played by former ""Rookies"" co-star Michael Ontkean. But with wife Claire so tied up with her work, husband Zak begins to explore a long-denied curiosity about a same-sex encounter. He finds it in studly writer Harry Hamlin, then a new face on the acting horizon. With his same-sex curiosity answered and his desires and preference unleashed, Zak struggles with how to come clean with wife Kate, and the climactic scene in which he confesses his homosexuality is carried with appropriate emotional shock and devastation by both Jackson and Ontkean. By today's standards, the film may seem dated and irrelevant, but it was hardly so at the time. A good script is bolstered by good acting and singer Roberta Flack's haunting theme song that was a chart-buster in '82. Beyond the film's obvious topic, it also renders a subtle lesson in the need for honesty. Watch for a jewel of a supporting role from late British actress Wendy Hiller. She sparkles as neighbor to Claire and Zak, and hers is the voice of reason in the emotional upheaval of a marriage and its two souls headed for oblivion. With the film finally available on DVD, a second generation might watch and learn the need for honesty not only with self but with significant others. Now being touted as the ""Brokeback Mountain"" of its day, the comparison might be unintentionally unkind. ""Making Love,"" just as ""Brokeback ..."" does, is certainly strong enough in its own message to stand on its own merits.",4,A worthy early effort,1040169600,"12 18, 2002",2002,1843,"['When', 'released', '1982', 'director', 'Arthur', 'Hiller', 'Making', 'Love', 'was', 'bold', 'venture', 'time', 'critcally', 'panned', 'probably', 'more', 'risky', 'content', 'acting', 'writing', 'Between', 'TV', 'gigs', 'one', 'Charlie', 'angels', 'Mrs.', 'King', 'Scarecrow', 'veteran', 'actress', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'said', 'would', 'have', 'offered', 'pay', 'role', 'driven', 'TV', 'executive', 'married', 'doctor', 'played', 'former', 'Rookies', 'co-star', 'Michael', 'Ontkean', 'wife', 'Claire', 'so', 'tied', 'up', 'work', 'husband', 'Zak', 'explore', 'long-denied', 'curiosity', 'same-sex', 'encounter', 'studly', 'writer', 'Harry', 'Hamlin', 'then', 'new', 'face', 'acting', 'horizon', 'same-sex', 'curiosity', 'answered', 'desires', 'preference', 'unleashed', 'Zak', 'how', 'come', 'clean', 'wife', 'Kate', 'climactic', 'scene', 'homosexuality', 'carried', 'appropriate', 'emotional', 'shock', 'devastation', 'Jackson', 'Ontkean', 'today', 'standards', 'film', 'may', 'seem', 'dated', 'irrelevant', 'was', 'hardly', 'so', 'time', 'good', 'script', 'bolstered', 'good', 'acting', 'singer', 'Roberta', 'Flack', 'haunting', 'theme', 'song', 'was', 'chart-buster', ""'82"", 'film', 'obvious', 'topic', 'also', 'subtle', 'lesson', 'need', 'honesty', 'Watch', 'jewel', 'supporting', 'role', 'late', 'British', 'actress', 'Wendy', 'Hiller', 'as', 'neighbor', 'Claire', 'Zak', 'hers', 'voice', 'reason', 'emotional', 'upheaval', 'marriage', 'two', 'souls', 'headed', 'oblivion', 'film', 'finally', 'available', 'DVD', 'second', 'generation', 'might', 'watch', 'learn', 'need', 'honesty', 'not', 'only', 'self', 'significant', 'others', 'Now', 'being', 'touted', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'day', 'comparison', 'might', 'be', 'unintentionally', 'unkind', 'Making', 'Love', 'just', 'Brokeback', 'certainly', 'strong', 'enough', 'own', 'message', 'stand', 'own', 'merits']",N/A
493937,A3F8U4CRMDLY2T,B000006GDD,CHUCK WEST,"[14, 14]","Few films reach the level of quality found in &quot;MAKING LOVE.&quot; I first saw this film on cable about 1983 when I was about 16 years old. I really thought it was exceptional then, but, having recently viewed it again, I realize that I never picked up on the depth this film achieved by approaching the subject matter in such a simple, direct, and honest way. The beauty and heartache come from the fact that if an element of life that is unfamiliar to us enters our life, we all must simply accept what IS, what exists, the big picture, instead of trying to find a reason or to place blame. This film shows us that peace comes from knowing (and accepting both in our hearts and our minds) we have no control over OTHER human beings and that we don't CHOOSE who we are...we ARE who we are. Twenty years have brought clarity on these messages director Arthur Hiller wanted to send to the world, and did so with such skill.I still believe, as I have always believed and stated, that KATE JACKSON truly should have been nominated for (AND WON) the 1982 Academy Award for Best Actress. Unfortunately, MAKING LOVE was pushed back to an early 1982 release in theatres, and by the end of that year, the film and its performances were neglected in the Academy members' memories. Had the film been released before the end of 1981, I feel MAKING LOVE and KATE JACKSON would have still been fresh in the minds of the Academy voters, and at the very least KATE JACKSON would have walked away with a truly-deserved Oscar.MAKING LOVE is the story of a happily-married heterosexual couple whose relationship evolves gradually and dramatically, as the husband begins to slowly realize and come to terms with his homosexuality. The dynamics of the situation are interesting to watch, in that the husband Zack (MICHAEL ONTKEAN) does not tell his wife, Claire (KATE JACKSON), because he does not want to hurt nor abandon her. A monkey-wrench is thrown into the situation, as Zack begins to fall romantically for a novelist, Bart (HARRY HAMLIN). Bart, because of past hurt, family dysfunction, and emotional baggage, can't give of himself emotionally enough for the perception Zack has of how their relationship should be. This frustrates and tortures Zack all the more until he begins to transfer his tension and frustration toward Claire. The story winds up less about sex or sexuality than about 3 individual human beings trying to find their way emotionally.1. CLAIRE must overcome her reactionary rage, sense of abandonment, unneccessary sense of guilt, and perception that Zack has simply lied and used her.2. BART must overcome his fear of intimacy, commitment, communication, and fear of being hurt.3. ZACK must overcome his fear of his true self, fear of the potential repercussions in his relationships by admitting the truth, and the fear of the change in dynamics in his life by moving on with his life, leaving himself exposed to new, unfamiliar territory.I swear it gets to me every time I watch the later-married CLAIRE introduce her son to ZACK as &quot;Rupert,&quot; the name they had planned to name the son they never had together. It's one of the most heartachingly tender and poignant moments film has ever given us (Get out the Kleenex!). One can just feel the pure love exuding from these two characters, former lovers, true caring friends...Sadly, though, this video has been out of print for several years. Hopefully, Fox Home Video will someday reissue and rebox MAKING LOVE on both VHS and DVD. PLEASE DO IT SOON, FOX. This film can help the psychological and spiritual wellness of so many people. It was SO ahead of it's time. PLEASE, DON'T LET IT FADE AWAY...",5,WHERE'S KATE JACKSON'S OSCAR?

493941,AGTWRSKJ0WEQT,B000006GDD,David J. Kucharski,"[107, 110]","When it was released in 1982, MAKING LOVE was publicized as the first film from a major Hollywood studio to take an honest look at homosexuality. Today, even in our more tolerant social climate, the movie remains just about the only film from a major Hollywood studio to take an honest look at homosexuality. MAKING LOVE is a compassionate, sensitive examination of one man coming to discover, and accept, that he is gay.Zack (Michael Ontkean) and Claire (Kate Jackson) are a young, attractive and successful married couple; he is a physician and she is a television producer. They have just bought a new home and talk about having a child. But Zack begins to question his sexual identity and to close himself off from his wife. Then he meets Bart (Harry Hamlin), a sexually adventurous gay man who forces Zack to come to terms with his sexual feelings.Although MAKING LOVE is nearly twenty years old, the only things dated about the movie are the clothing and hairstyles. There have certainly been other Hollywood movies that deal with homosexuality (PHILADELPHIA, IN AND OUT, etc.). But most of these movies seem oddly hesitant to address difficult issues or deflect them by using humor. By contrast, MAKING LOVE presents with complete honesty a man learning to accept that he is gay, along with all of the conflicted feelings and painful choices this involves.Barry Sandler's script is outstanding. It employs a device that today has become an annoying cliche: characters sharing their inner feelings by directly addressing the camera. But in this film, the device really works, thanks to honest writing and performances.All three lead actors are excellent, giving us portraits of believable, imperfect human beings who nonetheless try to do their best with the situation that confronts them. A special word of praise must go to Kate Jackson. Certainly Jackson's TV work (CHARLIE'S ANGELS, SCARECROW AND MRS. KING) never gave her the chance to play such an intelligent, fully-rounded character. Jackson is excellent and in a few scenes is so thoroughly convincing that she breaks your heart.Arthur Hiller's direction is understated and eloquent. And Leonard Rosenman's musical score is superb. His score helps us to recognize the movie for what it is: a tender and bittersweet love story. For example, early on there is a scene in which Zack has a painful meeting with a cancer patient and, distraught over his inability to help her, goes cruising for a sexual partner. Rosenman's musical score helps us to see that Zack's act is not cheap or sensational but instead is an attempt by a lonely, confused man to find emotional connection.A movie of exceptional quality, MAKING LOVE should be much better known.

Zack and Claire have been married for eight years, have just moved into their first house, and thankfully have no children--though Claire is becoming more and more eager to get going on that next stage in their life.  The problem is that Zack has been repressing his homosexual yearnings his whole life and now they will no longer stay hidden below the surface.  Zack's internal struggle with his &quot;demon&quot; is portrayed in such a realistic way that I could not help but feel for him.  We watch Zack fight to keep these yearnings buried, but they start coming out against his will--it is obvious that he has fought his true nature for too long and it will no longer be denied.  He looks with longing at a gay couple on a motorcycle next to him in traffic.  He starts going to the gay bar--where he seems very uncomfortable, but he goes there because he can't seem to help himself.  I find it absolutely amazing that he was able to keep his true feelings buried for the eight years that he was married.  It is after he meets Bart--played by Harry Hamlin--that his iron will finally breaks down and he makes a true physical and emotional connection with another man.One aspect of this movie that is really good is that both Claire and Bart talk directly to the camera about their feelings for or lack of feelings for and relationships with Zack.  Bart is the natural loner type that sort of falls for Zack--in that he does not just have a one night stand with Zack like he does all the other guys he meets--but he just cannot handle any kind of commitment or long term relationship-so he drives Zack away.  Claire is very much in love with her husband, and she has completely idealized her marriage by turning a blind eye to the problems that have been lurking below the surface of her marriage.I won't say how the movie ends, but it does end happily--which is very important for me because I hate unhappy endings.",5,A Very Well Done New Take on the Infamous Love Triangle,986256000,"04 3, 2001",2001,2018,"['script', 'well', 'written', 'acting', 'impeccable', 'plot', 'characters', 'are', 'believable', 'Zack', 'Claire', 'have', 'been', 'married', 'eight', 'years', 'have', 'just', 'moved', 'first', 'house', 'thankfully', 'have', 'children', 'Claire', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'eager', 'get', 'going', 'next', 'stage', 'life', 'problem', 'Zack', 'been', 'repressing', 'homosexual', 'yearnings', 'whole', 'life', 'now', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'stay', 'hidden', 'surface', 'Zack', 'internal', 'struggle', 'quot', 'quot', 'portrayed', 'such', 'realistic', 'way', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'watch', 'Zack', 'fight', 'keep', 'yearnings', 'buried', 'start', 'coming', 'out', 'will', 'obvious', 'fought', 'true', 'nature', 'too', 'long', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'denied', 'longing', 'gay', 'couple', 'motorcycle', 'next', 'traffic', 'going', 'gay', 'bar', 'where', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'help', 'find', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'was', 'able', 'keep', 'true', 'feelings', 'buried', 'eight', 'years', 'was', 'married', 'Bart', 'played', 'Harry', 'Hamlin', 'iron', 'will', 'finally', 'breaks', 'down', 'true', 'physical', 'emotional', 'connection', 'man.One', 'aspect', 'movie', 'really', 'good', 'Claire', 'Bart', 'talk', 'directly', 'camera', 'feelings', 'lack', 'feelings', 'relationships', 'Zack', 'Bart', 'natural', 'loner', 'type', 'sort', 'falls', 'Zack', 'not', 'just', 'have', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'Zack', 'other', 'guys', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'handle', 'kind', 'commitment', 'long', 'term', 'relationship-so', 'Zack', 'away', 'Claire', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'husband', 'completely', 'idealized', 'marriage', 'turning', 'blind', 'eye', 'problems', 'have', 'been', 'lurking', 'surface', 'marriage.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'how', 'movie', 'end', 'happily', 'very', 'important', 'hate', 'unhappy', 'endings']",N/A

493946,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000006GDD,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 22]","I have to admit there is a certain time-capsule fascination with seeing a mainstream Hollywood movie deal with the then-forbidden subject of unfulfilled gay love without the specter of AIDS. Unfortunately, this 1982 film is so emotionally self-contained and overly tasteful that the soap opera storyline has no chance to breathe with real life. Unsurprisingly, it was directed by Arthur Hiller, who made the similarly antiseptic ""Love Story"" a dozen years earlier. This time around, working from a script by openly gay screenwriter Barry Sandler from a story by biographer A. Scott Berg, Hiller maneuvers around a romantic triangle in which the idyllic marriage of upcoming TV executive Claire and successful doctor Zack is shattered by the sudden presence of Bart, a writer of the Fitzgerald school of emotional nihilism.The set-up is so calculated not to offend that it becomes offensive in its dishonesty, first in the external factors such as the couple's overly romanticized view of their life together and their homogenized existence and then in the hollow emotional responses that each character conveys once the illusions dissipate. The film tracks the marital disintegration and Zack's concurrent sexual awakening in excruciating detail, and the dialogue fortifies the by-the-numbers story with a condescending TV-movie tone, especially in the overly convenient use of talking-to-the-camera monologues. The acting doesn't help much, though I have to give credit to the three leads for having the courage to accept parts in a movie that must have been diagnosed with a pre-Brokeback sense of cinematic leprosy.Everyone is sincere but transparent with nary a hint of human complexity. Just finished with her stint on ""Charlie's Angels"", Kate Jackson tries hard to inhabit Claire, but there is frankly little to the character beyond her adoration of Zack. The very bland Michael Ontkean is hardly detectable as Zack, which is a shame since he is the vortex of the triangle and the one going through the identity evolution. As the predatory and soulless Bart, Harry Hamlin fares somewhat better probably because his character provides some palpable friction to the proceedings. It's not too surprising that none of the three leads went on to successful big-screen careers, though they all thrived back on TV again.Arthur Hill and especially Wendy Hiller are wasted in plot devices disguised as supporting characters. It all ends predictably with a scene pilfered from the end of ""The Way We Were"". While the DVD release is much delayed, the print transfer is decent although there are no extras except for a handful of film trailers. There could have been some mention of the film's role in the evolution of gay-themed films but it's probably just as well since the movie is so singularly unmemorable no matter how well intentioned.",2,"Stilted, Antiseptic Romantic Triangle Tale Disguised as a Groundbreaking Gay-Themed Film",1141344000,"03 3, 2006",2006,2837,"['have', 'admit', 'certain', 'time-capsule', 'fascination', 'seeing', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'deal', 'then-forbidden', 'subject', 'unfulfilled', 'gay', 'love', 'specter', 'AIDS', 'Unfortunately', '1982', 'film', 'so', 'emotionally', 'self-contained', 'overly', 'tasteful', 'soap', 'opera', 'storyline', 'chance', 'breathe', 'real', 'life', 'Unsurprisingly', 'was', 'directed', 'Arthur', 'Hiller', 'who', 'made', 'similarly', 'antiseptic', 'Love', 'Story', 'dozen', 'years', 'earlier', 'time', 'around', 'working', 'script', 'openly', 'gay', 'screenwriter', 'Barry', 'Sandler', 'story', 'biographer', 'A.', 'Scott', 'Berg', 'Hiller', 'maneuvers', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'idyllic', 'marriage', 'upcoming', 'TV', 'executive', 'Claire', 'successful', 'doctor', 'Zack', 'shattered', 'sudden', 'presence', 'Bart', 'writer', 'Fitzgerald', 'school', 'emotional', 'nihilism.The', 'set-up', 'so', 'calculated', 'not', 'offend', 'offensive', 'dishonesty', 'first', 'external', 'factors', 'such', 'couple', 'overly', 'romanticized', 'view', 'life', 'together', 'homogenized', 'existence', 'then', 'hollow', 'emotional', 'responses', 'character', 'conveys', 'illusions', 'dissipate', 'film', 'marital', 'disintegration', 'Zack', 'concurrent', 'sexual', 'awakening', 'excruciating', 'detail', 'dialogue', 'by-the-numbers', 'story', 'condescending', 'TV-movie', 'tone', 'especially', 'overly', 'convenient', 'use', 'talking-to-the-camera', 'monologues', 'acting', ""n't"", 'help', 'much', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'three', 'leads', 'having', 'courage', 'accept', 'parts', 'movie', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'diagnosed', 'pre-Brokeback', 'sense', 'cinematic', 'leprosy.Everyone', 'sincere', 'transparent', 'nary', 'hint', 'human', 'complexity', 'Just', 'finished', 'stint', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'hard', 'inhabit', 'Claire', 'frankly', 'little', 'character', 'adoration', 'Zack', 'very', 'bland', 'Michael', 'Ontkean', 'hardly', 'detectable', 'Zack', 'shame', 'vortex', 'triangle', 'one', 'going', 'identity', 'evolution', 'predatory', 'soulless', 'Bart', 'Harry', 'Hamlin', 'somewhat', 'better', 'probably', 'character', 'palpable', 'friction', 'proceedings', 'not', 'too', 'surprising', 'none', 'three', 'leads', 'went', 'successful', 'big-screen', 'careers', 'thrived', 'back', 'TV', 'again.Arthur', 'Hill', 'especially', 'Wendy', 'Hiller', 'are', 'wasted', 'plot', 'devices', 'disguised', 'supporting', 'characters', 'predictably', 'scene', 'pilfered', 'end', 'Way', 'Were', 'DVD', 'release', 'much', 'delayed', 'print', 'transfer', 'decent', 'are', 'extras', 'handful', 'film', 'trailers', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'mention', 'film', 'role', 'evolution', 'gay-themed', 'films', 'probably', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'so', 'singularly', 'unmemorable', 'matter', 'how', 'well', 'intentioned']",N/A

Now looking at it with a christ lke mind, it is truly a movie to appreciate with more than one conclusion to be drawn by many audiences. In one way, you can see it simply as a man finally coming to terms with his real self and embracing it no matter what the cost. Another can see it as the dreadful results of what is still referred to today as a sin, and the way it can destroy what was otherwise a very good marriage, at least from appearances. No matter what, this flim takes a very brutal look at homosexuality, and how real it can be, and the consequences that can follow not just from  getting AIDS. Sadly many can get wounded, and seeing how ""Claire"" had to let go of the man she  loved so he may live out ""his life"" was very sad to see. All the actors were really great in the movie. Harry Hamilin did the role of a swinging single jigilo perfectly, and reminded me of some of the soles i seen like him, but Kate Jackson was really great in this movie as Claire, and is a far cry from some of the other roles she has played in the past ( Remember it was her departure from Charlies Angels that hurt the show then that says a lot).

493948,A1DA6E4FNRSAWN,B000006GDD,Furio,"[3, 3]","This movie was nicely reviewed by Sandy Mc Lendon, David Kucharski and Mark Knight who express much I agree about in a very fine, sensible and sensitive way. Even what I happen not to agree about is very finely written.This is an all time classic for gay people and everyone interested in gay-themed movies.It was one of the first openly gay films ever released by a major (1981 - it seems ages ago now) but this is not all of it.First of all, nobody dies here... well, one side character does, but there is nothing wrong with it because that death has a sense different from mere convenience.The three main characters are, at the end of the film, alive and kicking, all three with a comparatively whole life and many ammunitions still to shoot.Secondly, the setting is rather middle class, well to do, so to say. There are no drag queens (no offence intended, I am just underlining that anything sensational is avoided), no gay-people bashing gangs, no tragic illnesses (AIDS was no issue yet), no intruding cops.This is hardly a coincidence. I am convinced that authors were willing to give such a normal understated approach as was possible and the effort really pays off: no melodrama here, just a lot of raw, tear moving human emotion, a lot of character interaction, a lot of meaningful dialogue.Thirdly, the story may appear a little dated now (costumes really are: dear Goddess, did they really dress like that?): a husband discovering he has repressed his real self for too long, but even admitting it may not be that actual it is so tastefully done, with so much professionality, the the viewer is dragged into this simple story.Not to say that, as another reviewer has already pointed out, coming out is one thing, but learning to accept oneself for what one truly is can never be a dated subject. It can only be ill or well treated.Fourth, the acting is distinguished. Kate Jackson had unfortunately a rather unpleasant acting voice, but she overcomes this problem and gives us an emotion stirring lively figure. I know very little of her two male co-stars but here, helped by a masterful script, they are perfect, always believable and to the point.I believe nobody loving good cinema should miss this one.

493950,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B000006GDD,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 1]","Throughout the 1960s and 1970s Hollywood had a distinct tendency to use homosexuality as a plot device, the ""dirty little secret"" that movitated everything from blackmail to suicide to murder, and with very few exceptions gay characters were inevitably portrayed as weak at best, disturbed to the point of psychosis at worst.  These cinematic ideas reached their height in the 1980 film CRUISING, a viciously homophobic film that flatly portrayed gay men as either preditors or victims--and which proved so distasteful that it largely killed the ""gay man equals bad man"" stereotype that had haunted movie screens for two decades.Released two years after CRUISING, MAKING LOVE was the movie that  marked the shift in Hollywood's perspective, for it posited the idea that a gay man was not necessary a bad man any more than a straight man was necessarily a good one.  It also approached a very difficult subject: the point at which a man conciously begins to recognize that he is homosexual.  At the time, it was tremendously controversial (Kate Jackson was actually booed by a portion of the audience when she appeared on The Tonight Show With Johnny Carson to promote the film), and that controversy generated a tremendous amount of pre-release publicity.The film received very mixed reviews when it opened, and although its first few days in general release showed strong attendance, box office rapidly fell off.  My experience was typical: when I saw the film in theatrical release I had to go alone; the few who were interested in seeing it were afraid to be seen seeing it.  The film was neither a critical nor popular success, and for years Hollywood used its failure as a rationale against creating films with similar themes.All of this said, MAKING LOVE is not a bad film, but neither is it a particularly good one.  The story concerns a happily married Californian couple Zach and Claire (Michael Ontkean and Kate Jackson) who would seem the perfect couple: upwardly mobile, shared interests, and deeply in love.  But unbeknownst to Claire, Zach has found himself increasingly drawn to other men--and when he meets openly gay Bart (Harry Hamlin) he finds he can no longer surpress his hidden reality.  Unfortunately, Zach really does love Clair in an emotional sense; unfortunately, Bart is not interested in a long-term relationship with any one.The cast isn't bad.  Kate Jackson was a major television star at the time, and the film marked her first serious foray onto the big screen; both Michael Ontkean and Harry Hamlin were considered leading men in the making; and popular character actors Wendy Hiller and Arthur Hill were there to lend support.  And in terms of performance alone, they all manage quite well.  Trouble is, they really don't have very much to work with: director Arthur Hill and screenwriter Barry Sandler work themselves to death in an effort to play down virtually every point of interest the story and ideas have.What emerges is day-time soap opera at its least inspired.  You like Zach and Claire and feel sympathetic toward them; even the very dubious Bart has his charms; and although the dithery Winnie Bates (Wendy Hiller) tends to overstay her on-screen welcome she is at least quite charming.  But in the end, MAKING LOVE lacks the courage of its convictions: it is too afraid of its subject to do it justice.All the same, MAKING LOVE did have a significant impact on the way Hollywood portrayed gay characters on screen.  True, there would be no more mainstream gay dramas for two decades, but it did offer an alternative to CRUISING's nastiness, and before the decade ended gay characters would turn up in film after film--never as the central character, always on the sidelines, but increasingly portrayed as real people.  It also undercut the idea that playing a gay character was a career killer for an actor; it is true enough that Jackson, Ontkean, and Hamlin never went on to big screen stardom, but all three have had long and respectable careers in television.The print offered here is good rather than excellent.  The bonus package is disappointing: there is none.  Given the controversy that surrounded the film, it is a tremendous disappointment that there is no 'making of' information of any kind, and it seems a great pity that neither Jackson, Ontkean, or Hamlin are on hand for an audio-commentary.  Recommended, but really of most interest to those tracing the development of gay characters in American cinema.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",3,"Important, But Of More Historical Than Artistic Or Entertainment Interest",1007424000,"12 4, 2001",2001,4491,"['1960s', '1970s', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'distinct', 'tendency', 'use', 'homosexuality', 'plot', 'device', 'dirty', 'little', 'secret', 'movitated', 'everything', 'blackmail', 'suicide', 'murder', 'very', 'few', 'exceptions', 'gay', 'characters', 'were', 'inevitably', 'portrayed', 'weak', 'best', 'disturbed', 'point', 'psychosis', 'worst', 'cinematic', 'ideas', 'reached', 'height', '1980', 'film', 'CRUISING', 'viciously', 'homophobic', 'film', 'flatly', 'portrayed', 'gay', 'men', 'preditors', 'victims', 'proved', 'so', 'distasteful', 'largely', 'killed', 'gay', 'man', 'equals', 'bad', 'man', 'stereotype', 'had', 'haunted', 'movie', 'screens', 'two', 'decades.Released', 'two', 'years', 'CRUISING', 'MAKING', 'LOVE', 'was', 'movie', 'marked', 'shift', 'Hollywood', 'perspective', 'posited', 'idea', 'gay', 'man', 'was', 'not', 'necessary', 'bad', 'man', 'more', 'straight', 'man', 'was', 'necessarily', 'good', 'one', 'also', 'approached', 'very', 'difficult', 'subject', 'point', 'man', 'conciously', 'recognize', 'homosexual', 'time', 'was', 'tremendously', 'controversial', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'was', 'actually', 'booed', 'portion', 'audience', 'when', 'appeared', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'promote', 'film', 'controversy', 'generated', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'pre-release', 'publicity.The', 'film', 'received', 'very', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'when', 'opened', 'first', 'few', 'days', 'general', 'release', 'showed', 'strong', 'attendance', 'box', 'office', 'rapidly', 'fell', 'off', 'experience', 'was', 'typical', 'when', 'saw', 'film', 'theatrical', 'release', 'had', 'go', 'alone', 'few', 'who', 'were', 'interested', 'seeing', 'were', 'afraid', 'be', 'seen', 'seeing', 'film', 'was', 'critical', 'popular', 'success', 'years', 'Hollywood', 'used', 'failure', 'rationale', 'creating', 'films', 'similar', 'themes.All', 'said', 'MAKING', 'LOVE', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'particularly', 'good', 'one', 'story', 'happily', 'married', 'Californian', 'couple', 'Zach', 'Claire', 'Michael', 'Ontkean', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'who', 'would', 'seem', 'perfect', 'couple', 'upwardly', 'shared', 'interests', 'deeply', 'love', 'unbeknownst', 'Claire', 'Zach', 'found', 'increasingly', 'drawn', 'other', 'men', 'when', 'openly', 'gay', 'Bart', 'Harry', 'Hamlin', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'surpress', 'hidden', 'reality', 'Unfortunately', 'Zach', 'really', 'love', 'Clair', 'emotional', 'sense', 'unfortunately', 'Bart', 'not', 'interested', 'long-term', 'relationship', 'one.The', 'cast', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'was', 'major', 'television', 'star', 'time', 'film', 'marked', 'first', 'serious', 'foray', 'big', 'screen', 'Michael', 'Ontkean', 'Harry', 'Hamlin', 'were', 'considered', 'leading', 'men', 'making', 'popular', 'character', 'actors', 'Wendy', 'Hiller', 'Arthur', 'Hill', 'were', 'there', 'lend', 'support', 'terms', 'performance', 'alone', 'manage', 'quite', 'well', 'Trouble', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'much', 'work', 'director', 'Arthur', 'Hill', 'screenwriter', 'Barry', 'Sandler', 'work', 'death', 'effort', 'play', 'down', 'virtually', 'point', 'interest', 'story', 'ideas', 'have.What', 'day-time', 'soap', 'opera', 'least', 'inspired', 'Zach', 'Claire', 'feel', 'sympathetic', 'even', 'very', 'dubious', 'Bart', 'charms', 'dithery', 'Winnie', 'Bates', 'Wendy', 'Hiller', 'overstay', 'on-screen', 'welcome', 'least', 'quite', 'charming', 'end', 'MAKING', 'LOVE', 'courage', 'convictions', 'too', 'afraid', 'subject', 'do', 'justice.All', 'same', 'MAKING', 'LOVE', 'did', 'have', 'significant', 'impact', 'way', 'Hollywood', 'portrayed', 'gay', 'characters', 'screen', 'True', 'would', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'mainstream', 'gay', 'dramas', 'two', 'decades', 'did', 'offer', 'alternative', 'CRUISING', 'nastiness', 'decade', 'ended', 'gay', 'characters', 'would', 'turn', 'up', 'film', 'film', 'never', 'central', 'character', 'always', 'sidelines', 'increasingly', 'portrayed', 'real', 'people', 'also', 'undercut', 'idea', 'playing', 'gay', 'character', 'was', 'career', 'killer', 'actor', 'true', 'enough', 'Jackson', 'Ontkean', 'Hamlin', 'never', 'went', 'big', 'screen', 'stardom', 'three', 'have', 'had', 'long', 'respectable', 'careers', 'television.The', 'print', 'offered', 'here', 'good', 'rather', 'excellent', 'bonus', 'package', 'disappointing', 'none', 'Given', 'controversy', 'surrounded', 'film', 'tremendous', 'disappointment', ""'making"", 'information', 'kind', 'great', 'pity', 'Jackson', 'Ontkean', 'Hamlin', 'are', 'hand', 'audio-commentary', 'Recommended', 'really', 'most', 'interest', 'tracing', 'development', 'gay', 'characters', 'American', 'cinema.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

It was rumored that the film was about ""queers"" and that two of them even kissed onscreen.  Since I was 19 at the time, and uncomfortable with my sexuality, I absolutely was not going to see this film.  What if someone saw me going in the theatre - someone I knew?  I finally relented to seeing a late night showing in an area of town far removed from my own.Times have changed in the twenty years since this film premiered and they have definitely changed for the better.  This film can be considered a milemarker by which we can gauge the leaps and bounds that have been made in society regarding homosexuality.  It's not that the film isn't a quality production.  It is.  It has good acting and a good script (though my personal preference is against having actors speak directly to the audience - it breaks the invisible barrier that exists between the actors and the audience).  Basically, I think this movie was considered ""radical"" at the time by the studio standards, and that has changed so drastically, that this film seems passe.Kate Jackson, Michael Ontkean, and Harry Hamlin give dynamite performances in the lead roles.  I heard rumors that Kate Jackson had gone through a similar situation as her character in her own personal life.  I don't know that this is true.  Jackson broke apart from TV fare with this film, but suprisingly it didn't result in additional film work.  Harry Hamlin cranked out a few films after this, but then went on to an extremely successful television career.  Michael Ontkean, who had previously been in television's The Rookies, suffered greatly from his appearance in this film.  To my knowledge, his career completely dried up afterward.  Such as shame.  He was a capable actor.Today, it seems, that heterosexual actors are chomping at the bit to play gay roles.  They're everywhere: both the roles, the films, and the television and cable shows!  What a huge change from twenty years ago!Interestingly, Making Love is about a subject that is probably LESS addressed today than it was twenty years ago:  a married man, who loves his wife finally admits to himself that he is gay and leaves the marriage.  I'd love to see the subject readdressed with more bite.Twenty years ago we were provided with two big studio productions about homosexuality.  One was a dark, sinister piece about killer [gays] and sadomasochism (""Cruising"") and the other was a piece that showed us that [""gays""] can sometimes be the ""straight-seeming"" conservative fellow next door (""Making Love"").  Today, we've expanded the horizons - thankfully.If you want to see how mainstream Hollywood first addressed the subject of homosexuality on the big screen with a high profile script, actors, director, and production - see Making Love.",3,"Groundbreaking film, showing some wear",1018483200,"04 11, 2002",2002,2818,"['When', 'Making', 'Love', 'hit', 'movie', 'caused', 'quite', 'stir', 'was', 'rumored', 'film', 'was', 'queers', 'two', 'even', 'kissed', 'onscreen', 'was', '19', 'time', 'uncomfortable', 'sexuality', 'absolutely', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'see', 'film', 'What', 'someone', 'saw', 'going', 'theatre', 'someone', 'knew', 'finally', 'relented', 'seeing', 'late', 'night', 'showing', 'area', 'town', 'far', 'removed', 'own.Times', 'have', 'changed', 'twenty', 'years', 'film', 'premiered', 'have', 'definitely', 'changed', 'better', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'milemarker', 'can', 'gauge', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'society', 'regarding', 'homosexuality', 'not', 'film', ""n't"", 'quality', 'production', 'good', 'acting', 'good', 'script', 'personal', 'preference', 'having', 'actors', 'speak', 'directly', 'audience', 'invisible', 'barrier', 'actors', 'audience', 'Basically', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'considered', 'radical', 'time', 'studio', 'standards', 'changed', 'so', 'drastically', 'film', 'passe.Kate', 'Jackson', 'Michael', 'Ontkean', 'Harry', 'Hamlin', 'give', 'dynamite', 'performances', 'lead', 'roles', 'heard', 'rumors', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'had', 'gone', 'similar', 'situation', 'character', 'own', 'personal', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'true', 'Jackson', 'broke', 'apart', 'TV', 'fare', 'film', 'suprisingly', 'did', ""n't"", 'result', 'additional', 'film', 'work', 'Harry', 'Hamlin', 'cranked', 'out', 'few', 'films', 'then', 'went', 'extremely', 'successful', 'television', 'career', 'Michael', 'Ontkean', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'been', 'television', 'Rookies', 'suffered', 'greatly', 'appearance', 'film', 'knowledge', 'career', 'completely', 'dried', 'up', 'afterward', 'Such', 'shame', 'was', 'capable', 'actor.Today', 'heterosexual', 'actors', 'are', 'chomping', 'bit', 'play', 'gay', 'roles', ""'re"", 'everywhere', 'roles', 'films', 'television', 'cable', 'shows', 'What', 'huge', 'change', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'Interestingly', 'Making', 'Love', 'subject', 'probably', 'LESS', 'addressed', 'today', 'was', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'married', 'man', 'who', 'wife', 'finally', 'gay', 'marriage', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'subject', 'readdressed', 'more', 'bite.Twenty', 'years', 'were', 'provided', 'two', 'big', 'studio', 'productions', 'homosexuality', 'One', 'was', 'dark', 'sinister', 'piece', 'killer', '[', ']', 'sadomasochism', 'Cruising', 'other', 'was', 'piece', 'showed', 'gays', ']', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'straight-seeming', 'conservative', 'fellow', 'next', 'door', 'Making', 'Love', 'Today', ""'ve"", 'expanded', 'horizons', 'thankfully.If', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'first', 'addressed', 'subject', 'homosexuality', 'big', 'screen', 'high', 'profile', 'script', 'actors', 'director', 'production', 'see', 'Making', 'Love']",N/A

Many people literally GOT UP AND WALKED OUT after this scene, grumbling, muttering, REACTING to the kiss.

I suppose that would be an accurate assessment in 1982 when the movie opened. With WILL AND GRACE every week for years as well as QUEER AS FOLK  available for television audiences, however, it is difficult to see much controversy in 2006. Yes, there is a real kiss between Michael Ontkean (Zach) and Harry Hamlin (Bart); but the bedroom scenes with everybody involved shouldn't offend your Aunt Hannah. What I found most surprising this time is that I do not believe the word ""gay"" or ""homosexual"" is ever mentioned by anybody in the entire movie. When Zach finally tells Claire (Kate Jackson) what is really wrong with their seven year marriage, he says that he has feelings for other men. That's about as close as he gets to using the G word. The plot is straight-forward. A 30ish L. A. doctor (Ontkean) falls for a patient (Hamlin) and ultimately leaves his wife of seven years (Jackson). Ontkean has all the fears and longings of a man finding himself desiring other men and makes the mistake of many men in his position of assuming that his love object Hamlin wants to move him in and live happily for the foreseeable future. Instead he runs into the wall of the urban gay lifestyle of many men in the early l980's, where lots of sex with a lot of different men without much commitment was the order of the day-- or night.The three actors, through their acting, manage to make this film more than a gay soap although it often does have the feel of a made-for-TV-movie, whatever that means. (The director Arthur Hiller, on the other hand, as well as the actors, is no stranger to televsion drama.)In spite of the almost too cute names-- Zach, Bart, Claire and Baby Rupert-- the film ultimately makes a decent statement about a very difficult subject: what is a man to do when he figures out that, although he loves his wife deeply, he wants to spend the rest of his life with another man.This film is much better than I remembered.",4,Better Than I Remembered,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,2017,"['MAKING', 'LOVE', 'described', 'original', 'trailer', 'film', 'controversial', 'suppose', 'would', 'be', 'accurate', 'assessment', '1982', 'when', 'movie', 'opened', 'WILL', 'AND', 'GRACE', 'week', 'years', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'QUEER', 'FOLK', 'available', 'television', 'audiences', 'however', 'difficult', 'see', 'much', 'controversy', '2006', 'Yes', 'real', 'kiss', 'Michael', 'Ontkean', 'Zach', 'Harry', 'Hamlin', 'Bart', 'bedroom', 'scenes', 'everybody', 'involved', 'should', ""n't"", 'offend', 'Aunt', 'Hannah', 'What', 'found', 'most', 'surprising', 'time', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'word', 'gay', 'homosexual', 'ever', 'mentioned', 'anybody', 'entire', 'movie', 'When', 'Zach', 'finally', 'Claire', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'what', 'really', 'wrong', 'seven', 'year', 'marriage', 'feelings', 'other', 'men', 'about', 'as', 'close', 'using', 'G', 'word', 'plot', 'straight-forward', '30ish', 'L.', 'A.', 'doctor', 'Ontkean', 'patient', 'Hamlin', 'ultimately', 'wife', 'seven', 'years', 'Jackson', 'Ontkean', 'fears', 'longings', 'man', 'finding', 'desiring', 'other', 'men', 'mistake', 'many', 'men', 'position', 'assuming', 'love', 'object', 'Hamlin', 'move', 'live', 'happily', 'foreseeable', 'future', 'Instead', 'wall', 'urban', 'gay', 'lifestyle', 'many', 'men', 'early', 'l980', 'where', 'lots', 'sex', 'lot', 'different', 'men', 'much', 'commitment', 'was', 'order', 'day', 'night.The', 'three', 'actors', 'acting', 'manage', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'gay', 'soap', 'often', 'have', 'feel', 'made-for-TV-movie', 'director', 'Arthur', 'Hiller', 'other', 'hand', 'as', 'well', 'actors', 'stranger', 'televsion', 'drama', 'spite', 'almost', 'too', 'cute', 'names', 'Zach', 'Bart', 'Claire', 'Baby', 'Rupert', 'film', 'ultimately', 'decent', 'statement', 'very', 'difficult', 'subject', 'what', 'man', 'do', 'when', 'out', 'wife', 'deeply', 'spend', 'rest', 'life', 'man.This', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'remembered']",N/A

493959,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B000006GDD,James Morris,"[22, 22]","This was the first mainstream film in which gay men got to see themselves portrayed in a positive light, and probably the first American film to portray gay people without resorting to stereotypes.When I bought my VHS copy in the early 90's, it was already out-of-print, and I paid more for it then any other VHS film I ever bought in my life (over $60, if I recall).  Even so, to this day, I don't regret a penny of it.  Now that Fox Studios, who owns the rights to this gay classic has finally conceded to release it on DVD, I am optimistic that The Boys in the Band and the Lost Language of Cranes, two other classic gay dramas which Fox also owns, may follow.Let's hope so.The film may seem quaint and quite mild by today's standards, but in 1982, positive images of gay men in Hollywood films simply did not exist.  Prior to Making Love, gay men in American movies were either suicidal sissies or vicious villains.  The best we could hope for was that some sympathetic director might tone down the images of gays as sick and evil, a rendering that was more or less dictated by the censorship codes that were in force for much of the first hundred years of Hollywood history.  Indeed, the negative but harmless 1930s classic ""sissy,"" eventually gave way to darker portrayals of gay people as inhabitants of a shadowy world of villains and degenerates.  Hollywood's version of gay people was as unrealistic and damaging as any propaganda ever wielded against any minority, anywhere.  Therefore, the film Making Love can be seen as nothing less than a radical departure from the standard Hollywood negative portrayal of gays.  The producers and production team of Making Love went out of their way to make the gay characters as likeable and attractive as possible, and, at the time, I don't remember any of my friends who saw the film who weren't grateful for that alone.Many people have dismissed this film as a ""soap opera"" and claim that the basic plot is unbelievable.  Interestingly enough, a lesbian friend of mine had the greatest identification of anyone I knew with the character played by Michael Ontkean - she said that when she was coming out as a lesbian, and married at the time, her marriage was exactly like the couple in this movie.  The lies, the sneaking around, the nervous confrontation with her spouse - she lived it all, and she felt that the film very accurately portrayed her real life situation.  So don't let anyone tell you that this ""soap opera"" is totally unbelievable, for I know someone who lived it.Enough cannot be said about Kate Jackson's wonderful performance.  This is possibly the best role she ever tackled, and almost definitely the best acting she ever did.  Arthur Hiller's direction is perfect, and he is also assigned a small supporting role as Zack's father.  Wendy Hiller, as a compassionate friend of the married couple, gives an excellent supporting performance, as she does in every role she undertakes.Harry Hamlin and Michael Ontkean as the two leads (both of whom are straight and were very nervous and also very brave about taking these parts) are cute enough to make the romantic in my soul enjoy this film even for the wrong reasons.  Buy it for the right reasons - it's a piece of gay history, and one of the first American films to deal with homosexuality in a positive light.",5,Historic Gay Drama Finally Coming to DVD,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,3336,"['was', 'first', 'mainstream', 'film', 'gay', 'men', 'got', 'see', 'portrayed', 'positive', 'light', 'probably', 'first', 'American', 'film', 'portray', 'gay', 'people', 'resorting', 'stereotypes.When', 'bought', 'VHS', 'copy', 'early', '90', 'was', 'already', 'out-of-print', 'paid', 'more', 'then', 'other', 'VHS', 'film', 'ever', 'bought', 'life', '60', 'recall', 'Even', 'so', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'penny', 'Now', 'Fox', 'Studios', 'who', 'rights', 'gay', 'classic', 'finally', 'conceded', 'release', 'DVD', 'am', 'optimistic', 'Boys', 'Band', 'Lost', 'Language', 'Cranes', 'two', 'other', 'classic', 'gay', 'dramas', 'Fox', 'also', 'may', 'follow.Let', 'hope', 'so.The', 'film', 'may', 'seem', 'quaint', 'quite', 'mild', 'today', 'standards', '1982', 'positive', 'images', 'gay', 'men', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'exist', 'Prior', 'Making', 'Love', 'gay', 'men', 'American', 'movies', 'were', 'either', 'suicidal', 'sissies', 'vicious', 'villains', 'best', 'could', 'hope', 'was', 'sympathetic', 'director', 'might', 'tone', 'down', 'images', 'gays', 'sick', 'evil', 'rendering', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'dictated', 'censorship', 'codes', 'were', 'force', 'much', 'first', 'hundred', 'years', 'Hollywood', 'history', 'Indeed', 'negative', 'harmless', '1930s', 'classic', 'sissy', 'eventually', 'gave', 'way', 'darker', 'portrayals', 'gay', 'people', 'inhabitants', 'shadowy', 'world', 'villains', 'degenerates', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'gay', 'people', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'damaging', 'propaganda', 'ever', 'wielded', 'minority', 'anywhere', 'Therefore', 'film', 'Making', 'Love', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'nothing', 'less', 'radical', 'departure', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'negative', 'portrayal', 'gays', 'producers', 'production', 'team', 'Making', 'Love', 'went', 'way', 'make', 'gay', 'characters', 'likeable', 'attractive', 'possible', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'friends', 'who', 'saw', 'film', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'grateful', 'alone.Many', 'people', 'have', 'dismissed', 'film', 'soap', 'opera', 'claim', 'basic', 'plot', 'unbelievable', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'lesbian', 'friend', 'mine', 'had', 'greatest', 'identification', 'anyone', 'knew', 'character', 'played', 'Michael', 'Ontkean', 'said', 'when', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'lesbian', 'married', 'time', 'marriage', 'was', 'exactly', 'couple', 'movie', 'lies', 'sneaking', 'around', 'nervous', 'confrontation', 'spouse', 'lived', 'felt', 'film', 'very', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'real', 'life', 'situation', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'anyone', 'tell', 'soap', 'opera', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'know', 'someone', 'who', 'lived', 'it.Enough', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'possibly', 'best', 'role', 'ever', 'tackled', 'almost', 'definitely', 'best', 'acting', 'ever', 'did', 'Arthur', 'Hiller', 'direction', 'perfect', 'also', 'assigned', 'small', 'supporting', 'role', 'Zack', 'father', 'Wendy', 'Hiller', 'compassionate', 'friend', 'married', 'couple', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'performance', 'role', 'undertakes.Harry', 'Hamlin', 'Michael', 'Ontkean', 'two', 'leads', 'whom', 'are', 'straight', 'were', 'very', 'nervous', 'also', 'very', 'brave', 'taking', 'parts', 'are', 'cute', 'enough', 'make', 'romantic', 'soul', 'enjoy', 'film', 'even', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'Buy', 'right', 'reasons', 'piece', 'gay', 'history', 'one', 'first', 'American', 'films', 'deal', 'homosexuality', 'positive', 'light']",N/A

Making Love is something I will not forget. It presented an unconventional theme during its time: the difficulty of Zach coming out late in his life, the inevitable acceptance by his wife on his homosexuality, and his relationship with the wandering writer Bart.The acting of the three leads are commendable. Kate Jackson shows her dramatic side quite different from her Charlie's Angels role. You can feel Michael Ontkean's loneliness as a closeted guy thru his eyes. And Harry Hamlin delivered his noncommittal gay convincingly.The showing of the characters' faces at the start with the lovely Leonard Rosenman music is a prelude to the drama which will unfold. I personally love the narration style of the two leads of Claire and Bart as they talk to the audience on their feelings about Zach. Look at Kate crying when she narrated "" I miss him..I miss the lousy piano playing..."" real fine acting!Making Love the theme song was composed by Burt Bacharach, Carole Bayer Sager and Bruce Roberts and sung by soulful Roberta Flack at the film's end.

493961,A2JBVRCJ8VS7PQ,B000006GDD,Jerry (Celil) Parker,"[1, 1]","I first saw ""Making Love"", when the film was released, back in 1982. At that time, I saw it at a theatre with one of my pals (and for many years an on-again, off-again gay boyfriend), a strikingly beautiful and very sexy younger man, C.J. We both detested it, mainly because it seemed so little related to our own existences, and to the lives of our homosexual acquaintances, as working gay men. C.J. was and remains a radical gay activist, so I suppose that his militantly gay hostility to it affected my perception of the film considerably; desire and affection for another will influence and colour one`s view of such things!What made me gag at the film, and partly what bothered C.J., too, is the upper-crust, high-income setting of the young married couple`s (and hence the young doctor`s) opulently privileged way of life; the media made much back then of how affluent and hyper-consumerist gays tend to be, and the movie only greatly reaffirmed that widespread, prejudiced perception, making it hard for many gay men to care about the fate of such ""lounge lizard"" cinematic dudes as Zach and Bart!At one point over the years I had gotten around to reading Leonore Fleischer novelisation (Ballantine Books, 1982, paperback) of the film. (At least, I am fairly certain that I recall that the book derives from the movie and its filmscript, rather than that the book, as usally happens, inspires the film.) Although some of the ""pschobabble"" and sentimentality is even more unbearably present in the book than in the movie, it actually helps me, on seeing the movie again after so many years, this time in French, to have read that novelised version, which makes some of the action and motivation clearer in one`s mind, despite all the smarminess that the book only serves to aggravate in some ways.However, I put the VHS tape of it in my player tonight and I found that the film really does have much to offer. I still think that it is too sentimental and ""pat"" in its attempt to validate gay life. Really, all that endless psychobabble, especially when the two men and the woman of the love and matrimony-gone-wrong sexual triangle speak directly from the screen to the viewer: that`s very, very heavy handed and manipulative!The film is worth seeing, in English or another language, despite its limitations. Its biggest fault perhaps simply was ""trying too hard"" to make a depiction of gay life and byways acceptable to a wide audience, which it failed to do then and probably does not succeed now in accomplishing, either. It`s a gay movement relic now, but one that can bear the examination of it, despite everything.",3,"Wealthy, Attractive Young Bisexual Male Doctor Dumps His Faithful Wife for a Gay ""Boy Toy"" Aspiring Writer: Tacky but Touching",1356566400,"12 27, 2012",2012,2626,"['first', 'saw', 'Making', 'Love', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'back', '1982', 'time', 'saw', 'theatre', 'one', 'pals', 'many', 'years', 'on-again', 'off-again', 'gay', 'boyfriend', 'strikingly', 'beautiful', 'very', 'sexy', 'younger', 'man', 'C.J', 'detested', 'mainly', 'seemed', 'so', 'little', 'related', 'own', 'existences', 'lives', 'homosexual', 'acquaintances', 'working', 'gay', 'men', 'C.J', 'was', 'radical', 'gay', 'activist', 'suppose', 'militantly', 'gay', 'hostility', 'affected', 'perception', 'film', 'considerably', 'desire', 'affection', 'will', 'influence', 'colour', 'one', 's', 'view', 'such', 'things', 'What', 'made', 'gag', 'film', 'partly', 'what', 'bothered', 'C.J.', 'too', 'upper-crust', 'high-income', 'setting', 'young', 'married', 'couple', 's', 'hence', 'young', 'doctor', 's', 'opulently', 'privileged', 'way', 'life', 'media', 'made', 'much', 'back', 'then', 'how', 'affluent', 'hyper-consumerist', 'gays', 'tend', 'be', 'movie', 'only', 'greatly', 'reaffirmed', 'widespread', 'prejudiced', 'perception', 'making', 'hard', 'many', 'gay', 'men', 'care', 'fate', 'such', 'lounge', 'lizard', 'cinematic', 'dudes', 'Zach', 'Bart', 'one', 'point', 'years', 'had', 'gotten', 'reading', 'Leonore', 'Fleischer', 'novelisation', 'Ballantine', 'Books', '1982', 'paperback', 'film', 'least', 'am', 'fairly', 'certain', 'recall', 'book', 'movie', 'filmscript', 'rather', 'book', 'usally', 'film', 'pschobabble', 'sentimentality', 'even', 'more', 'unbearably', 'present', 'book', 'movie', 'actually', 'seeing', 'movie', 'again', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'time', 'French', 'have', 'read', 'novelised', 'version', 'action', 'motivation', 'clearer', 'one', 's', 'mind', 'smarminess', 'book', 'only', 'aggravate', 'ways.However', 'put', 'VHS', 'tape', 'player', 'tonight', 'found', 'film', 'really', 'have', 'much', 'offer', 'still', 'think', 'too', 'sentimental', 'pat', 'attempt', 'validate', 'gay', 'life', 'Really', 'endless', 'psychobabble', 'especially', 'when', 'two', 'men', 'woman', 'love', 'matrimony-gone-wrong', 'sexual', 'triangle', 'speak', 'directly', 'screen', 'viewer', 's', 'very', 'very', 'heavy', 'handed', 'manipulative', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'English', 'language', 'limitations', 'biggest', 'fault', 'perhaps', 'simply', 'was', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'make', 'depiction', 'gay', 'life', 'byways', 'acceptable', 'wide', 'audience', 'failed', 'do', 'then', 'probably', 'not', 'succeed', 'now', 'accomplishing', 'either', 's', 'gay', 'movement', 'relic', 'now', 'one', 'can', 'bear', 'examination', 'everything']",N/A
493962,A1QHEQII6QRVND,B000006GDD,J.G.,"[4, 6]","This is one of those films that makes your realize just how far we've come from quality, creative filmmaking. I was really shocked at how much I enjoyed this film the second time around so many years later. It must be that I'm so bored with modern crap. At the time this film was released in 1982 (just prior to AIDS becoming a household word), it was considered rather dull and contrite. I remember watching it when I was a kid, and thought it was a snoozer, too. Now, 27 years later, it's like watching a masterpiece in comparison to the banal, preachy crap that is released today. ""Making Love"" is a perfect example of a pre-PC film, which is frank in its depiction of the characters' lives, the good and the bad, foregoing artificial representations merely to perpetuate a political agenda. Unlike most today's films, the plot in ""Making Love"" stays true to form, the characters are believable and don't sway from their true natures merely to express a politically correct viewpoint, and the director trusts the audiences' intelligence by keeping the camera on the characters and the scenes. There is nothing flashy or forced. The film coloring is typical of the 1980s: very autumn-like, doing away with flashy color so that the audience can focus on the characters and their story. Some viewers may consider the scenes where the individual characters talk to the audience as disjointing, as I did back when it was first released, but watching it now I realize they are necessary in giving the viewers a more in-depth understanding of the characters. The performances are honest and believable. Kate Jackson acts like anyone would if they learned their husband were gay. Michael Ontkean is perfect for the role of the sexually confused husband. And Harry Hamlin (one of People magazine's ""Most Beautiful Men Alive"" celebrities in the 1980s), is realistic as a gallivanting single gay man in the pre-AIDS days. There are no ""heroes"" or ""villains"" in this film as they have in today's silly movies. There's just people, with lives. If ""Making Love"" were made today, it would most likely be filled with homophobes and bad guys looking to harm the ""innocent"" characters all in true PC form. The audience would undoubtedly be bashed over the head with preachiness and false PC depictions of gay life, which, in reality, comes in as many forms as ""straight"" life. When ""Brokeback Mountain"" was released in 2006, I didn't quite understand why so many people lauded it as a milestone in gay filmmaking when 25 years earlier ""Making Love"" was targeted to mainstream audiences as well. People's knowledge of the past is extremely limited these days. I would recommend this film to appreciate the finer qualities of filmmaker prior to the PC error, and also for an interesting history of how tolerant Americans were even in the early 1980s. I agree with many of the other reviews: ""Making Love"" is destined to become a classic that must be seen, especially when compared with today's simplistic and spurious garbage.",4,Destined to become a classic,1231804800,"01 13, 2009",2009,3009,"['one', 'films', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'far', ""'ve"", 'come', 'quality', 'creative', 'filmmaking', 'was', 'really', 'shocked', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'must', 'be', ""'m"", 'so', 'bored', 'modern', 'crap', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1982', 'just', 'prior', 'AIDS', 'becoming', 'household', 'word', 'was', 'considered', 'rather', 'dull', 'contrite', 'remember', 'watching', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'thought', 'was', 'snoozer', 'too', 'Now', '27', 'years', 'later', 'watching', 'masterpiece', 'comparison', 'banal', 'preachy', 'crap', 'released', 'today', 'Making', 'Love', 'perfect', 'example', 'pre-PC', 'film', 'frank', 'depiction', 'characters', 'lives', 'good', 'bad', 'foregoing', 'artificial', 'representations', 'merely', 'perpetuate', 'political', 'agenda', 'most', 'today', 'films', 'plot', 'Making', 'Love', 'true', 'form', 'characters', 'are', 'believable', 'do', ""n't"", 'sway', 'true', 'natures', 'merely', 'express', 'politically', 'correct', 'viewpoint', 'director', 'audiences', 'intelligence', 'keeping', 'camera', 'characters', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'flashy', 'forced', 'film', 'coloring', 'typical', '1980s', 'very', 'autumn-like', 'doing', 'away', 'flashy', 'color', 'audience', 'can', 'focus', 'characters', 'story', 'viewers', 'may', 'consider', 'scenes', 'where', 'individual', 'characters', 'talk', 'audience', 'disjointing', 'did', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'watching', 'now', 'realize', 'are', 'necessary', 'giving', 'viewers', 'more', 'in-depth', 'understanding', 'characters', 'performances', 'are', 'honest', 'believable', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'anyone', 'would', 'learned', 'husband', 'were', 'gay', 'Michael', 'Ontkean', 'perfect', 'role', 'sexually', 'confused', 'husband', 'Harry', 'Hamlin', 'one', 'People', 'magazine', 'Most', 'Beautiful', 'Men', 'Alive', 'celebrities', '1980s', 'realistic', 'gallivanting', 'single', 'gay', 'man', 'pre-AIDS', 'days', 'are', 'heroes', 'villains', 'film', 'have', 'today', 'silly', 'movies', 'just', 'people', 'lives', 'Making', 'Love', 'were', 'made', 'today', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'filled', 'homophobes', 'bad', 'guys', 'looking', 'harm', 'innocent', 'characters', 'true', 'PC', 'form', 'audience', 'would', 'undoubtedly', 'be', 'bashed', 'head', 'preachiness', 'false', 'PC', 'depictions', 'gay', 'life', 'reality', 'many', 'forms', 'straight', 'life', 'When', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'was', 'released', '2006', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'lauded', 'milestone', 'gay', 'filmmaking', 'when', '25', 'years', 'earlier', 'Making', 'Love', 'was', 'targeted', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'as', 'well', 'People', 'knowledge', 'past', 'extremely', 'limited', 'days', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'appreciate', 'finer', 'qualities', 'filmmaker', 'prior', 'PC', 'error', 'also', 'interesting', 'history', 'how', 'tolerant', 'Americans', 'were', 'even', 'early', '1980s', 'agree', 'many', 'other', 'reviews', 'Making', 'Love', 'destined', 'become', 'classic', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'today', 'simplistic', 'spurious', 'garbage']",N/A

When I saw it in 1982 in Pompano Beach, Florida, there was considerable uproar in the theater at the moment of this kiss. Looking back at the film in 2013, I am amazed by how far we have come as a culture. The emotions of this film still ring true, and that is why I consider it a classic film; it was a seminal moment in gay film-making at the time, and the movie can still take viewers to another world, despite the time which has passed since its making. I identify with the Michael Ontkean character in his search for monogamous love in the gay world in the 1980s, but instead initially finding only gay men who are searching for short-term hookups. Who could have imagined that almost 30 years later, gays would be clamoring to tie the knot like their heterosexual counterparts. This is a film which I believe belongs in your film collection, and also a film that should be viewed every once in a while to remind us how far gays have come in their struggle for equality. But most importantly, this film is art and never fails to teach viewers something new about our humanity. The song, &#34;Making Love&#34; sung by Roberta Flack adds such poignancy to the touching ending of the film: I keep repeating the scene when Michael Ontkean visits Kate Jackson years after they have divorced, and they clearly still care about each other, but they are now happy in their new lives. They ask each other are they happy, and they answer yes, respectively, and Michael slightly brushes her cheek, gets into his car and drives away and Roberta Flack sings &#34;Making Love&#34; ... sounds corny, but it's oohh sooo beautiful ...",5,Making Love: A Gay Classic,1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,1766,"['remember', 'seeing', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'there', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'controversy', 'kiss', 'Michael', 'Ontkean', 'Harry', 'Hamlin', 'When', 'saw', '1982', 'Pompano', 'Beach', 'Florida', 'was', 'considerable', 'uproar', 'theater', 'moment', 'kiss', 'Looking', 'back', 'film', '2013', 'am', 'amazed', 'how', 'far', 'have', 'come', 'culture', 'emotions', 'film', 'still', 'ring', 'true', 'why', 'consider', 'classic', 'film', 'was', 'seminal', 'moment', 'gay', 'film-making', 'time', 'movie', 'can', 'still', 'take', 'viewers', 'world', 'time', 'passed', 'making', 'identify', 'Michael', 'Ontkean', 'character', 'search', 'monogamous', 'love', 'gay', 'world', '1980s', 'instead', 'initially', 'finding', 'only', 'gay', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'searching', 'short-term', 'hookups', 'Who', 'could', 'have', 'imagined', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'later', 'gays', 'would', 'be', 'clamoring', 'tie', 'knot', 'heterosexual', 'counterparts', 'film', 'believe', 'belongs', 'film', 'collection', 'also', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'once', 'while', 'remind', 'how', 'far', 'gays', 'have', 'come', 'struggle', 'equality', 'most', 'importantly', 'film', 'art', 'never', 'teach', 'viewers', 'something', 'new', 'humanity', 'song', '34', 'Making', 'Love', '34', 'sung', 'Roberta', 'Flack', 'such', 'poignancy', 'touching', 'ending', 'film', 'keep', 'repeating', 'scene', 'when', 'Michael', 'Ontkean', 'visits', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'years', 'have', 'divorced', 'clearly', 'still', 'care', 'other', 'are', 'now', 'happy', 'new', 'lives', 'ask', 'other', 'are', 'happy', 'answer', 'yes', 'respectively', 'Michael', 'slightly', 'cheek', 'car', 'away', 'Roberta', 'Flack', '34', 'Making', 'Love', '34', 'corny', 'oohh', 'sooo', 'beautiful']",N/A

The critical response was mixed at best. The heterosexual audience shouted negative comments during the boy on boy kissing scenes. The gay audience members were not enough to assure financial success. However, the film now deserves a reappraisal.I didn't like the movie when it first came out. For many years I thought it was a bland, over glamorized, unrealistic depiction of a gay man coming out, and leaving his wife. In spite of what some people have said, this was NOT the first positive film about a gay man released by a major studio. Look back 10 years to United Artists ""Sunday, Bloody Sunday"" for that Big First. ""Sunday.."" even had a love scene involving a passionate kiss between Peter Finch and Murray Head. And yeah, straight people grossed out in that one too. ""Sunday, Bloody Sunday"" was also hailed as a cinematic masterpiece by the critics. However, again, director John Schlesinger's film didn't make a dime at the box office.As I watched ""Making Love"" in 2007, post ""Brokeback Mountain,"" I saw the film for it's very real virtues. The cast of Kate Jackson, Harry Hamlin and Michael Ontkean is attractive and affecting. So what if you're always aware of them acting? Most of the movies Hollywood releases every year involve artificial performances from major name players. Ontkean in particular gives a nicely understated interpretation.Even if certain scenes don't ring true, such as the talking heads telling the audience their feelings rather than the script demonstrating those emotions, and the dialogue is somewhat trite at times (""What about passion! What about support!""), the basic conflict of the characters does.I hadn't realized how important the Ontkean/Hamlin love scene and the happy ending, were until after seeing 1993's ""Philadelphia""  neuter any feelings of physical passion from Tom Hanks and Antonio Banderas' lovers, and the furer that greeted ""Brokeback Mountain"" last year.In the mid-2000's no major American gay movie star has yet to come out of the closet. Patricia Nell Warren STILL cannot get her very moving, very dramatic 1974 novel, ""The Front Runner"" made into a movie. Hollywood producers, gay and straight, are still terrified of presenting an honest depiction of of gay people without tragic consequences as a main subject(see ""Brokeback..."" and ""Philadelphia"" again).

It's a lot clearer on DVD, but the print is not as good as it could have been.

It is not really stereo, but more of an enhanced, dual mono type of sound.  It sounds OK on headphones.  You can hear this hiss of the film in the background, so this indicates to me that the soundtrack dialogue was never re-mastered for this release.  It was still rare back in 1982 for a movie to be offered in Dolby Stereo, the majority were still released in Mono.  There is also the choice of the dialogue in French Mono, Spanish Mono, or English/Spanish subtitles.  The original theatrical trailer is an added feature too.

I hesitated writing a review for it because of that fact. But then I realized that if you're reviewing a DVD, 90% of the review must be based on the movie itself, and having saw the movie when it was released, and having seen it again on the various cable channels, I felt I could write a respectable reveiw.Frankly, the movie barely approaches a ""B-Movie"" status. It's only claim to fame is that it was the first major Hollywood motion picture that did not portray homosexuals in a bad light.The plot is rather unbelievable, naming the fact that all three main characters are leaders in their field.... successful author, high-ranking network producer, top-rate doctor. Nobody has a profession, or is in a position, with which the audience can relate. The dialog is forced and, at times, rather cliche. Acting is acceptable, though supporting cast members are rather amateurish. Direction is functional, at best.One glaring problem is the tendency for the movie to suddenly switch from drama to documentary. After or before key scenes, the camera cuts to a monologue from one of the main characters. The effect is startling, doesn't advance the story, and only serves to distract the viewers and lessen the already-weak emotional impact of the film.To its credit, the actors did whole-heartedly portray gay characters and gay love scenes. At the time, gay characters were never portrayed in a positive light from the media, and it was a great risk to do so here. There were no previous movie experiences of this topic that the director and actors were able to draw on, and they did the best they could.It was a very ambitious project and was supposed to be ground-breaking and revolutionary, but the weaknesses in the film never raised it high enough to truly make much of a difference in society. This is absolutely proven by the fact that Brokeback Mountain, released about two decades later, had to work very hard to break the same stereotypes that Making Love previously attempted to break. The difference is that Brokeback Mountain was a true work of art impeccable in its execution and actually broke ground and stereotypes, and Making Love all but disappeared in the annals of time.If you're a collector of good film, this really wouldn't be part of your collection.

493978,A2G935GMRAUIRW,B000006GDD,Sandy McLendon,"[103, 104]","Many movies that are now considered classics didn't start out that way.  &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; turned only a modest profit as a new release.  &quot;Casablanca&quot; did okay, but it was forgotten for years until TV showings made it an audience favourite.  &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; was little short of a box-office disaster.&quot;Making Love&quot; is newer than those films, but it seems to be following the same path.  In first release, it was dismissed as too softly soapy by gay audiences and as too much by straight ones, primarily because of one gorgeously sensual kiss between its two male stars.  Twenty years on, we've all calmed down, and &quot;Making Love&quot; is looking better and better.Although the script falls into the usual Hollywood trap of making everyone in the film devastatingly attractive and well over the median income line, Michael Ontkean, Harry Hamlin, and Kate Jackson deliver honest emotional connection with their characters.  Jackson is the surprise of the film, turning in a powerful performance that will surprise &quot;Charlie's Angels&quot; fans.  Ontkean's sensitive portrayal of a man who realises he's gay after eight years of marriage is a tour-de-force.  Hamlin delivers, too, fleshing out the movie's love triangle as a writer who brings Ontkean's character out, then dumps him because he's afraid of commitment.Yes, &quot;Making Love&quot; is something of a soap opera, and yes, it's a bit too determined to avoid giving offence.  It still treads where very few movies dare to go, into the hearts of good people trying to make the best of a difficult situation.  Even at its end, the film yields surprises. Kate Jackson's character is seen as content with her remarriage after losing Ontkean; using the most economical means, Jackson lets us know that her gay ex-husband was truly the love of her life, and that her ultimate act of love was to let him go.There are two names seldom mentioned in connection with this movie that should be singled out:  Dame Wendy Hiller and Daniel Melnick.  Dame Wendy is a delight as Winnie Bates, a neighbour who is friend to the young gay doctor and his wife; her performance gives &quot;Making Love&quot; much of its texture.  And Daniel Melnick, as producer, deserves kudos, too.  Melnick's early career was in 1950's TV, when the tube still had some notions of social responsibility.  That ethic carries over into &quot;Making Love&quot;; Melnick took an extraordinary professional risk putting his name on this movie, and he is owed a debt of gratitude by everyone who loves &quot;Making Love&quot;.  Melnick's next film was &quot;Footloose&quot;, so he landed on his feet, if ever anyone did.Again, it's a great little movie, and you won't regret making the acquaintance of the people so lovingly brought to life in it.

493984,A11BCJJG91KVOY,B000006GDD,"tmp ""snippy reviewer""","[4, 8]","An interesting artifact of the early 80's, ""Making Love"" chronicles the travails of Clair (Kate Jackson) and Zack (Micheal Ontkean), cutely married and new home buyers in the Hollywood Hills.  Predating the WE network by a solid two decades, there's a fly in the ointment: Zack harbors a secret hankering for Men (as a matter of fact, the sight of two hunks on a motorbike at an intersection makes him choose to buy the house).  Sadly for Clair, Zack meets brooding writer Bart (Harry Hamlin), and his reaction to the meeting is not a trip to IKEA for some patio furniture.  He falls instantly, madly, and inexplicably in love: inexplicably because Bart is written as one of the most unloveable character in the movie, if not the hemisphere.  The movie opens with the now hoary device of having the principals stare into the camera and talk about their feelings against a blinding white background, as if they were in God's waiting room, or at the Apple store.  In this case, it's Clair and Bart talking about Zack, so much so that you wonder if Zack is dead by the end of the movie. [spoiler] He's not, he's just in New York.  Which may be the same thing to the film-makers.The actors do what they can with the material: Kate Jackson fares the best.  I don't know if her throw-away line ""Did you eat a cookie?"" was in the script or an ad-lib, her delivery is so perfectly off-hand that I can't tell.  She really makes you wonder what would have happened if someone had given her a really meaty part.  Harry Hamlin does what he can with a part that is basically an unlikeable mess, and Michael Ontkean is so-so as the lead.  He's not good enough to show that Zack is really torn between his deep love for Clair and his sexual attraction to men, which makes his character seem kind of less-than-nice.  Actually, Nice is the big problem here: everybody connected with the movie wanted to make it so accessable, and not offend anyone that you get the idea that finding out your husband likes guys is about as tragic as losing a really cherished hamster.  The scene that shocked me at the time (Yes, I saw it when it first ran) was the scene where Kate Jackson goes to visit a guy that Zack tricked with.  The guy lives in a dingy single, with crummy furniture and a jar of Vaseline on the nightstand.  After 2 hours of early 80's cutting edge tech and sunny interiors, it's as if suddenly we got a scene that was taken over by Fassbinder.  That is until they start talking about their feelings again.Needless to say, they end up sadder but wiser, Clair and Zack each with handsome hubbies, and Bart bonding with his Betamax.  An interesting look at pre-AIDS LA, with a few West Hollywood locations that are still there today, like Dan Tana's.

I didn't see ""Making Love"" until it hit a cable film channel a year later.  I do remember my college paper having a review of it, and being very intrigued.  I saw it in January 1983, and it spoke to me volumes.  It was my drop of rain in a figurative desert environment growing up in Oklahoma.  I will subjectively give it 5 stars despite it's technical mistakes.  Although it is good, it reminds me of a Lifetime Television film.The poem ""Farewell my Dover maiden, alabaster and lapis lazuli..."", and the references to Gilbert and Sullivan were nice inclusions.  The good acting makes up for the sometimes awkward dialogue and attempts at humour.  The cinematography is well orchestrated in most scenes, especially when Bart is walking by a reflective surface near the end of the film and there are rhythmic divisions in his reflection suggesting a visually poetic repetition of his one-night-stand behaviour.Some questionably humorous subtleties are noticeable.  When Bart and Zach are walking after their first dinner together, there is a sign in the left of the frame which reads ""Welcome to Dan Tannas /Parking in Rear"".  Further, when Claire finds a matchbook phone number in Zach's pocket, she visits the stranger, and there's a jar of Vaseline on the table next to the sofa.  There are a couple of loops that are evident, and an editing flub which cuts abruptly from Zach's hand on Bart's shoulder to the end of an embrace or kiss, which indicates some questionable editing.  The sound for the DVD is a choice between stereo or mono, and why would anyone choose mono in 2006?  Not being a sound effects film, that's not a major disappointment.I fell in love with Zach.  I wondered, ""Where is this man?""  His character is what drew me to see this film dozens of times in repeat airings.The final scene is heartbreaking, feeling somewhat like the final scene of resolution in ""Brokeback Mountain"" (compare the final lines of both films).  The music score, and Roberta Flack theme song are very nice and lend considerably to the overall mood.  This is a great little film for the price to have in any collection of gay/lesbian films.

493987,A1RRPBF14VTAUE,B000006GDD,Tucker,"[6, 10]","Finally, ""Making Love"" is released on DVD. For those of you questioning my rating, let me explain. The ratings are supposed to be for the product (the DVD) not the film itself. I give the DVD a 2-star rating simply because it contains no extras. No commentary track, no ""making of"" featurette, no deleted scenes, no bloopers, no nothing (unless you count the trailer......and I don't count the trailer). The film I give a 3 1/2 to 4 star rating or a 5 star rating simply because Kate Jackson is in it.Considered controversial and ground breaking for its time, today (as another reviewer mentioned) in the days of ""Will and Grace"" and ""Queer as Folk"" it seems rather mild by comparison. Still, that doesn't mean it isn't a good film. Yes, it is riddled with cliches and yes, it goes out of it's way to be as unoffensive as possible, yet ""Making Love"" tackles it's  subject in a fairly honest, forthright manner (especially when you consider it was filmed in 1982).Although it's nice to see Jackson on Ontkean together again (since their days on the television series ""The Rookies""), I never really bought Ontkean's performance. Even when I watch it today I feel he's too stiff and reserved, never really willing to open up and fully explore his character's conflicts and emotions. Jackson does some of her best work here (okay, so you know I'm a fan and somewhat biased but....hey, whatever). She has some genuinely touching moments, such as when she confesses her crush on her teacher to the camera (""Crepe paper is a [..] to tear""), when she talks on the phone with her father, or her final meeting with Zach. As he walks down the driveway and out of her life, the expression on her face breaks your heart. It's moments like these that make me very curious to see what Jackson could have done with the role of Joanna, the ex-wife of Dustin Hoffman's character in ""Kramer Vs. Kramer"". (She was originally offered the role but the producers of Charlie's Angels would not give her the time off). Harry Hamlin deserves kudos for taking a basically unlikable character and portraying him as such while showing the audience why he has built up this wall around himself. One reviewer noted that Zach unexplainably falls for Bart. I think it's perfectly understandable why Zach falls for him. Zach is in the middle of an identity crisis. Bart is the ONE gay man he actually knows on a personal level. It's only natural that he'd be drawn to him to learn more about himself, no matter how cocky or flippant Bart is.So yes, the film has it's flaws (as most do) but I think it holds up pretty well after all these years. I just wish the DVD had some extras darn it!!",2,Controversial then.........Tame now,1155168000,"08 10, 2006",2006,2656,"['Finally', 'Making', 'Love', 'released', 'DVD', 'questioning', 'rating', 'let', 'explain', 'ratings', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'product', 'DVD', 'not', 'film', 'give', 'DVD', '2-star', 'rating', 'simply', 'extras', 'commentary', 'track', 'making', 'featurette', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'bloopers', 'nothing', 'count', 'trailer', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'trailer', 'film', 'give', '3', '1/2', '4', 'star', 'rating', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'simply', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'it.Considered', 'controversial', 'ground', 'breaking', 'time', 'today', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'days', 'Will', 'Grace', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'rather', 'mild', 'comparison', 'Still', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'good', 'film', 'Yes', 'riddled', 'cliches', 'yes', 'way', 'be', 'as', 'unoffensive', 'possible', 'yet', 'Making', 'Love', 'subject', 'fairly', 'honest', 'forthright', 'manner', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'was', 'filmed', '1982', 'nice', 'see', 'Jackson', 'Ontkean', 'together', 'again', 'days', 'television', 'series', 'Rookies', 'never', 'really', 'bought', 'Ontkean', 'performance', 'Even', 'when', 'watch', 'today', 'feel', 'too', 'stiff', 'reserved', 'never', 'really', 'willing', 'open', 'up', 'fully', 'explore', 'character', 'conflicts', 'emotions', 'Jackson', 'best', 'work', 'here', 'okay', 'know', ""'m"", 'fan', 'somewhat', 'biased', '.hey', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'moments', 'such', 'when', 'crush', 'teacher', 'camera', 'Crepe', 'paper', '[', '..', ']', 'tear', 'when', 'phone', 'father', 'final', 'meeting', 'Zach', 'down', 'driveway', 'life', 'expression', 'face', 'heart', 'moments', 'make', 'very', 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'Jackson', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'role', 'Joanna', 'ex-wife', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'character', 'Kramer', 'Vs.', 'Kramer', 'was', 'originally', 'offered', 'role', 'producers', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'would', 'not', 'give', 'time', 'off', 'Harry', 'Hamlin', 'kudos', 'taking', 'basically', 'unlikable', 'character', 'portraying', 'such', 'showing', 'audience', 'why', 'built', 'up', 'wall', 'One', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'Zach', 'unexplainably', 'Bart', 'think', 'perfectly', 'understandable', 'why', 'Zach', 'Zach', 'middle', 'identity', 'crisis', 'Bart', 'ONE', 'gay', 'man', 'actually', 'personal', 'level', 'only', 'natural', ""'d"", 'be', 'drawn', 'learn', 'more', 'matter', 'how', 'cocky', 'flippant', 'Bart', 'is.So', 'yes', 'film', 'flaws', 'most', 'do', 'think', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'years', 'just', 'wish', 'DVD', 'had', 'extras', 'darn']",N/A

Then he meets an openly gay novelist (Harry Hamlin) and finds himself sexually attracted to him.This was released in 1982 with a huge amount of publicity.  It was the first Hollywood film from a major studio to deal with homosexuality.  Unfortunately audiences weren't ready for it.  I read about audiences storming out of the theatre when a big gay kiss came on screen. Really--what did people think they were gonna see on the screen?  I saw it in Boston MA and it was dead quiet--nobody left.  But the word of mouth was that the film was actually boring (it sort of is) and it died at the box office.The big problem with this film is that it was too timid--it tried to please everybody and ended up pretty bland.  The gay kiss was ground-breaking--but that's as far as the film went.  No nudity and the sex was suggested.  Instead we had a lot of LONG discussions between the characters--most of it had nothing to do with the main subject (I'm still at a loss to understand what that old woman that Ontkean and Jackson went to see had to do with anything).  The good acting by the entire cast held my interest.It's really pretty sad that over 20 years later Hollywood STILL won't have a gay love story like this--nobody dies and it has a happy ending.
