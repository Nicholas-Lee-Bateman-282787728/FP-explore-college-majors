I replayed some scenes, trying to figure them out.After reading the online reviews, I was confused when I read that the director said this was ""above all a critique of the workplace, which saps the creativity of workers.""I thought it was a portrait of a woman with a severe personality disorder.Although, when you think about it, her coworkers DID accept her only after she had a permanent job and a driver's license, lacking the insight to notice that something was very wrong with her.I found this film to be subtle and deceptive.  At first it seems slow-moving, and it seems to not be saying much, but actually it's saying a lot in every frame.  It's just harder to spot.  After watching it, I read the critical reveiws and watched it again, this time trying to see how much more I could spot.I have a theory about the ending.  She gets into a police car, unbidden, then the scene switches to nightfall.  She is still in the car, but the officers are not there.  Are they searching for the remains of her latest victim?  Investigating yet another crime scene?If you are intrigued by photography and acting that can make a woman beautiful in one scene and utterly monstrous in another, if you like movies that make you exercise your brain, you may just like this one.",4,Beautiful Photography,1167091200,"12 26, 2006",2006,1359,"['enjoy', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'follow', 'discernable', 'formula', 'leave', 'one', 'guessing', 'replayed', 'scenes', 'trying', 'figure', 'out.After', 'reading', 'online', 'reviews', 'was', 'confused', 'when', 'read', 'director', 'said', 'was', 'critique', 'workplace', 'creativity', 'workers', 'thought', 'was', 'portrait', 'woman', 'severe', 'personality', 'disorder.Although', 'when', 'think', 'coworkers', 'DID', 'accept', 'only', 'had', 'permanent', 'job', 'driver', 'license', 'lacking', 'insight', 'notice', 'something', 'was', 'very', 'wrong', 'her.I', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'subtle', 'deceptive', 'first', 'slow-moving', 'not', 'be', 'saying', 'much', 'actually', 'saying', 'lot', 'frame', 'just', 'harder', 'spot', 'watching', 'read', 'critical', 'reveiws', 'watched', 'again', 'time', 'trying', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'spot.I', 'have', 'theory', 'ending', 'police', 'car', 'unbidden', 'then', 'scene', 'nightfall', 'still', 'car', 'officers', 'are', 'not', 'there', 'Are', 'searching', 'remains', 'latest', 'victim', 'Investigating', 'yet', 'crime', 'scene', 'are', 'intrigued', 'photography', 'acting', 'can', 'make', 'woman', 'beautiful', 'one', 'scene', 'utterly', 'monstrous', 'like', 'movies', 'make', 'exercise', 'brain', 'may', 'just', 'like', 'one']",N/A
940296,A31ELTOVZM5JHR,B000BC8T4G,C. Rothlind,"[0, 0]","Easily one of the best films of the year, Sigrid Alnoy's debut, ironically titled ""She's one of Us"" [""Elle est des Notres""] takes us deep into the alternative reality of an outsider attempting to fit into the professional world of corporate France. A sort of existential take on office politics, though Alnoy is more broadly focused, exploring her protagonist Christine Blanc's precarious and increasingly fraught relation to reality [= other people]. A case of poorly constructed ego-boundaries and mistaken identities, the film colludes with Blanc to present dimensions of inner truth as manifest experience.One of the most masterful directing debuts I've ever seen. This poetic character study is a supremely competent, immersive-evocative meditation on the perils of personhood.

940297,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000BC8T4G,Lee Armstrong,"[4, 4]","Sasha Andress stars in this film as Christine Blanc.  She is a socially awkward, lonely person.  The silences and spaces in the film will make the pace very slow for American viewers; however, the spaces in the film serve to show how silent the life of the very lonely is.  Sasha is not the most beautiful of women, but her eyes do communicate great range from nervousness to shyness to humor and anger.  Sasha works for a temp agency headed by Patricia played by Catherine Mouchet.  The French Academy of Cinema nominated Mouchet as Best Supporting Actress for ""Ma Petite Entreprise.""  Christine invites Patricia to her home for dinner.  Christine has apparently invented a boyfriend who she claims is out of town.  The dinner goes well and results in Patricia coming by to get Christine when she has been ill.  Patricia buys matching lime green bathing suits and takes her to a pool.  Reasons why the film complicates were unclear.  Christine coughs and apparently is not a good swimmer, having visions of death when she's knocked unexpectedly into the pool.  She goes off to an empty hallway near the locker room and coughs and tries to recover.  Patricia comes to find her friend and touches her when Christine does respond to her.  Why Christine reacts violently is hard to say.  The whimpering Patricia will probably attract attention; so Christine does what any red-blooded Frenchwoman would do -- she picks up a fire extinguisher and bashes Patricia's head in.From there, Christine's life picks up considerably.  She's offered a permanent job by the Human Resources Director who only wants a little oral sex as his reward for hiring.  Christine acquires a younger boyfriend Eric who moves in with her.  Eric Caravaca who was nominated by the French Academy of Cinema for his portrayal of a disfigured WWI officer in ""La Chambre of Officiers"" plays Eric.  Christine manipulates the HR Director to give leave to one coworker who wears the same sweater as she and fire another young man who she's stared at in a mall and has now come to her firm as a temp.  While her coworker vacations in the resort at Luxor, Egypt, Eric and Christine apparently also vacation resulting in the amazing long nude scene where the camera stares at the privates of these two unmoving lovers.  Eventually Inspector Degas played by Carlo Brandt investigates the crime and Christine is repeatedly questioned by the police.I watched the film with 3 other people, none of whom understood the ending.  Here's my interpretation for those of you scratching your heads as we did.  Christine is lonely & awkward when the film begins.  Eventually, she finds her station in life.  During her vacation with the little office temp, she appears to find true joy and happiness.  My theory is that in order for her to really be free to experience these newfound positive emotions, she must atone for the murder of Patricia.  Thus, at the end of the film, she blocks a police car and climbs in, refusing to leave.  Why the officers abandon their vehicle or the car lights from within as night falls, I know not.  But that's my theory of the ending of the piece.For a first film, Siegrid Alrony has created a visually stunning film.  It is a slow-paced film filled with the silences of loneliness.

940299,A3HKP0EB69MUUA,B000BC8T4G,Patricia Bates,"[1, 2]","My take on this film is that the character of Christine has essentially sociopathic features with episodes of psychotic delusions and hallucinations. She imagines the restaurant where the police captain meets her. She sees a luxurious restaurant but it turns out to be an empty hall. She imagines her lover. She imagines she has a sort of familiarity with the waitress at the bar she visits. She purchases an entire collection of owls based on a lie to impress her boss with whom she has no real connection. She doesn't pay her apartment rental. She is not connected to reality.Christine values only the outward appearance of things. Her actions are robotic and stiff. There are no authentic emotions that drive her. There is Nobody Home, as therapists might say. She has two emotions that are true for her: Depression and Rage. She doesn't want to be depressed, so she acts out to avoid the depression and emptiness, i.e.by the murder, i.e.by sexual fantasies, i.e. engaging in spontaneous inappropriate behavior such as abandoning her car and suddenly walking through a forest. Escape from her depression and her profound emptiness is the reason she suddenly acts out (again) and goes sits in the police car: because it is novel, she has never done it before and she will feel some titillation and excitement for the moment. Even the shot of her face shows anticipation at this New Thing she is experiencing.The most amazing thing about the movie was the people around Christine. They are the real enigma. After the murder, why did they suddenly feel so inappropriately drawn to her? They couldn't praise her enough, they dragged her to their partying with them, gave her lottery tickets...why?This piece was completely illogical in the film: people simply do not continue to fawn over a person who has such an impoverished emotional range to the minutae of life's happenings. They do not feel attracted to such a person who is obviously not able to experience true pleasure and joy because they themselves would begin to feel alone. So why did they act like this? The supporting characters in the movie who ""loved"" Christine after the murder feel like an artifice to me.Fascinating camera work and lighting in this film.
