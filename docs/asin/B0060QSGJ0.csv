The Broadway Musical Production won four Tony Awards including Best Musical for 2010.  The show played on Broadway from 2009 to 2012, and is currently touring.The time is set in the 50s with Huey Calhoun, played by Chad Kimball, a white DJ, who loves the rhythm and blues sound, and he arrives against opposition, on the scene, to a black underground club to convince the black patrons that he is real and into soul music.  Huey has an air of coolness to him, shows some swagger, and is white-boy suave.  And, mainly, he  knows how to sell records,  He falls for the club owner's sister, making her own way into the music industry.  Together, they have a mission.From there, the story follows the love between a white dj and a black musician.  The theme is about race relations of the time.  There is one incidence of violence, but it is done without offending the audience.It's clear to see why this musical won the Tony Award... with plenty of fun, lively songs, robust dancing, colorful costumes, and a very good storyline.  I don't think there can be another Huey Calhoun, as the original Broadway performer, Chad Kimball was outstanding in the role.The music is pure exhilarating rock and roll.  The founding member of Bon Jovi, David Bryan was behind the musical production.  This great Broadway musical is filled with music and dance.The changing sets were very impressive, well done also.

1507964,A136MAOWGCU2C2,B0060QSGJ0,K.T. May,"[1, 3]","Today I saw the 2:00 showing of the 2010 Tony Award winner Memphis on Broadway.  I was super excited, as this was my chance to finally see Rent alum Adam Pascal perform live on stage.  I had met him years ago at the screener for the film adaptation of Rent, but I had yet to see him sing in person.  Not only did he nearly move me to tears with his powerful voice, but the rest of the cast did such a fine job that I was sure the audience would have danced right along with them if there was no seating!Memphis centers on a white disc jockey, Huey Calhoun, who has a particular affinity for ""race"" music during a time when this is obviously still a taboo subject: the 1950s.  He wanders into a club (""Delray's"") which is owned by the brother of Felicia, who sings at the club and instantly charms Huey.  He promises to get her on the radio one day if a local radio station will give him a job.  ""If I get on the radio, you'll get on the radio.""  After being fired for selling ""race"" music records like hot cakes at his department store job, Huey lands a job as a DJ where his success continues as he plays ""race"" music over the local radio.  As Huey's success grows, so does Felicia's.  She finds herself both falling for Huey and embarking on his endeavors, despite the protests of Huey's prejudicial mother and the horrific violence Huey and Felicia ultimately endure.Huey eventually lands a variety show starring all black dancers.  He is offered the chance to break out of Memphis, Tennessee and into the big leagues if he changes his cast to all white dancers.  Simultaneously, Felicia desperately wants to move up north to New York and begs Huey to come with her.  She desires freedom from the dangers of racism that came with her relationship with Huey, as well as that of simply living everyday life.  Huey can't imagine ever leaving Memphis, as it is his home and a part of who he is.Memphis is, at times, like one large gospel revival; it encourages the audience to shout ""Hallelujah!"".  As the doo-wop of the 50's gives way to rock 'n' roll over the course of the play, the musical tone noticeably varies to give way to more of a bluesy and rockabilly feel.  As Felicia remarks at one point, ""rock 'n' roll is just Negro blues speeded up!""  That's the beauty of Memphis.  It comingles rock 'n' roll and the blues in the same way that it comingles people of differing races.  We are all the same, just slightly different.Adam Pascal was as enjoyable as I always knew he would be, particularly during his solo ""Memphis Lives in Me"".  He hit the high notes with such gusto that I believe I forgot to breathe for a second.  He played Huey Calhoun with a convincingly simple mind and an impeccable accent.  I am thrilled that I finally got to see him on the Broadway stage.Montego Glover was phenomenal as Felicia and hers and the rest of the company's costumes were simply gorgeous.  My two favorites in particular were her red satin pumps and her sparkly, Barbie-like gown that was simply breath-taking.  Glover also brings a naivety to her role that makes your heart break for her.  I strongly suggest seeing her while she is still with the company, as both she and Pascal intend on leaving the show in the fall of 2012.  Glover originated the role and no replacement is yet lined up.J. Bernard Calloway was my third favorite actor in his role as Delray.  He has some of the best lines and his delivery of certain lines roused plenty of laughs from the audience.  James Monroe Iglehart was an instant favorite as Bobby, who reminded me of Amos from Chicago in that he was the underdog for which everyone rooted and we all felt similar pangs of happiness to see him succeed and break out of his shell.Memphis is a bluesy production with an old-timey feel that provides all three elements of a successful Broadway production: fantastic music, awe-inspiring costumes (and costume changes!) and a solid story.  If you were alive during the 1950s, I recommend this highly, as you will probably gain an extra layer of enjoyment from having experienced first-hand the history that fostered this production.  For the rest of us, I recommend it for its hilarity, rollicking numbers and visuals.  I was also surprised to learn that the keyboardist for New Jersey's own rock legends Bon Jovi, David Bryan, co-wrote the score!  You will leave the theater with a positive mind and a song on your lips.For me, seeing Memphis was like flipping through channels, landing on a program I wouldn't normally watch and feeling rewarded for putting down the remote.",4,Hockadoo!,1336176000,"05 5, 2012",2012,4552,"['Today', 'saw', '2:00', 'showing', '2010', 'Tony', 'Award', 'winner', 'Memphis', 'Broadway', 'was', 'super', 'excited', 'was', 'chance', 'finally', 'see', 'Rent', 'alum', 'Adam', 'Pascal', 'perform', 'live', 'stage', 'had', 'met', 'years', 'ago', 'screener', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Rent', 'had', 'yet', 'see', 'sing', 'person', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'nearly', 'move', 'tears', 'powerful', 'voice', 'rest', 'cast', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'was', 'sure', 'audience', 'would', 'have', 'danced', 'right', 'was', 'seating', 'Memphis', 'centers', 'white', 'disc', 'jockey', 'Huey', 'Calhoun', 'who', 'particular', 'affinity', 'race', 'music', 'time', 'when', 'obviously', 'still', 'taboo', 'subject', '1950s', 'club', 'Delray', 'owned', 'brother', 'Felicia', 'who', 'club', 'instantly', 'charms', 'Huey', 'get', 'radio', 'one', 'day', 'local', 'radio', 'station', 'will', 'give', 'job', 'get', 'radio', ""'ll"", 'get', 'radio', 'being', 'fired', 'selling', 'race', 'music', 'records', 'hot', 'cakes', 'department', 'store', 'job', 'Huey', 'job', 'DJ', 'where', 'success', 'race', 'music', 'local', 'radio', 'Huey', 'success', 'grows', 'so', 'Felicia', 'falling', 'Huey', 'embarking', 'endeavors', 'protests', 'Huey', 'prejudicial', 'mother', 'horrific', 'violence', 'Huey', 'Felicia', 'ultimately', 'eventually', 'variety', 'show', 'starring', 'black', 'dancers', 'offered', 'chance', 'break', 'Memphis', 'Tennessee', 'big', 'leagues', 'cast', 'white', 'dancers', 'Simultaneously', 'Felicia', 'desperately', 'move', 'up', 'north', 'New', 'York', 'begs', 'Huey', 'come', 'freedom', 'dangers', 'racism', 'came', 'relationship', 'Huey', 'as', 'well', 'simply', 'living', 'everyday', 'life', 'Huey', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'ever', 'leaving', 'Memphis', 'home', 'part', 'who', 'times', 'one', 'large', 'gospel', 'revival', 'audience', 'shout', 'Hallelujah', 'doo-wop', '50', 'way', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'course', 'play', 'musical', 'tone', 'noticeably', 'give', 'way', 'more', 'bluesy', 'rockabilly', 'feel', 'Felicia', 'remarks', 'one', 'point', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'just', 'Negro', 'blues', 'speeded', 'up', 'beauty', 'Memphis', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'blues', 'same', 'way', 'people', 'differing', 'races', 'are', 'same', 'just', 'slightly', 'different.Adam', 'Pascal', 'was', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'always', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'particularly', 'solo', 'Memphis', 'Me', 'hit', 'high', 'notes', 'such', 'gusto', 'believe', 'forgot', 'breathe', 'second', 'played', 'Huey', 'Calhoun', 'convincingly', 'simple', 'mind', 'impeccable', 'accent', 'am', 'thrilled', 'finally', 'got', 'see', 'Broadway', 'stage.Montego', 'Glover', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'Felicia', 'hers', 'rest', 'company', 'costumes', 'were', 'simply', 'gorgeous', 'two', 'favorites', 'particular', 'were', 'red', 'satin', 'pumps', 'sparkly', 'Barbie-like', 'gown', 'was', 'simply', 'breath-taking', 'Glover', 'also', 'naivety', 'role', 'heart', 'break', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'seeing', 'still', 'company', 'Pascal', 'intend', 'leaving', 'show', 'fall', '2012', 'originated', 'role', 'replacement', 'yet', 'lined', 'up.J', 'Bernard', 'Calloway', 'was', 'third', 'favorite', 'actor', 'role', 'Delray', 'best', 'lines', 'delivery', 'certain', 'lines', 'roused', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'audience', 'James', 'Monroe', 'Iglehart', 'was', 'instant', 'favorite', 'Bobby', 'who', 'reminded', 'Amos', 'Chicago', 'was', 'underdog', 'everyone', 'rooted', 'felt', 'similar', 'pangs', 'happiness', 'see', 'succeed', 'break', 'shell.Memphis', 'bluesy', 'production', 'old-timey', 'feel', 'three', 'elements', 'successful', 'Broadway', 'production', 'fantastic', 'music', 'awe-inspiring', 'costumes', 'costume', 'changes', 'solid', 'story', 'were', 'alive', '1950s', 'recommend', 'highly', 'will', 'probably', 'gain', 'extra', 'layer', 'enjoyment', 'having', 'experienced', 'first-hand', 'history', 'fostered', 'production', 'rest', 'recommend', 'hilarity', 'rollicking', 'numbers', 'visuals', 'was', 'also', 'surprised', 'learn', 'keyboardist', 'New', 'Jersey', 'own', 'rock', 'legends', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'David', 'Bryan', 'co-wrote', 'score', 'will', 'leave', 'theater', 'positive', 'mind', 'song', 'lips.For', 'seeing', 'Memphis', 'was', 'flipping', 'channels', 'landing', 'program', 'would', ""n't"", 'normally', 'watch', 'feeling', 'rewarded', 'putting', 'down', 'remote']",Memphis: The Original Broadway Production
1507965,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B0060QSGJ0,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[2, 2]","Theatre Review #43: "" Memphis ""By Lorenzo M.Yes, I understand why this production received the ""2010 Best Musical of the Year Tony Award' - it was energetic, it was upbeat, it was passionate, it was colorful and it was fun! This current production at the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood of Memphis - contains some of the most amazing vocal talent I have ever seen on a live stage.Director Christopher Ashley (Director of the Broadway revival of The Rocky Horror Picture Show and the first Broadways run of Xanadu) along with writers David Bryan (music and lyrics) and Joe DiPietro (lyrics and book) made a toe-tapping, hand-slapping, energetic musical based loosely on a real Memphis disc jockey Dewey Phillips who is one of the first white DJ's to play black music in the 1950's.First I want to say - still not completely gone even today - racial discrimination was mean, sometimes brutal and often slow to change. This play makes a real issue very clear that there is always an upside to accepting people for who they are and what they believe in. Including love itself - and which love knows no boundaries, no limits and especially knows no skin color of any race.The talent abounds in this entire production and let me start with Bryan Fenkart, playing Huey - the man who changed the `sound' of radio by introducing the white community to the `Soul' of Rhythm and Blues (and the heart of Rock'N'Roll!)! His spot-on southern accent, superb timing and acting chops and especially his vocal talents spark a musical explosion of emotions toward his love for a black woman and the music that moves his very own soul. He amazingly delivers the hysterically written song ""Hello, My Name Is Huey""- and sets the tone of his whole mission. But, his most amazing solo number is ""Memphis Lives In Me"" - a heart-wrenching cry of his inner soul.His girlfriend Felicia, played by the beautiful Felecia Boswell, is sassy, smart and full of passion with her desire to move up and out of the slums of Memphis and pursue a musical career. Ms. Boswell performance is amazingly sharp and ever-present with passion - however her vocal talents will amaze you. She can sing with power and range and duration that I have not seen on stage live in a long time. She shines with her song ""Colored Woman"".Bryan and Felecia, when singing together, have amazing vocal harmony and timing with their combined musical numbers like ""Ain't Nothing But A Kiss"", ""Make Me Stronger"" and ""Love Will Stand"". They made the audience roar with applause.Another standout and show-stopping performance came from Huey's `Mama' - played by the amazingly talented and vocally stunning actress/singer Julie Johnson. She literally stops the show to a thunderous applause with her musical number ""Change Don't Come Easy"". Not only can she sing, harmonize and scat like no one I've ever heard before, but she has comic timing and strong witty deliveries that make you cheer for her character throughout the production.All of the supporting cast had amazing vocal talents, from the deep vocal styling's of Quentin Earl Darrington playing Felicia's brother to the large Janitor with the amazing song and dance moves played by the talented Will Mann - to the amazingly charming and funny station manager Mr. Simmons played hysterically by William Perry.The rest of the ensemble keeps the energy high with their vocal talents and energetic dance moves which were designed by the choreographer Sergio Trujillo who created some of the most entertaining and original steps for this time-sensitive play.Some of the most amazing numbers include, ""Underground"", ""The Music of My Soul"", ""Radio"", ""Stand Up"", ""Tear Down The House' and the showing stopping finale of ""Steal Your Rock'N'Roll"".A special note to the Scenic Design by David Gallo and Lighting Design of Howell Binkly who created a set and look that was not only candy for the eye but simplistic and yet functional to make us believe in this story and characters. It included live video feeds, color set pieces and a stage that moved in and out to create locations - musically - in seconds. Special note as well to the time-accurate details and colorful costuming done by Paul Tazewell too!This musical is MUST-SEE. Nominated for nine Tony Awards and winner of four - including Best Musical, Best Book, Best Orchestration and Best Score - this is a really great show, with an extremely talented cast and musicians. It's worth the price of the ticket to see the performances of Bryan, Felicia and especially Julie and it's exactly a production like this that reminds me why I really love Musicals so much!
