728899,A1YZMGEC9ELI4L,B00007GZRP,"A.P. Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[0, 0]","3.5 out of 5When a school teacher is accidentally struck by a strange, green glowing meteor, he is endowed with superpowers. Just in the nick of time, too, because a street gang called the Golden Lords have terrorized his neighborhood. Now, with the help of super abilities from the green shimmering rock, he's able to take a stand for his neighborhood and what he believes in.I saw this movie when I was a kid. I remember seeing it at the local Pick-A-Flick and renting it. What I got was a sincere, heart-warming tale about a down-and-out neighborhood struggling to keep going while crime and violence ravage its streets. Enter Jefferson Reed (Robert Townsend), a well-meaning and kind man who happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. Once the meteor gives him superpowers, he takes on the gangs and, at the behest of his own parents, also takes on the identity of Meteor Man and becomes the neighborhood's champion.While not a serious superhero movie--there's plenty of humor to go around--The Meteor Man is not all-out goofy like Blankman, but instead takes a kind of tongue-and-cheek approach to the genre while also telling a story about strength in numbers, standing up for yourself, and simply saying no to being a passive observer of evil.This flick is also--and I really don't know how to phrase it so excuse me--a ""black"" movie, with a pretty much all black cast. I loved that part of it and there were so many recognizable actors: Bill Cosby, James Earle Jones, Don Cheadle, Sinbad and more. It's strange because I don't get that sense of community and warmth from watching flicks with all white casts. Anyway, that's just an aside.The Meteor Man, also written and directed by Robert Townsend and not just starring him as the titular character, was done at a time before superheroes on the screen were all dark and serious, where there had to be non-stop action and all kinds of special effects and fancy costumes. And you know what? It totally worked.This movie as a memorable one because of the messages and themes running through it and I advise it to be on the serious superhero collector's movie shelf.",4,"Memorable, with Strong Themes of Standing Up for Yourself",1370995200,"06 12, 2013",2013,2130,"['3.5', '5When', 'school', 'teacher', 'accidentally', 'struck', 'strange', 'green', 'glowing', 'meteor', 'endowed', 'superpowers', 'Just', 'nick', 'time', 'too', 'street', 'gang', 'called', 'Golden', 'Lords', 'have', 'terrorized', 'neighborhood', 'Now', 'help', 'super', 'abilities', 'green', 'shimmering', 'rock', 'able', 'take', 'stand', 'neighborhood', 'what', 'in.I', 'saw', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'remember', 'seeing', 'local', 'Pick-A-Flick', 'renting', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'sincere', 'heart-warming', 'tale', 'down-and-out', 'neighborhood', 'struggling', 'keep', 'going', 'crime', 'violence', 'ravage', 'streets', 'Enter', 'Jefferson', 'Reed', 'Robert', 'Townsend', 'well-meaning', 'kind', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'Once', 'meteor', 'superpowers', 'gangs', 'behest', 'own', 'parents', 'also', 'identity', 'Meteor', 'Man', 'neighborhood', 'champion.While', 'not', 'serious', 'superhero', 'movie', 'plenty', 'humor', 'go', 'around', 'Meteor', 'Man', 'not', 'all-out', 'goofy', 'Blankman', 'instead', 'kind', 'tongue-and-cheek', 'approach', 'genre', 'also', 'telling', 'story', 'strength', 'numbers', 'standing', 'up', 'simply', 'saying', 'being', 'passive', 'observer', 'evil.This', 'flick', 'also', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'phrase', 'so', 'black', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'black', 'cast', 'loved', 'part', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'recognizable', 'actors', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'James', 'Earle', 'Jones', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Sinbad', 'more', 'strange', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'community', 'warmth', 'watching', 'flicks', 'white', 'casts', 'Anyway', 'just', 'aside.The', 'Meteor', 'Man', 'also', 'written', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Townsend', 'not', 'just', 'starring', 'titular', 'character', 'was', 'done', 'time', 'superheroes', 'screen', 'were', 'dark', 'serious', 'where', 'there', 'had', 'be', 'non-stop', 'action', 'kinds', 'special', 'effects', 'fancy', 'costumes', 'know', 'what', 'totally', 'worked.This', 'movie', 'memorable', 'one', 'messages', 'themes', 'running', 'advise', 'be', 'serious', 'superhero', 'collector', 'movie', 'shelf']",N/A

728906,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B00007GZRP,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[3, 11]","Robert Townsend's the Meteor Man was supposed to be a satire of Comic books and Superheroes. Unfortunately, it's a poor copy of the Batman TV show of the 60's without any of the humor. Townsend makes a ton of mistakes here and all of them make the movie one of the worst you'll ever see.Meteor Man could have been a lot of fun to watch; a black superhero satire film is really an interesting premise. While Townsend is very good at satire he doesn't know that the method of acting in this type of satire is actually ""Camp."" In order to make fun of Comic books and Superheroes you must understand the mechanics of comedy and what style works best to tell the jokes in. Superheroes are already farfetched and the only way to poke fun at them in their world is for the characters to take themselves seriously. Unfortunately, Townsend tells to cast to take their roles for a joke and that's a big mistake. ""Camp"" only works when the actors play their roles seriously. The serious performances working in tandem with the satiric jokes pokes fun at the ridiculousness of the situations the hero involves himself in as opposed to how it's seen in the real world and that's what makes it funny. When the actors are aware of the joke we can't laugh with them or at them. Contrast MM to the Batman TV show, Wild Wild West, or Sam Raimi's Hercules, Xena, or even the Tick TV series. In each of these shows the actors take their roles so seriously that we laugh at how absurd the situations are as opposed to the real world. We know about the jokes that the characters don't.Townsend's second mistake was casting big name stars in the film. To make Camp work you need to cast unknown actors in the roles so they blend into the characters. People Like Bill Cosby, Luther Vandross and James Earl Jones stand out like sore thumbs in this film and look so ridiculous that we can't laugh at the jokes they tell. The use of then rapper Big Daddy Kane, commedian Sinbad and the group Another Bad creation wearing bad blond fades just look cartoonish. Smaller actors taking their roles seriously would have made this work.Townsend's third and final mistake in this film was the script. It's not serious. It makes comic books look cartoonish. On top of that it's preachy and shallow; it's clear that he didn't research comic books or superheroes at all before writing it. The origin and the powers of the meteor man come together so poorly that we can't suspend our disbelief at his superhuman abilities. A meteor slamming into a man would kill him, not give him powers. Him toching a meteor rock and getting powers would make sense. On top of that his powers are inconsistent. Flight and Super Strength make sense but the ability to read any book by touching it had me scratching my head.I don't see this film as a creative failure for Robert Townsend. I'm glad he tried to do something different and original with a Black film. Meteor Man had the potential to be something great, however, Townsend didn't do the necessary research to make this type of comedy work. He might have watched the old Batman show for reference, but didn't take the time to dissect the jokes to understand what made them funny like he did in his great first film Hollywood Shuffle. I'm hoping someone tries another film like this because I think someone who understands the style of humor that camp is could make a truly great film.",2,Good ideas. poor execution.

728907,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B00007GZRP,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[1, 3]","Strange movie. I find it both incredibly stupid and yet entertaining. I don't mean stupid in a campy fun way. I mean ""What lame brained idiot wrote this?!?"" kind of stupid. If it weren't for such a large array of a very talented all-star cast this movie would have no hope whatsoever. I do admit, as stupid Meteor Man was I actually enjoyed some parts of it very much.Character development is a major crapfest in this movie. Our hero in my opinion takes way too long to figure out what he has to do and ends up dragging the movie because of it. The villains are major stupids in their entire 'coolness' splendor. What's the deal with the gold Slinky? Pretty much all the characters are pretty one-dimensional and simple minded. That's not to say the acting was the same way. As a matter of fact the acting was superb all things considered. With such big names like Rob Townsend, Bill Cosby, James Earl Jones, Sinbad, and whole mess of others I'm not surprised the acting came up aces. As a matter of fact that's probably the only thing that saved this movie.Being a superhero movie the special effects are pretty standard for things like flying, laser eyes and of course a crashing meteor (that seems to home in on our hero). In other words the special effects are functional. The things to look for are a few scenes that do shine above all the crap in the rest of the movie. The final fight scene, by the way, is not one of them. For one it's painfully long. I was begging for the final scene to be over it was taking so long. Plus, like much of the writing, it ends up being very, very stupid.If only a condensed version of this movie was made to squeeze out the lame parts and leave in the good stuff I can recommend it. As it stands you would have to sit through some dumb scenes to get to the good stuff. If you have nothing better to do then give The Meteor Man a chance.
