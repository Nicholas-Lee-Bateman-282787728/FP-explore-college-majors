1662279,A28Z84QTQ3ZLF3,B00DXP7L88,a movie fan,"[10, 22]","Each season of Dexter followed a formula: Dexter has a foil who teaches him an important lesson, and a victim (who may or may not survive) who drives that lesson home. In season: (1) Brian shows the necessity of having a code, at Deb's expense; (2) Lila shows the evil of thrill killing, at Doakes' expense; (3) Prado shows that you can't teach the code, at Ellen's expense; (4) Mitchell shows that you can't pretend to be normal forever, at Rita's expense; (5) Chase shows that you can't have partners, at Lumen's  expense; (6) Marshall shows that religion offers no moral alternative, at Harrison's expense; (7) Isaak teaches him that home is where you can be yourself, at Hannah's expense. The beauty of season 8 is its misdirection. It appears that Dr. Vogel is there to show that you can't reform a psychopath, although we know by now that Dexter really isn't one. But Vogel isn't the real foil, who stays hidden for much of the season, and teaches a similar but more compelling lesson: you can't change your ways, at Deb's expense, which brings us full circle and explains the ending. All the lessons above are variations on a theme, which is driven home only in season 8, and made even more poignant by  maybe the show's best episode, Argentina, in season 7, which sets up much of season 8.

I wanted to see Deb and Angel and Joey and Masuka, and especially Dexter.  Michael C Hall is one intense man, and I loved his interpretation of Dex.  Jennifer Carpenter is an extraordinary actress, in my opinion, and made Deb better than she was written.However, as I watched Dexter slowly ooze from a hard-core badass into a 14 year old girl (apologies, girls) with a huge crush, I could only stare in horror and repeat the same phrase, ""What is he doing??? WHY IS HE TALKING SO MUCH?"" I'm surprised we didn't see him doodling hearts and writing bad love poetry as he struggled to muster up the energy to find, much less kill, the bad guy.  ""I don't waaaaannnnaaaa!"" he whines, so instead he calls Deb to take care of it for him.  Ugh.I was actually glad to see Hannah... mistakenly thinking that NOW we were getting somewhere!  Imagine holding a brightly colored, shiny balloon.  Let it go and watch as the escaping air propels it to its demise, and there we have the Hannah story line.  She's such a devious vixen!  So... not even a wig, or a dopey hat to disguise her when she's a hunted fugitive? Not even one little plot twist to make her interesting?  Nope.  Instead, she's wasted on cooking scenes and ingenue-ish love scenes. Bleah.Oliver Saxon, played brilliantly by Darri Ingolfsson, was a wasted opportunity. This character had the potential to be THE most insidious villain of the series, the biggest challenge to Dexter ever, the most prolific killer and plot enhancer of the past 8 years.  Instead, he went from highly intelligent psychopath to bumbling oaf.  His ending was an insult to oafs everywhere.  Hello, flat balloon.  *sigh*The last 2 minutes (or so) of the very last ""Dexter"" made me wonder: Did the writers think that they were doing their viewers a favor by showing that?  Because, just for the record, I could have lived without it.  Seriously.I could go on.  In fact, I kind of *want* to go on but I won't.

1662285,APOJGLIZTNQ3K,B00DXP7L88,Apollo,"[6, 12]","CONTAINS SPOILERS SO PLEASE WATCH OUTWe wrote our first Dexter review at the end of S7 and threw up some possible story points for S8 (pretty unsuccessfully!).  There seems to be alot of early negative reviews here, relating to the season in general, but particularly with the ending and although we were disappointed too the 1 & 2 star ratings are way to harsh.After writing the S7 review we had hoped that the final season would eschew the standard Dexter formula and NOT introduce new characters and provide yet another serial/master killer.  The reason being that all S8 had to do was start at precisely where S7 ended and should have simply focused on Angel, sharply changing his mind about retiring, and with the full resources of Miami Metro behind him, aggressively investigate the murder of Maria (I mean, is there a fan out there who really did not want to see more of the immediate aftermath of Maria's murder..........particularly when Dexter & Deb went back to the party....and then the hours, days and weeks after!?).  Ultimately, the entire season would have revolved around the unit slowly piecing together evidence that points to Dexter being the killer (hell, you even had Angel find the warrants Maria had obtained for Dexters/Debs phone records!!).  The story turns/developments that could have been done would have been more than enough to fully flesh out the season without the unecessary tangents that this final season took.  In addition, it could have included and given more screen time to the main supporting characters (eg. Vince would have been pivotal in forensically identifying his 'hero' as the 'villain' & Quinn would have been divided by his affection for Deb).  There was alot to work with here!With the murder of Maria the final season was always going to be downbeat but even though we thought it would happen the death of Deb was still heartbreaking (particularly when the impression was that she might be allowed to survive.......but it appears the makers did want her, and Dexter, to pay the ultimate price for their actions).With a show that lasted 8 seasons, with fans investing so much time and caring for such appealing characters, the show should not have ended with so much ambiguity and so many loose ends and unanswered questions (to the point that the last few scenes seemed like an 11th hour tack on).  Not that we want to be spoon-fed but a certain amount of definitive closure should have been allowed for.Despite its failings S8 is still very good but contrary to the filmakers apparent endgame this is a show that demanded, and we hope most fans would agree and have accepted (and really wanted), a 'happy' ending.......with Dexter, Deb & Harrison making an escape when it was clear Miami Metro was on to them (how great would it have been to see the reactions of Angel, et al, once the evidence slowly revealed the truth about their great friend Dexter!?).Thanks once more to everyone involved with this marvellous programme that we will almost certainly never see its like again......but we will also kind of hate you because, at the moment, the first thing we think of when we now think of Dexter is that Deb dies.....hopefully that will fade in time.PS: a few more days have passed since we saw the final episode and the ending has gotten less and less acceptable.....to the point that our rating has reduced to 3.5 stars.

I think it would be doubly wrong to use jumping the shark to describe the final season of HBO's ""Dexter"" because the verb ""jump"" implies a level of energy and commitment that is completely absent here. Everyone involved in the series seems to have just given up caring or trying -- for whatever reasons there's no depth, no humor, no subtlety or vigor left.

I didn't mind all the emotional turmoil (in place of action) in some of the intermediate episodes because I get that the writers had quite a lot of work to do in order to take Dexter from 'Dexter' to 'Pathetic Wuss.' But in the end, they seem to run out of time and have their characters do unmotivated, unrealistic, or otherwise unbelievable things. As an example, I just don't see Deb being quite as incompetent as portrayed: we caught this really bad serial killer, I know, let's leave him all by himself for a while and see what happens! Right. And Dexter's actions at the end are just stupid. I don't buy the final &#34;boat trip&#34; because Dexter didn't even believe in funerals and there's no way he would take those chances to accomplish something relatively meaningless (to him). The writerd can say &#34;oh, but we made him change&#34; in this series but after a while, one just has to wonder &#34;why.&#34; If you take Dexter and turn him into &#34;non-Dexter,&#34; who the heck cares what happens to him.

I am a diehard Dexter fan, so I finally decided I had to see for myself.  The season itself isn't too bad, although it definitely isn't one of the best either.  The problem is that they focused A LOT on Deb and it kind of took away from the normal build up to catching &#34;the killer.&#34;  It was a bit disappointing to see such a strong character go through such a ROUGH time after all the show has taken her through, but I guess they want you to feel like she reached her breaking point.Again, the season itself isn't all that bad, just not one of the best that this otherwise GREAT show has put together.  The problem is the final episode.  I won't ruin it for anybody (although by now you have probably already heard about it) the final episode is probably the WORST I have EVER seen.  It answers questions for you, so it doesn't leave you in suspense like The Soprano's did, but it is like writers JUST released that was the LAST episode and hastily put something together!!!

I've seen every one of the ninety-six episodes of the show (some of them several times, my personal favorite being episode #84) and I don't think it's fair to say that Season 8 was weak. It wasn't as strong as Seasons 1-4 or as Season 7 but we were introduced to some interesting, compelling characters (Dr. Vogel, for example) and to unexpected turns in the story. For me, Season 8 started falling appart in episode 94: The conclusion of the show was really disappointing. When I finished watching the last episode I realized that maybe it's just too hard to end a remarkable show with a bang. Look what happened at the conclusion of ""Seinfeld"" back in 1998. I have been imagining different scenarios for the ending of ""Dexter"" and I haven't been able to come up with one that I would have found completely satisfying (I always envisioned Dexter being killed on the last episode.)

BB is perhaps the best tv show bar none.  if i were to write tv reviews comparing every one to BB, nothing would probably get over 4 stars again. so this review in no way is saying i like this show as much as BB.  however, DEXTER has held up for me personally over the past seasons.  I've always looked forward to it and enjoyed it. i am even a huger fan of the novels but it is a doomed prospect comparing novels with visual media.  they are apples and oranges. my original review follows.there are some viewers of dexter who have been hugely disappointed with some seasons of this show,  i have not. i also read the novels, which are very different from the show.  they are much more comic. i also have no problem with the novels.  so if you are someone who has been very up and down with dexter, i may not be the reviewer for you.in my opinion, this is overall a satisfying conclusion to the Dexter series.  Front and center throughout this last season are Dexter, Deb, the ghost of Harry, their father, AND the shrink who oversaw Harry's development of the code, played by Charlotte Rampling.  She treats both Dexter and Deb!As we open, Deb is an absolute mess from having killed LaGuarda at the conclusion of last season. she has quit the force, is drinking and taking drugs, is working free lance for an investigative firm, etc.,  Dexter is desperate to fix her but of course he is the source of her problem and she can now barely stand the sight of him.  with this set up we are off and running while also tying up the supporting characters on the series, like Vince, Angel and others.the success of this show largely depends on the acting jobs of michael c. hall and jennifer carpenter as dexter and deb.  if they were in any way weak, the entire series would flounder.  it is good Hall recovered from his bout with cancer as i can't see anyone else taking over the Dexter role from him.some are upset at how this show concludes.  it would not fit the novels at all as the novels are comedic whereas the tv show has always been solely dramatic.  the show is also more morally oriented than the novels. this often happens in tv and film adaptations of novels, unfortunately. so this is a highly moral conclusion to the Dexter story. perhaps someday the Dexter series will be remade to fit with its novels. if so, the actor would have to be highly comedic, which i doubt describes michael c. hall as dexter.  with the dexter which was reinvented for the tv screen, he did the best job he possibly could.",5,i have liked it all along so ending is fine too,1378339200,"09 5, 2013",2013,2660,"['clarification', 'update', 'finishing', 'up', 'show', 'also', 'am', 'finishing', 'up', 'BREAKING', 'BAD', 'i', 'had', 'decide', 'compare', 'show', 'one', 'BB', 'perhaps', 'best', 'tv', 'show', 'bar', 'none', 'i', 'were', 'write', 'tv', 'reviews', 'comparing', 'one', 'BB', 'nothing', 'would', 'probably', 'get', '4', 'stars', 'again', 'review', 'way', 'saying', 'i', 'show', 'as', 'much', 'BB', 'however', 'DEXTER', 'held', 'up', 'personally', 'past', 'seasons', ""'ve"", 'always', 'looked', 'forward', 'enjoyed', 'i', 'am', 'even', 'huger', 'fan', 'novels', 'doomed', 'prospect', 'comparing', 'novels', 'visual', 'media', 'are', 'apples', 'oranges', 'original', 'review', 'are', 'viewers', 'dexter', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'hugely', 'disappointed', 'seasons', 'show', 'i', 'have', 'not', 'i', 'also', 'read', 'novels', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'show', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'comic', 'i', 'also', 'have', 'problem', 'novels', 'so', 'are', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'very', 'up', 'down', 'dexter', 'i', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'reviewer', 'you.in', 'opinion', 'overall', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'Dexter', 'series', 'Front', 'center', 'last', 'season', 'are', 'Dexter', 'Deb', 'ghost', 'Harry', 'father', 'shrink', 'who', 'oversaw', 'Harry', 'development', 'code', 'played', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'Dexter', 'Deb', 'open', 'Deb', 'absolute', 'mess', 'having', 'killed', 'LaGuarda', 'conclusion', 'last', 'season', 'quit', 'force', 'drinking', 'taking', 'drugs', 'working', 'free', 'lance', 'investigative', 'firm', 'etc.', 'Dexter', 'desperate', 'fix', 'course', 'source', 'problem', 'can', 'now', 'barely', 'stand', 'sight', 'set', 'up', 'are', 'off', 'running', 'while', 'also', 'tying', 'up', 'supporting', 'characters', 'series', 'Vince', 'Angel', 'others.the', 'success', 'show', 'largely', 'acting', 'jobs', 'michael', 'c.', 'hall', 'jennifer', 'carpenter', 'dexter', 'deb', 'were', 'way', 'weak', 'entire', 'series', 'would', 'flounder', 'good', 'Hall', 'recovered', 'bout', 'cancer', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'anyone', 'else', 'taking', 'over', 'Dexter', 'role', 'him.some', 'are', 'upset', 'how', 'show', 'would', 'not', 'fit', 'novels', 'novels', 'are', 'comedic', 'tv', 'show', 'always', 'been', 'solely', 'dramatic', 'show', 'also', 'more', 'morally', 'oriented', 'novels', 'often', 'tv', 'film', 'adaptations', 'novels', 'unfortunately', 'highly', 'moral', 'conclusion', 'Dexter', 'story', 'perhaps', 'Dexter', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'remade', 'fit', 'novels', 'so', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'highly', 'comedic', 'i', 'doubt', 'describes', 'michael', 'c.', 'hall', 'dexter', 'dexter', 'was', 'reinvented', 'tv', 'screen', 'did', 'best', 'job', 'possibly', 'could']",Dexter: The Complete Final Season

Rossi,"[38, 70]","I am not sure what show the negative reviewers have been watching this season, but the final season of Dexter is nothing short of brilliant.Why end Dexter the way they did? Read on:The story of Dexter and what makes it so compelling is the journey he has been on. For eight incredible seasons we have witnessed him battle with his 'dark passenger' and watched as the dark passenger's grip weakened over time as Dexter needed less of the justice of the kills Harry and Evelyn built into Dexter as a self regulating 'code' system.When Dexter finally lost that all important last person he cared about (and WOW was that a tearjerker of a scene), going on with a life like everyone else's was no longer an option. Dexter now realized it was NEVER an option. No matter how much he wanted that new life with Hannah and Harrison in Argentina, it was simply impossible now that he had to come to grips with all the people close to him who died because of who he is.Dexter knows that even suicide can never be payment enough for the debt of him being who he is. When Dexter stares into the camera that final time, the absolute emptiness of a soul dead, a being emptied, his life and total existence ended is so much more powerful than anything else they could have come up with. It's now clear that even in spite of his living in the physical sense, he is dead in every way. He cannot have a life. Any life, even as the Dexter we knew before his journey of discovery led him to his ultimate sad fate. Now, if that isn't a proper ending for Dexter, I don't know what is. Saying goodbye to a tv character has never been so gut-wrenchingly sad.In many ways it's justice that some, though they still rooted for him, hoped for and it's a proper philosophical end for him. It was a struggle the whole way, you just knew it wasn't going to be a picture perfect happy ending, and it certainly wasn't going to be a stereotypical Hollywood style ending with his being discovered and brought to justice or killed by those involved with the discovery. The team of writers and producers and everyone involved deserves a high level of praise and respect for everything they have done throughout the series, and yes, that includes the finale. Dexter may very well be the greatest series ever. It opened up a world of emotion for a dark character no one could imagine possible before.

1662317,A1ERUWNYZ93NRR,B00DXP7L88,"Della Van Hise ""Quantum Shaman, Eye Scry Publ...","[28, 39]","While I would agree with some of the reviewers who said the writing was lacking in this final season, I have to say I thought the series ended as well as it could, given the circumstances set up in the previous season.MAJOR SPOILER ALERT - if you haven't watched the final season, you may not want to read any further.  Fair warning...I should say that I watched the final season as a whole - when the DVDs were released. Hadn't seen any of the aired episodes, so from my perspective, the final season was more like a long movie watched over a period of a week instead of months. With that said, I did have some (relatively minor) issues in the first 3 episodes of this season, with Deb having one meltdown after another.  Granted, she had good reason - but I felt some of that time could have been better spent developing other characters and expanding the plot.  I also felt the addition of Misuka's daughter was extraneous, and came at a time when the viewer would have been better served by a more intensive storyline of Dexter actually QUESTIONING the code.The psychiatrist, played by Charlotte Rampling, was an interesting twist.  The viewer was never really sure what her agenda might be - and I, for one, appreciated that approach, as compared to the shows that draw a fine line between dark and light, good guys & bad guys. Dr. Evelyn Vogel was an enigma - one never knew if she was Florence Nightengale or Dr. Lechtor - her ambiguous portrayal of the character kept me in suspense, and added an even darker element to Dexter's past - he finally met his maker, and didn't know whether to embrace her or kill her... undoubtedly a problem most humans face when coming face to face with their creator.Personally, I never cared for the character of Hannah, although I can see why she was reintroduced into the final season.  Harrison needed someone, and though I might have preferred some other solution, Hannah was probably a more suitable ""match"" for Dexter than any of his other romantic interests (including Rita).In the big picture, I felt the real ""flaw"" with the final season was that it seemed rushed and could have benefited from another 2 or 3 episodes that would have gone further toward tying up the loose ends.  I'm not really sure why Deb had to die, and that whole plot line seemed a bit contrived.  She just happens to get shot, develop a blood clot, and end up a rutabaga, which results in Dex having to essentially kill her.  In some ways, though, that pull-the-plug scene showed that Dex really HAD changed - from the emotionless psychopath to a genuinely loving brother/father, capable of self-sacrifice, capable of empathy.Some reviewers have said they felt he should have literally gone down with his boat, and Deb, in the storm.  And yet... I think the emotional impact of that final scene where he is clearly alone, goes to illustrate that he is aware of exactly what he is, precisely what he has done, and now he is ""paying the price.""  He upheld the code (in the sense that he never got caught - rule #1), but the ultimate irony may be that he ""caught"" himself - in seeing himself for who and what he was, he knew he could no longer afford to be around anyone he cared about, and so he chose the ultimate self-punishment - what amounts to a living hell of enforced solitude, isolated from any possibility of redemption... or was the isolation itself his attempt at redemption?I have to say the series did not end the way I WANTED it to end.  No happy endings for anybody.  But I felt it ended the only way it COULD have ended, all things considered.  I tend to re-watch my favorite series once every couple of years - and I wonder how I will see it with a bit more distance and hindsight.

I see that many people did not like season 8 as a whole, but I did find the premise very interesting and thought it was very interesting that Dexter actually started to change. THEN, the last episode ruined EVERYTHING for me.This season started to give us hope that Dexter might actually have a ""normal"" life and may have lost his compulsion to kill. He may not even be a psychopath - he seems to have a conscience and be capable of real love. Then, the last episode happens. Deb dies from a gunshot wound, and what does Dexter do? He steals her out of the hospital and dumps her in the ocean. How horrible. Dumped just like the pieces of trash serial killers he previously dumped. So, apparently he couldn't wait a week and have the plug pulled legally with a decent burial and funeral so all of her coworkers and loved ones can say goodbye.And then he fakes his own death because he has determined that he ruins every life he touched. EXCEPT, he has now lost the compulsion to kill, he is moving to South America, so how was he expecting to further ruin lives? Now, he HAS ruined the lives of Hannah, the love of his life, and his son, because he has now abandoned them forever. Gee, thanks Dexter.After watching the last episode, I just felt hopeless, frustrated, angry, and depressed. Thanks writers.

There has always been something addictive yet totally unbelievable about this series, yet we all waited for the next season. Will Dexter finally slip up and be caught or will his killing spree continue?Season 8 begins with a fractured Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter) dealing with her killing of Lt. LaGuerta in cold blood to save Dexter. She has committed murder and knows that her brother is a serial killer--although he never kills the innocent,It's this emotional trauma where Carpenter excels. She portrays Debra's emotional pain with intense zeal. The season is off to an interesting start.Enter the lovely Charlotte Rampling as Dr. Evelyn Vogel. Rampling has always been a favorite of mine and she doesn't disappoint us in her portrayal of the mysterious Vogel. Rampling speaks volumes with her eyes and expressions. Vogel studies the minds of serial killers and she instructed Dexter's father on creating &#34;the code.&#34; Dexter's murderous instincts will be directed to killing serial killers. Ok, the plot never made much sense considering Dexter works for the Miami Police Department.In Season 8, Vogel begins to see that Dexter does have feelings and emotions and possibly can feel love, guilt and compassion. Dexter is a rare type of serial killer. Unfortunately, another serial killer enters the picture and Dexter makes some fateful decisions.To complicate Dexter's life even more, Hannah McKay (Yvonne Strahovski) makes a reappearance. Nothing is as it seems.As always Dexter is one step ahead of the Miami Police and steals evidence that would lead the department to a killer. Most everyone is oblivious to Dexter's deeds and that falls into the category of disbelief. The writers have been able to keep us interested though nothing is ever plausible in the series. There is no doubt that it is time to say goodbye to Dexter.

He manages to solve a ton of problems in these twelve episodes.First he finds a surrogate mother for Harrison, and that was difficult to find. Luckily the only woman he had loved and that was still alive, apart from his sister turns up and re-activates some fundamental mechanisms. And Harrison likes her. She is very special but she wants to become a good girl.He manages to solve the problem of his father and how his father, a good cop, could accept his adoptive son to become a criminal, how he managed to come up with the code, etc. In fact the symbolical mother surrogate of his, of Dexter, comes up to him and reveals who she is and what she did. She reveals that his father OD&#8217;ed on his heart drug when he could not stand what Dexter had become any more. Dexter hates that doctor Vogel that has nothing of a bird in that story, at most a vulture but that is no  bird you try to attract in your garden with a bird feed and a bird bath.He has to solve a last case of a serial killer who is aiming at both him and Doctor Vogel. Her past is revealed and she becomes extremely dark and deep with one son killed by another, you know the story of Cain and Abel. And the killing son is sent East of Eden in some institution in England, or something far to the East. And there he is tortured into medical blankness since he is a criminal who deserves to be punished even if it is with drugs or some archaic violent treatment like electric shocks or other forceful manipulations of the body or the brain, and why not the mind and the imagination.Of course the dear son who was buried alive in this institution plans a good case of arson, with seven dead people in the wing that burns, and himself among these seven, officially, because&#8217; in fact he manages to get out, change identities and then move on, looking for mummy, Doctor Vogel, and all those she preferred to him, and first of all Dexter. And the blood trail can start under the police identity of the &#8220;brain surgeon&#8221; because he saws up the skull of his victim in a very special way and scoops out one very precise section of the brain and delivers these extracted sections to his mummy. A yummy appetizer for Christmas dinner or Thanksgiving celebrations.He of course has to save his sister from private investigation and then to make her a star in the Police Department. So he finally comes over his need to kill with his last victim and gives him over to Deborah for her to arrest him. But a Federal Marshall comes up and he completely messes the case, frees the criminal who kills him straight away, takes his gun, shoots Deborah who shoots him but in vain. And things will not turn honky dory and there will be some complications. Dexter then has to close up the file and clean up the plate. Deborah disappears in a hurricane.Finally he has to take care of himself and to protect Harrison and the substitute mother who has taken the boy to South America, and there is only one way. So he disappears with his boat into the hurricane. A tempestuous ending but it works.And yet they more or less kept one card up their sleeves, I mean the producers, for a sequel in let&#8217;s say five or ten years, when Harrison reaches teenage and starts moving towards finding his father and recuperating the father model he needs and remembers from his tumultuous first four years. Check amm by yourselves with the DVDs how they manage to keep one bun in the oven in slow gestation.You can always dream. But it is sure the author of the book series will be able to go on working with Dexter if he wants, though the last volume was announced a long time ago and will maybe finally come out next March (2014) and it is supposed to be entitled Dexter&#8217;s Final Cut, which promises quite some blood.We&#8217;ll see.

I loved this series!  I watched faithfully and never missed an episode.  And when I heard this was the last season, I was so hoping that the writers would come up with a spectacular ending (not necessarily happy, but something suitably jaw dropping).  What a disappointment!!  This season (to put it in a word) STUNK!  The pace was unbelievably slow and monotonous;  you thought, surely, surely, the writers were just building up to a grand finale - but then the finale came and it was not grand, or jaw dropping.The writing was weak, the interaction between the characters was weak.  It was like the writers just gave up and went on auto-pilot.  The bad guy of the season, the Brain Surgeon, should have been Dexter's greatest challenge - ending with an antagonist that he either couldn't beat, or gave his life trying to beat (which would have been a great ending).  But the Brain Surgeon wasn't scary, wasn't a great challenge, and really did nothing for the character development of Dexter.  While the writers were trying to tie up all the loose ends, they brought back Hannah (a decision by the writers I thought questionable), but then did nothing interesting with her character.  They killed off Deborah - in a most unspectacular, ho-hum way.  And the final straw was the ending...Dexter as lumberjack, WTH?!I could go on and on about how bad this season was.  Short story is, the writers took a brilliant series and butchered, just butchered, the ending.  It was so bad, I'm not even going to purchase this season on Blu-ray (I have purchased every other season)...I'm just going to pretend that this season never happened.",2,"Slow, Awkward Ending - a Complete Let Down of Expectations",1381363200,"10 10, 2013",2013,1766,"['WARNING', 'SPOILERSI', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'last', 'season', 'Dexter', 'one', 'star', 'respect', 'series', 'whole', 'gave', 'two', 'loved', 'series', 'watched', 'faithfully', 'never', 'missed', 'episode', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'last', 'season', 'was', 'so', 'hoping', 'writers', 'would', 'come', 'up', 'spectacular', 'ending', 'not', 'necessarily', 'happy', 'something', 'suitably', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'What', 'disappointment', 'season', 'put', 'word', 'STUNK', 'pace', 'was', 'unbelievably', 'slow', 'monotonous', 'thought', 'surely', 'surely', 'writers', 'were', 'just', 'building', 'up', 'grand', 'finale', 'then', 'finale', 'came', 'was', 'not', 'grand', 'jaw', 'dropping.The', 'writing', 'was', 'weak', 'interaction', 'characters', 'was', 'weak', 'was', 'writers', 'just', 'gave', 'up', 'went', 'auto-pilot', 'bad', 'guy', 'season', 'Brain', 'Surgeon', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Dexter', 'greatest', 'challenge', 'ending', 'antagonist', 'could', ""n't"", 'beat', 'gave', 'life', 'trying', 'beat', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'ending', 'Brain', 'Surgeon', 'was', ""n't"", 'scary', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'challenge', 'really', 'did', 'nothing', 'character', 'development', 'Dexter', 'writers', 'were', 'trying', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'brought', 'back', 'Hannah', 'decision', 'writers', 'thought', 'questionable', 'then', 'did', 'nothing', 'interesting', 'character', 'killed', 'off', 'Deborah', 'most', 'unspectacular', 'ho-hum', 'way', 'final', 'straw', 'was', 'ending', 'Dexter', 'lumberjack', 'WTH', 'could', 'go', 'how', 'bad', 'season', 'was', 'Short', 'story', 'writers', 'took', 'brilliant', 'series', 'butchered', 'just', 'butchered', 'ending', 'was', 'so', 'bad', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'going', 'purchase', 'season', 'Blu-ray', 'have', 'purchased', 'other', 'season', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'pretend', 'season', 'never', 'happened']",Dexter: The Complete Final Season

If you loved Dexter just leave him in the church with Deb telling him to put the knife down because this season just takes you on a nowhere trip to a complete downer of a finale that leaves you shaking your fists in anger.Major spoilers from here.Being that this is the final season why not let the villain be the most dangerous and vile of them all instead of this whimpering little brain surgeon-he didn't even rate and was pretty much dead on arrival.  A look back at the past baddies and this last guy was lacking in creativity- the bottom of the barrel not even worthy of the title serial killer maybe serial wimp.Charlotte Rampling was superb as Dr Evelyn Vogel inventor of Harry's code and provided a ho-hum storyline reuniting Deb and Dexter after the Laguerta killing.  She would have been cooler as the split personality, secret villain hopped on experimental acid that transforms her into a Ms. Hyde with superhuman strength that picks up younger men or women at night clubs for some afterhours romping but no she ends up getting killed by her own son, the wimpy brain surgeon.The Laguerta storyline from season 7 is where it all started going askew and provided this story arc about Deb quitting, blaming Dexter, trying to kill Dexter, forgiving Dexter, rejoining the force, starting to get back with Quinn and then left a stroked out vegetable while recovering from a gunshot wound.  Reads like a soap opera and not deserving of Showtime.  Deb deserved better than mercy killing then dumped in the ocean by Dexter with the rest of the vermin and why go through the trials and tribulations just to die poorly in the end.  Do you see and sense the frustration from the fans now?A more fitting ending - Deb is recovering in the hospital, the villain takes her hostage in front of Dexter and escapes by boat resulting in a spectacular, high speed boat chase with the hurricane roaring in the background.  Both boats get caught up in a huge whirlpool out in the ocean, Dexter makes a spectacular leap from his boat to Deb's, a close call, evenly matched fight with Dexter killing the villain the boat motor explodes unable to take the strain of keeping the boat from being pulled down into the deep, both Deb and Dexter jumped into Dexter's boat as it circles around them in the vortex.  Racing back to Miami Deb dies from her wounds and fast forward to Deb's funeral with full police honors.  A few months later, Dexters meet Hannah and Harrison in Argentina. Fade.Instead we get a hasty killing of the brain surgeon in police custody by Dexter.  No police department is that lame to let the brother of the victim in the building let alone the same room.Hannah, oh what a tease, this character provided so much promise as a vehicle for Dexter's character growth from killer to semi-normal but why all the courtship just to fake us out and end up a single mom to Harrison.  We kind of knew it was never going to end happily but Dexter exiled in Alaska in an even more absurd episode of Axe Men.  Ridiculous.The sales from a successful show season finale should be through the roof but instead the reviews are mixed and the fans upset by the ending.  If anything the final season seemed like it was hastily written from end to beginning without any thought to being creatively better than the past seasons just sub par and rather lumbering in pace.  Fans should be sad about the ending of a favorite show instead we're all mad about how it was ended.

Breaking Bad, for example, had the most heart breaking end imaginable, but it ended exactly as it should have ended. Nothing rang false about it. The finale of Dexter rang false from the start, and never improved. The writers seemed determined to punish the audience for liking Dexter and Deb. It was totally gratuitous to kill off Deb, after taking her to hell and back at the start of the season. She actually appeared to be on the cusp of making an independent life apart from Dexter, with a possibility of happiness. Getting shot by the Brain Surgeon was a surprise, but when her doctor said &#34;the bullet bounced around a lot, but didn't hit anything important&#34;, I thought it was just a clumsy device to excuse letting the serial killer prolong the hunt. To suddenly put her in a brain-dead coma felt tacked on and phony. And for Dexter to lumber Hannah with his son and send her off to Argentina so he could go off and be a lonely lumberjack was the most ridiculous, uncharacteristic contrivance in the history of TV. Dexter faking his own death while being the subject of a manhunt would have made a lot more sense. Even allowing Dexter to be caught as the Bay Harbor Butcher, or allowing his character to be killed, would have been preferable to the mess the writers made of this series. After watching the show for 8 years, the ending should have had the power to move me. Instead, I found myself rolling my eyes and muttering &#34;give me a break&#34; repeatedly. I still love the series, but I find it pretty easy to pretend Episode 12 never happened.",1,What a sadistic betrayal of a loyal audience. **SPOILERS**,1387929600,"12 25, 2013",2013,1681,"['would', 'never', 'have', 'given', 'one', 'star', 'series', 'finale', 'episode', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'dark', 'endings', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'example', 'had', 'most', 'heart', 'breaking', 'end', 'imaginable', 'ended', 'exactly', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'Nothing', 'rang', 'false', 'finale', 'Dexter', 'rang', 'false', 'start', 'never', 'improved', 'writers', 'seemed', 'determined', 'punish', 'audience', 'liking', 'Dexter', 'Deb', 'was', 'totally', 'gratuitous', 'kill', 'off', 'Deb', 'taking', 'hell', 'back', 'start', 'season', 'actually', 'appeared', 'be', 'cusp', 'making', 'independent', 'life', 'apart', 'Dexter', 'possibility', 'happiness', 'Getting', 'shot', 'Brain', 'Surgeon', 'was', 'surprise', 'when', 'doctor', 'said', '34', 'bullet', 'bounced', 'lot', 'did', ""n't"", 'hit', 'anything', 'important', '34', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'clumsy', 'device', 'excuse', 'letting', 'serial', 'killer', 'hunt', 'suddenly', 'put', 'brain-dead', 'coma', 'felt', 'tacked', 'phony', 'Dexter', 'lumber', 'Hannah', 'son', 'send', 'off', 'Argentina', 'could', 'go', 'off', 'be', 'lonely', 'lumberjack', 'was', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'uncharacteristic', 'contrivance', 'history', 'TV', 'Dexter', 'faking', 'own', 'death', 'being', 'subject', 'manhunt', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'lot', 'more', 'sense', 'Even', 'allowing', 'Dexter', 'be', 'caught', 'Bay', 'Harbor', 'Butcher', 'allowing', 'character', 'be', 'killed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'preferable', 'mess', 'writers', 'made', 'series', 'watching', 'show', '8', 'years', 'ending', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'power', 'move', 'Instead', 'found', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'muttering', '34', 'give', 'break', '34', 'repeatedly', 'still', 'love', 'series', 'find', 'pretty', 'easy', 'pretend', 'Episode', '12', 'never', 'happened']",Dexter: The Complete Final Season

Many people seem to dislike if because it's more serious tone and it's thematic deconstruction of Dexter's character.

The final episode exacerbates this and was criticised heavily for it. While I agree that the finale was not perfect, I believe that not giving the show a happy end was quite fitting and that the viewers should indeed have to experience along with Dexter that his actions would have consequences.Ending a show like Dexter is an almost impossible job, I feel the writers have pulled it off quite well and I can't understand all the negativity about this final season and it's finale at all. Calling the final season unbalanced and some of the twists illogical is preposterous considering what has happened in the previous seasons already, that this show is not too realistic should be clear to any fan by now.

1662379,A2XTBEWAF272NG,B00DXP7L88,Layo,"[1, 4]","I read the reviews of this season before I watched it, and I considered not even bothering.  Luckily, I disagree with those who panned it.SPOILERS FOLLOWI can't say that the ending surprised me, but I thought it was interesting in that Dexter's need to kill has to do with his need for control.  But his greatest loss is a death that was completely arbitrary; there was nothing anyone could have done to prevent it.  That's what life is like for most of us.  We get slapped with the fish of chaos, feel like our hearts are ripped out, realize we have no power to do anything in this ridiculous world but love the people we love and try to use our best judgment.  The most important things, those in which we are the most deeply invested, can be taken from us at any time.  That's why watching a show about a psychopath is such a nice break from reality.  We care, but he doesn't.  We suffer, but he doesn't.  We have no power when it counts the most, but he can do anything he wants to anyone and get away with it.  There are probably times when we've really felt kicked around by other people and wished we could handle things the way he does.  But we can't, because we *do* feel empathy, attachment, and fear; living vicariously through this show is about as good as it gets.  (This makes me wonder whether psychopaths love sappy kid's movies about animals or something, so they can live through us a little bit - that would be symmetrical, but a bit hard to imagine.)This season is interesting because he finally lets go.  As the last body sinks below the waves and he surrenders to the onrushing hurricane, he realizes that his need for control destroys everyone he loves, and because he does love those who still survive he has to let them all go.  Great ending.  It's hard to know whether this sacrifice of his anchor to his nascent humanity - his love for certain other people - qualifies as redemption.  It seems humbler than that.  It's more that he realizes he's doomed.  No matter how high the body count gets, he will never have absolute power, and no matter how much he tries to change, he can never be something that he's not.  He can't resist playing the game other psychopaths bait him into; like calls unto like, and that's who he is - he's been that way in every episode, he has to play and win.  And he did always win as long as he felt no inner conflict; his mistakes were always the product of ambivalence.  But when he has people in his life whom he not just loves but needs, the  conflict between the desire to protect and the desire to destroy makes him a victim just like the rest of us.  He can't be a perfect predator anymore, and ironically his awakened heart's mercy makes things worse for everybody: he can't coldly commit himself to the most effective strategy, and hesitation gets people killed.I felt like this caused me to explore some things about my own life, since I'm about his age.  When I was young, I could drop anyone or anything without a glance back.  My heart was like an etch-a-sketch, and every few years it would get shaken hard.  I could shed an old life like a skin and it would be a relief; I never thought about the past much.  Now I'm of an age where I realize I want roots, and I'm not sure how to make this new paradigm work for me.  I really feel what Dexter was going through.  How do you become real, instead of skulking through the world like an alien imposter?  How do you cultivate life, when your very nature is soaked from birth in disruptions, rejection and endings?The show's creators' answer is that you can't, not even when people know your secrets and accept you for who you are and love you - at least not if you can't make a clear choice between your old MO and a swiftly-crafted and *effective* new one.  He was headed in the right direction, I felt, but for such a dangerous person growing pains are likely to be fatal.  I appreciate what this season did in terms of confronting this final paradox - that love and violence, or mercy and severity, seemingly cannot succeed when practiced simultaneously, and yet without power we are also screwed.  For Dexter, love is not enough, and now neither is control.

1662397,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B00DXP7L88,Melissa Niksic,"[55, 77]","""Dexter"" went from being one of the greatest shows on television to one of the worst. And it pains me to say this, but the series finale was quite possibly the worst in TV history. Seriously. The ""Seinfeld"" finale is golden compared to this one.I feel that ""Dexter"" went steadily downhill after Season 4, which admittedly was so freaking fantastic that it would be next to impossible for anything else to measure up. However, Season 8 was by far the worst of all. The Dr. Vogel plot was weak and a terrible way to wrap up what was once a great series. Let's just get to the finale, which is the absolute worst thing about this season. (Warning: massive spoilers ahead.)1. I had this feeling that Deb's character would meet an unfortunate end, but it really seemed unnecessary here. Does everyone in the show have to be miserable at the end?2. Hannah is now raising Harrison in Argentina. Really? Would it have been so awful to have Dexter flee Miami and at least leave Harrison with Deb? (And, you know, keep Deb alive?) And how is Hannah raising Harrison a good idea? Need I remind everyone that she is a serial killer also? Maybe of a different breed than Dexter, but still. What about his grandparents, Rita's parents? Dexter never thought that Harrison might be better off in the care of his family and siblings? And isn't anyone going to wonder what happened to Harrison after Dexter is declared dead? No one will think he was out on that boat. Dexter never would have taken Harrison out in a hurricane. Hmm.3. I don't think Deb ever fully resolved her ""I am in love with my brother"" issues. They were revealed at the end of Season 6, and then it's like the writers went, ""Yeah, that was weird. Let's just not talk about it and pretend it never happened.""4. The whole Dexter dumping Deb's body in the water was odd to say the least. I kept waiting for Harry's apparition to return and say something like, ""I know you don't need me anymore, Dexter, but I'm back to tell you that even I don't know what the heck you're trying to do right now!""5. I was so sure that the finale would wrap up with Matthews letting Dexter off the hook somehow, and with Dexter learning that Matthews was somehow in on everything via Harry from the very beginning. The show even set it up to be that way over the past couple of seasons, but then nothing happened with that at all. Same with all the other supporting characters. I get that the show was mainly about Dexter, but the audience received zero closure on everything else.6. That final scene...you know, the one where Dexter is now Wolverine?! I guess I understand the self-imposed exile, after what happened to Deb. However, the last few episodes leading up to the finale were all about Dexter remarking on how he didn't even really have the urge to kill anymore, and he just wanted to spend time with his new family and build a life with them. I don't understand how all that vanished after Deb, and how abandoning his son seemed like the only way to go.So there you have it. I am still reeling after watching the finale and am super bummed. I feel like the producers really let the audience down. Dexter himself let me down, too. He just kind of threw in the towel at the end.

Dexter is psychological and focuses on suspense. Breaking Bad features an egomaniacal protagonist and way more action. Apples and oranges. Dexter's finale is bashed often because it didn't end the way viewers wanted it to end. (Sarcasm alert) Imagine that...an unpredictable finale...BOOOOOO! Who wants a conclusion that's open to interpretation? Spoon feed us a fairy tale ending or a ramboesque shoot-out please....God forbid we think or try to read between the lines! Dexter ended appropriately. Anything different would've been too sappy or too expected.I see only 2 flaws with the final season. (1) The ""Brain surgeon"", Dexter's last obstacle, should've been more menacing. (2) It was odd that the writers tried to develop supporting characters with pointless side plots that in no way affected Dexter's journey (e.g. Mazuka's biological daughter finds him. Quinn's nomination for sargent and his relationship with the nanny) Dexter has always been about 1 character, hence its title. Michael Hall hogged the scenes for 7 years the same way Allen Iverson hogged the ball in Philly. There was no need to finally focus on character development so late in the game.

1662402,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B00DXP7L88,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","Fair warning, this will contain some spoilers from the 8th season and previous seasons, so proceed at your own risk...I am conflicted about the season because on one hand I think it did very well in explaining the rest of Dexter's back story and introducing Vogel as almost a surrogate mother to him. On the other hand, the end was a very big letdown. I actually really liked the first part of the season, just did not like the direction they took the last handful of episodes. I think the series always had to end with him either dying or everyone finding out exactly who he was and him trying to get away. And while he did not exactly get away without any consequences, the show does end with everyone from his past life thinking he was who they always thought he was.The show always straddled the line between portraying him as a good guy, vigilante and a killer who needed to be put down. It was most compelling when he was just on the brink of being caught for what he did, or when his &#34;other work&#34; came too close to his personal life and put others in danger. Throughout the series really only three people ever found out that he was a killer (who were not already killers themselves). I think the show really almost had to end with everyone becoming aware of that fact, and I personally think the season would have been more compelling if the last few shows were about him having to deal with the repercussions of everybody realizing he was in fact the Bay Harbor Butcher as opposed to taking out one final bad guy.With that said, accepting what they did do with the season and the direction it was taken, I think it was done well overall. From the story with Vogel, taking on an apprentice of sorts, the return of Hanna and fixing his relationship with Deb, were all good stories, and the acting as usual was very good. The one thing I do like about how the series ended is that he did not get to live happily ever after and that his self imposed exile was a pretty miserable looking existence.As for the set itself for those who get the discs. Like the other seasons the episodes are spread across three discs. There is commentary on some episodes and 5 or 6 relatively short behind the scenes features. The first two episodes of the new series Ray Donovan are also included.

As someone who has been watching since day one, season eight had fallen so far off the cliff that it was barely recognizable. It's obvious the shows writers were milking Dexter for all that was worth, trying to get as much money out of it as they possibly can. Arguably, the last truly great season Dexter had was the fourth season with the Trinity Killer. A good case could be made that the first, second and fourth seasons were Dexter's best, after that it went off a cliff and it just kept getting worse from there.There were too many loose ends in the eight and final season. Matsuka finds out he has a daughter but the story was never fleshed out. One Tree Hill star Bethany Joy Lenz appeared in a few episodes but nothing really came of her character. Hannah McKay returning and they have this long-winded arc where she and Dexter and his son Harrison are going to move to Argentina permanently and forget about their troubles.

That or they were fighting with each other on how to end the series and never came to a good agreement.Everybody likes to go out on a high note.A boxer wants to retire stilling holding the title.A TV show likes to say goodbye when the quality is still high and the ratings are still good.It is unpleasant and sometimes sad to see something outlive it's quality of life.Personally I hate to see DEXTER leave the air.My wife and I have really liked the characters.So I might personally like to see DEXTER go on and on ""forever"".But the logical part of my mind understands why it is probably artistically best for the show to exit now while it is still riding high and not die a whimpering death of mediocrity.As it is, the last few episodes suffer from some bad writing and very, very illogical actions on the part of Dexter that are not believable, make no sense, and seem to just be an excuse to create problems for our characters.I won't say too much except it is the same old ..........""Dexter hesitates doing what he knows is the smart thing to do and somebody suffers ""........  plot device they have used in 5 of the 8 seasons.But this time, it is so badly and obviously used many fans will say the show ""jumped the shark"".All in all -- I don't want to criticize the hard work and great acting talents that go into making a show like this , BUT ..... Dexter should have had a better written season for his final farewell.",3,"As a rule, most shows begin to weaken after 7 seasons",1379030400,"09 13, 2013",2013,2910,"['years', 'have', 'noticed', 'most', 'TV', 'shows', 'seem', 'start', 'weakening', 'bit', '7', 'seasons.This', 'not', 'criticism', 'writers', 'simply', 'think', 'difficult', 'keep', 'interesting', 'flow', 'going', 'given', 'set', 'characters', 'general', 'premise.Dexter', 'different.I', 'am', 'writing', 'review', 'only', '2', 'episodes', 'left', 'Series', 'Finale', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'need', 'update', 'when', 'DVD', 'ships', 'make', 'comments', 'aspect', '.Dexter', 'Season', '8', 'starts', 'very', 'good', 'fades', 'mid', 'season', 'close', 'absurd.However', 'acting', 'superb.BUT', 'can', 'feel', 'writers', 'were', 'struggling', 'wrap', 'up', 'Dexter', 'universe', 'result', 'general', 'storyline', 'bit', 'forced', 'season.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'risk', 'writing', 'spoilers', 'Dexter', 'decisions', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'character', 'are', 'more', 'help', 'end', 'story', 'arc.The', 're-appearance', 'older', 'characters', 'past', 'seasons', 'also', 'seem', 'lack', 'continuity', 'past', 'events', 'are', 'easily', 'dismissed', 'ignored', 'new', 'relationships', 'are', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'are', 'unusual', 'clever', 'writing', 'historically', 'been', 'part', 'show.It', 'times', 'character', 'personalities', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'forcibly', 'fit', 'SERIES', 'FINALE.You', 'will', 'note', 'still', 'gave', '3', 'Star', 'review.You', 'get', 'feeling', 'writers', 'were', 'starting', 'run', 'out', 'ideas', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'happy', 'end', 'series', 'now', 'instead', 'being', 'challenged', 'keep', 'quality', 'high', '2,3,4+', 'seasons', 'were', 'fighting', 'other', 'how', 'end', 'series', 'never', 'came', 'good', 'agreement.Everybody', 'likes', 'go', 'out', 'high', 'note.A', 'boxer', 'retire', 'stilling', 'holding', 'title.A', 'TV', 'show', 'say', 'goodbye', 'when', 'quality', 'still', 'high', 'ratings', 'are', 'still', 'good.It', 'unpleasant', 'sometimes', 'sad', 'see', 'something', 'quality', 'life.Personally', 'hate', 'see', 'DEXTER', 'leave', 'air.My', 'wife', 'have', 'really', 'liked', 'characters.So', 'might', 'personally', 'like', 'see', 'DEXTER', 'go', 'forever', 'logical', 'part', 'mind', 'why', 'probably', 'artistically', 'best', 'show', 'exit', 'now', 'still', 'riding', 'high', 'not', 'die', 'whimpering', 'death', 'mediocrity.As', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'suffer', 'bad', 'writing', 'very', 'very', 'illogical', 'actions', 'part', 'Dexter', 'are', 'not', 'believable', 'make', 'sense', 'seem', 'just', 'be', 'excuse', 'create', 'problems', 'characters.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'too', 'much', 'same', 'old', 'Dexter', 'doing', 'what', 'smart', 'thing', 'do', 'somebody', 'suffers', 'plot', 'device', 'have', 'used', '5', '8', 'seasons.But', 'time', 'so', 'badly', 'obviously', 'used', 'many', 'fans', 'will', 'say', 'show', 'jumped', 'shark', '.All', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'criticize', 'hard', 'work', 'great', 'acting', 'talents', 'go', 'making', 'show', 'BUT', '..', 'Dexter', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'better', 'written', 'season', 'final', 'farewell']",Dexter: The Complete Final Season

Granted, Deb ends up poorly.The show was pretty good up until last season, when it started going south and Dexter became so desperate about his kills that he'd have made mistake after mistake and would have definitely gotten caught.

They didn't have much to do for the final episode.  The next to last episode ended great, but I guess the writers are attention deprived pansies who have to &#34;shake things up&#34; in the end.  So what do these guys do?  It was fine half way through but in the last 20 minutes or so they kill off a main character, and then change the ending completely.

However even taking the most optimistic of viewpoints it's a very poor fit for a final season. Simply put the feel of the final season should have been along the lines of Season 2, that feeling of the world closing in on Dexter and that he was going to get caught. Unfortunately since that material had already been mined fans were instead left with a somewhat generic serial killer hunt and family dysfunction storyline that just felt like a retread of earlier seasons.(MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW)There's some interesting things going on with the introduction of Dr. Vogel as a surrogate mother figure. This also gives some very interesting ideas as to whether or not Dexter is unique or if his code can in fact be tought. Dexter has let various people in on his homocidal side but has never truly taken on an apprentice or tried to instill Harry's Code on another. It's an interesting notion, though sadly it's also cut short before it really gets good.What's going on with Deb throughout the season feels largely obligatory. Obviously she couldn't just be ok with how things ended the previous season, but except for one or two key moments there's nothing very unexpected about her downward spiral. Largely the season as a whole feels obligatory and not climactic.(SPOILERS END)It would have been just an OK finish if not for the final episode. The choices made and the way they are presented are simply mind boggling. Very little of what happens is satisfying and it's presented in a way completely devoid of the tension that Dexter has always been about as a show. It feels like it was made by completely different people who'd never seen an episode of Dexter before. If it weren't for this final episode most would shrug this off, but the actual finale is wrong on so many levels it taints not only this season but the show as a whole.",2,A Passable Season Sunk by an Attrocious Finale,1382400000,"10 22, 2013",2013,1956,"['honesty', 'most', 'Season', '8', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'many', 'fans', 'say', 'final', 'episode', ""'ll"", 'come', 'back', 'However', 'even', 'taking', 'most', 'optimistic', 'viewpoints', 'very', 'poor', 'fit', 'final', 'season', 'Simply', 'put', 'feel', 'final', 'season', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'lines', 'Season', '2', 'feeling', 'world', 'closing', 'Dexter', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'caught', 'Unfortunately', 'material', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'mined', 'fans', 'were', 'instead', 'left', 'somewhat', 'generic', 'serial', 'killer', 'hunt', 'family', 'dysfunction', 'storyline', 'just', 'felt', 'retread', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'MINOR', 'SPOILERS', 'FOLLOW', 'interesting', 'things', 'going', 'introduction', 'Dr.', 'Vogel', 'surrogate', 'mother', 'figure', 'also', 'very', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'not', 'Dexter', 'unique', 'code', 'can', 'fact', 'be', 'tought', 'Dexter', 'let', 'various', 'people', 'homocidal', 'side', 'never', 'truly', 'taken', 'apprentice', 'tried', 'instill', 'Harry', 'Code', 'interesting', 'notion', 'though', 'sadly', 'also', 'cut', 'short', 'really', 'good.What', 'going', 'Deb', 'season', 'feels', 'largely', 'obligatory', 'Obviously', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'be', 'ok', 'how', 'things', 'ended', 'previous', 'season', 'one', 'two', 'key', 'moments', 'nothing', 'very', 'unexpected', 'downward', 'spiral', 'Largely', 'season', 'whole', 'feels', 'obligatory', 'not', 'climactic', 'SPOILERS', 'END', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'OK', 'finish', 'not', 'final', 'episode', 'choices', 'made', 'way', 'are', 'presented', 'are', 'simply', 'mind', 'boggling', 'Very', 'little', 'what', 'satisfying', 'presented', 'way', 'completely', 'devoid', 'tension', 'Dexter', 'always', 'been', 'about', 'show', 'was', 'made', 'completely', 'different', 'people', 'who', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'episode', 'Dexter', 'were', ""n't"", 'final', 'episode', 'most', 'would', 'shrug', 'off', 'actual', 'finale', 'wrong', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'not', 'only', 'season', 'show', 'whole']",Dexter: The Complete Final Season

Overall I feel it was as good as I expected it to be - and that it was time to end the series anyway.  Most of my reviews for the other seasons were 5-stars, this is a fantastic series!There are some fantastic, very memorable scenes in this season, and some that you will feel you they could have done without - but honestly it's like that every season.  Season 2 was probably my overall favorite, Dokes and his interactions with Dexter really made it great.  This season focuses more on winding everything down with the story lines, filling some holes in the history of Dexter and how things came to be with him, and of course building up to the ending.  The problem I think most folks have is that it had a slower feel to it because of all the holes they were trying to fill for those of us who really wanted to understand Dexter more.  Some of the folks that I talked to who were disappointed were hoping for huge fireworks of slaughter with Dexter laying person after person on his table every episode - it wasn't like that (and I don't consider that a spoiler, more of a warning to the folks who are hoping for it).

Almost like a fairy-tale. The characters are able to surround themselves in blood, gore, and chopped up body parts and continue eating, loving, and smiling. Well what does this say about the production?  Combined with all the horror is great acting, well written scripts using interior monologues and attractive Miami scenery. There were few moments of fill, usually no long drives, or waiting outsides someone's door. Action , and purpose driven by how the outcome would happen moves the script. On the whole it is a rousing 5 stars. Sadly the last hours except for the ending were stretched too far. The need to rush through got me. The ending was a shock but understandable. When a family is thrown into complete chaos by a gruesome murder there will be tragic consequences. Finally the series ends realistically and that is a shock.Psychologically the series  is  a symbolic portrayal of our collapsing culture. Or is our need for revenge, for the cultures lack of compassion, that I and others are able to get behind this series, and enjoy the anger that surely the murders represent.

That this followed a really surprising and yet fitting turn of events with Deb made an uncomfortable contrast.

I was a HUGE fan of this series. Dexter, together with Breaking Bad were the two best series I have ever watched, but then they had to ruin Dexter in Season 8. The problems started early, since right from the beginning of the season the episodes were dull and boring. Dexter was a different character and things were moving really slow. It felt like the writers did not really know where the story was going and with each episode they were changing their mind. This left us with a bland and unsatisfying plot.Of course, there was no way I was going to stop watching one of my favorite shows, so I kept plugging away and watching each week. At the end of each episode I would feel like things were wrong, but I did not want to believe that things were this bad. Surely they were going to find a way to make it up to us and to deliver a grand finale that would make us forget. And indeed they did, but not in the way I was expecting. They gave us a final episode that does not make us forget their mistakes, they gave us one that makes us want to forget this season even existed.I have a hard time to believe that fans of this series can be satisfied with this final season.

You really can't impose logic on a series where every serial killer and mass murderer decides to come to Miami and the homicide division can't be bothered to do more than show up, look at the bodies and then complain when their prime suspect suddenly disappears. The question of why hasn't Dexter gotten caught yet seemed to make less sense as the series went on and by the fifth or sixth seasons, you just had to assume that Dexter had magical powers like the killers in Frailty. As long as you didn't think too hard, you could enjoy season after season of the most charming sociopath on television (besides Dennis Miller, of course).Yet, this season is already hated by many throughout the internet. And even by Dexter standards it's pretty bad. One of the main problems with Dexter is the filler episodes. A Dexter season is 13 episodes long and most seasons, the writers are struggling to stretch 7-8 episodes worth of story into 13 episodes. You can usually see when they are doing it. Suddenly, the Miami Homicide Division becomes a combination of General Hospital and Everybody Loves Raymond with stories going to Matsuka and Batista. Dexter thinks that he's making a friend or finding a protege. You kind of go with them because something else needs to happen. Eventually everything comes together and Dexter is back to hunting the serial killers.In this season, they weren't even trying write 7 episodes. At most, this is a 4 episode season. The filler becomes even more egregious. Deb has a nervous breakdown that can fill its own series. There's a psychologist who knew Dexter's dad. There's a kid that could be a protege. Hey, look, it's Hannah! In the non-Dexter filler, the story is even worse. Batista encourages the detective to try for sergeant but then hires Miller - because she's competent and also black which works better in the department and COMPLETELY OFF CAMERA the entire season. She's like Tito on My So-Called Life. No one sees her. Matsuka finds out that he has a daughter due to the sperm donations. That story circles the drain.Even the final episode is pure filler. There is really no reason why the writers couldn't have ended it by episode 12 except that they needed another show. So they have Dexter go against type in order to justify a final episode and even that doesn't really work well.Still, it's Dexter and if you lower your expectations and just know that it will insult your intelligence, you will have a good time. One caveat. Deb becomes particularly awful this season. In almost every scene she is either crying or having a nervous breakdown or sucking the life out of the series.
