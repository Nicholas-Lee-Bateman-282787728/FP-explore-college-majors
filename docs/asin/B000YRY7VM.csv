1120791,AYFFWPUMI2MDH,B000YRY7VM,BKR,"[0, 0]","Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) seems never to be really happy, and peculiar things are always happening to him. He's not the easiest person to love and live with, but his long-suffering wife, Margaret (Annette Crosbie) handles him better than anyone else could. There is also a cast of characters who come in and out of the Meldrew's life as well as friends and neighbors who remain constant delights. Part slapstick part sitcom and part black comedy, you'll either love this series or hate it. I love it and own several of the 6 seasons. I wish there had been 6 more. I've just recently started watching them again and adding the rest of the seasons to my collection. I can't imagine any other actors playing Victor and Margaret - these two are perfect.",5,A bit dark but always hilarious,1390780800,"01 27, 2014",2014,755,"['Victor', 'Meldrew', 'Richard', 'Wilson', 'never', 'be', 'really', 'happy', 'peculiar', 'things', 'are', 'always', 'happening', 'not', 'easiest', 'person', 'love', 'live', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'Margaret', 'Annette', 'Crosbie', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'could', 'also', 'cast', 'characters', 'who', 'come', 'Meldrew', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'who', 'remain', 'constant', 'delights', 'Part', 'slapstick', 'part', 'sitcom', 'part', 'black', 'comedy', ""'ll"", 'either', 'love', 'series', 'hate', 'love', 'own', 'several', '6', 'seasons', 'wish', 'had', 'been', '6', 'more', ""'ve"", 'just', 'recently', 'started', 'watching', 'again', 'adding', 'rest', 'seasons', 'collection', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'other', 'actors', 'playing', 'Victor', 'Margaret', 'two', 'are', 'perfect']",One Foot in the Grave: Season 3

1120795,A1NIMHZNYMGNUL,B000YRY7VM,Mark  Durand,"[3, 3]","David Renwick has created a very unique Brit-com. Created during the waning days of the Thather/Reagan era partly as a statement of how the Governments had neglected the needs of many people such as the Elderly, the young, the needy and so on. These issues were made comic fodder for our hero Victor Meldrew, a man who goes to work one day to discover that he's been replaced by a box. At 60 years old Victor feels that he has many good years left and  now faces a new life and how to keep busy.Victor's wife, Margaret tries to help as best she can, but she's not the biggest fan of his passions. (magic, ventriloquism) Victor's biggest passion seems to be correcting the wrongs of the world which he attempts with great enthusiasm. Most often these endeavors end in disaster, but on occasion they are successful such as an encounter with a computer salesman that's comic gold, as well as what happens when he awakes in the hospital, thinks he's dead and sees a man who he thinks to be God.To some, the dark, sick and twisted scripts may be off putting. On first viewing, one would think that Mr. Renwick hates Victor but the true payoff is that after all the disasters and fights, at the heart, Victor and Margaret truly love each other and Mr. Renwick does a wonderful job of showing us this without beating us over the head with it as would happen on American TV.Richard Wilson brings great life to Victor. We feel Victor's pain when he goes too far and tries to make amends to a world who, sadly doesn't care. This is a fairly complicated series (on American standards) i  is certainly not as wild and broad as a Fawlty Towers or a Thin Blue Line but it's well worth a look",4,WELL WORTH A VIEW.......,1208390400,"04 17, 2008",2008,1677,"['David', 'Renwick', 'created', 'very', 'unique', 'Brit-com', 'Created', 'waning', 'days', 'Thather/Reagan', 'era', 'partly', 'statement', 'how', 'Governments', 'had', 'neglected', 'needs', 'many', 'people', 'such', 'Elderly', 'young', 'needy', 'so', 'issues', 'were', 'made', 'comic', 'fodder', 'hero', 'Victor', 'Meldrew', 'man', 'who', 'work', 'one', 'day', 'discover', 'been', 'replaced', 'box', '60', 'years', 'old', 'Victor', 'many', 'good', 'years', 'left', 'now', 'new', 'life', 'how', 'keep', 'busy.Victor', 'wife', 'Margaret', 'help', 'best', 'can', 'not', 'biggest', 'fan', 'passions', 'magic', 'ventriloquism', 'Victor', 'biggest', 'passion', 'be', 'correcting', 'wrongs', 'world', 'great', 'enthusiasm', 'Most', 'often', 'endeavors', 'end', 'disaster', 'occasion', 'are', 'successful', 'such', 'encounter', 'computer', 'salesman', 'comic', 'gold', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'when', 'hospital', 'dead', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'God.To', 'dark', 'sick', 'twisted', 'scripts', 'may', 'be', 'off', 'putting', 'first', 'viewing', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'Mr.', 'Renwick', 'Victor', 'true', 'payoff', 'disasters', 'fights', 'heart', 'Victor', 'Margaret', 'truly', 'love', 'other', 'Mr.', 'Renwick', 'wonderful', 'job', 'showing', 'beating', 'head', 'as', 'would', 'happen', 'American', 'TV.Richard', 'Wilson', 'great', 'life', 'Victor', 'feel', 'Victor', 'pain', 'when', 'too', 'far', 'tries', 'make', 'amends', 'world', 'who', 'sadly', ""n't"", 'care', 'fairly', 'complicated', 'series', 'American', 'standards', 'i', 'certainly', 'not', 'wild', 'broad', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'Thin', 'Blue', 'Line', 'well', 'look']",One Foot in the Grave: Season 3
1120796,A29M09QBG9TZLP,B000YRY7VM,"Shana ""That's my opinion- I could be wrong!""","[5, 5]","I just love this show! I found it by accident when purchasing other British comedies on Amazon. It's a comedy along the lines of Fawlty Towers, The Thin Blue Line and Blackadder. Yet, One Foot in the Grave is distinctly unique. It covers an overlooked segment of the population (the recently retired & aging segment).If you have never saw One Foot in the Grave, start at season 1 and work your way up. The show and characters are more enjoyable watched in order, as many times they will work off something that occured in a previous show. Season 3 is perhaps the best of the series, so far, with the characters having grown and really filling out their roles.An overview of the story (starting at Season 1), is about a 60 year old man (Mr. Victor Meldrew) whom is forced into retirement and has his whole life turned upside down. As he battles against a world that now longer makes sense, trouble seems to find him at every corner. Richard Wilson plays Victor Meldrew and Annette Crosbie plays as his wife Margaret Meldrew. Both Crosbie and Wilson are hysterical & believable. Victor being on the brink of a breakdown all the time, and his wife the voice of sanity, that brings humor to every situation. Or is Victor the sanest of them all? The older I get the more I identify with grumpy ole' Victor Meldrew.Great show that gets funnier every season.

I have to wonder what they were like before Victor was forced to retire. Too bad they never filmed a flashback episode! Included with Season Three is a Christmas special. If you're unfamiliar with One Foot in the Grave, please don't expect this to be the least bit Christmasy! True, there is a pile of manure with Christmas lights strung across it, but that's as seasonal as it gets. I had never seen this special, and found it hilarious, although, in keeping with this series, there are dark moments as well.
