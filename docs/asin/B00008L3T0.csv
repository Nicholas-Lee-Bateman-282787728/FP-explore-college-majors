Salama,"[2, 3]","When it came out, this satire of Hollywood filmmaking (Alan Smithee is the alias directors take when their film has been butchered by the producers and they are too ashamed of the final product) was reviewed as if it was about the worst film ever made. Actually, this movie is nowhere nearly as bad as it's supposed to be. It's artless and amateurish at times, but it's also quite funny. You've got to have some interest in the Hollywood scene to appreciate it. Otherwise, it might look like a waste of time and celluloid.",3,Hollywood satire nowhere near as bad as it is supposed to be,1204156800,"02 28, 2008",2008,522,"['When', 'came', 'out', 'satire', 'Hollywood', 'filmmaking', 'Alan', 'Smithee', 'alias', 'directors', 'take', 'when', 'film', 'been', 'butchered', 'producers', 'are', 'too', 'ashamed', 'final', 'product', 'was', 'reviewed', 'was', 'worst', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'Actually', 'movie', 'nowhere', 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'supposed', 'be', 'artless', 'amateurish', 'times', 'also', 'quite', 'funny', ""'ve"", 'got', 'have', 'interest', 'Hollywood', 'scene', 'appreciate', 'Otherwise', 'might', 'look', 'waste', 'time', 'celluloid']",Burn Hollywood Burn

It was like finding plutonium in the middle of a desert. All right, the first time I saw the picture, I remembered falling asleep. Now I saw it again, and I thought initially that maybe it couldn't be worse than the crap that Hollywood had been churning out these days. Well, guess what? It's that bad. There was not one single part that was deemed to be good about An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn. It's unpretentiously boring junk about bunch of losers talking about whether if a film got made or not. It didn't make sense. Why not just sue the director and make the dough from insurance? Regardless, I personally couldn't give rat's ass. When Whoopi Goldberg made her cameo, the crap started to hit the fan. Then the incessant rubbish chatter made the fan to grease its wheels a bit more. When the two black nitwits showed up, the fan got to the point of hurling crap farther than before. When Sylvester Stallone agreed to take part in this piece of junk, I seriously thought his career was over in a flash until he made a recent small, albeit lame as in nothing-new-with-him, comeback. Ryan O'Neal already kissed his career good-bye decades earlier, so why bother beating a dead horse again? The actors and actresses, who took a part in An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn, should never work in a film ever again. They were all terrible and should be shot and their remains burned to ashes. In what was supposed to resemble the message of Sunset Boulevard, An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn went far off the cliff and disappeared in its entirety, breaking an old chemistry law ""matter is neither created nor destroyed."" The claims on the VHS box of the film read: ""Hilarious!,"" ""Outrageous!,"" and ""One of the funniest movies in ages!"" Excuse me if I yawn...interminably. By the way, once upon a time, some comedian made a name for himself by mocking the film Jaws: the Revenge, and his name was Richard Jeni, the same schmuck who was opposite of Ryan O'Neal. Later, he committed suicide. Perhaps he finally found out that he had been a loser after all?",1,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible!",1296086400,"01 27, 2011",2011,2239,"['Viewed', '11/03', '5/08Rate', '15/08', 'Imagine', 'surprise', 'when', 'discovered', 'VHS', 'copy', 'Alan', 'Smithee', 'Film', 'Burn', 'Hollywood', 'Burn', 'flea', 'market', 'years', 'back', 'was', 'finding', 'plutonium', 'middle', 'desert', 'right', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'picture', 'remembered', 'falling', 'asleep', 'Now', 'saw', 'again', 'thought', 'initially', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'worse', 'crap', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'been', 'churning', 'days', 'Well', 'guess', 'what', 'bad', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'part', 'was', 'deemed', 'be', 'good', 'Alan', 'Smithee', 'Film', 'Burn', 'Hollywood', 'Burn', 'unpretentiously', 'boring', 'junk', 'bunch', 'losers', 'talking', 'film', 'got', 'made', 'not', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'sue', 'director', 'make', 'dough', 'insurance', 'Regardless', 'personally', 'could', ""n't"", 'give', 'rat', 'ass', 'When', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'made', 'cameo', 'crap', 'started', 'hit', 'fan', 'Then', 'incessant', 'rubbish', 'chatter', 'made', 'fan', 'grease', 'wheels', 'bit', 'more', 'When', 'two', 'black', 'nitwits', 'showed', 'up', 'fan', 'got', 'point', 'hurling', 'crap', 'farther', 'before', 'When', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'agreed', 'take', 'part', 'piece', 'junk', 'seriously', 'thought', 'career', 'was', 'over', 'flash', 'made', 'recent', 'small', 'albeit', 'lame', 'nothing-new-with-him', 'comeback', 'Ryan', ""O'Neal"", 'already', 'kissed', 'career', 'good-bye', 'decades', 'earlier', 'so', 'why', 'bother', 'beating', 'dead', 'horse', 'again', 'actors', 'actresses', 'who', 'took', 'part', 'Alan', 'Smithee', 'Film', 'Burn', 'Hollywood', 'Burn', 'should', 'never', 'work', 'film', 'ever', 'again', 'were', 'terrible', 'should', 'be', 'shot', 'remains', 'burned', 'ashes', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'resemble', 'message', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'Alan', 'Smithee', 'Film', 'Burn', 'Hollywood', 'Burn', 'went', 'far', 'cliff', 'disappeared', 'entirety', 'breaking', 'old', 'chemistry', 'law', 'matter', 'neither', 'created', 'destroyed', 'claims', 'VHS', 'box', 'film', 'read', 'Hilarious', 'Outrageous', 'One', 'funniest', 'movies', 'ages', 'yawn', 'interminably', 'way', 'once', 'time', 'comedian', 'made', 'name', 'mocking', 'film', 'Jaws', 'Revenge', 'name', 'was', 'Richard', 'Jeni', 'same', 'schmuck', 'who', 'was', 'opposite', 'Ryan', ""O'Neal"", 'Later', 'committed', 'suicide', 'Perhaps', 'finally', 'found', 'out', 'had', 'been', 'loser']",Burn Hollywood Burn

You have to feel sorry for some of the stars who signed on, especially Whoopi Goldberg, who as an OSCAR winning actress, really deserves better. Eric Idle comes off unfunny, even irritating, which, as a Python star I'd never thought would be possible. Sly Stallone seems fed up, but maybe thankful for the work after his career was beginning to dry up (though his career seems to be revived at the moment).It says a lot when the parody (this film) seems worse than the movie genre it is taking a shot at.

Evans looks like a walking train wreck and nearly makes one vomit to have to see that heavily-tanned cowhide skin of his.And Naomi Baca? Hands down--the best thing about this dreck of a flick.
