Holly ""DVD fan""","[0, 0]","Of all the Buddies movies that I've seen, this one is my most favorite(Space Buddies & Spooky Buddies are a close 2nd & 3rd) With the exception of the villain, Jean-George, I love all the characters in the movie, especially the Buddies and Shasta.  Another thing I love about it is the messages that it delivers such as trying hard to be the best you can be and pay attention to wise advice. The plot is really neat, as well, where, because of Budderball's stomach, all the buddies end up in an ice cream shipment to a town in Alaska, where they met Shasta, an Alaskan husky, and his owner, Adam Bilson, who wants to be a dog-sled racer, just like his father was. So, the Buddies decide to help him fulfill his dream. Another thing I love is that the movie has some of the funniest lines, like when Rosebud introduces herself and her brothers to Shasta and he asks Mudbud ""Why do they call you Mudbud?"" & Mudbud looks at his reflection and says, ""I'm spotless! Think of a dirty place! Think of a dirty place!"" One last thing I love is the bonus features, especially the feature commentary with the Buddies and Shasta.
