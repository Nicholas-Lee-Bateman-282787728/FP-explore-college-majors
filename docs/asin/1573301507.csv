Mariah even lip-synch's on some of the tracks and her dancing is not great. The only performance I liked was her duet with Trey Lorenz on I'll Be There. This is Mariah's worst concert DVD ever!

Not to say the video isnt good, but it would have been nice to see a full concert, instead of performances from around the world. It would be nice to have the Rainbow Tour on VHS/DVD. Anyway, she sings a lot of her hits here, and there is also some bonus videos on the VHS, Butterfly and Breakdown, which are worth the price of this video alone. However once again DVD gets more extras, with extra videos for the two I listed, and as well My All and The Roof.

188331,A3ROZK0G84RGMZ,1573301507,IJustDiedAlive,"[2, 2]",We did when we bought all those Mariah albums.  I think we deserve better when it comes to Mariah performances on Dvd.  I mean they still haven't released The First Vision on dvd yet I don't think they ever will.  This concert has so much bad editing.  Let her sing one song all the way through at least once.  The only reason I gave this dvd five stars is because of the exclusive music videos.  The Roof and Breakdown are classic.  Swimming with the dolphins was also very cute.,5,Sony better recognize who lined thier pockets in the 90's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1151366400,"06 27, 2006",2006,480,"['did', 'when', 'bought', 'Mariah', 'albums', 'think', 'deserve', 'better', 'when', 'Mariah', 'performances', 'Dvd', 'mean', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'released', 'First', 'Vision', 'dvd', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'will', 'concert', 'so', 'much', 'bad', 'editing', 'Let', 'sing', 'one', 'song', 'way', 'least', 'once', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', 'dvd', 'five', 'stars', 'exclusive', 'music', 'videos', 'Roof', 'Breakdown', 'are', 'classic', 'Swimming', 'dolphins', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'cute']",Mariah Carey - Around the World
188332,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,1573301507,Marc Cabir Davis,"[0, 0]","Fans of Mariah are also critical of this DVD, and I am well aware of its shortcomings. The primary concern here is that they wanted to film Mariah literally ""All Around the World"", and the results are less than spectacular. I also had a problem with the song selection and the portions of stage banter they decided to include (Mariah in Australia for example - a huge portion of dialog wasn't very interesting even if you ARE a Mariah fan).The standout was definitely her performance of ""Fantasy"" with the ODB bit thrown in - some nice choreography here and Mariah actually dances. Its amazing to think she used to be this skinny! Also of importance is the performance with Olivia Newton John singing ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"". I'm in no way a fan of this overwrought song, but here it sounded pretty good and you can see the two genuinely like each other.But really, you shouldn't be getting this for the concert. What you should be looking forward to is owning the rare video for ""The Roof"" (a criminally underrated track off her ""Butterfly"" album). In fact, the entire DVD is from the 1997 ""Butterfly Era"", so you have the remaining videos (""Butterfly"", ""My All"" and of course the amazing ""Breakdown"" all included here). ""The Roof"" has NEVER BEEN ISSUED on DVD before, and wasn't aired much on TV either, so this is the only way to own it. I would say, this ranks as one of the best Mariah videos ever, so get it now.I still think the ultimate Mariah DVD is the 2007 release of her 1992 MTV Unplugged Concert, but considering the extras on this DVD, you can't quite go wrong.

But...(sigh) this one is simply disappointing. Mariah was changed in some ways especially in appearance, I  think. In most concerts here she seemed she tried to make them underwear  fashion shows and she danced like a third-rate stripper. I was watching  this DVD with my parents and totally embarrassed by her sultry look and  suggestive dances. She is so mean now. (Mariah, wake up and look around  yourself!) And I don't understand why the title is &quot;Around the  World&quot;. Are there only four countries in the world? I don't think so.  One more BIG problem with this video is many songs including &quot;My  All&quot; and &quot;I'll Be There&quot; were edited inappropriately to make  them very short(running around just 1 to 2.5 minutes). In particular,  &quot;Hopelessly Devoted To You&quot; with Olivia Newton-John was cut so  awkwardly(even make me laugh). I really don't understand this kind of  reckless editing.
