But for those who do not own the series on DVD, will enjoy the marginal upgrade for the video compared to its DVD counterpart and a pretty solid English lossless soundtrack.""Heroic Age: The Complete Series"" is not a perfect release but it's one of the top three series out there available on Blu-ray in the U.S. at this time.

1290258,AS77LVLUSX18R,B002UOMGW4,Roy Basilisk,"[40, 43]","Having just watched the full series of Heroic Age in its Blu-ray incarnation (it was only just released this month), I must give it a very strong recommendation.  Set in a world that essentially unites elements of Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, and with explicit influence from Greek mythology, the show is an obvious choice for fans of sci-fi spectacle.  Action fans will enjoy heavy-hitting, subwoofer friendly battles of often entertainingly absurd scale.  If planets and even galaxies could run and hide, they'd be advised to in Heroic Age.  But the show is also more than just bang and boom.Political intrigue and emotional underpinnings of the battles are never far from mind.  Many of the important players in the show are desperately looking for a way out of the violence and chaos, not reveling in it.  Two of four primary tribes (species) in the series have been set to battle each other, many confused by the meaning of contractual obligations (Labors) set before them, or rather to individual powerful beings ""assigned"" to them.  These two are the technologically sophisticated but blindly arrogant Silver Tribe, and the space-faring upstarts the Iron Tribe, our human race.  The Golden tribe is the one each aspires to find but which has also set them into galactic conflict.  The Bronze tribe is an insect-like tribe that works at the behest of whichever tribe has been granted control over them.  In this case, that would be the Silver tribe which uses them as front-line fodder against the Iron Tribe.Last but not in the slightest least, there are five dominant beings formerly of the Heroic tribe.  Four of them are under the thumb of the Silver tribe due either to contract or threats against their related homeworlds.  The fifth is within our titular hero, Age.Age is a young man of straightforward innocence found alone on a planet by Princess Dhianeila and a group of human space-farers who quickly discover his true power when he transmutes into the powerful being Belcross (a ""Nodos"") to single-handedly smite a planetary invading force of the Bronze tribe.With some comic relief early on as Age acclimates to his new-found friends, the show largely shifts to the aforementioned interstellar political wrangling and the mega-battles that usually ensue when not all players are interested in talking.  As such, for those looking for much in the way of relationships and interpersonal drama, it is there but kept largely secondary in this grand conflict.  There is some to be had such as whether the otherwise smart soldier Iolaous will ever see past his own dense infatuated loyalty to Dhianeila to recognize that her best friend and healer Aneasha is always there for him.  But keep in mind that this is a show in which even Age himself becomes at times tertiary to the wider conflict.As for the visual quality of the Blu-ray, the show is an upscale that benefits from great clarity of color and line and the constant and fast-paced action never suffers from compression issues.  Importantly, with a rare exception such as in a disc 3 episode with excessive banding, the wide expanses of space otherwise manage to be held crystal clear.Finally, the surround audio English track features universally solid voice acting and will rock your sound system during the many battles.  The English voice cast especially excels over the Japanese interpretations of these animated creations in the cases of Christopher Sabat and Lydia Mackay.  The former best defining the character of Karkinos and the latter of Prome O.",5,A great sci-fi spectacle that deserves more recognition,1266796800,"02 22, 2010",2010,3534,"['Having', 'just', 'watched', 'full', 'series', 'Heroic', 'Age', 'Blu-ray', 'incarnation', 'was', 'only', 'just', 'released', 'month', 'must', 'give', 'very', 'strong', 'recommendation', 'Set', 'world', 'essentially', 'elements', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'explicit', 'influence', 'Greek', 'mythology', 'show', 'obvious', 'choice', 'fans', 'sci-fi', 'spectacle', 'Action', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'heavy-hitting', 'subwoofer', 'friendly', 'battles', 'often', 'entertainingly', 'absurd', 'scale', 'planets', 'even', 'galaxies', 'could', 'run', 'hide', ""'d"", 'be', 'advised', 'Heroic', 'Age', 'show', 'also', 'more', 'just', 'bang', 'boom.Political', 'intrigue', 'emotional', 'underpinnings', 'battles', 'are', 'never', 'far', 'mind', 'Many', 'important', 'players', 'show', 'are', 'desperately', 'looking', 'way', 'violence', 'chaos', 'not', 'reveling', 'Two', 'four', 'primary', 'tribes', 'species', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'set', 'battle', 'other', 'many', 'confused', 'meaning', 'contractual', 'obligations', 'Labors', 'set', 'rather', 'individual', 'powerful', 'beings', 'assigned', 'two', 'are', 'technologically', 'sophisticated', 'blindly', 'arrogant', 'Silver', 'Tribe', 'space-faring', 'upstarts', 'Iron', 'Tribe', 'human', 'race', 'Golden', 'tribe', 'one', 'find', 'also', 'set', 'galactic', 'conflict', 'Bronze', 'tribe', 'insect-like', 'tribe', 'behest', 'whichever', 'tribe', 'been', 'granted', 'control', 'case', 'would', 'be', 'Silver', 'tribe', 'front-line', 'fodder', 'Iron', 'Tribe.Last', 'not', 'slightest', 'least', 'are', 'five', 'dominant', 'beings', 'formerly', 'Heroic', 'tribe', 'Four', 'are', 'thumb', 'Silver', 'tribe', 'due', 'either', 'contract', 'threats', 'related', 'homeworlds', 'fifth', 'titular', 'hero', 'Age.Age', 'young', 'man', 'straightforward', 'innocence', 'found', 'alone', 'planet', 'Princess', 'Dhianeila', 'group', 'human', 'space-farers', 'who', 'quickly', 'discover', 'true', 'power', 'when', 'powerful', 'being', 'Belcross', 'Nodos', 'single-handedly', 'smite', 'planetary', 'invading', 'force', 'Bronze', 'comic', 'relief', 'early', 'Age', 'new-found', 'friends', 'show', 'largely', 'shifts', 'aforementioned', 'interstellar', 'political', 'wrangling', 'mega-battles', 'usually', 'ensue', 'when', 'not', 'players', 'are', 'interested', 'talking', 'such', 'looking', 'much', 'way', 'relationships', 'interpersonal', 'drama', 'there', 'kept', 'largely', 'secondary', 'grand', 'conflict', 'be', 'had', 'such', 'otherwise', 'smart', 'soldier', 'Iolaous', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'own', 'dense', 'infatuated', 'loyalty', 'Dhianeila', 'recognize', 'best', 'friend', 'healer', 'Aneasha', 'always', 'keep', 'mind', 'show', 'even', 'Age', 'times', 'tertiary', 'wider', 'conflict.As', 'visual', 'quality', 'Blu-ray', 'show', 'upscale', 'benefits', 'great', 'clarity', 'color', 'line', 'constant', 'fast-paced', 'action', 'never', 'suffers', 'compression', 'issues', 'Importantly', 'rare', 'exception', 'such', 'disc', '3', 'episode', 'excessive', 'banding', 'wide', 'expanses', 'space', 'otherwise', 'manage', 'be', 'held', 'crystal', 'clear.Finally', 'surround', 'audio', 'English', 'track', 'features', 'universally', 'solid', 'voice', 'acting', 'will', 'rock', 'sound', 'system', 'many', 'battles', 'English', 'voice', 'cast', 'especially', 'excels', 'Japanese', 'interpretations', 'animated', 'creations', 'cases', 'Christopher', 'Sabat', 'Lydia', 'Mackay', 'former', 'best', 'defining', 'character', 'Karkinos', 'latter', 'Prome', 'O']",Heroic Age: The Complete Series
