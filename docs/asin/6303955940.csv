It stars John Ritter and Mary Page Keller (of Duet on FOX) as a family with kids that are seeking the perfect neighborhood.  After they move to their ""perfect"" neighborhood they find it is anything but paradise. Hal ""Barney Miller"" Linden plays the heavy in this one.  This a great flick; highly suspenseful with a pretty neat finale.  I think Hitch would have liked this one.  It really needs to be on DVD.NEW UPDATE! 21.Sept.07As pointed out below, if you subcribe to Comcast Digital Cable, ""The Colony"" is showing thru the month of November, 2007 on their ""ON DEMAND feature"" under the Free Movies tab.  If you are fortunate to have this option, now is the time to see this movie without commercials or embedded logos.

391895,AKMEY1BSHSDG7,6303955940,J. Arena,"[5, 5]","John Ritter is wonderful in this thriller about a family looking to escape the growing troubles of the world around them. Their very bright children are having trouble in school. The teenage daughter is so frustrated that she broke into the school's computer system and changed all her easy A's into failing grades -- now that's frustration! The final straw is the car-jacking and threatened sexual assault against the wife.When the offer comes to live in a gated community in houses that all look like ""hotels"" according to the young son, they are reluctant, but ultimately accept. However, the dream life soon turns -- slowly but surely -- into a nightmare.If you know anyone who has ever lived in a gated community, you know about the sometimes outrageous intrusions into your personal life. It can start with the color of your draperies, number of pets, types of plants -- and then takes off from there.Although this is certainly not a recent film, it is even more relavent today. How much freedom are you willing to give up to anyone, wether it is a homeowners organization or government? The Colony is very well done, and will make you question your own personal decisions on many levels.

Of course, beinga TV movie, there are sinister characters behind it, preventing anyonefrom leaving.
