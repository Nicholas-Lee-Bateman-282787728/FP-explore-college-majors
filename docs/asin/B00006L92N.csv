719951,A3EAFCZUVL6NZ9,B00006L92N,J. Marus,"[0, 1]",I didn't particularly care for the way they created the plot of the movie. It was very dragged out and hardly that much suspense. It was pretty much a boring film with such a great actor having to be driving all around the streets of the city which is basically what the whole film is. And you don't really see many characters and action until the ending when you finally see the crime boss that hardly appears at all in the film and the two henchmen that are out to get Vincent for not going through with torching his family's building.  The movie just didn't make that much sense to me and was very bland of plot an action movie. Could have been much better. I just give it 5 stars because I love Vincent Spano. He can take the worst film and make it fascinating with his gorgeous looks and talent charm.,5,5 Stars Only  Because Of Vincent Spano!,1350000000,"10 12, 2012",2012,806,"['did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'way', 'created', 'plot', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'dragged', 'out', 'hardly', 'much', 'suspense', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'boring', 'film', 'great', 'actor', 'having', 'be', 'driving', 'streets', 'city', 'basically', 'what', 'whole', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'many', 'characters', 'action', 'ending', 'when', 'finally', 'see', 'crime', 'boss', 'hardly', 'film', 'two', 'henchmen', 'are', 'out', 'get', 'Vincent', 'not', 'going', 'torching', 'family', 'building', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'was', 'very', 'bland', 'plot', 'action', 'movie', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'just', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'love', 'Vincent', 'Spano', 'can', 'take', 'worst', 'film', 'make', 'fascinating', 'gorgeous', 'looks', 'talent', 'charm']",N/A

719954,A27MOT4ZIUAKIW,B00006L92N,The Jaundiced Eye,"[8, 14]","These comments are directed at the movie itself, as a review should be, and not at the service from Amazon or the pretty colors of the DVD label, etc. etc.This movie is often shown late at night on free TV channels along with a bunch of other really lousy movies featuring titles and actors you never heard of. At the time I wrote this review, it was available for $3.98 from Amazon. How much more evidence do you need indicating just how lousy it is? The acting is amateurish, the plot is absurd, the background music and noise are reminiscent of a garage band playing in a noisy factory, and every scene is clouded in heavy smoke, possibly to conceal the complete lack of production values. Run down old buildings are inexplicably bathed in brightly colored pink, blue, and violet lights, making each of the many, many wide shots look like a trip to Disneyland. This is in direct opposition to the tough, gritty atmosphere that the director should create, and typical of the overall silliness of this production.There are a million reasons why this movie is a waste of time, and I won't bore you with any more. Simply consider the evidence above, save your $3.98, and if you just can't live without seeing just how bad it is: drink lots of coffee and stay up late, tuned to one of those grade-Z TV channels that shows lousy, cheap old movies all night.....and you can suffer through this truly awful production for free.
