And I definitely wasn't disappointed. In fact I watched it 3 times the first night. I'm a sucker for bass singers so of course I love Willie ""Sugar Bear"" Ford. And L. J. Reynolds still sounds great. If you're a 70's soul fan this is one for you.",5,The Dramatics Biggest Hits Live is wonderful!,1289260800,"11 9, 2010",2010,379,"[""'m"", 'fan', '70', 'music', 'naturally', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Dramatics', 'years', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'find', 'concert', 'dvd', 'definitely', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'fact', 'watched', '3', 'times', 'first', 'night', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'bass', 'singers', 'so', 'course', 'love', 'Willie', 'Sugar', 'Bear', 'Ford', 'L.', 'J.', 'Reynolds', 'still', 'great', ""'re"", '70', 'soul', 'fan', 'one']",Biggest Hits Live

They can't sustain that magic that was once there.

1216118,ACHX77Z6FHIUX,B001M5M7DK,"Music Video Lover ""Music Video Lover""","[0, 1]","When I purchased this dvd, I thought I was purchasing a dvd displaying the original Dramatics -- I especially thought that Lenny Mayes would be on this one even though it showed the Dramatics in later years, but he was not.  This dvd is a sad remembrance of the once-famous Dramatics -- Ron Banks could not even hold a note anymore, much less sing!  He was shown on the dvd HOLDING ON TO AND LEANING AGAINST THE MICROPHONE while the others were trying to sing and dance because he was out of breath and could not keep up!  Sadly, he died one year later -- he shouldn't have been singing in this dvd (in 2009)-- you could clearly see that he was out of shape and out of the loop! They all looked like they had not saved their money and had been on the streets, drinking and drugging it for years.  Overall, their performance was a ""D"" to say the least.  The once-famous Dramatics' songs are too special to have displayed this dvd to the world, showing the the aged replacements and the out-in-the-streets original singers that are left.  This dvd should not have cost any more than $2.99 even though I paid $17.99 for it because their songs were so wonderful.  Please don't bother wasting your money on this dvd.  If you want to remember the Dramatics, I would suggest that you continue to listen to their old albums and CDs and catch their tunes on your local radio station.  I'll give it two stars ""just because.""",2,Very Disappointing,1306281600,"05 25, 2011",2011,1414,"['When', 'purchased', 'dvd', 'thought', 'was', 'purchasing', 'dvd', 'displaying', 'original', 'Dramatics', 'especially', 'thought', 'Lenny', 'Mayes', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'even', 'showed', 'Dramatics', 'later', 'years', 'was', 'not', 'dvd', 'sad', 'remembrance', 'once-famous', 'Dramatics', 'Ron', 'Banks', 'could', 'not', 'even', 'hold', 'note', 'anymore', 'much', 'less', 'sing', 'was', 'shown', 'dvd', 'HOLDING', 'ON', 'TO', 'AND', 'LEANING', 'AGAINST', 'THE', 'MICROPHONE', 'others', 'were', 'trying', 'sing', 'dance', 'was', 'breath', 'could', 'not', 'keep', 'up', 'Sadly', 'died', 'one', 'year', 'later', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'singing', 'dvd', '2009', 'could', 'clearly', 'see', 'was', 'shape', 'loop', 'looked', 'had', 'not', 'saved', 'money', 'had', 'been', 'streets', 'drinking', 'drugging', 'years', 'Overall', 'performance', 'was', 'D', 'say', 'least', 'once-famous', 'Dramatics', 'songs', 'are', 'too', 'special', 'have', 'displayed', 'dvd', 'world', 'showing', 'aged', 'replacements', 'out-in-the-streets', 'original', 'singers', 'are', 'left', 'dvd', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'cost', 'more', '2.99', 'even', 'paid', '17.99', 'songs', 'were', 'so', 'wonderful', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'wasting', 'money', 'dvd', 'want', 'remember', 'Dramatics', 'would', 'suggest', 'continue', 'listen', 'old', 'albums', 'CDs', 'catch', 'tunes', 'local', 'radio', 'station', ""'ll"", 'give', 'two', 'just']",Biggest Hits Live
1216119,A1MUJJALKSI7P4,B001M5M7DK,N. Brown,"[16, 16]","As noted in my prior reviews, I have been a music collector for the past 30 years, especially classic music, and this includes classic video performances by legendary artists, which are very hard to find because most of the ones available are very poor in quality due to a lack of restoration/conversion.  In this case, the Dramatics concert is of relatively good quality in picture and sound (unless you are an audio/video tech fanatic),and the group performs literally all of their greatest hits, although some in a melody format because they have so many hits.  The concert itself is actually very good if you like the Dramatics.  I attended several of their live concerts and this is not a bad representation at all.  Of course they are somewhat older, and all artists lose some vocal ability in time, but overall they are in pretty good voice for their ages.  That said, I would recommend this concert for any true Dramatics fans, as it is likely the last good performance you will find, and I think it is a nice addition to my vast collection of classic music!",4,Nice Dramtatics Concert!,1255046400,"10 9, 2009",2009,1066,"['noted', 'prior', 'reviews', 'have', 'been', 'music', 'collector', 'past', '30', 'years', 'especially', 'classic', 'music', 'classic', 'video', 'performances', 'legendary', 'artists', 'are', 'very', 'hard', 'find', 'most', 'ones', 'available', 'are', 'very', 'poor', 'quality', 'due', 'lack', 'restoration/conversion', 'case', 'Dramatics', 'concert', 'relatively', 'good', 'quality', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'audio/video', 'tech', 'fanatic', 'group', 'literally', 'greatest', 'hits', 'melody', 'format', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'hits', 'concert', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'like', 'Dramatics', 'attended', 'several', 'live', 'concerts', 'not', 'bad', 'representation', 'course', 'are', 'somewhat', 'older', 'artists', 'lose', 'vocal', 'ability', 'time', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'voice', 'ages', 'said', 'would', 'recommend', 'concert', 'true', 'Dramatics', 'fans', 'likely', 'last', 'good', 'performance', 'will', 'find', 'think', 'nice', 'addition', 'vast', 'collection', 'classic', 'music']",Biggest Hits Live
