It took some dramatic license and stereotyped aspects of particular characters, but most of the characters were believable. One big drawback was the beginning of season 2 when two central characters were killed off through questionable circumstances. This did open the way for the introduction of an incompetent handler with whom Darwin has nothing but trouble for the remainder of the season. That was too predictable. The introduction of moral issues with some of the characters was an interesting and often untried plot line in shows like this.

1037455,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B000L43PGQ,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[6, 9]","- REVIEWDarwyn Al-Kareem (Michael Ealy) was having a crazy year when he infiltrated a terrorist cell who attempted to blow up a stadium in L.A.; the individuals of the cell was either killed or missing, and the leader of the group, Farik (Odeh Fehr), was imprisoned and is under serious interrogation.  Although Darwyn is taking his sweet vacation, while being with his lover Gayle and sporting a new haircut that doesn't make him look like the guy from ""C.S.I."", soon he will be playing his role once again, and he'll soon figure out that there's a lot at stake on his new mission.In ""Sleeper Cell: American Terror"", Darwyn will once again go undercover as a member of a new terrorist cell and, once again, comprises of a variety of Islamic individuals: Salim, an British-speaking Iraqi with a dark secret (who strangely reminds me DJ Qualls); Mina, a Dutch-prostitute-turned-babysitter; and Hispanic gangster Benito.  Under circumstances, Darwyn not only goes undercover, he becomes the leader of the cell members.  Through the second Youmud Din, he faces challenges that go against him.  Not only must he control the members of the cell from their personal agendas, he must deal with a new case agent named Russell, who's a by-the-book agent that interferes with Darwyn's plan and his personal love life.  And this was all before Farik escapes from prison with his own agendas in mind.Once again, the cast are just as great as in the first mini-series, if only with a bother or two.  Ealy continues to perceive a struggling character playing both sides, and he does a great job showing it, especially in his worst scenarios.  Fehr is equally impressive as a charming but corruptive terrorist.  Neither of these characters, despite their opposite sides, have anything to cheer or jeer about; they're characters acting out of principles.  That is what makes the cast work so well, just as much with the members of the new cell.  The actors playing Salim and Mina give an accurate performance of how their unique perspectives of Islam face against the commercialization and modern views of the American world.  Although I didn't care for them as much as the previous cell, the cell members remain to be shocked as to how normal their lives are when they aren't on a mission.The cast should be applauded for their acting, but I personally have a soft spot for Henri Lubatti as Ilija, but only because I respect him as a ""Tribe Called Quest"" fan.  It was funny to see the runaway right-hand man of Farik with his hair bleached, but I was moved for that one scene where he thought he had to make a tough, emotional choice in order to survive, and to see him eventually pay for his choice was heartbreaking.  Believe me, there are PLENTY of heart-breaking moments in ""American Terror.""I was disappointed with one of the cell members, Benito (or Benny as he calls himself).  It's not that he's a bad character, and the actor playing him was solid, but there weren't many screen-times with this guy.  There are plenty of scenes where I get to know more on Salim and Mina's personal lives, but not so much with Benito and how he's doing in his spare time.  By the time the big break-out comes in, he just comes and goes.  Jay R. Ferguson's role as Case Agent Russell is just plain unlikable, and though he's suppose to be an unlikable character, I think he overcompensate himself with his role.Although the episodes are shockingly good, only episode five comes off as the weak of the bunch.  The episode covers the issue with how black people are treated by the government, as discussed within scenes between Darwyn and his father.  I don't mind discussions like that, but in a show about terrorism, it doesn't completely work and it feels out of place.  What's more unnecessary is the ridiculous scene where Mina is being threatened by the father of whose kids she's babysitting, so he can seduce her or else she's going to lose her job.  She should've walked away from that situation, she knows she's not going to last long when the terrorist act begins anyway, but she has to give a big speech about her position and such, all because she loves the kids.  Of course it all worked out for her, but come on.""Sleeper Cell: American Terror"" avoids the trappings of ""more of the same"" sequels by having the consequences from the result of the first mini-series.  The second mini-series might have the same purpose with the same inevitable breakthrough, but the results are different and even more devastation on Darwyn's part.  In fact, his involvement will take away those he protects the most, and face the ultimate path that goes against his code.The eight-episode season might be short, but it definitely hasn't softened or rushed the impact from the previous mini-series.  In fact, it only gets worse, and that's a great thing about the show that delves into the realistic perspectives of Islam and the war on terror.  Showtime made the right call at giving another ""Sleeper Cell"" mini-series, and a remarkable one at that.  It bugs me to know that ""American Terror"" ended in a cliff-hanger of sorts, but at least I can look forward to its third mini-series...as long as Showtime doesn't pull a ""Carnivale"" and cancel it outright.This is Del Keyes, saying ""The enemy is here to stay.""",4,Woeful paths to God's Paradise,1166745600,"12 22, 2006",2006,5280,"['REVIEWDarwyn', 'Al-Kareem', 'Michael', 'Ealy', 'was',

1037460,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000L43PGQ,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[24, 25]","After reading some initially moderate reviews of the first season of ""Sleeper Cell"", I tuned into Showtime with minimal expectations.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by an efficient, nicely acted, and timely thriller.  I became a big supporter of the show, and felt that it was much better than a lot of people gave it credit for--and eventually it was recognized with some accolades (an Emmy nomination for best miniseries among others).So, I went into ""Sleeper Cell - American Terror"" with greater expectations.  While, ultimately, I don't feel as if was as taut and exciting as the first season--it is still an intriguing and serious minded look at the world of terrorism.  The show essentially revolves around Michael Ealy as Darwyn, an African-American Muslim who is also an undercover FBI agent.  He thwarted an attack on Dodger Stadium in ""Sleeper Cell.""  The show picks up with months after that incident with Darwyn looking to distance himself from field work and live quietly with his girlfriend.  As a horrific fate befalls his previous handler, he is called back into action to help stop a current and impending threat.  Using his previous connections, he not only joins a new cell--but eventually becomes its leader.  With an inexperienced handler, he often has to go rogue in order to maintain his credibility within the cell.  In concurrent storylines, we follow two other members of last season's cast--Farik, the mastermind of the Dodger stadium attack and another ""soldier.""Farik, a great and believable villain, is a bit underutilized here--but Oded Fehr makes him a powerful presence.  The action is filmed around the globe, and the scope of the show is ambitious and impressive.  I actually liked the members of the new cell, and thought the characterizations were surprisingly detailed.  Far from stereotypes, you learn about them as individuals.  This definitely raises the stakes.  I did, however, think the show lacked some of the propulsive narrative drive necessary to make this absolutely unmissable entertainment.  The interplay between Darwyn and his new handler is pretty forced and not particularly believable.  It's conflict added for the sake of conflict.  But once again (as in Season one), the character that threatens to derail the show is Darwyn's girlfriend.  She is incorporated into the action unnecessarily and tediously (she does work for the FBI to conveniently thwart a custody action from her son's grandparents).  It's not credible, nor interesting or well played.I do recommend ""American Terror,"" however.  I do like that the show doesn't shy away from real consequences and real tragedy.  An insightful look, the show is further distinguished by an ethically questionable ending and an ambiguous final shot.  I admired that the show wasn't wrapped up in nobility--for to give this a tidy ending would have been a compromise not worthy of the serious and complex topic.

1037462,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000L43PGQ,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[8, 10]","The producers made some interesting choices for the second season of ""Sleeper Cell: American Terror"" in that when Muslim FBI agent Darwyn Al-Sayeed (Michael Ealy) is sent on his next deep undercover mission the show is still following the other members of the first season's cell who also survived.  Farik (Oded Fehr) has been captured and is being interrogated by the American government, while Ilija Korjenic (Henri Lubatti) makes his way back to his Europe to visit his homeland of Bosnia.  Darwyn is trying to start a new life with Gayle Bishop (Melissa Sagemiller), but ends up back in another L.A. sleeper cell.  Adding insult to injury, Darwyn ends up with a new FBI handler, Agent Warren Russell (Jay R. Ferguson), who would have to work really hard just to be an idiot.  There is no doubt that this clown is going to get people killed.A turn of events makes Darwyn the leader of the new sleeper cell, which consists of Salim (Omid Abtahi), an Iraqi ex-patriot raised in the U.K., Beeny Velazquez (Kevin Alejandro), a member of a Latino gang who became an extremist in prison, and Mina (Thekla Reuten), a Dutch woman converted to Islam by her late husband.  Initially Darwin is supposed to get his hands on a missile, but then the cell is ordered to get their hands on nuclear material.  Meanwhile, Farik is standing up to his interrogation, forcing the Americans to send him back to Saudi Arabia where the laws on torture are quite different.  For the most part during season two it is Farik who is the most interesting character and I think you have to root for him not to break as he is interrogated and tortured despite the fact he is the villain of the piece.  This is not just because the torturing escalates to a point beyond what most people would approve, but because of the insults and attacks directed towards his religious beliefs.  After all, although their interpretations are radically different, Farik and Darwyn share the same faith and one of the strengths of ""Sleeper Cell"" is that Darwyn remains true to both his beliefs and his country as his does his job.  Couple this plot line with the posturing and actions of Agent Russell and it is like the world has been turned upside down in these eight episodes.The obvious point of comparison for ""Sleeper Cell"" in terms of contemporary American television programming is ""24.""  The key thing that they have in common is that sometimes the bad guys win; it might not be anything major, but hundreds if not thousands of people get killed.  The biggest difference between the two series is that ""Sleeper Cell"" is more grounded in the real world while ""24"" revels in hyperbole and pouring it on from start to finish.  For me the final episode ended up being problematic because it throws away a lot of the strengths of the series.  I was pretty sure I knew what Darwyn was setting up and the problem was not just that I was right (because I like to be right), but that it becomes one of those moments where the hero gives off the great one liner.  True, the one liner is from the Qur'an, but Darwyn is such the strong silent type that pretty much anything he says is not as effect as when he levels his stare on people (or pops them one on the jaw).  If that were not enough the show suddenly regresses to something like ""Gunsmoke,"" and I just do not like ""Sleeper Cell"" appealing to my baser instincts.  This series is at its best when Darwyn is walking the tightrope and at the end of this season he jumps off it to get down and dirty.",4,"A lot of collateral damage in the second season of ""Sleeper Cell""",1175299200,"03 31, 2007",2007,3507,"['producers', 'made', 'interesting', 'choices', 'second', 'season', 'Sleeper', 'Cell', 'American', 'Terror', 'when', 'Muslim', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Darwyn', 'Al-Sayeed', 'Michael', 'Ealy', 'sent', 'next', 'deep', 'undercover', 'mission', 'show', 'still', 'following', 'other', 'members', 'first', 'season', 'cell', 'who', 'also', 'survived', 'Farik', 'Oded', 'Fehr', 'been', 'captured', 'being', 'interrogated', 'American', 'government', 'Ilija', 'Korjenic', 'Henri', 'Lubatti', 'way', 'back', 'Europe', 'visit', 'homeland', 'Bosnia', 'Darwyn', 'trying', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'Gayle', 'Bishop', 'Melissa', 'Sagemiller', 'up', 'back', 'L.A.', 'sleeper', 'cell', 'Adding', 'insult', 'injury', 'Darwyn', 'up', 'new', 'FBI', 'handler', 'Agent', 'Warren', 'Russell', 'Jay', 'R.', 'Ferguson', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'work', 'really', 'hard', 'just', 'be', 'idiot', 'doubt', 'clown', 'going', 'get', 'people', 'killed.A', 'turn', 'events', 'Darwyn', 'leader', 'new', 'sleeper', 'cell', 'Salim', 'Omid', 'Abtahi', 'Iraqi', 'ex-patriot', 'raised', 'U.K.', 'Beeny', 'Velazquez', 'Kevin', 'Alejandro', 'member', 'Latino', 'gang', 'who', 'became', 'extremist', 'prison', 'Mina', 'Thekla', 'Reuten', 'Dutch', 'woman', 'converted', 'Islam', 'late', 'husband', 'Initially', 'Darwin', 'supposed', 'get', 'hands', 'missile', 'then', 'cell', 'ordered', 'get', 'hands', 'nuclear', 'material', 'Meanwhile', 'Farik', 'standing', 'up', 'interrogation', 'forcing', 'Americans', 'send', 'back', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'where', 'laws', 'torture', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'most', 'part', 'season', 'two', 'Farik', 'who', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'think', 'have', 'root', 'not', 'break', 'interrogated', 'tortured', 'fact', 'villain', 'piece', 'not', 'just', 'torturing', 'escalates', 'point', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'approve', 'insults', 'attacks', 'directed', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'interpretations', 'are', 'radically', 'different', 'Farik', 'Darwyn', 'share', 'same', 'faith', 'one', 'strengths', 'Sleeper', 'Cell', 'Darwyn', 'true', 'beliefs', 'country', 'job', 'Couple', 'plot', 'line', 'posturing', 'actions', 'Agent', 'Russell', 'world', 'been', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'eight', 'episodes.The', 'obvious', 'point', 'comparison', 'Sleeper', 'Cell', 'terms', 'contemporary', 'American', 'television', 'programming', '24', 'key', 'thing', 'have', 'common', 'sometimes', 'bad', 'guys', 'win', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'anything', 'major', 'hundreds', 'not', 'thousands', 'people', 'get', 'killed', 'biggest', 'difference', 'two', 'series', 'Sleeper', 'Cell', 'more', 'grounded', 'real', 'world', '24', 'revels', 'hyperbole', 'pouring', 'start', 'finish', 'final', 'episode', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'problematic', 'away', 'lot', 'strengths', 'series', 'was', 'pretty', 'sure', 'knew', 'what', 'Darwyn', 'was', 'setting', 'up', 'problem', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'was', 'right', 'like', 'be', 'right', 'one', 'moments', 'where', 'hero', 'great', 'one', 'liner', 'True', 'one', 'liner', ""Qur'an"", 'Darwyn', 'such', 'strong', 'silent', 'type', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything', 'not', 'as', 'effect', 'when', 'levels', 'stare', 'people', 'pops', 'one', 'jaw', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'show', 'suddenly', 'something', 'Gunsmoke', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'Sleeper', 'Cell', 'appealing', 'baser', 'instincts', 'series', 'best', 'when', 'Darwyn', 'walking', 'tightrope', 'end', 'season', 'get', 'down', 'dirty']",Sleeper Cell - American Terror - The Complete Second Season
