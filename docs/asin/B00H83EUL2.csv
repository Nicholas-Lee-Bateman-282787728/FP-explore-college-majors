1684741,A3AYYRWQB4ZSJV,B00H83EUL2,,"[0, 1]","Apparently the new innovative 3D technique used in this film is what drove the popularity and Oscars success. Viewing it in 2D left only the CGI and acting to show, and in that regard the movie is good, but not great. George Clooney dies way too early, leaving only Sandra Bullock to finish the film. There are no other actors/actresses in this film, unless you count the dead fellow crew members who only show up as cadavers after the initial debris strike. There is only a voice from ground control in the beginning, and that too disappears after tragedy strikes. The audio is unremarkable, no loud explosions from the debris strikes, apparently simulating the effect that there is no sound in space. I would have preferred a fictional account of loud sounds through my sound system to help me enjoy it. It must have been slim pickings this year at the Oscars.",3,"Helps if you're a Sandra Bullock fan.

Unfortunately a disaster occurs destroying their only ride back to earth and now attached to each other, they must make it to the International Space Station as their only hope to get home safely. Disaster after disaster strikes and Dr. Ryan, who in the beginning appears to be withdrawn and a somewhat sad and lonely woman, finds strength she did not know she had. The last half of the movie is strictly Sandra and proves why she is an Oscar winner. She is a strong personality that can carry just about any storyline if it is written and directed well. My opinion, she should have won the Oscar, hands down. And while I like George Clooney, he was good in the supporting role as aging astronaut because Sandra Bullock was beside him. I did however wish the director and/or writer would have made it a bit more realistic when it came to the antics he(Kowalski) pulls while Dr. Ryan attempts to fix the board on the satellite.

As mentioned before, sound inside the helmet gave realism, but when the ISS breaks up, and the initial impacts - may have expected less in the way of mood music to ruin the realism.Bullock getting out of the suit on her own at speed... takes 2 people, and longer than 30 seconds.Air locks with outside locks and controls. Not so much.Bullock in a top and shorts inside a spacesuit. No temperature regulation via the full-body liquid cooled suit then? Or adult diaper?The fire extinguisher. No. Just no.Overall, it was a good movie.

If you know anything about physics, this movie will drive you nuts with the implausible situations that are depicted from the start to the end of the movie. The complete opening of the movie is implausible- the colliding satellites arent in the same orbital altitude as the space station- the astronauts would have hours, days, or weeks notice the dibris would reach them- all sorts of solutions could be employed to keep the astronauts safe. The plot would have collapsed right there. The physics of bodies in space acted on by external forces dont behave as depicted in the movie in almost every case. The psychology of the astronauts werent very realistic, either- people wont make it to astronaut statust if they can't remain calm and sort through multiple life and death technical problems before they EVER go to space. As smart as Sandra Bullock's character might have been, there would be little to no liklihood that she could reprogram a Russian spacecraft's system to make it into a lifeboat. The CGI is spectacular, but the director should have budgeted funds for some technical experts to guide the movie such that the foolish storyline could have been avoided. My impression is the director didnt likebeing told his storyline was juvenile and stubbornly was going to make the movie his way. This is a dollar movie- dont waste your money on buying a copy of it.

The story of Mission Specialist Dr. Ryan Stone (&#34;what kind of name is that for a girl?&#34;) is one of loss, but also of finally realizing that, even after suffering a devastating grief, her life is worth living, and finally, is wanted. Watching Stone's journey from paralyzing fear to courage and will is riveting, despite being essentially a one-woman show.  George Clooney's calm, rational portrayal of astronaut Matt Kowalski is understated and underrated, in my opinion.  In his brief time onscreen, he shows us exactly what Jonathan Frakes spent seven years trying to achieve in Commander Riker - a highly trained, highly competent, even gifted leader, yet one with an easy charm and sense of humor.  The character's absolute command of a terrifying situation was both believable and remarkable, and it is his calm that allows Stone to dig deep for her own resources.While the science may be sketchy, you will marvel, wondering, How did they film this?  If you don't, you either work in the film industry, or you are a rocket scientist. In the end, though, it isn't the science that's important.  It's traveling at 18,000 miles per hour around an ever-closer Earth with a frightened woman who must answer the question we all ask ourselves: If I knew this was my last day to live, how would I face it?

But there is so much to write about it that I cannot stop at one line.Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission,"" says astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) as he continues to joke around cruising around in jetpacks 370 miles above earth. The first scenes are incredible as the planet earth lies beneath the space shuttle while three engineers Dr. Ryan Stone ( Sandra Bullock) are tethered to it while doing patch up work on the Hubble telescope while talking to mission control played by Ed Harris- the sound effects on the dialogues are incredible.Planet Earth never looked so beautiful and so is the long shot of the space shuttle slowly edging on to view and in 3D, one can feel the isolation, stillness and the soundlessness of space.I have yet to see the making of the movie and I will but I think it would be a lot of people spending countless hours on special effects.Gravity is a science fiction film with many scientific inaccuracies,  for example although Russians and Chinese have their space missions in roughly the same locality as the US missions it is not easy to get to their missions in space with jetpacks as shown in the film. There are other doubtable scenes but most people would hardly care for these inaccuracies as the magic is in the presentation about space and also about human loss and pain, isolation, the futility of life and in the perseverance to fight for its last breath.I was surprised to find myself reacting so strongly at many moments in the film, even though the movie is only 131 minutes long......it keeps you in its grip for the entire duration suspended in gravity and riveted by the disaster that unfolds before your eyes. The happenings strike you again and again and stay with you.As debris from a Russian space explosion hurls towards them, they are asked by mission control to abort their task and get back into the shuttle. As disaster strikes leaving people dead and leaving Stone and Kowalski stranded in space- the special effects are just amazing here.I am not going to tell you what happens from this point but will point out that amidst the background of the CGI effects is the most moving human performance by Sandra Bullock. Just watch her in the communication with a greenlandic fisherman named on Earth's surface,  using a ham radio and feel tears coming out of your eyes...or in the final scenes. A performance of a lifetime.

After a Russian missile strike destroys a satellite, a cloud of debris in orbit is created. The debris strikes their Shuttle destroying it leaving only Stone and Kowalski alive and without any safe way to return to Earth. Their mission becomes one of survival.The film features fantastic visual effects that give the viewer the sense that they are floating along with the action in the movie. When watching the film, you really get the sense of the beauty of Earth from orbit. The filmmakers also took great care to depict the microgravity of space in a realistic fashion as the astronaut characters float around on spacewalks or inside spacecraft.Sandra Bullock does an excellent job of bringing her character to life as she overcomes adversity.The film is also a real treat for those who like some science with their science fiction. The movie, which has been praised by scientists and astronauts, tries to stick to real-life facts when possible. This includes depiction of real-life spacecraft, such as the Space Shuttle, the International Space Station, and the Soyuz, correctly depicting that there is no sound in space, and realistic depictions of weightlessness. Some liberties are taken such as ignoring the realities of orbital mechanics.This 2-disc DVD set also contains hours of fascinating bonus features mostly focusing on the making of the movie and how cutting edge technology was used to pull off the numerous visual effects in the film.I thought this was excellent film.

1684815,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00H83EUL2,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 8]","Sometimes it is hard to separate your true feelings for a film and the bountiful opinions of other, more vocal critics.  Walking into &#8216;Gravity&#8217;, I was nearly set up for sheer disappointment.  The buzz surrounding the film and the near unanimous raves for it made it appear to be one of those overhyped gargantuan films that leave the viewer with nowhere to go but down.  That was my biggest fear tonight, that I was going to wind up feeling betrayed by the early ink and ultimately have my theater experience dampened.&#8216;Gravity&#8217; does not disappoint.I don&#8217;t really know where to start, or even how to construct this review at all.  There is hardly anyway to spoil the film for someone who hasn&#8217;t seen it.  The only real question that one will have walking in is whether or not Sandra Bullock&#8217;s character dies, and I&#8217;m not about to reveal that answer, but outside of that there isn&#8217;t anything I can say that will lessen the impact of the film itself.  The fact remains that this film is a thrill ride from start to finish and that it uses the most of every single frame in play, milking each scene for optimum effect.  The plot is simple.  Debris from an accidental missile attack sends waves of danger to a group of astronauts and essentially causes a lot of issues for the initial impacts sole survivor, Doctor Ryan Stone.  This initial wave of debris hits about ten minutes into the movie and from that point forward, the impact is felt.  It ripples from frame to frame, scene to scene, like the monstrous approach of a tsunami.My hand hurts, because my wife was squeezing it for the entire ninety minutes.Heaps of praise have been shovels upon the film&#8217;s director, Alfonso Cuaron, and the star, Sandra Bullock, and that praise is deserved one-hundred fold.  Cuaron is a visionary director, one that understands the fabric of film and how to present it in a way that transports you.  I saw this in &#8216;Children of Men&#8217;, and he does it again here, to possibly even greater effect.  Every aspect of this movie is presented in a way that entices the senses.  From the remarkable imagery (the way that empty space is captured here is breathtaking) to the effective use of sound (and lack thereof), &#8216;Gravity&#8217; completely takes over your body.It lives in you.In all honesty, I left the theater feeling like my senses had been heightened.  Sound was much crisper and the air around me was much clearer.  It affected me physically, which is something I never expected.My hat truly goes off to Sandra Bullock though.  Without her dedicated performance, this film would have failed miserably.  As much as this is about the technical aspect of things, and as much as this is Cuaron&#8217;s movie, Bullock had a lot on her shoulders, and she makes this movie so incredibly human and intimate despite the grandeur of it all.  From an outside perspective, it may appear that she has nothing to do but panic (and she does a lot of that), but she slowly yet surely develops a beautifully fleshed out character who embodies the core themes of this film; namely the very will to survive.  Her solemn confession about her daughter paints a dark picture almost upfront, but she chips away at that density the reveal a woman renewed by her bleak circumstances to find the will to live again.  The film uses her (and she in turn uses to film) to completely flip the direness of it all on its head to unveil an uplifted spirit and delivers to the audience one of the most engrossing tales of internal and external survival I&#8217;ve ever seen put to film.Many critics have already heralded this as a masterpiece.  This year is so rich already, and I&#8217;ve only seen a handful of films, but I won&#8217;t hesitate to thrust that label on this film.  It truly is a marvelous piece of art, and it is easily the best film I&#8217;ve seen so far this year.  The great thing about &#8216;Gravity&#8217; is that it isn&#8217;t just a masterpiece in a singular aspect, but from every angle this film is nearly perfect.",5,"Breathtaking, literally&#8230;",1389484800,"01 12, 2014",2014,4071,"['Sometimes', 'hard', 'separate', 'true', 'feelings', 'film', 'bountiful', 'opinions', 'other', 'more', 'vocal', 'critics', 'Walking', '8216', 'Gravity', '8217', 'was', 'nearly', 'set', 'up', 'sheer', 'disappointment', 'buzz', 'surrounding', 'film', 'near', 'unanimous', 'raves', 'made', 'appear', 'be', 'one', 'overhyped', 'gargantuan', 'films', 'leave', 'viewer', 'nowhere', 'go', 'down', 'was', 'biggest', 'fear', 'tonight', 'was', 'going', 'wind', 'up', 'feeling', 'betrayed', 'early', 'ink', 'ultimately', 'have', 'theater', 'experience', 'dampened.', '8216', 'Gravity', '8217', 'not', 'disappoint.I', 'don', '8217', 'really', 'know', 'where', 'start', 'even', 'how', 'construct', 'review', 'hardly', 'anyway', 'spoil', 'film', 'someone', 'who', 'hasn', '8217', 'seen', 'only', 'real', 'question', 'one', 'will', 'have', 'walking', 'not', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', '8217', 's', 'character', 'dies', '8217', 'not', 'reveal', 'answer', 'isn', '8217', 'anything', 'can', 'say', 'will', 'lessen', 'impact', 'film', 'fact', 'film', 'thrill', 'ride', 'start', 'finish', 'most', 'single', 'frame', 'play', 'milking', 'scene', 'optimum', 'effect', 'plot', 'simple', 'Debris', 'accidental', 'missile', 'attack', 'waves', 'danger', 'group', 'astronauts', 'essentially', 'lot', 'issues', 'initial', 'impacts', 'sole', 'survivor', 'Doctor', 'Ryan', 'Stone', 'initial', 'wave', 'debris', 'hits', 'ten', 'minutes', 'movie', 'point', 'forward', 'impact', 'felt', 'frame', 'frame', 'scene', 'scene', 'monstrous', 'approach', 'tsunami.My', 'hand', 'hurts', 'wife', 'was', 'squeezing', 'entire', 'ninety', 'minutes.Heaps', 'praise', 'have', 'been', 'shovels', 'film', '8217', 'director', 'Alfonso', 'Cuaron', 'star', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'praise', 'deserved', 'one-hundred', 'fold', 'Cuaron', 'visionary', 'director', 'one', 'fabric', 'film', 'how', 'present', 'way', 'saw', '8216', 'Children', 'Men', '8217', 'again', 'here', 'possibly', 'even', 'greater', 'effect', 'aspect', 'movie', 'presented', 'way', 'senses', 'remarkable', 'imagery', 'way', 'empty', 'space', 'captured', 'here', 'breathtaking', 'effective', 'use', 'sound', 'lack', 'thereof', '8216', 'Gravity', '8217', 'completely', 'body.It', 'lives', 'you.In', 'honesty', 'left', 'theater', 'feeling', 'senses', 'had', 'been', 'heightened', 'Sound', 'was', 'much', 'crisper', 'air', 'was', 'much', 'clearer', 'affected', 'physically', 'something', 'never', 'expected.My', 'hat', 'truly', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'dedicated', 'performance', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'failed', 'miserably', 'As', 'much', 'technical', 'aspect', 'things', 'as', 'much', 'Cuaron', '8217', 's', 'movie', 'Bullock', 'had', 'lot', 'shoulders', 'movie', 'so', 'incredibly', 'human', 'intimate', 'grandeur', 'outside', 'perspective', 'may', 'appear', 'nothing', 'do', 'panic', 'lot', 'slowly', 'yet', 'surely', 'beautifully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'character', 'who', 'core', 'themes', 'film', 'namely', 'very', 'will', 'survive', 'solemn', 'confession', 'daughter', 'dark', 'picture', 'almost', 'upfront', 'chips', 'away', 'density', 'reveal', 'woman', 'renewed', 'bleak', 'circumstances', 'find', 'will', 'live', 'again', 'film', 'turn', 'uses', 'film', 'completely', 'flip', 'direness', 'head', 'unveil', 'uplifted', 'spirit', 'delivers', 'audience', 'one', 'most', 'engrossing', 'tales', 'internal', 'external', 'survival', '8217', 'ever', 'seen', 'put', 'film.Many', 'critics', 'have', 'already', 'heralded', 'masterpiece', 'year', 'so', 'rich', 'already', '8217', 'only', 'seen', 'handful', 'films', 'won', '8217', 't', 'hesitate', 'thrust', 'label', 'film', 'truly', 'marvelous', 'piece', 'art', 'easily', 'best', 'film', '8217', 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'year', 'great', 'thing', '8216', 'Gravity', '8217', '8217', 't', 'just', 'masterpiece', 'singular', 'aspect', 'angle', 'film', 'nearly', 'perfect']",N/A

Sandra Bullock's heartfelt performance was Oscar worthy, and George Clooney was also excellent. What I particularly liked about the film was the economy with which the story was told. There were no wasted scenes or lines. In that way, it reminded me of another Science Fiction masterpiece, the original Alien. I read that some idiot studio executive had pressured Alfonso Cuaron to add ""flashbacks, a love interest for Sandra Bullock, and an action packed helicopter rescue at the end.""

1684834,AJRZ98VIOES0U,B00H83EUL2,Argyle Ronin,"[0, 0]","Gravity is an incredible film, both in story and form of art. For once, we as an audience are treated to a female heroine that is the exact opposite of Alien's Ripley. This is more than a welcome change in the wake of too many movies featuring butch femme fatales.Sandra Bullock stars as Dr. Ryan Stone, first time astronaut and mission specialist. She is fragile, bubbly, and is the least likely character in Gravity to conquer the harsh, unpredictable environment of outer space. Dr. Stone is accompanied by a fully staffed crew aboard the Space Shuttle Explorer, including George Clooney as veteran astronaut Lt. Matt Kowalski. The mission is simple: service the Hubble Space Telescope and return to Earth.A random Russian missile strike destroys a defunct satellite and sends a giant wave of debris hurdling through space at break-neck speed. As a result of dumb luck, the debris destroys the Explorer and kills all crew aboard the ship, except for Dr. Stone and Lt. Kowalski. Kowalski estimates that they have about 90 minutes before the debris completes a full orbit and strikes them again. All communication with Mission Control in Houston has been lost.The central story is a singular. It's here that director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's (Children of Men) talent shines the most. Both of Gravity's central characters rely on each other to hop scotch between various man-made space structures, and get back to Earth in one piece. Due to the lack of communication with Mission Control and dwindling Oxygen supply, every successful move in Stone and Kowalski's game of chess is dependent on pin-point accuracy, with no room for error. When the pair get entangled in an escape capsule's already deployed parachute, Kowalski cuts himself loose to prevent Stone from drifting away with him into deep space. Now it's up to the rookie astronaut to figure how to board a distant Chinese Space Station and use an escape shuttle to return home.The cinematography and Special FX are some of the most realistic I've ever seen in this context. The simplicity of Stone's losing battle with the lifeless atmosphere of space is both beautiful and terrifying. Like ""Children of Men,"" before it, Cuar&oacute;n's distinct lack of monsters, aliens, or slasher movie villains lend Gravity a unique appeal in contrast to the majority of contemporary science fiction. Due to these qualities, Gravity nabbed 7 well-deserved Oscars at the 2013 awards ceremony, including Best Director, Best Cinematography, and Best Visual Effects.

E Jackson,"[0, 1]","While Gravity does have one minor problem in that it's really hard to base an entire movie around the concept of drifting in space, the film does do everything in its power to at least deliver as much as it possibly can with such a limited idea.  While I don't really care for either George Clooney or Sandra Bullock, the good news is that Clooney's smugness is somewhat reserved and Sandra's usual talkative whining is at least justified in this case since her life is constantly in the balance.  After all she's lost in space by herself.  She has to depend on herself and her limited set of skills to figure out how to launch her space shuttle homeward.  Not an easy task.Surprisingly Gravity does have its share of emotional moments, usually in the way Sandra reflects on her past and specifically a family tragedy that she constantly struggled with (and still struggles with).  The special effects are honestly amazing.  Whether or not teardrops and fire drops actually move as realistically in outer space as portrayed in this film is anyone's guess.  I'm leaning towards they are fairly realistic.  The film may be short at just over 80 minutes, but it's compelling enough that it's not a major issue.I'm normally not even a Sandra Bullock fan.  The last movie she starred in that I enjoyed was the Blind Side and of course, Speed will always be a classic in my book.  But she nails another nail-biting unforgettable performance here.  When things go array and she's desperately trying to cling onto any floating objects she can fearing she might drift away into endless space, you really hope she can grab onto *something* just for the slim chance she'll be able to continue surviving, which is exactly what a good suspense is supposed to do.Gravity proves one thing that used to be a personal problem I had in my late teens- knowing that outside of earth there's millions of miles of nothingness.  This can be the most frightening thing ever.  A lot of people think it's beautiful- floating around forever and experiencing nothing but silence, but I personally think it's terrifying enough to totally make me wish I was dead if I ever found myself in such a situation.  I'm not even exaggerating either.  This is why I was strongly against viewing Jodie Foster's Contact back when that movie was new.  In Gravity the camera angles do all kinds of twists and turns as Sandra and Clooney spin around which is enough to not only make me fear outer space even more than I already do, but can make a viewer dizzy.  It's absolutely brilliant the way the sunlight shines during certain dizzy segments, and its location based on planet Earth at the time these events occur.  It seems so realistic... but is it?  And by the way, Sandra and Clooney remain fairly close to Earth the entire time.On a side note, it's very strange how Clooney and Sandra are spinning and floating around in outer space and having normal conversations.  I'm pretty sure I'd be quite terrified!  Even when the two separate and desperation kicks in, there's still a temporary feeling of normalcy which is really bizarre.Overall I really enjoyed Gravity quite a bit.  Expect a slow, tacky and unappealing introduction since the movie basically just THROWS viewers into the outer space elements right away with very little in the way of a logical or appealing build-up, but I have to conclude that Gravity does its job in making me feel satisfied with the film.  The cinematography at the very least should be amazing enough to entice people to watch this.  Not for the faint of heart however- if you've ever had or currently have fears of what it's like to be somewhere other than earth much like the terrible thoughts that dominated my teenage years, this movie may sort of mess with your mind and make your imagination go wild in a frightening way, so be on the lookout for that.",4,no gravity in space,1405555200,"07 17, 2014",2014,3855,"['Gravity', 'have', 'one', 'minor', 'problem', 'really', 'hard', 'base', 'entire', 'movie', 'concept', 'drifting', 'space', 'film', 'do', 'everything', 'power', 'least', 'deliver', 'as', 'much', 'possibly', 'can', 'limited', 'idea', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'good', 'news', 'Clooney', 'smugness', 'somewhat', 'reserved', 'Sandra', 'usual', 'talkative', 'whining', 'least', 'justified', 'case', 'life', 'constantly', 'balance', 'lost', 'space', 'herself', 'depend', 'limited', 'set', 'skills', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'launch', 'space', 'shuttle', 'homeward', 'Not', 'easy', 'task.Surprisingly', 'Gravity', 'have', 'share', 'emotional', 'moments', 'usually', 'way', 'Sandra', 'past', 'specifically', 'family', 'tragedy', 'constantly', 'struggled', 'still', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'honestly', 'amazing', 'not', 'teardrops', 'fire', 'drops', 'actually', 'move', 'realistically', 'outer', 'space', 'portrayed', 'film', 'anyone', 'guess', ""'m"", 'leaning', 'are', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'short', 'just', '80', 'minutes', 'compelling', 'enough', 'not', 'major', 'issue.I', ""'m"", 'normally', 'not', 'even', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'fan', 'last', 'movie', 'starred', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'Blind', 'Side', 'course', 'Speed', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'classic', 'book', 'nail-biting', 'unforgettable', 'performance', 'here', 'When', 'things', 'go', 'array', 'desperately', 'trying', 'cling', 'floating', 'objects', 'can', 'fearing', 'might', 'drift', 'away', 'endless', 'space', 'really', 'hope', 'can', 'grab', '*something*', 'just', 'slim', 'chance', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'continue', 'surviving', 'exactly', 'what', 'good', 'suspense', 'supposed', 'do.Gravity', 'one', 'thing', 'used', 'be', 'personal', 'problem', 'had', 'late', 'teens-', 'knowing', 'outside', 'earth', 'millions', 'miles', 'nothingness', 'can', 'be', 'most', 'frightening', 'thing', 'ever', 'lot', 'people', 'think', 'beautiful-', 'floating', 'forever', 'experiencing', 'nothing', 'silence', 'personally', 'think', 'terrifying', 'enough', 'totally', 'make', 'wish', 'was', 'dead', 'ever', 'found', 'situation', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'exaggerating', 'either', 'why', 'was', 'strongly', 'viewing', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Contact', 'back', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'new', 'Gravity', 'camera', 'do', 'kinds', 'twists', 'as', 'Sandra', 'Clooney', 'spin', 'enough', 'not', 'only', 'make', 'fear', 'outer', 'space', 'even', 'more', 'already', 'do', 'can', 'make', 'viewer', 'dizzy', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'way', 'sunlight', 'shines', 'certain', 'dizzy', 'segments', 'location', 'based', 'planet', 'Earth', 'time', 'events', 'occur', 'so', 'realistic', 'way', 'Sandra', 'Clooney', 'remain', 'fairly', 'close', 'Earth', 'entire', 'time.On', 'side', 'note', 'very', 'strange', 'how', 'Clooney', 'Sandra', 'are', 'spinning', 'floating', 'around', 'outer', 'space', 'having', 'normal', 'conversations', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', ""'d"", 'be', 'quite', 'terrified', 'Even', 'when', 'two', 'separate', 'desperation', 'kicks', 'still', 'temporary', 'feeling', 'normalcy', 'really', 'bizarre.Overall', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Gravity', 'quite', 'bit', 'Expect', 'slow', 'tacky', 'unappealing', 'introduction', 'movie', 'basically', 'just', 'THROWS', 'viewers', 'outer', 'space', 'elements', 'right', 'away', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'logical', 'appealing', 'build-up', 'have', 'conclude', 'Gravity', 'job', 'making', 'feel', 'satisfied', 'film', 'cinematography', 'very', 'least', 'should', 'be', 'amazing', 'enough', 'entice', 'people', 'watch', 'Not', 'faint', 'heart', 'however-', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'currently', 'have', 'fears', 'what', 'be', 'somewhere', 'other', 'earth', 'much', 'terrible', 'thoughts', 'dominated', 'teenage', 'years', 'movie', 'may', 'sort', 'mess', 'mind', 'make', 'imagination', 'go', 'wild', 'frightening', 'way', 'so', 'be', 'lookout']",N/A

So worrying about the type of movie Blu-ray or 3-D is not necessary. So this would not normally be entered into a review. However in the case of ""Gravity"" (2013) the visuals of Lake Powell, Arizona, space and Sandra are important enough to warrant Blu-ray and even 3D treatment.

They all combine in one pedal-to-the-metal slam-bam technically perfect movie that gives you equal shots of hope and hopelessness from the first frame to the very last.It is as electrifying a film as I have ever seen, with scarcely a down moment in it, hardly a misused frame. I won't spend time telling you anything about the plot; if the trailers haven't told you enough about why this film is a must see, then I can give you two words that should do it...Sandra Bullock.She is not only in practically every frame of the movie, but she exposes herself emotionally here in more ways than I could count: she is equal parts victim and heroine, emotional and calculating, frightened and bold, wounded and powerful.  She is a tortured soul who reveals herself in dribs and drabs, revealing her emotional torment when it will have the most effect.  The movie is as much about what HAS happened to her as what IS happening to her. She is able to make herself as interesting and captivating as the events that occur during the film, and this is important: rather than simply being a movie about a series of cascading terrors, it is equally about the human spirit, the ""stuff"" that lies inside us that drives us to go on when going on seems impossible.GRAVITY is amazing. See it in IMAX 3D if you can; it is worth the money. The technology depicted in the movie is stunning--but I imagine I will be as amazed when I finally get the DVD and find out HOW these truly amazing scenes were shot. Alfonso Cuaron does remarkable job as director, co-writer and co-editor of this absolutely wonderful accomplishment. His technically perfect movie never loses track of the actor within it--I won't be surprised if this achieves Best Picture, Best Directing and Best Acting nominations this year, notwithstanding a half-dozen other technically-related ones.There have been some critics who have found fault with the movie's accuracy when it comes to the positioning of the space stations, the likelihood of a debris field causing a ""Kesslar Syndrome"" this devastating, and some other technical flaws, but I will leave these people to their respective perturbations. To me it doesn't matter if GRAVITY is science fiction or simply fiction about science. What it definitely IS is a tour de force balls-to-the-wall spectacle that will leave you gasping.

1684914,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B00H83EUL2,California Dreaming,"[3, 7]","While watching ""Gravity,"" I was constantly reminded of Newton's First Law of Motion.No, not the part about ""An object in motion tends to stay in motion,"" but rather the part, ""An object at rest tends to stay at rest.""  (In reality, both statements are easily combined into one and it was by the Greatest Mathematician of All Time.)  This was because I didn't want to get up off the couch while watching as it was so good; I wanted to stay at rest while Sandra Bullock did all the heavy lifting.But if you're smart enough to rent this film, you'll realize that the first part applies as well.  While watching, I actually braced myself many times while Ms. Bullock or George Clooney were flying through space, headed towards an imminent collision with, say, their Space Shuttle.  (I thought that the Space Shuttle was mothballed quite a while ago?  Well, no matter.)  Or while Ms. Bullock was headed straight for a Russian Space Station and was obviously going to take a header.  (The Space Station's still there, I think.)And you'll also think about the Third Law, when Ms. Bullock tries to put out a fire with a fire extinguisher and gets thrown violently backwards into a wall.  (There is another fire extinguisher scene, that I didn't exactly buy.  Perhaps possible, but highly improbable.). But you'll think about force equals mass times acceleration, momentum equals mass times velocity, etc. etc.  At least if you took enough Physics in college, I suppose.But I really liked the fact that they showed Mr. Clooney here easily being able to do math problems in his head.  This would be an absolute necessity in space; taking out a calculator would be impossible, and forget about pen and paper.  I suppose you might be able to use Siri, but from my experience, she's not very good at math.  Or even finding directions or a good restaurant, really.  (I tested Siri on some Calculus problems that I did in my head.  I was superior, although she did get a derivative right in a simple case, but she failed on an integral.)While I have a degree in Computer Science and a minor in math, I'm just betting that this film is a physicist's dream.  Most of the physics here really seem to be spot on, unlike most sci-fi films that I've seen.  At the opening of the film, there is even some text that describes ideas such as ""There is no sound in space.""  (Sound waves can't move through nothing, although Stephen Hawking might argue that dark matter is everywhere so maybe we should ask him.)  So the director, right up front, was saying that he was trying to get these things right.  And I think that he really did.If I had a complaint -- I really shouldn't as I believe that this should win Best Picture at The Academy Awards, even though it most likely won't for some ridiculous political correctness reason -- it would be from a statistical analysis perspective.  If you see all of the bad things that Ms. Bullock has to endure, and you assume that those things are independent, and you multiply all of those together, you would quickly realize that the chance of escape pretty much goes to zero for her.  But this is still a film, and you still need the protagonist to endure the most difficult time of her life.  And you need her to not die, at least too quickly, so that you can make it to at least a third act.  So I'll let this one go.What is interesting is the title.  When my wife and I used to live in Noe Valley in San Francisco, I used to always joke, ""Yeah, the physicists that say that 'gravity is a weak force' never tried climbing up and down the hills here,"" as we trudged up to our house on 28th street like Billy Goats.  But this film just might show that we earthlings take gravity for granted.

The basic premise is that two astronauts (three if you count the token foreigner who is only heard and then killed off-screen) who are bouncing around in outer space  for vague, technical reasons are thrown into sudden peril when some equally vague pile of Russian space-crap blows up somewhere and the shrapnel from it races through the area destroying other satellites and, more horribly, the ship that is the only obvious way for Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) to get back to Earth.It's established straight away that Ryan is a pretty serious and rather stressed woman, which made me wonder if she could pass a psych-evaluation for McDonald's, let alone for NASA. On the other hand, Matt is about as laid-back as they come, telling goofy stories about his former love affairs and keeping those around him talking and, as much as possible, cool-headed. When disaster strikes, Matt continues to use this ability for some desperately needed comic relief, while Ryan is encouraged (thanks to his loquaciousness) to tell her story. And that story proves to be the typical, tiresome Hollywood dreck about how she had a child who died when quite young and now--because she didn't quite know what to do with herself or with her life--she works like a dog as a doctor, drives around in circles (when on Earth) and bounces around in outer-space fixing satellites. For a clinically depressed woman, there's little that Dr. Ryan hasn't tried, I'll give her that.Soon enough, Ryan and Matt get into a situation where the latter is basically forced to detach his pseudo-umbilical cord from the former and float off toward Alpha Centauri and death. She vows to save him and manages to get into another ship where I was expecting her character to leap into action, fire up something or other and race in the general direction of her newfound jokester pal. Instead, the moment she's inside, she strips down to her skivvies and hovers in a fetal position before a porthole-shaped door. That's when it dawned on me that ""Gravity"" isn't about anything other than Dr. Ryan Stone making peace with her tragic past and learning how to walk again (while showing off the fact that Bullock has an enviable arse at the less-than-tender age of 50). The rest of the film follows Dr. Ryan as she, bit by bit, does just that.On the one hand, I have to admit that the film is visually stunning and that Bullock turns in a performance that's nuanced enough that I actually found myself reaching for a hanky on occasion. However, to its discredit, this is, all told, one of those flicks that you never need to see twice. The story is too simple for its own good and employs too many dull, Script-O-Matic ""woe is me"" devices.I won't discourage people from watching it and I don't think that loving the movie is a criminal offense. Still, with a few rare exceptions, when you've seen one decently made ""I'm trying to overcome the pain that losing my son/daughter/wife/husband/dog/cat/ant farm/et cetera has caused me while in this absurdly symbolic environment"" flick, you've damn near seen 'em all...unless something truly new and fresh is brought to the table, of course.

It looked amazing in the sole fact that you saw the unimaginable: floating off into vast, dark, nothingness. Needless to say I was thrilled and excited to see the movie, and after not getting a chance to watch it in theaters, plus the fact that it was nominated for best picture and 9 other Academy Awards, I felt like I had to see this amazing film that everyone was raving about. Honestly, I really didn't know what to expect.Let me just say that I am only giving this film 3 stars for the fact that the visual effects and cinematography were so outstanding in a way that I feel disappointed that I didn't go see this in Imax 3-D (and I usually hate 3-D movies). The effects looked absolutely real; much more than I can say about some of the movies that have come out this year and in 2013. And the cinematography was amazing to say the least. It was hauntingly beautiful as Sandra Bullock drifted away, the stunning colors of Earth and stars spinning in her visual. These are the only things I liked about this movie.Don't get me wrong; Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are both amazing actors in their own respects, and I won't say that they didn't play their roles well in this movie because they really did. What made this film so terrible was the script. The whole movie was made up of long and drawn out moments that left me bored, if anything. Not to mention the fact that there was little to no backstory on these characters what so ever. Why should I care if these astronauts drift off into space, never to be seen again? Who are they? We know nothing about them besides a silly story about Mardi Gras and the death of one of their children.So really I do regret not seeing Gravity in theaters, but that is only for the fact that the visual effects were outright stunning in this movie. And for no other reason. I will never watch this boring excuse for a film ever again, and I cannot fathom how this was even in the running for best picture at the Oscars.",3,AMAZING Special Effects and...thats about it,1396310400,"04 1, 2014",2014,2085,"['**Slight', 'Spoilers', 'Ahead**When', 'first', 'saw', 'preview', 'movie', 'left', 'feeling', 'bit', 'disturbed', 'shaken', 'looked', 'amazing', 'sole', 'fact', 'saw', 'unimaginable', 'floating', 'off', 'vast', 'dark', 'nothingness', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'thrilled', 'excited', 'see', 'movie', 'not', 'getting', 'chance', 'watch', 'theaters', 'fact', 'was', 'nominated', 'best', 'picture', '9', 'other', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'felt', 'had', 'see', 'amazing', 'film', 'everyone', 'was', 'raving', 'about', 'Honestly', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect.Let', 'just', 'say', 'am', 'only', 'giving', 'film', '3', 'stars', 'fact', 'visual', 'effects', 'cinematography', 'were', 'so', 'outstanding', 'way', 'feel', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'see', 'Imax', '3-D', 'usually', 'hate', '3-D', 'movies', 'effects', 'looked', 'absolutely', 'real', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'year', '2013', 'cinematography', 'was', 'amazing', 'say', 'least', 'was', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'drifted', 'away', 'stunning', 'colors', 'Earth', 'stars', 'spinning', 'visual', 'are', 'only', 'things', 'liked', 'movie.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'George', 'Clooney', 'are', 'amazing', 'actors', 'own', 'respects', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'roles', 'well', 'movie', 'really', 'did', 'What', 'made', 'film', 'so', 'terrible', 'was', 'script', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'moments', 'left', 'bored', 'anything', 'Not', 'mention', 'fact', 'was', 'little', 'backstory', 'characters', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'Why', 'should', 'care', 'astronauts', 'drift', 'off', 'space', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'Who', 'are', 'know', 'nothing', 'silly', 'story', 'Mardi', 'Gras', 'death', 'one', 'children.So', 'really', 'do', 'regret', 'not', 'seeing', 'Gravity', 'theaters', 'only', 'fact', 'visual', 'effects', 'were', 'outright', 'stunning', 'movie', 'other', 'reason', 'will', 'never', 'watch', 'boring', 'excuse', 'film', 'ever', 'again', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'how', 'was', 'even', 'running', 'best', 'picture', 'Oscars']",N/A

They made me care for their characters. I was scared when they were in danger. I was relieved when they were safe. Sandra held my attention through the whole 90 minutes.Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n made the picture flow smoothly.The suspense was gripping from the begginning till the end.The Cinematography was beautiful. It showed eye-catching images of the Earth from space.Of course it had logical holes that were bigger than houses. They did annoy me but I still enjoyed the film.According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this movie as of November 22, 2013:Release Date: October 4, 2013Production Budget: $100 millionDomestic:  $242,199,000+ Foreign:  $293,600,000= Worldwide:  $535,799,000So, it's popular both in North America and overseas. So far, it took in 435 million dollars more than its production cost. That's a gigantic amount.In short, it's certainly worth watching.P.S.I'm very interested in the survival chance of astronauts in a space accident like this. So, I did a research and found some major problems that made this movie impossible to happen in real life.1. ""There is no way to go hopping from one space station to another so easily. You can't just look around and see another spacecraft and then get there by simply pointing in the general direction with some soft landing jets and a fire extinguisher."" This is quoted from the article named ""What Does A Real Astronaut Think Of 'Gravity'?"" by Garrett Reisman, Former NASA Astronaut, posted on Forbes dot com.2. ""How Hubble (350mi up) ISS (230mi up) & a Chinese Space Station are all in sight lines of one another."" This is a tweet by  famous astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson.In other words, if China had a space station orbiting, it was impossible for Sandra to see it because it was out of her view.3. ""Space jetpacks really do exist! They are called MMUs (Manned Maneuvering Units)... Even so, they are not practical for most missions and were retired almost 30 years ago.They are also not a replacement for a ... spaceship.... Space is big! You can't just backpack around it the way you backpack around Europe. It would be difficult for Kowalsky to retrieve Stone, let alone use his jetpack's nitrogen farts to reach another spacecraft...""This is a quote from the article titled ""20 Scientific Errors in Gravity"" posted on sparknotes dot com/mindhut/",4,Gripping Suspense + Beautiful Cinematography + Engaging acting  + Directing makes it flow seamlessly,1385164800,"11 23, 2013",2013,2574,"['movie', 'was', 'about', 'space', 'accident', 'cause', 'acting', 'directing', 'made', 'original', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'others', 'same', 'genre.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'George', 'Clooney', 'acting', 'were', 'engaging', 'made', 'care', 'characters', 'was', 'scared', 'when', 'were', 'danger', 'was', 'relieved', 'when', 'were', 'safe', 'Sandra', 'held', 'attention', 'whole', '90', 'minutes.Director', 'Alfonso', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'made', 'picture', 'flow', 'smoothly.The', 'suspense', 'was', 'gripping', 'begginning', 'till', 'end.The', 'Cinematography', 'was', 'beautiful', 'showed', 'eye-catching', 'images', 'Earth', 'space.Of', 'course', 'had', 'logical', 'holes', 'were', 'bigger', 'houses', 'did', 'annoy', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'film.According', 'boxofficemojo', 'dot', 'com', 'are', 'financial', 'figures', 'movie', 'November', '22', '2013', 'Release', 'Date', 'October', '4', '2013Production', 'Budget', '100', 'millionDomestic', '242,199,000+', 'Foreign', '293,600,000=', 'Worldwide', '535,799,000So', 'popular', 'North', 'America', 'overseas', 'So', 'far', 'took', '435', 'million', 'dollars', 'more', 'production', 'cost', 'gigantic', 'amount.In', 'short', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching.P.S.I', ""'m"", 'very', 'interested', 'survival', 'chance', 'astronauts', 'space', 'accident', 'So', 'did', 'research', 'found', 'major', 'problems', 'made', 'movie', 'impossible', 'happen', 'real', 'life.1', 'way', 'go', 'hopping', 'one', 'space', 'station', 'so', 'easily', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'look', 'around', 'see', 'spacecraft', 'then', 'get', 'there', 'simply', 'pointing', 'general', 'direction', 'soft', 'landing', 'jets', 'fire', 'extinguisher', 'quoted', 'article', 'named', 'What', 'Real', 'Astronaut', 'Think', ""'Gravity"", 'Garrett', 'Reisman', 'Former', 'NASA', 'Astronaut', 'posted', 'Forbes', 'dot', 'com.2', 'How', 'Hubble', '350mi', 'up', 'ISS', '230mi', 'up', 'Chinese', 'Space', 'Station', 'are', 'sight', 'lines', 'one', 'tweet', 'famous', 'astrophysicist', 'Neil', 'deGrasse', 'Tyson.In', 'other', 'words', 'China', 'had', 'space', 'station', 'orbiting', 'was', 'impossible', 'Sandra', 'see', 'was', 'view.3', 'Space', 'jetpacks', 'really', 'do', 'exist', 'are', 'called', 'MMUs', 'Manned', 'Maneuvering', 'Units', 'Even', 'so', 'are', 'not', 'practical', 'most', 'missions', 'were', 'retired', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'ago.They', 'are', 'also', 'not', 'replacement', 'spaceship', 'Space', 'big', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'backpack', 'way', 'backpack', 'Europe', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'Kowalsky', 'retrieve', 'Stone', 'let', 'alone', 'use', 'jetpack', 'nitrogen', 'farts', 'reach', 'spacecraft', 'quote', 'article', 'titled', '20', 'Scientific', 'Errors', 'Gravity', 'posted', 'sparknotes', 'dot', 'com/mindhut/']",N/A

Very few things.I was a bit surprised by the overall plot, however. Right out of the gate there is plenty of action and drama. Which I like! But at the same time, it really caught myself and others watching off guard. Maybe we were expecting a little more of an Apollo 13 break in. This is one of those movies that is pretty fast paced in terms of changing of events, and you get a little bit of background information on the characters as you go. This is what I didn't like. I wanted to know more about what they were doing and why they were there right from the beginning and we never really got a straight answer. It was so packed with space adventures that they never told us the simple answer: what they were installing on the shuttle to begin with and what it did.

1684948,A2NJRBJFBTF54A,B00H83EUL2,Charles Camp,"[17, 32]","Film critics need to stop name-dropping 2001: A Space Odyssey. Seriously, enough. There's no quicker way of piquing my interest, and no better way of ensuring my disappointment. Don't get me wrong here. Gravity is a decent movie. It can be quite arresting in its best moments, remains visually stunning throughout, and is reasonably entertaining for most of its duration. You could certainly do a hell of a lot worse for the price of admission these days. But despite its considerable strengths, none of them amount to a truly great film worthy of the absolute universal acclaim it has garnered.I'm not going to devote a whole lot of effort into explaining the strengths of the movie because they've basically been enumerated by nearly every single critical review on the internet. Yes, this is an undoubtedly gorgeous film. The visual fidelity is really something to behold, especially during scenes depicting space station destruction. The particle effects are definitely the most eye-popping I've ever seen. What's even more impressive than the visual effects though is the truly free-form, highly original camerawork and cinematography. The vast majority of the movie is shot with lengthy, tightly choreographed yet completely unhinged floating camera pans that are dizzyingly complex. The camerawork is really the most resounding success of the film as it completely creates that feeling of weightlessness and spatial disorientation that the characters are feeling and transmits all of that directly to the viewer.So yes, Gravity is certainly a spectacle and a visual feast, but honestly that's where the good things I have to say about it end. Thematically, this movie is essentially barren. All that's really at its heart is a half-baked attempt at reversing a traumatic, potentially damaging experience into a moment of rebirth, reinvigoration, and self-actualization. It's not even an original idea to begin with, but this isn't a particularly compelling rendition and the characters are at fault. This has got to be some of the most bland, undercooked characterization I've ever seen in a film with such positive reviews. After spending a full hour and a half with Bullock's character, all I feel I've really learned about her is that she's pretty damn efficient at taking on and off a space suit. Oh, and she has a pretty impressive lung capacity. I'm obviously exaggerating a bit- there's a very vague backstory involving the death of her daughter which gives us some perspective into her decidedly withdrawn and, frankly, boring demeanor. But it just isn't substantial enough to make her intriguing as a character and makes it very difficult to really buy into her transformation at the end of the movie.What's frustrating to me too is the fact that a lot of these issues could've been resolved with a little more exposition. This isn't a long movie at all. It easily could've been 30 minutes longer without even the remote danger of being bloated. Just 30 extra minutes of scenes devoted to characterization could've done wonders for the film and really gave it some weight and emotional resonance. Bullock's breakdown scene in the fuel-less escape pod is the perfect glimpse into the movie this could've been. It's by far the best scene in the movie and the only time where I was truly absorbed in the story rather than just admiring the pretty visuals. In this moment, Bullock's character shows a moment of complete vulnerability as she realizes the bleakness of her situation. She is completely alone, both in the overtly obvious physical sense but also in an emotional sense as well. This is such brilliant moment because it takes the character's emotional isolation since the death of her daughter and weaves it directly into her current physical isolation, creating a nice metaphor that instantly breathes life into the movie and gives it a sense of purpose. The character has essentially been drifting in this dead escape pod ever since her daughter died, and it isn't until this moment that she has finally come to terms with it.This moment is just as fleeting as it is powerful though, and it comes off as too little too late at this point. I do have some other more minor quibbles with different scenes in the movie that I thought were handled poorly as well. Early on in the film there's a nice moment where Clooney's character says something to the effect of ""nothing beats the view"" and the camera pans over Earth with some really nice ambient music that kicks in. But as it re-circles back to Clooney the music fades to complete silence a little abruptly and the transition into more dialogue feels awkward. There's also a particularly hokey moment where Bullock's character verbally compares her flight in the escape pod to the times where she would ""just drive"" after her daughter's accident. It comes off as a very forced attempt to integrate the relatively useless backstory into the present moment and just ends up being cringe-worthy. There's definitely more moments like this too- Bullock's howling along with the dog on the radio transmission or the corny, triumphant line of dialogue towards the end where she essentially announces something to the effect of ""well, whether I live or die this has been a hell of a ride!"" I realize these are relatively petty criticisms but the film stumbles like this enough for it to take me out of the moment and detrimentally affect the viewing experience.At the end of the day though, this isn't an awful movie. It isn't even a bad movie. It offers up some very compelling set pieces, unbelievable visuals, and some truly phenomenal camerawork that alone makes it worth the 10 bucks. But it's also a film that is ultimately very hollow, essentially devoid of compelling characters, and severely lacking in substance. Yes, it provides the superficial thrills and the eye candy. But for a film with so many accolades, it really leaves a lot to be desired.",2,Beautifully Hollow.,1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,5927,"['Film', 'critics', 'need', 'stop', 'name-dropping', '2001',

1684951,A11L8QJD2JXBUP,B00H83EUL2,Charles M. Britzman,"[0, 0]","My daughter and I saw this movie in IMAX.  Everything you've heard is true - like James Cameron said, it's the greatest space movie ever made (as far as realism). No monsters or energy weapons, no evil interstellar empires, no spacecraft making roaring noises as they fly by, or maneuvering like dogfighting F16's - just a really bad day for current-tech astronauts. When Sandra Bullock uses a cordless driver to loosen bolts while spacewalking, what we hear is what she would hear in her spacesuit ; the muffled whine of the motor and muffled thumps of engaging the bolt heads, all conducted through her arm and suit. And a lot of breathing. When pieces of space debris impact the Shuttle and the ISS, there is no noise, but the story urgency is maintained by the radio chatter, the musical score and the spectacular and detailed explosions of pieces and assemblies flying and tumbling in all directions, in straight lines. All this set against a cloud-covered Earth. When I could spare a second from the action, I remember noticing both Italy and the Sinai Peninsula. I'm sure others saw more.George Clooney plays the experienced spaceman, who is a master of keeping the work schedule moving with a light and friendly mood, mostly through non-stop stories from his colorful life. One minute they're eye-rolling groaners, the next they're a welcome, calm and distracting anchor for sanity in the void. Sandra Bullock is the rookie astronaut with a medical degree who is nevertheless being put to work checking out Hubble's circuit boards. She's competent and capable, but it takes all she's got to work on the Hubble while perched at the end of the Canadarm.Sandra and George are the only on-camera actors in this 1 1/2hr movie. Ed Harris plays the voice of the CAPCOM in Houston.. (If anything ever happens to Tom Hanks, I think Ed Harris would have to take up a lot of the slack).The space debris becomes a problem when the Russians fire a missile to destroy one of their own satellites (""Probably a spy sat"", says George). The destruction becomes a cascading domino effect that quickly engulfs dozens of other satellites, and the whole mess turns into a cloud of hypervelocity space junk orbiting at the same height as the Shuttle repair mission on the Hubble. This debris cloud takes a couple minutes to whiz by, or impact on something, and then you have 90 minutes before it orbits the Earth and catches up with you again. Nice !The movie gives you a real sense of what's waiting just beyond NASA's experience, research, protocols and contingency plans. When one area of tech causes problems for another area (human-caused space debris becoming a deadly threat to humans in orbit) we're back to gut-level reactions, self-control and creative improvisation, particularly since we lose Ed Harris's, and therefore Ground Control's, presence early in the catastrophe.As a scifi freak, I noticed some fishy things about this otherwise very physics-realistic movie, such as how the Hubble, the ISS and the Chinese space station all seemed to be in the same neighborhood, flying in a loose formation up there. Not so. In reality the orbits are at different heights, therefore traveling at different speeds, and also at different inclinations relative to each other. The overall sequence of events in the movie is  impossible, as far as movement between assets by free-floating astronauts.You can't be replacing batteries in the Hubble, and an hour later cruise over to the ISS with nothing but a spacesuit jet-pack.  Also, a couple little things, like Sandra Bullock's space helmet floating around in the cabin of a Soyuz that is currently decelerating, rather than jammed against the dashboard. For it to float, both it and the Soyuz have to be flying at the same speed.I also have to believe that seeing this movie in 3D is the way to go. Several scenes made you feel like you're crawling on the outside of the ISS right with the astronauts.There's the rounded hump of a cylindrical section, covered with sun shield material, between you and them; you're waiting your turn to go in the airlock, and all you hear is voices and breathing on the radio, while huge chunks of debris fly by, momentarily blocking the sun and making you wince and blink. And when Sandra goes tumbling out of control, far away from anyone or anything else, for a moment you feel what it would be like to be that helpless, with a dwindling oxygen supply, only static on the radio, and with Earth and Heaven chasing each other in a circle across your field of vision.But I am just another person willing to suspend disbelief for the sake of the experience, and this movie gets so much right, or at least what looks right (I haven't made it up to Low Earth Orbit, myself, yet) that I still came out of it having learned something. Just like being in any other wilderness, drifting free in Earth orbit can either be stunningly beautiful or a black terror. It's up to you to make that choice.",4,ONE GIANT LEAP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION,1395187200,"03 19, 2014",2014,4963,"['daughter', 'saw', 'movie', 'IMAX', 'Everything', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'true', 'James',

1684962,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B00H83EUL2,Chris Kennison,"[7, 10]","One of the most talked about trailers of the year has been the two-minute trailer for ""Gravity"" that features Sandra Bullock and George Clooney floating in space. In the two-minutes, we see a brief intense and desperate moment in the span of a long movie where Bullock's character, Ryan Stone, tries to grab hold of anything and everything as her situation spins out of control. Many thought, ""Is that it? Is that what the movies about?"" or, ""Two people in space. That movie looks silly."" Well, ""Gravity"" is far from silly.On the other hand, what you see in that trailer is exactly what you will have in store when you sit down to watch it. It is exactly what the movie is about and there are only two people in the entire movie. You will also see an amazingly well crafted, intelligent, exquisite and visceral space journey that possibly puts all other movies of the same vain to shame.Regardless of what you think of the trailer, you couldn't take your eyes off of it for two-minutes and that is exactly the way the full 90-minute movie is. ""Gravity"" takes you into space and treats you as if you were a tag-along for Ryan Stone's journey. The direction of Alfonso Cuaron is spot on, if not for a few minor moments of over-dramatization.Cuaron may be most well known for his direction of ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", but he also directed ""Children of Men"" and one of my personal favorites, ""A Little Princess"". This is a phenomenal achievement for Cuaron and for the history and future of film-making. If you've ever desired to go to space, this may be as close as you will ever get. ""Gravity"" rings authentic and it is exactly what movies are all about, taking you, the viewer along for a journey that you can't get in your ordinary life.",5,WHAT FILM MAKING IS ALL ABOUT,1381104000,"10 7, 2013",2013,1756,"['One', 'most', 'talked', 'trailers', 'year', 'been', 'two-minute', 'trailer', 'Gravity', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'George', 'Clooney', 'floating', 'space', 'two-minutes', 'see', 'brief', 'intense', 'desperate', 'moment', 'span', 'long', 'movie', 'where', 'Bullock', 'character', 'Ryan', 'Stone', 'grab', 'hold', 'anything', 'everything', 'situation', 'control', 'Many', 'thought', 'what', 'movies', 'Two', 'people', 'space', 'movie', 'silly', 'Well', 'Gravity', 'far', 'silly.On', 'other', 'hand', 'what', 'see', 'trailer', 'exactly', 'what', 'will', 'have', 'store', 'when', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'exactly', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'people', 'entire', 'movie', 'will', 'also', 'see', 'amazingly', 'well', 'crafted', 'intelligent', 'exquisite', 'visceral', 'space', 'journey', 'possibly', 'other', 'movies', 'same', 'vain', 'shame.Regardless', 'what', 'think', 'trailer', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'two-minutes', 'exactly', 'way', 'full', '90-minute', 'movie', 'Gravity', 'space', 'treats', 'were', 'tag-along', 'Ryan', 'Stone', 'journey', 'direction', 'Alfonso', 'Cuaron', 'spot', 'not', 'few', 'minor', 'moments', 'over-dramatization.Cuaron', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'direction', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Prisoner', 'Azkaban', 'also', 'directed', 'Children', 'Men', 'one', 'personal', 'favorites', 'Little', 'Princess', 'phenomenal', 'achievement', 'Cuaron', 'history', 'future', 'film-making', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'desired', 'go', 'space', 'may', 'be', 'as', 'close', 'will', 'ever', 'get', 'Gravity', 'rings', 'authentic', 'exactly', 'what', 'movies', 'are', 'taking', 'viewer', 'journey', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'ordinary', 'life']",N/A

Sandra Bullock and George Clooney together, and often Bullock alone, face crisis after crisis after debris smashes into their space shuttle.  Thus begins an exciting thriller set in space.  Bullock's attempt to get back to earth is much more complicated and tense than I would have expected.  There were many moments where the visual look of space engrossed me in the experience.The movie relies heavily on sound vs. silence, on an almost first-person perspective of the crisis, and on a ""real time"" pace.  Real time means the story flows in the same timespan as it's depicted as; there's no skipping over time in the edits/cuts.  I think real time is used in Gravity to the same effectiveness as the great western suspense thriller High Noon.  The script is very economical, combining practical discussion of emergency measures with Bullock talking with Clooney about her personal background.  There's even a little humor, part of which is from Clooney having a WWII kind of joking/understated style of stating the problem (""This isn't going to be a joy ride"" is the kind of thing his character says when there's a big issue).On a thematic level, Clooney's character helps her move forward in life instead of hiding from it, which is really what grounds the movie.  You really want her to survive and live her life with less melancholy once she gets back to earth, and there is great satisfaction when she finally does get home to earth and is so glad to get to shore.  The visual contrast from loneliness and blackness to the colors of earth is a quite satisfying resolution, as is the visible relief on her face at the end.  Sandra Bullock is an actress you can look at for solid minutes, and she remains easy to watch and doesn't seem like she's acting, even when she is sad or scared for a lot of the movie.  She is quite a natural actress.I felt that the only thing missing from the movie was more development of/transformation in her view of God.  She talked about wanting God's help but not knowing how to pray, and said ""thank you"" (presumably to God) when she was finally safe, but there wasn't any further development.It's a very unique movie in its construction, especially how it creates suspense with letting you hear the silence and the breathing and mechanical and electric noises, with music rarely getting much in the way.  It also grounds the whole story in a symbolic contrast between outer space's loneliness and earth's vivacity, which symbolizes Bullock's struggle to move on and embrace life instead of closing herself off from pain.  The mostly practical relationship between Bullock and Clooney very economically addresses, in the midst of various crises, her own personal struggle to move on and embrace life, which is what the movie ultimately is about.  For these reasons, I recommend seeing it.",4,A movie unlike any other I've seen - well-crafted in every way and entertaining,1381881600,"10 16, 2013",2013,2878,"['definitely', 'see', 'how', 'movie', 'such', 'smash', 'hit', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'George', 'Clooney', 'together', 'often', 'Bullock', 'alone', 'face', 'crisis', 'crisis', 'debris', 'smashes', 'space', 'shuttle', 'Thus', 'exciting', 'thriller', 'set', 'space', 'Bullock', 'attempt', 'get', 'back', 'earth', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'tense', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'were', 'many', 'moments', 'where', 'visual', 'look', 'space', 'engrossed', 'experience.The', 'movie', 'relies', 'heavily', 'sound', 'vs.', 'silence', 'almost', 'first-person', 'perspective', 'crisis', 'real', 'time', 'pace', 'Real', 'time', 'story', 'same', 'timespan', 'depicted', 'skipping', 'time', 'edits/cuts', 'think', 'real', 'time', 'used', 'Gravity', 'same', 'effectiveness', 'great', 'western', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'High', 'Noon', 'script', 'very', 'economical', 'combining', 'practical', 'discussion', 'emergency', 'measures', 'Bullock', 'talking', 'Clooney', 'personal', 'background', 'even', 'little', 'humor', 'part', 'Clooney', 'having', 'WWII', 'kind', 'joking/understated', 'style', 'stating', 'problem', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'joy', 'ride', 'kind', 'thing', 'character', 'when', 'big', 'issue', 'thematic', 'level', 'Clooney', 'character', 'move', 'forward', 'life', 'instead', 'hiding', 'really', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'want', 'survive', 'live', 'life', 'less', 'melancholy', 'back', 'earth', 'great', 'satisfaction', 'when', 'finally', 'get', 'home', 'earth', 'so', 'glad', 'get', 'shore', 'visual', 'contrast', 'loneliness', 'blackness', 'colors', 'earth', 'quite', 'satisfying', 'resolution', 'visible', 'relief', 'face', 'end', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'actress', 'can', 'look', 'solid', 'minutes', 'easy', 'watch', ""n't"", 'seem', 'acting', 'even', 'when', 'sad', 'scared', 'lot', 'movie', 'quite', 'natural', 'actress.I', 'felt', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'development', 'of/transformation', 'view', 'God', 'talked', 'wanting', 'God', 'help', 'not', 'knowing', 'how', 'pray', 'said', 'thank', 'presumably', 'God', 'when', 'was', 'finally', 'safe', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'further', 'development.It', 'very', 'unique', 'movie', 'construction', 'especially', 'how', 'suspense', 'letting', 'hear', 'silence', 'breathing', 'mechanical', 'electric', 'noises', 'music', 'rarely', 'getting', 'much', 'way', 'also', 'whole', 'story', 'symbolic', 'contrast', 'outer', 'space', 'loneliness', 'earth', 'vivacity', 'Bullock', 'struggle', 'move', 'embrace', 'life', 'instead', 'closing', 'off', 'pain', 'mostly', 'practical', 'relationship', 'Bullock', 'Clooney', 'very', 'economically', 'midst', 'various', 'crises', 'own', 'personal', 'struggle', 'move', 'embrace', 'life', 'what', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'reasons', 'recommend', 'seeing']",N/A

What a vulnerable cocoon surrounds us, separating all this life from absolute nothingness. What's absolutely awesome is that 99.99999999999.....% of the universe is absolute nothingness. And here we are on this precious little bubble.Here's a little fact you might want to consider the next time you think about human-made global warming. In one billion years, the Sun will have gotten so much hotter (and bigger), that the temperature on Earth will be, on average, 100 degrees (F) hotter than it is now. That means, an average Winter day in San Francisco will be 150 degrees. The Arctic will be a cool 70.I'm sure, if there is any self-aware life (notice I didn't say, intelligent life) left on Earth, someone will find a way to blame humans for the increased temperature. Wait another billion years and there definitely won't be self-aware life, or any life, for that matter, left on Earth. All water will be gone and the entire surface of the planet will be molten. Talk about a major extinction event! In three billion years, the Sun will have gotten so big that it will take up the entire horizon. How's that for perspective?WOW, did I go off on a tangent...Anyway, back to my review of ""Gravity"". Not only does it make you think about the fragility of our existence but it's also a heart stopping thrill ride! Some might think that 3D wouldn't add a whole lot to a film set mostly in space without a lot of foreground or background objects. I found it to be a definite plus. It provided a sense of isolation, panic and devastation that I've never felt with any film that takes place in space.The special effects are astonishing. The weightless scenes are so believable, I would believe it if I was told the film was actually shot in space. They make the ""Apollo 13"" weightless scenes look absolutely amateurish by comparison. And I remember at the time, those effects were jaw-dropping. I couldn't help but think how far they've come, in such a short time.The only reason I took away 1 star is because there were a couple of obvious ""Hollywood-ish"" incidents written in the script which made me think to myself, ""oh come on, how stupid could you be?""

1685001,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B00H83EUL2,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[0, 0]","Some films (Castaway, 127 Hours) have a simple premise, a basic tale of survival, devoid of large casts and complicated plotlines.  Co-written with his son Jon&aacute;s Cuar&oacute;n, director and co-writer Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Y Tu Mam&aacute; Tambi&eacute;n) has combined state of the art technology and remarkable acting by Sandra Bullock in a spectacular, tension-filled adventure, Gravity.American astronauts Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), work on repairs to the Hubble space telescope as news of a nearby Russian satellite explosion is reported.  The quiet serenity is suddenly displaced by hurtling debris that decimates the repair mission and causes great damage to the telescope and more.  Caught up in a life threatening disaster and stranded in space without any hope of rescue, the two must improvise and utilize survival skills to survive under impossible circumstances.  As hope fades and oxygen running low, the astronauts must make difficult choices to make it home alive.Caur&oacute;n successfully conveys the emptiness and vastness of space and how isolated it can be.  What is remarkable is that this film could not have been made so convincingly until now because of recent technological developments.  Even director James Cameron (Avatar), who was consulted early on, championed the film&#8217;s ambitions for space realism that was years in the making.  A ground breaking achievement in visual effects, not since Stanley Kubrick&#8217;s 2001: A Space Odyssey or Apollo 13 has a film so realistically depicted space travel.  Even the realistic use of sound or lack of it enhances the authenticity.  Great care and research obviously went into the production.The film boldly starts with a continuous panning shot for thirteen minutes with nary a cut.  When was the last time a major Hollywood film did that?  There are some remarkable shots in space like the one instance where Bullock is in a womb-like position which acts as a metaphor of life.  Gravity deserves to be seen in 3D (perhaps the best 3D film since Avatar) which opens up the magnitude of the visual effects.  When did any 3D film show a person&#8217;s tears?  This one does.  The realism and emptiness of space will be hard to match so convincingly in future films.Cuar&oacute;n establishes a basic premise and creates a major conflict while continually upping the ante of impending danger.  The suspense is palpable as we feel as if we are there with Bullock and must figure a way to first get out of harm&#8217;s way and then to go home to earth.  The one film this reminds you of is Marooned.This is Bullock&#8217;s (The Blind Side) show all the way as you feel her fears amid every threat; she is in virtually every shot.  We learn to understand her feelings and get a glimpse into her past about her regrets in life.  Paradoxically, space becomes a place to escape her past or prove to be her death.  One major theme for her character is learning to let go whether it be a painful past memory or letting go of something in the here and now.  It&#8217;s about finding a reason to live and finding a deeply personal redemption under the most trying circumstances.Clooney lends strong support as her veteran colleague and voice of reason who offers instructions and calm amid tragedy.  You will never guess who voices mission control, but here&#8217;s a hint- see Apollo 13.Sure, despite convenient coincidences that facilitate some plot points and a couple situations that are a bit hard to believe, Bullock sells it with her conviction and desperation; you buy into the situation regardless even if it may be hallucination or a dream.What should be noteworthy is the fact that Gravity is rated PG in an era when PG13 and R rated major releases dominate the marketplace.  And it runs a lean 90 minutes.  How such a simple tale of survival and hope becomes not only totally engaging but such a compelling, landmark work of cinema is the lasting legacy of Gravity.",5,GRAVITY Soars,1393545600,"02 28, 2014",2014,4028,"['films', 'Castaway', '127', 'Hours', 'have', 'simple', 'premise', 'basic', 'tale', 'survival', 'devoid', 'large', 'casts', 'complicated', 'plotlines', 'Co-written', 'son', 'Jon', 'aacute', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'director', 'co-writer', 'Alfonso', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Prisoner', 'Azkaban', 'Y', 'Tu', 'Mam', 'aacute', 'Tambi', 'eacute', 'combined', 'state', 'art', 'technology', 'remarkable', 'acting', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'spectacular', 'tension-filled', 'adventure', 'Gravity.American', 'Ryan', 'Stone', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Matt', 'Kowalski', 'George', 'Clooney', 'work', 'repairs', 'Hubble', 'space', 'telescope', 'news', 'nearby', 'Russian', 'satellite', 'explosion', 'reported', 'quiet', 'serenity', 'suddenly', 'displaced', 'hurtling', 'debris', 'repair', 'mission', 'great', 'damage', 'telescope', 'more', 'Caught', 'up', 'life', 'threatening', 'disaster', 'stranded', 'space', 'hope', 'rescue', 'two', 'must', 'improvise', 'utilize', 'survival', 'skills', 'survive', 'impossible', 'circumstances', 'hope', 'fades', 'oxygen', 'running', 'low', 'astronauts', 'must', 'make', 'difficult', 'choices', 'make', 'home', 'alive.Caur', 'oacute', 'successfully', 'conveys', 'emptiness', 'vastness', 'space', 'how', 'isolated', 'can', 'be', 'What', 'remarkable', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'so', 'convincingly', 'now', 'recent', 'technological', 'developments', 'Even', 'director', 'James', 'Cameron', 'Avatar', 'who', 'was', 'consulted', 'early', 'championed', 'film', '8217', 's', 'ambitions', 'space', 'realism', 'was', 'years', 'making', 'ground', 'breaking', 'achievement', 'visual', 'effects', 'not', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', '8217', 's', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'Apollo', '13', 'film', 'so', 'realistically', 'depicted', 'space', 'travel', 'Even', 'realistic', 'use', 'sound', 'lack', 'authenticity', 'Great', 'care', 'research', 'obviously', 'went', 'production.The', 'film', 'boldly', 'continuous', 'panning', 'shot', 'thirteen', 'minutes', 'cut', 'When', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'did', 'are', 'remarkable', 'shots', 'space', 'one', 'instance', 'where', 'Bullock', 'womb-like', 'position', 'metaphor', 'life', 'Gravity', 'be', 'seen', '3D', 'perhaps', 'best', '3D', 'film', 'Avatar', 'up', 'magnitude', 'visual', 'effects', 'When', 'did', '3D', 'film', 'show', 'person', '8217', 'tears', 'one', 'realism', 'emptiness', 'space', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'match', 'so', 'convincingly', 'future', 'films.Cuar', 'oacute', 'basic', 'premise', 'major', 'conflict', 'continually', 'upping', 'ante', 'impending', 'danger', 'suspense', 'palpable', 'feel', 'are', 'there', 'Bullock', 'must', 'figure', 'way', 'first', 'get', 'harm', '8217', 's', 'way', 'then', 'go', 'home', 'earth', 'one', 'film', 'Marooned.This', 'Bullock', '8217', 'Blind', 'Side', 'show', 'way', 'feel', 'fears', 'threat', 'virtually', 'shot', 'learn', 'understand', 'feelings', 'get', 'glimpse', 'past', 'regrets', 'life', 'Paradoxically', 'space', 'place', 'escape', 'past', 'prove', 'be', 'death', 'One', 'major', 'theme', 'character', 'learning', 'let', 'go', 'be', 'painful', 'past', 'memory', 'letting', 'go', 'something', 'here', 'now', '8217', 's', 'finding', 'reason', 'live', 'finding', 'deeply', 'personal', 'redemption', 'most', 'trying', 'circumstances.Clooney', 'strong', 'support', 'veteran', 'colleague', 'voice', 'reason', 'who', 'instructions', 'calm', 'tragedy', 'will', 'never', 'guess', 'who', 'mission', 'control', 'here', '8217', 's', 'hint-', 'see', 'Apollo', '13.Sure', 'convenient', 'coincidences', 'facilitate', 'plot', 'points', 'couple', 'situations', 'are', 'bit', 'hard', 'believe', 'Bullock', 'conviction', 'desperation', 'buy', 'situation', 'regardless', 'even', 'may', 'be', 'hallucination', 'should', 'be', 'noteworthy', 'fact', 'Gravity', 'rated', 'PG', 'era', 'when', 'PG13', 'R', 'rated', 'major', 'releases', 'dominate', 'marketplace', 'lean', '90', 'minutes', 'How', 'such', 'simple', 'tale', 'survival', 'hope', 'not', 'only', 'totally', 'engaging', 'compelling', 'landmark', 'work', 'cinema', 'lasting', 'legacy', 'Gravity']",N/A

Between the acting and the visuals, it really feels like you're right there alongside the characters experiencing this. I admit this movie is better in 3D. Hopefully you have a surround system and a large screen 3D capable TV to watch it on disc.Visuals: I couldn't imagine how they made it look so real, so I read up on it after I saw it. The space scenes were a cleverly done combination of CGI and properly lit faces. They had to come up with a whole new lighting system to sync them up. The indoor zero-g scenes required actor supporting automotive robots, plus perfectly choreography and acting to work. Totally amazing and believable. Bullock works long hours and showed expert acting skills to pull this off.Reality: It turns out only a few details were not true to life. The initial disaster is something that's never YET happened in space, but could - The Kessler Effect. (Don't look it up before seeing the film.) By eschewing the typical movie explosions, they made the movie both factual and more believable. The trailers for the movie did feature sounds; they needed them to sell. But once you're in the theater, the actors rely on expressions, voice, movement, and breathing rates to indicate emotion. The music is not intrusive and was a big contributing factor to atmosphere.  It's impossible to describe the sense of terror and panic these things convey. Items outside the shuttle and space stations break up silently but no less frighteningly.  One article on line really summed this up for me, It said that most space films give a ""romantic"" view of space; this move imparts the actuality of the ""awesome and terrifying"" nature of it instead.Acting: As I said above - superb. Sandra Bullock spent 10 hour days alone inside a cramped set to clomplete the film. She could only communicate by headset. her dedication shows. George Clooney is also at his very best, his easy manner even in an emergency a true portrayal of a long time professional trained to keep his head in any situation. (Bullock's character had only trained 6 months for her first space expedition.)Sound: Stunning. Subtle. Composer Steven Price manages to make a perfect score that enhanses the emotion and action without being obtrusive. That's a hard feat to pull off in space, where nothing ahs sound. Portions were done to match the tempo of an actor's heartbeat. No percussion is used. There's an ominous, lonely feel.

1685014,A11QQCQ6P0L3B,B00H83EUL2,Dan Harlow,"[0, 0]","About 10 min into Gravity I realized the genius of casting two huge stars in the lead: instant empathy.Most people know who George Clooney and Sandra Bullock are and many of those people like them both, too. Gravity uses their star power not only to sell tickets to a pretty daring film, but also to do away with the necessity of having to build up any major back story for these characters.The action starts almost right away and doesn't waste time with bogging you down with flashbacks or unnecessary exposition. I'd go as far to say that this is the best star casting I've ever seen in a film - even better than Henry Fonda in 'Once Upon A Time In The West'.Another thing that helps make this movie great is that the dialogue is nothing special - the relationship between Bullock and Clooney is based on banal banter for the most part. Normally that would kill a movie about just 2 people, but here it works because if this film had weighted itself down with 'deep' characters and a psychological intense study of them, the movie would have fallen flat. Even the cliche moments of tapping gauges that all of a sudden show empty, the heavy handed metaphor of human evolution, and all the other 'movie' moments all work to make this movie great because it just takes you on the most exciting, beautiful, stressful, incredible voyage I've ever seen in a film. Cuar&oacute;n is in such control of this epic  and his craft as a filmmaker that he uses every old trick in the storytelling department from the dusty backlot of Hollywood and uses them in service of an adventure ride like nothing ever put on screen. Had he tried to infuse this film with more depth it wouldn't have been as good of a film because it would have taken you out of the moment and distracted you from the mission at hand.This film is like nothing I've ever seen, I mean, it actually is the dictionary definition of 'spectacular' and 'epic'. I was so caught up in this film that my heart was racing pretty much the entire time and when it was over I remembered why it is that I love going to the movies. Seeing this in 3D is probably the only way to see the film; I can't imagine how much will be lost when watching it on a television because a lot of the tension and emotional texture of the film is built around a feeling of being adrift in a three dimensional space so large, vast, cold, and beautiful that a law should be passed requiring all movie theaters to show this film at least once a month.Some of the science in the film is inaccurate (the stations are not anywhere near that close together because space is really, really big), but none of that matters because this is hands down one of the most fun and technically brilliant films I've ever seen.",5,A reason to go to the theater,1405209600,"07 13, 2014",2014,2733,"['10', 'min', 'Gravity', 'realized', 'genius', 'casting', 'two', 'huge', 'stars', 'lead', 'instant', 'empathy.Most', 'people', 'know', 'who', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'are', 'many', 'people', 'too', 'Gravity', 'star', 'power', 'not', 'only', 'sell', 'tickets', 'pretty', 'daring', 'film', 'also', 'do', 'away', 'necessity', 'having', 'build', 'up', 'major', 'back', 'story', 'characters.The', 'action', 'almost', 'right', 'away', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'bogging', 'down', 'flashbacks', 'unnecessary', 'exposition', ""'d"", 'go', 'as', 'far', 'say', 'best', 'star', 'casting', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'even', 'better', 'Henry', 'Fonda', ""'Once"", 'A', 'Time', ""West'.Another"", 'thing', 'make', 'movie', 'great', 'dialogue', 'nothing', 'special', 'relationship', 'Bullock', 'Clooney', 'based', 'banal', 'banter', 'most', 'part', 'Normally', 'would', 'kill', 'movie', 'just', '2', 'people', 'here', 'film', 'had', 'weighted', 'down', ""'deep"", 'characters', 'psychological', 'intense', 'study', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'fallen', 'flat', 'Even', 'cliche', 'moments', 'tapping', 'gauges', 'sudden', 'show', 'empty', 'heavy', 'handed', 'metaphor', 'human', 'evolution', 'other', 'moments', 'work', 'make', 'movie', 'great', 'just', 'most', 'exciting', 'beautiful', 'stressful', 'incredible', 'voyage', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'such', 'control', 'epic', 'craft', 'filmmaker', 'old', 'trick', 'storytelling', 'department', 'dusty', 'backlot', 'Hollywood', 'service', 'adventure', 'ride', 'nothing', 'ever', 'put', 'screen', 'Had', 'tried', 'infuse', 'film', 'more', 'depth', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'good', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'moment', 'distracted', 'mission', 'hand.This', 'film', 'nothing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'mean', 'actually', 'dictionary', 'definition', ""'spectacular"", ""'epic"", 'was', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'film', 'heart', 'was', 'racing', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'remembered', 'why', 'love', 'going', 'movies', 'Seeing', '3D', 'probably', 'only', 'way', 'see', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'how', 'much', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'when', 'watching', 'television', 'lot', 'tension', 'emotional', 'texture', 'film', 'built', 'feeling', 'being', 'adrift', 'three', 'dimensional', 'space', 'so', 'large', 'vast', 'cold', 'beautiful', 'law', 'should', 'be', 'passed', 'requiring', 'movie', 'theaters', 'show', 'film', 'least', 'once', 'month.Some', 'science', 'film', 'inaccurate', 'stations', 'are', 'not', 'anywhere', 'close', 'together', 'space', 'really', 'really', 'big', 'none', 'matters', 'down', 'one', 'most', 'fun', 'technically', 'brilliant', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen']",N/A

The opening sequence is a fabulous experience in itself where the viewer is brought into the experience of the astronauts working outside the space shuttle. The initial view of Earth is not only breathtaking but one has the feeling of weightlessness as George Clooney, using his jet pack, does a space walk.  Gravity's director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n wrote the script with his son, Jon&aacute;s and came up with a simple story of survival that rivals Apollo 13 for sheer excitement with many moments fright. Ironically, Ed Harris is the voice of Mission Control. After the initial 13 minutes, where repairs are being done to the Hubble Space Telescope, there is no letup in the edge-of-your-seat drama.Although this is a movie dominated by special effects, it is the performances of the actors that are truly memorable. George Clooney was an excellent choice to play Matt Kowalski, the mission commander. He brings an authority to the role as if he had flown a dozen space shuttle missions. Sandra Bullock is likewise excellent as first-time astronaut Ryan Stone. She is the focus of the film and turns in a superb performance as she desperately tries to find the lifeboat that will take her back to earth. There are some improbable moments in the film where Ryan manages to push the right button but it is the performance by Ms. Bullock that takes hold of the audience and makes us care.  Even in their cumbersome flight suits, Clooney and Bullock connect with their audience.Gravity is one of those rare films that will have you thinking and talking about the experience long after you have left the theater.

I am not a scientist but even I could spot the glaring mistakes. (Caution: lots of spoilers ahead) The premise behind the film is that the Russians make a hash of blowing up one of their satellites and generate a lot of lethal space junk. In real life this wouldn't pose much of a risk, since all the various space stations and satellites are in totally different orbits. No matter, we'll chalk this down to artistic licence.That would be all right if the plot were at least half plausible. It isn't. Sandra Bullock plays a scientist who, with just six months' training, is allowed to work on a space shuttle. She and George Clooney and an Indian scientist are repairing a broken piece of equipment when disaster! The space debris from the shattered satellite wreaks havoc. But this is special movie debris, so it arcs languidly over the horizon, clearly visible, and strikes the shuttle at perhaps 500 miles an hour. In real life it would be travelling at about 24,000 miles an hour. Clooney and Bullock make their way over to a Russian space craft that just happens to be nearby but wouldn't you know it? The only remaining escape pod can't be used because its parachute is partially deployed. The two of them try to get into the station anyway but get tangled up in the ropes and then Clooney wanders off into space to die, wisecracking all the way. Bullock fights her way into the Russian craft and makes her way to the escape pod, ignoring the small gouts of fire that appear before her. And of course the conflagration spreads and she is forced to escape in space pod that is almost out of fuel so she can make her way to a Chinese space station around the corner with its own escape pod and and and it descends into complete incoherence. You don't know what the film wants to say. Bullock bounces off so many space craft and pulls off so many highly implausible feats that it feels like Indiana Jones.

1685053,A2Q42ON9CEHR4O,B00H83EUL2,David R. Eastwood,"[4, 4]","GRAVITY (2013) is a well-acted Science Fiction film featuring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. It  has superior special effects and is genuinely touching in 2 or 3 places ... but, sadly, it has dozens of major plot-holes I just could not overlook.The plot of GRAVITY is almost identical to that of the contemporaneous movie ALL IS LOST (2013; Robert Redford), in which an aging man making a solo sailing voyage in the Indian Ocean collides with a metal cargo container that rips a large hole in his boat. GRAVITY is quite a bit more engaging because, unlike with Redford's unnamed and taciturn character, we get to know some of the back-story of Sandra Bullock's character and do get to learn her feelings and thoughts almost non-stop ... and GRAVITY's amazingly similar concluding scene is at least 25 times more plausible than the concluding scene in ALL IS LOST.In GRAVITY, Bullock and Clooney play the two surviving members of a space shuttle that is blasted to fragments by space debris. If we think about possible outcomes while watching, only these six are possible: Bullock and/or Clooney will soon die; Bullock and/or Clooney will survive with serious injuries; Bullock and/or Clooney will survive with little or no damage. No &#34;Spoiler Alert&#34; is needed when confirming that, by the end, two of these six outcomes have been presented.As for the major plot-holes, most of them concern the orbiting space debris that not only is all moving at the same incredibly rapid velocity in an incredibly tight formation (which is implausible, given that the debris originated from an earlier collision) but its altitude above Earth happens to coincide perfectly with that of the American shuttle craft ... AND a Russian space station ... AND a Chinese space station (which is hugely implausible), AND this debris is on an absolutely perfect collision course, one after another, with all three (despite the fact that space is three dimensional, meaning there are TWO major variables besides &#34;altitude above Earth&#34; to be considered in any collision ... and the fact that virtually all orbits are elliptical, not circular, which MEANS that &#34;altitude&#34; will fluctuate in almost every object's case).FURTHER, there is the fourth variable of TIME ... and here is where a &#34;slight&#34; SPOILER WARNING is needed. I won't waste words here about the fact that the American shuttle and the Russian and Chinese space stations were all moving objects. Instead, let's consider some &#34;WHAT IF--?&#34; propositions (the kind of thing nerds of all ages like doing when reading or viewing Science Fiction / Speculative Fiction): WHAT IF Sandra Bullock's and George Clooney's characters were outside their shuttle, exposed to debris, when it destroyed their craft? And what if they were totally unharmed despite hundreds of very near misses? What, then, are the odds that (given the three dimensions of space AND the time variable) the debris would go around and around the Earth and arrive and destroy the Russian space station at almost exactly the time Bullock and/or Clooney arrived there? And WHAT IF, when Bullock and/or Clooney arrived at the Chinese space station, the EXACT SAME THING happened there at THAT time to THAT space station?I'm not NECESSARILY saying that these things DO occur in the film, but IF they do, are you prepared to ignore them?Weighing the nature of GRAVITY's story--its &#34;Admiration Plot&#34; that is designed to make us feel good when we see people being brave and resourceful when faced by an array of life-threatening situations--against the screenwriter's lamentable lack of ingenuity, and factoring in the acting, the attractiveness of Bullock and Clooney, and the wonderful special effects of the opening scenes, IF I were giving this film a letter grade, it would be a &#34;B-&#34;.",4,FINE ACTING AND GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS ...

And visuals often tell the story.I'm trying to think of any other film where visuals dominate from beginning to end to the same extent as GRAVITY.  And I'm coming up with a goose egg.  Director Alfonso Cuaron has given us a visual feast featuring one dominant player:  Earth.  As GRAVITY's story spins along--the story of two shuttle astronauts about to get caught up in an outer space bad hair day--the crystal clear, vibrant blue sphere of Earth stretches out in the background, often featuring spiraling storm clouds, or one horizon is outlined by an oncoming sunrise.  In a word, stunning.  Yet the visuals don't end with the depiction of the Earth.  GRAVITY's story is launched by a Russian satellite being destroyed, creating a debris field that takes out other satellites, creating a relentless chain reaction of destruction.  As astronauts Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) are first cast adrift from their shuttle, to making their way to the International Space Station, to subsequently attempting to seek refuge in the Chinese space station, the debris cloud stubbornly follows, cutting an extraordinary amount of damage to all spacecraft before our very eyes.  Obviously, none of the destruction is real, yet the imagery and visuals are so compelling and believable the viewer can do nothing more than tightly grip the handles of his or her chair.Finally, the visuals enhance the story of Dr. Ryan Stone, who is a reluctant space traveler at best, a novice who suddenly finds herself all alone in the vast nothingness of space.  As GRAVITY's story unfolds, we learn pieces of vital backstory about Ryan's life back on Earth; in a word, it's not been a happy one.  Yet Ryan knows one thing:  She's not ready to die, not this day, and she'll do whatever it takes to get back home.  This may be Bullock's finest performance by far, and she owes a thumbs up to her trainer; she's in miraculous shape for this role.  GRAVITY is a white-knuckle thriller presented by filmmakers at the peak of their crafts.  GRAVITY is a visual must-see, again and again and again.--D.

It has a few stretches and improbabilities, but it's hard to make a film of this sort without some of those. Comparisons have been made with2001: A Space Odyssey, but GRAVITY does not begin to hold the slightest nubbin of a candle to a classic of that stature. All the same, good performances by Bullock (Dr. Ryan Stone) and Clooney (""veteran astronaut"" Matt Kowalski), who are the only living characters we actually see here. Though the Earth below looks rather artificial, some nice use of gadgetry and special effects.I put off watching GRAVITY because it looked fairly predictable.

What makes this movie different from its many predecessors, including &#34;Marooned&#34; and &#34;Apollo 13&#34;, is the stunningly realistic recreation of being weightless in space. And somehow, the movie manages to endow this environment, poised in orbit between a colorful earth and the limitless black void of space, with a surprising degree of claustrophobia.The premise is simple. A U.S. space shuttle delivers a four-person crew to orbit to repair a satellite. Senior astronaut Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) and medical engineer (and rookie astronaut) Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) are on a spacewalk, working on the damaged satellite. Suddenly, Mission Control in Houston (the voice of Ed Harris) warns that a debris cloud from a destroyed Russian satellite is approaching at speed...The collision between debris cloud and space shuttle is catastrophic. Kowalsky and a terrified Stone find themselves in desperate straits, untethered and with few options. How their dilemma is resolved is the exciting and frightening heart of the movie, a series of action sequences that should keep most viewers glued to their seats.Bullock and Clooney do a great job in what is essentially a two-person movie.

Calling it a masterpiece and a game changer. I was like, wow, this is the Hollywood hype machine going into full throttle. Hey, I like hype as much as the next guy. I love it when people get excited about going to the movies because some cultural phenomenon is tearing it up at the box office. Ultimately, I didn't  buy into any of the hype. I just wanted to see the film.First of all, this was one of the best 3D experiences I've ever had. I've had quite a few. The finest of the lot would be &#34;Avatar&#34; and &#34;The Hobbit&#34; HFR 3D. ( I know a lot of people hate that high frame rate, 48 frames per second process that The Hobbit utilized but it made the 3D and C.G.I. remarkable ). I would place Gravity in a close 3rd place behind those two and in front of the great 3D in &#34;The Life of Pi&#34; and &#34;Hugo&#34;.The sense of depth in Gravity was amazing. The sense of weightless floating was palpable. Just as a space simulator, this film is a remarkable achievement of the first rank. This will win the Academy Award for best cinematography. Some people can't grasp how difficult some of the work was to do. This film should be recognized for the breathtaking visual feast that's on display here. The sound design was also extraordinary and deserves the highest praise.Now we get to the narrative, the story, the plot... well now... Some astronauts are working in the Earth's orbit and then.... SOMETHING GOES WRONG! That's it, that's the whole plot. I doubt that's a spoiler of any kind. It might have been interesting if nothing went wrong? I don't know, that would be an avant-garde space film! But everyone knows something has to go wrong in order for the &#34;drama&#34; to commence. And something goes wrong again and again, every 10 minutes to keep the drama moving along. This is a very straight up, bare bones thriller structure. Which is perfectly legitimate, perhaps even showcasing bravery from the creative team, to just write a simple space thriller and then focus on the technical details, the simulation experience, not on the narrative.Maybe that's why I deeply admire the film on a technical level but I don't love it. To add layers to the simple story, the film dives head first into a lot of symbolism. SPOILERS AHEAD. The endless umbilical cord imagery in the film when the astronauts are constantly entangled in one thing after another. Sandra Bullock floating like a fetus. The Earth itself as the mother of humanity and the force of gravity that draws it's wayward astronaut children back to the planet. How about Sandra Bullock emerging from the ocean at the end, like the first human or the first creature to crawl/walk on land. All the evolution imagery. Life began as stardust that floated to the Earth, was born in the oceans, then crawled onto land.  Hey, maybe this film is deep? Or maybe not.The biggest problem is that Gravity relies too much on contrived plot points to further the tension and drama. A fire breaks out here, a spacesuit rips, a space station explodes ( more than once ), oxygen is constantly running out. Yeah, it's really hard to survive in space. Life in space is impossible as the movie states. But why all this artificial drama? One problem after another? It felt like the story was stuck on wheels that couldn't naturally build momentum, the writers/director just pushed it every so often... then they'd push it again and again. It was forced and contrived, not natural storytelling. Eventually it started to get so ridiculous, that when Bullock's space capsule crashed into the ocean and she escapes into the water... I thought for sure a shark would swim by and Sandra would have to punch it in the eye and fight it off!Director Alfonso Cuaron, who co-wrote Gravity with his son... should be commended for not succumbing to Hollywood studio pressure to force Gravity to be more than what it is. The studio gave such helpful suggestions like, &#34;Cut to Houston and show NASA scrambling to save the astronauts&#34;. &#34;Cut to flashbacks of Sandra Bullock's life on Earth with her daughter&#34;. &#34;Develop a love story between the George Clooney and Sandra Bullock characters&#34;. All genius suggestions...NOT! Thankfully Cuaron was able to stick to his guns. He could have padded the running time of the film with extraneous material, but he was wise not to go that route.At the same time, it felt like a missed opportunity, because Cuaron could have gone in the opposite direction and made an avant-garde cinematic experience like 2001 or something down that road.

Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[0, 0]","""Gravity,"" directed and co-written by Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, stars Sandra Bullock as Mission Specialist Ryan Stone, George Clooney as Mission Commander Matt Kowalski, and an army of visual effects wizards. Stone and Kowalski run into a huge dose of bad luck when a communications satellite explodes and bombards their space shuttle with dangerous shrapnel. Stone and Kowalski lose contact with their controllers in Houston and are left to their own devices. Both of them know that their chances for survival are slim. Nothing further of the plot can be revealed, lest the movie be spoiled for potential viewers.Sandra Bullock delivers a gutsy and poignant performance as a brilliant but lonely scientist who has little motivation to fight against overwhelming odds. After all, she believes that no one on earth will mourn her passing. Clooney, as usual, plays a self-deprecating and wisecracking hunk, who teases Stone and prods her to hang on, no matter what.Much of the film is driven by amazing stunts, mind-boggling computer graphics, the gorgeous cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki, and constant doses of peril from fire, loss of oxygen, and that pesky space junk hurtling towards our heroes. Steven Price's pulse-pounding musical score serves as a fitting backdrop for this adrenaline-fueled film. The brief running time, a mere hour and a half, is sufficient to tell a story that is more visual than intellectual. Those who lack an advanced degree in astrophysics will have no idea if what we are seeing bears any resemblance to reality. Still, even if Cuar&oacute;n's facts are way off-base, he is a genius at eliciting a strong emotional response. We cannot help but root for Stone as she vacillates between hope and despair; her courage and vulnerability keep us enthralled.

1685147,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00H83EUL2,Ed Uyeshima,"[48, 70]","The irony of the film's title is that there isn't any, gravity that is, but that's not to say it lacks gravitas. It does in ways both unexpected and transcendent. It's been seven long years since Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's last film, 2006's emotionally propulsive thriller,Children of Men, which was a masterful work of suspense in the midst of one seriously dystopian vision of the apocalypse. Somehow, the less-than-prolific filmmaker manages to surpass that impressive work with this terrifying yet genuinely profound 2013 science-fiction thriller that buzzes by in a fleet 91 minutes. Although Ang Lee effectively used 3-D CGI effects to enhance the magical realism ofLife of Pi, I have never seen a film use them as purposefully and powerfully as Cuar&oacute;n does here within the dramatic structure of the story. Co-written with his son Jon&aacute;s, the screenplay, by contrast, is life-size in its intimacy and even with all the technical jargon, at times poetic. This combination gives the film an almost mythic reach and at the same time, brings insight into the way the human spirit works against the overwhelming emptiness of space. The story takes place about 372 miles above Earth, and the alternately ethereal and scarifying setting is captured in brilliant detail by ace cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and special effects master Tim Webber.Pay particularly close attention to the uninterrupted seventeen-minute sequence that opens the film. It's a bravura piece of cinema by anyone's standards. In brief, bio-medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone is on her first space mission studiously installing a device to fix the Hubble Space Telescope on the U.S Space Shuttle Explorer. Mission commander Matt Kowalski is a veteran astronaut who devilishly spacewalks around her in a jet pack. Mission Control reports that the Russians have blown up one of their own satellites which transforms into a massive attack of hurling debris that arrives in a matter of seconds and will continue to make an orbital return causing massive destruction every ninety minutes. There is no time for the crew to return to the shuttle much less Earth, and the damage to the craft and nearby International Space Station is extensive. It's enough to say that Stone sets off on a journey not only of physical survival but spiritual awakening as her character has been in a listless state since a senseless personal tragedy occurred back home. If you don't count the voiceovers at the beginning, there are only two actors who make up the entire cast, and they are grade-A stars who bring their personal charisma to the fore.George Clooney has the smaller of the two roles as Kowalski, and he uses his natural insouciance to great effect as his wisecracking gives way to a character who provides the knowledgably becalming tone that Stone needs at the story's most critical points. He makes one particularly risky scene work by the sheer magnitude of his character's life-affirming bravado. He also impressively wrote the scene. Even so, this is Sandra Bullock's film from start to finish, and it amazes me how she wasn't even among the top casting choices for the role (Angelina Jolie turned it down twice). Although Stone may come across as emotionally stunted, Bullock offers her natural likeability as a necessary counterbalance. However, that observation short-changes her stellar work here, especially the pure physicality of her performance. Intriguingly, her character is not that far removed from the one she played nearly twenty years earlier inWhile You Were Sleepingin that both deal with personal losses with an emotional alertness that wins us over completely. Only this time she does it with a graceful maturity that deepens the catharsis of the incredible odyssey she experiences, this in spite of a few overtly sentimental moments thrown in for good measure. Regardless, this is Cuar&oacute;n's towering cinematic achievement, and the movie truly stands on its own.",5,Cuar&oacute;n's Dazzling Space Odyssey Turns into a Cathartic Journey of the Human Spirit,1381104000,"10 7, 2013",2013,3962,"['irony', 'film', 'title', ""n't"", 'gravity', 'not', 'say', 'gravitas', 'ways', 'unexpected', 'transcendent', 'been', 'seven', 'long', 'years', 'Alfonso', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'last', 'film', '2006', 'emotionally', 'propulsive', 'thriller', 'Children', 'Men', 'was', 'masterful', 'work', 'suspense', 'midst', 'one', 'seriously', 'dystopian', 'vision', 'apocalypse', 'Somehow', 'less-than-prolific', 'filmmaker', 'surpass', 'impressive', 'work', 'terrifying', 'yet', 'genuinely', 'profound', '2013', 'science-fiction', 'thriller', 'fleet', '91', 'minutes', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'effectively', 'used', '3-D', 'CGI', 'effects', 'enhance', 'magical', 'realism', 'ofLife', 'Pi', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'use', 'purposefully', 'powerfully', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'here', 'dramatic', 'structure', 'story', 'Co-written', 'son', 'Jon', 'aacute', 'screenplay', 'contrast', 'life-size', 'intimacy', 'even', 'technical', 'jargon', 'times', 'poetic', 'combination', 'film', 'almost', 'mythic', 'reach', 'same', 'time', 'insight', 'way', 'human', 'spirit', 'works', 'overwhelming', 'emptiness', 'space', 'story', 'place', '372', 'miles', 'above', 'Earth', 'alternately', 'ethereal', 'scarifying', 'setting', 'captured', 'brilliant', 'detail', 'ace', 'cinematographer', 'Emmanuel', 'Lubezki', 'special', 'effects', 'master', 'Tim', 'Webber.Pay', 'particularly', 'close', 'attention', 'uninterrupted', 'seventeen-minute', 'sequence', 'film', 'bravura', 'piece', 'cinema', 'anyone', 'standards', 'brief', 'bio-medical', 'engineer', 'Dr.', 'Ryan', 'Stone', 'first', 'space', 'mission', 'studiously', 'installing', 'device', 'fix', 'Hubble', 'Space', 'Telescope', 'U.S', 'Space', 'Shuttle', 'Explorer', 'Mission', 'commander', 'Matt', 'Kowalski', 'veteran', 'astronaut', 'who', 'spacewalks', 'jet', 'pack', 'Mission', 'Control', 'Russians', 'have', 'blown', 'up', 'one', 'own', 'satellites', 'massive', 'attack', 'hurling', 'debris', 'matter', 'seconds', 'will', 'continue', 'make', 'orbital', 'return', 'causing', 'massive', 'destruction', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'time', 'crew', 'return', 'shuttle', 'much', 'less', 'Earth', 'damage', 'craft', 'nearby', 'International', 'Space', 'Station', 'extensive', 'enough', 'say', 'Stone', 'off', 'journey', 'not', 'only', 'physical', 'survival', 'spiritual', 'awakening', 'character', 'been', 'listless', 'state', 'senseless', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'occurred', 'back', 'home', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'voiceovers', 'beginning', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'make', 'up', 'entire', 'cast', 'are', 'grade-A', 'stars', 'who', 'bring', 'personal', 'charisma', 'fore.George', 'Clooney', 'smaller', 'two', 'roles', 'Kowalski', 'natural', 'insouciance', 'great', 'effect', 'wisecracking', 'way', 'character', 'who', 'knowledgably', 'becalming', 'tone', 'Stone', 'story', 'most', 'critical', 'points', 'one', 'particularly', 'risky', 'scene', 'work', 'sheer', 'magnitude', 'character', 'life-affirming', 'bravado', 'also', 'impressively', 'wrote', 'scene', 'Even', 'so', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'how', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'top', 'casting', 'choices', 'role', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'turned', 'down', 'twice', 'Stone', 'may', 'come', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'Bullock', 'natural', 'likeability', 'necessary', 'counterbalance', 'However', 'observation', 'stellar', 'work', 'here', 'especially', 'pure', 'physicality', 'performance', 'Intriguingly', 'character', 'not', 'far', 'removed', 'one', 'played', 'nearly', 'twenty', 'years', 'earlier', 'Were', 'Sleepingin', 'deal', 'personal', 'losses', 'emotional', 'alertness', 'over', 'completely', 'Only', 'time', 'graceful', 'maturity', 'catharsis', 'incredible', 'odyssey', 'spite', 'few', 'overtly', 'sentimental', 'moments', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'Regardless', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'towering', 'cinematic', 'achievement', 'movie', 'truly', 'own']",N/A

I don't know if this is a universally accepted way of disposing old satellites but wow, they need to stop doing this just in case.Anyhow, so basically, we just follow Sandra Bullock space station hopping until she can find an escape pod that will bring her back down to Earth.  The visual was pretty impressive.  I don't think I've ever seen anything like it but there's really no story attached to the movie.  She just moves on from one establishment to another... narrowly escaping destruction.  They try to make both characters human and introduce some background stories but didn't do much for me, really.

There is a never-ending pull of emotion on what she will do next.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that her surviving as many hurdles as she did and still making it home safely is unrealistic, but if she had died out in space, it would have been a let down and no one would like the movie as much.

I said to myself, this movie is not going to be all that great, a one-trick pony at best.Well, as it turns out, this pony has several tricks.It's very rarely that I take note of the use of sound in a movie, but I have to say that I have not been this impressed with sound since the beachhead scene in Saving Private Ryan. It really is that good. A good example in particular is one towards the last few minutes of the movie.As far as visuals go . . . I am still kicking myself for not seeing this in the theater or IMAX. I have a projector with a ~100&#34; screen and as amazing as that is I can only imagine how grand it must have been to see this on an even bigger screen. I particularly like the long, unbroken duration of many of the shots. The way the movie is presented definitely makes me feel that this is not something that could have been expressed as well in song, art, story, videogame or other mediums.I see some people complain about the plot, or lack of it. I disagree. Not every movie needs to be a three-hour epic with a cast of dozens, deep background stories and side-plots. Imagine if all of literature were 1,000 page tomes like &#34;War and Peace&#34;. How boring. So with that being said, this movie is more along the lines of an Aesop's Fable--a simple and short story with a couple memorable characters and an important message. I guess some people were expecting Lord of the Rings--in space.Ironically, there are a few literary nods in this movie. One can spot foreshadowing and even a little bit of symbolism if you pay attention.This is simply a thrilling movie to watch. More importantly, it's one of those movies I think you'll want to watch again. To paraphrase Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, &#34;Rereading . . . is what counts.&#34; When you have an strong gravitational urge to watch a movie again--even though you know how it ends, who says what and what happens when--that's when you know how good a movie really is.Finally, Gravity is a great movie partly because it takes us as close to space as most of us will ever get . . . and at a fraction of the price offered by billionaires with bad hair.",5,THE FORCE IS STRONG WITH THIS ONE . . .,1394064000,"03 6, 2014",2014,2353,"['[', 'NO', 'SPOILERS', ']', 'are', 'times', 'wish', 'could', 'take', 'words', 'back.I', 'remember', 'seeing', 'trailers', 'thinking', 'time', 'how', 'earth', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'protagonists', 'are', 'stranded', 'space', 'so', 'early', 'said', 'myself', 'movie', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'one-trick', 'pony', 'best.Well', 'out', 'pony', 'several', 'tricks.It', 'very', 'rarely', 'take', 'note', 'use', 'sound', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'impressed', 'sound', 'beachhead', 'scene', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'really', 'good', 'good', 'example', 'particular', 'one', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'movie.As', 'far', 'visuals', 'go', 'am', 'still', 'kicking', 'not', 'seeing', 'theater', 'IMAX', 'have', 'projector', '~100', '34', 'screen', 'as', 'amazing', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'grand', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'see', 'even', 'bigger', 'screen', 'particularly', 'long', 'unbroken', 'duration', 'many', 'shots', 'way', 'movie', 'presented', 'definitely', 'feel', 'not', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'expressed', 'as', 'well', 'song', 'art', 'story', 'videogame', 'other', 'mediums.I', 'see', 'people', 'complain', 'plot', 'lack', 'disagree', 'Not', 'movie', 'be', 'three-hour', 'epic', 'cast', 'dozens', 'deep', 'background', 'stories', 'side-plots', 'Imagine', 'literature', 'were', '1,000', 'page', 'tomes', '34', 'War', 'Peace', '34', 'How', 'boring', 'So', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'more', 'lines', 'Aesop', 'Fable', 'simple', 'short', 'story', 'couple', 'memorable', 'characters', 'important', 'message', 'guess', 'people', 'were', 'expecting', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'space.Ironically', 'are', 'few', 'literary', 'nods', 'movie', 'One', 'can', 'spot', 'foreshadowing', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'symbolism', 'pay', 'attention.This', 'simply', 'thrilling', 'movie', 'watch', 'More', 'importantly', 'one', 'movies', 'think', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'paraphrase', 'Argentine', 'writer', 'Jorge', 'Luis', 'Borges', '34', 'Rereading', 'what', 'counts.', '34', 'When', 'have', 'strong', 'gravitational', 'urge', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'even', 'know', 'how', 'who', 'what', 'what', 'when', 'when', 'know', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'really', 'is.Finally', 'Gravity', 'great', 'movie', 'partly', 'close', 'space', 'most', 'will', 'ever', 'get', 'fraction', 'price', 'offered', 'billionaires', 'bad', 'hair']",N/A

The character has to struggle against dangers in space as well as her own personal demons, giving her a surprising amount of depth.However, I read this book soon after I readThe Martian: A Novel, and I couldn't help but draw comparisons, most of which don't work in Gravity's favor. Like Gravity, the Martian is a sci-fi thriller about a stranded astronaut. However, unlike that novel, Gravity sometimes plays fast and loose with the science. There are many scenes which work great in a visual medium but are utterly unrealistic (astronauts navigating through a rapidly approaching debris field on a ""Rocketeer style"" jetpack comes to mind). These ""Hollywood"" moments probably made the film a commercial success, but took me out of the film all too often.Perhaps I'm using too high a standard by which to judge the film.

1685174,A2MEPR41IMURZA,B00H83EUL2,Eric Hutchins,"[3, 5]","Inevitably, there will be those how nit-pick this or that aspect of this very realistic, minimalist film. I, on the other hand, found it surprisingly good. Why reviewers have made mention that Sandra was not the first or, allegedly, even the fifth actress offered this part is entirely beyond me. Of the names mentioned that were offered the part before her, I believe, going in, she would have done a better job than any of them. As it turns out she did an excellent, completely credible job. An attractive 50 years of age, she is credible in the role in ways that the younger actresses simply would not have been. If you've seen the film, can you imagine Scarlet Johansen doing as good a job in this role?Also, I think it was a particularly gutsy move to kill off the male lead... and the minimalism of both the plot and the number of actors in this film attests to how strong it had to be artistically in order to pull off its high entertainment value. For me, this film is strong and would pair particularly well as a double feature with ""The Abyss."" After the film, I was moved to reflect that space may be a necessary playground for scientists, but it will remain far too technical and dangerous (much less expensive)to think that even semi-ordinary people will end up there on holiday anytime in the foreseeable future.Finally, I particularly appreciate a science fiction movie with such a strong human element. The movie is a human drama set in near-earth orbit instead of the typical SciFi where machines, unbelievable action stunts, and spectacular visuals must carry the audience. Thanks to George Clooney's journeyman performance and Sandra Bullock's dogged determination to keep it real, this film earns a place in my SciFi library when many other alleged ""block-busters"" have and will not. See the film on its own terms, and look past the surface panoramas. The last scene when Sandra digs her fingers into the wet sand of terra firma ""again for the first time"" says it all.",5,Surprisingly Good...,1381104000,"10 7, 2013",2013,1988,"['Inevitably', 'will', 'be', 'how', 'nit-pick', 'aspect', 'very', 'realistic', 'minimalist', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'found', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Why', 'reviewers', 'have', 'made', 'mention', 'Sandra', 'was', 'not', 'first', 'allegedly', 'even', 'fifth', 'actress', 'offered', 'part', 'entirely', 'names', 'mentioned', 'were', 'offered', 'part', 'believe', 'going', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'out', 'did', 'excellent', 'completely', 'credible', 'job', 'attractive', '50', 'years', 'age', 'credible', 'role', 'ways', 'younger', 'actresses', 'simply', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'can', 'imagine', 'Scarlet', 'Johansen', 'doing', 'as', 'good', 'job', 'role', 'Also', 'think', 'was', 'particularly', 'gutsy', 'move', 'kill', 'off', 'male', 'lead', 'minimalism', 'plot', 'number', 'actors', 'film', 'how', 'strong', 'had', 'be', 'artistically', 'order', 'pull', 'off', 'high', 'entertainment', 'value', 'film', 'strong', 'would', 'pair', 'particularly', 'well', 'double', 'feature', 'Abyss', 'film', 'was', 'moved', 'reflect', 'space', 'may', 'be', 'necessary', 'playground', 'scientists', 'will', 'remain', 'far', 'too', 'technical', 'dangerous', 'much', 'less', 'expensive', 'think', 'even', 'semi-ordinary', 'people', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'there', 'holiday', 'anytime', 'foreseeable', 'future.Finally', 'particularly', 'appreciate', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'strong', 'human', 'element', 'movie', 'human', 'drama', 'set', 'near-earth', 'orbit', 'instead', 'typical', 'SciFi', 'where', 'machines', 'unbelievable', 'action', 'stunts', 'spectacular', 'visuals', 'must', 'carry', 'audience', 'Thanks', 'George', 'Clooney', 'journeyman', 'performance', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'dogged', 'determination', 'keep', 'real', 'film', 'place', 'SciFi', 'library', 'when', 'many', 'other', 'alleged', 'block-busters', 'have', 'will', 'not', 'See', 'film', 'own', 'terms', 'look', 'surface', 'panoramas', 'last', 'scene', 'when', 'Sandra', 'fingers', 'wet', 'sand', 'terra', 'firma', 'again', 'first', 'time']",N/A

I liked it a lot, but, now that I've calmed down, separating the movie form the experience has proven challenging.Here's the scoop. There's a space shuttle mission in space. The Russian's have blown up one of their satellites and the ensuing metal storm is taking out everything in its path. Next thing you know, the space shuttle and all the crew save for Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are dead. They now must fight to survive and make it back to mama earth.This is a remarkable effort. I had the pleasure of seeing it in Imax 3-D (a first for me) and you feel as though you're in outer space with them. I've seen any number of sci-fi movies set in space but this tops them all in driving home the the sense of expanse, quiet menace, no sense of up or down and zero room for screwing up. The story is good enough. It's a 'Murphy's Law' scenario where one bad thing leads to another right up to the final breath stealing moment. Like ""Apollo 13"" you have people in peril in outer space. As good as ""Apollo 13"" is, this tops it on the tech side. SO much attention is paid to detail here. Small things, like seeing the various reflections in the visors of Clooney and Bullock. Bullock's tears floating away from her face as she thinks all is lost. There are a million little things like that that would take repeat viewings to pull in. Bullock is her usual good self here and she comprises a lion's share of the time. But the kudos have to go to director Alfonso Cuaron. He has a remarkable vision here and managed it with near flawlessness. His ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is one of the best in the series. And his ""Children of Men"" is one of my all time favorite films. I can't wait to see what he does next.Like I said. The story is good enough, but it needs to be seen for the sheer level of achievement. Few movies come along that shake you to your bones like this does. If you still want to reclaim a lost sense of wonderment, this should do it for you.",4,A Good Movie.

The horrifying incident leaves the two of them stranded some 300 miles above the Earth's surface, with only their spacesuits for protection against the airless and soundless vacuum of the void.Their only hope for survival is to reach the International Space Station.  The trouble is, however, that the debris field caused by the satellite explosion has created a chain effect of other satellites and space platforms being destroyed in orbit, creating a massive swath of debris that keeps hurtling at them at thousands of miles per hour.  And some of that debris has indeed destroyed the I.S.S., and killed most of the crew.  Clooney sacrifices himself in order to get Bullock into the remaining Soyuz escape pod still attached to the I.S.S.; but again, complications arise.  Only after a hair-raising, eye-popping dilemma does Bullock get into the pod and head for the nearby Chinese space station, which itself has suffered tremendous damage.  Bullock, understandably in a huge panic, has only a limited amount of time before she gets into the Chinese escape pod and survives the intense heat of re-entry, not to mention another debris field created by the Chinese space station as it re-enters the atmosphere.Whether seen in the regular wide screen format, in 3-D, or in the specialized IMAX 3-D (where it would share a further comparison with the 1987 IMAX documentary about the space shuttle program, THE DREAM IS ALIVE), GRAVITY succeeds as great science fiction; and while it is at times overwhelmed with the 3-D process and the avalanche of special CGI effects (though the budget stayed at under $80 million), the effects don't overshadow the storyline or the characters, which is a marked and refreshing contrast from most Hollywood big-budget spectacles of the 21st century.  Cuaron co-wrote the screenplay with his son Jonas; and although some of the situations don't conform so much to the reality of space as they do to a slightly clich&eacute;d Hollywood version of it (something that Stanley Kubrick avoided extremely successfully in ""2001""), overall the end result is a film that has a lot of the grace of ""2001"", the extreme tension of MAROONED, and the high-stakes terror of APOLLO 13, films that it can stand up to comparison quite well.  Clooney and Bullock (the latter especially so, since she must carry most of the movie on her own in a way she's not had to do since, probably, SPEED in 1994) give very solid performances here.  And perhaps as a nod to APOLLO 13, Cuaron cast Ed Harris, who portrayed NASA flight director Gene Kranz in that movie, as the off-screen voice of Mission Control here.The final result in GRAVITY is one of the best science fiction movies of recent years, and clearly a film to be relished as one of the best for 2013.",5,GRAVITY: Into The Void With One Of The Best Films Of 2013,1381190400,"10 8, 2013",2013,3705,"['been', 'awfully', 'long', 'time', 'honest-to-goodness', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'one', ""n't"", 'involve', 'robot', 'monsters', 'aliens', 'comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'like', 'been', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'have', 'one', 'form', 'Mexican-born', 'director', 'Alfonso', 'Cuaron', 'hour-and-a-half', 'opus', 'GRAVITY.Probably', 'original', 'realistic', 'film', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'set', 'vastness', 'space', 'even', 'just', 'Earth', 'atmosphere', 'Hollywood', 'made', 'films', '2001', 'SPACE', 'ODYSSEY', 'MAROONED', 'APOLLO', '13', 'films', 'quite', 'strikingly', 'times', 'GRAVITY', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'George', 'Clooney', 'astronauts', 'doing', 'routine', 'repair', 'job', 'Hubble', 'Space', 'Telescope', 'who', 'find', 'middle', 'crisis', 'when', 'huge', 'debris', 'field', 'created', 'accidental', 'missile', 'hit', 'Russian', 'satellite', 'space', 'shuttle', 'telescope', 'remaining', 'shuttle', 'crew', 'horrifying', 'incident', 'two', 'stranded', '300', 'miles', 'Earth', 'surface', 'only', 'spacesuits', 'protection', 'airless', 'soundless', 'vacuum', 'void.Their', 'only', 'hope', 'survival', 'reach', 'International', 'Space', 'Station', 'trouble', 'however', 'debris', 'field', 'caused', 'satellite', 'explosion', 'created', 'chain', 'effect', 'other', 'satellites', 'space', 'platforms', 'being', 'destroyed', 'orbit', 'creating', 'massive', 'swath', 'debris', 'hurtling', 'thousands', 'miles', 'hour', 'debris', 'indeed', 'destroyed', 'I.S.S.', 'killed', 'most', 'crew', 'Clooney', 'order', 'get', 'Bullock', 'remaining', 'Soyuz', 'escape', 'pod', 'still', 'attached', 'I.S.S', 'again', 'complications', 'arise', 'Only', 'hair-raising', 'eye-popping', 'dilemma', 'Bullock', 'get', 'pod', 'head', 'nearby', 'Chinese', 'space', 'station', 'suffered', 'tremendous', 'damage', 'Bullock', 'understandably', 'huge', 'panic', 'only', 'limited', 'amount', 'time', 'Chinese', 'escape', 'pod', 'intense', 'heat', 're-entry', 'not', 'mention', 'debris', 'field', 'created', 'Chinese', 'space', 'station', 'atmosphere.Whether', 'seen', 'regular', 'wide', 'screen', 'format', '3-D', 'specialized', 'IMAX', '3-D', 'where', 'would', 'share', 'further', 'comparison', '1987', 'IMAX', 'documentary', 'space', 'shuttle', 'program', 'THE', 'DREAM', 'IS', 'ALIVE', 'GRAVITY', 'great', 'science', 'fiction', 'times', 'overwhelmed', '3-D', 'process', 'avalanche', 'special', 'CGI', 'effects', 'budget', 'stayed', '80', 'million', 'effects', 'do', ""n't"", 'overshadow', 'storyline', 'characters', 'marked', 'refreshing', 'contrast', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'big-budget', 'spectacles', '21st', 'century', 'Cuaron', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'son', 'Jonas', 'situations', 'do', ""n't"", 'conform', 'so', 'much', 'reality', 'space', 'do', 'slightly', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'something', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'avoided', 'extremely', 'successfully', '2001', 'end', 'result', 'film', 'lot', 'grace', '2001', 'extreme', 'tension', 'MAROONED', 'high-stakes', 'terror', 'APOLLO', '13', 'films', 'can', 'stand', 'up', 'comparison', 'quite', 'well', 'Clooney', 'Bullock', 'latter', 'especially', 'so', 'must', 'carry', 'most', 'movie', 'own', 'way', 'not', 'had', 'do', 'probably', 'SPEED', '1994', 'give', 'very', 'solid', 'performances', 'here', 'perhaps', 'nod', 'APOLLO', '13', 'Cuaron', 'cast', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'who', 'portrayed', 'NASA', 'flight', 'director', 'Gene', 'Kranz', 'movie', 'off-screen', 'voice', 'Mission', 'Control', 'final', 'result', 'GRAVITY', 'one', 'best', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'recent', 'years', 'clearly', 'film', 'be', 'relished', 'one', 'best', '2013']",N/A

The eye becomes fixed on the incredible cinematography, not to mention the first 10 minutes of the film being a single, uncut scene - a scene comprised entirely of special effects, since it was not actually filmed in space (hard to believe when you're watching it). Besides the film being a visual vortex that keeps the viewer in a state of almost constant anxiety, its audio effects are nearly as powerful. Blending anticipated sounds with the absolute silence of space is a stunning effect in itself. Most critics seemed to think the film's one weakness was a lack of story, but I disagree. The story is as subtle and profound as the effects are mystifying and breath-taking.

Once the disaster hits, and it is jolting, about 10 minutes in or so, we go along with Dr. Stone as she fights to stay alive. It is a true odyssey. It is masterful. It is achingly beautiful at times, with just the right touches of poignancy. The music is just right and never overpowers the film. The direction is amazing.There are three films that have put me in space. 2001, Apollo 13 and Gravity.Clooney gives a wonderful performance as the mission commander, Kowalski that gets little attention as it is a supporting role. But I can't think of an actor I would rather have.Sandra Bullock gives her finest performance in Gravity. She is transcendent. The last such powerful performance by a woman in a SF film was given by Sigourney Weaver in Aliens. I doubt she will win for best actress at the Oscars. She should. But while this is the type of film that may occasionally get acting recognition, it is always deemed enough simply to be nominated. Not enough to me. Bullock should win.The same goes for the film and the director.It's odd to see so many people disliking this film.

EVERYTHING in space is destroyed...the shuttle...the International Space Station...all the international stations...satellites, etc.  Since all these films are NASA-backed, what was the point...unless they really intend to do this and are just getting people used to the idea. In the last scene as the sole survivor crawls out of the water onto a beach and takes a handful of mud, the message is that Mother Earth is more important than technology. Every time the shuttle took off, all I could think about was that the fuel and preparation alone was costing the taxpayer one billion (not a million) dollars for EACH launch. The Shuttle program was scrapped because it was too expensive for what it was accomplishing and everything was antiquated (analog rather than digital technology). More than likely they want to do the same thing with the ISS for the same reason.Let's look at the history of NASA.*NASA has consistently lied to the public about everything it has ever done, while stealing the taxpayer's money.*NASA is NOT a civilian agency, but part of the Department of D*fense and everything it has ever done has to do with military missions.*According to some writers NASA is linked with satanic cults.*NASA knew after the first moon walk that both the Moon and Mars were populated by an alien race  (although perhaps a million years in the past) and covered it up and lied about it; perhaps killing JFK because he was going public about it.*80% of all humans on planet Earth have themselves witnessed UFO's; but NASA, the DOD and the Air Farce continue with deniability.*All satellites launched by NASA (and now other countries to stay even) have to do with military surveillance and communication, and US citizens are subjected to identical scrutiny. Cell phone use is pushed for GPS locatability in population control and to continue propaganda of horrible sub-standard TV programming.If there is another World War, the first thing that will happen is that ALL satellites and space objects will be shot out of the sky by various oppositions; putting us back to Morse code for communication and local TV.You have no idea what they're going to do with the billions and trillions of dollars they steal from you.  The Earth is completely polluted; people are dying from floods and other cataclysms, but they want to spend trillions of dollars to go to Mars in hopes of getting more technology to kill people in new ways, instead of using these monies to clean up our planet!If you were an alien race and you had infiltrated Earth populations, where would you be?

However, I think the premise is made pretty clear - it's a film about two people who end up stranded in orbit around Earth.How this unfolds and what they do is at times ordinary, at times extraordinary, and at times mystical.  It might help to view this as a science fiction classic fairy tale.  Many of the greatest scifi short stories have embraced characteristics and topics which are reflected in this film.  Rather than futuristic worlds or amazing technologies, it explores a crisis that initiates a series of terrifying challenges affecting real people doing real space jobs.The film is neither entirely straightforward, or entirely symbolic; it mixes both elements.  I think that is part of the difficulty some people have with it as well.  You have to get into the concept that &#34;real life&#34; in space is going to feel less than real, dreamlike.  Okay I say that not having been in space, but I've been in weightlessness a few times, as well as in other pretty dramatic aerial environments and maneuvers.  Those places and activities put you into an altered state of consciousness no matter how hard you try not to be.  Even the simplest thing, like bright light, or an individual color, takes on a surprisingly God-like force in your awareness quite easily.  I think that this film captures that state of mind.I didn't go into this expecting scientific perfection; I never approach any film that way, it's pointless.  These are stories, not training films.

It manages to tell an impossibly simple story about surviving and not surviving astronauts out in space and makes the emotions so complex that the audience is left speechless. It is a staggering achievement.Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a brilliant medical engineer on her first shuttle mission, with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) in command of his last flight before retiring. But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone - tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness. How eventually Stone manipulates the fragments of international spacecraft in her attempt to live is profoundly touching and extraordinarily touching.Both Bullock and Clooney offer portraits not only of the characters they portray but also the hopes and fears of us all if ever faced with surviving the impossible.

Who cares about accuracy and education with our fantasy?1. Anyone who has watched NASA TV broadcasts of shuttle/Hubble/ISS walks will laugh at all the stupid dialogue that this movie pushes forward as a reality.2. The Russians, as joint participants, would never use a missile to experimentally blow up a satellite close to any working space endeavor. Further, there are much easier ways to allow a satellite to de-orbit and burn. And, if it was to test missile capability against satellites, again there are much easier ways of doing that.3. Although space junk and meteors, asteroids, comets, etc. can reach relative speeds in the tens of thousands of mph it is far fetched to have so much debris accumulatively arrive together and so quickly.4. Velocity and acceleration is far more fine tunable with pressurized gas from a MMU so all that flying about was a ""bit"" excessive. Even the movement by hand was unrealistically excessive.5. The continuous and at times nonsensical talking out loud dialogue by Bullock would seem comical to anyone who has faced dangerous situations.6. Clooney's sudden appearance scene towards the end was far fetched.7. The tumbling escape module, all aflame; the heat tiles just on one side so they are rarely in a position to insulate. The end result should have left her as a very burnt cinder.8. The coincidental landing in a lake; the removal of her space suit deep under water.

1685282,AZC6QCRFOP9HV,B00H83EUL2,Henry E. Dorfman,"[5, 7]","The movie opens with astronauts space walking outside their space shuttle to repair a satellite. Actually, Stone (Bullock) the scientist is working while Kowalski (Clooney) is wisecracking and looping around, inexplicably squandering the precious resource of his propellant. They receive a warning of an approaching cloud of debris which can shred them, so they dawdle around a little more.Not that it matters because said debris severely damages their ship and kills the rest of their crew. As luck would have it, there are two space stations close by, so Kowalski attaches a tether to Stone and sets sail for the closer of the two. Having wasted his propellant, it&#8217;s a predictable close call, with Stone exhausting her air supply. They clang and grab, clang and grab, clang and grab at the station, a scene that will be repeated ad nauseum throughout the movie. Stone latches onto the last possible hold on the station, naturally, with Kowalski barely in tow. He claims the force of his inertia (no movement and weightlessness &#8211; what force?) will pull them both off and inexplicably sacrifices himself by releasing the tether, instructing her to make her way to the air lock. She&#8217;s out of air, but pauses a protracted period to gaze around and contemplate before doing so.Once inside, she immediately sheds her spacesuit to reveal her clingy tank top and short shorts. The entire astronaut contingent  are clad in elaborate temperature control suits under their spacesuits but she&#8217;s dressed as though a splashdown at Venice Beach is a probability. This extended scene will be repeated, revealing the puerile mentality of the movie. You have a sheet of metal between you and an airless and heat-free environment and you can&#8217;t wait to shed your protective gear at every opportunity.

There are several scenes with debris crashing into the vessel and a fire starts on the ship: like that has never been done before.  The main character becomes delusional but in the end makes a snap decision to ensure survival.  Is that not the premise of most space thrillers in which people are stuck in space?The only reason why such a rendition of this age old story works for Gravity is due to the heroine not actually being a heroine but an incompetent and suicidal woman who has not yet completely given up on life.  In a nonchalant delivery; back story and character development is given in which viewers learn Bulluck's character never passed her flight simulator, has a lost child, has no loved ones, but holds a doctorate.  Presumably, a doctorate is all that is needed to make into space for this film.  Because very early in the story it is revealed that Bulluck's character does not follow orders and is very unobservant of her peers.  This is where the film's logic completely is swept away for competent viewers would question how did Bulluck's character ever get cleared to go on the mission?  In real life Bulluck's character never would have been allowed to go due to: employer's notes of incompetency during her training, disregard for orders, and a psych eval stating she's suicidal.And why after over a decade of viewing strong competent females from sci-fi/fantasy films/TV including: The Matrix, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Stargate SG-1, and The Hunger Games; are viewers presented with a female lead that is incompetent, unobservant, and suicidal???Because the writers and produces practice Misogyny?  That is the only reasonable explanation because competent writers and producers would have realized that in the year 2013: women should be competent, pensive, observant, and independent.  And those writers/producers would realize that the story and perils of Gravity are so illogical that only a stupid, self hating, person could be the star: it should have been the male character portrayed by George Clooney.Gravity is a slap in the face to viewers expecting a good, logical, and probable story that caters to the ideals of gender equality.

Director Cuaron is an absolute master of incredibly impressive camera moves and filming setups (take a look at Children of Men if you enjoy these) and Gravity shows off a good dozen or so shots that you simply have never seen before. After a while, you lose all sense of direction and spatial awareness and it conveys a remarkable feeling of what total weightlessness might feel like, trumping Apollo 13 and all those that have gone before it. It's a truly magnificent visual feat that anyone with a technical interest in film will love - I rewatched several scenes a few times and bored my wife with my commentary.That said, there's absolutely no substance to the story which tries to champion the will of the human spirit and the decision to choose life over despair. Very admirable notions indeed, but ideas that fizzle in this very, very thin plot that struggles to fill 90 minutes. Bullock is excellent at carrying the weight of the script (excuse the pun) and Clooney is Clooney, bouncing around space with his usual swagger until he makes a not-very-convincing decision about 30 minutes into the flick.Whereas Children of Men was a fully fledged story with subtlely, density and believable back stories, Gravity puts Bullock's doctor character into space to change graphics cards and then fumble around for 90 minutes to avoid being blitzed by the debris from a Russian missile. NASA enthusiasts will yawn at the depictions of orbits, debris and weightlessness and for a film that gets all the visuals right, it's a shame they didn't make a couple of calls to the boys at the space agency to fact-check the action scenes.I really, really wanted to love this film.

I suppose Alfonso Cuaron wanted to create something visceral that would give us a better sense of what it is like in space, but the result is basically Speed in space with George Clooney in place of Keanu Reeves.  Poor Sandra Bullock is left bouncing off one satellite after another until she finally manages to get inside a Chinese capsule for her descent back to earth.  Clooney more or less helps guide her in what amounts to little more than a fevered dream.You get little sense of any of the characters or what their purpose in space is.  It seems set in the past as the United States is still using space shuttles, which it scuttled 3 years ago.  Yet, the Chinese appear to have a space station, which is not set to be put into orbit until 2020.  So your guess is as good as mine when the action takes place.

For many movies, the whole 3-D part is something of a gimmick, but not so much in this one.  Yes, there are a few of those stock film shots when something flies by your head, but in general, you find yourself forgetting the fact its 3-D as you get absorbed in the story.  And the story is absorbing.You shouldn't expect a large cast on this one.  In fact, it's a tiny cast.  The vast majority of the story (no spoilers) takes place in space.  But unlike Apollo 13 and other space movies, there is no real development of mission control.  Instead you get what's essentially a real time story about a horrific accident in space and the efforts of the crew to survive.George Clooney plays a great role.  He's a career astronaut and an experienced hand.  On the surface he's a bit of a clown. Underneath he's all business. Using a mix of jokes and distractions, he tries to maintain the calm among the crew while desperately struggling to get control of the situation.Sandra Bullock is the scientist in the crew.  She doesn't seem to be too thrilled about being in space but she's there to do an important job, and so she tolerates it.  If you've seen Sandra in other movies, expect something a little different this time.  Yes, she still has a bit of the quirky nature you'd expect but this is not fun and games.  It's a survival role, and unlike Clooney, she's not clowning around.This is very much a character driven story.  However, the plotline is pretty riveting too if you don't get hung up on technical details.  This isn't a documentary, so don't expect perfection.  The cinematography is something of a mixed bag.  At times it's fantastic--as good as any I've seen.  At other times they seem to lose the grip, and it can look a big contrived and cartoonish.The bottom line?  So long as you don't hung up on the technical flaws, I think you'll be entertained by fresh story that isn't formulaic.  And if you let go a bit, you'll lose yourself in a space adventure that gives you a birdeye view from space.  I'm confident that most who make the trip will be glad they saw this one in the theaters.  It's that good.  Maybe not quite five stars -- but for me, it's definitely the best movie I've seen this year.",4,Let Gravity pull you in,1385164800,"11 23, 2013",2013,2326,"['60', 'No', 'spoilers', '62', '3D', 'tickets', 'theaters', 'are', ""n't"", 'cheap', 'days', 'Gravity', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'many', 'movies', 'whole', '3-D', 'part', 'something', 'gimmick', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'Yes', 'are', 'few', 'stock', 'film', 'shots', 'when', 'something', 'flies', 'head', 'general', 'find', 'forgetting', 'fact', '3-D', 'get', 'absorbed', 'story', 'story', 'absorbing.You', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'large', 'cast', 'one', 'fact', 'tiny', 'cast', 'vast', 'majority', 'story', 'spoilers', 'place', 'space', 'Apollo', '13', 'other', 'space', 'movies', 'real', 'development', 'mission', 'control', 'Instead', 'get', 'what', 'essentially', 'real', 'time', 'story', 'horrific', 'accident', 'space', 'efforts', 'crew', 'survive.George', 'Clooney', 'great', 'role', 'career', 'astronaut', 'experienced', 'hand', 'surface', 'bit', 'clown', 'business', 'Using', 'mix', 'jokes', 'distractions', 'maintain', 'calm', 'crew', 'desperately', 'struggling', 'get', 'control', 'situation.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'scientist', 'crew', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'too', 'thrilled', 'being', 'space', 'there', 'do', 'important', 'job', 'so', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Sandra', 'other', 'movies', 'expect', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'time', 'Yes', 'still', 'bit', 'quirky', 'nature', ""'d"", 'expect', 'not', 'fun', 'games', 'survival', 'role', 'Clooney', 'not', 'clowning', 'around.This', 'very', 'much', 'character', 'driven', 'story', 'However', 'plotline', 'pretty', 'riveting', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hung', 'up', 'technical', 'details', ""n't"", 'documentary', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'perfection', 'cinematography', 'something', 'mixed', 'bag', 'times', 'fantastic', 'as', 'good', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'times', 'seem', 'lose', 'grip', 'can', 'look', 'big', 'contrived', 'cartoonish.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'So', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'hung', 'up', 'technical', 'flaws', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'entertained', 'fresh', 'story', ""n't"", 'formulaic', 'let', 'go', 'bit', ""'ll"", 'lose', 'space', 'adventure', 'birdeye', 'view', 'space', ""'m"", 'confident', 'most', 'who', 'make', 'trip', 'will', 'be', 'glad', 'saw', 'one', 'theaters', 'good', 'Maybe', 'not', 'quite', 'five', 'stars', 'definitely', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year']",N/A

As an artist, can I paint a picture of a star and take credit for its beauty?  I have seen NASA&#8217;s orbital pictures of the earth and they are ten times more beautiful than anything Alfonso Cuaron created on the screen.  He did a good job of imitation, but the real thing is always better.Most of the movie critics seem to love the movie, &#34;Gravity,&#34; or maybe they said it should win for best picture because they were afraid to criticize it.  I simply do not get it.  The special effects were fantastic!  Yes, I agree, but&#8230;the plot was so simple it failed to hold my attention for any length of time.  I kept waiting, and waiting for a subplot...throw me a George Clooney &#8220;bone,&#8221; anything.  Sandra Bullock (one of my favorite actors) had very little to do, or say in the film and kept whining, and whining throughout most of the movie.  I guess I just wanted her to be more &#34;professional,&#34; or tough like the Sigourney Weaver's character in &#34;Aliens.&#34;  In 2014, most movie directors show women &#8220;tough&#8221; and capable of dealing with any adversity.  Perhaps Latin director, Cuaron, does not think women are &#8220;liberated&#8221; enough to be responsible for their own safety.As most, I too was disappointed in the lack of reality in the movie.  I am no astrophysics major, but I have learned that one does not float from one orbital level to another orbital level so easily.  If that were possible, our high orbiting satellites would drift away into outer space towards the moon.  Even if they could&#8230;all objects orbiting around the earth are traveling at a &#8220;fixed&#8221; rate of speed around the earth and therefore the &#34;space junk&#34; would not be able to catch up with Sandra Bullock every few hours&#8230;as if she were standing still on earth waiting for it to hit her.Towards the end of this pitifully &#8220;short&#8221; film, I was so disappointed to see George Clooney, the only responsible character in the movie, drift off into oblivion.  I kept hoping the camera would follow him.  At least his rescue could have been a subplot.

Practically from the first, spacewalkers George Clooney and Sandra Bullock (who cares about their character names?) were pummeled and tossed about like toys in the vastness of space. After their ship is disabled, they need to make it to nearby space vehicles if they are to have any chance to survive. We learn about halfway through the story that Bullock has endured a personal tragedy, explaining a) why she is so mopey and b) why we should care whether she makes it back to Earth or not. But the real star of the show is the effects. Somehow, evidently without using the Vomit Comet or hanging actors from strings, the movie makers perfectly capture the physics of working in space. Cables float around, spinning objects just keep spinning and satellites adjust their course with silent jets of gas. It's a marvelous, and completely convincing illusion of the perils that astronauts endure.As for the hokey personal growth story, with its tacked on tug at the heartstrings? Meh.

Mission Control abruptly warns them to go back inside the shuttle since the Russians have blown up one of their own satellites and unleashed a massive debris field that lies in their path. They are subjected to some very rough treatment once the debris hits, and they never make it back into the shuttle which is essentially destroyed. Dr. Stone's tether snaps and she spins out of control for a nauseatingly long period of time before Matt reaches her and attaches her to his space suit. The drama continues from there. They are in a life and death struggle in the most inhospitable environment possible - deep space where there is no gravity and no oxygen and no one to call if you're in a jam.There's not much else I can report about the action without spoiling the plot, but it is at times intense and nerve-wracking. The special effects are superb. I would love to see a &#34;making of the movie&#34; documentary, but no bonus features were included on the DVD. The scenes inside the destroyed space ships are apocalyptic, and the views of beautiful earth from many miles above are just breathtaking.There are only two actors in the film, other than a few other voice overs, and Bullock has the lion's share of dialogue and acting.

1685423,A1H1C2UZ6FH0YL,B00H83EUL2,Johnfourtytwo,"[3, 14]","I went into the Imax theater expecting Apollo 13/2001 type entertainment. Instead I got a couple ""A"" list actors reciting a script.Before the entertainment starts you have a retiring astronaut leisurely flying around the shuttle with no purpose only have as much fun before he returns home to never return to space again. This is quite normal for military pilots to have a last thrill ride before retiring or separating from the service but to burn up so much screen time with these antics seemed to me the writers and producers were trying to burn up screen time from the beginning.Then you have a mission specialist who specializes in whining and crying about keeping her last meal down; again quite the norm for astronauts but why spend so much time with the norm.A few minutes later Houston informs them about the satellite target practice. Missiom Specialist asks if she should be worried but Mr. Silver Fox tells her that Houston will do the worrying for them. A few more minutes of Mr. Fox cruising around the shuttle and Ms. Specialist holding down her cookies the feces hits the rotary device.After the onslaught of debris which kills everyone but these two and renders the shuttle useless as a reentry vehicle they try to make a plan.Instead of the bungee tether dance which used way too much fuel (not to mention all the fuel he wasted during his pre-catastrophe joy ride) they should have held onto each other preferably with him holding her in front so he could drive and navigate to the conveniently parked International Space Station. This resulted in disaster for him because he felt she couldn't save him after slamming into ISS deadstick because they ran out of fuel. She was tangled up in wires and he was still connected to her via tether but he felt he couldn't be saved so he unhooked his tether and he floated away.She makes it inside, strips down to her astro undies and floats around trying to get the radio to work. In a few minutes the ISS is approaching the debris field again and she makes it to the Soyuz capsule only because there was an unrelated fire that was started on ISS. Remember she's in her undies and she's getting into another spaceship with no spacesuit. As the debris rains down on ISS she has enough time to quickly go through the simple checklist in Russian and undock. Unfortunately the shroud lines from the chute has her all tangled up so she has to do a spacewalk in this debris rainstorm and cut the Soyuz loose, fortunately the Russians left a spare cosmonaut spacesuit in the capsule.After cutting free she gets underway for the Chinese space station that's in the neighborhood around the corner. She makes it to the Chinese space station and changes capsules because the ISS Soyuz doesn't have a chute. After getting away she discovers the Chinese capsule doesn't have any fuel to fire the retro rockets so she can come back home. So she starts getting weepy eyed and cuts her oxygen and takes a nap. End of movie.Nope she wakes up due to Mr. Fox tapping on the window. She has her helmet off but he opens the door anyway so she holds her breath until he closes the door and it repressurizes. They have a talk about the school of hard knocks and he asks her if she thought about the maneuvering thrusters which has plenty of fuel to execute the deorbit burn. After a few more comments she has an epiphany and wakes up. She looks around and Mr. Fox is no longer there. Realizing it was a dream, she turns the oxygen back on, and starts the deorbit burn with the maneuvering thrusters.Unfortunately there isn't a checklist this time and all the buttons are in Chinese so she starts pushing buttons at random. Fortunately the Chinese planned for this scenario because when she pushed the wrong button she got a bad tone and when she pushed the right button she got a good tone. So why do we need checklists when all you need are toned buttons?Fortunately for her everything is automatic because the deorbit burn goes perfect, the capsule separates and orientates itself perfectly for reentry, the chutes deploy at the right altitide, and she splashes down.Unfortunately the Soyuz both Russian and Chinese were designed to land on land not splashdown in the ocean. She must've forgotten the history of the Mercury program when Gus Grissom's Liberty Bell 7 hatch was blown prematurely when he splashed down and quickly sank in the Atlantic Ocean and he almost drowned. Unless she was short on air she should've stayed put instead of blowing the hatch. Fortunately she splashed down in a very shallow sea or lake because she was able to strip down to her astro undies after her capsule quickly sank and took her with it but she couldn't get to the surface because of her heavy suite so the striptease was warranted in this occasion.So after rising to the surface she makes a quick swim to shore and crawls out of the water. I guess she was crawling due to an extended time in space thereby her muscles were atrophied or she could've been tired. She did however look pretty good in those wet astro undies.This was the movie in 3D and it will be the last 3D movie I pay to see because it did nothing for the movie, the same thing happened last year with Prometheus, it looked much better and sharper in 2D.The movie pretty much happens in real screentime so you have to take that into consideration. My review is the whole movie in a nutshell without getting into every scene or what little dialog, meaningful or meaningless, there was.This movie did have a somewhat happy ending but in reality it would have been a total loss of all hands but the writers and producers took the deus ex machina approach to this movie from the beginning.I can't believe all the 4 and 5 star reviews for this movie unless it's mostly the people from the studio making those reviews especially those that appear cookie cutter.My 3-star review is for an okay or average if you don't think too much. Had I stuck to my guns when first hearing about this movie, I would've waited for it to come out on video and maybe buy used. Instead I saw an interview with a couple real astronauts on TV last week and they sold me on it.",3,"This is not Apollo 13, 2001, etc",1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,6147,"['went', 'Imax', 'theater',

1685424,A1UU8JCSRAMNSW,B00H83EUL2,JohnG,"[0, 0]","Just talking with other people who have seen ""Gravity"", it seems either people loved it or hated it.Personally,  I found ""Gravity"" to be a stunning visual experience accompanied by Sandra Bullock's fine performace.Having seen the movie in 3D IMAX at the theatre,  and again in 2D on my 55"" TV, I would definitely recommend seeing this in 3D. The 2D version is not bad, however, the 3D format is what makes this a visually stunning experience.Given the hype surrounding this movie, and seeing the 2D version, one can understand why some people feel the movie wasn't as good as expected.  (It's almost like having popcorn without the butter).Nonetheless,  in 3D, the opening scenes make the viewer feel like they are right there with Sandra and George Clooney. Countless other scenes provide similar viewing experiences and a ""wow"" factor.  Overall, the 3D is really top notch.As for the acting,  Sandra provides a great performance and George is typical George in his limited role.Although there are a few slow moments in the film, these moments are used to build the characters and are like a ""calm before the storm"". If slow moments in a sci-fi movie turn you off, then use them for an opportunity to refill your popcorn bowl - 'cause when you return, you'll once again find yourself glued to the screen as the impending debris field makes its orbit back to Sandra. If you don't mind a little jibber-jabber between George and Sandra, these moments will pass by painlessly.Overall,  there is still plenty of suspense and action to be had. And, whether seen in 2D or 3D, this is still a must-see film for fans of sci-fi/ space genre type movies.",5,Love it or hate it? ...,1393891200,"03 4, 2014",2014,1644,"['Just', 'talking', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'Gravity', 'people', 'loved', 'hated', 'it.Personally', 'found', 'Gravity', 'be', 'stunning', 'visual', 'experience', 'accompanied', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'fine', 'performace.Having', 'seen', 'movie', '3D', 'IMAX', 'theatre', 'again', '2D', '55', 'TV', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'seeing', '3D', '2D', 'version', 'not', 'bad', 'however', '3D', 'format', 'what', 'visually', 'stunning', 'experience.Given', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'movie', 'seeing', '2D', 'version', 'one', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'feel', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'expected', 'almost', 'having', 'popcorn', 'butter', '.Nonetheless', '3D', 'opening', 'scenes', 'make', 'viewer', 'feel', 'are', 'right', 'there', 'Sandra', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Countless', 'other', 'scenes', 'similar', 'viewing', 'experiences', 'wow', 'factor', 'Overall', '3D', 'really', 'top', 'notch.As', 'acting', 'Sandra', 'great', 'performance', 'George', 'typical', 'George', 'limited', 'role.Although', 'are', 'few', 'slow', 'moments', 'film', 'moments', 'are', 'used', 'build', 'characters', 'are', 'calm', 'storm', 'slow', 'moments', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'turn', 'off', 'then', 'use', 'opportunity', 'refill', 'popcorn', 'bowl', ""'cause"", 'when', 'return', ""'ll"", 'once', 'again', 'find', 'glued', 'screen', 'impending', 'debris', 'field', 'orbit', 'back', 'Sandra', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'little', 'jibber-jabber', 'George', 'Sandra', 'moments', 'will', 'pass', 'painlessly.Overall', 'still', 'plenty', 'suspense', 'action', 'be', 'had', 'seen', '2D', '3D', 'still', 'must-see', 'film', 'fans', 'sci-fi/', 'space', 'genre', 'type', 'movies']",N/A
1685425,AXOO7BPM22BDO,B00H83EUL2,"John Green ""Darkwriter""","[22, 36]","In space, no one can hear you scream... or your last gasp.On the final space shuttle mission headed by astronaut Matt Kowalski (Clooney), Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) is brought along to install a new type of software she designed.  Disaster strikes when the team is endangered by debris from an 'accidentally destroyed' Russian satellite.  The wreckage also damages other satellites in its path, disrupting communications.  Stone becomes separated from the now-destroyed shuttle, and the race is on both to find her and get to the safety of a nearby space station before the next orbit brings the fast-moving debris back around again.The cinematography is, without question, amazingly beautiful.  Photos of deep space always illicit a thrill in us earthbound mortals, and this one's no different.  Some of the visuals and creative imagery, such as reflections on the astronauts' visors and the views of Earth from low orbit and Bullock spinning uncontrollably in space, will absolutely grab you.  There's also sub-text of being born again- with Bullock being framed in some shots as if she's in utero, complete with a loose cable symbolizing an umbilical cord, and her new life when she finally returns to earth, readjusting to gravity.This is a brilliant concept, and it only takes two (three if you count Ed Harris' voice only performance as Mission Control) to pull it off.  Clooney as Kowalski is a great supporting character- a consummate professional, cool under pressure, knowledgeable of the situation and a storehouse of personal anecdotes which he'll happily regale you with.  Bullock's Stone is the complete opposite- quiet, withdrawn and nervous.  We get to see the wonders and terrors of space from her perspective, and it mostly works.The problem is two-fold: one is Bullock's character.  She's intelligent and moderately resourceful, but also extremely high-strung and prone to panic attacks- exactly the kind of person that would not be sent into space.  After enduring the third instance of her going OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG in ten minutes, I wanted her to die already so we could get back to Clooney.Second: because of her character's flaws, the script has to be dumbed down to accommodate them.  Kowalski rescues her and hauls her back to the space station via tether, but somehow keeps her TALKING, so she's continually using the oxygen she's running low on!  No reason for this other than to set up the no-more-oxygen-get-inside-quick-before-you-die scene, since he could've simply kept up the chatter himself and let her relax... and save her air. Upon reaching the International Space Station, their inertia makes them collide with it; Stone gets her foot tangled in wires, barely hanging on but manages to snag Kowalski's tether before he spins away, his momentum pulling them away from the ISS.  Here all Kowalski had to do was pull himself forward and let his new inertia carry him back towards the ISS, saving them both, but again...  Once she's returned to relative safety aboard the ISS, she completely misses a small fire starting in an alcove- that she literally went right past and couldn't have missed, except the script called for her to- so our next crisis is ready to go.Gravity is one of those movies that was a great idea, and delivers for the most part but falls short in key areas for trying to stretch out the tension.  Not that it's a bad idea, but they just did it in the wrong ways.",3,Freefall,1380844800,"10 4, 2013",2013,3418,"['space', 'one', 'can', 'hear', 'scream', 'last', 'gasp.On', 'final', 'space', 'shuttle', 'mission', 'headed', 'astronaut', 'Matt', 'Kowalski', 'Clooney', 'Dr.', 'Ryan', 'Stone', 'Bullock', 'brought', 'install', 'new', 'type', 'software', 'designed', 'Disaster', 'strikes', 'when', 'team', 'endangered', 'debris', ""'accidentally"", 'destroyed', 'Russian', 'satellite', 'wreckage', 'also', 'damages', 'other', 'satellites', 'path', 'disrupting', 'communications', 'Stone', 'becomes', 'separated', 'now-destroyed', 'shuttle', 'race', 'find', 'get', 'safety', 'nearby', 'space', 'station', 'next', 'orbit', 'fast-moving', 'debris', 'back', 'again.The', 'cinematography', 'question', 'amazingly', 'beautiful', 'Photos', 'deep', 'space', 'always', 'illicit', 'thrill', 'earthbound', 'mortals', 'one', 'different', 'visuals', 'creative', 'imagery', 'such', 'reflections', 'astronauts', 'visors', 'views', 'Earth', 'low', 'orbit', 'Bullock', 'spinning', 'uncontrollably', 'space', 'will', 'absolutely', 'grab', 'also', 'sub-text', 'being', 'born', 'again-', 'Bullock', 'being', 'framed', 'shots', 'utero', 'complete', 'loose', 'cable', 'symbolizing', 'umbilical', 'cord', 'new', 'life', 'when', 'finally', 'earth', 'readjusting', 'gravity.This', 'brilliant', 'concept', 'only', 'two', 'three', 'count', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'voice', 'only', 'performance', 'Mission', 'Control', 'pull', 'off', 'Clooney', 'Kowalski', 'great', 'supporting', 'character-', 'consummate', 'professional', 'cool', 'pressure', 'knowledgeable', 'situation', 'storehouse', 'personal', 'anecdotes', ""'ll"", 'happily', 'regale', 'Bullock', 'Stone', 'complete', 'opposite-', 'quiet', 'withdrawn', 'nervous', 'get', 'see', 'wonders', 'terrors', 'space', 'perspective', 'mostly', 'problem', 'two-fold', 'one', 'Bullock', 'character', 'intelligent', 'moderately', 'resourceful', 'also', 'extremely', 'high-strung', 'prone', 'panic', 'attacks-', 'exactly', 'kind', 'person', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'sent', 'space', 'enduring', 'third', 'instance', 'going', 'OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG', 'ten', 'minutes', 'wanted', 'die', 'already', 'could', 'get', 'back', 'Clooney.Second', 'character', 'flaws', 'script', 'be', 'dumbed', 'accommodate', 'Kowalski', 'hauls', 'back', 'space', 'station', 'tether', 'somehow', 'TALKING', 'continually', 'using', 'oxygen', 'running', 'low', 'reason', 'other', 'set', 'up', 'no-more-oxygen-get-inside-quick-before-you-die', 'scene', 'could', ""'ve"", 'simply', 'kept', 'up', 'chatter', 'let', 'relax', 'save', 'air', 'reaching', 'International', 'Space', 'Station', 'inertia', 'collide', 'Stone', 'foot', 'tangled', 'wires', 'barely', 'hanging', 'manages', 'snag', 'Kowalski', 'tether', 'away', 'momentum', 'pulling', 'away', 'ISS', 'Here', 'Kowalski', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'pull', 'forward', 'let', 'new', 'inertia', 'carry', 'back', 'ISS', 'saving', 'again', 'returned', 'relative', 'safety', 'ISS', 'completely', 'small', 'fire', 'starting', 'alcove-', 'literally', 'went', 'right', 'past', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'missed', 'script', 'called', 'to-', 'next', 'crisis', 'ready', 'go.Gravity', 'one', 'movies', 'was', 'great', 'idea', 'delivers', 'most', 'part', 'short', 'key', 'areas', 'trying', 'stretch', 'out', 'tension', 'Not', 'bad', 'idea', 'just', 'did', 'wrong', 'ways']",N/A

If you want to get a sense of the experience of this film, think about stories in which someone is alone on a boat on a vast ocean and has to live by their wits. The isolation pervades the movie, and the lack of an intrusive score intensifies the feeling of what it would be like to be alone in near space. The photography is absolutely spectacular, and the 3-D effects are much more sophisticated than my memories of early 3-D. The 3-D is used to bring the isolation of the space station into contrast with the experience of the vastness of space. The plot line is sparse and the focus is on a very capable Sandra Bullock as a lone astronaut struggling to survive.

1685440,AU3GYRAKBUAEU,B00H83EUL2,Jon Norris,"[5, 8]","I was really looking forward to seeing this film. I have been waiting for months for Amazon to have it for rent (I stopped going to theaters decades ago - I prefer DVDs and my big screen at home). The premise is full of incredible opportunities for fantastic story-telling, and with actors the caliber of Bullock and Clooney, I was hoping for something really, really great.Unfortunately, as usually happens with ""Hollyweird"" these days, I was very, very disappointed. It falls so far short of the possibilities, that it is almost not worth mentioning them.First of all, for those who are calling this ""science fiction,"" it is not. It is an action/adventure film with a tiny bit of drama spread on top. Neither is it science fact, although the film isn't moving enough to make me research the accuracy of the effects or story details.George Clooney has joined the ranks of Sean Connery, Michael Caine, and Cary Grant in being one of those actors who can raise the level of a movie simply by being there. Sandra Bullock has also proven she has the acting chops for any role they throw at her. To spend 90 minutes banging these actors around in space suits instead of having them investigate the intense emotional and existential questions this situation brings up is a huge waste of talent.There are many things I could criticize about the writing, but that would make for too many spoilers. I will simply say that it is written, like most Hollywood films, for 8-10 year olds who like action and adrenalin rushes. There is little or no depth to the characters, no opportunities for deep, soul searching conversations as they face death, etc. The writing is plain, drab, and lifeless.There are, however, several opportunities to see Bullock in very skimpy, underwear-like clothes, also very Hollywood-predictable for attracting young males. (Not that I mind that part very much, being male. Bullock has a very nice body and I certainly enjoyed looking. One such instance even offers an homage to an icon of science fiction movies, in a remarkably strange moment).Why Hollywood seems to need to have women disrobe in all sorts of critical and dire circumstances is an interesting window on the emotional maturity of the Hollywood elite. Interesting also that women audience members were not given the same opportunity to enjoy Clooney in similar garb, which I know large numbers of women would certainly enjoy. I guess they only wanted to overstimulate young males. (Okay, and not so young ones, too.)The cinematography and special effects were indeed very good, and the movie is worth seeing for that alone. Just don't go into this film thinking that you will see or hear anything deeply moving or insightful. If you approach it as a shallow action film, you won't be disappointed.It is, however, very useful in pointing out how very primitive and fragile our current public space programs are - about like people paddling kayaks across the Pacific ocean - very little concern for the survival and/or rescue of the brave people we send on these missions. I think we could do far better by them.We can certainly do better movies than this.UPDATE: I was tickled to see that the Honest Trailers folks agreed with my impressions of this film.

I have heard it was good.Before the review, a few things.  If you are one who has motion sickness.  I would not see this movie.  I never get bothered by stuff moving around a lot.  But many times, while watching this movie, I started breathing really fast and my heart started beating faster.  It gets intense.  If you are one who needs a lot of stuff happening, this may not be for you.  Do not get me wrong, there are things happening.  But it is all set within a single area.  The camera never gets to far from the characters.  It does when they are in space, but when they are in the ship, it is very close to them.There are movies in which a killer is in the woods and you must escape through all the hazards in order to find safety.  There are movies in which you are in a ship and must find land before massive storms destroy you.  There are movies in which one is abused and must find the courage within themselves to find safety.  All of those situations are dangerous and if you do not give your all, you will not survive.  Now, if you will, imagine you are in a place in which there is no air, no land, no possible way to survive unless EVERYTHING works to the exact degree that it was intended.  Welcome, to Gravity.This is really a psychological movie.  It is about a person or people who with no contact, hardly any movement and all the odds against them having to find a way to live.  Sometimes they will realize that they have to do things differently, in order to live.  They may give up, only to have something happen that makes them realize they should and can survive, by using that which they have learned.  There are times in the movie in which the people will be outside the shuttle.  Due to something happening, debris is coming towards the ship.  When you see it, you will get very tense.  Then they are climbing on the stuff, trying to get to a location, you will feel tense.  It is very nerve racking.  There are no more than four people in this movie.  I do not want to give anything away.  But I just wanted to let people know that this is not a movie with a lot of back and forth.  It is almost like I am Legend.  There are things that bothered me in this movie.  Things that happened that really did not make much sense.  The very end is a bit odd as well.  After everything that happened, it just did not seem like a big enough ending.  But, I will buy this movie.  I can only imagine how intense this will be if I watch it at home.

The movie consists of only two actors and set entirely in space.  This simplicity behind it helps intensify the spiritual emphasis by eliminating  distractions usually found in most movies.  There are no meaningless gun fights, perverse killings, and aliens monsters set out  to destroy the human race.  Instead the setting consists of two astronauts floating in the calmness of space attempting to repair a satellite while a visually stunning large earth looms silently below.  The calmness violently comes to an end  when an accident sends debris racing toward the astronauts and their space shuttle at over 50,000 mile per hour.  I don't want to give too much away, but the movie has one thrilling  emotionally charged action scene after another.The main underlying plot consists of one character Ryan Stone (played by Sandra Bullock) that goes through spiritual awakening through times of intense suffering and pain.  As the movie progresses you find out in small pieces that Ryan is a emotionally tormented soul from her recent experiences on Earth, which could represent the human race in general.  The cold empty space the movie takes place in could also symbolize  the emptiness that exists without the incredible creation of life we all take for granted.At one point Ryan decides to give up and peacefully accept her fate and eventual death.  Something most of us have experienced at one time or another in our lives.  I personally found this scene to be intensely peaceful.  This scene expressed how life at times can be intense emotional or physical suffering and death as a peaceful end to it.  At the brink of death and desperation, Ryan has a vision or spiritual awakening (also comparable to what Natives experience while hallucinating on Peyote) and decides not to give up on life and make her way back to Earth.Spoiler alert:When Ryan makes it back to Earth, her space pod crashes into the ocean.  She barely escapes to the surface after removing her heavy space suit and most of her clothing.  You could say this could represent baptism or washing away of her past and being reborn again.  She swims to the beach with a new intense gratitude for life.  This  scene is very powerful and gives the audience a new appreciation for this incredible beautiful planet that gives us all the scared gift of life.  This movie is very powerful in a spiritual and inspirational way.

The difference being is that Gravity was done in the way that I wished &#34;All is Lost&#34; would have been done.Gravity pulls no punches and quickly gives you everything right away by jumping into the action quickly.  The special effects are spectacular and the story kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time injecting both hope and despair throughout.  And unlike the Redford movie, gives me some character background that is enough to make me care about the character and also Bullock does a great job at detailing her actions throughout without being too much so.  Unlike All is Lost which chooses to use very little conversation or self interaction to tell the story (which I thought was its failing).Although I am not a huge Bullock fan, she plays the role very well by displaying all aspects of the character in a way that is believable emotionally.Although I watched at home instead of  IMAX 3D, my wife did and said that they were amazing on the big screen.  If the effects were that good on my TV, I could only imagine what they were like on the big screen.Granted I will agree with some of the critics concerning the likeliness of the story happening and that doesn't bother me so much as I can suspend reality enough to enjoy the movie for what it is, which is a good science fiction thriller and worthy of 4 stars.",4,Kept me on the edge of my seat,1395792000,"03 26, 2014",2014,1773,"['Gravity', 'story', 'medical', 'engineer', 'Bullock', 'astronaut', 'Clooney', 'who', 'must', 'work', 'together', 'survive', 'catastrophe', 'shuttle', 'adrift', 'orbit.One', 'first', 'thoughts', 'seeing', 'movie', 'concept', 'lost', 'middle', 'sea', 'versus', 'lost', 'middle', 'space', 'orbit', 'bit', 'recently', 'released', 'Redford', 'movie', '34', 'Lost', '34', 'was', 'disappointed', 'difference', 'being', 'Gravity', 'was', 'done', 'way', 'wished', '34', 'Lost', '34', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'done.Gravity', 'punches', 'quickly', 'everything', 'right', 'away', 'jumping', 'action', 'quickly', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'spectacular', 'story', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'whole', 'time', 'injecting', 'hope', 'despair', 'Redford', 'movie', 'character', 'background', 'enough', 'make', 'care', 'character', 'also', 'Bullock', 'great', 'job', 'detailing', 'actions', 'being', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'Lost', 'use', 'very', 'little', 'conversation', 'self', 'interaction', 'tell', 'story', 'thought', 'was', 'failing', 'am', 'not', 'huge', 'Bullock', 'fan', 'role', 'very', 'well', 'displaying', 'aspects', 'character', 'way', 'believable', 'watched', 'home', 'instead', 'IMAX', '3D', 'wife', 'did', 'said', 'were', 'amazing', 'big', 'screen', 'effects', 'were', 'good', 'TV', 'could', 'only', 'imagine', 'what', 'were', 'big', 'screen.Granted', 'will', 'agree', 'critics', 'concerning', 'likeliness', 'story', 'happening', ""n't"", 'bother', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'suspend', 'reality', 'enough', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'what', 'good', 'science', 'fiction', 'thriller', 'worthy', '4', 'stars']",N/A

Those special effects are there for one reason and one reason only, to serve and highlight the acting.I could give you a point by point synopsis of the film, but that might make the movie seem pedestrian to someone who hasn't seen it. So here's the general plot: during a space walk on a shuttle, three astronauts are working on fixing the Hubble telescope when its reported a nearby satellite has exploded, first reports indicate there's no danger, but soon enough the shuttle and crew is being bombarded by exploding satellite parts at 25,000 miles per hour, only astronauts Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) survive and they're separated from the shuttle survival is the rest of the movie. It's Bullock's film as she moves from a scared mission specialist to someone that runs the gamut of emotions as she struggles to survive in an environment not suited to survival.Director Alfonso Cuaron could have easily been overwhelmed by the computer generated effects or let them be the star. While he does give you sweeping panoramic shots of the astronauts floating in space with the earth serenely revolving beneath them, that is only to give the viewer a sense of what it's like to be in space. Quick flashes of Clooney's and Bullock's characters show how quickly the peacefulness can be swept away by the realities of space.A note, while it's true that in space no one can hear you scream it also seems true that if you're a woman in space under your suit you need to be in form fitting panties and a skimpy t-shirt, true for Sigourney Weaver in `Alien' and true for Bullock in `Gravity.'",5,Gravity heavy on Acting and Special Effects Mixes Well,1382227200,"10 20, 2013",2013,1779,"['Gravity', 'sort', 'movie', 'would', 'usually', 'be', 'railing', 'over', 'usage', 'computer', 'generated', 'special', 'effects', 'Gravity', 'exception', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'there', 'one', 'reason', 'one', 'reason', 'only', 'serve', 'highlight', 'acting.I', 'could', 'give', 'point', 'point', 'synopsis', 'film', 'might', 'make', 'movie', 'seem', 'pedestrian', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'So', 'here', 'general', 'plot', 'space', 'walk', 'shuttle', 'three', 'astronauts', 'are', 'working', 'fixing', 'Hubble', 'telescope', 'when', 'reported', 'nearby', 'satellite', 'exploded', 'first', 'reports', 'indicate', 'danger', 'soon', 'enough', 'shuttle', 'crew', 'being', 'bombarded', 'exploding', 'satellite', 'parts', '25,000', 'miles', 'hour', 'only', 'Matt', 'Kowalski', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Ryan', 'Stone', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'survive', ""'re"", 'separated', 'shuttle', 'survival', 'rest', 'movie', 'Bullock', 'film', 'scared', 'mission', 'specialist', 'someone', 'gamut', 'emotions', 'survive', 'environment', 'not', 'suited', 'survival.Director', 'Alfonso', 'Cuaron', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'overwhelmed', 'computer', 'generated', 'effects', 'let', 'be', 'star', 'give', 'sweeping', 'panoramic', 'shots', 'astronauts', 'floating', 'space', 'earth', 'serenely', 'revolving', 'only', 'give', 'viewer', 'sense', 'what', 'be', 'space', 'Quick', 'flashes', 'Clooney', 'Bullock', 'characters', 'show', 'how', 'quickly', 'peacefulness', 'can', 'be', 'swept', 'away', 'realities', 'space.A', 'note', 'true', 'space', 'one', 'can', 'hear', 'scream', 'also', 'true', ""'re"", 'woman', 'space', 'suit', 'need', 'be', 'form', 'fitting', 'panties', 'skimpy', 't-shirt', 'true', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Alien', 'true', 'Bullock', 'Gravity']",N/A

Weaver ""karlweaver""","[0, 0]","Now that this is out on DVD, Blu-Ray, 3-D or whatever your preferred poison and the Academy Awards are over, you've probably heard quite a bit about &#34;Gravity&#34; already.  I hope I can add something interesting.Is this scientifically accurate?  No, there are several areas in which it takes liberties for dramatic purpose.  For example: space debris traveling at 20,000 or 22,000 mph passes by on the screen looking like it's going about 200-250 mph.  In reality, unless you saw it on radar you would never see debris coming that fast before it hit you or hit something nearby.  Could the destruction of one satellite trigger such a rapid cascade of debris taking out most orbiting satellites (as well as space stations, shuttles etc?)  No, they wouldn't fall like a stack of dominoes in rapid succession.  However this relates to one of the strengths of the film: its grounding in real concerns.The DVD or Blu-Ray has a lot of &#34;special features&#34;, the best of which I felt was a documentary about the real problem of space debris.  I didn't realize this actually has its own name now (from the NASA scientist who first raised alarm flags).  As the documentary points out, our modern world increasingly relies upon satellites: for phone transmissions, GPS, TV, and all kinds of things.  And there's a huge amount of JUNK out there now.  I remember hearing about the Chinese &#34;shooting down&#34; one of their own ageing weather satellites to test the technology, which produced a huge amount of orbiting debris.  I did NOT remember ever hearing that an Iridium satellite collided with an out-of-service Russian military satellite producing an even larger amount of orbiting debris.  I remember one US shuttle coming back with a big ole chip out of the front windshield, thought most likely the result of collision with a really small object like a fleck of paint, at the huge velocities involved if orbiting things collide head-on.  I did NOT hear that the International Space Station has many such damage marks already.  I thought if we just took care not to increase the amount of junk up there, it would gradually decrease, as orbits tend to decay and stuff eventually falls back to earth.  On the contrary there is a real concern that further collisions between large objects in orbit will produce large increases in orbiting debris, increasing the odds of more collisions, causing even more debris, until we reach the point that most existing satellites would be in peril, as would future launches.  Once we reached that point, we could in fact lose many useful satellites and the services they provide, and be unable to safely replace them and be assured that their replacements would last a long time.  That's the realistic background for the story.And this story is very well-done.  Visually it's fantastic (not just on IMAX and not just in 3-D, but on a home system too).  Dramatically, it's hard to ask for much better.  A lot of thought went into every scene, every word of dialog.  This is a movie worth watching.  The PG-13 rating also seems appropriate; there are scenes of dead bodies and it could easily be too frightening for children, but there is no unnecessary blood, gore, swearing or nudity.The biggest complaint I could offer is: not only a lot of thought went into everything, on the &#34;bonus features&#34; they had to TELL you their every thought too.  A movie of 91 minutes ought not to have a special feature of 1 hr 45 minutes of talking about how they did it.  Sorry, I think that goes on a &#34;commentary soundtrack&#34; which should be cut down to 91 minutes.  But in addition to the nice science documentary, there's also a nice short film made by the director, very much related to the main feature, which I enjoyed watching.

AND, what's not to like a George Clooney????  Not a thing in my book.  LOLThis film is almost non-stop action and a lot of it heart pounding at that--at least for me.  I found the initial premise of the movie quite plausible given the vast plethora of &#34;stuff&#34; (George Carlin would like that!) that is orbiting our beautiful planet.  Other parts of the storyline might have been conveniently stretched to make it work but to me if felt like a super smart, intelligent, courageous woman used all her faculties to overcome the many, HUGE obstacles that she faced to survive.  I really LIKE movies with strong female leads, e.g. Sigourney Weaver in Alien and Aliens.  Sandra Bullock as Dr. Ryan Stone in this film did not disappoint.Aside from the storyline, I marveled at just &#34;how did they do that?&#34;  I had read a review that explained in the briefest of descriptions but I still couldn't fathom how it was done.  Well, the good news is that this purchase has two DVDs and the second one shows all that was done to make this film work.  The second DVD was as interesting as the movie itself.  Every single part of the movie making process was profiled and every one of them was fascinating.  I was SO impressed with the courage, determination, time and talent that went into the making of this film.  The innovation of the production team was amazing.  They broke new ground on so many levels.  They have raised the bar and set a new benchmark for future such films.  The second DVD made me like the movie even more and I've watched the &#34;making it&#34; DVD twice--it was that interesting and good.Finally, some information that I wish all movie sellers would put in their descriptions:-  It is rated PG-13-  It is widescreen &#34;letterbox&#34; format so you won't miss anything.  You will see it just as it was presented in the theater.  May I also add here, that this film is best viewed in 3-D but that said, I found nothing lacking watching it at home on my HDTV without 3D.-  It is a Digital Ultraviolet movie that you could download from the &#34;cloud&#34; which means you can watch it on a variety of devices--a very nice feature, indeed.YOU WILL LOVE IT!KLM",5,OMG,1396310400,"04 1, 2014",2014,2296,"['What', 'stellar', 'movie', 'First', 'am', 'fan', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'film', 'what', 'not', 'like', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Not', 'thing', 'book', 'LOLThis', 'film', 'almost', 'non-stop', 'action', 'lot', 'heart', 'pounding', 'least', 'found', 'initial', 'premise', 'movie', 'quite', 'plausible', 'given', 'vast', 'plethora', '34', 'stuff', '34', 'George', 'Carlin', 'would', 'like', 'orbiting', 'beautiful', 'planet', 'Other', 'parts', 'storyline', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'conveniently', 'stretched', 'make', 'work', 'felt', 'super', 'smart', 'intelligent', 'courageous', 'woman', 'used', 'faculties', 'overcome', 'many', 'HUGE', 'faced', 'survive', 'really', 'LIKE', 'movies', 'strong', 'female', 'leads', 'e.g', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Alien', 'Aliens', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Dr.', 'Ryan', 'Stone', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint.Aside', 'storyline', 'marveled', 'just', '34', 'how', 'did', 'do', '34', 'had', 'read', 'review', 'explained', 'briefest', 'descriptions', 'still', 'could', ""n't"", 'fathom', 'how', 'was', 'done', 'Well', 'good', 'news', 'purchase', 'two', 'DVDs', 'second', 'one', 'was', 'done', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'second', 'DVD', 'was', 'as', 'interesting', 'movie', 'single', 'part', 'movie', 'making', 'process', 'was', 'profiled', 'one', 'was', 'fascinating', 'was', 'SO', 'impressed', 'courage', 'determination', 'time', 'talent', 'went', 'making', 'film', 'innovation', 'production', 'team', 'was', 'amazing', 'broke', 'new', 'ground', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'have', 'raised', 'bar', 'set', 'new', 'benchmark', 'future', 'such', 'films', 'second', 'DVD', 'made', 'movie', 'even', 'more', ""'ve"", 'watched', '34', 'making', '34', 'DVD', 'twice', 'was', 'interesting', 'good.Finally', 'information', 'wish', 'movie', 'sellers', 'would', 'put', 'descriptions', 'rated', 'PG-13-', 'widescreen', '34', 'letterbox', '34', 'format', 'wo', ""n't"", 'miss', 'anything', 'will', 'see', 'just', 'was', 'presented', 'theater', 'May', 'also', 'add', 'here', 'film', 'best', 'viewed', '3-D', 'said', 'found', 'nothing', 'lacking', 'watching', 'home', 'HDTV', '3D.-', 'Digital', 'Ultraviolet', 'movie', 'could', 'download', '34', 'cloud', '34', 'can', 'watch', 'variety', 'devices', 'very', 'nice', 'feature', 'indeed.YOU', 'WILL', 'LOVE', 'IT', 'KLM']",N/A

The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalski completely alone--tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth...and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.The cast led by Sandra Bullock (as Dr. Ryan Stone) & George Clooney (as Matt Kowalski) is brilliant.

A better script would have helped to get viewers involved, but maybe the Oscars will sway people into losing common sense in terms of accurately criticizing this film. I happen to like films that are set in space (well, mostly ones that don't include aliens, but also don't mire us into outright boredom--as in the case of &#34;Apollo 13&#34;--talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk), and &#34;Gravity&#34;, for all of its 'turn the camera on and see what happens' approach, is pretty interesting visually, but so thin in plot and understanding of humanity that I wonder why everyone made the fuss that they did about such a simple premise. Maybe I needed to see it in 3D, but I doubt that I would change my opinion even so!The DVD looks great and sounds great, and mine plays like a charm.

The appearance of a space shuttle is the first surprise, since the real shuttle program is scrapped, so one would expect to see American astronauts hitchhiking aboard a Soyuz. Regardless, for reasons not explained, and lacking expertise, Bullock crews a mysterious shuttle mission that involves screwing and unscrewing a metal plate. Typical of her mishaps throughout the film, she screws that up and needs help to stop bolts from tumbling away and becoming space junk. Suddenly, something goes wrong, people get killed, debris hurtles in every direction, Bullock panics and essentially spends the rest of the movie in a stupor, surviving only with cajoling from beyond the grave. The pacing is terrible: many times, the refrain at our gathering was &#34;GET ON WITH IT.&#34;  Credibility is stretched: all space stations are within visual range, you reach them by pointing in a straight line, satellite orbits intersect like bullets in a crossfire. Adding to the wild west atmosphere, Bullock spends crucial moments chatting on ham radio with an inebriated Eskimo. We never learn the nature of the mysterious force that pulls Clooney away from Bullock selectively, and we never learn how Bullock operates Chinese instrument panels with razor precision, but maybe all instrument panels are the same, and maybe the universe wanted revenge on Clooney for those old Batman nipples.  Anyway, Bullock gets an opportunity to display her assets and acting talent, and that's really all that matters, right?

1685586,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B00H83EUL2,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[3, 5]","Director Alfonso Cuaron (Children of Men, Harry Potter and the Prisoner Of Azkaban) took and amazingly simple premise of a fictional STS (Space Transport System) mission using the now retired Space Shuttle fleet and bringing the `reality' of walking in space to complete and full visceral life on the big screen. ""Gravity"" is one of those films where you'll leave the theatre feeling like you had just experienced an amazing adventure yourself.Written by Cuaron and his son Jonas Cuaron (Year of the Nail), this is a fresh original story that will move you with every frame of film. This is one of those rare films where the experience is only enhanced if you see it both in 3D and in IMAX. It was a thrilling adventure. It was breathtaking. It was scary. It was awe-inspiring and it was a roller-coaster of action and event after event.Sandra Bullock (The Proposal, The Blind Side) plays Mission Specialist and medical engineer Ryan Stone who definitively gives an Academy Award deserving performance throughout this production. She plays a nervous, somewhat excited and an extremely professional scientist sent up in orbit to enhance the Hubble telescope.The Mission Commander, Matt Kowalsky, who is on his last mission before retiring to Earth, is wonderfully played by George Clooney (Batman & Robin, The Descendants). He is light hearted, professional and focused but knows how to make his team feel good about their work and being in space.Things go terrible wrong as a Russian Anti-Satellite test goes wrong and they have to destroy it in space. Shooting and destroying it with missiles from Earth. The debris from the explosion (which we never actually see the explosion) is blasted into orbit traveling in thousands of pieces at the speed of a bullet.  (Which is approximately 900 to over 1000 miles per hour.) At those speeds, with no atmosphere, no resistance and no sound, within half-a-second they rip through, the shuttle, the probes, the satellites are literally pelted to pieces and yes, even some of the crew.Because this happens in space, it's Clooneys, character that figures out that they stay in orbit around Earth at that speed and appear every 90 minutes or so and again rip through anything in their path until their individual orbits decay. The film is basically about survival in what is literally the loneliest place you could ever be. Space. No sound. The finale is amazing and the depths that Bullock's character goes through and the performance she gives will leave you inspired.With just the two of the most incredible actors Hollywood has to offer(Bullock and Clooney), along with director Cuaron, they take you a thrilling (and peaceful) journey through space, space stations and even satellites that orbit above us as you read this even now. With beautiful cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki (Children of Men, Sleepy Hollow) and incredibly accurate production design by Andy Nicholson (The Mummy, Alice In Wonderland) ""Gravity"" is a full blown `real' movie experience.The panoramas of the Earth and space are amazing. The stars shimmering against Earth are beautiful and quiet and incredibly detailed. (Especially in the IMAX and 3D format.) The music by Steven Price (The World's End) is just as inspiring as the images you see. This is one of the best Science Fiction films I've seen in a long while and it feels so visceral and life-like that you actually feel good leaving the theatre.

They play a medical engineer and an astronaut who struggle to survive an accident that leaves them stranded in space. Both are doing a space walk when an emergency situation involving Russia &#34;accidentally&#34; shutting down one of its own satellites occurs and they must dodge debris and return to their ship to survive. The performance of Clooney is solid as usual but Bullock is forgettable. It is hard for Bullock's charm to shine through in her spacesuit. While the visuals are impressive there isn't much in the way of dialogue or story. Although it is billed as a thriller this is more of a drama and remains predictable, hollow and slightly dull. If you are most interested in the special effects then you may appreciate this movie.IMDB rated this an astounding 8.8 upon initial release which is the same as The Empire Strikes Back. Don't believe the hype because it isn't even in the Top 10 for space odysseys. My date said she felt dizzy after 20 minutes but didn't mind because she loved the film (to each their own).

1685602,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B00H83EUL2,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","This is an AMAZING film, which I enjoyed greatly! This review includes very LIMITED SPOILERS.At 90 minutes this space drama is a rather short film - but it packs much more tension, drama, scares and adventures than many two hours and a half action films. Only two actors really appear in it - three other people show themselves extremely briefly and elusively and there are also some voices on the radio and that is all. But those two actors are in fact exactly as much as this film needs and limiting the numbers was an excellent idea!Almost all action takes place in space and a great effort was made to give this film a feeling of reality - especially the absence of sound in space is strictly respected, with muffled noises being heard only when one of the heroes hold some metal and hits other metal with it (metal, unlike void, conducts sound, even in space). One could think that it will hurt the film - but one would be VERY WRONG! It is actually exactly the contrary!The rhytm of the film is very fast - an emergency occurs very early in the beginning and then all hell breaks loose and it continues until the incredibly dramatic, grandiose finale, with only brief pauses to catch breath. In the cinema where I saw this film, most people abandoned all attempts to munch after five minutes - me included. And I really like my popcorn...This is NOT a sci-fi movie! The technology shown in this film really exists and purely in theory such a thing could really happen. Fiction elements were added by keeping the US space shuttle in service (they are all retired now) and by giving it a fictitious name, &#34;Explorer&#34;. Real life space shuttles were named respectively &#34;Enterprise&#34; (the prototype, not capable of space flight), &#34;Columbia&#34;, &#34;Challenger&#34;, &#34;Discovery&#34;, &#34;Atlantis&#34; and &#34;Endeavour&#34; - there never was a shuttle named &#34;Explorer&#34;, but the name sounds like one a real shuttle could bear. Another fiction element is the presence of the Chinese space station &#34;Tiangong&#34;, which is already fully operational, when in real life its construction should start only in 2020. BUT, the technology seen in this film is all there and there is no aliens, there is no mysterious forces, etc. - of course it is an adventure made in Hollywood, but in its nuts and bolts this movie is very realistic.Both Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are excellent in this film. In fact I believe Ms Bullock deserves at least an Oscar nomination for this role. Clooney's character offers him a little less oportunities to shine, but he does it nevertheless!I usually do not like 3D AT ALL, but in this film it actually adds a LOT! I advise strongly to go see this film on a big screen AND IN 3D, as long as it still plays in theatres! I will probably buy the Blu-ray version as soon as it is available, because here very pixel counts, but still, on a smaller screen and without a good 3D &#34;Gravity&#34; will lose part of its firepower.Bottom line, this is an AMAZING, GREAT film which I loved in cinema and I absolutely want to re-watch it again.

It's a shame because all of the 3D films I've seen, whether for children or adults, have had gorgeous visual effects. Why can't they create a visually beautiful film that leaves you feeling good or at least thinking about the story when you leave? The animated movies don't have to exclude adults. Just make the story as interesting as the visuals. Even Avatar, which had some of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen in a film had ugly creatures and lots of fighting.

You've seen the previews, and yet I can tell you what you have seen is only a small part.  How can someone make a movie with such emotional courage, spiritual inspiration, and sheer determination out of what we have already seen?  But they do, oh they do!It was motivational for me.  What makes it so?  I suppose it's the human side of us. How we control, or not control, our anxiety to survive. When is it time to give up, and when it is not? And, while the special effects don't even seem like special effects, they are more like pure photography.  So too are the sound effects because they don't seem like effects, but the real thing.  They simply allow the movie to be real.If you've ever wanted to go to space, see this movie.  It gives you every angle, every bit of technology, and every fear coupled with the natural laws that matter must obey.  The only thing is, being human is more than a natural order of things.  Bad things do happen in space or right here on earth.  What are you made of? Could you handle it?  This is what this movie is all about.Dr. Ryan Stone played by Sandra Bullock.  She is one of two main characters in the movie. I never once got the impression that she was acting nor did I see any bad acting that spoiled the scene.  She is a doctor, not particularly a life long employee of NASA.  So, she relies on veteran Astronaut Matt Kowalsky played by George Clooney.  His acting well is very similar to his other acting in so many movies; cool, calm and collected and well played.  He gives advice to Dr. Ryan on many times. She is wired with emotions, he is not.  Both are fantastic actors. However, I would like to see a movie where, just once, George Clooney loses it!  That would be fun!Although the plot is fairly simple, taking us through it is not. What technology will fail? What can be improvised? This is probably not a movie that you would see twice.  Unless you really wanted to try and find the few tiny glitches in acting or perhaps some scenes where inertia and gravity theories don't seem quite right and you wanted a second look.  I suppose there might be a few of those.  But that would miss the true point of the movie.In the end, the real point is that you too will thank the Earth for everything she has given you!

I love stories about the underdogs beating the odds and overcoming seemingly impossible circumstances. I'm not a big sci-fi fan. I don't generally like stuff about outer space, aliens or monsters. I like a little realism in my movies, which is something that the sci-fi genre doesn't really know how to do.The beautiful thing about &#34;Gravity&#34; is that every single thing that happens in it is possible. It all could happen in real life. It's a story about how deeply powerful the human spirit is, and how the will to survive can be more powerful than anything that might stand in a person's way. &#34;Gravity&#34; is every bit as much a character study as it is a popcorn movie. How often can you say that about a movie? It's pretty damn special.&#34;Gravity&#34; follows Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), a medical engineer who is just about to finish a 42-day long space mission with NASA with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney). While they're up there, flying satellite debris destroys their spaceship, leaving the two stranded in space, the sole survivors of this mission gone horribly wrong.The film opens with an absolutely spectacular 13-minute long panoramic shot that sets the entire film in motion. It could be a flawless short film. The film ensues with many more extended shots that are done so beautifully. It's hard to believe this movie could be pulled off so seamlessly. It's the work of a masterful director, Alfonso Cuaron, who hasn't worked since 2006's Children of Men, which was an incredible film as well. However, I think &#34;Gravity&#34; will be remembered as his best work.Sandra Bullock, who I think of as mainly a comedic actress, has pulled off a couple good dramatic performances over the years. She even won the Oscar for 2009's &#34;The Blind Side&#34;. However, you've never seen her like this. Over the course of the film's brief 90 minutes, she has to play so many different emotions, that it's evident this is the work of an incredible actress. Her character goes from being scared out of her mind, to the &#34;I'm just going to give up&#34; depression, to deciding that life is worth fighting for. Her backstory is simple, but it is enough to make you connect with this character, and feel for her every step of the way.George Clooney has a smaller part, but he does a great job with what he has. It's really Bullock's movie. It's a showcase for her remarkable talent as an actress, but it's also so much more than that. There's gorgeous symbolism and underlying themes of religion, death and rebirth. It's an intellectual popcorn movie, which is something that we certainly don't see enough in American cinema.Grade: A+",5,Gravity: An intellectual popcorn movie.,1381622400,"10 13, 2013",2013,2725,"['Survivalist', 'movies', 'are', 'favorite', 'sub-genre', 'mine', 'love', 'stories', 'underdogs', 'beating', 'odds', 'overcoming', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'circumstances', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'generally', 'like', 'stuff', 'outer', 'space', 'aliens', 'monsters', 'little', 'realism', 'movies', 'something', 'sci-fi', 'genre', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'how', 'do.The', 'beautiful', 'thing', '34', 'Gravity', '34', 'single', 'thing', 'possible', 'could', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'how', 'deeply', 'powerful', 'human', 'spirit', 'how', 'will', 'survive', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'powerful', 'anything', 'might', 'stand', 'person', 'way', '34', 'Gravity', '34', 'bit', 'much', 'character', 'study', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'How', 'often', 'can', 'say', 'about', 'movie', 'pretty', 'damn', 'special.', '34', 'Gravity', '34', 'Ryan', 'Stone', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'medical', 'engineer', 'who', 'just', 'about', 'finish', '42-day', 'long', 'space', 'mission', 'NASA', 'veteran', 'astronaut', 'Matt', 'Kowalski', 'George', 'Clooney', ""'re"", 'there', 'flying', 'satellite', 'debris', 'destroys', 'spaceship', 'leaving', 'two', 'stranded', 'space', 'sole', 'survivors', 'mission', 'gone', 'horribly', 'wrong.The', 'film', 'absolutely', 'spectacular', '13-minute', 'long', 'panoramic', 'shot', 'entire', 'film', 'motion', 'could', 'be', 'flawless', 'short', 'film', 'film', 'ensues', 'many', 'more', 'extended', 'shots', 'are', 'done', 'so', 'beautifully', 'hard', 'believe', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'pulled', 'off', 'so', 'seamlessly', 'work', 'masterful', 'director', 'Alfonso', 'Cuaron', 'who', ""n't"", 'worked', '2006', 'Children', 'Men', 'was', 'incredible', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'However', 'think', '34', 'Gravity', '34', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'best', 'work.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'who', 'think', 'mainly', 'comedic', 'actress', 'pulled', 'off', 'couple', 'good', 'dramatic', 'performances', 'years', 'even', 'won', 'Oscar', '2009', '34', 'Blind', 'Side', '34', 'However', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'course', 'film', 'brief', '90', 'minutes', 'play', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'emotions', 'evident', 'work', 'incredible', 'actress', 'character', 'being', 'scared', 'mind', '34', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'give', 'up', '34', 'depression', 'deciding', 'life', 'worth', 'fighting', 'backstory', 'simple', 'enough', 'make', 'connect', 'character', 'feel', 'step', 'way.George', 'Clooney', 'smaller', 'part', 'great', 'job', 'what', 'really', 'Bullock', 'movie', 'showcase', 'remarkable', 'talent', 'actress', 'also', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'gorgeous', 'symbolism', 'underlying', 'themes', 'religion', 'death', 'rebirth', 'intellectual', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'something', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'enough', 'American', 'cinema.Grade', 'A+']",N/A
1685654,ATP9LYGM6D3RO,B00H83EUL2,"McGillicutty ""DVD Fan""","[5, 8]","I had the pleasure of seeing this film during its theatrical release in 3D and have wondered just how well it would hold up on home video. After viewing it on my computer, I can say without question that this is one of the best movie experiences I've ever had, even when reduced to a smaller screen with no 3D. I had no trouble with the streaming from Amazon and the picture was in clear HD all the way.Sandra Bullock delivers the performance of her career as an astronaut caught in a disaster with seemingly no hope of rescue. George Clooney is also quite good as the commander of the mission who along with Bullock, must leave their destroyed shuttle in order to reach the International Space Station.This film clocks in at under 90 minutes (not including credits) and it does not let you go for a minute. Even during the quiet times, there is the relentless pressure that is constantly being cranked up as Bullock and Clooney must race the clock to get back to Earth. Alfonso Cuaron co-wrote and directed this film and like many of his previous works, he manages to create a marvelous world that we inhabit with these wonderful characters. When you consider that we only see two people alive (a third astronaut is shown, but we never see his face...entirely...) for nearly 90 minutes, it is quite remarkable just how much faith is placed in the actors. Yet with two pros like Bullock and Clooney, this is really a piece of cake for them as they effortlessly carry the film. If anything, this film really shows just how few actors can pull something this like off so easily.The world of Gravity is one that is both familiar and yet non-existent. We have not flown space shuttles for a few years, yet according to the STS mission in the film it is set in roughly 2014/2015. The Chinese station that is mentioned does exist, but is not nearly as complete as depicted. So, Gravity takes place in an alternate world that we can certainly relate. This may be due to the fact that the script had been first written several years ago, but only now was Cuaron able to make it a reality.The CGI is naturally compelling and excitingly rendered, but the core of Gravity is that at its heart it is an experimental film. The opening shot lasts for over 12 minutes, unbroken and completely mesmerizing as we are introduced to these characters. We also switch points of view from being far away from the action to actually seeing what's happening through Bullock's eyes. Bullock herself wears little in terms of makeup and for the first time her true age does show through, but that is an asset and not a detriment to the actress who delivers a powerful, heartfelt and incisive performance that makes you really wonder why she was not even on the short list of actresses for this role. Plus, without giving anything away, the final sequence in the film is yet another &#34;experimental&#34; effect that is really quite profound when you understand what the director had in mind.I realize that some people will not like this movie and I can understand why with all the hype about how it cannot live up to those expectations. It didn't help that I read a critic's review comparing Bullock's performance to that of Rene Marie Falconetti in &#34;The Passion of Joan of Arc&#34; which is arguably the greatest performance ever filmed. No, Bullock is not THAT good, but it's wonderful to see the emotions cascade across her face. And even the tacked-on bit of background to Bullock's character about her daughter manages to pay off later in the film. There is hardly a false note or any sense of a wasted shot, Cuaron does the seemingly impossible by directing a film that includes everything that is needed and not one thing more.I cannot say if this is the best film of 2013 since I have not seen all the nominees. However, this film is a true game-changer in terms of just how to create an action/disaster film. I have little doubt that big-budget CGI films that are in the planning stages are taking lessons from how to create a true thrill ride from this movie. To me, Gravity is more than just a great thrill ride however, I actually felt like I had never seen a film before while I was gripping the arms of my chair, a very rare feeling indeed.",5,Gravity is One for the Ages,1392163200,"02 12, 2014",2014,4232,"['had', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'film', 'theatrical', 'release', '3D', 'have', 'wondered', 'just', 'how', 'well', 'would', 'hold', 'up', 'home', 'video', 'viewing', 'computer', 'can', 'say', 'question', 'one', 'best', 'movie', 'experiences', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'even', 'when', 'reduced', 'smaller', 'screen', '3D', 'had', 'trouble', 'streaming', 'Amazon', 'picture', 'was', 'clear', 'HD', 'way.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'performance', 'career', 'astronaut', 'caught', 'disaster', 'seemingly', 'hope', 'rescue', 'George', 'Clooney', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'commander', 'mission', 'who', 'Bullock', 'must', 'leave', 'destroyed', 'shuttle', 'order', 'reach', 'International', 'Space', 'Station.This', 'film', 'clocks', '90', 'minutes', 'not', 'including', 'credits', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'minute', 'Even', 'quiet', 'times', 'relentless', 'pressure', 'constantly', 'being', 'cranked', 'up', 'Bullock', 'Clooney', 'must', 'race', 'clock', 'get', 'back', 'Earth', 'Alfonso', 'Cuaron', 'co-wrote', 'directed', 'film', 'many', 'previous', 'works', 'create', 'marvelous', 'world', 'inhabit', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'When', 'consider', 'only', 'see', 'two', 'people', 'alive', 'third', 'astronaut', 'shown', 'never', 'see', 'face', 'entirely', 'nearly', '90', 'minutes', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'faith', 'placed', 'actors', 'two', 'pros', 'Bullock', 'Clooney', 'really', 'piece', 'cake', 'effortlessly', 'carry', 'film', 'anything', 'film', 'really', 'just', 'how', 'few', 'actors', 'can', 'pull', 'something', 'off', 'so', 'easily.The', 'world', 'Gravity', 'one', 'familiar', 'yet', 'non-existent', 'have', 'not', 'flown', 'space', 'shuttles', 'few', 'years', 'yet', 'according', 'STS', 'mission', 'film', 'set', 'roughly', '2014/2015', 'Chinese', 'station', 'mentioned', 'exist', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'complete', 'depicted', 'So', 'Gravity', 'place', 'alternate', 'world', 'can', 'certainly', 'relate', 'may', 'be', 'due', 'fact', 'script', 'had', 'been', 'first', 'written', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'only', 'now', 'was', 'Cuaron', 'able', 'make', 'reality.The', 'CGI', 'naturally', 'compelling', 'excitingly', 'rendered', 'core', 'Gravity', 'heart', 'experimental', 'film', 'opening', 'shot', 'lasts', '12', 'minutes', 'unbroken', 'completely', 'mesmerizing', 'are', 'introduced', 'characters', 'also', 'switch', 'points', 'view', 'being', 'far', 'away', 'action', 'actually', 'seeing', 'what', 'happening', 'Bullock', 'eyes', 'Bullock', 'little', 'terms', 'makeup', 'first', 'time', 'true', 'age', 'show', 'asset', 'not', 'detriment', 'actress', 'who', 'powerful', 'heartfelt', 'incisive', 'performance', 'really', 'wonder', 'why', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'short', 'list', 'actresses', 'role', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'final', 'sequence', 'film', 'yet', '34', 'experimental', '34', 'effect', 'really', 'quite', 'profound', 'when', 'understand', 'what', 'director', 'had', 'mind.I', 'realize', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'hype', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'read', 'critic', 'review', 'comparing', 'Bullock', 'performance', 'Rene', 'Marie', 'Falconetti', '34', 'Passion', 'Joan', 'Arc', '34', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'performance', 'ever', 'filmed', 'No', 'Bullock', 'not', 'THAT', 'good', 'wonderful', 'see', 'emotions', 'cascade', 'face', 'even', 'tacked-on', 'bit', 'background', 'Bullock', 'character', 'daughter', 'pay', 'off', 'later', 'film', 'hardly', 'false', 'note', 'sense', 'wasted', 'shot', 'Cuaron', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'directing', 'film', 'everything', 'needed', 'not', 'one', 'thing', 'more.I', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'best', 'film', '2013', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'nominees', 'However', 'film', 'true', 'game-changer', 'terms', 'just', 'how', 'create', 'action/disaster', 'film', 'have', 'little', 'doubt', 'big-budget', 'CGI', 'films', 'are', 'planning', 'stages', 'are', 'taking', 'lessons', 'how', 'create', 'true', 'thrill', 'ride', 'movie', 'Gravity', 'more', 'just', 'great', 'thrill', 'ride', 'however', 'actually', 'felt', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'was', 'gripping', 'arms', 'chair', 'very', 'rare', 'feeling', 'indeed']",N/A

Then when George Clooney dies off (sorry spoiler) then your down to just Sandra and Sandra alone as the only character.It was disappointing to see Sandra struggle with her past, but yet it was all her verbal talk, they could have included some flashbacks of that past......It would have been nice to have included NASA in Houston and how they reacted to the entire situation.... from their perspective.If a person spent that much time spinning as Sandra did in the beginning of the movie wouldn't they get sick to their stomach?  What stopped her spinning, since I thought motion kept just happening in space unless something stopped it....Then when she landed, it would have been nice to have Sandra walk or whatever until she was rescued, NASA in Houstons reaction when they found out she was alive and landed they can only assume safely.  I think you know what I mean.But basically it's a movie with only two characters and a voice in Houston that is NASA.  Bug disappointment.If I had to say something positive about the film it would be the views.... the views looking down to earth are amazing and really gives you the feeling of what it's like for what those that actually make it up into space see.  Seeing the earth from above was beautiful.  But I have to wonder if the ring of fire is really that visible from space.....",1,disappointing.....

It takes place in Earth's orbit, where the crew of mission STS-157 is doing some work on the Hubble telescope, when they are ordered by mission control in Houston to return to Earth immediately. Russia has unwisely shot down a defunct satellite, and the debris from the explosion has caused a chain reaction, sending a wave of debris from other satellites hurtling toward the astronauts. Mission Specialist Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), an engineer, veteran Mission Commander Lt. Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), and another astronaut are outside the Space Shuttle Explorer when they receive the message and are unable to take shelter in time. The Shuttle damaged, their colleagues killed, Ryan and Kowalski survive tethered together. Their only hope is to use Kowalski's Manned Maneuvering Unit to propel themselves to the nearby International Space Station, where they hope to find means to return to Earth.""Gravity"" reminds me of the movie ""Cast Away"" (2000) in that it pits a lone human against nature in a struggle to survive, relying on one actor to carry the film. Though, in ""Gravity"", the astronaut's ordeal is punctuated by action sequences to keep the audience from realizing that we are watching a film about humanity's place in the universe. There is hope and hopelessness, isolation and connection, in Ryan Stone's struggle not just to stay alive, but to find a reason to do so. Stone's tearjerker backstory and the fact that she is buffeted about by catastrophe after catastrophe are lazy gimmicks employed to make sure we don't lose interest in her plight. A more typical, driven, careerist astronaut would have been more interesting and more difficult to write. Keeping our interest without the pyrotechnics would have been more challenging. The wave of debris takes 90 minutes to complete one orbit, so it conveniently wreaks havoc like clockwork. Nevertheless, ""Gravity"" creates real suspense and manages to be genuinely moving at times. And I like that it is essentially cinematic, tending to tell its story with images rather than words.",4,Strong Images Underlie Contemplative Science Fiction Punctuated by Action.,1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,2208,"['Gravity', 'occasionally', 'contemplative', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'directed', 'Alfonso', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'written', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'son', 'Jon', 'aacute', 's.', 'place', 'Earth', 'orbit', 'where', 'crew', 'mission', 'STS-157', 'doing', 'work', 'Hubble', 'telescope', 'when', 'are', 'ordered', 'mission', 'control', 'Houston', 'return', 'Earth', 'immediately', 'Russia', 'unwisely', 'shot', 'down', 'defunct', 'satellite', 'debris', 'explosion', 'caused', 'chain', 'reaction', 'sending', 'wave', 'debris', 'other', 'satellites', 'hurtling', 'astronauts', 'Mission', 'Specialist', 'Dr.', 'Ryan', 'Stone', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'engineer', 'veteran', 'Mission', 'Commander', 'Lt.', 'Matt', 'Kowalski', 'George', 'Clooney', 'astronaut', 'are', 'Space', 'Shuttle', 'Explorer', 'when', 'receive', 'message', 'are', 'unable', 'take', 'shelter', 'time', 'Shuttle', 'damaged', 'colleagues', 'killed', 'Ryan', 'Kowalski', 'survive', 'tethered', 'together', 'only', 'hope', 'use', 'Kowalski', 'Manned', 'Maneuvering', 'Unit', 'propel', 'nearby', 'International', 'Space', 'Station', 'where', 'hope', 'find', 'means', 'return', 'Earth', 'Gravity', 'movie', 'Cast', 'Away', '2000', 'lone', 'human', 'nature', 'struggle', 'survive', 'relying', 'one', 'actor', 'carry', 'film', 'Though', 'Gravity', 'astronaut', 'ordeal', 'punctuated', 'action', 'sequences', 'keep', 'audience', 'realizing', 'are', 'watching', 'film', 'humanity', 'place', 'universe', 'hope', 'hopelessness', 'isolation', 'connection', 'Ryan', 'Stone', 'struggle', 'not', 'just', 'stay', 'alive', 'find', 'reason', 'do', 'so', 'Stone', 'tearjerker', 'backstory', 'fact', 'buffeted', 'catastrophe', 'catastrophe', 'are', 'lazy', 'gimmicks', 'employed', 'make', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'lose', 'interest', 'plight', 'more', 'typical', 'driven', 'careerist', 'astronaut', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'more', 'difficult', 'write', 'Keeping', 'interest', 'pyrotechnics', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'challenging', 'wave', 'debris', '90', 'minutes', 'complete', 'one', 'orbit', 'conveniently', 'havoc', 'clockwork', 'Nevertheless', 'Gravity', 'creates', 'real', 'suspense', 'manages', 'be', 'genuinely', 'moving', 'times', 'like', 'essentially', 'cinematic', 'tending', 'tell', 'story', 'images', 'rather', 'words']",N/A

1685702,AR8HCCLIFWQHP,B00H83EUL2,Mirror_Matter,"[22, 36]","NO SPOILER GUARANTEEThis is a survival movie.  You know that in the first 5 minutes when only Clooney and Bullock are left alive.  I was so sure that we would enjoy this movie, being a fan of both Clooney and Bullock (who isn't?) that I did not mind actually buying the movie through Amazon when the rental was not available.  But I was wincing in pain most of the movie.  I certainly wanted Bullock to survive, but she is panicky and whining through most of the movie.  This seems a great insult to female astronauts and the NASA training program.  There is no sign of the stoic &#34;Houston, we have a problem.&#34;  Clooney remains calm in a Han Solo grinning way which only adds to the insult to women.  Bullock is allowed to panic and cry and freeze up in a way that would be completely unacceptable for a male astronaut.  Sure, bullock is supposed to be the scientist, but do you think female scientists are incapable of staying calm under pressure and following their training?  In a movie asserting itself to be so realistic, this seems fatally unrealistic.  We see more bravery from Bullock as an average citizen in the movie Speed (good movie).The next fatal flaw is in how they eliminate Clooney.  This movie tries so hard to be realistic that it eliminates sound in all the space crashing scenes, which of course is correct because space cannot transmit sound (But this lack of sound reduces the drama).  Then in one of the most pivotal scenes, Bullock holds onto Clooney who was drifting away with a cord.  The drift (not a fall) is arrested at the last minute, but Clooney exclaims that the cord will not hold.  Hold what?  The momentum that he had was stopped.  There is no force pulling on him at this point.  Well, actually there is, gravity, but the way gravity would work in space would be to pull him slightly toward Bullock and the rest of the debris.  Instead the movie plays it like two rock climbers on one rope and the guy at the bottom cuts the cord to save the other (See Day After Tomorrow or Vertical Limit - both excellent movies). So they wanted to create a situation where Bullock would be left alone.  But this situation is contrived in a way that suggest the characters and the movie makers no nothing about GRAVITY!Other annoying mistakes is that Bullock would not know that when she uses the fire extinguisher that there would be an equal and opposite reaction sending her flying and almost killing herself.  This is used as foreshadowing where she takes this knowledge to use the extinguisher to fly her to safety.  But are we expected to believe that she never received training on how a fire extinguisher works in space.  She make several of these kinds of mistakes which suggest she is either the worst astronaut in history, or that NASA apparently does not train very well, or most insulting, women somehow cannot retain their training.  Then we are expected to believe that such a rookie has no problem figuring out another country's complicated space systems by referring quickly to a manual.Every science fiction movie takes liberties with the way the physical world really works, but this movie is painful because it is basically trying to base its reputation on its realism.  The special effects are impressive, but I would not agree that we are in new territory.  And the story itself has such flaws that I really did not much care if Bullock's character lived or died by the end (and I love Bullock).  I think the academy award should go to the marketing department for this movie which sold the actors and the special effects so well that the story became irrelevant.

1685704,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B00H83EUL2,mitchell5954,"[4, 6]","Gravity is, to me, one of the big surprises of the year.  Out of all the hyped up films this year or even this season, this movie was the one of ones I did not really care to see.  It looked slightly cool from the trailer, but I thought I could easily wait to see it on DVD.  However, as the film was coming out I saw all the reviews and positive feedback the film was getting.  Gravity has about a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes at the moment and reviewers I listen to on YouTube gave it really high marks.  So with this film doing so well critically I thought I&#8217;d be remiss if I did not see this film in the theatre.  I will say that this film should definitely be seen in theatres or IMAX, or you will be missing out.  This film was a really pleasant surprise for me.  The film looks amazing, has characters you care for, it keeps you on the edge of your seat, and has a great atmosphere.The story is as follows.  You have this group of astronauts headed by Matt (George Clooney) and Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) who are on a mission to make modifications on the Hubble Space Telescope.  However, mission control (played by Ed Harris) informs them that the Russians blew up one of their own satellites which caused a chain reaction which caused other satellites to go down and that the debris is heading right for them.  The shuttle gets hit and everyone dies except for Ryan and Matt.  Now these two have to survive and get back to Earth.First of all, the film looks brilliant.  I just watched it in 2D, so I can only imagine how it looks in 3D.  I do not have a theatre around here that has 3D so I cannot watch it in that format.  I would think it would be pretty scary in 3D.  I heard the 3D is amazing so see the film in 3D if you can.  The CGI is great!  It actually feels like you are in space throughout the entire film.  You get many beautiful birds-eye-view shots of Earth.The action you get is great as well and it keeps you on edge.  This film does an outstanding job at building suspense.  Literally every five minutes there is a suspenseful moment that keeps you on edge and it keeps that up until the very end of the film.  The audience barely gets a chance to breathe between all these dire situations Sandra Bullock is put through.The characters are both likable and ones you easily get attached to.  You really feel sorry for Sandra Bullock&#8217;s character.  Having to be in such a situation is very horrible and I liked how she dealt with it all.  Some may complain that she is to whiny in the beginning, but if anyone was put in that situation we would be just as frightened as she was if not more so.  This movie made me never want to go into space.George Clooney&#8217;s character is also very likable.  He is pretty much the voice of reason for Ryan and he helps her throughout the film.  He is also very laid-back and a bit funny as well which you welcome in a film like this.  I really like George Clooney as an actor.  He has done some film that I really do not like (Batman and Robin) but he also has done some movies I like this one.  Regardless of the movie he is in I always like him though.Overall, Gravity is a must see film.  You definitely should see in on the big screen in 3D or IMAX if you can.  However, the film does work well in 2D as well.  The film is definitely a wild ride.",5,Biggest Surprise on 2013!,1393718400,"03 2, 2014",2014,3323,"['Gravity', 'one', 'big', 'surprises', 'year', 'hyped', 'up', 'films', 'year', 'even', 'season', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'ones', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'care', 'see', 'looked', 'slightly', 'cool', 'trailer', 'thought', 'could', 'easily', 'wait', 'see', 'DVD', 'However', 'film', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'saw', 'reviews', 'positive', 'feedback', 'film', 'was', 'getting', 'Gravity', '98', '%', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'moment', 'reviewers', 'listen', 'YouTube', 'gave', 'really', 'high', 'marks', 'So', 'film', 'doing', 'so', 'well', 'critically', 'thought', '8217', 'be', 'remiss', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'film', 'theatre', 'will', 'say', 'film', 'should', 'definitely', 'be', 'seen', 'theatres', 'IMAX', 'will', 'be', 'missing', 'out', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'film', 'amazing', 'characters', 'care', 'edge', 'seat', 'great', 'atmosphere.The', 'story', 'have', 'group', 'astronauts', 'headed', 'Matt', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Dr.', 'Ryan', 'Stone', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'who', 'are', 'mission', 'make', 'modifications', 'Hubble', 'Space', 'Telescope', 'However', 'mission', 'control', 'played', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Russians', 'blew', 'up', 'one', 'own', 'satellites', 'caused', 'chain', 'reaction', 'caused', 'other', 'satellites', 'go', 'down', 'debris', 'heading', 'right', 'shuttle', 'hit', 'everyone', 'dies', 'Ryan', 'Matt', 'Now', 'two', 'have', 'survive', 'get', 'back', 'Earth.First', 'film', 'brilliant', 'just', 'watched', '2D', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', '3D', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'theatre', 'around', 'here', '3D', 'can', 'not', 'watch', 'format', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'scary', '3D', 'heard', '3D', 'amazing', 'so', 'see', 'film', '3D', 'can', 'CGI', 'great', 'actually', 'are', 'space', 'entire', 'film', 'get', 'many', 'beautiful', 'birds-eye-view', 'shots', 'Earth.The', 'action', 'get', 'great', 'well', 'edge', 'film', 'outstanding', 'job', 'building', 'suspense', 'Literally', 'five', 'minutes', 'suspenseful', 'moment', 'edge', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'audience', 'barely', 'chance', 'breathe', 'dire', 'situations', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'put', 'through.The', 'characters', 'are', 'likable', 'ones', 'easily', 'get', 'attached', 'really', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', '8217', 's', 'character', 'Having', 'be', 'such', 'situation', 'very', 'horrible', 'liked', 'how', 'may', 'complain', 'whiny', 'beginning', 'anyone', 'was', 'put', 'situation', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'frightened', 'was', 'not', 'more', 'so', 'movie', 'made', 'never', 'want', 'go', 'space.George', 'Clooney', '8217', 's', 'character', 'also', 'very', 'likable', 'pretty', 'much', 'voice', 'reason', 'Ryan', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'laid-back', 'bit', 'funny', 'well', 'welcome', 'film', 'really', 'George', 'Clooney', 'actor', 'done', 'film', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'also', 'done', 'movies', 'like', 'one', 'Regardless', 'movie', 'always', 'though.Overall', 'Gravity', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'definitely', 'should', 'see', 'big', 'screen', '3D', 'IMAX', 'can', 'However', 'film', 'work', 'well', '2D', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'definitely', 'wild', 'ride']",N/A
1685705,A1WYENJ1QI2S7I,B00H83EUL2,"mitch ""mitch4406""","[1, 3]","This movie was throughly enjoyable and no doubt will clean up at the Oscars (although I don't see it getting best picture). In discussion and reviews I've heard it referred to as 'science- fiction.' This is somewhat misleading. Although it features fictional characters the story focuses on work NASA astronauts perform today, primarily NASA Mission Specialist Dr. Ryan Stone(Sandra Bullock).The Science Fiction category usally encompasses highly speculative films set in the far future, like the recent 'Prometheus' and 'Star Trek Into Darkness.' Gravity doesn't feature the warp drive that gets you across the galaxy in a heart beat. Instead we are treated to the heroic and often unheralded work of astronauts today, exploring nearby space as best as current technology and budgets will allow. Hopefully the take-away from this enjoyable film will be more people getting excited about the important work of space exploration today. In Gravity a catastrophic space accident(no spoilers here) wrecks Dr. Stone's ride back to Earth. Director Alfonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambien, Children of Men and the best Harry Potter - Prisoner of Azkaban) gives us a front row seat as she battles for survival. In the 'life is unfair' category Dr. Stone faces one problem after another(or multiple problems at the same time) searching for a way home. And her home is right there, filling the screen beautifully and majestically.Movies where dialog is limited due to all of the alone time by the main characters have to engage us in other ways(i.e,'WALL-E,' 'Castaway' and the classic 'Robinson Crusoe on Mars'). Through it's intensity and outstanding special effects this film does that. This nicely sets up the limited dialog where Dr. Stone, because she is so near to death, reflects meaningfully and poignantly on life. Viewing the film in IMAX 3D was awesome, definitely worth the extra money. Hopefully you'll have a nice home theatre set up so you can get the best viewing experience.",5,Gripping story of survival,1393200000,"02 24, 2014",2014,1976,"['movie', 'was', 'throughly', 'enjoyable', 'doubt', 'will', 'clean', 'up', 'Oscars', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'getting', 'best', 'picture', 'discussion', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'referred', ""'science-"", 'fiction', 'somewhat', 'misleading', 'fictional', 'characters', 'story', 'work', 'NASA', 'perform', 'today', 'primarily', 'NASA', 'Mission', 'Specialist', 'Dr.', 'Ryan', 'Stone', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', '.The', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'category', 'usally', 'highly', 'speculative', 'films', 'set', 'far', 'future', 'recent', ""'Star"", 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'Gravity', ""n't"", 'feature', 'warp', 'drive', 'galaxy', 'heart', 'beat', 'Instead', 'are', 'treated', 'heroic', 'often', 'unheralded', 'work', 'astronauts', 'today', 'exploring', 'nearby', 'space', 'as', 'best', 'current', 'technology', 'budgets', 'will', 'allow', 'Hopefully', 'take-away', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'people', 'getting', 'excited', 'important', 'work', 'space', 'exploration', 'today', 'Gravity', 'catastrophic', 'space', 'accident', 'spoilers', 'here', 'wrecks', 'Dr.', 'Stone', 'ride', 'back', 'Earth', 'Director', 'Alfonso', 'Cuaron', 'Y', 'Tu', 'Mama', 'Tambien', 'Children', 'Men', 'best', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Prisoner', 'Azkaban', 'front', 'row', 'seat', 'survival', ""'life"", 'unfair', 'category', 'Dr.', 'Stone', 'one', 'problem', 'multiple', 'problems', 'same', 'time', 'searching', 'way', 'home', 'home', 'right', 'there', 'filling', 'screen', 'beautifully', 'majestically.Movies', 'where', 'dialog', 'limited', 'due', 'alone', 'time', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'engage', 'other', 'ways', 'i.e', ""'WALL-E"", 'classic', ""'Robinson"", 'Crusoe', 'Mars', 'intensity', 'outstanding', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'nicely', 'up', 'limited', 'dialog', 'where', 'Dr.', 'Stone', 'so', 'near', 'death', 'meaningfully', 'poignantly', 'life', 'Viewing', 'film', 'IMAX', '3D', 'was', 'awesome', 'definitely', 'extra', 'money', 'Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'have', 'nice', 'home', 'theatre', 'set', 'up', 'can', 'get', 'best', 'viewing', 'experience']",N/A

I missed seeing Gravity in the theater, but friends who saw it lamented the needlessly unrealistic depiction of operations in space.  ""Okay,"" I thought.  ""I can probably look past that if it's a good story.""And maybe I could have.  But the entire opening scene was so chock full of stilted, trite, off-pace dialog that I was already reaching for the remote.  But, I had friends over for the movie, so we pressed bravely on.Suffice it to say, if you have ever watched more than about five minutes of video from NASA, you will realize that all of the behavior exhibited by the characters in the movie is unrealistic.  If you know anything at all about space and space science, you will realize that the plot of the film -- from the crisis that precipitates the action to literally every step taken to resolve the crisis -- is impossible.If you know anything about physics, you will be simultaneously infuriated and amazed.  Infuriated at all the things they got absurdly wrong, but amazed at how beautifully the things they got right were depicted.  It's pretty clear that one area where they did put some effort into things was in the depiction of the microgravity (""zero g"") environment, and how objects and other phenomena look.And ultimately, looks are the name of the game here.  Especially in 3D, the movie is visually spectacular.  As much as I would like to get rid of this disc while there's still interest on the used market, I will probably keep it because some of the visuals are so amazing.  One image of an astronaut floating, with only the Milky Way and the stars beyond, was just jaw dropping.To wrap up: If you go into this movie purely for the visual spectacle, and you can ignore bad writing, bad acting and massive plot problems, then you can probably enjoy it.

Well, it lives up to the expectations and then exceeds them by leaps and bounds.Gravity is without a doubt, the single most intense, beautiful and (literally) breathtaking film I&#8217;ve ever seen. I&#8217;ve been a huge fan of director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n ever since I saw Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban, my first taste of his amazing style and vision. I was further convinced of his masterful sense of filmmaking after seeing Children of Men and his breakthrough Y Tu Mam&aacute; Tambi&eacute;n. Cuar&oacute;n not only has fantastic style, but one of his trademarks are now incredibly long single take tracking shots. Most people don&#8217;t notice long, single takes and that there isn&#8217;t a cut if it&#8217;s done well.Gravity continues this incredible feat with a 17 minute opening shot! It&#8217;s a remarkable feat and you become absolutely lost in the film seconds into it. It&#8217;s a breathtaking film filled with some of the most beautiful cinematography in recent memory. Sandra Bullock plays the heroine Ryan Stone in a riveting performance. I haven&#8217;t seen a more worthy Oscar performance yet this year. George Clooney, as Matt Kowalski, is also great, adding a sense of humor and calm to a chaotic situation.Arguably most impressive about the film, is it&#8217;s attention to detail and realism. Yes, it&#8217;s a work of fiction and some scientific artistic merits were taken to advance the story, but ultimately it stays true to the realities of space. No sound. No gravity. No oxygen. Life can not exist there. These truths constantly run through your mind as you watch the characters struggle and fight for survival. The musical score is powerful and terrifying, amping up the reality of the scenes unfolding before you. I was clenching my armrest and reminding myself to breath throughout the film.It is without a doubt, a remarkable piece of filmmaking. If you&#8217;re able to handle the intense and nerve-rattling story, it&#8217;s an absolute must see. Just remember to breathe.NOTE: I saw it in 3D and on a huge screen. If you&#8217;re able to see it in 3D, you really should. It isn&#8217;t gimmicky 3D, it just adds astounding depth to a visually remarkable film.",5,"Stunning, Breathtaking and For Once Worth the 3D",1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,2736,"['Let', '8217', 'put', 'way', '8211', 'Gravity', 'now', 'top', 'three', 'favorite', 'films', 'all-time', 'Previously', 'top', 'three', 'were', 'Empire', 'Strikes', 'Back', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'Casablanca', 'Gravity', 'now', 'top', 'three', '8217', 'spot', 'being', 'internally', 'debated', '8217', 'good.If', 'haven', '8217', 'seen', 'trailers', 'film', 'group', 'astronauts', 'who', 'are', 'hit', 'satellite', 'debris', 'have', 'fight', 'survival', '8217', 'seen', 'trailer', '8217', 'aware', 'how', 'intense', 'Gravity', 'Well', 'up', 'expectations', 'then', 'exceeds', 'leaps', 'bounds.Gravity', 'doubt', 'single', 'most', 'intense', 'beautiful', 'literally', 'breathtaking', 'film', '8217', 'ever', 'seen', '8217', 've', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'director', 'Alfonso', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'ever', 'saw', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Prisoner', 'Azkaban', 'first', 'taste', 'amazing', 'style', 'vision', 'was', 'further', 'convinced', 'masterful', 'sense', 'filmmaking', 'seeing', 'Children', 'Men', 'breakthrough', 'Y', 'Tu', 'Mam', 'aacute', 'Tambi', 'eacute', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'not', 'only', 'fantastic', 'style', 'one', 'trademarks', 'are', 'now', 'incredibly', 'long', 'single', 'take', 'tracking', 'shots', 'Most', 'people', 'don', '8217', 'notice', 'long', 'single', 'isn', '8217', 'cut', '8217', 'done', 'well.Gravity', 'incredible', 'feat', '17', 'minute', 'opening', 'shot', '8217', 's', 'remarkable', 'feat', 'become', 'absolutely', 'lost', 'film', '8217', 's', 'breathtaking', 'film', 'filled', 'most', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'recent', 'memory', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'heroine', 'Ryan', 'Stone', 'riveting', 'performance', 'haven', '8217', 'seen', 'more', 'worthy', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'yet', 'year', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Matt', 'Kowalski', 'also', 'great', 'adding', 'sense', 'humor', 'calm', 'chaotic', 'situation.Arguably', 'most', 'impressive', 'film', '8217', 'attention', 'detail', 'realism', 'Yes', '8217', 's', 'work', 'fiction', 'scientific', 'artistic', 'merits', 'were', 'taken', 'advance', 'story', 'ultimately', 'true', 'realities', 'space', 'sound', 'gravity', 'oxygen', 'Life', 'can', 'not', 'exist', 'there', 'truths', 'constantly', 'run', 'mind', 'watch', 'characters', 'struggle', 'fight', 'survival', 'musical', 'score', 'powerful', 'terrifying', 'amping', 'up', 'reality', 'scenes', 'unfolding', 'was', 'clenching', 'armrest', 'reminding', 'breath', 'film.It', 'doubt', 'remarkable', 'piece', 'filmmaking', '8217', 'able', 'handle', 'intense', 'nerve-rattling', 'story', '8217', 'absolute', 'must', 'see', 'Just', 'remember', 'breathe.NOTE', 'saw', '3D', 'huge', 'screen', '8217', 'able', 'see', '3D', 'really', 'should', '8217', 'gimmicky', '3D', 'just', 'astounding', 'depth', 'visually', 'remarkable', 'film']",N/A

1685718,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00H83EUL2,M. Oleson,"[47, 67]","Theatrical review. There may be spoilers. See below for Blu ray update.Most movie lovers can remember seeing a film for the first time that really got their attention. Usually it was in a real movie theater. For me it was ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" The juxtaposition of a flung femur bone transfiguring into a space shuttle lining up to dock at an orbiting station, all to the backdrop of classical music was mind blowing to this science fiction lover. A few year later, sitting in a large theater I was again mesmerized by a giant space ship moving slowly across dark space. ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" had a new technical trick at its disposal. Dolby Surround Sound. A new generation will likely have ""Gravity"" to look back on. Yes, it's that good.Director Alfonso Cuaron (""Children of Men""), who also wrote the screenplay with his son Jonas, has managed to provide an electrifying thriller with a basic story. A flight crew headed by Lt. (a lieutenant, really?) Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) have been sent to repair the Hubble Telescope. The scientist in charge of the repairs is the ever-so-serious Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock). There are no other actors who have any role of substance other than the voice of Ed Harris at Mission Control early on.In a quick turn of events, it is learned that the Russians have destroyed one of their spy satellites. The explosion has set off a chain reaction of debris hurtling through space taking out other satellites along the way. With only minutes to react, Kowalski's crew attempt to get the shuttle out of orbit. They don't. Now in survival mode, Kowalski and Stone must figure out how to get back to Earth. This becomes even more complicated, as radio communication with Mission Control has been severed.Cuaron provides Sandra Bullock an opportunity to show her acting range and she responds with a performance that will be remembered for a long time. Stone's early panic, as the space debris knocks her away from Kowalski and the shuttle, comes across to the audience. We see the terror in her eyes, in her breathing and in the fogging helmet shield. The other star of the film is Cuaron's cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki and the visual and special effects department. It is the most amazing thing I think I've ever seen on screen. And yes, see it now. Don't wait for this movie to come to you by Netflix. And yes, see it in 3D. I pick and choose when to spend an extra $3 or $4 dollars on 3D and I made the right decision here.Gravity has several meanings. The most used and obvious one for this movie has to do with the force of bodies falling toward Earth. But gravity also is defined as a serious or critical nature. Also, serious or dignified behavior. All apply. Cuaron and his team will likely need a truck to load nominations come Oscar time. Don't miss it.BLU RAY UPDATE: I recently acquired a 3D television and having swooned over this film (3D) in theaters last fall, I couldn't think of a better movie to test out the display.  It didn't disappoint.  The package includes 3D and 2D options (separate discs) and a DVD.  It also includes a digital HD (Ultraviolet) download.  The special features are on the 2D disc.I'm not surprised that the film retains the awe-inspiring luster of the theatrical version.  It comes with 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The 3D, much like the big screen version uses the extra dimension to create depth of space which is certainly appropriate for a film which takes place in space orbiting around Earth.  The color and sometimes lack of, is excellent along with deep, dark blacks.  Shadows are in proper contrast and detail is remarkable.  Check out hair stubble on Clooney's face and watch Bullock as she strains, once reaching the temporary safety of the International Space Station.  Her neck muscles stretch and relax.  Great acting and great cinematography.  I can't say enough about the 3D element here.  Frankly, I'm not a big fan as a rule.  Still there are a few that get it right (""Avatar"" and ""Hugo"" come to mind).  ""Gravity"" joins the club.  While I did not watch the 2D version from beginning to end, I did see enough to that nothing is lost other than the depth.  In either case, the discs are demo quality.Likewise the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is flawless.  It does a perfect job handling the big collision scenes and the subwoofer certainly got a workout in that regard along with the surrounds.  But there are other elements well played out that I didn't notice as much the first time around.  First is the use of silence.  Director Cuaron and his Oscar winning sound squad have done a marvelous job, not only creating some unusual sounds but have integrated them beautifully into the various elements of the film.  One second there are loud collisions, total silence the next.  The sound of small fires starting and the whoosh of a fire extinguisher or a jet propulsion pack.  It's just incredible.  The other major element so important in the film is the soundtrack by another Oscar winner, Steven Price.  It never resorts to an overabundance of strings, but it emphasizes the emotions and terrors of the moment.  The lossless audio track handles it perfectly.  Subtitles are available in English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.There are a host of extras:*Gravity: Mission Control (HD, 107 minutes) A behind-the-scenes documentary.  Segments include:&#9702;It Began with a Story (16:21)&#9702;Initial Challenges: Long Shots and Zero G (10:12)&#9702;Previsualizing Gravity (11:38)&#9702;The Hues of Space (10:41)&#9702;Physical

It's an experience that doesn't ask you to think about what's going on as much as it demands you to experience what's going on.  Pretty much from the word go,this film just starts building and stacking on tension and it just doesn't stop. It keeps coming at you from every which direction and before you know it the rides over and you want to jump back in line to get on it again.For that very same reason though I can understand why some people won't like this film. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney both put on great performances but this isn't really a movie about an amazing ensemble cast,or a political,or social issue that will spark up a debate or thought provoking idea after you're done watching it. I would even argue this isn't a movie strictly about it's visuals. It's simply a visceral,and vicarious experience of surviving. So in that sense it kind of does leave you wondering what was the whole point by the films conclusion,but for me it's  something to watch simply for the spectacle,for the ride.the 3D is very solid and the movie as a whole looks pretty amazing. Their are a few really nice pop out effects but i feel the best 3D scenes showcase the depth of outer space. As you're watching in certain moments the astronauts grow smaller as they float out into the endless darkness and you can really feel the depth in those scenes. I can't help but wonder if watching this in 2D for the first time would take away that feeling or not. To me the only shortcoming for this bluray 3D release is that it's not an IMAX 3D bluray which I felt would have been a much better showcase for this film. Had that been the case I think this would have been worthy of fives stars across the board. It's a shame too,because it feels like such a missed opportunity to really immerse you within the film.",4,4 stars for the film 4 stars for the 3D.

Maybe there is something intelligent or interesting about watching characters bounce around in spacesuits from one disintegrating spacecraft to another, but maybe after you have seen one spacewalk and one spacecraft disintegrate you do not need to see the same things over and over.There were some unintentionally funny parts, however, such as attempts at deep philosophy about life and death and the will to live recited by a delirious Sandra Bullock; or perhaps when the ghost of George Clooney miraculously appears like a deus ex machina to give Sandra a little uplifting advice.  But the funniest parts of all concern the helpless woman stereotype when Sandra tries to learn how to ""drive"" various spaceships made by various countries simply by quickly scanning the handy user's manuals.  But, hey, she is a ""doctor,"" like most females leads in movies for the last 20 years, so she is a quick study.There were no sick scenes in the movie, unless you count seeing Sandra Bullock in her underwear twice.  If she were any older, those same scenes would probably have been too painful to watch.All in all, this is a typical end-of-career movie for some top-billing actors.  This is where they usually end up, in a second-rate sci-fi full of special effects, simpleminded dialog, and no requirement for any acting ability.  After this, they usually play senile geezer roles.__________________________________________________________________________* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category.

However, for me, it was not a must see.  I grouped it that selection of films that I would see in the theater if friends wanted to go see it, or I happened to be downtown one day, with time to spare, and the film was about the play.  Once I saw it was only 90 minutes along (an unheard of running time in this era of 2  - 3 hour films), it move higher on my list since the time investment would not be that great.  All I can say is that I am incredibly glad I did go see this film on the big screen.Starring mega-wattage actors George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, &#8220;Gravity&#8221; is the story of a routine Space Shuttle mission that goes horribly wrong when a Russian attempt to dispose of one of their own satellites is botched, triggering a chain reaction of debris that threatens everything in orbit and devastates the Shuttle.  Clooney and Bullock are the only survivors remaining and their desperate goal is to find a way to outlast the debris storm and find a passage back to Earth using any of the available means that have not yet been destroyed.The wonderment of space, the race against time, and the feeling of claustrophobia are common thematic elements since the beginning of cinema.  In the hands of a lesser director, they could be mishandled and come off as badly clich&eacute;d.  Fortunately, the expert hands of Alfonso Cuaron (&#8220;Children of Men&#8221; and &#8220;Y Tu Mama Tambien&#8221;) manages to hit the right chord with every narrative development.  The breathless tension remains high throughout the film and Cuaron takes no shortcuts in showcasing the challenges the survivors face.The acting is first rate in this film.  It&#8217;s not hard to see Sandra Bullock receiving an Academy Award nomination for her performance.  What also helps strengthen &#8220;Gravity&#8221; is that the science in the film, for the most part, is sound.  Too many space-based films play fast and loose with the laws of physics.  Yet, with the exception of a couple of deviations made for narrative purposes, &#8220;Gravity&#8221; remains true.The final aspect of this film that will captivate audiences is the stunning visual experience.  &#8220;Gravity&#8221; is one of those films that needs to be experienced on the big screen and, if possible, in 3-D.  It is a piece of cinema that knows how to use 3-D in service of the story, instead of as a gimmick to distract the audience.  The experience of this visual drama is one that will stay with you long after you leave the theater as the scenes replay in your mind over and over again.",5,Visually stunning space drama that is one of the finest films of 2013,1385164800,"11 23, 2013",2013,2682,"['When', 'initially', 'read', 'movie', '8220', 'Gravity', '8221', 'coming', 'theaters', 'had', 'doubt', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'film', 'However', 'was', 'not', 'must', 'see', 'grouped', 'selection', 'films', 'would', 'see', 'theater', 'friends', 'wanted', 'go', 'see', 'happened', 'be', 'downtown', 'one', 'day', 'time', 'spare', 'film', 'was', 'play', 'saw', 'was', 'only', '90', 'minutes', 'along', 'unheard', 'running', 'time', 'era', '2', '3', 'hour', 'films', 'move', 'higher', 'list', 'time', 'investment', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'can', 'say', 'am', 'incredibly', 'glad', 'did', 'go', 'see', 'film', 'big', 'screen.Starring', 'mega-wattage', 'actors', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', '8220', 'Gravity', '8221', 'story', 'routine', 'Space', 'Shuttle', 'mission', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'when', 'Russian', 'attempt', 'dispose', 'one', 'own', 'satellites', 'botched', 'triggering', 'chain', 'reaction', 'debris', 'everything', 'orbit', 'Shuttle', 'Clooney', 'Bullock', 'are', 'only', 'survivors', 'remaining', 'desperate', 'goal', 'find', 'way', 'outlast', 'debris', 'storm', 'find', 'passage', 'back', 'Earth', 'using', 'available', 'means', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'destroyed.The', 'wonderment', 'space', 'race', 'time', 'feeling', 'claustrophobia', 'are', 'common', 'thematic', 'elements', 'beginning', 'cinema', 'hands', 'lesser', 'director', 'could', 'be', 'mishandled', 'come', 'off', 'badly', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Fortunately', 'expert', 'hands', 'Alfonso', 'Cuaron', '8220', 'Children', 'Men', '8221', '8220', 'Y', 'Tu', 'Mama', 'Tambien', '8221', 'hit', 'right', 'chord', 'narrative', 'development', 'breathless', 'tension', 'high', 'film', 'Cuaron', 'shortcuts', 'showcasing', 'challenges', 'survivors', 'face.The', 'acting', 'first', 'rate', 'film', '8217', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'receiving', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'performance', 'What', 'also', 'strengthen', '8220', 'Gravity', '8221', 'science', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'sound', 'Too', 'many', 'space-based', 'films', 'play', 'fast', 'loose', 'laws', 'physics', 'exception', 'couple', 'deviations', 'made', 'narrative', 'purposes', '8220', 'Gravity', '8221', 'true.The', 'final', 'aspect', 'film', 'will', 'captivate', 'audiences', 'stunning', 'visual', 'experience', '8220', 'Gravity', '8221', 'one', 'films', 'be', 'experienced', 'big', 'screen', 'possible', '3-D', 'piece', 'cinema', 'how', 'use', '3-D', 'service', 'story', 'instead', 'gimmick', 'distract', 'audience', 'experience', 'visual', 'drama', 'one', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'leave', 'theater', 'scenes', 'replay', 'mind', 'over', 'again']",N/A

The movie starts with an uninterrupted shot lasting a number of minutes as we get to know the characters played by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. I found myself staring at the big screen in total shock and awe (and I mean that as a compliment). Just when you think that's it's all form over substance, director and co-writer Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, previously best known for Y Tu Mam&aacute; Tambi&eacute;n (2001) and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004), in fact fleshes out the Sandra Bullock enough that we care for her and that we are emotionally invested, a key ingredient for any movie to be truly successful. And just when you think that you've seen it all, there is yet more to come. I was very impressed with Sandra Bullock's performance, and the buzz about her being nominated for Best Actress Oscar is certainly deserved. Last but certainly not least, I very much enjoyed the musical score by Steven Price (the soundtrack is available on Amazon).Bottom line: this movie truly is a one-of-a-kind movie, and a unique experience that you will best enjoy on the big screen and in 3D. (This movie is the best use of 3D since ""Avatar"".) If you haven't seen ""Gravity"" yet, believe the hype and do yourself a favor and go see this in the theatre.

1685808,A7DAL9PK7F4M1,B00H83EUL2,"Paul Donovan ""Paul Donovan""","[1, 5]","This film is visually stunning, technologically challenging, and psychologically tense.It's also nearly ruined by being overly sentimental.It stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Actually, they aren't just the stars, they are the entire live-action cast. Anyway, they both play astronauts as part of a team fixing something on the space shuttle. When a Russian satellite is destroyed, the resulting debris causes both of them to start floating away into the depths of space, where they will die a horrible lonely death unless they can find a way to rescue themselves. The whole movie is just the series of attempts made by Clooney and Bullock to get back into some spacecraft that can carry them back to Earth.This is probably the most scientifically accurate space movie I've ever seen. Without being anchored into a specific direction by gravity, there is no such thing as up and down, left and right. The film is shot with this constantly rotating perspective (if you get motion sick easily, this may be a problem for you). The film also acknowledges that since there is no air in space, there would be no noise - this is mostly followed in the film, although apparently fire extinguishers are exempt from this rule. Oh, and their actual plan to return to Earth is also scientifically impossible. I'm not giving anything away on screen, but in real life, they would be doomed 15 minutes into the movie.Although now that I think about it, their plan is not more impossible than the idea of Sandra Bullock being a genius astronaut (I mean, really? Considering only one female actor was needed for the entire damn film, how did we end up with the star of ""Miss Congeniality"" and ""The Net""?)The movie plays on the term ""gravity"", exploiting all the definitions of the word. At the same time, the movie tries to be about the importance of holding on to life in the face of near-certain death. This caused some emotionally manipulative moments that brought the natural drama to a screeching halt and threw me off the film's trajectory quicker than a corpse attached to a jetpack.Visually, the film is a masterpiece and should be seen on the big screen. It is creative, nerve-wracking, and serves as a fairly realistic impression of what it must be like to work in space.In terms of story and acting, however, you can wait for it to appear on Oprah's network.",4,"cool to watch, annoying to feel",1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,2359,"['film', 'visually', 'stunning', 'technologically', 'challenging', 'psychologically', 'tense.It', 'also', 'nearly', 'ruined', 'being', 'overly', 'sentimental.It', 'stars', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Actually', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'stars', 'are', 'entire', 'live-action', 'cast', 'Anyway', 'play', 'astronauts', 'part', 'team', 'fixing', 'something', 'space', 'shuttle', 'When', 'Russian', 'satellite', 'destroyed', 'resulting', 'debris', 'causes', 'start', 'floating', 'away', 'depths', 'space', 'where', 'will', 'die', 'horrible', 'lonely', 'death', 'can', 'find', 'way', 'rescue', 'whole', 'movie', 'just', 'series', 'attempts', 'made', 'Clooney', 'Bullock', 'get', 'back', 'spacecraft', 'can', 'carry', 'back', 'Earth.This', 'probably', 'most', 'scientifically', 'accurate', 'space', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'being', 'anchored', 'specific', 'direction', 'gravity', 'such', 'thing', 'down', 'left', 'right', 'film', 'shot', 'constantly', 'rotating', 'perspective', 'get', 'motion', 'sick', 'easily', 'may', 'be', 'problem', 'film', 'also', 'air', 'space', 'would', 'be', 'noise', 'mostly', 'followed', 'film', 'apparently', 'fire', 'extinguishers', 'are', 'exempt', 'rule', 'Oh', 'actual', 'plan', 'return', 'Earth', 'also', 'scientifically', 'impossible', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'screen', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'doomed', '15', 'minutes', 'movie.Although', 'now', 'think', 'plan', 'not', 'more', 'impossible', 'idea', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'being', 'genius', 'astronaut', 'mean', 'really', 'Considering', 'only', 'one', 'female', 'actor', 'was', 'needed', 'entire', 'damn', 'film', 'how', 'did', 'end', 'up', 'star', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'Net', 'movie', 'term', 'gravity', 'exploiting', 'definitions', 'word', 'same', 'time', 'movie', 'be', 'importance', 'holding', 'life', 'face', 'near-certain', 'death', 'caused', 'emotionally', 'manipulative', 'moments', 'brought', 'natural', 'drama', 'screeching', 'halt', 'threw', 'off', 'film', 'trajectory', 'quicker', 'corpse', 'attached', 'jetpack.Visually', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'big', 'screen', 'creative', 'nerve-wracking', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'impression', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'work', 'space.In', 'terms', 'story', 'acting', 'however', 'can', 'wait', 'appear', 'Oprah', 'network']",N/A

I rated it one star to better offset all of the delusional reviews on here:Visuals - 5 starsScreenplay - 2 starsDialogue - 1 starRealism - 1 starActing - 3 starsSoundtrack - 3 starsThat'd be a far more realistic rating. The only high points are the visual effects (although the initial shot of the CG shuttle looks a little fake) and getting to see more of Sandra's figure than usual. The dialogue is complete throw-away. The laws of physics, reality, and probability are grossly abused, in terms of positions of satellites, orbital mechanics, the fact that the debris field had no chance of intercepting the shuttle once, let alone THREE times. Actual spacesuit gloves are far too stiff to deftly grab at objects, but in the film they were grabbing things with ease. The jetpack's speed and maneuverability is greatly exaggerated compared to reality. Trying to navigate space with a fire extinguisher would be a very difficult task in reality....It's obvious that without any sort of monster in the film to scare us, they turned the debris into a kind of monster...Technical flaws aside, it's really the plot and character interaction that turned the film into a wash. The actors (Sandra B) are barely utilized in terms of their acting potential. I've also decided that George Clooney is really just a failed attempt to clone Sean Connery, and that his presence and demeanor is more often drab, annoying, and predictable than anything else. I'd rather have had Nicholas Cage. At least Nick is more interesting to watch.It's like the Director was out to make a movie that portrayed the calm quiet and nothingness of space, but then grew bored and decided that he wished he were instead making a space monster film, with peril and dangers attacking the crew at every turn. Ergo, the malignant debris field, the raging fire, etc. everything he can find is out to get them, save the spaceship itself.Even the absurd amount of action wouldn't be so bad if the character interaction were at least halfway decent. The acting itself isn't the problem, it's the Director's terrible direction combined with a mediocrely written screenplay. There was nothing going on between anyone to make it worth watching, like in the way Twister's interpersonal drama kept us hooked well beyond what the Twisters alone could do (or just about any other space oriented film I could name).Even the soundtrack is poorly conceived, trying to impress upon the audience the absolute quiet of space with that crescendoing sound that makes you expect an impinging disaster. It was cool the first time, but reusing it throughout the film turned it into a too-obvious, borderline amateurish gimmick.The only recent space drama I can think of that's worse than Gravity are the latest Star Trek reboot films, as if they ever had a snowball's chance in heck of capturing the vibe and spirit of what made TOS great, but that's another review.Bottom line is, this movie is a good rental, but there's no way it's good enough to justify owning it at full retail.",1,Grossly Overrated :(,1403308800,"06 21, 2014",2014,3089,"['movie', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'deserving', '5', 'stars', 'category', 'rated', 'one', 'star', 'better', 'offset', 'delusional', 'reviews', 'here', 'Visuals', '5', 'starsScreenplay', '2', 'starsDialogue', '1', 'starRealism', '1', 'starActing', '3', 'starsSoundtrack', '3', 'starsThat', ""'d"", 'be', 'far', 'more', 'realistic', 'rating', 'only', 'high', 'points', 'are', 'visual', 'effects', 'initial', 'shot', 'CG', 'shuttle', 'little', 'fake', 'getting', 'see', 'more', 'Sandra', 'figure', 'usual', 'dialogue', 'complete', 'throw-away', 'laws', 'physics', 'reality', 'probability', 'are', 'grossly', 'abused', 'terms', 'positions', 'satellites', 'orbital', 'mechanics', 'fact', 'debris', 'field', 'had', 'chance', 'intercepting', 'shuttle', 'once', 'let', 'alone', 'THREE', 'times', 'Actual', 'spacesuit', 'gloves', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'stiff', 'deftly', 'grab', 'objects', 'film', 'were', 'grabbing', 'things', 'ease', 'jetpack', 'speed', 'maneuverability', 'greatly', 'exaggerated', 'compared', 'reality', 'Trying', 'navigate', 'space', 'fire', 'extinguisher', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'task', 'reality', '.It', 'obvious', 'sort', 'monster', 'film', 'scare', 'turned', 'debris', 'kind', 'monster', 'Technical', 'flaws', 'aside', 'really', 'plot', 'character', 'interaction', 'turned', 'film', 'wash', 'actors', 'Sandra', 'B', 'are', 'barely', 'utilized', 'terms', 'acting', 'potential', ""'ve"", 'also', 'decided', 'George', 'Clooney', 'really', 'just', 'failed', 'attempt', 'clone', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'presence', 'demeanor', 'more', 'often', 'drab', 'annoying', 'predictable', 'anything', 'else', ""'d"", 'rather', 'have', 'had', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'least', 'Nick', 'more', 'interesting', 'watch.It', 'Director', 'was', 'make', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'calm', 'quiet', 'nothingness', 'space', 'then', 'grew', 'bored', 'decided', 'wished', 'were', 'instead', 'making', 'space', 'monster', 'film', 'peril', 'dangers', 'attacking', 'crew', 'turn', 'Ergo', 'malignant', 'debris', 'field', 'raging', 'fire', 'etc', 'everything', 'can', 'find', 'out', 'get', 'save', 'spaceship', 'absurd', 'amount', 'action', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'character', 'interaction', 'were', 'least', 'halfway', 'decent', 'acting', ""n't"", 'problem', 'Director', 'terrible', 'direction', 'combined', 'mediocrely', 'written', 'screenplay', 'was', 'nothing', 'going', 'anyone', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'way', 'Twister', 'interpersonal', 'drama', 'kept', 'hooked', 'well', 'what', 'Twisters', 'alone', 'could', 'do', 'just', 'other', 'space', 'oriented', 'film', 'could', 'name', '.Even', 'soundtrack', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'trying', 'impress', 'audience', 'absolute', 'quiet', 'space', 'crescendoing', 'sound', 'expect', 'impinging', 'disaster', 'was', 'cool', 'first', 'time', 'reusing', 'film', 'turned', 'too-obvious', 'borderline', 'amateurish', 'gimmick.The', 'only', 'recent', 'space', 'drama', 'can', 'think', 'worse', 'Gravity', 'are', 'latest', 'Star', 'Trek', 'reboot', 'films', 'ever', 'had', 'snowball', 'chance', 'heck', 'capturing', 'vibe', 'spirit', 'what', 'made', 'TOS', 'great', 'review.Bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'good', 'rental', 'way', 'good', 'enough', 'justify', 'owning', 'full', 'retail']",N/A

So I'm always happy to see a greater emphasis on the science part of the equation.

The drama is considerably more compelling when it's in a world we know.Enough about science.  This movie is really a ride and it's a good one. The pace is relentless, with just a few short spots where you can catch your breath.  Sandra Bullock owns the role, and she's earned every accolade that's come her way.  My appreciation of her on-screen work was doubled when I watched the extensive making-of videos that come with the BluRay.  In most movies, the video extras aren't worth the bother.  With 'Gravity' the extras are really worth it.The sound is worth a mention of its own.  The 5.1 mix on the BluRay is first-rate.  But if the movie ever does another round in the theaters, it's worth a drive to hear the Atmos mix.  I'm lucky to be in an area that has a large Atmos theater, and I made a point to see 'Gravity' in the big room.  I've never had a film experience that was so exhausting.  I had no adrenaline left.

As for the story and the characters, I was still pretty much blown away, though I have a few minor problems.  Phaldut Sharma might have as well have just told us that he wouldn't be in the movie for very long as his lines did everything but spell that out in multiple languages.  I found George Clooney witty, amusing, and just plain fun to watch, but he came off more like an equal than the mission commander.  Sure, there was, like, one time where he asserted his authority, but that solo occasion was jarring in comparison to the rest of his performance.  In all his other scenes, he just seemed to be in charge because he happened to be the one who knew the most about space travel.  As for Sandra Bullock, I initially wasn't impressed with her and only continued watching because I knew that the film was only ninety-one minutes long.  She started out as a geek on her first space mission and there was nothing impressive or original there.  Then, she seemed to go from panicking and being unable to do anything to moping and feeling sorry for herself.  But I'm glad I stuck around, because in the last 45% of the movie, Sandra Bullock just...rocked!  While her performance wasn't bad throughout the beginning of the movie and just failed to truly impress me, I now know what director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n meant when he praised Bullock in his acceptance speech at the Academy Awards.  Even without the visual aspect, I very much enjoyed this film, though I do plan to watch it with someone sighted next time around.

Dr. Ryan Stone, played amazingly by Sandra Bullock, is on her first space shuttle mission. Accompanying her is veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) who is on his final space expedition. When a Russian missile strike hits a satellite, a storm of high speed debris causes a chain reaction, hitting the Explorer and detaching the two from their Space Shuttle. Alfonso Cuaron has created a deliberately anxiety producing, claustrophobic film, mimicking both the beauty and the absolute terror of space. In it's real time timeline, we watch with baited breath as Dr Stone must use her knowledge and wits in order to survive. It is so intense that it's actually stressful to watch. It's also terrifying. If you can imagine being hundreds of miles above land, desperately clinging for survival, you know what it's like to watch Gravity. It is no small feat to make such a literally big movie feel so tiny. With the entire Earth as a backdrop, and the vast, cold darkness of space surrounding it, it would have been easier for the film to feel wide open. Instead, it feels like you too are clinging for your last breath. You feel the desperation. You feel the urgency. You feel alone.

However, I was disappointed in some very basic areas.1) The story and script lacked realism. When you do a movie and spent a lot of money creating realistic looking zero gravity effects, you should also apply that same template to the dialogue and different aspects of how astronauts might react in the circumstances portrayed in the movie. I grew up watching and following many space missions, and I have ingrained in my head how astronauts talk. What we saw in this movie was very Hollywood. What we saw in Ron Howard's Apollo 13 movie, was vastly more realistic. I think it would have been possible to create a compelling drama and yet preserve the framework of how astronauts behave under unusual circumstances.2) Gravity effects were more along the lines of fantasy than science. So many of the scenes were aimed that producing a kind of acrobatic circus rather than being realistic.3) Glaring contradictions. At the very beginning of the movie, there is the statement that is no sound. Yet in many scenes, there is sound made by things happening in space. I can understand the parts where the astronauts are working with tools etc. and how vibration can be transferred from the surface of one's helmet into the atmosphere of a space suit. But when I saw rocket boosters producing a sound, I couldn't wait for the movie to end. Some of the best scenes in 2001: A Space Odyssey, to advantage of the soundlessness of space and the result was powerful.This is 2014, not 1968 (date 2001 was released).

My heart was in my mouth, I could feel my heart beating a mile a minute.The film directed by Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's is so incredibly exciting, that I could speak superlatives all night. And, for most of the film it got me. There were a few moments near the end that the un believability factor kicked in, but OK. I have not seen anything so visually stunning. The sight of George Clooney and Sandra Bullock floating haphazardly through space hitting objects and each other. George losing his tether and then separating, all of this seemed real.What seemed iffy to me is that Mission Specialist Ryan Stone had only 6 months of training before she went into space. It takes years and years of training, they missed the mark with that piece. However, off they are,something from another space vehicle went all wrong and debris in space was wrecking havoc. This is very believable. A woman with six months training going through all of the tactics and manning the ships, no, not realistic. This is a space thriller, and it works in most aspects. I am a very concrete kind of person, and so the unbelievable is a big deal to me.Sandra Bullock gave a bravura performance, and if the rest of the competition was not as good as it is, maybe an Academy Award would have been hers. George Clooney for the short amount of time he was there was credible. But, as has been said, he would prefer to float in space than hang around a woman his age. The special effects are spectacular, and deserves every award to come down the pike. See this film and eat this all up.

Why on earth is the acting considered so great? Clooney sounds like he's sleep walking through his entire performance. He's bland as hell and just seems to be doing this a little too understated. His acting is almost as if he's making fun of the whole thing. Like there's an inner smirk trying to get out at the audience in him. Bullock is fine, but she doesn't quite seem on the mark sometimes. There seem to be moments when the director should have used a better take. She's done better than this and her acting range in many of her films pretty much out-perform this performance. Most of those were not nominated for any Oscars nor where they outstanding enough to have been. Neither is this performance. The special effects are very good I will admit, but nothing particularly earth shattering, completely groundbreaking or astonishing. And the film is mostly special effects. In the past a film like Independence Day, which at the time had some of the most advanced special effects in cinema,  still was not nominated for Best Picture. Nor were many movies ever nominated based of effects alone. In fact people seem to generally and historically frown on films that are built around mostly effects and everything else seems secondary. Why now does this film earn so much praise?There is nothing here but some pretty good effects and some stale to acceptable acting. The script is simple as simple can be, and elementary on top of it. Why are some critics and some of the public calling this film a masterpiece? I simply do not get it. Thinking back on some of the classic sci-fi  or drama movies that take place in outer space or are about space out there like Alien, Star Wars (for that matter any of the Star Wars movies), Blade Runner, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Contact, Apollo 13, etc., this movie is not anywhere near as good as any of them. It really isn't.Movies are not what they used to be. Occasionally 2 or 3 good ones come along worth a genuine Oscar nod every year, and the quality of good films has bottomed out over the last 6 years or so. Movies win best picture Oscars now  that never would have been nominated 20 years ago. I go into movies with far less expectations than I once did, and still I found this movie a visually interesting treat, but other than that I found it just plain average and feel it is not some masterpiece unless films are masterpieces nowadays based on special effects alone. Was not very impressed and I don't see why this movie is nominated for 11 Oscars. I'm beginning to wonder if the studios aren't paying off the AMPAS members to get Oscar nominations or something. Read some of the other 1 and 2 star reviews, others seem to be wondering the same thing.Worth a look if you want an evening of some slightly better than your run of the mill sci-fi with some way better than average special effects. Other than that I'd skip it.",2,Fairly good visually.

Well, I have to tell you this movie is beyond thrilling. This film is a perfect combination of ""Matrix"" and ""Inception"" and will pump your adrenaline to a maximum level! ""Gravity"" is a life time experience that everyone must see! If you add to the mix that Sandra Bullock and George Clooney star in it as main characters, it just doesn't get better than that!Since this movie has so many genres, it's hard to tell its main one. This movie has adventure, comedy, sorrow, suspense, thrilling scenes, intense scary scenes and so much more! The main one out of all these fantastic genres is definitely suspense. You walk in feeling bored and tired and you walk out feeling like Ryan Stone in the movie. (Sandra Bullock)The thrilling adventure begins when a young medical engineer named Ryan Stone goes up in space to help with installations for the Hubble Telescope. It seems like a casual spacewalk, but when she gets stranded away from her ship, ""Explorer,"" she needs to get back to Earth by hitching a ride on a different station. If you want to find out how and if she and her co-worker,  Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) make it back to Earth alive, you have to watch the film.The movie has so much adventure and so many impressive and clear graphics, it's hard not to like it! You feel like you are right there, experiencing whatever the main characters experience. The acting is amazing and there is deep meaning behind it - what would you do, if you were alone in the deepest and darkest part of this entire universe, with nobody but yourself? What would your thoughts be? Would you be able to remain hopeful or just give up and let Space take you? The camera work is the best I've ever seen. Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, I give you standing ovation for directing this masterpiece.My favorite scene is when Ryan is stuck in a damaged escape pod with no fuel. She thinks she's stranded. Before she decides to give up and loose hope of returning to Earth, she starts to see Matt. Matt gets in when she does not have her helmet on and shows her that she can get back. As soon as his statement is over, he's gone. She hallucinated him but the plan worked!  It's a very interesting and important scene in the movie and that's why I like it.The movie is rated PG-13 and I honestly think it is appropriate for age 12 to 18. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and it is showing in theaters everywhere right now. I may be wrong, but I predict Oscar nominations for the cast and director of ""Gravity.""

You need the 3-D feature to fully appreciate the stunning visuals; and 3-D is not used as a gimmick here...with only two developed characters, the film relies heavily on the visuals of deep space. In a recent press conference, the director (and co-producer and writer) Alfonso Cuaron, was subjected to the usual inane questions from the press; one of which - especially idiotic - was a query about the difficulties of filming in deep space...&#9786; Cuaron is forging quite a reputation in filmdom, with the fine films, &#34;Children of Men&#34; and &#34;Prisoner of Azkaban&#34; (arguably the best of the Harry Potter films) in his resume. This is by far his best effort though; and I would expect to see this movie - as a minimum - nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. While 3-D is de riguer for the visuals, you do not need it to appreciate the commanding and masterful performance by Sandra Bullock. Bullock is such a fine comic actress that she does not often get serious roles like this...and it is a pity. When she does get them - like in &#34;Blindside&#34; - she has excelled; and I feel certain she will get at least a Best Actress nomination for this superb effort. Bullock plays a mission specialist on her first space mission; the other developed character is the mission commander, played by George Clooney, who also does a fine job. The film is also technically accurate for the most part, even receiving praise from space veterans and you will not have to suspend your belief system to appreciate the story as it is one that could conceivably happen. The sound editing is also another plus...I have nothing but praise for this effort and give it my highest recommendation.",5,"Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission.",1393545600,"02 28, 2014",2014,1748,"['was', 'just', 'absolutely', 'astounded', 'power', 'movie', 'need', '3-D', 'feature', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'stunning', 'visuals', '3-D', 'not', 'used', 'gimmick', 'here', 'only', 'two', 'developed', 'characters', 'film', 'heavily', 'visuals', 'deep', 'space', 'recent', 'press', 'conference', 'director', 'co-producer', 'writer', 'Alfonso', 'Cuaron', 'was', 'subjected', 'usual', 'inane', 'questions', 'press', 'one', 'especially', 'idiotic', 'was', 'query', 'difficulties', 'filming', 'deep', 'space', '9786', 'Cuaron', 'forging', 'quite', 'reputation', 'filmdom', 'fine', 'films', '34', 'Children', 'Men', '34', '34', 'Prisoner', 'Azkaban', '34', 'arguably', 'best', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'resume', 'far', 'best', 'effort', 'would', 'expect', 'see', 'movie', 'minimum', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', '3-D', 'de', 'riguer', 'visuals', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'appreciate', 'commanding', 'masterful', 'performance', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Bullock', 'such', 'fine', 'comic', 'actress', 'not', 'often', 'get', 'serious', 'roles', 'pity', 'When', 'get', '34', 'Blindside', '34', 'excelled', 'feel', 'certain', 'will', 'get', 'least', 'Best', 'Actress', 'nomination', 'superb', 'effort', 'Bullock', 'mission', 'specialist', 'first', 'space', 'mission', 'other', 'developed', 'character', 'mission', 'commander', 'played', 'George', 'Clooney', 'who', 'also', 'fine', 'job', 'film', 'also', 'technically', 'accurate', 'most', 'part', 'even', 'receiving', 'praise', 'space', 'veterans', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'suspend', 'belief', 'system', 'appreciate', 'story', 'one', 'could', 'conceivably', 'happen', 'sound', 'editing', 'also', 'have', 'nothing', 'praise', 'effort', 'give', 'highest', 'recommendation']",N/A

The graphics/special effects were out of this world :-)  I'm a big Sandra Bullock fan.She did an outstanding job in her portrayal of the stranded astronaut struggling for survival. I wish there had been more back story to the plot. The ending took me a bit to understand. There was a lot of symbolism. It was a huge struggle to get her balance and stand at the water's edge since she had been in space for a week and her muscles had suffered. Her struggle to gather herself up, paralleled the great effort of her decision to go on living, not to just survive, but to thrive. She had emotionally checked out after her daughter's death. Bullock's character had been lost on Earth in the grieving process of the loss of her daughter; and probably had only been able to deal with the grief by concentrating on her work. How ironic that she could bury herself in work, avoiding getting on with her life to the point that she left the planet on this mission where she faced imminent peril. However, she could not get away from the tipping point in her head. Both situations shared similar required determination. Her position in her grieving was metaphorically portrayed by the malfunctioning Soyuz station escape pod as she yelled and kicked in frustration at the stymied circuitry.. My favorite dialog in the movie was the pep talk Clooney's ghost gave her at her emotional crossroad moment -- It would be so easy to just shut down. Should she just end it all or should she keep trying to survive? She had defined her purpose for living by her role as parent. Her work appeared to be important; however prevented her from dealing with her changed life's purpose. At the very end, while she carefully put one foot in front of the other; I held my breath thinking, &#34;Oh mercy! Ok, she got through all that in space, then she almost drowned after splash down. Now she is going to get eaten by an alligator or giant snake&#34; Thankfully no creatures popped up from the shadows to harm her. She was all alone. She didn't know where she was.

From the moment the film came on, I was lost in space, my hands gripping the seat, and my heart hammering. The music was a beautiful counterpoint, emphasizing the key moments without overwhelming viewers.We saw the film in IMAX in an RPX environment--essentially, Regal charges extra for leather seats, widescreen and upgraded sound. It was worth the near double price of the ticket. ""Gravity"" is the best film I have seen in a long time.This is probably one of the most researched films in history and the hard work really paid off. ""Gravity"" took 4.5 years to make. Sandra Bullock said choreographing the zero gravity pushed her body to the utter limits.  While rehearsing, Bullock had contact with a real astronaut, Catherine ""Cady"" Coleman, who sent her texts from outer space to tell her various aspects of her job. When Coleman finally got to see the film, she said it was one of the best depictions of her work she'd ever seen.WARNING:  Some people have complained about dizziness and nausea from viewing the film.

1685917,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B00H83EUL2,Robert Badgley,"[2, 4]","Gravity(released Aug/13),stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney.With the unprecedented super hype and press push by both its stars,and it's endless comparison's to other past Sci-Fi films,in particular 2001:A Space Odyssey,you would have thought this was a film for the ages! Let's clear something up,shall we? Firstly,this film does not come anywhere close to the epic classic that was 2001,in plot nor style.Secondly,it is a simple and mundane film that I am sure looked impressive in 3D and on the big screen.An honest to goodness good picture however,especially one made in 3D, has to have some substance to it.It must strike a balance between a good and decent story and it's eye popping visuals.This one is just too long on S/FX ,coming up far too short on its delivery.It's a terrible waste of two good actors who mostly,it looks like,did their things in front of blue screens,hanging off wires.The story finds Clooney and Bullock as two astronauts outside a space shuttle orbiting the earth.Bullock is concentrating on getting a communications array up and going,while Clooney is playing cowboy by doing mini orbits in his space suit around the shuttle.Suddenly they receive a warning to abort the mission.It seems the Ruskies have shot down one of their own satellites and the subsequent debris has had a domino effect.It is slowly but surely taking out  the majority of other satellites orbiting the earth.Before they can re enter the space shuttle,huge debris hits them,destroying the shuttle and killing the rest of the crew.The only two left alive are Clooney and Bullock,after a hairy rescue of Bullock by Clooney.The two's only hope of survival is to reach the International Space Station,which has been abandoned due to the dangerous debris.Clooney gets a bead on it and they head for it.As they approach Clooney has no more propellant left in his suit to break with,and the two tumble over and around the station.When their tow line breaks it is Bullock that now rescues Clooney.Bullock has a tenuous hold on Clooney who tells  her to let him go lest they both perish.When she refuses,he unbuckles his line and puts himself adrift.Inside the space station all isn't good.After a while the station catches fire.Bullock escapes into the only life pod left,which cannot make it back to earth because of damage to the outside.Inside the capsule she fires it up,but cannot escape the station as it is tangled in its' already deployed chute,which in turn is tangled in the station.This forces her to do a space walk to untangle the lines.As she does this, more dangerous debris comes her way smashing the station to bits.Back inside the pod but free of the station, she drifts hopelessly.She manages to pick up a signal from an Eskimo on the ground,and they briefly talk as her craft flies far over his head,until she goes out of both their ranges.She then turns off her oxygen and prepares to die.In a dream she imagines Clooney is back aboard the pod.He tells her she must use the landing jets to get the craft to the Chinese space station and save herself.She wakes up and it gives her the strength to carry on and get herself to the station.The Chinese station has also been hit and its orbit has deteriorated so much it is falling downwards,already hitting the earth's atmosphere.She gets inside,manages to jettison away from the station and eventually lands in a lake back on good old terra firma.Not thinking ,she blows the hatch and the capsule starts filling with water.It sinks to the bottom and Bullock tries swimming upwards but the weight of her suit keeps her down.She gets out of it and finally surfaces,drifting to land.It takes her a bit to adjust, but in short order she is walking on her two feet.Fade to black.The film seems like the present but can't be, the reality is all shuttle missions have been scrubbed.After one gets over the panorama of the earth and their surroundings,you would think the film would pick up momentum and get some decent traction.But for me at least,it never even takes off.The director has not imbued these characters with anything that I can personally empathize with.As distant as they are from the ground,is the same way I feel about the film.It's cold and impersonal.As is the music that accompanies this picture,which detracts more than enhances.Clooney's smiling,devil may care character is just far too cool for school.When Bullock is trying to emote some fear,Clooney,either in off screen voice or in front of the camera, acts like her personal psychologist,telling her its all ok,and to calm herself. It just doesn't sit right.And you JUST knew at least one of them was going to make it back alive.I mean what kind of a film would it have been if they had both died......hmm,maybe better? Finally the film's biggest premise is just not,to me,believable.I couldn't swallow that the two were able to go &#34;station hopping&#34; as it were.Their shuttle gets destroyed,oh I know lets just go over to the ISS,which happens not to be too far away.When that goes chest up,ok let's just go to the Chinese Space station,right over there.It is far,far too convenient and totally unbelievable.Which further deep sixes this picture.Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.The DVD doesn't have the extras the Blue Ray has(that's the big boys pushing we the consumers in the direction(s)they want),it has only a short film.The film is part of the picture.It's the viewpoint of the Eskimo Bullock talks to.All in all a BIG disappointment.The film was NOT 1/10th of the hype they would have you believe it was.And it is certainly not a film you could watch over and over again.The characters have no life to them, and as a result there's just no deep feeling for any of what you watch.It's all too impersonal and far fetched for me.2- 2 1/2 stars.",2,"This isn't THE ""Gravity"" is it?",1393545600,"02 28, 2014",2014,5852,"['Gravity', 'released',

In fact it's a tour-de-force for Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron who proved with his 2006 masterpiece &#34;Children of Men&#34; that there are few directors alive who are on his level with commanding and moving the camera in intense action sequences.Virtually the entire film takes place in earth's orbital space, and it involves only two characters, an experienced astronaut (George Clooney) and a medical engineer (Sandra Bullock) on her first shuttle mission.  To say they get into trouble is the understatement of the year.  You might think I'm stretching things a bit, but after the final fadeout it leaves no doubt to me that the film is really about something beyond its simple plot.  I'm trying not to provide any spoilers, but I'll just say that I find the film actually becomes a socio-political metaphor for the progress of women from the fifties to the present as she fights for her life. This explains some of its sexist dialogue as well as its 'coda'.The film deservedly won seven Oscars including one for director Cuaron, but it also won an Oscar for cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki.  Lubezki had to photograph actors, sometimes spinning on wires, in 'light boxes' on an empty stage surrounded by LED lights mimicking both direct sunlight and reflected light from Earth.  It might be that the camera work on &#34;Gravity&#34; was way outside the mainstream of convention, but the effects of Lubezki working with Cuaron were dazzling.Even if you aren't usually into science-fiction films, this is a must-see for anyone who loves well-made movies.",5,A Great Movie Experience That Transcends its Genre,1394928000,"03 16, 2014",2014,1804,"['34', 'Gravity', '34', 'been', 'accused', 'experts', 'playing', 'loose', 'scientific', 'possibilities', 'smacks', 'nitpicking', 'such', 'unforgettable', 'piece', 'great', 'entertainment', 'especially', '3-D', 'will', 'leave', 'breathless', 'fact', 'tour-de-force', 'Mexican', 'director', 'Alfonso', 'Cuaron', 'who', 'proved', '2006', 'masterpiece', '34', 'Children', 'Men', '34', 'are', 'few', 'directors', 'alive', 'who', 'are', 'level', 'commanding', 'moving', 'camera', 'intense', 'action', 'sequences.Virtually', 'entire', 'film', 'place', 'earth', 'orbital', 'space', 'only', 'two', 'characters', 'experienced', 'astronaut', 'George', 'Clooney', 'medical', 'engineer', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'first', 'shuttle', 'mission', 'say', 'get', 'trouble', 'understatement', 'year', 'might', 'think', ""'m"", 'stretching', 'things', 'bit', 'final', 'fadeout', 'doubt', 'film', 'really', 'something', 'simple', 'plot', ""'m"", 'trying', 'not', 'provide', 'spoilers', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'find', 'film', 'actually', 'socio-political', 'metaphor', 'progress', 'women', 'fifties', 'present', 'life', 'sexist', 'dialogue', 'as', 'well', ""'coda'.The"", 'film', 'deservedly', 'won', 'seven', 'Oscars', 'including', 'one', 'director', 'Cuaron', 'also', 'won', 'Oscar', 'cinematographer', 'Emmanuel', 'Lubezki', 'Lubezki', 'had', 'photograph', 'actors', 'sometimes', 'spinning', 'wires', ""'light"", 'boxes', 'empty', 'stage', 'surrounded', 'LED', 'lights', 'mimicking', 'direct', 'sunlight', 'reflected', 'light', 'Earth', 'might', 'be', 'camera', 'work', '34', 'Gravity', '34', 'was', 'way', 'mainstream', 'convention', 'effects', 'Lubezki', 'working', 'Cuaron', 'were', 'dazzling.Even', 'are', ""n't"", 'usually', 'science-fiction', 'films', 'must-see', 'anyone', 'who', 'well-made', 'movies']",N/A

1685925,A3VO05LD5WSO9F,B00H83EUL2,Robert Hayes,"[0, 1]","2001 it is not, but GRAVITY is a tense and, at times, thrilling movie about survival that coasts on its stunning visuals while paying little attention to story and character. The plot is simple: two astronauts who are making modifications to the Hubble Space Telescope have to fight for their lives after debris from a Russian satellite starts to make its way towards them. The cast is quite small, and only Sandra Bullock and George Clooney have any screen time. Everyone else is just a voice on the intercom. George Clooney does his usual ladies' man routine, which he does quite well, and Sandra Bullock does a good job of a woman who never should have been allowed in space in the first place. That aside, they do an admirable job with the script they were given. Where the movie really excels is in the visual department. Alfonso Cuaron spent many years developing this concept and technology to make this movie, not unlike James Cameron did with Avatar, and it shows onscreen. These are some of the most impressive space effects that I've seen in a long time, although calling them ground-breaking might be giving it a little too much credit. The score is also worth mentioning, and helps to maintain the tension throughout the film. Still, I felt like the story was lacking enough, and the middle 45-50 minutes of the movie lags quite a bit. I have a feeling that I'd be looking at this movie differently had I saw it in theaters, but I didn't, so this is how I feel about it. The first half-hour, and the last 20 minutes were superb, but the middle dragged a little too much.

1685934,AHT60YWC3QIMI,B00H83EUL2,Robert Thorbury,"[4, 6]","I first heard about the movie Gravity from Phil Plait's ""Bad Astronomy"" website. He's a real stickler for scientifically accurate movies, and what he'd heard about Gravity had him very enthused early on.So, early in the morning on the day of release, I went down to the theater, caught the first non-IMAX 3D showing, and was blown away.Let's start with the opening visuals of Earth from orbit. Gorgeous. That alone was worth the ticket price. It gets better as the shuttle and its crew come into view.Once the accident occurs and the two surviving astronauts find themselves in a desperate situation, I was astounded by how realistic the physics felt. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, and in space things behave very differently from what we're used to here on the ground. The way the astronauts yo-yoed about on their tethers as they tried to grab onto each other or onto a nearby structure had my heart pounding.A common complaint from purists about space movies is the all-too-familiar sound of whooshing spaceships or the ear-splitting thuds as things explode. Not in Gravity. The only sounds heard in vacuum are those transmitted by the spacesuits. When things explode, the music is what heightens the drama.The two main characters were played by George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, and they do a fine job of acting, perfectly believable throughout the film. Enough said.As Phil Plait pointed out on his site, Gravity does stretch the science in a few places. In real life, it would be virtually impossible to get from the orbit of the Hubble Space Telescope to that of the International Space Station. That's why, during the final 2009 telescope servicing mission, they actually had a spare shuttle ready on the launching pad, just in case the astronauts needed rescue. But, obviously, there would be no movie if the producers insisted on this level of accuracy, so they fudged things a bit. No matter.As for the PG-13 rating, it's warranted. This is one VERY intense movie. Are you old enough to remember the first time you saw Jaws in the theater back in 1975? Remember the way everyone shrieked when that severed head popped out of the hole in the side of the boat? Well, there are a couple of comparable scenes in Gravity early on. No one shrieked, but it was definitely gruesome.There's also a bit of language, but nothing I can't imagine myself saying if I were suddenly cast adrift in a space accident.All in all, this one is well worth the seeing, and I'm glad I did.

1685945,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00H83EUL2,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 4]","****1/2""Gravity"" is that rare movie that, while a tour-de-force on a technical level, also happens to come with a great deal of its own - pardon the pun - gravitas.Sandra Bullock, in a bravura, near-one-woman performance, plays Dr. Ryan Stone, an astronaut on her first mission into outer space, sent there on Space Shuttle Explorer to perform some much-needed repairs on the Hubble Space Telescope. While she's space walking with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), the shuttle is hit by debris from a missile strike the Russians have launched to take out a non-operational satellite. Things go from bad to worse when the two astronauts are torn away from the now-destroyed shuttle and are cast out into deep space with little hope for a safe return to earth.Director Alfonso Cuaron has gathered together a team of technological wizards to replicate, as closely as is humanly possible, the experience of floating adrift in outer space: the weightlessness, the uncontrollable spinning (warning: take your Dramamine beforehand), the immense size and grandeur of Earth as seen from hundreds of miles above the surface.  The purely visceral nature of the movie goes a long way towards mitigating any qualms one might have as to the plausibility of every single thing it is showing us.The screenplay by Cuaron and his son Jonas does well within the admittedly restrictive parameters demanded by the narrative, which is why the performances of Bullock and Clooney ultimately play so crucial a role in the success of the movie. They make us care about the people to whom this is happening - and, without that, all the special effects in the world couldn't make this concept work.

The Sandra Bullock vehicle &#34;Gravity&#34; is surprisingly similar to Robert Redford's film &#34;All is Lost.&#34;  Both films feature a protagonist engaged in a crushingly lonely battle for survival against the elements... or in Bullock's case, against the vacuum of space.The first impression most viewers make is: &#34;The cinematography is excellent!&#34;  That's true; this film should be seen on a big screen, in Blu-Ray format.  An army of technicians really made each frame a feast for the eyes.  But every time I hear a viewer say &#34;It looks great!&#34; first, I suspect the &#34;Tin Man Syndrome:&#34;  It doesn't have a heart.No heart?  But it's dutifully weepy!  We are reminded that Bullock's character had a small child who died tragically.  A small, logical voice in the back of our head whispers:  &#34;Why would NASA send up someone with such profound psychological scars?&#34;  Moreover, it's a bit annoying that she's little more than payload, insofar as she has little knowledge of how anything works in her orbital habitat.The movie's pacing screeches to a halt at its midpoint too.  The film's Latin director has a long scene invoking allusions to the &#34;magical realism&#34; of many Latin American novels.  As in the novels, the protagonist carries on a rather matter-of-fact conversation with the dead.  It works in books, but it sucks the energy out of the film faster than the vacuum of space.I also suspect that I am not the only viewer who is disquieted by the graphic depiction of a destroyed space shuttle and crew.  We already have two true tragedies to reflect on, as well as the loss of national prestige in the abandonment of the entire program with no successor in sight.

Apparently to compensate for the lack of inherent feeling in the script, the movie is drenched in over-the-top music (which, after a while, grinds the viewer down). ""Here's where you should really feel engaged"" is what the most dynamic parts of the score seem to be screaming at us. The problem is, almost all of the music is too dynamic and overdriven. It's too much.No matter how stunning the whizz-bang effects are, they cannot (and certainly do not) draw the viewer in to the humanity and relatability of the characters.

The worlds of Star Trek and Star Wars are metaphors representing more grounded themes, and even Alien director Ridley Scott described his classic as a haunted house in space. Alfonso Cuaron&#8217;s Gravity, however, is a true space film, deriving its thrills and horrors from the fear of outer space itself.Gravity has certainly earned much of the praise it has earned. It is rich with dazzling visuals and often terrifying sequences, of Sandra Bullock&#8217;s Dr. Ryan Stone barely clinging on to survive. Its strengths, though, come awfully close to being Gravity's weakness - for nearly an hour we go through conflict-solution, conflict-solution. As thrilling as it is, this movie frequently becomes an exploitative experience.After the turmoil, though, what lasts is its more long-term storytelling methods. A sense of order is created through key missions (such as approaching the Chinese space station, using escape pods to leave for Earth, etc.), orienting the viewer through what is otherwise a dizzying adventure. This narrative clarity also spills over into the film&#8217;s themes of survival and determination, and holding to heart one vision in order to survive.This makes me question the re-watchability of this film; since so much of its meat is spent on these momentary thrills (however excellently crafted), there isn&#8217;t that much emotional punch to invite additional viewings.",4,Involving but somewhat exploitative space thriller,1405987200,"07 22, 2014",2014,1510,"['as', 'many', 'films', '8217', 'gotten', 'space', 'years', 'very', 'few', 'are', 'actually', 'space', 'worlds', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Star', 'Wars', 'are', 'metaphors', 'representing', 'more', 'grounded', 'themes', 'even', 'Alien', 'director', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'described', 'classic', 'haunted', 'house', 'space', 'Alfonso', 'Cuaron', '8217', 's', 'Gravity', 'however', 'true', 'space', 'film', 'deriving', 'thrills', 'horrors', 'fear', 'outer', 'space', 'itself.Gravity', 'certainly', 'earned', 'much', 'praise', 'earned', 'rich', 'dazzling', 'visuals', 'often', 'terrifying', 'sequences', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', '8217', 'Dr.', 'Ryan', 'Stone', 'barely', 'clinging', 'survive', 'strengths', 'though', 'come', 'awfully', 'close', 'being', 'Gravity', 'weakness', 'nearly', 'hour', 'go', 'conflict-solution', 'conflict-solution', 'thrilling', 'movie', 'frequently', 'exploitative', 'experience.After', 'turmoil', 'though', 'what', 'more', 'long-term', 'storytelling', 'methods', 'sense', 'order', 'created', 'key', 'missions', 'such', 'approaching', 'Chinese', 'space', 'station', 'using', 'escape', 'pods', 'leave', 'Earth', 'etc', 'orienting', 'viewer', 'what', 'otherwise', 'dizzying', 'adventure', 'narrative', 'clarity', 'also', 'over', 'film', '8217', 's', 'themes', 'survival', 'determination', 'holding', 'heart', 'one', 'vision', 'order', 'survive.This', 'question', 're-watchability', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'meat', 'spent', 'momentary', 'thrills', 'however', 'excellently', 'crafted', 'isn', '8217', 'much', 'emotional', 'punch', 'invite', 'additional', 'viewings']",N/A

Sandra Bulloch plays a scientist who is clueless in an outer space environment. In the opening scene alone there were so many unrealistic discrepancies that anyone with a even modicum of knowledge about a gravity free environment would be staring in dumb founded incredulity. Untethered tools and parts????? Give me a break. Obviously the producer/director thought we needed to be told that things which are not tied down in space tend to float away.What follows is no better. While the actual incident which results in the basis for the plot is impressive and certainly plausible, Bulloch surviving close call after close call is laughable. Her acting is fine and believable in the role. On the plus side, for you guys, she is in her skivvies more often than not. She's not my type personally. The only thing worth an extra star in my opinion would have been if Clooney had been in his, but this film was so lame even that would be a stretch.Two stars is for the special effects.

There are no aliens, unknown worlds, monsters, or laser shootouts. This is a movie that's set in the real world, or more accurately, above it.The story opens with a George Clooney voice-over. We meet astronauts working to repair a satellite. This shows how calm such a silent world can be. I reluctantly saw the movie in 3D, but this was one occasion that I came away feeling that it added to the experience. It almost made me dizzy seeing Ryan Stone (Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (Clooney) go about their routine business with Earth looming large in the background. Indeed, the cinematography was breathtaking throughout the 90 minutes.I don't want to give away too many details, but if you have seen the trailer or even looked at the poster, you'll know that this movie is far from being a calm ride. An accident sends debris racing toward the astronauts like some kind of deadly shrapnel. What follows is a story about the strength of the human spirit, and the will to survive against all odds. Remember that the word gravity has more than one meaning.While I enjoyed Sandra Bullock's performances in The Blind Side and Speed, I would hardly describe myself as a fan. However, I left the theater thinking that she carried the whole movie, and it's easily the most accomplished performance of her career.Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n directed Y Tu Mam&aacute; Tambi&eacute;n, Children of Men, and the best Harry Potter movie (Azkaban), but this is comfortably my favorite from his impressive portfolio. The story is lean, gripping, thoughtful, thrilling, scary, breathtaking, beautiful, and emotional, and feels perfectly paced at every point. He doesn't insult us by giving too much exposition, and that draws us deeper into the story. His use of extreme close-ups is another reason we are drawn to these characters. It's hard to avoid feeling that you are a part of the movie.As I watched, I thought of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Moon, Apollo 13, Cast Away, Alien, and a few other great movies. Cuar&oacute;n lets us see his characters thinking, and that's a good thing. Remember that astronauts are not selected because they are stupid or incapable of adapting in extreme situations. I'm always impressed when I see a movie which takes the trouble to show how people really think. It's not an easy thing to do well. This choice works perfectly and helps the whole story succeed because it's so believable.Although the visuals dazzled on a regular basis, my favorite shot in the whole movie was Sandra Bullock in the fetal position. It jumped out at me as being so appropriate for the scene, and it was a stroke of genius. You'll know what I mean when you see it. The opening titles remind us that there is no sound in space, just as Kubrick depicted almost 50 years ago.I admire this movie so much that I would happily watch it again tomorrow. It's a wild 90 minutes. I left the theater feeling as if it was an effort to be back in the real world. I was totally immersed in the story to the point of being almost unable to function when it was over. I'm glad I had a long walk back to the car so that I could catch my breath.There are so many reasons to see this movie, even if you hate science fiction. It won't be forgotten when the awards season arrives. See it immediately. I would even go as far to say you should see it in 3D.",5,One of the best sci-fi movies I have ever seen,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,3452,"['Many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'science', 'fiction', 'seriously', 'here', 'movie', 'might', 'work', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'genre', 'are', 'aliens', 'unknown', 'worlds', 'monsters', 'laser', 'shootouts', 'movie', 'set', 'real', 'world', 'more', 'accurately', 'it.The', 'story', 'George', 'Clooney', 'voice-over', 'meet', 'astronauts', 'working', 'repair', 'satellite', 'how', 'calm', 'such', 'silent', 'world', 'can', 'be', 'reluctantly', 'saw', 'movie', '3D', 'was', 'one', 'occasion', 'came', 'away', 'feeling', 'added', 'experience', 'almost', 'made', 'dizzy', 'seeing', 'Ryan', 'Stone', 'Bullock', 'Matt', 'Kowalski', 'Clooney', 'go', 'routine', 'business', 'Earth', 'looming', 'large', 'background', 'Indeed', 'cinematography', 'was', 'breathtaking', '90', 'minutes.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'many', 'details', 'have', 'seen', 'trailer', 'even', 'looked', 'poster', ""'ll"", 'know', 'movie', 'far', 'being', 'calm', 'ride', 'accident', 'debris', 'racing', 'astronauts', 'kind', 'deadly', 'shrapnel', 'What', 'story', 'strength', 'human', 'spirit', 'will', 'survive', 'odds', 'Remember', 'word', 'gravity', 'more', 'one', 'meaning.While', 'enjoyed', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'performances', 'Blind', 'Side', 'Speed', 'would', 'hardly', 'describe', 'fan', 'However', 'left', 'theater', 'thinking', 'carried', 'whole', 'movie', 'easily', 'most', 'accomplished', 'performance', 'career.Alfonso', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'directed', 'Y', 'Tu', 'Mam', 'aacute', 'Tambi', 'eacute', 'Children', 'Men', 'best', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movie', 'Azkaban', 'comfortably', 'favorite', 'impressive', 'portfolio', 'story', 'lean', 'gripping', 'thoughtful', 'thrilling', 'scary', 'breathtaking', 'beautiful', 'emotional', 'feels', 'perfectly', 'paced', 'point', ""n't"", 'insult', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'exposition', 'deeper', 'story', 'use', 'extreme', 'close-ups', 'reason', 'are', 'drawn', 'characters', 'hard', 'avoid', 'feeling', 'are', 'part', 'movie.As', 'watched', 'thought', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'Moon', 'Apollo', '13', 'Cast', 'Away', 'Alien', 'few', 'other', 'great', 'movies', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'see', 'characters', 'thinking', 'good', 'thing', 'Remember', 'astronauts', 'are', 'not', 'selected', 'are', 'stupid', 'incapable', 'adapting', 'extreme', 'situations', ""'m"", 'always', 'impressed', 'when', 'see', 'movie', 'trouble', 'show', 'how', 'people', 'really', 'think', 'not', 'easy', 'thing', 'do', 'well', 'choice', 'perfectly', 'whole', 'story', 'succeed', 'so', 'visuals', 'dazzled', 'regular', 'basis', 'favorite', 'shot', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'fetal', 'position', 'jumped', 'out', 'being', 'so', 'appropriate', 'scene', 'was', 'stroke', 'genius', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'see', 'opening', 'titles', 'remind', 'sound', 'space', 'just', 'Kubrick', 'depicted', 'almost', '50', 'years', 'ago.I', 'admire', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'would', 'happily', 'watch', 'again', 'tomorrow', 'wild', '90', 'minutes', 'left', 'theater', 'feeling', 'was', 'effort', 'be', 'back', 'real', 'world', 'was', 'totally', 'immersed', 'story', 'point', 'being', 'almost', 'unable', 'function', 'when', 'was', ""'m"", 'glad', 'had', 'long', 'walk', 'back', 'car', 'could', 'catch', 'breath.There', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'reasons', 'see', 'movie', 'even', 'hate', 'science', 'fiction', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'forgotten', 'when', 'awards', 'season', 'See', 'immediately', 'would', 'even', 'go', 'far', 'say', 'should', 'see', '3D']",N/A

I thought it could go in several directions, so I thought I would keep an open mind. From that trailer, you would likely come to several conclusions. First, you might think the movie was trying a bit too hard to be dramatic. You also might conclude that it would be a terrifying, graphic, horror story of a sci-fi. You also might conclude that it would have overblown acting and direction that tries too hard to be edgy (in addition to dramatic). And yet...you might also conclude that this film would be DIFFERENT from the sci-fi that has come before, and break new ground if it met it's seemly lofty ambitions. Well the film is out and it is nothing you feared and everything you might have hoped for and more.The Most Beautiful Realistic Science Fiction Yet FilmedThe film begins, and you are treated to the most astounding CGI/optical special effects yet seen for realistic astronaut work/spacewalk. A single, long, LONG shot allows the scene to unfold. The sheer beauty of the scene's visuals opens our eyes to how astoundingly beautiful the Earth must be from orbit. Throughout the film, if you have any appreciation at all for cinematography, visual effects, and just plain splendid film visuals in general you WILL be amazing. The way the opening sceene unfolds is more than that though. It's great film-making. The astronauts talk, Mission Control advises, the the astronauts go about their daily work. And then...all heck breaks loose.""What do I do? WHAT DO I DO!?!?""If you've watched ANY of the trailers for this film, you should know by now that it's a disaster movie...in SPACE. In a space of moments, events transpire that take everything from tranquil to terrifying. If you were to judge this film based on trailer alone though, you would miss something very important indeed.From a two minute snippet of a film like this you can see the build-up. You are acclimated to a situation, then the music, the visuals, the dialog, and perfect direction quickly make you feel the gravity of the situation. In zero gravity, object have momentum and inertia until they are acted up by an outside force. In plain-speak this means if something is moving 20,000 miles per hour and heading your way, it keeps rocketing at that speed until it slams into you with unimaginable force. Likewise, if something is moving only 50 miles per hour in zero-G it just keeps right on coming, and unless you have friction (thrust), you won't change velocity until that thing (again) slams right into you. When the only thing keeping you alive is a few centimeters of cloth and a tank of oxygen, that's absolutely terrifying, and the director makes you feel it, see it, hear it, and experience it with amazing realism.While mileage will of course vary, I am of the personal opinion that Sandra Bullock gives the performance of a lifetime and one that will define her entire career as the newbie astronaut Ryan, and George Clooney is splendid as the veteran astronaut Matt. They both come across as believable, and as I watched the film I felt very much taken along for the journey (thinking about just what I would do if I were in that situation).""I hate space!""Now, if you have ever seen a disaster movie in your life, you know that they are a series of unfortunately coincidences one after another that keep the protagonist on the edge of near-death (with some breaks in between now and then so you can catch your breath). This film does not stray too far from that formula, except perhaps that it is directed less like a disaster film (no interventions from unexpected sources to save the day, and the dangers are all environmental/psychological, so you won't have to worry about any psychopaths with knives, insane robots on the loose, etc).Some people have said that this film is completely predictable, and others have said it is completely original. The truth lies somewhere in between. I have often been very irritated that people continue to blast a film simply because it uses tropes (tropes are not bad), and embrace something that hasn't been very well-done simply because it isn't familiar to them. What I am trying to say is...this film is NOT original in the story it tells. We've had movies about survival against all-odds in a crisis situation for a long time. We've had a few decent films about real-world space travel as well. What we have NOT had, is a film THIS well-made about this story told in this AMAZING WAY.""Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission.""Some people have (justifiably) complained about scientific inaccuracies in this film. The objects of certain objects aren't correct, or are in the wrong direction. The likelihood of a debris field of a certain size being created as a result of an impact in space. A Payload Specialist being called a Mission Specialist. The fact that the main character does not act like an astronaut and acts more like you or I would... Yeah, some things bothered me too. If you know anything about NASA, a Mission Specialist trains like CRAZY. They don't let failures or people with obvious psychological issues on spaceflights (unless, again, they are just there to do one thing, in which case they aren't trained at all for spaceflight maneuvering [if any astronauts want to correct me my source is Wikipedia]). But after seeing the movie all the way through...none of that matters.For one thing, this film is just far enough off from the real world that I can call it's setting an alternate near-future Earth (Earth 2 if you will). In such a world, EVERYTHING that happens in the film is POSSIBLE. It's POSSIBLE that NASA runs out of money and skimps on training, but gives a bit of extra training for emergencies. It's POSSIBLE that orbits are adjusted for one reason or another. And yes, it's possible that collisions happen, create a catastrophic debris field, and a person has to fight to survive the cold vacuum of space. And that possibility is what makes this film so darn amazing.When you see objects moving, spinning, acting upon each other, it is all INCREDIBLY real. With a very small suspension of disbelief, you can swallow everything that happens and just go along for the ride, enjoying that under the exact circumstances of the film, everything would transpire exact as seen (or as a book on writing sci-fi that I once read said, you can setup whatever rules you want for your story, you just have to obey them).""Either way, it's going to be one hell of a ride.""This is one wild roller-coaster of a movie, and it uses EVERY trick at the director's disposal to make you take this amazing journey. You will taken inside of an astronaut's helmet and be able to read the indicators in their HUD, you will watch objects burn up into the atmosphere, you will be with an astronaut as they tumble and spin out of control, out of breath, terrified out of their mind. And the beautiful, compelling, thrilling reality of it all will take your breath away.There are moments in this film that will stick with you forever. On this journey you will follow an astronaut's psychological death and rebirth, spelled-out in visuals that will easily make this among the highest ranked science fiction masterpieces ever made. There is no sound in space (though there is in the trailer, it is not there in the movie). The only sound effects are what a person inside a suit or spaceship would hear. The music more than makes up for it. Listening to it will make your heart pound. There is no closet horror here, no zombie hordes or dinosaur jack-in-the-box that leaps into view, and it isn't needed. The thrill of an escalating situation in space is all the terror you need.But thankfully, this film is more thrilling than terrifying. You will feel stressed, but you will not feel drained. You will be taken to a low point, and then your spirit will sail up into the sky along with the protagonist. This film is NOT a downer. It will make you want to cheer.""It's time to stop driving. It's time to go home.""Within the story of survival there is another story. A story of a woman who has given up on life, and is just going through the motions, and now has to make a decision about whether or not she wants to live, whether it's worth the harrowing journey to SURVIVE and walk out the other side of the cold dark tunnel. Some people may think this story is cliche, or boring, or unnecessary. I think it's humanizing, compelling, and inspiring.I'll make a confession. I AM a Sandra Bullock fan. I fell in love with her as a teen in ""While You Were Sleeping"". I've followed her career since then, and for me at least, she has always made an otherwise unwatchable movie one that I could enjoy (not a fan of Miss Congeniality or The Blind Side, but I watched both movies for her). I've been waiting though, for the movie that I would love her in more than anything she has ever done (much like I'm still waiting for the movie Daniel Craig or Jennifer Lawrence will be in that is good enough for me to want to own for a reason other than that he's in it and I like him). Well, for me, THIS is that movie.Sandra Bullock is 49, but she has NEVER been in better form. She is gorgeous in this movie, a perfect representative for all women of humanity (I told you this was high-calibur sci-fi). She is at turns, normal, helpless, determined, angry, lost, strong, and at last, triumphantly spiritually transcendent. Ultimately, this is not a battle against the elements, but a battle against herself, and the conclusion is awe inspiring. The music, the visuals, and the actor combine to create scenes that are downright iconic, and the as I said, the end of this film will make you want to cheer.After seeing this film I could not stop thinking about. I cannot stop talking about it. When it comes out on Blu Ray I WILL buy it and treasure it forever. I had thought no film could be better than Oblivion this year, but this film IS BETTER (And here I thought for any film to be better than that one was impossible. Silly me.) Do yourself a favor. Go out to a theater immediately and see this film. Great, compelling, entertaining, glorious art like this deserves to be seen, appreciated, and celebrated.Oh, and it deserves to win Academy Awards for Best Actress, Best Director, Best Script, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Musical Score, and DEFINITELY Best Picture!",5,"A Science Fiction Thriller Masterpiece - A triumph of sight, sound, and the human spirit",1381968000,"10 17,

There was even a person who wrote a review saying the film was so unrealistic because, when Sandra Bullock stripped out of her spacesuit, she was not wearing a diaper.  To those people, I say get a life and stop looking to Hollywood for realism.  It is a fantasy world.  It does not need to be realistic.  It just has to entertain you.I, certainly, do not give this film one star for the reasons stated above.  Go read a book or go visit NASA if you want to learn about space.  I just thought the final product that I viewed was boring.  It definitely was not entertaining.  I'm glad this film was only an hour and a half in length.The special effects is the only decent characteristic about the film, but it is not enough to save this clunker.  My biggest issue is that, during most of the film, the viewer is hearing Bullock panting.  I could bet that there was more of her panting throughout the film than there was of her talking.  It seemed that pronounced.  She starts almost five minutes into the film and never stops.  It gets annoying after awhile.Let me preface my comments by saying that I think she is a good actress and I have liked many of her other films.

1686109,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B00H83EUL2,The People's Critic,"[5, 8]","Gravity director, Alphonso Cuar&oacute;n said that after this, he will never make another ""space"" movie.  Thankfully, the ""space"" movie that he did make is nothing short of spectacular, and should certainly make any director think twice before making the next ""space"" movie.Superlatives abound when describing the intensity and the mind-blowing visual effects of Gravity.  Set in space, Gravity opens with the words, ""Life in space is impossible,"" and five better words do not exist to serve as prologue for the film that follows.  Doctor Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) are on a NASA satellite repair mission 600 kilometers above Earth's surface when rogue debris from a Russian satellite detonation rip through their station at 50,000 MPH, decimating their ship and sending the astronauts hurdling into space.Cuar&oacute;n majestically dazzles the viewer in the opening scene with epic silence, sweeping camera movements, and sensory immersion that rivals that of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.  He magnifies the strangeness and utter complexity of being suspended in space as Stone and Kowalski are shown performing a variety of tasks as they complete their mission while communicating via radio between each other and their contact at Mission Control in Houston (Ed Harris).The peaceful, serene tone of the film's first ten minutes is mesmerizing but unsettling as a twinge of impending doom is resting uneasily in the audience's mind.  The thrilling contrast of the sudden catastrophe that befalls Stone and Kowalski is also handled with pure terror.  Tonal comparisons can be made to the 2003 film Open Water where primal fear is explored as two scuba divers are abandoned in the middle of the ocean hundreds of miles from shore.  Gravity taps into that same primal fear with expertise and style.Gravity is a true cinematic ride.  While not deep in content, the film is absorbing, terrifying, and authentic.  Clooney and Bullock carry the movie with ease and with a tight running time of 91 minutes, the small cast merely emphasizes the ironically claustrophobic nature of space.  Cuar&oacute;n's choices of point of view are magnificent as he allows the camera to effortlessly and seamlessly transition in and out of first-person at the most opportune times.  Few films give an audience such awareness and consciousness.  In once scene Bullock's character is suddenly sent spinning into deep space.  She loses radio communication and the camera assumes Bullock's point of view.  The audience abruptly is thrown into a very real experience of spinning, attempting to gain a point of reference, discovering oxygen levels are low, and likely literally holding their breath.  This is a movie to experience in a theater!  AGravity is rated PG-13 and has a running time of 1 hour and 31 minutes.  See it on the largest screen possible; it is playing in IMAX and XTreme theaters and can be seen in both 2D and 3D.  The People's Critic saw the film in 2D, but many critics say this is a film worthy of the 3D surcharge.",5,Primal Fear at its Best,1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,3069,"['Gravity', 'director', 'Alphonso', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'said', 'will', 'never', 'make', 'space', 'movie', 'Thankfully', 'space', 'movie', 'did', 'make', 'nothing', 'short', 'spectacular', 'should', 'certainly', 'make', 'director', 'think', 'twice', 'before', 'making', 'next', 'space', 'movie.Superlatives', 'abound', 'when', 'describing', 'intensity', 'mind-blowing', 'visual', 'effects', 'Gravity', 'Set', 'space', 'Gravity', 'words', 'Life', 'space', 'impossible', 'five', 'better', 'words', 'do', 'not', 'exist', 'serve', 'prologue', 'film', 'Doctor', 'Ryan', 'Stone', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'astronaut', 'Matt', 'Kowalski', 'George', 'Clooney', 'are', 'NASA', 'satellite', 'repair', 'mission', '600', 'kilometers', 'Earth', 'surface', 'when', 'rogue', 'debris', 'Russian', 'satellite', 'detonation', 'rip', 'station', '50,000', 'MPH', 'decimating', 'ship', 'sending', 'astronauts', 'hurdling', 'space.Cuar', 'oacute', 'majestically', 'viewer', 'opening', 'scene', 'epic', 'silence', 'sweeping', 'camera', 'movements', 'sensory', 'immersion', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'strangeness', 'utter', 'complexity', 'being', 'suspended', 'space', 'Stone', 'Kowalski', 'are', 'shown', 'performing', 'variety', 'tasks', 'complete', 'mission', 'communicating', 'radio', 'other', 'contact', 'Mission', 'Control', 'Houston', 'Ed', 'Harris', '.The', 'peaceful', 'serene', 'tone', 'film', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'mesmerizing', 'unsettling', 'twinge', 'impending', 'doom', 'resting', 'uneasily', 'audience', 'mind', 'thrilling', 'contrast', 'sudden', 'catastrophe', 'Stone', 'Kowalski', 'also', 'handled', 'pure', 'terror', 'Tonal', 'comparisons', 'can', 'be', 'made', '2003', 'film', 'Open', 'Water', 'where', 'primal', 'fear', 'explored', 'two', 'scuba', 'divers', 'are', 'abandoned', 'middle', 'ocean', 'hundreds', 'miles', 'shore', 'Gravity', 'same', 'primal', 'fear', 'expertise', 'style.Gravity', 'true', 'cinematic', 'ride', 'not', 'deep', 'content', 'film', 'absorbing', 'terrifying', 'authentic', 'Clooney', 'Bullock', 'carry', 'movie', 'ease', 'tight', 'running', 'time', '91', 'minutes', 'small', 'cast', 'merely', 'ironically', 'claustrophobic', 'nature', 'space', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'choices', 'point', 'view', 'are', 'magnificent', 'camera', 'effortlessly', 'seamlessly', 'transition', 'first-person', 'most', 'opportune', 'times', 'Few', 'films', 'give', 'audience', 'such', 'awareness', 'consciousness', 'once', 'scene', 'Bullock', 'character', 'suddenly', 'sent', 'spinning', 'deep', 'space', 'radio', 'communication', 'camera', 'Bullock', 'point', 'view', 'audience', 'abruptly', 'thrown', 'very', 'real', 'experience', 'spinning', 'attempting', 'gain', 'point', 'reference', 'discovering', 'oxygen', 'levels', 'are', 'low', 'likely', 'literally', 'holding', 'breath', 'movie', 'experience', 'theater', 'AGravity', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'running', 'time', '1', 'hour', '31', 'minutes', 'See', 'largest', 'screen', 'possible', 'playing', 'IMAX', 'XTreme', 'theaters', 'can', 'be', 'seen', '2D', '3D', 'People', 'Critic', 'saw', 'film', '2D', 'many', 'critics', 'say', 'film', 'worthy', '3D', 'surcharge']",N/A

However, story wise, this movie left a lot to be desired.  With all the attention this movie has received, I was expecting so much more.  This movie was only 90 minutes long(including credits), but given so much attention was given to the look of this film, I felt it would have been much better served to add a good 30 minutes to the film, and add a bit more depth to the story.We never really got to know any of the characters.  There was no back story as to who these character were, why they were in space, and the aftermath of the ordeal.  The story picks up with them already in space...and withing a few minutes, a major situation occurs that has characters fighting for survival...and the ending just felt like a cop out.  Honestly, I felt after watching this movie that I missed the first 30 minutes of the film, and the last 15 minutes of the film.  The beginning of the movie should have started on Earth, with introducing the actual characters, who they were, and the mission they were involved in.  It's hard to feel too much compassion for the situation the characters were in when you feel like you have no idea who the characters are.  And the ending of the film should have give us a satisfying conclusion to all the work it took to get home...instead of simply cutting it off when it did.I'll be honest with you, there was really no story at all in this movie.  I'm sure we could find some middle school kids to come up with a story with more depth than this film.  It seems that ALL the attention put into this film was for the look of the film.  I'll admit that it looked nice...but it takes more than good looks to make a good film.  And this film was seriously lacking anything of substance.

If NASA backed this vain attempt at reality (and it seems that they had some input with the space suits and ISS interior design) than I'm more disappointed in them than I am in the directors of this farce. Come on...anyone familiar with the Shuttle program knows that the Hubble Telescope and the ISS DO NOT fly in the same orbital plane and even if they did, they certainly wouldn't be only 100 miles apart. And if there WERE a Chinese Space Station, the same goes for it.Do we really think NASA would not only hire but send an astronaut like Sandra Bullock (I can't remember her name in the movie) on a mission like this? Her character is constantly frightened, has no idea where to go when the repair was aborted and apparently failed to fly the ISS/Soyuz escape pod simulator. These EVA's are so choreographed and so trained on that the actual event becomes almost second nature. There's just no way Bullock's character would be this shaky. Further, it's amazing how she seems to get into and out of the complex NASA EVA spacesuits with aplomb...a procedure that typically takes one or two others to administer for up to two hours. And, oh yes, although certainly nice to witness, the astronauts who left the Shuttle to perform EVAs didn't do so with extreme short-shorts underneath...they wore thermal undergarments but, I do admit, most if not all didn't look as good as Bullock does in this minimum attire.Do we really think that a Shuttle Commander (Clooney) would be allowed to fly around unabated with his jet pack, wasting fuel all the while engaged in useless chatter with Houston?And the worst...Bullock somehow undocks the Chinese escape spacecraft from the Station, targets re-entry and as the remainder of the craft is burning up, disengages the capsule in perfect re-entry attitude and deploys the drogue shutes all while attempting to read the craft's directions in Chinese!

While doing so, they get info from their space station Explorer, that a catastrophic stream of debris, which is a result of a Russian destroyed space shuttle is right on their way and ordered to abort their job. But before they do so, the debris hits the Explorer and the Telescope destroying both. Both the astronauts have a narrow escape and try to reach the nearest International Space Station (ISS) but find that the crew over there have already abandoned the ship sensing danger from the orbiting debris, which has already partly destroyed the same. Matt instructs Dr Ryan to use the capsule of ISS to reach the next nearest Chinese space station Tiangong and sacrifices his life to save Dr Ryan. She completely loses hope and plans to kill herself by shutting down the oxygen levels of the capsule but recoups herself thinking about the sacrifice of Matt. She somehow reaches Tiangong and propels herself to Earth through its functioning capsule just at the nick of moment before the orbiting debris once again devastates Tiangong. Dr Ryan&#8217;s capsule lands in a lake and she walks out on the full gravity of the Earth, a pleasure that she never thought of enjoying again.Positives: The movie watched in 3D gives a weightless feeling to the viewer throughout. The true experience of being lost in space and the difficult situations that astronauts face betting their lives is well established. The Director&#8217;s skill in screening the entire movie  with just two people and their struggle to get back to Earth alive, is commendable. Cinematography and the visual effects of living in space is excellent. Great background music.Negatives: Viewers might get disappointed when they don&#8217;t get to see any other character in the movie, and not as a great entertainer. The advanced technology could have maneuvered the shuttles out of the orbit of the 90 minute cycles of the debris and avoid impact.

1686136,A3LDFTSXU3UPBO,B00H83EUL2,Tim &#34;Timdiana&#34; Dunn,"[5, 8]","Every now and again, there comes a film that shakes things up. It is called ground breaking, monumental and the film that everyone should see. So what  film has the privilege of gaining such praise? Why that would be Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity. The man behind films like Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban and Children of Men not only helms Gravity, but he also produced and co-wrote this space thriller. When the movie made its way to Festival circuits, viewers were awed. For months now, Gravity has had nothing but praised from the likes of critics and filmmakers. That kind of one sided critiquing is something that catches my eye. So was Gravity truly a masterpiece? Masterpiece may not be the best term for this film; but more or less.The story of Gravity is quite simple. If you have seen the trailers or tv spots, then that's all you need to know about the plot. However, if you missed any of the film's advertisement, allow me to indulge you:  Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) finds herself in a heap of trouble after an accident above Earth's orbit leaves her stranded in space.With no build up, Gravity throws you right into the thick of things. In the first ten minutes, the satellite is destroyed and Sandra Bullock finds herself adrift in space. Normally, I would be bothered by such a thing; but in case of Gravity, it works. While I believe there are some themes in the film, they are used with a subtly and don't play a major role in the overall plot. When it comes down to it,  Gravity has a thrilling story from start to finish; and it certainly works in the film's favor.It's never easy to carry the stage by yourself, but Sandra Bullock showed that she can in this thriller. While this technically a two-man show, the perspective is center on Bullock's character and she does all the work. If Sandra is not at least nominated for Best Actress for the upcoming Oscars, I will be surprised. Why? Well it is one thing to play a strong character; it is another to play a strong character in a different environment, and that is exactly what Sandra Bullock does.  Don't worry, I'm not leaving out George Clooney. While I'm not biggest Clooney fan and I felt that George was being George, his role as Matt Kowalski was great for a supporting character. Still, at the end of the day, I have to take my hat off to Sandra Bullock.There is no other way to put this: Gravity has to be one the most technically sound films I have ever seen. Cuaron's use of camerawork was awe inspiring. Where we are so use to a clip to clip format in movies, Gravity used longer cuts and showed so much in each sequence. The first person shots were used so well, it could make a some First Person Shooters jealous. There was some Questionable CG, but it didn't hurt the overall film. What certainly help the film were the visuals. Gravity had some of the best shots of Earth I have ever seen captured on the silver screen.Then there is the film's 3D. Alright, I will be the first to admit that I'm not the biggest fan of 3D. If you can, i suggest seeing a movie in your standard 2D.  However, Gravity has my stamp of approval of being a must see  in 3D. The film used the effect to best of its abilites; from having things fly in your face to just seeing things stand out.  Gravity's 3D is worth every penny.If I had to pick which scene was my favorite, it would have to be the destruction of the space station. The sequence was thrilling and the both the camera and the 3D made the destruction of the ISS that more impressive. The only scene I thought was weak was when Ryan is speaking to the farmer.

1686166,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00H83EUL2,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's latest work ""Gravity"" is about two astronauts lost in outer space. The simple premise is not only intriguing but plausible, and it is also very ambitious as the film virtually features only two characters. (It's three if you include the voice of ground control by Ed Harris, a nod to Ron Howard's ""Apollo 13."")Having lost their space shuttle, two astronauts - Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Lieutenant Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) - have to figure out how to come back to the earth alive, while floating in the outer space. For Dr. Stone, who is a medical engineer, this is her first mission in space, which makes the situation even more difficult.The storyline, especially its second half, is admittedly less convincing than the brilliant first part (the script written by Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n and his son Jon&aacute;s Cuar&oacute;n), but ""Gravity"" remains a thrilling ride throughout thanks to the stunning visuals and strong acting from Sandra Bullock.Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n focuses more on the characters and the zero-G environment that is harsh to them, than the action sequences involving spaceships.

1686167,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00H83EUL2,Turfseer,"[7, 11]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Very few American films today classified as 'entertainment', actually can rise to the level of Art. 'Gravity', the new sci-fi, 'Space Odyssey-like' thriller, starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, I'm happy to report, has made it into that pantheon. You would never imagine that a film that only features two actors, can be so compelling and captivating; but coupled with a barrage of extraordinary digital effects, co-writer and director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, has pulled it off!The story begins with Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock), a bio-medical engineer and veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (Clooney), on a spacewalk outside their space shuttle, conducting routine experiments, when they're alerted by Mission Control in Houston that a Russian satellite has exploded and the debris field is headed straight for the shuttle (inciting incident). In a spectacular sequence, the shuttle is destroyed and Stone is hurled around in space still tethered to the craft, bouncing on and off of it, like a ping pong ball. When she's finally separated from the craft, Kowalski, utilizing his thruster pack to maneuver, saves her from floating out into space and they make their way back to the space shuttle, which they discover has been destroyed and the rest of the crew members dead (one of the astronauts who had been outside the craft, has his face blown off).As we break into Act II, Stone and Kowalski must make their way to the International Space Station (ISS), if they have any chance of survival. The 'ticking time clock', so inimical to thrillers, is used to great effect throughout the film. Kowalski sets his watch for 90 minutes, because that's when the debris field, will make its first orbit around the earth, and come back and possible hit them again. While floating toward the ISS, we learn of Stone's back story (her daughter was tragically killed in a schoolyard accident and she then decided to devote her life to her work). Using the thruster, Stone and Kowalski arrive at the ISS, only to find the stakes are raised again, as the ISS crew has abandoned ship and the Russian Soyuz space module has been damaged, useless for re-entry to earth. Even more thrilling and shattering is that Stone finds herself tangled in the already deployed parachute from the module and is holding on to Kowalski, whose weight is causing the parachute cords to break.Suffice it to say, 'Gravity' avoids Hollywood endings by realistically arguing that space exploration is a danger business--and may result in death. Stone finds herself alone after Kowalski 'cuts himself loose' and we approach the 'dark moment' of the second Act, as Stone must maneuver the damaged module to a Chinese space station, Tiangong. But when she discovers that the module has no more fuel, it appears there's no hope. Stone's hopelessness is highlighted when she reaches a farmer on a short wave frequency, who doesn't speak English. The dark moment of the second act, always results in the protagonist discovering a solution to the problem; that happens during her hallucination that Kowalski has returned to help her, advising that she can still use the re-entry rockets to move the craft.Now the protagonist must implement the 'solution' as we head toward the climax in Act III. There's more spectacular, edge of your seat machinations, when Stone uses a fire extinguisher as a makeshift thruster, to get herself over and into the Tiangong. I won't go into the rest of it, except to say that Stone must not only get herself out of a real pickle during the fiery re-entry to earth, but must solve a new crisis, after splashing down into a body of water, in a remote section on earth.While I've been hard on Sandra Bullock, especially for her recent lame performance in 'The Heat', here she proves (when given the right material) that she's as good as any of the top stars out there today. It's an extraordinarily nuanced, low key performance, coupled with some physically demanding stunts, which I suspect were not all dependent on digital effects. Do you hear 'Oscar' calling? Clooney too is masterful, as he also delivers just the right kind of restrained performance to make this whole thing believable.Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n has admitted that not everything we see on screen is physically or scientifically possible. But so what! Much of the technical aspect is true to form and looks quite believable. 'Gravity' is much more than a spectacular visual feast--it's about a struggle against overwhelming odds. When Bullock (Stone) emerges from a watery tomb, after 'going it alone', a la 'Robinson Crusoe', there is the sense that we've just witnessed an awe-inspiring, story of survival and an uplifting paean, to the human spirit.",5,A Space Odyssey meets Robinson Crusoe in this new American sci-fi thriller classic,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,4746,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Very', 'few', 'American', 'films', 'today', 'classified', ""'entertainment"", 'actually', 'can', 'rise', 'level', 'Art', ""'Gravity"", 'new', 'sci-fi', 'Odyssey-like', 'thriller', 'starring', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'George', 'Clooney', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', 'made', 'pantheon', 'would', 'never', 'imagine', 'film', 'only', 'two', 'actors', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'compelling', 'captivating', 'coupled', 'barrage', 'extraordinary', 'digital', 'effects', 'co-writer', 'director', 'Alfonso', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'pulled', 'off', 'story', 'Dr.', 'Ryan', 'Stone', 'Bullock', 'bio-medical', 'engineer', 'veteran', 'astronaut', 'Matt', 'Kowalski', 'Clooney', 'spacewalk', 'space', 'shuttle', 'conducting', 'routine', 'experiments', 'when', ""'re"", 'alerted', 'Mission', 'Control', 'Houston', 'Russian', 'satellite', 'exploded', 'debris', 'field', 'headed', 'straight', 'shuttle', 'inciting', 'incident', 'spectacular', 'sequence', 'shuttle', 'destroyed', 'Stone', 'hurled', 'space', 'still', 'tethered', 'craft', 'bouncing', 'ping', 'pong', 'ball', 'When', 'finally', 'separated', 'craft', 'Kowalski', 'utilizing', 'thruster', 'pack', 'maneuver', 'floating', 'out', 'space', 'make', 'way', 'back', 'space', 'shuttle', 'discover', 'been', 'destroyed', 'rest', 'crew', 'members', 'dead', 'one', 'astronauts', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'craft', 'face', 'off', 'break', 'Act', 'II', 'Stone', 'Kowalski', 'must', 'make', 'way', 'International', 'Space', 'Station', 'ISS', 'have', 'chance', 'survival', ""'ticking"", 'time', 'clock', 'so', 'inimical', 'thrillers', 'used', 'great', 'effect', 'film', 'Kowalski', 'watch', '90', 'minutes', 'when', 'debris', 'field', 'will', 'make', 'first', 'orbit', 'earth', 'come', 'back', 'possible', 'hit', 'again', 'floating', 'ISS', 'learn', 'Stone', 'back', 'story', 'daughter', 'was', 'tragically', 'killed', 'schoolyard', 'accident', 'then', 'decided', 'devote', 'life', 'work', 'Using', 'thruster', 'Stone', 'Kowalski', 'arrive', 'ISS', 'only', 'find', 'stakes', 'are', 'raised', 'again', 'ISS', 'crew', 'abandoned', 'ship', 'Russian', 'Soyuz', 'space', 'module', 'been', 'damaged', 'useless', 're-entry', 'earth', 'Even', 'more', 'thrilling', 'shattering', 'Stone', 'tangled', 'already', 'deployed', 'parachute', 'module', 'holding', 'Kowalski', 'weight', 'causing', 'parachute', 'cords', 'break.Suffice', 'say', ""'Gravity"", 'avoids', 'Hollywood', 'endings', 'realistically', 'arguing', 'space', 'exploration', 'danger', 'business', 'may', 'result', 'death', 'Stone', 'alone', 'Kowalski', 'loose', 'approach', ""'dark"", 'moment', 'second', 'Act', 'Stone', 'must', 'maneuver', 'damaged', 'module', 'Chinese', 'space', 'station', 'Tiangong', 'when', 'module', 'more', 'fuel', 'hope', 'Stone', 'hopelessness', 'highlighted', 'when', 'farmer', 'short', 'wave', 'frequency', 'who', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English', 'dark', 'moment', 'second', 'act', 'always', 'results', 'protagonist', 'discovering', 'solution', 'problem', 'hallucination', 'Kowalski', 'returned', 'help', 'advising', 'can', 'still', 'use', 're-entry', 'rockets', 'move', 'craft.Now', 'protagonist', 'must', 'implement', ""'solution"", 'head', 'climax', 'Act', 'III', 'more', 'spectacular', 'edge', 'seat', 'machinations', 'when', 'Stone', 'fire', 'extinguisher', 'makeshift', 'thruster', 'get', 'Tiangong', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'rest', 'say', 'Stone', 'must', 'not', 'only', 'get', 'real', 'pickle', 'fiery', 're-entry', 'earth', 'must', 'solve', 'new', 'crisis', 'splashing', 'down', 'body', 'water', 'remote', 'section', 'earth.While', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hard', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'especially', 'recent', 'lame', 'performance', ""'The"", 'Heat', 'here', 'when', 'given', 'right', 'material', 'as', 'good', 'top', 'stars', 'there', 'today', 'extraordinarily', 'nuanced', 'low', 'key', 'performance', 'coupled', 'physically', 'demanding', 'stunts', 'suspect', 'were', 'not', 'dependent', 'digital', 'effects', 'Do', 'hear', 'calling', 'Clooney', 'too', 'masterful', 'also', 'just', 'right', 'kind', 'restrained', 'performance', 'make', 'whole', 'thing', 'believable.Alfonso', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'admitted', 'not', 'everything', 'see', 'screen', 'physically', 'scientifically', 'possible', 'so', 'what', 'Much', 'technical', 'aspect', 'true', 'form', 'quite', 'believable', ""'Gravity"", 'much', 'more', 'spectacular', 'visual', 'feast', 'struggle', 'overwhelming', 'odds', 'When', 'Bullock', 'Stone', 'watery', 'tomb', ""'going"", 'alone', 'la', ""'Robinson"", 'Crusoe', 'sense', ""'ve"", 'just', 'witnessed', 'awe-inspiring', 'story', 'survival', 'uplifting', 'paean', 'human', 'spirit']",N/A

It is suspenseful, frightening, touching, and an emotional powerhouse all wrapped into 90 minutes.  I really don't want to spoil the plot.  All you really need to know is that it's about people lost in space, but surviving space isn't what this movie's really about.  It's about life and it is beautiful.I'm not a Sandra Bullock fan, but I thought her performance here was top-notch.  I felt attached to her character from start to finish.  George Clooney, while essentially just playing George Clooney, does a great job as the veteran astronaut who talks her through things, but as far as acting is concerned this is Bullock's movie, no question about it.The visuals here are just incredible.  Not since Kubrick's 2001 has space seemed so beautiful yet terrifyingly deadly.  This movie knows how to capture the beauty and horror of the situations faced by its characters and does it with extraordinary style.  There are long stretches of silence, emphasizing the vacuum of space (as Kubrick did in 2001), but often the movie's best visuals are complimented by an outstanding score by composer Steven Price.As for 3D: This is honestly the only time I've ever felt a movie needed to be seen in 3D.  I have been against 3D ever since James Cameron started this recent trend with 'Avatar', but I'm telling you now: If you can see this movie in 3D don't miss it!  3D feels like it actually enhances the atmosphere and emotions of this film in ways I don't think any other 3D film to date has.  As a whole I'm still against 3D films, but Gravity has shown me that there is a place for 3D movies.Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n ('Children of Men', 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban') has delivered a modern masterpiece.  It is worth seeing in theaters (especially IMAX 3D, as I did) and I feel that when it's on Blu-Ray I'll be analyzing its themes, and visuals for years to come.  Most importantly: I felt genuinely moved by this motion picture.  The scares, the tension, and the emotionally charged climax- it all just rang true for me as a viewer.

1686194,AY3FXAAUZ0CYV,B00H83EUL2,WC Alaska,"[0, 0]","Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a brilliant medical engineer on a mission with seasoned veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney). Ryan is installing new scientific equipment to the space station when the team gets an order from Houston (Ed Harris) to immediately evacuate the mission and board the space station. It seems that Russia blew up one of its own satellites in orbit, causing thousands of large metal debris to start spinning into descent towards earth. However, the debris will pass by the astronauts every 90 minutes, a space storm of metal shrapnel coming at them thousands of miles per hour, adding to the tension of an already horrific situation they face.Kowalski, a self-assured, and humorous vet of many hours of space time, instantly orders Stone to stop what she's doing and enter the space lab for protection. Stone, intent on finishing her mission, delays a minute too long, and the debris starts shooting by, tearing up everything in its path.  The space station is smashed and Stone and Kowalski are knocked loose of the craft and their only form of stability.Suddenly Stone finds herself drifting away from the safety of the space station, spinning, spinning, in nothingness. Kowalski keeps talking to her--calming her down, and keeping her talking so he can locate her. Finally she slows down enough that she's able to flash her flashlight and Kowalski sees her, using his thrust jet pack to maneuver over to her, then tethering together so they can go off to search for a safe craft to take them back to earth.Thus begins the long journey of Dr. Stone. Yes, this is about a strong character stuck in space where the odds are against her, but it's much more. It's about the strength of spirit and the sheer terror one can face when facing the unknown. The story reveals pieces of her life that affect her to this fateful day, and it shares her pains and memories. There is much more behind the story and some pretty strong symbolism of the underlying message of this film if you watch carefully.As always, Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are at their best--seasoned professionals, and their personalities click together on the screen. Ed Harris is the voice of Houston, calming, concerned, and trying to help when possible.The photography and CGI are so realistic I found it hard to believe that I wasn't watching an actual space walk. I'm not one for CGI, I think the majority of it looks like a video game, but the producers and software engineers behind this one worked magic to my eyes. They made everything look so real, the Earth so large, and the expansions of distance so long. My wife and I saw this first on the big screen, then on our own home set. Even on a smaller 42"" screen it was exciting.If you rent the DVD, take the effort to watch the included extras, they are, combined, about an hour long, and there is much explanation on how the story came to be, how it was created, and even a featurette about Aningaaq, an Inuit in Greenland that talked to Dr. Stone while she floated through space in a capsule.I highly recommend this movie, I hope you find it as enjoyable as we did.",5,"Sandra and George at their usual excellence, brilliant effects and moving storyline.

1686222,A2B047DQ8FHNL3,B00H83EUL2,Writer728,"[0, 0]","I wasn't sure what to expect with this film; the trailer initially gave me the impression of a space-based terror film.  But I decided to watch it and see for myself.  I was delighted to discover that the filmmaker kept to the real-life reality that sound cannot carry in the vacuum of space.  Although there is never anything routine about working in space, you can be on a &#34;standard&#34; EVA working a given problem and have no clue about what may be happening behind you, except for what you might be able to feel by touch or listen to by radio.Sandra Bullock gave a great performance, carrying the viewer across a spectrum from shock to fear to hope, with moments of humor that seem so uniquely her own (I won't give away the scene in question; and though her mannerism in that moment struck me as a little out of place for a trained astronaut, I nonetheless found it both charming and delightfully funny).  I suppose, after the experiences up to that point, one might argue that humor is sometimes a great antidote to fear.  Related to this is one memorable line I just have to share: during a very time-critical moment she attempts to initiate a particular sequence and the unexpected result evinces a goofy yet delightful &#34;okay, that doesn't sound good&#34; - or words to that effect.I liked the professionalism of George Clooney's character.  I found his calm composure under severe pressure both believable and appropriate.  However, there are way too many scenes in which this professional and calm demeanor are demonstrated to justify his language when he realizes the extent of the damage to the shuttle.  I could not accept nor believe that after so many other far-more harrowing and terrifying events in which he never resorted to foul language, that, upon seeing the shuttle he should suddenly take Our Lord's name in vain.  Had it been crafted as a prayer, that would be one thing, but I found his verbal reaction at the scope of damage to be out-of-step with the rest of his calm composure.  In fact, his equally goofy bantering in the earlier part of the show should have more accurately resulted in a more lighthearted response, such as, &#34;well, doesn't look like we're going home that way.&#34;  Such a statement as that would have been more attuned to his lighthearted mannerism earlier in the film, which I thought very appropriate, and also designed to help his colleague keep her cool under catastrophic conditions.Overall, a great film, good tension, good suspense, good use of technology; not at all the terror film I thought it was at first, so a delightful surprise there.  I like the film except for that tiny verbal abuse of Our Lord's name.  But tiny though it be, it is nonetheless an offense against God that wasn't at all necessary.  I would hope the producers release a special edition with that unnecessary comment edited out and replaced by something more in keeping with Clooney's otherwise calm and collected composure.  I think his encounter with the disabled shuttle far less horrific than all the preceded that scene.  I've heard it said by such trained professionals, that when things go south, you don't have time for emotional outbursts; your training kicks in and you work the problem or you don't come home.",4,"Exciting, Suspenseful, Great Effects and Almost Believable",1401235200,"05 28, 2014",2014,3265,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'film', 'trailer', 'initially', 'gave', 'impression', 'space-based', 'terror', 'film', 'decided', 'watch', 'see', 'was', 'delighted', 'discover', 'filmmaker', 'kept', 'real-life', 'reality', 'sound', 'can', 'not', 'carry', 'vacuum', 'space', 'never', 'anything', 'routine', 'working', 'space', 'can', 'be', '34', 'standard', '34', 'EVA', 'working', 'given', 'problem', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'happening', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'feel', 'touch', 'listen', 'radio.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'gave', 'great', 'performance', 'carrying', 'viewer', 'spectrum', 'shock', 'fear', 'hope', 'moments', 'humor', 'seem', 'so', 'uniquely', 'own', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'scene', 'question', 'mannerism', 'moment', 'struck', 'little', 'place', 'trained', 'astronaut', 'nonetheless', 'found', 'charming', 'delightfully', 'funny', 'suppose', 'experiences', 'up', 'point', 'one', 'might', 'argue', 'humor', 'sometimes', 'great', 'antidote', 'fear', 'Related', 'one', 'memorable', 'line', 'just', 'have', 'share', 'very', 'time-critical', 'moment', 'initiate', 'particular', 'sequence', 'unexpected', 'result', 'goofy', 'yet', 'delightful', '34', 'okay', ""n't"", 'sound', 'good', '34', 'words', 'effect.I', 'liked', 'professionalism', 'George', 'Clooney', 'character', 'found', 'calm', 'composure', 'severe', 'pressure', 'believable', 'appropriate', 'However', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'professional', 'calm', 'demeanor', 'are', 'demonstrated', 'justify', 'language', 'when', 'extent', 'damage', 'shuttle', 'could', 'not', 'accept', 'believe', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'far-more', 'harrowing', 'terrifying', 'events', 'never', 'resorted', 'foul', 'language', 'seeing', 'shuttle', 'should', 'suddenly', 'take', 'Lord', 'name', 'vain', 'Had', 'been', 'crafted', 'prayer', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'thing', 'found', 'verbal', 'reaction', 'scope', 'damage', 'be', 'out-of-step', 'rest', 'calm', 'composure', 'fact', 'equally', 'goofy', 'bantering', 'earlier', 'part', 'show', 'should', 'have', 'more', 'accurately', 'resulted', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'response', 'such', '34', 'well', ""n't"", 'look', ""'re"", 'going', 'home', 'way.', '34', 'statement', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'attuned', 'lighthearted', 'mannerism', 'earlier', 'film', 'thought', 'very', 'appropriate', 'also', 'designed', 'help', 'colleague', 'keep', 'cool', 'catastrophic', 'conditions.Overall', 'great', 'film', 'good', 'tension', 'good', 'suspense', 'good', 'use', 'technology', 'not', 'terror', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'first', 'so', 'delightful', 'surprise', 'there', 'film', 'tiny', 'verbal', 'abuse', 'Lord', 'name', 'tiny', 'be', 'nonetheless', 'offense', 'God', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'would', 'hope', 'producers', 'release', 'special', 'edition', 'unnecessary', 'comment', 'edited', 'replaced', 'something', 'more', 'keeping', 'Clooney', 'otherwise', 'calm', 'collected', 'composure', 'think', 'encounter', 'disabled', 'shuttle', 'far', 'less', 'horrific', 'preceded', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'said', 'such', 'trained', 'professionals', 'when', 'things', 'go', 'south', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'emotional', 'outbursts', 'training', 'kicks', 'work', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'home']",N/A
