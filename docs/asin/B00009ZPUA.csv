Vin Diesel has proven that he is solely an action movie hero.  If he attempts to stray from that formula, it will not be a convincing acting performance.  The movie had entertaining portions to it, but overall I would say that the movie did not do it for me.  When I see a movie I would like to feel something.  I want to become attached to the characters and see them either struggle or succeed.  This movie spent way to much time have shots of Vin Diesel staring into space for an action movie and too much action for a movie trying to tackle an emotional man's attempt to deal with his wife's death.

760292,A1YC9XEDFKXPLK,B00009ZPUA,Armando M. Mesa,"[1, 1]","Despite the mixed critiques, luke warm reviews, A Man Apart ain't all that bad...Diesel is still in his early stage of his acting career so there is much room for improvement...You still have to give the man an A for effort at least. But, soon he will definitely need something to really prove that he can play other well rounded or multi-faceted in-depth roles to avoid being stereo type casted or stuck as the tougher than tough and take no bs guy for the rest of his career.There's only so many limited &quot;don't f with me, man&quot; expressions viewers can take.Otherwise, it will just be Vin Diesel, well, playing Vin Diesel...What the film may also lack in story depth it makes up for in it's quick and fast paced action. The thrilling twist did keep me as a viewer interested as to who El Diablo (the new cartel druglord taking over a major pipeline) was. Early in the film I thought it was one character but was actually surprised and got a chuckle that it was someone else ! You'll never guess who it is until towards the end...Diesel's portrayal as Sean Vetter, a somewhat renegade DEA officer, trying to smoke out El Diablo for a personal vendetta does allow Diesel's acting abilities to show some vulnerbale and emotional moments without the man totally breaking down or hitting a melodramatic melting point...The video and audio technical aspects, well, are your average to pretty good run of the mill stuff. Surround effects are effective for ricocheting bullets, cars exploding, and  packed with rumbling bass for some pivotal scenes. The video transfer is clean and film-like with no harsh grain or color bleeding. Darks are dark to black and lights are light to bright...Clean picture, clean sound.As a casual Saturday evening, stay-in-home flick, A Man Apart is worth viewing once, but maybe not twice.",3,A Movie Picked Apart...,1074902400,"01 24, 2004",2004,1822,"['mixed', 'critiques', 'luke', 'warm', 'reviews', 'A', 'Man', 'Apart', 'ai', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Diesel', 'still', 'early', 'stage', 'acting', 'career', 'much', 'room', 'improvement', 'still', 'have', 'give', 'man', 'A', 'effort', 'least', 'soon', 'will', 'definitely', 'need', 'something', 'really', 'prove', 'can', 'play', 'other', 'well', 'rounded', 'multi-faceted', 'in-depth', 'roles', 'avoid', 'being', 'stereo', 'type', 'casted', 'stuck', 'tougher', 'tough', 'take', 'bs', 'guy', 'rest', 'career.There', 'only', 'so', 'many', 'limited', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'f', 'man', 'quot', 'expressions', 'viewers', 'can', 'take.Otherwise', 'will', 'just', 'be', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'well', 'playing', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'What', 'film', 'may', 'also', 'lack', 'story', 'depth', 'up', 'quick', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'thrilling', 'twist', 'did', 'keep', 'viewer', 'interested', 'who', 'El', 'Diablo', 'new', 'cartel', 'druglord', 'taking', 'over', 'major', 'pipeline', 'was', 'Early', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'character', 'was', 'actually', 'surprised', 'got', 'chuckle', 'was', 'someone', 'else', ""'ll"", 'never', 'guess', 'who', 'end', 'Diesel', 'portrayal', 'Sean', 'Vetter', 'somewhat', 'renegade', 'DEA', 'officer', 'trying', 'smoke', 'out', 'El', 'Diablo', 'personal', 'vendetta', 'allow', 'Diesel', 'acting', 'abilities', 'show', 'vulnerbale', 'emotional', 'moments', 'man', 'totally', 'breaking', 'down', 'hitting', 'melodramatic', 'melting', 'point', 'video', 'audio', 'technical', 'aspects', 'well', 'are', 'average', 'pretty', 'good', 'run', 'mill', 'stuff', 'Surround', 'effects', 'are', 'effective', 'ricocheting', 'bullets', 'cars', 'exploding', 'packed', 'rumbling', 'bass', 'pivotal', 'scenes', 'video', 'transfer', 'clean', 'film-like', 'harsh', 'grain', 'color', 'bleeding', 'Darks', 'are', 'dark', 'black', 'lights', 'are', 'light', 'bright', 'Clean', 'picture', 'clean', 'sound.As', 'casual', 'Saturday', 'evening', 'stay-in-home', 'flick', 'A', 'Man', 'Apart', 'worth', 'viewing', 'once', 'maybe', 'not', 'twice']",N/A

In some ways I ended up being pleasantly surprised, and in some ways I didn't.The surprise came from the fact that Vin Diesel truly does have a fair amount of acting ability and showed good emotional range as the husband of a murdered wife who becomes obsessed with finding her killers.  Vin does well as the strong, silent type with an explosive temper.  The bad came from the fact that the basic plot of this film made very little sense, especially the big ""who-dunnit"" at the end.  Was a big chunk of the movie edited out or what?  When the main villian is revealed, it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  As we get further along in the movie, the writing lapses into the same old cliches and tired old lines that popped up in all those 80s movies I was talking about.  The ending could have been ripped off from Cobra, Commando or one of those other flicks chock full of lame one-liners.

When I think action I think over the top thrills and intense stunts. I think adreniline, fast-paced suspense, and a certain momentum. I didn't find any of that in this film. But what I did find was a genuinely interesting story. Perhaps the concept has been done before - but that's the case with a lot of films these days. Looking past that: the movie does have substance. It delivers believable emotion and is worth sitting through at least once. I'd say the main draw is getting to see Vin Diesel stretch his wings a bit and hit us with something fresh. Sean Vetter is a little more unique than any of his previous characters.Perhaps not dramatically so - but we can see that Vin put forth an effort. I like the direction he's moving in - and you must admit - seeing him move in a different direction is reason enough to watch the movie. This one isn't about and edgy street racer like in The Fast And The Furious. Or an attitude-driven adreniline junkie as seen in XXX. This is a story about a man who loses his wife.

760302,A30NPOKSQY9PBB,B00009ZPUA,Christine Carrier,"[1, 2]","This is, as everyone knows, Vin Diesel's proof that he has range and depth with a character emotionally. He himself has said he loves getting in tune with a character. (Obviously moreso with his &quot;Riddick&quot; character of course.) So A Man Apart never seemed to be even hyped so much as a fantastic movie but moreso that Vin Diesel had to be a fantastic actor.The plot was very tired as everyone has pointed out. There are dozens of movies similar to this. A cop's significant other/child/family was murdered (sometimes, and in this case as well, the main character was supposed to be killed right along with them) ordered by a convict whom this said cop busted in some way. Cop seeks revenge. Cop gets revenge.A Man Apart is the same way, but carried by a normally rough-and-tumble action star (ironically, even this movie is labeled &quot;Action&quot;) showing that he can pull off these extreme emotional stakes. Many thought it would be laughable to see Vin Diesel nearly loose his mind and go on a killing spree to avenge his wife. But like the man or not, he pulled this role off powerfully.Sean watching his wife die under him while she was smiling through bloodied teeth repeating &quot;I'm okay, I'm fine..&quot; while he couldn't even speak on the phone to the police was wrenching to even watch. The bloodshot eyes (when drinking on the beach behind his house), the few seconds when realization first struck in while crying his wife's name (when Demetrius had to hold him down in his hospital bed), and the &quot;come down&quot; after the purposely insane shootout after he beats the man who actually did kill his wife, cleaning his wedding ring on his hand were undoubtedly the most powerful scenes in this movie. It was impossible not to empathize somehow with Sean Vetter during some points during this film.If you like Vin Diesel and want to see his range in a not so emotionally strong role, this is a good flick to add to your collection.The DVD itself was awful, the deleted scenes were up to three minutes max, no behind the scenes or making-of, and no commentary that you would think/hope this kind of movie would have.

Shortly after a successful joint mission in putting one of the most elusive drug cartel leaders, Meno Lucero, in jail, Vetter's home becomes the target of a ruthless attack that results in his wife's death.  With the name Diablo as his only lead, Sean must find a way to discover the identity of this mysterious person who is claiming Lucero's operation as his own, and to avenge the murder of the love of his life.While I appreciate the attempt at infusing some semblance of a plot into an otherwise straight up action movie, however, the effort is inconsistent and ultimately hurts the picture as a whole.  Rather than focusing on either giving the audiences an action packed adventure or a heart felt drama, what we end up with is a film that is average in both areas.  The gunfights in A Man Apart were poorly shot and chaotic, at times it was hard to tell the differences between the good guys and the bad ones.  The twists in the story made very little sense, and even though the romance displayed between Diesel and co-star Jacqueline Obradors is sweet, it really did not work for me or convince me of Sean's desire for revenge.  I also find it silly when movies have the tendency to suggest that criminals become more powerful when they are behind bars, if that is the case, what is the point of arresting them?With the exception of Pitch Black, I have never been a big fan of Vin Diesel's performances.  His monotone delivery of lines is often devoid of any feelings, and when he does exhibit emotions, frequently they seem to be forced and unnatural.  The same is true in his portrayal of the protagonist Sean Vetter.  This is largely the reason why the movie failed, if you are unable to make a connection with the lead character, why would you care what happens to him?Larenz Tate plays Vetter's partner Demetrius Hicks.  The two of them were good friends while growing up.  Their aspiration to make a difference in their neighborhood instead of complaining about it motivated them to join the anti-narcotics law enforcement unit.  There really isn't much to say about Tate, he did not make much of an impression in his scenes opposite of Diesel.  Timothy Olyphant, on the other hand, went way overboard as Hollywood Jack.  One minute he is a blubbering fool, another minute he becomes a cold-blooded killer, the discrepancies in the way the role was depicted demonstrates how poorly the whole film was scripted.A Man Apart is a derivative and an awful movie.  The lack of good action sequences, in combination with a superficial plot and paper-thin characters, result in a mediocre fare that was neither fun nor exciting to watch.  As for Vin Diesel, he still lacks that one defining role that has made actors like Stallone (as Rambo) and Schwarzenegger (as the Terminator and Conan) such big names in the genre.",1,"Unoriginal and boring, too bad the action isn't good either",1049587200,"04 6, 2003",2003,3072,"['A', 'Man', 'Apart', 'agents', 'Sean', 'Vetter', 'Demetrius', 'Hicks', 'are', 'part', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'best', 'drug', 'enforcement', 'agency', 'currently', 'making', 'effort', 'strike', 'massive', 'blow', 'narcotics', 'pipeline', 'borders', 'United', 'States', 'Mexico', 'Shortly', 'successful', 'joint', 'mission', 'putting', 'one', 'most', 'elusive', 'drug', 'cartel', 'leaders', 'Meno', 'Lucero', 'jail', 'Vetter', 'home', 'target', 'ruthless', 'attack', 'results', 'wife', 'death', 'name', 'Diablo', 'only', 'lead', 'Sean', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'discover', 'identity', 'mysterious', 'person', 'who', 'claiming', 'Lucero', 'operation', 'own', 'avenge', 'murder', 'love', 'life.While', 'appreciate', 'attempt', 'infusing', 'semblance', 'plot', 'otherwise', 'straight', 'up', 'action', 'movie', 'however', 'effort', 'inconsistent', 'ultimately', 'picture', 'whole', 'Rather', 'focusing', 'giving', 'audiences', 'action', 'packed', 'adventure', 'heart', 'felt', 'drama', 'what', 'end', 'up', 'film', 'average', 'areas', 'gunfights', 'Man', 'Apart', 'were', 'poorly', 'shot', 'chaotic', 'times', 'was', 'hard', 'tell', 'differences', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'ones', 'twists', 'story', 'made', 'very', 'little', 'sense', 'even', 'romance', 'displayed', 'Diesel', 'co-star', 'Jacqueline', 'Obradors', 'sweet', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'convince', 'Sean', 'desire', 'revenge', 'also', 'find', 'silly', 'when', 'movies', 'have', 'tendency', 'suggest', 'criminals', 'become', 'more', 'powerful', 'when', 'are', 'bars', 'case', 'what', 'point', 'arresting', 'exception', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'performances', 'monotone', 'delivery', 'lines', 'often', 'devoid', 'feelings', 'when', 'exhibit', 'emotions', 'frequently', 'seem', 'be', 'forced', 'unnatural', 'same', 'true', 'portrayal', 'protagonist', 'Sean', 'Vetter', 'largely', 'reason', 'why', 'movie', 'failed', 'are', 'unable', 'make', 'connection', 'lead', 'character', 'why', 'would', 'care', 'what', 'Larenz', 'Tate', 'Vetter', 'partner', 'Demetrius', 'Hicks', 'two', 'were', 'good', 'friends', 'growing', 'up', 'aspiration', 'make', 'difference', 'neighborhood', 'instead', 'complaining', 'motivated', 'join', 'anti-narcotics', 'law', 'enforcement', 'unit', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'say', 'Tate', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'much', 'impression', 'scenes', 'opposite', 'Diesel', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'other', 'hand', 'went', 'way', 'overboard', 'Hollywood', 'Jack', 'One', 'minute', 'blubbering', 'fool', 'minute', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'discrepancies', 'way', 'role', 'was', 'depicted', 'how', 'poorly', 'whole', 'film', 'was', 'scripted.A', 'Man', 'Apart', 'derivative', 'awful', 'movie', 'lack', 'good', 'action', 'sequences', 'combination', 'superficial', 'plot', 'paper-thin', 'characters', 'result', 'mediocre', 'fare', 'was', 'fun', 'exciting', 'watch', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'still', 'one', 'defining', 'role', 'made', 'actors', 'Stallone', 'Rambo', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Terminator', 'Conan', 'such', 'big', 'names', 'genre']",N/A

This type of film speaks to our sense of justice, when someone we love has had some wrong done to them, whether they be hurt, robbed, or worse, be killed, we want to go and set things right.  However, in reality we cannot always act on these feelings, as much as we may want to, which is where these movies come in.  For one, we don't actually have to go through any real pain or suffering, we simply vicariously live through the characters on screen, and through the emotional connection that is made, if something should happen to one of them, it instantly stirs that feeling for justice to be done.""A Man Apart"" is the story of a volatile DEA agent, Sean Vetter (Vin Diesel), who along with his partner Demetrius Hicks (Larenz Tate), go undercover to bring down the top Mexican drug lord.  With the toppling of the top drug lord in Mexico, a new cartel begins to assume control of Mexico, led by a man called Diablo, this new drug cartel is even more ruthless than the one before it.  To get the attention of the DEA, more importantly Sean Vetter, Diablo orders a hit on him, Vetter narrowly escapes with his life, sadly his wife was not so lucky.  Vowing to take revenge on Diablo, Vetter strikes a deal with the very drug lord he just put away, and with the aid of his DEA partner, Demetrius, sets out to deliver his own lethal brand of justice.Many revenge films have been hugely successful in Hollywood such as, ""Desperado"", ""The Punisher"", ""Four Brothers"", and many others.  Now, ""A Man Apart"" can be added to the list, directed by F. Gary Gray (director of ""The Negotiator"" and ""The Italian Job""), ""A Man Apart"" delivers a solid story of a broken man, that has lost the love of his life, and will stop at nothing until those responsible feel his wrath.  Vin Diesel delivers possibly his best performance to date, showing a wide range of emotions that he hadn't needed to portray in his previous films ""Pitch Black"" or ""The Fast and the Furious"", though some doubted his acting ability, Vin proves here that he is more than just another action hero.  The supporting cast is fairly strong, Larenz Tate is solid for the most part, as Vin's right-hand man, there are some weak spots in his performance, but they can be overlooked.  The action is fast-paced and frantic, but serves to show the fractured state of Vetter's life without his wife.  A problem many films of this genre can suffer from is an over-reliance on action, with not enough of a story to keep the audience engaged.  ""A Man Apart"" succeeds in eluding this pitfall, with a story that continues to engage the audience emotionally, so that the vengeance doesn't seem pointless.If you enjoy revenge tales or are a fan of Vin Diesel, then this is definitely a movie you should see.  Also, if you are one of the many nay-sayers regarding Vin Diesel's movies or his acting, then you should put your skepticism aside and give ""A Man Apart"" a try, I believe you will quickly see that Diesel definitely has what it takes to be more than just an average action star in Hollywood.""A Man Apart"" is rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity/sensuality.",4,Diesel's Best Performance Yet...,1136764800,"01 9, 2006",2006,3269,"['Revenge', 'movies', 'generally', 'do', 'well', 'American', 'film', 'audiences', 'other', 'reason', 'achieve', 'something', 'other', 'film', 'genres', 'can', 'not', 'type', 'film', 'speaks', 'sense', 'justice', 'when', 'someone', 'love', 'had', 'wrong', 'done', 'be', 'hurt', 'robbed', 'worse', 'be', 'killed', 'want', 'go', 'set', 'things', 'right', 'However', 'reality', 'can', 'not', 'always', 'act', 'feelings', 'as', 'much', 'may', 'want', 'where', 'movies', 'come', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'have', 'go', 'real', 'pain', 'suffering', 'simply', 'vicariously', 'live', 'characters', 'screen', 'emotional', 'connection', 'made', 'something', 'should', 'happen', 'one', 'instantly', 'feeling', 'justice', 'be', 'done', 'Man', 'Apart', 'story', 'volatile', 'DEA', 'agent', 'Sean', 'Vetter', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'who', 'partner', 'Demetrius', 'Hicks', 'Larenz', 'Tate', 'go', 'undercover', 'bring', 'down', 'top', 'Mexican', 'drug', 'lord', 'toppling', 'top', 'drug', 'lord', 'Mexico', 'new', 'cartel', 'assume', 'control', 'Mexico', 'led', 'man', 'called', 'Diablo', 'new', 'drug', 'cartel', 'even', 'more', 'ruthless', 'one', 'get', 'attention', 'DEA', 'more', 'importantly', 'Sean', 'Vetter', 'Diablo', 'orders', 'hit', 'Vetter', 'narrowly', 'life', 'sadly', 'wife', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'lucky', 'Vowing', 'take', 'revenge', 'Diablo', 'Vetter', 'deal', 'very', 'drug', 'lord', 'just', 'put', 'away', 'aid', 'DEA', 'partner', 'Demetrius', 'out', 'deliver', 'own', 'lethal', 'brand', 'justice.Many', 'revenge', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'hugely', 'successful', 'Hollywood', 'such', 'Desperado', 'Punisher', 'Four', 'Brothers', 'many', 'others', 'Now', 'Man', 'Apart', 'can', 'be', 'added', 'list', 'directed', 'F.', 'Gary', 'Gray', 'director', 'Negotiator', 'Italian', 'Job', 'Man', 'Apart', 'solid', 'story', 'broken', 'man', 'lost', 'love', 'life', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'responsible', 'feel', 'wrath', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'possibly', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'showing', 'wide', 'range', 'emotions', 'had', ""n't"", 'needed', 'portray', 'previous', 'films', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'doubted', 'acting', 'ability', 'Vin', 'here', 'more', 'just', 'action', 'hero', 'supporting', 'cast', 'fairly', 'strong', 'Larenz', 'Tate', 'solid', 'most', 'part', 'Vin', 'right-hand', 'man', 'are', 'weak', 'spots', 'performance', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked', 'action', 'fast-paced', 'frantic', 'show', 'fractured', 'state', 'Vetter', 'life', 'wife', 'problem', 'many', 'films', 'genre', 'can', 'suffer', 'over-reliance', 'action', 'not', 'enough', 'story', 'keep', 'audience', 'engaged', 'Man', 'Apart', 'eluding', 'pitfall', 'story', 'engage', 'audience', 'emotionally', 'vengeance', ""n't"", 'seem', 'pointless.If', 'enjoy', 'revenge', 'tales', 'are', 'fan', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'then', 'definitely', 'movie', 'should', 'see', 'Also', 'are', 'one', 'many', 'nay-sayers', 'regarding', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'movies', 'acting', 'then', 'should', 'put', 'skepticism', 'aside', 'give', 'A', 'Man', 'Apart', 'try', 'believe', 'will', 'quickly', 'see', 'Diesel', 'definitely', 'what', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'average', 'action', 'star', 'Hollywood', 'Man', 'Apart', 'rated', 'R', 'violence', 'language', 'brief', 'nudity/sensuality']",N/A

760335,A2F3M93RRLFQNJ,B00009ZPUA,mrliteral,"[4, 7]","A Man Apart is supposedly the story of a DEA agent played by Vin Diesel who becomes a one-man army against drug dealers after his wife is killed.  Unfortunately, it is actually an unintentional comedy about a dangerously incompetent man bent on revenge and the people (innocent or otherwise) who are hurt by him in the process.There are numerous flaws in this movie, with just enough entertainment value to rate it a high one-star.  Most glaringly to me was the loose way Diesel's character does little to protect his identity from criminals, showing up at press conferences and living in a nice beach house (how can he afford such a house...perhaps he's not as clean as depicted).  It's little wonder his wife is killed.  He abuses his power and blows operations, yet somehow we're supposed to feel he's wronged when he is suspended.For those who want action, there is a good deal of it, but most of it is in poorly lit situations, making the action hard to follow.  The one daytime shootout is vaguely reminiscent of the far superior shootout in Heat; yet even this scene is uninteresting, as by this point, the little sympathy for the character is completely gone.Diesel is usually better than this.  Unfortunately (a word I need to use repeatedly in this review), while he would never be expected to be the next Olivier, in this film, he seems interested in being the next Steven Seagal.

Gary Gray (The Negotiator, Friday, The Italian Job) directing a bad movie. Gray specializes in quick, tense, mindless action thrillers, and he seemingly never fails to deliver on the goods.Take A Man Apart. While it may well win the race for dumbest movie title of the year (original title Diablo was scrapped after a threatened lawsuit from Blizzard Entertainment, who are doing a movie of the videogame franchise of the same name), there's nothing at all wrong with the movie itself. Vin Diesel plays Sean Vetter, a narcotics officer involved in the taking down of drug kingpin Memo (Geno Silva, who ironically appeared in the TV movie El Diablo thirteen years before) Lucero. When a new guy known only as Diablo moves in to take over Santos' old operation, he begins by trying to take out Vetter. The assassins fail, but in the process, Vetters' wife Stacey (Jacqueline Obradors, recently of NYPD Blue and Tortilla Soup) is hit by a stray bullet and killed. I don't think anyone will be surprised when Vetter and his partner Demetrius (Larenz Tate of Menace II Society fame) start cleaning house.It's an old and well-used plot, and I'm sure a lot of people saw the twist coming at the end. (I didn't.) What makes the movie work, and work very well, is the chemistry between the characters. Gray gets emotion out of Vin Diesel for the first (and possibly last) time since Multi-Facial. The chemistry between Diesel and Tate is the best buddy-cop stuff since the first Lethal Weapon movie. It all works very well.Two hours of pure, brainless entertainment.

760349,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00009ZPUA,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 6]","Listen please.  Japanese theatrical release of F Gary Gray's &quot;A Man Apart&quot; was delayed so much that we could see his &quot;Italian Job&quot; (which was made after &quot;A Man Apart&quot;) several months earlier.  What does this lack of confidence  mean?Well, the answer is this.  &quot;A Man Apart&quot; has Vin Diesel as its star, so we expect something tense, something with action and perhaps humor.  No, though Vin Diesel still retains the same amount of charisma, it's a huge disappointment.As I said, Vin Diesel is good as the rough and tough cop Sean Vetter.  Raised in the street himself, he knows the bad things drugs can bring to your life more than any other cops, so Sean sometimes goes too far.  This time, in Mexico, he arrests a drug kingpin, ignoring his warning: &quot;You don't know what you're doing.&quot;So far, the film is good.  And you get (and Sean gets) what he gets -- new drug cartel takes over, and his wife is murdered.  Bent on revenge, he tries to find the guy who ordered the deadly attack....This kind of premise has been done many times, but &quot;A Man Apart&quot; attempts to give an edge to the story.  The drug king is given a certain amount of characterization.  That's a good thing if only the film is directed with assured skill of storytelling.  It has none.  Actually, I had hard time trying to figure out which is which in a certain shoot-out scene.  That kind of confusion happens again and again, and there is no substance in the second part of the film where Vin's character should be shining more.Think about any TV cop series in the 70s or 80s, like &quot;Miami Vice,&quot; and you get the picture.

760352,A254Z4O7ORVL6U,B00009ZPUA,wellwellwell,"[2, 2]","Vin Diesel is one of those actors who can bring an incredibly strong force to whatever movie he is in.  'A Man Apart' is no exception.  Now look at 'XXX', 'Fast And The Furious', and 'Pitch Black'.  Those three movies were all better-than-average, though none really had revolutionary plotlines.  Again, 'A Man Apart' is no exception.  The tough guys in drug-stopping bit has been done before (i.e. 'Training Day'), and over time, predictability takes this movie over.  But all that unoriginality and poor script stuff aside, Vin Diesel makes this film watch-able.  And enjoyable.One brilliancy I noticed that put this movie above the likes of the aforementioned trio, is that, here, Diesel suffers a hardship to his personal life.  After taking down (almost personally) one of the world's most prolific dealers, Sean's (Diesel) house is broken into, and his wife is killed.  After he realizes what'd happened, he cries.  And seeing Vin Diesel cry would be/is the equivalent of hell freezing over (as they say).  But instead of carrying his sadness with him to time off from work, he quickly looks to get revenge.  In order to justify his wife's death, he plans to take down the entire drug dealing universe.  But his friends and fellow cops are not always in the same boat as he.  Sean is soon overcome by anger and rage and eventually gets kicked off the force for (indirectly) killing three officers.  But to no avail, he continues his pursuit with the help of friends &quot;Big Sexy&quot; (George Sharperson) and Demetrius (Larenz Tate).  From there it's a bang-bang, action-packed, shot-in-the-leg-twice-but-still-able-to-run ground game that is nothing short of entertaining.If you like Mr. Diesel, you will like 'A Man Apart'.  It's as simple as that.  I think this is the best movie he's been in thus far, although this movie is far from flawless.  Again, the story is borderline been-done-before; whereas the action sequences are what make it a decent film in the first place.  Had the story been more innovative, I would've given it four stars.  However, even with a brilliant (but un-educational) performance by Vin Diesel and a crafty appearance by Timothy Olyphant ('Gone In 60 Seconds', 'Dreamcatcher'), 3 stars will have to do.
