This is an excellent series, in a fantastic packaging, at a very reasonable price.  The moment I saw this at a local Best Buy, I knew I had to buy it.

912603,A1QWUMKPPJUOYA,B0009UC6M6,Alex Tyte,"[0, 1]","Gungrave opens thirteen years after Brandon Heat is betrayed and killed by his best friend Harry MacDowell. He is reborn through the use of necro-rise as Beyond The Grave, and begins a quest of revenge against the crime syndicate. The series then backtracks to Brandon's youth, and follows him and Harry as they rise through the criminal underworld, detailing the circumstances that led to their eventual falling-out.In terms of the discs, the supernatural stuff doesn't start til about half-way through Disc 2. At first, when the story backtracked, I got annoyed that b/c was eager for more of the crazy stuff, but it all makes sense to see the rise to how it all started. I can see why it all works out this way b/c there is so much you need to know, so you can know the characters deeply and understand the story more clearly, otherwise you wouldn't be able to put yourself in Brandon Heats shoes to know exactly how he feels and what he went through.

The story focuses on mainly two friends, Brandon Heat and his friend Harry, and how they started out from nothing and rose through the ranks of the Millenon organization.  To make a long story short there is betrayal, although in the beginning you're not really sure who did the betraying, and Brandon dies, only to come back as Beyond the Grave, and undead being who deals with the nastiest parts of Milleneon which is by this time being run by Harry.  My only problem with this series was that there was too much focus on how the guys came up in the world, which while giving a context for what is going on and pretty much explaining everything, it was a little tiresome for me, but I would still highly recommend this to anyone, especially if you like gunfights, love, betrayal, and monsters along the way.",4,This is one of the good ones,1122768000,"07 31, 2005",2005,913,"['first', 'watched', 'somehow', 'expecting', 'be', 'much', 'darker', 'version', 'Trigun', 'was', 'so', 'wrong', 'story', 'mainly', 'two', 'friends', 'Brandon', 'Heat', 'friend', 'Harry', 'how', 'started', 'out', 'nothing', 'rose', 'ranks', 'Millenon', 'organization', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'betrayal', 'beginning', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'who', 'did', 'betraying', 'Brandon', 'dies', 'only', 'come', 'back', 'Beyond', 'Grave', 'undead', 'being', 'who', 'nastiest', 'parts', 'Milleneon', 'time', 'being', 'run', 'Harry', 'only', 'problem', 'series', 'was', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'focus', 'how', 'guys', 'came', 'up', 'world', 'giving', 'context', 'what', 'going', 'pretty', 'much', 'explaining', 'everything', 'was', 'little', 'tiresome', 'would', 'still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'especially', 'like', 'gunfights', 'love', 'betrayal', 'monsters', 'way']",Gungrave - The Complete
912605,A3O6E41H4V1TMN,B0009UC6M6,A&M Junkie,"[8, 9]","Upon looking at the cover of the first disc and hearing that the series was based upon a computer game I was originally put off from buying this. I imagined the series was a futurist shooting no-brainer aimed at 10 year boys (no offence). However, seduced by the first few volumes being reduced in price, I gave into temptation and bought them. And, my god, how wrong was I.The closet movie comparison I can make is to the ""Godfather.""  Two young guys, Harry and Brandon, who have been best friends since they were raised in an orphanage together, find themselves joining a mafia organization when their lives suddenly get turned up-side down after a petty battle with a small-time crook. The story charts what happens to our two friends after that, how both change in personality, and how eventuality they become fated to be enemies.The story opens with Brandon being raised from the dead through human experimentation to protect the daughter of the woman who he once loved from Harry. The story then goes back in time and charts their lives through their late teens, twenties and thirties. The story is slow-paced while it builds up the relationships between the main characters but very rewarding as you too begin to care deeply for the characters, especially the gorgeous sexy quiet Brandon.Although there are monsters in the form of genetically modified humans, the story concentrates on normal adults (instead of the usual teenagers) who are trying to form a career in the Mafia. Trust, friendship, love, greed and betrayal all influence the decisions made by our two friends and the people around them. The story also has the coolest action shooting sequences I have seen in anime.With great animation from Madhouse (who brought us Trigun and Tokyo Godfather - but this is better than both) and voice talents from Samurai Champloo, it would be a great shame to merely view this fantastic grown-up anime as simply a videogame rip-off.",5,"Anime's own ""Godfather""",1143331200,"03 26, 2006",2006,1940,"['looking', 'cover', 'first', 'disc', 'hearing', 'series', 'was', 'based', 'computer', 'game', 'was', 'originally', 'put', 'off', 'buying', 'imagined', 'series', 'was', 'futurist', 'shooting', 'no-brainer', 'aimed', '10', 'year', 'boys', 'offence', 'However', 'seduced', 'first', 'few', 'volumes', 'being', 'reduced', 'price', 'gave', 'temptation', 'bought', 'god', 'how', 'wrong', 'was', 'I.The', 'closet', 'movie', 'comparison', 'can', 'make', 'Godfather', 'Two', 'young', 'guys', 'Harry', 'Brandon', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'friends', 'were', 'raised', 'orphanage', 'together', 'find', 'joining', 'mafia', 'organization', 'when', 'lives', 'suddenly', 'get', 'turned', 'up-side', 'down', 'petty', 'battle', 'small-time', 'crook', 'story', 'what', 'two', 'friends', 'how', 'change', 'personality', 'how', 'eventuality', 'become', 'fated', 'be', 'enemies.The', 'story', 'Brandon', 'being', 'raised', 'dead', 'human', 'experimentation', 'protect', 'daughter', 'woman', 'who', 'once', 'loved', 'Harry', 'story', 'then', 'back', 'time', 'charts', 'lives', 'late', 'teens', 'twenties', 'thirties', 'story', 'slow-paced', 'relationships', 'main', 'characters', 'very', 'rewarding', 'too', 'begin', 'care', 'deeply', 'characters', 'especially', 'gorgeous', 'sexy', 'quiet', 'are', 'monsters', 'form', 'genetically', 'modified', 'humans', 'story', 'normal', 'adults', 'instead', 'usual', 'teenagers', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'form', 'career', 'Mafia', 'Trust', 'friendship', 'love', 'greed', 'betrayal', 'influence', 'decisions', 'made', 'two', 'friends', 'people', 'story', 'also', 'coolest', 'action', 'shooting', 'sequences', 'have', 'seen', 'anime.With', 'great', 'animation', 'Madhouse', 'who', 'brought', 'Trigun', 'Tokyo', 'Godfather', 'better', 'voice', 'talents', 'Samurai', 'Champloo', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'shame', 'merely', 'view', 'fantastic', 'grown-up', 'anime', 'simply', 'videogame', 'rip-off']",Gungrave - The Complete

Gungrave is a great series by any stretch but there are some quirks in the overall package that need to be addressed.The Animation, by Madhouse, is really good. There's no denying that . I was actually quite amazed at the overall execution of the animation itself. It's good eye candy.The sound is in Dolby Digital 5.1, which is excellent. Sound design was pretty good albeit I think they tried to make it too realistic. Grave's guns are thunderously loud and have a deep metallic resonance that you'd expect to hear out of guns that big. However that's about the best they did. All other guns in the series sound like toy pop guns rather that actual firearms. I should know I've shot a few.The biggest problem with this series is the music. Now before anyone gets their underwear in a bunch I'm a big fan of this series' composer, Tsuneo Imahori. I remember being amazed by the soundtrack to Trigun, but Gungrave's soundtrack just does NOT deliver. The music is repetitive and very boring. It just doesn't fit the series.For a series marketed on action it was very un-action oriented. The series was a bit too drawn out. The plot was excellent but poorly executed. Gungrave is the type of series that you can only really watch once. After that you know everything that's going to happen to the point that the series isn't worth watching anymore.The series box is pretty cool with artwork by the creator, Yasuhiro Nightow, himself. That's about this series' best attribute, sorry to say.This series is worth a viewing, that's why I rated it 4 stars, but if you're wondering whether or not to buy it my advise is to  rent it or Netflix the series. After that it's your call. It's a decent series.

912611,AGR4LKC72JEQ8,B0009UC6M6,coopertex,"[14, 15]","Gungrave is an drama/fantasy anime set around the 1960's. Harry McDowell and Brandon Heat were just two young street punks, who stole things and fought other street gangs to survive in their turfs. Harry and Brandon, grew up in a orphange and have been best friends ever since. They were willing to do whatever it took to rise to the top and achieve freedom from their life of poverty and danger. Their chance came up when they met a top member of the most powerful mafia called, Millenion. Harry and his best friend Brandon, start off as errand boys, doing petty jobs inside the Millenion organization, but you'll see as they climb up the ladder and become, the mafia's top executives. You'll see as their ambitions and greed take over their actions for better or worse.Gungrave is really an excellent anime all around. Even though its roots are based on a Playstation videogame, this anime is better than the game itself and should not be overlooked because you may have not enjoyed the videogame. The story theme about friendship, love, greed and betrayal is well scripted and feels similar to the, ""Godfather"" crime epic. Gungrave adds a supernatural twist by having undead creatures in the action. However, most of the story is told in a realistic fashion only dealing with the people drama. I enjoyed the epic feel of the story and became attached to many of the interesting characters, who were criminals by society's standards, but had a great sense of loyalty for each other. This is one of those anime series which contains a slow but engaging story. The production values are high; the animation is fluid, the artwork, character design, are excellent, the music is moody and the sound effects are loud. Both the English and Japanese voice acting are excellent and fit their characters well. There is graphic violence and profanity, so for adults only.

Brandon and Harry are two street hoods who join the mafia and begin the climb the ladder, and their ascension makes a mark on everyone around them.Gungrave is a noir, mafia story with an anime twist. It deals with the internal politics of the mob at first, before it becomes something personal for our main characters. Despite being in the business of killing, the Millenion syndicate has an unbreakable law, ""Protect, and never betray the family."" The ""Code of Iron"" drives the entire anime.Gungrave is not a shounen. It's closer to Cowboy Bebop and Trigun at certain points. There are no bombastic characters in the mafia. These are hired killers that disassociate themselves from their dirty business. The first half of the series focuses on Bradon's, the main character, memories of the time before he died. The anime twist are the horrors that unchecked ambition created, that Brandon must fight in the second half of the series. Despite being centered around organized crime, the violence doesn't feel gratuitous, there is no drug use, and matters of love (of any kind) are relatively tame.I definitely think Gungrave is worth a second look. If you liked Trigun and Cowboy Bebop, give this a shot. You might be pleasantly surprised.I gaze at that gray haired hulk and think, ""Beyong the Grave"" was once a man.

I didn't get into Trigun and don't understand why everyone loves that. Seriously. I don't understand. Anyway, as most people have summed up the plot to this, I won't.However, I agree with one reviewer that it might have taken a tad too long to show us the Early Years of Brandon and his friend Harry, but in a way it strengthens their relationship and the story because we know just how long they've know each other and how much they've sacrificed and fought for each other.Unfortunetly, the love interest for Brandon (Maria) is pretty much a caricature and does nothing for the story--or Brandon. But considering their struggles I can see how and why Harry wanted the Rise to Power, it makes sense. It's a good story and sad for Brandon; I liked Harry's relentless pursuit and while it was inevitable, I was still surprised by his betrayal of Brandon.

I honestly did'nt know what to expect when I first started watching this series, but in the end I was left with a smile on my face. This series really demonstrates relationships of people and how they can quickly turn sour.The series starts out with Brandon(The main character) fighting the creations that the evil company that his old friend(Harry) created. After that the series goes back in time to Brandon's and Harry's(The other main character(the creater of the creatures)) past. Its starts out with there teenage years. They are the leaders of a small group of street punks, but they were good kids that enjoyed the simple things in life. There group had five members including Brandon and Harry. They were all the best of friends not because they shared a common goal, but because they were all misfits. Then They get into a battle that comes back to bite them. They beat up a mafia leaders younger brother and so the mafia leader kills all of them except Harry and Brandon. Then because that mafia leader did that the mafia he was apart of killed him. Brandon and Harry then join the mafia making a pact to do what ever it takes to get to the top, but power and greed can corrupt even the purest of souls. Well I don't want to spoil the whole story now do I?This series is something that I can watch agian and agian. I recommend this series to anyone that enjoys watching anime. There is some foul language and blood, but nothing to serious. I do not recommend people under the age of 13 to watch this series.

Spivey,"[5, 9]","Well, one day, when I was watching G4TV (Anime Unleashed), I came across this Anime; I watched a few episodes, but it really didn't appeal to me much... Quite a few months, even a year or so later, it starting showing again, so, I said I'd give it another try, and so I did... Fell right in love with it right then. Has a Cowboy Bebop (my absolute favorite Anime) Storyline to it, from then on out, I watched it every night 'til it ended, and the ending was so good, and so very touching; very sad, though. And so, I waited a month or so for the English Dubbed Import to come out, and I bought that (even though they only put 20 episodes on it, and said they would release the last DVD with the last 6 episodes on it next month [August] or so), so, I'd say that everyone should buy the MI Import, especially since you save about $100 or more, and it's a direct rip from the R1 DVDs, with the exact same video quality, and everything else. At least give the Series a 6 or so episode benifit of the doubt, it's absolutely worth it. All should know it's from the makers of Trigun, as well, and without saying, you should already know that Trigun is one of the best Anime Series', and though Gungrave isn't quite as good, it's pretty close. Just try it out on G4TV first, if it's still on there, which I believe it is. A warning, though: this Series is about the Mafia, and therefore, it's definitely not suited for children; plenty of bloody scenes, and it's just oriented for mature audiences; we're talking 17-18+ (Graphic Violence, Gore, Profanity, and Adult Complex Themes).

912621,A3P6V42BGACXSA,B0009UC6M6,M. MOUA,"[2, 3]","Gungrave is a very well written japanation about two orphan friends who grew up on the streets. From small time street thugs to the top of the made-men of the Mafia world. They are not ordinary gangsters; they are the best of the best. They are the faces of the most powerful Mob, Milleneon. Harry, the brain and Brandon, the force. Combine both their strengths and they are unstoppable.Gungrave, I believe is a TV series in Japan because within every DVD, there are chapters. Each DVD is about 1 hour and 40 minutes long. It consists of seven DVD discs. I have a Netflix subscription and I have been renting this series for the past 2 weeks.This movie begins as Brandon is resurrected from the dead. He is no longer alive which has made him a lot stronger and powerful. Unable to be easily kill by bullets. Undead monsters approach him and he rips them apart with his powerful new futuristic gun. The remaining hit squad that came to kill him takes off running for their lives. He is trying to remember what happen to him and why these creatures are trying to kill him. He realized that he is with a little girl and an old man. He begins to remember his past, his best friend Harry. He must find his best friend Harry. The movie than flashes back into his past.Harry and Brandon are best friends on the vicious streets. Harry is smooth talker, a playboy who cons women into giving him the lifestyle he longs for. Brandon, a quite and shy boy who longs for the love of his crush, Maria. Maria is a girl who was saved by Brandon and have been by his side ever since. She lives with her uncle, a former mobster. The streets are tough and every now and then, unfortunate souls end up dead. Those souls happen to be Maria's uncle and three members of Harry's and Brandon's crew, they feel they need a new fresh start. They end up being taken in by Big Daddy, the godfather of the Milleneon. The most powerful mob in the city. Harry and Brandon started at the bottom and they both are determined to rise to the top. Harry, the brain moved up by increasing Milleneon's business profits while Brandon moved up the ranks as the mob's most deadly enforcer. Both are determined to one day be at the top and both are moving faster than any one in Melleneon's history. To reach the top, they have to eliminate others above them. Yet both are bound by the code of the mafia: Undying loyalty...betrayal is punishable by death. Loyalty to the family or friends becomes blur and decisions are made that will seal the fate of these two friends and their mafia, Milleneon.The bond between this two is unquestionable. They are not only best friends but are brothers. You feel the connection between Harry and Brandon. One will die for the other. One will never leave the other behind. But in the world of organized crime, where there can only be one, you often feel, how much longer can these two last. The majority of this movie is about the past, the bond and friendship between Harry and Brandon. Maria, even though a part of Brandon's life, she has a small role in this movie.Good:Amazing graphics. The artwork is amazing. Not childish like Pokemon or Dragon Ball Z. The story line is also great and is adult orientated. These movies have plenty of violence.No sex scene though, which is good. I remember watching Urotsukidoji, Lord of the Over fiend, there was violent sex every five minutes. A moving story about friendship, trials, and redemption.Good over all storyline between Brandon and Harry. You feel for them and root for them to get to the top of the organization.Bad:I was getting annoy because the movie should of all connected together. It is broken up in series with each DVD. Meaning, after each episode, the movie will go through the credits. Going through like five or six credits in one disc is annoying.The names of some of the characters and organization are also stupid and have very little originality. Crime family known as Lightning, come on....what a lame name...I'm not a crime lord but I would shoot myself if I came up with a name like that.The storyline between Brandon and Maria was a little weak since she is the love of his life. But understandable if you watch the movie, it must happen that way because it is the reason why Brandon is the way Brandon is.I wish the ending was a little better. Better closing for the remaining characters after the movie. What is going to happen to them, etc.Overall:A great animie, one of my favorites. I have seen a few. 5 out of 5 stars. Not perfect but good enough. May be I'm bias because I grew up on the tough streets...living by street rules...I don't know but I can relate to them and feel for them.",5,"Lots of action, great animie",1221091200,"09 11, 2008",2008,4660,"['Gungrave', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'japanation', 'two', 'orphan', 'friends', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'streets', 'small', 'time', 'street', 'thugs', 'top', 'made-men', 'Mafia', 'world', 'are', 'not', 'ordinary', 'gangsters', 'are', 'best', 'best', 'are', 'most', 'powerful', 'Mob', 'Milleneon', 'Harry', 'brain', 'Brandon', 'force', 'Combine', 'strengths', 'are', 'unstoppable.Gungrave', 'believe', 'TV', 'series', 'Japan', 'DVD', 'are', 'chapters', 'DVD', '1', 'hour', '40', 'minutes', 'long', 'seven', 'DVD', 'discs', 'have', 'Netflix', 'subscription', 'have', 'been', 'renting', 'series', 'past', '2', 'weeks.This', 'movie', 'Brandon', 'resurrected', 'dead', 'no', 'longer', 'alive', 'made', 'lot', 'stronger', 'powerful', 'Unable', 'be', 'easily', 'kill', 'bullets', 'Undead', 'monsters', 'approach', 'apart', 'powerful', 'new', 'futuristic', 'gun', 'remaining', 'hit', 'squad', 'came', 'kill', 'off', 'running', 'lives', 'trying', 'remember', 'what', 'happen', 'why', 'creatures', 'are', 'trying', 'kill', 'realized', 'little', 'girl', 'old', 'man', 'remember', 'past', 'best', 'friend', 'Harry', 'must', 'find', 'best', 'friend', 'Harry', 'movie', 'flashes', 'back', 'past.Harry', 'Brandon', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'vicious', 'streets', 'Harry', 'smooth', 'talker', 'playboy', 'who', 'women', 'giving', 'lifestyle', 'Brandon', 'quite', 'shy', 'boy', 'who', 'love', 'crush', 'Maria', 'Maria', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'saved', 'Brandon', 'have', 'been', 'side', 'ever', 'uncle', 'former', 'mobster', 'streets', 'are', 'tough', 'now', 'then', 'unfortunate', 'souls', 'end', 'up', 'dead', 'souls', 'happen', 'be', 'Maria', 'uncle', 'three', 'members', 'Harry', 'Brandon', 'crew', 'feel', 'need', 'new', 'fresh', 'start', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'taken', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'godfather', 'Milleneon', 'most', 'powerful', 'mob', 'city', 'Harry', 'Brandon', 'started', 'bottom', 'are', 'determined', 'rise', 'top', 'Harry', 'brain', 'moved', 'up', 'increasing', 'Milleneon', 'business', 'profits', 'Brandon', 'moved', 'up', 'ranks', 'mob', 'most', 'deadly', 'enforcer', 'are', 'determined', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'top', 'are', 'moving', 'faster', 'one', 'Melleneon', 'history', 'reach', 'top', 'have', 'eliminate', 'others', 'are', 'bound', 'code', 'mafia', 'Undying', 'loyalty', 'betrayal', 'punishable', 'death', 'Loyalty', 'family', 'friends', 'blur', 'decisions', 'are', 'made', 'will', 'seal', 'fate', 'two', 'friends', 'mafia', 'Milleneon.The', 'bond', 'two', 'unquestionable', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'best', 'friends', 'are', 'brothers', 'feel', 'connection', 'Harry', 'Brandon', 'One', 'will', 'die', 'other', 'One', 'will', 'never', 'leave', 'other', 'behind', 'world', 'organized', 'crime', 'where', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'one', 'often', 'feel', 'how', 'much', 'longer', 'can', 'two', 'last', 'majority', 'movie', 'past', 'bond', 'friendship', 'Harry', 'Brandon', 'Maria', 'even', 'part', 'Brandon', 'life', 'small', 'role', 'movie.Good', 'Amazing', 'graphics', 'artwork', 'amazing', 'Not', 'childish', 'Pokemon', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'story', 'line', 'also', 'great', 'adult', 'orientated', 'movies', 'have', 'plenty', 'violence.No', 'sex', 'scene', 'good', 'remember', 'watching', 'Urotsukidoji', 'Lord', 'Over', 'fiend', 'was', 'violent', 'sex', 'five', 'minutes', 'moving', 'story', 'friendship', 'trials', 'redemption.Good', 'storyline', 'Brandon', 'Harry', 'feel', 'root', 'get', 'top', 'organization.Bad', 'was', 'getting', 'annoy', 'movie', 'should', 'connected', 'together', 'broken', 'up', 'series', 'DVD', 'Meaning', 'episode', 'movie', 'will', 'go', 'credits', 'Going', 'five', 'six', 'credits', 'one', 'disc', 'annoying.The', 'names', 'characters', 'organization', 'are', 'also', 'stupid', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'originality', 'Crime', 'family', 'known', 'Lightning', 'come', '.what', 'lame', 'name', ""'m"", 'not', 'crime', 'lord', 'would', 'shoot', 'came', 'up', 'name', 'that.The', 'storyline', 'Brandon', 'Maria', 'was', 'little', 'weak', 'love', 'life', 'understandable', 'watch', 'movie', 'must', 'happen', 'way', 'reason', 'why', 'Brandon', 'way', 'Brandon', 'is.I', 'wish', 'ending', 'was', 'little', 'better', 'Better', 'closing', 'remaining', 'characters', 'movie', 'What', 'going', 'happen', 'etc.Overall', 'great', 'animie', 'one', 'favorites', 'have', 'seen', 'few', '5', '5', 'stars', 'Not', 'perfect', 'good', 'enough', 'May', 'be', ""'m"", 'bias', 'grew', 'up', 'tough', 'streets', 'living', 'street', 'rules', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'can', 'relate', 'feel']",Gungrave - The Complete
912622,AHF97M45JFCB,B0009UC6M6,ONENEO,"[14, 20]","The thing with Geneon's untimely demise is that it offered companies like Funimation a great library of unique titles to re-release as the market demands them.  Case in point: Gungrave.  A stylish and moody piece of animation that had, until now, existed in a complete boxed set briefly back in 2005.  Funimation has gathered together all of the episodes and is once more offering a Complete Set for fans and prospects alike.Coming in at a total runtime of 650 minutes, Gungrave the Complete Set spans 7 discs and comes packaged in seven thin packs within a richly decorated cardboard outer case.  Language options are standard sub and dub fair which means original Japanese dialog (Dolby Digital 2.0) and an English Dub (Dolby Digital 5.1) with English subtitle options in either language.The show wears an appropriate 16 & Up rating due to its frequent use of violence and strong language.  However, and like most anime titles of this genre, the presence of sexuality and/or nudity is surprisingly sparse.Features are a pretty solid bag and include 16:9 Anamorphic widescreen presentation, conceptual art stills, textless opening and closing themes, and a host of trailers.The story, or what passes for one in this case, follows a guy named Brandon Heat, who has been resurrected from the dead and is now known as Grave (which is short for Beyond the Grave).Under the supervision of a mad scientist and young girl, Grave wanders around his deserted hometown recollecting his memories and preparing for a mission of revenge against the friend who betrayed him (resulting in his trip six feet under).The first few episodes take their time assembling Grave's back-story through a succession of flashback sequences that depict a slightly disturbed Brandon Heat's involvement in street gangs.  Once the gangster ""Mad Dog"" Ladd enters the fold, gun shots ring out, are fired, blood is spilled, and soon it's just Brandon and his best friend Harry MacDowel fending for themselves on the city streets.For the most part, the pacing works.  How so you wonder?  Well the core of the viewer's interest is derived from the natural curiosity as to what led up to Grave's bizarre situation.You realize that Brandon and Harry are thick as thieves in their underworld exploits in life but logic tells you that this relationship must have soured.  How, when and why? How does Brandon meet his untimely demise? More importantly still, how does he return to the land of the living?You'll wonder these things just a bit quicker than the backtracking is able to reveal them but this is no big deal because a riveting story never was Gungrave's strong suit and shame on you for thinking otherwise.In truth the story is serviceable here which is to say it represents just enough to keep the wickedly cool visuals flowing from scene to scene, episode to episode.  You may have heard it mentioned in other reviews and there is definite truth to the fact that Grave is perhaps the most unlovable protagonist of all time.  He's distant, cold, and drab- and that's before he becomes a zombie!Although it should be dually noted that affection for the lead character isn't a requisite for making the most of the Gungrave experience.  The key word here is mood and boy does Gungrave paint a pretty picture through its lighting, ambiance, and just plain grit.  It isn't hard to liken the prose to the literary classic Gunslinger series by Stephen King.  In fact that's really one of the best comparisons I can come up with (just so long as you don't expect the mind-twisting elements that riddled the later entries of the book series).  Gungrave is definitely shallower, more violent, and linear in its pacing and prose.The English dub works better than it has any right to and perhaps that can be credited to the simple fact that the roles clearly didn't require a whole lot of emotion (particularly that of Grave himself).  The secondary characters simply had to be gruff, rough or tough and American actors, if I may generalize, rarely have trouble nailing that assignment.  The Japanese dialog brings a bit more emotion to the script but don't expect miracles from Grave, he is what is regardless of which continent the actor portraying him hails from.In all this is definitely not a title for the masses but rather is an acquired taste; kind of like black coffee or German beer.  If you're looking for a shoot-em-up with a simplistic plot saturated with vengeance (ala Kill Bill) and cool visuals (come on the guy blows his enemies away with his guns crossed and his hat dipped below his eyes for crying out loud), this is a must-own collection.  If, on the other hand, you find yourself in the camp seeking emotional attachment, rich storytelling or ultra-believability, perhaps you would be wiser to let this one drift past like the cloud of dust kicked up from Grave's cold stiff boot.",3,Vengeance is a Dish Best Served as a Complete Collection,1247616000,"07 15, 2009",2009,4862,"['thing', 'Geneon', 'untimely', 'demise', 'offered',

The series gives a nice backdrop of the two main characters and their differing points of view on life and while they disagree on some views they are the best of friends, though the main story-plot does have on betray the other for his own rise to power within a powerful organization. The dead apparently don't stay dead though in this series and through science the betrayed friend is brought back to life to protect a very important person from the organization that is now run by the very friend that betrayed and murdered him.  What you'll truly appreciate and grow to like is how throughout the years the betrayer has hidden regrets for his choices and a wish to redeem his sins that he's made in his life.  That is probably the most heartfelt parts of the series as you see the bygone years of these two friends as they rise from street hoodlums to great power and money in their careers, but you also see the cost for theses choices as their friends are killed, personal sacrifices are made for their positions or remaining living friends, and finally the one choice that ends with one friend dead and another to gain ultimate power but at the cost of his remaining happiness.  The ending fits the storyline greatly and while may annoy some viewers with how it ends it's still a nice climax for the two friends to find salvation and peace within themselves and each other.  The video is clear and sharp with no blurriness or distortions to worry about and the audio was great as well the voice cast for the Japanese and English actors/actresses were great for their roles, the extras sadly aren't much just the usual trailers and textless intro/ending songs but that's about it. The box sets has seven dvds put into an individual slim cases and put into a paper sleeve. So if you like the dark drama animes with a lot of action, gunfights, and drama with a entertaining storyline with it here's a great choice to try out and for this price well worth it...",5,A Nice Series Of Revenge and Betrayal But Also Of Forgiveness And Redemption,1253664000,"09 23, 2009",2009,2101,"['already', 'have', 'anime', 'series', 'Samurai', 'Champloo', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'Wolfs', 'rain', 'here', 'fantastic', 'series', 'collection', 'series', 'nice', 'backdrop', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'differing', 'points', 'view', 'life', 'disagree', 'views', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'main', 'story-plot', 'have', 'betray', 'other', 'own', 'rise', 'power', 'powerful', 'organization', 'dead', 'apparently', 'do', ""n't"", 'stay', 'dead', 'series', 'science', 'betrayed', 'friend', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'protect', 'very', 'important', 'person', 'organization', 'now', 'run', 'very', 'friend', 'betrayed', 'murdered', 'What', ""'ll"", 'truly', 'appreciate', 'grow', 'like', 'how', 'years', 'betrayer', 'hidden', 'regrets', 'choices', 'wish', 'redeem', 'sins', 'made', 'life', 'probably', 'most', 'heartfelt', 'parts', 'series', 'see', 'bygone', 'years', 'two', 'friends', 'rise', 'street', 'hoodlums', 'great', 'power', 'money', 'careers', 'also', 'see', 'cost', 'theses', 'choices', 'friends', 'are', 'killed', 'personal', 'sacrifices', 'are', 'made', 'positions', 'remaining', 'living', 'friends', 'finally', 'one', 'choice', 'one', 'friend', 'dead', 'gain', 'ultimate', 'power', 'cost', 'remaining', 'happiness', 'ending', 'storyline', 'greatly', 'may', 'annoy', 'viewers', 'how', 'still', 'nice', 'climax', 'two', 'friends', 'find', 'salvation', 'peace', 'other', 'video', 'clear', 'sharp', 'blurriness', 'distortions', 'worry', 'about', 'audio', 'was', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'voice', 'cast', 'Japanese', 'English', 'actors/actresses', 'were', 'great', 'roles', 'extras', 'sadly', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'just', 'usual', 'trailers', 'textless', 'intro/ending', 'songs', 'box', 'seven', 'dvds', 'put', 'individual', 'slim', 'cases', 'put', 'paper', 'sleeve', 'So', 'like', 'dark', 'drama', 'lot', 'action', 'gunfights', 'drama', 'entertaining', 'storyline', 'here', 'great', 'choice', 'try', 'out', 'price', 'well']",Gungrave - The Complete

It is a stylish show for mature audiences with complex characters, an intriguing storyline, stunning visuals, great music, and superbly directed action sequences.  The story follows the lives of two young men, Brandon Heat and Harry MacDowell. Both are orphans who have formed a strong bond with one another since they have known each other since childhood. Even though they are close friends they are total opposites.  Brandon is a shy, introvert, who barely speaks, a tough fighter, and the kind of guy who is highly devoted to the well being of his friends.  Harry on the other hand is an extrovert, a natural leader, a great communicator, good with women, a thinker, and a little selfish.They spend their youth content to not have a steady-legit job in a dangerous, crime riddle city.  They survive through their involvement in petty gang activities and through coning people.  Their simple, wasted youth comes to an abrupt and deadly end when a member of a rival gang seeks to exact revenge against them by involving his older, mafia brother ""Mad Dog"" Ladd Carabel into the conflict that he his having with Harry and Brandon's gang.  Mad Dog decides the best way to restore his family's honor is to kill Brandon, Harry, and their gang.  He succeeds in killing off all the members of their gang and prepares to kill Brandon and Harry.  Just when it looks like their meaningless lives will come to an end they are aided by a members of another crime syndicate known as Millenion.It is at this time that both Harry and Brandon's lives head in a new direction.  Harry becomes obsessed with obtaining the power that Millenion has and desire to take it.  Brandon on the other hand desires to not be separated from his best friend Harry and to locate Maria who is a shy blonde girl that he has affection for who has unknowingly become involved with the Millenion organization.While in the organization both young men lose the last bit of their youthful innocence and Brandon's goals shift.  Brandon becomes a hitman for the organization.  He also establishes a good relationship with the head of the organization ""Big Daddy"" who feels that Brandon is a good guy and that he reminds him a lot of himself when he was younger.  The two develop a father son relationship.  As a result of meeting Big Daddy Brandon becomes a devoted member of the Millenion crime organization.  He wishes to use the organization for the reason that Big Daddy created it and that is to protect is loved ones:  Harry, Big Daddy, and Maria.  However Brandon's simple goal will prove harder to accomplish than it sounds.On the other hand Harry remains obsessed with obtaining the power that Millenion has. As he advances in the organization he aims for higher and higher positions of power and uses any method to get there.  This naturally leads him to break the organization's Code of Iron (which is never to betray the organization or its members) repeatedly even though the penalty for breaking Millenion's Code of Iron is death. As the years past the only position of power that remains for Harry is ""Big Daddy's"" spot as the head of the organization.Naturally Harry's ambition leads to conflict between the two men.  This conflict takes a deadly twist.  Soon Brandon finds himself on the receiving end of a several bullet shots from his best friend.Fast-forward 13 years and a necrolized Brandon finds himself awakened from his slumber by a young girl who bears a striking resemblance to Maria who is being targeted by a Harry (now known as ""Bloody Harry"" for his ruthlessness) controlled Millenion for death.  He also wakens in a far darker and dangerous place than the world that he once knew.  It is a world where all of his former friends and allies are now his enemies.  The events that happen from this point on surprisingly do not follow the generic ones that typically happen in an action-orientated betrayal type story.  What you get instead is something far more effective and refreshing.  I highly recommend watching this show.

912630,A3OZMHAH1QP1YK,B0009UC6M6,VIN,"[3, 6]","I purchased the complete box set of GunGrave and watched it over 3 days. I'm a fan of anime's such as Trigun, Neon Genesis, Berserk, Ghost in the Shell and other popular anime.What I found was a derivative and drawn out anime with very little character development, heavily substituted fight scenes, and a basic plotline. To top this off it is all filled with a personality-lacking, comatose main character, Brandon Heat aka Beyond the Grave.While I can't fault the animation or the sound, I am really let down by the story. It takes really 20 or so episodes to really reach any kind of serious action. The story is unclear in its setting (ie. locale and time setting), and is marred by repetitiveness (despite one 5-star reviewer here saying it was not repetitive).To put it into perspective, your main opponents are mindless zombies, a fat character who is rather annoying, and, apart from one or two 'cool' characters, the main bad guy who's basically.... a businessman.Where repetitiveness sets in is in the talk of family honour, or code. The blase gunfights, mindless and derivative talk of revenge, and hollow love connections that are awkward rather than empathetic and hopeful. The men are typically either overly brave or full of cowardice whereas the female characters are helpless, teary eyed and irritating.Suffice to say, questions are left unanswered. Where did Brandon get such impressive weapons from? What happened to his family? How did Blood War and his partner happen upon a necrolization machine? Is he really loyal to any one particular thing or is he just a walking 'problem' that exasperates the entire situation?I expected more from Gungrave. Perhaps not the same whacky humour of Trigun or the rollercoaster action and drama of Cowboy Bebop, but the only recommendable thing about it I feel, is maybe for those who have a thing for mafia stories, albeit shallow.Overall, sorry to portray it as such, but Gungrave to me is a failure in characterisation & plotline. It can easily be outshined by other anime, and that's where I think your money should go.",3,Dissapointing,1229126400,"12 13, 2008",2008,2080,"['purchased', 'complete', 'box', 'set', 'GunGrave', 'watched', '3', 'days', ""'m"", 'fan', 'anime', 'such', 'Trigun', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Berserk', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'other', 'popular', 'found', 'was', 'derivative', 'drawn', 'out', 'anime', 'very', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'heavily', 'substituted', 'fight', 'scenes', 'basic', 'plotline', 'top', 'filled', 'personality-lacking', 'comatose', 'main', 'character', 'Brandon', 'Heat', 'Grave.While', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'animation', 'sound', 'am', 'really', 'let', 'down', 'story', 'really', '20', 'so', 'episodes', 'really', 'reach', 'kind', 'serious', 'action', 'story', 'unclear', 'setting', 'ie', 'locale', 'time', 'setting', 'marred', 'repetitiveness', 'one', '5-star', 'reviewer', 'here', 'saying', 'was', 'not', 'repetitive', 'put', 'perspective', 'main', 'opponents', 'are', 'mindless', 'zombies', 'fat', 'character', 'who', 'rather', 'annoying', 'apart', 'one', 'two', ""'cool"", 'characters', 'main', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'basically', 'businessman.Where', 'repetitiveness', 'sets', 'talk', 'family', 'honour', 'code', 'blase', 'gunfights', 'mindless', 'derivative', 'talk', 'revenge', 'hollow', 'love', 'connections', 'are', 'awkward', 'rather', 'empathetic', 'hopeful', 'men', 'are', 'typically', 'either', 'overly', 'brave', 'full', 'cowardice', 'female', 'characters', 'are', 'helpless', 'teary', 'eyed', 'irritating.Suffice', 'say', 'questions', 'are', 'left', 'unanswered', 'Where', 'did', 'Brandon', 'get', 'such', 'impressive', 'weapons', 'What', 'happened', 'family', 'How', 'did', 'Blood', 'War', 'partner', 'happen', 'necrolization', 'machine', 'really', 'one', 'particular', 'thing', 'just', 'walking', ""'problem"", 'entire', 'situation', 'expected', 'more', 'Gungrave', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'same', 'whacky', 'humour', 'Trigun', 'rollercoaster', 'action', 'drama', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'only', 'recommendable', 'thing', 'feel', 'maybe', 'who', 'have', 'thing', 'mafia', 'stories', 'shallow.Overall', 'sorry', 'portray', 'such', 'Gungrave', 'failure', 'characterisation', 'plotline', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'outshined', 'other', 'anime', 'where', 'think', 'money', 'should', 'go']",Gungrave - The Complete

My other shock was that they were $30 each. I sold them on eBay after deciding NOT to support this pricepoint, and hoping for AT LEAST a reasonably priced boxset somewhere down the road. Well, I'm down that road now, and from where I stand you'd either have to be a millionaire to buy this set, or not hip to current price structures for every other DVD box set. Hell, even classic Star Trek and the greedy powers-that-be at Paramount ""only"" ask $100 for a boxset. Here, I'm supposed to pay nearly DOUBLE that already inflated price? HA!! This set should not be more than $50, and I think we all know that.**Please note: If these discs are actually made of 18K or 24K gold then please disregard this rant.",3,Animation Quality? 5 stars.
