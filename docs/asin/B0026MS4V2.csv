The concert is put together very well seeing how each song is from a different city. The documentary that comes with it is good too. A very well-thought compilation of the History of Maiden, all on one tour. And that Boeing 757 (Ed Force One) is really neat, especially since lead-singer Bruce Dickinson is also the pilot.See that kids?

So I did.The bluray features 2 ways to watch the concert:- a film, half of it is the live performances in the diferent countries for each song, and documentary footage in between each of the songs, where you can see the band doing different kinds of stuff both at the country of the concert and in flight, interviews, backstage, you name it.- full concert, what you were expecting to see, the songs played back to back, no interruptions.Video quality is absolutely amazing, one of the best i've seen for a live concert dvd. Crisp, clear picture. one of the best in my collection. (maybe I'm still overwhelmed by the blu-ray quality)Audio quality is great, it sounds very good in my 2.1 system, very clear sound. I bet in a 5.1 HD would sound amazingly good, but that's for you to find out.I had a lot of fun watching the whole film, an interesting and never before seen documentary of the things a band would do, and that you have always wondered. Perhaps that is the suprise about this film, since you realize these guys do just the usual things normal people would do.The song selection was amazing. You can see  most of their big hits, and you can feel the power and energy deployed on stage by these great musicians playing their own songsI give this Blu-ray 5 stars because of the excellent video and audio quality, because it is a fun movie/concert to watch, the good edition, and the great song selection.",5,a definitive piece for the Live Concert collection,1254268800,"09 30, 2009",2009,1543,"[""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Maiden', 'i', 'do', 'lot', 'songs', 'watched', 'preview', 'Bluray', 'felt', 'i', 'had', 'get', 'So', 'did.The', 'bluray', 'features', '2', 'ways', 'watch', 'concert', 'film', 'half', 'live', 'performances', 'diferent', 'countries', 'song', 'documentary', 'footage', 'songs', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'band', 'doing', 'different', 'kinds', 'stuff', 'country', 'concert', 'flight', 'interviews', 'backstage', 'name', 'it.-', 'full', 'concert', 'what', 'were', 'expecting', 'see', 'songs', 'played', 'back', 'back', 'interruptions.Video', 'quality', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'one', 'best', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'live', 'concert', 'dvd', 'Crisp', 'clear', 'picture', 'one', 'best', 'collection', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'still', 'overwhelmed', 'blu-ray', 'quality', 'Audio', 'quality', 'great', 'very', 'good', '2.1', 'system', 'very', 'clear', 'sound', 'bet', '5.1', 'HD', 'would', 'sound', 'amazingly', 'good', 'find', 'out.I', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'watching', 'whole', 'film', 'interesting', 'never', 'before', 'seen', 'documentary', 'things', 'band', 'would', 'do', 'have', 'always', 'wondered', 'Perhaps', 'suprise', 'film', 'realize', 'guys', 'do', 'just', 'usual', 'things', 'normal', 'people', 'would', 'do.The', 'song', 'selection', 'was', 'amazing', 'can', 'see', 'most', 'big', 'hits', 'can', 'feel', 'power', 'energy', 'deployed', 'stage', 'great', 'musicians', 'playing', 'own', 'songsI', 'give', 'Blu-ray', '5', 'stars', 'excellent', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'fun', 'movie/concert', 'watch', 'good', 'edition', 'great', 'song', 'selection']",Flight 666

The back channels on the surround mix are nothing but crowd noise with a little echo thrown in.  I was watching this BD last night and had the thought why don't i turn off the rear channel amp and see how that sounds.  WOW!  No more 25,000 screaming fans, just the boys playing loud and proud.  Great job of post production on this as well.  Some if not all lead guitar parts have been dubbed, that and Bruce's voice is a little prominent in some spots.  Drums are well recorded or dubbed on some tracks and seem lost in the mix on others.  Still a great concert video of Bruce and the lads on what was probably their last hurrah.  I was in TX last year or the year before when yet another IM tour was underway and the reviews of that show were not good to say the least.

Their means of transportation was a Boeing 757, which carried the band, the fans, and the crew, as well as up to 12 tons of stage equipment. The pilot? Vocalist Bruce Dickinson.Flight 666 is an incredible documentary that documents the first leg of this adcenturous tour. Made by Samm Dunn and Scot McFadyen, the geniuses behind two other awesome documentaries, ""Metal: A Headbanger's Journey"" and ""Global Metal"", this film is a treat for all Maiden fans.During the 112 minutes, we see the band travel from country to country, with some breathtaking shots of the plane flying, and some great footage of the band when they're NOT on stage too. We even get gootage of the band on the plane, having fun as usual. They do such things as go golfing, visit the Mexican pyramids, and much more too. Thbe band are their usual selves with their usual sense of humor, which is expected! Of course Nicko has his usual hilarity too!The concert footage is flat out amazing. Real up-close-and-personal footage, it gets my blood pumping every time I think of it. No overdubs in the audio as well, and the great audio quality is enough to make you feel like you're at the concert. Watching this movie made me think back to when I saw them on the second leg of the tour, and what a magical night it was too.In short, this movie is a must see for all Maiden fans, and all fans of good music in general. It's a must-own too! I own the blu-ray, and have already watched it 3 times! But you know the deal, 3 times is never enough... not even 1000 times is enough!The Blu-Ray quality is stunning. The picture quality is the best Blu-Ray quality, no doubt. There is an added grain in some shots, but that is to add a dramatic documentary look. Everything looks AWESOME here. The concert footage is awesome, makes you feel like you're there. The sound quality is stunning too- the DTS HD audio is awesome, if you have your system hooked up properly you can feel the music as if you're at the concert! The bonus concert footage is awesome as well. You get the full songs, with footage of the cities the songs are performed in before the songs.So do NOT miss this film, and especially do NOT miss this blu-ray release too!",5,What do you know?

I don't know why he is playing some of Adrian's solos - Adrian wrote them, and his erratic style of play does not do Adrian's precise structure any justice.

Being a huge fan of Iron Maiden, when Flight 666 came out this June along with soundtrack of the film(the live songs on disc 2)I had to buy it. This film was said to be showing the band's life on tour and everyone who knows the band know that they are private to a certain point about their lives. Here they are showing the fans what it's like to be in the band or working for the band. And I haven't been disappointed, I've been surprised on how complete it was as it goes into details and there are interesting stories from the countries they played during the tour.You have to understand first that Iron Maiden is not your average band. No other band has a lead singer who also pilots the band's own private plane during a tour across five continents. They are also respected everywhere they go and they have influenced many bands of today.You have to admire them for staying down to earth people with their success and for the fact that they have many good songs and albums. They are an entertaining onstage and fans will find out just like I did that they are as much offstage. Capturing the intensity of band on tour is not an easy task but Sam Dunn's team (for those who don't know him, he made the Metal - A Headbanger's Journey and Global Metal documentaries which I would recommend watching if you are a fan of rock n' roll music or heavy metal or whatever YOU want to call it) just did that, I'm glad they were the ones who did this documentary as someone else might have screwed up. Oh and this is not about Dunn it's about the band.The purpose of the Somewhere Back In Time tour was to offer their increasingly younger fan base those classics song they might not have seen the band perform before. This means for the band going back to the classics, for this tour they performed songs like ""Rime Of The Ancient Mariner""(Bruce Dickinson said it was his favorite song to perform during the tour) and ""Can I Play With Madness"". They always played their old stuff but this goes further into the songs they didn't play, of course the tour still featured songs they always play like ""Number Of The Beast"" and ""Fear of The Dark"". The stage set was even reminiscent of the one used during the Powerslave tour mixed with a little of Somewhere In Time, it looks very good. The live footage shown in this film will likely blow you away, the band sounds amazing.It also shows people talking about Iron Maiden and their stories are interesting to hear. For instance the Priest who has many tattoos of the band and claims to be their biggest fan. Or someone saying just how much an Iron Maiden concert means to them, for how long they've been waiting etc. It may sound boring here but it certainly isn't. You see the road crew, how they build the stage, the fans nearly making a riot at a hotel where the band stays. It seems everyone was having fun during this tour, everyone smiles and tells jokes, fools around or something, you see that the band enjoy each others company and they still like selling out their concerts all over the world.Iron Maiden has always been exciting to watch and this Blue Ray is another reason why, it looks stunning visually. You also get another disc of the 17 live songs used on the Flight 666 soundtrack; the songs have been picked from different cities so each song is different from another. The film shows a good part of this disc already but if you only want to watch the live part it's nice to have. I have it and I've watched it already a good dozen times and each time I find it as good as before. Live After Death is the best Maiden concert but Flight 666 is a great look at the band and is just as good. If you're a fan this a must never before has Maiden been shown this way, it's hard to believe just how good it is. It's hard to describe but if you are a fan of the band you just have to see this.",5,"Wonderful inside look on the ""Somewhere Back In Time"" tour",1269388800,"03 24, 2010",2010,3962,"['Flight', '666', 'Film', 'band', 'Somewhere', 'Back', 'Time', 'tour', '23', 'concerts', 'band', 'were', 'playing', 'Being', 'huge', 'fan', 'Iron', 'Maiden', 'when', 'Flight', '666', 'came', 'out', 'June', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'live', 'songs', 'disc', '2', 'had', 'buy', 'film', 'was', 'said', 'be', 'showing', 'band', 'life', 'tour', 'everyone', 'who', 'band', 'know', 'are', 'private', 'certain', 'point', 'lives', 'Here', 'are', 'showing', 'fans', 'what', 'be', 'band', 'working', 'band', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'disappointed', ""'ve"", 'been', 'surprised', 'how', 'complete', 'was', 'details', 'are', 'interesting', 'stories', 'countries', 'played', 'tour.You', 'have', 'understand', 'first', 'Iron', 'Maiden', 'not', 'average', 'band', 'other', 'band', 'lead', 'singer', 'who', 'also', 'pilots', 'band', 'own', 'private', 'plane', 'tour', 'five', 'continents', 'are', 'also', 'respected', 'everywhere', 'go', 'have', 'influenced', 'many', 'bands', 'today.You', 'have', 'admire', 'staying', 'down', 'earth', 'people', 'success', 'fact', 'have', 'many', 'good', 'songs', 'albums', 'are', 'entertaining', 'onstage', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'did', 'are', 'as', 'much', 'offstage', 'Capturing', 'intensity', 'band', 'tour', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'Sam', 'Dunn', 'team', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'made', 'Metal', 'Headbanger', 'Journey', 'Global', 'Metal', 'documentaries', 'would', 'recommend', 'watching', 'are', 'fan', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'music', 'heavy', 'metal', 'YOU', 'want', 'call', 'just', 'did', ""'m"", 'glad', 'were', 'ones', 'who', 'did', 'documentary', 'someone', 'else', 'might', 'have', 'screwed', 'up', 'Oh', 'not', 'Dunn', 'band.The', 'purpose', 'Somewhere', 'Back', 'Time', 'tour', 'was', 'offer', 'increasingly', 'younger', 'fan', 'base', 'classics', 'song', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'band', 'perform', 'before', 'band', 'going', 'back', 'classics', 'tour', 'performed', 'songs', 'Rime', 'Ancient', 'Mariner', 'Bruce', 'Dickinson', 'said', 'was', 'favorite', 'song', 'perform', 'tour', 'Can', 'Play', 'Madness', 'always', 'played', 'old', 'stuff', 'further', 'songs', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'course', 'tour', 'still', 'featured', 'songs', 'always', 'play', 'Number', 'Beast', 'Fear', 'Dark', 'stage', 'set', 'was', 'even', 'reminiscent', 'one', 'used', 'Powerslave', 'tour', 'mixed', 'little', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'very', 'good', 'live', 'footage', 'shown', 'film', 'will', 'likely', 'blow', 'away', 'band', 'amazing.It', 'also', 'people', 'talking', 'Iron', 'Maiden', 'stories', 'are', 'interesting', 'hear', 'instance', 'Priest', 'who', 'many', 'tattoos', 'band', 'claims', 'be', 'biggest', 'fan', 'someone', 'saying', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'Iron', 'Maiden', 'concert', 'how', 'long', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'etc', 'may', 'sound', 'boring', 'here', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'see', 'road', 'crew', 'how', 'build', 'stage', 'fans', 'nearly', 'making', 'riot', 'hotel', 'where', 'band', 'everyone', 'was', 'having', 'fun', 'tour', 'everyone', 'smiles', 'tells', 'jokes', 'fools', 'around', 'something', 'see', 'band', 'enjoy', 'others', 'company', 'still', 'selling', 'out', 'concerts', 'world.Iron', 'Maiden', 'always', 'been', 'exciting', 'watch', 'Blue', 'Ray', 'reason', 'why', 'stunning', 'visually', 'also', 'get', 'disc', '17', 'live', 'songs', 'used', 'Flight', '666', 'soundtrack', 'songs', 'have', 'been', 'picked', 'different', 'cities', 'so', 'song', 'different', 'film', 'good', 'part', 'disc', 'already', 'only', 'want', 'watch', 'live', 'part', 'nice', 'have', 'have', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'already', 'good', 'dozen', 'times', 'time', 'find', 'as', 'good', 'before', 'Live', 'Death', 'best', 'Maiden', 'concert', 'Flight', '666', 'great', 'look', 'band', 'just', 'as', 'good', ""'re"", 'fan', 'must', 'never', 'before', 'Maiden', 'been', 'shown', 'way', 'hard', 'believe', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'hard', 'describe', 'are', 'fan', 'band', 'just', 'have', 'see']",Flight 666
