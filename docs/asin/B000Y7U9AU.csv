1116202,A35JR4D6FLXYRQ,B000Y7U9AU,Geminigirl,"[1, 3]","I watched a few episodes of the first season of GIRLFRIENDS but had issues with it so stopped watching it.  First of all, I compared it negatively to the then cancelled LIVING SINGLE.  Secondly, I didn't ""get"" the characters and felt that they were way too over the top and fake.  Third, I hated the cut-aways to show viewers ""Joan's thoughts"".  I didn't give the show another chance until the popular ""church episode"" of Season 2 aka, Toni & Joan's reconciliation.  I became intrigued with what their fight had been about and if they could truly put their friendship back together therefore I decided to watch the entire third season & I'm so glad that I did!As an avid tv fan I should know by now that sometimes the first 2 seasons of shows can be a sort of testing ground and that if you stick with the initial bad storylines, you get to know and love the characters as the storylines get stronger and draw you in.  On a superficial level, I loved the characters' Joan & Toni's wardrobes so in addition to anticipating the stories, I anticipated seeing what they'd be wearing.During this season the strongest storylines were Toni's relationship with Todd, William's relationship with Monica and Maya's marital struggles & subsequent single status; another hilarious side story were the few episodes when all of the main characters (except Toni) were living in Joan's house.The negatives about this season: I hated the pairing of Joan & Ellis because the two actors had no chemistry so their relationship was very boring to me and Lynn's entire purpose seemed to be the punchline - the appearance of her birth mother & her adoptive parents appearing to demand that she repay her student loans were sooo random and completely bored me but the strong storylines of the others more than made up for this lapse.Overall I really enjoy this disc set and loved the two extras regarding the wardrobe & the production of Toni's wedding.",4,Girlfriends - Season 3,1220140800,"08 31, 2008",2008,1929,"['watched', 'few', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'GIRLFRIENDS', 'had', 'issues', 'so', 'stopped', 'watching', 'First', 'compared', 'negatively', 'then', 'cancelled', 'LIVING', 'SINGLE', 'Secondly', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'characters', 'felt', 'were', 'way', 'too', 'top', 'fake', 'Third', 'hated', 'cut-aways', 'show', 'viewers', 'Joan', 'thoughts', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'show', 'chance', 'popular', 'church', 'episode', 'Season', '2', 'aka', 'Toni', 'Joan', 'reconciliation', 'became', 'intrigued', 'what', 'fight', 'had', 'been', 'about', 'could', 'truly', 'put', 'friendship', 'back', 'together', 'therefore', 'decided', 'watch', 'entire', 'third', 'season', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'avid', 'tv', 'fan', 'should', 'know', 'now', 'sometimes', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'shows', 'can', 'be', 'sort', 'testing', 'ground', 'stick', 'initial', 'bad', 'storylines', 'get', 'know', 'love', 'characters', 'storylines', 'get', 'stronger', 'draw', 'superficial', 'level', 'loved', 'characters', 'Joan', 'Toni', 'wardrobes', 'so', 'addition', 'anticipating', 'stories', 'anticipated', 'seeing', 'what', ""'d"", 'be', 'wearing.During', 'season', 'strongest', 'storylines', 'were', 'Toni', 'relationship', 'Todd', 'William', 'relationship', 'Monica', 'Maya', 'marital', 'struggles', 'subsequent', 'single', 'status', 'hilarious', 'side', 'story', 'were', 'few', 'episodes', 'when', 'main', 'characters', 'Toni', 'were', 'living', 'Joan', 'house.The', 'negatives', 'season', 'hated', 'pairing', 'Joan', 'Ellis', 'two', 'actors', 'had', 'chemistry', 'so', 'relationship', 'was', 'very', 'boring', 'Lynn', 'entire', 'purpose', 'seemed', 'be', 'punchline', 'appearance', 'birth', 'mother', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'appearing', 'demand', 'repay', 'student', 'loans', 'were', 'sooo', 'random', 'completely', 'bored', 'strong', 'storylines', 'others', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'lapse.Overall', 'really', 'enjoy', 'disc', 'set', 'loved', 'two', 'extras', 'regarding', 'wardrobe', 'production', 'Toni', 'wedding']",Girlfriends: Season 3

It's great the way they all interact and share laughs and fights and gossip like real girlfriends do.  I feel the show keeps progressing well; not slowing down like other programmes out there.
