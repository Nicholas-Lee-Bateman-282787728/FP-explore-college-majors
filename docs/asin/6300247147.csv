225551,AZSN1TO0JI87B,6300247147,A. Estes,"[1, 2]","That lovable little rapscallion from ""The Omen)"" has returned to raise more Hell in ""Damien: Omen II"". No longer a toddler, Damien is closing in on his 13th birthday. While most pre-teens must cope with puberty and the confusion that accompanies it, Damien (portrayed by Jonathan Scott-Taylor) is more pre-occupied with his destiny, which is that of the son of the Satan, The Anti-Christ. He is now living with his Uncle and attends a military academy where he is quick to put his peers in his place and is encouraged by a sketchy teacher (the one and only Lance Henriksen!) who encourages him to read a passage in the Bible that tells him all he needs to know about himself. If only every teenager were given such guidance!The film faced an uphill battle when its original director, Mike Hodges, was swapped out for Don Taylor, but thankfully, the end results aren't as compromised as one would expect. On the contrary, ""Damien: The Omen II"" is a rather solid companion piece to the Richard Donner original, with death scenes that are every bit as ground-breaking for their time and still shocking today (all about the crow pecking out the eyeballs) and a great cast that includes William Holden, Lee Grant and Elizabeth Shepard. Scott-Taylor seems born to have played Damien, managing the dynamics of being a sympathetic character turned a bone-chilling menace quite effectively. The film may rush a bit to its ending, which is perhaps its only flaw, but on the whole, it's a worthy follow-up that is almost every bit as mean and memorable as its predecessor.",4,Surprisingly Superb Sequel,1300492800,"03 19, 2011",2011,1561,"['lovable', 'little', 'rapscallion', 'Omen', 'returned', 'raise', 'more', 'Hell', 'Damien', 'Omen', 'II', 'No', 'longer', 'toddler', 'Damien', 'closing', '13th', 'birthday', 'most', 'pre-teens', 'must', 'cope', 'puberty', 'confusion', 'Damien', 'portrayed', 'Jonathan', 'Scott-Taylor', 'more', 'pre-occupied', 'destiny', 'son', 'Satan', 'Anti-Christ', 'now', 'living', 'Uncle', 'military', 'academy', 'where', 'quick', 'put', 'peers', 'place', 'encouraged', 'sketchy', 'teacher', 'one', 'only', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'who', 'read', 'passage', 'Bible', 'know', 'only', 'teenager', 'were', 'given', 'such', 'guidance', 'film', 'faced', 'uphill', 'battle', 'when', 'original', 'director', 'Mike', 'Hodges', 'was', 'swapped', 'out', 'Don', 'Taylor', 'thankfully', 'end', 'results', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'compromised', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'contrary', 'Damien', 'Omen', 'II', 'rather', 'solid', 'companion', 'piece', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'original', 'death', 'scenes', 'are', 'bit', 'ground-breaking', 'time', 'still', 'shocking', 'today', 'crow', 'pecking', 'out', 'eyeballs', 'great', 'cast', 'William', 'Holden', 'Lee', 'Grant', 'Elizabeth', 'Shepard', 'Scott-Taylor', 'born', 'have', 'played', 'Damien', 'managing', 'dynamics', 'being', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'turned', 'bone-chilling', 'menace', 'quite', 'effectively', 'film', 'may', 'rush', 'bit', 'ending', 'perhaps', 'only', 'flaw', 'whole', 'worthy', 'follow-up', 'almost', 'bit', 'mean', 'memorable', 'predecessor']",N/A

In this sequel... the story continued on very well. Good cast and Jerry Goldsmith as usual gives a wonderfull score. 'Ave Satani' being the initial score in the film, Terrifying indeed. What I felt very much about this film was despite great charecterizations and good performence by each individual, there was still a lack of the atmosphere of horror unlike the Prequel. The film in my opinion could have been even more better, somehow.. Don Taylor did a good job. Jonathan Scott Taylor as the teenage Damien did very well, he was very expressive and so did Lucas Donat in the role of his cousin. Lee Grant, Robert Foxworth, Nicholas Pryor, Lew Ayres, William Holden and the rest others gives sattisfying performence. In other words, if you loved the Prequel ""The Omen"", you will be definately curious to watch this one as well, even though you shall certainly feel that there is some lack of horror in this Sequel as compared to the first one, but overall its still worth watching.",4,"A worthy sequel to ""The Omen""",1209859200,"05 4, 2008",2008,1106,"['have', 'seen', 'prequel', 'loved', 'very', 'much', 'even', 'today', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'years', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'film', 'sequel', 'story', 'continued', 'very', 'well', 'Good', 'cast', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'usual', 'wonderfull', 'score', 'Satani', 'being', 'initial', 'score', 'film', 'Terrifying', 'indeed', 'What', 'felt', 'very', 'much', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'charecterizations', 'good', 'performence', 'individual', 'was', 'still', 'lack', 'atmosphere', 'horror', 'Prequel', 'film', 'opinion', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'more', 'better', 'somehow..', 'Don', 'Taylor', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Jonathan', 'Scott', 'Taylor', 'teenage', 'Damien', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'was', 'very', 'expressive', 'so', 'did', 'Lucas', 'Donat', 'role', 'cousin', 'Lee', 'Grant', 'Robert', 'Foxworth', 'Nicholas', 'Pryor', 'Lew', 'Ayres', 'William', 'Holden', 'rest', 'others', 'sattisfying', 'performence', 'other', 'words', 'loved', 'Prequel', 'Omen', 'will', 'be', 'definately', 'curious', 'watch', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'shall', 'certainly', 'feel', 'lack', 'horror', 'Sequel', 'compared', 'first', 'one', 'overall', 'still', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

I almost forgot what great actors William Holden and Lee Grant were (no hidden sarcasm here). Really, these were the more memorable &quot;mature&quot; actors from the golden era of Hollywood (40's,50's,60's)that added the distinguishable touch to an otherwise regular horror/thriller flick. Jonathan Scott-Taylor was just as intense and professional for such an early age !

225556,A1PYZWEC4SCUB8,6300247147,Book N Film Fan,"[3, 3]","Damien Omen II is a decent sequel to the original Omen film, which was released in 1976. The cast is very strong and includes such well-known actors as William Holden, Lee Grant, and Robert Foxworth. Jonathan Scott-Taylor is excellent as the precocious Damien who gradually realizes his is the Devil's son.For the most part the plot traces a series of horrific deaths that pave the way for Damien to gain wealth and influence. It becomes obvious that many of the people in his life are evil, and are helping kill-off anyone who threatens Damien's rise to power. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the film is how rational, worldly people discover the truth about Damien and become unhinged.Another strong point of Damien Omen II is the cinematography.  Filmed largely outdoors, the movie captures nice views of Chicago, the Wisconsin countryside in winter, and the large estate that is owned by Damien's uncle Richard Thorn (Holden).  There are also some vividly memorable accident scenes, such as a man trapped in a falling elevator, a crow pecking a woman senseless on a deserted highway, and Lee Grant wielding some scary-looking ancient daggers.

I find this film a sacrificed ripe  possibility ruined by the heavy-handed control of unimaginative filmmakers.Though graced by another significantly brilliant Jerry Goldsmith score,  an admirably sympathetic portrayal by Jonathan Scott-Taylor, first-rate  death sequences, and an unusual look into the influence of free will upon a  child's destiny makes Damien Omen 2 a guilty pleasure that could have been  much more.

Jonathan Scott-Taylor embodies these dual personas beautifully, allowing the audience to relate to the unfortunate circumstances that surround him though they despise the growing evil that dwells within him.

But the series was not about to stop there, for the first film was just a warning of what was yet to come. In 1978, DAMIEN: OMEN II came our way and continued to scare us to death.A week after Robert and Kathy Thorn's suspicious deaths, CARL BUGENHAGEN (again played by Leo McKern) had seen some paintings and statues that gave him definite proof that the Antichrist's existence is true. He had seen pictures of Damien on this wall of paintings from the time of his birth down to his fall. He and and friend visit this wall, where they are killed.Seven years later, DAMIEN THORN (played by Jonathan Scott-Taylor) is now at the age of twelve, where he has been living with his uncle, RICHARD THORN (played by William Holden) and his wife, ANN (played by LEE GRANT). Richard is Robert Thorn's brother. Richard has a son named MARK (played by Lucas Donat). He and Damien attend a military academy.Over the course of the winter, mysterious deaths occur, such as the deaths of Richard's co-workers, BILL ATHERTON (played by Lew Ayres) and PARSIAN (played by Allan Arbus) (Richard's co-workers), AUNT MARION (played by Sylvia Sidney), JOAN HART (played by Elizabeth Shephard), and many others. Their deaths were caused since they knew of Damien's true identity and they wanted him destroyed, but Damien had done to them before they could do to him. Damien has no idea of his true identity, but he feels this evil within inside of him and does not know why.At school, Damien's class was appointed a new leader named SGT. DANIEL NEFF (played by Lance Henriksen). He informs Damien to read chapter 13 of The Book Of Revelations, where Damien learns of The Beast's number: 666. Damien finds the mark under his hair and finds that he is the son of Satan.A friend of Richard's by the name of DR. CHARLES WARREN (played by Nicholas Pryor) informs Richard of Damien's identity, where Mark overhears. The evil inside Damien takes over, forcing Damien to kill his cousin. After Mark's funeral, Charles takes Richard to the wall, prooving Damien is the Antichrist. But all this causes Charles' demise.Later that night, Ann and Richard head to the museum, with Damien following, where Richard finds the seven daggers in Charles death. Ann, for some oddball reason, jumps in front of the desk, holding the daggers. Richard beggs Ann to give him the daggers and then she did...by stabbing him and claiming that ""...I was always there for him..."" Seems as though SGT. Neff, Ann, and PAUL BEHR (played by Robert Foxworth) were all protecting Damien. But at that moment, Ann screams out Damien's name and burns to death. Well, Damien's relatives are dead, where he now seems to own everything in his family name.This sequel was not as great as its predecessor, but it was one hell of a worthy follow-up. This sequel had a lot of horror and suspense, not as much as the first film, but enough to keep the audience intrigued.

Damien, now  a very scary-looking adolescent, begins to understand his destiny while at  a military school, while his uncle (William Holden) starts to realize that  the chain of crazy deaths surrounding his company and family have a  signifigance he doesn't want to face.Omen II definitely fails in  creating a strong narrative thrust: far too much is going on, and there are  too many characters simply waiting around to be killed in another grandiose  satanic &quot;accident&quot;. Dramatically, the film is best when it  centers of Damien's experience at the school (Jonathan Scott-Taylor plays  Damien's ambivalence extremely well) and William's Holden's growing  insecurity. But the subplots about Thorn Industries never go anywhere, and  characters and ideas are introduced mere minutes before another death scene  brings them to a screeching halt.But the film does deliver on the clever  fright and gore scenes: cracked ice, runaway trains, crazy elevators  (eeeeeewwww! you'll see what I mean), and ghastly ravens accompanied by  Jerry Goldsmith's score make the flick an unpredictable wild ride. And even  if the finale doesn't build up as well as it should, there's a geuninely  shocking twist that makes it all worth while.

Despite some genuinely creepy moments they are telegraphed too soon to be wholly effective.  Even Jerry Goldsmith's score, which was a plus in the origianl, doesn't help matters.

I'm pretty sure that I would have appreciated it more had I not seen the first just a couple of months ago.  Putting aside these speculations, this is a good watchable film with a cast led by one of the redoubtable stars of the recent past, William Holden. He is ably abetted by another quite talented star of lesser magnitude and, in this case, smaller part, Lee Grant. She is somewhat at a disadvantage in that her part requires her to go over the top a couple of times. It was quite good to see Lew Ayres who adeptly plays a small role. This being a superior A production, smaller parts are ably filled as well.As to the plot, as I said, with the cumulation of two movies similarly constructed, I got a bit bored with the powers of Damien going unchecked. That doesn't fit in with my personal movie theology ( if I can label it that way) which says very emphatically (as did the Hayes/then Breen Office Code) that GOOD always triumphs over EVIL. I am simply not happy with pictures in which EVIL always has an unchallenged free hand to do as it Wills.  That's a purely personal ethos, of course, but it did make this film less palatable than might have been.In sum, this is a well made if not fine movie and  one has a chance to see again stars of the past as well as a continuation of a good story which you may have liked.

Person imminently meets with gruesome death.)It wouldn't even be worth the time to dismiss this movie were it not for a few elements of peripheral interest. There is the presence of film demi-legend William Holden, prostituting himself for booze money, but still effortlessly projecting his natural authority and charisma. There is the irresistable idea of having the Antichrist (well played, I thought, by Jonathan Taylor Thomas, who actually manages to create sympathy for the Devil) discover his calling. And there are a few memorable deaths for horror buffs, though none quite up to the standard of the first &quot;Omen&quot;.

225581,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,6300247147,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[0, 0]","Sequels have gotten a bad name over the years and deservingly so, but there are select few of horror movie sequels that just do not get the credit they deserve.  ""Damien: The Omen II"" is one of those sequels.  Most sequels, horror movies included, do not have good acting.  It seems that remakes and sequels, with very few exceptions, have poor acting and poor execution.  ""Damien: Omen II"" is a perfect example of how to do a sequel.  William Holden, one of my favorite all-time actors, stars as Richard Thorn, Damien's uncle, in this timeless horror classic.  After Robert Thorn's and his wife's untimely deaths, Damien moves in with his father's brother, Richard Thorn.  Everything seems to be fine until Damien approaches his 13th birthday.  Things start happening, Damien learns of his origin and the Beast takes no prisoners.The acting in this sequel is superb and drives home a horrifying movie-viewing experience that clearly rivals the original classic.  The kill scenes are much better than people give this movie credit for, but what really drives this film is its terrifying storyline about Satan's son incarnate and his evil purpose.  ""Damien: Omen 2"" picks up where ""The Omen"" left off, and this makes for a very smooth transition from the original film to its sequel.  Also, ""Damien: Omen 2"" intertwines itself with the original film so that much of the same flavor, mood and motif are clearly present in the sequel as it was in the original.As a side note, William Holden was originally asked to do the original, but he declined.  However, upon seeing success of the original film with Gregory Peck, Holden gladly accepted the role of Richard Thorn in the sequel. Personally, I love both Gregory Peck and William Holden, but Holden is my favorite, and he delivers a classic and powerful performance as Richard Thorn in this sequel that goes largely unappreciated by the general public.  It is one thing to dislike sequels because they are, for the most part, poorly constructed movies, but ""Damien: Omen 2"" is not one of those movies.

225587,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,6300247147,J from NY,"[3, 4]","Drawing any direct comparison between this film and Richard Donner's 1976 masterpiece is a bit unfair, especially considering that this ranks as a genuinely creepy horror movie in it's own right.  No one can ever do ""The Omen"" again.  The remake was novel and interesting, but nowhere near the macabre majesty of the original.  As ""The Omen III"" with Sam Neill proved quite painfully, it will not happen.The young Jonathan Scott Taylor is more than competent in his slightly absurd role--the Antichrist moving into adolescence almost completely unaware of his destructive role in the cosmos.  William Holden, essentially reprising the role of Gregory Peck in the original as the paternal figure who, despite mighty coincidental gruesome death after gruesome death and witnesses aplenty, cannot bring himself to believe his adopted son is the devil.Damien is ripe for mischief and is entering, predictably, military school: where he encounters more than a few sympathetic characters (Lance Henriksen is particularly chilling) who are ready to assist him in his rise to power.The scene in which Damien discovers who he is presents the most complex problem of the film.  Reading Revelations (of course) and having a little recommended Bible study with his Sergeant at Satanic HS, he shaves the back of his head and finds the mark of the beast.  Finally, he does it himself; no one has to do with dogs tearing them apart or evil nannies trying to stab them to death.  Damien is growing up.His initial reaction is one of horror.  ""Why me?"", he screams at the heavens, and indeed, why?  The only logical thing for a semi conscientious Antichrist to do at this point would be to ""help make a difference"" by throwing himself off a bridge.  But then Daddy would be most displeased, and none of us would want to deal with that.The scene in with the reporter Joan Hart is killed is unparalleled in sheer grisly horror.  Having the misfortune to see ""Bugenhagen's Wall"" which has a very clear representation of Damien's face underneath a bunch of snakes, she insists on speaking with Damien's earthly father, William Holden.  Big mistake.The real villain in this film, though, is Damien's adopted mother.  There are clearly incestuous overtones as she manically tries to convince Holden's character that all these rumors from anthropologists and scientists (watch for the elevator scene with Richard Pryor's cousin)  that the young lad is Satan himself are filthy lies.

225593,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6300247147,Lawyeraau,"[21, 22]","This sequel, released two years after the blockbuster success of ""The Omen"", is itself a stylish thriller. Featuring an excellent cast, it attempts to continue the momentum of the original. While having some shortcomings, the film, nonetheless, manages to entertain and shock. This is due in large part to its excellent cast and another chilling musical score by Jerry Goldsmith that is used to great effect.This film continues the story begun in ""The Omen"". The  Antichrist, Damien (Jonathan Scott Taylor), is here on earth and is now twelve, His parents, Katherine and Robert Thorn, now dead, and Damien is being raised by his uncle, Richard Thorn (William Holden) and his second wife, Ann (Lee Grant). He lives with them and Richard Thorn's son by his first wife, Mark (Lucas Donat). Damien is disliked by his Aunt Marion (Sylvia Sidney), who counsels the Thorns to separate Mark from Damien with whom he is close.Damien attends a militairy boarding school with his cousin Mark. There, Damien's interests are looked after by Sgt. Neff (Lance Hendricksen), a sort of earthly sentinel. There, Damien begins to flex his satanic muscles, much to the chagrin of a school bully. Meanwhile, Damien's interests in the Thorn family's multi-million dollar empire are being watched over by his uncle's highly placed executive employee, Paul Buher (Robert Foxworth), unbeknownst to his uncle. This is a man about whom Thorn's chief executive, Bill Atherton (Lew Ayres) has some serious misgivings.  When several of the people who stand in the way of Damien securing control of the family fortune meet unusual deaths, the viewer knows that Damien's true nature has been unleashed.William Holden and Lee Grant are terrific. With straightforward, sincere portrayals, they are the linchpins of this movie. Jonathan Scott Taylor is good as Damien but not particularly charismatic. Well nuanced performances are given by Richard Foxworth and Lance Hendriksen, Damien's earthly sentinels. Old timer Lew Ayres is wonderful as the ethical business man, and Sylvia Sidney is terrific as the aunt who knows that there is something wrong with Damien. Lucas Donat is excellent as Damien's cousin Mark.There is a surprising twist at the end of this film, that is sure to catch the viewer unawares. Still, that is not enough to make this sequel comparable to the original. It lacks the subtlety and deft direction of ""The Omen"". While the director, Don Taylor, does a competent job of directing this sequel, some of the scenes are heavy handed, giving in to special effects that detract from the film, rather than enhance it.The opening scene is a prime example of gratuitous excess. Here, the archaeologist, Bugenhagen, played by Leo McKern, reprising his original role in ""The Omen"", is trapped in a ruin with a friend of his, while showing him a fresco of an Antichrist that looks remarkably like Damien. As the walls come tumbling down about them, the special effects are so hokey as to be laughable. This was unnecessary, as the actors themselves were strong enough to carry the scene, had it been shot with more subtlety. Less is sometimes more, a mechanism that the original director, Richard Donner, employed to great effect.The DVD has some bonus features, such as a commentary by the producer, but is not a loaded DVD. It has clarity of picture and sound. The DVD is well worth having, however, if one is a fan of the original film upon which this sequel was predicated.",4,THE RETURN OF DAMIEN...A LITTLE OLDER...A  LITTLE WISER,1018051200,"04 6, 2002",2002,3456,"['sequel', 'released', 'two', 'years', 'blockbuster', 'success', 'Omen', 'stylish', 'thriller', 'Featuring', 'excellent', 'cast', 'continue', 'momentum', 'original', 'having', 'shortcomings', 'film', 'nonetheless', 'entertain', 'shock', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'excellent', 'cast', 'chilling', 'musical', 'score', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'used', 'great', 'effect.This', 'film', 'story', 'begun', 'Omen', 'Antichrist', 'Damien', 'Jonathan', 'Scott', 'Taylor', 'here', 'earth', 'now', 'twelve', 'parents', 'Katherine', 'Robert', 'Thorn', 'now', 'dead', 'Damien', 'being', 'raised', 'uncle', 'Richard', 'Thorn', 'William', 'Holden', 'second', 'wife', 'Ann', 'Lee', 'Grant', 'Richard', 'Thorn', 'son', 'first', 'wife', 'Mark', 'Lucas', 'Donat', 'Damien', 'disliked', 'Aunt', 'Marion', 'Sylvia', 'Sidney', 'who', 'Thorns', 'separate', 'Mark', 'Damien', 'whom', 'close.Damien', 'attends', 'militairy', 'boarding', 'school', 'cousin', 'Mark', 'Damien', 'interests', 'are', 'looked', 'Sgt', 'Neff', 'Lance', 'Hendricksen', 'sort', 'earthly', 'sentinel', 'Damien', 'flex', 'satanic', 'muscles', 'much', 'chagrin', 'school', 'bully', 'Meanwhile', 'Damien', 'interests', 'Thorn', 'family', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'empire', 'are', 'being', 'watched', 'uncle', 'highly', 'placed', 'executive', 'employee', 'Paul', 'Buher', 'Robert', 'Foxworth', 'unbeknownst', 'uncle', 'man', 'whom', 'Thorn', 'chief', 'executive', 'Bill', 'Atherton', 'Lew', 'Ayres', 'serious', 'misgivings', 'When', 'several', 'people', 'who', 'stand', 'way', 'Damien', 'securing', 'control', 'family', 'meet', 'unusual', 'deaths', 'viewer', 'Damien', 'true', 'nature', 'been', 'unleashed.William', 'Holden', 'Lee', 'Grant', 'are', 'terrific', 'straightforward', 'sincere', 'portrayals', 'are', 'linchpins', 'movie', 'Jonathan', 'Scott', 'Taylor', 'good', 'Damien', 'not', 'particularly', 'charismatic', 'Well', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'are', 'given', 'Richard', 'Foxworth', 'Lance', 'Hendriksen', 'Damien', 'earthly', 'sentinels', 'Old', 'timer', 'Lew', 'Ayres', 'wonderful', 'ethical', 'business', 'man', 'Sylvia', 'Sidney', 'terrific', 'aunt', 'who', 'something', 'wrong', 'Damien', 'Lucas', 'Donat', 'excellent', 'Damien', 'cousin', 'Mark.There', 'surprising', 'twist', 'end', 'film', 'sure', 'catch', 'viewer', 'unawares', 'Still', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'sequel', 'comparable', 'original', 'subtlety', 'deft', 'direction', 'Omen', 'director', 'Don', 'Taylor', 'competent', 'job', 'directing', 'sequel', 'scenes', 'are', 'heavy', 'handed', 'giving', 'special', 'effects', 'detract', 'film', 'rather', 'enhance', 'it.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'prime', 'example', 'gratuitous', 'excess', 'Here', 'archaeologist', 'Bugenhagen', 'played', 'Leo', 'McKern', 'reprising', 'original', 'role', 'Omen', 'trapped', 'ruin', 'friend', 'showing', 'fresco', 'Antichrist', 'remarkably', 'like', 'Damien', 'walls', 'come', 'tumbling', 'down', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'so', 'hokey', 'be', 'laughable', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'actors', 'were', 'strong', 'enough', 'carry', 'scene', 'had', 'been', 'shot', 'more', 'subtlety', 'Less', 'sometimes', 'more', 'mechanism', 'original', 'director', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'employed', 'great', 'effect.The', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', 'such', 'commentary', 'producer', 'not', 'loaded', 'DVD', 'clarity', 'picture', 'sound', 'DVD', 'well', 'worth', 'having', 'however', 'one', 'fan', 'original', 'film', 'sequel', 'was', 'predicated']",N/A

225598,A2E9TRM8096BXU,6300247147,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[4, 5]","This is one underrated and sadly neglected horror movie, and that makes me angry, because I honestly feel that not only is it a good movie in its own right, it is also the best of the OMEN trilogy.Yes, I said it - this film is better than the legendary (and infamous) original, and certainly better than its underwhelming third act. It's a very finished, professional piece of work, with a solid script, a talent-laden cast, lush cinematography, a terrific score, and some of the ghastliest killings you'll ever see. It's hardly perfect, but it does precisely what it sets out to do, and it does it with style and - I think this is the right description - a kind of tragic efficiency.In the first movie, the U.S. Ambassador to Britain and a potential presidential candidate, Andrew Thorn (Gregory Peck) discovers that the son he illictly adopted is actually the Antichrist, predicted by the Book of Revelations to usher in armageddeon. Thorn, however, is killed (along with his wife) before he can slay five year-old Damien, and the film ends with the chilling image of Damien attending his ""parents"" funeral while standing hand-in-hand with the President of the United States. Part II picks up more or less where the old one left off, with the now twelve year-old Damien (Johnathan Scott-Taylor) happily living with Thorn's rich-industrialist brother Richard (played by William Holden) and his family outside Chicago. Alas, happiness is about to end for everyone involved, for as one character remarks, ""It's time for you to put away childish things, Damien, and embrace your destiny.""Without giving away the candy store, PART II's plot breaks down into several stories. The first is the story of Damien himself - how he comes to understand his true identity as Satan's instrument on earth, and what he does with the knowledge. The second is the story of what might be called ""the Resistance"" - the extremely persistent and even more extremely unfortunate people who set themselves against Damien and are done in by Satan (in the form of ""accidents"") as a result. The third, tying into the first, is the attempts by the devil's agents (Lance Henriksen and Robert Foxworthy, and a third whose identity I can't reveal) to guide Damien towards his destiny. Lastly it is the story of Richard Thorn, who like his brother is not exactly eager to accept that the child he has been raising these last seven years, and which he views as a second son, is actually the Antichrist. Like the original, he's faced with the most horrific question imaginable: What do you do when you realize you're supposed to kill someone you love?DAMIEN has some strengths the original film could not have - could not, because in that film, Damien is first an infant, then a toddler, and finally a very small boy, only five years old. Except for the notorious ""tricycle scene"" in which he sends his mother over a balcony railing, the boy himself has little to do in the movie - all the mayhem is caused by Satan, or by human agents acting on his behalf. In this movie, Damien is actually a character, and a tragic one at that, for while the film does much less than it should in exploring his internal struggle, it does show some of the anguish he feels when his true identity is finally revealed to him, as well as the choice he eventually has to make in regards to his human family. In the second place, it truly takes the gloves off in the violence department. The body count in Part I was five. In Part II, two characters are buried alive, one has her eyes ripped out by crows and is then struck down by an eighteen-wheeler, one is drowned beneath a frozen lake, one cut in two by an elevator cable, and one impaled on the magnetic coupling of a freight car. Throw in a heart attack, a pair of gassings, an immolation, a stabbing and a rather drawn-out Satan-induced anyuerism, and you have as many corpses as are produced by your average ""Friday the 13th"" film - the difference being better actors for victims and more imaginative deaths. There are even a couple instances of wicked foreshadowing.Of course this isn't a perfect film. As I noted, Damien's internal struggle - knowing who I am, do I choose to embrace my destiny or reject it? - is not explored to the degree it should have been, and as a result, Damien's personality transition - specifically, how he deals with the rest of his family, especially at the very end - seems rushed and somewhat unnatural. The film ends on a less decisive note than it might have, and probably there are too many killings for the dramatic elements of the movie to be taken seriously. None of this matters too much.

225610,A1J1163Q56YIVZ,6300247147,Shaun Anderson,"[1, 3]","As a film in its own right, Damien: Omen II is a somewhat desultory and stagnant affair. A laconic pace isn't helped by fairly uninspired acting and direction, although Jerry Goldsmith once again produces a memorable score. As a sequel to a very successful horror film however this film isn't too bad at all. Every horror fan by now knows the curse of the sequel and although Damien: Omen II is nowhere near as good as its predecessor it still has a lot going for it. Where it really excels is in its particularly imaginative set pieces, which I won't spoil here. Also like most decent modern horror films it has more to say than simply revelling in cathartic acts of violence. In the first film Damien is linked to the political arena, now he makes the shift towards the very heart of capitalist America; big business. Considering this is a Hollywood production it's quite amusing to see Damien rise to power through capitalism and consumerism, the very tools by which Hollywood and America are founded on. The natural connotation of this is that capitalism is satanic, a great plague spreading it's way across the world.There is definitely some value to this sequel, which is incredibly rare for the horror genre, however the film does suffer from a somewhat flat and colourless quality and has the overall appearance of a made for TV movie.",3,The Son of a Jackal,1162166400,"10 30, 2006",2006,1343,"['film', 'own', 'right', 'Damien', 'Omen', 'II', 'somewhat', 'desultory', 'stagnant', 'affair', 'laconic', 'pace', ""n't"", 'helped', 'fairly', 'uninspired', 'acting', 'direction', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'once', 'again', 'memorable', 'score', 'sequel', 'very', 'successful', 'horror', 'film', 'however', 'film', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'Every', 'horror', 'fan', 'now', 'curse', 'sequel', 'Damien', 'Omen', 'II', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'predecessor', 'still', 'lot', 'going', 'Where', 'really', 'particularly', 'imaginative', 'set', 'pieces', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'here', 'Also', 'most', 'decent', 'modern', 'horror', 'films', 'more', 'say', 'simply', 'revelling', 'cathartic', 'acts', 'violence', 'first', 'film', 'Damien', 'linked', 'political', 'arena', 'now', 'shift', 'very', 'heart', 'capitalist', 'America', 'big', 'business', 'Considering', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'quite', 'amusing', 'see', 'Damien', 'rise', 'power', 'capitalism', 'consumerism', 'very', 'tools', 'Hollywood', 'America', 'are', 'founded', 'natural', 'connotation', 'capitalism', 'satanic', 'great', 'plague', 'spreading', 'way', 'world.There', 'definitely', 'value', 'sequel', 'incredibly', 'rare', 'horror', 'genre', 'however', 'film', 'suffer', 'somewhat', 'flat', 'colourless', 'quality', 'overall', 'appearance', 'made', 'TV', 'movie']",N/A

Meanwhile, folks are coming out of the woodwork to warn Richard Thorne (William Holden) that he and his wife are in danger, but anyone who so much as hints that Damien is the son of Satan gets offed--quickly and nastily.  Some scenes are truly creepy; there's one scene that looks like an outtake of ""the Birds,"" only this time it's more gory.  But by far the most intense scene is the ""confrontation"" between Damian and his cousin Mark, who finds out who he really is.

225616,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,6300247147,the masked reviewer,"[2, 2]","When we took our leave of him at the end of The Omen, Damien, the cherubic-looking Antichrist, come to earth to claim his rights, was 6 years old and in attendance at the state funeral of his father and mother, the recently deceased United States Ambassador to the Court of St. James's and Mrs. Thorn. Holding the hand of the President throughout the ceremony, Damien did not fidget. Apparently fidgets are not something to which a child ""born unto a jackal"" is subject.At the start of Damien - Omen II, the inevitable sequel, we leap seven years into the future when Damien, now 13 and played by round-faced Jonathan Scott-Taylor, is living near Chicago with his uncle, Richard Thorn (William Holden), Richard's wife, Ann (Lee Grant), and his cousin Mark (Lucas Donat) in the sort of suburban splendor that only multimillions can buy in the Middle West: a 50-year-old, mock French chateau and more liveried servants than you're likely to find at Buckingham Palace.To all outward appearances Damien is, if not the Anti-christ, then at least an Antichrist. He rarely smiles, and when he does it's a sneer. He's rude to his ancient aunt. He smokes, and when crossed by a schoolmate, all he has to do is stare to send the other kid into convulsions. Yet nobody recognizes him for what he is, not even Damien himself.It's left to a sergeant at the military school attended by Damien and Mark to pass the word on to Damien. The sergeant is one of the Devil's helpers who miraculously appear from time to time to help Damien (and the movie's plot) along. ""The time is coming,"" he says sternly, ""for you to put away childish things and face up to who you are."" Those of us who endured The Omen know what the sergeant means: ""You're too old to go around murdering mummies and daddies and nannies. Act your age.""One way or another Damien does, and Omen II is the open-ended record of this particular -what should we call it?-rite of passage. Before Damien is finished this time, there have been approximately a dozen new victims, a couple of whom have succumbed to what appear to be internal disorders while others have been sliced in half, stabbed, burned, impaled, gassed, pecked (by a nasty crow) and, in the film's most inspired moment of cinematic cheese, drowned beneath the clear ice of a lake.As foolish as it is, Damien - Omen II is fun to watch and rather stylish-looking. Much of the film was shot in and around Chicago, which, in winter, with its extraordinary architecture, must be one of the handsomest of American cities. (Although ""Damien"" does have trouble getting its seasons straight. While the story covers approximately nine months, the leaves on the trees suggest a perpetual autumn with occasional bouts of winter.) Still, the winter scenes are spectacular, and work subliminally to counter the many comic absurdities of the screenplay.We'd hate to have anyone watch ""Damien"" with the idea that it's going to be some sort of transcendental experience. It's a joke, but as such jokes go, it's much funnier than Brian DePalma's The Fury (1978), and just as shrewd in its Grand Guignol special effects.",5,A Grand Guignol Hoot!,1199577600,"01 6, 2008",2008,3113,"['When', 'took', 'leave', 'end', 'Omen', 'Damien', 'cherubic-looking', 'Antichrist', 'come', 'earth', 'claim', 'rights', 'was', '6', 'years', 'old', 'attendance', 'state', 'funeral', 'father', 'mother', 'recently', 'deceased', 'United', 'States', 'Ambassador', 'Court', 'St.', 'James', 'Mrs.', 'Thorn', 'Holding', 'hand', 'President', 'ceremony', 'Damien', 'did', 'not', 'fidget', 'Apparently', 'fidgets', 'are', 'not', 'something', 'child', 'born', 'jackal', 'start', 'Damien', 'Omen', 'II', 'inevitable', 'sequel', 'leap', 'seven', 'years', 'future', 'when', 'Damien', 'now', '13', 'played', 'round-faced', 'Jonathan', 'Scott-Taylor', 'living', 'Chicago', 'uncle', 'Richard', 'Thorn', 'William', 'Holden', 'Richard', 'wife', 'Ann', 'Lee', 'Grant', 'cousin', 'Mark', 'Lucas', 'Donat', 'sort', 'suburban', 'splendor', 'only', 'multimillions', 'can', 'buy', 'Middle', 'West', '50-year-old', 'mock', 'French', 'chateau', 'more', 'liveried', 'servants', ""'re"", 'likely', 'find', 'Buckingham', 'Palace.To', 'outward', 'appearances', 'Damien', 'not', 'Anti-christ', 'then', 'least', 'Antichrist', 'rarely', 'when', 'sneer', 'rude', 'ancient', 'aunt', 'when', 'crossed', 'schoolmate', 'do', 'stare', 'send', 'other', 'kid', 'convulsions', 'nobody', 'what', 'not', 'even', 'Damien', 'himself.It', 'left', 'sergeant', 'military', 'school', 'attended', 'Damien', 'Mark', 'pass', 'word', 'Damien', 'sergeant', 'one', 'Devil', 'helpers', 'who', 'miraculously', 'appear', 'time', 'time', 'help', 'Damien', 'movie', 'plot', 'along', 'time', 'coming', 'sternly', 'put', 'away', 'childish', 'things', 'face', 'up', 'who', 'are', 'who', 'endured', 'Omen', 'know', 'what', 'sergeant', ""'re"", 'too', 'old', 'go', 'around', 'murdering', 'mummies', 'daddies', 'nannies', 'Act', 'age', 'One', 'way', 'Damien', 'Omen', 'II', 'open-ended', 'record', 'particular', 'should', 'call', '-rite', 'passage', 'Damien', 'finished', 'time', 'have', 'been', 'approximately', 'dozen', 'new', 'victims', 'couple', 'whom', 'have', 'succumbed', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'internal', 'disorders', 'others', 'have', 'been', 'sliced', 'half', 'stabbed', 'burned', 'impaled', 'gassed', 'pecked', 'nasty', 'crow', 'film', 'most', 'inspired', 'moment', 'cinematic', 'cheese', 'drowned', 'clear', 'ice', 'lake.As', 'foolish', 'Damien', 'Omen', 'II', 'fun', 'watch', 'rather', 'stylish-looking', 'Much', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Chicago', 'winter', 'extraordinary', 'architecture', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'handsomest', 'American', 'cities', 'Damien', 'have', 'trouble', 'getting', 'seasons', 'straight', 'story', 'approximately', 'nine', 'months', 'leaves', 'trees', 'suggest', 'perpetual', 'autumn', 'occasional', 'bouts', 'winter', 'Still', 'winter', 'scenes', 'are', 'spectacular', 'work', 'subliminally', 'counter', 'many', 'comic', 'absurdities', 'screenplay.We', ""'d"", 'hate', 'have', 'anyone', 'watch', 'Damien', 'idea', 'going', 'be', 'sort', 'transcendental', 'experience', 'joke', 'such', 'jokes', 'go', 'much', 'funnier', 'Brian', 'DePalma', 'Fury', '1978', 'just', 'shrewd', 'Grand', 'Guignol', 'special', 'effects']",N/A
