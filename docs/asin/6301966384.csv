277036,A1A6K6KF7A5IMU,6301966384,"""antonfurst""","[11, 12]","This is the original frightfest that my sister and nephew bragged about sooo many years ago about. That was 1982 folks! i purchased this dvd a couple of years back just because i thought of them. I remember all the chats about how horrible the scary parts were. well, it was laughable now but i bet really gross then? this is the kinda flick designed to keep you company on a lonely Friday or Saturday night folks! the story involves a woman who had been raped one night and eventually got pregnant from her attacker...a weird bug cicada creature. The reason for the attack stemmed from him wanting to secure his revenge on his enemies. Only by returning via his offspring can he carry about his malevolent plan. Cicadas sleep under the earth for 17 years and then return in the summer to eat and spawn and that's the basis of the creature in this flick. Unfortunately for his son life will be shortlived and rather ugly since he never gets to live out his dreams, love his girlfriend nor get out of such a boring town? Just where in the world is this town anyway? The directors and creators of this wacky freight fest state that &quot;absolutely no one will be able to widthstand the last few minutes of this film!&quot; Well, I did and it was nice to see a shoe string budget horror flick be both gross and disturbing while still maintaining a somewhat cohesive plot? There are no REAl stars but it did include actor Meshach Taylor (from Designing Women fame) who plays a minimal part in this wacky fest. I recommend this weird movie to all of you who enjoy cheesy horror movies and the like. I just wish the plot would have been a little better but that's ok. I just wanted to know why Meshach always played bit parts in horror flicks? At least he didn't get split in half like he did in THE OMEN 2.

277041,AUDIJM3VUULS7,6301966384,Charles Tatum,"[9, 20]","It is always sad to see name actors reduced to taking icky gross horror films just to pay a mortgage. Ronny Cox and L.Q. Jones are very good here, and Meshach Taylor looks the same here as he does now, almost twenty years later...hey, that is the creepiest thing about this film.Two newlyweds in 1965 get stuck on a lonely highway in Mississippi, and the guy walks back up the highway for help. A monster happens by, as they often do, kills the dog, and rapes the new bride. Seventeen years later, the offspring son of that rape is having medical problems, and the now older married couple make like Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys Mysteries, going back to the small town near where she was attacked, hoping to find clues as to who the raping father was. The son follows, develops a thirst for blood (as one is wont to do in the backwater southern U.S.), and attacks people related to a murder from years before. At this point, I began to lose track of most of the names of characters and the stereotypical rubes they trot out just because this is how Hollywood thinks people from the south act. You would think Cox would have learned his lesson after ""Deliverance."" Eventually, we find out the bride was attacked by the local chained up cannibal, who somehow has been reincarnated in its offspring's body. Gore and mayhem soon follow.There are incredible leaps in logic here that are never explained. How does the son know to follow the parents to the small town? Why does Cox get to ride with the cops and basically have his run of things? At one point, a character asks the same question, and he is never answered either. How did the creature get the power to take over the identity of his son, shedding his offspring's skin like a snake? Why does the creature resemble a giant brown Pillsbury dough boy, covered in sugary glaze? We probably will never know.The film has a good, expensive look to it, but we are treated to a rube who slaps his teenage girl around, not one but TWO scenes of the creature raping women he finds passed out in the woods, and one of the longest transformation scenes ever put on film. I am surprised no cast member checked their watch as they watched the teenage son turn into the raping, human flesh eating creature. Everyone just stands, stares, and gasps. An abrupt ending is just the slime on the cake of one icky film. ""The Beast Within"" is without merit. I do not recommend it.This is rated (R) for physical violence, gun violence, sexual violence, strong gore, profanity, female nudity, some sexual content, and adult situations.",1,Philippe Mora's The Beast Within,1023148800,"06 4, 2002",2002,2566,"['always', 'sad', 'see', 'name', 'actors', 'reduced', 'taking', 'icky', 'gross', 'horror', 'films', 'just', 'pay', 'mortgage', 'Ronny', 'Cox', 'L.Q', 'Jones', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'Meshach', 'Taylor', 'same', 'here', 'now', 'almost', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'hey', 'creepiest', 'thing', 'film.Two', '1965', 'get', 'stuck', 'lonely', 'highway', 'Mississippi', 'guy', 'walks', 'back', 'up', 'highway', 'help', 'monster', 'happens', 'often', 'do', 'kills', 'dog', 'new', 'bride', 'Seventeen', 'years', 'later', 'offspring', 'son', 'rape', 'having', 'medical', 'problems', 'now', 'older', 'married', 'couple', 'make', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'Hardy', 'Boys', 'Mysteries', 'going', 'back', 'small', 'town', 'where', 'was', 'attacked', 'hoping', 'find', 'clues', 'who', 'raping', 'father', 'was', 'son', 'thirst', 'blood', 'one', 'wont', 'do', 'backwater', 'southern', 'U.S.', 'attacks', 'people', 'related', 'murder', 'years', 'before', 'point', 'began', 'lose', 'track', 'most', 'names', 'characters', 'stereotypical', 'rubes', 'trot', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'people', 'south', 'act', 'would', 'think', 'Cox', 'would', 'have', 'learned', 'lesson', 'Deliverance', 'Eventually', 'find', 'out', 'bride', 'was', 'attacked', 'local', 'chained', 'up', 'cannibal', 'who', 'somehow', 'been', 'reincarnated', 'offspring', 'body', 'Gore', 'mayhem', 'soon', 'are', 'incredible', 'leaps', 'logic', 'here', 'are', 'never', 'explained', 'How', 'son', 'know', 'follow', 'parents', 'small', 'town', 'Why', 'Cox', 'get', 'ride', 'cops', 'basically', 'have', 'run', 'things', 'one', 'point', 'character', 'same', 'question', 'never', 'answered', 'either', 'How', 'did', 'creature', 'get', 'power', 'take', 'over', 'identity', 'son', 'shedding', 'offspring', 'skin', 'snake', 'Why', 'creature', 'resemble', 'giant', 'brown', 'Pillsbury', 'dough', 'boy', 'covered', 'sugary', 'glaze', 'probably', 'will', 'never', 'know.The', 'film', 'good', 'expensive', 'look', 'are', 'treated', 'rube', 'who', 'teenage', 'girl', 'around', 'not', 'one', 'TWO', 'scenes', 'creature', 'raping', 'women', 'passed', 'out', 'woods', 'one', 'longest', 'transformation', 'scenes', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'am', 'surprised', 'cast', 'member', 'checked', 'watch', 'watched', 'teenage', 'son', 'turn', 'raping', 'human', 'flesh', 'eating', 'creature', 'Everyone', 'just', 'stares', 'gasps', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'just', 'slime', 'cake', 'one', 'icky', 'film', 'Beast', 'Within', 'merit', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'it.This', 'rated', 'R', 'physical', 'violence', 'gun', 'violence', 'sexual', 'violence', 'strong', 'gore', 'profanity', 'female', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'content', 'adult', 'situations']",N/A

In order to save their son, they are determined to discover the identity of his biological father.Meanwhile, Michael is having strange visions of a man beast chained in the cellar of an abandoned house.

""The Beast Within"" is a great hybrid of both genres.  It reminded me of Dario Argento's ""Phenomenon"" (a.k.a. ""Creepers"") where a young girl can communicate with insects.  Michael supposedly has this same power but the viewer is never shown evidence of it.""The Beast Within"" has plenty of gore but not too much.  It doesn't overwhelm the plot.  A memorable transformation scene occurs in the hospital where Michael finally turns into the insect-like creature that has been waiting to burst out of him.The ending is very downbeat.  There could've been a sequel but one was never made.  The viewer can only assume that the seventeen year cycle of revenge continues.  Unfortunately, the MGM DVD doesn't offer any special features (such as interviews or commentaries) that could answer our questions.""The Beast Within"" is a great monster movie.

Leaving his wife with the car, Eli hikes off to find a tow truck. While he's gone, a mysterious creature attacks and rapes Caroline. Upon returning, Eli rushes his wife to the hospital. Seventeen years pass. Caroline bore her rapist's child and she and Eli have raised the boy, Michael, as their own. But now Michael is suffering some inexplicable health problems his doctor can't explain. Whatever it is he's got, it's genetic.Eli and Caroline decide that their only hope for a cure is to find Michael's biological father: Caroline's rapist. They head back to the town where she was raped and begin asking around about violent crime. All they can find is a newspaper clipping about the notorious Lionel Curwin's house burning down. Nearly everyone in town is related to Lionel, and all of them are rude and openly hostile to the couple.The only person who is at all nice to them is Sheriff Bill Pool, who isn't related to the Curwins. He explains that Lionel was a very unpleasant man who had a rocky relationship with another local, Billy Connors, who disappeared.Meanwhile, Michael escapes from his hometown hospital and on some impulse drives to the town where he kills and partially eats the Curwin who runs the local paper. He is found and his parents take him to the local doctor, Dr. Schoonmaker, who pronounces that Michael has somehow gotten better! Or so it seems. Something is growing inside of Michael, something that hates the entire Curwin family and wants to destroy them.The Beast Within is an excellent little horror film, based on a novel by Edward Levy. The plot, involving a pregnancy with a monstrous origin resulting in a seemingly normal but still unusual child, and the small town conspiracy to keep the crimes of the Curwin family a secret are all quite Lovecraftian in nature.On a note of parenthood, I liked how Eli accepts Michael as his son even though he isn't. I expected him to despise Michael and see him as living evidence of his wife's rape. Instead, Eli loves Michael and is willing to do whatever it takes to try and find out what is happening to him. Caroline likewise loves Michael dearly despite how he was conceived.The cast is amazing. Ronny Cox as Eli is warm and appropriately fatherly. Bibi Besch as Caroline is also quite good, playing a very strong woman who doesn't let her traumatic rape haunt her. Special mention should also go to L.Q. Jones as the helpful and sympathetic Sheriff Pool, and especially R.G. Armstrong, who delivers an excellent performance as the kind and gentle Dr. Schoonmaker.Really, the only dud in the cast is Paul Clemens as Michael. He's just bland and has little to do except growl and snarl. The script is partially to blame here, as we don't get a chance to know Michael at all. The first time we meet him, he's lying in a hospital bed. This is not a good way to introduce your protagonist if you expect the audience to care about him!Despite this, The Beast Within succeeds and is very interesting. And no review would be complete without mentioning the special effects. When what is happening to Michael reaches its zenith, he undergoes a horrifying transformation that is definitely the highlight of the proceedings.On the downside, this being a 2001 DVD, there aren't any special features.",5,Sometimes puberty can be dangerous!,1313280000,"08 14, 2011",2011,3402,"['Eli', 'Caroline', 'MacCleary', 'are', 'honeymoon', 'driving', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'Mississippi', 'when', 'car', 'flat', 'Leaving', 'wife', 'car', 'Eli', 'find', 'tow', 'truck', 'gone', 'mysterious', 'creature', 'attacks', 'rapes', 'Caroline', 'returning', 'Eli', 'wife', 'hospital', 'Seventeen', 'years', 'pass', 'Caroline', 'rapist', 'child', 'Eli', 'have', 'raised', 'boy', 'Michael', 'own', 'now', 'Michael', 'suffering', 'inexplicable', 'health', 'problems', 'doctor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'Whatever', 'got', 'genetic.Eli', 'Caroline', 'decide', 'only', 'hope', 'cure', 'find', 'Michael', 'biological', 'father', 'Caroline', 'rapist', 'head', 'back', 'town', 'where', 'was', 'raped', 'begin', 'asking', 'violent', 'crime', 'can', 'find', 'newspaper', 'clipping', 'notorious', 'Lionel', 'Curwin', 'house', 'burning', 'down', 'Nearly', 'everyone', 'town', 'related', 'Lionel', 'are', 'rude', 'openly', 'hostile', 'couple.The', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'nice', 'Sheriff', 'Bill', 'Pool', 'who', ""n't"", 'related', 'Curwins', 'Lionel', 'was', 'very', 'unpleasant', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'local', 'Billy', 'Connors', 'who', 'disappeared.Meanwhile', 'Michael', 'hometown', 'hospital', 'impulse', 'drives', 'town', 'where', 'partially', 'Curwin', 'who', 'local', 'paper', 'found', 'parents', 'take', 'local', 'doctor', 'Dr.', 'Schoonmaker', 'who', 'Michael', 'somehow', 'gotten', 'better', 'Something', 'growing', 'Michael', 'something', 'entire', 'Curwin', 'family', 'destroy', 'them.The', 'Beast', 'Within', 'excellent', 'little', 'horror', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'Edward', 'Levy', 'plot', 'involving', 'pregnancy', 'monstrous', 'origin', 'resulting', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'still', 'unusual', 'child', 'small', 'town', 'conspiracy', 'keep', 'crimes', 'Curwin', 'family', 'secret', 'are', 'quite', 'Lovecraftian', 'note', 'parenthood', 'liked', 'how', 'Eli', 'Michael', 'son', 'even', ""n't"", 'expected', 'despise', 'Michael', 'see', 'living', 'evidence', 'wife', 'rape', 'Instead', 'Eli', 'Michael', 'willing', 'do', 'whatever', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happening', 'Caroline', 'likewise', 'Michael', 'dearly', 'how', 'was', 'conceived.The', 'cast', 'amazing', 'Ronny', 'Cox', 'Eli', 'warm', 'appropriately', 'fatherly', 'Bibi', 'Besch', 'Caroline', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'playing', 'very', 'strong', 'woman', 'who', ""n't"", 'let', 'traumatic', 'rape', 'haunt', 'Special', 'mention', 'should', 'also', 'go', 'L.Q', 'Jones', 'helpful', 'sympathetic', 'Sheriff', 'Pool', 'especially', 'R.G', 'Armstrong', 'who', 'excellent', 'performance', 'kind', 'gentle', 'Dr.', 'Schoonmaker.Really', 'only', 'dud', 'cast', 'Paul', 'Clemens', 'Michael', 'just', 'bland', 'little', 'do', 'growl', 'snarl', 'script', 'partially', 'blame', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'know', 'Michael', 'first', 'time', 'meet', 'lying', 'hospital', 'bed', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'introduce', 'protagonist', 'expect', 'audience', 'care', 'Beast', 'Within', 'very', 'interesting', 'review', 'would', 'be', 'complete', 'mentioning', 'special', 'effects', 'When', 'what', 'happening', 'Michael', 'zenith', 'horrifying', 'transformation', 'definitely', 'highlight', 'proceedings.On', 'downside', 'being', '2001', 'DVD', 'are', ""n't"", 'special', 'features']",N/A

My sister was forced to babysit me on her date night, so she and her boyfriend took me to the theater to watch this. She knew that my mom would have to deal with the nightmares afterwards, and thought that it would be hilarious. Growing up in rural Louisiana, I was scared for months afterwards. And I was freaked out by crickets and cicadas for years after that.The story, if you havent already seen or heard of it, involves a young man struggling with his own identity as his true past and parentage comes to light. A lot of the picture sets the tone for small-town unity, corruption and revenge. The most effective scene for me was when Michael is going through his first full transformation and a 14-inch tongue whips out of his mouth, then lashes back and forth, striking people. Sadly, that scene is cut short in this release. There were also some slight editing blunders. Still, this low-budget horror movie was among the pioneers of using bladders in special effects. I've owned the MGM Midnight Movies VHS, but this is the first time I've owned it in a hi-def format.This edition looks and sounds great for its age. The special features aren't much to boast about. The many radio spots are mostly identical, with only a few seconds' difference between them. The original trailer is there, but it doesn't look like its been cleaned up much.

They are not zombies though , even though some of them take a number of bullets to kill them, but that's what happens to people on meth, or pcp so that's plausible all the way.

277063,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6301966384,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 13]","The Beast Within (Phillippe Mora, 1982)I have been a huge fan of Edward Levy's two novels since they originally came out. Thus, when a film version of The Beast Within appeared not long after the novel, I was thrilled. As I was still underage at the time, I had to wait until it popped up on video to actually see it, however. I remember being disappointed that the beginning of Levy's book didn't make it into the film, but that's about it.That was twenty years ago, and I just watched The Beast Within again to see if I'd overlooked anything the first time around. I did. I overlooked how awful the whole movie is.Mora began his career with two very well-received documentaries before turning his attention to fictional subjects. His first big-screen drama, Mad Dog Morgan, has its defenders. The Beast Within was his next movie, and from that point on, I don't think he's made a single film defended by anyone but studio execs looking for a quick buck. In this version of the story (cf. my review of Levy's novel for what this is really supposed to be about), we open with something raping a newlywed. Cut to seventeen years later, when the son of said something and said newlywed is dying of an undisclosed pituitary gland problem. Except that when he gets out of the hospital and drinks blood, he gets temporarily better. (No, since I know that's what you're thinking, this isn't a vampire movie. It's something far, far stupider.)All of the plausibility that Levy puts into the first fifty pages of the novel (which are condensed into a monologue at the beginning of the film, with time changes that make it utterly unbelievable) is missing. All of the tension of the book's scenario has been erased by the elimination of one of the book's main characters and a complete change of relationship for the remaining two. The book's thoroughly cheesy, thoroughly wonderful ending has been utterly abandoned. The script for this (which was written by Tom Holland, also responsible for such script classics as Psycho II, Cloak and Dagger, and The Langoliers) may have remotely resembled the book in the first draft, but by the time it got to the filming stage, it was a completely different beast. (There is a meditation to be made on the metatheatrical aspects of the script as parallel to the main character, but the movie disgusts me to the point where I'm not willing to be the one to write it.)Given that, the film has to be looked at as a completely separate entity from the book. Is it any good if you slice off Edward Levy's name? Absolutely not. The highly-touted special effects are so fake as to be funny (though some of them you'll recognize from later films, which makes me wonder if there was some sort of influence stemming from this, as scary as the idea is). The story is a basic rehash of a number of different movies. It COULD have been done well (in fact, Harry Bromley Davenport would take a good deal of this material, stick it into a sci-fi framework, add some pieces of its contemporary E.T., and come up with the brilliant XTRO a year later). But it's impossible to watch this film, even if you're not a filmmaker yourself, and see hundreds of places where Mora could have done better with camerawork, editing, lighting, or any of another twenty or so aspects of directing a movie. Otherwise good actors like Don Gordon (Papillon, The Final Conflict), L. Q. Jones (The Virginian), and Luke Askew (South of Heaven, West of Hell) are wasted in oceans of overacting.If you're a fan of Edward Levy's wonderful novel, I suggest you forget this movie exists.

277064,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,6301966384,Robert I. Hedges,"[2, 2]","""The Beast Within"" is representative of the 1980's monster-inside-a-man horror genre, although the film is the only one I can think of revolving around the life cycle of the cicada. The quick version is this: Eli and Caroline MacCleary (Ronny Cox and Bibi Besch) run off a country road at night. Caroline is pulled into the woods and a giant cicada beast mates with her while her husband is away. Nine months later she delivers a healthy boy, Michael (Paul Clemens,) who lives the first seventeen years of his life fairly normally. Cicadas are on a seventeen year life cycle and so is Michael, who was conceived as a horrible act of vengeance. Even though the details are summarized by Judge Curwin (Don Gordon) at the end of the film, the plot is still fairly confusing, especially since the first half of the film is lethargically paced, making it easy for the mind to wander. Michael is possessed by a spirit making him seek to destroy the entire Curwin clan, and he does so quite efficiently, pausing only to fall for Amanda Platt (Kitty Moffat), herself a Curwin and daughter of the biggest lunatic (and double murderer) you have ever seen.Michael is admitted to the hospital where the local doctor doesn't know what to make of him. Still the killings continue, and get more creative (""He's been embalmed alive!"") The film is way over the top, especially in scenes like the electrocution of the local town drunk, and the frenetic atmosphere is fronted foremost by Clemens, who could easily found an organization called ""Overactors Anonymous,"" as he routinely chews the scenery and comes back for more ham. There are many distasteful things in the film, some related to the gore content (which, while significant, is tame by today's slasher movie norms,) with others just plain nasty. In the latter category I definitely put the ""vampirism plate lunch special"" scene after Amanda cuts herself with a paring knife. It's just creepy and revolting (and not in a good way.)Michael tries to kill himself by throwing himself out of Amanda's window, but unfortunately he lives. He asks Sheriff Pool (L. Q. Jones) to investigate Lionel Curwin's root cellar, and sure enough, they find the skeleton of the former cannibal who now possesses Michael. The backstory is extremely complicated and requires an undue amount of attention, even when Judge Curwin methodically explains it. It involves affairs, murder, imprisonment, cadaver cannibalism, unethical undertakers, a massive coverup engineered by the Judge himself, vengeance, and general insanity. I paid close attention and went back and watched several parts of it a second time, and I am still not entirely satisfied I understand all the convolutions required to get fully up to speed on the plot.Amid the frequent sounds of cicadas, Michael gets worse and worse, first losing his youthful looks, and gaining scary darkened eyes, all of which culminates in the hospital when he fully transforms into a hideous monster. The monster gets more and more ridiculous looking as time goes on, and even sheds his skin at one point (like cicadas do) before becoming the horrible cicada monster himself. (Surprise!) In an incredible plot contrivance, Amanda flees the scene of the action in a truck, and runs off the road and is thrown into the woods, but otherwise unharmed. (I bet you can't see what's coming next.) With most of the surviving cast in tow, Michael runs through the woods, finds Amanda, and in an utterly nauseating circle-of-life moment, repeats the cicada monster mating cycle. (It's been more than seventeen years since the film was made, so hopefully we are safe from a sequel.) In the stirring conclusion, Michael (now appearing more like a lichen monster) attacks his own father, and his mother has to take him out with a shotgun. They will be needing some therapy for quite a while I'm guessing.I gave the film three stars overall. The first half was downright boring, while the second half was much more captivating. The acting was all over the place. Cox was great, as was Jones, whose performance as the Sheriff was the best in the film, and reminded me a bit of Dennis Weaver in McCloud. Besch was fine, and had one of the more difficult roles to play: fainting, terror, and killing your own son are hard to pull off and make believable. Clemens was fine when in character as pre-cicada monster Michael, but quickly went over the top as the character started to change. A little goes a long way, and a bit more subtlety in the acting and direction would have helped. The prosthetics and effects look very dated by today's standards, but they are still better than some computer generated graphics I've seen. The single worst effect was the prehensile tongue scene in the hospital. (Groan.)This is an interesting film for horror fans: it's an excellent representative of modest-budget 1980's shock films. While parts are laughable, the last half is fairly captivating, and most of the actors turn in fine performances.",3,"""Kill Me Now; In An Hour It'll Be Too Late!""",1275523200,"06 3,

Jones, Don Gordon, R.G. Armstrong, and Luke Askew, a shivery score by veteran composer Les Baxter, and a willingness to favor atmosphere and subtext over stock shocks and splatter.The Scream Factory Blu-ray offers two informative commentary tracks--a friendly and informal one with Mora and Clemens, who discuss their respective challenges on the project as well as the actor's longtime interest in the horror genre, and a Q&A-styled; conversation with Holland, who mentions the cosmic fiction of H.P. Lovecraft as an influence on his script. A theatrical trailer, overripe with promotional ballyhoo, rounds out the presentation.This horror flick also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 9 years old in the 3rd grade during its theatrical release in the Spring of 1982 when Ronald Reagan was the president and we had all those fiscal budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982.",3,Intensely Gory,1391644800,"02 6, 2014",2014,2276,"['Largely', 'ignored', 'most', 'ardent', 'horror', 'archaeologists', 'Philippe', 'Mora', 'Beast', 'Within', 'curious', 'often', 'effective', 'blend', 'monster', 'movie', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'period-level', 'special', 'effects', 'grue.The', 'picture', 'disturbing', 'note', 'new', 'bride', 'Bibi', 'Besch', 'suffering', 'grizzly', 'assault', 'decidedly', 'inhuman', 'assailant', 'husband', 'Ronny', 'Cox', 'lonely', 'outskirts', 'small', 'Southern', 'town', 'seek', 'repair', 'disabled', 'car.Flash', 'forward', '17', 'years', 'teenage', 'son', 'Paul', 'Clemens', 'product', 'attack', 'dying', 'mysterious', 'ailment', 'initially', 'pituitary', 'gland', 'disorder.In', 'reality', 'boy', 'condition', 'far', 'more', 'sinister', 'nightmares', 'involving', 'vengeful', 'creature', 'drive', 'commit', 'murders', 'waking', 'hours', 'slowly', 'undergoing', 'complete', 'monstrous', 'transformation.Director', 'Mora', 'Howling', 'III', 'screenwriter', 'Tom', 'Holland', 'Child', 'Play', 'offer', 'intriguing', 'variation', 'werewolf', 'troops', 'mixed', 'coming-of-age', 'anxieties', 'distinctly', 'Southern', 'Gothic', 'flavor.If', 'end', 'results', 'are', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'clear-cut', 'Tom', 'Burman', 'gooey', 'bladder-heavy', 'makeup', 'special', 'effects', 'Clemens', 'final', 'change', 'boy', 'beast', 'are', 'undone', 'early', ""'80s"", 'technical', 'limitations', 'efforts', 'are', 'bolstered', 'solid', 'cast', 'such', 'stalwart', 'character', 'actors', 'L.Q', 'Jones', 'Don', 'Gordon', 'R.G', 'Armstrong', 'Luke', 'Askew', 'shivery', 'score', 'veteran', 'composer', 'Les', 'Baxter', 'willingness', 'favor', 'atmosphere', 'subtext', 'stock', 'shocks', 'splatter.The', 'Scream', 'Factory', 'Blu-ray', 'two', 'informative', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'friendly', 'informal', 'one', 'Mora', 'Clemens', 'who', 'discuss', 'respective', 'challenges', 'project', 'as', 'well', 'actor', 'longtime', 'interest', 'horror', 'genre', 'Q', 'A-styled', 'conversation', 'Holland', 'who', 'cosmic', 'fiction', 'H.P', 'Lovecraft', 'influence', 'script', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'overripe', 'promotional', 'ballyhoo', 'out', 'presentation.This', 'horror', 'flick', 'also', 'back', 'memory', 'lane', 'when', 'was', '9', 'years', 'old', '3rd', 'grade', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Spring', '1982', 'when', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'was', 'president', 'had', 'fiscal', 'budget', 'cuts', 'going', 'recession', 'had', 'back', '1981-1982']",N/A

A day later, Michael is found and confined in the hospital. However, strange and brutal killings have began to occur. The MacLeary family's lives are about to be changed forever.The film may have all the clich&eacute;s inherent in a horror film in its first act. Leaving your wife alone in the night in the woods to get help? Too clich&eacute;. The first act also has a lot of flaws in the script, certain details were unexplained as to how Caroline knew what to look for in the newspaper's back issues and just how Michael was able to drive to the small town by himself. Some scenes were also too convenient, such as his meeting with Amanda (Kitty Moffat). At first, I thought I was in a exploitation film, a monstrous unknown attacker raping a beautiful woman seemed straight out of J-horror sexploitation.But the film does OVERCOME its lackluster first act soon enough. I noticed ambition in its direction, when we see the woods in the attacker's first person view and only the hand was revealed when this thing undresses the younger Caroline. Surely signs of calculated direction by Mora. What also got my attention is the film's foreshadowing. The town undertaker, newspaper man were being killed; one by one. What was the killer's motivation? The killer's identity is not at all subtle, we all see him do the deed but the mystery lies in the why rather than in the who. The cellar door being opened also serves as the evil being unleashed.The direction and cinematography is quite competent and succeeds in the build up of its characters. You see Michael suffering as he exhibits very peculiar behavior and obscene acts. The film also has some clever bits of ""First Night"", that gave me the impression that I was watching a werewolf movie, but no, we don't get away that easy. The so-proclaimed ""Beast within"" is quite more sinister in its own way. In a way, it can be seen as the representation of raw fury and savage rage; the links between Michael and his mother's attacker may seem obvious but what isn't so obvious is just what exactly he is changing into.The direction manages to keep me very intrigued. Michael's slow transformation first affects his boyish features, slowly giving him signs of lack of sleep that results in his youthful looks to change into something very different. Now, when the final transformation does occur, it embodies all the film's hard work in generating restrained suspense that ends with an exclamation point. The transformation is a cross between ""The Howling"" (nope he's not a werewolf) and something totally ""Alien"" to me. The use of prosthetics were used to emulate the transformation; eyes were sinking under and his skin becomes part of gooey, slimy features--but it's not over, once Michael sheds his youthful skin then we see just what exactly the attacker was. Effects Supervisor Thomas Burman deserves a pat in the back. Rick Baker (An American Werewolf In London, Thriller), Stan Winston (R.I.P) and Thomas Burman have the stuff before to match today's standard CGI.Now the film does succeed in certain aspects of its premise. Restrained suspense, some blood and gore, full frontal nudity that all have the makings of a cult classic. The so-called secrets actually have some credibility but SOLID answers as to the causes of the transformation are never given. Biological failure due to cruelty, Hereditary causes or Possession? The answer is left to the viewer.Overall, I found ""The Beast Within"" a very creepy and suspenseful monster feature despite its flaws. The film's cinematography and direction were solid enough that it was able to make the argument that it is a good movie, and I was able to ignore the weaknesses in its script. Of course, the fact that the film is low budget gives it some elbow room. The film had an intriguing story, decent performances, the plot is mapped out quite well. If you compare it to the recent garbage the horror genre has been plagued for the past 3-4 years, it holds up quite well and may prove their better.Recommended!
