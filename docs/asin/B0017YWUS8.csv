1158245,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0017YWUS8,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Irina Palm is a film about a grandmother who loves her dying grandson more than anything in the world, but... in order to save his life, the family (including her son and daughter-in-law) has to find a way to come up with 6,000 dollars.  So, what's an easy way to get that much money?  Well, apparently for this reluctant grandmother, the means of getting such a large sum of money is by going into a dirty room, rubbing lotion on her hands and well, doing the dirty deed involving a wee wee bulging its way through a peeping hole.  No kidding!  She doesn't want to do it of course, but the amount of money she makes per week keeps her there.Of course she's incredibly shameful that she has to make money in such a pathetic way, and she keeps her work a secret from her son and other friends because, well, the reason is self-explanatory.  Well the grandson's health isn't improving and it's soon discovered an operation is required sooner rather than later, so she needs the money faster than ever before.  However, things don't go so pleasantly and well, I don't want to spoil anymore.The only thing I wish was further elaborated was the relationship involving her son and herself near the end.  Potential was there and don't get me wrong, the ending is satisfying enough but we needed a better conclusion since despite the graphic nature of the storyline (and by the way, they don't show the body parts you *think* they must show in order to illustrate the story) this film *is* technically a drama.  I guess I could complain that the story being told is rather simple and predictable but I don't really care- it's a different kind of drama so I have no major issues with it.

1158247,ADKZOXAOV8EXD,B0017YWUS8,Doctor.Generosity,"[0, 5]","This is an odd movie by Sam Garbarsky, a Belgian former advertising person who now makes feature films. Although it technically well done and has received respectful reviews here and other places, I found it unpleasant and depressing.The two principal actors, Marianne Faithful and Miki Manojlovic, are excellent in difficult parts. However, the atmosphere is distasteful. Irina, a middle aged woman who needs money for her grandson, is constrained to go to work giving anonymous handjobs in a seamy sex parlor. In the first place, this is a preposterous premise; it is just hard to believe this is what any 50 year old conservative grandmother would actually do in real life, and there is nothing we learn about Irina's background that would make this plausible. Second, the atmosphere of the sex shop is unappealing and the movie spends a lot of time there. Third, her son and daughter-in-law are disrespectful to her, cruel really, which I found even more unpleasant to watch and seemed unecessary to the premise. When her involvement as a sex worker is discovered, her son and her friends are merciless in their contempt. If that is not enough to depress you, the backstory is a terminally ill grandchild. Really cheery way to spend a couple of hours. There is a love story between the principals, but it's not enough to redeem the whole.Not every movie has to be fun and lighthearted of course but difficult or disturbing films reward us with a powerful drama or a powerful truth. In this case, I did admire the filmaking skill but watching this was just not enjoyable, and I failed to see the point.If you would like to see an also difficult but much more uplifting European drama of family conflict, I recommend ""Edge of Heaven.""",2,Unpleasant movie watching experience,1296864000,"02 5, 2011",2011,1736,"['odd', 'movie', 'Sam', 'Garbarsky', 'Belgian', 'former', 'advertising', 'person', 'who', 'now', 'feature', 'films', 'technically', 'well', 'done', 'received', 'respectful', 'reviews', 'here', 'other', 'places', 'found', 'unpleasant', 'depressing.The', 'two', 'principal', 'actors', 'Marianne', 'Faithful', 'Miki', 'Manojlovic', 'are', 'excellent', 'difficult', 'parts', 'However', 'atmosphere', 'distasteful', 'Irina', 'middle', 'aged', 'woman', 'who', 'money', 'grandson', 'constrained', 'go', 'work', 'giving', 'anonymous', 'handjobs', 'seamy', 'sex', 'parlor', 'first', 'place', 'preposterous', 'premise', 'just', 'hard', 'believe', 'what', '50', 'year', 'old', 'conservative', 'grandmother', 'would', 'actually', 'do', 'real', 'life', 'nothing', 'learn', 'Irina', 'background', 'would', 'make', 'plausible', 'Second', 'atmosphere', 'sex', 'shop', 'unappealing', 'movie', 'lot', 'time', 'there', 'Third', 'son', 'daughter-in-law', 'are', 'disrespectful', 'cruel', 'really', 'found', 'even', 'more', 'unpleasant', 'watch', 'seemed', 'unecessary', 'premise', 'When', 'involvement', 'sex', 'worker', 'discovered', 'son', 'friends', 'are', 'merciless', 'contempt', 'not', 'enough', 'depress', 'backstory', 'terminally', 'ill', 'grandchild', 'Really', 'cheery', 'way', 'spend', 'couple', 'hours', 'love', 'story', 'principals', 'not', 'enough', 'redeem', 'whole.Not', 'movie', 'be', 'fun', 'lighthearted', 'course', 'difficult', 'disturbing', 'films', 'reward', 'powerful', 'drama', 'powerful', 'truth', 'case', 'did', 'admire', 'filmaking', 'skill', 'watching', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'enjoyable', 'failed', 'see', 'point.If', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'also', 'difficult', 'much', 'more', 'uplifting', 'European', 'drama', 'family', 'conflict', 'recommend', 'Edge', 'Heaven']",Irina Palm
1158248,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0017YWUS8,Grady Harp,"[10, 10]","IRINA PALM may be a film too many people will overlook, thinking it either empty headed or pornographic.  But word of mouth should correct those misconceptions, as this little quiet film is a tender story of an aging woman's sacrifices and healthy outlook in the face of adversity. IRINA PALM is that happy marriage of comedy and drama,  a heartwarming tale that leaves the viewer with both a smile and a tear.Written by Director Sam Garbarski with Martin Herron and Phillipe Blasband, IRINA PALM is the story of  a widowed grandmother Maggie (Marianne Faithfull in a luminous performance) whose young grandson Ollie (Corey Burke) is gravely ill.  Maggie's son Tom (Kevin Bishop) and daughter-in-law Sarah (Siobhan Hewlett) cannot afford the transfer from England to Australia where the young lad could undergo curative treatment.  Maggie decides she must find a job - a daunting task for an older woman with no particular job training - to make the treatment affordable.  After numerous rejections from employment agencies, she spies a Sex Shop advertising for 'hostesses'. Thinking that designation means serving tea, etc, she enters the shady establishment and is interviewed by the owner Miki (Miki Manojlovic), a gentle man who gently describes the type of employment: Maggie would sit in a room and provide simple masturbation through a glory hole for anonymous clients. At first shocked by the job description, she in desperation investigates the business with the help of her soon to be best friend Luisa (Dorka Gryllus), and accepts the job with reservations.  To her surprise (and the surprise of Miki and Luisa) Maggie gains a loyal following of customers, so much so that she is given the name 'Irina Palm'.Keeping her employment a secret from everyone, she is the brunt of gossip from her old cronies and when she gives the money from her job to her son Tom without revealing its source, she causes a riff in the family.  Maggie is courted by other sex shop owners who offer higher pay, but she remains faithful to Miki who advanced her the money for Ollie's trip to Australia.  Tom stalks his mother to her workplace, discovers the source of her income, and explodes with anger and embarrassment that his mother would stoop to such depths.  But Maggie's role as Irina Palm has given her confidence and also opened her heart not only to her grandson's future but to her own happiness as well.  The ending may be expected by some, but will warm the hearts of everyone.There are many moments of humor - Maggie's learning her trade, her ultimate confession to her cronies as to her occupation, etc - and this lightness makes the dramatic message more powerful.  Faithfull is extraordinarily fine in this difficult role, but the entire cast is sensitively responsive to the screenplay and to director Garbarski's vision.  This is a film to cherish.  Highly recommended.

1158249,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,B0017YWUS8,Hikari,"[5, 7]","3.5 stars.  There have been many British films dealing with the gritty underbelly of the sex trade; despite a plot that would seem to mark this as one of those, this movie is much closer in in spirit to ""Shirley Valentine"" in its central theme of a woman of a certain age declaring emancipation from her boring and limited provincial existence and finding a late-in-life love in the most unlikely place.  Widowed Maggie, desperate to raise cash for medical treatment for her critically ill grandson winds up applying for a 'hostess' position in a SoHo sex club giving hand jobs.  Not because she wants this kind of work, but because with no education or job skills, it's all she can get.  The owner of the club agrees to give her a trial, and to his surprise, not to mention Maggie's own, she turns out to be a natural at this work, despite her prim demeanor.  In short order, Maggie is leading a duel existence: queen of the SoHo sex district by day (and night) as well as unassuming provincial grandmother, taking the train to London every afternoon from her village while trying to avoid detection by her nosy neighbors and her son and daughter-in-law.  Maggie's boss renames her 'Irina Palm' and makes her (or rather, her right hand) the centerpiece of his club.  At first intending to exploit this sheltered housewife, he winds up discovering tender feelings for his new employee.  Those familiar with Marianne Faithfull's storied past as 60's rock icon, girlfriend of Mick Jagger and infamous heroin addict will marvel that she can portray a timid woman of limited life experience just discovering her own identity, but she brings depth and pathos to Maggie's situation, as well as a dry humor.  The scenes where Maggie deals with the occupational hazard of '(not tennis) elbow' or tells off her snotty village friends after they find out what she's been up to are delightful.  I had expected a much darker and more exploitative tale, given the subject matter, but ""Irina Palm"" turned out to be an oddly lighthearted and life-affirming venture into cinema.",3,A Story Told by Hand,1236556800,"03 9, 2009",2009,2062,"['3.5', 'stars', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'British', 'films', 'dealing', 'gritty', 'underbelly', 'sex', 'trade', 'plot', 'would', 'seem', 'mark', 'one', 'movie', 'much', 'closer', 'spirit', 'Shirley', 'Valentine', 'central', 'theme', 'woman', 'certain', 'age', 'declaring', 'emancipation', 'boring', 'limited', 'provincial', 'existence', 'finding', 'late-in-life', 'love', 'most', 'unlikely', 'place', 'Widowed', 'Maggie', 'desperate', 'raise', 'cash', 'medical', 'treatment', 'critically', 'ill', 'grandson', 'up', 'applying', ""'hostess"", 'position', 'SoHo', 'sex', 'club', 'giving', 'hand', 'jobs', 'Not', 'kind', 'work', 'education', 'job', 'skills', 'can', 'get', 'owner', 'club', 'give', 'trial', 'surprise', 'not', 'mention', 'Maggie', 'own', 'out', 'be', 'natural', 'work', 'prim', 'demeanor', 'short', 'order', 'Maggie', 'leading', 'duel', 'existence', 'queen', 'SoHo', 'sex', 'district', 'day', 'night', 'as', 'well', 'unassuming', 'provincial', 'grandmother', 'taking', 'train', 'London', 'afternoon', 'village', 'trying', 'avoid', 'detection', 'nosy', 'neighbors', 'son', 'daughter-in-law', 'Maggie', 'boss', ""'Irina"", 'Palm', 'rather', 'right', 'hand', 'centerpiece', 'club', 'first', 'intending', 'exploit', 'sheltered', 'housewife', 'up', 'discovering', 'tender', 'feelings', 'new', 'employee', 'familiar', 'Marianne', 'Faithfull', 'storied', 'past', '60', 'rock', 'icon', 'girlfriend', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'infamous', 'heroin', 'addict', 'will', 'marvel', 'can', 'portray', 'timid', 'woman', 'limited', 'life', 'experience', 'just', 'discovering', 'own', 'identity', 'depth', 'pathos', 'Maggie', 'situation', 'as', 'well', 'dry', 'humor', 'scenes', 'where', 'Maggie', 'occupational', 'hazard', 'not', 'tennis', 'elbow', 'tells', 'off', 'snotty', 'village', 'friends', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'been', 'up', 'are', 'delightful', 'had', 'expected', 'much', 'darker', 'more', 'exploitative', 'tale', 'given', 'subject', 'matter', 'Irina', 'Palm', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'oddly', 'lighthearted', 'life-affirming', 'venture', 'cinema']",Irina Palm

1158252,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0017YWUS8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","""Irina Palm"" is a fascinating, if somewhat stilted, exploration of mother love and sacrifice.  We've certainly seen many similar cinematic journeys where women turn to the sex trade out of financial desperation.  However, I think it's fair to say that we've never seen a protagonist quite like Irina Palm.  What might have been a tawdry example of excess in someone else's hands is kept refreshingly honest in Sam Garbarski's understated direction.  With the camera lingering on the contours of star Marianne Faithfull's lived-in face, it is clear that ""Irina Palm"" hopes for an intimate character study as opposed to a lurid expose of its colorful setting.  And it is these choices, in the long run, which cause ""Irina Palm"" to stand out with a surprising amount of dignity.Faithfull stars as a grandmother devoted to her family.  As her grandson is in the hospital with a rather vaguely defined condition, they get the devastating news that the illness is worsening.  An experimental treatment is available but it will cost a lot of money to finance.  Desperate and willing to make any sacrifice for the boy, Faithfull ends up accepting the job as hostess in a neighborhood sex club.  As we all know, and as the proprietor explains to the rather innocent Faithfull, hostess is just a euphemism for a rather more hands-on experience.  Initially wary, money wins out.  But a greater transformation is within grasp.  Having always defined herself through others, the job soon becomes a liberation of sorts--especially as she rises to the heights of her chosen profession under the stage name of Irina Palm.I appreciated the unusual positioning that ""Irina Palm"" takes.  Faithfull, through the course of her sacrifice, is snapped back into the land of the living--realizing her worth as an individual.  Former wild child Faithfull (yes, it is the singer Faithfull who was intimately involved with The Rolling Stones) is an unlikely, but effective choice.  But while I enjoyed her matter-of-fact approach, she is perhaps a bit too stoic and emotionless.  Never varying expression more than a degree or two, I thought the film might have benefited from a bit more active involvement on her part.  There is also a bit of romance that culminates with a passionate kiss.  Supposed to be a defining moment, it comes across so awkwardly and devoid of real feeling.  In truth, I'm not sure I totally believed Faithfull getting the job, her relationship with her boss, or that she would end up being a star--but, despite my reservations, it is Faithfull's steadiness that kept the film grounded.  So, as you can see, I'm a bit conflicted in my reaction to Faithfull--but I don't see that as an entirely negative thing.  A unique character study that I think could be a nice surprise for adult audiences.

The biggest reasons for liking Irina Palm are Marianne Faithfull and Miki Manojlovic. They are terrific, both humble and genuine in their roles of hand-jobbist and sex-club owner, respectively. I hesitate to call them prostitute and pimp because that would grossly overstate their actual vocations. It's gross overstatements that slightly mar this otherwise delightful film about a woman who, apparently, stoops to a pretty low standard in her efforts to save the life of her gravely ill grandson.I write apparently because I couldn't help but conclude from this film that giving hand-jobs for a living is not all that bad. Maggie (Marianne Faithful) receives the moral high ground in her confrontations with both her friends and her son when the truth of her vocation is revealed. Her son makes a fool of himself, vastly over-acting and over-reacting when he discovers his mother working in a sex club. He sees her dressed in a typical day dress walking through the club. All the other women are half naked, but her son concludes that she is working as a whore. He calls her a whore, screams it at her without a single question. As the audience, we see this display of ridiculous emotion as misplaced. Maggie's daughter-in-law, who up to this point didn't seem to care if her son lived or died, rises to the defense of her mother-in-law. Maggie entered this degrading lifestyle to save her grandson. That's what is important.Maggie finds strength and a new, authentic life in refusing to accompany her son and grandson to Australia for the operation that will extend his life, and instead returns to the sex club and kisses (and presumably falls in love with) the sex club owner, who, in response to Maggie's declaration that she likes his smile, affirming their budding closeness, says ""I like the way you work."" Gracious me.Dorka Gryllus is also wonderful as the young veteran glory hole worker. But after developing her character, and her relationship with Maggie, she is abruptly tossed aside. The two of them had become friends, but Louisa (Gryllus) is unrealistically fired because, apparently, Maggie has taken away all her clients. On her way out, Louisa curses Maggie who has no idea why. When Maggie later approaches Louisa at her home in a run down housing project (isn't that where you'd expect a glory hole worker to live?) to attempt reconciliation perhaps, Louisa opens up a can of class-consciously aware worms in response, but then is shut out, turned off, and eliminated from the rest of the film entirely.The script to Irina Palm (palm, hand-job, get it?) has to have some tongue planted firmly in cheek. For those who are curious, there are no penises shown in the film, only arm movements and careful camera angles that suggest the size of the unseen units must average one to two feet in length. The rise of this mild-mannered, fifty-year-old grandma who can't even say the f-word, from nobody to the ""best right hand in London"", with men in long queues to receive her services is absurd. It's just not that kind of skill. It's a very small segment of a larger talent pool.Maggie wears her right arm in a sling for most of the film, suffering from penis elbow, which is akin to tennis elbow only from a different vocation. Enjoy the film.

1158255,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0017YWUS8,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 5]","Desperate to earn money so her critically ill grandson can have a much-needed operation, a modest and reserved middle-aged widow finds a job ""pleasuring"" men through a hole in the wall of a sleazy London strip joint.  Before you know it, Maggie is doing quite the little business (years of not doing manual labor have apparently paid off), with a steady stream of satisfied customers queuing up outside her cubicle, and a boss more than satisfied with the money she`s bringing in.  She's even adopted a stage name, Irina Palm, renowned for having the ""smoothest"" hand in the business.  But hiding the truth from her son and daughter-in-law and her snooty, gossipy friends becomes a daily challenge for Maggie as she debases herself for a noble cause.Despite its rather - um, shall we say ""touchy"" subject matter - ""Irina Palm"" is a warm human drama about a woman willing to go to any lengths to help a person she loves.  But that's only the glass-half-empty aspect of the story for, in a bizarre sort of way, this turns out to be one of the best things that's ever happened to Maggie.  Indeed, her willingness to meet life on its own terms - then, eventually, her own - opens up whole new possibilities for Maggie as an individual, possibilities that have hitherto remained unrealized due to the various social roles and conduct restrictions that have been imposed upon her throughout the course of her life.  Her new job gives her a type of freedom she's never had before, simply because it is she and she alone who is now determining what course that life will take.""Irina Palm"" may make some in the audience squirm at times, but the sheer preposterousness of what Maggie is being called upon to do in the name of money, and the empathy generated by famed singer Marianne Faithful's beautifully understated and heartfelt performance purge the film of any taint of luridness it might otherwise have had.  There's actually quite a bit of humor here as well, as Maggie begins by swallowing her pride - then finding a pride of her own in a job well done, much to the consternation of the sanctimonious prigs who surround her.  Yet, as directed and co-written by Sam Garbarski, ""Irina Palm"" makes it a point to be fair to its characters.  This is particularly the case with  Miklos, Maggie's boss (wonderfully played by Miki Manojlovic), who could easily have been portrayed as an irredeemable lout but who instead comes across as a shrewd but not unreasonable businessman with issues of his own to deal with and a spiritual connection with this strange woman who overturns not only his establishment but his heart.  And fine performances by Kevin Bishop, Siobhan Hewlett, Corey Burke and Jenny Agutter (""An American Werewolf in London"") add to the emotional richness of the piece.This is a surprisingly tender and touching film that will have you rooting for the middle-aged widow with the magic hand almost in spite of yourself.",4,touchy subject handled with delicacy and taste,1280275200,"07 28, 2010",2010,2927,"['Desperate', 'earn', 'money', 'critically', 'ill', 'grandson', 'can', 'have', 'much-needed', 'operation', 'modest', 'reserved', 'middle-aged', 'widow', 'job', 'pleasuring', 'men', 'hole', 'wall', 'sleazy', 'London', 'strip', 'joint', 'know', 'Maggie', 'doing', 'quite', 'little', 'business', 'years', 'not', 'doing', 'manual', 'labor', 'have', 'apparently', 'paid', 'off', 'steady', 'stream', 'satisfied', 'customers', 'queuing', 'up', 'cubicle', 'boss', 'more', 'satisfied', 'money', 's', 'bringing', 'even', 'adopted', 'stage', 'name', 'Irina', 'Palm', 'renowned', 'having', 'smoothest', 'hand', 'business', 'hiding', 'truth', 'son', 'daughter-in-law', 'snooty', 'gossipy', 'friends', 'daily', 'challenge', 'Maggie', 'noble', 'cause.Despite', 'rather', 'um', 'shall', 'say', 'touchy', 'subject', 'matter', 'Irina', 'Palm', 'warm', 'human', 'drama', 'woman', 'willing', 'go', 'lengths', 'help', 'person', 'only', 'glass-half-empty', 'aspect', 'story', 'bizarre', 'sort', 'way', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'ever', 'happened', 'Maggie', 'Indeed', 'willingness', 'meet', 'life', 'own', 'terms', 'then', 'eventually', 'own', 'up', 'whole', 'new', 'possibilities', 'Maggie', 'individual', 'possibilities', 'have', 'hitherto', 'remained', 'unrealized', 'due', 'various', 'social', 'roles', 'conduct', 'restrictions', 'have', 'been', 'imposed', 'course', 'life', 'new', 'job', 'type', 'freedom', 'never', 'had', 'simply', 'alone', 'who', 'now', 'determining', 'what', 'course', 'life', 'will', 'take', 'Irina', 'Palm', 'may', 'make', 'audience', 'squirm', 'times', 'sheer', 'preposterousness', 'what', 'Maggie', 'being', 'called', 'upon', 'do', 'name', 'money', 'empathy', 'generated', 'famed', 'singer', 'Marianne', 'Faithful', 'beautifully', 'understated', 'heartfelt', 'performance', 'purge', 'film', 'taint', 'luridness', 'might', 'otherwise', 'have', 'had', 'actually', 'quite', 'bit', 'humor', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Maggie', 'swallowing', 'pride', 'then', 'finding', 'pride', 'own', 'job', 'well', 'done', 'much', 'consternation', 'sanctimonious', 'prigs', 'who', 'surround', 'Yet', 'directed', 'co-written', 'Sam', 'Garbarski', 'Irina', 'Palm', 'point', 'be', 'fair', 'characters', 'particularly', 'case', 'Miklos', 'Maggie', 'boss', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Miki', 'Manojlovic', 'who', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'portrayed', 'irredeemable', 'lout', 'who', 'instead', 'across', 'shrewd', 'not', 'unreasonable', 'businessman', 'issues', 'own', 'deal', 'spiritual', 'connection', 'strange', 'woman', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'establishment', 'heart', 'fine', 'performances', 'Kevin', 'Bishop', 'Siobhan', 'Hewlett', 'Corey', 'Burke', 'Jenny', 'Agutter', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'add', 'emotional', 'richness', 'piece.This', 'surprisingly', 'tender', 'touching', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'rooting', 'middle-aged', 'widow', 'magic', 'hand', 'almost', 'spite']",Irina Palm
