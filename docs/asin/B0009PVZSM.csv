910705,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0009PVZSM,Grady Harp,"[13, 15]","It is rare to come across films as unique and fine tuned as CHRYSTAL, even more so when the only recognizable feature is the big name star on the film's cover.  But in this first cinematic outing by the enormously gifted Ray McKinnon there are so many sparks of greatness that they dwell on the screen like glowing embers until the collective heat explodes into a impressive fire of creative skill.Ray McKinnon both wrote and directed this film and also plays one of the key characters (in an award-deserving performance for supporting actor!).  His method of telling a story is as slow and gradual as a festering abscess and he makes his audience stay alert until all of the dots are gradually joined to reveal the whole picture: that takes writing and directing guts in a time when audiences want to be spoon fed linear plots summarized in a sentence. McKinnon's courage (and budgetary constraints) made him cast his film with mostly unknown actors, each of whom performs like seasoned veterans.  How much of that is due to the presence of such fine talent as Billy Bob Thornton, Harry Dean Stanton, and Lisa Blount is up for speculation, but it is McKinnon's sure hand both in writing and in directing that makes this little film so pungent and memorable.Joe (Billy Bob Thornton - in a brilliantly understated performance) returns to a little trashy town in Arkansas in mid Ozarks after a 20 year prison time for drugs, DUI, and attempts to escape: his imprisonment began after a car crash that killed his young son and left his wife Chrystal (Lisa Blount, an actress of tremendous depth) with a broken neck and a broken spirit and soul, living in squalor and providing sex for all of the men and boys of the area.  Chrystal is a used, spent, fragile creature, in constant pain from her neck fracture and living like a walking emotional zombie.  Joe returns, and without much dialogue cleans the yard and house and land and  ensconces himself on the porch of their house, tended only by Chrystal's confused old dog.Word gets around that Joe, known for his growing of high caliber marijuana before incarceration, has returned and the local smarmy drug king Snake (Ray McKinnon) and his pals attempt to draw Joe back into a life of crime.  Joe aches for redemption for his past mistakes, longs to retrieve his marriage with the severely emotionally damaged Chrystal, and is willing to fight to protect his new life.  Gruesome encounters with Snake and with the townsfolk ensue.  With all of the myriad pieces of this story finally woven into an amazing quilt, Joe and Chrystal come as close to redemption as is feasible.The story is so much more layered than this too brief synopsis, but revealing more would deprive the viewer of the heady work and rewards of staying with this stunning film.  The musical score is spare but eminently appropriate, combining Bruce Springsteen records with original music by Stephen Trask and some haunting Ozark tunes sung by Lisa Blount, Harry Dean Stanton (as Pa Da) and others.  The setting is atmospheric and the cinematography by Adam Kimmel captures McKinnon's story's mood impeccably.  The cast is some of the finest ensemble acting seen in years, especially in view of the fact that most of the actors have little screen experience.Sounds like a rave review?  Well, it is.  This is one extraordinary piece of work and just like the not dissimilar Faulkner novels it takes work, but the payoff is equally satisfying.  Highly Recommended - for viewing, for the afterburn of the experience, and for votes for just awards!

910710,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0009PVZSM,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[11, 12]","Oscar Winner Billy Bob Thornton (Best Adapted Screenplay, Sling Blade) gives one of his best performances in ""Chrystal"" a massively overlooked and under rated movie that captures the southern atmosphere and elivers a compelling and sometimes funny movie. Thornton plays Joe, who sixteen years before drove his wife Chrystal (Lisa Blount) and their young boy off a cliff. Joe came out of the wreck fine and went on to serve a 16 year prison term. Chrystal is mentally unstable and has become, virtually, the town hooker. The little boy was never found, not a trace. When Joe is released from prison, he returns to the home he shared with Chrystal and begins staying on the porch and reuniting with some old friends. Chrystal, meanwhile, befriends a blind writer named Kalid (Harry Lennix, of The Matrix films). Now, even though Thornton is spectacular; Blount makes the kind of first impression actresses like Amy Adams did in ""Junebug"". She really overshadows all of the other actors who are much better known then herself. She plays the deeply disturbed Chrystal to a T. I'm surprised she didn't nab an Oscar nomination. I'm not sure why this film was so ""under the radar"" because it truly is a marvelous film. There are times when the film stumbles a bit and the character Snake (who I was surprised to find was played by writer/director Ray McKinnon) overstayed his welcome but if you are in a video store you should really rent this movie.GRADE: A-",5,Thought Provoking,1147132800,"05 9, 2006",2006,1452,"['Oscar', 'Winner', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'Chrystal', 'massively', 'overlooked', 'rated', 'movie', 'southern', 'atmosphere', 'compelling', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'movie', 'Thornton', 'Joe', 'who', 'sixteen', 'years', 'drove', 'wife', 'Chrystal', 'Lisa', 'Blount', 'young', 'boy', 'off', 'cliff', 'Joe', 'came', 'wreck', 'fine', 'went', 'serve', '16', 'year', 'prison', 'term', 'Chrystal', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'become', 'virtually', 'town', 'hooker', 'little', 'boy', 'was', 'never', 'found', 'not', 'trace', 'When', 'Joe', 'released', 'prison', 'home', 'shared', 'Chrystal', 'staying', 'porch', 'reuniting', 'old', 'friends', 'Chrystal', 'meanwhile', 'blind', 'writer', 'named', 'Kalid', 'Harry', 'Lennix', 'Matrix', 'films', 'Now', 'even', 'Thornton', 'spectacular', 'Blount', 'kind', 'first', 'impression', 'actresses', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'did', 'Junebug', 'really', 'other', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'known', 'then', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'Chrystal', 'T.', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'nab', 'Oscar', 'nomination', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'radar', 'truly', 'marvelous', 'film', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'film', 'bit', 'character', 'Snake', 'who', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'was', 'played', 'writer/director', 'Ray', 'McKinnon', 'overstayed', 'welcome', 'are', 'video', 'store', 'should', 'really', 'rent', 'movie.GRADE', 'A-']",Chrystal

Sherwin,"[4, 4]","Chrystal paints a portrait of the anguish and endless heartache a couple experiences after a tragic car accident take the life of their young son and leaves the woman with a broken neck and soul. The cinematography is excellent; and I like that they filmed this in Arkansas where the plot does take place. The choreography works wonders for the fights scenes and other scenes including the one in which Chrystal (Lisa Blount) sings a beautiful song called ""Rockin' Chair."" The plot moves along at a fairly good pace although they could have edited out a little bit here and there to tighten things up and make it a bit more dynamic; but the acting is superb and very convincing.When the movie starts, we see a flashback of that fateful night when Joe (Billy Bob Thornton) and his wife Chrystal (Lisa Blount) are going somewhere in their car with their young son almost twenty years ago. Joe is drunk and there is a horrible accident which takes the life of their young son whose remains were never even found; Joe also winds up in prison for drugs dealing, DUI and more than one attempt to escape. Chrystal remains so heartbroken and fragile after the crash that her life as a single woman waiting for Joe to return takes quite a downward spiral as she slowly but surely turns into a woman who provides ""comfort"" for just about any guy who wants time alone with a woman; and the physical pain from her old neck injury isn't helping her, either.But one day Joe returns home; he and Chrystal must deal with quite a dilemma. Are they still husband and wife? Are they still in love with each other? Who is to blame, if anyone, for that car crash so many years ago? The answers are far from easy and it's quite a treat to see Billy Bob Thornton and Lisa Blount play out their roles with such polish.Look also for a great performance by Ray McKinnon as the rather unlikable ""Snake"" who is the drug warlord of the redneck little town in which they all live--he's got quite a bone to pick with Joe, too. Harry Lennix plays Kalid, a blind African-American musicologist who helps Chrystal in his own way and Grace Zabriskie does a fine job playing Gladys, Chrystal's mother who isn't exactly too fond of Joe.The DVD does not come with any extras unless you count a plug or two for other movies on DVD; and I don't count that as an extra. That's a disappointment; I would have loved a commentary or at least some deleted scenes. Not good!Overall, Chrystal is a very good film that tells quite a story and it isn't always too pretty; this movie deals with some rough stuff indeed! If you're interested in films that deal with redemption, life in rural America and fragile people trying so hard to live with their scars, this would be a good movie for you to get. I give it four stars instead of five primarily because the plot is just a bit too slow bit here and there; and the lack of any extra bonus features is a disappointment.",4,creative and pungent--with excellent acting by all,1256774400,"10 29, 2009",2009,2919,"['Chrystal', 'paints', 'portrait', 'anguish', 'endless', 'heartache', 'couple', 'experiences', 'tragic', 'car', 'accident', 'take', 'life', 'young', 'son', 'woman', 'broken', 'neck', 'soul', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'like', 'filmed', 'Arkansas', 'where', 'plot', 'take', 'place', 'choreography', 'wonders', 'fights', 'scenes', 'other', 'scenes', 'including', 'one', 'Chrystal', 'Lisa', 'Blount', 'beautiful', 'song', 'called', 'Rockin', 'Chair', 'plot', 'along', 'fairly', 'good', 'pace', 'could', 'have', 'edited', 'out', 'little', 'bit', 'here', 'there', 'tighten', 'things', 'up', 'make', 'bit', 'more', 'dynamic', 'acting', 'superb', 'very', 'convincing.When', 'movie', 'see', 'flashback', 'fateful', 'night', 'when', 'Joe', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'wife', 'Chrystal', 'Lisa', 'Blount', 'are', 'going', 'somewhere', 'car', 'young', 'son', 'almost', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'Joe', 'drunk', 'horrible', 'accident', 'life', 'young', 'son', 'remains', 'were', 'never', 'even', 'found', 'Joe', 'also', 'up', 'prison', 'drugs', 'dealing', 'DUI', 'more', 'one', 'attempt', 'escape', 'Chrystal', 'so', 'heartbroken', 'fragile', 'crash', 'life', 'single', 'woman', 'waiting', 'Joe', 'return', 'quite', 'downward', 'spiral', 'slowly', 'surely', 'woman', 'who', 'comfort', 'just', 'guy', 'who', 'time', 'alone', 'woman', 'physical', 'pain', 'old', 'neck', 'injury', ""n't"", 'helping', 'either.But', 'one', 'day', 'Joe', 'home', 'Chrystal', 'must', 'deal', 'dilemma', 'Are', 'still', 'husband', 'wife', 'Are', 'still', 'love', 'other', 'Who', 'blame', 'anyone', 'car', 'crash', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'answers', 'are', 'far', 'easy', 'quite', 'treat', 'see', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Lisa', 'Blount', 'play', 'out', 'roles', 'such', 'polish.Look', 'also', 'great', 'performance', 'Ray', 'McKinnon', 'rather', 'unlikable', 'Snake', 'who', 'drug', 'warlord', 'redneck', 'little', 'town', 'live', 'got', 'quite', 'bone', 'pick', 'Joe', 'too', 'Harry', 'Lennix', 'Kalid', 'blind', 'African-American', 'musicologist', 'who', 'Chrystal', 'own', 'way', 'Grace', 'Zabriskie', 'fine', 'job', 'playing', 'Gladys', 'Chrystal', 'mother', 'who', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'too', 'fond', 'Joe.The', 'DVD', 'not', 'come', 'extras', 'count', 'plug', 'two', 'other', 'movies', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'that', 'extra', 'disappointment', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'commentary', 'least', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Not', 'good', 'Overall', 'Chrystal', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'quite', 'story', ""n't"", 'always', 'too', 'pretty', 'movie', 'rough', 'stuff', 'indeed', ""'re"", 'interested', 'films', 'deal', 'redemption', 'life', 'rural', 'America', 'fragile', 'people', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'live', 'scars', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'get', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'primarily', 'plot', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'slow', 'bit', 'here', 'there', 'lack', 'extra', 'bonus', 'features', 'disappointment']",Chrystal

He was put in there from selling marijuana all those years ago. Also years ago there was a horrible car crash involving him, his wife Chrystal played by Lisa Blount (Box of Moon Light) and their kid. Their kid eventually wasnt found which meant he died. Chrystal was left with a broken neck. Nowadays she gives herself away for sex to some of the guys and boys in town. Joe comes back to Chrystal. Ray McKinnon the director plays Snake (annoying performance by the way) and some of the supporting cast weighs it down but the others like Harry Lennix (The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions) as a blind musician and Johnny Galecki (Rosanne, Suicide Kings) as his helper add some spark. Also starring Grace Zabriskie (RSVP), Harry Dean Stanton (Paris Texas, She's So Lovely) and Walton Goggins (The Shield, The Crow: Salvation). Thornton adds another great performance to his bundle (he looked like Grizzly Adams towards the end) but whats best about this movie is Blount's performance as Chrystal.

He discovers that old wounds don't heal so easily once reopened. He would like a reconciliation so they can start over again but Chrystal can barely acknowledge him.They both see fleeting images that their son is still out there somewhere in the forest. These visions seem to be their only remaining bond.The themes explored are loss, guilt, anger, violence, forgiveness and redemption.And the power of sacrifice.A disturbing yet beautiful film.",5,Disturbing but beautiful,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,1905,"['Chrystal', '2004', 'Lisa', 'Blount', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'StantionRated', 'R.An', 'radar', 'indie', 'drama', 'overlooked', 'ignored', 'place', 'lonesome', 'Ozark', 'mountains.This', 'movie', 'not', 'tastes.Another', 'button', 'pusher', 'time', 'blue', 'grass', 'trashy', 'rednecks', 'back', 'woods.Atmospheric', 'moody.A', 'woman', 'named', 'Chrystal', 'tormented', 'agony', 'losing', 'little', 'boy', 'senseless', 'tragedy', 'brought', 'about', 'drug', 'dealing', 'DUI', 'husband', 'Joe', 'crashing', 'car', 'trying', 'outrun', 'police.She', 'helplessly', 'depression', 'moral', 'bankruptcy', 'offering', 'sexual', 'favors', 'young', 'local', 'males', 'help', 'take', 'mind', 'tragedy', 'order', 'feel', 'something', 'other', 'mental', 'pain', 'plight', 'Joe', 'twenty', 'year', 'incarceration.She', 'however', 'seem', 'hang', 'what', 'little', 'sanity', 'left', 'existing', 'isolated', 'homestead', 'dog', 'named', 'Precious.All', 'ever', 'wanted', 'was', 'child', 'now', 'child', 'gone', 'no', 'longer', 'able', 'conceive', 'due', 'injuries', 'sustained', 'accident', 'including', 'fractured', 'neck', 'broken', 'soul.She', 'lives', 'spent', 'shell', 'person', 'constant', 'physical', 'emotional', 'pain.She', 'perpetually', 'haunted', 'thoughts', 'baby', 'still', 'out', 'there', 'woodsy', 'somewhere.Strangely', 'enough', 'remains', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'were', 'never', 'found.After', 'release', 'Joe', 'back', 'seeking', 'somehow', 'redeem', 'old', 'wounds', 'do', ""n't"", 'heal', 'so', 'easily', 'once', 'reopened', 'would', 'like', 'reconciliation', 'can', 'start', 'over', 'again', 'Chrystal', 'can', 'barely', 'acknowledge', 'him.They', 'see', 'fleeting', 'images', 'son', 'still', 'there', 'somewhere', 'forest', 'visions', 'seem', 'be', 'only', 'remaining', 'bond.The', 'themes', 'explored', 'are', 'loss', 'guilt', 'anger', 'violence', 'forgiveness', 'redemption.And', 'power', 'sacrifice.A', 'disturbing', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'film']",Chrystal

I don't know what these other reviewers were watching, but it couldn't have been this movie.First of all, this was the most depressing, downhearted, pessimistic, piece of trash I'd ever set eyes on, I don't believe there was a genuinely ""good"" smile in the entire flick.Lisa Blount played an absolute ditz, and Billy Bob was nonchalant in his role, almost as if he didn't care about any more than the paycheck he got each week during filming.There were quite a few holes in the plot, also.  The only one I care to mention without spoiling the movie is this:  During the fight between Billy's character and Snake, it was clear Billy had the upperhand, but somewhere in the middle of the fight he decided to just give up.  What was that all about?  My wife and I looked at each other and said, almost simultaneously, ""Why isn't he fighting back?""  There was absolutely NO reason for him to wimp out at the moment he did.  It didn't tie into the story at all.  Basically, he started the fight by calling Snake out, and then just let Snake whip his rear, nonsensical idiocy.The whole movie was like that, two hours of questionable stupidity, and then fizzling out at the end, with nothing more than a whimper.

It deals with violence, crime, tragedy, forgiveness, redemption, and reconcilation. It's a great vehicle to showcase the relatively unknown Lisa Blount who managed to upstaged the rather low-key Billy Bob Thorton. Blount plays the title character who was traumatized and physically damaged by the car accident that took the life of her little boy. Her husband Joe(Thorton) was to blame for the tragedy, because he was smuggling drug in the car, and ended sentenced to prison for twenty years.During the time when Joe was absent, Chrystal lives alone with her dog Precise in an isolated farm, and she occasionally offers herself sexually to the local boys. She's constantly haunted by the death of her son, and still angry at Joe when he came home. They no longer connect emotionally and sexually. At one point, Joe ask her,"" Am I still your husband?"" She responded angrily and said,""If you just want my P****, just come and get it...."". He's trying to seek her forgiveness and start over again, but the worst thing was that she can no longer have children.The local marajuana dealer named Snake(Ray McKinnon, director and writer of this film) tried to persuade Joe to grow marajuana on his farm, but he declined, and things get nasty and physical between the two. Meanwhile, a travelling blind musicologist named Kalid is in town to gather research for his book, and becomes friend with Chrystal who used to be a good singer. This subplot allowed the film to feature many beautiful songs that resembles Songcatcher and some of the Bluegrass music featured in You Can Count On Me. Things gets even more ugly when Snake and his gang chased Chrystal and Kalid into the woods and want to gang rape her. Fortunately, Joe was hiding in the woods and rescued them. Will Chrystal be able to reconcile with Joe and let go of the the shadows of the past?Overall, the performances are very good, and the actors delivered their lines with impressive southern accent.
