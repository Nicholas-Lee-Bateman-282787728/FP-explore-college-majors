161288,A2JYIDH7JIG48H,0800107160,"R. Christenson / Lunamation ""SpaceComics.com""","[7, 7]","Vice Versa is one of the funniest comedies about a child changing places with an adult.  There are several other movies like this in which the mind of a child occupies an adult body and, in this case, vice versa, or some similar variation.  They include Like Father Like Son, Freaky Friday, Big, Dream A Little Dream, Eighteen Again, and The Kid.  In Vice Versa Judge Reinhold plays Marshall Seymour, a divorced department store purchaser who has his son  Charlie (Fred Savage of The Wonder Years, The Wizard, etc.) for the weekend.  Marshall just returned from a buying trip in the orient, mistakenly in posession of a magical skull.  Charlie thinks his dad's unfairly ragging on him and in the midst of an argument, he finds the skull and Marshall tries to take it away from him.  Just as they are both handling it, in the heat of argument Charlie wishes they could trade places, and they do.  Before they figure out how to change back, Marshall has to attend Charlie's school in the boys body, and Charlie has to go to work at the department store as Marshall, as well as deal with the man's rocky relationship with his girfriend.  All these situations provide plenty of laughs.  One of my favorite parts is when Charlie's mother walks in on them, and sees her son Charlie - really her ex Marshall - drinking a martini.  His reaction is as funny as hers:  ""S*#& what's she doing here?""  You have to see it to get it.  Other good comedy emerges from Charlie's adventures as a grownup in the department store and Marshall's experiences as a kid, dealing with bullies and teachers at school.

161289,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,0800107160,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[0, 0]","Judge Reinhold did an excellent job of portraying a 10 year old kid.  And Fred Savage's attitude as a stressed-out, overworked adult, suddenly lunged into an inconvenient situation of being trapped in a kid's body was hilarious while being in a very high financial position for a major department store.Judge Reinhold plays a divorced overworked department store product purchaser and he struggles to even find time to spend a weekend with his son that he tries to do but his job is just too demanding of his time.Judge Reinhold and his fellow worker girlfriend (played by the gorgeous underrated Corinne Bohrer) go to Thailand and buy a beautiful vase, which he actually loses to an unintended trade-off for a stolen ancient magical skull.Anyway, further into the film, Judge Reinhold was holding the skull the same time his son was touching it, and they made a rhetorical statement that they wish that they could switch lives with each other, and so that's what happened.  The mystical skull switched their bodies and the hilarious antics begin from there.I enjoyed this movie more than I enjoyed the movie ""Big"" with Tom Hanks. Which was basically on the same subject of a father and son switching roles.  I think because the young Fred Savage was so convincing with his mature mentality with the situation of sounding and acting like an adult, that is what makes this movie so much more entertaining.  The way he fought back at the kids at school who usually picked on him, was priceless.This is just another example of great 1980's movie entertainment.",4,"This one, to me, was better than Tom Hank's film ""Big""",1273881600,"05 15, 2010",2010,1557,"['Judge', 'Reinhold', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', '10', 'year', 'old', 'kid', 'Fred', 'Savage', 'attitude', 'stressed-out', 'overworked', 'adult', 'suddenly', 'lunged', 'inconvenient', 'situation', 'being', 'trapped', 'kid', 'body', 'was', 'hilarious', 'being', 'very', 'high', 'financial', 'position', 'major', 'department', 'store.Judge', 'Reinhold', 'divorced', 'overworked', 'department', 'store', 'product', 'purchaser', 'even', 'find', 'time', 'spend', 'weekend', 'son', 'do', 'job', 'just', 'too', 'demanding', 'time.Judge', 'Reinhold', 'fellow', 'worker', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'gorgeous', 'underrated', 'Corinne', 'Bohrer', 'go', 'Thailand', 'buy', 'beautiful', 'vase', 'actually', 'unintended', 'trade-off', 'stolen', 'ancient', 'magical', 'skull.Anyway', 'further', 'film', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'was', 'holding', 'skull', 'same', 'time', 'son', 'was', 'touching', 'made', 'rhetorical', 'statement', 'wish', 'could', 'switch', 'lives', 'other', 'so', 'what', 'happened', 'mystical', 'skull', 'switched', 'bodies', 'hilarious', 'antics', 'begin', 'there.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'more', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Big', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Which', 'was', 'basically', 'same', 'subject', 'father', 'son', 'switching', 'roles', 'think', 'young', 'Fred', 'Savage', 'was', 'so', 'convincing', 'mature', 'mentality', 'situation', 'sounding', 'acting', 'adult', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'way', 'fought', 'back', 'kids', 'school', 'who', 'usually', 'picked', 'was', 'priceless.This', 'just', 'example', 'great', '1980', 'movie', 'entertainment']",N/A
