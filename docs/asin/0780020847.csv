Some may like the Outback scenery, it's too heat blasted for me. I did like various bits of the scenery and of the story but the viewer has to sit through what I guess is supposed to be an art film, too many disjointed bits. Jenny Agutter's swimming hole scene seemed like an excuse for nudity, it did nothing for the story line unlike the dream sequence at the end where all three ramblers swim nude. If that was meant to give a sense of freedom from the stresses of the modern day world it did a much better job.

If possible seeing this on a theatre screen or at least a large plasma is ideal, as the heart of it is the awesome imagery of Australia's ""Outback.""It is in that expansive land, where nature and it's profound beauty and violence that two kids find themselves, abandoned by a father, a modern white man, finished with himself and life. Having brought his kids out into the wild, ostensibly for them to lunch and play while he peruses his geology paperwork, he also can't help stare at his daughter. This interfamily tension, the rigidity of urban life-captured in brick walls and symmetrical classroom alignments where the lifeless droning of school excercise (which poses an early juxta to the ancient chanting and John Barry's fabulous score) and stilted uniforms are what these kids know, but just as soon let go of in a journey through all-time. Without much questioning the girl and her younger brother survive, without very much fear, or doubt only to be saved when they do appear to be starved by a sixteen year old Aborigine on his rite-of-passage-into-manhood Walkabout.The allegorical and metaphorical nature of Walkabout is clear and infinite. Two worlds and civilizations have met, language easily gives way to gesture and sound, and love, the greatest unification of worlds, blossoms.But the divide between the pure ancient young man and the tough, staunch urban girl proves too great for her. Following a remarkable mating dance in which he paints himself and offers flowers, a gesture she dismisses, the bond is broken, and the tragedy of encroachment and progress is upon us.This is a definite masterpiece. A film worthy of school showings, be it elementary or graduate. Memory and reality. Peaceful yet violent. Meditative yet ominous. Warm yet jangling. As a gesture of awe, respect and sorrow at the Aboriginal experience it has few parellels. Perhaps Peter Weir's The Last Wave and Philip Noyce's Rabbit-Proof Fence (both of which feature David Gulpilil, who plays the Aborigine) can be it's companion.",5,Highways of Happiness,1160092800,"10 6, 2006",2006,2060,"['Walkabout', 'truly', 'exceptional', 'film', 'possible', 'seeing', 'theatre', 'screen', 'least', 'large', 'plasma', 'ideal', 'heart', 'awesome', 'imagery', 'Australia', 'Outback', 'expansive', 'land', 'where', 'nature', 'profound', 'beauty', 'violence', 'two', 'kids', 'find', 'abandoned', 'father', 'modern', 'white', 'man', 'finished', 'life', 'Having', 'brought', 'kids', 'out', 'wild', 'ostensibly', 'lunch', 'play', 'geology', 'paperwork', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'stare', 'daughter', 'interfamily', 'tension', 'rigidity', 'urban', 'life-captured', 'brick', 'walls', 'symmetrical', 'classroom', 'alignments', 'where', 'lifeless', 'droning', 'school', 'excercise', 'early', 'juxta', 'ancient', 'chanting', 'John', 'Barry', 'fabulous', 'score', 'stilted', 'uniforms', 'are', 'what', 'kids', 'know', 'just', 'soon', 'let', 'go', 'journey', 'all-time', 'much', 'questioning', 'girl', 'younger', 'brother', 'survive', 'very', 'much', 'fear', 'doubt', 'only', 'be', 'saved', 'when', 'do', 'appear', 'be', 'starved', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'Aborigine', 'rite-of-passage-into-manhood', 'Walkabout.The', 'allegorical', 'metaphorical', 'nature', 'Walkabout', 'clear', 'infinite', 'Two', 'worlds', 'civilizations', 'have', 'met', 'language', 'easily', 'way', 'gesture', 'sound', 'love', 'greatest', 'unification', 'worlds', 'blossoms.But', 'divide', 'pure', 'ancient', 'young', 'man', 'tough', 'staunch', 'urban', 'girl', 'too', 'great', 'Following', 'remarkable', 'mating', 'dance', 'flowers', 'gesture', 'bond', 'broken', 'tragedy', 'encroachment', 'progress', 'us.This', 'definite', 'masterpiece', 'film', 'worthy', 'school', 'showings', 'be', 'elementary', 'graduate', 'Memory', 'reality', 'Peaceful', 'yet', 'violent', 'Meditative', 'yet', 'ominous', 'Warm', 'yet', 'jangling', 'gesture', 'awe', 'respect', 'sorrow', 'Aboriginal', 'experience', 'few', 'parellels', 'Perhaps', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'Last', 'Wave', 'Philip', 'Noyce', 'Rabbit-Proof', 'Fence', 'feature', 'David', 'Gulpilil', 'who', 'Aborigine', 'can', 'be', 'companion']",N/A
25133,A1IDHT7P50QRP9,0780020847,Adam Lenhardt,"[20, 22]","Walkabout is a surreal film that walks the line between art house film and nature documentary. It's worth picking up the Blu-ray for the 1080P resolution nature photography of the 1970s Australian Outback, but there's so much more to the film than that. Adapted from James Vance Marshall's novel, the film departs from the source material at several crucial points. The first is the children's method of becoming stranded in the outback; instead of a relatively straight forward plane crash, the film presents a bizarre scenario of a family picnic gone terribly wrong. Fathers committing murder-suicides upon their families was virtually unheard of in 1971, but is unfortunately all too common today. The teenage girl and her barely school-age brother venture out into the wilderness as symbols of the British ruling class, their starched school uniforms a stark contrasts with the wilderness all around them. Jenny Agutter carries the film, since it is from the teenage girl's perspective that we experience the journey. The relationship between her and the aborigine boy is timeless and universal yet fraught with the social divisions and cultural confusion of their experiences. The British schoolgirl in her patronizes the aborigine even as he ensures their survival. The pubescent teenage girl in her finds herself in close corners with a pubescent teenage boy. The sexual undercurrent is understated but obvious. It is beautifully rendered, and ultimately tragic. The tentative, uneasy relationship between the white school girl and the aborigine boy is a metaphor for the relationship between the white colonists and the natives as a whole. And it is the story of childhood's last gasp, and the longing we hold for the freedom we once had when all of our serious choices were ahead of us.",5,Haunting film with nature photography worthy of Blu-ray,1280102400,"07 26, 2010",2010,1795,"['Walkabout', 'surreal', 'film', 'line', 'art', 'house', 'film', 'nature', 'documentary', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'Blu-ray', '1080P', 'resolution', 'nature', 'photography', '1970s', 'Australian', 'Outback', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'film', 'Adapted', 'James', 'Vance', 'Marshall', 'novel', 'film', 'departs', 'source', 'material', 'several', 'crucial', 'points', 'first', 'children', 'method', 'becoming', 'stranded', 'outback', 'instead', 'relatively', 'straight', 'forward', 'plane', 'crash', 'film', 'bizarre', 'scenario', 'family', 'picnic', 'gone', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'Fathers', 'committing', 'murder-suicides', 'families', 'was', 'virtually', 'unheard', '1971', 'unfortunately', 'too', 'common', 'today', 'teenage', 'girl', 'barely', 'school-age', 'brother', 'venture', 'wilderness', 'symbols', 'British', 'ruling', 'class', 'starched', 'school', 'uniforms', 'stark', 'contrasts', 'wilderness', 'Jenny', 'Agutter', 'film', 'teenage', 'girl', 'perspective', 'experience', 'journey', 'relationship', 'aborigine', 'boy', 'timeless', 'universal', 'yet', 'fraught', 'social', 'divisions', 'cultural', 'confusion', 'experiences', 'British', 'schoolgirl', 'patronizes', 'aborigine', 'even', 'survival', 'pubescent', 'teenage', 'girl', 'finds', 'close', 'corners', 'pubescent', 'teenage', 'boy', 'sexual', 'undercurrent', 'understated', 'obvious', 'beautifully', 'rendered', 'ultimately', 'tragic', 'tentative', 'uneasy', 'relationship', 'white', 'school', 'girl', 'aborigine', 'boy', 'metaphor', 'relationship', 'white', 'colonists', 'natives', 'whole', 'story', 'childhood', 'last', 'gasp', 'longing', 'hold', 'freedom', 'once', 'had', 'when', 'serious', 'choices', 'were', 'ahead']",N/A

They don't say much.In an unexplained change of scenery, they are out in the middle of the Australian outback in a Volkswagon Beetle.

The girl and the little boy wander around, not saying much.Eventually, a teenage Aboriginal finds them, solving the food and water problem they haven't mentioned.

For so many years, I waited for this movie to be available on home video. I saw it when it was originally released to theatres, and remembered it with such fondness. I was giddy with joy when I finally got a copy.The film now has that vaunted five or so many minutes of footage restored to it. None of the critics, who went on and on about the film and the great new footage, bothered to mention what that addition consists of. So I will tell you--it consists of animals being brutally killed, skinned, cut apart, devoured. Which totally changes the aspect of the movie. One of the previews before the film has a clip from a review saying the brief amount of violence is necessary. Thus, the review does not apply here at all. It is an ugly, barren, cruel in the extreme film.Nicholas Roeg has managed to destroy the novel, ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"" and the story, ""Don't Look Now."" He is equally superb with this movie. The film itself is pretty lame as well. I must have lost some of my idealism since I first saw it. Or I must have grown past movies like this.To have Jenny Agutter moaning at the end, remembering the great days of her youth and the walkabout and how nostalgic it all was and better than the humdrum life she is now leading, is laughable. I'll take humdrum any day of the week over almost dying in the wilderness, almost starving and thirsting to death, with flies eating the moisture out of my eyes. Come on! You'd have to be a moron to miss that.The movie tries to be profound, symbollic. The native finally decides his ultimate fate because, partially, he is sickened by hunters killing animals, without allowing them dignity in dying. This same native who just murders animals all over the place with such gusto and joy and bloodlust like I've never witnessed before, is just slightly hypocritical about the whole thing. Agutter is a wonderful actress and is the only reason to see the film at all.I sat through the thing, looking, I imagine like Cletus the Slack Jawed Yokel, with my jaw dropped throughout. I couldn't quite believe what I was seeing. It is, I feel, the job of the critic to warn us about certain movies, so we will know what we are getting into. John Canby did it years ago about a film involving extreme violence. It should have been done here as well.

25140,A2582KMXLK2P06,0780020847,B. E Jackson,"[0, 3]","Walkabout is one of the strangest movies I've seen in a while, and I definitely believe it's because the film was released over 40 years ago when adventure movie cliches weren't around yet.  You see back then the music wasn't the *only* groundbreaking phenomenon occurring- apparently adventure films were in the developmental stages as well.It's about a father who drives his daughter and young son into the Austalian desert and, for no reason whatsoever, waits for them to exit the car and walk several yards away and then literally SHOOTS AT THEM WITH A GUN while listening to Rod Stewart's ""Gasoline Alley"" on the radio!  Isn't that just unbelievably sick and crazy???  The way the shots were ricocheting off the rocks was just surreal and too graphic for my liking!Anyway the man then shoots and kills himself along with blowing the only way to get back to familiar territory, the car up, thus leaving the kids alone in the desert to fend for themselves.  From here the adventure gets underway.  They stumble upon a tree of life in one segment and I swear the music playing in the background was similar to Mike Oldfield's late 70's work which is considered highly original and influential but I have to question that considering identical music was released in the early 70's when THIS movie came out.  As a huge music fan and especially someone who seeks originality, I have to question how significant Oldfield's work really is when a piece like that is playing several years before his work was released.Eventually the daughter and son meet an African guy throwing harpoons at wild animals and... speaking of wild animals, this movie does a great job showing the wildlife that's over in Australia.  VERY dangerous wildlife might I add, with porcupines, lizards, kangaroos and, in one segment, what appeared to be a baby bear cub walking around while the teenage girl and her brother were sleeping.Anyway the storyline is obviously about finding someone who can rescue them so the sun doesn't burn them to death, and it's a decent story but in the end it's nothing we haven't already seen before in several other movies.  The only significant difference is that all the animal slaughters we encounter later on makes this a dark adventure.Also maybe it was just me since I have very little experience with kids, but it was very difficult to understand the little boy not just because of his Australian accent but just because little kids are hard to understand.Overall, decent movie but nothing to write home about.",3,oddly appealing,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,2522,"['Walkabout', 'one', 'strangest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'definitely', 'believe', 'film', 'was', 'released', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'adventure', 'movie', 'cliches', 'were', ""n't"", 'around', 'yet', 'see', 'back', 'then', 'music', 'was', ""n't"", '*only*', 'groundbreaking', 'phenomenon', 'occurring-', 'apparently', 'adventure', 'films', 'were', 'developmental', 'stages', 'well.It', 'father', 'who', 'daughter', 'young', 'son', 'Austalian', 'desert', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'waits', 'exit', 'car', 'walk', 'several', 'yards', 'away', 'then', 'literally', 'SHOOTS', 'AT', 'THEM', 'WITH', 'A', 'GUN', 'listening', 'Rod', 'Stewart', 'Gasoline', 'Alley', 'radio', ""n't"", 'that', 'just', 'unbelievably', 'sick', 'crazy', 'way', 'shots', 'were', 'ricocheting', 'off', 'rocks', 'was', 'just', 'surreal', 'too', 'graphic', 'liking', 'Anyway', 'man', 'then', 'shoots', 'kills', 'blowing', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'back', 'familiar', 'territory', 'car', 'up', 'thus', 'leaving', 'kids', 'alone', 'desert', 'fend', 'here', 'adventure', 'underway', 'stumble', 'tree', 'life', 'one', 'segment', 'swear', 'music', 'playing', 'background', 'was', 'similar', 'Mike', 'Oldfield', 'late', '70', 'work', 'considered', 'highly', 'original', 'influential', 'have', 'question', 'considering', 'identical', 'music', 'was', 'released', 'early', '70', 'when', 'THIS', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'huge', 'music', 'fan', 'especially', 'someone', 'who', 'originality', 'have', 'question', 'how', 'significant', 'Oldfield', 'work', 'really', 'when', 'piece', 'playing', 'several', 'years', 'work', 'was', 'released.Eventually', 'daughter', 'son', 'meet', 'African', 'guy', 'throwing', 'harpoons', 'wild', 'animals', 'speaking', 'wild', 'animals', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'wildlife', 'over', 'Australia', 'VERY', 'dangerous', 'wildlife', 'might', 'add', 'porcupines', 'lizards', 'kangaroos', 'one', 'segment', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'baby', 'bear', 'cub', 'walking', 'around', 'teenage', 'girl', 'brother', 'were', 'sleeping.Anyway', 'storyline', 'obviously', 'finding', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'rescue', 'so', 'sun', ""n't"", 'burn', 'death', 'decent', 'story', 'end', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'several', 'other', 'movies', 'only', 'significant', 'difference', 'animal', 'slaughters', 'encounter', 'later', 'dark', 'adventure.Also', 'maybe', 'was', 'just', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'experience', 'kids', 'was', 'very', 'difficult', 'understand', 'little', 'boy', 'not', 'just', 'Australian', 'accent', 'just', 'little', 'kids', 'are', 'hard', 'understand.Overall', 'decent', 'movie', 'nothing', 'write', 'home']",N/A

More of an expeience than a mere movie this is one of the great films that few people have seen due to its long unavailablity in the home market.The Criterion edition solves this problem. The film is presented unedited in the director's choice of aspect ratio. The film is not without problems in its presentation due largely to the age of the source material. Both video and audio are as good as we are likely to get on this small essentially art house release.The film tells the story of a boy (Lucien JoJohn Roeg) and his teenaged sister (Jenny Agutter) who are abandoned in the Austrailian outback after being taken on a picnic in which their father commits suicide. Helping them survive is an Aborigine (David Gulpilil) who is on his ritual walkabout between childhood and adulthood.The film juxtaposes several themes: the primitive vs. the civilized, the innocent vs the knowing, life in the city vs. life in the wilderness. The movie is not merely a story of survival. It is a story of innocence and how chices made in youth can have a dramatic affect on the future. The idea of communication is centraL. Tragedy occurs when two people either fail to communicate or can't communicate on the same level. The failure to communicate can be both based on language differences or because of preconceived notions about how society feels one should act. It is when feelings are rejected that disaster results.To comment anymore would be to give away too much of the film.

Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter""","[10, 13]","&quot;Walkabout&quot; is a beautiful film about how people adapt to new  environments yet are irreversibly shaped by their old ones.The film is  about a brother and sister whose father takes them on a picnic in the  Australian outback and for some inexplicable reason attempts to shoot them.  When he fails to accomplish this, the father kills himself and destroys his  vehicle so that the children are stranded in the outback.The children  wonder through the outback in an attempt to reach civilization. At first  the daughter (played by the beautiful Jenny Agutter) attempts to maintain  an illusion of control and civilized behavior. Despite the fact that she  and her brother are now in a natural environment with its own requirements,  she compels him to wear his blazer and school hat.Eventually, they meet  and are rescued by a young aborigine who is surviving in the outback on his  own as a rite of passage. This rite is called the walkabout--hence the  title of the film. As time passes, the children literally and symbolically  shed their social garb. They dress with little or no clothing and attune  themselves to the wild. The teenaged sister develops physical relations  with the aborigine while the younger brother (who is still a child) begins  to learn his language.Eventually the party reaches an outcrop of  civilization and the story comes to its climactic end. The sister  immediately resumes her civilized identity and distances herself from the  aborigine. Tragically, the aborigine chooses this moment to court her  according to the custom of his people. Where this might have been  acceptable to the sister in the outback it merely repulses her in  civilization. The aborigine hangs himself and the sister dresses her  brother in his hat and blazer and continues toward on to civilization. At  the end of the film she is married and living in her parents' former  apartment. Her husband comes home to tell her about his new promotion at  work, but her mind is occupied with recollections of life in the  outback.The film operates on several levels. On one level, it is a story  of paradise found and then relinquished. On another level the film explores  how subjective &quot;normalcy&quot; is. In one scene the aborigine shoots  and chops up a kangaroo. The image is grisly until the film mixes it with  shots of a uniformed butcher chopping meat. The scene suggests that beneath  our layers we all have the same basic needs and are operating on the same  level. But far from arguing about the universal quality of all things, the  film demonstrates how the environment is the determining factor of human  behavior. The children cannot survive the outback unless they adapt to it,  which is something the aborigine teaches them to do. The aborigine cannot  survive in civilization unless he changes who and what he is.Ultimately, while people can adapt to new environments in this film,  they cannot shed their original identities.

The basic weakness in the movie is the lack of clarity in the boy's motivations and the ending.Spoilers...I felt confused about why the boy killed himself. Having also read the book, I know that he took his own life in the written story; it seems like the movie decided that was the best way to end as well. But while the book is very clear why the boy chose to die, the movie is not.I had previously assumed that the boy chose to end it because the girl rejected his romantic advances. But that did not seem so clear when I watched it this time.The boy becomes depressed the day before when he sees some white hunters killing buffalo. It's not really clear why this affected him so much. Was it the use of a rifle to do the killing? Why should that matter?  After becoming depressed, the boy spends the night in an animal graveyard and awakens the next morning with his skin painted up as a skeleton. Then he returns to the where the children are camping and performs his dance.Most people seem to think this is a courtship dance, but, if so, it left me very confused. Do you do a courtship dance when you are depressed and disguised as a skeleton? It looked more like a death dance to me. Maybe it was his way of exhausting himself so that he would be able to die quickly by hanging in the tree.I also couldn't avoid wondering if a young aboriginal man would acutally have any interest in the white girl. Beauty is basically a set of cultural attitudes, and primitive cultures usually have strict traditions of kinship and other considerations when looking for a mate. Would a hunter/gatherer in a harsh wildnerness choose a mate who was completely helpless and unable to contribute to survival?Basically, this whole romance theme seemed out of place to me. The part that still worked for me was the contrast between the boy's basic good nature and generosity with the various civilized white people:  the crazy dad, the perverse bunch of losers at the weather balloon station, and the watchman at the settlement where the children end up...""Don't touch that, don't touch anything.

It has stuck with all of us since and gone on to be my single most enjoyed film.  Before it came out on VHS much less DVD I was only able to see it at the local art house movie theatre.  The good part was that, of course, I could see it on the big screen.  I always made it a point to invite someone I knew who had not yet seen it.  They would always be amazed at the beauty, the uniqueness of the story, the tone of the film and the emotional music.  My wife bought me the VHS tape a few years ago and it was the perfect gift.  I've listed my favorite 280 films and it remains firmly entrenched as #1 despite other great films being made over the years.It should probably be rated PG or PG-13 due to two scenes, neither of which are graphic but place the film above the level of an otherwise excellent movie for the family.  I'd say any kid over age 12 would be appropriate.I never tire of seeing this movie.  It reminds me of a film version of reggae or of listening to Ray Charles with the distinct tone he can set, particularly in his early years of heartache songs.  This takes you instantly to a different pacing of life once the characters are out of the city and in the outback.At the core of the film is the merging of two very different cultures.  What becomes clear when this happens anywhere on earth is what we share in common with each other, regardless of our upbringing.  Australia is also revealed in all its raw beauty, enough to be a major element of the film, almost another character.  The director's sense of his subject, of the proper tone to be set for this film is very evident.  He is in control, he is our guide into this world and, trusting him, we are rewarded with a story of love, loss, cultures clashing, wild Australian outback, native Australian merging with UK root Australians and all in the hands of three individuals who are a child and teenagers.The innocence of the boy is a great treat in this film.  He is able to be a bridge between the two cultural worlds with little effort while his teenage sister and the aboriginy youth are virtually unable to cross that divide.I've just ordered the Criterion DVD and can't wait to see the director's cut.  I can't recommend this film enough for anyone 12 or older.

25149,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,0780020847,C. O. DeRiemer,"[15, 17]","It's unsettling to find that something you've treasured, now seen or met again, leaves you feeling a little flat. Did you change for the worse...have you become jaded...less open about feeling emotion? Or perhaps what you liked so much then simply isn't the wonder you thought it was.A young girl (Jenny Agutter), 14, and her brother (billed as Lucien John, who actually was Nicolas Roeg's son, Luc) about 7, are driven far into the Australian outback by their father for a picnic. We've seen the family...the children at school, the mother preparing food while she smokes and looks distracted, the daughter swimming in the pool of their expensive apartment building, the father a businessman who stares out the window at her. For the picnic, the mother has stayed at home. The father is preoccupied in the car. He stops and the daughter lays out the food while her brother runs about among rocks. A shot rings out and the bullet hits the rocks by the boy. The father is firing. The daughter runs to her brother and scoops him up to hide. He shoots at them several more times, then demands that they come back so that they can return home. After a pause the father pours gasoline on the car, ignites it and shoots himself. The children are stranded in the middle of scrub desert with only what little food they can carry. They start walking. They eventually find some muddy water and fruit, but in the morning the water has disappeared and the fruit has all been eaten by birds. And they meet a 16-year-old Aboriginal boy (David Gulpilil) who is doing walkabout, the months' long initiation to manhood where he must survive, or not survive, by himself.The heart of the story is how he helps them survive, how he looks after them, how sexual feelings arise, how the girl is shaped by her conventional attitudes and is unaware of the boy except as someone who will take them back to civilization, how the boy is shaped by his tribal rituals and has no other way to express himself. The climax of the boy's feelings and his attempt to express them is poignant and sad.The film, however, is punctuated at the beginning and end and occasionally throughout with shots of civilized life which appear to make civilization less appealing than the primitive and direct life the boy brings to the girl and her brother. Is butchering to bring meat to the supermarket really any different than butchering a kangaroo or a lizard? Doesn't the treatment of Aborigines as children compare unfavorably with the resourcefulness and cheerfulness of the boy? Isn't killing for food better than using high-powered rifles to kill animals for sport? The movie is oblique enough so that these ""civilized"" moments don't overpower the basic story, but they are still there. Viewing the film now, they seemed unnecessary intrusions into what remains a very strong and affecting story of two young people utterly unable to communicate because of their own conventions.The movie is beautifully photographed. Two sequences stand out for me. In one, after days in the desert and scrub, the three find themselves walking on through a forest of eucalyptus trees, palms and green scrub. The little brother is trotting along with the young man telling him a long and involved story about a boy on a ladder. Not a word is understood but they both enjoy the experience. The other sequence is in an abandoned, ruined farm house. The young man has painted himself and is dancing what appears to be a ritual of declaration to the girl. He can't express himself any other way and she can only show that she is frightened. He dances until he is exhausted. In the morning she and her brother find him in a resolution that is quite sad.This is on balance a wonderful movie that, for me, hasn't aged as well as I thought it would.

25154,A280GY5UVUS2QH,0780020847,Doug Anderson,"[5, 6]","Civilization is mad, or drives people mad is the opening proposition in Roegs 1971 Walkabout, and yet modern man is ill equipped to live outside of it. The script has everything a cinematagrapher would want. An interesting story but not one that needs to be elaborated upon or explained. Early on an incident occurs in the outback and the rest of the movie traces two childrens journey back to civilization. The story relies not on dialogue but on visual data almost exclusively. There have been few movies that have been so perfectly filmed(Lawrence of Arabia is one that comes to mind, on which Roeg served as cinematographer). The beauty of Roegs images of the Australian wild and also the beauty of the young actress Jenny Agutter alone make this a very memorable film but also with that camera Roeg is making a very provocative study of human nature in two distinct elements.  And the competence with which he does so puts the film in the very highest class.This film was made in Australia during the decade that countries cinema went through a boom period. But also during a time when international cinema was exploring similar topics. The most similar film to Walkabout I can think of is Antonioni's Zabriskie Point. I think the two would compliment each other very well if viewed in tandem.Many Australian films of the 70's deal with nature with an element of mysticism added in for good measure, usually  mysticism derived from Aboriginal customs, and this film does touch on that topic as the children are led back to civilization by an Aborigine but the film does not dabble in the mystic or become lost in its allure as some of the other Australian films did, it simply acknowledges that there are ways of perceiving reality other than western ones.  That theme of getting back to nature is appealing to me anyway but Roegs treatment of it is never sentimental or romantic and that too is appealing. In fact what really gives the film its special depth and appeal is that the children still not completely indoctrinated into civilizations ways attempt to adapt to their primal surroundings but find they cannot, they are saved only because they are found by an Aboriginal child who provides them with food and guides them back to the world they came from but the odyssey has been a strikingly filmed one.  Roegs camera has been very effective in finding the most poignant images to convey how differently the world is perceived when in nature and when in civilization. An intriguing study by one of the worlds greatest cinematographers using very modern devices to penetrate to the heart of one of civilized mans oldest attractions, the return to nature.",5,Another world just out of reach,1007510400,"12 5, 2001",2001,2666,"['Civilization', 'mad', 'people', 'mad', 'opening', 'proposition', 'Roegs', '1971', 'Walkabout', 'yet', 'modern', 'man', 'ill', 'equipped', 'live', 'script', 'everything', 'cinematagrapher', 'would', 'want', 'interesting', 'story', 'not', 'one', 'be', 'elaborated', 'explained', 'Early', 'incident', 'outback', 'rest', 'movie', 'two', 'childrens', 'journey', 'back', 'civilization', 'story', 'not', 'dialogue', 'visual', 'data', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'perfectly', 'filmed', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'one', 'mind', 'Roeg', 'served', 'cinematographer', 'beauty', 'Roegs', 'images', 'Australian', 'wild', 'also', 'beauty', 'young', 'actress', 'Jenny', 'Agutter', 'alone', 'make', 'very', 'memorable', 'film', 'also', 'camera', 'Roeg', 'making', 'very', 'provocative', 'study', 'human', 'nature', 'two', 'distinct', 'elements', 'competence', 'so', 'puts', 'film', 'very', 'highest', 'class.This', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Australia', 'decade', 'countries', 'cinema', 'went', 'boom', 'period', 'also', 'time', 'when', 'international', 'cinema', 'was', 'exploring', 'similar', 'topics', 'most', 'similar', 'film', 'can', 'think', 'Antonioni', 'Zabriskie', 'Point', 'think', 'two', 'would', 'compliment', 'other', 'very', 'well', 'viewed', 'tandem.Many', 'Australian', 'films', '70', 'deal', 'nature', 'element', 'mysticism', 'added', 'good', 'measure', 'usually', 'mysticism', 'derived', 'Aboriginal', 'customs', 'film', 'touch', 'topic', 'children', 'are', 'led', 'back', 'civilization', 'Aborigine', 'film', 'not', 'dabble', 'mystic', 'become', 'lost', 'allure', 'other', 'Australian', 'films', 'did', 'simply', 'are', 'ways', 'perceiving', 'reality', 'other', 'western', 'ones', 'theme', 'getting', 'back', 'nature', 'appealing', 'anyway', 'Roegs', 'treatment', 'never', 'sentimental', 'romantic', 'too', 'appealing', 'fact', 'what', 'really', 'film', 'special', 'depth', 'appeal', 'children', 'still', 'not', 'completely', 'indoctrinated', 'civilizations', 'ways', 'attempt', 'adapt', 'primal', 'surroundings', 'find', 'can', 'not', 'are', 'saved', 'only', 'are', 'found', 'Aboriginal', 'child', 'who', 'food', 'back', 'world', 'came', 'odyssey', 'been', 'strikingly', 'filmed', 'one', 'Roegs', 'camera', 'been', 'very', 'effective', 'finding', 'most', 'poignant', 'images', 'convey', 'how', 'differently', 'world', 'perceived', 'when', 'nature', 'when', 'civilization', 'intriguing', 'study', 'one', 'worlds', 'greatest', 'cinematographers', 'using', 'very', 'modern', 'devices', 'penetrate', 'heart', 'one', 'civilized', 'mans', 'oldest', 'attractions', 'return', 'nature']",N/A
25155,A2UUWETDYA2EKV,0780020847,Douglas Doepke,"[7, 8]","This visually stunning 1971 movie anticipates many of today's main social and environmental topics.At its core, Walkabout is about cultural dominance: the capacity of European culture to dominate both nature and other peoples. Central to this dominance - as the film indicates - are discipline (the girl's fortitude in confronting the outback), conformity to rules (her rote recitation and dress code), hierarchy (unquestioned obedience, even to a deranged father), subjugation of nature (wild animal slaughter), private property (the station in the outback, the despoiled mine), white privilege (the aborigine is useful and nothing more), but most of all, dominance requires replacement of instinct with institutions and nature with technology. Older viewers will recognize counter-cultural themes of the 1960's.Nicholas Roeg has organized these ideas in interesting ways that keep eyes glued to the screen. However, there is a real need to pay attention to the visual imagery which in Walkabout amounts to a dominant text, with the rather sparse dialogue acting as a subtext. Or put another way, in Walkabout Roeg is making a movie, not writing a play. Thus the opening sequence of imagery indicates reasons for the father's derangement and suicide, while crotch shots of the tree indicate the mating potential of boy and girl, a tension that is otherwise hard to convey since the aborigine boy speaks no English.Roeg's wise refusal to sentimentalize his characters gives the movie much of its strength. Instead, the main characters are treated in straightforward, non-judgemental fashion. Nevertheless, as other reviewers point out, the movie does make a statement. Namely, that the girl comes to regret her return to 'civilization', failing to realize at the time the natural paradise she had found on her walkabout. This rejection amounts to a telling commentary on the price the dominant culture has exacted from us in its demand for well-ordered 'progress'. While I agree with the spirit of the point, I think Roeg has idealized the contrast. After all, swimming, fishing, and roaming, look good from the standpoint of the closeted office in the big city. Yet millions of rural people to whom such simple pleasures are in some semblance available, leave those surroundings for the excitement only a big city can provide. In that sense, the girl's regret at movie's end can be taken as a coming to terms with the problems of modern European culture, rather than a return-to-nature as their oversimplified solution. Anyway, however you might choose to cut it, the movie is certainly worth a look see.",5,Culture clash,996710400,"08 2, 2001",2001,2605,"['visually', 'stunning', '1971', 'movie', 'many', 'today', 'main', 'social', 'environmental', 'topics.At', 'core', 'Walkabout', 'cultural', 'dominance', 'capacity', 'European', 'culture', 'dominate', 'nature', 'other', 'peoples', 'Central', 'dominance', 'film', 'are', 'discipline', 'girl', 'fortitude', 'confronting', 'outback', 'conformity', 'rules', 'rote', 'recitation', 'dress', 'code', 'hierarchy', 'unquestioned', 'obedience', 'even', 'deranged', 'father', 'subjugation', 'nature', 'wild', 'animal', 'slaughter', 'private', 'property', 'station', 'outback', 'despoiled', 'mine', 'white', 'privilege', 'aborigine', 'useful', 'nothing', 'more', 'most', 'dominance', 'replacement', 'instinct', 'institutions', 'nature', 'technology', 'Older', 'viewers', 'will', 'recognize', 'counter-cultural', 'themes', ""1960's.Nicholas"", 'Roeg', 'organized', 'ideas', 'interesting', 'ways', 'keep', 'eyes', 'glued', 'screen', 'However', 'real', 'need', 'pay', 'attention', 'visual', 'imagery', 'Walkabout', 'amounts', 'dominant', 'text', 'rather', 'sparse', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'subtext', 'put', 'way', 'Walkabout', 'Roeg', 'making', 'movie', 'not', 'writing', 'play', 'Thus', 'opening', 'sequence', 'imagery', 'reasons', 'father', 'derangement', 'suicide', 'crotch', 'shots', 'tree', 'indicate', 'mating', 'potential', 'boy', 'girl', 'tension', 'otherwise', 'hard', 'convey', 'aborigine', 'boy', 'English.Roeg', 'wise', 'refusal', 'sentimentalize', 'characters', 'movie', 'much', 'strength', 'Instead', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'treated', 'straightforward', 'non-judgemental', 'fashion', 'Nevertheless', 'other', 'reviewers', 'point', 'out', 'movie', 'make', 'statement', 'Namely', 'girl', 'regret', 'return', ""'civilization"", 'failing', 'realize', 'time', 'natural', 'paradise', 'had', 'found', 'walkabout', 'rejection', 'telling', 'commentary', 'price', 'dominant', 'culture', 'exacted', 'demand', 'well-ordered', ""'progress"", 'agree', 'spirit', 'point', 'think', 'Roeg', 'idealized', 'contrast', 'swimming', 'fishing', 'roaming', 'look', 'good', 'standpoint', 'closeted', 'office', 'big', 'city', 'millions', 'rural', 'people', 'whom', 'such', 'simple', 'pleasures', 'are', 'semblance', 'available', 'leave', 'surroundings', 'excitement', 'only', 'big', 'city', 'can', 'provide', 'sense', 'girl', 'regret', 'movie', 'end', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'coming', 'terms', 'problems', 'modern', 'European', 'culture', 'rather', 'return-to-nature', 'oversimplified', 'solution', 'Anyway', 'however', 'might', 'choose', 'cut', 'movie', 'certainly', 'worth', 'look', 'see']",N/A

A couple of times, I was half-expecting to see Rod Serling pop up on-screen & tell me how so & so has just entered the twilight zone. I'm not talking about the behavoir of the Aborigines, either. I'm referring to the other Australians. A few of these scenes don't seem to ""fit"" at all with the rest of the storyline.The balance of the movie, however, is simply breathtaking. The plot centers around a boy and his big sister who are lost in the outback & trying to find their way back to civilization. Along the way, they must combat the austere elements of desert-like landscapes and must cope with unforgivingly harsh environments. Luckily, they come across a 16 year old Aborigine male who is undergoing his isolated rite to prove himself as a man (known as the walkabout).Jenny Agutter has a very natural screen presence, which is more than a little refreshing in this day & age. Too many times, actors these days ""try too hard"" to do a good job & their performances come off as stilted. Agutter is young, tender & innocent and is everything she's supposed to be.If you're looking for an aesthetically pleasing panoramic spectacle, this movie is for you. The exotic wildlife, lush scenery, gorgeous sunsets, the music of John Barry & the lithe, nude form of Agutter all combine to create a visually stunning film. There are many parts that have a very surreal feel to them.The thrust of the movie is the importance of being at one with nature in a more-or-less Taoistic sense. It is ironic that, at the end, all Agutter's character can think about is how pleasant it was to live in the wild with her Aborigine friend.

I suppose it was a bit too racy for American audiences as Roeg focuses lovingly on a young nubile Jenny Augutter but that would be missing the point of this movie which contrasts the sterile life of a young British girl and boy with an Aborigine man-child.The film depicts the initial bleakness of the Australian desert which the two children find themselves thrust into after the father mysteriously chooses to commit suicide, but eventually shows the immense diversity of the outback as the young Aborigine leads the lost children back to civilization.  Roeg uses a variety of cinematic techniques to paste together his poetic vision, ultimately developing the sexual tension between Agutter and the Aborigine, culminating in a fateful courting ritual which Agutter appears oblivious too.  However, the star of the movie is the little boy, Luc Roeg, who forms a very special bond with the Aborigine.The film may be too much to handle for small children, but it is ideal for teenagers, as it will give them a very different experience from the run-of-the-mill teen movies that proliferate in the video stores.

After viewing this film I can confirm the fact that it truly is. The cinematography that this film has to offer of the Australian outback is nothing short of spectacular. The ingenious camerawork and use of special effects to bend the picture here and there really makes you feel as if you are journeying with the Sister and the Brother throughout the Australian outback with their Aborigine guide. The story is quite simple: After witnessing the suicide of the father, a sister and her brother must make their way throughout the Australian outback and try to find their way home. On the way, near death, they come across an Aborigine teenager, who is on his Walkabout, the rite of passage for every male Aborigine. With his help, they are able to survive and trek across the Outback. However it is when the scenes of the camp of Caucasians are shown, using the Aborigines as labor workers that the film starts to falter a bit. It loses it's simple story of the journey,  which was just enough in fact and even more so to keep me interested. I can see what the director was trying to show with this, but it really did not move the story ahead at all. In fact it slowed it down for me and made it a bit tedious. Once the Aborigine tries to court the girl, the movie picks up again, and soars spectacularly all the way to the finish. All in all, it was a very good film, but with it's flaws.

Rescued by David Gulpilil (The Last Wave, Crocodile Dundee, Rabbit Proof Fence) an Aborigine on walkabout they manage to survive with his help and support. However tragedy is looming in the distance, for despite everything Gulpilil has done for the children he can never enter ""their"" civilized ""white"" world, and though Jenny is fond of him she is unable to reciprocate his love and his suicide is a tragic consequence of their relationship.This is a film about differences that can never be bridged. Black and White are forever condemned to inhabit different worlds, but the irony here is that without the Aborigine Agutter and Roeg would never have survived in the Outback alone.I especially liked the ending when Agutter, now married to a boring white man, reminisces the past, slowly becoming aware of what she lost because of her prejudice and unyielding nature.

25170,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,0780020847,K. Driscoll,"[5, 6]","Walkabout is introduced in the film as an important period in the life of an Aborigine. A time at the age of sixteen or so that the man-child must survive in the bush by himself for six months. If he survives he is a man, if not...well he really isn't anything because he's probably dead. Going into the film my understanding of Walkabout was sort of a break from white society into the traditional Aboriginal lifestyle for a period of time. The other use of Walkabout that I have heard is in reference to a British Monarch or some higher level of person walking around greeting folks in the public. Director Nicholas Roeg seems to understand the various uses of this word as well and ties them in with the maturation of the film's core characters. The parallels make for some very exciting social commentary and the film subtly layers itself and it's characters further and further. For that, Roeg's film in perspective can be seen as two very different kinds of films and split it's audience enormously. One crowd may say that Walkabout is extremely slow and boring while the other crowd will hail the film as a fantastic artistic achievement. Understandably so for both sides I suppose, but I do count myself among the latter group.Walkabout follows two young English kids, one a fourteen-year-old girl and the other a six-year-old boy (I think) as they are abandoned in the middle of the vast Australian outback. The abandonment itself is quite perplexing and I was fairly confused as to how it was handled, but you'll see that addressing those unanswered questions is not what Roeg's film sets out to do at all. Placing these children's survival in the arms of a 16 year old aborigine during his Walkabout is the stage that needs to be set to allow for some far more interesting questions that the audience can ask themselves about how we are all living. To paraphrase Lucas Haas in Tim Burton's ""Mars Attacks"", I wish we could all just live in Tee-pees...it would be better that way.  Who doesn't wield an idealistic anarcho-primitivist message deep in their hearts? It also makes some outstanding observations on maturing into manhood and womanhood. Anyway, let those inquiries enter your brain how you like, but know that this is a smart film that calls for some patience in exchange for it's great rewards. I'm getting a little fuzzy here and I really don't want to urge my own observations on you.There are aspects besides its pace that will turn some viewers away. Firstly, the violence against animals is real and pretty hard, so PETA activists beware.  Secondly, it was PG when it came out but the nudity shown here from Agutter is actually too graphic for R ratings today. Thirdly; again, this film is not exactly box office gold with its lower budget and slower pace, so if you find yourself unable to sit through films that don't contain explosions or CGI then you should pass as well.In a simple concluding scene that hits hard for me, the girl is now older and married, and she remembers back to when she didn't understand the things she knows now. It's a simple, melancholy and I believe universal feeling that's part of growing up.  Perhaps she loved the aboriginal boy that saved her life and she couldn't understand his advances as a child.  Perhaps she would now be willing to cross into that culture as she sees the truth now.  Then again, maybe she was just reflecting on what is no doubt a very unique and significant experience to her. Something those who surround her in adulthood could never fully understand.

25173,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,0780020847,Linda Linguvic,"[8, 11]","Originally released in 1971, this film is characterized by great cinematography of the Australian outback and the rather strange story of a lost English teenage girl and her little brother who are helped to survive by a 16-year old Australian Aboriginal boy on his ""walkabout"", a coming-of-age survival ritual.  The girl, played by Jenny Agutter, is steeped in the ways of civilization and always distrustful of the aboriginal boy, played by David Gulpilil.  The younger boy, played by Luc Roeg, is the son of the director, Nicolas Roeg, and does a fine job of bridging the gap between the two older teenagers as he learns some basic hunting skills and finds ways to communicate with the older boy.The story is a little too artsy for my taste and raises just too many unanswered questions.  Why did the children's father drive them out on the desert and start shooting at them?  Why did he commit suicide?  Why were there some strange scenes about scientists and a weather balloon?  Why did the girl never cease her upper class manners even when faced with starvation and fatigue?  Even though there are scenes showing the children washing their flannel school uniforms, how did they keep their clothes in such good condition?  And why was the film so horribly pessimistic?There's food for thought here though between the ways of life of the materialistic city dweller, which is contrasted by the natural way of the world.  However, neither of these ways of life comes out the winner, especially because there is no understanding between them.  No one is spared the director's harsh camera lens, which focuses a lot on the animals. We get the feeling survival means destroying other living things.  And it is the same with humans. The film is moody, pessimistic and surreal - not my favorite kind of movie. Its message is hazy and unfocussed.  And yet its haunting quality will linger with me for a long time.  I can't say I enjoyed this video.  Rather I was disturbed by it.  And I would have liked more clarity.  I do recommend it though for film buffs and art lovers.

25176,A1D2AXVN20OQZD,0780020847,Marc A. Coignard,"[67, 69]","In Gus Van Sant's Elephant, we follow several teenagers around for half a day, with little or no dialogue, and with nothing to connect us to the characters.  We watch a father drive his kid to school, drunk.  We watch three girls vomit in the bathroom after eating lunch.  We watch two teenagers shoot up the school, ala Columbine, all without any given reason.  That film won the Golden Palm and Best Director awards at the Cannes Film Festival.  Although I was not a fan of the film at all, in fact I was disgusted by it, I have learned to understand why Van Sant chose to shoot his film the way he did; little or not plot, and no back story for the characters, and little audience interaction with the characters.Walkabout is somewhat similar to the style that Van Sant used in Elephant, and reportadley also in his films Gerry and Last Days, but it was done over 30 years prior.  Its a beautiful film, told quite simply, over the course of an unkwown number of days.  We get to know the characters, but not through back story, or by seeing them in their daily lives.  The only thing we know about either one of them (the 14 year old girl and her six or seven year old brother) is that they are English living in Australia, and both attend prep-school...and even this is an assumption based on their language and uniforms, not on anything the film really tells us.The story, as told in every review, is about how the two are mystreriously brought to the outback by their father, who then tries to kill them, and then kills himself.  They are close to death as they wander through the desert, until a young Aborigine boy of 16 sees them and essentially rescues them.One reviewer complains that nothing happens.  I disagree, plenty happens.  Its random, as is nature, and nature is where these characters exist in this film.  Not alot is explained to us, nor do I think we are supposed to figure alot out.  We are supposed to watch, and see things as the characters see them.  I loved the way the film juxtapozed the Aborigine with the civilized world.  There is a harsh, yet amazing scene, where the Aborigine has killed a kangaroo and is cutting it up.  The scene is intercut with scenes of a butcher hacking up meat in his butcher shop.  Although it seems random at first, when viewed in the rest of the film, it fits in perfectly in the movie's method of comparing the similarites, despite the obvious differences, between the two cultures.As Roger Ebert pointed out in his The Great Movies II, communication is also a major subject of study in this film--meaning, there hardly is any.  The boy is somehow able to get through to the Aborigine, but the girl maintains her distance, probably by choice.  She was brought up upper-class, and no doubt that is the lifestyle she enjoys.  The Aborigine is no better.  He speaks his language throughout the film, as if the two English could understand him.  It doens't matter to him that they can't.  Neither side is innocent of close-mindedness in this respect.There is also a certain sexual under-tone in this film.  Some reviewers regarded the nudity as non-sexual.  For the most part, I'd agree.  However, the scene that was orignally cut from this film and restored in the lated 90s, is highly sexual.  While the Aborigine boy is out hunting, displaying his brutish masculinity, the girl is swimming naked in an oasis.  The scene is not sexual as most American audiences know it.  There is never a loving embrace between the two, and it hardly seems that she is at all attracted to him.  Also, she does not watch him hunt.  Yet to deny the sexual urges of either character throughout the film, displayed mostly in this scene (there is some evidence of it scattered througout, also) would mean that you've put up blinders.  True, no sex occurs, but the girls beautiful body is fully displayed at the same time as the young-man's raw masculitnity.  This is contrast to the nudity at the films very end, which is playful, but not in the least bit sexual.  Its a fine line, and the film's director has walked in well, without losing his balance.This was a beautiful film, and I'd love to see it again.  I urge the viewer not to expect much on story.  There is a plot--the white kids want to get home and the Aborigine helps them find it--but that is not the key focus.  The plot is the means to an end.  That end being a study of cultural differences, done in a very intellegent, patient, and much more interesting way than I've ever seen.",5,"Thank you again, Criterion",1123891200,"08 13, 2005",2005,4487,"['Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'Elephant', 'follow', 'several', 'teenagers', 'day', 'little', 'dialogue', 'nothing', 'connect', 'characters', 'watch', 'father', 'drive', 'kid', 'school', 'drunk', 'watch', 'three', 'girls', 'vomit', 'bathroom', 'eating', 'lunch', 'watch', 'two', 'teenagers', 'shoot', 'up', 'school', 'ala', 'Columbine', 'given', 'reason', 'film', 'won', 'Golden', 'Palm', 'Best', 'Director', 'awards', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'was', 'not', 'fan', 'film', 'fact', 'was', 'disgusted', 'have', 'learned', 'understand', 'why', 'Van', 'Sant', 'chose', 'shoot', 'film', 'way', 'did', 'little', 'not', 'plot', 'back', 'story', 'characters', 'little', 'audience', 'interaction', 'characters.Walkabout', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'style', 'Van', 'Sant', 'used', 'Elephant', 'reportadley', 'also', 'films', 'Gerry', 'Last', 'Days', 'was', 'done', '30', 'years', 'prior', 'beautiful', 'film', 'told', 'quite', 'simply', 'course', 'unkwown', 'number', 'days', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'not', 'back', 'story', 'seeing', 'daily', 'lives', 'only', 'thing', 'know', 'one', '14', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'six', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'brother', 'are', 'English', 'living', 'Australia', 'attend', 'prep-school', 'even', 'assumption', 'based', 'language', 'uniforms', 'not', 'anything', 'film', 'really', 'us.The', 'story', 'told', 'review', 'how', 'two', 'are', 'mystreriously', 'brought', 'outback', 'father', 'who', 'then', 'kill', 'then', 'are', 'close', 'death', 'wander', 'desert', 'young', 'Aborigine', 'boy', '16', 'sees', 'essentially', 'rescues', 'them.One', 'reviewer', 'nothing', 'disagree', 'plenty', 'happens', 'random', 'nature', 'nature', 'where', 'characters', 'exist', 'film', 'Not', 'alot', 'explained', 'do', 'think', 'are', 'supposed', 'figure', 'alot', 'are', 'supposed', 'watch', 'see', 'things', 'characters', 'see', 'loved', 'way', 'film', 'juxtapozed', 'Aborigine', 'civilized', 'world', 'harsh', 'yet', 'amazing', 'scene', 'where', 'Aborigine', 'killed', 'kangaroo', 'cutting', 'up', 'scene', 'intercut', 'scenes', 'butcher', 'hacking', 'up', 'meat', 'butcher', 'shop', 'random', 'first', 'when', 'viewed', 'rest', 'film', 'perfectly', 'movie', 'method', 'comparing', 'similarites', 'obvious', 'differences', 'two', 'cultures.As', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'pointed', 'out', 'Great', 'Movies', 'II', 'communication', 'also', 'major', 'subject', 'study', 'film', 'meaning', 'hardly', 'boy', 'somehow', 'able', 'get', 'Aborigine', 'girl', 'distance', 'probably', 'choice', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'upper-class', 'doubt', 'lifestyle', 'Aborigine', 'better', 'language', 'film', 'two', 'English', 'could', 'understand', 'matter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'side', 'innocent', 'close-mindedness', 'respect.There', 'also', 'certain', 'sexual', 'under-tone', 'film', 'reviewers', 'regarded', 'nudity', 'non-sexual', 'most', 'part', ""'d"", 'agree', 'However', 'scene', 'was', 'orignally', 'cut', 'film', 'restored', 'lated', '90s', 'highly', 'sexual', 'Aborigine', 'boy', 'out', 'hunting', 'displaying', 'brutish', 'masculinity', 'girl', 'swimming', 'naked', 'oasis', 'scene', 'not', 'sexual', 'most', 'American', 'audiences', 'know', 'never', 'loving', 'embrace', 'two', 'hardly', 'attracted', 'Also', 'not', 'watch', 'hunt', 'deny', 'sexual', 'urges', 'character', 'film', 'displayed', 'mostly', 'scene', 'evidence', 'scattered', 'througout', 'also', 'would', 'mean', ""'ve"", 'put', 'up', 'blinders', 'True', 'sex', 'girls', 'beautiful', 'body', 'fully', 'displayed', 'same', 'time', 'young-man', 'raw', 'masculitnity', 'contrast', 'nudity', 'films', 'very', 'end', 'playful', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'sexual', 'fine', 'line', 'film', 'director', 'walked', 'well', 'losing', 'balance.This', 'was', 'beautiful', 'film', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'again', 'urge', 'viewer', 'not', 'expect', 'much', 'story', 'plot', 'white', 'kids', 'want', 'get', 'home', 'Aborigine', 'find', 'not', 'key', 'focus', 'plot', 'means', 'end', 'end', 'being', 'study', 'cultural', 'differences', 'done', 'very', 'intellegent', 'patient', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'way', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen']",N/A
25177,A389E7NNXVGY90,0780020847,marcvdp,"[27, 30]","For some reasons I had reservations about seeing this film when I first heard about it; maybe because what I heard and the advertising I saw didn't begin to hint at its depth. Ostensibly its the story of two WASPs who get stranded in the Australian outback and meet an aborigine boy who helps them to surive their journey back to civilization. Most noticeably, for me, the movie criticizes the spiritual emptiness of civilized society and lets the viewer glimpse at some of uncharted territory's secret beauty. The movie works fine on this level. But its brilliance lies in how many different levels it does work, and its subtlety.It is a tragic story of two people who fail to communicate. The blindess of the girl (presented in quite a harsh light, and a symbolic big slap in the face to whitey now that I rethink it) despite huge language and cultural differences is inept or unwilling to understand the aborigine boy's perspective. Indeed she is deeply rooted in Anglo-Saxon values -- only the young boy, her companion, is able to break down the barrier and communicate simple ideas.There are points in the film that expose sexual tension as brilliantly and as subtley as I have ever seen. It is vastly important that the boy is not dramatized or stylized in any way, he seems really to have been picked out of the outback and cast directly in the movie. His behavior should seem at least somewhat bewildering to the audience, it was to me, particularly in the haunting mating dance scene. The girl rejects him out of a lack of understanding and fear, and he sheds tears of failure. Was sexual consumation a part of his walkabout or did he fall deeply for this girl. What are the cues to suggest the latter? I'd have to watch the movie again.Walkabout is delicate and complex but doesn't spoil itself by becoming overambitious. There are many, many internal psychological and emotional aspects of the two children that remain rightfully unexplored. Suffice to say being shot at by your dad and stranded in the wilderness might create some wrenching immediate -- nevermind longterm -- consequences. The film could easily have veered off into myriad branches and lost track of itself. Roeg decides to focus on particular elements and does so meticulously and with grace.And for the film's obvious disdain for civilized society, it doesn't necessarily suggest that the boy has an easier or more satisfying life. It merely presents a different angle -- though that angle is shot in breathtaking, but unsentimental, beauty.

Perhaps too much. And so, I was rather disappointed. It is a very interesting and beautifully photographed movie, but it has a number of defects that to a large extent ruined the experience for me.First of all, the movie script made two fundamental changes to the original book on which the movie is based, which are serious mistakes. In the book, the children's father dies as a result of an airplane accident in the Australian desert. This is a very reasonable and plausible dramatic mechanism to explain and justify the fact that the children find themselves lost and abandoned in the desert. In the movie, instead, the father kills himself, with an apparent half-hearted and failed attempt to kill his children as well. This whole scene is extremely unpleasant and makes little sense since nothing is explained about the reasons that might have driven him to not only kill himself but also to condemn his children to a horrible slow death in the desert.  Also, in the book the young aboriginal that helps the children to survive dies of a virus transmitted to him by the children. This makes sense since aboriginals had little contact with white people and therefore presumably their bodies have not developed defenses for many microbes carried by whites. In the movie, on the other hand, the aboriginal kills himself because the white girl does not respond to his mating dance, which seems extreme and not really credible.Another element in the movie I didn't like is that invariably all white characters are shown as highly unpleasant and even disgusting (the father of the children, the hunters, the Italian meteorologists, the company employee they find at the end) while all aboriginals are shown as very nice and good. I found this naive and simplistic.A final negative element is that the nude scenes of the children, particularly the beautiful 16 year-old girl, seemed somewhat exploitative to me. What was really the point of the long nude bath of the girl in the pond? A much shorter scene would have made the point better.",2,An interesting but flawed movie,1282867200,"08 27, 2010",2010,2167,"['Based', 'generally', 'positive', 'even', 'enthusiastic', 'reviews', 'most', 'professional', 'movie', 'critics', 'expected', 'lot', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'very', 'interesting', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'movie', 'number', 'defects', 'large', 'extent', 'ruined', 'experience', 'me.First', 'movie', 'script', 'made', 'two', 'fundamental', 'changes', 'original', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'are', 'serious', 'mistakes', 'book', 'children', 'father', 'result', 'airplane', 'accident', 'Australian', 'desert', 'very', 'reasonable', 'plausible', 'dramatic', 'mechanism', 'explain', 'justify', 'fact', 'children', 'find', 'lost', 'abandoned', 'desert', 'movie', 'instead', 'father', 'apparent', 'half-hearted', 'failed', 'attempt', 'kill', 'children', 'as', 'well', 'whole', 'scene', 'extremely', 'unpleasant', 'little', 'sense', 'nothing', 'explained', 'reasons', 'might', 'have', 'driven', 'not', 'only', 'kill', 'also', 'condemn', 'children', 'horrible', 'slow', 'death', 'desert', 'Also', 'book', 'young', 'aboriginal', 'children', 'survive', 'dies', 'virus', 'transmitted', 'children', 'sense', 'aboriginals', 'had', 'little', 'contact', 'white', 'people', 'therefore', 'presumably', 'bodies', 'have', 'not', 'developed', 'defenses', 'many', 'microbes', 'carried', 'whites', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'aboriginal', 'kills', 'white', 'girl', 'not', 'respond', 'mating', 'dance', 'extreme', 'not', 'really', 'credible.Another', 'element', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'invariably', 'white', 'characters', 'are', 'shown', 'highly', 'unpleasant', 'even', 'disgusting', 'father', 'children', 'hunters', 'Italian', 'meteorologists', 'company', 'employee', 'find', 'end', 'aboriginals', 'are', 'shown', 'very', 'nice', 'good', 'found', 'naive', 'simplistic.A', 'final', 'negative', 'element', 'nude', 'scenes', 'children', 'particularly', 'beautiful', '16', 'year-old', 'girl', 'seemed', 'somewhat', 'exploitative', 'What', 'was', 'really', 'point', 'long', 'nude', 'bath', 'girl', 'pond', 'much', 'shorter', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'point', 'better']",N/A

The movie, however full of natural dangers, however, does not focus so much upon the survivalism or even will to live so much as upon a coming-of-age involving a very dangerous and empty world.What makes it really distinct is not only said disregard for the civilities of survival-based exposition and important dialog, but the structuring of the film around three general editing devices that pull out a self-consciously artistic sense of malaise: jump cuts, graphic matches, and montage editing.  Several times the movie jumps ideas, locales, movements, pacing, shots, with seemingly very little reason, but which is usually just begging to be analyzed and commented upon.  This style of exposition is never anybody's favorite, and it's probably for that reason that this film isn't the most well-known film out there.Now of course the film seems to have this strong anti-human tendency, or even a strong anti-nature tendency, but neither of those readings really seem to pull through.  All there is in the film is what is, dangerous landscapes and abandoned buildings.  This fits completely with the coming-of-age malaise, the ever-present danger and the feeling of complete abandonment, but trying to fit in some sort of anti-human, anti-nature reading into this film is largely missing the point because it's not really taking into account the point of view of the protagonist, the young girl.  Can one honestly say she wasn't as intimidated by the nature aspects as by the human?Whatever the case, it is marked mostly by that deranged 70s artistic feel that is more famously felt in such works as Easy Rider and Taxi Driver, which means it's definitely not one of those things that sits well or can even be digested in one sitting.--PolarisDiB",5,A world full of danger and devoid of humanity,1139702400,"02 12, 2006",2006,2083,"['movie', 'simply', 'put', 'definitely', 'product', '70s.It', 'details', 'roughly', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'brother', 'who', 'disturbing', 'tragic', 'event', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'find', 'alone', 'Australian', 'wilderness', 'having', 'survive', 'relative', 'dangers', 'come', 'being', 'predicament', 'movie', 'however', 'full', 'natural', 'dangers', 'however', 'not', 'focus', 'so', 'much', 'survivalism', 'even', 'will', 'live', 'so', 'much', 'coming-of-age', 'involving', 'very', 'dangerous', 'empty', 'really', 'not', 'only', 'said', 'disregard', 'civilities', 'survival-based', 'exposition', 'important', 'dialog', 'structuring', 'film', 'three', 'general', 'editing', 'devices', 'pull', 'out', 'self-consciously', 'artistic', 'sense', 'malaise', 'jump', 'cuts', 'graphic', 'matches', 'montage', 'editing', 'Several', 'times', 'movie', 'ideas', 'locales', 'movements', 'pacing', 'shots', 'seemingly', 'very', 'little', 'reason', 'usually', 'just', 'begging', 'be', 'analyzed', 'commented', 'upon', 'style', 'exposition', 'never', 'anybody', 'favorite', 'probably', 'reason', 'film', ""n't"", 'most', 'well-known', 'film', 'there.Now', 'course', 'film', 'have', 'strong', 'anti-human', 'tendency', 'even', 'strong', 'anti-nature', 'tendency', 'readings', 'really', 'seem', 'pull', 'film', 'what', 'dangerous', 'landscapes', 'abandoned', 'buildings', 'completely', 'coming-of-age', 'malaise', 'ever-present', 'danger', 'feeling', 'complete', 'abandonment', 'trying', 'fit', 'sort', 'anti-human', 'anti-nature', 'reading', 'film', 'largely', 'missing', 'point', 'not', 'really', 'taking', 'account', 'point', 'view', 'protagonist', 'young', 'girl', 'Can', 'one', 'honestly', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'intimidated', 'nature', 'human', 'Whatever', 'case', 'marked', 'mostly', 'deranged', '70s', 'artistic', 'feel', 'more', 'famously', 'felt', 'such', 'works', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'definitely', 'not', 'one', 'things', 'well', 'can', 'even', 'be', 'digested', 'one', 'sitting.', 'PolarisDiB']",N/A

Having read the reviews on the film, it didn't sound all that appealing so I never felt interested enough to see it until now. And like others who have reviewed the film here that liked it, I also am not sure what director Nicolas Roeg(The man who fell to earth, Don't look now) was trying to say with this film. No doubt it's a strange blend of beautiful nature images, human sexual discovery, nudity, dead rotting animal carcasses Sometimes butchered in rather disturbing methods That brought to mind the brutal animal killings Deodato filmed for the sake of his movies Cannibal Holocaust and Jungle Holocaust. Many were offended by those sick depictions of animal killings for the sake of making a film, but no one seems to care that the same brutality happens to animals here as well. I find it disturbing that defenseless animals must suffer at the hands of human beings and lose their lives for the sake of what amounts to a pointless and boring art house film that seems to have very little redeeming qualities. It does have commentary about many things that is never explained and left for the viewer to understand as they wish. The film often feels more like a National Geographic exploration of wildlife in the outbacks of Australia than about two lost children trying to find their way back home. Several segments are interjected into the film that introduced (ever so briefly) characters who have no place in the story and you have no idea why they are there. Personally for the superb visuals it does deserve to be noticed for that, but otherwise its pretty boring and I hated seeing so many animals murdered for the sake of a film.",2,What was all the hype about?,1367884800,"05 7, 2013",2013,1795,"['Hailed', 'something', 'underground', 'art', 'house', 'classic', 'many', 'early', '70', 'was', 'actually', 'great', 'deal', 'talk', 'walkabout', 'back', 'then', 'Having', 'read', 'reviews', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'sound', 'appealing', 'so', 'never', 'felt', 'interested', 'enough', 'see', 'now', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'reviewed', 'film', 'here', 'liked', 'also', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'director', 'Nicolas', 'Roeg', 'man', 'who', 'fell', 'earth', 'Do', ""n't"", 'look', 'now', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'film', 'doubt', 'strange', 'blend', 'beautiful', 'nature', 'images', 'human', 'sexual', 'discovery', 'nudity', 'dead', 'rotting', 'animal', 'carcasses', 'Sometimes', 'butchered', 'rather', 'disturbing', 'methods', 'brought', 'mind', 'brutal', 'animal', 'killings', 'Deodato', 'filmed', 'sake', 'movies', 'Cannibal', 'Holocaust', 'Jungle', 'Holocaust', 'Many', 'were', 'offended', 'sick', 'depictions', 'animal', 'killings', 'sake', 'making', 'film', 'one', 'care', 'same', 'brutality', 'animals', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'find', 'disturbing', 'defenseless', 'animals', 'must', 'suffer', 'hands', 'human', 'beings', 'lose', 'lives', 'sake', 'what', 'amounts', 'pointless', 'boring', 'art', 'house', 'film', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'have', 'commentary', 'many', 'things', 'never', 'explained', 'left', 'viewer', 'understand', 'wish', 'film', 'often', 'more', 'National', 'Geographic', 'exploration', 'wildlife', 'outbacks', 'Australia', 'about', 'two', 'lost', 'children', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'home', 'Several', 'segments', 'are', 'interjected', 'film', 'introduced', 'ever', 'so', 'briefly', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'place', 'story', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'are', 'there', 'Personally', 'superb', 'visuals', 'deserve', 'be', 'noticed', 'otherwise', 'pretty', 'boring', 'hated', 'seeing', 'so', 'many', 'animals', 'murdered', 'sake', 'film']",N/A

The digital transfer was approved by Nicholas Roeg.But this is a Criterion Edition, so one expects some nice extras, and one is not disappointed.

I rented it because Jeff, the chronically oversexed character on the British sitcom Coupling, loves it. ""Jenny Agutter! Her name on a film is like an advertisement for nudity!"" Be that as it may, her film career has not really been an advertisement for good moviemaking; not that she's a bad actress, but I'm sure most involved want to forget such disasters as The Survivor, Child's Play 2, and the execrable Amazon Women on the Moon.In that light, there was a lot more to this movie than I expected. (Unfortunately, Jeff, the commentator from the preceding paragraph, is a bit too oversexed. If you're renting it for the nudity, fast-forward. A lot.) Agutter and her onscreen brother (Jon Roeg, son of director Nicolas), neither of whom are ever named in the film, begin on a picnic with an older man. He could be their father; he could be Agutter's much older husband. Critics seem to differ on this point. (For no apparent reason, I assumed the latter.) He is obviously not a happy, or stable, man, and he proves this by taking the family out to the desert, trying to kill them both, killing himself, and destroying the car in the process, leaving them stranded. The two attempt to make it back to civilization, and during their trip they meet an aboriginal boy (David Gulpilil, recently seen as Moodoo in Rabbit-Proof Fence) on walkabout, the traditional aboriginal coming-of-age ceremony.There are many layers to this movie, and Roeg (who studied under Truffaut; it shows) presents them as subtexts, for the most part. The obvious race-relations tack is at the forefront, but there are other oppositions in the film; man/woman, civilization/desert, etc. Roeg does a fine job of expressing the ineffable throughout, highlighting the things he want sot highlight with good camera work and then letting the viewer decide what's what.There is much to be enjoyed in Walkabout, but many viewers are going to find the pace of the movie to be, well, glacial. It is a very slow movie, as is to be expected with Agutter and Roeg being the film's only characters for a good portion of the time (and Gulpilil being the only other one for about 90% of the rest). The fiml's failings have to do with the introduction of civilization into the middle of the film (some haunting montage scenes at the beginning and end would have done the job well enough); they make me want to seek out James Vance Marshall's novel to see if they come off as intrusive there as they do in the film.Worth a rental, certainly, especially if you're a fan of Truffaut-style art-for-art's-sake filmmaking.

With very little dialogue and virtually nothing explained, it was a profound experience of shocking loss, disorientation in a deadly yet beautiful environment, and finding one's way back.  Accustomed to the pat formats of hollywood, I had never seen anything like it:  little resolution, reflection, or overt lessons.  Yet it stimulated a great dialogue with my father, who had insisted that I accompany him to it.  Though I had not seen it since 1972, its images stuck with me as if in a dream.Now, nearly 40 years later, I bought it for my daughter, to nurture her interest in anthropology.  I am happy to say that she was swept into it in the same way, wondering what it meant and wanting to learn more.  What better success could there be than that?The story begins with a normal city in AUstralia.  A father takes his children to the outback for a picnic, and without explanation completely loses it, leaving them to fend for themselves in a land so alien that they have no idea how to survive.  Trapped in an oasis that dries up without food, they are lucky to be found by a young aborigine, on his ""walkabout"" - a stay alone in the veldt to test his survival skills - and he brings them to a road.  Apparently, in helping them, he violates the conditions of his walkabout, with terrible consequences.As a visual poem, the film has many sequences of silence or trivial dialogue, a cover for deeper meanings that the viewer must seek out later.  The girl, Agutter, is shielding her brother from frightening realities, but it is the young brother who is the real focus of the story.  He has sudden flashes of insight, at times far more perceptive than his more conventional sister, though at his age he often must act them out rather than articulate them.  She keeps him going, but it is his mind and spirit that keep them together and then achieve some communication with the aborigine man child.  There is also a youthful sexual tension that appears shocking, like the innumerable brutal contrasts in the film.  The tragic outcome, after so much has been experienced, is the most shocking of all, and the most un-hollywood:  ironic, muted, and mysterious, as much a feeling as a story.  I have never seen a clash and meeting of cultures portrayed with such artistry.Recommended as one of the greatest film experiences I have known.  It is a classic.

On one level, it's a harrowing adventure of two abandoned kids in the Australian outback.  On another, it's a mystical meditation, a tone poem if you will, about the greater world just beyond our so-called modern civilization.  It's also a wonderful coming of age drama, a love story and an exploration of innocence lost -- and perhaps regained.  There's a mythic sensibility to this enterprise.  In places, images remind of a Garden of Eden story, but viewed through desperate adolescence.Beautiful Jenny Agutter was only 16 when production began.  Her little brother was director Roeg's six year-old son Luc.  David Gulpilil, an extraordinarily gifted aboriginal actor and dancer was barely 17.  This was his first film.  His astonishing presence haunts the film -- and the memory -- decades after it's premier.Beautifully photographed, this was cinematographer Roeg's directorial debut.

Simple and straightforward with no Hollywood pretense, I can even stomach the odd atmospheric scientist sequences as some kind of foil to the story.  Jenny Agutter does an excellent job as the naive Aussie girl trying to protect her brother and survive in a very hostile environment.  The young Aborigine is the perfect foil to her naivete.  I wish it had had at least some subtitles to understand his speech, but I felt his actions spoke beautifully for him.  The story is a bit contrived, but well adapted to the movie.  Some friends think it's a bit slow developing, but I found I liked it.  Yes, the nude Jenny is lovely to look at, but it is integral to the story, not just thrown in for the pervs.  The situations are appropriate to the storyline.  This transfer to BluRay isn't perfect, but I found it very good, and though the colors are slightly less bright than the original DVD, they still come through well enough.

25206,A2CVVCODXDVJO6,0780020847,Shirley Li,"[6, 9]","This 1971 film was a buzzmaker; not only was it a forerunner in the filming techniques, Walkabout was an audacious attempt during a time of great controversies (end of Vietnam War, nascent awareness of protecting  nature, etc) Bravely capturing some of the darknest sides of human nature  the so-called civiliazed world had refused to acknowledge before, Walkabout  is the story of 2 British/Australian children stranded in the Australian  outback, surving w/ the aids of a Aborigine teen who is coming in contact  w/ the world as well as his manliness (a ritual called walkabout).The  distinctive visual aspects of this film evolve around the tense collision  of progress and of nature against the backdrop of Australia's beautiful  outback. In the preview, the audience is forewarned of a showdown at a  place where man is just another creature competing for space and for food.  The director not only emphasizes the beauty of nature but also its  aggressive nature toward the weak, and of course its resistance to  progress.  The truly stunning way human nature is presented in the midst of  nature, however, is the best part of this film; each character is moved by  nature as his or her human instinct becomes bare in the wonder of the harsh  world where the rule is simple yet fair.Certainly a film not afraid to  showcase its differences, Walkabout manifests many controversial questions  to the viewing audience.  While dazzled by the simplistic beauty of the  Australian outback, the tensile harmony and the permanent symbiosis of the  wilderness further stress the aspect of civilization's root in nature, and  nature's influence on civilization.  As the audience follows the main  characters through trials of the most primordial kinds, I myself feel the  tension building up as modern men's nature fuses with the ancient law of  survivor.Personally I see no objection in trying to locate a point  where the ""caveman instinct"" co-dominates with the modern knowledge in  order for us to stay in focus on humanity's purpose.  Progress is not evil.  Some may blame technological advance as a main source of evil in the  modern world because many primordial instincts are now weak rivaling with  extrinsic, materialistic callings. As shown in several shots in which  modern people's action are shown to resemble Aborigine's, what Walkabout  concludes is that mankind never sheds the basic essence of our nature.",4,"Voila..you see the world, you see yourself.",948153600,"01 18, 2000",2000,2418,"['1971', 'film', 'was', 'buzzmaker', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'forerunner', 'filming', 'techniques', 'Walkabout', 'was', 'audacious', 'attempt', 'time', 'great', 'controversies', 'end', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'nascent', 'awareness', 'protecting', 'nature', 'etc', 'Bravely', 'capturing', 'darknest', 'sides', 'human', 'nature', 'so-called', 'civiliazed', 'world', 'had', 'refused', 'acknowledge', 'Walkabout', 'story', '2', 'British/Australian', 'children', 'stranded', 'Australian', 'outback', 'surving', 'aids', 'Aborigine', 'teen', 'who', 'coming', 'contact', 'world', 'as', 'well', 'manliness', 'ritual', 'called', 'walkabout', '.The', 'distinctive', 'visual', 'aspects', 'film', 'evolve', 'tense', 'collision', 'progress', 'nature', 'backdrop', 'Australia', 'beautiful', 'outback', 'preview', 'audience', 'forewarned', 'showdown', 'place', 'where', 'man', 'just', 'creature', 'competing', 'space', 'food', 'director', 'not', 'only', 'beauty', 'nature', 'also', 'aggressive', 'nature', 'weak', 'course', 'resistance', 'progress', 'truly', 'stunning', 'way', 'human', 'nature', 'presented', 'midst', 'nature', 'however', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'character', 'moved', 'nature', 'human', 'instinct', 'becomes', 'bare', 'wonder', 'harsh', 'world', 'where', 'rule', 'simple', 'yet', 'fair.Certainly', 'film', 'not', 'afraid', 'showcase', 'differences', 'Walkabout', 'many', 'controversial', 'questions', 'viewing', 'audience', 'dazzled', 'simplistic', 'beauty', 'Australian', 'outback', 'tensile', 'harmony', 'permanent', 'symbiosis', 'wilderness', 'further', 'stress', 'aspect', 'civilization', 'root', 'nature', 'nature', 'influence', 'civilization', 'audience', 'main', 'characters', 'trials', 'most', 'primordial', 'kinds', 'feel', 'tension', 'building', 'up', 'modern', 'men', 'nature', 'ancient', 'law', 'survivor.Personally', 'see', 'objection', 'trying', 'locate', 'point', 'where', 'caveman', 'instinct', 'co-dominates', 'modern', 'knowledge', 'order', 'stay', 'focus', 'humanity', 'purpose', 'Progress', 'not', 'evil', 'may', 'blame', 'technological', 'advance', 'main', 'source', 'evil', 'modern', 'world', 'many', 'primordial', 'instincts', 'are', 'now', 'weak', 'rivaling', 'extrinsic', 'materialistic', 'callings', 'shown', 'several', 'shots', 'modern', 'people', 'action', 'are', 'shown', 'resemble', 'Aborigine', 'what', 'Walkabout', 'mankind', 'never', 'basic', 'essence', 'nature']",N/A

25212,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,0780020847,trebe,"[3, 3]","Coming to Australia from England with a minimal script, and a key role uncast, director Nicholas Roeg probably wondered if his vision for Walkabout (1971) would be realized.  It's safe to say that the finished film, more than met his expectations.  On the surface, a tale of adventure and survival, the film also touches other levels.  Shot in the Australian outback over the course of four months, the film features some cinematography that captures the character and unique beauty of the land down under, and provides a glimpse of the native aboriginal lifestyle.The story begins without much preamble, as a father (John Meillon) loads his children, a teenage girl (Jenny Agutter), and her younger brother (Luc Roeg, the director's son, credited as Lucien John), into their black Volkswagen for a long trip into the outback for a picnic.  Arriving in the middle of nowhere, the father suddenly pulls out a revolver, and after firing a few shots in the direction of the kids, sets the car on fire, and fires a bullet into his head.Left alone, the girl and boy gather a few of their possessions, and instead of retracing the way they came, they wander off into the dry and desolate outback.  Before long the pair are seen climbing upwards reaching a great height at the top of some elevated slopes, where they have majestic far reaching views.  They manage to continue with little to eat or drink, and somehow descend to a much lower level with desert terrain.  Miraculously, they find an oasis with a pool of water and a fruit tree, and refresh themselves.  The pool dries up overnight, but the children's fortune changes, when an aboriginal boy (David Gulpilil) hunting lizards happens by.  With no better options, the children gladly tag along with the boy.After this transition point, the film then features the aboriginal boy's survival skills, and the actual hunting and killing of animals, such as a kangaroo, snakes, and lizards.  Later, there is more graphic violence, as buffalo and other animals are shown being gunned down by a hunter.  The time spent with the white children, is a step in the transition to adulthood for the aboriginal boy, which culminates with his dance seeking the girl's attentions and affections.  Sadly the gap between them is too large, leading to a mysterious and tragic event.  It is not shown exactly how, but the lost children do manage to return to civilization.Walkabout is a provocative film that raises questions that are not always answered.  It is more of an adventure fantasy, than a realistic tale of survival, because much of what happens just isn't very credible, and is even surreal at times.  Geographically few of the many settings seem to match up, as the children's journey has them scaling impossibly high hills and slopes (without so much as a skinned knee, or breaking a sweat), then apparently descending safely to the desert with the oasis.  With the aboriginal boy they reach an area lush with vegetation, and a river that the girl swims naked in, followed by more arid terrain, and then farmland.  While the many locations used in the film are cinematic and certainly utilized well, it is probably safe to say that are probably not within convenient walking distance of each other.  The physical condition of the brother and sister, is just too good, for children that have supposedly travelled so far.The marvelous completely natural performances of the three lead actors, plays a huge role in making the film very special.  Jenny Agutter (Logan's Run, An American Werewolf In London), on the verge of rising to become one of the finest British actresses of her time, gives a very believable performance as the schoolgirl put in a desperate situation.  As a child, six year old Luc Roeg gives a wonderful and charming performance in his only film appearance to date.  The bonding between the young  boy and the aboriginal teen is kind of overshadowed, but there is some striking imagery when these two are together.  Young Luc grew up to become a film producer of some note.  Nicholas Roeg struck pure cinematic gold, when he found David Gulpilil (credited as David Gumpilil), for the critical role as the aboriginal boy.  Without Gulpilil's performance, one wonders what kind of film Walkabout would have been.  The film captures Gulpilil's native skills as well as his innate charm, in a performance that would bring him international acclaim.  Despite difficulties, Gulpilil has continued with his acting career.  His post-Walkabout story is detailed in a documentary included as an extra feature.Another bonus is a commentary track featuring both Nicholas Roeg and Jenny Agutter.  Each was recorded separately, and the commentary cuts back and forth between them.  The image quality of the Blu-ray version is good, but like many films of this age, isn't great.  The sharpness and color saturation of the original source material, probably just wasn't the best.Walkabout has a strong visual style, characterized by striking images, the meaning of which at times is subject to interpretation.  The lack of dialog, contributes to the lack of clarity at times.  Walkabout examines how people change on a journey, it's a film not without flaws, but one that grows on you with repeated viewings.",4,a surrealistic journey across the Australian

25213,A39UKBJJXJ82FO,0780020847,Tristan,"[2, 3]","Nicholas Roeg's 'Walkabout' tells the story of two children, one a teenage schoolgirl (Jenny Agutter) and the other her little brother (Luc Roeg), who are put into a deeply disturbing and unexpected situation that changes both of their lives forever. They are part of an middle class nuclear family in Australia. One day they are picked up from school by their father who then proceeds to drive into the desert, presumably for a picnic as they have a sheet and food with them. Eventually the father stops the car and the children get out. The girl helps set up the food and the sheet for the picnic while the boy plays around with his toys. Suddenly, for no seemingly no reason at all, their father pulls out a gun and begins shooting at his two children before getting out of the car, setting it on fire, and then shooting himself in the head. The boy hides behind a large rock, but the girl witnesses the entire thing. She is scared and shocked, but in order to hide the horror of the situation from her brother she quickly tells him that their father said to go on ahead without them. So they walk in the opposite direction. They walk for a few days, slowly eating their food and water along the way until they run out. They begin to get really hungry and thirsty to the point where they can barely move at which point an aborigine boy finds them. The girl is unable to communicate with him, but the boy's simplistic gestures are understandable enough for the aborigine to understand. He helps them survive through hunting and living off the land and the three youngsters grow very close, despite the complete and utter lack of communication. It turns out that the aborigine is enduring a ""walkabout"", which, roughly according to the opening scroll of the film, is a rite of passage where an aborigine, who is not quite a man yet no longer a boy, must live in the wilderness for six months.Walkabout is impossible to forget. The film's imagery is ultimately very personal and so intimate and close in it's depiction of events that it is harrowing to watch. The opening scenes of the situation taking place that leaves the two main characters alone in the desert seems very cruel, even for a horror film. The atmosphere comes across as almost too realistic at times, which only helps elevate the tension of the picture. So yes, this is a very scary and disturbing film. However, once you get past that the film is also one of the most powerful, emotional, and challenging films all at once about the outback and about children and about society. The environment of the film may change, but we are left with the same feeling of dread and of intensity regardless of where the characters are. The scenes that take place in homes and in the city and basically everywhere else except the desert are just as intense and abrasive as the scenes in the desert. The juxtapositions that Roeg makes play a part, not only in the atmosphere of the film but also in the film's philosophy of nature vs man. We see flies buzzing around but the film quickly cuts to the boy's buzzing sounds as he plays with his airplane before taking out a squirt gun and going bang bang bang and putting it up to his mouth and shooting water into his throat, with the gun positioning looking like a suicidal attempt. Then of course we see the father shooting at his son and his daughter before shooting himself in the same way that the boy was shooting himself. It's disturbingly ironic sounding, I know, but the film is full of these sorts of images and comparison shots. There's a scene where the aborigine kills a wallaby before chopping it into pieces with his crude blade while the camera cuts to a man in a butcher shop cutting meat. Both animals are dead and both people are, to one degree or another, cutting the animal for the same reason. Survival. The only difference is in the setting and in the clothes. The symbolism in this film is constant and very memorable, and yet none of it proves distracting to the plot or the emotions. A viewer can choose to ignore the symbolism and just enjoy the story about these children getting lost and befriending an aborigine. The film would still be perfect if it had been left as just that, but instead Nicholas Roeg goes an extra mile and includes so many wonderful themes and images that only strengthens the realism of the film itself. It's a spectacular idea, and the film works wonderfully.Jenny Agutter performed in this film before she was ever in her most well known films such as 'Logan's Run', 'Equus', 'An American Werewolf in London', and 'Child's Play 2', but honestly I think her work here is the best she has ever done. She was only about nineteen or twenty when she acted in this film, and she really was born to play this role. Her presence comes off incredibly strong. She and Luc Roeg have to carry an entire film and both do tremendously. This has been the only film that Nicholas Roeg's son Luc Roeg has appeared in, but he has a lot of charisma which definitely helps make his scenes with the aborigine that more alive and genuine. Their chemistry is simply a sight to behold. The aborigine himself, David Gulpilil, is just as fantastic as everyone else here. His smile is contagious and he does a fantastic job in a role that requires pure emotion and bodily skill and no understandable dialogue. In fact, it's perhaps the best I have ever seen. What I find even more incredible about these performances is just the minimalism of it all. The dialogue, to my understanding, was mostly improvised. The film's naturalness flows beautifully, and these performances help lend themselves to the reality so that when the picture turns dark and scary we as the audience feels that. The film contains little dialogue. The actions speak all for themselves, and what I appreciated more about this artistic excursion is that the visuals as well as the sound both work in telling the story.There are scenes of actual animal killing in this film and the scenes are very bloody. These scenes are presented in two different ways. First, they are presented as part of the survival tactics of the aborigine. Second, they are portrayed in a gratuitous manner and for no reason. Both ways justify themselves. The first way only adds to the symbolism the film depicts and is representative of the element of survival. People who have to survive in the desert sometime need to kill animals in order to eat. The meat eating these characters do are presented in the same way as when they eat fruit. The act of eating always involves the taking of a life or lives, whether it be animal or plant. The film gets that. There's a scene where the boy eats some kind of fruit that birds are feasting upon in a tree and says that it tastes like meat. It isn't how he says it though, it's the way he says it. He says the fruit tastes like meat in a rather unflinching and thankless way. He personally doesn't care what the food tastes like just so long as he isn't starving. As for later on in the film where the animals are killed for no reason, we as the audience suddenly act as witness to the slaughtering. We do not like it. It is presented as cold and cruel as it always has been. It also plays a key role in the plot and the fate of the aborigine that helps lend itself to the emotion of the film and the plot in question. It's not pleasant to look at and we don't like it, and thus we understand the emotions of the characters on a much more personal level.The film was made with little to no real technical skill and was apparently mostly improvised. The aborigine people were apparently actual aborigines and the settings were all on location. The crew for this film had little to work with despite the budget, and yet they were all able to craft a film that is as epic and as large in scope as any old Hollywood blockbuster. This film works brilliantly, both as an independent film and as a film in itself. The film is a joy to just watch. You could turn the sound off and just watch what is going on and you'd understand it. However, you'd miss the sound that is a joy to the ears. The music in this film is incredibly chilling and haunting, but it's so beautiful and almost nostalgic sounding in the sense that it's almost comforting in a weird way. Nicholas Roeg takes the time to develop the characters and the setting so that the symbolism works more powerfully, but the audience doesn't have to look into the symbolism to enjoy the film.There is another Australian film that works in a similar way called 'Picnic at Hanging Rock'. Walkabout, however, is one of the greatest films of all time. It is horrifying, disturbing, emotional, beautiful, honest, entertaining, and ultimately just majestic. It is surreal and it is unusual, but it is also mesmerizing and moving. Walkabout works as a coming-of-age film, a psychological thriller, a documentary, a tragedy, and it's even an excellent childrens film. Whether or not you have interest in the subject matter is irrelevant. Seriously, this film is so freaking brilliant. I love this film. This is my favorite Nicholas Roeg film along with 'The Man Who Fell to Earth'. 'Walkabout' is a masterpiece and there will never be another film like it.",5,A horrifying and moving masterpiece,1264464000,"01 26, 2010",2010,9220,"['Nicholas', 'Roeg', ""'Walkabout"", 'story',

25214,AQP1VPK16SVWM,0780020847,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[1, 1]","Nicolas Roeg's second film (and his first as a solo director)""Walkabout"" a pair of children (Jenny Agutter and Luc Roeg)are forced to survive in the Australian outback when their clinically depressed father tries to murder them and, failing to do so, kills himself. The children encounter an Aborigine on Walkabout who ends up befriending them and helping them to survive.A well made drama ""Walkabout"" gives the young actress Jenny Agutter (""An American Werewolf in London"", ""Logan's Run"") a chance to shine as a middle class girl who suddenly finds herself in an alien landscape both beautiful and sinister. The coming-of-age story that results and resulting culture clash/similarities are fascinating to watch in Roeg's film and prefigures what we see in later films such as ""The Man Who Fell To Earth"" and even, to some degree, ""Don't Look Now"".The Criterion edition of the film looks quite nice. Colors are quite strong throughout with impressive looking clear blue skies and shots that don't suggest the are of the film. Detail is quite nice as well although keep in mind that the film is over 40 years old. The transfer has been redone for the Blu-ray from 35mm interpositive according to the notes in the booklet and director Roeg himself approved the transfer.Audio is an uncompressed mono track and sounds quite nice.The special features are quite nice; we get an essay by Paul Ryan, an insightful and trivia filled commentary track (recorded in 1996 for the laserdisc edition)done by director Roeg and actress Agutter.We also get video interviews with Agutter and her co-star Luc Roeg. We also get a documentary on actor David Gulpilil.

Ebert made such a big deal about the Criterion release that it stuck in my mind...wow...a little Australian film about an aborigine and 2 white brats made him gush!Since then , this movie has always been on my list of to-sees...I never heard too much about the film itself, just that it was on so many critics favorites lists and that it was not merely a film, but an experience...Well, I finally clicked the ""Proceed to Checkout"" button and went for it.And here is, in one line, my feelings on Walkabout after one viewing:~I cannot wait to go home tonight and watch it again and again to discover the secrets hidden in its layers~This is a movie that will be a pleasure to watch over and over...but also painful as it delivers a harsh look at the so-called civilized world that we live in...how it cripples us and restricts us and makes us miserable, non-communicative and helpless creatures.The emptiness of the Girl's eyes...very much like the eyes of the creatures in the outback.The Boy, in his innocence and joys, doomed to ultimately become Civilized Man...And the aborigine...able to see life only thru his aborigine eyes...unable to change...unable to comprehend...Nobody is primitive or reduced to the Noble Savage here..the characters are realistic...parallels are drawn between them and chasms separate them as well...Beautiful outback cinematography only underscores this exploration of the human heart and the cracks and crevices of the human psyche...Budding sexuality covers the film like a sheen...have trees ever seen so erotic and suggestive?On the technical side, this film has beautifully restored color, but could have been fine tuned a little more in the scratches and dust department.All in all, a keeper....and I am looking forward to many hours of re-viewing this...I want to unlock the secrets of this film...but can they be unlocked?  I can only attempt and see...",5,Impressions From an Initial Viewing,1013472000,"02 12, 2002",2002,2005,"['remember', 'first', 'hearing', 'film', 'Siskel', 'rest', 'peace', 'Ebert', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'DVD', 'Ebert', 'made', 'big', 'deal', 'Criterion', 'release', 'stuck', 'mind', 'wow', 'little', 'Australian', 'film', 'aborigine', '2', 'white', 'brats', 'made', 'gush', 'then', 'movie', 'always', 'been', 'list', 'to-sees', 'never', 'heard', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'just', 'was', 'so', 'many', 'critics', 'favorites', 'lists', 'was', 'not', 'merely', 'film', 'experience', 'Well', 'finally', 'clicked', 'Proceed', 'Checkout', 'button', 'went', 'it.And', 'here', 'one', 'line', 'feelings', 'one', 'viewing', '~I', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'go', 'home', 'tonight', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'discover', 'secrets', 'hidden', 'layers~This', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'also', 'painful', 'harsh', 'look', 'so-called', 'civilized', 'world', 'live', 'how', 'miserable', 'non-communicative', 'helpless', 'creatures.The', 'emptiness', 'Girl', 'eyes', 'very', 'much', 'eyes', 'creatures', 'outback.The', 'Boy', 'innocence', 'joys', 'doomed', 'ultimately', 'become', 'Civilized', 'Man', 'aborigine', 'able', 'see', 'life', 'only', 'thru', 'aborigine', 'eyes', 'unable', 'change', 'unable', 'comprehend', 'Nobody', 'primitive', 'reduced', 'Noble', 'Savage', 'here..the', 'characters', 'are', 'realistic', 'parallels', 'are', 'drawn', 'chasms', 'separate', 'as', 'well', 'Beautiful', 'outback', 'cinematography', 'only', 'exploration', 'human', 'heart', 'cracks', 'crevices', 'human', 'psyche', 'Budding', 'sexuality', 'film', 'sheen', 'have', 'trees', 'ever', 'seen', 'so', 'erotic', 'suggestive', 'technical', 'side', 'film', 'beautifully', 'restored', 'color', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'tuned', 'little', 'more', 'scratches', 'dust', 'department.All', 'keeper', '.and', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'many', 'hours', 're-viewing', 'want', 'unlock', 'secrets', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'unlocked', 'can', 'only', 'attempt', 'see']",N/A
