Two are animated, with ""The Stableboy's Christmas"" a live-action presentation. You might recognize the title character as the kid who played the son in another religious-themed Christmas special, ""The Best Christmas Pageant Ever."" Each one runs around 25 minutes.These are unashamedly Christian (clearly were made for a Christian audience although I'm not terribly sure when and where they would have aired...if they ever did air at all) and if that bugs you, move along. I found them to be refreshing and while not of the highest quality, just as good as most of the clunky Saturday-morning-style entertainment that came out of that era. They obviously were lovingly-made...somebody put a lot of time and effort into these even though they might not have had the best equipment or talent available.They did actually have some surprisingly big-named vocal talent: June Foray (legendary Looney Tunes voiceover artist), Charles Nelson Reilly and even Casey Kasem!In short, these are fair, not a must-have but interesting particularly if you're looking for a diversion from the watered-down politically-correct nonsense so prevalent in most of the entertainment out there today.",3,Requires a certain audience,1354579200,"12 4, 2012",2012,1326,"['did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'when', 'ordered', 'out', 'are', 'obscure', 'well-done', 'old', 'Lutheran', 'shorts', '1970s', 'Two', 'are', 'animated', 'Stableboy', 'Christmas', 'live-action', 'presentation', 'might', 'recognize', 'title', 'character', 'kid', 'who', 'played', 'son', 'religious-themed', 'Christmas', 'special', 'Best', 'Christmas', 'Pageant', 'Ever', 'one', '25', 'minutes.These', 'are', 'unashamedly', 'Christian', 'clearly', 'were', 'made', 'Christian', 'audience', ""'m"", 'not', 'terribly', 'sure', 'when', 'where', 'would', 'have', 'aired', 'ever', 'did', 'air', 'bugs', 'move', 'along', 'found', 'be', 'refreshing', 'not', 'highest', 'quality', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'most', 'clunky', 'Saturday-morning-style', 'entertainment', 'came', 'era', 'obviously', 'were', 'lovingly-made', 'somebody', 'put', 'lot', 'time', 'effort', 'even', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'best', 'equipment', 'talent', 'available.They', 'did', 'actually', 'have', 'surprisingly', 'big-named', 'vocal', 'talent', 'June', 'Foray', 'legendary', 'Looney', 'Tunes', 'artist', 'Charles', 'Nelson', 'Reilly', 'even', 'Casey', 'Kasem', 'short', 'are', 'fair', 'not', 'must-have', 'interesting', 'particularly', ""'re"", 'looking', 'diversion', 'watered-down', 'politically-correct', 'nonsense', 'so', 'prevalent', 'most', 'entertainment', 'there', 'today']",N/A
