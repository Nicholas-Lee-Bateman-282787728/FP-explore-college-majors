1614004,A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY,B00AMSQBUI,MacheteJason,"[7, 8]","This is a 4-disc DVD bare-bones release for Naked Guns fans (with Wrongfully Accused tossed in). The Naked Gun films are in widescreen; Wrongfully Accused is full-screen. Naked Gun is a hilarious comedy series starring Leslie Nielsen. O.J. Simpson is also great as Nordberg. The Naked Gun Trilogy DVD available separately is almost triple the price but offers little more except audio commentaries and some minor bonus supplements. The movies are also available on Blu-ray with average picture and audio quality with few bonus supplements. Fans looking for good value will want to own this 4-pack until a deluxe Blu-ray release with 6 hours of extras is provided for all the movies. The price is right for these 4 star films in a 3 star package as it has managed to hold its value. Wrongfully Accused is about Ryan Harrison (Leslie Nielsen) who is framed for murder and must prove himself innocent by finding a mysterious one-eyed, one-armed, one-legged man after escaping from a bus accident on the way to jail.",3,DVD Value Pack for Naked Gun Fans,1378512000,"09 7, 2013",2013,1012,"['4-disc', 'DVD', 'bare-bones', 'release', 'Naked', 'Guns', 'fans', 'Wrongfully', 'Accused', 'tossed', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'films', 'are', 'widescreen', 'Wrongfully', 'Accused', 'full-screen', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'series', 'starring', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'O.J', 'Simpson', 'also', 'great', 'Nordberg', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'Trilogy', 'DVD', 'available', 'separately', 'almost', 'triple', 'price', 'little', 'more', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'minor', 'bonus', 'supplements', 'movies', 'are', 'also', 'available', 'Blu-ray', 'average', 'picture', 'audio', 'quality', 'few', 'bonus', 'supplements', 'Fans', 'looking', 'good', 'value', 'will', 'want', 'own', '4-pack', 'deluxe', 'Blu-ray', 'release', '6', 'hours', 'extras', 'provided', 'movies', 'price', 'right', '4', 'star', 'films', '3', 'star', 'package', 'managed', 'hold', 'value', 'Wrongfully', 'Accused', 'Ryan', 'Harrison', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'who', 'framed', 'murder', 'must', 'prove', 'innocent', 'finding', 'mysterious', 'one-eyed', 'one-armed', 'one-legged', 'man', 'escaping', 'bus', 'accident', 'way', 'jail']","4 Film Favorites: Leslie Nielsen: (Naked Gun From The Files Of Police Squad, Naked Gun 2 & 1/2: The Smell Of Fear, Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult, Wrongfully Accused)"

1614006,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B00AMSQBUI,Micheal Hunt,"[2, 2]","Naked Gun, CLASSIC! Naked Gun 2 and 3, not as good, but still classic slap stick comedies written by the Zuckers/Abraham trio, the same guys who made Airplane/Flying High, Kentucky Fried Movie, Top Secret and not as a trio made Hot Shots, and Scary Movie 3 & 5, then 1 on 5 as writer, then one did Ghost, and then made fun of it himself in Naked Gun 2... but enough about them.I shouldn't have to tell you the plot to The Naked Gun. You should have seen it already, if you haven't, then see it, I am making you. You are missing out on one of the funniest movies of all time. Parts 2 and 3, they are still great, nothing beats the original, but none the less, they are worthy sequels and nothing to be snubbed at.However... when making a 4 pack of Leslie Neilson like this, I can't help but wonder why Wrongfully Accused was thrown into the mix? I'm not saying the parody version of ""The Fugitive"" (1993) is a bad movie, but wouldn't it make more sense to include ""Files from Police Squad"", or just simply ""Police Squad""? The show was what The Naked Gun movie was continued on from. The TV show ran for 6 episodes on 1982 before it was cancelled. It was not cancelled because it was bad, in-fact, it is just as funny as the movies, but it ran against Dallas or something, so it's ratings where low, because it was in a bad time slot and not enough people got to see it to enjoy it. 6 years later they made a movie out of it, and it's become the great movie we all love today... if you don't, *blows raspberry and farts in your general direction*More people need to be exposed to that great show. Then perhaps, even Spy Hard would have made more sense to put in than Wrongfully Accused. Spy Hard pretty much IS Naked Gun part 4. Only Frank Drebbin has become Dick Steele, Agent WD40... no Priscilla Presley as his love interest/wife Jane, but much like Don Adams in The Nude Bomb, it's a funny movie, but people just have a problem with Maxwell Smart having a different love interest after his wife 99 from the show. But you know what, if you can get past that, or imagine the new interests is 99, I mean Jane, then Spy Hard is not that bad of a movie, and would make more sense being in this pack than Wrongfully Accused. Then again, I may be wrongfully accusing Wrongfully Accused as being accused of being the wrongful movie to include here.Man I wish Mel Brooks had done a movie with Leslie and Don Adams. Would have been great to see Naked Gun 444 and a 4th forths. Don Adams as his chief, and Mel Brooks as maybe the villain?  Unfortunately none of that can happen now :( and the world has lost 2 great comedians who where the greatest at slap stick that never got the chance to be seen on screen together.R.I.P Leslie, and R.I.P Agent 86.",4,Almost perfect!,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,2743,"['Naked', 'Gun', 'CLASSIC', 'Naked', 'Gun', '2', '3', 'not', 'good', 'still', 'classic', 'slap', 'stick', 'comedies', 'written', 'Zuckers/Abraham', 'trio', 'same', 'guys', 'who', 'made', 'Airplane/Flying', 'High', 'Kentucky', 'Fried', 'Movie', 'Top', 'Secret', 'not', 'trio', 'made', 'Hot', 'Shots', 'Scary', 'Movie', '3', '5', 'then', '1', '5', 'writer', 'then', 'one', 'did', 'Ghost', 'then', 'made', 'fun', 'Naked', 'Gun', '2', 'enough', 'them.I', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'tell', 'plot', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'already', 'have', ""n't"", 'then', 'see', 'am', 'making', 'are', 'missing', 'out', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'time', 'Parts', '2', '3', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'nothing', 'original', 'none', 'less', 'are', 'worthy', 'sequels', 'nothing', 'be', 'snubbed', 'at.However', 'when', 'making', '4', 'pack', 'Leslie', 'Neilson', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'why', 'Wrongfully', 'Accused', 'was', 'thrown', 'mix', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'parody', 'version', 'Fugitive', '1993', 'bad', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'include', 'Files', 'Police', 'Squad', 'just', 'simply', 'Police', 'Squad', 'show', 'was', 'what', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'movie', 'was', 'continued', 'TV', 'show', 'ran', '6', 'episodes', '1982', 'was', 'cancelled', 'was', 'not', 'cancelled', 'was', 'bad', 'in-fact', 'just', 'as', 'funny', 'movies', 'ran', 'Dallas', 'something', 'ratings', 'where', 'low', 'was', 'bad', 'time', 'slot', 'not', 'enough', 'people', 'got', 'see', 'enjoy', '6', 'years', 'later', 'made', 'movie', 'become', 'great', 'movie', 'love', 'today', 'do', ""n't"", 'raspberry', 'farts', 'general', 'direction*More', 'people', 'need', 'be', 'exposed', 'great', 'show', 'Then', 'perhaps', 'even', 'Spy', 'Hard', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'put', 'Wrongfully', 'Accused', 'Spy', 'Hard', 'pretty', 'much', 'IS', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'part', '4', 'Only', 'Frank', 'Drebbin', 'become', 'Dick', 'Steele', 'Agent', 'WD40', 'Priscilla', 'Presley', 'love', 'interest/wife', 'Jane', 'much', 'Don', 'Adams', 'Nude', 'Bomb', 'funny', 'movie', 'people', 'just', 'have', 'problem', 'Maxwell', 'Smart', 'having', 'different', 'love', 'interest', 'wife', '99', 'show', 'know', 'what', 'can', 'get', 'past', 'imagine', 'new', 'interests', '99', 'mean', 'Jane', 'then', 'Spy', 'Hard', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'being', 'pack', 'Wrongfully', 'Accused', 'Then', 'again', 'may', 'be', 'wrongfully', 'accusing', 'Wrongfully', 'Accused', 'being', 'accused', 'being', 'wrongful', 'movie', 'include', 'here.Man', 'wish', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'had', 'done', 'movie', 'Leslie', 'Don', 'Adams', 'Would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'see', 'Naked', 'Gun', '444', '4th', 'forths', 'Don', 'Adams', 'chief', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'maybe', 'villain', 'Unfortunately', 'none', 'can', 'happen', 'now', 'world', 'lost', '2', 'great', 'comedians', 'who', 'where', 'greatest', 'slap', 'stick', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'be', 'seen', 'screen', 'together.R.I.P', 'Leslie', 'R.I.P', 'Agent', '86']","4 Film Favorites: Leslie Nielsen: (Naked Gun From The Files Of Police Squad, Naked Gun 2 & 1/2: The Smell Of Fear, Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult, Wrongfully Accused)"
