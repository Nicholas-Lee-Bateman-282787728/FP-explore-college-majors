That she contemplated quitting to become a more devoted mother; that she only sang a phrase or two first with Pavarotti and then with Domingo in this DVD showing that she has reached the top notch; that most contributors are no more than ordinary people in the street, or else her own loving mother; that she wasn't exactly a child prodigy with a perfect musical upbringing? What exactly is it, since both the sound and picture are so perfect?  That the singing appears in piecemeal and not glamorous enough, perhaps?  But there is an in depth portrayal of the rehearsing and performing of Desdemona in Othello!Sure there is nothing too intriquing here, but it's a very good, if not too great, DVD to watch. It gives us a full and realistic picture of this very good, if not too great, modern opera singer. It doesn't compare unfavouable with the video biographies of Solti or Oistrakh on DVD at all. Not being one of her fans and as such, without too much expectations, there isn't any disappointment as such. It does give me more or less the full worth of the price.",3,Nothing Too Intriquing Here .,1059350400,"07 28, 2003",2003,1132,"['What', 'exactly', 'Renee', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'DVD', 'contemplated', 'quitting', 'become', 'more', 'devoted', 'mother', 'only', 'sang', 'phrase', 'two', 'first', 'Pavarotti', 'then', 'Domingo', 'DVD', 'showing', 'reached', 'top', 'notch', 'most', 'contributors', 'are', 'more', 'ordinary', 'people', 'street', 'else', 'own', 'loving', 'mother', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'child', 'prodigy', 'perfect', 'musical', 'upbringing', 'What', 'exactly', 'sound', 'picture', 'are', 'so', 'perfect', 'singing', 'piecemeal', 'not', 'glamorous', 'enough', 'perhaps', 'depth', 'portrayal', 'rehearsing', 'performing', 'Desdemona', 'Othello', 'Sure', 'nothing', 'too', 'intriquing', 'here', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'too', 'great', 'DVD', 'watch', 'full', 'realistic', 'picture', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'too', 'great', 'modern', 'opera', 'singer', ""n't"", 'compare', 'unfavouable', 'video', 'biographies', 'Solti', 'Oistrakh', 'DVD', 'Not', 'being', 'one', 'fans', 'such', 'too', 'much', 'expectations', ""n't"", 'disappointment', 'such', 'give', 'more', 'less', 'full', 'worth', 'price']",Renee Fleming: A Film by Tony Palmer

So much beautiful footage and very ""artistically"" put together.  Some favorite moments include:--""Chi il bel sogno di Doretta"" live, where sings that high note unbelievably easy and on pitch--""You'll Never Walk Alone"" live, and in an AMAZING arrangement where she hits at least a high E flat!--Ren&eacute;e's mother describes when Ren&eacute;e sung at the Richard Tucker Gala and Mom begins to tear up because ""so was SOOO good!""--She sings ""Summertime"" for the Clintons--her being moved to tears while rehearsing for Otello--The entire ""Beim Schlafengehen"" from Strauss' Four Last SongsThere's footage you missed and the footage you didn't even know existed!  I also found touching all she said about worrying about how to balance her career with being a Mom.  She actually discusses how she seriously said to herself one day that's it's been fun but now it's time to settle down, find a nice teaching job, and be a Mom.  That was touching.And of course there's just lots and lots of live footage:  Desdemonda, Ellington standards, duets with Hvorostovsky, Domingo, Pavarotti, and more more more.  Plus, her in some REALLY REALLY ravishing dresses.  A little annoying were these clips of Ren&eacute;e lip-syncing some arias.  That was a little corney and boring.  And there was a lot of just uninteresting dialogue, even by Ms. Fleming!  Was it important to tell us that her mother was pregant with her when her mother graduated as the first woman from some obscure college?  It seemed like desperate small talk.  One thing I would have added to this film is narration or maybe some sort of timeline of her career.  And I think the DVD would have really been interesting if Fleming discussed some scandelous or not so great moments in her career, such as the criticism she has occasionally received about her singing or maybe some bad experiences in Europe like the whole Schwartzkopf ordeal.  I mean, the entire DVD can't just be happy friendly cartoon happy colors.  The good AND the bad will make a compelling and interesting film.It's all just good fun and I'm glad to have gotten my hands on this.

Renee Fleming has become an American treasure, America's great opera diva, but here you can see what a charming and down to earth person she is. Sweet with her children, always working on herself, she herself is her own worst critic.

This is a very so-so documentary with some interesting off-stage moments and interviews with the wonderful Renee Fleming. However, it's just too short coming in at 1 hr. Left me wanting more for both our magnificent diva and my money. Renee deserved a much better documentary and so did her fans.I wish Renee had discussed some of the more controversial moments in her career. It was fun to see her early childhood pictures (very cute) and the Muppets performance which had me cracking up. I question why the director followed this amusing clip with the heartbreaking performance of ""Amazing Grace"" at a Ground Zero tribute. It was lack of taste by Tony Palmer.Personally, I would have liked to see more archived rehearsal and stage performance footage. Renee's two daughters are adorable and make a few appearances.

720244,A2B58YQFYTX5E4,B00006LJAR,M,"[3, 3]","I was not familiar with Opera, never heard of Renee Fleming until I saw the Mormon Tabernacle Choir a couple Xmas's ago. Renee Fleming was the guest. She walked out and was a vision! gorgeous blonde with sparkling blue eyes. When she sang I was blown away and an instant fan! In following days I bought several items of hers, including this dvd.  I'm not sure what I expected, but this wasn't it. I watched once and it has been on the shelf gathering dust ever since. Thanks to my new surround sound home theater, I decided to watch all my music related dvd's again!! I'm glad I waited till now to review this. I liked this much better the second time. You can't just be a fan of opera though, you must really like Renee, and we see her warts and all.It's odd to see how uncomfortable she seems in her own skin, and doubtfull of her insanely perfect voice. Very little ""Biography"" type info, which was disappointing. Tony Palmer was trying to be too artsy as well. It opens with an old ""Muppets"" clip with Renee singing to them about counting, then immediate flash to Renee singing at the still smoldering 9-11 site. Then somber Ingmar Bergman type music as we see some pictures of Renee as a child. Then flash to what looks like a homeless man directing an orchestra while Renee, looking haggard with wild hair sings and spits. On second viewing though, I appreciated her really letting her guard down as they filmed all.Her version of ""Never walk Alone"" gives me the chills. I had the stereo SO loud and watched five times in a row. That brings us back to the artsy complaint....what's with the guys playing soccer during that stirring performance?? and why did Tony think we wanted to see them instead of Renee? I say if you are new to Opera, and are starting with one of it's big stars, don't buy this. If you really like Renee specifically and can get it for a good deal, get it and watch twice. Especially before reviewing. It's better the second time... AND buy Renee's Xmas with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir which was filmed for dvd!

At the time, backstage, I told her she would become the most important soprano in opera if she kept up her career path and believe she has, indeed, become that.  This film is exquisite and I loved it all!  The interview portion is important as it shows the angst that all working mothers feel; not just a beautiful opera star.  The clips of performances are just wonderful and showcase some of her best roles.  The bio is well done and I find no fault with any of the film.  If you aren't familiar with her singing, it is a must buy of how a truly soprano ARTIST should sound.  If you are, it is still a must in any collection of great singing.  I've seen her many times live and she always brings me to tears - this video did as well, even after several viewings.  Her sound is so beautiful tears are automatic if you have ears and a soul.  I've met this lovely lady and she can be proud of her accomplishments and this film.  I hope she realizes she can balance her career and the motherhood responsiblities she ponders.  She has too great a gift to keep it from the world.  The world needs all the beauty possible and she brings great beauty and healing to us all.  This DVD is highly recommended on many levels.  It does, however, leave you wanting more singing from that golden throat.  Thank goodness she has many CD's out as well.  See her live if you can; but buy this whether you can or can't!
