I saw this first on Showtime a few years back and was very impressed with it.  It showed Joe Bonnano the way that I truly belive he was.  He was they only mob leader to use violence as a last resort.  In no way do I condone using any type of criminal activity, (especially since I'm a retired cop, and Italian), but as far as entertainment goes, this is one of the better movies.",5,The Youngest Godfather,1178668800,"05 9, 2007",2007,416,"['thought', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'saw', 'first', 'Showtime', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'showed', 'Joe', 'Bonnano', 'way', 'truly', 'belive', 'was', 'was', 'only', 'mob', 'leader', 'use', 'violence', 'last', 'resort', 'way', 'do', 'condone', 'using', 'type', 'criminal', 'activity', 'especially', ""'m"", 'retired', 'cop', 'Italian', 'as', 'far', 'entertainment', 'one', 'better', 'movies']",Youngest Godfather

Well, he may have been fairly clean compared to most of the other Mafia chiefs, but he was still a gangster.It is still an enjoyable series, and it contains some interesting perspective on the role Lucky Luciano played in helping the Allies invade Sicily.",4,"Good action, dramatic, but a bit of a whitewash",1358640000,"01 20, 2013",2013,356,"['only', 'problem', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'gangster', 'Joe', 'Bonanno', 'look', 'hero', 'Well', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'fairly', 'clean', 'compared', 'most', 'other', 'Mafia', 'chiefs', 'was', 'still', 'gangster.It', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'series', 'interesting', 'perspective', 'role', 'Lucky', 'Luciano', 'played', 'helping', 'Allies', 'invade', 'Sicily']",Youngest Godfather

871680,A2FEQ88GI48HAZ,B0006OEXTE,"Willem De Blank ""the Dutchman""","[0, 0]",This is a movie based on the book A Man of Honor by Joseph Bonanno the once legendary mob boss of the Bonanno family. This movie is the childhood telling from Bonnano and the highlight of the book the Casellammarese war which was the war that caused the Mafia to form itself as it is now. Interesting but dry you keep asking the same question what are you hiding what aren't you telling in order not to incriminate yourself or your family.So the story is acceptable but not finished. I guess if you love Mafia movies this is worth investing in.,3,not as good as the godfather,1311292800,"07 22, 2011",2011,544,"['movie', 'based', 'book', 'A', 'Man', 'Honor', 'Joseph', 'Bonanno', 'once', 'legendary', 'mob', 'boss', 'Bonanno', 'family', 'movie', 'childhood', 'telling', 'Bonnano', 'highlight', 'book', 'Casellammarese', 'war', 'was', 'war', 'caused', 'Mafia', 'form', 'now', 'Interesting', 'dry', 'keep', 'asking', 'same', 'question', 'what', 'are', 'hiding', 'what', 'are', ""n't"", 'telling', 'order', 'not', 'incriminate', 'family.So', 'story', 'acceptable', 'not', 'finished', 'guess', 'love', 'Mafia', 'movies', 'worth', 'investing']",Youngest Godfather
