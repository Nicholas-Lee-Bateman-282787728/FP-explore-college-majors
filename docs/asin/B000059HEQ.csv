I like seeing the kids dancing and watching some of them grow up as we have several Wiggles DVD's, but I think the quality of the original video and the lack of creativity with the sets had my 16 month olds running in another direction from the TV when we played this one. I appreciate the Wiggles' growth and it is fun to see the boys so young and horribly styled. This was a video more for me as an adult than one that keeps my kids' attention (this IS definitely a children's video, but unless you started watching the Wiggles with this one, it will surprise you how far they have come.) If you want the meat and potatoes type of Wiggles that truly entertain the young ones, go for Yummy Yummy or Wiggle Time, even Taking Off.

He watches this one the most and doesn't want to fast-forward through any of the songs.

When you get right down to it, The Wiggles are all about the songs, and in that area, too, this tape comes up short--way short.Unlike my 22-month-old daughter, I needed relief from the monotony of the songs on our existing Wiggles videos, numerous as they were.  So, I picked up this one and ""Wiggly Play Time"" (another disappointment, but for another reason--it's just TV episodes).  Had I seen shaggy hair and non-Wiggle-ized shirts on the cover of this one, I'd have known I was buying older material.  But I didn't.  And in fact, I checked the copyright date and took it as an indication that it was relatively new.What a disappointment.  With a few exceptions, the songs here are un-catchy and performed without much zip.  Whereas my daughter will watch the newer tapes from start to finish, knowing that the next song is likely to be as good or better than the last one, that doesn't hold true for this one.  After two viewings (which took several starts and stops to accomplish, because she was so disinterested), she's taken to requesting the better songs on the video.  Not good.Honestly, I find the video oddly entertaining as a time capsule of what The Wiggles once were.  But that's not why I bought it.  I'll wait for VH1 to do a ""Behind The Music"" episode on The Wiggles for that.Don't repeat my mistake--save your money and buy one of the newer collections instead, particularly ""It's A Wiggly Wiggly World"" or ""Hoop-Dee-Doo!

I finally broke down and bought it since our baby watches The Wiggles EVERY night before bed, and nothing else will work to sooth her to sleep! I find this 1995 release to be very good, despite the bad reviews. The songs are well done and very catchy. I even ordered the CD! It is less polished then the others, but they use the same format of sing and dance and there are lots of children on this tape, which my 11 month old loves to see! Captain Feathersword is not with the Wiggles yet and is played by Anthony or his two brothers, and Dorothy the Dinosaur and Henry the Octopus both have awful costumes, but still you get the idea. It certainly is not the best Wiggles tape, but it is nice to see the boys so young and fresh. My baby claps her hands and bounces up and down to this tape just as she does to all of them. Wakeup Jeff, Wiggle Time and Toot Toot are the best though. It was upsetting that Lyric Studios deceived us in there packaging of this tape with 2001 on it and the new character costumes!

Of all the shows our boys could have gotten hooked on we are glad that this was the one.  Almost all of the Wiggle's songs can be enjoyed by people of any age and dancing along with my boys twice a day with the airings on Playhouse Disney serves as an excellent source of aerobic exercise.  We even listen to Wiggly CDs on every car ride over ten minutes and have not yet gotten to the point where we want to see how far the disks will sail like frisbees out a moving car window.  (A feeling I'm sure parents stuck with Barney fetishists know well.)We picked up this DVD before dropping the boys off at their Nana's house for a sleep over to make the seperation a bit easier for them.  Before we said our good-byes I made sure to start up the disk to serve as a little distraction.  Wifey and I actually had to stop and watch the first couple of songs, much to the chagrin of my mother-in-law.The production values are much, much lower than on any of the later disks.  The big red car that my little fellas love so much was a cardboard cut out carried by the fab four on to the stage,  Anthony's costume changes several times throughout and includes; a green mock turtle-neck, a green polo shirt and he even took a shot at playing Captain Feathersword. (Two of his brothers also took turns portraying the role that Paul Paddick has now made his and his alone.)Wifey and I finally left and were still talking about the disk an hour later on our way to dinner and a movie.  As near as we can figure, this must have been footage shot as a pilot or maybe even a pitch to a studio prior to the boys getting their own show.  Some one must have held on to it and now that The Wiggles have reached a high degree of stardom and recognition, instant cash for the studios.I'm not complaining, mind you.  The boys still bring this DVD over to one of us a couple of times a week to be played and they love the music and dances.  Wifey and I even still get a kick out of the hair and shoestring budget sets and effects.  Depending on your children though, you may want to think twice before picking up this particular Wiggley release.My guys are very easy going and understanding about change.  I have heard tell of kids out there who throw tantrums or (even worse) get sincerely upset and saddened by unexpected changes to things they love.  If yours fall into either of those categories pick up Yummy Yummy or Magical Adventure instead.",4,Early Wiggles for Completists only.,1080518400,"03 29, 2004",2004,2494,"['Wifey', 'are', 'proud', 'parents', 'twin', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'Wiggles', 'Fans', 'shows', 'boys', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'hooked', 'are', 'glad', 'was', 'one', 'Almost', 'Wiggle', 'songs', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'people', 'age', 'dancing', 'along', 'boys', 'twice', 'day', 'airings', 'Playhouse', 'Disney', 'excellent', 'source', 'aerobic', 'exercise', 'even', 'listen', 'Wiggly', 'CDs', 'car', 'ride', 'ten', 'minutes', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'gotten', 'point', 'where', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'disks', 'will', 'sail', 'frisbees', 'out', 'moving', 'car', 'window', 'feeling', ""'m"", 'sure', 'parents', 'stuck', 'Barney', 'fetishists', 'know', 'well', 'picked', 'up', 'DVD', 'dropping', 'boys', 'Nana', 'house', 'sleep', 'make', 'seperation', 'bit', 'easier', 'said', 'good-byes', 'made', 'sure', 'start', 'up', 'disk', 'serve', 'little', 'distraction', 'Wifey', 'actually', 'had', 'stop', 'watch', 'first', 'couple', 'songs', 'much', 'chagrin', 'mother-in-law.The', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'much', 'much', 'lower', 'later', 'disks', 'big', 'red', 'car', 'little', 'fellas', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'cardboard', 'cut', 'out', 'carried', 'fab', 'four', 'stage', 'Anthony', 'costume', 'several', 'times', 'green', 'mock', 'turtle-neck', 'green', 'polo', 'shirt', 'even', 'took', 'shot', 'playing', 'Captain', 'Feathersword', 'Two', 'brothers', 'also', 'took', 'turns', 'portraying', 'role', 'Paul', 'Paddick', 'now', 'made', 'alone', 'Wifey', 'finally', 'left', 'were', 'still', 'talking', 'disk', 'hour', 'later', 'way', 'dinner', 'movie', 'As', 'can', 'figure', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'footage', 'shot', 'pilot', 'maybe', 'even', 'pitch', 'studio', 'prior', 'boys', 'getting', 'own', 'show', 'one', 'must', 'have', 'held', 'now', 'Wiggles', 'have', 'reached', 'high', 'degree', 'stardom', 'recognition', 'instant', 'cash', 'studios.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'complaining', 'mind', 'boys', 'still', 'bring', 'DVD', 'one', 'couple', 'times', 'week', 'be', 'played', 'love', 'music', 'dances', 'Wifey', 'even', 'still', 'get', 'kick', 'hair', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'sets', 'effects', 'Depending', 'children', 'may', 'want', 'think', 'twice', 'before', 'picking', 'up', 'particular', 'Wiggley', 'release.My', 'guys', 'are', 'very', 'easy', 'going', 'understanding', 'change', 'have', 'heard', 'tell', 'kids', 'who', 'throw', 'tantrums', 'even', 'worse', 'get', 'sincerely', 'upset', 'saddened', 'unexpected', 'changes', 'things', 'love', 'yours', 'fall', 'categories', 'pick', 'up', 'Yummy', 'Yummy', 'Magical', 'Adventure', 'instead']",N/A
