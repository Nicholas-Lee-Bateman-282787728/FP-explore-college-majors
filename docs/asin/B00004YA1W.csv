We find out what happens to Kenshin and Tomoe as they are hiding from the government as a married couple.  But could there be a plot against Kenshin, and is Tomoe a part of that plot or is she being used?  Some exciting fight scenes, and beautiful animation makes this story more gripping.  The ending is very sad, so be prepared!  This is such a great, awesome series!!  There's some amazing visuals in here too!!  Like real footage of snow falling, water, fire and some real swords!!  It's really cool how they did that!  I think the English version is very good, the voice-acting is great too.  I've never seen the Japanese version, and probably never will since I don't know Japanese, so I still say that the English dub is good.  So don't let anyone discourage you from getting this because of ADV's adaption, it's still a remarkable and legendary series, no matter what language its in!!  And you'll enjoy watching this over and over again!!",5,Wow...,1056499200,"06 25, 2003",2003,984,"['2nd', 'part', 'OVA', 'superb', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Kenshin', 'Tomoe', 'are', 'hiding', 'government', 'married', 'couple', 'could', 'there', 'be', 'plot', 'Kenshin', 'Tomoe', 'part', 'plot', 'being', 'used', 'exciting', 'fight', 'scenes', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'story', 'more', 'gripping', 'ending', 'very', 'sad', 'so', 'be', 'prepared', 'such', 'great', 'awesome', 'series', 'amazing', 'visuals', 'here', 'too', 'real', 'footage', 'snow', 'falling', 'water', 'fire', 'real', 'swords', 'really', 'cool', 'how', 'did', 'think', 'English', 'version', 'very', 'good', 'voice-acting', 'great', 'too', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Japanese', 'version', 'probably', 'never', 'will', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Japanese', 'so', 'still', 'say', 'English', 'dub', 'good', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'anyone', 'discourage', 'getting', 'ADV', 'adaption', 'still', 'remarkable', 'legendary', 'series', 'matter', 'what', 'language', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'watching', 'over', 'over', 'again']",N/A

The story about a teenage Samurai assasin with a conscience interested me. After watching volumes One and Two I can safely say that it was 20 times better than I expected.The animation is superb, the story has interesting three dimensional characters and it is very well paced. The action scenes are simply outstanding! I must warn you about one thing: don't expect to see an hour full of sword-slashing mayhem, there are some truly incredible action sequences in this film but they don't overshadow the story. People do get chopped up in a very graphic manner but that is not the central point of the movie.I would recommend Samurai X to anyone who likes good movies, not just Anime fans.",5,"Excellent , Well Balanced Anime",980294400,"01 24, 2001",2001,781,"['bought', 'tape', 'reading', 'quot', 'Samurai', 'X', 'quot', 'couple', 'Anime', 'websites', 'story', 'teenage', 'Samurai', 'assasin', 'conscience', 'interested', 'watching', 'volumes', 'One', 'Two', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'was', '20', 'times', 'better', 'expected.The', 'animation', 'superb', 'story', 'interesting', 'three', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'very', 'well', 'paced', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'must', 'warn', 'one', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'hour', 'full', 'sword-slashing', 'mayhem', 'are', 'truly', 'incredible', 'action', 'sequences', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'overshadow', 'story', 'People', 'do', 'get', 'chopped', 'up', 'very', 'graphic', 'manner', 'not', 'central', 'point', 'movie.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'Samurai', 'X', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'movies', 'not', 'just', 'Anime', 'fans']",N/A
558833,AKFVX5CFY5E4J,B00004YA1W,"""nogana_naishi""","[2, 3]","I've had the displeasure of seeing volume 2, &quot;Betrayal,&quot; of the retitled Rurouni Kenshin Tsuioku Hen dub, &quot;Samurai X&quot; recently. What I found was very surprising, and very unlike ADV. For one, the voice talents were actually quite good. A step above any other dubbed release ADV has done. Another thing that was surprising for ADV was the rewritten script. Almost every line was somehow rewritten in the dub. Sometimes this just changed subtle things, but at other times this completely changed plot lines. i.e.: Kenshin proposing to Tomoe, which never happened originally. (I don't know what the geniuses at ADV were thinking when they rewrote that line.) Seeing the original episodes several times, listening to this new script was just a pain. ADVision always has had a knack for completely missing the point and rewriting lines when releasing OVA series based on TV series that it does not distribute. (coughcoughSlayerscoughcough)I recommend everyone reading to pick up the subtitled releases of this series, titled &quot;Rurouni Kenshin - Trust&quot; and &quot;Betrayal.&quot;",3,"Great series, awful dub",977097600,"12 18, 2000",2000,1101,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'displeasure', 'seeing', 'volume', '2', 'quot', 'Betrayal', 'quot', 'retitled', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'Tsuioku', 'Hen', 'dub', 'quot', 'Samurai', 'X', 'quot', 'recently', 'What', 'found', 'was', 'very', 'surprising', 'very', 'ADV', 'one', 'voice', 'talents', 'were', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'step', 'other', 'dubbed', 'release', 'ADV', 'done', 'thing', 'was', 'surprising', 'ADV', 'was', 'rewritten', 'script', 'line', 'was', 'somehow', 'rewritten', 'dub', 'Sometimes', 'just', 'changed', 'subtle', 'things', 'other', 'times', 'completely', 'changed', 'plot', 'lines', 'i.e', 'Kenshin', 'proposing', 'Tomoe', 'never', 'happened', 'originally', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'geniuses', 'ADV', 'were', 'thinking', 'when', 'rewrote', 'line', 'Seeing', 'original', 'episodes', 'several', 'times', 'listening', 'new', 'script', 'was', 'just', 'pain', 'ADVision', 'always', 'had', 'knack', 'completely', 'missing', 'point', 'rewriting', 'lines', 'when', 'releasing', 'OVA', 'series', 'based', 'TV', 'series', 'not', 'distribute', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'reading', 'pick', 'up', 'subtitled', 'releases', 'series', 'titled', 'quot', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'Trust', 'quot', 'quot', 'Betrayal.', 'quot']",N/A
558834,A37G6UPLDGH81P,B00004YA1W,"Ookami ""daronin""","[6, 9]","having seen this Movie previously in japanese,  I can honestly say it is one of my favorite films, if not my favorite.  The Japanese version, Known as the Rouruni Kenshin OVA, was a remarkable story Of an orphan, who became a slave, to be saved and trained by a master swordsman. Only to leave his master on a personal journy of misguided idealisim, which would turn him into a heartless killer.  After time, certain events occur that would lead him into becoming a different man, a odyssy of love, btrayal, and struggling too find what it means to fight for peace.  It was poetic, dramatic, and tragic.  With few jokes, alot of blood, death and heartache. It was a masterpiece of fluid enticing animation, well composed music, and a deeply moving story, well performed by the lead voice actors.Enter the American adaption of it.  Samurai X.  and once the movie starts, the subtitle.  ""Romantic tales of the Meiji.""  Continued with subtitles that at best, only carried half the meaning of the original dialouge.  and at times Re-wrote the scenes all together.  The english dub only got worse.  Historically inaccurate on many points,  (In the japanese language, the original story; okina was seito's superior officer, Both are based on actual people).  Written In on old, formal style of english, and performed by wretched voice actors, I was horrified at what was done to such a great OVA.The People at ADV Attempted to create a more mainstream, tragic romance, and unfortunately turned a great movie, into a cheesy one.  Think titanic with swords, and your on the right track.  This was not the Point of the original movie, and until someone attempts too release a DVD with the original story, I cannot recommend this title to anyone, except those capable of understanding japanese, and thus would have no need of the subtitles and english dub. Those that dont fall into this catagory, Would be fare warned to stay away.",2,"20 stars for the japanese version, 0.5 stars for the english",1041379200,"01 1, 2003",2003,1922,"['having', 'seen', 'Movie', 'previously', 'japanese', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'not', 'favorite', 'Japanese', 'version', 'Known', 'Rouruni', 'Kenshin', 'OVA', 'was', 'remarkable', 'story', 'orphan', 'who', 'became', 'slave', 'be', 'saved', 'trained', 'master', 'swordsman', 'Only', 'leave', 'master', 'personal', 'journy', 'misguided', 'idealisim', 'would', 'turn', 'heartless', 'killer', 'time', 'certain', 'events', 'occur', 'would', 'lead', 'becoming', 'different', 'man', 'odyssy', 'love', 'btrayal', 'struggling', 'too', 'find', 'what', 'fight', 'peace', 'was', 'poetic', 'dramatic', 'tragic', 'few', 'jokes', 'alot', 'blood', 'death', 'heartache', 'was', 'masterpiece', 'fluid', 'enticing', 'animation', 'well', 'composed', 'music', 'deeply', 'moving', 'story', 'well', 'performed', 'lead', 'voice', 'actors.Enter', 'American', 'adaption', 'Samurai', 'X.', 'once', 'movie', 'subtitle', 'Romantic', 'tales', 'Meiji', 'Continued', 'subtitles', 'best', 'only', 'carried', 'meaning', 'original', 'dialouge', 'times', 'Re-wrote', 'scenes', 'together', 'english', 'dub', 'only', 'got', 'worse', 'Historically', 'inaccurate', 'many', 'points', 'japanese', 'language', 'original', 'story', 'was', 'seito', 'superior', 'officer', 'are', 'based', 'actual', 'people', 'Written', 'old', 'formal', 'style', 'english', 'performed', 'wretched', 'voice', 'actors', 'was', 'horrified', 'what', 'was', 'done', 'such', 'great', 'OVA.The', 'People', 'ADV', 'Attempted', 'create', 'more', 'mainstream', 'tragic', 'romance', 'unfortunately', 'turned', 'great', 'movie', 'cheesy', 'one', 'Think', 'titanic', 'swords', 'right', 'track', 'was', 'not', 'Point', 'original', 'movie', 'someone', 'attempts', 'too', 'release', 'DVD', 'original', 'story', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'title', 'anyone', 'capable', 'understanding', 'japanese', 'thus', 'would', 'have', 'need', 'subtitles', 'english', 'dub', 'dont', 'fall', 'catagory', 'Would', 'be', 'fare', 'warned', 'stay', 'away']",N/A
558835,A13SMNS5QLSC9Y,B00004YA1W,Todd Rennells,"[0, 1]","Even slightly disappointing, with this video, is still head and shoulders above most anime.  There is absolutely no drop in quality from the first video.  There is a little less action in this tape (almost none in the first episode), but this is not bad at all; I was almost shaking with anticipation of when Kenshin would start killing again.  The character development is more important here, and it is well done.  So what didn't I like about this video?  It's almost impossible to say without giving away something.  All I can tell you is that at it didn't quite seem to completely bridge the gap between the first Samurai X and the Rouroni Kenshin TV series.Don't interpret this as a real negative, though.  As drawbacks go, leaving you wanting more is hardly the worst sin the creators could commit.  I heartily recommend this video to anyone who saw the first Samurai X or the TV series, and if you like anime and aren't familiar with Kenshin, I recommend all of them.",4,Slightly disappointing,974246400,"11 15, 2000",2000,974,"['Even', 'slightly', 'disappointing', 'video', 'still', 'head', 'shoulders', 'most', 'anime', 'absolutely', 'drop', 'quality', 'first', 'video', 'little', 'less', 'action', 'tape', 'almost', 'none', 'first', 'episode', 'not', 'bad', 'was', 'almost', 'shaking', 'anticipation', 'when', 'Kenshin', 'would', 'start', 'killing', 'again', 'character', 'development', 'more', 'important', 'here', 'well', 'done', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'video', 'almost', 'impossible', 'say', 'giving', 'away', 'something', 'can', 'tell', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'seem', 'completely', 'bridge', 'gap', 'first', 'Samurai', 'X', 'Rouroni', 'Kenshin', 'TV', 'series.Do', ""n't"", 'interpret', 'real', 'negative', 'though', 'drawbacks', 'go', 'leaving', 'wanting', 'more', 'hardly', 'worst', 'sin', 'creators', 'could', 'commit', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'video', 'anyone', 'who', 'saw', 'first', 'Samurai', 'X', 'TV', 'series', 'like', 'anime', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'Kenshin', 'recommend']",N/A
