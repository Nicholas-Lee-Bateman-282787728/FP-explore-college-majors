581617,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B00005BKZI,David Baldwin,"[2, 3]","To the credit of director Karel Reisz, ""Who'll Stop The Rain"" is a tough uncompromising film that takes an honest look at it's subject matter and doesn't back off.  The story concerns a journalist in Vietnam, John Coverse,(Michael Moriarty) who asks his merchant marine buddy, Ray Hicks,(Nick Nolte) to smuggle some heroin back to the States.  Hicks does so reluctantly only because Converse is his friend.  Once back in the States, Hicks is confronted with a narcotics agent(Anthony Zerbe) and his hired thugs(Ray Sharkey and Richard Masur) trying to hijack the drugs by terrorizing Coverse's wife, Marge(Tuesday Weld).  It is now Hicks' sworn duty to protect Marge and unload the stash.  The performances in this film by all the principals are uniformly excellent.  Though the film is tough going at times it only underlines a strong anti-drug message.  A previous reviewer took issue with the film's ending.  Not to give anything away, I disagree with that assessment though I've never read the film's source material, Robert Stone's ""Dog Soldiers"".

Naive and over-his-head,Converse enlists the help of his much more streetwise friend, merchant marine Ray Hicks, played brilliantly by Nick Nolte.The heroin makes it to Oakland and things go wrong as Converses unknowing wife (Tuesday Weld) and Hicks are pursued by a corrupt federal agent from an unnamed agency (FBI,CIA,DEA,BNDD??) and his two fumbling and amoral goons played greatly by vet actor Richard Masur and the late Ray Sharkey.Frustrated by the imeptness of Converse but protective of Converse neurotic and clueless wife, Hicks is forced to go on the road from the Bay Area to Los Angeles, trying to pick up some money from the heroin on the way.I can't think of any film that depicts the collapse of values of once good people that occured in the 70's via drugs and Viet Nam burnout. The idea that a reputable photog and sweet wife would consider selling the worst of drugs is horrible enough- that Weld and Moriarity can play these lost souls with believabilty makes the viewer think they are looking intohuman and spiritual tragedy. You may  find yourself rooting for Noltes Ray Hicks in this movie as he is the only one capable of taking charge in a chaotic situation, protecting the fragile wife of his befuddled friend, even at the same time protecting a misguided stake in the sale of an addictive and repulsive drug.Excellent cinematography and great soundtrack featuring Don McLean, Hank Snow and CCR.............",5,One the the Best Fims of the Decade,1209513600,"04 30, 2008",2008,1626,"['John', 'Converse', 'Michael', 'Moriarity', 'morally', 'beaten', 'combat', 'photographer', 'idea', 'bold', 'life-changing', 'move', 'smuggle', 'highly', 'profitable', 'quantity', 'heroin', 'back', 'States', 'Naive', 'over-his-head', 'Converse', 'help', 'much', 'more', 'streetwise', 'friend', 'merchant', 'marine', 'Ray', 'Hicks', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Nick', 'Nolte.The', 'heroin', 'Oakland', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'Converses', 'unknowing', 'wife', 'Tuesday', 'Weld', 'Hicks', 'are', 'pursued', 'corrupt', 'federal', 'agent', 'unnamed', 'agency', 'FBI', 'CIA', 'DEA', 'BNDD', 'two', 'fumbling', 'amoral', 'goons', 'played', 'greatly', 'vet', 'actor', 'Richard', 'Masur', 'late', 'Ray', 'Sharkey.Frustrated', 'imeptness', 'Converse', 'protective', 'Converse', 'neurotic', 'clueless', 'wife', 'Hicks', 'forced', 'go', 'road', 'Bay', 'Area', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'trying', 'pick', 'up', 'money', 'heroin', 'way.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'collapse', 'values', 'once', 'good', 'people', 'occured', '70', 'drugs', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'burnout', 'idea', 'reputable', 'photog', 'sweet', 'wife', 'would', 'consider', 'selling', 'worst', 'drugs', 'horrible', 'enough-', 'Weld', 'Moriarity', 'can', 'play', 'lost', 'souls', 'believabilty', 'viewer', 'think', 'are', 'looking', 'intohuman', 'spiritual', 'tragedy', 'may', 'find', 'rooting', 'Noltes', 'Ray', 'Hicks', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'capable', 'taking', 'charge', 'chaotic', 'situation', 'protecting', 'fragile', 'wife', 'befuddled', 'friend', 'even', 'same', 'time', 'protecting', 'misguided', 'stake', 'sale', 'addictive', 'repulsive', 'drug.Excellent', 'cinematography', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'featuring', 'Don', 'McLean', 'Hank', 'Snow', 'CCR']",N/A
581621,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00005BKZI,Linda Linguvic,"[9, 11]","This 1978 film is a fast paced action-packed adventure story.  It's not real and not supposed to be.  But it kept me intrigued for more than two hours.  And that's saying a lot.The film starts in Vietnam, where Nick Nolte is a merchant marine.  When his good buddy, Michael Moriarity, a disillusioned journalist, asks him to smuggle two kilos of heroin to California, Nolte reluctantly agrees.  Tuesday Weld is the journalist's wife and she's the one who's supposed to get the package.  But things go wrong and Nolte and Weld start playing a cat and mouse game with some bad guys who are supposed to be rogue cops.  Moriarity has his share of troubles too; he's abducted and painfully mistreated by the bad guys.  From there on the story is simple, but the action kept me so busy watching that it didn't really have to make sense.Nolte is cast as the lead, but it didn't challenge his acting abilities very much.  He's the righteous tough guy who's had a bad life and refuses to be stepped on.  There's a lot of scenes of him with his shirt off.  He looks good, but I couldn't help thinking that if this were filmed today, he'd have a lot more definition to his muscles.  Tuesday Weld is a druggie housewife and most of the time she's awfully sleepy.  Michael Moriarity, however, is supposed to be weak.  That's a harder role to play.  And he does it well.  There's a great soundtrack of seventies music which moves the action along, and some original special effects.  There's a lot of violence and hard drugs.  Also, as it was filmed in the 70s, the atmosphere of that time is captured perfectly.This is not a great film.  It's implausible, the story is weak, and the acting not exceptional.  And yet, I loved it.  And I can't quite understand why.  It's not for everyone of course.  But I do recommend it.",5,Not a great film.

581622,ABE8YHLYSM15G,B00005BKZI,Luke Killion,"[0, 0]","""Who'll Stop the Rain"" is definately one of those movies that could be called a lost classic. I thought I had heard of almost every Vietnam movie, but this one goes a long way to show the plight of that generation, and the tragedy of a people alienated by their government.  I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie; the biggest surprise for me was the authenticiy of the period, combined with a brave desire to expose the corruption that ruined so many lives in Vietnam, not only on the battlefield but the traumatized and bitter post combat periods that all those truly exposed to the horrors of that war experienced. The fact the movie was released in 1978 gave it a true to life feel; the Vietnam films made during the war or just after it (i.e. John Wayne's ""Green Berets"")are typically lacking in realism, and some of the lesser ones made in the 80's and 90's fail to fully recreate the climate of the times. This film was made with enough time after the war to give it perspective, and a short enough span to retain the spirit of the generation.The first thing about ""Who'll Stop the Rain"" is the fact that despite its marketing, it is essentially a post Vietnam film (though it takes place while the war is still going on), in the sense that the main characters are finished with their tour of combat duty in the Marines. Nick Nolte gives a great preformance as Ray Hicks; I can't think of a finer role he's played other than Col. Tall in ""The Thin Red Line"".  The two characters are in complete contrast, as Tall is a West Point lifer in WWII, while Hicks is a disillusioned Nam vet who has joined the war profiteering bandwagon , smuggling goods on his runs across the Pacifc in the Merchant Marine. His buddy from the Marines, John asks for a favor, as he hesitantly attempts to ""break into"" the heroin business. It tells the sorry tale of the Nam vets, caught betweeen the Peace movement (who often denounced their efforts of blood and sweat) and the government, who required ""authorization"" to get a piece of the Golden Triangle opium business. This movie makes a poweful statement about the corruption that pervaded the South Vietnamese government, and by extension their ""friends in Washington"", as John calls them.The strongest aspect of the movie is perhaps its writing, which was based on the novel ""Dog soldiers"" by Robert Stone. The screenplay is amazing depiction of the seedy underworld of hippy era California and the infmaous Nam era DEA.  The supporting cast is excellent, as the head DEA officer and his goons blur the line between enforcing the law and racketeering set up work. Tuesday Weld (who would go on to co-star in ""Theif"" with James Caan in 1981) gives a sympathetic portrait of an addict mixed up in a life and death drug trafficking snafu.",4,A film ahead of its time in Vietnam era drug deal gone bad,1339545600,"06 13, 2012",2012,2781,"['Who', ""'ll"", 'Stop', 'Rain', 'definately', 'one', 'movies', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'lost', 'classic', 'thought', 'had', 'heard', 'almost', 'Vietnam', 'movie', 'one', 'long', 'way', 'show', 'plight', 'generation', 'tragedy', 'people', 'alienated', 'government', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'was', 'authenticiy', 'period', 'combined', 'brave', 'desire', 'expose', 'corruption', 'ruined', 'so', 'many', 'lives', 'Vietnam', 'not', 'only', 'battlefield', 'traumatized', 'bitter', 'post', 'combat', 'periods', 'truly', 'exposed', 'horrors', 'war', 'experienced', 'fact', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '1978', 'gave', 'true', 'life', 'feel', 'Vietnam', 'films', 'made', 'war', 'just', 'i.e', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Green', 'Berets', 'are', 'typically', 'lacking', 'realism', 'lesser', 'ones', 'made', '80', '90', 'fail', 'fully', 'recreate', 'climate', 'times', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'enough', 'time', 'war', 'give', 'perspective', 'short', 'enough', 'span', 'retain', 'spirit', 'generation.The', 'first', 'thing', 'Who', ""'ll"", 'Stop', 'Rain', 'fact', 'marketing', 'essentially', 'post', 'Vietnam', 'film', 'place', 'war', 'still', 'going', 'sense', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'finished', 'tour', 'combat', 'duty', 'Marines', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'great', 'preformance', 'Ray', 'Hicks', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'finer', 'role', 'played', 'other', 'Col', 'Tall', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'complete', 'contrast', 'Tall', 'West', 'Point', 'lifer', 'WWII', 'Hicks', 'disillusioned', 'Nam', 'vet', 'who', 'joined', 'war', 'profiteering', 'bandwagon', 'smuggling', 'goods', 'runs', 'Pacifc', 'Merchant', 'Marine', 'buddy', 'Marines', 'John', 'favor', 'hesitantly', 'break', 'heroin', 'business', 'sorry', 'tale', 'Nam', 'vets', 'caught', 'Peace', 'movement', 'who', 'often', 'denounced', 'efforts', 'blood', 'sweat', 'government', 'who', 'required', 'authorization', 'get', 'piece', 'Golden', 'Triangle', 'opium', 'business', 'movie', 'poweful', 'statement', 'corruption', 'pervaded', 'South', 'Vietnamese', 'government', 'extension', 'friends', 'Washington', 'John', 'them.The', 'strongest', 'aspect', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'writing', 'was', 'based', 'novel', 'Dog', 'soldiers', 'Robert', 'Stone', 'screenplay', 'amazing', 'depiction', 'seedy', 'underworld', 'hippy', 'era', 'California', 'infmaous', 'Nam', 'era', 'DEA', 'supporting', 'cast', 'excellent', 'head', 'DEA', 'officer', 'goons', 'blur', 'line', 'enforcing', 'law', 'racketeering', 'set', 'up', 'work', 'Tuesday', 'Weld', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'co-star', 'Theif', 'James', 'Caan', '1981', 'sympathetic', 'portrait', 'addict', 'mixed', 'up', 'life', 'death', 'drug', 'trafficking', 'snafu']",N/A

While I thought the book developed the characters and made them a little more understandable, I thought that overall, the movie was better storytelling.First, Nick Nolte as Ray Hicks:  Nolte does an outstanding job of interpreting Stone's vision of a modern American Samurai on a journey into hell.  A former Marine with the discipline of a dedicated warrior, Hicks' motives and reasons for his own existence are mercenary in the extreme.  I can't imagine anyone other than Nick Nolte playng this part.Tueday Welde as Marge does not quite fit Stone's original version of the wayward schoolteacher who works as a ticket girl in the front of a seedy porno theater on the outskirts of San Francisco's tenderloin district.  Welde comes across as a little less buxon and whorelike.  In the book, Marge has few redeemable qualities and no spiritual values.  Even though her part isn't as coarse, Welde still gives a pretty good interpretation of the character.""Who'll Stop the Rain"" closely follows the novel it was based on, but the screenplay diverges in several places:  When converse contacts Hicks in Vietnam; When Hicks brings the packages to port in Oakland; When Hicks and Marge catch up to Eddie Peace; When Hicks and Marge reach the compound of Those Who Are.  The screenwriters also saw fit to drop a minor character, Dieter, whose role in the novel version was as Ray Hick's mentor.Fortunately, Stone also worked on the screenplay, so a lot of the great dialogue was still left in place with some minor alterations.  ""Who'll Stop the Rain"" moves faster, cuts to the chase, and is very lean storytelling. There's not a lot of superfluous stuff, just a sequence of events that brings each of the characters into a quagmire of his or her own making - very much like ""The Dog Soldiers"".Of course, both the movie and the novel are about a world going to hell over war and drugs.  Both the movie and the book make a case that even though heroin is dangerous and lethal (Hicks calls it ""the king of highs""), war is probably the ultimate drug.The film hints at it, but ""The Dog Soldiers"" is more explanative about the origins of Hicks through his recollections before he dies.  As he fades away, Hicks visualizes his past, which gives the reader an idea of how this character could have evolved into being.If you want to know what Stone had in mind when he created Ray Hicks, read ""The Dog Soldiers"".  If you want to see this vision enacted in a though-provoking, suspensful action movie, see ""Who'll Stop the Rain.""",5,Ray Hicks Lives!,1066780800,"10 22, 2003",2003,2783,"['Converse', 'say', 'place', 'where', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'What', 'bummer', 'gooks', 'have', 'confess', 'saw', 'movie', 'Who', ""'ll"", 'Stop', 'Rain', 'read', 'Robert', 'Stone', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'novel', 'screenplay', 'based', 'thought', 'book', 'developed', 'characters', 'made', 'little', 'more', 'understandable', 'thought', 'overall', 'movie', 'was', 'better', 'storytelling.First', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Ray', 'Hicks', 'Nolte', 'outstanding', 'job', 'interpreting', 'Stone', 'vision', 'modern', 'American', 'Samurai', 'journey', 'hell', 'former', 'Marine', 'discipline', 'dedicated', 'warrior', 'Hicks', 'motives', 'reasons', 'own', 'existence', 'are', 'mercenary', 'extreme', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'other', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'playng', 'part.Tueday', 'Welde', 'Marge', 'not', 'quite', 'fit', 'Stone', 'original', 'version', 'wayward', 'schoolteacher', 'who', 'ticket', 'girl', 'front', 'seedy', 'porno', 'theater', 'outskirts', 'San', 'Francisco', 'tenderloin', 'district', 'Welde', 'across', 'little', 'less', 'buxon', 'whorelike', 'book', 'Marge', 'few', 'redeemable', 'qualities', 'spiritual', 'values', 'Even', 'part', ""n't"", 'coarse', 'Welde', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'interpretation', 'character', 'Who', ""'ll"", 'Stop', 'Rain', 'closely', 'novel', 'was', 'based', 'screenplay', 'several', 'places', 'When', 'converse', 'contacts', 'Hicks', 'Vietnam', 'When', 'Hicks', 'packages', 'port', 'Oakland', 'When', 'Hicks', 'Marge', 'catch', 'up', 'Eddie', 'Peace', 'When', 'Hicks', 'Marge', 'reach', 'compound', 'Who', 'Are', 'screenwriters', 'also', 'saw', 'fit', 'drop', 'minor', 'character', 'Dieter', 'role', 'novel', 'version', 'was', 'Ray', 'Hick', 'mentor.Fortunately', 'Stone', 'also', 'worked', 'screenplay', 'lot', 'great', 'dialogue', 'was', 'still', 'left', 'place', 'minor', 'alterations', 'Who', ""'ll"", 'Stop', 'Rain', 'faster', 'cuts', 'chase', 'very', 'lean', 'storytelling', 'not', 'lot', 'superfluous', 'stuff', 'just', 'sequence', 'events', 'characters', 'quagmire', 'own', 'making', 'very', 'much', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', '.Of', 'course', 'movie', 'novel', 'are', 'world', 'going', 'hell', 'war', 'drugs', 'movie', 'book', 'make', 'case', 'even', 'heroin', 'dangerous', 'lethal', 'Hicks', 'king', 'highs', 'war', 'probably', 'ultimate', 'drug.The', 'film', 'hints', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'more', 'explanative', 'origins', 'Hicks', 'recollections', 'away', 'Hicks', 'past', 'reader', 'idea', 'how', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'evolved', 'being.If', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'Stone', 'had', 'mind', 'when', 'created', 'Ray', 'Hicks', 'read', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'want', 'see', 'vision', 'enacted', 'though-provoking', 'suspensful', 'action', 'movie', 'see', 'Who', ""'ll"", 'Stop', 'Rain']",N/A
