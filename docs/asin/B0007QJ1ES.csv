887320,A1NW29BQR0ODAF,B0007QJ1ES,A. Carmack,"[2, 4]","...it is something much greater,"" said Mikhail Gorbachev upon meeting Paul McCartney.  And this video is not only a concert video, it is something much greater.  It is a look into how the Beatles (not just Paul McCartney) had a widespread but underground following in the former Soviet Union, an underground following that captivated the minds and spirits of the Soviet youth and ultimately helped topple the totalitarian Soviet system.Yes, the images (camera shots) change at a frenetic pace (although they do slow down for the last four or five songs), but this is no normal concert.  This is the Beatles, in the person of Paul McCartney, in Red Square--where the body of Lenin is still on display, getting its normal, nightly scrub down with embalming fluid so it won't decay.What doesn't and will never decay is the music of the Beatles and of Paul McCartney.  The DVD contains two concerts; this review focuses on the Moscow one.  There are twenty songs brilliantly played to a rousing crowd, which included a surprise visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin 3/4 the way through.  Yes, the constantly switching camera shots can get annoying (for that reason only I give the DVD a 4 (1/2) and not a 5.The clips between each song alternately show the visit of Paul to Moscow/Petersburg and record remarks by Russian citizens, scholars and civic leaders.  This is a glimpse into the large underground and illegal following that the Beatles had among the Russian youth of the 60s and 70s and 80s, which was a much more profound ""youth of dissent"" then any found in the USA.  To the point that current Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov first heard ""Love Me Do"" at the age of 13 and was motivated to learn English.  In 1980 or so, he fulfilled his dream by legally buying every available Beatle album.The only one not so dreamy in this DVD is Russian President Vladimir Putin, of whom Paul says more than once he is really loved by the Russian people.  In a visit with Putin before the concert (this is all on the DVD) Putin is asked if he used to listen to the Beatles.  Putin replies yes and then says: ""the Beatles were a breath of fresh air.""  Bull crap.I mean, I doubt Putin every listened to the Beatles.  And he tells Paul that he won't be able to make the concert the next evening.  Well, he does suddenly show up, as inconspicuously as possible, just as Paul is singing ""Calico Skies,"" whose words are just as applicable to Putin's reign as to any Soviet dictator's:Long live all us crazy soldiers whoWere born under calico skiesMay we never be called to handleAll the weapons of war we despiseThe Beatles, this concert and Paul McCartney in Red Square: this does equal a breath of fresh air, or actually a tidal wave of western culture over communism.  Putin is not a breath of fresh air. He does not crack a grin when a live picture of him is flashed on the huge screen behind Paul and the band.Oh yes, the songs: there is nothing to add to the others who have reviewed this DVD: to hear such ""decadent western"" songs as ""Two of us,"" ""Live and let die,"" ""I saw her standing there,"" ""The things we do today,"" ""We can work it out,"" all played in the heart of Red Square, with a scaffolded St Basil's Cathedral in the back ground and twenty year young police trying hard to not sway to the music, with sights of the Kremlin, ""this is more than just a concert.""And the climatic ending with ""Back in the USSR,"" ""Hey Jude,"" Let it Be,"" ""I believe in yesterday,"" (which seems out of place and probably the only anemic song in the set) and a reprise of ""Back in the USSR""--as Paul says his dad would have thought him crazy if he had said to him as a youth that one day he would be playing in Red Square before a teaming audience with the former president of the USSR and current president of Russia in attendance... well, the Beatles, in the figure and music of Paul McCartney and band, finally brought Beatlemania to Russia forty years after they had to America.As an aside, I beat Paul to Red Square by three years, having spent two months in Moscow in 2000.  And like a couple of other reviewers the film brought back memories.  But this is  inconsequential to the main meaning of the DVD and the concert.  But had I been there in 2003, I would have loved to join the citizens of Russia, Ukraine, Georgia and God knows where, to hear and live a piece of music history, or rather, history itself.I agree with a sentiment expressed toward the end of the concert that a love for the same music can bring people of vastly different social and political background into solidarity with each other--if only their leaders will give them true freedom to do so.",4,"""I don't think this is just pop music...",1134777600,"12 17, 2005",2005,4664,"['something', 'much', 'greater', 'said', 'Mikhail', 'Gorbachev',

887321,AUW8TCRK9EDQ6,B0007QJ1ES,Andre LeBlanc,"[12, 14]","Paul McCartney and his band look and sound fabulous on stage during both the Moscow and St. Petersburg sets.  However, what puts a damper on this DVD are the constant interruptions between songs.  Each song is followed by up to 5 minutes of documentary footage, mostly related to the Beatles impact on the nation during communist rule.  They make it sound as though the Beatles were responsible for the fall of the Soviet Union.  Needless to say, it is a bit overdone.  This documentary footage should have been condensed and positioned on the DVD as an extra.  As is, it really deters from the concert's flow.  There are also way too many camera changes during the show.  Every few seconds the view changes from Paul to somebody in the audience, to the stadium from afar, etc.  This also gets a bit annoying.  And, as another reviewer noted, for some strange reason the songs are not played in order.  It's dark out for one song, daylight for the next, and back to dark again.But this disc does have some great music.  Just be sure to have your remote handy.  Fortunately, each track begins at the start of a song, so you can easily fast forward through documentary footage.",3,"Some Great Music, But Poor DVD Production",1119916800,"06 28, 2005",2005,1175,"['Paul', 'McCartney', 'band', 'look', 'sound', 'fabulous', 'stage', 'Moscow', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'sets', 'However', 'what', 'damper', 'DVD', 'are', 'constant', 'interruptions', 'songs', 'song', 'followed', '5', 'minutes', 'documentary', 'footage', 'mostly', 'related', 'Beatles', 'impact', 'nation', 'communist', 'rule', 'make', 'sound', 'Beatles', 'were', 'responsible', 'fall', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Needless', 'say', 'bit', 'overdone', 'documentary', 'footage', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'condensed', 'positioned', 'DVD', 'extra', 'really', 'concert', 'flow', 'are', 'also', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'camera', 'changes', 'show', 'Every', 'few', 'view', 'changes', 'Paul', 'somebody', 'audience', 'stadium', 'afar', 'etc', 'also', 'bit', 'annoying', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'strange', 'reason', 'songs', 'are', 'not', 'played', 'order', 'dark', 'one', 'song', 'daylight', 'next', 'back', 'dark', 'again.But', 'disc', 'have', 'great', 'music', 'Just', 'be', 'sure', 'have', 'remote', 'handy', 'Fortunately', 'track', 'start', 'song', 'can', 'easily', 'fast', 'forward', 'documentary', 'footage']",N/A
887322,A1534MBU6VJXYN,B0007QJ1ES,"Anthony Nasti ""Tony""","[4, 4]","When Paul McCartney goes on tour to connect with his beloved audience, it usually for more than just the average ""Oh, I have an album to promote, let me go on tour"".His 1989 tour was Paul's first time onstage in many years, and he used it to show he not only still had the energy and vigor he posssessed during his Beatles & Wings years, but he also still was able to create a deep, personal bond with his audience like few if any other artists can. This spawned the excellent double live album ""Tripping The Live Fantastic"" as well as the exciting concert movie ""Get Back"".His 2002 American tour was a chance for Paul to use the healing power of music to ease the seething sadness caused by the horrific attacks on September 11th. The cd and dvd ""Back In The U.S."" were released to commemorate this wonderful act of musical philanthropy.In 2005, Paul did something that had long been awaited since The Beatles first hit. Ever since The Cold War, The Beatles were a huge phenemenon in Russia. However, there Communist government considered their music alien propoganda, and their music was outlawed. Still, the Russian citizens got their hands on The Beatles' recordings any way they could, and they felt a great deal of inspiration from them, making them belive there was a free world beyond the Iron Curtain.Over 40 years later, Paul ventured to Moscow to perform a historic concert in Red Square to hundreds of thousands of devoted fans who had been waiting all their lives for this moment. The concert was filmed and was aired on A & E as ""Paul McCartney - Live In Red Square"".This is quite simply an excellent concert movie. Paul and his band are in top form. Paul clearly wanted to give the Russian fans a night they'd never forget, pouring his heart and soul as well as his boundless energy into old warhorses such as ""Band On The Run"", ""Live And Let Die"", ""Back In The U.S.S.R."", ""Hey Jude"" and ""Let It Be"", as well as performing rarely heard numbers such as ""Two Of Us"", ""I've Just Seen A Face"" and ""Let 'Em In"".Mixed in with the live performances are commentaries by scholars and fans on how The Beatles' music had such a connection with the Russians during the Cold War, and why they still remained so popular. These interviews manage to come off as insightful and entertaining rather than annoying and unneccessary, even when they occasionally cut off certain numbers.As an added bonus, we get another concert of Paul in St. Petersburg. This is once again an excellent, energetic and fun show that shows why Paul to this day remains quite possibly the most beloved man in the music world.The sound and picture quality are excellent, and the special features are a nice treat. ""Live In Red Square"" is an excellent dvd that belongs in everyone's collection.",5,An Incredibly Moving And Tremendously Entertaining Rockumentary.,1168646400,"01 13, 2007",2007,2767,"['When', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'tour', 'connect', 'beloved', 'audience', 'usually', 'more', 'just', 'average', 'Oh', 'have', 'album', 'promote', 'let', 'go', 'tour', '.His', '1989', 'tour', 'was', 'Paul', 'first', 'time', 'onstage', 'many', 'years', 'used', 'show', 'not', 'only', 'still', 'had', 'energy', 'vigor', 'posssessed', 'Beatles', 'Wings', 'years', 'also', 'still', 'was', 'able', 'create', 'deep', 'personal', 'bond', 'audience', 'few', 'other', 'artists', 'can', 'spawned', 'excellent', 'double', 'live', 'album', 'Tripping', 'Live', 'Fantastic', 'as', 'well', 'exciting', 'concert', 'movie', 'Get', 'Back', '.His', '2002', 'American', 'tour', 'was', 'chance', 'Paul', 'use', 'healing', 'power', 'music', 'ease', 'seething', 'sadness', 'caused', 'horrific', 'attacks', 'September', '11th', 'cd', 'dvd', 'Back', 'U.S.', 'were', 'released', 'commemorate', 'wonderful', 'act', 'musical', 'philanthropy.In', '2005', 'Paul', 'did', 'something', 'had', 'long', 'been', 'awaited', 'Beatles', 'first', 'hit', 'Ever', 'Cold', 'War', 'Beatles', 'were', 'huge', 'phenemenon', 'Russia', 'However', 'Communist', 'government', 'considered', 'music', 'alien', 'propoganda', 'music', 'was', 'outlawed', 'Still', 'Russian', 'citizens', 'got', 'hands', 'Beatles', 'recordings', 'way', 'could', 'felt', 'great', 'deal', 'inspiration', 'making', 'belive', 'was', 'free', 'world', 'Iron', 'Curtain.Over', '40', 'years', 'later', 'Paul', 'ventured', 'Moscow', 'perform', 'historic', 'concert', 'Red', 'Square', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'devoted', 'fans', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'waiting', 'lives', 'moment', 'concert', 'was', 'filmed', 'was', 'aired', 'A', 'E', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Live', 'Red', 'Square', '.This', 'quite', 'simply', 'excellent', 'concert', 'movie', 'Paul', 'band', 'are', 'top', 'form', 'Paul', 'clearly', 'wanted', 'give', 'Russian', 'fans', 'night', ""'d"", 'never', 'forget', 'pouring', 'heart', 'soul', 'as', 'well', 'boundless', 'energy', 'old', 'warhorses', 'such', 'Band', 'Run', 'Live', 'Let', 'Die', 'Back', 'U.S.S.R.', 'Hey', 'Jude', 'Let', 'Be', 'as', 'well', 'performing', 'rarely', 'heard', 'numbers', 'such', 'Two', 'Us', ""'ve"", 'Just', 'Seen', 'A', 'Face', 'Let', '.Mixed', 'live', 'performances', 'are', 'commentaries', 'scholars', 'fans', 'how', 'Beatles', 'music', 'had', 'connection', 'Russians', 'Cold', 'War', 'why', 'still', 'remained', 'so', 'popular', 'interviews', 'manage', 'come', 'off', 'insightful', 'entertaining', 'rather', 'annoying', 'unneccessary', 'even', 'when', 'occasionally', 'cut', 'off', 'certain', 'added', 'bonus', 'get', 'concert', 'Paul', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'once', 'again', 'excellent', 'energetic', 'fun', 'show', 'why', 'Paul', 'day', 'quite', 'possibly', 'most', 'beloved', 'man', 'music', 'world.The', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'are', 'excellent', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'nice', 'treat', 'Live', 'Red', 'Square', 'excellent', 'dvd', 'everyone', 'collection']",N/A

Sometimes it gets annoying, but you get used to it.- A few tracks are interrupted with commentaries from McCartney and/or movies from Russia in communism years. The song does not stop but sound volume decreases for a few seconds.

887328,A3NUA12GI8OFU1,B0007QJ1ES,Colin Klein,"[8, 10]","3 1/2 stars--at least this time more of the songs are complete and not talked over. I guess that's what the misleading "" Full-length bonus concert"" actually means--the songs are full-length--because the concert sure isn't. We are very lucky they are included at all, but does everyone in the McCartney camp suffer from attention deficit disorder? There is not a single concert shot that lasts longer than 2 seconds. I found myself looking out the window while listening because I just couldn't take the non-stop hyperactive cuts anymore.That's very sad. Another huge lost opportunity for McCartney also. This was fantastic material, great songs with great sound, beautifully historic locations, and ruined yet again by unwatchable video. He does that every time, so I'm not really surprised. But still it's unbelievable when basically everyone else seems to know how to make a decent concert video--or a masterpiece like Concert for George.Red Square is more worthy of the documentary story aspect than ""Back In The U.S."" was, and more enjoyable.

That's because the former is all music, a straight concert. The Red Square concert is really more of a ""documentary"" with interruptions all the time.The 45-minute St. Petersburg concert was held several years after McCartney did the Moscow deal.  When he visited Moscow, he then did some quick sight-seeing in St. Petersbur and  promised the people there he'd be back. He lived up to his word.....and it's a great (and not interrupted) concert.Anyway, in many respects, McCartney fans who purchased the 'Red Square"" DVD wanting to see a concert, will probably be happier off watching this bonus feature.The song list is as follows: Jet, Got To Get You Into My Life, Flaming Pie, Let Me Roll It, Drive My Car, Penny Lane, Get Back, Back In The USSR, I Got A Feeling, Sgt.

887330,A1EAFFJQ2NDHGC,B0007QJ1ES,Eric J. Anderson,"[21, 26]","Paul Mccartney is still a great live performer. He gives a rousing performance of mostly old Beatles tunes and a few Wings hits. I have no problem with the performance or the sound. If you close your eyes, it is a very good live album. But the whole point of a DVD is to be able to SEE the concert, and on this level it is going to be very unpleasant for a lot of people.Every bleeping second they switch cameras, the camera pans or zooms, or there is a boom shot where the camera tracks across or down. There is no doubt that a little camera movement can add interest to a concert film. And cutting to different cameras allows the audience to see views of the other players and different angles one might not ordinarily see. In this Red Square concert, these principles have been overdone time ten. Watching this video gave me a headache, literally. The eye cannot focus on anything, study anything, or really enjoy anything because the objects you are trying to view are always moving around on the screen, or are there so briefly (one or two seconds) that you barely get a chance to see them before the image is snatched away. If this sort of editing bothers you at all -- stay away from this DVD, because this is the worst example I have ever seen.I like McCartney and the Beatles. I'm not one of those snobs who looks down on McCartney's silly love songs and melodic compositions in comparison to the gutsier quality of some of Lennon's work. I own all but the early Beatles CDs, and most of McCartney's solo albums up through Tug of War. The man is a musical genius and a fantastic performer.But, I think the worshipfulness and praise heaped on him by the Russians in the documentary sections -- which are annoyingly and needlessly sandwiched between the Red Square performances -- is way over the top. To listen to these babblers, you'd think that the Beatles were the prime cause of the fall of the Soviet Union. And that McCartney personally tore down the Berlin Wall. For McCartney to have approved these segments proves that McCartney is all about polishing his own idol these days. It's nauseating.Regardless, people go to concerts because they want to be entertained, and McCartney did that for the lucky Russians in the audience in Red Square and also the bonus tunes from Saint Petersberg. On this DVD, the quick cut/pan/zoom editing impedes the enjoyment I might have had. That's inexcusable. I've seen other McCartney concert films that were not afflicted with this editing disease. I'm going to seek those out instead.",1,concert performance 4 stars; the editing may make you dizzy,1127952000,"09 29, 2005",2005,2536,"['Paul', 'Mccartney', 'still', 'great', 'live', 'performer', 'rousing', 'performance', 'mostly', 'old', 'Beatles', 'tunes', 'few', 'Wings', 'hits', 'have', 'problem', 'performance', 'sound', 'close', 'eyes', 'very', 'good', 'live', 'album', 'whole', 'point', 'DVD', 'be', 'able', 'SEE', 'concert', 'level', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'unpleasant', 'lot', 'people.Every', 'bleeping', 'second', 'switch', 'cameras', 'camera', 'zooms', 'boom', 'shot', 'where', 'camera', 'down', 'doubt', 'little', 'camera', 'movement', 'can', 'add', 'interest', 'concert', 'film', 'cutting', 'different', 'cameras', 'audience', 'see', 'views', 'other', 'players', 'different', 'angles', 'one', 'might', 'not', 'ordinarily', 'see', 'Red', 'Square', 'concert', 'principles', 'have', 'been', 'overdone', 'time', 'ten', 'Watching', 'video', 'gave', 'headache', 'literally', 'eye', 'can', 'not', 'focus', 'anything', 'study', 'anything', 'really', 'enjoy', 'anything', 'objects', 'are', 'trying', 'view', 'are', 'always', 'moving', 'around', 'screen', 'are', 'there', 'so', 'briefly', 'one', 'two', 'seconds', 'barely', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'image', 'snatched', 'away', 'sort', 'editing', 'bothers', 'stay', 'away', 'DVD', 'worst', 'example', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.I', 'McCartney', 'Beatles', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'snobs', 'who', 'looks', 'down', 'McCartney', 'silly', 'love', 'songs', 'melodic', 'compositions', 'comparison', 'gutsier', 'quality', 'Lennon', 'work', 'own', 'early', 'Beatles', 'CDs', 'most', 'McCartney', 'solo', 'albums', 'up', 'Tug', 'War', 'man', 'musical', 'genius', 'fantastic', 'performer.But', 'think', 'worshipfulness', 'praise', 'heaped', 'Russians', 'documentary', 'sections', 'are', 'annoyingly', 'needlessly', 'sandwiched', 'Red', 'Square', 'performances', 'way', 'top', 'listen', 'babblers', ""'d"", 'think', 'Beatles', 'were', 'prime', 'cause', 'fall', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'McCartney', 'personally', 'tore', 'down', 'Berlin', 'Wall', 'McCartney', 'have', 'approved', 'segments', 'McCartney', 'polishing', 'own', 'idol', 'days', 'nauseating.Regardless', 'people', 'go', 'concerts', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'McCartney', 'did', 'lucky', 'Russians', 'audience', 'Red', 'Square', 'also', 'bonus', 'tunes', 'Saint', 'Petersberg', 'DVD', 'quick', 'cut/pan/zoom', 'editing', 'impedes', 'enjoyment', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'inexcusable', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'McCartney', 'concert', 'films', 'were', 'not', 'afflicted', 'editing', 'disease', ""'m"", 'going', 'seek', 'instead']",N/A
887331,AS262SBK5DT0P,B0007QJ1ES,"G. Reid ""Gary Reid""","[42, 47]","I was a bit surprised at first when I realized there would be commentary between each song.  Having visited Russia (the U.S.S.R. then) in April, 1971 I understand how necessary the commentary is to impress upon the average viewer the importance this concert had for the Red Square audience, many who had grown up in the late 60's and early 70's and were looked upon at that time as the future of communism by the Soviet government.  There were also many young people in the audience, their ages appearing to range from 40 to 10The concert itself, the sound and picture quality are excellent.  Seeing it performed in Red Square brought back many memories of my own visit.  The prescence of the commentary between songs is extremely valid.When we were preparing to visit in '71 we were told that if we could afford it we should take rock records with us, especially Beatles as their music was banned in the U.S.S.R., to give to Russian students.  I presented the Beatles album I had taken to a student in Moscow.  His eyes lit up immediately as he grasped it, turned and ran towards his friends, holding it high and shouting, ""Beatles!  Beatles!""At a dinner with Russain students given for us in Moscow there was a Russian band performing.  They played several Beatles tunes, including Can't Buy Me Love.  When we were leaving St. Petersburg (called Leningrad then) we were fogged in for an hour, the majority of our group went to dinner but four of us stayed in the terminal playing chess and drinking Dark Eyes wine.  Whoever was in charge of the airport speaker system took a great gamble and played the White Album for us, side 1, of course.So the commentary is very essential and gives one a true sense of the impact of rock music, spearheaded by the Beatles, on the Soviet Union.  I feel that if the commentary had been a separate added feature few people would have watched it and missed out on the true significance of this concert.As a side note I also gave the Stones album Beggar's Banquet to a hotel maid in Czechoslovakia.  Once again the bulging eyes syndrome as she ran down the hallway yelling Rolling Stones over and over again.Paul's band is fabulous and all the songs are great.  The commentary clips are brief between each song, a little dose of reality and history interspersed with the fun.  I have to admit it choked me up at times too.  It goes a little deeper than just presenting a concert for the entertainment value alone.  This dvd shows how personal freedom can be communicated in a way that not even a strong, repressive government could suppress.  It also demonstrates that the Russians can party as well as anyone on this planet!",5,Concert and Commentary blend well,1128470400,"10 5, 2005",2005,2660,"['was', 'bit', 'surprised', 'first', 'when', 'realized', 'would', 'be', 'commentary', 'song', 'Having', 'visited', 'Russia', 'U.S.S.R.', 'then', 'April', '1971', 'understand', 'how', 'necessary', 'commentary', 'impress', 'average', 'viewer', 'importance', 'concert', 'had', 'Red', 'Square', 'audience', 'many', 'who', 'had', 'grown', 'up', 'late', '60', 'early', '70', 'were', 'looked', 'time', 'future', 'communism', 'Soviet', 'government', 'were', 'also', 'many', 'young', 'people', 'audience', 'ages', 'appearing', 'range', '40', '10The', 'concert', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'are', 'excellent', 'Seeing', 'performed', 'Red', 'Square', 'brought', 'back', 'many', 'memories', 'own', 'visit', 'prescence', 'commentary', 'songs', 'extremely', 'valid.When', 'were', 'preparing', 'visit', ""'71"", 'were', 'told', 'could', 'afford', 'should', 'take', 'rock', 'records', 'especially', 'Beatles', 'music', 'was', 'banned', 'U.S.S.R.', 'give', 'Russian', 'students', 'presented', 'Beatles', 'album', 'had', 'taken', 'student', 'Moscow', 'eyes', 'lit', 'up', 'immediately', 'grasped', 'turned', 'ran', 'towards', 'friends', 'holding', 'high', 'shouting', 'Beatles', 'Beatles', 'dinner', 'Russain', 'students', 'given', 'Moscow', 'was', 'Russian', 'band', 'performing', 'played', 'several', 'Beatles', 'tunes', 'including', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Buy', 'Me', 'Love', 'When', 'were', 'leaving', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'called', 'Leningrad', 'then', 'were', 'fogged', 'hour', 'majority', 'group', 'went', 'dinner', 'four', 'stayed', 'terminal', 'playing', 'chess', 'drinking', 'Dark', 'Eyes', 'wine', 'was', 'charge', 'airport', 'speaker', 'system', 'took', 'great', 'gamble', 'played', 'White', 'Album', 'side', '1', 'course.So', 'commentary', 'very', 'essential', 'one', 'true', 'sense', 'impact', 'rock', 'music', 'spearheaded', 'Beatles', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'feel', 'commentary', 'had', 'been', 'separate', 'added', 'feature', 'few', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'watched', 'missed', 'out', 'true', 'significance', 'concert.As', 'side', 'note', 'also', 'gave', 'Stones', 'album', 'Beggar', 'Banquet', 'hotel', 'maid', 'Czechoslovakia', 'Once', 'again', 'bulging', 'eyes', 'syndrome', 'ran', 'down', 'hallway', 'yelling', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'again.Paul', 'band', 'fabulous', 'songs', 'are', 'great', 'commentary', 'clips', 'are', 'brief', 'song', 'little', 'dose', 'reality', 'history', 'interspersed', 'fun', 'have', 'admit', 'choked', 'up', 'times', 'too', 'little', 'deeper', 'just', 'presenting', 'concert', 'entertainment', 'value', 'alone', 'dvd', 'how', 'personal', 'freedom', 'can', 'be', 'communicated', 'way', 'not', 'even', 'strong', 'repressive', 'government', 'could', 'suppress', 'also', 'Russians', 'can', 'party', 'as', 'well', 'anyone', 'planet']",N/A

What a relief! I didn't understand the language then, it was pure escapism. Today I am fluent in English and I think these songs are mostly tongue-in-cheek and sometimes even corny. The Beatles represented the suburban tastes, not the avant-garde. Be that as it may, this music is pleasant, tuneful, and kind of liberating.The DVD, recorded in 2003 is half-music video and half-documentary. I liked the documentary part: e.g. one couldn't miss how touched Paul McCartney was during his visit to a Russian orphanage. I didn't like the music video itself - very ""jerky"" editing, though it does have some stunning images of the St. Basil Cathedral and the Kremlin.The in-between documentary is excellent and could pass for a decent introduction to a history of the Soviet Rock-n-Roll underground. In this DVD each song is interspersed with interviews regarding the Beatles by the aging doyens of the Soviet Rock-n-Roll scene. They share memories and praise the Beatles. They praise it too much. It is not the Beatles who represented resistance to the Soviet System, but the Russian underground Rock-n-Roll movement itself. What the movement did was to replace the ossified, wooden language of the party Nomenklatura and the official ""culture"". It found right metaphors for the young generation. It expedited collapse of the Soviet system, which was linguistically-challenged and crickety-old. The Beatles was a nice escape, it is still is. But I am against groveling and kowtowing to the Western culture, like some of the Russian characters in this video. The Russians have a pretty strong culture of their own.

887341,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,B0007QJ1ES,L.A. Scene,"[7, 7]","There certainly is no shortage of live material available from Paul McCartney.  Anyone who has listened to McCartney's live performances in recent years have usually not been disappointed.  In 2003, McCartney took his act to Moscow to play a live concert in Red Square.  The performance of former member of the Beatles in Red Square is considered an amazing feat, because as recently as two decades ago, this wouldn't have even been a thought.  The former Soviet government had banned the Beatles because they were considered to be representative of what was wrong with Western Culture.  However the Beatles had still managed to build up a major ""underground"" during the time they were banned.  This DVD, ""Paul McCartney - In Red Square"" chronicles both the concert and McCartney's reflections of Russia.  The DVD collection consists of McCartney's concert and visit to Moscow.  It also includes part of the concert that McCartney would deliver in St. Petersburg, Russia on a subsequent trip to Russia.  The only disappointment with the material lies that the concert experience is a bit incomplete.The real issue lies with the way the Red Square material is laid out.  There are twenty tracks that show performances of the material from Red Square.  As discussed later in this review, the material is top-notch.  Woven between the material is some of the documentary information about trip to Russia,  I don't have an issue with the documentary material.  However the songs from the Red Square concert were rearranged to fit the ""story"" of the documentary.  When I purchase a concert DVD, I usually prefer the concert material to be from a single night, complete (no edits, no omissions), and in order of performance.  These concepts allow for a complete feel for the concert.  Unfortunately by mixing up the performance, this does take away from the effect.  I also think that some of the performances were not shown.  I think it would have been a blast if we saw the whole Red Square performance from start to finish in its entirety - even if the documentary material was woven in.  It is worth noting that the St. Petersburg material has its ""documentary"" piece at the beginning - and appears to follow more of a chronological ordering.  However, the St. Petersburg material is definitely a subset of that performance.Here are ten things to look for:1-When combining the Red Square and St. Petersburg performances, there is no overlap.  The only song that is repeated in both segments is ""Back in the USSR"" - and this is for obvious reasons.  There are twenty tracks from Red Square and ten tracks from the St. Petersburg.2-Both concerts are going to give you a great feel for the talent of McCartney's band.  No doubt the highlight of the band is Abe Laboriel Jr. - who has to be considered one of the greatest drummers in the world.  His drumming is ferocious throughout both performances.  On the St. Petersburg performance, Laboriel delivers an incredible drum solo on ""The End"".3-While I feel the Red Square performance would have been better served by having the full-concert in its entirety, the individual content is still incredible.  You will definitely get a feeling for the passion the Russian people have for Paul McCartney and the Beatles.  All in all, the crowds in Red Square and St. Petersburg were lively ones and clearly help to enhance the whole live experience.4-I actually feel the start of the Red Square material was a bit ""slow"" on the first five tracks (with the exception of ""Band on the Run"").  From Track 6 on - I wasn't disappointed..  Keep in mind this doesn't translate to a slow start to the concert as the material is mixed up. The abbreviated version of ""Getting Better"" should have been done in its entirety.5-The documentary material is very interesting.  There are comments by former President Mikhail Gorbachev on his feelings on the positive influence of the Beatles music on the youth.  Perhaps one of the most interesting points is when current President Vladimir Putin admits that he used to listen to Beatles records during the period in which they were banned.  We also hear similar comments from the Russian Defense Minister who also used to listen to Beatles records.6-McCartney himself provides much of the commentary during the ""documentary"" portions of the Red Square material.  I found this documentary material to be the strongest.  I would have also have liked to hear some commentary by the band members though.7-The scene during ""Calico Skies"" when Vladimir Putin makes a surprise appearance at the concert has got to be considered one of the great moments in concert history during the Rock era.8-While there is a lot made of the emotion of performing ""Back in the USSR"" in Russia (and it lives up to expectations), there are plenty of other ""Hall of Fame"" performances.  Namely from Red Square: ""Band on the Run"" ""Fool on the Hill"", ""Calico Skies"", ""Live and Let Die"", ""Maybe I'm Amazed"", and ""Hey Jude"".  From St. Petersburg: ""Drive My Car"", ""Helter Skelter"", ""Let Me Roll It"", and ""Jet"" really stand out.9-In recent years, McCartney's performances of ""Hey Jude"" have been incredible.  In particular, it is the way McCartney gets the audience to participate.  The scene of this occurring  in Red Square is breathtaking and might be the strongest of all the Hey Jude performances.  Watch as one of the men who flank Vladimir Putin is heavily into the concert and sings along.  McCartney even calls out ""Mr Putin"" by name during the song.10-There are two good ""extras""- 1) ""Memories from Red Square"" - more reflections by McCartney on the performances; 2) ""Russia and the Beatles: A Brief Journey"" - a short feature that parallels  the Beatles and Russian history.Overall, if the Red Square concert was shown in its entirety, this would be a grand slam homerun.  However this is still a very solid DVD - highly recommended.",4,"Outstanding, but rearranged the order of the Red Square Concert Hurts",1183420800,"07 3, 2007",2007,5883,"['certainly', 'shortage',

And the answer would probably be, ""Well, not quite so.."" But it's pretty sure that they could have help, as they did help lots of people thru their art and joy. Of course, tearing down communism was a task so much difficult, so let's say that what they generated in the people behind the iron curtain of those years, was to help them to be stronger and make them believe that everything was possible. One could tear down barriers. The Beatles did that all the time.As for the music in this dvd, as usual, Paul delivers some magic shows, and leaves a message, which for some people is superficial: he does not break hotel rooms, or get drunk in the middle of a concert: he's just a NORMAL human being (but too famous, yeah!) but a musical genius: the dvd show that in great form.And for the extras, you agree or not with the contents, are great, very interesting.

This DVD was billed as a concert film but was really more of an A&E rockumentary about McCartney's tour of the former Soviet Union and what it meant not only for him but also for the people of Russia.

I would have even been happy had they made a DVD edit that allowed one to watch just the concerts without the editorializing.  Overall, this is a pretty good rock documentary but not a very good concert film.  I love Paul McCartney's music, too, but to give this DVD a 5-star rating it tells me that the people watching were not watching with a critical eye.  McCartney's music will always be a 5-star in my book but this DVD doesn't do it justice.

They all have their strengths, but this one edges them out through the sheer joy of the band's performance and the reactions of the audience. I've never been a fan of films like Neil Young'sWeld [VHS], where the audience gets equal time on screen with the performer. But this show was different...in Russia, they didn't get to see The Beatles...or Paul as a solo act...until May 24, 2003. This was history, but more than that, this was Paul McCartney delivering two rock-solid concerts (Red Square and the bonus St. Petersburg show).This may be the best band Paul's assembled (Paul ""Wix"" Wickens, Rusty Anderson, Abe Laboriel Jr., and Brian Ray). He could just hang back and float along with the ballads, but what is so enjoyable about this DVD is that he clearly enjoys putting the pedal to the metal on the rockers, too. Drummer Abe Laboriel Jr. is pretty amazing to watch...on the Beatles tracks, he remains reasonably faithful to Ringo's original performances. On the St. Petersburg take of ""Helter Skelter,"" the video bounces back and forth between jump cuts of the performers and the split screen behind them, and Abe is doing the Keith Moon / John Bonham thing with glee. At the end of the track, he literally jumps up off his drum stool, sticks in the air and a big grin on his face.

That comes through in spades on this disc which is both a great concert film and a rather touching documentary on a number of social and political notions.It isn't meant to be heavy going, and because of that, when you see the footage of the kids in the orphanage (the raison d'etre for the concert appearance), when you hear former Soviet military ministers saying they learned English from Beatles records, when you see even Putin crack the KGB veneer to acknowledge that something about the message of love that 4 guys from Liverpool stood for warmed even the iciest of hearts. McCartney seems to know that there was something in the Russian psyche that needed respect from his as well and he is also the consummate diplomat and a generous and genuine musical ambassador. After touring the Hermitage with Putin, he acknowledges how touched he is that the kids in the orphanage who perform for him are dressed in their Sunday best. That's a sensibility that only a working class kid would understand and recognize as important. He also gets quite a giggle out of the Russian police chasing him out of Red Square on his bicycle (it's a no-no), not caring who the heck he is. The laugh is on Mac and he enjoys it, sheepishly.As for the Concert in Red Square and in St Petersburg, the shows are incredible. A number of talking heads relate their tales of securing Beatles records as they grew up, and it's rather touching. You get the picture that they got the message far more profoundly than those in the west. So as the band hits the stage, the rush in the crowd is exhilarating. Even Putin gets rockin during ""Back in the USSR"", and his KGB body guards are having a ball.McCartney's observations during ""Fool On A Hill"" clearly indicate he knows and understands what this music means to people and he is determined to give them a great show and have fun. And he succeeds brilliantly. During ""Let it Be"" and ""Hey Jude"" the crowd is at times on the verge of tears, particularly one old fella. The robust singing along during ""Jude"" could only have happened in Russia where there is such enormous pride in polyphonic singing. Macca is stunned by how strongly the crowd joins in.The experience was joyful and humbling. Having met Gorbachev, Putin and so many of the people of Russia, McCartney reflects on what it would be like to be able to tell his parents about this trip. It's the voice of a son who was raised to do the right thing and who wants his parents to know he upheld the family name. There is something about that that cuts across all nationalities and ethnicities. He's the genuine article, and this is a film with great music and a profound message.",5,Two great concerts and an incredible message,1119225600,"06 20, 2005",2005,2810,"['One', 'great', 'things', 'Macca', 'never', 'forgotten', 'where', 'came', 'inspite', 'wealth', 'success', 'what', 'important', 'through', 'spades', 'disc', 'great', 'concert', 'film', 'rather', 'touching', 'documentary', 'number', 'social', 'political', 'notions.It', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'heavy', 'going', 'when', 'see', 'footage', 'kids', 'orphanage', 'raison', ""d'etre"", 'concert', 'appearance', 'when', 'hear', 'former', 'Soviet', 'military', 'ministers', 'saying', 'learned', 'English', 'Beatles', 'records', 'when', 'see', 'even', 'Putin', 'crack', 'KGB', 'veneer', 'acknowledge', 'something', 'message', 'love', '4', 'guys', 'Liverpool', 'stood', 'warmed', 'even', 'iciest', 'hearts', 'McCartney', 'know', 'was', 'something', 'Russian', 'psyche', 'needed', 'respect', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'consummate', 'diplomat', 'generous', 'genuine', 'musical', 'ambassador', 'touring', 'Hermitage', 'Putin', 'how', 'touched', 'kids', 'orphanage', 'who', 'perform', 'are', 'dressed', 'Sunday', 'best', 'sensibility', 'only', 'working', 'class', 'kid', 'would', 'understand', 'recognize', 'important', 'also', 'quite', 'giggle', 'Russian', 'police', 'chasing', 'Red', 'Square', 'bicycle', 'no-no', 'not', 'caring', 'who', 'heck', 'laugh', 'Mac', 'Concert', 'Red', 'Square', 'St', 'Petersburg', 'shows', 'are', 'incredible', 'number', 'talking', 'heads', 'relate', 'tales', 'securing', 'Beatles', 'records', 'grew', 'up', 'rather', 'touching', 'get', 'picture', 'got', 'message', 'far', 'more', 'profoundly', 'west', 'band', 'stage', 'rush', 'crowd', 'exhilarating', 'Even', 'Putin', 'rockin', 'Back', 'USSR', 'KGB', 'body', 'guards', 'are', 'having', 'ball.McCartney', 'observations', 'Fool', 'A', 'Hill', 'clearly', 'indicate', 'what', 'music', 'people', 'determined', 'give', 'great', 'show', 'have', 'fun', 'brilliantly', 'Let', 'Be', 'Hey', 'Jude', 'crowd', 'times', 'verge', 'tears', 'particularly', 'one', 'old', 'fella', 'robust', 'singing', 'Jude', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'happened', 'Russia', 'where', 'such', 'enormous', 'pride', 'polyphonic', 'singing', 'Macca', 'stunned', 'how', 'strongly', 'crowd', 'in.The', 'experience', 'was', 'joyful', 'humbling', 'Having', 'met', 'Gorbachev', 'Putin', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'Russia', 'McCartney', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'parents', 'trip', 'voice', 'son', 'who', 'was', 'raised', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'who', 'parents', 'know', 'upheld', 'family', 'name', 'something', 'nationalities', 'ethnicities', 'genuine', 'article', 'film', 'great', 'music', 'profound', 'message']",N/A

Vick ""T.B.V.""","[18, 19]","This DVD is more than just a great concert, it is an historical look at how the Soviet Union and its citizens responded to the Beatles and their music in the 60's up until the fall of Communism in the late 80's early 90's.Intermittent between each of the songs is a story from McCartney, or a Russian individual. Certain Russian audience members who grew up in the 60's describe how the Beatles's music was banned in their country and how they took painstaking risks to buy their music and memorabilia (at the risk of being thrown in jail by the Soviet KGB). The DVD contains segments of interviews with former soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev describing how important Beatles music was to the Soviet people in a time of oppression. President Putin confirms these remarks by Gorbachev by describing how the Beatles were banned from the U.S.S.R. when he was younger and how he had an opportunity to hear several of their songs as a child (Putin shows up to the Moscow show in a very moving moment during the show).The DVD is very moving. In fact, during the Moscow concert many members of the audience are in tears as Paul plays the older Beatles's tunes. Several Soviet musicians from the 60's who are interviewed throughout the video describe how they had secret concerts, and secret gatherings to buy on the black market the Beatles's music. Many of these musicians describe how they were unable to obtain any Beatles music and had only one or two photo's of the band and would try to guess who was Paul or who was John, etc. in the photo (having not found out who each Beatles member was until much later).Aside from the history, the two concerts (one in Moscow and one in St. Petersburg) are fantastic. Paul plays many of the Beatles music intermittent with his own solo work. Some of the Beatles' tunes covered are, of course, 'Back in the U.S.S.R,' 'Fool on the Hill,' 'Birthday,''Helter Skelter,' 'We Can Work it Out,' 'She's Leaving Home,'I Saw Her Standing There,' 'Got to get You Into My Life,' 'Get Back,' 'Can't Buy Me Love,' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,' 'Drive My Car,' and many more.This is a fantastic DVD with all the essential 'Paul tunes' spanning his entire career. The added interviews, history, and shows simply make this one of the best DVD McCartney has ever released.

I eventually bought this, and really was pleasantly surprised.  For one, the significance of playing a concert in Moscow makes the extas quite compelling.  I will admit the line of reasoning that the Beatles were a major force in overthrowing communism may (or may not) be overstated, though.  Also, most of the extras are at the end of the song, so you can skip at that point and not miss the beginning of the next song.  ALSO, there is a full St. Petersburg concert, with few if any interuptions, and a few different songs.  The picture quality isn't as good as Moscow, but another great show.

That concert consisted of heavy Metal Bands like Motley Crue and Ozzy and it was just incredible the energy the fans had for an all-day event.  I has the opportunity to see this concert first on TV I think on A&E; or Bravo and again, I was just fascinated by the crowd.  This was a crowd that varied from teenagers to senior citizens, all singing and dancing to the music of Paul McCartney.  Even Vladamir Putin was there!  You know in seeing this that even the cold war and communists obviously could not keep the music of the Beatles out of the USSR.  This was truly a love affair if there ever was one.Speaking of energy, Paul just keeps going strong and is not only a great singer and musician, but a wonderful entertainer as well.  The concert consisted mostly of Beatle's songs and included many all-time McCartney classics such as Hey Jude, Let it Be, Back in the USSR, Yesterday, Can't Buy Me Love, and so many more.  Throughout, we see Paul travelling throughout Moscow and meeting average Joes (or ivans) on the street and it's almost like they are shaking hands with royalty.  For Paul's part, he is suitably humbled by the fans and seemed genuinely humbled by the reaction.  Just a great concert and the DVD offers a directors cut with even more material and featurettes as well.

When I read reviews on Amazon, I make sure to read the five star reviews along with the one or two star reviews. I like to get a real feeling of what I will possibly be purchasing. Interspersed with all the rave reviews for 'Paul McCartney - Live in Red Square' there is a smattering of reviewers who pan this DVD as 'unwatchable' and 'painful', to quote a couple of them, citing the constant switching of cameras as the main reason. The huge McCartney sycophants will give this 5 stars, regardless of the actual quality of the DVD, and those who dislike Paul for whatever reason are predisposed to giving bad reviews, so I suspected that the truth lie somewhere in the middle.As someone who has sat through many music videos that feature unsettling camera switches every second or two, shots that nauseatingly zoom in and out at warp speed, and rapid-fire angle changes that cause headaches if watched for more than a few seconds at a time, I was hesitant to purchase this DVD when I read the reviews about the camera work, even though I am a Beatles freak and a huge McCartney fan. Luckily, I found this DVD at my local library and checked it out. As much as it pains me to say this, I must agree with those who have a major problem with the constant switching of cameras and the overall unwatchability of this concert.What is it about the modern music video, and many of the television commercials nowadays, that feel the need to do this? I can only believe that it is geared toward people with little to no attention span whatever. I guess some people nowadays can't focus on an image for more than a couple of seconds without getting bored and grabbing the remote? I don't get it, but I know one thing, I am glad I didn't pay anything for this DVD. Great music, though! I don't know if this concert is available on CD, but if it is, I would HIGHLY recommend every McCartney freak, like me, to get it in that format, rather than this headache-inducing DVD.Sincerely, this DVD can do that to you. Some of the modern computer games have a warning that people who are prone to dizziness should not play the game. This DVD should probably have the same warning. That is my sincere opinion, and I honestly can't understand how it can receive so many five star reviews. I guess the annoying machine gun effect of the camera work doesn't affect most people the way it does me....I have to give this DVD two stars only, although the music gets five stars easily! It's just too difficult to sit through for more than a few minutes.
