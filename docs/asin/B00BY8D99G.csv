When her brother decides to film nearly every waking minute of her existence, things get shaken up very quickly! The few special effects in the film are just enough to make your skin crawl, as they do the woman's (literally!) Was it aliens who took over her body?

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[0, 1]","Is there anything yet new and innovative that can be found within that unique sub-culture of filmmaking: the found footage flick?  Meh, methinks as a narrative device it's just about run its course.  That doesn't mean that Hollywood won't continue turning them out: most appear to be relatively low-budget exercises that could be high on the R.O.I. (Return On Investment).  And, personally, I wouldn't want them to stop making them.  I enjoy them well enough (as anyone who has followed my reviews will tell you); I just wish they'd put a bit more thought into the stories.  Found footage works just fine as the gimmick, but, in the end, it's characters that make them work.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Liz (a perfectly mousey Erin Way) loses her baby in an unexplained miscarriage, putting her husband Rick (Eric Matheny) and her brother Evan (Ryan Smale) in the untenable position of helping her get her life back together and carry on.  Trying to capture some home memories as well as practicing his art as a film student, Evan opts to videotape their experiences.  Together, the three escape the city for the peace and quiet of a rural cabin.  However, as the days wear on, it becomes increasingly clear that something dark and sinister may be afoot involving Liz, Rick, and the disappeared fetus.On a mostly visceral level, ABSENCE works just fine.  There's nothing all that grand here, other than a few surprises with some clever special effects, exactly the kind of thing audiences have come to expect from ""found footage.""  However, to writer/director Jimmy Loweree's credit, he tries to give his film a bit more substance, choosing to make Evan a film student hoping to capture the emotional experience of what his sister has gone through (and continues to recover from) as one of his personal ""projects.""  Unfortunately, where this causes the film to break down is that Evan spends far too much time filming the insignificant minutiae of everyday life and not enough time just sitting and chatting with his sister and her husband.  Those scenes - in particular, the ones involving Liz's personal struggle - are quite good, quite stirring, as Way works wonders with the nuances of a broken soul who can't understand what she's been through.  In what could've been a real breakthrough performance for a gifted actress, the audience is only teased; instead, we're served up useless footage of shakycam going this way, shakycam going that way, and Evan's attempts to seduce a local girl (Megan, played by Stephanie Scholz) to be his temporary squeeze.Given the limitations of this story (as opposed to one that could've been) ABSENCE clocks in at 90 minutes, and that's simply 30 minutes too long to sustain my active interest.  Throughout the latter half, I started fast-forwarding once I realized I wasn't missing all that much from so much exposition surrounding so little interest.Still, I've seen far worse found footage than what's inevitably delivered.  I only wish that Loweree and his team's vision had extended beyond the flash and sizzle of this particular type of narrative in favor of turning out something a bit more memorable.  Those PARANORMAL ACTIVITY films really have this kind of film down to a science; Loweree's had the potential to expand upon the human component, especially with Way's gifts as an actress, and I would've liked to see more of that.ABSENCE (2013) is produced by Radcliffe Pictures.  DVD distribution is being handled by Cinedigm Entertainment Group.  As for the technical specifications, the video looks and sounds probably as well as the screenwriter and director intended it: this is one of those ""found footage"" films, so one can expect a certain amount of graininess, televised `snow,' and the usual trickery in advancing the story.  As for the special features, the disc comes with a director's commentary, a `making of' short, and the theatrical trailer: it's a nice collection for those genuinely interested in knowing a bit more about the story.(MODESTLY) RECOMMENDED.  While ABSENCE probably won't burn up the video charts, it's certainly an acceptable one-off rental for those who have a legitimate interest in ""found footage"" films, though I can't imagine anyone disinterested in them will find much to enjoy here.  As hard as writer/director Jimmy Loweree tries to make these characters more accessible to whatever audience he hoped to gather, ABSENCE works only as yet one more experience in the genre.  You can think of it as the set-up for a really great episode of THE X FILES because it's essentially the subject matter one would find FBI agents Mulder and Scully following up on, so if a twist of the paranormal is your thing, then you'll enjoy this more than most.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Cinedigm Entertainment Group provided me with a DVD copy of ABSENCE by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,Likeable ABSENCE Could've Been Something Bigger Than The Sum of Its Parts,1377475200,"08 26,

A woman is seven-months pregnant; then, her child suddenly disappears from her womb. Then, her family and she disappear into the woods for a vacation after this traumatic event. Much like the Blair Witch Project, viewers see the actors much, much, much more than they see any creatures or special effects in the movie. Much like in Paranormal Activity, scary events happen mostly subtly and on a small-scale. Many found-footage movies have followed this cast-centric approach recently. Perhaps, they do so for budgetary reasons. Absence is the best film of this type that Absence can be. The performances are strong. These actors can act. I was actually very impressed with the main three cast members. The dialogue is witty and realistic.

1640914,A28Q9BSUOWJ8BI,B00BY8D99G,Josh,"[4, 6]","I am a big horror fan, and like any horror fan, you start to get used to the rhythm of horror movies. Start with a big scare not necessarily including the main characters, introduce the leads, have lesser characters die off, big scare ending. This movie was going for something a little different. As opposed to a lot of horror movies where the drama and comedy seem like after thoughts, in Absence they were almost more the meat of the movie. Don't get me wrong, there are some really creepy moments, and the finale is satisfyingly nuts, but what I liked most was how much I found myself caring about the characters.  The actress playing Liz especially is excellent and delivers some very emotionally powerful stuff. And her brother Evan had me laughing out loud and was way more genuinely funny than a lot of the cheesy humor in a lot of horror movies. When Absence was working best, it felt a lot like hanging out with friends who you really cared about. If I had one complaint, I thought it could have maybe cut back a little bit on the ""this-is-found-footage-so-here-is-a-boring-shot-of-the-kitchen"" type moments, but it was not too bad at all with those and certainly better than some other found footage type movies I have seen.

1640915,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00BY8D99G,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 4]","Utilizing the increasingly popular ""found footage"" genre that combines elements of the thriller into a faux documentary presentation, ""Absence"" takes a rather slight story and serves up exactly what you might expect. I suspect that some may absolutely loathe ""Absence,"" and I can understand their frustration.  People anticipating a full-on horror show based on how the movie is portrayed in its own marketing material and description will likely be disappointed.  There is some creepiness, but this presentation doesn't show you much of anything that will actually scare you.  For most of its running time, it is a veritable home movie chronicling the vacation of its three central characters.  I actually found the trio passably entertaining, so I didn't mind hanging out with them.  But if you're looking for more in-your-face chills, this stays relatively uneventful until its final moments.  The action picks up for the conclusion, but it lacked any real element of surprise. It's reasonably well made and the actors are appealing enough. It just lacks impact from a plotting standpoint. You've seen it all before and oftentimes better.The movie starts with an intriguing premise.  A young mother-to-be (Erin Way) awakens one day to discover that she is no longer with child despite having been seven months pregnant.  This tease is presented quickly and the movie fast forwards as the woman, her husband (Eric Matheny) and her brother (Ryan Smale) are embarking on a get-away to escape the scrutiny, skepticism, and accusations of the local town people and the authorities.  Attempting to keep things light, Smale is filming everything for a school project (a rather thin premise, to be sure, as it requires him to have the camera even at the most harrowing and inopportune moments).  As they settle into a rural existence, Way pushes past her trauma, the boys bicker playfully, and Smale even finds a local lady to court.  It's all roses and sunshine for our vacationers, but they are still obviously haunted by prior events.  Just what happened to the unborn fetus?  Increasingly unsettling events start to rock this idyllic paradise and, before all is said and done, the truth will ultimately reveal itself.Filmmaker Jimmy Loweree has an easy enough touch with the material and the actors.  Way is surprisingly effective as a woman on the edge, just getting her footing back only to have it knocked away again.  And Smale, who we spend the most time with, has an appealing energy.  I found him amusing, thankfully.  If you don't like him, the movie is pretty much sunk from the get-go as he is always present in one way or another.  In terms of set-up, I'd have liked a bit more of the hostility and suspicion that this woman was faced with at home.  We see a brief snippet of it, but it is largely cast off as a joke.  In the end, the major revelations were handled efficiently, even if they weren't particularly surprising.  Most of the movie, however, is like watching someone else's home movie.  4 Stars for the actors, 3 Stars grading this as a ""thriller.""  I liked ""Absence,"" but it adheres too closely to a formula that I've seen way too often in modern independent cinema.  About 3 1/2 stars, I wished the picture had taken more chances.

In the end, the pay-off is forgettable as it is chaotic. Lost between the insipid shots of running feet and the inevitable found-footage shenanigans is a strong performance by Erin Way as the mother, who plays her key scenes with dignity and delicate beauty.",2,"One lovely performance, buried in drek",1378598400,"09 8, 2013",2013,458,"['early', 'stages', 'are', 'rendered', 'largely', 'unwatchable', 'obnoxious', 'brother/cameraman', 'too-many', 'would-be', 'scary', 'scenes', 'either', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'often', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'going', 'end', 'pay-off', 'forgettable', 'chaotic', 'Lost', 'insipid', 'shots', 'running', 'feet', 'inevitable', 'found-footage', 'shenanigans', 'strong', 'performance', 'Erin', 'Way', 'mother', 'who', 'key', 'scenes', 'dignity', 'delicate', 'beauty']",N/A
