After all, have you ever seen one that was any good?  Maybe the first ""Poseiden Adventure"" I suppose.  Perhaps ""Titanic"" had its moments.  But then again you might argue, ""Well, why did you rent this film then?"" and you'd have a point.  Now, I'll get onto that point.I used to live in Seattle, but I just got too tired of the rain - and all those really friendly people, some of whom you will see on screen - so I decided it was time to move.  And while I lived in Seattle, I was not there at the time of the protests.  I was out of the country at the time, so I had to watch this fine city get torched to the ground from afar.  I guess that it was better than being there based upon the actual footage that's in this very-mediocre-at-best film.  But anyway, I decided to rent this movie since I wanted to see what happened finally, many years later.Now, this is a fictionalized account.  I wanted to also watch because I had just reviewed ""Young Adult"" - which I really liked - and I noticed that Charlize Theron was in this one as well.  In ""Battle"" she plays a gal who is married to a cop, where she is pregnant.  Now, some very artificial plot device is used to show how his line of work adversely effects her and therefore both of them.  Won't say what that device is, but I will say the following:  Ugh.Now, for full disclosure, I'm not much of a fan of protests and protesters over all, especially in the United States.  ""What do you have to protest about?  Having to pay slightly higher gas prices?"" might be a question I might ask.  While I fully realize that this country is far from perfect, we don't really have it all that bad so, why do people put their lives on the line for such pointless reasons?Well, protesting is your right, and protest away.  But it's hard to protest the following:  this movie is pretty forgettable.  And this movie probably shouldn't have been made.

Featuring an impressive, but not distracting, all-star cast, ""Battle In Seattle"" presents an effective and engaging look at the motivations behind those forces who want to control the world's marketplace, with those who will fight for freedom, opportunity and balance in commerce.  Regardless of one's political or economic leanings, the film holds the audience by presenting the human-drama endured by participants on both sides of the police lines.  Townsend handles his cast with skill and grace, perhaps borne from years of his own experience in front of the camera.

Townsend is a sweetheart and brave soul to care about the impact this event had on our city, and the world at large.  Thank you for coming here and creating this film!  It is well done, and I'm gratified by much of the original network news footage as well as the storyline.This film will speak to young Americans just coming to understand how our economics impact the planet.  Some characters may seem cheesy, but I found them to be authentic, easy to identify with for the most part.  Yes, many people were tear-gassed and beaten in the streets for peaceful protesting.  Yes, this went for 3 solid days, here in the heart of Seattle.  Yes, I had a friend sleeping on my couch for a few nights, since he couldn't SEE after being tear-gassed.  Yes, some children were tear-gassed, walking as pedestrians with their parents down the street.  Yes, the city was under curfew and citizens were told to stay in their homes.  And yes, the streets of our city were completely ripped-up.  All the shop windows were kicked in and...  Well, it all had an interesting way of addressing our materialism!  Just in time for the Christmas shopping season.  YAY!(Seattle has not been the same since.)What makes this film important is, it does give some human documentation to the FIRST international protest which was ever organized on the internet.Into the third day of protests, media attempted to keep national news reports on the down-low; we had to tune-in to PBS in order to find out what was happening.  For many, it represents the beginning of the needed CHANGE we were to strive for - - coming into nine long years later! After the events of 9/11, the war in Iraq, and with the election of Barack Obama.  The true-life story behind this film shows us how hard-earned change can be; that it does not happen overnight.  It happens in small revolutions of people, coming together with united intention.As America falls into a recession which affects all nations, globally, and as we continue to work at pulling ourselves out of the wars in the Middle East, this film is an important, informative way to educate yourself on our global economic issues and the needs for change.  If you're without a job right now, see if you can rent this film and think about the possibility of going to work for PEACE.  If you need a little inspiration about root networks?

The premise of the movie has to do with the WTO conference held in Seattle in 1999, when riots broke out and violence escalated between rioters and the police. There are three 'camps' in this movie - the first are the protestors, as played by Michelle Rodriguez, Martin Henderson, Jennifer Carpenter and Andre Benjamin. The second is the mayor who is trying his best to coordinate the event without too much interference or disruption [the mayor's role is portrayed by Ray Liotta], and finally, there's the couple looking forward to their first baby [played by Woody Harrelson in a cop role & Charlize Theron] and how the riots impact their lives.The action almost never lets up from the get go - as a viewer, I almost felt like I was there during the riots, its so real and well-portrayed. Townsend effectively weaves in the storytelling with actual video footage of the events as it happened back in 1999. The cast does an excellent job as well, credibly portraying the various story arcs, especially those of the protestors and Michelle Rodriguez's performance is a highlight in this movie. The story arc featuring Wooody Harrelson and Charlize Theron struck a rather false note for me, and seemed overly melodramatic. On the whole though, this is quite a powerful movie with a compelling voice and I highly recommend it to those who love social dramas focused on activism.",4,Gripping drama based on true events,1251244800,"08 26, 2009",2009,1760,"['knew', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'prior', 'watching', 'movie', '[', 'ably', 'directed', ']', 'was', 'actor', 'also', 'boyfriend', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Well', 'Battle', 'Seattle', 'directing', 'talent', 'reputable', 'cast', 'too', 'movie', 'riveting', 'watch', 'beginning', 'when', 'brief', 'history', 'how', 'WTO', 'came', 'about', 'shown', 'right', 'very', 'end', 'premise', 'movie', 'do', 'WTO', 'conference', 'held', 'Seattle', '1999', 'when', 'riots', 'broke', 'out', 'violence', 'escalated', 'rioters', 'police', 'are', 'three', ""'camps"", 'movie', 'first', 'are', 'protestors', 'played', 'Michelle', 'Rodriguez', 'Martin', 'Henderson', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'Andre', 'Benjamin', 'second', 'mayor', 'who', 'trying', 'best', 'coordinate', 'event', 'too', 'much', 'interference', 'disruption', 'mayor', 'role', 'portrayed', 'Ray', 'Liotta', ']', 'finally', 'couple', 'looking', 'forward', 'first', 'baby', '[', 'played', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'cop', 'role', 'Charlize', 'Theron', ']', 'how', 'riots', 'impact', 'lives.The', 'action', 'almost', 'never', 'up', 'get', 'go', 'viewer', 'almost', 'felt', 'was', 'there', 'riots', 'so', 'real', 'well-portrayed', 'Townsend', 'effectively', 'weaves', 'storytelling', 'actual', 'video', 'footage', 'events', 'happened', 'back', '1999', 'cast', 'excellent', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'credibly', 'portraying', 'various', 'story', 'arcs', 'especially', 'protestors', 'Michelle', 'Rodriguez', 'performance', 'highlight', 'movie', 'story', 'arc', 'featuring', 'Wooody', 'Harrelson', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'struck', 'rather', 'false', 'note', 'seemed', 'overly', 'melodramatic', 'whole', 'though', 'quite', 'powerful', 'movie', 'compelling', 'voice', 'highly', 'recommend', 'who', 'love', 'social', 'dramas', 'focused', 'activism']",N/A
