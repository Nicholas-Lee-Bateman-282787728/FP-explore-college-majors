It's.. wow.. aliens are more humane than us, humans. Good thing that more people see us as brutal, cruel creatures, an infection tot his world. Maybe something will eventually change. I liked the utopia where finally our planet and everything on it has reached peace. I also loved how those aliens were depicted, loving, gentle creatures that look nothing like animals or human-like creatures, yet they are everything great that we (generally) are not. I just loved them so much! It may sound like nothing specially exciting, but when you see it, you'll probably like it.

They will honestly hate it and throw it up to you later for forcing them. Be smart and go with your Mom, Sister or girlfriends ONLY. This IS A CHICK FLICK! In every sense of the WORD.Tonight I just viewed ""The Host' with my beloved husband in tow. This turned out to be a bad idea. We started out to see ""The Croods"", but it was sold out and I talked him into seeing ""The Host"". Poor guy had no idea what he was in for. I wasn't sure either. I had hoped it would be good. It was somewhat entertaining to me, but only in that I had never read the book so the story was new to me. I had a pretty good idea about the story line and had hoped he might enjoy it a little. I enjoyed it more then I thought I would. He did not. It was well acted, and emotional in some parts but...very,...very...slow. Over all a fair film. Nothing to brag about though. My husband on the other hand wants me to send out a warning to all of his male brethren out there...***WARNING***BEFORE YOU SEE THIS MOVIE READ THIS!!!DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS IF YOUR'RE A MAN!!!!!YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF STICKING A FORK IN YOUR EYE THEN TO SIT THROUGH THIS MOVIE!!!!!LET HER SEE IT WITH HER FRIENDS!!!!!He only enjoyed the films desert scenery. I liked it too. The cinematography was beautiful in this film, but a bit repetitious. Many of the same rock formation scenes were used repeatedly. Meanwhile he was sitting beside me screaming inside his head...""ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?!!""Also: He seriously wants to know if Stephenie Meyers is capable of making a story/movie that men would enjoy?Well, I got that off his chest for him. Whew!So I must now repay him for watching this ""film of torture"" for me. I will be sitting through ""The Croods"" very soon! I don't mind. I can review it! ""The Host"" is a one time viewing for me and never again for my husband.I myself ONLY recommend this film to true Stephenie Meyer fans, and even then they may not like it. Everyone else, save it for cable so you can turn it off when you want to and go outside for a walk instead. Enjoy!Release Date: 29 March 2013Running Time: 125 minutesRated: PG-13 for violence, language and sexual content.Science Fiction/RomanceGrade: C-Up date: Ha! I don't have to see ""The Croods""!

So, where have we seen a theme of two males lusting after a single female before? Twilight, of course. I didn't find Twilight to be as boring until the last one I watched, though.The premise itself doesn't make any sense. The world is taken over by advanced aliens that can occupy the bodies of humans, but then must share their memories and the host can even resist the alien parasite. The parasite can even be sympathetic with the host. Somehow there is still a resistance. They're able to conquer almost the entire world, but small pockets somehow survive.

1581253,A3DUGD68BZCDAW,B0090SI4LU,Annie,"[4, 5]","* caution: some mild spoilers *I have to admit that, based on some of the reviews I read, I wasn't expecting to like this movie. However, I found it extremely enjoyable. It's possible that my enjoyment of the movie is attributable to a) the fact that I loved the book (and therefore the plot) so much, and b) that I watched it with initially low expectations. Having seen it a couple times, I won't say that it's a masterpiece, but it definitely held my interest and I do enjoy it.Regarding the benefits of READING THE BOOK FIRST:I absolutely loved the book, and have read and reread it countless times. As such, the plot and content of the book was in my mind as I watched the movie. This allowed me, I believe, to fill in certain gaps and moments of inadequacy in the movie plot and acting (there were a couple iffy moments with the male leads, although overall they were believable), as well as some clich&eacute;d or corny dialogue, and some important aspects of the character and plot development that I felt were present in the book, but lacking in the movie. For example, if I had watched the movie without reading the book, I don't think I would get the same sense of the affection/love building between Wanda and Melanie, nor would I get the extent of the conflict Wanda experienced in terms of her feelings for both Jared and Ian, or her different reactions to each. Things seemed to happen rather quickly and more superficially in the movie, although some of that may have been necessary (considering the timing and medium). Regardless, I do think that some of my enjoyment of this movie was most likely contingent on my love of the book.So, this is my advice to anyone contemplating watching or buying it: first of all, don't expect a cinematic masterpiece. This movie is no Twilight franchise, for Stephanie Meyers fans, so watch it for what it is.  If you want an enjoyable couple of hours, go for it.  I also suggest reading the book prior to watching the movie, if you really want to have a good idea of the journey that Wanda (and the humans she comes to love) undergoes.",4,enjoyable and entertaining; might want to read the book first,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,2088,"['*', 'caution', 'mild', 'spoilers', '*I', 'have', 'admit', 'based', 'reviews', 'read', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'like', 'movie', 'However', 'found', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'possible', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'attributable', 'fact', 'loved', 'book', 'therefore', 'plot', 'so', 'much', 'b', 'watched', 'initially', 'low', 'expectations', 'Having', 'seen', 'couple', 'times', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'masterpiece', 'definitely', 'held', 'interest', 'do', 'enjoy', 'it.Regarding', 'benefits', 'READING', 'THE', 'BOOK', 'FIRST', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'book', 'have', 'read', 'reread', 'countless', 'times', 'such', 'plot', 'content', 'book', 'was', 'mind', 'watched', 'movie', 'allowed', 'believe', 'fill', 'certain', 'gaps', 'moments', 'inadequacy', 'movie', 'plot', 'acting', 'were', 'couple', 'iffy', 'moments', 'male', 'overall', 'were', 'believable', 'as', 'well', 'clich', 'eacute', 'corny', 'dialogue', 'important', 'aspects', 'character', 'plot', 'development', 'felt', 'were', 'present', 'book', 'lacking', 'movie', 'example', 'had', 'watched', 'movie', 'reading', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'get', 'same', 'sense', 'affection/love', 'building', 'Wanda', 'Melanie', 'would', 'get', 'extent', 'conflict', 'Wanda', 'experienced', 'terms', 'feelings', 'Jared', 'Ian', 'different', 'reactions', 'Things', 'seemed', 'happen', 'rather', 'quickly', 'more', 'superficially', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'necessary', 'considering', 'timing', 'medium', 'Regardless', 'do', 'think', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'was', 'most', 'likely', 'contingent', 'love', 'book.So', 'advice', 'anyone', 'contemplating', 'watching', 'buying', 'first', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'movie', 'Twilight', 'franchise', 'Stephanie', 'Meyers', 'fans', 'so', 'watch', 'what', 'want', 'enjoyable', 'couple', 'hours', 'go', 'also', 'suggest', 'reading', 'book', 'prior', 'watching', 'movie', 'really', 'want', 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'journey', 'Wanda', 'humans', 'love', 'undergoes']",The Host

1581255,A1DQEYIQ9FK3JL,B0090SI4LU,"Asa Bunnett ""Verboseman""","[7, 14]","The Host is the type of movie that every viewer will go into view with an opinion already formed.  Fans of the Stephanie Meyer novel it is based on will go in hoping for a faithful adaption of their beloved story.  And if internet backlash can be believed, a not-insignificant portion will also go in deriding it as the blackest scorch mark on the face of cinema and literature yet seen by mankind.  You already know which group you fall into, and film version of The Host will not change your mind at all.For my part, I land firmly in the latter camp of Host-decriers, perhaps not with the same fiery and virulent hatred that some possess, but still pretty firmly put off by the two distressingly long hours of its running time.  It's not a particularly long film, but watching it is a small eternity filled with nothing but unintentionally hilarious melodrama, painfully dull set-pieces, nonsensical plotting, interchangeable characters, passionless romance, and occasional offensiveness.Gleefully rubbing salt in the wound is the fact that the opening ten minutes is actually fairly compelling.  Our protagonist Melanie is in a bit of a tight spot, hunted down by mere shells of humans, their bodies controlled by small aliens resembling fuzzy slugs.  If this was the `90's, this would have been an action movie called Animorphs, but these are the teenage years of the 21st century, and we instead get an awkward romance called The Host instead.  Thanks, Hollywood.  Admittedly, it's one with rather high stakes - humanity as we know it is all but gone, with nearly every person alive taken over by aliens.Melanie brilliantly escapes by jumping out of a six-story window and putting herself in a coma.  The somber alien-men scoop her up from the crater left in the concrete and slide a new slug-alien into her.  This alien - Wanderer, as she likes to be called - is meant to help find the last of the human resistance using Melanie's remaining memories.  As they soon find out, though, Melanie's mind is not snuffed out like most humans.  She stays around, now effectively a disembodied voice sharing a body with the meek and unemotional Wanderer.How exactly this works is never made clear.  The Host has as much internal consistency as an unblended smoothie.  Sometimes Melanie can take control, other times she's completely helpless and unable to even make herself heard.  Melanie eventually tricks Wanderer into leaving the safety of the alien society, and meeting up with the human resistance.  From there on out, the film turns into a romance between Melanie's boyfriend from before her assimilation, and another boy Ian, who falls for the alien in her head.And that's it.  I'm going to be honest - no matter what anyone says, as a concept, The Host has an excellent premise.  Besides the huge potential for backstory and setting - it's our own world, run by an entirely different species - the concept of two intelligences sharing the same body could make for some seriously compelling science fiction.  What relation does the intellect have with the body?  Are we only what others see us to be?  Are we all, to some extent, a prisoner in our own minds?But no, we'd much rather see some ham-fisted romance, corny dialogue, and senseless plotting.  The larger overarching questions about the fate of humanity are never answered over the film's running time.  Neither is the ""sharing a body"" element ever used in any thought-provoking manner, other than to set up the film's awkward love-quadrilateral.  It's a massive missed opportunity.Beyond that, the implications here are seriously problematic.  As Wanderer is gradually accepted into the human resistance group, everyone involved seems remarkably uninterested in the fact that her people have essentially committed genocide on a massive scale.  Not to mention the burgeoning relationship between her and Ian.  It's a fluffy, insubstantial love story that one would expect from a teen movie, where emotion springs from nowhere and passion is a synonym for idiocy.  But factor in the fact that Melanie is watching helplessly as Ian kisses Wanderer with her own body, and what would have been only eye-roll inducing is now borderline sickening.Hyperbole is cheap, and The Host has had its fair share directed its way.  But it is, without exaggeration, an embarrassingly bad film.  There simply isn't enough space to list its problems - sets that are completely indistinguishable from each other, lackluster performances, gaping plot-holes, and a shockingly poor grasp of basic science (growing crops in a dormant volcano IN NEW MEXICO) only brush the surface of all that's wrong with it.  Perhaps - as several people have insisted to me - the book is much better.  I would call that damning with faint praise, but by all means, stick with the book and avoid this one like you would a fuzzy white pocket-lint alien slug.",1,Crippling Your Interesting Premise With

I do like the movies (even though i thought Eclipse was WEAK), i read Twilight and thought some of it was boring and tried to read the rest of the Twilight books but they just didn't hold any interest for me. Out of all of the Twilight movies the last two movies (Breaking Dawn part 1 and 2) of the series are my favorites.Now onto Stephanie Meyers's The Host. I didn't read the book, i thought about reading it before i saw the movie, but i just said forget it and decided to watch the movie instead. I don't know how the book is, but personally i really don't care because i REALLY LIKED this movie. I thought it was such an interesting story, and no offense to the Twilight fans, but i think this book/movie is a little bit more realistic (alien's taking over our bodies) rather than believing vampires and werewolves are real.If there was an alien race like this, than i would hope that we as humans can still fight them, even when they have taken over our bodies. And that's what Melanie does, even though Wanderer/Wanda has taken over Melanie's body, she is still in there.If you really liked the book, then there might be a chance you might not like the movie. When i was a teenager i loved the book ""Blood and Chocolate"" and when they finally made a movie out of it, i was excited. I watched the movie and absolutely HATED IT. I was angry that they didn't even TRY to get as close to the book as possible.Whenever they transfer a book into a movie, they never get as good as the book, they try (most of the time), but they never quite get it perfect. That's because books have a lot more detail than movies, and if you wanted everything perfect like the book, the movie would probably be 3 or 4 hours long. This movie was two hours and ten minutes.I would love it if Stephanie Meyers did a sequal to this book so they could make a sequal to the movie, because i feel that there can definitely be more to this story. If you are an alien/sci-fi fan then you might like it. I would say watch it first and then decide.

After the tremendous success of ""Twilight"" it was probably a given that her fortune would continue. ""Twilight"" was more of a phenomenon than a critical success and Meyers seemed to tap into exactly what teen audiences are looking for, a little action, a little fantasy and a whole lot of young males without shirts. Oh, and don't forget love triangles.""The Host"", to Meyer's credit, is nothing like her ""Twilight"" series. There are no vampires or werewolves, but there are aliens who have, for the most part, taken over the world. If you have seen the movie ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (original, remake or second remake), you get the gist of what kind of aliens we are dealing with, although not near as scary.Saoirse Ronan plays Melanie/Wanderer/Wanda a girl who leads a resistance with her brother and love interest Jared, played by young hunk Max Irons. When the alien invaders capture her, she's implanted with the soul of one of those aliens and is given a new name, Wanderer. Yet, for some reason Melanie is stronger than most and the two personalities co-exist in the same body. It's all sort of complicated but the jostling that goes on, secretly between Wanderer and Melanie is the most interesting part of the movie. Not to mention, it was a creative and different way for Meyers to insert one of her most important ingredients for success; the love triangle.""The Host"" is at its core, just a different take on the ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" story line. Instead of death and helplessness, ""The Host"" focuses on hopefulness and handsome teenage boys fighting over two souls in one girl. The bad thing is, I was hoping for a few more death and helplessness moments. Anything would have helped to spruce things up. The movie is slow and uninteresting. The director and writers hoped that the relationship between Melanie/Wanderer and her two men, Ian and Jared, would be enough to suffice, but it isn't. The music score doesn't help much either, but I sure would love to pull that music score, put it to CD and use it for those difficult nights when sleep is troublesome.Honestly, I think there was some potential with this film, but it would have served better had it been presented as a television mini-series instead of a money making follow up to ""Twilight"". They banked on the fact that those same loyal followers would throw their money in Meyer's direction again, but instead they most likely only hurt the Meyers brand.

The concept of a ""perfect"" inhuman society imposed upon ""imperfect"" humans was the source of conflict.  As an imperfect human I would prefer imperfection, since I believe the vacant desire for perfection is one that exists only in the mind of those who wish perfection of others and are dissatisfied with their own being.  The perfect, or emotionless and mindless society advanced by ""superior"" beings may be a view into the future.  But what price must humans pay for such boring perfection?  There must never be a guarantee of a perfect, intellectually and emotionally dead society when the individual has so much humanity within.  If there is a message to this film it is for individuals to fight against the domination of a society that pursues some goal of inhuman mechanistic perfection in exchange for comfort.  Life is not lived for the anesthetic comforts a society or government can deliver in exchange for its preservation of power.  Life is a vital experience to be lived without the presence of dictates of those who believe they know better than any individual how a life must be lived and experienced in full.

For most of the humans who have been taken over by the aliens, the aliens will overpowers and eliminates most of the humans will. A select few humans are still alive and fighting back by sheer force of their will.The primary character Melanie played very well by actress Saoirse Ronan, has a very strong will to survive and the love she has for her family keeps her fighting despite having to play host in her mind and body to an alien.

Yes, there is that element here too. The male leads are the traditional pretty boys of that genre and they do a lot of kissing of teen girl, Ronan. Also there is much angst and emotional misunderstanding amongst the cute ones. (Oy!) But... there is an interesting science fiction story here, that really caught my attention. Earth has been successfully invaded by parasitic aliens who can take over a human's body and live their life as if they were human beings, except they are nonviolent. There are few uninfected people left and they must live by their wits to escape the fate of most of mankind. What I found interesting was that the story was told from the viewpoint of a recently arrived alien being named Wanderer... eventually nick named Wanda by the wild humans who capture her and her host. Her experiences with uninfected humans turns her (borrowed) head around in a way that causes her to rethink her specie's parasitic lifestyle, and brings her to a courageous decision at the end.If Stephanie Meyer reads this, I'd ask that you consider writing any possible sequels for adults, if that is at all possible.

If so, did you ever think, ""If only the aliens would realize what special snowflakes humans are! If only humans would realize that parasitic brain-squids that steal unwilling victims' bodies aren't bad!""Of course you didn't. Nobody with half a brain would.But Stephenie Meyer did. The result: a soft sci-fi movie called ""The Host,"" which takes a promising idea (what if the body-snatching aliens WON?) and promptly runs it into the ground. Not only is there pretty much no plot to this movie, but it is riddled with flat characters and a total lack of any kind of excitement. Oh, and there's the romanticizing of aliens who steal bodies.In the not-too-distant future, the Earth has been completely conquered by a race of glowing brain-squids known as Souls (ugh), who possess human bodies. Only a few actual humans are left. When one girl named Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan) is captured by the Seekers, she becomes the new host for a Soul named Wanderer.Immediately after Wanderer is implanted, a Seeker (Diane Kruger) tries to find out where the other humans are hiding. However, the real Melanie is still there, inside her own head -- and her memories begin to affect Wanderer.When the Seeker's plans threaten Melanie's life, Wanderer/Melanie escape into the desert in search of Melanie's boyfriend Jared (Max Irons), little brother Jamie (Chandler Canterbury) and the other free humans. However, they aren't too pleased to find a Soul-possessed Melanie in their midst. And even as Wanderer (renamed ""Wanda"") tries to gain their trust, she finds herself falling for someone who isn't Jared.It's hard to express just how brain-meltingly dull ""The Host"" is. After Melanie escapes from the Seekers, the movie slows to the pace of half-frozen mud and never speeds up again. Occasionally something dramatic will happen -- the Seeker's attack, Jamie's life-threatening injury -- but it's always neatly resolved in just a few minutes.Instead, most of the movie revolves around a tepid love triangle, and Wanda just hanging around the human compound, harvesting wheat and smooching teen boys. As if the lack of a plot weren't bad enough, we're constantly tortured by Melanie's screeching inner monologue, which tends to break up any moments that could have been quiet.And really, it wouldn't be a Stephenie Meyer movie unless it romanticized parasitic creatures -- in this case, glowing CGI squids that physically respond to love, peace and kindness. Excuse me while I vomit. Don't expect the movie to address the horrific moral implications of stealing an unwilling victim's body, either -- that would be too deep and intense for a movie like this.Saoirse Ronan is one of my favorite up-and-coming young actresses, and she does seem to be giving the role her all. But it's a losing battle. Though the movie assures us that Melanie is a rare and special creature with amazing inner strength, she comes across as a bland, utterly typical teen girl with no special qualities whatsoever.Most of the other actors are completely wasted -- the characters have no development, no history and no motivations. Even the love interests are difficult to tell apart because there's almost nothing to  distinguish them. It makes the whole movie feel drained of any drama, because we don't know these characters enough to care -- when two humans commit suicide to avoid the Seekers, all I could think was, ""Who were they again? Did they even have lines?""""The Host"" is an utter failure as a sci-fi movie -- it takes a good idea and squanders it on a tepid, sluggish story that never bothers to have a real plot.

1581308,A11ZCZ874OORU0,B0090SI4LU,"EJ ""EJ""","[0, 0]","The Hollywood label of ""science fiction"" sadly mostly denotes violent movies with aliens killing people, lots of special effects and little to really tease the mind. This is the opposite--a rare science fiction film which focuses on ideas and human stories, and which appeals to our imaginations.What I love about this movie is how it convincingly and chillingly portrays an imagined future world. Creating a futuristic world (particularly a dystopian one) is the main strength of director Andrew Niccol and he did it beautifully here. The sterile and orderly look of an earth taken over by aliens, superior in some ways to us, was brilliantly done--down to the chilling grocery stores devoid of brand names and even checkout counters. There's one thirty-second scene in a store which, at least for me, was worth the entire movie.But the brilliant world building was completely eclipsed by one of the worst scripts I have ever seen in any movie. Usually even the most boring hackneyed scripts are at least reasonably professional in a dull conventional kind of way. This one--while tantalizingly creative--was simply amateurish. It almost completely failed to meet the most basic requirement of building a plot arc that keeps us interested and engaged...not to mention poor character development and flat, dull dialog. The excellent actors, William Hurt and Saoirse Ronan among others, did a valiant job with almost nothing to work with, but oh, what a waste of such a great cast!Like the book, the movie script focused on emotional and human impact of the alien-themed plot, rather than on violence and action. I like that. But, the movie script--like the book--slogged along with no strong plot tension, no sense of timing or urgency, poor dialog, nonexistent character development. This is due largely to it fairly closely following the book, which was wonderful, for an amateur writer, but it just didn't have what was needed to make it into a good movie. Someone should have had the guts give the movie the professional overhaul it desperately needed.  If they'd taken the book as a starting point and hired a competent, seasoned writer to revamp it completely, this movie could have been on the level of Gattaca.It's sad really. I don't know if Andrew Niccol didn't know how to reimagine it or if he didn't have the go-ahead to do so. But if you're a fan of real science fiction (about ideas, not about violence) and if you like dystopic tales, you should see this anyway.

1581312,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B0090SI4LU,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[0, 1]","I'm one of the only males on the planet Earth who actually admit to liking the ""Twilight"" movies and books. That being said, I have to say I was excited when I heard sci-fi Director Andrew Niccol was adapting Stephenie Meyer's other novel, ""The Host,"" for the big screen. ""Gattaca"" was widely acclaimed and even ""In Time"" received mixed reviews. I was hoping Niccol would at least find a happy medium in between those two and give author Meyer's fans something to be proud of. Unfortunately, I didn't get what I wanted upon viewing the movie.Aliens have invaded Earth and taken over the bodies of humans as hosts. The process erases the memories of most of the victims. However, a select few have been found to be strong-willed and fight for their individuality and humanity. Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan) is such a person. Her drive to save her brother (Chandler Canterbury) and boyfriend (Max Irons) from being captured by the aliens creates turmoil within. Melanie battles the entity inside her for control of her body and mind.I'm going to compare ""The Host"" to ""Twilight"" throughout this review. There's no way to avoid it, so I'll just embrace it and suffer the wrath of millions of Meyer's enthusiasts worldwide. The similarities are too obvious. Both feature a love triangle and deal with a female facing the loss of her humanity. Yes, one is a vampire and the other is an alien. Aren't we just splitting hairs here?Let's talk about the good aspects of ""The Host"" to begin. The cinematography looks beautiful and adds grand scale to the production. With the exception of one or two scenes, the CGI is convincing and doesn't pull you out of the film. That's more than can be said about the ""Twilight"" movies. Most the acting comes off as genuine, although there's definitely some heavy-handed dialogue for the actors to fumble through.We now move on to the negative aspects found in ""The Host."" Saoirse Ronan's inner dialogue gets tiresome very quick. I can't necessarily tell you what filmmakers could have used in place of it, but it became painful within the first few minutes after it started. Secondly, the action sequences in the film almost feel forced. I haven't read the book, so I can't tell you if they were added or expanded to give guys ANYTHING to enjoy when they're girlfriends make them watch this.There's nothing too threatening about ""The Host"" as far as subject matter is concerned. It's a bunch of new age-sounding gobbledegoo about living in harmony with everyone and striving for peace on Earth. It also endeavors to show people can overcome incredible obstacles if they just put their minds to the task. There are a few scenes of sensuality between the three main characters which some will find offensive.The DVD release of ""The Host"" comes with a few special features for those interested. The featurette ""Bringing 'The Host' To Life"" includes interviews and behind-the-scenes footage.

I thought maybe the lead character's search for individuality and self-worth would be compelling, but more time was spent on deciding which boy she likes kissing more.

1581316,A1IN5SYPOTFRH7,B0090SI4LU,Felecia Jenkins,"[7, 11]","As someone who read the book prior to seeing the movie adaptation of The Host, I have to say that I had very high expectations going into the film. And, if I'm being totally honest, the film did not measure up to the incredible world created within the pages of Meyer's novel. That being said, however, I feel that it is imperative to also point out that movie adaptations of novels ALWAYS come with limitations. It is impossible to fully capture everything that makes the book great in the allotted two-hour timeframe of a typical movie. And The Host was certainly no exception to this rule. Still, I did find this movie to be entertaining and compelling in and of itself for a number of reasons:*NOTE: Spoilers ahead.*1. Saorise Ronan does a good job portraying two characters trapped in the same body. She accurately depicts Wanda's rigid, alien way of speaking, as well as throwing in a slightly southern-twinged accent for Melanie, who hails from Louisiana in the film. All in all, I felt that she was a strong female lead for the film.2. Max Irons gives an impressive, albeit limited, performance of Jared Howe. Irons was able to capture the struggle and hurt of Jared (caused by losing Mel and then having her body return with another soul inside) and convincingly portray those emotions on-screen. The only criticism I have about this character in the movie does not stem from Irons' portrayal; rather it stems from limitations in the script, which I'll explain in more detail below.3. The special effects in the film are really impressive. From the alien souls to the much-accelerated wound healing, the special effects are definitely one aspect of the film that cannot disappoint.4. The setting and the scenery in the film are phenomenal. Not only does the movie create an interesting and vivid look into the world of the Seekers and the Souls, but it also includes beautiful shots of the desert and, more importantly, the cave. The giant fields, hot springs, and especially the mirrors on the ceiling were perfect. The glow worms were a nice touch as well.5. Although physically much different than the seeker is described in the book, Diane Krueger does a great job bringing the relentless, spiteful seeker to life. (If you've read the book, you'll notice one drastic change in characterization toward the end of the film, but again, the fault cannot be placed on the actress, as it was scripted that way.)I think that the above reasons alone make the film worth watching. However, in the fairness of including a thorough review, I'd also like to point out the limitations.1. The characterization for certain key characters was a bit off. I mentioned about that I felt there were some limitations with the character of Jared. In the book he is rugged, a bit rough around the edges, but still funny. And he also cares fiercely about Melanie and Jamie. I feel like the movie reduced him to just the boyfriend who fiercely loves Melanie and wants her back; in just watching the movie, you don't get the full effect. The same can also be said of Ian, whose transformation from would-be-murderer to soul-sympathizer comes rather suddenly with little explanation in the movie.2. At times, the script seems a little stiff. It's not throughout the whole movie, just at certain points, but it still detracts a bit from the story.To sum up, the movie has a lot more positives than negatives. It is a well-made, compelling movie with a talented cast. I personally believe that the movie will be much more enjoyable if you read the book before watching the film. That way you'll be able to fully appreciate all the characters, even the ones whose personalities are not fully developed in the film. And I also recommend seeing it more than once. It's even better the second time around.",5,Read the Book First . . .,1367020800,"04 27, 2013",2013,3785,"['someone', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'prior', 'seeing', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Host', 'have', 'say', 'had', 'very', 'high', 'expectations', 'going', 'film', ""'m"", 'being', 'totally', 'honest', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'measure', 'up', 'incredible', 'world', 'created', 'pages', 'Meyer', 'novel', 'being', 'said', 'however', 'feel', 'imperative', 'also', 'point', 'out', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'novels', 'ALWAYS', 'come', 'limitations', 'impossible', 'fully', 'capture', 'everything', 'book', 'great', 'allotted', 'two-hour', 'timeframe', 'typical', 'movie', 'Host', 'was', 'certainly', 'exception', 'rule', 'Still', 'did', 'find', 'movie', 'be', 'entertaining', 'compelling', 'number', 'reasons', '*NOTE', 'Spoilers', 'ahead.*1', 'Saorise', 'Ronan', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'two', 'characters', 'trapped', 'same', 'body', 'accurately', 'Wanda', 'rigid', 'alien', 'way', 'speaking', 'as', 'well', 'throwing', 'slightly', 'southern-twinged', 'accent', 'Melanie', 'who', 'Louisiana', 'film', 'felt', 'was', 'strong', 'female', 'lead', 'film.2', 'Max', 'Irons', 'impressive', 'albeit', 'limited', 'performance', 'Jared', 'Howe', 'Irons', 'was', 'able', 'capture', 'struggle', 'hurt', 'Jared', 'caused', 'losing', 'Mel', 'then', 'having', 'body', 'return', 'soul', 'inside', 'convincingly', 'portray', 'emotions', 'on-screen', 'only', 'criticism', 'have', 'character', 'movie', 'not', 'stem', 'Irons', 'portrayal', 'rather', 'limitations', 'script', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'more', 'detail', 'below.3', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'are', 'really', 'impressive', 'alien', 'souls', 'much-accelerated', 'wound', 'healing', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'definitely', 'one', 'aspect', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'disappoint.4', 'setting', 'scenery', 'film', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'Not', 'only', 'movie', 'create', 'interesting', 'vivid', 'look', 'world', 'Seekers', 'Souls', 'also', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'desert', 'more', 'importantly', 'cave', 'giant', 'fields', 'hot', 'springs', 'especially', 'mirrors', 'ceiling', 'were', 'perfect', 'glow', 'worms', 'were', 'nice', 'touch', 'well.5', 'physically', 'much', 'different', 'seeker', 'described', 'book', 'Diane', 'Krueger', 'great', 'job', 'bringing', 'relentless', 'spiteful', 'seeker', 'life', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'one', 'drastic', 'change', 'characterization', 'end', 'film', 'again', 'fault', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'placed', 'actress', 'was', 'scripted', 'way', 'think', 'above', 'reasons', 'alone', 'make', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'However', 'fairness', 'including', 'thorough', 'review', ""'d"", 'also', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'limitations.1', 'characterization', 'certain', 'key', 'characters', 'was', 'bit', 'mentioned', 'felt', 'were', 'limitations', 'character', 'Jared', 'book', 'rugged', 'bit', 'rough', 'edges', 'still', 'funny', 'also', 'fiercely', 'Melanie', 'Jamie', 'feel', 'movie', 'reduced', 'just', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'fiercely', 'Melanie', 'back', 'just', 'watching', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'full', 'effect', 'same', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'said', 'Ian', 'transformation', 'would-be-murderer', 'soul-sympathizer', 'rather', 'suddenly', 'little', 'explanation', 'movie.2', 'times', 'script', 'little', 'stiff', 'not', 'whole', 'movie', 'just', 'certain', 'points', 'still', 'bit', 'story.To', 'sum', 'up', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'positives', 'negatives', 'well-made', 'compelling', 'movie', 'talented', 'cast', 'personally', 'believe', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'read', 'book', 'watching', 'film', 'way', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'characters', 'even', 'ones', 'personalities', 'are', 'not', 'fully', 'developed', 'film', 'also', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'more', 'once', 'even', 'better', 'second', 'time']",The Host

Most of the flaws that detracted from slightly from my enjoyment all came back to some things being rushed to fit the run time. Given the disappointing box office results, probably good that it wasn't split into two films, as we may never have seen the second half, but it would have been better if they could have made wise use of an additional 30 minutes to develop the key relationships.It's sort of sad that over the top Twilight hate seems to have had blowback on this film's reception, being based on a book by the same author.

1581320,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B0090SI4LU,FNDNreview,"[4, 8]","We're only months removed from the final installment of the Twilight series, and there's already another Stephenie Meyer film adaption hitting the big screen.  Obviously, Twilight has quite the large fan base, bringing in a combined total of more than $3 billion worldwide (not including the books) - so the question becomes:  can the first film adaption from Stephanie Meyer since the end of Twilight achieve even a silver of the same success enjoyed by the Twilight saga?  The term ""success"" is used loosely here, because even though the Twilight films did well at the box office, they're not exactly the most critically acclaimed films.  However, this newest film adaption, The Host, clearly doesn't have the same popularity as Twilight, so expectations should be tampered as far as the box office gross is concerned.Director Andrew Niccol (The Truman Show & In Time) brings Stephenie Meyer's newest fictional universe to life in The Host, starring Saoirse Ronan as Melanie/The Wanderer (aka Wanda), a member of the human resistance.  Aliens, called ""Souls,"" have invaded the earth and humans are forced to live a life in hiding or risk being mentally possessed by the parasitic life forms.  Melanie, her little brother, Jamie (Chandler Canterbury), and Melanie's lover, Jared (Max Irons), are on the run, but when the aliens find them, Melanie sacrifices herself to protect her brother, and is possessed by a soul called, ""The Wanderer.""  However, unlike other humans that are unable to mentally fight the aliens, Melanie's mind is strong enough to resist.  Now, Melanie and ""The Wanderer"" are forced to share the same mind, both of whom have very different ambitions.  After convincing Melanie's other inner half to meet up with the human resistance (Melanie's family), they must adapt to a life of inner turmoil, while being pursued by other ""souls,"" including ""The Seeker (Diane Kruger),"" - the leader of the anti-resistance.  Jake Able, Frances Fisher, William Hunt, and Boyd Holbrook also star in supporting roles.For those wondering, The Host is a lot like Twilight - only different.  Yes, that statement is a complete contradiction, but The Host and Twilight are nothing more than role reversal films.  Twilight focuses on two characters, Bella and Edward, whom are destined to be in love for eternity (or at least over the course of five films).  For the duration of the final Twilight films, the vampire ""issues"" play a role in the outcome of their relationship, but the relationship is the ultimate focus.  The premise of The Host focuses more on the alien presence issue and the inner turmoil of Melanie's character, with the intertwined love stories are a secondary plot point.  Instead of a Bella/Edward/Jacob love triangle, The Host features a Melanie/Jared and Wanda/Ian love triangle (foursome if you'd like to get technical about it) - obviously with the two female characters take up the same body.Now the question becomes:  does this film work as a means of film entertainment?  The short answer is yes, it works.  However, there are a series of soap opera-ish interactions that make the film feel overly drawn out.  In several scenes, Melanie carries on conversations with Wanda, which translate into a bunch of scenes where Saoirse Ronan is talking to herself.  Story-wise, it makes sense - but that still doesn't change the fact that there's too many scenes and too much time devoted to one character talking to one's self.  If she were stranded on a desert island, like Tom Hanks in Cast Away, it would be okay, but this film simply has too many scenes that feel like they could have easily been cut.  For instance, there's a scene where Melanie's personality disappears and the only way to bring her back is for Wanda to make out with two different guys.  Apparently, everyone gets a shot to make out with Saoirse in this lengthy film.As far as themes go in The Host - and even though they invaded earth - these aliens display admirable traits about the importance of being polite, nonviolent, and caring about one another.  They're all properly dressed in their perfectly white outfits, spotless automobiles, and to boot - they're always trusting, and never tell a lie.  At one point, Wanda even makes a comment that her species trusts one another and they're on earth to eliminate human flaws.  However, even though they obey these traits, that still doesn't stop the film's incredibly weakly written villain, ""The Seeker"" from experimenting with a gun - killing one of her own alien associates in the process.Overall, this is Saoirse Ronan's film from beginning to end.  However, there's nothing special about the way her character is written, but it's clearly evident that she has a knack for the lead role.  Unfortunately, The Host lacks Twilight's attention-drawing action scenes, causing the film to drag on.  Too much dull banter and a less than memorable love story puts this film squarely in the ""one and done"" column.Overall Film Grade:  C-FNDNreview.com",2,'Twilight' reworked as 'The

Just the idea of benign extra-terrestrials who aren't intent on killing and destroying is a little used tool and gets lost in the shuffle of aliens that always wants to destroy. Maybe the people are left without their own personality, but they were given a free benign life. I was very excited that at least one human was able to overcome their hold on them and that humans could even change the aliens and blend their lives for the benefit of all. The movie left out a lot of relevant episodes from the book, but this version of the movie was adequate.

Stuff happens, lotsof staring and talking to herself and she winds up befriending a group of ""resistance fighters"". More staring and Vangelis-type music,and then there is a romantic triangle between the girl and two guys ZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz......The Host is not just boring, its unrealistic, even for a science *gag* fiction film.Do you really think Beau and Zeke would hide in a mountain, growing wheatduring an invasion by glowy-eyed, pacifist aliens? Finding new ways to grill them Cajun-style maybe.Everybody in this film acted like they were on Prozac. John Hurt plays the leader of the resistance.

Also known as ""La hu&eacute;sped,"" this story is based on the novel by Stephanie Meyer (""Twilight"") so this PG-13 film should be a crowd pleaser. My problem was with the 3M dialogue: Murmur; Mutter; and Mumble (I missed 50% of what they said). The screenplay, by Andrew Niccol (""In Time"") who also directed, confused me: I honestly couldn't tell when it was intentionally humorous or just plain laughable. I WILL say our screening audience laughed many, many times.We start with a young woman so desperate to save her younger brother's life from ""peaceful"" alien invaders she makes a suicidal leap out a window but is soon restored to life by those same despicable beings. From then on, she has the icy blue eyes which tell us that she too, is one of ""them."" Problem is, the survivalist human she replaced has survived...as a pesky voice inside her head. Thus the humor.I appreciate that all the men in the survivalist community are twenty-ish hunks, each with one good reason or another to be attracted to our heroine. Hey...It's Stephanie Meyer!Here we have:* Saoirse Ronan (""Atonement"") is Melanie/Wanda, both with distinct personalities, vying for control. As Melanie she was in love with Jared, but that doesn't stop Wanda from falling for Ian. Got that straight?* Max Irons (""Red Riding Hood"") Yeah! ...Okay, so Jared is another survivalist; he lived with our heroine and her younger brother in a derelict mobile home before the aliens started imposing their peaceful ways on the planet.* Jake Abel (""I Am Number Four"") is Ian, who falls for the alien Wanda with poor Melanie shouting her dismay from inside Wanda's head.* Chandler Canterbury (""Repo Men"") is indispensable as little brother Jamie who is the first to sort out where the spirit of his missing sister might be lurking.* Diane Kruger (""Inglorious Basterds"") is relentless as The Seeker. She WILL capture that missing girl even if she has to resort to violence to do it! (...gasp...)* William Hurt (""Robin Hood"" 2010) as Jeb, is the paterfamilias of a group of survivalist wheat farmers. Their field is hidden inside a mountain...trust me. He keeps the peace with a loaded shotgun.* Marcus Lyle Brown (Lots of TV) His Healer Fords is the medical man who lives with the survivalists and tries to help our heroine.At least the aliens are easy to spot: their various means of travel (a Ford Lotus, some motorcycles and a few helicopters) are all bright silver. Expect some gunfire, a little vehicular mayhem, no profanity, no sweaty bodies and no blowie uppie stuff. In addition, this movie passes the Bechdel Test because the women talk about the issues at hand, not about a man.The message is: ""Love conquers all,"" so look for a happy ending AND a theater with closed captions!

1581363,A2Z3643FSM4PAQ,B0090SI4LU,Joe Smart,"[0, 1]","I'm not the target for The Host since a) I'm not a girl and b) I haven't been a young adult since Ronald Reagan was president c) I'm not a fan of the Twilight series and finally d) I've never liked any film made by writer director Andrew Niccol.  So I think it's understandable that I'm a little bit ashamed at how much I liked this movie.  What could elevate a movie with so much going against it?  Two words--Saoirse Ronan, who with this and Byzantium is quickly turning into one of my favorite actresses.  Ronan plays a girl whose body is taken over by a parasitic being as part of an alien invasion of the earth.  The alien and human end up liking each other and the alien (who physically controls the body) runs away to save the human girl and prevent her superiors from implanting her into a more compliant body.  Roman spends almost the entire movie arguing with herself in voice-over as the alien and human communicate constantly inside the girl's head.  It shouldn't work and with nearly anyone else in the lead it wouldn't but somehow Ronan manages to create two distinct, very likable characters.  The Host also has the distinction of featuring one of the strangest love triangles in YA lit history as the human girl and alien (who share the same body) fall in love with two different young men.  Beyond Saoirse Ronan The Host's chief pleasure are in the film's clean, shiny production design (always a strength in Andrew Niccol films--he's a consummate stylist, even if he usually gets very little else right) and effective performances from William Hurt as Ronan's kindly uncle and Diane Kruger as the villain, an alien intent on wiping out the remaining pockets of the human race.  Plotting wise this is about as corny as you would expect from a Stephanie Meyers adaptation but Saoirse Roman cuts through the general silliness and really makes you care about what happens to her human and alien characters.  If this had starred Kristen Stewart (Bella from Twilight) it would have been completely unwatchable--she can barely play one character, let alone two, but Saoirse Ronan, through sheer force of talent or will makes The Host worth seeing, if not quite a must see.  It's too bad The Host flopped in theaters but hopefully it will find an audience on video.",4,Guilty pleasure,1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,2275,"[""'m"", 'not', 'target', 'Host', ""'m"", 'not', 'girl', 'b', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'young', 'adult', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'was', 'president', 'c', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Twilight', 'series', 'finally', 'd', ""'ve"", 'never', 'liked', 'film', 'made', 'writer', 'director', 'Andrew', 'Niccol', 'So', 'think', 'understandable', ""'m"", 'little', 'bit', 'ashamed', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'movie', 'What', 'could', 'elevate', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'Two', 'words', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'who', 'Byzantium', 'quickly', 'turning', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'Ronan', 'girl', 'body', 'taken', 'over', 'parasitic', 'being', 'part', 'alien', 'invasion', 'earth', 'alien', 'human', 'end', 'up', 'liking', 'other', 'alien', 'who', 'physically', 'body', 'away', 'save', 'human', 'girl', 'prevent', 'superiors', 'implanting', 'more', 'compliant', 'body', 'Roman', 'almost', 'entire', 'movie', 'arguing', 'voice-over', 'alien', 'human', 'communicate', 'constantly', 'girl', 'head', 'should', ""n't"", 'work', 'nearly', 'anyone', 'else', 'lead', 'would', ""n't"", 'somehow', 'Ronan', 'create', 'two', 'distinct', 'very', 'likable', 'characters', 'Host', 'also', 'distinction', 'featuring', 'one', 'strangest', 'love', 'triangles', 'YA', 'lit', 'history', 'human', 'girl', 'alien', 'who', 'share', 'same', 'body', 'fall', 'love', 'two', 'different', 'young', 'men', 'Beyond', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'Host', 'chief', 'pleasure', 'are', 'film', 'clean', 'shiny', 'production', 'design', 'always', 'strength', 'Andrew', 'Niccol', 'films', 'consummate', 'stylist', 'even', 'usually', 'very', 'little', 'else', 'right', 'effective', 'performances', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Ronan', 'kindly', 'uncle', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'villain', 'alien', 'intent', 'wiping', 'out', 'remaining', 'pockets', 'human', 'race', 'Plotting', 'wise', 'about', 'as', 'corny', 'would', 'expect', 'Stephanie', 'Meyers', 'adaptation', 'Saoirse', 'Roman', 'general', 'silliness', 'really', 'care', 'what', 'human', 'alien', 'characters', 'had', 'starred', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Bella', 'Twilight', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'unwatchable', 'can', 'barely', 'play', 'one', 'character', 'let', 'alone', 'two', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'sheer', 'force', 'talent', 'will', 'Host', 'worth', 'seeing', 'not', 'must', 'see', 'too', 'bad', 'Host', 'flopped', 'theaters', 'hopefully', 'will', 'find', 'audience', 'video']",The Host

1581367,A1L5WAZAL5H1SA,B0090SI4LU,Jon (Scott Reads It!),"[2, 6]","How do you turn a 619 page bestseller into a movie? Andrew Niccol had the challenge of directing the adaptation of Stephenie Meyer's The Host. I have been a huge fan of The Host since I read it in May 2012 and I had such high expectations for this movie. I was pretty disappointed with the film adaptation of The Host.The Host starts off with a bang and immediately takes viewers into the complex world of the Souls and Hosts. Saoirse Ronan is a rebel named Melanie who gets captured by the Souls and she becomes a Host to Wanderer (Wanda). Wanda's job is to find Melanie's brother (Chandler Canterbury) and Melanie's boyfriend, Jared (Max Irons). Wanda is not prepared for the troubles of being human. Wanda meets up with Jamie and Jared but not everyone is happy to see her. Ian (Jake Abel) soons become entangled in Melanie's life.The Host is pretty true to it's source material, there are only a few differences between the novel and movie. The problem is not with the concept of the movie but how The Host is executed. I feel like the cast members of The Host lacked passion for their characters.A majority of the acting in The Host lacks the raw and powerful emotion found in the novel. Saoirse Ronan does a decent job at playing both Melanie and Wanda. I didn't really feel any empathy toward Melanie and Wanda when I saw the movie. When I read The Host, both characters really struck a chord with me emotionally. Both love interests Jared and Ian weren't exactly convincing in portraying their characters. I didn't feel like Ronan had any chemistry with Irons or Abel, the romance just didn't feel existent. Sure, Ronan kept locking lips with Irons and Abel but I didn't think their characters true felt any love towards each other.I think the most exceptional performances are carried out by Diane Kruger and William Hurt. Kruger's portrayal of The Seeker was extremely terrifying and powerful. Every single time I saw Kruger character, I was ready for a fabulous performance. William Hurt was the best choice for Jeb and his portrayal of Jeb was simply perfect. Hurt shows so many different angles of his character and his performance truly captured the essence of Jeb's character.Plotwise The Host moves at a ridiculously slow pace and I think the movie should have been edited better. The transitions between each scene were not smooth and were a bit on the awkward side. The Host is about what it means to be human and yet this message seemed to be lost in this adaptation. There was none of the powerful messages and motifs that I remember reading about it Meyer's novel.Also lost in translation to the big screen was Jared and Ian. Jared and Ian were huge parts of the novel and yet in the movie they didn't feel so significant. The ""love box"" (4 love interests) felt extremely fake because the viewer can't connect with any of the main characters. Jake Abel's performance is extremely unconvincing, he transitions almost instantaneously from wanting to kill Wanda to falling for her. I expected to see Abel slowly fall in love with Wanda but this was not the case. The dialogues between Wanda and Jared and Wanda and Ian were extremely memorable in the novel. This movie adaptation doesn't feature 95% of my favorite quotes from the novel.I seem to focus on what I didn't like but there were many things I really liked about The Host. I loved the way all of the futuristic technology was shown in The Host. Also all of the action scenes were extremely intense and well done.  I would love to see more of the action scenes because I really enjoyed watching them.It was interesting to see how the makers of The Host's interpretation of Souls. Though I complained about the acting in this film, the acting wasn't terrible.The Host is a mediocre movie ruined by unconvincing acting, an extremely slow pace, and badly written script. While watching The Host I was extremely antsy and I feel like this movie could have been a half hour shorter. I know all of the cast members have expressed interests in making The Host a franchise. I would definitely see a sequel but I would probably wait till it gets released on DVD.  I think I would have enjoyed this movie more if I hadn't read the novel. The novel is far better than the movie and I would recommending reading the book instead. The Host wasn't the worst movie I have seen but it certainly wasn't the best.",2,Disappointing,1368403200,"05 13, 2013",2013,4372,"['How', 'do', 'turn', '619', 'page', 'bestseller', 'movie', 'Andrew', 'Niccol', 'had', 'challenge', 'directing', 'adaptation', 'Stephenie', 'Meyer', 'Host', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Host', 'read', 'May', '2012', 'had', 'such', 'high', 'expectations', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'disappointed', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Host.The', 'Host', 'bang', 'immediately', 'viewers', 'complex', 'world', 'Souls', 'Hosts', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'rebel', 'named', 'Melanie', 'who', 'captured', 'Souls', 'Host', 'Wanderer', 'Wanda', 'Wanda', 'job', 'find', 'Melanie', 'brother', 'Chandler', 'Canterbury', 'Melanie', 'boyfriend', 'Jared', 'Max', 'Irons', 'Wanda', 'not', 'prepared', 'troubles', 'being', 'human', 'Wanda', 'up', 'Jamie', 'Jared', 'not', 'everyone', 'happy', 'see', 'Ian', 'Jake', 'Abel', 'become', 'entangled', 'Melanie', 'life.The', 'Host', 'pretty', 'true', 'source', 'material', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'differences', 'novel', 'movie', 'problem', 'not', 'concept', 'movie', 'how', 'Host', 'executed', 'feel', 'cast', 'members', 'Host', 'lacked', 'passion', 'characters.A', 'majority', 'acting', 'Host', 'raw', 'powerful', 'emotion', 'found', 'novel', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'decent', 'job', 'playing', 'Melanie', 'Wanda', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'empathy', 'Melanie', 'Wanda', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'When', 'read', 'Host', 'characters', 'really', 'struck', 'chord', 'emotionally', 'love', 'interests', 'Jared', 'Ian', 'were', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'convincing', 'portraying', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Ronan', 'had', 'chemistry', 'Irons', 'Abel', 'romance', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'existent', 'Sure', 'Ronan', 'kept', 'locking', 'lips', 'Irons', 'Abel', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'characters', 'true', 'felt', 'love', 'towards', 'other.I', 'think', 'most', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'are', 'carried', 'out', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Kruger', 'portrayal', 'Seeker', 'was', 'extremely', 'terrifying', 'powerful', 'single', 'time', 'saw', 'Kruger', 'character', 'was', 'ready', 'fabulous', 'performance', 'William', 'Hurt', 'was', 'best', 'choice', 'Jeb', 'portrayal', 'Jeb', 'was', 'simply', 'perfect', 'Hurt', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'angles', 'character', 'performance', 'truly', 'captured', 'essence', 'Jeb', 'character.Plotwise', 'Host', 'moves', 'ridiculously', 'slow', 'pace', 'think', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'better', 'transitions', 'scene', 'were', 'not', 'smooth', 'were', 'bit', 'awkward', 'side', 'Host', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'yet', 'message', 'seemed', 'be', 'lost', 'adaptation', 'was', 'none', 'powerful', 'messages', 'motifs', 'remember', 'reading', 'Meyer', 'novel.Also', 'lost', 'translation', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'Jared', 'Ian', 'Jared', 'Ian', 'were', 'huge', 'parts', 'novel', 'yet', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'so', 'significant', 'love', 'box', '4', 'love', 'interests', 'felt', 'extremely', 'fake', 'viewer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'connect', 'main', 'characters', 'Jake', 'Abel', 'performance', 'extremely', 'unconvincing', 'almost', 'instantaneously', 'wanting', 'kill', 'Wanda', 'falling', 'expected', 'see', 'Abel', 'slowly', 'fall', 'love', 'Wanda', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'dialogues', 'Wanda', 'Jared', 'Wanda', 'Ian', 'were', 'extremely', 'memorable', 'novel', 'movie', 'adaptation', ""n't"", 'feature', '95', '%', 'favorite', 'quotes', 'novel.I', 'seem', 'focus', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'were', 'many', 'things', 'really', 'liked', 'Host', 'loved', 'way', 'futuristic', 'technology', 'was', 'shown', 'Host', 'Also', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'extremely', 'intense', 'well', 'done', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'more', 'action', 'scenes', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'them.It', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'makers', 'Host', 'interpretation', 'Souls', 'complained', 'acting', 'film', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible.The', 'Host', 'mediocre', 'movie', 'ruined', 'unconvincing', 'acting', 'extremely', 'slow', 'pace', 'badly', 'written', 'script', 'watching', 'Host', 'was', 'extremely', 'antsy', 'feel', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'half', 'hour', 'shorter', 'know', 'cast', 'members', 'have', 'expressed', 'interests', 'making', 'Host', 'franchise', 'would', 'definitely', 'see', 'sequel', 'would', 'probably', 'wait', 'till', 'released', 'DVD', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'more', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'novel', 'novel', 'far', 'better', 'movie', 'would', 'recommending', 'reading', 'book', 'instead', 'Host', 'was', ""n't"", 'worst', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'best']",The Host

Melanie fights for her body against an alien know as the wanderer.When I originally saw the trailer for this, I thought that this had an interesting concept for a plot line and if done the right way, would be great. I am not familiar with the original book on which this is based, so I don't know how far it is off there but that is not the problem with the movie.But after watching the movie to me, this seemed like a low budget version of Twilight or a movie idea that should have been a mini-series or a TV series idea that they decided to make as a movie. And although this may appeal to those fans of the Twilight series and those in that demographic, the talking in your head concept of alien takeover just didn't translate well to me on the big screen. It seemed a muddled mess that had long stretches of nothing going on except unbelievable behavior and romances by the characters. Sci-fi doesn't have to be all action but at least give me some type of action. 90 percent of the movie is set in a cave in the desert where amazingly the most exciting thing going on is the wheat being grown there. The acting and character interaction was almost as bad as the movie concept.If done a different way, this movie had a lot of promise, unfortunately the way they brought this to the big screen, just didn't translate to me.

1581380,A11L3YX5WIDKJ,B0090SI4LU,Kelli of I'd So Rather Be Reading,"[0, 0]","Stephenie Meyer's The Host is one of my all-time favorite books.  I've read it several times and each time I enjoy it just as much as the first time I read the book, right after it was released in 2008.  I've long hoped that Meyer would release a sequel to The Host (has she decided to just stop writing and work on movies?!) but in lieu of a new book release, I was pacified with the release of The Host movie.I did not see The Host in the theater; the main reason being that I'm a SAHM to a 2 year old and I really can't get to the movies anymore.  As soon as the movie was released on Netflix, I sat down and watched it.While I don't think the movie version of a book is ever as good as the book itself, I found the disparity between the book and movie versions of The Host to be quite shocking.  The movie felt flat, unemotional, and cliched to me.  Many of the more emotional scenes in the book were either missing, contrived, or rushed.  The movie seemed to drag and was, at times, boring.  In contrast, I think the book is exciting, full of emotion, and I love the slow build of the relationships between the characters.  The movie was full of what I consider typical alien cliches: very sleek, advanced technology, white and gray clothes, bright and modern silver cars, etc.  I wish that the souls' technology would have been more subtle (as it was implied in the book) and not so abjectly alien.There was a definite lack of chemistry between the main characters.  If I had not read the book, I would have been unsure as to why Ian and Wanda ever fell in love.  The relationship building was just not there.  At one point, Wanda/Melanie asks Jared to kiss her.  That part in the book was so full of chemistry.  In the movie, it was laughably forced.I have mixed emotions about the casting for The Host.  I thought Jeb, Jared, Maggie and the Seeker/Lacey were perfectly cast.  I also liked Melanie; however, I wish she would have been stronger-looking.  She's so thin and I always imagined Melanie to have a fighter's build, not a super-slim actress build with very light musculature.  Wanda's character was my biggest casting complaint.  Wanda is supposed to be small, ethereally beautiful, blonde, and delicate.  Wanda's new body was just all wrong (the wrong face, hair, and stature), and it nearly ruined the ending of the movie for me.My favorite character was the Seeker.  She perfectly embodied the Seeker from the book, and I loved her internal struggle, and the fact that she's hiding a huge secret of her own.  Her drive and determination were admirable, although poorly directed, and I loved the way her storyline came to a close.The best thing I can say about The Host movie is that it did stay true to the book.  I really appreciate that and liked seeing one of my favorite books adapted into a movie.  I wish that the movie had been longer, to allow for more character development.  There were some important plot points that were left out, due to time constraints, I'm guessing.  The storyline about Kyle and Jodi, as well as Wanda's job before she meets up with Jeb, immediately come to mind.I realize that this review is full of complaints.  I did enjoy the movie, but had some major problems with it.  I know it's not a movie I'll buy, or likely ever watch again.  It may be worth your time if you can rent it for a low price, but I would highly recommend reading the book instead if you have the time.",3,"A disappointment compared to the book, full of cliches, and a lack of chemistry",1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,3427,"['Stephenie', 'Meyer', 'Host', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'books', ""'ve"", 'read', 'several', 'times', 'time', 'enjoy', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'first', 'time', 'read', 'book', 'right', 'was', 'released', '2008', ""'ve"", 'long', 'hoped', 'Meyer', 'would', 'release', 'sequel', 'Host', 'decided', 'just', 'stop', 'writing', 'work', 'movies', 'lieu', 'new', 'book', 'release', 'was', 'pacified', 'release', 'Host', 'movie.I', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'Host', 'theater', 'main', 'reason', 'being', ""'m"", 'SAHM', '2', 'year', 'old', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'movies', 'anymore', 'As', 'soon', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'Netflix', 'sat', 'down', 'watched', 'it.While', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'version', 'book', 'ever', 'as', 'good', 'book', 'found', 'disparity', 'book', 'movie', 'versions', 'Host', 'be', 'quite', 'shocking', 'movie', 'felt', 'flat', 'unemotional', 'cliched', 'Many', 'more', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'book', 'were', 'either', 'missing', 'contrived', 'rushed', 'movie', 'seemed', 'drag', 'was', 'times', 'boring', 'contrast', 'think', 'book', 'exciting', 'full', 'emotion', 'love', 'slow', 'build', 'relationships', 'characters', 'movie', 'was', 'full', 'what', 'consider', 'typical', 'alien', 'cliches', 'very', 'sleek', 'advanced', 'technology', 'white', 'gray', 'clothes', 'bright', 'modern', 'silver', 'cars', 'etc', 'wish', 'souls', 'technology', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'subtle', 'was', 'implied', 'book', 'not', 'so', 'abjectly', 'alien.There', 'was', 'definite', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'main', 'characters', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'unsure', 'why', 'Ian', 'Wanda', 'ever', 'fell', 'love', 'relationship', 'building', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'there', 'one', 'point', 'Wanda/Melanie', 'Jared', 'kiss', 'part', 'book', 'was', 'so', 'full', 'chemistry', 'movie', 'was', 'laughably', 'forced.I', 'have', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'casting', 'Host', 'thought', 'Jeb', 'Jared', 'Maggie', 'Seeker/Lacey', 'were', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'also', 'liked', 'Melanie', 'however', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'stronger-looking', 'so', 'thin', 'always', 'imagined', 'Melanie', 'have', 'fighter', 'build', 'not', 'super-slim', 'actress', 'build', 'very', 'light', 'musculature', 'Wanda', 'character', 'was', 'biggest', 'casting', 'complaint', 'Wanda', 'supposed', 'be', 'small', 'ethereally', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'delicate', 'Wanda', 'new', 'body', 'was', 'just', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'face', 'hair', 'stature', 'nearly', 'ruined', 'ending', 'movie', 'me.My', 'favorite', 'character', 'was', 'Seeker', 'perfectly', 'embodied', 'Seeker', 'book', 'loved', 'internal', 'struggle', 'fact', 'hiding', 'huge', 'secret', 'own', 'drive', 'determination', 'were', 'admirable', 'poorly', 'directed', 'loved', 'way', 'storyline', 'came', 'close.The', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'Host', 'movie', 'did', 'stay', 'true', 'book', 'really', 'appreciate', 'liked', 'seeing', 'one', 'favorite', 'books', 'adapted', 'movie', 'wish', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'longer', 'allow', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'were', 'important', 'plot', 'points', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'due', 'time', 'constraints', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'storyline', 'Kyle', 'Jodi', 'as', 'well', 'Wanda', 'job', 'up', 'Jeb', 'immediately', 'come', 'mind.I', 'realize', 'review', 'full', 'complaints', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'had', 'major', 'problems', 'know', 'not', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'likely', 'ever', 'watch', 'again', 'may', 'be', 'time', 'can', 'rent', 'low', 'price', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'reading', 'book', 'instead', 'have', 'time']",The Host

1581415,A3U3BEZMH3F01Q,B0090SI4LU,maskirovka,"[147, 178]","First, let me say, I'm not a ""Twi-hard.""  I don't have any interest in sparkly vampires and ripped werewolves.  And as a heterosexual male who is not a teenager, that's not too surprising.  But I did really love the novel ""the Host.""  For me, the concept is sort of like ""Dances with Wolves"" or ""Avatar.""  But instead of having a human run off to live with giant blue smurfs, here we have a protagonist who is truly alien and learns to become human.I think there are three problems with the film:1.  The thing that almost sunk the movie for me was the way the character of Melanie Stryder was manifested in Wanda's head.  I didn't mind the use of voice-overs, but I did mind the way that ""Melanie"" came across...sometimes, she sounded like a petulant 14 year-old and not the 20 year-old woman she was in the story.  When Saoirse Ronan was in Wanda mode, I found her mostly more convincing and otherworldly (although near the end, she started sounding like a typical human girl with weird contact lenses in her eyes instead of an alien being that had lived multiple lifetimes in different bodies over a thousand years).I really do wonder if it would have been a smarter thing to have cast an older actress in the role (perhaps if Jennifer Lawrence had been free she could have done it better).  I think Ronan is a beautiful woman and she's definitely talented as an actress but as I said, when she was in ""jealous Melanie"" mode, she came across as very young...and not particularly likeable.It also would have been smart to minimize the internal dialogue as much as possible and convey a lot of it with just Ronan's expressions and flashbacks.2.  The length of the novel (600 pages) really was important to sell the development of the character of Wanda/Wanderer...specifically, how she comes to love being human more than being a Soul and how she developed feelings for the character of Ian and how she also came to love Jared.  But the need to compress the story into something that is movie length (about two hours) resulted in a lot of the ""depth"" of the story falling by the wayside.  For example, we see Ian and Wanda ""fall in love"" but it seems mechanical and formulaic in the movie as opposed to touching as it was in the book.  Perhaps they should have split it into two films.&lt;spoilers>Even worse, when Wanda decides she wanted to give Melanie back her body and die, the movie will leave anyone who hasn't read the book scratching their heads as to why she would make a crazy decision like that.  In the book, Meyer set the stage for that intention by showing how much Wanda blamed herself for the death of one of her human friends, Wes, and how guilty she felt over the Souls displacing the human race (which set up the death of another one of her friends, Walt, who is missing from the movie, who died an agonizing death in front of her due to cancer).&lt;end spoilers>3.  Another thing that fell by the wayside that was key to the book being so compelling is that it was told by Wanda using ""first person narrative.""  You really got insight into how Wanda was becoming human and how she came to care for the humans she was prisoner of.This said, the movie was worth seeing and some of the reasons why included:1.  Saoirse Ronan's ""Wanda"" most of the time did capture the ""alien"" nature of the personality that was in Melanie Stryder's body.2.  William Hurt did a good job playing Uncle Jeb.  I was a little surprised that Hurt, who I best associate with ""Children of a Lesser God"" and ""the Accidental Tourist"" did so well playing the grizzled Jeb.3.  The ""world building"" (i.e. bringing the sort of strange post-apocalyptic world of the ""Souls"" to life) was pretty good and really did call to mind what I read in the book. The cave complex was particularly impressive.4.  Diane Krueger did a good job playing Wanda's pursuer.&lt;spoilers>5.  Emily Browning seemed to be well-cast as the new ""host"" for Wanda's personae.&lt;end spoilers>So to sum up, I thought ""the Host"" was worth seeing since I loved the novel so much.  I know I will read any sequel Meyer writes, and I probably will watch the movie sequels sort of curiosity to see how they bring any future novels to life.I figure at the very least, we won't see Saoirse Ronan arguing with herself in those films.",3,"The book was definitely better, MUCH better (spoilers)",1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,4282,"['First', 'let', 'say', ""'m"", 'not', 'Twi-hard', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'interest', 'sparkly', 'vampires', 'ripped', 'werewolves', 'heterosexual', 'male', 'who', 'not', 'teenager', 'not', 'too', 'surprising', 'did', 'really', 'love', 'novel', 'Host', 'concept', 'sort', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Avatar', 'instead', 'having', 'human', 'run', 'live', 'giant', 'blue', 'smurfs', 'here', 'have', 'protagonist', 'who', 'truly', 'alien', 'become', 'human.I', 'think', 'are', 'three', 'problems', 'film:1', 'thing', 'almost', 'sunk', 'movie', 'was', 'way', 'character', 'Melanie', 'Stryder', 'was', 'manifested', 'Wanda', 'head', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'use', 'voice-overs', 'did', 'mind', 'way', 'Melanie', 'came', 'sometimes', 'sounded', 'petulant', '14', 'year-old', 'not', '20', 'year-old', 'woman', 'was', 'story', 'When', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'was', 'Wanda', 'mode', 'found', 'mostly', 'more', 'convincing', 'otherworldly', 'end', 'started', 'sounding', 'typical', 'human', 'girl', 'weird', 'contact', 'eyes', 'instead', 'alien', 'being', 'had', 'lived', 'multiple', 'lifetimes', 'different', 'bodies', 'thousand', 'years', '.I', 'really', 'do', 'wonder', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'smarter', 'thing', 'have', 'cast', 'older', 'actress', 'role', 'perhaps', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'had', 'been', 'free', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'think', 'Ronan', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'definitely', 'talented', 'actress', 'said', 'when', 'was', 'jealous', 'Melanie', 'mode', 'came', 'very', 'young', 'not', 'particularly', 'likeable.It', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'smart', 'minimize', 'internal', 'dialogue', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'convey', 'lot', 'just', 'Ronan', 'expressions', 'flashbacks.2', 'length', 'novel', '600', 'pages', 'really', 'was', 'important', 'sell', 'development', 'character', 'Wanda/Wanderer', 'specifically', 'how', 'love', 'being', 'more', 'being', 'Soul', 'how', 'developed', 'feelings', 'character', 'Ian', 'how', 'also', 'came', 'love', 'Jared', 'need', 'compress', 'story', 'something', 'movie', 'length', 'two', 'hours', 'resulted', 'lot', 'depth', 'story', 'falling', 'wayside', 'example', 'see', 'Ian', 'Wanda', 'fall', 'love', 'mechanical', 'formulaic', 'movie', 'opposed', 'touching', 'was', 'book', 'Perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'split', 'two', 'films.', 'lt', 'spoilers', '>', 'Even', 'worse', 'when', 'Wanda', 'wanted', 'give', 'Melanie', 'back', 'body', 'die', 'movie', 'will', 'leave', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'scratching', 'heads', 'why', 'would', 'make', 'crazy', 'decision', 'book', 'Meyer', 'set', 'stage', 'intention', 'showing', 'how', 'much', 'Wanda', 'blamed', 'death', 'one', 'human', 'friends', 'Wes', 'how', 'guilty', 'felt', 'Souls', 'displacing', 'human', 'race', 'set', 'up', 'death', 'one', 'friends', 'Walt', 'who', 'missing', 'movie', 'who', 'died', 'agonizing', 'death', 'front', 'due', 'cancer', 'lt', 'end', 'spoilers', '>', '3', 'thing', 'fell', 'wayside', 'was', 'key', 'book', 'being', 'so', 'compelling', 'was', 'told', 'Wanda', 'using', 'first', 'person', 'narrative', 'really', 'got', 'insight', 'how', 'Wanda', 'was', 'becoming', 'human', 'how', 'came', 'care', 'humans', 'was', 'prisoner', 'of.This', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'worth', 'seeing', 'reasons', 'why', 'included:1', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'Wanda', 'most', 'time', 'did', 'capture', 'alien', 'nature', 'personality', 'was', 'Melanie', 'Stryder', 'body.2', 'William', 'Hurt', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'Uncle', 'Jeb', 'was', 'little', 'surprised', 'Hurt', 'who', 'best', 'associate', 'Children', 'Lesser', 'God', 'Accidental', 'Tourist', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'playing', 'grizzled', 'Jeb.3', 'world', 'building', 'i.e', 'bringing', 'sort', 'strange', 'post-apocalyptic', 'world', 'Souls', 'life', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'really', 'did', 'call', 'mind', 'what', 'read', 'book', 'cave', 'complex', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressive.4', 'Diane', 'Krueger', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'Wanda', 'pursuer.', 'lt', 'spoilers', '>', '5', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'seemed', 'be', 'well-cast', 'new', 'host', 'Wanda', 'personae.', 'lt', 'end', 'spoilers', '>', 'So', 'sum', 'up', 'thought', 'Host', 'was', 'worth', 'seeing', 'loved', 'novel', 'so', 'much', 'know', 'will', 'read', 'sequel', 'Meyer', 'probably', 'will', 'watch', 'movie', 'sort', 'curiosity', 'see', 'how', 'bring', 'future', 'novels', 'life.I', 'figure', 'very', 'least', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'arguing', 'films']",The Host

Or, could it be that I see so much drama around me everyday, that watching this teenage romance novel on screen is a short escape from reality?Either way, I mostly liked, if not enjoyed the movie.""The Host"" is a slow flowing book, aimed primarily at teenage girls aged 14-19. The movie catches this flow quite nicely. Just like the book, it starts slow and stays that way till the very end. This is NOT and action flick.The scenery is close to the description. I liked the acting by the entire cast, especially Saoirse Ronan and Jake Abel. William Hurt delivers a nice performance (as usual) and fits the part nicely.As a rule, I don't like seeing books on screen. There is an inevitable change of storyline and a loss of characters from the book who are deemed unnecessary to the plot. That, however, doesn't bother me as much as the all-to-often deviation in the characters' physical appearances when compared to the book.What I really didn't like (I'm a stickler for details like this),and this is where the physical appearance of the actor completely deviates from the book, is the choice of Diane Kruger for the role of the Seeker Lacey and Emily Browning for the part of Pat/Wonderer. The total lack of the character ""Jody"" also take something away, although not to noticeably.Diane Kruger is a fine, very attractive actress, but she is a 5'11"" blond, dressed in all white. In the book the ""seeker"" is described as a very petite brunette who wares all blackPat is described as a tiny, very frail 16 year old with tons of freckles everywhere. She look like someone you just have to protect.  Mrs Browning is average height, in her mid 20's and relatively wholesome looking.Futuristic scenery of the cities, cars and motorcycles is pretty believable.

This is the heart and the core of the book. If you fail at this, the movie is dead in the water. In the movie Melanie was demanding, harsh and NEVER shuts up. She also in control a lot. In the book that isn't the case. She has an option and when Wanda does something she doesn't agree with she speaks up, but Wanda for the most part ignores her and other then that she stays pretty quite, expect with Jared and Ian. In the book Melanie is feisty and strong willed. Not a total bitch. They also have a strong bond. so when Melanie comes to the conclusion that she wants give her back her body, you not left with the question, ""Why is Melanie fighting this?""Reason number two the movie has failed: Miscast of the minor characters. I feel like with the exception of Jeb, Melanie/Wanda, Jared and Ian...everyone else was miscast. The worst had to be Doc and BurnsReason number three this movie failed: The awesome little details were all left out. This movie was rushed. Because it was rush all the little details were left out. The thing the suffered the worst from all these lack of details were the relationships with everyone. Aunt Maggie and Sharon were barley seen, It's hard to understand why Ian fell for Wanda, the relationship between Jared and Wanda is just confusing and Doc is completely left out, so it doesn't make sense when he lies for her later on in the book. Some important characters were also left out. Like Walter, a dying man who becomes Wanda's first real friend, and first real lost and Sunny, another soul who was in Kyle's girlfriends body.Overall, I'm shocked that Meyer's screwed up her own book into movie so bad. Maybe she should have left this to the pros? I know that there were budget concerns. I agree that THIS is the movie that needed to be spilt up into two movie, NOT BREAKING DAWN.

1581433,A1NIC6Z33PSMYX,B0090SI4LU,Modern Girl,"[0, 0]","As many might know, this movie was based on the novel written by Stephenie Meyer. While I have some mixed feelings regarding the movie adaptation, for the most part, I have a favorable outlook on the movie as a whole.PROS:1) Casting - I felt like the casting was superb.  Ronan did an excellent job of portraying an alien trapped in a human host.  I sensed the same kind of ""spunk"" in Melanie through her voice-overs as I did in the novel.  Some might say that she sounded like a brat, but let's be real here... if their body got taken over by some alien after spending years evading the aliens and trying to protect your loved ones, wouldn't you be a p!ssed off too? :-) Ronan's acting also told the story of how conflicted Wanda had become after taking over her host's body.  Uncle Jeb, Maggie, Ian and Jared were also cast well.  If you compare the novel's descriptions to the movie, some of the characters were changed slightly, but I found that the changes were for the better.  The Seeker, Wanda's new host body, and a few others were described differently, but I didn't think that took away from the movie.2) I liked the movie structure.  While most of it was seen from Wanda's POV, there were some cut-overs to show what the Seeker and some of the other cave dwellers were doing to keep the story flowing.  In a book, it's easy to figure out what's going on based on reading Wanda's thoughts and reactions to things. It is my belief that it would have been a very boring movie if they kept the entire thing in her perspective, so I liked that there were some cut-overs.3) Overall concept - I feel like the overall concept was executed very well even if there were some modifications from the book.  Even though there changes, I think a viewer could easily understand and appreciate the story even if they hadn't read the book.THINGS I THINK COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER:1) I saw the movie prior to reading the novel, and after reading the novel, I understood much more why Wanda did not want to live.  Obviously, condensing a 600+ page book into a 2ish hour movie is a daunting task.  Wanda's background and reasons for not having ""children"" (in an alien sense) were not revealed in the movie.  I think it also would have helped if they had did more to develop how her presence in the cave had continued to cause a divide between the cave population, the friendships she developed with a few of the dwellers and how she felt after some of her only allies had perished really affected her character.  I would have liked to see that explored more.Overall,  I really liked the movie!",4,Well-staged movie adaptation of the novel,1376784000,"08 18, 2013",2013,2582,"['many', 'might', 'know', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'novel', 'written', 'Stephenie', 'Meyer', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'regarding', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'most', 'part', 'have', 'favorable', 'outlook', 'movie', 'whole.PROS:1', 'Casting', 'felt', 'casting', 'was', 'superb', 'Ronan', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'alien', 'trapped', 'human', 'host', 'sensed', 'same', 'kind', 'spunk', 'Melanie', 'voice-overs', 'did', 'novel', 'might', 'say', 'sounded', 'brat', 'let', 'be', 'real', 'here', 'body', 'got', 'taken', 'over', 'alien', 'spending', 'years', 'evading', 'aliens', 'trying', 'protect', 'loved', 'ones', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'p', 'ssed', 'off', 'too', 'Ronan', 'acting', 'also', 'told', 'story', 'how', 'conflicted', 'Wanda', 'had', 'become', 'taking', 'over', 'host', 'body', 'Uncle', 'Jeb', 'Maggie', 'Ian', 'Jared', 'were', 'also', 'cast', 'well', 'compare', 'novel', 'descriptions', 'movie', 'characters', 'were', 'changed', 'slightly', 'found', 'changes', 'were', 'better', 'Seeker', 'Wanda', 'new', 'host', 'body', 'few', 'others', 'were', 'described', 'differently', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'took', 'away', 'movie.2', 'liked', 'movie', 'structure', 'most', 'was', 'seen', 'Wanda', 'POV', 'were', 'cut-overs', 'show', 'what', 'Seeker', 'other', 'cave', 'dwellers', 'were', 'doing', 'keep', 'story', 'flowing', 'book', 'easy', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'based', 'reading', 'Wanda', 'thoughts', 'reactions', 'things', 'belief', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'boring', 'movie', 'kept', 'entire', 'thing', 'perspective', 'liked', 'were', 'cut-overs.3', 'Overall', 'concept', 'feel', 'overall', 'concept', 'was', 'executed', 'very', 'well', 'even', 'were', 'modifications', 'book', 'Even', 'changes', 'think', 'viewer', 'could', 'easily', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'story', 'even', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'book.THINGS', 'THINK', 'COULD', 'HAVE', 'BEEN', 'BETTER:1', 'saw', 'movie', 'prior', 'reading', 'novel', 'reading', 'novel', 'understood', 'much', 'more', 'why', 'Wanda', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'live', 'Obviously', 'condensing', '600+', 'page', 'book', '2ish', 'hour', 'movie', 'daunting', 'task', 'Wanda', 'background', 'reasons', 'not', 'having', 'children', 'alien', 'sense', 'were', 'not', 'revealed', 'movie', 'think', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'had', 'did', 'more', 'develop', 'how', 'presence', 'cave', 'had', 'continued', 'cause', 'divide', 'cave', 'population', 'friendships', 'developed', 'few', 'dwellers', 'how', 'felt', 'only', 'allies', 'had', 'perished', 'really', 'affected', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'explored', 'more.Overall', 'really', 'liked', 'movie']",The Host

Here are some happy after thoughts for me. 1. Stephanie Meyers.  Didn't know who she was until I started looking for the book to read after I watched The Host. Now I know she's a well talented love story artist. 2. Max Irons. Yeah, Jeremy's boy... also think King Edward of The White Queen... I'd say we have another &#34;Irons&#34; to notice when weighing our entertainment choices.  3. William Hurt turns in another impressive performance that makes some spots in the movie that might have been awkward run rather smoothly. 4. After some time thinking about this movie, I believe Saoirse Ronan did an admirable job with a very difficult character to play. And 5. An actual character growth and change driven science fiction plot. If we had more of those type science fiction movies, science fiction would not be relegated to SyFy Channel's struggle for mediocrity.This movie jumps to the end of the worn out Body Snatcher plot to begin its story. Then it develops... characters meet challenges that change them, for better or worse.

If we want to watch &#34;Invasion Of The Body Snatchers&#34; or &#34;Stepford Wives,&#34; we will.No, instead, this movie is about the idea that these celestial beings are not without feeling entirely, and that the main character's personality and thoughts still remains inside the &#34;Wanderer&#34; aka &#34;Wanda,&#34; so much she likes the same guy, and she begins to see what it means to be human.Even this story's main antagonist, The Seeker, played by Diane Kruger, clearly has anger issues, given that Wanda is obviously not that important to get a good deal of others killed. She is clearly just pissed off throughout the film, acting like she is complete control but opens fire on her own men just to get to Wanda.The inner talking of the personality by Saisore Ronan, who is Melanie Stryder, the original person whom &#34;Wanda&#34; is inhabiting, is excellent and well-done, sometimes hysterical and sometimes with deep meaning. It makes this film feel very different from pretty much any other.If you like sci-fi at all, you should give this one a watch.

1581458,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0090SI4LU,RMurray847,"[4, 8]","I've never read THE HOST, but based on the story presented on film, I don't think there was ever a way this was going to be a very good movie.  Earth has been taken over by a benign, peaceful alien race that occupies the bodies of humans (hosts), squashing the personality / soul of the person who once inhabited the body.  These aliens are, generally, passive and talk slow because that's how we know they are peaceful.A few human are struggling to hide from the aliens.  I'd like to call them a resistance, but they are far too passive themselves.  They live in the rock formations around Shiprock, New Mexico and sneak ""into town"" for supplies from time to time, but otherwise, they are not really making much of an effort to rid their planet of the invaders.  In a way, this makes sense, because they are so hugely outnumber, but it doesn't make for very good drama.Into their midst comes Melanie, a tough teen...who unfortunately has been implanted with an alien.  But Melanie is a fighter, and her personality has never disappeared, so she has a constant dialogue with her invader (who comes to be called Wanda).  Most of the drama comes from the fact that Melanie really likes a guy named Jared and Wanda, even though she's an alien, is drawn to Ian.  So we've got this weird ""triangle"" between 3 bodies / 4 souls.It's possible that some of this COULD have been interesting if told with either a) verve & energy or b) a breezy, light-hearted attitude.  But the movie THE HOST fails its own meager story by moving at a glacial pace in a drably colored world.  The rocks are brown, the costumes are browns and grays and even the crops being grown by the humans consist entirely of brown wheat.  The movie's score is ponderous...and for me to actually repeatedly notice the score, it has to be really good or really dreadful.  Sadly, THE HOST is dreadful...it sounds like public-domain music that would have been labeled ""Acoustic Folk Instrumentals:  Slow & Sad.""I was simply amazed at how slowly paced the movie was.  Very little happens, but what DOES happen is dragged out seemingly forever.  The very few action sequences there are have no zip.  THE HOST was written by Stephanie Meyers (of TWILIGHT fame), and it's clear the sci-fi trappings are of little interest to her, except as a way to create an awkward love triangle...much like the vampire/werewolf/human stuff she brought us in her more famous series.  But as terrible as the TWILIGHT movies were, they had a sense of humor and touches of tongue-in-cheek playfulness.  THE HOST is so earnest, it is deadly dull.Melanie/Wanda is played by the interesting young actress Saoirse Ronan (ATONEMENT, HANNA).  In the past, she's turned in some very nice performances.  In this film, she seems trapped by the pacing, and because Wanda the Alien is mostly in charge of her body, she plays most of the film with a look of wide-eyed wonder on her face...but little else.  She hasn't ruined her career here, but she hasn't exactly launched herself into stardom either.  But she fares much better than her two love interests, played by Max Irons and Jake Abel.  Granted, these guys have no real character development...but the two actors invest their roles with NOTHING.  Thus, neither of them has one smidgen of chemistry with Ronan.  Also, Ronan is still clearly a teenager (she's 19 now) and the men are well into their twenties.  Their love scenes feel vaguely icky and inappropriate.Diane Kruger plays ""The Seeker""...an alien bent on recovering Melanie/Wanda, because she knows how dangerous a combination they are.  The part is also under-written, and Kruger also manages to do little with it.  William Hurt plays the ""leader of the humans""...a man who also happens to be Melanie's uncle.  Hurt tries to infuse his character with some kind of heft, but again, the part is underwritten.The whole thing feels underwritten and half-baked.  No one feels committed to this film.  Nothing stands out as worthwhile.  Many bad films are at least full of energy, full of the EFFORT (wasted though it may have been) of making the film.  THE HOST feels like the film those same folks would have made...while sleepwalking.",2,"1.5 stars...a dull, slow-paced film",1364774400,"04 1, 2013",2013,4172,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'THE', 'HOST', 'based', 'story', 'presented', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'ever', 'way', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Earth', 'been', 'taken', 'over', 'benign', 'peaceful', 'alien', 'race', 'bodies', 'humans', 'hosts', 'squashing', 'personality', '/', 'soul', 'person', 'who', 'once', 'inhabited', 'body', 'aliens', 'are', 'generally', 'passive', 'talk', 'slow', 'how', 'know', 'are', 'peaceful.A', 'few', 'human', 'are', 'struggling', 'hide', 'aliens', ""'d"", 'like', 'call', 'resistance', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'passive', 'live', 'rock', 'formations', 'Shiprock', 'New', 'Mexico', 'sneak', 'town', 'supplies', 'time', 'time', 'otherwise', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'making', 'much', 'effort', 'rid', 'planet', 'invaders', 'way', 'sense', 'are', 'so', 'hugely', 'outnumber', ""n't"", 'make', 'very', 'good', 'drama.Into', 'midst', 'Melanie', 'tough', 'teen', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'been', 'implanted', 'alien', 'Melanie', 'fighter', 'personality', 'never', 'disappeared', 'constant', 'dialogue', 'invader', 'who', 'be', 'called', 'Wanda', 'Most', 'drama', 'fact', 'Melanie', 'really', 'guy', 'named', 'Jared', 'Wanda', 'even', 'alien', 'drawn', 'Ian', ""'ve"", 'got', 'weird', 'triangle', '3', 'bodies', '/', '4', 'souls.It', 'possible', 'COULD', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'told', 'verve', 'energy', 'b', 'breezy', 'light-hearted', 'attitude', 'movie', 'THE', 'HOST', 'own', 'meager', 'story', 'moving', 'glacial', 'pace', 'drably', 'colored', 'world', 'rocks', 'are', 'brown', 'costumes', 'are', 'browns', 'grays', 'even', 'crops', 'being', 'grown', 'humans', 'consist', 'entirely', 'brown', 'wheat', 'movie', 'score', 'ponderous', 'actually', 'repeatedly', 'score', 'be', 'really', 'good', 'really', 'dreadful', 'Sadly', 'HOST', 'dreadful', 'public-domain', 'music', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'labeled', 'Acoustic', 'Folk', 'Instrumentals', 'Slow', 'Sad', 'was', 'simply', 'amazed', 'how', 'slowly', 'paced', 'movie', 'was', 'Very', 'little', 'happens', 'what', 'DOES', 'happen', 'dragged', 'out', 'seemingly', 'forever', 'very', 'few', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'have', 'zip', 'HOST', 'was', 'written', 'Stephanie', 'Meyers', 'TWILIGHT', 'fame', 'clear', 'sci-fi', 'trappings', 'are', 'little', 'interest', 'way', 'create', 'awkward', 'love', 'triangle', 'much', 'vampire/werewolf/human', 'stuff', 'brought', 'more', 'famous', 'series', 'as', 'terrible', 'TWILIGHT', 'movies', 'were', 'had', 'sense', 'humor', 'touches', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'playfulness', 'HOST', 'so', 'earnest', 'deadly', 'dull.Melanie/Wanda', 'played', 'interesting', 'young', 'actress', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'ATONEMENT', 'HANNA', 'past', 'turned', 'very', 'nice', 'performances', 'film', 'trapped', 'pacing', 'Wanda', 'Alien', 'mostly', 'charge', 'body', 'most', 'film', 'look', 'wide-eyed', 'wonder', 'face', 'little', 'else', ""n't"", 'ruined', 'career', 'here', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'launched', 'stardom', 'either', 'much', 'better', 'two', 'love', 'interests', 'played', 'Max', 'Irons', 'Jake', 'Abel', 'Granted', 'guys', 'have', 'real', 'character', 'development', 'two', 'actors', 'invest', 'roles', 'NOTHING', 'Thus', 'one', 'smidgen', 'chemistry', 'Ronan', 'Also', 'Ronan', 'still', 'clearly', 'teenager', '19', 'now', 'men', 'are', 'well', 'twenties', 'love', 'scenes', 'feel', 'vaguely', 'icky', 'inappropriate.Diane', 'Kruger', 'Seeker', 'alien', 'bent', 'recovering', 'Melanie/Wanda', 'how', 'dangerous', 'combination', 'are', 'part', 'also', 'under-written', 'Kruger', 'also', 'do', 'little', 'William', 'Hurt', 'leader', 'humans', 'man', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'Melanie', 'uncle', 'Hurt', 'infuse', 'character', 'kind', 'heft', 'again', 'part', 'underwritten.The', 'whole', 'thing', 'feels', 'underwritten', 'half-baked', 'one', 'committed', 'film', 'Nothing', 'out', 'worthwhile', 'Many', 'bad', 'films', 'are', 'least', 'full', 'energy', 'full', 'EFFORT', 'wasted', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'making', 'film', 'HOST', 'feels', 'film', 'same', 'folks', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'sleepwalking']",The Host

It's such a refreshing story to me, it has romance but also such and interesting world and take on an alien invasion where well...the aliens are peaceful and live almost the ideal human utopia. I wish the movie had expounded a bit more on the race of Souls ~ I loved Wanderer's job in the new world being a teacher and her knowledge and experiences in all the other world's she had lived.

I would most likely give it a 3.5 but at the same time, I enjoyed it. A short movie of course will be condensed from such a large book and I really liked what they did with the setting and environment. It definitely brought the book back to life for me and it gives me a chance to share it with others who would probably never read the book. I liked most of the actors, especially Jeb and her brother, Jamie. Melanie/Wanda was good though sometimes came across younger than I felt she should have. Some of the romance felt rushed or cheesy but I expected that. I also expected Melanie's inner dialogue. Wanda never actually spoke to Melanie out loud in the books but then, in a movie that would be confusing at who's thoughts were speaking so I can't complain too much about it.I think the movie captured the main feelings of the story.

Yarbrough""","[0, 0]","I never knew Stephenie Meyer wrote anything besides Twilight until I saw a coworker reading The Host one day. She told me it was Meyer's attempt at writing something for a more mature audience. I knew I wasn't going to read it, but I did want to see the movie when it hit DVD.The concept is that aliens have taken over most of earth. They are a peaceful race and humans serve as hosts for the alien souls. The conflict arises from a group of humans who live in hiding who are confronted by one of their own who was recently captured, all while the alien seekers are trying to find them. Could an alien switch sides?  Is it possible for the human soul to still be alive inside their body? If so, can the human soul interact with the alien now living in its body?Saoirse Ronan does a great job in the lead as Melanie (the human) and Wanda (the alien). Her voice is in a slightly different register to help you determine which is speaking, though only the alien as function of her mouth when she takes over, and Melanie is an interval voice. She is surrounded by a young cast of mostly unknowns - but that's pretty much how the cast of Twilight started out too. I did recognize Boyd Holbrook only because I'd watched him on The Big C and recently in Behind the Candelabra.For those who prefer their alien fiction a little more fast paced, blow-them-up, giant space craft, war-type films, you'll hate The Host. There is nothing more than a bit of blood shed. The aliens themselves are even tiny, white, sea urchin-looking things. If you are looking for a different and interesting teenage romance, Meyer has served you that dish again just as she did with her previous books.  And there are some new and interesting concepts here when it comes to the whole romance thing: Melanie's lover, Jared, is there in the group. And another member of the group falls in love with Wanda. How does Melanie get Jared, her young brother, and the group to realize that she's still alive in there? Can they save her? What will happen to the alien?There are also a lot of underlying themes about the soul and reincarnation to explore here, which really makes this a serious and phenomenal film. Look past the young inexperienced cast and the fumbling romance stuff, and you will be rewarded with a film that is worth the watch. There's a great line in the film where the humans have been experimenting violently with extracting the aliens from the humans.  Wanda tells them it will come out peacefully if they just basically ask it to. It's very true of the way humans look upon those who are different or those who could be a threat. We act out in anger.Like everyone else, I loved making fun of Twilight even though I watched all four films.

The takeover is total, except in relatively few cases where the human host is actually strong enough to fight the invasion ... at least initially.  Sooner or later, though, it seems that everyone finally lets go as the alien fighting for control wins out.All, that is, except for Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan).  Part of an underground resistance movement comprised of a small band of humans, Melanie is out scouting with her kid brother and recently-acquired boyfriend Jared, when in order to save her brother she allows herself to be captured.  Immediately implanted, Melanie proves to be a formidable presence within her own body, refusing to relinquish control and even  at times taking over the thoughts and actions of the alien creature - named Wanda - inside her.  When the alien Seekers learn of Wanda's fight to get control, they tell her she'll be re-implanted the next day ... prompting Melanie to make Wanda, who is slowly learning to sympathize with the humans' plight, into running away before the Seekers can learn where the resisting humans - her only friends and family - are hidden.  The problem then not only becomes the Seekers in hot pursuit of Melanie/Wanda (including one, in particular, determined to find the humans), but for Melanie, how to also show up to her friends and family in hiding without getting killed, when they see she's ""become"" an alien host?Not a great movie, not a lot of great acting here, but the story and plot keeps enough momentum and suspense going to keep you watching, all of course requiring your suspension of belief ... but certainly not to the ludicrous extent that 'Twilight' similarly demanded.",3,Beats 'Twilight' ... but still could have been better,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,2098,"['can', 'feel', 'stamp', 'Stephenie', 'Meyer', ""'Twilight"", 'films', ""'The"", 'Host', 'least', 'here', 'parts', 'triangle', 'are', 'least', 'human', 'well', 'mostly', 'story', 'bit', 'more', 'interesting', 'Bella', 'whining', 'as', 'well', 'Host', 'opens', 'Earth', 'where', 'human', 'beings', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'alien', 'species', 'can', 'only', 'survive', 'entering', 'taking', 'over', 'people', 'turning', 'emotionless', 'highly-intelligent', 'drones', 'takeover', 'total', 'relatively', 'few', 'cases', 'where', 'human', 'host', 'actually', 'strong', 'enough', 'fight', 'invasion', 'least', 'initially', 'Sooner', 'later', 'everyone', 'finally', 'go', 'alien', 'fighting', 'control', 'out.All', 'Melanie', 'Stryder', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'Part', 'underground', 'resistance', 'movement', 'comprised', 'small', 'band', 'humans', 'Melanie', 'out', 'scouting', 'kid', 'brother', 'recently-acquired', 'boyfriend', 'Jared', 'when', 'order', 'save', 'brother', 'be', 'captured', 'Immediately', 'implanted', 'Melanie', 'be', 'formidable', 'presence', 'own', 'body', 'refusing', 'relinquish', 'control', 'even', 'times', 'taking', 'thoughts', 'actions', 'alien', 'creature', 'named', 'Wanda', 'When', 'alien', 'Seekers', 'learn', 'Wanda', 'fight', 'get', 'control', 'tell', ""'ll"", 'be', 're-implanted', 'next', 'day', 'prompting', 'Melanie', 'make', 'Wanda', 'who', 'slowly', 'learning', 'sympathize', 'humans', 'plight', 'running', 'away', 'Seekers', 'can', 'learn', 'where', 'resisting', 'humans', 'only', 'friends', 'family', 'are', 'hidden', 'problem', 'then', 'not', 'only', 'Seekers', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'Melanie/Wanda', 'including', 'one', 'particular', 'determined', 'find', 'humans', 'Melanie', 'how', 'also', 'show', 'up', 'friends', 'family', 'hiding', 'getting', 'killed', 'when', 'see', 'become', 'alien', 'host', 'Not', 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'lot', 'great', 'acting', 'here', 'story', 'plot', 'keeps', 'enough', 'momentum', 'suspense', 'going', 'keep', 'watching', 'course', 'requiring', 'suspension', 'belief', 'certainly', 'not', 'ludicrous', 'extent', ""'Twilight"", 'similarly', 'demanded']",The Host

1581492,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B0090SI4LU,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[9, 14]","My current top three directors in no particular order are: Joe Wright, Joseph Kosinski, and Andrew Niccol. All three of them know how to use visuals to tell an amazing story, and harken back to the good-old-days of film-making when it was a craft perfected by great directors. I've been a fan of Andrew Niccols (okay, a raving lunatic fan) ever since I saw GATTACA as a teen and had my mind blown into a million pieces. Since then I've contemplated how much better Truman Show would have been if he directed instead of just wrote the script, I've been deeply encouraged and satisfied with the Bonnie and Clyde masterpiece In Time, and now, in opinion he may have FINALLY cemented the kind of attention he has always deserved (according to one Website I checked prior to this film's release the box office average gross of all of his films combined was a measly 20 million).GATTACA had amazing cinematography and acting (and a very good musical score), Truman Show had a great concept, and In Time had a an incredible idea and compelling world that made for an incredibly entertaining film. And this film....demands that you buy the Blu Ray as soon as humanly possible.When I realized that this movie was based on the book by Stephenie Meyer the first time I saw the preview, I was ready to write it off as an afterthought. But as the trailer progressed the same thing happened to me that happened to me when I saw the Tron:Legacy and Pride and Prejudice trailers. The visuals were SO well done, the film looked so well made and excellently crafted, I was instantly made curious. And when I saw that it was written for the screen and directed by Andrew Niccol I was ready to laugh like a madman for joy. This feeling was not misled.While the fans of the book (which I have not read and am in hurry to do so) may have issues with truncated story, removed characters, condensed plot, etc, I have no such issues. I am watching this film on its own merits. And great merits they are. This film is superbly well directed. The cinematography could be a showcase for you Blu Ray player and plasma TV. Some of the sets look like the director took one look at the best concept art and said ""I don't care how much it costs I want this image EXACTLY on screen and breathed to life."" Between waves of wheat under a ceiling of solar panels, vast desert vistas, and canyon vistas, the scenery on this film is spectacularly filmed. The actors all do a very admirable job with their roles, but the characterizations have a feel that some people may not care for.I suspect that like me, the director may relate more to the undercurrents and backgrounds of life, and the internal thoughts and emotions of people rather than their outward appearance. What I'm saying is that this film is outwardly awkward and internally subtle, and I think introverts will be drawn to those kinds of characterizations more than other types of people. For others who just read the surface, they will find the characters are much too cool and distant, the romance laughably bad rather than laughably enjoyably good (think Star Wars or Hitchcock romance). And despite the awesome acting on the part of the main character, some people just might get tired of the endless internal monologue. I didn't. But some people might.As for my point of view, both me and my wife enjoyed the film enormously despite its shortcomings and perhaps a few flaws or holes (mileage will vary on how excusable they are). This is a movie that I can just sit back and enjoy, soaking in the gorgeous visuals and entertaining characters. I'll be picking up the Blu Ray along with Oblivion sooner rather than later.

It is a sci-fi romance about two boys and one girl, and the girl is torn between the two boys. Based on a Stephenie Meyer novel of the same name, &#8220;The Host&#8221; not surprisingly looks a bit like the &#8220;Twilight&#8221; saga. The difference is that, well, the heroine Melanie (played Saoirse Ronan, &#8220;Atonement&#8221;) is not just &#8220;a girl,&#8221; but a girl implanted with a parasitic alien. And the alien&#8217;s name is &#8220;Wanda.&#8221;Set in the world where most humans are taken over by small aliens named &#8220;Souls,&#8221; &#8220;The Host&#8221; follows the romance of our heroine Melanie Stryder, a human who persuades her &#8220;Soul&#8221; controlling her body (named Wanderer, then Wanda) to run away from the aliens&#8217; institute to go back to where Melanie came. Melanie/Wanda is pursued by The Seeker (Diane Kruger), dead serious leader of the team hunting down the remaining humans.Though panned by critics, &#8220;The Host&#8221; is not really that bad. Yes, the story lacks dramatic tension with two male characters hardly distinguishable from each other. The Seeker keeps seeking but her motive is not convincing. But visuals are interesting and at least Saoirse Ronan shows what a talented player like her can do, even though her &#8220;voiceover&#8221; sounds strange.Finally, &#8220;The Host&#8221; is directed by Andrew Niccol, director of intelligent sci-fi drama &#8220;Gattaca&#8221; and writer of &#8220;The Truman Show&#8221; (for which he was Oscar nominated). He has directed three films since then &#8211; &#8220;S1m0ne,&#8221; &#8220;Lord of War&#8221; and &#8220;In Time&#8221; &#8211; all of which have great ideas, but none of them knows how to develop them, just like &#8220;The Host,&#8221; his latest film that starts out well but fails to live up to its promise.",3,(2.5 STARS) Two Minds in One Body,1404000000,"06 29, 2014",2014,1896,"['First', 'things', 'first', '8220', 'Host', '8221', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'sci-fi', 'romance', 'two', 'boys', 'one', 'girl', 'girl', 'torn', 'two', 'boys', 'Based', 'Stephenie', 'Meyer', 'novel', 'same', 'name', '8220', 'Host', '8221', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'bit', '8220', 'Twilight', '8221', 'saga', 'difference', 'well', 'heroine', 'Melanie', 'played', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', '8220', 'Atonement', '8221', 'not', 'just', '8220', 'girl', '8221', 'girl', 'implanted', 'parasitic', 'alien', 'alien', '8217', 's', 'name', '8220', 'Wanda.', '8221', 'Set', 'world', 'where', 'most', 'humans', 'are', 'taken', 'over', 'small', 'aliens', 'named', '8220', 'Souls', '8221', '8220', 'Host', '8221', 'romance', 'heroine', 'Melanie', 'Stryder', 'human', 'who', '8220', 'Soul', '8221', 'controlling', 'body', 'named', 'Wanderer', 'then', 'Wanda', 'run', 'away', 'aliens', '8217', 'institute', 'go', 'back', 'where', 'Melanie', 'came', 'Melanie/Wanda', 'pursued', 'Seeker', 'Diane', 'Kruger', 'dead', 'serious', 'leader', 'team', 'hunting', 'down', 'remaining', 'humans.Though', 'panned', 'critics', '8220', 'Host', '8221', 'not', 'really', 'bad', 'Yes', 'story', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'two', 'male', 'characters', 'hardly', 'distinguishable', 'other', 'Seeker', 'seeking', 'motive', 'not', 'convincing', 'visuals', 'are', 'interesting', 'least', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'what', 'talented', 'player', 'can', 'do', 'even', '8220', '8221', 'strange.Finally', '8220', 'Host', '8221', 'directed', 'Andrew', 'Niccol', 'director', 'intelligent', 'sci-fi', 'drama', '8220', 'Gattaca', '8221', 'writer', '8220', 'Truman', 'Show', '8221', 'was', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'directed', 'three', 'films', 'then', '8211', '8220', 'S1m0ne', '8221', '8220', 'Lord', 'War', '8221', '8220', 'Time', '8221', '8211', 'have', 'great', 'ideas', 'none', 'how', 'develop', 'just', '8220', 'Host', '8221', 'latest', 'film', 'out', 'well', 'live', 'up', 'promise']",The Host

The names are painfully corny (Melanie STRYDER? really??) and smack of junior high dreams of authoring a novel ""when I grow up"". The details are poorly thought out (these aliens have the technology to travel through space, but not to find humans hiding out??). The high school bully angst of the guys who dislike Wanderer/It/Melanie in the human colony is so one-dimensional.

1581512,A1AST6JNBJ95VC,B0090SI4LU,Victory,"[1, 4]","My wife and I fell asleep.  Not sure about her but I just couldn't give a damn from the beginning.  Check this out:The boyfriend intro was as clumsy as it was bizarre.  The first thing he does is hold a knife to her throat because he thinks she's an alien.  Then seeing she's a human plants a hard sultry kiss on her.  She bats him away.  Chase ensues.  He tackles her and she tells him to get off her.  His excuse for acting like that?  ""Duhhh!  I haven't seen a human in two years.""  Whaaat. . ?  So when you see one your first impulse is to hump it?So anyway, they get separated and she gets infected with an alien and catches up to him in the desert.  She's overwhelmed with joy at seeing him again and runs to him.  His response?  He backhands her because she's been infected.  This is just weird.  Peoples' emotions seem to be able to turn on a dime with no warning or reason in this movie.  That's big trouble.But there's a big problem with her characterization as well.  Ultimately, the boyfriend (I don't know his name and I don't care what it is) introduces himself like a rapist: Knife at the throat, hard sloppy kiss, jumps on top.  Now, I'm thinking what kind of female viewer is going to warm up to that kind of guy?  I suppose there are a few women out there who might BUT those women, I don't think, are the same women who would say a little bit later on in the relationship, ""Sleep with me.""  If your boyfriend introduces himself like a rapist, I'm thinking the dialog would be a lot less innocent sounding than that.  Sorry if you're offended but I think a movie should make sense.So the characterization is totally unbelieveable.  And after they meet again and he smacks her I basically tune out because these characters are as fake as a 3 dollar bill.  This is my first exposure to Stephanie Meyer and I'm wondering if the clumsy, bumbling characterization is one of the reasons writers like Stephen King can't stand her.

When they describe it as a ""Romantic Thriller,"" it's more romance than thriller. For the most part, the movie kept my attention, I liked the characters and felt everything was well done. I felt the movie did fizzle out in a few areas but nothing major. The ending, the very last part, did not seem to fit. An add-on that was a bit too much.

1581518,AP3B615GM191G,B0090SI4LU,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[12, 16]","I'm usually a fan of science fiction fare and so, after hearing some good things about ""The Host"", I finally decided to give it a look.  While some of its science fiction aspects did appeal to me, I mainly just felt let down, like I was watching an emotionally ""flat"" movie.For a basic plot summary, ""The Host"" sees Earth being colonized by aliens who take over bodies and suppress the human souls.  When this process happens to Melanie Styder (Saoirse Ronan), however, her soul fights back against ""Wanderer"", the new alien being.  With this internal battle raging in Melanie's body, she reconnects with her younger brother (Chandler Canterbury), former boyfriend (Max Irons), and uncle (William Hurt) who just so happens to be leading a pocket of human resistance against the colonizers.To me, the interesting parts of this movie consisted of the battle between Wanderer and Melanie for which soul would rest in their shared body.  A lot of ""what it means to be human"" themes swirl around, many of which produce some deep-thought issues.The trouble is, I felt that the acting and directing was woefully inadequate to portray some of those lofty philosophical ideals.  The film was just too stark and stoic to ever draw out the kind of true, real emotion that can make characters memorable.  The ""love triangle"" evident about half way through the movie has no ""kick"" because the two male members just don't have much character development.  The same can be said for the young boy character.  Just not enough ""acting meat"" to ever make me truly care about the principles.Finally, and this may get me a few automatic down-votes alone, but I feel this is a movie that appeals much more to women and their feelings/emotions.  I won't come out and call it a bona fide ""chick flick"", but groups of guys won't be going to see this one.  While watching, I sometimes wondered ""Is this a great sci-fi tale...or a romance jammed into a somewhat workable plot?"".
