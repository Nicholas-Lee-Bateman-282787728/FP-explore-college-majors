The one &#34;difficulty&#34; that I had was in the way that some of this was filmed. Instead of standing still and panning across the vista, the photographer chose a constantly moving point to shoot from (this &#34;shooting point&#34; was constantly moving in a slowly closing vortex), I found that I had several instances of motion sickness during the viewing- especially the Iceland episode. Not a pleasant moment! On the other hand, my husband has never had motion sickness problems and didn't have a problem with it at all. Unfortunately, our 9-year-old son also had to close his eyes several times during that episode to get over the same problem I had.
