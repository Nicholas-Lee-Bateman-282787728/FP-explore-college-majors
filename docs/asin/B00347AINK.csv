It holds your interest but after viewing it you shrug your shoulders.  Jamie Lee Curtis, one of our great unsung actresses (should have scored an Oscar nom for her work in ""True Lies"" or ""Freaky Friday"" for that matter), is merely adequate as Dorothy Stratten.  Robert Reed, playing a Peter Bogdanovich type, is merely laughable.  The only performance that grabs your interest is Bruce Weitz's(Mick Belker from ""Hill Street Blues"") for all the wrong reasons.  Granted that the film's title telegraphs it's ominous conclusion Weitz chews the scenery to such a degree as Paul Snider that we have no doubts about his culpability.  Do yourself a favor and check out Bob Fosse's ""Star 80"" and particularly Eric Roberts multilayered turn as Snider.  ""Galaxina"" is a must but avoid Bogdanovich's ""They All Laughed"" at all costs.",3,"Hef Made a Better Hef In ""House Bunny""",1267920000,"03 7, 2010",2010,952,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'ripped', 'headlines', 'TV', 'movie', 'not', 'particularly', 'exploitive', 'not', 'great', 'interest', 'viewing', 'shrug', 'shoulders', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'one', 'great', 'unsung', 'actresses', 'should', 'have', 'scored', 'Oscar', 'nom', 'work', 'True', 'Lies', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'matter', 'merely', 'adequate', 'Dorothy', 'Stratten', 'Robert', 'Reed', 'playing', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'type', 'merely', 'laughable', 'only', 'performance', 'interest', 'Bruce', 'Weitz', 'Mick', 'Belker', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'Granted', 'film', 'title', 'telegraphs', 'ominous', 'conclusion', 'Weitz', 'scenery', 'degree', 'Paul', 'Snider', 'have', 'doubts', 'culpability', 'Do', 'favor', 'check', 'out', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'Star', '80', 'particularly', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'multilayered', 'turn', 'Snider', 'Galaxina', 'must', 'avoid', 'Bogdanovich', 'Laughed', 'costs']",N/A
1320848,A2NA9CGPX4KJ1U,B00347AINK,"R. Smith ""bookworm""","[2, 2]","This 1981 made-for-TV docudrama depicts the life of murdered glamour model/actress Dorothy Stratten.  It features Jamie Lee Curtis as shy, sensitive Dorothy Hoogstraten who is plucked from the obscurity of her Vancouver town by a lowlife pimp, Paul Snider (played by the middle-aged Bruce Weitz).I didn't hate the movie, unlike some other viewers.  It is somewhat entertaining and Jamie Lee definitely captures Dorothy's sweetness, although she lacks the bombshell beauty that Dorothy had.  I will admit that I teared up a bit during certain scenes in the movie, like when Dorothy was being cautioned about avoiding Paul and how she decided to leave Vancouver for Hollywood anyway.  Jamie Lee Curtis nailed the vulnerability and innocence of Dorothy to a T.  You can see how worried everyone is about her, but she seems destined for both fame and tragedy.My biggest issues with the movie were as follows...the Paul Snider character, for starters.  Paul was older than Dorothy in real life, yes, but only by 8 years.  Bruce Weitz was at least 50 in this movie.  What the heck?!  Paul was 29 when he died.  He was a streetwise dude, but come on, he wasn't some geezer with a raspy voice and weathered looks.Second, the family relationship.  After doing some research, I now know that Dorothy's mother and sister wanted to be portrayed as her aunt and cousin instead.  I guess because it was only a year after Dorothy's murder and it was still too painful.  And from what I read, Louise was bullied a bit in school after her sister died, so maybe it was better to alter some of the facts.  Still, that might be confusing for viewers who don't know much about the real events.And third, it is painfully low-budget.  If you're looking for a relatively simple movie about Dorothy Stratten, check this one out.  But if you want a more sophisticated, complex version I recommend ""Star 80"".  Maybe I'm biased because I love Bob Fosse's work but ""Star 80"" is an excellent portrayal of what really happened, right down to the brutal murder-suicide (which is filmed in the actual apartment where it happened).  Like Jamie Lee Curtis, Mariel Hemingway doesn't have the striking beauty that Dorothy had, but she does a fine job in ""Star 80"".And unlike this movie, ""Star 80"" gets it right with their portrayal of the real Paul Snider.  Eric Roberts is the right age, unlike Bruce Weitz, and he conveys the essence of Paul much more convincingly.",3,"Worth watching, but Star 80 is better",1373587200,"07 12, 2013",2013,2430,"['1981', 'made-for-TV', 'docudrama', 'life', 'murdered', 'glamour', 'model/actress', 'Dorothy', 'Stratten', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'shy', 'sensitive', 'Dorothy', 'Hoogstraten', 'who', 'plucked', 'obscurity', 'Vancouver', 'town', 'lowlife', 'pimp', 'Paul', 'Snider', 'played', 'middle-aged', 'Bruce', 'Weitz', '.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'movie', 'other', 'viewers', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'definitely', 'Dorothy', 'sweetness', 'bombshell', 'beauty', 'Dorothy', 'had', 'will', 'admit', 'teared', 'up', 'bit', 'certain', 'scenes', 'movie', 'when', 'Dorothy', 'was', 'being', 'cautioned', 'avoiding', 'Paul', 'how', 'decided', 'leave', 'Vancouver', 'Hollywood', 'anyway', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'nailed', 'vulnerability', 'innocence', 'Dorothy', 'T.', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'worried', 'everyone', 'destined', 'fame', 'tragedy.My', 'biggest', 'issues', 'movie', 'were', 'Paul', 'Snider', 'character', 'starters', 'Paul', 'was', 'older', 'Dorothy', 'real', 'life', 'yes', 'only', '8', 'years', 'Bruce', 'Weitz', 'was', 'least', '50', 'movie', 'What', 'heck', 'Paul', 'was', '29', 'when', 'died', 'was', 'streetwise', 'dude', 'come', 'was', ""n't"", 'geezer', 'raspy', 'voice', 'weathered', 'looks.Second', 'family', 'relationship', 'doing', 'research', 'now', 'know', 'Dorothy', 'mother', 'sister', 'wanted', 'be', 'portrayed', 'aunt', 'cousin', 'instead', 'guess', 'was', 'only', 'year', 'Dorothy', 'murder', 'was', 'still', 'too', 'painful', 'what', 'read', 'Louise', 'was', 'bullied', 'bit', 'school', 'sister', 'died', 'maybe', 'was', 'better', 'alter', 'facts', 'Still', 'might', 'be', 'confusing', 'viewers', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'real', 'events.And', 'third', 'painfully', 'low-budget', ""'re"", 'looking', 'relatively', 'simple', 'movie', 'Dorothy', 'Stratten', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'want', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'complex', 'version', 'recommend', 'Star', '80', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'biased', 'love', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'work', 'Star', '80', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'right', 'down', 'brutal', 'murder-suicide', 'filmed', 'actual', 'apartment', 'where', 'happened', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'Mariel', 'Hemingway', ""n't"", 'have', 'striking', 'beauty', 'Dorothy', 'had', 'fine', 'job', 'Star', '80', '.And', 'movie', 'Star', '80', 'right', 'portrayal', 'real', 'Paul', 'Snider', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'right', 'age', 'Bruce', 'Weitz', 'essence', 'Paul', 'much', 'more', 'convincingly']",N/A

1320850,A17Z53UM2E111A,B00347AINK,T. P. Watt,"[1, 1]","In terms of realism, Death Of A Centerfold manages to get some of the bare-bones facts of the Dorothy Stratten/Paul Snider story correct. I suppose the kindest thing I can say about this made-for-tv movie is that because of the very milieu it was working in, expectations shouldn't be as high as that of a feature-length motion picture. The broad outlines of the tale (young Canadian girl is wooed by a small-time hustler, through this association eventually becomes a Playboy playmate, marries the hustler then parlays her Playboy exposure into some minor tv appearances and film roles before being murdered by her estranged husband) are presented intact. I guess the problem for me is that I saw this movie after having read a good deal and viewed a fair amount of film about the actual people involved. Jamie Lee Curtis is okay, I suppose, although she doesn't look anything like Stratten (and let's be honest: Curtis wasn't unattractive but hardly representative of a Playmate). Robert Reed plays a watered-down character based on Peter Bogdanovich, which provides little more than the sort of staid, stilted performance one would expect from a lifelong tv actor. The ridiculousness REALLY comes into the fore whenever Hill St. Blues alumni Bruce Weitz (the scruffy undercover detective who used to call everyone 'dogface') is onscreen. Weitz was inexplicably chosen to play Paul Snider. Snider was in his mid-to-late twenties when he was involved with Stratten. Weitz looks like he's pushing 50 here, and keeps peppering his dialogue with expressions like 'don't try to jive me, baby'...oh, it's just silly beyond belief to anyone who has even so much as seen photos of the real people. If one is looking for a dramatized version of the Dorothy Stratten story, the only undertaking of any merit is still the 1983 movie Star 80: as grim as that film is, at least one can watch it without bursting into laughter every time the Paul Snider character is onscreen.
