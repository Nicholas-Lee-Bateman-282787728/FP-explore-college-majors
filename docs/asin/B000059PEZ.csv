Certainly the Burton/Taylor/Zefferelli film is the best movie version, but this filmed theater production has a lot going for it as well. First of all, the director, Kirk Browning, is one of our hidden national treasures. He has had a long career of bringing quality productions from the theater and from opera to the small screen. This is one of his crowning achievements.Not everyone has had the chance to venture out to San Francisco and catch a live presentation from one of the top two repertory companies in the the nation, The American Conservatory Theater (ACT), on Geary st. in that fair city. This production catches a great company at its best. It is worthy of time-capsule status. This is from the golden era of theater and from a period when Bill Ball was still at the helm of an institution that has always had the highest reputation for quality staging and for a great ensemble troupe of players.ACT has always stressed two aspects both in terms of training and production, physical dexterity (including energy) and vocal acuity (the resident speech trainer, Anne Fletcher, was one of the best in the business). This production highlights both. The actors have verve, panache and speek the speech &quot;trippingly on the tongue.&quot; Marc Singer and Fredi Olster create the sort of dynamic interplay that unfortunately is all too rare in most productions of this play. They appear to be having a ball.Singer also shines as Christian in another ACT production (Cyrano de Bergerac) which is also available in the Broadway Thater Archives series. An ACT fixture, Peter Donat, is the memorable Cyrano in that play. Those of you who only know of Singer from his role as The Beastmaster, will be pleasantly surprised at what a quality actor he really is.",5,A Production Not to Be Overlooked,1047600000,"03 14, 2003",2003,1848,"['hard', 'say', 'favorite', 'available', 'version', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'Certainly', 'Burton/Taylor/Zefferelli', 'film', 'best', 'movie', 'version', 'filmed', 'theater', 'production', 'lot', 'going', 'as', 'well', 'First', 'all', 'director', 'Kirk', 'Browning', 'one', 'hidden', 'national', 'treasures', 'had', 'long', 'career', 'bringing', 'quality', 'productions', 'theater', 'opera', 'small', 'screen', 'one', 'crowning', 'achievements.Not', 'everyone', 'had', 'chance', 'venture', 'out', 'San', 'Francisco', 'catch', 'live', 'presentation', 'one', 'top', 'two', 'repertory', 'companies', 'nation', 'American', 'Conservatory', 'Theater', 'ACT', 'Geary', 'st.', 'fair', 'city', 'production', 'great', 'company', 'best', 'worthy', 'time-capsule', 'status', 'golden', 'era', 'theater', 'period', 'when', 'Bill', 'Ball', 'was', 'still', 'helm', 'institution', 'always', 'had', 'highest', 'reputation', 'quality', 'staging', 'great', 'ensemble', 'troupe', 'players.ACT', 'always', 'stressed', 'two', 'aspects', 'terms', 'training', 'production', 'physical', 'dexterity', 'including', 'energy', 'vocal', 'acuity', 'resident', 'speech', 'trainer', 'Anne', 'Fletcher', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'business', 'production', 'actors', 'have', 'verve', 'panache', 'speek', 'speech', 'quot', 'trippingly', 'tongue.', 'quot', 'Marc', 'Singer', 'Fredi', 'Olster', 'create', 'sort', 'dynamic', 'interplay', 'unfortunately', 'too', 'rare', 'most', 'productions', 'play', 'appear', 'be', 'having', 'ball.Singer', 'also', 'Christian', 'ACT', 'production', 'Cyrano', 'de', 'Bergerac', 'also', 'available', 'Broadway', 'Thater', 'Archives', 'series', 'ACT', 'fixture', 'Peter', 'Donat', 'memorable', 'Cyrano', 'play', 'who', 'only', 'know', 'Singer', 'role', 'Beastmaster', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'what', 'quality', 'actor', 'really']",The Taming of the Shrew Broadway Theatre Archive  VHS

I had seen Shakespearean movies before but this was my first attendence at a live staging of one of his plays. Wow! It was fantastic. I was just telling our dinner guests tonight that every production I see of Shakespeare's plays I compare to this one -- because it was The Best.The stage sets are minimal, but the costumes are vibrant, and the actors are energetic and speak their lines in a way that adds new insight to those who have only read the play. The scenes between Kate and Petruchio are delightful. I wish everyone who loves Shakespeare could have been there to see this version live.Because of my attendence at this ACT stage peformance, I tend to be critical of many of the Hollywood versions of Shakespeare. They may have superior film quality and cinematography but they just cannot compare to stage versions in the quality of the acting and the clever interpretation of Shakespeare's lines. These stage versions bring Shakespeare to life. The actors make the lines in play come to life, adding humor to lines that did not seem funny when reading the play. The repartee in this stage version is wonderful.Recommendation (I hope this is released on DVD too):I do not know if this other ACT Shakespeare play production was filmed but I will mention it too:  When the Geary theatre reopened in San Francisco after repairs of the damage from the 1989 earthquake, the ACT christened the opening of the refurbished theatre with a production of The Tempest. This is apparently a stage tradition ensuring good luck for the theatre just as putting on Macbeth is considered bad luck.  I convinced my husband that we HAD to go see the Tempest. I told him how wonderful the ACT Taming of the Shrew had been.While not quite as exciting (for me) as the ACT Taming of the Shrew from the 70s, The Tempest was still very good. I had read the play at least twice before hand and seeing it staged at ACT was eye-opening. Again, lines that did not seem funny when reading the play became hilarious with the interpretion of them by the ACT actors. Again, the stage set was minimal, the costumes superb and the acting excellent. This ACT version also incorporated some very creative puppetry. This was my husband's first exposure to Shakespeare on stage. He was blown away.",5,If only all Shakespeare productions were this Great!,1173571200,"03 11, 2007",2007,2330,"['saw', 'live', 'ACT', 'San', 'Francisco', 'reviewer', 'had', 'seen', 'Shakespearean', 'movies', 'was', 'first', 'attendence', 'live', 'staging', 'one', 'plays', 'Wow', 'was', 'fantastic', 'was', 'just', 'telling', 'dinner', 'guests', 'tonight', 'production', 'see', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', 'compare', 'one', 'was', 'Best.The', 'stage', 'sets', 'are', 'minimal', 'costumes', 'are', 'vibrant', 'actors', 'are', 'energetic', 'speak', 'lines', 'way', 'new', 'insight', 'who', 'have', 'only', 'read', 'play', 'scenes', 'Kate', 'Petruchio', 'are', 'delightful', 'wish', 'everyone', 'who', 'Shakespeare', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'see', 'version', 'live.Because', 'attendence', 'ACT', 'stage', 'peformance', 'tend', 'be', 'critical', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'versions', 'Shakespeare', 'may', 'have', 'superior', 'film', 'quality', 'cinematography', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'stage', 'versions', 'quality', 'acting', 'clever', 'interpretation', 'Shakespeare', 'lines', 'stage', 'versions', 'bring', 'Shakespeare', 'life', 'actors', 'make', 'lines', 'play', 'come', 'life', 'adding', 'humor', 'lines', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'funny', 'when', 'reading', 'play', 'repartee', 'stage', 'version', 'wonderful.Recommendation', 'hope', 'released', 'DVD', 'too', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'other', 'ACT', 'Shakespeare', 'play', 'production', 'was', 'filmed', 'will', 'mention', 'too', 'When', 'Geary', 'theatre', 'reopened', 'San', 'Francisco', 'repairs', 'damage', '1989', 'earthquake', 'ACT', 'christened', 'opening', 'refurbished', 'theatre', 'production', 'Tempest', 'apparently', 'stage', 'tradition', 'ensuring', 'good', 'luck', 'theatre', 'just', 'putting', 'Macbeth', 'considered', 'bad', 'luck', 'convinced', 'husband', 'HAD', 'go', 'see', 'Tempest', 'told', 'how', 'wonderful', 'ACT', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'had', 'not', 'quite', 'exciting', 'ACT', 'Taming', 'Shrew', '70s', 'Tempest', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'had', 'read', 'play', 'least', 'twice', 'before', 'hand', 'seeing', 'staged', 'ACT', 'was', 'eye-opening', 'Again', 'lines', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'funny', 'when', 'reading', 'play', 'became', 'hilarious', 'interpretion', 'ACT', 'actors', 'Again', 'stage', 'set', 'was', 'minimal', 'costumes', 'superb', 'acting', 'excellent', 'ACT', 'version', 'also', 'incorporated', 'very', 'creative', 'puppetry', 'was', 'husband', 'first', 'exposure', 'Shakespeare', 'stage', 'was', 'blown', 'away']",The Taming of the Shrew Broadway Theatre Archive  VHS

The director's decision to present this somewhat sexist comedy as an over-the-top commedia dell'arte production was brilliant. Patruchio's use of physical violence to tame his headstrong finacee is somehow made tolerable because all the relationships in this play are embued with violence. And like characters in a Roadrunner cartoon, victims bounce back with vigor and always manage to give as good as they get. The troupe is incredibly in sync with one another, highly athletic, and incredibly gifted at reciting their iambic pentameter flawlessly while being twirled overhead or kicked in the groin. It really has to be seen to be believed. And who knew Marc Singer, the Beastmaster, could act?!

573762,A3DD96LN8U1NM,B000059PEZ,citygal,"[2, 3]","This version may take some getting used to for the modern audience because it is based on the commedia del'arte style, which is more slapstick and physical.  However, it is the BEST version of Taming of the Shrew that has been done, IMHO.  To even more fully appreciate the this version, read the play before watching it.  Then, you'll recognize the genius of the acting, particularly Marc Singer as Petruchio.  He is able say the lines in such a way so that the meaning is changed, making the play [the text of which is overtly sexist] much more palatable to the modern audience.  For example, when Petruchio takes Kate to his home, he purposely denies her food and sleep all in the name of love, but really to ""tame"" her from her ""shrewish"" ways.  Now, this is a hard part of the written play for a modern reader to stomach because it is abusive.  However, in a soliloquy, Singer reveals his plan to the audience. When he gets to this line--""This is a way to kill a wife with kindness""---he has this confused look on his face while scratching his head that makes him seem to be a man that is trying to figure out how to best handle Kate but really has no idea. That, and other parts of that scene, really take the brutality out of it and re-inject it with humor.  It's just a small example, but there are many other such examples in the play where the delivery of the lines, the expressions, and the staging are pure genius.  I love this version because it doesn't destroy the original text by making it PC. Rather, it makes us believe that Kate and Petruchio ultimately love each other.  I have yet to see a better Petruccio and Kate or a better version of this play. Certainly, the non-stop screeching of Liz Taylor in the Zeffirelli version is absolutely no match for Olster's performance in this version.",5,The Best TOTS --bar none,1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,1810,"['version', 'may', 'take', 'getting', 'used', 'modern', 'audience', 'based', 'commedia', ""del'arte"", 'style', 'more', 'slapstick', 'physical', 'However', 'BEST', 'version', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'been', 'done', 'IMHO', 'even', 'more', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'version', 'read', 'play', 'watching', 'Then', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'genius', 'acting', 'particularly', 'Marc', 'Singer', 'Petruchio', 'able', 'say', 'lines', 'such', 'way', 'meaning', 'changed', 'making', 'play', 'text', 'overtly', 'sexist', ']', 'much', 'more', 'palatable', 'modern', 'audience', 'example', 'when', 'Petruchio', 'Kate', 'home', 'purposely', 'food', 'sleep', 'name', 'love', 'really', 'tame', 'shrewish', 'ways', 'Now', 'hard', 'part', 'written', 'play', 'modern', 'reader', 'stomach', 'abusive', 'However', 'soliloquy', 'Singer', 'plan', 'audience', 'When', 'line', 'way', 'kill', 'wife', 'kindness', '-he', 'confused', 'look', 'face', 'scratching', 'head', 'seem', 'be', 'man', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'best', 'handle', 'Kate', 'really', 'idea', 'other', 'parts', 'scene', 'really', 'take', 'brutality', 're-inject', 'humor', 'just', 'small', 'example', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'such', 'examples', 'play', 'where', 'delivery', 'lines', 'expressions', 'staging', 'are', 'pure', 'genius', 'love', 'version', ""n't"", 'destroy', 'original', 'text', 'making', 'PC', 'Rather', 'believe', 'Kate', 'Petruchio', 'ultimately', 'love', 'other', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'better', 'Petruccio', 'Kate', 'better', 'version', 'play', 'Certainly', 'non-stop', 'screeching', 'Liz', 'Taylor', 'Zeffirelli', 'version', 'absolutely', 'match', 'Olster', 'performance', 'version']",The Taming of the Shrew Broadway Theatre Archive  VHS

573765,A2LHSABDHUIEYK,B000059PEZ,Interested Observer,"[4, 4]","This one is simply the best.  I have no problem at all choosing between this production and the Burton/Taylor movie.  This one wins without a contest. Grab it while you can!William Ball's production remembers one thing that many productions forget: this is a comedy and it is supposed to be funny.  It is not literary scripture to be intoned in solemn reverence to the great Bard of Stratford on Avon.  To accomplish this Ball makes a robust and ribald presentation based on the Commedia dell'arte, a broad and slapstick style that was current in Shakespeare's time.  The result is baldly, not subtly, hilarious.More subtle is the direction of the story itself.  Thoughtful direction, brilliantly delivered by the Marc Singer as Petruchio and Fredi Olster as Kate, is used to show Petruchio's increasing regard for Kate as the play proceeds. Even in the final scene it is clear that when he calls for Kate to come, after the other two wives have refused, that he is uncertain of the outcome.  Thus he is surprised, delighted and gratified when she does come, not gloating in overbearing male chauvinist triumph. This goes a long way toward making modern sense of the now problematic text about the roles of men and women, and the way she is brought to heel. (I find the middle section of the play where the shrew taming is accomplished, with methods that include food and sleep deprivation, has an uncomfortable resemblance to modern day brainwashing and torture. It leaves today's audience with the question: Is it love? Or is it Stockholm syndrome?  The very idea of such obedience is now controversial, even without the issue of abuse.  This presents a huge challenge for the present day production of Taming of the Shrew as anything but a theatrical museum piece.) Portrayed in this way, Petruchio is not a just a swaggering playboy out to cash in a dowry, but someone who might be worthy of the obedience he expects, and is coming to value the strength and honesty of Kate and its advantages over the coquettish, spoiled personalities of Bianca and her friends back in Padua. Thus this production is both traditional and modern without upending the play entirely in some PC ""re-visioning"" or gender-bent re-interpretation.  And most of all, it is funny.I saw it one time on PBS before the VCR and I thought I would never see it again, and worse, nor would anybody else leaving Zeffirelli's text mangled showpiece or much duller ""official"" versions as the only ones available.  I was overjoyed to find that it had been released on DVD in  along with many other similar programs that I enjoyed on PBS (do not let the politicians kill PBS!) many years ago that are also in this Broadway Theater Archives series.The Burton/Taylor/Zeffirelli version is just a movie.  It places showcasing its marquee power, plush production, and cinematography far above the play itself. It seems like about half the play is omitted outright and the rest, even some the most prominent and well known speeches are hacked up.  (Compare the play or this production to the ""streamlining"" done to the final scene in the movie. Completely unedited presentations of any Shakespeare are rare, and for good reason, but this was too much.)  Seeing both in close sequence reminded me just how good this one is, and how much the other suffers after subtracting the contribution of movie stardom and lush production.",5,Best production on video.,1219104000,"08 19, 2008",2008,3387,"['one', 'simply', 'best', 'have', 'problem', 'choosing', 'production', 'Burton/Taylor', 'movie', 'one', 'contest', 'Grab', 'can', 'William', 'Ball', 'production', 'one', 'thing', 'many', 'productions', 'forget', 'comedy', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'not', 'literary', 'scripture', 'be', 'intoned', 'solemn', 'reverence', 'great', 'Bard', 'Stratford', 'Avon', 'accomplish', 'Ball', 'robust', 'ribald', 'presentation', 'based', 'Commedia', ""dell'arte"", 'broad', 'slapstick', 'style', 'was', 'current', 'Shakespeare', 'time', 'result', 'baldly', 'not', 'subtly', 'hilarious.More', 'subtle', 'direction', 'story', 'Thoughtful', 'direction', 'brilliantly', 'delivered', 'Marc', 'Singer', 'Petruchio', 'Fredi', 'Olster', 'Kate', 'used', 'show', 'Petruchio', 'increasing', 'regard', 'Kate', 'play', 'proceeds', 'Even', 'final', 'scene', 'clear', 'when', 'Kate', 'come', 'other', 'two', 'wives', 'have', 'refused', 'uncertain', 'outcome', 'Thus', 'surprised', 'delighted', 'gratified', 'when', 'come', 'not', 'gloating', 'overbearing', 'male', 'chauvinist', 'triumph', 'long', 'way', 'making', 'modern', 'sense', 'now', 'problematic', 'text', 'roles', 'men', 'women', 'way', 'brought', 'heel', 'find', 'middle', 'section', 'play', 'where', 'shrew', 'taming', 'accomplished', 'methods', 'include', 'food', 'sleep', 'deprivation', 'uncomfortable', 'resemblance', 'modern', 'day', 'brainwashing', 'torture', 'today', 'audience', 'question', 'love', 'Stockholm', 'syndrome', 'very', 'idea', 'such', 'obedience', 'now', 'controversial', 'even', 'issue', 'abuse', 'huge', 'challenge', 'present', 'day', 'production', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'anything', 'theatrical', 'museum', 'piece', 'Portrayed', 'way', 'Petruchio', 'not', 'just', 'swaggering', 'playboy', 'cash', 'dowry', 'someone', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'worthy', 'obedience', 'coming', 'value', 'strength', 'honesty', 'Kate', 'advantages', 'coquettish', 'spoiled', 'personalities', 'Bianca', 'friends', 'back', 'Padua', 'Thus', 'production', 'traditional', 'modern', 'upending', 'play', 'entirely', 'PC', 're-visioning', 'gender-bent', 're-interpretation', 'most', 'funny.I', 'saw', 'one', 'time', 'PBS', 'VCR', 'thought', 'would', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'worse', 'would', 'anybody', 'else', 'leaving', 'Zeffirelli', 'text', 'mangled', 'showpiece', 'much', 'duller', 'official', 'versions', 'only', 'ones', 'available', 'was', 'overjoyed', 'find', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'along', 'many', 'other', 'similar', 'programs', 'enjoyed', 'PBS', 'do', 'not', 'let', 'politicians', 'kill', 'PBS', 'many', 'years', 'are', 'also', 'Broadway', 'Theater', 'series.The', 'Burton/Taylor/Zeffirelli', 'version', 'just', 'movie', 'showcasing', 'marquee', 'power', 'plush', 'production', 'cinematography', 'far', 'play', 'play', 'omitted', 'outright', 'rest', 'even', 'most', 'prominent', 'well', 'known', 'speeches', 'are', 'hacked', 'up', 'Compare', 'play', 'production', 'streamlining', 'done', 'final', 'scene', 'movie', 'Completely', 'unedited', 'presentations', 'Shakespeare', 'are', 'rare', 'good', 'reason', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'Seeing', 'close', 'sequence', 'reminded', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'one', 'how', 'much', 'other', 'suffers', 'subtracting', 'contribution', 'movie', 'stardom', 'lush', 'production']",The Taming of the Shrew Broadway Theatre Archive  VHS

However, in Shakespeare's day, acting was considered a lewd and lowly profession, so don't be surprised at the lewd and lascivious nature of this production.The one inconsistency with this play is that Katherina ends her famous monologue on the duty of women with a wink and a nod, which is a modern convention.  Before the early or mid 1900s (I can't remember which), this play was not performed with a wink and a nod downplaying its most sexist themes.  This wink and nod make these sexist themes less offensive and more palatable to a modern audience, so the choice to use them was based on the era in which this play was produced, not when it was first written and performed.Aside from the wink and nod, this is probably the most authentic version of Taming of the Shrew available for mass consumption.

The situation seems hopeless, until the right man shows up on the scene (played by Marc Singer) with a perfect strategy and here the fun really begins.The setting and the costumes are intended to replicate to a certain extent commedia dell'arte and everyone is dressed in some form of white costume with red accents - except for delightful Marc Singer, naked to the waist, in tights ... together with all the verbal and behavioral persuasion used to tame a shrew, the way he looks helps, too, to make his task easier (he has half of the job done just showing up half-naked).The entire persuasion strategy is exquisitely calculated - whatever he does is done only to the point of obtaining a desired effect, never losing control of the situation or of his objective - and throughout the entire process he comes through as a loving husband who only has his wife's best interests at heart.",5,Marc Singer gives a sparkle to the play,1102291200,"12 6, 2004",2004,1237,"['commedy', 'two', 'unmarried', 'daughters', 'wealthy', 'Italian', 'merchant', 'are', 'many', 'suitors', 'interested', 'courting', 'younger', 'docile', 'daughter', 'father', 'older', 'one', 'marry', 'first', 'problem', 'hot-tempered', 'unwilling', 'marry', 'obnoxious', 'anyone', 'who', 'even', 'attempt', 'court', 'situation', 'hopeless', 'right', 'man', 'up', 'scene', 'played', 'Marc', 'Singer', 'perfect', 'strategy', 'here', 'fun', 'really', 'begins.The', 'setting', 'costumes', 'are', 'intended', 'replicate', 'certain', 'extent', 'commedia', ""dell'arte"", 'everyone', 'dressed', 'form', 'white', 'costume', 'red', 'accents', 'delightful', 'Marc', 'Singer', 'naked', 'waist', 'tights', 'together', 'verbal', 'behavioral', 'persuasion', 'used', 'tame', 'shrew', 'way', 'too', 'make', 'task', 'easier', 'half', 'job', 'done', 'just', 'showing', 'up', 'half-naked', '.The', 'entire', 'persuasion', 'strategy', 'exquisitely', 'calculated', 'whatever', 'done', 'only', 'point', 'obtaining', 'desired', 'effect', 'never', 'losing', 'control', 'situation', 'objective', 'entire', 'process', 'through', 'loving', 'husband', 'who', 'only', 'wife', 'best', 'interests', 'heart']",The Taming of the Shrew Broadway Theatre Archive  VHS

Bernabo,"[27, 28]","I always liked the Zeferrelli film version of &quot;The Taming of Shrew&quot; with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton for reasons largely having little to do with the text of Shakespeare's play.  That film is very much a visual treat, as you would expect from Zeferrelli, but I find I have a much better appreciation for the text from this ACT version which strips everything down to the dialogue and sends the actors out to do battle.The impetus for this production is that the play is performed in the style of &quot;commedia dell'arte,&quot; an Italian theatrical form that flourished throughout Europe from the 16th to 17th centuries (well, &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; is set in Italy and the play was written during the 16th century, so it makes sense).  This approach emphasizes ensemble acting and celebrates rich verbal humor, without disdaining physical comedy.  However, do not expect to be seeing masks, because while that was key to &quot;commedia dell'arte&quot; where the mask was more important than the player because of the standardized characters (e.g., capitano, harlequin, pantaloon, etc.), this is not that traditional a performance.  Of course, this does emphasize how much &quot;Shrew&quot; is like a traditional &quot;commedia dell'arte&quot;; you certainly have Zanni, the madcap servants, as well as the young couple whose love is thwarted by their parents with Bianca and Lucentio.Watching this play certainly emphasizes the production over the individual performances.  However, you will be allowed to indulge a momentary pause when you notice that it is Marc Singer (&quot;The Beastmaster&quot;) who is play Petruchio.  Harry Hamlin is recognizable in a bit part, but the rest of the cast has remained unknown, which, again, emphasizes the script more than the actors.  Even Fredi Olster, who plays Katherina, has disappeared except for choice roles like the Woman in Hallway in &quot;Burglar&quot; and Judge Winters on &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger.&quot;The bottom line is that if I was interested in turning young students onto Shakespeare, in terms of the love of language and the joy in word play, then this ACT production of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; from the Broadway Theater Archive would be the one I would show them.  Certainly the broad style of the comedy will drive home the various nuances of the Bard's language (although I agree with those critics who say Shakespeare is responsible for the main Petruchio-Katherina plot line and not the Bianca-Lucentio sub-plot).  Besides, they will probably be excited to see the Beastmaster in action again.",5,A high energy commedia dell'arte production of &quot;Shrew&quot;,1035676800,"10 27, 2002",2002,2605,"['always', 'liked', 'Zeferrelli', 'film', 'version', 'quot', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'quot', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'reasons', 'largely', 'having', 'little', 'do', 'text', 'Shakespeare', 'play', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'visual', 'treat', 'would', 'expect', 'Zeferrelli', 'find', 'have', 'much', 'better', 'appreciation', 'text', 'ACT', 'version', 'everything', 'down', 'dialogue', 'actors', 'out', 'do', 'battle.The', 'impetus', 'production', 'play', 'performed', 'style', 'quot', ""dell'arte"", 'quot', 'Italian', 'theatrical', 'form', 'flourished', 'Europe', '16th', '17th', 'centuries', 'well', 'quot', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'quot', 'set', 'Italy', 'play', 'was', 'written', '16th', 'century', 'sense', 'approach', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'celebrates', 'rich', 'verbal', 'humor', 'disdaining', 'physical', 'comedy', 'However', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'be', 'seeing', 'masks', 'was', 'key', 'quot', ""dell'arte"", 'quot', 'where', 'mask', 'was', 'more', 'important', 'player', 'standardized', 'characters', 'e.g.', 'capitano', 'harlequin', 'pantaloon', 'etc', 'not', 'traditional', 'performance', 'course', 'emphasize', 'how', 'much', 'quot', 'Shrew', 'quot', 'traditional', 'quot', ""dell'arte"", 'quot', 'certainly', 'have', 'Zanni', 'madcap', 'servants', 'as', 'well', 'young', 'couple', 'love', 'thwarted', 'parents', 'Bianca', 'Lucentio.Watching', 'play', 'certainly', 'production', 'individual', 'performances', 'However', 'will', 'be', 'allowed', 'indulge', 'momentary', 'pause', 'when', 'notice', 'Marc', 'Singer', 'quot', 'Beastmaster', 'quot', 'who', 'play', 'Petruchio', 'Harry', 'Hamlin', 'recognizable', 'bit', 'part', 'rest', 'cast', 'remained', 'unknown', 'again', 'script', 'more', 'actors', 'Even', 'Fredi', 'Olster', 'who', 'Katherina', 'disappeared', 'choice', 'roles', 'Woman', 'Hallway', 'quot', 'Burglar', 'quot', 'Judge', 'Winters', 'quot', 'Walker', 'Texas', 'Ranger.', 'quot', 'bottom', 'line', 'was', 'interested', 'turning', 'young', 'students', 'Shakespeare', 'terms', 'love', 'language', 'joy', 'word', 'play', 'then', 'ACT', 'production', 'quot', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'quot', 'Broadway', 'Theater', 'Archive', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'would', 'show', 'Certainly', 'broad', 'style', 'comedy', 'will', 'drive', 'home', 'various', 'nuances', 'Bard', 'language', 'agree', 'critics', 'who', 'say', 'Shakespeare', 'responsible', 'main', 'Petruchio-Katherina', 'plot', 'line', 'not', 'Bianca-Lucentio', 'sub-plot', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'excited', 'see', 'Beastmaster', 'action', 'again']",The Taming of the Shrew Broadway Theatre Archive  VHS

Grossack,"[3, 3]","The Taming of the Shrew is not my favorite Shakespeare play - too politically incorrect! - but this is one of my favorite versions of any Shakespeare.  The stage is set in a plain manner, making no attempt to gloss over the fact that it is, in fact, a play - as opposed to dazzling and distracting the audience with background.  The spareness of the set, even the choice of the colors used for the costumes, keep the attention focused on the actors and Shakespeare's amazing language.The ascetic nature of the set is more than made up for by the exuberance of the actors and the exaggerated, but breathtaking choreography.  Lines come to life in a way that make you laugh aloud: ""Methinks you walk like a stranger,"" and ""My eyes were dazzled by the -- sun?"" are two memorable examples.  Grumio's halitosis, Bianca's sighs, Hortensio and the broken lute - to say nothing of the cheers that erupt whenever Padua is mentioned - these all are instances of the marvelous directing and the cast's ability to manage the split-second pace.A special tribute must be made to Marc Singer, who, as Petruchio, carries much of the play - as well as many of the other actors! He's extremely easy on the eye, and is explicitly appreciated by Fredi Olster in her role as the cursed Katerina.  She brings depth to her role, too, by the expression in her eyes, and you realize that during the course of the play she has tamed Mad Petruchio.As a DVD, there's not much offered in the way of special features.  But don't let that stop you from buying it!
