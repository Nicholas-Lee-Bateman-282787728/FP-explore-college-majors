805680,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0001HAHNM,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[118, 122]","Set in 90 AD, this film gives us insight into the lives of Christians who lived under the domination of Roman rule. Emperor Domitian (played with ample dementia by Bruce Payne) is in power, and his goal is to kill every living Christian who does not denounce God and give allegiance to Domitian alone, who has claimed himself god over all things.The imagery in this film is fantastic; Giovanni Galasso's cinematography is full of rich color, and a feast for the eyes; there are portions that are like liquid works of art, and I never tire of watching them, in fact, several viewings are needed to fully appreciate the creative magic of the photography. The brilliance of the palette reminds me of the heyday of Technicolor, with its opulent reds, greens and blues.The great Richard Harris is the apostle John, and it is one of his last appearances on film. Harris, who was so terrific starring in the cable television Bible Series production of ""Abraham"" in 1994, has less to do in this film, but with his weathered face and fabulous voice is wonderful. The attractive cast that surrounds him is excellent, with Vittoria Belvedere, Benjamin Sadler and Ian Duncan in the leads. Christian Kohlund is also impressive as Quintus Maximus.The lavish sets and authentic looking costumes lend credibility to a film that is largely about John's visions,  and are a good contrast to the ""New heaven and new earth"" of the beautiful, light-filled revelations given to the apostle.Kudos to director Raffaele Mertes who directs with the eye of an artist (he was cinematographer for seven of the other Bible Series productions and director for ""Esther""), and another great talent from the same series of films is the award-winning composer Monsignor Marco Frisina, who for this production was also Biblical Consultant, as well as giving us an atmospheric, lovely soundtrack.Total running time is 96 minutes, for this marvelous telling of the apostle John's final days on the island of Patmos.",5,a feast for the eyes and food for the soul,1089590400,"07 12, 2004",2004,1977,"['Set', '90', 'AD', 'film', 'insight', 'lives', 'Christians', 'who', 'lived', 'domination', 'Roman', 'rule', 'Emperor', 'Domitian', 'played', 'ample', 'dementia', 'Bruce', 'Payne', 'power', 'goal', 'kill', 'living', 'Christian', 'who', 'not', 'denounce', 'God', 'give', 'allegiance', 'Domitian', 'alone', 'who', 'claimed', 'god', 'things.The', 'imagery', 'film', 'fantastic', 'Giovanni', 'Galasso', 'cinematography', 'full', 'rich', 'color', 'feast', 'eyes', 'are', 'portions', 'are', 'liquid', 'works', 'art', 'never', 'tire', 'watching', 'fact', 'several', 'viewings', 'are', 'needed', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'creative', 'magic', 'photography', 'brilliance', 'palette', 'heyday', 'Technicolor', 'opulent', 'reds', 'greens', 'blues.The', 'great', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'apostle', 'John', 'one', 'last', 'appearances', 'film', 'Harris', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'terrific', 'starring', 'cable', 'television', 'Bible', 'Series', 'production', 'Abraham', '1994', 'less', 'do', 'film', 'weathered', 'face', 'fabulous', 'voice', 'wonderful', 'attractive', 'cast', 'excellent', 'Vittoria', 'Belvedere', 'Benjamin', 'Sadler', 'Ian', 'Duncan', 'leads', 'Christian', 'Kohlund', 'also', 'impressive', 'Quintus', 'Maximus.The', 'lavish', 'sets', 'authentic', 'looking', 'costumes', 'lend', 'credibility', 'film', 'largely', 'John', 'visions', 'are', 'good', 'contrast', 'New', 'heaven', 'new', 'earth', 'beautiful', 'light-filled', 'revelations', 'given', 'apostle.Kudos', 'director', 'Raffaele', 'Mertes', 'who', 'eye', 'artist', 'was', 'cinematographer', 'seven', 'other', 'Bible', 'Series', 'productions', 'director', 'Esther', 'great', 'talent', 'same', 'series', 'films', 'award-winning', 'composer', 'Monsignor', 'Marco', 'Frisina', 'who', 'production', 'was', 'also', 'Biblical', 'Consultant', 'as', 'well', 'giving', 'atmospheric', 'lovely', 'soundtrack.Total', 'running', 'time', '96', 'minutes', 'marvelous', 'telling', 'apostle', 'John', 'final', 'days', 'island', 'Patmos']",The Apocalypse

They only have about 15 minutes of Revelation sprinkled throughout the film, usually just John witnessing events beginning in Heaven, up in the clouds.Once you get past the disappointment of anemic scriptural content, then you can still enjoy the acting and sets. The actor playing John is SUPERB and has the classic look that you would expect of an elderly apostle.This film DOES do a good job of showing the audience what the life of John the Apostle could (?) have looked like during his final years in prison, where he wrote the book of REVELATION.They introduce a small group of faithful followers who surround John, even in prison, and a Roman spy sent to find out who is still out there ""turning the world upside-down,"" so to speak, by continuing to write scripture for the early scattered churches in different cities.THE APOCALYPSE does a good job of showing the era and living conditions, and the main actors are all likeable, but there is too much NON-scriptural story content, when I would have prefered 90 minutes of a dramatized telling from the actual Bible book of Revelation.This movie is okay, but there are much better Bible films on DVD to be had for the money.

The film starts out by setting the stage - how the Roman Caesar saw himself, as a god. And as such he goes on a rampage to eliminate the 'competition', and in particular he is very concerned about the status of John and rumours being spread about this apostle.The film unfolds at two levels simultaneously: Firstly there is the natural level where John is a prisoner on the Isle of Patmos and the believers are desperate to communicate with him. Secondly there is the spiritual level, where at nights John is transported to heaven and other various locations to receive messages from the Lord.John then dictates these messages to his fellow scribe, the parchments are then sent out to the Christians when supplies come into the prison. Ultimately, it is the collection of these prachments that will constitite the Book of Revelation. The vistual interpretations of heaven and what takes place as the 7 seals are each broken is turn are well portrayed.What this picture captures very beautifully is the humility and love that the apostle expresses in the face of his cruel captors. He demonstrates by his life what it really means to be a Christian. Such values have been lost in the church today. Richard Harris does an excellent job.The entire book of Revelation is not captured in the film; however Jesus is seen in his full glory ... with his face only shown as a bright shining light ... this is a nice touch.

There are just way too many movies nowadays that glorify lifestyles and actions that simply shouldn't be glorified.When I stumbled across this movie, I decided to watch it because I had already read the book of Revelations. This movie sounded interesting, and so I gave it a try.This movie tells the story of the last years of John the Apostle. John was the youngest of Jesus's disciples and the only one who wasn't martyred. John is also the only one who lived to a very old age (He didn't die until he was in his 90s).Most of the story takes place on the Island of Patmos where John lived out his last days in exile. During this time he gets the visions he writes about in the book of Revelations.What I liked so much about this movie, other than Richard Harris as John who is a very fine actor, is the very human face it puts on the events in the Bible. Many people don't want to believe that the Bible is true. Instead, they want to believe that it is a book of myths and fairy tales even though much modern scholarship has proven much of the Bible to be historically accurate.There are many scenes in this movie that will bring tears to your eyes, especially if you are a Christian. When John gives his food to another prisoner to replace what a guard had thrown out, it's deeply moving to see the compassion of someone who has so little materially and yet has everything spiritually.The whole experience really deepened my faith and softened my heart to want to be more compassionate to other people. It brought into perspective the lessons Jesus was trying to teach us. It really doesn't matter what the world thinks about you. What's important is how God sees you and your relationship with Him.Although the Biblical references to the Book of Revelations, John's visions, are hard to understand unless you've studied Revelations, they are still visually appealing, and will arouse your curiousity about what Revelations really says.This is both a very spiritually and emotionally appealing movie that accurately follows both what the Bible teaches and what history says about the persecutions of Christians at this time, as well as the incarceration of John.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a movie that will touch your heart and make you think.",5,A Part of Bible History That's Rarely Talked About But Should Be,1240963200,"04 29, 2009",2009,2333,"['Christian', 'really', 'hard', 'find', 'good', 'movies', 'watch', 'are', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'nowadays', 'glorify', 'lifestyles', 'actions', 'simply', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'glorified.When', 'stumbled', 'movie', 'decided', 'watch', 'had', 'already', 'read', 'book', 'Revelations', 'movie', 'sounded', 'interesting', 'so', 'gave', 'try.This', 'movie', 'story', 'last', 'years', 'John', 'Apostle', 'John', 'was', 'youngest', 'Jesus', 'disciples', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'martyred', 'John', 'also', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'lived', 'very', 'old', 'age', 'did', ""n't"", 'die', 'was', '90s', '.Most', 'story', 'place', 'Island', 'Patmos', 'where', 'John', 'lived', 'out', 'last', 'days', 'exile', 'time', 'visions', 'book', 'Revelations.What', 'liked', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'other', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'John', 'who', 'very', 'fine', 'actor', 'very', 'human', 'face', 'events', 'Bible', 'Many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'believe', 'Bible', 'true', 'Instead', 'want', 'believe', 'book', 'myths', 'fairy', 'tales', 'even', 'much', 'modern', 'scholarship', 'proven', 'much', 'Bible', 'be', 'historically', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'movie', 'will', 'bring', 'tears', 'eyes', 'especially', 'are', 'Christian', 'When', 'John', 'food', 'prisoner', 'replace', 'what', 'guard', 'had', 'thrown', 'out', 'deeply', 'moving', 'see', 'compassion', 'someone', 'who', 'so', 'little', 'materially', 'yet', 'everything', 'spiritually.The', 'whole', 'experience', 'really', 'deepened', 'faith', 'softened', 'heart', 'want', 'be', 'more', 'compassionate', 'other', 'people', 'brought', 'perspective', 'lessons', 'Jesus', 'was', 'trying', 'teach', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'what', 'world', 'What', 'important', 'how', 'God', 'relationship', 'Him.Although', 'Biblical', 'references', 'Book', 'Revelations', 'John', 'visions', 'are', 'hard', 'understand', ""'ve"", 'studied', 'Revelations', 'are', 'still', 'visually', 'appealing', 'will', 'arouse', 'curiousity', 'what', 'Revelations', 'really', 'very', 'spiritually', 'emotionally', 'appealing', 'movie', 'accurately', 'what', 'Bible', 'teaches', 'what', 'history', 'persecutions', 'Christians', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'incarceration', 'John.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'movie', 'will', 'touch', 'heart', 'make', 'think']",The Apocalypse

These believers try to maintain their faith in Christ when Emperor Domitian proclaims himself to be God and gives an ultimatum for Christians to worship him or die. The believers in Ephesus send one of their female members to seek out John (played by Richard Harris) at the island of Patmos to receive messages from God and to bring them back to the church. John receives several visions which comfort the believers.  You will see truncated visions from the book of Revelation (the Lamb opening the scroll, the seven seals, the great multitude, the seven trumpet blasts, and the woman fleeing from the dragon), with a little bit of explanation thrown with it.Don't expect a full-blown picture of the Apocalypse, but for what it is, a historical fictionalized account of what the believers were going through when Revelation is written to them, it is really good.  Richard Harris does a great job of portraying the apostle John.  If you like Richard Harris, you'll also enjoy his portrayal of Abraham in the Bible collection series (which this movie is a part of).

Harris plays the Apostle John, the last surviving witness of the Passion of Jesus Christ.  In the year 90 A.D., John is now living in exile on the island of Patmos.  The Roman Emperor Domitian declares himself to be God and issues an ultimatum to all Christians living within the Empire: They must renounce their true God and worship Domitian, or die.  During this time, John begins to have the Apocalyptic visions which become the basis for the Bible's book of Revelation.  Harris turns in a great performance as John during the last years of his life.  He is also backed by a fine supporting cast which includes Vittoria Belvedere, Benjamin Sadler, Erol Sander, Ian Duncan and Christian Kohlund.  ""The Apocalypse"" gives us an interesting look at the Apostle John toward the end of his life, and an equally interesting look at the kind of persecution the early Christians went through.

805701,A3NAK0QG32XFKL,B0001HAHNM,"Tefilo de Jess ""Vivificat's blogmaster""","[23, 24]","Folks, The Apocalypse is a retelling of the book of Revelation as received by the Apostle John, produced by Italian Radio TV. It is a very Catholic movie, as most of the consultants were Catholic and at least one Orthodox and it shows. But it is not blatantly Catholic, so basically any Christian will enjoy watching the movie.You all know Richard Harris. His filmography is quite extensive and includes The Guns of Navarone (1961), The Bible (1966) titled The Bible... In the Beginning (in USA) & La Bibbia (in Italy), A Man Called Horse (1970), and two Harry Potter movies. The Apocalypse is his last movie and he delivers a powerful performance as John the Apostle. There's something about his raspy voice, which sounds old yet vital, imbued with authority and compassion that moves the viewer to listen carefully. All his actions seemed to very deliberate but not forced, very natural, without conceit. What an actor!Actors Vittoria Belvedere and Benjamin Sadler play ""Irene"" and ""Valerius"" respectively, in a supporting role. Theirs is the ""mandatory love affair"" that we often see in these kinds of movie, but I assure that this affair is not vulgar, nor does it eclipse the plot. Irene had met the Apostle John when she was younger and now she's sent by the Bishop of Ephesus to track the Apostle in order to ensure the authenticity of the Apocalypse. Valerius is a Roman officer whose parents were Christians, having been adopted by a Roman general. He infiltrates the Ephesian Church, his mission being to locate the Apostle John, but he has second thoughts and...well, watch the movie.The movie's strong points lie on its special effects. They carry the story well, without overwhelming it. John tells the story, and you see what he sees. Although the director-Rafaelle Mertes-threaded some current events into the movie to illustrate its prophetic aspects-including scenes from 9-11 to picture ""war""-he does it without forcing the biblical text into modern fulfillments. What the director achieves is a correspondence of ideas. This is no ""rapture"" movie a la Left Behind..The Apocalypse is a part of the The Bible Collection produced by Italian Radio-Television. This is the kind of movie that we must support.
