534097,A2L5XWA1DRCFAH,B00003CXRG,Akethan,"[1, 1]",This movie was powerful in its visual &amp; emotional moments. The spoken English moments were muddled and difficult to follow. The movie was better served in Spanish with subtitles. It was a beautiful movie which began in the early 40's at the dawn of Castro's Revolution. It was very sad to watch a joyful &amp; colorful people become ruined and terrified of their government. They turned each other in at any point to save their own skins. The soundtrack was perfectly selected and paced througout the movie. Art and beauty were suspect and hunted out for destruction as enemies of the Revolution.The excerpts from his books will have me going to the library to check out a few titles - BEFORE NIGHT FALLS and SINGING FROM THE WELL both sound like good reads.Johnny Depp's dual stints as two very different characters was surprising and effective. Javier Bardem was charming - and full of pain. His final escape from Cuba to the US is briefly satisfying as the movie moves right into his demise as AIDS claims his life.Give this one a whirl - it is well worth it.,4,Joy in Ruin.,1005523200,"11 12, 2001",2001,1066,"['movie', 'was', 'powerful', 'visual', 'amp', 'emotional', 'moments', 'spoken', 'English', 'moments', 'were', 'muddled', 'difficult', 'follow', 'movie', 'was', 'better', 'served', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'was', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'began', 'early', '40', 'dawn', 'Castro', 'Revolution', 'was', 'very', 'sad', 'watch', 'joyful', 'amp', 'colorful', 'people', 'become', 'ruined', 'terrified', 'government', 'turned', 'other', 'point', 'save', 'own', 'skins', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'perfectly', 'selected', 'paced', 'movie', 'Art', 'beauty', 'were', 'suspect', 'hunted', 'out', 'destruction', 'enemies', 'Revolution.The', 'excerpts', 'books', 'will', 'have', 'going', 'library', 'check', 'out', 'few', 'titles', 'NIGHT', 'FALLS', 'SINGING', 'FROM', 'THE', 'WELL', 'sound', 'good', 'reads.Johnny', 'Depp', 'dual', 'stints', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'characters', 'was', 'surprising', 'effective', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'was', 'charming', 'full', 'pain', 'final', 'escape', 'Cuba', 'US', 'briefly', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'right', 'demise', 'AIDS', 'life.Give', 'one', 'whirl', 'well', 'worth']",N/A
534098,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B00003CXRG,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[1, 2]","Julian Schnabel's ""Before Night Falls"" is an artistic look at the life of gay Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas. While many biopics resort to cliches about the Suffering Artist, Schnabel paints the picture of a troubled poet,who is at once a hero and a libertine, a freedom fighter and a victim of his own success. Schnabel's background as an artist makes ""Before Night Falls"" a feast for the eyes as well as the ears (there are excerpts of Arenas' poetry read aloud)Javier Bardem is luminous as Reinaldo Arenas, showing him as a troubled genius who lived and died on his own terms. His character is deeply sympathetic,and his death from assisted suicide/AIDS is wrenching to watch. His life asks questions about what it means to be free. Arenas took many handsome lovers-Olivier Martinez is wonderful as Arenas' ex-lover who stays beside his side as he dies from AIDS-and in the end,chooses what he deems a ""death with dignity."" What does it mean to be free?Sean Penn stars as a peasant farmer who recruits Arenas into Fidel Castro's revolution,a revolution that quickly devolves into repression. Johnny Depp has a dual role-as a freedom-loving drag queen who bonds with Arenas in prison- as well as a cruel,repressed torturer.""Before Night Falls"" is a poetic film. It's one of Javier Bardem's early achievements,and it's worth watching. Like a poem,it is open to interpretation,and it is beautiful.",3,A Poet's Twilight,1199404800,"01 4, 2008",2008,1393,"['Julian', 'Schnabel', 'Night', 'Falls', 'artistic', 'look', 'life', 'gay', 'Cuban', 'poet', 'Reinaldo', 'Arenas', 'many', 'biopics', 'resort', 'cliches', 'Suffering', 'Artist', 'Schnabel', 'picture', 'troubled', 'poet', 'who', 'once', 'hero', 'libertine', 'freedom', 'fighter', 'victim', 'own', 'success', 'Schnabel', 'background', 'artist', 'Night', 'Falls', 'feast', 'eyes', 'as', 'well', 'ears', 'are', 'excerpts', 'Arenas', 'poetry', 'read', 'aloud', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'luminous', 'Reinaldo', 'Arenas', 'showing', 'troubled', 'genius', 'who', 'lived', 'died', 'own', 'terms', 'character', 'deeply', 'sympathetic', 'death', 'assisted', 'suicide/AIDS', 'wrenching', 'watch', 'life', 'questions', 'what', 'be', 'free', 'Arenas', 'took', 'many', 'handsome', 'lovers-Olivier', 'Martinez', 'wonderful', 'Arenas', 'ex-lover', 'who', 'side', 'AIDS-and', 'end', 'what', 'death', 'dignity', 'What', 'mean', 'be', 'free', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'stars', 'peasant', 'farmer', 'who', 'Arenas', 'Fidel', 'Castro', 'revolution', 'revolution', 'quickly', 'repression', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'dual', 'role-as', 'freedom-loving', 'drag', 'queen', 'who', 'bonds', 'Arenas', 'prison-', 'as', 'well', 'cruel', 'repressed', 'torturer', 'Night', 'Falls', 'poetic', 'film', 'one', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'early', 'achievements', 'worth', 'watching', 'poem', 'open', 'interpretation', 'beautiful']",N/A
534099,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXRG,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I admit to knowing nothing about poet Reinaldo Arenas before sitting down to watch `Before Night Falls'.  In fact, the only reason I had decided to give this a try in the first place was all the hype heaped upon Bardem's Oscar nominated performance.  At the time of my first viewing I was less than impressed.  Sure, it was a decent movie and I was wholly blown away by Bardem's heartbreaking performance, but in the end it just was not my cup of tea.  Recently I decided to revisit this film and upon a second viewing I must say that, while it still has it's detractors, it comes off very sincere and heartfelt; as if it meant something to everyone involved, and that feeling transcends the screen.`Before Night Falls' is adapted from Arenas memoir of the same name.  The film covers his life from birth till death (euthanasia) with an emotional pull that a lot of biopic's lack.  You can tell that director Julian Schnabel is longing to do justice to this man he obviously admires.  This emotional resonance can be attributed in large part to Bardem.  Javier Bardem (who recently was able to tag `Academy Award Winner' to his name) has always been an intriguing actor, one that slips into his roles and draws the audience in.  Of all his work (that I have seen, for I haven't seen everything) this is his finest performance.  He truly burrows beneath Arenas and causes his entire being to fester at the surface, uncovering the man he really was.This is of the utmost importance, because `Before Night Falls' biggest flaw is the fact that it's construction is rather choppy and incoherent, enough to really dampen ones grasp of their surroundings, and ultimately who Arenas was.  If Bardem had faltered in his performance in any way then the film could have possibly been lost to the audience.  This is possibly where Schnabel's admiration for his subject jeopardizes his tribute, for he tries so hard to show us everything that he doesn't take the time to flesh it all out for us.For instance; I had no idea that Arenas was suffering from AIDS.  Maybe I missed something, but as far as I could tell that was never clarified.  I had to look up Reinaldo Arenas on the internet to finally understand the last few minutes of the film.  I could have missed it, but that is just a small example of the bigger picture.Reinaldo Arenas lived a very interesting (albeit emotionally devastating) life.  The film follows it all; from his growing up in Cuba in poverty to being imprisoned during Castro's regime (his alternative lifestyle played a big factor there) to his exile to New York City before his death in 1990.  During his entire lifespan he was always writing.  He started at a young age writing poems (which infuriated his father) and moved onto writing material that garnered him many loyal followers to offset the many enemies.  All of this is displayed for us on the screen, but Schnabel doesn't take enough time to really embellish and help us to comprehend all that is going on.  This is one of those times when a film, although long, is not quite long enough.  Many have commented about it being too slow and meandering, but I think that if Schnabel had expanded his film thirty to forty minutes he could have given us a more coherent depiction of Arenas life, and that would have actually picked up the pace for we wouldn't be left confused.I can't for the life of me decide if this is due to O'Keefe and Carriles screenplay or Schnabel's direction; possibly both.Beyond the confusion though, lies one of the richest and most fulfilling performances I've seen in a long time, and one of the most endearing biographical performances maybe ever.  Bardem sinks so far into Arenas yet never gets lost in the films waves.  He actually works to steady those waves and draws out this mans life amidst the confusion.  He paints Arenas clearly, vividly and enjoyably.  We want to know him, we want to watch him, we want to cry for him.  Bardem is aided by a slew of supporting actors, from Olivier Martinez (who turns out possibly his finest performance to date) to Sean Penn and Johnny Depp who prove that no part is too small to make an impact.  In the end though, this film belongs to Bardem, and without him it would lose everything that makes it work.",4,Bardem's masterclass performance helps reign in the incoherencies...,1219363200,"08 22, 2008",2008,4256,"['admit', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'poet', 'Reinaldo', 'Arenas', 'sitting', 'down', 'watch', 'Night', 'Falls', 'fact', 'only', 'reason', 'had', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'first', 'place', 'was', 'hype', 'heaped', 'Bardem', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', 'time', 'first', 'viewing', 'was', 'less', 'impressed', 'Sure', 'was', 'decent', 'movie', 'was', 'wholly', 'blown', 'away', 'Bardem', 'heartbreaking', 'performance', 'end', 'just', 'was', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'Recently', 'decided', 'revisit', 'film', 'second', 'viewing', 'must', 'say', 'still', 'detractors', 'off', 'very', 'sincere', 'heartfelt', 'meant', 'something', 'everyone', 'involved', 'feeling', 'screen.', 'Night', 'Falls', 'adapted', 'Arenas', 'memoir', 'same', 'name', 'film', 'life', 'birth', 'till', 'death', 'euthanasia', 'emotional', 'pull', 'lot', 'biopic', 'lack', 'can', 'tell', 'director', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'longing', 'do', 'justice', 'man', 'obviously', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'large', 'part', 'Bardem', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'who', 'recently', 'was', 'able', 'tag', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Winner', 'name', 'always', 'been', 'intriguing', 'actor', 'one', 'roles', 'audience', 'work', 'have', 'seen', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'everything', 'finest', 'performance', 'truly', 'beneath', 'Arenas', 'entire', 'being', 'fester', 'surface', 'uncovering', 'man', 'really', 'utmost', 'importance', 'Night', 'Falls', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'fact', 'construction', 'rather', 'choppy', 'incoherent', 'enough', 'really', 'dampen', 'ones', 'grasp', 'surroundings', 'ultimately', 'who', 'Arenas', 'was', 'Bardem', 'had', 'faltered', 'performance', 'way', 'then', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'possibly', 'been', 'lost', 'audience', 'possibly', 'where', 'Schnabel', 'admiration', 'subject', 'tribute', 'so', 'hard', 'show', 'everything', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'flesh', 'out', 'us.For', 'instance', 'had', 'idea', 'Arenas', 'was', 'suffering', 'AIDS', 'Maybe', 'missed', 'something', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'never', 'clarified', 'had', 'look', 'up', 'Reinaldo', 'Arenas', 'internet', 'finally', 'understand', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'missed', 'just', 'small', 'example', 'bigger', 'picture.Reinaldo', 'Arenas', 'lived', 'very', 'interesting', 'emotionally', 'devastating', 'life', 'film', 'growing', 'up', 'Cuba', 'poverty', 'being', 'imprisoned', 'Castro', 'regime', 'alternative', 'lifestyle', 'played', 'big', 'factor', 'exile', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'death', '1990', 'entire', 'lifespan', 'was', 'always', 'writing', 'started', 'young', 'age', 'writing', 'poems', 'infuriated', 'father', 'moved', 'writing', 'material', 'garnered', 'many', 'loyal', 'followers', 'offset', 'many', 'enemies', 'displayed', 'screen', 'Schnabel', ""n't"", 'take', 'enough', 'time', 'really', 'embellish', 'help', 'comprehend', 'going', 'one', 'times', 'when', 'film', 'long', 'not', 'quite', 'long', 'enough', 'Many', 'have', 'commented', 'being', 'too', 'slow', 'meandering', 'think', 'Schnabel', 'had', 'expanded', 'film', 'thirty', 'forty', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'more', 'coherent', 'depiction', 'Arenas', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'actually', 'picked', 'up', 'pace', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'left', 'confused.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'life', 'decide', 'due', ""O'Keefe"", 'Carriles', 'screenplay', 'Schnabel', 'direction', 'possibly', 'confusion', 'one', 'richest', 'most', 'fulfilling', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'one', 'most', 'endearing', 'biographical', 'performances', 'maybe', 'ever', 'Bardem', 'sinks', 'so', 'far', 'Arenas', 'yet', 'never', 'lost', 'films', 'waves', 'actually', 'steady', 'waves', 'out', 'life', 'confusion', 'Arenas', 'clearly', 'vividly', 'enjoyably', 'want', 'know', 'want', 'watch', 'want', 'cry', 'Bardem', 'aided', 'slew', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Olivier', 'Martinez', 'who', 'out', 'possibly', 'finest', 'performance', 'date', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'who', 'prove', 'part', 'too', 'small', 'make', 'impact', 'end', 'film', 'Bardem', 'would', 'lose', 'everything', 'work']",N/A
534100,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00003CXRG,Andy Orrock,"[7, 11]","Julian Schnabel's astounding growth as a filmmaker is fully in evidence in this spectacular work.  &quot;Basquiat&quot; was, well, interesting but, let's face it, the title character was really not someone you felt like rooting for.  In contrast &quot;Before Night Falls&quot; is light-years ahead of it in terms of narrative, character development and vision.And Schnabel's #1 triumph is in chossing Javier Bardem to play Reinaldo Arenas.  This role was an amazing stretch for Bardem.  He essentially needed to learn two languages to play Arenas: Cuban-accented Spanish &amp; Cuban-accented English.  A background tip on Bardem: Go rent &quot;Live Flesh&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Carne Tremula&quot;).  Watch him in that movie and note the amazing contrast in...*everything* between these two roles.  This, my friends, is acting.  If anyone besides Bardem walks away with tonight's (3/25/2001) Oscar for Best Actor, it'll be a crime.As a good complement to the film, I strongly recommend that you read Phillip Weiss' piece about Schnabel in the 03/25/2001 New York Times Sunday Magazine.  Schnabel is the very definition of a larger-than-life character.  In the Independent Spirit Film awards yesterday, Bardem said of Schnabel &quot;I've never met anyone like you, my friend.

534104,A1IWR4FKPGE95C,B00003CXRG,Carlos Rodriguez,"[5, 6]","I love this movie and I totally agree with the critics that it was the best movie of 2000. As powerful and brilliant as this movie is, it is also extremely tragic in regards to all the terrible pain and suffering that Cuban author Reynaldo Arenas had to endured only because he was gay and was dead set against the Cuban government. For his beliefs he was jailed,ridicule and tortured in the most inhume way. This film is not easy to sit thru simply because of everything that Mr.Arenas went thru in his life. Javier Bardem who I had never heard of before this movie does and an excellent job in capturing Arenas charecteristics and mannerisms as well. He gave a remarkable performance and was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Actor but unfortunately did not win which I thought was very wrong but then again we all know how much politics and red tape are in the Oscars evey year and the actor or actress that you think deserves the award ends up not winning. It is also sad to see when Arenas becomes infected with HIV and in end dies in his New York aparment alongside his lover played by Olivier Martinez. One performance that I thought was wonderful although very short was that of actor Johnny Depp as the charamistic and flamboyant drag queen Bon Bon. He was also just as good playing a stern and cold Cuban government official who interrogates Reynaldo Arenas about his true feelings for the government. The scene where Johnny Depp's character is sitting down in a chair and looks at Arenas and starts touching his penis until he gets an erection is quite intense although too short to really notice but you really do see him touching himself. Overall this movie is amazing and I highly recommended to anyone who cares to know about what really goes on in Cuba when you are thrown in jail and tortured only because of your sexual orientation and your beliefs of free speech which ofcourse they are forbidden in Cuba. Another good reason to see this great movie is because the whole cast is wonderful and they all do an amazing job with their roles.

534106,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00003CXRG,C. B Collins Jr.,"[0, 0]","This is an artistic and visually bold film about the life of a gay talented poet and writer in the time of the Cuban Revolution. Javier Bardem is excellent as poet Reinaldo Arenas, a peasant child who becomes one of Cuba's great writers. The film takes us from the first days of the Cuban revolution to the dark days of totalitarian repression of all sexuality and creativity that is not condoned by the state.This is an excellent film, visually compelling with a narrative flow that is not smooth or consistent, but totally engaging all the same. The film artfully and entertainingly deals with the concept of whether and how the work of the artist and the actual life of the artist and then the later artistic depiction of the life of the artist are integrated. Schnabel does an excellent job of taking on this challenge, revealing the passages in the life of the artist that impact his work. Reinaldo Arenas made art from his life experiences but was able to maintain a surreal and absurdist aspect to the writing. Schnabel does this perfectly with his short collage like film-making, that is almost dream like with its entrances and exits of characters with little introduction or resolution. At first I thought this was a weakness of the film. Why were so many handsome men coming into Arenas' life and then leaving his life? Why were so many artists and writers his friends and allies and then they disappear?

Eventually forced to leave his country of birth, he resettled in New York City, but found it difficult, if not almost impossible, to cope with the pain of enforced exile.  He died in poverty.  Julian Schnabel's film is a visual feast, that traces the inspiration of Arenas' work to his childhood, growing up in a rural part of Cuba, and his relationship to his mother.  The film also suggests that the Castro regime was simultaneously repressive yet bohemian; this is what provided Arenas with much of the inspiration for his written work. Javier Bardem gives a memorable performance in the central role: through the use of tight close-ups, interspersed with black-and-white footage, director Schnabel emphasizes the importance of the local environment to Arenas' work.  Johnny Depp turns up in two cameo roles - one as a flagrant homosexual with a penchant for carrying information rolled up in his rectum, the other as a priapic prison guard trying to seduce yet repress Arenas during an interrogation. Sean Penn also has a small role as a revolutionary with an almost impenetrable Spanish accent.

The movie is based on the life of the dissident Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas, who was arrested and persecuted for engaging in a sex crime he did not commit. The source and inspiration for this movie are the poet's own memoirs published in 1994 under the same name as the film. Arenas was victimized in Kafkaesque  fashion and persecuted really for being gay and then having the gumption of protesting against the dictatorship and censorship in communist Cuba. Arenas finally fled Cuba during the turbulent Mariel Boatlift exodus of 1980, reaching the U.S. In American freedom, he continued his writings and work, pleading for freedom and liberty of expression in Cuba. Incredibly, in New York, where he settled, he was not supported in his work by the powerful American gay lobby, which chose to ignore his work and not to offend the Castro brothers.The film is an inspirational and artful masterpiece of cinema and deserves all the acclaim and plaudits the film received. Javier Bardem is finally being recognized as one of the greatest actors of this age and his performance here is as unforgettable as those subsequently dramatized in his films &#34;The Dancer Upstairs&#34; (2003) and &#34;Love in the Time of the Cholera&#34; (2008).

534111,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00003CXRG,Ed Uyeshima,"[7, 8]","Spanish-born actor Javier Bardem gives a staggering performance as Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas, which is lucky since he is in almost every frame of this film. In fact, he is the only constant in a biopic that sometimes feels disjointed and a bit long-winded, piecing together as it does the various episodes of Arenas' life sometimes sacrificing narrative flow in the process. At the same time, this is a powerfully moving film that displays the intensity of the post-revolution persecution experienced by Cubans more effectively than either Carlos Eire's memoir, ""Waiting for Snow in Havana"", or Hollywood confections such as Sydney Pollack's ""Havana"" or Richard Lester's ""Cuba"".Director Julian Schnabel, an artist himself who had previously directed a film about celebrity graffiti artist Jean Michael Basquiat, jumps back and forth like an abstract painter clarifying time periods by employing captions. We first see Arenas' birth in 1943 rural Cuba followed by glimpses of his poverty-stricken childhood. The story then moves forward to 1958 just before Castro rose to power and when Arenas becomes a revolutionary living in eastern Cuba. By 1964, as both an open gay and an intellectual, Arenas' writings have made him anathema to Castro's regime. For the next fifteen years, he shuttles back and forth between jail and freedom, and Arenas' story sheds much light on the difficult of living as a member of not just one but two minorities. In highly visual terms, Schnabel creates a striking tableau of life in Cuba that shows how getting out of Cuba was not an easy decision for natives to make, and Arenas, like most Cubans, makes it only begrudgingly at first. Imagine having to give up everything and fleeing. There is a vividly filmed sequence of an all-night party in an abandoned convent that houses a homemade hot-air balloon (shades of Jules Verne) by which one of them decides to escape selfishly and fatally. There are also some powerful scenes that show the humiliating torture Arenas experienced in prison ending finally with his escape and ultimately his departure from Cuba in the Mariel Harbor exodus of 1980 as one of Castro's ""undesirables"". Arenas then went into exile in New York living with his former lover, Lazaro. Sadly, soon after his arrival in America, he became ill with AIDS. The American sequence is short, allowing maximum time for the Cuba ordeal that makes up most of the film.The charismatic Bardem is superb capturing the emotional combustion in his character's life. There are a few guest appearances that somewhat undermine the story's realism, a nearly unrecognizable turn by Sean Penn as a Cuban peasant and in dual roles, Johnny Depp as a sadistic, closeted lieutenant and a transvestite named Bon Bon, who entertains prisoners in El Moro prison. And the use of English versus Spanish seems to be more at the director's discretion than the actual circumstances within scenes. But these are forgivable indulgences since Schnabel has made a valuable film telling a tale of Cuban struggle and hardship of a type that we surprisingly don't see that often in film. At 133 minutes, it does seem a bit overlong, but Arenas packed a full life in his 47 years. Most importantly, Schnabel successfully paints a picture depicting the influences behind Arenas' writing: his difficult childhood, his conflicted feelings for his mother, coming to terms with his sexuality, the revolution in Cuba, and the pain of being an outcast in his own country. As one might expect from a painter, Schnabel uses images as effectively as words to advance the story. Most are simple and quite beautiful, such as an early scene of a rainstorm that turns into a raging torrent of water, a later shot of countless prison inmates dangling bars of soap outside of their jail cells, or flashes of snow falling in New York as Arenas and his friend lie on a speeding convertible. Nevertheless, because Arenas, as a writer, dealt in words, it is impossible to tell his story without embracing this component, and Bardem's economical voiceovers attest to that aspect in a dramatically effective manner. Strongly recommended in spite of the relatively minor flaws. The DVD also includes an interesting French television interview with the real Arenas from 1983.",5,Superb Bardem Galvanizes Painterly Look at Reinaldo Arenas,1102809600,"12 12, 2004",2004,4265,"['Spanish-born', 'actor', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'staggering', 'performance', 'Cuban', 'poet', 'Reinaldo', 'Arenas', 'lucky', 'almost', 'frame', 'film', 'fact', 'only', 'constant', 'biopic', 'sometimes', 'disjointed', 'bit', 'long-winded', 'piecing', 'together', 'various', 'episodes', 'Arenas', 'life', 'sometimes', 'sacrificing', 'narrative', 'flow', 'process', 'same', 'time', 'powerfully', 'moving', 'film', 'intensity', 'post-revolution', 'persecution', 'experienced', 'Cubans', 'more', 'effectively', 'Carlos', 'Eire', 'memoir', 'Waiting', 'Snow', 'Havana', 'Hollywood', 'confections', 'such', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'Havana', 'Richard', 'Lester', 'Cuba', '.Director', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'artist', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'directed', 'film', 'celebrity', 'graffiti', 'artist', 'Jean', 'Michael', 'Basquiat', 'back', 'forth', 'abstract', 'painter', 'clarifying', 'time', 'periods', 'employing', 'captions', 'first', 'see', 'Arenas', 'birth', '1943', 'rural', 'Cuba', 'followed', 'glimpses', 'poverty-stricken', 'childhood', 'story', 'then', 'forward', '1958', 'just', 'Castro', 'rose', 'power', 'when', 'Arenas', 'revolutionary', 'living', 'eastern', 'Cuba', '1964', 'open', 'gay', 'intellectual', 'Arenas', 'writings', 'have', 'made', 'anathema', 'Castro', 'regime', 'next', 'fifteen', 'years', 'back', 'forth', 'jail', 'freedom', 'Arenas', 'story', 'sheds', 'much', 'light', 'difficult', 'living', 'member', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'two', 'minorities', 'highly', 'visual', 'terms', 'Schnabel', 'striking', 'tableau', 'life', 'Cuba', 'how', 'getting', 'Cuba', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'decision', 'natives', 'make', 'Arenas', 'most', 'Cubans', 'only', 'begrudgingly', 'first', 'Imagine', 'having', 'give', 'up', 'everything', 'fleeing', 'vividly', 'filmed', 'sequence', 'all-night', 'party', 'abandoned', 'convent', 'houses', 'homemade', 'hot-air', 'balloon', 'shades', 'Jules', 'Verne', 'one', 'escape', 'selfishly', 'fatally', 'are', 'also', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'show', 'humiliating', 'torture', 'Arenas', 'experienced', 'prison', 'ending', 'finally', 'escape', 'ultimately', 'departure', 'Cuba', 'Mariel', 'Harbor', 'exodus', '1980', 'one', 'Castro', 'undesirables', 'Arenas', 'then', 'went', 'exile', 'New', 'York', 'living', 'former', 'lover', 'Lazaro', 'Sadly', 'soon', 'arrival', 'America', 'became', 'ill', 'AIDS', 'American', 'sequence', 'short', 'allowing', 'maximum', 'time', 'Cuba', 'ordeal', 'up', 'most', 'film.The', 'charismatic', 'Bardem', 'superb', 'capturing', 'emotional', 'combustion', 'character', 'life', 'are', 'few', 'guest', 'appearances', 'somewhat', 'undermine', 'story', 'realism', 'nearly', 'unrecognizable', 'turn', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Cuban', 'peasant', 'dual', 'roles', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'sadistic', 'closeted', 'lieutenant', 'transvestite', 'named', 'Bon', 'Bon', 'who', 'prisoners', 'El', 'Moro', 'prison', 'use', 'English', 'versus', 'Spanish', 'be', 'more', 'director', 'discretion', 'actual', 'circumstances', 'scenes', 'are', 'forgivable', 'indulgences', 'Schnabel', 'made', 'valuable', 'film', 'telling', 'tale', 'Cuban', 'struggle', 'hardship', 'type', 'surprisingly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'often', 'film', '133', 'minutes', 'seem', 'bit', 'overlong', 'Arenas', 'packed', 'full', 'life', '47', 'years', 'Most', 'importantly', 'Schnabel', 'successfully', 'picture', 'depicting', 'influences', 'Arenas', 'writing', 'difficult', 'childhood', 'conflicted', 'feelings', 'mother', 'coming', 'terms', 'sexuality', 'revolution', 'Cuba', 'pain', 'being', 'outcast', 'own', 'country', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'painter', 'Schnabel', 'images', 'as', 'effectively', 'words', 'advance', 'story', 'Most', 'are', 'simple', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'such', 'early', 'scene', 'rainstorm', 'raging', 'torrent', 'water', 'later', 'shot', 'countless', 'prison', 'dangling', 'bars', 'soap', 'jail', 'cells', 'flashes', 'snow', 'falling', 'New', 'York', 'Arenas', 'friend', 'lie', 'speeding', 'convertible', 'Nevertheless', 'Arenas', 'writer', 'dealt', 'words', 'impossible', 'tell', 'story', 'embracing', 'component', 'Bardem', 'economical', 'voiceovers', 'attest', 'aspect', 'dramatically', 'effective', 'manner', 'Strongly', 'recommended', 'spite', 'relatively', 'minor', 'flaws', 'DVD', 'also', 'interesting', 'French', 'television', 'interview', 'real', 'Arenas', '1983']",N/A

534117,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00003CXRG,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","Visual artist Julian Schnabel was the perfect choice for bringing to the screen the richly colorful life and times of Cuban poet and novelist Reinaldo Arenas (1943-1990). BEFORE NIGHT FALLS began as a book, Arenas' memoir, translated and released in 1993: time has aged the eloquence of this memoir but has not marred the impact of the brilliance of the writing. Arenas wrote with a degree of truth and keen observation that makes his moments of antics with his characters like comic relief in a Shakespearean play. The screenplay was written by L&aacute;zaro G&oacute;mez Carriles, Cunningham O'Keefe and Julian Schnabel who with great homage to Arenas made his life as narrated by Arenas, in an inextricable mix of his memories, dreams, nightmares and pure fiction. He grew up as poor, naked illegitimate child, joined Castro's Cuban revolution and became an intellectual, employed in the public library. After discovering his gay sexuality, he soon shares in the regime's inconsistent persecution. His work and life become dominated by the mix of temptation, fear, betrayal and man hunting in both senses. Finally he makes it to Manhattan, only to get caught in another trap for which there is only one tragic escape in the end - his death from AIDS.Arenas had a gift of distilling Magical Realism, transforming even the radical ugliness of Castro's Cuba into the topical paradise so beloved by Cubans everywhere. This cinematic version lets the viewer experience that rich literary output of one of the most exciting writers of the last century. For example, `Walking along streets that collapse from crumbling sewers. Past buildings that you jump to avoid because they will fall on you. Past grim faces that size you up and sentence you. Past closed shops, closed markets, closed cinemas, closed parks, closed caf&eacute;s. Sometimes showing dusty signs, justifications: ""CLOSED FOR RENOVATION,"" ""CLOSED FOR REPAIRS."" What kind of repairs? When will these so-called renovations be finished? When at last will they begin? Closed... closed... closed... everything closed. I arrive, open the countless padlocks and run up the temporary stairs. There she is, waiting for me. I pull off the cover, and stare at her dusty, cold shape I clean of the dust and caress her. With my hand, delicately, I wipe clean her back, her base and her sides. In front of her, I feel desperate and happy. I run my fingers over her keyboard and suddenly it all starts up. With a tinkling sound the music begins, little by little, then faster; now full speed. Walls, trees, streets, cathedrals, faces and beaches. Cells, mini- cells, huge cells. Starry nights, bare feet, pines, clouds. Hundreds, thousands, millions of parrots. A stool, a climbing plant, they all answer my call, all come to me. The walls recede, the roof vanishes, and you float quite naturally. You float uprooted, dragged off, lifted high. Transported, immortalized, saved. Thanks to that subtle, continuous rhythm, that music, that incessant tap-tap.'Javier Bardem completely inhabits the poet that was Arenas - a performance so delicately nuanced that it remains one of the great moments in cinema.  He is ably supported by Olivier Martinez as L&aacute;zaro G&oacute;mez Carriles, and incidental roles by Johnny Depp, Sean Penn,  Diego Luna, Jerzy Skolimowski, Hector Babenco and a host of other fine actors. This is one of those films that remains a standard of the industry and certainly Javier Bardem will never be forgotten for his inhabiting the essence of what made Reinaldo Arenas a great writer.

It's beautifully written and paints a moving, bittersweet picture of life in the Carribean.That said, this film is not for everyone. It takes its time with telling its tale. The time is well spent as it gives you a chance to appreciate what Reinaldo Arenas ( the real-life Cuban author on whom the film is based ) was going through in the Castro regime. Also, it spends a good amount of time on his writing. So, be forewarned, if what you want is some kind of horror tale of living under Castro, that's here, but it's not the film's sole focus. Also, if what you want is action, stay away. This film has those moments, but you'll get impatient waiting for them.Another caution is your comfort with homosexual issues.

Our writer, sensitive and homosexual, becomes anenemy of the state and must go into hiding to survive. This film, while flawed, is a poignant portrayal of the importance of freedom to all.

534123,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,B00003CXRG,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[20, 20]","Before Night Falls is the second film from painter Julian Schnabel.  Much like his first film, Basquiat, Schnabel uses this film to explore the life of another late artist -- the Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas.  The film follows Arenas for his birth to Cuban peasants, his concurrent discoveries of both homosexuality and poetry during his youth, and his eventual, Hellish imprisonment under Fidel Castro's communist regime.  Arenas was eventually sent to America as a part of the Mariel boatlift which later became infamous for being made up of several psychotics and habitual criminals.  That Castro also included a large number of gay Cubans amongst this bunch shows the beyond low regard in which gays were held in what many still foolishly consider to be Castro's &quot;enlightened&quot; government.  Settling in New York and living in great poverty (but finally with the freedom to be, regardless of his sexuality, acknowledged as a human being), Arenas eventually developed AIDS and killed himself in the early '90s.  It doesn't sound like a happy story yet strangely, one cannot help but be inspired by this film.  Certainly, the scenes in Cuba are the strongest.  Though this is not an explicitly political film and Schnabel is hardly a right-winger, he is still unflinching in portraying how Castro's regime established its power by punishing anyone who dared to display any form of individuality and how homosexuals -- who were hardly on society's A list before Castro came to power -- became a convenient scapegoat.  Through prodigous excerpts from Arenas's writings, Schnabel also shows how, under a system where freedom is forbidden, both art and any display of defiant individuality (in this case, Arenas' sexuality) become all the more important.  They become a lifeblood and finally, the only way to keep oneself from becoming a member of the living dead.  Once Arenas reaches America, the film is a little less sure of itself and, until Arenas finds himself facing death -- at times, it seemed that Arenas made it to America and the next day, discovered he was dying.  The parts of the film dealing with Schnabel's illness might leave some viewers uncomfortable as Schnabel doesn't attempt to sentimentalize or preach.  Yes, it is clear that Arenas, at least according to this film, contracted the disease through having unsafe sex and some might say that, for all his talk of freedom, Arenas' freedom to pursue his lifestyle has now killed him.  But I think to say that would be to seriously misread this film.  AIDS is presented as a risk but, at the same time, its clear that to have the freedom to live life the way you want is more important than that risk.  As well, in New York, at least Arenas has the right to end his own life as opposed to Cuba where he would have been tossed, more or less, into a concentration camp.  In the end, this is a film celebrating freedom -- artistic and personal -- and embracing the potential risks involved in that freedom.As a painter, Schnabel is infamous for his huge canvasses and at times, this film does feel like its striving too hard to be epic and, as a result, about to crash and burn.  However, Schnabel always manages to retain control and, only towards the end, does it seem occasionally a little overlong.  Visually, the film is hauntingly beautiful (especially in the Cuba segments) and Schnabel shows a good feel for getting good performances from his actors.  Javier Bardem is amazing in the lead role -- providing a valuable anchor for the film and never allowing himself to play a 1-D saint.  Amongst the other actors, the best known are probably Sean Penn and Johnny Depp in two brief cameos.  Penn shows up as Areas' father and is actually a bit of a distraction but he's only on screen for a few minutes.  Depp plays two roles during the Cuban prison scenes -- a cross-dressing inmate and a sadistic prison warden.  Though at first it might seem like stunt casting, Depp's two roles make a valuable point about the totalitarian existence -- the only real difference between the outcasts and the establishment is the uniform worn.",4,Better To Die Free Than Live Dead,1003363200,"10 18, 2001",2001,4106,"['Night', 'Falls', 'second', 'film', 'painter', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'Much', 'first', 'film', 'Basquiat', 'Schnabel', 'film', 'explore', 'life', 'late', 'artist', 'Cuban', 'poet', 'Reinaldo', 'Arenas', 'film', 'Arenas', 'birth', 'Cuban', 'peasants', 'concurrent', 'discoveries', 'homosexuality', 'poetry', 'youth', 'eventual', 'Hellish', 'imprisonment', 'Fidel', 'Castro', 'communist', 'regime', 'Arenas', 'was', 'eventually', 'sent', 'America', 'part', 'Mariel', 'boatlift', 'later', 'became', 'infamous', 'being', 'made', 'several', 'psychotics', 'habitual', 'criminals', 'Castro', 'also', 'included', 'large', 'number', 'gay', 'Cubans', 'amongst', 'bunch', 'low', 'regard', 'gays', 'were', 'held', 'what', 'many', 'still', 'foolishly', 'consider', 'be', 'Castro', 'quot', 'enlightened', 'quot', 'government', 'Settling', 'New', 'York', 'living', 'great', 'poverty', 'finally', 'freedom', 'be', 'regardless', 'sexuality', 'acknowledged', 'human', 'being', 'Arenas', 'eventually', 'developed', 'AIDS', 'killed', 'early', ""'90s"", ""n't"", 'sound', 'happy', 'story', 'yet', 'strangely', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'inspired', 'film', 'Certainly', 'scenes', 'Cuba', 'are', 'strongest', 'not', 'explicitly', 'political', 'film', 'Schnabel', 'hardly', 'right-winger', 'still', 'unflinching', 'portraying', 'how', 'Castro', 'regime', 'established', 'power', 'punishing', 'anyone', 'who', 'dared', 'display', 'form', 'individuality', 'how', 'homosexuals', 'who', 'were', 'hardly', 'society', 'A', 'list', 'Castro', 'came', 'power', 'became', 'convenient', 'scapegoat', 'prodigous', 'excerpts', 'Arenas', 'writings', 'Schnabel', 'also', 'how', 'system', 'where', 'freedom', 'forbidden', 'art', 'display', 'defiant', 'individuality', 'case', 'Arenas', 'sexuality', 'become', 'more', 'important', 'become', 'lifeblood', 'finally', 'only', 'way', 'keep', 'becoming', 'member', 'living', 'dead', 'Once', 'Arenas', 'reaches', 'America', 'film', 'little', 'less', 'sure', 'Arenas', 'facing', 'death', 'times', 'seemed', 'Arenas', 'made', 'America', 'next', 'day', 'discovered', 'was', 'dying', 'parts', 'film', 'dealing', 'Schnabel', 'illness', 'might', 'leave', 'viewers', 'uncomfortable', 'Schnabel', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'sentimentalize', 'preach', 'Yes', 'clear', 'Arenas', 'least', 'according', 'film', 'contracted', 'disease', 'having', 'unsafe', 'sex', 'might', 'say', 'talk', 'freedom', 'Arenas', 'freedom', 'pursue', 'lifestyle', 'now', 'killed', 'think', 'say', 'would', 'be', 'seriously', 'misread', 'film', 'AIDS', 'presented', 'risk', 'same', 'time', 'clear', 'have', 'freedom', 'live', 'life', 'way', 'want', 'more', 'important', 'risk', 'well', 'New', 'York', 'least', 'Arenas', 'right', 'end', 'own', 'life', 'opposed', 'Cuba', 'where', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'tossed', 'more', 'less', 'concentration', 'camp', 'end', 'film', 'celebrating', 'freedom', 'artistic', 'personal', 'embracing', 'potential', 'risks', 'involved', 'painter', 'Schnabel', 'infamous', 'huge', 'canvasses', 'times', 'film', 'feel', 'striving', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'epic', 'result', 'crash', 'burn', 'However', 'Schnabel', 'always', 'retain', 'control', 'only', 'end', 'seem', 'occasionally', 'little', 'overlong', 'Visually', 'film', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'especially', 'Cuba', 'segments', 'Schnabel', 'good', 'feel', 'getting', 'good', 'performances', 'actors', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'amazing', 'lead', 'role', 'providing', 'valuable', 'anchor', 'film', 'never', 'allowing', 'play', '1-D', 'saint', 'other', 'actors', 'best', 'known', 'are', 'probably', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'two', 'brief', 'cameos', 'Penn', 'up', 'Areas', 'father', 'actually', 'bit', 'distraction', 'only', 'screen', 'few', 'minutes', 'Depp', 'two', 'roles', 'Cuban', 'prison', 'scenes', 'cross-dressing', 'inmate', 'sadistic', 'prison', 'warden', 'Though', 'first', 'might', 'seem', 'stunt', 'casting', 'Depp', 'two', 'roles', 'make', 'valuable', 'point', 'totalitarian', 'existence', 'only', 'real', 'difference', 'outcasts', 'establishment', 'uniform', 'worn']",N/A

At once stunningly beautiful and heartbreakingly deppressed, &quot;Before NIght Falls&quot; testifies to the power of both the forces of nature and the innate condition of the human self.  Javier Bardem is brilliant as the noted writer Reinaldo Arenas, who was publicly humiliated by the Castro regime for daring to tell the truth, about his country, the revolution itself, and his own inner self.  Edited to resemble a rollercoaster ride, viewers might find themselves lost on occassion by the mix of political and personal stroies, told against the backdrop of a persecuting dictatorship that has thus far existed survived beyond anyone's wildest expectations.  To the director's credit, the Cuban landscape is etched with majestic beauty and pathos, at once incredibly beautiful and yet bittersweet, as if all the color had been drained from it.  Bardem does a wonderful job of conveying Arena's mixture of pain and hope, first showing the support the writer had for Castro and then seeing the personal pain the dictator imposed.  The prison sequences, some of which are told in dream settings, are forceful and rich, evocative of &quot;Midnight Express&quot; and yet intensely personal.  While the film portrays the artist's reality in a manner some viewers found difficult to take, its nightmarish vision of how the Cuban people have suffered is notable.  Few films have dared to delve into such challenging themes, and fewer still have gone within a Latino culture that at once celebrates its machoisms yet cheers the humiliation of its own.

The fact that Oliver does not appear until the end of this movie did not really cause a problem for me.

I was mesmerized by his protrayal of Reinaldo Arenas.  And while this movie may not be for everyone, I would say it is the best biographical movie I have seen in my lifetime.  As added bonuses, there was Oliver Martinez, for me, of course.  Also, Sean Penn was very good in his few minutes on the screen.  Johnny Depp had me lauging out loud at his potrayal of the transvite and the officer.  His facial expressions alone are pure comical genius.  And, while I am a huge Johnny Depp fan,as well, I am glad his parts were minimal as Javier Bardem is the true acting genius in this film.

534127,A321QDKGBFFHMT,B00003CXRG,"Leonard Dahlke ""Ummmmm""","[5, 6]","Schnabel's film Before Night Falls was my favorite film of 2001. Vastly underrated, and seemingly ignored by many people. The film is an astoundingly rich experience for both the eyes, ears and intellect. After viewing it it will not leave your mind quickly unlike so many of the Mc-Films that are being churned out by Holly-Wooden.I wont delve as much on the plot line as most other reviewers here have done so for me. I want to comment about the Visuals/Cinematography. Schnabel's eye view in this film is nothing short of brilliant. Tarnished, imperfectly stunning images steep this film and inhabit the frame providing atmosphere so vivid that you are smelling the cigar smoke, hearing the waves crashing on the beaches, squishing the mud between your toes, feeling the humid tropical heat. The result is a tactile sensual experience that, for some, will linger in the mind for ages.This film hit me on a very personal level and when I first saw it it was like drinking a cool glass of water after being thirsty for a very long time. The heavyness of the plot and the struggle that Arenas endures could make some people balk at taking this film on. Its not altogether pretty, the hardships he endures. But the saving grace is Javier Bardem's nuanced performance and large brown eyes that he invites us to use to view the world of his character. The poetry and depth that one experiences thru Arenas' words seem to spill from Bardem's every pore. The visuals along with his voice overs help with the effect. I highly recommend the film with one reservation. I found Jonny Depps performance as the nasty prison official as klutzy, overdone. It actually mocked the horror of the scene in my mind. A very bad decision by Schnabel in my view.

534129,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00003CXRG,Linda Linguvic,"[10, 27]","This film is based on the life of Reinaldo Arenas, a Cuban poet and novelist who was persecuted by Castro's government because he was an artist and because he was a homosexual.  Directed by Julian Schnabel and starring the Spanish actor Javier Bardem with two small cameo roles by Johnny Depp, this film has won many awards.  It's serious, twisted, sad and brutal.  And it's also very honest, especially in its depiction of the gay life style.The acting is good and so is the cinematography but I found it was much too episodic and the dream sequences confusing.  Also, I wish the director had made up his mind whether to film it in Spanish or English.  There are parts that are in Spanish and the sub-titles were easy to read, but most of it is played in heavily accented English which was so difficult to understand that I had to re-play several sections over and over again on my VCR until I could understand the dialog.  Also, at 133 minutes, it was much too long and I found myself losing interest and falling asleep.The best part of the film was the archival footage of the coming to power of the Castro regime and the director did an excellent job of depicting the realities of Cuba during the 1960s and 70s.  But frankly, I would have preferred a documentary instead of some of the staged scenes, which were played for shock value.  It also tried too hard to be a work of art in itself. Not recommended.

534130,A3AYDEWU1EPF15,B00003CXRG,Luis Hernandez,"[44, 49]","Based on the memoirs of the late gay Cuban poet/author Reinaldo Arenas, &quot;Before Night Falls&quot; is a lengthy, depressing, yet brutally realistic film on the life Arenas before, during, and after the Cuban Revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power. Starting with his childhood in rural Holguin, Cuba, the film covers every aspect of Arenas' upbringing, his attraction to men, and his run-ins with revolutionary agents as he became one of the island nation's most prominent writers.Arenas, portrayed excellently by Spanish actor Javier Bardem, sees his life change dramatically, first from what he believes will become a promising age of development after the ruthless Batista regime is toppled by Castro's forces, to later a life of living in fear and hiding as he is blacklisted due to his writings and homosexuality by the new regime's ideological police.As the film progresses, we see how Arenas deals with the repression of the regime in it's early days, and his persecution for his writings, many that were smuggled out of Cuba by French sympathizers of Arenas's work. Later arrested for a crime that he didn't commit, Arenas finds himself a fugitive living in Cuba, until he is arrested and sent to a Cuban prison before his eventual departure from the island in the Mariel Boatlift of the late 1970'sThe film, which is one of the most powerful pieces of filmmaking I have seen in recent years, was directed with style and respect by Julian Schnabel. The film, which is a pioneer to the sense of the many visuals of the male anatomy/body used to illustrate this story of growing up gay in Castro's Cuba might disturb some people who are not accustomed in seeing this on the silver screen and/or gay sexuality. However, this shouldn't be a reason in not seeing this film.Many excellent actors lend their talent to this, most notably Johnny Depp (&quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;) in a dual role as a prison manager and as a drag queen entertainer at the prison. Also contributing his immense talent is Sean Penn (&quot;U-Turn&quot;) in a small role as a wagon driver who picks up a young Arenas on his way to fight in the Revolution. Also many fans of Latin telenovelas will recognize Cuban actor Francisco Gattorno (&quot;Strawberry and Chocolate&quot;) in a rare English-language role as a French sympathizer who helps Arenas get his work published abroad in France.Simply one of the best films of 2000, this is a must-see film for anyone interested in Cuba, it's people, or human rights. While many might see the Castro regime as a very repressive one, in fact the previous Batista regime was equally as ruthless with homosexuals, especially those in Cuba's high society. In the past decade, Castro has allowed greater freedom for homosexuals, so much that the Cuban government funded the Academy-Award nominated for Best Foreign Film, &quot;Strawberry &amp; Chocolate&quot;) back in the early 1990's.One of the best films of 2000!

534139,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00003CXRG,Reviewer,"[15, 18]","There's a lyrical quality to this film that makes the brutality of the oppression it depicts seem almost tangible, and ""Before Night Falls, "" directed by Julian Schnabel, is photographed in a way that gives much of it something of a documentary feel (and, indeed, some archival footage is included), which defines the drama and adds to the overall impact of the film.  And quite a story it is.  The true story of writer Reinaldo Arenas (Javier Bardem), who was born in Cuba in 1943, it touches on his childhood, but concentrates on the `60s and `70s, during which time Arenas was considered a counter-revolutionary by the Cuban government because of his writing, as well as his homosexuality.Schnabel pulls no punches as he presents an incisive picture of the suffering inflicted upon Arenas (and others) through the wanton mistreatment and discrimination of Castro's regime.  Extremely well crafted and delivered, it's a film that makes a powerful statement about many of the things so many take for granted.  Like freedom of speech and assembly.  For as the film points out, in post-revolution Cuba, a gathering of more than three becomes a criminal offense; a group of people getting together for a poetry reading become criminals of the State, and the punishment for expressing one's own thoughts can be, at the very least, torture and imprisonment.This is the environment in which Arenas grew and matured, as a person, a poet, a writer; still, he was irrepressible when it came to his work, and managed to create and have some of it published, but only by smuggling it out of Cuba (in one instance to France, where his book was named Best Foreign Novel of the year).  It's a ruthless, uncompromising world Schnabel lays bare with his camera, and it's that realistic recreation of that very real time and place that is one of the strengths of this film.  But what really drives it and makes it so compelling, is Bardem's incredible portrayal of Arenas.To say that Bardem's performance was worthy of an Oscar would be an understatement; along with Ed Harris (in ""Pollock""), it was quite simply one of the two best of the year (2000).  In order to bring Arenas to life, it was necessary for Bardem to capture all of the myriad complexities of the man and the artist, which he did-- and to perfection.  It's a challenging role, and Bardem more than lives up to it, with a detailed performance through which he expresses the physical, as well as the emotional aspects of the character:  His mannerisms, his walk, the body language that says so much about who he is; how he copes with living in a seemingly hopeless situation.  By the end of the movie, because of Bardem, you know who Reinaldo Arenas was, and you're not likely to forget him.The most poignant scenes in the film are those in which Arenas' words are being recited as the camera creates a visual context for them, looking out through the window of a moving car or bus at the streets, towns, buildings and people, as Arenas describes them.  These scenes fill the senses and are virtually transporting; and it is in them that the true poetic nature of Arenas is made manifest.  It's beautiful imagery, and the contrast between the beauty of the words and the ugliness of the reality against which it is set is powerful.  All of which is beautifully conceived and executed by Schnabel; an excellent piece of filmmaking.In a dual supporting performance, Johnny Depp is effective as Bon Bon, a ""queen"" Arenas meets during his incarceration, and also as Lieutenant Victor, who oversees the prison.  Each character is unique, and it's quite a showcase for Depp's versatility.Rounding out the supporting cast are Olivier Martinez (Lazaro), Andrea Di Stefano (Pepe), Sean Penn (Cuco), Michael Wincott (Herberto), Pedro Armendariz Jr. (Reinaldo's Grandfather) and Vito Maria Schnabel (Teenage Reinaldo).  A film that is not necessarily entertaining, and at times unpleasant to watch because of it's stark realism, ""Before Night Falls"" is, nevertheless, thought-provoking, riveting drama that is thoroughly engrossing.  And it proves that beauty can indeed be found in the least likely of places.  But it also makes you realize that it is up to each individual to care enough to seek it out, and to hopefully have the wisdom to realize it once it is found.  And that's the real beauty of a film like this; it affords you the opportunity to do just that.",5,Powerful Performance by Bardem,989625600,"05 12, 2001",2001,4406,"['lyrical', 'quality', 'film', 'brutality', 'oppression', 'seem', 'almost', 'tangible', 'Night', 'Falls', 'directed', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'photographed', 'way', 'much', 'something', 'documentary', 'feel', 'indeed', 'archival', 'footage', 'included', 'drama', 'overall', 'impact', 'film', 'quite', 'story', 'true', 'story', 'writer', 'Reinaldo', 'Arenas', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'Cuba', '1943', 'childhood', '60s', '70s', 'time', 'Arenas', 'was', 'considered', 'counter-revolutionary', 'Cuban', 'government', 'writing', 'as', 'well', 'homosexuality.Schnabel', 'punches', 'incisive', 'picture', 'suffering', 'inflicted', 'Arenas', 'others', 'wanton', 'mistreatment', 'discrimination', 'Castro', 'regime', 'Extremely', 'well', 'crafted', 'delivered', 'film', 'powerful', 'statement', 'many', 'things', 'so', 'many', 'take', 'granted', 'freedom', 'speech', 'assembly', 'film', 'points', 'out', 'post-revolution', 'Cuba', 'gathering', 'more', 'three', 'criminal', 'offense', 'group', 'people', 'getting', 'together', 'poetry', 'reading', 'become', 'criminals', 'State', 'punishment', 'expressing', 'one', 'own', 'thoughts', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'least', 'torture', 'imprisonment.This', 'environment', 'Arenas', 'grew', 'matured', 'person', 'poet', 'writer', 'still', 'was', 'irrepressible', 'when', 'came', 'work', 'managed', 'create', 'have', 'published', 'only', 'smuggling', 'Cuba', 'one', 'instance', 'France', 'where', 'book', 'was', 'named', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Novel', 'year', 'ruthless', 'uncompromising', 'world', 'Schnabel', 'bare', 'camera', 'realistic', 'recreation', 'very', 'real', 'time', 'place', 'one', 'strengths', 'film', 'what', 'really', 'so', 'compelling', 'Bardem', 'incredible', 'portrayal', 'Arenas.To', 'say', 'Bardem', 'performance', 'was', 'worthy', 'Oscar', 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Pollock', 'was', 'quite', 'simply', 'one', 'two', 'best', 'year', '2000', 'order', 'bring', 'Arenas', 'life', 'was', 'necessary', 'Bardem', 'capture', 'myriad', 'complexities', 'man', 'artist', 'did', 'perfection', 'challenging', 'role', 'Bardem', 'more', 'up', 'detailed', 'performance', 'physical', 'as', 'well', 'emotional', 'aspects', 'character', 'mannerisms', 'walk', 'body', 'language', 'so', 'much', 'who', 'how', 'living', 'seemingly', 'hopeless', 'situation', 'end', 'movie', 'Bardem', 'know', 'who', 'Reinaldo', 'Arenas', 'was', ""'re"", 'not', 'likely', 'forget', 'him.The', 'most', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'Arenas', 'words', 'are', 'being', 'recited', 'camera', 'visual', 'context', 'looking', 'out', 'window', 'moving', 'car', 'bus', 'streets', 'towns', 'buildings', 'people', 'Arenas', 'scenes', 'fill', 'senses', 'are', 'virtually', 'transporting', 'true', 'poetic', 'nature', 'Arenas', 'made', 'manifest', 'beautiful', 'imagery', 'contrast', 'beauty', 'words', 'ugliness', 'reality', 'set', 'powerful', 'beautifully', 'conceived', 'executed', 'Schnabel', 'excellent', 'piece', 'filmmaking.In', 'dual', 'supporting', 'performance', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'effective', 'Bon', 'Bon', 'queen', 'Arenas', 'meets', 'incarceration', 'also', 'Lieutenant', 'Victor', 'who', 'prison', 'character', 'unique', 'quite', 'showcase', 'Depp', 'versatility.Rounding', 'out', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'Olivier', 'Martinez', 'Lazaro', 'Andrea', 'Di', 'Stefano', 'Pepe', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Cuco', 'Michael', 'Wincott', 'Herberto', 'Pedro', 'Armendariz', 'Jr.', 'Reinaldo', 'Grandfather', 'Vito', 'Maria', 'Schnabel', 'Teenage', 'Reinaldo', 'film', 'not', 'necessarily', 'entertaining', 'times', 'unpleasant', 'watch', 'stark', 'realism', 'Night', 'Falls', 'nevertheless', 'thought-provoking', 'riveting', 'drama', 'thoroughly', 'engrossing', 'beauty', 'can', 'indeed', 'be', 'found', 'least', 'likely', 'places', 'also', 'realize', 'up', 'individual', 'care', 'enough', 'seek', 'out', 'hopefully', 'have', 'wisdom', 'realize', 'found', 'real', 'beauty', 'film', 'opportunity', 'do', 'just']",N/A
534140,A12X2J7AVZ04IQ,B00003CXRG,"R. Gawlitta ""Coolmoan""","[6, 7]","Director Julian Schnabel, an artist himself, has centered his two best-known films on fine, misunderstood artists. ""Basquiat"" (with Jeffrey Wright) was well-received and lovingly portrayed. The life of Fernando Arenas, in ""Before Night Falls"", was a little more complicated, but true artistry shows through. This writer, a victim of Castro's Cuba, had a tough time dealng with his own personal situation as well as his powerful desire to write. A fearless, powerful performance by Javier Bardem carries this beyond any simple story. Mr. Schnabel managed to get Johnny Depp to provide a dual role (or was it?); one as a gorgeous transvestite and the other as a nasty Lieutenant of the guard. Olivier Martinez (""Unfaithful"") was strong. So many beautiful men in one film, acting against type. Very intriguing. Cameo appearances from Sean Penn, and the great old character actor, Pedro Armendariz (as the grandpa) were well-integrated. The great director Hector Babenco (""Kiss of the Spider Woman"") also has a small role.It's Bardem who carries this to greatness, with Schnabel's sure hand; cinematography was remarkably beautiful for an independent film. Here's the influence of Schnabel, always the artist. Extras on the DVD include a real interview with Arenas; a short video recollection by Schnabel's daughter, Lola, taken during the filming in Mexico. Another longer extra includes a tour of Schnabel's art studio, which I thought might be a self-indulgent trip, but is actually quite insightful into the mind of this talented man.But it's the remarkable, beautiful Javier Bardem that is the #1 reason to see this film.

534143,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXRG,Roland E. Zwick,"[7, 8]","""Before Night Falls"" is a compelling film that works on several different levels simultaneously:  as a biography of the late Cuban poet and novelist Reinaldo Arenas; as a scathing indictment of Castro's repressive Communist regime; and as a celebration of the human spirit flourishing under even the most adverse of circumstances.  What it doesn't quite do, though, is dig very deeply into the mind and spirit of its main character.  We are fascinated by the atmosphere and events that define this life story.  We just don't feel like we get to know very well the man at its core.The film, which spans five decades (from 1943 - 1990), stars the brilliant Javier Bardem as Arenas, a homosexual writer caught in a culture openly hostile to both homosexuals and writers.  One of the theses that the film posits - one taken directly from Arenas' writings - is that governmental repression often has the paradoxical effect of actually ENCOURAGING the very elements it is trying to stifle.  Thus, for a while at least, Arenas is allowed to express fairly openly his homosexual nature.  In fact, it is even pointed out to us that a number of high government officials are allowed to flagrantly display their sexuality with little or no consequences.  Yet, at the same time, the government has set up concentration camps filled with gays and other political prisoners.  But it is not so much for his sexuality that Arenas is eventually incarcerated and tortured - it simply provides a convenient excuse - but for his radical anti-Castro ideas as reflected in his poetry and novels.  For it is ideas that most threaten any totalitarian regime, and Castro's is certainly no exception.The movie is so ambitious in its scope and time frame that it occasionally loses us along the way.  Every now and then we are not quite sure who is who, where we happen to be, or what exactly is happening in the story.  This is partly the result of Julian Schnabel's rather impressionistic directorial style, providing us with quick cuts of imaginings and/or memories that flash through Arenas' mind.  The problem is that we can't always tell which is a memory and which a mere fanciful vision.  For instance, in one scene, a desperate Arenas, in an attempt to evade the authorities, sails out for Florida in nothing more than an old inner tube.  The way the scene is shot we are led to believe, initially, that he has made it safely to America's shore, only to discover later that he is still on Cuba.  It is a minor point, but the style often leaves us feeling unnecessarily disoriented at times.On the other hand, the style also contributes a strangely dreamy, otherworldly feel to the film.  This matches perfectly the rather exotic nature of Arenas himself, a man who seems to be torn between accepting his homosexuality and fighting the demons that come along with being a societal outcast.  When Arenas finally makes it to the ""land of freedom"" as part of the Mariel boat lift of 1980, fate deals him another cruel blow in the form of AIDS.  Yet, Arenas' words live on, a testament both to the cruelty and brutality of life under a dictatorship and to the strength of spirit reflected in any artist who tries to overcome it.As Arenas, Barkem gives a riveting performance, going far beyond the subtle effeminate mannerisms that define the character's surface.  Yet, strangely enough, even though the film runs well over two hours and there is almost no scene in which Arenas is not present, we never feel like we really get to know him very well.  Perhaps it is because, in his romantic relationships, in particular, Arenas remains such an inscrutable enigma.  Apart from his sexual orientation, we often can't tell what makes this character tick.  This is why Barkem's performance is so indispensable to the film.  The richness he provides in his every word, facial expression and gesture makes Arenas a very real and very recognizable figure.  Without Barkem, ""Before Night Falls"" would be much less compelling than it is.And the fact is, that for all its imperfections, ""Before Night Falls"" IS a very compelling film, in terms of style, performance, atmosphere and theme.  Despite the dissatisfaction we may feel with the film at times, the truth is that the story itself is so gripping that our interest never flags for a moment.  And if for no other reason than for the uncompromising glimpse it affords into the hitherto unexamined world of Castro's Cuba, the film cries out to be seen.",4,fascinating glimpse into Castro's Cuba,995155200,"07 15, 2001",2001,4472,"['Night', 'Falls', 'compelling', 'film', 'several', 'different', 'levels', 'simultaneously', 'biography', 'late', 'Cuban', 'poet', 'novelist', 'Reinaldo', 'Arenas', 'scathing', 'indictment', 'Castro', 'repressive', 'Communist', 'regime', 'celebration', 'human', 'spirit', 'flourishing', 'even', 'most', 'adverse', 'circumstances', 'What', ""n't"", 'quite', 'do', 'dig', 'very', 'deeply', 'mind', 'spirit', 'main', 'character', 'are', 'fascinated', 'atmosphere', 'events', 'define', 'life', 'story', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'get', 'know', 'very', 'well', 'man', 'core.The', 'film', 'five', 'decades', '1943', '1990', 'brilliant', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'Arenas', 'homosexual', 'writer', 'caught', 'culture', 'openly', 'hostile', 'homosexuals', 'writers', 'One', 'theses', 'film', 'one', 'taken', 'directly', 'Arenas', 'writings', 'governmental', 'repression', 'often', 'paradoxical', 'effect', 'actually', 'ENCOURAGING', 'very', 'trying', 'stifle', 'Thus', 'while', 'least', 'Arenas', 'allowed', 'express', 'fairly', 'openly', 'homosexual', 'nature', 'fact', 'even', 'pointed', 'out', 'number', 'high', 'government', 'officials', 'are', 'allowed', 'flagrantly', 'display', 'sexuality', 'little', 'consequences', 'same', 'time', 'government', 'set', 'up', 'concentration', 'camps', 'filled', 'gays', 'other', 'political', 'prisoners', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'sexuality', 'Arenas', 'eventually', 'incarcerated', 'tortured', 'simply', 'convenient', 'excuse', 'radical', 'anti-Castro', 'ideas', 'reflected', 'poetry', 'novels', 'ideas', 'most', 'threaten', 'totalitarian', 'regime', 'Castro', 'certainly', 'no', 'exception.The', 'movie', 'so', 'ambitious', 'scope', 'time', 'frame', 'occasionally', 'way', 'now', 'then', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'who', 'who', 'where', 'happen', 'be', 'what', 'exactly', 'happening', 'story', 'partly', 'result', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'rather', 'impressionistic', 'directorial', 'style', 'providing', 'quick', 'cuts', 'imaginings', 'and/or', 'memories', 'flash', 'Arenas', 'mind', 'problem', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'tell', 'memory', 'mere', 'fanciful', 'vision', 'instance', 'one', 'scene', 'desperate', 'Arenas', 'attempt', 'evade', 'authorities', 'out', 'Florida', 'nothing', 'more', 'old', 'inner', 'tube', 'way', 'scene', 'shot', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'initially', 'made', 'safely', 'America', 'shore', 'only', 'discover', 'later', 'still', 'Cuba', 'minor', 'point', 'style', 'often', 'feeling', 'unnecessarily', 'disoriented', 'times.On', 'other', 'hand', 'style', 'also', 'strangely', 'dreamy', 'otherworldly', 'feel', 'film', 'perfectly', 'rather', 'exotic', 'nature', 'Arenas', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'torn', 'accepting', 'homosexuality', 'fighting', 'demons', 'come', 'along', 'being', 'societal', 'outcast', 'When', 'Arenas', 'finally', 'land', 'freedom', 'part', 'Mariel', 'boat', 'lift', '1980', 'fate', 'deals', 'cruel', 'blow', 'form', 'AIDS', 'Arenas', 'words', 'live', 'testament', 'cruelty', 'brutality', 'life', 'dictatorship', 'strength', 'spirit', 'reflected', 'artist', 'who', 'overcome', 'it.As', 'Arenas', 'Barkem', 'riveting', 'performance', 'going', 'far', 'subtle', 'effeminate', 'mannerisms', 'define', 'character', 'surface', 'strangely', 'enough', 'even', 'film', 'well', 'two', 'hours', 'almost', 'scene', 'Arenas', 'not', 'present', 'never', 'feel', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'very', 'well', 'Perhaps', 'because', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'particular', 'Arenas', 'such', 'inscrutable', 'enigma', 'Apart', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'often', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'character', 'tick', 'why', 'Barkem', 'performance', 'so', 'indispensable', 'film', 'richness', 'word', 'facial', 'expression', 'gesture', 'Arenas', 'very', 'real', 'very', 'recognizable', 'figure', 'Barkem', 'Night', 'Falls', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'less', 'compelling', 'fact', 'imperfections', 'Night', 'Falls', 'very', 'compelling', 'film', 'terms', 'style', 'performance', 'atmosphere', 'theme', 'dissatisfaction', 'may', 'feel', 'film', 'times', 'truth', 'story', 'so', 'gripping', 'interest', 'never', 'flags', 'moment', 'other', 'reason', 'uncompromising', 'glimpse', 'hitherto', 'unexamined', 'world', 'Castro', 'Cuba', 'film', 'out', 'be', 'seen']",N/A

Penola,"[2, 2]","Julian Schnabel's stunning film biography of Cuban poet Reinaldo Arena is at once a dream and a nightmare, and accomplishes what few artist biographies ever do -- it embodies in spirit and in tone the work of the man whose story it tells.  Javier Bardem will rip your heart out as the sensitive, brilliant gay poet, whose chaotic, joyful, and sad life takes more than its fair share of impactful, pathetic turns.

It does not have a pressing sense of accuracy, nor is there a chronologically coherent narrative. It's a film that explores the life of an artist, but filters everything through a perspective which leaves the viewer to ponder and establish his or her own conclusions. &quot;Before Night Falls&quot; is not something one would watch for entertainment, a characteristic that automatically divides people. To me, this was one of the most intellectually provocative and emotionally stirring films I'd seen in quite some time, and it's only elevated by the altogether remarkable performance of Javier Bardem. Unlike most movies based on real people's lives, this ones floats seamlessly through memories, dreams and reality. It unfolds with both the engrossing ambiguity of a poem, and the stark realism of a documentary. &quot;Before Night Falls&quot; essentially examines the journey of Reinaldo Arenas, and illustrates his growth as an artist, but also more poignantly, as a human being trying to find solace amidst the callous world around him. The film's glimpse into Cuba's revolution and the crippling effect it had on the &quot;outsiders&quot; only deepens the power of Reinaldo Arena's tumultuous quest to fulfill his dreams. The fragmented quality of the film never really lets the narrative or it's charaters become entirely focused, but the vibrant immediacy of the images, sounds and dialogue gradually builds an emotional resonance, leading to a quietly devastating conclusion.(My only complaint is the occasionally awkward and rambling structural fashion of the story.) If there is one aspect that holds everything together, though, it's the central performer himself, Javier Bardem. Rarely have I seen an actor embody a role with such sensitivity and compassion, Bardem renders the shadowy figure of Reinaldo Arenas and infuses him with life in every scene. It's just a shame that the Academy couldn't recognize the superiority of his performance. On the whole, though, &quot;Before Night Falls&quot; is a haunting evocation of one man's struggle to eternalize the flame which society tried to extinguish.

That's the main feeling I got watching this yawn fest. There are just enough hints of passion in the screenplay to suggest really good books hiding behind this version of video cliff notes.

When Castro starts cracking down on dissidents including homosexuals, he spends a lot of time in jail - writing. A lot of his money is made writing for other prisoners. He tries to escape several times but his friends are idiots (including the one guy that dumped him and whom he never should have trusted in the first place) and he keeps getting caught. Eventually he leaves Cuba in one of those ""take them if you want them"" moves by Castro. Five minutes later he's dying of AIDS. Ten minutes later he's dead (and one gets the feeling that those ten minutes are an entire last book). The end.What works in this movie is Javier Bardem's acting (although the rest of the cast is great too). What doesn't work is Bardem's crotch in the camera every other scene. We got it. He's gay. He loves sex. But every other scene? Maybe if I was gay I'd be more into that, but I doubt it -- it's just too crass.What also doesn't work is the fact that all five books have to be compressed into this thing.

534155,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B00003CXRG,Westley,"[52, 55]","""Before Night Falls"" recounts the incredible life of Cuban poet and novelist Reinaldo Arenas, played with great sensitivity by Spanish actor Javier Bardem.  Born a peasant in the 1930's, Arenas had the great misfortune of being a gay writer in a country that considered art and homosexuality to be counter-revolutionary.  ""Before Night Falls"" is based on his memoir and relates his imprisonment in Cuba and subsequent exodus to the United States.  Despite this persecution, Arenas' work flourished and was published widely, albeit mostly outside of Cuba.Director Julian Schnabel is a well-known ""neo-expressionist"" painter; accordingly, he is able to bring an artist's understanding and sensibility to the story.  His prior film was ""Basquiat,"" about the 1980's graffiti artist.  Although Schnabel seems to be limiting himself to portraits of artists, the two films are very disparate.  Specifically, ""Before Night Falls"" is much grander in scope and incorporates more directorial flourishes than does ""Basquiat.""  Despite the epic sweep of the film, Schnabel successfully tells Arenas' very personal and heart-rending story.  Another major asset of the film is the cinematography and ambiance; vibrant colors and people populate the film.  The viewer is transported to 1960s Cuba; you can feel the humidity and the pulse of the Mambo music.Javier Bardem gives an astonishing performance, for which he deservedly received Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor.  For the role, he was required to learn Cuban-Spanish as well as English.  The DVD extras include a 7 minute interview with Arenas, and it's apparent that Bardem nails the look and speech of the artist, without reverting to a simple impersonation.  Although most of the actors are of Latin descent, two big American stars have small roles: Johnny Depp has hilarious joint roles as a Cuban transvestite and a Cuban general, and Sean Penn plays a peasant farmer, rather convincingly too.  The only minor debit of the film is that it's a tad over-long and could have used a bit more editing.  However, overall, ""Before Night Falls"" is a superb film that perfectly captures another time and another place.  Most highly recommended.Extras: The extras include an interesting commentary track with Schnabel and Bardem, a short behind-the-scenes documentary filmed by Schnabel's daughter, and an interview with Arenas conducted in 1984 after he immigrated to the U.S.",5,Transports You,1078704000,"03 8, 2004",2004,2432,"['Night', 'Falls', 'incredible', 'life', 'Cuban', 'poet', 'novelist', 'Reinaldo', 'Arenas', 'played', 'great', 'sensitivity', 'Spanish', 'actor', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'Born', 'peasant', '1930', 'Arenas', 'had', 'great', 'misfortune', 'being', 'gay', 'writer', 'country', 'considered', 'art', 'homosexuality', 'be', 'counter-revolutionary', 'Night', 'Falls', 'based', 'memoir', 'imprisonment', 'Cuba', 'subsequent', 'exodus', 'United', 'States', 'persecution', 'Arenas', 'work', 'flourished', 'was', 'published', 'widely', 'albeit', 'mostly', 'Cuba.Director', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'well-known', 'neo-expressionist', 'painter', 'accordingly', 'able', 'bring', 'artist', 'understanding', 'sensibility', 'story', 'prior', 'film', 'was', 'Basquiat', '1980', 'graffiti', 'artist', 'Schnabel', 'be', 'limiting', 'portraits', 'artists', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'very', 'disparate', 'Specifically', 'Night', 'Falls', 'much', 'grander', 'scope', 'more', 'directorial', 'flourishes', 'Basquiat', 'epic', 'sweep', 'film', 'Schnabel', 'successfully', 'Arenas', 'very', 'personal', 'heart-rending', 'story', 'major', 'asset', 'film', 'cinematography', 'ambiance', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'people', 'populate', 'film', 'viewer', 'transported', '1960s', 'Cuba', 'can', 'feel', 'humidity', 'pulse', 'Mambo', 'music.Javier', 'Bardem', 'astonishing', 'performance', 'deservedly', 'received', 'Oscar', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nominations', 'Best', 'Actor', 'role', 'was', 'required', 'learn', 'Cuban-Spanish', 'as', 'well', 'English', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', '7', 'minute', 'interview', 'Arenas', 'apparent', 'Bardem', 'look', 'speech', 'artist', 'reverting', 'simple', 'impersonation', 'most', 'actors', 'are', 'Latin', 'descent', 'two', 'big', 'American', 'stars', 'have', 'small', 'roles', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'hilarious', 'joint', 'roles', 'Cuban', 'transvestite', 'Cuban', 'general', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'peasant', 'farmer', 'rather', 'convincingly', 'too', 'only', 'minor', 'debit', 'film', 'tad', 'over-long', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'bit', 'more', 'editing', 'However', 'overall', 'Night', 'Falls', 'superb', 'film', 'perfectly', 'time', 'place', 'Most', 'highly', 'recommended.Extras', 'extras', 'include', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'track', 'Schnabel', 'Bardem', 'short', 'behind-the-scenes', 'documentary', 'filmed', 'Schnabel', 'daughter', 'interview', 'Arenas', 'conducted', '1984', 'immigrated', 'U.S']",N/A
