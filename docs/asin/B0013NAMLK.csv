1143904,A3IRBCCB3I5PPD,B0013NAMLK,"Anastasia McPherson ""Bibliophile""","[19, 20]","I am a fan of Downton Abbey and was looking for similar titles to keep me happy between episodes. The Grand came up on my recommendation list and I watched with interest.The Grand takes place in a high class hotel in Manchester and examines the relationships between the family that owns the hotel, the staff that works at the hotel and the guests that stay in the hotel. Made over ten years ago, The Grand doesn't have the magnificent production values of Downton Abbey but replaces that with a gritty realism that is at times disturbing.WWI has recently ended and England is in the midst of the social changes that will transform the world by the end of WWII. People in service are not only daring to dream of something better, they are actively pursuing a better life and questioning the class system that has held all of Britain for centuries. The tension between these strivings and a normal fear of change by those in the middle and upper classes provides the narrative tension for this drama.None of the characters are particularly likeable but they are realistic and their struggles to better themselves or maintain their style of life ring true and are very emotionally affecting. Unlike Upstairs, Downstairs or Downton Abbey, The Grand examines the differences between the middle class and the working class rather than between the aristocracy and the working class. Lord Crawley wouldn't have the family that owns the Grand to dinner.Other reviewers have commented on the political agenda and the lack of likable characters in the series. These criticisms are fair only up to a point. Life was very difficult in post-war England, a fact that many English dramas minimize. Gentlemen of the middle and upper classes still considered girls of the lower classes as amusing prey to be discarded when the fun was finished. Prostitution was still an avenue of both desperation and a way to materially better a working class girl's circumstances. Working in service still made you old before your time. The horrors of WWI had shattered the young men of all classes. People in the middle and upper classes were still driven by greed and the desire to maintain their privileged position. Could all of these truths have been better balanced with the human virtues in the character portraits? Yes, but even with that said, I very much enjoyed watching The Grand and it gave me more food for thought than the glossier British dramas do.

1143906,A2SW560X584UEF,B0013NAMLK,Barbara B.,"[100, 117]","I think my negative reaction to this series was a result of my unrealistic expectations. I had just finished watching Upstairs Downstairs and thought The Grand was along those lines, or at least more like The Duchess of Duke Street.Instead, this was a seamy (and at times steamy) and trashed up soap opera. I failed to like or even feel sympathetic for the majority of the characters and, in real life, I would NOT have cared to stay an hour at a time with any of them. Why, then, would I sacrifice an hour of my time watching them?Within the first two episodes, we're ""treated"" to someone blowing his brains out (focus on all that blood on the wall, please), a masochistic pervert being serviced by a former whore, and a swarmy villain who might as well have had a handlebar moustache to twirl.Another reviewer noted, ""This series has everything one could want: love, hate, war vets, lust, deceit, betrayal, money, and power."" The problem for me was that it lacked compassion, affection, likeable people and all the other positive characteristics and activities that make a show worth viewing.So, if you go into it knowing beforehand that it is a melodramatic dip into the dirty end of the pool, you may like it. If you are hoping for something with more smiles than sneers, or something closer to the ""old style"" Masterpiece Theater, you may -- like me -- decide that it just isn't that grand.",2,Overwrought soap opera,1233792000,"02 5, 2009",2009,1395,"['think', 'negative', 'reaction', 'series', 'was', 'result', 'unrealistic', 'expectations', 'had', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'thought', 'Grand', 'was', 'along', 'lines', 'least', 'more', 'Duchess', 'Duke', 'Street.Instead', 'was', 'seamy', 'times', 'steamy', 'trashed', 'up', 'soap', 'opera', 'failed', 'like', 'even', 'feel', 'sympathetic', 'majority', 'characters', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'NOT', 'have', 'cared', 'stay', 'hour', 'time', 'Why', 'then', 'would', 'sacrifice', 'hour', 'time', 'watching', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', ""'re"", 'treated', 'someone', 'blowing', 'brains', 'out', 'focus', 'blood', 'wall', 'please', 'masochistic', 'pervert', 'being', 'serviced', 'former', 'whore', 'swarmy', 'villain', 'who', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'had', 'handlebar', 'moustache', 'twirl.Another', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'series', 'everything', 'one', 'could', 'want', 'love', 'hate', 'war', 'vets', 'lust', 'deceit', 'betrayal', 'money', 'power', 'problem', 'was', 'lacked', 'compassion', 'affection', 'likeable', 'people', 'other', 'positive', 'characteristics', 'activities', 'make', 'show', 'worth', 'viewing.So', 'go', 'knowing', 'beforehand', 'melodramatic', 'dip', 'dirty', 'end', 'pool', 'may', 'like', 'are', 'hoping', 'something', 'more', 'smiles', 'sneers', 'something', 'closer', 'old', 'style', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'may', 'decide', 'just', ""n't"", 'grand']",The Grand - Complete Collection

1143909,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B0013NAMLK,Byron Kolln,"[2, 2]","For lovers of period drama, THE GRAND (originally broadcast in two series on ITV between 1997-98) is a rare treat.  Created and scripted by Russell T. Davies (""Queer as Folk""  and the current ""Doctor Who"" revamp), THE GRAND is a soapy drama set against the backdrop of Manchester at the dawn of the Roaring Twenties.  The title refers to the hotel owned and operated by the Bannerman family, Manchester's premiere accommodation spot, and a magnet for sex and scandal.As the series opens, John Bannerman (Michael Siberry) and his wife Sarah (Julia St. John) are busily overseeing preparations for the annual New Year's Eve ball, which is also being used as The Grand's re-opening after a long and expensive refurbishment.  The Bannerman's joy is heightened still when their son Stephen (Stephen Moyer, later played in the second series by Ifan Meredith) returns from the war earlier than expected, and the party becomes a welcome home gathering instead.  But the atmosphere changes when it's discovered that the hotel's chief financial backer has committed suicide after losing the Bannerman's capital in bad investments.  Salvation arrives in the form of John's slimy brother Marcus (Mark McGann) who agrees to bail out his relations, but in doing so causes more than a few ripples - firstly by threatening to close The Grand once and for all, and by constantly baiting Sarah into sleeping with him!Permanent guest Esme Harkness (Susan Hampshire) hides under the false faade of a privileged life in Kensington but in reality is an aging prostitute and brothel queen who still entertains her longtime clients and their various sexual proclivities.  Meanwhile downstairs, new maid Monica (Jane Danson), completely inexperienced in service--and life in general--pursues a friendship with Esme, but with dangerous and far-reaching consequences.Many fascinating characters make up the tapestry of the dramas within THE GRAND, chief among them long-time maid Kate Morris (Rebecca Callard, best remembered from her role of Arrietty in the BBC's ""Borrowers"" miniseries), floor manager Jacob Collins (Tim Healy); and salt-of-the-earth housekeeper Mrs Harvey (Christine Mackie).Naturally, coming from the pen of Russell T. Davies, the show is significantly more risque than the average period drama.  Susan Hampshire (previously the redoubtable Lady Glencora of ""The Pallisers"", and sweet Molly of ""Monarch of the Glen"") has the most outlandish part in the whole show.  As veteran lady of the night Esme, she's often called upon to writhe around in bed wearing black corsets and whip old codgers in quasi-bondage pose.  Quite the scene stealer!It takes the first two episodes in order to gather steam, but from there you'll be hooked!  High quality drama with a delicious period setting.

1143921,A3R8WGEBTZKH7N,B0013NAMLK,Hampsteader,"[4, 4]","I enjoyed Series One (first eight episodes) of The Grand. It had all the makings of a top-notch Edwardian period mini-series: a captivating story (with some good, albeit ""adult"" subplots), interesting characters, good acting, the requisite costumes and scenery an such. Even if it wasn't historically accurate, it was entertaining. (That said there was a bit of violence and gratuitous sexplay that I could have done without.)Then I started to watch Series Two and two of the main characters had been replaced by different actors (for the worse), which really disrupted the flow of the program and it never quite recovered for me. The first few episodes of the second series carried on with the main story line, but lacked the style and quality of Series One.Then THREE other main characters (and a few minor ones) were written out of the script completely leaving the plot floundering. The next several episodes struck me as somewhat disjointed in terms of story and style of writing, focusing on subthemes with individual characters and nearly ignoring the overall story of the Bannerman family.Towards the end, the focus shifted back to the main storyline and was building up to what I thought would be a good finale, but sadly I found the final episode lacking in every aspect - a true disappointment.I don't know the history of this story - if it was based in a book or what, but Series Two really felt like an afterthought or a poor attempt to carry on with something that had run its course.

1143922,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B0013NAMLK,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[96, 99]","This is 15 hours (18 episodes) of delightful English storytelling that takes place just after WWI.  You will be glad you have the complete series with no need to wait a week between each episode.  Each segment builds upon the next drawing you into the story as though you are part of the family of The Grand  hotel.It ranks along side series giants like The Pallisers, The Barchester Chronicles, and Monarch of the Glen.  Part of the reason might be that Susan Hampshire (3-Emmy winner) stars in all of those. She is outstanding in The Grand, playing Miss Harkness, a resident of the Grand, a prostitute, and proud of it. It takes a bit of acceptance, at first, seeing her as a lady of the evening,, instead of someone like Lady Glencora Palliser. Hampshire scores a perfect 10 for this performance.Mrs. Harvey, played by Christine Mackie, is the Grand's head housekeeper.  She acts and sounds quite like Gemma Jones in The Duchess of Duke Street.  In my opinion, Mackie performs equally as fine with her character as Harness, as Jones did as the Duchess. She keeps the downstairs servants in tow and in their working class place--or tries to (similar to Upstairs, Downstairs).  She and her counterpart, Mr. Jacob Collins, the hall porter (Tim Healy) are a huge part of the success of the stories linked together by the interconnected lives of the people who own, live and work at the Grand.Marcus Bannerman (Mark McGann) is a ruthless owner you'll soon learn to love to hate.It would take 18 reviews for the 18 episodes to tell the story.  Since that is impossible, let me say there is something for everyone: romance, rape, costumes, sex, blackmail, lavish sets, arson, child selling, comedy, prostitution, murder, elegance, greed, gays, a hanging, class struggle, embezzlement, gossip, lust, child selling, and fun 20's music.  If it's a sin or a pleasure, you'll encounter it through The Grand series. There are stories within a story.  Overall it's about the Bannerman family (3 generations) and their attempt to save the Grand from failure. For some the cost it to high. For others, success will come at any cost necessary.If you worry about the cost, divide the cost by the 18 episodes.  Each one is a movie in itself and every segment is top notch. This is another of a long line of outstanding productions of British drama. The box calls it ADDICTIVE. That is TRUE.That's the Pros. Now the Cons: The Grand ends with episode 18.

The Grand was not the right choice. First, you can pretty much predict where the story line is going from the first episode - a husband (nice but stupid) and wife (smart, ambitious, dissatisfied with her husband) run a hotel and are in major debt. The husband's sinister/envious brother loans him the money to save the hotel, which enables him to move in to the hotel in order to spend all of his spare time trying to divide his brother and sister in law, in order to have her all to himself. The wife knows his game and just barely puts up a small amount of resistance. There are lots of problems between the husband and wife and their children, snore... There were several R rated scenes, I guess with the absence of a good story and decent lines...The most interesting characters are the hotel staff - and there is a ridiculous, long in the tooth, prostitute who lives in the hotel and espouses the virtues of her profession to any maid that will listen.

1143932,A1J7HI27AO6HWO,B0013NAMLK,Lightspring2000,"[3, 3]","THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON THE GRAND: SERIES 1 AND SERIES 2.We have owned The Grand, The Complete Collection for about 8 years now. We have watched it over and over, and over. We showed it to relatives that visited us from the U.S. and they felt the same as we do. Susan Hampshire is excellent and not at all 'wooden' in my opinion. Of course she played a high class prostitute and the role called for her to be 'cool' at times. Susan portrayed whatever the role/character called for. We have The Grand and its sequel. My only complaint is the original actress who played 'Ruth' Marcus' wife did not return for the sequel. Although Marcus was a scoundrel, he came through a few times when help was needed. (It was surprising to learn that Mark McGann is the same actor as the mild mannered Eugene Wrayburn in Charles Dickens' ""Our Mutual Friend"" adaptation.) Back to The Grand: We loved the scene when he through Ruth's grandmother out of the Grand. I won't spoil it for others by stating his 'technique'. What a witch! The surprise ending was priceless. If we could rate The Grand 10 stars, we would.THE GRAND SERIES 2 continues with most of the same actors. It just gets better and better, surprising and more surprising as it moves along until the ultimate surprise ending!In some ways The Grand reminds me of the Leslie Uggams movie Backstairs at the White House. (Based on the true story of an African American maid (played by Olivia Cole) Lillian Rogers Parks who served there over 30 years through many presidencies. Her daughter (Leslie) took up where she left off. What 'goings on' there was!) She handled her personal life and each president and first lady with wisdom and finesse. The civility and kindness of a couple of Presidents and First Lady's was touching, especially concerning her daughter. (No spoiler here.) Definitely a 9-10 star. If not available here check on eBay.Another similar but very different account loosely based on fact is The Duchess of Duke Street. Oh my! the way the monarchy and aristocracy interfered in the ""Duchess'"" life was deplorable. Yet, it was a two way sword. This film gives great insight into the dynamics of Britain's monarchy and class distinctions. You have never seen or met anyone like outspoken Louisa, played by Gemma Jones as Louisa Trotter. She who works her way up from being a skivvy to being the Queen of cooks, cook to the King, and owner of the Bentinck Hotel in London.

1143934,A2MYRMQWSWGR29,B0013NAMLK,Mars Trader,"[4, 4]","I have mixed feelings about Russell T. Davies as a writer. He is extremely talented but I don't like his twists. Particularly some of the pedantic chaos he has brought to the new Dr. Who series.  I did read an interview about his experiences with The Grand and I will cut him a bit of slack because he said there was supposed to be a team of writers but that fell apart and he was left writing it all without having a plan.  I love the settings and costumes. I don't like the fact that no one gets ahead, as others have said someone seems to get torn down or killed in every episode. That's monotonous. Give me a break, sometimes someone has a good ending in their life. But then I didn't realize when I first started watching that this is considered soap opera, where catastrophe is constant. I think the cast changes in Episode 9 really stink. The new Ruth is not the same person at all as if the first season didn't exist. The new Stephen is a wimp. He has no presence at all compared to the original character. Clearly the casting could have done better, and RTD should respect the audience and coach the new characters to get into form rather than write to their weaknesses, which is what I believe he did. I grew to dislike St. John (Sarah) because she has only one expression on her face 90% of the time. This is a failure of the directorship. There is a good lesson here though about quality of life. The Victorian '20s were a time of opportunity between the wars. But the workers had no rights, unions weren't there to protect them, womens rights were scarce, and truly you could sink or swim at any social stratum as a result of a few mistakes.",4,Worth watching but has problems,1326240000,"01 11, 2012",2012,1654,"['have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'writer', 'extremely', 'talented', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'twists', 'Particularly', 'pedantic', 'chaos', 'brought', 'new', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'series', 'did', 'read', 'interview', 'experiences', 'Grand', 'will', 'cut', 'bit', 'slack', 'said', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'team', 'writers', 'fell', 'apart', 'was', 'left', 'writing', 'having', 'plan', 'love', 'settings', 'costumes', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'fact', 'one', 'ahead', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'someone', 'get', 'torn', 'down', 'killed', 'episode', 'monotonous', 'Give', 'break', 'sometimes', 'someone', 'good', 'ending', 'life', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'when', 'first', 'started', 'watching', 'considered', 'soap', 'opera', 'where', 'catastrophe', 'constant', 'think', 'cast', 'changes', 'Episode', '9', 'really', 'stink', 'new', 'Ruth', 'not', 'same', 'person', 'first', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'new', 'Stephen', 'wimp', 'presence', 'compared', 'original', 'character', 'Clearly', 'casting', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'RTD', 'should', 'respect', 'audience', 'coach', 'new', 'characters', 'get', 'form', 'rather', 'write', 'weaknesses', 'what', 'believe', 'did', 'grew', 'dislike', 'St.', 'John', 'Sarah', 'only', 'one', 'expression', 'face', '90', '%', 'time', 'failure', 'directorship', 'good', 'lesson', 'here', 'quality', 'life', 'Victorian', ""'20s"", 'were', 'time', 'opportunity', 'wars', 'workers', 'had', 'rights', 'unions', 'were', ""n't"", 'there', 'protect', 'rights', 'were', 'scarce', 'truly', 'could', 'sink', 'swim', 'social', 'stratum', 'result', 'few', 'mistakes']",The Grand - Complete Collection

None of that in this series.  There isn't one character that is likeable, not one, neither is there even an attractive one w/the exception of Susan Hampshire.  She has remained stunningly beautiful throughout her entire life.  The lead character, Marcus Bannerman, is so evil that he reminds me of Snidely Whiplash.  I was waiting for him to snicker ""Nyah ah ah!"".  His ridiculous wife is even worse.  Yes, I get that they're both damaged and deserve each other and had they revealed any redeeming qualities until the very end of the very last episode, perhaps I'd feel differently.  To make matters worse, they replaced the original actress w/an even worse one and they did the same w/the character Stephen, the son of the original owners of the Grand and not because they grew up and grew older; their reasons are their own, I guess.  I watched this pathetic piece of trash to the end because I was hoping that it would get better and that I'd at least get my money's worth.  It didn't and I didn't.

Obviously the intention was not to portray any sort of idealized microcosm of society as it might be represented by a prosperous British hotel of the 1920's;  instead what we get is a grand guignol rollercoaster ride through the evil motives and bad behavior which might occur at any time and place in human history.Anchoring this scary ride, fortunately, are four fearless performances by actors who dare us to identify with, or condemn, their characters: Susan Hampshire, obviously relishing her opportunity to play a naughty (but ultimately nice) girl who would certainly not be received by some of the ladies she has portrayed in other series; Mark McGann, so evil but needy that we would love to save him from himself, if only for the sake of his beautiful voice; Tim Healey, the moral center of this nasty universe but plagued by demons of his own; Rebecca Callard, the smallest and strongest person depicted, the first to aid others in distress, the last to stand up against the unkindest blow. Other actors are also excellent; every character is flawed, frustrated, complicated, capable of inconsistency, but none is beyond sympathy.This is not a pretty story.  At times it was pretty disgusting.  It was never boring. At the end I just wished there would have been another season to show how the old hotel would fare under the new regime.

1143940,AITI12BBKCYG9,B0013NAMLK,"N. Thomas ""LibraryFiend""","[4, 7]","**WARNING, WARNING** SPOILERS__SPOILERS__ MASSIVE SPOILERS__!!!The Grand was produced by Granada Television in 1997 and 1998. For anyone familiar with the venerable series The Duchess of Duke Street, The Grand endeavors to follow the same general idea of showcasing the lives of a large, fashionable hotel's owners, staff, and guests.  The series transpires in the Roaring Twenties during the years before the onset of the Great Depression.The Grand is a family-run enterprise. Brothers John Bannerman (Michael Siberry) and Marcus Bannerman (Mark McGann) have inherited the massive, Manchester, England-based hotel from their deceased father. Infrequent appearances are made by their imperious mother, Mary (Louie Ramsay), who muddles about without making much impact.John is married--at first, happily--to Sarah (Julia St. John). Marcus has his lady friend (and later, wife), Ruth, although the two seem to hate one another. The issue is Marcus' undying love for his brother's wife. Poor John is a total sucker and, in truth, a cuckold I found deeply unsympathetic.John and Sarah have two children: Stephen (played by Stephen Moyer of current True Blood fame in the first season, then repalced by the less charistmatic Ifan Meredith in the second series) and Adele (Camilla Power). At the beginning of the program Stephen has just returned from the British Army, having been stationed in France since the close of World War I. Adele is a petulant teenager whose presence is generally unnecessary.The Bannermans have plenty of infighting and Knots-Landing-esque slapdowns (literally) to keep the viewer entertained. But it's the rest of the hotel staff that makes The Grand great.Miss Esme Harkness is an elegant, upper-middle-aged woman who has made The Grand her permanent home. Mrs. Mary Bannerman, dimly remembering the lady's name but unable to pin down the context, badgers her for clues as to how she came into her money. Miss Harkness drops hints but never divulges anything outright--rather flimsily, it is soon established that she is a former prostitute and madame (who occasionally entertains clients in her rooms). Mary finally gets to the truth and confronts Miss Harkness, who brutally rebuffs her attacker's threats of eviction with a cool statement, ""Perhaps I'll tell the papers about me and Charlie"". Charles was, of course, Mary's late husband, the founder of the hotel, and a well-respected pillar of Mancunian society.Miss Harkness stays.Esme is played by veteran actress Susan Hampshire, a lifelong treasure of the BBC set, who starred in such epics as The Pallisers and The Barchester Chronicles.The hotel staff are governed by avuncular (if stoic) Jacob Collins (Tim Healy), the porter, and Miss Sylvie Harvey (Christine Mackie), head of housekeeping, who is quick-witted (if vinegar-tongued.) Mr. Collins' only child was executed for having gone A.W.O.L. from the British Army in France. Miss Harvey constantly refers to her husband, whom her subordinates sometimes doubt actually exists.One of the longest-serving maids is Kate Morris (Rebecca Callard), whose spritely adorableness is belied by her knowing nature. Monica Jones (Jane Danson) is brought on board early in the series and Kate trains her; Monica is soon the darling of Miss Harkness, who attempts to instruct the teenager in the ways of ladylike behavior (nothing seamy, mind). Daft Monica believes a visiting businessman has fallen in love with her and will take her away from her filthy job as a maid, only to have three of his associates attack her. Monica kills one of the men and is peremptorily sentenced to death for his murder.Appropriately enough, she is hanged on the very morning of Marcus' doomed nuptials to Ruth.Clive Evans (Paul Warriner) is head waiter and bartender at The Grand's restaurant and fights his same-sex inclinations as he succumbs to the seduction of a renowned theatrical guest. Poor Clive conceives a plan to try and romance the indomitable Kate in an effort to ""overcome"" his gayness. Lynne Milligan (Naomi Radcliffe) gives vaudeville a try before learning the show manager is only allowing her to sing onstage in the hopes of manipulating her to his own illicit ends. And all poor Brenda Potter (Maria Mescki) can seem to talk about is her mother and chocolate cookies.The drama of this series originates in much besides the sometimes down-and-dirty dealings among the Bannermans, the staff, and the guests. Raging social issues, such as class conflict, sexual education, incest, murder, unwed mothers, workers' rights, and adutlery (but to name a few!) erupt in every episode.But the cast of The Grand also rises above the horrors of inhumanity: Mr. Collins is enfolded in the warm support of the staff when he reaches a crisis of existence in facing his son's death. Kate tries--in vain--to steer Monica from the path of self-destruction on which she is bent. For all her shrill shrieking, Mrs. Harvey genuinely cares for the welfare of her girls, and often takes on the role of maternal surrogate in their lives. And reigning over them all is the piteous but benign Esme Harkness, whose faded beauty and gracious manners enchant (almost) everyone she meets.So if, for whatever reason, you're in the mood to lose yourself completely in superbly-crafted escapist entertainment, check into The Grand.",5,WELCOME TO THE GRAND,1226361600,"11 11, 2008",2008,5325,"['**WARNING', 'WARNING**', 'SPOILERS__SPOILERS__',

1143944,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B0013NAMLK,"Promise ""promise""","[6, 6]","This British soap opera had enough good actors to keep me watching through all of the episodes! My favorite was Mark McGan, an anti-hero to rival J.R.Ewing. He is the bad brother who we are supposed to hate, especially because he has the hots for his brother's wife, Sarah.  He plays most of the series with a captivating smirk, and his hands in his pockets.  Sarah, the good wife, is played by Julia St. John and I have to wonder why she was cast in the role, since she seems an unlikely person to capture the attention of her playboy brother-in-law.  She does seem to be ideally mated with John, the good brother, who is equally unattractive, boring, and self-righteous.  Marcus has a gorgeous, rich, smart girlfriend and again, one wonders just why he keeps letting his attention wander over to plain, dismal Sarah.Sarah and John have a son, Stephen, who has returned from WWI with a bad case of what we would now call PTSD, or at least we can blame  the war for his erratic behavior---sometimes sympathetic but mostly just a jerk.  His parents adore him and enable him to continue his irresponsible behavior, which is just one of the many annoying things about the plot.Then there is the staff, headed by a noble Jacob Collins, excellently played by Tim Healy.  He was one of the few characters who grabbed my genuine sympathy.  Another was the indomitable Kate, a tiny dynamo of a housemaid, with enough heart and soul to make up for the rest of the sorry bunch.  She was wonderfully played by Rebecca Collard.It was a pleasure to see the wonderful Susan Hampshire again, although her role as an honorable prostitute is sort of a stretch.The plot includes all sort of senstational trash, as other reviewers have mentioned. The ending, which I won't divulge, was really disappointing.  It's too bad that some very good actors' talent was wasted with this drivvel.",3,Not quite Masterpiece Theater,1263513600,"01 15, 2010",2010,1867,"['British', 'soap', 'opera', 'had', 'enough', 'good', 'actors', 'keep', 'watching', 'episodes', 'favorite', 'was', 'Mark', 'McGan', 'anti-hero', 'rival', 'J.R.Ewing', 'bad', 'brother', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'hate', 'especially', 'hots', 'brother', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'most', 'series', 'captivating', 'smirk', 'hands', 'pockets', 'Sarah', 'good', 'wife', 'played', 'Julia', 'St.', 'John', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'was', 'cast', 'role', 'unlikely', 'person', 'capture', 'attention', 'playboy', 'brother-in-law', 'seem', 'be', 'ideally', 'mated', 'John', 'good', 'brother', 'who', 'equally', 'unattractive', 'boring', 'self-righteous', 'Marcus', 'gorgeous', 'rich', 'smart', 'girlfriend', 'again', 'one', 'wonders', 'just', 'why', 'letting', 'attention', 'wander', 'plain', 'dismal', 'Sarah.Sarah', 'John', 'have', 'son', 'Stephen', 'who', 'returned', 'WWI', 'bad', 'case', 'what', 'would', 'now', 'call', 'PTSD', 'least', 'can', 'blame', 'war', 'erratic', 'behavior', 'sympathetic', 'mostly', 'just', 'jerk', 'parents', 'adore', 'enable', 'continue', 'irresponsible', 'behavior', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'annoying', 'things', 'plot.Then', 'staff', 'headed', 'noble', 'Jacob', 'Collins', 'excellently', 'played', 'Tim', 'Healy', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'characters', 'who', 'grabbed', 'genuine', 'sympathy', 'was', 'indomitable', 'Kate', 'tiny', 'dynamo', 'housemaid', 'enough', 'heart', 'soul', 'make', 'up', 'rest', 'sorry', 'bunch', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Rebecca', 'Collard.It', 'was', 'pleasure', 'see', 'wonderful', 'Susan', 'Hampshire', 'again', 'role', 'honorable', 'prostitute', 'sort', 'stretch.The', 'plot', 'sort', 'senstational', 'trash', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'divulge', 'was', 'really', 'disappointing', 'too', 'bad', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'talent', 'was', 'wasted', 'drivvel']",The Grand - Complete Collection

1143946,A2X22JBJXERVQD,B0013NAMLK,Sanity in SF,"[3, 5]","Great production values & strong acting despite inferior, agenda-driven  writing. For example, the permanent resident is elegantly played with dazzling warmth & charm that would have been a trademark of someone in her position. The hall porter is beautifully acted. An interesting period of social change & increasing social permeability. Yet, I agree completely with the reviewers who note this is written with a strong (& very dishonest) modern socio-political agenda. This cultural dishonesty & inauthenticity mars an otherwise lovely series written by very clever technicians - not artists. Charles Dickens they ain't & Upstairs Downstairs this ain't . . . If the writers insisted on portraying prostitution/homosexuality/gang rape etc. they should have ALSO portrayed genuine Christian faith & piety widespread in England in this period. But the agenda was neither historical nor artistic truth. Classic political tripe: enobling the working class while portraying the advantaged as uniformly unethical & greedy. Burdened with cliches: eg it's OK to sell your body to make money, but pursuing money in business makes you an automatic bore or bad guy; eg all ex-WWI soldiers are portrayed as wimps, criminals, cowards or neurotics--unless they're gay & then they're stable & likeable. Not an authentic or truthful work.Tantalizingly underdeveloped because the writers abandoned very rich characters & nascent storylines to score political points. Watch for Snidely Whiplash, Little Nell, etc. The agenda-driven writing isn't subtle. Characters typically aren't fully developed because they exist to score points the writers are intent on making. That leaves one vaguely dissatisfied as characters with fascinating potential come, go, languish or morph in somewhat cavalier fashion. A flawed & dishonest work with a strong socio-political agenda. That rankles & keeps The Grand from being first rate.Yet, if you love the visual beauty of lush English period dramas, if you can enjoy melodrama, and if you are willing to overlook the inappropriate intrusion of 21st century PC thought police, this can still be worthwhile. With such technical brilliance in production values it is a shame The Grand could not reach its own potential because its own creators had other agendas. The writers and producers should re-visit Shakespeare to learn how to tell a ripping story with a full range of human behaviors from noble to base that is still compassionate, culturally truthful, and complex. In The Grand, Iago -- and Uriah Heep, for that matter -- would have both been downtrodden victims and we the audience would have been clearly instructed to admire them for for their resiliency and get-up-and-go.There's much to appreciate here, but much to be ignored...",4,Underdelivers: had potential to be a timeless classic like Upstairs Downstairs,1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,2758,"['Great', 'production', 'values', 'strong', 'acting', 'inferior', 'agenda-driven', 'writing', 'example', 'permanent', 'resident', 'elegantly', 'played', 'dazzling', 'warmth', 'charm', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'trademark', 'someone', 'position', 'hall', 'porter', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'interesting', 'period', 'social', 'change', 'increasing', 'social', 'permeability', 'agree', 'completely', 'reviewers', 'who', 'note', 'written', 'strong', 'very', 'dishonest', 'modern', 'socio-political', 'agenda', 'cultural', 'dishonesty', 'inauthenticity', 'otherwise', 'lovely', 'series', 'written', 'very', 'clever', 'technicians', 'not', 'artists', 'Charles', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'ai', ""n't"", 'writers', 'insisted', 'portraying', 'prostitution/homosexuality/gang', 'rape', 'etc', 'should', 'have', 'ALSO', 'portrayed', 'genuine', 'Christian', 'faith', 'piety', 'widespread', 'England', 'period', 'agenda', 'was', 'historical', 'artistic', 'truth', 'Classic', 'political', 'tripe', 'enobling', 'working', 'class', 'portraying', 'advantaged', 'uniformly', 'unethical', 'greedy', 'Burdened', 'cliches', 'eg', 'OK', 'sell', 'body', 'make', 'money', 'pursuing', 'money', 'business', 'automatic', 'bore', 'bad', 'guy', 'ex-WWI', 'soldiers', 'are', 'portrayed', 'wimps', 'criminals', 'cowards', 'neurotics', ""'re"", 'gay', 'then', ""'re"", 'stable', 'likeable', 'Not', 'authentic', 'truthful', 'work.Tantalizingly', 'underdeveloped', 'writers', 'abandoned', 'very', 'rich', 'characters', 'nascent', 'storylines', 'score', 'political', 'points', 'Watch', 'Snidely', 'Whiplash', 'Little', 'Nell', 'etc', 'agenda-driven', 'writing', ""n't"", 'subtle', 'Characters', 'typically', 'are', ""n't"", 'fully', 'developed', 'exist', 'score', 'points', 'writers', 'are', 'intent', 'making', 'one', 'vaguely', 'dissatisfied', 'characters', 'fascinating', 'potential', 'come', 'go', 'languish', 'morph', 'somewhat', 'cavalier', 'fashion', 'A', 'flawed', 'dishonest', 'work', 'strong', 'socio-political', 'agenda', 'Grand', 'being', 'first', 'rate.Yet', 'love', 'visual', 'beauty', 'lush', 'English', 'period', 'dramas', 'can', 'enjoy', 'melodrama', 'are', 'willing', 'overlook', 'inappropriate', 'intrusion', '21st', 'century', 'PC', 'thought', 'police', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'such', 'technical', 'brilliance', 'production', 'values', 'shame', 'Grand', 'could', 'not', 'reach', 'own', 'potential', 'own', 'creators', 'had', 'other', 'agendas', 'writers', 'producers', 'should', 're-visit', 'Shakespeare', 'learn', 'how', 'tell', 'ripping', 'story', 'full', 'range', 'human', 'behaviors', 'noble', 'base', 'still', 'compassionate', 'culturally', 'truthful', 'complex', 'Grand', 'Iago', 'Uriah', 'Heep', 'matter', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'downtrodden', 'victims', 'audience', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'clearly', 'instructed', 'admire', 'resiliency', 'get-up-and-go.There', 'much', 'appreciate', 'here', 'much', 'be', 'ignored']",The Grand - Complete Collection

No, this is a serious 2 seasons delving into the hearts and souls of staff, owners, residents and guests at THE GRAND, a hotel in 1920's Manchester, England. This series have effected me in ways that a series like Selfridges has not. I have had strong emotional reactions to several episodes that lingered with me for days afterwards, causing me to contemplate cause and effect plus the great impact our specific time period has upon our lives. A couple pivotal episodes for me illustrate this.SPOILERS!  In one episode a staff member must face his youthful biological imperatives to find love/sex. But he is gay in 1920 England! The man is ethical and seeks love and a companion at a time when the only public displays of homosexuality entailed brief ""encounters in the night"": which tormented him with guilt and a sense of emptiness. This episode followed me for days, as I realized how restricted this man's choices were in 1920 England, when the nicest thing a person might say about being gay was that it was a horrible perversion worthy of jail time! What was a nice guy who happens to be gay do? Another pivotal episode for me involved a poor maid who sought to improve her station in life, but was raped by ""gentlemen"", killed one of them in a tirade of fear and rage, and (since rape was the woman's fault in 1920) was hung in the gallows at the age of 17. I actually mourned this character for days. This series is serious. There is charm galore and moments of great love and community between ""downstairs"" and ""upstairs"". I am just sorry this series ended after only 2 seasons. Evidently, some viewers found the topics a bit too close for comfort, preferring a lighthearted costume piece with trivial plots and nothing significant to linger in the mind.
