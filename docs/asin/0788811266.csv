Descriptions of the plots for these movies are already noted here, but I will say that both these films are very enjoyable family viewing.  I can remember going to the theater as a child and watching these films, and I still enjoy them today. Nobody's claiming they're the best films ever, or even the best Disney films ever, just good, fun entertainment in the grand Disney tradition.Some have complained about these films not being released in their original aspect ratio's, or being remastered for dvd.  Although I would have preferred them released letterboxed as well, neither film was released in a very wide aspect ratio, so they play fine on tv, and as for Disney using the same masters they used for the vhs releases and tv airings, if that's what they did, big deal.  Those prints are fine.  Sharp, clear pictures, with good color.Sure, it would have been nice to have remastered letterboxed versions on dvd, but be grateful we have them on dvd at all.

79696,A1Q1PP3Z4QDUQM,0788811266,Farffleblex Plaffington,"[16, 17]","The Barefoot Executive may appear to just be a light and fluffy 1960s/1970s-style Disney comedy, and it can certainly be enjoyed that way, but you don't have to dig very far below the surface to find a subtly clever satire of the television industry with a very insider feel.  Having worked in radio for a while, and having friends and family who do or did work in television, as well as reading a lot of behind the scenes books on television programs, a lot of the jabs at the industry feel spot on.The humorous premise, probably stemming from a common joke about this, is that a ""monkey"" (actually a chimpanzee here) could pick a television stations' programming and do just as good or even a better job at it.  Screenwriter Joseph McEveety and director Robert Butler get the dynamics between various levels of employees right, including the bigwigs.  There are nice, continuing threads of intertwined sycophancy, insular ideas, fears of getting canned or demoted over ratings or general incompetence, and self-righteous assertiveness.  Some of those things may be contradictory, but nevertheless they're representative of life within the walls of a broadcast media outlet--and probably many other places of employment as well.  To an extent, the personal dynamics aspects of The Barefoot Executive are suggestive of an early version of Office Space (1999).  But towards the end of the film, The Barefoot Executive nicely diverges into slightly more absurdist territory.Raffles, the chimpanzee, is charismatic and impressive.  But an unexpected surprise was the scope and chemistry of the cast, which includes veteran character actors and Disney regulars Joe Flynn and Harry Morgan, veteran television actor Wally Cox, the woman who has supplied the voice of Daphne in most of the Scooby-Doo series and animated films since 1970, Heather North, and in one of his first films, John Ritter.  Ritter is on fire here.  He steals almost every one of his scenes.  And that's quite a feat seeing that the star is an engaging Kurt Russell, who had already made a string of very successful films for Disney.",4,Excellent work from one of my favorite periods of live-action Disney films,1155772800,"08 17, 2006",2006,2100,"['Barefoot', 'Executive', 'may', 'appear', 'just', 'be', 'light', 'fluffy', '1960s/1970s-style', 'Disney', 'comedy', 'can', 'certainly', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'dig', 'very', 'far', 'surface', 'find', 'subtly', 'clever', 'satire', 'television', 'industry', 'very', 'insider', 'feel', 'Having', 'worked', 'radio', 'while', 'having', 'friends', 'family', 'who', 'do', 'did', 'work', 'television', 'as', 'well', 'reading', 'lot', 'scenes', 'books', 'television', 'programs', 'lot', 'jabs', 'industry', 'feel', 'spot', 'on.The', 'humorous', 'premise', 'probably', 'stemming', 'common', 'joke', 'monkey', 'actually', 'chimpanzee', 'here', 'could', 'pick', 'television', 'stations', 'programming', 'do', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'even', 'better', 'job', 'Screenwriter', 'Joseph', 'McEveety', 'director', 'Robert', 'Butler', 'get', 'dynamics', 'various', 'levels', 'employees', 'right', 'including', 'bigwigs', 'are', 'nice', 'continuing', 'threads', 'intertwined', 'sycophancy', 'insular', 'ideas', 'fears', 'getting', 'canned', 'demoted', 'ratings', 'general', 'incompetence', 'self-righteous', 'assertiveness', 'things', 'may', 'be', 'contradictory', 'nevertheless', ""'re"", 'representative', 'life', 'walls', 'broadcast', 'media', 'outlet', 'probably', 'many', 'other', 'places', 'employment', 'well', 'extent', 'personal', 'dynamics', 'aspects', 'Barefoot', 'Executive', 'are', 'suggestive', 'early', 'version', 'Office', 'Space', '1999', 'end', 'film', 'Barefoot', 'Executive', 'nicely', 'slightly', 'more', 'absurdist', 'territory.Raffles', 'chimpanzee', 'charismatic', 'impressive', 'unexpected', 'surprise', 'was', 'scope', 'chemistry', 'cast', 'veteran', 'character', 'actors', 'Disney', 'regulars', 'Joe', 'Flynn', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'veteran', 'television', 'actor', 'Wally', 'Cox', 'woman', 'who', 'supplied', 'voice', 'Daphne', 'most', 'Scooby-Doo', 'series', 'animated', 'films', '1970', 'Heather', 'North', 'one', 'first', 'films', 'John', 'Ritter', 'Ritter', 'fire', 'here', 'almost', 'one', 'scenes', 'quite', 'feat', 'seeing', 'star', 'engaging', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'who', 'had', 'already', 'made', 'string', 'very', 'successful', 'films', 'Disney']",N/A

79699,A14JEURPY1CXZB,0788811266,James D. Leverton,"[15, 23]","First of all, I must say ""The Barefoot Executive"", which was Kurt Russell's second starring role in his early Disney period, is a wonderful, comic farce.  It has a terrific supporting cast, including the hilarious comedy team of Joe Flynn and Wally Cox, an early appearance by the late John Ritter, and a pleasing turn by Heather North as Russell's love interest.  And then there's Russell's costar, a chimp who can predict hit TV shows, well-played by Bubbles.  His ""talent"" comes in handy when ambitious mailboy Russell uses his predictions to get ahead at the television network he works at.  In all, it's a funny farce that kids and their parents will enjoy.Alas, I cannot recommend this film for purchase at this time.  And here are five reasons why:1.  Disney DVD has once again made the head-scratching decision to release ""Barefoot Executive"" in a full-screen format, instead of widescreen.  Why?  Who knows.  This is extremely annoying, especially since it was undoubtedly filmed in the family friendly 1:66:1 aspect ratio.  Heck, my 3 year old niece has no problem with those black bars at the top and bottom of the screen.  Why should anyone else?2.  There is nothing to lead me to believe this film has been restored.  Therefore, we're evidently getting the same tired print from the VHS version.  Why replace something with something that is no better than what you already have?3.  There are absolutely no special features.  None.4.  The retail price of $19.99 is ridiculously expensive for a bare-bones DVD.  Most comparable DVDs are priced at $9.99 or less, so Disney should be ashamed of themselves for ripping the customer off.5.  As I said before, 1+2+3+4=ONE BIG RIPOFF.So, my verdict, thumbs down to Disney and this package.  I'd like to thank them, however, for saving me money.  Not buying this, ""Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N."", and ""Million Dollar Duck"" will save me anywhere from $45-$60 that I can use to buy product from other DVD companies, like Anchor Bay, for instance, that values its customers enough to present us with topnotch, worthy product.*** (out of *****)for the film; * for the DVD; ** overall",2,Five reasons to skip this one.,1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,2129,"['First', 'must', 'say', 'Barefoot', 'Executive', 'was', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'second', 'starring', 'role', 'early', 'Disney', 'period', 'wonderful', 'comic', 'farce', 'terrific', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'team', 'Joe', 'Flynn', 'Wally', 'Cox', 'early', 'appearance', 'late', 'John', 'Ritter', 'pleasing', 'turn', 'Heather', 'North', 'Russell', 'love', 'interest', 'then', 'Russell', 'costar', 'chimp', 'who', 'can', 'predict', 'hit', 'TV', 'shows', 'well-played', 'Bubbles', 'talent', 'handy', 'when', 'ambitious', 'mailboy', 'Russell', 'predictions', 'get', 'ahead', 'television', 'network', 'funny', 'farce', 'kids', 'parents', 'will', 'enjoy.Alas', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'film', 'purchase', 'time', 'here', 'are', 'five', 'reasons', 'why:1', 'Disney', 'DVD', 'once', 'again', 'made', 'head-scratching', 'decision', 'release', 'Barefoot', 'Executive', 'full-screen', 'format', 'instead', 'widescreen', 'Why', 'Who', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'especially', 'was', 'undoubtedly', 'filmed', 'family', 'friendly', '1:66:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'Heck', '3', 'year', 'old', 'niece', 'problem', 'black', 'bars', 'top', 'bottom', 'screen', 'Why', 'should', 'anyone', 'else', '2', 'nothing', 'lead', 'believe', 'film', 'been', 'restored', 'Therefore', ""'re"", 'evidently', 'getting', 'same', 'tired', 'print', 'VHS', 'version', 'Why', 'replace', 'something', 'something', 'better', 'what', 'already', 'have', '3', 'are', 'absolutely', 'special', 'features', 'None.4', 'retail', 'price', '19.99', 'ridiculously', 'expensive', 'bare-bones', 'DVD', 'Most', 'comparable', 'DVDs', 'are', 'priced', '9.99', 'less', 'Disney', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'ripping', 'customer', 'off.5', 'said', '1+2+3+4=ONE', 'BIG', 'RIPOFF.So', 'verdict', 'thumbs', 'down', 'Disney', 'package', ""'d"", 'like', 'thank', 'however', 'saving', 'money', 'Not', 'buying', 'Lt.', 'Robin', 'Crusoe', 'U.S.N', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Duck', 'will', 'save', 'anywhere', '45-', '60', 'can', 'use', 'buy', 'product', 'other', 'DVD', 'companies', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'instance', 'customers', 'enough', 'present', 'topnotch', 'worthy', 'product', '***', '*****', 'film', 'DVD', '**', 'overall']",N/A

79709,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,0788811266,Tim Janson,"[1, 3]","If it seems like Kurt Russell has been around forever it's because he HAS!  He's been acting since 1957.  He was 20 years old when he made this movie in 1951, but still was that fresh-faced kid we'd come to know in ""The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes"" done a few years before.  Although it seems like it since once again Joe Flynn is a co-star, this was not a part of the Dexter Riley series of films.  Other co-stars include Wally Cox, Harry Morgan, and an equally young John Ritter.Russell plays Steven Post who works in the mail room of a big television network.  Steven discovers that his girlfriend's pet chimp can pick TV ratings winners and soon as the network execs buzzing.  Joe Flynn and Wally Cox play off each other hilariously in this film.  Flynn was always so much fun to watch with that always perturbed look on his face and wondering ""why me?"".  Ritter actually plays the snobby nephew to the head of the studio who gets his just desserts in the end.Hey, these things were not classics but they were good and fun family movies the type of which you don't see anymore.  Disney did so well at these types of things in the 60's and early 1970's  Nice to see they are releasing them on DVD as well.",4,MORE FROM KURT'S EARLY DAYS,1112745600,"04 6, 2005",2005,1207,"['Kurt', 'Russell', 'been', 'been', 'acting', '1957', 'was', '20', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'made', 'movie', '1951', 'still', 'was', 'fresh-faced', 'kid', ""'d"", 'come', 'know', 'Computer', 'Wore', 'Tennis', 'Shoes', 'done', 'few', 'years', 'before', 'once', 'again', 'Joe', 'Flynn', 'co-star', 'was', 'not', 'part', 'Dexter', 'Riley', 'series', 'films', 'Other', 'co-stars', 'include', 'Wally', 'Cox', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'equally', 'young', 'John', 'Ritter.Russell', 'Steven', 'Post', 'who', 'mail', 'room', 'big', 'television', 'network', 'Steven', 'girlfriend', 'pet', 'chimp', 'can', 'pick', 'TV', 'ratings', 'winners', 'soon', 'network', 'execs', 'buzzing', 'Joe', 'Flynn', 'Wally', 'Cox', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'hilariously', 'film', 'Flynn', 'was', 'always', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'always', 'perturbed', 'look', 'face', 'wondering', 'why', 'Ritter', 'actually', 'snobby', 'nephew', 'head', 'studio', 'who', 'just', 'desserts', 'end.Hey', 'things', 'were', 'not', 'classics', 'were', 'good', 'fun', 'family', 'movies', 'type', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anymore', 'Disney', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'types', 'things', '60', 'early', '1970', 'Nice', 'see', 'are', 'releasing', 'DVD', 'as', 'well']",N/A
