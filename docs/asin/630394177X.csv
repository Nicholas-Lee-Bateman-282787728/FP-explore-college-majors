I'm glad it wasn't the FIRST one I bought because there are no instructions for the poses, but with a little experience from the beginner DVD's it is easy to follow. When I'm not totally sure what he means I can just look up at the screen and see what he's doing and I'm all set. I like how soothing the music is in this one and I also like how the segments are separate, but still can be played all together. Over all I really like this yoga practice. The only complaint I can come up with is that Rodney is wearing a lot less clothing than I am comfortable with. (Just an underwear cut pair of shorts.) But I don't look at the screen much when I am following along, so it's not really an issue.",5,Nice yoga DVD with lots of options.,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,748,"['do', 'yoga', 'morning', 'really', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', ""n't"", 'FIRST', 'one', 'bought', 'are', 'instructions', 'poses', 'little', 'experience', 'beginner', 'DVD', 'easy', 'follow', 'When', ""'m"", 'not', 'totally', 'sure', 'what', 'can', 'just', 'look', 'up', 'screen', 'see', 'what', 'doing', ""'m"", 'set', 'how', 'soothing', 'music', 'one', 'also', 'how', 'segments', 'are', 'separate', 'still', 'can', 'be', 'played', 'together', 'really', 'yoga', 'practice', 'only', 'complaint', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'Rodney', 'wearing', 'lot', 'less', 'clothing', 'am', 'comfortable', 'Just', 'underwear', 'cut', 'pair', 'shorts', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'screen', 'much', 'when', 'am', 'following', 'along', 'not', 'really', 'issue']",Yoga Practice for Energy VHS
390788,AOV2QYRBE51F3,630394177X,Aunt Lou,"[0, 0]","Although this DVD is promoted as 5 separate practices, it is only about 48 minutes long in total, and the 5 sections flow seamlessly into each other (although I found it best to turn my mat parallel to the TV to do the standing pose section).  The sections are:  opening stretches; standing poses; sun salutations/vinyasa with some backbends; forward bends; and shavasana.  If you do the whole thing, you'll get a well-rounded practice that works the entire body.There are some spots in the third section after the sun salutations that seem a bit choppy - you have to alternate very quickly between various standing poses and downward dog.  The poses don't flow naturally into each other and I found it a bit awkward to move back and forth quickly enough.  As other reviewers have said, the way he orders the standing poses is a bit unusual too -alternating left and right sides with successive poses rather than doing each on left and right and then moving on.  However, once I realized that was what he was doing, it was fine.I really like the fact that there is not a lot of talking.  Rodney simply names each pose, and you can focus on your breath and listen to the music in between.  I know this wouldn't be good for a total beginner, but if you know the poses and how to transition safely between them, I find it makes the practice more relaxing.",4,"Awkward in spots, but a good package",1392249600,"02 13, 2014",2014,1352,"['DVD', 'promoted', '5', 'separate', 'practices', 'only', 'about', '48', 'minutes', 'long', 'total', '5', 'sections', 'flow', 'seamlessly', 'other', 'found', 'best', 'turn', 'mat', 'parallel', 'TV', 'do', 'standing', 'pose', 'section', 'sections', 'are', 'opening', 'stretches', 'standing', 'poses', 'sun', 'salutations/vinyasa', 'backbends', 'forward', 'shavasana', 'do', 'whole', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'get', 'well-rounded', 'practice', 'entire', 'body.There', 'are', 'spots', 'third', 'section', 'sun', 'salutations', 'seem', 'bit', 'choppy', 'have', 'alternate', 'very', 'quickly', 'various', 'standing', 'poses', 'downward', 'dog', 'poses', 'do', ""n't"", 'flow', 'naturally', 'other', 'found', 'bit', 'awkward', 'move', 'back', 'forth', 'quickly', 'enough', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'way', 'orders', 'standing', 'bit', 'unusual', 'too', '-alternating', 'left', 'right', 'sides', 'successive', 'poses', 'rather', 'doing', 'left', 'right', 'then', 'moving', 'However', 'once', 'realized', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'was', 'fine.I', 'really', 'fact', 'not', 'lot', 'talking', 'Rodney', 'simply', 'pose', 'can', 'focus', 'breath', 'listen', 'music', 'know', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'total', 'beginner', 'know', 'poses', 'how', 'transition', 'safely', 'find', 'practice', 'more', 'relaxing']",Yoga Practice for Energy VHS
390789,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,630394177X,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[40, 41]","I've been practicing yoga with tapes for about 9 months now and consider myself to be an advanced beginner.  This tape was very different from any of the others I've tried, mainly because there was no narrative instruction.  The instructor, Rodney Yee, simply states the name of each pose, assuming that you are already familiar with the poses.  Therefore, this tape is NOT for beginners who have never done yoga before.  However, for those who have already learned the poses elsewhere, the difficulty of this tape is at a beginner or advanced beginner level.The five sections of the tape are designed to be performed throughout the day based on your needs.  The first, Awakening, is 9 minutes of mostly floor stretches and moves very slowly.  The second, Centering, is 7 minutes of relatively easy standing poses and is designed to be used in the morning.  The third and longest section (15 minutes) is Creativity.  This section is designed to be done during the day for energy, and it moves much more quickly than any of the other sections.  Although I enjoyed how Rodney flowed from one pose to the other, it moved a little too fast for me--for example, you must very quickly move from downward dog to a standing pose such as proud warrior.  One interesting thing was that the standing poses weren't just done on one side of the body and then the other.  For example, instead of doing proud warrior left and then proud warrior right, you do proud warrior left, then side stretch right, etc. in a whole sequence before eventually going back and reversing the sequence to do the moves on the other side.  Again, I liked the flow, but it moved very fast.The last two sections really are meant to be done together.  First is Reflection, which contains 11 minutes of seated forward bends for tranquility.  Finally comes Surrender, 4 minutes in relaxation pose.  This is the only time which Rodney provides more instruction, as he leads you through a guided relaxation.  At the END of the tape, Rodney talks about the purpose of the workout as well as how to modify the poses, so it would probably be helpful to watch this section first.  The scenery is a beautiful beach setting, and the music is softly new-agey (flutes, etc.).  For the three middle sections, Rodney has 1-2 others performing the routine along with him.Although I liked this video, it doesn't really meet my personal needs.  I think this workout would be best for someone who can purchase a DVD version, which would make it a lot easier to move between the different workouts.  If you are someone who would like to do different types of yoga routines at different times of the day, this tape would be for you.",4,Separate practices to meet different needs through the day.,1028160000,"08 1, 2002",2002,2675,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'practicing', 'yoga', 'tapes', 'about', '9', 'months', 'now', 'consider', 'be', 'advanced', 'beginner', 'tape', 'was', 'very', 'different', 'others', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'mainly', 'was', 'narrative', 'instruction', 'instructor', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'simply', 'name', 'pose', 'assuming', 'are', 'already', 'familiar', 'poses', 'Therefore', 'tape', 'NOT', 'beginners', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'done', 'yoga', 'However', 'who', 'have', 'already', 'learned', 'poses', 'elsewhere', 'difficulty', 'tape', 'beginner', 'advanced', 'beginner', 'level.The', 'five', 'sections', 'tape', 'are', 'designed', 'be', 'performed', 'day', 'based', 'needs', 'first', 'Awakening', '9', 'minutes', 'mostly', 'floor', 'stretches', 'moves', 'very', 'slowly', 'second', 'Centering', '7', 'minutes', 'relatively', 'easy', 'standing', 'poses', 'designed', 'be', 'used', 'morning', 'third', 'longest', 'section', '15', 'minutes', 'Creativity', 'section', 'designed', 'be', 'done', 'day', 'energy', 'much', 'more', 'quickly', 'other', 'sections', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'Rodney', 'flowed', 'one', 'pose', 'other', 'moved', 'little', 'too', 'fast', 'example', 'must', 'very', 'quickly', 'move', 'downward', 'dog', 'standing', 'pose', 'such', 'proud', 'warrior', 'One', 'interesting', 'thing', 'was', 'standing', 'poses', 'were', ""n't"", 'just', 'done', 'one', 'side', 'body', 'then', 'other', 'example', 'instead', 'doing', 'proud', 'warrior', 'left', 'then', 'proud', 'warrior', 'right', 'do', 'proud', 'warrior', 'left', 'then', 'side', 'stretch', 'right', 'etc', 'whole', 'sequence', 'eventually', 'going', 'back', 'reversing', 'sequence', 'do', 'moves', 'other', 'side', 'Again', 'liked', 'flow', 'moved', 'very', 'fast.The', 'last', 'two', 'sections', 'really', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'done', 'together', 'First', 'Reflection', '11', 'minutes', 'seated', 'forward', 'bends', 'tranquility', 'Finally', 'Surrender', '4', 'minutes', 'relaxation', 'pose', 'only', 'time', 'Rodney', 'more', 'instruction', 'guided', 'relaxation', 'END', 'tape', 'Rodney', 'talks', 'purpose', 'workout', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'modify', 'poses', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'helpful', 'watch', 'section', 'first', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'beach', 'setting', 'music', 'softly', 'new-agey', 'flutes', 'etc.', 'three', 'middle', 'sections', 'Rodney', '1-2', 'others', 'performing', 'routine', 'him.Although', 'liked', 'video', ""n't"", 'really', 'meet', 'personal', 'needs', 'think', 'workout', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'version', 'would', 'make', 'lot', 'easier', 'move', 'different', 'workouts', 'are', 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'do', 'different', 'types', 'yoga', 'routines', 'different', 'times', 'day', 'tape', 'would', 'be']",Yoga Practice for Energy VHS

The music is also very serene to help create a spacious atmosphere for doing yoga (there are some videos where the music is too oppressive).It has many different types of routines that can be used depending on your level of energy and differing needs.I would highly recommend it to anyone but would certainly getPatricia Walden's ""Yoga Practice for Beginners"" first in order to learn the basic yoga poses first.Other tapes I would recommend are ""Rainbeau Mars"" new 4 tape series ""Sacred Yoga"" which is a vinyasa flow style that has two more gentle tapes ""For Beginners"" and ""Pure Tranquility"" and then two more challenging tapes ""Pure Power"" and ""Pure Sweat"".  Then of course there's the excellent ""Total Yoga Flow Series"" by Tracey Rich and Ganja White which is a three tape set moving thru levels from more gentle to VERY challenging. These are fabulous tapes!Another recommendation I would make is Eric Schiffman's book ""Yoga, the practice of moving into stillness"" for an excellent guide to the ""internal"" practice of yoga. Also Donna Farhi's ""Yoga, Body Mind and Spirit is an amazing guide to making Yoga more internal and personal.

This superb Rodney Yee DVD is for one who knows the Yoga positions as this is done with little dialog and one is expected to be very familiar with Yoga. Each session is at a different time of the day. The first 2 sessions are my favorites in the morning and take just about 15 minutes. The 3rd one the Creativity lasts right at 16 Minutes (the longest, most difficult and the very fastest section). The last 2 sessions called Reflection (11 minutes) and Surrender (4 minutes) are my PM favorites. These were done on the DVD at SUNSET and these last 2 sessions, just 15 minutes total are wonderful to do in the PM after dinner and I have found that I am so relaxed and sleep wonderful after I have done these!

To be fair, I tried working out with this DVD several times, thinking that I might get into it.  It just doesn't work for me.  The biggest problem is the pace.  Was this seriously labelled as a 'high beginner' level?  Just try to keep up with the narration!  ""Up dog""...3 seconds later...""down dog""...  Unless your body is made of rubber, I don't see any ""beginning"" practitioners getting in and out of these postures that quickly...to say nothing of the safety.Another major drawback is the lack of advice or instruction.  Perhaps it was felt that this would be distracting for those who wanted to use this DVD to relax.  So the DVD relies heavily on some pretty garish visuals...tangerine colored beaches, purple ocean waves... and new age background muzak...windchimes and bells which become tiresome after 5 minutes or so.

390793,A2VREJW7HAWVUQ,630394177X,"Elizabeth Haynes ""Writer""","[2, 2]","I admittedly am a huge fan of Rodney Yee's style of yoga.  This video is an absolute new favorite!  The first segment is nice and slow, and relaxing, as are the last two segments.  The flowing segments in between are very fast moving.  I LOVE the minimal chatter.  I have never experienced a yoga DVD that simply stated the pose names, and will be seeking out more like this.  It was nice to be able to listen to the ocean waves and the music instead of chatter.  VERY conducive to really getting into your practice.Because there are only pose names and no constant instruction for breathing, you should have a familiarity with yoga poses before doing this DVD.  I only saw one pose that was maybe a bit challenging for a beginner, and you can just lay on your back and breathe during this time if you need to.Overall, a new favorite!  I don't often do longer practices but the time really flew for me on this one.  I didn't get as hard of a workout as his power yoga DVDs, but I did get a workout in the flowing sections.  Mostly I just felt great afterwards.  This is a really balanced practice with equal parts strength, balancing, lengthening, and relaxation.  Highly recommended!

390795,A25IWKZ3OYWPK8,630394177X,justplainkaren,"[5, 5]","This video is one the I use for my daily practice.  It's so nice not to hear verbal instruction -- that might be necessary for beginners, or the first few times you use a DVD, but after the 50th time you hear the same old stuff you feel like telling Rodney to ""Shut up!""  In this DVD, all you hear is the name of the pose -- which would be a disadvantage to absolute beginners.The first section ""Awakening"" is similar to the A.M. Yoga, or the ""Back Care"" section of the Healing tape in this same series.  Nice, easy stretches.The second section ""Centering"" is a nice flow series of standing poses.  It really gives me some much-needed help with balance.  You go through the series twice, first doing Tree to the right, then Triangle to the left, and so on through, Side Stretch, Warrior I and II, Half Moon, Warrior III, and Extended Leg Stretch.  It's the shortest routine on the DVD, but quite possibly the best.The third section, ""Creativity"" is the most difficult, and the one which seems to generate the most complaints.  It *is* fast; I think it's intended to be aerobic.  The worst part to me is that I simply can't make some of the transitions.  It is physically impossible for me to jump from dog pose to standing forward bend, for example, or to go directly from downward dog to Triangle.  Dog pose, or the plank-up dog-down dog sequence is used to transition between poses, and quite frankly, I usually just skip this and do the next pose. (Anyone who needs to use the blocks will not be able to keep up otherwise.) Things slow down towards the end, however.  I keep trying with this practice, but I skip it more frequently than any of the others on the DVD, and it's the reason I can't give it five stars.The fourth practice ""Reflection"" is virtually the opposite of the one before -- nice, slow seated forward bends.  You spend quite a long time in each one, and it's very relaxing.Finally, there's a short four-minute relaxation pose, the only practice where there's any narration.  I usually mute it at this point; if you don't, you'll find yourself rudely awakened by Rodney explaining the whole concept behind the Energy practice.Overall, it's a good everyday practice, and that's how I use it.

Yee says in the intro: ""The absence of verbal instruction allows you to focus on the movement, breath, emotions and energy you feel""Each activity corresponds to the 5 elements:Awakening to earth -- being grounded in the morning helps you engage with the day.Centering to water -- going with the flow helps you interact calmly with people.Creativity to fire -- getting things accomplished shakes stress out of your body.Reflection to air -- using the mind to recall the day and reflect on your attitudes helps you let go of strategies that aren't working.Surrender to ether -- putting your worries, concerns, and accomplishments out to the universe lets a higher power help you.You can use the video throughout the day or as a lovely 45 minute meditation to interact with the elements, your own body, and your attitudes in a process that leaves you calmer, more grounded, and more energized.my desire is for Rodney Yee to do another, more intensive video in this exact format of only stating the pose instead of the chatter",4,absence of verbal instruction is soothing,1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,1317,"['Great', 'advanced', 'beginners', 'intermediate', 'hatha', 'practitioners', 'dvd', 'verbal', 'instruction', 'merely', 'stating', 'what', 'pose', 'move', 'next.the', 'background', 'audio', 'lack', 'chatter', 'beautiful', 'video', 'make', 'very', 'soothing', 'combination', 'greatest', 'possible', 'stress', 'relief', 'Yee', 'intro', 'absence', 'verbal', 'instruction', 'focus', 'movement', 'breath', 'emotions', 'energy', 'feel', 'activity', '5', 'elements', 'Awakening', 'earth', 'being', 'grounded', 'morning', 'engage', 'day.Centering', 'water', 'going', 'flow', 'interact', 'calmly', 'people.Creativity', 'fire', 'getting', 'things', 'accomplished', 'shakes', 'stress', 'body.Reflection', 'air', 'using', 'mind', 'recall', 'day', 'reflect', 'attitudes', 'helps', 'let', 'go', 'strategies', 'are', ""n't"", 'working.Surrender', 'putting', 'worries', 'concerns', 'accomplishments', 'out', 'universe', 'higher', 'power', 'help', 'you.You', 'can', 'use', 'video', 'day', 'lovely', '45', 'minute', 'meditation', 'interact', 'elements', 'own', 'body', 'attitudes', 'process', 'calmer', 'more', 'grounded', 'more', 'energized.my', 'desire', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'do', 'more', 'intensive', 'video', 'exact', 'format', 'only', 'stating', 'pose', 'instead', 'chatter']",Yoga Practice for Energy VHS

The reason I even started doing Yoga was that severe degenerative arthritis began to impair my ability to do many of my favorite aerobics.  The very first DVD that introduced me to Yoga is Patricia Walden, Flexibility Yoga.  I highly recommend it as an introduction to Yoga.  It is very good.  She explains the poses in great detail.Yoga For Energy was the second DVD that I tried.  It was extremely challenging especially in the beginning.  I had sweat pouring off of me by the end of the session.  That has always been a gauge for a good workout.I love the fact that I can now do a backbend.  The mobility that I was losing from arthritis is returning.  My body definately responds well to this workout.  My collection of Yoga DVDs has grown.  I love most of them.  My favorites still include this one.  It still challenges me, but I love a good challenge.",5,This is the DVD that got me hooked on Yoga,1179964800,"05 24, 2007",2007,962,"['Exercise', 'one', 'passions', 'collection', 'videos', 'DVDs', 'huge', 'always', 'love', 'challenge', 'reason', 'even', 'started', 'doing', 'Yoga', 'was', 'severe', 'degenerative', 'arthritis', 'began', 'impair', 'ability', 'do', 'many', 'favorite', 'aerobics', 'very', 'first', 'DVD', 'introduced', 'Yoga', 'Patricia', 'Walden', 'Flexibility', 'Yoga', 'highly', 'recommend', 'introduction', 'Yoga', 'very', 'good', 'poses', 'great', 'detail.Yoga', 'Energy', 'was', 'second', 'DVD', 'tried', 'was', 'extremely', 'challenging', 'especially', 'beginning', 'had', 'sweat', 'pouring', 'end', 'session', 'always', 'been', 'gauge', 'good', 'workout.I', 'love', 'fact', 'can', 'now', 'do', 'backbend', 'mobility', 'was', 'losing', 'arthritis', 'returning', 'body', 'definately', 'well', 'workout', 'collection', 'Yoga', 'DVDs', 'grown', 'love', 'most', 'favorites', 'still', 'include', 'one', 'still', 'love', 'good', 'challenge']",Yoga Practice for Energy VHS

As Patricia Walden states in Yoga practice for Flexability, these tapes are supplemental to your weekly Yoga Practice! These tapes are very well done and really teach you the fundamentals of Yoga. And YES the third segement &quot;Creativity&quot; I believe, does seem to move quickly, BUT of ALL the segements, this one teaches the breath/body movements. I.E. one exhalation to get into the pose, then Inhale, exhale fully while moving into the next pose. THIS IS what YOGA IS.
