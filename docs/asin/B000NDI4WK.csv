Remember the Alka seltzer commercial where the guy is having a bad day and the water pours sideways into the glass ? Ernie Kovacs did this on early television by building a tilted set and having everything look upright by tilting the camera. Dick Shawn is the perfect schmuck in this film although his best is in the original Producers with Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder. A girl is pulling petals from a flower and saying &#34; er lieb mir, er lieb mir nichts, er lieb mir, er lieb mir nichts, Du lieb Mir Nichts !&#34; Dick Shawn as Hitler says , &#34;I lieb ya, I lieb ya baby, now lieb me alone&#34;. This film has that same screwball approach to comedy.

What is unique is that even though major actors were picked for the movie they could not be closer to the character description from the 1959 book of the same name by Howard Singer.Russ is a schnook. Therefore if something can go wrong it will. His wife is into insurance of all kinds. She wants him to get his GI insurance while he can. After she forces him to apply (schnook), he must explain that he has two serial numbers (schnook). When he was shot down over Germany he was presumed dead and needed a second number to get discharged (schnook). So naturally realizing that the (schnook) being in the service only one-day on the second serial number, is called up to finish his time.He ends up on an island in the middle of the Sea of Japan. There he has a revelation that saves his sanity and that of 400 other servicemen. A plan so brilliant that I am not about to tell you what it is or how it is executed.In the book the plan cured his shnookyness; in the movie it takes a trial. The cast includes Dick Shawn as the schnook and Ernie Kovacs as his commander and hotshot fighter pilot.I can relate to this as I also have two serial numbers.Wake Me When It's Over by Howard Singer",5,Only schnooks rush in,1201046400,"01 23, 2008",2008,1250,"['film', 'book', 'few', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'exceptions', 'What', 'unique', 'even', 'major', 'actors', 'were', 'picked', 'movie', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'closer', 'character', 'description', '1959', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Howard', 'Singer.Russ', 'schnook', 'Therefore', 'something', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'will', 'wife', 'insurance', 'kinds', 'get', 'GI', 'insurance', 'can', 'apply', 'schnook', 'must', 'explain', 'two', 'serial', 'numbers', 'schnook', 'When', 'was', 'shot', 'down', 'Germany', 'was', 'presumed', 'dead', 'needed', 'second', 'number', 'get', 'discharged', 'schnook', 'naturally', 'realizing', 'schnook', 'being', 'service', 'only', 'one-day', 'second', 'serial', 'number', 'called', 'up', 'finish', 'time.He', 'up', 'island', 'middle', 'Sea', 'Japan', 'revelation', 'sanity', '400', 'other', 'servicemen', 'plan', 'so', 'brilliant', 'am', 'not', 'tell', 'what', 'how', 'executed.In', 'book', 'plan', 'cured', 'shnookyness', 'movie', 'trial', 'cast', 'Dick', 'Shawn', 'schnook', 'Ernie', 'Kovacs', 'commander', 'hotshot', 'fighter', 'pilot.I', 'can', 'relate', 'also', 'have', 'two', 'serial', 'numbers.Wake', 'Me', 'When', 'Over', 'Howard', 'Singer']",N/A

1056475,ADFJMD98M5HLM,B000NDI4WK,C. Andrews,"[0, 0]","Mustered out in 1946, an ex-tail gunner and POW who owns a Jersey city tavern and country hotel applies for GI insurance at the last possible moment in 1953, and gets caught up in the Air Force Reserves.  He is put through radar school and winds up on the fictional Japanese island of Shima after the Korean war, with a decrepit base and a dirt airstrip, and a radar dish located up the mountain.He finds that his former B-17 captain is the C.O. of the remote outpost, and that most of their time is spent finding creative ways to keep from dying of boredom. The local population largely ignores them and honors the memory of a crash landed wartime Japanese aviator.Airman Brubaker comes up with the morale building and money making idea of building a hotel at the local hot springs to serve the military en route, and attract the men and women stationed in post war Japan on leave.  The base men can do private work in their after duty hours, and the stockpiled materiel from the Korean conflict can be put to constructive use.After they scam a doctor/journalist at a medical conference in Tokyo to convince him that the springs have health benefits, he becomes disgruntled and writes an expose that gets the attention of the public and Washington that gets them in real hot water.  A droll comedy about military bureaucracy, foreign relations and economic aid in the Cold War.There is a short sequence of the C.O. buzzing the base and landing his P-51 on one wheel.  There are a couple of short shots of a C-47 delivering supplies, and the government investigating committee.  The Japanese shrine appears to be built over the carcass of a PT-17 or other fixed wheel trainer.",4,Note to aviation enthusiasts,1385683200,"11 29, 2013",2013,1676,"['Mustered', 'out', '1946', 'ex-tail', 'gunner', 'POW', 'who', 'Jersey', 'city', 'tavern', 'country', 'hotel', 'applies', 'GI', 'insurance', 'last', 'possible', 'moment', '1953', 'caught', 'up', 'Air', 'Force', 'Reserves', 'put', 'radar', 'school', 'up', 'fictional', 'Japanese', 'island', 'Shima', 'Korean', 'war', 'decrepit', 'base', 'dirt', 'airstrip', 'radar', 'dish', 'located', 'up', 'mountain.He', 'former', 'B-17', 'captain', 'C.O', 'remote', 'outpost', 'most', 'time', 'spent', 'finding', 'creative', 'ways', 'keep', 'dying', 'boredom', 'local', 'population', 'largely', 'honors', 'memory', 'crash', 'landed', 'wartime', 'Japanese', 'aviator.Airman', 'Brubaker', 'up', 'morale', 'building', 'money', 'making', 'idea', 'building', 'hotel', 'local', 'hot', 'springs', 'serve', 'military', 'en', 'route', 'attract', 'men', 'women', 'stationed', 'post', 'war', 'Japan', 'leave', 'base', 'men', 'can', 'do', 'private', 'work', 'duty', 'hours', 'stockpiled', 'materiel', 'Korean', 'conflict', 'can', 'be', 'put', 'constructive', 'use.After', 'scam', 'doctor/journalist', 'medical', 'conference', 'Tokyo', 'convince', 'springs', 'have', 'health', 'benefits', 'disgruntled', 'expose', 'attention', 'public', 'Washington', 'real', 'hot', 'water', 'droll', 'comedy', 'military', 'bureaucracy', 'foreign', 'relations', 'economic', 'aid', 'Cold', 'War.There', 'short', 'sequence', 'C.O', 'buzzing', 'base', 'landing', 'P-51', 'one', 'wheel', 'are', 'couple', 'short', 'shots', 'C-47', 'delivering', 'supplies', 'government', 'investigating', 'committee', 'Japanese', 'shrine', 'be', 'built', 'carcass', 'PT-17', 'other', 'fixed', 'wheel', 'trainer']",N/A

Crabtree ""Doc Crabtree""","[5, 5]","I had not seen this movie in ages and I was not disappointed.I first saw this film as a teenager, before I joined the military, and thought it was funny. Having seen it after years in the Army I found it HILARIOUS. The thing is, former Airman Brubaker KNOWS that applying for G.I. insurance is a mistake... he got out of the Army Air Force after spending almost his entire time in a German POW camp. Yet his wife wants him to apply and like a schnook he does. Then, naturally, due to an error that came up when he was discharged the Air Force drafts him and quickly processes him through radar training and sends him to one of the many backwaters that the U.S. military ran during the Cold War.If you've never seen this film you owe it to yourself to see this!",4,Kovacs contributes to this great comedy,1379030400,"09 13, 2013",2013,760,"['had', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'ages', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed.I', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'teenager', 'joined', 'military', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'Having', 'seen', 'years', 'Army', 'found', 'HILARIOUS', 'thing', 'former', 'Airman', 'Brubaker', 'KNOWS', 'applying', 'G.I', 'insurance', 'mistake', 'got', 'out', 'Army', 'Air', 'Force', 'spending', 'almost', 'entire', 'time', 'German', 'POW', 'camp', 'wife', 'apply', 'schnook', 'Then', 'naturally', 'due', 'error', 'came', 'up', 'when', 'was', 'discharged', 'Air', 'Force', 'drafts', 'quickly', 'radar', 'training', 'one', 'many', 'backwaters', 'U.S.', 'military', 'ran', 'Cold', 'War.If', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'owe', 'yourself', 'see']",N/A
