673659,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B00005Q4CV,"Andre M. ""brnn64""","[4, 11]","I finally saw the whole thing, after occasionally seeing parts of it on TV for years. Jackie Gleason and Richard Pryor were my favorite comedians, but this time they go together like ice cream and mustard.The first half of the film is a sad parade of some of the most unlikable characters in a ridiculously stupid premise. A crude tycoon (Gleason) tries to buy his son's affection by offering him anything he wants. He picks an unemployed African American loser (Richard Pryor) as a toy. Pryor goes through some really degrading and sad ""comedy (pathetic abuse is more like it) at the hands of the bratty kid and the biogted father, before things are rectified (I won't spoil it by saying how) in the end.Both of these otherwise great comedians' talents are squanderd here. Gleason is no Gigot, Ralph Kramden, or Poor Soul here. This is one of his flattest and unfunniest roles. His villany here is so coldly delivered that it is not even of the darkly comical moustache twirling Snidely Whiplash variety. At one particularly low point, the Gleason character (U.S. Bates) shows his power to Pryor by forcing his employee (Ned Beatty) to take down his pants during their conversation. ""That,"" says Gleason pointing to the degraded Beatty, ""is reality."" Are you busting your guts with laughter yet? Pryor even does a ""walk this way"" gag early in the film that was hoary even in Abbott and Costello's time.Pryor is far below his best as Mudbone or Grover Muldoon who talked much trash and took no mess from anyone. Here, he is a pitiful simp of a man who whines and whimpers throughout most of the first 3/4 of the film. He continually returns to the degredation of the father and son's abusive antics when the Gleason character increases his pay. No dignity. More patheic than funny.The kid is so obnoxious and unconvincing that it is difficult for the viewer to sympathize with his supposed lack of love at the hands of his unrelentingly mean father. We are expected to accept the idea that Pryor feels sorry for this monstorous brat and gets him to change his ways. Come on! This kid would make even Gandhi  and Martin Luther King go after him with a belt!I've always said that bad drama can make for good comedy but band comedy is good for nothing. This is truly the case here unless you want to use the DVD for target practice at the rifle range.Some people find this film funny.

It's one of those films that's &quot;never quite as funny as all that&quot; but Pryor and Schwartz turn in good performances with eventually likeable characters.  The friendship they form is great.  Makes you feel good.Scott Schwartz, who plays Gleason's son Eric, said he wrote a sequel himself but it's difficult to take him seriously for obvious (and painful) reasons.  He went on to do adult films but mostly as the comic relief.  You might remember him in A Christmas Story as the kid who sticks to the flagpole.The anamorphic video on this DVD is top notch.

Dillard,"[0, 1]","In The Toy Pryor gets to stretch his acting skills somewhat and there's the crazy zany moments but there also some serious moments here too but not enough to turn this into a dramatic overload film. The film's premise has been criticized for it's subject matter, but I think if Richard thought at any point it was crossing the line or racists I'm sure he would've been the first one to walk away from it and let someone know at the sametime. He must have realized the humor of it all from the script or he would have never agreed to be involved in my opinion. The film is funny and moves at a pace that doesn't get bogged down or boring in any way. Richard's interaction with Scott Schwartz who plays 'Eric Bates' is great. Scott plays the spoiled rich kid to a 'T'. Jackie Gleason puts in a nice performance here as well. He plays a rich, pretentious windbag snob, and does it well. Ned Beatty is great here too, though his screen time is limited. Teresa Ganzel who plays ditzy 'Fancy Bates' really pulls off that 'Dumb Blonde' routine well without overdoing it. I searched for Blu Ray reviews on the interwebs before I made the purchase as I already have the DVD and didn't want to spend more money on a substandard transfer of it. The reviews I read were spot on and the Blu Ray looks fantastic and is easily an upgrade over the DVD version. One of my favorite Pryor films along with 'Moving' so getting this very clean and high quality Blu Ray version makes watching the film for the umpteen time so much more enjoyable than before.

673681,A3DY46ZABF4CMQ,B00005Q4CV,"S. Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[4, 4]","In the early 80's, controversial African American comedian Richard Pryor (See No Evil Hear No Evil) was in top form. He was the most influential and electrifying stand-up comic, and one of the highest paid black actors in Hollywood (Pryor was reportedly paid $4,000,000 to appear in 1983's Superman III).In 1982, Pryor agreed to star opposite the legendary Honeymooners star Jackie Gleason (Smokey And The Bandit), in a remake of a 1976 French film titled Le Jouet, which literally means The Toy in english. The outcome was a classic comedy, although hated by many critics, that is still enjoyed and quoted by people today.The Toy is directed by Richard Donner (Superman), and also stars Ned Beatty (Superman), Wilfrid Hyde-White (My Fair Lady), Teresa Ganzel (Monsters Inc), and child actor Scott Schwartz (Kidco).Pryor plays Jack Brown, a struggling and unemployed black writer who will lose his house if he fails to pay $10,000 to pay off his mortgage. Jack finds himself stooping down the social ladder trying to get any job he can get in order to save himself from getting thrown into the street. He finds a job as a cleaning lady for the Bates firm and is hired by Mr. Morehouse, played by Beatty. When local millionaire US Bates, played by Gleason, finds out that one of his cleaning ladies has a moustache, he fires him. To make matters worse, Bates's spoiled little bratty son 'master' Eric Bates, played by Schwartz, arrives in town for a week with his dad, goes to his dad's toy store, and picks out Jack as his toy because he made him laugh. Eric's insistence on keeping Jack and his dad's pampering reults in US negotiating a deal with Jack on the basis that he stays for a week at his mansion to keep his son company. US and Jack go on a collision course over different issues: the amount that Jack needs, US's degrading and racist new wife Fancy Bates, played by Ganzel, and most of all, what the film really focuses on, is how to approach and win over his son.The Toy is a delightful movie despite what many regard it as being Pryor's and Gleason's low points. In fact, The Toy is one of the funniest films and an excellent pairing for both actors.RecommendedA",5,No tomorrow. No next week. No next month. No next year.

For some reason, I found it unusually engrossing. Maybe it was the dumb hijinks of Richard Pryor and his spoiled-rich-kid 'playmate' (Scott Schwartz). Or perhaps it was Fancy's (Teresa Ganzel) gratuitous cleavage in every other scene she appeared in, thus kickin' up my prepubescent hormones a few notches. Whatever the reason, I made sure the channel clicker was set for the HBO channel whenever this silly little flick came on.Looking at it as an adult, though, I cannot fathom what I ever saw in this movie. To me, the funniest part was the fact that Schwartz eventually ended up workin' in the porn biz. Actually, Ned Beatty dropping his pants on the orders of the kid's oil-tycoon dad (Jackie Gleason) in one scene was pretty entertaining too. It was sortuva tribute to his first pants-dropping role in 'Deliverance', which I consider one of the greatest unintentionally hilarious moments in cinema history. But, despite my bewilderment concerning my childhood enjoyment of 'The Toy', I'll often watch it whenever it pops up on cable, if for nothing more than the nostalgia factor.'Late",3,A prime example of my strange childhood tastes,1009670400,"12 30, 2001",2001,1200,"['remember', 'watching', 'Toy', 'as', 'often', 'could', 'whenever', 'popped', 'up', 'cable', 'back', 'when', 'was', ""young'un"", 'reason', 'found', 'unusually', 'engrossing', 'Maybe', 'was', 'dumb', 'hijinks', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'spoiled-rich-kid', ""'playmate"", 'Scott', 'Schwartz', 'perhaps', 'was', 'Fancy', 'Teresa', 'Ganzel', 'gratuitous', 'cleavage', 'other', 'scene', 'appeared', 'thus', 'kickin', 'up', 'prepubescent', 'few', 'notches', 'reason', 'made', 'sure', 'channel', 'clicker', 'was', 'set', 'HBO', 'channel', 'whenever', 'silly', 'little', 'flick', 'came', 'on.Looking', 'adult', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'what', 'ever', 'saw', 'movie', 'funniest', 'part', 'was', 'fact', 'Schwartz', 'eventually', 'ended', 'up', 'workin', 'porn', 'biz', 'Actually', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'dropping', 'pants', 'orders', 'kid', 'oil-tycoon', 'dad', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'one', 'scene', 'was', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'too', 'was', 'sortuva', 'tribute', 'first', 'pants-dropping', 'role', ""'Deliverance"", 'consider', 'one', 'greatest', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'cinema', 'history', 'bewilderment', 'concerning', 'childhood', 'enjoyment', ""'The"", 'Toy', ""'ll"", 'often', 'watch', 'whenever', 'up', 'cable', 'nothing', 'more', 'nostalgia', 'factor', ""'Late""]",N/A
