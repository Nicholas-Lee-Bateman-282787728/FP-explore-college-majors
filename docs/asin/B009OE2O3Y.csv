1601014,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B009OE2O3Y,Robert Badgley,"[3, 3]","This is Sea Hunt Season Four;its last season.It went out with a bang,as this one was one of the best of the bunch.Along for the ride,among many other stalwarts,were Beau Bridges,Kenneth Toby(starred in the original The Thing),Victor Buono,Ted Knight,Sue Randall,Bruce Dern and on the last ep Jack Nicholson.Also I MUST give mention to an actor who appeared on this show more than any other,yet someone I have neglected to give a shout out to in previous season reviews.His name was Ken Drake.You will know him as a guy of average height but skinny.He played everything from villain,to good guy,from farmer to swamp man.He did it all and was a valuable asset to the entire company and the quality of the shows.As I said the shows just got better.Lloyd Bridges played a double of himself in one,and there is another where the show spoofs itself.Within this particular ep Lloyd is watching a show called Dempsey of the Deep.It is a corny soap opera that features a scuba diver who fights crime.Of course it has the usual stereotypical soap opera music playing along with it.Very funny.It is ironic that in its day Sea Hunt was described as just that;a scuba diver who fights crime.But that couldn't have been farther from the truth.Lloyd's character Mike Nelson was always on a job either at home or far away,working privately or a government.It was usually circumstances he had no control over that drew him into conflicts with others,that he would have to resolve.Also this last season saw Lloyd's character fleshed out even more as we see him alot as a Commodore in the Coast Guard reserves.It also saw the program being filmed alot in Nassau,and Lloyd doing more and more of his own work underwater.Lamar Boren is the man responsible for the great underwater photography and Ricou Browning and Courtney Brown were the guys responsible for overseeing the underwater sequences;the latter usually subbing for Lloyd when required.Watch for some eps in this set when they fade to what would originally have been a commercial.You will see the faint lettering of""place commercial here"".Technically speaking the picture quality is spectacular,but there are,like other seasons,sound drop outs occasionally.I don't know whether this is a manufacturing problem or inherent in the master tapes used.Most come and go so quickly it usually doesn't affect things too much.Like the other seasons there are no extras.In conclusion this is the last season of a show that I recall with great fondness.Lloyd Bridge's great acting and affable personality sold this show for four long years.Sea Hunt did more than any other show before or since,in getting folks interested in the recreational hobby of scuba diving.Safety was always front and center in this show,without ever being preachy.I can remember when the last ep,those many,many years ago,saw Lloyd sailing away from my viewing experience for what I thought would be the last time(home video and DVDs were far,far into the future).It was like saying goodbye to an old friend.Now,with the ""miracle"" of DVD,I can return to those memorable days anytime I want.Thank you Mr Bridges....wherever you are.",5,Sea Hunt-cut off in its prime,1374537600,"07 23, 2013",2013,3136,"['Sea', 'Hunt', 'Season', 'Four', 'last', 'season.It', 'went', 'out', 'bang', 'one', 'was',

1601017,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B009OE2O3Y,trebe,"[4, 5]","The fourth and final season of Sea Hunt (1961) might be the most exciting yet, as Lloyd Bridges stars as ex-Navy diver Mike Nelson, a member of the Coast Guard Auxiliary, and free lance scuba diver, who continues to become involved in a wide variety of adventures in, around, and under the sea.  Created by Ivan Tors (Flipper,Daktari), Sea Hunt was an action oriented and suspenseful series, that had helped stimulate the popularity of scuba diving, ever since the program had debuted in 1958.Although the ruggedly handsome Bridges had been new to scuba when the series began, by year four he was a pretty experienced diver, who was in top physical shape.  He was seldom doubled in the underwater scenes, which contributes to the program's sense of realism.  Shot at various places during its run, for this season the Bahamas was the primary location, and the program features some wonderful picturesque settings that stand out, even for being filmed in black and white.The technology available at the time to utilize special effects was rather limited, and Sea Hunt is particularly notable, for featuring real divers using scuba gear in the ocean.  Often featured swimming or diving, many of the guest stars are younger and physically fit.  The narration that Bridges provides during the underwater sequences, is an essential storytelling tool, providing vital information about what is happening onscreen, especially during a crisis.The storylines are quite diverse and run the gamut, from recreational activities, to salvage operations, scientific research, helping friends, to various missions and clandestine operations for the government.  Life is seldom dull for Mike Nelson, a man whose charm and quiet confidence, makes it feel as though he belongs, almost anywhere in the world.  While there are many lovely females present, Nelson mostly stays focused on business, with little time devoted to romance.Failing to follow procedures and take proper precautions, can often be fatal at sea, and safety is always a point of emphasis on Sea Hunt.  While it might be easier to fake fighting underwater, for the most part, the physical realities of the ocean environment, could not be easily discounted.  While creative and intended to be dramatic, the writing still usually contains elements of logic, science, and common sense, that makes for a more well-grounded story, than your average cop show.Although it was still doing fairly well in the ratings, Sea Hunt was cancelled after four seasons, and 155 episodes.  Many in the crew that Ivan Tors gathered together, would also work on the series Flipper, including Ricou Browning, who had played the Creature from the Black Lagoon.If you are familiar with Sea Hunt, you won't be disappointed by the level of action and excitement contained in season four.  Old school tough, Lloyd Bridges is rock solid as a dashing man of action, finishing his four year run as Mike Nelson in top form.  With so much being shot on location, the production schedule must have been a killer, as typical for the time, this season featured a staggering 38 episodes.  The image quality of this 2013 MGM release is outstanding, as the transfers look remarkably good, for a program over 50 years old.  If you like TV from this era and haven't checked out Sea Hunt, you just might want to give it a watch.",5,Sea Hunt winds up its underwater run in top form...,1370908800,"06 11, 2013",2013,3336,"['fourth', 'final', 'season', 'Sea', 'Hunt', '1961', 'might', 'be', 'most', 'exciting', 'yet', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'ex-Navy', 'diver', 'Mike', 'Nelson', 'member', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'Auxiliary', 'free', 'lance', 'scuba', 'diver', 'who', 'become', 'involved', 'wide', 'variety', 'adventures', 'sea', 'Created', 'Ivan', 'Tors', 'Flipper', 'Daktari', 'Sea', 'Hunt', 'was', 'action', 'oriented', 'suspenseful', 'series', 'had', 'helped', 'stimulate', 'popularity', 'scuba', 'diving', 'ever', 'program', 'had', 'debuted', '1958.Although', 'ruggedly', 'handsome', 'Bridges', 'had', 'been', 'new', 'scuba', 'when', 'series', 'began', 'year', 'four', 'was', 'pretty', 'experienced', 'diver', 'who', 'was', 'top', 'physical', 'shape', 'was', 'seldom', 'doubled', 'underwater', 'scenes', 'program', 'sense', 'realism', 'Shot', 'various', 'places', 'run', 'season', 'Bahamas', 'was', 'primary', 'location', 'program', 'wonderful', 'picturesque', 'settings', 'stand', 'out', 'even', 'being', 'filmed', 'black', 'white.The', 'technology', 'available', 'time', 'utilize', 'special', 'effects', 'was', 'rather', 'limited', 'Sea', 'Hunt', 'particularly', 'notable', 'featuring', 'real', 'divers', 'using', 'scuba', 'gear', 'ocean', 'featured', 'swimming', 'diving', 'many', 'guest', 'stars', 'are', 'younger', 'physically', 'fit', 'narration', 'Bridges', 'underwater', 'sequences', 'essential', 'storytelling', 'tool', 'providing', 'vital', 'information', 'what', 'happening', 'onscreen', 'especially', 'crisis.The', 'storylines', 'are', 'quite', 'diverse', 'run', 'gamut', 'recreational', 'activities', 'salvage', 'operations', 'scientific', 'research', 'helping', 'friends', 'various', 'missions', 'clandestine', 'operations', 'government', 'Life', 'seldom', 'dull', 'Mike', 'Nelson', 'man', 'charm', 'quiet', 'confidence', 'feel', 'almost', 'anywhere', 'world', 'are', 'many', 'lovely', 'females', 'present', 'Nelson', 'mostly', 'focused', 'business', 'little', 'time', 'devoted', 'romance.Failing', 'follow', 'procedures', 'take', 'proper', 'precautions', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'fatal', 'sea', 'safety', 'always', 'point', 'emphasis', 'Sea', 'Hunt', 'might', 'be', 'easier', 'fake', 'fighting', 'underwater', 'most', 'part', 'physical', 'realities', 'ocean', 'environment', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'easily', 'discounted', 'creative', 'intended', 'be', 'dramatic', 'writing', 'still', 'usually', 'elements', 'logic', 'science', 'common', 'sense', 'more', 'well-grounded', 'story', 'average', 'cop', 'show.Although', 'was', 'still', 'doing', 'fairly', 'well', 'ratings', 'Sea', 'Hunt', 'was', 'cancelled', 'four', 'seasons', '155', 'episodes', 'Many', 'crew', 'Ivan', 'Tors', 'gathered', 'together', 'would', 'also', 'work', 'series', 'Flipper', 'including', 'Ricou', 'Browning', 'who', 'had', 'played', 'Creature', 'Black', 'Lagoon.If', 'are', 'familiar', 'Sea', 'Hunt', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'level', 'action', 'excitement', 'contained', 'season', 'four', 'Old', 'school', 'tough', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'rock', 'solid', 'dashing', 'man', 'action', 'finishing', 'four', 'year', 'run', 'Mike', 'Nelson', 'top', 'form', 'so', 'much', 'being', 'shot', 'location', 'production', 'schedule', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'killer', 'typical', 'time', 'season', 'featured', 'staggering', '38', 'episodes', 'image', 'quality', '2013', 'MGM', 'release', 'outstanding', 'transfers', 'look', 'remarkably', 'good', 'program', '50', 'years', 'old', 'like', 'TV', 'era', 'have', ""n't"", 'checked', 'out', 'Sea', 'Hunt', 'just', 'might', 'want', 'give', 'watch']",N/A
