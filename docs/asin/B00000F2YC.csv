497112,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,B00000F2YC,Genevieve Hayes,"[0, 7]","After thoroughly enjoying the first season of ""The Magnificent Seven"", I eagerly proceeded to the second season. However, the second season is nowhere near as fun as the first. The first season episodes were made in the spirit of the good, old-fashioned western, with no deep issues to get in the way of the action. It was the sort of thing that the whole family could enjoy. Yet, for reasons that are entirely beyond me, in the second season, the writers decided to introduce a look of psychological issues: slavery, rape, infidelity, J.D.'s guilt after killing a man... Not to mention the fact that someone working on this series has a major axe to grind against Irish-Catholics. I am not surprised that the show was cancelled after this season. By the time I got to the end of it, I didn't want to watch any more either.This boxed set contains the 13 episodes of season two, packaged in slim-line cases. There are no special features included on the DVDs.",2,The first season was so good.

I am ashmaed to say that I didn't watch it that much when it came out in 1998. That is why such a fine series died, it didn't find its audience.  The second season really drives home how well this series would have been if it had been allowed to go on.  The stories are better and the characters are given more to do and allow to develope as full people. In the second season each is given time in each story to build their character.  The last show on the disc where Chris finally finds his wife killer was one that you wouldn't expect to find in a tv western. It was showed the back groud of Chris.  Buck learned what true beauty was and Josiah explains golf so that all can understand it.
