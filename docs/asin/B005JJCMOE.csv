1463220,A1O1HWFO5Q9PJ0,B005JJCMOE,"A. J. ""adahl-Korean drama enthusiast""","[2, 2]","This series is very good, but the subtitles get weird and more Chinese than Korean in the translation to English. The names suddenly which were Korean become Chinese. This happens at the most crucial part in the story and stays that way for the last 3rd of the series. Big bummer. Also, I bought both series thinking they were different. Now I am out the money. Very disappointed in this. Buyer beward. I don't know how to check in the future, but between a contact at Ya Entertainment, and a good contact at RollingDonut2, maybe I will get help in future purchases.Marry Me Mary and Mary Stayed Out All Night - same drama - two titles, two different boxes.",3,"Duplicate of another drama, Mary Stayed Out All Night",1336348800,"05 7, 2012",2012,657,"['series', 'very', 'good', 'subtitles', 'get', 'weird', 'more', 'Chinese', 'Korean', 'translation', 'English', 'names', 'suddenly', 'were', 'Korean', 'become', 'Chinese', 'most', 'crucial', 'part', 'story', 'stays', 'way', 'last', '3rd', 'series', 'Big', 'bummer', 'Also', 'bought', 'series', 'thinking', 'were', 'different', 'Now', 'am', 'out', 'money', 'Very', 'disappointed', 'Buyer', 'beward', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'check', 'future', 'contact', 'Ya', 'Entertainment', 'good', 'contact', 'RollingDonut2', 'maybe', 'will', 'get', 'help', 'future', 'Me', 'Mary', 'Mary', 'Stayed', 'Out', 'All', 'Night', 'same', 'drama', 'two', 'titles', 'two', 'different', 'boxes']",Marry Me Mary

1463223,A2ZF8C6UJ4F6VA,B005JJCMOE,Nigel R. Ralphs,"[4, 4]","Without having been, without knowing the language, I have become a great fan of South Korea's TV shows; especially from KBS.I caught much of the series when it was on a Northern Virginia cable channel of Korean TV - then they switched show providers to one without subtitles.Duh.I looked, I found, I purchased. The show has it's expected twists and turns, you soon learn who wears the white hat and who wears the gray. The lead character, Wi Mary, is as adorable as anything and twice as cute. The male lead is boring and should not be in the show.I say this because Mary stole my heart and he gets to be with her in the show! Unfair! Unfair!It's a good and long drawn out series with drama and plenty of humor. And, it has a plot! (long is good in this case as you get to know all the cast that much better)Take a chance. If you are an American (I'm from Britain living in the US) you are deprived of so much overseas entertainment. Trust me, there is more out there than the British comedies and dramas on PBS or BBC America.Buy it, pop it in the DVD player, and enjoy your ride.",5,Mad about Korean TV,1355270400,"12 12, 2012",2012,1081,"['having', 'been', 'knowing', 'language', 'have', 'become', 'great', 'fan', 'South', 'Korea', 'TV', 'shows', 'especially', 'KBS.I', 'caught', 'much', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'Northern', 'Virginia', 'cable', 'channel', 'Korean', 'TV', 'then', 'switched', 'show', 'providers', 'one', 'subtitles.Duh.I', 'looked', 'found', 'purchased', 'show', 'expected', 'twists', 'turns', 'soon', 'learn', 'who', 'white', 'hat', 'who', 'gray', 'lead', 'character', 'Wi', 'Mary', 'as', 'adorable', 'anything', 'twice', 'cute', 'male', 'lead', 'boring', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'show.I', 'say', 'Mary', 'stole', 'heart', 'be', 'show', 'Unfair', 'Unfair', 'good', 'long', 'drawn', 'series', 'drama', 'plenty', 'humor', 'plot', 'long', 'good', 'case', 'get', 'know', 'cast', 'much', 'better', 'Take', 'chance', 'are', 'American', ""'m"", 'Britain', 'living', 'US', 'are', 'deprived', 'so', 'much', 'overseas', 'entertainment', 'Trust', 'more', 'there', 'British', 'comedies', 'dramas', 'PBS', 'BBC', 'America.Buy', 'DVD', 'player', 'enjoy', 'ride']",Marry Me Mary
