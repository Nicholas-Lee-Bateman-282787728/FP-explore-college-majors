This hit the spot.It's only 24 moves, some of which can be changed to suit your students. Most of my students can learn the basic of the 24 m oves in three to four months which give them a sense of accomplishment.",5,Excellent program for seniors,1306022400,"05 22, 2011",2011,348,"['learned', 'long', 'form', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'teenager', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'trying', 'find', 'program', 'was', 'easy', 'learn', 'seniors', 'hit', 'spot.It', 'only', '24', 'moves', 'can', 'be', 'changed', 'suit', 'students', 'Most', 'students', 'can', 'learn', 'basic', '24', 'm', 'oves', 'three', 'four', 'months', 'give', 'sense', 'accomplishment']",N/A

This video presents the Yang style short form, with very clear and detailed instructions. Dr. Lam and his students have won competitions in China, which is a good sign, but not necessarily a guarantee of an instructor's ability to teach, but I believe the teaching on this video is quite good.Dr. Lam also has a Sun style tai chi video which is different from the Yang style in that it incorporates moves from ba gua and hsing i, the two other internal boxing arts besides tai chi, and even shaolin kung fu. The Chen style of tai chi also has more shaolin-like movements, and fast movements and high kicks, which were eliminated from the Yang style form in favor of slower, more flowing movements for reasons of health and so less healthy and fit people could do the form and benefit from it. This was done by Yang Cheng Fu early in the last century. Anyway, if you're looking for something a little different in the way of a tai chi video then I can recommend Dr. Lam's video on the Sun style also.One final comment. If you can, eventually you should try to learn the long form of your style in addition to the short form. Many tai chi masters don't think much of the short forms because they don't think they provide the full health benefits. My own teacher, who is admittedly very traditional, feels this way. This issue aside, the long forms do represent the original art and if you are so inclined, I would recommend you learn the long form too just for your own knowledge and development. You can always do the short form when you don't have the time for the long one. I finally learned the long Yang form (I studied Wu style originally) and am very happy I did.Whichever way you decide to go, this is a good video from Dr. Lam. Good luck and happy tai chi practicing!",5,Excellent video,1132704000,"11 23, 2005",2005,1856,"['older', 'tai', 'chi', 'video', 'now', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'there', 'video', 'Yang', 'style', 'short', 'form', 'very', 'clear', 'detailed', 'instructions', 'Dr.', 'Lam', 'students', 'have', 'won', 'competitions', 'China', 'good', 'sign', 'not', 'necessarily', 'guarantee', 'instructor', 'ability', 'teach', 'believe', 'teaching', 'video', 'quite', 'good.Dr', 'Lam', 'also', 'Sun', 'style', 'tai', 'chi', 'video', 'different', 'Yang', 'style', 'moves', 'ba', 'gua', 'hsing', 'i', 'two', 'other', 'internal', 'boxing', 'arts', 'tai', 'chi', 'even', 'shaolin', 'kung', 'fu', 'Chen', 'style', 'tai', 'chi', 'also', 'more', 'shaolin-like', 'movements', 'fast', 'movements', 'high', 'kicks', 'were', 'eliminated', 'Yang', 'style', 'form', 'favor', 'slower', 'more', 'flowing', 'movements', 'reasons', 'health', 'so', 'less', 'healthy', 'fit', 'people', 'could', 'do', 'form', 'benefit', 'was', 'done', 'Yang', 'Cheng', 'Fu', 'early', 'last', 'century', 'Anyway', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'way', 'tai', 'chi', 'video', 'then', 'can', 'recommend', 'Dr.', 'Lam', 'video', 'Sun', 'style', 'also.One', 'final', 'comment', 'can', 'eventually', 'should', 'try', 'learn', 'long', 'form', 'style', 'addition', 'short', 'form', 'Many', 'tai', 'chi', 'masters', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'short', 'forms', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'provide', 'full', 'health', 'benefits', 'own', 'teacher', 'who', 'admittedly', 'very', 'traditional', 'feels', 'way', 'issue', 'aside', 'long', 'forms', 'do', 'represent', 'original', 'art', 'are', 'so', 'inclined', 'would', 'recommend', 'learn', 'long', 'form', 'too', 'just', 'own', 'knowledge', 'development', 'can', 'always', 'do', 'short', 'form', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'long', 'one', 'finally', 'learned', 'long', 'Yang', 'form', 'studied', 'Wu', 'style', 'originally', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'did.Whichever', 'way', 'decide', 'go', 'good', 'video', 'Dr.', 'Lam', 'Good', 'luck', 'happy', 'tai', 'chi', 'practicing']",N/A

I had purchased this DVD as an adjunct to my weekly Tai Chi classes at a local school of martial arts.This DVD is not a substitute for taking Tai Chi classes, but rather it is to supplement classes and to help you review and practice what you have learned.I had also purchased a DVD by Robin Linde, which I felt was more appropriate to my needs than Dr. Lam's DVD.  I do not mean to denigrate or malign Dr. Lam.  I just feel that the DVD by Robin Linde was more suited to my needs.A good Tai Chi collection should include a number of DVDs of the simplified Yang style form.
