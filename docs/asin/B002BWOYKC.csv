1260344,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B002BWOYKC,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[9, 14]","I enjoy this series about the behind the scenes living for those in the Hollywood rat race. The entourage is everyone who is sustained in Hollywood, in part of in whole, by major Hollywood movie star, Vinnie Chase.  For me personally, the most enjoyable aspect this season was the further depiction of Vinnie's agent Ari Gold (by multiple Emmy winner for this role, Jeremy Piven), his assistant, Lloyd, and the supposedly lesser acting brother, Drama, played by Kevin Dillon.  This is the first time I so fully enjoyed the Drama character but he was given many more dimensions this season.  Those dimensions were more than ably brought out by Dillon, who before this has always toiled in the real life shadow of his own actor brother, Matt Dillon.  I think Kevin Dillon has finally come into his own as an actor. Another thing done by the show that mimics real life is that Kevin Dillon was always the not so spectacular looking brother (to real life Matt) just like his character is to the fictional Vinnie (Adrien Griener).  I applaud the creators for giving us such a richly ironic portrayal.  Lloyd has to do battle this season with Ari to try and make it as an agent himself rather than remaining Ari's eternal assistant.  Ari also has brought in another partner who is hilarious as he almost ruins Ari's business as his marriage comes apart, with both marital partners acting out semi-violently at the agency. This partner almost steals the whole show when he runs his car through his lavish house in order to secure a client (it works!).  I enjoy the other characters less on this show but that is a personal preference which may be entirely different from your own.

Vinnie Chase hits it big, Turtle gets a girlfriend, E is full of angst, and Johnny Drama frequently steals the show with his over-the-top antics. Ari Gold, super agent, gets a little too mean, a little too bombastic, but he redeems himself at the very end. And that's what his character and the show needed most. Of all the characters, Ari makes the biggest transition. Even Turtle gets a girlfriend, an important Hollywood star herself. So, the characters get to grow a little, if they don't actually grow up. Vince is the one who gets lost in the woods as his friends BEGIN to find lives of their own, at last. The trajectory of the show continues toward ever bigger things, which is a nice turn after the disappointments of the business they all went through in the previous season. Johnny Drama, though, is the best, his character almost turns his back on Hollywood, which any sane person in his position would do. But he shows his true stripes in stunning fashion at the end, and that was the best episode for him, one that really gave his character the depth he needed.

Vince is on top again with the Martin Scorcese movie 'Gatsby' and due to a delay with his next movie, it gives Vince some serious downtime.  E has branched out, as he closes his Murphy group and winds up taking a job setup by his ex. Good growth for the E character here.  Drama begins to have problems on his hit show 'Five Towns' as the producer of the show says he will have sex with Turtle's girlfriend (Jaime-Lynn Sigler). This scenario results in some hilarious situations. I don't buy the Turtle/Sigler relationship. The writers weakly explain it as her therapist said that she is 'attracted to losers'. Huh? whatever. A flailing attempt to expand the character of Turtle (when in fact he is a third fiddle character). Just have him drive Vince around and smoke weed, there is nothing more to Turtle than that.  Ari's ego and power increases in this season as does his torturing of the long suffering Lloyd.

Eric's story line in fantastic in this season, as well as uncovering much more about Turtle.

1260355,A211TYB51TIZ6Q,B002BWOYKC,"J. McQueen ""Anti-Charisma""","[3, 5]","In the past two days, I watched this particular season of Entourage from start to finish and came away impressed.In the past few seasons, there have been some excellent story arcs, but rarely (outside of Ari Gold) any character development, nor any substantial change in the characters' status. In this season, nearly every major character's life changes for better or for worse.It seems that the writers, particularly Ally Musika, have made a concerted effort to ensure that the series starts moving forward at a quicker pace.The addition of Gary Cole to the cast (starring as an agent in Ari Gold's agency) injected some much-needed drama into the script. Cole's character, Andrew Klein, is a paradox - he's a magnetic rainmaker whom, unlike Ari, has absolutely no sense of self-preservation. Klein, either consciously or unconsciously, does everything he can to undermine his reputation, his personal life and his self-esteem.  Simultaneously, he does everything he can to validate all of the sacrifices Ari made to bring him into the agency. The internal conflict between his latent self-hatred and his longing to be loved by his peers is fascinating.This season shows many of the supporting characters attempting to discover who they are - professionally, romantically and philosophically. Johnny Drama, Turtle and Lloyd are all given more to do than they have in past seasons and this is a good thing. Lloyd has to decide whether or not to remain in Ari Gold's manically paternalistic shadow or stake his own claim. Drama, in the midst of a career revival, struggles to control the strange impulses that have damaged his career over and over again. Turtle is a doubly-kept man - the star, Vincent Chase, has always ""had his back"" and his girlfriend, Jamie Lynn Siegler, a star in her own right, has shielded Turtle from the ""real world"" as well. At age 30, his dilemma is similar to Lloyd's in that he must decide if ""making it on his own"" is truly worth it - Is it better to be a weaker, kept man with all of your needs attended to or a stronger man who may suffer death by a thousand cuts through life myriad setbacks and indignations?  (As an aside, the final two episodes of this season were probably Turtle's dramatic best.)Without spoiling anything, E's life in this season is shaken in every conceivable way imaginable. In my opinion, he seems to be becoming the person he hates the most - a less educated, less profane (but increasingly as cynical) version of Ari Gold.My only reservation of this season is the mysterious lack of character development of Vincent Chase. But, perhaps his character is not developing because Vince is not capable of growth. There is a brilliant scene early in the season (where Vince sprawls on a couch like Don Draper from ""Mad Men"") that makes you wonder about his future. While he no longer seems destined to eventually inhabit the same career purgatory of his brother, Drama, there is this developing solitariness to him that we didn't see in prior seasons. It begs the question ""what happens to Vince's Peter Pan when his cadre of Lost Boys grows up and leaves the island of Lost Toys (models, cars, random trips) for the world of grown-ups?"" Does the alluring cipher that is Vincent Chase simply cease to exist? And is it just me or is Vincent Chase's character quiet fade from the show (we seem to see less and less of him evey season) an expression of everyone else's growth and his stunted development?Obviously, I really enjoyed the season and I hope you do, too!",4,"The Agent, the Assistant, the Lost Boys and the Enigma",1277337600,"06 24, 2010",2010,3518,"['past', 'two', 'days', 'watched', 'particular', 'season', 'Entourage', 'start', 'finish', 'came', 'away', 'past', 'few', 'seasons', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'story', 'arcs', 'rarely', 'Ari', 'Gold', 'character', 'development', 'substantial', 'change', 'characters', 'status', 'season', 'nearly', 'major', 'character', 'life', 'changes', 'better', 'worse.It', 'writers', 'particularly', 'Ally', 'Musika', 'have', 'made', 'concerted', 'effort', 'ensure', 'series', 'moving', 'forward', 'quicker', 'pace.The', 'addition', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'cast', 'starring', 'agent', 'Ari', 'Gold', 'agency', 'injected', 'much-needed', 'drama', 'script', 'Cole', 'character', 'Andrew', 'Klein', 'paradox', 'magnetic', 'rainmaker', 'whom', 'Ari', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'self-preservation', 'Klein', 'either', 'consciously', 'unconsciously', 'everything', 'can', 'undermine', 'reputation', 'personal', 'life', 'self-esteem', 'Simultaneously', 'everything', 'can', 'validate', 'sacrifices', 'Ari', 'made', 'bring', 'agency', 'internal', 'conflict', 'latent', 'self-hatred', 'longing', 'be', 'loved', 'peers', 'fascinating.This', 'season', 'many', 'supporting', 'characters', 'attempting', 'discover', 'who', 'are', 'professionally', 'romantically', 'philosophically', 'Johnny', 'Drama', 'Turtle', 'Lloyd', 'are', 'given', 'more', 'do', 'have', 'past', 'seasons', 'good', 'thing', 'Lloyd', 'decide', 'not', 'remain', 'Ari', 'Gold', 'manically', 'paternalistic', 'shadow', 'stake', 'own', 'claim', 'Drama', 'midst', 'career', 'revival', 'control', 'strange', 'impulses', 'have', 'damaged', 'career', 'over', 'again', 'Turtle', 'doubly-kept', 'man', 'star', 'Vincent', 'Chase', 'always', 'had', 'back', 'girlfriend', 'Jamie', 'Lynn', 'Siegler', 'star', 'own', 'right', 'shielded', 'Turtle', 'real', 'world', 'as', 'well', 'age', '30', 'dilemma', 'similar', 'Lloyd', 'must', 'decide', 'making', 'own', 'truly', 'worth', 'better', 'be', 'weaker', 'kept', 'man', 'needs', 'attended', 'stronger', 'man', 'who', 'may', 'suffer', 'death', 'thousand', 'cuts', 'life', 'myriad', 'setbacks', 'indignations', 'aside', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'season', 'were', 'probably', 'Turtle', 'dramatic', 'best', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'E', 'life', 'season', 'shaken', 'conceivable', 'way', 'imaginable', 'opinion', 'be', 'becoming', 'person', 'most', 'less', 'educated', 'less', 'profane', 'increasingly', 'cynical', 'version', 'Ari', 'Gold.My', 'only', 'reservation', 'season', 'mysterious', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'Vincent', 'Chase', 'perhaps', 'character', 'not', 'developing', 'Vince', 'not', 'capable', 'growth', 'brilliant', 'scene', 'early', 'season', 'where', 'Vince', 'couch', 'Don', 'Draper', 'Mad', 'Men', 'wonder', 'future', 'no', 'longer', 'destined', 'eventually', 'inhabit', 'same', 'career', 'purgatory', 'brother', 'Drama', 'developing', 'solitariness', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'prior', 'seasons', 'question', 'what', 'Vince', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'when', 'cadre', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'up', 'island', 'Lost', 'Toys', 'models', 'cars', 'random', 'trips', 'world', 'grown-ups', 'alluring', 'cipher', 'Vincent', 'Chase', 'simply', 'cease', 'exist', 'just', 'Vincent', 'Chase', 'character', 'quiet', 'fade', 'show', 'seem', 'see', 'less', 'less', 'evey', 'season', 'expression', 'everyone', 'else', 'growth', 'stunted', 'development', 'Obviously', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'season', 'hope', 'do', 'too']",N/A

The show is entourage. It works when it focuses on the guys together and how they interact. Turning it into a personal growth and relationship show is a very bad idea.

1260361,AOLHE547CHOTX,B002BWOYKC,Michael Profit,"[0, 1]","As the title suggests, season six develops in a manner much different than previous seasons. Yet while these changes stray from the normal theme of Entourage, the results still provide an entertaining, well written television season.This change of direction exists to the benefit of the show's other main characters, who are given the opportunity to develop and shine on their own. Ordinarily, Vince is the center of attention, with the main story arc centered around him and his career. With season six, however, ""Vince drama"" is limited only to the first few episodes. The grand premiere of ""Gatsby,"" Vince's latest movie, gives viewers the impression that the film is a success. Apart from that, very little screen time is dedicated to Vince's career. In one episode, we learn that the start date for filming Vince's latest movie has been significantly delayed; this is perhaps a not so subtle hint by the show's writers that attention to Vince will be delayed too.In the meantime, Eric undergoes a career transformation that better allows him to emerge from under the ""Vincent Chase shadow."" This story line is enjoyable and shows Eric's potential as a professional talent manager in a top-notch firm. Conversely, Eric's other main story line, his relationship with his neighbor Ashley, proves to be irritating, and is the season's weak point.Drama, my favorite character, undergoes a similar career transformation throughout the season, and his character holds much promise for next season. Kevin Dillon's acting is spot-on as usual, providing both hilarity and emotional depth.Turtle undergoes the biggest character transformation of all, shedding the slacker, unmotivated image he has held throughout the series. This is easily Jerry Ferrara's best season acting wise, and hopefully he will continue to progress as a character.Ari is Ari, as usual, and his relationship with Lloyd takes center stage; both characters are poised for big things in season seven.Why only four stars? With the change in focus of its main story line, season six loses much of its fast-paced nature, instead relying heavily on character relationships and dialogue without much action. Many of these scenes can be slow and leave much to be desired. Further, some of the main story arcs grow cumbersome; Eric's relationship with Ashley and Vince's stalker are two glaring examples.Despite these deficits, beautiful locations, hilarious dialogue, entertaining story lines for the shows ""other"" characters, and quality cameos make this season one not to be missed.",4,"Entourage, Season Six: A Different Direction Still Yields Quality TV",1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,2544,"['title', 'season', 'six', 'manner', 'much', 'different', 'previous', 'seasons', 'changes', 'stray', 'normal', 'theme', 'Entourage', 'results', 'still', 'provide', 'entertaining', 'well', 'written', 'television', 'season.This', 'change', 'direction', 'exists', 'benefit', 'show', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'given', 'opportunity', 'develop', 'shine', 'own', 'Ordinarily', 'Vince', 'center', 'attention', 'main', 'story', 'arc', 'centered', 'career', 'season', 'six', 'however', 'Vince', 'drama', 'limited', 'only', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'grand', 'premiere', 'Gatsby', 'Vince', 'latest', 'movie', 'viewers', 'impression', 'film', 'success', 'Apart', 'very', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'dedicated', 'Vince', 'career', 'one', 'episode', 'learn', 'start', 'date', 'filming', 'Vince', 'latest', 'movie', 'been', 'significantly', 'delayed', 'perhaps', 'not', 'so', 'subtle', 'hint', 'show', 'writers', 'attention', 'Vince', 'will', 'be', 'delayed', 'meantime', 'Eric', 'career', 'transformation', 'better', 'emerge', 'Vincent', 'Chase', 'shadow', 'story', 'line', 'enjoyable', 'Eric', 'potential', 'professional', 'talent', 'manager', 'top-notch', 'firm', 'Conversely', 'Eric', 'other', 'main', 'story', 'line', 'relationship', 'neighbor', 'Ashley', 'be', 'irritating', 'season', 'weak', 'point.Drama', 'favorite', 'character', 'similar', 'career', 'transformation', 'season', 'character', 'much', 'promise', 'next', 'season', 'Kevin', 'Dillon', 'acting', 'spot-on', 'usual', 'providing', 'hilarity', 'emotional', 'depth.Turtle', 'biggest', 'character', 'transformation', 'shedding', 'slacker', 'unmotivated', 'image', 'held', 'series', 'easily', 'Jerry', 'Ferrara', 'best', 'season', 'acting', 'wise', 'hopefully', 'will', 'continue', 'progress', 'character.Ari', 'Ari', 'usual', 'relationship', 'Lloyd', 'center', 'stage', 'characters', 'are', 'poised', 'big', 'things', 'season', 'seven.Why', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'change', 'focus', 'main', 'story', 'line', 'season', 'six', 'much', 'fast-paced', 'nature', 'instead', 'relying', 'heavily', 'character', 'relationships', 'dialogue', 'much', 'action', 'Many', 'scenes', 'can', 'be', 'slow', 'leave', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'Further', 'main', 'story', 'arcs', 'grow', 'cumbersome', 'Eric', 'relationship', 'Ashley', 'Vince', 'stalker', 'are', 'two', 'glaring', 'deficits', 'beautiful', 'locations', 'hilarious', 'dialogue', 'entertaining', 'story', 'lines', 'shows', 'other', 'characters', 'quality', 'cameos', 'make', 'season', 'one', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

1260366,A10C2SBALDLKU9,B002BWOYKC,Steven Carrier,"[2, 2]","Season Six of HBO's ""Entourage"" really rests on its laurels. This season is probably the worst of them all, next to Season One. While that might sound like harsh criticism, it's really not all that bad- it's just a step down in quality compared to Season Four and Five's sheer brilliance. Season Six is all about relationships- which is great, but too bad none of them are all that interesting. Eric's storyline with Ashley is just plain annoying, but thankfully it's redeemed with a late season turn with Sloan back in the picture. Ari is still Ari, but his story lines make him out to be just plain mean, rather than sweet with an angry side as depicted in earlier seasons. Vince, the main character, is left out to dry with a storyline about a stalker that goes absolutely nowhere... and that's about it. He has sex a lot and the scenes do push the limit. Turtle walks away with the best depicted relationship and his scenes with Jamie-Lynn Sigler are sweet and honest. Drama wines a lot and acts like a fool per usual, but where they leave his character at the end, makes it worth it. The season is saved by a relaxed pace, wit, great cinematography, plenty of star cameos and the characters are still as likable as ever. Those elements will never go away but when the cast has great story lines to work with (like in Season's Four and Five) all those ever present positives are enhanced to genius. ""Entourage"" is still, in whole, one of the best shows on TV and Season Six may be a sidestep into the boring, but the finale (like Season One's) promises better tomorrows. Season Six is pretty lazy to tell you truth, but if you are a fan of the show, it's certainly still worth watching. I doubt this will win over any converts.This Season Six set includes the episodes:- Drive- Amongst Friends- One Car, Two Car, Red Car, Blue Car- Running on E- Fore!- Murphy's Lie- No More Drama- The Sorkin Notes- Security Briefs- Berried Alive- Scared Straight- Give a Little Bit",3,A lazy season at best,1278028800,"07 2, 2010",2010,1970,"['Season', 'Six', 'HBO', 'Entourage', 'really', 'laurels', 'season', 'probably', 'worst', 'next', 'Season', 'One', 'might', 'sound', 'harsh', 'criticism', 'really', 'not', 'bad-', 'just', 'step', 'down', 'quality', 'compared', 'Season', 'Four', 'Five', 'sheer', 'brilliance', 'Season', 'Six', 'relationships-', 'great', 'too', 'bad', 'none', 'are', 'interesting', 'Eric', 'storyline', 'Ashley', 'just', 'plain', 'annoying', 'thankfully', 'redeemed', 'late', 'season', 'turn', 'Sloan', 'back', 'picture', 'Ari', 'still', 'Ari', 'story', 'lines', 'make', 'be', 'just', 'plain', 'mean', 'rather', 'sweet', 'angry', 'side', 'depicted', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Vince', 'main', 'character', 'left', 'out', 'dry', 'storyline', 'stalker', 'absolutely', 'nowhere', 'sex', 'lot', 'scenes', 'do', 'push', 'limit', 'Turtle', 'away', 'best', 'depicted', 'relationship', 'scenes', 'Jamie-Lynn', 'Sigler', 'are', 'sweet', 'honest', 'Drama', 'lot', 'acts', 'fool', 'usual', 'where', 'leave', 'character', 'end', 'season', 'saved', 'relaxed', 'pace', 'wit', 'great', 'cinematography', 'plenty', 'star', 'cameos', 'characters', 'are', 'still', 'as', 'likable', 'ever', 'elements', 'will', 'never', 'go', 'away', 'when', 'cast', 'great', 'story', 'lines', 'work', 'Season', 'Four', 'Five', 'ever', 'present', 'positives', 'are', 'enhanced', 'genius', 'Entourage', 'still', 'whole', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'TV', 'Season', 'Six', 'may', 'be', 'sidestep', 'boring', 'finale', 'Season', 'One', 'better', 'tomorrows', 'Season', 'Six', 'pretty', 'lazy', 'tell', 'truth', 'are', 'fan', 'show', 'certainly', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'doubt', 'will', 'win', 'converts.This', 'Season', 'Six', 'set', 'episodes', 'Drive-', 'Amongst', 'Friends-', 'One', 'Car', 'Two', 'Car', 'Red', 'Car', 'Blue', 'Car-', 'Running', 'E-', 'Fore', 'Murphy', 'Lie-', 'No', 'More', 'Drama-', 'Sorkin', 'Notes-', 'Security', 'Briefs-', 'Berried', 'Alive-', 'Scared', 'Straight-', 'Give', 'Little', 'Bit']",N/A
