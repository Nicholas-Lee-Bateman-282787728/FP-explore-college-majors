It had its funny moments, but it was no great show.This one is just bad. There's really no intended purpose to any of this. It's simply a mashing of incoherent and obscurely done live-action sketches without any jokes, and with attempts at humor which fail miserably. It just seems to be Tim and Eric's attempts to broadcast their obsession with weird noises and things to other people, like the way they like to make noises with their mouths, and dress up and talk like other people (it would be called acting if they were any good at it).I just can't believe how awful it is... it's not even like bad like Tom Goes to the Mayor was, this has nothing in it.

1129590,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B00113YHXG,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[24, 73]","What can one say about a TV show whose main objective is to be as deliberately awful as possible, and that somehow is supposed to be brilliant comedy?  I was astonished at how truly awful this stuff is.  The only time I laughed out loud was when John C. Reilly showed up as Dr. Bruse.  Reilly is a very good actor, and it was the only time during the show that I actually laughed heartily.  If I was John's agent, I would recommend to him not to do this show anymore, as it belittles him as an actor and artist.  Fred Willard also shows up, and while I love Mr. Willard's work, he can't rescue the scene he's in, which is pretty lame.  The series isn't completely devoid of laughs, but aside from John Reilly's work, I laughed maybe 3 times during the whole season.  The series is more creepy than funny.It's a pretty poor indication of a show's quality when the episodes are a mere 11 minutes long, and I kept checking the DVD to see when it was going to be over.  The eleven minutes seem longer than Gone With the Wind at times.  The targets of the satire seem to be local cable commercials, which are actually funnier than most of the stuff here.  The ""gravy robbers"" is one of the dumbest (not ""funny dumb"") sketches I ever saw.  The ""editing"", if one can call it that, is not done with any rhyme or reason, even in an artistic sense.  It's all just random, and it isn't funny or interesting.This is not brilliant comedy, as some say here.  I'm getting really tired of people simply thinking since this show (and others of its ilk) polarise people, that automatically makes its art.  Some nimrod on IMDB actually compared this show to Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, in terms that when The Rite of Spring first appeared, the audience was shocked at the performance of it, and it split the audience.  The Rite of Spring is considering a masterpiece by most in classical musical circles, because of its use of twelve tone music and atonal shadings, which were unfamilar to audiences when the work premiered.  Tim and Eric is not on that level, nowhere close to it, and it's a deep insult to anyone who is familar with Stravinsky to actually compare the two.  A couple of rules of life...1.  Just because something is controversial doesn't make it brilliant.2.  Just because something isn't mainstream doesn't mean it's good.3.  Just because something like this is weird doesn't make it good.4.  Just because someone doesn't like this doesn't mean they watch  Friends or Two and a Half Men.5.  Just because something polarises people doesn't make it art.Some have said it's deliberately surreal, but it isn't.  It's just lazy and incoherent.  It has some similar qualities to MTV2's Wonder Showzen, except Wonder Showzen had some real creative transistions in the first season (the 2nd season wasn't as good...the drugs they took must have worn off).  I think many who think this show is some sort of misunderstood artistic masterpiece are just reading way too much into it, and it's the product of their own imaginations rather than any brilliance on the part of Tim and Eric.I only managed to watch 9 episodes of this.  The 9th episode was so awful I literally could not watch the 10th one.  I felt disgusted by the mediocrity of it all.  Never before in my life have I sealed a Netflix envelope so quickly.

The only good thing about it is Dr. Steve Brule, and now he has his own show, so we can all forget this garbage! Right? I mean Dr. Steve is the only thing I can think of as to why the ratings for this show get past 2 (Tim & Eric themselves)! What makes me really mad is that trash like this can go on for years, but truly great shows like Mission HillMission Hill - The Complete Series& The Dana Carvey ShowThe Dana Carvey Show(just to name a few) barely make it out of the gate! Hell even 12oz Mouse was better than this and it looked like a retarded kangaroo made it! I don't know anyone who likes this show and I hope I never do, because I will have to fight them to the death!!!! This show is not worth the film it was recorded on, and Tim & Eric should have no access to film equipment or recording devices of any kind! If they had to go audio, the album would be stupid noises of constipation and farts with their mouths, or high pitched squealing directly into the mic with mass feedback! Don't comics get booed off the stage for crap like this? Tom Goes to the Mayor was (almost) just as bad, however it had enough other star power to make me laugh once or twice (at the guest star, not T&E;) that it almost balanced it out... Almost! these guys are not funny! They are GROSS! No one needs or should want to see the kind of sick images they come up with! If I met Tim and/or Eric I would run, not because of this review, but because I would be afraid they would sweat of drool on me! They look as if they would be very unclean and and disease carrying... NO THANKS!!!And one more thing, it's not even a cartoon, at least Tom goes to the Mayor was un-animated stills!!! It's Cartoon Network!!! Remember? I can see it now, in five years there will be no cartoons on Cartoon Network, just like there is no music on M(usic)TV! It's not just the [Adult Swim] time slot ether! They play live action movies in the early evening too, and I think I even saw an ad for a live action show in the afternoon! There is no shortage of cartoons out there, so there is no excuse for live action on a network that used to be exclusively animated! I know I've been watching CN for a long time back when it was all ThundercatsThundercats: The Complete Seasons 1 and 2FlintstonesThe Flintstones: The Complete Series, and Scooby dooScooby-Doo, Where Are You!: The Complete First and Second Seasonsall day. I even remember before [Adult Swim] it was the ""Midnight Run"" They played DragonballDragon Ball: Season One& Gandam WingMobile Suit Gundam Wing - Complete Collection 1EDIT: Just as I feared there are now several more live action shows on [Adult Swim]: Look Around You, which was a British show poking fun at old educational series. The original British Office, with Ricky Gervais. Children's Hospital, which feels like a wanna be Scrubs (I think it's even the same hospital entrance used in Scrubs), with a bit more risque elements. Eagleheart which I haven't had a chance to see, but looks like a modern western comedy type thing. And NTSF:SD:SUV, which I also have not seen, but looks like a send-up of all the thousands of crime scene/police investigation shows that exist today. That's now a total of 6 live action shows on a network that used to be dedicated to cartoons only. I can only imagine what the daytime Cartoon Network lineup is like now days.

The acting and writing are both god-awful, and I was wondering why this show kept getting renewed for more seasons and why people kept saying it was awesome.Then I realized why. It's just one big, stupid joke. Tim and Eric make their show as awful as possible, and people praise their &#34;genius&#34; because they think they're somehow smart for &#34;understanding&#34; Tim and Eric's antics... it's like the 'Emperor's New Clothes' and most people don't want to admit that the Emperor is naked.
