7161,A2Z5RFU4DH3T0G,0767802802,"A. Fondacaro ""NiaTonyF""","[9, 10]","The film would have fallen flat on its face were it not for a command performance from Hopkins.  This is not to say that Thompson, James Fox, Hugh Grant, et al aren't fantastic as well; they light up the screen.  Michael Lonsdale also has a smart little part as the French delegate Dupont D'Ivry.The film is more or less about the ""repressed"" Stevens (Hopkins), the proper-ist of proper English butlers, reminiscing about the prime of his career serving Nazi-sympathizing Lord Darlington (James Fox) during the years surrounding World War II.  This being said, there are slightly political moments that color some of his memories, but they are not the focus, nor do they detract.One day in the manor, a young housekeeper shows up called Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson).  She has excellent references, plenty of experience, try not to fall in love with one of the staff-men, when can you start?  The problem becomes Stevens; he begins to fall in love with her.Here is where the film begins to take liberties with the book, but the sublimity with which it's accomplished is truly remarkable.  Here is a film adaptation achieving the same kind of moods and complexity as the book.  With Stevens falling in love with Kenton, and vice-versa, the two are bound by their facade of service to remain absolutely mum about the whole thing, even in the quiet moments they have outside the world of their duties.  The audience begins to realize that they've become so caught up with their jobs that it's begun to master their identity, to the point where their desire for one another takes a back seat to the wish to not break any of the house rules.If the book is about the nature of reminiscing and the consciousness of a narrator; the film is about the desire for self-satisfaction versus the need for self-transcendence.  By giving in to the love Stevens and Kenton feel for one another, they would be rising above their lonely identities so closely wrapped up with Darlington Hall.  By fighting the desire for one another, they satisfy the professional and personal sense of achievement, and the hollow sort of transcendence it provides.Too many reviewers boiled it down to, ""It's a movie about doing what you really want to do,"" or ""it's a ""follow-your-heart"" tale.""  Few see it in terms of Stevens not ever being able to give in to his love for Miss Kenton.  Such is the nature of his personality and experience, that the choice of giving in has been, no pun intended, given up.  Basically: could Stevens choose between the house and housekeeper?  No, the house wins everytime.Hopkins needed to win an Oscar for this, instead Tom Hanks won in 93 for his work in Philadelphia.  Far be it from me to sunder the work of Mr. Hanks, but Sir Hopkins put on one of the finest acting performances I think anyone has put to celluloid, and the Academy passed it up.  File this under more evidence for the fact that the Academy loves to make political statements with its decision on who to give Oscars, and its preference for American actors.",5,"Adapted from Ishiguro, brilliantly played-",1094256000,"09 4, 2004",2004,3023,"['film', 'would', 'have', 'fallen', 'flat', 'face', 'were', 'not', 'command', 'performance', 'Hopkins', 'not', 'say', 'Thompson', 'James', 'Fox', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'et', 'al', 'are', ""n't"", 'fantastic', 'as', 'well', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'Michael', 'Lonsdale', 'also', 'smart', 'little', 'part', 'French', 'delegate', 'Dupont', ""D'Ivry.The"", 'film', 'more', 'less', 'repressed', 'Stevens', 'Hopkins', 'proper-ist', 'proper', 'English', 'butlers', 'reminiscing', 'prime', 'career', 'serving', 'Nazi-sympathizing', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'James', 'Fox', 'years', 'surrounding', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'being', 'said', 'are', 'slightly', 'political', 'moments', 'color', 'memories', 'are', 'not', 'focus', 'do', 'detract.One', 'day', 'manor', 'young', 'housekeeper', 'up', 'called', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'excellent', 'references', 'plenty', 'experience', 'try', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'one', 'staff-men', 'when', 'can', 'start', 'problem', 'Stevens', 'fall', 'love', 'her.Here', 'where', 'film', 'take', 'liberties', 'book', 'sublimity', 'accomplished', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'Here', 'film', 'adaptation', 'achieving', 'same', 'kind', 'moods', 'complexity', 'book', 'Stevens', 'falling', 'love', 'Kenton', 'vice-versa', 'two', 'are', 'bound', 'facade', 'service', 'remain', 'absolutely', 'mum', 'whole', 'thing', 'even', 'quiet', 'moments', 'have', 'world', 'duties', 'audience', 'realize', ""'ve"", 'become', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'jobs', 'begun', 'master', 'identity', 'point', 'where', 'desire', 'one', 'back', 'seat', 'wish', 'not', 'break', 'house', 'rules.If', 'book', 'nature', 'reminiscing', 'consciousness', 'narrator', 'film', 'desire', 'self-satisfaction', 'need', 'self-transcendence', 'giving', 'love', 'Stevens', 'Kenton', 'feel', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'rising', 'lonely', 'identities', 'so', 'closely', 'wrapped', 'up', 'Darlington', 'Hall', 'fighting', 'desire', 'one', 'satisfy', 'professional', 'personal', 'sense', 'achievement', 'hollow', 'sort', 'transcendence', 'provides.Too', 'many', 'reviewers', 'boiled', 'down', 'movie', 'doing', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'do', 'follow-your-heart', 'tale', 'Few', 'see', 'terms', 'Stevens', 'not', 'ever', 'being', 'able', 'give', 'love', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'Such', 'nature', 'personality', 'experience', 'choice', 'giving', 'been', 'pun', 'intended', 'given', 'up', 'Basically', 'could', 'Stevens', 'choose', 'house', 'housekeeper', 'No', 'house', 'needed', 'win', 'Oscar', 'instead', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'won', '93', 'work', 'Philadelphia', 'Far', 'be', 'sunder', 'work', 'Mr.', 'Hanks', 'Sir', 'Hopkins', 'put', 'one', 'finest', 'acting', 'performances', 'think', 'anyone', 'put', 'celluloid', 'Academy', 'passed', 'up', 'more', 'evidence', 'fact', 'Academy', 'make', 'political', 'statements', 'decision', 'who', 'give', 'Oscars', 'preference', 'American', 'actors']",N/A

7164,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0767802802,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","You can pretty much copy and paste my review for `Howards End' here and call it a day since my feelings for both films is pretty much identical.  Both films possess this air of elegance that just engulfs every scene and creates this strength and profound character.  I may prefer this film `slightly' but really, both films are just utterly brilliant, and effortlessly so.  I think that is what is so spellbinding about these two movies, they are effortless.  There is no sign of overreaching or forced gracefulness.  Every single frame floats by with a restrained tension that just uplifts the entire film and delivers a beautiful piece of art to our eyes and ears, and most importantly, our hearts.Consider this film perfection.The story told here is of a butler and housekeeper in England as World War II is looming over the shoulders of everyone around.  The film is basically a brooding study of human loyalties and the longing for a feeling of accomplishment.  Stevens, the butler, is a man filled with repressed emotions because of his determination to do his job perfectly.  He restricts himself, making many sacrifices in order to hold onto the feeling of control and pride.  It's not a selfish or a detrimental pride (at least not detrimental in the usual sense) but a pride that comes from being able to say you have done something to the best of your ability.  His relationship with the headstrong and rather liberal Miss Kenton tests his viewpoint and his methods.Draped in luscious scenery and woven tightly into a profound and provocative storyline, `The Remains of the Day' will remain in your soul.It lingers.The film is propelled marvelously by the two leads, Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson.  Hopkins in particular is just brilliant here, showcasing his characters inner emotional frustration as he makes himself the proper representation of loyal service.  It's a gargantuan on a performance, a pure tour-de-force that had no business losing the Oscar to Tom Hanks' hammy gimmick in `Philadelphia'.  In fact, if it wasn't for Russell Crowe delivering one of the most fearlessly committed performances I've ever seen in `Romper Stomper', I'd give Hopkins my personal award for this.  Thompson matches him with so much heart, warmth and spirit.  I struggle with category placement with her (she totally supports him, but she needs no support herself) but either way, she is sublime.They really NEED to do another movie together!If you haven't had the pleasure of seeing this (or the splendid `Howards End') I highly, HIGHLY recommend you seek them out this instant.  They are beautiful films that match their internal composition with richly organic performances and sumptuous scenery that just begs to be seen and worshiped.These are better than modern masterpieces, they are modern miracles!",5,This remains one of my favorite films of all time...,1259712000,"12 2, 2009",2009,2813,"['can', 'pretty', 'much', 'copy', 'paste', 'review', 'Howards', 'End', 'here', 'call', 'day', 'feelings', 'films', 'pretty', 'much', 'identical', 'films', 'possess', 'air', 'elegance', 'just', 'engulfs', 'scene', 'strength', 'profound', 'character', 'may', 'prefer', 'film', 'slightly', 'really', 'films', 'are', 'just', 'utterly', 'brilliant', 'effortlessly', 'so', 'think', 'what', 'so', 'spellbinding', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'effortless', 'sign', 'overreaching', 'forced', 'gracefulness', 'single', 'frame', 'floats', 'restrained', 'tension', 'just', 'uplifts', 'entire', 'film', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'art', 'eyes', 'ears', 'most', 'importantly', 'hearts.Consider', 'film', 'perfection.The', 'story', 'told', 'here', 'butler', 'housekeeper', 'England', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'looming', 'shoulders', 'everyone', 'around', 'film', 'basically', 'brooding', 'study', 'human', 'loyalties', 'longing', 'feeling', 'accomplishment', 'Stevens', 'butler', 'man', 'filled', 'repressed', 'emotions', 'determination', 'do', 'job', 'perfectly', 'making', 'many', 'sacrifices', 'order', 'hold', 'feeling', 'control', 'pride', 'not', 'selfish', 'detrimental', 'pride', 'least', 'not', 'detrimental', 'usual', 'sense', 'pride', 'being', 'able', 'say', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'best', 'ability', 'relationship', 'headstrong', 'rather', 'liberal', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'viewpoint', 'methods.Draped', 'luscious', 'scenery', 'woven', 'tightly', 'profound', 'provocative', 'storyline', 'Remains', 'Day', 'will', 'remain', 'soul.It', 'lingers.The', 'film', 'propelled', 'marvelously', 'two', 'leads', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Hopkins', 'particular', 'just', 'brilliant', 'here', 'showcasing', 'characters', 'inner', 'emotional', 'frustration', 'proper', 'representation', 'loyal', 'service', 'gargantuan', 'performance', 'pure', 'tour-de-force', 'had', 'business', 'losing', 'Oscar', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'hammy', 'gimmick', 'Philadelphia', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'delivering', 'one', 'most', 'fearlessly', 'committed', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Romper', 'Stomper', ""'d"", 'give', 'Hopkins', 'personal', 'award', 'Thompson', 'so', 'much', 'heart', 'warmth', 'spirit', 'struggle', 'category', 'placement', 'totally', 'support', 'way', 'sublime.They', 'really', 'NEED', 'do', 'movie', 'together', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'splendid', 'Howards', 'End', 'highly', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'seek', 'out', 'instant', 'are', 'beautiful', 'films', 'match', 'internal', 'composition', 'richly', 'organic', 'performances', 'sumptuous', 'scenery', 'just', 'begs', 'be', 'seen', 'worshiped.These', 'are', 'better', 'modern', 'masterpieces', 'are', 'modern', 'miracles']",N/A

Hopkins performance is among his best ever. I wish all men behaved with traditional English manners like his character does, the world would be a better place. As wonderful as it is it's also a little odd, leaves you trying to figure out what's really going on. But you can't take your eyes off it. There's an odd little scene where Hopkins character visits a small English pub after running out of gas. This little pub is SO stereotypical. A crowded little place, active with locals, acting like they know you better than they do, people being very socially forward with one another, and the little back room where locals throw darts and loudly complain about politics and the way the country is run. All the things you expect of an English pub. There are some very sad moments in the film that make you think of your own regrets and mistakes in life, things you wish you had done differently.

7166,AKH9SCCIYSSGJ,0767802802,anna-joelle,"[63, 96]","I've only recently read the novel by Kazuo Ishiguro and love it so much that I quickly got hold of the video. However, in my personal opinion, the movie didn't quite do full justice to the brilliant novel it's based on.Of course, with Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson at the helm of &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot;, we can be assured that the acting is nothing short of par-excellence. So far, I've not come across any unfavourable reviews of the movie, so it does feel strange to think that I may be the only viewer who's NOT gushing over how great the film is.The story is set in 1930s and 1950s England and focuses on the life of a traditional English butler, Mr Stevens, who serves the great house of Darlington Hall and of his unwavering loyalty to his employers and of his relationship with the housekeeper, Miss Kenton. One day in the 1950s (which is &quot;present-day&quot;), he finally decides to take a short vacation by borrowing his employer's motorcar for some sight-seeing of the country and to convince Miss Kenton (who has since married and is now Mrs Benn) to come back to work for Darlington Hall. During the journey, Mr Stevens reminisces about the good ol' days back in the '30s when he is serving Lord Darlington, a distinguished English gentleman whose good intentions with regard to post-WWII Germany backfires when he is later branded as a &quot;Nazi sympathizer&quot;.While reading the novel, I did wonder how well the story will transfer on film, because the novel focuses a lot on Stevens' thoughts and feelings which he doesn't show outwardly and so couldn't be projected on film, no matter how good the actor is. In the movie, there is also no voice-over to convey his actual thoughts and emotions. So what we get is Anthony Hopkins' butler who displays a very limited range of emotions throughout the movie - 1) Thoughtful (although we can't tell what he's actually thinking about), 2) Courteous (to his employers and the guests), 3) Curt (to Miss Kenton) and 4) Cold (90% of the time) - without a clear explanation. If you've not read the novel, I doubt you'll fully understand the nature of Stevens' character and the reasons for his apparent &quot;coldness&quot; and strange behaviour e.g. NOT bothering to console Miss Kenton when she is crying so desperately right in front of him, and why he decides to lie (to the people he meets during his car journey) about not being acquainted with Lord Darlington.My second complaint is this: in the novel, Stevens' &quot;present-day&quot; employer is a Mr Farraday, a nice American gentleman. But in the movie, the employer has been changed to &quot;Mr Lewis&quot; (played by Christopher Reeves). The problem is that the same &quot;Mr Lewis&quot; also happens to be the &quot;villain&quot; (in both novel and movie) who in the '30s tries to sabotage Lord Darlington's efforts to reconcile Germany with the rest of Europe after WWII. It is difficult to believe that Stevens (who so dislikes Mr Lewis) could end up serving him LATER on after Lord Darlington passes away.But the most dissapointing part of the film is the omission of what I deem the most important scene in the book: when towards the end, Stevens and Miss Kenton meet up again after over 20 long years and Miss Kenton confesses that the reason she is unhappy with her marriage is because she often wonders what kind of a life she might have had with him (Mr Stevens). And in the book, Stevens' heart is breaking when he hears that. It's a most moving scene - practically a declaration of love between the two, for goodness sake, and yet this scene is omitted in the movie.Watch the movie if you can. But do read the novel which is one of the most brilliant writings to come out of the 20th century. The words used are simply beautiful, eloquent and breathtaking. The book is most remarkable, but I really can't say the same for the movie.",3,Didn't Quite Live Up to My Expectation....,994032000,"07 2, 2001",2001,3882,"[""'ve"", 'only', 'recently', 'read', 'novel', 'Kazuo', 'Ishiguro', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'quickly', 'got', 'hold', 'video', 'However', 'personal', 'opinion', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'do', 'full', 'justice', 'brilliant', 'based', 'on.Of', 'course', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'helm', 'quot', 'Remains', 'Day', 'quot', 'can', 'be', 'assured', 'acting', 'nothing', 'short', 'par-excellence', 'So', 'far', ""'ve"", 'not', 'come', 'unfavourable', 'reviews', 'movie', 'feel', 'strange', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'viewer', 'who', 'NOT', 'gushing', 'how', 'great', 'film', 'is.The', 'story', 'set', '1930s', '1950s', 'England', 'focuses', 'life', 'traditional', 'English', 'butler', 'Mr', 'Stevens', 'who', 'great', 'house', 'Darlington', 'Hall', 'unwavering', 'loyalty', 'employers', 'relationship', 'housekeeper', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'One', 'day', '1950s', 'quot', 'present-day', 'quot', 'finally', 'take', 'short', 'vacation', 'borrowing', 'employer', 'motorcar', 'sight-seeing', 'country', 'convince', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'who', 'married', 'now', 'Mrs', 'Benn', 'come', 'back', 'work', 'Darlington', 'Hall', 'journey', 'Mr', 'Stevens', 'good', 'ol', 'days', 'back', ""'30s"", 'when', 'serving', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'distinguished', 'English', 'gentleman', 'good', 'intentions', 'regard', 'post-WWII', 'Germany', 'backfires', 'when', 'later', 'branded', 'quot', 'Nazi', 'sympathizer', 'quot', 'reading', 'novel', 'did', 'wonder', 'how', 'well', 'story', 'will', 'transfer', 'film', 'novel', 'lot', 'Stevens', 'thoughts', 'feelings', ""n't"", 'show', 'outwardly', 'so', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'projected', 'film', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'actor', 'movie', 'also', 'voice-over', 'convey', 'actual', 'thoughts', 'emotions', 'So', 'what', 'get', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'butler', 'who', 'very', 'limited', 'range', 'emotions', 'movie', '1', 'Thoughtful', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'actually', 'thinking', '2', 'Courteous', 'employers', 'guests', '3', 'Curt', 'Miss', 'Kenton', '4', 'Cold', '90', '%', 'time', 'clear', 'explanation', ""'ve"", 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'fully', 'understand', 'nature', 'Stevens', 'character', 'reasons', 'apparent', 'quot', 'coldness', 'quot', 'strange', 'behaviour', 'e.g', 'NOT', 'bothering', 'console', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'when', 'crying', 'so', 'desperately', 'right', 'front', 'why', 'lie', 'people', 'car', 'journey', 'not', 'being', 'acquainted', 'Lord', 'Darlington.My', 'second', 'complaint', 'novel', 'Stevens', 'quot', 'present-day', 'quot', 'employer', 'Mr', 'Farraday', 'nice', 'American', 'gentleman', 'movie', 'employer', 'been', 'changed', 'quot', 'Mr', 'Lewis', 'quot', 'played', 'Christopher', 'Reeves', 'problem', 'same', 'quot', 'Mr', 'Lewis', 'quot', 'also', 'be', 'quot', 'villain', 'quot', 'novel', 'movie', 'who', ""'30s"", 'tries', 'sabotage', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'efforts', 'reconcile', 'Germany', 'rest', 'Europe', 'WWII', 'difficult', 'believe', 'Stevens', 'who', 'so', 'dislikes', 'Mr', 'Lewis', 'could', 'end', 'up', 'serving', 'LATER', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'away.But', 'most', 'dissapointing', 'part', 'film', 'omission', 'what', 'deem', 'most', 'important', 'scene', 'book', 'when', 'end', 'Stevens', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'up', 'again', '20', 'long', 'years', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'reason', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'often', 'what', 'kind', 'life', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'Mr', 'Stevens', 'book', 'Stevens', 'heart', 'breaking', 'when', 'most', 'moving', 'scene', 'practically', 'declaration', 'love', 'two', 'goodness', 'sake', 'yet', 'scene', 'omitted', 'movie.Watch', 'movie', 'can', 'do', 'read', 'novel', 'one', 'most', 'brilliant', 'writings', 'come', '20th', 'century', 'words', 'used', 'are', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'eloquent', 'breathtaking', 'book', 'most', 'remarkable', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'same', 'movie']",N/A

The other group (myself including) find it delightful and powerful, in a very special understated way.Portraying a relationship of two people who sacrificed their lives to serving their lords, the basic story is enhanced by wonderful performances of Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson. These two splendid actors met once again under the direction of James Ivory after starring in the previous Merchant-Ivory production gem ""Howards End"".The story takes place some years after the war, when the perfect butler from pre-war era, Mr. Stevens (Hopkins), drives the car to visit the Darlington Hall's former housekeeper Miss Kenton (Thompson). The film's substantial part takes place in this past, with the end section describing the reunion of the two, whose time for love, sadly, is long past. Yet Stevens embarks on this journey, a little too late for making up for what he missed, when he was such a great, dependable servant to Lord Darlington.Darlington is a character cleverly thought up by the original novel author Kazuo Ishiguro, in that he is an example of a politician going completely in a wrong direction -- the history and the present have plenty of suchlike ones. The film's main storyline is thus set in ominous undertones of pending World War II.Surging, restless score by Richard Robbins (not very good for listening on its own, without viewing) and beautiful cinematography help make the film what it is, a stunning work of art, but two main stars steal the show. You could say sometimes there is a lack of expression on the face of Stevens whatsoever and still it's a great acting. He just loses his temper once -- but Miss Kenton is not there to see it anymore. For that matter, Thompson's acting is, as always, equally superb -- her eyes and face speak volumes without words.Indeed, there is a lot of going on for a careful observer to see and digest in his/her mind while viewing this film. Subtly beautiful and ultimately quite sad, it leaves you with questioning your own priorities in life.If you haven't seen ""The Remains of the Day"" yet and love films set in England (""Sense and Sensibility"", ""Gosford Park"", ""Howards End""), give yourself a treat a see it.",5,"""The Remains of the Day"" Remains One of Best Films Ever",1046304000,"02 27, 2003",2003,2440,"['creating', 'elite', 'best-understood', 'sense', 'word', 'Remains', 'Day', 'film', 'viewers', 'two', 'categories', 'one', 'who', 'are', 'left', 'indifferent', 'who', 'miss', 'full-swing', 'action', 'find', 'film', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'boring', 'other', 'group', 'including', 'find', 'delightful', 'powerful', 'very', 'special', 'understated', 'way.Portraying', 'relationship', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'sacrificed', 'lives', 'serving', 'lords', 'basic', 'story', 'enhanced', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'two', 'splendid', 'actors', 'met', 'once', 'again', 'direction', 'James', 'Ivory', 'starring', 'previous', 'Merchant-Ivory', 'production', 'gem', 'Howards', 'End', '.The', 'story', 'place', 'years', 'war', 'when', 'perfect', 'butler', 'pre-war', 'era', 'Mr.', 'Stevens', 'Hopkins', 'car', 'visit', 'Darlington', 'Hall', 'former', 'housekeeper', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'Thompson', 'film', 'substantial', 'part', 'place', 'past', 'end', 'section', 'describing', 'reunion', 'two', 'time', 'love', 'sadly', 'long', 'past', 'Stevens', 'journey', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'making', 'up', 'what', 'missed', 'when', 'was', 'such', 'great', 'dependable', 'servant', 'Lord', 'Darlington.Darlington', 'character', 'cleverly', 'thought', 'up', 'original', 'novel', 'author', 'Kazuo', 'Ishiguro', 'example', 'politician', 'going', 'completely', 'wrong', 'direction', 'history', 'present', 'have', 'plenty', 'suchlike', 'ones', 'film', 'main', 'storyline', 'thus', 'set', 'ominous', 'undertones', 'pending', 'World', 'War', 'II.Surging', 'restless', 'score', 'Richard', 'Robbins', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'listening', 'own', 'viewing', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'help', 'make', 'film', 'what', 'stunning', 'work', 'art', 'two', 'main', 'stars', 'steal', 'show', 'could', 'say', 'sometimes', 'lack', 'expression', 'face', 'Stevens', 'whatsoever', 'still', 'great', 'acting', 'just', 'temper', 'once', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'not', 'there', 'see', 'anymore', 'matter', 'Thompson', 'acting', 'always', 'equally', 'superb', 'eyes', 'face', 'speak', 'volumes', 'words.Indeed', 'lot', 'going', 'careful', 'observer', 'see', 'digest', 'his/her', 'mind', 'viewing', 'film', 'Subtly', 'beautiful', 'ultimately', 'quite', 'sad', 'questioning', 'own', 'priorities', 'life.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Remains', 'Day', 'yet', 'love', 'films', 'set', 'England', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'Howards', 'End', 'give', 'treat', 'see']",N/A
7169,A6JJ7CD3RN1W5,0767802802,a writer,"[3, 3]","""Remains of the Day"" is a classic film from the Merchant-Ivory team that lifted the English drama genre out of BBC and PBS obscurity. It works seemlessly and beautifully between past and present, and shows the depth of human emotion behind upper-crust gentility.Anthony Hopkins is superb as Stevens, the head butler to an English lord whose naive sympathy for the Nazis lead to his downfall. Emma Thompson plays the head housekeeper who joins the manor staff and tries to shake Hopkins out of his emotional and political complacency. The attraction between the two grows out of the tension between doing one's duty and honoring one's feelings. As Thompson's character grows more restless, Hopkins' grows ever more resistant to her overtures. One excellent scene, where she invades his dark study, shows how the butler's training and detachment struggle against a growing affection: as Thompson tries to pry a book from Hopkins' fingers, you can hear the clench he maintains until the end.The film covers a lot of themes at once: loyalty, sacrifice, unrequited love, and regret. When Hopkins travels to search out Thompson nearly twenty years after WWII, it's as much for the chance at reviving love as it is for asking her to return to the manor. The end scenes are heart-rending without being maudlin.The other characters are also well done: James Fox as Lord Darlington, the old-fashioned aristocrat who plays the unwitting dupe for Nazi envoys in pre-Churchill Britain; Christopher Reeve as the realistic American politician who voices fear and dismay at the events in the manor (and becomes owner after the war); Peter Vaughan as Stevens' elderly father, and Hugh Grant as Darlington's nephew.Location shots are sumptuous, from the grand interiors of Darlington Hall to the English countryside.

7176,AQP8SX7ZRLQM3,0767802802,"Bryan Huffstutler ""contethra""","[54, 68]","Remains of the Day is probably my favorite film of all time.  We favor movies that we can identify with.  I think author Kazuo Ishiguro's comment was dead on when he said ""I think we all can identify with Stevens in one way or another"".  However, this is not a review of the film.  Enough has been said about that.  This is, instead, a technical review of the long awaited distribution of the film in DVD format.My expectation was that when I was able to view the film on DVD in its original wide screen format, all that extra screen space that normally gets cut away to modify the picture for television would be viewable again.  I was mistaken.  I popped my VHS tape in the VCR and my new DVD in its player and set the TV to show both VHS and DVD side by side (I'd been wanting to do this for years).  What I saw surprised me.  The VHS version does indeed remove some of the picture from the sides.  What I didn't expect is that it has additional picture on the top and bottom that the wide screen release on DVD does NOT.  The important issue here is that the additional picture provided in the wide screen film provides LESS usable information toward the visual translation of the film than the 4:3 aspect for VHS/TV which provides more real estate top and bottom. Case and point:Probably the most important scene in the film is ""The Book"".  Miss Kenton corners Mr. Stephens in his office and pries a book from his hands.  This is the most intimate moment for the couple.  In the VHS version the struggle with the book in picture can clearly be watched.  In the DVD version the bottom of the frame impedes this subject matter; the book and her hands struggling with his.  There are many other scenes where either props or architecture in the top and bottom of the frame better serve the nuance of the scene than what can be seen on either side of the frame.  Specifically, desktops.  There are many scenes were the actor is sitting behind or near a desk or table with many informative objects on it.  The DVD version masks much of this information in most scenes, while the VHS version provides that extra bit at the bottom to show you what's on that desk, the cup of cocoa Miss Kenton is holding or the array of paperwork strewn on Lord Darlington's bed. In the final scene the painting, purchased at the beginning of the film, is hung in Mr. Lewis's new home.  He says, ""Watch the chandelier!"" to the movers.  In the VHS version you catch a glimpse of the chandelier.  In the DVD version it goes unseen.Sadly, the DVD release doesn't provide a choice of wide screen 2.35:1 or TV 4:3 in its menu options.  You get wide screen and that's it.  What you will get on DVD is better picture definition, better color, and some pretty good documentary featurettes.  Emma Thompson, James Ivory, and producer Ishmail Merchant also dub over the film for interesting optional commentary.So, for a more complete story visually, watch Remains of the Day on VHS tape.

7177,A1JCWK43MAGZIG,0767802802,"By Definition ""By Definition""","[0, 0]","With each passing year, my appreciation for Anthony Hopkins grows and grows, and Remains of the Day is one of his finest performances ever. Paired with the simply wonderful Emma Thompson in this era-spanning classic, the film succeeds grandly on many levels. Above all, perhaps, Remains is an examination of the great divide between the master class and the servant class in British society, this in the context of the affairs of state of prewar and postwar England, being conducted on the private &quot;amateur&quot; level.If you don't care for costume dramas, this film may not be for you, but I found it fascinating, even if it's flashbacks are a bit confusing at first.Whatever role he plays, whether it be billionaire or CEO or butler, Hopkins' roles always place him in some plum obsessive/compulsive spot in the social order, and as a butler he is blind to all but the allegiances to which he is expected to conform. Remains of the Day explores these blind spots deliciously, the ignorance of the outside world Stevens imposes on himself out of duty. Richard Robbins Glass-esque score was fresh and hypnotic, transporting us into the lush greenery and richly cloistered environment of the old house.The relationship between Hopkins as Stevens and his Butler-father also struck a very rich chord with me.

7180,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,0767802802,C. B Collins Jr.,"[2, 2]","The beauty of Remains of the Day can not be overstated. The photography and art direction were superb in every way. The camera is usually at eye level in most shots, giving the film some intimacy within a great beautiful country home.The film is based on the novel by Kazuo Ishiguro, a talented master of the understated and unsaid. Anthony Hopkins plays his best role in this film because so much of the acting depends on what is controlled and not said, yet conveyed through subtle movements of the eye or shoulders or head. Hopkins plays Mr. Stevens, the head butler of a large wealthy country estate in rural England. He is the model of organization and forethought. Yet in this job he is so focused on this duty that he ignores the forces around him that call him into participation in the human experience. Notice Mr. Steven's reactions when he hears of the death of his father. Notice Mr. Steven's reactions when an upper class diplomat asks him esoteric foreign policy questions to demonstrate that the lower classes do not understand diplomacy.  A third amazing example of perfectly controlled acting is when Miss Kenton, the housekeeper, tells Mr. Stevens that she and her new boyfriend make jokes about how he sprinkles pepper on his food. In all these examples Hopkins shows us how deeply repressed emotion still reveals itself even when no overt emotion is demonstrated.Into this world of rigid control, his employer hires a new housekeeper, Miss Kenton, played to perfection by Emma Thompson. The film is a rare treat in that two of the most talented artists of the acting arts are paired together in a range of situations and emotional responses. Miss Kenton and Mr. Stevens have a range of struggles and power fights as they get to know each other, but eventually they warm to each other and Miss Kenton begins to try to break the icy veneer of professionalism and emotional distance that cover Mr. Stevens. She tries but his reluctance to engage at an intimate and emotional level stop the relationship/friendship from growing or moving forward.  In contrast to the slow moving sterile relationship of Mr. Stevens and Miss Kenton, Charlie the head footman, and Abigail, a housemaid, have fallen passionately in love with each other and plan to marry even though they have no resources or prospects other than their love. Emma Thompson tries to council Abigail but realizes that in some ways Abigail and Charlie are right. Charlie is well played by Ben Chaplin and Abigail is played well by Abigail Hopkins.It is not only his personal life where Mr. Stevens coolly represses vital signs. His employer, Lord Darlington, played well by James Fox, is a German sympathizer who feels that the Treaty of Versailles conditions were unfair to Germany and set Germany up for political turmoil. He continues to be a German apologist for the 10 years leading up to the war, connecting Germans with German sympathizers. Lord Darlington's godson, played by Hugh Grant, is a young reporter who is able to penetrate the work of the upper class British aristocrats who were German sympathizers. Gradually, and carefully, the film takes the viewer from the point where we understand and sympathize with Lord Darlington's concern for Germany to the point where the Nazi dominance makes support impossible for any sensible thoughtful person. The sympathizers remain sympathetic too long and thus border on treason and infamy. In the early stages of this process, Congressman Lewis from the USA, played by Christopher Reeve, participates in early discussions around diplomatic relationships with Germany but warns the English gentlemen that they were playing a diplomatic game best played by professional diplomats.Mr. Stevens represses his own emotions and his own critical judgment too long and too much, thus leaving us with a sad conclusion to a life not fully lived.

7184,A2NX99GVAX4TRP,0767802802,"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[81, 85]","Arguably Remains of the Day is the finest Mechant/Ivory film ever made.  Anthony Hopkins delivers perhaps his finest performance with an excellent ensemble cast that includes co-star Emma Thompson and  James Fox.  You'll also see Christopher Reeve and newcomer Hugh Grant on board.Merchant/Ivory films are often too precious and too tastefully presented to get overly excited about.  Despite how beautiful they may look, I often find myself restless and then unsatisfied with their films that are often  too stuffy and airless to ever experience more than once.Remains of the Day is a little masterpiece of a film -- A wonderful character study and period drama worth repeat viewings.The story is wonderfully framed in the present day of the 1950's, which sets the mood to enjoy the film's exquisite  earlier period details.  The film's stuffiness is natural because the story centers around the James Stevens (Anthony Hopkins) a butler who has takes great pride in being in complete servitude to his employer Lord Darlington (James Fox) and the large English country home he attends to.Most of the film concerns itself with the late 1930's and early 1940's during World War 2 and Stevens' recollections are centered around his very proper relationship with Sally Kenton (Emma Thompson) who worked as a domestic in the home along with him for many years.  Perhaps he can convince the new present day owners of the manor and to let Sally Kenton again work with him once again.Kenton and Stevens' made a great Domestic team, Stevens' recalls. In flashback we see Steven's life working as a butler for Lord Darlington and watching some of the influential politicians, Lords and ladies pass through the manor hallways.Hopkins' performance is one to savor and study.  His every inflection, glance, and expression carries several meanings.  The longing he feels for Sally  must be suppressed to perform his tasks to the utmost of perfection and Sally's personal feelings for Stevens must like-wise be held in check because they are first and foremost devoted to their duties.  They share a perfectionism and devotion to their work that nothing is allowed interfere with.If the film sounds dull and stiff, let me assure you that this is a film of such grace, beauty and near perfection that it will haunt you for several years.  You will focus on the smallest of details in the film and be richly rewarded for taking the time to do so.The film is rich in period details (the cinematographer was Tony Pierce-Roberts) and offers an impeccable production design by Luciana Arrighi (&quot;Anna and the King&quot;), set decoration by Ian Whittaker (Anna and the King) and wonderfully re-created period costumes by Jenny Beavan and John Bright.You won't forget the performances of Anthony Hopkins or Emma Thompson in Remains of the Day.DVD STUFF&quot;Remains of the Day&quot; is presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen.  A few minutes worth of minor print flaws and very occasional visible edge enhancements are the only minor drawbacks of this high quality presentation of  the film.  The picture is sharp and crisp, black levels are strong and colors are rich.The soundtrack of the film is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 though most of the audio is front and center.  The score is allowed to breathe around the room a bit but there is very little in the way of ambient noises of sound effects present which could have taken advantage of the the surround sound possibilities.  No hisses or pops of noticeable distraction are present.DVD EXTRAS:Plentiful extras include an exclusive 29 minute short documentary: The Remains of the Day: A Filmakers journey.  Crew and cast members along with novelist Kazuo Ishiguro,  producers Ismail Merchant and John Calley,  director James Ivory and composer Richard  Robbins  disucss the making of the film.  Stars featured include Hopkins, Thompson, Fox, and Reeve who offer some criticism of their performances and high praise for the work of their fellow cast members and the director.  It's a love-fest but one that has some restraint and gives some interesting behind the scenes details of interest particularly in how the period details were recreated so beautifully.There's a 15 minute featurette which examines the issue of appeasement and how the attitude was partially responsible for allowing Hitler and Germany to become so powerful.The  28 and a half minute HBO behind the scenes special from 1993 is more promotional in nature but of interest which features scenes for the film, behind the scenes footage and interviews.3 deleted scenes can be viewed with or without optional commentary.  They are presented in the open matte style which means viewers can see things like the boom mikes which are normally cropped out of the picture.  Many will find this particularly interesting which is why James Ivory wanted to show the deleted scenes in this manner.The commentary track on Remains of the Day is better than most. There are some long pauses in the commentary and some of it duplicates the information that is discussed on the documentaries.  There are also many minutes over the course of commentary devoted to participants complimenting each other and those involved in the production.  Emma Thompson is at times very funny, and livens things up when they get a little too slow and dry.  Mechant, Ivory and Thompson provide an informative detailed and worthwhile feature length commentary to the film.Remains of the Day is beautiful little masterpiece which features some incredible acting.  The film is rich with details and the DVD is packed with worthwhile extras which makes this a Special Edition DVD very much worth adding to your collection. .Christopher Jarmick, is the author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

I was glad I did. In fact, I was so impressed with this film that a week later I went out and bought the book, which is even better.First of all, the film is a tremendous visual treat. There are some great interior scenes of the Darlington mansion, and great colors inside and in the surrounding outside scenery. This is simply a beautiful film.Second, the acting of Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson was spectacular. They were riveting. The way they deliver dialog and the expressions of their faces.....magnificent acting. Thompson's sad look in the back of the bus near the end of the movie is the saddest, most haunting look on a person's face I have ever seen in 50 years of movie watching.Hopkins, one of the best actors of this generation, provides a tremendous character study of a man who has been taught that to be the best in his profession, he must suppress all emotion. In doing so, he never learns to think for himself and he misses out on what could have been the love of his life. In that regards, this is a very frustrating story.However, this isn't just a tragic romantic story. Hopkins' character is wonderful example, too, of unselfish devotion and dignified servitude in the face of any kind of circumstance.This is an extremely beautiful, intelligent and sensitive film.

7189,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,0767802802,Dai-keag-ity,"[4, 4]","The Remains of the Day is one of the better films to come out of Britain in a generation. It has a crisp plotline that never once sags, the setting in both the 1930's and mid-century is dead-on, and it possesses a stellar cast that includes Christopher Reeve, Emma Thompson, and Hugh Grant. The unquestioned star here is Anthony Hopkins, a masterful actor, who in my opinion is far more believable in this role than as the unblinking serial killer with the build of a penguin that too many Americans know him as.Superior to all other Merchant-Ivory (and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala) films, The Remains of the Day imparts a tale of latter-day regrets foreshadowed in its flashback from the post to the pre-World War Two biome that centered around the insular home and estate of a reactionary British lord, lately in sympathy with the ideology of Nazi Germany. The catch is that while Lord Darlington has despicable (and one suspects shallow) politics, he seems a decent man at heart, and there is a certain sense of the pitiable about him, as he is clearly a man who is lost in time.In service to this man is a butler called Stevens, played with perfection by an unassuming Anthony Hopkins. Stevens, as much an anachronism as his master, is in many ways the embodiment of all that is right with a domestic servant. He is loyal, mild-mannered, devoted, and all but devoid of any ""taint"" of distinct personality that might make him commit error in a position that requires him to be simultaneously omniscient and ignorant, on-hand, and yet unseen, informed, and yet opinionless. So intent is Stevens on mastering his career role that he shuts out those around him, be they family or would-be friend. Stevens is knowingly a party to several misdeeds of his employer, Lord Darlington, most notably in the dismissal of a pair of young Jewish women from Germany, lately employed within the household. Stevens assents to carry out Lord Darlington's firing of the blameless women, knowing this could mean their deportation back to the anti-Semitic climate of their homeland.Lastly there is the matter of unrequited love. When it should have been clear to Stevens, as it was long before clear to all viewers, that Emma Thompson's character, Miss Kenton, has fallen deeply in love with Stevens, the butler continues to shield himself against the implications of this attraction, even to the point of feigning ignorance of it. While later in the film, the part set in the post-war period, we learn of the sad fate of Lord Darlington, the real tragedy is Stevens' missed opportunity for happiness with Miss Kenton, long since departed from his life.Amazingly, this most perfect British drama of manners and mores was based on a novel written by a Japanese man, Kazuo Ishiguro, who gets everything right down to the tiniest bit of fluffy social nicety.

Well I was not disappointed; the performances by Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson alone make watching the movie worthwhile.Both characters come across as sympathetic and compelling; one feels a compassionate concern for the internal struggles experienced by James Stevens as he tries to live up to his goal of perfection. The doubt and confusion he feels as his pride and confidence in Lord Darlington is shattered; his decidedly mixed emotions as he contemplates his growing love for Mary Kenton, the Emma Thompson character. Mary, on the other hand is better prepared to face up to her feelings for James; although she realizes that she must proceed with caution. When her overtures are rebuffed, she must then decide how to deal with the rest of her life; her decisions lead her down a path with results that are not what she hoped for.The movie is touching and gives interesting insights into the situation in England just before WW II.

7193,A2KG8WLR1AKO12,0767802802,"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator""","[9, 11]","The very talented and versatile Anthony Hopkins is wonderfully cast as the English butler, Mister Stevens.  It is Steven's eager existential duty to serve  the master of the estate, Lord Darlington (James Fox), with unhesitating loyalty and meticulous dedication.  Class distinctions have usually been more important to  our British cousins.  This is a major reason why the American colonies revolted against the &quot;mad&quot; King George.  Most living in Great Britain some 60 years ago  considered their social status at birth as inescapable.  Once a servant, always a servant.  A Mister Stevens or the head housekeeper (played aptly by Emma  Thompson) would likely have looked askance at anyone suggesting they try to improve their lot in life.  Such hopes bordered on being perceived as unnatural, if not traitorous.Lord Darlington is an elitist who is easily seduced into embracing the Nazis as England's partners to usher in a new age of mutual prosperity and fellowship.  The film  suggests that Lord Darlington meant well, but was perhaps innocent and over his head concerning the true designs of the Nazis.  This irritated me to no end.  I am  convinced that most of these wealthy and powerful individuals were more than a little receptive toward the anti-Semitic underpinnings of Nazi ideology.  They  gratefully welcomed a philosophy advocating racial superiority.  Comradeship with committed Nazis also reinforced the self image of the Lord Darlingtons as the homo sapiens most deserving to be the leaders of their respective political and cultural institutions.  A pecking order exists in nature, and the gods of the universe have  positioned them at the very top rung of the evolutionary ladder.There is one very powerful scene that demands our rapt attention.  Master Stevens is serving drinks to Lord Darlington and a few of his Nazi guests when one of  the latter begins to insult the dutiful butler.  The condescending guest asks Master Stevens questions about particularly difficult political issues of the moment.  Stevens concedes that his lack of education prevents him from fully understanding these matters.  The man then sarcastically concludes that Master Stevens is a  quintessential reason why democracy is doomed to fail.  Only the elites have any business being involved in politics, he adds.  The guest rejects the very premise of  democracy that declares ordinary and modestly educated people along with the elites are more than capable of forming a workable political system.  Moreover, we hold that the  basic commonsense of the hoi polloi often balances out the sometimes ethereal unrealistic speculations of the elites.  The ordinary person is not an idiot to be marginalized, but may have much to add. Is such a system perfect?  No, but as Winston  Churchill once said, its still the best system devised in human history.  Elitist governments, on the other, inherently tend to be tyrannical and unjust.This is a gorgeous film to view.  Much care was given in making &quot;Remains of the Day&quot; as authentic looking as possible.  The dedication and commitment of those  who made this movie possible is to be commended.  These artists had to love this project because it's most probable they took a huge cut in pay.  The film is  unfortunately also timeless.  &quot;Remains of the Day&quot; will be forevermore relevant.  The at least metaphorical reality of Original Sin is alive and well on planet earth,  and some people will always want to look down on their fellow citizens.  &quot;Remains of the Day&quot; will provide you with much to think about.",5,Remains of the Days Explores Issues of Elitism vs. Democracy,974937600,"11 23, 2000",2000,3594,"['very', 'talented', 'versatile', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'wonderfully', 'cast', 'English', 'butler', 'Mister', 'Stevens', 'Steven', 'eager', 'existential', 'duty', 'serve', 'master', 'estate', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'James', 'Fox', 'unhesitating', 'loyalty', 'meticulous', 'dedication', 'Class', 'distinctions', 'have', 'usually', 'been', 'more', 'important', 'British', 'cousins', 'major', 'reason', 'why', 'American', 'colonies', 'revolted', 'quot', 'quot', 'King', 'George', 'Most', 'living', 'Great', 'Britain', '60', 'years', 'ago', 'considered', 'social', 'status', 'birth', 'inescapable', 'Once', 'servant', 'always', 'servant', 'Mister', 'Stevens', 'head', 'housekeeper', 'played', 'aptly', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'would', 'likely', 'have', 'looked', 'askance', 'anyone', 'suggesting', 'try', 'improve', 'lot', 'life', 'Such', 'hopes', 'bordered', 'being', 'perceived', 'unnatural', 'not', 'traitorous.Lord', 'Darlington', 'elitist', 'who', 'easily', 'seduced', 'embracing', 'Nazis', 'England', 'partners', 'usher', 'new', 'age', 'mutual', 'prosperity', 'fellowship', 'film', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'meant', 'well', 'was', 'perhaps', 'innocent', 'head', 'concerning', 'true', 'designs', 'Nazis', 'irritated', 'end', 'am', 'convinced', 'most', 'wealthy', 'powerful', 'individuals', 'were', 'more', 'little', 'receptive', 'anti-Semitic', 'underpinnings', 'Nazi', 'ideology', 'gratefully', 'welcomed', 'philosophy', 'advocating', 'racial', 'superiority', 'Comradeship', 'committed', 'Nazis', 'also', 'reinforced', 'self', 'image', 'Lord', 'Darlingtons', 'homo', 'most', 'deserving', 'be', 'leaders', 'respective', 'political', 'cultural', 'institutions', 'pecking', 'order', 'exists', 'nature', 'gods', 'universe', 'have', 'positioned', 'very', 'top', 'rung', 'evolutionary', 'ladder.There', 'one', 'very', 'powerful', 'scene', 'rapt', 'attention', 'Master', 'Stevens', 'serving', 'drinks', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'few', 'Nazi', 'guests', 'when', 'one', 'latter', 'begins', 'insult', 'dutiful', 'butler', 'condescending', 'guest', 'asks', 'Master', 'Stevens', 'questions', 'particularly', 'difficult', 'political', 'issues', 'moment', 'Stevens', 'lack', 'education', 'prevents', 'fully', 'understanding', 'matters', 'man', 'then', 'sarcastically', 'Master', 'Stevens', 'quintessential', 'reason', 'why', 'democracy', 'doomed', 'fail', 'Only', 'elites', 'have', 'business', 'being', 'involved', 'politics', 'guest', 'very', 'premise', 'democracy', 'ordinary', 'modestly', 'educated', 'people', 'elites', 'are', 'more', 'capable', 'forming', 'workable', 'political', 'system', 'Moreover', 'hold', 'basic', 'commonsense', 'hoi', 'polloi', 'often', 'out', 'sometimes', 'ethereal', 'unrealistic', 'speculations', 'elites', 'ordinary', 'person', 'not', 'idiot', 'be', 'marginalized', 'may', 'have', 'much', 'add', 'such', 'system', 'perfect', 'No', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'once', 'said', 'still', 'best', 'system', 'devised', 'human', 'history', 'Elitist', 'governments', 'other', 'inherently', 'tend', 'be', 'tyrannical', 'unjust.This', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'view', 'Much', 'care', 'was', 'given', 'making', 'quot', 'Remains', 'Day', 'quot', 'authentic', 'looking', 'possible', 'dedication', 'commitment', 'who', 'made', 'movie', 'possible', 'be', 'commended', 'artists', 'had', 'love', 'project', 'most', 'probable', 'took', 'huge', 'cut', 'pay', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'also', 'timeless', 'quot', 'Remains', 'Day', 'quot', 'will', 'be', 'forevermore', 'relevant', 'least', 'metaphorical', 'reality', 'Original', 'Sin', 'alive', 'well', 'planet', 'earth', 'people', 'will', 'always', 'want', 'look', 'down', 'fellow', 'citizens', 'quot', 'Remains', 'Day', 'quot', 'will', 'provide', 'much', 'think']",N/A

Based on the wonderful novel by Kazuo Ishiguro (NEVER LET ME GO) this outstanding Merchant Ivory production stars Anthony Hopkins as the ice-encrusted butler who cannot-- or will not-- come out of his shell and respond to the housekeeper played by Emma Thompson in this beautifully photographed film as only the Merchant/Ivory team can do. Hopkins goes to the heart of this movie when he says ""what a terrible mistake I've made with my life."" He learns too late that one does not always get a second chance at happiness. Missed opportunities do not come back again. The film is also about Lord Darlington's (for whom Thompson and Hopkins work) coziness with the Nazis-- the action begins in 1935 when Hitler is already a threat over parts of Europe. There is a particularly poignant scene where Hopkins at his employer's command sends away two young Jewish maids only because they are Jewish.In addition to the brilliant performances by Thompson and Hopkins-- both were nominated for Oscars [the film received 8 in all]-- James Fox, Christopher Reeve and Hugh Grant are outstanding as well.

The servants of these lords are a species of servants quite different from anything we can imagine and Anthony Hopkins is making the depicting and rendering of this profession one of the most perfect and intriguing pieces of cinema about the humanity of these servants. It is true English literature is absolutely full of models, including Shakespeare though this latter one preferred his nurses and maids insolent and witty. Are they still humans, or are they robots. We will actually never know. They are able to behave and react along the same line no matter what happens. His old father trips and hurts himself, his old father dies during his service, fascists from Germany are roaming around and trying to manipulate the Prime Minister and the Lord his highness and lordship, an American delegate slaps them all across the face by calling them amateurs, his housekeeper leaves him to marry and ends up crying all her heart out, two Jewish refugees are fired because they are Jewish, anything, really anything may happen and nothing will change the course of their service, of their life of service. They don't hear, they don't see, they don't think, they don't know anything, anyone, anywhere and at any time. Never will one single word stand out in the discourse of these servants, not one button be untied, not one shoe be unpolished, one hair stand upright instead of being curbed down. They are automatons that are just intelligent enough to pass the wine around and not pour mustard in the glasses. That world has vanished of course, mostly, and such caricatures of humanity have been mostly erased from our memory, especially since television has produced innumerable funny comedies on such valets in today's world. So why do they do it? To live well without having to think of any problem or difficulty? Anything and everything is taken care of? They are wing props that will never come on stage and shine but they like obscurity, shadow, shade, invisibility? Apart from that quaint vision of a quaint world that has disappeared, thanks God in any religion imaginable, what's left? People who can look on their lives and consider that they have achieved nothing, they have reached no real target, they have been no one, no one of any importance, they have shown no self pride and no self esteem because the self is just beyond that world for servants. Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson play their parts with so much truth and dedication that we even believe after all it might have been a good thing. They would have accepted to be thrown alive into the incinerators in Auschwitz or Buchenwald and they may even have said ""Thank you, Sir, and I am glad I can be of service!""

7218,A1345VRK5MYG7,0767802802,James L.,"[50, 53]","Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson give superlative performances as the head butler and housekeeper at Darlington Hall in pre-WWII England, where personal and international dramas are enacted.  Set in the present, the film uses flashbacks to tell the stories of servants and Lord Darlington, a misguided gentleman who believed appeasement with Germany was the solution in the years leading to the Second World War.  Hopkins is his very officious butler, a man who places duty and propriety above all things, even his true feelings for housekeeper Thompson.  She is more forthcoming with her emotions, but she cannot bring him to open himself up, including a painfully well-acted scene where Thompson tries to get Hopkins to reveal to her the book he is reading.If you are looking for loads of action and music-video style editing, this film will not be for you.  It is a character and class study, and it succeeds admirably well on both levels.  Hopkins and Thompson are both able to communicate subtle emotions with a simple pause or a look.  The supporting cast is also fine.  The screenplay allows the characters and drama to unfold slowly, establishing a feeling for the time and for the differences in class that existed in the era.Remains of the Day is directed with understated style, allowing the setting and characters to dominate. Although it may be more literary than most films, don't mistake it for something stuffy or inaccessible.

Their films were the quintessential cinematic epics respectful of both the settings and characters adapted from both period and contemporary novels, blessed frequently with elegant scripts from their literary partner Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, and of course superb acting from their casts. ""Remains of the Day"" excels in all of these categories, as a spellbinding, faithful adaptation of the Kazuo Ishiguro novel, with Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson as the star-crossed would-be lovers and servants of the pacifist Nazi sympathizer Lord Darlington (James Fox). Along with elegant acting from both Hopkins and Thompson in two of their finest roles, there is splendid acting too from the likes of James Fox, Christopher Reeve, Ben Chaplin, and a young Hugh Grant as Lord Darlington's godson.James Ivory's masterful direction takes the audience to and fro between the mid 1930s and the early 1960s, focusing our attention on the chief butler Mr. Stevens (Anthony Hopkins) and the housekeeper Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson), who gradually realize that they are attracted to each other. But alas Stevens, like his master, Lord Darlington, puts his mistaken notions of duty and honor before passion, making a decision he will find himself regretting, albeit for a brief while, years later, when he seeks out Ms. Kenton in a brief, bittersweet reunion for both.

7231,A2O7P0578BBFBB,0767802802,K. Doyle,"[0, 0]","I suppose some would say, that the way we handle our emotions is what separates us from animals.  And while I don't necessarily disagree with that, I'd have to add that the way we handle our emotions is what separates us from machines.  Our emotions are what make us who we are, what make us human.  But in some people and/or at some times, those emotions are not to be allowed to exist, tightly controlled for fear of potentially adverse consequences.That some people would think that it is never appropriate to show emotions is something that surprised me when I first encountered it, but I have and not just in the movies.  In ""The Remains of the Day,"" the threat posed by emotions is simply one of a particular inappropriateness in the job environment, but with some people it is seen as always inappropriate because of the negative effects that emotions have perhaps too-often had previously in someone's life.  There's no evidence that Hopkins' character is in the latter camp, but he has clearly gotten so wrapped up in his job that he cannot separate it from his personal life.In this movie, Hopkins amazingly shows us what it might be like to be someone so repressed and out of touch with their emotions that they have become not perhaps, a machine, but certainly a hollow and pathetic creature.  The scene with Lord Darlington shortly after Stevens' (Hopkins) father dies is classic, you can see his struggle to keep his emotions from distracting him from his job to the point that the characteristically oblivious Darlington actually begins to notice, but the only character who is really in a position to understand what is happening with Stevens is Emma Thompson's Miss Kenton.By the end of the movie, the tears coming from Thompson's character seem less from unrequited love than overwhelming pity for the still-unable-to-emote Stevens.  Thompson's character has become closer to Hopkins' than anyone else over his entire adult life, and if that isn't the definition of pathetic, I don't know what is.

First, it's too long, its pacing a tad too slow. There are only a couple of themes in the film and they are played to death. We get it: Stevens (Hopkins) puts service to his master above everything else. Miss Kenton, however, (Thompson) doesn't get it. And refuses to. (Why is a mystery since it is clear from the tone of the film that Stevens' priority is nothing unusual; in fact, he tells Miss Kenton during her interview that if she's looking for love she's come to the wrong place.)I am not at all a fan of the all-too-common character arc that Hollywood insists on. Some characters simply don't change and for perfectly good reasons, they like the way they are and the way they are is just fine. But by not changing they have to accomplish something; they must win! And Stevens stays the same throughout and gets nothing for it. So what's the point, really, of the film? So many scenes are repetitive; when Miss Kenton is crying and Stevens comes in and tells her about the room that hasn't been dusted properly ... we already got it! Duty first! He's not interested in Miss Kenton! The Nazi sympathies ... again, done to death. This is where the film could have been and should have been cut, by 15 minutes, right after Miss Kenton tells Stevens that she has accepted her suitor's offer of marriage. No need to have the British PM and foreign sec visit the estate, no need to have the above-mentioned scene. The only necessary scene in that 15 minutes is Hugh Grant's asking of Stevens if he isn't the least bit curious of the goings-on downstairs, and Grant could have asked that during a previous here-come-the-Nazis scene.The handshake at the end, the hands slipping apart ... He should have grabbed her and held her and said, ""Miss Kenton, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."" THAT would have been enough. But the hands slipping away? Only in Black Narcissus did that touch work, a better film, by a better director.And the book scene, where Miss Kenton takes the book from Stevens hands to see what he's reading, epitomizes the film. Great build-up, little payoff. (Sound and fury?) And what book was he reading?

It abounds in subtle, muted, deep emotions.Both Anthony Hopkins as Stevens, a repressed English Butler, and Emma Thompson, Miss Kenton, his spirited housekeeper, do outstanding acting performances.  The film is set in the 1930's - just before World War II, on a big English Estate, with many servants.  Lord Darlington (James Fox) is the Estate Owner, who has attached himself to the Nazi cause.  Stevens is his loyal, unwavering Butler who micro-manages, as well as lives to be a slave to his Lord Darlington. Mr Stevens noted, ""A man cannot call himself work contented, until he has done all he can, to be of service to his employer.""  Mr. Stevens anticipates every need and task.  The estate runs flawlessly.When hiring Miss Kenton as head housekeeper, Stevens emphasizes that he wants no ""romantic interests"" as it detracts from the service to the well-run estate.  He will not stand for that in her or her underlings.  She agrees.  Despite this, a deep unrequited love, respect and bond develop between her and Stevens.  He hires his failing and aging father at the same time.  Miss Kenton notes the deterioration of his father over a bit of time and makes Stevens face the facts to avoid any future embarrassment.  There is a moment his father falls - and starts to fail rapidly.  There is an important political meeting at the estate, so Stevens must oversee.  His father is dying upstairs.  Miss Kenton attends to his father, and gives him the news his father passed away.  She asks if he would like her to shut his eyes, until Stevens can leave his duties to see his father for the last time.  She does and takes care of details.Hugh Grant and Christopher Reeve are also in this movie as voices hoping to open the eyes of Lord Darlington.  They want him to see his mistake in being loyal to the Nazis and the risks and problems involved.  Stevens does not get involved, his allegiance is to the smooth running of the household.  He sees nor hears anything - nor does he repeat anything that would convey disloyalty to his employer.At one point he has a chance to leave the box he is in.  Miss Kenton gives him the opportunity to profess his feelings, but he is unwavering in his duty to the service of the estate.  Stevens makes his decision to stay and keep his life as it is, even though he loves her.  She leaves and marries another man.Time passes and they reunite for a few hours.  The poignant ending shows deep unfulfilled love.

This might seem like a fairly unimportant attribute of a film, but in Remains of the Day, the  flow of the film borders on perfect.  The direction glides along  effortlessly, with excellent editing and camerawork to boot.  Not once did  I feel a scene lingered to long, or was cut short.  The movie's content  matters, too, of course, and it is wonderful.  Hopkins and Thompson are  fantastic, and their relationship is one of the most involving and  heartbreaking I've ever scene of film.  The subplot concerning James Fox's  character's flirtations with foreign policy in the darkest of times is also  fascinating, and Ivory does a great job of giving all of the those scenes  an eerily grand, yet hopeless atmosphere.

7247,AX28GY1ZYYOXM,0767802802,Margaret P Harvey,"[2, 2]","With brilliant actors, a truly genius director and breathtaking scenery, &quot;Remains of the Day&quot; does not disappoint. A wonderful, if not so very sad story shines in this movie and is not butchered by this piece. But with all the sadness in the storyline, the movie is able to entertain you without leaving you reaching for Prozac. Understated and dark, one of the biggest surprises was not the deep feeling of the piece, but the sparkling gems of humor dispersed in the film. This movie made me laugh out loud, but more often it made me cry at the bitterness of this story's message. In this bittersweet love story, Hopkins flawlessly portrays a butler who is so out of touch with life that he lets the love of his life slip through his fingers. His performance was so breathtaking, as was Thompson's performance. I recommend this movie to any admirer of either actor, or of the director's flawless and (often depressing) style and genius. If you do not want to see a real think-piece that will made you cry at its sheer beauty and devastating truth, don't bother with &quot;Remains of the Day.&quot; But if you enjoy dark pieces full of artistic merit look into this film, which is genuinely worthy of being in the same class as &quot;Howard's End&quot; and &quot;Wings of the Dove.&quot;",5,Heartbreaking...,990921600,"05 27, 2001",2001,1297,"['brilliant', 'actors', 'truly', 'genius', 'director', 'breathtaking', 'scenery', 'quot', 'Remains', 'Day', 'quot', 'not', 'disappoint', 'wonderful', 'not', 'so', 'very', 'sad', 'story', 'shines', 'movie', 'not', 'butchered', 'piece', 'sadness', 'storyline', 'movie', 'able', 'entertain', 'leaving', 'reaching', 'Prozac', 'Understated', 'dark', 'one', 'biggest', 'surprises', 'was', 'not', 'deep', 'feeling', 'piece', 'sparkling', 'gems', 'humor', 'dispersed', 'film', 'movie', 'made', 'loud', 'more', 'often', 'made', 'cry', 'bitterness', 'story', 'message', 'bittersweet', 'love', 'story', 'Hopkins', 'flawlessly', 'butler', 'who', 'so', 'touch', 'life', 'love', 'life', 'slip', 'fingers', 'performance', 'was', 'so', 'breathtaking', 'was', 'Thompson', 'performance', 'recommend', 'movie', 'admirer', 'actor', 'director', 'flawless', 'often', 'depressing', 'style', 'genius', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'real', 'think-piece', 'will', 'made', 'cry', 'sheer', 'beauty', 'devastating', 'truth', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'quot', 'Remains', 'Day.', 'quot', 'enjoy', 'dark', 'pieces', 'full', 'artistic', 'merit', 'look', 'film', 'genuinely', 'worthy', 'being', 'same', 'class', 'quot', 'Howard', 'End', 'quot', 'quot', 'Wings', 'Dove.', 'quot']",N/A

It depicts life, especially the servants' life, in an English country house just before World War II.

It also details some of the politics of the day leading up to World War II and the part the Lord of the manor plays in them.

So it&#8217;s with relief that I can say the transfer of 1993&#8217;s &#34;The Remains Of The Day&#34; looks truly beautiful on this well laid out and well thought out 2013 Anniversary Edition BLU RAY.Tony Pierce-Robert&#8217;s masterful cinematography is brought out in a way you&#8217;ve never seen it before in this quality transfer. It&#8217;s defaulted to 2.40 (bars top and bottom) - but even stretched to full aspect &#8211; the grain on the huge number of indoor shots is very minimal. It fact giving the picture a bit of distance &#8211; it could be &#8220;Downton Abbey&#8221; in High Def &#8211; it&#8217;s that well filmed. Boarding House signs, the family Daimler car, the crunch of the gravel outside the huge Darlington House door, a bead of sweat dripping off the old man&#8217;s nose as he serves at table, the squeak of leather shoes, chucking water over a kitchen table to wash it &#8211; it all looks and sounds glorious.Anthony Hopkins (playing James Stevens) and Emma Thompson (playing Miss Kenton) had just come off &#34;Howard's End&#34; in 1991 &#8211; so they knew each other very well &#8211; and were ideal casting for this kind of material (Jeremy Irons and Meryl Streep were once muted for the parts with Mike Nichols as the Director). Equally impressive is James Fox as Lord Darlington, a young Hugh Grant (pre &#34;Four Weddings&#34; fame) and English stalwart Peter Vaughan playing Hopkins&#8217; frail father. There are also small parts for Ben Chaplin (ITV&#8217;s &#34;Mad Dogs&#34;) and Lena Headey (Queen Cersei Lannister in &#34;Game Of Thrones&#34;). This is a world where people say &#8220;my dear boy&#8221; at dinner, there are 12 for tea and a scullery maid who&#8217;s eloped with a footman is described as a &#8221;bad business&#8221;.The principal Extra &#8220;The Filmmaker&#8217;s Journey&#8221; features interviews with Hopkins, Thompson, James Fox and Christopher Reeves, Director James Ivory, Producers Ismail Merchant and James Calley and novelist Kazuo Ishiguro.AUDIO: English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French, German, Italian and Spanish Dolby SurroundSUBTITLES: English, English SDH, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Spanish and Swedish.EXTRAS:1.

7250,A36EW68H08UOCS,0767802802,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[2, 2]","""Remains of the Day"" is perhaps the quintessential Merchant-Ivory production.  Their films are models of British gentility - period pictures with handsome actors wearing tuxedoes in elaborate mansions.  With Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson reunited (after the fine ""Howard's End"") and a fine supporting cast including James Fox, Hugh Grant and Christopher Reeve, ""Remains of the Day"" SHOULD be something special, and it is.Hopkins plays Stevens, the head Butler of Darlington Manor, and a household so large that it employs a small army of cooks, footmen, under butlers and other servants.  Early in the film he hires Thompson's Miss Kenton as head housekeeper.  Stevens and Miss Kenton are consummate professionals - always on time, always reliable, and they lead the house staff keeping Darlington Manor looking like a museum.But Darlington Manor is not a museum.  It is the home of Lord Darlington, an English gentleman who saw German friends suffer and lose their shirt because of harsh penalties imposed on Germany after the First World War.  Lord Darlington is determined as a man of honor to see that Germany gets a fair shake in rebuilding their country, even as the specter of Hitler grows and threatens the remainder of Europe.The film elegantly portrays the parallel tragedies of Lord Darlington and his blindly loyal butler.  In retrospect it is easy to see how flawed Lord Darlington was to support Germany without question.  It is more difficult to fully appreciate Stevens' tragedies - first in loyally supporting Lord Darlington while he misguidedly directed England towards German acceptance, and secondly in placing all of his private life behind his devotion to duty.Stevens and Miss Kenton meet and maneuver and pirouette through Darlington Manor, each becoming more attracted to the other in their own way.  But while Miss Kenton is a kind-hearted woman eager to love and be loved, Stevens has let his professional ability to ""not get involved"" spill over to his personal life.  Despite his wishes and his repressed yet obvious affection for Miss Kenton, he maintains a respectful distance, resulting in his cruelest tragedy of all - breaking Miss Kenton's heart and, due to his inaction, his own.""Remains of the Day"" is a movie set before and after World War II, but it is not a ""War"" picture.  It is a movie to be appreciated by those who would be as interested in the back-door meetings of diplomats and ambassadors as in the soldier in the trenches.  Perhaps in that way it would be a perfect compliment to a film such as ""Saving Private Ryan"".For fans of Sir Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson or Merchant-Ivory films, I can't recommend it more highly.",5,Star-Crossed Lives in a British Manor,1123027200,"08 3, 2005",2005,2676,"['Remains', 'Day', 'perhaps', 'quintessential', 'Merchant-Ivory', 'production', 'films', 'are', 'models', 'British', 'gentility', 'period', 'pictures', 'handsome', 'actors', 'wearing', 'tuxedoes', 'elaborate', 'mansions', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'reunited', 'fine', 'Howard', 'End', 'fine', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'James', 'Fox', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Day', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'something', 'special', 'plays', 'Stevens', 'head', 'Butler', 'Darlington', 'Manor', 'household', 'so', 'large', 'small', 'army', 'cooks', 'footmen', 'butlers', 'other', 'servants', 'Early', 'film', 'Thompson', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'head', 'housekeeper', 'Stevens', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'are', 'consummate', 'professionals', 'always', 'time', 'always', 'reliable', 'lead', 'house', 'staff', 'keeping', 'Darlington', 'Manor', 'looking', 'museum.But', 'Darlington', 'Manor', 'not', 'museum', 'home', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'English', 'gentleman', 'who', 'saw', 'German', 'friends', 'suffer', 'lose', 'shirt', 'harsh', 'penalties', 'imposed', 'Germany', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'determined', 'man', 'honor', 'see', 'Germany', 'fair', 'shake', 'rebuilding', 'country', 'even', 'specter', 'Hitler', 'grows', 'remainder', 'Europe.The', 'film', 'elegantly', 'parallel', 'tragedies', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'blindly', 'loyal', 'butler', 'retrospect', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'flawed', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'was', 'support', 'Germany', 'question', 'more', 'difficult', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'Stevens', 'tragedies', 'first', 'loyally', 'supporting', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'misguidedly', 'directed', 'England', 'towards', 'German', 'acceptance', 'secondly', 'placing', 'private', 'life', 'devotion', 'duty.Stevens', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'meet', 'maneuver', 'pirouette', 'Darlington', 'Manor', 'becoming', 'more', 'attracted', 'other', 'own', 'way', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'kind-hearted', 'woman', 'eager', 'love', 'be', 'loved', 'Stevens', 'let', 'professional', 'ability', 'not', 'get', 'involved', 'spill', 'personal', 'life', 'wishes', 'repressed', 'yet', 'obvious', 'affection', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'respectful', 'distance', 'resulting', 'cruelest', 'tragedy', 'breaking', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'heart', 'due', 'inaction', 'own', 'Remains', 'Day', 'movie', 'set', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'not', 'War', 'picture', 'movie', 'be', 'appreciated', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'back-door', 'meetings', 'diplomats', 'ambassadors', 'soldier', 'trenches', 'Perhaps', 'way', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'compliment', 'film', 'such', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', '.For', 'fans', 'Sir', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Merchant-Ivory', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'more', 'highly']",N/A
7251,AAW58LG72PG7I,0767802802,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[6, 7]","Those who see REMAINS OF THE DAY expecting to see a plot driven film will have to recalibrate their thoughts to judge a movie that packs a series of major wallops expressed as the most subtle of nuance.  Director James Ivory offers a vision of England as a land of tradition that is based heavily on maintaining itself by denying the evidence that is right in front of their cultured noses. Anthony Hopkins is Stevens the Butler who has dedicated his life in the service of Lord Darlington (Edward Fox).  Being a butler is far more than the stereotyped gentleman's gentleman immortalized by an earlier generation's Arthur Treacher.  Stevens has learned all too well that for a butler to function he must repress any emotion that might conflict with his duties.  When Stevens' own father obtains employment as an under-butler, the younger Stevens treats his father with the same imperiousness as he does the other servants.  Tragically, when Stevens the elder dies of a stroke performing his duties, Stevens can do no more than attend to his other tasks.  Tragedy in REMAINS OF THE DAY emerges in other scenes as well.  Lord Darlington is a pro-Nazi sympathizer in the years just before Dunkirk.  He invites ranking Nazi officials to meet in his mansion to discuss the impending partition of Czechezlovakia.  Stevens is present during this meeting and when he is asked his opinion about that, he retreats behind his self-imposed wall of non-intervention.  Life, for Stevens, is always to take the path of least resistance.  This may work well on a professional level, but Hopkins as Stevens makes it clear that the better one is at doing precisely that the higher the price will be in emotional degradation.  Finally, there is Emma Thompson as Miss Kenton, a housekeeper who can sense that beneath Stevens' facade of imperturbability there exists a man with whom she might be attracted.  Stevens tries mightily to act professionally at all times but the more he succeeds the more trapped he reveals himself.  There is a poignant scene midway through when Miss Kenton interrupts Stevens in one of his moments of solitide.  He is reading a book that she thinks might be racy.  She asks to see it but he demurs.  She insistently pries his fingers to free the book as the camera lingers on his face to reveal his inner turmoil.  The ending, which I shall not reveal here, is the crux of the film.  When twenty years after she has quit to marry and he goes to see her to ask if she will agree to return to service, the viewer wonders which is the stronger--his sense of honor and tradition or his desire for her which he has successfully repressed for decades.  The answer is that for each person there is a lifetime of experience that will determine the outcome.

7252,A2FHQVL4ZG0E1O,0767802802,"MartinP ""MartinP""","[2, 3]","Merchant & Ivory turned Ishiguro's elegant novel into a quiet, stylish movie that is thoroughly gripping if you're even remotely responsive to truly great character acting. The only thing that is conspicuously absent from the film while being one of the main attractions of the novel, is the at times outrageously funny element of comedy that lightened the generally melancholy tone of the story. All that's left of it is the butlers cumbersome attempt to acquaint his Lordhip's nephew (Hugh Grant in pre-celeb days) with the facts of life; which, standing on its own as it does in the movie, seems misplaced and fails to be funny at all.Hopkins and Thompson however work miracles and are the engine of the movie: Stevens, the butler, and Ms. Kenton, the housekeeper, whom they respectively portray, are two quirky characters who develop a touching, but barely acknowledged attachment to each other during their years of service at Darlington Hall. Much of the story takes place in the nineteen thirties, and while the main protagonists are busy keeping the house in order and getting to grips with each other, His Lordship (who else but Edward Fox), all naive good intentions, dabbles in politics and gets involved with Chamberlain's foolheaded appeasement policies and, by extension, with the nazis. Stevens sees it all happening before his eyes, but reserves judgment: he is there ""to serve Lord Darlington, not to agree or disagree"". Instead, he slavisly allows himself to be used in a callous parlour game of several of his masters friends, who flaunt his lack of political opinion as proof that democracy is madness. His sense of duty completely usurps his sense of personal responsibility, and eventually even causes this most genteel of men to behave in ways that are unfeeling, if not thoroughly reprehensible. Ms. Kenton is less placid, but has other reasons not to revolt. Loneliness, a disability to communicate, and emotional repression are the core themes of the movie, so don't expect any spectacular superficial drama. The pace is slow, arguably too slow at times. However, while the souls of butler and housekeeper are patiently laid bare, the viewer is regaled with some truly marvellous recreations of the Indian summer of English country house ife - busy downstairs activity, lawn meet and lavish dinner parties included. The locations are excellent, though interior and exterior scenes were shot at different houses and it is hard not to notice that the supposed rooms of Darlington hall are a bit too sizeable, sumptuous and numerous to actually fit within the modest shell of Dyrham Park, that stands in for its outside. Nonetheless, a great film that can be enjoyed on several levels.",4,"Beautiful, touching, but lacking in humour",1123372800,"08 7, 2005",2005,2708,"['Merchant', 'Ivory', 'turned', 'Ishiguro', 'elegant', 'novel', 'quiet', 'stylish', 'movie', 'thoroughly', 'gripping', ""'re"", 'even', 'remotely', 'responsive', 'truly', 'great', 'character', 'acting', 'only', 'thing', 'conspicuously', 'absent', 'film', 'being', 'one', 'main', 'attractions', 'novel', 'times', 'outrageously', 'funny', 'element', 'comedy', 'lightened', 'generally', 'melancholy', 'tone', 'story', 'left', 'butlers', 'cumbersome', 'attempt', 'acquaint', 'Lordhip', 'nephew', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'pre-celeb', 'days', 'facts', 'life', 'standing', 'own', 'movie', 'misplaced', 'be', 'funny', 'all.Hopkins', 'Thompson', 'however', 'work', 'miracles', 'are', 'engine', 'movie', 'Stevens', 'butler', 'Ms.', 'Kenton', 'housekeeper', 'whom', 'respectively', 'portray', 'are', 'two', 'quirky', 'characters', 'who', 'develop', 'touching', 'barely', 'acknowledged', 'attachment', 'other', 'years', 'service', 'Darlington', 'Hall', 'Much', 'story', 'place', 'nineteen', 'thirties', 'main', 'protagonists', 'are', 'busy', 'keeping', 'house', 'order', 'getting', 'grips', 'other', 'Lordship', 'who', 'else', 'Edward', 'Fox', 'naive', 'good', 'intentions', 'dabbles', 'politics', 'involved', 'Chamberlain', 'foolheaded', 'appeasement', 'policies', 'extension', 'nazis', 'happening', 'eyes', 'reserves', 'judgment', 'there', 'serve', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'not', 'agree', 'disagree', 'Instead', 'slavisly', 'be', 'used', 'callous', 'parlour', 'game', 'several', 'masters', 'friends', 'who', 'flaunt', 'lack', 'political', 'opinion', 'proof', 'democracy', 'madness', 'sense', 'duty', 'completely', 'usurps', 'sense', 'personal', 'responsibility', 'eventually', 'even', 'most', 'genteel', 'men', 'behave', 'ways', 'are', 'unfeeling', 'not', 'thoroughly', 'reprehensible', 'Ms.', 'Kenton', 'less', 'placid', 'other', 'reasons', 'not', 'revolt', 'Loneliness', 'disability', 'communicate', 'emotional', 'repression', 'are', 'core', 'themes', 'movie', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'spectacular', 'superficial', 'drama', 'pace', 'slow', 'arguably', 'too', 'slow', 'times', 'However', 'souls', 'butler', 'housekeeper', 'are', 'patiently', 'laid', 'bare', 'viewer', 'regaled', 'truly', 'marvellous', 'recreations', 'Indian', 'summer', 'English', 'country', 'house', 'busy', 'downstairs', 'activity', 'lawn', 'meet', 'lavish', 'dinner', 'parties', 'included', 'locations', 'are', 'excellent', 'interior', 'exterior', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'different', 'houses', 'hard', 'not', 'notice', 'supposed', 'rooms', 'Darlington', 'hall', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'sizeable', 'sumptuous', 'numerous', 'actually', 'fit', 'modest', 'shell', 'Dyrham', 'Park', 'outside', 'Nonetheless', 'great', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'several', 'levels']",N/A

7256,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,0767802802,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[11, 12]","Set against the backdrop of an impending WWII, this Merchant Ivory production tells the story of unrequited love between two servants working in a British stately home.Anthony Hopkins is the punctilious butler James Stevens and Emma Thompson is the feisty housekeeper Sally Kenton, who work in the service of the slightly pompous and very misguided Lord Darlington (James Fox). Stevens and Kenton fall in love with each other but neither is prepared to reveal their true feelings. Meanwhile, Stevens the butler demonstrates blind loyalty to his master Lord Darlington, even when Darlington makes very ill advised contact with the Nazis.This is very much a low-burn movie. On the surface it may seem that very little happens in this 1993 Merchant-Ivory production but paradoxically there is actually so much to view and so much to think about. Apart from the love story that is central to the plot of the whole movie, it is also a story of misguided actions, repression and misguided loyalty. Director James Ivory (Howard's End, A Room With A View etc.) once again beautifully recreates an important time in British history and fills it with sartorial elegance. As always, Anthony Hopkins in another Oscar nominated performance, is magnificent as the emotionally repressed butler Stevens and he is well matched by the equally magnificent, also Oscar nominated, Thompson as Sally Kenton, who like Hopkins gives a performance of incredible depth and subtlety. What's more, there are also excellent supporting performances from James Fox, Christopher Reeve, Ben Chaplin, and Hugh Grant. (The DVD also has some very good extras, including three featurettes, feature commentary by Thompson and Ivory, the original theatrical trailer and filmographies. It also contains deleted scenes which would have made certain themes more explicit and that would have ultimately detracted from the film).If you are feeling a bit low this is not the movie to watch but for fans of well-acted adult drama, this has a mournful resonance and is highly recommended.",4,MOURNFUL RESONANCE,1013385600,"02 11, 2002",2002,2041,"['Set', 'backdrop', 'impending', 'WWII', 'Merchant', 'Ivory', 'production', 'story', 'unrequited', 'love', 'two', 'servants', 'working', 'British', 'stately', 'home.Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'punctilious', 'butler', 'James', 'Stevens', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'feisty', 'housekeeper', 'Sally', 'Kenton', 'who', 'work', 'service', 'slightly', 'pompous', 'very', 'misguided', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'James', 'Fox', 'Stevens', 'Kenton', 'fall', 'love', 'other', 'prepared', 'reveal', 'true', 'feelings', 'Meanwhile', 'butler', 'loyalty', 'master', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'even', 'when', 'Darlington', 'very', 'ill', 'advised', 'contact', 'Nazis.This', 'very', 'much', 'low-burn', 'movie', 'surface', 'may', 'seem', 'very', 'little', 'happens', '1993', 'Merchant-Ivory', 'production', 'paradoxically', 'actually', 'so', 'much', 'view', 'so', 'much', 'think', 'Apart', 'love', 'story', 'central', 'plot', 'whole', 'movie', 'also', 'story', 'misguided', 'actions', 'repression', 'misguided', 'loyalty', 'Director', 'James', 'Ivory', 'Howard', 'End', 'Room', 'A', 'View', 'etc', 'once', 'again', 'beautifully', 'important', 'time', 'British', 'history', 'sartorial', 'elegance', 'always', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', 'magnificent', 'emotionally', 'repressed', 'butler', 'Stevens', 'well', 'matched', 'equally', 'magnificent', 'also', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Thompson', 'Sally', 'Kenton', 'who', 'Hopkins', 'performance', 'incredible', 'depth', 'subtlety', 'What', 'more', 'are', 'also', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'performances', 'James', 'Fox', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'DVD', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'extras', 'including', 'three', 'featurettes', 'feature', 'commentary', 'Thompson', 'Ivory', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'filmographies', 'also', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'certain', 'themes', 'more', 'explicit', 'would', 'have', 'ultimately', 'detracted', 'film', '.If', 'are', 'feeling', 'bit', 'low', 'not', 'movie', 'watch', 'fans', 'well-acted', 'adult', 'drama', 'mournful', 'resonance', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

As a reviewer of both films, I find myself torn to comment on which is the better movie.  Quite simply, each is brilliant.  In ""The Remains of the Day"" Hopkins is Mr. Stevens, a butler at Darlington Hall who is so deeply steeped in the traditions of the Edwardian class that he cannot bring himself to express his love for the head housekeeper, Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson).  James Fox is cast is Lord Darlington, an English gentleman who unfortunately becomes one of the Nazi's pawns during World War II.  Also in the cast are Hugh Grant and Christopher Reeves.Columbia's special edition is an above average attempt for the studio.  But the transfer lacks the vibrancy of its predicessor.  Colors are accurate.  Details can be sharp.  Sometimes the picture is excessively soft or slightly smeared, the result of noise reduction equipment employed during the film's remastering to DVD.  Contrast levels can appear slightly low at times.  There is even some minor aliasing and pixelization that creeps in.  I should like to point out that, while none of these imperfections is glaringly prominent throughout the movie, they are all present nevertheless.  The sound has been nicely remixed to 5.1.  Extras include a documentary and audio commentary as well as the original featurette produced at the time the film was being made.  All of these are substandard in terms of image quality, suffering from compression related artifacts.

7263,A2VK365XEVCYC8,0767802802,One More Option,"[5, 7]","If you haven't seen this movie and are asking, ""Is it recommendable?""  The answer is enthusiastically yes.  If you liked the movie and are asking, ""Should I buy or rent the DVD?""  The answer is yes.  The bonus materials are excellent at expressing the intents of the creators of the film.  Ishiguro says in a featurette, ""I intended the story to be one that could take off quite easily into the metaphorical sphere, so that people could actually apply it to their own lives . . . I wanted it to be universal, human story . . . If I was writing a how to book on how to waste your life, the English butler idea encapsulated two good, decent ways in which you could waste your life. One was emotionally, and the other was politically."" John Calley, the producer, said, ""We were just dazzled by the possibilities of dramatizing missed chances, lost opportunities - the things that were all victim of inappropriate allegiances that lead to a finally disappointing conclusion.""If you are asking, ""Is the film still relevant today?""  An answer is:  The film is set in pre-WW II, in an era where there were calls for universal military service, suppression of free speech, military aggression against foreign nations, & discrimination against ""lesser"" races.  The story looks at the ethics of national & international safety & civil liberties.  I don't think this is a pacifist film. It appears to be more anti-appeasement. It encourages people to be politically and personally involved. I don't think Ishiguro wants people to be unopinionated, non-vocal, & dutiful butlers who neither develop educated opinions nor express them in times of genuine danger & conflict.This movie suggests 'peaceful silence' is sometimes a dangerous assumption.  If someone wants to perpetuate war & violence, they often both deter free speech and avoid non-domestic diplomacy, because public, open, & transparent diplomacy is often the most effective means of ending a conflict and improving relations.  Does a leader who cuts off diplomatic relations genuinely want better relations between nations?  Ishiguro suggests in the DVD extras that the Nazis took advantage of certain high ranking English officials' gentlemanly and honorable ideals to keep them silent, agreeable, and non-confrontive while Germany's actions killed millions of Jews and other ""lesser"" races under the misused banners of loyalty, honor, & peace. ""Remains"" is about failed diplomatic methods. It is a film that encourages finding better diplomatic methods.If Spielberg's ""Munich"" lays out a convincing argument that violent response usually begets more violence, Ishiguro's ""Remains"" & Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" & ""Saving Private Ryan"" ask: Did responsive violence prevent even more loss of life?The housekeeper asks Mr. Stevens, the head of the household staff, why does he not help two hard working Jewish servant girls who are being prejudicially discharged, exposing them to likely violence.  Mr. Stevens' response is always to defer to his master and the popular social guidelines, so he says, ""It's out of our hands.""  He makes no attempts to seek information to come to their aid, and he seeks no interventive path that might create social conflict.Stevens: ""You are extremely important to this house, Miss Kenton""Miss Kenton: ""Am I?""Under the definitions of that era, Stevens was an ideal, deferential butler, dutifully allowing others to ultimately choose his actions. We can all watch him and think we would take an unpopular stance to assist others, but it's far more complicated & difficult with real relationships, work pressures, and social dangers.There are a many reasons why the married housekeeper turns the tables on Mr. Stevens in the end.  She deters any substantive or emotional communication.  She extincts his inquiries, changes the subject, & repeatedly turns the conversation to small talk. We can watch them and be frustrated with BOTH of them for the choices they made at different times.  Will the patterns of the past change the cycle of results?  Or can anything better be done in the remains of the day?Miss Kenton: ""What's in that book? C'mon let me see. Or are you protecting me? Is that what you are doing? Would it ruin my character? Let me see it . . . oh dear, it's not scandalous at all . . . it's just a sentimental old love story.""",5,Can Anything Better Be Done In The Remains of The Day?,1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,4327,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'are', 'asking', 'recommendable', 'answer', 'enthusiastically', 'yes', 'liked', 'movie', 'are', 'asking', 'Should', 'buy', 'rent', 'DVD', 'answer', 'yes', 'bonus', 'materials', 'are', 'excellent', 'expressing', 'intents', 'creators', 'film', 'Ishiguro', 'featurette', 'intended', 'story', 'be', 'one', 'could', 'take', 'off', 'quite', 'easily', 'metaphorical', 'sphere', 'people', 'could', 'actually', 'apply', 'own', 'lives', 'wanted', 'be', 'universal', 'human', 'story', 'was', 'writing', 'how', 'book', 'how', 'waste', 'life', 'English', 'butler', 'idea', 'encapsulated', 'two', 'good', 'decent', 'ways', 'could', 'waste', 'life', 'One', 'was', 'emotionally', 'other', 'was', 'politically', 'John', 'Calley', 'producer', 'said', 'were', 'just', 'dazzled', 'possibilities', 'dramatizing', 'missed', 'chances', 'lost', 'opportunities', 'things', 'were', 'victim', 'inappropriate', 'allegiances', 'lead', 'finally', 'disappointing', 'conclusion', 'are', 'asking', 'film', 'still', 'relevant', 'today', 'answer', 'film', 'set', 'pre-WW', 'II', 'era', 'where', 'were', 'calls', 'universal', 'military', 'service', 'suppression', 'free', 'speech', 'military', 'aggression', 'foreign', 'nations', 'discrimination', 'lesser', 'races', 'story', 'ethics', 'national', 'international', 'safety', 'civil', 'liberties', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'pacifist', 'film', 'be', 'more', 'anti-appeasement', 'people', 'be', 'politically', 'personally', 'involved', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Ishiguro', 'people', 'be', 'unopinionated', 'non-vocal', 'dutiful', 'butlers', 'who', 'neither', 'develop', 'educated', 'opinions', 'express', 'times', 'genuine', 'danger', 'conflict.This', 'movie', ""'peaceful"", 'silence', 'sometimes', 'dangerous', 'assumption', 'someone', 'perpetuate', 'war', 'violence', 'often', 'deter', 'free', 'speech', 'avoid', 'non-domestic', 'diplomacy', 'public', 'open', 'transparent', 'diplomacy', 'often', 'most', 'effective', 'means', 'ending', 'conflict', 'improving', 'relations', 'leader', 'who', 'off', 'diplomatic', 'relations', 'genuinely', 'want', 'better', 'relations', 'nations', 'Ishiguro', 'DVD', 'Nazis', 'took', 'advantage', 'certain', 'high', 'ranking', 'English', 'officials', 'gentlemanly', 'honorable', 'ideals', 'keep', 'silent', 'agreeable', 'non-confrontive', 'Germany', 'actions', 'killed', 'millions', 'Jews', 'other', 'lesser', 'races', 'misused', 'banners', 'loyalty', 'honor', 'peace', 'Remains', 'about', 'failed', 'diplomatic', 'methods', 'film', 'finding', 'better', 'diplomatic', 'methods.If', 'Spielberg', 'Munich', 'out', 'convincing', 'argument', 'violent', 'response', 'usually', 'more', 'violence', 'Ishiguro', 'Remains', 'Spielberg', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'ask', 'Did', 'responsive', 'violence', 'prevent', 'even', 'more', 'loss', 'life', 'housekeeper', 'Mr.', 'Stevens', 'head', 'household', 'staff', 'why', 'not', 'help', 'two', 'hard', 'working', 'Jewish', 'servant', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'prejudicially', 'discharged', 'exposing', 'likely', 'violence', 'Mr.', 'Stevens', 'response', 'always', 'defer', 'master', 'popular', 'social', 'guidelines', 'hands', 'attempts', 'seek', 'information', 'come', 'aid', 'interventive', 'path', 'might', 'create', 'social', 'conflict.Stevens', 'are', 'extremely', 'important', 'house', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'Am', 'definitions', 'era', 'Stevens', 'was', 'ideal', 'deferential', 'butler', 'dutifully', 'allowing', 'others', 'ultimately', 'choose', 'actions', 'can', 'watch', 'think', 'would', 'take', 'unpopular', 'stance', 'assist', 'others', 'far', 'more', 'complicated', 'difficult', 'real', 'relationships', 'work', 'pressures', 'social', 'dangers.There', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'why', 'married', 'housekeeper', 'tables', 'Mr.', 'Stevens', 'end', 'substantive', 'emotional', 'communication', 'inquiries', 'subject', 'repeatedly', 'conversation', 'small', 'talk', 'can', 'watch', 'be', 'frustrated', 'BOTH', 'choices', 'made', 'different', 'times', 'Will', 'patterns', 'past', 'change', 'cycle', 'results', 'can', 'anything', 'better', 'be', 'done', 'remains', 'day', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'What', 'book', ""C'mon"", 'let', 'see', 'are', 'protecting', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'Would', 'ruin', 'character', 'Let', 'see', 'oh', 'dear', 'not', 'scandalous', 'just', 'sentimental', 'old', 'love', 'story']",N/A
7264,A2K3UTNW0783U6,0767802802,Phillip Kay,"[10, 10]","Memories both good and bad light up what yet remains of the day. This is the story of how a man finds comfort in remembering what he has achieved, and what he has lost.Remains of the Day saw the reuniting of the Merchant/Ivory/Jhabvala/Hopkins/Thompson team that had made Howards End two years before (1991). It was almost the Pinter/Irons/Streep team that had made the French Lieutenant's Woman in 1981, with Mike Nichols directing this time, but other commitments forced Nichols to just a co-producing role. It would be interesting to compare the Pinter and Jhabvala treatments of Kazuo Ishiguro's book. This is Merchant/Ivory in their prime, and it's a sumptuous production that creates the period and milieu (the 30s and 50s in a stately English country house) without falter, and proceeds at a suitably stately pace.There are two parallel developments throughout the film: in the first we see Lord Darlington (James Fox) use his wealth and position to try and soften the resentment that Germany feels over the harsh Treaty of Versailles, only for him to be disillusioned in the end. The second  concerns a romance between two of the servants at the house (Hopkins as Stevens the butler and Thompson as Kenton the housekeeper).Darlington is convinced that more damage has been done since the war than during it, and that the situation will inevitably give rise to another war unless something is done to ameliorate Germany's position. His standards are the old fashioned ones of the English aristocracy: fair play, don't hit a man when he's down, and always act with honour. However he fails to understand that something has already been done to ameliorate the situation, and it's been done by a German, Adolf Hitler. And he believes Hitler. To be fair to Darlington, most of Europe before WWII believed Hitler (even his staunch opponent Winston Churchill was once a fan). At one point Darlington, who is a very kindly man, dismisses two Jewish refugees whom he has employed, simply because they are Jews. But it bothers him, and from that point of the film onwards, he begins to realise his mistake. During and after the war Darlington is hated as a Nazi sympathiser and collaborator, and it breaks him.Darlington has gone through the same experience as Prince Salina in The Leopard.  What we are seeing here is the values of one generation replacing those of another. Darlington's tragedy is that he has outlived his time. His values are sneered at, his position is no longer unquestioned. He doesn't know what to do when dealing with those who don't share his standards and culture. In a sense, worthy as he is, he's a dinosaur. It's a smaller age, when working men decide policy they know nothing about by voting in a general election, where the very people he is trying to aid treat him with contempt as a dupe (""we call them concentration camps, you call them prisons, but it's much the same"").The butler Stevens is a staunch defender of English class values of the period.  He has built his life on the ideal of service, and as a more democratic age dawns, he has difficulty adapting to it. Stevens knows that order and dignity must prevail, that he has what amounts to a small army under his command, each of whom must know his duty and his place for the whole machine to function.  Stevens' ally in this formidable task is Miss Kenton the housekeeper. From this alliance of two capable people flows the love story which is the second plot strand of the film.Slowly Stevens loses faith in Darlington, the pivot of his order. Several times he denies knowing him. He sees the great house and its army of servants dismantled. New, more egalitarian times bring a new owner and a new master (in the film the American millionaire Lewis). Yet throughout Stevens keeps his feelings to himself. He is no more expressive. It is Kenton who makes all the moves in their romance. Stevens remains the passive subject of her decisions.Now here is a difficult matter. Throughout the film we see Stevens tormented again and again at his inability to express his emotions (and a superb job of acting by Hopkins). We never know why.  There is no indication in the film that Stevens considers his ideal of service as more important, or a substitute, for his emotional life (we are told his father worked as a butler, and yet he married). There are moments when the frustrations of both Stevens and Kenton are treated humorously by the film makers.The motivation given for both Stevens and Darlington indicates a structural flaw in the film, its one weakness. We are given no clue for Stevens' silence about his feelings. And we are expected to feel it a weakness of Darlington to attempt to appease Hitler. But it is historically unlikely for him not to do so. At the time of Darlington's meetings Hitler was the elected Chancellor of Germany, not the Fuhrer. He hadn't put anyone in a concentration camp. He had published Mein Kampf in which he expressed incoherent theories about race that not many could understand (even, it is said, Hitler himself). He had made demands to take over part of Czechoslovakia to which Germany had a plausible right. He was shaping up as a strong man of Europe; many politicians were relieved to see him successful. It was a time when 'totalitarian' had no pejorative meaning.  (There were only two ways to avoid the Hitler regime: a more lenient Treaty of Versailles which would have strengthened democratic government in Germany; or a declaration of war against Germany by America in 1932).The film features some of the best acting in any film, not just from the principals but on the part of virtually every cast member. Merchant/Ivory are strong on casting. They say they build their films around it. Here it works. You won't see the kind of 'expert' acting that draws attention to itself; rather, you unhesitatingly believe every person is who they claim to be. Hopkins and Thompson are wonderful at expressing what each is feeling behind the conventional exchanges they manage to have. The set, the great house (houses, the film makers say) is perfectly convincing. The period detail is expertly done. One finds out more about how a great house was run in those days than you could ever expect to know  (as one did about painting in The Girl with the Pearl Earring). Structurally, however, the parallel set up by Ishiguro concerning Darlington and Stevens and their inability to change with the times is not maintained and there is a mystery about Stevens' reticence about his feelings which stop his story from being the tragic one it might be.",5,The solace of memories,1136160000,"01 2, 2006",2006,6576,"['Memories', 'good', 'bad', 'light', 'up', 'what', 'yet',

The film does so with great admiration and respect for it's hard working characters, and gives us much detail about the work they do, and we really understand not only the importance of the behind the scenes work they do, but also that these people have desires, dreams, and feelings. Sir Anthony Hopkins turns in a remarkable performance as the dedicated Butler of a huge English estate. He follows this tradition with great faithfulness, following in his father's footsteps. This is all he has ever known as a source of employment. But this lifestyle forces him to abandon all of his dreams and to bottle up his most cherished emotions and desires. Emma Thompson plays a woman on the staff that attempts to find ways to get into his heart and she wants to see the depth of his soul, which he guards with extreme privacy. She soon grows very fond of him, but because of his extreme traditional commitments and the fact that he has closed much of the best aspects of life out, can he see or even understand her feelings for him?

It covers the time period from the late 1930's to the early 1950's.  Anthony Hopkins is so perfect as the butler.  He evokes a repressed air about him and a sense of strict duty from which he will not waiver.  I suspect that it's probably how many servants both before and during that time period functioned.  The film evokes that time period beautifully.  The electricity between Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson is palatable.  If you enjoy Downton Abbey, you will love this movie for its alternate look at people who are in service.  I only gave it 4 starts because the sound is terrible on this DVD!  I had to put the volume on maximum to hear the actors speak, yet when any of the soundtrack played during the movie, it was SO LOUD.  It's like the sound editor didn't adjust the voices vs. music.

Lord Darlington seems to have an interest in Germany's success due to a conversation he once had with a friend. He feels his honor has been compromised and seems to be unwillingly contributing to evil with good intentions.Stevens serves him with a blind devotion, never questioning his employer's thoughts or even trying to pay attention to the conversations he has with influential politicians.The story begins with Mr. Stevens seeking to undo a mistake from his past, yet I'm not sure he ever really evolves into a fully functioning human being even after he tries to remedy what he ignored.He seems lost as an individual and feels more at home in the position of service. He has captured the essence of service at the expense of his heart and soul. He seems to come to a realization of missed opportunities to influence history in a positive way. He focuses more on daily life and life outside his home environment is foreign to him.Perhaps he feels he is not in a position to change the outside world and focuses on controlling his own small territory. How many of us really have the power to change the course of history?As Mr. Stevens drives to find Miss Kenton, the story unfolds in letters and memories. We see a professional relationship that suffers from a lack of naked honesty and repressed emotions.In one scene/memory, Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson as the head housekeeper) could not have made her wishes any more clear in a moment when she begs Stevens (Anthony Hopkins) to show her the book he is reading. Perhaps her frustration at not being able to ""read"" his thoughts causes her to take action in a physical manner as she tries to force Stevens to give her the book.What a spectacular moment in this movie where Stevens has the chance to break from his repression and plant a delicious kiss on Miss Kenton's lips. And there he stands letting her take the book and devouring her with his eyes. As if he is locked within himself in a cage of protection. It is one of the most heartbreaking emotional moments I've ever seen on screen. The chemistry between Kenton and Stevens is at times like a calm intensity surging to the surface of a lake, but held back by a sheet of ice.A rich tapestry of emotions with a distinct warning: ""Pay attention to your life and to your world or you may have to live in the world you didn't create.""Strange really, because a lot of the time we are warned about the world we do create. In this movie, Stevens seems to withdraw from the decision making process altogether and while this lack of making his own decisions for happiness still ""creates"" his life, we get the sense that he is not really in control of his own destiny because he has negated his responsibility to himself and by trying to escape pain, he has denied himself pleasure.Intense and frustrating for the characters,yet enjoyable to analyze and view.~The Rebecca Review",5,Unfulfilled Dreams and Unspoken Desires,1043020800,"01 20, 2003",2003,3137,"['do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'man', 'can', 'consider', 'fully', 'content', 'done', 'can', 'be', 'service', 'employer', 'StevensStevens', 'butler', 'employment', 'misguided', 'English', 'Aristocrat', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'James', 'Fox', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'have', 'interest', 'Germany', 'success', 'due', 'conversation', 'once', 'had', 'friend', 'honor', 'been', 'compromised', 'be', 'unwillingly', 'contributing', 'evil', 'good', 'intentions.Stevens', 'blind', 'devotion', 'never', 'questioning', 'employer', 'thoughts', 'even', 'trying', 'pay', 'attention', 'conversations', 'influential', 'politicians.The', 'story', 'Mr.', 'Stevens', 'seeking', 'undo', 'mistake', 'past', 'yet', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'ever', 'really', 'fully', 'functioning', 'human', 'being', 'even', 'remedy', 'what', 'lost', 'individual', 'feels', 'more', 'home', 'position', 'service', 'captured', 'essence', 'service', 'expense', 'heart', 'soul', 'come', 'realization', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'influence', 'history', 'positive', 'way', 'more', 'daily', 'life', 'life', 'home', 'environment', 'foreign', 'him.Perhaps', 'feels', 'not', 'position', 'change', 'outside', 'world', 'focuses', 'controlling', 'own', 'small', 'territory', 'How', 'many', 'really', 'have', 'power', 'change', 'course', 'history', 'Mr.', 'Stevens', 'find', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'story', 'unfolds', 'letters', 'memories', 'see', 'professional', 'relationship', 'lack', 'naked', 'honesty', 'repressed', 'emotions.In', 'one', 'scene/memory', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'head', 'housekeeper', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'made', 'wishes', 'more', 'clear', 'moment', 'when', 'Stevens', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'show', 'book', 'reading', 'Perhaps', 'frustration', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'read', 'thoughts', 'take', 'action', 'physical', 'manner', 'force', 'Stevens', 'give', 'book.What', 'spectacular', 'moment', 'movie', 'where', 'Stevens', 'chance', 'break', 'repression', 'plant', 'delicious', 'kiss', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'lips', 'letting', 'take', 'book', 'devouring', 'eyes', 'locked', 'cage', 'protection', 'one', 'most', 'heartbreaking', 'emotional', 'moments', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'Kenton', 'Stevens', 'times', 'calm', 'intensity', 'surging', 'surface', 'lake', 'held', 'back', 'sheet', 'ice.A', 'rich', 'tapestry', 'emotions', 'distinct', 'warning', 'Pay', 'attention', 'life', 'world', 'may', 'have', 'live', 'world', 'did', ""n't"", 'create', 'Strange', 'really', 'lot', 'time', 'are', 'warned', 'world', 'do', 'create', 'movie', 'Stevens', 'withdraw', 'decision', 'making', 'process', 'altogether', 'lack', 'making', 'own', 'decisions', 'happiness', 'still', 'creates', 'life', 'get', 'sense', 'not', 'really', 'control', 'own', 'destiny', 'negated', 'responsibility', 'trying', 'escape', 'pain', 'denied', 'pleasure.Intense', 'frustrating', 'characters', 'yet', 'enjoyable', 'analyze', 'view.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A
7268,A2U0ABMZK6XBVF,0767802802,"Richard A. Tucker ""Tucker at large""","[5, 6]","I've finally bought this film on DVD and after only my second second viewing, the first being back in '94 on video, this film still captures a period in England before the second World War when nobles propped up their idiocy by assuming they knew what was best for all. Their deeds were their much welcomed downfall. It's sometimes too easy to sympathize with them and their glorious lives with the best of food, lodging, decor and other trappings and traditions laced with refinement, but their need to retain it by working in misguided and criminal collusion with the Nazis was deplorable. To be fair few of the countries dragged into the war acted with any sense of real responsibility. Germany's war debt for their part in the WWI was absurdly high, impossible for them to pay.Many would argue that so I'll move on.The way this film exudes with that sense of inevitable transition even in the cloistered and sheltered halls of the Darlington estate is the true charm of this film. Anthony Hopkin's portrayal of the professionally restrained gentleman's gentleman is the perfect study of how driven ideals will bring about the worst results for that individual. He's glib, petty, and at times seemingly heartless, that is, until you see him use some odd but small tic when you realize there's a man under that granite resolve. Even his seemingly trite denial and glib attitude toward some of the other servants is exposed as a defense mechanism. He even exposes himself in some moments when he clearly has not considered the best course of action to take like his initial reaction to his father's grave situation and that moment in his quarters with the persistent Miss Kenton (played incredibly by Emma Thompson) wanting to know what he's reading. That moment is so tense with promise, with hope that his armor will fall, but he plays it too coy, too masterfully as if to shame her even while regretting it, and yet not acknowledging it. He draws her in on purpose only to allow the moment's promise to fail him. That scene always makes me want to rattle his cage.I could go on but all I want to say is everyone in this film delivers better than just fine performances. It's history and drama at it's best. As Mr. Steven's life unfolds, so do the small chinks in his armor. They may never become large, life changing kinks, but they are there and for anyone watching closely enough they reveal a man very much straining to hold himself together for reasons no longer clear even to him.",5,"ah, the traditions of old, such wonderful chinks in the armor",1199059200,"12 31, 2007",2007,2489,"[""'ve"", 'finally', 'bought', 'film', 'DVD', 'only', 'second', 'second', 'viewing', 'first', 'being', 'back', ""'94"", 'video', 'film', 'still', 'period', 'England', 'second', 'World', 'War', 'when', 'nobles', 'propped', 'up', 'idiocy', 'assuming', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'best', 'deeds', 'were', 'much', 'welcomed', 'downfall', 'sometimes', 'too', 'easy', 'sympathize', 'glorious', 'lives', 'best', 'food', 'lodging', 'decor', 'other', 'trappings', 'traditions', 'laced', 'refinement', 'need', 'retain', 'working', 'misguided', 'criminal', 'collusion', 'Nazis', 'was', 'deplorable', 'be', 'fair', 'few', 'countries', 'dragged', 'war', 'acted', 'sense', 'real', 'responsibility', 'Germany', 'war', 'debt', 'part', 'WWI', 'was', 'absurdly', 'high', 'impossible', 'pay.Many', 'would', 'argue', 'so', ""'ll"", 'move', 'on.The', 'way', 'film', 'sense', 'inevitable', 'transition', 'even', 'cloistered', 'sheltered', 'halls', 'Darlington', 'estate', 'true', 'charm', 'film', 'Anthony', 'Hopkin', 'portrayal', 'professionally', 'restrained', 'gentleman', 'gentleman', 'perfect', 'study', 'how', 'driven', 'ideals', 'will', 'bring', 'worst', 'results', 'individual', 'glib', 'petty', 'times', 'seemingly', 'heartless', 'see', 'use', 'odd', 'small', 'tic', 'when', 'realize', 'man', 'granite', 'resolve', 'Even', 'seemingly', 'trite', 'denial', 'glib', 'attitude', 'other', 'servants', 'exposed', 'defense', 'mechanism', 'even', 'moments', 'when', 'clearly', 'not', 'considered', 'best', 'course', 'action', 'take', 'initial', 'reaction', 'father', 'grave', 'situation', 'moment', 'quarters', 'persistent', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'played', 'incredibly', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'reading', 'moment', 'so', 'tense', 'promise', 'hope', 'armor', 'will', 'fall', 'too', 'coy', 'too', 'masterfully', 'shame', 'even', 'regretting', 'yet', 'not', 'acknowledging', 'purpose', 'only', 'allow', 'moment', 'promise', 'fail', 'scene', 'always', 'want', 'rattle', 'cage.I', 'could', 'go', 'want', 'say', 'everyone', 'film', 'better', 'just', 'fine', 'performances', 'history', 'drama', 'best', 'Mr.', 'Steven', 'life', 'unfolds', 'so', 'do', 'small', 'chinks', 'armor', 'may', 'never', 'become', 'large', 'life', 'changing', 'kinks', 'are', 'there', 'anyone', 'watching', 'closely', 'reveal', 'man', 'very', 'much', 'straining', 'hold', 'together', 'reasons', 'no', 'longer', 'clear', 'even']",N/A

Anthony Hopkins takes on the challenge of playing a man who is emotionally repressed and self-effacing, a butler who has complete, blind faith in his master and thinks only to serve him.  Hopkins is such a gifted actor that he can slip into the role seamlessly while still suggesting - so long as you watch closely - private emotions in this restrained and stilted figure.  These emotions are often not fully understood by his character or dealt with properly, but Hopkins puts them there - they might be revealed in a gesture of the hand, a jaw unhinging slightly, eyes lingering more than is strictly necessary.  Hopkins is simply fascinating to watch.He plays the butler Stevens, who in the years leading up to WWII serves Lord Darlington in a grand English country house.  Stevens is loyal to his master; he never questions him, never eavesdrops on his conversations, and assumes that his master has a great and complete understanding of the word.  Lord Darlington, however, turns out to be a Nazi appeaser; he wishes to play it safe and make a deal with Germany rather than go to war.  He holds a gathering of like-minded noblemen and high officials in his house, where only one American politician, Lewis (Christopher Reeve), contradicts him and his policies of appeasement.  When Darlington asks Stevens to remove two housemaids who are Jewish refugees, Stevens does so with some confusion but without argument.  After all, his master understands more than he.  He has to attend to the guests at the gathering, deal with his elderly father, an underbutler, who is growing too old for his duties, and handle the housekeeper, Miss Kenton, who has no problem contradicting Stevens and disturbing what little private time he sets aside each day for himself.Emma Thompson plays Miss Kenton with honesty, intelligence, and vitality.  The conversations between Kenton and Stevens often seem to be in some kind of code - on the surface they speak of housekeeping matters, or perhaps that sentimental book that Stevens reads in private and attempts to conceal...  but matters of greater urgency are touched upon.  Stevens is affected by Kenton, but seems immoveable as stone; he has sacrificed too much of himself to his service, and he is couched in duty and routine.  He can easily see if a single spoon is missing from the dinner table, but cannot put words to his emotions, such as they are.  Would it ever be possible for him to change? Just as Darlington's loyalties were grossly misplaced and repented too late, perhaps Stevens will also find himself only with regrets.Remains of the Day is a fine, moving, nuanced picture, with rich performances.",5,Deep and moving,1140998400,"02 27, 2006",2006,2709,"['Remains', 'Day', 'viewer', 'be', 'observant', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'challenge', 'playing', 'man', 'who', 'emotionally', 'repressed', 'self-effacing', 'butler', 'who', 'complete', 'blind', 'faith', 'master', 'only', 'serve', 'Hopkins', 'such', 'gifted', 'actor', 'can', 'slip', 'role', 'seamlessly', 'still', 'suggesting', 'so', 'long', 'watch', 'closely', 'private', 'emotions', 'restrained', 'stilted', 'figure', 'emotions', 'are', 'often', 'not', 'fully', 'understood', 'character', 'dealt', 'properly', 'Hopkins', 'might', 'be', 'revealed', 'gesture', 'hand', 'jaw', 'unhinging', 'slightly', 'eyes', 'lingering', 'more', 'strictly', 'necessary', 'Hopkins', 'simply', 'fascinating', 'watch.He', 'plays', 'butler', 'Stevens', 'who', 'years', 'leading', 'up', 'WWII', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'grand', 'English', 'country', 'house', 'Stevens', 'loyal', 'master', 'never', 'questions', 'never', 'conversations', 'master', 'great', 'complete', 'understanding', 'word', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'however', 'out', 'be', 'Nazi', 'appeaser', 'play', 'safe', 'make', 'deal', 'Germany', 'rather', 'go', 'war', 'gathering', 'like-minded', 'noblemen', 'high', 'officials', 'house', 'where', 'only', 'one', 'American', 'politician', 'Lewis', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'policies', 'appeasement', 'When', 'Darlington', 'Stevens', 'remove', 'two', 'housemaids', 'who', 'are', 'Jewish', 'refugees', 'Stevens', 'so', 'confusion', 'argument', 'master', 'more', 'attend', 'guests', 'gathering', 'deal', 'elderly', 'father', 'underbutler', 'who', 'growing', 'too', 'old', 'duties', 'handle', 'housekeeper', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'who', 'problem', 'contradicting', 'Stevens', 'disturbing', 'what', 'little', 'private', 'time', 'aside', 'day', 'himself.Emma', 'Thompson', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'honesty', 'intelligence', 'vitality', 'conversations', 'Kenton', 'Stevens', 'often', 'seem', 'be', 'kind', 'code', 'surface', 'speak', 'housekeeping', 'matters', 'perhaps', 'sentimental', 'book', 'reads', 'private', 'attempts', 'conceal', 'matters', 'greater', 'urgency', 'are', 'touched', 'Stevens', 'affected', 'Kenton', 'immoveable', 'stone', 'sacrificed', 'too', 'much', 'service', 'couched', 'duty', 'routine', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'single', 'spoon', 'missing', 'dinner', 'table', 'can', 'not', 'put', 'words', 'emotions', 'such', 'are', 'ever', 'be', 'possible', 'change', 'Just', 'Darlington', 'loyalties', 'were', 'grossly', 'misplaced', 'repented', 'too', 'late', 'perhaps', 'Stevens', 'will', 'also', 'find', 'only', 'regrets.Remains', 'Day', 'fine', 'moving', 'nuanced', 'picture', 'rich', 'performances']",N/A

I was also somewhat surprised to see an early Hugh Grant and a young Ben Chaplin -- both before they became famous, and you can see why they got where they are today.Each and every screen of the movie is riveting, and all characters play their parts impeccably. With the possible exception perhaps of Christopher Reeves' character -- the brazen, world-saving American who calls other European topdog politicians &quot;amateurs.&quot; Yet, thats a minor gripe, and entirely overshadowed by Anthony Hopkins who so subtly reveals all the feelings that his character works so hard to repress that the pain is almost palpable.There is also a nuanced romantic subplot, nothing is ever shown in somatic expressions of hugging and kissing, yet the tension between Hopkins and Thomson is one of the most memorable you will ever see. Unrequited love, was it?The average moviegoer might find the film slow, but anyone interested in watching great actors excelling at their craft will be mesmerized!Highly recommended!",5,THE WHAT-IFs OF LIFE THAT YOU SIMPLY &quot;ACCEPTED&quot;,1070064000,"11 29, 2003",2003,1706,"['Merchant', 'Ivory', 'masterpiece', 'must-own', 'DVD', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'intrigued', 'labyrinthine', 'world', 'English', 'genteel', 'lifestyles', 'butlers', 'under-butlers', 'footmen', 'like', 'splendid', 'British', 'dialogue', 'fancy', 'understated', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'still', 'emotion', 'circumspection', 'comparable', 'provoked', 'written', 'word.Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'play', 'dignified', 'servants', 'manor', 'walls', 'quot', 'great', 'affairs', 'world', 'are', 'decided.', 'quot', 'had', 'clutches', 'very', 'outset', 'set', 'backdrop', 'English', 'countryside', 'exquisitely', 'complimented', 'music', 'Richard', 'Robbins', 'never', 'let', 'go', 'was', 'also', 'somewhat', 'surprised', 'see', 'early', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'young', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'became', 'famous', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'got', 'where', 'are', 'today.Each', 'screen', 'movie', 'riveting', 'characters', 'play', 'parts', 'impeccably', 'possible', 'exception', 'perhaps', 'Christopher', 'Reeves', 'character', 'brazen', 'world-saving', 'American', 'who', 'other', 'European', 'topdog', 'politicians', 'quot', 'quot', 'minor', 'gripe', 'entirely', 'overshadowed', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'who', 'so', 'subtly', 'feelings', 'character', 'so', 'hard', 'repress', 'pain', 'almost', 'palpable.There', 'also', 'nuanced', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'nothing', 'ever', 'shown', 'somatic', 'expressions', 'hugging', 'kissing', 'tension', 'Hopkins', 'Thomson', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'Unrequited', 'love', 'was', 'average', 'moviegoer', 'might', 'find', 'film', 'slow', 'anyone', 'interested', 'watching', 'great', 'actors', 'excelling', 'craft', 'will', 'be', 'mesmerized', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

7280,A3IG10D35UYT9F,0767802802,Starfire,"[8, 9]","Oh my, where to start? I only recently saw this film due to a mild enamorment with the lovely Emma Thompson and boy am I glad I did. Being fairly unfamiliar with Merchant and Ivory productions, I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of research that must've gone in to the producing of this film. The sets are just enormously fabulous, with rich colors and impeccable detail.Anthony Hopkins, whom I had only know previously as Hannibal Lector, surprised me with his quinessentially British-butler demeanor. He gives an appropriately sedated yet emotional performance, one quite worthy of an Oscar. Ms. Thompson plays his 'love interest' (though they don't even share a kiss) and is a fiery, free-spirited woman who was slightly wronged by Mr. Stevens due to his inattention towards her.To those who have read the book, I am pleased to say that this film is a very close adaptation of it. Though seemingly unfilmable, Kazuo Ishiguro's Booker Prize-winning novel is manifested magnificently on the screen. A very touching scene that I regretted not being in the film (but is included in the deleted scenes on this DVD) is the moment that Mrs. Benn reflects aloud about the life she might've led with Mr. Stevens. In the book, Stevens thinks to himself, ""Why hide it, my heart was breaking."" Such a poignant line and one that really embodies the values at the core of the film. The book is written more comedically while the film's tone is more somber.I particularly enjoyed Emma Thompson's performance in this film. She had just won an Oscar for Howards End (another film I recommend highly) and here she is once again paired with Anthony Hopkins and Merchant Ivory. The infamous 'Book scene' had me tearing my hair out (figuratively) in frustration at Stevens' narrow-minded pursuit of service and 'dignity'. At the end, however, I was crying with him in agony at the thought of his wasted years and his wasted love for Ms. Kenton.So, folks, the moral of the story is to'Not waste your life!' and to watch this movie.Highly recommended: 5/5This DVD contains several informative 'Making-of' specials and a very funny commentary track with Thompson, the director, and the producer.",5,Breath-taking and elegant,1140825600,"02 25, 2006",2006,2180,"['Oh', 'where', 'start', 'only', 'recently', 'saw', 'film', 'due', 'mild', 'enamorment', 'lovely', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'boy', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'Being', 'fairly', 'unfamiliar', 'Merchant', 'Ivory', 'productions', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'amount', 'research', 'must', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'producing', 'film', 'sets', 'are', 'just', 'enormously', 'fabulous', 'rich', 'colors', 'impeccable', 'detail.Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'whom', 'had', 'only', 'know', 'previously', 'Hannibal', 'Lector', 'surprised', 'quinessentially', 'British-butler', 'demeanor', 'appropriately', 'sedated', 'yet', 'emotional', 'performance', 'one', 'quite', 'worthy', 'Oscar', 'Ms.', 'Thompson', ""'love"", 'interest', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'share', 'kiss', 'fiery', 'free-spirited', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'slightly', 'wronged', 'Mr.', 'Stevens', 'due', 'inattention', 'towards', 'her.To', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'am', 'pleased', 'say', 'film', 'very', 'close', 'adaptation', 'seemingly', 'unfilmable', 'Kazuo', 'Ishiguro', 'Booker', 'Prize-winning', 'novel', 'manifested', 'magnificently', 'screen', 'very', 'touching', 'scene', 'regretted', 'not', 'being', 'film', 'included', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'moment', 'Mrs.', 'Benn', 'aloud', 'life', 'might', ""'ve"", 'led', 'Mr.', 'Stevens', 'book', 'Stevens', 'Why', 'hide', 'heart', 'was', 'breaking', 'Such', 'poignant', 'line', 'one', 'really', 'values', 'core', 'film', 'book', 'written', 'more', 'comedically', 'film', 'tone', 'more', 'somber.I', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'performance', 'film', 'had', 'just', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Howards', 'End', 'film', 'recommend', 'highly', 'here', 'once', 'again', 'paired', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Merchant', 'Ivory', 'infamous', 'scene', 'had', 'tearing', 'hair', 'figuratively', 'frustration', 'Stevens', 'narrow-minded', 'pursuit', 'service', ""'dignity"", 'end', 'however', 'was', 'crying', 'agony', 'thought', 'wasted', 'years', 'wasted', 'love', 'Ms.', 'Kenton.So', 'folks', 'moral', 'story', ""to'Not"", 'life', 'watch', 'movie.Highly', 'recommended', '5/5This', 'DVD', 'contains', 'several', 'informative', ""'Making-of"", 'specials', 'very', 'funny', 'commentary', 'track', 'Thompson', 'director', 'producer']",N/A

They could not tell it then and it was already late to do so when they met the one last time. One gets the feeling that they would have had a happier life if they have done so when what prevented them at the time was a deep love for his work on Mr Steven's behalf and maybe a womanly pride on Miss Kenton's behalf. Maybe also her love for her work. I felt she was maybe getting revenge while marrying another man in front of the eyes of the man she loves, or urging Mr. Stevens to open his feelings.

7284,A3FS3FJPD3RJTD,0767802802,"Sunday ""SundayAtDusk""","[4, 9]","This is one of my absolute favorite movies.  I've viewed it probably at least 10 times, a rarity for me.  My advice to anyone who has not seen it, is to judge this movie for yourself. Do not allow yourself to be swayed by anything written or said about this movie--especially not anything written or said by those who made it.This movie is quite the paradox...in the sense it is a highly intelligent well-made movie...yet, from the get-go, those associated with it or reviewed it all seemed to see it in the same flawed, not to mention stereotypic way.  Anthony Hopkin's butler character Stevens is ""the perfect English butler--an ideal carried by him to fanatical lengths""...he is ""suppressed""...he made the horrid mistake of not marrying Miss Kenton, the housekeeper...if ONLY he had married Miss Kenton, they would have lived happily ever after!!!!! :)Seriously, it is as if no one ever considered, or even is ALLOWED to consider, that if Stevens had married Miss Kenton, he might have stayed the same way he was after the marriage that he was before the marriage; at which time, the little things that irked her about Mr. Stevens before they married, might have become big things that irked her; and she might have become a bitter woman, regretted marrying him, and might have been on her way to visit Mr. Benn, the man who asked her to marry him first.  Was it not actually Emma Thompson's character, Miss Kenton, who actually made the big mistake of marrying someone she did not love? What if instead of labeling Stevens ""suppressed"", he was labeled a ""workaholic""?  Would everyone then assume they would have lived happily ever after if they had married? Probably not.From the first time I saw the movie, I personally felt Stevens was more steroetyped than suppressed.  My beliefs of that were enforced when I got the press kit, and read the following: ""None of the filmmakers had any experience with the way a great English country house is run, or the minutiae of a butler's life. Ishiguro himself is the first to admit this, and had to learn about it in the course of writing his novel."" Then there was the following from the DVD insertion: ""None of us knew anything at all about what a butler does, including Ishiguro, who told Ruth Prawer Jhabvala when they'd met that he'd gotten it all out of a book, or had simply made it up"".One can probably rightfully question that novelist Ishiguro ever actually learned it, and can probably easily believe he ""simply made it up"".  Listening to him discuss the movie in the DVD special feature leaves one wondering if he actually had any real interest--or more importantly, any real RESPECT--for his main character Stevens, the butler.  He seems unable to focus on much of anything but the political situation, and Steven's failure to grasp the horror of Nazism.  My, you think if you're running a household with an ""army"" of servants, you might not have the time to think much about politics?  Really, it's laugable to listen to someone such as Ishiguro, whohas the time and money to think, to write, to reflect--in hindsight, no less--to judge a working class man who did not have such luxuries! What he is doing is no different than what the pompous friend of Lord Darlington's did when he started questioning Steven's about his political beliefs. The jerk friend was trying to show Stevens, as a servant and common man, could not possibly grasp political issues. He was claiming Stevens was not intelligent enough to do so.  What Ishiguro, as well as others involved in the movie, are claiming is that Stevens was not ""man enough"" to do so. What was Stevens suppose to do--at the last meal of the conference, take a platter of food and dump it over the Baroness' blonde head?! Does the word ""sacked"" mean anything to Ishiguro?  Does the word ""starvation""? Obviously not. Obviously, the only ""manly"" and ""intelligent"" thing a servant in that time period could do, according to the movie, is leave service, and no longer be a servant.  Gee, but guess what? Without the servants, there would have been no such households like Darlington Hall...and  there could have been no movie like ""Remains of the Day"", unless it was a ""fantasy"" movie!Also laughable was the way you hardly ever see Stevens controlling the staff...apparently, the filmakers were doing so.  The only way Stevens seemed to control the staff was to try to make sure he didn't hire someone unfit...and to make self-righteous comments about servants running off to marry each other.  Ishiguro might have based his book on a butler's diary, but it was obviously one of those diaries that didn't disclose much about the way the person actually lived.  One imagined it just contained some deep, lofty thoughts about his life...which sounded ridiculous when they were spoken verbatim in the film...which one imagines was the basis for that discussion between him and Mr. Benns in the butler's pantry. Yes, that's probably how butlers talked to each other in private!Anthony Hopkins deserves tremendous credit for pulling off the character of Stevens with all the steretypes he was handed. One can only think it would have been an even better performance, however, if there weren't so many preconceived ideas associated with his character.  He also was the one, according to the press kit, who insisted a professional butler be brought in to show the actual way things would have been done in such a household.  His Stevens is not broken at the end, not destroyed by regrets.  He is simply a man who made his choices in life, may have had regrets like most people do, and then carried on with his life and job. Emma Thompson's Miss Kenton fortunately escaped all the stereotypes dumped on Stevens, and she gave her usual exceptional performance. Hugh Grant also was exceptional, and added a bit of much appreciated humor to the movie.Then, there was James Fox's character of Lord Darlington...once again, judge for yourself how you feel about this character...others will tell you all sorts of ways to view him and judge him.  I personally thought his character was the TRUE outstanding one in the movie.  One wonders if a ""real"" Lord Darlington would have been so sweet and ""naive"", especially after serving in World War I...but Fox pulls it off. It's a shame the movie didn't focus a bit more on him, and less on the relationship between Mr. Stevens and Miss Kenton. I'll always see ""Remains of the Day"" more as a James Fox movie, than an Anthony Hopkins/Emma Thompson one.Final word about how to view this movie...if you are not a big fan of widescreen and know a lot about it, I would not waste my money on the DVD.  View the movie on VHS. I have a normal 20 inch TV, and the DVD version of this movie is not watchable on my TV.  The black lines on the top and the bottom of the screen are so big, it's like watching the VHS version of the movie, with at least a third of the picture blacked out!  It totally destroys the movie, in my opinion. But once again, you need to be the judge of that.  Just like you need to be the one and only judge of this outstanding British movie.",5,Judge This Outstanding Movie For Yourself!,1113091200,"04 10, 2005",2005,7094,"['one', 'absolute', 'favorite',

7288,A30OXD42ZFYZLO,0767802802,Thomas Keneally,"[3, 3]","I have read the Booker prize winning book by Ishiguro and it blew me away. It is a special book that shows the life of a person who sacrifices everything for his master. I was sure that the movie will not live upto my expectations as a lot of it is in the mind of Steven, the butler. However, the movie did do a impressive job of it. It is one of the best directed by James Ivory and has a great cast, Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson, James Fox, Chistopher Reeve and Hugh Grant, all of whom give outstanding performances. This movie was put together beautifully and shows the life of a person, Lord Darlington who is sympathetic to the Germans after WW1 for their bad treatment. It shows how naive he is in understanding the change happening in Europe and Germany, especially. It also shows how a number of people subscribe to his view and class distinctions then. The part where they discredit democracy by showing how little the butler knows of the world and yet he decides who should govern the country is nasty, but well done. Christopher Reeve does a good job of showing how they are amateur in their thinking and how politics must be left to professionals. James Fox does a good job as the Lord Darlington, who is simple minded, does mistakes and realizes later. Hugh Grant comes in an unusual role as his grandson and pointing out the problems in Germany. Though there is not much humor in the movie, the few pieces are well done.Anthony Hopkins plays the role of the butler very well and deserves praise for being the person totally dedicated to his job and employer. This leads to his coldness and distant behavior. His first meeting with Emma Thompson, as Miss Kenton, is a special occasion and it shows how he is in love with her, but unable to show it for multiple reasons. Their relationship is very touching, both during the good and bad parts. It eventually leads them to separation. When she tries to reason with him on a number of occasions, he accepts her rationale at times and not at others. He is single minded in his dedication to his job, however distasteful it is, though she is more pragmatic and works with conscience. Between the two, they carry the movie through. It is not an easy story to be cast into a movie, but the two do an impressive job and must be congratulated for that. This is a movie of love that is not consummated and is wonderfully portrayed. It is one of the best Merchant-Ivory movies and should not be missed for the thoughtful direction, great acting and good screenplay. It is well directed with time change between 1930s and 1960s. The DVD transfer is also very good. The only complaint is that in the end when one can see the torture in the face of Stevens, it does not fully show the thoughts going on in him when he sees that he is losing Miss Kenton.",5,Movie is great though different from the book,1132012800,"11 15, 2005",2005,2804,"['have', 'read', 'Booker', 'prize', 'winning', 'book', 'Ishiguro', 'blew', 'away', 'special', 'book', 'life', 'person', 'who', 'everything', 'master', 'was', 'sure', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'live', 'upto', 'expectations', 'lot', 'mind', 'Steven', 'butler', 'However', 'movie', 'did', 'do', 'impressive', 'job', 'one', 'best', 'directed', 'James', 'Ivory', 'great', 'cast', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'James', 'Fox', 'Chistopher', 'Reeve', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'whom', 'give', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'movie', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'beautifully', 'life', 'person', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'who', 'sympathetic', 'Germans', 'WW1', 'bad', 'treatment', 'how', 'naive', 'understanding', 'change', 'happening', 'Europe', 'Germany', 'especially', 'also', 'how', 'number', 'people', 'subscribe', 'view', 'class', 'distinctions', 'then', 'part', 'where', 'discredit', 'democracy', 'showing', 'how', 'little', 'butler', 'world', 'yet', 'who', 'should', 'govern', 'country', 'nasty', 'well', 'done', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'are', 'amateur', 'thinking', 'how', 'politics', 'must', 'be', 'left', 'professionals', 'James', 'Fox', 'good', 'job', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'who', 'simple', 'minded', 'mistakes', 'later', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'unusual', 'role', 'grandson', 'pointing', 'out', 'problems', 'Germany', 'not', 'much', 'humor', 'movie', 'few', 'pieces', 'are', 'well', 'done.Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'role', 'butler', 'very', 'well', 'praise', 'being', 'person', 'totally', 'dedicated', 'job', 'employer', 'coldness', 'distant', 'behavior', 'first', 'meeting', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Miss', 'Kenton', 'special', 'occasion', 'how', 'love', 'unable', 'show', 'multiple', 'reasons', 'relationship', 'very', 'touching', 'good', 'bad', 'parts', 'eventually', 'separation', 'When', 'reason', 'number', 'occasions', 'rationale', 'times', 'not', 'others', 'single', 'minded', 'dedication', 'job', 'however', 'distasteful', 'more', 'pragmatic', 'conscience', 'two', 'carry', 'movie', 'not', 'easy', 'story', 'be', 'cast', 'movie', 'two', 'do', 'impressive', 'job', 'must', 'be', 'congratulated', 'movie', 'love', 'not', 'consummated', 'wonderfully', 'portrayed', 'one', 'best', 'Merchant-Ivory', 'movies', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'thoughtful', 'direction', 'great', 'acting', 'good', 'screenplay', 'well', 'directed', 'time', 'change', '1930s', '1960s', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'only', 'complaint', 'end', 'when', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'torture', 'face', 'Stevens', 'not', 'fully', 'show', 'thoughts', 'going', 'when', 'losing', 'Miss', 'Kenton']",N/A

Anthony Hopkins gives a performance that is just so unbelievably real that you completely connect with his character from the beginning, even though you're simply yelling at him the whole time.  Emma Thompson, not only the most gorgeous actress alive (save Robia LaMorte), but her subtle gestures and soft yet strong tone intrigues the viewer into falling in love with her character.  No other actors could have pulled off these roles.  The supporting cast also does a terrific job: Christopher Reeve, Hugh Grant, James Fox, and Peter Vaughn are all marvelous as their extremely subtle characters.  That's what this entire film is about--subtlety.  That leads us to the director James Ivory.  Either critically praised to the highest extreme or lambasted as an amateur and a slave to old-fashioned cliches, Ivory has a long and respectable trend of films made with his production partner Ismail Merchant.  In this particular film, Ivory is sure to keep everything minimal.  There are long passages with no dialogue and sometimes even no score.  Everything is hidden from the viewer; from the character's feelings to the workings of Lord Darlington, nothing is fully revealed to us.  That is where this film's beauty lies--within the viewer.  It so strongly urges the viewer to participate and to contemplate and to search and to ask.  Perhaps it's only for those who have experienced torturous relationships, and that's why I like it so much.  All I know is that this film is FLAWLESS.  The music (dark), the acting (shockingly realistic), the cinematography (gloomy), the script (compelling), the direction (suspenseful), the production values (absolutely gorgeous design); every aspect of this film contributes to an overall MASTERPIECE, that may someday get the credit it deserves.",5,"The greatest film of all time, no doubt about it!",1000857600,"09 19, 2001",2001,1902,"[""'re"", 'sick', 'Hollywood', 'pathetic', 'excuses', 'love', 'stories', 'then', 'film', 'you.First', 'actors', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'performance', 'just', 'so', 'unbelievably', 'real', 'completely', 'connect', 'character', 'beginning', 'even', ""'re"", 'simply', 'yelling', 'whole', 'time', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'not', 'only', 'most', 'gorgeous', 'actress', 'alive', 'save', 'Robia', 'LaMorte', 'subtle', 'gestures', 'soft', 'yet', 'strong', 'tone', 'viewer', 'falling', 'love', 'character', 'other', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'roles', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'terrific', 'job', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'James', 'Fox', 'Peter', 'Vaughn', 'are', 'all', 'marvelous', 'extremely', 'subtle', 'characters', 'what', 'entire', 'film', 'about', 'subtlety', 'director', 'James', 'Ivory', 'critically', 'praised', 'highest', 'extreme', 'lambasted', 'amateur', 'slave', 'old-fashioned', 'cliches', 'Ivory', 'long', 'respectable', 'trend', 'films', 'made', 'production', 'partner', 'Ismail', 'Merchant', 'particular', 'film', 'Ivory', 'sure', 'keep', 'everything', 'minimal', 'are', 'long', 'passages', 'dialogue', 'sometimes', 'even', 'score', 'Everything', 'hidden', 'viewer', 'character', 'feelings', 'workings', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'nothing', 'fully', 'revealed', 'where', 'film', 'beauty', 'viewer', 'so', 'strongly', 'viewer', 'participate', 'contemplate', 'search', 'ask', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'who', 'have', 'experienced', 'torturous', 'relationships', 'why', 'like', 'so', 'much', 'know', 'film', 'FLAWLESS', 'music', 'dark', 'acting', 'shockingly', 'realistic', 'cinematography', 'gloomy', 'script', 'compelling', 'direction', 'suspenseful', 'production', 'values', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'design', 'aspect', 'film', 'overall', 'MASTERPIECE', 'may', 'someday', 'get', 'credit']",N/A

Hopkins delivers perfection as a repressed butler and is amazing on so many levels. I marveled at the brilliance of the cast and the story, and its place in a historical context.

One reason is the excellent casting. Sir Anthony Hopkins plays the by-the-book butler whose icy demeanor actually belies a fondness and even love for his efficient and charming housekeeper, played excellently by Emma Thompson. His insistence on decorum and adherence to the politics of the houselhold cause him to refrain from ever proclaiming his true feelings for his housekeeper, and so also goes his chance of personal happiness. Fast forward years later, and the aging Hopkins now has a new master, an American [played by Christopher Reeve]...he has the opportunity of engaging a new housekeeper, and thinks of his old housekeeper...but things are not as easy as he believes...and whether he gets to rectify his past mistakes makes up the rest of the story. A well-told tale of love lost, and also a good movie that provides a glimpse of politics in England during a time when Germany was rising in power.",5,Compelling performances by Hopkins and Thompson,1178841600,"05 11, 2007",2007,1072,"['Kazuo', 'Ishiguro', 'Remains', 'Day', 'was', 'masterpiece', 'yet', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'not', 'only', 'faithful', 'novel', 'opinion', 'book', 'One', 'reason', 'excellent', 'casting', 'Sir', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'by-the-book', 'butler', 'icy', 'demeanor', 'actually', 'fondness', 'even', 'love', 'efficient', 'charming', 'housekeeper', 'played', 'excellently', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'insistence', 'decorum', 'adherence', 'politics', 'houselhold', 'cause', 'refrain', 'ever', 'proclaiming', 'true', 'feelings', 'housekeeper', 'so', 'also', 'chance', 'personal', 'happiness', 'Fast', 'forward', 'years', 'later', 'aging', 'Hopkins', 'now', 'new', 'master', 'American', '[', 'played', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', ']', 'opportunity', 'engaging', 'new', 'housekeeper', 'thinks', 'old', 'housekeeper', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'easy', 'rectify', 'past', 'mistakes', 'up', 'rest', 'story', 'well-told', 'tale', 'love', 'lost', 'also', 'good', 'movie', 'glimpse', 'politics', 'England', 'time', 'when', 'Germany', 'was', 'rising', 'power']",N/A
