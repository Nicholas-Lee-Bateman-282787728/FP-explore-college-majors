A jumbled, incoherent storyline leads to ""Billy Lo"" falling from a helicopter to the ground below, killing him, as we're left to follow his younger brother, Bobby Lo. So not only do we start out following some Bruce Lee clone, the film kills that one off and has us follow another one thirty minutes into the story. The main reason to watch this one is when Bobby Lo fights a lion, which is quite obviously a guy in a lion costume. Jang Lee Hwang is also the villain, who is usually pretty awesome but his screen time is significantly small. Mainly watched this and the original Game of Death because they're a part of the Bruce Lee boxed set. It's no wonder they're included with Lee's finished works.

554098,A3AGZNJMFJ8XUA,B00004W5W7,"Itani Mullik ""Redd""","[1, 1]","Speaking as a die-hard Bruce Lee fan, I share the opinions of those who don't consider Game of Death(the 20th Century FOX version) to be rhe real deal because of all of the doubles, awkward fight scenes and snippets(not to mention the altered storyline and plot), however, having grown to watch the film with an open mind, I think the film was OK(I still feel it would've been better to just feauture the double, change the title, and cut the snippets). Likewise, I consider Game of Death 2 to be a pretty good sequel because it's done in similar fashion, features more unreleased Game of Death footage,continues to follow the character Billy Lo, has better fight sequences, and is actually inspired by Lee's original Game of Death concept(the Death Tower). However, as with the 1st GOD, you may find the snippets and doubling a tad bit irritating...BUT, when watched with an open mind I think that viewers will find that Tong Lung(the REAL star,Bruce Lee double, Bobby Lo) shines in this movie as Lee's character meets an untimely demise and is succeeded by his younger brother(exit Billy Lo,enter Bobby Lo). The only reason I wouldn't score this film above 3 stars is because of the one fight scene in which there was an attempt on Bobby's life in the Palace of Death via what was supposed to be a LION(someone please tell me that it was supposed to be some sort of warrior, fighting off a LION with a chair...get real). Aside from the LION disaster, I have to be a little critical of the fact that they'd attempted sneak in a little ""Enter the Dragon"" setup for the Death Tower(drug trafficking, underground factory,etc). But overall, I feel this is as good a sequel to Game of Death(the 20th Century FOX version) as Bruce Li's Chinese Connection 2 was to Bruce Lee's original.However, only buy this film if you have an open enough mind NOT to be turned off by the doubles and snippets as used in the 1st.",3,Not  BRUCE...but NOT BAD,1093392000,"08 25, 2004",2004,1908,"['Speaking', 'die-hard', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'fan', 'share', 'opinions', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'Game', 'Death', '20th', 'Century', 'FOX', 'version', 'be', 'rhe', 'real', 'deal', 'doubles', 'awkward', 'fight', 'scenes', 'snippets', 'not', 'mention', 'altered', 'storyline', 'plot', 'however', 'having', 'grown', 'watch', 'film', 'open', 'mind', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'OK', 'still', 'feel', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'just', 'feauture', 'double', 'change', 'title', 'cut', 'snippets', 'Likewise', 'consider', 'Game', 'Death', '2', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'sequel', 'done', 'similar', 'fashion', 'more', 'unreleased', 'Game', 'Death', 'footage', 'follow', 'character', 'Billy', 'Lo', 'better', 'fight', 'sequences', 'actually', 'inspired', 'Lee', 'original', 'Game', 'Death', 'concept', 'Death', 'Tower', 'However', '1st', 'GOD', 'may', 'find', 'snippets', 'doubling', 'tad', 'bit', 'irritating', 'BUT', 'when', 'watched', 'open', 'mind', 'think', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'Tong', 'Lung', 'REAL', 'star', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'double', 'Bobby', 'Lo', 'movie', 'Lee', 'character', 'untimely', 'demise', 'succeeded', 'younger', 'brother', 'exit', 'Billy', 'Lo', 'enter', 'Bobby', 'Lo', 'only', 'reason', 'would', ""n't"", 'score', 'film', '3', 'stars', 'one', 'fight', 'scene', 'was', 'attempt', 'Bobby', 'life', 'Palace', 'Death', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'LION', 'someone', 'please', 'tell', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'sort', 'warrior', 'fighting', 'off', 'LION', 'chair', 'get', 'real', 'Aside', 'LION', 'disaster', 'have', 'be', 'little', 'critical', 'fact', ""'d"", 'attempted', 'sneak', 'little', 'Enter', 'Dragon', 'setup', 'Death', 'Tower', 'drug', 'trafficking', 'underground', 'factory', 'etc', 'overall', 'feel', 'as', 'good', 'sequel', 'Game', 'Death', '20th', 'Century', 'FOX', 'version', 'Bruce', 'Li', 'Chinese', 'Connection', '2', 'was', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'original.However', 'only', 'buy', 'film', 'have', 'open', 'enough', 'mind', 'NOT', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'doubles', 'snippets', 'used', '1st']",N/A
554099,A3AFNUPOSK2QGV,B00004W5W7,"Joe Kenney ""buttergun""","[7, 8]","Okay, this one is unusual, due to some very heavy editing.  First of all, I must respectfully point out that the below reviewer isn't talking about this flick, New Game of Death.  He's talking about an entirely different movie: Tower of Death, aka Game of Death 2.  That movie is an indirect sequel to the 1978, Robert Clouse-directed Game of Death.  This movie, however, is something else.  Like most kung-fu movies, it is known by another name: Goodbye Bruce Lee.  But here it has been edited and changed around.  Goodbye Bruce Lee was a psuedo-documentary in which Bruce Li was introduced as the man who would complete Bruce Lee's unfinished movie Game of Death.  There was even a short interview with Kareem Abdul Jabbar at the beginning, as well as some shots of Li working the high-bar, giving us a peek at his acrobatic skills.  Then, mid-course through this documentary, a &quot;movie&quot; began, in which Li fought some crooks and eventually rescues his fiancee, who is held in a martial artist-filled pagoda.  This edit of Goodbye Bruce Lee features all of that, save for the Jabbar interview and the original narration, which have both been removed.  Now it is made to resemble just a regular movie, and not a documentary at all.  However the editing has left it very odd.  For example, it still begins with Li working the high-bar.  But instead of narration explaining who this man is, the theme music (a very Blaxploitation sounding song called &quot;King of Kung Fu&quot;) plays relentlessly, and there is no dialog.  Then Li is taken to a producer's office, where he's told that he's been chosen to complete Bruce Lee's movie Game of Death.  Li agrees, and the producers have him and his girlfriend sit down in a projection room, so they can show him &quot;the portion of the movie that Bruce finished.&quot;  The projectionist starts the movie and from there on we're into the New Game of Death.  There is no more mention of Bruce Li and his girlfriend in the projection room.  Sound confusing?  It is.  As for the movie itself, it's confusing too - and I think this is mostly due to the English dubbing.  Back when this was released, I think US distributors just tried to get the dialog to match the movements of the actors' mouths - they weren't so worried about accurately-translated dialog.  And that really shows in this movie.  Several times it's very obvious that the dialog has nothing to do with what's going on.  And as for the fighting, well it isn't that great.  Bruce Li was no Bruce Lee.  As if you didn't already know that.  There are some saving graces, though: the pagoda guardians are fairly interesting in a campy way, and Li does the best with what he's been given in this film.  Two scenes that had me laughing: Li's brother discovers that his apartment has been trashed as the opening chords of the James Bond theme blast on the soundtrack.  And two, Li walks into his trashed home, steps into a room, and steps back out in the black and yellow tracksuit that the real Bruce Lee wore in his Game of Death.  Anyway, my advice: rent the movie if you want to see it.  Maybe one day the original version, Goodbye Bruce Lee, will be released.",2,A strange one...,986083200,"04 1, 2001",2001,3176,"['Okay', 'one', 'unusual', 'due', 'very', 'heavy', 'editing', 'First', 'must', 'respectfully', 'point', 'out', 'below', 'reviewer', ""n't"", 'talking', 'flick', 'New', 'Game', 'Death', 'talking', 'entirely', 'different', 'movie', 'Tower', 'Death', 'aka', 'Game', 'Death', '2', 'movie', 'indirect', 'sequel', '1978', 'Robert', 'Clouse-directed', 'Game', 'Death', 'movie', 'however', 'something', 'else', 'most', 'kung-fu', 'movies', 'known', 'name', 'Goodbye', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'here', 'been', 'edited', 'changed', 'Goodbye', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'was', 'psuedo-documentary', 'Bruce', 'Li', 'was', 'introduced', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'complete', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'unfinished', 'movie', 'Game', 'Death', 'was', 'even', 'short', 'interview', 'Kareem', 'Abdul', 'Jabbar', 'beginning', 'as', 'well', 'shots', 'Li', 'working', 'high-bar', 'giving', 'peek', 'acrobatic', 'skills', 'Then', 'mid-course', 'documentary', 'quot', 'movie', 'quot', 'began', 'Li', 'fought', 'crooks', 'eventually', 'rescues', 'fiancee', 'who', 'held', 'martial', 'artist-filled', 'pagoda', 'edit', 'Goodbye', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'save', 'Jabbar', 'interview', 'original', 'narration', 'have', 'been', 'removed', 'Now', 'made', 'resemble', 'just', 'regular', 'movie', 'not', 'documentary', 'However', 'editing', 'left', 'very', 'odd', 'example', 'still', 'Li', 'working', 'high-bar', 'instead', 'narration', 'explaining', 'who', 'man', 'theme', 'music', 'very', 'Blaxploitation', 'sounding', 'song', 'called', 'quot', 'King', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'quot', 'relentlessly', 'dialog', 'Then', 'Li', 'taken', 'producer', 'office', 'where', 'told', 'been', 'chosen', 'complete', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'movie', 'Game', 'Death', 'Li', 'producers', 'have', 'girlfriend', 'sit', 'down', 'projection', 'room', 'can', 'show', 'quot', 'portion', 'movie', 'Bruce', 'finished.', 'quot', 'projectionist', 'movie', 'there', ""'re"", 'New', 'Game', 'Death', 'more', 'mention', 'Bruce', 'Li', 'girlfriend', 'projection', 'room', 'confusing', 'movie', 'confusing', 'too', 'think', 'mostly', 'due', 'English', 'dubbing', 'Back', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'think', 'US', 'distributors', 'just', 'tried', 'get', 'dialog', 'match', 'movements', 'actors', 'mouths', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'worried', 'accurately-translated', 'dialog', 'really', 'movie', 'Several', 'times', 'very', 'obvious', 'dialog', 'nothing', 'do', 'what', 'going', 'fighting', 'well', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'Bruce', 'Li', 'was', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'are', 'saving', 'graces', 'pagoda', 'guardians', 'are', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'campy', 'way', 'Li', 'best', 'what', 'been', 'given', 'film', 'Two', 'scenes', 'had', 'laughing', 'Li', 'brother', 'discovers', 'apartment', 'been', 'trashed', 'opening', 'chords', 'James', 'Bond', 'theme', 'blast', 'soundtrack', 'two', 'Li', 'trashed', 'home', 'steps', 'room', 'steps', 'back', 'black', 'yellow', 'tracksuit', 'real', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'wore', 'Game', 'Death', 'Anyway', 'advice', 'rent', 'movie', 'want', 'see', 'Maybe', 'one', 'day', 'original', 'version', 'Goodbye', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'will', 'be', 'released']",N/A

It is a Bruceploitation film (though it is one of the better ones) and it is an exiting revenge flick. Raymond Chow had apparently not made enough money off of the insipid Game of Death and was slowly leaking ""newly found"" footage of Bruce so it was bound that he would create another film with spliced in footage, redubbed dialog and, of course, Bruce's namesake. A lot of people were using Lee's name to promote their own productions, but Golden Harvest (who Bruce worked for; though technically this was a Seasonal production) was the worst of these offenders.The first act of the movie is the least interesting and worst part of the film. Bruce Lee stars (posthumously edited in) as Billy Lo (Bruce Lee) who visits his friend Chin Ku (Hwang Jang Lee) who is currently beating up an under-classed challenger. After an reestablishment of friendship between the two (never a good sign in a Kung Fu film), he visits an abbot (Roy Chiao revisiting his role from Enter the Dragon so they can reuse and redub footage) to discuss about his contumacious brother Bobby Lo (Tong Lung who also starred in Game of Death).Of course, the scenes that compromise the first act are not only exploitative of Bruce Lee they are also poorly done. The most obvious is that the backgrounds do not match between Bruce's footage and the new footage. Also check out the sculpted back muscles of Bruce and compare them to his double. It is not even close. The fight scenes with Bruce (and his double) do not flow well. However, anytime you see a fight scene and that Bruce (or his double) does a difficult move such as a flip you will notice that it is the incomparable Yuen Biao (he even has a small role toward the beginning.)Bruce later visits the funeral of his friend Chin Ku and he is prevented from examining the body (this must mean something to the plot.) When the ceremony takes place a helicopter comes by and snags the coffin. For some strange reason, well to dispose of the fake Bruce character, he jumps on the coffin as it is flying away and is hit with a dart and falls to his death. This is absolutely absurd. Though this is not as bad as the 70s clothes at the funeral or the tacky real funeral footage of Bruce Lee that would come next.Now the movie gets more interesting and less exploitative. Bobby learns of his brother's death from his father who tells him to meet Sherman Lan. Sherman tells him to go to the Palace of Death. Now this is an interesting place. It is owned by Lewis, played by Roy Horan who has been an executive at Seasonal, an actor who also acted in Snake in the Eagle's Shadow, a student of Hwang Jang Lee and currently a lecturer at HK Polytechnic University; obviously his life is more interesting than this film. Bobby suspects Lewis as the culprit behind his brother's death. Lewis likes to eat raw meat, is surrounded by lions (who are fed the fighters that he defeats), Killer Peacocks and a one-armed valet (oh my). The one-armed assistant, a monk from the Fan Yu temple) does not seem that he could be of great use to Lewis, but Lewis says that he is faithful and he has known him for a long time (do not dwell on this fact because the absurdity of what happens later is quite hilarious). I really do not trust one-armed people in Hong Kong films unless they are played by Jimmy Wang Yu.Lewis tells Bobby of a tower built by abbot Hung Kuang. However, it cannot be found above ground. The abbot had it built underground (this is a nice twist until you see how much they spent on the set design and how many levels there actually are). Obviously there is going to be a show down there with Bobby fighting however is behind all of this madness. I will not give it away (or tell what happens at the Palace of Death) but it is fairly obvious who it will be.The final act of the film leads to some good fighting scenes, obviously with the help of action director Yuen Wo-Ping, as Bobby makes his way down the tower (try to see how many times Yuen Biao is used as a stunt double; hint check every other move Bobby makes). Most of the film is entertaining (not counting the irritating and unnecessary flashbacks). There is always going to be tackiness involved anytime you invoke Bruce Lee's inimitable name; but once the movie gets past that it is fun to watch. In fact it is the best Bruceploitation film out there -- though that does not necessarily mean that much.",3,Beware of the Killer Peacocks!,1181692800,"06 13, 2007",2007,4452,"['Game', 'Death', 'II', 'aka', 'Tower', 'Death', 'dichotomy', 'film', 'Bruceploitation', 'film', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'exiting', 'revenge', 'flick', 'Raymond', 'Chow', 'had', 'apparently', 'not', 'made', 'enough', 'money', 'insipid', 'Game', 'Death', 'was', 'slowly', 'leaking', 'newly', 'found', 'footage', 'Bruce', 'was', 'bound', 'would', 'create', 'film', 'spliced', 'footage', 'redubbed', 'dialog', 'course', 'Bruce', 'namesake', 'lot', 'people', 'were', 'using', 'Lee', 'name', 'promote', 'own', 'productions', 'Golden', 'Harvest', 'who', 'Bruce', 'worked', 'technically', 'was', 'Seasonal', 'production', 'was', 'worst', 'offenders.The', 'first', 'act', 'movie', 'least', 'interesting', 'worst', 'part', 'film', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'stars', 'posthumously', 'edited', 'Billy', 'Lo', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'who', 'friend', 'Chin', 'Ku', 'Hwang', 'Jang', 'Lee', 'who', 'currently', 'beating', 'up', 'under-classed', 'challenger', 'reestablishment', 'friendship', 'two', 'never', 'good', 'sign', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'film', 'abbot', 'Roy', 'Chiao', 'revisiting', 'role', 'Enter', 'Dragon', 'can', 'reuse', 'redub', 'footage', 'discuss', 'contumacious', 'brother', 'Bobby', 'Lo', 'Tong', 'Lung', 'who', 'also', 'starred', 'Game', 'Death', '.Of', 'course', 'scenes', 'compromise', 'first', 'act', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'exploitative', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'are', 'also', 'poorly', 'done', 'most', 'obvious', 'backgrounds', 'do', 'not', 'match', 'Bruce', 'footage', 'new', 'footage', 'Also', 'check', 'out', 'sculpted', 'back', 'muscles', 'Bruce', 'compare', 'double', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Bruce', 'double', 'do', 'not', 'flow', 'well', 'However', 'anytime', 'see', 'fight', 'scene', 'Bruce', 'double', 'difficult', 'move', 'such', 'flip', 'will', 'notice', 'incomparable', 'Yuen', 'Biao', 'even', 'small', 'role', 'beginning', 'Bruce', 'later', 'visits', 'funeral', 'friend', 'Chin', 'Ku', 'prevented', 'examining', 'body', 'must', 'mean', 'something', 'plot', 'When', 'ceremony', 'place', 'helicopter', 'snags', 'coffin', 'strange', 'reason', 'well', 'dispose', 'fake', 'Bruce', 'character', 'coffin', 'flying', 'away', 'hit', 'dart', 'death', 'absolutely', 'absurd', 'not', 'as', 'bad', '70s', 'clothes', 'funeral', 'tacky', 'real', 'funeral', 'footage', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'would', 'come', 'movie', 'more', 'interesting', 'less', 'exploitative', 'Bobby', 'brother', 'death', 'father', 'who', 'meet', 'Sherman', 'Lan', 'Sherman', 'go', 'Palace', 'Death', 'Now', 'interesting', 'place', 'owned', 'Lewis', 'played', 'Roy', 'Horan', 'who', 'been', 'executive', 'Seasonal', 'actor', 'who', 'also', 'acted', 'Snake', 'Eagle', 'Shadow', 'student', 'Hwang', 'Jang', 'Lee', 'currently', 'lecturer', 'HK', 'Polytechnic', 'University', 'obviously', 'life', 'more', 'interesting', 'film', 'Bobby', 'Lewis', 'culprit', 'brother', 'death', 'Lewis', 'eat', 'raw', 'meat', 'surrounded', 'lions', 'who', 'are', 'fed', 'fighters', 'Killer', 'Peacocks', 'one-armed', 'valet', 'one-armed', 'assistant', 'monk', 'Fan', 'Yu', 'temple', 'not', 'seem', 'could', 'be', 'great', 'use', 'Lewis', 'Lewis', 'faithful', 'known', 'long', 'time', 'do', 'not', 'dwell', 'fact', 'absurdity', 'what', 'later', 'quite', 'hilarious', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'trust', 'one-armed', 'people', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'films', 'are', 'played', 'Jimmy', 'Wang', 'Yu.Lewis', 'Bobby', 'tower', 'built', 'abbot', 'Hung', 'Kuang', 'However', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'ground', 'abbot', 'had', 'built', 'underground', 'nice', 'twist', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'spent', 'set', 'design', 'how', 'many', 'levels', 'actually', 'are', 'Obviously', 'going', 'be', 'show', 'down', 'there', 'Bobby', 'fighting', 'however', 'madness', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'tell', 'what', 'Palace', 'Death', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'who', 'will', 'be.The', 'final', 'act', 'film', 'good', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'obviously', 'help', 'action', 'director', 'Yuen', 'Wo-Ping', 'Bobby', 'way', 'tower', 'try', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'Yuen', 'Biao', 'used', 'stunt', 'double', 'hint', 'check', 'other', 'move', 'Bobby', 'Most', 'film', 'entertaining', 'not', 'counting', 'irritating', 'unnecessary', 'flashbacks', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'tackiness', 'involved', 'anytime', 'invoke', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'inimitable', 'name', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch', 'fact', 'best', 'Bruceploitation', 'film', 'there', 'not', 'necessarily', 'mean', 'much']",N/A
554107,A3NTG7KH8XSGU9,B00004W5W7,Takeshi Tetsuryu,"[1, 1]","This film stands with a rare distiction in my collection; it is quite probably the only film ever that I actually prefer watching dubbed, despite my dogmatic preference for subtitles. However, this has nothing to do with the quality of the dub; in fact, it is very much the lack of it.Game of Death II, or Tower of Death as it is known in the orient (the original language version makes no connection with Game of Death) is by no means a good film. However, it is an immensely entertaining one, despite of, or possibly because of it's incompetence. Between the genuinely well-choreographed fighting scenes (by none other than Yuen-Woo Ping, the man who would later gain fame through his work in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and the Matrix films - with generous amount of help from Sammo Hung, who performed the same task in Game of Death and even Enter the Dragon), there is something appalling to gawk at, whether it's the token caucasian actor's hilarious characteristics, the casual disregard to Bruce Lee's memory or the paperthin plot itself. Tong Lung plays the brother of Bruce Lee's character, named Bobby Lo in the dub, but we do not see him until the 40 minute mark...except that we do. Tong Lung DOES play the main character through the entire film, it's just that he does it as Bruce Lee's body double through the first half of the film and then switches to the Bobby Lo character after Bruce Lee's character is unceremoniously killed off. Confused yet?Yuen-Woo Ping is not the only big name in the martial arts film world to be involved in the production of this either. Hwang-Jang Lee appears as Billy Lo's friend, showing off his martial arts skills right in the beginning, and in the english dub version, this is followed almost immediately by the glass house fight scene with Casanova Wong, lifted from the Asian version of Game of Death - with all the fight scenes in this film, it's difficult to be bored by it for sure. The movie was directed by See-Yuen Ng, who later produced several of the early Jackie Chan classics like Snake in the Eagle's Shadow and the Drunken Master.But what of the plot? Apparently, Bruce Lee was still enormously popular in Japan by 1980s, and there was enough desire to see one more Bruce Lee film to send him off. With promises of previously unseen footage, a production team was put together who would then discover that, apart from some deleted scenes from Enter the Dragon (which, by the way, have since been reinstated in that film, so if you've seen that movie on DVD, there's absolutely nothing new here), so a plot was hastily put together where Billy Lo is played by ""Bruce Lee"" (actually Tong Lung, with a generous amount of stock footage to try and hide the fact it's not actually Bruce Lee) for much of the first part of the film, trying to discover the reason behind the death of his friend. As mysteries build up, the producers run out of meaningful footage to use to cover Bruce Lee's absence so he is simply shot to death (and followed by, again in just as tasteless a move as it was in Game of Death, actual footage from Bruce Lee's funeral), and the main protagonist becomes Tong Lung, now showing his face as Bobby Lo, continuing the investigation.But good lord, what about the regional differences? The added scenes in the dubbed version also help a great deal in adding to the sheer surreality of it all, especially a scene near the beginning where Bruce Lee (actually played by Bruce Lee) discusses with the Abbot (actually dubbed over footage from Enter the Dragon), and when the Abbot discusses Billy Lo's childhood, the dub version throws in some old 8mm home movies of Bruce Lee's actual childhood (the on-screen captions even identify by his real name(!) rather than his character name, in a bizarre break of the fourth wall).This is quite possibly one of my favourite movies of all time. It's the one I like to watch several times without losing it's ""magic"", and I love talking about it whenever the possibility occurs - this review could still go on for ages but I believe you should really just see it for yourself. As long as you have no misconceptions about this being an actual Bruce Lee film, you're going to have a great time.",5,Far more entertaining than it should be,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,4213,"['film', 'rare', 'distiction', 'collection', 'quite', 'probably', 'only', 'film', 'ever', 'actually', 'prefer', 'watching', 'dubbed', 'dogmatic', 'preference', 'subtitles', 'However', 'nothing', 'do', 'quality', 'dub', 'fact', 'very', 'much', 'lack', 'it.Game', 'Death', 'II', 'Tower', 'Death', 'known', 'orient', 'original', 'language', 'version', 'connection', 'Game', 'Death', 'means', 'good', 'film', 'However', 'immensely', 'entertaining', 'one', 'possibly', 'incompetence', 'genuinely', 'well-choreographed', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'none', 'other', 'Yuen-Woo', 'Ping', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'gain', 'fame', 'work', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'Matrix', 'films', 'generous', 'amount', 'help', 'Sammo', 'Hung', 'who', 'performed', 'same', 'task', 'Game', 'Death', 'even', 'Enter', 'Dragon', 'something', 'appalling', 'gawk', 'token', 'caucasian', 'actor', 'hilarious', 'characteristics', 'casual', 'disregard', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'memory', 'paperthin', 'plot', 'Tong', 'Lung', 'brother', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'character', 'named', 'Bobby', 'Lo', 'dub', 'do', 'not', 'see', '40', 'minute', 'mark', 'do', 'Tong', 'Lung', 'DOES', 'play', 'main', 'character', 'entire', 'film', 'just', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'body', 'double', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'then', 'switches', 'Bobby', 'Lo', 'character', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'character', 'unceremoniously', 'killed', 'off', 'Confused', 'yet', 'Yuen-Woo', 'Ping', 'not', 'only', 'big', 'name', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'world', 'be', 'involved', 'production', 'Hwang-Jang', 'Lee', 'Billy', 'Lo', 'friend', 'showing', 'off', 'martial', 'arts', 'skills', 'right', 'beginning', 'english', 'dub', 'version', 'followed', 'almost', 'immediately', 'glass', 'house', 'fight', 'scene', 'Casanova', 'Wong', 'lifted', 'Asian', 'version', 'Game', 'Death', 'fight', 'scenes', 'film', 'difficult', 'be', 'bored', 'sure', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'See-Yuen', 'Ng', 'who', 'later', 'produced', 'several', 'early', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'classics', 'Snake', 'Eagle', 'Shadow', 'Drunken', 'Master.But', 'what', 'plot', 'Apparently', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'was', 'still', 'enormously', 'popular', 'Japan', '1980s', 'was', 'enough', 'desire', 'see', 'one', 'more', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'film', 'send', 'off', 'promises', 'previously', 'unseen', 'footage', 'production', 'team', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'who', 'would', 'then', 'discover', 'apart', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Enter', 'Dragon', 'way', 'have', 'been', 'reinstated', 'film', 'so', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', 'so', 'plot', 'was', 'hastily', 'put', 'together', 'where', 'Billy', 'Lo', 'played', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'actually', 'Tong', 'Lung', 'generous', 'amount', 'stock', 'footage', 'try', 'hide', 'fact', 'not', 'actually', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'much', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'trying', 'discover', 'reason', 'death', 'friend', 'mysteries', 'build', 'up', 'producers', 'run', 'meaningful', 'footage', 'use', 'cover', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'absence', 'so', 'simply', 'shot', 'death', 'followed', 'again', 'just', 'tasteless', 'move', 'was', 'Game', 'Death', 'actual', 'footage', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'funeral', 'main', 'protagonist', 'Tong', 'Lung', 'now', 'showing', 'face', 'Bobby', 'Lo', 'continuing', 'investigation.But', 'good', 'lord', 'what', 'regional', 'differences', 'added', 'scenes', 'dubbed', 'version', 'also', 'great', 'deal', 'adding', 'sheer', 'surreality', 'especially', 'scene', 'beginning', 'where', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'actually', 'played', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'Abbot', 'actually', 'dubbed', 'footage', 'Enter', 'Dragon', 'when', 'Abbot', 'Billy', 'Lo', 'childhood', 'dub', 'version', 'throws', 'old', '8mm', 'home', 'movies', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'actual', 'childhood', 'on-screen', 'captions', 'even', 'identify', 'real', 'name', 'rather', 'character', 'name', 'bizarre', 'break', 'fourth', 'wall', '.This', 'quite', 'possibly', 'one', 'favourite', 'movies', 'time', 'one', 'like', 'watch', 'several', 'times', 'losing', 'magic', 'love', 'talking', 'whenever', 'possibility', 'review', 'could', 'still', 'go', 'ages', 'believe', 'should', 'really', 'just', 'see', 'As', 'long', 'have', 'misconceptions', 'being', 'actual', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'film', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'great', 'time']",N/A
