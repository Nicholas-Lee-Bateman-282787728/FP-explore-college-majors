Nothing happens. Seriously. Nothing.Oh, there's atmosphere--about as much as looking at the nice art CAN give. Stuff is happening SOMEwhere, but not on camera. To perfectly sum up what goes on, our hero is traveling with a totally clueless girl blathering on about nothing; a tiny monster appears out of nowhere and the hero kills it; the girl does not notice.Completely forgettable and a chore to watch, especially if you have any kind of expectations for action--ACTION?

1495973,A3C1PJUQ3EU1SQ,B005NQ5LLE,"John Dandell ""McRussell""","[0, 0]","On the quality of this show: The animations for DMC are fluid enough. They put a sizable effort into it. The graphic style is similar to the movie Blood. Not every cell is super detailed but its more than enough. The sound mixing is very good. Its setup for someone with a home theatre. Lots of cool music that was as good as the game and lots of gun sounds. The voice acting is good and silly like the video game. I'd say thats where it shares the most similarity.The plot of this show is more like Buffy with some kind of an anime twist. Lots of demon slaying. Dante does jobs for different people and is struggling to survive. You get some typical supporting characters that were added for comic effect. Dante is himself and so is the city he lives in. It does expand the game very well in that respect. The early episodes were one I enjoy most. For $20 you get a nice distraction and a high quality set. I'd recommend this for DMC fans, and maybe not every anime fan out there, but I'm sure some people unfamiliar with the game will also like it. Its pretty much hours of demon slaying, OK dialogue, good animation and good music. There is nothing that you could say was a disappointment. The downside is there is nothing in here that will change your life. Its a set to watch when you are bored.

One part I think that people will like in ep 1 is while Dante is driving her to the will reading he pulls the girls hat down over her eyes then with his gun kills the demon that is about to kill her while it is holding on to the side of a moving truck without stopping his car I personally found that to be freaking awesomeSome of Dante's cases include a rich man who's daughter is being romanced by a handsome guy with powers and her father thinking he's a danger to her wants Dante to kill the guy, that tale has a very interesting little twist to it I don't want to give it away and spoil it for anyoneAn ancient jeweled mask that grants wishes with a twistThe beautiful human singer who mysteriously disappeared some time ago and when one of her songs is played appears as a deadly demonessA motorcycle racer racing another guy trying to evenge his brothers death a situation that has a freaky unexpected surprise in itLater on it leads up to patty again unknowningly patty and her mother are part of a lower level demons plot to gain great power he is gathering various artifacts to perform a ritual in order to obtain his goalIf you love lots of action mixed with humor, and interesting characters like Lady a human female devil hunter who works with Dante and the one who also busts his chops at times.

I thought this show would be like the game where in tough times, Dante will need to show his true form and that's when he transforms himself to demon mode. I don't know why they didn't do that. It was a very big part of the game and it was awesome to do. Heck, even in Marvel Vs Capcom 3, Dante can devil trigger and that give him more power, speed, etc.It wasn't like they didn't know about it either. They had Dante enemies turn into Demon form, and that gave them more power, but Dante himself didn't do it. And, they were very much like Dante, half human and all. Does that mean he couldn't do it? Does that mean he didn't know how to? Does that mean, he didn't need it because he cocky like that? I don't know because it doesn't show or explain this at all.I thought at the very end of the series that...okay...maybe, just maybe, this will be the moment. He going to do!!! He has to do it!!!

He didn't need life gain, which I believe he looked like 1 cm of life left - the last bad guy should had just touch him with a finger and he should had be finished. What in the world? Dante didn't need to do anything at all. He had it in him all this time?
