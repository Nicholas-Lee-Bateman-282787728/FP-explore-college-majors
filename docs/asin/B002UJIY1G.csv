To complicate the moment, already compromised by the loss of her mother just a couple months earlier, she is approached about selling her dance studio. The studio had been her mother's and Cyd (Brooke Nevin)is doing some serious consideration toward the sale. After all, the dancing was really her mother's dream. There is a hitch in the estate, since the deed includes Cyd's father, Tanner (John Schneider) one she never met, or knew anything about.He's contacted through the help of Cyd's lawyer, who was also a close friend of her mother, Laura (Roma Downey). They meet, it's good, but Tanner's not sure about Cyd selling the studio. This leads to some interesting relationship issues, in many different places, young and old. Oh yes, and expect your heart to be stolen by little Amber (Sydney Stamler) a sweet little scene stealer, appearing periodically all through the movie.Bottom line, it's Hallmark, and the ending will prove to the ""the very best.""

1289765,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B002UJIY1G,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","25-year-old dance instructor Cyd - named after Cyd Charisse - Merriman (Brooke Nevin) seeks to expand her horizons, aspires to become a therapist. She'll get married in one week's time. She's about to let go of her dance studio to a real estate developer who's offering triple its worth. The money coming in should be more than enough to underwrite her grad school.The bump on the road comes unexpectedly. Turns out, her passed-away mom had left the studio to her AND to her father, someone she'd never even known still existed. Cyd requires her sudden father's signature to finalize the studio's purchase.Color Tanner Gray (John Schneider) shocked, finding out that he had a daughter. A carpenter and a nomad for the past 25 years, Tanner could've just mailed over his consenting signature. Instead, he makes his way over to the small town of Gracie, home to his daughter, one week before her wedding. He's got all this free time since he just got let go from his construction gig. Right away the cynical viewer may wonder about his role concerning his daughter's impending financial windfall.COME DANCE AT MY WEDDING obviously centers around the father-daughter interplay. If you're one of them folks whose emotional buttons are easily tweaked, then this film has got something for you. John Schneider has come a ways from his breezy stint in THE DUKES OF HAZZARD. Here, he projects a commanding presence, and you can't blame Nevin's Cyd Merriman for getting bowled over by this charming but overprotective newfound dad.Brooke Nevin, for her part, turns in a winsome performance. There has to be some sort of narrative conflict, and it makes sense that Cyd and Tanner, strangers to each other, wouldn't see eye to eye. The core of their beef, though, doesn't hinge on that clich&eacute;d ""Dad, why did you abandon my mom and me?"" Instead, it's about that Tanner is concerned that Cyd is giving up on the dance studio which has been a generational family enterprise. You may wonder why Tanner is so concerned about family tradition, considering that he's the one long stricken with wanderlust. But this is explained away, too.For fans of Roma Downey (remember her?), she has a supporting part as the family lawyer looking out for Cyd's interests. As such, she and Schneider end up not seeing eye to eye. Another thing I appreciate is that the show could've followed thru - but didn't - on its portrayal of Cyd's fianc&eacute; (Christopher Jacot) as an arsehat. He certainly provides one more divisive element in Cyd and Tanner's relationship.The film's best moments take place in Cyd's dance studio. You don't ever doubt that Brooke Nevin's character is a dancer. The mini-revelation is that John Schneider also has skills on the dance floor. Now the film doesn't go crazy with Schneider. You won't see him pop and lock or perform an epic Fred Astaire-ish tap number. But he convinces as someone who knows his way around the dance studio. COME DANCE AT MY WEDDING is a Hallmark picture, so it conveys everything that a standard Hallmark picture would. It's not objectionable, it's not controversial. There's a strong family-driven plot. It promotes all the things that you'd want your kids to pick up on. It's comfort television. It's got John Schneider doing a mean tango. 3.5 out of 5 stars.",4,"essentially, the mom goofed",1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,3294,"['25-year-old', 'dance', 'instructor', 'Cyd', 'named', 'Cyd', 'Charisse', 'Merriman', 'Brooke', 'Nevin', 'expand', 'horizons', 'become', 'therapist', ""'ll"", 'get', 'married', 'one', 'week', 'time', 'let', 'go', 'dance', 'studio', 'real', 'estate', 'developer', 'who', 'offering', 'triple', 'worth', 'money', 'coming', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'enough', 'underwrite', 'grad', 'school.The', 'bump', 'road', 'unexpectedly', 'out', 'passed-away', 'mom', 'had', 'left', 'studio', 'AND', 'father', 'someone', ""'d"", 'never', 'even', 'known', 'still', 'existed', 'Cyd', 'sudden', 'father', 'signature', 'finalize', 'studio', 'purchase.Color', 'Tanner', 'Gray', 'John', 'Schneider', 'shocked', 'finding', 'out', 'had', 'daughter', 'carpenter', 'nomad', 'past', '25', 'years', 'Tanner', 'could', ""'ve"", 'just', 'mailed', 'over', 'consenting', 'signature', 'Instead', 'way', 'small', 'town', 'Gracie', 'home', 'daughter', 'one', 'week', 'wedding', 'got', 'free', 'time', 'just', 'got', 'let', 'go', 'construction', 'gig', 'Right', 'away', 'cynical', 'viewer', 'may', 'wonder', 'role', 'concerning', 'daughter', 'impending', 'financial', 'windfall.COME', 'DANCE', 'AT', 'MY', 'WEDDING', 'obviously', 'father-daughter', 'interplay', ""'re"", 'one', 'folks', 'emotional', 'buttons', 'are', 'easily', 'tweaked', 'then', 'film', 'got', 'something', 'John', 'Schneider', 'come', 'ways', 'breezy', 'stint', 'THE', 'DUKES', 'OF', 'HAZZARD', 'Here', 'projects', 'commanding', 'presence', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Nevin', 'Cyd', 'Merriman', 'getting', 'bowled', 'over', 'charming', 'overprotective', 'newfound', 'dad.Brooke', 'Nevin', 'part', 'winsome', 'performance', 'be', 'sort', 'narrative', 'conflict', 'sense', 'Cyd', 'Tanner', 'strangers', 'other', 'would', ""n't"", 'see', 'eye', 'eye', 'core', 'beef', 'though', ""n't"", 'hinge', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Dad', 'why', 'did', 'abandon', 'mom', 'Instead', 'Tanner', 'concerned', 'Cyd', 'giving', 'up', 'dance', 'studio', 'been', 'generational', 'family', 'enterprise', 'may', 'wonder', 'why', 'Tanner', 'so', 'concerned', 'family', 'tradition', 'considering', 'one', 'long', 'stricken', 'wanderlust', 'explained', 'away', 'too.For', 'fans', 'Roma', 'Downey', 'remember', 'supporting', 'part', 'family', 'lawyer', 'looking', 'out', 'Cyd', 'interests', 'such', 'Schneider', 'end', 'up', 'not', 'seeing', 'eye', 'eye', 'thing', 'appreciate', 'show', 'could', ""'ve"", 'followed', 'thru', 'did', ""n't"", 'portrayal', 'Cyd', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Christopher', 'Jacot', 'arsehat', 'certainly', 'one', 'more', 'divisive', 'element', 'Cyd', 'Tanner', 'relationship.The', 'film', 'best', 'moments', 'take', 'place', 'Cyd', 'dance', 'studio', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'doubt', 'Brooke', 'Nevin', 'character', 'dancer', 'mini-revelation', 'John', 'Schneider', 'also', 'skills', 'dance', 'floor', 'Now', 'film', ""n't"", 'go', 'crazy', 'Schneider', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'pop', 'lock', 'perform', 'epic', 'Fred', 'Astaire-ish', 'tap', 'number', 'someone', 'who', 'way', 'dance', 'studio', 'COME', 'DANCE', 'AT', 'MY', 'WEDDING', 'Hallmark', 'picture', 'everything', 'standard', 'Hallmark', 'picture', 'would', 'not', 'objectionable', 'not', 'controversial', 'strong', 'family-driven', 'plot', 'things', ""'d"", 'want', 'kids', 'pick', 'up', 'comfort', 'television', 'got', 'John', 'Schneider', 'doing', 'mean', 'tango', '3.5', '5', 'stars']",N/A

It had belonged to her grandparents before that. Developers come along and offer her really good money to sell the studio. She sees her opportunity to have the money to go to school and be able to make a difference in the world, and her fiance encourages that line of thought. The fly in the ointment is that the family attorney (Roma Downey) informs her that her father's name is on the deed. She has never known her father and didn't even know he was still alive. On the flip side, he never knew he had a daughter.Her parents had met while teaching dance on a cruise ship. When her father returned home with her mother after the cruise her grandparents wouldn't let him move in to their home unless the two got married--so they did. Her mother soon decided that he was going to feel tied down and possibly end up leaving them later, so when he left town temporarily for a job, she wrote him and told him never to come back--not mentioning that she was expecting their child.When her father gets word of his daughter's existence, and of the situation with the studio, he has just lost his job, so he shows up in town and stays a while. He becomes a roadblock to the deal with developers. When he finally becomes convinced that his name still being on the deed was just an oversight he signs the necessary papers and leaves town before his daughter's wedding. Then something happens that changes everything.It is pretty predictable, but the characters are, for the most part, likable. Jon Schneider as a dance teacher was an interesting idea to absorb. It is probably more of a 3 1/2 star movie IMO, but at least it isn't the standard formula of a single parent dating the wrong person before the right one comes along.",4,"Good, but not outstanding",1266537600,"02 19, 2010",2010,1835,"['young', 'woman', 'engaged', 'be', 'married', 'family', 'dance', 'studio', 'inherited', 'when', 'mother', 'died', 'had', 'belonged', 'grandparents', 'Developers', 'come', 'along', 'offer', 'really', 'good', 'money', 'sell', 'studio', 'opportunity', 'have', 'money', 'go', 'school', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'difference', 'world', 'fiance', 'line', 'thought', 'fly', 'ointment', 'family', 'attorney', 'Roma', 'Downey', 'father', 'name', 'deed', 'never', 'known', 'father', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'flip', 'side', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'daughter.Her', 'parents', 'had', 'met', 'teaching', 'dance', 'cruise', 'ship', 'When', 'father', 'returned', 'home', 'mother', 'cruise', 'grandparents', 'would', ""n't"", 'let', 'move', 'home', 'two', 'got', 'married', 'did', 'mother', 'soon', 'decided', 'was', 'going', 'feel', 'tied', 'down', 'possibly', 'end', 'up', 'leaving', 'later', 'so', 'when', 'left', 'town', 'temporarily', 'job', 'wrote', 'told', 'never', 'come', 'back', 'not', 'mentioning', 'was', 'expecting', 'child.When', 'father', 'word', 'daughter', 'existence', 'situation', 'studio', 'just', 'lost', 'job', 'up', 'town', 'while', 'roadblock', 'deal', 'developers', 'When', 'finally', 'convinced', 'name', 'still', 'being', 'deed', 'was', 'just', 'oversight', 'signs', 'necessary', 'papers', 'town', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'Then', 'something', 'changes', 'everything.It', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'characters', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'likable', 'Jon', 'Schneider', 'dance', 'teacher', 'was', 'interesting', 'idea', 'absorb', 'probably', 'more', '3', '1/2', 'star', 'movie', 'IMO', 'least', ""n't"", 'standard', 'formula', 'single', 'parent', 'dating', 'wrong', 'person', 'right', 'one', 'along']",N/A
