This is a very resourceful detective with a honed sense of observation.  He is slow in making personal decisions and I am constantly giving him unspoken advice on how to respond to Julia.  Detective Murdoch is not afraid to pursue a lead even if others think he is chasing rainbows.  Although it is not the focus of this series, I like how the writers are able to convey important women's issues for this period of time.  This series goes from the late 1800's to the early 1900's and the writers show the struggle women had but in a very good ""story-telling"" fashion.  It is also evident in this series that detective Murdoch has great respect for the part that others play in his pursuits.  He is actually just an all-around nice guy who also happens to be very smart.

But the second season smooths out the steampunky mystery show's wrinkles -- lots of mysteries, bizarre crimes, then-cutting-edge science, and unexpected twists. And even better, the writers introduce more character development into the everyday plots, ranging from romance to ""temperance.""First, Buffalo Bill's Wild West show stopping in Toronto meets with disaster when the old catching-a-bullet-with-teeth trick goes horribly awry, leaving Murdoch to figure out which of the gunslingers had a killing grudge. Then when prostitutes are found gutted around Toronto, a British detective arrives with shocking news -- he believes Jack the Ripper is alive and in their city.And as the season goes on, Murdoch has to deal with a dead body in dinosaur jaws, a bank robbery pinned on Harry Houdini, a strangled prostitute, a girl who bled to death after a botched abortion, a professor shot through a window, a suspicious substitute landlady, lonely telegraph operators found dead after romancing ""A.K.,"" mysterious poisonings in the Jewish community, a spree of werewolf attacks, an infuriating Mountie whose methods resemble his. Weirdest of all: a bizarre adventure involving a small boy, a robot, a dead dwarf and a Prussian.And as they solve these various crimes, the constabulary has a series of its own problems: Inspector Brackenreid's marriage is under strain because his wife has joined the Temperance League, Colonel Crabtree searches for his mother, and the new romance between Murdoch and Dr. Ogden crumbles when he discovers a secret about her past (so he dates a beautiful young widow instead).""Murdoch Mysteries Season Two"" loosens up on the strict format that it followed in the first season, meaning we get episodes like ""Convalescence"" (in which Crabtree temporarily takes Murdoch's place) and lots of personal subplots that stretch over many episodes. Even better: the preachy 21st-century tone has died down, and the writers are more even-handed when dealing with touchy subjects like abortion or prejudice against American Indians.And the writers continue to litter the show with historical personages (Houdini, Buffalo Bill) and then-new technology (X-ray machines, night-vision goggles). The mysteries are smooth, solid and usually fairly intricate, with plenty of blood, corpses and occasional psychopaths -- as well as some humorous moments (a parrot that keeps yelling, ""Cochon, cochon! You are a pig! You get out of here!"" at the inspector).Yannick Bisson remains an excellent if slightly uptight detective, and we get to see Murdoch loosen up as well -- he's confronted by challenges to his feelings, his morals, and occasionally to the world as he knows it (although the lassoing scene was a bit ridiculous). Helene Joy, Thomas Craig and Jonny Harris round out a solid cast with some good chemistry, although Sarah Allen's Enid Jones (appropriately) has zero chemistry with Bisson.""Murdoch Mysteries Season Two"" sands down the rough edges of this show, and manages to introduce more character development without losing sight of all the murder and crime.

There is also a ""love interest"".  Murdock who is very shy is besotted by the pathologist acted by Helen Joy.  She adds just the right amount of humor (the character calls it ""morgue humor"").

Comedy, mystery, adventure and romance unite perfectly in a Victorian setting. This is Victorian murder investigations with contemporary evidence gathering techniques. Murdoch (Yannick Bisson) is a century ahead of his forensic sleuthing counterparts. Dr. Ogden (Helene Joy) is the gorgeous pathologist in the forensics search--the morgue maiden. Victorian 'sparks' happen between Murdoch and Dr.O, but at he cautious, delicate, discretionary Victorian rate. Romantic chemistry cleverly woven into murder investigations. Insp. Brackenreid (Thomas Craig) ex-army & boss, plus Crabtree (Jonny Harris) ambitious right-hand man, are back in every episode. 4 TV stars who make this a 5-star Series. Also plenty of guest stars.All episodes are police investigations with interesting new technology or science helping find clues. Marvelously inventive in plot and beautiful to view it the realistic Victorian era. Perfection in sets, costumes, and props. It's no wonder it is award grabbing and still continues currently with new adventures on TV. This series is the 2009 season, at DVD release less than a year past original airing.It is dreadful, dastardly, murder situations, with some violence and blood (especially in Dr.O's morgue clue-gathering scenes), and multiple plot episodes. Highly recommended for the mystery, crime, and even Victorian romance fans.Bonus includes SDH SUBTITLES, behind the scenes, character bios, 4 cast filmographies, 7 Murdoch (Maureen Jennings) novels (1997-2007), and a PDF on props.You will want to check the listing for Murdoch Mysteries Series 1 also.

Uses profiles, fingermarks, and ultraviolet light for clue finding.3 Dinosaur Fever--A dino find from Alberta Badlands, Terrorsaurus, causes murder at a National Geo. Soc. event. Murdoch & Dr.O use Rontgen's rays (x-ray).4 Houdini Whodunit--Murdoch uses a crime scene model to help find the guilty when Houdini Bros perform in a theater next to a bank which is robbed, a guard killed. Is Dr.O's sis, Ruby involved?5 The Green Muse--Who murdered the victim employed at the local elite bordello? Plenty of beauties in delectable Victorian 'evening-wear.' Plenty of suspects.6 Shades of Grey--Murdoch and Dr.O 'relationship' heats. An unclothed male victim seems cold murder. Evidence leads to a former flame of Dr.O.

It takes mathematics on the verge of computer logic to find out.9 Convalescence--Murcoch incapacitating injuries give Crabtree a chance to solve the murder. Murdoch's healing is mixed between beautiful caregivers, strange noises, and a 2nd mystery at his own living quarters. Interesting, those night vision goggles. Double mystery--double romance--good X 2.10 Murdoch.com--The dueling romance continues with Murdoch's scintillating admirers. A murdered girl, a telegrapher, had a 'wire affair' that may be a lead to the killer.11 Let Us Ask the Maiden--Murder in a synagogue leads to love relationships in conflict due to Jewish law. Murdoch still has his own female conflict between Dr.O and Enid.12 Werewolves--Hunting partners suddenly are murdered one-by-one apparently by a werewolf. On the romantic side, Enid suggests to Murdoch it is time to choose.13 Anything You Can Do (I can do better. Pffft!)--In an abandoned mining town, Murdoch and a Canadian Mounty (an almost detective clone) are caught in a crossfire. Flashbacks show how the 2 murder investigations brought these men to this trap. A new metal, aluminium, to the rescue?A FANTASTIC SEASON-ENDING EPISODE.",5,AWARD-WINNING VICTORIAN CRIME & ROMANCE,1270080000,"04 1, 2010",2010,4471,"['More', '1890s', 'Toronto', 'cop',

The series has, as its hero, a man who is too innocent to be true, especially since he's a wiz at solving murders. There are a few things that are incongruous, like &#34;new&#34; buildings with obviously old trim. Although the acting is of a good quality the shows are low budget (the same street scenes repeat) and some of the issues are modern dressed in old clothes. The Doctor never gets dirty while performing autopsies and the show is very politically correct in some places. At times the story is anachronistic.

1319688,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B00331RHPO,Stephanie De Pue,"[1, 1]","""Murdoch Mysteries Season Two"" strikes me as a British mystery, although it's set in Canada and uses Canadian actors, because it appears to have been jointly produced by ITV Global Entertainment, and Granada International, two companies surely at least artistically headquartered in Great Britain. The stylish, contemporary television series, a costumed historical police procedural, is set in the Toronto of the 1890's, and features ""cutting edge Victorian science."" The boxed set at hand consists of four DVD's comprising 13 episodes, approximately 598 minutes, of the series that debuted in Canada in January, 2008. And, all praises to Acorn Media, subtitles, in addition to the usual extra features, interviews and such.  This series is now available to American audiences for the first time.""Murdoch Season Two"" debuted on Canada on CityTV in March 2009.  Season One is currently airing on American Public Television channels, with Season Two shortly to follow.  The entertainment is based on characters from the detective novels of Maureen Jennings: the first published, in 1997,Except the Dying (Murdoch Mysteries); to be followed by six more in the series. Jennings is creative consultant on the TV series that aims to give us a look at the dawn of forensic sleuthing.  It has won three Gemini Awards, and been nominated for 20 Geminis in just two seasons.It centers on Detective William Murdoch (Yannick Bisson,:Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye (2002 TVseries)""), who adopts modern forensic techniques such as ""finger marks,"" ballistics, criminal profiling, night vision goggles, and early X-rays. His skeptical, old-school boss Inspector Brackenreid (Thomas Craig, ""Where the Heart Is"" ); gung-ho prot&eacute;g&eacute; Constable George Crabtree (Jonny Harris, ""Hatching, Matching & Dispatching""); and comely pathologist Dr. Julia Ogden (Helene Joy, ""Durham County"") aid and abet his efforts. Most of the plots are ingenious, quick-moving, and reasonably original/complex for their length; some do generate emotional power. Some ingenuity has also been invested in bringing celebrities of the age to Toronto: the current series gives us Buffalo Bill Cody, Annie Oakley, Harry Houdini, the famous escape artist; and possibly Jack the Ripper. The series is nicely filmed, and its makers haven't stinted on its budget, plenty of people and vehicles in the street and the station. Finally, I must say, I seemed to enjoy the second series even more than the first: perhaps the actors are loosening up in their roles.The episodes are:1. ""Mild, Mild West."" Buffalo Bill's Carnival, featuring famous crack shot Annie Oakley, comes to town.  Its performance, however, is marred by murder.2. ""Snakes and Ladders.""  Has Jack the Ripper left England and begun to travel the English-speaking world, finally to land in Toronto?  Grisly murders of working women begin to make it look that way.3. ""Dinosaur Fever.""  Murder among feuding paleontologists. Murdoch and Dr. Ogden utilize an early X-ray machine.4. ""Houdini Whodunit.""  While Houdini entertains at the Shaftesbury Theatre, a robbery next door at the Bank of Toronto claims a life.  And a witness claims he saw Houdini do it.  Introduces Dr. Ogden's glamourous younger sister.5. ""The Green Muse.""  A fire is set in Mrs. Weston's Music Academy, the town's classiest brothel, and a popular prostitute is found garroted.6. ""Shades of Grey.""  A lovely young woman is found naked, apparently drained of blood.  She'd been pregnant.  A particularly powerful episode to me.7. ""Big Murderer on Campus.""  There's crime among the toffs, as a university professor is shot on a lush and leafy campus.8. ""I, Murdoch."" Ezra Dolomore, a former professor and theoretical mathematician now employed in private industry, is killed in the street by a variant of that Russian KGB umbrella murder of a few years ago.  There's talk of early computers and industrial espionage; we see an early film projector, and meet a charming young boy, Alwyn Jones, and his beautiful widowed mother.9. ""Convalescence.""  An injured Murdoch must spend some time at home in his boarding house; his presence inconveniences some. Dr. Ogden and Mrs. Jones face off.10. ""[...].""  The corpse of a young woman is found, with her wrists cut. But it doesn't appear to be a suicide.  She was a telegraph operator; Murdoch discovers that the telegraph lines functioned as a kind of internet for those who worked in the trade.11. ""Let Us Ask the Maiden."" A young man collapses and dies while at prayer in a Jewish synagogue.  It was arsenic poisoning.  Was it a love triangle?12. ""Werewolves.""  A prominent banker is found dead in an abandoned foundry, his throat torn out; it seems almost as if wolves, or even werewolves, were the culprits.  Shines a light on the prejudice against Indians, Native Canadians if you will.13. ""Anything You Can Do.""  A light-hearted episode that introduces us to Murdoch's father, and another son of his, a Royal Canadian Mounted policeman, a Mountie.  Wild West touches, dead geologist, and considerations of oil.Unfortunately, aside from Craig as Inspector Brackenreid, the actors don't look or sound particularly Victorian, and Bisson, who plays the title character, is handsome enough, but somewhat wooden.  Never mind: the Toronto ""Globe and Mail"" has called this series ""smart, fast-paced fun."" That it is.  The episodes stand alone, and it's possible to enjoy Series Two without having seen the first series, but the first series does give us that little bit of introduction to the characters, and adds to the fun.",5,First-Rate Series Gets Better,1276992000,"06 20, 2010",2010,5545,"['Murdoch', 'Mysteries', 'Season', 'Two', 'strikes', 'British', 'mystery', 'set', 'Canada', 'Canadian', 'actors', 'have',

The characters get to deal with issues like the Temperance League and other issues of the day.

However, this detective is absolutely perfect and his powers of investigation are flawless. He's a young articulate good looking man so the director has the camera focused on him for about 80% of the showtime. Each change of scene is punctuated with something like a gun shot which helps to keep you from falling asleep during the 50 minute show. He invents gadgets that have not even been dreamt of in 1904 Toronto, e.g., night vision goggles; a minuscule steel ball injected into someone's leg by a blind man's cane resulting in instant death; etc. He is too perfect to be believable. I know, you say let your imagination fly and just enjoy the show but &#34;getting into&#34; this show is very difficult since almost every scene requires a giant leap of faith to make it slightly believable. The sound track (not music) and the gun shots between scenes are unbearable. HOWEVER, Helene Joy as Dr. Julia Ogden is an absolute joy to watch and she portrays a believable, likable character. She is not flawless and shows great humanity, sensitivity and she keeps this show going. Modern day topics like abortion, racial equality, gender equality, etc. are handled extremely well and the script writers, and creator Maureen Jennings, have to be complimented on this.",3,Absolutely Perfect Detective but With A Delightful Supporting Actress-Helene Joy.,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,1352,"['stories', 'are', 'good', 'dialogue', 'main', 'character', 'others', 'good', 'However', 'detective', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'powers', 'investigation', 'are', 'flawless', 'young', 'articulate', 'good', 'looking', 'man', 'director', 'camera', 'focused', 'about', '80', '%', 'showtime', 'change', 'scene', 'punctuated', 'something', 'gun', 'shot', 'keep', 'falling', 'asleep', '50', 'minute', 'show', 'gadgets', 'have', 'not', 'even', 'been', 'dreamt', '1904', 'Toronto', 'e.g.', 'night', 'vision', 'goggles', 'minuscule', 'steel', 'ball', 'injected', 'someone', 'leg', 'blind', 'man', 'cane', 'resulting', 'instant', 'death', 'etc', 'too', 'perfect', 'be', 'believable', 'know', 'say', 'let', 'imagination', 'fly', 'just', 'enjoy', 'show', '34', 'getting', '34', 'show', 'very', 'difficult', 'almost', 'scene', 'giant', 'leap', 'faith', 'make', 'slightly', 'believable', 'sound', 'track', 'not', 'music', 'gun', 'shots', 'scenes', 'are', 'unbearable', 'HOWEVER', 'Helene', 'Joy', 'Dr.', 'Julia', 'Ogden', 'absolute', 'joy', 'watch', 'believable', 'likable', 'character', 'not', 'flawless', 'great', 'humanity', 'sensitivity', 'show', 'going', 'Modern', 'day', 'topics', 'abortion', 'racial', 'equality', 'gender', 'equality', 'etc', 'are', 'handled', 'extremely', 'well', 'script', 'writers', 'creator', 'Maureen', 'Jennings', 'have', 'be', 'complimented']",N/A

I am drawn to the mystery, trying to guess who done it, the characters and what will become of them as the series continues, and am prepared to chuckle at some of the characters personalities.
