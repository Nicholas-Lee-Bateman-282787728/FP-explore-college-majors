I don't read much these days, so I am very grateful that Sarah Waters' brilliant books have been made into movies.

Elaine Cassidy and Sally Hawkins are the homely leading ladies in the melodrama based on the Sarah Waters novel. Imelda Staunton, more famous for the Harry Potter movies,stars as a conniving thief. Hawkins, like a Dickensian character, comes into her fortune when she meets an heiress (Cassidy). They realize their growing feelings for each other, despite the social conventions. Cassidy is an arranged marriage thanks to Hawkins and Staunton. She also has to deal with a cruel uncle (Charles Dance),who is basically making her read Victorian pr0n to his friends (that's a plot twist revealed later--and ironically, her character goes on to write erotica) There's betrayal,a love triangle,a convoluted plot. There's a constant atmosphere of gloom--be it in Cassidy's ominous manse or the grimy world of Hawkins. It's supposed to be gothic, but it's merely glum. ""Fingersmith"" is titillating only because of the lesbian romance--other than that,it's boring. It's definitely same-sex romance.",2,Forbidden Gothic Love,1252886400,"09 14, 2009",2009,1037,"['Fingersmith', 'Dickensian', 'Sapphic', 'romance', 'Elaine', 'Cassidy', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'are', 'homely', 'leading', 'ladies', 'melodrama', 'based', 'Sarah', 'Waters', 'novel', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'more', 'famous', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'stars', 'conniving', 'thief', 'Dickensian', 'character', 'fortune', 'when', 'heiress', 'Cassidy', 'realize', 'growing', 'feelings', 'other', 'social', 'conventions', 'Cassidy', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'thanks', 'Hawkins', 'Staunton', 'also', 'deal', 'cruel', 'uncle', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'who', 'basically', 'making', 'read', 'Victorian', 'pr0n', 'friends', 'plot', 'twist', 'revealed', 'later', 'ironically', 'character', 'write', 'erotica', 'betrayal', 'love', 'triangle', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'constant', 'atmosphere', 'gloom', 'be', 'Cassidy', 'ominous', 'manse', 'grimy', 'world', 'Hawkins', 'supposed', 'be', 'gothic', 'merely', 'glum', 'Fingersmith', 'titillating', 'only', 'lesbian', 'romance', 'other', 'boring', 'definitely', 'same-sex', 'romance']",N/A

In typical BBC fashion, the Victorian era sets and costumes are authentic, the camera work is artful, and the acting is superb.  Perhaps most importantly, the recreation is very faithful to the book.  The author of the novel, Sarah Waters, has an amazing talent for storytelling, suspense, and rich characterizations.  There are several revelations and twists in the plot that will really surprise you if you haven't read the book first.The casting and acting are mostly excellent, including the Oscar-nominated actress Imelda Staunton. I look forward to seeing more films by the two leading ladies, Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy, both of whom were believable and touching.My only complaint is the casting of Rupert Evans as Gentleman.  Having read the book, I pictured Gentleman a good ten years older than Evans.  Evans does not express the authority, complexity and ambivalence inherent in Gentleman's personality; his Gentleman is a youthful, one-dimensional villain.  Fortunately, the other performances and the production as a whole are strong enough that this failing did not detract from my overall appreciation of a very well-made, engrossing and heartfelt drama.",5,Top-Notch Entertainment,1130284800,"10 26, 2005",2005,1265,"['BBC', 'made-for-TV', 'two-parter', 'wonderful', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'typical', 'BBC', 'fashion', 'Victorian', 'era', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'authentic', 'camera', 'work', 'artful', 'acting', 'superb', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'importantly', 'recreation', 'very', 'faithful', 'book', 'author', 'novel', 'Sarah', 'Waters', 'amazing', 'talent', 'storytelling', 'suspense', 'rich', 'characterizations', 'are', 'several', 'revelations', 'twists', 'plot', 'will', 'really', 'surprise', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'first.The', 'casting', 'acting', 'are', 'mostly', 'excellent', 'including', 'Oscar-nominated', 'actress', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'films', 'two', 'leading', 'ladies', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'Elaine', 'Cassidy', 'whom', 'were', 'believable', 'only', 'complaint', 'casting', 'Rupert', 'Evans', 'Gentleman', 'Having', 'read', 'book', 'pictured', 'Gentleman', 'good', 'ten', 'years', 'older', 'Evans', 'Evans', 'not', 'express', 'authority', 'complexity', 'ambivalence', 'inherent', 'Gentleman', 'personality', 'Gentleman', 'youthful', 'one-dimensional', 'villain', 'Fortunately', 'other', 'performances', 'production', 'whole', 'are', 'strong', 'enough', 'failing', 'did', 'not', 'detract', 'overall', 'appreciation', 'very', 'well-made', 'engrossing', 'heartfelt', 'drama']",N/A

While a couple of scenes in the first half are indeed shot through with steamy woman-on-woman smooching, on the whole the Sapphic aspect of the story takes a back seat to other elements of the plot.So if you can get past the spectacle of kissing women, you've got quite a good film in store for you:  at times the acting is unbelievable; and the script is always fresh, convincing, and thoroughly unpredictable.There are two episodes, which must be separately loaded.  The first half features such a jaw-dropper at the end that you'll find yourself wishing you had watched the thing a lot more carefully!This is a BBC production set in London and environs about the time of the setting of Dicken's novels.

The film was a bit long and the pacing slow in parts, but overall the story was well developed and executed. The setting, sets and costumes were beautifully done.The two leads boldly played the two characters, and communicated the taboo that was their relationship as well as the struggle they experienced in overcoming their own restrictions and repression of the time. I have never read the book, but it appears that the screen adaptation was faithful, at least, in the impact it had, to the book.  The two parts of the film worked well in creating the mindset of each character for me, and allowed me to focus on one possibility of the chain of events, at a time. It also felt more epic because of this style of storytelling.While the story was detailed, and relatable for me, the leads sometimes overacted, which was a bit distracting for me.

I absolutely loved this book and was excited to see how it was carried out on the screen - since I haven't been too happy with page to screen adaptations lately.This movie is set in Victorian England. A young fingersmith (thief), Sue, goes in on a plot with a man to swindle money from a local heiress, Maud. Sue becomes Maud's maid while trying to help her fall into their plot. Sue's problem is that she has a conscience and feels bad about ruining the life of this girl whom she has befriended. When it comes time to conclude the plot and put Maud into the mad house - things get turned upside down and the swindle plan radically changes for all of the characters. The first half of the miniseries is seen from Sue's perspective and the second half is from Maud's perspective.This movie follows the plot of the book very closely. The book is broken down into sections narrated by Sue and by Maud, which the movie repeats. I am very thankful that the movie follows the plot of the book because the book is so well written.

921078,ABXBWSPM6YHAI,B000A4T804,"Rebecca Huston ""telynor""","[35, 36]","After reading Sarah Waters' novel Fingersmith, I knew I had to take a look at the film adaptation of the story. A BBC production from 2005 of this tale of double crosses and forbidden love does a credible job of making a believable transition to the screen.Set in London's underbelly in the 1860's, we see the world of Mrs. Sucksby (Imelda Staunton), a baby-farmer who takes in foundlings, and the materfamilias of a gang of thieves and a fence, Mr. Ibbs (David Troughton). In their little tribe of thieves -- or fingersmiths -- there is Sue Trinder (Sally Hawkins). Sue, unlike the other two thieves in the household, is rather cherished by Mrs. Sucksby, and has a privileged status as a sort of adopted daughter. Not that Sue is naive, mind you. She knows the rough and tumble ways of life at the bottom, but when a scheme is hatched by Gentleman (Rupert Evans) to defraud a gentlewoman, Sue is more than eager to join in the plot. After all, her take will be three thousand pounds, a goodly sum in that day and time.The gentlewoman in question is Maud Lilly (Elaine Cassidy), the niece of a landowner, Mr. Lilly (Charles Dance) in the countryside. Briar, as the estate is known, is a crumbling, dark and downright sinister place. With a rather unpleasant childhood, Maud finds a sort of sanctuary at Briar, treated as a lady, wearing fine clothing, but there is something rotten at the very bottom of Briar, where she entertains her uncle's guests by reading his massive collection of books to them, and helping her uncle catalog his books as a secretary.But then a young man appears in her life, Richard Rivers, young and charming and interested in Maud herself. He begs for her to marry him, to leave the dusty, dim world that her uncle inhabits, and know the freedom of London as his wife.But here too, not all is as it seems, for Rivers is none other than Gentleman, and he has plotted for Sue to become Maud's lady's-maid and friend, and so, have Maud committed to an lunatic asylum, and he will gain control of Maud's fortune, with Sue receiving a share...I really don't want to reveal more of the plot, as this is a story full of twists and turns, and some truly knockout punches. The emotional level in this film is high, but very believable, especially with the characters of Maud and Sue. The atmosphere is suitably dank and unnerving, but beautifully shot and directed by Aisling Walsh with Peter Ransley adapting the novel in the screenplay. While I had known what the story was going to be from reading the novel, I was hooked from the start, and followed eagerly along through the three-hour film, presented in two parts.Parents should note that this film has some fairly questionable material, dealing as it does with Victorian pornography, and the intense emotions between two women. Those who find this objectionable should not watch this, as while the scenes are tastefully done, they're not masking over any details either. The scenes in the asylum are also fairly graphic, along with visuals of two hangings.The DVD edition has some extras, with character overviews, a 'behind the scenes' featurette that has Sarah Waters speaking about her film, along with scene selections and a cast overview. The picture and sound quality are fairly crisp and clear.I give this one an enthusiastic thumbs-up. While the content matter is a bit much for most audiences, if you can handle a lesbian love affair that isn't glossed over or shown for titillation's sake, you'll like this one. I did have problems with Sue's character at first, but when the big twist comes, I guarantee that you'll become a bit more sympathetic for her.Happily recommended, with four solid stars.",4,"Intense, believable tale of an illicit relationship",1174348800,"03 20, 2007",2007,3683,"['reading', 'Sarah', 'Waters', 'novel', 'Fingersmith', 'knew', 'had', 'take', 'look', 'film', 'adaptation', 'story', 'BBC', 'production', '2005', 'tale', 'double', 'crosses', 'forbidden', 'love', 'credible', 'job', 'making', 'believable', 'transition', 'screen.Set', 'London', 'underbelly', '1860', 'see', 'world', 'Mrs.', 'Sucksby', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'baby-farmer', 'who', 'foundlings', 'materfamilias', 'gang', 'thieves', 'fence', 'Mr.', 'Ibbs', 'David', 'Troughton', 'little', 'tribe', 'thieves', 'fingersmiths', 'Sue', 'Trinder', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'Sue', 'other', 'two', 'thieves', 'household', 'rather', 'cherished', 'Mrs.', 'Sucksby', 'privileged', 'status', 'sort', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'Not', 'Sue', 'naive', 'mind', 'rough', 'tumble', 'ways', 'life', 'bottom', 'when', 'scheme', 'hatched', 'Gentleman', 'Rupert', 'Evans', 'defraud', 'gentlewoman', 'Sue', 'more', 'eager', 'join', 'plot', 'take', 'will', 'be', 'three', 'thousand', 'pounds', 'goodly', 'sum', 'day', 'time.The', 'gentlewoman', 'question', 'Maud', 'Lilly', 'Elaine', 'Cassidy', 'niece', 'landowner', 'Mr.', 'Lilly', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'countryside', 'Briar', 'estate', 'known', 'crumbling', 'dark', 'downright', 'sinister', 'place', 'rather', 'unpleasant', 'childhood', 'Maud', 'sort', 'sanctuary', 'Briar', 'treated', 'lady', 'wearing', 'fine', 'clothing', 'something', 'rotten', 'very', 'bottom', 'Briar', 'where', 'uncle', 'guests', 'reading', 'massive', 'collection', 'books', 'helping', 'uncle', 'catalog', 'books', 'secretary.But', 'then', 'young', 'man', 'life', 'Richard', 'Rivers', 'young', 'charming', 'interested', 'Maud', 'marry', 'leave', 'dusty', 'dim', 'world', 'uncle', 'inhabits', 'know', 'freedom', 'London', 'wife.But', 'here', 'too', 'not', 'Rivers', 'none', 'other', 'Gentleman', 'plotted', 'Sue', 'become', 'Maud', ""lady's-maid"", 'friend', 'so', 'have', 'Maud', 'committed', 'lunatic', 'asylum', 'will', 'gain', 'control', 'Maud', 'fortune', 'Sue', 'receiving', 'share', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'reveal', 'more', 'plot', 'story', 'full', 'twists', 'turns', 'truly', 'knockout', 'punches', 'emotional', 'level', 'film', 'high', 'very', 'believable', 'especially', 'characters', 'Maud', 'Sue', 'atmosphere', 'suitably', 'dank', 'unnerving', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'directed', 'Aisling', 'Walsh', 'Peter', 'Ransley', 'adapting', 'novel', 'screenplay', 'had', 'known', 'what', 'story', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'reading', 'novel', 'was', 'hooked', 'start', 'followed', 'eagerly', 'along', 'three-hour', 'film', 'presented', 'two', 'parts.Parents', 'should', 'note', 'film', 'fairly', 'questionable', 'material', 'dealing', 'Victorian', 'pornography', 'intense', 'emotions', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'find', 'objectionable', 'should', 'not', 'watch', 'scenes', 'are', 'tastefully', 'done', ""'re"", 'not', 'masking', 'details', 'scenes', 'asylum', 'are', 'also', 'fairly', 'graphic', 'visuals', 'two', 'hangings.The', 'DVD', 'edition', 'extras', 'character', 'overviews', ""'behind"", 'scenes', 'featurette', 'Sarah', 'Waters', 'speaking', 'film', 'scene', 'selections', 'cast', 'overview', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'fairly', 'crisp', 'clear.I', 'give', 'one', 'enthusiastic', 'thumbs-up', 'content', 'matter', 'bit', 'much', 'most', 'audiences', 'can', 'handle', 'lesbian', 'love', 'affair', ""n't"", 'glossed', 'over', 'shown', 'titillation', 'sake', ""'ll"", 'like', 'one', 'did', 'have', 'problems', 'Sue', 'character', 'first', 'when', 'big', 'twist', 'guarantee', ""'ll"", 'become', 'bit', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'her.Happily', 'recommended', 'four', 'solid', 'stars']",N/A
921079,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000A4T804,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 2]","Fingersmith (Aisling Walsh, 2005)Fingersmith, actually a two-part British TV miniseries, came to America as a three-hour DVD. Based on Sarah Waters' novel of the same name, it details the dealings of Susan Smith (Sally Hawkins, recently of The Painted Veil), a thief (thus the title) in London in the nineteenth century who becomes involved in a complicated scheme to swindle a large sum of money out of Maud Lilly (The Others' Elaine Cassidy). Smith, through a series of intrigues, becomes Lilly's handmaiden, but the two of them quickly develop a friendship on top of that, and possibly something more (I haven't read the novel, so I don't know if it's explicit there; it's certainly implied here). The trick is, there's a great deal more to Maud Lilly than anyone realizes; once you hit the halfway point, the surprises here come thick and fast, and what looked to be a simple crime story blossoms into an all-out mystery/thriller that I was in no way expecting. And what a pleasant surprise it is.It helps, of course, that both Hawkins and Cassidy are almost painfully beautiful, and that, plus the script's implications as to their relationship, certainly helps propel the first half of the film, which is half crime story and half Merchant/Ivory comedy of manners (a genre of film to which I have never been able to warm myself). At the halfway point, though, I stopped noticing, and for someone like me, that's saying something. How many red herrings can you throw into one script? How many little side perversions can you add without things becoming too overloaded for anyone to see your plot? How many twists and turns, how many character revelations, the whole bit? Yes, it does end up playing the Vitorian-melodrama card so loved by writers like Nathaniel Hawthorne (I heard a pretty strong echo of the last line of House of the Seven Gables in the last few minutes of this film, though it's not quite as deus ex machina as Hawthorne allowed himself; still, it's awfully convenient), but it's such an enchanting thrill ride getting there I actually didn't half mind.  There's a great deal of fun to be had here, even if you're not a big fan of Victorian costume drama; a very entertaining little film, well worth watching. *** ",4,A mystery within a puzzle wrapped inside an enigma...,1212105600,"05 30, 2008",2008,2238,"['Fingersmith', 'Aisling', 'Walsh', '2005', 'Fingersmith', 'actually', 'two-part', 'British', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'came', 'America', 'three-hour', 'DVD', 'Based', 'Sarah', 'Waters', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'details', 'dealings', 'Susan', 'Smith', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'recently', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'thief', 'thus', 'title', 'London', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'who', 'involved', 'complicated', 'scheme', 'swindle', 'large', 'sum', 'money', 'Maud', 'Lilly', 'Others', 'Elaine', 'Cassidy', 'Smith', 'series', 'intrigues', 'Lilly', 'handmaiden', 'two', 'quickly', 'develop', 'friendship', 'top', 'possibly', 'something', 'more', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'novel', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'explicit', 'there', 'certainly', 'implied', 'here', 'trick', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'Maud', 'Lilly', 'anyone', 'once', 'hit', 'halfway', 'point', 'surprises', 'here', 'come', 'thick', 'fast', 'what', 'looked', 'be', 'simple', 'crime', 'story', 'blossoms', 'all-out', 'mystery/thriller', 'was', 'way', 'expecting', 'what', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'course', 'Hawkins', 'Cassidy', 'are', 'almost', 'painfully', 'beautiful', 'script', 'implications', 'relationship', 'certainly', 'propel', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'half', 'crime', 'story', 'half', 'Merchant/Ivory', 'comedy', 'manners', 'genre', 'film', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'warm', 'halfway', 'point', 'stopped', 'noticing', 'someone', 'saying', 'something', 'How', 'many', 'red', 'herrings', 'can', 'throw', 'one', 'script', 'How', 'many', 'little', 'side', 'perversions', 'can', 'add', 'things', 'becoming', 'too', 'overloaded', 'anyone', 'see', 'plot', 'How', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'how', 'many', 'character', 'revelations', 'whole', 'bit', 'Yes', 'end', 'up', 'playing', 'Vitorian-melodrama', 'card', 'so', 'loved', 'writers', 'Nathaniel', 'Hawthorne', 'heard', 'pretty', 'strong', 'echo', 'last', 'line', 'House', 'Seven', 'Gables', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'not', 'quite', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'Hawthorne', 'allowed', 'still', 'awfully', 'convenient', 'such', 'enchanting', 'thrill', 'ride', 'getting', 'there', 'actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'half', 'mind', 'great', 'deal', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'here', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Victorian', 'costume', 'drama', 'very', 'entertaining', 'little', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', '***']",N/A
