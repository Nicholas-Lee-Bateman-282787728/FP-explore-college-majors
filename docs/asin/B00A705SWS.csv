1606219,A3UJM7P1QAX7DC,B00A705SWS,"Lesmiz junkie ""Musical fiend""","[3, 4]","For those like me who prefer to have the DVD, this does come with the spoken Korean and the subtitles in English.I first want it realized that a large part of my interest in this film is that I lived in Seoul when the true tragedy took place.  In 1995, a large department store did cave in and a colleague of mine survived.With that preface in mind, I would recommend the film to someone who is interested in Korean culture.  Otherwise, it might be difficult for some viewers to get through the exposition of the first 20-30 minutes.However, once the main character starts his journey to reconnect with the love he lost, I feel most viewers will be drawn in.  I don't want to give away too many spoilers but the young man's journey starts out alone.  He feels solitary in his grief.It is through following his vacation itinerary that he meets a woman with whom he connects.  Her life intertwines with his in a way neither would have expected.She also is trying to recover from the department store tragedy but from the perspective of a survivor.  They share a connection in common about that day beyond expectation.The film shows some of the most beautiful places in South Korea outside the hustle and bustle of the big cities.The acting and direction are very good.The film is sad and touching but it does offer the opportunity of hope after an enormous loss for the main characters.  That theme is perhaps a positive message for humanity in general.",5,Touching fictional film based on a real tragedy,1377388800,"08 25, 2013",2013,1451,"['who', 'prefer', 'have', 'DVD', 'come', 'spoken', 'Korean', 'subtitles', 'English.I', 'first', 'want', 'realized', 'large', 'part', 'interest', 'film', 'lived', 'Seoul', 'when', 'true', 'tragedy', 'took', 'place', '1995', 'large', 'department', 'store', 'did', 'cave', 'colleague', 'mine', 'survived.With', 'preface', 'mind', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'someone', 'who', 'interested', 'Korean', 'culture', 'Otherwise', 'might', 'be', 'difficult', 'viewers', 'get', 'exposition', 'first', '20-30', 'minutes.However', 'once', 'main', 'character', 'journey', 'reconnect', 'love', 'lost', 'feel', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'drawn', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'many', 'spoilers', 'young', 'man', 'journey', 'out', 'alone', 'solitary', 'grief.It', 'following', 'vacation', 'itinerary', 'woman', 'whom', 'life', 'intertwines', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'expected.She', 'also', 'trying', 'recover', 'department', 'store', 'tragedy', 'perspective', 'survivor', 'share', 'connection', 'common', 'day', 'expectation.The', 'film', 'most', 'beautiful', 'places', 'South', 'Korea', 'hustle', 'bustle', 'big', 'cities.The', 'acting', 'direction', 'are', 'very', 'good.The', 'film', 'sad', 'touching', 'offer', 'opportunity', 'hope', 'enormous', 'loss', 'main', 'characters', 'theme', 'perhaps', 'positive', 'message', 'humanity', 'general']",Traces of Love
1606220,A3GAPRFAGVV6PK,B00A705SWS,"L. L. Broberg ""Truth Seeker""","[5, 6]","I didn't expect this to be as sad as it was. Not all the way through, but in places it was. I don't want to give anything away that might spoil it for anyone, but if you get emotionally involved in movies, you should have some tissues handy for this one.I'm finding, with these Korean movies, that I prefer the slower, more thoughtful ones, like this one. I've watched others that had characters who were just too jarring and annoying and loud...and for me, I can't stand that. But, none of that in this one.It might be a little too slow for some, as the story does take awhile to develop, but I found it to be more reflective of real life in that way.I also thought the subtitles were good, as sometimes I find them confusing or they're not on the screen long enough. I thought these were just right. Of course, the dialogue isn't flying around really fast, so perhaps that's why.  :)  Not that I can't read fast, it's just that with some of them the subtitles fly by so fast that I can't tell what's actually happening.Anyway, nice quiet movie for a nice quiet afternoon. :)",5,Make sure you have a tissue or two on hand,1366848000,"04 25, 2013",2013,1076,"['did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'as', 'sad', 'was', 'Not', 'way', 'places', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'might', 'spoil', 'anyone', 'get', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'movies', 'should', 'have', 'tissues', 'handy', 'one.I', ""'m"", 'finding', 'Korean', 'movies', 'prefer', 'slower', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'ones', 'one', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'others', 'had', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'jarring', 'annoying', 'loud', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'none', 'one.It', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'slow', 'story', 'take', 'awhile', 'develop', 'found', 'be', 'more', 'reflective', 'real', 'life', 'way.I', 'also', 'thought', 'subtitles', 'were', 'good', 'sometimes', 'find', 'confusing', ""'re"", 'not', 'screen', 'long', 'enough', 'thought', 'were', 'just', 'right', 'course', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'flying', 'around', 'really', 'fast', 'so', 'perhaps', 'why', 'Not', 'ca', ""n't"", 'read', 'fast', 'just', 'subtitles', 'fly', 'fast', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'actually', 'happening.Anyway', 'nice', 'quiet', 'movie', 'nice', 'quiet', 'afternoon']",Traces of Love

In a way that may have helped since we are following the journey of a man who loses the woman he loves and how he comes to deal with it.
