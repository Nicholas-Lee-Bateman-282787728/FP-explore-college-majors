The story of Little Dorrit is told first from the perspective of her hero and in the end her husband. The it is retold from Dorrit's perspective. Both versions of the story are superbly told, but what a difference. Truth, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder!I can't recommend this marvelous production too highly. It's just unfortunate that it's only available in PAL, so I had to watch it on my laptop. Perhaps someday it will be released with a universal (0) coding for everyone to enjoy.",5,Dickens' Little Dorrit from two distinct perspectives,1381881600,"10 16, 2013",2013,601,"['something', 'Wilkie', 'Collins', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'Dickens', 'initial', 'disapproval', 'eventual', 'admiration', 'story', 'Little', 'Dorrit', 'told', 'first', 'perspective', 'hero', 'end', 'husband', 'retold', 'Dorrit', 'perspective', 'versions', 'story', 'are', 'superbly', 'told', 'what', 'difference', 'Truth', 'beauty', 'eye', 'beholder', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'marvelous', 'production', 'too', 'highly', 'just', 'unfortunate', 'only', 'available', 'PAL', 'had', 'watch', 'laptop', 'Perhaps', 'someday', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'universal', '0', 'coding', 'everyone', 'enjoy']",Little Dorrit 1987

Biehl ""GEOMILO""","[6, 6]","I am fortunate enough to have this on laser disc and while it may not be up to new DVD standards, the quality is still far better than VHS. I would definitely buy a restored DVD issue when it becomes available. I loved this version. I just watched the newer BBC version on PBS. Overall it was very well done but I thought it did a poor job explaining the ""mystery"" at the conclusion. We had friends that could not figure out who was related to whom at the end, and I have heard that PBS received tons of e-mails asking for clarification. It almost came across as if Arthur and Amy were step brother and sister.",4,Little Dorrit,1240963200,"04 29, 2009",2009,610,"['am', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'have', 'laser', 'disc', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'up', 'new', 'DVD', 'standards', 'quality', 'still', 'far', 'better', 'VHS', 'would', 'definitely', 'buy', 'restored', 'DVD', 'issue', 'when', 'available', 'loved', 'version', 'just', 'watched', 'newer', 'BBC', 'version', 'PBS', 'Overall', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'thought', 'did', 'poor', 'job', 'explaining', 'mystery', 'conclusion', 'had', 'friends', 'could', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'was', 'related', 'whom', 'end', 'have', 'heard', 'PBS', 'received', 'tons', 'e-mails', 'asking', 'clarification', 'almost', 'came', 'Arthur', 'Amy', 'were', 'step', 'brother', 'sister']",Little Dorrit 1987
1175676,AAXXE7X01EPR1,B001CD3POM,L. A Leporati,"[5, 8]","When this film (or should I say films) came out in 1988, the New York City art house theatre that was showing it did something unusual.  You could buy tickets for either movie (and see them on separate days) or you could buy tickets for both (at a discounted price) and watch the whole story in one day.  I opted for the one-day marathon.  Part 1 ran from 10:00am - 1:00.  You then had an hour and a half to go out and grab a bite of lunch.  Part 2 started at 2:30 - 5:30pm.  As other reviewers have stated, this is a beautifully filmed, detailed and magnificently acted story.  Since there is a great deal going on it does require your full attention to detail and storyline.  One wonders if they could get away with making a film like this today.  At 6 hours in length, they were only able to have one showing a day.  It certainly wouldn't be a moneymaker!",5,Magnificent!,1238716800,"04 3, 2009",2009,858,"['When', 'film', 'should', 'say', 'films', 'came', 'out', '1988', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'art', 'house', 'theatre', 'was', 'showing', 'did', 'something', 'unusual', 'could', 'buy', 'tickets', 'movie', 'see', 'separate', 'days', 'could', 'buy', 'tickets', 'discounted', 'price', 'watch', 'whole', 'story', 'one', 'day', 'opted', 'one-day', 'marathon', 'Part', '1', 'ran', '10:00am', '1:00', 'then', 'had', 'hour', 'half', 'go', 'out', 'grab', 'bite', 'lunch', 'Part', '2', 'started', '2:30', '5:30pm', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'detailed', 'magnificently', 'acted', 'story', 'great', 'deal', 'going', 'require', 'full', 'attention', 'detail', 'storyline', 'One', 'wonders', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'making', 'film', 'today', '6', 'hours', 'length', 'were', 'only', 'able', 'have', 'one', 'showing', 'day', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'moneymaker']",Little Dorrit 1987
