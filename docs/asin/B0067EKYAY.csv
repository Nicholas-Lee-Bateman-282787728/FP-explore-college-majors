1511365,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0067EKYAY,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Even though I enjoyed watching Taken 2 tonight, the truth is it's *extremely* similar to the first Taken.  Only because I'm such a huge fan of high octane action films such as this one will I give in and award the movie 4 stars.  It's realistically more like a 3-star film.  Anyway it stars the always talented Liam Neeson doing exactly what he did in the first Taken- chasing bad guys around with guns and his fists, and specifically and strategically planning the best ways to instruct his daughter to avoid being captured by the kidnappers.  Liam's daughter and wife play larger roles in the storyline this time around (at least the daughter does- the wife is basically spending her time being a helpless captured victim).I have to be honest.  Even though Liam coming up with these carefully planned directions to either guide his daughter to safety or help him escape where he's being held/captured, I have to laugh at how unrealistically sharp and skilled he is at his technique.  It's unintentionally really funny to me how he never misses a beat when explaining what to do and where to go.  I wasn't laughing in the first movie when Liam did the same thing perhaps due to his character being really believable and just plain good, but now it seems really funny for some reason.  Probably means Taken wasn't meant to have a sequel and segments such as these weren't meant to occur ever again.  That way we could preserve the greatness of the original Taken and recognize it as one of Liam's highest achievements as an actor.  The sequel kind of ruins what made the first one so great.What seems particularly odd about Taken 2 however, is all the storyline segments concerning Liam's daughter.  She doesn't want to drive, she doesn't have the confidence to pass her driving test, and she doesn't believe she's good enough at parellel parking, however all these issues magically go away just as soon as she's forced to speed away from the gun-carrying kidnappers.  Suddenly her driving abilities improve dramatically (with a couple exceptions).  It's odd writing.  It's almost like her driving problems never should have been included in the script and were only included because the writers couldn't think of another way to make her character memorable.  Also, it's hilarious that she doesn't hesitate to pull pins from grenades and toss them across the street (a fairly clever piece of writing here, though probably not realistic but I could be wrong- you'll see why when you watch the movie).  Basically Liam is using the sound and the amount of seconds that passes after the grenade explosion to figure out where he's being captured.  His daughter is able execute these instructions without feeling any fear which is odd.This movie is also a victim of camera jerking during the action scenes, which means when Liam is running around beating people up, we don't really see it- all we see is the camera jerking all over the place.  I can't recall if the originl was guilty of this same noticeable flaw.  I strongly dislike when movies ruin the action scenes with quick camera movements.  Also the writing in several spots is incredibly cliched.

I know he was a Jedi knight at one point, but that was the movie that made it real. The story was compelling, the action amazing, and the entire thing was a thrill ride. While the story this time out is very unique (the relatives of some of the men he killed in the first film are out for revenge) and I loved where it came from, the execution of the whole thing faltered horribly.While ""Taken 2"" will not let you lose faith in Liam Neeson's ability to kill a man creatively with his bare hands, the director this time out seems to take it as a personal challenge to change camera angles as many times as humanly possible during any action sequence. As a result, any time Liam is talking to someone, it's all calm and steady. The instant he moves toward a person to attack, the director takes the movie into an angle frenzy that lets you know there's a lot of action going on, but you'll never know what it is. It looks as if they didn't want to bother choreographing the fight scenes, so instead they just had Liam jerk around a bit and threw the camera into all sort of close-ups of elbows, shirts, fists, and such with sound effects. During a car chase scene, I counted 65 different camera angle changes in one minute, some lasting just a half a second close-up of a steering wheel, foot on the gas, etc. It's deplorable. At one point, Liam puts his hand on a guy's face and the guy dies, making it appear Liam killed him by sheer willpower.

Also, a fair number of people in the background of some scenes got away without so much as an elbow to the throat (what kind of message is that sending to our children???). And worst of all the action scenes are shot like an abstract European art film, asking you to ponder random blurry shots of elbows and the backs of heads as they fly through the frame. It's almost as if they're trying to get us to reflect on our increasingly dull familiarity with violence; the scenes blur into an incomprehensible flurry of meaningless carnage individually as well as collectively, leading the viewer to ask, ""why?""

1511392,A1K2ZXT12U5RQK,B0067EKYAY,Cameron Pietrafeso,"[0, 0]","The main plot idea was perfectly reasonable if not a little predicable.  Shortly after Taken 1 the family of the Albanian mobsters that were previously killed go out for revenge and this time the whole family is involved.  It was a mindless action flick, and I wasn't bored while watching it.  Unfortunately this sequel lacked a lot of what made the first one good enough to warrant a sequel in the first place.Firstly, I found the settings very limited.  Where the first movie felt like it ranged all over Paris, with LN having to work for every clue, this one just had LN chasing someone down one dirty ally or hallway after another.  The action scenes also followed the recent trend of shaking the camera like a martini and shooting disjointed and unrelated things to add a sense of action, then over-using jump cuts to splice the mess back together.A lot of the plot specifics didn't add up or were too convenient to be believable.  I won't ruin it by running them down specifically here.  Let's just say that unless you think a teenager can drive a cab though barricades and several 50 caliber machine guns to break into a US embassy, an LA girl struggling for normalcy that just narrowly escaped sex-slavery in France will want to travel to Istanbul to ""get away"", or villains will always do the cliche ""I'm just going to leave you alone now in a locked room by yourself even though I know you've single-handily killed all my previous men"" then you might have plot issues with this movie too.One last nit-pick...who ever directed the lighting of this movie must have thought all of Istanbul uses cheap, dim, green-casting florescent lights inside.Other than all that LN and FJ were good as always, and it was nice FJ had a bigger role in this one.  I just wish I had waiting for the rental to be cheaper or to go free/prime before I watched it, and unlike the first one, I probably won't be watching this one again ever.",3,So-So Story But Not Directing,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,1926,"['main', 'plot', 'idea', 'was', 'perfectly', 'reasonable', 'not', 'little', 'predicable', 'Shortly', 'Taken', '1', 'family', 'Albanian', 'mobsters', 'were', 'previously', 'killed', 'go', 'out', 'revenge', 'time', 'whole', 'family', 'involved', 'was', 'mindless', 'action', 'flick', 'was', ""n't"", 'bored', 'watching', 'Unfortunately', 'sequel', 'lacked', 'lot', 'what', 'made', 'first', 'one', 'good', 'enough', 'warrant', 'sequel', 'first', 'place.Firstly', 'found', 'settings', 'very', 'limited', 'Where', 'first', 'movie', 'felt', 'ranged', 'Paris', 'LN', 'having', 'work', 'clue', 'one', 'just', 'had', 'LN', 'chasing', 'someone', 'down', 'one', 'dirty', 'ally', 'hallway', 'action', 'scenes', 'also', 'followed', 'recent', 'trend', 'shaking', 'camera', 'martini', 'shooting', 'disjointed', 'unrelated', 'things', 'add', 'sense', 'action', 'then', 'over-using', 'jump', 'cuts', 'splice', 'mess', 'back', 'together.A', 'lot', 'plot', 'specifics', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'were', 'too', 'convenient', 'be', 'believable', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'running', 'down', 'specifically', 'here', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'think', 'teenager', 'can', 'drive', 'cab', 'barricades', 'several', '50', 'caliber', 'machine', 'guns', 'break', 'US', 'embassy', 'LA', 'girl', 'struggling', 'normalcy', 'just', 'narrowly', 'escaped', 'sex-slavery', 'France', 'will', 'want', 'travel', 'Istanbul', 'get', 'away', 'villains', 'will', 'always', 'do', 'cliche', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'leave', 'alone', 'now', 'locked', 'room', 'even', 'know', ""'ve"", 'single-handily', 'killed', 'previous', 'men', 'then', 'might', 'have', 'plot', 'issues', 'movie', 'too.One', 'last', 'nit-pick', 'who', 'ever', 'directed', 'lighting', 'movie', 'must', 'have', 'thought', 'Istanbul', 'cheap', 'dim', 'green-casting', 'florescent', 'lights', 'inside.Other', 'LN', 'FJ', 'were', 'good', 'always', 'was', 'nice', 'FJ', 'had', 'bigger', 'role', 'one', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'waiting', 'rental', 'be', 'cheaper', 'go', 'free/prime', 'watched', 'first', 'one', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'watching', 'one', 'again', 'ever']",N/A

1511403,A3UDINCZ3FASOS,B0067EKYAY,CBlaze,"[0, 0]","There are two types of sequels in Hollywood - the ones that get made because there's more story to tell and the ones that get made because the first film made a lot of money. At first Taken seemed like it was getting a sequel because it made a bunch of money - but in fact Taken 2 had a good enough idea behind it that I felt there was easily more good story to be told. With the premise of the families of the bad guys in the first film going on an offensive to get back at Bryan Mills was excellent! This premise gives both sides of the conflict the same motivation of protecting their families - which is universal and pretty cool for an action film premise.The problem is with Mills' entire family in peril - the director keeps the viewer in touch with the family throughout - so we lose that sense of urgency that the first film provided. In the first film we don't see his daughter after she's kidnapped - and it's intense throughout the film because we don't know what's happening to his daughter. This lack of suspense really takes one of the best elements that made the first film such a hit and replaces it with action sequences which suffer due to the lack of urgency and suspense. It's a big problem - there should've been another element added to replace the lack of suspense problem - as just action cannot fix this.FYI - This paragraph has nothing to do with the movie itself. I think - the bad guys should've just hired another assassin to get Mills and have it become more of a Die Hard, Bourne film cat and mouse game between Mills and an equally talented bad guy. We would've known Mills could win - but since we hadn't already seen him succeed in this kidnap scenario before the intensity needed to be amped up in a different way by taking Mills out of his element a bit. They need someone who can challenge Bryan Mills' level of preparedness so the viewer could feel like they are seeing something worth the ""certain set of skills"" Mills has.Anyway - the action was good (not great) Luc Besson knows how to orchestrate a good action film and Olivier Megaton is a solid director for action films - the pacing felt a little stop-start but it wasn't egregious. Overall the film lacked what could've been a great sequel based on the story needing to be expanded and made it feel like a sequel that was out for more cash.The bar was set high - by surprisingly excellent action romp that was Taken and Taken 2 (like many Eastern European thugs) got its head bashed into the bar by Liam Neeson.",3,I will hunt you down (again) and I will kill you (again),1360540800,"02 11, 2013",2013,2508,"['are', 'two', 'types', 'sequels', 'Hollywood', 'ones', 'get', 'made', 'more', 'story', 'tell', 'ones', 'get', 'made', 'first', 'film', 'made', 'lot', 'money', 'first', 'Taken', 'seemed', 'was', 'getting', 'sequel', 'made', 'bunch', 'money', 'fact', 'Taken', '2', 'had', 'good', 'enough', 'idea', 'felt', 'was', 'easily', 'more', 'good', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'premise', 'families', 'bad', 'guys', 'first', 'film', 'going', 'offensive', 'get', 'back', 'Bryan', 'Mills', 'was', 'excellent', 'premise', 'sides', 'conflict', 'same', 'motivation', 'protecting', 'families', 'universal', 'pretty', 'cool', 'action', 'film', 'premise.The', 'problem', 'Mills', 'entire', 'family', 'peril', 'director', 'viewer', 'touch', 'family', 'lose', 'sense', 'urgency', 'first', 'film', 'provided', 'first', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'daughter', 'kidnapped', 'intense', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happening', 'daughter', 'lack', 'suspense', 'really', 'one', 'best', 'elements', 'made', 'first', 'film', 'hit', 'replaces', 'action', 'sequences', 'suffer', 'due', 'lack', 'urgency', 'suspense', 'big', 'problem', 'there', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'element', 'added', 'replace', 'lack', 'suspense', 'problem', 'just', 'action', 'can', 'not', 'fix', 'this.FYI', 'paragraph', 'nothing', 'do', 'movie', 'think', 'bad', 'guys', 'should', ""'ve"", 'just', 'hired', 'assassin', 'get', 'Mills', 'have', 'more', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Bourne', 'film', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'Mills', 'equally', 'talented', 'bad', 'guy', 'would', ""'ve"", 'known', 'Mills', 'could', 'win', 'had', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'succeed', 'kidnap', 'scenario', 'intensity', 'needed', 'be', 'amped', 'up', 'different', 'way', 'taking', 'Mills', 'element', 'bit', 'need', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'challenge', 'Bryan', 'Mills', 'level', 'preparedness', 'viewer', 'could', 'feel', 'are', 'seeing', 'something', 'certain', 'set', 'skills', 'Mills', 'has.Anyway', 'action', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'how', 'orchestrate', 'good', 'action', 'film', 'Olivier', 'Megaton', 'solid', 'director', 'action', 'films', 'pacing', 'felt', 'little', 'stop-start', 'was', ""n't"", 'egregious', 'film', 'lacked', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great', 'sequel', 'based', 'story', 'needing', 'be', 'expanded', 'made', 'feel', 'sequel', 'was', 'out', 'more', 'cash.The', 'bar', 'was', 'set', 'high', 'surprisingly', 'excellent', 'action', 'romp', 'was', 'Taken', 'Taken', '2', 'many', 'Eastern', 'European', 'thugs', 'got', 'head', 'bashed', 'bar', 'Liam', 'Neeson']",N/A

I did not see this movie in the movie theater so I was interested to see how it would hold up to the original.I have to say that the movie was definitely action-packed, low the beginning was a little bit cheesy with the build up to the action itself, but once the characters got to Istanbul, the actual action ramped up very quickly. It is believed definitely get to know Bryan Mill's (Liam Neeson) family much more than you did in the first. Did you get to see Liam Neeson's character doing what he does best, working alone, and taking no prisoners. Liam Neeson does a great job in his role and in some cases saves the film.There are some great action scenes in the movie, and definitely some far-fetched things as well but all in all the movie was well made, this photography was great and the overall story itself was pretty good. The only part of the movie that was a bit far-fetched me was when Bryan Mills and his wife were kidnapped, the car scene makes it seem like they go much farther than they actually do and Mills is able to discern through his amazing CIA training where he is through the explosions of a few grenades ( which is pretty cool but a bit far-fetched).I am not saying that the movie was bad in any sense there are some great action scenes and the acting is fairly strong.

1511453,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B0067EKYAY,DanD,"[1, 1]","2008's TAKEN was a breath of fresh air: an action film that didn't take itself too seriously, but at the same time wasn't necessarily an homage or parody.  It presented Liam Neeson as an unlikely action hero: where he had previously seemed tall and gangly, now he was broad-shouldered and menacing, a force to be reckoned with.  And thanks to Neeson's charisma, his everyman Bryan Mills shined brightly enough to eclipse any non-PC ethics his role may have raised (Daddy is always right, and little girls should not go abroad without male protection).Well, if you liked TAKEN, you'll like TAKEN 2...because it's basically the exact same thing.  Minus a star for originality; let's face it, that's a given.  Minus half a star for a rather uninteresting premise: the father of one of the victims from the first film decides to kidnap Mills's family in revenge.  He gets Mills and his ex Lenore (Famke Janssen, returning); however, he misses daughter Kim (Maggie Grace, also back), and as such he underestimates how some traits run in the family.  When Mills gets free (come on, you know he does) , he races the clock to retrieve his wife and dispense justice...or vengeance.  The film doesn't care what you call it.Sound skeptical?  Well of course it is.  TAKEN required you to suspend your disbelief for a while, and just accept the fact that Mills had ""a certain set of skills"" that gave him Godlike powers.  TAKEN 2 asks you to throw your disbelief out the window and just go with it.  And you do, largely because Maggie Grace is given a lot more screen time; she goes from being the victim to a real player, a strong female role that the series desperately needed.  Neeson is still in fine form, of course; never doubt his screen presence.  It's the wholly implausible script, and frantic direction, that ultimately bog the film down.  However, for fans of the first, TAKEN 2 is a nice addition.  Perhaps not required viewing, but damned if it isn't a decent thrill ride.",3,3.5 Stars: It's the exact same thing...which isn't a bad thing.,1358121600,"01 14, 2013",2013,1973,"['2008', 'TAKEN', 'was', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'action', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'same', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'homage', 'parody', 'presented', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'unlikely', 'action', 'hero', 'where', 'had', 'previously', 'seemed', 'tall', 'gangly', 'now', 'was', 'broad-shouldered', 'menacing', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'thanks', 'Neeson', 'charisma', 'everyman', 'Bryan', 'Mills', 'shined', 'brightly', 'enough', 'eclipse', 'non-PC', 'ethics', 'role', 'may', 'have', 'raised', 'Daddy', 'always', 'right', 'little', 'girls', 'should', 'not', 'go', 'abroad', 'male', 'protection', '.Well', 'liked', 'TAKEN', ""'ll"", 'like', 'TAKEN', '2', 'basically', 'exact', 'same', 'thing', 'star', 'originality', 'let', 'face', 'given', 'Minus', 'star', 'rather', 'uninteresting', 'premise', 'father', 'one', 'victims', 'first', 'film', 'decides', 'kidnap', 'Mills', 'family', 'revenge', 'Mills', 'ex', 'Lenore', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'returning', 'however', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'also', 'back', 'such', 'how', 'traits', 'run', 'family', 'When', 'Mills', 'free', 'come', 'know', 'clock', 'retrieve', 'wife', 'dispense', 'justice', 'vengeance', 'film', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'call', 'it.Sound', 'skeptical', 'Well', 'course', 'TAKEN', 'required', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'while', 'just', 'accept', 'fact', 'Mills', 'had', 'certain', 'set', 'skills', 'gave', 'Godlike', 'powers', '2', 'throw', 'disbelief', 'window', 'just', 'go', 'do', 'largely', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'given', 'lot', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'being', 'victim', 'real', 'player', 'strong', 'female', 'role', 'series', 'desperately', 'needed', 'Neeson', 'still', 'fine', 'form', 'course', 'never', 'doubt', 'screen', 'presence', 'wholly', 'implausible', 'script', 'frantic', 'direction', 'ultimately', 'bog', 'film', 'down', 'However', 'fans', 'first', 'TAKEN', '2', 'nice', 'addition', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'required', 'viewing', 'damned', ""n't"", 'decent', 'thrill', 'ride']",N/A

It doesn't happen here.All the actors are back except for the rich husband who is now breaking up with Bryan Miles' (Liam Neeson) ex-wife, played by Famke Janssen. Miles suggests she and the daughter played by Maggie Grace join him in Istanbul after his little security gig is over. Of course, neither of them learned their lesson about staying home the first time and they surprise daddy in Istanbul so this plot can continue.Sure enough they are followed, chased, fight and are captured i.e. Liam and Famke are caught by the family and extended family of the evil pandering, slave-trading, corrupt no-goodniks from Tripolie (pron. Tri-pool-ya), Albania who he killed in Paris in the first film. They manage to find out who he was by beating the French cop, and then by paying off someone in Tirana to find out where he was. As luck would have it, just over the border.With a secret cell phone, Neeson manages to call his daughter who is hiding in the hotel from her would-be captors. She refuses to save herself and bravely states: ""I can do this, Dad.""A 10th grader could have written a better story which held no surprises, hokey dialogue and implausible scenes like Liam talking to his daughter on his cell phone while he has a gun on someone and they have guns on him and his ex. They just stand there! Even the Krav Maga and Hapkido scenes were hard to follow and that 50 caliber machine gun would have split that car down the middle faster than a buzz saw.You might ask several questions, as I did. How did someone in Tirana know that Bryan Miles would be in Istanbul? How did his captors not find the mini-cell phone? Why were their captors leaving them there tied up, to marinate? How come his ex-wife didn't scream at him at the end for asking her to join him in Turkey? How come this director wasn't traded to the Albanians for some future player to be named later?This movie needs massive resuscitation. Only Liam's acting skill and his ability to portray a loving tender father and ex-husband while schizophrenically opening a severe can of whupas give this film a faint heartbeat.My advice is to stay away from Taken 2 or you will be had.",2,Stay Away From Taken 2 or You Will Be Had,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,2218,"['One', 'return', 'great', 'story', 'when', 'make', 'sequel', ""n't"", 'happen', 'here.All', 'actors', 'are', 'back', 'rich', 'husband', 'who', 'now', 'breaking', 'up', 'Bryan', 'Miles', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'ex-wife', 'played', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'Miles', 'daughter', 'played', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'join', 'Istanbul', 'little', 'security', 'gig', 'course', 'learned', 'lesson', 'staying', 'home', 'first', 'time', 'surprise', 'daddy', 'Istanbul', 'plot', 'can', 'continue.Sure', 'are', 'followed', 'chased', 'fight', 'are', 'captured', 'i.e', 'Liam', 'Famke', 'are', 'caught', 'family', 'extended', 'family', 'evil', 'pandering', 'slave-trading', 'corrupt', 'no-goodniks', 'Tripolie', 'pron', 'Tri-pool-ya', 'Albania', 'who', 'killed', 'Paris', 'first', 'film', 'manage', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'was', 'beating', 'French', 'cop', 'then', 'paying', 'off', 'someone', 'Tirana', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'was', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'border.With', 'secret', 'cell', 'phone', 'Neeson', 'call', 'daughter', 'who', 'hiding', 'hotel', 'would-be', 'captors', 'save', 'bravely', 'states', 'can', 'do', 'Dad', '10th', 'grader', 'could', 'have', 'written', 'better', 'story', 'held', 'surprises', 'hokey', 'dialogue', 'implausible', 'scenes', 'Liam', 'talking', 'daughter', 'cell', 'phone', 'gun', 'someone', 'have', 'guns', 'ex', 'just', 'stand', 'there', 'Even', 'Krav', 'Maga', 'Hapkido', 'scenes', 'were', 'hard', 'follow', '50', 'caliber', 'machine', 'gun', 'would', 'have', 'split', 'car', 'down', 'middle', 'faster', 'buzz', 'saw.You', 'might', 'ask', 'several', 'questions', 'did', 'How', 'did', 'someone', 'Tirana', 'know', 'Bryan', 'Miles', 'would', 'be', 'Istanbul', 'How', 'did', 'captors', 'not', 'find', 'mini-cell', 'phone', 'Why', 'were', 'captors', 'leaving', 'there', 'tied', 'up', 'marinate', 'How', 'come', 'ex-wife', 'did', ""n't"", 'scream', 'end', 'asking', 'join', 'Turkey', 'How', 'come', 'director', 'was', ""n't"", 'traded', 'Albanians', 'future', 'player', 'be', 'named', 'later', 'movie', 'massive', 'resuscitation', 'Only', 'Liam', 'acting', 'skill', 'ability', 'portray', 'loving', 'tender', 'father', 'ex-husband', 'schizophrenically', 'opening', 'severe', 'can', 'whupas', 'give', 'film', 'faint', 'heartbeat.My', 'advice', 'stay', 'away', 'Taken', '2', 'will', 'be', 'had']",N/A

Olivier Megaton, and I'm not kidding, 2012, 93 minutes) was fun for me to watch, tough to review because it's a mindless ""actioner"" serving only to showcase Liam Neeson's immensely likeable talents. That man can go from playing Oskar Schindler to performing better than Steven Seagal ever did, as he does here.Neeson returns as CIA security field agent Bryan Mills, this time convincing his ex-wife and daughter to accompany him to Istanbul. They refuse at first - that is only wise - yet in Istanbul suddenly, there they are! Surprise, dad!! What kind of evil international hoodlums are you going to kill for us this time?! In this case, it is the crazy father of one of the men Neeson killed in the original 2008 film.So of course the film spirals down from that point. As I said, the director makes this a fun film. The cinematography is not bad, making Neeson look exactly like a killing machine yet his own skills add to that crisp editing. The man fights better than Seagal on film, and sadly the editing gets too crisp with some of his fight scenes merely a hint and not shown. Too many car chases in Istanbul ... how I hate car chases. These have no style to them, but at least they're over rapidly.The film has a snappy, rapid-fire approach to the violence and its only real redeeming quality is Neeson. It is rushed, illogical, nearly brainless: a typical popcorn film and I enjoyed it as such. It has nowhere near the stunning panache or the skill of the originalTaken(see my review).As it is, it seems both films were virtually ignored. In fact, the original TAKEN, a remake of Steven Seagal'sBelly of the Beast, convinced me that they should have made Neeson the next James Bond and Spielberg ought to have kept him on to play LINCOLN.This has the talents of returning stars Jon Gries (another great perennial favorite of mine), Famke Janssen and Maggie Grace. As for the rest, it's take-it-or-leave-it 'international violence'. But I love nearly anything Neeson does, and I certainly enjoyed this dumb, all-action ""CIA family"" film with its Goth soundtrack - done so brilliantly in the original film - and its careful shadings of color, light and darkness.

1511519,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B0067EKYAY,FNDNreview,"[1, 1]","Liam Neeson is a complete badass.  How do you define a 'badass'?  Well, typically all you'd need to do is look at a picture of Chuck Norris and you'd instantly understand.  But, some things change and clearly Liam Neeson is taking over the Hollywood action scene.  If you need evidence, just watch any of his recent films.  What's that?  You hated The Phantom Menace, but Liam Neeson was still a badass?  Absolutely.  He lightsaber duels with the Sith, he kills man-eating wolves, he battles aliens on the ocean - and yes, he even takes time to beat the crap out of common criminals in Taken.This time, Neeson returns in Taken 2 as Bryan Mills, a former intelligence agent that does security jobs on the side, while trying to maintain a healthy relationship as an over-protective father with his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace).  Rade rbedzija plays the film's villain, Murad Hoxha, an Albania mobster that is seeking revenge for the death of son (one of the countless thugs Neeson killed in the first film).  Famke Janssen also returns as Lenore, Bryan's ex-wife, who just happens to have recently separated with her most recent husband - naturally prompting a Neeson/Janssen reunion.If you're looking for a movie with drama or basically any kind of plot-driven substance, this film isn't really for you.  All you really need to do is see the film's trailer and you'll quickly understand how this film is going to go.  Neeson's character and his wife are abducted and it's up to their daughter to help free them.  It's pretty cut and dry, meaning the film is completely predictable from beginning to end.  However, if you judge the film on that merit, you'll hate it and most likely not even spend your money to see it.  The point of this film (and most any film) is to be entertained - by a watered-down James Bond - who's only mission is to retrieve his family, while beat up the bad guys on his way.Overall, if you're a fan of the first Taken, then you'll definitely want to see the sequel.

Denick,"[0, 0]","The original ""Taken"" was a fast paced, riveting revenge flick that offered brief entertainment, provided you could look past its bizarre flaws (the primary one being a rather racist tone). This sequel contains some of what made the first movie good- Liam Neeson is a hardcore BA, conveying a sense of authentic, lethal ability that is achieved through wisdom and experience, as opposed to high flying kicks and theatrics. All of his combat techniques are ugly, as opposed to being choreographed for beauty, and therefore feel grounded in reality. Neeson's performance is quite good, for the most part, though even he can't erase some particularly bad lines of dialogue that were written for him (a tradition that was established in the original ""Taken"").This movie could have succeeded, but it suffers from a plot that is so disjointed, it's downright weird. It's almost as if the writers were just phoning it in on this one, so as to have the means to create another revenge movie. Nothing wrong with that, necessarily, but it's so disjointed, it almost feels surreal... like the characters are stumbling around in a dream. ""Taken 2"" offers some moderate entertainment for an hour and a half, benefiting from some decent action sequences and the presence of Neeson, but it ultimately proves forgettable.

Taken 2 is the long-awaited sequel to Taken number 1, and it proves yet again that Liam Neeson is so much more than a guy who saved some Jews in some black and white movie from a really long time ago. It proves that Liam Neeson is still an extremely viable and sought-after action movie star...you know, when more popular action stars like Michael Biehn, Dolph Lundgren and Lassie are busy with other projects.In this installment of Taken, Liam Neeson, Maggie Graceless and Famke Johanssen are all able to reunite and have some family time in Istanbul (which is a peace-loving, Muslim city that used to be called Constantinople), which is downright offensive when you consider that Maggie Graceless is still playing a teenager at the age of 30 and that Famke Johanssen is way too old to pretend that she was ever Jean Grey or a Bond ""girl."" Anyhoo, though, reunite they do, and just when Neeson's character and Johanssen's character are about to, shall we say, fornicate in a quickie right before they have to take Maggie Graceless' character to the vet, the bad guys from Taken number 1 burst into the room, ending the anticipated sexual encounter.However, they take Famke Johannsen's character hostage and sell Maggie Graceless' character into white slavery. The movie then ends rather abruptly after some clich&eacute;d, action-movie developments: First, Michael Biehn, Dolph Lundgren and Lassie all make surprise cameos, which really interrupted the flow of the high-stakes drama in my opinion. Then, Neeson's character finally succeeds in saving both Famke Johannsen's and Maggie Graceless' characters, but, being women, they both get angry with him for ""taking too long"" to finally save them, and they slap him aggressively across the face for his efforts. Finally, in what I can only judge as a totally tasteless move by the director, Liam Neeson's dead wife, Natasha Richardson, is actually shown over and over again throughout the closing credits of the movie, which utterly failed to satisfy the director's apparent desire to have some kind of closure in the movie's plot.Despite these problems, I can't wait to buy Taken 2 when it is released on VHS soon. In fact, me and my friends will have a sleepover party to celebrate when Taken 2 is finally available on home video.

Go figure. However, the movie as a whole is very entertaining and well worth the two hours to view. It speeds along nicely without letting yourself get bogged down with details. Much of that comes during the movie and if you're paying attention, will make more sense.

Now we have a sequel (and there may be more, as the end of the film suggests) that just isn't up to the same standard as the original, but for those who saw Part 1, then Part 2 will likely not disappoint.The film opens in Albania where the old father Murad Krasniqi (Rade Serbedzija) is burying his son and some villagers killed by Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) and he vows revenge. Switch to Los Angles where we see Bryan and his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen), who is recuperating from her second divorce, and their daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) who is entering her first relationship with Jamie (a promising Luke Grimes) arguing over priorities.  Bryan still loves Kim and Lenore and when Lenore tearfully confesses her frustration that her plans to take Kim to China to regroup emotionally have fallen through, Bryan announces he has a job in Istanbul, Turkey - 3 days worth - and invites them to join him after his job is complete.But of course in Istanbul Bryan's mission involves offing all the people from the Albanian crew and when Lenore and Kim arrive the family is re-bonded until Murad directs that all three be captured and killed. From there it is the predictable cat and mouse games of capture/escape/killing by every means possible/ car chases action and the few who are left in the end make a pact of sorts...and more need not be said.Oliver Megaton directs a screenplay by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen. One of the glories of the film is the opportunity to see the many sites of Istanbul.

I was happy when Taken 2 finally came out on DVD and ordered it right away, even after reading the negative reviews.  So, it just arrived and I've watched it for the first time.I'm disappointed and angry at the director.  I think he had a poor concept of what the end result of his decisions would look like.  The super-fast camera angle changes during fights in particular were a big mistake.  In fact, I can't think of anything he did right.The acting is great, of course.  The whole cast is superb.  Actually, everything about this movie is first-rate, except for the directing, and if I were rating based on that alone, I would have to give it a 1 since that's the lowest Amazon rating.I don't regret buying it, but I wish I'd waited until the price went down some.  I got it at $14.95, and the price will drop, probably pretty quickly, when the distributors realize they'll have to drop their price in order to sell all their stock.So, buyer beware.  This movie is not nearly as good as the first one.  It's worth owning if you really enjoy watching Liam Neeson take out bad guys and be a hero.  But read the reviews that detail all the bad points about the directing and believe them.  If you still want to own it, as I did, and if like me, you haven't seen it yet, then at least you'll not be unaware when you watch it for the first time.  My recommendation, though, is to rent it first, and decide for yourself how much you like it.

While we were away, Mills and his estranged ex-wife Lenore (Famke Jannsen) had achieved a sort of d&eacute;tente. And when a distraught Lenore admits that her current marriage is speedily crumbling, to try to make her feel better, Mills invites her and Kim to holiday with him in Istanbul where he'll be conducting some security consultant work. Note that Istanbul is practically a stone's throw away from Albania. This is what's known as a foreshadowing observation.At age one hundred and four Liam Neeson still demonstrates fantastic action chops. He generates such gravitas, his performance has such credibility, you just buy that he's perfectly capable of extricating himself from any form of tight scrape. In Istanbul, Krasniqi marshals his forces and strikes, and yet Mills is canny enough to put gum in the works. He and his wife are taken but, thanks to his timely warning, Kim escapes, if barely. We now arrive at the best segment of the film, when a captured Mills, over a phone he'd secreted away, manages to talk Kim thru the intricate process of determining his unknown location. I won't say much more than that, other than the process involves a shoelace, a map, and grenades. What follows is a nifty sequence that equally illustrates Kim's gumption and vulnerability. It allows Maggie Grace to step out of her thankless role of victim. You may have to be generous in overlooking the ridiculous stuff she gets up to in following her dad's orders.Again, the lesson to take away here is ""Do not take Liam Neeson's stuff!"" After the box office success of this sequel there's already talk of a third picture, and I'm down with that. But only if Neeson is a participant. Yes, the sheen brought about by an aged Neeson kicking butt has worn off some, but there's still enough of that luster to make TAKEN 2 a satisfying watch. He abuses more Albanians in this film franchise than Peter Falk ever did in TUNE IN TOMORROW. It's a slick thriller, maybe not a deep one, and it fails to retain the shock value of the first film. It certainly doesn't have anything as memorable as Neeson's awesome ""I will find you"" speech. But I like the in-jokes referencing the first film. And the acting is across-the-board solid, with Rade Sherbedgia making a perfectly hissable big bad. You know he means deadly business when he bluntly informs Famke: ""Mrs. Mills, you are a good mother and a brave woman. For that I am going to send you back home... piece by piece."" Oh, yeah, he's a perfect candidate for Liam Neeson's brand of brutal efficiency. After all, he took Liam's stuff. Dude. Must.

What I will tell you is that it is a great action thriller, and if you are a fan of such movies then I very much recommend checking this out...of course start with the first Taken though if you haven't seen it before this obviously.The action in these is very cool and essentially consists of Liam kicking and shooting up a lot of bad guy @$$!  2 takes a tad bit longer to start picking up than the first movie did, but the action is none the less about as equally cool.  The acting in this movie is pretty good (Liam is always good)...the dialogue at times is a little corny in my opinion between him and his family, but I guess some of that can be expected when it comes to family.All in all though, this movie was very enjoyable, and you just love to see Liam let loose on these baddies...all throughout the movie as they were taking and holding him and his wife and attempting to take his daughter again, I was saying under my breath ""you guys are screwed now.""

Holy cow, what a mess. Given a different director and a slight re-write this movie would have been fantastic. There was so much there to work with, but the director had no idea what he was doing. My wife and I had to rewind almost every other scene because you couldn't tell where people were, what they were doing, or how they did it. The climax of the movie looked like Liam Neeson killed a guy by gently shoving his face. What?! After two rewinds we FINALLY saw that he had been impaled on something that was barely in the frame and you can't see until you look at it very carefully. We love action movies and we don't need to be spoon fed a narrative, but it REALLY helps when the shots actually show you what the heck is going on.And on that note, hey, Oliver ""Megaton"" Fontana! It's called ""Shaky"" cam, not ""Donkey With Restless Leg Syndrome Is Kicking the Camera"" cam. And quick zooms don't work if that's all you do for two hours and the framing NEVER focuses on the subjects. Seriously, this guy would start already partially zoomed in to frame a character and then he would quick zoom so fast that the camera couldn't find the actor for 3-4 seconds, all the while we're looking at a car bumper or a blank wall. And when your shots only LAST 4 seconds max, that's an eternity of time in which we can't watch a movie because this guy obviously doesn't know how photography works. I did a count with about 30 minutes to go in the movie and I gave up after 10 minutes because there was exactly ONE scene in which he kept a shot going for longer than 3 seconds. Most of the shots only lasted half a second and then we're slammed into another angle, camera gyrating wildly, and then before we can focus, WHACK, we're in yet another shot. It's called pacing, ""Megaton"". This guy shouldn't be hired to do anything other than music videos or McDonalds ads. Then his complete lack of a clue wouldn't be as noticeable. This isn't a style, it's a desperate bid to use a camera technique to hide incompetence.A quick word about the director's name. He calls himself Oliver Megaton. His real name is Oliver Fontana. If you have the arrogance to name yourself after a measurement for explosive force, then at least be sure you have the skill to back that mess up. This guy shouldn't call himself ""Megaton"".

The film reinvented Liam Neeson as a late-in-life action hero (despite having a few successful action films earlier in his career) and was a surprise hit at the box office thanks to its neutered PG-13 rating. A harder cut surfaced on Blu-ray, and the famous monologue of Neeson threatening the kidnappers on the phone entered pop culture, giving the studio hope that a sequel would do big business. The gamble worked, and the sequel took more money than the first. Is it any good? I expected the worst, but I actually prefer this movie to the first.Made four years later, but set unspecified years later, Bryan Mills and infantile daughter Kim are still getting over their disastrous trip to Paris (where you are guaranteed to to be kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery, so don't even think about it). Former-bitch former-wife Lenore is now back in love with Bryan and surprises him on his last day of a Istanbul assignment by showing up at the hotel. New trip, new disaster. Will the Mills family ever learn to stay at home in America where nothing ever bad ever happened to anyone?The daddy of the evil kidnapper in the first movie has somehow managed to find Mills and has an army of lowlifes (all of them dressing in dirty 1980s clothes that seemed to have washed-up in a lost container on a Yugoslavian beach some time in 1991) willing to sacrifice their existence for the most arbitrary of reasons (untaxed pay and the boss' approval). Mills and wife are quickly kidnapped and it's up to Kim to rescue them and let him loose to kill, kill, kill the evil foreign men.I found this film to be more exciting and the danger was ramped-up. It lacks the variety of locations of the first movie (almost every scene is set in a dark alley), and there are some ludicrous plot contrivances (Mills' CIA pals fixing everything with a phonecall or the fact that Jean-Claude still has the same job despite his massive corruption being exposed) but it moves fast enough to make it a non-issue. The action is hard-hitting and Neeson is still a force to be reckoned with as he effortlessly dominates the movie with his presence.The Blu-ray looks great in 2.40:1 1080p. The movie was shot in a strange combination of Super35 and anamorphic Panavision with lots of high brightness and contrast. Not amazing photography, but it looks nice.

1511578,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B0067EKYAY,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 4]","This film is done for the European public first of all but it should work in the USA with the nostalgia of so many action films and of course Midnight Express. But the main difference with this film is that here we do not know why the Albanians and this American security agent are fighting. Albania was on the border of the war in Kosovo. So we know there is a political problem and stake. Albania was the communist country that had absolutely banned all religious activities and all religious expression. So, what's left to keep the Albanians away from kidnapping young girls and women to feed them in their lucrative prostitution network? Nothing, not even religious beliefs to try to repent, at least five minutes a day. And we just learned Albania is getting ready to join the European Community. Really? Yes, so they say in the media.Even more surprising is the fact that the action mainly takes place in Turkey, in Istanbul. Turkey wants to join the European Community and the Euro Zone and that's tricky to provide the European public with that totally violent, terroristic and immoral image of Istanbul. Is it trying to ask this question from all Europeans: Are you going to let that country enter the European Community as if they were peaceful and law-abiding? Or is it asking that other question from the Turks: How can you dare to want to enter the European Community when you are not even able to prevent your territory from being used like that by terrorists without any other motivation than their personal vengeance?The film is ambiguous and very obscure as for its political and ideological motivations. It cannot move the Americans who know nothing about these political questions, but it may frankly be disturbing to the European or Turkish public.But it is a film by Luc Besson. So there are other elements than just this unclear ideological context.First it is an action film and Luc Besson here uses an extremely rapid tempo with no slowing down except to increase the suspense and to make us fear the worst. The action is also extremely simple in the means it uses. No super technology. The good old simple cars and car chases, then a simple pager, then some simple guns: grenades, hand guns and some assault automatic guns. That's all. All the rest is simple running and tricky inventiveness. Of course the escape through the window and along a narrow cornice on the faade of a hotel has already been used but its simplicity works perfectly well.Second Luc Besson has to add a child, here a teenage daughter that should be just over sixteen, since she is trying to get her driver's license and she has already failed twice. Her being in any kind of danger is poignant of course, and her mother being captured and used as bait is just as bad. And Luc Besson cannot evade the clich&eacute;, but so well done and used, of the father fixation and of that father who saves his daughter first and his wife, at least twice. We remember L&eacute;on of course and the little girl he decides to help in her necessary vengeance since all her family has just been executed by some dumb terrorists. That's a syndrome if not a tic or even an idiosyncrasy of Luc Besson's: the father figure that saves the day of a daughter, a mother, a family, a victim of some terroristic gang violence. That gives a touch of empathy.The end then would not surprise at all and is so typical of Besson again. The daughter is over sixteen and so she is of age. So she has a boyfriend and the father is kind of jealous somewhere, but Besson must be aging since he is able to make the father step back from his protective jealousy concerning his daughter. Charming.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Try to survive this one,1350259200,"10 15, 2012",2012,3677,"['film', 'done', 'European', 'public', 'first', 'should', 'work', 'USA', 'nostalgia', 'so', 'many', 'action', 'films', 'course', 'Midnight', 'Express', 'main', 'difference', 'film', 'here', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'why', 'Albanians', 'American', 'security', 'agent', 'are', 'fighting', 'Albania', 'was', 'border', 'war', 'Kosovo', 'know', 'political', 'problem', 'stake', 'Albania', 'was', 'communist', 'country', 'had', 'absolutely', 'banned', 'religious', 'activities', 'religious', 'expression', 'So', 'what', 'left', 'keep', 'Albanians', 'away', 'kidnapping', 'young', 'girls', 'women', 'feed', 'lucrative', 'prostitution', 'network', 'Nothing', 'not', 'even', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'try', 'repent', 'least', 'five', 'minutes', 'day', 'just', 'learned', 'Albania', 'getting', 'ready', 'join', 'European', 'Community', 'Really', 'Yes', 'say', 'media.Even', 'more', 'surprising', 'fact', 'action', 'mainly', 'place', 'Turkey', 'Istanbul', 'Turkey', 'join', 'European', 'Community', 'Euro', 'Zone', 'tricky', 'provide', 'European', 'public', 'totally', 'violent', 'terroristic', 'immoral', 'image', 'Istanbul', 'trying', 'ask', 'question', 'Europeans', 'Are', 'going', 'let', 'country', 'enter', 'European', 'Community', 'were', 'peaceful', 'law-abiding', 'asking', 'other', 'question', 'Turks', 'How', 'can', 'dare', 'want', 'enter', 'European', 'Community', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'able', 'prevent', 'territory', 'being', 'used', 'terrorists', 'other', 'motivation', 'personal', 'vengeance', 'film', 'ambiguous', 'very', 'obscure', 'political', 'ideological', 'motivations', 'can', 'not', 'move', 'Americans', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'political', 'questions', 'may', 'frankly', 'be', 'disturbing', 'European', 'Turkish', 'public.But', 'film', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'are', 'other', 'elements', 'just', 'unclear', 'ideological', 'context.First', 'action', 'film', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'here', 'extremely', 'rapid', 'tempo', 'slowing', 'down', 'increase', 'suspense', 'make', 'fear', 'worst', 'action', 'also', 'extremely', 'simple', 'means', 'super', 'technology', 'good', 'old', 'simple', 'cars', 'car', 'chases', 'then', 'simple', 'pager', 'then', 'simple', 'guns', 'grenades', 'hand', 'guns', 'assault', 'automatic', 'guns', 'rest', 'simple', 'running', 'tricky', 'inventiveness', 'course', 'escape', 'window', 'narrow', 'cornice', 'faade', 'hotel', 'already', 'been', 'used', 'simplicity', 'perfectly', 'well.Second', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'add', 'child', 'here', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'should', 'be', 'just', 'sixteen', 'trying', 'get', 'driver', 'license', 'already', 'failed', 'twice', 'being', 'kind', 'danger', 'poignant', 'course', 'mother', 'being', 'captured', 'used', 'bait', 'just', 'bad', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'can', 'not', 'evade', 'clich', 'eacute', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'used', 'father', 'fixation', 'father', 'who', 'daughter', 'first', 'wife', 'least', 'twice', 'remember', 'L', 'eacute', 'course', 'little', 'girl', 'help', 'necessary', 'vengeance', 'family', 'just', 'been', 'executed', 'dumb', 'terrorists', 'syndrome', 'not', 'tic', 'even', 'idiosyncrasy', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'father', 'figure', 'day', 'daughter', 'mother', 'family', 'victim', 'terroristic', 'gang', 'violence', 'touch', 'empathy.The', 'end', 'then', 'would', 'not', 'surprise', 'so', 'typical', 'Besson', 'again', 'daughter', 'sixteen', 'so', 'age', 'boyfriend', 'father', 'kind', 'jealous', 'somewhere', 'Besson', 'must', 'be', 'aging', 'able', 'make', 'father', 'step', 'back', 'protective', 'jealousy', 'concerning', 'daughter', 'Charming.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

1511581,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B0067EKYAY,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[0, 0]","Thanks to the first film of the TAKEN series, under the auspices of 20th Century Fox, Liam Neeson as butt-kicking ex-spy Bryan Mills has successfully rebranded himself as one of the elder statesman of action cinema, now able almost to be spoken in the same sentence as names like Willis or Stallone. Then after that came a series that should have pushed the point home that he didn't belong there, with films like THE A-TEAM and UNKNOWN, which were both terrifically bad films. Unfortunately, he reteamed with A-TEAM director Joe Carnahan for THE GREY, an existential survival thriller that was well-received amongst fans and not unliked by critics. So, the Neeson Express was still rolling, and Fox, never knowing when to let a good idea lie (see the ALIEN, PREDATOR or DIE HARD series for evidence of this), decided to try to create a franchise out of what could only really succeed as a one-off. This led us to TAKEN 2, and what is one of the most boring, most unentertaining and really, one of the stupidest films of the year.Basically, the film revolves around Mills' recently-divorced ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen, reprising her role) and daughter Kim (Maggie Grace, also reprising her ageless role) surprising him in Istanbul very shortly after he's concluded his protection service there. At the same time, the father (the wasted character actor Rade Serbedzija) of the ""Good Luck"" Albanian who Mills let fry in the chair from the first film, has sworn vengeance on Mills and his family. But instead of the daughter being taken, it's him and his wife. And Kim is the only one that can assist her father. And through a series of increasingly implausible scenarios, Mills takes the bad guys on to save his ex-wife.I know that some people felt that there could never be a sequel to a film like DIE HARD because of how singular that film felt. Four sequels later, they're still expanding the idea to a fault. Well, TAKEN, because of its specific plot (kidnapped daughter), can really only work once, and as evidenced by this film, it's true. Bryan Mills, while being a badass, is little else. His motivations to save the wife of his ex-wife, who seems very keen on rekindling their relationship after her latest marriage ends, seem much weaker than a father protecting his daughter, and his pursuit of their assailants seem much more languid and rote. This is obviously a film that is going to hold no surprises, and to be honest, that should be enough. But the direction by French-director-with-the-greatest-action-film-director-name-ever, Olivier Megaton (TRANSPORTER 3, COLOMBIANA) is, similarly to his previous work, pretty uninspired and has no real excitement or vitality to it. Even the ""final fight sequence"" is dull and unimpressive. Neeson is just going through the motions here. I appreciate that actors are working people, and that they need to get some change in their pockets, but Neeson must have turned down better films than this. Janssen just exists to look nearly unconscious through most of the film, and Grace, who I really loved on LOST, and thought she was a lot of fun in the film LOCKOUT, has an expanded role here, but still makes not much of an impression. Plus, how old is she supposed to be? In LOST, she seemed to be in her early to mid-twenties, but in these films, she seems to be in her teens, and it really doesn't work.I'm going to perhaps spoil something here, so you might want to not continue reading if you don't want to know more about the most idiotic point of the film. The film opens with Bryan looks to give his daughter driving lessons since she keeps flunking the parallel parking part. Of course, this means that a certain part of the film will require her to drive. When we get to this film's been-done-a-thousand-times-before car chase, she is inexplicably behind the wheel and instead of there being any beats where she is driving the car poorly, or is freaking out because she can't get the car in gear, she is driving this car like Jason Bourne on a bottle of No-Doz. She is doing things with a six-speed manual transmission that master stunt drivers would be envious of. And the finale of this chase scene culminates with Bryan instructing his daughter to drive DIRECTLY THROUGH the gates of the American Embassy without stopping, assuring that 50-caliber machine guns and other weapons begin firing at the car. And you know what? That's not even the stupidest part of the scene. It's when Bryan makes a call to one of his stateside spy buddies that puts an ignominous cap on this frighteningly moronic scene.If I didn't think that TAKEN 2 was a bad idea before I saw it, I can guarantee to you now that it's a way of wasting valuable time that you will never get back.

1511597,A1QHW2L0RU54QQ,B0067EKYAY,jeheist,"[47, 60]","Recently watched movie review:*Taken 2 (2012)- 1/5Taken 2 is a sequel to the 2008 film (Taken) which is newly directed by Oliver Megaton. It stars Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace, Famke Janssen, and Rade Sherbedgia. I love the first movie, so does Taken 2 live up to my expectations? Ha, it's not even in the same league, and it's the worst movie I've seen so far this year.Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) killed a lot of men while searching for his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), who was taken in Paris by a human trafficking ring. Family members of the men, whom he killed in the first film, are mourning those who died. Murad (Rade Sherbedgia) who's the employer of the men and father of Marko, a victim whom Bryan killed, swears revenge, and states that they will find Bryan to avenge the deaths of their loved ones. Murad and is men capture Bryan and his ex wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen), while Kim lucks out and helps her parents escape death.Taken 2 falls flat in every single way possible compared to the awesomeness of the first Taken movie. Let me start off by saying the only good thing about the film... (crickets), (crickets), (crickets)... That's right, there's nothing good to say about it.There are so many 'I just rolled my eyes' moments in the film, and there's very little that's believable; While Bryan is involved in a gun standoff with Mured's men, the kind men let him whip out his phone to warn Kim that he and Lenore are being taken (I just rolled my eyes). Kim can't pass 2 driving tests, but she can throw grenades, do geometry, jump from rooftop to rooftop, and can drive like a stunt driver in a chase scene (I just rolled my eyes). Murad, who knows Bryan can kill just about anyone, gives Lenore a baby gash, hangs her upside down, tells Bryan, who's tied to a pole, that she's got 30 minutes until she dies, leaves the room with them unattended, and expects everything to go as plan (I just rolled my eyes). When Bryan obviously breaks free and saves Lenore, he later fights some of Murad's men, but somehow he's got special powers this time around; Bryan can simply put his hands on someone's face, and that person will instantly die (I just rolled  myeyes).The first Taken was far more energetic, there was more dialog, the villain isn't old and pathetic, and events were much more believable. Taken 2 is soulless compared to the first, and should be avoided at all costs as this is a simple cash grab. If you're a fan of the first (like me) and wanted a sequel, use your imagination instead, and continue to just watch the first Taken. If you couldn't tell by now, Taken 2 gets a recommended 'must-pass.'",1,Recently watched movie review: Taken 2 (2012),1353628800,"11 23, 2012",2012,2624,"['Recently', 'watched', 'movie', 'review', '*Taken', '2', '2012', '1/5Taken', '2', 'sequel', '2008', 'film', 'Taken', 'newly', 'directed', 'Oliver', 'Megaton', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'Rade', 'Sherbedgia', 'love', 'first', 'movie', 'so', 'Taken', '2', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'Ha', 'not', 'even', 'same', 'league', 'worst', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'year.Bryan', 'Mills', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'killed', 'lot', 'men', 'searching', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'who', 'was', 'taken', 'Paris', 'human', 'trafficking', 'ring', 'Family', 'members', 'men', 'whom', 'killed', 'first', 'film', 'are', 'mourning', 'who', 'died', 'Murad', 'Rade', 'Sherbedgia', 'who', 'employer', 'men', 'father', 'Marko', 'victim', 'whom', 'Bryan', 'killed', 'swears', 'revenge', 'states', 'will', 'find', 'Bryan', 'avenge', 'deaths', 'loved', 'ones', 'Murad', 'men', 'capture', 'Bryan', 'ex', 'wife', 'Lenore', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'Kim', 'out', 'parents', 'escape', 'death.Taken', '2', 'falls', 'flat', 'single', 'way', 'possible', 'compared', 'awesomeness', 'first', 'Taken', 'movie', 'Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'film', 'crickets', 'crickets', 'crickets', 'right', 'nothing', 'good', 'say', 'it.There', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'just', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'moments', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'believable', 'Bryan', 'involved', 'gun', 'standoff', 'Mured', 'men', 'kind', 'men', 'let', 'whip', 'out', 'phone', 'warn', 'Kim', 'Lenore', 'are', 'being', 'taken', 'just', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'Kim', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pass', '2', 'driving', 'tests', 'can', 'throw', 'grenades', 'do', 'geometry', 'jump', 'rooftop', 'rooftop', 'can', 'drive', 'stunt', 'driver', 'chase', 'scene', 'just', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'Murad', 'who', 'Bryan', 'can', 'kill', 'just', 'anyone', 'Lenore', 'baby', 'gash', 'upside', 'down', 'tells', 'Bryan', 'who', 'tied', 'pole', 'got', '30', 'minutes', 'room', 'unattended', 'everything', 'go', 'plan', 'just', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'When', 'Bryan', 'obviously', 'free', 'Lenore', 'later', 'fights', 'Murad', 'men', 'somehow', 'got', 'special', 'powers', 'time', 'around', 'Bryan', 'can', 'simply', 'put', 'hands', 'someone', 'face', 'person', 'will', 'instantly', 'die', 'just', 'rolled', 'myeyes', '.The', 'first', 'Taken', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'energetic', 'was', 'more', 'dialog', 'villain', ""n't"", 'old', 'pathetic', 'events', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'Taken', '2', 'soulless', 'compared', 'first', 'should', 'be', 'avoided', 'costs', 'simple', 'cash', 'grab', ""'re"", 'fan', 'first', 'wanted', 'sequel', 'use', 'imagination', 'instead', 'continue', 'just', 'watch', 'first', 'Taken', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'now', 'Taken', '2', 'recommended', ""'must-pass""]",N/A

In a slightly absurd plot device, Mills' daughter Kim (Maggie Grace, who is 30 and continues to play adolescents convincingly) and wife Lenore (Famke Jannsen) follow him to Istanbul, overwhelmed by enthusiasm because Kim has just learned to drive.Well, as you might guess, they are &#34;Taken&#34;.

There was still a lot of action and it had a fasted paced plot and storyline but the concept was just not as fresh. In some of the areas the scenarios were just a little hard to believe.Byran Mills (Liam Neeson) is in the protection business using his skills that he learned in the CIA to protect wealthy people for a lot of money. His family life is a wreck as he is divorced and his daughter lives with her mom. After rescuing his daughter in the first Taken film he becomes a target of international terrorists who seek revenge for the deaths of their family members (Sons) at the hands of Bryan who killed them as he rescued his kidnapped daughter.As Bryan's ex-wife and daughter meet up with him in Istanbul the terrorists gather to enact plans to kidnap them all and have the added joy of torturing his family in front of him...Liam Neeson does his regular spectacular best in this movie playing the highly skilled ex-CIA agent on a mission to save his family.

1511627,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B0067EKYAY,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[6, 9]","look no further than Liam Neeson.  With Taken (which I have not seen) and Taken 2 (which I have), Neeson proves he has the intelligence, resourcefulness, cool composure, and presence to sell us on a new Bond.If the first Taken (as I understand it) was an efficiently violent revenge fantasy, Taken 2 is basically an efficiently violent ""revenge for the revenge fantasy"" of the first movie.  I will not regurgitate the plot here.  I refer you to Steven Aldersley's Taken 2 review for that.  Instead, I wish to pursue the strong Bondian elements that propel this fast, exciting flick, particularly Neeson's character's  (Bryan's) cool intelligence.  Bryan is captured and hooded , along with his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) by vengeful Albanian father Rade (Murad Hoxha) grieving for the white slavery mastermind son that Bryan killed in the first movie for attempting to kidnap his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace).  However, he is able to compose a mental map of his surroundings (Istanbul, Turkey) by listening to distinct sounds and calculating the intervals between them.  That way, he is able to convey a meticulous sequence of directions to Kim, who managed to stay safe at the hotel, so she can pinpoint his approximate location and provide him with a handgun to help him free himself and possibly Lenore.  I don't know if this is plausible, but it certainly seems ingenious.Even before all the action begins, we appreciate the precautions and weapons Bryan takes and accumulates (including mini-cell phones and other devices) to handle any dangerous exigency.  Later in the movie, even after being beaten and chained in a filthy basement, it's gratifying to see Bryan not only attempt to free himself, but also give those precise instructions to Lenore, and particularly Kim, to help him and them escape their predicament.  Realistically, both Lenore and Kim are fearful and uncertain what to do, but Bryan's cool CIA-operative professionalism helps keep them focused.  He may be retired, but Bryan is such a one-man assault gang, you get the feeling that Rade and his gang, despite their savage ruthlessness, never really stood a chance.Yes, Taken 2 is quite an enjoyable action thrill ride, but I am rating it about 3.5 stars for the following reasons: 1) as other posters have mentioned, much of the action, especially the taxi chase through the very narrow Istanbul street, was shot in that nauseating shaky-cam style that made it hard to follow the action sometimes, and made you wonder how Bryan, for all his skill, actually made it through alive.  I thought Kim was gonna collide with some car any minute - and her without a driver's license, 2) there's a slight whiff of xenophobia, especially in the depiction of Istanbul.  From a distance, it is a magnificent metropolis, but once the movie gets closer, you notice the extreme poverty and claustrophobia of the favela-like neighborhoods.  It looks forbidding.  The Turkish Tourist Board, probably just recovering from ""Midnight Express""'s unflattering portrayal, now has to contend with this movie's, and later, ironically, the latest Bond flick Skyfall's depiction.  First the Albanians, now the Turks.  Europe doesnt seem like such a nice place. 3) you have what Roger Ebert calls the Fallacy of the Talking Killer, which states that instead of killing the hero outright, the villain wastes time boasting and talking about what terrible things he'll do to him, giving the hero a chance to retaliate.  If Rade despises Bryan so much for killing his son, why toy with him so long?  Yeah, yeah, you wouldn't have a movie.  So you go with it.Oh, whatever.  Taken 2 is nevertheless an efficient, sharp, involving movie with not only action, but also snatches of humor (e.g. Bryan's reaction to Kim's latest boyfriend, the taxi's barreling towards the U.S. Embassy - ""The soldiers will get out of the way."") So what can we expect of Taken 3? Hmm, I know.  Kim and her new boyfriend Jamie (Luke Grimes) go to Bratislava and encounter a ""Hostel"" situation.  Bryan to the rescue!One more trivial thought.  My friend Ron Spiegel, who watched the movie with me, thought Rade looked like ""the most interesting man in the world"" from the Dos Equus commercials.

I can honestly tell you that I would put it evenly with Taken 1.

It really felt like they wanted to truly continue the story of what would happen to a family after the events of the first movie had taken place, and they even brought back the entire supporting cast from the first.

1511656,A28QU1UG32PYNV,B0067EKYAY,"Katie A. E. ""Words-at-war""","[0, 0]","The first Taken really catapulted Liam Neeson in an unexpected genre: the action super hero. It was fresh, original and exciting. That was in large part to Neeson himself, who is so unassuming as ex-CIA Agent Bryan Mills; but he is such a talented Actor and the characterization was done so well without doing too much in the first film. So when Taken 2 came out, I was really excited. However, with the good, there is the bad.*Spoilers ahead*GOOD: Neeson is as awesome as ever. More importantly, he continues to be believable and virtually carries the whole film with some help of Maggie Grace, aka, Kim Mills. The whole cast was back, from the ex-wife to his group of spy friends to the French Inspector, even if briefly for most. The plot had lots of potential with the Albanian family of the men Mills killed, coming after the Mills family for revenge. The action is good, fast-pace and typical Luc Besson, ala Transporter.BAD: Pretty much everything else. I don't mind repetition when done right. However, the screenplay, as a whole, is a complete bust and tries waaaaay to hard to recapture the energy and quiet intelligence of the first Taken. For one, it nearly mimics the first movie in every respect, including dialogue, which got cringeworthy. It is also set just months after Kim's rescue, which didn't make any sense since the actress was 29 at the time and didn't look like a high school girl about to get her driver's license. The characterization of the ex-wife, Lenore, is the second  worst in the movie, but Famke Janssen did her best but it wasn't good enough to compete with Neeson or even Grace. The overall performance is forced, stilted and cliched. The worst characterization of the story is Murad, the Albanian leader who kidnaps the MIlls and is the father of one of the slain kidnappers who first kidnapped Kim. The writers did poorly in developing a truly evil counterpart to Mills. He is not this scary evil villain that you're glad the good guy disposes of accordingly. He was not even close to Mills stature and to not have a villain who is worthy and equal to Mills was just pathetic and for me, weakens the movie.Ugh, the dialogue; it got distracting and was horrendous. Ignore it to truly enjoy the movie. Besson (The Professional,La Femme Nikita), who is one of my favorite directors, is not the best writer; he should have stuck to directing this film himself which is something he does best and this movie could have used it.

Or you can die here.Murad: What are you telling me?Bryan Mills: What I'm saying is: if you give me your word, I will throw down this gun and simply walk away.Murad: Why?Bryan Mills: Because I am tired of it all.Heh.

While Taken isn't the most inventive action film, it was very enjoyable and had some genuine excitement. This is not the case for Taken 2. Taken 2 takes the ""Bourne"" approach even more than the first, utilizing the very cliched shaky cam and quick cuts. Quick cuts are even used in slow dialogue scenes, and for no obvious reason. As an editor myself, I believe cuts should be precise, intentional, and purposeful. As I was studying some of the shots in this film, I came to the conclusion that the editors didn't really put much thought into WHY the cuts were being made, other than to make the film faster-paced, and it didn't work. Also, the director overused high-shutter speed cameras to ""intensify"" fight scenes. This made me dislike the film even more, as this is an extremely overused technique. This film wasn't just bad technically. The writing was poor. A friend I was with even pointed out some contradictions in the dialogue, causing some serious continuity issues. The writers were very sloppy and it is clear the focus of this film was not on the story or the writing, but the action, which is something a film should NEVER do.I apologize for not being able to find anything good with this film. Taken 2 is a prime example of what I dislike about action films: fast cuts, shaky cam, and high shutter speeds, not to mention, poor writing and dry acting. This film was obviously action-based with weak characters and a very flimsy script. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to go to the movies and literally be in a coma and not use their brain whatsoever.

When the father of one of the villains Bryan killed swears revenge, and takes Bryan and his wife hostage in Istanbul, Bryan enlists Kim to help them escape. Bryan then employs his unique tactics to get his family to safety and systematically take out the kidnappers, one by one.The cast led by Liam Neeson (as Bryan), Maggie Grace (as Kim) & Famke Janssen (as Lenore) is great. The directing by Olivier Megaton is great. The screenplay by Luc Besson (who also produced) & Robert Mark Kamen is great.The music by Nathaniel Mechaly is great. The cinematography by Romain Lacourbas is great. The film editing by Camille Delamarre & Vincent Tabaillon is great. The production design by Sebastien Inizan is great. The art direction by Nanci Roberts & Atilla Yilmaz is great. The set dressings by Joshua Foster, John Markovich & Franck 'Frenchy' Brousse is great. The special effects coordinated by Donn Markel & supervised by Philippe Hubin is great. The stunts coordinated by Mark Vanselow, Alain Figlarz, Laurent Demianoff & Michel Julienne is great.This is a great action sequel to a great action movie that is entertaining and fast-paced.

In all honesty, I haven't seen such a dearth of weak sorry excuses for filmmaking since the late 70s-thru-mid 80s, where schlock was king. This is a new Dark Age for many cinephiles. The digital revolution allowing ill-trained, ill-equipped, lowest common denominators access to the technical and commercial inroads that were previously closed off, disgorging a stunning plethora of cinematic garbage.So remember that when considering formula films. What they lack in creativity, they more than make up for in pure adrenaline enjoyment.As before, retired field agent Bryan Mills is placed in the position of having to defend his family from a host of nogoodniks. However, in a twist, he finds himself as the primary target.Having righteously killed his daughter's kidnappers, and as family is the theme of the franchise, what he had forgotten was that those worthless turds had family too. Angry families. Gangster families.Despite the fact that Marco, a.k.a. Mr. ""Good Luck"", was a sincere bleeping scumbag who kidnapped young women, violently raped and abused them, then dumped them into slave pits to suffer a horrific and sickening life of drug induced prostitution and an anonymous garbage dump of a grave - his father doesn't care what his p.o.s. of a son did, only that it was his son that was killed. And he wants his pound of flesh. Literally.The obvious failing, and one that did slightly annoy, was the plot avoidance of Revenge Rule No. 1: You can never go back.Once you burn a bridge, especially when it's filled with people, that's gone forever. You can never return to where that bridge once stood. But what do the Mills do? Seriously, Europe should've been dead to them. Even an English or Irish trip would've been risky. The continent? Forget it. There are at least three other global land masses one can explore over one's lifetime. Lotta room in the world not to have to repeatedly bump into people. Especially people who detest and hate you.Other than that minor complaint, 'Two' was a kickass epinephrine rush!Very solid four.Personal Note:- I'm a huge fan of Leland Orser and would love to see a film just about his character. The man shares the technical, political and badass intelligence background as the main character, Bryan Mills, but seems infinitely more hooked into the system.

He and his henchman travel to Istanbul and get a bonus in that Kim and Bryan's ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) meet him there.

I laughed as I left the theater because of how bad some of the movie is:1) Liam Neeson's hand-to-hand fighting skills must have atrophied a lot, because every time he is in a fight with a thug (did I mention they were all ugly?) the director uses about 6 camera angles to film the fight, and uses editing so choppy that you can't tell what anyone involved in the fight is doing.2) Maggie Grace is playing the high-school aged daughter of Liam!  She looks like she's about 30 here, and her bad hair-dye is matched only by her too-brief nude scene (back only, no butt).3) SPOILER HERE:  The mom is like a character out of the old Monty Python sketch..she is 'not quite dead' about five times in the flick.

I hadn't had the pleasure of that particular piece of cinema as I took my seat in the Odeon Leicester Square: it turned out not to matter.We open with a glamorous helicopter shot of an unglamorous Albanian truck, bouncing up a dirt road to a communal hilltop burial ground where, clutching a fistful of dust over his family's manifold fallen, patriarchal villain Murad (Rade Serbedzija) gravely swears vengeance on Mills' head, beseeching most of what remains of his extended family (still handsomely stocked with uncles, second cousins and nephews) to join him.That Mills only came to be involved after the village kidnapped his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) and sold her (among others) into slavery does not upset the Albanians' moral calculus. Burial ceremonies complete, they mount a convoy of dusty Mercs and make haste to Istanbul where, as luck would have it, Bryan is attempting a low-key reconciliation with his wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) and daughter (yes: the same one who was kidnapped last time she left L.A: clearly not the lesson-learning type).Mills' patiently-recounted OCD, which sees him insist on (ahem) polishing his own bonnet at the car wash, seems not to extend to keeping his dependents reasonably out of harm's way: After a scene-setting educational ride across the Bosphorus (""it's where East meets West"" etc etc) and the obligatory aerial shot of Istanbul's grand mosque as the muezzin calls the faithful to prayer, the Albanian Mercs roll in. Cue mayhem.This is big, dumb fun on a Luc Besson scale. As long as you can balance between being neither taking it at all seriously nor finding it entirely absurd (a challenge with which most of the audience, including your correspondent, struggled) it will keep you entertained.Joyously-named director Olivier Megaton - vraiment de l'ecole Besson - certainly gives it the by name/by nature treatment: many bottomless semi-automatic magazines, carelessly-tossed hand grenades, twisted necks, caved-in skulls, improvised shivs, exploding cars and kick boxing demonstrations are required to progress a surprisingly tedious plot to a very pre-ordained conclusion. Megaton doesn't even bother with a they-think-its-all-over-but-he's-not-yet-dead final scene bad-guy reprise. Instead, proceedings draw to a indecently hasty conclusion, the film ending with a bookend glamorous helicopter shot of - wait for it - the family eating waffles in a pier-end restaurant in Venice Beach. This about says it all.Why Liam Neeson, a sound actor and surely the sine qua non of the picture, felt at all compelled to make it is a mystery.

Parallel parking's difficulty level is now far greater than the difficulty level of evading multiple Turkish police interceptors in the maze of streets in the centre of Istanbul (not Constantinople).You have to pull yourself together now, and finish reading this review. As long as your father is there in the passenger seat commanding you in short, staccato word-bursts, you can drive a Mercedes 5-speed taxicab through narrow twisting alleys and never miss a gear. Keep going.I'll bet you never knew the U.S. Embassy in Istanbul was located at the centre of a maze of twisting streets and narrow alleys. It's turns out that's where the U.S. likes to locate its embassies, at least in majority-Islamic countries: far from the airport, in the midst of the city where there are the tightest, narrowest streets, where you can't see what's up ahead of the motorcade too well, and with lots of irregular architecture on either side; lots of good routes for escorting those important diplomats to and from the airport.You know, ""Taken 2"" had my interest, as did the much better first in the ""Taken"" franchise. But then it got silly. And I started to laugh a lot more than I should've. ""Taken 3"" should be the story of Kim (Maggie Grace) dating this young Albanian-American guy whose family aren't killers, slavers, or kidnappers (they own a shop that sells designer clothes); that'll be good for some dramatic tension between the boyfriend and the Bryan Mills character. And then Kim and her boyfriend get taken by some vengeance-minded Americans who've decided they've had enough with Albanians kidnapping people all over the world. And then Bryan and Lenore Mills get taken by a group of Albanians who mistake them for the previously mentioned Americans who kidnapped Kim and her boyfriend, whom the Albanians are trying to rescue. And then THOSE Albanians get kidnapped by a group of Chuvash villagers from north of the Volga River. The Chuvash villagers then hire a highly trained group of Faroe Islands natives whose specialty is abduction, to kidnap themSELVES, and the entire story is told backwards, with all the scenes in reverse order. Christopher Nolan will direct.""Taken 2"" is good for what it's supposed to be: a movie with a lot of action. Car action. Gun action. Hand-to-hand combat action.  It's just hard to take any of it seriously. The first one had the advantage of that premise that clearly sells a lot of movies: (deep voice) they %#*!ed with the wrong man. Also, moviegoers seem to take a degree of perverse pleasure in seeing innocence get threatened, as long as those doing the threatening of innocence are horrifyingly punished and killed later on in the film. ""Taken 2"" it's like... nobody cares if Mr. and Mrs. Mills get kidnapped. They're not innocent, playful ing&eacute;nues with hearts of gold, facing an horrific fate that would make the strongest person blanch with terror.But hey, the performers need to take a bow, because they never falter in their honest portrayals of these made-up characters. Their conviction is perfect, even when things get silly. In ""Taken 1"" Maggie Grace had to create a convincing, true to life persona out of the rawest human emotions (extreme excitement/happiness and extreme terror) and succeeded admirably. In ""Taken 2"" she plays the clich&eacute; part of ""18 year-old girl in love for the first time"" like a real, live person and Not a clich&eacute;; matured by her ordeals, but still a bit of a romantic and starlet-wannabe. She turns in a better, more varied performance here than she did as the San Fernando Valley clich&eacute; in ""Taken 1.""And can anyone think of anything bad to say about Famke Janssen or Rade Serbedzija? If so, those people had best not come near me, for I have several choice words I would fain share with such people.And no matter how bad a movie gets, I will not, I will Never diss Admiral Zeus from Planet Krull.

First of all, Bryan is more than a helicopter parent, he has a GPS inserted into his daughter's iPhone, so that he can track her. His ex-wife is separated from husband #2, but seems to forget him quite easily, and has her eyes on her ex.  Bryan must go to Budapest to guard a sheik, and invites his family to join him after his job is complete. Of course, the father of the bad guys Bryan killed previously in 'Taken 1', has his eyes on revenge. He plans on killing Bryan, and then discovers the entire family is in one place, what a coup!Bryan and his wife are kidnapped, while daughter, Kim stays at the hotel pool. Wife, Lenore is hung upside down with a slow bleed from her neck. Somehow, (this is the unbelievable part) while chained and shackled, Bryan is able to call daughter Kim and gives her explicit directions on how to find them. Not only did Kim fail two driving tests but she is somehow able to travel the streets of Budapest at very high speed, maneuver tight squeezes in the stolen cab and avoid getting them killed.

1511839,A1K6K23WG0IBWE,B0067EKYAY,Quadro Sinead Summer,"[0, 2]","Taken II suffers from the same problem 'Taken I' did. It's big on well choreographed action sequences, has good acting by Liam Neeson, nice locations, fairly good production qualities, directing, etc. But it lacks any common sense at all. Most action films where there are a lot of bullet's flying and car crashes require the viewer to suspend belief to a certain level. But these two films take excessive license with it, and often to laughable levels. I pretty much hated the first one. Though I found it very entertaining on a brainless sort of level with great action sequences, I simply could not get past the rediculous notion that a girl who's father worries something will happen to her get's kidnapped the second she shows up in Paris. She's literally targeted the very moment she lands. That sort of license pushes the envelope so far that it's insulting to the audience's common sense. That particular part of the script and the plot was pathetic and just plain stupid. Also the girl who played his daughter was very plastic and cheesy. I saw Taken II last night and did find it entertaining, and I liked it a little more than I liked the first one, but only because I already realized you have to leave all your brains at the door in order to enjoy it at all. In the first one she's just plastic and annoying. In this one she's not only plastic and annoying, but she's running around on rooftops throwing hand granades all over Istanbul, and driving getaway cars like a pro stunt driver when earlier on in the movie she's studying for her drivers license and can't even figure out how to park right. This one takes more license with the stupidity than the first one for sure. This is sort of like watching a John Woo or Michael Bay movie with slightly better production values. What I mean by that is that Woo and Bay action films usually cross the line into the rediculous and are generally rather out there. But thta is not to say Woo's earlier asian films were bad, they were really ok for what they were. But movies like Armageddon & The Rock for example are generally liked by a lot of people but are also hated by a lot of people. And if you hated those movies then you likely know where I am comming from. This is typical of the formula you expect from a Steven Seagal movie. Lots of action but short on brains. Also when I saw the first Taken I kept imagining Keifer Sutherland playing the main character. To all intents and purposes the Neeson character is a carbon copy of Jack Bauer, still I loved Neeson as this character. In fact without him the film would not be memorable for most people who like it now. The Taken movies play like cheesebal B style action movies, but still on a brainless action level both movies are pretty entertaining. So I hated and liked both movies, hence the 2 star rating.",2,Entertaining as long as you leave all your common sense somewhere else,1356393600,"12 25, 2012",2012,2825,"['Taken', 'II', 'suffers', 'same', 'problem', 'did', 'big', 'well', 'choreographed', 'action', 'sequences', 'good', 'acting', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'nice', 'locations', 'fairly', 'good', 'production', 'qualities', 'directing', 'etc', 'common', 'sense', 'Most', 'action', 'films', 'where', 'are', 'lot', 'bullet', 'flying', 'car', 'crashes', 'require', 'viewer', 'suspend', 'belief', 'certain', 'level', 'two', 'films', 'take', 'excessive', 'license', 'often', 'laughable', 'levels', 'pretty', 'much', 'hated', 'first', 'one', 'found', 'very', 'entertaining', 'brainless', 'sort', 'level', 'great', 'action', 'sequences', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'rediculous', 'notion', 'girl', 'who', 'father', 'worries', 'something', 'will', 'happen', 'get', 'kidnapped', 'second', 'up', 'Paris', 'literally', 'targeted', 'very', 'moment', 'sort', 'license', 'envelope', 'so', 'far', 'insulting', 'audience', 'common', 'sense', 'particular', 'part', 'script', 'plot', 'was', 'pathetic', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'Also', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'daughter', 'was', 'very', 'plastic', 'cheesy', 'saw', 'Taken', 'II', 'last', 'night', 'did', 'find', 'entertaining', 'liked', 'little', 'more', 'liked', 'first', 'one', 'only', 'already', 'realized', 'have', 'leave', 'brains', 'door', 'order', 'enjoy', 'first', 'one', 'just', 'plastic', 'annoying', 'one', 'not', 'only', 'plastic', 'annoying', 'running', 'around', 'rooftops', 'throwing', 'hand', 'granades', 'Istanbul', 'driving', 'getaway', 'cars', 'pro', 'stunt', 'driver', 'when', 'earlier', 'movie', 'studying', 'drivers', 'license', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'park', 'right', 'one', 'more', 'license', 'stupidity', 'first', 'one', 'sure', 'sort', 'watching', 'John', 'Woo', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'movie', 'slightly', 'better', 'production', 'values', 'What', 'mean', 'Woo', 'Bay', 'action', 'films', 'usually', 'cross', 'line', 'rediculous', 'are', 'generally', 'rather', 'there', 'thta', 'not', 'say', 'Woo', 'earlier', 'asian', 'films', 'were', 'bad', 'were', 'really', 'ok', 'what', 'were', 'movies', 'Armageddon', 'Rock', 'example', 'are', 'generally', 'liked', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'also', 'hated', 'lot', 'people', 'hated', 'movies', 'then', 'likely', 'know', 'where', 'am', 'comming', 'typical', 'formula', 'expect', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'movie', 'Lots', 'action', 'short', 'brains', 'Also', 'when', 'saw', 'first', 'Taken', 'kept', 'imagining', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'playing', 'main', 'character', 'intents', 'Neeson', 'character', 'carbon', 'copy', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'still', 'loved', 'Neeson', 'character', 'fact', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'memorable', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'now', 'Taken', 'movies', 'play', 'cheesebal', 'B', 'style', 'action', 'movies', 'still', 'brainless', 'action', 'level', 'movies', 'are', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'So', 'hated', 'liked', 'movies', 'hence', '2', 'star', 'rating']",N/A
1511840,A2JFKSHR0WQB8C,B0067EKYAY,QuickSilverSeven,"[3, 5]","Liam Neeson reprises his role as the lethal, always alert agent Bryan Mills, in Taken 2, and I'm very happy he's back, this being a welcome action role return for Neeson.The story follows the logical revenge plot of the villains' surviving Father, of who's sons Bryan took down in his determined venture to save his daughter from a network of slavers. This round, Bryan Mills enters Istanbul and his ex wife and daughter visit him just as the enemy is closing in.FAST CAMERA CUTS: 24 cuts every 10 seconds?Most of the action scenes of which there are plenty (car chase, foot chase, gun battles, hand to hand combat) directed by Oliver Megaton is up for debate. For example, when action begins, there seems to be a sequence of 20 film shots for every five seconds of film, resulting in an MTV like barrage of imagery. This can work if done right, but here, the action, although frantic and full of energy, becomes harder to follow for some viewers, myself included. Just think of the stealth take downs of Batman Begins to picture the style of elbow shots and hard to follow close ups, rendering the battle a series of hard to track motions that don't add up to a cohesive fight all the time.It comes down to the cinematography, director and editor to make sure the audience can easily follow the action, but here, it's a flash of close ups of steering wheel horns, motion blurred elbows with the occasionally well done distance shots so we understand where the character is in relation to the environment and enemy, Thankfully, the firearm battles are done better, the car chase is overall exciting, and the final fist fight, against a very tough and formidable enemy, results in a well done hand to hand battle (though the editing still leaves a question mark at it's conclusion). The final fight works, because the majority of camera shots show the full body of both fighters, avoiding the extreme close ups of an earlier battle. Why do I mention all of this? Because Taken 1 delivered consistently easy to follow, really well done action scenes.In the end, Taken 2 is an enjoyable follow up to Taken, and recommended for anyone who enjoyed the ever alert and ready to kick butt style of Neeson's Bryan Mills character.Taken 2 ends up being a decent action movie. If they make Taken 3, bring back the editor and team from Part 1.ACTION: 6/10.

1511847,A194GQYVY9HXUP,B0067EKYAY,Ray-Review,"[0, 0]","Being a huge fan of the first Taken, I was extremely skeptical of how the sequel would turn out. Knowing how Hollywood works, if there is a formula that works, Hollywood would take the liberty and try to milk the cow until it completely dries up. The original Taken (although not a  perfect film) was a great action thriller that had a simple premise but also had characters that were entertaining to watch thanks to the leading role of Liam Neeson.  The first film was about one man practically going against an entire army, going through whatever it takes to save his kidnapped daughter. Yes it was a very simple plot, but personally I found the execution to be thoroughly entertaining to watch.  The action was stellar, the scenarios were well thought out and most importantly you were watching the movie to the very end to make sure Liam Neeson's character does save his daughter.4 years later comes the release of Taken 2, the direct sequel. One thing I did appreciate about Taken 2 was the fact that the story didn't pull off a ""Hangover 2"" and just recreate the same movie in a different location. The plot, although familiar, was actually well thought out, and I believe that whomever took the time to write Taken 2 really thought of the best possible way to connect this film and the first Taken.  HOWEVER, what went wrong was simply the way the film was executed. The execution was very poor to say the very least and the director of this film should be ashamed of himself. Just about everything that made the first Taken so great, has suffered immensely in this second film. The only thing that saves this film from being absolute trash was the presence of Liam Neeson, but even he wasn't in top form. The acting from everybody including the great Liam Neeson felt incredibly flat; I just didn't feel the same sense of urgency as I did watching the first film which is awful because this movie is labeled as a thriller. The action sequences were horrid as well; I was glad I didn't catch this in the theaters because I am 100% sure that all the shaky fight scenes would have given me a headache. None of the villains in this movie were memorable whatsoever, I couldn't tell one guy from the other with the exception of the father of the sons Liam Neeson killed in the first movie, but I just didn't find him menacing, just annoying.As I am a fan of the first film, I found that Taken 2 was without a doubt an unnecessary movie that should not have been released. There were few instances where I found that the film succeeded as far as the plot, mainly in the middle of the film where Liam Neeson was instructing his daughter on how to find the location of him and her mother, but ultimately those scenes could not justify an entire 90 minutes of film. The film felt rushed and the acting was not done well at all; maybe if it was directed by a different person the film would've turned out decent but sadly this is what we have to settle with.",2,Taken Again,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,2955,"['Being', 'huge', 'fan', 'first', 'Taken', 'was', 'extremely', 'skeptical', 'how', 'sequel', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'Knowing', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'formula', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'take', 'liberty', 'try', 'milk', 'cow', 'completely', 'up', 'original', 'Taken', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'action', 'thriller', 'had', 'simple', 'premise', 'also', 'had', 'characters', 'were', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'thanks', 'leading', 'role', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'man', 'practically', 'going', 'entire', 'army', 'going', 'save', 'kidnapped', 'daughter', 'Yes', 'was', 'very', 'simple', 'plot', 'personally', 'found', 'execution', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'action', 'was', 'stellar', 'scenarios', 'were', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'most', 'importantly', 'were', 'watching', 'movie', 'very', 'end', 'make', 'sure', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'character', 'save', 'daughter.4', 'years', 'later', 'release', 'Taken', '2', 'direct', 'sequel', 'One', 'thing', 'did', 'appreciate', 'Taken', '2', 'was', 'fact', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', '2', 'just', 'recreate', 'same', 'movie', 'different', 'location', 'plot', 'familiar', 'was', 'actually', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'believe', 'took', 'time', 'write', 'Taken', '2', 'really', 'thought', 'best', 'possible', 'way', 'connect', 'film', 'first', 'Taken', 'HOWEVER', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'was', 'simply', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'executed', 'execution', 'was', 'very', 'poor', 'say', 'very', 'least', 'director', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'Just', 'everything', 'made', 'first', 'Taken', 'so', 'great', 'suffered', 'immensely', 'second', 'film', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'being', 'absolute', 'trash', 'was', 'presence', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'top', 'form', 'acting', 'everybody', 'including', 'great', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'felt', 'incredibly', 'flat', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'same', 'sense', 'urgency', 'did', 'watching', 'first', 'film', 'awful', 'movie', 'labeled', 'thriller', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'horrid', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'theaters', 'am', '100', '%', 'sure', 'shaky', 'fight', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'headache', 'None', 'villains', 'movie', 'were', 'memorable', 'whatsoever', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'one', 'guy', 'other', 'exception', 'father', 'sons', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'killed', 'first', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'menacing', 'just', 'annoying.As', 'am', 'fan', 'first', 'film', 'found', 'Taken', '2', 'was', 'doubt', 'unnecessary', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'were', 'few', 'instances', 'where', 'found', 'film', 'succeeded', 'as', 'far', 'plot', 'mainly', 'middle', 'film', 'where', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'was', 'instructing', 'daughter', 'how', 'find', 'location', 'mother', 'ultimately', 'scenes', 'could', 'not', 'justify', 'entire', '90', 'minutes', 'film', 'film', 'felt', 'rushed', 'acting', 'was', 'not', 'done', 'well', 'maybe', 'was', 'directed', 'different', 'person', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'turned', 'out', 'decent', 'sadly', 'what', 'have', 'settle']",N/A

And it wouldn't have been unreasonable for her to be severely traumatized by her experiences in that earlier film. But the Mills family are &#34;amicably separated&#34; and little Kimmie is about to take her driver's test, as well as dating a boy who Daddy's not sure he approves of. But while the three are tourists in Istanbul, the father of the human trafficker who Bryan killed in the process of revenge for Kim's abduction has just buried his son in Albania and now wants to show Bryan that &#34;payback is a moyobets&#34;--or however you render it in Albanian. Papa and his remaining sons catch up to Bryan and his ex while they're out shopping, with Kim deliberately back at the hotel so as to &#34;re-matchmake&#34; Mom and Dad. Bryan knows that some sort of attempt may also be made on Kim so he calls her to tell her to take preventative measures. Too late--she's already managed to elude attackers there and now proceeds to dash to Mom and Dad's rescue, coached by Bryan over the phone. Running across rooftops and throwing grenades every which way. At one point during the high-speed chase after reaching Bryan, Kim is the driver so Dad can shoot back at pursuers.

1511870,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B0067EKYAY,Robert Badgley,"[1, 2]","Taken 2(released Sept/12) stars Liam Neeson as Bryan Mills,Maggie Grace as Kim Mills,Famke Janssen as Lenore, and others.Neeson is back in his role,from the first film,as a retired special agent with ""many skills"".The action,when it roles,is fast and furious and the production team makes good use of the booming bass lines and noise emphasis that has become so popular in films these past few years,to ""enhance"" the on screen action.I have a problem with this film,but let's get into the plot first.The story has us all reunited with the Mills family in L.A.,and this time around there are two converging plots.One is that Neeson's ex is having problems with her new beau and his daughter is trying to get out of taking her driving test that she and daddy have been working on for some time.We switch over to a funeral in Albania where the father,a crime boss,and father of one o the kiddnappers from the first film,is laying to rest his son along with the others Neeson killed the first go round.The father wants revenge and revenge he shall get.Back in L.A.Neeson is off to Istanbul,Turkey to provide security for a wealthy Arab sheik.He had asked his ex and daughter to come along,but not hearing anything,flew over alone.He is surprised,once his work is done,to have them walk in on him in the hotel lobby.About 30 minutes into the film the Albanians follow and finally kidnap both Neeson and his wife.His daughter is back at the hotel in the swimming area.The couple have hoods over their heads in the kidnap van,but the ever vigilant Neeson counts the miles and keeps track of sounds he hears.They arrive at kidnap central and the wife is cut on the neck and turned upside down in chains to bleed to death,while Neeson,shackled,has to watch.Neeson has a small phone hidden and manages to call his daughter to tell her what has happened and to get to her fathers hotel room a.s.a.p..The kidnappers come but don't find her.Neeson and daughter reconnect and Neeson has his daughter plotting points on a map and throwing grenades to see how fast the sound reaches Neeson's ears.In short order his daughter has a fix on dad and finds the very chimney that falls down into his room.Neeson has meanwhile freed his wife and the gun his daughter throws down provides him with some defense.His daughter gets chased over rooftops by the kidnappers while Neeson leaves his wife to help his daughter.This he does and both commandeer a cab and return to the kidnap location.Neeson goes in but his wife has been taken away.Neeson and daughter are chased through the narrow Istanbul streets until they are able to reach the U.S.Embassy there and safety.Neeson leaves his daughter to return to find his wife.Neeson retraces his original trip in the van and finds kidnap central where his wife is.He fights his way in,finds his wife and leaves her once more to get to the leader.Neeson gives the man a choice to stop following he and his family,or otherwise be killed.When the man nods in agreement he drops his gun and the man picks the gun up and fires an empty gun at him.Neeson had of course taken the last bullet out.Neeson dispatches the father tout suite.The film ends with the family enjoying a dinner on,what looks suspiciously like,the Malibu Sports Fishing Pier.The film certainly has a lot of action to it and Neeson is stone cold,smart and calculating as before.However the prerequisite for an action film is believability.The first one had it in spades,that's why it was so good.This one had some disturbing lapses that had me mentally saying ""c'mon,you just didn't do that?"".One moment is when Neeson's daughter is fleeing their hotel and she goes straight to the basement,like she knows where she's going,she enters an employee locker area,opens one up and puts on the clothes inside(as to blend in) and leaves.I have never seen a better FITTING ensemble than she had on when leaving.That was NOT believable.Another issue is that of Neeson's daughter and her lack of driving license.It is assumed that she and her dad had been practicing for months in his car,but she had avoided getting her license.To top that knowing that most of the cars in California are automatics,it boggles the mind to watch her drive the stolen cab in narrow Istanbul streets like she was a pro,AND uses a stick shift,which she,at least as far as we know,knows nothing about!!?? Then there is the matter of Neeson's wife and her kidnapping.The fact that Neeson left her once to help his daughter is bad enough,but leaving her again is just so out of Neeson's character as to be totally unbelievable.It is funny that I bring this up because this DVD has an alternate ending to it,which I prefer.In it Neeson doesn't leave his wife the second time.In that version instead Neeson,after having helped his daughter and having returned to kidnap central to fetch his wife,he does indeed come back with her and all of them flee to the U.S.embassy instead of just Neeson and daughter in the theatrical version.The director has a comment before you watch the alternate ending that he preferred the theatrical cut,but thought this alternate provided better entertainment.Well I think he blew it.The alternate ending is the most believable and is most in keeping with Neeson's character.I could have maybe somewhat overlooked the daughter's cloths wearing and her pro like driving skills with a manual shift,but when the lead character does something that is so totally out of line with what he should normally be expected to do,especially a character like his that is so detailed oriented,then sorry I cannot buy into it.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include that alternate ending I told you about and an interview with Neeson on his promotional junket for the film.All in all,though the film has its good action moments and Neeson is in top form in his character,the film falters because of the producers letting the aforementioned incidents of unbelievability sneak into the film.I cannot fathom why the director,if they really KNEW the character of Bryan Mills,would they prefer a version that clearly goes against type? For the good of the film's integrity,the theatrical version's ending should have been the alternate,not the other way around.",3,Not up to its predecessor,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,6278,"['Taken',

The unrated cut in taken 2 is again living proof that the unrated version is the gold standard; I've yet to see any exception to that rule. As the basic blurb on the film synopsis indicates, the turnaround is that the parents get taken. The big difference in approximately the latter third of the film is that it takes an entirely different ambit to the theatrical cut (and I can honestly say that I can't see why they did the theatrical cut the way they did, but there is enough in the film extras if you to make up your own mind). Without giving too much away, they might have called this taken 2; the revenge: however it's more of a vendetta type of situation and I like the way the film has a fairly good pr&eacute;cis of the characters (on both sides) so you can see who has what motivation, and who were the ones that you are going to side with (obviously you are meant to side with Bryan Mills and his family). If you liked TAKEN ONE As Well as  Liam's film UNKNOWN, then I think you will really like the action, adventure, and exploration of a great deal of motivation in the agents.There is an alternative ending they supplied, which gives a radical change to the general feel of the film: it's about 25 minutes of fully complete material and has a radically different run in the motivation and action to the extent that you might even be able to get three films out of the entire material. There are five major deleted scenes in the extras, of which the foot chase is the longest and actually provides a lot of intriguing background, in my view. In one of two bonus materials there is a small discussion with Liam Neeson and it really gets into his motivation in the film (not necessarily his character's) as well as the way he works and what he likes about films; it's very enlightening. The final neat bonus is an in-depth animatic of the black ops box (the silver case he takes everywhere) and it is fairly obvious that is very well thought out. Overall, I was not sure if I was going to enjoy this film, due to a lot of negative reviews, but after watching the original TAKEN in saying the somewhat more thoughtful film UNKNOWN (which is based on a book, a spy thriller) I was willing to give TAKEN 2 a try, and I'm glad I did.

Suko cuts Bryan on the palm with his hidden knife.10) Most, if not all, of the fist fights between Bryan and the henchmen are longer and more brutal.11) Additional sound effects, e.g. throat gurgling, neck breakings, etc.., have been re-inserted.12) Most, if not all, action scenes involving people dying by firearms feature extra rounds fired into the victims.I enjoyed Taken 2.

1511911,A1DUT6O3BWXEJ,B0067EKYAY,"Shawn Gordon ""gordy the ghoul""","[1, 1]","On first inspection it would seem that Luc Besson runs a factory these days that dispenses one action movie after another. He has a stable of directors, cameramen, composers, editors, etc. that go from one product to another. there is a lack of imagination these days coming from the man behind the Fifth Element and the Professional, two great films that were more than a decade ago.Besson's latest director to hand films off to for assembly seems to be one Olivier Megatron, who helmed the mundane Transporter 3 and last year's excruciatingly dull Columbiana. To say that Taken 2 is his best effort so far isn't as much of a compliment as it sounds, it's more like stating a fact with little zeal.Taking place soon after the events of 2008's Taken, this time around the retired splenetic CIA man Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is vacating in Istanbul, Turkey when his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace) and ex-wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen), pull a surprise appearance. At the same time, the family of the cast of villains from the first movie come looking for some settling of scores. The new crop of Albanian heavies are led by Murad (Rade Serbedzja), the father of one of Neeson's targets the first time around.Mills and Lenore are taken hostage, while Kim searches for them. A sort of reversal of events from the last time around. Eventually, Mills escapes with his daughter's help and some handy grenades. He plots his own mission of ruthless revenge and retribution.Like it's predecessor, there is a lot of slick action here, everything is fairly neat and tidy, probably too much so. The action sequences are well staged, but there is an over emphasis on quick cut editing to assist the 60 year-old Nesson get through his physical work, that leaves the audience a little nauseated and dazed. Suspense is built through the menacing score by Nathanel Mechaly and the chases scenes are enhanced by solid editing. The camerawork from Besson regular Romain Lacourbas is decent, but workman like. They are also enough car crashes her to make Burt Reynolds salivate. I guess the anonymous stunt drivers should get some credit, good job guys.Once again the whole show really is Liam Neeson, an actor too good for this sort of material which he seems to do a lot of now, but he adds dignity and enhances what is essentially a 21st century Charles Bronson role. He works his way through some awkward situations and recycled dialogue from the first movie, but handles it with class that makes this more a pleasure to watch than it really deserves to be. Neeson, should get some better roles soon though, if he wishes to avoid following Nicolas Cage's poor example.Maggie Grace is unfortunately just too old for this role, she was too old the first time around, here she is really too old, like Channing Tatum-Jonah Hill too old. She's supposed to still be in high school and studying for her driving exam, but looks to be in her mid twenties. I usually don't complain about such things, except in cases like this where it becomes distracting. She also seems a little more awkward with her acting than before, perhaps because her character is so underwritten that she comes across as a little less than a half-wit.And poor Rade Serbedzja, a Serbian leading man and a fine actor, who is sadly given very little to do in a movie such as this. Much like the first go around, Taken 2 suffers from the lack of a strong central villain. There are plenty of anonymous badies for Neeson to off, but no one to create a real lasting impression. Action and thrillers are often made by a strong antagonist, think how James Bond movies are often defined by their villains.Famke Janssen, like last time, is again strictly window dressing.Megatron would appear to be the least of the filmmakers working in the Besson group these days, which makes it rather peculiar that he would place such an important title as Taken 2 in his clearly incapable hands. At least Pierre Morel, director of the previous movie had reasonably impressive skills at storytelling and greater strength in his dynamics.The script written by Besson and his frequent collaborator Robert Mark Karmen, who also wrote the first movie, is nothing to great either. Plodding and rehashing the original film a whole lot, when they aren't reusing situations and even dialogue, they at times resort to flashbacks.Overtly stylish like it's popular, but somewhat overrated predecessor, the Taken movies aim for a macho toughness like action pics of the past, but allow themselves to be undone by their anemic bloodletting and safe for mass consumption PG-13 violence, even in the unrated version. These movies lack the edge that it so desperately desires.Yet, at a well paced and reasonable length of ninety-two minutes, everything moves at a fast enough pace to forgive much of it's short comings, which there are many.  Taken 2 fails to make us care much about the characters or events on screen, but keeps us reasonable entertain none the less. But let it be known that where the first movie was an old song played at a different tempo, this time around it's strictly a cover version.Check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",2,strictly a

The first film was ham-handed, unbelievable, and also pretty unappetizing,with its ""white-slavery"" plot underpinning. But, as with anything Luc-Besson-related, it's all about the kinetic action.  And that's fine, if the director brings something to it. He doesn't, and the mawkish Hallmark family stuff just dumbs it down further.""Taken 2"" concerns itself even less with plot... it's just a relentless revenge tale, also clumsily directed.  In terms of believability, it makes any ""Die Hard"" movie look like a documentary.  I realize these movies are not about realism at all, but the car-chase scene, where the daughter (who failed her driving test 3 times) goes all Steve McQueen on the tiny twisty Istanbul streets, is ridiculous, and if the director was attempting to be ironic, he failed miserably.I think the worst thing, aside from the fact that no one in the film is at all likeable or remotely interesting, the film is totally devoid of humor. Suspense, thrills and humor CAN co-exist.  (witness: ""Die Hard""....the first one only!!)I DID actually watch both movies, got 'em from my library.

Why was his daughter's life worth killing so many people? Shouldn't he face some sort of punishment for his actions? Even if they were bad men, he still took the law into his own hands and killed them....

1511932,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B0067EKYAY,Steven Aldersley,"[6, 10]","I knew nothing about Taken when it was released in 2008, but it proved to be one of the best action movies I had ever seen. There was just enough information about the characters to care about them, and the action was intense and rather elegant.That shouldn't surprise me because Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen wrote the script. Besson had previously grabbed my attention with L&eacute;on: The Professional, which is one of the best action movies ever made. La Femme Nikita was another notable triumph. I mention all that to explain why I was already sold on the idea of Taken 2 as soon as it was announced.So, did it meet my lofty expectations?The opening scenes were something of a surprise with Brian Mills (Neeson) interacting with his ex-wife, Lenore (Janssen), and daughter, Kim (Grace) extensively. I like that we are shown how Mills has grown closer to Lenore. In the original movie, she was cold and spiteful, but the two are clearly on better terms now that Mills has used his skills to rescue Kim from her kidnappers. It made perfect sense and rang true for me.The plot is simple. If you remember Marko from the first movie, you'll probably know that he was part of an Albanian gang. In Taken 2, Marko's father is obsessed with avenging the death of his son. He's not interested in why Marko was killed, or that he was guilty of many crimes, he's only interested in seeing Mills killed. When Mills takes Lenore and Kim on vacation to Istanbul, Marko's father instructs his gang to capture Mills and his family. He partly succeeds, but Kim escapes.The opening setup is quite long and thorough, and I remember thinking that more than half the audience were probably anxious to see Neeson get on with the task of eliminating the opposition in as many unique and violent ways as possible. However, once the action starts, it's relentless and intense. We see car chases, shootouts, fights, threats, brief torture, and a rapidly increasing body count.Mills wants Kim to stay out of danger, but eventually enlists her help. I'm half expecting a sequel called 'Miss Taken.'It's unrealistic to expect a movie of this nature to be completely plausible. After all, the basic premise is that a 60-year-old man is capable of defeating gangs armed with automatic weapons. The method Mills uses to escape his kidnappers is so simple that I have to wonder why he didn't do it about 30 minutes earlier, but I'll forgive that.The ending was quite inventive, and paves the way for another sequel should Neeson and the cast want to reprise their roles a third time.I did have a few minor complaints, such as the kidnappers talking in English when it's obvious that they would stick to Albanian. Another minor annoyance was the use of shaky cam shots throughout most of the intense action scenes. There's a fine line between adding excitement and losing track of the events on the screen. The line was crossed a few times.Overall, I was happy with Taken 2. It delivered more of what I liked about the first movie and added depth to the relationships between the main characters. I don't think it's quite as good as Taken because we now know what Mills is capable of, and some of the pleasure of the first movie was seeing Mills demonstrate his unique set of skills for the first time.Taken 2 definitely works better if you have seen the first installment. Some of the actions and dialogue are direct references to events from the first movie, and you will miss some of the humor if you aren't aware of past events.Fans of Taken will be more than happy with this worthy sequel.Two things to remember:1) Never agree to go on vacation with Brian Mills.2) If Neeson uses your taxi cab, you probably won't see it in one piece again.",4,"A worthy sequel, without quite matching the original installment",1349481600,"10 6, 2012",2012,3719,"['knew', 'nothing', 'about', 'Taken', 'when', 'was', 'released', '2008', 'proved', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'action', 'movies', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'just', 'enough', 'information', 'characters', 'care', 'action', 'was', 'intense', 'rather', 'elegant.That', 'should', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'Robert', 'Mark', 'Kamen', 'wrote', 'script', 'Besson', 'had', 'previously', 'grabbed', 'attention', 'L', 'eacute', 'Professional', 'one', 'best', 'action', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'was', 'notable', 'triumph', 'mention', 'explain', 'why', 'was', 'already', 'sold', 'idea', 'Taken', '2', 'as', 'soon', 'was', 'announced.So', 'did', 'meet', 'lofty', 'expectations', 'opening', 'scenes', 'were', 'something', 'surprise', 'Brian', 'Mills', 'Neeson', 'interacting', 'ex-wife', 'Lenore', 'Janssen', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'Grace', 'extensively', 'like', 'are', 'shown', 'how', 'Mills', 'grown', 'closer', 'Lenore', 'original', 'movie', 'was', 'cold', 'spiteful', 'two', 'are', 'clearly', 'better', 'terms', 'now', 'Mills', 'used', 'skills', 'rescue', 'Kim', 'kidnappers', 'made', 'perfect', 'sense', 'rang', 'true', 'me.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'remember', 'first', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'know', 'was', 'part', 'Albanian', 'gang', 'Taken', '2', 'Marko', 'father', 'obsessed', 'avenging', 'death', 'son', 'not', 'interested', 'why', 'Marko', 'was', 'killed', 'was', 'guilty', 'many', 'crimes', 'only', 'interested', 'seeing', 'Mills', 'killed', 'When', 'Mills', 'Lenore', 'Kim', 'vacation', 'Istanbul', 'Marko', 'father', 'gang', 'capture', 'Mills', 'family', 'partly', 'Kim', 'escapes.The', 'opening', 'setup', 'quite', 'long', 'thorough', 'remember', 'thinking', 'more', 'audience', 'were', 'probably', 'anxious', 'see', 'Neeson', 'get', 'task', 'eliminating', 'opposition', 'as', 'many', 'unique', 'violent', 'ways', 'possible', 'However', 'once', 'action', 'relentless', 'intense', 'see', 'car', 'chases', 'shootouts', 'fights', 'threats', 'brief', 'torture', 'rapidly', 'increasing', 'body', 'count.Mills', 'Kim', 'stay', 'danger', 'eventually', 'help', ""'m"", 'half', 'expecting', 'sequel', 'called', ""'Miss"", 'Taken', 'unrealistic', 'expect', 'movie', 'nature', 'be', 'completely', 'plausible', 'basic', 'premise', '60-year-old', 'man', 'capable', 'defeating', 'gangs', 'armed', 'automatic', 'weapons', 'method', 'Mills', 'escape', 'kidnappers', 'so', 'simple', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', '30', 'minutes', 'earlier', ""'ll"", 'forgive', 'that.The', 'ending', 'was', 'quite', 'inventive', 'way', 'sequel', 'should', 'Neeson', 'cast', 'want', 'reprise', 'roles', 'third', 'time.I', 'did', 'have', 'few', 'minor', 'complaints', 'such', 'kidnappers', 'talking', 'English', 'when', 'obvious', 'would', 'stick', 'Albanian', 'minor', 'annoyance', 'was', 'use', 'shaky', 'cam', 'shots', 'most', 'intense', 'action', 'scenes', 'fine', 'line', 'adding', 'excitement', 'losing', 'track', 'events', 'screen', 'line', 'was', 'crossed', 'few', 'times.Overall', 'was', 'happy', 'Taken', '2', 'delivered', 'more', 'what', 'liked', 'first', 'movie', 'added', 'depth', 'relationships', 'main', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'Taken', 'now', 'know', 'what', 'Mills', 'capable', 'pleasure', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'seeing', 'Mills', 'demonstrate', 'unique', 'set', 'skills', 'first', 'time.Taken', '2', 'definitely', 'better', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'installment', 'actions', 'dialogue', 'are', 'direct', 'references', 'events', 'first', 'movie', 'will', 'miss', 'humor', 'are', ""n't"", 'aware', 'past', 'events.Fans', 'Taken', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'happy', 'worthy', 'sequel.Two', 'things', 'remember:1', 'Never', 'agree', 'go', 'vacation', 'Brian', 'Mills.2', 'Neeson', 'taxi', 'cab', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'one', 'piece', 'again']",N/A

While the sequel isn't as good (very few sequels are), it's good at what it's meant for - a vicious, unrelenting action/revenge movie.Bryan Mills has just finished an assignment in Istanbul, when his ex-wife Lenore (who's having marriage problems with her current rich husband) and his daughter Kim, surprise him at the hotel.  The movie gets crazy quick, as family members from the slain Albanians from the first film attempt to snatch all three.  They succeed with Bryan and Lenore but fail to snatch Kim, due to a call from Bryan.Through guiding Kim, Bryan is able to help her aid in his escape, fight his way through bad guys, and so the movie goes.  It culminates after an hour of fist-fights and more gunplay with a great Krav Maga-style fight between Bryan Mills and the right-hand man of Murad, the Albanian Mob Boss.  Bryan then confronts and kills Murad, and leaves with Lenore to rejoin Kim.For plot, the movie feels less effective than its predecessor, but for action, it is well-paced and enough to serve its purpose as an action movie.",4,Taken 2-ish...,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,1220,"['POSSIBLE', 'SPOILERS', 'FOLLOWOk', 'Taken', 'was', 'great', 'action', 'movie', 'was', 'fresh', 'was', 'action', 'packed', 'starred', 'formidable', 'character', 'former', 'CIA', 'Agent', 'Bryan', 'Mills', 'sequel', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'very', 'few', 'sequels', 'are', 'good', 'what', 'meant', 'vicious', 'unrelenting', 'action/revenge', 'movie.Bryan', 'Mills', 'just', 'finished', 'assignment', 'Istanbul', 'when', 'ex-wife', 'Lenore', 'who', 'having', 'marriage', 'problems', 'current', 'rich', 'husband', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'surprise', 'hotel', 'movie', 'crazy', 'quick', 'family', 'members', 'slain', 'Albanians', 'first', 'film', 'attempt', 'snatch', 'three', 'succeed', 'Bryan', 'Lenore', 'fail', 'snatch', 'Kim', 'due', 'call', 'Bryan.Through', 'guiding', 'Kim', 'Bryan', 'able', 'help', 'aid', 'escape', 'fight', 'way', 'bad', 'guys', 'so', 'movie', 'hour', 'fist-fights', 'more', 'gunplay', 'great', 'Krav', 'Maga-style', 'fight', 'Bryan', 'Mills', 'right-hand', 'man', 'Murad', 'Albanian', 'Mob', 'Boss', 'Bryan', 'then', 'confronts', 'kills', 'Murad', 'Lenore', 'rejoin', 'Kim.For', 'plot', 'movie', 'less', 'effective', 'predecessor', 'action', 'well-paced', 'enough', 'serve', 'purpose', 'action', 'movie']",N/A

Basically, the family patriarch back in the old country, Albania, finishes burying what remains of the scumbags Brian wiped out in Paris, and vows revenge. He seems to be some kind of mafia godfather who has the usual connections in high places. He quickly finds Brian's location, on a long weekend with `Lenny', his ex-wife and Kim, his once airheaded daughter, in Istanbul, where Brian's just finished protecting the family of some uber rich oil sheik or similar, and starts off to find him with a second cohort of equally nasty scumbags in tow.Having bribed his way through typically corrupt officials high and low the patriarch sets up camp in what looks like a deserted and run down Istanbul apartment. The apartment block itself looked to be in a very similar part of town to that which both Tom Cruise, in Night and Day, and Clive Owen, in the International, visited. Obviously, the roof tops of old Istanbul provide a good location in which to shoot the odd roof top set piece.Anyway, having located his prey said patriarch and minions duly `take' Brian and Lenny, in order to fulfil his and the film's mission and truss them up with chains and such like in what looks like the apartment block's basement. Then, being conveniently incompetent, leave them alone with a conveniently incompetent sleepy headed scumbag guard outside. Kim, who, during the film's opening, had received a driving lesson from Brian back in LA, has managed to avoid being captured, by stealing a taxi, and also manages to retrieve Brian's mini arsenal of assault weapons. Brian gives her instructions - yeh, they are able to communicate; I won't say how - and sets about enabling Brian to let her home in on his exact location!Kim duly retrieves Brian and, now performing like a seasoned rally driver, picks him up at the start of the obligatory car chase through the old streets and alley ways of Istanbul.Obviously, I can't say how this all turns out but I'm sure you can guess!

It feels like the entire film was rushed from conception to production right away. The story is just a terrible copy from the first but with zero depth. The whole idea that a criminal organization would want to get justice for the families of the people you killed just seems stupid to put it mildly. Since when did people who kidnap young women and sell them to the highest bidder for prostitution have morals? Do their families think they were killed selling Bibles or something? That's how stupid the entire premise of Taken 2 is.

In a different movie this story line would have made this man the hero.

What if, after a relatively short amount of time, you're flung back into a very similar circumstance? I don't imagine that would help.Sometime after returning to the relative safety of Los Angeles, Bryan Mills (played by Liam Neeson), his ex-wife Lenore (played by Famke Janssen) and their daughter Kim (played by Maggie Grace) are still rebounding from the trauma they suffered. Bryan (Neeson) arrives at Kim's home to give her a driving lesson only to be informed that she is not even in the house. She's with her boyfriend. A boyfriend Bryan knew nothing about, no less. Simultaneously, in Tropoje, Albania, Murad Hoxha, father of deceased kidnapper and human trafficker Marko Hoxha, is attending a funeral service being conducted for his son and his accomplices. Murad (played by Rade Serbedzija) vows to avenge the deaths of his son and his friends. After hearing that a planned vacation to China is cancelled by Lenore's now estranged husband, Bryan invites both Kim and Lenore to join him on a business trip in Istanbul once he's fulfilled his professional obligations. They arrive sooner than expected and, unbeknownst to them, followed by Murad's henchman. Following a family lunch in the marketplace, Kim returns to the hotel. It's immediately apparent to Bryan and Lenore that their daughter hopes privacy and the exotic locale will rekindle feelings of love in her long-divorced parents. While romance does seem to be in bloom between the couple, it is abruptly halted when Murad and his men make their play for the Mills family.Now, I was and still am a huge fan of the 2008 film. I believe Neeson took a film that would've seemed dull and uninspired in the hands of Jason Statham, Vin Diesel, or any other contemporary action star and elevated it beyond the material. This film, while entertaining and plausible enough for an action/adventure, is the lesser of the two. Of course, there's the fact that it's more of the same and, therefore, less interesting. In addition, while the original depended on Neeson's estimable talent, this film relies heavily on Maggie Grace. A competent actress, sure, but nowhere near as good as Liam Neeson.

A retired CIA agent Bryan Mills is back and Liam Neeson once again brings gravitas to the role that made him an action star about four years ago, but the script of ""Taken 2"" (written by Luc Besson and his long-time collaborator Robert Mark Kamen) looks more like a reenactment of the original's story set in a more exotic Istanbul location and seen from a different viewpoint.The story is simple. Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is on business trip in Istanbul, where he is reunited with his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) and daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Then a band of vengeful Albanian gangsters led by Murad (Rade Sherbedgia) arrives with guns, to avenge the deaths of the men that Mills killed in ""Taken.""Now I am not saying that ""Taken 2"" is a bad movie. The film is slick and action-packed, though action sequences tend to be less credible and thrilling because of choppy editing and our familiarity with the story. As the original's freshness and novelty is gone, the sequel (that looks more like a remake) is more predictable, treading on familiar paths and not veering into new territory, except when Neeson's character is given a rare moment to show his vulnerability.After all, if there is one reason you should see ""Taken 2,"" it is Liam Neeson showing what a talented actor like him really can do.

The main difference is that Bryan Mill's (Liam Neeson) family plays a much larger role in the sequel. While the first movie is about a lone wolf taking out bad guys like gnats on a summer day to get his daughter back, this one involves the family unit, so the experience, while using incredible action scenes, is a bit different.There is also a little more down time in this film, as cheesy tender moments are used to work the audience up before mother and father are abducted by a psychotic terrorist hellbent on getting revenge as a result of Bryan killing his son.This film provides tons of kills, explosions and everything else that makes a movie good, and it has some real cheese in it, leading up to the action you're wanting. I say go see this film. I didn't enjoy it as much as the first one because I'd rather see Bryan go it alone, but this is still a great action film. I liked it enough to want there to be a third installment.As for the cheese in the film, the script is pretty bad, especially the dialogue between father and daughter, father and ex-wife before the movie gets rolling, but Liam Neeson is a great actor, so he saves it from veering off to Dolph Lundgren or Steven Segal territory (Hey, I'm not saying their movies are bad, just saying the dialogue is).Anyway, if you love action and like family films, this is the one for you, brother.",4,For the Action Man and Family Man,1349827200,"10 10, 2012",2012,1453,"['original', 'Taken', 'was', 'incredible', 'movie', 'Taken', '2', 'got', 'incredible', 'moments', 'main', 'difference', 'Bryan', 'Mill', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'family', 'much', 'larger', 'role', 'sequel', 'first', 'movie', 'lone', 'wolf', 'taking', 'out', 'bad', 'guys', 'gnats', 'summer', 'day', 'get', 'daughter', 'back', 'one', 'family', 'unit', 'experience', 'using', 'incredible', 'action', 'scenes', 'bit', 'also', 'little', 'more', 'down', 'time', 'film', 'cheesy', 'tender', 'moments', 'are', 'used', 'work', 'audience', 'up', 'mother', 'father', 'are', 'abducted', 'psychotic', 'terrorist', 'hellbent', 'getting', 'revenge', 'result', 'Bryan', 'killing', 'son.This', 'film', 'tons', 'kills', 'explosions', 'everything', 'else', 'movie', 'good', 'real', 'cheese', 'leading', 'up', 'action', ""'re"", 'wanting', 'say', 'go', 'see', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'first', 'one', ""'d"", 'rather', 'see', 'Bryan', 'go', 'alone', 'still', 'great', 'action', 'film', 'liked', 'enough', 'want', 'be', 'third', 'installment.As', 'cheese', 'film', 'script', 'pretty', 'bad', 'especially', 'dialogue', 'father', 'daughter', 'father', 'ex-wife', 'movie', 'rolling', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'great', 'actor', 'veering', 'off', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'Steven', 'Segal', 'territory', 'Hey', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'movies', 'are', 'bad', 'just', 'saying', 'dialogue', '.Anyway', 'love', 'action', 'family', 'films', 'one', 'brother']",N/A

While not quite as good as the first film which blew on the scene somewhat unexpectantly, ""Taken 2"" still manages to be breezy entertainment with Liam Neeson dong what he does best in action films--beating the bad guys at their own game.SPOILERS:While in Istanbul ex-CIA agent Bryan Mills (Neeson), his ex-wife (Famke Janssen--somebody give this underrated actress another film with some substance--please!) are kidnapped by the father (Rade Serbedzija)of one of the men he killed in the first movie. Mills must rely on his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace who, at 27, is getting a wee bit too old for these roles)to help him escape and rescue his wife.END OF SPOILERS:""Taken 2"" certainly doesn't break any new ground and it's not the unexpected back-to-basics thriller that the first one was but it's enjoyable on its own terms. The action sequences are well directed although this film, unlike the first, seems a bit like all the other recent action thrillers released in terms of staging and stunts. The editing is a bit more choatic, again, much like most of the other action films we've seen over the last decade and while does a adequate job, he lacks the flair of Pierre Morel who made the first film.Having said that, it is tough to direct a sequel to a popular film like ""Taken"" because the expectations the first film (which came as a bit of a surprise to many) aren't there. ""Taken 2"" is still fun particularly as a mindless way to spent a rainy afternoon or if you're at home sick.The blu-ray looks particularly nice particularly some of the beautifully shot establishing shots of L.A. and Istanbul. Detail is abundant and there's quite a bit of detail evident in this crisp presentation of the film.The audio is equally impressive with a nice, immersive soundtrack with dialogue STILL remaining clear. We get a variety of subtitles for the film including English, Spanish and, of all things, Mandarin.The special features includes a ""Black Ops Field Manual"" (this is only available on the unrated version) which acts as a clever pop up option with background info on the film.We also get deleted scenes and alternate ending that provides an interesting, slightly different taste to the conclusion of the film.We can also browse through Mills' weapons case and learn about each one.""In Character with Liam Neeson"" is from FX Movie Channel and is a fluff piece where the actor discusses his character.We also get the theatrical trailer and, for those using BD Live, Fox gives them an exclusive making of featurette which I didn't watch.Is ""Taken 2"" a worthwhile investment to buy? That depends on how much of a fan of this film you are. It certainly is entertaining and engaging.If you're in doubt perhaps a rental would be the first best choice.

His performance is what carries the show.  In this sequel, the filmmakers are able to replicate pretty much the same scenarios as that original and get away with it because of the raw emotion involved in both the stories and the characters.For a basic plot summary, ""Taken 2"" sees the same gang that abducted Kim (Maggie Grace) in the first movie now looking for revenge against parents Brian (Neeson) and Lenore (Famke Janssen).There are two reasons why this film works so well despite using much of the same subject matter as the original:1. The emotions behind the simple revenge-based plot are so visceral.  Grace's persona of Kim is so innocent (but yet true-to-life) that one cannot help but root for her either to be the hero or the one being saved by the hero.  Simply put, she's the on-screen daughter that everyone wants to protect.2. With that first crucial plot step in place, Neeson's magnificent character is given a chance to shine.  With Grace providing the dramatic moments, Neeson brings the action and intensity with a passion.  Film buffs recently learned that Neeson's distinctive baritone means nothing without a great plot/drama behind it (see: ""Unknown"").  When given the opportunity to hone his character, though, Neeson can provide relentless intensity with as little as a few words.Overall, ""Taken 2"" is a strong sequel to the original.  It pretty much contains all the ""same stuff"" as the first one, but the characters are still relatable and the action is still top-notch.

1512005,A1S1BJFTA644TU,B0067EKYAY,Zalmorion the Fantastic,"[0, 1]","Basically, this is a decent action movie.  Nothing more.  The story is basic.  Nothing interesting or thrilling.  Taken was spectacular.  I think the reason this movie is not that great is that the daughter and wife get in the way.  We want to see Liam's character do what he does best.  There are not enough fights in this film.  Instead he needs his civilian daughter's help.  Boring.In fact, the plot falls flat in a few really silly and fundamental ways.He invites his family (ex-wife included) to a place we all know today is a Muslim trouble zone just waiting to become a launching pad for terrorists.  Why would a wise black ops operative do that?  Silly.  Unless, like most divorced men and women, he was secretly hoping his ex would get captured.  But then that would make this a comedy.Also, he has all these interesting friends with histories akin to his own, but they NEVER get used!  Why are you showing us his friends??? (Who are played by some really talented actors, by the way).  What a waste of some neat teamwork scenes or innovative spy-in-the-field scenes.Also, why the hell are we subjected to his daughter's boyfriend?  What plot purpose does he serve?  Don't waste my time.Lastly, the guys he fights are not very spectacular.  Just a bunch of street bums and thugs really.  Wouldn't it have been interesting if the Chinese or Russians had stepped in to cause a little trouble for an American agent who has evaded them on their own soil and made them look foolish in spy operations of the past?  Maybe some special agents to help out the kidnappers and give Liam's character some real opponents?  As it is, his toughest fight is against a short squat guy who looks like he makes pizza in Hoboken, New Jersey.  And his vanquishing of the main evil antagonist was literally as easy as hanging a coat in a coat closet.  You'll understand when you see it.The film would have been much better if Liam had been forced to deal with the Mexican cartels who kidnap innocents from America even as we speak.  Leave his family at home.  They appeared in the first movie and that was all we needed to see of them.  Give us some interesting plot twists that involve the the dirty underground of spies and internation criminals or something.  Not a silly vacation gone bad.

1512008,AB1CKA6B849SP,B0067EKYAY,zeus,"[1, 1]","This film is a sequel to Taken and like most sequels (except for the Goodfather) is not as good as the first movie. Surprisingly, it has nothing to do with the acting or the story but with the direction.The plot is simple and happens in Istanbul. The father of Marco from Tropoa wants revenge. He puts together a band of thugs from his third world country and comes to Istanbul where he has access to everything: from the government officials to the police (people in third world countries help each other...). Byan Milles (Liam Neesom) is vacationing in Istanbul with his ex-wife and daughter. His ex-wife just got separated from her husband.The movie had potential and the acting of all participants is really outstanding. However, the direction is really terrible. The fight scenes are really well done but the views from one cameras to the other are multiple and unnecessary. I don't know who did the final cut of the movie, but the person is totally incompetent. And that started with the opening titles, when the bodies are flown to Albania. There are so many camera angles/changes that make you really dizzy. At first I said, OK this it is an exception, poorly done but just the beginning, it will get better. Absolutely not! During the first fight in the market, just before he is taken, I had to close my eyes several times and look away because it made me dizzy and I wanted to puke.  I am not sure who decided to have 20-30 cameras for one fight and have an angle shown from each one at least once, but that was a bad idea; it is a total failure. I have seen Colombiana which was directed by Olivier Megaton and I know Luc Besson was involved in the making of the movie. Never had any problems with Colombiana and I have seen several movies by Luc Besson (the Big Blue, the Fifth Element) and was really happy with his plot and direction. I was really surprised by these deficiencies in this movie.Zero stars for the direction, five stars for the acting and four stars for the script. Overall three stars.Taken 3 is in the works. Hopefully they will choose another director.
