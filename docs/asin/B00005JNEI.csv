I chose not to see this in the movies because of reports of ultra-violent gun-toting right wing neoconservative freaks threatening and harassing decent movie-goers and I didn't want to get arrested by corrupt redneck jackbooted cops for kicking all their asses.Instead, I bought the DVD, but not from Amazon. I have already been successful in changing the minds of over ninety two voters who were either planning on not voting, considering voting for Bushmonkey or, for some ill-conceived notion, voting for Nader.What I am going to do now is buy many, many copies from Amazon and mail them out to various groups, clubs, etc. that I know so they can learn the truth and change their minds too.The great thing about Fahrenheit 911 is that it presents factual information to the viewing public who is sick of getting slanted news from the corporate media giants such as Fox and CBS. Moore investigates the issues thoroughly and presents them clearly and concisely. It also doesn't hurt that he's a near comic genius.I've investigated these issues myself and have found Moore to be completely accurate in every instance. He represents the truth whereas FOX and Headrush Limbaugh spew venomous lies to unsuspecting dipsh*ts who shovel it into their slackjawed mugs like fools.Watch Michael Moore's brilliant documentary Fahrenheit 911 and learn the evil truth behind the Bush dictatorship's foreign policy protocol.Bush has no values.

Hard for me to say from way over here in China.My biggest complaint about this movie is that I can't spell Fahrenheit. How'd that first 'h' get in there? Yeah, it's a guy's name. But still. I bet Ray Bradbury, his editor, or both, used a dictionary when they worked on Fahrenheit 451. Maybe Celsius 9/11 would be a better title. I can spell that.Last week, a friend whose writing I greatly admire asked me an interesting question. Is this movie as popular in China as it is in the U.S.? My answer was that I don't know because I haven't found the theater in Shaoxing yet.The film's getting the ink over here. But I doubt it's in the Chinese theaters yet. They don't just whack in subtitles. They dub every film in Chinese, a source of justifiable pride. So time is required.On the other hand, I saw the VCD in a video store and snagged it. I prefer DVDs, but they didn't have one. I bought the DVDs of ROGER & ME and BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE in Hangzhou, and I recently ordered DUDE, WHERE'S MY COUNTRY? (a book) from Amazon.All the DVDs and VCDs here have a number of language options, and if the original film is in English, one option for the audio will be English.(Except for HAMLET with Sir Lawrence Olivier -- he only speaks Chinese. All these years that you thought he was British, you were mistaken.)We know what Michael Moore's going to do before we watch any of his films or read any of his books, don't we? He's gonna find some facts, mix in some opinions, and make us think. I suppose if you like someone he's aimed at, the thinking parts gets a wee bit painful.It may surprise you to know that Michael Moore always gets a few laughs out of me. Since TV NATION. His subjects can be so serious that some viewers are just stunned or outraged. But I laughed at FAHRENHEIT 9/11 several times.I enjoy ""reviewing"" something that you've already heard about. It saves me the trouble of recapping the plot before I go into my opinionated spouting mode.I read an article in a Fayetteville (North Carolina) newspaper about how this was surprisingly popular in that Fort Bragg town. It included the line ""Twelve other theaters in North Carolina are carrying 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' according to the film's Web site.""What? You mean only 13 theaters in all of North Carolina are showing this? Would it really have been harder for me to watch it if I hadn't moved to China? Please don't make me confess my deep dark secret, that I was born in Fayettenam, I mean Fayettehell, I mean Fayetteville.I'm glad FAHREINHEIT 9/11 was released in an election year. When I left the U.S., the First Amendment guaranteed freedom of speech. It's nice to know Bush hasn't repealed it yet.Oh, and I think Michael Moore should be grateful he's not Chinese. I have to throw that in, lest the knee-jerk right-wingers think I've been brainwashed or something.",3,Fahrenheit 9/11,1156723200,"08 28, 2006",2006,2935,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'go', 'see', 'away', 'available', 'town', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Hard', 'say', 'way', 'here', 'China.My', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'spell', 'Fahrenheit', 'How', ""'d"", 'first', 'h', 'get', 'there', 'Yeah', 'guy', 'name', 'still', 'bet', 'Ray', 'Bradbury', 'editor', 'used', 'dictionary', 'when', 'worked', 'Fahrenheit', '451', 'Maybe', 'Celsius', '9/11', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'title', 'can', 'spell', 'that.Last', 'week', 'friend', 'writing', 'greatly', 'admire', 'asked', 'interesting', 'question', 'movie', 'popular', 'China', 'U.S.', 'answer', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'have', ""n't"", 'found', 'theater', 'Shaoxing', 'yet.The', 'film', 'getting', 'ink', 'here', 'doubt', 'Chinese', 'theaters', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'whack', 'subtitles', 'dub', 'film', 'Chinese', 'source', 'justifiable', 'pride', 'time', 'required.On', 'other', 'hand', 'saw', 'VCD', 'video', 'store', 'snagged', 'prefer', 'DVDs', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'bought', 'DVDs', 'ROGER', 'ME', 'BOWLING', 'FOR', 'COLUMBINE', 'Hangzhou', 'recently', 'ordered', 'DUDE', 'WHERE', 'MY', 'COUNTRY', 'book', 'Amazon.All', 'DVDs', 'VCDs', 'here', 'have', 'number', 'language', 'options', 'original', 'film', 'English', 'one', 'option', 'audio', 'will', 'be', 'English', 'HAMLET', 'Sir', 'Lawrence', 'Olivier', 'only', 'Chinese', 'years', 'thought', 'was', 'British', 'were', 'mistaken', 'know', 'what', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'going', 'do', 'watch', 'films', 'read', 'books', 'do', ""n't"", 'gon', 'find', 'facts', 'mix', 'opinions', 'make', 'think', 'suppose', 'like', 'someone', 'aimed', 'thinking', 'parts', 'wee', 'bit', 'painful.It', 'may', 'surprise', 'know', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'always', 'few', 'TV', 'NATION', 'subjects', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'serious', 'viewers', 'are', 'just', 'stunned', 'outraged', 'laughed', 'FAHRENHEIT', '9/11', 'several', 'times.I', 'enjoy', 'reviewing', 'something', ""'ve"", 'already', 'heard', 'trouble', 'recapping', 'plot', 'go', 'opinionated', 'spouting', 'mode.I', 'read', 'article', 'Fayetteville', 'North', 'Carolina', 'newspaper', 'how', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'popular', 'Fort', 'Bragg', 'town', 'included', 'line', 'Twelve', 'other', 'theaters', 'North', 'Carolina', 'are', 'carrying', ""'Fahrenheit"", '9/11', 'according', 'film', 'Web', 'site.', 'What', 'mean', 'only', '13', 'theaters', 'North', 'Carolina', 'are', 'showing', 'Would', 'really', 'have', 'been', 'harder', 'watch', 'had', ""n't"", 'moved', 'China', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'confess', 'deep', 'dark', 'secret', 'was', 'born', 'Fayettenam', 'mean', 'Fayettehell', 'mean', 'Fayetteville.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'FAHREINHEIT', '9/11', 'was', 'released', 'election', 'year', 'When', 'left', 'U.S.', 'First', 'Amendment', 'guaranteed', 'freedom', 'speech', 'nice', 'know', 'Bush', ""n't"", 'repealed', 'yet.Oh', 'think', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'should', 'be', 'grateful', 'not', 'Chinese', 'have', 'throw', 'knee-jerk', 'right-wingers', 'think', ""'ve"", 'been', 'brainwashed', 'something']",Fahrenheit 9/11
629701,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00005JNEI,Acute Observer,"[6, 10]","Fahrenheit 9/11Documentaries lie on the continuum between fact and fiction. They attempt to recreate the known facts. You decide how well it is done. The opening says the following Interviews and Commentaries are for entertainment, the views and opinions belong to the individual speakers. The film starts by predicting a victory in Florida for Al Gore, then the networks change their projection and declare a Bush victory. Over what time span? [If Gore won his home state of Tennessee he would have been President.] Why did NO US Senator sign on to that petition? Was the fix in? People protested at the Inauguration. Bush was the vacationing President.On September 11, 2001 two airplanes crashed into the World Trade Center towers. [Bush looks clueless after receiving the news.] The film asks whether Saudi money went to George W. when his father was President. Were there any other connections? What about the Carlyle Group? The attack on the WTC meant a larger military budget. There are connections between the Bush family and the Saudi royal family. Why did Bush use 9/11 as an excuse to attack Iraq? Can fear be used to scare people and justify government oppression? The FBI knew Al Qaeda had supporters in America who were taking flying lessons. Do Congressmen read the laws before they vote for them?The film shows the ""collateral damage"" on the people of Iraq. Brittany Spears trusts Bush, why don't you? The Bush administration said there was no threat from Iraq in 2001. Was this a mistake? Is the high unemployment in parts of America a way to generate troops for the military? Then we see the invasion of a house in Iraq to find a suspect. ""What did he do?"" Why do they hate our troops in Iraq? Why did Bush try to cut wages and benefits for soldiers? Will the bombing of Iraq create business opportunities in rebuilding Iraq? Would Iraq be invaded if there was no oil? Should Congress ask their children to join the Army? These are all good questions.There is a quote from George Orwell about the need for war to keep a ruling group in power. Orwell was a cynic, peace is more likely to keep a regime in power. A loss in war usually leads to regime change, as in 1952 and 1968. What about 2008? This film is sort of slow-paced, but that is the result of using facts and not staged events. It provides reports that you won't see on corporate television. After Reagan was elected he raised the lowest tax bracket from 9% to 15%. Social Security taxes were raised by 50%. This allowed the highest tax rate to be cut by 50%. Most people were taxed more so the wealthiest could be taxed less. Real wages fell as well. These economic policies led to today's recession.

629703,A3LF2DJ3LEGJ9H,B00005JNEI,"Adam Theo ""Adam THEO""","[1, 4]","The movie was pretty good. There are plenty of critiques of the factuality of the movie's statements, so I won't bother with those. Instead, I'll talk about my opinions of the style and content.It begins very well. It's easy to follow as long as you pay attention, and keeps a good fast pace. It slows down dramatically when the story visits Moore's hometown and goes on to cover the soldiers fighting in Iraq.It's almost like the coverage of his hometown and Iraq is a different movie, inserted into the middle of the real show. It's different in pace, style, and purpose. As I mentioned above, it's a slow pace. It also tries to illicit sorrow and emotional pain with the audience, with scenes and stories about loss of loved ones and ruined lives. Perhaps he should have made a separate movie about the personal loss, as a tribute and healing aid to those families and individuals who have had so much taken away from them by this war. The slower, more deliberate pace would have been well served with this separate movie.But, that aside, the rest of the movie was very entertaining. It definitely makes George W. Bush look like a complete and total idiot with multiple clips of media coverage. I do believe that Bush is an idiot, and am ashamed of him being our president just for that alone. There are those who claim those clips are taken out of context, without any of Bush's intelligent moments taken into account as well. I defend my view against that by pointing out that the simple fact that Bush has said and done those things, out of context or not, shows he's a selfish idiot. No caring, intelligent person would have spoken or done most of the things Bush is shown in the movie, whether they were at a formal dinner or hanging out with friends. A competent president wouldn't make those mistakes, or at least would be competent enough to minimize the damage. Bush isn't competent.The final comment I have on the movie is about the opening scene where he tries to make many of the Bush administration's officials look foolish as they prepare to be on camera. Paul Wolfowitz using his own saliva to comb his hair is an example. I've been working in TV broadcasting for almost a year now, and I've seen stranger. I also say ""So what? Do whatever works to get ready.""

629704,A1HOMI8CVEBV40,B00005JNEI,"Adaptation ""Chopstick""","[11, 16]","Honestly! If your a republican, then WHY do you act so surprised when it offends you? Now I'm not gonna attack republicans, this is a DVD review, but.....just a little word of advice. If you didn't like the movie, or if you are a Pro-Bush person, Don't give me a hard time, ITS JUSt A REVIEW, and to be fair and balanced, I will actually take the Republican perspective as a sub review.Democratic View:Okay, When I saw this movie, I thought the beginning was a little commercialised, but it was well made. When Mike Moore does a film, he always starts with a very good beginning. As the film progresses, we see all that we thought had happened, but never really confirmed. Yes, Bush did actually take a vacation the first days in office, I actually have the taped news report from 2000, and no, it definatly wasn't FOX. With the progression of the film we also bear whitness to alot of opinions from a wide variety of people, the most compelling to me, was the homless woman, screaming at the white house, one of those moments. Also, another thing that was brought to our knowlege is that, however ""Brave"" our solders are...They are mostly men. and alot of those men joined the army as some gung-ho fancey. Now don't get me wrong, some of our troops have joined for noble causes, but there are those few, racist, wicked men, who just want to shoot some muslims, either because of the sterio-type that all muslims are terrorists, or due to religious belief. Now, in many a review i have seen the terms ""Bucket of Lies""  ""No informational Value"" and ""Just a Bush-bashing Film with no sence of Truth"" I just want to say, This does have informational value, It ISNT complete lies, and there is some truth to what moore has said. Now, could this be a vendetta film? Perhaps..but if it is...its the best damn vendetta film i ever saw. The thing is...It is a very well made film, regarless of content. Somewhere in the middle of the film , we meet a very republican mother, whos very proud of her son whos over in Iraq. Then one day, he dies, and WHAM! her entire perspective changes, We see a group of solders in a tank, ready to bombard a city, and of all the songs they can play, the listen to "" Let the Mother F**kers burn"" We see what might have been, we see what could have been, and we see that as americans, we are only human.Now for the republican stand point:As many of you put it: This was a pure anti-bush film. Mike Moore seems to hate almost everything, and you can tell. This movie was Bush-Bash after Bush Bash after Bush-Bash, and didn't even give republicans the benifit of the doubt. We see what could be proof of a vendetta when bush turns down Moore, in a confrence telling him to ""Get a life"" He probably should, but you have to admit: He's made it pretty good so far. Along with what seems to be vastly embellished truth, also, Moore always seems to want to put in vastly greusome pictures to proove his point. Another thing, I don't think anyone should bring polotics to the emmys, no matter what you opinion is, but moore seemed to deem it absolutly fit, so here you go. As far as alot of the material goes in the movie, it seems moore expects to change everyone's beliefs, but to be liberal, shouldn't you have to let people believe what they want to? Isnt that, like a rule or something? who knows, but one thing is certain, this movie has caused quite the ruccus, be that a bad thing or a good thing.To end my review, I would like to call apon the Great Charlie Chaplin, to give us a word of advice, We ALL need.""The Great Dictator""We all want to help one another, human beings are like that.We all want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone and the earth is rich and can provide for everyone.The way of life can be free and beautiful.But we have lost the way.Greed has poisoned men's souls - has barricaded the world with hate; has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.We have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in: machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little: More than machinery we need humanity; More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me I say ""Do not despair"".The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress: the hate of men will pass and dictators die and the power they took from the people, will return to the people and so long as men die [now] liberty will never perish...Soldiers - don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you and enslave you - who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel, who drill you, diet you, treat you as cattle, as cannon fodder.Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men, with machine minds and machine hearts. You are not machines. You are not cattle. You are men. You have the love of humanity in your hearts. You don't hate - only the unloved hate. Only the unloved and the unnatural. Soldiers - don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty.In the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke it is written "" the kingdom of God is within man "" - not one man, nor a group of men - but in all men - in you, the people.You the people have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness. You the people have the power to make life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy let's use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give you the future and old age and security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power, but they lie. They do not fulfil their promise, they never will. Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. Now let us fight to fulfil that promise. Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.Soldiers - in the name of democracy, let us all unite!Look up! Look up! The clouds are lifting - the sun is breaking through. We are coming out of the darkness into the light. We are coming into a new world. A kind new world where men will rise above their hate and brutality.The soul of man has been given wings - and at last he is beginning to fly. He is flying into the rainbow - into the light of hope - into the future, that glorious future that belongs to you, to me and to all of us. Look up. Look up.""",5,Come on!

Case in point: Fahrenheit 9/11. This movie is chuck full of clips taken entirely out of context and purposely made to look George Bush stupid with ""dumb music"" playing in the background. There are clips that are supposed to show the President's ineffectiveness but they are utterly pointless. Let's take the scene where George Bush is at the elementary school and he's told the news about the Twin Towers by his secret service agent. The President continues to sit in the classroom listening to the child who's talking. I suppose that the purpose of this scene is to show how idiotic the President was by not reacting. Firstly, we don't know what the President was told exactly. No one knew at the time that the attack on the Twin Towers was a terrorist act. Secondly, what exactly did Moore expect the President to do? Panic and leave? Tell the child who's speaking to stop and run out? What he did instead was to do what we would expect a President to do during a time of crisis: he kept his cool and left the school without raising any alarms in front of little children. There is another clip where the President says that he's not concerned about Osama Bin-Laden. Again, this clip was taken out of context. The President has said repeatedly that he's not interested in individuals in the axis of terror but the entire network.Whether or not you're a George W. Bush fan, Michael Moore's work is here to appeal to our emotions and spin the facts.

629707,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B00005JNEI,A. Estes,"[8, 13]","I'm not going to claim to be the smartest person when it comes to politics, I'm not. I don't know (and neither do you, fellow reviewers) everything that is going on behind the scenes in America, so I can't really say that what is presented in Michael Moore's highly praised ""Farhenheit 9/11"" is %100 relevant. Afterall, as someone who considers himself to be 100 percent democrat, even I can see that this documentary is lop-sided. From the beginning, it is almost evident that Moore has a personal axe to grind with Dubbya, as displayed early on when the kind gentlemen that is our president, greets Moore with the sentiments ""Get a real job."" But then again, who doesn't have a problem with Bush these days? I have to say, on a personal level, what has happened to America over the past four years, and some of the values Bush stands for, downright piss me off. And the funny part about this movie is, none of the information was surprising to me. It shows Bush as the true moron he is at times, such as when he is doing an interview in a small-town where he says that the people ""don't know the meaning of hard-work"" or in the extra-features, after an interview with the 9/11 Commission, telling the reporters that he talked about ""stuff"" and ""things"" and ""topics."" Not the best P.R. guy, eh? His past is dug into quite a bit here, and not surprisingly, the connections with the Bin Laden family. Make no mistake, there is ample Bush-bashing here. If you're a supporter of the dude, it's gonna infuriate you. But I hardly think Moore is providing us with false information, afterall, his nasal-voiced narration is mainly done over stock footage and interviews, can't really make this stuff up folks (editing my ass). It doesn't have all the answers, or any at all, but let's not make outrageous statements like ""Anti-American"" or simply cutting Moore down by mentioning his weight, something which the average American seems to struggle with. Just watch the movie. Absorb what is presented to you, do more research, and then develop an opinion of your own. I don't take this work as gospel; I knew who I was voting for before this movie came out. Just like I don't need Ben Affleck and Bruce Springsteen to help me make up my mind, I didn't need this movie to do it either. This film and other propaganda, pro or anti-Bush, should be taken with a grain of salt. The people making these films have their own political agendas, and are usually only telling half the side, which is the case with ""Fahrenheit 9/11."" I didn't want Bush as my president, but I don't exactly see him as the embodiment of all evil, just the embodiment of all stupidity (sorry, couldn't help it). But the bottom line is: The film is well-made, and in typical Moore fashion, entertains and informs.

The blank, vague look on his face much of the time speaks volumes. Especially when on September 11 2001, after been told a second plane had struck the World Trade Centre, he sat for seven minutes in a Florida kindergarten, reading ""My Pet Goat."" This footage was only available because the kindergarten teacher had her own video camera running.Much of the film is about the murky connections between the Bush family, the bin Laden family (Osama bin Laden's father was one of the richest men in Saudi Arabia), and the Saudi royal family. Interspersed with his footage of the grim reality of war, even the Arab news channel Al Jazeera would have shied away from. You get to see the devastating effect of supposed smart weapons on Iraqi children in brutal detail.Although Moore himself didn't go to Iraq, there is also extensive coverage of the US troops there, operating in and around Baghdad. They are in turn scared, angry at been there, and pumped full of adrenaline at getting to play with very big, dangerous toys. One sequence shows a patrol ridiculing a hooded detainee, one man (unlike the prison guards at Abu Ghraib, he was smart enough to wear a balaclava) sexually humiliating the prisoner.One of the final powerful, though once again painful to watch, sequences was of grief stricken mother Lila Lipscomb, whose son Michael Pedersen had been killed in Iraq. His last letter home was full of anger at Bush, saying ""He got us here for nothing whatsoever."" In tears outside the Whitehouse a Bush supporter tells her she should be blaming Al Qaeda for the death of her son.Much of this information is not new, but just isn't presented clearly by the news media. Here it is packaged in a way, has clearly sparked heated debate amongst Americans. A filmmaker who wasn't Michael Moore probably could have handled the material more deftly, and with much less hatred, but Moore gets across his anger to you. You will leave the cinema feeling like having a long talk with John Howard about getting the troops back now.",3,Propoganda Misfired,1131667200,"11 11, 2005",2005,2461,"['Oscar-winner', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'agitation', 'propaganda', 'documentary', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'like', 'not', 'depending', 'support', 'John', 'Howard', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'Moore', 'agenda', 'room', 'complex', 'analysis', 'evidence', 'support', 'point', 'view', 'Instead', 'are', 'treated', '112-minute', 'long', 'blame', 'game.Moore', 'film', 'scathing', 'political', 'attack', 'presidency', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'blank', 'vague', 'look', 'face', 'much', 'time', 'volumes', 'Especially', 'when', 'September', '11', '2001', 'been', 'told', 'second', 'plane', 'had', 'struck', 'World', 'Trade', 'Centre', 'sat', 'seven', 'minutes', 'Florida', 'kindergarten', 'reading', 'Pet', 'Goat', 'footage', 'was', 'only', 'available', 'kindergarten', 'teacher', 'had', 'own', 'video', 'camera', 'running.Much', 'film', 'murky', 'connections', 'Bush', 'family', 'bin', 'Laden', 'family', 'Osama', 'Laden', 'father', 'was', 'one', 'richest', 'men', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'Saudi', 'royal', 'family', 'Interspersed', 'footage', 'grim', 'reality', 'war', 'even', 'Arab', 'news', 'channel', 'Al', 'Jazeera', 'would', 'have', 'shied', 'away', 'get', 'see', 'devastating', 'effect', 'supposed', 'smart', 'weapons', 'Iraqi', 'children', 'brutal', 'detail.Although', 'Moore', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'Iraq', 'also', 'extensive', 'coverage', 'US', 'troops', 'there', 'operating', 'Baghdad', 'are', 'turn', 'scared', 'angry', 'been', 'there', 'pumped', 'full', 'adrenaline', 'getting', 'play', 'very', 'big', 'dangerous', 'toys', 'One', 'sequence', 'patrol', 'ridiculing', 'hooded', 'detainee', 'one', 'man', 'prison', 'guards', 'Abu', 'Ghraib', 'was', 'smart', 'enough', 'wear', 'balaclava', 'sexually', 'humiliating', 'prisoner.One', 'final', 'powerful', 'though', 'once', 'again', 'painful', 'watch', 'sequences', 'was', 'grief', 'stricken', 'mother', 'Lila', 'Lipscomb', 'son', 'Michael', 'Pedersen', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'Iraq', 'last', 'letter', 'home', 'was', 'full', 'anger', 'Bush', 'saying', 'got', 'here', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'tears', 'Whitehouse', 'Bush', 'supporter', 'should', 'be', 'blaming', 'Al', 'Qaeda', 'death', 'son.Much', 'information', 'not', 'new', 'just', ""n't"", 'presented', 'clearly', 'news', 'media', 'Here', 'packaged', 'way', 'clearly', 'sparked', 'heated', 'debate', 'amongst', 'Americans', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'Michael', 'Moore', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'handled', 'material', 'more', 'deftly', 'much', 'less', 'hatred', 'Moore', 'anger', 'will', 'leave', 'cinema', 'feeling', 'having', 'long', 'talk', 'John', 'Howard', 'getting', 'troops', 'back', 'now']",Fahrenheit 9/11

629715,A3TLY1A7NGVCQM,B00005JNEI,"Alexander E. Paulsen ""AlexP""","[0, 25]","Except for The Passion of the Christ, this is the most important film of the year, and everyone who still harbors a modicum of respect for our present government should see it.That said, the movie had some problems. First, believe it or not, I think Michael Moore does not give Bush enough credit with respect to the first half of his presidency. More importantly, we should be careful in giving Michael Moore too much praise for anything, ever.Let's be honest: Bush did the right thing, sometimes.There are some things Bush has done for which we should praise him - things for which Moore seems to fault Bush, but which I'd like to see Bush do a lot more.For example, Moore faults Bush for spending a record amount of time in office on vacation on his ranch, during the first part of his term. How can that be a bad thing? Time spent on vacation is time not spent bombing the rest of the world, oppressing citizens at home, and growing government to a record size. I would go so far as to assert as an axiom that the more time a president spends playing, the better. (Warren Harding may be the model president in this and most other respects).Moore also wants us to be disturbed by the fact that Bush remained in a Florida classroom reading My Pet Goat for seven minutes after being told that America was ""under attack"" on September 11. Roger Ebert describes this as the ""most devastating"" thing in the whole film. But this piece of information has never disturbed me in the slightest. The only objectionable aspect is that he stayed there for only seven minutes. As with vacation, the more time he spends in an elementary school classroom with a blank look on his face, the less time he spends doing anything else. I'm happy about having seven more minutes of freedom than I otherwise might have had. I wish he were still down there.Moore also seems to fault the Transportation Security Administration for allowing you to take matches and lighters, but not your own breast milk, on board an airline flight. For this, he credits the influence of the tobacco companies, who want you to be able to smoke before and after you get on a plane. I don't know what basis he has for this assertion, but even if it's true, I'd say good for the tobacco companies. Now, allow cigarettes to be smoked on flights, as long as all of the passengers consent, and we might have something like freedom. Of course, Moore's main point is that the TSA is not about security at all, it's about the government befuddling and controlling Americans, with virtually no regard at all for genuine security risks.The movie could have bolstered its own credibility where it counts by eliminating some other extraneous criticisms. No matter how much I may dislike Bush, I will never get upset about him ""stealing"" the election. Every election is always stolen from anyone who did not cast a vote for the winner and therefore did not consent to whatever the winner might do to him. I'm not even upset about the Supreme Court deciding the election, because that means we're just nine voters away from abolishing democracy entirely.The worst thing about Fahrenheit 9/11.There are more serious reasons not to get too excited about Michael Moore.Keep in mind that this movie's success will give Moore more influence over the minds of the American people. When he wants to speak again, through another film, he will have the country's full attention.And when, perhaps thanks in part to this film, John Kerry is elected president, what will that film be about? A devastating critique of welfare statism? Of course not. In all likelihood, it will be something like an attack on the alleged evils of Wal-Mart. And given Moore's undeniable talent as a propagandist, to the mass-man who does not understand economics, that film will look every bit as credible and persuasive as Fahrenheit 9/11.Surely anyone would agree that it's ethically wrong to give someone money, when you know for certain that they are going to spend it on a weapon with which they will commit a murder. Is it any more conscionable to give Moore money and accolades when we know he's going to spend his enhanced credibility on advancing economic ignorance, and, if he is successful, increasing poverty and even death in countless unseen ways?Well, maybe. It is a great movie.Regardless, let's celebrate a movie that, as the noted political philosopher the Libertarian Jackass has observed, has the laudable goal of ""bring[ing] down a president."" Bringing down a president is fun, and we should revel in it, and do it more often.But at the same time, we must be circumspect. As good as this film may be, remember that Michael Moore is a man who doesn't want you to be free to buy the products you want, to hire whomever you want, or even to defend your own person, property, and family.When the tables inevitably turn on the neocon regime, he will once again be our worst enemy. We would be wise to continuously acknowledge that, and never fail to remind everyone of why he is so wrong about everything else.",5,Heres a great review.I didn't write it but it should be

Michael Moore could be narrating ""On September 10th, George Bush took a sip of water"" (audience reaction) oh f**k""That is the feeling I got throughout this film as Moore narrated.  While I enjoy his films and the persona he shows in them, he may never make a film as bad as this one. He seems to be conspicuously absent on the screen for much of the time and that makes his narration feel intrusive, as if he's trying to distance himself from the material in any small way he can so he doesn't seem too mean spirited and instead give off an aura of truthfulness.  While some of the things he says in this film are eye opening to the casual observer a number of the conclusions that Moore comes to are rash and speculative (which I don't mind, since he does this all the time) which makes most of his films entertaining, if not insightful, but this film is missing a true humor about itself because it was intended for a specific political purpose (with effects expected) in mind. To me, art never works that way since people often see the art much later than the intended effects, such is the case with me. Apart from the controversy, this film just doesn't entertain, or inform us. Moore wants to call Bush a criminal, but never does (for libel reasons, no doubt) so he just implies it. That's the problem with this documentary, it seems to pull the most obvious of punches when that's the reason for its existence, to knock out the opposition.

Moore does a great job of having backed every single thing he says up with solid evidence. You cannot deny evidence. And all of the scenes it shows of Bush? Like one reviewer said, Moore didn't hire some guy to dress up as President Bush and act retarded. Moore didn't hire actors to play army recruiters and politicians. Everything in his film is 100% authentic. And how can he show the other side of the story? There is no logic argument against the facts that Moore portrays. Do people think he is making this stuff up? Again, everything said is backed by evidance. How could people not be sad by watching a woman make a trip to Washington DC after her son was killed in an unnecessary war, and then having the door slammed in her face? That should even make a conservative sad- and if it doesn't, than you are completely heartless and have absolutely no sympathy.

629718,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00005JNEI,Alex Udvary,"[7, 12]","I cannot think of another movie in modern times where your enjoyment depended so strongly on your political views. There was a movie made a while ago which starred Joan Allen called ""The Contender"" that Republicans bashed as being too liberal, but they didn't seem to take that film on as personally as they are this film, ""Fahrenheit 9\11"". And it really is this simple. If you are a Democrat there's a 90% chance you'll enjoy this film. If you are a Republican there's a 90% chance you'll hate this movie. I say 90% because nothing in life is 100% except as the old joke goes death and taxes.Most people should know by now what this film is about. We have all heard the controversy surrounding it for quite some time now. But not until Wednesday were audiences allowed to see the Golden Palm winner at the Cannes Film Festival.Michael Moore takes a look at the Bush Administration and accusses the Bush family of having ""ties"", and we've seen how confusing that word can be lately, with the bin Laden family and makes a point of saying there is much going on behind the American people's back concerning the war in Iraq, members of the Bush cabinet, and other issues such as homeland security.I admit I have been dying to see this movie. I couldn't wait. I'm a fan of Michael Moore and his politics, I feel it's important, at least when talking about a movie like this to be upfront as to what your political views are. Because some views will prevent many from having an open mind and enjoying this film. I am a liberal Democrat, and I'm 110% against the right-wing.I was extremely interested through-out the entire lenght of the film and was completely surprised to learn what I did. Some things the American public already know such as Dick Cheney's involvment with Halliburton, the prison-abuse scandal, and according to Richard Clarke, President Bush's preoccupation with Iraq before and after 9\11.Many member of the right-wing have already came out and advised people not to see this film. That say it is nothing but lies. But, if you see the movie, and this is what I like best about it, Moore never actually makes the claims. He uses the New York times, the L.A. times, interviews from Good Morning America, the Today Show, the 9\11 investigation hearings, and Larry King to support his claimes. He shows clips of these interviews where OTHER people make these accusations NOT Moore. I firmly believe 100% what I was shown. And don't kid yourselves, Moore is not the first to say these things.But, political ideas aside is ""Fahrenheit 9\11"" worth seeing? Yes. It is well-made, very, very funny and displays Moore's conviction to the subject. Some may say he makes it too personal, but because of that he can see Moore gets his facts straight. He devoted a lot of time to this exactly because it was personal, and he wanted to present the best case he could against Bush.Every American should see this film. Consider it the political ""Passion of the Christ"". Take the whole family to see this, we, the American people, need to know what's going on. Anyone who plans to vote this year I pled with you, go see this film. Not that it matters, because I think of this as more than just a movie, but, it's one of the best films I've seen all year. It stirred me up and is a great conversation piece to discuss with people.I haven't given much away because that wouldn't be fair. You need to see this and just be prepared to be shocked at what's going on behind our backs. This is a MASTERPIECE and I plan on seeing it again.Something else that needs to be pointed out is people will assume MY political beliefs cause me to be bias towards the film. Let me explain something. One of the things I feel makes a movie great is when it gives you something to think about. When it's thought provoking. Whether you like or hate this film, it's NOT one of those movies where after you leave you'll forget about it 5 minutes later. It has a strong lasting power. It makes you think and raises I feel very important questions that deserve answers. Also as I already stated, the movie is a conversation piece, it may cause a debate. This is what makes a movie great. How many films cause such intense feelings after seeing them? How many movies stay with us long after we have seen them? And how many will cause a debate? Not many. And the ones that do we often consider great movies. That is half of the reason why I recommend people see this film and why I call it a masterpiece.Bottom-line: As far as I'm concerned, an honest look at the Bush Administration showing us things many of us never would have dreamed possible. Liberals rejoice and vote Kerry in '04!

629719,AFXTPJOE2D4M3,B00005JNEI,Algernon D'Ammassa,"[4, 14]","As someone who happens to agree with much of Michael Moore's politics, I very much enjoyed Moore's humor throughout his latest, whether it's him reading the text of the Patriot Act through a loudspeaker outside Congress, or trying to persuade Congressmen to sign up their own sons for military service in Iraq; or simply enjoying the footage he has found of Paul Wolfowitz spitting on his comb, or Bush struggling to say, ""Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.""As an honest movie viewer, however, I have to remark that this isn't a documentary so much as a two-hour anti-Bush infomercial.  There are no no revelations of fact, and the facts - despite NEWSWEEK's inaccurate criticisms in advance of the film's release - do check out.  What is more controversial are Moore's conclusions, as the film deliberately targets Republicans and the Bush Administration in particular.  Moore's ambition for this movie is to shock and outrage voters into voting Bush out of office, and the film has that feel: more recruitment than journalism.There are cheap shots.  The footage of President Bush looking stunned and glancing around a classroom when he has just been told of the 9/11 attacks is spun as negatively as possible.  The image is slowed down and while Bush stares into space, Moore is there in voice-over to tell us that Bush is reeling because he has no script and no handlers to tell him what to do.  Maaaaaybe, but in fairness, putting myself in that position, I might have a similar expression on my face simply for shock and grief.Moore is not only a great entertainer and a smart, smart commentator - his art as a propagandist is skillful, juxtaposing images to create an alternative narrative for the last four years.  Wisely, however, Moore can also step back and let the mother of a killed American soldier speak for herself as she grapples with the meaning of the Iraq occupation.Will the movie topple the Bush Administration?  Time will tell.  If not, it may accomplish something else almost as important to this viewer: reclaiming patriotism from the hawks.  Patriotism CAN look like George W.

It did the unthinkable it showed information on the president that i thought myself would have completely exploited him at all costs. But i admire Micheal Moore for not just dilivering a greatly entertaining film but also showing us what we need to see and here. There are many people, who are against Micheal Moore and in some ways i have been and still am. But the irony is that people will make up there minds of this film before they even seeing it. I know because i did the same. But after seeing the film i know that Micheal Moore has made a movie that is not entirely untrue, though he takes some trueths and twists them in key areas so that they stay true in fact, but the people and media get the wrong idea. But the accually  gist of it is that about 90% of this film is accually facts and untwisted facts. The movie dos have some problems though sometimes the music will overshadow the over all sounds and fell of the events takeing place at the time in the movie and though you really want to pay attention to the film. You cant because this problem becomes too anoiying. Though i only found this to be a problem for about the first 20 minutes of the film.The movie is also verry violent in some seens and shows some verry raw and gritty images of the fight in ireaq, after seeing these seens of creul and violent nature (which also adds in some at times unnessessary language) there really is no reason to heed the film R rating like some of the media is trying to do.

I am a Michael Moore fan so went into this movie expecting it to be good. It was that and more. Anyone seeing this movie will come away with, at the least, a few questions that need answering. I have heard many people saying that this is a horrible movie. The majority of them have not seen it. Do yourself a favor and go see it before you talk about it. It you still think it's bad, well that's an informed opinion and one I can respect. The thing which impressed me about Fahrenheit 9/11 is that Michael Moore is very clear that while he does not in any way support the Bush presidency or the administration war machine, he also has tremendous respect for the young men and women who have chosen the military as a way of serving our country. I have rarely seen this expressed so effectively. As an african-american woman, the most heart breaking moments for me were the senate hearing regarding the election of GWB when the voices of many african americans were heard protesting the election results and each time Al Gore asked if they had the signature of one U.S. Senator.  Not a single senator out of 100 could be found to support the resolutions. Why did we not know that these hearings were happening? Where was the U.S. Senate when people were clearly asking for help?

Bush's thoughts as Bush is informed of a plane crashing into the World Trade Center. Moore suggests that Bush was thinking only of Saudi oil investments. None of us knew what was going in those early minutes of the terror strike on the Trade Center, as the unthinkable took place. Anyone who has taken an introductory course in Logic learns of the fallacies of making logical assumptions based on innuendo. I was just revolted by Moore's completely immoral, hate-filled screed of a 'film'. Moore also insulted the intelligence of the American people by assuming that they would believe his innuendo-filled comments. And this is where he went wrong: the American people were/are not as stupid as Moore believes them to be, and many people were insulted by Moore's arrogant attitude and assumptions, as he spoke down to them as if they could not think for themselves. And in their disgust at Moore's condescension, and ad hominem portrayal of a man who, whether you liked his policies or not, just happened to have the job of president of the United States at the time of the horrific terror attack, many viewers of this movie quite likely voted FOR George W. Bush, not against him. I truly believe that this shoddy film actually caused more people to vote FOR George W. Bush in November 2004, than against him. Moore's arrogance and carelessness boomeranged on him. If Moore had not made this movie, perhaps G. W. Bush would not have been reelected.I had somewhat enjoyed Moore's simplistic earlier effort, 'Bowling For Columbine', and was expecting much better than this trashy attempt at money-making through slander-based controversy. I should have known better; Moore is an entertainer, and not an insightful political analyst by any stretch of the imagination. Thank God that many Americans (including left-leaning ones like me) have something called education and/or common sense and can recognize lies and deception like the kind Moore attempts to foist off on the public.An interesting related read is 'The Trouble with Islam. A Wake-Up Call For Honesty and Change' by Canadian Muslim lesbian author Irshad Manji, who also dismisses Michael Moore.That Moore's trash won the 'prestigious' Palme D'Or film award in France is only because of the ever-present and fashionable anti-Americanism prevalent in French 'intellectual' circles, and yet another symptom of the cultural malaise that France has experienced in recent years, and about which much has been written.Note also political commentator Andrew Sullivan's creation of the 'Moore Award', for ""divisive, bitter, and intemperate left-wing rhetoric"".",1,the film that got George W.

Other documentary makers could do worse than emulate Moore's style.  However, there are undoubtedly occasions when he oversteps the mark.  For example, he gives the impression that America's Oregon coast is guarded by one state trooper.  This is clearly absurd but an impression is, nonetheless, passed off as fact.  Moore should take care with all his facts.It is now widely understood that there is no real connection between Al Qaeda and Saddam's regime in Iraq.  George Bush and his supporters will, in due course, face the wrath of the electorate.  Moore simply points out facts that some choose to ignore.

629731,A1D6DFC3AGV3JZ,B00005JNEI,Andrew Parodi,"[11, 13]","Though I usually agree with Michael Moore's views, occasionally I am a bit put off by his approach. His books and documentaries concern very heavy, important topics such as corporate crime, racism, teenage violence, and murder. I think that his mix of humor with such profound topics can occasionally be out-of-place. For example, I am not terribly comfortable with the poster for Fahrenheit 9/11 depicting Mr. Moore grinning as though he's done something naughty but cute, or the image of him hand-in-hand with George W. Bush. It seems to kind of trivialize a very serious situation that has cost the lives of thousands of people. So, though I know that Michael Moore, like myself, is opposed to the Iraq war, I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 with a bit of hesitancy. This war is no laughing matter.Much to my surprise, Fahrenheit 9/11 is tasteful in just about every respect. Mr. Moore does occasionally go for the laugh, such as when asking members of congress to enlist their children in the military, or when recounting Mr. Bush's famous Bushisms, e.g., ""The question has to be asked: Is our children learning?"" But when it comes to depiction of the profound tragedies of this war, the civilian deaths and injuries in Iraq, the loss of US military, the traumatic injuries sustained by some troops (including graphic images of limbless young soldiers), the impact on the families of the military, the shredding of civil liberties via the Patriot Act, or the fear instilled in the US population by the Bush administration's constant and ridiculous ""terror alters,"" no attempt at humor is found. In fact, such scenes are largely devoid of Michael Moore's voice. No narration is needed.Lila Lipscomb is, in my opinion, the heart of the documentary. She is a mother and career guidance counselor in Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan. Several of her children have served in the military, and one of her sons was deployed to Iraq. As Moore points out, recruitment is common in Flint and all poverty-stricken areas. Those at the bottom of the economic system are usually the same people sent to protect it. And Mrs. Lipscomb, a proud American who displays her flag every morning, never letting it touch the ground, is a great champion of the military. She encourages young men and women to enlist and serve their country. It's a great way to get out of poverty, to see the world, to help out.When asked for her views on anti-war protestors, Mrs. Lipscomb says it felt like a slap in the face.It was an important epiphany for her to realize that the protestors were not vilifying the troops or hoping for their defeat, but were opposed to the basis of the war. The troops, of course, had nothing to do with establishing that basis. This was a very important piece of the movie for me because I have often been the polar opposite of Mrs. Lipscomb. Over the last year when I have heard people say they support the war, what I translated that to mean is, ""I believe innocent Iraqi children should be murdered."" Mrs. Lipscomb's testimonials helped me understand that the war does not mean that to those who support it. She, as well as all other military families, are justifiably concerned for the safety of their loved ones, and it is inconceivable to such people that the US government would be reckless with the lives of their loved ones. For them, supporting the troops means not bringing into question the validity of the reasons we've been given for the invasion. Sadly, devastatingly (the second time I sobbed during the documentary, my head buried in my hands), by the end of the documentary Mrs. Lipscomb has changed her mind.I am deeply thankful to Michael Moore for having the courage to bring to the mainstream forum what the corporate media has had the power to shut out for so long. If the horrors of war were always so honestly depicted in the mainstream media then we would not rush into war so easily. And while Fahrenheit 9/11 will inevitably be labeled as biased and one-sided, facts are not partisan. It is a fact that thousands died on Sept. 11th, 2001. It is a fact that the Bush administration has not yet caught Osama bin Laden. It is a fact that an estimated 10,000 Iraqi civilians were killed during the US bombardment of Iraq. It is a fact that over 800 US soldiers have died and several thousands have been permanently injured. It is a fact that Mrs. Lipscomb's son was killed in Iraq. And it is a fact that I may lose my own nephew. He recently enlisted. Time in Iraq is not inconceivable, as his cousin only recently returned from Iraq.",5,Michael Moore's respectful investigation of the Iraq War,1093564800,"08 27, 2004",2004,4549,"['usually', 'agree', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'views', 'occasionally', 'am', 'bit', 'put', 'off', 'approach', 'books', 'documentaries', 'concern', 'very', 'heavy', 'important', 'topics', 'such', 'corporate', 'crime', 'racism', 'teenage', 'violence', 'murder', 'think', 'mix', 'humor', 'such', 'topics', 'can', 'occasionally', 'be', 'out-of-place', 'example', 'am', 'not', 'terribly', 'comfortable', 'poster', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'depicting', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'grinning', 'done', 'something', 'naughty', 'cute', 'image', 'hand-in-hand', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'kind', 'trivialize', 'very', 'serious', 'situation', 'cost', 'lives', 'thousands', 'people', 'So', 'know', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'opposed', 'Iraq', 'war', 'saw', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'bit', 'hesitancy', 'war', 'laughing', 'matter.Much', 'surprise', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'tasteful', 'just', 'respect', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'occasionally', 'go', 'laugh', 'such', 'when', 'asking', 'members', 'congress', 'enlist', 'children', 'military', 'when', 'recounting', 'Mr.', 'Bush', 'famous', 'Bushisms', 'e.g.', 'question', 'be', 'asked', 'children', 'learning', 'when', 'depiction', 'profound', 'tragedies', 'war', 'civilian', 'deaths', 'injuries', 'Iraq', 'loss', 'US', 'military', 'traumatic', 'injuries', 'sustained', 'troops', 'including', 'graphic', 'images', 'limbless', 'young', 'soldiers', 'impact', 'families', 'military', 'shredding', 'civil', 'liberties', 'Patriot', 'Act', 'fear', 'instilled', 'US', 'population', 'Bush', 'administration', 'constant', 'ridiculous', 'terror', 'alters', 'attempt', 'humor', 'found', 'fact', 'such', 'scenes', 'are', 'largely', 'devoid', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'voice', 'narration', 'needed.Lila', 'Lipscomb', 'opinion', 'heart', 'documentary', 'mother', 'career', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'Moore', 'hometown', 'Flint', 'Michigan', 'Several', 'children', 'have', 'served', 'military', 'one', 'sons', 'was', 'deployed', 'Iraq', 'Moore', 'points', 'out', 'recruitment', 'common', 'Flint', 'poverty-stricken', 'areas', 'bottom', 'economic', 'system', 'are', 'usually', 'same', 'people', 'sent', 'protect', 'Mrs.', 'Lipscomb', 'proud', 'American', 'who', 'flag', 'morning', 'never', 'letting', 'ground', 'great', 'champion', 'military', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'enlist', 'serve', 'country', 'great', 'way', 'get', 'poverty', 'see', 'world', 'help', 'out.When', 'asked', 'views', 'anti-war', 'protestors', 'Mrs.', 'Lipscomb', 'felt', 'slap', 'face.It', 'was', 'important', 'epiphany', 'realize', 'protestors', 'were', 'not', 'vilifying', 'troops', 'hoping', 'defeat', 'were', 'opposed', 'basis', 'war', 'troops', 'course', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'establishing', 'basis', 'was', 'very', 'important', 'piece', 'movie', 'have', 'often', 'been', 'polar', 'opposite', 'Mrs.', 'Lipscomb', 'last', 'year', 'when', 'have', 'heard', 'people', 'say', 'support', 'war', 'what', 'translated', 'mean', 'believe', 'innocent', 'Iraqi', 'children', 'should', 'be', 'murdered', 'Mrs.', 'Lipscomb', 'testimonials', 'helped', 'understand', 'war', 'not', 'mean', 'who', 'support', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'military', 'families', 'are', 'justifiably', 'concerned', 'safety', 'loved', 'ones', 'inconceivable', 'such', 'people', 'US', 'government', 'would', 'be', 'reckless', 'lives', 'loved', 'ones', 'supporting', 'troops', 'not', 'bringing', 'question', 'validity', 'reasons', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', 'invasion', 'Sadly', 'devastatingly', 'second', 'time', 'sobbed', 'documentary', 'head', 'buried', 'hands', 'end', 'documentary', 'Mrs.', 'Lipscomb', 'changed', 'mind.I', 'am', 'deeply', 'thankful', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'having', 'courage', 'bring', 'mainstream', 'forum', 'what', 'corporate', 'media', 'had', 'power', 'shut', 'out', 'so', 'long', 'horrors', 'war', 'were', 'always', 'so', 'honestly', 'depicted', 'mainstream', 'media', 'then', 'would', 'not', 'rush', 'war', 'so', 'easily', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'will', 'inevitably', 'be', 'labeled', 'biased', 'one-sided', 'facts', 'are', 'not', 'partisan', 'fact', 'thousands', 'died', 'Sept.', '11th', '2001', 'fact', 'Bush', 'administration', 'not', 'yet', 'caught', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Laden', 'fact', 'estimated', '10,000', 'Iraqi', 'civilians', 'were', 'killed', 'US', 'bombardment', 'Iraq', 'fact', '800', 'US', 'soldiers', 'have', 'died', 'several', 'thousands', 'have', 'been', 'permanently', 'injured', 'fact', 'Mrs.', 'Lipscomb', 'son', 'was', 'killed', 'Iraq', 'fact', 'may', 'lose', 'own', 'nephew', 'recently', 'enlisted', 'Time', 'Iraq', 'not', 'inconceivable', 'cousin', 'only', 'recently', 'returned', 'Iraq']",Fahrenheit 9/11

I can almost see why other countries don't allow bashing of their leaders.  this was the most ridiculous, one-sided load of garbage I had ever seen in my life. if he doesn't like bush that much, he can get out of the country.  Bush is human and honest and did what he could under the circumstances. If he thinks he could've done better, he can run for president, instead of mocking others.  he makes me sick.In response to the famous scene of bush reading to little kids after hearing that the first plane attacked, keep in mind, that at the time, we didn't know what the first plane was.  at first, the news thought it could've been an accident, and was only later thought to be possibly, and possibly paranoid to think it, a terrorist attack.  my first thought was that in speculation that the first plane, (assuming all his opinionated facts are straight), could've been a drunk pilot, the second plane was the confirmation of attack, when bush was already in the classroom.  What could've been done about that?  Shoot down all the planes in the sky?  Which ones are full of terrorists? and there are innocent citizens onboard.Moore admits to having a grudge against Bush as well. So this is really just him getting payback for Bush telling him to get a real job?  Probably.Whether Moore's facts really are true or false or manipulated to fit his own opinion, the point is that Bush did all he could afterwards and was even mocked for htat.  now, we're as naive as we were before the attack.  we're like, gawd, chill out bush, youre so paranoid. its not like it'll ever happen again or anything.  if we're like that now, even after such an unexpected attack, then imagine how carefree we were before it.  no wonder we didn't know what to do. Bush is trying hard to protect the country, to keep the same mistakes from happening again, and people make fun of him for it.Moore needs to think, rather than judge.  when he's president and does a better job, i'll bite my tongue.  till then, he's a golddigger, and if this movie really is just his message to the world, and if he's so high and mighty as to assume he can make a movie about other people's faults and mistakes, then he should donate every penny he earned to charity instead of being such a hypocrite.",1,pathetic,1142812800,"03 20, 2006",2006,2546,"['used', 'guy', 'made', 'movie', 'saw', 'movie', 'sigh', 'well', 'i', 'hope', 'made', 'lot', 'money', 'suffering', 'others', 'lucky', 'free', 'country', 'so', 'free', 'was', 'allowed', 'make', 'movie', 'show', 'theaters', 'sell', 'dvd', 'can', 'almost', 'see', 'why', 'other', 'countries', 'do', ""n't"", 'allow', 'bashing', 'leaders', 'was', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'one-sided', 'load', 'garbage', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'life', ""n't"", 'like', 'bush', 'much', 'can', 'get', 'country', 'Bush', 'human', 'honest', 'did', 'what', 'could', 'circumstances', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'better', 'can', 'run', 'president', 'instead', 'mocking', 'others', 'sick.In', 'response', 'famous', 'scene', 'bush', 'reading', 'little', 'kids', 'hearing', 'first', 'plane', 'attacked', 'keep', 'mind', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'first', 'plane', 'was', 'first', 'news', 'thought', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'accident', 'was', 'only', 'later', 'thought', 'be', 'possibly', 'possibly', 'paranoid', 'think', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'speculation', 'first', 'plane', 'assuming', 'opinionated', 'facts', 'are', 'straight', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'drunk', 'pilot', 'second', 'plane', 'was', 'confirmation', 'attack', 'when', 'bush', 'was', 'already', 'classroom', 'What', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done', 'Shoot', 'planes', 'sky', 'Which', 'ones', 'are', 'full', 'terrorists', 'are', 'innocent', 'citizens', 'onboard.Moore', 'admits', 'having', 'grudge', 'Bush', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'just', 'getting', 'payback', 'Bush', 'telling', 'get', 'real', 'job', 'Probably.Whether', 'Moore', 'facts', 'really', 'are', 'true', 'false', 'manipulated', 'fit', 'own', 'opinion', 'point', 'Bush', 'did', 'could', 'afterwards', 'was', 'even', 'mocked', 'htat', 'now', ""'re"", 'as', 'naive', 'were', 'attack', ""'re"", 'gawd', 'chill', 'out', 'bush', 'youre', 'so', 'paranoid', 'not', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'happen', 'again', 'anything', ""'re"", 'now', 'even', 'such', 'unexpected', 'attack', 'then', 'imagine', 'how', 'carefree', 'were', 'wonder', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'Bush', 'trying', 'hard', 'protect', 'country', 'keep', 'same', 'mistakes', 'happening', 'again', 'people', 'make', 'fun', 'it.Moore', 'needs', 'think', 'rather', 'judge', 'when', 'president', 'better', 'job', 'i', ""'ll"", 'bite', 'tongue', 'till', 'then', 'golddigger', 'movie', 'really', 'just', 'message', 'world', 'so', 'high', 'mighty', 'assume', 'can', 'make', 'movie', 'other', 'people', 'faults', 'mistakes', 'then', 'should', 'donate', 'penny', 'earned', 'charity', 'instead', 'being', 'such', 'hypocrite']",Fahrenheit 9/11

Come on, people; can't we SEE the movie first and THEN review it?Anyway, Fahrenheit 9/11 is a very interesting movie. Michael Moore's dismay against President Bush is still evident here, and basically he talks about the events leading up to, and resulting from, Bush's inauguration and the World Trade Center attacks, as well as the unnecessary war with Iraq. And whether or not you agree with Michael's statements is relative, but at least he backs up his claims. Throughout the movie you'll find video clips and files of goings-on; also, you'll see what Bush was doing during these tough times and what he SHOULD'VE been doing (at least, according to Michael).I knocked off half a star because in the last half-hour of the movie, things started to drag.

I was very surprised by the emotional force of the movie.  I read and heard professional and non-professional reviews and comments before seeing this movie.  I expected to see things that were dramatic, but with questionable interpretations.  I'm still waiting.Michael Moore does provide his commentary on the events and issues of Iraq and terrorism, but he presented facts, not fiction.  Fact:  Bush sat in the kindergarten chair for several minutes after being told that the country was under attack and did NOTHING.  Fact:  the Bin Laden family was whisked away with U.S. approval without proper questioning, while middle age citizens and groups are being infiltrated by government spies, or they are questioned by the FBI.  Fact:  the Patriot Act was rushed through Congress without it being read.  These and many more scenes are facts.  The administration gives alternative explanations for why all these things occurred, but they can't refute the facts.  By the way, why did it take this movie to give us the truth about Bush's sitting in the classroom for so long, then later have his people talk about how immediately he went into action?  Any of those kindergartners could have told him to get up and move.To me, the most powerful scenes involve the pro-war lady from Michigan, who then loses her oldest son in Iraq.  Her pro-war comments were presented without interference from Moore, who interviewed her.  The camera then shows her reaction after she learned of her son's death and as she reads his last letter that his hostile to the war.  More disturbing is the scene of this poor lady as a woman in Washington tells her that her account of her son's death is fiction.  Only the coldest hearted of ""compassionate"" Republicans could fail to be moved by that scene and many others.  I too have a son in the military.

Believe it or not folks, but a documentary does not just show reality, it also interprets it. The point of a documentary is for those who see it to start making their own judgments. If you don't agree with Michael Moore's interpretation of the why's of the Iraq war, what is the right interpretation? Can you use the facts or find more facts to come up with a different interpretation? I would call that highly unlikely, but I would like to see the interpretation. This documentary set out to answer the question ""Why is the US in Iraq?"" I can tell you I have asked that question a lot and I found no good reason. Michael Moore has done the same thing, just to a larger audience. While you might disagree with his assessment that it was strictly for money, it is hard to support a different view after seeing this movie. You would be hard pressed to find any evidence linking Iraq and Al-Qaeda. Why? Because it doesn't exist. No matter how much Bush railed for a link, even he had to admit it wasn't there.How can you refute the 7 minutes of inactivity of Mr. Bush in the Florida classroom on 9/11? How can you refute the fact that planes were loaded up with Bin Laden relatives on 9/13? How can you call the ""coalition of the willing"" a coalition if it includes countries that send no troops?

Wayne Thompson IV,"[0, 1]","First let me just get it out there that I'm a liberal, I agree with the message of the film, and I oppose most of what the Bush administration has done in response to 9/11.I don't think I can honestly assess Moore's political message because of what I wrote above, so I won't try.  I didn't really need to be convinced.  It would certainly be my hope that an unbiased or right-leaning person who comes across this film would be swayed by what Moore presents, but I can't speak to the probability of that due to my bias.That said, I don't think there's any doubting Moore's skills as a documentarian and as a filmmaker.  I think even honest critics of his political views would have to concede that he knows how to make a movie.  Fahrenheit 9/11 is quite good, regardless of your politics, I think.  It's clever, is fast paced when it needs to be and slows down to dwell on the weightier items, and it does what documentarys should do (IMO): it shows us the truth right in front of us that we'd previously been blind to.I think this film is good enough to merit at least 1 viewing from people all over the political spectrum.

It is quite provocative but uses enough real footage and undeniable facts that you can't help feeling he has some very important points to make here.The movie opens on what George W. Bush was doing when he heard about the attacks on the World Trade Center. When the first plane hit, he was en route to a school where he had a photo op planned with some first grade children. So he goes right ahead and continues to the school. So he's sitting there reading some idiot story with the children (on film, after all, because it was indeed a photo op) when an aid comes and whispers in his ear about the second plane hitting he second tower. For 7 minutes or more, he continues to sit there with the children, very possibly in shock (hard to tell on that face), and does nothing. Of course, the teacher and the children have no idea what his aid just whispered in his ear, and they go blithely on with the story book.One point which cannot be missed in this movie is the extent to which GWB, President of the United States, is essentially clueless. We've known it for some time, of course; but this will rub your nose in it. The movie was made before Obama was elected, so take that into account in judging its effectiveness.Moore does not go so far as to say that Bush planned or even ordered the attacks on the Twin Towers, as some people have argued. But he does point out that the Bush clan (father and son) have many strong ties with oil men in the middle east, especially the Royal Saudis, and very specifically the Bin Laden family. I won't try to unpack the complex interrelationships of families and family money, oil money and oil reserves, financial and political power. Moore does it so well.The other thing he does so well is to go where the people are, ask them what's going on, and listening to what they have to say. He visits corporate money men who are getting rich off the war, or off the fear generated by 9/11/01. He visits whatever politicians and law enforcement people are willing to talk to him, and some that are not. But he also visits Iraq and the soldiers and civilians there. And, because he always needs to pander to the young people's love of blood and gore, shows some very graphic pictures of bloody corpses and other nasty details about the war.He makes friends with a family from his home town of Flint that lost a son in Iraq, and the soldier's mother later comes to Washington, D.C., and visits the White House. Moore brings along a disillusioned Marine to confront congressmen with the fact that there is exactly one son or daughter of a congressman with the military in Iraq. He offers them recruitment pamphlets go give to their children. Most are unwilling to accept them.Be sure you have a fresh box of tissues handy when you play this DVD; like all the others Moore has made, this one will grab at your heart.",4,Michael Moore Gets It Right,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,2889,"['Very', 'possibly', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'best', 'film', 'quite', 'provocative', 'enough', 'real', 'footage', 'undeniable', 'facts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'very', 'important', 'points', 'make', 'here.The', 'movie', 'what', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'was', 'doing', 'when', 'heard', 'attacks', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'When', 'first', 'plane', 'hit', 'was', 'en', 'route', 'school', 'where', 'had', 'photo', 'op', 'planned', 'first', 'grade', 'children', 'right', 'ahead', 'school', 'sitting', 'there', 'reading', 'idiot', 'story', 'children', 'film', 'was', 'indeed', 'photo', 'op', 'when', 'aid', 'whispers', 'ear', 'second', 'plane', 'hitting', 'second', 'tower', '7', 'minutes', 'more', 'sit', 'children', 'very', 'possibly', 'shock', 'hard', 'tell', 'face', 'nothing', 'course', 'teacher', 'children', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'aid', 'just', 'whispered', 'ear', 'go', 'blithely', 'story', 'book.One', 'point', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'movie', 'extent', 'GWB', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'essentially', 'clueless', ""'ve"", 'known', 'time', 'course', 'will', 'rub', 'nose', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Obama', 'was', 'elected', 'so', 'take', 'account', 'judging', 'effectiveness.Moore', 'not', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'Bush', 'planned', 'even', 'ordered', 'attacks', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'people', 'have', 'argued', 'point', 'out', 'Bush', 'clan', 'father', 'son', 'have', 'many', 'strong', 'ties', 'oil', 'men', 'middle', 'east', 'especially', 'Royal', 'Saudis', 'very', 'specifically', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'family', 'wo', ""n't"", 'try', 'unpack', 'complex', 'interrelationships', 'families', 'family', 'money', 'oil', 'money', 'oil', 'reserves', 'financial', 'political', 'power', 'Moore', 'so', 'other', 'thing', 'so', 'well', 'go', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'ask', 'what', 'going', 'listening', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'corporate', 'money', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'getting', 'rich', 'war', 'fear', 'generated', '9/11/01', 'politicians', 'law', 'enforcement', 'people', 'are', 'willing', 'talk', 'are', 'not', 'also', 'Iraq', 'soldiers', 'civilians', 'there', 'always', 'pander', 'young', 'people', 'love', 'blood', 'gore', 'very', 'graphic', 'pictures', 'bloody', 'corpses', 'other', 'nasty', 'details', 'war.He', 'friends', 'family', 'home', 'town', 'Flint', 'lost', 'son', 'Iraq', 'soldier', 'mother', 'later', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'White', 'House', 'Moore', 'disillusioned', 'Marine', 'confront', 'congressmen', 'fact', 'exactly', 'one', 'son', 'daughter', 'congressman', 'military', 'Iraq', 'recruitment', 'pamphlets', 'go', 'give', 'children', 'Most', 'are', 'unwilling', 'accept', 'them.Be', 'sure', 'have', 'fresh', 'box', 'tissues', 'handy', 'when', 'play', 'DVD', 'others', 'Moore', 'made', 'one', 'will', 'grab', 'heart']",Fahrenheit 9/11
629752,ALR35EFI69S5R,B00005JNEI,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[63, 75]","This film is a brilliantly-contrived and choreographed emotional roller coaster ride that incites a quite palpable resulting attitude of disgust, dismay, and disdain on the of the viewer. Mr. Moore manipulates the images, voice-overs and antics to both amuse and outrage us all at once, in an obviously outrageously satirical (and sometimes hysterical) look at the war in Iraq and the people who engineered us into invading that country, at terrible cost to ordinary American men and women.In essence that is the simple message of this pseudo-documentary; that simple, trusting and basically honorable young and patriotic Americans are being badly abused and misled  by an administration and a government out of control, a government which, in Mr. Moore's view of the world, serves its people up to slaughter without worry and care. After all, it is not, as he so comically and memorably demonstrates, the sons and daughters of the governing elite who serve and die in God-forsaken places like Iraq and Afghanistan.Thus, in one chaotic series of vignettes, Moore corners unsuspecting Congressmen and makes a pitch to have them volunteer their kids as potential cannon-fodder for Iraq. Needless to say, the point is well taken, as only one current member of Congress has a son stationed in harm's way in Iraq. He counter-poses such banal images with those of battle casualties and struggling working class mothers crying over their lost sons after the fact. One must hasten to acknowledge that in fact, Michael Moore makes no pretense in the film of attempting to be balanced or fair; on the contrary, he is puzzled by the suggestion that he do so.After all, as he says, the opinions coming from the environs of the Oval Office have hardly been balanced or fair.  And while one may argue that he has sometimes played fast and loose with the sequences of events, or the connections between various elements tied together in the movie, there are few outright falsehoods one can point to as an example of downright misrepresentation.He also quite cleverly puts the lie to the idea that protest or argument is somehow unpatriotic. This places an enormous burden on those who would argue one must remain silent in solidarity with the troops as a show of respect for their sacrifice. Yet it is hard to argue with Moore's logic that anyone who really cares about the welfare of the troops would take care not to misuse them or continue to place them needlessly or carelessly in harms' way. As James Bovard contends in his new book, suggesting, as Mr. Bush does continually, that by fighting the terrorists in Iraq we will avoid fighting them here, is at best an almost criminally nave notion, and at worst, a cynical and murderous misrepresentation of what is going down in Iraq.We are not becessarily there to preserve their freedom or ours, argues Mr. Moore, and any suggestion that such is the case will have a hard time explaining events that now transpire on an almost daily basis. Moore's intent was to ratchet up debate on the policies and practices and rationale of the neo-conservative regime current in power, and to suggest that perhaps Americans begin to question it and its motives much more closely. Thus, despite it dramatic excesses or its willingness to sometimes take liberties in connecting things which may or may not indeed be so tied, I believe in creating public controversy and stirring public debate the movie will be a stunning success, and that it may well lead to having some measurable resulting political impact on the election in the fall.

629753,A1Y1IMKX8ZRV4Y,B00005JNEI,Ben Adam,"[7, 13]","Michael Moore's film, Fahrenheit 9/11, generated considerable controversy with good reason. It is difficult to imagine anyone viewing the film, especially during 2004, an election year, without developing rather strong feelings about the subject matter. From the title of the film alone, the viewer prepares for a gut-wrenching experience in preparation for watching a documentary that intends to shoot from the hip and does so relentlessly and without apology. Producer/director Michael Moore's appearance in his own film makes it clear that he acts purely from personal motivation in creating such a film at such a strategic time. The question that many are trying to ask is: is Michael Moore pro-American, anti-American, anti-Bush, or what? How can any person conceive of such a disturbing film to show to a public that is still living in the trauma of the event s of September 11, 2001 unless he is trying to convey a message? Even more of a question is: just what are we supposed to understand from this film? Is this Michael Moore's day in the sun, or is it an indictment of President George W. Bush?Moore's dislike of President Bush and the Bush family is obvious from the start. The film paints a very negative picture of the Bush family as being driven only by oil-based wealth that is linked directly to the Bin Laden family, the Saudi royal family, and various personalities that are all apparently ""in on the deal"" in terms of generating profits from all the events that developed before and after September 11, 2001. Moore makes it a point of presenting the idea that the tragedy of September 11, 2001 was a carefully orchestrated event performed with the knowledge and, more than likely, consent of the Bush family at a time when Bush was, as the film states, ""on vacation"" as his popularity rating plunged. The film is truly a cynic's delight in making the point that everything that took place on September 11, 2001 had but one purpose: to generate more wealth for the Bush family and the Saudis, both of whom enjoy an immense amount of protection by the Secret Service.Moore's appearance in the film adds an element that makes him open for caustic criticism, as he is neither photogenic nor particularly tactful. The one element that compensates for what many may believe to be Moore's exaggerated ego in making himself a feature in his own film is the obvious sincerity in which he pursues his subject; nobody viewing the film can doubt that he believes very strongly in what he says. His visit back to his hometown of Flint, Michigan hits hard, as he shows the economic devastation in the city and the aggressive efforts to recruit the many young people affected by the economic blight into the military. The footage showing the bereaved family of Sergeant Michael Pedersen hits home in a way that cannot be ignored, unfortunately, by anyone viewing the film.The filmed carnage of the war in Iraq, a major feature of the film, evokes memories of the Vietnam War for persons old enough to remember that era; persons from later generations for whom the Vietnam War is only a name from history cannot ignore the grim reality that the war in Iraq is something that has already impacted American society permanently. The film, however, makes a compelling point that the one and only motive for launching the war in Iraq was commercial and suited the needs of the Bush oil empire more than protected the American people, which was the reason President Bush appears in the film as stating as the objective of the war. Add to that the sight of Lila Lipscombe, the mother of Sergeant Michael Pedersen , who, by her own admission, is a ""conservative Democrat"" and who states openly that she is proud to be American, weeping over her son's death, and the result is a frontal attack that provoked talk in the Bush administration of possibly banning the film. Had the Bush administration taken such an unprecedented measure, Michael Moore would have become a martyr nationwide immediately, and the impact of such an action on Bush's chances for re-election would have been felt acutely.The actual attack on September 11, 2001, interestingly enough, takes up so little time in the film that it might seem to some viewers almost insignificant, but it is, in fact, the focus of the entire film. Moore depicts the attack as an event of which the Bush administration had ample prior knowledge and could have prevented simply by monitoring the many Al Qaeda members, most of whom were Saudi nationals, residing in the United States and studying in American flight schools at the time the attack took place. President Bush is depicted as a President-on-vacation throughout the entire period of crisis, and the message that comes across is that the September 11, 2001 attack was only one part of a scheme to manipulate the public into a mindset of terror so that a grandiose scam could be carried out that would generate profits for American firms connected with defense contracting and fossil-fuel energy sources, as well as the Saudi royal family, who, according to the film, is so close to the Bush family as to be regarded as related.The film makes no pretense at being balanced in its views. No attempt is made to convince the viewer that the report is nonpartisan or unbiased. The audience sees exactly what Michael Moore wants it to see, and Moore does a superb job of presenting his views in a clear, concise manner on film. The viewer is, therefore, compelled to decide whether to accept the film as an accurate documentary or political propaganda aimed at dislodging George W. Bush from the Presidency. Bush's rather hostile policies toward the underprivileged sectors of the population will probably mean that the film will generate almost unanimous support of Moore's views, especially when they see the exploitation of the victims of the economy. In light of the way Moore pointed out accurately that many of the people living in the economic plight in the United States live in conditions not altogether different from those that exist in war-torn areas of Iraq at that time, persons who wondered if they had anything to hope for in terms of simple survival would surely have expressed their views in November 2004. History relates, however, that Bush was re-elected as President, so if Michael Moore's goal was to prevent re-election, clearly he did not achieve his goal.Is the film worth seeing? From a historical standpoint, it is. It is, however, definitely not for the faint of heart, and a person who seeks to keep stress levels down might find the film unduly upsetting. However, even if a viewer agrees or disagrees with Moore's documentary, the film has recorded beliefs held by the public that will not go away.",3,"Impossible to Ignore, Unfortunately",1107820800,"02

629754,A1TUDA3O519RYJ,B00005JNEI,"Benjamin Lukoff ""Benjamin Lukoff""","[5, 13]","I loathed ""Bowling for Columbine"" and am not a huge fan of Michael Moore in general, so I didn't expect to like this movie very much. My expectations were lowered further when I heard a friend of mine pan it--a friend who *liked* ""Columbine"" and last year's anti-capitalist screed ""The Corporation,"" which I found horribly biased. So, I was surprised to find myself liking it, and impressed at Moore's restraint in making a film that, while biased, is probably his least biased film to date.Now, there are some problems with the film. Moore doesn't fully explore the implications of some of what he says, as is his wont. But there's so much footage in here that needs to be seen and which *hasn't* been in the mainstream media. We haven't been shown our dead and maimed soldiers; we haven't been shown the dead and maimed Iraqi civilians; we haven't been shown our soldiers and their families refusing to toe the party line... and these are things we must see, to understand the consequences of our government's actions.If you'd rather remain ignorant of what's going on, skip this movie.

629755,A33693RRRFK55Q,B00005JNEI,"B. Erickson ""boycorrupted""","[17, 23]","Whew!  Ya know, I'm not sure, but I think this film may actually be anti-Bush.  I'd have to go see it again and take notes to really be sure - it's a bit subtle!OK, so ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is not exactly the most even-handed treatment of its subject(s).  I doubt whether anybody could argue that fact.  Actually, it's quite a pretty piece of vituperation directed squarely and ruthlessly at ""Dubbya"" and his administration for practically everything they have done since entering the White House.  It runs the gamut of anti-Bush sentiment, from the shady way he ""won"" the election, to the large percentage of time he spent on vacation before (and even after) 9/11, to the quite specific ties the Bush family has to the Bin Laden family (oh yes), to his hamfisted handling of the largest foreign attack ever on US soil, to his cursory military strike on Afghanistan to appease angry US citizens before hurling us into a ""premeditated, unprovoked"" war on Iraq, which is explained in ""9/11"" as basically a ""Blood for Oil"" expedition...and so on.  Michael Moore interviews bereaved moms and disillusioned soldiers, he corners senators on the street and asks them to enlist their children, he rides an ice cream truck around the capitol to read the Patriot Act to our elected officials (since apparently none of them bothered to read it before signing it into law), he takes every tack he can think of to cast the Bush Administration in the most unfavorable light possible.And in fact, he does succeed.  This movie will get a lot of people riled up.  I don't remember the last time I saw a film in the theatre and the audience erupted into applause every 5 minutes - but that's what happened here.  People WANT to see these points made.  They want an honest accounting of the events of the last 3 years, and they simply are not getting straight (or believable) answers from Washington.  Do they get it from Moore?  Well, at least they get a take-no-prisoners accounting from the other side.  In my opinion, one ought to take ALL opinions with a grain of salt - including mine! - but it's pretty obvious that a) Bush and his lackeys are not straight shooters, and b) Michael Moore is out to get them.  These things should be considered before buying into either side's story.I'd like to make this point though with reference to ""smear campaigns,"" since it's quite legitimate to describe this film as such.  Six years ago we actually impeached a president because he lied about an extramarital sex act.  Well, ""we"" didn't - rather the GOP made it their political raison d'etre to bash the Democrat, and they succeeded in appealing to the lowest common denominator of self-righteous sexual indignation to get their constituents behind it.  Now, yes, a lie is a lie, but on the other hand, all lies are NOT the same.  I daresay - let me make this controversial point - that whether or not Clinton got some action in the Oval Office is not quite as relevant to our daily lives as whether or not Bush lied about the election, the elusive WMDs, or the ultimate reason for the war itself, which has killed thousands of our young soldiers.  How is it that we can impeach one president over a stained dress, while the next one gets away with so many really heinous atrocities against the trust and security of the American people?  What kind of country IS this?  At the very least, we CANNOT re-elect Bush, if we all still want to be here for the next election.  God willing, this film will help and not hinder John Kerry, who is at least conclusively the ""lesser of two evils"" this time around.See this film!

No other one I've encountered included a disclaimer announcing that ""the following interviews and commentary are for entertainment only."" Such a warning is anathema to the goal of a documentary, which should be to educate. As far as entertainment value goes, however, you'd have to be a member of the tinfoil hat left (or those who think John Ashcroft's men interrogate librarians every other Monday) to get any meaningful information out of this film.What is most surprising is that, even from a technical standpoint, Moore's skills are overrated. The film drags on and on. It is devoid of drama as Moore cannot be bothered to showcase any conflicting points of view. Had he merely interviewed a couple of people who were not partisan Democrats he might have succeeded in making the film digestible, but he's simply not interested. If the plot were outlined in equation form, it would read: 2000 Election=Republican Plot, Iraq=Vietnam, Bush=Oppressor, Emotion=Fact, and Individual Suffering=Needed Alteration of Foreign Policy.By the end of the film one feels used and cheated. You may feel anger and indignation, but it's solely due to charlatans like Moore earning fortunes from the cobbling together of mendacious inuendos. It is rather depressing to watch such a cultural blockbuster and, with little concentration, think up five hundred responses which devastate Moore's positions. It's quite easy to do with Fahrenheit 9/11 as it relies chiefly on emotion. The director's emotophilia is even more pronounced in this film than it was in Bowling for Columbine. In the end we have only feeling. He spends over thirty minutes with a woman from Flint who tragically lost a son in Iraq. One feels sympathy for her until she abandons any sense of perspective by deciding that the result of her son's death will be for her to vent all of her rage and anguish in the direction of The White House and President George W. Bush. Moore couldn't be happier about her conclusion and hopes that you'll do the same.Before I saw the movie, allegations by commentators that the film violated McCain-Feingold struck me as unfair, but the evidence is in the reels. We hear from an injured soldier who states (I'm not kidding) that once he gets home the first thing he is going to do is become very active in his local Democratic Party. Go leftist young man! We also see the dour and self-righteous filmmaker on Capitol Hill attempting to convince Congressmen that they should sign their kids up for Iraq. This is yet another of his many ""emotional over all"" segments, but one begins to wonder here about Moore's intelligence. Does he really think that parents can enlist their sons without their consent? Does he even know that children are not allowed in the military? I heard him repeat this same line of anti-reasoning during an interview with Bill O'Reilly over the summer. His confusion here may be based on a utopian's ignorance about the mechanics of the real world.In retrospect, a more accurate title for this film would have been, The Eternal Bush, as its spirit and one-sidedness is remarkably similar to Goebbels' The Eternal Jew. All that is needed is a few shots of Republican legislators scampering into state houses like rats to complete the portrait. Obviously, it's quite fashionable to compare individuals to members of The Third Reich and I am loath to add my pen to the cultural totality of misapplied historical allusions, but Fahrenheit 9/11 is nothing more than an ideologue's checklist of propaganda.With Moore, most of his arguments refute themselves. One cannot believe that the Patriot Act is turning us into a police state when the very existence and celebration of Fahrenheit 9/11 disproves it. This is the freest country in the world and nothing better exemplifies our liberty than somebody like Michael Moore making millions from the dissemination of his anti-American propaganda. Perhaps he might consider naming his next film, ""Bush Made Me.""",1,Frequent Hate 9/11!,1099958400,"11 9, 2004",2004,4086,"['pressing', 'Play', 'one', 'immediately', 'aware', 'something', 'drastically', 'wrong', 'documentary', 'other', 'one', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'included', 'disclaimer', 'announcing', 'following', 'interviews', 'commentary', 'are', 'entertainment', 'only', 'Such', 'warning', 'anathema', 'goal', 'documentary', 'should', 'be', 'educate', 'As', 'far', 'entertainment', 'value', 'however', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'member', 'tinfoil', 'hat', 'left', 'who', 'think', 'John', 'Ashcroft', 'men', 'interrogate', 'librarians', 'other', 'Monday', 'get', 'meaningful', 'information', 'most', 'surprising', 'even', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'Moore', 'skills', 'are', 'overrated', 'film', 'drags', 'devoid', 'drama', 'Moore', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'bothered', 'showcase', 'conflicting', 'points', 'view', 'Had', 'merely', 'interviewed', 'couple', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'partisan', 'Democrats', 'might', 'have', 'succeeded', 'making', 'film', 'digestible', 'simply', 'not', 'interested', 'plot', 'were', 'outlined', 'equation', 'form', 'would', 'read', '2000', 'Election=Republican', 'Plot', 'Iraq=Vietnam', 'Bush=Oppressor', 'Emotion=Fact', 'Individual', 'Suffering=Needed', 'Alteration', 'Foreign', 'Policy.By', 'end', 'film', 'one', 'feels', 'used', 'cheated', 'may', 'feel', 'anger', 'indignation', 'solely', 'due', 'charlatans', 'Moore', 'earning', 'fortunes', 'cobbling', 'together', 'mendacious', 'inuendos', 'rather', 'depressing', 'watch', 'cultural', 'blockbuster', 'little', 'concentration', 'think', 'up', 'five', 'hundred', 'responses', 'devastate', 'Moore', 'positions', 'quite', 'easy', 'do', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'chiefly', 'emotion', 'director', 'emotophilia', 'even', 'more', 'pronounced', 'film', 'was', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'end', 'have', 'only', 'feeling', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'woman', 'Flint', 'who', 'tragically', 'lost', 'son', 'Iraq', 'One', 'sympathy', 'sense', 'perspective', 'deciding', 'result', 'son', 'death', 'will', 'be', 'vent', 'rage', 'anguish', 'direction', 'White', 'House', 'President', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'Moore', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'happier', 'conclusion', ""'ll"", 'do', 'same.Before', 'saw', 'movie', 'allegations', 'commentators', 'film', 'violated', 'McCain-Feingold', 'struck', 'unfair', 'evidence', 'reels', 'hear', 'injured', 'soldier', 'who', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding', 'once', 'first', 'thing', 'going', 'do', 'become', 'very', 'active', 'local', 'Democratic', 'Party', 'Go', 'leftist', 'young', 'man', 'also', 'see', 'dour', 'self-righteous', 'filmmaker', 'Capitol', 'Hill', 'attempting', 'convince', 'Congressmen', 'should', 'sign', 'kids', 'up', 'Iraq', 'yet', 'many', 'emotional', 'segments', 'one', 'wonder', 'here', 'Moore', 'intelligence', 'really', 'think', 'parents', 'can', 'enlist', 'sons', 'consent', 'even', 'know', 'children', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'military', 'heard', 'repeat', 'same', 'line', 'anti-reasoning', 'interview', 'Bill', ""O'Reilly"", 'summer', 'confusion', 'here', 'may', 'be', 'based', 'utopian', 'ignorance', 'mechanics', 'real', 'world.In', 'retrospect', 'more', 'accurate', 'title', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Eternal', 'Bush', 'spirit', 'one-sidedness', 'remarkably', 'similar', 'Goebbels', 'Eternal', 'Jew', 'needed', 'few', 'shots', 'Republican', 'legislators', 'scampering', 'state', 'houses', 'rats', 'complete', 'portrait', 'Obviously', 'quite', 'fashionable', 'compare', 'individuals', 'members', 'Third', 'Reich', 'am', 'loath', 'add', 'pen', 'cultural', 'totality', 'misapplied', 'historical', 'allusions', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'nothing', 'more', 'ideologue', 'checklist', 'propaganda.With', 'Moore', 'most', 'arguments', 'refute', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'Patriot', 'Act', 'turning', 'police', 'state', 'when', 'very', 'existence', 'celebration', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'freest', 'country', 'world', 'nothing', 'better', 'exemplifies', 'liberty', 'somebody', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'making', 'millions', 'dissemination', 'anti-American', 'propaganda', 'Perhaps', 'might', 'consider', 'naming', 'next', 'film', 'Bush', 'Made', 'Me']",Fahrenheit 9/11

Michael Moore is a liberal and isn't ashamed of it.  In fact he's proud of it, revels in it, trying to take back the word stolen from the left during the Reagan Era.Michael Moore is a brave man, taking on a sitting president during a time where the very rights and freedoms guaranteed us by the constitution are being questioned.  This period will be looked back upon as a very dark time in US history.  We now have brownshirts like Ann Coulter bandying about words like ""traitor"" and ""sedition"" when anyone questions the current government - a government that stole the 2000 election, and as a result, a government whose very legitimacy is questionable.The aggressively populist position of Michael Moore is succeeding where a quarter century of ""kid glove"" leftist rhetoric has failed.  He's taking on the bellicose right with a solid dose of their own medicine and IT'S WORKING.  The amazing thing to watch are the ensuing attacks on Mr. Moore not by the right, but by the leftist elite criticizing Mr. Moore for his tactics.  It's the business-as-usual-Democratic Party policy of eating itself from within.  The left has a tendency to try to be all things to all people, thus ending up being nothing to anyone.  This is best exemplified by the party's decision to choose John Kerry to be their presidential candidate, while a man of principles and ideas like Howard Dean is cast aside.  It's time for the left to stop relying on voters being willing to vote against ""the other side"" and give them ideas and positions worth voting FOR.Michael Moore understands this.  People have criticized this film for having a point of view.  It's a documentary and all documentaries come from a point of view, stating their case.  The real complaint is that this fat, grizzled, ball cap wearing guy with a camera is actually making a point and making more of a difference than all the usual suspects combined.  Michael Moore is through letting the right define what it is and what it means to be a liberal, to be a patriot.This movie is about the Presidency of George W. Bush and the terrible things that this inept, inarticulate puppet of the oil industry has done to maintain that ever-so-important flow of cheap oil.  It's about lives lost, lives ruined and a country losing the hard earned respect of the world.  Michael Moore gets his point across very effectively, forcing the viewer to ask the difficult questions they may not want to ask of themselves.Is it fair?  Of course not, but like anyone with a strong opinion, they're not going to BE fair when it comes to their beliefs.  It's up to you to make up your own mind whether Mr. Moore's opinions have merit.  You may not agree with him, but you SHOULD be asking yourself these questions.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[5, 19]","I remember (not too long ago) when Rush Limbaugh was having a field day with President Clinton's marital infidelity and the Whitewater debacle. In fact, there was nearly an impeachment over it. An impeachment! Over something that had nothing to do with American policy (foreign or otherwise).I'm a registered Democrat (yep, I sit on the left side pretty comfortably), but I had to eat some crow when I found out my man, Mr. President himself, had lied to the public about his affair with the young intern (and possibly others like Jennifer Flowers). I had to ""zip"" my lips shut because what he'd done was wrong. And he finally had to admit it. Shame on him. But does such an action deserve as much media attention as it got, and a near impeachment?Now let's zoom to the current date and Mr. Moore's film. Here we have a President who pretty much stole the White House (there is room for argument here, but when your brother is the Governor of Florida, and that was the deciding state with such a closely contested presidential run, you have to have some doubts about the validity of it.). We also have a President who's business acumen is less than impressive prior to becoming the Commander-In-Chief. And he probably didn't even know who the Heads of States were in any other country besides those in the western hemisphere (I'll let his foreign policy speak for itself here). None of this is impeachable either, but you can see where this is going. President Bush is, in my humble opinion, a moron, a puppet President. I felt this way before going in to see Fahrenheit 9/11, and felt it even stronger after watching the film.But let's talk about the validity of Mr. Moore's film for a moment and not get too political (well ...as best we can anyway).The Bad: Mr. Moore tries hard to make ties between the Bin Laden family and the Bush family. I think we can safely say that he didn't do this very well in the film. It's kind of like six degrees of separation, and when you're in politics those connections can be made in even less than six degrees. The thing that struck me as ""bad"" about this portion of the film was that all of these connections were made long before the events surrounding the 9/11 attacks. That would be like the lead paint industry being blamed for ground water contamination since there was no way to know (at the time the paints were made) that lead was really that ""bad."" This might be an overly-simplistic example, but I didn't want to lose anyone so early on. You get the point.The Good: Well, pretty much everything else. Oh sure, Michael Moore's documentary is extremely stilted toward the anti-Bush sentiment. But did that really surprise anyone? If you read newspapers or magazines at all, you HAD TO HAVE KNOWN about the controversy surrounding this film before its release in the U.S. (which almost didn't happen).For some reason, President Bush reminds me of Gerald Ford. But while Ford stumbled physically (to the excitement of Chevy Chase and the Saturday Night Live gang), President Bush stumbles mentally and professionally. He can't make decisions without someone telling him what to do (if there's any doubt about this, just watch the first 1/3 of the film where he's been notified of TWO planes hitting the Twin Towers, but does nothing for many minutes while doing some PR work at a school. Not very flattering). And then, if you can handle it, watch the end of the film when he tries to remember a famous quote and, again, looks like a complete idiot (I guess no one could get to the teleprompter quick enough).Throughout the film the anti-Bush message is strong but if there is another message, it's that fear is even stronger. Similar to Mr. Moore's BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE documentary, this film also focuses on the fears that drive our decisions, and how the current administration fed those fears to its own advantage (the colored code alerts for the country, the new homeland security branch, and the impossible and improbable links between the 9/11 attacks and Saddam Hussein).Is this film for everyone? Definitely not. Is it something to be watched-with a kernel of skepticism-by those who wish to see it? Most definitely so.It certainly is a film to be reckoned with in the documentary world.

Michael Moore's often buffoonish approach to disarming the objects of his attacks is less effective in this film, mostly due to the seriousness of the subject. I would have preferred that a more intellectual director would have tackled this one. It's pretty easy to make George W. Bush look like a moron: all you need to do is present footage of him talking. I've read a great deal about the Bush family and this movie taught me nothing new (that doesn't mean YOU shouldn't see it though). Furthermore, the fact that Moore casually insinuates conspiracy theories based on a relationship between the Bush family and the bin Ladens is a little obnoxious. Like all Moore films, this movie is a bit chaotic and fails to really stay on target with any sort of statement other than ""Bush sucks."" This is definately entertainment, NOT a thesis backed up by relevant points. One minute the soldiers in Iraq are heroic victims of Bush's policies, and then suddenly later they are portrayed as bloodthirsty meatheads. The movie is all over the place. I prefer more academic ""documentaries"" (if you can even call this a documentary). If you are not very aware about current events or politics, this movie might be helpful to you. Otherwise, I would recommend movies like ""Control Room"" or ""Manufacturing Consent"" (or anything with Noam Chomsky's name on it for that matter). This movie seems counter-productive to the very necessary discussion on the conflicts between Christian and Islamic cultures, the effect of U.S. foreign policy on other countries, and the real roots of terrorism. Films like this are calculated to achieve an emotional response that will stir people up and make money. Certainly there are important points made and I do agree that Bush is an incompetant president, but I am uncomfortable with Moore's overall approach. Still, the movie is very much worth seeing. It includes a lot of footage that you won't see anywhere else very easily. However, the film isn't as good as Moore's ""Bowling For Columbine,"" and I predict that in another 10-15 years, people will have forgotten all about ""Farenheit 911.""",3,Subject is too serious for such mud-slinging entertainment.,1103500800,"12 20, 2004",2004,2203,"['As', 'powerful', 'movie', 'times', 'was', 'disappointed', 'overall', 'presentation', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'often', 'buffoonish', 'approach', 'disarming', 'objects', 'attacks', 'less', 'effective', 'film', 'mostly', 'due', 'seriousness', 'subject', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'more', 'intellectual', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'tackled', 'one', 'pretty', 'easy', 'make', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'look', 'moron', 'need', 'do', 'present', 'footage', 'talking', ""'ve"", 'read', 'great', 'deal', 'Bush', 'family', 'movie', 'taught', 'nothing', 'new', ""n't"", 'mean', 'YOU', 'should', ""n't"", 'see', 'Furthermore', 'fact', 'Moore', 'casually', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'based', 'relationship', 'Bush', 'family', 'bin', 'Ladens', 'little', 'obnoxious', 'Moore', 'films', 'movie', 'bit', 'chaotic', 'really', 'stay', 'target', 'sort', 'statement', 'other', 'Bush', 'sucks', 'definately', 'entertainment', 'NOT', 'thesis', 'backed', 'up', 'relevant', 'points', 'One', 'minute', 'soldiers', 'Iraq', 'are', 'heroic', 'victims', 'Bush', 'policies', 'then', 'suddenly', 'later', 'are', 'portrayed', 'bloodthirsty', 'meatheads', 'movie', 'place', 'prefer', 'more', 'academic', 'documentaries', 'can', 'even', 'call', 'documentary', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'aware', 'current', 'events', 'politics', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'helpful', 'Otherwise', 'would', 'recommend', 'movies', 'Control', 'Room', 'Manufacturing', 'Consent', 'anything', 'Noam', 'Chomsky', 'name', 'matter', 'movie', 'counter-productive', 'very', 'necessary', 'discussion', 'conflicts', 'Christian', 'Islamic', 'cultures', 'effect', 'U.S.', 'foreign', 'policy', 'other', 'countries', 'real', 'roots', 'terrorism', 'Films', 'are', 'calculated', 'achieve', 'emotional', 'response', 'will', 'stir', 'people', 'up', 'make', 'money', 'Certainly', 'are', 'important', 'points', 'made', 'do', 'agree', 'Bush', 'incompetant', 'president', 'am', 'uncomfortable', 'Moore', 'overall', 'approach', 'Still', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'seeing', 'lot', 'footage', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'anywhere', 'else', 'very', 'easily', 'However', 'film', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'Moore', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'predict', '10-15', 'years', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'forgotten', 'Farenheit', '911']",Fahrenheit 9/11

That review moved me more than any out of the 711 I searched through to find it. It was so moving that I just wanted to write and say as for all the rest all I could think is that it is just a movie and if it offended one person who puts his life on the line for our country and flat tells you why and the reasons were very good and his information not long and drawn out but more informative than all the opinions I read and all I wished was I could of found that one review which moved me so much because he gave some facts from the frontline and he loved his country and is trying to do his job and that he was offended by this movie and I think that said it all. So because the movie has made it's way into my home and not by me because I was not even going to watch it because of the pain it caused just that one person putting his life on the line and believing in the cause I can only add how sorry I am that you are there and gave some facts that I completely  believed more than this unbelievable amount of reviews without facts and only opinions. I would just like to say I enjoyed your review and still have not saw the movie but would like to say I am sorry that you were offended and pray you are well and make it back home to the America you love!!!! God Bless You. Thanks for the facts. Be Safe. God Bless America and God Bless You for what you are doing and because you love your country. I believe in you and not some stupid movie.And I am a movie lover. But it seems to me this one is not going to be a movie that i will find entertaining and there are so many that are very entertaining. I love art , but not just total clueless bashing.I hope Bush gets us out of Iraq and you are a true american whom touched my soul and I hope all these other reviewers read your review which was to the point and the best review I read. It is very late or early depending on how you look at 5:15am and I am only sorry I could not find your review but maybe now that I have let others know where you are they may have the chance to read it. It seems these days they will pay the most money for the lowest type of charaters. It is really shocking what vulgur types get paid. I still have not seen the movie but it is so shocking these days what type famous people get paid millions to be vulgur. I bet I do not have to explain that. But instead maybe they should be paying more for our military men like you who truly love your country. Been up all night and am a bit cranky but just wanted to hopefully get others to read your review. Maybe even Mr Moore??When I first read your review it was on the first 3 or 4 pages.I have not been able to find it up to the 700's. I only mentioned the fact about the millions paid to vulgur types because maybe and I cannot be positive on this because I have not seen this movie but it sounds like a bunch of speculation bashing of the president. I do not like movies that are maybe in bad taste and less artistic. From the reviews it sounds more like personal opinions. Mean Spirited. But when it offends the very people who are defending our country and believe in the cause it can't be a good thing.

From all of the hype, I didn't want a film to determine who I voted for as the next president of the United States of America.  After watching Fahrenheit 9/11 with my entire family, I was saddened before that George W. Bush was in office, but now, I am more saddened that he is.  Moreso, I am disappointed in the American people who truly believe this film has no value to it and who choose to believe this was soley an attempt for Michael Moore to make money.  Maybe it was, or maybe it wasn't.  Who cares?  The fact is, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that there's certainly some truth to this story. We as American Citizens owe it to ourselves to know the truth about the individuals who hold the key to this country's future. In addition, we owe it to ourselves to make sure this country is headed in the right direction for our children...their children, etc. Michael Moore did a superb job educating, not pursuading, coaxing or manipulating me into what he wanted me to see, but instead he educated me on what I needed to know as an African American Citizen living in the United States today. I truly thank him for the ""eye opening course"" and I encourage everyone to purchase this DVD for educational purposes as well. It will certainly wake you up. Whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, Black, White, Hispanic...whatever, we are still Americans who deserve to know the truth about our leaders. I encourage you to open your eyes because there's no doubt we're moving in the wrong direction. Isn't it time that we got back on the right track?  I'd say America is well over due...wouldn't you?

FARENHEIT 9/11 is one long OP ED piece to justify why Michael Moore thinks the way he does about Iraq and Bush.  Even in interviews he says ""This is based on my opinions!""  All facts presented support his argument, and they are all true.  But he is presenting only the items supporting his view!  It's something talk radio hosts and political candidates have mastered over the years, and is nothing new.  Rush Limbaugh would find a close and fast friend in Moore if they could put aside their ideology.The movie is entertaining and disturbing all at once.  Never boring, always engaging!  It's a great 2 hours no matter what politics are behind it.  Masterfully edited, beautifully scored, and well stated throughout.  Gone are the usual Moore stunt interviews, and present are some truly heart-breaking moments ... most notably with a mother who loses a son in the war.  I don't care what side of the politics you are on - the segments with Linda Lipscomb going to Washington DC after her son has been killed captures how a patriot feels after losing her child.

It's a gripping and involved satire that digs deeper than any other film that director Michael Moore has done. With media footage and file footage about Bush and others, the film covers a veriety of subjects, including the patriot act, Bush's past oil connections and others.Michael Moore does an amazing job of getting the facts to the view. Unlike his other films, Moore rarely appears on camera, letting the film clips and interviews speak for him. This let's the viewer get the full story, rather than just stare at some guy who is talking about Bush.The emotion is high in this movie. Graphic scenes of war-devastated cities in Iraq, a collection of scenes with a mother mourning over her sons death in war, and a thought provoking look at Iraq in the month leading up to America's attacks. However, there a comical parts, and the film has a satirical edge. From stealing a ice cream truck to read the patriot act to Congress or playing back a stupid remark that Bush had said.This film is genius. It's sad that it did not effect the election, but it is good to know that there are people like Michael Moore out there who still feel the need to change something. The braveness in this film and the unbelievable amounts of data collected in it's entirity make it a film like no other. A film that not only is based on facts, but based on human emotions.

629778,A1NPNGWBVD9AK3,B00005JNEI,"Bruce Kendall ""BEK""","[186, 318]","I had high expectations for this film. Winner of the prestigious Palm d'or at Cannes. Widely praised, even begrudgingly so by some reviewers from a traditionally right wing perspective. Good word of mouth from some fellow reviewers for whom I have great respect. Too bad it didn't really deliver.I give it a middle of the road rating, because I found the film about half enjoyable. It's very well edited and generally moves at an excellent pace. There are some truly funny bits, especially the montages of Bush and his cabinet getting made up for various televesion appearances. Attorney General Ashcroft serenading the faithful is not to be missed. The usual assortment of Bushisms and the now infamous 7 minute scene of The Commander in Chief sitting with the kiddies after being informed of the second tower being hit. Moore hits the mark there.At other times, he misses the target completely. The segment in the ice cream truck was funny for about ten seconds, then nada. The bushwacking (pardon the pun) of the Republican Congressmen outside the capital was simply a concept whose outcome was predetermined. That Moore actually got any politician from the right to stop and speak to him speaks well only of those who were brave enough to engage him. It was a cloyingly empty exercise on his part. Which strikes to the heart of the matter of my problem with Moore. True, he acknowledges his bias, as if that alone were enough to get him off the hook in regards to presenting us with a &quot;realistic&quot; viewpoint. I don't expect objectivity from a documentary filmmaker, but I do expect a slightly less corrupted presentation. For instance, when he first inteviews the mom in Flint, MI who acts as a thread for his anti-war stance, it's obvious that she doesn't know of Moore's muckraking history. He basically nods in agreement when she delivers her views about the military and how proud she is of her family's collective contribution to the Armed Forces. He doesn't give her any hint that he has a hidden agenda. Then later in the film, he comes very close to exploiting the poor woman when she learns that her only son has been killed in Iraq. Moore has become infamous for this tactic (playing both sides of the fence, as when he pretended to be a gun lover in BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE).I also don't think Moore is half so funny or clever as he thinks he is. One half hour of THE DAILY SHOW with John Stewart delivers more laughs and more finely wrought political satire than does two hours here.There are definitely quite a few things that Moore gets right, however. The slow motion photography of the rain of paper after the collapse of the twin towers was very moving, as was the accompanying soundtrack. The brutal, graphic war footage is something every voting American should see. Many won't want to and never will, but there is no way one can idealize the carnage of war after viewing those images.On the whole, Moore does succeed in his indictement of the Bush administration and its single minded pursuit of regime change in Iraq at any cost. I can't say that he taught me anything I didn't already know before. I was hoping he would. Thus the disappointment. I still say it is a film that people should see, if only as a reminder of how far politics has sunk in this new millenium.BEK",3,A Bit Disappointing,1089676800,"07 13, 2004",2004,3304,"['had', 'high', 'expectations', 'film', 'Winner', 'prestigious', 'Palm', ""d'or"", 'Cannes', 'Widely', 'praised', 'even', 'begrudgingly', 'so', 'reviewers', 'traditionally', 'right', 'wing', 'perspective', 'Good', 'word', 'mouth', 'fellow', 'reviewers', 'whom', 'have', 'great', 'respect', 'Too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'deliver.I', 'give', 'middle', 'road', 'rating', 'found', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'very', 'well', 'edited', 'generally', 'moves', 'excellent', 'pace', 'are', 'truly', 'funny', 'bits', 'especially', 'montages', 'Bush', 'cabinet', 'getting', 'made', 'up', 'various', 'televesion', 'appearances', 'Attorney', 'General', 'Ashcroft', 'serenading', 'faithful', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'usual', 'assortment', 'Bushisms', 'now', 'infamous', '7', 'minute', 'scene', 'Commander', 'Chief', 'sitting', 'kiddies', 'being', 'informed', 'second', 'tower', 'being', 'hit', 'Moore', 'mark', 'there.At', 'other', 'times', 'target', 'completely', 'segment', 'ice', 'cream', 'truck', 'was', 'funny', 'about', 'ten', 'seconds', 'then', 'nada', 'bushwacking', 'pun', 'Republican', 'Congressmen', 'capital', 'was', 'simply', 'concept', 'outcome', 'was', 'predetermined', 'Moore', 'actually', 'got', 'politician', 'right', 'stop', 'speak', 'speaks', 'well', 'only', 'who', 'were', 'brave', 'enough', 'engage', 'was', 'cloyingly', 'empty', 'exercise', 'part', 'heart', 'matter', 'problem', 'Moore', 'True', 'bias', 'alone', 'were', 'enough', 'get', 'off', 'hook', 'regards', 'presenting', 'quot', 'realistic', 'quot', 'viewpoint', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'objectivity', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'do', 'expect', 'slightly', 'less', 'corrupted', 'presentation', 'instance', 'when', 'first', 'mom', 'Flint', 'MI', 'who', 'thread', 'anti-war', 'stance', 'obvious', ""n't"", 'know', 'Moore', 'muckraking', 'history', 'basically', 'nods', 'agreement', 'when', 'views', 'military', 'how', 'proud', 'family', 'collective', 'contribution', 'Armed', 'Forces', ""n't"", 'give', 'hint', 'hidden', 'agenda', 'Then', 'later', 'film', 'very', 'close', 'exploiting', 'poor', 'woman', 'when', 'only', 'son', 'been', 'killed', 'Iraq', 'Moore', 'become', 'infamous', 'tactic', 'playing', 'sides', 'fence', 'when', 'pretended', 'be', 'gun', 'lover', 'BOWLING', 'FOR', 'COLUMBINE', '.I', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Moore', 'so', 'funny', 'clever', 'One', 'half', 'hour', 'THE', 'DAILY', 'SHOW', 'John', 'Stewart', 'more', 'laughs', 'more', 'finely', 'wrought', 'political', 'satire', 'two', 'hours', 'here.There', 'are', 'definitely', 'quite', 'few', 'things', 'Moore', 'right', 'however', 'slow', 'motion', 'photography', 'rain', 'paper', 'collapse', 'twin', 'towers', 'was', 'very', 'moving', 'was', 'accompanying', 'soundtrack', 'brutal', 'graphic', 'war', 'footage', 'something', 'voting', 'American', 'should', 'see', 'Many', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'never', 'will', 'way', 'one', 'can', 'idealize', 'carnage', 'war', 'viewing', 'whole', 'Moore', 'succeed', 'indictement', 'Bush', 'administration', 'single', 'minded', 'pursuit', 'regime', 'change', 'Iraq', 'cost', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'taught', 'anything', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'Thus', 'disappointment', 'still', 'say', 'film', 'people', 'should', 'see', 'only', 'reminder', 'how', 'far', 'politics', 'sunk', 'new', 'millenium.BEK']",Fahrenheit 9/11

629780,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00005JNEI,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[13, 18]","Michael Moore has made a name for himself as the consummate documentary director, creating many movies that present his take on a critical issue and that chronicle the moods of Americans and the world at the time. Fahrenheit 9/11 continues Moore's foray into political documentaries, this time focusing on the war against Iraq and the man who got us into the mess, George W. Bush.Moore spends most of this documentary talking about the war, but he begins the film with a presentation on the election of 2000 and how Republicans and their colleagues helped to rig the election in favor of Bush by purging minority groups from the voter roles in Florida. Then, he quickly shifts gears to the war itself, showing the president sitting in the Florida classroom as one of his aides whispers in his ear that the U.S. is under attack.What follows from there is Moore's attack on the president and his war, showing how Bush and his team manipulated facts and twisted the truth to get the American people to approve the war effort. Moore makes many personal attacks on Bush and he portrays the president as having a one- track mind and as being rather stupid. One of the major criticisms of this film is how it takes things out of context, and this does appear to be a valid complaint. Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and others are shown making quotes to the camera and sometimes, they are quoted out of context. Moore includes a quote when he needs one, to drive his points home, regardless of how the quote was originally intended.Where this documentary succeeds most is when it sticks to the facts. The parts that talk about the phony weapons of mass destruction claim and the use of fear to sell the war to the people are among the best in the documentary. Another thing that keeps the movie entertaining is Moore's sarcastic wit. One of the funniest moments in the film comes when Moore decides to drive an ice cream truck around the U.S. Capital and read the provisions of the anti Patriot Act through a loudspeaker. He does this after learning (accurately) that most of the people in congress voted for this anti- liberty measure without even bothering to read it.Besides the quotes taken out of context and the attempts to make Bush look either like a complete fool or a cold, uncaring villain, there are a few other things I didn't care for. I didn't like the sidetracking by Moore, such as when he shows scenes of abandoned businesses and houses from his hometown of Flint, Michigan- similar to what was shown in his first documentary, Roger and Me. And I felt he got a little carried away with Lila Lipscomb and her concerns about young people going off to war. This adds some good drama to the film, but I would prefer if he stuck with the facts.Fahrenheit 9/11 is a pretty good documentary even though it's obviously one- sided and gives no opportunities for any opposing viewpoints. Many people are angered at Moore for making this documentary while others applaud his efforts with great enthusiasm. Whatever position you take, you should still take some time out to watch this documentary. It shows how a group of people can successfully manipulate the truth and then add a dose of fear to the equation to convince millions of people that armed conflict is necessary and moral.",4,We Gotta Get out of This Place,1101686400,"11 29, 2004",2004,3276,"['Michael', 'Moore', 'made', 'name', 'consummate', 'documentary', 'director', 'creating', 'many', 'movies', 'present', 'take', 'critical', 'issue', 'chronicle', 'moods', 'Americans', 'world', 'time', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'Moore', 'foray', 'political', 'documentaries', 'time', 'focusing', 'war', 'Iraq', 'man', 'who', 'got', 'mess', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush.Moore', 'most', 'documentary', 'talking', 'war', 'film', 'presentation', 'election', '2000', 'how', 'Republicans', 'colleagues', 'helped', 'rig', 'election', 'favor', 'Bush', 'purging', 'minority', 'groups', 'voter', 'roles', 'Florida', 'Then', 'quickly', 'shifts', 'gears', 'war', 'showing', 'president', 'sitting', 'Florida', 'classroom', 'one', 'aides', 'whispers', 'ear', 'U.S.', 'Moore', 'attack', 'president', 'war', 'showing', 'how', 'Bush', 'team', 'manipulated', 'facts', 'twisted', 'truth', 'get', 'American', 'people', 'approve', 'war', 'effort', 'Moore', 'many', 'personal', 'attacks', 'Bush', 'president', 'having', 'one-', 'track', 'mind', 'being', 'rather', 'stupid', 'One', 'major', 'criticisms', 'film', 'how', 'things', 'context', 'appear', 'be', 'valid', 'complaint', 'Bush', 'Cheney', 'Rumsfeld', 'others', 'are', 'shown', 'making', 'quotes', 'camera', 'sometimes', 'are', 'quoted', 'context', 'Moore', 'quote', 'when', 'one', 'drive', 'points', 'home', 'regardless', 'how', 'quote', 'was', 'originally', 'intended.Where', 'documentary', 'most', 'when', 'facts', 'parts', 'talk', 'phony', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'claim', 'use', 'fear', 'sell', 'war', 'people', 'are', 'best', 'documentary', 'thing', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'Moore', 'sarcastic', 'wit', 'One', 'funniest', 'moments', 'film', 'when', 'Moore', 'drive', 'ice', 'cream', 'truck', 'U.S.', 'Capital', 'read', 'provisions', 'anti', 'Patriot', 'Act', 'loudspeaker', 'learning', 'accurately', 'most', 'people', 'congress', 'voted', 'anti-', 'liberty', 'measure', 'even', 'bothering', 'read', 'quotes', 'taken', 'context', 'attempts', 'make', 'Bush', 'look', 'complete', 'fool', 'cold', 'uncaring', 'villain', 'are', 'few', 'other', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'did', ""n't"", 'sidetracking', 'Moore', 'such', 'when', 'scenes', 'abandoned', 'businesses', 'houses', 'hometown', 'Flint', 'Michigan-', 'similar', 'what', 'was', 'shown', 'first', 'documentary', 'Roger', 'Me', 'felt', 'got', 'little', 'carried', 'away', 'Lila', 'Lipscomb', 'concerns', 'young', 'people', 'going', 'war', 'good', 'drama', 'film', 'would', 'prefer', 'stuck', 'facts.Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'pretty', 'good', 'documentary', 'even', 'obviously', 'one-', 'sided', 'opportunities', 'opposing', 'viewpoints', 'Many', 'people', 'are', 'angered', 'Moore', 'making', 'documentary', 'others', 'efforts', 'great', 'enthusiasm', 'position', 'take', 'should', 'still', 'take', 'time', 'out', 'watch', 'documentary', 'how', 'group', 'people', 'can', 'successfully', 'manipulate', 'truth', 'then', 'add', 'dose', 'fear', 'equation', 'convince', 'millions', 'people', 'armed', 'conflict', 'necessary', 'moral']",Fahrenheit 9/11

His final thought in the film is an important one - after all the lies told about why we went to Iraq, why would anybody ever trust us again? Also, and somewhat off-topic, I have to wonder how it is that Michael Moore was able to see the damage that such quotable quotes from conservative politicians could do, and yet then-presidential candidate John Kerry could not? If I had been running Mr. Kerry's campaign I would have been constantly rewinding and replaying the moment when President Bush is speaking at a fundraiser talking about ""his base - also known as the haves and the have mores"".

Be sure to read the full version -- with extensive references -- at davekopel.com, not the brief PDF summary.  It's true that Kopel includes some minor and debatable points, but most of the complaints are fair -- and devastating.Moore's ""Factual Back-Up"" on his Web site (michaelmoore.com) is fascinating, in a perverse way.  He simply ignores many of the serious flaws noted by Kopel and others, while offering proof of other facts that no one has disputed.  Most amusing is his brazen audacity in citing references that actually *undermine* his position.  To defend his statement that ""Gore got the most votes in 2000,"" Moore quotes from articles entitled ""Recount Provides No Firm Answers"" and ""Review of Ballots Finds Bush's Win Would Have Endured Manual Recount.""  No kidding!  Check it out for yourself.Of course Moore falls back on selective quotation when necessary.  For example, no one disputes that Fox was the first network to call Florida for Bush, but Moore conveniently omits the fact that CNN and CBS were the first to retract it for Gore.  Moore's ""Factual Back-Up"" is a jewel of misdirection; he simply omits the following key segment from page 15 of the CNN report he cites:""9:54 p.m.: The Decision Team recommends that CNN and CBS retract their Florida calls for Gore.  The two do so and are the first networks to retract ....""It is depressing to think that more people saw this trashy schlock on its opening weekend than will *ever* see Jhally and Earp's superb anti-Bush documentary ""Hijacking Catastrophe.""",2,"Good intentions, sleazy filmmaking",1095811200,"09 22, 2004",2004,2346,"['Yes', 'possible', 'dislike', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', '*and*', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'did', 'not', 'vote', 'Bush', '2000', 'will', 'emphatically', 'not', 'be', 'voting', '2004', 'not', 'however', 'make', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'better.Moore', 'movie', 'repellent', 'pseudo-documentary', 'tragic', 'lost', 'opportunity', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'intelligent', 'witty', 'film', 'emerges', 'instead', 'sleazy', 'hatchet', 'job', 'embodying', 'journalistic', 'ethics', 'supermarket', 'tabloid', 'notorious', 'fake', 'news', 'clipping', 'really', 'letter', 'editor', 'false', 'date', 'deceptive', 'editing', 'continuous', 'barrage', 'grossly', 'misleading', 'innuendos', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'masterpiece', 'distortion', 'con', 'artistry', 'worthy', 'Bush', 'himself.Dave', 'Kopel', 'put', 'together', 'widely-read', 'list', '59', 'Deceits', 'Moore', 'documentary', 'Be', 'sure', 'read', 'full', 'version', 'extensive', 'references', 'davekopel.com', 'not', 'brief', 'PDF', 'summary', 'true', 'Kopel', 'minor', 'debatable', 'points', 'most', 'complaints', 'are', 'fair', 'devastating.Moore', 'Factual', 'Back-Up', 'Web', 'site', 'michaelmoore.com', 'fascinating', 'perverse', 'way', 'simply', 'many', 'serious', 'flaws', 'noted', 'Kopel', 'others', 'offering', 'proof', 'other', 'facts', 'one', 'disputed', 'Most', 'amusing', 'brazen', 'audacity', 'citing', 'references', 'actually', 'position', 'defend', 'statement', 'Gore', 'got', 'most', 'votes', '2000', 'Moore', 'articles', 'entitled', 'Recount', 'Provides', 'No', 'Firm', 'Answers', 'Review', 'Ballots', 'Finds', 'Bush', 'Win', 'Would', 'Have', 'Endured', 'Manual', 'Recount', 'kidding', 'Check', 'out', 'yourself.Of', 'course', 'Moore', 'back', 'selective', 'quotation', 'when', 'necessary', 'example', 'one', 'Fox', 'was', 'first', 'network', 'call', 'Florida', 'Bush', 'Moore', 'conveniently', 'fact', 'CNN', 'CBS', 'were', 'first', 'retract', 'Gore', 'Moore', 'Factual', 'Back-Up', 'jewel', 'misdirection', 'simply', 'following', 'key', 'segment', 'page', '15', 'CNN', 'report', '9:54', 'p.m.', 'Decision', 'Team', 'CNN', 'CBS', 'retract', 'Florida', 'Gore', 'two', 'do', 'so', 'are', 'first', 'networks', 'retract', 'depressing', 'think', 'more', 'people', 'saw', 'trashy', 'schlock', 'opening', 'weekend', 'will', '*ever*', 'see', 'Jhally', 'Earp', 'superb', 'anti-Bush', 'documentary', 'Hijacking', 'Catastrophe']",Fahrenheit 9/11

The movie does not tell you what to think and if you don't believe something in the movie then you still will not believe it when the movie is over so what is the harm in watching this movie?!  I absolutely love this movie.  I was opened up to Michael Moore when I watched Bowling for Columbine and have been following him closely since then.  I wanted to see this movie at the movie theater, yet the people who I know did not want to go and support this movie...their choice!  I did however buy it the day it came out and was pleased I bought it.  I absolutely love it and it opened my eyes to controversies that I thought might be happening, but was sure how they would go about it.  I think my favorite part in the movie was when Michael Moore and a recruiter for the military stood outside the Capital building and tried to Recruit the children of government people.  Just funny how they don't want to send their own kids but would send everyone else's in a heartbeat.  Food for thought...I also loved the way it went from serious to silly and also posed thought provoking questions.  I think everyone should watch this movie at least once and if you don't like it then don't watch it again!  Everyone is entitled to an opinion and if you don't watch this movie and  judge it,  then you are spreading ignorance,  if you watch this movie and then don't like it at least you will have a base to go from!  I don't think this movie will change opinions but I think it will provide food for thought.  My biggest peeve is that people who have not seen this movie talk about how bad it is...yet they have nothing to base that opinion on!  This movie is in no way unpatriotic!

Bush. Among the many facts that cause audience members to gasp when they see this film are:--The illegal manner in which the Bush team rigged the election in Florida largely by disenfranchising eligible Black Democrat voters.--The fact that the Bush family has done business with terrorists (namely the bin Laden family) for decades and treasonously allowed the bin Laden family to leave the United States immediately after the attacks of September 11th , before other flights were allowed to resume and before the FBI could question them.--The fact that far from showing ""courage and leadership"" immediately after the attacks of September 11th, unelected President Bush sat in a class room for several minutes reading ""My Pet Goat"" to children with a stunned expression on his face.--The fact that the Bush regime manipulated legitimate fears of terror among the nation's citizens mostly with bizarre warnings and a meaningless color code system in order to force through a deeply unpopular right wing agenda of social and economic policies that are extremely harmful to all but the most wealthy Americans. Actually, in the long run these policies will destroy them too, they are just too short-sited to realize this.--The fact that not one congressional leader read the totalitarian provisions of the USAPATRIOT Act before voting for it. Not one.--The fact that the Bush regime abandoned all but the rhetoric behind the war on terror in order to pursue its pre-election dream of colonizing Iraq.--The fact that the situation is Iraq is a disaster. We are destroying peoples' lives, and randomly arresting and torturing people there. Our troops are getting killed and wounded in a war that is based exclusively on the lies of George W. Bush and on the aims of right wing zealots and oil companies.--The fact that American companies flagrantly admit that the war in Iraq is a colonial occupation from which they profit.--The fact that none of the children of war proponents ever have to risk their lives in this war, only the poor do.None of this is new of course to anyone who read political biographies and newspapers. The accomplishment of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is that it captures a lot of publicly available information that has previously been relegated to the back pages of newspapers and brings it into our movie houses and living rooms so that even the most delusional of us can no longer pretend that the Bush Regime is legitimate and that it knows what it's doing.",5,Imperfect but sadly enough it's right on the money,1092787200,"08 18, 2004",2004,2711,"['Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'share', 'faults', 'definitely', 'one', 'very', 'important', 'thing', 'current', 'climate', 'rightwing', 'information', 'dominance', 'systematically', 'apart', 'lies', 'secrets', 'unelected', 'regime', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'many', 'facts', 'cause', 'audience', 'members', 'gasp', 'when', 'see', 'film', 'are', 'illegal', 'manner', 'Bush', 'team', 'rigged', 'election', 'Florida', 'largely', 'disenfranchising', 'eligible', 'Black', 'Democrat', 'voters.', 'fact', 'Bush', 'family', 'done', 'business', 'terrorists', 'namely', 'bin', 'Laden', 'family', 'decades', 'treasonously', 'allowed', 'bin', 'Laden', 'family', 'leave', 'United', 'States', 'immediately', 'attacks', 'September', '11th', 'other', 'flights', 'were', 'allowed', 'resume', 'FBI', 'could', 'question', 'them.', 'fact', 'far', 'showing', 'courage', 'leadership', 'immediately', 'attacks', 'September', '11th', 'unelected', 'President', 'Bush', 'sat', 'class', 'room', 'several', 'minutes', 'reading', 'Pet', 'Goat', 'children', 'stunned', 'expression', 'face.', 'fact', 'Bush', 'regime', 'manipulated', 'legitimate', 'fears', 'terror', 'nation', 'citizens', 'mostly', 'bizarre', 'warnings', 'meaningless', 'color', 'code', 'system', 'order', 'force', 'deeply', 'unpopular', 'right', 'wing', 'agenda', 'social', 'economic', 'policies', 'are', 'extremely', 'harmful', 'most', 'wealthy', 'Americans', 'Actually', 'long', 'run', 'policies', 'will', 'destroy', 'too', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'short-sited', 'realize', 'this.', 'fact', 'not', 'one', 'congressional', 'leader', 'read', 'totalitarian', 'provisions', 'USAPATRIOT', 'Act', 'voting', 'Not', 'one.', 'fact', 'Bush', 'regime', 'abandoned', 'rhetoric', 'war', 'terror', 'order', 'pursue', 'pre-election', 'dream', 'colonizing', 'Iraq.', 'fact', 'situation', 'Iraq', 'disaster', 'are', 'destroying', 'peoples', 'lives', 'randomly', 'arresting', 'torturing', 'people', 'there', 'troops', 'are', 'getting', 'killed', 'wounded', 'war', 'based', 'exclusively', 'lies', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'aims', 'right', 'wing', 'zealots', 'oil', 'companies.', 'fact', 'American', 'companies', 'flagrantly', 'admit', 'war', 'Iraq', 'colonial', 'occupation', 'profit.', 'fact', 'none', 'children', 'war', 'proponents', 'ever', 'have', 'risk', 'lives', 'war', 'only', 'poor', 'do.None', 'new', 'course', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'political', 'biographies', 'newspapers', 'accomplishment', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'lot', 'publicly', 'available', 'information', 'previously', 'been', 'relegated', 'back', 'pages', 'newspapers', 'movie', 'houses', 'living', 'rooms', 'even', 'most', 'delusional', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'pretend', 'Bush', 'Regime', 'legitimate', 'what', 'doing']",Fahrenheit 9/11

He clearly does criticize and make fun of the president, but the film goes way beyond that.It spells out clearly in a way everyone can understand the web of business relationships that the president's critics charge have tainted his handling of foreign policy.  It puts a face to the suffering of the families of the people killed in the invasion and occupation of Iraq.The movie is completely biased against President Bush, but it still is a valid documentary.  No one going into the movie should expect it to be unbiased.I can sort-of understand how right wing ideologues feel appalled to see a feature length film criticizing their point of view.  After all, I can't think of a mainstream film this critical of the left.

Both parties are so far gone from normal Americans, it's high time we removed them both.That being said, this apparently is an important film, because people are talking and that is ultimately what every film hopes to achieve. Yet!! Remember something. Many of the antidotes and messages portrayed are products of keen editing and conjecture by a democrat. Films are illusions and Fahrenheit 9.11 is plain and simple propaganda.Because President Bush sat thinking in front of a classroom of children after being told of the attack on New York. We're supposed to believe there is something wrong with that? What is he Superman? Supposed to spring up and run out of the room? CHILDREN!! Would any normal person not think about how to carefully walk this line sitting in front of a classroom of children?  Yet, the movie spins a different tale, VOICED OVER by Michael Moore who TELLS US what Bush is THINKING!!Osama Bin Laden's family was flown out of the country despite all planes being grounded. What's the assumption here? How about looking at the real truth. Bin Laden's family denounced Osama long ago. They are peaceful people and after what happened, they feared for their lives, rightfully so. Besides, the FAA has since stated that there is no record of this flight or any other.Bush knows the Bin Laden family. So what? Wealthy people like the Bushs, the Bin Ladens, the Kerrys and the rest of our politicians make up about 2% of the worlds population. Is it so shocking and scandalous that they know each other?Politicians putting on makeup for the camera... uh... that's normal. Anybody who knows anything about T.V. would know that. Cheap shot.Another cheap shot was showing the video of the people of Iraq, playing and shopping before the war. Awful? Yes. Sad? Yes. War is awful, but I'm sure you could have seen the very same thing in Germany before WW2.  Was removing Hitler wrong?Is it wrong that security was guarding the Saudi Arabian embassy? Maybe if it were a tank, or a S.W.A.T. team, but one guy!!  Come on Michael!!Documentaries in their truest form are UNBIASED and tell us stories with CAMERA, not with VOICE OVER. Moore took his video and talked over it, inputting his own biased democratic opinion.Bush meeting with Al Queda before 9.11 is called a President's job. Presidents meet with all leaders and heads of states at various times for various reasons. Clinton had many cordial visits with Yassar Arafat, does that make him a member of Hamas?Ever heard the phrase: ""Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer""?Michael Moore took stock video of Bush and others in these meeting and subjectively inserted his own words.The best moments of the movie were when he let the camera speak for itself. Like when the politician admitted that they never read entire bills before passing them, or when he asked politicians about enlisting their sons. That's documentary film making!  Unfortunately, most of Fahrenheit 9.11 is Michael Moore voice over propaganda.A true documentary would have also told the story of the Priest and his congregation that went to Iraq to protest before everything happened. When he got there, he was faced with an onslaught of Iraqi's who told him gruesome stories of the things that Saddam had done to the people of Iraq, and they wanted to know when we were coming to remove him. He promptly returned to the U.S. with a publicly changed mind.Moore proved something though. The power of film is great. You can show images and voice over nearly an entire film with your opinions and many many people will believe everything you say.In my opinion, treat 9.11 like today's biased network newscasts. Make sure you know which network your watching and don't believe everything you hear.If you truly want to get a view of the FACTS behind Fahrenheit 9.11, watch it, but also watch FahrenHYPE 9.11. Another documentary that shows how much of Michael Moore's speel was based on lies and baseless information.Finally, if any democrats came out of watching Fahrenheit 9.11 and thought that members of their own party were immune to the same shifty government practices and BIG MONEY favoritism, think again!  Both parties are guilty of these things and if you think otherwise... YOU'RE A FOOL.I was sort of a fan of Michael Moore before 9.11. But, after watching this, I have lost all respect for him. He has ABUSED his power, disgraced our military and has at numerous times in this film, lied about things to suit his agenda, or maybe JUST DIDN'T DO HIS HOMEWORK, and that to me is irresponsible and unforgiveable.Moore should be excited about one thing though, apparently Osama Bin Laden has now seen his movie... and has given it two thumbs up.",2,Documentary with VOICE OVER bias and KEEN

629801,AENI3U0Z7UJBH,B00005JNEI,Christine Lee,"[16, 20]","Michael Moore is the type of man who has his fair share of detractors as well as supporters, but don't let that deter you from watching this movie.The film begins with footage of jubilant Democrats celebrating what they believe to be the victory of Al Gore as the new President of the United States of America, but alas, that happiness is short-lived with the startling news that, in fact, GEORGE W BUSH IS THE NEW PRESIDENT!How did this debacle happen? How could a spoilt, over grown child like George W Bush possibly succeed the intelligent and sophisticated President Clinton as President of the most powerful nation in the world? Simple, get your brother and some of your Daddy's friends help you cheat on the vote recount in the state of Florida, where your brother happens to be the governor, and convince Dad's friends in the Supreme Court to rule in your favour in spite of glaring oversights, and blatant evidence of voter tampering.Cut straight to the blackest day in the history of the 21st century, and we see footage showing that on the day the Twin Towers were destroyed, George was visiting a primary school to read with the kids (assuming the man had the intelligence to read as well as the kids!). And while the nation was in a state of sheer naked panic, George just sits there in the classroom and barely blinks an eye.The second half of the film then concentrates on the Iraqi battleground, and the very human cost of war. The most poignant moment of the film is Lila Lipscombe reading the last letter her son wrote her from the Iraqi field before he was killed in action. He tells her that he and the other troops don't know why they are there, they don't want to be there, they all just want to come home to their families.But perhaps the most galling aspect of this film, second to the gruesome images from Iraq, are the existence of a business relationship between the Bush and Bin Laden families. The implication being that this war on Iraq was instigated in order for Bush and co. to make millions (billions?!), but all at the expense of 3000 innocent lives lost on September 11, 2001.Many detractors have gone for the juggular, and accused Moore of fabricating many facts, some going as far as accusing Moore of telling outrageous lies. But prior to seeing this film I read several books regarding this subject, one of them was 'September 11' by Noam Chomsky, 'Five Biggest Lies Bush Told Us About Iraq' by Christopher Scheer, Robert Scheer and Lakshmi Chaudry just to name a few. These books had already exposed Bush for the sycophantic bully that he is.And yes, I for one hope that he falls flat on his arse by losing the next election.For anyone out there who was skeptical about the connection between Al_queda and Saddam, or if you wondered how did it go that Osama Bin Laden was deemed responsible for September 11, and yet somehow, Bush suddenly declared war on Iraq WATCH THIS MOVIE.Just a point of interest, the Bush administration claimed there was a relationship between Saddam Hussein and the Al-Queda group based on the fact that Mohamed Atta (one of the leading hijackers) was in Prague the same time an Iraqi official was visiting the city of Prague. There were several claims that they held a meeting, but oddly enough, the 'sources' which claimed that they spoke at length were untraceable to all. And there has never been any evidence that the two men ever met, only that they were in the same city at the same time.So, like I said, watch this movie yourself, and decide whether or not the real axis of evil (Bush, Blair and Howard) deserve to win their respective elections or not.Another four years? More like another 6 weeks for Bush.",4,"The Awful Truth, the sequel",1095984000,"09 24, 2004",2004,3682,"['Michael', 'Moore', 'type', 'man', 'who', 'fair', 'share', 'detractors', 'as', 'well', 'supporters', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'deter', 'watching', 'movie.The', 'film', 'footage', 'jubilant', 'Democrats', 'celebrating', 'what', 'believe', 'be', 'victory', 'Al', 'Gore', 'new', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'alas', 'happiness', 'short-lived', 'startling', 'news', 'fact', 'GEORGE', 'W', 'BUSH', 'THE', 'NEW', 'PRESIDENT', 'How', 'did', 'debacle', 'happen', 'How', 'could', 'spoilt', 'grown', 'child', 'George', 'W', 'Bush', 'possibly', 'succeed', 'intelligent', 'sophisticated', 'President', 'Clinton', 'President', 'most', 'powerful', 'nation', 'world', 'Simple', 'get', 'brother', 'Daddy', 'friends', 'help', 'cheat', 'vote', 'recount', 'state', 'Florida', 'where', 'brother', 'be', 'governor', 'convince', 'Dad', 'friends', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'rule', 'favour', 'spite', 'glaring', 'oversights', 'blatant', 'evidence', 'voter', 'tampering.Cut', 'straight', 'blackest', 'day', 'history', '21st', 'century', 'see', 'footage', 'showing', 'day', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'were', 'destroyed', 'George', 'was', 'visiting', 'primary', 'school', 'read', 'kids', 'assuming', 'man', 'had', 'intelligence', 'read', 'as', 'well', 'kids', 'nation', 'was', 'state', 'sheer', 'naked', 'panic', 'George', 'just', 'there', 'classroom', 'barely', 'blinks', 'eye.The', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'then', 'Iraqi', 'battleground', 'very', 'human', 'cost', 'war', 'most', 'poignant', 'moment', 'film', 'Lila', 'Lipscombe', 'reading', 'last', 'letter', 'son', 'wrote', 'Iraqi', 'field', 'was', 'killed', 'action', 'other', 'troops', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'are', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'there', 'just', 'want', 'come', 'home', 'families.But', 'perhaps', 'most', 'galling', 'aspect', 'film', 'second', 'gruesome', 'images', 'Iraq', 'are', 'existence', 'business', 'relationship', 'Bush', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'families', 'implication', 'being', 'war', 'Iraq', 'was', 'instigated', 'order', 'Bush', 'co.', 'make', 'millions', 'billions', 'expense', '3000', 'innocent', 'lost', 'September', '11', '2001.Many', 'detractors', 'have', 'gone', 'juggular', 'accused', 'Moore', 'fabricating', 'many', 'facts', 'going', 'as', 'far', 'accusing', 'Moore', 'telling', 'outrageous', 'lies', 'prior', 'seeing', 'film', 'read', 'several', 'books', 'regarding', 'subject', 'one', 'was', '11', 'Noam', 'Chomsky', ""'Five"", 'Biggest', 'Lies', 'Bush', 'Told', 'Us', 'Iraq', 'Christopher', 'Scheer', 'Robert', 'Scheer', 'Lakshmi', 'Chaudry', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'books', 'had', 'already', 'exposed', 'Bush', 'sycophantic', 'bully', 'is.And', 'yes', 'one', 'hope', 'flat', 'arse', 'losing', 'next', 'election.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'skeptical', 'connection', 'Al_queda', 'Saddam', 'wondered', 'how', 'did', 'go', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'was', 'deemed', 'responsible', 'September', '11', 'yet', 'somehow', 'Bush', 'suddenly', 'declared', 'war', 'Iraq', 'WATCH', 'THIS', 'MOVIE.Just', 'point', 'interest', 'Bush', 'administration', 'claimed', 'was', 'relationship', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'Al-Queda', 'group', 'based', 'fact', 'Mohamed', 'Atta', 'one', 'leading', 'hijackers', 'was', 'Prague', 'same', 'time', 'Iraqi', 'official', 'was', 'visiting', 'city', 'Prague', 'were', 'several', 'claims', 'held', 'meeting', 'oddly', 'enough', ""'sources"", 'claimed', 'spoke', 'length', 'were', 'untraceable', 'never', 'been', 'evidence', 'two', 'men', 'ever', 'met', 'only', 'were', 'same', 'city', 'same', 'time.So', 'said', 'watch', 'movie', 'decide', 'not', 'real', 'axis', 'evil', 'Bush', 'Blair', 'Howard', 'deserve', 'win', 'respective', 'elections', 'not.Another', 'four', 'years', 'More', '6', 'weeks', 'Bush']",Fahrenheit 9/11

With Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore presents his admittedly biased case against Bush and the war being waged in Iraq. Unfortunately, when you're watching a Michael Moore film, you never know what to think because the only information you are privy to is presented to support his own views.Fahrenheit 9/11 is split up into basically two parts: the first is an indictment of President George W. Bush, the way he has run the country, and his motives for starting a war in Iraq; the second focuses on the people fighting the war, and is easily the better piece of the film.Moore makes the case that the presidential election of 2000 was a sham because votes from racial minorities were not counted appropriately, and that had they been, Al Gore would have won the election. Regardless, we all know that Bush did win, and in August of 2001, he decided to take a rather long vacation, with which some in the country took issue. Bush didn't seem to be terribly serious about his job--until September 11, and we all know what happened then.What was our president doing when he heard the news that two planes hit the World Trade Center in New York? Reading to children in Florida. What did he do for seven full minutes after hearing this news? Absolutely nothing. Why? Well, this film provides us with some background, linking the Bin Laden family with the Bush family through the oil industry, in which both families are major players. So, members of the Bin Laden clan were rounded up and flown out of the country immediately after the terrorist attacks on the WTC. Why?Fahrenheit 9/11 also accuses Bush of manufacturing the war in Iraq, claiming that he invented ties between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda and weapons of mass destruction in order to rally the American people behind the war effort, which was only for his own personal financial gain. Is this true? Who knows?So where does this film succeed? It succeeds in telling the story of Lila Lipscomb, a Flint, Michigan native who, when we first meet her, is a fervent military supporter, citing that the military helps young people who otherwise wouldn't have a chance to get education and travel the world. However, after her son is killed in combat in Iraq, Ms. Lipscomb becomes disillusioned, questioning why her son had to die, and what good it did for anybody.Moreso than in his other films, Michael Moore managed to stay off camera for a good part of Fahrenheit 9/11, though his voice is heard throughout in narration. When he is on the screen, he is usually grandstanding, like when he asks for Congressmen to enlist their own children in the military. A true documentarian observes and lets the audience make a judgment for themselves, but that is not Moore's M.O. He wants to present an impartial story, and he does, and I wish I could believe every word of it, but with Moore, you never really know.",3,Typical Moore - some provocative stuff surrounded by bias,1111190400,"03 19, 2005",2005,2912,"['American', 'who', ""n't"", 'live', 'cave', 'could', 'tell', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'Moore', 'presents', 'admittedly', 'biased', 'case', 'Bush', 'war', 'being', 'waged', 'Iraq', 'Unfortunately', 'when', ""'re"", 'watching', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'film', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'think', 'only', 'information', 'are', 'privy', 'presented', 'support', 'own', 'views.Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'split', 'up', 'basically', 'two', 'parts', 'first', 'indictment', 'President', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'way', 'run', 'country', 'motives', 'starting', 'war', 'Iraq', 'second', 'focuses', 'people', 'fighting', 'war', 'easily', 'better', 'piece', 'film.Moore', 'case', 'presidential', 'election', '2000', 'was', 'sham', 'votes', 'racial', 'minorities', 'were', 'not', 'counted', 'appropriately', 'had', 'been', 'Al', 'Gore', 'would', 'have', 'won', 'election', 'Regardless', 'know', 'Bush', 'did', 'win', 'August', '2001', 'decided', 'take', 'rather', 'long', 'vacation', 'country', 'took', 'issue', 'Bush', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'terribly', 'serious', 'job', 'September', '11', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'was', 'president', 'doing', 'when', 'heard', 'news', 'two', 'planes', 'hit', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'New', 'York', 'Reading', 'children', 'Florida', 'What', 'did', 'do', 'seven', 'full', 'minutes', 'hearing', 'news', 'Absolutely', 'nothing', 'Why', 'Well', 'film', 'background', 'linking', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'family', 'Bush', 'family', 'oil', 'industry', 'families', 'are', 'major', 'players', 'So', 'members', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'clan', 'were', 'rounded', 'up', 'flown', 'country', 'immediately', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'WTC', 'Why', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'also', 'Bush', 'manufacturing', 'war', 'Iraq', 'claiming', 'invented', 'ties', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'al', 'Qaeda', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'order', 'rally', 'American', 'people', 'war', 'effort', 'was', 'only', 'own', 'personal', 'financial', 'gain', 'true', 'Who', 'So', 'where', 'film', 'succeed', 'telling', 'story', 'Lila', 'Lipscomb', 'Flint', 'Michigan', 'native', 'who', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'fervent', 'military', 'supporter', 'citing', 'military', 'helps', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'otherwise', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'chance', 'get', 'education', 'travel', 'world', 'However', 'son', 'killed', 'combat', 'Iraq', 'Ms.', 'Lipscomb', 'becomes', 'disillusioned', 'questioning', 'why', 'son', 'had', 'die', 'what', 'good', 'did', 'anybody.Moreso', 'other', 'films', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'managed', 'stay', 'off', 'camera', 'good', 'part', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'voice', 'heard', 'narration', 'When', 'screen', 'usually', 'grandstanding', 'when', 'Congressmen', 'enlist', 'own', 'children', 'military', 'true', 'documentarian', 'observes', 'audience', 'make', 'judgment', 'not', 'Moore', 'M.O', 'present', 'impartial', 'story', 'wish', 'could', 'believe', 'word', 'Moore', 'never', 'really', 'know']",Fahrenheit 9/11

Moore carefully lays out what appears to be very shady goings on in the post 9/11 America, and the Bush administration in general.  I will say that I found some of his arguments and fact gathering very intriquing.  Ya gotta give the man credit for dogged research.That being said, he is very selective about which facts he reveals, and how he lights them.  For instance...one segment has him talking to Secret Service agents guarding the Saudi embassy.  It would appear that the Saudi's are given special treatment by the secret service.  However...Moore fails to mention that ALL foreign embassies have assigned Secret Service agents.  There are several instances of selective fact statement, so I think it's important to remember that some of his more astounding 'black/white' angles do have decided shades of gray.What I appreciate about this film, and why I do recommend it, is because it sparked me to do my own fact finding and come to my own conclusion about the arguments displayed in the film.  It made me think, and actually motivated me to find out more about my government, and to help educate myself on my choice for president.

After only about 15 minutes of the constant little conspiracies thrown in one after the other I started laughing and then began to wonder why this film was considered so provocative by so many people. All Moore did was show Bush doing something like playing golf, while making small remarks like, ""Isn't it about time you got to work George?"" Apparently GWB spent his first 8 months on the golf course?? Yes it is that silly. He remarked that it looked like GWB was going to be a lame duck president, lame duck after only after 8 months, are we kidding? Especially, after the huge division Gore created when he demanded a re-count after he lost the election. A re-count in only a select few democrat counties. I guess what they really meant was ""Let every democrat vote count and count and count and count!"" One more thing, which is worse a president that spends his time playing golf, or one who spends his time getting BJ's in the oval office, no wonder we had the first world trade center bombings, Oklahoma city bombing, Waco, Ruby Ridge, the pull out in Somalia, the massacre in Rwanda, the attack on the Cole, the US embassy attacks in Africa, held to the same standards, Clinton looks pretty pathetic.I also thought it was really funny that Moore actually believes the entire world was somehow influenced by FOX NEWS when announcing GWB president. Fox was not even considered much competition back in 2000, so why would any news network base their coverage on what Fox had reported? Especially since they are considered a really conservative slanted station, right? Does this make any sense? I guess everyone at CNN and MSNBC sit around and watch FOX news to determine what facts to report. If this were true they all should be removed from the air.Moore would also show columns from a newspaper written by some liberal and then stress that they are indeed fact. Almost all the people I saw interviewed had a book bashing Bush or was some other flaming liberal fanatic.What was the point of showing Bush and others in the administration getting ready for the camera with make-up artists, etc., etc. Are we to believe the every single democrat went on air after 9-11 looking like they did when they woke up in the morning. He also tried to insinuate that the footage was on sept. 11 right after the attacks. He did this by showing the date sept. 10 then immediately after showing the edited for liberals Sept. 11 footage (to liberals 9-11 was apparently just a few papers flying in the air, dust and some really upset people.) the film jumps right to members of the Bush administration getting ready for the camera, while the credits roll. How could they be so vain after what just happened?His constant attempt to make Bush look like an evil money grubbing, Saudi loving, oil corrupted, moron backfired and I found myself impressed by Bush even more than I already had been. This movie was just too much hype and it became a broken record really, really fast. Moore claims he loves this country, if he expressed this type of love to his wife would they still be married? Can you imagine if he made a movie about his wife by constantly bashing her and telling her how terrible she is and how messed up she is, and then giving no solution to the apparent problem? What Moore should of done instead was just filmed himself in front of the white house holding a sign that read ""I hate George W. Bush and America so much I can't stand it!""

Middleton,"[10, 25]","This is an astonishing film; it is astonishing because of Moore's courage to expose president Bush and his present cronies' blatant connection to corporate America, making loads of money from the spoils of the Iraqi war, (these connections are a matter of public record). It is sickening to realize that these so-called leaders are making a disgusting amount of money from the deaths of American boys and innocent Iraqi children. Further to this, the insidious method this administration applied through the media, the out-right propaganda, to justify attacking a sovereign country, spreading fear about terrorism and placing Iraq in the ""terrorist mix"", when Iraq does not have weapons of mass destruction, nor are hiding terrorists and have done nothing to the American people, was blatant dishonesty and frightening in every sense of the word. The Bush family are connected to the bin Laden family, also public record. (Their business partners for goodness sake!) It is also public record that the only people allowed to fly, when the whole country was grounded and on red alert after 9'11, was the bin Laden family. Before the smoke even cleared after the destruction of the Twin Towers in New York, the bin Laden family was high tailing out of town, with the approval from the Bush administration - also public record. It has been three years since 9'11, and the masterminds behind and responsible for this terrible act of terror, Osama bin Laden in particular, has never been brought to justice. Why? Have we forgotten about this man, is he no more a threat to us, or has he been conveniently swept under the rug, lost behind the smoke of the (unnecessary) Iraq war? The answer to this question is a simple one: money, lots of money, and its Saudi Arabian money.Australians were lied to as well. Our media has never really taken our prime minister to task about Iraq. The only reason, the main reason, our prime minister sent Australian troops to Iraq was the threat of WMD'S. Well there were never any weapons, but our politicians, like Las Vegas magicians, divert our attention with one hand, while doing something else in the other - slight of hand. Our media should be ashamed of themselves, because journalism is no more about truth but about pushing the party line. People are dieing and those at the top are making millions and the media continue to focus our attentions away from this ghastly reality. Sadly, however, looking at the election results, we continue to buy the lies, hook, line and sinker.Michael Moore had an obvious agenda when making this film.

To those who rant that this documentary is propaganda and anti-Bush, let me remind you that Mr. Moore uses network and archived footage aired nationally and internationally - there's no Hollywood staging. He is also practicing his civil liberties and Constitutional rights to criticize an administration that is violating those rights. The very rights that, supposedly, Bush paid lip service to when selling and fooling America into thinking that we needed to free the Iraquis and save us from the gloom and doom that would fall upon us ""any day now"" unless we got rid of Saddam.Mr. Moore's use of network news footage is brilliant and disturbing at the same time. It was very telling to see and hear some of our troops high on adrenalin rush, stating how ""cool"" it was to shoot 'em up while listening to loud music CDs inside the tanks - then later get their sobering statements after witnessing the damage they had done to innocent Iraqis. This, in itself, was worth watching.Yes, Mr. Moore omits some facts that all of us are now aware of (the 9/11 review papers were released after the documentary was finished) - and his personal opinions and views are quite obvious. But whether you are a Republican, a Democrat, a Green Party member, or an independent, you will walk away wondering whether the entire Bush administration thinks that we are all puppets and idiots who can be manipulated by spin masters.Watch this documentary and draw your own conclusions - but do not rely on someone else's views to deter you from it.

There is no doubt that MM has few peers in agitprop, but he has become a magnificent filmmaker, as well. He understands how to truly manipulate an audience without resorting to the cheese of a Steven Spielberg. Evidence of this comes from the fact that the most bravura moment of his latest filmic screed against President George W. Bush comes not from the humanzee grins of our leader- especially in the 7 minutes of paralysis after being told of the attacks, nor the oafish military recruiters he follows about poor urban malls, nor even the distorted ethics of exploiting a grieving mother whose son has died in Iraq or trying to paint the Saddam-era Iraq as a place where carefree children flew kites & all was well- despite over a million bodies in mass graves over the 3 decades of his American-backed rule, but by NOT showing us a replay of the horrific fall of the Twin Towers on 9/11. He understands that the viewers memory of the event will be far more powerful than seeing it, again, for the umpteenth time.... On the + side, the film is at its best when it takes on its own- exposing the utter fallacy of the `liberal media' during the lead up to & during the war. Rather, Brokaw, Jennings, & co. are shown as the sycophantic corporate daisy-chainers they really are- not once calling the Bush Administration on its, now proven, bevy of lies about the war. Of course, given the recent death & apotheosis of &uuml;ber-moronic ex-President Ronald Reagan by the media, it's a shame many need MM to state the obvious. Another highpoint is the connection between the fact that it is Bush's American poor & uneducated fighting the Arab world's poor & uneducated- a fact of wars since their start.Instead of being a detailed journalistic `true documentary' Fahrenheit 9/11 is a disorganized mess of a film, however occasionally brilliant, that has only 1 unifying theme- a hatred for George W. Bush. As admirable as this may be in real life, it does not suffice in reel life. I suspect, though, that reel life is where MM prefers to reside, for their he can solipsistically sneer at the American public he repeatedly (& not wrongly, mind you) derides as being stupid, yet Sisyphanly attempts to sway, even though few of those who should see the film will, & those who do already agree with its tenets. A similar phenomenon occurred earlier this year when it was the Conservatives' turn to rail against what & who they hate with The Passion Of The Christ. Sadly, despite all the wisdom MM wishes to impart to the American people he fails to heed 1 of the oldest nostrums in the book: choose your enemies well, because that's who you'll most likely resemble. & from where I sit, that ain't pretty!",3,Good agitprop,1221091200,"09 11, 2008",2008,2816,"['Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'yet', 'example', 'potentially', 'talented', 'artist', 'taking', 'easy', 'way', 'doubt', 'MM', 'few', 'peers', 'agitprop', 'become', 'magnificent', 'filmmaker', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'truly', 'manipulate', 'audience', 'resorting', 'cheese', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Evidence', 'fact', 'most', 'bravura', 'moment', 'latest', 'filmic', 'screed', 'President', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'not', 'humanzee', 'grins', 'leader-', 'especially', '7', 'minutes', 'paralysis', 'being', 'told', 'attacks', 'oafish', 'military', 'recruiters', 'poor', 'urban', 'malls', 'even', 'distorted', 'ethics', 'exploiting', 'grieving', 'mother', 'son', 'died', 'Iraq', 'trying', 'paint', 'Saddam-era', 'Iraq', 'place', 'where', 'carefree', 'children', 'flew', 'kites', 'was', 'well-', 'million', 'bodies', 'mass', 'graves', '3', 'decades', 'American-backed', 'rule', 'NOT', 'showing', 'replay', 'horrific', 'fall', 'Twin', 'Towers', '9/11', 'viewers', 'memory', 'event', 'will', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'powerful', 'seeing', 'again', 'umpteenth', 'time', '+', 'side', 'film', 'best', 'when', 'own-', 'exposing', 'utter', 'fallacy', 'liberal', 'media', 'lead', 'war', 'Rather', 'Brokaw', 'Jennings', 'co.', 'are', 'shown', 'sycophantic', 'corporate', 'daisy-chainers', 'really', 'are-', 'not', 'once', 'calling', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'now', 'proven', 'bevy', 'lies', 'war', 'course', 'given', 'recent', 'death', 'apotheosis', 'uuml', 'ber-moronic', 'ex-President', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'media', 'shame', 'many', 'need', 'MM', 'state', 'obvious', 'highpoint', 'connection', 'fact', 'Bush', 'American', 'poor', 'uneducated', 'fighting', 'Arab', 'world', 'poor', 'uneducated-', 'fact', 'wars', 'start.Instead', 'being', 'detailed', 'journalistic', 'true', 'documentary', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'disorganized', 'mess', 'film', 'however', 'occasionally', 'brilliant', 'only', '1', 'unifying', 'theme-', 'hatred', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'As', 'admirable', 'may', 'be', 'real', 'life', 'not', 'suffice', 'reel', 'life', 'suspect', 'though', 'reel', 'life', 'where', 'MM', 'prefers', 'reside', 'can', 'solipsistically', 'sneer', 'American', 'public', 'repeatedly', 'not', 'wrongly', 'being', 'stupid', 'yet', 'Sisyphanly', 'sway', 'even', 'few', 'who', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'will', 'who', 'do', 'already', 'agree', 'tenets', 'similar', 'phenomenon', 'occurred', 'earlier', 'year', 'when', 'was', 'Conservatives', 'turn', 'rail', 'what', 'who', 'hate', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'Sadly', 'wisdom', 'MM', 'impart', 'American', 'people', 'heed', '1', 'oldest', 'nostrums', 'book', 'choose', 'enemies', 'well', 'who', ""'ll"", 'most', 'likely', 'resemble', 'where', 'sit', 'ai', ""n't"", 'pretty']",Fahrenheit 9/11

You will like or dislike it on a purely visceral level that has nothing to do with craftsmanship, writing, or sense. I happen to think that it contains many provable falsehoods, but so what? A film like this is not about convincing anybody with data.A great many people believe fiercely that every word of this film is the gospel truth, and even more that it contains enough truth to be thought provoking. There is a school of thought that believes that FDR knew about the Japanese plans to attack Perl Harbor well in advance, and deliberately sacrificed the men who died in that attack for a pretext to get into WW II. Director/writer Moore's film is the same kind of reasoning. It is possible to believe it, and some people probably always will.The Conservative Right has been attacking Moore as a fraud and a hatemonger over this film, and in doing so I think they go at least one level too far. Moore is an angry partisan of the Liberal Far Left, but he has not come completely loose of his wrapping. The truely pathetic Pearl Harbor plot  - mongers believe that FDR ordered the base left defenseless specifically to incite an attack. A similar position is taken by the deranged idiots who maintain that the 9/11 planes were flown by CIA dupes. Moore does not go that far.For myself, as a reader of Von Clauswitz and Machiavelli, I would be greatly conforted if I believed that Bush had plotted to get us into the war on terror, and to justify the invasion of Iraq. Both are clear necessities of statesmanship, if we are to live in a world that is not run by thugs in dish towels. It is periodically necessary to remind the barbarians how unpleasant it can be to annoy their betters.

Bush and the fictious war in Iraq. Little did anyone know but Moore was also offering a teaser of his next film, Fahrenheit 9/11, a scathing attack on Bush, his link to the rich Saudi oil families, the ""War on Terror"" and the war currently raging in Iraq.Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Moore's documentary is that he puts a human face on the citizens of Iraq-something that the mainstream U.S. media has failed to do. He shows graphic footage of dead and maimed civilians killed by U.S. bombs and soldiers. He lets them speak and it becomes readily evident why many Iraqis hate America so much and why the mission to liberate them has so far failed. Moore also gives the U.S. soldiers a voice, interviewing several serving in Iraq and how some are clearly tired of fighting for people who don't want them there. Some soldiers who have come back home are also featured and they talk about their experiences and how their view of the war has changed. Moore also shows how the deaths of American soldiers have devastated their families with one woman in particular, Lila Lipscomb, whose story is quite compelling and resonates on a deeply emotional level.""Release of Fahrenheit 9/11"" is an 11-minute featurette on the film's reception at the Cannes Film Festival. There is also footage of long line-ups and sold out screenings as the film made its way through the country.""Eyewitness Account from Samarra, Iraq"" is an eyewitness account by Swedish journalist Urban Hamid on a U.S.-led raid in Samarra. There is incredible footage of U.S. soldiers arresting a man accused of funding insurgents that is narrated by Hamid himself.""Lila Lipscomb at Washington, D.C. Premiere"" features comments from the woman that Moore talked with in the documentary and whose son died in Iraq. She delivers an impassioned speech at the film's premiere.Finally, there are seven additional scenes of footage, including interviews with more average Iraqis on the streets of Baghdad on the eve of the 2003 U.S. invasion. Also included is more with Corporal Abdul Henderson and his experiences in Iraq and a very funny segment with Arab-American comedians doing routines about the ""War on Terror"" and how they are persecuted on a daily basis.Fahrenheit 9/11 is an incendiary zeitgeist movie that taps right into what is currently happening on our political landscape. It is an angry blast, a howling protest movie against a Presidency clearly out of touch with what is really going on.

The pattern is the same. Some very interesting facts and personal relationships which are normally obscured from the general public are brought to the forefront of our attention. Then, our host makes all sorts of cross connections between them to prove his pre-decided conclusions. Contrary evidence is ignored. Threadbare connections are given much more significance than they're due. Casual, incidental aquaintances are portrayed as tightly coordinated planners. Then, voila! You have a worldwide conspiracy out to dupe the public! Moore reminds us that the Religious Right don't have a monopoly on this sort of thinking. But there's a problem. You can't dismiss all of Moore's conclusions as paranoia. Some of them are true. But which, and how many? This is our puzzle. Moore brings up many facts that can't be ignored. They cry out to be connected. But which of these connections are valid? How much does it really fit together, and how much is wishful thinking? Moore does much of his connecting through emotional rhetoric and innuendo. Time and again, we must decide for ourselves how many of his links can be trusted. There's our task. As for the movie's over all style, it's typical Moore, which I happen to enjoy on a visceral level. He can still splice together very selective quotes and scenes to serve up a big helping of delicious irony. Many of his points are old liberal boilerplates. I don't need him to tell me that war is horrifically cruel to civilians, that the poor do the fighting and dieing, that certain groups and companies profit off war, and that W is a dimwit. And I certainly didn't need all those ugly extreme facial closeups. To show the Iraq war was unjustified, he uses the same arguments the anti-war people have been using for a year and a half. Not that they're wrong arguments. He just adds nothing new to the debate. The viewer's mind will not be changed after this. Still, all those facts .... It's time we sweep aside his implied connections and do our own connecting. There's still a chance he's right.

629827,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B00005JNEI,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[24, 39]","Michael Moore knocks down nine out of ten pins for the thought-provoking, humorous, and ultimately disturbing Fahrenheit 9/11, a title influenced from Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, the temperature at which books burn.  Well, this documentary is more a critique of the Bush presidency, beginning as it does with a prologue where Al Gore is poised to become the 43rd president, only to have victory snatched from him in Florida, and how Dubya became the winner of the most contested election since 1876.  What adds salt in the wound is how a series of minority representatives protested the ratification of Bush's election, only to be told to shut up by the president of the Senate, Gore himself!Indeed, what kind of president is one who when told of the World Trade Center, simply sits there for seven minutes reading My Pet Goat at a Florida elementary school?  Baaaa!  Or who says blatantly that is really helps having a father who's US president?  But what Moore presents is the dissonance between intelligence reports pre- and post-9/11.  In the former, a former acting FBI director tells a committee that Attorney General John Ashcroft did not want to hear anything about terrorist reports.  Saddam Hussein is also not considered a serious threat by National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice.  And afterwards?The GOP has been criticized for standing for Gas Oil and Petroleum, and Moore's showing the Bush family and the Saudi oil elite conjoined at the hip gives credence to that acronym.  Others tied in oil companies include Hamid Karzai, who became Afghanistan's first post-Taliban leader, formerly associated with Unocal 76,  Dick Cheney, ex-CEO of Halliburton, but there are others Moore has omitted.As for the effects in this country, much is made of the Fresno for Peace group, who had their group infiltrated, but he doesn't adequately cover the ramifications of the PATRIOT Act enough.  What comes clear from Representative John McDermott (D-WA) is how fear (the red, orange alerts) and uncertainty is used to control people.  In one clip, Bush jokes how a dictatorship would be easier!!!!!!Moore's use of pop songs as backing for certain scenes range from hilarious to chilling.  An example of the latter is Papa Bush smiling and exchanges greetings with the Saudi sheiks, when R.E.M. and Kate Pierson chime in with ""Shiny Happy People,"" or the Go-Go's ""Vacation"" in scenes of Junior on vacation in Texas.  Anger-inducing is the Playstation/XBOX mentality the young soldiers in tanks have, requiring a song mirroring the situation while in Iraq made me angry.  Examples:  Drowning Pool's ""Let The Bodies Hit The Floor"" and the Bloodhound Gang's ""Fire Water Burn,"" with key lyrics ""we don't need no water let the mf burn.""Which leads to the conduct of the war in Iraq.  The Iraqi people never committed acts of terrorism against Americans, and yet the civilians are the casualties in a war supposed to liberate them.  One angry and grieving Iraqi woman says there has been five funerals because of the bombing.  Indeed, Moore's narration uses the word ""invaded"" in regards to Iraq.  The footage of burned and injured Iraqis is disturbing and horrific.  Yet the onset of attacks against US soldiers lead the soldiers to wonder what they are doing here, clueless to the fact that the Iraqi civilians didn't ask for them.  One Corporal Henderson, he is willing to risk prison rather than return, and even helps Moore trying to persuade Congressmen to get their children to serve in Iraq.Which leads to the rich/poor division in this country.

The majority of the film, however, deals with the Bush/Saudi/bin Laden connections that may have complicated America's response to 9/11, the subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the backroom business deals that may have provoked both campaigns.FAHRENHEIT 9/11 does pull a couple of punches - Moore does not discuss Honduras' pullout from the ""Coalition of the Willing"" because of John Negroponte's appointment as Iraq's US ambassador, and he doesn't target the apparent complicity of American media as much as some may have wanted.  Other than that, Moore hits the target with surprising and devastating force (and some well-placed humor) every time.This is a sobering indictment of the George W.

This should tip you off that the film is mostly a montage of speculation and political rants with very little of what I would call journalistic substance behind it.I was disappointed by the film simply because it didn't do a good enough job. Taking cheap shots at Dubya may make those who hate him cheer, but it is not particularly compelling for those of us who might actually be trying to remain objective.This is basically the same stuff you'll find on Fox News or Rush Limbaugh, just spun in the other direction. Is that helpful?Post-election, this film loses much of its immediacy.  I agree that Dubya should be out of office, but I seriously doubt Moore's film will change many minds either way. If you already loathe Dubya, you'll love this film. If you support him, you'll end up hating Moore more!All the bomb throwing and conspiracy theory spinning reduce the power of his case, reducing it to a joke skit you might see on ""The Daily Show"" or ""Saturday Night Live."" On that level it is fun, but again it lacks ultimate substance, and Jon Stewart does it better!It cannot be denied that there is plenty of fact-twisting and spinning here. I also found that there were NO ""revelations"" for me. I already knew all of these rumors and theories just by being a well-read citizen.I can only imagine that an uninformed viewer might come away thinking that the Bushes are the most corrupt politicians ever. Folks, the whole political system is corrupt...both parties. Politics breeds strange bedfellows and there is a whole lot of adultery going on. It's what Alexander Hamilton claimed made the system work.Yes, millions of Americans are angry with George W. Bush, and rightly so.

Though this controversial documentary had a hard road making it to theaters, ""Farenheit 9/11"" has proved that Americans have had enough of the Dubyah Regime and are ready to move on (to the tune of 116 million dollars and counting!).  Bush and his far right conservative circle want to keep his ties to the Bin Laden family and to the Saudi's a secret but Moore and other's like him are determined, fortunately for the rest of us, to make sure that these truths see the light of day.  Republicans are gonna bash Moore for this direct hit on their moronic golden boy because they want to keep him in office four more years so the upper 1 percent of our country, the wealthiest, can continue to profit while the middle class shrinks to nothing and those at or below poverty level continue to grow.Moore, of course, is gonna be biased against this dictatorship, (whoops! I mean presidential administration), and opponents are quite willing to say he lies and creates propaganda against their beloved King George II in order to derail his bid for re-election.  Moore doesn't have to make up things or create propaganda for this film, Dubyah has given him more than enough ammunition---Bush has backed himself into a corner with his lies and outright deception on Iraq and our reasons for being there. Bush has done NOTHING to help our country, has only divided after a national tragedy should have brought us together and helped us stand together as a nation.  Bush has alienated us from the rest of the world although he gives us the impression that there are many nations behind us---a lie that Moore exposes with humor in the movie.The only thing I wish Moore would have touched on a bit more was Bush's use of the church and Christ as a banner he wears to, not only gain support for his ridiculous decisions, but also to explain his reasoning for making those decisions.  People I know vote for this man simply because he is anti-abortion and anti-same sex marriage----they give absolutely no regard to his complete annhilation of our relationship with the world community, the complete lack of interest in guarding our envirnoment and the blatant attack on our civil liberties and rights as American citizens.I'm proud to live in America and I am greatful that we are (for the time being) a country in which we can speak our minds without fear of harrassment or imprisonment.  America deserves a better president and our soldiers NEED a better Commander and Chief---one that won't send them into harm's way to suit his whims and his pathetic need to avenge his father's failure to catch a dictator a decade ago.  I hope that 9/11 is a film that will jolt American's awake from an apparent deep sleep that allowed this administration to steal our rights, send our young men and women to war without a real reason and give tax breaks that really didn't help any of us that really needed it.

Dein ""passafist""","[12, 20]","---Why do the Nations Rage, and the peoples plot in vain?----Psalm 2:1--Vanity of vanities, all is Vanity-Ecclesiastes 1:2The Psalmist's, biblical poets, did not grow up in 21st century. They didn't see growth of the war machine. They would have probably asked why were fighting over oil. They never witnessed 9/11. Yet they understood that every generation has been through the Horrors of war. In that situation I think they asked some of the same questions, that Michael Moore did in his new Documentary Fahrenheit 9/11. Of course the psalmist left us with a little more hope, ""Serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling...Blessed are all who take refuge in him."" Whether you accept that, at least the thought of taking refuge in a sovereign God is more comforting then what Moore, on the other hand, leaves us with. Wallowing in despair, unable to move. I've seen the movie and while I think it brilliant I'm at a loss from what I should gleam from it.In late 2000 it seems the election was stolen away from Al Gore by the Fox News Channel. It also seems the Democratic Party did nothing about it. Millions of voters, and local representatives were upset. But no senator's would lend their aid to the disenfranchised voters of Florida. Bush became president, he went on vacation, the economy went to crap and then while the world was viscously attacked, our country bumpkin leader sat with a bunch of kindergarten children and read a book about a happy goat.I sum up Moore's early moments with much scarsam. Because I consider myself a moderate republican. I think Clinton was corrupt, just like Reagan was corrupt, like Carter was corrupt, and so on. I like George Bush as a president; I even for the most part understand the war in Iraq. Do I think it was necessary? Well no. But I do understand that before 9/11 every Democrat would hold Iraq over the Republican Party as the unfinished war. I remember countless arguments with friends saying ""how come we didn't get Saddam out of power?"" Do I also think that in the long run, 20 years from now Iraq will be a in better place? Yes. Do I have my problems with the Bush administration? Absolutely, yes!After all those questions I guess your probably asking? Did you like the movie? I whole heartily did. Just like I liked Bowling for Columbine, Roger and Me, and even The Big One. Fahrenheit 9/11 is moving, brilliantly cut together, and Moore's narration is sharp. No matter what anybody has to say about this film, you can't argue that this movie is compelling. Even if it's one giant fabrication, or a giant piece of propaganda, which I myself am not about to agree with or disagree with. Fahrenheit 9/11 is a well made, powerfully moving film, and does what every documentary strives do, it gets people talking.The movie makes you laugh, It horrifies you, it makes you cry, and it stirs a sense of social justice that I think is vital in this day and age. Sure, I could probably write a book about the holes in Moore's logic (I'm still convinced some speech or debate class in high school should look at everyone of his movies and count the number of argumentative fallacy's he breaks) but on the merits of a movie, you can't argue with how well made it is.Michael Moore has always had a keen sense of social justice that I loved. He tries to look out for the little guy. Many of the people he talks to are composites of you and me. I loved the little old lady who talks about Halliburton near the middle of the film. That little old women is the voice of the masses I think. She doesn't have that many facts, but she sure is passionate with the scraps of knowledge she's gleamed from CNN or Katie Couric.My qualms with the film are three- fold. The biggest is Moore's shaky creditability. Lets face it, the guy has been making things up since Roger and Me. Every one of his films has walked the line from creative retelling to outright lie. It taints every idea in the film. It makes a moderate voice like mine very skeptical. Unfortunately I haven't done the research to oppose his ideas, but at least I can distance myself from them while I watch.My other problem is that Moore lays things on a bit too thick as the film progresses. Things go from bleak to worse, as an American I was grasping for something. Near the end of the film I just wanted a solution, a suggestion, even a small iota of hope. Moore presents us with such a bleak picture. He asks probing questions, but you're left feeling like ""what the heck can I do."" Except succumb to the fact that Michael Moore is better person that I am. This is why I like what Solomon wrote and the second quote above. In the end it's all vanity. It all passes away. One day were fighting Iraq, the next there are allies in our ongoing war with some other country that ticks us off. People are fallen and evil at their core. It's why we don't get along. It why we cheat and steal, and the greatest man can be the world our biggest enemy.Thirdly, was the way Moore portrayed Muslims. It seems the best way to get his point across that the Saudi's are bad is by placing ominous music over pictures of Bush and his father in photo-ops with men in turbins. He also uses silly silent movie clips to make the point that the coalition of nations is made up of the US and small inconsequatil countries with backwards ideas. While their may be truth in the comments, using broad stereotypes was not the smartest idea.All in all Michael Moore's Farenheit 9/11 is brilliant and bold. But will it sway voters? Probably not. This is a movie for those who agree with Moore, I don't think I will swing to many others. I would recommend anyone give it a try. You might just leave with a few ideas in your head and that's never a bad thing.***** Out of 5",5,Brilliant and Watchable,1089072000,"07 6, 2004",2004,5756,"['-Why', 'do', 'Nations', 'Rage',

629835,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,B00005JNEI,David Anderson,"[5, 9]","If anyone shall diss George W. Bush, this is the way to do it.  Michael Moore, one of the finest documentary filmmakers of today, produced, directed, and wrote ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", proving the truths of the last two years.  He takes his 2002 Oscar acceptance speech (Best Documentary Feature--""Bowling For Columbine""), which had some cheering fanaticly and some booing irately, into greater depths.  Few other filmmakers have dared to explore such subject matter.  This film has been highly praised by many critics and recommended by several celebrities including Madonna and Linda Ronstadt.This blunt, fearless filmmaker explores how this country and the military has been deceived by Bush, especially with the War In Iraq.  The featured documents, interviews, and archive film scenes help prove his point wonderfully.  Beyond that, he argues his subject matter beautifully.  The film starts with how Bush managed to slide into presidency in 2000, then shows his ""workmanship"".  Once the Twin Towers footage from 9/11 is featured, it begins growing into emotion and anger.  Moore brilliantly keeps audiences interested in every scene through his witty remarks, his interviews, and his personal reactions to every scene.  Through everything, he expresses his true compassion for this country, the people, and those highly affected by Bush's deception.This film features various celebrities: Britney Spears, Rick Martin, Ben Affleck, Stevie Wonder, and others.  The words of the politicians and the average US citizens also add to the personal film connection.  The various arguments prove various points that this country has.  This features how some have learned the true meaning of ""anti-war"".""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is a must-watch film for every citizen, especially before the upcoming election.  This proves the truths of what has happened.  Republican, democrat, independant, pro-war, or anti-war: many are sure to react emotionally to this subject matter.

629837,A1JH5J1KQAUBMP,B00005JNEI,David Bonesteel,"[17, 33]","What you think of this provocative documentary is bound to be colored by your opinion of Bush and the Iraq War.  In the interests of full disclosure, here's mine up front:  Bush is a failure as a president as well as a businessman; even if I approved of his domestic policy (which I don't), his hideous legacy in the Middle East, the consequences of which we will be dealing with for decades, would still tip the scales against him.That said, I enjoyed Michael Moore's expose, even though it is largely preaching to the choir in my case.  Beyond the extent of the links between the Bush clan and prominent Saudi business interests, there was little in this film that was new to me.  Although I basically agree with the points Moore makes, I recognize that he is often unfair in the way he juxtaposes images and uses his commentary to create context.  An example: Moore would have us believe that Bush might very well have been pondering the above-mentioned Saudi links while he sat stunned before Florida schoolchildren following the attacks on the Trade Center, although it seems doubtful to me that he had received enough information to make such connections.While ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" may not be as ""fair and balanced"" as the Fox News Channel (LOL), bear in mind that a documentary has no obligation to be.  Moore's film should be seen as a powerful polemic rather than dispassionate journalism; he cares deeply about his topic, and he is up front about where he stands on the issue.  Much of the criticism of him comes from anger and jealousy that he has touched upon a deep chord of anger toward Bush in this country by those on the right who are not above spinning facts themselves.",4,The 411 on 911,1098489600,"10 23, 2004",2004,1685,"['What', 'think', 'provocative', 'documentary', 'bound', 'be', 'colored', 'opinion', 'Bush', 'Iraq', 'War', 'interests', 'full', 'disclosure', 'here', 'mine', 'up', 'front', 'Bush', 'failure', 'president', 'as', 'well', 'businessman', 'even', 'approved', 'domestic', 'policy', 'do', ""n't"", 'hideous', 'legacy', 'Middle', 'East', 'consequences', 'will', 'be', 'dealing', 'decades', 'would', 'still', 'tip', 'scales', 'him.That', 'said', 'enjoyed', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'expose', 'even', 'largely', 'preaching', 'choir', 'case', 'extent', 'links', 'Bush', 'clan', 'prominent', 'Saudi', 'business', 'interests', 'was', 'little', 'film', 'was', 'new', 'basically', 'agree', 'points', 'Moore', 'recognize', 'often', 'unfair', 'way', 'images', 'commentary', 'create', 'context', 'example', 'Moore', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'Bush', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'pondering', 'above-mentioned', 'Saudi', 'links', 'sat', 'stunned', 'Florida', 'schoolchildren', 'following', 'attacks', 'Trade', 'Center', 'doubtful', 'had', 'received', 'enough', 'information', 'make', 'such', 'connections.While', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'fair', 'balanced', 'Fox', 'News', 'Channel', 'LOL', 'bear', 'mind', 'documentary', 'obligation', 'be', 'Moore', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'powerful', 'polemic', 'rather', 'dispassionate', 'journalism', 'deeply', 'topic', 'up', 'front', 'where', 'issue', 'Much', 'criticism', 'anger', 'jealousy', 'touched', 'deep', 'chord', 'anger', 'Bush', 'country', 'right', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'spinning', 'facts']",Fahrenheit 9/11

629839,AAE2DUEMTR30I,B00005JNEI,DAVID BRYSON,"[13, 20]","This film is partly documentary in the ordinary sense, but it stands to reason that the documentary elements serve a larger objective, which is to ridicule and demean the 43rd President of the United States. The film is `satire' basically, in the sense that the magazine Private Eye, which has a certain international distribution, is satire. Its modus operandi is basically to select and highlight whatever will show up its subject in the most unfavourable way, and to bolster its selections with a cartoon treatment of the principal actors in the drama. As the work of a committed opponent of this president and this war it doesn't attempt `balance', and I'm at a complete loss as to why anyone ever expected it to. One doesn't expect a prosecuting counsel to show balance, and Moore is an advocate making a case.It's also in the nature of the case that the more anyone investigates and thinks about political situations the more unedifying details turn up. This puts supporters of this particular war in an awkward bind, because sooner or later they have to explain what their standard terminology actually means. Supporting the troops, for instance, might mean wishing them a safe return. On the other hand it might also mean wanting them to continue doing what they're doing, and anyone advocating that can reasonably expect to be asked why. Similarly, fighting for one's country might mean defending it from attack. However it's hardly reasonable to condemn Iraqis for doing exactly that on their own soil, or for simply disagreeing with the proposition that the intruders know what's best for them. Stressing the positive aspects of the operation would be a quagmire too, as someone doing that is liable to come across as a complete lickspittle doing Moore's job for him even better than he's done it himself. The clip from the actress whose solution is not to think about the issue at all but to give unswerving and unquestioning loyalty seemed to me perfectly fair and to the point, as that is precisely what many are doing in practice. The usual attempts to hitch patriotism to this dismal outlook only highlight its uncomfortable suggestion of Goebbels.By the time this film was made I expect most thinking people had long made up their own minds about it all - and indeed most unthinking people including the actress who believes that thinking is a bad idea. There are probably not many converts to be made, but there will be some, and this film can only encourage people to use their brains, however reluctantly. In the main it will entertain those who share Moore's basic outlook and enrage those who don't, and I imagine that is the general idea. I had done my own analysis of the issue ages ago, but I was still startled by the revelation of just how little legislation the US Congress actually even reads. If the issue were, say, drainage in rural communities, that might be bad enough. When it turns out to have been true of the Patriot Act it seems to me that those who routinely identify liberty with everything their country does need to wake up. All in all, the film is not quite my idea of a 5-star effort but it's a very effective rehash of familiar arguments whether one feels it really justifies the hype that has attended it or not.",4,LAMPOON,1089676800,"07 13, 2004",2004,3259,"['film', 'partly', 'documentary', 'ordinary', 'sense', 'reason', 'documentary', 'elements', 'serve', 'larger', 'objective', 'ridicule', 'demean', '43rd', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'film', 'satire', 'basically', 'sense', 'magazine', 'Private', 'Eye', 'certain', 'international', 'distribution', 'satire', 'modus', 'operandi', 'basically', 'select', 'highlight', 'will', 'show', 'up', 'subject', 'most', 'unfavourable', 'way', 'bolster', 'selections', 'cartoon', 'treatment', 'principal', 'actors', 'drama', 'work', 'committed', 'opponent', 'president', 'war', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'balance', ""'m"", 'complete', 'loss', 'why', 'anyone', 'ever', 'expected', 'One', ""n't"", 'expect', 'prosecuting', 'counsel', 'show', 'balance', 'Moore', 'advocate', 'making', 'case.It', 'also', 'nature', 'case', 'more', 'anyone', 'investigates', 'thinks', 'political', 'situations', 'more', 'unedifying', 'details', 'turn', 'up', 'supporters', 'particular', 'war', 'awkward', 'bind', 'sooner', 'later', 'have', 'explain', 'what', 'standard', 'terminology', 'actually', 'Supporting', 'troops', 'instance', 'might', 'mean', 'wishing', 'safe', 'return', 'other', 'hand', 'might', 'also', 'mean', 'wanting', 'continue', 'doing', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'anyone', 'advocating', 'can', 'reasonably', 'expect', 'be', 'asked', 'why', 'Similarly', 'fighting', 'one', 'country', 'might', 'mean', 'defending', 'attack', 'However', 'hardly', 'reasonable', 'condemn', 'Iraqis', 'doing', 'exactly', 'own', 'soil', 'simply', 'disagreeing', 'proposition', 'intruders', 'know', 'what', 'best', 'Stressing', 'positive', 'aspects', 'operation', 'would', 'be', 'quagmire', 'too', 'someone', 'doing', 'liable', 'come', 'complete', 'lickspittle', 'doing', 'Moore', 'job', 'even', 'better', 'done', 'clip', 'actress', 'solution', 'not', 'think', 'issue', 'give', 'unswerving', 'unquestioning', 'loyalty', 'seemed', 'perfectly', 'fair', 'point', 'precisely', 'what', 'many', 'are', 'doing', 'practice', 'usual', 'attempts', 'hitch', 'patriotism', 'dismal', 'outlook', 'only', 'highlight', 'uncomfortable', 'suggestion', 'Goebbels.By', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'expect', 'most', 'thinking', 'people', 'had', 'long', 'made', 'up', 'own', 'minds', 'indeed', 'most', 'unthinking', 'people', 'including', 'actress', 'who', 'thinking', 'bad', 'idea', 'are', 'probably', 'not', 'many', 'converts', 'be', 'made', 'will', 'be', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'encourage', 'people', 'use', 'brains', 'however', 'reluctantly', 'main', 'will', 'entertain', 'who', 'share', 'Moore', 'basic', 'outlook', 'enrage', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'general', 'idea', 'had', 'done', 'own', 'analysis', 'issue', 'ago', 'was', 'still', 'startled', 'revelation', 'just', 'how', 'little', 'legislation', 'US', 'Congress', 'actually', 'even', 'reads', 'issue', 'were', 'say', 'drainage', 'rural', 'communities', 'might', 'be', 'bad', 'enough', 'When', 'out', 'have', 'been', 'true', 'Patriot', 'Act', 'who', 'routinely', 'identify', 'liberty', 'everything', 'country', 'need', 'wake', 'up', 'film', 'not', 'quite', 'idea', '5-star', 'effort', 'very', 'effective', 'rehash', 'familiar', 'arguments', 'one', 'feels', 'really', 'hype', 'attended', 'not']",Fahrenheit 9/11

That movie was so bad and so silly that it has actually become a classic. Before the election of 2004, I refused to see Fahrenheit 9/11. Since Fahrenheit 9/11 failed in it's objective to affect the election, it has sort of become a modern day ""Reefer Madness."" It is so ridiculous that it actually gets 3 stars for it's post election campiness value.

The editing makes it appear that they are victims of Bush's policy and that they are against the war. This is deception and some of these same people are reinterviewed in Dick Morris' ""Farenhype 9/11."" These reinterviewed people are furious that they were deceived by Moore. They say that the interviews were edited to give an entirely different intention than what was meant. They feel decieved, used, and hurt. The teacher of the school where the President was speaking during the events of 9/11 is interviewed in ""Farenhype."" Although a Democrat, she is grateful for the way that the President conducted himself in the school that day. Moore seems to think that he should have caused some sort of panic among the children.Moore takes footage of the 2000 Al Smith Dinner, held each year in New York, in which Bush self deprecatingly refers to the wealthy attendees as ""his base"" and makes it seem Bush is an admittedly big business president. In fact, Gore was also at this dinner and the purpose of an appearence there is to make a humorous speech. Almost all political figures make themselves the butts of their own jokes at this dinner. However, these distortions don't make me angry because Bush won.

629850,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00005JNEI,Dennis Littrell,"[27, 33]","I thought it was a little long.  Moore could have used an editor, but when you're the writer, director, and producer of a film--easily the largest-grossing documentary film in history--perhaps there is a reluctance on the part of anyone to cut the master's work.  And anyway, anyone could see that Moore wanted a little overkill to emphasis his various points: all those Sheiks of Arabi and glad-handed oil millionaires pressing flesh, all the George W. cowboy hats and little boy grins, all the dead and bleeding bodies, the limbless soldiers, the excited bombs a-bursting in surround sound--all the tragic absurdities of the spoiled little boy presidency--Moore knew--needed to be repeated over and over again lest the mass American mind miss the point.Okay, I have mixed feelings about this film.  It's not exactly a documentary--there is no pretense of objectivity, nor is it a full-blown burlesque of George W. Bush and everything that he is about--although it is close to that.  George W. appears often: swinging a golf club and asking us to admire his stroke; knitting his brows and allowing us to imagine that he is thinking; shaking hands with grinning Sheiks and oil-dipped Texas buds while petrol-dollars take to flight; and all the while the camera closes in; and then the sequences are repeated to comedic effect.But I think for sophisticated viewers, those who have been keeping tabs on Bush 43 for some time now, all of this is already known only too well.  Such viewers may find Moore's cinematic guidance a bit heavy-handed.  For such viewers this film may drag a bit in spots.I was thinking, too, while I watched all the shots of Bush II at play and pretend work and behind the podium practicing his oratory, that what Michael Moore really wanted to find is some footage of George W. at prayer.  If only the mendacious president could be caught kneeling before an altar or in a pew after the deed has been done, like Claudius in Shakespeare's Hamlet--how appropriate it would be.  A voice-over might exclaim: ""My words go up, but my thoughts remain below...""A nice bit was Moore's satirical attempt to stop congressmen on the street coming and going to work and get them to sign up their children and grandchildren for the Iraqi war.  Many chuckles there as our good representatives stare wide-eyed and/or flee in astonished horror.  How rude that gruff man with the microphone!I also liked (but found tedious and a bit obvious) the long drawn-out tale of the middle-American mother who identified herself as a conservative Democrat, a woman sure of the righteousness of American intent until it is HER son that comes up dead in Iraq.  And then she turns.  She sees, she understands: these are REAL people dying, getting blown up.  As she cries for her son, we the audience see the glorious ""precision bombing"" that so delighted Donald Rumsfeld mocked macabre by this personal tragedy.  Moore induces a nice clip of the Secretary of Defense waxing ecstatic on one of his favorite subjects (precision bombing).  And, although this is not emphasized, a substantial number of US injured and dead are the result of friendly fire gone awry.  Yes, she speaks too long and too self-indulgently, but in the end who can fault her or deny her feelings?One of Moore's more damning points and one that Bush and Buds cannot squirm out of is the government-sponsored exodus of the Bin Laden family and assorted Bin Laden family members safely out of this country immediately following the 9/11 attacks.  Why would the Bush administration make it such a top priority that such people be flown out the country?  Wouldn't it make more sense to keep them here, at least until they could be questioned?Overall one is left with the indelible impression that George W. is a child playing with the weapons of state of the most powerful country in the history of the world without the slightest awareness of their awesome effects.  He is a frat boy playing fighter pilot, mouthing empty cliches about ""mission accomplished,"" while all about him the real world of poverty and death go on unobserved and uncomprehended.",4,"A little long, but effective",1095206400,"09 15, 2004",2004,4112,"['thought', 'was', 'little', 'long', 'Moore', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'editor', 'when', ""'re"", 'writer', 'director', 'producer', 'film', 'easily', 'largest-grossing', 'documentary', 'film', 'history', 'perhaps', 'reluctance', 'part', 'anyone', 'cut', 'master', 'work', 'anyway', 'anyone', 'could', 'see', 'Moore', 'wanted', 'little', 'overkill', 'emphasis', 'various', 'points', 'Sheiks', 'Arabi', 'glad-handed', 'oil', 'millionaires', 'pressing', 'flesh', 'George', 'W.', 'cowboy', 'hats', 'little', 'boy', 'grins', 'dead', 'bleeding', 'bodies', 'limbless', 'soldiers', 'excited', 'bombs', 'a-bursting', 'surround', 'sound', 'tragic', 'absurdities', 'spoiled', 'little', 'boy', 'presidency', 'Moore', 'knew', 'needed', 'be', 'repeated', 'over', 'again', 'lest', 'mass', 'American', 'mind', 'miss', 'point.Okay', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'film', 'not', 'exactly', 'documentary', 'pretense', 'objectivity', 'full-blown', 'burlesque', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'everything', 'about', 'close', 'George', 'W.', 'often', 'swinging', 'golf', 'club', 'asking', 'admire', 'stroke', 'knitting', 'brows', 'allowing', 'imagine', 'thinking', 'shaking', 'hands', 'grinning', 'Sheiks', 'oil-dipped', 'Texas', 'buds', 'petrol-dollars', 'take', 'flight', 'camera', 'then', 'sequences', 'are', 'repeated', 'comedic', 'effect.But', 'think', 'sophisticated', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'keeping', 'tabs', 'Bush', '43', 'time', 'now', 'already', 'known', 'only', 'too', 'well', 'Such', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'Moore', 'cinematic', 'guidance', 'bit', 'heavy-handed', 'such', 'viewers', 'film', 'may', 'drag', 'bit', 'spots.I', 'was', 'thinking', 'too', 'watched', 'shots', 'Bush', 'II', 'play', 'pretend', 'work', 'podium', 'practicing', 'oratory', 'what', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'really', 'wanted', 'find', 'footage', 'George', 'W.', 'prayer', 'only', 'mendacious', 'president', 'could', 'be', 'caught', 'kneeling', 'altar', 'pew', 'deed', 'been', 'done', 'Claudius', 'Shakespeare', 'Hamlet', 'how', 'appropriate', 'would', 'be', 'voice-over', 'might', 'exclaim', 'words', 'go', 'up', 'thoughts', 'remain', 'nice', 'bit', 'was', 'Moore', 'satirical', 'attempt', 'stop', 'congressmen', 'street', 'coming', 'going', 'work', 'get', 'sign', 'up', 'children', 'grandchildren', 'Iraqi', 'war', 'Many', 'chuckles', 'there', 'good', 'representatives', 'stare', 'wide-eyed', 'and/or', 'flee', 'astonished', 'horror', 'How', 'rude', 'gruff', 'man', 'microphone', 'also', 'liked', 'found', 'tedious', 'bit', 'obvious', 'long', 'drawn-out', 'tale', 'middle-American', 'mother', 'who', 'identified', 'conservative', 'Democrat', 'woman', 'sure', 'righteousness', 'American', 'intent', 'HER', 'son', 'up', 'dead', 'Iraq', 'then', 'are', 'REAL', 'people', 'dying', 'getting', 'blown', 'up', 'son', 'audience', 'see', 'glorious', 'precision', 'bombing', 'so', 'delighted', 'Donald', 'Rumsfeld', 'mocked', 'macabre', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'Moore', 'nice', 'clip', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'waxing', 'ecstatic', 'one', 'favorite', 'subjects', 'precision', 'bombing', 'not', 'emphasized', 'substantial', 'number', 'US', 'injured', 'dead', 'are', 'result', 'friendly', 'fire', 'gone', 'awry', 'Yes', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'self-indulgently', 'end', 'who', 'can', 'fault', 'deny', 'feelings', 'One', 'Moore', 'more', 'damning', 'points', 'one', 'Bush', 'Buds', 'can', 'not', 'squirm', 'government-sponsored', 'exodus', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'family', 'assorted', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'family', 'members', 'safely', 'country', 'immediately', 'following', '9/11', 'attacks', 'Why', 'would', 'Bush', 'administration', 'make', 'such', 'top', 'priority', 'such', 'people', 'be', 'flown', 'out', 'country', 'Would', ""n't"", 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'keep', 'here', 'least', 'could', 'be', 'questioned', 'Overall', 'one', 'left', 'indelible', 'impression', 'George', 'W.', 'child', 'playing', 'weapons', 'state', 'most', 'powerful', 'country', 'history', 'world', 'slightest', 'awareness', 'awesome', 'effects', 'frat', 'boy', 'playing', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'mouthing', 'empty', 'cliches', 'mission', 'accomplished', 'real', 'world', 'poverty', 'death', 'go', 'unobserved', 'uncomprehended']",Fahrenheit 9/11
629851,A57Q87B0TC9IJ,B00005JNEI,Derek G,"[24, 41]","The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines propaganda as, ""ideas, facts, or allegations spread deliberately to further one's cause or to damage an opposing cause.""  Fahrenheit 9/11 most definitely fits the description of propaganda.  To Michael Moore's credit, he's been honest about his film having a bias and anyone with common sense would know this going in.Moore starts out with a recap of the Presidential election.  Among allegations of vote tampering, Moore cites ""numerous independent publications"" that claim Gore would have won had a recount been allowed in Florida.  Now, wait a second.  Just who are these ""independent publications?""  In the movie, Moore quickly scans over a few newspaper clippings but never elaborates.  In April of 2001, the Miami Herald and USA Today reported that, had a recount been allowed, Bush still would have won; in fact his margin would have widened.  A separate independent study done by the University of Chicago and financed by media giants such as the Associated Press, NY Times, CNN, and LA Times, (not exactly bastions of conservative reporting), came up with the same conclusion.Moore then jumps to the Senate hearing, presided by none other than Al Gore, to officially anoint Bush as the next President of the United States.  Election code states that in order for an objection to become official, a member of the House of Representatives needs to have their objection signed by just one Senate member.  One by one, house democrats parade their way up to the Senate floor to voice their objections, yet none were signed by a senator.  My question is -- why?  Where was Barbara Boxer during all this?  Where was Ted Kennedy?  Where were the democrats when they really needed them?This is one problem I have with Moore, and his movies in general.  It becomes very difficult to trust anything Moore says because he ignores the questions that don't support his agenda.  Watch the above segment carefully and you'll also see how Moore twists everything so that the hearing appears to be an attack directed specifically against African-Americans.  Moore also refuses to, as the old saying goes, ""let the facts get in the way of a good story.""Another example:  At the beginning and end of the movie, Moore holds up a copy of Bush's military records with the name James R. Bath blacked out.  Because Bath later managed money for the Bin Ladens, Moore insinuates that censoring his name is a kind of ""smoking gun"" that ties the Bush family to the Bin Ladens.  Perhaps, but that's kind of a stretch.  A more plausible and logical explanation could simply be that it was Bush's military records that were being investigated; not Bath's.That's not to say there isn't a lot to chew on in this picture.  Moore goes into great length to explain a possible tie-in between the Saudi Royal family and the Bush family.  From Bush Jr. being bailed out of his failed oil ventures by angel investors (James Bath via the Saudis) to Bush Sr. being on the board of The Carlyle Group (a large defense contractor and military arms dealer), Moore's claim that the Saudi investment of $1.4 billion dollars in the Bush family, their friends, and related business is enough to make one pause.  Considering the Saudis control 6-7% of the investments in the U.S., perhaps we should change our labels to, ""Made in America (but financed by Saudi Arabia.)""Continuing down the money trail, let's talk about Dick Cheney's testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee prior to 9/11.  ""You've directed me to buy the V-22, a program I don't need.  You've directed me to buy more M1's, F-14's, and F-16's... Congress has directed me to spend money on all kinds of things that are not related to defense, but mostly related to politics back home.""  Forget $1.4 billion dollars.  At a cost estimated at almost $1.4 trillion (with a `t') dollars over the next five years, money that could have been spent on democrat-favored programs like education and public infrastructure was instead spent on weapons the Pentagon never requested and didn't even want.  And who was President during this time?  Oh yeah, President Clinton.  And who controlled the purse-strings?  Oh that's right, a democrat-controlled Congress.  I guess that's why this footage never made it into the picture.This is the other problem I have with Fahrenheit 9/11.  In Moore's mind, or at least in this movie, George W. Bush is the root of all evil, and anything not meeting his criteria is left out.  Now maybe Bush did sell his soul to the Saudis for a billion dollars and the solution to the world's woes it to throw the bum out.  Unfortunately, there is nothing to suggest these same problems were going on long before Bush took office, or that anything will change for the better if this is done.I recommend Fahrenheit 9/11 for the issues it raises and the discussions it will generate, but its undeniably slanted viewpoint diminishes its persuasiveness.  It's a powerful movie, and its coverage of the Iraq war, the soldiers serving in Iraq, and parents of soldiers is truly heart-wrenching.  This is where the movie excels.  I just can't give the movie five stars because I left the theater feeling as if I needed to verify every allegation Moore makes, and it disturbs me that some people have bought into the anti-Bush rhetoric hook, line, and sinker.Not long ago, Canadian television aired an investigative report which claimed the moon landing was an elaborate hoax filmed by the late Stanley Kubrick.  Containing actual testimony from Kubrick's wife, as well as interviews of astronauts, scientists and even leaders like Henry Kissinger and Donald Rumsfeld, this ""mockumentary"" showed how easily images and media could be manipulated to deceive viewers in order to sell a particular viewpoint.  The same can be said about Fahrenheit 9/11.",3,Bowling for Bush in 2004,1088985600,"07 5, 2004",2004,5827,"['Merriam-Webster', 'dictionary', 'defines', 'propaganda', 'ideas', 'facts', 'allegations',

The film was a nice surprise. It uses plain language and very well selected scenes, it avoids the silly conspiracy theories, presents only the facts and gives voice to some of the US soldiers who served in Iraq. The most moving part of the film is the middle-aged woman who was very patriotic and proud of the US military and then suddenly lost the ground under her feet when her son was killed in Iraq.

However, one should watch these kind of opinion pieces with an absent mind and then form an opinion, as Mr. Moore does not ask the question ""what could be the ties of the Kennedys, Clintons and other politicians to also some 'sketchy' individuals or organizations?"".Nevertheless, this is a must see movie.

629858,A3EJYJC25OJVKK,B00005JNEI,"Distant Voyageur ""Nicholas Computer""","[12, 23]","I was already deeply depressed at the abhorrent behavior of my own country since our current administration was s(elected) into office. The attacks of September 11th were horrible enough for the destruction and loss of life that it caused. Our hero Michael Moore's follow-up to his controversial documentary ""Bowling For Columbine"" is the most powerful, not to mention the most awakening documentary that I've ever seen by anyone. (CAUTION: THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)Where the last one was focusing on our obsession with guns and trying to peer into the reason why America has such a high rate of gun violence, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is an outrageous and not to mention deeply frightening look at how Washington D.C. used the attacks of 9/11 to push it's own political agenda and the alliances between the Bush and The Bin Laden families and how dirty deals between the families caused Bush and Osama to become mortal enemies. We see many things where the ties between the oil companies that Bush and Cheney have played a significant part and the Saudi Arabian government officials and the many Bin Laden relatives who worked and lived in the United States and that the administration allowed to flee almost immediately after the attacks in NYC and D.C. You won't believe what this area will show to you. Be warned though: You will be very angry when you are done seeing this part wherever you lie on the political spectrum.I always was certain that the war in Iraq was motivated by our countries excessive thirst for petroleum and how Iraq is the world's second largest source of petroleum and that oil companies have been given contracts to rebuild the country for it's oil but this movie goes even farther and the things I saw just made me so incredible guilty especially for how our countries oil addiction has been one of the main causes of many of the wars we've fought in the Middle East. Being aware of this, I have chosen not to own a car just so I don't support Halliburton (The company that vice president Dick Cheney was head of) or other corporate creeps. The pictures of the many Iraqi children playing basketball, on playgrounds, laughing and reading with their parents and relatives immediately followed by the balls of fire and bombs going off and the aftermath made me cry in horror at the resulting suffering that has resulted from our administrations illegal war. Many of the Iraqi's even though they hated Saddam Hussein were infuriated at our countries unlawful attack against a country that had little if any capability to attack it's neighboring countries.Also a lot of things that really shocked and horrified me that this documentary showed was how the government would recruit soldiers for the war in Iraq, not from the well-to-do neighborhoods but would recruit them from a lot of the poor and ghetto neighborhoods like many areas in Flint, Michigan, Moore's hometown where his 1989 ""Roger and Me"" was filmed at, and many other run-down areas. Many of the poorer neighborhoods where the soldiers were recruited from, were made even poorer as a result of the administration's policies.I was always very scared of what has been happening in the political world but even then, this really shocked me and left me really teed off big time! Okay, maybe some of the things emphasized may or may not be exaggerated but this is the best example of why we need to wake up and realize what Washington is doing and how their dangerous and murderous policies are causing the deaths of thousands or even millions of lives and ruining countless millions more.""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is also smartly done and even goes the distance to take some swipes at the Democratic Party and how a lot of the members of that party really dropped the ball on the 2000 Election and that they just sat back and admitted defeat when they could easily have prevented the disaster that America has been both subjected to and causing to it's population and against other countries. This is sure to cause more controversy just like ""Bowling For Columbine"" did but this is one of the most honest and heartbreaking, not to mention powerful documentaries of all time and if you really do care for America and for the international community then you must see this right away because it will make you want to make a difference and try to make our world a much better place than it is now.While this is extremely serious in it's tone, there are parts of this documentary that are really funny and smartly incorporate humor into the movie to bring some laughs without taking away it's important tone. One part will make your stomach turn in three hundred and sixty turns.For all of those who are criticizing or bashing Moore for `liberal-propaganda' or dribble like that, do you even know what liberal or conservative mean? Neither liberal nor true conservative would've been waging this horrific war in Iraq, nor support frauds who have ruined so many lives and the future of so many more around the world. I for one am offended and appalled at the American attitude towards the international community and that seeing this documentary has made me realize just how low we as a nation have gone but that at the same time, we can turn this whole thing around and realize how our politicians have been screwing us over a hundred times due to their self-interest and murderous greed. I give my complete gratitude to Mr. Moore for helping to blow the whistle on the epic corruption of our leaders in Washington and for awakening us up to the dangers of them.Go and see this today! If you are a true patriot, then you must vote for new leaders who care for the people and not the special interests of greedy businessmen or oil companies.",5,Extremely important and

The problem is, people aren't watching this movie with an open mind and going to do further research on the issues presented, they are watching it through republican or democratic tinted lenses without looking at the very basic facts.

I mean, I've never been a big Michael Moore fan -- I'm still ticked off at him for backing Ralph Nader in the 2000 elections, and I think his reasoning is often overly simplistic and fuzzy-minded.  But I think this movie did an excellent job of making his leftie-pragmatic viewpoint accessible to mainstream America, and the information is presented in a very thoughtful, persuasive manner.  There are many, many things in this movie that I have simply not seen in the media before, or even heard about -- notably the squelching of Congressional dissent in the 2000 elections, a travesty presided over by Senate leader Al Gore, and some of the gut-wrenching footage from Iraq, which, amazingly, was fairly restrained, considering how much more, and much more gruesome footage must be available.  Anyway, I guess now I'm more grateful that Michael Moore is out there.  The current climate of trying to cut off all discussion and debate on issues of national disagreement, the my-way-or-the-highway attitude of the GOP media machine, is profoundly un-American, and if left unchecked may threaten the foundations of our very society.  (Debate and honest differnces of opinion makes us stronger and wiser, fellas!!)

After having seen it, I have little doubt that the media will hate it, and that politicians from both parties in power will villify it.The film starts off with questions surrounding the 2000 Presidential Election, particularly the media's refusal to question what had happened, and the refusal of Democrats in the Senate to even challenge the actions of the opposition, their own candidates, and the courts.The screen then goes to black, and you hear the sounds of the attacks on the World Trade Center.  You'll know what is happening without pictures, trust me.After that, Moore chronicals the events leading up to 9/11, the Administration's perceived lack of action and direction, and the events leading up to and including the war in Iraq.  Moore calls into question actions taken by the federal government to hinder investigations, help the bin Laden family, Saudi involvement in 9/11 and in the decision making processes of our own government, and so forth.Moore goes on to point out what he sees as the hypocrisy of politicians and the media.  He shows the recruiting tactics of military recruiters who leave wealthy neighborhoods alone while actively targeting poor and minority groups.  He shows the absurdity of media attempts to perpetuate fears, particularly when it benifits the current political leadership.Moore takes no prisoners, particularly amongst the media.  While many will interpret this film as ""a liberal attack"" on ""conservative values,"" the film really goes after the media as the main culprits behind what Moore sees as the failures of our current government and society.Love him or hate him, Moore is brilliant.

629862,A1JJ2ZUIKFHWBV,B00005JNEI,"D. Maisano ""Smart Person""","[6, 16]","Let's clear up a few things with this movie. Does Moore have an agenda? Of course he does. His agenda is to get Bush out of office. Is the movie one-sided? Yes, as the Bush administration is not seen in any sort of positive light in the movie. Is the movie therefore devoid of any political and educational value? Not in the least. Moore and Miramax have stated on numerous occassions that the facts of this film were checked, re-checked, and checked again, and it shows. In theory, you could save your money and just find archives of all the stories that contributed to the facts of this movie. There are also important interviews with former FBI and congressional members in the film as well.Even if you are a die-hard conservative/Bush supporter who feels that Moore's views are without merit, fine. Lord knows conservatives aren't the most open-minded people. However,  you can't ignore the FACTS that are presented in this film, nor can you ignore the footage of the soldiers and Iraqis that are shown here. The casualties of this war are even greater than the fatalities, as you will see soldiers missing limbs and suffering permanent physical/mental damage from the war, which is the kind of stuff the major news outlets seem reluctant to show.Talking about the media, if you wonder why every news station is making their own ""Does Fahrenheit's Facts Check Out?"" segment, its not because they really have evidence of false facts, but rather they're just covering their own butts because the media is shown in quite a negative light in this film, especially Fox News. They're covering up shoddy reporting by attacking Moore (anyone who saw Matt Lauer's interview with Moore can attest to that.)This film is more aimed towards people who really don't know about what's going on in our government. I brought my friend who's never been political about anything to see this and he was appalled when he learned what was going on. To be fair, anyone who sees this movie needs to realize that this is still just one side of the story, and should not base all of their political thinking on it. Still, knowledge is truly power, and the power attained from seeing this movie is very real and tangible. And for all those nay-sayers who say that the film is full of lies, all I have to say is: Prove it. Don't just say, ""The film isn't entirely accurate,"" give me pure EXAMPLES of how this is so. It should be noted that all of these sorts of criticisms have been disproven by Moore, including a high profile one in Newsweek. I'd highly recommend that you go to Moore's web site to learn more.In conclusion, this film is a scathing view of the current administration, and these views are ""justified"" via facts/interviews/information throughout the movie. Not everything is cut and dry in it, but it definately leaves you with something to talk about. I recommend everyone see this movie, and to bring all your friends/family as well. And don't give me the excuse that ""I don't care about the government"" or ""This film will just make me cry/angry."" Just because you ignore these issues does NOT mean they are simply going to go away. You owe it to yourself as a citizen to know what it is the government is doing on your behalf. Remember, our government, and especially our President, are our representatives to the rest of the world. We elect them to represent us, so you owe it to yourself to check that they are faithfully representing you, so that you can make the decision in November whether or not to keep them in office or to kick them out.

That's the watchword for a documentary filmmaker, even one as publically visible as Michael Moore.  Yes, we all know the guy's political agenda, we all know he hates George W. Bush like summer hates the winter, but if Moore is to be taken seriously he has to establish objective credibility that is compelling and believable and not agenda-driven.  Plus, a ""documentary"" is supposed to present BOTH sides of a controversial issue, so that the viewer may make up his or her mind.  Not so with FAHRENHEIT 9/11, which I had predisposed myself to be a muck of warbling nonsense prior to viewing, yet even I could not comprehend its blatant hatred and vitriol.  In the wake of the deadliest attack on U.S. soil I was shocked, concerned, and disturbed that Mr. Moore would decide to kick a political football of diviseness. . .plus put one or two bucks in his pocket, just for jollies.Don't get me wrong:  George W. Bush is the worst President to reside in the Oval Office since Warren G. Harding (and that's saying something).  I am NOT some politically expedient apologist who enjoys hammering leftists for the sake of hammering; I just call 'em as I see 'em, and Moore dropped a stink bomb here.  Yet, I think I know something about journalism, as I graduated with a degree in it, and I can tell those of you reading these words that Moore has systematically and enthusiastically raped all tenets of objective and unbiased reporting that those of us who labored under the guise of reporting strove mightily to obey.  This piece of sludge isn't a documentary; it's a piece of disingenous propaganda that usurps common decency.  This is flagrant. . .flagrant. . .sensationalism; the very fact Moore tries to paint a Bush/bin Laden connection without flushing out ALL the facts reeks of moral corruption and ineptitude even more telling than Moore's bashing of Shrub.(And by the way, Michael:  You aren't that funny, either.)But heck:  If someone wants to show me that the devastating attacks of 9/11 were the by-products of a corrupt administration in bed with oil-producing countries in the Middle East--a corruption intent on ""looking the other way"" to protect its billionaire buddies--well, I'm all ears.  Show me the money.  But Michael Moore can't:  He's too busy spinning his hatred and personal vendetta against George W. Bush.

When I looked at those films, I wondered what was wrong with the Germans who went along with such atrocities.Watching this movie made me feel guilty that our country had done so much harm to innocent people around the world in our apparently misguided efforts to locate Saudi-Arabian led Al Qaeda terrorists.  Now I wonder what's wrong with me for allowing this to happen.I hope you will look at the movie and make your own judgment about what each of us needs to do.  I know that I need to begin to speak out and write against the self-serving nonsense that we are being fed from Washington, D.C.

I had read that book, too, and expected few surprises at the movie.  But Mr. Moore has updated his research and information quite a lot since the book was written.  What he added really floored me.As I read in the New York Times this morning that a military draft reinstatement is just around the corner, I realized that unless we stop our attacks on other countries and our search for oil and military profits we will doom hundreds of thousands of other young people to go through what just happened in Iraq . . . as well as millions of innocent civilians around the world.Let's start acting like Americans again.

Michael Moore attacks with video and film footage on the history of the Bush family and its ties with the Saudi family. Michael Moore starts with the senior Bush and then goes after President Bush by using suggestive ties between the Saudis and Bush families.The director tries to use film clips with commentary to convince the viewer that President George W. Bush is guilty by association and corrupted by oil money. Greed from the highest position in the land is thrown into convincing fashion by film and research facts. Can this hold up in a court of law? Probably not! I'm sure this film would be part of the evidence collected to bring down President George W. Bush if it was brought up in a court of law.The director would have us believe that President Bush is not American by his ties with the Saudis. I believe the true purpose of this film is to bring down the current President Bush's regime and vanish the Bush name to corruption. Michael Moore does have some balls to take on the President Bush though. Its one thing to take on the NRA, but the highest and most powerful person in the world!Only in American can a film director take on the most powerful leader in the world and get away with it. I believe if all of this was true of the Bush family with its billions and billions of dollars at stake in oil and secrecy held in trust, that President Bush or his family keeps it a secret by using his so called influence. Maybe a disappearing act!  Would the Bushes let a documentary film director film and distribute a film with all this bashing of the family name? If this was true!With the majority of the media already under the influence of political parties, can a blatant attack on President George W. Bush by a filmmaker be crushed before it was made? Of course it could. Maybe the political hype and influence in film was underestimated by the Bush family as comes with the territory. Can a film bring down a presidency? We shall see!

The film represents a milestone for the liberal media and has created a stir which may ultimately effect how people, including Americans, view our Democracy.The movie as a whole isn't nearly as spectacular as the effects it will have. Some of the points are reinforced by examples which seem to have been grasped on a stretch. Moore could have made a much better case against the Patriot Act considering all of the fine examples of its abuse by the American government. Moore could have also mitigated his point, while still leaving it in, about the plane which left the U.S on September 13 carrying the Bin Ladens. Although this was a suspicious action Richard Clarke has clearly shown that it was not a decision made by Bush or his immediate circles.The thesis of the movie is well delivered and supported: These young soldiers, representing mostly the bottom strata of our society, are being sent to Iraq to fight a war that has little to do with the reasons given to fight it. These young people are dying for nothing. They are merely security guards for the huge corporations which seek to benefit from Iraq's resources. The war in Iraq is immoral and represents a huge blemish in the United States' record as a ""leader of the free world.""Weighing in all of the positives and negatives, I would still say this is a movie which every American should see, regardless of their opinions going into it.I tip my hat to Michael Moore.",4,The Power of One Movie..,1088380800,"06 28, 2004",2004,1526,"['Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'powerful', 'movie', 'potential', 'change', 'American', 'consciousness', 'film', 'milestone', 'liberal', 'media', 'created', 'stir', 'may', 'ultimately', 'effect', 'how', 'people', 'including', 'Americans', 'view', 'Democracy.The', 'movie', 'whole', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'spectacular', 'effects', 'will', 'have', 'points', 'are', 'reinforced', 'examples', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'grasped', 'stretch', 'Moore', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'case', 'Patriot', 'Act', 'considering', 'fine', 'examples', 'abuse', 'American', 'government', 'Moore', 'could', 'have', 'also', 'mitigated', 'point', 'still', 'leaving', 'plane', 'left', 'U.S', 'September', '13', 'carrying', 'Bin', 'Ladens', 'was', 'suspicious', 'action', 'Richard', 'Clarke', 'clearly', 'shown', 'was', 'not', 'decision', 'made', 'Bush', 'immediate', 'circles.The', 'thesis', 'movie', 'well', 'delivered', 'supported', 'young', 'soldiers', 'representing', 'mostly', 'bottom', 'strata', 'society', 'are', 'being', 'sent', 'Iraq', 'fight', 'war', 'little', 'do', 'reasons', 'given', 'fight', 'young', 'people', 'are', 'dying', 'nothing', 'are', 'merely', 'security', 'guards', 'huge', 'corporations', 'seek', 'benefit', 'Iraq', 'resources', 'war', 'Iraq', 'immoral', 'huge', 'blemish', 'United', 'States', 'record', 'leader', 'free', 'world', 'Weighing', 'positives', 'negatives', 'would', 'still', 'say', 'movie', 'American', 'should', 'see', 'regardless', 'opinions', 'going', 'it.I', 'tip', 'hat', 'Michael', 'Moore']",Fahrenheit 9/11

This is the film that has had citizens of the United States, France and other nations debating, discussing and deliberating.  While some see it as a true example of freedom of speech, and following the old addage that ""the truth shall set you free,"" others see it as a perpetuation of subversion, disrespect and even anti-patriotism, at the hands of the filmmaker and writer, Michael Moore.This is the first of Moore's documentaries that I have seen, and I hope to see more.  His unique blend of ironic narration, juxtaposed with presidential footage, a supercharged soundtrack (interlaced with a combination of rock & roll and standards), and chilling figures and documents, backing up his belief that the whole ""War on Terror"" was one of the hugest,deadliest, coldest and most expensive tricks pulled on the American people, to date.  According to Moore, not only was the 9/11 tragedy a set-up, from the get-go, but due to the political and professional ties the Bush family had with the Bin Laden family, our soldiers were sent to start a war with a group of innocent people, in a country that had nothing to do with the terrorism, or the deaths of thousands of innocent casualties in the Twin Towers, that fateful day of September 11, 2001.This film is enough to make anyone opposed to this war very, very angry at our government, the grand manipulators who played with our heads (through media coverage, as an example), and even at ourselves for falling for this cruel joke, devised by politicians who only bow to the almighty dollar.  Moore captures the tone of this anger very effectively, yet, I didn't find it one-sided, subversive or even particularly radical.  I just felt I was being presented with the facts that were coveted for so long, and that I was finally given a glimpse into a reality (more like ""surreality"") that many of us may have suspected, but few of us were able to prove.  I felt that Moore's interviews with people in support of the war were not manipulations.  He listened respectfully to Lila Lipscomb, mother of one of the soldiers, with respect and also with tolerance.  What's more, he doesn't let us forget that the young people fighting on the frontlines are just as human, real and have just as much dignity as those who are vehemently opposed to the bloodshed and heartlessness of violence.Masterfully done, Michael.  This is definitely one of those films that will stand the test of time.  It is truly a time capsule that transcends the generations.

Carlson,"[15, 33]","From an apodictic point of view, i.e. from a point of view that is free of biases and outside of history, however unlikely the attaining of this state is, this work should not be called a documentary. No references are given for its claims, although the checking of the truth of these references may be very time consuming. As an example of this, the attempt by Moore to connect Karzai to Unocal is not substantiated. It would be very easy to give references to substantiate this claim, but he does not.But from this (apodictic) viewpoint, however fanciful it might be, one can make judgments as to the authenticity of the content of F/911. In that sense F/911 could be viewed as providing motivation to perhaps produce a work that would either substantiate or nullify the claims made in F/911. Such reactionary works have already appeared, and have various degrees of quality, if judged from this (perhaps fanciful) apodictic point of view.Such a point of view (again, however fanciful) would permit one to make judgments as to the ""best"" or ""worst"" parts of F/911.  The best part of this work is the attempt by Moore to challenge Senators and House members to sign up their children for Iraq. This of course will not happen. Their sons and daughters do not sign up for combat. That wealthy people do not fight their own battles is an axiom of history. The worst part of the movie is the interview with a few U.S. troops, whose attitudes about offensive operations are presented as representing the majority of the troops stationed in Iraq. In the heat of battle, it is very understandable that they would need emotional props such as hard-rock music to get them through it.When viewing this part of the movie, one naturally wonders what Bush would do in such circumstances. His seven minutes of silence and inaction in the Florida classroom, as portrayed in this movie, instill skepticism in his ability to think decisively, independently, and rationally in situations of stress. One thing is sure, Bush has never had to face the intense emotions of war that these soldiers did. Bush has never had to say goodbye to his wife and children and then march to war. Bush has never had to make on-the-fly decisions in the horrific situations of combat. Bush has never had to bury a loved one killed in war. Bush has never been in a situation where death is constantly tugging at his elbow. This goes for Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, and others in his cadre of yellow abdomens.It would also be incorrect to call this movie ""propaganda"", as this is a term that should be reserved to societies whose governments are oligarchies or dictatorships. It is more appropriate in a democratic or pseudo-democratic society to form a new category or framework to characterize works such as these. This new category might be called ""political aesthetics"", and would be a branch of aesthetics, for, like art, it sometimes provokes strong emotions in the observer and spawns possibly many new genres. In addition, it can require both detachment and involvement to appreciate it fully. Some works of art require, for their appreciation, that individuals detach themselves from their feelings and prejudices, and in many instances view these works from an ahistorical point of view. Conversely, an appreciation of art sometimes requires deep personal involvement, and requires that one ignore external criticism and the opinions of others. In both cases, one cannot speak of the ""truth"" of these works of art. One can only speak of appreciating them. The most important point to remember here is that art can be sloppy as well as ordered, it can induce delight as well as pain, and it can instill respect as well as disgust. This work (of art) is no different than any other.Without extensive research and statistical sampling, it would be difficult to say whether this movie will influence the decisions this Tuesday.

The movie has some good parts.  The most moving parts for me were when he was interviewing the woman whos son died over in Iraq.  I think the reason that this was the best part of the movie was because it couldn't be argued, it was one woman's opinion and presented as such.  It was very moving.  Some of the parts were borderline ridiculous, like when it showed the kids playing with their kites in Iraq before we invaded it.  I think it is safe to say that Iraq was not some sort of utopia as it appeared to be in this scene before we invaded.  Another unfair part of the movie was when Michael Moore asked the politicians in DC to sign up their kids to go to war.  I think he should focus more on whether or not the actual politician was in the military, as it is certainly not the parents' decision to send their kid to war in most cases.  Some of the connections with the Saudi family might not be outright lies and Moore has sources for them, but its definately not a well-proven, matter-of-fact idea as this movie presented it.That said, I wish Michael Moore wasn't the hero of the Left in this country as he apparently is.  I think the reason that he has become so popular is because the Left needs something to cling onto because the Right has so many figures like Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, FOX NEWS.  The Left needs some form of propaganda for people too lazy to read a book or listen to the radio to find out what is actually happening.  If the Left's hero were some other figure such as Eric Alterman or even Al Franken, I think that we would be a lot better off; the reason they aren't is because since they deal with more real issues and more real information many people find them boring.  While clearly biased, at least they deal with facts and more objective information than emotional appeal.  That being said, I guess it is better to have Michael Moore than no one to present propaganda for us.Don't get me wrong, I'm a Liberal Democrat and agree with Moore that Bush needs to go, but I don't think that this movie is fair.

Like any skilled doctor needing to share a real diagnosis that no one wants to hear, he knew early on--from the days of ROGER AND ME--that the architects of the free market system that is slowly destroying democracy in America had far too much power over the media and interrelated institutions for his message to truly be heard any other way. This now near-iconic celebrity persona of his is what people of opposing viewpoints often debate about--forgetting, if actually ever knowing, that it is manufactured for one specifically noble purpose: get the truth OUT; out of the stale, impotent, universities; off the shelves of the dissident bookstores; out of the hands of the corpoarate leaders who know it will save lives and whole cultures but adversely affect their bottom line. In other words, getting the truth out of the hands of the spineless, useless and moral-less, and into the hands of everyday regular people, without whom the world would not even exist, let alone come to an end.In other words, do not make the mistake the marketplace has been hoping you'd make of confusing the messenger with the message. I saw this movie in the theatres with my teenage children months ago and it is still affecting my entire family. Hardcore Republican friends of mine who were also in the theatre were more dumbstruck and silent than I was.If there has ever been a little voice in your head that has questioned the inconsistencies of the very concept of terrorism as it has been defined by our current politicians; wondered why the search for Osama bin Laden and the war in Afghanistan--a country full of almost nothing but oil trade routes and the poorest people on earth--has somehow fallen off the radar screen with the (pre-planned) rise of Iraq; wondered if the manufactured image of our political leaders is what is actually guiding your support or refutation of their influence above and beyond their actual records of ""service""--and to what they have  actually been serving...if there is any part of your soul still clinging to life in this soul killing quasi-fascist state our beloved country seems to be falling toward, you will find a CPR for the mind, body and soul the likes of which you never experienced before in life with this movie.Michael Moore and FARENHEIT 9-11 have had a multitude of detractors for some time now. But I have yet to hear anyone, literally anyone, refer to the actual facts consistently proven and re-proven when they condemn him. Facts that have been purposely and consistently ignored by the corporate media in the evening news and daily papers--even in the context of their reviews of the movie, its unprecedented success as a documentary, or irrational personal attacks against him. Even the most intelligent and patriotic people on the opposite side of the fence revert to screaming children when critiquing this movie, totally ignoring the movie as a whole, or the most vivid and damaging of the facts within.The facts that make up this powerful and frightening documentary are too disturbing to be taken lightly. And yet the courage and artistry it takes to actually present these facts in an entertaining and informative way as Moore does is nothing short of astounding.Agree with it. Disagree with it. Call him names. Praise his name. Love him. Hate him. Just forget what you think about Michael Moore the person and see this movie, if you have ever once said you love this country. This movie is an absolute masterpiece--and undoubtedly the most important movie of any kind made in the past twenty years.

Not because it was the greatest documentary ever, or that it was the most accurate: I liked it because it showed how free we really are in this country. We can call the president of our country a stupid liar and subtly play the guitar riff from ""Cocaine"" in the background while Mr. Moore's narrative spoke of what G.W. Bush was doing during the seventies. There are many nations where this would have gotten Mr. Moore into a great bit of trouble.I think Mr. Moore's methods are relatively sound in that he shoots from the hip and aims for the heart. Was everything in this movie 100 percent accurate? No. Was this a piece of propaganda? Yes. But at the same time it was propaganda, it dared to ask questions that not many people in the media are prepared to ask. Is the war in Iraq just? Was there another way out? Is everything being done to keep our troops safe? What is the real cost of the war?There were some amazingly powerful moments in Fahrenheit 9/11. Lila Lipscomb, the mother of an American Soldier who died in Iraq , reading her son's last letter to her. Lipscomb herself was the person who encouraged her son to join the military. Also very powerful was Mr. Moore's showing of the similarities between his run-down hometown of Flint Michigan and comparing them to pictures of post-battle/bomb Iraq.There were many parts in this film that I thought were appalling, but more than the rampant corruption in the government (which is almost par for the course these days. .) were the lies that the Marine recruiters told the people they encountered. Telling a sixteen year old that the Marines could set him up with a career in music, or getting complete contact information from on boy so they could ""take [him] off our list"" is simply wrong. That is sick. That in itself sets in people's mind, from the start, that these are people who should not be trusted, and that is not an example of the integrity that has been a beacon of the Armed Forces.My only real complaint in this is the fact that many people see everything Michael Moore does as truth and not a hyperbolic representation of the facts. There are even more, who lean toward the right, who see him as a liberal poster-child of anyone left of center. I know this in not Mr. Moore's intention, but it is a side-effect.In my mind, this movie accomplished some things. It showed that people who are liberal still love the United States . A consistent theme in the wake of September 11, 2001 was that people who question the government are traitors and that most of those who did the questioning were liberal.

629883,A2UCOSEHTW6I0H,B00005JNEI,Eddie Konczal,"[18, 27]","""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is one of those films, like Michael Moore's earlier ""Bowling for Columbine"" and Oliver Stone's ""JFK,"" that polarizes audiences along political lines.  If you like George W. Bush, chances are you'll hate ""Fahrenheit 9/11;"" if you can't stand Bush, you'll probably love it.  There's little room for middle ground in today's sharply divided American electorate.Many critics of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" claim the film is factually inaccurate. However, very few details of the film have actually been refuted. What really angers many about this film is its premise: that Bush ignored the threat of terror before the tragedy of September 11, 2001, and then used the attacks as an excuse to advance a radical right-wing agenda that included an ill-advised invasion of Iraq (which had no involvement in the September 11 bombings).Not exactly a cut-and-dried documentary, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is more of an essay film that relies on documentary footage to underscore Moore's hypothesis.  The footage and facts are expertly woven into a devastating indictment of Bush's policies.  You may disagree with the way Moore connects the dots, but his evidence does come from the public record (including actual quotes from Bush and his administration).For all the political weight it carries, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is entertaining as heck.  Most of the comedy occurs in the film's first half.  There are montages of Bush vacationing to (you guessed it) the Go-Go's ""Vacation"" and of Bush Sr. schmoozing with Saudis to REM's ""Shiny Happy People.""  Moore examines the ""Coalition of the Willing,"" finding that our allies include ""superpowers"" like Pulau, The Netherlands, and Costa Rica. (My favorite line: ""Afghanistan? ...Oh, yeah. They had an army. OUR army!"") Moore also milks the Patriot Act for laughs, hijacking an ice cream truck to announce its provisions to members of Congress (who admit they didn't actually read it).As events draw nearer to the invasion of Iraq, the tone grows darker, and Moore gradually dispenses with humour in order to focus on the story of military mother Lila Lipscomb, whose son goes to serve in the war.  Moore's delicate, sensitive handling of Lipscomb's heartbreaking story belies his reputation for guerilla filmmaking.Near the end of the film, Moore offers this profound observation about our troops: ""They serve so that we don't have to. They offer to give up their lives so that we can be free. It is, remarkably, their gift to us. And all they ask for in return is that we never send them into harm's way unless it is absolutely necessary. Will they ever trust us again?""  Unfortunately, conservatives refused to address this and other valid questions raised by ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", instead focusing on discrediting Moore himself.  They must have felt vindicated when Bush narrowly won reelection in 2004.  But the election results do not invalidate the hypothesis of Moore's film.  Rather, as our troops remain in Iraq, as American casualties mount, and as Bush's rationale for war fades into obscurity, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" remains all too relevant.",5,Burning Bush,1114905600,"05 1, 2005",2005,3075,"['9/11', 'one', 'films', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'earlier', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'JFK', 'audiences', 'along', 'political', 'lines', 'like', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'chances', 'are', ""'ll"", 'hate', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Bush', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'love', 'little', 'room', 'middle', 'ground', 'today', 'sharply', 'divided', 'American', 'electorate.Many', 'critics', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'claim', 'film', 'factually', 'inaccurate', 'However', 'very', 'few', 'details', 'film', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'refuted', 'What', 'really', 'many', 'film', 'premise', 'Bush', 'ignored', 'threat', 'terror', 'tragedy', 'September', '11', '2001', 'then', 'used', 'attacks', 'excuse', 'advance', 'radical', 'right-wing', 'agenda', 'included', 'ill-advised', 'invasion', 'Iraq', 'had', 'involvement', 'September', '11', 'bombings', '.Not', 'exactly', 'cut-and-dried', 'documentary', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'more', 'essay', 'film', 'documentary', 'footage', 'underscore', 'Moore', 'hypothesis', 'footage', 'facts', 'are', 'expertly', 'woven', 'devastating', 'indictment', 'Bush', 'policies', 'may', 'disagree', 'way', 'Moore', 'dots', 'evidence', 'come', 'public', 'record', 'including', 'actual', 'quotes', 'Bush', 'administration', 'political', 'weight', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'entertaining', 'heck', 'Most', 'comedy', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'are', 'montages', 'Bush', 'vacationing', 'guessed', 'Go-Go', 'Vacation', 'Bush', 'Sr.', 'schmoozing', 'Saudis', 'REM', 'Shiny', 'Happy', 'People', 'Moore', 'Coalition', 'Willing', 'finding', 'allies', 'include', 'superpowers', 'Pulau', 'Netherlands', 'Costa', 'Rica', 'favorite', 'line', 'Afghanistan', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'had', 'army', 'army', 'Moore', 'also', 'Patriot', 'Act', 'laughs', 'hijacking', 'ice', 'cream', 'truck', 'announce', 'provisions', 'members', 'Congress', 'who', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'read', 'events', 'draw', 'nearer', 'invasion', 'Iraq', 'tone', 'darker', 'Moore', 'gradually', 'humour', 'order', 'focus', 'story', 'military', 'mother', 'Lila', 'Lipscomb', 'son', 'serve', 'war', 'Moore', 'delicate', 'sensitive', 'handling', 'Lipscomb', 'heartbreaking', 'story', 'belies', 'reputation', 'guerilla', 'filmmaking.Near', 'end', 'film', 'Moore', 'profound', 'observation', 'troops', 'serve', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'offer', 'give', 'up', 'lives', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'free', 'remarkably', 'gift', 'ask', 'return', 'never', 'send', 'harm', 'way', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'Will', 'ever', 'trust', 'again', 'Unfortunately', 'conservatives', 'refused', 'address', 'other', 'valid', 'questions', 'raised', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'instead', 'focusing', 'discrediting', 'Moore', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'vindicated', 'when', 'Bush', 'narrowly', 'won', 'reelection', '2004', 'election', 'results', 'do', 'not', 'invalidate', 'hypothesis', 'Moore', 'film', 'Rather', 'troops', 'remain', 'Iraq', 'American', 'casualties', 'mount', 'Bush', 'rationale', 'war', 'fades', 'obscurity', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'too', 'relevant']",Fahrenheit 9/11
629884,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JNEI,Ed Uyeshima,"[23, 31]","Political activist Michael Moore has certainly honed his craft as a documentary filmmaker and concurrently raised a firestorm of extreme feelings about the Bush administration. Since receiving boos at last year's Academy Awards ceremony for calling Bush a ""fictitious President"" who was leading us to a ""fictitious war"", he has fast become a touchstone not only for the agitated left but for all those who have felt increasingly alienated by the imperial hubris of the current administration. Whether you like this film or vehemently hate it will depend far less on the quality of the filmmaking (which by the way, is excellent) as it does on how you plan to vote in November's election. Ignore this film at your own risk, as it is a powerful indictment creatively executed. Better to view it and discuss its implications, as it won't go away thanks to Moore's constant and savvy media campaign. He was fully aware of the coming firestorm and given his history, I'm sure he welcomes it as his agenda leaves no room for historical context or an analysis of facts or debate. It's a brilliant blame game and frankly quite a convincing one at that. As a filmmaker, Moore has become far less didactic than he was with ""Roger and Me"" or even ""Bowling for Columbine"". Instead, he has become an almost subtle alarmist and a first-rate filmmaker.Mercifully, Moore is far less visible in this documentary as his first-person rantings and attempts at ridicule can get tiresome even if the treatment was deserved. The one exception is his admittedly humorous attempt at the end of the film to get U.S. Congressmen to enlist their children for Iraq on their way to work. Otherwise, his presence is felt in the calm yet pointed narration. The film starts with a compelling argument for the illegitimacy of Bush's election. This was actually the most revealing sequence, as we go beyond the chad controversy into all the odd connections and situations that appeared jerry-rigged to ensure Bush's victory. I dare anyone to watch this part and justify not voting in the next election. Moore then goes into the murky, under-the-table relationship between the Bush and the bin Laden clans before he became President, especially the suspicious way the FBI decided to fly the entire American side of the bin Laden family out of the U.S. two days after 9/11 without holding any of them for questioning. Whether his conjecture about the triangulation among the Saudis, the Bushes and oil is true or not, it has credibility in the way it is presented. This sequence catapults us into the grim reality of war, showing dying Americans and Iraqis, and speaking with a few of the thousands of casualties at U.S. hospitals who feel betrayed. There is a shocking sequence that follows a Christmas eve interrogation of a seemingly unsuspicious Iraqi family, as well as another one with U.S. troops ridiculing hooded detainees near Samara (sadly paralleling the humiliations that occurred at Abu Ghraib).  Finally, Moore does bring the conflict home with a sadness quite familiar to anyone with recollections of Vietnam, when the heretofore devoted military supporter Lila Lipscomb reads a letter from her son who was killed in Iraq, noting: ""He got us here for nothing whatsoever."" It is probably the most predictable moment in the film but also its most personal.What resonates most in the film are images most of us never got to see on the news, like the series of African-American congressional members being turned away for their pleas of invalidating the Florida election results; or Marine recruiters manipulating small-town, low-income teens in Flint; or most infamous, the time-lapsed seven minutes as a slightly perturbed Bush reads ""The Pet Goat"" in front of a Florida kindergarten class. Praise or vilify Michael Moore, but it is difficult to deny that much of what he does claim is at minimum strangely coincidental and at worst immoral. A perfect example in the film is the passing of the U.S. Patriot Act, where at least some of the material in the USA Patriot Act had nothing to do with 9/11, and instead involved long-sought items on the FBI agenda which had previously been unable to pass Congress, but which were enacted by Congress under Bush administration assurances that they were essential to fighting terrorism. It is hard to stomach that kind of logic.Moore has grown significantly since ""Roger and Me"" in 1989 and not just around the waistline. Believe it or not, this is not the most damning film that he has done, just the most publicized and certainly the best timed in light of the upcoming Presidential election. Moore places less emphasis on espousing his opinions this time around and more on facts, figures, quotes and actual footage from real events that actually make the viewers decide for themselves. The film is not perfect, not nearly, but it is important viewing. My recommendation is to see this film, then read John O'Neill's grudge-laden ""Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry"" and see which one you find least objectionable to lead the country.",4,"Master Provocateur Ups His Game, Reaps Dividends",1094256000,"09 4, 2004",2004,5088,"['Political', 'activist', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'certainly', 'honed', 'craft', 'documentary',

629885,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,B00005JNEI,Edwin C. Pauzer,"[37, 47]","Five things struck me about this film that have stayed with me:1) President Bush's almost sphinx-like reaction to the news of the terrorist attack on 09/11;2) his weekend at the ranch clearing brush appearing as the common man's man while ignoring the August 6th memo that announced al-Qaeda was going to attempt an attack against the United States using airplanes;3) telling reporters (and forgive me, if I don't have it completely right) ""I think it's important that we all fight against terrorism."" Then, he segues to ""Now watch this shot."" as he steps up to the tee.4) the mother who lost her son in Iraq;5) The military targeting the poor for recruiting.The first image of President Bush in the classroom gives him the appearance of a clueless Captain Queeg who simply does not know what to do. That is not how I want our leader to react in a time of imminent crisis.The second image of our president at his ranch where he has spent 40% of his presidency suggests that the August 6th memo was not given its proper attention. No matter what spin neo con talk show radio hacks may want to say about Clinton, no one can seriously say that this president did not have the information to do something, to take some action other than standing in front of his pick-up and clear brush. As a reminder of how clueless this administration was, Condoleeza Rice was still promoting an upgraded nuclear ballistic missile system, and the attorney general, John Ashcroft placed terrorism under drug interdiction on his priority tree. That's how clueless these people were.The president talking about getting everyone to fight terrorism and then blithely segueing into, ""Now watch this shot,"" suggests that his prior comments were almost reflexive and insincere. It isn't appropriate to say, ""Now watch this shot!"" right after discussing terrorism.While filming the mother who lost a son in Iraq may seem to be a cheap shot at gaining sympathy, it does send another important message: this mother and other Americans who speak out against the war are patriots, far more so than the people who attempt to brand them as traitors.Moore makes an excellent point here about how the poor are so actively recruited for the military while congress keeps their sons and daughters out of harm's way, but are quite willing to send the children of others into harm's way. This is a very old tradition. The president was even the beneficiary of it, receiving a direct commission he did not have to earn, and being jumped over 600 other personnel waiting on the list for the Texas Air National Guard.I gave this only four stars because Spinsanity was able to find a number of misdirections and false impressions under Michael Moore's direction.Nevertheless, this is an important film worth seeing or purchasing.P.S.

Well:1. Flawed. Michael Moore throws a lot of stuff out onto the carpet that is suggestive, but doesn't go anywhere, like the stuff about the Saudi royals (""Bandar Bush"", anybody?).2. Powerful. You will laugh. You will cry. If you saw it in the theater, you'll know what I'm talking about. I left at the end of the movie emotionally drained and mad as hell about George W. Bush and his misrule of America.3. Powerful. Did I mention that it's powerful?In the end, despite this movie's well-publicized flaws, I have to call it what it is: A must-see experience, especially in this election season, where you need to see this movie even if you are a Bush supporter.

It also peers into the strong influence of the Saudi government and it's awful human rights record and it's cozy relationship with the Bush dynasty and it's oil companies.Some of things I saw ranged from outrageous and horrifying to some being laughably funny especially with how low the officials in Washington really are. One especially made me want to barf in a paper jet bag.I am really ticked off at the 'liberal-bashing' that I have seen here. As a previous reviewer somewhere pointed out, Do you even know what either liberal or conservative mean??!!!! In all honesty, people should never label someone as a 'liberal' or 'conservative' because the truth is is that people I believe are a mix of both political perspectives. I am offended at all of this 'liberals suck' garbage coming from every direction and I am appalled at how low we have come. Liberal and Conservative are NOT black and white!!!!!!!This is a must-see film.

You either love Michael Moore's work or you don't. I think it is safe enough to say that ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" polarized both the liberals and conservatives. If anything learned from the controversy over ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" and ""The Passion of the Christ"", there are three conversation topics that makes people's blood boil it has to be: 1) abortion, 2) religion, and 3) politics. Michael Moore's political film really succeeded in pissing off a lot of people. I first saw ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" when it first opened in the summer. I loved it. I thought it was far more entertaining than ""Bowling For Columbine"" (although I do love that film). I think it is funny that people think this film is propaganda. Maybe it is but I honestly don't care, I found the film both hilarious and engaging. I had my opinions on the current political climate long before ""Fahrenheit 9/11"". This movie didn't change anything for me. My biggest gripe about ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is that Michael Moore makes too many innuendos (not that they weren't hilarious which they were)about the current administration therefore sounded like a thirteen year old taunting another kid on the playground instead of an adult, very childish, if not immature at times. Still I couldn't help but laugh at his innuendos. When the film shifted into a more serious tone with the war in Iraq and Lila Lipscomb, I thought that is the film's strength. Michael let the soldiers and Lila tell their side of the story. Watching ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" reminded me how powerful this film was, especially when the film opened up with just the sounds of people running away from the World Trade Towers on 9/11. My favorite moment in the film has to be when Michael Moore borrows an ice cream truck and drives around Capital Hill reading out loud the Patriot Act because the senators and congressmen (allegedly) never bothered reading the Patriot Act. That really floored me. I also thought it was rather prophetic of Michael to try to enlist the children of various politicians who have all voted for the war in Iraq. The dvd bonus features were just as compelling. I especially was interested in what the Arab-American comedians had to say, particularly after the terrorist attacks on 9/11. I also enjoyed watching the footage where the producer and camera crew went to before and (allegedly) after the war in Iraq. Overall I loved ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" and I refuse to apologize for the fact that I love this film. Did it really change my opinions on the current political climate?

629894,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B00005JNEI,Erik North,"[6, 11]","Michael Moore is the pre-eminent cinematic muckraker of our time, hands down.  And now, with FAHRENHEIT 9/11, he has outdone himself by leaps and bounds.This film is as infuriating and provocative as any film that has ever been made, documentary or otherwise, in history.  With sometimes satirical narration by the man himself, we get a glimpse at the administration of George W. Bush, from the 2000 Florida election debacle to post-9/11 hysteria and the invasion of Iraq that has cost the lives of close to one thousand of our soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians so far.  The Bush/Bin Laden connections; Dick Cheney's Haliburton past; the complicity of the news media in rallying support around this war, particularly with respect to Fox News; the passage of the now-venal so-called ""Patriot Act"" without a single objection in either house of Congress--all of these things and more are bought out in savage detail.  For me, the most troubling and disturbing moment in FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is the sequence in which Bush is reading to kids in the school in Florida at the moment one of his aides tells him of the collapse of the second World Trade Center tower--and we look at his glassy stare.  Some have merely chalked it up to showing a brave face on Bush's part; others chalk it up to his supposed ineptness.  I didn't feel either way, though.  I could see the wheels turning in his mind--that with the World Trade Center now nothing but a seven-story pile of rubble, he had been given the perfect excuse to launch a war.It is very easy for Bush's supporters to say this film and its creator are both unpatriotic, that it is slanted so far to the left that it isn't even worth the time to comment.  But from the opening moments of the Iraq war, those same supporters, with the complicit help of right-wingers like the Fox News Channel and blowhards like Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, and Rush Limbaugh have shoved plenty of their own propoganda down the throats of the American people under the guise of patriotism, freedom, and democracy.  And NONE OF THEM has EVER served in combat.  Not one.  But they have no problem sending poor or working-class kids over there to get killed for a slogan.  Those are questions Moore is asking and demanding straightforward answers to, and that's what makes him a true patriot.  His film merely serves to balance the scales, and if it means turning the far right's apple cart totally over, then so be it.  This is what America is all about.However one feels about Bush or America or Michael Moore himself, FAHRENHEIT 9/11 demands to be seen at least once.  It demands us to ask of ourselves how we got to where we are now, and how we can get back on track to make this nation of ours great once more.  Any film that can ask the tough questions and provoke such a firestorm of response is, for me personally, a masterpiece of the highest order.

Along the way we learn that our country is bankrolled by Saudis, El Shrubbo snorted lines and went AWOL after dodging combat in Vietnam (a perfect role model for his freeper following), and most importantly, many people can be cowed by fear and nationalism into going along with anything someone with an Austrian or Texan accent tells them.

I think most mature American voters are quite capable of discounting the spin and addressing the issues raised, which are important ones; the movie may or may not influence their votes. I found much of what was shown extremely interesting and worth looking for more information about. Other parts of the film I discounted as hyperbole resulting from a passion against a certain political viewpoint.But, although the film does have its own slant, it has never been claimed to be more than one man's view of events; it should be understood as such. And any critic who says that in this free country a person expressing a different political view from his own is a traitor has a very distorted view of what the United States is supposed to be about. Mr. Moore has put forward his entry into the &quot;free marketplace of ideas.&quot; People of different views have done the same, and some of them also have opinions of interest. Truly, it is possible for people of honor to be loyal and well-intentioned, yet still to hold different ideas about the policies that would govern this country best. People on each side are entitled to try to win others over to their viewpoints. Personally, I liked the film very much. If some people didn't--hey, free country, right?

As a non-American, who has always been impressed by the degree to which America defends its rights, I am amazed. HOW CAN AMERICANS ACCEPT THIS? It gives the impression that they are spending their lives asleep.What Michal Moore has assembled in this film is a unique collage of perspectives regarding contemporary Amercian history and politics. Some have called it demagoguery, I think it would be more aptly called an expos&eacute;. Moore supports his claims with such eye-popping, authentic documents, that people lean forward in their cinema seats to examine them, almost in disbelief and even when Moore has already projected them at a high level of magnification.Take for example one of Bush's war record documents. Moore not only has the unclassified copy, but he also exhibits the classified one. Another eye popper is the official list of Saudi nationals who are secretly transported out of the States on September 13th, a day on which all flights were supposed to have been grounded. This is confirmed by a government official. Another document illustrates a business deal in which a Bush family member is financially involved with a bin Laden family member.Not one to go half way, Moore has candy not only for the eyes.Often through the film, I notced the audience was dead silent. People were concentrating mightily on what was being said. One example is a large business meeting where a fellow with a thick accent tells a room full of businessmen that there is lots and lots of money to be made from this war.It's not unusual for wars to provide boosts to economies, but the eager, almost hand rubbing look of contractors moving in to profit from blood and destruction explains much better than Moore can in his own words, the reason why so much attention has been and is being focused on Iraq: it is the #2 oil producer in the world.While documents and interviews make good support for documentary, Michael Moore does not settle for soundbites alone. Several powerful interviews are revisited through the film and American soldiers give some astonishing insights but the most poignant message in this film comes from an interview with the mother, Lila Lipscombe, of a recently kiiled American soldier. (I'm embarrassed and sorry I'm can't exaclty recall what his first name is.). Whether we're hearing her, or her husband speak we still get the same impression: these are good, decent, back bone of America people who simply want to know why the killing is necessary, and who sympathize and empathize with the suffering and grieving of others.You might  form different opinions about Michael Moore, but when it comes to this family you cant help but do one thing: share their pain.What I came to realize after watching this film is the difference between Michael Moore and George Bush. Bush believes that people who criticize him are criticizing America while Michael Moore knows that criticism of Bush has nothing to do with the Office of the President or the American people, it is simply a democratic response to Bush's policies and actions, which in Moore's mind are dubious.The most important notion expressed in this film comes at its close. Moore states, over an enigmatic image that, in our world,  there is a specific, entrenched socio-political structure that exists and the only way we are going to make progress as a society is to overcome our ignorance and engage in democracy as responsible citizens. That's not the exact wording, but thats what I took from it.I strongly urge you to see it and consider his assertions. There are the occasional cornysend-up, along with harrowing war footage, the likes of which CNN seems loathe to broadcast. Yet ultimately, Moore's story is an authentic American one, that does not belong to him, but is being told through him and in his style. A tapestry that is part parody, part imitation of popular American culture, and part plain narrative.It is to Moore's credit that the film is effective not simply as pop entertainment that tugs regularly at emotions, but also as a tragedy in which we are all implicated. Even before I left this film, I felt quite a gamut of emotions, one of them being shame for my lack of action to try and stop this invasion during which so many civilians needlessly suffered or died, and during which much of the country has been razed.My impression by the end of the film is that the country of Iraq has been reduced to ruins, like a wrongfully  convicted criminal , as the jackals have moved in to pave the way for its exploitation.",5,The new standard,1088208000,"06 26, 2004",2004,4661,"['were', 'many', 'reasons', 'why', 'America', 'needed', 'film', 'Farenheit', '9/11', 'did',

If this film carried a fraction the weight of Moore himself it would be a substantial film indeed.""There is no terrorist threat!"" That is a direct quote from Michael Moore. I swear I am not making that up!!! I have seen him on TV saying those exact words; if you have doubts check out his biography on the IMDB. They credit that quote to him as well. To be fair, I don't know whether he said that before or after 9/11 but it really dosen't matter. Either way it shows a profound disconnection with reality, and you can be sure that this film is entirely colored with the same type of rhetoric. Here is another typical Moore quote. ""The Iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not 'insurgents' or 'terrorists' or 'The Enemy.' They are the Revolution, the Minutemen, and their numbers will grow, and they will win.'' Its almost impossible to believe he actually said that. If stupidity was a sport he would be olympic champion. They are not insurgents or terrorists? Let me tell you, if I were a terrorist and I had to pick my campaign manager, Moore would be my first choice. These quotes don't have anything to do with the movie in and of themselves, but you need to see what Michael Moore really believes to put the film into some sort of context.What Moore is doing in this film is nothing new and its really very simple. His film uses tricks that date back even before the great Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl. Moore is merely using clever editing and movie magic to completely manipulate the truth. Moore has theories but no facts to back them up; so what does he do? He goes out and completely fabricates the facts. What you as the viewer has to decide is: Do I care that Moore gets his point across, even if it's in a dishonest way? I personally don't like to be lied to; you may feel differently though.Jean-Luc Godard the famous filmmaker and founding member of the French new wave said of Moore: ""Post-war filmmakers gave us the documentary, Rob Reiner gave us the mockumentary and Moore initiated a third genre, the crockumentary."" I didn't say that; a French filmmaker did. Now if a Frenchman (they are generally very anti-war/Bush) can see through the lies of this film, it shouldn't be a problem for any American to do the same.Don't get me wrong, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is a pack of boldface lies and manipulations but if you watch carefully you will see upon closer inspection that Michael Moore is, in fact, enormously fat.This film is cleverly edited for sure; you have to give Moore credit for that.

And with similar contempt have been treated most of those in the minority opposing/questioning the War in Iraq. All these were taking place while the official politicians and mainstream media were going along.Now that Mr. More set out to give a fuller version of his position, people from several quarters are quick to hold him at higher standards than the current executive has ever been subject to. The saddest part, as Mr. Moore concedes, is that while such treatment is understandable from career politicians it becomes way out of place when coming from the anchors in the official (oops, I meant mainstream) media. Indeed, one can only shriek at the viciousness with which the likes of Matt Lauer &CO; are attacking &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; and, worse yet, Mr. Moore himself.Anyway, coming to the Fahrenheit 9/11, pity on those who needed Mr. Moore's movie to open their eyes to what has happened for all this time. Pity for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it should have been the jobs of the elected (and not only aspiring) political opposition and the mainstream media to question this administration's rationale for going to war. Secondly, Moore does only a partial and somehow biased job--and there is plenty of reasonable critique addressing this at Amazon.com --at untangling the reasons for the war. Overplaying the emotional card with the poor Flint MI mother or somehow justifying the War on presidential family ties or oil interests seems a little myopic/naive. As a film-maker, Moore passes; As a historian/documentarian he fails; As a pamphleteer he passes with flying colors! Henceforth, the four star rating.Now, I would like to pose to you, the reader, the following question: How will Moore's movie change the political debate in this country? For it is clear that taking things out of context of what has been the &quot;civil&quot; bounds and using them with an electoral goal may poison for good the future political debate. Indeed, if the non-written agreement around transmissible material is broken, as in the case of Mr. Wolfowitz's licking his comb or Mr. Bush's driving a golf ball, the hell may break loose. In any event, nothing prevents the current administration's backers from bankrolling a similar project directed at their political opponents. So, is this yet another first step in an arms race whose result has not necessarily been more responsive/responsible politicians? Then, as consequence, the cynics or the uninvolved citizenry may well fall back on the same arguments, &quot;they all do it, it's all a scam anyway,&quot; for not making the most of the wonderful democratic machine at work in America. Let's only hope that the most effect of Mr. Moore's movie will be indeed the mobilization to vote of the 50% segment of uninvolved citizenry.As a side note, there is no need to bring back the memory of Mr. Clinton for his consciousness cannot be all clear after Rwanda, Bosnia, Kosovo, Sudan, etc. In Mr. Clinton's defense one can only invoke &quot;it was the economy stupid!&quot; and not the litany of relative and partial metrics.As a second side note, here's Mr. Moore's acceptance speech: &quot;Whoa. On behalf of our producers Kathleen Glynn and Michael Donovan from Canada, I'd like to thank the Academy for this. I have invited my fellow documentary nominees on the stage with us, and we would like to - they're here in solidarity with me because we like nonfiction. We like nonfiction and we live in fictitious times. We live in the time where we have fictitious election results that elects a fictitious president. We live in a time where we have a man sending us to war for fictitious reasons. Whether it's the fictition of duct tape or fictition of orange alerts we are against this war, Mr. Bush. Shame on you, Mr. Bush, shame on you. And any time you got the Pope and the Dixie Chicks against you, your time is up. Thank you very much.&quot;To sum it all up, beyond laughter or despair, this movie should mark a moment of sobriety about the current and future states of the affairs of the realm. Provided that the electorate and the politicians do their jobs, (on November and in Congressional Comissions/Committees, respectively), Fahrenheit 9/11 will remain just a talented pamphleteer's opus and not some bad omen for things to come.

629904,AJWDOCM9BLAQ3,B00005JNEI,Fernando,"[58, 79]","From the reviews I've read so far it's obvious to see how polarized views on this film -and current American discourse for that matter- are. Yet it is hard to talk about it without revealing one's own feelings about the war.Overall the film was well done, both in content and structure. And contrary to what the reviews written here by the right-wing sympathizers  (consisting usually of one paragraph and saying nothing substantive about the movie-just ad hominem attacks against Moore) there are no lies in this movie. Moore himself has said he thought about offering $10,000 to anyone who finds anything factually wrong in it, yet some in the right love to bash it. Ironic, since the reasons this administration used for taking the US to war have been proven inaccurate -to say the least-, but the ""Party of Self-Responsibility"" does not seem to admit to them. I'm willing to bet that most of these reviewers who give the movie one star have not even watched it.What the movie contains however, is a string of selective facts that Moore can be very manipulative in using. A good example is the footage of Iraqi civilians on the eve of the war; children flying kites, happy families,  followed by... the attacks. This is followed by scenes of mayhem and death, and one particularly heartbreaking scene of a bloody baby wailing while being carried to a hospital (that scene still haunts me). This was an undeniable part of the war, this really happened, and Moore elicits from the audience the response he intended. Yet as I watched this, I thought that if instead of those scenes he had chosen footage of Saddam'storture houses, children being tortured in front of their parents, wives being raped in front of their husbands and children, then the response to the bombing from the audience would have been a very different one. This was part of the war too.Further, while I believe there was foul play in the 2000 elections, I would not go as far as Moore. And seriously, can anyone say with a straight face that the last name Bush HAD NOTHING TO DO with the Supreme Court ruling in favor of junior? Yet Moore builds up this case in a way that makes it seem as a watertight conspiracy theory, when in reality it was many people, at many levels of government, putting aside objectivity and integrity and ruling out on partisan allegiance, not unlike a struggling democracy elsewhere. Moore does show an amazing amount of papers and concrete proof to base his argument on, but again, one is left feeling that it could not be so ""perfect"" as Moore would have you believe.The documentary does articulate the outrage of many people who feel we were taken to war for dubious reasons, and then it turned out that those reasons were downright wrong. Right now American credibility around the world is zero, and half the people in this country feel the same way about the Bush administration. Moore's intention with this movie is to keep Bush for winning office again, which is in my view a necessary step for our own survival and to signal the rest of the world that this country does not approve of the lies we have been fed. If re-elected, we will be seen as co-conspirators and American reputation will sink even deeper. Although this reader needs no convincing, Moore's film makes the case even more persuasive.In the end if Michael Moore hates America or not only he must know; but raising a mirror to America's face is probably the most patriotic you can do right now.Fahrenheit 9/11 ends with a thought that should be given nothing but respect and approval from the audience; ""Our young men and women put themselves on the line and ask that we only put them in harm's way when absolutely necessary."" How some people can say they agree while at the same time still support what Bush has done -all evidence against him- is to live a contradiction. Yes, Saddam Hussein was the scum of the earth and his sons and cronies were no better, but this was not our war to fight. If the reasons for taking us to war were to ""bring the gift of freedom from the Almighty"" to Iraq or oil or strategic security or whatever, accusations of WMDs and imaginary links to al quaeda do not justify it. That the people who did everything possible not to serve in uniform when it was their duty, are the ones who now so carelessly take us to war, is nothing less than a tragedy.",4,Worth Watching,1093737600,"08 29, 2004",2004,4355,"['reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'so', 'far', 'obvious', 'see', 'how', 'polarized', 'views', 'film', '-and', 'current', 'American', 'discourse', 'matter-', 'are', 'hard', 'talk', 'revealing', 'one', 'own', 'feelings', 'war.Overall', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'content', 'structure', 'contrary', 'what', 'reviews', 'written', 'here', 'right-wing', 'sympathizers', 'consisting', 'usually', 'one', 'paragraph', 'saying', 'nothing', 'substantive', 'movie-just', 'ad', 'hominem', 'attacks', 'Moore', 'are', 'lies', 'movie', 'Moore', 'said', 'thought', 'offering', '10,000', 'anyone', 'who', 'anything', 'factually', 'wrong', 'yet', 'right', 'love', 'bash', 'Ironic', 'reasons', 'administration', 'used', 'taking', 'US', 'war', 'have', 'been', 'proven', 'inaccurate', '-to', 'say', 'least-', 'Party', 'Self-Responsibility', 'not', 'seem', 'admit', ""'m"", 'willing', 'bet', 'most', 'reviewers', 'who', 'give', 'movie', 'one', 'star', 'have', 'not', 'even', 'watched', 'movie', 'however', 'string', 'selective', 'facts', 'Moore', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'manipulative', 'using', 'good', 'example', 'footage', 'Iraqi', 'civilians', 'eve', 'war', 'children', 'flying', 'kites', 'happy', 'families', 'followed', 'attacks', 'followed', 'scenes', 'mayhem', 'death', 'one', 'particularly', 'heartbreaking', 'scene', 'bloody', 'baby', 'wailing', 'being', 'carried', 'hospital', 'scene', 'still', 'was', 'undeniable', 'part', 'war', 'really', 'happened', 'Moore', 'elicits', 'audience', 'response', 'intended', 'watched', 'thought', 'instead', 'scenes', 'had', 'chosen', 'footage', ""Saddam'storture"", 'houses', 'children', 'being', 'tortured', 'front', 'parents', 'wives', 'being', 'raped', 'front', 'husbands', 'children', 'then', 'response', 'bombing', 'audience', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'different', 'one', 'was', 'part', 'war', 'too.Further', 'believe', 'was', 'foul', 'play', '2000', 'elections', 'would', 'not', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'Moore', 'seriously', 'can', 'anyone', 'say', 'straight', 'face', 'last', 'name', 'Bush', 'HAD', 'NOTHING', 'TO', 'DO', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'ruling', 'favor', 'junior', 'Moore', 'up', 'case', 'way', 'seem', 'watertight', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'when', 'reality', 'was', 'many', 'people', 'many', 'levels', 'government', 'putting', 'aside', 'objectivity', 'integrity', 'ruling', 'out', 'partisan', 'allegiance', 'not', 'struggling', 'democracy', 'elsewhere', 'Moore', 'show', 'amazing', 'amount', 'papers', 'concrete', 'proof', 'base', 'argument', 'again', 'one', 'left', 'feeling', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'perfect', 'Moore', 'would', 'have', 'believe.The', 'documentary', 'articulate', 'outrage', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'feel', 'were', 'taken', 'war', 'dubious', 'reasons', 'then', 'turned', 'out', 'reasons', 'were', 'downright', 'wrong', 'Right', 'now', 'American', 'credibility', 'world', 'zero', 'people', 'country', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'Bush', 'administration', 'Moore', 'intention', 'movie', 'keep', 'Bush', 'winning', 'office', 'again', 'view', 'necessary', 'step', 'own', 'survival', 'signal', 'rest', 'world', 'country', 'not', 'approve', 'lies', 'have', 'been', 'fed', 're-elected', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'co-conspirators', 'American', 'reputation', 'will', 'sink', 'even', 'deeper', 'reader', 'convincing', 'Moore', 'film', 'case', 'even', 'more', 'end', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'America', 'not', 'only', 'must', 'know', 'raising', 'mirror', 'America', 'face', 'probably', 'most', 'patriotic', 'can', 'do', 'right', 'now.Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'ends', 'thought', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'nothing', 'respect', 'approval', 'audience', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'put', 'line', 'ask', 'only', 'put', 'harm', 'way', 'when', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'How', 'people', 'can', 'say', 'agree', 'same', 'time', 'still', 'support', 'what', 'Bush', 'done', '-all', 'evidence', 'him-', 'live', 'contradiction', 'Yes', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'was', 'scum', 'earth', 'sons', 'cronies', 'were', 'better', 'was', 'not', 'war', 'fight', 'reasons', 'taking', 'war', 'were', 'bring', 'gift', 'freedom', 'Almighty', 'Iraq', 'oil', 'strategic', 'security', 'whatever', 'accusations', 'WMDs', 'imaginary', 'links', 'al', 'quaeda', 'do', 'not', 'justify', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'everything', 'possible', 'not', 'serve', 'uniform', 'when', 'was', 'duty', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'now', 'so', 'carelessly', 'take', 'war', 'nothing', 'less', 'tragedy']",Fahrenheit 9/11

I however had different reasons for not watching this mainly because being an Irishman I thought that since I do not vote in the American elections it's not really going to help me that much. I wouldn't say that this was a flaw......it's just that it felt like a propaganda machine about George W Bush's time in power and how he used September 11th 2001 to his advantage and if you really did watch this you'd really have to vote John Kerry............so here we are, Bush is still in power ( so much for the propaganda working ) and so I finally watch the documentary. And it is shocking. You see the horrors of the brutality of war and there is no sugary-sweet rendition and you see that American media is not allowed to show the mass amount of American coffins and the changes in the opinion of one Lila Lipscomb. Beforehand she's just a regular "" conservative Democrat "" who is proud that her son and others are fighting to free the Iraqi people. But from what? The people there seem not to mind Saddam. Even though I'm skeptical that all Iraqis love Saddam I do have to wonder where George Bush got these Iraqis thanking him that he freed the Iraqi people.....it's a very strange set of affairs when you find that most of the children in Iraq are at a funfair while GWB declares war on Iraq. It pretty much is certain that this was an agenda motivated by the fact that we "" don't forget this guy almost shot my daddy dead."" Which shows that Iraq was an entirely personal agenda which doesn't even begin to explain how dangerous this president is.What I find more disturbing is the one elderly Iraqi woman feeling completely enraged by what is happening to her fellow countrymen. She's almost manic with rage and tears for her dead countrymen and women. It's frightening and I can fully sympathize with her. When Lila discovers that her son had died in the line of duty and feels similar feelings of dismay and betrayal....although it is moving you don't honestly get the same sense of violent rage and, as bad as this probably sounds, you don't feel as sorry for her ( which I sincerely do feel sorry for her don't get me wrong ) as the Iraqi woman. Besides after seeing how the American army treated it's prisoners it's really hard for you to portray them as the good guys.While there are a few inaccuracies somewhere in the film ( you probably might see them along the way, you might not ), and you may still get the overriding sense that this is a propaganda machine ( if you live outside the US ), there is a sense that the film means well and tries to show a different view that is not shown by the American media. Even still, this film really is just preaching to the converted so if you think Bush has done a good job and are unflinching in your support, you know what you think. However it would be nice if everyone saw this movie in America but......you can't depend on people's beliefs just to change just like that.

Completely ignoring the fact that this movie has very little in common with real documentaries, this movie begins with a rambling, incoherent conclusion  that repetitiously attacks Bush and his administration in every way conceivably possible. Now, I realize most of us already have opinions on a subject and it is good to be honest about the fact that none of us can truly be impartial. But the whole point of a well-crafted argument is that you provide your audience with copious evidence, and you present it in such an artful way that the audience reaches your conclusion by themselves by the end of the movie. This even-handed persuasion obviously escapes Moore, as the first few minutes of the movie consist of a very hateful rant about Bush and his policies. Only after this rant  does Moore begin to provide any evidence as to why we should hate Bush.  The feeling I got from the movie was of a little kid tattletaling on his older brother.

Taylor ""GFT""","[28, 43]","I feel that conservatives and liberals alike are looking at FAHRENHEIT 9/11 through the filter of their own agendas: it is not really an attack on the Republican Party, nor is it really a Democratic election-year commercial.  At heart, the film is an attack on political powers influenced by big business, which strives to manipulate the public through fear in order to turn a handsome profit.  But this is not to say that George W. Bush doesn't get a terrific beating here--he does, and so does his administration, with Ashcroft coming off as particularly ludicrous.In the first third of the film, Moore goes to tremendous pains to demonstrate the existence of a &quot;good old boys&quot; network between the Bush family and Saudi money men, a network Moore claims facilitated the flight of wealthy Saudis from the United States in the immediate wake of 9/11.  While intriguing, Moore's position on this point is distinctly interpretive--but there is much more in the film that is not.In the past, Moore has been accused of startling his targets into unstudied responses by unexpectedly leaping out at them with camera in hand, but no such accusation can arise here.  In FAHRENHEIT 9/11 Moore relies upon media coverage of Bush, and while the coverage is edited for effect there is no dodging the bullet: Bush was where he was, doing what he was doing, and saying what he was saying of his own free will and in full knowledge that the cameras were rolling.  If Bush emerges from this looking like a buffoon, he has no one to blame but himself.At this point the film's edge turns razor sharp and deadly.  It is very easy to forget what someone said in an interview or speech several years ago--but it is also easy to roll the footage and remind us of it, not to mention pointing out various inconsistencies in the process.  But for all the film's Bush buffoonery, the most chilling aspect of FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is the portrait it paints of corporate greed and human tragedy.In parts of the film Moore approaches his subject with a comic edge, pointing out some of the absurdities arising from the Patriot Act.  But simply put, there are a great many people making a great deal of money out of the United States' invasion of Iraq.  Corporations and investors rake in big bucks while, as one American solider puts it, an American trucker driving five miles a day in Iraq makes more in a week than a solider will make in a month.  When one adds to this chilling observation the fact that the Bush administration has done everything from cut military pay to seek closure of V.A. hospitals... well, it all adds up to a fairly poisonous portrait of both business and politics as usual.  Lives are lost, but no matter, at least so long as the polls are good and the money keeps rolling in.Is the film biased?  Without a doubt.  Is it speculative?  Yes, but only to a certain degree.

A SENDEROFF ""GS""","[17, 23]","As a Cuban-American (second generation) and Independent registered voter, I can say that this film is NOT liberal propaganda, (...). Moore is a true patriot and has found a way to turn our first amendment into informative art. I am sure he is on the top-ten list under the Patriot Act's ""I' gonna get you"" list for unveiling the truth of all truths. People are actually criticizing Moore's genius of piecing together the ties that George W. Bush has with the bin Ladens and the royal family of Saudi Arabia. These ties are both business and personal, all oil connected.Much goes on zeroing-in on the Iraqi war and how the link between Al-Quaeda and Saddam Hussein is often confused by 42% of Americans when it is undoubtedly nonexistent, does this make sense?A reason Moore won the Cannes Film Festival's top prize, THE Palme d'Or is not because the French hate Americans but they actually give awards to a masterpiece of art when they see one.Moore has many candid footage clips of Paul Wolfowitz, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, Dick Cheney, John Ashcroft, Donald Rumsfeld, and ""Dubya"" that they never thought millions would see! Mr. Moore does not mock them solely, they have done an incredible job of doing so on-camera themselves. The movie is not only extremely informative and entertaining, but also heartfelt and include extreme up-close footage with our warriors in Iraq.  I admire these individuals for their leadership/courage but their leader has lied to the entire American public.It is one of the first film documentaries to focus on how fundamentally corrupt this White House administration is.I highly recommend that anyone with an open mind, whether Republican, Democrat, Independent, or Green give this film a chance and decide for yourself if this plays an unfair portrayal of George W. Bush's intent to wage war with Iraq. After watching Bush speak (not just in this movie, I can clearly say that idiocy is what moves the stupidest president we have ever had.

FISHER,"[13, 47]","Fahrenheit 9/11 will disappoint the non-partisan viewer twice: on the way in and on the way out.On the way in, I came to the movie expecting a biting, hilarious satire of the present administration a la Saturday Night Live's ""Strategery"" silliness, perhaps with a serious point to make. What the first two-thirds of the movie actually provided, however, was merely unflattering video footage of Bush 43 and others in the administration overlaid with conspiratorial commentary that we're all familiar with involving Florida, Texas Air National Guard, Halliburton, Prince Bandar, etc. I thought that there was a lot of raw material there, but I fell asleep twice during this part.The one part of the movie that began to live up to these expectations shows Moore in Washington with a handful of Marine Corps enlistment documents trying to get Congressmen to have their children enlist. That was funny, and it had a point to make, but that was all there was of this sort.What woke me up was the amazing videotaped story of Lila Lipscomb. She works at a welfare office in Flint, MI (Moore's hometown) and has two children in the military. In the initial interviews we see her describing herself as a conservative Democrat who is proud of the work she does, proud to be a part of the American Middle Class and proud of her children's service.Then her son is killed and we see her transformed by her grief. That, plus some scenes of amputee veterans brings a very somber and serious tone to the movie. But it goes nowhere in particular with it, and it contrasts incongruously with the first part of the movie. So, the second disappointment is on the way out ... the movie could have been a lot more but its slanted, partisan failed-attempt at satire ruined it.The other movies at Cannes must have been dull, because this one is not all that great.",2,Disappoints Twice,1088208000,"06 26, 2004",2004,1840,"['Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'will', 'disappoint', 'non-partisan', 'viewer', 'twice', 'way', 'way', 'way', 'came', 'movie', 'expecting', 'biting', 'hilarious', 'satire', 'present', 'administration', 'la', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Strategery', 'silliness', 'perhaps', 'serious', 'point', 'make', 'What', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'movie', 'actually', 'provided', 'however', 'was', 'merely', 'unflattering', 'video', 'footage', 'Bush', '43', 'others', 'administration', 'overlaid', 'conspiratorial', 'commentary', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'involving', 'Florida', 'Texas', 'Air', 'National', 'Guard', 'Halliburton', 'Prince', 'Bandar', 'etc', 'thought', 'was', 'lot', 'raw', 'material', 'there', 'fell', 'asleep', 'twice', 'part.The', 'one', 'part', 'movie', 'began', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'Moore', 'Washington', 'handful', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'enlistment', 'documents', 'trying', 'get', 'Congressmen', 'have', 'children', 'enlist', 'was', 'funny', 'had', 'point', 'make', 'was', 'was', 'sort.What', 'woke', 'up', 'was', 'amazing', 'videotaped', 'story', 'Lila', 'Lipscomb', 'welfare', 'office', 'Flint', 'MI', 'Moore', 'hometown', 'two', 'children', 'military', 'initial', 'interviews', 'see', 'describing', 'conservative', 'Democrat', 'who', 'proud', 'work', 'proud', 'be', 'part', 'American', 'Middle', 'Class', 'proud', 'children', 'service.Then', 'son', 'killed', 'see', 'transformed', 'grief', 'scenes', 'amputee', 'veterans', 'very', 'somber', 'serious', 'tone', 'movie', 'nowhere', 'particular', 'incongruously', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'So', 'second', 'disappointment', 'way', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'slanted', 'partisan', 'failed-attempt', 'satire', 'ruined', 'other', 'movies', 'Cannes', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'dull', 'one', 'not', 'great']",Fahrenheit 9/11

Well, unecessarily grotesque images are used to portray facts which are not stressed throughout the movie, the camera work at times was so awful it made me sick, but WORST OF ALL, the film is used specifically as a decoy to get his radicalist ideas across to the American public.As some may know, PT Barnum once said you could never go broke underestimating the American people. He was so right, and this movie is a fantastic example of why this phrase is so acurate. If you label the content matter in a film ""controversial"" and then put the bloated, biased information in a colorful package and try to make it look like the narator actually has a heart, then the maker of the movie will make money.What Michael Moore also accomplished in this film was the ability to get across data that was incorrect and severely flawed. Just because the movie may be ""enjoyable"" to some, does not mean that the film is accomplishing its true goals as a documentary.Michael Moore is not a documenter, he is a radical liberal -- we know this. And sure, there are millions of those across the united states, as there are the same number of radical conservatives - but Michael Moore easily is able to get across his ""documentary"" and his ""facts"" as propaganda. Simply put, this is a project used as a coy to get his ideas heard. Instead of going on marches, demonstrations, or even suicide bombing himself like plenty of other people with the same ideas do, Michael Moore insists on eating lots of hot dogs and giving the misguided American public ""knowledge"", which is really just propaganda put into a million-dollar-budget film.And unlike many/most fictional films, this movie has no moral to teach, and no message to give aside from his so-called ""confidential, secretive data"". You aren't going to get something out of watching this film if you are not easily fooled, and you are not going to want to pick this film up again after watching.What saves it?

In a way, Moore's decision to focus on issues of such dramatic political implications (Iraq War, Saudi-American collusion) is unfortunate, because it drowns out some of his less contentious and therefore more cogent observations. His delivery in 9/11 condescends where Bowling for Columbine enlightened; it chokes on its own venom where its predecessor stung with its charm. But what appears to be Moore's central focus -- the culture of fear in America -- remains, albeit it more obscured by the fog of so much agression and self-righteousness. In Bowling for Columbine, Moore drew attention to profound and disturbingly comical distinctions between American news, which is obssessed with violence, impending attack and celebrity worship, and Canadian news, which concerns itself with the new speed bump just laid in front of your local high school. The dangerous sense of threat, paranoia and even apocalypse this engenders in American audiences is not even the most devastating of its consequences. The real misfortune is that this hysteria-rampant journalism distracts millions of Americans from the more local, grassroots news Canadian outlets report: stuff that is happening right in our backyards and is thus of more immediate importance and more susceptible to the efforts and opinions of concerned individuals. One wonders whether the federal government fears that our increasingly technological and media-driven culture is slowly but surely rendering centralized government obsolete and would rather scare us into continued dependence and conformity. Fahrenheit 9/11 powerfully elaborates upon this charge, honing in on the predictable target of the multi-colored terror alert system, a much-criticized tool by which Tom Ridge & Co. allege to inform the public on the potential for terror attacks. Moore does a compelling job of exposing the many conveniences of such a method, particularly its power to distract voters from more local and immediate concerns such as health care, education (America's literacy rate ranks only 49th world-wide!), or growing signs that a reinstatement of the draft is on the horizon. This last issue is surely one that the fed would rather spring on us than debate at the possible expense of frightened or embittered voters. Moore's movie may be heavy-handed and conveniently editted, but it is frequently eloquent and moving in its cinematography, courageous, and, with regard to the culture of fear, enlightening.",4,The Fear Culture,1091145600,"07 30, 2004",2004,2633,"['Aside', 'Moore', 'arguable', 'politics', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'up', 'where', 'superior', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'left', 'off', 'investigation', 'America', 'burgeoning', 'culture', 'fear', 'way', 'Moore', 'decision', 'focus', 'issues', 'such', 'dramatic', 'political', 'implications', 'Iraq', 'War', 'Saudi-American', 'collusion', 'unfortunate', 'out', 'less', 'contentious', 'therefore', 'more', 'cogent', 'observations', 'delivery', '9/11', 'condescends', 'where', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'enlightened', 'own', 'venom', 'where', 'predecessor', 'stung', 'charm', 'what', 'be', 'Moore', 'central', 'focus', 'culture', 'fear', 'America', 'more', 'obscured', 'fog', 'so', 'much', 'agression', 'self-righteousness', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'Moore', 'drew', 'attention', 'profound', 'disturbingly', 'comical', 'distinctions', 'American', 'news', 'obssessed', 'violence', 'impending', 'attack', 'celebrity', 'worship', 'Canadian', 'news', 'new', 'speed', 'bump', 'just', 'laid', 'front', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'dangerous', 'sense', 'threat', 'paranoia', 'even', 'apocalypse', 'engenders', 'American', 'audiences', 'not', 'even', 'most', 'devastating', 'consequences', 'real', 'misfortune', 'hysteria-rampant', 'journalism', 'distracts', 'millions', 'Americans', 'more', 'local', 'grassroots', 'news', 'Canadian', 'outlets', 'report', 'stuff', 'happening', 'right', 'backyards', 'thus', 'more', 'immediate', 'importance', 'more', 'susceptible', 'efforts', 'opinions', 'concerned', 'individuals', 'One', 'federal', 'government', 'fears', 'increasingly', 'technological', 'media-driven', 'culture', 'slowly', 'surely', 'rendering', 'centralized', 'government', 'obsolete', 'would', 'rather', 'scare', 'continued', 'dependence', 'conformity', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'powerfully', 'charge', 'honing', 'predictable', 'target', 'multi-colored', 'terror', 'alert', 'system', 'much-criticized', 'tool', 'Tom', 'Ridge', 'Co.', 'allege', 'inform', 'public', 'potential', 'terror', 'attacks', 'Moore', 'compelling', 'job', 'exposing', 'many', 'conveniences', 'such', 'method', 'particularly', 'power', 'distract', 'voters', 'more', 'local', 'immediate', 'concerns', 'such', 'health', 'care', 'education', 'America', 'literacy', 'rate', 'only', '49th', 'world-wide', 'growing', 'signs', 'reinstatement', 'draft', 'horizon', 'last', 'issue', 'surely', 'one', 'fed', 'would', 'rather', 'spring', 'debate', 'possible', 'expense', 'frightened', 'embittered', 'voters', 'Moore', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'heavy-handed', 'conveniently', 'editted', 'frequently', 'eloquent', 'moving', 'cinematography', 'courageous', 'regard', 'culture', 'fear', 'enlightening']",Fahrenheit 9/11

When you are aware of the source (Moore) and his views on the country this ""documentary"" can be a helpful educational tool, but you must not take 100% of this to heart.Moore does not make things up, BUT he does present some of the facts of the movie in a way that makes them more shocking than they are in reality. For example : Moore makes a big deal of the fact that the Bush family has personal/business ties to the bin Laden family, which taken on its face IS shocking, but when you research it you will learn that anyone with a business hand in oil has relations with the bin Laden family, and it is a huge family, who disowned the infamous Osama. So the fact that the Bush's associate with the large bin Laden family shouldn't be quite as shocking as it comes across.So while his movie is filled with actual facts some of the things he points out aren't really as uncommon as he would like us to believe (like the segment which he is SHOCKED to learn that members of Congress don't read all of the bills they pass in their entirety... well DUHHHH they are thousands of pages and there are tons of them!)On the otherhand some of the things simply are shocking, and there is no way around them, such as the mother of a fallen solider sharing her story of how her sons final government check was docked the days of that week in which he was dead. That's disgustingly disrespectful of our government.I have to say I enjoyed the film. Moore has a way of infusing entertainment into his fact. He does make several points and theories as to why the wars following 9-11 happened.I think that if you view this movie with a sceptical eye you will be satisfied with it. Just go into viewing it after you learn a bit about Moore and his agenda. As with everything that has to do with politics there is always an agenda, and if you go into this movie aware of Moore's agenda you will know what to black out and what to take in. Just read up on his facts and listen to all sides of the story.

629921,AO5F3MTTFCQR8,B00005JNEI,"girldiver ""Enjoy!""","[84, 134]","Let me just acknowledge my disinterest in the movies of Michael Moore in general. I usually go to see movies for entertainment and although he is entertaining his subject matter usually isn't escapism so I generally avoid his movies. I actually only saw one other movie by him, Roger and Me, and that was years ago. What interested me in this movie was a NPR interview that discussed both its merits and downfalls, the interview intrigued me and so I was compelled to get advanced tickets and stand in line to see the movie!This movie covers a lot of ground so at times you wonder what are we talking about now and then he meanders back to his point of view. Let's not forget this is a movie based on Michael Moores point of view no matter how many people share it. The movie has been called a documentary but it's not filmed like a documentary most people are used too. There is just too much ground to cover. So the film does have merit it's chocked full of facts that are disturbing about the Bush family and their connection with the Saudi's, contradictory interviews of Bush and his cabinet, and personal insights from a select number of Americans.I enjoyed the film it was humorous but at times hard to watch. The movie begins with the idea that the last four years was a dream but in essence a nightmare for Mr. Moore. This movie has validity I just wish Mr. Moore didn't hate President Bush so much. The movie certainly makes light of President Bush's ability as President and Leader of the Free World. Perhaps this movie would be embraced by the Republican's if Mr. Moore had stuck to just the facts and not immersed the film with his personal dislike of President Bush and therefore the controversy emerges.All in all the facts in this movie are incredibly disturbing! Even if you don't believe everything the movie tells you it makes you think about the dispersion of information by the media, the lack of leadership among the Democrats, the motivations of the current White House, and the distinct class distinction in America Today.As for the movie making, like I said there were a couple of times I wondered where this was going but Mr. Moore redirects often and takes you through the maze and back out and you say to yourself, WOW I never thought of that. This movie although not a classic documentary it does make you think and want to find out the truth whether you share Mr. Moores truth or not.

One of the most effective moments, which will leave conservatives gaping in frustration, is when he shows, a few months before the 911 attacks, footage of Bush, Cheney, Rice, Wolfowitz, and the rest of the Bush buttkissers saying, in very smug and self-assured voices, that Saddam Hussein has no WMDs and has no means of acquiring WMDs.

629925,A3FBTJCCNQXW2U,B00005JNEI,Goldenroom,"[8, 18]","This is not a documentary. It's a mostly truthful, but bias look at the Bush administration. Most of this film deals with the Bush family connection to terrorist funding saudis, the Bush response to 911, and the Iraq war.I admit that this movie is very emotional. The first part I cried at was a clip of George W Bush reading to a group of children in Florida on the morning of 911. In the clip he is told about both planes hitting the towers. You would think as president that he would spring into action and get on the phone, but instead he sits in the class room like some sort of moron. The most emotional part of the film deals with the unnecessary human suffering of the Iraq war. Everything from clear footage of operation Shock and Awe, amputated US troops, and the families of dead US troops is troubling and sad to watch.For a film that covers a very serious subject, I didn't like some of the sarcastic humor in this film(such as making fun of the coalition members). I also don't like how Moore edited the film to fit his agenda. For example: There is a part of the film where moore is talking to members of congress about sending their kids to Iraq.

Like Michael Moore, I was criticized as unpatriotic and unsupportive of the troops (even though I served in the US Army from 1978-1984).  I had seen much of the information presented in the film previously, though from separate sources such as books and newspaper articles.  What Moore has done with 'Fahrenheit 9/11' is bring all the various facts concerning the Bush administration's misadventures all together in one controversial film.No one should kid themselves-Michael Moore is a partisan ,and is firmly against what George Bush and his cronies represent. He fully expected - and welcomed - the firestorm of criticism his film generated. The irony is that as time goes by, more and more of what is presented in 'Fahrenheit' is being confirmed by former members of the Bush administration, arms inspectors in the Iraq invasion aftermath, and even by Bush and Cheney themselves!  Even powerful members of Bush's own Republican Party are now condemning the mess that the Iraq 'liberation' has become.I was enraged by what I saw in this movie.  How could so many Americans be so blind (and a large proportion of the population STILL refuses to see the truth)?  How could our media function as a cheerleading section for what was happening?  If nothing else, this film is a call to all Americans to vote to change the direction our country is now headed (or at minimum, at least express SOME kind of opinion by going to the ballot box).If you haven't yet done so, see this film.  Formulate your opinion not just on what you see from it, but look at other sources.

629930,A1X15AQVSCKKRG,B00005JNEI,GreatMovieCriticForever,"[41, 60]","Michael Moore, does it again with the Cannes Film Festival winning and soon to be Academy Award nominated documentary ""Fahrenheit 911"" his triumph hit centering on the corruption of the Bush Administration following the September 11 attacks. ""Fahrenheit 911"" was made now for political attacks or gain, but simply as Michael Moore has done to tell the truth when no one else has, IN fact during several points of the film, several familiar reporters: Dan Rather, Katie Couric, Matt Laurer all show their lies and ignorance in supporting Mr. Bush agenda to invade Iraq and blame Saddam Hussein for the Sept 11 attacks. However Bush at the same time uses Sept 11 in an attempt to salvage his downward approval ratings, using the attack to bully and invade other countries that don't approve of his policies, pardoning several corrupt organizations that have done wrong doing, and last but not least, having profitable communication with and protecting the Osama Bin Laden Family and then contradicting himself with false allegations of nuclear weapons of Mass Destruction which still has not been found since the days of President Clinton.The movie starts of with the debacle that was the President Election in 2000 with the fiasco in Florida, led by Presiden't Bush's brother Jed and his cohorts of liars to fix the election in Florida in Bush's favor when it looks like Al Gore (who won several states in his favor)was going to win Florida and the Presidential Election. Moore points out how and a company called DATA BASE TECHNOLOGIES manipulated and lied with the vote counts in Bush's direction, securing the state of Florida and making George W. Bush the President of the United States. Last but not least the ties Bush has with Supreme Court that dashed Gore's hope for Presidency. Of course Bush himself who leads the war in Irad has his own contradictory military records. The movie then shows us the horrible day that was Sept 11, 2001 and then shows us President Bush's nonchalant attitude during the first minutes of Sept 11 where he attended some small preschool during a reading of ""billy and his goat"" while having a peaceful reaction when a member of security teams tells him about the hijacking. Bush does not flinch or show any regard for human life during these first minutes.The movie then shows us how Bush and company took advantage of Sept. 11 attacks to use it for their own agenda, that is initiating war with Iraq, arresting people of Middle Eastern decent (except the Osama Bin Laden Family) and of course the most controversial aspect of the whole movie, George W. Bush having business associations with Osama Bin Laden family. That about sends chills down my spine what about you? When we have a U.S. President who swears on the bible to serve the people of America and yet really is serving his own agenda and those who don't agree to his terms watch out!!! Of course since Sept 11, we have learned that President Bush did receive ample warning of terrorist attacks including a four year memo that was kept hidden. Jack Cloogen, former FBI Agent, details the failure to prevent Sept 11 briefly in the movie. The 911 Commission has also shown that there was also nothing done by the FBI and CIA (despite their intelligence reports that an attack was imminent) to prevent the attacks.Moore then shows us the downright lies about Saddam Hussein going back to 2001 when the disgraceful General Colin Powell says that Saddam Hussein quote ""doesnt pose a threat"" and has no weapons of mass destruction. Of course pre Sept 11 despite our boasts about security with President Clinton our security problems and problems with trust were lousy. As covered by ABCNEWS, CBSNEWS, firefighters , police officers, had unworking equipment including walkie talkies, mass confusions and lack of communication, this in turn describes the war with Iraq. Remember George Bush never got permission from Congress or Senate to launch this war and in part several of our former cowardly allies: Great Britain, Uk, Dominican Republic have backed out . The American casualties for the war have been great over 200 servicemen killed in the line of duty. Yet we have the arrogant and pompous saying ""were winning the war"" while sitting home all cozy in the White House. Now ""Fahrenheit 911"" was actually financed by Walt Disney Company yet, when it came to release the movie, the Disney still led by cowards like Michael Eisner put the movie on the shelves. However ""Lions Gate Films (who also released Beyond the Mat) stepped up to the plate and showed guts in releasing the film. Then as I hosted a thread on IMDb cheap, corrupted reporters like Matt Laurer tried to attack Michael Moore before the movie was even released. Laurer, acts so unprofessional to Moore that its hard to believe this guy has a job as reporter for NBC when he really is just a liar, a pasty doing a con job for a higher power. He failed as ""Fahrenheit 911"" is one of the highest grossing documentaries of all times breaking box office records and earning the respect and intrigue of many Americans who have seen the lies exposed by their government, president and Military.A special note of interest is that Moore in the NBC Dateline interview mentioned how one scene was cut, that is when an American soldier, beats and assaults a prisoner of film. this was recorded way before the vile disgraceful actions of the men and women of the Army at Abu Gharaid, where allegations of prisoner abuse have now been proven true by those graphic pictures and sex tapes.All the facts I have listed are from watching the movie numerous times, now with what happened in the political debateswith John Kerry and George Bush its

The great thing that I seeing now is that people are now finally aware of the corruption that our American President George W. has done. Of course several other respected news sources have already talked about what Moore does in G.W. interest with Osama and his constant pursuit of profit.The war in Iraq is nothing more but a war for profit as I heardthis on KPFK radio from one military member. The BBC recentlydid a documentary on the George Bush family fortune and what's covered is what's essentially what Moore covers. George W. Bushis just another cheap American who promised our country  iberty, justice and peace and has delivered four years of misery. Top it all behind closed door as one critic he hasaligned himself with greedy corporations like Enron has triedto drill for oil in Alaska, has had other business endeavorsat the cost of the American people and now weve had enough.The shamble in Florida as one person , pretty much was a foreshadowing of what was to come from this disgraceful American. I personally find it pitiful to call this man our President.Anyhow, Moore also pokes fun at how many congress members often do nothing and often pass laws that they don't even read with his focus of the ""Patriot Act"".Cheap critics who call this bias are only showcasing their corrupton as individuals when they attack Moore. Obviously theycan't deny anything that Moore points out in his movies, so their childish reactions is to call him fat, and uneducated.

629932,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B00005JNEI,Gregor von Kallahann,"[16, 17]","There's a certain irony in the fact that this movie is giving FOX News commentators (and viewers, apparently, if the commentary below is any indication)such a case of apoplexy. Definitely a case of the pot calling the kettle cracked.Sure it's slanted, but you know what? Some of us are grown-ups and we can decide for ourselves what's factual and what may be specious. And believe me there is nothing here any less specious than one gets in a typical evening of FOX News broadcasting!What David Brock has labeled &quot;the Great Republican Noise Machine&quot; has steadily been eroding debate in this country by successfully intimidating the &quot;liberal media&quot; into giving this president a virtual pass. People like Moore, at least, offer something of a corrective on this score. It's refreshing to see that, yes, there are still impassioned, unintimidated liberals out there.

629936,A1VDA6GS3N714H,B00005JNEI,"Guy Denutte ""A concerned citizen""","[5, 10]","In Fahrenheit 9/11 the strange relationship between the Bush family and the Bin Laden's is exposed.  Both families had interests in the Carlyle Group, one of the major arms suppliers of the US military.  That partially explains how it was possible that 24 family members of the Bin Laden's were flying to their home country after the attacks, the only planes officially permitted to fly at that time by... the White House...  All other planes were kept on the ground.  An ex-FBI agent claims this to be totally absurd.  If you have a suspected murderer, you first talk to whoever is close to him, family members first.  That's what any cop would do.  Why didn't president Bush let this happen ?  Was he afraid something could have been revealed?This picture also shows there never really was any serious effort to find the suspected ""Bad Guy"", Osama bin Laden.  It took the US military two months to start looking after him, sending only 11.000 troops to Afghanistan, just enough to have a new president in office, who helped US corporations in to build a new pipeline.  The search on Osama bin Laden was stopped before it ever began.  In this picture, you will literally hear Bush say : ""I don't know where he is and don't want to spend much time on it"".  So here we had the biggest ""foreign attack"" on the US, performed by 15 Saudi's, under alleged orders of Osama Bin Laden, and Bush doesn't care !?  Probably because either he had nothing to do with the attacks, or worse, because it would have been too dangerous for him telling the full truth, should they ever have captured him alive.  We must never forget Bin Laden was a CIA-man.  And the saying goes : once CIA, always CIA.Although Bush doesn't care finding Bin Laden, he insists in fighting a ""war on terror"" !  Who are the enemies then ?  Well, it seems that YOU are, or maybe I am.  After 9/11 everybody suddenly became a possible ""suspect"".  A Fresno peace group was infiltrated by a secret service agent !  A retired man going to a gym was visited afterward by the FBI (!) because he made a casual remark on Bush.  And at airports breast milk was considered suspect.  This ""war on terror"" was above all a war on the liberties of the American people, although it's called, with a certain irony, the ""Patriot Act"".  And the American people believed it.  The objective was having the American people to turn to their ""leader"" to protect them.  But protect them from who ?  The most dangerous men at that time had their office in the White House.  They were the ""leaders"" - like Cheney and Rumsfeld.  And in this atmosphere of fear the war on Iraq was started, in March 2003, when Iraq had nothing whatsoever to do with the alleged ""foreign attack"" on 9/11.  Rumsfeld says in this movie, after you see some images of dead babies, children, women and men in Iraq, that the military puts ""a lot of humanity in the war effort"".  I don't believe in God, but Rumsfeld does give me a pretty good idea of what the Devil looks like !",5,The republic of fear,1234483200,"02 13, 2009",2009,2986,"['Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'strange', 'relationship', 'Bush', 'family', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'exposed', 'families', 'had', 'interests', 'Carlyle', 'Group', 'one', 'major', 'arms', 'suppliers', 'US', 'military', 'partially', 'how', 'was', 'possible', '24', 'family', 'members', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'were', 'flying', 'home', 'country', 'attacks', 'only', 'planes', 'officially', 'permitted', 'fly', 'time', 'White', 'House', 'other', 'planes', 'were', 'kept', 'ground', 'ex-FBI', 'agent', 'claims', 'be', 'totally', 'absurd', 'have', 'suspected', 'murderer', 'first', 'talk', 'whoever', 'close', 'family', 'members', 'first', 'what', 'cop', 'would', 'do', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'president', 'Bush', 'let', 'happen', 'Was', 'afraid', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'revealed', 'picture', 'also', 'there', 'never', 'really', 'was', 'serious', 'effort', 'find', 'suspected', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Laden', 'took', 'US', 'military', 'two', 'months', 'start', 'looking', 'sending', 'only', '11.000', 'troops', 'Afghanistan', 'just', 'enough', 'have', 'new', 'president', 'office', 'who', 'helped', 'US', 'corporations', 'build', 'new', 'pipeline', 'search', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Laden', 'was', 'stopped', 'ever', 'began', 'picture', 'will', 'literally', 'hear', 'Bush', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'So', 'here', 'had', 'biggest', 'foreign', 'attack', 'US', 'performed', '15', 'Saudi', 'alleged', 'orders', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'Bush', ""n't"", 'care', 'Probably', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'attacks', 'worse', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'dangerous', 'telling', 'full', 'truth', 'should', 'ever', 'have', 'captured', 'alive', 'must', 'never', 'forget', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'was', 'CIA-man', 'saying', 'once', 'CIA', 'always', 'CIA.Although', 'Bush', ""n't"", 'care', 'finding', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'fighting', 'war', 'terror', 'Who', 'are', 'enemies', 'then', 'Well', 'YOU', 'are', 'maybe', 'am', '9/11', 'everybody', 'suddenly', 'became', 'possible', 'suspect', 'Fresno', 'peace', 'group', 'was', 'infiltrated', 'secret', 'service', 'agent', 'retired', 'man', 'going', 'gym', 'was', 'visited', 'afterward', 'FBI', 'made', 'casual', 'remark', 'Bush', 'airports', 'breast', 'milk', 'was', 'considered', 'suspect', 'war', 'terror', 'was', 'war', 'liberties', 'American', 'people', 'called', 'certain', 'irony', 'Patriot', 'Act', 'American', 'people', 'believed', 'objective', 'was', 'having', 'American', 'people', 'turn', 'leader', 'protect', 'protect', 'who', 'most', 'dangerous', 'men', 'time', 'had', 'office', 'White', 'House', 'were', 'leaders', 'Cheney', 'Rumsfeld', 'atmosphere', 'fear', 'war', 'Iraq', 'was', 'started', 'March', '2003', 'when', 'Iraq', 'had', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'do', 'alleged', 'foreign', 'attack', '9/11', 'Rumsfeld', 'movie', 'see', 'images', 'dead', 'babies', 'children', 'women', 'men', 'Iraq', 'military', 'lot', 'humanity', 'war', 'effort', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'God', 'Rumsfeld', 'give', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'Devil']",Fahrenheit 9/11

629938,A1QFH9H4VN0QJ5,B00005JNEI,"""hammershu""","[16, 33]","One could sum up Fahrenheit 9/11 just by looking at its movie poster.  At the top it reads, ""Controversy...What Controversy?""  The documentary has received so much praise and scorn, that you would have had to have lived in a hole to not hear about this film.  Not since The Passion of the Christ have people felt so strongly for or against a film, let alone a documentary.  The ever so contentious political bad boy Michael Moore has created an ambiguous political satire that delivers punches and blows at our president, Mr. George W. Bush.Mr. Moore has always been famous for his political humor and wild ideas on film rather than his journalistic views in his documentaries.  He has been known to stretch the truth and not tell all truths in his film works.  Is there any difference in his new one?  No. Mr. Moore is still very good at manipulating his audience and persuading them to believe what he wants to believe.  But is this really a crime?  I don't think so because most documentaries hide a lot of truth due to the directors' willingness to do almost anything to get their point across.In saying that, I must admit this is Mr. Moore's best documentary. Though it may be one-sided, you have to respect Mr. Moore and all the time and effort he obviously put forth for this film.  He has gathered facts from various sources to describe the entire presidency of Mr. Bush (mostly concerning 9/11 and the Iraqi war).  In fact I think the biggest question the documentary poses to the audience is how Mr. Moore acquired some of the footage, documents, and facts for his film.  It would be interesting to see a documentary regarding how he obtained all his information.  It is unbelievable and really impressive to observe all the research he compiled in completing this documentary.It is at this point that the documentary becomes extremely one-sided.  Mr. Moore may make an interesting documentary, but his accolades come more from his political humor, not from his journalism.  Portions of the truth are told but not necessarily the entire truth.  In the documentary he mentions all the great countries we have supporting us in the Iraqi war.  This is where Moore's sarcastic humor, for which he is famous, enters in as he mentions only the less powerful countries we have on our side.  Of course Britain and Australia is not mentioned.  Why would Mr. Moore neglect to mention some of the powerful countries that are supporting us? Because it would not cause Mr. Bush to appear so incompetent.  Many more of these ""half-truths"" can be seen throughout the entire documentary.  But when a documentary is extremely one-sided as in the case as this one, one must realize at the outset that some truths will be stretched.As I have mentioned, Fahrenheit 9/11 is entertaining because of its political humor.  It is highly entertaining to see Mr. Moore drive around in an ice cream truck reading the Patriot Act through a megaphone to congress members heading to work.  The movie's funniest ""prank"" is when Mr. Moore takes to the streets asking members of congress if they would like for their sons or daughters to enlist in the army.  The reactions are priceless.  It's also hilarious watching some of the congress members flee when they discover it is Michael Moore pursuing them.  Obviously he has become a threat to them and they fear being embarrassed on camera.  It's amazing to see how one man can cause so much controversy.Unlike his other films, Mr. Moore is almost absent in this documentary.  Except for the stunts already mentioned, he mostly serves as narrator and lets the footage speak for itself.  For this reason I believe it is his best documentary.  He has put aside performing outlandish, and in some ways ludicrous, stunts to concentrate more on staying the course of the content.  Less of Michael Moore has given the documentary more substance and feeling.  It's comical yet ironic watching Mr. Bush look at the camera and call for all nations to help stop terrorist killers, but then turn around and say, ""Watch this drive"" as he hits his golf ball down the fairway.  It's also disturbing to watch Mr. Bush on the morning of 9/11.  It was conveyed that he was in a classroom listening to young kids read when he was suddenly escorted out of the room when the planes crashed.  Yet on the footage, he is indeed not escorted suddenly.  He just sits there pondering while looking at a book until finally guards had to urge him out of the room.  It was wise of Mr. Moore to take a step back and let his footage speak for itself.  In this, his documentary becomes more meaningful and powerful.The documentary drags somewhat at the end of the film, yet when it was over I was surprised that I found myself joining in applause with others in the theater.  This documentary, as with his others, is extremely well done and especially brings out good points and questions. Your opinion of Mr. Bush will probably not change with the content of this documentary.  If you love Mr. Bush, you will be offended.  If you hate him, you will cheer.  Yet, the fact remains you will have much to talk about afterwards.  In my opinion, a well-done documentary will lead a person to discuss viewpoints with others long after the completion of the film.  This demonstrates that whether or not you hated it or loved it, you cared enough about it to discuss it.  I recommend this movie to anyone who will be voting this year. Prior to voting, it's always important to hear both sides.  Here is an opportunity to hear one man's opinion on Mr. Bush and his administration.Mr. Moore scores well again for his time and patience in research that has produced a documentary with plenty of well-educated, timely shots at Mr. Bush and congress while remaining funny and informative.

How did we get into this mess and why?  Who are the young men and women putting their lives on the line and how do they really feel about it?  How do the families of these young men and women feel about the war and having their children shipped out to fight?  Micheal Moore does a very good job at answering these questions by illustrating plausible reasons and letting the viewer decide for himself.I live in a conservative state (or so I've been told) yet this film was playing on two screens in one theator.  I was surprised to see that the seats were packed and I could tell by the way much of the audiance would laugh, hiss and jeer in certain scenes that they were not just watching the film to criticize it and Micheal Moore.

Moore wears his liberal bias proudly on his sleeve and his documentary FARENHEIT 9/11 definitely displays that.  However, it does make some powerful points about the possible corruption of the Bush Administration that it leaves the viewer both shaken and questioning previously held beliefs.  Starting from the disputed 2000 election, in which Senators from both parties refused to support attempted protests from angry House members, the film winds its way through the 9/11 disaster (powerfully conveyed only by soundtrack against a black screen) and connecting members from the Bush Administration with members of the Saudi government, as well as members of the Bin Laden family. It also questions the very rationale behind the decision to attack Iraq. Of course, Moore uses a deadpan humor to help draw us in with particularly goofy clips of President Bush boasting about his golf game after a serious comment and Attorney General John Ashcroft singing a horrendous song that he wrote himself.  But it contrasts sharply with footage of Bush's stunned 7 minute wait after hearing of 9/11 and a proud conservative-minded mother whose values are shaken to their core after the death of her son in Iraq.  Some clips are obviously manipulative. The scenes with happy Iraqi children with cuts to Bush's declaration of war against Iraq are pretty obvious. Others including a business seminar in which oil executives are boasting of future profits are sobering.  This movie will not change the minds of Bush partisans or haters, but for those who normally don't attend the political process or are on the fence will find a lot to chew on.

If you have not seen the film, you may have already made assumptions based on the previews and the hype. The movie is not all about George Bush and the war in Iraq, although that is a large portion of it. This film is about the American way of life, our media, and corporate greed that has seeped into the government. This film is not Bush-bashing. This film is not unpatriotic, in fact you can sense the love for America in almost every part of this movie. Most of the things that you are presented with are facts, out there to be verified, there is footage from CSPAN, FOX, CNN and the others. The dates and occurrences are real, and you cannot dispute them, no matter what your political party may be.When I left the theater I was in tears, I could not speak about the movie for about a half hour. It took a long time to think, and absorb what I had seen. While those of us that follow the news (and I do not mean FOX or other network news, but real news) are aware of most everything that you are presented with, this movie puts it all together and in perspective. There was a lot of things in the movie I did not know, a lot of situations I could never have imagined.I think I cried through about 25% of this film. There are a lot of moments I found myself seething in anger, others where I felt complete disappointment in the United States government, and some where all I could do was shake my head in disbelief. One thing I did notice about this film is that Moore was barely on screen, he stepped aside and let the facts, footage and interviews carry the film on it's own. This is great for many of those who feel that Moore himself, is at times, too abrasive.I have heard many people say that this movie is all propaganda, designed to get more votes for the Democratic party in November, but I have to disagree. Those who are Anti-Bush will still be Anti-Bush, those who are Pro-Bush will dismiss this movie and move on, those that are undecided could still go either way depending on how much they already knew. I do not think the intention was to turn Republicans into Democratic voters, but more to get people talking, and to get people thinking.

I must say, however, that I have new respect for him, having seen this movie. I accept that some of the footage may be taken out of context; certainly a great deal of it isn't. I have seen enough television in the past two years or so to know that. Some of the criticism about the movie is just wrong. For instance, I recently saw a film critic complaining about the scene where Moore approaches members of Congress to ask them why their children do not volunteer to go to Iraq. Specifically the critic said that these scenes were disingenuous, since members of congress cannot volunteer their children for military duty even if they wanted to. That is not what Moore says at all. He asks the members of Congress he approaches to ""try"" to get their children to volunteer, something totally different. It is not even debatable that the children of members of the U. S. Congress and Senate, at least most of them, never see military duty and that this war is being fought by men and women of color and sons and daughters of poor and middle-class white famililes-- while our president urges the rest of us to go shopping. Or in his case, he shoots another round of golf.Some of this footage will make your laugh, some scenes will make your cry, much of this movie will make you very angry. And sad. And frightened.Why was Ashcroft sworn in on a stack of three Bibles, I ask. And who were the people that Bush was speaking to at a black tie event, when he said something to the effect that he was talking to the ""haves"" and ""have mores""? It brought a big laugh from his audience but not the theatre audience.I suspect that 99% of the people who see this film already know who they are voting for in November.

Now you may have thought he had no real connection to 9/11, however one of his colleagues was killed in the WTC disaster. All the more reason to bash Bush and create one of the more revealing and controversial movies of 2004.This movie exposes some shocking truths about the Bush administration and how they reacted to 9/11. It leaves some questions for the viewers to answer themselves though it answers lots of questions many Americans were just too afraid to ask.Did President Bush really win the 2000 election?-That is really one of the points that you have to decide for yourself, however you are given lots of evidence. Fox may have actually decided the fate of that election. All the other news organisations apart from Fox called Florida in favour of Al Gore thus supposedly handing him the presidency, however when Fox called Florida in the favour of Bush the other channels followed suit and Bush won the elction, however the person that called Florida in favour of Bush was actually his first cousin.Michael Moore's profile of a woman from his home-town was simply breathtaking. Lila Lipscomb from Flint, Michigan is profiled in the film because her son is in Iraq fighting. Then she finds out that her son has died and she goes to Washington and to the outside of the White House.

The burning Oil fields  after the Gulf War has been one of the most unforgiven and criminal acts in the recent story , the Alaska project and the final destiny of the wasted nuclear material could have been another winner points.May be the documental style has its own rules but I would like to know the position of some other high personalities such Tony Blair,  Jacques Chirac, Aznar , Clinton, Kissinger among others or Peace Nobel winners about this intriguing and delicate web of hidden issues which we will never reach to know in the time of our lives due the simple fact are classified information.Anyway a brave and well received film in the rest of the world -Winner in Cannes 2004- which leaves you as must be with more questions than answers due its unexhausted and arresting lines .",5,There is something rotten in Denmark !,1099699200,"11 6, 2004",2004,1877,"['film', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'Filmed', 'kinetic', 'documental', 'style', 'picture', 'delicate', 'unknown', 'powerful', 'facts', 'involved', 'Circles', 'Power', '.To', 'mind', 'film', 'peaks', 'lows', 'recruiting', 'process', 'left', 'very', 'bitter', 'taste', 'expected', 'Moore', 'was', 'far', 'premise', 'other', 'hand', 'crucial', 'events', 'such', 'secret', 'connections', 'Petroleum', 'affairs', 'implications', 'carried', 'most', 'known', '1973', 'event', 'impact', 'relation', 'necessity', 'creating', 'war', 'stages', 'hidden', 'implications', 'Financial', 'World', 'are', 'issues', 'not', 'only', 'USA', 'rest', 'globe', 'memory', 'too', 'fragile', 'sometimes', 'need', 'explain', 'certain', 'issues', 'consider', 'totally', 'fixed', 'are', 'many', 'touching', 'moments', 'bit', 'overlong', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'extremely', 'smart', 'moments', 'too', 'short', 'one', 'close', 'end', 'Moore', 'one', 'Members', 'Senate', 'requesting', 'one', 'sons', 'join', 'Iraq', 'conflict.The', 'environment', 'question', 'was', 'out', 'burning', 'Oil', 'fields', 'Gulf', 'War', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'unforgiven', 'criminal', 'acts', 'recent', 'story', 'Alaska', 'project', 'final', 'destiny', 'wasted', 'nuclear', 'material', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'winner', 'points.May', 'be', 'documental', 'style', 'own', 'rules', 'would', 'like', 'know', 'position', 'other', 'high', 'personalities', 'such', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'Jacques', 'Chirac', 'Aznar', 'Clinton', 'Kissinger', 'others', 'Peace', 'Nobel', 'winners', 'intriguing', 'delicate', 'web', 'hidden', 'issues', 'will', 'never', 'reach', 'know', 'time', 'lives', 'due', 'simple', 'fact', 'are', 'classified', 'brave', 'well', 'received', 'film', 'rest', 'world', '-Winner', 'Cannes', '2004-', 'must', 'be', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'due', 'unexhausted', 'arresting', 'lines']",Fahrenheit 9/11

629953,A2B0XO8BTPRX7R,B00005JNEI,Ian Vance,"[14, 19]","""All art is propaganda; not all propaganda is art."" - George Orwell...and in my opinion, Michael Moore's timely screed *Fahrenheit 9/11* is Art with a capital A, a near-masterpiece of skewed filmmaking in the fine tradition of *Triumph of the Will* and *Birth of a Nation*, though far more left-leaning than its predecessors.  Composed, with almost equal ratio, of damning evidence and below-the-belt circus antics; dripping with well-deserved contempt for the Bush administration; smothered with borderline-exploitative pathos and bookended by a shellshocked white-liberal's politik angst: *Fahrenheit 9/11* is immensely entertaining and highly relevant in our spin-era, and a must see for any self-respecting liberal (affirmation after affirmation for the leftest paradigm), neo-con (c'mon! Know thy Enemy, yaas?) and film-student alike.To be honest, I'm highly ambivalent of Michael Moore as a ""journalist,"" or, for that matter, a social critic.  Nor am I affiliated with one of the two political juntas that currently split the U.S.A in two: to give this review a proper perspective, let's just say I'm one of those ""moderates"" despised by both camps for not kowtowing to the prevalent rhetoric of-the-moment.  And yet, the talent that composed *Fahrenheit 9/11* cannot be denied - this man knows how to push buttons.  Scruffy and slovenly, Moore's working-class faade contrasts that of his contemporaries (Huff n' Puff blowhard Bill O'Reilly, Oxycotin spokesman Limbaugh, the pathologically perverse enigma that is Ann Coulter), but the essentials of media-manipulation remain steadfast - selective information coupled with highly-skilled editing tricks; shameless pandering; carnival-barker crowd theatrics ... but while his contemporaries tend to shovel all of the tribulations of modern society on the catch-phrase explicate ""liberal"" - lowest common denominator ad hominem expressed in the most blas&eacute; manner possible - Moore's focus here is centered upon the figurehead, the cowboy in control, the inexplicable but all too real joke that is the DUBYA.""Was it all a dream?"" Moore wonders at the beginning of the film, tickling a major sore-spot for his core audience with scenes from the 2000 election fiasco.  I have to admit that it's a guilty pleasure watching Moore take on Bush Co. with both barrels loaded and plenty of ammunition to spare; and although 9/11's cut n' paste technique is often misleading (yes, I've read the 56 deceits page), the material in itself is a damning enough portrait of greed, corruption, hubris, Wizard of Oz stylized fear-tactics, base stupidity...it's all here, folks, in voluptuous quantity.And the music cues - oh, those music cues! - Moore displays as deft a sense at the mixing board as at the editing equipment, and the result is, at times, flat-out hilarious. Bush and family cavorting at the ranch and golf course to down-home country jams - gut busting! Bush's service record underscored by a few bars of Eric Clapton's 'Cocaine' - lip-quivering!  Sinister Arabic music, reminiscent of a villain theme for a James Bond flick, to introduce a rather offensive Saudi Arabian Bush Co. connection - sheer genius! The use of sound is not just confined to the humorous, however.  The black-screen treatment of 9/11, complete with screams and destructive rumbling, is highly effective, and I was surprised Moore showed restraint and did not include footage of the dual impact or the suicide-jumpers.  The burning of Baghdad is underscored by the dirge n' strum of a soldier's favorite carnage-score: the result is jaw-dropping, a horrific example of psychological triune-stroke to motivate battle-heat; when juxtapositioned with the burnt, mutilated Iraqi corpses, it inspired in me both nausea - for the brutality of life; and admiration - for the artistic will composting the film. *Fahrenheit 9/11* continued on, relentless, thoroughly exposing Bush Co. as a plutocratic nightmare to the concept of democracy; and my outbursts of laughter at the antics became edged with a growing hysteria-tone - for this absurd theater was/is all too real, not to mention readily and rabidly defended by the meme-drenched Republican masses.Moore does fumble from time to time.  Certain segments went on too long, the African-American representative reaction being a prominent example.  The patriotic mother/slain child segment also occupied a bit too much of the running time, despite it remaining the heart of the film and its most melodramatic example of Bush Co. betrayal.  My major beef with the film, however (thus the reduction of one star) is that Moore barely scratches at the surface in regards to some of the subjects he brings up: *Fahrenheit 9/11* can easily be seen as a liberal-slander greatest hits package, with all of the accusation and little of the depth.  Still, I know Art when I see it, and Farenhight 9/11 fits the bill.  Big time.  It's status as perhaps _the_ watercooler film of the year (alongside the Catholic Guilt Catharsis of certain other independent 2004 release), when coupled with its explosive success and critical timing, is testament enough.

Perhaps Moore's critics don't understand that there is no REAL truth. Covering something from all angles, be it a war, an argument or a misunderstanding doesn't lead to pure truth, only confusion.It's no secret that Moore has an agenda with this film. And I agreed with it long before I saw it. The point is President Bush must not be re-elected. And Moore gives us hundreds of reasons why. However it's the manipulation of the editing and arranging of montages that prevent the film from having any real dignity or class. Sure there is a sense of humor and huge understanding of American politics (you MUST pay attention to every last word) but Moore's point is too biased to really connect with me. Not that I think Bush deserves any sympathy or a second (or 1, 345, 456th) chance. It's just that his intentions come across too forcefully.Yes, the war in Iraq is unjust and the biggest lie and waste of human life since the Vietnam catastrophe. And all for what? For money, nothing more than paper. If we ever come through this will we trust the Government again? Most ominously not. After watching this film will you ever trust the Government again? I promise you...you won't!There are some powerful scenes, a woman breaking down in tears reading a letter from her dead son who died in Iraq for Bush's greed, every Senator Moore meets refusing to sign their children up for the Army while poor black kids from the projects willingly sign up, the charred bodies of US soldiers being dragged through the streets in Iraq. But the most effective part of the film was also the most ingenious. The opening to Fahrenheit 9/11 plays the sounds of planes crashing into the WTC on a black screen. Powerful effects without the use of images at all. Why? We've seen it so many time we need not see it again. Because terrorism is blind. Out of respect for people sensitive for such images being exploited yet again. And to heighten our awareness of the horror of just screaming and panic and the cheapening of human life.There are parts of this film that will rile you up and enrage you, be it the skillful arranging of facts or the ignorant bystander calling the woman crying over her dead son 'staged'. Sadly though, it wanders off the point in the middle and kind of sags.If it had been leaner then I wouldn't have gotten so impatient.

629956,AOIPPEZ66R2UP,B00005JNEI,"Into ""voidness""","[8, 15]","I don't know what I can add to the nearly 1,800 reviews that are already here, but here goes...It's understandable that after experiencing the darkest side of American capitalism first hand in Flint, MI, that Michael Moore still thinks that US foreign policy is all about the money, but I sat through this whole movie waiting for him to drop the bombshell that a good chunk of what the ""neo-cons"" are about is fundamentalist Christianity...but that never came. Hell, even 60 Minutes ran a piece last year about how potentially powerful the evangelicals are, politically, in the US.There is a lot of debate going around right now as to what ""neo-conservativism"" really is, and whether or not it actually exists. I don't feel that it's too much of a mystery. Yeah, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Bush, etc. don't carry cards in their wallets saying that they are ""neo-cons,"" nor do they sport neo-con T-shirs under their shirts and ties, nor do they have a secret handshake, but there is a very real movement afoot among them and others like them; and it's purpose is to build a world in America's image: not just a world of democracy and capitalism, but a world that practices these things EXACTLY like America does; no more, no less. The tragic events of 9/11 have given them just cause, as they see it, to say, ""No more, Mr. Nice Guy,"" and bring their ideology ""out of the closet,"" to a greater degree, as if to say to the democrats, and the rest of the world, ""Okay, your way didn't work with these terrorists, so now we're going to do it OUR way""...and, in this way, the 9/11 terrorists gave them exactly the grist they needed for things like a Homeland Security Dept., ""The Patriot Act,"" and the Iraq war.There is no question in my mind that fundamentalist/evangelical Christianity is behind the neo-con movement...the only question is to what degree are they fundamentalists themselves, and to what degree are they just pandering to fundamentalist fears and values in order to secure 70,000,000 votes every election. The disorganized democratic party needs to wake up to how much political power the evangelical movement wields and how unified they are in their vision of one nation, and one world, under the Christian god. They are potentially every bit as dangerous as the fundementalist Islamic terrorists that the neo-cons have waged war against, perhaps even more so.Moore completely misses the religious aspect of the ""war on terrorism,"" making it mostly just about Saudi oil money, and I feel that as much sediment as this movie stirred up, some people just found that a little hard to believe. If he had brought up the whole ""holy war"" aspect of this conflict, it would've brought the wrath of the bible thumpers down on him (although it's hard to imagine that Moore would be intimidated by that), but it probably would've ruffled some more of the RIGHT feathers as well. Furthermore, Moore seems to get a little more ""grandstandy"" with each documentary, driving in thumbtacks with sledgehammers; and I think this tends to appeal more and more to the ""choir"" that's already on his side, and less and less to people on the fence whose minds might otherwise be changed by his movies. The ""ice cream truck loudspeaker"" bit in this movie, might've been a little much, for example. I know some pretty liberal people who think that Michael Moore's getting to be too much of a smart ass. If it gets to the point where too many people ""run and hide when they see you coming"" how effective can you be?Fundamentalist religion, and the corresponding belief that ""man""--as God/Allah's favored species--can do whatever the hell he wants here on earth, is the single biggest threat to humanity...and those of us who can still think for ourselves need to wake up to that fact, while we can still save our civilization. Organized religion has little to do with TRUE faith, or REAL spirituality.

Not only is this film significant with one of the most important elections of our time looming over us, it's also entertaining.  It's a very humorous film, mostly because George W. Bush, without meaning to be, is so utterly ridiculous. (It's been said all along that he has the best lines in the whole film!)I do want to point out, in response to many of the accusations I've been reading in these reviews, that ALL of the facts presented in this film have been proven true.  They are indisputable. Moore's opinions are his own, and he arrives at them by some evidences that Bush supporters probably wish could have stayed buried, but facts are still facts.  Yes, members of the bin Laden family were flown home 2 days after 9/11, with nothing more than a cursory passport check.  Yes, Bush really did waste 7 minutes while the country was under attack, wearing a stupid, deer-caught-in-the-headlights expression, while a grade school class read ""My Pet Goat"" and people died horribly in NYC. (He didn't want to frighten the children, he said.  He wanted to project calm.  What do most of you do during a crisis?  Do you deal with it directly, perhaps staving off more harm, or do you sit motionless, befuddled,  wondering what to do, while poor souls jump out windows of 100-story buildings rather than burn alive?) Yes, the Bush family really does have very strong ties and interests in keeping the Saudis happy.  Yes, there's a very strong parallel beetween the grieving Iraqui woman and the grieving American mother of a KIA soldier in Iraq. No, we really had no business invading a country on false pretenses.  Weapons of mass destruction, anyone?  Anyone?  Where?  Oops, made a mistake, and only 1000+ Americans have died so far while the rich (like Bush's ""base"") line their pockets further.If anything the only regret I have about this movie is that it makes me so angry. Our voting system failed us when Bush was selected 3 1/2 years ago. Please, please, rent or buy this dvd.

He makes absurd leaps in logic, and makes connections where there are none. Moore and his kind want the President to be a bumbling idiot, but at the same time, want him to be a diabolical genius capable of orchestrating 9/11, which in itself is as treasonous an accusation as there could be. It's treasonous because these people aren't just raising questions, they're making declarations.The scary part about Moore's crockumentaries is the fact that everybody will watch them and believe them despite their blatant dishonesty. People assume that documentaries are supposed to be ethical and truthful. And they ARE supposed to be; which is why Michael Moore's can't be qualified as such.The interesting thing is, if Moore really believed what he stood for was the truth, he wouldn't need to lie and distort to prove his argument.Whether its Roger and Me, Bowling for Columbine, or 9/11--he's never been fair to his topic.

Bush.  And everything in this film was contructed to instigate Dubya's donwfall.Well, let me clarify the word ""constructed"".  Most people tend to fall on either side of the fence when it comes to this movie, the conservatives would say it's all liberal propaganda, and the liberals would hail Moore as the champion of undisputed truth.  To be fair, they are both right, and they are both wrong.  If you'd just keep a clear head as you watch this movie, and do a little research yourself, you'll find that Moore does manipulate history to mislead people's thinking, but there are also areas that's been well researched and supported.  Examples: While Moore pointed out that the Bin Ladens in America were the only ones allowed to fly immediately after 9/11, they were in fact put on flights one week after normal air travels had resumed in the country; on the other hand, the Bush family's strong business ties with the Bin Ladens and the Saudis are very well documented by other sources and dates back to Bush senior.  So when I use the word ""contructed"", I don't mean Moore had gone ahead to invent fictional facts for the purpose of his political agenda, but rather, he has found a way to creatively and artistically put together the truthes and the half-truthes in a presentation against Bush.Is it a good documentary, hmm, debatable.  It's very opionated and by no means fair-handed.  Moore does build a strong case against Bush, criticising his character flaws and delivers seemingly a mountain of evidence on his questionable relationship with the Saudis.

I'm puzzled over how it is that Moore, a guy who casts himself in his own films as the underdog, now seems more like the arrogant elitists he used to lampoon so effectively. Whether or not you agree with his arguments in Fahrenheit 9/11 - and there's a lot to debate.But the Michael Moore of Roger & Me was a modest man who seemed genuinely interested in getting at the truth, along with afflicting the smug and comfortable with good humour. The Michael Moore of Fahrenheit 9/11 seems petty and vindictive, bent on not only taking down the people he disagrees with, but also humiliating them for the sheer screw-you sport of it.Moore makes some valid points in the movie about the Bush Administration's handling of the terrorism file before and after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. He asks questions - not new, but still requiring answers - about relations between the Bush family and Saudi oil interests, including the family of 9/11 terrorist Osama bin Laden. He asks, as many people do, why members of the bin Laden family were allowed to fly out of the U.S. shortly after 9/11, despite the grounding of all aircraft in the wake of the terror attacks.He thunders righteously, mainly through emotional interviews with bereaved relatives and disgruntled servicemen, about the justification for the Iraq War, which Bush and his cronies started under false pretences and continue to engage in for increasingly elusive and dubious goals.But Moore also can't seem to keep from playing the schoolyard bully. Much has been made of the found footage in Fahrenheit 9/11 that shows a stressed-out Bush inside a Florida kindergarten classroom the morning of Sept. 11, thinking for seven long minutes about how to react to an aide's whispered news that a second jet has struck the World Trade Center, and a terrorist war on America is underway.Moore also shows, repeatedly, candid views of Bush and his colleagues being made up for TV shows, as if there's something sinister about them doing exactly what politicians of every stripe - not to mention filmmakers, journalists and everyone else - do prior to making formal television appearances.He seems to want to have it both ways about everything. He paints Bush to be the dumbest U.S. president ever, but also as a diabolical schemer who stole an election and conned his countrymen into an immoral war. He claims Bush underreacted to terrorism before 9/11 (he quotes a dubious statistic that Bush was on vacation for 42 per cent of his first year in office), who then overreacted to terror after 9/11.In my opinion, the film was nothing more than propaganda.

629965,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00005JNEI,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[19, 27]","Michael Moore reinvents the pamphlet which is a genre that has widely been practised for centuries, but generally in writ (books or the press), and eventually on the radio. Michael Moore develops the genre by using the cinema as the medium carrying the pamphlet. He is able to use all possibilities offered by this medium : images, sounds, and even some special effects, but particularly elliptical editing that builds some striking and even shocking clashes between shots. This is very dynamic and effective to impress the public and to tune them to the discourse. Then he applies this mature technique to his subject to prove that George W. Bush is problematic as the President of the US for three reasons : his personality which seems to be shifting from one extreme to another and his obsession about Saddam Hussein ; the motivations and objectives of his team that seems to be aiming at only one target which is to strengthen the control of society by the state and its various agencies, and finally the dubious and non-transparent relations with the Saudis and the Ben Ladens, including his personal or family business relations with these. The objective of the documentary is to cast some doubt in the minds of the viewers about the facts and mottos that are ceaselessly repeated if not hammered in all media by all the members of this team of politicians. Finally the pamphlet insists on the very particular relations between the members of this team, first of all the President and the Vice President, with some private corporations that are making a tremendous amount of profit out of the Irak war. This is systematically contrasted with the very emotional interviews of some GIs and some parents of victims, both Iraki and American. All that makes a very strong pamphlet that will outlive the events it has been made for, the US presidential election in 2004, because of the great use of the cinema technology and techniques.

But you can see from recent gospel reviews I've evolved a lot over the past few months, and I hope that all will look at my reviews as a personal portion of the evolution of a growing black intellectual.SD 11.22.04--------I'm interested in this movie as both an art and a phenomenon at this point. Does it succeed in what it's trying to accomplish? Who's watching it? Will it affect the election? Right now if you're reading this review you're probably wondering, ""Should I see it, and what should I expect?""First, it's definitely worth seeing. It's laugh out loud funny at points. Some of the skits lead to some ""Candid Camera"" style laughs. Michael Moore standing between the Watergate, the Saudi Embassy, and the Kennedy Center gets questioned by a Secret Service agent, funny stuff. Michael Moore with a corporal trying to get Congressmen to have their children enlist. Funny reactions! The unplanned, improvised human reactions to the information he produces make you laugh and move you at the same time.Secondly, Moore does an effective job of dramatizing some of the real costs of war. The documentary footage of some of the casualties of war is tough to watch at times, especially scenes from a VA hospital with amputees. The footage of the effects of the war on the civilians of Iraq is equally disturbing. Interviews with soldiers add a real poignancy to the emotional complexities of those who have a job to serve in a war that they either do not fully understand or that has led to their disillusonment. These human stories where his subjects speak in their own voices are a valuable documentary function to appreciate the spiritual, psychological, and human toll of war.Where the movie can be attacked, however, is in his unceasing dislike for Bush and his efforts to establish conspiracy motives for much of our actions in Iraq and in the post 9/11 world. I believe his hatred of Bush, the GOP, and monied interests blind him on how to most effectively make his points. At times, Moore informs me. I learned a lot on the connections to the Saudi government with the Bushes and how political and business concerns impede an effective response to terror. But Bush is not really even a human being in this film. Sure, I hate Bush! Just about everybody left of center hates Bush! A documentary should aid to inform us about who Bush is as a character and a human being, what motivates him, and help us to understand him. A balanced portrayal of Bush would include how his Christian conversion influences his decisions as a crusader beyond a sheer paralyization to monied interests. A balanced portrait would also deal with the fact that funny money has become inherent and endemic to politicians from both sides of the political aisle as I've learned from my studies of Lyndon Baines Johnson and the Texas oil money that funded his rise to power as a champion of liberal causes. Moore spends a lot of time emphasizing how the administration manipulates Americans by an unrelenting message of fear. A conspicuous silence on this count was the total lack of mention of the very real anthrax scare and how this tangible reality of a biological attack put some flesh on the fear that drove us to war.I felt Moore got us to laugh at Bush by making him a straw man, but if Moore's goal is to elect a democratic candidate, he could have been much more convincing with either a more coherent story arc or a more human Bush.I am torn on the focus on one mother's pain at the loss of her son. Made me feel her pain; made me worry that he was exploiting her a little bit as well. But I leave that for you to determine as you watch the film.Moore's obvious liberal bias weakened the film a little bit for me, but I was entertained, periodically informed, and definitely provoked to confront some of my attitudes.Let's hope that this film sparks necessary dialogue on its strengths and weaknesses, rather than becoming a mere antiBush political rally [there will be plenty of those whether this film existed or not!]. For me, it was entertaining counterpropaganda and I encourage you to view it with an open, engaged mind.4.5 stars.--SD [late July 04]",4,"Worth the admission price, maximize impact?",1088899200,"07 4,

But some things sounded fishy and down right propaganda. Then to be fair I saw the other view ""FahrenHYPE 9/11"",and my eyes were opened wide. the same people interviewed in Fahrenheit 9/11 were also in FahrenHYPE 9/11 saying how what they said was edited and manipulated, and all the Bush footage was shown uncut so you could see what was really said and manipulated in  Michael Moore's film. I have to tell you I have never seen a film so manipulating and full of lies like Moore's film. I felt insulted and mislead. I then decided to check all the facts myself and after a deep and long finding of facts it was clear. Michael Moore's film Fahrenheit 9/11 was full of lies and manipulated facts wile ""FahrenHYPE 9/11"" was 100% true.

629976,A1ZGB8VP73DWJW,B00005JNEI,Jay,"[25, 30]","Everybody it seems has an opinion about Michael Moore and be it positive or negative most are not shy about expressing it.  So considering the already entrenched opinions held about the man, any discussion about his work will more than likely follow a predictable path and degenerate into a mud slinging exercise by the usual left and right wing suspects where any reasoned debate gets jumped on and beaten up very quickly.Fortunately ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is not a film that explores the finer points of its subject matter and can be dissected by subtle intellectual debate.  This is a wrecking ball aimed directly at President George W. Bush, his Government, personality, policies, advisers, business associates and even his family.  Moore doesn't hold back and at times his attacks on the president seem more like a personal insult than a critique of his presidency.  But then again can G.W. Bush tell the difference?  Recently, the Washington correspondent for RTE News Carole Coleman was granted a private interview with the president at the Whitehouse.  During the course of the interview Ms Coleman grilled President Bush rigorously yet respectfully about his policies, yet the president seemed to take great offence at this and repeatedly tried to brow beat the interviewer.  When one is dealing with a man who seems incapable of distinguishing between professional disagreement and personal attack, Michael Moore's tactics are not only justified, they are obligatory.Fahrenheit 9/11 grabs the audience from the beginning and moves from the tragic, to the comic, to the disturbing, to the downright frightening in a way that the viewer can't help but be pulled along with.  As with ""Bowling for Columbine"" Moore doesn't run shy from presenting the viewer with the raw pain of people directly affected by the events he rages at, the journey of Mrs Lila Lipscombe from unquestioning patriotism through doubt to anger is both tragic from a personal point of view and masterful cinema.  I truly ached for this woman's and shared her sense of betrayal, the worst part of it being as the pro war woman outside the Whitehouse said ""You're not the only one"".  Yet for all this, Moore's real anger in this film is reserved for the class divisions in American society and how this is exploited by the ruling elite to further their own agendas.  One young man's comment ""I was looking at the pictures on TV of Baghdad after the bombing and I thought we have places that look like that around here and we haven't had a war"" sums up the decline of society in the US caused by poverty and official indifference that this film rails against.This is not a documentary cast from the traditional mould where the narrator attempts to see things from all perspectives and present the user with a balanced view; this is a film that is very definitely pushing a point of view and as such criticism that the film lacks objectivity misses the point completely.  However the power of the message can't be denied.  Moore is a persuasive character and when one sees the look on Bush's face when he is told that the Nation is under attack on the morning of September 11th, that look of indecision, fear, and almost blind panic is enough to make you wonder just how much intelligence and moral fibre does this man actually have behind the public image and just what what kind of man is leading us.  Thomas Payne once said ""The patriot must always be willing to defend his country against its government"" and by this yardstick Michael Moore may have done our society a great service in making this film.  Whether you agree with the man and his politics or not, you really should see this film. The fact that there are people who are willing to make and distribute a film like this is proof that the freedoms that are our birthright, they are still alive and waiting to be reclaimed.  I can't recommend this film too highly.",5,A true act of patriotism,1089417600,"07 10, 2004",2004,3897,"['Everybody', 'opinion', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'be', 'positive', 'negative', 'most', 'are', 'not', 'shy', 'expressing', 'So', 'considering', 'already', 'entrenched', 'opinions', 'held', 'man', 'discussion', 'work', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'follow', 'predictable', 'path', 'degenerate', 'mud', 'slinging', 'exercise', 'usual', 'left', 'right', 'wing', 'suspects', 'where', 'reasoned', 'debate', 'jumped', 'beaten', 'up', 'very', 'quickly.Fortunately', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'not', 'film', 'finer', 'points', 'subject', 'matter', 'can', 'be', 'dissected', 'subtle', 'intellectual', 'debate', 'wrecking', 'ball', 'aimed', 'directly', 'President', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'Government', 'personality', 'policies', 'advisers', 'business', 'associates', 'even', 'family', 'Moore', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'times', 'attacks', 'president', 'seem', 'more', 'personal', 'insult', 'critique', 'presidency', 'then', 'again', 'can', 'G.W', 'Bush', 'tell', 'difference', 'Recently', 'Washington', 'correspondent', 'RTE', 'News', 'Carole', 'Coleman', 'was', 'granted', 'private', 'interview', 'president', 'Whitehouse', 'course', 'interview', 'Ms', 'Coleman', 'grilled', 'President', 'Bush', 'rigorously', 'yet', 'respectfully', 'policies', 'yet', 'president', 'seemed', 'take', 'great', 'offence', 'repeatedly', 'tried', 'brow', 'beat', 'interviewer', 'When', 'one', 'dealing', 'man', 'who', 'incapable', 'distinguishing', 'professional', 'disagreement', 'personal', 'attack', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'tactics', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'justified', 'are', 'obligatory.Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'grabs', 'audience', 'beginning', 'moves', 'tragic', 'comic', 'disturbing', 'downright', 'frightening', 'way', 'viewer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'pulled', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'Moore', ""n't"", 'run', 'shy', 'presenting', 'viewer', 'raw', 'pain', 'people', 'directly', 'affected', 'events', 'journey', 'Mrs', 'Lila', 'Lipscombe', 'unquestioning', 'patriotism', 'doubt', 'anger', 'tragic', 'personal', 'point', 'view', 'masterful', 'cinema', 'truly', 'ached', 'woman', 'shared', 'sense', 'betrayal', 'worst', 'part', 'being', 'pro', 'war', 'woman', 'Whitehouse', 'said', ""'re"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'Moore', 'real', 'anger', 'film', 'reserved', 'class', 'divisions', 'American', 'society', 'how', 'exploited', 'ruling', 'elite', 'further', 'own', 'agendas', 'One', 'young', 'man', 'comment', 'was', 'looking', 'pictures', 'TV', 'Baghdad', 'bombing', 'thought', 'have', 'places', 'look', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'war', 'sums', 'decline', 'society', 'US', 'caused', 'poverty', 'official', 'indifference', 'film', 'against.This', 'not', 'documentary', 'cast', 'traditional', 'mould', 'where', 'narrator', 'see', 'things', 'perspectives', 'present', 'user', 'balanced', 'view', 'film', 'very', 'definitely', 'pushing', 'point', 'view', 'such', 'criticism', 'film', 'objectivity', 'point', 'completely', 'However', 'power', 'message', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'denied', 'Moore', 'persuasive', 'character', 'when', 'one', 'look', 'Bush', 'face', 'when', 'told', 'Nation', 'attack', 'morning', 'September', '11th', 'look', 'indecision', 'fear', 'almost', 'blind', 'panic', 'enough', 'make', 'wonder', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'intelligence', 'moral', 'fibre', 'man', 'actually', 'have', 'public', 'image', 'just', 'what', 'what', 'kind', 'man', 'leading', 'Thomas', 'Payne', 'once', 'said', 'patriot', 'must', 'always', 'be', 'willing', 'defend', 'country', 'government', 'yardstick', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'may', 'have', 'done', 'society', 'great', 'service', 'making', 'film', 'agree', 'man', 'politics', 'not', 'really', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'fact', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'make', 'distribute', 'film', 'proof', 'freedoms', 'are', 'birthright', 'are', 'still', 'alive', 'waiting', 'be', 'reclaimed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'too', 'highly']",Fahrenheit 9/11

This is a fearless man.The reason this review misses two stars is there was something strange with the delivery of this movie. It deffinately clouds  the mind with emotion. For instance the begining of this movie begins with the haunting audio of the chaos and confusion on the streets of NY just moments after the attack so immediately my heart sank straight to my stomach. Then we see President Bush's reaction when the news was delivered to him during a visit to an elementry school in the middle of a book, which he sits, visibly confused, and decides to continue the story he began with the children and yes, perhaps he could have, or should have, explained to the children that the president is a busy man and apologize for his must needed departure. Then again this is a man who can barely speak infront of adults, would he have sent these children into a panic had he actually opened his mouth? Perhaps he made the best possible decision that he, himself, could handle. Michael Moore made too big a deal out of this in my opinion, and I am NOT defending the President, and I would be the last to.Visually, this movie will break your heart, frustrate and anger you. From the Iraqi man holding the deceased baby, the greif and sorrow of the woman whose son was killed in battle, the story of the Iraqi American being detained in the prisons. Yes, these are unjust,horrible and shameful crimes. I was and am appauled. I walked around for days frustrated all over again as I was after 9/11, after the start of the war and after his re-election (which I was no part of). Then I watched a few other documentaries reguarding the Bush administration, one that stands out is Mark Crispin Miller's A Patriot Act and something dawned on me. From a Patriot act I walked away pretty informed, from Fahrenheit 9/11 I walked away really mad and upset. Did Michael Moore just pull on me what he claims to despise and blame the media for, and that is cramming my eyes with the blood soaked footage of the war and 9/11 to make an opinion for me as the news delivers unfavorable images of minorities and people of poverty to make panic and opinions for those who are ignorant to circumstance? For profit? I'm not saying he's wrong in what he's ""saying"", he is very right. However,I dislike a hypocrite, and apparantly no one knows an American like Michael Moore. So let's be careful.I do give him great credit for his fairness to the military. At first you'll be horrified to see some Marines blood thirsty, ready and excited to fight and kill and at the music they listen to while in battle.

First off I am not a liberal, I did not vote for Gore and I do not plan on voting for Kerry, neither did I vote for Bush (I voted Libertarian but that is not the point).  I am a former film student and someone who reads about and cares about the making of film, I like Moors other films, the big one, Roger and Me and Bowling for Columbine (which was better then F 911 in my opinion).  Let us go back, way back to one of the first documentary films, Nanook of the north (spelling)? It was, we were told, a story of an Eskimo family and there day to day survival, it was also, by the directors own admission, a big lie.  The family were not a family at all, they were cast, they took the prettiest among the tribe and cast them as a family, the ""hunt"" was staged, this was a work of fiction, the only difference was the lack of professional actors.  News flash folks, all documenters are like this. The filmakers have a vision, shoot a lot of footage in carefully selected times and places, and then assemble it to make there point, people have gotten the false notion that documenters are supposed to be neutral and unbiased, haw they arrived at such a foolish conclusion is beyond me.  If Rush Limbaugh had made a documentary I can assure you Bush would have looked entirely different.  It is not the story it is the story teller. Everyone knows, or should know, Moores take on George W Bush, this film should be no surprise.  As for the reviews talking about ""Lies"", I did not see this.  Bin Laudins family disowned him long before 911, of course his relatives were flown out of harms way, they are our allies and we need them like we need the rest of the muslim world, who were as shocked and outraged as anyone, many Muslims died on 911. Does that mean he's telling a lie?  No.  He is just telling us carefully selected bits of truth.  Only one member of congress has a son or daughter in Iraq, welcome to planet earth Mr. Moore, how many members of congress had sons on Vietnam?  About the same.  Business as usual.  It is the responsiblity of all of us as film fans to learn as much as we can and demand better films.

This film is not an account of what happened on that terrible day in history, but the shock waves it made, which today still can be felt. If you have read either Dude Wheres My Country or Stupid White Men you would have felt like you have seen this film, as it is just both books made into a film really. The film starts with the 2000 elections in the apparent 'Most Democratic Country in the World' where Bush lost the vote but still became president. The moment where citizens of Florida ask for it to be put right but cannot get a single signature from the Senate, just filled me with anger, how can the people of america allowed Bush to wim, it disgusts me still.The rest of the film is really what a job Bush has done, making America the least respected country in the world. I should know, I am british and live in the UK, and me my friends, my parents, my grandparents and on all TV programs mock President Warlord Bush. If Bush is dum, how dum is america to elect him?The facts presented in the film are true, however they are biast so we only hear Moore's side of the argument. The film made me laugh at moments like Bush's one liners and the equipment to help yourself in a terroist attacks. Moments of the film are alos heart breaking, like the mothor of a child who was killed in Iraq over a qar over oil.Overall I thought this was an excellent film, better then  Bowling for Columbine.

It created enormous controversy earlier in 2004 when it was released. The DVD version, coming out just a month before the presidential election, is likely to exhume the same emotions that surfaced this spring.""Fahrenheit"" is not a perfect movie. Moore's approach is to illustrate his points via stunts, not all of which work. Cornering US reps to get their kids to join to the military makes the point that reps are not terribly willing to put their own families on the line in the war on terror. But then, few Americans have had to sacrifice (yet) in this war. Though it has its moments of humor and absurdity, ""Fahrenheit"" is more frightening than funny; the stakes are too high. While it may be humorous to hear Congressman Charles Dingell ""lecture"" Moore about how our reps don't read the bills that come before them, it's pretty frightening that this is the case. The Patriot Act -- rushed through Congress with barely a reading and barely a debate -- being a case in point.That being said, Moore does provide us with well-executed (and frightening) snapshots of early-21st century America and its top leadership. Watching President Bush sit for 7 long minutes while reading ""My Pet Goat"" to a bunch of gradeschoolers said a lot about his purported leadership abilities. Witnessing the enormous protests in Washington at Bush's Inauguration made me wonder why I had not seen these images before. Seeing a mother, who had lost a son in Iraq, assailed in Washington, DC by a true Bush believer spoke volumes about the desire of many citizens to maintain their rosy view of Bush ""values"" and policies in the face of contrary evidence. Hearing American soldiers screaming in agony after an attack brought home the human cost of the war, which has been suppressed by our leaders. Listening to an Oregon State Trooper describing the budget cuts that have left a long swath of coastline unprotected brought home the degree to which Bush has actually left our homeland less secure than before the 9/11 attacks.There's no doubt that Moore is a polemicist -- he is trying to influence the thinking of Americans who would rather not believe the duplicity and danger of the current administation. But being a polemicist doesn't make you a liar, as many of Moore's detractors would have us believe. ""Fahrenheit 911"" is an important addition to the currently muffled voice of protest and truth.

629986,A2L4ZGN7GZJ95T,B00005JNEI,Jed Shlackman,"[16, 45]","Michael Moore has built his reputation on exposing corporate misdeeds and government corruption.  This movie is an obvious attack on Bush, but one that fails to provide much investigation into what really happened to facilitate the events of 9-11 and America's descent into fascism.  Also, Moore represents a voice for the communist-socialist critique of fascism (fascism being nationalist-socialist) - a tyranny that professes to be benevolent challenging one that appears elitist and arrogant.  Moore starts off with the 2000 election, displaying sympathy for the Al Gore cause (which is not a way to start a documentary if you wish to appear objective).  As he moves into 9-11 and its aftermath, he has a lot of entertaining and heart-wrenching material to lay on the viewer.  Moore is clever at putting together music, video, and voice overs to create a compelling story in this way.  However, he fails to present a lot of evidence about government complicity and elite agendas which can be found in independently distributed documentaries that have been produced about 9-11.  Moore's film only scratches the surface of a dark, disturbing story, and allows the viewers to think they have now been informed about Bush & 911 and that the situation can be improved by going out to vote for Bush's Democratic election opponent, a member of the same secret society and elite network that pull Bush's strings.

Munson,"[10, 17]","I was a little apprehensive about viewing this film, but after watching it, I must say that my eyes have been opened a little wider than before.  As a staunch Bush supporter, I was afraid that Moore was going to slam him and his policies unmercifully, but instead, he provides stimulating ""food for thought"".  For example, I found his analysis of Andrew Card's informing Bush of the attack on the World Trade Center very disturbing.  I didn't know that Bush sat in the classroom for almost ten minutes before doing anything.  That is simply unacceptable, even to a die-hard Republican such as myself.I found Moore's analysis of the Iraq war to be very interesting.  The interviews with the soldiers and family members were especially emotional, especially in the case of Lila Lipscomb, who tearfully reads a letter she received from her son just days before he was killed in a Blackhawk helicpoter crash.  Other scenes, such as the soldier describing the type of music that they liked to listen to when going on attack (""Let the mother#@%^& burn!"") was very disturbing to me.  Finally, being a parent myself, the scenes of the dead Iraqi children were especially difficult to watch.There are many items pointed out in the film that I had no idea about, especially the Bush family link to Saudi oil, and how members of the Bin Laden family were allowed to leave the United States after the terrorist attacks, even though all flights in the United States had been banned.Moore also looks at the disputed 2000 presidential election and claims that George W. Bush was elected by his father's""friends on the Supreme Court"".  The errors of the networks in projecting a winner in Florida on election night is also looked at.I have been and always will be a Bush supporter, but I must admit that this film has opened my eyes more about him and revealed things that I didn't know before.  I thought that this was a very thought-provoking film and it did a very good job at explaining Bush's past and some of the events in his presidency that may have been handled incorrectly.  Moore also manages to add a little humor, such as when Bush and his cabinet members are being made up for television, or when John Ashcroft tries his hand at a singing career.  I highly recommend this film.

This movie is so much more than a documentary it's a Classic. As the disc loads, and the menu screen becomes active, you notice music(somber) and then you realize the menu is showing a clip on the morning of 9-11. A trusted man walks to the president, and whispers in his ear. you watch over the next few minutes (as the president seems to age quickly before your eyes) ,him sit before the classroom. The is the tone of the movie. It brings up new questions. This movie was once asked why it was not stricken from the public. Seen as bush bashing. It rather, stands as a sign of freedom. A chance for information to be heard and proud to partake in. The second act of the movie, the first covers curiosites and political scandles, is the side of the story that couldn't be told before. At first, you follow the trampling of Saddams Armies, The confidence of our troops. Moore steals this confidence with ducumentation of Occupied Iraq. A soldier stumbles and is devoured in a plum of dust and fire. Quickly, after watching the hate build in the cities, the nightly raids by our troops, I see the familiarities with vietnam. One young soldier covered in dust exclaiming, ""I hate this place, I hate this war."" Then you see the confidence replaced with anger, as you follow the documentation of cruel treatment to prisoners by our own. ""thers nothing different from this war and Vietnam, The government was saying the same thing."" This was a statement that stuck in my head for awhile, one of many.

Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[2, 5]","If you had the money to make a movie about something that really makes you angry, would you be of sound mind and objective opinion to do it fairly and equaly?  This is a question that everyone should ask themselves before watching (or even after watching) Fahrenheit 9/11.  Realistically Michael Moore is a blowhard; an extremely left wing French culture loving, untrusting soul who is obviously has a beef with any Conservative politician, George Bush in particular.  In essence, I feel sorry for him that he is not able to take a realistic look at the world around us and see why some things are happening.Obviously, I am not a Michael Moore fan, however I am not a Bush fan either.  I accept that he is our President and it is my right to say that I think he has made many mistakes in his first term.  History will tell us if his next term is redeeming or damning.  However, Moore is a man who is lucky enough to make movies where he can shuffle is opinion to everyone with a mix of fact and a large dose of innuendo.  Listen to this movie CAREFULLY!  Many statements Moore delivers are simply questions, questions with no answers but his innuendo pushes the element of conspiracy and hidden agendas.I don't believe the first scene with the woman who's son was killed in Iraq is true.  I think that's way too expedient for him to find a staunch Republican who is so in favor of Bush to suddenly do a 180 and question the administration...just within the time he was making his movie.  Hmm, that's awfully convenient.There are many questions that Moore states in his movie that I WOULD like answers to; why were the Bin Laden's flown out of the country under secretive circumstances.  Why did Haliburton get a multi billion dollar no-bid contract?  Why, to this day, have we concentrated so much effort on Iraq when Bin Laden is in Afghanistan?  Why didn't the members of Congress read the Patriot act before voting on it?The movie is fairly entertaining, but a little too long.  I won't debate the true facts of the movie, of which there aren't many.  I was aware of almost all the truths displayed, but when Moore delivers them with a self righteous, pompous, all-knowing attitude, I don't feel compelled to listen.  I am objective and I ask questions, I don't like jumping to conclusions.

629996,A3IH2L4B5VOA59,B00005JNEI,"J. Houzet ""wozamoya""","[33, 101]","Let's address some of the deceit and malice in this movie: First off, Moore repeats the tired liberal canard that Bush stole the 2000 election. Come on now, we all know Gore and the Dems tried to flout electoral law to continue the recounts long after this was permitted. And even an independent recount by the AP, Tribune Media and other press months after the election proved that Bush still got more votes in Florida than Gore did. Right-thinking people know unscrupulous Dems hoped to steal that election through so-called ""recounts"" as well as disenfranchising military voters, which were more likely to be Republican.Moore tries to make President Bush and his staff look bad or just silly over and over in this crockumentary. It would be very easy to follow Kerry and Edwards on their campaign trail and get similar footage, should some conservatives be so inclined to gather unused footage from the media and do some sneak filming of their own. But that would just be childish. Moore makes a big deal out of Bush's so-called lack of immediate response to the WTC attacks while in that classroom, ridiculing him for his silence and continuing to read to the elementary school kids. What would Moore have liked Bush to do - declare war on someone immediately, perhaps bomb the Saudis? Bush is merely displaying the human reaction: the shock and numbness many of us felt watching those planes hit the towers. I admire President Bush - he displays the calm of a man in trying times, mourning the loss of lives and speaking with peace and gentleness to innocent little children.Moore ridicules Bush for issuing a warning to terrorists in between a game of golf. What Moore does not reveal is how this was not a sign of laxity prior to 9/11 or a casual response to 9/11, but rather a response when Bush was asked about the continued terror attacks against Israel! Tricky editing by Moore to get the reaction he desires.Moore faults the marine recruiters for sticking to lower-income areas. Hey, this is reality, folks. The army, navy, marines, etc, know where the most likely recruits come from. The armed forces provide many people with jobs, scholarships and opportunities to study they might not otherwise have. Moore would have something to talk about if this was CONSCRIPTION - if the marines were conscripting ONLY lower income people and minorities. But the US has PROFESSIONAL armed forces - this is a CAREER for the people who sign up. Some people seem to naively believe that soldiers will not have to see armed conflict, like the deserters who said they didn't know they would have to kill people. If you don't want to take the chance you might have to kill someone one day, DON'T sign up for the military! I am thankful for our soldiers who make this hard choice to be soldiers and who are proud to be soldiers. In any event, Moore misrepresents the armed forces as being made up of minorities in disproportionate numbers. This is simply not true. The demographic make-up of the armed forces represents real America; therefore most soldiers are actually white. Surprised?Moore tries to use images of wounded soldiers and Iraqi civilians to make people become anti-war. This is just fuel for the crowd that is already anti-war. Such images will always be hard to look at, but we know there is a war on and these are the casualties, it does not make this war less just or diminish our resolve that justice will prevail. Moore and other media weren't around to capture on film the horrors Saddam perpetrated on his people, and he didn't even bother to speak to Iraqis with stories to tell of how they suffered under Saddam and Moore didn't bother to use footage of the mass graves uncovered by US soldiers.At other times Moore uses footage of young troops that attempts to paint American soldiers as casual killers. He makes no attempt to display the courage in battle and compassion to the Iraqi people most of these soldiers have shown. Same with the images from Abu Ghraib prison. They were repeatedly shown and talked about by the media in an effort to portray ALL our soldiers as being heartless barbarians and as though this was official policy. And yet, scant attention was paid to the beheadings perpetrated by the Islamic militants. The difference between American outrage and outrage in the Islamic world is that the soldiers guilty of torture at Abu Ghraib will be punished, but there is hardly a peep about the MURDER of captives at the hands of the Islamic militants.There is more tricky editing Moore does for the best manipulation. Moore actually only met and filmed Lila Lipscomb AFTER her son was already killed. The ""transformation"" you saw take place in her political attitude was carefully edited to appear the loss of a son changed her view on the war. It actually took place months after she first heard the news of her son's death. I don't know Mrs. Lipscomb's mind, but I can fathom grieving mothers being devastated by the loss of their children to war. Many, many mothers lost their sons who were fighting Hitler, Mussolini and Tojo, but they didn't suddenly suggest the war wasn't worth it. Likewise, Moore COULD have interviewed parents who have lost children in Iraq but still feel the cause is just. Moore does not do this because it does not help HIS cause.I'm glad Fox News and other sources revealed how Moore carefully edited his encounters with members of Congress, when he tried to get them to sign up their kids to serve in Iraq. When one congressman said he in fact had several family members serving in Iraq, Moore deftly left that part on the cutting room floor, as well as his jibe, to get the desired walk-away effect that he retained.(...)",1,The most contemptible film ever made?,1089676800,"07 13, 2004",2004,5692,"['Let', 'address', 'deceit', 'malice', 'movie', 'First', 'off', 'Moore', 'tired', 'liberal', 'canard',

That its main target is richly deserving of our contempt and mockery does not change the fact that this film is intellectually incoherent, contradictory and too full of baseless assertions, fatuous ""reasoning"" and downright untruths. The sole fact that he completely ignored the dominant role of Israeli-loyalist neoconservatives in starting the war is reason enough to discount the whole movie. I'm as big an opponent of the president as there is, but let's get a few things straight: he did not steal the 2000 election by disenfranchising black voters in Florida. A bunch of idiots who weren't on the voting rolls because they hadn't voted in 10 years, were felons, went to the wrong voting district, or who were never registered to begin with got mad because they couldn't pollute the system with their illegal votes. The Bush family may be too close to the Saudis, but that didn't cause 9/11 and it wasn't Bush who allowed the bin-Laden family out of the country after 9/11- it was Bush's nemesis Richard Clarke, who only did so after the FBI said that they were not suspects. And if Bush were such a puppet of the Saudis, why did he invade Iraq against the vehement opposition of those same Saudis? And the way Moore portrays it, it's only the poor defenseless black kids who are being victimized by slick and dishonest military recruiters- it's actually rural white kids who are disproportionately represented on the front lines of this war. The military cannibals will take their prey wherever there is poverty and lack of opportunites. No, the real power of this film is in its images, not Moore's discombobulated attempt to fit them all together into a coherent whole. The look on our idiot's president's face as he sat dumbfounded in that Florida classroom for 7 minutes on 9/11 is worth the price of admission(even though I actually bought a ticket to Spider Man and snuck into Fahrenheit to avoid supporting Moore). The scenes of Iraqi atrocities, Bush's arrogance and juvenility, and the unctuous Congressman's reaction when Moore suggested having his son enlist are also great ones. This propaganda movie isn't going to contribute to general enlightenment. It will provoke Bushies, and serve as red meat for lefties, but it will certainly influence the moron majority for whom this film will serve as their only source of information on the state of our country.

And maybe you got tired of it, and decided,  sincethis is my high school too, though I don't have wealthyparents, and am not the captain of the football team, I'lltell someone. I will rat them out. But, no. Too scared.You think maybe being a non entity is a good deal. I afterall am not bullying anyone, or  lying about people. I'm notcheating on my exams. It will come back to haunt thebullies. Because you believe in justice You hear aboutthings being for a reason. You hear that if you are goodand don't curse or drink or smoke, or hurt other people,you're OK.But the bullies drink and smoke. And think nothing abouthurting other people. They kind of enjoy it.  Some of themdrink and smoke a lot. You think it's so transparent. I seethe results of their bullying and getting away with it.Where is the justice?And you think: If I  was mean enough, or if only I had arich daddy. If only I didn't have to study hard or at all,and teachers still passed me to the next grade? So you gohome at night and you study three or four hours, then youcontinue reading a book before school interrupted youfrom real books and learning real stuff. Books like""1984,"" ""Fahrenheit 451,"" ""Johnny Got His Gun,"" ""BraveNew World,"" or ""All Quiet on the Western Front."" Andyou maybe want to talk about them in English lit. classbecause you've grown tired of the sanitized stuff in thetext book. But you know your thoughts are suspect.When did this happen? As you discover there are an awfullot of bullies around. And they aren't all in school. Andthey are not terribly bright. You just know they will makeit in the world. You just know they will get away withanything.You read later Bertrand Russell's definition of howschools make ""manly men"" and how those ""manly men""die on battlefields, not knowing why, and it all has to dowith school, and learning to play the game and not earnthe enmity of ""fools."" And maybe some of these ""manlymen"" who were bullies (the ones without money, who didnot get daddy to buy them out of the draft) got killed inbattle. War turned out not like another high schoolfootball game after all. And yet, isn't this what MichaelMoore is saying? That it all starts then? That if everyonewill be a patriot to their school, things will be okay?Newsies don't ask hard ball questions of certain bulliesanymore. They just have their hair blow dried properly,their make up done well, and they sit in front of a cameraand they read what someone wrote for them. And it's all ahigh school setting. And that's where we are. Only it's abillion times worse. A thousand American soldiers aredead. Ten or more thousand innocent Iraqis. And fewbeen saying anything for such a long time. Just hot air.Just noise. Katie Couric thinks ""Navy SEALS rock""however.If Michael Moore has to have courage to make this film,if people have to have courage to go see it, or to tellothers about it, and not to have ""propaganda"" tossed intheir faces by  people who are so well, informed, they'venot seen it, or any of his other movies, or have not readany of his books, then it seems the big quiet is on. Or was.I happened to like my high school. And it made me madbeyond words when one of the bullies was graduated likeall the rest of us even though his term paper for Englishwas copied word for word from his sister's term paper afew years before when she was in the same class with thesame teacher. The teacher nailed him right there before us.Threw the paper right at him. Furious. Said he would notgraduate. She lied. Or was told to graduate him. Whichshe did.It always takes courage to tell the truth. To have the facts.To do the job the news has abdicated itself from in suchcowardice. That is what is called freedom. It takes nocourage to do nothing and pretend you do not see whatyou see, or do not hear what you hear.Death is not ""Hoppy Rides the Range:"" circa 1943.  Ididn't have to go fight a war though. I did not have tolose a son in a war. I did not have to receive that horriblephone call announcing with regrets....I didn't have to havechildren die in my arms. I didn't have to have my friendblown to bits beside me. I didn't have to have an arm orleg amputated. I didn't have to have my guts blown outand me with a bag on my side the rest of my life. I didn'thave to die for something that was not so.Moore reminds us that right now, right this second,someone is being cut apart by bullets, someone is beingblown to bits by a bomb, someone, a child, for instance, iscrying in her sleep because there is nothing but a screamleft in her, in a tent hospital somewhere in the Mid East,and that scream is one heck of a lot more important, thangoing along, than just hoping it doesn't touch you,because it will, eventually.Michael Moore says so. Well, passionately, with the factsto back him up. And for anyone not obsessed with doingthe second grade versions of the dozens on him becauseof his physical characteristics, that should be the thing thatcounts. Please see this movie. Facts are facts. And he hasthe talent, the tenacity, the compassion, the humanity totell us so. And make me, for one, a little ashamed at howquiet I've been. It's time we graduate.",5,The temperature at which freedom catches fire and burns,1097020800,"10 6, 2004",2004,5363,"['Remember', 'high', 'school', 'bullies', 'rich', 'ones', 'wasnothing', 'could',

630003,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00005JNEI,Joe Sherry,"[29, 43]","A film by Michael MooreMichael Moore has stated from the start what ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is and what it is intended to be.  The film is an attack on President Bush about his handling of our country and his actions after September 11, 2001.  The film is an indictment for his entire presidency and President Bush's failure to truly ""lead"" our nation.  Michael Moore has had no hidden agenda.  His agenda with this film has been quite public.  He wants to educate the public about President Bush and he wants President Bush out of office.  Moore is using this documentary as a platform against President Bush and he is open about it.  All documentaries, whether or not the director is open about it, have a certain amount of bias.  I'm not sure it is possible to not show bias and still have a quality film that makes a point.  Moore is just less subtle about his bias than most.Since this is a documentary, there are three things that must be taken into consideration:1. Is this a well made, quality piece of filmmaking?2. Is this movie entertaining?3. Is the documentary factual?The first two questions are common to all movies.  The third question is directed towards a documentary.  I do not have the expertise to answer question 3, but I can say that many of the arguments Moore makes in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" are ones that I have heard before, often from reputable sources, so I am inclined to accept the veracity of the facts presented in this movie.  The facts may be accurate, but is Moore's interpretation truthful?Michael Moore opens ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" with the 2000 election and the claims that George W Bush, with the help of his brother and the official vote counter of Florida, cheated to win the election.  Moore goes onto show the viewer how Bush always intended to invade Iraq, even before September 11, even if there was no connection between Iraq and the particular terrorists who were to blame.  Moore continues to show the connection between Bush's family and the Bin Ladin family (which is not the same thing as a connection directly with Osama) and how numerous members of the Bin Laden family were allowed to leave the United States without being questioned only two days after the 9/11 attacks.  It is Moore's contention that President Bush has been a failure as President, but worse, has been damaging to our country and to the world.Right now I have no reason to doubt the facts presented in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", but it is Moore's interpretation of the facts that point to a larger conspiracy among everyone in the administration to fight the war in Iraq no matter the provocation (or a lack thereof).  It is Moore's interpretation that says that President Bush deliberately manipulated America with the fear of post 9/11 that has allowed him to fight a war that nobody would have supported otherwise.  I'll admit that Moore makes a compelling and powerful case, but I'm not sure how much I am yet willing to accept all of his interpretations.One thing is clear to me, however.  ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is a skillfully made political film that far surpasses any of the political advertisements that you see on television that are ""approved"" by the candidate.  ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is deeply moving, often funny, and is a well made, well crafted film.  It goes without saying that this is a very divisive film and perhaps the viewer's enjoyment of it (or even acceptance of it) may very well depend on what side of the political spectrum one finds himself (or herself).

Hoping to help other loyal, concerned Americans bring the Bush Administration to a hardly untimely end on January 20, 2005, Moore documents the perfidious nature of the crooks and warmongers who have misgoverned us since the Supreme Court stabbed us in the back after the 2000 Election.The movie begins with the last, triumphant days of the Al Gore Campaign as it swept toward victory in November of 2000.  Moore then documents the shenanigans and insider dealings which produced the Florida fiasco and installed Bush and Company in the White House.  Moore does an especially brilliant job of documenting the sleazy tactics and underhandedness of W and his milieu, which includes some of the smarmiest people in the Middle East and Europe.Next, Moore shows us W. on September 11, 2001, sitting with a glazed look on his face as his world began to crumble.  Moore demonstrates that far from being the courageous, calm leader Republican propagandists portray, W. in the days and weeks after September 11 was more of a pawn than a king.The most powerful parts of Fahrenheit 911 deal with the tragic war in Iraq in all its bloody details, details that the US media has never had the stomach to show us but which are essential to our understanding of exactly what our government is committing in our names. Moore also shows us exactly which Americans are doing the fighting and dying:  not the privileged sorts who run the government, but the poorest and saddest among us.Fahrenheit 911 is a muckraker's delight.  It claws away our illusions and demonstrates that the Emperor has no clothes and that our ""gods"" have feet of clay.",5,Michael Moore Punctures the Bush Balloon,1095984000,"09 24, 2004",2004,1706,"['Fahrenheit', '911', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'contribution', '2004', 'Presidential', 'Campaign', 'Hoping', 'help', 'other', 'loyal', 'concerned', 'Americans', 'bring', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'hardly', 'untimely', 'end', 'January', '20', '2005', 'Moore', 'documents', 'perfidious', 'nature', 'crooks', 'warmongers', 'who', 'have', 'misgoverned', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'stabbed', 'back', '2000', 'Election.The', 'movie', 'last', 'triumphant', 'days', 'Al', 'Gore', 'Campaign', 'swept', 'victory', 'November', '2000', 'Moore', 'then', 'documents', 'shenanigans', 'insider', 'dealings', 'produced', 'Florida', 'fiasco', 'installed', 'Bush', 'Company', 'White', 'House', 'Moore', 'especially', 'brilliant', 'job', 'documenting', 'sleazy', 'tactics', 'underhandedness', 'W', 'milieu', 'smarmiest', 'people', 'Middle', 'East', 'Europe.Next', 'Moore', 'W.', 'September', '11', '2001', 'sitting', 'glazed', 'look', 'face', 'world', 'began', 'crumble', 'Moore', 'far', 'being', 'courageous', 'calm', 'leader', 'Republican', 'portray', 'W.', 'days', 'weeks', 'September', '11', 'was', 'more', 'pawn', 'king.The', 'most', 'powerful', 'parts', 'Fahrenheit', '911', 'deal', 'tragic', 'war', 'Iraq', 'bloody', 'details', 'details', 'US', 'media', 'never', 'had', 'stomach', 'show', 'are', 'essential', 'understanding', 'exactly', 'what', 'government', 'committing', 'names', 'Moore', 'also', 'exactly', 'Americans', 'are', 'doing', 'fighting', 'dying', 'not', 'privileged', 'sorts', 'who', 'run', 'government', 'poorest', 'saddest', 'us.Fahrenheit', '911', 'muckraker', 'delight', 'away', 'illusions', 'Emperor', 'clothes', 'gods', 'have', 'feet', 'clay']",Fahrenheit 9/11

This film not only opened my eyes, but confirmed my suspicions about why the Hell we were attacking the country of Iraq. There are murderous dictators, and atrocities happening in countries in Africa on a daily basis, as well as our own back yard of Haiti, and drug lords running rampant all over South America, and infiltrating our streets with Crack Cocaine and Smack. But we dont declare war on them, we do nothing, but send our regards. Why, you ask? Well, I can GUARANTEE you that if the country of Haiti had the 2nd largest Oil Reserves on the Planet, that we would have already invaded it, deposed the leader, and stuck a US Flag in the center of the Capital of Port Au Prince, thats for damned sure.George Dubya Redneck, the real life J.R. Ewing, and his sidekick Dick Cheney have, shall we say ""business interests"" in all that Black Gold/Texas Tea that Saddam Hussein was sitting on so smugly. Could they and Halliburton get to it with Saddam there? No Way, Jack! BUT, after 9/11 happened, this opened the floodgates, all of a sudden they had all the excuse they needed, the fear of the American People to inexplicalbly declare war on a country that had ZILCHO to do with 9/11. And now, except for those damned insurgents, George Dubya has his foot in the door, and is on the verge of being a billionaire once he hands the reins over to Dick. And if it costs over 1,000 US troops, well, thats just tough, and the Dept. of Defense will send their sympathies and regrets, oh, and they wont forget to dock your precious sons or daughters pay for those last few days when they were in a body bag, after all they only get paid for killing Iraqis, not ""lying down on the job""....This film made me disgusted, especially when they showed US Troops a little too happy about burning down homes.

From what I see and hear on most of FOX News and the like, the only discussions from neocon pundits, including Ann Coulter, Joe Scarborough and Sean Hannity, center around name calling and portraying Moore as an anti-patriot who is aiding the terrorists without effectively deconstructing the perceived merits and flaws of Moore's documentary.I do agree that this film is slanted, but the so-called extenuating circumstances that critics have tried to espouse in defense of the Bush White House hold very little weight. And who are these critics? Again, Coulter and company.Don't get me wrong. There are annoyances from the leftist view, but when you have guys like Savage, Hannity and Limbaugh espousing their venom under the guise of news talk radio, leaving little room, if any, for other points of view, perhaps for those other opinions to receive any undivided, uninterrupted attention this documentary had to come out.I often wish that we could have some scholarly, well-informed, well-balanced discussions on a regular basis. I think that the conservatives would serve themselves well if they had more of the intelligent analysts like George Will, William Buckley, and Bill Kristol. They might not be the most exciting, but they do not go off foaming at the mouth, indoctrinating one-half of a nation that they have, in essence, divided.Oh, yes. Our nation is divided. It does not help when you watch programs where the so-called moderator allows one guest to voice, essentially, the moderator's sentiments in full and then join this first guest in double-teaming against the dissenting party, not allowing this second guest to complete the first two sentences without being interrupted. Again, I think that what has been happening on certain programs on MSNBC, CNBC, FOX, and various outlets has contributed to the popularity of Fahrenheit 911, because it is one rare source that one can hear some degree of satire about President Bush.There were promises of uniting as opposed to dividing, but this juvenile attitude that one is so much more entitled to put others down than the next person is creating a rift. It especially is troublesome when idealogues are so full of themselves that they communicate as if they do not have to heed the facts, especially if the facts do not agree with their perceived standards.

The new book ""The 9-11 Investigations"" has the sworn testimony of Richard Clarke and George Tenet and Condy Rice and Madelline Albright and the reports from the Staff and this information is very informative.If anything Moore's movie will affect so many individuals to decide how they view President Bush, the USA, the War on Terror, Iraq, etc.  One thing that caught my attention about 9-11 in the investigations it was found that even if Bin-Laden had been killed or captured prior to 9-11 it would not have prevented it according to the investigation.  Moore may feel they are all 'in on it' but anyone watching these investingations know that there was a real attempt to find out whether anyone was negligent prior to the event.Is the President responsible?  If so, why did the investigation not turn that up?  Is Moore being truthful with us, is that not important to all Americans or do we pick and choose what we believe because we 'choose to believe it?'Moore's previous movies have had a tendency to exaggerate.  He is funny, but does he really have our best interest in mind when he makes movies and writes books that villify?  He calls Americans in general, you and me, stupid.

Menta, Jr.","[20, 22]","Sadly, even in light of how the Iraq situation seems to get worse and worse each day, there are still many people who say, ""Oh, I won't see that Michael Moore film... I hear it's really biased.""  I wish these folks would smack themselves on the head and realize that administration officials have been feeding everyone THEIR side of the story for three-plus years, so what's WRONG with hearing an opposing view for a lousy TWO HOURS?  I'm not saying you need to agree with every single point Mr. Moore makes here, but what's so crazy about viewing the darned thing once before giving it a blanket dismissal?Just be warned, viewers may find precious little to refute in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", as Mr. Moore makes so many of his points by simply letting the president speak for himself, via the ample newsclips that were assembled for the film.  One of my favorites is the quote in the subject line, which Mr. Bush delivered to a roomful of fat-cat campaign contributors during a lavish fundraising dinner.  Actually, the entire quote is even more revealing: ""Ah, the haves and have-mores... some people call you the elite... I call you my base.""  And not only does the quote confirm Mr. Moore's assertions about who the president is truly ""for"", but it also raises (yet again!) questions about the leader of the free world's mental agility, in that he actually allowed those comments to be videotaped!But, hey, if you still need another reason to watch this movie, it's also very, very funny in places.  And, of all forms of humor, political humor is always particularly fun, isn't it?  Also, the humor gives one occasional breaks from the serious, heart-rending, and tragic moments in the film, which I have to be honest and say are also here in abundance.That's it for now.

Mr. Moore has a political bias and clear dislike for the war in Iraq and the Bush Administration; Couple that with fact that there are 56 documented untruths and I think you would be hard pressed to call this a documentary. However, Mr. Moore does show us a few things.One we live in a great country that protects his right to promote his political agenda. So if you watch Fahrenheit 9/11 please watch the counterpoint, Fahrenhype 9/11 to see both views.Two, war is always horrible in the toll it takes on soldiers and civilians, and should never be entered into lightly. However, after one Gulf War, many resolutions, and a final call to disarm over a 12 year period, one can hardly say the president made a rush decision; whether you agree with the policy or not.Last, the military is a great way to learn a trade, see the world, and pay for college; that is why Mrs. Lipscomb still promotes it. I should add that West Point and The Naval Academy are some of the hardest colleges to get into and are not attended by only those in the lowest socioeconomic bracket. Many people from all walks of life are drawn to the excitement, the challenge, and the desire to serve thier country. Each and every one of those who enlist know full well that it is potentailly dangerous. That is why you get a rifle in boot and not a tutu.Honestly, in these highly charged times you owe it to yourself to listen to both sides and make an informed choice.

Bush was kind of a slacker president. He read My Pet Goat for 7 mintues before telling the class what happened on September 11. The war in Afghanistan ended up not being as big as the war in Iraq which to me is pretty strange because for me the reason the trade center was attacked was because of Osama Bin Laden and his cronies sending their warped believers off on a plane.Footage of the war and certain people's sick attitude about it were very disturbing.

I dislike president Bush and his regime, and think they have been very destructive in their first term (here's hoping the second term isn't so bad). That being said, Moore's controversial &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; is a disappointingly mixed bag. Unlike &quot;Roger and Me&quot; or &quot;Bowling for Columbine,&quot; it's straight propoganda. Moore hits the audience over the head with his message, giving this reviewer a severe headache by the film's close. While Moore doesn't appear on camera as much as his previous films, his narration is near-constant - his narration combined with the endless news footage and documents gives this an irritating &quot;slide show&quot; or &quot;court case&quot; feeling. While Moore's previous films had interesting human stories, &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; gives us only the plight of Flint war mother Lila Lipscomb. Moore attempts some of his trademark pranking, but it's unsatisfactory (particularly in the awkward Patriot Act scene - a prank that peters out before a punchline). After a while, the film just gets dull. That being said, there is still plenty good to say about it - the scene where Lipscomb goes to capitol hill is undeniably moving, and much of the &quot;found footage&quot; (Bush in the classroom reading &quot;My Pet Goat,&quot; the unforgettable &quot;Now watch this drive&quot; scene) is great, and many of the individual scenes (the opening, homeland security) are well done.The DVD has the film in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Since a startling amount of this movie is grainy news footage, there really isn't much the DVD can (or should) do. Suffice to say, the image looks good enough. The real value of the DVD is in the extras. Some of the extras, especially the scene with Condelleza Rice (&quot;I believe it was called 'Bin Laden Determined to Attack Inside the US'&quot;) and the documentary about Arab American comedians. The worst extra is about the release of the film, which is fifteen solid minutes of people saying what a great guy Michael Moore is - dull, dull, dull!

What is funny is the people who say they made up their political minds because of a movie. When you saw the movie Independence Day, did you leave the major cities for fear of an alien attack?  There are some truths in the documentary. There are also some twisted truths and some outright lies. To make up your politcal mind based solely on this is frightening. People will go to vote based on this and this alone for someone to run our country?Moore, by creating this documentary, had only one thing in mind. I do not even believe it was to reshape the minds of many. It was simply to make money. Has Bush made mistakes as the film suggests, absolutely. Would I rather have a Republican in the time of war, most definately. Do I think the Iraq war was a mistake, yes. We should have done it right the first time and finished the job.The one thing I have always been glad to know and see is that most liberals or simply chronic complainers are good for not voting when the time comes.

I thought that Moore, known for his &quot;pouring it on&quot; , sometimes to the point of absurdity, might do our cause more harm than good.This is not the case. In this movie, Moore has restrained himself from exuberant, &quot;over the top&quot; claims and attitudes, and presented us with a work that, although it has its light moments and even some hilarity, will make the audience soberly ponder the path of our current administration.My sole criticism is Moore's voice-over during the footage of Bush, at the Florida elementary school, hearing about the attacks. Moore speculates that Bush may be thinking of his family's business involvements with the Bin Ladens, and other connections to the international oil scene. I think that Moore is giving Bush far too much credit! The man does look stricken, frozen even, but it's probably because he is waiting for someone to tell him what to do.

Bush provides the comedy. In a film that is not merely a machination to poke fun at Bush but also to question and challenge his authority, Moore wants to arouse the audience's senses on a President that has exceeded the exercise of power. Consider this film as a campaign against Bush and its true success can only derive from the inauguration of a man other than him. Well at least in the eyes of Michael Moore.Michael Moore is known for his satiric wit and comedy in films such as ""Roger & Me"" and the Academy Award-winning ""Bowling for Columbine."" In ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" he tones down his screen presence and jokes and instead, said he'll let Bush provide the comedy. In this film, we have a more mature side of Moore because by temptation, it could easily have been a film that ridicules the President's mannerisms and so forth. Instead, the main focus is on the citizens of the United States and even that of Iraq.

Yet, this film is an example of a contrived presentation of the ""truth"" that can anger a Canadian, like myself, who is already against the war before watching the film's introductory credits.This film is a work of propaganda that seeks to convince its audience to agree with a particular point of view by showing a collection of carefully screened and selected snippets of ""reality"".  Michael Moore interviews only those US soldiers that have doubts about the war.  Mr. Moore carefully chooses to interview a mother of a fallen soldier who is emotionally traumatized and angered by the on-duty death of her child, who had VOLUNTEERED (not conscripted) into the US military.  Mr. Moore thoughtfully decides to show footage of Iraqi children killed by US aerial bombardments rather than footage of Kurds massacred by Saddam's soldiers.  Mr. Moore deliberately wants us to watch scenes of US soldiers in Iraq arresting a terrorist/insurgent suspect (who could possibly be released later on) rather than a horrific scene of Saddam's secret police abducting a political dissident (who could well ""disappear"" forever).  Mr. Moore degrades America's coalition of allies by listing only the smaller allies (Morocco, Coasta Rica, etc.) and not mentioning the larger allies (Britain, Australia, etc.).  Thank you Mr. Moore for showing only what you want us to watch and omitting everything else that goes against your misguided anti-Bush crusade.  None of your facts are erroneous, but there are a lot of deliberate omissions designed to give a distorted view of ""reality"".  Further, Mr. Moore prefers to interview women rather than men, or rather, HYSTERICAL (and irrational) women who will provoke an emotional (rather than cool and rational) response from the audience.  Why doesn't Mr. Moore interview a parent of a fallen soldier who can rationally look beyond the death and understand the ""bigger picture""?  Further, it is not natural for any mother to become traumatized by the death of her baby boy even if he had died fighting a more ""just"" war such as the war against Nazi Germany?Finally, could Mr. Moore stop demonizing the Saudis?  The Saudis are like any other people, even if one is disgusted by their method of capital punishment (public beheading) which is actually more swift and humane than death by electricution or lethal injection.Yet, I will give Mr. Moore's film some stars for showing us things that one does not see on CNN, but always watch with a critical eye!  For example, one learns from the film that the Bush family has business ties with rich Saudi families such as the Bin Laden family.  Then again, I personally find nothing nefarious and shocking about this Bush family secret.  Any member of the Bush family should be free to make money by associating with persons from so-called ""evil"" countries as long as this is done while not holding public office.

The only difference is that Riefenstahl didn't call Franklin Roosevelt a liar.Consider the contagion, which Moore willingly spreads, that Bush was reading to schoolchildren when he was told that terrorists had attacked the WTC, and simply kept on reading. Well, according to the liberal _The Washington Post_, while Bush _was_ told about the first plane hitting the WTC while with the kids, everyone thought at that point the first crash was an accident.That's just one of the lies Moore tells in this, uh, ""movie"".  The whole problem with this movie is that Moore isn't ""expressing his beliefs"" -- he's simply lying, pure and simple, and by lying about our Commander-in-Chief during wartime, he's committing treason and sedition -- which, like libel, slander, and inciting riots, are not protected under the First Amendment.Treason is giving aid & comfort to our enemies: for example, Usama bin Laden, or Saddam Hussein.

630040,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JNEI,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[18, 27]","The title of Fahrenheit 9/11 uses the title of Ray Bradbury's science fiction novel where the firefighter's job is to burn books and Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature where paper begins to burns.  The activist and filmmaker Michael Moore happens to get in trouble with Bradbury as he used the title, but Moore used the title in respect of Bradbury.Fahrenheit 9/11 won the Golden Palm in Cannes 2004, which began a long road of controversy as Disney refused to release it, but later it was released by Lions Gate.  The Republican side of America loathes the film while Democrats admire the craftsmanship of Moore as it goes into lengthy detail to reveal President Bush's involvement with the Bin Laden's and the war in Iraq.  The controversy around the film brought more attention to the film as it helped the film break box office records as a documentary.The film focuses on President Bush as Michael Moore is displaying his view of the United States presidency through like minded people.  Moore does this with strong conviction as these people that he displays have become targets to the big presidential machine by ways which include tools such as the Patriot Act, decisions made in regards to the war in Iraq, and family's that have lost loved ones in the Iraq war.  The notion becomes evident as the film unfolds, that it is Moore's desire to oust the current president of United States of America because of his decisions.Whatever political affiliation the audience has all around the world Fahrenheit 9/11 will affect all viewers.  The personal experience of the film will either be positive or negative and this will heavily depend on socioeconomic background, upbringing, and beliefs of the audience.  Whatever the outcome, people should cherish and protect the freedom, without being persecuted in any way, that one has to make a film such as Fahrenheit 9/11, because in a society, e.g., Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, the film would have never been made.",4,Moore Brings Political Controversy to the Box Office...,1098921600,"10 28, 2004",2004,1966,"['title', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'title', 'Ray', 'Bradbury', 'science', 'fiction', 'novel', 'where', 'firefighter', 'job', 'burn', 'books', 'Fahrenheit', '451', 'temperature', 'where', 'paper', 'burns', 'activist', 'filmmaker', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'get', 'trouble', 'Bradbury', 'used', 'title', 'Moore', 'used', 'title', 'respect', 'Bradbury.Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'won', 'Golden', 'Palm', 'Cannes', '2004', 'began', 'long', 'road', 'controversy', 'Disney', 'refused', 'release', 'later', 'was', 'released', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'Republican', 'side', 'America', 'film', 'Democrats', 'admire', 'craftsmanship', 'Moore', 'lengthy', 'detail', 'reveal', 'President', 'Bush', 'involvement', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'war', 'Iraq', 'controversy', 'film', 'brought', 'more', 'attention', 'film', 'helped', 'film', 'break', 'box', 'office', 'records', 'documentary.The', 'film', 'President', 'Bush', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'displaying', 'view', 'United', 'States', 'presidency', 'minded', 'people', 'Moore', 'strong', 'conviction', 'people', 'have', 'become', 'targets', 'big', 'presidential', 'machine', 'ways', 'include', 'tools', 'such', 'Patriot', 'Act', 'decisions', 'made', 'regards', 'war', 'Iraq', 'family', 'have', 'lost', 'loved', 'ones', 'Iraq', 'war', 'notion', 'evident', 'film', 'unfolds', 'Moore', 'desire', 'oust', 'current', 'president', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'decisions.Whatever', 'political', 'affiliation', 'audience', 'world', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'will', 'affect', 'viewers', 'personal', 'experience', 'film', 'will', 'either', 'be', 'positive', 'negative', 'will', 'heavily', 'depend', 'socioeconomic', 'background', 'upbringing', 'beliefs', 'audience', 'outcome', 'people', 'should', 'cherish', 'protect', 'freedom', 'being', 'persecuted', 'way', 'one', 'make', 'film', 'such', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'society', 'e.g.', 'Ray', 'Bradbury', 'Fahrenheit', '451', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'made']",Fahrenheit 9/11

Bernabo,"[34, 56]","In former days, that is to say ""once upon a time,"" the greatest coup in politics was to run an attack ad once and get all of the network news shows to run it over and over again for free.  This has been true from the infamous ""Daisy"" commercial that was run for Lyndon B. Johnson against Barry Goldwater in 1964 to the even more infamous ""Willie Horton"" ad that was used to attack Michael Dukakis on behalf of George Bush in 1988.  But that standard has changed now with Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11.""  As of the last box office report, this documentary has made $119,078,393 in the United States, which does not include the take from other nations or the number of DVDs and videotapes that have been bought.  In other words, Moore has not only created a 2-hour political attack ad against President George W. Bush, he is getting millions of people to PAY him to see it.  Then again, President Bush has an entire new network behind his candidacy with FOX News, so you can also argue that Moore is behind the times rather than ahead.I fully understand that this being a Michael Moore documentary indicting George W. Bush for the War in Iraq is enough for most people to make up their minds about it, but I still think everybody, regardless of ideological persuasion, should see it before they bury or praise ""Fahrenheit 9/11.""  I also do not want to get into the maelstrom around the documentary and restrict this review to just what I saw when I watched it this morning.  Yes, it is a political diatribe and like any political statement during an election cycle (the battle lasts longer than a year) it is filled with distortions, omissions, lies, and every other sin associated with political rhetoric.  But we know that the judgment for such things is not whether they are ""true"" but whether they are ""real"" enough to make a difference.Ultimately I found ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" was a bit too disjointed in constructing the coherent argument it appears to be actually making in the end.  Just like is the case with most of the papers I get from my students, the true thesis comes near the end when Moore contends that we should never send our troops into harm's way without knowing they are fighting for the right reasons.  That particular point is implicit at best for a lot of the film and you have to retroactively go back and connect the dots.  The reasons why the war is wrong in the first part of the film are not the same reasons that are offered at the end.  I am sure Moore abstains from providing a linear argument as part of the creative impulse, but I think there was one to be advanced here that would better serve his purpose.Some of the most affecting parts of the documentary speak to things that transcend this specific war.  Pictures of dead and wounded children are always going to be upsetting (add the long distance shot of a beheading and the charred corpses of Americans being dragged through the streets in Iraq and the R rating is easily justified).  American soldiers are always going to be too young to go off to war and kill or be killed.  Politicians are never going to want it to be their children who go off to die in the wars they vote to authorize.  I thought Moore trying to get Congressmen to sign up their kids to go fight the war was the lamest part of the film, partially because you know it is not going to happen and also because the technique has been done to death on ""60 Minutes"" and all of its kindred news magazines.  Nor does the idea that young American troops get psyched up by playing obnoxious heavy metal songs offend me because I have long understood that soldiers will do what they have to do to get through a battle.In terms of what is happening in Iraq since the ""Mission Accomplished"" banner was put up on that aircraft carrier to be seen behind Bush when he declared victory, Moore decided slants everything towards what American troops are doing to outrage the ordinary Iraqi citizens who are supposed to be overjoyed by being freed.  However, I think Moore missed a potent line of argument by becoming fixated on the ""Mission Accomplished"" banner instead of Bush's invitation to the insurgents to ""Bring it on,"" which I think is clearly the most regrettable thing the President has said while in office.  All of this just underscores that the ""war,"" however you want to conceive it, is obviously much more complex than can dealt with even in a three-hour tour (a three-hour tour including all of the extras on the DVD, the best of which are the comments and jokes of the Arab-American comedians).His techniques are no different from what we are seeing in the relentless onslaught of paid political advertising.  The parody of the title credits for ""Bonanza"" redone for ""Afghanistan"" is good for a laugh and any politician or ordinary human being having make up put on them before appearing on camera is going to look like an idiot.  I was thinking that combining slow motion shots with ominous music and an equally ominous voice over would do to Jesus of Nazareth (""""Render unto God the things that are God's'?....another religious fanatic from the Middle East..."").  The most persuasive person in the film for me and I suspect for many is Lila Lipscomb, the mother of a Flint, Michigan boy who dies in Iraq when a Blackhawk helicopter is downed.  A lifelong supporter of the American military, she changes her mind about Iraq, haunted by not only her son's death but also his last letter in which he lashed out at Bush and the war.  In the end it is impossible to tar her with the same brush that can be used to castigate Moore for his political polemic.In terms of being provocative there is no doubt Moore has clearly achieved his goal.  The question is whether he is actually persuading a significant number of people to adopt his view or whether he is simply preaching (and selling) to the choir.  Ironically, we will probably no more know the answer to that question than he ever will the real reasons for the decision to invade Iraq.",4,Michael Moore's two-hour political message plays for

630051,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00005JNEI,Linda Linguvic,"[142, 195]","I was prepared to be critical of this sell-out film. I?ve seen Michael Moore's other films and I know he distorts things to his own agenda. He seems to be a bit of a bully. And I don?t like the fact that he?s going around the world bad-mouthing America.Yet, I'm concerned about the future of my beloved country. I sense deeply that George Bush and his administration have messed things up. There has to be a change in leadership. And this intrusive filmmaker looks like a catalyst to make that happen.Mr. Moore knows his craft well. He knows how to select just the perfect film clips that will make his subject look ridiculous. His background music makes us laugh. And his voice-over commentary is cutting and sarcastic. There are also images of horror, such as the victims of war with devastating wounds. He?s kind to the American soldiers though. They?re victims too and we meet the double amputees who are languishing in hospitals and not getting their proper benefits.The central theme of the film, however, is the tremendous wealth that the Bush family and other corporate executives are acquiring because of their ties to the Saudis. He makes our country look like a war machine with nothing but profits on its mind. Mr. Moore has first-hand experience the result of corporate greed in his hometown of Flint Michigan as he illustrated many years ago in his film ?Roger and Me?. And, indeed, he returns to Flint again in this film. Here, like other depressed area of the country, the military is a way out of poverty. We meet a woman whose son is in Iraq. She?s a proud American and even flies an American flag outside her family?s modest house every single day. Some time during the filming, her son is killed. The war now become up close and personal as we all share her grief.I did expect this film would manipulate my emotions. I wanted to resist and watch the film from a point of rationality. That was impossible though. I got caught up in the frenzy of Mr. Moore?s mission, which is to bring down the Bush administration. And at the end of the film I was applauding loudly with the rest of the audience.I know that this film had a hard time getting released and this just adds to the hype and publicity about it. And, in a way it is truly an American story. Because only in America would anyone dare to do this kind of hatchet job on the President. In other countries, Mr. Moore would have had his tongue cut out, or worse.This is an important film. See it. Think about it. Talk about it. And understand.Highly recommended.

630052,A1JJ8R0NTMF8DE,B00005JNEI,Little Old Me,"[24, 29]","Fahrenheit 9/11 was my introduction to the works of Michael Moore - and what an introduction at that!  I was a little hesitant to attend the movie at first, thinking Moore's documentary would be simply preaching to the choir.  After all, I find most of us are completely divided down the middle - we are either supporting the war and its ideals OR are completely against it.  I've met very people who are truly lost in between.  But after 2 hours, I was convinced that Fahrenheit 9/11 is an essential American movie right now and plainly delivers some hard facts that the White House has censored since Bush's inauguration.Michael Moore makes the ideal narrator, able to describe countless layers of information in plain English.  Personally, I've found myself dumbfounded with countless articles and news reports that are constantly delivering conflicting information.  Moore plainly goes through each layer of deceit, without fully stepping into conspiracy theories.  Though many extremists would like us to believe that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were completely staged by the government, Moore doesn't fall into that category.  He shows us how plainly September 11th was the product of Bush's negligence.Moore's documentary succeeds in putting raw facts out in the public eye and showing how each of them (while alone seem insignificant) result in a chain reaction.  Someone who has never followed politics can see step-by-step how an election could have been ""fixed"" and how statements by the White House officials have changed in a moments notice.  As Moore points out, one minute we're told to be on high-terrorist alert and to take all necessary precautions and the very next message is for us to go about our normal lives and still patronize restaurants and shopping centers without any fear.  *Sigh*  One thing, I found most disturbing was seeing how connected the Bush family is with the Bin Laden family.  Again, Moore doesn't try and point out a conspiracy theory here, but when the Bush Jr., Bush Sr. and many of their colleagues are making millions of dollars in profits because of this business relationship, it kind of makes you wonder why the all the Saudi Arabians were allowed to leave the country without be questioned.  An interview with one of the people involved int he Sept. 11th investigations even said, we were not there to point the fingers or make arrests, but its common practice to interrogate family members and friends of a suspect (i.e. Osama Bin Laden).One of the hardest moments are sneak peaks into the war.  Actual testimonies from American soliders and their parents, including snippets of personal letters from Iraq that are usually censored before they even reach the families at home.  But don't be mistaken, the movie doesn't argue against all war, but directly shows how this one was mishandled and was used to protect the Bush Family's personal investments over the lives of every-day Americans.I'll be honest, I don't agree with every detail in Fahrenheit 9/11, but as a whole, there's a lot of truth that has escaped the public's attention.  The true message of the movie is: we have been fooled, lied to, used and abused by a very strong network of political figures and greedy corporate heads.

I was afraid it would bring back the trauma I felt in 2001.  I had visited the World Trade Center as a child and a teen.  New York City was one of my favorite places to visit.  I went there about twelve times before I turned 18.  I finally decided that I would never really be ready, so I decided to watch it.Moore devotes very little screen time to the day of 9-11, having only a minute of audio and another few minutes of stunned N.Y.C. passersby and a shot of the missing persons' wall.  In a way I was both disappointed and relieved.  I did want to see that day from Moore's perpective, but then again, why relive the images we all saw that day and for days after?  I was not traumatized, but I was deeply disturbed - for political reasons.Michael Moore's Farenheit 9-11 is unquestionably anti-Bush and biased.  But Moore's evidence of conspiracy-like connections between the Texas Bush family and the Al Saud royal family of Saudi Arabia is brilliant.  The volume and scope of Moore's research is staggering.Saudi Arabia is one of the most controlled and restrictive countries in the world.  The government follows a fundamentalist Wahhabi Islam that no other country adheres to.  The U.S. State Department says in their Human Rights report that Saudi Arabia is guilty of torture, violence towards women and children, and throwing people into prison for circulating petitions.So disturbing is the fact Bush allowed all of the Bin Ladens in the U.S. to flee the country two days after the disaster, without letting law enforcement question the family members.The Saudi-Bush connection is not the only target of Moore.  He targets the military for actively recruiting young, poor minorities in Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan.  Moore also interviews some troops who have deep reservations about the war and about their commander-in-chief.In the beginning of the documentary, the botched Florida election results and the plea of African-Americans to the U.S. Senate brings shame on George W. Bush and the Senate.  Moore portrays Bush as a yokel, but a sly one, with vast power and connections that seem to make him unstoppable.I am incredulous that even after Farenheit 9-11 was such a big smash at the box office, that Bush was re-elected.  After we viewed the film, my husband said, ""Bush has no conscience.""  Isn't that a scary thing to say about your president?

The topic of this film isn't fiction. We are a nation at war. September 11th was not a dream. As American citizens we must review ALL sides before drawing any conclusions. With Moore's film, we as the American public get to see a side of these travesties not covered by the media. (...) There was too much footage of September 11th and the present War in Iraq of the dying soldiers, wounded soldiers, Iraqi women and children, and families from both Iraq and America. If you laughed, that's disgusting because no matter how you feel about Bush, you have to give those people some respect. A good friend of mine is presently serving in Iraq. She's 27 and has 2 children. She also 3 siblings also in the military and 2 of which are also in Iraq. This is a REAL war for some of us and I encourage everyone to please keep an open mind when watching this film. I did subtract a star in my rating simply because I did feel that Michael Moore did unnecessarily bash Bush in a couple of moments by taking what he said out of context. I'm not even a Bush supporter and I will admit to that. I also think to some more easily influenced, it will give a false impression that Bush is somehow in favor of this war for profit or just trying to cover his own butt. I don't buy that at all. I really think HE believes he's doing the right thing for the better cause of the USA and for the rest of the world, but just because he thinks he's right, doesn't make him right.I think many people oppose this film because they are afraid of not necessarily the ""truth"" but because it WILL make you think. We're used to being told what we should think and when you watch this film, even if you still support Bush in the end, I know that for at least a moment, you WILL question what's going on in this country. It obviously impacted enough people to come on here and write a review. It obviously impacted enough corporate  giants and politicians to try and steer the public from seeing this film.

The beauty of this film is that it outlines a damning scenario with a singularity of vision that is so clear, no one can miss it or even misunderstand it.

it just hits you in a different way.  the fact that someone out there finally had the gumption to let out a loud, unforgiving, blustery scream for accountability in the halls of power is what's most admirable here.contrary to popular belief, the bold faced lies that the self-righteous right likes to rant and rave about are few and far between in this movie.  there is emotionally manipulative footage, yes.  but emotional manipulation is what it takes to get people to change their minds, even if it's for their own good.  it would be easy to make a clean, objective documentary about the dismal failure that is the bush administration; heck, the facts sure are there.  sadly, the vast majority of americans can't be bothered with that or drawing their own conclusions and as such, the bush campaign was very effective this fall as it relied on many of the same tactics as michael moore's movie.  john kerry and the democratic campaign played it safe and avoided character assasination, exaggeration, under-the-table sponsorship of ""non-partisan"" activist groups and all the other bullsh*t the RNC has down to a fine art and they lost, obviously.  if it's never been crystal-clear before, it is in this day and age: now is not the time for subtlety.  despite all this, the case made against bush amidst all of the unnecessary footage is about as solid as you can get.  check out michael moore's website for a blow-by-blow factual backup of every last claim in this movie including sources.  even i was surprised at the amount of fact-checking that went into it.  zell miller's speech at the republican national convention had more truth stretching in it than this movie by a long shot.make no mistake about it, fahrenheit 9/11 hits you at a gut, visceral level. it does not shy away from the full-on carnage and gore of the iraq war when most news cameras would cut away.  this movie is simply fighting fire with fire; there are no opposing viewpoints in it at all because the same tactics are being utilized by the republican party to try to convert people although there are many, many more lies necessary to make their case.  it only makes sense that the right wing would hate this movie with all of its fury seeing as to how it was released during a pivotal election year.  calling it an attempt to slander the president is a cop-out; a weak answer to such a stunning piece of art as well as telling commentary on the direction of the political winds of our time.  there is no slander in this movie.  everything that appears in fahrenheit 9/11 is real and sums up the post-9/11 world that we live in today. there's no need for him to make a damn thing up; it's happening right in front of our eyes.no matter how you slice it, michael moore is only doing what any concerned american would do.  blind acceptance and trust in any administration has and always will mark the downfall of a free people.  if you love michael moore, if you hate michael moore, or if you just don't know yet, you owe it to yourself to see this movie.  it received standing ovations in my home (and very red) state of north carolina, and that says a lot.  the endless, brain-dead blather about michael moore being unpatriotic or un-american has to stop.  this is america;

The successful use of other music, including Jarvo's 'Cantus in Memory of Benjamin Britten' and most of the pop elements, is indebted to the deeply felt original score Gibbs has created. Synth effects, maybe, but the pieces are beautifully conceived, if not entirely without precedent. The brutal effect of the film depends so tenderly on the musical score, one is reminded of Britten's high valuation of the usefulness of music. Moore's vision is commendable, and beholden in turn to the musical tableaux of Jeff Gibbs. The soundtrack CD is fine, but needs the film as much as the film cries out for Gibbs' music.  Highest recommendation for both film and musical score, both Moore and his composer. [2007 update: It's unfortunate, isnt it, how the conservative/fascist think tanks that blight the American social-political landscape actually hire people to scour [...], among other sites, in order to vote 'negative' on reviews that repudiate their vicious political agenda? This is a well documented fact. The 'votes' against this review are one example - negative 'votes' for what is really a non-political review of a film, a review focused almost entirely on the film's musical score!

Why are they constantly on the news stations with the time and the newscrawl?  What purpose do they serve?  Does it make sense to ban toenail clippers on airplanes but allow butane lighters and matches?  Someone in a state of fear will agree to almost anything; someone in a state of fear told to do two contradictory things will just give up.  Cheney tells us to be on the alert, Bush tells us to go shopping. So the American public is terrorized, but it isn't by who you think.  And that's one of the many things Michael Moore reminds us in Fahrenheit 9/11.There is little here that hasn't been said, yet this may be the most important film of the year.  What Moore has done is skillfully weave a funny, tragic, and shocking tale out of a complicated series of claims and counterclaims.  Beginning with the 2000 election and the complete rollover of the Democrats during what was a silent coup, Moore reminds the viewer of everything that happened if only we had paid attention and gotten angry instead of fearful.There are two kinds of people who watch films like these: those who go in already agreeing with Moore, and those who haven't made their minds up.  (The third type, the ones who already ""know ""this film is full of bias, lies, and distortions, won't bother watching it at all.)  There's plenty of red meat for the liberals: Bush looking clueless when told of the second plane crash on 9/11 (and the 7 minutes he sat in an elementary school classroom, waiting to be told what to do); the Bush family's ties to the Saudi royal family and the surprising revelation that the Secret Service guards the Saudi embassy (but no others); the Fresno peace group full of cookie-baking fiftysomethings that was infiltrated by an undercover sheriff's deputy; the mom on the plane forced to drink her own breastmilk because it might be a weapon.But it's what's there for the fence sitters that's more important.  It's not just the War for Oil story; it's the contrast between Bush and his tuxedo-clad elites (who Bush jocularly refers to as his ""base"") and Moore's devastated hometown of Flint, Michigan.  (Longtime Moore fans will remember all Flint's woes from his seminar film Roger & Me, which chronicled the city's collapse when GM closed a huge auto plant.)  There in Flint, Moore follows two Army recruiters who attempt to sign up its unemployed youth, who clearly have nowhere else to go.  And from there, Moore lets Lila Lipscomb, a former welfare recipient who pulled herself up via job training, tell her story.  She encouraged her children to join the military because she had no money for college.  Her daughter served proudly in Desert Storm.  Her son went to Iraq, and his last letter home questioned why the troops were there.  The most powerful moment in a film chock full of them was Lila facing down an angry woman who accuses Moore of ""staging"" an Iraqi woman's makeshift shrine to her family members killed there.  Lila turns on her, revealing that her son was killed in Karbala on April 2nd, and then storms over to stare at the White House.  Armed snipers patrol the roof, and we are reminded of the mindless terror alerts that were not there to fight terrorists but to make us fearful.If you are not 100% convinced that Bush is absolutely right in all things, this is a film you must take the time to see.  You will be angry, you will laugh, and you will cry.  But all of these are far more cathartic than being afraid.  15 July 2004 Maddi Hausmann Sojourner",5,"Don't be afraid.  Be angry.

630063,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B00005JNEI,magellan,"[5, 18]","First I should say I'm neither a liberal nor a conversative and can't call myself any particular political stripe, since, depending on the issue, I range from liberal to conservative, and more likely indifferent these days. I think America has fallen from the great country it once was politically and socially, mainly due to 40 years of mediocre presidents and inept and venal politicians who care very little for the welfare of the American people and only about lining their own pockets. I don't see much reason to care at all anymore or to vote, which is too bad, since at one time I was quite patriotic and really loved this country. Sure, we have freedom and free speech, which is great, but sadly that hasn't prevented the country from still going to the dogs over the last several decades.I heard so much about this film, so I had to finally rent it. It's a decent film but I didn't find it as engrossing or interesting as it had been made out to be, but I will give him four stars for effort since, if all the allegations about the Bush family's ties to the Saudis and Bin Laden family are true, this needs to be said. But there's no doubt about Moore's central premise, that the U.S. is mostly in Iraq for oil and money. As Major General Smedley Butler said two generations ago, when the dollar gets tired of making 6% at home, it starts looking for ways to make 100% abroad, and the flag follows the money, and the soldiers follow the flag.Whether one is liberal or conservative or independent or whatever, it's time for the American people to take back their control of the political process from the special interests and politicians who have no other interest but their own.Actually, at this point, I would be happy to embrace with open arms a president of almost ANY political stripe as long as he had some geopolitical and economic smarts and at least had a coherent plan. I'm tired of the clueless office spaceholders we've had for almost 40 years. We used to have giants for presidents in the past, at least once in a while--Lincoln, a Teddy Rooseveldt, FDR, even Truman was pretty cool. Now we get pygmies 100% of the time. Only it's more like totally clueless and inept pygmies. At least a good pygmy knows how to shoot a blowgun.By the way, on the oil and money issue, most people don't know that many years ago, when Saddam was bombing the Kurds, Rumsfeld met with Saddam, long before he was Secretary, not to complain about his killing Kurds, but to negotiate an oil deal. The meeting was secret at the time but it eventually got out that he'd met with Saddam during this time. Guess what, Rumsfeld didn't say anything about the Kurds issue but we were concerned about getting a juicy oil contract.Oh well, that's all I have to say on this depressing issue of present America's moral, social, and economic decline (the current war expenses and deficit and high gas prices will likely cause inflation and serious economic consequences eventually. There's a reason why economics is called ""The dismal science""). I hope America eventually finds its moral compass and goes back to being the sort of great country it once was, but I doubt that will ever happen. Great countries don't just happen, they are built by great people working with great leaders.

630068,A1JDT2VPCZVQW9,B00005JNEI,"Marie Anne A. ""Mary""","[4, 11]","but it's still a nicely done propaganda piece for leftist Moore. I saw this movie twice, maybe two weeks apart, in September 2004. I loved it, mostly because I was very liberal at the time.Moore claims that the Bush family's many connections enabled W to steal the election from Gore. The Bush family had dealings with prominent Saudi families, not limited to the weapons sales during the 80's. Bin Laden is Saudi, but resided with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Bush invaded Afghanistan after they attacked us, but since he couldn't or wouldn't capture Bin Laden, he decided to inflict more fear on the American people. So, it's off to make war on Iraq, and when soldiers become disillusioned and don't re-enlist, Bush pulls new recruits from the poor and minority communities. Naturally, Moore uses this to advertise his adopted hometown of Flint, Michigan.It's been six years, and I rented this documentary from my library. I'd just seen and reviewed 2004's Michael Moore Hates America, and thought it'd be good to revisit Fahrenheit 9/11. I'm conservative now, but I still give Moore credit for creating this piece. He knows how to put together a propaganda piece. He interviews the right people, gets the right footage, the right music and edits them to prove his point. He's a droll narrator, too.BUT, it's been six years. I think most people who would want this DVD already own it. If you like collecting propaganda pieces from the all sides of the American politcal spectrum, add this one to your collection.

630069,A36EW68H08UOCS,B00005JNEI,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[20, 33]","Although I'm a life-long Conservative Republican, I'm also an American, and I recognize that ""The American Way"" has not only allowed but actually SUPPORTED the right to say what's on your mind.  It was Voltaire who said ""I may not agree with what you say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it."" And that philosophy heavily influenced Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and other founding fathers.  More than any other nation in history, America is a country where the rights and beliefs of the citizens - even those who disagree- are protected.If you believe that Michael Moore is a big fat liberal nutcase, you have every right in America to believe that. If you offer any opinion on ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" when you haven't even SEEN it - you're showing off your ignorance, and in America I get to believe that too.Certainly Michael Moore made the movie to bash George W. Bush and to prevent his re-election.  But not only is his right to do that protected in America, (And I thank God every day to live in a country with rights like ours) but Mr. Moore brings up some very legitimate concerns.When the first plane hit the first Trade Center Tower on September 11th I heard about it on the radio immediately and I remember thinking ""isn't that odd? Maybe somebody was impaired - pilot had a heart attack or something...."" But this report was followed minutes later by the crash into the 2nd Tower and I immediately knew ""this means a terrorist attack of LARGE proportions"".  The President received this word while he was sitting in front of an elementary school class, and I've heard that his explanation for his actions were that he ""didn't want to alarm the children"".  I'm ALL for not alarming children any more than they need to be - but when you're the President and your country is being attacked on a scale that you don't know of yet - I think it's okay to say ""sorry kids, I need to go be President - I know you'll understand""..... or something like that.  Instead, Mr. Bush just sat there - for seven minutes.  Not the ideal response from my Commander-In-Chief.Mr. Moore also makes a pretty convincing argument that ties between Middle Eastern Oil, the Bin Laden family and the White House don't look very good.  Perhaps things are utterly innocent between the Bushes and the Saudi's.... but members of the military are taught to not only do no wrong, but also to not do anything that has even the APPEARANCE of wrongness.  This movie has it's own agenda, but I give Mr. Moore credit for skillfully highlighting the appearance of impropriety.His editing and writing are skillful, and he has a real knack for catching folks at inopportune moments.  I like the moment when he is standing across the street from the Saudi embassy - far away from the White House - when the White House Secret Service suddenly pulls up and asking what they're doing there.  Mr. Moore seems to politely say ""we're just here shooting a documentary, and part of it is about Saudi Arabia.... I didn't know that the secret service guards foreign embassies."" ""Not usually"", the secret service guy replies.  ""Do they give you much trouble - the Saudis?"" Michael Moore asks.  ""No comment"" - the officer says.  ""I'll take that as a 'Yes'"", Moore concludes. It couldn't have gone better for Michael Moore if he had staged it himself.For those who say ""don't watch this!!!!"" I say: Why not?  It's not obscene. It doesn't threaten national security or my religion.Coming away from this film my thought was ""I'm not certain Mr. Bush is doing the best job that he could as President.""  And I don't feel disrespectful or unpatriotic to want my President to do the best job he (or she!) could.  I remain hopeful - hopeful enough that I still voted for Mr. Bush in the recently completed election.You can disagree with Michael Moore.  But please don't try to say that he doesn't have a right to say what he likes.

""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is one of the most powerful films I've ever seen. It's also profound, passionate, persuasive and penetrating. But more than all that, it's courageous! Like him, or hate him, no one can deny this was an incredible act of courage.He takes on George W. and his administration so convincingly, so thoroughly, Howard Dean must be standing on a street corner somewhere in Vermont screaming ""Amen!""Interestingly enough, the movie wasn't nearly as slanted as I assumed it would be. And he didn't limit his wrath or criticism to Bush alone, or even the Republicans alone. Fingers were pointed and jabbed at both sides of the isle as well as almost all facets of the media. He painted a picture, albeit not a pretty one, step by step, stroke by stroke, meticulously and hypnotically. And by the end it was to this viewer an unqualified masterpiece.He goes to great length to make it abundantly clear that all Americans should and do support our troops, even if we don't support this war. He effectively illustrates the horror of which they've been thrust into, and the futility of what they're up against. Only one child of the entire Congress of the United States of America is actually over there in Irag fighting. The look on the congressmen's faces of which he was interviewing when he asked if they would be willing to enlist their children in this war to show their support was priceless and telling.He goes on to fill this canvas with such shocking persuasive anecdotes, interviews and news clips that most of the audience is left in horror, disgust or laughter.There's no question that Moore is biased, but he's so thorough, so passionate, so sincere that by the end of the movie one can't help but wonder if there's not a whole lot more truth to what he's conveying than anyone was ever willing to admit out loud.Every American, of every political, cultural and racial persuasion should see this movie for themselves. And from there, let their consciences be their guide. If the standing ovation and applause at the end of the near sold-out show my wife and I attended this morning in Del Mar was any indication, we're in for turbulent summer.Kudos to Lions Gate for being so instrumental in bringing this vitally important work to the screen.

Probably a combo of being tired of politics and thinking it could not tell me much more then I already knew at the time.For the most part it's a good film.  Moore does a great job in that it's a great vehicle for questions, discussion and debate.I am only knocking it a point for some of the ""antics"" Moore did for the film.  I didn't care of the bit with the ice cream truck where he drove around reading the patriot act since congress didn't read it.  The everpresent ""ambush"" of congressmen is a rather tired bit and overused.  I think it took away from a well crafted film.  I liked the cabinet people going through makeup, the bit where Ashcroft was singing and theBushisms.  One thing that was really well done was the seven minutes where Bush sat there doing nothing or reading to the children.  I remember it when it happened and it showed the difference between a leader and this man.  A leader acts.Other parts of the film where sad and gave me an impression of exploitation.  Such as the woman talking of the loss of her son and later appears at a protest upset and can only mention loosing her son.  Even though there are hints of exploitation, Moore didn't go full into exploiting the collapse of the twin towers.  There is only a couple after shots and a blacked out image with sound tracks.  Very effective I found as even though I had seen it; I still listened.One thing I found interesting was his section involving homeland security and the Oregon coast.  One man for a large territory.  There was even an extra about old volunteers trying to patrol South Florida.  Very pertinent info when thinking of the current reports of the lack of security on our borders.Probably one of the most provocative things was his explanations of molding the people by instilling fear.  The use of the terror alerts and reports of eminent attacks.  I think it did mold people for the war.The addons are interesting.

630076,A25ACLV5KPB4W,B00005JNEI,"Matt Hetling ""Matt""","[8, 20]","It seems that a film documentarian has two main jobs. First, to shoot or find some compelling footage that keeps our interest; second, to assemble that footage in a way that tells a larger story or makes a significant point.Moore has accomplished these two goals in spades, using footage from a wide variety of sources to build a damning case against President George Bush as pertains to the so-called war on terror.My main criticism of the film comes from a conflicted frame of mind. On one hand, Moore has exaggerated facts and manipulated situations to such an extent that his film can't be truthfully labeled anything other than propaganda. On the other hand, the propaganda is in line with the daily rants of popular right wing radio hosts such as Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. When a liberal like Moore uses extremist methods to build an argument, it balances out their right wing extremism. But it also rings a little false now and again. I guess it's just not possible to have it both ways, but the coloring of the facts did leave me cold at times.Highlights of the film include footage of a woman who lost her son in the Iraq war, which left my girlfriend and I wet-eyed. Testimony from US soldiers in Iraq also paints a picture of a majority who have desensitized themselves to the deaths they are causing through the use of bravado, and others who are miserable at the carnage they see around them.In another segment, Moore shows the footage of Bush when he is told that the nation is under attack. Rather than respond with authority, Bush sits there for several minutes, reading a storybook to children as part of a promotional visit he had planned. Moore notes that no one told Bush what to do, and that his response was therefore to just sit there. Close ups of his face, slowed down to emphasize a nervous rocking, lead us to wonder what thoughts Bush was thinking, and to conclude that they were probably not the thoughts that we want our leadership to have.Also of great interest to me were interviews with Iraqis, which humanized them, and footage of the aggressive recruitment tactics that Marine recruiters use in poor neighborhoods.Some of the other segments worked less well for me, and the string of connections between the Bush administration, Saudi Arabia, and big oil was almost boring for me, since I had already read that the ties existed.There is one great scene, however, in which Bush is seen joking at a dinner that he is addressing ""the Haves, and the Have-Mores...some people call you the elite; I call you my base.""

Hopefully we can all agree on at least this much: because America allows freedom of speech Michael Moore was able to make this film and find help getting it to the public.As we know, in Fahrenheit 9/11 Moore decries what he considers to be Bush's lack of initiative to prevent terrorism before the fateful September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on our nation. He then proceeds to demonstrate that the Bush family had long standing business ties with the Saudis. He cites sources (including, of course, Richard Clarke) to demonstrate that the Bush administration intended to attack Iraq from almost the first day they took the White House. All in all, this film is Moore's scathing attack on the Bush administration and the Republican party for what he sees as their lack of true concern for the welfare of the American people, putting their personal business interests above everything else. Moore also attacks Cheney for his connections to the Saudis through Halliburton as well.I admire Moore for his bravery in taking on the powerful Bush family. Freedom of speech allows this and Moore had the right to make this film just as anyone has the right to speak their mind in our nation.There are times in this film when Bush does look inept, as when he takes seven minutes to have any response to the news from his chief of staff that the second of the two twin towers in NYC had been hit by a plane. Moore takes great pains to interview soldiers in Iraq and he succeeded to getting them to truly open up about their feelings both pro and con against the war. It was especially refreshing to hear the candid mixed feelings soldiers had about the Iraq war since our news media typically does not cover that angle of this story. I personally felt broken hearted for Lila Lipscomb, the mother of a son killed in Iraq. Moore succeeds in bringing an emotional element to this film both through the soldier interviews and the interviews with Lipscomb. It makes one wonder about the necessity of this war, especially in light of the fact that no weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq. (Indeed, on this afternoon's CNN.com web site there is a major story as I write this that ""top U.S. arms inspector reported Wednesday that he found no evidence that Iraq produced any weapons of mass destruction after 1991."") One thing was absent, however: never once was it mentioned that Clinton also ignored terrorist warnings for a long time--it wasn't just Bush!The DVD comes with a slew of extras that are also very captivating and interesting to watch. One extra was filmed outside the now infamous Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq the day they released 100 prisoners. I was disturbed at the prison abuse they received. Perhaps American soldiers over there have to be extremely careful and protect themselves by rounding up potential resistance people; but prisoner abuse is not the American way and it brings us down. We also see Condoleezza Rice's 9/11 Commission testimony as well as Bush saying not much after a ""conversation"" with the 9/11 Commission. There is a troubling look at the inadequate security patrol of the coast of Florida as well as the lack of protection in Oregon state.I recommend that people see this film if they can. The DVD and extras are thought provoking. If you agree with Michael Moore, then it will make you feel great that he got his message across. If you disagree with Moore, see the film anyway--a thorough understanding of his stance will help you think and sharpen your opinions and beliefs to the contrary. Moore has indeed made a significant contribution to the very hot issues of the Iraq war and politics as it relates to big money and big business.

630079,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JNEI,Matthew Horner,"[20, 29]","Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore is a master showman. His documentaries have always done well at the boxoffice, but ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" proved to be a runaway hit. It will probably be a long, long time before any movie of this type again takes in so much money.Its success is also a tribute to his abilities as a filmmaker. Many argue that he doesn't play fair, that he's a left-wing nutcase. Others see him as a great essayist who readily admits his works are biased by nature. To me, the fact that he can stir great debate proves that he is ingenious.What makes ""Fahrenheit 9//11"" so controversial is that it takes direct aim at George W. Bush and his administration. It is perhaps the most savagely satirical documentary about a sitting President ever made.The opening of the movie makes fun of Bush, who, having learned of the 9/11/2001 terrorists attacks while he visiting a Florida school, sits for a full nine minutes reading a book about a goat to a group of kids. This is an example of the `unfair' Moore. Why should the President be any less stunned by the event than the rest of us? When unreal events occur, it takes awhile for us to adjust to the `new' reality.Where the movie really takes hold is later, when Bush and company decides to invade Iraq. People all over the world, including America, asked themselves what this had to do with the war on terror. Moore's point that the invasion was based on an agenda other than fighting terrorism is fascinating. [He zeroes in on the cozy relationship between the Bush family and the rulers of Saudi Arabia, home to 15 of the 9/11 hijackers.] His focus on the REAL sacrifice of our troops is fascinating. His juxtaposition of our government's assertion that the war is surgical, precise and humane versus the real suffering on the ground in Iraq is brilliant.In an era in which all media outlets are controlled by giant corporations, Moore's voice, irritating as it can sometimes be, is refreshing. [Case in point: The movie was to be released originally by feisty Disney subsidiary, Miramax Films. The head of Disney decided that the film was too controversial, reportedly because, at the time, Disney was vying for some tax incentives in the state of Florida, whose governor is Jeb Bush, brother of George W.]",4,An exceptionally fine example of the documentary genre,1097366400,"10 10, 2004",2004,2271,"['Documentary', 'filmmaker', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'master', 'showman', 'documentaries', 'have', 'always', 'done', 'well', 'boxoffice', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'proved', 'be', 'runaway', 'hit', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'movie', 'type', 'again', 'so', 'much', 'money.Its', 'success', 'also', 'tribute', 'abilities', 'filmmaker', 'Many', 'argue', ""n't"", 'play', 'fair', 'left-wing', 'nutcase', 'Others', 'see', 'great', 'essayist', 'who', 'readily', 'works', 'are', 'biased', 'nature', 'fact', 'can', 'stir', 'great', 'debate', 'proves', 'ingenious.What', 'Fahrenheit', '9//11', 'so', 'controversial', 'direct', 'aim', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'administration', 'perhaps', 'most', 'savagely', 'satirical', 'documentary', 'sitting', 'President', 'ever', 'made.The', 'opening', 'movie', 'fun', 'Bush', 'who', 'having', 'learned', '9/11/2001', 'terrorists', 'attacks', 'visiting', 'Florida', 'school', 'sits', 'full', 'nine', 'minutes', 'reading', 'book', 'goat', 'group', 'kids', 'example', 'unfair', 'Moore', 'Why', 'should', 'President', 'be', 'less', 'stunned', 'event', 'rest', 'When', 'unreal', 'events', 'occur', 'awhile', 'adjust', 'new', 'reality.Where', 'movie', 'really', 'hold', 'later', 'when', 'Bush', 'company', 'invade', 'Iraq', 'People', 'world', 'including', 'America', 'asked', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'war', 'terror', 'Moore', 'point', 'invasion', 'was', 'based', 'agenda', 'other', 'fighting', 'terrorism', 'fascinating', 'cozy', 'relationship', 'Bush', 'family', 'rulers', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'home', '15', '9/11', 'hijackers', ']', 'focus', 'REAL', 'sacrifice', 'troops', 'fascinating', 'juxtaposition', 'government', 'assertion', 'war', 'surgical', 'precise', 'humane', 'versus', 'real', 'suffering', 'ground', 'Iraq', 'brilliant.In', 'era', 'media', 'outlets', 'are', 'controlled', 'giant', 'corporations', 'Moore', 'voice', 'irritating', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'refreshing', '[', 'Case', 'point', 'movie', 'was', 'be', 'released', 'originally', 'feisty', 'Disney', 'subsidiary', 'Miramax', 'Films', 'head', 'Disney', 'decided', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'controversial', 'reportedly', 'time', 'Disney', 'was', 'vying', 'tax', 'incentives', 'state', 'Florida', 'governor', 'Jeb', 'Bush', 'brother', 'George', 'W', ']']",Fahrenheit 9/11

We don't really hear them cheering and having a great ol' time, though. Instead, we hear director Moore lamenting about how the last four years have seemed like a big dream and to many of us in the audience who were ready to see this movie, it does indeed feel that way. I still remember George W. Bush making promises and proclaiming that he would &quot;be a uniter and not a divider&quot;. He also said he would bring dignity back to the White House...You can call this film a &quot;tired liberal argument&quot;, a &quot;liberal soapbox&quot;, or anything else that comes to mind, but you would be wrong on just about every front. Michael Moore may be a liberal, but he didn't say that liberals have the solution to everything. His interviewee's say that and some of the war-injured say that and the mother whose son was killed over the current struggle in Iraq say that. Moore's whole idea is to say that the man we have serving us in the White House is NOT the man for the job. For this, I applaud Moore and I call him a braver man than I. He hangs not just his private parts out there but his entire body.Michael Moore's documentary makes intelligent connections between the Bush White House and Saudi oil interests which include the Bin Laden family. He claims that one of Cheney's companies made a profit off of 9/11 due to new war contracts. He shows us that the war in Iraq is both unneccessary and quite deadly mainly because Saddam Hussein has nothing to do with 9/11 and never had the tools that terrorists would love to get their hands on (the famed &quot;WMD's&quot; that have become a household name).Of course, none of this will come as unfamiliar news since we have all heard the crazy things viewers have said about Moore and his ability to &quot;stretch and distort&quot; certain truths. Here, I've seen Moore do nothing other than what any other documentary filmmaker would do: persuade you to believe his viewpoint by shooting archival facts your way and showing you why you should care about it now. He has the right, as an American, to question his government. Everyone (even the Repub's) exercised this right not once(in 1992), not twice(in 1996), but THREE TIMES (in 2000). We do so everytime we vote. You will probably do it again in 2004 when you choose your leader for the next four years.What Michael Moore does NOT do is exactly what Pro-Bush sheep say he and most liberals do: Michael Moore does not hate our military. He does not use 9/11 to his advantage or to any other advantage. He follows the military on their exploits with curiosity and then questions why they continue to fight a war that doesn't need to be fought when the MILITARY begins to complain to the camera. Moore also meets a nice woman named Linda Lipscomb who works in the Unemployment Office in Flint, Michigan, the subject of Moore's very first movie. Her son has gone to war in Iraq and she supports him and the reason the troops fight all the way. She even confesses that she misunderstood the anti-war protesters, saying that she considered their protests as &quot;a slap in the face&quot; until she realized that they were protesting the reason Bush led us in there.Later in the film, we discover that her son was killed in Karballah in a Blackhawk helicopter downed by enemy fire. She no longer supports the war or Bush and her and Moore take a march up to the White House which is almost cast as a big, powerful building that taunts its opponents. It's been fenced off completely (due to construction) so nobody can even approach the gates and that's when Linda's emotions begin to get the best of her as she sobs uncontrollably, remembering her son, doubling over in an almost painful way. This brought tears to the eyes of many an audience member, including me. Not because I don't like the war but because you realize that actual human beings are needlessly dying.Moore also does NOT sympathize with terrorists. He wisely does not show what we have already witnessed hundreds of times: the planes crashing into the World Trade Center. Instead, he lets us HEAR it with just a dark screen to keep us company. He points out that over 3,000 people, even a friend of his was killed in the attacks. He points out that Bush rightly sent troops to into Afghanistan to &quot;smoke 'em out&quot; (repeated over and over by Bush in a cleverly-edited sequence) but that he sent only a mere 11,000 troops. This is incredibly alarming since, a) Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban are supposedly still alive and well in Afghanistan and b) just under 1,000,000 troops are in Iraq, fighting seemingly multiplying insurgent forces everyday.Michael Moore's film takes you on an emotional journey that will force you to laugh, make you cry, and encourage you to get mad and do something about the sad state of affairs in this country. This, despite what others will no doubt say, is a very important film and one of immense patriotic passion and such power that you might find that you've made an impression of yourself in your theater seat by the movie's end.**** out of ****--Matt(Note: There are two sides to every story. Many call Moore a liar.

630084,AESY8NCX6VS6O,B00005JNEI,M. Burns,"[2, 11]","The smartest comment in Michael Moore's newest one-sided diatribe comes not from a high-level anti-Bush official or Moore or some Washington insider...but George W. Bush himself. Moore is attempting to get a word from him and - get this - Bush says, ""You'd better behave yourself. And get a real job!"" That's somewhat the way I felt after sitting through two mind-numbingly boring hours of 9/11 - the movie that won the Palme D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Beats me. In this little review, I don't plan on discussing Moore politics, things said in the movie, whether the fat schlub is right or not, or anything like that. I'm treating it like it deserves to be treated (and how it wasn't treated at Cannes) - as a movie. And as a movie, it's dull.And that's really the most surprising thing about Fahrenheit. I went into it prepared to go any way on the movie, though, I admit, I'm not a fan of the way Moore manipulates facts (read: lies) to get his point across. I possibly anticipated getting upset with his blazingly manipulated facts, manipulative filmmaking techniques...but no; that stuff is alright in some ways. The movie is just a snoozer. Which surprises me, considering Bowling For Columbine, though shamelessly manipulative and annoying, was at least highly enjoyable and full of a zest for filmmaking. I recently commented on someone's xanga, kind of defending Moore, saying that even though he does bend the truth, at least he does it with a passion and flare that some fictional filmmakers can't match. CrzyMuthaRugger just needs to see Fahrenheit to prove me wrong. Though Moore seems more fired up about this whole situation than anything else he's ever done, the movie feels like a two-hour-long Dateline special. And I think I just insulted Dateline.But don't think that he's thrown his shameless audience manipulation away for, well, boredom; that's here too. In the entire first half of the film, he spends a great deal of time putting thoughts into Bush's head via narration. I don't like the hick, but it's just plain unfair; Moore has no idea what the man was/is thinking, and it's not something that should have been done in this documentary. At one point, Moore asks, paraphrased, ""Would it be rude to say that the Bushes wake up in the morning and think 'What's best for the Saudi's,' not 'What's good for the United States?'"" I said out loud, ""Yes, it is rude."" But Moore has a penchant for turning rudeness into snarky charm, something that worked for a good deal of Columbine. In a scene toward the end, he goes to Congressmen asking if they'd enlist their kids to fight in the war in Iraq. Think about this for a second: would any person, without hesitation, stand on a street corner and sign their kids up for the war just like that? No, and Moore knows that. He just does it anyways, to get them running away on film (running away is the best idea anyone Moore attempts to interview can have).The only section of the movie that really, truly works is a sequence past the halfway point in which Moore explores how the U.S. began the war with Iraq. Here, the dude really has some solid ground on which to stand, and he does relay the facts with the video footage in a way that reminded me of what a good documentary can do. And I give him his due credit for that. But it all goes down the tube soon when he starts making broad parallells in his narration and veering off again...and 9/11 is where it was when it started: Dullsville.Don't think that I'm giving this a bad review because I don't agree with Moore. I do - Bush is a douchebag, and I hope come November things change. But just because this movie loosely follows my views doesn't mean it's automatically good. Fahrenheit 9/11, a film that could have been intriguing, exciting and relentlessly probing is simply a monotonous presentation of facts that achieves the full effect of numbness upon the viewer. I am baffled at the fact that this won at Cannes, but it's pretty easy to explain why: the coveted Palme D'Or is nothing more than a show of political support. That's kind of sad, considering the fact that I'm sure there were many other films that had a zest for filmmaking, a desire to tell a story, and the power to move their audiences. Fahrenheit 9/11, despite what you've heard, has none.

630091,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B00005JNEI,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[7, 11]","The above quote, from George Orwell's fictional book ""1984"" that was published at the onset of the Cold War in 1949, is a sad commentary quoted in Michael Moore's 2004 documentary entitled ""Fahrenheit 9/11"".  The book, which depicts a dystopian society that is always at war that is never meant to be won, is used as a comparison by Michael Moore with the current state of affairs by the U.S. Government.  The documentary begins with a brief look at the highly questionable results of the 2000 presidential election that permitted with the candidate with the fewer number of popular votes, George W. Bush, to become president of the United States.  While on a very lengthy vacation at his ranch in Crawford, Texas in August, 2001, Mr. Bush ignored U.S. Government warnings about a potential terrorist attack that would use hijacked airplanes only weeks before the dreaded terrorist attack of September 11, 2001 that saw the destruction of the World Trade Center in NYC, an attack on the Pentagon and leaving about 3000 people dead.  The notion that all domestic flights in the U.S. were grounded immediately after the attack is incorrect, as a number of secret flights carrying Saudi citizens (including blood relatives of Osama bin Laden, the man responsible for the attack) were allowed to leave the U.S.  Hence, Mr. Bush ensured that even though 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11, 2001 were Saudi citizens, no departing Saudi citizens could be questioned by U.S. law enforcement officials that were investigating the horrific attack.Within weeks of the attack and Americans living in fear, it was then easy for Mr. Bush and his White House staff to promote the Patriot Act (especially former Attorney General John Ashcroft), which reduced the rights, freedoms and privacy of all Americans and the Taliban-controlled nation of Afghanistan was attacked by U.S. forces to weed out al Queda terrorists.  However, as Michael Moore points out in his documentary, some officials in Bush's administration wanted a bigger target to attack, and the preferred choice was Iraq.  In less than a year, Mr. Bush and other White House officials were repeatedly calling for an invasion into Iraq; and on March 19, 2003, they got their wish as U.S. forces did invade that nation, which had never attacked the U.S. The justification used by Mr. Bush and other White House officials to invade Iraq was the claim that its former regime possessed weapons of mass destruction in violation of United Nations resolutions.  However, in the months following the invasion, no such weapons were ever found, nor were any facilities found where any such weapons could be built.  In other words, Mr. Bush lied in order to justify the sending of thousands of U.S. troops into harms way in costly war.  Since the invasion (at the time of writing this review), over 1870 American military servicemen and servicewomen have died, over 14000 have been wounded and an estimated 23000 to 25000 Iraqi civilians have been killed.  It is interesting, as Michael Moore pointed out in the documentary, that of all 535 members of both houses of Congress, only one (at the time it was filmed) had a son or daughter serving in the U.S. military in Iraq.  With Mr. Bush thwarting efforts to investigate the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack, the close ties between the Bush & bin Laden families and the involvement of Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney with the oil industry and military-industrial complex respectively, the reasons for invading Iraq become quite blurred; but the killing continues unabated while Osama bin Laden remains at large.Overall, I rate Michael Moore's 2004 documentary ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.  What has kept the U.S. a free country for more than 200 years is the right of its citizens to question the actions of the government, which is exactly what Michael Moore did in this very insightful documentary.  Just watch out for John Ashcroft singing.",5,"""The war is not meant to be won, it is meant to be continuous.""",1124755200,"08 23, 2005",2005,3978,"['above', 'quote', 'George', 'Orwell', 'fictional', 'book', '1984', 'was', 'published', 'onset', 'Cold', 'War', '1949', 'sad', 'commentary', 'quoted', 'Michael', 'Moore', '2004', 'documentary', 'entitled', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'book', 'dystopian', 'society', 'always', 'war', 'never', 'meant', 'be', 'won', 'used', 'comparison', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'current', 'state', 'affairs', 'U.S.', 'Government', 'documentary', 'begins', 'brief', 'look', 'highly', 'questionable', 'results', '2000', 'presidential', 'election', 'permitted', 'candidate', 'fewer', 'number', 'popular', 'votes', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'become', 'president', 'United', 'States', 'very', 'lengthy', 'vacation', 'ranch', 'Crawford', 'Texas', 'August', '2001', 'Mr.', 'Bush', 'ignored', 'U.S.', 'Government', 'warnings', 'potential', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'would', 'use', 'hijacked', 'airplanes', 'only', 'weeks', 'dreaded', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'September', '11', '2001', 'saw', 'destruction', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'NYC', 'attack', 'Pentagon', 'leaving', '3000', 'people', 'dead', 'notion', 'domestic', 'flights', 'U.S.', 'were', 'grounded', 'immediately', 'attack', 'incorrect', 'number', 'secret', 'flights', 'carrying', 'Saudi', 'citizens', 'including', 'blood', 'relatives', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Laden', 'man', 'responsible', 'attack', 'were', 'allowed', 'leave', 'U.S', 'Hence', 'Mr.', 'Bush', 'ensured', 'even', '15', '19', 'hijackers', 'September', '11', '2001', 'were', 'Saudi', 'citizens', 'departing', 'Saudi', 'citizens', 'could', 'be', 'questioned', 'U.S.', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officials', 'were', 'investigating', 'horrific', 'attack.Within', 'weeks', 'attack', 'Americans', 'living', 'fear', 'was', 'then', 'easy', 'Mr.', 'Bush', 'White', 'House', 'staff', 'promote', 'Patriot', 'Act', 'especially', 'former', 'Attorney', 'General', 'John', 'Ashcroft', 'reduced', 'rights', 'freedoms', 'privacy', 'Americans', 'Taliban-controlled', 'nation', 'Afghanistan', 'was', 'attacked', 'U.S.', 'forces', 'weed', 'out', 'al', 'Queda', 'terrorists', 'However', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'points', 'out', 'documentary', 'officials', 'Bush', 'administration', 'wanted', 'bigger', 'target', 'attack', 'preferred', 'choice', 'was', 'Iraq', 'less', 'year', 'Mr.', 'Bush', 'other', 'White', 'House', 'officials', 'were', 'repeatedly', 'calling', 'invasion', 'Iraq', 'March', '19', '2003', 'got', 'wish', 'U.S.', 'forces', 'did', 'invade', 'nation', 'had', 'never', 'attacked', 'U.S', 'justification', 'used', 'Mr.', 'Bush', 'other', 'White', 'House', 'officials', 'invade', 'Iraq', 'was', 'claim', 'former', 'regime', 'possessed', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'violation', 'United', 'Nations', 'resolutions', 'However', 'months', 'following', 'invasion', 'such', 'weapons', 'were', 'ever', 'found', 'were', 'facilities', 'found', 'where', 'such', 'weapons', 'could', 'be', 'built', 'other', 'words', 'Mr.', 'Bush', 'lied', 'order', 'justify', 'sending', 'thousands', 'U.S.', 'troops', 'harms', 'way', 'costly', 'war', 'invasion', 'time', 'writing', 'review', '1870', 'American', 'military', 'servicemen', 'servicewomen', 'have', 'died', '14000', 'have', 'been', 'wounded', 'estimated', '23000', '25000', 'Iraqi', 'civilians', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'interesting', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'pointed', 'out', 'documentary', '535', 'members', 'houses', 'Congress', 'only', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'filmed', 'had', 'son', 'daughter', 'serving', 'U.S.', 'military', 'Iraq', 'Mr.', 'Bush', 'thwarting', 'efforts', 'investigate', 'September', '11', '2001', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'close', 'ties', 'Bush', 'bin', 'Laden', 'families', 'involvement', 'Mr.', 'Bush', 'Mr.', 'Cheney', 'oil', 'industry', 'military-industrial', 'complex', 'respectively', 'reasons', 'invading', 'Iraq', 'become', 'quite', 'blurred', 'killing', 'unabated', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Laden', 'large.Overall', 'rate', 'Michael', 'Moore', '2004', 'documentary', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'resounding', '5', '5', 'stars', 'highly', 'recommend', 'What', 'kept', 'U.S.', 'free', 'country', 'more', '200', 'years', 'right', 'citizens', 'question', 'actions', 'government', 'exactly', 'what', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'did', 'very', 'insightful', 'documentary', 'Just', 'watch', 'out', 'John', 'Ashcroft', 'singing']",Fahrenheit 9/11

630094,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00005JNEI,Michael Crane,"[23, 35]","The most controversial film of the year has finally arrived to theatres.  It's the movie that A LOT of people don't want you to see, hence why it had to go through so many obstacles to get a public release.  It's also a movie that people cannot stop talking about, whether they love it or hate it.  What I'm talking about is none other than Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" which is an unrelenting assault on the Bush Administration.  There is a very clear purpose of this movie, and that is to show the incompetence and the unspeakable acts perpetrated by G.W. and company and their handling of the Iraq War.From the get-go, you know that Moore has an agenda and he doesn't shy away from it.  He never backs down from it, as well.  From the very first minute, President George W. Bush is shown to us in a very unfavorable fashion.  We see him as a slacker who really hates being at the White House since he's always vacationing.  We see him sit in a classroom for well over seven minutes when he is told that our country is under attack, holding a very bewildered expression on his face.  Moore brings us some pretty devastating evidence that points to a relationship between the Bush family and Saudi Arabia.  Not only that, but we are told that while every plane in the U.S. was grounded, the Bin Ladin Family was able to catch flights out of our country without ever being questioned by the FBI (according to Moore).  The film has some very humorous moments in it, which include Moore trying to get members of Congress to enlist their own children to go to Iraq--the expressions on their faces are absolutely priceless as they run away in horror and in disgust from Moore.  However, there are gut-wrenching and devastating moments like seeing dead and injured soldiers, and the breakdown of a mother who has lost her son in the war.  When you add all of these elements together, you get a very thought-provoking and disturbing portrait of the Bush Administration.Make no mistake, as Michael Moore never shies away from the fact that he has made this movie to get Bush out of office.  He admits that.  His agenda is always clear and he never tells you otherwise.  And yet, he doesn't just simply tell you that G.W. is an incompetent guy and leaves it at that.  He gives you his reasons and he backs them up with his evidence.  I cannot verify the accuracy of this film, as I am not a political analyst.  What I can verify is that Moore makes a pretty convincing case and this movie raises some serious accusations that really need to be answered, even if they only turn out to be nothing more than accusations in the end.Is this film nothing more than propaganda?  I don't think so.  Usually, propaganda is used in hopes that it will have everybody coming to the same conclusions.  You won't find that with this movie.  People who are for Bush will most likely still be for Bush after seeing the movie, and people who are against Bush will still resent Bush after the movie.  There is always a chance that the movie may change some people's opinions, but I don't really think it will change people's minds all that much.  However, what I do hope is that the film will have people thinking and asking the hard and tough questions that this administration should have to answer.I think that ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is a big triumph for Michael Moore.  He took a lot of chances and risks making this movie.  It is clear that it is a project that he absolutely believes in since he handles it with absolute care.  Whether you're on the Left or on the Right, I think this is something that should be seen by everyone, even if you don't agree with Moore's tactics or opinions.  Nobody should tell you how to feel about this movie, it should only be you who comes to such a decision.  A very well done and powerful presentation from Mr. Moore.  As always, he did not disappoint me. -Michael Crane",5,"""He did what anybody else would do... he went on vacation.""",1088985600,"07 5, 2004",2004,3888,"['most', 'controversial', 'film', 'year', 'finally', 'arrived', 'theatres', 'movie', 'LOT', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'hence', 'why', 'had', 'go', 'so', 'many', 'obstacles', 'get', 'public', 'release', 'also', 'movie', 'people', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'talking', 'love', 'hate', 'What', ""'m"", 'talking', 'none', 'other', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'unrelenting', 'assault', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'very', 'clear', 'purpose', 'movie', 'show', 'incompetence', 'unspeakable', 'acts', 'perpetrated', 'G.W', 'company', 'handling', 'Iraq', 'get-go', 'know', 'Moore', 'agenda', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'never', 'down', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'first', 'minute', 'President', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'shown', 'very', 'unfavorable', 'fashion', 'see', 'slacker', 'who', 'really', 'being', 'White', 'House', 'always', 'vacationing', 'see', 'sit', 'classroom', 'well', 'seven', 'minutes', 'when', 'told', 'country', 'attack', 'holding', 'very', 'bewildered', 'expression', 'face', 'Moore', 'pretty', 'devastating', 'evidence', 'relationship', 'Bush', 'family', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'told', 'plane', 'U.S.', 'was', 'grounded', 'Bin', 'Ladin', 'Family', 'was', 'able', 'catch', 'flights', 'country', 'ever', 'being', 'questioned', 'FBI', 'according', 'Moore', 'film', 'very', 'humorous', 'moments', 'include', 'Moore', 'trying', 'get', 'members', 'Congress', 'enlist', 'own', 'children', 'go', 'Iraq', 'expressions', 'are', 'absolutely', 'priceless', 'run', 'away', 'horror', 'disgust', 'Moore', 'However', 'are', 'gut-wrenching', 'devastating', 'moments', 'seeing', 'dead', 'injured', 'soldiers', 'breakdown', 'mother', 'who', 'lost', 'son', 'war', 'When', 'add', 'elements', 'together', 'get', 'very', 'thought-provoking', 'disturbing', 'portrait', 'Bush', 'Administration.Make', 'mistake', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'never', 'away', 'fact', 'made', 'movie', 'get', 'Bush', 'office', 'agenda', 'always', 'clear', 'never', 'otherwise', 'yet', ""n't"", 'just', 'simply', 'tell', 'G.W', 'incompetent', 'guy', 'reasons', 'up', 'evidence', 'can', 'not', 'verify', 'accuracy', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'political', 'analyst', 'What', 'can', 'verify', 'Moore', 'pretty', 'convincing', 'case', 'movie', 'serious', 'accusations', 'really', 'need', 'be', 'answered', 'even', 'only', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'accusations', 'end.Is', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'propaganda', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'Usually', 'propaganda', 'used', 'hopes', 'will', 'have', 'everybody', 'coming', 'same', 'conclusions', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'movie', 'People', 'who', 'are', 'Bush', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'still', 'be', 'Bush', 'seeing', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'Bush', 'will', 'still', 'resent', 'Bush', 'movie', 'always', 'chance', 'movie', 'may', 'change', 'people', 'opinions', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'will', 'change', 'people', 'minds', 'that', 'much', 'However', 'what', 'do', 'hope', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'people', 'thinking', 'asking', 'hard', 'tough', 'questions', 'administration', 'should', 'have', 'answer.I', 'think', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'big', 'triumph', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'took', 'lot', 'chances', 'risks', 'making', 'movie', 'clear', 'project', 'absolutely', 'absolute', 'care', ""'re"", 'Left', 'Right', 'think', 'something', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'everyone', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'Moore', 'tactics', 'opinions', 'Nobody', 'should', 'tell', 'how', 'feel', 'movie', 'should', 'only', 'be', 'who', 'such', 'decision', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'powerful', 'presentation', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'always', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', '-Michael', 'Crane']",Fahrenheit 9/11

630099,AL4MKKO24563R,B00005JNEI,Michael K. Beusch,"[27, 44]","At about the midway point of Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore includes a clip of an interview with Britney Spears. In it, Spears voices full confidence in President Bush and his administration and says that she believes everything he says. If enough people in this country see Fahrenheit 9/11, Spears is going to be among a very, very, very small minority in the United States.Moore clearly shows how the Bush administration, from day one (and even before that), has manipulated facts, played on the nation's fears and flat-out lied to the American people in order to further its political and financial goals. With almost unnerving precision, Moore shows how the Bush family cultivated business ties with the Bin Laden family and sought to preserve those ties even after 9/11. Clips of testimony and interviews by members of the Bush administration asserting the claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction are followed by clips of those same people, before 9/11, asserting that Iraq had no such weapons. He shows how the Patriot Act has given the United Government license to pry into the private lives of its citizens and execute a measure of control and manipulation that should be illegal under the Constitution. And, in footage CBS, ABC, NBC and, especially, Fox News never show the American people, Moore documents how the war in Iraq has dessimated lives, both American and Iraqi.This is clearly Moore's most somber and sober film yet. Roger and Me, The Big One and even Bowling for Columbine had moments of great humor and big laughs. In contrast, even when Fahrenheit 9/11 uses humor, the film still maintains its tone of anger, anguish and despair over the corruption of the Bush Aministration and the lives lost or ruined by the war in Iraq. By the time Moore interviews the mother of a soldier killed in the war, the audience isn't laughing and is instead on the verge of tears.Moore thankfully spares the audience the horrible footage of 9/11/01, not because he feels it is irrelevant, but because he doesn't want to exploit our memories. The sounds of the attack, the reaction of bystanders to the horror and the grief of the survivors and family members of the victims tells the story powerfully. He knows that no one who was old enough to be aware what was happening that day will ever forget what they saw and what they felt.In contrast, the footage of the Americans and Iraqis killed and wounded shown is often very graphic in nature and might be too much for some viewers to handle. It shocked me, but I thought it was necessary to show how much the media, even the supposedly liberal leaning mainstream media, slanted its coverage, omitted footage that could be construed as un-American or negative in nature and essentially became an unofficial cheerleader for the Bush Administration's cause.By playing upon the nation's post 9/11 fears, the Bush administration was able to sell a war on Iraq that was already in the planning stages before the attacks. And worst of all, Moore shows that, in many instances, the root reason for waging war wasn't idealogical, but instead for financial gain through the awarding of fat government contracts to help rebuild Iraq. While watching Fahrenheit 9/11, I kept thinking of Donald Sutherland's statement in Oliver Stone's JFK that ""the organizing principle for any society is for war."" It's easy to dismiss such a statement when watching a dramatization. However, it's not nearly as easy when it's shoved into your face with supporting evidence during a documentary.Before I saw Fahrenheit 9/11, I expressed doubts that a documentary could influence an election. Now, however, I'm not so sure. Michael Moore has crafted a film that trashes President Bush, but presents a lot of evidence to back him up. George W. Bush had better hope that Britney Spears can get a lot of pro-Bush voters to the polls, because Fahrenheit 9/11 is going to make a lot of people angry at him.NOTE: My only criticism of Moore is that he berates Bush for the way he won the election in 2000 without also acknowledging that had Ralph Nader, who Moore strongly supported, not run, Bush might now be just an ex-Governor instead of President.",5,"Well, At Least Bush Has Britney Spears' Vote ...",1088553600,"06 30, 2004",2004,4186,"['midway', 'point', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'Moore', 'clip', 'interview', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'Spears', 'full', 'confidence', 'President', 'Bush', 'administration', 'everything', 'enough', 'people', 'country', 'see', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'Spears', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'small', 'minority', 'United', 'States.Moore', 'clearly', 'how', 'Bush', 'administration', 'day', 'one', 'even', 'manipulated', 'facts', 'played', 'nation', 'fears', 'flat-out', 'lied', 'American', 'people', 'order', 'further', 'political', 'financial', 'goals', 'almost', 'unnerving', 'precision', 'Moore', 'how', 'Bush', 'family', 'cultivated', 'business', 'ties', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'family', 'sought', 'preserve', 'ties', 'even', '9/11', 'Clips', 'testimony', 'interviews', 'members', 'Bush', 'administration', 'asserting', 'claim', 'Iraq', 'had', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'are', 'followed', 'clips', 'same', 'people', '9/11', 'asserting', 'Iraq', 'had', 'such', 'weapons', 'how', 'Patriot', 'Act', 'given', 'United', 'Government', 'license', 'pry', 'private', 'lives', 'citizens', 'execute', 'measure', 'control', 'manipulation', 'should', 'be', 'illegal', 'Constitution', 'footage', 'CBS', 'ABC', 'NBC', 'especially', 'Fox', 'News', 'never', 'show', 'American', 'people', 'Moore', 'documents', 'how', 'war', 'Iraq', 'dessimated', 'lives', 'American', 'Iraqi.This', 'clearly', 'Moore', 'most', 'somber', 'sober', 'film', 'yet', 'Roger', 'Me', 'Big', 'One', 'even', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'had', 'moments', 'great', 'humor', 'big', 'laughs', 'contrast', 'even', 'when', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'uses', 'humor', 'film', 'still', 'tone', 'anger', 'anguish', 'despair', 'corruption', 'Bush', 'Aministration', 'lives', 'lost', 'ruined', 'war', 'Iraq', 'time', 'Moore', 'mother', 'soldier', 'killed', 'war', 'audience', ""n't"", 'laughing', 'instead', 'verge', 'tears.Moore', 'thankfully', 'audience', 'horrible', 'footage', '9/11/01', 'not', 'irrelevant', ""n't"", 'want', 'exploit', 'memories', 'sounds', 'attack', 'reaction', 'bystanders', 'horror', 'grief', 'survivors', 'family', 'members', 'victims', 'story', 'powerfully', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'aware', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'day', 'will', 'ever', 'forget', 'what', 'saw', 'what', 'felt.In', 'contrast', 'footage', 'Americans', 'Iraqis', 'killed', 'wounded', 'shown', 'often', 'very', 'graphic', 'nature', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'viewers', 'handle', 'shocked', 'thought', 'was', 'necessary', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'media', 'even', 'supposedly', 'liberal', 'leaning', 'mainstream', 'media', 'slanted', 'coverage', 'omitted', 'footage', 'could', 'be', 'construed', 'un-American', 'negative', 'nature', 'essentially', 'became', 'unofficial', 'cheerleader', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'cause.By', 'playing', 'nation', 'post', '9/11', 'fears', 'Bush', 'administration', 'was', 'able', 'sell', 'war', 'Iraq', 'was', 'already', 'planning', 'stages', 'attacks', 'worst', 'Moore', 'many', 'instances', 'root', 'reason', 'waging', 'war', 'was', ""n't"", 'idealogical', 'instead', 'financial', 'gain', 'awarding', 'fat', 'government', 'contracts', 'help', 'rebuild', 'Iraq', 'watching', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'kept', 'thinking', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'statement', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'JFK', 'organizing', 'principle', 'society', 'war', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'statement', 'when', 'watching', 'dramatization', 'However', 'not', 'nearly', 'easy', 'when', 'shoved', 'face', 'supporting', 'evidence', 'documentary.Before', 'saw', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'expressed', 'doubts', 'documentary', 'could', 'influence', 'election', 'Now', 'however', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'crafted', 'film', 'President', 'Bush', 'lot', 'evidence', 'back', 'up', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'had', 'better', 'hope', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'can', 'get', 'lot', 'pro-Bush', 'voters', 'polls', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'going', 'make', 'lot', 'people', 'angry', 'him.NOTE', 'only', 'criticism', 'Moore', 'Bush', 'way', 'won', 'election', '2000', 'also', 'acknowledging', 'had', 'Ralph', 'Nader', 'who', 'Moore', 'strongly', 'supported', 'not', 'run', 'Bush', 'might', 'now', 'be', 'just', 'ex-Governor', 'instead', 'President']",Fahrenheit 9/11

630101,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00005JNEI,Miles D. Moore,"[8, 15]","If I were judging Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" strictly for its quality, I would give it four stars rather than five. It meanders too much in its mid-section, as Moore simply goes on too long with his polemics about President Bush and his ties to the bin Laden family and other wealthy Saudis. ""Bowling for Columbine"" had a more concentrated impact and took (or at least seemed to take) fewer cheap shots. But for historical importance, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" flies off the charts in a way that few films in history ever have. Is Moore preaching to the anti-Bush choir here? Of course, but he does so in a way that his opponents cannot afford to ignore--in a way that Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison and Harriet Beecher Stowe preached against slavery in the 1850s. That's because Moore's essential purpose is bigger than simply to bash Bush; once Moore gets to the war in Iraq, he sweeps away all criticism in a heartbreaking, horrifying depiction of the carnage of war. (Warning: Moore does not flinch from showing the burned, mangled bodies of U.S. soldiers and Iraqi civilians, so the squeamish should stay away.) The film's most heartbreaking section depicts Lila Lipscomb--a nice, upright, patriotic mom from Moore's home town of Flint, Mich., who slowly succumbs to grief and despair as she comes to the realization that her son died fighting an unnecessary, ill-conceived war. (Some have accused Moore of using Lipscomb for propaganda purposes. Did he? Perhaps. But Lipscomb clearly wanted her story to be told.) Of course Moore wouldn't be Moore without a few merry pranks. At one point, finding out that none of the senators who voted for the Patriot Act had actually read it, he rents an ice cream truck and rides around Capitol Hill reading the bill's text over the truck's loudspeaker. A little later, he and a disillusioned young Marine walk around Capitol Hill, trying to get congressmen to sign their children up for military service in Iraq. But those merry pranks, as always, have a point as deadly serious as the war footage. You can quibble with specific points of this movie, and it can't be taken as straight reporting. But as an ""op-ed piece,"" as Moore himself calls it, it makes a very persuasive case that our current president and his Cabinet have been led by greed, stupidity and vanity into making grievous errors of judgment that emperil this country.

Well, the movie was very entertaining (very important for documentaries) and informative at the same time. Many documentaries are all facts but no fun which is almost pointless because no one wantys to listen to the monotone Biology teacher talk about the wild life. (or Ben Stein sell Eye Contacts or whatever) The movie at time can be bias which isn't anything abnormal. (Spoiler alert, everyone has a personal bias of some degree, so get over it) However, once again Michael Moore does not pull any punches.

It was so confusing I had to sit down and write out a flow chart of who was who and what each connection was to each other.  That was the only way I could even attempt to grasp this huge conspiracy theory.This is Michael Moore's masterpiece, a throughly researched and picked apart documentary of how September 11th could have would have should have and how it's lead to our Iraq occupation.  After having watched this, I didn't feel one way or another about it.  I don't feel conspired against, I don't feel deceived, and I don't feel angry.  It was clear to me after the Gulf War of the early 90s that we thought there was going to be a revolution and Saddam Hussein would be ousted by his own people, but it didn't happen.  We were wrong, it was a lightening war, and now our gas prices are through the roof.  We thought that we were going to find Ousama Bin Lauden quickly, we haven't yet.  And, perhaps most importantly of all, Michael Moore wanted to vote out George W Bush, and he didn't.Having looked back on all these things, I am rather amazed yet at the same time I feel an odd understanding of things.  The reason I do not give this movie 5 stars is because it is a personal attack against George W and not truly against his political stance.  On the day that the towers were hit, he was in an elementary school class and they timed his reaction once the news was whispered to him.  If I were him, I would sit there with a blank look on my face too.  Who's in charge here?  I AM.  I'd just be glad I didn't wet my pants.  He likes to portray George as stupid, I don't believe he's stupid.  And when I am looking at the state of the economy I don't blame him for it unlike everyone else.  I blame myself, like a lot of others should do.  You choose so many things for yourselves, world.  You blame George for your state of unemployment, rising costs, and dwindling finances, but those who yell the loudest don't get off their lazy asses and put our shoulders to the wheel.And, I write this long after George won the second election.  That I was shocked at, because the people seemed so angry.  But why did he win again when Michael Moore made such an effort to call for a coupe?  Because people are angry, but they don't care enough to vote.  I was amazed as angry as people are that they simply do not care.Still, this is a good movie.

Despite the almost weekly barrage of negative news reports, Govt. reports, Book releases and even movie releases, depicting a President that is woefully over his head, these supporters are as rock solid, ""steadfast"" if you will, in their faith of Bush as many of them are in their fundamental faith of God.Is this good? Well maybe. It shows character but it also infers a certain amount of innocence. President Bush could be characterized as ""steadfast"". Well, Merriam-Webster defines ""steadfast"" thusly, firmly fixed in place : IMMOVABLE b : not subject to change. As you can see being ""steadfast"" depending on application can be a good or bad thing. Let's look at a related word ""intransigence"" refusing to compromise or to abandon an extreme position or attitude : UNCOMPROMISING b : IRRECONCILABLE. To the Bushphobes, this word describes President Bush more accurately. If you are a Bushphile have you really checked the overwhelming amount of unfavorable independent information coming forth. Have you read or viewed any of the less than positive information available regarding our President, have you seen Fahrenheit 9/11?Fahrenheit 9/11In a surreal scene, our President, G.W. Bush is reading a book to a class of first graders in a Florida elementary school. After having been told that an airplane had hit a World Trade Center Tower in New York previously, George went into the classroom as not to keep these six and seven year olds waiting. While in the classroom, he is informed by a subordinate, that a second plane has hit the other tower. Does George excuse himself stating that he has an emergency to attend too? No, George sits there, sometimes reading ""My Pet Goat"", sometimes staring off, for almost SEVEN MINUTES!Michael Moore's controversial film begins by rehashing the equally controversial and extremely polarizing 2000 Presidential election. Though rushing through the Florida shenanigans, making some interesting points but with time restraints barely touching on the variety of previously reported inconsistencies.From there, Moore moves on to the 9/11 catastrophe itself and thankfully, he tastefully refrains from showing actual footage of the disaster instead concentrating on bystanders reactions, generally showing people looking up but resisting the temptation to go there with the camera.Then, in the previously mentioned schoolroom scene, Moore suggests that maybe the President is reflecting upon his missteps, such as not having at least one meeting with his own head of counterterrorism or not reading the briefing of Aug 6, 2001 stating al Qeada intended to attack the United States soon by hijacking airplanes.Michael Moore goes on to characterize other facets of previous and following events which, in his and my opinion, illustrate the questionable actions of the President and or his staff.Moore indicates that in each of G.W.'s failed business ventures he had Saudi and even the bin Laden family financial backing, which in Moore's opinion have extended a dark Bush/Saudi/bin Laden alliance, ultimately the reason 142 Saudis including bin Laden family members being rushed out of the United States after Sept. 13th.But Moore's real salvos are reserved for the ill conceived, ill planned and ultimately unnecessary invasion of Iraq. This segment starts out with White House, counterterrorism chief, Richard Clark basically saying the Bush administration wanted to and planned to invade Iraq from before they took office and that Afghanistan and al-Qeada were an inconvenient diversion. Of course Moore extrapolates that for his case that Bush marginalized the continuing hunt for bin Laden to gear up for the now infamous Bush War.But hey, I'm giving away too much of this fascinating movie. See It!CONCLUSIONMichael Moore is truly in his element as he excoriates the clueless G.W. Bush. This movie reminds me of a roast except for this recipient, the jibes are real and not in fun, however, there are indeed many humorous moments albeit satirical in nature.My favorite humorous part was when Moore initially depicted a burning map of Afghanistan set to the theme song from the popular TV show, Bonanza, then showing the cast (G.W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfield and Tony Blair) dressed in Bonanza style cowboy attire.Of course, the Bush clan paints this movie as a pack of scurrilous lies with no basis in truth but then, why does it jive with the facts I do know and why does it have a conspicuous ring of truth?Back to our Bushphiles. If you intend to vote for G.W. but haven't seen or read anything negative about the President, at least see this movie. This is the most important presidential election I can remember in forty years. If you see this movie and still want to vote for Bush, fine I can live with that.

The facts that Moore details in this film, the myriad of connections between the Bush family and powerful families in Saudi Arabia, including the bin Ladens, the events surrounding the virtual overthrow of free and fair elections in 2000, the lies promoted by the administration in order to promote a pre-planned war with Iraq, the feeble attempts to bring to justice those responsible for the attacks and gross mismanagement of the so-called war on terror, the rape of the US constitution and erosion of civil liberties after 9-11, the ignorance, hypocrisy, and above all the gross arrogance that President Bush and his cronies have displayed for the citizens of this country and the world, even if only 10% of it were true, would STILL make the Bush Administration (Corporation, perhaps, more fittingly) the most corrupt, devisive, disingenuous, immoral and socially destructive administration to ever hold power in the United States.Given the current state of the American media, where the ability to question what our government tells us has know become almost non-existent, Moore's film comes as a much needed voice of reason and sanity at a time in American history that is most dark. Some may come away from this film thinking that the forces of evil will always triumph, which is understandable considering the events of the last four years; however, this film also shows that there are still many people willing to stand up and fight for those sacred American ideals of freedom and justice for all, no matter how determined the powerful interests are to silence them. As citizens in a free society it is our duty as Americans to be informed about the events that Moore chronicles and whether one is a republican, democrat or independent, it is every person's responsibility to face the ugly facts presented here. In this film Michael Moore has simply given a perspective that is all but dead in American journalism; it is up to each American to determine what those facts mean to us. No matter how strong the forces of evil seem to become, they can only attain and extend their power with the willing assent of the individuals in society, which is ultimately where the true power lies. It is up to each of us to determine just how this power will be expressed, if we fail to recognize this we have only ourselves to blame for the results.",5,An Explosive Expose of Bush's Ominous Rise to Power,1089417600,"07 10, 2004",2004,2451,"['film', 'people', 'who', 'still', 'naively', 'believe', 'live', 'free', 'just', 'society', 'facts', 'Moore', 'details', 'film', 'myriad', 'connections', 'Bush', 'family', 'powerful', 'families', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'including', 'bin', 'Ladens', 'events', 'surrounding', 'virtual', 'overthrow', 'free', 'fair', 'elections', '2000', 'lies', 'promoted', 'administration', 'order', 'promote', 'pre-planned', 'war', 'Iraq', 'feeble', 'attempts', 'bring', 'justice', 'responsible', 'attacks', 'gross', 'mismanagement', 'so-called', 'war', 'terror', 'rape', 'US', 'constitution', 'erosion', 'civil', 'liberties', '9-11', 'ignorance', 'hypocrisy', 'gross', 'arrogance', 'President', 'Bush', 'cronies', 'have', 'displayed', 'citizens', 'country', 'world', 'even', 'only', '10', '%', 'were', 'true', 'would', 'STILL', 'make', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'Corporation', 'perhaps', 'more', 'fittingly', 'most', 'corrupt', 'devisive', 'disingenuous', 'immoral', 'socially', 'destructive', 'administration', 'ever', 'hold', 'power', 'United', 'States.Given', 'current', 'state', 'American', 'media', 'where', 'ability', 'question', 'what', 'government', 'know', 'become', 'almost', 'non-existent', 'Moore', 'film', 'much', 'needed', 'voice', 'reason', 'sanity', 'time', 'American', 'history', 'most', 'dark', 'may', 'come', 'away', 'film', 'thinking', 'forces', 'evil', 'will', 'always', 'triumph', 'understandable', 'considering', 'events', 'last', 'four', 'years', 'however', 'film', 'also', 'are', 'still', 'many', 'people', 'willing', 'stand', 'up', 'fight', 'sacred', 'American', 'ideals', 'freedom', 'justice', 'matter', 'how', 'determined', 'powerful', 'interests', 'are', 'silence', 'citizens', 'free', 'society', 'duty', 'Americans', 'be', 'informed', 'events', 'Moore', 'chronicles', 'one', 'republican', 'democrat', 'independent', 'person', 'responsibility', 'face', 'ugly', 'facts', 'presented', 'here', 'film', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'simply', 'given', 'perspective', 'dead', 'American', 'journalism', 'up', 'American', 'determine', 'what', 'facts', 'mean', 'matter', 'how', 'strong', 'forces', 'evil', 'seem', 'become', 'can', 'only', 'attain', 'extend', 'power', 'willing', 'assent', 'individuals', 'society', 'ultimately', 'where', 'true', 'power', 'up', 'determine', 'just', 'how', 'power', 'will', 'be', 'expressed', 'fail', 'recognize', 'have', 'only', 'blame', 'results']",Fahrenheit 9/11

630118,A1SHPX0VCXMRXT,B00005JNEI,"Mr. S. A. Lukacs ""Simbob""","[2, 14]","When watching any Michael Moore documentary, it is very difficult to seperate the politics that inform the film with the actual filmmaking style. Just glancing across the other reviews it is easy to see that he divides people perhaps even more than George W. himself. But are these differences purely down to politics, rather than filmmaking. It would not suprise me to discover that those who so fervently defend the film are Bush sceptics, and those that attack it so vigorously are at least partially behind their president. It is very difficult to make seperate the rhetoric from the technique, but I will aim to do so.Firstly, I should declare that I am staunchly against the war in Iraq. I have attended a protest march when Bush came to London and have not wavered in my stance. However, I have wavered in my stance on Mr. Moore since seeing his One Man Show at the Roundhouse Theatre, reading his books and seeing his latest documentaries, allied with a bit of background research. And so, with this rather rambling introduction, we come to Fahrenheit 9/11.Fahrenheit 9/11 is almost a companion piece to Moore's earlier film, Bowling for Columbine, trading on similar themes of fear, misinformation and corporate irresponsibility. However, while Columbine was sprawling, scattershot and taking aim at more targets than an Olympic archer, there is no doubt that Fahrenheit has it's sights set on one prize - Mr. Bush. And boy, does it get ugly.The film contains copious amounts of footage of Bush appearing stupid, arrogant, insecure, cold and many other negative adjectives. It also attempts to put across the opinion that since 9/11, the Bush administration has used fear to push through a very hardline agenda, culminating with the war in Iraq. Much of this argument is very powerful. Some of it, however, is not.In one respect, Fahrenheit is one of Moore's more restrained works. He keeps himself off camera much more (some of Columbine's more mawkish moments involved Moore pushing himself as a ""man-of-the-people"" at every opportunity, which considering his alleged behaviour at this years' Cannes seems in hindsight a bit rich), and his subject matter is definately more focused, but it also contains some of his most blatantly manipulative work - in particular the scene where the mother of a dead American soldier (who was fighting in Iraq), goes to Washington to protest. When Moore's camera watches as she breaks down, the scene appears to achieve nothing more than make one woman very upset. It is also very crass, insensitive, and devoid of any shred of intellectual argument. Yes, it is very sad that a mother has lost her son, but showing her crying does not automatically make the war wrong. It is also very patronising to assume that the audience cannot comprehend the complexities of the war, and that you have to reduce the entire argument into a purely emotional, and quite crude, stunt.Having said this, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the film also contains some very powerful sequences, in particular the reconstruction of 9/11 with sound only over a black screen. As with several sequences from Columbine, it sends a shiver down your spine, and reminds you that when he restrains himself, Moore can be a very affecting filmmaker. Another effective moment is some disturbingly frank soldiers discussing their choice of music when going into battle. Suffice to say, it is alarmingly tasteless, and the scene serves as a damning indictment of the mindset of some of the troops.Another problem arises with the attacks on Bush. As I stated earlier, I find the man a menace to the world - and the footage of him is very masterfully assembled; both funny and frightening in equal measure. However, it is difficult to see how this boils down to anything more than just a personal attack on the President. The man himself is a prime target for such attacks, and they are legitimate, but the film's continuing reliance on this seems to indicate either an unwillingness or an inability to engage with the subject on any kind of advanced intellectual level, and comes across purely as a more sophisticated version of name calling. This again seems a rather patronising over simplification of the issues.The main problem is the terribly one sided nature of the opinions being aired. Audience's should be given enough credit to judge both sides of an argument and come to their own conclusions. This is obviously not on Moore's agenda, and indeed filmmakers right the way back to Eisenstein have used film to push their particular ideologies, but Moore frequently undermines himself by lurching into ill concieved, borderline extremist tirades. This is made the more frustrating by the fact that he also makes very pertinent points, and is clearly a very gifted filmmaker and producer of propoganda. It is easy, though, to see why many (even Bush haters) find him difficult to stomach, and why many find it easy to dismiss him as a ""nut"" or simply ignore him. There are enough right wing nuts out there, so maybe having a few left wing ones is no bad thing. It could be argued, though, that such basic, simplified, and (dare I say it) sometimes inaccurate and purposefully misleading arguments do more harm to the cause than good.Overall, Fahrenheit is another solid, well constrcuted, frequently funny, and sometimes moving film from Moore. However, it's arguments are extremely light weight and one sided, and it is by no means Moore's best work (Columbine, despite it's lack of focus is much more compelling; and Roger and Me remains his masterpiece). If you want a masterclass in propoganda - then this is the film for you. If you want a well thought out, balanced, intelligent and well informed argument, then you would be best advised to look elsewhere.",3,Moore of the same.,1096502400,"09 30, 2004",2004,5772,"['When',

630119,A1KI6L82M5RAHQ,B00005JNEI,mr. snrub,"[16, 31]","Michael Moore's FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is definitely essential viewing for anyone who claims to call themselves American. Even after ""President"" Bush's recent re-election, anyone who felt that re-electing him was a good idea needs to see this movie.It begins by presenting proof that George W. Bush and Dick Cheney did indeed cheat their way into the White House in the 2000 presidential election. How so? By disenfranchising thousands of Floridian Democrats who were not Bush supporters (""You can usually tell 'em by the color of their skin"" Moore points out) with the help of his brother, Florida Governor Jeb Bush. And, with the help of Knucklehead Bush Sr.'s Supreme Court buddies, settle the election in Bush's favor.Moore then takes us to what is easily the darkest day yet in the 21st Century - September 11, 2001.But, there are three key facts that the Bush Administration has supressed from the American public since 9/11.1.) A month ahead of time, Bush, Cheney, and all the White House underlings were well aware that Al Qaeda, under the leadership of Osama bin Laden, was planiing to launch a massive attack on the United States. Bush apparently didn't want to lift a finger to do anything. Ya know, that might interfere with his vacation.2.) As the terrorist attacks took place, Bush was reading MY PET GOAT with some Floridian elemetary school kids. What e was even doing there to start with is a complete mystery to me, but what is more infuriating is that after being informed of the attacks, Bush continued to linger in the classroom for 7 minutes -SEVEN MINUTES!!!!!!!!! - before getting up and doing something. Any staunch Bush supporter will probably say ""He'd be scaring the little children."" What's more important in that situation-Not scaring the kids, or saving the lives of all those people?3.) The Bush family has had long term relationships with the bin Laden family, all in the interest of money. They have had investments from the bin Laden's in Bush's oil franchises for some thime (this could explain Bush's tip-toeing around the use of alternative, non-polluting energy sources.) Two days after 9/11, Bush had several dozen wealthy Saudis, including 24 members of the bin Laden family, transported out of the United States, when they may have been able to lead us to Osama bin Laden, all at the behest of the Saudi government, who, of course, have some financial sway over the Bushes.That's all I really need to say in this review. The film really speaks for itself, and I don't want to take any of Michael Moore's investagatory credit from him. Bottom line-Forget what you think of Michael Moore.

It is this sentiment that led Thomas Paine to say, ""It is the duty of the patriot to protect his country from its government."" Noam Chomsky, a critic of American foreign policy, writes:The concept ""anti-American"" is an interesting one. The counterpart is used only in totalitarian states or military dictatorships... Thus, in the old Soviet Union, dissidents were condemned as ""anti-Soviet."" That's a natural usage among people with deeply rooted totalitarian instincts, which identify state policy with the society, the people, the culture.In contrast, people with even the slightest concept of democracy treat such notions with ridicule and contempt. Suppose someone in Italy who criticizes Italian state policy were condemned as ""anti-Italian."" It would be regarded as too ridiculous even to merit laughter. Maybe under Mussolini, but surely not otherwise.It's pretty obvious that the critics of this movie who call Moore Anti-American can't see beyond their Republican noses. Yes, you can be a critic of the American government and a patriot at the same time. Wow! What a concept!

We also do trade with Vietnam, as if they are no longer Communist. Does something stink here? Trouble is, we have had a government that for a long, long time, we can't trust around the corner, and an uneducated citizenry with a very short memory.

It is more of an editorial than a documentary in that it takes certain facts from a large body of information, and uses it to argue several viewpoints.  These are that the Bush administration did not take seriously warnings about the threat of Al Queda, the Bush administration did not react fast enough or with enough power to destroy the Taliban in Afghanistan, the Bush administration mistakenly went after Saddam Hussein, and had been planning this for a while, and that the Bush administration's ties with the Saudi royal family is biasing them from really going after the threat of Al Queda and those within Saudi Arabia who support it.  Each of these points is argued in other movies, documentary shows, magazine articles and books.  Examples of the latter are referenced occasionally in this movie.  What this movie does is pull many of these sources together, and present them in a cogent manner.  What the movie fails at is to put forward a sense of objectivity.  From the get-go, the audience can clearly tell that Mr. Moore has no liking of G. W. Bush.  The movie makes little attempt to explain the reasoning of the president or his advisers.  Because of this, the arguments of this movie should be taken with a grain of salt.This movie was released in 2003 after the Iraq War began, and the DVD came out in 2004, probably in hopes of affecting the US national elections.  The election did not turn out as Mr. Moore had hoped, but the failures of the US occupation of Iraq, and the resurgence of the Taliban can only lend credence to the points of this movie.",3,"Lots of good points, but overly biased",1172620800,"02 28, 2007",2007,1656,"['people', 'would', 'consider', 'movie', 'documentary', 'especially', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'more', 'editorial', 'documentary', 'certain', 'facts', 'large', 'body', 'information', 'argue', 'several', 'viewpoints', 'are', 'Bush', 'administration', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'seriously', 'warnings', 'threat', 'Al', 'Queda', 'Bush', 'administration', 'did', 'not', 'react', 'fast', 'enough', 'enough', 'power', 'destroy', 'Taliban', 'Afghanistan', 'Bush', 'administration', 'mistakenly', 'went', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'had', 'been', 'planning', 'while', 'Bush', 'administration', 'ties', 'Saudi', 'royal', 'family', 'biasing', 'really', 'going', 'threat', 'Al', 'Queda', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'who', 'support', 'points', 'argued', 'other', 'movies', 'documentary', 'shows', 'magazine', 'articles', 'books', 'Examples', 'latter', 'are', 'referenced', 'occasionally', 'movie', 'What', 'movie', 'pull', 'many', 'sources', 'together', 'present', 'cogent', 'manner', 'What', 'movie', 'put', 'forward', 'sense', 'objectivity', 'get-go', 'audience', 'can', 'clearly', 'tell', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'liking', 'G.', 'W.', 'Bush', 'movie', 'little', 'attempt', 'explain', 'reasoning', 'president', 'advisers', 'arguments', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'grain', 'salt.This', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '2003', 'Iraq', 'War', 'began', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', '2004', 'probably', 'hopes', 'affecting', 'US', 'national', 'elections', 'election', 'did', 'not', 'turn', 'out', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'had', 'hoped', 'failures', 'US', 'occupation', 'Iraq', 'resurgence', 'Taliban', 'can', 'only', 'lend', 'credence', 'points', 'movie']",Fahrenheit 9/11

630134,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B00005JNEI,Nicholas Carroll,"[21, 25]","For all the controversy surrounding this film, the point is almost missed with a lot of people.  Had the mainstream, corporate media had done their jobs, this documentary would not have to be made.  The myth of the liberal media is constantly perpetrated by the right wing to goad them into being more lax on the conservative views and tougher on liberal views to prove that the media is ""fair and balanced.""  Had the media been liberal, there seriously would have been a tougher fight and challenge to the Bush administration in the days following the 2000 elections.  The lies of the Bush campaign would have been more fodder than Gore's exaggerations regarding Love Story, Love canal, and the Internet.  The most enlightening thing about this film is that I never knew that no Senator sided with members of the black caucus in the U.S. House to formally protest the 2000 elections in Florida (the disenfranchisement of the African American vote).  Why didn't Senator Feingold, the conscience of the Senate, come to their aid?  Is the U.S. Senate that cliquey that they can just tell members of Congress to sit down and shut up if no Senator signed their protest petition?  This was all new to me, because no where in our ""liberal media"" was that story ever mentioned.  Since I don't have cable, I can't see CSPAN to know what's going on in the bowels of our government.  For that reason alone, I'm grateful to Moore for bringing it to our attention.My favorite scene in this film is the use of Bush's ""Top Gun"" type flight to the USS Abraham Lincoln to pronounce ""Mission Accomplished"" in Iraq, just a month and a half after the war began, and when just around 100 military members lost their lives.  It was a footage that Republicans hoped to use at their Convention but backfired because of the mess Iraq has become.  What made this footage even more brilliant was Moore's selection of the song from ""Greatest American Hero"" (""Believe it or not"") to illustrate his point (I especially loved the line, ""it should have been somebody else""--a not to subtle nod that the presidency does indeed belong to someone else).Some criticisms have focused on ""potshots"", the private scenes of Bush goofing for the camera before announcing that the war is on, Wolfowitz licking his comb to wet down his hair, Condi getting her face powdered, and Ashcroft singing horribly a song he wrote.  Yes, they are potshots, but the administration has brought it on themselves with their not too hidden disdain of the American people.  If people would read the history books, they'll see that this sort of ridiculing of the people in power isn't new.  During the reign of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, the people burned in effigy members of the government, put on adult rated puppet shows showing members of the Royal family in a negative light, and worse.  The relations between the people in power and the people who are governed rests on a mutual respect, and when an administration has shown its contempt for American values again and again, ridicule is sometimes the only way to get back at them.  Besides all that, I don't recall hearing much protest against some of the things conservatives joked about regarding Clinton and his administration.  That's the beauty of living in a free society...our leaders are not above ridicule if they invite it upon themselves.This film is a tad bit long and could have been cut some, especially the parts about the lone policeman patrolling Oregon's long border.  That's all interesting stuff that could have been a side feature mini-documentary on the DVD rather than be a part of the actual film.  I felt that it slowed the film down and sidetracked it just a little from the main focus of the film, which is the war in Iraq.What surprised me most about this film was how funny it was.  There haven't been much to laugh about since the 2000 elections and 9/11, but Moore brilliantly manages to find the humor in these strange times, mostly at the expense of the people hired to govern us, but also in the deceptive manner in which Marine recruiters go about looking for recruits.  I loved how the Marine asked someone his name and address to cross him off their list, while writing it down instead to send a brochure later.  I'm surprised that the Marines would allow themselves to be portrayed making false promises of wealth and fame to college bound teenagers.  That's one part of the documentary I'd like to see documentation on, because its simply too good to be true that Moore caught the Marines being deceptive like that on camera.This film ends on such a devastating blow to the Administration, using the words of Britney Spears and George W. Bush concerning trust and not getting fooled again.  I loved that Moore read some passages from Orwell's ""1984"", the most relevant novel of the times about how the government can switch enemies in the middle of a war and its citizens don't blink an eye, and how war is used more to control the populace at home than to bring about a serious victory in another country.  Yes, when it all boils down to it, why should we send our young and less economically affluent to die in overseas wars for rich men who avoided war when they had their chance to serve?  When are we going to wake up to the truth that we are the ones who will ultimately pay the cost in blood so that a few can get rich and gain evermore power.  This film is the wake up call of our generation.  Will we heed that call before too many more lives are ruined?",5,Doing what the corporate media failed to do,1097107200,"10 7, 2004",2004,5505,"['controversy', 'surrounding', 'film', 'point',

Compared to the fear-mongering, lying, deception, and soulless manipulation of religion that has gone on in the Bush administration, Moore's movie is kind of timid in its presentation.This movie affirms the old maxim that it is impossible to serve two masters. For all of his show in the other direction (playing up hot-button issues like abortion, stem cell research, faith-based &quot;initiatives&quot; etc.--all the while doing absolutely nothing about them by the way--***no doubt since he'd rather keep the issue alive to manipulate people with***) George Bush cares little for God or America, unless he can make a profit by them. And profit he has by the blood of America's bravest and by the blaspheming of all that is holy.Moore is timid because he only plays up the money aspect. He only soft-touches on how Bush and his cronies have used fear to make ostriches and slaves of the once free American people. He leaves Bush's religious hypocrisy largely untouched.Let me begin by noting that Bush has, on a couple of occasions suggested or outright said that Allah is the same God as the God of Jesus Christ. How evangelical Christians--which George Bush claims to be can overlook this is beyond me.But more to the point, how followers of Christ can support a man who has saturated the culture in fear can abide such a leader, and how Moore (also a Christian) did not see this as worthy of tying into his film baffles me. Our God (and even if you are not a Christian but still have a conscience--your &quot;god&quot; is a heck of a lot closer to my God than George Bush's demonic conception of a deity) does not give us a Spirit of fear, but of Sonship and Freedom. These are the very things that Bush and his Saudi/Al-queda allies hate.Wake up people. Moore's film is but the tip of the iceberg. We need only look at the fruits of George Bush, domestically and internationally to know what kind of smiling villain now illegally occupies the White House.Despite Moore's soft touch, I recommend this film very highly.",4,THE LOVE OF MONEY...,1089676800,"07 13, 2004",2004,2134,"['root', 'kinds', 'evil.Funny', 'hype', 'little', 'documentary', 'find', 'kind', 'tame', 'Compared', 'fear-mongering', 'lying', 'deception', 'soulless', 'manipulation', 'religion', 'gone', 'Bush', 'administration', 'Moore', 'movie', 'kind', 'timid', 'presentation.This', 'movie', 'old', 'maxim', 'impossible', 'serve', 'two', 'masters', 'show', 'other', 'direction', 'playing', 'up', 'hot-button', 'issues', 'abortion', 'stem', 'cell', 'research', 'faith-based', 'quot', 'quot', 'while', 'doing', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'way', '***no', 'doubt', ""'d"", 'rather', 'keep', 'issue', 'alive', 'manipulate', 'people', 'with***', 'George', 'Bush', 'little', 'God', 'America', 'can', 'make', 'profit', 'profit', 'blood', 'America', 'bravest', 'blaspheming', 'holy.Moore', 'timid', 'only', 'up', 'money', 'aspect', 'only', 'how', 'Bush', 'cronies', 'have', 'used', 'fear', 'make', 'ostriches', 'slaves', 'once', 'free', 'American', 'people', 'Bush', 'religious', 'hypocrisy', 'largely', 'untouched.Let', 'begin', 'noting', 'Bush', 'couple', 'occasions', 'suggested', 'outright', 'said', 'Allah', 'same', 'God', 'God', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'How', 'evangelical', 'Christians', 'George', 'Bush', 'be', 'can', 'overlook', 'me.But', 'more', 'point', 'how', 'followers', 'Christ', 'can', 'support', 'man', 'who', 'saturated', 'culture', 'fear', 'can', 'abide', 'such', 'leader', 'how', 'Moore', 'also', 'Christian', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'worthy', 'tying', 'film', 'baffles', 'God', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'Christian', 'still', 'have', 'conscience', 'quot', 'quot', 'heck', 'lot', 'closer', 'God', 'George', 'Bush', 'demonic', 'conception', 'deity', 'not', 'give', 'Spirit', 'fear', 'Sonship', 'Freedom', 'are', 'very', 'things', 'Bush', 'Saudi/Al-queda', 'allies', 'hate.Wake', 'up', 'people', 'Moore', 'film', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'need', 'only', 'look', 'fruits', 'George', 'Bush', 'domestically', 'internationally', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'smiling', 'villain', 'now', 'illegally', 'White', 'House.Despite', 'Moore', 'soft', 'touch', 'recommend', 'film', 'very', 'highly']",Fahrenheit 9/11

Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[10, 20]","By now Michael Moore is a true love-him-or-hate-him guy, another face that can ignite rage in some people and smug smiles in others.I liked Roger & Me, back in 1988 when he could get away with making that film and not get noticed by too many people.  I thought Bowling for Columbine was interesting--at least someone was trying to make a film you could think about, bias or no bias.  There've been shouting matches over whether or not this film is a 'documentary', which should tell you something.  Some dismiss it as 'propaganda', others think it's the 'Truth'.My problem with this movie is not the anti-Bush stance, or the questions asked, it's the fact that I can't figure out what the film is about.  This film has no thesis, it hardly has a point to make.  It seems like a long rant about the last four years, starting of course, with more moaning about the 2000 election, suggesting that life would be just rosy if we'd elected the other candidate of the big business party.Give me a break.  As a documentary, the film is not very good.  As a Moore heart-tugger and audience-reaction-getter, it can be effective.  I don't think you'll learn anything from this movie.  It will either reinforce your views, or give you a fit.  What are you supposed to do with this movie?  Picket the White House?  Moore has all of the resources and by now the money to make a good documentary, but instead he wastes our time with a movie designed to get people NOT to vote for Bush, so you can see how much documentary integrity he cares about.I like some of Moore's work, including his TV show The Awful Truth, which pointed a funny bone at some issues (the guy dressed as Hitler going to Swiss banks, or 'Corporate COPS'.)  Yes, Bush is a mistake, the war is wrong, but Moore is not the answer.

More political satire than documentary, Moore show Bush and Co with their pants at their ankles, and were it not for the fact that this dunce is supposed to be the leader of the free world, the film would stand up exceptionally well with any of Mel Brooks' great films of the seventies. Sadly, most of what is in the film actually happened, and though Moore jumps to conclusions on lots of stuff, in all honesty, his subject is such a complete dullard, I'm sure W'd go to the film and carp about the actor who played the President.There's plenty to be concerned about here, yet Moore steers clear of indicting the Christian Fundamentalist Fascists who also have a large stake in seeing W re-elected. Ashcroft, a modern day Goebbels, Rumsfeld (did someone say Goerring) and Cheney (Herr Himmler, so good to see you again) play W like a fiddle and it shows clearly throughout this film. This is almost a scratch and sniff film, the odious nature of which comes through in the aforementioned quartet's reckless disregard for the truth all the way through to the moronic US servicemen extolling the virtues of some Dokken tune they listen to before they go out to kill. And to think we all thought Kubrik was stretching it a bit with Slim Pickens... (for the infantile ME and X generations out there, it's a reference to a film about nuclear war - ask your parents).Among the questions running through my mind while I was watching this was how in the heck did Moore get his hands on the footage here. And why weren't Bush's handlers turning cameras off before W embarrassed himself and the Office. I was hankering for some trash talk from Potty-Mouth Cheney, but you just get him grousing about Halliburton allegations. You know he wants to wave the digit at someone but felt too repressed at the time.It remains to be seen if the American public has the guts to vote for integrity. There is nothing in the history of the US since Reagan to suggest that the electorate will evaluate the candidates based on reality instead of ideology. More's the pity. The US has dug itself into several holes that it desperately needs to get out of, especially regarding its deficit, its moral standing and its ability to set a role model for democracy throughout the world. All empires collapse at some point. W is very much a Nero for the Twenty-First Century. Problem is that he doesn't just take the Roman Empire down with him as he fiddles about. Those of us north of the 49th parallel have grave concerns. We're way too close to that sucking sound of things going down the tubes.We're all watching you people. Laugh at this film.

Forget the slapstick humor, South Park'ish cartoon interludes or much of Moore, because here Mike just lets the neo-conservatives, right wing media, senators and the odd President of the United States of America make fun of themselves without them even having to try that hard. However the moment that a dead Iraqi baby is held up to the screen is the moment that you realize that Moore is no longer concerned with giving us that many giggles and also that this documentary is going to cause significant problems for Bush's reelection campaign.We are hit with a barrage of appalling film reels, excluded by the mainstream US news, that impressed the judges at Cannes, because 99% of F911 is all about what you WHERE NOT ALLOWED TO SEE. F911 will give you a news update of 4 years from 2001 to 2004 that has been missing from your lives, simply because the material is considered anti-American or unpatriotic to show on national television (but Iraqis have seen plenty of it on their own!)... and ALL of it packs a whopping punch to boot.It is clear from watching the first few minutes of F911 that Mike has one goal in mind - to identify Bush as a problem that needs to be gotten rid off, so Moore devotes massive screen time over to his favorite Texas tongue twister and lets him get rid of himself by simply playing back for us some things that this guy has been jabbering on about over the years.......... BRING IT ON! Those where the 3 words that sent the Iraqi people ape, burning convoys, hanging US civilian bodies from bridges, kidnapping journalists and decapitating foreign workers on video camera. If it is not clear that Bush is an incredibly very stupid leader then WHO OR WHAT IS?After a smashing opening sequence where Bush's cabinet are all seen putting on makeup before they go on camera - showing us that these people are JUST ACTORS!, we learn that Bush had businesses funded by the Bin Ladens and was very intimate with the Saudi Royals. In fact the name he himself blacked out from his army records was none other than his business partner who made the Saudi/Bin Laden deals for him! It is blatantly obvious that a rich Saudi oil businessman is really not interested in financing a small time US oil player, but is interested in the President's son. What Moore points out is that there can be no doubt that this partnership has turned into a very bitter rivalry... with the REST OF MANKIND STUCK INBETWEEN AND GETTING THE FULL BRUNT OF WHAT IS THEIR FINANICAL/BUSINESS PROBLEM! In fact Moore even shows us how the Bush family continued their relationship with the terrorists AFTER 911!F911 is not a conspiracy theory. It is not about how much Bush knew about 911 or even if he was responsible for it. It is not about possible CIA operations to crash planes around America, nor are any conspiracies even touched on. In fact Moore just paints the President as a man who just likes to party with the rich, doing what the rich want him to do, helping them to get richer. On 911 his priority was with his rich friends. He allowed members of the rich Bin Laden family to leave America, because the rich Saudi ambassador asked him. As Moore so aptly points out... would Clinton have let the parents and friends of Timothy McVeigh take a flight out of the country, all together, without at least getting them on the record?The actual events of 911 are treated with dignity by Moore. Instead of replaying everything we have seen a hundred times before, Moore just lets the screen go black and plays us a sound recording from within the Trade Centre at the time of the attack... a deeply unsettling experience. Then we are quickly thrown into Iraq, bypassing Afghanistan as nothing more than an excuse to build another oil pipeline, and we are after Saddam while OBL remains at large. We then get to see troops on the ground playing heavy metal music on their headsets while machine gunning everything in sight, bagging Iraqis over their heads, raiding their homes looking for dissidents and generally showing people what it is like back home!... and we get plenty of that when Mike starts his rant about The Patriot Act.The real cream of F911 however is how the army recruits young marines, by showing up at malls in disadvantaged areas, and with a laser like ability, home in on a poor kid and manage to convince the teen to join up. It is frightening how pro these hunters are (one hunter even hints to an underage teen that he LOOKS much older!). Mike then sets out to Capital Hill to see if he can recruit a Senator's son or daughter for the marines... and obviously fails because no one with any sense would send their kids to that war... but Mike introduces us to a family that does think it makes sense, only when their son is KIA, it all changes very quickly. Near the White House the mother meets an old lady advertising the horrors of war, only to be confronted by protesters who say she is a fake. The confrontation lasts a few seconds with the mother of the marine who was KIA, but the denial on the part of the pro-war protester to acknowledge the mother's dead son at first, and then trying to justify it, shows how terribly ill some people really are.F911 is so full of information it can not be reviewed in 1000 words, however it is safe to say that this is the most important documentary

It's almost like getting a whole other documentary (FAHRENHEIT, PART TWO) for the price of one. The special features include amazing footage of Iraqis pleading to see their captive loved-ones outside of Abu Ghraib prison, as well as footage of just-released prisoners describing what they endured inside. (Moore had this footage before the Abu Ghraib scandal broke, and it's mind-altering to see this footage knowing what we know now about what was happening inside.) The dvd also includes more amazing, first-hand, up-close footage of the Iraq war, including footage of the U.S. military busting into homes and rounding up and arresting the wrong ""suspects."" Moreover, this dvd includes extensive footage of Condolezza Rice perjuring herself before the 9/11 Commission, where, among other lies, she claimed that the PDB (""Bin Laden Determined to Strike in US"") given to Bush before 9/11 was merely ""historical"" in nature. (The 9/11 Commission discovered that her statement was false by interviewing the CIA analysts who actually wrote and prepared the PDB for Bush. The analysts testified that, far from being historical [as Rice had claimed], the August 6 PDB was ""both current and serious"" in nature. See the 9/11 COMMISSION REPORT, page 260, for their discovery, as well as for the text of the whole PDB.) The FAHRENHEIT 9/11 dvd also includes a press conference that a nervous-looking Bush gave just after meeting behind closed doors with the 9/11 Commission. For some much-needed catharsis, there's a very funny sequence of Arab-American comedians performing stand-up in New York City after 9/11, expressing in comedy what life was like for them after the attack. There's even footage of Moore winning his award at Cannes, and also of the Washington, D.C., premier of the movie.

630152,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B00005JNEI,Patrick L. Randall,"[35, 50]","Michael Moore is an important individual; one who provides and invaluable service to this nation.  He reminds each and everyone of us the importance exercising the rights granted us by the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights, especially during a time when we live with a presidential administration that seems more focused on denying us those rights than dealing with its stated purpose of protecting us from terrorists.  Michael Moore, despite his unkempt appearance, and reputation as nothing more than a leftist rabble-rouser, continues to demonstrate the importance of agitation.  His constant questioning, and some would say harassing, of long-standing institutions and organizations, throws open for debate topics that people may be afraid or unwilling to discuss.  Some view agitation (erroneously) as unpatriotic, and peg individuals who engage in as Un-American.  Yet, agitation is at the very foundation of American principles and is what insures that our rights continue to be protected.  Agitation is what enabled and motley band of outraged colonist to rise up and unite thirteen disparate entities to throw off the oppression of British rule.  Agitation was the method famed abolitionist Frederick Douglas espoused when fighting against slavery.  Agitation enraged the American public against injustices and incited them to force change.  Now, Michael Moore uses agitation to inflame the public to lies, fraud, and general incompetence of an executive administration that claims to only have our best interests at heart.  Michael Moore's chosen vehicle for this is his controversial, inflammatory, and undeniably powerful documentary, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"".What happened that allowed the terrible tragedy of 9/11 to happen?  Are we winning the war on terror that was declared in its aftermath?  Why did Iraqi President Saddam Hussein order those planes to be flown in the World Trade Center and the Pentagon?...  huh?  Let's back up a second.  It wasn't Saddam Hussein that ordered it. It was Osama Bin Laden ordering his terrorist organization, Al Qaeda, to execute those attacks.  So, why are we invading Iraq?  Well, that's a fascinating question and is as the very core of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"".  It seems that the `reign of error' (and now `terror') of the George W. Bush administration has been insisting on this connection for more than two years.""Fahrenheit 9/11"" opens with that seminal period back in November 2000, when the presidential election was thrown into chaos by those dastardly hanging `chads' (and several thousand disenfranchised voters) in Florida.  Moore sets up the events leading to that terrible September day with his characteristic biting wit and with surprising tension.  He shows clip after clip of Bush administration members indicating that they saw no connection between Iraq and Al Qaeda, yet they insisted the connection was incontrovertible after 9/11.  He shows evidence that Bush Administration considered Bin Laden's threat such low priority that they didn't even hold the first all-hands meeting on potential terrorist threats until a week before the attack.  He chronicles a series of events leading up to 9/11, including Dubya's month long August vacation as events were coming a head, and his early September visit to Florida to visit his brother, Governor Jeb Bush, on Sept. 10th, 2001.  Then, the screen goes black, and Moore lets horrifying sounds of 9/11 tell the story of that day as vividly and powerful as any video.What is most damning about ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is how effectively Moore presents the case of how bungled and mishandled the `War on Terror' following 9/11 in favor of promoting their own personal agendas.  Much like in his book ""Dude? Where's my Country?"" a companion piece to this film, Moore highlights the less than kosher connection between Bush and Saudi royal family (15 of the hijackers were Saudi) and to the Bin Laden family themselves.  Then Moore goes on the assault to bring to light the dirty little secret that our government is doing very little to rid the world of Al Qaeda with less than one full division of soldiers being committed to attack in Afghanistan, while most of our resources are being dedicated to an Iraq war that is fast becoming the second edition of Vietnam.  The reasons Moore illuminates for this are thought provoking and scary.Even more depressing than the lack of progress in the War on Terror is the legislation that is being rammed through to Congress to `protect' us.  The inappropriately title ""Patriot Act"" is the worst restriction of rights since the Alien and Sedition Acts, yet it got passed because of on sadly telling reason, as representative John Conyers conveyed to Michael Moore in the most fatherly of ways; ""Congress doesn't read most of what it passes.""  Now that is scary.The most heart-wrenching portion of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is the ongoing sub-story of a mother whose son is serving in the Army and is stationed in Iraq.  Moore chronicles the progression of this woman's pride in her son's duty and belief in his mission to her abject grief and fierce opposition to his mission following his tragic death in combat in Baghdad (several months after Bush declared the war over and `Mission Accomplished').It is so tempting to sit here and review every single point put forth by this incredibly important film.  Doing so would far exceed the word limit on reviews, and would do poor justice to the ultimate power of this documentary.  ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is Michael Moore's most accomplished and polished work to date.  So, it should come as no surprise that it is also his most powerful.  Moore gives a voice the American people would otherwise not hear and desperately need to.",5,Moore pulls the curtain back on the real Wizard of Oz,1088985600,"07 5, 2004",2004,5717,"['Michael',

He distorted and fabricated the facts, he lied, he twisted the truths all in the self-serving name of making money to help line his pockets with money and help pay for his 2.5 million dollar condo. This guy is a sham. The fact that the public believes him as if he is some kind of truth-telling god is a sin of the worst kind.

I am not a flag-waving gun, toting patriot, nor am I a Moore-esque radical leftist.  I, if anything sit slightly on the liberal side of political neutrality.  That being said, there are a few things to know.  First and without exception, when watching any Michael Moore Movie, you need to know a few things.  Moore generally knows what he is talking about, but tends to show only one side of the issue in question.  Second, he likes to exaggerate the truth.  He doesn't outright lie, but he doesn't give it to you straight.  Not by a long shot.  You need to kick everything that comes out of his mouth down a couple of notches, to make up for his inflation of the issue.  This goes for every film he has ever done.  Let's face it.  Very few people have the same views on our country, G.W. Bush, Iraq, Foreign Policy, or our Armed Forces as Moore does.  Moore is an extremist, and comes off a bit too opinionated and radical for some Americans to handle in one sitting.  If you keep an open mind and do your homework on the issues at hand though, Farhrenheit 9/11 provides an interesting look at our advances overseas in the past few years, and our practices here in our own country.  Moore tells you not to believe all that you see on TV, and he is right.  The same statement goes for him, as well, though. If you watch this film and and think either ""Oh, I love George W, so that movie sucked,"" or ""Oh I hate Bush and that was awesome"", you are doing yourself an injustice.  Open-mindedness and reason need to be implemented when you watch this film for yourself.The Final Word - I recommend that you see this film only if you are smart enough to handle it.  Leave your own political views at the door and take it for what it is, a movie made by a man who sees problems around him and wants to see something done about it.

The class fumbled along, attempting to please him with their answers.  ""When you're able to repeat it."" one said.  ""When you can use it to understand other concepts,"" was another response.  I want to address the fundamental controversy behind Fahrenheit 9/11 using this very question I was asked back in college.  The fundamental controversy behind this film, is that it portrays our government as motivated by the potential to make huge profits at the expense of innocent lives.  The innuendo boldly set forth by Michael Moore is that we invaded Iraq to gain strategic control of the Mid-East oil supply. Moore outlines this point very well: he shows Hamid Karzai, a Bush connection from his oil company days being appointed leader of Afghanistan, and shows how shortly thereafter a pipeline began to be built in that country.  These are facts. If you watch the special features to this DVD, (and I hope you did) than you saw the lengthy interview with former Marine Abdul Henderson, who told Michael Moore that their first duty in Iraq was to secure the oil supply, and then go about ""liberating"" the country.Why is it hard for the film's detractors to accept that our government is greedy and disingenuous? We all know we were told this war was to find WMDs, but it only takes a little research to see what the bigger picture is.So I return to my original point.  How do you know something? How do we as Americans know the government invaded Iraq for control of the second largest oil supply in the world? For some people, they would only know it if President Bush admitted it in a state of the union address.It's time to be active Americans.  We can't rely on the spin that we get from the White House.  Fahrenheit 9/11 is a good first step for a lot of people to wake up to what's going on.  If documentaries are your thing, there's a whole slew of them that deal with these kinds of issues coming out.

This is the same man that tells his readers that it is impossible to become a millionaire in this country, all while he reaps the enormous profits of his best-selling books and films. In this particular film, he tells us that black people are 'forced' to live in ghettos and would have us believe that Iraq was a happy, peaceful place before the evil Americans came. He misuses grieving mothers to suit his own ends and deceitfully uses Marine recruiters(one who has since given his life in Iraq) to portray them as heartless predators. Mr. Moore is unscrupulous to say the least. As most people know, there are several ""right-wing"" rebuttals to this film, most notably, 'Farenhype 9/11' and 'Celsius 41.11.' It completely baffles me how certain reviewers can praise this film, and then turn around and dismiss these rebuttals as nothing but extreme right propaganda.

Despite the immense effort of Pentagon PR firms (like the Rendon Group) to trash this film, there are simply too many powerful insights for it to be ignored (hence, all the rageful reviews from those who have been ""Hannitized"" or otherwise intellectually handicapped).  These insights anger war profiteers and moral cowards, but many free-thinking Americans can handle the truth.  For instance, the truth shared by George Bush in the film when, at a fat-cat fundraising gala, he tells the audience, ""Some people consider you to be the elite, I consider you to be my base.""  A rare moment of honesty from the figure-head of corporate power, the chief gopher of Big Business.To read the opinions that dozens of US military members and their families have of Moore and his work, check out ""Will They Ever Trust Us Again,"" a compilation of letters Moore has received from US troops.  I'm sure he could've also done a book of hate mail he has received, but those comments are so predictable and boring there wouldn't be much of a point to publishing the thoughts of self-righteous lemmings.Much more interesting would be the thoughts of Iraqis on this film.  I'm sure they appreciate the efforts of US citizens to question an illegal invasion that has killed over 100,000 innocent people.My only criticism of this DVD is that there is no option for Spanish subtitles.  Spanish speakers, including undocumented immigrants, are a growing part of our imperial forces.  They need access to the perspectives Moore provides in this important film.Lastly, Moore is also featured in the award winning documentary, ""The Corporation,"" another DVD that helps to free our minds from establishment indoctrination.",5,A favorite among US troops,1146614400,"05 3, 2006",2006,1991,"['copies', 'Farenheit', '9/11', 'are', 'available', 'inexpensively', ""'ve"", 'been', 'buying', 'extra', 'copies', 'giving', 'out', 'co-workers', 'second-hand', 'stores', 'US', 'troops', 'serving', 'overseas', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'thankful', 'people', 'military', 'have', 'been', 'receive', 'copy', 'film', 'immense', 'effort', 'Pentagon', 'PR', 'firms', 'Rendon', 'Group', 'trash', 'film', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'many', 'powerful', 'insights', 'be', 'ignored', 'hence', 'rageful', 'reviews', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'Hannitized', 'otherwise', 'intellectually', 'handicapped', 'insights', 'anger', 'war', 'profiteers', 'moral', 'cowards', 'many', 'free-thinking', 'Americans', 'can', 'handle', 'truth', 'instance', 'truth', 'shared', 'George', 'Bush', 'film', 'when', 'fat-cat', 'fundraising', 'gala', 'audience', 'people', 'consider', 'be', 'elite', 'consider', 'be', 'base', 'rare', 'moment', 'honesty', 'figure-head', 'corporate', 'power', 'chief', 'gopher', 'Big', 'Business.To', 'read', 'opinions', 'dozens', 'US', 'military', 'members', 'families', 'have', 'Moore', 'work', 'check', 'Will', 'Ever', 'Trust', 'Us', 'Again', 'compilation', 'letters', 'Moore', 'received', 'US', 'troops', ""'m"", 'sure', 'could', ""'ve"", 'also', 'done', 'book', 'hate', 'mail', 'received', 'comments', 'are', 'so', 'predictable', 'boring', 'there', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'point', 'publishing', 'thoughts', 'self-righteous', 'lemmings.Much', 'more', 'interesting', 'would', 'be', 'thoughts', 'Iraqis', 'film', ""'m"", 'sure', 'appreciate', 'efforts', 'US', 'citizens', 'question', 'illegal', 'invasion', 'killed', '100,000', 'innocent', 'people.My', 'only', 'criticism', 'DVD', 'option', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'Spanish', 'speakers', 'including', 'undocumented', 'immigrants', 'are', 'growing', 'part', 'imperial', 'forces', 'need', 'access', 'perspectives', 'Moore', 'important', 'film.Lastly', 'Moore', 'also', 'featured', 'award', 'winning', 'documentary', 'Corporation', 'DVD', 'free', 'minds', 'establishment', 'indoctrination']",Fahrenheit 9/11

630166,A2VN986E5KR1NV,B00005JNEI,ProperGander News (Dr. Emil Shuffhausen),"[13, 62]","There's no way to review this alleged ""documentary"" without getting into a political battle.  Of course, confrontation is the goal of Michael Moore, a provacateur without peer, who has acheived new heights--or depths, depending on your point of view--in manipulative propaganda. I saw it and was impressed at Moore's wily skills and at his grasp on the gullibility of certain sectors of the American public. Moore has craftily cobbled together a very compelling screed against George W. Bush with the explicitly stated goal of removing Bush from office by any means.  But the greatest victim of Moore's filmmaking, not only in this film but his earlier efforts as well, are not Moore's targets, but it is truth itself.  Even Liberal icons such as Chris Matthews have noted that many of Moore's specific accusations are ludicrous and without merit. With that in mind, can I call this a great film, even though it is definitely skillfully made?  Moore has, after all, marketed it--not as fiction, but as a factual documentary.  It strikes me that the best example I can cite in terms of comparison for this film is ""Triumph of the Will,"" a documentary about the sixth Nazi Party Congress of 1934 directed by Leni Riefenstahl. That film is widely lauded for its technical and directorial skill and its carefully aimed imagery. ""Triumph of the Will"" is, in Susan Sontag's words, ""the most successfully, most purely propagandistic film ever made.""  Well, ""Triumph of the Will"" may be technically a brilliant acheivement in filmmaking, but it's goals and results were evil, and there's no way, if I were reviewing it for Amazon, that I would not give it the lowest possible rating.  Therefore, Michael Moore, despite his obvious skills as a filmmaker, his faux folksiness, his charming, scruffy ""everyman"" act, and his passionate ""beliefs,"" also deserves nothing but scorn and derision.

In fact, about an hour in, I knew the old pitch sold by the Dems pretty well from the popular press, and was fixing to walk out, go home and do some laundry.  I didn't care much for the attempts at conversion of so much archival video to the more robust 35mm format, either.  But I did like the intimate coverage of George W. Bush, ""The Man"", and I must thank Mr. Moore for producing such a fine portrait of this most remarkable American.  In his older days, he bore a striking resemblance to James Caan--or so I thought.  I didn't care for all the attempts to pull on what are left of my heart's strings with all the anecdoctal tales of individual woe, for indeed, the world is pretty woeful in a lot of ways, and the Bush machine must have hardened me to all of that, years ago.  If this is all a big racket driven by oil and the Saudis, well, it looks like the train to be on; count me in.  Bush has become much better known to me as a result of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", and this is the film's greatest contribution to the campaign.  What else was there...hmm...Albert Gore and the sore losers.  And of course, there's candidate K., about whom we know even less.  Want to win--well, let's let George do it.  The choir will sing louder from all this preaching, but some do not come for the music.

I cried non-stop, admittedly the only one.He, Moore, was BRILLIANT with the way he did 9/11. NO towers, no planes, what a relief. But even sadder.I do not agree with those formal reviewers who praise him for staying out of much of the film. He's not like Woody Allen, except which do you prefer: When Woody is IN a film or not. Right, IN. Same for me with Michael Moore, who manages to be essentially sweet if also salty and funny.The potshots re: his not being levelheaded and giving two sides is a total joke. He got part of the jig saw puzzle we will never fully get. MOST interesting is all the help he got with facts and footage from I'm guessing--least likely sources. Amazing range of non public material, often not shot, never, by Moore.To those who think he's a wacko, I say, He's OUR WACKO and from Flint, to rise to this level of imagination (NOT LIES) is so brilliant. Especially Michael wondering whatever is BUSH thinking in that school room with the goat book, is a highlight. But then too:there are many. I could watch this four or five more times. Also, I think when the DVD comes out we should buy it to send to those undecided voters. BUT last, I'll say, this did NOT leave me crazy for Kerry, tho I'll vote for him.

Dr. Marvin SHouser sums things up well with this hypothetical: suppose there is a forest fire in progress and a conservative and a liberal are sent in to put it out, and given complete discretion in how to do so. the liberal will likely fill a teacup up with water, then run to the fire and throw it on. obviously this will do nothing. the conservative, on the other hand, will build a fire break and sacrifice the portion of the forest already engulfed to save the rest. however, the cameras will film 2 things: the liberal throwing the teacup of water on the fire and the fire going out. the liberal will then claim that what he did put out the fire, even though it did nothing. he will even go so far as to accuse the conservative of doing nothing to help. some even go so far the delude THEMSELVES into believing what they did worked! it the world of the liberal, appearance is all that matters, and if you dig down past the top layer, you get slammed with PC nonsense. this film in comparison to celsius 41.11 is THE prime example of this. Celsius was criticized for being too right wing and not entertaining enough. the first words in celsius is ""we begin with the premise that john kerry is an honroable man"" and all the speakers maintain a professional repsect for the opposition. the closest anyone comes to breaking that is Medved, who says in regard to bush's statement that we need to fight terrorism by doing something other than turning the other cheek by saying, ""Bush understands this. THe other side does not"". but even that maintains a professional respect. Celsius is a REAL documentary-created to inform, not entertain. it gives a factual breakdown of current political issues and the 00 and 04 elections. farenheit, on the other hand, features a bunch of clips that moore twisted completely out of context, and mixed in is rhetorical nonsense from moore himself. There is not ONE solid fact in this film. there's just a lot circumstantial stuff that even most liberals would dismiss if moore showed the whole picture. we've actually fallen so far as a country and become so pathetic that we ignore real facts and instead believe a guy driving around DC in a golf cart reading the patriot act over a megaphone. no wonder people were avoiding him-they thought he was retarded! but hey, it's PC, so people will actually believe this. open your eyes to moore's films and other liberal arguments and propaganda. there's no logic or facts to any of it, just a bunch of PC hyperbole that we've been turning into law and social policy for the last 80 years or so.",1,Typical liberal trash,1150761600,"06 20, 2006",2006,2686,"['film', 'what', 'liberals', 'are', 'fanatic', 'placing', 'importance', 'appearance', 'rather', 'substance', 'Dr.', 'Marvin', 'SHouser', 'sums', 'things', 'up', 'well', 'hypothetical', 'suppose', 'forest', 'fire', 'progress', 'conservative', 'liberal', 'are', 'sent', 'put', 'out', 'given', 'complete', 'discretion', 'how', 'do', 'so', 'liberal', 'will', 'likely', 'fill', 'teacup', 'up', 'water', 'then', 'run', 'fire', 'throw', 'obviously', 'will', 'do', 'nothing', 'conservative', 'other', 'hand', 'will', 'build', 'fire', 'break', 'sacrifice', 'portion', 'forest', 'already', 'engulfed', 'save', 'rest', 'however', 'cameras', 'will', 'film', '2', 'things', 'liberal', 'throwing', 'teacup', 'water', 'fire', 'fire', 'going', 'out', 'liberal', 'will', 'then', 'claim', 'what', 'did', 'put', 'out', 'fire', 'even', 'did', 'nothing', 'will', 'even', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'accuse', 'conservative', 'doing', 'nothing', 'help', 'even', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'delude', 'THEMSELVES', 'believing', 'what', 'did', 'worked', 'world', 'liberal', 'appearance', 'matters', 'dig', 'down', 'top', 'layer', 'get', 'slammed', 'PC', 'nonsense', 'film', 'comparison', 'celsius', '41.11', 'THE', 'prime', 'example', 'Celsius', 'was', 'criticized', 'being', 'too', 'right', 'wing', 'not', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'first', 'words', 'celsius', 'begin', 'premise', 'john', 'kerry', 'honroable', 'man', 'speakers', 'maintain', 'professional', 'repsect', 'opposition', 'closest', 'anyone', 'breaking', 'Medved', 'who', 'regard', 'bush', 'statement', 'need', 'fight', 'terrorism', 'doing', 'something', 'other', 'turning', 'other', 'cheek', 'saying', 'Bush', 'THe', 'other', 'side', 'not', 'even', 'professional', 'respect', 'Celsius', 'REAL', 'documentary-created', 'inform', 'not', 'entertain', 'factual', 'breakdown', 'current', 'political', 'issues', '00', '04', 'elections', 'farenheit', 'other', 'hand', 'bunch', 'clips', 'moore', 'twisted', 'completely', 'context', 'mixed', 'rhetorical', 'nonsense', 'moore', 'not', 'ONE', 'solid', 'fact', 'film', 'just', 'lot', 'circumstantial', 'stuff', 'even', 'most', 'liberals', 'would', 'dismiss', 'moore', 'showed', 'whole', 'picture', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'fallen', 'so', 'far', 'country', 'become', 'so', 'pathetic', 'ignore', 'real', 'facts', 'instead', 'believe', 'guy', 'driving', 'around', 'DC', 'golf', 'cart', 'reading', 'patriot', 'act', 'megaphone', 'wonder', 'people', 'were', 'avoiding', 'him-they', 'thought', 'was', 'retarded', 'PC', 'so', 'people', 'will', 'actually', 'believe', 'open', 'eyes', 'moore', 'films', 'other', 'liberal', 'arguments', 'propaganda', 'logic', 'facts', 'just', 'bunch', 'PC', 'hyperbole', ""'ve"", 'been', 'turning', 'law', 'social', 'policy', 'last', '80', 'years', 'so']",Fahrenheit 9/11

You would expect that a4:00 PM Monday afternoon showing would be just about empty orsparsely populated.  It was fortunate that I arrived early enoughto get a good seat since by the time the showing started, thetheatre was packed.  It was mostly adults and some families withyoung kids.I can tell you that this is a  P O W E R F U L  documentary.  Itfar exceeds anything that Michael Moore has done in the past.  Bythe time it ended two hours later, there was thunderous applausefrom a theatre full of people who could not tear themselves awayfrom the screen during the entire showing.  Even though it wastwo hours long, it seemed quite short since the images captivatedthe viewers with scene after scene of compelling information, andsometimes, outright shock.  But Moore went even further with anuncanny ability to produce comedy amid tragedy.  One did not wantto miss even a second of what was showing.Moore has proved himself to be a genius in production andediting!  Some of his special effects gave a dimension rarelyseen in a movie.  During the actual attack on the twin towers,the screen goes black with no image at all, but what you hear arethe actual sound recordings of the planes crashing into thebuilding and the the horrified sounds of the people.  The effectwas awesome!  It took an image that Americans have seen hundredsof times before and turned it into something totally new and withpowerful results!  Even when the image finally returns, he nevershows the twin towers.  Instead he shows the people.  The effectwas truly awesome.You will be genuinely shocked by some of the information heprovides about George Bush and his Texas business ventures.  Doyou have any idea at all who was bankrolling GW Bush's businessfailures?  Take a guess.  I won't tell you, but you may beshell-shocked when you find out.  Not only that, but GHW Bush isinvolved as well.  Guess who provided the Bush family and friendswith 1.4 BILLION DOLLARS!?From the audience participation, you would think you were seeingthe latest Hollywood blockbuster thriller.  There was not apassive soul in sight.  The audience shrieked, they cried, theylaughed, they howled!  And when it was finally over, they showedtheir approval with a thunderous applause that I have rarely everseen at a theatre anywhere.There was no quiet stream of people passively leaving thistheatre.  The sound of people talking, communicating was almostdeafening.  They were roused.  They were energized. And this isone movie whose word-of-mouth will spread far and wide.

If this film is true (of course it's also part of the fault that Clinton didn't do anything either)I have much discust for Bush.  To see our soldiers fighting and dying while Bush is entertaining was a deplorable act.  I was also amazed by how many of our US Milatary also don't like him and why none of this wasn't covered or shown on network TV.  It seems like both our media and political leaders are in bed together in this love/hate relationship.  Personally i do not vote anymore because no matter who you elect they are all crooks.  Things you see on TV never seem to be what really is happening in this world.  Which brings to me my next statement of Television.  I have pretty much STOPPED watching news programs because of lies from the media and our political leaders which is also why i don't vote.  I have also changed my religion which states in the Bible that we shouldn't get politically involved anyway. Our main stream church has their political agenda also which should not be.I'm glad i saw this film and i hope more people will see this.

In Farenheit 911 Moore is doing a lot of asking and a lot of conservatives are doing a lot of dodging,i.e.especially when Moore tries to get Congressmen to explain why none of their kids are in Iraq fighting the ""good fight""Moore, as a documentary film-maker is ruthless and that's why he is effective.Nowhere else will you see footage of a perplexed George Bush sitting in a schoolhouse chair on the morning of 911, seemingly frozen after getting word that something big was shaking out there.Painful to watch, but necessary.It used to be the presses job to give us the facts but these days there seems to be a gag order on members of the media, especially when it concerns this administration and the war in Iraq. You don't want your wife outed for being in the CIA, do you?Moore made no secret of the fact that he was trying to influence the outcome of the  2004 presidential election by putting this film out when he did...and it almost worked. But in the end Carl Rove and the other masterminds who work for Bush managed to prevail through smear and slander. They managed to trash Moore and his film and sent the swift-boat vets to take care of John Kerry.Republicans everywhere condemned Moores'film as a pack of lies but they had no real way of explaining away the facts presented in it.Limbaugh condemned the film but admitted to his listeners that he's never seen it himself...instead he took the advise of people who told him it was a ""cut & paste job"". Strange coming from a guy who often complains that people critisize his show without ever having heard it. But let's get back to Moore...""911"" is a must for people who want to try and make sense of what happened in Washington and around the country after...and in some cases before...September 11, 2001. It becomes apparent that the Bush administration was not focused on the terrorist threat before that tragic day and after it was history they tried to take advantage of it in the form of convincing Americans that the country of Iraq and it's leader, Saddam Hussein, were an ""imminent threat"" that needed to be dealt with immediately. But ""911"" is also about much more than that. It is about corruption in all of politics and how that effects those of us in this country who still believe that America is a great place and freedom is a great blessing. The caveat in this movie is that our freedoms are under assault, not from without bit from within(,e.g the Patriot Act, illegal immigration, the silencing of the media)and the only way that we can protect that freedom is by dealing with the cold, hard facts.So we can harp on the fact that Michael Moore is an overweight guy who dresses like a slob or we can attest to the fact that he makes one hell of a documentary and forces us to think.",5,The Heat Is On the Neo-Cons,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,3444,"['Rush', 'Limbaugh', 'fond', 'saying', 'liberals', 'hate', 'light', 'truth', 'them.Apparently', 'why', 'conservatives', 'think', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'worth', 'thing', 'ever', 'happened', 'them.After', 'previous', 'film', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'right', 'wingers', 'were', 'up', 'arms', 'especially', 'Moore', 'confronted', 'NRA', 'spokesmen', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'own', 'home', 'asked', 'why', 'orginization', 'always', 'held', 'rallies', 'right', 'gun', 'tragedy', 'happened', 'rally', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'city', 'tragedy.It', 'was', 'powerful', 'stuff', 'watch', 'not', 'wanted', 'see', 'Heston', 'shrink', 'stumble', 'words', 'instead', 'certain', 'questions', 'need', 'be', 'answered', 'Farenheit', '911', 'Moore', 'doing', 'lot', 'asking', 'lot', 'conservatives', 'are', 'doing', 'lot', 'dodging', 'i.e.especially', 'when', 'Moore', 'get', 'Congressmen', 'explain', 'why', 'none', 'kids', 'are', 'Iraq', 'fighting', 'good', 'fight', 'Moore', 'documentary', 'film-maker', 'ruthless', 'why', 'effective.Nowhere', 'else', 'will', 'see', 'footage', 'perplexed', 'George', 'Bush', 'sitting', 'schoolhouse', 'chair', 'morning', '911', 'seemingly', 'frozen', 'getting', 'word', 'something', 'big', 'was', 'shaking', 'out', 'there.Painful', 'watch', 'necessary.It', 'used', 'be', 'presses', 'job', 'give', 'facts', 'days', 'there', 'be', 'gag', 'order', 'members', 'media', 'especially', 'when', 'administration', 'war', 'Iraq', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'wife', 'outed', 'being', 'CIA', 'do', 'made', 'secret', 'fact', 'was', 'trying', 'influence', 'outcome', '2004', 'presidential', 'election', 'putting', 'film', 'out', 'when', 'did', 'almost', 'worked', 'end', 'Carl', 'Rove', 'other', 'masterminds', 'who', 'work', 'Bush', 'managed', 'prevail', 'smear', 'slander', 'managed', 'trash', 'Moore', 'film', 'sent', 'swift-boat', 'vets', 'take', 'care', 'John', 'Kerry.Republicans', 'everywhere', 'condemned', ""Moores'film"", 'pack', 'lies', 'had', 'real', 'way', 'explaining', 'away', 'facts', 'presented', 'it.Limbaugh', 'condemned', 'film', 'admitted', 'listeners', 'never', 'seen', 'instead', 'took', 'advise', 'people', 'who', 'told', 'was', 'cut', 'paste', 'job', 'Strange', 'coming', 'guy', 'who', 'often', 'people', 'critisize', 'show', 'ever', 'having', 'heard', 'let', 'get', 'back', 'Moore', '911', 'must', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'try', 'make', 'sense', 'what', 'happened', 'Washington', 'country', 'cases', 'September', '11', '2001', 'apparent', 'Bush', 'administration', 'was', 'not', 'focused', 'terrorist', 'threat', 'tragic', 'day', 'was', 'history', 'tried', 'take', 'advantage', 'form', 'convincing', 'Americans', 'country', 'Iraq', 'leader', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'were', 'imminent', 'threat', 'needed', 'be', 'dealt', 'immediately', '911', 'also', 'about', 'much', 'more', 'corruption', 'politics', 'how', 'effects', 'country', 'who', 'still', 'believe', 'America', 'great', 'place', 'freedom', 'great', 'blessing', 'caveat', 'movie', 'freedoms', 'are', 'assault', 'not', 'bit', 'Patriot', 'Act', 'illegal', 'immigration', 'silencing', 'media', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'protect', 'freedom', 'dealing', 'cold', 'hard', 'facts.So', 'can', 'harp', 'fact', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'overweight', 'guy', 'who', 'slob', 'can', 'attest', 'fact', 'one', 'hell', 'documentary', 'forces', 'think']",Fahrenheit 9/11
630193,A1S8AJIUIO6M9K,B00005JNEI,Robert David STEELE Vivas,"[10, 13]","My teen-age son specializes in techno-art and his comment to me costs this film one star--he says that the out of context mixing of video clips is very low rent and almost unethical.  Seems like a very good point.The film does, however, offer many important points that I summarize here for those who have been--as I was--reluctant to invest the time or money in this controversial film.  It *is* worth buying or renting and watching.The most important point early on is many Members of the House of Representative demanded Congressional action in the aftermath of the known illegal disenfranchisement of people of color across Florida, and not a single Senator, including Al Gore as President of the Senate, was willing to sign on and force the issue.  For this alone Al Gore will never get a vote from me, and I am fairly disgusted with the entire body.  I am *very* surprised that Senator Byrd did not sign on, and wonder what kind of deal was made in the back rooms of the Senate.  From that one decision have stemmed 6 years going on eight of a half trillion dollar war with thousands of dead and tens of thousands of amputees and disabled veterans whom Bush has been trying to sideline, cutting their benefits and medical care.He reminds us of the eggs thrown on the motorcade on inaugural day, and the documented fact that Bush was on vacation 42% of the time in his first 8 months.Not one meeting on terrorism in all that time.  The film is in error in claiming Bush did not read the 6 August report.  As James Risen notes in ""State of War"" Bush got a frantic personal briefing from CIA, and then blew them off with the obscene comments ""OK, you've covered your ass on this.""The film traces the connection between Saudi money, Bush, and his National Guard flying buddy Bath, and the later the Carlyle Group, where partner George Bush Senior was the ONLY President to continue to demand CIA briefings after retirement.  The film correctly points out that $1.4 billion dollars from the Saudis invested in the Bush family carries a lot more weight than the $400K a year salary from the taxpayer, one reason, no doubt, why 142 Saudis got to fly out of America on 6 private planes after 9/11 while all Americans were grounded.We are reminded of George Bush Juniors obstruction of justice in the 9/11 Commission investigation, and pointedly reminded that Iraq was put in play on 13 September despite strong assertions from Dick Clark and others that Iraq had nothing to do with the attack.We are reminding that Attorney General John Ashcroft lost his Senate race against a dead man still on the ballot, and that Ashcroft pointedly told the FBI he did not want to hear about terrorism.The movie overall highlights Donald Rumsfeld as a fraud, with clips of his speaking about the ""humanity of precision targeting"" followed by clips of mass destruction.There is a fascinating discussion of how poverty across America is producing recruits for the military who would not normally volunteer, and then pointedly shown Congressmen ducking interviews because only 1 of the 535 has a son in Iraq.There are moving interviews with people who lost children in Iraq, and two points jump out: the first is that the general public does not distinguish between the need to honor their loved one's sacrifice and our Armed Forces, and the need to condemn and hold accountable the political leadership that lied to all Americans, to Congress, and to the United Nations.The second point is that those who lost children do not blame Al Qaeda; they blame the political leadership of America, but not in a strong enough manner to demand impeachment (yet).The movie concludes that the object of war is continuous war to keep the current hierarchical system of wealth, power, and privilege in place.It's a very strong creative effort, marred only slightly by what my teen-age son considers to be video editing slights of hand.",4,"Too Glib By Half, But Many Important Points",1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,3903,"['teen-age', 'son', 'techno-art', 'comment', 'film', 'one', 'star', 'out', 'context', 'mixing', 'video', 'clips', 'very', 'low', 'rent', 'almost', 'unethical', 'very', 'good', 'point.The', 'film', 'however', 'offer', 'many', 'important', 'points', 'summarize', 'here', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'reluctant', 'invest', 'time', 'money', 'controversial', 'film', '*is*', 'worth', 'buying', 'renting', 'most', 'important', 'point', 'early', 'many', 'Members', 'House', 'Representative', 'demanded', 'Congressional', 'action', 'aftermath', 'known', 'illegal', 'disenfranchisement', 'people', 'color', 'Florida', 'not', 'single', 'Senator', 'including', 'Al', 'Gore', 'President', 'Senate', 'was', 'willing', 'sign', 'force', 'issue', 'alone', 'Al', 'Gore', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'vote', 'am', 'fairly', 'disgusted', 'entire', 'body', 'am', '*very*', 'surprised', 'Senator', 'Byrd', 'did', 'not', 'sign', 'wonder', 'what', 'kind', 'deal', 'was', 'made', 'back', 'rooms', 'Senate', 'one', 'decision', 'have', 'stemmed', '6', 'years', 'going', 'eight', 'half', 'trillion', 'dollar', 'war', 'thousands', 'dead', 'tens', 'thousands', 'amputees', 'disabled', 'veterans', 'whom', 'Bush', 'been', 'trying', 'sideline', 'cutting', 'benefits', 'medical', 'care.He', 'eggs', 'thrown', 'motorcade', 'inaugural', 'day', 'documented', 'fact', 'Bush', 'was', 'vacation', '42', '%', 'time', 'first', '8', 'months.Not', 'one', 'meeting', 'terrorism', 'time', 'film', 'error', 'claiming', 'Bush', 'did', 'not', 'read', '6', 'August', 'report', 'James', 'Risen', 'notes', 'State', 'War', 'Bush', 'got', 'frantic', 'personal', 'briefing', 'CIA', 'then', 'blew', 'off', 'obscene', 'comments', 'OK', ""'ve"", 'covered', 'ass', 'film', 'connection', 'Saudi', 'money', 'Bush', 'National', 'Guard', 'flying', 'buddy', 'Bath', 'later', 'Carlyle', 'Group', 'where', 'partner', 'George', 'Bush', 'Senior', 'was', 'ONLY', 'President', 'continue', 'demand', 'CIA', 'briefings', 'retirement', 'film', 'correctly', 'out', '1.4', 'billion', 'dollars', 'Saudis', 'invested', 'Bush', 'family', 'lot', 'more', 'weight', '400K', 'year', 'salary', 'taxpayer', 'one', 'reason', 'doubt', 'why', '142', 'Saudis', 'got', 'fly', 'America', '6', 'private', 'planes', '9/11', 'Americans', 'were', 'grounded.We', 'are', 'reminded', 'George', 'Bush', 'Juniors', 'obstruction', 'justice', '9/11', 'Commission', 'investigation', 'pointedly', 'reminded', 'Iraq', 'was', 'put', 'play', '13', 'September', 'strong', 'assertions', 'Dick', 'Clark', 'others', 'Iraq', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'attack.We', 'are', 'reminding', 'Attorney', 'General', 'John', 'Ashcroft', 'lost', 'Senate', 'race', 'dead', 'man', 'still', 'ballot', 'Ashcroft', 'pointedly', 'told', 'FBI', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'hear', 'terrorism.The', 'movie', 'overall', 'highlights', 'Donald', 'Rumsfeld', 'fraud', 'clips', 'speaking', 'humanity', 'precision', 'targeting', 'followed', 'clips', 'mass', 'fascinating', 'discussion', 'how', 'poverty', 'America', 'producing', 'recruits', 'military', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'normally', 'volunteer', 'then', 'pointedly', 'shown', 'Congressmen', 'ducking', 'interviews', 'only', '1', '535', 'son', 'Iraq.There', 'are', 'moving', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'lost', 'children', 'Iraq', 'two', 'points', 'jump', 'out', 'first', 'general', 'public', 'not', 'distinguish', 'need', 'honor', 'loved', 'one', 'sacrifice', 'Armed', 'Forces', 'need', 'condemn', 'hold', 'accountable', 'political', 'leadership', 'lied', 'Americans', 'Congress', 'United', 'Nations.The', 'second', 'point', 'who', 'lost', 'children', 'do', 'not', 'blame', 'Al', 'Qaeda', 'blame', 'political', 'leadership', 'America', 'not', 'strong', 'enough', 'manner', 'demand', 'impeachment', 'yet', '.The', 'movie', 'object', 'war', 'continuous', 'war', 'keep', 'current', 'hierarchical', 'system', 'wealth', 'power', 'privilege', 'place.It', 'very', 'strong', 'creative', 'effort', 'marred', 'only', 'slightly', 'what', 'teen-age', 'son', 'considers', 'be', 'video', 'editing', 'slights', 'hand']",Fahrenheit 9/11

630196,AW3FTPCBPVQNB,B00005JNEI,Robert J. Schneider,"[44, 63]","The good news: I just came back from watching a great Horror movie. The bad news: the Horror is real. Michael Moore, the documentary filmmaker famous for his flat Midwestern accent, his girth and brilliant muckraking films such as ROGER & ME (1989), THE BIG ONE (1997) and BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE (2002, this one unseen by me as of yet), has crafted what may be his ultimate depiction of sad reality. This is about our nation's present situation in Iraq and how we came to be there, how it is currently being fought, how it is justified by those who are in power but don't have any children serving in Iraq, etc. It begins with a pre-title sequence showing the horrific event that started this ball rolling: the stealing of the Presidency by George W. Bush.From the early days of the Bush Administration, which show Georgie out fishing in Kennebunkport, Maine, relaxing in his ranch in Crawford, Texas (and claiming to be ""taking care of business"" in the meantime), to the aftermath of September 11, 2001, we are presented with the facts as they unfurled before various videocameras and live cable feeds. We are presented with an administration run by men whose families have strong business and personal ties with Saudi Arabian government officials and billionaire businessmen, with a Vice President whose oil company he chaired (immediately before his current job of serving the public as the nation's #2 man) being granted one no-bid contract after the other, and reaping billions in dollars in profit in the process, with soldiers being targeted for recruitment out of the poorest neighborhoods (that were, ironically, made even poorer by the current administration's economic policies) by slathering Marine recruiters to fight a war---a war that they had nothing to do with, against an enemy who had never laid hands on American soil or an American citizen, for a cause that was misrepresented to begin with, to fight a war that supposedly ended on May 1st of last year, and which is still being fought as these words are being typed today. As you are reading them on some other day. Perhaps while one of your loved ones is fighting. Or being killed. That, I believe, is the point of FAHRENHEIT 9/11 (2004), a film made---believe it or not---to honor those who face this daily hell, either as a soldier or an agonized family member. A hell that they did not create, yet are expected to ""win.""Some of you reading this review may be among those who accuse Michael Moore of politicizing this war, or 9/11 itself. Yet by actually *watching* this film, it is clearly seen that George W. Bush (along with his entire entourage of Cabinet members such as Vice President Dick Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Assistant Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, Secretary of State Colin Powell and National Security Adviser Condoleeza Rice) has politicized the war by sporadically using the ""Security Level Alert"" system (or whatever it's called) to create fear and tension throughout the American populace, and using that fear to hype-up support for a war that has been waged almost entirely for business reasons; ironically, for reasons that hold no benefit whatsoever for the average American. As one war-supporting woman in the film says, you may think the events in this film are all ""staged."" Sure they were staged; by the President, his Cabinet officials, by the U.S. military, even by the national network TV news stations. Lastly, some of you may decry this film as ""propaganda."" Oh, I *love* that one! You want propaganda? Turn on Fox News Channel any day of the week, any time of the day---there, you'll get Bush Admin propaganda 24/7.Still want to accuse Michael Moore of political propagandizing? Fine, but think about this: at least his ""propaganda"" hasn't directly led to hundreds (perhaps soon to be thousands) of American soldiers losing their lives. Or to thousands (perhaps soon to be tens of thousands) of innocent Iraqi people being killed by their ""protectors."" All Moore is doing is encapsulating reality, by shrinking down the millions of hours of broadcasting and giving us the facts. The facts like the Saudi Arabian embassy being across the street from the Watergate hotel and prominent U.S. Government buildings (the only such embassy, by the way, that has continual Secret Service protection). Facts such as arch-conservative (and former Nixon administration official) Richard Perle confessing that Bush had gotten it all wrong when he decided to go after Iraq. Facts like a self-proclaimed ""conservative"" from Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan who had been a strong war-supporter, until that very war took the life of her son. Other facts too numerous to mention here. For more information as to how wrong our current path is, please see this film.

Luckily the controversy is what's bringing the audience in, and what they get is a dose of reality, and two hours of hard to phathom information.I was moved beyond words by this picture. People were stunned. The women next to me gasped a few times at some of the content, and what was said and done during this film. While I didn't ""enjoy"" this film as one might enjoy this summer's ""SpiderMan"" blockbuster, I did find this film to stand on it's own as one of the most important films ever made. Bravo to Moore for voicing his opinions and letting the general public in on the little secrets. Voices should be heard and not silenced.

At the end of the full contents of the dvd, including features, etc., I sat back and in my mind I let it all sink in.  I must have spent an hour just digesting all that I viewed.  The opening, showing a close up of Bush, sitting there in front of the children, with his usual photo op, staged and choreographed as has been the practice of this presidency, worked in reverse and actually showed the naked truth for a change. Here was the seven minute void, showing an presidential aid whispering in his ear that the country had been attacked. The close up showing Bush's expression and demeanor,the eye movement and freeze, captured by the video was startling, the picking up of a book and the vacant stare, all that was missing was a, ""dunce cap."" Without someone pulling his strings and feeding him hidden written notes.  Here was the birth of a self proclaimed, SUPER SUPER COMMANDER-IN CHIEF."" This video clip when viewed world wide will definitely not leave a positive impression to all the terrorists lurking in the shadows.  The aforementioned was in my opinion a highlight of this dvd.  Of course all the other video clips and speeches were also of great significance.The vido clip which described  the joint appearance of Bush and Cheney re:9/11 so called investigation by a committee held behind closed doors, not under oath, was described by Bush as he appeared before reporters, ""as a friendly conversation,"" or words to that effect, was extremely revealing.  A reporter asked if appearing jointly with Cheney was a way to keep their stories straight, Bush as is his wont, fixed a sickly grin and uttered something ridiculous.This documentary was excellent and I would personally rate it in excess of *****.Finally, this documentary has been critized by many of the younger generation who with adoring eyes, wave banners depicting, ""we love Bush,"" and, ""four more years,"" which to me equals, ""four more arrears.""

Kiser Sr.,"[21, 36]","In the last two days I have watched ""Fahrenheit 911"" two times.I wish that I could say that 90% of this film is nothing more than crap. But I can not say that.I do know that what was suggested to me was that MONEY RULES the world. The rich keep the poor exactly where they want them. And there is a balance that must be struck. Oh it is ok if a few slip through and make it up to the big time. They are not a threat. They always join the club and quickly forget where they came from.I guess my being raised in an orphanage and being treated like a piece of crap, for many years, has made me aware of what the rich can do to those living below their standards.Could what happened in Russia, Iraq and Germany, as well as many other countries in the world ever happen here in America? Of course it could. The citizens of those countries thought it could never happen there either. One day they woke up and the monster had appeared it's ugly head. By then it was to late for the common-man to do anything about it.POWER is a strange creature. It makes men very greedy and very selfish. Some in high places think that power gives them permission to steal, cheat, lie and even kill.Are there no common-men, or women, who are not wealthly, who are smart enough to serve in the Congress or the Senate? If so, where are they? Why is it that the rich always seem to grab power in almost every country in the world?What are the chances that any one family can be smart enough to have two Congressmen, or two Senators, a Governor or even two Presidents come from the same family? How is that possible? It is possible because of money and power. Of course it is...It happens in both political parties. And it will happen in a third party should one ever be formed.The film to me is not about what is TRUE or FALSE. It is about what could possibly become TRUTH if power is not kept in check. And if it does happen it will be because we did it to ourselves. One day your brother, or your sister might rise up against you. If and when they do; it will be because it is the only way that they can save themselves. This has happened many times in the course of history.One must look far beyond the film itself.I sometimes wonder when I watch television and see Hilter speaking to the massive german crowds. If the people attending the speech looked at that gathering as a political type convention. I see those same looks, screams and yells coming from both the Republican and Democratic convention attendees.

630204,A134FLH2KNA0JU,B00005JNEI,Roger McEvilly (the guilty bystander),"[5, 7]","This is a documentary which presents the view that the US-led war in Iraq is a tragic and purposeless waste of time and life, which ultimately only serves to suit the financial and political power structures within the US. I don't agree with Mr Moore's team on everything, but I agree with what he is trying to do - paint the full picture of the tragedy that is modern day Iraq (which is always difficult to get from the press). Fahrenheit 9/11 is a good and timely film. Open discussion of such complex issues itself justifies the film, despite what some ultra-conservatives might think. But at the end of the day, his lack of impartiality and blatant selectivity, including the derisive and selective theatrical style, will not, in the end, suit his ultimate cause (which is 'reality'). In the end he uses techniques and a selective style which he also accuses in those with whom he has disagreement.My advice is, if you want a rule of thumb for these kind of political documentaries, you would do well by simply believing the truth is somewhere in the middle. Much of what Mr Moore implies is difficult to substantiate, which by any measure would mean that some of it is probably true, some isn't. People are not very good statisticians by nature (let's face it who is), therefore you often get polarised views from such documentaries - one is either very much in agreement, or very much against. A little moderation does not go astray here.You could argue incessantly about the details, and Moore's attack on the Bush Administration might well contain strong elements of truth, however this doesn't necessarily justify blanket accusations and the blatant selectivity. Carefully placed and themed music, selectivity of example, bias justified by humour (with ridicule), camera angles (also justified by humour) and at the end of the day, the same applied to his conclusions, means truth becomes subservient to polemic, the cause, or cinematic effect. This is not really the answer to a tragedy such as modern day Iraq.Nevertheless there is a lot of good stuff here that is worth mentioning. This includes that having business or family contacts doesn't necessarily translate to astute political leadership or social understanding, that the poor and the young often seem to get the raw end of the deal, that fear is often at the root of political or social strife, or that mineral and oil resources, and who owns or uses them, play a bigger part in our lives than we often think.Selectivity of example includes the following: other people than the poor and unemployed go to fight in Iraq, and the portrayal of Iraq that all was well and happy prior to the US-led invasion was grossly inadequate. What also is not mentioned is an important security issue with regards to the Iraqi style of government-regardless of WMDs- there was, (rightly or wrongly), a perceived potential of future terrorist complicity, something that was difficult if not impossible to minimise through the former regime. One of the best ways to minimise terrorist activities is through resources available to government and through international co-operation, the fact was, that Iraq was perceived (rightly or wrongly) to fail in all such respects from this perspective-regardless of the presence or non-presence of WMDs. However this doesn't necessarily justify what might be labelled, in this circumstance, a 'pre-emptive' invasion.The level of Saudi involvement in the US is, at best, ambiguous in nature, as such trade relationships have benefits for many on both sides (not just those who own resources or trade with them). Put simply, the irony is that less business integration might create more, or different problems.One final point-there is no such temperature as '9/11'-the title contains mixed, non-compatible concepts (ie temperature mixed with date). A small, completely irrelevant technical detail one might say, where concepts have been mixed within a title for obvious dramatic effect. But this is the difference between drama and reality. If you apply this technique to the rest of the film, Mr Moore's film becomes, at least partially, self-defeating. Small, (apparently) irrelevant truths and non-compatible concepts have been altered or mixed for dramatic effect, which is pretty much what he accuses others of doing.",3,Hot and cold,1090713600,"07 25, 2004",2004,4312,"['documentary', 'view', 'US-led', 'war', 'Iraq', 'tragic', 'purposeless', 'waste', 'time', 'life', 'ultimately', 'only', 'suit', 'financial', 'political', 'power', 'structures', 'US', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'Mr', 'Moore', 'team', 'everything', 'agree', 'what', 'trying', 'do', 'paint', 'full', 'picture', 'tragedy', 'modern', 'day', 'Iraq', 'always', 'difficult', 'get', 'press', '9/11', 'good', 'timely', 'film', 'Open', 'discussion', 'such', 'complex', 'issues', 'film', 'what', 'ultra-conservatives', 'might', 'think', 'end', 'day', 'lack', 'impartiality', 'blatant', 'selectivity', 'including', 'derisive', 'selective', 'theatrical', 'style', 'will', 'not', 'end', 'suit', 'ultimate', 'cause', ""'reality"", 'end', 'techniques', 'selective', 'style', 'also', 'whom', 'disagreement.My', 'advice', 'want', 'rule', 'thumb', 'kind', 'political', 'documentaries', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'simply', 'believing', 'truth', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'Much', 'what', 'Mr', 'Moore', 'implies', 'difficult', 'substantiate', 'measure', 'would', 'mean', 'probably', 'true', ""n't"", 'People', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'statisticians', 'nature', 'let', 'face', 'who', 'therefore', 'often', 'get', 'polarised', 'views', 'such', 'documentaries', 'one', 'very', 'much', 'agreement', 'very', 'much', 'little', 'moderation', 'not', 'go', 'astray', 'here.You', 'could', 'argue', 'incessantly', 'details', 'Moore', 'attack', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'might', 'well', 'contain', 'strong', 'elements', 'truth', 'however', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'justify', 'blanket', 'accusations', 'blatant', 'selectivity', 'Carefully', 'placed', 'themed', 'music', 'selectivity', 'example', 'bias', 'justified', 'humour', 'ridicule', 'camera', 'angles', 'also', 'justified', 'humour', 'end', 'day', 'same', 'applied', 'conclusions', 'truth', 'becomes', 'subservient', 'polemic', 'cause', 'cinematic', 'effect', 'not', 'really', 'answer', 'tragedy', 'such', 'modern', 'day', 'Iraq.Nevertheless', 'lot', 'good', 'stuff', 'here', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'having', 'business', 'family', 'contacts', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'translate', 'astute', 'political', 'leadership', 'social', 'understanding', 'poor', 'young', 'often', 'seem', 'get', 'raw', 'end', 'deal', 'fear', 'often', 'root', 'political', 'social', 'strife', 'mineral', 'oil', 'resources', 'who', 'play', 'bigger', 'part', 'lives', 'often', 'think.Selectivity', 'example', 'following', 'other', 'people', 'poor', 'unemployed', 'go', 'fight', 'Iraq', 'portrayal', 'Iraq', 'was', 'well', 'happy', 'prior', 'US-led', 'invasion', 'was', 'grossly', 'inadequate', 'What', 'also', 'not', 'mentioned', 'important', 'security', 'issue', 'regards', 'Iraqi', 'style', 'government-regardless', 'WMDs-', 'was', 'rightly', 'wrongly', 'perceived', 'potential', 'future', 'terrorist', 'complicity', 'something', 'was', 'difficult', 'not', 'impossible', 'minimise', 'former', 'regime', 'One', 'best', 'ways', 'minimise', 'terrorist', 'activities', 'resources', 'available', 'government', 'international', 'co-operation', 'fact', 'was', 'Iraq', 'was', 'perceived', 'rightly', 'wrongly', 'fail', 'such', 'respects', 'perspective-regardless', 'presence', 'non-presence', 'WMDs', 'However', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'justify', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'labelled', 'circumstance', ""'pre-emptive"", 'invasion.The', 'level', 'Saudi', 'involvement', 'US', 'best', 'ambiguous', 'nature', 'such', 'trade', 'relationships', 'have', 'benefits', 'many', 'sides', 'not', 'just', 'who', 'own', 'resources', 'trade', 'Put', 'simply', 'irony', 'less', 'business', 'integration', 'might', 'create', 'more', 'different', 'problems.One', 'final', 'point-there', 'such', 'temperature', ""9/11'-the"", 'title', 'contains', 'mixed', 'non-compatible', 'concepts', 'ie', 'temperature', 'mixed', 'date', 'small', 'completely', 'irrelevant', 'technical', 'detail', 'one', 'might', 'say', 'where', 'concepts', 'have', 'been', 'mixed', 'title', 'obvious', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'difference', 'drama', 'reality', 'apply', 'technique', 'rest', 'film', 'Mr', 'Moore', 'film', 'least', 'partially', 'self-defeating', 'Small', 'apparently', 'irrelevant', 'truths', 'non-compatible', 'concepts', 'have', 'been', 'altered', 'mixed', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'others', 'doing']",Fahrenheit 9/11
630205,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JNEI,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 10]","****1/2When Michael Moore`s controversial documentary ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" was released in the summer of 2004, it hit a readiness reaction with a large segment of the American public, people who found themselves increasingly dissatisfied with the direction the country was taking under the Bush administration and who believed that, in this film, someone for the first time was finally giving voice, in a mass media outlet, to their deepest held fears and concerns.  Let's face it; no fiction writer could have concocted a more bizarre and surrealistic series of events than what actually occurred in the United States in the first few years of this millennium:  a contested Presidential election followed by a terrorist attack of unprecedented proportions followed by a ""retaliatory"" war aimed at the wrong country and based almost entirely on faulty intelligence.  These three incidents converged to create a near ""perfect storm"" for Moore's documentary.  It also didn't hurt, from a commercial point of view, that the film was released in the heat of a bruising Presidential campaign, one in which the stakes never seemed higher for both ends of the political spectrum in the country.  The 2004 Presidential election would be a fight to the death, one whose motto was clearly: may the better ideology win.Well, it has been a year since Moore's film hit the streets and almost as long a time since Bush won reelection for a second term as president.  The question to be asked now is, with the passions on both sides cooled down to at least some extent (or are they?), how does ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" play in a post-election world?  The answer is pretty damn well actually, mainly because most of the issues Moore raises are still as valid after the election as they were before (mainly because Bush WAS reelected).Moore is, of course, an unapologetic liberal and a self-appointed gadfly for the powers-that-be in our society.  As such, he aims his sights directly at the Bush administration and all those who support it.  He starts off brilliantly by recalling the horrors of 9/11 in a unique way: showing us a black screen while the sounds of the planes crashing into the buildings are heard on the soundtrack.  With memories of that horror still lingering in our heads, Moore then proceeds to expose the Bush family's long standing connections with the Saudi royal family, a fact that few people seemed aware of before this film was released.  Moore then goes on to criticize the way in which the Bush administration has exploited the ""War on Terror"" for maximum political effectiveness, culminating in the Patriot Act which, he argues, has had a draconian impact on the civil rights of ordinary American citizens.But the greatest part of Moore's wrath is saved for the second half of the film, when he confronts what he sees as the wholly unjustifiable war in Iraq.  Moore is to be given credit for being one of the first and only people to have shown us actual on-the-ground pictures of the death and carnage that occurred in that country immediately after the initial bombings.  Watching these gruesome images, we are immediately struck by just how antiseptic the media's coverage of the war has been here in the United States - a fact that Moore blames not only on the Bush administration but on a press that has allowed itself to become little more than an extension of the rah-rah, war-rallying propaganda machine set up by the government (a government, for instance, that refused to allow any pictures to be taken of flag-draped coffins coming back from the war zone).The section dealing with the Iraq War is the most emotionally devastating section of the film, mainly because Moore is able to bring it home to us personally through the ordinary individuals who have been most directly affected by it - soldiers on the field, amputees in the hospital and, most heartbreakingly, the mother of a boy killed in a helicopter crash in April, 2003.  Her unbearable grief, so nakedly exposed on camera for all to see, becomes an emblem for a war that not only need not have happened, but has, as Moore points out in various ways, been largely bought and paid for with the blood of brave men and women from the lower, underprivileged tier of society.  He ends his film by confronting a number of congressmen who voted for the war but who seem reluctant to send their own children over to do the actual fighting.  Actually, there is so much going on in this film that it becomes virtually impossible to convey even half of it in a short review such as this one.As with his previous films, Moore once again proves himself the master of facile irony, pointing out, in darkly humorous fashion, the absurd inconsistencies and blatant hypocrisies that abound in the world around us.  These moments are what keep Moore's films from becoming dry-as-dust jeremiads against what he sees as a corrupt system.  He makes us laugh even when we know we should be crying, but this is the way a polemicist reaches his audience.  And no one understands that better than Michael Moore.Is the film ""fair,"" ""balanced,"" ""nonpartisan"" in its approach?  Absolutely not.  Does it need to be?  Well, I can certainly see where people of the opposite political persuasion might find themselves wanting to yell back at the screen or lob a few well chosen projectiles where they feel it would do the most good.  And that's fine too.  After all, it's a free country and the Bush supporters have every right to launch their own rebuttal against this film if they so choose.  I would truly love to see it.  But until that time both liberals and conservatives will have to be content with kicking the set every time ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is appearing on the screen.  The funny thing is that they'll be doing so for entirely different reasons.",4,knockout documentary,1123459200,"08 8, 2005",2005,5800,"['****1/2When', 'Michael', 'Moore', 's', 'controversial',

630206,ADKA2MJQQCMTO,B00005JNEI,Ron Sullivan,"[14, 19]","Jeeze ... this film has become such a lightening-rod, I'd like to be as careful as I can in my review to leave my own political opinions out of it.There were certain things I wanted to see when I sat down to watch the film.  I've always felt that in a documentary, structure and integrity are absolutely critical to the success of the piece.  That may sound fairly obvious, but Moore's 'Bowling for Columbine' took a LOT of liberties with a TON of the facts it was using to build it's argument as well as jumping all over the place, subject wise (Tim McVey/NRA/Lockheed Martin/the media/K-Mart ... dammit Mike ... pick one and stick with it).  I wanted to see it demonstrated that Moore was past that and trusted his facts enough to present his argument.So how did he do?  Well ... it's better then 'Columbine.' I still think Moore hit his high-water mark with 'Roger and Me,' but it IS better then the irresponsible 'Columbine.' For the most part, it passed the smell test.  On Moore's web-site he made sure to present the sources he used for his information so the audience could see where he was drawing his conclusions from.Granted, several facts have since been de-bunked by the 9-11 commission, but GENERALLY speaking he's much more accurate here then 'Columbine' was in its best moment.  The habit that Moore seems to have developed that drives me crazy though, is that he's too prone to (not always, but sometimes) build a particular argument on HIS INTERPRETATION OF facts, instead of the facts themselves.  This occasionally leads Moore to start getting really carried away with a few of his conspiracy theories (... a pipeline though the middle-east?).The thing that Moore really has a knack for, is capturing the ridiculous side of human nature and being able to make people laugh at themselves during the worst of times.  I'm thinking of the segments with the ""office parachute"" or the sealed ""anti-terrorist pot-a-john.""  There's not enough though, I would have loved it if there was a little more of this kind of humor.Moore still jumps subjects a little too much.  I'd love for him to just sit down and make a film on JUST the 2000 election or JUST FOX New's right-wing bias or JUST the way fear is used in today's society.  As it is in Fahrenheit, Moore tries to cover every subject and as a result, some interesting work winds up feeling half-finished.As a whole, if you take this as an Op/Ed piece, it instantly becomes a lot better.  For Bush supporters, you have to realize that this piece is NOT the least bit ""fair or balanced"" as Fox News would say.  For the Left, you also need to remember that Moore HAS an agenda and he's been proven in the past to be a little loose with the truth to make his point.  Just because it's such an open-handed slap at Bush, doesn't mean that it's good.  Don't be afraid to challenge Moore and to research his facts on you own.  What you may learn will only strengthen your own convictions.There in lies the value in a piece such as this.  It will incite people who may not normally follow the political process to get involved and educate themselves.

Right from the start I could see this was going to be far too biased and misleading to be taken seriously.  Moore's efforts to discredit the Bush regime are pretty laughable in places.  Then again, footage of Iraqi civilians killed and injured by the American army are powerful and moving, and interviews with soldiers who seem to find the whole thing &quot;awesome&quot; and a &quot;rush&quot; really do stir the anti-American, anti-war sentiments.  All the more confusing when, after showing them to be such a brainless and dislikable bunch, the film turns into a tribute to the soldiers and the sacrifices they make.

Like Eisenstein's Odessa Steps or D. W. Griffith's Piedmont, S.C., Moore uses place (Flint and Washington) as a microcosm for abstract ideas about the inequality and incalculable costs of a nation's war-making ways.  And like both of those acclaimed directors, he uses montage effectively.  In fact, the shot of children playing in a near-bucolic Baghdag prior to the American bombing is reminiscent of Coppola's shot of a pastoral Vietnam village just before Robert Duval blows it to smithereens in Apocalypse Now.Less effective are Moore's own appearances in the film.  Far from the subtlety of a Hitchcock, they bear the sophomoric heavy-handedness of a Saturday Night Live skit.  Moreover, doesn't Moore understand that this much attention brought to the messenger can only serve to detract from the strength and lasting impression of the message?Also, I'm surprised that the film spends so little time implicating Cheney and the President's men.  By concentrating so intently and frequently on an obtuse and arrogant-looking Bush, the film makes him a more memorable, colorful character than he deserves to be.  As far as the war's supporters are concerned, this film could actually strengthen true believers' attachment to the present leader as a misunderstood, misrepresented banner carrier.The best-written, most effective parts of the film are the beginning and end, where Moore is able to make the point that neither in Florida nor in Baghdad could the conservative base and keepers of the corporate store tolerate a loss, much less a conclusive victory.  Quoting Orwell, Moore leaves us with a chilling reminder of why war in itself serves the interests of the privileged and the powerful.",4,"He's No Eisenstein, Riefenstahl, Griffith or Coppola",1089244800,"07 8, 2004",2004,1913,"['Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'far', 'classic', 'piece', 'film', 'rhetoric', 'propaganda', 'indie', 'film', 'produced', 'limited', 'finances', 'marginal', 'film', 'stock', 'limited', 'access', 'government', 'records', 'etc', 'not', 'bad', 'Eisenstein', 'Odessa', 'Steps', 'D.', 'W.', 'Griffith', 'Piedmont', 'S.C.', 'Moore', 'place', 'Flint', 'Washington', 'microcosm', 'abstract', 'ideas', 'inequality', 'incalculable', 'costs', 'nation', 'war-making', 'ways', 'acclaimed', 'directors', 'montage', 'effectively', 'fact', 'shot', 'children', 'playing', 'near-bucolic', 'Baghdag', 'prior', 'American', 'bombing', 'reminiscent', 'Coppola', 'shot', 'pastoral', 'Vietnam', 'village', 'just', 'Robert', 'Duval', 'smithereens', 'Apocalypse', 'Now.Less', 'effective', 'are', 'Moore', 'own', 'appearances', 'film', 'Far', 'subtlety', 'Hitchcock', 'bear', 'sophomoric', 'heavy-handedness', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'skit', 'Moreover', ""n't"", 'Moore', 'understand', 'much', 'attention', 'brought', 'messenger', 'can', 'only', 'serve', 'detract', 'strength', 'lasting', 'impression', 'message', 'Also', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'film', 'so', 'little', 'time', 'implicating', 'Cheney', 'President', 'men', 'concentrating', 'so', 'intently', 'frequently', 'obtuse', 'arrogant-looking', 'Bush', 'film', 'more', 'memorable', 'colorful', 'character', 'be', 'As', 'far', 'war', 'supporters', 'are', 'concerned', 'film', 'could', 'actually', 'strengthen', 'true', 'believers', 'attachment', 'present', 'leader', 'misunderstood', 'misrepresented', 'carrier.The', 'best-written', 'most', 'effective', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'beginning', 'end', 'where', 'Moore', 'able', 'make', 'point', 'Florida', 'Baghdad', 'could', 'conservative', 'base', 'keepers', 'corporate', 'store', 'tolerate', 'loss', 'much', 'less', 'conclusive', 'victory', 'Quoting', 'Orwell', 'Moore', 'chilling', 'reminder', 'why', 'war', 'interests', 'privileged', 'powerful']",Fahrenheit 9/11
630224,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00005JNEI,Samuel McKewon,"[0, 13]","Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" teems with passion and patriotism, and it is a triumph of American individualism: Here is Moore and his small team firing one of the strongest volleys against the Bush administration over its handling of the terrorist attacks, the invasion of Afghanistan and, to the filmmaker, an unjust war in Iraq. Moore, fat and shabby, reviled by an entire political party, is not only crafting a small personal gem (""Roger & Me"") or a scattershot rant (""Bowling for Columbine"") but a politcal lightning rod setting theaters afire.With comedy and outrage, Moore articulates the liberal mood in ways mainstream media and political columnists cannot: It is that moment in ""Network"" when Howard Beale calls viewers to their windows to yell they're mad as hell, and they're not gonna take it anymore. Like Beale, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is manic and conspiratorial; it goes all the way. So far, in fact, as to explain an undermanned, half-baked invasion in Afghanistan as a dual mission to install some natural gas pipeline running through the region. But while Moore explictly indicts Bush and his ""warmakers"" - Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, John Ashcroft and George H. W. Bush chiefly -  his movie thrums with indictment and instruction for most Americans, and to ignore or skip it for its liberal viewpoint is to ignore or miss Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" for its Christianity.If you care about political discourse - or even your place in the machine of this republic - buy a ticket.The movie is Moore's comprehensive argument against all that has happened since Bush's election, beginning with the ratification of that election, as Al Gore, still head of the Senate as Vice President, gavels black Congressmen and Congresswomen into silence as they protest W's narrow, Supreme Court-approved victory. The scene runs underneath the entirety of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"": Most Democrats tacitly agree, or remain timid, in the face of Bush's bull run after 9/11. Moore never relents in showing Bush's financial connection to the Saudi royal family - which may have allowed members of the Bin Laden family to leave just days after 9/11 - or his administration's seemingly deliberate use of the terrorist warning system to ratchet fear up and down as if the public were a violin. But, as Moore shows, the media tags along. Fox News touts poison pens. Dan Rather admits he's rooting for ""my country"" to win. After the Iraqi invasion Ted Koppel marvels at the remarkable American killing machine as it races its way to Baghdad. And Democrats preach about ""staying the course,"" fearful of the conservative backlash, certain - correctly so - that liberals are too couched in defeat, too busy watching ""Trading Spaces"" or reality TV, to voice their support.We have digested the last four years in pieces: Two dead today, insurgency last week, Dick Cheney's podium pounding tomorrow. In tiny bites, the crucible isn't tasty, but it is manageble. ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is the big, full-mouthed gulp and chew - the completed, grotesque puzzle when the footage is spliced together. The editing and juxtaposition of the film is overwhelming. A member of Moore's team, Jeff Gibbs, overlaps ""The Roof Is On Fire"" over shots of dead Iraqi children. In another scene, soliders touch the genitals of Iraqi prisoners. In a third, Marines raid a suburban Iraqi home while the family, gripped with fear, screams in vain.In its most powerful segment, Moore returns to Flint to interview Lila Lipscomb, whose son dies in Iraq. Lipscomb is waking up to the realities of this war - she originally describes herself as a ""conservative democrat"" - and when she is challenged by a Republican in Washington D.C., Lipscomb brings the debate to a halt. She bawls and rages in front of the White House, and you'd like to look away for privacy's sake. But you can't. Lipscomb personifies a growing, virulent anger in previously silent Americans tired of the dismissive attitude of the esblishment and their many so-called ""patriotic"" supporters.Is it propaganda? In portions where Moore depicts Bush as bumbling, crooked fool, yes, although Bush's own words do more than half the work. The pipeline theory is the stuff of Internet Web Blogs. Moore attempts to tie cutbacks in the Oregon State Patrol And yet - the Bush administration doesn't cuddle to any detractor. It pursues its agenda with zeal and force, and has an army of radio and television commentators working the trenches while Bush shakes hands and gives cabinet members pet names.  It takes a certain kind of energy and critical eye to counteract that machine, and Moore - not the networks, nor the editorial pages - has it.He takes his movie to the streets, and though his facts and melding of footage may occasionally present a blurry line, let's not kid ourselves: The lines have been forever blurred, and gentleman truths no longer prevail. For better or worse, the dueling voices Bill O'Reilly and Michael Moore are the future. In such partisan times, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" puts the ball back in the conservative court.

That means that I watch BOTH CNN and Fox News, and I listen to BOTH local AM radio and NPR.  Apparently, I am in the minority, as most Americans seem to want to listen to only the people who support their existing viewpoint.At the time this film came out, I looked desparately for a detractor who had ACTUALLY seen it.  Much to my chagrin, even John McCain, my favorite national politician (at least until he started serving as water-boy for the Bush re-election campaign), dissed the film without having even seen it.As a piece of film (for which it is rarely judged), this is a very well put together - with a nice contrast between the comic and the tragic.As a political commentary and indictment of the Bush administration, there is a whole lot of stuff that I took with the requisite grain of salt.  First of all, the fact that only one officer patrols the entire coast of Oregon is not only not within the jurisdiction of the federal government, but is not really that significant.  Secondly, I do not really think that the Bush-Bin Laden family connection, and financial gain to be had from a war on terrorism, inhibited the administration from stopping 9/11, as is implied by parts of the film.  The problem I have with conspiracy theories is that they assume a level of competency that is probably not there.Ultimately, however, I believe that there are parts of this film that are effectively indisputable and ultimately cemented my opposition to the Bush administration.  The most telling part of the film is the footage of Bush, continuing in his photo op with grade school children, for several minutes after being told the U.S. was under attach.  Just watch the blank stare of a deer in the headlights, without Moore's commentary, and tell me that this is the guy you want to be the next president.  It says alot about the true nature of his character and the tremendous influence of his handlers that he did not get up, right then and there, and do SOMETHING.  We already knew from the 2000 election that this guy was no Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, FDR, or Reagan, but that footage (conspicuously absent at the time 9/11 occured) has convinced me that this has got to stop.

630228,A2PN7Z2VTHICL8,B00005JNEI,"Schtinky ""Schtinky""","[8, 12]","I avoided this documentary for quite some time, particularly due to all the hype over how powerful it was, and from other voices how lame it was.  Well, I finally watched it to discover that I found it to be neither overly powerful or overly lame, but a fairly normal documentary put together much like others, focusing on the Bush family.Ignoring the Republican/Democrat verbal boxing matches (lets face it folks, there is no discerning the two parties apart any longer, all we have are Republicrats) this documentary did actually have some information that all Americans, regardless of partisanship, should have knowledge of.Most important, in my opinion, are the Bush/Cheney ties to the Bin Laden family.  Perhaps it is true that they have cut off their black-sheep son Osama, but there was no reason to personally, and at tax-payer expense, fly Bin Laden family members out of the United States before the public caught wind of their presence.Also, a personal opinion, is that there should not be that much camaraderie between supposedly ""competitive"" oil sources, meaning American/Eastern oil sources.  If this high-level billionaire club competed more than co-joined, I believe we *might* see lower prices.  No promises though.  But it does seem like a horrible friendship to keep during wartime, which is what makes Moore's presentation of ""hand-shaking"" Bush/Bin Laden pics so funny when presented to the tune of 'Shiny Happy Faces'.  That was a nice touch.But the Bush's (both SR and Bubba) oil connections to the Bin Laden's should, IMHO, have been made available to the public long before any elections were held.  Plus, the tie in with the powerful Carlyle Group and their connections to Bush, Bin Laden, Cheney, and the new Middle Eastern Oil Pipeline project (a major project never covered by the media in the USA) should be of interest to everyone.  And, not to surprise anyone, but also Enron's Ken Lay's involvement.To me, I found the most humiliating moment of this documentary to be when President Bush addressed attendees of one his high priced political dinners, referring to him and those present as the ""Haves"" and ""Have Mores"".  How smug of a statement to make at an elite mixer while it is the ""Have Nots"" who are dying in his war.  This was the one piece of text, that, IMHO, makes this DVD worth a rent and a watch.  Unbelievable in its arrogance.The other alarming item I find with the new Republicrats is that, during the Clinton administration, millions of people died in the 1994 Rwanda Genocide, which was/would have been, a virtuous cause to aid a foreign country; but in the next administration outright war is declared on a country that was unproven to have executed the terrorism, the families of the terrorists were freed, and war was declared against a country that needed much less of our aid than Rwanda, all because they happen to have oil underneath their land.  Would that Rwanda have had oil, or some commodity to interest the 1%-Extreme-Wealth of our planet Earth, perhaps not so many would have died.Again, just my two cents.  I believe this film is worth watching as a documentary on war politics (not just Bush or Republican but Past, Present, Future Republicrats) to inform yourself of the behind the scenes schemes of the wealthy and some heart-breaking reality's of the ""Have Nots"" who never made it to Bubba's little dinner party.

630234,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,B00005JNEI,Shashank Tripathi,"[17, 22]","Moore turns up the volume in this relentless assault on President Bush, but when we get past his overt bias, and the fact that a film of this cadre has been allowed to play in the first place during a reign that he denounces with such vitriol, we recognize that F-9/11 does have a lot to offer.His antics (such as reading the Patriot Act over a loudspeaker from an ice cream truck outside the White House) are as funny as ever, and some of his questions (why exactly WAS a Taliban official in Dallas in 2001 anyway) really do merit consideration.Even the most staunch critics of this film's message and ideology will have to admit that Moore did his homework this time around. Unlike BFC, even if the chronology of the footage in this context was altered, it would still be equally incriminating. The film is a blistering indictment chock full of factual information (service records, taped interviews, real video footage) that cannot be categorically labeled as false.My gripes have more to do with some narrative decisions:(1) We spend a lot of time showing Bush and Company combing their hair and primping for TV. Doesn't everyone undergo similar preparation before going on air? The sequence is of no real value to the film and inflates the running time by several wasted minutes, especially when a single frame of preening is repeated over and over again.(2) Seems a little unfair to rope in a teen popstar to support the idea. She's a kid and for what it is worth, I believe she handled an unexpected question that was clearly out of her league rather graciously.(3) The episode asking senators to sign their kids up for war was a bit messy. If you were a senator and had a documentary film producer walk up to you with an application form and a TV crew, would you say, ""Gee since this may be in public view, and since you are such an important and appropriately authorized person for this job, here, let me sign up my daughter to be shipped to Iraq""? Can't see what the idea behind this was, especially because the senator says that he HIMSELF was in the navy.(4) The scenes at the end with a bereaved woman are a bit drawn out (even if moving at first) and seemed to blame the Republicans for sending her son to war. This to me comes across as self-contradictory as the woman herself had said earlier that army was a good workaround lifestyle for people in her impoverished town. When one signs up for war, isn't he expected to know what it entails? Sounds a bit convenient to want the best of both worlds.Anyway, these are minor gripes in comparison to the bigger picture that the film addresses.You may agree or disagree with its assertions, question/deride the validity of its arguments, or use it as a point of reference, but at the very least Fahrenheit 9/11 hits all the right nerves. Some of the footage from US blanket bombing (oops, precision bombing) of Iraq is gutwrenching.A movie I highly recommend regardless of your political or ideological stance, if only for the perspective of the innocent being maimed in a land that posed or poses no threat to the US, even if they have WMDs hidden somewhere deep in the bowels of their natural oil fields.",4,"HERE'S A REVIEW OF THE FILM, FOR A CHANGE",1095465600,"09 18, 2004",2004,3167,"['Moore', 'up', 'volume', 'relentless', 'assault', 'President', 'Bush', 'when', 'get', 'overt', 'bias', 'fact', 'film', 'cadre', 'been', 'allowed', 'play', 'first', 'place', 'reign', 'such', 'vitriol', 'recognize', 'F-9/11', 'have', 'lot', 'offer.His', 'antics', 'such', 'reading', 'Patriot', 'Act', 'loudspeaker', 'ice', 'cream', 'truck', 'White', 'House', 'are', 'as', 'funny', 'ever', 'questions', 'why', 'exactly', 'Taliban', 'official', 'Dallas', '2001', 'anyway', 'really', 'do', 'merit', 'consideration.Even', 'most', 'staunch', 'critics', 'film', 'message', 'ideology', 'will', 'have', 'admit', 'Moore', 'did', 'homework', 'time', 'around', 'BFC', 'even', 'chronology', 'footage', 'context', 'was', 'altered', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'equally', 'incriminating', 'film', 'blistering', 'indictment', 'chock', 'full', 'factual', 'information', 'service', 'records', 'taped', 'interviews', 'real', 'video', 'footage', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'categorically', 'labeled', 'false.My', 'gripes', 'have', 'more', 'do', 'narrative', 'decisions', '1', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'showing', 'Bush', 'Company', 'combing', 'hair', 'primping', 'TV', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'undergo', 'similar', 'preparation', 'going', 'air', 'sequence', 'real', 'value', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'several', 'wasted', 'minutes', 'especially', 'when', 'single', 'frame', 'preening', 'repeated', 'over', 'again', '2', 'little', 'unfair', 'rope', 'teen', 'popstar', 'support', 'idea', 'kid', 'what', 'worth', 'believe', 'handled', 'unexpected', 'question', 'was', 'clearly', 'league', 'rather', 'graciously', '3', 'episode', 'asking', 'senators', 'sign', 'kids', 'up', 'war', 'was', 'bit', 'messy', 'were', 'senator', 'had', 'documentary', 'film', 'producer', 'walk', 'application', 'form', 'TV', 'crew', 'would', 'say', 'Gee', 'may', 'be', 'public', 'view', 'are', 'such', 'important', 'appropriately', 'authorized', 'person', 'job', 'here', 'let', 'sign', 'up', 'daughter', 'be', 'shipped', 'Iraq', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'idea', 'was', 'especially', 'senator', 'HIMSELF', 'was', 'navy', '4', 'scenes', 'end', 'bereaved', 'woman', 'are', 'bit', 'drawn', 'out', 'even', 'moving', 'first', 'seemed', 'blame', 'Republicans', 'sending', 'son', 'war', 'as', 'self-contradictory', 'woman', 'had', 'said', 'earlier', 'army', 'was', 'good', 'workaround', 'lifestyle', 'people', 'impoverished', 'town', 'When', 'one', 'signs', 'war', ""n't"", 'expected', 'know', 'what', 'bit', 'convenient', 'want', 'best', 'worlds.Anyway', 'are', 'minor', 'gripes', 'comparison', 'bigger', 'picture', 'film', 'addresses.You', 'may', 'agree', 'disagree', 'assertions', 'validity', 'arguments', 'use', 'point', 'reference', 'very', 'least', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'hits', 'right', 'nerves', 'footage', 'US', 'blanket', 'bombing', 'oops', 'precision', 'bombing', 'Iraq', 'gutwrenching.A', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'regardless', 'political', 'ideological', 'stance', 'only', 'perspective', 'innocent', 'being', 'maimed', 'land', 'posed', 'threat', 'US', 'even', 'have', 'WMDs', 'hidden', 'somewhere', 'deep', 'bowels', 'natural', 'oil', 'fields']",Fahrenheit 9/11

630238,ABE14SVILZLNY,B00005JNEI,"SID ""Punk""","[23, 27]","I can't really describe in words what I have in mind right now after seeing this beautiful documentary by Michael Moore. I find it very brave for a filmmaker to go and do such a good job in a documentary that might cost them their own life in a country that claims having freedom above all. I also find it great how Moore manages and expresses his own point of view, while others criticize him for having one. I guess many people cannot handle the truth especially now days. Many of those who criticize this filmmaker's point of view should consider thinking about this movie with an open mind. Just focus on the subject and forget how much you agree or disagree with Moore. How about this film as a documentary? Is it good? Is it bad? So how bad is it? Actually I might disagree about some of the points raised by this movie but that's deep inside my head and it was meant to be raised. You're free to think. It's actually much better if we do think. And to tell you the truth, my life was shocked few hours ago and this shock still affecting me.Ignoring the technical details in my review for now and focusing on the emotional side I got. This documentary kept me interested minute by minute and second by second. I loved the way music was used. I also noticed something else about me there in the dark room (cinema theatre that is), and what I noticed was being touched as a human much more than focusing on the technical stuff as an amateur movie critic. I guess the beauty about Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004) is that it was meant to make us think, feel, raise questions, and mostly know (or get closer to) the truth in a positive way that might change your life.Sometimes it is political and sometimes comic. It's even sentimental few times, but thought provoking after all and trying to stay as close to the absolute real truth as possible. Reminded me of Oliver Stone's daring, brave, great masterpiece that is JFK (1991) in many ways.

Bush, Bush's buddies in Saudi Arabia, and the massive corporations benefiting from the tragic war in Iraq.But it's not just the corporations, Saudis and Republicans that Moore criticizes.  It becomes obvious early on that he's sick of Democrats rolling over and doing nothing whenever their Conservative counterparts break yet another law.Fahrenheit 9/11 is patriotic, brave, controversial and essential viewing for anyone who loves their country and world.  Michael Moore exposes truths that have been hidden in alternative print media, underground books, and FSTV (Free Speech TV), for far too long.If you're an avid follower of ""alternative"" news, nothing much about Fahrenheit 9/11 will surprise you.  What will blow you away is the incredible job Michael Moore did piecing it all together for a two hour film.A couple of things are edited for time.  Moore almost entirely ignores George Bush's British lapdog, Tony Blair.  Blair has been nearly as bad as Bush in this corporate conspiracy for oil.  There is one fun poke at Blair, but Moore's obviously focusing more on the leader than the pathetic follower Tony has turned into.There is more than enough incriminating evidence in this film to impeach George W. Bush three times over.  The Neocons have it confused, in all their complaints regarding this film:  Michael Moore didn't make Bush appear to be impeachable; George W. Bush IS impeachable.Michael Moore didn't lie about WMDs.Michael Moore didn't order attacks on innocent civilians.Michael Moore didn't sign the ""Patriot"" Act.Michael Moore didn't commit war crimes.Michael Moore didn't cut taxes for the rich.Michael Moore didn't trade America's youth for cheap oil.Michael Moore didn't exploit people's fears.All Michael Moore did was capture what George W. Bush did.  For that, Mr. Moore should be commended -- not criticizedThis isn't the Michael Moore you remember from the groundbreaking Roger & Me or the Academy Award winning Bowling for Columbine.  There is humor in this picture, but it's sprinkled in with so much sadness and gloom, you can only force a laugh as a form of release.Fahrenheit 9/11 is no flash in the pan.  Moviegoers won't forget what they witnessed during the two hours they spent in the theater.  The revolution has begun.  Brought to us courtesy of one filmmaker with the nerve to ask, ""Why?""Moore's revelations will trickle down upon the masses.  And then the questions will begin.  Why are innocent Americans dying?

I am just going to say first that I am not a Republican or a Democrat. I'm an independent. So when I saw this movie I came from an un-bias point of view. Rating a film is hard, esspecially a film like this, where there are so many counter-acting views. That said, when you really examine this film, it is certainly not a good as Bowling for Columbine or Roger and Me. The problem here is that Michael Moore, like most people, choses only on side to look at. Despite what Pro-Gun people said about Bowling for Columbine, that was a very important and well done documentery about guns and their influnce on our culture. Not that the film didn't have its flaws, but really, what film doesn't. When it comes to this movie, though, Moore seems to have already chosen what the movie would support and what the movie would denouce. What I think he should have done, and this is just my opinion, is to have examine both sides of the issue over Iraq, homeland security, the 2000 election, etc. When it came to Iraq, he forgot that the only reason it was really a soverign nation was because Saddam Hussien chose to make ""his country"" a soverign nation. When it came to homeland sercurity, he only showed us only one place where there is a problem with homeland security, expecting us to think that all homeland security is just as bad. It is in poor condition, but that doesn't mean that you should only focus on the negitive. His issue with the disenfranchisment of more than serveral thousand African-Americans was a much stronger point, considering the substancial evidence. The problem with that is usually it's the groups who are incharge of trying to elect the President who do that sort of dirty work, the same ones who stuffed the Chicago ballot boxes for JFK. They would probably not involve a canidate when it comes to illegal tactics like that, because then the President could say that he had no knowlege of such activities. I could be wrong, but I think that what they did because that is an old polictical technique. All in all, this movie didn't really examine the entire picture, chosing only to focus on certain things. I think Michael Moore should remember, you don't really know other people untill you've walked a mile in their shoes.

I used to think Michael Moore was a big fat, disgustiung ogre who had a chip on his shoulder against President Bush.  Watching him up there on the stage at the Oscars giving his acceptance speech in 2003 enraged me at the time. But one year after the Iraq war, things started coming unraveled that would change my faith in the GOP and give this movie an honest look.More and more, I started hearing about bad intelligence.  One was the fact that Iraq had ""NO"" weapons of mass destruction, as alleged by the Bush Administration.  Intelligence made up by the CIA had us believing Hussein was manufacturing Uranium in the African country of Niger.  That intelligence was rebuked by PBS's Frontline story, ""The Dark Side"" and lead to the outing of CIA agent, Valerie Plame by Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, L. ""Scooter"" Libby.  Another was the fact that the Patriot Act was ""NEVER"" scrutinized when it was passed.  This was information I already knew prior to watching this film.  Democrats never stood up and questioned the blatant violation of the First Ammendment for fear of being, ""Unpatriotic"".  But what put me over the edge was the fact that Saddam Hussein was made a scapegoat to coverup the Bin-Laden/Bush linkage.I sincerely wonder if the Administration knew about 9/11 and did nothing to stop it.  There are so many questions that Michael Moore asked in this film that were never asked by the mainstream press (FOX, CNN,NBC, ABC, CBS). That leads me to believe that either Americans are dumb or just plain stupid for not questioning anything.  Judging from the results of the 2004 election, Americans have only themselves to blame for this debacle for not getting rid of the problem.  Me included!Whatever your feelings on Michael Moore, you owe it to yourself to watch this film.  Take the name ""Moore"" out of the mix and imagine it was made by someone else.  At least get both sides of the story and make a honest judgement on President George W. Bush and his decisions.",5,"""Fool Me Once, Shame On You!

Given the preponderant ideological direction of much mainstream, especially US, media, that's no bad thing. But it is indeed hit and miss. I found it hard to work out much outrage about the cosiness of the Bushes with the Saudis being a matter of concern, not just in the general way cosiness of American leaders with plenty regimes around the place with shocking human rights records is, but specifically because many of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudis. Without further argument, that seems beside the point, given that we know Al Qaeda would love nothing more than to overthrow the Saudi government. And we're far from above Moore's often irritating love of silly gimmicks. Reading the Patriot Act to Congress from a megaphone on a van outside didn't really get us very far. Nor did the silly asking congressmen to enlist their kids gimmick. (I think the US is still enough of a free country that it's left up to kids to enlist themselves and their parents can't do it for them.)So much for the prosecution. If that was the stuff to dislike there was plenty to like. Lila Lipscombe's account of her soldier son's death was extremely moving. Footage of a US soldier describing how they went into battle to the strains of Bloodhound Gang's `Fire Water Burn'  was intensely disturbing. Britney Spears was, oh dear, well, as the credits might say, herself. And Bush. Well, here there's really no answer to Moore's case. When Senator Kerry tells you Bush is costing you respect overseas, my dear American friends, do please believe him. Over in Europe we are scratching our heads trying to figure out how such a great country ever came to elect (well, ok, in a manner of speaking, elect) such an outrageous moral and intellectual pygmy as its leader.

Thomas JeffersonNo better example currently on DVD can be found proving Jefferson's timeless truth.  It is not the opinions or interpretations by Moore that his vociferous (compensating with volume for what they lack in numbers) detractors have a problem with, it is his undoing of millions of dollars worth of corporate propaganda and censorship by his exposition of facts.  ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is the original ""inconvenient truth"", inconveniencing right-wingers, a complicit media, and derelict journalists alike with a litany of non-repudiated inconvenient facts such as: the billions of dollars of Saudi investments in American real estate and business and Bush's cozy relationship with some of those investors, the Saudi billionaire bin Laden family and the supposed black-sheep member of their family, anti-Russian-CIA-operative Osama, who strangely offered his assistance against Saddam Hussein when the latter threatened Saudi oil by invading Kuwait, the many bizarre and now notorious events preceding and following 9/11, etc, etc.The corporate media monopoly takes a major hit by Moore's exposure of facts they deliberately excluded, as does the post 9/11 reality they had created for mass consumption.  How does Moore's famous video-clip of Bush staring like a deer trapped in a hunter's headlights after being informed of the second plane crashing into the World Trade Center gel with the media's heroic portrayal of the Great Leader, arm draped around a battle-weary firefighter, shouting soundbites from the 9/11 rubble?

To see and hear facts, stats, and pictures that you have never, yet, seen or heard in the mainstream media, no matter how often they repeat the lie about their being liberal.  Whether you agree with Moore's often-implied opinions and interpretations of those facts is irrelevant.  (I, e.g., think too much was made over Bush's strange, possibly suspicious, stupefied stare.  However, in a country with a free press it would have received much media coverage.  Like most of the material in the movie, I had never seen it or heard about it before this movie!)Many people, of course, don't deserve to have a democracy and avoid the truth because, as Jack Nicholson famously memorialized to Tom Cruise (portraying military prosecutor Iglesias): ""You can't handle the truth!""And many are thankful that they have corporate media lackeys to protect them from the truth.

630253,A2VP7JOT3K7PFM,B00005JNEI,"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie""","[7, 20]","+++++This movie documentary that was written, produced, and directed by Michael Moore looks at the role played by money and oil after the tragic events of September 11, 2001.  The majority of the movie contains archival news footage with Moore narrating but there are some interviews.  This is balanced with Moore's own brand of humor and satire.It's title comes from the 1953 novel entitled ""Fahrenheit 451"" that depicts a society where independent thinking is discouraged and books are burned.  (451 degrees Fahrenheit is the temperature that's needed for paper to burn.)This movie was written and released just before George W. Bush's re-election in 2004 as president of the United States.The end credits of this documentary reveal who it is dedicated too:""This film is dedicated to...all the soldiers from the Flint [Michigan] area who have died in the Iraq war...the 2,973 who died on 9/11/01 and the countless thousands who have died in Afghanistan and Iraq as a result of our [that is, the American government's] actions.""As a very brief overview, this movie begins with the strange events that occurred during the 2000 election between Gore and Bush.  Then we hear and see the horrors of September 11, 2001 and the president's response to these horrors.  From here, the documentary tells and shows us key things with respect to the Afghanistan war and the Iraq war.  The movie ends with a ""Congressional Recruitment"" by Moore.Moore also has some candid interviews in the movie.  Most revealing is the interview with a serviceman that had recently returned from Iraq.  When asked if he'd return to Iraq if asked he said ""No"" even if this decision meant ""possible jail time.""  His reason:""I will not let anyone send me back over there to kill other poor people [e]specially when they pose no threat to me and my country...I won't do it.""As I mentioned above, the majority of this documentary contains archival news footage, some of it graphic.  Despite Moore's occasional narration, this footage speaks for itself.  (I found it helpful to turn on the English subtitles when viewing this movie.)Of all this footage, one thing stood out for me: when Bush referred to himself as the ""war president.""Who will you see or hear in this documentary?  I'm not going to list all the names but here are some:Michael Moore, George W. Bush, George Bush, Britney Spears, Ben Affleck, Colin Powell, Bill Clinton, Robert De Niro, Al Gore, John Ashcroft, Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden, Dan Rather, Donald Rumsfeld, Condoleeza Rice, Laura Bush.As a piece of filmmaking, I think Quentin Tarantino (who was the Cannes' president) said it best when this documentary won best picture at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival:""You [Michael Moore] won because we thought it was the best film that we saw.""(The above quotation was obtained from the first extra found on this DVD.)As the more than 1800 reviews below this one attest, you will either dislike (even hate) or like (even love) this movie.  But isn't this a sign of a good movie--to illicit strong emotion?Finally, the DVD itself is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has ten extras, all of which I found to be very interesting and informative.In conclusion, I urge you to see this movie documentary for yourself and discover why this was the ""first ever documentary to cross over the $100 million mark in the United States.""(2004;  2 hr;  widescreen;  28 scenes)+++++",5,A Documentary for all Citizens of the Free World!!!,1125878400,"09 5, 2005",2005,3411,"['+++++This', 'movie', 'documentary', 'was', 'written', 'produced', 'directed', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'role', 'played', 'money', 'oil', 'tragic', 'events', 'September', '11', '2001', 'majority', 'movie', 'archival', 'news', 'footage', 'Moore', 'narrating', 'are', 'interviews', 'balanced', 'Moore', 'own', 'brand', 'humor', 'satire.It', 'title', '1953', 'novel', 'entitled', 'Fahrenheit', '451', 'society', 'where', 'independent', 'thinking', 'discouraged', 'books', 'are', 'burned', '451', 'degrees', 'Fahrenheit', 'temperature', 'needed', 'paper', 'burn', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'released', 'just', 'before', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 're-election', '2004', 'president', 'United', 'States.The', 'end', 'credits', 'documentary', 'reveal', 'who', 'dedicated', 'too', 'film', 'dedicated', 'soldiers', 'Flint', '[', 'Michigan', ']', 'area', 'who', 'have', 'died', 'Iraq', 'war', '2,973', 'who', 'died', '9/11/01', 'countless', 'thousands', 'who', 'have', 'died', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'result', '[', 'American', 'government', ']', 'actions', 'very', 'brief', 'overview', 'movie', 'strange', 'events', 'occurred', '2000', 'election', 'Gore', 'Bush', 'Then', 'hear', 'see', 'horrors', 'September', '11', '2001', 'president', 'response', 'horrors', 'here', 'documentary', 'tells', 'key', 'things', 'respect', 'Afghanistan', 'war', 'Iraq', 'war', 'movie', 'Congressional', 'Recruitment', 'Moore.Moore', 'also', 'candid', 'interviews', 'movie', 'Most', 'revealing', 'interview', 'serviceman', 'had', 'recently', 'returned', 'Iraq', 'When', 'asked', ""'d"", 'return', 'Iraq', 'asked', 'said', 'No', 'even', 'decision', 'meant', 'possible', 'jail', 'time', 'reason', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'anyone', 'send', 'back', 'there', 'kill', 'other', 'poor', 'people', '[', 'e', ']', 'specially', 'when', 'pose', 'threat', 'country', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'mentioned', 'majority', 'documentary', 'contains', 'archival', 'news', 'footage', 'graphic', 'Moore', 'occasional', 'narration', 'footage', 'found', 'helpful', 'turn', 'English', 'subtitles', 'when', 'viewing', 'movie', 'footage', 'one', 'thing', 'stood', 'out', 'when', 'Bush', 'referred', 'war', 'president', 'Who', 'will', 'see', 'hear', 'documentary', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'list', 'names', 'here', 'are', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'George', 'Bush', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Colin', 'Powell', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Al', 'Gore', 'John', 'Ashcroft', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Laden', 'Dan', 'Rather', 'Donald', 'Rumsfeld', 'Condoleeza', 'Rice', 'Laura', 'Bush.As', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'think', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'who', 'was', 'Cannes', 'president', 'said', 'best', 'when', 'documentary', 'won', 'best', 'picture', '2004', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', '[', 'Michael', 'Moore', ']', 'won', 'thought', 'was', 'best', 'film', 'saw', 'above', 'quotation', 'was', 'obtained', 'first', 'extra', 'found', 'DVD', 'more', '1800', 'reviews', 'one', 'attest', 'will', 'either', 'dislike', 'even', 'hate', 'even', 'love', 'movie', ""n't"", 'sign', 'good', 'movie', 'illicit', 'strong', 'emotion', 'Finally', 'DVD', 'perfect', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'ten', 'extras', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'informative.In', 'conclusion', 'urge', 'see', 'movie', 'documentary', 'yourself', 'discover', 'why', 'was', 'first', 'ever', 'documentary', 'cross', '100', 'million', 'mark', 'United', 'States', '2004', '2', 'hr', '28', 'scenes', '+++++']",Fahrenheit 9/11

For a bunch of people so apparently resolute on spreading the joy of ""freedom"" throughout the world, it's odd to see conservatives getting so enraged when an American exercises a bit of it at home. Sure, you might disagree with Moore's views. Sure, you might accuse him of presenting only one side of the story. But go make your own movie. Isn't that what a free press is all about? I'm sure you won't have trouble getting financial backing or a distribution deal. Fox News runs equally biased, equally risible ""news"" every day. I rarely agree with most of what Moore says, but I adore the fact that he says it and the way he goes about the task. His work is both a consequence and a cause of a truly functional democracy. Look at what it's achieved - people are finally talking about the issues; they're wondering if what Moore says is true; they're doing their own research and making up their own minds. If the conservatives are right, then truth will out and they'll be justified - so what have they got to worry about? If the conservatives are lying, then truth will out - and they'll get what they deserve. That's the way it's meant to work, even in Florida. So what's the problem? Moore isn't anti-American, he's simply anti the abuse of power. For my money, that makes him a true patriot. Like Gore Vidal, Moore sees the difference between the American Republic, and the American Global Empire which is its most dangerous enemy - and until conservative Americans learn to separate the flag, the Presidency and moral righteousness, and see that unthinking worship of any one of them can be used as a smokescreen for the debasement of the others, then the fear of seeming ""unpatriotic"" will be used to frighten and manipulate Americans to whatever ends those in power choose. I'm simultaneously delighted and disgusted by the existence of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"": delighted that America is still a nation where a citizen can mount this kind of attack on the government and live to tell the tale, and disgusted that the Presidency has been dragged to such depths by the Bush-Cheney junta that a wildly accusatory film like this is needed as a corrective.

In the last four elections, however, my votes went to:  Nader (twice), Kerry and then Obama.  It's hard for me to imagine that history will not come to judge George W. Bush as our worst president ever.Be that as it may, I doubt that there have been many worse documentary film makers than Michael Moore.  To cite just one example from ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" there is a short clip  where Bush appears to be standing in the midst of a bunch of  fat cats, talking about his ""base"" (i.e., the ""haves and have-mores""); this clip was plucked, misleadingly, from a massive fundraising event/dinner put on by the Catholic Church in which both presidential candidates (Bush and Gore) were in attendance, and at which both poked a little fun at themselves for the purpose of giving these donors to Catholic charities a few very good laughs.  Moore's film cut made it look like Bush was SERIOUSLY pandering to this group.

630259,A3TEH90X39WC8F,B00005JNEI,"Stuart W. Mirsky ""swm""","[20, 67]","I watched this at the invitation of someone who insisted I do so, saying it would convince me Bush was a disaster for the country. What I saw, instead, were Moore's usual diatribes, cleverly constructed to misrepresent the truth. We all know Bush was inexperienced in facing the camera during his early years in office and highly self-conscious about it to boot, all of which tended to make him smirk foolishly at inopportune moments, stumble haltingly over his words and look beseechingly around, as though seeking approval. Often he would pause in mid-sentence, as though painfully aware that his enemies were all around him, waiting for him to blunder. The resultant linguistic hesitancy he evidenced inevitably made Bush blunders a nearly self-fulfilling prophecy.He came into office without a lot of seasoning and it showed, though he seems to have gained more poise as a result of his nearly four years in office under the relentless fire of a demonstrably partisan media and his equally partisan Democratic opponents. The result of his early lack of seasoning, of course, was that he provided the camera with plenty of footage that made him look and sound kind of dopey. Moore used whatever he could find of this footage, along with some of his own rather ingenious interviews and commentary, to construct a picture of Bush the fool, using innuendo and out-of-context shots to suggest corruption on Bush's part.So Moore makes the case that Bush is laughably stupid and, at the same time, cynically conspiratorial. Of course, if he is that stupid how much danger can he present to us as a cynical conspirator? He's either Bozo the Clown or Machiavelli, but he can't be both. (Moore gets around this conundrum by suggesting Bush is really the puppet of other, even more nefarious interests, including the infamous Carlyle Group, an investment company in which his father and James Baker, his father's crony, have interests, and, of course, those sneaky Saudis.)Adding a number of outright falsehoods for good measure (such as the claim that members of the bin Laden family were allowed to fly out of the U.S. unquestioned, when other planes were being grounded, immediately after 9/11 . . . definitively shown to be false), Moore shot a film that is highly entertaining but also demeaning to this nation and president. It's regrettable that he has such vitriol for his country or that he is unable to scope out a position of opposition based on fact and reasoned argument. But it's more regrettable that so many today have clambered on board his outrageous propaganda train and see nothing wrong with his distortions and misrepresentations and have even elevated him to a kind of cult icon. Lots of money in it for Moore, I guess, so he has, at the least, found himself another lucrative niche. But I'm sure the money isn't what interests him, right? He's in it for the betterment of society, isn't he, even if that means pushing the level of political discourse down into the gutter.Well, thankfully, this is all just about over and we'll soon know who the country wants as president for the next four years. Unfortunately the odds are that Michael Moore is unlikely to give up this particularly profitable niche.

The pathetic attempts to downplay this cinematic phenomenon are as transparent as the attempts to slander its director and as disingenuous as the administration that it exposes.  Of course, the film's political and social impact would not be possible if not for its artistic excellence.As for the charge of propaganda, I think John Berger addressed this quite eloquently in his recent article in the Guardian:""To denigrate this as propaganda is either naive or perverse, forgetting (deliberately?) what the last century taught us. Propaganda requires a permanent network of communication so that it can systematically stifle reflection with emotive or utopian slogans. Its pace is usually fast. Propaganda invariably serves the long-term interests of some elite.This single maverick movie is often reflectively slow and is not afraid of silence. It appeals to people to think for themselves and make connections. And it identifies with, and pleads for, those who are normally unlistened to. Making a strong case is not the same thing as saturating with propaganda. Fox TV does the latter; Michael Moore the former.""Like Bowling For Columbine, Fahrenheit 911 is alternately humorous and gut-wrenching.  We laugh at our inept and clownish president and then shudder at the consequences of his policies.  Moore hits hard with images of dead and critically wounded Iraqis.  One scene, in which a furious and indignant Iraqi man places a mutilated baby in the back of a corpse-filled pick-up and vows revenge, is particulary affecting.Moore also interviews a mother of an American soldier killed in Iraq.  She is disillusioned - lost.  ""Why?"" she asks.  It is the right question and one answered quite thoroughly by this movie.  Are you not curious?",5,"Propaganda?

Da current president.Michael Moore either doesnt understand or pretends not to, that the system under which the U.S functions does so despite of particular persons. Nothing much would change had Kerry for example been elected and to propagandise the opposite is actually naive and suspicious in itself. Capitalism, communism, whichever such system based on classes functions the way it does regardless of who's in power.The fact that this is ignored by Moore who launches a rather cheap offensive on Bush as if he is the critical part of the puzzle is enough to dismiss his film alltogether as populistic propaganda to be consumed only by the politically uneducated.If one thing impressed me about this film is that Moore does touch (at the beginning) some thorny issues only to suddenly leave them be and proceed making jokes about Bush being on vacation too much. But Moore and anybody for that matter would also be on frequent vacation if his agenda was going according to plan and if he wasn't really needed to begin with. And lastly, there are more facts being ignored on this film than the ones actually revealed.Moore is without a shred of a doubt a great entertainer as well as a very good filmmaker.

Bush, and goes out of his way to make him look bad in this film, but making him look bad doesn't seem to take much of an effort.The most amazing part of the movie was the film of the president sitting in a classroom, listening to kids read a story, when one of his aides told him the country was under attack.  He sat there for seven minutes, frozen, before getting up to do something about the attacks.We always hear about the ""liberal media"" in this country, but if the media is so liberal why didn't we ever see his failure to react to the news until this movie came out?  Obviously, there was no time to show this at the time, but why didn't the networks go back and show us this lack of reaction a month or two later?Anyway, if you haven't decided how you will vote you should watch this movie and it might help you decide.  A few of the points Moore makes in the film include:1.  There was no reason to go to war with Iraq.2.  Only one member of Congress has a child serving in Iraq.3.  Most of the soldiers are from poor areas like Flint, Michiganwhere there are no other jobs.4.  The Homeland Security Act makes very little sense.5.  The greed of companies like Haliburton is disturbing.  Theyare the big winners in this war.Of course if you back Bush, you'll say the film is totally biased and a waste of time, so you probably won't want to bother with it.

By caving into pressure from the right, Disney not only failed to honor Moore's right to free speech, but it also let a blockbuster smash slide through its fingers.  Is Moore an opportunist for deliberately releasing this movie during an election year?  Probably.  Is it biased?  Only a fool would say &quot;no.&quot;  But regardless of what side of the political fence you're on, &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; will arouse fierce debate, and its images will alarm, disturb and unnerve.  Not to mention that the movie is funny as hell.  The opening sequence outlines, with strong conviction, how the 2000 election was manipulated to portray Bush as the winner.  Other interesting clips are a ditzy Britney Spears blindly endorsing the president, evidence that links the Bush family to the bin Ladens, footage of Bush reading nursery rhymes to grade school kids for SEVEN MINUTES after he got word of the 9/11 attacks, as well as Moore vainly trying to persuade congressmen to get their children to enlist in the very Iraq war they endorsed.  But the heart of &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; rests in Lila Lipscomb.  Lila is a working class mother in Flint, MI, and is aggressively supportive of the war in Iraq until she learns that her son, a soldier, was killed in battle.  Witnessing her anguish onscreen (and in front of the White House where she vents her frustration and mourns the loss of her son) is truly heartbreaking.  Moore rocked several comfort zones during his infamous 2003 Oscar speech for his previous documentary &quot;Bowling for Columbine,&quot; and &quot;Fahrenheit&quot; will no doubt do more of the same.

This is a relatively tame indictment of Bush.  --If only Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter were so gentle with their targets.  Moore could have talked about the Wolfowitz Doctrine, about Prescott Bush's ties to the Nazi regime, about Guantanamo Bay and the mistreatment of prisoners by the U.S., about Rumsfeld's attempts to evade the Geneva Conventions.  And while Abu Grayb did not happen in time for the release of this documentary in theaters, it could have been a supplement on the DVD.What's more frustrating is how Moore often feels compelled to exaggerate for dramatic effect, when just telling the facts would be damning enough.  For example, he buries the fact that the planes of Saudi and bin Laden families were permitted to leave only on 9/13, when regular air travel resumed.  He shows what appears to be a newspaper headline saying Gore won the recount, when in fact this was a letter to the editor and not the official position of the paper.  He did a lot more of this sort of thing in his last film, Bowling for Columbine, than he does here; still, his reputation is so tarnished by it that many now choose not to believe him no matter what he says.  And this will give the Ann Coulters and Rush Limbaughs plenty of ammunition (as if they were bastions of factual purity!).And in this film he doesn't say as much that's shocking, if you keep up with current events from sources OTHER than the cable news whores.  Fahrenheit 9/11 tell us Bush is a twit.  Anyone who's ever seen his press conferences knows that.  It tells us the people around him lie their asses off.  Wow, ya think?  Some people may not have known about the cousin at Fox news who called Florida for him in the 2000 elections, or seen the video of the egg-peltings at the inauguration.  (Funny how little the ""independent"" American media reported that.)  The story of the Oregon border patrol was great; the story of Lila Lipscomb was not.  In fact, it felt a little like a cheap shot.  How would one EXPECT a monther who's been through what she's been through to react?

630277,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B00005JNEI,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[5, 8]","I am not sure where to start with this movie, or this persuasive visually essay. After all, that is what it is. Anyone who states this movie is entire fact, despite political stripe, is really not being honest with himself or herself. Many of Michael Moore's arguments and positions on topics really follow a ""1 + 1 = 3"" formula. For instance Fahrenheit 9/11 opens with the Bush/Gore 2000 election. How different news channels weren't displaying solidarity with the results of the election. Then the film states how Bush stole Florida from Gore. How did Bush do this? Well his brother Jeb was the governor at the time, which is how! Now I am not saying that isn't shady, and I was living in Florida and voted in that election, I recall how crazy that entire process was. But you know how this entire situation could have been avoided? If Al Gore won Tennessee (his home state) and Arkansas (President Bill Clinton's home state, after all Gore worked with him for eight years). Had Gore won these states, he wouldn't have had to worry about Florida! Nevertheless, jolly old Michael Moore omits these types of facts throughout the entire film. I know many people on the right side of the fence were upset with this movie and feel it shouldn't have been made. My response to that notion is ""If you are that upset GOP, make your own movie.""As for President George W. Bush, I have a question. Is he the dumbest kid on the street or is he the devil himself? Because I find myself getting really confused, I am not sure how he can be both. I imagine someone who is really evil to be very intelligent, not to be stupid. Consequently, President Bush seems to be both, as ominous as Hitler, but as dumb as Porky Pig. I am confused, but I think that is the ruse behind Moore's mix message in this movie.I want it to be understood I don't think Bush is the brightest crayon in the box, but I don't think the fault of the world is his pratfall. It just isn't one person who makes decisions in government; any college level course will explain that information to you. There are many shadowy and dark figures in American politics that are both Republican and Democrat. These factors fall into every element of contemporary America.As for 9/11 itself, what a terrible thing to happen to any country, the fact it happened in New York City was unspeakable. I am able to say I had been to the WTC before and after the attack. Seeing the aftermath was quite moving, to think one of the greatest cites in the world became a target of hate and pain. As for the human-interest story about the solider that was killed and his mother coping, was touching. However, what about every soldier's family who had to deal with a death related to the War on Terror? Not just in this current war, but in every war that was ever fought? The bloody shirt technique was both moving and a low blow all at the same time. As I write this, I feel conflicted, but please remember that movie making has the magic of editing. Was that mother's pain fake, no? Was her son not a hero, of course he was. But every war has a casualty, which is why it is war. And for every mother, who is upset her son/daughter is involved with this war, there is another mother/father who is pleased her son/daughter is defending the United States. I think Michael Moore should have selected more than one family for his visually diatribe, what do you think?I suppose I understand Moore's plan, blame people here in the United States because after all if Al Gore were president we wouldn't have terrorists, right? If Al Gore were president we would all have better public schools, lower taxes and no crime, right?  Finally, if Al Gore were president there would be no plot against the United States, United Kingdom and other countries, in regards to blowing up public airlines? Right? Remember that the WTC was attacked back in 1993 by terrorists, when Bill Clinton was President. Just some food for thought.In modern times, we as a country should stand together and be a democracy, blaming each other and falling apart is giving terrorists what they want.  Especially with all the horror going on with issues around the world today. My greatest concern is this; once Bush is out of office are we still going to be blaming him? Or are we going to be moving forward? There are still some hard core GOP members who still hate Bill Clinton for things that are wrong in this country. Come on people.In conclusion, the moral of the story is don't believe everything you see on TV. This movie should be an inspiration for people everywhere to tap into their critical thinking skills. The problem with this country isn't Bush, Michael Moore or the War in the Middle East. It is that fact that more people are involved in voting for the next American Idol, not the next American President.",2,The magic of Moore,1155168000,"08 10, 2006",2006,4818,"['am', 'not', 'sure',

For example, the 7 minutes of Bush sitting there reading a book about Goats after the second plane struck the WTC is not as compelling on film as I had expected.On the other hand, I agree with everything said in this film (except how unemployment is calculated) and I think a lot of it just needs to be said.  I don't think that Bush and Bin Laden conspired to wage war exactly and Moore doesn't say this, but the family ties between the Bushes and the Saudis is a story that has been ignored for the most part by the mainstream press.I really liked the ending and his conclusion that perhaps war is being waged as a way of suppressing the lower classes, how the lower class produces the people willing to fight to preserve the property and freedoms of the upper class.

630280,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B00005JNEI,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[31, 38]","I couldn't wait to see this so, despite having to work awfully early the morning after the opening night, I got in line. The film was supposed to start, I thought, at 9:30. At 9:10 there were already about 60 in line, though, I found out, it was scheduled to start at 9:50. By then, the line was all around the block, and this in a small, relatively convervative community!First, for those all hurt inside (sniff, sniff) that Moore criticized poor George, so what? He made no claims to the contrary. From the very beginning, he said that's what he planned on doing! It's an anti-Bush film, for crying out loud!And for those challenged by the film's role as a ""documentary,"" I say the same I did for those who challenged the ""truth"" to ""Bowling for Columbine."" ""Documentary"" is a misnomer. It's an op-ed piece--or ""polemic"" as an academically inclined colleague calls it. And I've been saying that for longer than Moore has!Sure it's propoganda, like a colleague screams. But, as an article I liked said, ""So is the front page.""True, it's an entertaining film. I didn't laugh as hard as I did as in a few scenes in ""Bowling."" But nor did I shed as many a tear---though I might have for those many who're being perverted by the excuse for a ""war"" in the Mideast. Toward the beginning, Moore mentions the time Dubya has spent on vacation. Bushies are insulted by that? If I were to attempt the same, I'd be on a street corner with a cup!The scene with John Ashcroft singing his song--right before the comment that he ran against a dead guy and the dead guy won shortly before Dubya appointed him attorney general--had me in stitches. And Moore renting an ice cream truck to read the Patriot Act to Congress--who apparently hadn't bothered to read it before they enacted it--was a gem. But the consequences of that act--surveillance of obviously innocent people for innocuous comments about Bush--now that's not so amusing.There's some ""conspiracy theory"" for which the film is criticized. Well, how seriously do you take any conspiracy theory? And, if the Bushes have nothing to defend themselves against, then let 'em say that.Most important, the film DID evoke some questions. Hmm...how much money are the Bushes making off the Saudis? I have been inclined to challenge hawks, particularly young ones. If you're so behind the war, then why aren't you at the recruiter now? So, why is there ONE congressperson with a son in Iraq?I'm most amazed, I guess, at where Moore got some of his film clips. One that comes to mind right off is when Dubya was speaking to a room full of people, all of them in tuxedoes. He proclaims that ""Some call you the elite. I call you my base."" And they all laugh. Sorry, but I don't find that funny. That's dangerous, a sample of Bush's economic mindset, and the source of his economic advice.And the observation that it's the poorer among us who're being recruited into the military (from which nearly all of the Bush administration escaped conveniently during the Vietnam era) has been true at least since Vietnam, maybe even moreso now.Nearly all the criticism I hear of the film is either extraneous, irrelevant, or from those who haven't seen it. Even a conservative colleague--who liked ""Bowling"" for the same reasons I did--admitted that too many of her peers criticize a film without seeing it.If you don't like Moore, or think he ""hates America"" or other choice platitudes, then don't go see the film.

630286,A3EJVZ5LCBP61X,B00005JNEI,"TOMMY C ELLIS ""Prison Rev.""","[10, 16]","Did George W. Bush allow his business relationships with the Bin Laden family to dictate American foreign policy?  Did he intentionally lie about the weapons of mass destruction being in Iraq?  Is the whole 9/11 response in Afghanistan and Iraq really an elaborate scheme of the President to create favorable business for his wealthy business acquaintences?  Is Bush in the pocket of Saudi investors?  And the bottom line question:  is the current war in Iraq without purpose?Those inclined to distrust Bush will love this work, and grant a quick five stars for its collage of facts, emotions, and righteous indignation, combined with winning sarcasm.  The few remaining neo-conservative partisans will trash this as a psuedo-documentary that traffics in wild conspiracy theories, and which treats with childish disrespect a very serious war and terrorist threat.  Furthermore, they will decry as unfair this very deliberate hatchet job on Bush.My own bias is that Bush went into Iraq hoping to plant a beach head for democracy in the Middle East.  The war has proven far deadlier and muckier than expected, but hopefully a stable government can still be erected in that suffering land.As for this work, it is decent.  As a propaganda piece, the war mom's conversion was powerful, and impossible to ignore--probably the highlight of the show.  On the other hand, even with this winning segment, I constantly felt that Moore was using everyone he encountered.  Additionally, some of the scenes were sophomoric, such as the director riding around D.C. in a truck, reading the Patriot Act through a megaphone.  His effort to recruit congressional members to enlist their children in the military also came across more as peevishness than serious commentary.Bottom-line:  Anti-War activists should buy this movie and watch it weekly--perhaps on Sunday mornings, after singing Kum By Ya with friends.  Die-hard Bush fans should avoid this like the plague.  Those with ambivalence--probably the vast majority--will find this an uneven, but ultimately intriguing film.",3,"Political hit piece that is intriguing, yet at times childish and obscure",1126483200,"09 12, 2005",2005,2061,"['Did', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'allow', 'business', 'relationships', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'family', 'dictate', 'American', 'foreign', 'policy', 'Did', 'intentionally', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'being', 'Iraq', 'whole', '9/11', 'response', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'really', 'elaborate', 'scheme', 'President', 'create', 'favorable', 'business', 'wealthy', 'business', 'acquaintences', 'Bush', 'pocket', 'Saudi', 'investors', 'bottom', 'line', 'question', 'current', 'war', 'Iraq', 'purpose', 'inclined', 'distrust', 'Bush', 'will', 'love', 'work', 'grant', 'quick', 'five', 'stars', 'collage', 'facts', 'emotions', 'righteous', 'indignation', 'combined', 'winning', 'sarcasm', 'few', 'remaining', 'neo-conservative', 'partisans', 'will', 'trash', 'psuedo-documentary', 'traffics', 'wild', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'childish', 'disrespect', 'very', 'serious', 'war', 'terrorist', 'threat', 'Furthermore', 'will', 'decry', 'unfair', 'very', 'deliberate', 'hatchet', 'job', 'Bush.My', 'own', 'bias', 'Bush', 'went', 'Iraq', 'hoping', 'plant', 'beach', 'head', 'democracy', 'Middle', 'East', 'war', 'proven', 'far', 'deadlier', 'muckier', 'expected', 'hopefully', 'stable', 'government', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'erected', 'suffering', 'land.As', 'work', 'decent', 'propaganda', 'piece', 'war', 'mom', 'conversion', 'was', 'powerful', 'impossible', 'ignore', 'probably', 'highlight', 'show', 'other', 'hand', 'even', 'winning', 'segment', 'constantly', 'felt', 'Moore', 'was', 'using', 'everyone', 'encountered', 'Additionally', 'scenes', 'were', 'sophomoric', 'such', 'director', 'riding', 'around', 'D.C.', 'truck', 'reading', 'Patriot', 'Act', 'megaphone', 'effort', 'recruit', 'congressional', 'members', 'enlist', 'children', 'military', 'also', 'came', 'across', 'more', 'peevishness', 'serious', 'commentary.Bottom-line', 'Anti-War', 'activists', 'should', 'buy', 'movie', 'watch', 'weekly', 'perhaps', 'Sunday', 'mornings', 'singing', 'Kum', 'Ya', 'friends', 'Die-hard', 'Bush', 'fans', 'should', 'avoid', 'plague', 'ambivalence', 'probably', 'vast', 'majority', 'will', 'find', 'uneven', 'ultimately', 'intriguing', 'film']",Fahrenheit 9/11

This is the most important documentary (and yes, it is a documentary) in my lifetime, in any of our lifetimes.Whether or not you're a dyed-in-the-wool Moore-phile (and believe me, I have reservations about the man), this film will make you think twice about our sitting president. No other filmmaker would've dared to take on the Bushes like this, and Moore should be commended, no, thanked by every American who loves this country and loves it honestly (not the kind of ""Mommy can never do wrong"" style of the neocons, possibly the most un-American group since the John Birch Society).I found the film just as powerful as I had heard (living in the South, Fahrenheit had a limited run around here at best, with some theaters not even showing it). The scenes of Iraq during the war (and the human toll it is taking) will break the heart of even the most diehard Bush-lover. I challenge anyone to question the mother who lost her son in terms of whether he died for the right cause. It's all well and good to say that this is a ""just war"". Just be sure you're honest enough when it strikes home.The issues I have with the film are the suggestions that we entered Afghanistan to erect a pipeline, and nothing more. That to me is too awful of a premise, too ""Dr. Strangelove""-ian for me to fathom, but I can't help but wonder. Also, the ties to the Bin Laden family are slight, in many ways, but again you can't help but wonder if Moore is really loony or not to suggest them. It's a damning document of the Bush Administration's efforts to have it both ways (stay on alert, but shop), and the inefficancy of the Administration to combat terror in ways that are effective (as opposed to harassing a man in a gym simply because he questioned the President's motives in Afghanistan, which is shockingly something I suspect more commonplace than we'd like to think).Whether this will change anyone's minds (specifically those who plan to vote Bush), I can't say for sure. I'd like to think no one could be so close-minded as to not even consider seeing it, but I've been wrong before. This is far and away the most important movie of this year, and it is a masterpiece.Some might argue, ""Moore made this film simply to unseat Bush,"" but after seeing it, I can't say I don't blame him. I want the son of a bitch out of office, roasting on the eternal flames of hell, myself, especially after viewing this film. And if that's wrong or ""un-American"" of me, then so be it.

While many critics here are hung up on the politics of the film, let's not forget that documentary making is an art-form and should be approached as such.  It is a artistic means to examine a thesis.  During the late-1980's Michael Moore developed a style of presentation of fact that relied on sharply contrasting public relations rhetoric with cold hard fact.  Watch the camerawork as he cuts from pretentious regalia to cold hard fact.  It's like being in a car going 90 mph and then slamming on the brakes.  A devistating effect!Moore has not done anything too original since Roger and Me in terms of presentation until now.  The master of the muckracking documentary-style is back with the afterburners on.""Bowling for Columbine"" (arguably) did NOT deserve an Oscar (although I'm happy for Moore) because the thesis in ""Coumbine"" is somewhat muddled.  The thesis in F-911, however, is as crystal clear as the thesis in Roger and Me.  Like Roger and Me, on the other hand, the film may not get an Oscar, but you can be damned sure that it will get massive airplay in thousands of college classrooms dedicated to the pursuit of truth in Global Conflict, Sociology, Criminology, Political Science and Documentary making. In F-911 Moore displays skills exhibited by Sociological researchers of the highest order a la C. Wright Mills, who was the first American to point out the intertwined relationships between the upper echelons of: a) military; b) industry; and c) government.In F-911, Moore simply reaffirms his status as a ""Karl Marx for the masses"", in that he examine the nature of power, but in such a colorful way that uneducated persons can actually ""grasp"" some of it.  As Marx predicted, when revelations of these true relationships of power are laid out for these masses, they are shocked into a rude awakening and behave much like a person who is awakened from a deep slumber.  In other words, they are pissed-off because Moore ""woke 'em up"" (to what? To the truth, of course).Well, here's another truth: Calling Moore a ""fat slob"" and saying that he should be ""silenced"" does not markedly increase the credibility of his critics.  In fact it reveals them for what they are: small-minded reactionaries.  Also, saying that Moore ""eats too many Dunkin' Donuts"" does not change the fact that the Bushster is squandering about $390 billion dollars a year on the ""War on Terrorism"" while education, hospitalization, space exploration, local law enforcement and social security programs for the elderly and poor are having the life choked out of them.It is also inaccurate to label Moore's work as ""propoganda"" as the term propoganda is defined as an organized scheme for the propogation of doctrine.  By definition, propoganda does NOT acknowledge any ""middle ground"".  In F-911 Moore does examine both sides of the thesis, thus calling F-911 ""propoganda"" is similar to calling Oliver Stone's ""The Doors"" an ""anti-drug statement"".  By the way, for all the numbskulls out there who think that they ""could make Hitler look good"" if they twisted the facts enough, you should watch Leni Riefenstahl's ""Triumph of the Will"".  The irony here is the remarkable similarities between the type of Nationalist propoganda that Hitler was pushing and the type of colorful Nationalist propoganda that the Bush administration used to fuel its ""war efforts"".If you hated F-911 and you hate Moore, then you must love paying $2 for a gallon of gas and $3.50 for a gallon of milk to feed your kids.  If Dubya steals the vote again in 2004 the US will continue to fight an Orwellian War against enemies that are hidden and globally disbursed.  As Moore implies, prices will continue to rise at the expense of the middle and lower classes.  Industry will have the power to do whatever it wants to America.  (Now, who is our enemy again? I forget.)

630297,A3KLC5M7K1C5FJ,B00005JNEI,Vato-Curandero,"[13, 19]","I will never forget the first time I saw Michael Moore's anger-provoking film, Fahrenheit 9-11. It was June 2004, and I was sitting in a jam-packed theater in ultra-conservative Lancaster, PA. I went to see the movie with a buddy of mine, and the two of us were the only non-right wingers in the theater. We were also only two of a handful of people under the age of retirement in the theater as well. What my friend and I thought was well-placed sarcasm and humor, the right wing Republicans thought was anti-American, biased, Bush bashing. I remember laughing hysterically at certain points of the film...only to encounter the look of death from countless white, right-wing extremists who were dead-set on their blind patriotism. Upon leaving the theater, the real fun began as heated arguments escalated between spectators as they exited.Regardless of your personal politics, or your thoughts on Iraq, or your thoughts on Michael Moore, the record needs to be set straight on a few things. Does Moore promote a particular agenda in this film? Yes, of course he does...as does Bush, Cheney, Rice, and Rumsfeld every single time they get in front of a TV camera for one of their photo-ops. Does Moore distort certain facts and stack the cards to favor his particular point of view? Yes, of course he does...as does Bush, Cheney, Rice, and Rumsfeld every single time they get in front of a TV camera for one of their photo-ops. Wouldn't it be nice if those mindless sheep (Republicans) who scream bloody murder over Moore's ""factual inaccuracies"" in F-911 would get equally heated and steamed everytime Bush or Cheney or Rumsfeld spout lies to the American people about war or weapons of mass destruction?Those who oppose this movie have a particular agenda of their own...they want to stifle any and all opposition to the current militaristic, ""my country right or wrong"" philosophy that has an iron grip on this nation. To them, a free press and freedom of thought and speech is ""dangerous"" and ""unpatriotic"" and aids and abets ""terrorists.""  What a joke!Now...to the film itself. I have always liked the fact that Michael Moore dares to ask the tough questions to the people who most need to be asked them. However...Moore goes one step further and catches them on tape. Remember in Bowling for Columbine when Moore confronted Dick Clark and Charlton Heston over welfare-to-work policies and gun issues? Moore offers us another dose in F-911 when he camps out on the U.S. Capitol Building trying to encourage Congressmen to send their sons and daughters into the military to fight in Iraq. Their Congressmen's silence is deafening.Moore employs plenty of his smart-alecky, sarcastic humor in Fahrenheit 9-11 to underscore several points: Bush's secret financial relationship with the Saudis, America's historic partnerships with Iraq and Bin Laden, the Bush Administration's botched response to the 9-11 Commission, the ridiculous ""Coalition of the Willing"" nonsense, the Patriot Act's true intentions, and the invasion of Iraq as a decoy and diversion.As with all of Moore's films, Fahrenheit 9-11 mixes drama with satire, humor with gripping seriousness. The most poignant parts of the film deal with 9-11 survivors and their relatives and also the relatives of soldiers killed in Iraq. These scenes are almost too painful to watch.F-911 has some fairly violent and distrubing images, however. One scene shows footage of a public decapitation in Saudi Arabia, and there are several other scenes that depict images of innocent civilians injured and maimed or even killed in the current Iraq war.The only part of 9-11 that I thought should have been left out was the first 10 minutes of the film when Moore recounts the Bush presidency from Election Day 2000 up until September 10, 2001. It is clear that this was intended to smear and humiliate Bush, and served no overall meaningful purpose in critiquing Bush's policies post-911.Overall, if you are open-minded and want to explore the current situation in Iraq from a different angle than the everyday spin you get on Fox News, then this film is definitely worth checking out. The DVD is packed with plenty of nice extras, including footage on the release of F-911 and the notoriety it garnered. There is also a great extra on Arab American comedians and how they have incorporated the post-911 backlash against Arabs into their routines. Other extras include footage of Condoleeza Rice's cherade in front of the 9/11 Commission and Bush's press conference spin following his private meeting with the 9/11 Commission, along with a segment on Abu Ghraib and the handling of prisoners by Army personnel.Freedom of speech is a wonderful thing, isn't it?",4,The film the Bush Administration does NOT want you to see!,1134345600,"12 12,

630298,A38TC59GM2WW1X,B00005JNEI,"Victor Chen ""Messerschmitts""","[23, 29]","Michael Moore's magnum opus ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" has become the de facto anthem of, in particular, anyone anti-Bush, and in general, liberals everywhere.  This is for good reason.  Just as the 9/11 attack was a wake-up call to the American people towards the threat of terrorism, Moore's scathing indictment of the Bush Administration is a wake-up call towards the threat of America's own current government.""Fahrenheit 9/11"" seems to be neatly broken down into two ""acts"".  In the first act, Moore weaves a scenario of political intrigue, conspiracies, and cloak-and-dagger what-ifs.  He makes some indisputably disturbing points; for example, why was the Patriot Act printed in the middle of the night, and voted on in the morning, effectively preventing any congresspeople from reading it?  However, I don't give Moore 5 stars, because I honestly found the first half of the film/documentary/political statement to be somewhat convoluted and difficult to follow.  Moore's soft, difficult-to-hear voice does not help.  The ""conspiracy theory"" involving the Bushes' connexion with the Bin Laden family and the Saudis seem a bit speculative and circumstantial, although they do make you think.That said, there is nothing short of genius in the second half of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", which begins after Bush launches the Iraq war.  There is nothing confusing or speculative about the inhuman atrocities suffered by the Iraqi people.  There is nothing confusing about the Iraqi father carrying the mutilated corpse of his young daughter.  There is nothing confusing about the American mother Mrs. Lipscomb's inconsolable grief over the loss of her irreplaceable son to the war.  Lipscomb's journey from being a steadfast conservative to her ultimate disillusionment and complete loss of faith in the current administration is both sobering and heartbreaking to watch.  And there is, last of all, nothing confusing that both sides are dying for the greed and evil of one unjust administration.  Really sit down and think, ""why are we fighting this war?""  None of the 9/11 terrorists had any connexions with Iraq.  There are no WMDs in Iraq.  But there is oil.  And now there ARE terrorists in Iraq; we have become the terrorists.Moore's command of the mood and tone of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is masterful.  He begins with the feature with his characteristic brand of hilarious, scathing social commentary.  However, the tone of the documentary gradually and imperceptably becomes increasing somber in tone.  The ending is overwhelmingly poignant and powerful, leaving nary a dry eye in the house.  Moore brilliantly ends with this statement (not verbatum, from my memory):  ""Our brave fighting men and women sacrifice themselves to defend our freedom, so that we don't have to.  And all they ask for return is that we never send them into harm's way unless ABSOLUTELY necessary.  Can they ever trust us again?""

But one must watch it with an open and honest mind to grasp its true value to America.After months of anticipation and media hype (most of it bad) I couldn't wait to watch this DVD. I will say that one should watch this film after having formed their own opinion because I imagine it has the ability to make up the mind of the entirely clueless. Moore portrays President Bush as an arrogant bumbling idiot without one good quality. Personally I don't believe that to be so but I also have a healthy perspective on where his administration has erred America as well. Every one can be filmed during their worst moments and made to look foolish so the scenes filmed by Moore about President Bush didn't impress me. I don't believe ANYONE could have known how to react on 9/11 and not look foolish, we all paid a price on that day that shouldn't be mocked, it is history and that day will never be changed it is only our futures that stand a chance. I believe this film will force you to get involved, to take a stand and to care how America is represented, the fog has been lifted and now we are all responsible.This film does not get interesting, unless you like to ""Bushbash,"" until the Iraq war comes into play. We see children playing on swing sets and women going to market, Iraqi smiles and laughter and then BOOM! For people who have chosen to watch the war only through the eyes of our popular media this film will open your eyes to a truth really too horrible for any of us to imagine. Moore manages to show the devastation that Iraq has felt because of American decisions. Their blood drips on each and every one of us especially our precious soldiers. It is important to realize here that the poor and uneducated are fighting the same. An effective moment in this film is when Moore attempts to recruit the children of American congressmen for service in Iraq.....and the answer is? As for our soldiers they are trained to kill, asked to kill and faced with death every day something unfathomable to imagine dealing with. Moore presents the difficulties that our soldiers face in Iraq as well as the abuses that Iraqis are suffering. The footage is not easy to get through without feeling touched and often ashamed. Watching a mother read a letter from her son killed in battle is almost impossible to endure but we must in order for it all to change. Regardless of your political beliefs allow this film to affect you!This DVD has many very interesting ""extras"" that further the horror of what is taking place before the world's eyes in Iraq. But what can be done? Moore is doing something, taking a stand is doing something, developing compassion is doing something and asking questions is doing something. The only bad question is the one not asked! Moore asks and even answers many questions with this extraordinary film. The fact that it was accepted so well internationally must mean something. Like it or not being a proud American doesn't just stop at our own borders, our pride exists in the universe as well and maybe after watching this film that fact will matter.

But let's be honest, here: 'Fahrenheit 9/11' is a biased account based on intense political opinion, through and through. Though there are moments that are undeniably powerful, undeniably real, there were other segments where I could not get past the blatant, overly-obvious jabs at Bush's reputation. They were a bit too unskilled in their upfrontness, even for a director such as Moore who doesn't seem to take himself as seriously sometimes as others do. If Moore is attempting to persuade the American public to convert to an anti-Bush standpoint or allow people to see what he believes is really going on, I wish he would have been more careful and mature in handling such delicate situations (namely the book-reading incident on September 11, 2001). Instead, Moore's hate becomes a malignant force, eating away at moments he could have used to his advantage.

His desire is that the ignorant American public will assume that because before and after is truth, the lie must also be true.Also, part of making a quality documentary is making sure that the entire story is shown.  Instead, this movie represents the highlights of what Moore saw.  Anyone who had taken in all the events in sequence and perspective would not have come to the same overly biased opinion of the events.  This movie is like putting George Bush on trial for only two hours and never giving him a chance for defence.  Its a good thing Michael Moore didn't design our court system.Sadly, Americans too often lack the disipline and the intelligence to look for the story not told.  Michael Moore is obviously a film maker and not a analysts or political strategist.

However, I was surprised by how leaden it was compared to his more entertaining (and effective) ""Bowling for Columbine"" and ""Roger and Me.""  Although some scenes were undeniably powerful - such as interviews with the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq, other sections did not work very well, particularly snippets of political speeches taken out of context.However, to me, the biggest flaw was Moore's mixed messages about the armed forces. He repeatedly hammers home the message that the men and women sent to Iraq are from poor neighborhoods and signed up because of a lack of other opportunities in their lives, making them sympathetic.  However, in interviews with soldiers in Iraq, he depicts them as ruthless killing machines - carelessly killing Iraqi civilians while listening to Drowning Pool.  Why does Moore undermine his message so severely?Overall, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is a middling documentary, but the fact that it was so successful cannot be denied. The American public was seeking out in a film the answers they didn't think they were getting from politicians and even the media.

630311,AAD2DYRK43BYF,B00005JNEI,Weston J. Kathman,"[37, 90]","George W. Bush is not a great president; in fact, he is a major expansionist who will likely blow up the federal deficit into the tens of trillions, especially now that he has won a second term.  Part of the reason that Bush has not been effectively defeated is that his opponents have become too unhinged, just as many prominent Republicans seemed to lose their sanity during the Clinton years.  In politics, it is often not that one side clearly prevails, but that the other side, due to its own excesses, manages to completely alienate a majority of the American electorate.  What we have seen since the 2000 election is the rise of several rabid leftists -- George Soros, the wackos in Hollywood, etc. -- who foam at the mouth and generally make complete asses of themselves while attempting to discredit the president.  Michael Moore may be the best example of this collection of hotheads and malcontents.  Many observers have voiced their outrage at Moore's antics; people like me, however, realize the man for what he is: a pompous fool who does more harm to his causes than any Republican ever could.  Rather than rail against this filmmaker, Bush loyalists should offer to subsidize his next feature film.Moore's latest offering, the amazingly dishonest FAHRENHEIT 9/11, may be his most ridiculous project to date.  The same idiot who told us that terrorism was not a problem has now made an entire film excoriating the Bush Administration for not going after Osama Bin Laden.  As usual, the filmmaker has presented a number of themes, many of which completely contradict each other (BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE was even more notorious in its dreadful lack of consistency).  At one point in the movie, Moore implies that the American troops in Iraq are cold-hearted neandrathals who derive great pleasure from torturing and murdering innocent civilians.  Later he feigns sympathy for those serving in the armed services, portraying them as a bunch of poor kids who had few options in life but to join the military (and thus, Moore also plays the standard class warfare game).  Again, consistency has never been a staple of this man's work.Much of the rest of this shoddy picture is nothing more than a tribute to manipulative film splicing.  Any hack with the proper equipment can edit footage in such a way as to make even the most intelligent person look like a buffoon.  Moore is a master at this.  Such sophomoric tactics are most fully on display near the beginning of the film.  There is a whole sequence that features muted footage of various members of the Bush Administration, including the commander in chief himself, primping themselves just before going on camera.  In one shot, Paul Wolfowitz, that hated Neocon and Zionist, licks his hand and then uses it to fix his hair.  If Moore expects his viewers to laugh at such silly cheap shots, he has even less respect for the audience than I originally assumed.  There are plenty of valid ways to oppose the current cadre that controls the White House; unfortunately, none of these ways are explored in this shameful attempt at discourse.Most of FAHRENHEIT is either comically false or mildly irritating.  However, some of the film is beyond merely obnoxious.  In one of the most outrageous scenes in the movie, we are treated to images of pre-war Iraq, which is (surprise!  surprise!) a blissful utopia where carefree children fly kites and elderly women sit on their porches soaking up the joyous atmosphere.  Sympathy for tyrannical dictators -- in this case, Mr. Hussein -- has always been a characteristic of the left.  Moore has taken this bias to a whole new level of sophistry.  Wicked regimes that murder their own people in the millions are never as nefarious as capitalist America's vicious imperialism.  The filmmaker also spends much time exploiting the sorrow of a woman who has lost a son in Iraq.  The ironic thing is that the woman strongly encouraged each of her male family members to join the military.  One can easily sympathize with her pain, but shouldn't a person know that those who join the armed services are taking the risk of dying in battle, whether just or unjust?  Having witnessed Moore's attempt to milk this poor woman's grief for all its worth, the average viewer may be more enraged at the filmmaker's grotesque behavior than saddened by the tragedy of a young man's untimely death.Like all Moore pictures, FAHRENHEIT is a manipulative piece of propaganda that a certain, feeble-minded percentage of the public will undoubtedly buy hook, line, and sinker.  What is actually in the movie is not nearly as ominous as its fairly impressive popularity: the debate in the nation is increasingly being hijacked by duplicitous self promoters and clownish bunko artists.  The snobbery and self-righteousness of the left have finally caught up with them.  While many of the right's most prominent figures have sacrificed their traditional principles of limited government in order to support a president who constantly seeks to expand federal power,  the narcissism of America's statist liberals have rendered conservative hypocrisy insignificant.  We have truly reached the point where the inmates are running the asylum.  That Moore is a mainstream figure in today's media world speaks volumes about our current state of affairs.",1,Lunacy of the Left on Full Display,1099440000,"11 3, 2004",2004,5322,"['George', 'W.',

630312,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,B00005JNEI,William Hare,"[14, 28]","After Michael Moore received a twenty minute standing ovation at the recent Cannes Film Festival and had its highest honor, the Gold Palm Award, bestowed on him, Quentin Tarantino explained to him that a significant number of Cannes' voting members were not the least bit political.  Tarantino assured Moore that the award was given on the basis of filmmaking expertise and not due to the film's political message.  Even at Fox News, a conservative cable network, the film was given a positive review on the basis of the technical expertise displayed on screen.From a purely technical standpoint the film is a masterpiece, moving briskly from emotional scene to scene, the camera's all-seeing eye recording all.  The technical virtuosity, highlighted by excellent photography, delivers to viewers a close-up of government at its nastiest ""it's all for sale"" level along with the consequences of those brazenly materialistic actions, that of sending young men and women from the least affluent areas of our society, victims of the social rip offs of the privileged top dogs, to do their fighting after destroying avenues to a better future in pursuing their greedy agenda.The charge has been raised that Moore's film is not objective.  The objective of any film about any serious subject is to make a statement in the eyes of the filmmaker.  Commentators of the right reveal their viewpoint regularly.  What is unusual therefore for Michael Moore to do the same?Those who criticize have the opportunity to rebut the content of what appears on screen, as well as the chance to present an alternative film presenting what they consider to be a correct statement of they way things are.  As for Moore, it is impossible to rebut the touching segment of the woman from his hometown of Flint, Michigan who changed her opinion of the war after her son serving in Iraq wrote from the battle zone and sharply criticized Bush administration policies.  Not long after he wrote the letter he was dead.  This woman was not a performer.  This was real life.Were those statements and images from American servicemen on the scene rigged?  The emotional scenes included individuals shouting emotionally about destroying the enemy as well as those regretfully relating how big a mistake America had made in invading Iraq.  Were those scenes of destruction of civilians, including helpless children, faked?  Were those evening missions breaking into houses of innocent civilians actors playing fictional roles?Were those statements and images from American servicemen on the scene rigged?  The emotional scenes included individuals shouting emotionally about destroying the enemy as well as those regretfully relating how big a mistake America had made in invading Iraq.  Were those scenes of destruction of civilians, including helpless children, faked?  Were those evening missions breaking into houses of innocent civilians actors playing fictional roles?Was the bin Laden family given safe passage out of America shortly after 9-11, as Moore claims?  Did Bush serve in the National Guard with James Bath, who in turn set him up in business later with Osama bin Laden's chief American representative?  Are Bush's father, along with his longtime political associate and friend, James Baker, active members of the Carlyle Group?  Does the Carlyle Group, which also includes Henry Kissinger, maintain the closest possible ties, and lucrative ones at that, with the Saudi government?  Does the Saudi government behead people, one of the reasons stated why we needed to liberate Iraq?  Was the man who handed the big aid bundle with a smile to Saddam Hussein in 1983 actually who he appeared to be in the picture, none other than ""liberate Iraq from its oppressors"" Donald Rumsfeld?  Did we not hear Bush and Cheney assert 1) that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, and 2) that Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein were linked?  Did they furnish verifiable proof?Go see the film and decide for yourself about Fahrenheit 9-11 regardless of your political persuasion.

The humor in this, and others such as ""Bowling for Columbine"" are funny only in the serious play on the ironic -- remember the bank giving away free guns with a new account? But in this the issue is not guns, but the use of serious irony in interpreting political action. The target audience, those that like it, I think need no persuasion. They cheer the movie because it presents their point of view. Perhaps little else in movies does. Those that do not share the point of view react with horror. Isn't this a Straw Man argument? Putting supposed thoughts in someone's head while they sit in a class room is not science or fact especially when the information given suggests guilt by association. Who else did business with the Bin Ladens? IBM? How much gas have you used in your car? So who are the merely foolish for watching this? Those that watch this for the entertainment value are not entertained since it pretends to be too serious. They may only get angry. Those that watch for narrative re-enforcement and think narrative interpretation is fact are the ones I think most foolish and most attracted to it.

630317,A3PXS00XF1TLS9,B00005JNEI,"Xander Xavier Xymox ""Black metal rivethead an...","[12, 29]","Let me start by saying that this film doesnt tell the truth! About now you think I am a GOP fan boy. However the film doesnt tell the truth because mr Moor doesnt go far enough. Yeah we all know the Bush's have oil dealings with Saudi Arabia. The problem is thats only the surface of the corruption.Following is a list of things this film skips over.On the morning of Sept 11- Standard air defence mechanisms systematically failed, simultaneously. When a plain deviates from course an attempt is made to contact the plain. If there is no responce Jets are scrambled to intercept the plain and guide it back to the airport. This is actually pretty common. It happens about 60-100 times a year. Without fail there is an innocent explanation for the course deviation nearly all the time. Now the fighter jets that scramble are far faster than any jetliners and if this happened on the morning of 9-11 the fighter jet would have reached the first plain in time to shoot it down. Now assuming the military was just incompitant as the administration would have you think. Than why were they still asleep for the next 3 attacks? The military records of that morning suggest that interceptor jets were scrambled too late, too slowly and from the wrong locations. An interesting side note is usually when there is a failure of this magnitude someone is punished or fired. In the case of 9-11 the military commanders in charge were promoted! Another interesting fact is that fires could not have caused the collapse of the towers. No high rise has ever collapsed due to fires. The idea that the fire melted the steal beams and the towers collapsed is dead wrong. To melt the steal beams the fires would have to be far hotter than 2000 degrees. Experts say the fire from jet fuel is hot but not hot enough. Now assuming the tops melted and collapsed dont you think the floors below would have at least momentarily provided resistance to the collapse? Instead both buildings collapsed in under 15 seconds. For a building that tall that is free-fall speed. Also the first two firefighters that came the closest to the 80th floor where impact was made thought the fires were manageable. They didnt describe a raging inferno. Istead they radiod for two lines to be brought up to put out two isolated fires. Minutes later without warning the towers collapsed on them. Prior to the collapse the seismologist at Columbia university recorded two spikes indicating large burst of energy that shook the ground just before there collapse. They were 2.1 and 2.3 on the richter scale respectivly. You couple that with dozens of survivors who's testimony says they heard other explosians on other floors prior too the collapse. A building colapsing on its own would not have produced all the dust that you see in in the video. Only a high energy explosian can reduce concrete to dust. If you can think back to that day on the news about 5 pm  they announced that building 7 collapsed. It was said that fires once again melted a 47 story steal frame building. Later on the govt changed there story and admitted it was pulled. Pulled is the technical term for demolishing a building. Why did they lie to begin with? Could they have also detonated the towers? We will never know if the steel in the debris tested positive for explosive residue,since before they could be examined the steel was sent on ships to china to be sold as scrap metal! Than there is the stock market.There was massive short selling of stocks just before the attacks. American and United Airlines as well as Morgan Stanly were involved. Somebody new ahead of time that these Airlines were going to down in the stock market. Morgan Stanly had offices in the world trade center. All three were affected by the attacks. Somebody profited millions by shortselling these stocks. Another good question is how could the pentagon been attacked? It is the most highly defended building in the wetern hemisphere yet they say a plain hit it. And this is after the govt already new we were under attack.Anyways I could give you details forever. I suggest that you just read a good book like The New Pearl harbor. If you cant read go to infowars.com and buy the dvd 9-11 The Road to Tyranny by alex Jones. He is concerned with getting the truth out so there is no copyright on his dvd you can make copies and distribute them for free for educational purposes. As far as Moor is concerned I dont understand why he didnt bring out facts. He probably new no theatre would carry a movie that told the truth so he wouldnt make any money on it. He was more concerned with getting Bush out of the whitehouse by having people vote for Kerry. Let me make this clear the democrats are just as responsible. All they think about is there careers so they wont say anything extreme that might make them look ""un umerican"". The truth is extreme though.

Well, which is it? Is Bush a doofus, or a mastermind?

Moore says Saddam made no threats against the US, but meanwhile Usay's newspapers flagrantly pronounced ""Death to America"".  It's OK for Usay to pronounce virulant hatred, but Saddam is not a threat?  This piece of garbage is one of the greatest propaganda films since Leni Reifenstahl.  Moore also illustrates how the Bin Laden family were the first to fly out of America and had ""special connections"".  The Bin Ladens were considered not a threat by the FBI and were not allowed to fly out until 2 days after, when the airlines first returned to flying.  If you were a Bin Laden family member, would you too have not been on the first plane out of the US?  I don't understand how Moore's film is heralded by the left who have become absolutely oblivious to our countries values.Moore further documents that Bush sat around and didn't do anything for 7 minutes.  Well, he is the Commander in Chief and there are safeguards allowed where he doesn't have to overreact in front of second graders and run.  President Bush is the first president to have an MBA and he sat for several minutes calculating, knowing full well that his though processes were being documented for all to judge, and if he jumped up and reacted, that too would have been criticized.  If his staff thought that it was expedient for him to jump up and react; they would have certainly done so, instead he set an example as a leader and handled the situation in a business like manner, which was his job, a business-man in a political position, running the largest $ business in the world.Without any shame, Michael Moore capitalizes on soldier's who nobley gave their lives for the sake of freedom across the world, and Moore shamelessly exploits and desecrates their sacred funeral rites and injuries, in order to line his pockets. Benedict Arnold died a death known to traitors, our democracy allows Moore to perpetuate his cowardly behavior, and he shows his appreciation by exploiting our soldier's (this country's greatest asset) funerals and manipualing people's emotions by telling outrageous lies.
