Simply because I wasn't familiar with the characters. That changed when I saw a good deal on Amazon forLeapFrog: Learning DVD Setand decided to try it. I was very surprised with how our 6 year old reacted to that set of dvd's. He liked them a lot, watches them regularly, and learns from them.Based on that experienced, and since our 6 yol, likes music, singing and even dancing,.... we're planning to get this new dvd. Again, the characters depicted on the cover, seems quite odd to me (I look at the cover, and Halloween comes to mind). And kind of more in the range for 3-4 year old kids. Because of my perception, I normally would not buy this dvd, ... but since the surprise with the previous dvd set, .... I think it's worth a try. I will update this review, and if needed also the star rating, in due time.UPDATE 19 July 2011:Got the dvd. It's fun, and entertaining, for young kids. Perhaps more so for kids 3-5. They learn through singing a long. The songs are quite catchy. Our 6 yol, enjoyed it, altough he also wanted to watch other dvd's. So I'm thinking the younger your kids, the more they will like it.Apparently this is a 'remake' of an earlier Leapfrog dvd, ""Sing-along Read-along"", but this newer version, has a new set of characters. The ""Sing-along Read-along"" dvd, came with a booklet with songs, but with the ""Sing and Learn with us"" version, you can download 12 Sing-along storybooks, so the your kids will be able to take the songs where ever they go.",5,"FUN and ENTERTAINING, especially for 3 - 5....",1304985600,"05 10, 2011",2011,1589,"['MAY', '10', '2011', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Leapfrog', 'Leapster2', 'Explorer', 'never', 'ever', 'thought', 'buying', 'Leapfrog', 'DVD', 'Simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'characters', 'changed', 'when', 'saw', 'good', 'deal', 'Amazon', 'forLeapFrog', 'Learning', 'DVD', 'Setand', 'decided', 'try', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'how', '6', 'year', 'old', 'reacted', 'set', 'dvd', 'liked', 'lot', 'regularly', 'them.Based', 'experienced', '6', 'yol', 'music', 'singing', 'even', 'dancing', ""'re"", 'planning', 'get', 'new', 'dvd', 'Again', 'characters', 'depicted', 'cover', 'quite', 'odd', 'look', 'cover', 'Halloween', 'mind', 'kind', 'more', 'range', '3-4', 'year', 'old', 'kids', 'perception', 'normally', 'would', 'not', 'buy', 'dvd', 'surprise', 'previous', 'dvd', 'set', 'think', 'try', 'will', 'update', 'review', 'needed', 'also', 'star', 'rating', 'due', 'time.UPDATE', '19', 'July', '2011', 'Got', 'dvd', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'young', 'kids', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'so', 'kids', '3-5', 'learn', 'singing', 'long', 'songs', 'are', 'quite', 'catchy', '6', 'yol', 'enjoyed', 'also', 'wanted', 'watch', 'other', 'dvd', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'younger', 'kids', 'more', 'will', 'like', 'it.Apparently', ""'remake"", 'earlier', 'Leapfrog', 'dvd', 'Sing-along', 'Read-along', 'newer', 'version', 'new', 'set', 'characters', 'Sing-along', 'Read-along', 'dvd', 'came', 'booklet', 'songs', 'Sing', 'Learn', 'version', 'can', 'download', '12', 'Sing-along', 'storybooks', 'kids', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'take', 'songs', 'where', 'ever', 'go']",LeapFrog: Sing and Learn With Us!

Gallagher ""teachingheart net""","[30, 33]","If you have some of the other Leap Frog videos and think that the characters on this will be similar to Tad found inLeapFrog Leapster Educational Video: The Letter Factory, you would be wrong.  This video is totally different than the originals.  I suggest gettingLeapFrog Leapster Educational Video: The Letter Factoryfirst and then purchasing this video.  The Letter Factory focuses on Letters and the sounds they make.  The Letter Factory is the best DVD for teaching your kids what pre-phonics skills, in my opinion. Sing and Learn with us is a nice DVD to show once the Letter FActory has been viewed.Sing and Learn with us includes new characters; Al, Og, Meg, Izzy and Gus.  These toe-tapping characters perform 12 animated sing-along shorts focusing on developmental reading skills; such as, short vowels, phonics skills (word building) and comprehension - skills perfect for the preschool to first grade crowd.  Great for those kiddos that have some knowledge of the sounds letters make and who are ready to start building CVC words.  The music included is fun and catchy, and it's easy for kids to follow along on the screen with the words being highlighted as you go.  It is nice to always see all the words on the bottom of the screen.  A beginning reader can follow along and read while watching.  My Pre-K child enjoyed the DVD very much.  It is 30 minutes and it seems to cover enough material without overwhelming the child with too much details.The DVD also doubles as a DVD-ROM, where if you put the DVD into your computer drive, you'll be able to access 12 printable sing-along storybooks and 3 printable coloring sheets too!  The activities are a perfect way to continue learning and having fun!!!",4,Another Learning Hit From Leap Frog,1311120000,"07 20, 2011",2011,1717,"['have', 'other', 'Leap', 'Frog', 'videos', 'think', 'characters', 'will', 'be', 'similar', 'Tad', 'found', 'inLeapFrog', 'Leapster', 'Educational', 'Video', 'Letter', 'Factory', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'video', 'totally', 'different', 'originals', 'suggest', 'gettingLeapFrog', 'Leapster', 'Educational', 'Video', 'Letter', 'Factoryfirst', 'then', 'purchasing', 'video', 'Letter', 'Factory', 'Letters', 'sounds', 'make', 'Letter', 'Factory', 'best', 'DVD', 'teaching', 'kids', 'what', 'pre-phonics', 'skills', 'opinion', 'Sing', 'Learn', 'nice', 'DVD', 'show', 'once', 'Letter', 'FActory', 'been', 'viewed.Sing', 'Learn', 'new', 'characters', 'Al', 'Og', 'Meg', 'Izzy', 'Gus', 'toe-tapping', 'characters', 'perform', '12', 'animated', 'sing-along', 'shorts', 'focusing', 'developmental', 'reading', 'skills', 'such', 'short', 'vowels', 'phonics', 'skills', 'word', 'building', 'comprehension', 'skills', 'perfect', 'preschool', 'first', 'grade', 'crowd', 'Great', 'kiddos', 'have', 'knowledge', 'sounds', 'letters', 'make', 'who', 'are', 'ready', 'start', 'building', 'CVC', 'words', 'music', 'included', 'fun', 'catchy', 'easy', 'kids', 'follow', 'along', 'screen', 'words', 'being', 'highlighted', 'go', 'nice', 'always', 'see', 'words', 'bottom', 'screen', 'beginning', 'reader', 'can', 'follow', 'along', 'read', 'watching', 'Pre-K', 'child', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'very', 'much', '30', 'minutes', 'cover', 'enough', 'material', 'overwhelming', 'child', 'too', 'much', 'details.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'DVD-ROM', 'where', 'put', 'DVD', 'computer', 'drive', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'access', '12', 'printable', 'sing-along', 'storybooks', '3', 'printable', 'coloring', 'sheets', 'too', 'activities', 'are', 'perfect', 'way', 'continue', 'learning', 'having', 'fun']",LeapFrog: Sing and Learn With Us!

I have been trying to figure out how to advance from that point, and came across this video. It is superb. Why? Because the version I have has captions on the bottom in English that he can read along with. It has short little dance and song clips with lots of simple words, mostly rhyming. It's a lot of fun and keeps his attention. But not just limited to using words, this includes contextual clues, and several different definitions. For example ""Dig"" as in ""digging with a rig"" (digging with a large digger truck) and ""dig"" in the groovy sense as in ""liking something a lot"" (a dancing pig that looks like elvis). Thru repetition and tone variance this is a great way to show kids sounds and words so that they gather new comprehension of words, as well as how to spell them. the words are generally simple enough for kids that age to understand already, or have come into contact, so they aren't complicated or foreign concepts at all.",5,After the alphabet.. then this!,1375488000,"08 3, 2013",2013,994,"['2', '1/2', 'yr', 'old', 'known', 'alphabet', 'time', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'advance', 'point', 'came', 'video', 'superb', 'Why', 'version', 'have', 'captions', 'bottom', 'English', 'can', 'read', 'short', 'little', 'dance', 'song', 'clips', 'lots', 'simple', 'words', 'mostly', 'rhyming', 'lot', 'fun', 'keeps', 'attention', 'not', 'just', 'limited', 'using', 'words', 'contextual', 'clues', 'several', 'different', 'definitions', 'example', 'Dig', 'digging', 'rig', 'digging', 'large', 'digger', 'truck', 'dig', 'groovy', 'sense', 'liking', 'something', 'lot', 'dancing', 'pig', 'elvis', 'Thru', 'repetition', 'tone', 'variance', 'great', 'way', 'show', 'kids', 'sounds', 'words', 'so', 'gather', 'new', 'comprehension', 'words', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'spell', 'words', 'are', 'generally', 'simple', 'enough', 'kids', 'age', 'understand', 'already', 'have', 'come', 'contact', 'are', ""n't"", 'complicated', 'foreign', 'concepts']",LeapFrog: Sing and Learn With Us!
