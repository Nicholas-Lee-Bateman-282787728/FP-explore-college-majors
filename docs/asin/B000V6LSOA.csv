Ann (Vanessa Redgrave) is on her deathbed, and she is dying of cancer.  Her daughters Constance (Natasha Richardson) and Nina (Toni Collette) come to talk and get some resolution in their own lives.  Meanwhile, Nina and Hannah spar with one another. Nina regards Hannah as having a `House and Garden' life, while she has trouble settling on one job or lover.  Both have their own resentments toward one another.  Both children look for closure and wisdom from their bedside chats.  Ann, however, has regrets of her own.  (""You don't know your life from your mistakes,"" she broods.)The movie often cuts back to her youth when she was a bridesmaid.  Her best friend Lila (Claire Danes) is getting married, but she is miserable.  Ann is a devoted friend and will do everything to avert her impending marriage to Carl for the real love of her life, Harris (Patrick Wilson), a former housekeeper's son.  She also sings at Lila's wedding. This takes place in the midst of a storybook mansion with a lot of talk about love and relationships, regrets and lack of fulfillment at an early age.  Lila's brother Buddy (Hugh Dancy) is like Sebastian of 'Brideshead Revisited,'Brideshead Revisited (25th Anniversary Collector's Edition).  Which is an analogy he would completely understand, since while swilling too much alcohol, the would-be writer keeps quoting and swiping lines from famous novels without delivering one of his own.  All of the lives seem solidified as plans and actualities assert themselves the way John Lennon wrote, ""Life is what happens to you when you're busy making other plans.""  Memory fast forwards to meetings with family and friends, and we see their lives gel years earlier just after the wedding and as the drama comes to an end.  An Irish nurse maid, looking like a fairy godmother, dotes on Ann and has her think of a happy time in her life.  The results are an insult to an 'Our Town' memory.'Evening' is a mixed outing.  It starts off with self-conscious soap-opera dialogue that speaks of large matters in trivial ways until later when things actually start to happen.  The result is that it takes a long time for us to care about the characters and what happens to them until it's almost too late.  All the performances are excellent, but beg for better material.  It has a lot of girl talk that's been done so much better before.  I can only think of mother-daughter conversations in bed in scenes of 'Terms of Endearment' that were so much more effective.  And the regrets about Mr. Right were more poignantly presented in one portion of 'Nine Lives' than the composite of this picture.  I did go into this film with ""great expectations,"" however.  Seeing the likes of Streep, Redgrave, Collette, Close, and Wilson in one movie, I felt disappointed.  Much of the development is too sentimental and trivial to merit our attention.  Nevertheless, what momentum is initially lost gets better, and Hugh Dancy as Buddy, unexpectedly gives the highlight performance in this beautiful, but often ineffective movie. Thoughtful at times, it left me with a lot of ""star-gazing"" regrets of my own.

1099098,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000V6LSOA,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 5]","What happens when you get some of our legendary actresses (Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Glenn Close) together with some of our finest younger actresses (Claire Danes, Toni Collette, Natasha Richardson)?  Well, what did happen and what `should' have happened are two very different things.  I had very high hopes for this film before it opened and the bad press started pouring in like water from the Niagara.  My wife and I (thankfully) waited till it was released on video before giving it a try.  I won't say that the film is `terrible', but when you factor in the greatness that is gracing the screen you become increasingly disappointed with the outcome.  With talent like Streep and Danes together you'd expect this to have the word OSCAR stamped on it's forehead but my gut tells me Oscar will be pretty far away from this one.The film opens with a woman named Ann on her deathbed.  Ann in this stage of her life is played by Vanessa Redgrave who looks quite a bit like death here.  Sadly the script really gives her nothing to work with when in fact it could have been a touching and emotional performance for her.  Luckily she has the buzz rolling over from `Atonement' to give her some awards attention this year.  As she lays there dying she dreams of her past life and utters the name Harris.  Her daughters Nina and Constance overhear her and begin to wonder just who this man is or was.  As they unlock the secrets of their mothers past they uncover quite a bit they never knew about their mother.In flashbacks we see Ann as a young woman played by Claire Danes.  Ann is visiting friends for a wedding.  Her best friend Lila is getting married and she is to be the maid of honor.  Lila's brother Buddy feels she is making a grave mistake and falls upon Ann to talk his sister out of the wedding.  Lila's parents on the other hand are very happy with their daughter's choice in a man.  This brings us to Harris, a young doctor who is the apple of just about everyone's eyes.  Ann is immediately smitten and it appears that both Buddy and Lila have their crushes on Harris as well.  Buddy is insistent that it is Harris whom Lila should be marrying and not Carl.What is very unfortunate about this movie is that it rarely gives anyone in the cast a chance to truly shine.  Claire Danes is decent but not what I expected from her.  She has in the past been much, much better.  I will mention that if in fact it is Danes singing in this film (and I think that it is) then she has an amazing voice and should pursue that at some point in her career.  Aside from Danes it is Toni Collette who has the most screen time and she is actually the best actress in the bunch as far as handling her material well.  It's far from award worthy but it's best in show.  Natasha Richardson is decent in underused.  Redgrave, as I mentioned, is wasted as is Streep who is in all of five minutes maybe and looks like a plastic mannequin.  Glenn Close has one scene where she falls on the floor screaming and it's convincing if not a tad over the top.  Aside from that she's vacant.  Newcomer Mamie Gummer (Streep's daughter) is decent here and actually shows some promise, but her character is lost in the expansive cast.  The male actors in the film are here to provide testosterone and that alone I gather.  Wilson, who had a phenomenal year last year, is nothing but eye candy here and Hugh Dancy is annoying and well, that's about it.In the end `Evening' was truly a waste of an evening on my part.  It wasn't dreadful but it was far from rewarding.  I can't see myself ever watching this film again nor really recommending it, which is sad because admitting that Meryl Streep was ever in a `mediocre at best' type film is a very, very hard thing to do.",2,Sadly it proved to be a wasted evening...,1192406400,"10 15, 2007",2007,3752,"['What', 'when', 'get', 'legendary', 'actresses', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'together', 'finest', 'younger', 'actresses', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Natasha', 'Richardson', 'Well', 'what', 'did', 'happen', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'happened', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'things', 'had', 'very', 'high', 'hopes', 'film', 'opened', 'bad', 'press', 'started', 'pouring', 'like', 'water', 'Niagara', 'wife', 'thankfully', 'waited', 'till', 'was', 'released', 'video', 'giving', 'try', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'terrible', 'when', 'factor', 'greatness', 'gracing', 'screen', 'become', 'increasingly', 'disappointed', 'outcome', 'talent', 'Streep', 'Danes', 'together', ""'d"", 'expect', 'have', 'word', 'OSCAR', 'stamped', 'forehead', 'gut', 'tells', 'Oscar', 'will', 'be', 'pretty', 'far', 'away', 'one.The', 'film', 'woman', 'named', 'Ann', 'deathbed', 'Ann', 'stage', 'life', 'played', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'who', 'quite', 'bit', 'death', 'here', 'Sadly', 'script', 'really', 'nothing', 'work', 'when', 'fact', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'touching', 'emotional', 'performance', 'Luckily', 'buzz', 'rolling', 'Atonement', 'give', 'awards', 'attention', 'year', 'there', 'dying', 'dreams', 'past', 'life', 'name', 'Harris', 'daughters', 'Nina', 'Constance', 'overhear', 'begin', 'wonder', 'just', 'who', 'man', 'was', 'unlock', 'secrets', 'mothers', 'uncover', 'quite', 'bit', 'never', 'knew', 'mother.In', 'see', 'Ann', 'young', 'woman', 'played', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Ann', 'visiting', 'friends', 'wedding', 'best', 'friend', 'Lila', 'getting', 'married', 'be', 'maid', 'honor', 'Lila', 'brother', 'Buddy', 'making', 'grave', 'mistake', 'upon', 'Ann', 'talk', 'sister', 'wedding', 'Lila', 'parents', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'very', 'happy', 'daughter', 'choice', 'man', 'Harris', 'young', 'doctor', 'who', 'apple', 'just', 'everyone', 'eyes', 'Ann', 'immediately', 'smitten', 'Buddy', 'Lila', 'have', 'crushes', 'Harris', 'as', 'well', 'Buddy', 'insistent', 'Harris', 'whom', 'Lila', 'should', 'be', 'marrying', 'not', 'Carl.What', 'very', 'unfortunate', 'movie', 'rarely', 'anyone', 'cast', 'chance', 'truly', 'shine', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'decent', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'past', 'been', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'will', 'mention', 'fact', 'Danes', 'singing', 'film', 'think', 'then', 'amazing', 'voice', 'should', 'pursue', 'point', 'career', 'Aside', 'Danes', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'who', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'actually', 'best', 'actress', 'bunch', 'as', 'far', 'handling', 'material', 'well', 'far', 'award', 'worthy', 'best', 'show', 'Natasha', 'Richardson', 'decent', 'underused', 'Redgrave', 'mentioned', 'wasted', 'Streep', 'who', 'five', 'minutes', 'maybe', 'plastic', 'mannequin', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'floor', 'screaming', 'convincing', 'not', 'tad', 'top', 'Aside', 'vacant', 'Newcomer', 'Mamie', 'Gummer', 'Streep', 'daughter', 'decent', 'here', 'actually', 'promise', 'character', 'lost', 'expansive', 'cast', 'male', 'actors', 'film', 'are', 'here', 'provide', 'testosterone', 'alone', 'gather', 'Wilson', 'who', 'had', 'phenomenal', 'year', 'last', 'year', 'nothing', 'eye', 'candy', 'here', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'annoying', 'well', 'it.In', 'end', 'Evening', 'was', 'truly', 'waste', 'evening', 'part', 'was', ""n't"", 'dreadful', 'was', 'far', 'rewarding', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'ever', 'watching', 'film', 'again', 'really', 'recommending', 'sad', 'admitting', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'was', 'ever', 'mediocre', 'best', 'type', 'film', 'very', 'very', 'hard', 'thing', 'do']",N/A

1099101,A183HC5Z54FJFX,B000V6LSOA,April Kempler,"[3, 8]","While visually beautiful and appealing the movie plot did not match up in richness or depth. I actually read the book first by Susan Minot. I have some issue with the book, perhaps that is for a different review, and not this one.  Mainly my concerns involving the novel had to do with the writing style rather than content.  There were no quotations marks so it was never clearly defined for me who was saying what or was this the characters thought or was it actually said out loud. I believe that is a publishing issue.  Once I picked up the flow of the writers language and became immersed in the story it ceased to become too much of a problem. That is a true testiment to the writers gift of story telling. The story itself took on an energy of it's own and I found myself lost in the journey of Ann Grant's life and everyone she came in contact with through her short but highly packed lifetime. Once I had finished with the novel I was eager to see how it would be translated on film.Several times at the beginning of the movie I picked up the dvd case to make sure I had the correct movie. Each time it was confirmed, this was inspired from the book by Susan Minot. She even co-wrote the screenplay, so I was excited to see how she manipulated her thoughts into actions on the screen.  Suffice it to say I felt completely confused and let down. Some of the characters names were used but they bore little resemblence to their literary counterparts. Evening in film format did not resemble the novel in the least! It is completely wrong from the beginning and therefore completely without substance and truth to the themes of the novel.Spoiler Alert: Please read on if you don't mind my divulging some of the details, but if you haven't a.) read the book or b.) seen this movie yet, please do so then please come back and read my review.The way it is portrayed in the movie is a sweet older, very ill and dying woman thinks back to a turning point in her life that ended a budding affair and a dear friends life  I hope I don't spoil this for someone) what is missing from the movie is the energy, fire and passion that instantly sparks between Harris Arden and Ann.  From the movie point of view it is a wonder why she ever falls for him (or that anybody else does) at all.  The reasons why they can't be together are never answered, as well as all the complications that ensued at that wedding celebration weekend in Maine so many years before.  The novel was beautifully written with interweavings from past to present. Important plot manuevers are never explained in the movie and important individuals that add to a cohesive story line are eliminated altogether. If I hadn't read the book and just seen the movie then I would have thought, well that was interesting and it had really great costumes and sensational actors, but...I don't get it. And, having read the book and seen the movie I am disappointed and cheated. This could have been so great, instead it was just a mere shadow of itself and a stretched out and unrecognizable shadow at that.

1099111,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B000V6LSOA,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[2, 6]","Yes, it is visually beautiful . . . but, that's about it.The scenery alone in director Lajos Koltai's 2007 film, Evening, reminds one of a New Age CD cover art where appropriately filtered silhouettes and shadows suggest a romanticism that seems superfluous when analyzed within the actual content of a plot that seems like it could be a good idea, but never quite works.A bevy of world class performers headlines this chick-flick offering set confusingly in what seems to be the same house on the beach at Newport, past and present.  This doesn't make much sense as the doyenne of the tale, elderly and deathbed-ridden Anne played with typical Vanessa Redgrave magnificence and dominance, visits this locale to attend the wedding of her college girlfriend, Lila, years earlier in the late 1950s.  In a bewildering series of flashbacks and present day sequences, we watch the elder Anne crawl towards death with an excruciating slowness that allows some present-day storylines to come to light - daughters Toni Colette and Natasha Richardson wax eternal with regard to their own confused identities and hasten to make some sense out of their mother's mutterings about the mysterious megahunk Harris, one of the long-ago Newport residents and wedding guests.Why the elder Anne's morphine induced memories showcase the rather bland doctor remains a mystery to this reviewer---young Anne, played with a lanky awkwardness by Claire Danes seems utterly mesmerized by his flat two-dimensional presence as he grandiosely points at stars in the evening sky that he feels he has a right to hand out like gumdrops and lamely claims a-love-at-fist-sight possessiveness that begrudgingly follows some Prince Charming protocol.  However odd, the Harris character becomes the focal point of this film as every major player, from Anne, to blushing-bride Lila to alcoholic brother Buddy, crosses paths while loving him.  While actor Patrick Wilson plays him to the best of his ability, he does so oblivious to the character's apparent charm.  Overall, the lack of characterization gives little reason for such dogged devotion from such adoring fans.Curiously, the film does keep one interested.  I continued to watch to the very end, waiting for that Eureka moment that would explain Anne's deathbed fascination with a man she hadn't seen in over forty years.  Unfortunately, the film doesn't provide any answers even though it is packaged tightly with great visuals and great actors that whisper promises but never quite deliver.So what do I make of it?  If anything this film could be commenting on the glove-wearing panty-girdle stifled generation that came of age in the 50s. Glen Close as Lila's mother with her tightly bound hair and penciled eyebrows subtly rolls her eyes at her son's intoxication while simultaneously instructs her daughter on proper bride-to-be expectations.  As the burden of acting correctly within a certain standard reigns paramount, each of the characters must cope with their failure to maintain the right stereotype.  Individual quests for identity matter naught----the bride, Lila (played by Meryl Streep's daughter), resigns to marry a wealthy man she doesn't love; she knows there is little else but the matron's life to afford her credibility and satisfy her family's expectations.  Buddy's possible homosexuality places him in a dysfunctional world with which he is too sensitive to deal; it forces him to the bottle and an early death.  The heroine, Anne, may wear structured bohemian skirts and espadrilles from ""the Village"" but, she too struggles with her opposing desires of becoming a famous nightclub singer and opting for the expected life of wife and mother.  Forty years later, her lack of commitment to either has left her with a shallow life of doubt where thoughts of a one-night stand with Harris takes her back to that proverbial fork in the road still pregnant with possibility where she could have been a free spirit in Greenwich Village or just someone different from what she turned out to be.For all three of these characters, Harris becomes a symbol of the desire to overcome the shackles of this generation and reach out for something out of the ordinary that breaks the hum-drum tradition that will be ushered in with full force some ten years later with the student demonstrations of the 60s.Even though all of this could make marvelous sense, the film just doesn't quite convey this sense of unrequited passion and searing search for self-identity.  Instead confusion reigns; sequences between the nurse and the elder Anne invoke yawns rather than insight.  Anne's fascination with Harris after 40 years bores rather than titillates and the reunion scene in Manhattan a few years after the wedding seems wasted rather than validating.Bottom line?  I haven't read the book from which this movie is based, but if it is supposed to symbolize the frustration of the 50s generation and/or a devoid American culture in general, it just might be worth looking into.  Perhaps then a viewing of this movie would resonate with a little more empathy rather than just bewilderment.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",3,Evening Takes Itself too Seriously,1195516800,"11

1099113,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000V6LSOA,Ed Uyeshima,"[8, 12]","In hindsight, Gyula Pados' overly stylized cinematography should have been my first clue that this oversaturated 2007 soap opera would be a movie devoid of any realistic dimension, but little did I know this was going to be such a lugubrious slog to sit through as well. This is longtime cinematographer Lajos Koltai's second film as a director and his first American production, and unfortunately here he exposes a limited ability to convey story nuances and character complexity. Moreover, novelist Michael Cunningham (The Hours) has yet to show a particular affinity in adapting books to the screen (David Hare wrote the screenplay toThe Hours), and even collaborating with Susan Minot, the original author ofEvening, does little to bring the necessary depth of emotional resonance to her acclaimed 1999 novel. It's too bad all these factors compound each other because a stellar cast has been assembled, and except for a few key scenes, they are unfortunately presented like chess pieces on a postcard-pretty tableau.The time-spanning story concerns free spirited Ann Grant Lord at two points in her life, as a young woman in 1954 about to be the maid of honor at her best friend Lila Wittenborn's Newport society wedding and on her deathbed 45 years later with her two grown daughters tending to her. The film goes back and forth and adds fantasy elements in the contemporary story in order to have the older Ann visualize what could have been. The primary dynamic in the earlier story is Ann's innate resistance to fitting in among the resolute blue-bloods despite her unconditional affection for Lila and her ne'er-do-well brother Buddy. The pressure for conformity is felt more strongly by Lila who is marrying a man she doesn't really love. Her passion is directed at Harris, the strapping son of the family housekeeper who has since become a doctor. Buddy has the same kind of feelings toward Harris but can only reconcile them as a drunken bon vivant. Ann is also drawn to Harris, and naturally conflict and tragedy ensue. In the later story, Ann's daughters provide a study in contrasts, and how they respond to their mother's deterioration provides the impetus for the lesser of the two storylines. All the sentimentality in both stories is telegraphed in a manner both cloying in sensibility and patronizing to its audience. The film actually begs for a more Baroque-level approach by a director like Todd Haynes, who has shown he can mimic the overheated style of Douglas Sirk with 2002'sFar from Heaven.Both Claire Danes and Vanessa Redgrave do solid work playing Ann. The problem is that they never seem credible as the same person since their physical dissimilarity is compounded by the lack of consistency in their body movements and posture. There is a marked contrast between Danes' characteristic head-shaking gawkiness and Redgrave's more regal grace (even lying in bed). Wiser casting choices prevail elsewhere with an underused Natasha Richardson, Redgrave's real-life daughter, playing the older Ann's sensible daughter Constance and with Mamie Gummer and her mother Meryl Streep as Lila then and now. Streep's work consists of a small scene late in the film, but she manages to embrace the full scope of the character's history in her bedside recollections with Ann. It's nice to see two revered titans like Streep and Redgrave together, but the momentous encounter is over much too soon. Gummer, looking very much like a more pliable version of her mother, does what she can playing the regretful bride-to-be.With her trademark heart-on-her-sleeve dexterity, Toni Collette plays Ann's other daughter, perennially unhappy wild-child Nina, while Glenn Close is mainly on the sidelines in the minor role of Lila's highly affluent mother. Eileen Atkins is saddled with a restrictive role as the night nurse also serving as a silly plot device. The men fare less well with Hugh Dancy trying his best to bring texture to the woefully predictable character of Buddy and Patrick Wilson trying not to look embarrassed as everyone's object of desire, Harris. With Newmanesque &eacute;lan, Wilson certainly looks the part, but the script shortchanges his character by making him a shallow mythic figure. The 2007 DVD offers no commentary track, but it does offer a few deleted scenes and two shorts - the standard making-of featurette, ""One Weekend by the Sea: Remembering `Evening'"", which features most of the creative forces, including the principal actors, speaking in glowing terms about the filmmaking experience, and ""Adapting `Evening'"", which focuses more specifically on Cunningham and Minot's partnership in writing the screenplay.",2,A Strong Cast Set Adrift in a Quagmire of Clich&eacute;s in an Overlong Then-and-Now Soaper,1191024000,"09 29, 2007",2007,4659,"['hindsight', 'Gyula',

1099116,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000V6LSOA,Grady Harp,"[82, 84]","Criticism of the film EVENING, based on the novel by Susan Minot and adapted for the screen by Minot and Michael Cunningham, has been harsh, so harsh that it may have discouraged many viewers from giving the film a try. The primary criticism has centered on the fact that very little happens in this film about a dying woman's fretting over a mistake she made one summer in her youth, that famous actors were given very minor roles, that the entire production was over-hyped, etc.  For this viewer, seeing the film on a DVD in the quiet of the home, a very different reaction occurred.Ann Grant Lord (Vanessa Redgrave) is dying in her home by the ocean and her medication and memories allow her to share a man's name - 'Harris' - with her two grown daughters Nina (Toni Colette) and Constance (Natasha Richardson).  As her daughters sit at her bedside Ann relives a particular summer when she was a bridesmaid for her best friend Lila (Mamie Gummer) - a marriage both Ann (Claire Danes as the youthful Ann) and Lila's alcoholic brother Buddy (Hugh Dancy) objected to, feeling that Lila was simply marrying a man of her class instead of the boy she had loved - Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson), her housekeeper's son who had become a physician.  Harris, Buddy, Lila, and Ann are woven together in a series of infatuations and romances that have been kept secret until now, 50 years later, as Ann is dying.  The older Lila (Meryl Streep) visits Ann at the end and the secrets are revealed: 'there are no such things as mistakes - life just goes on.'The film is a delicate mood piece and the script by Minot and Cunningham is rich in atmosphere and subtle life lessons.  Yes, there are gaps in the story that could have used more explanation, but in order to maintain the aura of nostalgia of a dying lady's words, such 'holes' are understandable. The film is graced by the presence of not only Redgrave, Richardson (Redgrave's true daughter), Collette, Gummer (Streep's true daughter), Meryl Streep, Claire Danes, Eileen Atkins, Glenn Close, Hugh Dancy and Patrick Wilson, but also with an ensemble cast of brief but very solid performances. The setting is gorgeous (cinematography by Gyula Pados) and the musical score is by the inimitable Jan A.P. Kaczmarek.  Lajos Koltai (""Being Julia') directs.  Judge this film on your own....

1099117,A3SUUO4JQOQON4,B000V6LSOA,"I'd rather be at Pemberley! ""Cindy""","[3, 3]","I took a chance and rented this movie.  I am so glad I did, even though my eyes are red from crying and I am still choked up.A woman at the end of her life considers the choices she made throughout it, some freely, some perhaps forced by circumstance or perceived obligation.  She reviews the pursuit of her dreams, ambitions and love in the raw light of finality.She tantalizes her two daughters (played wonderfully and subtly by the late Natasha Richardson and Toni Collette) and the audience, as she sporadically remembers her life through the current haze of disease and pain killing drugs.  There are flashbacks to the past as the movie, through stunning cinematography, takes you back to the 50's.If you expect (or like) cookie cutter movies that explain everything for you, nice and neatly with hospital corners, this movie is NOT for you.  If you like movies that make you think and require some thoughtful insight, then you will LOVE this movie.  Each character does not present a birth certificate or an online profile of likes and dislikes so you can ""know"" them.  You must determine ""who"" they are by their ""actions.""  If you pay close attention, you will find each to be multi-leveled.Ann (Vanessa Redgrave) through her last hours on earth explores what she determines to be her mistakes in life.  I think that at the end of her journey, she realizes it's only a mistake if you come to regret it.She therefore determines ""there are no mistakes.""  Something to think about.I think much is exposed through the mother/daughters relationship.  In the end, perhaps, we don't realize that mothers (parents) are people, too, with their own dreams and wants.  I feel the daughters realize the sacrificial nature of parenting through the new revelations of their mothers incoherent state and come to appreciate their mother more.  It is difficult to realize that sometimes, and this movie, very quietly, touches on that point profoundly.I have read other reviews that critique the role of ""Harris,"" Ann's love interest in the film.  They are confused as to ""why is he such a big deal?""  But that's the point of his character.  At the end of her life, this is who she remembers.  Why?  Well, they don't spell it out for you. They show you glimpses of him, and mostly tell you about him through other people's opinions and interactions with him.It could be that she really loved him and through painful circumstances she opted not to pursue it.  So it was the one that got away.It could also be that because Ann had two failed marriages, her expectation of Harris grew and fulfilled something in her imagination (that was perfection for her 50 years, ago) that went unfulfilled in reality  This is why, I feel, they did not ""over develop"" the character of Harris.  I think we are to determine which option it is.  We are meant to think about how a person, at the end of her life, determines what to regret and why.It's a tear jerker, beautifully acted and filmed.  Hugh Dancy shows his acting talent with surprising profundity. He is really a stand out in this movie.  The entire cast is top notch.These types of thoughtful, thought-provoking films are RARE and debut to little POPULAR, blockbuster fanfare.  However, they are necessary and refreshing and should be enjoyed.",5,ITS ONLY A MISTAKE IF YOU REGRET IT.......,1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,3276,"['took', 'chance', 'rented', 'movie', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'even', 'eyes', 'are', 'red', 'crying', 'am', 'still', 'choked', 'up.A', 'woman', 'end', 'life', 'choices', 'made', 'freely', 'perhaps', 'forced', 'circumstance', 'perceived', 'obligation', 'pursuit', 'dreams', 'ambitions', 'love', 'raw', 'light', 'finality.She', 'two', 'daughters', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'subtly', 'late', 'Natasha', 'Richardson', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'audience', 'sporadically', 'life', 'current', 'haze', 'disease', 'pain', 'killing', 'drugs', 'are', 'flashbacks', 'past', 'movie', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'back', ""50's.If"", 'expect', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'movies', 'explain', 'everything', 'nice', 'neatly', 'hospital', 'corners', 'movie', 'NOT', 'like', 'movies', 'make', 'think', 'require', 'thoughtful', 'insight', 'then', 'will', 'LOVE', 'movie', 'character', 'not', 'present', 'birth', 'certificate', 'online', 'profile', 'likes', 'dislikes', 'can', 'know', 'must', 'determine', 'who', 'are', 'actions', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'will', 'find', 'be', 'multi-leveled.Ann', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'last', 'hours', 'earth', 'explores', 'what', 'be', 'mistakes', 'life', 'think', 'end', 'journey', 'only', 'mistake', 'come', 'regret', 'it.She', 'therefore', 'are', 'mistakes', 'Something', 'think', 'about.I', 'think', 'much', 'exposed', 'mother/daughters', 'relationship', 'end', 'perhaps', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'mothers', 'parents', 'are', 'people', 'too', 'own', 'dreams', 'feel', 'daughters', 'realize', 'sacrificial', 'nature', 'parenting', 'new', 'revelations', 'mothers', 'incoherent', 'state', 'come', 'appreciate', 'mother', 'more', 'difficult', 'realize', 'sometimes', 'movie', 'very', 'quietly', 'touches', 'point', 'profoundly.I', 'have', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'critique', 'role', 'Harris', 'Ann', 'love', 'interest', 'film', 'are', 'confused', 'why', 'big', 'deal', 'point', 'character', 'end', 'life', 'who', 'remembers', 'Why', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'spell', 'out', 'show', 'glimpses', 'mostly', 'tell', 'other', 'people', 'opinions', 'interactions', 'him.It', 'could', 'be', 'really', 'loved', 'painful', 'circumstances', 'opted', 'not', 'pursue', 'was', 'one', 'got', 'away.It', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'Ann', 'had', 'two', 'failed', 'marriages', 'expectation', 'Harris', 'grew', 'fulfilled', 'something', 'imagination', 'was', 'perfection', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'went', 'unfulfilled', 'reality', 'why', 'feel', 'did', 'not', 'develop', 'character', 'Harris', 'think', 'are', 'determine', 'option', 'are', 'meant', 'think', 'how', 'person', 'end', 'life', 'what', 'regret', 'why.It', 'tear', 'jerker', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'filmed', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'acting', 'talent', 'surprising', 'profundity', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'movie', 'entire', 'cast', 'top', 'notch.These', 'types', 'thoughtful', 'thought-provoking', 'films', 'are', 'RARE', 'debut', 'little', 'POPULAR', 'blockbuster', 'fanfare', 'However', 'are', 'necessary', 'refreshing', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyed']",N/A
1099118,A28HO8AE8GPUIY,B000V6LSOA,J. B. Pritchard,"[3, 5]","Pros:+ Standout acting performances.+ An interesting message.+ Realistic little life moments.Cons:- The pacing feels off.- The daughters' storylines are not interesting.- Too abstract at times.Evening is a film about one woman's death bed remembrances of a weekend and a lover that affected her profoundly.  The old woman, Ann, gives her daughters the name ""Harris"" and then the film goes into a series of memories and misgivings about the course that her life took.  Evening certainly has its weak points.  At times, the story seems stalled and you'll spend quite some time wondering when it is going to get to the POINT and tell us what significance Harris played in Ann's life.  The storylines of the two daughters which the film spends some time on also fall a little bit flat and are generally under developed.  Another flaw is the tendency to show Ann's dreams and hallucinations such as seeing her nurse in a white evening dress which add little to the plot and feel like fruitless attempts to be abstract and deep.In the end, however, the movie succeeds despite these draw backs, largely due to the acting.  Each actor delivers an incredible performance which allows even the smallest line or facial expression to convey an incredible amount of meaning.  The film is also refreshing in that it does not come to any definite conclusions -- life is made up of little moments and there are no mistakes, only the good moments and the bad moments.",4,"Struggles for fluidity, but the acting saves it",1195171200,"11 16, 2007",2007,1450,"['Pros', '+', 'acting', 'performances.+', 'interesting', 'message.+', 'Realistic', 'little', 'life', 'moments.Cons', 'pacing', 'off.-', 'daughters', 'storylines', 'are', 'not', 'interesting.-', 'Too', 'abstract', 'times.Evening', 'film', 'one', 'woman', 'death', 'bed', 'remembrances', 'weekend', 'lover', 'affected', 'profoundly', 'old', 'woman', 'Ann', 'daughters', 'name', 'Harris', 'then', 'film', 'series', 'memories', 'misgivings', 'course', 'life', 'took', 'Evening', 'certainly', 'weak', 'points', 'times', 'story', 'stalled', ""'ll"", 'spend', 'quite', 'time', 'wondering', 'when', 'going', 'get', 'POINT', 'tell', 'significance', 'Harris', 'played', 'Ann', 'life', 'storylines', 'two', 'daughters', 'film', 'time', 'also', 'fall', 'little', 'bit', 'flat', 'are', 'generally', 'developed', 'flaw', 'tendency', 'show', 'Ann', 'dreams', 'hallucinations', 'such', 'seeing', 'nurse', 'white', 'evening', 'dress', 'little', 'plot', 'feel', 'fruitless', 'attempts', 'be', 'abstract', 'end', 'however', 'movie', 'draw', 'backs', 'largely', 'due', 'acting', 'actor', 'incredible', 'performance', 'even', 'smallest', 'line', 'facial', 'expression', 'convey', 'incredible', 'amount', 'meaning', 'film', 'also', 'refreshing', 'not', 'come', 'definite', 'conclusions', 'life', 'made', 'little', 'moments', 'are', 'mistakes', 'only', 'good', 'moments', 'bad', 'moments']",N/A

Do you love the exploration of character and delving into human relationships? Dysfunction adds to the mix, and the horrified entertainment for the viewer who, from the easy chair, urges the characters, ""No, don't do that..."" If this sounds appealing, then you are likely to find much to chew on in this film.The story is a great character study between generations, as well. An added bonus is the tiny moments of healing for characters as they begin to understand each other.

I went into this film with the highest of expectations. I was not disappointed with any of the acting as it is uniformly superb (surprisingly most from Hugh Dancy in a ""Greek Chorus"" commentary performance that I found truly touching!).Oscar nods for acting would not surprise me in the least for a number of these fine professionals! I was charmed and lulled with Jan A.P. Kaczmerak's hauntingly poignant original soundtrack. The camera shots are beautiful. The set design and costumes are appropriately period.I will probably remember much of what I saw and mull it over in the coming years.I truly wanted to be bowled over by this film, but I left the theatre feeling flat, confused and unfulfilled. The shifting back and forth between the time frames was not at all a problem (I was already comfortable with THE HOURS and THE NOTEBOOK and YA-YA) so that wasn't it.My conclusion was that the screenplay just simply didn't come together in a way that made me feel or identify with the characters. I felt that the entire film left loose ends dangling and that each character was not developed enough for me to feel as though I knew and understood their longings, fears, motivations and angst.There are so many unanswered questions in this screenplay that seemed to never have any explanation or resolution. (There is one glaring continuity error concerning Buddy and Anne's College days  that those of us who saw it questioned how the script supervisor could have missed it!) The movie seemed to try to be deeper than it really was, and that much ado was made about nothing. If this film is about life's regrets and missed chances, mother-daughter relationships, women's limited choices in the 1950's and the folly and  ""caste"" system of the New England wealthy then I have definitely seen all of that done better and far more effectively elsewhere.My closing remark is WHY WOULD ANYONE HAVE OBSESSED OVER HARRIS ARDEN???? The character was so underdeveloped that apart from being a good looking Patrick Wilson, WHAT WAS THIS CHARACTER'S ALLURE?I really feel bad that 3 1/2 stars is the best I can do for EVENING.

1099127,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000V6LSOA,Lee Armstrong,"[6, 9]","""Evening"" entranced me from the first frame to the last.  I found it an exquisite film about how memory and the experience of a life well lived flickers during a person's final days of earthly sojourn.  The interweaving between past & present in Ann's mind, the questions her comments raise in her daughters, how children and parents love each other deeply while also being totally immersed in their own lives all rang with the voice of experience.  Susan Minot is screenwriter based on her novel along with Michael Cunningham who worked on ""The Hours.""This is an amazing group of talent that came together for this project.  Between cast & production, they collectively have earned at least 5 Oscars and 32 Oscar nominations for their lifetime work.  Hungarian director Lajos Koltai directs his second feature followingFateless.  For years, he worked as a cinematographer that earned a Best Cinematography Oscar nomination for ""Malena"" in 2000.  Gyula Pados who worked with Koltai on his previous directorial project serves as cinematographer here with stunning visual results.  The present is cluttered & dowdy, but the past is elegant & beautiful.  It seems just the way our minds would remember a more beautiful past.  Jan A. P. Kaczmarek who won an Oscar for Best Score forFinding Neverland (Widescreen Edition)in 2004 does another outstanding job with the lovely score for this film.  Allyson C. Johnson edits effectively, crosscutting between present & past in the film and never lingers overly long.  Ann Roth costumed the film with Michelle Matland who had done ""Freedomland.""  Roth earned her Best Costume Oscar for ""The English Patient"" with nominations for ""The Hours,"" ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" & ""Places in the Heart.""  From the casual present to the elegant balls of the past, the costumes lend elegance to the actors.The cast totally delivers as we see a pairing of generations.  Natasha Richardson who was inBlow Dry& ""Maid in Manhattan"" and is the real-life daughter of Vanessa Redgrave plays Constance.  She is the earthy, successful & practical daughter who waits bedside to assist her mother.  Toni Collette who was nominated for an Oscar for ""The Sixth Sense"" in 1999 plays Nina, the wild daughter who seems too restless to settle down.  The sisters bicker but ultimately love each other.  Patrick Wilson who looks incredibly like Paul Newman and bared his bottom for ""Little Children"" plays Harris Arden, the guy who is so good looking, responsible and sensitive that he flutters the hearts of Ann & Lila.  Young Lila is getting married, which causes all to gather for the most important evening of Ann's life.  In her first film, Mamie Gummer (aka ""Meryl Streep Jr."") plays the young Lila who is in love with Harris, but set to marry a more boring guy.  Gummer does a great job, frequently reminding us of some of her mother's mannerisms.  She flutters between the joyful bride to an acute case of cold feet.  Claire Danes, who won the Golden Globe in 1993 for the TV series ""My So-Called Life"" and has been in films as diverse as Steve Martin'sShopgirlto ""Terminator 3,"" plays young Ann.  While there may not be the greatest physical resemblance between Redgrave & Danes, Claire captures the free spirit and artistic temperament that dares to dream.  Hugh Dancey delivers a blockbuster performance as the unstable young Buddy, Lila's brother.  Dancey was nominated for an Emmy for ""Elizabeth I"" & has appeared in ""Blood & Chocolate,"" ""Ella Enchanted"" & ""King Arthur.""  As Buddy Wittenborn, he is the rich kid who seems troubled and unhappy while trying to display a carefree playboy image.  His errant kiss apparently sends him over the emotional edge.  Glenn Close plays Mrs. Wittenborn, the socialite mother of the bride who tries to maintain complete control.  Close has been nominated five times for Oscar for ""The World According to Garp,"" ""The Big Chill,"" ""The Natural,"" ""Fatal Attraction"" & ""Dangerous Liaisons.""  Her breakdown scene is short but riveting.  Vanessa Redgrave won her Oscar for ""Julia"" in 1977 and has been nominated five other times from ""Morgan"" in 1966 to ""Howard's End"" in 1992.  She plays the deathbed Ann as emotionally lucid despite a mind that is reviewing her life.  It is an excellent performance.  Near the end of the film, Meryl Streep who won Oscars for ""Sophie's Choice"" & ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" with a total of 14 nominations shows up as the older Lila to say goodbye to her friend.  The scene is brief, punctuated by memory, but in each's eyes you can see worlds of experience.  Eileen Atkins from ""Cold Mountain,"" ""The Hours,"" & ""Gosford Park"" plays the night nurse.  Tony-award winner Barry Bostwick plays Glenn Close's husband.  Together, these actors create an awesome ensemble.I read some of the negative reviews and understand their points of view.  But my experience of the film was that it was a breath of fresh air.  In a typical summer of action pictures, this film is a delight because it celebrates the human experience in a very real way.  Yes, most things in life will show up on film in different times and places, but ""Evening"" assembles its story and tells it originally & compellingly.

Like The Hours, Evening deals in lost dreams and thwarted hopes, unfulfilled loves and a kind of resigned endurance.  You can see what drew novelist Cunningham to this as his first screenplay, an adaptation of Susan Minot's novel, co-written with Ms. Minot.  A superb cast, however (including Meryl Streep for three or four scenes) can't make Evening as coherent and affecting as The Hours, Cunningham's novel adapted by David Hare.  Despite its rambling length - with much emotional repetition - the plot has major holes and fails to convince us that these people are any more than their own worst enemies.  As often happens when past and present are intercut, the past is lively and engaging, the present, which is mostly reflection on what went wrong, becomes rather tedious.

Claire Danes plays the young ""Ann"" during a weekend in 1953 when she is the Maid of Honor at her best friend's wedding. There she meets a man, Harris, with whom she unexpectedly falls in love. Their moments together--what ultimately only seem like moments in a very long life--are romantic and memorable, and they forever have stars in the sky to remind them of one another after they travel separate paths through adulthood. For the aged Ann (played by Vanessa Redgrave), Harris was the one that got away.Ann's adult daughters, (Toni Collette and Natasha Richardson) keeping vigil at her deathbed, clearly love their mother and were clearly loved by her. The daughters each face their own (relatively mundane) struggles, but struggles nonetheless, and want very much for their mother to provide the answers and continue to show them the way toward fulfillment.This is a beautiful movie, and I recommend especially for mothers, daughters, sisters and best friends.

The ups and downs of the character relationships ultimately guide them to their destiny...both the happy times and the sad.  I enjoyed this film for both the scenic and artistic beauty but also the deep bond of the characters.  It was nice to see relationships grow rather than stay stagnant. Looking at a couple of the deleted scenes, I would have preferred that at least one of them be left in as I think a couple elements got choppy without them.  For some, the flash backs between past and present can be confusing. Overall though I consider it a great movie when thinking about those relationships that matter from that of mother/daughter, friends like sisters, and romantic love.  I think it is one of those types of stories that you can identify with more than one of the characters by the different situations and emotions they find themselves.  It's only the smoothness of the story that I detract a star as I think there are some movies better on both character development and story telling.  I did experience a glitch in the hd dvd picture/sound during the wedding reception scene where both the picture and sound disappeared...and only the picture corrected itself.

I thought it was wonderfully sentimental, and I enjoyed watching it.Ann (Vanessa Redgrave/Claire Danes) is on her deathbed, reflecting on some of the defining moments of her life. Her two daughters, Connie (Natasha Richardson) and Nina (Toni Collette), grapple with the complications of their own lives and the idea of their mother's passing.In her waning moments, Ann primarily dwells on a single weekend in her life, when she serves as the maid of honor at her friend Lila's (Mamie Gummer/Meryl Streep) wedding. During the weekend, Ann meets Harris (Patrick Wilson), whom she falls in love with and never truly forgets. However, due to a tragic accident during the wedding weekend (and relationships they share with others), Ann and Harris do not end up together. They both marry, have children, and lead separate lives. And as she is preparing to leave this world, Ann wonders if not being with Harris (and not pursuing her dream of becoming a professional singer more devotedly) is the biggest mistake of her life.As the story continues, the viewer begins to see that maybe there ARE no mistakes in life. Only choices, the choices that make us who we are and shape our experience. (This reminded me much of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. If you go around trying to change what you've done or erase what you think you shouldn't have done, you are not going to be the same person. You won't know the same things, feel the same things, learn the same things.) Maybe the only thing we can do, upon reflecting, is be as satisfied as we can be that we are the sum of the choices we've made.At any rate, the film is beautifully written, gloriously performed, and lovely to look at. It will make you think a bit, too.

Directed by Lajos Koltai (of ""Being Julia"" and ""Sunshine"" fame) and co-written by Michael Cunningham (he of ""The Hours""), you'd be forgiven for expecting very great things indeed from ""Evening"".I've not read the book, so I'm not biased one way or another, and I can honestly tell you that, rather than allowing itself to be what's so clearly the natural state of this story - a finely-wrought balance of human relationships making for a complex study of love and regret - ""Evening"" instead takes a wrong turn in the direction of Art House and winds up ultimately being chintzy and shallow, with little to reward the viewer.Sure, the performances are great, the dialogue is believable, and the action is nicely paced, but none of these things can save ""Evening"" from itself. Case in point: we've come from a scene where Nina (Collette) has confided in hypercritical big sister Constance (Richardson) that she's pregnant, scared and lacking direction. And then their infirm, on-her-deathbed mother (Redgrave) starts chasing after a CG moth, downstairs, through the kitchen, past her daughters and out into the street.What?There's lots of these little misplaced ""artsy"" touches in ""Evening"", and none of them works - the night nurse in evening wear, Doctor Harris at Ann's bedroom door, and so on - they are confusing and irritating in their self-importance, and, coupled with the languid, performance-focused nature of the rest of the movie, sever our connection with the altogether more interesting goings-on in the flashback scenes.And sadly, it's this disparity of timelines and overblown cinematography (REALLY BRIGHT colours for the past when Ann was young, muted greys and browns for the present now that she's dying, and other such cheap shots) that spoiled ""Evening"" for me.

Zwick,"[3, 4]","A stellar cast, consisting of Vanessa Redgrave, Claire Danes, Toni Collette, Natasha Richardson, Glenn Close and Meryl Streep,  is reason enough for watching ""Evening,"" one of those high-toned, slightly stuffy, intergenerational family dramas that is all about lost loves, wasted lives and missed opportunities, this time among the champagne-sipping elite of Newport, Rhode island.Redgrave stars as Ann Grant, a terminally ill woman whose dementia is leading her to reveal secrets on her deathbed that have been locked away in her memory for years.  Collette and Richardson play her two adult daughters who are able to glean only a few tantalizing nuggets about their mother`s past as they emerge randomly and still partially obscured from the fog of her delirium.  These scenes set in the present are intercut with those from the past, the 1950's in fact, when a young Ann (now played by Danes) fell in love with Harris (Patrick Wilson), the servant of her best friend, Lila (Mamie Gummer, who looks for all the world like a young Meryl Streep, who indeed steps in as Lila for the present scenes).  Lila also happens to be in love with Harris, but she is instead marrying Karl (Timothy Kiefler), mainly because his aristocratic pedigree mixes better with her family's blue blood (echoes of the much-better ""Atonement"" abound throughout).  Further complicating matters is Lila's kid brother, Buddy (Hugh Dancy), who appears to be in love with both Ann and Harris at one and the same time.Needless to say, much of this plays like a tony, high-class soap opera, but at least two of the characters manage to rise above the suds and fully engage our interest:  Colette's Nina, whose paralyzing fear of commitment and of making life-altering mistakes threatens to leave her a bitter, lonely woman; and Dancy`s Buddy, whose conflicted sexuality brings an unforeseen complexity and depth to the character.  Most of the rest of the characters are considerably less interesting, including Ann (both the one in the present and the one in the past) whose personal revelations are supposed to be the glue holding this overpopulated story together.  Harris is a particularly bland and uncharismatic figure for a man who is supposed to be such an irresistible magnetic attraction for at least three of the principal characters in the story.The burden of transferring Susan Manot's novel to the screen has fallen on the shoulders of director Lajos Koltai, whose metier seems to consist primarily of pretty landscapes, dusky lighting and tinkling pianos.  And yet, amid all the soap opera trappings, the movie has some important things to say about not just letting go of the past but of having the courage to move into the future.""Evening"" is decidedly a mixed bag as far as moviemaking and drama go, but the powerhouse performances (particularly by Collette, Richardson, Redgrave and Dancy) make for worthwhile viewing.",3,a mixed bag but with some fine performances,1215216000,"07 5, 2008",2008,2905,"['stellar', 'cast', 'consisting', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Natasha', 'Richardson', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'reason', 'enough', 'watching', 'Evening', 'one', 'high-toned', 'slightly', 'stuffy', 'intergenerational', 'family', 'dramas', 'lost', 'loves', 'wasted', 'lives', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'time', 'champagne-sipping', 'elite', 'Newport', 'Rhode', 'island.Redgrave', 'stars', 'Ann', 'Grant', 'terminally', 'ill', 'woman', 'dementia', 'leading', 'reveal', 'secrets', 'deathbed', 'have', 'been', 'locked', 'away', 'memory', 'years', 'Collette', 'Richardson', 'play', 'two', 'adult', 'daughters', 'who', 'are', 'able', 'glean', 'only', 'few', 'tantalizing', 'nuggets', 'mother', 's', 'past', 'emerge', 'randomly', 'still', 'partially', 'obscured', 'fog', 'delirium', 'scenes', 'set', 'present', 'are', 'intercut', 'past', '1950', 'fact', 'when', 'young', 'Ann', 'now', 'played', 'Danes', 'fell', 'love', 'Harris', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'servant', 'best', 'friend', 'Lila', 'Mamie', 'Gummer', 'who', 'world', 'young', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'who', 'indeed', 'steps', 'Lila', 'present', 'scenes', 'Lila', 'also', 'be', 'love', 'Harris', 'instead', 'marrying', 'Karl', 'Timothy', 'Kiefler', 'mainly', 'aristocratic', 'pedigree', 'mixes', 'better', 'family', 'blue', 'blood', 'echoes', 'much-better', 'Atonement', 'abound', 'Further', 'complicating', 'matters', 'Lila', 'kid', 'brother', 'Buddy', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'who', 'be', 'love', 'Ann', 'Harris', 'one', 'same', 'time.Needless', 'say', 'much', 'plays', 'tony', 'high-class', 'soap', 'opera', 'least', 'two', 'characters', 'manage', 'rise', 'suds', 'fully', 'engage', 'interest', 'Colette', 'Nina', 'paralyzing', 'fear', 'commitment', 'making', 'life-altering', 'mistakes', 'threatens', 'leave', 'bitter', 'lonely', 'woman', 'Dancy', 's', 'Buddy', 'conflicted', 'sexuality', 'unforeseen', 'complexity', 'depth', 'character', 'Most', 'rest', 'characters', 'are', 'considerably', 'less', 'interesting', 'including', 'Ann', 'one', 'present', 'one', 'past', 'personal', 'revelations', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'glue', 'holding', 'overpopulated', 'story', 'together', 'Harris', 'particularly', 'bland', 'uncharismatic', 'figure', 'man', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'such', 'irresistible', 'magnetic', 'attraction', 'least', 'three', 'principal', 'characters', 'story.The', 'burden', 'transferring', 'Susan', 'Manot', 'novel', 'screen', 'fallen', 'shoulders', 'director', 'Lajos', 'Koltai', 'metier', 'consist', 'primarily', 'pretty', 'landscapes', 'dusky', 'lighting', 'tinkling', 'pianos', 'yet', 'soap', 'opera', 'trappings', 'movie', 'important', 'things', 'say', 'not', 'just', 'letting', 'go', 'past', 'having', 'courage', 'move', 'future', 'Evening', 'decidedly', 'mixed', 'bag', 'as', 'far', 'moviemaking', 'drama', 'go', 'powerhouse', 'performances', 'particularly', 'Collette', 'Richardson', 'Redgrave', 'Dancy', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'viewing']",N/A

I watched this film because when I saw the trailer in the theatre it looked so good. Vanessa Redgrave one of my favorite actors is in it and I wanted to see her performance which is superb and very moving- the best performance in the movie. Her and Meryl Streep as the elder Lila Ross together were wonderful. I think Streep's daughter is a good actor and showed the conflict that women of that time faced. They didn't have a lot of choices.I would have liked the film to develop the characters and the story more. In Ann Lord's flashbacks I would have liked to have gotten to know them more. I do not see what was so great about Harris Arden. His character to me was kind of stiff. I think that the flashbacks dragged on too long and by cutting things out could have beefed up the story and made it with more substance. I would have put in more scenes of the elderly Ann with her daughters.I liked the message of the movie which was in life there are so many moments and that the mistakes we think we make are part of it and things happen for a reason. We can;t let one encounter or regret shape our life. I think also that we do the best we can and do what we need to do. There are times when we will be really happy or unhappy. It was very poignant when the elderly Ann tells her daughter to try to be happy and not be afraid. You can see the love that she had for both of them. The ending was I think effective when they showed the darkening of the sky and the daughters going up to be with Ann in her final moments.

1099151,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,B000V6LSOA,The Man in the Hathaway Shirt,"[2, 6]","I was looking forward to this film when first announcements were made. An all-star cast, a screenplay adapted by Michael Cunningham, whose work on The Hours I admire. (I admit I am unfamiliar with the work of Susan Minot, who wrote the book.) So what happens when you put all these sure-fire ingredients in a pot and set to boil?Sadly, not much.Evening is the flattest two hours I've been through in a while. We spend our time with a rather boring woman who chews her pillowcase while dying and takes forever to shuffle off.  (I had this image of her two daughters downstairs mixing cyanide into her medicine to speed things along.) While she's dying she flashes back to one weekend in her life, a weekend that, all in all, is pretty ordinary. If this is what she flashes back to as her greatest moments on earth, she must have had a dull life. Did she ever do anything *really* exciting, like order pizza?Evening is supposed to be tinged with regret and sadness and all that weepy stuff. Fair enough, but we never really understand why all the regret, why Harris (Patrick Wilson) was her only love, or why that one weekend in her life stayed with her forever. Sure, they're telling us she made the wrong choice, but we don't really see why he was the right choice.  Of course, late in the film we get the almost obligatory scene where they meet up years later, each has settled down to apparently tepid marriages, and they still harbor desire for each other. (""I still remember which stars are ours! And hey, I just named Sputnik after you, too!"") To add corn to the cob, he mentions that his new son is named--got your kleenex ready?--Buddy!  Claire Danes can play these kinds of scenes so well there ought to be a special Academy Award just for her. But despite her Herculean efforts, and the fine acting by her costar and Gap khaki conspirator Patrick Wilson, the moment is so clich&eacute;d it nearly degenerates into self-parody.The film is much too checkerboarded. There are too many pointless flashbacks and flash-forwards. You should not go back and forth unless you have a reason to interrupt the story flow, but time after time when we change times, nothing new has happened since the last time we left. Particularly with the Redgrave scenes, she just lies on the bed, mutters something linking to the past, and we flash back there. So why did we bother to come back to the present in the first place?The interwoven story of the contemporary daughters, played by Toni Collette and Miranda Richardson, is heavy-handed. Oh yes, restless Collette is urged by mommy not to repeat her mistakes and to ""try to be happy!"" Boo-hoo. The other daughter...well, what the heck *does* the other daughter do? Nothing, really. She doesn't even talk to her dying mother much.And then there's Hugh Dancy, as Buddy, who was only a minor character in the book but who is made a major player in the screenplay. Despite having his part lengthened, the writers didn't give him much depth. He comes on as the classic slacker, and it's quickly established that his best friend is Jack Daniels. He spends most of his time on screen getting drunk, and the filmmakers telegraph his eventual fate with semaphores. He too has the hots for Ann. (All the guys in this movie have the hots for Ann; all the chicks have the hots for Harris, except that Buddy also seems to have the hots for Harris. It plays like an episode of ""Soap."") Yet we really don't get why. Ann is very sweet and kind to him early on, seemingly wanting to rekindle something old. Yet when he finally reveals his feelings for her, she explodes at him and tells him to get a life. It's one of those Dramatic Moments that's completely unearned; it seems to come from nowhere, and instead of being emotionally-moved we are just left puzzled. (The other male lead is equally shallow: what is so special about Harris? As played by Patrick Wilson, he's stiff and charmless and not even especially handsome, yet we're supposed to see him as a chick magnet. The story never bothers to show why. Explaining the motivation of any of these characters seems beneath it.  They want our tears without earning them.)Also puzzling to me is the scene where Ann sings after the wedding. In the middle, uninvited and unasked, Harris gets up, climbs onstage and joins her, turning her solo that she's been rehearsing all week into a duet. Maybe the filmmakers thought this was somehow tender or an indication of how they belonged together; me, I thought it was obnoxious. This wasn't open mike night, and nobody asked him to sing. Maybe if afterwards he'd told her how wonderful she'd been, if he seemed to appreciate her in ways the others hadn't, it would have played better.Evening smacks of trying to be about more than it was. It has this feeling of a deep and profound secret, but it never comes. We keep waiting for the magic moment to tie it all together, but we never get one.The best thing about the movie is Danes. I type that so often in movies she is in that I ought to install a macro on my computer. Claire Danes can make my eyes tear...just by being Claire Danes. I don't know how she does it, but for just one example, there's a scene near the end of her cooking and trying to be a 50's domestic housewife that, for some reason I can't explain, really got to me. If some other actress played the part, it wouldn't have worked. Why, I don't know, except to say there's something very pure and very real that she manages to telegraph. The producers say she was the first person they thought of when they set about casting. They were smart to do so.The rest of the cast does well, too, but they can't hide the fact that Evening--the film at least; can't comment on the novel--really isn't about much.  But it thinks it's about a lot. And it takes its sweet time telling it.The DVD transfer looks beautiful. The location for this movie is breathtaking, and filmmakers milk it for all its worth, with no shortage of vivid colors and pastel sunsets. The two bonus featurettes are of the kissy-kissy ""I'm-working-with-the-most-talented-people-in-the-world"" variety.",2,Just. Die.

1099152,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000V6LSOA,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[9, 13]","""Evening"" is a chick flick. Let's get that out of the way right away. You will be hard pressed to find any straight guys gathering together to see ""Evening"" at the local multiplex. The only straight guys that will be in then theater for this film are the husbands, friends and boyfriends of the women who want to see this movie.But I think the term `chick flick' doesn't even begin to paint the whole picture. ""Evening"" is a beautifully photographed, well-written film starring some of the best actresses of a couple of generations. Anyone who appreciates well-made films should seek this out, whether they are female, male, straight or otherwise. But I have a feeling that no matter how much I try to convince you otherwise, if you are intent on seeing ""Die Hard 4"", you probably aren't interested in also watching ""Evening"". Right? Or am I the only freak out there? (See my review of ""Live Free or Die Hard"" to discover how much of a freak I am).Ann (Claire Danes) arrives at the Providence estate of her best friend, Lila (Mamie Gummer, Meryl Streep's daughter); to serve as Maid of Honor for her friend's wedding. Flash forward fifty years and Ann (Vanessa Redgrave) is on her death bed and telling confusing stories of that weekend fifty years before, confusing her grown daughters, Constance (Natasha Richardson, Vanessa Redgrave's daughter) and Nina (Toni Collette). As the daughters try to help their mother rest peacefully, they try to come to terms with their own relationships, both with their mother and with each other. The night nurse (Eileen Atkins) helps Ann deal with the pain, but also serves as a sort of guide to the magical, fateful events so many summers ago. As soon as Ann arrives for the wedding, Buddy (Hugh Dancy), Lila's alcoholic brother, asks Ann to help him stop the wedding. Lila doesn't love her fianc&eacute;e and should really marry Harris (Patrick Wilson), the son of a former housekeeper. But Lila realizes she must go through with the marriage because her mother (Glenn Close) would have a fit. As Ann and Harris get to know each other, they begin to fall in love, much to both Buddy and Lila's dismay. Many years later, Lila (Meryl Streep) visits Ann on her death bed to provide her with some comfort before her friend passes away.""Evening"", directed by Lajos Koltai (a cinematographer who has worked on many, many Hollywood films) and written by Michael Cunningham (""The Hours"") and Susan Minot, based on her novel of the same name, is a well-made film exploring the `mistakes' a couple of women make and how these mistakes effect the rest of their lives.The multigenerational story is told through a series of flashbacks and flash-forwards. Beginning with Redgrave, as Ann, on her deathbed, we see some of her memories and this seems to be the binding thread to the narrative. As Ann floats in and out of consciousness, she remembers various snippets of this big moment in her life. After this rhythm is established, we realize we are going to watch various moments, told in a pretty free flowing pattern. Yet, the moments from the past are told in chronological order and seem complete, so it is less confusing than it may seem from my description. But these moments are highlights of this event, and some of the connecting bits are left out, some of the less important moments which seem lost to Redgrave's character's memory.Basically, the story tells of two different events in these character's lives. Lila's wedding was a big event for everyone involved. One woman marries a man she doesn't love, one woman falls in love with another man and an event causes them to remain apart. There is a lot more at work in this story, but this is the gist of it. In the modern day story, Ann's pain medicine causes her to fall in and out of consciousness. In these moments, she talks with her night nurse (Atkins), who at times is a nurse and at others, seems to be a sort of guide into the other world, helping her keep her thoughts and memories as clear as possible. In these moments, her ramblings also cause her daughters (Richardson and Collette) to ask questions about their mother and about their own lives and to make some decisions.The story is multilayered and shifts back and forth, seemingly at whim, but it is very easy to follow.The cast for this film is fantastic. Many of the best actresses of three generations are apart of this film, along with two up and coming actors. I know the film is getting some negative reviews and I think perhaps they are letting their expectations get ahead of them. Any film with this cast has to be good, and I think the expectations for this film are high, maybe too high. ""Evening"" is a very good film. But with a cast like this, many clearly expect it to be a great film. It isn't a great film.Claire Danes is very good as Ann. As soon as she arrives at the estate of her friend, we get that she is a `free spirit'. She is wearing clothes she found at some shop in the `village'. Naturally, Lila's rich friends assume Anne is talking about a village in Africa or something, but Anne is from New York and is talking about Greenwich Village. More to her credit, she doesn't really care what they think about her, or her clothes. She is there to support her friend, Lila, and her brother, Buddy (Dancy).Ann quickly suspects something is wrong; Buddy pleads with her to stop the wedding and Ann finds Lila crying on more than one occasion. She quickly learns Harris (Wilson) is the problem. Lila is in love with him, whether she will admit it or not, and as he is the son of a former housekeeper, she can't marry him. Buddy is also a raging alcoholic and everyone tries to control it, taking away his champagne bottles, but Buddy is a grown boy and manages to get through the barriers his family and friends set-up. As Ann gets to know Harris, they become attracted to one another, and Lila and Buddy realize this, setting off a chain of events that will all but guarantee Ann and Harris never get together.Throughout, Danes portrays Ann as a free spirit, yet a caring young woman. Sure, she makes mistakes, but she recognizes when there is a problem and tries to correct it. But these events seem to stamp the rest of her life. We see brief glimpses of a couple of moments later in her life and they don't seem to be especially happy.But then, as we watch Ann, as played by Redgrave, we get the sense despite some occasional unhappy moments, she is, overall, very pleased with her life. Redgrave is such an accomplished actress that she can make even a character who is laying in bed for the entire film seem real and interesting and, in a way, lively. Ann is on pain killers so she has lucid moments when she seems more lively and involved in the lives of her daughters and the memories she is living through. When the pain killers take over, she has moments that are more dreamlike; her night nurse appears in a beautiful dress straight out of the 50s. It is a great performance and really helps to make Ann seem more real and more human.Mamie Gummer, Meryl Streep's daughter, plays Lila in the 50s. It is actually a bit freakish to watch her because she is the spitting image of her mother and even sounds just like her. Her role is a bit difficult to identify with, she is marrying the `right type of man' rather than the man she really loves. I think this is a difficult concept for us to understand as this is, hopefully, not something that is really practiced these days. Because she seems so upset about getting married to this man, we don't really understand why she doesn't just marry Harris. Then, later, when Meryl Streep takes over the role, Streep makes Lila come alive. Streep has one extended scene in the film, but it is a memorable one. As she talks with her old friend, lying together with her in bed, we finally start to see some of the thinking behind this decision made so many years ago.Toni Collette plays Ann's younger daughter, and the daughter with the most problems. Throughout the film, she has to come to terms with her relationship with her mother, her older sister (Richardson) and her boyfriend. As her mom's story begins to come into focus, and she realizes her mom did love them, and care for them, she makes some decisions which seem as though they will change her life for the better.Strangely, the two daughters of other actresses in the film come off the weakest. Gummer is good, but it isn't until her mom takes over the role that we really begin to connect with it. And Richardson seems merely bitter or pissed off throughout.Glenn Close plays Lila's mother, a wealthy woman who probably also married for the wrong reasons. In her few scenes, her character is interesting, but the role is too small to allow her to do anything monumental with it.Patrick Wilson, who made a splash as the stay at home dad in last year's ""Little Children"" plays Harris, the man torn between at least three different people. He is good as the son of a former housekeeper who now finds himself invited into this world, he seems to regard this environment with a healthy disdain. When Harris and Ann start to let their mutual attraction guide them, I became more involved in their characters.Hugh Dancy plays Buddy, the happy drunk who is trying to save his sister from a lifetime of misery. The role is very over the top and seems more than a little cartoony; sure, people act like this, but it is very difficult to make this type of character work. Unfortunately, because the character doesn't seem all that real when he becomes the lynchpin of the entire story, it falls a little flat.For a long time during the film, I appreciated the performances, but it wasn't until a scene between Wilson and Danes that I started to become emotionally affected by the characters. This scene happens quite late, so it takes a while to become fully involved in the story.""Evening"" is a beautiful film to watch and it is a very good film, but I think many people will expect the film to be great, based on the pedigree of the writer and the actresses involved.",4,"Stellar Cast Clouds Our Preconceptions of ""Evening""",1183593600,"07 5, 2007",2007,10050,"['Evening', 'chick',

There's two stories going on-one of a woman dying, another around a wedding years before. In order for  anyone to even begin to care about the dying woman and her memories, the wedding storyline needed to be setup correctly. IT""S NOT.

1099154,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000V6LSOA,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","The filmmakers of ""Evening"" obviously know great talents in film industry and they are quite lucky to put a great cast of stars together for making this film. The cast includes respected actresses including Aileen Atkins, Glenn Close, Meryl Streep and Vanessa Redgrave and all the actors and actresses show what they really can do here. Plus, Gyula Pados's cinematography is also strikingly beautiful. Hungarian-born director Lajos Koltai, himself gifted photographer and known for his collaboration with Istv&aacute;n Szab&oacute;, successfully creates a dreamy mood in this poignant romance of Ann Grant (Claire Danes). ""Evening"" has everything that would make a great film except one thing - a script.Despite the strong performances from the all-star cast and the several involving moments, ""Evening"" drags at times because of its overwrought script. The film uses flashbacks and flashforwards and it uses them too much. ""Evening"" starts with an old woman (Vanessa Redgrave) in her deathbed. Her daughters (Toni Collette and Natasha Richardson) hear some words, or names, spoken in delirium. Those words lead us back to one day 40 years ago.Then we meet young Ann who has just arrived at a New Port villa of her best friend Lila (Mamie Gummer). Lila is going to marry next day and guests are invited to celebrate the wedding, but her brother Buddy (Hugh Dancy) believes that she should reconsider her decision.The film is based on Susan Minot's novel which I haven't read. But I believe the story of Ann, Lila, Buddy and Lila's first love Harris (Patrick Wilson) could have been a much more dramatic romance with a straightforward approach, but script writers Susan Minot and Michael Cunningham (""The Hours"") seem to have thought differently. The rather simple narrative of their romantic story is frequently interrupted by flash-forwarding and we are not allowed to emotionally connect to any of the characters, whose traits tend to be represented by too familiar narrative devices such as a tormented young man walking with tipsy steps.As I said, the entire cast is brilliant, but the slow-moving film doesn't have the emotional impact that these talents can deliver. Actually, they manage to deliver sometimes - several scenes are really touching - but that is not surprising at all, looking at the names of the players.",3,Great Cast and Overwrought Script,1206489600,"03 26, 2008",2008,2326,"['filmmakers', 'Evening', 'obviously', 'know', 'great', 'talents', 'film', 'industry', 'are', 'quite', 'lucky', 'put', 'great', 'cast', 'stars', 'together', 'making', 'film', 'cast', 'respected', 'actresses', 'including', 'Aileen', 'Atkins', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'actors', 'show', 'what', 'really', 'can', 'do', 'here', 'Gyula', 'Pados', 'cinematography', 'also', 'strikingly', 'beautiful', 'Hungarian-born', 'director', 'Lajos', 'Koltai', 'gifted', 'photographer', 'known', 'collaboration', 'Istv', 'aacute', 'Szab', 'oacute', 'successfully', 'dreamy', 'mood', 'poignant', 'romance', 'Ann', 'Grant', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Evening', 'everything', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'script.Despite', 'strong', 'performances', 'all-star', 'cast', 'several', 'involving', 'moments', 'Evening', 'drags', 'times', 'overwrought', 'script', 'film', 'flashbacks', 'flashforwards', 'too', 'much', 'Evening', 'old', 'woman', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'deathbed', 'daughters', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Natasha', 'Richardson', 'hear', 'words', 'names', 'spoken', 'delirium', 'words', 'lead', 'back', 'one', 'day', '40', 'years', 'meet', 'young', 'Ann', 'who', 'just', 'arrived', 'New', 'Port', 'villa', 'best', 'friend', 'Lila', 'Mamie', 'Gummer', 'Lila', 'going', 'marry', 'next', 'day', 'guests', 'are', 'invited', 'celebrate', 'wedding', 'brother', 'Buddy', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'should', 'reconsider', 'decision.The', 'film', 'based', 'Susan', 'Minot', 'novel', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'believe', 'story', 'Ann', 'Lila', 'Buddy', 'Lila', 'first', 'love', 'Harris', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'dramatic', 'romance', 'straightforward', 'approach', 'script', 'writers', 'Susan', 'Minot', 'Michael', 'Cunningham', 'Hours', 'seem', 'have', 'thought', 'differently', 'rather', 'simple', 'narrative', 'romantic', 'story', 'frequently', 'interrupted', 'flash-forwarding', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'emotionally', 'connect', 'characters', 'traits', 'tend', 'be', 'represented', 'too', 'familiar', 'narrative', 'devices', 'such', 'tormented', 'young', 'man', 'walking', 'tipsy', 'steps.As', 'said', 'entire', 'cast', 'brilliant', 'slow-moving', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'emotional', 'impact', 'talents', 'can', 'deliver', 'Actually', 'manage', 'deliver', 'sometimes', 'several', 'scenes', 'are', 'really', 'touching', 'not', 'surprising', 'looking', 'names', 'players']",N/A

But from the get-go there was no chemistry,  with anybody - especially between the central character, Ann and supposedly love of her life, Harris. Patrick Wilson as Harris was just painful to watch - he showed as much passion as a flounder. And Hugh Dancy just was not believable to me as a lost soul drunk. And I usually love Claire Danes - but she was just ok in this film. I think the best were Natasha Richardson, Toni Collette and Mamie Gummer.
