1508616,AAZRWLML88IZK,B0062P332Y,A kids review,"[5, 15]","Jason Statham quickly went from witty Guy Ritchie discovery to fully fledged action star, so much so that he even earned a spot in the distinguished, testosterone-fueled lineup of Sylvester Stallone's Expendables franchise. Unfortunately, I have only liked a few of Statham's starring vehicles. Enter Killer Elite, which teamed Statham with the legendary Robert De Niro and ""why isn't he a bigger star"" Clive Owen. That should help, right? Apparently, no, not really. I found Killer Elite, which had a De Niro-mentored Statham, a special ops vet, squaring off against Owen's militant crime leader, to be utterly by-the-books and disposable. Expendable, even. While tI admit that I had a reasonably good time, I mostly felt the proceedings were all too familiar.

But with other connected parties all throwing their own agendas into the mix, Danny has more than three tough-as-nails SAS soldiers to worry about.`Killer Elite' is a great, edgy, action-thriller to sit through and delivers a pretty good story with it. Granted, sometimes it relies on coincidences to get characters into a fight and people just `discover' things for our characters to get the plot moving, not to mention, people keep carrying out their plans despite knowing they're being watched, but there's really a lot going on here with the different groups, and characters, all having their own motives for helping or hindering the mission, and so it adds a lot of unexpected twists and tension into the story.The action is largely enjoyable and it's great to see that they tried to keep it all as grounded as they could, this being based on a supposedly true story, there was nothing really over-the-top; just simple, straight-forward, smack-bang action that kept with the realistic, gritty tone of the film.The performances were really good and believable, all the characters felt like they belonged in this dark world; Jason Statham channels...well...Jason Statham into Danny. Clive Owen is appropriately menacing and scary as Spike, Danny's counterpart and Robert De Niro pulls off a role that he can probably do sleeping. Dominic Purcell, Aden Young, Ben Mendelsohn and the beautiful Yvonne Strahovski all capably support the main cast.I only saw the deleted scenes, most I can understand why director Gary McKendry left out, but there were others that, if they had been kept in, would've really helped to explain a few things and fleshed out some of the characters a bit more.

Let's dismiss the film's claim to being based on fact and see whether it is entertaining.  First, who are the killer elite of the title?  It should be Britain's famed SAS, some members of which are to be targeted by a small group of mercenaries hired by an Omani sheikh to get revenge for the deaths of his sons.  It may however be the mercenaries, who are to be seen as among the best in their particular line of work.  They include Jason Statham and, tangentially, Robert DeNiro.  But it may be a small ""committee"" of ex-SAS who include Clive Owen, who collectively are known as the ""Feather Men"".  The violent interplay between the latter two groups and especially between Statham and Owen is the heart of the movie.There are some outstanding fight scenes, some interesting developments in the plot, and excellent acting.  Here it should be mentioned that there is a love interest between Statham and Yvonne Strahovski (yes, the model and voice of Miranda in Mass Effect 2 and 3!) that works better than such things usually do in movies of this sort.  There is also a buddy thing going on between Statham and DeNiro, despite being of different generations, leading one to ask why DeNiro was picked for the part and why he chose to accept?

1508652,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0062P332Y,Grady Harp,"[19, 21]","KILLER ELITE is a true story taken from the book 'The Feather Men' by Sir Ranulph Fiennes, adapted for the screen by Matt Sherring, and directed with an eye toward speed by Gary McKendry. The bit of history that the film addresses is the aftermath of the Dhofar Rebellion launched in the province of Dhofar against the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, which had British support, from 1962 to 1976. It ended with the defeat of the rebels, but the state of Oman had to be radically reformed and modernized to cope with the campaign. The fact that three sons of the Sheik of Oman were killed by the British leaving the Sheik with a strong need for revenge so that he can regain his kingdom by sending his remaining son to a safe land is the springboard for the film's plot.Before the film's action begins, the Sheik has taken hired assassin Hunter (Robert De Niro) captive because he failed to kill the murderers of his three sons. The film opens in 1980 the exiled Sheik (with his remaining son Bakhait - Firass Dirani) hires Hunter's pupil Danny (Jason Statham), a retired member of Britain's Elite Special Air Service, to kill the three assassins of his sons. A private organization of ex SAS tasks men headed by Spike (Clive Owen) is assigned to protect the British assassins. Covering the globe from Australia to Paris, London and the Middle East, Danny and Hunter, two of the worlds' most elite operatives, are plunged into a highly dangerous game of cat and mouse - where the predators become the prey.There is plenty of incredible action in the form of one-on-one fights between Statham and Owen, car chases, and other acts of derring-do to keep the film rolling. At times the plot gets muddy and some of the characters are not well defined - those played by Domenic Purcell, Aden Young, Ben Mendelsohn and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje in particular. And of course there is the requisite romance between Statham and Yvonne Strahovski, which helps soften the film periodically. But basically this is an action film; the main reason it is of such interest is the fact that it is based on a true story - a story whose history is shared in the closing credits. Definitely a film for Statham/De Niro/Owen fans!

Make no mistake about it, though, the action in this film is non-stop and, best of all, it's old-school. By that I mean, you can see the hits landing in the hand-to-hand fight scenes and when there's a car-chase, you can follow the action with some sense of direction. The acting in the Killer Elite is also praise worthy. Statham plays just about the same role he always plays, but, you probably alreay knew that. However, Statham plays that role better than just about anyone else currently. His acting, in that role, has always been solid for an action star, but in this film he seems to have improved. Deniro adds a touch of class in the mentor role. Deniro's as charismatic as ever, no complaints. Owen's very-good as well, but there are many excellent performances from actors whose names didn't make it onto the front-cover, among them are Aden Young and Dominic Purcell as members of Statham's team. In conclusion, I'd like to add that Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper were two of the very few mainstream film critics that gave a positive reveiw to Killer Elite during its theatrical release.

1508664,A2COCRWXXUQI8G,B0062P332Y,J. Bradley,"[26, 37]","Within two weeks of September 2011 we had as many remakes of Peckinpah's weakest era of movies - ""Straw Dogs"" and then ""Killer Elite"". At least this pretty much just takes the title and runs with it. It mixes in a bit of history from the late 70's and early 80's  (this movie takes place in 1980)  involving ""The Feather Men"" an organization within the British government that, using their ""light touch"" on geopolitics, were involved in the killing of a shiek's sons in Oman. In this version Jason Statham is a mercenary hired by a dying shiek to kill the British SAS guys who killed his sons. This way the family honor will be returned and his one living son can take his place in the hierarchy and the British government will ultimately reap the political and economic rewards for helping to bring all this about. He accomplishes these tasks but now, Clive Owen, playing the SAS guy employed by ""Feather Men"", wants to get back at Statham's character for killing three of his SAS guys. The movie's a pretty good mix of more believable ""spy stuff"" and action that's still pretty hyper-stylized. I kept thinking about movies like ""The Wild Geese"" and ""Dogs of War"" which came out about the same time this movie takes place and it struck me how this IS kind of like those movies but with the hand-held camera ""this is happening right now"" Jason Bourne type action, from this current era. All in all I don't come away with an overall strong impression of what makes this movie stand out from the other action movies this year. ""Hanna"" was sort of an ""art action movie"" and ""Colombiana"" was a slicked-up, modern grindhouse movie. This has some great sequences like Statham fighting off two guys while cuffed to a chair, but this mix of Bourne era movie action and post-Watergate/pre Iran Contra conspiracy stuff ultimately just all blurs together. The parts are greater than the whole.

1508673,A13TLQ1EQBWJ7U,B0062P332Y,Johnny Na,"[1, 1]","I checked this movie out for the cast and thought I could do no wrong cause I'm a big fan of De Niro, Statham and Owen.  My first impression that something was amiss was when the main ""elite killer"" (Statham) turns his back on a wounded armed baddie and decides to look out the window during a stealthy escape.  There are a number of WTF moments like that, and it's sad because I think the movie has some good stuff to show.  It's not a horrible movie but it isn't a great one either.I mostly enjoyed plot aspects like Statham's group being hired to kill 3 guys while yet another group (Owen's group) notices this and starts to observe Statham's group.  So there are some inter-group dynamics that get pretty interesting by the time the guy in the black helicopter shows up (MFWIC).  Then there is the committee that sort of controls Owen's group except when it doesn't.My point is there are some complex group dynamics at play.  It takes some effort to keep track of it all, but it is interesting even when it's hard to understand everyone's motive right away.  I also enjoyed the aspect of Statham's work that involved making all his hits look like accidents.  It reminded me of Mission Impossible a bit and I think that could have been expanded on more.  And some of the action was well done with a few original embellishments.But how can you believe a group like Statham's are elite killers when one of the recruits does some unbelievably dumb stuff?  Or is the title half satire?  Apparently professional killers don't look for qualifications in their hiring.  Unless of course ""I'm schtupping his Mother"" is a reference.The movie seems fast paced to me not just because of the action but the frequent cuts between different scenes.  So I don't think everyone will have time to dwell on the gaping logical holes in the script.  Some bad dialog however is right in our face and the cliches are plain and painful.  I also wish the film had done more on scene work.

1508674,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B0062P332Y,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.I'm having a hard time figuring out a way to start this. As the title suggests I was expecting something totally different when I watched Killer Elite the other day. It's not that it was bad, I just think I might have gotten this confused with another movie when I picked it up at the video store.The film wastes no time in throwing you into the action when about five minutes in we reach our first firefight. This segment manages to set up the back story of the film. We have Danny Bryce (Jason Statham) that wishes to get out of the hitman business. Unfortunately that doesn't last long when he finds out that his partner Hunter (Robert De Niro) is being held captive. In order to free his former partner Danny must complete the job that Hunter failed to accomplish. It might have been a good story if it had been a little more coherent, but sadly it felt like it went all over the place.For me it felt like the director put more focus on the action than he did on constructing a proper plot. So in that regard I guess you can say he accomplished his goal. There's a lot of action sequences in here and almost all of them are pretty intense. However they do start to lose some of their flare once you reach the halfway mark. Plus the camera work on this film is pretty awful at times. You'll occasionally reach a few segments that look more like a blur than an actual scene.The best thing about this film is its cast, or I should say it's main cast. On the forefront you have Jason Statham, Robert De Niro, and Clive Owen. While Statham is the one who appears most in the film, Clive Owen has some pretty frequent scenes and he makes his presence notable. Overall the acting was well done, I just feel like it would have been more enjoyable to watch had they gotten a better script.Finally, the sound on this is extremely irritating. All the dialogue sequences sound like a whisper and they almost always cut into a very loud action sequence right after. I was constantly turning the volume up and then lowering it down a few minutes later. I don't know about you, but when I have to do that while watching the film it bugs the living hell out of me. I just want to watch it, I shouldn't have to be fiddling with the remote every five minutes.Overall Score: 6/10 - I really wanted to enjoy this film, but in the end it was kind of lackluster. Whether it's because I picked up the wrong film I don't know, but even if I picked up the right movie I still think I wouldn't have been too satisfied with what I watched. The only really interesting thing about this movie is that it's supposedly based on a true story. Other than that it's just another action flick that relies too heavily on violence without using it to form some kind of proper story.

One thing saving this from being a 4 star to 5 star movie for me are some inconsistancies with some of the clothing and props and the story started in 1980 then jumped one year later then there was another mention of date being 1980.  You could take the action out of this movie and you have a great story.  The action was incredible as Statham usually is and it was interesting how Deniro's character fleshed out in the end of the movie.  There is a lot of story and action crammed into a 2 hour movie with it feeling rushed at all, it felt like a much longer movie.

The original had James Caan & Robert Duvall; this remake has Jason Statham & Robert De Niro sounds like it couldn't miss right? Wrong. It's all action and complicated plot points and no soul. All explosions, gunfire, and fights and none of it matters. The original had the assassins/friends turning on each other with Duvall putting Caan out of the business by wounding him severely, but not killing him. The rehab & revenge angle of that film made it worth seeing. Here we have a genuine 'buddy' film but the 2 buddies kill people for money. De Niro is also a 'family man' with a Wife & kids we never see, while Statham has a beautiful girlfriend waiting for him back home who just wants to reform her man from his wicked past thru her undying love. Dumb. Jason Statham is a genuine action star and has made some good movies (The Transporter is one), and De Niro made a similar(but MUCH better) film, ""Ronan"" but both tough guys 'flop' here.

Oleson,"[5, 6]","This perfunctory action film opens in Mexico with a hit squad comprised of Jason Statham, Robert De Niro and Dominic Purcell taking out some high ranking guy in a limo.  We don't know who he is (politician?, drug lord?) but the scene closes when Danny (Statham) comes face to face with the young son of the guy he just killed.  I guess this is the critical point when Danny decides to retire.A year later in 1981, Danny has moved to Australia and taken up housekeeping with Anne (Yvonne Strahovski, TV's ""Chuck"").  She's gorgeous of course, but you wouldn't know it here.  She is pretty much wallpaper in a roomy cotton dress most of the time.  Danny must travel to Oman to rescue his friend Hunter (De Niro) who is being held by a sheik.  So here's the deal.  The sheik will release Hunter if Danny will fulfill Hunter's original job.  That is to kill 3 British SAS (Special Forces) officers that were responsible for killing the sheik's 3 sons during the conflicts in the late 1970's.  This is never clear when or why.  Just that they are dead and the Brits did it.But, these guys can't just be killed.  They must confess first and Danny must provide proof.  Danny gets his old buddy Davies (Purcell, the best thing in this movie) and another guy (Aden Young) to help out.  There's a $6 million reward if they pull it off plus the release of Hunter.  My head starts to hurt trying to figure out who is on which side.  Something about a double top secret SAS squad controlled by some old farts in suits.Somehow Clive Owen is involved as the main foe of Danny.  But then Spike (yes, that's Owen's character) is all for Queen and country.  Spike is also the only one who has a chance of beating Danny in hand to hand combat.  This movie is a convoluted mess.  Even with a stellar cast this film is just  a time waster.  Statham is as good as it gets in action adventure and Owen is always good.  But De Niro is miscast and is obviously here for a paycheck.  They are not the problem.  Based on true events, the entire concept is just an incoherent bore the way it is written.The Blu ray disc is sharp and clear.

Statham plays Danny, a retired contract killer in the early 80s that gets drawn back into the game when his mentor and friend (De Niro) gets kidnapped and soon enough Danny finds himself on a reluctant mission, and eventually on the run from another pro (Owen) that's just as driven as he is.  While Killer Elite manages to pack enough nicely orchestrated action set pieces, there isn't anything here you haven't seen before.

It is a good film, filled with action.This film is said to be based on fact and not fiction. It is far fetched in some ways, but with the recent assassination of a scientist in Iran, presumably by the Israelis or the CIA, I find it more believable. Two teams of ex-SAS men are trying to kill each other. Or, at least, Jason Statham, has been asked to kill four ex-SAS men, and to make it look like an accident. He agrees to this mission to save the life of his mentor, played by Robert De Niro. Clive Owen, is from a group of men called the 'Feather Men' who are hired to protect ex-SAS men from retribution. A little convoluted, but all in all simple to follow. Each team has become hired killers after their stints in the SAS, and this is not a game for amateurs. De Niro is being held hostage by a sheik in Oman. Statham travels all over th eworld to hunt for his prey. He has a team that is first rate, and some of the action is complicated and breath taking. What holds this film together are the characters and the plot. We can see the action in many films, but the plot and the acting here are superb.  All of the killers realize it is their professionalism that keeps them going. Face to face combat and high technology are all a part of this play.I liked this film, and as a spy novel/film afficianado, much of it seemed realistic. Of course, the director/writer took liberites, but that is necessary in this type of film. There is a little bit of love interest, and that creates a huge problem for one of the men,. The rest of the teams do not mention family, and it would seem in this kind of world, loners would be the best killers. I would have expected this film to do much better at the box office.

As I said there is a LOT of plot,and so many twists and turns and intrigues,that one could really never do justice to it all.Just trust me,that if you just hang in there,you will be rewarded.The film does have a tendency to drift a little,such as their traveling back and forth between desert and civilization constantly,and who is on the hit list next,can get a little overwhelming.But the makers somehow manage to keep a straight heading throughout.Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its 2:40:1 original a/r.There are cast interviews and 13 deleted scenes.All in all a whopper of a story to tell,but based on true incidents.Statham is on game and as intense as always.DeNiro,while not having a significant role to play is also on target as is other star Clive

Since it's domination of the late 80s, Action movies have really suffered due to a lack of decent story lines and an infestation of stars, who landed these roles, simply due to their size, but Statham is changing all that, as evident by his latest film, Killer Elite. Based on the novel, The Feather Men by Ranulph Fiennes, Killer Elite covers the events, following a British covert op in the early 80s. The British Navy Seals (The S.A.S.) secretly forced out oil rich land owners in the Middle East, by whatever means necessary, in order to steal their land. Five years later, on his death bed, one sheik is seeking revenge for the death of 3 of his sons. To do this, the sheik has hired an elite team of underground hit men to take out the men suspected of killing his children, not an easy task when you consider that all the targets are highly trained former military operatives. Jason Statham stars as Danny Bryce, the team leader who is forced out of retirement, to take on the hardest job of his career. As has become common place, Statham is terrific and really carries the story on his back. Killer Elite is a someone complicated plot, with a first time director, but thanks to Statham's experience, you'll think these guys have been working together for year. As his reputation has continued to grow, bigger and bigger stars want to work with Statham, and any time you can add names like Robert De Niro and Clive Owen to a film, it only enhances it and boosts it's potential audience. Aside from just the amazing action sequences and covert maneuvers, the story adds real life drama to the film, by including shady government cover ups, double agents, and even police involvement in the events, making for the rarest of rare in the Action genre, a film with a deep and compelling plot. That's what really makes this film so good, it's not just about the chases, explosions, and killing, there is a real story here, that is unpredictable and very well written. Killer Elite may not top Parker as Statham's best movie, but it's pretty close. If you enjoy a fast-paced, edge of your seat movie, with a lot of interesting characters and a deep plot, than you won't want to miss this film.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1398556800,"04 27, 2014",2014,2322,"['Jason', 'Statham', 'movie', 'better', 'last', 'cement', 'reputation', 'action', 'star', 'Generation', 'X', 'domination', 'late', '80s', 'Action', 'movies', 'have', 'really', 'suffered', 'due', 'lack', 'decent', 'story', 'lines', 'infestation', 'stars', 'who', 'landed', 'roles', 'simply', 'due', 'size', 'Statham', 'changing', 'that', 'evident', 'latest', 'film', 'Killer', 'Elite', 'Based', 'novel', 'Feather', 'Men', 'Ranulph', 'Fiennes', 'Killer', 'Elite', 'events', 'following', 'British', 'covert', 'op', 'early', '80s', 'British', 'Navy', 'Seals', 'S.A.S', 'secretly', 'forced', 'out', 'oil', 'rich', 'land', 'owners', 'Middle', 'East', 'means', 'necessary', 'order', 'steal', 'land', 'Five', 'years', 'later', 'death', 'bed', 'one', 'sheik', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'death', '3', 'sons', 'do', 'sheik', 'hired', 'elite', 'team', 'underground', 'hit', 'men', 'take', 'out', 'men', 'suspected', 'killing', 'children', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'when', 'consider', 'targets', 'are', 'highly', 'trained', 'former', 'military', 'operatives', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'Danny', 'Bryce', 'team', 'leader', 'who', 'forced', 'retirement', 'take', 'hardest', 'job', 'career', 'become', 'common', 'place', 'Statham', 'terrific', 'really', 'story', 'back', 'Killer', 'Elite', 'someone', 'complicated', 'plot', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'thanks', 'Statham', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'think', 'guys', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'together', 'year', 'reputation', 'continued', 'grow', 'bigger', 'bigger', 'stars', 'want', 'work', 'Statham', 'time', 'can', 'add', 'names', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'film', 'only', 'potential', 'audience', 'Aside', 'just', 'amazing', 'action', 'sequences', 'covert', 'maneuvers', 'story', 'real', 'life', 'drama', 'film', 'including', 'shady', 'government', 'cover', 'ups', 'double', 'agents', 'even', 'police', 'involvement', 'events', 'making', 'rarest', 'rare', 'Action', 'genre', 'film', 'deep', 'compelling', 'plot', 'what', 'really', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'not', 'just', 'chases', 'explosions', 'killing', 'real', 'story', 'here', 'unpredictable', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'Killer', 'Elite', 'may', 'not', 'top', 'Parker', 'Statham', 'best', 'movie', 'pretty', 'close', 'enjoy', 'fast-paced', 'edge', 'seat', 'movie', 'lot', 'interesting', 'characters', 'deep', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'film']",Killer Elite

This movie is based on a true story (if it comes out as 100% true someone is in trouble) of a British SAS mission. Going in I have to admit one of the reasons I watched it was because of Statham. I know what you are thinking, ""but all his movies are the same"". I agree with you but I still watch everything he is in. This one is really no different, but it does have better actors with him. This is a movie with so much potential but ultimately was very up and down. Some scenes were very exciting and fun to watch, while others were flat and boring. Not a lot of consistency made the movie a little disappointing, but the ending was great and made up for the down times. I did enjoy this but glad I didn't pay full price in a theater.

The story (adapted from the book by ""The Feather Men"" by Sir Ranulph Fiennes, which he claims is based on truths) is about a group of mercenaries hunting down the targets, while being chased by a former SAS officer leading a secret society ""The Feathermen."" Largely set in 1980, ""Killer Elite"" looks like a throwback to the 80's style action movies with tough guys with a good heart fighting for what they believe. No high-tech gadgets. No shaky camerawork. Just hardheaded heroes with guns and muscles.Jason Statham is Danny, a former member of a mercenary team: Danny, Hunter (Robert De Niro), Davies (Dominic Purcell) and Meier (Aden Young). Severely wounded in Mexico and fed up with the life as a mercenary, Danny retires and goes back to Australia. One year later, however, he is called back into action when his mentor Hunter is held captive by a sheik of Oman.What the sheik wants is revenge for the deaths of his sons, and forces Danny to kill three former SAS agents. With Davies and Meier, Danny sets out for one last mission, but the ""Feathermen"" enforcer Spike (Clive Owen) is quick to respond, trying to protect the targeted SAS members while tracking down Danny.Yvonne Strahovski appears as Anne, Danny's girlfriend, but ""Killer Elite"" is mostly about these tough guys and their missions. Acting is solid, location is interesting, and action set-pieces (shoot-outs and chases) are very good, though the cat-and mouse story itself is not compelling as it should be.",4,(3.5 STARS) Solid 80s-ish Old School Action,1337299200,"05 18, 2012",2012,1647,"['Director', 'Gary', 'McKendry', 'first', 'deature', 'film', 'Killer', 'Elite', 'old', 'school', 'action', 'flick', 'starring', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'action', 'stars', 'generation', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'story', 'adapted', 'book', 'Feather', 'Men', 'Sir', 'Ranulph', 'Fiennes', 'based', 'truths', 'group', 'mercenaries', 'hunting', 'down', 'targets', 'being', 'chased', 'former', 'SAS', 'officer', 'leading', 'secret', 'society', 'Feathermen', 'Largely', 'set', '1980', 'Killer', 'Elite', 'throwback', '80', 'style', 'action', 'movies', 'tough', 'guys', 'good', 'heart', 'fighting', 'what', 'believe', 'high-tech', 'gadgets', 'shaky', 'camerawork', 'Just', 'hardheaded', 'heroes', 'guns', 'muscles.Jason', 'Statham', 'Danny', 'former', 'member', 'mercenary', 'team', 'Danny', 'Hunter', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Davies', 'Dominic', 'Purcell', 'Meier', 'Aden', 'Young', 'Severely', 'wounded', 'Mexico', 'fed', 'up', 'life', 'mercenary', 'Danny', 'back', 'Australia', 'One', 'year', 'later', 'however', 'called', 'back', 'action', 'when', 'mentor', 'Hunter', 'held', 'captive', 'sheik', 'Oman.What', 'sheik', 'revenge', 'deaths', 'sons', 'forces', 'Danny', 'kill', 'three', 'former', 'SAS', 'agents', 'Davies', 'Meier', 'Danny', 'out', 'one', 'last', 'mission', 'Feathermen', 'enforcer', 'Spike', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'quick', 'respond', 'trying', 'protect', 'targeted', 'SAS', 'members', 'tracking', 'down', 'Danny.Yvonne', 'Strahovski', 'Anne', 'Danny', 'girlfriend', 'Killer', 'Elite', 'mostly', 'tough', 'guys', 'missions', 'Acting', 'solid', 'location', 'interesting', 'action', 'set-pieces', 'shoot-outs', 'chases', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'cat-and', 'mouse', 'story', 'not', 'compelling', 'should', 'be']",Killer Elite

""The Killer Elite"" (Peckinpah's film) is based on the novel ""Monkey in The Middle"" by Robert Rostand while THIS film is based on a ""nonfiction"" book by Sir Ranulph Fiennes called ""The Feather Men"".Mercenary assassins Danny Bryce (Jason Statham), Davies (Dominic Purcell), and Meier (Aden Young)must save their colleague Hunter (Robert DeNiro)who is taken prisoner for a failed assassination. If Bryce, Davies and Meier don't complete Hunter's mission (for which he was promised $6 million) to assassinate the killers of the Sheikh Amr's sons, they'll kill him. Complicating Bryce's mission are ""the Feather Men"" a group of former SAS members who protect their own. Their enforcer Spike Logan (Clive Owen) is sent to investigate and prevent the killing of its members.A well made thriller from first time feature director Gary McKendry, ""Killer Elit"" positively bristles with energy and features something a bit unusual for a thriller of this type--actual character development. It's not enough that the action sequences are well designed, many unique and well shot the fact that McKendry and screenwriter Matt Sherring create a compelling thriller with a solid story and solid performances. There have been some compliants about the various subplots in the film slowing down the action with exposition and I'd disagree. I found it to be a nice combination of the parranoid thrillers from the 1970's and early 80's combined with the more recent action driven ones. I suspect that those complaining about the exposition don't care for those more paranoid spy thrillers from another era.The one flaw with the film is that it could have been trimmed a bit but that's a minor complaint at best. The characters, acting and action sequences more than make up for a slightly bloated running time. At it's best ""Killer Elite"" reminds me of some of John Frankenheimer's strong later thrillers.The DVD looks quite nice with a solid presentation. Colors are on the cool side (and reflects the original theatrical presentation of the movie). Audio is extremely active with a nice, immersive 5.1 mix.It would have been nice to have a more special features such as a commentary track unfortunately all we get are 13 deleted scenes.",4,"Entertaining thriller with a top notch cast--this is NOT a remake of ""The Killer Elite""",1329523200,"02 18, 2012",2012,2395,"['shares', 'nearly', 'same', 'title', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'film', 'Killer', 'Elite', 'fact', 'government', 'affiliated', 'assassins', 'nothing', 'do', 'film', 'Killer', 'Elite', 'Peckinpah', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'Monkey', 'Middle', 'Robert', 'Rostand', 'THIS', 'film', 'based', 'nonfiction', 'book', 'Sir', 'Ranulph', 'Fiennes', 'called', 'Feather', 'Men', '.Mercenary', 'assassins', 'Danny', 'Bryce', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'Davies', 'Dominic', 'Purcell', 'Meier', 'Aden', 'Young', 'must', 'save', 'colleague', 'Hunter', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'who', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'failed', 'assassination', 'Bryce', 'Davies', 'Meier', 'do', ""n't"", 'complete', 'Hunter', 'mission', 'was', 'promised', '6', 'million', 'assassinate', 'killers', 'Sheikh', 'Amr', 'sons', ""'ll"", 'kill', 'Complicating', 'Bryce', 'mission', 'are', 'Feather', 'Men', 'group', 'former', 'SAS', 'members', 'who', 'protect', 'own', 'enforcer', 'Spike', 'Logan', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'sent', 'investigate', 'prevent', 'killing', 'members.A', 'well', 'made', 'thriller', 'first', 'time', 'feature', 'director', 'Gary', 'McKendry', 'Killer', 'Elit', 'positively', 'energy', 'features', 'something', 'bit', 'unusual', 'thriller', 'type', 'actual', 'character', 'development', 'not', 'enough', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'well', 'designed', 'many', 'unique', 'well', 'shot', 'fact', 'McKendry', 'screenwriter', 'Matt', 'Sherring', 'create', 'compelling', 'thriller', 'solid', 'story', 'solid', 'performances', 'have', 'been', 'compliants', 'various', 'subplots', 'film', 'slowing', 'down', 'action', 'exposition', ""'d"", 'disagree', 'found', 'be', 'nice', 'combination', 'parranoid', 'thrillers', '1970', 'early', '80', 'combined', 'more', 'recent', 'action', 'driven', 'ones', 'suspect', 'complaining', 'exposition', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'more', 'paranoid', 'spy', 'thrillers', 'era.The', 'one', 'flaw', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'trimmed', 'bit', 'minor', 'complaint', 'best', 'characters', 'acting', 'action', 'sequences', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'slightly', 'bloated', 'running', 'time', 'best', 'Killer', 'Elite', 'John', 'Frankenheimer', 'strong', 'later', 'thrillers.The', 'DVD', 'quite', 'nice', 'solid', 'presentation', 'Colors', 'are', 'cool', 'side', 'original', 'theatrical', 'presentation', 'movie', 'Audio', 'extremely', 'active', 'nice', 'immersive', '5.1', 'mix.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'more', 'special', 'features', 'such', 'commentary', 'track', 'unfortunately', 'get', 'are', '13', 'deleted', 'scenes']",Killer Elite
