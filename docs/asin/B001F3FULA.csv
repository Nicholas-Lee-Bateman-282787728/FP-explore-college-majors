1187955,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,B001F3FULA,Israel Drazin,"[3, 3]","Benjamin Franklin wrote that to be overzealous in religion is to be non-religious. The rabbi in this film should have listened to Franklin. This is an award-wining Israeli film containing a pitiful and tragic portrayal of an overly religious Israeli Jew. It depicts the life of two loving parents and their adorable male child. The father is an inflexible pious rabbi who is convinced, and so teaches his congregation and family, that Jews must do everything that is stated in the Torah without asking why. But, unfortunately, like many pious people, he misunderstands the words and spirit of the Torah.His world view can be seen in two of many well acted episodes. The Bible states that when a person comes across a mother bird sitting on eggs or chicks and the person wants to take the eggs or chicks, the person must first chase away the mother bird. The Bible commentators explain that this is done either to avoid hurting the feelings of the mother bird or to teach humans to be kind to one another. This rabbi misunderstands. He is convinced that the Torah obligates Jews to chase away a mother bird whenever they see her sitting by chicks, whether they want to take the chicks or not. He does this and causes unnecessary pain to the mother bird.Another example is his sermon to his congregation where he chauvinistically and improperly teaches that God only watches and aids pious Jews, no one else. All other people, he teaches, were created to make life easy for pious Jews.The film maker shows how his misguided understanding results in a terrible tragedy.",5,A profoundly dramatic tale,1315094400,"09 4, 2011",2011,1566,"['Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'wrote', 'be', 'overzealous', 'religion', 'be', 'non-religious', 'rabbi', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'listened', 'Franklin', 'award-wining', 'Israeli', 'film', 'containing', 'pitiful', 'tragic', 'portrayal', 'overly', 'religious', 'Israeli', 'Jew', 'life', 'two', 'loving', 'parents', 'adorable', 'male', 'child', 'father', 'inflexible', 'pious', 'rabbi', 'who', 'convinced', 'so', 'teaches', 'congregation', 'family', 'Jews', 'must', 'do', 'everything', 'stated', 'Torah', 'asking', 'why', 'unfortunately', 'many', 'pious', 'people', 'words', 'spirit', 'Torah.His', 'world', 'view', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'two', 'many', 'well', 'acted', 'episodes', 'Bible', 'states', 'when', 'person', 'mother', 'bird', 'sitting', 'eggs', 'chicks', 'person', 'take', 'eggs', 'chicks', 'person', 'must', 'first', 'chase', 'away', 'mother', 'bird', 'Bible', 'commentators', 'explain', 'done', 'avoid', 'hurting', 'feelings', 'mother', 'bird', 'teach', 'humans', 'be', 'kind', 'one', 'rabbi', 'misunderstands', 'convinced', 'Torah', 'Jews', 'chase', 'away', 'mother', 'bird', 'whenever', 'see', 'sitting', 'chicks', 'want', 'take', 'chicks', 'not', 'unnecessary', 'pain', 'mother', 'bird.Another', 'example', 'sermon', 'congregation', 'where', 'chauvinistically', 'improperly', 'teaches', 'God', 'only', 'aids', 'pious', 'Jews', 'one', 'else', 'other', 'people', 'were', 'created', 'make', 'life', 'easy', 'pious', 'Jews.The', 'film', 'maker', 'how', 'misguided', 'understanding', 'results', 'terrible', 'tragedy']",My Father My Lord

The acting in this heartbreaking drama was absolutely impeccable as we meet an Orthodox rabbi, his wife and their young son of about eight.  There is love in this small family and they do not question their religious practices or beliefs.  And then a tragedy occurs, and their lives are turned upside down.  There were tears in my eyes as I watched this film.  It felt absolutely real with the story moving quickly and the proper amount of time spent to establish their characters and their motives.  I was captured from the very beginning and consider this film  a small work of art.I saw this film at the Tribecca Film festival and had the privilege of hearing the director talk about his work.  All the people involved in the production were Israeli, of course, but they were not necessarily Orthodox.  All the details included in the film made the story very  real.  And the ending raised the kind of open-ended moral question that resonated with me  long after I left the theater.I am glad the this film is finally getting wide distribution.  But even if it hadn't made it, this filmmaker clearly has a gift for making films and his future looks bright. Because the film is so sad, I cannot recommend it for everyone.  But I sure am glad it is now being sold on Amazon.Highly recommended.",5,A small work of art that will resonate long after the end of the film,1227312000,"11 22, 2008",2008,1393,"['Israeli', 'import', 'big', 'theme', 'price', 'paid', 'following', 'rigid', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'acting', 'heartbreaking', 'drama', 'was', 'absolutely', 'impeccable', 'meet', 'Orthodox', 'rabbi', 'wife', 'young', 'son', 'about', 'eight', 'love', 'small', 'family', 'do', 'not', 'question', 'religious', 'practices', 'beliefs', 'then', 'tragedy', 'occurs', 'lives', 'are', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'were', 'tears', 'eyes', 'watched', 'film', 'felt', 'absolutely', 'real', 'story', 'moving', 'quickly', 'proper', 'amount', 'time', 'spent', 'establish', 'characters', 'motives', 'was', 'captured', 'very', 'beginning', 'consider', 'film', 'small', 'work', 'art.I', 'saw', 'film', 'Tribecca', 'Film', 'festival', 'had', 'privilege', 'hearing', 'director', 'talk', 'work', 'people', 'involved', 'production', 'were', 'Israeli', 'course', 'were', 'not', 'necessarily', 'Orthodox', 'details', 'included', 'film', 'made', 'story', 'very', 'real', 'ending', 'raised', 'kind', 'open-ended', 'moral', 'question', 'resonated', 'long', 'left', 'theater.I', 'am', 'film', 'finally', 'getting', 'wide', 'distribution', 'even', 'had', ""n't"", 'made', 'filmmaker', 'clearly', 'gift', 'making', 'films', 'future', 'bright', 'film', 'so', 'sad', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'sure', 'am', 'glad', 'now', 'being', 'sold', 'Amazon.Highly', 'recommended']",My Father My Lord

1187958,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B001F3FULA,Paul Allaer,"[4, 4]","I have been on a roll of great and/or interesting Israeli movies (more on that later), and I picked this up, really not knowing much about the movie, other that it came highly recommended.""My Father, My Lord"" (75 min, originally released in 2007) is a slow-moving movie that portrays an ultra-Orthodox family in their daily doings. The dad is a highly-respected rabbi, the mom a complying wife. They have a young son (I'm guessing 8 yrs old or so), and much of the movie centers around how the young son experiences life growing up in an ultra-Orthodox setting. The movie builds up to a long-anticipated (by the young son) trip to the beach at the Dead Sea. And then the unthinkable happens. I wish the movie would've explored more of the aftermath, as the movie concludes too quickly for my liking.I visited Israel this past November on a business trip, so my exposure to the Orthodox community was/has been minimal. This movie provides a great glampse into that community. I have to say that I wondered at times if the lead characters were actually actors, or real-life Orthodox persons, that's how real it felt. Despite its shortcomings (included the too-short running time), I'd recommend this movie in a heartbeat.

1187960,A3KKOJ6T4DCBDT,B001F3FULA,"technoguy ""jack""","[1, 1]","A film made with great simplicity and coherence.The orthodox rabbi who leads his Haredi Hassidic community,giving sermons of God's absolute love for humans,who are Jewish and follow the Torah.He is deeply loved by his wife and his pre-Mitzvah son,Menahem(Ilan Griff).The young boy is respectful of his father and has a place in the synagogue,where he peeps at his father's all-knowing eloquence or falls asleep.His wife,Esther(Bar) loves Menahem dearly and wants him to love his father reverently.She intervenes when Abraham(Dayan),reprimands Menahem for keeping a picture of idol worship amongst primitive people,telling him to rip up the picture.The rabbi also is irritated that Menahem thinks animals have souls,after seeing a dog's slavish loyalty to its owner taken away in an ambulance.This film is made with hand held digital cameras and music of great tenderness and empathy.Menahem is curious about the natural world,studying a dove's nest with its chicks.His father makes the mother dove depart(a commandment in the Torah)leaving the chicks to fend for themselves.Menahem wonders what will become of the chicks,what will happen to the mother.The rabbi thinks that God is all merciful.However on a trip to the Dead Sea, Menahem's mother is separated according to the rules from the men,she goes to a separate female beach.Menahem and father bathe in the Dead Sea,but when the time for prayer comes round the rabbi moves off further up the beach,inland on a raised platform of rock,having beseeched Menahem to hurry and catch up. Menahem collects his belongings and takes them towards where his father is praying,drops them,then turns back to collect something he left or just to explore.While the rabbi is absorbed in leading prayer, he loses sight and contact with his son. Search parties are sent out and a helicopter.Later his son's drowned body is found.In his sermon in the synagogue, the rabbi is overcome with speechless grief.His wife says to him she would never have let Menahem out of her sight.The rabbi replies he was holding prayer as this took precedence over everything.His slavish devotion to the straight and narrow path of the Torah has left him vulnerable with a human failing in natural instincts of care.There is no suggestion the family are not loving.This family who do not question their faith,are tested by the tragedy at its core.The movie puts the same question,hints at he the sacrifice of Abraham and Isaac. Menahem's human wonder and curiosity free him from patriarchal might and orthodox belief. It compares the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac,in which a father agrees to sacrifice his son to the Lord and is given a last-minute reprieve, to the rabbi's loss of Menachem, in which God does not save the boy. Religiosity informed the rabbi's relationships with his family, and the results were sad, but neither cruel nor unloving.A parable showing over preoccupation to the rigors(`laws')of faith,can destroys one's empathy.The father may think it's wrong to weep on the sabbath,or that the son died because he wasn't at prayer.The acting is magnificent.",5,In the letter or in the spirit,1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,3097,"['film', 'made', 'great', 'simplicity', 'coherence.The', 'orthodox', 'rabbi', 'who', 'Haredi', 'Hassidic', 'community', 'giving', 'sermons', 'God', 'absolute', 'love', 'humans', 'who', 'are', 'Jewish', 'follow', 'Torah.He', 'deeply', 'loved', 'wife', 'pre-Mitzvah', 'son', 'Menahem', 'Ilan', 'Griff', '.The', 'young', 'boy', 'respectful', 'father', 'place', 'synagogue', 'where', 'father', 'all-knowing', 'eloquence', 'asleep.His', 'wife', 'Esther', 'Bar', 'Menahem', 'dearly', 'love', 'father', 'reverently.She', 'intervenes', 'when', 'Abraham', 'Dayan', 'Menahem', 'keeping', 'picture', 'idol', 'worship', 'amongst', 'primitive', 'people', 'telling', 'rip', 'up', 'picture.The', 'rabbi', 'also', 'irritated', 'Menahem', 'animals', 'have', 'souls', 'seeing', 'dog', 'slavish', 'loyalty', 'owner', 'taken', 'away', 'ambulance.This', 'film', 'made', 'hand', 'held', 'digital', 'cameras', 'music', 'great', 'tenderness', 'empathy.Menahem', 'curious', 'natural', 'world', 'studying', 'dove', 'nest', 'chicks.His', 'father', 'mother', 'dove', 'depart', 'commandment', 'Torah', 'leaving', 'chicks', 'fend', 'themselves.Menahem', 'wonders', 'what', 'will', 'become', 'chicks', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'mother.The', 'rabbi', 'God', 'merciful.However', 'trip', 'Dead', 'Sea', 'Menahem', 'mother', 'separated', 'according', 'rules', 'men', 'separate', 'female', 'beach.Menahem', 'father', 'bathe', 'Dead', 'Sea', 'when', 'time', 'prayer', 'round', 'rabbi', 'off', 'further', 'up', 'beach', 'inland', 'raised', 'platform', 'rock', 'having', 'beseeched', 'Menahem', 'hurry', 'catch', 'up', 'Menahem', 'belongings', 'towards', 'where', 'father', 'praying', 'then', 'back', 'collect', 'something', 'left', 'just', 'explore.While', 'rabbi', 'absorbed', 'leading', 'prayer', 'sight', 'contact', 'son', 'Search', 'parties', 'are', 'sent', 'out', 'helicopter.Later', 'son', 'drowned', 'body', 'found.In', 'sermon', 'synagogue', 'rabbi', 'overcome', 'speechless', 'grief.His', 'wife', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'let', 'Menahem', 'sight.The', 'rabbi', 'replies', 'was', 'holding', 'prayer', 'took', 'precedence', 'everything.His', 'slavish', 'devotion', 'straight', 'narrow', 'path', 'Torah', 'left', 'vulnerable', 'human', 'failing', 'natural', 'instincts', 'care.There', 'suggestion', 'family', 'are', 'not', 'loving.This', 'family', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'question', 'faith', 'are', 'tested', 'tragedy', 'core.The', 'movie', 'same', 'question', 'hints', 'sacrifice', 'Abraham', 'Isaac', 'Menahem', 'human', 'wonder', 'curiosity', 'free', 'patriarchal', 'might', 'orthodox', 'belief', 'biblical', 'story', 'Abraham', 'Isaac', 'father', 'sacrifice', 'son', 'Lord', 'given', 'last-minute', 'reprieve', 'rabbi', 'loss', 'Menachem', 'God', 'not', 'save', 'boy', 'Religiosity', 'informed', 'rabbi', 'relationships', 'family', 'results', 'were', 'sad', 'cruel', 'unloving.A', 'parable', 'showing', 'preoccupation', 'rigors', 'laws', 'faith', 'can', 'destroys', 'one', 'empathy.The', 'father', 'may', 'think', 'wrong', 'weep', 'sabbath', 'son', 'died', 'was', ""n't"", 'prayer.The', 'acting', 'magnificent']",My Father My Lord
