Hornblower is in jail and being visited by Commodore Pellew (his former captain).  Hornblower is accused of mutiny!  The remainder of the movie takes place in the past with Horatio, 4th Lt. Kennedy, Styles, and Matthews now on board the HMS Renown (a 78-gun warship, much larger than his previous ship).  Through the course of the episode, it becomes apparent that the ship's captain is losing his mental abilities causing the senior officers much concern.  By the end of the episode, a very reluctant ship's doctor is forced to declare the captain unfit for command while the Renown comes under heavy fire from a Spanish fort.&quot;Retribution&quot; starts with Commodore Pellew revealed to be one of three officers hearing the court martial proceedings.  The episode is a series of flashbacks as various characters are question by the board.  All of these flashbacks take place immediately after the incidents in &quot;Mutiny.&quot; The senior officers of the Renown decided that if they are going to face a court martial anyway when the get back to port, they might as well do some good by taking the Spanish fort.  This they do thanks to Hornblower's cleverness.  But soon the English are forced to abandon the fort when they discover the Spanish have been under siege for months by an army of revolting slaves.  The episode gets deeper with 1st Lt. Buckland, now in command of Renown, showing that he's not a very good commander.  Hornblower has the respect of most of the men and Buckland becomes slightly jealous of this fact.  By the time the Renown gets back to port, Hornblower has even managed to win the respect of a low-level officer (midshipman?) named Hobbs who'd been fiercely loyal to Captain Sawyer and who'd hated Hornblower for his part in removing the captain from command.Ultimately both of these movies are about loyalty -- loyalty to one's captain, loyalty to one's shipmates, loyalty to one's country, and finally the loyalty that the crew have/come to have for 3rd Lt. Hornblower.

579513,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00005B1VL,C. B Collins Jr.,"[2, 2]","The Horatio Hornblower adventure continues indeed in this two DVD package that tells the long but fascinting story of Lt. Hornblower's struggles serving under Captain Sawyer, a once great hero who is now gradually losing his mind and has paranoid delusions. Thus the episode ""Mutiny"" and the episode ""Retribution"" tell one continuous story.Captain Sawyer's dementia is soon spotted by all four of his leutenants. HOwever the first senior leutenant is an incompetent, indecisive, timid, careerist. This means that when control of the ship is assumed by the young officers, the new leader is just as problematic in his own way as was Captain Sawyer.Underneath all the bravery and action is an important theme. This theme has to do with loyalty and the strength of loyalty. The old heroic Captain Sawyer has men who have fought for him for years and worship him. Thus, they are not inclined to recognize his growing dementia and are in fact familiar with his robust leadership style. They see the young bright leutenants as upstarts and mutineers. Thus the crisis in strong leadership leads to factions and divisions which weakens the entire enterprise. When Sawyer is replaced by an incompetent,the conflicts continue.The first episode ""Mutiny"" is very engaging as you see the struggle between Hornblower and Sawyer. However the second episode ""Retribution"" has a terrific ending with the incredible loyalty of Lt. Archie Kennedy demonstrated for Lt. Hornblower.It is the aspects of dominance, leadership, loyalty, judgement that lies behind these 2 episodes and these films explore these fascinating concepts very well. Of course we get all the daring do of Ioan Gruffudd playing the role of Horatio Hornblower somewhat as if he were an 18th century James Bond, but all the wild dramatics and action add to the underlying theme of loyalty that is the infrastructure of the entire plot.",5,Leadership and loyalty put to the test.,1193184000,"10 24, 2007",2007,1884,"['Horatio', 'Hornblower', 'adventure', 'indeed', 'two', 'DVD', 'package', 'long', 'fascinting', 'story', 'Lt.', 'Hornblower', 'struggles', 'serving', 'Captain', 'Sawyer', 'once', 'great', 'hero', 'who', 'now', 'gradually', 'losing', 'mind', 'paranoid', 'delusions', 'Thus', 'episode', 'Mutiny', 'episode', 'Retribution', 'tell', 'one', 'continuous', 'story.Captain', 'Sawyer', 'dementia', 'soon', 'spotted', 'four', 'leutenants', 'HOwever', 'first', 'senior', 'leutenant', 'incompetent', 'indecisive', 'timid', 'careerist', 'when', 'control', 'ship', 'assumed', 'young', 'officers', 'new', 'leader', 'just', 'as', 'problematic', 'own', 'way', 'was', 'Captain', 'Sawyer.Underneath', 'bravery', 'action', 'important', 'theme', 'theme', 'do', 'loyalty', 'strength', 'loyalty', 'old', 'heroic', 'Captain', 'Sawyer', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'fought', 'years', 'worship', 'Thus', 'are', 'not', 'inclined', 'recognize', 'growing', 'dementia', 'are', 'fact', 'familiar', 'robust', 'leadership', 'style', 'see', 'young', 'bright', 'leutenants', 'upstarts', 'mutineers', 'Thus', 'crisis', 'strong', 'leadership', 'factions', 'divisions', 'weakens', 'entire', 'enterprise', 'When', 'Sawyer', 'replaced', 'incompetent', 'conflicts', 'continue.The', 'first', 'episode', 'Mutiny', 'very', 'engaging', 'see', 'struggle', 'Hornblower', 'Sawyer', 'However', 'second', 'episode', 'Retribution', 'terrific', 'ending', 'incredible', 'loyalty', 'Lt.', 'Archie', 'Kennedy', 'demonstrated', 'Lt.', 'Hornblower.It', 'aspects', 'dominance', 'leadership', 'loyalty', 'judgement', '2', 'episodes', 'films', 'explore', 'fascinating', 'concepts', 'very', 'well', 'course', 'get', 'daring', 'do', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'playing', 'role', 'Horatio', 'Hornblower', 'somewhat', 'were', '18th', 'century', 'James', 'Bond', 'wild', 'dramatics', 'action', 'add', 'underlying', 'theme', 'loyalty', 'infrastructure', 'entire', 'plot']",Horatio Hornblower - The Adventure Continues
579514,A31AY0PVU5V8OG,B00005B1VL,"Charles F. Kartman ""ckartman""","[8, 8]","Those already familiar with A&amp;E's Hornblower series, which this set continues, know that it deals with the early days of a Nelsonian hero, drawn from the novels of C.S. Forester.  Reading the series is best done young, before tackling the wonderfully more literary but still derivative works of Patrick O'Brien.  (Alexander Kent, Dudley Pope, and Richard Woodman are also quite worthwhile.)  And the Forester series, like all of its offspring, is best savored whole rather than piecemeal.  One comes to care not only about the central figure but also about all of the others who surround him in successive books.  This characteristic is well captured by the ensemble cast of the A&amp;E series.  In fact, their promotions through merit can be quite satisfying to the reader of the books.  One should be warned, however, that the A&amp;E series represents only the early days of Hornblower thus far, and thus the most compelling adventures, to my mind at least, are still ahead.  By this I mean the episodes in which Hornblower commands his own ship, which should be of increasing size as the series progresses.  &quot;The Adventure Continues&quot; contains two chapters of a unified story.  Unlike the preceding four chapters, which were episodic and could be easily viewed independently of one another, this set requires one to watch them in order.  The story is wonderful, and amply described elsewhere.  We are already devoted to the principal characters such as Ioan Gruffudd, or we wouldn't be watching, would we?  So I would like to single out the performance of David Warner as the once-great captain who has declined into madness, and who must be declared unfit in order for the &quot;Renown&quot; and its crew to survive.  Warner occupies this critically central role superbly, and makes all else believable.  Also notable to naval enthusiasts is that the &quot;Renown&quot; is a ship of the line, not a smaller frigate.  There are more people in the battle scenes, and the great power of this class of ship can be sensed even at this remove.  In sum, there cannot be any readers of the aforementioned series of novels of Napoleonic naval war who will not love the A&amp;E series, and for those who come to it without prior interest in the subject but find themselves captured by the gripping storiesand fine acting, I can only say that I envy the pleasures that lie ahead in the many books that they now have before them.",5,C.

So, this review will be based solely on the merits of the movies.Having seen the whole series, I may be inclined to say that *Retribution* is my favorite. And this is not because the plot is the best--in fact, the first set of movies were perhaps better in this regard. But there was a strength in this set, especially the latter, that drew me in.That strength came in the form of the characters themselves. To say that this was because of fine acting would be redundant as so many of the other reviewers have pointed this out. Yet what I've seen mentioned so little is the presence of strong emotion. One would think that that fine naval code, the strict sense of rank, would leave scarce room for feeling. So why is it that when Pellew lets slip how much he cares for Hornblower I found myself in that vague state of misty smiles? The bond between the men, all of the men, is at its most touching here. And I found myself reacting more to that than anything else in the series(even though the action was stirring and the sense of suspense sweet.)I was thoroughly pleased with the series as a whole and *The Adventure Continues* offered even more entertainment.

579521,A73UC8G7MT5X0,B00005B1VL,Karl May,"[5, 13]","My original two-star review: As a Hornblower fan for many decades, I am very disappointed in this movie. Ioan Gruffud portrays a Hornblower who is almost a modern high school delinquent - the kind who walks in front of your car when you drive near a public HS to show he is ""cool"" or a ""big man"". Whereas this may appeal to someone who sports a ""Question Authority"" sticker, it is not the Hornblower I know. Overall, it seems that the movies did not do too well with one of the greatest heroes of fiction - but at least Gregory Peck's Hornblower was decent - this one is not quite the material from which a Commodore Hornblower is made... The kind of person portrayed by Gruffud is, above all, childish (as we all know, ""cool"" is the same as ""cute"").

Forrester's works but I thoroughly enjoyed the A&amp;E/BBC ""Horatio Hornblower"" series.  I have to admit that I was first drawn to the series because of Ioan Gruffudd (whom I admired in ""Great Expectations"" and ""Titanic"") but soon found myself hooked because of the gripping storylines, great action and impressive production values (set, costumes, casting, etc.).In ""Mutiny,"" Hornblower and fellow officers are accused of mutiny against the increasingly unstable and sadistic Capt. Sawyer.  In ""Retribution,"" Hornblower must prove his innocence and an important battle against the Spanish puts his and his fellow shipmates lives in grave danger.This follow-up series is just as impressive as the original (which came out in 1999).  It brings back characters such as Sir Edward Pellew (Robert Lindsey), Lt. Kennedy (Jamie Bamber), Mathews (Paul Copley) and Styles (Sean Gilder). This series also introduces us to some memorable characters (and great actors) such as Lt. Bush (Paul McGann of ""Our Mutual Friend""), Dr. Clive (David Rintoul who played Mr. Darcy in the 1985 ""Pride and Prejudice""), Capt. Sawyer (wonderfully portrayed by David Warner of ""Titanic"") and Midshipman Wellard (newcomer Terence Corrigan).As always, Ioan Gruffudd is in excellent form and I hope A&amp;E/BBC will continue to bring us more of  ""Horatio Hornblower!""",5,Another terrific series from A&amp;E/BBC!!

It is an excellent adaptation of the LT Hornblower book with the follow up written by Forrester (the letter of Admiral Hornblower telling the truth about what happened).  The movie develops ship board life more fully and we are made to live on board seeing how each of the different ratings actually lived as opposed to the more sanitised view of the Hornblower with Gregory Peck (which I liked as well but for different reasons)It is an excellent exploration of how damaging a command structure can be if all of the officers are not in sync.  Another excellent treatment of this topic is Damn the Defiant with Guiness as the Captain and Bogarde his First Lieutenant.As with Hornblower in general the plot is a bit to pat (Damn the Defiant is probably a better story)but that may be the result of the fact that I first read it more than 30 years ago so it holds no surprizes for me.I thought the battle scenes featuring the ships were nicely done...better than the first ones in the series.  They are now using ships appropriate to the time period.  (In the first of the series they were nice but looked like they should have been in the Seven Years War.)But I will admit to being a fan of the genre so I will buy anything having to do with wooden ships...this is certainly one I think any other fan should own.,5,Excellent adaptation of Lt Hornblower,1008201600,"12 13, 2001",2001,1359,"['think', 'best', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'excellent', 'adaptation', 'LT', 'Hornblower', 'book', 'follow', 'up', 'written', 'Forrester', 'letter', 'Admiral', 'Hornblower', 'telling', 'truth', 'what', 'happened', 'movie', 'ship', 'board', 'life', 'more', 'fully', 'are', 'made', 'live', 'board', 'seeing', 'how', 'different', 'ratings', 'actually', 'lived', 'opposed', 'more', 'sanitised', 'view', 'Hornblower', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'liked', 'as', 'well', 'different', 'reasons', 'excellent', 'exploration', 'how', 'damaging', 'command', 'structure', 'can', 'be', 'officers', 'are', 'not', 'sync', 'excellent', 'treatment', 'topic', 'Damn', 'Defiant', 'Guiness', 'Captain', 'Bogarde', 'First', 'Lieutenant.As', 'Hornblower', 'general', 'plot', 'bit', 'pat', 'Damn', 'Defiant', 'probably', 'better', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'result', 'fact', 'first', 'read', 'more', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'surprizes', 'me.I', 'thought', 'battle', 'featuring', 'ships', 'were', 'nicely', 'done', 'better', 'first', 'ones', 'series', 'are', 'now', 'using', 'ships', 'appropriate', 'time', 'period', 'first', 'series', 'were', 'nice', 'looked', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Seven', 'Years', 'War', 'will', 'admit', 'being', 'fan', 'genre', 'will', 'buy', 'anything', 'having', 'do', 'wooden', 'ships', 'certainly', 'one', 'think', 'other', 'fan', 'should', 'own']",Horatio Hornblower - The Adventure Continues

579528,A17BT73RVRQYSP,B00005B1VL,Peter Ingemi,"[19, 23]","This second set of films adapting the adventures of a younger Horatio Hornblower has its strengths and weaknesses.  It's strengths comes from strong performances, particularly from David Warner (Captian Sawyer) and Phil Glensler (Hobbs).  The screenplay expands and fleshes out both of these men who were minor character in the book (Lieutenant Hornblower).  Hornblower seem to take Bush's role as the defender of the Captian while Archie (Who doesn't appear in the book)provides a stark contrast.  The promotion of both Styles and Matthews and their interaction makes for more interesting action and character development.  In fact the only characters the don't seem to develop are the heros of the actual book (Hornblower and Bush) Neither seem to be played to their fullest but I see more a problem in the writing then the acting.  In fairness I think Warner and Glensler steal the show.  Buckland is painted as totally incompatent which just doen't jibe with the way things worked in the RN.  In addition the gratuious inclusion of Pellew and two sappy scenes concerning Welland and Sawyer and the Buckland and Hornblower doesn't do the series credit.  Granted the movie doesn't end in the same spot as the book but I felt a bit cheeted.  Of coure as a rule the movie is never better than the book and the book is first rate.  For a Hornblower fanatic like myself it doesn't quite make 5 stars (Though the supporting cast almost lifts it there)just a mere pleasure, but for those who don't know the series it is a definate winner.",4,Characters Characters Characters,991526400,"06 3, 2001",2001,1534,"['second', 'set', 'films', 'adapting', 'adventures', 'younger', 'Horatio', 'Hornblower', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'strengths', 'strong', 'performances', 'particularly', 'David', 'Warner', 'Captian', 'Sawyer', 'Phil', 'Glensler', 'Hobbs', 'screenplay', 'out', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'minor', 'character', 'book', 'Lieutenant', 'Hornblower', 'Hornblower', 'seem', 'take', 'Bush', 'role', 'defender', 'Captian', 'Archie', 'Who', ""n't"", 'appear', 'book', 'stark', 'contrast', 'promotion', 'Styles', 'Matthews', 'interaction', 'more', 'interesting', 'action', 'character', 'development', 'fact', 'only', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'develop', 'are', 'heros', 'actual', 'book', 'Hornblower', 'Bush', 'seem', 'be', 'played', 'fullest', 'see', 'more', 'problem', 'writing', 'then', 'acting', 'fairness', 'think', 'Warner', 'Glensler', 'steal', 'show', 'Buckland', 'painted', 'totally', 'incompatent', 'just', 'doe', ""n't"", 'jibe', 'way', 'things', 'worked', 'RN', 'addition', 'gratuious', 'inclusion', 'Pellew', 'two', 'sappy', 'scenes', 'concerning', 'Welland', 'Sawyer', 'Buckland', 'Hornblower', ""n't"", 'do', 'series', 'credit', 'Granted', 'movie', ""n't"", 'end', 'same', 'spot', 'book', 'felt', 'bit', 'cheeted', 'coure', 'rule', 'movie', 'never', 'better', 'book', 'book', 'first', 'rate', 'Hornblower', 'fanatic', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', '5', 'stars', 'supporting', 'cast', 'almost', 'just', 'mere', 'pleasure', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'series', 'definate', 'winner']",Horatio Hornblower - The Adventure Continues
