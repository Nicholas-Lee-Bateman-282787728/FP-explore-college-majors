988677,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000FEBZ0A,A Customer,"[3, 4]","Freedomland is just such a monumental misfire; it's hard to know where to start. It's a herky-jerky, convoluted and totally overwrought thriller that tries to present themes of child endangerment, racial antagonism and police brutality, and mob violence. The film tries so hard to bring these issues together, but it never really finds its footing.What was Julianne Moore thinking when she decided to do this role? Moore - who is one of America's greatest actresses - gives one of the worst performances of her career.  Wildly miscast as a grammatically challenged former drug addict, the actress wanders through much of the movie in a bug-eyed, doped up daze, stopping every now and then to deliver a morsel of exposition about how ""she's just trying to do right by her kid.""Moore plays Brenda Martin a working class mom who has staggered into the ER of the Dempsey Medical Center, babbling about a dark night, a surprise car jacking, and an unknown black assailant. Only after hours of interrogation does Brenda confess that her precious 4-year-old son Cody was asleep in the back of the stolen car.The chief investigating officer Lorenzo Council (Samuel L. Jackson) is suspicious as Brenda seems terribly confused and the pieces just don't fit. Given the nature of the crime, the racial angle and Brenda's status as part of the police family - her brother is a detective in a neighboring suburb - law enforcement and the media go on full alert.Brenda is beloved in Dempsey, where she teaches disadvantaged kindergartners. She's also a former druggie telling a story that's less than credible. When the police cordon off the projects to squeeze out the alleged perpetrator, community leaders disparage the onslaught and official indifference when black kids fall in harm's way. Soon the town is incensed and set to riot.Freedomland starts off quite well, the film is bathed in a gritty sensibility and the action has a real sense of immediacy. However, it all starts to fall apart in the second act - plot points are introduced and left dangling, and characters who are involved throughout simply disappear through a large part of the story.The film also suffers from being pompous and self important and the laughs really come when the film hastily tries to redeem itself with a tenuous connection to a shifty area known as Freedomland, where generations of neglected, abused and forgotten children have left their ghostly mark.When the final denouement comes and we get to learn what really happened to cute young Cody, most viewers will realize that Brenda's endless self-conscious posturing was quite unnecessary, and her actions that night didn't make a lot of sense. Monologues rattle on for minutes, stopping the story dead and director Joe Roth presents these in such unblinking close-ups that the crazed actors turn their voices up so they can constantly rage and scream.Freedomland is a huge embarrassment for all involved - no wonder they bought it out in the early part of the year, widely considered the dumping ground for all the junk Hollywood films.

Jackson in Freedomland, a movie riding on the social sensitivities of films like Crash no doubt, it was strange to say the least.The movie revolves around investigations of a missing boy and the tensions caused by the fact that he's white and his alleged abductors black. You've got a black cop trying to solve a case and prevent all-out rioting between white cops and a black neighbourhood they locked down to ferret out the culprit. You've got a distraught not-quite-there mother whose story doesn't feel entirely right. Throw in the tempers flaring up on all sides and of course you've got a very intense movie portraying themes like parental responsibility, community cohesion, peace-making (within a racial context) and - unique among mainstream productions - the question of a personal loving all-providing god (and not merely about the existence of some ""transcendent Meta-Being"").Not that the movie is any distance from an 'R' rating - it's got at least two dozen strongly emphasized 'F' - words and a fair amount of violence (though not much gore).Julianne Moore's acting was so believable I was repulsed somewhat by her character which undoubtedly stood out. That she played a teacher (and a very good one, too) probably caused some unwanted resonance with my background. Jackson's compassion, confused but verbally tough role, however, won't win him any more fans than those who prefer his super-cool symbolisms in Shaft, Pulp Fiction and so on.Not your average detective thriller, ironically making Freedomland more worth watching and thinking through, especially on the issue on what true freedom is all about.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 3]","I've got a headache...How ...when ...who is responsible for this ridiculous movie!The fact that this film actually got made should leave little doubt in the viewers' minds that someone, somewhere in Hollywood has their head so far up their behind they wouldn't know a good script if it landed on their stool-smeared face.That respectable actors Julianne Moore (THE HOURS) and Samuel L. Jackson (THE INCREDIBLES) signed up for this trite contraption should also leave viewers scratching their heads (although Jackson recently did SNAKES ON A PLANE, which further puts his stardom in question)!The movie's premise: Brenda Martin (Moore) enters an emergency room in northern New Jersey claiming she's been carjacked. It just so happens, too, that the guy who carjacked her was colored and this theft occurred in the Armstrong District, a predominantly black area. Lorenzo Council (Jackson) goes to the ER to get a statement and Ms. Martin drops a bombshell: her four-year-old son, Cody, was in the backseat when it was stolen. To add further fuel to this fizzling fire is the fact that Ms. Martin's brother, Danny (Ron Eldard, BLACK HAWK DOWN) is a cop on the local police force.The Armstrong District is sealed off, igniting racial tensions between the black community and the mostly white police presence. ""Why haven't we seen this kind of response whenever a black kid goes missing?"" is the commonly heard racial cliche.As the story progresses we learn that Brenda Martin isn't all she seems to be (shock!) Could she be responsible for her own son's death?This is old material covered many times. And this time it's done so poorly it's laughable. Samuel L. Jackson's cop character is initially introduced as a sickly detective with poor asthma control. We see him get adrenaline shots and use his inhalers ...and then he's fine for the rest of the film. Why even introduce this rubbish if you're not going to use it later on?Julianne Moore stumbles through scenes like a crack-ho looking for her pipe. She's a lovable mommy one minute and a raving psycho the next.The rest of the story has so many holes as to be compared with swiss cheese. Freedomland itself is an old children's detention center fallen into ruin where a search for Cody takes place. But it has absolutely NOTHING to do with the main story (which is about racial tensions and false accusations). A woman who is involved in finding missing children suddenly pops up and assists Jackson but she's more of a psychoanalyst than a finder of lost kids. Why?! Couldn't Samuel L. Jackson have gotten that information out of her?!This stupid, ludicrous, and mind-numbing film should be avoided like the blight it is.I need some Tylenol!",1,Who Green-Lighted This Putrid Flick!,1154649600,"08 4, 2006",2006,2695,"[""'ve"", 'got', 'headache', 'How', 'when', 'who', 'responsible', 'ridiculous', 'movie', 'fact', 'film', 'actually', 'got', 'made', 'should', 'leave', 'little', 'doubt', 'viewers', 'minds', 'someone', 'somewhere', 'Hollywood', 'head', 'so', 'far', 'up', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'good', 'script', 'landed', 'stool-smeared', 'face.That', 'respectable', 'actors', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'THE', 'HOURS', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'THE', 'INCREDIBLES', 'signed', 'up', 'trite', 'contraption', 'should', 'also', 'leave', 'viewers', 'scratching', 'heads', 'Jackson', 'recently', 'did', 'SNAKES', 'ON', 'A', 'PLANE', 'further', 'stardom', 'question', 'movie', 'premise', 'Brenda', 'Martin', 'Moore', 'emergency', 'room', 'northern', 'New', 'Jersey', 'claiming', 'been', 'carjacked', 'just', 'so', 'happens', 'too', 'guy', 'who', 'carjacked', 'was', 'colored', 'theft', 'occurred', 'Armstrong', 'District', 'predominantly', 'black', 'area', 'Lorenzo', 'Council', 'Jackson', 'ER', 'get', 'statement', 'Ms.', 'Martin', 'bombshell', 'four-year-old', 'son', 'Cody', 'was', 'backseat', 'when', 'was', 'stolen', 'add', 'further', 'fuel', 'fizzling', 'fire', 'fact', 'Ms.', 'Martin', 'brother', 'Danny', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'BLACK', 'HAWK', 'DOWN', 'cop', 'local', 'police', 'force.The', 'Armstrong', 'District', 'sealed', 'off', 'igniting', 'racial', 'tensions', 'black', 'community', 'mostly', 'white', 'police', 'presence', 'Why', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'kind', 'response', 'whenever', 'black', 'kid', 'missing', 'commonly', 'heard', 'racial', 'cliche.As', 'story', 'learn', 'Brenda', 'Martin', ""n't"", 'be', 'shock', 'Could', 'be', 'responsible', 'own', 'son', 'death', 'old', 'material', 'covered', 'many', 'times', 'time', 'done', 'so', 'poorly', 'laughable', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'cop', 'character', 'initially', 'introduced', 'sickly', 'detective', 'poor', 'asthma', 'control', 'see', 'get', 'adrenaline', 'shots', 'use', 'inhalers', 'then', 'fine', 'rest', 'film', 'Why', 'even', 'introduce', 'rubbish', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'use', 'later', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'stumbles', 'scenes', 'crack-ho', 'looking', 'pipe', 'lovable', 'mommy', 'one', 'minute', 'raving', 'psycho', 'next.The', 'rest', 'story', 'so', 'many', 'holes', 'be', 'compared', 'swiss', 'cheese', 'Freedomland', 'old', 'children', 'detention', 'center', 'fallen', 'ruin', 'where', 'search', 'Cody', 'place', 'absolutely', 'NOTHING', 'do', 'main', 'story', 'racial', 'tensions', 'false', 'accusations', 'woman', 'who', 'involved', 'finding', 'missing', 'children', 'suddenly', 'up', 'assists', 'Jackson', 'more', 'psychoanalyst', 'finder', 'lost', 'kids', 'Why', 'Could', ""n't"", 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'have', 'gotten', 'information', 'stupid', 'ludicrous', 'mind-numbing', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'avoided', 'blight', 'Tylenol']",Freedomland
988683,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000FEBZ0A,Chris Pandolfi,"[12, 13]","The way I see it, a good movie has to have a sturdy structure in order to support the weight of its characters and plot. If this idea falls through, then all you'll have is an incoherent mess. ""Freedomland,"" unfortunately, falls into this category. It had so many missing pieces that its structure pretty much collapsed the moment it started. No, that's actually too limiting: the pieces were never together to begin with. Everything about this film was out of place and chaotic, a haphazardly strewn together story that only resulted in a jumbled mass of wrongfully conceived ideas.The movie begins in the streets of an urban housing project in Dempsy, New Jersey. There we meet Lorenzo Council (Samuel L. Jackson), a police detective who seems to know everyone in the neighborhood but isn't exactly up to speed on all of its problems. One of the women continually nags him to do something about her abusive boyfriend, and Council continually tells her that he'll take care of it as soon as he can. Right from the start, he seems burned out and detached, something that other officers have picked up on. They were noticeably standoffish and haughty. Obviously, some would rather not work with him. Exactly why is never really explained, a fact that only serves to make the many moments of mounting tension and hostility seem ill fitting.Council is thrown into a web of mystery when Brenda Martin (Julianne Moore) walks into Dempsy Medical Center. Her hands are covered in blood, and she's mentally cut off from the world. Council is called in to question her. For a while she's evasive, and occasionally seems to be rambling. Eventually, she says that, while taking a shortcut through the park next to the housing project, she was carjacked by a black man. She also says that her son, Cody, was still inside the car.This prompts the complete shutdown of the neighborhood, an act that angers many of the residents (usually to the point of physical altercations). No one is allowed to enter or leave. As if this weren't bad enough, Council's personal interest in finding Brenda's missing son has landed him in hot water with his superiors. Brenda's brother, Danny (Ron Eldard), is also not too fond of Council. We never really find out why, though. Maybe it's because he's also a police detective. Or maybe it's because of the past he shared with his sister. But these are only guesses; everyone in this movie is so one-dimensional that guesses are all we have to go on. This is especially true of Danny; his appearances are so sparse that his inclusion was completely unnecessary.Council becomes increasingly suspicious of Brenda; he notices that many of her claims don't seem to add up. Right from the start, it's obvious that there's more to Brenda than meets the eye. It continues all the way through the film, most prominently displayed through her never-ending mental patient type of behavior. She's constantly walking around in a confused stupor, and there never seems to be a moment when her cheeks aren't wet with tears. Julianne Moore delivers a performance that's nothing more than overacting, and it very quickly becomes exhausting to watch her. By the time I got to the ending, I'd lost all traces of compassion for her. She was one of those characters I wished I could slap in the face while screaming, ""Snap out of it!""One of the film's biggest problems is the number of subplots that are left dangling before I had a chance to experience them. Let me give you an example: we eventually learn that Council has a son in prison named Jason (Dorian Massick). The moments they're together are presented so insignificantly that it comes off as nothing more than filler material. Had this subplot been followed through, it could have been powerful and dramatic. Here's another example: we're introduced to a group of women dedicated to finding lost or abducted children. In charge of the group is the dedicated Karen Collucci (Edie Falco). Her personal story (which I won't reveal) is somewhat compelling, but it was brought up too late in the game for me to take any real interest. Even the location of Freedomland, a padlocked and abandoned children's asylum, remains in the shadows. Its only significance is that it doubles as the film's title.This is one of those movies that can't decide what it wants to be. On the one hand, we have the mystery surrounding Brenda and the search for her missing son. On the other hand, we have a commentary on race relations between blacks and whites. These are fine in and of themselves, but put together, they're completely incompatible (at least they were in this film). Even more unsettling is the way race is portrayed. There have certainly been plenty of films that tackle the subject of race in effective, thought provoking ways. But in this case it comes off as a way to exploit negative, unfounded stereotypes. We have the abusive boyfriend who smuggles drugs. We have the strong willed community leader who takes an aggressive stand against authority figures (at one point, he distributes t-shirts displaying the suspect's sketch, claiming the face represents all and none of the people). We even have the obligatory riot scene between the residents and law enforcement. While all this manages to convey the point that the road to understanding and tolerance is rocky and turbulent, it still fails to instill compassion. Maybe if it had actually connected with the story of Cody and his mother, it might have had some merit.""Freedomland"" unfairly left me with more questions than answers and cruelly twisted my anticipation into disappointment. I resented the fact that I had to leave the theater without gaining some minute sliver of insight.

Probably the only half decent part of the film is the start.Begins with a woman staggering into a hospital dazed and with bloodied hands who says that she has been car-jacked.  Soon she reveals that her son is on board the car and suddenly a full scale kidnapping investigation begins.What makes the film different is that it is a white female who has been car-jacked and the man who took her car an African American.  The location of the crime was also in a black area of the city resulting in racial tensions both from the police and local community.There is really little if anything positive to say about this film.  These are decent actors but the acting is frankly awful.  Samuel Jackson plays a detective who on discovering a child is missing drags the mother into a private room of the hospital, screams at her, hyperventilates (This all prior to him getting a statement in a crowded hospital full of patents (Ever thought of pulling a screen or putting her in a private room?)) Then gives some half baked report over the radio.The film gets worse.  The female victim just happens to be related to a detective who seems to have full authority to 'lock down' an entire neighbourhood (Granted with his bosses permission) Not allowing residents in or out of the neighbourhood.  The police then go about beating and arresting at will while local community leaders bait the uniformed officers.Samuel Jackson seems to have little control of what is happening and even less on the victim who he is protecting.  She wanders off, is driven back into the scene of the crime (This in an area supposedly under lock down) where she wanders around at will (Even being accosted by a local)  When our detective needs to go back to the station what does he do? Drops her off with a local friend (Yes in the same neighbourhood where the crime was committed) while he goes downtown for a chat.It just gets worse, the interview consists of Jackson having a chat with no tape running, no caution, nothing.  Riot ensures with injuries on both sides (Don't Police wear riot gear in the States?)This film really is so bad it makes Snakes on a Plane look like a classic.

988694,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000FEBZ0A,Grady Harp,"[3, 5]","Having not read the reviews of the film during theater release or the reviews posted on sites such as this, this viewer placed the DVD in the machine with a tabula rasa approach.  The feeling as the film ended in the only quiet portion of the soundtrack (soft music as sound over a racial riot!) was one of devastation and it created a complete surrender to the story.  Richard Price's novel was a stunner and his personal screen adaptation of his incredible story carries as much bite and weight as did his powerful novel.  The story and film present some heady thoughts that demand some painful participation from the viewer, but the impact is immense.From the moment the film begins, all is stress and loud noise: we witness an incident of a woman Brenda (Julianne Moore) at risk finding her way to a hospital ER with bloody hands, apparently the victim of a carjacking in an area of New Jersey that is a black housing project. Her story describes a young black man who hijacked her car - but the stinger she relates to wise cop Lorenzo Council (Samuel L. Jackson) is that her four-year-old son was in the back seat asleep.  This triggers an investigation of a kidnapping/car jacking and the housing project is locked down: suddenly the fine thin line between blacks and whites is strained and though Brenda has been a volunteer worker in the housing projects school, sides are taken pro and con the police seeming to side with the whites. Brenda's life has been one of abuse and drug addiction, and even her own brother Danny (Ron Eldard) has early doubts as to Brenda's account of the incident.  To make matters worse, Lorenzo is respected in the projects and is called upon to resolve some personal relationship problems between one Felicia (Aunjanue Ellis) and her wayward lover Billy (Anthony Mackie), requests he elects to put on the back burner in favor of getting to the truth about the 'incident'. As Lorenzo valiantly attempts to make order and sense of the mess, a group of women who investigate lost children headed by Karen Colluci (Edie Falco) join the search for Brenda's child.  The twists and turns of how the search becomes an exploration of a gravesite, that exploration slowly plodding through an abandoned asylum for tortured kids called Freedomland, drive the final confessions and realizations to their angst-ridded end.None of this is beautiful: all of it is difficult to watch. But for this viewer the story was gripping and the acting was solid to outstanding.  Julianne Moore once again reveals another side of her talent in depicting injured women; Samuel L. Jackson remains the stalwart, leavening force of nature who despite his own demons and illnesses  remains focused on what he shares is the importance of family; Ron Eldard demonstrates in an ugly role that he remains one of our more under used actors; Edie Falco  delivers Price's soliloquies with uncanny brilliance; William Forsythe, Aunjanue Ellis, and Anthony Mackie shine in fairly small roles.And then I read thoughts of other reviewers, understanding their stances, and wonder why the film seemed so powerful.

It is a long scene, and then there is the scene in the interrogation room. Moore, in many of her films carries either the sword of defense or the sword of kindness. In this movie, she brings us this with a hidden current of desperation. She carries the weight of the film as far as acting goes, and it's easy to admire Samuel L Jackson's character as well. His character is also heroic. They were the perfect fit.I think it is unfair for other reviewers not to see this much in this movie and let it rest. They make too much effort to bash the works of decent people who are trying to make a living doing what they do in all the time constraints that there are. This movie was all in all in the best efforts to the story by everyone behind it. I applaud this movie, and I'm surprised it didn't get much attention when it was in the theater. We just let these pass us by, I don't know why.Freedomland shows us how people react to situations in ways it could be felt, sometimes in extreme circumstances. It is sometimes exhaustive, and you will want the boy to be found. High drama is what writers do in order to keep us interested.

988701,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000FEBZ0A,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[7, 9]","Samuel L. Jackson has long been one of my favorite actors, but has almost made it a habit of choosing really bad roles that don't even try to showcase his talent. In this movie, he returns to form a little bit. Two of the most common roles you see Jackson in are as a bad guy (Jackie Brown, Pulp Fiction) or as a cop/goverment guy (XXX, Freedomland). No matter what he's playing (unless it's in a bad movie) he does it perfectly. ""Freedomland"" is about an asthmatic New Jersey detective named Lorenzo Council, who spends his time trying to keep violence down in a small N.J. city. Then, Brenda Martin (a blonde Julianne Moore) comes into the picture claming that her car was jacked by a black man and that her 4-year old son was in the backseat. Lorenzo feels for Brenda, but also senses something wrong with her story. Anyway, if you've seen the preview for the film then you know that Freedomland is the name of a children's asylum...The preview made this asylum look like a big part of the movie and it's not. The asylum, Freedomland is used as a metaphor more than anything. Edie Falco (The Sopranos) also stars as Karen, a woman who leads a team to help find missing children and Ron Eldard playing the same d**kheaded character he's played in several other movies (House of Sand and Fog, Sleepers). Anyway,the movie gives away it's big secret a little to early although many people will hardly notice. The movie paces nicely for an hour before leading to the big plot points. The dialogue is really good, Jackson sounds like he's saying leftover stuff from ""Jackie Brown"" at times. Moore needs to keep her red hair, but her performance is really good. This is an entertaining movie that also fits in some political views about racism...It's no masterpiece but it's definitely worth checking out.GRADE: A-",5,Freedomland,1150675200,"06 19, 2006",2006,1810,"['Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'long', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'almost', 'made', 'habit', 'choosing', 'really', 'bad', 'roles', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'showcase', 'talent', 'movie', 'form', 'little', 'bit', 'Two', 'most', 'common', 'roles', 'see', 'Jackson', 'are', 'bad', 'guy', 'Jackie', 'Brown', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'cop/goverment', 'guy', 'XXX', 'Freedomland', 'matter', 'what', 'playing', 'bad', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'Freedomland', 'asthmatic', 'New', 'Jersey', 'detective', 'named', 'Lorenzo', 'Council', 'who', 'time', 'trying', 'keep', 'violence', 'down', 'small', 'N.J.', 'city', 'Then', 'Brenda', 'Martin', 'blonde', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'picture', 'claming', 'car', 'was', 'jacked', 'black', 'man', '4-year', 'old', 'son', 'was', 'backseat', 'Lorenzo', 'feels', 'Brenda', 'also', 'something', 'wrong', 'story', 'Anyway', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'preview', 'film', 'then', 'know', 'Freedomland', 'name', 'children', 'asylum', 'preview', 'made', 'asylum', 'look', 'big', 'part', 'movie', 'not', 'asylum', 'Freedomland', 'used', 'metaphor', 'more', 'anything', 'Edie', 'Falco', 'Sopranos', 'also', 'Karen', 'woman', 'who', 'team', 'help', 'find', 'missing', 'children', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'playing', 'same', 'd**kheaded', 'character', 'played', 'several', 'other', 'movies', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'Sleepers', 'Anyway', 'movie', 'away', 'big', 'secret', 'little', 'early', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'hardly', 'notice', 'movie', 'nicely', 'hour', 'leading', 'big', 'plot', 'points', 'dialogue', 'really', 'good', 'Jackson', 'saying', 'leftover', 'stuff', 'Jackie', 'Brown', 'times', 'Moore', 'keep', 'red', 'hair', 'performance', 'really', 'good', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'also', 'political', 'views', 'racism', 'masterpiece', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out.GRADE', 'A-']",Freedomland

988703,A3WIOO9L0DNGZ,B000FEBZ0A,Kevin Major,"[0, 0]","Freedomland tries oh so hard to be both a crime thriller and social commentary that it fails at both.  Instead of insight into the realities of race in America, or an interesting story with creative twists, Freedomland delivers an uneven, ham-fisted movie that is more pretentious than deep.I won't go into the details of the plot.  Other reviews have already done so with great clarity.  I will state, however, that the acting is surprisingly good despite the mostly horrid dialogue.  I felt particularly sympathetic for Julianne Moore.  Her dialogue was a mess, especially during the important moments, such as the big reveal at the end.  It's hard to imagine her wreck of a character switching from surprising eloquence to an almost catatonic state and back again in mere seconds, despite whatever mental instability she may have had.  Some of these sudden shifts in tone and dialogue no doubt stem from the director's sense of artistic license, but in this case less would have definitely generated a better result.The movie itself, from a plot standpoint, is muddled.  Some of it is paint-by-numbers, namely how the racial tension inevitably turns into full-scale riots.  Some of it is just a bit weird, specifically Samuel L. Jackson's character's forgiveness of Moore's character.  His faith aside, it just seems too much of a stretch, especially since his character explicitly comments about how jaded he is in humanity as a whole.  Moore's character, and her selfish choices, seem to be the last possible catalyst for the changes in Jackson's character.  And yet, it still inexplicably happens.Freedomland is definitely a movie delivered with conviction.  It just seems to be confused about what it's actually trying to say.

He polices the Dempsy neighborhood projects, Armstrong Houses, that lie on the dividing line between the whiter/nicer part of town, Gannon.  There is a longstanding feud between Dempsy and Gannon, mostly due to the latter's refusal to stay on their side of the line.  Still, they maintain relative order until a call comes in that a white woman has been carjacked in Armstrong Houses, a story that Council is right to distrust as he is in the projects when the event supposedly takes place.Council goes to the hospital and interviews Brenda Martin, played by Julianne Moore.  Martin tells him that she was carjacked and that her 4 year old son was in the car.  Immediately, Council jumps into action phoning in the police and giving a description of the child.  He also calls Martin's brother, a policeman in Gannon.  When the brother finds out that his nephew is missing he calls in all Gannon forces to create a lockdown in Armstrong Houses, despite the fact that he's out of his jurisdiction.  The impending search and destroy mission enacted by the Gannon police department throws their neighborhood dividing line into all manner of chaos.  Everyone in town is taking sides and no one seems to think that this is about a missing child.Freedomland is everything that Crash wants to be, but with more effective execution and without being trite.  Yes, at times the story lagged and it could have been at least half an hour shorter, but the overall theme was accomplished with grace and alacrity.  I would certainly recommend it to anyone who saw Crash and found it lacking, and I will definitely read the book after viewing this powerful and compelling movie.",4,We are all human,1152489600,"07 10, 2006",2006,1824,"['Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Lorenzo', 'Council', 'New', 'Jersey', 'detective', 'who', 'vested', 'interest', 'keeping', 'children', 'projects', 'trouble', 'jail', 'Dempsy', 'neighborhood', 'projects', 'Armstrong', 'Houses', 'dividing', 'line', 'whiter/nicer', 'part', 'town', 'Gannon', 'longstanding', 'feud', 'Dempsy', 'Gannon', 'mostly', 'due', 'latter', 'refusal', 'stay', 'side', 'line', 'Still', 'maintain', 'relative', 'order', 'call', 'white', 'woman', 'been', 'carjacked', 'Armstrong', 'Houses', 'story', 'Council', 'right', 'distrust', 'projects', 'when', 'event', 'supposedly', 'place.Council', 'hospital', 'interviews', 'Brenda', 'Martin', 'played', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Martin', 'was', 'carjacked', '4', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'was', 'car', 'Immediately', 'Council', 'action', 'phoning', 'police', 'giving', 'description', 'child', 'also', 'Martin', 'brother', 'policeman', 'Gannon', 'When', 'brother', 'out', 'nephew', 'missing', 'Gannon', 'forces', 'create', 'lockdown', 'Armstrong', 'Houses', 'fact', 'jurisdiction', 'impending', 'search', 'destroy', 'mission', 'enacted', 'Gannon', 'police', 'department', 'neighborhood', 'dividing', 'line', 'manner', 'chaos', 'Everyone', 'town', 'taking', 'sides', 'one', 'think', 'missing', 'child.Freedomland', 'everything', 'Crash', 'be', 'more', 'effective', 'execution', 'being', 'trite', 'Yes', 'times', 'story', 'lagged', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'least', 'hour', 'shorter', 'overall', 'theme', 'was', 'accomplished', 'grace', 'alacrity', 'would', 'certainly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'saw', 'Crash', 'found', 'lacking', 'will', 'definitely', 'read', 'book', 'viewing', 'powerful', 'compelling', 'movie']",Freedomland

Jackson that makes me believe his career is on a downhill slide.Freedomland begins interesting enough when Brenda Martin (Julieanne Moore) enters the Dempsey Medical Center ER, hands covered in blood, and finally reveals that she was carjacked in the Armstrong Housing Projects.  Even later she reveals that her four year old son, Cody, was asleep in the backseat of the car.After that, the movie simply slips away from reality (ie, recovering junkie Brenda is handled with kid gloves by police) and any plausible plot.It's my opinion that the writers of this script got a little too focused on the racism issue and forgot to focus on the actual story of missing child.I watched this movie approximately 12 hours ago, and I'm still sitting here saying to myself, ""What?!""

988708,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000FEBZ0A,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 3]","Creating and maintaining a sense of ambiguity in a motion picture is a delicate proposition.  I think of a film like ""K-Pax,"" where we want to believe that just maybe Kevin Spacey's character really is an alien and are confronted by evidence for and against the proposition.  But then there is a film like ""Flightplan,"" where the trailer settles the question of whether Jodie Foster's daughter ever really was on the airplane with a shot of the window at the end of their row.  Throwing away the ambiguity of the situation before the audience has even seen the film seems like an incredibly bad move, but then we live in an age were far too often trailers give away too much (or have all of the best moments) of a film.The fatal flaw in ""Freedomland"" is that the movie throws away the ambiguity, but then has a character that should know better act as if that is not exactly what just happened.  The film opens with Brenda Martin (Julianne Moore) staggering into a hospital with bleeding hands.  She says that her car was hijacked near a housing project.  Detective Lorenzo Council (Samual L. Jackson) is assigned to the case and his first big question is what Brenda was doing driving around in the projects by herself.  Brenda's explanation is that she volunteers at a children's center in the projects and she just made a wrong term on her way home.  Council knows there is something Brenda is not saying, and it appears he is right when she says that here four-year-old son was asleep in the back of the car when it was hijacked.  That declaration changes everything.The dramatic tension in ""Freedomland"" comes not only from the search for the car and the missing boy, but also from the tensions building on the streets of the project.  Community leaders are outraged that once again the police are once again doing everything they can to find a missing white child while never doing half as much when a black child disappears.  Brenda's brother, Danny Martin (Ron Eldard), is a cop, and he is going off the deep end on the other side, basically looking for somebody to beat up to find his nephew.  Dozens of police, instead of being out looking for the missing kid, are lined up behind riot shields to control the crowd that is growing larger and angrier.  Then there is Karen Collucci (Edie Falco), the leader of a group that looks for children who have been kidnapped, molested or killed, as well as the various people from Council's community who add several interpersonal dimensions to his handling of the case.Author Richard Price did the screenplay for this 2006 film based on his novel, so the responsibility for how this version misfires has to be laid at his word processor.  Maybe in stripping the book down to a 113-minute film the flaws are revealed because of the streamlining of plot elements and characters.  Certainly our expectations are raised when you have Jackson and Moore as the two main characters, but the key scene ends up being between Moore and Falco.  Ultimately the big question for the film version of ""Freedomland"" is whether Price intended for us to ""know"" what is happening early on in the game or if it is just an unfortunate mistake.  If the former, then everything Council does is put in a different light and he assumes a greater responsibility for everything that goes wrong.  However, if the latter, then his competency is questioned because he really should know better and given the evidence has no excuse for his errors other than the fact Price wrote the story that way.  Either way, this film just does not work the way it should.",3,"A fatal flaw dooms ""Freedomland"" pretty much right from the start",1149811200,"06 9, 2006",2006,3579,"['Creating', 'maintaining', 'sense', 'ambiguity', 'motion', 'picture', 'delicate', 'proposition', 'think', 'film', 'K-Pax', 'where', 'want', 'believe', 'just', 'maybe', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'character', 'really', 'alien', 'are', 'confronted', 'evidence', 'proposition', 'then', 'film', 'Flightplan', 'where', 'trailer', 'question', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'daughter', 'ever', 'really', 'was', 'airplane', 'shot', 'window', 'end', 'row', 'Throwing', 'away', 'ambiguity', 'situation', 'audience', 'even', 'seen', 'film', 'incredibly', 'bad', 'move', 'then', 'live', 'age', 'were', 'far', 'too', 'often', 'trailers', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'have', 'best', 'moments', 'film.The', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'Freedomland', 'movie', 'away', 'ambiguity', 'then', 'character', 'should', 'know', 'better', 'act', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'just', 'happened', 'film', 'Brenda', 'Martin', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'staggering', 'hospital', 'bleeding', 'hands', 'car', 'was', 'hijacked', 'housing', 'project', 'Detective', 'Lorenzo', 'Council', 'Samual', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'assigned', 'case', 'first', 'big', 'question', 'what', 'Brenda', 'was', 'doing', 'driving', 'around', 'projects', 'Brenda', 'explanation', 'children', 'center', 'projects', 'just', 'made', 'wrong', 'term', 'way', 'home', 'Council', 'something', 'Brenda', 'not', 'saying', 'right', 'when', 'here', 'four-year-old', 'son', 'was', 'asleep', 'back', 'car', 'when', 'was', 'hijacked', 'declaration', 'everything.The', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'Freedomland', 'not', 'only', 'search', 'car', 'missing', 'boy', 'also', 'tensions', 'building', 'streets', 'project', 'Community', 'leaders', 'are', 'outraged', 'once', 'again', 'police', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'doing', 'everything', 'can', 'find', 'missing', 'white', 'child', 'never', 'doing', 'half', 'much', 'when', 'black', 'child', 'disappears', 'Brenda', 'brother', 'Danny', 'Martin', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'cop', 'going', 'off', 'deep', 'end', 'other', 'side', 'basically', 'looking', 'somebody', 'beat', 'up', 'find', 'nephew', 'Dozens', 'police', 'instead', 'being', 'out', 'looking', 'missing', 'kid', 'are', 'lined', 'up', 'riot', 'shields', 'control', 'crowd', 'growing', 'larger', 'angrier', 'Then', 'Karen', 'Collucci', 'Edie', 'Falco', 'leader', 'group', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'molested', 'killed', 'as', 'well', 'various', 'people', 'Council', 'community', 'who', 'several', 'interpersonal', 'dimensions', 'handling', 'case.Author', 'Richard', 'Price', 'did', 'screenplay', '2006', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'responsibility', 'how', 'version', 'be', 'laid', 'word', 'processor', 'Maybe', 'stripping', 'book', 'down', '113-minute', 'film', 'flaws', 'are', 'revealed', 'streamlining', 'plot', 'elements', 'characters', 'Certainly', 'expectations', 'are', 'raised', 'when', 'have', 'Jackson', 'Moore', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'key', 'scene', 'up', 'being', 'Moore', 'Falco', 'Ultimately', 'big', 'question', 'film', 'version', 'Freedomland', 'Price', 'intended', 'know', 'what', 'happening', 'early', 'game', 'just', 'unfortunate', 'mistake', 'former', 'then', 'everything', 'Council', 'put', 'different', 'light', 'greater', 'responsibility', 'everything', 'wrong', 'However', 'latter', 'then', 'competency', 'questioned', 'really', 'should', 'know', 'better', 'given', 'evidence', 'excuse', 'errors', 'other', 'fact', 'Price', 'wrote', 'story', 'way', 'way', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'work', 'way', 'should']",Freedomland

988711,A2MF2QVSCUI27G,B000FEBZ0A,"Luan Gaines ""luansos""","[2, 4]","I didn't find Freedomland nearly as offensive as most people who have reviewed it, maybe because I love Richard Wright's in-your-face approach to contemporary racial issues and society's attempts to control the chaos that sometimes threatens to overwhelm our modern cities, in this case, when the public demands an immediate response to a heinous crime against a white child. Brenda Martin (Julianne Moore), a white woman, is carjacked in a black neighborhood, and as the plot evolves, she admits to Lorenzo Cousins (Samuel L Jackson), a detective who has seen better days, that her four-year-old son was asleep in the back of the car. What first appears an elementary investigation takes on the air of tragedy as an intensive search for the child is begun, the projects the subject of intense police scrutiny.Chaos exists on two levels in the film: first, Brenda is clearly keeping essential information to herself, causing Lorenzo to doubt her story and question her motivation; secondly, because a white child is assumed lost somewhere in the projects, the police take aggressive action that they probably would not attempt in another neighborhood. When they lock the area down, treating the residents as criminals, the result is predictable, the threat of a riot increasing exponentially. We know from the beginning the likely outcome of Brenda's story; Lorenzo states it clearly, but it is through the more subtle conflicts that the true outrage of the situation is manifested.Moore is excellent as Brenda, distraught, haunted, guilty, the cause of endless pain for the black community. Jackson is equally impressive, his frustration and confusion in counterpoint to the desperate Brenda, as well as the ambiguity of his position in the community. Edie Falco plays a powerful, understated role as a leader of the civilian search party in Freedomland, an abandoned asylum for children. It is there, in this graveyard for children's souls, that Brenda comes to terms with the realities of her damaged life.If anyone is to blame for the excesses of this movie, perhaps it is the box office demand for action on every front, to the detriment of storytelling. It is impossible to relate the complex issues that plague our cities as depicted in this film, too much misery on too many levels. Yet this is Richard Wright's territory and he knows it well, the carelessly-mended fabric of a society damaged by years of racism and the inability of local institutions to navigate a middle ground where human dignity is a right, not an illusion. Not a pretty sight, but critical to our evolution as a country.

This sets off a change of events that strains credulity at best and at worst has you scratching your head and wondering why you've spent your hard earned money on this crock.Nothing much works here and all the disparate elements: police brutality, racial profiling, child and spousal abuse instead of adding up to something important add up instead to an overheated hodge podge of a well made but silly melodrama.",2,Stinkeroo,1140134400,"02 17, 2006",2006,971,"['Freedomland', 'mess', 'basic', 'premise', 'woman', 'Brenda', 'glammed', 'down', 'scenery', 'chewing', 'think', 'horrifying', 'effective', 'scene', 'Moore', 'Magnolia', 'off', 'pharmacist', 'now', '50', 'usually', 'effective', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'car', 'snatched', 'walks', 'hospital', 'hands', 'bloodied', '15', 'minutes', 'counselor-defender', 'Lorenzo', 'Council', 'intense', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'who', 'level', 'headed', 'best', 'make', 'sense', 'part', 'movie', 'son', 'was', 'back', 'seat', 'off', 'change', 'events', 'credulity', 'best', 'worst', 'scratching', 'head', 'wondering', 'why', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'hard', 'earned', 'money', 'crock.Nothing', 'much', 'works', 'here', 'disparate', 'elements', 'police', 'brutality', 'racial', 'profiling', 'child', 'spousal', 'abuse', 'instead', 'adding', 'up', 'something', 'important', 'add', 'up', 'instead', 'overheated', 'hodge', 'podge', 'well', 'made', 'silly', 'melodrama']",Freedomland

Brenda Martin (Moore) is a recovering addict who appears to genuinely be ""in trouble"", although she does not act like someone whose son has been taken (she waits until the Detective questions her to tell someone). I immediately had images of Susan Smith and Charles Stuart, and knew what the end result would be. Because I work in law enforcement (work closely with Homicide and Prosecutors) I knew that they way they treated her and how the case was investigated were realistic in a lot of ways (the mother is the first suspect, especially if she acts out of character. I also enjoyed the underlying tension between the community and police, as it relates to race relations. Again, images of Stuart and Smith came to my mind. But what I found to be the most interesting was not the plot involving the mother but the underlying plot of Lorenzo Council (Samuel Jackson) who realizes that he might not have been the best father (his son is now incarcerated for armed robbery) and his role in the all black community where the suspected offender lives.

I found it generally entertaining, as good as most films and better than some. Julianne Moore is the real reason to see the film, she is a first rate actress and she delivers arguably her best performance in this challenging role. Without this performance it would just be a high budget Lifetime network movie exploiting many elements from the Susan Smith case (the woman who drowned her kids by driving her car into a lake).In many ways it will remind you of those student radical films from the 1969-1972 era such as ""The Strawberry Statement"". The idea is to juxtapose a human-interest story against a backdrop of student or civil rights protest. As usually happens, in ""Freedomland"" the larger story ends up seeming silly and contrived. But the more intimate story, very similar to ""Bunny Lake is Missing"" (1965),  has Moore playing off of Samual L. Jackson (a detective investigating her son's kidnapping) and Edie Falco (the leader of a victim's support group). Moore's quirky and extraordinarily complex character (Brenda) is a complete wildcard and manages to turn this thing into a pretty decent thriller. Wherever Moore goes inside herself to draw out this sort of character (think ""The Hours"") must be quite a place.""Freedomland's"" biggest problems appear to be in to the post-production assembly of the film. Red herrings abound, not by design but by the inexplicable omission of motivational elements and the introduction of story details that are made to appear significant but simply vanish without follow-up. For example, Jackson has a couple asthma attacks early in the film, but his asthma condition is never a factor in the plot or the resolution-it is simply noted and dispensed with. And Brenda has a hothead brother who is groomed throughout the film to play a significant part in the resolution, but he ultimately just fades away. Were follow-up scenes trimmed and the editor too lazy to go back and delete the now completely irrelevant earlier material?The film begins with Brenda appearing in an emergency room with a story of her car being hijacked near a low-income housing development where she works as a volunteer at a community children's center. Eventually Jackson extracts from her the additional fact that her son was in the back seat of the car when it was taken. Racial tensions mount as the police seal off the housing project.The best scene is a lengthy conversation between Brenda and Falco's character during a group search of a section of woods called ""Freedomland"". The name is intentionally ironic as it the former location of a notorious children's home.""Freedomland"" is a must see for Julianne Moore fans.

988725,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000FEBZ0A,RMurray847,"[2, 2]","This is a movie full of lofty, important ideas...in its own mind.  Because there are so many twists, it's difficult to talk about it all without spoiling things...but let's just say it FREEDOMLAND thinks it has earth-shattering things to say about race relations, missing children, mental-illness and so forth.It starts out well enough.  We meet Samual Jackson, a tough-talking but secretly sensitive cop who seems to be personally responsible for all police work done in a poor project.  He knows everyone personally in this run-down complex, and they know him and expect him to look out for them.  He's called to interview a dazed and bloodied woman who has wandered into the local hospital, apparently the victim of a carjacking.  The woman, played by Julianne Moore, is clearly in shock, and it takes awhile for her to reveal (or remember)that her 4-year-old son was asleep in the backseat when the car was taken.  Jackson mobilizes the police, and then it turns out that Moore's brother (Ron Ellard) is a cop from another district, who decides he wants to run the investigation his way, by totalling shutting off the black projects from the rest of the world, essentially putting its residents into house arrest.  Unrest begins to foment.That's enough of a setup for a tense movie right there, but it gets clumsy and confused from there.  We think we're watching a thriller...but it isn't really.  We think confrontation is coming between Ellard and Jackson, but the brother's character almost totally disappears from the movie.Instead, as Jackson becomes more suspicious of Moore's story...it becomes a rumination of sorts on the plight of missing children.  Edie Falco is introduced as the leader of a group of ""concerned parents"" who dedicate themselves to finding missing kids.I think I'd better stop there with plot details...just in case you decide to see this jumble of ideas masquerading as a meaningful movie.Jackson, Moore and Falco all have long speeches at various times in the film, all clearly conceived to be used as clips to be shown during awards shows.  The actors are then allowed to indulge themselves by chewing into the scenery along with the lines they must deliver.  All three are fine actors, but here the script betrays them.  Moore comes off the worst...her character is established as a simple woman (with a thick inner-city accent) who might be bordering on mentally challenged.  Or is she simply hysterical from the shock of what's happened to her son?  We never know for certain, but when she launches into one of her lengthy, Oscar-bait speeches...she suddenly becomes a poet of sorts, full of amazing insights into her own plight and capable of sweeping rhetoric.  Not a moment of it is believable or moving.  Falco doesn't fare much better during one scene where she sits close to Moore and tries to draw her out.  The subject she is discussing (the loss of her own child) is painful, but the speech is like nothing a real person would actually ever say.  Jackson also has some purple prose to contend with, but it is slightly more credible...although by the time the movie is nearing its end, we're pretty tired of his wisdom and sensitivity.Frankly, we're just tired of the whole thing.  It feels like a three hour movie...although it's less than 2 hours.  It feels like a movie that SHOULD have left the viewer moved and thoughtful...but I was left totally cold, and my gauge of the audience's reaction leads me to believe most of them felt the same.

988726,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000FEBZ0A,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[5, 6]","Freedomland (Joe Roth, 2006)I have spent the past few years studiously avoiding blaming Spike Lee for the confused mess that was Clockers (though his subsequent movies have caused me to think he does deserve a good portion of the blame). I always shifted it to Richard Price, who wrote the original novel. Now we get another film adaptation of another Richard Price novel, where Price once again adapted the screenplay, and instead of a guy like Spike Lee-- who may be in a bumpy patch of his career, but man, the guy can nail the hide to the wall when he's on his game-- we get Joe Roth, responsible for such deathless cinematic fare as Revenge of the Nerds II and Christmas with the Kranks? Is there any way this film was not going to be a disaster?Okay, so we cast Julianne Moore as a mother with a missing kid (hmm, there's a huge stretch) and Samuel L. Jackson as a cop (whoa, what casting bravery!). And that's pretty much your movie-- white woman gets carjacked in black area with kid in back of car, black cop doesn't quite buy it but is willing to go the extra mile anyway. Do you see the big twist coming?The problem is that the big twist takes forever to get coming. Did we really need a full hour of explication to get that there's racial tension building, and that it's liable to explode at any moment? (Short answer: no.) I'm sure that in the novel, there's a wonderful parallel between the missing kid and the racial tension. It does not exist in the film, which treats when as two entirely separate, if overlapping, storylines for most of its length. The scenes where they do coincide seem extraneous at best and profoundly uncomfortable at worst. Add in a few unnecessary subplots and some attempts at character development-- though I should probably be giving points for the fact that attempts were made at all-- that are painfully obvious plot devices, and you get an endurance test rather than a film-- and not in a good way. Most of the acting here is marginal (with each passing Julianne Moore film, I wonder what happened to the actress whose small part in Hellcab had me riveted to the seat); Sam Jackson does his thing, and William Forsythe (The Devil's Rejects) has an amusing, if small, role as his partner. A few others are on the flip side of the coin, but mother always taught me that if I didn't have anything nice to say...Ah, that's not true. I love excoriating people who turn in substandard (especially for them) performances. But why waste any more energy on a movie so aggressively mediocre? When a Sam Jackson movie has me squirming in my seat and wishing the DVD remote worked so I could fast-forward it and watch with subtitles, it's a hopeless case. So hopeless I can't even bring myself to give it the trashing it truly deserves. I'll leave you to do that yourself. *",1,"Oh, the pain.",1155513600,"08 14, 2006",2006,2809,"['Freedomland', 'Joe', 'Roth', '2006', 'have', 'spent', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'studiously', 'avoiding', 'blaming', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'confused', 'mess', 'was', 'Clockers', 'subsequent', 'movies', 'have', 'caused', 'think', 'deserve', 'good', 'portion', 'blame', 'always', 'shifted', 'Richard', 'Price', 'who', 'wrote', 'original', 'novel', 'Now', 'get', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Richard', 'Price', 'novel', 'where', 'Price', 'once', 'again', 'adapted', 'screenplay', 'instead', 'guy', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'bumpy', 'patch', 'career', 'man', 'guy', 'can', 'nail', 'hide', 'wall', 'when', 'game', 'get', 'Joe', 'Roth', 'responsible', 'such', 'deathless', 'cinematic', 'fare', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', 'II', 'Christmas', 'Kranks', 'there', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'disaster', 'Okay', 'cast', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'mother', 'missing', 'kid', 'hmm', 'huge', 'stretch', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'cop', 'whoa', 'what', 'casting', 'bravery', 'pretty', 'much', 'movie', 'white', 'woman', 'carjacked', 'black', 'area', 'kid', 'back', 'car', 'black', 'cop', ""n't"", 'quite', 'buy', 'willing', 'go', 'extra', 'mile', 'anyway', 'Do', 'see', 'big', 'twist', 'coming', 'problem', 'big', 'twist', 'forever', 'get', 'coming', 'Did', 'really', 'need', 'full', 'hour', 'explication', 'get', 'racial', 'tension', 'building', 'liable', 'explode', 'moment', 'Short', 'answer', ""'m"", 'sure', 'novel', 'wonderful', 'parallel', 'missing', 'kid', 'racial', 'tension', 'not', 'exist', 'film', 'when', 'two', 'entirely', 'separate', 'overlapping', 'storylines', 'most', 'length', 'scenes', 'where', 'do', 'coincide', 'seem', 'extraneous', 'best', 'profoundly', 'uncomfortable', 'worst', 'Add', 'few', 'unnecessary', 'subplots', 'attempts', 'character', 'development', 'should', 'probably', 'be', 'giving', 'points', 'fact', 'attempts', 'were', 'made', 'are', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'plot', 'devices', 'get', 'endurance', 'test', 'rather', 'film', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'Most', 'acting', 'here', 'marginal', 'passing', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'film', 'wonder', 'what', 'happened', 'actress', 'small', 'part', 'Hellcab', 'had', 'riveted', 'seat', 'Sam', 'Jackson', 'thing', 'William', 'Forsythe', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'amusing', 'small', 'role', 'partner', 'few', 'others', 'are', 'flip', 'side', 'coin', 'always', 'taught', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'nice', 'say', 'Ah', 'not', 'true', 'love', 'excoriating', 'people', 'who', 'turn', 'substandard', 'especially', 'performances', 'why', 'waste', 'more', 'energy', 'movie', 'so', 'aggressively', 'mediocre', 'When', 'Sam', 'Jackson', 'movie', 'squirming', 'seat', 'wishing', 'DVD', 'remote', 'worked', 'so', 'could', 'fast-forward', 'watch', 'subtitles', 'hopeless', 'case', 'hopeless', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'bring', 'give', 'trashing', 'truly', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'do', '*']",Freedomland

Jackson and Juliane Moore give great performances, the plot line of this movie is too muddled to save these two great actors. The movie doesn't work as a police drama if you know anything about professional policing. And the people in the movie don't seem true to type. Julianne Moore is the ""saint of the projects"" except for the fact that she's abusing her kid, boinking her best friend's husband, lying to the police, and covering up for a manslaughter charge. She supposedly is racially unbiased, but as soon as she needs a fall guy, she creates the ""mysterious black guy"" and is quite happy to let a neighborhood burn down to cover her tracks. She should have been put in a mental ward under protective custody in the first scene.Too many characters spend their time yelling at each other rather than getting their jobs done. Samuel L. Jackson is the good cop but everybody in the movie dumps on him, criticizes how he does his job, or prevents him from doing it. He seems to break every rule in the book in dealing with Moore's character.Edie Falco is misused as the head of an organization that tracks down missing children. Doesn't anyone notice that she uses about 90% of the volunteers as decoy while she leads Moore on a separate journey with a completely different agenda?

988728,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000FEBZ0A,Samuel McKewon,"[0, 2]","It's been 14 years, more than 30 movies and four Academy Award nominations since Julianne Moore was the sexiest thing in ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle"" and she's never hacked like she does in ""Freedomland"" as a single mom named Brenda, who wanders into a hospital with stigmata wounds on her hands, the apparent victim of a carjacking. The movie's a mess anyhow but Moore's histrionic, nearly autistic performance gnaws at the high points of Richard Price's screenplay, and the strong supporting work from Samuel L Jackson and Edie Falco.Based on Price's novel, Jackson stars as Lorenzo ""Big Daddy"" Council, lead homicide detective in Price's fictional Dempsy, N.J., a burned-out mini-ghetto next door to the whiter, middle-class Gannon. Lorenzo falls into an asthmatic fit when Brenda describes a black man who must have come from a local project house to rob her car and drive off with her son. Complicating matters: Her brother Danny (Ron Eldard) is a Gannon cop who threatens to ""lock down"" the project "" like East (expletive) Berlin."" Lorenzo's boss has similar ideas when he tosses renters out of their apartments for a full-building search. Outside the crowd remains, boiling to a riotous froth.Based on the Susan Smith murders - the South Carolina woman concocted a carjacking tale before she admitted, after relentless questioning, that she drowned her children - ""Freedomland"" chugs on a dual-engine: The investigation into Cody's dubious kidnapping; and the rising racial tension between the cops and the housing project. The plots have several blights - What happened to the car? What's Danny's role? How likely is Brenda's revelatory connection to one of the tenants? - but Price has a talent for street dialogue, and his script pays close attention to the vocal rhythms of the working class - black and white - its use of profanity, its razor-thin trust in anyone, and the need to self-fulfill fears of the other.Underneath all of ""Freedomland"" runs a doomsday current of a world too broken to ever reconcile all the festering guilt and pain; whatever Brenda's done, she's seems to have been ritually punished for it already.  Maybe that's why Price has Lorenzo talking plainly about his faith in two scenes. It's the last ladder out of the sewer. But he is caught in between his people and Brenda, who is certainly lying, but is not necessarily a killer. Jackson, paunchy and aging, dials down his usual barking cadence to create a thoughtful, tired man. He leans on Brenda, he presses her gently, he assigns her a personal comforter, and he eventually relies on Karen Colluci (Falco, in the Frances McDormand role), leader of Friends of Kent, a group of moms who find lost children.It's Karen who eventually reaches through Brenda's hysterical sludge in one of the few scenes Joe Roth directs with the austerity it deserves. But he generally lets Moore put pickles on the goulash, the result of which are several different personas: This one speaks with a vaguely southern accent with broken diction, while another one says "" I over-abstained, you see,"" while a third rocks and twirls about like some neurological case. Moore depicts dawning madness as a method buffet that reminds of me of Brittany Murphy's babble in ""Don't Say A Word,"" and  Anthony Hopkins' last scene in ""Titus,"" when he thought he was going to retire, and chose to announce it by miming several of his favorite actors.

Jackson, Julianne Moore, Edie Falco, Ron Eldard, William Forsythe, Aunjunue Ellis, Anthony MackieRunning Time:  113 minutesRated R for language and some violent content.After having seen last year's dreadful Christmas comedy, ""Christmas with the Kranks,"" the entertainment world didn't have any expectations for director Joe Roth's next feature film. After having seen ""Freedomland,"" the mediocre adaptation from the novel by Richard Price, Joe Roth has made an improvement in his filmmaking technique although still not mastering his full potential. ""Freedomland"" is a not necessarily a good film by any stretch of the imagination, but it certainly is an interesting movie that tackles strong issues that are relevant in today's society.  ""Freedomland"" features a brilliant and strong performance by Julianne Moore, who plays Brenda Martin, a former drug addict who has shifted lifestyles for her son. Samuel L. Jackson co-stars with Moore playing the role of tough cop Lorenzo Council, who has sadly lost his son to a violent lifestyle of crime. After having walked into a hospital with blood-drenched hands, she informs Lorenzo that her vehicle has been stolen along with her son in the back seat. Brenda, a white woman, blames the kidnapping on an African-American man who lives in the projects which prompts the police to quickly quarantine that area and as a result creates a massive racial protest. Lorenzo, an African-American male, must now try to find the whereabouts of the missing boy while facing the persecution of his race.Lorenzo receives the aid from a group of mothers who assist officials in finding missing children. This group of vigilantes headed by Karen Collucci (Edie Falco), a victim of child kidnapping, believes that the kidnapping may have come from a source, which many others suspect to be. Karen believes that the child may be in Freedomland, an area that once was a children's hospital. By this point, ""Freedomland"" is beginning to juggle its themes and this is where the film begins to break its consistency. From one hand you have a brilliant thriller about missing children and on the other hand you have a film that deals with racial tensions.  Director Joe Roth had a problem trying to figure out the direction of ""Freedomland."" The ingredients for a superior film are very vivid but not efficiently applied.

988735,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000FEBZ0A,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","A carjacking case and a missing 4-year-old boy trigger tension in a fictional town of New Jersey. ""Freedomland"" which is based on Richard Price's book and stars Samuel L. Jackson and Julianne Moore, could have been a gritty thriller with a better hand like Spike Lee (who did ""Clockers"" based on Price's book). Unfortunately, in spite of its occasionally interesting moments, ""Freedomland"" falls flat with lack of sure-handed direction.Julianne Moore plays Brenda whose four-year-old son is missing. Police detective Lorenzo played by Samuel L. Jackson thinks something is wrong with her testimony as to how her boy was kidnapped, but finding the missing child is not easy as the injured mother suffers severely from the shock and her traumatic past. The film also involves several scenes of racially-triggered violence.Every part of the film is decently made. They are shot with authentic locations, good supports (from Edie Falco, Ron Eldard and William Forsyth) and intense acting from Moore. She is so intense at times that some may think she is overdoing it, but anyway she is credible as tormented mother. Still something is not just right like Brenda's testimony.[CLUMSY STORYTELLING] So many things are going on at one time. The film at first centers around the mystery of a missing boy, and then it raises a question about the conflict among the Afro-Americans. Instead of developing these ideas, director Joe Roth introduces new topics one after another into the story. As a result the mystery of the kidnapped boy never becomes intriguing. Lorenzo's inner struggle as black detective is not explored enough. You expect surprises from the solutions of the mystery, or cathartic effect after seeing tense acting from the leads. Sorry but you cannot have either of them.""Freedomland"" includes more than one socially relevant issue. Film's ""Friends of Kent"" is based on the real group ""Friends of Jennifer for Missing Children,"" volunteer group that searches missing persons. Edie Falco's character is based on Donna Cutugno, leader of the group ""Friends of Jennifer for Missing Children,"" who also appears as Elaine in the film. Here ""Freedomland"" is given a chance to be original, but Joe Roth somehow wastes it with among the jumbled storytelling. The film has excellent ingredients to make a superb thriller, which you don't see in ""Freedomland.""",2,Parts Better Than the Whole: Could Be a Gritty Thriller with Better Storytelling,1173571200,"03 11, 2007",2007,2357,"['carjacking', 'case', 'missing', '4-year-old', 'boy', 'trigger', 'tension', 'fictional', 'town', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Freedomland', 'based', 'Richard', 'Price', 'book', 'stars', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'gritty', 'thriller', 'better', 'hand', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'who', 'did', 'Clockers', 'based', 'Price', 'book', 'Unfortunately', 'spite', 'occasionally', 'interesting', 'moments', 'Freedomland', 'flat', 'lack', 'sure-handed', 'direction.Julianne', 'Moore', 'Brenda', 'four-year-old', 'son', 'missing', 'Police', 'detective', 'Lorenzo', 'played', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'something', 'wrong', 'testimony', 'how', 'boy', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'finding', 'missing', 'child', 'not', 'easy', 'injured', 'mother', 'suffers', 'severely', 'shock', 'traumatic', 'past', 'film', 'also', 'several', 'scenes', 'racially-triggered', 'violence.Every', 'part', 'film', 'decently', 'made', 'are', 'shot', 'authentic', 'locations', 'good', 'supports', 'Edie', 'Falco', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'William', 'Forsyth', 'intense', 'acting', 'Moore', 'so', 'intense', 'times', 'may', 'think', 'overdoing', 'anyway', 'credible', 'tormented', 'mother', 'Still', 'something', 'not', 'just', 'right', 'Brenda', 'testimony', 'CLUMSY', 'STORYTELLING', ']', 'So', 'many', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'one', 'time', 'film', 'first', 'centers', 'mystery', 'missing', 'boy', 'then', 'question', 'conflict', 'Afro-Americans', 'Instead', 'developing', 'ideas', 'director', 'Joe', 'Roth', 'new', 'topics', 'one', 'story', 'result', 'mystery', 'kidnapped', 'boy', 'never', 'intriguing', 'Lorenzo', 'inner', 'struggle', 'black', 'detective', 'not', 'explored', 'enough', 'expect', 'surprises', 'solutions', 'mystery', 'cathartic', 'effect', 'seeing', 'tense', 'acting', 'leads', 'Sorry', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'Freedomland', 'more', 'one', 'socially', 'relevant', 'issue', 'Film', 'Friends', 'Kent', 'based', 'real', 'group', 'Friends', 'Jennifer', 'Missing', 'Children', 'volunteer', 'group', 'missing', 'persons', 'Edie', 'Falco', 'character', 'based', 'Donna', 'Cutugno', 'leader', 'group', 'Friends', 'Jennifer', 'Missing', 'Children', 'who', 'also', 'Elaine', 'film', 'Here', 'Freedomland', 'given', 'chance', 'be', 'original', 'Joe', 'Roth', 'somehow', 'jumbled', 'storytelling', 'film', 'excellent', 'ingredients', 'make', 'superb', 'thriller', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Freedomland']",Freedomland

This movie is another attempt to try and teach bigots how bad African-Americans have it in the projects.  While that is true for the innocent of the people living there trying to live their lives over there, the attempts here end up making the movie too preachy.  There's one scene where Jackson's character, Det. Council, wants to ignore his present case, Julianne's missing child case,  even though there are police on the scene, to handle a  jumper who is about to jump out of a hi-rise window.  The residents are upset in the movie, but, in real life?  They would all be screaming ""Jump! Jump!"" and that's the truth because I've lived most of my life in the projects.  And the people you see antagonizing the cops in this movie, you really end up hating.  People have complained that the movie is disjointed.  I agree.  It goes from actually being a movie with a plot, to turning into an excuse to spew racist slurs to whites (and blacks who are then called ""Uncle Toms"") and make whites, again, nothing but racists and liars.The movie is a festival of unlikable behavior on all sides.  So, the lesson this movie is trying to teach the moviegoer becomes heavy-handed and hypocritical.Julianne Moore is good as the pathetic lonely woman (who seems to constantly physically beat herself up and is, obviously, mentally unbalanced) and Samuel L. Jackson is, for the most part, very good as the caring detective who, although he is resentful because of sometimes perceived, other times factual indifference of police, he does his job dutifully.
