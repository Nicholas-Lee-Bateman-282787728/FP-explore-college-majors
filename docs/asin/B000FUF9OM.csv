996155,A1P5D6RTT42XO8,B000FUF9OM,Amazon Customer,"[7, 7]","The movie starts out by quoting the book of Enoch that references the story of angels that came down and slept with human females and then were tossed out of heaven.  This led me to believe that the angels in the woods were actually the Nephilim, the deformed by-product of an angel and a human female's union, but the movie never made it clear.  The movie does refer to the naked women in the woods as angels, which doesn't make much sense to me going by the reference at the beginning.  However, that aside, the movie does have some good ideas and does produce a fair amount of tension.  The relationship between the brother and the arrogant sister was very interesting to me.  This movie tries to be a true horror film, meaning that it doesn't try to incorporate humor in it at all.  There are some moments that don't work for me, but overall, I'm glad I picked it up.  It was great to see Tom Savini, who I think overacted some, but not to any degree that detracted from the movie for me.

McClellan ""marksakissfan""","[13, 13]","Demonic may look very much like a lot of the bargain basement horror stuff littering video shelves, but that's because it is. And for much of the first half of this flick there's no difference between this and every other piece of schlock. The movie starts out (as they all do) with 5 teens who are crossing the deep woods in the crappiest vehicle they can find. Naturally it breaks down and our clueless lot split up and begin to search for help. Much of their time (and ours) is spent wandering aimlessly shouting ""Hello!"" and ""Who's there?"" a lot. Then a couple of them stumble upon an abandoned house yet go inside anyway to find a phone. Now mind you they find one but despite the fact that it obviously doesn't work they try to use it anyway! But they are attacked and knocked out by the lone occupant (Tom Savini).At about this point the movie does something unexpected. It starts getting good. It turns out that Savini's character is held prisoner inside the place by six demonic, beautiful, and very naked babes! Apparently they love to make out with their victims before they devour them (men and women alike). When they begin attacking the seperated group, they (quite literally) turn them into lower lip sandwiches! When the main couple free themselves of Savini's grasp they have to contend with the demons in their escape attempt. These scenes are the best in the movie for they actually have some semblance of suspense. The makeup design for these creatures is pretty good and so is a scene where a guy gets disemboweled. And of course it certainly helps that our deadly lasses don't wear a stitch throughout the entire thing.

996162,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000FUF9OM,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Forest of the Damned (Johannes Roberts, 2005)I'll start off by saying what I would normally leave till the end, because I don't want to waste your time (or any more of mine than I already have): unless you're a Tom Savini fanatic who absolutely must see everything in which the man appears, avoid this clich&eacute;-ridden, derivative tripe like the plague. On the other hand, if you're a Savini completist, the kind of person who only saw Zack and Miri Make a Porno because Tom Savini had a small part in it, then by all means, give this one a go.While I hesitate to call anything in this movie a ""plot"", I will attempt a synopsis: there's a forest that contains the damned. The damned in this case seem to be some sort of offspring of sirens, who wander around wearing no clothes, getting it on with one another when there don't happen to be any males around, and slaying passersby for food. Needless to say, with a setup like this, you know there has to be a group of young-and-beautifuls whose van is going to break down smack in the middle of said forest. And right you are! They stumble upon a house in the middle of the forest and try to take shelter there, but they soon find out that while what's in the house is more human, it's no less deadly...Yeah, that's pretty much it. And plots like this can be done with wit, style, and aplomb on occasion. Forest of the Damned is not one of those times. Roberts is also responsible for Hellbreeder and Darkhunters. About those, perhaps it's best to say that at 3.1, Forest of the Damned has the highest rating of any of Roberts' feature films listed at IMDB. Probably because it contains Savini, as well as supermodel Nicole Petty (who should stick to modeling), so there's at least some to cheer for and someone to stare at. Other than that, though, there's not a single thing about this dog to recommend; stay far, far away. *",1,Forest of the... ummmm... hot naked chicks with sharp teeth.
