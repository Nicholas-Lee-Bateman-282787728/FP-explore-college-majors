1663908,A17DE61L1M0IG1,B00E3UN44W,Alex418,"[1, 2]","The conclusion to season two, titled &#34;The Reichenbach Fall&#34; is an amazing episode of television and one of my favorites ever, so naturally my excitement for where this show would go from there was very exciting. Unfortunately, I feel that season three ultimately fell short of its promise. Note that this review is going to have some SPOILERS.Episodes one, two, and three of this season were all very different in my opinion, but they all had some issues. The first episode primarily focuses on Sherlock's return and how everyone reacts as a result. We get to watch some fun theories play out on screen as a result, but I did have a major problem with the answer we finally got (unless Sherlock was just messing with Anderson, which I'm assuming is not actually true). Part of what made the season two finale so great was that Moriarty had managed to ruin Sherlock's image, so revealing that all of the events that occured in this entire episode were all part of a large group of people's plans was disappointing to find out. Other issues with this episode including a rushed terrorist plotline and some visually stylistic sequences that simply became annoying, although thankfully this issue evaporated in the latter two episodes.The second episode, while doing a good job at developing Sherlock's character, felt like it had A LOT of filler moments and the overall mystery with the belts was not very interesting. I thought it was the weakest the show has had so far because they seemed to have to really stretch the material to get it to 90 minutes. . Finally, the third episode, though the best of the bunch, had two different disappointing resolutions. The major villain storing all of the information in his mind was a weak reveal, and the fact that Moriarty is still alive is just ridiculous. At this point, &#34;The Reichenbach&#34; Fall is basically irrelevant, which is a major disappointment.Despite all of these problems I had this season, there are still some very great things about Sherlock. The show's sense of humor is still fantastic, and Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman carry this show on their backs and make it enjoyable even when the plot is weak. I personally did not enjoy the character Mary but I understand her purpose. Ultimately, I was more let down with this season because we get so little of this show in such a great amount of time that I feel like we should have accomplished more along the way. If season four does happen, I will continue watching, but this season was a disappointment overall.",3,"Not Awful, But a Step Down from Seasons 1 and 2",1400544000,"05 20, 2014",2014,2544,"['conclusion', 'season', 'two', 'titled', '34', 'Reichenbach', 'Fall', '34', 'amazing', 'episode', 'television', 'one', 'favorites', 'ever', 'so', 'naturally', 'excitement', 'where', 'show', 'would', 'go', 'there', 'was', 'very', 'exciting', 'Unfortunately', 'feel', 'season', 'three', 'ultimately', 'fell', 'short', 'promise', 'Note', 'review', 'going', 'have', 'SPOILERS.Episodes', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'season', 'were', 'very', 'different', 'opinion', 'had', 'issues', 'first', 'episode', 'primarily', 'Sherlock', 'return', 'how', 'everyone', 'result', 'get', 'watch', 'fun', 'theories', 'play', 'out', 'screen', 'result', 'did', 'have', 'major', 'problem', 'answer', 'finally', 'got', 'Sherlock', 'was', 'just', 'messing', 'Anderson', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'not', 'actually', 'true', 'Part', 'what', 'made', 'season', 'two', 'finale', 'so', 'great', 'was', 'Moriarty', 'had', 'managed', 'ruin', 'Sherlock', 'image', 'so', 'revealing', 'events', 'occured', 'entire', 'episode', 'were', 'part', 'large', 'group', 'people', 'plans', 'was', 'disappointing', 'find', 'out', 'Other', 'issues', 'episode', 'including', 'rushed', 'terrorist', 'plotline', 'visually', 'stylistic', 'sequences', 'simply', 'became', 'annoying', 'thankfully', 'issue', 'evaporated', 'latter', 'two', 'episodes.The', 'second', 'episode', 'doing', 'good', 'job', 'developing', 'Sherlock', 'character', 'felt', 'had', 'A', 'LOT', 'filler', 'moments', 'overall', 'mystery', 'belts', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'thought', 'was', 'weakest', 'show', 'had', 'so', 'far', 'seemed', 'have', 'really', 'stretch', 'material', 'get', '90', 'minutes', 'Finally', 'third', 'episode', 'best', 'bunch', 'had', 'two', 'different', 'disappointing', 'resolutions', 'major', 'villain', 'storing', 'information', 'mind', 'was', 'weak', 'reveal', 'fact', 'Moriarty', 'still', 'alive', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'point', '34', 'Reichenbach', '34', 'Fall', 'basically', 'irrelevant', 'major', 'disappointment.Despite', 'problems', 'had', 'season', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'great', 'things', 'Sherlock', 'show', 'sense', 'humor', 'still', 'fantastic', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'carry', 'show', 'backs', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'when', 'plot', 'weak', 'personally', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'character', 'Mary', 'understand', 'purpose', 'Ultimately', 'was', 'more', 'let', 'down', 'season', 'get', 'so', 'little', 'show', 'such', 'great', 'amount', 'time', 'feel', 'should', 'have', 'accomplished', 'more', 'way', 'season', 'four', 'happen', 'will', 'continue', 'watching', 'season', 'was', 'disappointment', 'overall']",N/A

1663910,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B00E3UN44W,Allan M. Lees,"[67, 87]","The first two seasons of Sherlock were quite brilliant. Sadly, after a two year wait, fans will mostly be disappointed by this new series. Steve Moffat, the showrunner both for Sherlock and for Doctor Who, has gone far beyond the limits of his ability both as a writer and as a series &#34;mastermind.&#34;  While there are occasional aspects of cleverness in each of the three episodes of Series 3, and some glimpses of what might have been, the general effect is so off-key as to be jarring.Moffat has a few tropes that undermine what might otherwise have been achieved. His first trope is a total inability to write serious parts for women. His second trope is his inability to deal with emotions in anything other than a here's-a-quick-laugh manner. His final trope is to use death as merely a momentary plot device. Doctor Who became famous for characters who died, then were resurrected, then killed again, then resurrected again.... it was awful in a children's show and it's utterly ruinous in adult entertainment. In the end the audience switches off, bored and irritated. Moffat can't help doing it in Sherlock. Thus, instead of real pathos and loss we get - a stupid &#34;plot twist&#34; which is boring once and excessively tedious thereafter. But Moffat can't help it. It's how he writes. And Sherlock is the worse for it. Each of the &#34;unexpected twists&#34; were so obvious - once you know Moffat's reflexive writing style - that on first watching I wondered whether subliminal &#34;here it comes!!&#34; messages were being flashed in between frames. Nothing was surprising although much was preposterous. For example, do ex-CIA hit-people really go into hiding as .... receptionist nurses in a small London doctor's practice? Really? And not be bored out of their minds within 15 seconds? Would a man seriously on the Asperger's spectrum be able to pretend convincingly that he was in a relationship with a full-blooded woman (just to gain access to an office he could have gained access to more easily by swiping the woman's entry card directly....)? There's better fan fiction available for free on the Internet than the stuff Moffat & Co are churning out here.On the plus side the actors are uniformly excellent, despite the clunky scripts and absurd situations. They manage to make poor dialog and inconsistent characterization fade slightly into the background because of superlative performances. If only they had better material to work with! Even the camera work, which in the first two series was as much a &#34;character&#34; as the actors we watch, is less interesting and more humdrum in Series 3.All in all it's difficult to recommend paying the purchase price for what is a rather vapid effort. The gap between what could have been and what actually was produced is so vast as to engender nothing but lasting disappointment.There's far too much schoolboy humor and far too little of the reason-based cleverness that made the first two series so appealing. If you're going to write a show based around a character who makes logical deductions, you can't write scripts that have gaping plot holes and which rely on &#34;here's another joke, please don't notice the gaps&#34; tricks and evasions. Sherlock's character is utterly unconvincing now, despite the very best efforts of Cumberpatch. In short, this series reflects the fact that Sherlock became far more popular than the writers expected and now they are milking it for all it's worth, without making any real effort to write scripts worthy of viewing.",2,Moffat & Co Disappoint Severely,1389744000,"01 15, 2014",2014,3541,"['first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Sherlock', 'were', 'quite', 'brilliant', 'Sadly', 'two', 'year', 'wait', 'fans', 'will', 'mostly', 'be', 'disappointed', 'new', 'series', 'Steve', 'Moffat', 'showrunner', 'Sherlock', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'gone', 'far', 'limits', 'ability', 'writer', 'series', '34', 'mastermind.', '34', 'are', 'occasional', 'aspects', 'cleverness', 'three', 'episodes', 'Series', '3', 'glimpses', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'general', 'effect', 'so', 'off-key', 'be', 'jarring.Moffat', 'few', 'tropes', 'undermine', 'what', 'might', 'otherwise', 'have', 'been', 'achieved', 'first', 'trope', 'total', 'inability', 'write', 'serious', 'parts', 'women', 'second', 'trope', 'inability', 'deal', 'emotions', 'anything', 'other', ""here's-a-quick-laugh"", 'manner', 'final', 'trope', 'use', 'death', 'merely', 'momentary', 'plot', 'device', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'became', 'famous', 'characters', 'who', 'died', 'then', 'were', 'resurrected', 'then', 'killed', 'again', 'then', 'resurrected', 'again', 'was', 'awful', 'children', 'show', 'utterly', 'ruinous', 'adult', 'entertainment', 'end', 'audience', 'bored', 'irritated', 'Moffat', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'doing', 'Sherlock', 'Thus', 'instead', 'real', 'pathos', 'loss', 'get', 'stupid', '34', 'plot', 'twist', '34', 'boring', 'once', 'excessively', 'tedious', 'thereafter', 'Moffat', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'how', 'Sherlock', 'worse', '34', 'unexpected', 'twists', '34', 'were', 'so', 'obvious', 'once', 'know', 'Moffat', 'reflexive', 'writing', 'style', 'first', 'watching', 'wondered', 'subliminal', '34', 'here', '34', 'messages', 'were', 'being', 'flashed', 'frames', 'Nothing', 'was', 'surprising', 'much', 'was', 'preposterous', 'example', 'do', 'ex-CIA', 'hit-people', 'really', 'go', 'hiding', 'receptionist', 'nurses', 'small', 'London', 'doctor', 'practice', 'Really', 'not', 'be', 'bored', 'minds', '15', 'seconds', 'Would', 'man', 'seriously', 'Asperger', 'spectrum', 'be', 'able', 'pretend', 'convincingly', 'was', 'relationship', 'full-blooded', 'woman', 'just', 'gain', 'access', 'office', 'could', 'have', 'gained', 'access', 'more', 'easily', 'swiping', 'woman', 'entry', 'card', 'directly', 'better', 'fan', 'fiction', 'available', 'free', 'Internet', 'stuff', 'Moffat', 'Co', 'are', 'churning', 'out', 'plus', 'side', 'actors', 'are', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'clunky', 'scripts', 'absurd', 'situations', 'manage', 'make', 'poor', 'dialog', 'inconsistent', 'characterization', 'fade', 'slightly', 'background', 'superlative', 'performances', 'only', 'had', 'better', 'material', 'work', 'Even', 'camera', 'work', 'first', 'two', 'series', 'was', 'much', '34', 'character', '34', 'actors', 'watch', 'less', 'interesting', 'more', 'humdrum', 'Series', '3.All', 'difficult', 'recommend', 'paying', 'purchase', 'price', 'what', 'rather', 'vapid', 'effort', 'gap', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'what', 'actually', 'was', 'produced', 'so', 'vast', 'engender', 'nothing', 'lasting', 'disappointment.There', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'schoolboy', 'humor', 'far', 'too', 'little', 'reason-based', 'cleverness', 'made', 'first', 'two', 'series', 'so', 'appealing', ""'re"", 'going', 'write', 'show', 'based', 'character', 'who', 'logical', 'deductions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'write', 'scripts', 'have', 'gaping', 'plot', 'holes', 'rely', '34', 'here', 'joke', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'gaps', '34', 'tricks', 'evasions', 'Sherlock', 'character', 'utterly', 'unconvincing', 'now', 'very', 'best', 'efforts', 'Cumberpatch', 'short', 'series', 'fact', 'Sherlock', 'became', 'far', 'more', 'popular', 'writers', 'expected', 'now', 'are', 'milking', 'worth', 'making', 'real', 'effort', 'write', 'scripts', 'worthy', 'viewing']",N/A

1663930,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B00E3UN44W,Anthony L.,"[3, 6]","THE EMPTY HEARSE: Kicking off SHERLOCK's third season is The Empty Hearse; part stage setting, part howdunit, and part good ol'fashioned Sherlock business. When we meet up with our heroes, Sherlock Holmes is deep undercover in Eastern Europe, taking down the web of supercriminal Jim Moriarty. John Watson meanwhile, has grown a depression-stache and gotten himself a girlfriend: Mary Morstan, played with charm and lovable humor by Amanda Abbington. The best thing about The Empty Hearse is that it is probably the most character-centric episode of SHERLOCK yet. Steven Moffat's action-packed, witty script gives SHERLOCK's supporting characters time to shine. Look for a moving moment between Sherlock and Molly Hooper - a relationship that has always been extremely compelling, and a searing meet-up between Holmes and his ex-rival and fanboy, Anderson. And of course, Martin Freeman is nothing short of brilliant, proving once more he can make us laugh and break our hearts. There are a few hitches, though. The plot takes a bit too long to get going, and a bit inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. But on the whole, The Empty Hearse is the Sherlock-formula firing on all cylinders: it's packed with action, hilarious, heart-warming, brilliantly acted, stylish...and you finally get to see how Holmes did it! 8/10THE SIGN OF THREE: In between the drama and action of HEARSE, and the absolute mayhem of VOW, The Sign of Three is a lovely little episode filled with vibrant color, a fast-paced, fun narrative, and tons of humor. Where the first episode gave Freeman the space to sharpen his chops, THREE is Cumberbatch's time to shine. Sherlock has never been more honest or frank about his strange life, than here. And over a rambling, sprawling narrative, we hear of Holmes and Watson's strangest, most inexplicable cases, and see the human side of the irascible, high-functioning sociopath called Sherlock Holmes. Featuring some fine performances, loads of witty banter, and heapings of that style that sets SHERLOCK apart from the rest of the crowd, THREE is the deep breath before the plunge. If it has a fault, it would be that seeing Sherlock show his human side and make jokes may have seemed a little twee...until that is, we come to the final shot. I will not spoil it for you, but it is perhaps the most haunting, quietly brilliant shot in the entire series. Now THAT is Sherlock Holmes. 9/10HIS LAST VOW: When the world asked Steven Moffat how he could top the unpredictable, over-the-top insanity of Moriarty...he created Charles Augustus Magnussen. His Last Vow is by far the finest episode in Season 3, and a strong contender for best episode of the entire series. From right out of the gate, His Last Vow tells us it's going to be a new type of story...by introducing us to our villain. Charles Augustus Magnussen, played with icy, loathsome aplomb by Lars Mikkelsen...steals, no - licks and pisses on (literally) - every scene he is in. He is absolutely, deliciously despicable, and if there was a worthier opponent for Sherlock Holmes, he has yet to be found. To describe His Last Vow is to rattle off a string of superlatives. Moffat and Gatiss's writing is on tip-top form, while Benedict Cumberbatch, Martin Freeman, and Gatiss have never been better. The action is the best yet, the highlight being a jaw-dropping sequence where Sherlock must retreat into the deepest recesses of his mind to stay alive. This electrifying sequence had me numb with shock by the end...and we're only half way through. The humor, wit, and requisite Doyle references are all there, as well as some pithy commentary and family drama. And if this wasn't enough, they have to pull the rug out from under us one last time...with a memorable after-credits scene. THIS is the best of the bunch. 10/10",5,Sherlock: Episode by Episode Review,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,3808,"['EMPTY', 'HEARSE', 'Kicking', 'off', 'SHERLOCK', 'third', 'season', 'Empty', 'Hearse', 'part', 'stage', 'setting', 'part', 'howdunit', 'part', 'good', ""ol'fashioned"", 'Sherlock', 'business', 'When', 'meet', 'up', 'heroes', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'deep', 'undercover', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'taking', 'down', 'web', 'supercriminal', 'Jim', 'Moriarty', 'John', 'Watson', 'meanwhile', 'grown', 'depression-stache', 'gotten', 'girlfriend', 'Mary', 'Morstan', 'played', 'charm', 'lovable', 'humor', 'Amanda', 'Abbington', 'best', 'thing', 'Empty', 'Hearse', 'probably', 'most', 'character-centric', 'episode', 'SHERLOCK', 'yet', 'Steven', 'Moffat', 'action-packed', 'witty', 'script', 'SHERLOCK', 'supporting', 'characters', 'time', 'shine', 'Look', 'moving', 'moment', 'Sherlock', 'Molly', 'Hooper', 'relationship', 'always', 'been', 'extremely', 'compelling', 'searing', 'meet-up', 'Holmes', 'ex-rival', 'fanboy', 'Anderson', 'course', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'proving', 'once', 'more', 'can', 'make', 'laugh', 'break', 'hearts', 'are', 'few', 'hitches', 'though', 'plot', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'get', 'going', 'bit', 'inconsequential', 'grand', 'scheme', 'things', 'whole', 'Empty', 'Hearse', 'Sherlock-formula', 'firing', 'cylinders', 'packed', 'action', 'hilarious', 'heart-warming', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'stylish', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'Holmes', 'did', '8/10THE', 'SIGN', 'OF', 'THREE', 'drama', 'action', 'HEARSE', 'absolute', 'mayhem', 'VOW', 'Sign', 'Three', 'lovely', 'little', 'episode', 'filled', 'vibrant', 'color', 'fast-paced', 'fun', 'narrative', 'tons', 'humor', 'Where', 'first', 'episode', 'gave', 'Freeman', 'space', 'sharpen', 'chops', 'THREE', 'Cumberbatch', 'time', 'shine', 'Sherlock', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'honest', 'frank', 'strange', 'life', 'here', 'rambling', 'sprawling', 'narrative', 'hear', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'strangest', 'most', 'inexplicable', 'cases', 'see', 'human', 'side', 'irascible', 'high-functioning', 'sociopath', 'called', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Featuring', 'fine', 'performances', 'loads', 'witty', 'banter', 'heapings', 'style', 'SHERLOCK', 'apart', 'rest', 'crowd', 'THREE', 'deep', 'breath', 'plunge', 'fault', 'would', 'be', 'seeing', 'Sherlock', 'show', 'human', 'side', 'make', 'jokes', 'may', 'have', 'seemed', 'little', 'twee', 'come', 'final', 'shot', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'perhaps', 'most', 'haunting', 'quietly', 'brilliant', 'shot', 'entire', 'series', 'Now', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', '9/10HIS', 'LAST', 'VOW', 'When', 'world', 'asked', 'Steven', 'Moffat', 'how', 'could', 'top', 'unpredictable', 'over-the-top', 'insanity', 'Moriarty', 'created', 'Charles', 'Augustus', 'Magnussen', 'Last', 'Vow', 'far', 'finest', 'episode', 'Season', '3', 'strong', 'contender', 'best', 'episode', 'entire', 'series', 'right', 'gate', 'Last', 'Vow', 'going', 'be', 'new', 'type', 'story', 'introducing', 'villain', 'Charles', 'Augustus', 'Magnussen', 'played', 'icy', 'loathsome', 'aplomb', 'Lars', 'Mikkelsen', 'steals', 'licks', 'pisses', 'literally', 'scene', 'absolutely', 'deliciously', 'despicable', 'was', 'worthier', 'opponent', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'yet', 'be', 'found', 'describe', 'Last', 'Vow', 'rattle', 'off', 'string', 'superlatives', 'Moffat', 'Gatiss', 'writing', 'tip-top', 'form', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'Gatiss', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'action', 'best', 'yet', 'highlight', 'being', 'jaw-dropping', 'sequence', 'where', 'Sherlock', 'must', 'retreat', 'deepest', 'recesses', 'mind', 'stay', 'alive', 'electrifying', 'sequence', 'had', 'numb', 'shock', 'end', ""'re"", 'only', 'half', 'way', 'humor', 'wit', 'requisite', 'Doyle', 'references', 'are', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'pithy', 'commentary', 'family', 'drama', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'have', 'pull', 'rug', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'memorable', 'after-credits', 'scene', 'THIS', 'best', 'bunch', '10/10']",N/A

But I cannot give the new season of &#34;Sherlock&#34; the hightest of marks, much as I had hoped.The three new episodes are simply (relatively) vacuous. No main plot--no REAL mystery to solve. What has happened--I am afraid--is that Cumberbatch and Freeman (Sherlock and Watson) now have become SUCH popular stars that the writers have forsaken what got them there in the first place and so now are simply Hollywoodizing the two actors (to which neither seems to mind!), like Lady Gaga or Paris Hilton or Kate Middleton.  The first episode was &#34;trying&#34; to explain, with lots of smoke and mirrors, how Sherlock survived the Reichenball &#34;fall&#34;!  Big time sigh. Too easy.  And too much time &#34;explaining it,&#34; although, of course, no &#34;real&#34; explanation is given. And then we see just how clever Sherlock continues to be--and it's clever for clever's sake. No real plot here.  But I excused it, saying that the audience needed an explanation (but not for 1.5 hours, of course).  Then episode 2--another big sigh. Would that wedding reception NEVER end? Pul-eeze. More smoke and mirrors and no real mystery to solve, just bits and pieces either to tantalize the viewers or the scriptwriters simply had nothing better.  Episode three picks up a bit--and of course I am eager to see what the next season brings.  I love series.

1663970,AAB0BPNWDIOXJ,B00E3UN44W,Camazotz,"[5, 8]","I have to open with a caveat: I am not a Sherlock Holmes purist. I don't know Doyle's stories by heart. In fact, my recall of them is something of a watercolor, in broad strokes, at best. I have a rough idea of the sort of person Sherlock Holmes should be in adaptations of the stories, and a rough idea of the sort of person that John Watson should be. That being said, I've been quite the fan of the first two seasons of Sherlock which, in a watercolory-broad-strokey sort of way, has struck me as accurate to the hearts of the original characters, but updated for modern sensibilities. All in all, an entertaining show with a good energy about it, which is rare for a crime series.However, season three is, comparatively, a mess. I principally blame the writers, the editors, and Benedict Cumberbatch becoming a minor, overnight phenomenon for the downturn in quality.First of all, the gripes leveled by some reviewers about how Sherlock: Season Three is now a show featuring a world-class detective in need of a case are, for all intents and purposes, true. The bulk of this outing deals with Holmes coming back from the dead and handling the repercussions of such a feat. Badly. That sounds as though it could be fairly tantalizing as a story, but don't be fooled. It plays like the world's most disjointed therapy session with one of England's premier narcissists mistaking anyone who loves him for furniture in a shrink's office that exists only in his ""...mind palace..."". And that's if they're lucky. Sherlock a sociopath? Yep, could be. A high-functioning sociopath? At this point, certainly not. As for the rest of the season's writing, I won't even bother going into the laundry list of problems that I have with virtually every female character presented during this run. I'd be cranking out my review for the better part of a week. It'll suffice to say that they all come off as absurd, at best, and serve no function other than to break up what was a classic duo, keeping Sherlock and Watson working at a respectable distance from one another through a good two-thirds of the season.Then there's the editing. Dear God, the horrible editing. The first two seasons of Sherlock were just energetic enough to keep you watching, but placid enough to allow you to follow along without much trouble (barring the occasional mondo-daft plot-hole). This time, the show's footage feels as though it were ripped apart by manic toddlers all hopped up on Skittles and Mountain Dew and then pasted back together by the same. Sherlock's deductions used to be rapid fire; now they're shot at the viewer from a fire hose. A senseless torrent that's impossible to decipher.Oh, and let me not forget poor Cumberbatch (Sherlock Holmes). For some reason I like the guy. He seems to be a rather talented actor...handsome in a kind of doofy, accessible way. And he's charismatic. Alas, those are the basic components of star power, far as I can tell, and I think that the creators of Sherlock are quite aware that they have a celebrity on the edge of full-bloom in their midst. As a result, this season of Sherlock feels as though it is overrun with slow-motion, worshipfully-lit shots of Cumberbatch doing everything in his power to out-Magnum Derek Zoolander. If some peon were forced to put the occasional flicker of lens-flare on his teeth in post-production when Cumberbatch is dishing out one of his many ""...I know more than you do..."" s***-eating grins, I shouldn't be remotely surprised.However, for all of my gripes, I'm not a total hater. There were elements of Sherlock: Season Three that I quite enjoyed and I have not completely given up hope on the series. For instance, the production values (editing aside) are lovely. I truly don't understand the complaints being leveled against this season for being physically uglier than the others, with bad camera work and lousy sets, et cetera. I found all to be uniformly exquisite. Well, the wallpaper in this series is atrocious, but it always has been. That doesn't count. Otherwise, absolutely stunning to look at.Martin Freeman (John Watson) turns in a performance that is really amazing. In lesser hands, his role could have become hopelessly farcical, but Freeman, beyond question, brought forth some magic that is on par with the best actors in the best televised dramas I have ever seen. He deserves every ounce of praise he gets and several awards on top of that. Fantastic work.Lars Mikkelsen, principal baddie (such as there is one in this season) also does a stellar job in a role that--like Watson--could have easily elicited guffaws rather than applause. Instead he's a razor sharp, all-hard-angles, faintly perverse, saturnine creep that did a fine job of raising my hackles and keeping my eyes firmly on the screen when he was present. No minor feat; bravo!There were also steady doses of the humor that made me so fond of the first two seasons of Sherlock. The girl in Anderson's fan club and her theory on how Sherlock escaped death, along with the morbid kid in the second episode being notable highlights.And last, but certainly not least, the surprise ending. I know that a lot of rabid Baker Street Irregulars are irate over it, and I can understand why. However, after enduring 2.5 episodes of Sherlock wrestling with his obnoxious inner-child (and a few other lesser demons that I'd rather not have thought about), I can answer the last question asked in season three with a resounding, ""Yes sir, I have missed you. Horribly. Don't be long.""",3,"His Last Wow?

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 4]","Sherlock Holmes is dead... or so the world has thought for the past two years.But of course, he's not -- and now he must reveal that he's not dead to the world and/or Watson. &#34;Sherlock: Season Three&#34; sees  the peerless detective returning to his old life, with a lighter tone prevailing in the first two episodes -- only to take a brilliantly dark turn in the season finale. It can be a little silly, but the powerful characterizations are worth it.In &#34;The Empty Hearse,&#34; terrorists are threatening London. So Mycroft (Mark Gatiss) hunts down his presumed-to-be-dead brother Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch), and convinces him to return to his old life. Sherlock reveals himself to Watson (Martin Freeman) in a typically dramatic, slightly goofy fashion... and Watson doesn't react well. Think repeated attempts at throttling.But after a mysterious person kidnaps and almost kills Watson -- which is only thwarted by his girlfriend Mary (Amanda Abbington), Sherlock and a motorcycle -- he reluctantly joins forces with his old friend again, to stop an attack that could destroy the British government.&#34;The Sign of Three&#34;: John and Mary's wedding is here, and Sherlock is overwrought with anxiety at the idea of his best friend leaving him behind for his new life. Also, he's terrified of making a best-man speech. But while making his speech -- and recounting various odd cases he and Watson did -- he realizes that a murderer is at the wedding. And if he doesn't act fast, someone will die.&#34;His Last Vow&#34; has Watson discovering that Sherlock is trying to take down Charles Augustus Magnussen (Lars Mikkelsen), a sadistic blackmailer. But Sherlock soon discovers that Mary is somehow embroiled in Magnussen's schemes, and has a secret past that John never knew of. To take down Magnussen -- and protect the people he loves -- Sherlock may have to do the unthinkable.Sherlock Holmes deeply cares about John Watson, and will do anything to keep him and Mary safe, even though he fears losing him. Really, that is the central theme of &#34;Sherlock: Season Three&#34; -- the deep bond between these two men, and how Watson has &#34;saved&#34; Sherlock from his cold, cynical self by bringing warmth and humanity to his life.However, it's also a lot lighter than the last two seasons. The first two episodes are laden with funny moments, and &#34;The Sign of Three&#34; sometimes gets downright sitcommy (Sherlock and John go out on a pub crawl, get drunk, and Sherlock pukes on a crime scene). Admittedly this stuff is hilarious, with many clever gags (&#34;F-&#34; &#34;Cough&#34;) and wickedly funny pokes at the Sherlock fandom (the &#34;slash&#34; theory of Sherlock's survival).But the mysteries are still top-notch stuff, genuinely baffling and suspenseful. And the third episode slips into darker, more harrowing territory, where Sherlock's one and only vow is put to the test. The villain is hatable, the stakes are sky-high, and it has some truly shocking twists.But while the mysteries are magnificent, the story's success rests on the magnificent acting skills of Cumberbatch and Freeman. It becomes increasingly clear that Sherlock (no matter what he says) is not a sociopath -- he cares passionately about the people who make it into his affections, almost too much.

However I cannot quite swallow a Holmes who does what this Holmes does in the final bit of the last episode of the third season. Vigilantism, to say the least, but it goes beyond that. I will say no more lest it be a spoiler. And then to imagine John's wife as having the former life established for her in that same episode. Does not compute.A last complaint -- Sherlock Holmes has always been first and foremost about solving mysteries. This season is more about relationships. The main plot (the crime or puzzle to be solved) becomes almost a sub-plot.You may like the changes. You may not mind the rather frivolous attitude toward character development. I thought season 3 was clever in a sort of glib off-the-hand way, and it passed the time. It simply does not seamlessly connect with what came before.

1664048,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B00E3UN44W,Graves,"[2, 3]","The 3rd series of Sherlock came after a nearly two year wait as fans ached to learn how did Sherlock survive the terrible drop off the building at the end of season 2. We still don't know how he survived but it's so well done we don't care.Part of the fun of this series is the interaction between Holmes and Watson and that is the driving force here. Each time Holmes tries to tell Watson what happened, Watson, furious with his friend won't let him and yet their adventure is told in such a good way, we, the viewers, don't really feel let down that we don't know.There are three stories and while the character interaction is good the stories are inconsistent.  In the empty Hearse, Holmes returns, seemingly from the dead and surprises Watson. Watson's response at the shock is perfectly normal and surprised no one except Holmes. Lamentably the adventure they're on seems far too much like the movie V for Vendetta, without Steven Fry, for there to be much challenge there though for Sherlockians there are quotes taken directly form Doyle that show the depth of the friend's feelings, even when facing death.The Sign of Three is the comedy piece of the series. Holmes is asked to be Watson's best man and since this requires grace, charm and social wit-all things Holmes is lacking it's just lucky that a murder mystery comes up to prevent Watson form murdering his best man after the best man starts his duties by insulting the assembled guests and panicking the police force.The last story has Holmes matching wits with a blackmailer while Watson is given a greater insight into Holmes family. Imagine the Holmes family at Xmas and one thinks a Manson Family xmas might be safer for your mental health.  The episode does end with a set up for the 4th season but it isn't the OMG sort of cliff hanger that has marked the last two series.So in the end we're left with 3 very good adventures, not so much for the mysteries but the friendship between the two principals. Cumberbatch's ""high functioning sociopath"" who is sometimes befuddled by unexpected human reactions to his words and Freeman's Watson, a man sometimes ready to burst with frustration at his friend's antics combine as ultimately a story of two great friends who's only real question to each other when called upon through death defying adventures and the horror of a wedding is ""What do you need me to do?""",5,A great adventure goes on between two friends,1392768000,"02 19, 2014",2014,2380,"['3rd', 'series', 'Sherlock', 'came', 'nearly', 'two', 'year', 'wait', 'fans', 'ached', 'learn', 'how', 'did', 'Sherlock', 'survive', 'terrible', 'drop', 'building', 'end', 'season', '2', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'survived', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'care.Part', 'fun', 'series', 'interaction', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'driving', 'force', 'here', 'time', 'Holmes', 'tell', 'Watson', 'what', 'happened', 'Watson', 'furious', 'friend', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'yet', 'adventure', 'told', 'such', 'good', 'way', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'let', 'down', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.There', 'are', 'three', 'stories', 'character', 'interaction', 'good', 'stories', 'are', 'inconsistent', 'empty', 'Hearse', 'Holmes', 'seemingly', 'dead', 'surprises', 'Watson', 'Watson', 'response', 'shock', 'perfectly', 'normal', 'surprised', 'one', 'Holmes', 'Lamentably', 'adventure', ""'re"", 'far', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'Steven', 'Fry', 'be', 'much', 'challenge', 'there', 'Sherlockians', 'are', 'quotes', 'taken', 'directly', 'form', 'Doyle', 'show', 'depth', 'friend', 'feelings', 'even', 'when', 'facing', 'death.The', 'Sign', 'Three', 'comedy', 'piece', 'series', 'Holmes', 'asked', 'be', 'Watson', 'best', 'man', 'grace', 'charm', 'social', 'wit-all', 'things', 'Holmes', 'lacking', 'just', 'lucky', 'murder', 'mystery', 'up', 'prevent', 'Watson', 'form', 'murdering', 'best', 'man', 'best', 'man', 'duties', 'insulting', 'assembled', 'guests', 'panicking', 'police', 'force.The', 'last', 'story', 'Holmes', 'matching', 'wits', 'blackmailer', 'Watson', 'given', 'greater', 'insight', 'Holmes', 'family', 'Imagine', 'Holmes', 'family', 'Xmas', 'one', 'Manson', 'Family', 'xmas', 'might', 'be', 'safer', 'mental', 'health', 'episode', 'end', 'set', 'up', '4th', 'season', ""n't"", 'OMG', 'sort', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'marked', 'last', 'two', 'series.So', 'end', ""'re"", 'left', '3', 'very', 'good', 'adventures', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'mysteries', 'friendship', 'two', 'principals', 'Cumberbatch', 'high', 'functioning', 'sociopath', 'who', 'sometimes', 'befuddled', 'unexpected', 'human', 'reactions', 'words', 'Freeman', 'Watson', 'man', 'sometimes', 'ready', 'burst', 'frustration', 'friend', 'antics', 'combine', 'ultimately', 'story', 'two', 'great', 'friends', 'who', 'only', 'real', 'question', 'other', 'when', 'called', 'death', 'defying', 'adventures', 'horror', 'wedding', 'What', 'do', 'need', 'do']",N/A

Like Watson said, aren't there enough psychopaths on the show?  Can't we have one normal, down to earth character?  Is that too much to ask?  Mary represented the one grounded member in this crew of mental patients.  She was a necessary character with a much needed role to play.

She was cute, maternal, likeable, with quirky wholesome qualities.  She encouraged the friendship of Sherlock and Watson and brought levity and sanity to the show.  Now we find out she's a psychotic mass murderer?  WHY!!  I really liked her the way she was.  She made the group fun, being the possible damsel in distress, but not a slouch.  What worked in the traditional Sherlock Holmes programs was the fact the Sherlock was the only nutcase in the room.  He shocked and surprised everyone around him.  He dashed conventions in genteel England and it was fun watching everyone react to his lunacy.  And Miss Hudson was the lovable, caring foil who reigned Sherlock in when required.

1664084,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,B00E3UN44W,Joanna Daneman,"[1, 1]","""Meet the Makers, Part 2"" is a background video to the Sherlock series. As to the series, I wasn't convinced at first I wanted a new Sherlock Holmes. I couldn't imagine anyone surpassing Jeremy Brett, who did a series for Granada TV in the mid 80's to mid 90's. He was so much what I imagined Holmes from the Conan Doyle books that I wasn't prepared for a modernized Sherlock Holmes.Was I ever wrong. One episode, I was hooked. I was so smitten with Season 1 and 2 of ""Sherlock"" that I couldn't wait for Season 3. The enigmatic and appealing Benedict Cumberbatch grabs your attention, and Martin Freeman is outstanding as the Afghanistan (how ironic) war veteran Dr. Watson. His real-life partner Amanda Abbington plays Mary Morstan. She's fabulous and a welcome addition to the series (a good female regular, whom I like better than the lovelorn Molly.) I only worry, because in the original Sherlock stories by A. Conan Doyle, Watson's wives come and go with the frequency of Sherlock's cases, here one sentence, gone the next chapter! They die like mayflies! I hope Mary stays on--she is perfect in the role and not a pretty, vacuous face. She has meat in this part.The skyline of modern London is a character itself--the beautiful scene with Sherlock gazing over London, with the ""Gherkin"" building and the Eye in panorama is pure joy.The first two episodes (Empty Hearse and The Sign of Three) are not perfect--they don't approach the absolute perfection of the Scandal in Belgravia, which to me is the best of all the episodes. They are sometimes a bit self-conscious (yes, we all love Sherlock's coat collar pulled up to his amazing cheekbones, we get that) and sometimes outright silly. (Though the long wedding speech is a very clever method of storytelling. Unrealistic as a best-man's speech but at the same time, a fantastic way to unravel a puzzling case, a case worthy of Sherlock Holmes.)The final episode of Season 3, ""His Last Vow"", is a tour-de-force and to me, equal to ""Scandal in Belgravia"" but without the sex appeal. Instead, we have deep relationships: Watson&Holmes;, Watson&Watson;,Sherlock&Mycroft; and even the Holmes parental units (played by Cumberbatch's real-life professional actor parents.) The juicy Janine from ""Sign of Three"" reprises her role. Does Sherlock break his vow of celibacy?

Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman were otherwise engaged in New Zealand and other places filming The Hobbit trilogy, but fear not, once they returned they found time to make three excellent new episodes of our favorite detective series: ""The Empty Hearse,"" ""The Sign of Three,"" and ""His Last Vow.""  Each episode is approximately 90 minutes long.  The two DVD set also includes three intriguing featurettes ""The Fall,"" ""Villains and Speculation,"" and ""Shooting Sherlock.""When I first heard that the Sherlock Holmes stories were being redramatized set in the 21st century I cringed in horror.  Nothing is so quintessential Holmesian as gas lamps, hansom cabs, and Victorian clothing, I thought.  How wrong I was! These reimaginings of Doyle's stories with skyscrapers and smartphones are brilliant achievements.In Season 3 we see Holmes reintroduced to the world.  The mystery behind what actually happened on top of the Reichenbach tower is resolved, (or is it?)  Moriarty is dead (perhaps), but there's another master criminal at work. John Watson's life has taken a new turn into wedded bliss (possibly), but his often exasperated devotion to Holmes continues.  It's all great fun and extremely fast paced (you'll want to keep a finger on the Reverse button so you can make sure you actually saw or heard what you think you did.)  I think my own favorite of these episodes has to be the second one, but I can't really explain why lest I give away too much of the plot.As is PBS's normal practice parts of each episode were edited out before they were broadcast, so the complete BBC versions to be found in this set will contain some scenes and dialogue which will be new to Americans.

Larsen ""Larso""","[2, 3]","So here we are at Series Three and while not quite as tight as the best episodes of the first two efforts, there is still a lot to like. The highlight remains the witty banter between the two stars. The way their relationship is explored through the events depicted is extremely entertaining. Holmes' social awkwardness and Watson's pugnacious nature are on display to great effect. As for the actual episodes themselves, Holmes' wedding speech and the odious villain in episode three were the highlights. The show continues to be deliciously physical and it's almost worth keeping a list of the reasons various friends get to punch or slap Holmes. While this is a superbly written series that updates the original characters in interesting and highly entertaining ways, there are occasional plot developments that seem a bit far-fetched or are in some way unsatisfying. These moments are very much in the minority though. Sherlock continues to be a leading contributor to what is a Golden Age in television.

The trench coat and flapped cap look like they were made for him.  Where others see problems, his Holmes sees only puzzles that are fun to solve.  Emotionally cold and Aspergerish, he is always at least one step ahead of everyone, and as a viewer you are always jumping to try to keep up.

1664090,AZC562U18BK2S,B00E3UN44W,J. R. Trtek,"[8, 13]","This series has inspired more mood swings in me than I care to count. I initially had a disappointing reaction to Season One, feeling that while there was incredible wit and invention in the updating of Holmes and company, the characters were really new personages using the old names. I also was put off by what I considered somewhat muddled storytelling that employed far too many coincidences and easy ways out situations. Eventually, however, I grudgingly found myself liking these versions of Holmes and Watson so much that I was able to live with the first three tales in the series. Season Two struck me as an improvement, in the sense that the characters seemed a bit more in line with the originals, though Sherlock himself struck me as still too childish and unmindful of others. Indeed, I liked everything about Season Two except the constant sticking point: Very poor plots.The end of the sophomore year set us up for The Return, since at the end of the sixth episode Holmes had stepped off the top of a building and presumably died, as confirmed by Watson himself. Yet we knew Sherlock would come back -- the only question was, how would he have done it? Sadly, Season Three never tells us. In the episode ""The Empty Hearse,"" we get three hypothetical answers, all of them ludicrous in the extreme, but never an honest, truthful one. So, well, I guess we just take The Return as a given. I guess Sherlock is so damned good that logical justifications and explanation are unnecessary. There is hubris, and then there is hubris. Obviously, the writers of this series have that quality in abundance.The episode ""The Sign of Three"" hinges upon a method of murder that makes no sense to me. I can't go into detail for fear of spraying the reader with spoilers, but despite the argument for why the victim would not die immediately, would he or she not feel the wound being created? Moreover, we are told at one point that various witnesses have no connection with one another, while minutes later we find out that they do. Ridiculous.The final installment, which for some unknown reason transforms the canonical Charles Augustus Milverton into Charles Augustus Magnussen, once more drags us through a murky tale whose chief revelation once more is plagued by plot holes and inconsistencies. As I think at least one other reviewer has noted, Season Three drops most of the pretense of mystery in favor of displaying the characters again and again in situations that are endlessly repetitious in tone and, almost, in content. The series is getting drunk on itself. Up to now, I could look the other way when it came to bad storytelling. Not this time around. The Sherlock Schtick is getting old and not enough to enthrall.

Benedict makes you wonder just how narrowly Sherlock missed having a ""Dark Passenger"" of his own.the major new development is that Watson finally meets and marries Mary Morstan. this could've been shaky ground because there is no greater line drawn in the sand of the ""Sacred Canon."" even those who don't neccesarily resent her for breaking the boys up sometimes wonder what was the point, since Watson still accompanies Sherlock on as many adventures after the wedding. but the redoubtable Moffat and Gatiss managed to make something completely fitting out of the character. only i can't say what because it'd be a ""spoiler."" (i know, most of the audience would know by know, but there are still motions we have to go through. what about people who don't become fans until a couple years from now?)the major villain this year is Charles Augustus Magnussen, nee' Milverton, who's extortion currently takes the form of tabloid journalism. i said in another review that Milverton is such a great villain that even Moriarty wouldn't want to find himself at his mercy, and the claim stands with Magnussen. this is ironic, given that Moriarty is a genuinely malevolent troublemaker, whereas Milverton/Magnussen isn't much more than an opportunist. where the former wreaks genuine havoc as sort of his hobby, the later is simply trying to make a not-so-honest buck. measured by Sherlock's precious ""cold reason,"" Moriarty is the more dangerous. yet, even Sherlock expresses a passionate hatred toward Magnussen, where his feelings toward Moriarty were basically indignation. so the same hats-off to Lars Mikkelson that Andrew Scott earned a season ago.(which would i rather meet down the proverbial dark alley on the proverbial dark night? i'd rather not have to make that choice, quite frankly.)one of the cool things about the series is that it makes more room for character study than many prior Sherlock productions have managed. even in the comparatively easygoing form of Basil Rathbone, you just knew Sherlock Holmes had to be an occasionally frustrating person to live with. but it's not an angle that was very much explored before now, possibly because it's the sort of incidental matter that's easy to trim away if the pace starts to slag or whatever. (even Doyle only managed to mention their domestic squabbles in passing once or twice.) the series continues it's tradition of exploring the characters, this year to the seeming expense of the action. it's not really until Magnussen's entrance in ""His Last Vow"" that the good-vs.-evil element makes it all the way to centerstage, and even then it gets a bit sidetracked by character issues.""The Empty Hearse"" has two driving forces. the first is the aforementioned futile attempt to determine how Sherlock managed not to die. there's a nifty satire of conspiracy theories here. besides, as Steven Moffat says, why would Sherlock Holmes tell anybody?the real drama, though, boils down to Sherlock begging Watson's forgiveness. those who know their ""Sacred Canon"" will remember that the original Watson got it out of his system with a simple faint, but writer Mark Gatiss wondered how realistic that was. certainly Martin Freeman's Watson never seemed to sort who could forgive such a manipulation so easily.""The Sign Of Three"" is ultimately a virtual stream-of-consciousness: Sherlock's best man toast basically lists anecdotes from their exploits before the key to a case he couldn't quite crack distracts him completely. of course, through the magic of television, the revelation is just in time to prevent a potential tragedy right there at the wedding, so it's all good.what's more, the season became something of a family affair. Mary Morstan is played by Amanda Abbington, currently Martin Freeman's significant other. and we meet Sherlock's parents, as played by Benedict's parents.in short the season doesn't disappoint. it goes off on a couple of left-field tangents which make you wonder if it will, but ultimately it doesn't dare. Sherlock, Watson, and Company and Moffat, Gatiss, and Company alike know better than to let us down.the big question is, is the third time indeed the ""charm,"" or can they put it off a fourth? i

1664093,A1DX59TMRMY9NN,B00E3UN44W,Judith McKenzie,"[2, 3]","I have been a huge fan of this series, and think that Seasons 1 & 2 were flat-out brilliant.  I loved watching all of Season 3, and am still astounded both by Martin Freeman's portrayal of Watson, and how Watson has been written in this show - a much closer Watson to the intelligent and articulate Watson in the books than I have seen in ANY other filmed version.  However, there are some flaws this season - there is a bit too much focus on film technique and less on the mystery, the deductions, the depth of character.  I think Magnusson was very badly overdone - he's a very awful villain, but actually TOO awful - I literally cringed at scenes he was in.  Andrew Scot's portrayal of Moriarity, on the other hand, made me laugh out loud with delight over and over, even (maybe especially) when he was being evil.  Not only was he written brilliantly, but Scott's acting is flawless.  And that leads me to the final flaw I found - I knew (from the end of Season 2) that they would have to find a way to bring Moriarity back, so the &#34;surprise&#34; at the end of Season 3 was no surprise to me.  And I wanted to be surprised.  I do, however, have high hopes for season 4 with the return of Scott's Moriarity - and I hope I'm not disappointed.  Get back to Sherlock's ability to reason, and Watson's ability to humanize him, and throw in Andrew Scott's brilliant acting, and it should be a fine season.",4,Not as Good as Your French!,1393113600,"02 23, 2014",2014,1407,"['have', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'series', 'think', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'were', 'flat-out', 'brilliant', 'loved', 'watching', 'Season', '3', 'am', 'still', 'astounded', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'portrayal', 'Watson', 'how', 'Watson', 'been', 'written', 'show', 'much', 'closer', 'Watson', 'intelligent', 'articulate', 'Watson', 'books', 'have', 'seen', 'ANY', 'other', 'filmed', 'version', 'However', 'are', 'flaws', 'season', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'focus', 'film', 'technique', 'less', 'mystery', 'deductions', 'depth', 'character', 'think', 'Magnusson', 'was', 'very', 'badly', 'overdone', 'very', 'awful', 'villain', 'actually', 'TOO', 'awful', 'literally', 'cringed', 'scenes', 'was', 'Andrew', 'Scot', 'portrayal', 'Moriarity', 'other', 'hand', 'made', 'out', 'loud', 'delight', 'even', 'maybe', 'especially', 'when', 'was', 'being', 'evil', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'written', 'brilliantly', 'Scott', 'acting', 'flawless', 'final', 'flaw', 'found', 'knew', 'end', 'Season', '2', 'would', 'have', 'find', 'way', 'bring', 'Moriarity', 'back', '34', 'surprise', '34', 'end', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'surprise', 'wanted', 'be', 'surprised', 'do', 'however', 'have', 'high', 'hopes', 'season', '4', 'return', 'Scott', 'Moriarity', 'hope', ""'m"", 'not', 'disappointed', 'Get', 'back', 'Sherlock', 'ability', 'reason', 'Watson', 'ability', 'humanize', 'throw', 'Andrew', 'Scott', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'should', 'be', 'fine', 'season']",N/A

1664096,A10872FHIJAKKD,B00E3UN44W,Just Bill,"[10, 15]","My wife and I own Seasons One and Two of this brilliant show on Blu-ray. We watch all six of those episodes constantly. So we were waiting on pins and needles for Season Three to air and we sat in front of our TV the night it did......only to shake our heads when it was over and think, ""What happened?""The first episode of Season Three lacks the pizzazz and charm of the first two seasons. In fact, it almost appears to be a different show. Here's why:1. The explanation as to how Sherlock faked his own death was way beyond convoluted, unbelievable, and just plain hokey. It made no logical sense at all. For Sherlock to pull together a massive team to help him -- who all kept totally silent! -- stretches credibility to the breaking point.2. It was disjointed and choppy, filmed as if by an apoplectic camera operator. The storyline hopped around as often as the camera did. Quick cut, quick cut, quick cut...close up, close up, close up. It was distracting.3. Two years? TWO YEARS? Nearly every character but poor John Watson knew Sherlock was still alive. TWO FREAKIN' YEARS?!?!? I realize Sherlock is a sociopath. But that's just plain cruel.4. The writing - by co-creator and actor Mark Gatiss - tried too hard to be clever and, instead, had to settle for frenetic.Compare Season Three, Episode One with any previous episode. Watch them side by side, back to back -- doesn't matter. Season Three, Episode One is darker, less coherent, more focused on action than on character...In short, we were so unimpressed by the first episode that we forgot there was a second episode airing the next week. For us, that's akin to blasphemy and punishable by death. That's how big of Sherlock fans we were.There's something off about Season Three.Your mileage may vary.NOTE: I see a phenomenon happening with Sherlock that I do with Downton Abbey - a host of dubious 5-star reviews, all supposedly from Amazon Verified purchasers, all about a sentence or two in length, all not saying much at all other than ""Great Show!"" These short ""reviews"" appear in bursts from time to time. Methinks the game is afoot.***UPDATE***My wife and I watched the third episode last night -- and fell asleep about a half hour into it, something we would never have dreamed of with any episode from the first two seasons.This morning, we talked about it. I think we know what's wrong with Season 3.What made the first two seasons special was the fact that Holmes and Watson lived together and were often mistaken for a couple, which ticked off Watson to no end. They were very close, and their banter reflected that.Consequently, the show was about those two.Now, thanks to Watson's marriage, and Holmes'""girlfriend,"" the show is not just about Holmes and Watson; it's about the lives of two separate people who now only occasionally interact to solve a case.Which means, a large portion of the magic is gone.The Sherlock Homes canon is vast - some 56 short stories and four novels - so Moffat and Gatiss did not have to introduce Watson's wife this early in the series, if they did at all.We think doing so threw off the chemistry and radically altered the interplay, which made the show so special.Whatever the reason, we went from being two of the world's biggest Sherlock fans to falling sleep watching the show.One more thing: the camera work in episode three was as choppy and disruptive as it was in episode one. It seems someone behind the scenes (producer? director? writer?) knows the material is weak. So there's been an effort to try to make what's happening on the screen seem more kinetic, rather than static. Doesn't work. Like Holmes exclaimed in one of the early (first two seasons) episodes: ""Bored!"")",3,First Two Seasons...Flawless!

Perhaps this one should be compared to the Hendrix song, &#34;1983... (A Merman I Should Turn to Be)&#34; from the Electric Ladyland album.  For those not familiar with Hendrix (is that possible?), he played guitar backwards functionally but turned the rock guitar world upside down with his creative use of pedals and feedback while playing the instrument behind his back, with his teeth, against a microphone stand, and simply blowing away the boundaries of the genre.  This is what the makers of Sherlock have done with Arthur Conan Doyle's novels...you know it is basically the same cast of characters, but they are also brand new iterations of all former depictions.

In Season 3, they are reaching that limit: the episodes are overwritten, Sherlock may be turning into someone interesting, but that someone is soon to be Sherlock Holmes in name only, and the quirks that made Cumberbatch's Sherlock so endearing in Seasons 1 and 2 are in danger of becoming shticks. The show's creators are overloading the episodes with too many superfluous tricks of the ""Oh, come on,"" sort.That said, it is still enjoyable to watch Cumberbatch, who is never less than interesting.

1664117,A136MAOWGCU2C2,B00E3UN44W,K.T. May,"[2, 4]","When it comes to British television, we Americans love two programs primarily: Doctor Who and Sherlock.  Both are currently written by a man whom we equally love and loathe (Steven Moffat), and for both shows we must wait an inordinate amount of time for new episodes (a time which hasn&#8217;t been paying off so well lately in the Who department).  It hasn&#8217;t even been a full week yet since we finished the third series of Sherlock, and we already miss it.  Though, if the rumors are to be believed, we&#8217;re going to continue missing it for quite some time, as Moffat has hinted that the release date for series four may not occur until 2016.  Ugh.But, thankfully, there&#8217;s always Netflix, re-runs, and our DVRs to tide us over.  Granted, by 2016, you could probably re-watch Sherlock to the point where you could recite verbatim the lines from every episode, but at least there&#8217;s the option to re-watch it, unlike back in the day where once you missed it or watched it, it was gone.  Now, you Cumberbitches and Freeman...fans(?) can analyze to the death for the next year (or more) the morsels you were given this month, which is pretty fulfilling in theory but is, in fact, crumbs when you have to wait as long as we do for more.In any event, here are some of our favorite moments from series three to obsess over while we oh-so-patiently (but not really, because what choice were we given?) wait.That KissOkay, so when Sherlock initially busts through the window and kisses Molly Hooper in the first episode, you&#8217;re not sure what to feel.  At first, you&#8217;re psyched, because admit it - that scene was pretty damn sexy.  Then, you&#8217;re happy for Molly, because you can a) put yourself in her position and therefore b) understand how happy she must be in that moment.  But then you find yourself getting upset because wait a minute, Sherlock never expressed a desire for a female companion in the books, and he certainly never kissed one (and if he should be kissing anyone, it should be Irene Adler), so what the hell Moffat, are you taking your poetic license a little too far again?  But no, thankfully, this was all just a fantasy concocted by &#8220;the fans&#8221; (one of Moffat&#8217;s many in-jokes), and one we can appreciate better later on upon further inspection.When Sherlock Reveals Himself to WatsonImagine your best friend has been gone for a couple of years, faked you out by pretending he or she was dead, then showed up at the restaurant you and your soon-to-be-betrothed were dining at, interrupting you in the middle of your proposal.  You&#8217;d be pretty happy/pissed off/relieved, too.  Martin Freeman is a master of conveying a multitude of emotions via facial expression.  So too is Benedict Cumberbatch a master of pretending to lack emotion while simultaneously lacking the ability to understand it in others.  He&#8217;s Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory if Sheldon were forced out of a sitcom and into real life - and in Britain.  And Freeman reminds us of Bernard, the mouse, from The Rescuers: Down Under as he&#8217;s about to propose to his girlfriend, Bianca.  It&#8217;s just as easy to rattle his feathers.The StyleOne of the best things about Sherlock is its style.  Like the morphine drip meter scrolling up, and then down, on Sherlock&#8217;s arm, or the messages that scroll across the screen when someone gets an incoming text, or the several words that are thrown at us at once when Sherlock is doing his deducing, like the words in the foreground of a screensaver.  One of the things we miss about the show when it&#8217;s gone, and one of the things that is brilliant enough to forgive even Moffat for, is its sheer originality in showing, not telling (but still telling).MycroftWasn&#8217;t Mark Gatiss simply mesmerizing this season as Mycroft?  Sure, he&#8217;s been enjoyable in the past, but his character really got a chance to shine this season, and we saw how startlingly evil he could be (like the &#8220;Just look frightened and scuttle&#8221; speech), and how not-quite-good-not-quite-bad he could be in sending his brother off to what could be assumed to be a suicide mission as penance for murdering Magnusson, only to bring him back four minutes later to contend with......The Return of MoriartyOkay, so we don&#8217;t yet know how the hell this one is going to work, and frankly, we don&#8217;t care.  We&#8217;re just excited that Andrew Scott is possibly back to reprise his role as Sherlock&#8217;s ultimate nemesis.  Granted, we watched him blow his own brains out, but we&#8217;ve seen Moffat pull his way out of a painted corner several times on Who and enough times on Sherlock to consider it a viable possibility.  Maybe we weren&#8217;t seeing the whole picture.  Maybe it was a fantasy concocted by a drug-addled Holmes.  Maybe it was fake blood.  Or a fake gun.  Or who knows what.  Heck, we still probably don&#8217;t even really know how Sherlock escaped from that roof alive.  Do you believe the story he told Anderson?

Yes, they got around the Mary Watson is dead problem from the books, but to have morally upstanding Watson married to a killer? Yeah, not buying it. At all.I have no problem with Moffat and Company playing with the ACD timeline in their quest from A to Z, but in the end I want Sherlock and John retired together and Sherlock tending his bees! *g* Not sure how that will happen given this latest plot twist with John Watson as daddy/husband.

1664132,A2VF25F0XZHXMW,B00E3UN44W,London Fog,"[258, 362]","ETA: January 17, 2014It would not be an exaggeration to say my first viewing of 'A Study In Pink' was a Holmesian experience like no other - I actually remember thinking this must have been how fresh and innovative and clever SCAN was to the Victorians. To this day, I regard that first episode as one of the greatest Sherlock Holmes adaptations, though while it's only fair to review this series based on its own merits, let me first begin by saying that while I have always enjoyed the plot deviations, Sherlock has strayed so far from its roots, I no longer regard it as something even loosely based on Doyle's characters.Despite complaints from certain quarters, I enjoyed The Empty Hearse immensely, even overlooking my hesitations regarding John's less than ebullient reaction to his friend's return, whose literal and metaphorical blow was softened nicely with humor. All the tension that had been building from the last series' cliffhanger was alleviated cleverly with the tongue-in-cheek way in which it was approached. I give Mr Gatiss a good deal of credit for what he created out of the corner he could have very well been painted into had the resolution taken itself too seriously. Much as I loved 'Sherlock', I found the complaints this episode was terribly out of character to be baseless - it did, of course, have moments of such, but then again, this has been a running theme throughout the series, and I have always in the past forgiven such instances when the episode itself was solid.The Sign Of Three was phenomenal. It was not conventionally plotted, but did have several plot threads, one of which becomes the main puzzle for Sherlock to solve during the wedding. In all honesty, I actually felt that the fan service was slacking and the program was getting back to its roots as a crime drama, albeit a more lighthearted one. The glimpses we get of Sherlock and John in their ""off hours"" was lovely, and Mary was scripted so well this was the first time in the umpteen adaptations I have read/watched that I really felt we were being given those scraps of what Watson tells us about her in Canon. Bits of OOC behaviors ran through the episode, though this came to a head during parts of the wedding reception's end - my honest assessment being this was Benedict Cumberbatch at a wedding, not any incarnation of Sherlock Holmes.This was a very disappointing turn of events, but while I was beginning to regard series 3 as more of an AU adaptation where suspension of belief is required, the second episode still managed to become one of my favorites.What happened with His Last Vow, where precisely it went so irredeemably wrong, I am not certain, but veer off course it did, and it was somewhere towards the middle of this episode that it occurred to me I no longer had any emotional investment in this program anymore, because to do so would have made me utterly disgusted. I had severe problems with parts of A Scandal In Belgravia, as I felt Irene Adler was not done justice to, nor could I reconcile some of Sherlock's behavior and that love interest claptrap. Even so, the supporting characters were strong, especially Martin Freeman's John, who has been like a lighthouse in a storm throughout instances of weak scripting.If you have any great wish to despise this world and the wonderful characters that once inhabited it, then by all means, watch His Last Vow. Even if one comes into this series with no background knowledge of the books, there are deep-seated issues that simply cannot be ignored. There was so much wrong here, I cannot even find a suitable place to begin. There was promise in the first 20-30 minutes, but had Moffat been writing fan fiction he would have been ""flamed"" for character bashing of the worst kind. It was made astoundingly clear that he has no qualms whatsoever with turning the characterizations of all major and several minor players on their head, for what reason I am unable to discern. For that matter, he seems to be perfectly fine with making Holmes mentally deficient, as any acumen possessed by the detective or cerebral merit of the program was entirely lost. Plainly spoken, Moffat's Holmes was painfully stupid.Suffice it to say, Moffat has absolutely no concept of what characterization is, much less how it naturally evolves in one's writing, and all the nonsense from ASiB and this last episode was made perfectly clear when he makes several blatant references plucked straight from the pages of Baring-Gould. He presents himself as being some sort of Holmesian expert, but if any of his fodder is coming from that particular avenue, it explains his shoddy take on Sherlock Holmes and his inability to write the man to save his life.But that's not to say he only managed to run Holmes through the mud, here. No, he had to drag Mary (in the most abominable of ways - I don't care how the issue was resolved!!!), Molly, even to a small extent Mrs Hudson and John through the mud. This craving for danger he's given John Watson is deplorable. In Canon, his sole interest in Holmes was bourne of a scientific curiosity (""the greatest study of mankind is man""), which grew into a mutual love and respect on both their parts. Here, John is just a cheap thrill seeker who is pretty much a psychopath himself and seeks out his like - i.e. Sherlock & Mary.So. I do honestly believe the first two episodes, even with their faults, were deserving of high marks, hence my three star rating, which I think is being generous. Taken for what it is, this was great entertainment of a far superior quality to 99.9% of shows on television. I was willing to continue watching even with the deviations, to simply enjoy it as a crime drama if nothing else. Unfortunately, I do not foresee any improvements whatsoever with Moffat at the helm, and unless he is thrown overboard in the capacity of a writer, I will not be watching series four. I simply do not care what happens anymore, a sad thing to admit of a program that was once one of the best and wisest I had ever known.",3,"First Two Episodes Outstanding...

1664165,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00E3UN44W,mirasreviews,"[11, 16]","To say that Series 3 of ""Sherlock"" is not up to the standard of the previous seasons understates the fact and misses the point. The writers weren't even trying to write mysteries or, it seems, plots at all. And they certainly weren't trying to write characters. The episodes are ""The Empty Hearse"", ""The Sign of Three"", and ""The Last Vow"". The first two involve mysteries but no detective work. The third is not a mystery. Two years after Sherlock's (Benedict Cumberbatch) supposed death, Dr. Watson (Martin Freeman) has moved out of 221B Baker Street and gone back to practicing medicine. He has plans to marry his girlfriend Mary Morstan (Amanda Abbington). Mycroft Holmes (Mark Gatiss) is still the UK's puppetmaster. Mrs. Hudson is still entrenched (Una Stubbs). Molly Hooper (Louise Brealey), the pathologist, has moved on to another man. Then Sherlock reappears.""The Empty Hearse"" takes the easy way out with Sherlock exonerated of all wrongdoing in his absence. The writers like to toy with those who want to know how Sherlock staged his demise, and that provides the filler needed to plump this episode out to 90 minutes. All three episodes contain enormous quantities of filler. It's no wonder, as they do not actually contain plots. The writers did not attempt to base these episodes on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books or stories, except for some inspiration ""His Last Vow"" takes from ""The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton"". That's unfortunate, because the writers badly needed the discipline that adapting a story would have provided. Instead we have stories -if you can call them that- that take a painful amount of time to start, don't involve detection, and are all theatrics and no substance.Sherlock is not so much a character anymore as a hyperactive performing seal. Benedict Cumberbatch is doing Sherlock schtick these days, which involves making a lot of faces, while Sherlock travels to his ""mind palace"" -a lot of quick cutting there- which is beyond tedious. The ""mind palace"" is also frequently employed as filler. Sherlock veers between being mawkishly sentimental and casually and deliberately cruel. He plays with people's emotions where he used to ignore them. He has developed a sharp social insight, so he has no excuse for ignoring others' feelings now. His newfound concern for what everyone thinks of him, and tendency to express undying devotion to them, will induce nausea. Sherlock has been reduced to a collection of bizarre mannerisms. His behavior is characterized by sentimentality and changeability.The banter between Sherlock and brother Mycroft and between Sherlock and Dr. Watson, which has always been entertaining, is now boring. Another genre of filler. Perhaps having one entire episode -""The Sign of Three""- revolve around a Best Man's speech is not a horrible idea, if Sherlock can cleverly solve a mystery while he's droning on. He does that, for maybe 5 minutes. But the episode revolves around the speech, not the mystery, and it may be the longest speech in the history of wedding receptions. This stuff is literally difficult to sit through. ""His Last Vow"" is a lame excuse for a thriller, but it is not a mystery. The villainous blackmailer, called the most dangerous man in the world, has been praised to the heavens by the British press. But he barely has more than a walk-on presence and is utterly bland. There's nothing to him.Series 3 is about emotions, and Sherlock has the most of all. But we liked him because he didn't have the same emotions as other people, and because he couldn't understand those feelings. These three episodes were written by three different people: Mark Gatiss,  Stephen Moffat, and Stephen Thompson, who seems to have collaborated with the others on ""The Sign of Three"". It's a conspiracy. Moffat did the same thing to ""Doctor Who"". He wrote the reboot of that series in 2005, which was not really science fiction so much as an unbearably sappy soap opera. Same problem here. ""Sherlock"" Series 3 is not a detective show; it is a soap opera, and a lousy one. Tip: If you didn't see it on the BBC, be sure to look up the 7-minute short film ""Many Happy Returns"" on YouTube before watching Series 3. It takes place in the interim between Series 2 and 3.The episodes are:""The Empty Hearse"" opens as Sherlock Holmes has been cleared of all wrongdoing and reinstated as a hero in his absence. Brother Mycroft insists that Sherlock return to London to prevent an imminent terror attack. A British intelligence agent died to get information about an ""underground terror network"" in London, but no one has been able to uncover it. Amidst a string of unchallenging new cases, a former client finds an intriguing mystery for Sherlock: A man boarded the last subway car leaving the station one night...and disappeared before reaching the next station. Watson, meanwhile, did not take the news of Sherlock's resurrection well, and he's having a rough time back on the job. We are kept guessing as to how Sherlock's suicide was staged. The title of the episode refers to a club of conspiracy theorists who believed him to be alive.""The Sign of Three"" brings us to Watson's wedding day and Sherlock's greatest challenge: the Best Man's speech. Sherlock is secretly worried that he is losing a friend and partner, while Watson's fianc&eacute;e Mary (Amanda Abbington) has been trying her best to make both men feel secure and needed, even enlisting Sherlock as a wedding planner, a task to which he has dedicated himself obsessively. On the wedding day, the maid of honor Janine (Yasmine Akram) is pleased to have the advantage of Sherlock's powers of observation in sorting through the guests for eligible bachelors. A very long time is spent on Sherlock's speech, which naturally involves solving a mystery and flashbacks to a couple of old cases that turn out to be related. Unfortunately Sherlock is mawkish, out of character, and Mycroft is an annoying distraction in this episode for no reason.""His Last Vow"" begins as Lady Elizabeth Smallwood (Lindsay Duncan) is blackmailed by media mogul Charles Augustus Magnussen (Lars Mikkelsen), a man whose vast store of embarrassing materials puts him in a position to manipulate every person of power in the Western world. Not content to cave in, Lady Smallwood hires Sherlock Holmes to retrieve the problematic documents. Meanwhile, as John and Mary Watson are getting used to married life, a distraught neighbor asks for help in retrieving her missing son from a crackhouse. While there, Watson stumbles upon Sherlock, apparently in a drugged stupor. Sherlock insists that he was working on a case, and, when Mycroft realizes that Sherlock intends to take on Magnussen, he forbids his brother to do it. Sherlock gains access to Magnussen's office but gets the surprise of his life.",2,"Mawkish, Shallow, Nonsensical, Overlong, Boring.

1664166,A3HQWVI9URI3YC,B00E3UN44W,Mister Bonely,"[144, 167]","When I first watched The Empty Hearse, I felt a bit disenchanted. It was fast-paced in a different, very erratic--a word that several articles have used to describe this series so far--way. I wanted to laugh at the humorous bits, but didn't find them funny enough. It had just failed to meet my expectations, yet I was excited to be watching it. All-in-all, I felt absolutely nothing after finishing it, which is an altogether unfamiliar feeling for me after finishing an episode of Sherlock.About a couple of days later, however, I decided to revisit it, and haven't regretted my decision since.Maybe it's missing some of its old flair to some, but I think a lot of it has to do with the plain and simple fact that things have changed for both Sherlock and Watson. Sherlock's more human, and, in a sense, a bit weaker because of it, but he's still Sherlock (though I'm sure some would disagree)....And Watson? Well, he's said himself that two people have greatly changed his life: First Sherlock, then Mary. Mary is now in the picture--Watson's got a wife, and (skip this if you don't want spoilers) quite possibly a child along the way. Even in Doyle's works, this was a significant change in their lives, as it would be in anyone's life. When you put all this into consideration, the events of Series 3 aren't as surprising, and its mood is a bit different, but suitably so. It's still the show I fell in love with, I think, just headed in a new direction.Yes, sometimes Sherlock (in particular) feels a bit out of character, his actions and the reactions of others seem a bit absurd/irrational, and a lot of 'deductions' and other bits seem to be more bizarre/left unexplained. And, yes, it's definitely got more humour in it than before. And I'm sure some people feel that it's too obvious sometimes. That is the one complaint I will agree with wholeheartedly.When it comes to the loose ends, the bits that feel unexplained, though--these explanations that the 'fans' felt they deserved--I will say this: Even in the first two series/seasons of Sherlock, there have been a few inaccuracies and simply unrealistic occurrences. It's important to remember that this is a fictional detective show, and should be treated as such. As Sherlock rightly notes of John's blogs, real life doesn't quite  work like that way. Certain aspects are embellished. If you want realistic, watch a different detective/cop show. Though I guarantee it won't have the same feeling, the same excitement, the thrill, because these shows don't romanticize crime, murder, and the investigations involved quite the same way.For what it is, I like this series. The mood is different, sure, but it's still enjoyable, you just have to give it another chance. I'm still enjoying it immensely.I'll still be watching.(If not, take heart, you'll have an hour twenty minutes for the other things that call for your attention.)",5,Curious beginnings..,1388880000,"01 5, 2014",2014,2894,"['When', 'first', 'watched', 'Empty', 'Hearse', 'felt', 'bit', 'disenchanted', 'was', 'fast-paced', 'different', 'very', 'erratic', 'word', 'several', 'articles', 'have', 'used', 'describe', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'way', 'wanted', 'laugh', 'humorous', 'bits', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'funny', 'enough', 'had', 'just', 'failed', 'meet', 'expectations', 'yet', 'was', 'excited', 'be', 'watching', 'All-in-all', 'felt', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'finishing', 'altogether', 'unfamiliar', 'feeling', 'finishing', 'episode', 'Sherlock.About', 'couple', 'days', 'later', 'however', 'decided', 'revisit', 'have', ""n't"", 'regretted', 'decision', 'since.Maybe', 'missing', 'old', 'flair', 'think', 'lot', 'do', 'plain', 'simple', 'fact', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'Sherlock', 'Watson', 'Sherlock', 'more', 'human', 'sense', 'bit', 'weaker', 'still', 'Sherlock', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'disagree', 'Watson', 'Well', 'said', 'two', 'people', 'have', 'greatly', 'changed', 'life', 'First', 'Sherlock', 'then', 'Mary', 'Mary', 'now', 'picture', 'Watson', 'got', 'wife', 'skip', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoilers', 'quite', 'possibly', 'child', 'way', 'Even', 'Doyle', 'works', 'was', 'significant', 'change', 'lives', 'would', 'be', 'anyone', 'life', 'When', 'put', 'consideration', 'events', 'Series', '3', 'are', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'mood', 'bit', 'different', 'suitably', 'so', 'still', 'show', 'fell', 'love', 'think', 'just', 'headed', 'new', 'direction.Yes', 'sometimes', 'Sherlock', 'particular', 'bit', 'character', 'actions', 'reactions', 'others', 'seem', 'bit', 'absurd/irrational', 'lot', ""'deductions"", 'other', 'bits', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'bizarre/left', 'unexplained', 'yes', 'definitely', 'got', 'more', 'humour', 'before', ""'m"", 'sure', 'people', 'feel', 'too', 'obvious', 'sometimes', 'one', 'complaint', 'will', 'agree', 'wholeheartedly.When', 'loose', 'ends', 'bits', 'feel', 'unexplained', 'though', 'explanations', ""'fans"", 'felt', 'deserved', 'will', 'say', 'Even', 'first', 'two', 'series/seasons', 'Sherlock', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'inaccuracies', 'simply', 'unrealistic', 'occurrences', 'important', 'remember', 'fictional', 'detective', 'show', 'should', 'be', 'treated', 'such', 'Sherlock', 'rightly', 'John', 'blogs', 'real', 'life', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'way', 'Certain', 'aspects', 'are', 'embellished', 'want', 'realistic', 'watch', 'different', 'detective/cop', 'show', 'guarantee', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'feeling', 'same', 'excitement', 'thrill', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'romanticize', 'crime', 'murder', 'investigations', 'involved', 'quite', 'same', 'way.For', 'what', 'like', 'series', 'mood', 'different', 'sure', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'just', 'have', 'give', 'chance', ""'m"", 'still', 'enjoying', 'immensely.I', ""'ll"", 'still', 'be', 'watching', 'not', 'take', 'heart', ""'ll"", 'have', 'hour', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'other', 'things', 'call', 'attention']",N/A

Some may want only the fast-paced mystery, without the incidentals, but when the incidentals are needed, by all means, give them, and that, Stephen Moffat and Mark Gatiss did in the first two episodes of Series 3, still finding time for a little mystery along the way.I feel there is plenty of time for a driving mystery, but when you are re-introducing Sherlock (after his untimely death), and then firmly introducing Mary as the love of John's life, you must take some time to show how this all affects Sherlock's and john's relationship.Then, in Episode 3, we get down to what everyone wants (A GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED ""SHERLOCK"" MYSTERY) - while, ensuring that the ""picky fans"" (those not wanting ""background"" info to help develop the debt of the characters and move the story along) are not saying snippy things about the new characters, as well as the changes to the older ones.

1664177,A1WA032VVW2PC1,B00E3UN44W,"neichan ""neichan""","[2, 4]","My first impression is horrific disappointment that my much looked forward to Sherlock Season 3 has spent so much time on romance. The two main actors of course gave interviews stating the vaunted friendship is based on platonic love. Why that is important is that the reason many viewers so love the series created by Gatiss and Co. is that the relationship between the characters of Sherlock and Watson has a spark of that indefinable chemistry that can't ever be taken for granted. It is a gift when found, and troubling when squandered. And some fear it might be physical in nature. Silly, huh?There are many lovely moments, and many annoying ones. The irritation I felt at the romance that dominated the episodes while it weakened the cases isn't dimmed on a second viewing. Making Mary an Assassin is not a plus. Nor is making her a pregnant wife with the possibility in the future that there will be murderous people after Mary because of her past, the kind of people that would not be hesitant if it came to killing her children if they were in the way of getting to her.And yet, Freeman and Cumberbatch together remain scene stealers of such greatness I forget quite often that I am convinced of season three's position as my least favorite offering of Sherlock. The best man speech is brilliant.So. Then there is an oddly offensive moment where a joke played by Sherlock on John is over a ticking bomb. Is it Sherlock's attempt to punish John? Make him admit that for a moment Sherlock is the most important person in his life still? Who knows. The joke doesn't show any caring at all, it is rather vicious. And they supposedly love each other, (platonically of course)? Oh, yes, and the last case, Sherlock apparently gives up his life, ending up on a plane to face the East Wind, all for Mary and John's love.I am never a fan of romance muddling a wondrous show. Sherlock was my absolutely favorite show for the first 2 seasons. Now it is still good yet closer to an average good instead of stunningly incredible to watch. I do have to mention Molly stands out several times, most especially as a temporary John replacement at Sherlock's side. Great to watch her.I did have moments that I had to giggle, and hence the 4 stars, though I'd have preferred 3.5 stars. The version of Sherlock's suicide that had Moriarity and Sherlock sitting atop Barts and about to kiss.... Entirely implausible, but I'd have enjoyed that more than the way they chose to follow.... Season 3 being the season of Mary. Making the vaunted partnership of Sherlock and Watson more Sherlock, Watson and Watson(Mary). Putting the chemistry of Freeman and Cumberbatch on the back burner for much of the episodes.The news magnate as the bad guy is weak. I was actually relieved to see Moriarity in the end, and given how delighted I was when he took himself out of the game....Do I advise people to not watch? Of course not. The scene with Mycroft and Sherlock playing Operation is hysterical. The moving of John's chair... nostalgic and almost sweet. The actors who portray the three main stars, Mycroft, Watson and Sherlock are still so watchable. No, I am not including Mary. I find her intrusive. Yes, Mrs. Hudson is still so much fun. And Molly. Took me forever to recognize Anderson. Not enough Lestrade.Aren't we modern enough yet to have a Sherlock Holmes show that doesn't have to establish John's heterosexuality so firmly?",4,Gah!

1664185,A2GP36FGLXD9T2,B00E3UN44W,Oscar L. Colombo,"[2, 5]","Brilliant acting, great dialog, hilarious situations: it is ""Sherlock"" at its best. Also, very interesting DVD special features. But only four stars, because of a questionable explanation of ""how he did it"" and another two big holes in the plot.As in previous seasons, there are many tributes to the original stories by Conan Doyle which I always find witty and enjoyable, and keep discovering more every time I watch the show - and, at last count, I have watched the three episodes of Season 3 four times already, and have lost count of how many times those of Sessions 1 and 2. (For those who might be interested in reading the original stories: there is an inexpensive two-volume paperback edition of ""Sherlock Holmes, the Complete Novels and Stories"" published by Ballantine in its ""Classic"" series.)Now, to the problems I see with the plots of the latest ""Sherlock"" episodes.Gentle reader: if you happened to be one of the very few people in the planet that are fans of ""Sherlock"" but do not know by now ""how he did it"" and seen, or at least read or heard about the stories told in each of the three episodes of Season 3, please stop reading now!To everybody else who bother to keep reading: these are the problems with the plot I see that make the whole Season 3 deserve only four stars (this is, of course, just my own opinion, and there is always the possibility that I might be wrong).Episode 1, ""The Empty Hearse"": No matter how it was done, Jim Moriarty had people watching to see if Sherlock jumped and died -- or not -- in order to send word to go ahead to the hit men prepositioned to kill Inspector Lestrade, Ms. Hudson, and John Watson if he did not, and to call off the hit if he did. Those people had to be in places where they had a clear view of the front of the Hospital, including the likely impact area of Sherlock's body (were he to jump), namely the sidewalk. It was only John and we, the TV viewing audience, that shared his point of view, that were unable to see that place. Moriarti's people did not share this handicap. In fact, towards the end of the episode, we see what the sniper tasked with killing John saw through his rifle scope: the head of John, who, by then, was standing on the sidewalk next to where Sherlock was lying. Obviously, the sniper had had a clear view of that place all along and could not have failed to realize that the whole thing was just a trick, however cleverly done.Episode 2, ""The Sign of Three"": The case of ""The Bloody Guardsman"" involves stabbing through the abdomen from the back with a roast beef skewer, or some such implement. The victim not only does not feel the injury, but continues to do whatever he was doing for quite some time afterwards without noticing anything wrong (and that included eating a hearty meal in the case of Major James Sholto), in spite of having had, at the very least, their intestines and stomach perforated. The excuse offered for this was that both victims were wearing very tight military uniform belts, so they did not bleed outwardly. But: No deadly internal hemorrhages? Not going into shock pretty soon afterwards? Not excruciating pain (anybody that has ever been punched in the solar plexus or had a gastric ulcer knows that the intestines and stomach are very well innervated). And what was the (supposedly) clever assassin thinking when he ""experimented"" first with a guard of Buckingham Palace, while he was on duty at a place heavily guarded by much more than two ramrod stiff men in quaint uniforms? What if the ""experiment"" went wrong there and then?Episode 3, ""His Last Vow"": How did Sherlock and John manage to get John's gun (that he was carrying in his coat pocket when leaving Sherlock's parents' house) past the inevitable and very thorough weapons' search the fearsome (and, as seen earlier in the episode, thoroughly competent) minions of Charles Augustus Magnussen were going to subject them even before they would let them board their helicopter, let alone actually reach CAM's presence at his nest of villainy in ""Appledore""?Well ... I don't really mind that much the flaws I see in the stories, because I enjoyed them very much, warts and all, but I can't help wondering how they could have possibly been allowed to happen in a show of this extraordinarily high caliber, with such a huge, dedicated and attentive audience following it, obsessing over it, and fastidiously dissecting it, in the first place?",4,"Great show marred by

1664186,A2RZWFH56U59JF,B00E3UN44W,PatB,"[379, 486]","I'm a '60s kid, and much too old for fangirling, even if I was the right sex, but I'm addicted to the show as much as the fangirls are (though I draw the line at ""shipping""). Heck, though, Sherlock is testing my stamina as well as my hearing. Benedict Cumberbatch talks at roughly the speed computer chips used to go in the days before computer chips started going at the speed of light. Which is difficult enough for a brain like mine that only goes at the speed of clockwork, but on top of that you have the visual graffiti, those fly-past word-jumbles that litter the screen like a hallucinogenic Scrabble game every time some new character attracts Sherlock's gaze. It makes for an information-flow that is more than my cerebral cortex can process without overloading the circuits and causing smoke to leak from my ears.Still, there's always the good old BBC iPlayer where you can re-play the show at your leisure. I've seen two episodes so far, and careful analysis of the content tells me that Sherlock is still alive and Moriarty is still dead. That's about all I can say for a certainty, because in terms of comprehension I'm struggling along at the back of the pack.But certainty is not something you should look for in any case from Sherlock, which specializes in teasing the viewer. Steven Moffat is just one of three writers for the series, but it is his presence that is most strongly felt, even in episodes he didn't write. In many ways the psychology of the show occupies the same territory as Moffat's other show, Doctor Who, where comedy and drama can alternate several times within the space of a minute, and false scents and long-delayed payoffs are part of a strategy that seems increasingly audience-aware. In Episode 1, The Empty Hearse, Moffat goes as far as lampooning his own fans, or the hard-core at least, by dramatizing no less than three different solutions to Sherlock's faked death based on theories circulating on the internet since the Reichenbach Fall episode that seemingly killed him off (and then seemingly didn't). It's gone further than any show has before in breaking the ""fourth wall"", and is edging dangerously close to what would probably be called Deconstructionist drama, where the distinction between actors and audience is dissolved entirely, and where fictional structure falls into a Perception Paradox and implodes with a gentle sigh. No, I'm joking (I think).But say what you like about Moffat (and many bad things have been said), he's never boring. If this remarkable show is going to vanish down its own plughole, I'd like to be there to see it happen. In the meantime, here are some good reasons to keep watching:Martin Freeman as Dr Watson - surely the face-actor of all time. First seen as Tim Canterbury in The Office (UK original), Freeman can do more with a fleeting look than others can do with a whole paragraph of speech. There is a lunatic moment in Episode 2 (The Sign of Three) where, for no obvious reason, he calls Sherlock ""mate"". In the barely perceptible pause that follows, the merest flash of facial expression succeeds brilliantly in conveying his astonishment at himself for having used such a blokey form of address. It happens so fast that the inattentive viewer could easily miss it, but for me it was the funniest moment in an episode that contained a lot of funny moments. More than that, it reinforces the feeling I've always had that Freeman does not play Watson; Freeman *is* Watson. He is thinking and feeling everything that Watson is thinking and feeling, no acting required. A master-class.Una Stubbs as Mrs Hudson - often described in her native land as a ""national treasure"", which undervalues her. In my view, she's precious enough to deserve her own vault in the Bank of England with guards at the door 24/7. Older viewers will remember her in Worzel Gummidge playing opposite Jon Pertwee as Aunt Sally. (I mean she, not Jon Pertwee, was Aunt Sally.) Viewers even older than that will remember her as Rita in Till Death Us Do Part (US remake: All in the Family). Mrs Hudson, the good-hearted chatterbox, is not an easy part to play without becoming tiresome, but Stubbs hits exactly the right tone and is an essential ingredient in at least two great comic scenes.Look out for:Lars Mikkelson as Charles Augustus Magnussen, who promises to be the new Moriarty. I say ""look out for"", because so far we've seen only his eyes, which might or might not be a conscious echo of the eyes-only view we had of the new Doctor (Peter Capaldi) in The Day of the Doctor. Undoubtedly cast on the strength of his impressive performance in the Danish series, Forbrydelsen (The Killing), he might be a sign of a change in mood. Up to now the present season has tended more towards the comic and self-referential. Mikkelsen's appearance might be the moment when the new season turns serious.Speculate about:Mary Morstan, as played by Martin Freeman's real-life partner, Amanda Abbington. In Episode 2 she marries Watson, and Sherlock is best man. However, in the previous episode Sherlock had subjected her to his usual scrutiny at their first encounter, generating a screenful of the aforementioned word-jumbles: ""linguist"", ""nurse"", ""short-sighted"", ""cat-lover"", ""bakes own bread"", and several others. One that could easily be missed is ""liar"". Was that thrown in on a whim, or is it a time-bomb? Hmmm......That's my review. What follows below is something I posted back in September, when Amazon was offering the DVDs for Season 3 on pre-order. Which was absurdly premature, since not only had the season not been screened yet, it hadn't even been shot. We were being invited to review discs for a non-existent show. So, predictably, a lot of people took up the challenge. I couldn't resist making my own contribution, in the form of a Victorian fantasy. I should probably delete it now, since it's lost its topicality, but people seemed to like it, so I'll leave it be.*************************(Scene: 221b Baker St, London NW1. Date: April 1st, 1895)WATSON: Pray, Holmes, instead of puffing on that ridiculously large pipe and staring moodily out of the window, apprise me of the solution to the Case of the Missing Moving-Picture Show.HOLMES:  I'm cogitating, Watson.WATSON: Indeed? Well, let us hope Mrs Hudson doesn't enter unexpectedly.HOLMES:  You are very droll.WATSON: I confess, Holmes, that I grow vexed at your obfuscation. You speak mysteriously of products that are for sale, yet do not exist; which can be rated and ranked and judged for quality by their customers, yet the warehouses that supposedly store them are empty. You can buy them, but cannot hold them in your hands. You speak of dogs that didn't bark in the night, of cars that didn't park in the night, and ghosts that didn't give me a fright, but still I know no more than I did at the start.HOLMES:  Very well. I see that I have been remiss in not furnishing you with the fruits of my mental labours. Consider, Watson: once you have eliminated the absurd, whatever remains, however ludicrous, must be the total minus the former.WATSON: That's the latter.HOLMES: You have it precisely.WATSON: And what is it, in a nutshell?HOLMES: It's a nut, Watson, as any book on botany will reveal.WATSON: I mean, what is your conclusion in this case.HOLMES: Ah. My conclusion is that we have been conspired against by men from the future.WATSON: Good Lord! Is that possible?HOLMES: I am forced to deduce it from the evidence. Outside we hear the reassuring clip-clop of horses and the rattle of carriages, but these men, inhabiting this same street, hear the sound of machines flying overhead.WATSON: Holmes, you never cease to astonish me. But what of this conspiracy?HOLMES: Seemingly it is the doing of an inter-galactic time-traveller, who I am led to believe is a sinister Chinaman called Doctor Hu. This cosmic mischief-maker hurtles across the centuries in a stolen police-box, accompanied only by a succession of ""companions"", who I understand to be attractive young women who run a lot. By his agency, we -- that's you and I, Watson -- have been constrained to have our lives re-lived in some future century. And these have been recorded as images on a kinematograph, and compressed, if you can believe it, onto a single spinning disc.WATSON: You mean, like a gramophone record?HOLMES: Just so, except smaller and much more difficult to get out of its case without bending it.WATSON: Remarkable. And they have recorded our expeditions and peregrinations?HOLMES: That is my conclusion. We two, and Mrs Hudson besides, have been mimicked and made a mockery of by skilled impersonators with preposterous names, like.... Cumberdick Bendersquatch, or some such thing. He, it seems, is my alter ego, while yours is colloquially known as ""Tim from the office"". I am unable to ascertain what office that might be, and can only surmise that he's a renegade government clerk fallen on hard times.WATSON: But why us, Holmes? What use can be made of our lives by these ruffians from another century?HOLMES:  Aha. Well, I have since delved further. And, as I suspected, there is second criminal mind at work, one that keeps to the shadows and dark places while he concocts his fiendish plots. You see, Watson, Doctor Hu is but the visible face, while the brain belongs to another.WATSON: Good Lord, Holmes, is there no end to the ingenuity of those who would bring us down? Does this mastermind have a name?HOLMES:  He does, yet I can hardly bring myself to utter it.WATSON: You don't mean--?HOLMES:  My nemesis? The one man of whom I fear I will never be rid? I wish it were not so. Yet I must conclude that it is.WATSON: Moffiarty!HOLMES:  Exactly so, Watson. The only begetter of this devilish scheme is indeed Professor Moffiarty. And Doctor Hu is Moffiarty's creature and does his bidding in all things.WATSON: Holmes, I shudder to think that your nemesis assaults us yet again! What mischief has this demon conjured up in that future time?HOLMES:  Killing, mostly. He is notorious as a killer and a destroyer of dreams. On a mere whim he has killed several of Doctor Hu's running ""companions"", some of them more than once, and left a trail of weeping women around the world who have followed the Doctor's adventures on the kinematograph. At any hour of the day or night their despairing wail can be heard: ""Moffiarty!! Nooooooooo!!...crying now.""WATSON: Then, at the very least he deserves a straight left to the chin, for I abhor the maltreatment of the gentler sex. What a bounder!HOLMES:  Hush, Watson. I fancy the game is not yet afoot, still less ayard or amile. Let us ask ourselves the following questions....[The rest of Dr Watson's journal is missing, believed lost forever, though it is still on sale at a reasonable price and can be reviewed by anyone who

Sharp,"[0, 1]","I had to over-come a personal hurdle to appreciate the metamorphosis of Sherlock Holmes from his very Victorian persona into a modern sleuth who can say ""Piss off!"" and  remain highly erudite in a way that tech savvy youth can appreciate. Gone  is Conan Doyle's precise visual creation for Holmes as being excessively lean with a hawk nose and piercing grey eyes. Sydney Paget who created the drawings of Holmes for the stories that were originally published as a series in ""The Strand Magazine"" set the image of Holmes in concrete for the next hundred years. The human inspiration for Holmes according to Conan Doyle was Joseph Bell, an Edinburgh professor of medicine who was able to tell what diseases his patients had by watching them walk into the room.Hundreds of thousands of theatrical performances have been built around the world's most portrayed  literary figure of all time and hundreds of actors have played Sherlock and Watson. Holmes will simply not go away even though bumped off by Conan Doyle himself as well as the ""Sherlock"" writers.Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss created the sensationally popular television series ""Sherlock"" and moved the great detective and Watson and all the famous characters Conan Doyle so marvelously integrated into Victorian history away from the Victorian fogs and dropped  them bodily into the twenty-first century.Benedict Cumberbatch is the  young actor who portrays Holmes in  the""Sherlock""series. He has an unusual face, the eyes deeply set, the lips finely etched. The nose is somewhat tilted up, not the slightest bit aquiline. Like the original sleuth he is  lean and tall and energetic and describes himself as ""focused like a shark."" His nervous energy is almost palpable.Eerily, the modern Doctor Watson played by Martin Freeman is wounded in Afghanistan during the same war that has been tearing the country apart for a century. Freeman's Watson is a pleasant looking man, reliable and trustworthy and supporter of his roommate Sherlock. Although Watson as famously portrayed by Nigel Bruce is a loveable buffoon, the original Watson was steady, sober, honest, the type of man who was the backbone of the British nation. The Watson of ""Sherlock"" as Holmes' confidante  and sounding board has ""an outrageous sense of entitlement."" Returning from military service in Afghanistan, however, Watson is suffering from post traumatic stress disorder and Holmes gets him to write a blog as therapy. Holmes and Watson are the co-lead. Without Watson you have no Holmes.""Unlocking Sherlock"" discusses all the familiar roles in their new environment- Inspector Lestrade, Irene Adler, Professor Moriarty and even Mrs. Hudson all are modernized and their transformations explained. The documentary will greatly enhance your experience when watching ""Sherlock.""And it's a comforting thought that Holmes and Watson and all the Conan Doyle characters are alive and well.",5,Will the real Sherlock Holmes please stand up?,1398038400,"04 21, 2014",2014,2912,"['had', 'over-come', 'personal', 'hurdle', 'appreciate', 'metamorphosis', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'very', 'Victorian', 'persona', 'modern', 'sleuth', 'who', 'can', 'say', 'Piss', 'off', 'remain', 'highly', 'erudite', 'way', 'tech', 'savvy', 'youth', 'can', 'appreciate', 'Gone', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'precise', 'visual', 'creation', 'Holmes', 'being', 'excessively', 'lean', 'hawk', 'nose', 'piercing', 'grey', 'eyes', 'Sydney', 'Paget', 'who', 'created', 'drawings', 'Holmes', 'stories', 'were', 'originally', 'published', 'series', 'Strand', 'Magazine', 'set', 'image', 'Holmes', 'concrete', 'next', 'hundred', 'years', 'human', 'inspiration', 'Holmes', 'according', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'was', 'Joseph', 'Bell', 'Edinburgh', 'professor', 'medicine', 'who', 'was', 'able', 'tell', 'what', 'patients', 'had', 'watching', 'walk', 'room.Hundreds', 'thousands', 'theatrical', 'performances', 'have', 'been', 'built', 'world', 'most', 'portrayed', 'literary', 'figure', 'time', 'hundreds', 'actors', 'have', 'played', 'Sherlock', 'Watson', 'Holmes', 'will', 'simply', 'not', 'go', 'away', 'even', 'bumped', 'off', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'as', 'well', 'Sherlock', 'writers.Steven', 'Moffat', 'Mark', 'Gatiss', 'created', 'sensationally', 'popular', 'television', 'series', 'Sherlock', 'moved', 'great', 'detective', 'Watson', 'famous', 'characters', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'so', 'marvelously', 'integrated', 'Victorian', 'history', 'away', 'Victorian', 'fogs', 'dropped', 'bodily', 'twenty-first', 'century.Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'young', 'actor', 'who', 'Holmes', 'Sherlock', 'series', 'unusual', 'face', 'eyes', 'deeply', 'set', 'lips', 'finely', 'etched', 'nose', 'somewhat', 'tilted', 'up', 'not', 'slightest', 'bit', 'aquiline', 'original', 'sleuth', 'lean', 'tall', 'energetic', 'focused', 'shark', 'nervous', 'energy', 'almost', 'palpable.Eerily', 'modern', 'Doctor', 'Watson', 'played', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'wounded', 'Afghanistan', 'same', 'war', 'been', 'tearing', 'country', 'apart', 'century', 'Freeman', 'Watson', 'pleasant', 'looking', 'man', 'reliable', 'trustworthy', 'supporter', 'roommate', 'Sherlock', 'Watson', 'famously', 'portrayed', 'Nigel', 'Bruce', 'loveable', 'buffoon', 'original', 'Watson', 'was', 'steady', 'sober', 'honest', 'type', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'backbone', 'British', 'nation', 'Watson', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'confidante', 'sounding', 'board', 'outrageous', 'sense', 'entitlement', 'Returning', 'military', 'service', 'Afghanistan', 'however', 'Watson', 'suffering', 'post', 'traumatic', 'stress', 'disorder', 'Holmes', 'write', 'blog', 'therapy', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'are', 'co-lead', 'Watson', 'have', 'Holmes', 'Unlocking', 'Sherlock', 'familiar', 'roles', 'new', 'environment-', 'Inspector', 'Lestrade', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'Professor', 'Moriarty', 'even', 'Mrs.', 'Hudson', 'are', 'modernized', 'transformations', 'explained', 'documentary', 'will', 'greatly', 'enhance', 'experience', 'when', 'watching', 'Sherlock', 'comforting', 'thought', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'characters', 'are', 'alive', 'well']",N/A

Herman,"[4, 8]","I am not a Sherlockian, but I have read and re-read the original stories and listened to audiobook versions and also read a biography of ACD, so I am a fan. I like Benedict better than any of the other Sherlocks, including the guy on Elementary and Downey Jr. I like MOST of the new Sherlocks episodes, and I liked MOST of the wedding episode ( spoiler alert: although I am supposed to believe that two men are stabbed with thin blades in the back and don't realize it!!!! ) This one fact spoils the entire episode for me. Now, on to the finale, about the blackmailer Gustafson. I remember the original story fondly. And I don't mind that the plot is changed. Arthur Conan Doyle was not perfect, and his stories sometimes were just stupid. But they are creative, and well written. What I don't like and don't see any need to do is to take bits and pieces of the original stories and hodge-podge them together as a sort of homage pie. I was reading &#34;The Man With The Twisted Lip &#34;when I watched the Sherlock finale. So I knew that the crack house scene is taken from that opium den scene; with the twist that Watson went there to vent his pent up anger ( not at all the Watson that I prefer ). I was content with Watson being passive and sensitive and married to a real normal nice woman. I should have noticed that when Sherlock had a girlfriend ( spoiler alert: she is not really his girlfriend, he is using her to get into Gustafson's house ) I should have remembered that the idea comes directly from ACD's original story, but I was enjoying the scene too much. After all this build-up and a nice creepy character villain, I was hoping for a bit of the old detective work, some meaty mystery for Sherlock to solve. NO SUCH LUCK !!! The finale episode goes right off the deep end into ridiculousness and spoils everything for me. ( Spoiler alert again: Mary, who I was very happy with, suddenly has a dark past as an assassin, of all the stupid things; and then she shoots Sherlock for no good reason, honestly... no good reason. You can try to twist the plot around all you want, but she shoots him for no good reason ) After this bad decision on the writer's parts, the episode falls apart. We have to watch a very long description of Sherlock figuring out how not to die. And then even though he is shot in the chest, near his heart, he is out and about pretty quickly, wincing whenever he moves. This is the cheapest of plot devices and has ruined many a great character ( like Prendergast, by Preston and Child, who was never interesting after getting shot in the chest ) . I was still hoping that even a damaged Sherlock would now get on with sleuthing, but NO. ( Spoiler alert again: Sherlock shoots Gustafson, who everyone wanted dead; and then Sherlock is sent away as punishment... SO MELODRAMATIC!!!!! ). It just does not make sense, and now Mary is not interesting. Anyway, the ending is even worse. Moriarty is not even dead. I guess nobody dies in this Sherlock universe.

The writing was uneven, with illogical and stupid behavior exhibited by major characters practically punching me in the face.  The cinematography was different as well, although not worse; the sound however suffered and dialogue was muffled in spots.  Extras on the blu-ray were a bit thin compared to the other seasons.  None of the episodes were provided commentary by the cast and crew.  The addition of the Christmas clip, Many Happy Returns, would have been nice.The season's criminal mastermind was Charles Augustus Magnussen who, unlike Moriarty's insidious presence in Seasons 1 and 2, got major play only in the final episode.  He was appropriately sleazy and slimy, and I'll just leave his treatment by the show at that.  Family matters and relationships were the season's predominant arc, not brain-teasers.  The mysteries were...dull.  Numerous characters' back-stories were provided instead and there was some character development.  I'll even admit to being interested in knowing more about the Sherlock family.  In small doses.  However, not a few motivations and actions strained believability, and some completely destroyed it.The episodes - so many winks and nods to the fandom, or a niche of the fandom, it was as if the 4th wall wasn't even built first to be subsequently broken.  You whip off that scarf, Sherlock!  Brag about the number of (admittedly fabulous) coats, collar turned up of course, that you have.  There is shirtless Sherlock, bloody shirtless Sherlock.  Sherlock in shackles and Holmes with handcuffs.  Even a slash!Sherlock pops up, as does Liplock Sherlock (and I may have muttered &#34;You lucky b!tch&#34; at the screen.  More than once).  Surely there were enough gif-able scenes to last at least 10 years.  The actors made the episodes watchable, even enjoyable at times, but I pray the writers got all of the giggles out of their system.I hope that the last scene in the finale indicates a return to the sparkling fast-paced wit and story lines which made most of Seasons 1 and 2 so watchable.

But people have to realize that times change, and so does Sherlock. While I was never a fan of the books, I can still say that in the books, Sherlock eventually stops becoming such a psychopath and learns to start trusting people more, and something along those lines happens in the new season of Sherlock. So it was natural and bound to happen in the latest Sherlock movie trilogy that he changes. And so does the show, in a few areas.For one, Sherlock is sharper than ever. He may be less sociopathic, but he can think better as a result. His mind-palace is more accessible to him. He can now draw conclusions quicker- a good example being in &#34;His Last Vow&#34;, when he gets shot in the chest. Notice how he manages to deduce in three seconds whether he should fall forward or backward? Or in &#34;The Sign of Three&#34;, when he manages to figure out that the threat from these flunked cases is in the room- and so is the victim, as he delivers his speech. He becomes a much better person, now that he has people on his side. And John Watson is put into good focus too- in fact, his relationships with the people around him is studied in depth, and it's really interesting EPSECIALLY to see how things appear through his eyes.That's what's always kept me drawn to this show- how it's focused primarily on characters. This is something that Steven Moffat has been known to do in everything he tackles, and here it's heavier on character development, in addition to lending a more human side to the sleuth. That's something that he has been doing with Doctor Who recently- for the better, I must add. And it works for Sherlock too. Sherlock, for ages has been far from the superhero role model that most media forms depict him to be- in the books, he was a suicidal, drug-addicted jerk, and minus the drug addictions, Moffat's incarnation of the sleuth depicts this dark side of him perfectly.And that may be why season 3 was my favourite season yet. I impatiently kept hitting &#34;reload&#34; on the torrent networks every week to get the new episode while it aired in the UK and it didn't disappoint in the least. It is unusually faster paced, but that works better for the show. It's clever, it's taut, it's thrilling, there's new twists every minute. Everything you love about Sherlock is handled differently here, for the better. Moffat, I salute you.By the way, one last note. If you're watching this on PBS, stop what you're doing, and seek out torrents of the UK BBC One airings- the PBS airings are edited. Do be careful what torrent you download of His Last Vow too- on some files, the after credits scene is replaced with a trailer for The Musketeers.",5,"A brilliant season that people keep letting their ridiculously high hopes ruin for them, and unjustifiably so",1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,2949,"['Expectation', 'indeed', 'flighty', 'creature', 'natural', 'people', 'have', 'certain', 'expectations', 'Sherlock', 'two', 'years', 'away', 'limelight', 'Steven', 'Moffat', 'major', 'changes', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'such', 'fiftieth', 'response', 'wave', 'goodbye', 'Doctor', 'people', 'have', 'realize', 'times', 'change', 'so', 'Sherlock', 'was', 'never', 'fan', 'books', 'can', 'still', 'say', 'books', 'Sherlock', 'eventually', 'becoming', 'psychopath', 'start', 'trusting', 'people', 'more', 'something', 'lines', 'happens', 'new', 'season', 'Sherlock', 'was', 'natural', 'bound', 'happen', 'latest', 'Sherlock', 'movie', 'trilogy', 'so', 'show', 'few', 'areas.For', 'one', 'Sherlock', 'sharper', 'ever', 'may', 'be', 'less', 'sociopathic', 'can', 'think', 'better', 'result', 'mind-palace', 'more', 'accessible', 'can', 'now', 'draw', 'conclusions', 'quicker-', 'good', 'example', 'being', '34', 'Last', 'Vow', '34', 'when', 'shot', 'chest', 'Notice', 'how', 'deduce', 'three', 'seconds', 'should', 'fall', 'forward', 'backward', 'Or', '34', 'Sign', 'Three', '34', 'when', 'figure', 'out', 'threat', 'flunked', 'cases', 'room-', 'so', 'victim', 'speech', 'much', 'better', 'person', 'now', 'people', 'side', 'John', 'Watson', 'put', 'good', 'focus', 'too-', 'fact', 'relationships', 'people', 'studied', 'depth', 'really', 'interesting', 'EPSECIALLY', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'appear', 'eyes.That', 'what', 'always', 'kept', 'drawn', 'show-', 'how', 'focused', 'primarily', 'characters', 'something', 'Steven', 'Moffat', 'been', 'known', 'do', 'everything', 'here', 'heavier', 'character', 'development', 'addition', 'lending', 'more', 'human', 'side', 'sleuth', 'something', 'been', 'doing', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'recently-', 'better', 'must', 'add', 'Sherlock', 'too', 'Sherlock', 'ages', 'been', 'far', 'superhero', 'role', 'model', 'most', 'media', 'forms', 'depict', 'be-', 'books', 'was', 'suicidal', 'drug-addicted', 'jerk', 'drug', 'addictions', 'Moffat', 'incarnation', 'sleuth', 'dark', 'side', 'perfectly.And', 'may', 'be', 'why', 'season', '3', 'was', 'favourite', 'season', 'yet', 'impatiently', 'kept', 'hitting', '34', 'reload', '34', 'torrent', 'networks', 'week', 'get', 'new', 'episode', 'aired', 'UK', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'least', 'unusually', 'faster', 'paced', 'better', 'show', 'clever', 'taut', 'thrilling', 'new', 'twists', 'minute', 'Everything', 'love', 'Sherlock', 'handled', 'differently', 'here', 'better', 'Moffat', 'salute', 'way', 'one', 'last', 'note', ""'re"", 'watching', 'PBS', 'stop', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'seek', 'out', 'torrents', 'UK', 'BBC', 'One', 'airings-', 'PBS', 'airings', 'are', 'edited', 'Do', 'be', 'careful', 'what', 'torrent', 'download', 'Last', 'Vow', 'too-', 'files', 'credits', 'scene', 'replaced', 'trailer', 'Musketeers']",N/A

1664250,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B00E3UN44W,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[5, 7]","As I post this review there are already 476 reviews on Amazon (even though the David and BD were just released). This is because Amazon has a ;policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats (Broadcast TV, Amazon Instant, David and BD) together and lists on every format. So I always advise folks to sort by Newest First and then look to see which format the review is covering. Also, As someone has already pointed out, the show which aired on PBS in the US is the EDITED edition, not the original UK one.With that said, this is review of the BD. If you are coming to this review under Series (Season) 3, then you have probably seen Seasons 1 and 2 already. (If not, go back to the beginning).  At the end of Season 2 the title character &#8220;dies&#8221;. It&#8217;s not really a &#8220;spoiler&#8221; to say that he didn&#8217;t &#8211; because &#8211; otherwise there would be no Sherlock 3. But I won&#8217;t reveal why he didn&#8217;t die. In fact that is the main reason for the first of the 3 (approx.) 90-minute episodes in this third season.  I will admit that since it was at least six months since I watched Season 2,  it took a little while to &#8220;catch up&#8221; as the first episode of Season 3 doesn&#8217;t really replay much of the last seasons&#8217; ending.In the bonuses that I&#8217;ll mention in a minute (or less) one of the co-writers says that&#8221; the show is NOT a detective story; it is, rather, a story about a detective&#8221;. This is important because much of the four hours is about the relationship between Sherlock and Watson and a woman. (I told you, no spoilers!). I felt the second of the three episodes dragged more than any other in the series &#8211; but that is a subjective opinion. The show is still technically brilliant and the cast is perfect.  There is a new villain introduced in the &#8220;story arc&#8221; and, of course there is a &#8220;cliff hanger&#8221; at the end of episode 3 because there will be a Season 4.The BD, of course, looks great and has the same Bonus Features as the David. There are three &#8220;featurettes&#8221;, each  running about 15 minutes &#8211; each featuring insightful interview segments with the cast members and the production crew:&#8220;The Fall&#8221; &#8211; which dissects the finale from  Season 2 and discusses how it was filmed.Fame, Villains and Speculation &#8211; Shows rehearsals, discussion of the script and all the new fans of the show&#8220;Shooting Sherlock&#8221; covers the technical tricks used in the season&#8217;s episodes. You&#8217;ll find that very little CGI effects were used. A lot of specially-designed props were devised.Since the Instant Video versions do not (to my knowledge) include the 45-minutes of bonuses, I do recommend that real fans go for the Physical disc versions. And if you saw it on PBS and some scenes seemed unfulfilled, then knowing they were edited may help explain that.  The BBC Home Video version is the original shown on the BBC.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm&#8220;Anything Phonographic&#8221;",5,Bluray review &#8211; NO SPOILERS! &#8211; includes details of Bonus materials,1392163200,"02 12, 2014",2014,3078,"['post', 'review', 'are', 'already', '476', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'even', 'David', 'BD', 'were', 'just', 'released', 'Amazon', 'policy', 'grouping', 'ALL', 'reviews', 'ALL', 'formats', 'Broadcast', 'TV', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'David', 'BD', 'together', 'lists', 'format', 'always', 'advise', 'folks', 'sort', 'Newest', 'First', 'then', 'look', 'see', 'format', 'review', 'covering', 'Also', 'someone', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'show', 'aired', 'PBS', 'US', 'EDITED', 'edition', 'not', 'original', 'UK', 'one.With', 'said', 'review', 'BD', 'are', 'coming', 'review', 'Series', 'Season', '3', 'then', 'have', 'probably', 'seen', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'already', 'not', 'go', 'back', 'beginning', 'end', 'Season', '2', 'title', 'character', '8220', '8221', '8217', 'not', 'really', '8220', '8221', 'say', '8217', '8211', '8211', 'otherwise', 'would', 'be', 'Sherlock', '3', 'won', '8217', 'reveal', 'why', '8217', 'die', 'fact', 'main', 'reason', 'first', '3', 'approx', '90-minute', 'episodes', 'third', 'season', 'will', 'admit', 'was', 'least', 'six', 'months', 'watched', 'Season', '2', 'took', 'little', '8220', 'catch', 'up', '8221', 'first', 'episode', 'Season', '3', 'doesn', '8217', 'really', 'replay', 'much', 'last', 'seasons', '8217', 'bonuses', '8217', 'mention', 'minute', 'less', 'one', 'co-writers', '8221', 'show', 'NOT', 'detective', 'story', 'rather', 'story', 'detective', '8221', 'important', 'much', 'four', 'hours', 'relationship', 'Sherlock', 'Watson', 'woman', 'told', 'spoilers', 'felt', 'second', 'three', 'episodes', 'dragged', 'more', 'other', 'series', '8211', 'subjective', 'opinion', 'show', 'still', 'technically', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'perfect', 'new', 'villain', 'introduced', '8220', 'story', 'arc', '8221', 'course', '8220', 'cliff', 'hanger', '8221', 'end', 'episode', '3', 'will', 'be', 'Season', '4.The', 'BD', 'course', 'great', 'same', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'David', 'are', 'three', '8220', '8221', 'running', 'about', '15', 'minutes', '8211', 'featuring', 'insightful', 'interview', 'segments', 'cast', 'members', 'production', 'crew', '8220', 'Fall', '8221', '8211', 'finale', 'Season', '2', 'how', 'was', 'filmed.Fame', 'Villains', 'Speculation', '8211', 'Shows', 'rehearsals', 'discussion', 'script', 'new', 'fans', 'show', '8220', 'Shooting', 'Sherlock', '8221', 'technical', 'tricks', 'used', 'season', '8217', 's', 'episodes', '8217', 'find', 'very', 'little', 'CGI', 'effects', 'were', 'used', 'lot', 'specially-designed', 'props', 'were', 'devised.Since', 'Instant', 'Video', 'versions', 'do', 'not', 'knowledge', 'include', '45-minutes', 'bonuses', 'do', 'recommend', 'real', 'fans', 'go', 'Physical', 'disc', 'versions', 'saw', 'PBS', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'unfulfilled', 'then', 'knowing', 'were', 'edited', 'may', 'help', 'explain', 'BBC', 'Home', 'Video', 'version', 'original', 'shown', 'BBC.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', '8220', 'Anything', 'Phonographic', '8221']",N/A

Thank God for the BBC, which is providing some pretty great programming these days.Benedict Cumberbatch is quickly becoming a household name in America, with good reason.  This young actor has an amazing ability to convey emotions with some of the most deadpan expressions I've ever seen.  His Sherlock is perfection.  Tall and lithe, gorgeous, snide, snobbish and superior.  Martin Freeman, whose everyman style is also just right for the part, gives Dr. Watson the touch of humanity and kindness needed to play opposite Cumberbatch's Sherlock.The first episode of Season Thee deals with the death of Sherlock in Season Two.  Two years have past, and Dr. Watson has finally moved on, his grief subsiding enough to have found love with a kind and sympathetic partner, Mary.  The two are dining out, and Watson is just about to pop the question and ask Mary to marry him, when, like the ghost of Christmas past, Sherlock appears, hovering over him disguised as a waiter at the restaurant the couple are dining in.  Watson is properly gobsmacked, angry, relieved, outraged, thrilled.  The two find themselves quickly embroiled in a new mystery involving the potential bombing of Buckingham Palace. The typical fun ensues, and so fun is it to watch these two that it almost hurts.  Where is this programming in America (although The Following and The Blacklist are pretty darn close).I can't recommend the purchase of this episode more highly.  I actually bought the whole season after I'd already paid for this episode and I'd do it again.  Unfortunately I have very little self control and binge watched the whole thing as soon as I bought the Season (same thing with Downton Abbey and Orange is the New Black...I need to get some help).  If you haven't experienced Sherlock, then go back to Season One and start from the beginning.  It's worth it, I promise.  If you are trying to decide on the purchase of this episode, all I can say is buy it.  Trust me....just go ahead and buy it.  I envy you because you get to experience Sherlock, and I've watched the whole Season already.  Sit back, grab some popcorn and prepare to be properly wowed by Sherlock.

There were so many fan theories and speculation amidst the fan art, fanvids, and fanfiction from people who absolutely have adored the show for all of these years with their favorite pairings and characters that it begged the question from so many: how could Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss (with occasional collaborator Stephen Thompson) pull off the impossible, in a sense, and set up the perfect trick by which Sherlock survived?But the answer, which came two years or so after season 2, is quite unexpected in that it doesn't really matter. Nothing that Sherlock and the writers could come up with would match the drama and problem of the Fall. It matters that Sherlock survived, but it doesn't matter how he survived, and that is brilliant in quite a few ways. They present the problem and several solutions to it as there is no final problem and no final solution to Sherlock's Fall. He will survive the Fall, for that is part of Sherlock's mythos and mystique, and important to who he is. Reichenbach Falls is the point where Sherlock turned around and changed from being a famous detective that everyone loved into a legend in his own right.Season 3 itself is a response and an answer to so many of the fans' wishes over the years in that the creators of the show are aware of the enormous popularity that Sherlock has garnered in its first two seasons, and they give the fans what they want in a sense, although not every wish is granted, which is probably for the best. Sherlock himself changes. He seems more personal and more approachable than he had been before. The last two years have changed him in many ways as he was forced to flee deep undercover, probably to the darkest regions of the world, and might have grown to miss everything that he had left behind him. Of course, he is still a high-level functioning sociopath, and doesn't let us forget it. (It had been noticed by a fan in the early 1900s, speaking to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, that Sherlock wasn't the same since he came back from Reichenbach Falls. Here, that historical, canonical change is acknowledged and developed upon.)Mycroft and Sherlock are more familiar with each other than they have been in the past, and we even meet...well, oh, boy, that was a surprise. As for Watson, he grew a mustache in his grief for Sherlock and immediately punches him when he returns from the dead, but Mary, Watson's fianc&eacute;e and then wife (They get married in The Sign of Three) becomes companionable with Sherlock and smoothes the way between them, although it is a very rough road.

A lot of people didn't care for how the show was more personal and character driven, as opposed to the last two series which focused on the cases.After finally watching all three episodes (and also some fantastic extra featurettes) I can safely say this was a fantastic season of Sherlock. I think the move to character driven stories makes perfect sense. Sherlock faked his own death, and as such John Watson learned to move on and found love.When you have episodes that deal with death (or not!) and marriage, obviously some character development is necessary to move the plot forward, and Sherlock did this perfectly in my opinion. There were still plenty of mysteries and cases to solve, but I was thrilled with the way Sherlock realized how his faked death affected his best friend. Additionally I loved watching Sherlock and Mr. and Mrs. Watson come to terms with their relationship and how it would work out together. After seven episodes you finally see how important John is to Sherlock.After the two character focused episodes in The Empty Hearse and The Sign of Three we were given an outstanding episode and villian in His Last Vow.

1664282,A3JLOIXFM75QNV,B00E3UN44W,"Valerya Couto ""LOTRsherlockHPFreak""","[4, 8]","Two years. Two years of obsessing, and patiently (and sometimes not) waiting, and hoping and wondering. That's what this series does to people. Why is Sherlock so spectacular? Why has it dramatically increased its viewership and fan base? Well, simple, it's just plain awesome. Oh yea, and Benedict Cumberbatch. But more on him later...Once again we get three 1 1/2 hour episodes, which truly feel like mini films, at that length. Each episode is completely different from each other. Tonally, this entire season is different from the past two, but different doesn't necessarily equal bad/better, it's just contrasting.The Empty Hearse:Episode one gives us the answer to the excruciating question: How did Sherlock service that fall? We do get that answer, albeit in a strange way. It will not satisfy everyone, for a number of reasons. But, that said, it is probably the most plausible explanation we could expect. We also get the inevitable reunion between Sherlock and John. Poor John, who took nearly two years to grieve over Sherlock, who has moved on with a new woman in his life, and who gets the biggest shock of his life all over again. Everyone in the world has envisioned their reunion, and it does not disappoint. Again, it is so much more different than I anticipated, but still thoroughly entertaining. In fact the entire episode is pretty lively and upbeat. We get more Molly, and even more Mycroft who nearly steals the scenes from Sherlock when he's on. We get a bit of a mystery of course, and we also get a new character: Mary. She is a perfect match for John, and you can tell they are over the moon for each other (shouldn't be hard to fake since they are in actuality a real couple). She is actually very charming and in no way comes between Sherlock and John, and in fact encourages John to see more of Sherlock. She's a great addition to the series and really brings her game when on screen with Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch. Sherlock is still sharp, and cutting, derision dripping from his mouth. But we start to see something crumble behind that mask that's been in place for so long. He comes across as almost generous at times, and patient. And then the next scene has us cringing all over again. It's a wonderful dynamic and Cumberbatch is better than ever.The Sign of Three:The big wedding! John is getting married to Mary and of course Sherlock is the best man. To say any more would be to ruin what is easily the funniest episode in the history of Sherlock. Truly, the wit, and utter silliness that this episode produces will merit constant repeats. It also features what is probably the longest Best Man speech in history. It's clever with the interplaying flashbacks and we get an in depth look into how Sherlock's mind actually works. We also get Sherlock and John doing...things. Truly, best not to be spoiled.  While it is John's big day, this episode belongs entirely to Sherlock and once again to Cumberbatch. Here we truly see a magnificent actor at work. He is probably in every single page in the script and has his work cut out for him. And he is. Flawless. Funny, and clever and annoying and surprising. I have to say that while I constantly praise Cumberbatch, Martin Freeman is spot on and perfect as Watson. He contrasts Sherlock so well, that I cannot see another person in his role. He is on his game 100% of the time, and I KNOW this series would not be what it is without him in that role. These two characters really compliment each other and it's this dynamic that keeps people coming back for more. And this episode really showcases that. And there's even a mystery for him to solve at John's wedding. We get a little bit of everything. And then we get a glimpse of melancholy at the end. Which brings us to the third and last part.His Last Vow:Where as The Sign of Three was a riotous affair, His Last Vow is the complete opposite. Gloomy from beginning to end, somber and ghastly, depressing and shocking. This is by far the darkest episode we have seen. We encounter Sherlock in a new light. It is a new low for the detective, right from the beginning, and things do not improve in the slightest. We also meet a new villain, Charles Magnussen, played to freakishly perfection by Lars Mikkelsen (Mad's Brother). He is vile, beyond repulsive in every way imaginable, has a dark secret and is the one man Sherlock truly despises. Where Moriarty was psychotic, yet playful, Magnussen is just plain evil. It's chilling to watch him on screen. This episode is full of twists. Dark, surprising, heart-breaking twists. And oh yes, a gorgeous, pulse-racing, brutal twenty minute sequence featuring some of the best acting from Cumberbatch I've seen in all of Sherlock. If people were, for some dull reason disappointed by the first two episodes (and I've read plenty of grumbles) then this should not displease anyone and will certainly more than make up for the jovial and frivolous nature of the earlier episodes. The ending is heart-wrenching and so bittersweet. And then there is another ending. Another 'shocker' if you will. I personally, without spoiling anything, do not think it's going where people are thinking it's going. But, like everyone else, I will just have to wait and see.I think the main reason why this series works so well, and attracts so many different people, is because of the creators. Steve Moffat and Mark Gatiss(who not only acts but wrote The Empty Hearse). You can tell they know who their audience is, and they actually LISTEN to them. It's refreshing to see that and how involved they are with their fan base. They, 'get it'. And as long as Sherlock is in their capable hands, I will continue to watch and hope that this series continues for years to come.Edit 1-27-13: I completely forgot to talk about the score! Sherlock season 3 features a fantastic musical score, very reminiscent of season 2, with its dark, dramatic tones, especially in His Last Vow. It really fluctuates from light and airy, the violin once again prevelant and beautiful, to somber and suspenseful. I know it seems like an afterthought to add this, but I really think the music can make or break your viewing experience and the score in Sherlock does not dissapoint.",5,"So different, and still so

How could they turn this series into a soap opera?  Season 3 begins with The Empty Hearse, the conclusion to the Season Two cliff-hanger.  I was disappointed.  While I loved the idea, the execution of the scheme was really pretty ridiculous, like something you would expect in a Disney sitcom.  I expected to see bigger and better things for the death of Moriarty.  This was seriously weak.  Worst of all, many details in the story line were just glossed over.  Get used to it, because in this season the mystery is the least important element in any story.  Solving a mystery should be the best part!  The episode was also difficult to follow because there were so many flashbacks, while the video editing was done by a meth junkie, IMO. The dramatic use of the editing room is another overused artifice fans will find irritating in all the new episodes.  In the end, the first episode raised more questions than it answered.  I found it overwhelmingly unsatisfactory.  I wish I could find something more to like about it.Episode two started out in a very thrilling fashion, with bank robbers foiling Scotland Yard.  But it was all over before the opening credits.  What a wasted opportunity.  It was nothing more than a tease!  The rest of the episode was all about Watson's wedding and the Holmes/Watson bromance.  A fascinating murder mystery was thrown in as an afterthought, covered completely in perhaps ten minutes of this 90 minute episode. They almost didn't bother with such tiresome details like how the crime was actually accomplished.  The producers of the series have gone wildly off track.  Solving a mystery is no longer the central purpose of the story, but merely background to emotional drama.  There really is no longer a reason for a mystery lover to watch the series.  Now if you're wondering whether Sherlock might ever find love...Then watch episode three, which actually starts out to be a real mystery.  But just as you are thanking the producers for including a fascinating episode in the season, it degenerates into a spiral of video outtakes and dream sequences.  I warned you the director had lost it.  Someone should have hidden his stash.  Just as the episode appears to regain its momentum, it loses its way again. There were severe flaws in the logic of the plot, and instead of a mystery we got the dirtbag monologues. There seemed to be no point to the episode at all (unless you count the soap opera drama).  Getting rid of the villain certainly didn't involve any special Sherlock cleverness.  I finally couldn't stand watching it any longer, and just wanted the last 20 minutes to be over.  Honestly, they completely lost me as a fan.  Save your money and hope Season 3 doesn't kill the franchise.",2,Disappointing sequel,1388880000,"01 5, 2014",2014,2829,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'producers', 'excellent', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'made', 'episodes', 'How', 'could', 'turn', 'series', 'soap', 'opera', 'Season', '3', 'begins', 'Empty', 'Hearse', 'conclusion', 'Season', 'Two', 'cliff-hanger', 'was', 'disappointed', 'loved', 'idea', 'execution', 'scheme', 'was', 'really', 'pretty', 'ridiculous', 'something', 'would', 'expect', 'Disney', 'sitcom', 'expected', 'see', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'death', 'Moriarty', 'was', 'seriously', 'weak', 'Worst', 'many', 'details', 'story', 'line', 'were', 'just', 'glossed', 'over', 'Get', 'used', 'season', 'mystery', 'least', 'important', 'element', 'story', 'Solving', 'mystery', 'should', 'be', 'best', 'part', 'episode', 'was', 'also', 'difficult', 'follow', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'flashbacks', 'video', 'editing', 'was', 'done', 'meth', 'junkie', 'IMO', 'dramatic', 'use', 'editing', 'room', 'overused', 'artifice', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'irritating', 'new', 'episodes', 'end', 'first', 'episode', 'raised', 'more', 'questions', 'answered', 'found', 'overwhelmingly', 'unsatisfactory', 'wish', 'could', 'find', 'something', 'more', 'like', 'it.Episode', 'two', 'started', 'out', 'very', 'thrilling', 'fashion', 'bank', 'robbers', 'foiling', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'was', 'opening', 'credits', 'What', 'wasted', 'opportunity', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'tease', 'rest', 'episode', 'was', 'Watson', 'wedding', 'Holmes/Watson', 'bromance', 'fascinating', 'murder', 'mystery', 'was', 'thrown', 'afterthought', 'covered', 'completely', 'perhaps', 'ten', 'minutes', '90', 'minute', 'episode', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'such', 'tiresome', 'details', 'how', 'crime', 'was', 'actually', 'accomplished', 'producers', 'series', 'have', 'gone', 'wildly', 'track', 'Solving', 'mystery', 'no', 'longer', 'central', 'purpose', 'story', 'merely', 'emotional', 'drama', 'really', 'no', 'longer', 'reason', 'mystery', 'lover', 'watch', 'series', 'Now', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'Sherlock', 'might', 'ever', 'find', 'love', 'Then', 'watch', 'episode', 'three', 'actually', 'out', 'be', 'real', 'mystery', 'just', 'are', 'thanking', 'producers', 'including', 'fascinating', 'episode', 'season', 'spiral', 'video', 'outtakes', 'dream', 'sequences', 'warned', 'director', 'had', 'lost', 'Someone', 'should', 'have', 'hidden', 'stash', 'Just', 'episode', 'regain', 'momentum', 'way', 'again', 'were', 'severe', 'flaws', 'logic', 'plot', 'instead', 'mystery', 'got', 'dirtbag', 'monologues', 'seemed', 'be', 'point', 'episode', 'count', 'soap', 'opera', 'drama', 'Getting', 'rid', 'villain', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'involve', 'special', 'Sherlock', 'cleverness', 'finally', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'watching', 'longer', 'just', 'wanted', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'be', 'Honestly', 'completely', 'lost', 'fan', 'Save', 'money', 'hope', 'Season', '3', ""n't"", 'kill', 'franchise']",N/A

1664287,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00E3UN44W,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[1, 2]","For many the third season of ""Sherlock"" was polarizing--season three focused as much on the procedural aspects of solving the crime as on the character development and interaction of Sherlock, Watson, Mary and Mycroft. That unique mixture is also what made the third season so memorable for me--the writers/producers Matt Gatiss and Steve Moffat didn't simply rely on replicating the formula of the two previous seasons but on expanding the characters.SPOILERS:The brief third season consisted of three episodes ""The Empty Hearse"", ""The Sign of the Three"" and ""His Last Vow"". There was also a 7 minute short made entitled (which I haven't seen yet and is not on this set --that I have been able to discover so far)  ""Many Happy Returns"" that focus on Watson and Lestrade trying to move on with their lives after the death of Sherlock from season two. Those who have seen it please post your thoughts on whether it is worth while watching.""The Empty Hearse"" finds Mycroft (Matt Gatiss) going into the field to ""rescue"" Sherlock(Benedict Cumberbatch). Sherlock spent the last two years since his death dismantling Morarity's organization but finds a new challenge when London is threatened by a mysterious terrorist.""The Sign of the Three"" combines Watson's (Martin Freeman)marriage to Mary (Amanda Abbington)and the murder attempt against someone in the wedding party. Sherlock struggles with trying to come up with a great speech as the best man.The third episode ties into the first one and an attempt on someone close to Sherlock. ""His Last Vow"" focuses on Sherlock trying to defeat a powerful man (Lars Mikkelsen)for whom information is both the ultimate leverage and punishment for those he dislikes including John Watson. Sherlock must figure out where his new nemesis hides the information he keeps and formulate a plan to destroy it in order to protect his friends and England.END OF SPOILERS:The third season looks exceptional on Blu-ray (I'm assuming that the DVD also used the same source transfer so should look good as well). Colors pop and fine detail is exceptionall sharp and crisp. The 5.1 lossless sound comes across with quite a bit of power but dialog is never lost in the detailed soundtrack.The special features include a trio of featurettes-- ""The Fall,"" ""Shooting Sherlock,"" and ""Fans, Villains, & Speculation.""  My only complaint with the third season set is that there aren't any commentary tracks from the actors, writers or directors who worked on the show. I'm a fan of commentary tracks and find that they are just as insightful (when done correctly)as featurettes while allowing the person doing the commentary to focus (real time)on events that transpired during shooting.The presentation for ""Sherlock"" remains terrific and the special features present a pretty good peak behind the curtain.Recommended.",5,It isn't due to sheer luck that Sherlock returns and defeats new adversaries in third season,1392163200,"02 12, 2014",2014,2835,"['many', 'third', 'season', 'Sherlock', 'was', 'polarizing', 'season', 'three', 'focused', 'as', 'much', 'procedural', 'aspects', 'solving', 'crime', 'character', 'development', 'interaction', 'Sherlock', 'Watson', 'Mary', 'Mycroft', 'unique', 'mixture', 'also', 'what', 'made', 'third', 'season', 'so', 'memorable', 'writers/producers', 'Matt', 'Gatiss', 'Steve', 'Moffat', 'did', ""n't"", 'simply', 'rely', 'replicating', 'formula', 'two', 'previous', 'seasons', 'expanding', 'characters.SPOILERS', 'brief', 'third', 'season', 'consisted', 'three', 'episodes', 'Empty', 'Hearse', 'Sign', 'Three', 'Last', 'Vow', 'was', 'also', '7', 'minute', 'short', 'made', 'entitled', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'not', 'set', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'discover', 'so', 'far', 'Many', 'Happy', 'Returns', 'focus', 'Watson', 'Lestrade', 'trying', 'move', 'lives', 'death', 'Sherlock', 'season', 'two', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'please', 'post', 'thoughts', 'worth', 'watching', 'Empty', 'Hearse', 'Mycroft', 'Matt', 'Gatiss', 'going', 'field', 'rescue', 'Sherlock', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'Sherlock', 'spent', 'last', 'two', 'years', 'death', 'dismantling', 'Morarity', 'organization', 'new', 'challenge', 'when', 'London', 'threatened', 'mysterious', 'terrorist', 'Sign', 'Three', 'Watson', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'marriage', 'Mary', 'Amanda', 'Abbington', 'murder', 'attempt', 'someone', 'wedding', 'party', 'Sherlock', 'trying', 'come', 'up', 'great', 'speech', 'best', 'man.The', 'third', 'episode', 'ties', 'first', 'one', 'attempt', 'someone', 'close', 'Sherlock', 'Last', 'Vow', 'Sherlock', 'trying', 'defeat', 'powerful', 'man', 'Lars', 'Mikkelsen', 'whom', 'information', 'ultimate', 'leverage', 'punishment', 'including', 'John', 'Watson', 'Sherlock', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'new', 'nemesis', 'information', 'formulate', 'plan', 'destroy', 'order', 'protect', 'friends', 'England.END', 'OF', 'SPOILERS', 'third', 'season', 'exceptional', 'Blu-ray', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'DVD', 'also', 'used', 'same', 'source', 'transfer', 'so', 'should', 'look', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'Colors', 'pop', 'fine', 'detail', 'exceptionall', 'sharp', 'crisp', '5.1', 'lossless', 'sound', 'quite', 'bit', 'power', 'dialog', 'never', 'lost', 'detailed', 'soundtrack.The', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'trio', 'featurettes', 'Fall', 'Shooting', 'Sherlock', 'Fans', 'Villains', 'Speculation', 'only', 'complaint', 'third', 'season', 'set', 'are', ""n't"", 'commentary', 'tracks', 'actors', 'writers', 'directors', 'who', 'worked', 'show', ""'m"", 'fan', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'find', 'are', 'just', 'insightful', 'when', 'done', 'correctly', 'featurettes', 'allowing', 'person', 'doing', 'commentary', 'focus', 'real', 'time', 'events', 'transpired', 'shooting.The', 'presentation', 'Sherlock', 'terrific', 'special', 'features', 'present', 'pretty', 'good', 'peak', 'curtain.Recommended']",N/A

Cumberbatch has hit just the right note to convey Sherlock's self absorbed personality and Martin Freeman has a wonderfully expressive face.  Both men are gifted actors just as capable of making you or cry.

Every episode is interesting, with curious cases, modern mysteries, and intriguing villains.  I particularly love the chemistry between these two British heroes.  Whenever they are together, the best and worst of each comes out it seems.Watching this show is great because you get a bunch of interesting mysteries and an evolving relationship between two very deep individuals.The acting is excellent.  Freeman and Cumberbatch deftly bring these two characters to life.  Never melodramatic.  Never stiff.  You can relate to each of them.Another nice thing about this show is that it is a more &#34;British&#34; series.  Filming is more toned-down, with darker settings, quaint and pleasing British architecture.  Nothing faked.  Nothing too splashy or showy.  The comedy is intelligent and dry.I think the show makers and actors have approached this work with great respect and a drive to achieve authenticity.WATCH IT NOW.",4,Excellent Modern Take on Holmes and Watson,1390089600,"01 19, 2014",2014,1039,"['entire', 'series', 'superb', 'short', 'presentation', 'mad', 'genius', 'Sherlock', 'tough', 'practical', 'Watson', 'Every', 'episode', 'interesting', 'curious', 'cases', 'modern', 'mysteries', 'intriguing', 'villains', 'particularly', 'love', 'chemistry', 'two', 'British', 'heroes', 'are', 'together', 'best', 'worst', 'out', 'seems.Watching', 'show', 'great', 'get', 'bunch', 'interesting', 'mysteries', 'evolving', 'relationship', 'two', 'very', 'deep', 'individuals.The', 'acting', 'excellent', 'Freeman', 'Cumberbatch', 'deftly', 'bring', 'two', 'characters', 'life', 'Never', 'melodramatic', 'Never', 'stiff', 'can', 'relate', 'them.Another', 'nice', 'thing', 'show', 'more', '34', 'British', '34', 'series', 'Filming', 'more', 'toned-down', 'darker', 'settings', 'quaint', 'pleasing', 'British', 'architecture', 'Nothing', 'faked', 'Nothing', 'too', 'splashy', 'showy', 'comedy', 'intelligent', 'dry.I', 'think', 'show', 'makers', 'actors', 'have', 'approached', 'work', 'great', 'respect', 'drive', 'achieve', 'IT', 'NOW']",N/A
