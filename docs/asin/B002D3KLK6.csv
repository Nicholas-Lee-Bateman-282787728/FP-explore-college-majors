A magnificent showcase of British Columbia and its incredible mountains and beautiful music and a narrator, who is almost whispering in awe himself, this presentation took my breath away. Finally I was able to order it and was very excited upon receiving it in just a couple of days of ordering, placed it into my Vizio player and when at last it got started...oh no. The sound which is essential to the production goes in and out like a bad radio station throughout. Not good! So, I thought, maybe the lens on my player needs cleaning so I inserted my cleaning disc and afterwards still no change. Next, I complained to Amazon, who does not sell it, but an outside company. The outside company, which calls themselves a small family business, was quick to respond. I got the replacement this morning, and looking forward to at last watching a decent copy...same thing. Sound was cutting in and out in practically the same places. Even more disappointment gave me the impetus to write this review. While the video portion is all that I expected in showing that glorious scenery the audio, well, just sucks. I am not knocking the distributor, as they are very serious about customer satisfaction. It is the company that makes these ""Over"" videos (TOPICS entertainment) who is ultimately responsible. As of the writing of this review I am wondering if anyone else has run into this problem. I was planning on purchasing other ""Over"" videos but I won't set myself up for any more disappointments at this timesUpdate to this review. I loaned my copy to one of my friends who said the video played flawlessly on his player so now I know that it was my player and not the video that was at fault. Now I need to replace my player. My apologies to the makers of the video TOPICS Entertainment.Another update. I now own a Panasonic blu-ray 3D player and the video plays just fine and it is still gorgeous to watch and listen to as well for the stirring music accompaniment.",5,"Disappointed, but I was wrong.",1351036800,"10 24, 2012",2012,2098,"['first', 'saw', 'video', 'former', 'HDTheater', 'channel', 'knew', 'would', 'have', 'have', 'blu-ray', 'get', 'full', '1080P', 'magnificent', 'showcase', 'British', 'Columbia', 'incredible', 'mountains', 'beautiful', 'music', 'narrator', 'who', 'almost', 'whispering', 'awe', 'presentation', 'took', 'breath', 'away', 'Finally', 'was', 'able', 'order', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'receiving', 'just', 'couple', 'days', 'ordering', 'placed', 'Vizio', 'player', 'when', 'last', 'got', 'started', 'sound', 'essential', 'production', 'bad', 'radio', 'station', 'Not', 'good', 'So', 'thought', 'maybe', 'lens', 'player', 'cleaning', 'so', 'inserted', 'cleaning', 'disc', 'afterwards', 'still', 'change', 'Next', 'complained', 'Amazon', 'who', 'not', 'sell', 'outside', 'company', 'outside', 'company', 'small', 'family', 'business', 'was', 'quick', 'respond', 'got', 'replacement', 'morning', 'looking', 'forward', 'last', 'watching', 'decent', 'copy', 'same', 'thing', 'Sound', 'was', 'cutting', 'practically', 'same', 'places', 'Even', 'more', 'disappointment', 'gave', 'impetus', 'write', 'review', 'video', 'portion', 'expected', 'showing', 'glorious', 'scenery', 'audio', 'well', 'just', 'sucks', 'am', 'not', 'knocking', 'distributor', 'are', 'very', 'serious', 'customer', 'satisfaction', 'company', 'videos', 'TOPICS', 'entertainment', 'who', 'ultimately', 'responsible', 'writing', 'review', 'am', 'wondering', 'anyone', 'else', 'run', 'problem', 'was', 'planning', 'purchasing', 'other', 'videos', 'wo', ""n't"", 'set', 'up', 'more', 'disappointments', 'timesUpdate', 'review', 'loaned', 'copy', 'one', 'friends', 'who', 'said', 'video', 'played', 'flawlessly', 'player', 'so', 'now', 'know', 'was', 'player', 'not', 'video', 'was', 'fault', 'Now', 'need', 'replace', 'player', 'apologies', 'makers', 'video', 'TOPICS', 'Entertainment.Another', 'update', 'now', 'own', 'Panasonic', 'blu-ray', '3D', 'player', 'video', 'just', 'fine', 'still', 'gorgeous', 'watch', 'listen', 'as', 'well', 'stirring', 'music', 'accompaniment']",N/A

1263064,A3AFNPL8179FV3,B002D3KLK6,Shane,"[4, 4]","The scenery and camera work on this film are great! Lots of key points of interest and beautiful scenery. Well shot. The film breaks down a specific area of British Columbia and does about 5 minutes or so on each area, showcasing mostly touristy things while mixing in some beautiful rugged mountains and rivers and other wildlife. The visuals are great. The only issue I had with it was the narration. The narrator really irritated me with his cliches and vague attempt at creating his own 'visuals' with his words. I don't need visuals with words. I'm WATCHING it. The guy also seemed like he was whispering the whole time, another irritation. Why is he whispering? The music went with the images for the most part. The video is about 40 minutes. I would say for some beautiful, inexpensive scenery, this Blu-Ray of British Columbia is great! Worth around $9. Minus one star for the irritating whispering narrator. Other than that guy, would be nice to have on with some of your own music.",4,"Great Scenery, Irritating Whispering Narrator..",1352160000,"11 6, 2012",2012,991,"['scenery', 'camera', 'work', 'film', 'are', 'great', 'Lots', 'key', 'points', 'interest', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'Well', 'shot', 'film', 'breaks', 'down', 'specific', 'area', 'British', 'Columbia', '5', 'minutes', 'so', 'area', 'showcasing', 'mostly', 'touristy', 'things', 'mixing', 'beautiful', 'rugged', 'mountains', 'rivers', 'other', 'wildlife', 'visuals', 'are', 'great', 'only', 'issue', 'had', 'was', 'narration', 'narrator', 'really', 'irritated', 'cliches', 'vague', 'attempt', 'creating', 'own', ""'visuals"", 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'visuals', 'words', ""'m"", 'WATCHING', 'guy', 'also', 'seemed', 'was', 'whispering', 'whole', 'time', 'irritation', 'Why', 'whispering', 'music', 'went', 'images', 'most', 'part', 'video', '40', 'minutes', 'would', 'say', 'beautiful', 'inexpensive', 'scenery', 'Blu-Ray', 'British', 'Columbia', 'great', 'Worth', '9', 'one', 'star', 'irritating', 'whispering', 'narrator', 'Other', 'guy', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'have', 'own', 'music']",N/A
