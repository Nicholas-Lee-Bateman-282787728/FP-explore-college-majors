1299009,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B002Y2QRSG,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 4]","There's nothing like a good disaster movie.  Unfortunately, this isn't one.  In fact, this is without a doubt the most boring disaster movie I have ever seen in my life.  They should have called this Screenwriting Apocalypse or Filmmaking Apocalypse - anything but Meteor Apocalypse.  The title implies that there is actually some sort of apocalypse - there isn't - and at least hints that there will be a bit of excitement involved - there isn't - what with meteorites crashing to Earth and all.Unbeknownst to most of mankind, a huge comet is hurtling to earth.  Anyone can see it's obviously a piece of rock with no trace of ice and not even a hint of a tail - but we're supposed to believe it's a comet, anyway.  All of the nuclear nations of the world get together and launch a barrage of nuclear missiles at the target to try and destroy it.  Unfortunately, all they manage to do is to break the ""comet"" up into hundreds of smaller chunks, all of which begin descending onto Earth.  Aside from the destructive effects of each collision, you also get the contamination of the water supply in the southwestern United States.  People in the affected areas are hauled off into quarantine, including the wife and daughter of our ""hero"" David Dematti (Joe Lando).  His interminably boring quest to find his family makes up the core of this story.  As far as I can tell, David seems to be some sort of water treatment plant employee, yet he has contacts at the CDC (no, the other one - the Center for Disease Containment) and can whip up a cure for the deadly water sickness in less than a minute (of course, he only takes one tiny vial of it with him).  He is also able to cover large areas on foot in short amounts of time, despite having teamed up with a weak and intermittently sick female companion, and has the uncanny ability of locating places he's never been on the first try.  This movie is chock full of enigmas, from the impossible pattern of the meterorites' fall to the fact that none of the strikes kicks up a single bit of dust into the air - but of course the real question is why a movie this bad was ever made.About the only thing this awful movie gets right is the utter incompetence of the Department of Homeland Security, which attempts to thwart any attempt to rescue the sick or dying and can't be bothered to warn the citizens of a large metropolis that their city will be destroyed by a large chunk of the ""comet"" in three days' time.  Apparently, the DHS's only plan is to have no plan at all - and woe to anyone who gets in their way.  Woe also to anyone foolish enough or unlucky enough to watch this abysmal disaster film.  Meteor Apocalypse is the perfect storm of bad writing, bad acting, bad special effects, and bad everything else - I'll bet the filming even had bad catering.",1,The most boring disaster movie ever made,1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,2809,"['nothing', 'good', 'disaster', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'one', 'fact', 'doubt', 'most', 'boring', 'disaster', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'should', 'have', 'called', 'Screenwriting', 'Apocalypse', 'Filmmaking', 'Apocalypse', 'anything', 'Meteor', 'Apocalypse', 'title', 'actually', 'sort', 'apocalypse', ""n't"", 'least', 'hints', 'will', 'be', 'bit', 'excitement', 'involved', ""n't"", 'what', 'meteorites', 'crashing', 'Earth', 'all.Unbeknownst', 'most', 'mankind', 'huge', 'comet', 'hurtling', 'earth', 'Anyone', 'can', 'see', 'obviously', 'piece', 'rock', 'trace', 'ice', 'not', 'even', 'hint', 'tail', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'comet', 'anyway', 'nuclear', 'nations', 'world', 'get', 'together', 'launch', 'barrage', 'nuclear', 'missiles', 'target', 'try', 'destroy', 'Unfortunately', 'manage', 'do', 'break', 'comet', 'up', 'hundreds', 'smaller', 'chunks', 'begin', 'descending', 'Earth', 'Aside', 'destructive', 'effects', 'collision', 'also', 'get', 'contamination', 'water', 'supply', 'southwestern', 'United', 'States', 'People', 'affected', 'areas', 'are', 'hauled', 'off', 'quarantine', 'including', 'wife', 'daughter', 'hero', 'David', 'Dematti', 'Joe', 'Lando', 'interminably', 'boring', 'quest', 'find', 'family', 'up', 'core', 'story', 'As', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'David', 'be', 'sort', 'water', 'treatment', 'plant', 'employee', 'yet', 'contacts', 'CDC', 'other', 'one', 'Center', 'Disease', 'Containment', 'can', 'whip', 'up', 'cure', 'deadly', 'water', 'sickness', 'less', 'minute', 'course', 'only', 'one', 'tiny', 'vial', 'also', 'able', 'cover', 'large', 'areas', 'foot', 'short', 'amounts', 'time', 'having', 'teamed', 'up', 'weak', 'intermittently', 'sick', 'female', 'companion', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'locating', 'places', 'never', 'been', 'first', 'try', 'movie', 'chock', 'full', 'enigmas', 'impossible', 'pattern', 'meterorites', 'fall', 'fact', 'none', 'strikes', 'up', 'single', 'bit', 'dust', 'air', 'course', 'real', 'question', 'why', 'movie', 'bad', 'was', 'ever', 'only', 'thing', 'awful', 'movie', 'right', 'utter', 'incompetence', 'Department', 'Homeland', 'Security', 'thwart', 'attempt', 'rescue', 'sick', 'dying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'warn', 'citizens', 'large', 'metropolis', 'city', 'will', 'be', 'destroyed', 'large', 'chunk', 'comet', 'three', 'days', 'time', 'Apparently', 'DHS', 'only', 'plan', 'have', 'plan', 'woe', 'anyone', 'who', 'way', 'Woe', 'also', 'anyone', 'foolish', 'enough', 'unlucky', 'enough', 'watch', 'abysmal', 'disaster', 'film', 'Meteor', 'Apocalypse', 'perfect', 'storm', 'bad', 'writing', 'bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'bad', 'everything', 'else', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'filming', 'even', 'had', 'bad', 'catering']",N/A
1299010,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B002Y2QRSG,David Bower,"[3, 3]",As a disaster flick fan I have a special tolerance for low budget disaster flicks; I can pretty much turn off my brain and just go with the flow. If you are similarly endowed you will probably enjoy this one too.I was watching it in our den when my wife came in and thought we had seen this one before; I told her it was new but the plot and dialog was familiar. We both got a laugh out of that and agreed that many of the disaster films have much in common. In spite of that I watched this one all the way through and found it tolerably interesting. The special effects are adequate as is the sound; the acting does not really interfere with the plot and on occasion draws one into the story.I suspect that anyone not interested in the disaster flick genre may have trouble watching this all the way through; those of us who do will have no trouble involving ourselves with the characters and the action.It's not a bad film and those who are developing a DVD collection of disaster flicks will likely want to include this one too.,3,Not Too Bad for a Low Budget Disaster Film,1317340800,"09 30, 2011",2011,1031,"['disaster', 'flick', 'fan', 'have', 'special', 'tolerance', 'low', 'budget', 'disaster', 'flicks', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'turn', 'off', 'brain', 'just', 'go', 'flow', 'are', 'similarly', 'endowed', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'one', 'too.I', 'was', 'watching', 'den', 'when', 'wife', 'came', 'thought', 'had', 'seen', 'one', 'told', 'was', 'new', 'plot', 'dialog', 'was', 'familiar', 'got', 'laugh', 'agreed', 'many', 'disaster', 'films', 'have', 'much', 'common', 'spite', 'watched', 'one', 'way', 'found', 'tolerably', 'interesting', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'adequate', 'sound', 'acting', 'not', 'really', 'interfere', 'plot', 'occasion', 'draws', 'one', 'story.I', 'suspect', 'anyone', 'not', 'interested', 'disaster', 'flick', 'genre', 'may', 'have', 'trouble', 'watching', 'way', 'who', 'do', 'will', 'have', 'trouble', 'involving', 'characters', 'action.It', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'who', 'are', 'developing', 'DVD', 'collection', 'disaster', 'flicks', 'will', 'likely', 'want', 'include', 'one', 'too']",N/A
1299011,A2GEQ6I6M11JR2,B002Y2QRSG,Fred Rayworth,"[3, 3]","I had to rush around on this Saturday to make it home in time to catch my early evening SyFy icky bug. I love disaster movies and though not strictly icky bug, they have some of the same thrills (or lack, thereof). In this one, it reminded me of a million other apocalypse movies with the usual breakdown in society. At the same time it reminded me a bit of Mad Max.There are plenty of plot holes like when the hero and the impossibly gorgeous girl are picked up by two federal agents and are chased by a bunch of mindless ATV riders on the attack. They leave the surviving agent to shoot it out with these whackos while they run across the desert away from the scene. Yet, nobody chases after them. Hmmm.Then there is the girl. Instead of finding some normal looking woman, he finds a gorgeous babe who just can't keep a decent boyfriend. Yeah, sure. To me, that was the most impossible thing about the plot. They picked a real piece of eye candy. Nothing against her acting, it's just far more unrealistic to see that than the instant cure for this mysterious disease (another plot twist) that the scientists cooked up in just a few days.I go into these movies expecting wide plot holes and this movie was no exception. The ending was too predictable, but I'm glad it went the way it did instead of what could have been a total bummer ending. If that had happened, this would be a one star movie.All in all, I was glad I was able to sit down and watch it. Great escapism.

Joe Lando plays David, a man who seems to be upset with life in general, but takes it out with shortness on his wife and daughter.  Meahwhile a meteor is broken up in space by nuclear missles making the debris head towards Earth, Lake Mead, NV to be exact, and poisons the water supply. David is called into work and finds his co-worker foaming at the mouth and David realizes the water has been contaminated. He tells his wife on the phone not to drink the water, only to hear on the other end, his wife asking the daughter if she drank the water, and then the phone goes dead. David rushes home trying to avoid meteors falling from the sky. He arrives as his neighborhood is being evacuated and is kept from his family who are being quarantined. David escapes from those detaining him and vows to find his family, whom he loves and wants to apologize to for his attitude. Traveling on foot he comes across a woman who seems to be sick after drinking a soft drink. He helps her and they travel in her Jeep to find his family. But once again meteors attack from the sky and the vehicle stops running. They travel on foot to find his family have been taken from Las Vegas to Los Angeles. The movie continues on this theme where David is determined to be with his wife and daughter all the while fighting off guys with guns and those pesky meteors. Claudia Christian plays Kate, David's wife. She isn't in the movie much, but she is good whenever she is. Cooper Harris is great as the sick woman David finds and who ultimately helps him look for his family. But Joe Lando is the real star of this movie. He is very believable as a man who will do anything, fight any obstacle, to be with his family.
