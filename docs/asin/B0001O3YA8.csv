812156,A1TD6UX5O8VNIF,B0001O3YA8,Amazon Customer,"[2, 2]","I was half-expecting a kind of Van Helsing-esque presentation, one that was well, ok..and Dark Fury was for the most part just ok, mainly because it was so short, but I left feeling pretty satisfied, even though we probably could have skipped from the beginning(except for the last part with Jack) and ended with Riddick dropping Jack and Imam on Helion Prime.Dark Fury did have a pretty coherent plot, and Junner was cool.  Chillingsworth was a rather over-the-top character, some physcho witch who thinks death is an art form.  The introduction of Toombs was good, and the two alien species introduced were both well-rendered and designed by computer animation (I'll let you see what they are).The animation was top-notch, with what I consider to be second only to realistic, attractive drawing, and that is great colors.  Chung and his guys used a lot of neat red and purple lighting, so nothing lacking there.  I found it somewhat disturbing that the animation changed when Jack and Imam were trying to escape out the hangar and were met by Junner.  As Riddick and Junner fight (for about the first twenty seconds or so), it looks like a four-year old drew it (no offense).  Junner, Riddick, and  Jack have these thick lines around them, and they'r e rather grotesque.  Also, Riddick's computer rendered spaceship looks like a Dollar Tree plastic toy.  But for all my criticism, it was only for a bit anwyway so no biggie (I just had a laugh at those previous things, doesn't really take anything away from the flick).The voice acting was great because we had Vin Diesel, of course.  His resonatingly low pipes just ring ""cool"".  Rhiana Griffith was good for the part she was given, Chunlund did his usual ""Wolverine"" imitation as Toombs, Junner had a cool voice, and Keith David's Imam will always be good.  Chillingsworth had some kind of Slavic accent, and was kinda funny sometimes with her accent.  As far as parents are concerned, there were three ""s-words"", one ""a-word"", one ""bitc-word"", and one ""bast-word"".  A decent amount of blood in the opening fight scene, almost none afterwards.Overall, really good foray into animation, outdoing its equivalent Van Helsing (though I liked the London Assignment).  Good art, colors, and decent plotline make this worth at least a rental (I want to buy it, but that may be because I'm Riddick's No. 1 fan).

812158,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B0001O3YA8,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[0, 2]","First off, Dark Fury is NOT ANIME, so if you're an anime purest, then don't pick this up. It was animated by Peter Chung, the same man who made Aeon Flux and the final episode on the Animatrix, and he doesn't follow the same anime traditions (i.e. big eyes, no lip-sinking, large heads).That out of the way, I have to say I've always found Peter Chung's style a little off-putting, what with his goofy character design and strange contortions in the scenes of action. Though the animation quality is there (the movements of all the characters are fluid, if bizarre), the way in which it is animated steals away some of that quality; especially when he suddenly changes styles part way through the cartoon, during the climactic fight.For me, David Twohy saved this, the director of both Chronicles of Riddick movies and the writer of Dark Fury. The story is perfect, bridging the two movies and introducing characters that kind of just appeared on the second movie (Tombs). To go along with the excellent writing, they were able to get Vin Diesel and Keith David to play the characters they had in Pitch Black, making it feel a little more authentic as a release in this series.The story itself takes place only moments after Riddick and friends escape the planet in which they were at on Pitch Black, as they are being captured by a mercenary ship who wants to claim Riddick for his bounty, or something else. The captain of this ship, a truly macabre woman, collects human statues of some of the galaxies greatest warriors, and she wants to add Riddick to her collection. Riddick, of course, doesn't plan on becoming a piece of art, and decides to escape the ship. What follows is a grouping of intense action scenes as the companions try to achieve this.The bad thing, though, is that this movie isn't needed. You can watch Pitch Black and Chronicles back to back and have no confusion, especially since the events in Dark Fury are never mentioned in the second movie. For that reason alone, I can't recommend this unless you are an Aeon Flux fan or a true fan of Chronicles of Riddick.",3,NOT ANIME,1136678400,"01 8, 2006",2006,2088,"['First', 'off', 'Dark', 'Fury', 'NOT', 'ANIME', 'so', ""'re"", 'anime', 'purest', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'was', 'animated', 'Peter', 'Chung', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'made', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'final', 'episode', 'Animatrix', ""n't"", 'follow', 'same', 'anime', 'traditions', 'i.e', 'big', 'eyes', 'lip-sinking', 'large', 'heads', '.That', 'way', 'have', 'say', ""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'Peter', 'Chung', 'style', 'little', 'off-putting', 'what', 'goofy', 'character', 'design', 'strange', 'contortions', 'scenes', 'action', 'animation', 'quality', 'there', 'movements', 'characters', 'are', 'fluid', 'bizarre', 'way', 'animated', 'steals', 'away', 'quality', 'especially', 'when', 'suddenly', 'styles', 'part', 'way', 'cartoon', 'climactic', 'fight.For', 'David', 'Twohy', 'saved', 'director', 'Chronicles', 'Riddick', 'movies', 'writer', 'Dark', 'Fury', 'story', 'perfect', 'bridging', 'two', 'movies', 'introducing', 'characters', 'kind', 'just', 'appeared', 'second', 'movie', 'Tombs', 'go', 'along', 'excellent', 'writing', 'were', 'able', 'get', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'Keith', 'David', 'play', 'characters', 'had', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'making', 'feel', 'little', 'more', 'authentic', 'release', 'series.The', 'story', 'place', 'only', 'moments', 'Riddick', 'friends', 'escape', 'planet', 'were', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'are', 'being', 'captured', 'mercenary', 'ship', 'who', 'claim', 'Riddick', 'bounty', 'something', 'else', 'captain', 'ship', 'truly', 'macabre', 'woman', 'human', 'statues', 'galaxies', 'greatest', 'warriors', 'add', 'Riddick', 'collection', 'Riddick', 'course', ""n't"", 'plan', 'becoming', 'piece', 'art', 'escape', 'ship', 'What', 'grouping', 'intense', 'action', 'scenes', 'companions', 'try', 'achieve', 'this.The', 'bad', 'thing', 'movie', ""n't"", 'needed', 'can', 'watch', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'Chronicles', 'back', 'back', 'have', 'confusion', 'especially', 'events', 'Dark', 'Fury', 'are', 'never', 'mentioned', 'second', 'movie', 'reason', 'alone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'are', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'fan', 'true', 'fan', 'Chronicles', 'Riddick']",N/A

I've never been a fan of Peter Chung. My only previous experience with his work was &quot;Aeon Flux&quot;, which I found hard to follow.However, Dark Fury was brilliant. The dark imagery and the visual concepts followed the trend set by Pitch Black. I was pleased to see they used the actors from Pitch Black rather than go with other voice actors for the characters.I wasn't overly thrilled with the way the main characters were drawn. The characters that crossed over bore some resemblance to their live action counterparts, but there were some glaring differences that I and friends noticed. It was the type of visual differences you often see between action figures and the actors who played the part in the movie - the resemblance seems to exist only because you're looking for it.That doesn't mean that the animation was done poorly, however. The blend of computer animation and hand-drawn work creates a background that is almost dizzying at times. Certainly, it allowed the artists the ability a freedom to create some scenes that would have been difficult with live action.I liked the additional features with interviews, but felt at times that they had been included more as an advertisement for the next movie &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot; than to give any actual insight into the process of creating Dark Fury.If you're a fan of Pitch Black and want to understand the full story of the characters, this is a &quot;must buy&quot;, along with the books and games.

I liked both Pitch Black and the Chronicles or Riddick and it I like the idea of filling in certain gaps.  I believe there are a number of angles that could be covered in the Riddick storyline.  With Dark Fury I think that it helps, only slightly, in explaining the beginning of Chronicles of Riddick sequal and one of the scenes in the sequal when Riddick and Jack are on Crematoria.Yet, like other reviewers this was just to short for me.  Just when I had gotten into it, it was over.  This is critical to me since I was thinking about buying it.  I am glad that I had rented it, where I watched it twice and then after that I got all I needed from it.I think this anime would have better if it was a part of a series dealing with Riddick's past.  It would be better if they made a series of Riddick animations and then sold them together.  It would nice to know what happened to Riddick during his years in prison.

Given the success of The Animatrix, it was a semi-growing trend at the time to do made-for-video animated spinoffs to feature films, not to be confused with all the home sequals Disney did for their original movies. Dark Fury acts as a bridge between the first movie, Pitch Black(a killer sci-fi/thriller!), and the somewhat successful COR sci-fi/adventure. Although, unlike some other media tie-ins like comic book prequels, this actually has some resonance to the given material.Taking place right after their escape from the hellish pterodactyl planet, Riddick along with survivors Jack and Imam(all voiced by their original actors)get picked up by a swanky ship filled with space mercs. This cruiser is run by the sultry Chillingsworth, who collects bounties, not to collect on the price on their heads, but to keep them as works of art by literally putting them on ice. She gives Riddick a challenge to save his comrades in a fight to the death with some alien creatures. Riddick succeeds, and frees the others as they make their escape from an entire ship of bounty hunters set to catch them. After taking down most of the competition, Riddick squares off with Chillingsworth's main flunky, and finally the dragon lady herself. The trio gets away, but the bounty hunter Tombs lives through the ordeal with his sights set on bringing in Riddick.Peter Chung of Aeon Flux fame was the director behind this, and his style of animation pays off very well, although there's some shots during some of the last fight that seemed to have less detail put into them, possibly to get this project done in time to coincide with the COR movie release. Dark Fury is currently available only on its on single DVD release, as well as the Riddick Trilogy DVD box set.

It follows the characters of Riddick, Abu 'Imam al-Walid, and Jack as they cross paths with a ship of body hunters (they catch people and freeze them for later use) and are brought on board.  The captain of the ship, Chillingsworth has an interesting hobby - she captures wanted criminals and makes living statues of them.No surprise, Riddick is high on her list of cryo-candidates.  Using Jack and Abu as bait Chillingsworth forces Riddick to participate in a life or death.  As you may imagine, Riddick doesn't fight on a schedule, nor does he call it quits when the curtain falls.  Be prepared for a string of grim confrontations as our anti-hero takes on an entire ship.I'm not as big a fan of the Aeon Flux animation team as others are, but they really did managed to make this film work with only a slight touch if CGI.  The high level of action seems to fit the style very well, and even Riddick's brutality displays moments of true grace.  My big complaint, and the reason this will never get more than four stars from me, is that it is way too short.

812191,APEJ4UN2JQNSN,B0001O3YA8,"Sasa Husaric ""sasa28""","[0, 0]","Riddick first appeared in &#34;Pitch Black&#34; (2000.) which was directed by David Twohy. Vin Diesel was a perfect casting for such an antihero type and he does a good job unlike the performances he gave in some of his earlier movies (&#34;XXX&#34;&#62; or &#34;Fast and Furious&#34;). In &#34;Pitch Black&#34; Riddick is introduced as a dangerous criminal who reluctantly becomes a hero and saves a girl named Jack (Rhianna Griffith) and Imam (Keith David) from a planet inhabited by flesh eating aliens. The aliens only come out of their hiding during the solar eclipse which happens only once in many years hence the title &#34;Pitch Black&#34;. The movie ends with Riddick, Jack and Imam leaving the planet in a small space craft.&#34;The Chronicles of Riddick&#34; happens five years after the events in Pitch Black and a lot has changed in that time.Dark Fury was created as a bridge between the two movies and to allow the authors to delve a little deeper into the universe of Riddick. The movie only partially succeeds in that attempt. Dark Fury is only 35 minutes long and it is not enough time to explore something deeply. The movie starts right where Pitch Black left off. Riddick and his companions are in a small ship but are being captured by mercenaries. Riddick attempts to hide his identity but doesn't succeed as the mercenaries have a lot of advanced technology on their ship. The enigmatic mercenary leader (Chillingsworth) orders that Riddicks ship be brought in and occupants captured. Riddick resists and in a pretty bloody sequence kills a lot of mercenaries but again shows weakness when Jack's life is threatened.Chillingsworth is fascinated by death and shows Riddick her collection of captured killers who are displayed like exhibits in a museum. But she has something more planned for Riddick who is a crown jewel in her collection. Riddick is to become a living exhibit, but he manages to escape and again save the lives of Jack and Imam.Action sequences in this movie are exciting and well choreographed in a Japanese anime style which is to be expected since the director is Peter Chung (&#34;Animatrix: Matriculated&#34;). But for an American cartoon they are pretty bloody and not suitable for children. Visually &#34;Dark Fury&#34; is pretty impressive looking with some of the best computer generated imagery I've seen. Most of the environment was rendered on a computer but the majority of characters were drawn by hand.But, other than the visuals there is little to be enjoyed in the movie. Nothing new is added to the Riddick universe that we already don't know. Riddick's mysterious origin is just reinforced and not the least bit explained. Only thing we learn is why Riddick is separated from Imam and Jack and the character of Toombs is introduced which will play a big role in &#34;The Chronicles of Riddick&#34;. It would be nice to see some of the Riddick universe and not just a collection of, admittedly very good, action sequences.The special features on the &#34;Dark Fury&#34; DVD are:From Pitch Black to Chronicles of Riddick is an 8 minute basic promotional documentary the likes of which can be found on almost any DVD out there. It features a brief look at making of the animated film and is not very interesting.Animatic to animation is a look at edited storyboards for the full length of the movie.Peter Chung - The Mind of an Animator is an interview with the director. This is actually interesting as it provides an insightful look at a creative process of an animation director. It is only 5 minutes but Chung makes some interesting comments about his style of making animated movies.Into the Light is an extended trailers for &#34;The Chronicles of Riddick&#34; and contains a lot of spoilers so beware.Visually the movie is stunning. It is presented in widescreen anamorphic format 1.85:1 and the picture is gorgeous. Colors are vibrant and the animation is smooth. All the characters look alive and the voices of the original cast from &#34;Pitch Black&#34; is a big plus. But other than that and great action there is no meat to the story, the universe of Riddick is not explored to it's potential. We see mercenaries but that was established in the movie &#34;Pitch Black&#34;. We learn nothing about &#34;Necromongers&#34; which are the enemies of Riddick in &#34;The Chronicles of Riddick&#34;.If you are a fan of Riddick and love action than this is recommended, otherwise don't buy it.",3,"Great action, not much else",1097712000,"10 14, 2004",2004,4455,"['Riddick', 'first', 'appeared', '34', 'Pitch', 'Black', '34', '2000', 'was', 'directed', 'David', 'Twohy', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'was', 'perfect', 'casting', 'such', 'antihero', 'type', 'good', 'job', 'performances', 'gave', 'earlier', 'movies', '34', 'XXX', '34', '62', '34', 'Fast', 'Furious', '34', '34', 'Pitch', 'Black', '34', 'Riddick', 'introduced', 'dangerous', 'criminal', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'hero', 'girl', 'named', 'Jack', 'Rhianna', 'Griffith', 'Imam', 'Keith', 'David', 'planet', 'inhabited', 'flesh', 'eating', 'aliens', 'aliens', 'only', 'come', 'hiding', 'solar', 'eclipse', 'only', 'once', 'many', 'years', 'hence', 'title', '34', 'Pitch', 'Black', '34', 'movie', 'Riddick', 'Jack', 'Imam', 'leaving', 'planet', 'small', 'space', 'craft.', '34', 'Chronicles', 'Riddick', '34', 'five', 'years', 'events', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'lot', 'changed', 'time.Dark', 'Fury', 'was', 'created', 'bridge', 'two', 'movies', 'allow', 'authors', 'delve', 'little', 'deeper', 'universe', 'Riddick', 'movie', 'only', 'partially', 'attempt', 'Dark', 'Fury', 'only', '35', 'minutes', 'long', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'explore', 'something', 'deeply', 'movie', 'right', 'where', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'left', 'off', 'Riddick', 'companions', 'are', 'small', 'ship', 'are', 'being', 'captured', 'mercenaries', 'Riddick', 'hide', 'identity', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'mercenaries', 'have', 'lot', 'advanced', 'technology', 'ship', 'enigmatic', 'mercenary', 'leader', 'Chillingsworth', 'orders', 'Riddicks', 'ship', 'be', 'brought', 'occupants', 'captured', 'Riddick', 'resists', 'pretty', 'bloody', 'sequence', 'lot', 'mercenaries', 'again', 'shows', 'weakness', 'when', 'Jack', 'life', 'threatened.Chillingsworth', 'fascinated', 'death', 'Riddick', 'collection', 'captured', 'killers', 'who', 'are', 'displayed', 'exhibits', 'museum', 'something', 'more', 'planned', 'Riddick', 'who', 'crown', 'jewel', 'collection', 'Riddick', 'become', 'living', 'exhibit', 'escape', 'again', 'save', 'lives', 'Jack', 'Imam.Action', 'sequences', 'movie', 'are', 'exciting', 'well', 'choreographed', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'style', 'be', 'expected', 'director', 'Peter', 'Chung', '34', 'Animatrix', 'Matriculated', '34', 'American', 'cartoon', 'are', 'pretty', 'bloody', 'not', 'suitable', 'children', 'Visually', '34', 'Dark', 'Fury', '34', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'looking', 'best', 'computer', 'generated', 'imagery', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Most', 'environment', 'was', 'rendered', 'computer', 'majority', 'characters', 'were', 'drawn', 'hand.But', 'other', 'visuals', 'little', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Nothing', 'new', 'added', 'Riddick', 'universe', 'already', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Riddick', 'mysterious', 'origin', 'just', 'reinforced', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'explained', 'Only', 'thing', 'learn', 'why', 'Riddick', 'separated', 'Imam', 'Jack', 'character', 'Toombs', 'introduced', 'will', 'play', 'big', 'role', '34', 'Chronicles', 'Riddick', '34', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'Riddick', 'universe', 'not', 'just', 'collection', 'admittedly', 'very', 'good', 'action', 'sequences.The', 'special', 'features', '34', 'Dark', 'Fury', '34', 'DVD', 'are', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'Chronicles', 'Riddick', '8', 'minute', 'basic', 'promotional', 'documentary', 'likes', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'almost', 'DVD', 'there', 'brief', 'look', 'making', 'animated', 'film', 'not', 'very', 'interesting.Animatic', 'animation', 'look', 'edited', 'storyboards', 'full', 'length', 'movie.Peter', 'Chung', 'Mind', 'Animator', 'interview', 'director', 'actually', 'interesting', 'insightful', 'look', 'creative', 'process', 'animation', 'director', 'only', '5', 'minutes', 'Chung', 'interesting', 'comments', 'style', 'making', 'animated', 'Light', 'extended', 'trailers', '34', 'Chronicles', 'Riddick', '34', 'lot', 'spoilers', 'so', 'beware.Visually', 'movie', 'stunning', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'anamorphic', 'format', '1.85:1', 'picture', 'gorgeous', 'Colors', 'are', 'vibrant', 'animation', 'smooth', 'characters', 'look', 'alive', 'voices', 'original', 'cast', '34', 'Pitch', 'Black', '34', 'big', 'plus', 'other', 'great', 'action', 'meat', 'story', 'universe', 'Riddick', 'not', 'explored', 'potential', 'see', 'mercenaries', 'was', 'established', 'movie', '34', 'Pitch', 'Black', '34', 'learn', 'nothing', '34', 'Necromongers', '34', 'are', 'enemies', 'Riddick', '34', 'Chronicles', 'Riddick', '34', 'are', 'fan', 'Riddick', 'love', 'action', 'recommended', 'otherwise', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy']",N/A

Each one of these ""chapters"" gives a bit of information about Riddick and the series of events around him. Dark Fury is a short tale and the detracted one from the series. The story itself has very little to add to the  Riddick epic, but the little details do give you a segueway between Pitch Black and Chronicles of Riddick.Like I said. The story is way off into left field. Apparently soon after Riddick and his cohorts leave the planet from Pitch Black they get captured by a ship full of mercs, controlled by some lady who has a thing for killers. The plot itself isn't so bad, but the way they execute it doesn't meld as well. This animated film is nothing more than ego worship for the Riddick character. There is no real plot or character development because of this. Just Riddick kicking butt and people being impressed by it.The artwork is definitely Chung. Although you won't see the same action sequences that were signature in his early works like Aen Flux, the art itself is more polished on the characters. They are much less... how can I put this?... skinny and puppet-like... than Aeon. The voice acting is superb with the original actors from Pitch Black doing the voices of Riddick, Imam and ""Jack"".This 30 minute short is a mix of cel animation and computer animation and I must say the CG side of things is very much lacking. Not only does it stick out like a sore thumb it looks dated... as in what you would expect years ago. The cel animation, on the other hand, is great and very dynamic.The extras are actually pretty nice for such a short show. ""Bridging the Gap"" is filled with interviews with actors and production crew on the making of the anime. The interview with Peter Chung is pretty informative on not only this cartoon, but his career as well. The storyboard featurette is essentially the entire cartoon done in storyboard form. Kinda neat if you're into that. Into the Light is a short, but VERY informative featurette on why director David Twohy went the direction he did on Chronicles of Riddick.Dark Fury is a mixed bag, but it should be enough to satisfy the Riddick fan.

A gem of the Asian style of animation, this underseen chapter covers events between ""Pitch Black"" and ""Chronicles"", picking up almost immediately after the former.  Tells a more compact tale, meaning the apprx. 30-minute running time is not a hindrance (although if you want to talk price, then yeah, it could be argued that it should be a little less expensive for its brevity.  Makes up for it by being just plain better than most 2-hour entries in the Action/Sci-Fi field).  The ship carrying the first movie's survivors is picked up by what at first appears to be just another merc ship but turns out to have a much weirder, more original, and more interesting nature; also brings into play some visually astounding alien lifeforms.Eclipses ""Chronicles Of Riddick"" and equals, perhaps surpasses ""Pitch Black""  A must for fans of the series or of such animated fare as ""The Animatrix"", ""Galerians: Rion"" or ""Blood: The Last Vampire"".Interesting sidenote: this isn't star Vin Diesel's first foray into animation.

Of course where the wachowski's innovate, other imitate. The Animatrix was a 90 minute journey into the matrix universe and,for fans, it really went in depth into that world. Van Helsing had some cheapo cartoon released as well and was greeted with a gigantic indifferent yawn.I'm happy to say that Dark Fury is no Van Helsing: London Assignment, but its also not as good as the Animatrix, mainly because its really short. It starts right after Pitch Black, and our anti-heroes run into a necro ship and are forced into yet another fight for their lives. Nothing new is really learned about Riddick or the necromongers. It sets up why Riddick left Jak and Imam. If your really into the film I would recommend it for some more kick @$$ Riddick fight scenes and some great one liners. Its pretty entertaining and with the man behind Aeon Flux and The animatrix:Matriculated at the helm the quality of the animation is top notch. Unlike the movie there is lots of blood spilled and the money shots are in tact. Even in cartoon form Riddick is the man. It features the voices of all the original cast members, including the girl who played Jak in Pitch Black. (Funny how they will bring her back for this but not for the movie.)It has a few features on the making of the cartoon, where you can sorta laugh at Vin Diesel trying to make the cartoon sound real deep, and you get a quickie look at The Chroniclces movie.

The trend is this: action movie sequels often have gaps from the first film to the second, and therefore to fill in the gap an animated film is made to tell what happens. DARK FURY supposedly fills in part of the gap between where PITCH BLACK ends and THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK begins.DARK FURY begins almostly immediately where PITCH BLACK left off. Riddick, Jack, and Imam have just blasted off from the planet of darkness when they are pulled into a Merc ship. The Merc leader on the ship, Chillingsworth, is thrilled at the ""capture"" of Riddick, the most wanted man in the universe. She has captured and collected many of the universe's most notorious creatures. She sees them as works of art and has transformed many of them into living and breathing statues. However, with the capture of Riddick she has an opportunity to see an ""artist"" such as Riddick in action.There isn't much of a story here, though DARK FURY does explain why Riddick left Imam and Jack on Helios. But for a 35-minute cartoon, that's not much. I was expecting more--what did Jack do after Riddick dropped her off with Imam, for example could have been an issue to explore. However, Riddick and not Jack is the focus. The animation isn't all that extraordinary and there really isn't anything spectacular here.DARK FURY includes a featurette that gives a look at the making of DARK FURY, an interview with animator Peter Chung, a preview look at THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK, and a sequence of moving storyboards that illustrates how DARK FURY went from paper drawings to final product.I'd recommend this DVD only for fans of the Riddick universe.
