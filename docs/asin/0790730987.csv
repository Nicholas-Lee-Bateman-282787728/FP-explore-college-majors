This film covers 15 or 20 years in the life of Miss Daisy, beginning with her wrecking the car. Her son hires a chauffeur against her wishes. Etc. Dan Ackroyd shows us that he can act. After GHOSTBUSTERS and BLUES BROTHERS I had my doubts.This deceptively simple story works because Morgan Freeman and Jessica Tandy are so skilled. I think Freeman was more deserving of an Oscar than Tandy, but I'm not knocking her win when I say that. Set in the South, starting in the early 1950s, and as a Southerner myself I particularly enjoyed the authentic dialogue. It covered some ""heavy issues"" with a light touch, but that's because it wasn't about those issues. It was about its characters. And hey, we know the issues already. This is simply a wonderful film. I'll watch it again.

This story was taken right out of the South in the '50 &  early '60's. Morgan Freeman plays the part of a Chauffeur to Miss Daisy (Jessica Tandy). The trouble is Miss Daisy doesn't want a anybody driving her around but her son(Dan Aykroyd)  is determined she is going to have a chauffeur after she has an accident backing up her car. She is so cantankerous and she just does her best to get rid of that chauffeur but he hangs in there. The film tells the poignant story of a working relationship of 20 years that turned into a friendship.I think this is one of Morgan Freeman's best performances and Jessica Tandy also. Jessica Tandy got an Academy Award (1990) for Best Actress for this role and Morgan Freeman was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role (1990) in this Picture.

Every inch of the movie is enjoyable and everyone has give their best performance.The story is about the relations between Daisy, an old lady, and Hoke, her chauffeur. The relation between Morgan and Ms.Daisy is a beautiful poem - like a river taking rough course initially, struggling and flowing smoothly before merging with the ocean. Ms.Daisy feels initially that she is a strong woman - mentally and physically - not believing that she has gotten old. His son feels that she needs help and gets a chaffeur for his mother. Ms.Daisy gets angry and neglects Morgan. But Morgan never leaves Ms.Daisy in spite of this. He shops, cooks, sobs and pats until Mr.Daisy comes to know the relationship.

Maybe it was because anyone who tried to describe it made it sound dull. It's not. It's a real heart-warmer.Jessica Tandy is Daisy Werthan, who is not actually a miss, but a widow. She's in her 70s when she drove her car into the neighbor's shrubbery because she put the gear in reverse when she meant to go forward. Her son Boolie Werthan (Dan Aykroyd) hires a driver for her named Hoke Colburn (Morgan Freeman), but it takes all his ingenuity to persuade her to let him driver her. She insists it's not prejudice, but she hates having him invading her privacy.The Werthans are Jewish, and Hoke allows how he prefers to work for Jews, as he has found he is treated more fairly by Jews than by white Christians. But in Atlanta, Georgia, in the post-war boom era, Boolie is respected primarily because he is a successful businessman. Still, Daisy finds out that on a trip to Alabama to visit relatives, she and Hoke are both treated as objects of scorn.Eventually Hoke gets too old to drive, and Miss Daisy is put in a nursing home, but he goes to visit her frequently. At one point she said, with rather a tone of surprise, that Hoke was her best friend.There are many fine small incidents and subtle touches, and it's not at all hard to see why it won several Oscars.",5,Earned All Those Oscars,1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,1349,"['one', 'ones', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'why', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'see', 'Maybe', 'was', 'anyone', 'who', 'tried', 'describe', 'made', 'sound', 'dull', 'not', 'real', 'heart-warmer.Jessica', 'Tandy', 'Daisy', 'Werthan', 'who', 'not', 'actually', 'miss', 'widow', '70s', 'when', 'drove', 'car', 'neighbor', 'shrubbery', 'put', 'gear', 'reverse', 'when', 'meant', 'go', 'forward', 'son', 'Boolie', 'Werthan', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'driver', 'named', 'Hoke', 'Colburn', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'ingenuity', 'persuade', 'let', 'driver', 'not', 'prejudice', 'having', 'invading', 'privacy.The', 'Werthans', 'are', 'Jewish', 'Hoke', 'how', 'work', 'Jews', 'found', 'treated', 'more', 'fairly', 'Jews', 'white', 'Christians', 'Atlanta', 'Georgia', 'post-war', 'boom', 'era', 'Boolie', 'respected', 'primarily', 'successful', 'businessman', 'Still', 'Daisy', 'out', 'trip', 'Alabama', 'visit', 'relatives', 'Hoke', 'are', 'treated', 'objects', 'scorn.Eventually', 'Hoke', 'too', 'old', 'drive', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'put', 'nursing', 'home', 'visit', 'frequently', 'one', 'point', 'said', 'rather', 'tone', 'surprise', 'Hoke', 'was', 'best', 'are', 'many', 'fine', 'small', 'incidents', 'subtle', 'touches', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'won', 'several', 'Oscars']",N/A

94353,A1ZAVMB4XZL8KA,0790730987,"Bookreader79424 ""I love Casa Ole!""","[11, 12]","""Driving Miss Daisy"" is about an elderly, well-to-do, widow named Miss Daisy (Jessica Tandy), a retired school-teacher. Her son believes that she needs extra help with her errands, so as opposed to having his mother, Miss Daisy walk everywhere to run her errands, then her son (Dan Aykroyd) takes it upon himself to hire Miss Daisy, (his mother),  a chauffeur (Morgan Freeman).At first, Miss Daisy doesn't like the idea of being driven around town because she feels that that is being boastful, proud and snobbish. Ironically, Miss Daisy is somewhat of a snob, in her own way, but not purposefully. She's set in her ways, a true traditionalist, who refuses to become progressive. at all costs. While wealthy, she doesn't want to appear as pretentious or ostentatious because after all, she was just a poor farm girl as she puts it in the film; hence, her reasons for refusing to hire a chauffeur; although, ironically, she does have a maid, who is one of her best friends.At first, Miss Daisy is extremely hateful and rude to her chauffeur, (Morgan Freeman), but realizes that he's only doing his job to the best of his abilities and as the times change, so does Miss Daisy's attitude toward her driver.As the film progresses, so does Miss Daisy's affinity (i.e., liking) for her chauffeur (Mr. Morgan Freeman). She teaches him how to read because sadly he cannot read. Being a retired teacher, while visiting her deceased husband at the cemetary, she realizes that Mr. Freeman is illiterate. Contrary to what most people might do, she doesn't coddle him, but rather encourages him with a tough love approach yet is sensitive to his plight. Her Christmas gift to him, although, she doesn't celebrate Christmas because she doesn't celebrate it, the reason being that she's Jewish, offers him a token of her appreciation and gives him a practice workbook, in order, that he can learn to read and write. Mr. Freeman plays the character in a dignifed manner--not feeling pity for himself because his character is illiterate, but remains friendly, well-mannered and humble. Not once in the film does Morgan Freeman's character allow himself to feel pity for himself. He's a true character, who's humble, well-mannered and most importantly, respectful.Eventually, Miss Daisy travels to the deep south to visit a relative. Eventually, Miss Daisy and her chauffeur (Morgan Freeman) stop on the side of the ride to eat lunch. When they're approached and confronted by a racist and obnoxious police officer, who wishes to see Miss Daisy's chauffeur's proof of ownership and insurance. Miss Daisy's chauffeur politely honors his request and shows him the proof that it's Miss Daisy's car. Secure in knowing that the car is not stolen because that is what is implied by the officer's reasons for harassing Miss Daisy and her driver, then the officer leaves and Miss Daisy's driver and her are soon on their way. Miss Daisy not being an ignorant fool, knows the real reason that they were being confronted by this obnoxious and evil police officer and it was because she is Jewish and her driver is of African-American descent. Of course, being the sophisticated and dignified person that Miss Daisy is along with her driver, they do not choose to acknowledge this overt example of racism. Unfortunately, this was the era, in which, the ""Jim Crow Laws"" were still in effect, hence the reasons for this particular event taking place because it was historically-based on over racism taking place in the deep south; especially, during the 50's and 60's. but I digress.Eventually, Miss Daisy begins to treat her chauffeur (Morgan Freeman) with more respect. Secretly she likes him as a friend, but for some reason, she doesn't want him to know that she cares for him as a friend. It's most likely because she's extremely conservative and probably not one to wear her heart on her sleeve. However, be that as it may, Miss Daisy likes her driver, but throughout the film she is somewhat stern and hateful to him, which grates on your nerves because you think to yourself, ""Is she ever going to be nice to him?"" In her own way, she allows herself to become more emotionally-attached to her driver in a platonic, inoocent, friendly sense, which makes this film a gem.Ultimately, I highly recommend this film to anyone over 13 due to the racial slurs involved in this film (in that one particular scene with the police officer), who wishes to see a heart-warming story about an elderly woman, set in her ways, but willing to overcome her own biases and realizes that one of her best-friends she could ever have is her driver.",5,"Entertaining, poignant and heart-warming",1139788800,"02 13, 2006",2006,4603,"['Driving', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'elderly', 'well-to-do', 'widow', 'named', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'retired', 'school-teacher', 'son', 'extra', 'help', 'errands', 'so', 'opposed', 'having', 'mother', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'walk', 'everywhere', 'run', 'errands', 'then', 'son', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'hire', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'mother', 'chauffeur', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', '.At', 'first', 'Miss', 'Daisy', ""n't"", 'like', 'idea', 'being', 'driven', 'town', 'being', 'boastful', 'proud', 'snobbish', 'Ironically', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'somewhat', 'snob', 'own', 'way', 'not', 'purposefully', 'set', 'ways', 'true', 'traditionalist', 'who', 'become', 'progressive', 'costs', 'wealthy', ""n't"", 'want', 'appear', 'pretentious', 'ostentatious', 'was', 'just', 'poor', 'farm', 'girl', 'film', 'hence', 'reasons', 'refusing', 'hire', 'chauffeur', 'ironically', 'have', 'maid', 'who', 'one', 'best', 'friends.At', 'first', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'extremely', 'hateful', 'rude', 'chauffeur', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'only', 'doing', 'job', 'best', 'abilities', 'times', 'change', 'so', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'attitude', 'driver.As', 'film', 'so', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'affinity', 'i.e.', 'liking', 'chauffeur', 'Mr.', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'how', 'read', 'because', 'sadly', 'can', 'not', 'read', 'Being', 'retired', 'teacher', 'visiting', 'deceased', 'husband', 'cemetary', 'Mr.', 'Freeman', 'illiterate', 'Contrary', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'might', 'do', ""n't"", 'coddle', 'rather', 'tough', 'love', 'approach', 'yet', 'sensitive', 'plight', 'Christmas', 'gift', ""n't"", 'celebrate', 'Christmas', ""n't"", 'celebrate', 'reason', 'being', 'Jewish', 'token', 'appreciation', 'practice', 'workbook', 'order', 'can', 'learn', 'read', 'write', 'Mr.', 'Freeman', 'character', 'dignifed', 'manner', 'not', 'feeling', 'pity', 'character', 'illiterate', 'friendly', 'well-mannered', 'humble', 'Not', 'once', 'film', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'character', 'allow', 'feel', 'pity', 'true', 'character', 'who', 'humble', 'well-mannered', 'most', 'importantly', 'respectful.Eventually', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'deep', 'south', 'visit', 'relative', 'Eventually', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'chauffeur', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'stop', 'side', 'ride', 'eat', 'lunch', 'When', ""'re"", 'approached', 'confronted', 'racist', 'obnoxious', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'see', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'chauffeur', 'proof', 'ownership', 'insurance', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'chauffeur', 'politely', 'request', 'proof', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'car', 'Secure', 'knowing', 'car', 'not', 'stolen', 'what', 'implied', 'officer', 'reasons', 'harassing', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'driver', 'then', 'officer', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'driver', 'are', 'soon', 'way', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'not', 'being', 'ignorant', 'fool', 'real', 'reason', 'were', 'being', 'confronted', 'obnoxious', 'evil', 'police', 'officer', 'was', 'Jewish', 'driver', 'African-American', 'descent', 'course', 'being', 'sophisticated', 'dignified', 'person', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'along', 'driver', 'do', 'not', 'choose', 'acknowledge', 'overt', 'example', 'racism', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'era', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'Laws', 'were', 'still', 'effect', 'hence', 'reasons', 'particular', 'event', 'taking', 'place', 'was', 'historically-based', 'racism', 'taking', 'place', 'deep', 'south', 'especially', '50', '60', 'digress.Eventually', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'treat', 'chauffeur', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'more', 'respect', 'Secretly', 'friend', 'reason', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'friend', 'most', 'likely', 'extremely', 'conservative', 'probably', 'not', 'one', 'wear', 'heart', 'sleeve', 'However', 'be', 'may', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'driver', 'film', 'somewhat', 'stern', 'hateful', 'nerves', 'think', 'yourself', 'ever', 'going', 'be', 'nice', 'own', 'way', 'become', 'more', 'emotionally-attached', 'driver', 'platonic', 'inoocent', 'friendly', 'sense', 'film', 'gem.Ultimately', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', '13', 'due', 'racial', 'slurs', 'involved', 'film', 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'see', 'heart-warming', 'story', 'elderly', 'woman', 'set', 'ways', 'willing', 'overcome', 'own', 'biases', 'one', 'best-friends', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'driver']",N/A
94354,A3BIFXBEOT5AEV,0790730987,Brad Childs,"[5, 6]","Beginning in Atlanta Georgia in 1948, Southern Jewish-matron Daisy Werthan looses control of her brand new '48 Packard while backing out of the garage. After panicking Miss Daisy slams on the gas (instead of the break) and backs her car into a ditch causing some concern for both her safety and her eligibility for motor vehicle insurance. In reference to these concerns, Boolie a local businessman and Miss Daisy's son, hires his mother a driver and purchases her a new 48 Hudson for his mother to ride in. When confronted with antagonism, Miss Daisies new driver Hoke meets confrontation with charming submission and an equally stubborn disposition as the decades pass by on there friendship.GlassesThe opening dialoged in this movie is a conversation between Boolie and his mother Daisy would has just crashed her car. Boolie suggests that Miss Daisy needs glasses. He is somewhat comedic but overall forceful and logical. He is much less concerned with his mother's problem and much more concerned with fixing things. When he tells his mother she might need glasses Miss Daisy responds with, ""the cumbers are nice this time of year"". When Boolie tells his mother that she is lucky to be alive (and we'll come back to this later) Daisy tells her son ""it was the cars fault"".Religion and RaceReligion too is a major point of discussion within this movie. At one point Daisy is upset with her son because he is ""socializing with Episcopalians"". The way the Boolie handles these comments is with sarcasm or to ignore her comments all together. As the movie progresses on however, Miss Daisy seems to gain some respect for Christianity claiming that Hoke is probably the only real Christian at a party. She also allows the death of her housekeeper and cook Idella to impact her view as she (who is normally very concerned about how she is be see) attends a primarily if not all black church for Idella's funeral. Later Daisy openly attends a dinner where Dr. Martin Luther Kings Jr. is speaking.At one point in the film the audience comes to learn that Miss Daisy's Temple has been bombed. At first she is complacent, but soon she becomes augmentative as she denies even the possibility that Hoke and his informative police officer are telling the truth. While Hokes age and experience has helped him to reflect and remember back on a similar incident of racism in his own past and where he seeks to share and remember Miss Daisy approaches this incident very similarly to the way she handles most problems in her aging life: she ignores the problem or she attempts to argue it away.IndependenceOne of the most pivotal moments in the film comes when Hoke first begins to drive Miss Daisy. As Hoke says, ""it took six days, the same time it took the Lord to make the world"". As Daisy stubbornly walks to the local grocery store known as the Pigly Wiggly, Hoke begins to drive along beside her (we'll come back to this as well). Eventually overcome with embarrassment Miss Daisy gives in and gets into the car amidst the prying eyes of her neighbors.Soon the issue becomes more obvious. Daisy states a number of times that she doesn't need a driver, and that her late husband had taught her how to drive and take care of a car. Clearly daisy feels that she is loosing control over her own life. She no longer cooks for herself, and she no longer drives herself and so she feels she must attempt to control everything she can. She tries to control her son and his marriage she tries to control how people view her in her community and interestingly though she cannot control the steering wheel she does control who has the keys and where the car is parked.Space in the houseAnother interesting piece of information the viewer is given comes from a conversation between Boolie and Daisy just after Hoke is hired. In there talk on the phone Daisy admits to her son that she doesn't want anyone in her house eating her food and taking up space. She deals with a common problem among retired people and wants her things to remain just as she has always had them. Although the care taker Idella has grown on her over the many years she remarks that Hoke makes her feel like she has ""no privacy"". Her response is to openly criticize everything Hoke does and to attempt to get rid of him. Hoke on the other hand is aging as well. However he deals with these issues in a very different way. For the most part Hoke approaches things with simple reason. He is not concerned about the neighbors; he parks the car in the best possible space. He is not going to be told when he can ""make water"" or have control over the keys, and even purchases the old Hudson commanding it for himself on his own terms. Although he too is feeling uncomfortable of being in Miss Daisy's space he feels the need to be useful.UsefulnessUsefulness is certainly a large part of this story about ageing. Both characters in fact deal with this issue in different ways. For Hoke, he cannot handle making money without doing any work. Rather than getting paid and being lazy he sees opportunities to work all around the house (though Daisy won't allow it). Coming back to what I said earlier Hoke ultimately finds his usefulness in driving Miss Daisy as best he can. The pinnacle of this is the encounter where he drives beside her while she walks down to the Piggy Wiggly until she agrees to ride in the car.For Daisy the issue is fairly similar. Daisy is often found talking about the good ol' days, when she was growing up; when there was little to eat and when things were hard. But she doesn't look back on those times as being a stain on her life as Hoke believes he might. Instead she looks back fondly on those times because she felt useful. This can most clearly be seen in the grave yard scene where Hoke reveals that he is functionally illiterate. Daisy reaches what is clearly her kindest moment in the film and things turn towards friendship when she tries to teach him how to read and when she smilingly hands him a reading workbook from her old days as a teacher.The Death of a FriendCertainly one of the most impacting movements of this film comes when Miss Idella passes away. Earlier in the film, just after crashing the car into the ditch Daisy's son Boolie had told his mother that she was lucky to be alive. Daisy's response was to ignore him and to blame the whole things on the car saying, ""it was the cars fault"".  Here though we are confronted with an entirely new kind of Daisy. While she had been rejecting the idea that things were changing, while she had rejected to notion that she was getting older, needed glasses, or could possible die, now Daisy looks at things in a whole new light. The death of Idella forces her to look at her own life and in response to her death Daisy sadly tells Hoke that Idella was the Lucky one.AgingBy the end of the movie each character has aged considerably. Boolie faces ageing with a smile and a joke telling his business friends that he has ""less up here (hair) more down here (fat)"" and that this has made him work harder. Hoke tells Daisy that the old Hudson is ""in the Junk Yard now some 15 years"" and leads the viewer into the next faze of Daisy's life where she has become confused at times and can no longer live at home. At this point we see Hoke in a very similar situation to the Daisy we were introduced to. Hokes eyes are bad and he is now driven around by granddaughter no longer able to do his life's work. Rather than the gradual acceptance of aging like Miss Daisy did, Hoke represents a kind of acceptance. He faces old age with a smile and with his old friend Miss Daisy by his side.",5,A great film,1150848000,"06 21, 2006",2006,7623,"['Beginning', 'Atlanta', 'Georgia', '1948', 'Southern',

I must say that of the Blu-ray's I own, I have been most impressed with several of Warner Brothers' - they seem to do a better job in dealing with their older movies than many other studios are.  They obviously put effort into producing a great Blu-ray transfer and total package for this movie.  Even the booklet that they included was well put together and genuinely interesting to look through.

94364,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,0790730987,C. Middleton,"[3, 3]","In a recent Australian interview, director Bruce Beresford said, when offered the project based on an award winning play by Alfred Uhry that the film would be challenging if nothing else. The premise appeared too simple to keep film-goers interested about the developing relationship between a stubborn, southern old Jewish woman and her aging black American chauffer. Beresford said he was thoroughly surprised and thrilled that the film became such a hit for audiences around the world.The film won four Oscars in 1989 for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Make-up and Best Actress in a leading role, Jessica Tandy.Morgan Freeman was also nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor as Hoke Colburn, the exceedingly patient black southern gentleman, which by sheer determination and sincerity, over many years becomes the friend of this feisty, fiercely independent widow.What is beautiful about this film is the authenticity and delivery of the dialogue - Freeman and Tandy's ""chemistry"" if you like, was nothing less than perfect.Even after seeing this wonderful film many times, Dan Aykroyd's performance as Boolie Werthen, Miss Daisy's devoted son, to my mind, is one of the best performances of his career, even to date. This has to be one of his most ""natural"" performances, as he played the role as if written for him alone.This story is about the growing friendship between two unlikely people, but it also touches on the sadness and inevitability of old age. Growing old is tough because one's independence slowly diminishes as well as one's world. Driving Miss Daisy illustrates this point with grace and elegance.A superb and timeless film that will be just as entertaining in thirty or forty years...",5,Timeless Film about Unlikely Friendship,1191024000,"09 29, 2007",2007,1729,"['recent', 'Australian', 'interview', 'director', 'Bruce', 'Beresford', 'said', 'when', 'offered', 'project', 'based', 'award', 'winning', 'play', 'Alfred', 'Uhry', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'challenging', 'nothing', 'else', 'premise', 'appeared', 'too', 'simple', 'keep', 'film-goers', 'interested', 'developing', 'relationship', 'stubborn', 'southern', 'old', 'Jewish', 'woman', 'aging', 'black', 'American', 'chauffer', 'Beresford', 'said', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'surprised', 'thrilled', 'film', 'became', 'hit', 'audiences', 'world.The', 'film', 'won', 'four', 'Oscars', '1989', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'Best', 'Make-up', 'Best', 'Actress', 'leading', 'role', 'Jessica', 'Tandy.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Hoke', 'Colburn', 'exceedingly', 'patient', 'black', 'southern', 'gentleman', 'sheer', 'determination', 'sincerity', 'many', 'years', 'friend', 'feisty', 'fiercely', 'independent', 'widow.What', 'beautiful', 'film', 'authenticity', 'delivery', 'dialogue', 'Freeman', 'Tandy', 'chemistry', 'like', 'was', 'nothing', 'less', 'perfect.Even', 'seeing', 'wonderful', 'film', 'many', 'times', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'performance', 'Boolie', 'Werthen', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'devoted', 'son', 'mind', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'career', 'even', 'date', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'natural', 'performances', 'played', 'role', 'written', 'alone.This', 'story', 'growing', 'friendship', 'two', 'unlikely', 'people', 'also', 'sadness', 'inevitability', 'old', 'age', 'Growing', 'old', 'tough', 'one', 'independence', 'slowly', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'world', 'Driving', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'point', 'grace', 'elegance.A', 'superb', 'timeless', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'entertaining', 'thirty', 'forty', 'years']",N/A

The sets in here are great, a terrific look at the 1950s through storefronts, billboards, automobiles, etc. Previously, all they had was soft formatted-to-TV disc.It took me awhile to appreciate this film, too.  When I shifted my focus off the irritable old woman (Jessica Tandy) to the long-suffering servant (Morgan Freeman) the whole picture changed. Once I looked at this story through ""Hoke's"" eyes, it became an inspiring story. Freeman's character, ""Hoke Colburn,"" simply provides the best the example of a what true servant of God should act like, plain-and-simple. It's one of the best examples on film I've seen of of patience, kindness, dedication and dignity in a difficult situation. It's also always inspiring to see a nice, good person overturn and win over the opposite with sheer kindness.That's taking nothing away from  Tandy's performance as ""Miss Daisy."" She is awesome.

Jessica Tandy is brilliant as Daisy.  When she crashes her car her son Boolie (Aykroyd) makes it known she can no longer drive and hires a chauffeur for her.

This adaptation of the play version is brilliant.  It tells the story, set between 1940's-1960's, of a fiesty elderly woman who's unhappy of growing old.  As she meets a man who becomes her driver, the story develops into something special.  The combination of stories become increasingly interesting as the two develop a close friendship.  Their relationship beats the racist society and the painful past that the man has endured.  Through everything, their lives change forever.  Her son's frequent visits to her house offer the added entertainment value as it adds to the emotional value.  Despite the twenty-five year plot span, the storyline flows smoothly.  The warm, loving story offers an unforgettable viewing experience.Jessica Tandy performs her role as the unhappy elderly woman splendidly.  Her every expressed emotion is felt upon audiences.  She became the oldest person to win an Oscar, at age 80.  Morgan Freeman and Dan Ackroyd's Oscar nominated roles (Best Actor/ Best Supporting Actor) offer the added unique theme to this great film.  All other actors also performed wonderfully.The quality of &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; proves that it's destined to become a classic in the following years.

94379,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0790730987,Dennis Littrell,"[14, 15]","Take an intense and flawless performance by Jessica Tandy (80-years-old when the movie was released in 1989) and a charming and slyly witty performance by Morgan Freeman (closing in on his fifties)--she a rich Jewish lady of the South, high-toned, spoiled, stubborn to a fault, he a black illiterate chauffeur, wise, patient and in need of a job--and we have the basis for a profound character study.  What we are studying is both the character of the leads and the character of a way of life passing languidly before our eyes.Adapted for the screen from his Pulitzer Prize winning stage play by Alfred Uhry and directed by Bruce Beresford, who previously gave us the remarkable Aussie classic, Breaker Morant (1980), Driving Miss Daisy is one of those films that is a work of art as well as a sociological discovery. Using beautifully constructed scenes carefully observed, Beresford allows us to recall a way of life and a culture that characterized the South during the middle of the last century.  Freeman's Hoke Colburn is black; and, as he mumbles, ""not all that much has changed"" since the days of slavery.  He still has to ""yes'em"" and shuffle his feet and show deference to white folk just to get by.  Miss Daisy Werthan herself is rich and very tight with her money.  She is also as racially prejudiced as a Dixie sheriff, but blind to her prejudices as she rages against the infirmaries of age.The movie begins as she loses control of her car and drives it off the road and into a drainage ditch.  She is shaken but unharmed.  However her driving days are over.  Her son Boolie Werthan, played with a fine touch and surprising restraint by comedian Dan Aykroyd, decides to get her a chauffeur.  But she will not hear of it.  She feels her independence is being threatened, and she doesn't need her son to tell her what to do.  She can take care of herself.  When Boolie arrives with Hoke, who is clearly black, Miss Daisy declares she will not have that man in her house.One feels very strongly at this point how compromised the infirm are when they must rely on help from others.  Let a stranger into your house and there is no telling where it might end.  More that this though, is the underlying idea that dependence on people from a lower social-economic class will in fact have a leveling effect on class distinctions, and this is again something that Miss Daisy (in her ignorance of herself) will not abide.But Hoke says he has wrestled some hogs in the mud in his time and has yet to let one get away, and he will do what is necessary to secure his position as Miss Daisy's driver.  He comes highly recommended, and after listening to him, Boolie has little doubt he got the right man for the job.  Miss Daisy of course is having none of it, and indeed she tells him to get out.  She refuses to get into the car; she won't let him clean the chandelier or weed her garden.  However, he doesn't give up.  He takes all of her contrariness with good spirit and a sunny attitude, and then one day as she tries to go shopping on foot, he follows alongside of her in the car, and after some walking she is persuaded to hop in.On one level this is about racial politics in the South, circa mid- twentieth century, and on another level it is about growing old and coping with life as one grows old.  It is about taking care of oneself and getting the most out of life despite the handicap of a declining body.  This applies to both Hoke and Miss Daisy.  He knows that the physical demands of a chauffeur are more appropriate to his age than some of the physical work he did when younger, and she knows that to live the full social life that she desires, she needs help in getting around.  Naturally, as the film progresses they learn from one another.  At first they are drawn together by her sharp wit and his appreciation of somebody who can speak the truth with a barb and not mince words.  Later they are drawn closer together by their mutual strength of character and the plain fact that she needs a driver and he needs a job.  But finally they are drawn together because they become, as she suddenly observes one day, best friends.This then is a story of love as well--love between two people from different walks of life.  The differences are not just those of race and socio-economic status, or of religion and gender, but of world views and personal psychology, hers demanding and exacting, highbrow and imperial, his practical and easy-going, naturistic and democratic.A tide is turned when her temple is burned to the ground by ""the same ones as always"" as Hoke informs her, which forces Daisy to realize that her enemies are the same as his.  Consequently she attends a speech given by Martin Luther King, Jr.  He prefers to wait outside in the car and listen to it on the radio.  At once we see the commonality of their understanding, but still the differences of their stations in life remain.  The dream and the reality are meshing but slowly, as all things do in the Old South, or, for that matter, most anywhere.See this above all for the captivating performances by Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman, two of the great actors of our time, and for the touching and bittersweet story by Alfred Uhry.  Also noteworthy is director Beresford's careful attention to detail and his unobtrusive guidance so that the film flows as sweetly as Tupelo honey on a warm southern day.",5,Captivating story

94390,A2HIWDD2TDXS19,0790730987,F. Gentile,"[62, 66]","Lovely is such an old fashioned word, I know. But that's the word that describes this film, for me. The story of the developing friendship over many years between the black chaueffeur and the older Jewish woman is very heartwarming in its simplicity. Jessica Tandy is marvelous as &quot;Miss Daisy&quot; the fiercely independant, irascible widow, whose advancing age requires her son to employ, against her wishes, a driver/companion for her. Miss Tandy, who originated the role of Blanche DuBois on Broadway in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, was a wonderful actress. This was one of her last films, and all the skill, sublety, and experience of her life-long craft come together to create a living, breathing &quot;Miss Daisy.&quot; Morgan Freeman meets her skill in his portrayal of &quot;Hoag&quot;, the accomodating chaueffeur. He has the manner of a certain resignation that an older black man may have felt in the turbulent, prejudiced south in which he lived, yet exudes dignity. He has the manner of &quot;Hoag&quot; down pat, right down to the closed mouth laugh that I have seen in the old black men who hang out on the corner. This is not a caricature, he IS &quot;Hoag.&quot; His relationship with Miss Daisy starts out very rocky, to say the least, but, as time passes, their places in each others lives develope into almost a &quot;marriage&quot;, with a quiet understanding of, and dependence on,  each other. And though Miss Daisy insists she was not prejudiced, and inherently wasn't, it is touching to see her slowly let go of her last universally accepted beliefs of peoples place in society, where the &quot;colored&quot; help were always servants of some sort, and the line was just never crossed. Scenes such as the one where she and &quot;Hoag&quot; are both eating their dinner in the house, she in the dining room, he , alone in the kitchen, express this. The very thought of them dining together, it just wasn't done. As time goes on, and she becomes quietly aware of the similarities of the prejudices against her religion and the prejudices and injustice against Hoags race, the differences that seperate them become insignicant.  Dan Akroyd and Patti Lupone are fine as Miss Daisy's son and his typically '50s wife, who admonishes her black maid for the unforgivable sin of forgetting to tell her she was out of coconut for the ambrosia she was serving to her guests... a '50s hostess' nightmare. There are a few moments when their performances threaten to lapse into parody, but one is only aware of this because this is basically a two person play, and the skill and realism of Tandys and Freemans performances just eclipse the others, they are basically props compared to the skill and, yes, sublety of the leads . The exception is Esther Rolle as &quot;Idella&quot; , Miss Daisys black maid. Though her part is small, and her lines few, she manages to convey a resigned dignity also, and her dead-pan delivery of several one liners is very humorous. Miss Daisys affection and respect for Idella is clearly etched upon her face, however, at Idella's funeral. This is just a wonderfully simple, beautiful film. It never treads into being overly sentimental, thanks to the casting of two very special stars. This film took many by surprise by winning the Oscar for best film of the year, proving that a movie with no special effects, and, that actually tells a story, can still move audiences. The final scene, where their years-long friendship comes full circle, will have tears in your eyes, as Miss Daisy conveys the sweet sad wisdom of the old, who know that &quot;all shall soon pass....&quot;",5,Old Friends.,1089936000,"07 16, 2004",2004,3635,"['Lovely', 'such', 'old', 'fashioned', 'word', 'know', 'word', 'film', 'story', 'developing', 'friendship', 'many', 'years', 'black', 'chaueffeur', 'older', 'Jewish', 'woman', 'very', 'heartwarming', 'simplicity', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'marvelous', 'quot', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'quot', 'fiercely', 'independant', 'irascible', 'widow', 'advancing', 'age', 'son', 'employ', 'wishes', 'driver/companion', 'Miss', 'Tandy', 'who', 'originated', 'role', 'Blanche', 'DuBois', 'Broadway', 'quot', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'quot', 'was', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'was', 'one', 'last', 'films', 'skill', 'sublety', 'experience', 'life-long', 'craft', 'come', 'together', 'create', 'living', 'breathing', 'quot', 'Miss', 'Daisy.', 'quot', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'skill', 'portrayal', 'quot', 'Hoag', 'quot', 'accomodating', 'chaueffeur', 'manner', 'certain', 'resignation', 'older', 'black', 'man', 'may', 'have', 'felt', 'turbulent', 'prejudiced', 'south', 'lived', 'yet', 'exudes', 'dignity', 'manner', 'quot', 'Hoag', 'quot', 'down', 'pat', 'right', 'down', 'closed', 'mouth', 'have', 'seen', 'old', 'black', 'men', 'who', 'hang', 'out', 'corner', 'not', 'caricature', 'quot', 'Hoag.', 'quot', 'relationship', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'out', 'very', 'rocky', 'say', 'least', 'time', 'passes', 'places', 'others', 'develope', 'almost', 'quot', 'marriage', 'quot', 'quiet', 'understanding', 'dependence', 'other', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'was', 'not', 'prejudiced', 'inherently', 'was', ""n't"", 'touching', 'see', 'slowly', 'let', 'go', 'last', 'universally', 'accepted', 'beliefs', 'peoples', 'place', 'society', 'where', 'quot', 'colored', 'quot', 'help', 'were', 'always', 'servants', 'sort', 'line', 'was', 'just', 'never', 'crossed', 'Scenes', 'such', 'one', 'where', 'quot', 'Hoag', 'quot', 'are', 'eating', 'dinner', 'house', 'dining', 'room', 'alone', 'kitchen', 'express', 'very', 'thought', 'dining', 'together', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'time', 'quietly', 'aware', 'similarities', 'prejudices', 'religion', 'prejudices', 'injustice', 'Hoags', 'race', 'differences', 'seperate', 'become', 'insignicant', 'Dan', 'Akroyd', 'Patti', 'Lupone', 'are', 'fine', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'son', 'typically', ""'50s"", 'wife', 'who', 'black', 'maid', 'unforgivable', 'sin', 'forgetting', 'tell', 'was', 'coconut', 'ambrosia', 'was', 'serving', 'guests', ""'50s"", 'hostess', 'nightmare', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'when', 'performances', 'threaten', 'lapse', 'parody', 'one', 'only', 'aware', 'basically', 'two', 'person', 'play', 'skill', 'realism', 'Tandys', 'Freemans', 'performances', 'just', 'eclipse', 'others', 'are', 'basically', 'props', 'compared', 'skill', 'yes', 'sublety', 'leads', 'exception', 'Esther', 'Rolle', 'quot', 'Idella', 'quot', 'Miss', 'Daisys', 'black', 'maid', 'part', 'small', 'lines', 'few', 'convey', 'resigned', 'dignity', 'also', 'dead-pan', 'delivery', 'several', 'one', 'liners', 'very', 'humorous', 'Miss', 'Daisys', 'affection', 'respect', 'Idella', 'clearly', 'etched', 'face', 'however', 'Idella', 'funeral', 'just', 'wonderfully', 'simple', 'beautiful', 'film', 'never', 'being', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'thanks', 'casting', 'two', 'very', 'special', 'stars', 'film', 'took', 'many', 'surprise', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'best', 'film', 'year', 'proving', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'actually', 'story', 'can', 'still', 'move', 'audiences', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'years-long', 'friendship', 'full', 'circle', 'will', 'have', 'tears', 'eyes', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'conveys', 'sweet', 'sad', 'wisdom', 'old', 'who', 'know', 'quot', 'shall', 'soon', 'pass', 'quot']",N/A

Other films that would more or less fall into this category include ""Diner"", ""American Grafitti"" and even ""Easy Rider"" as they try to depict a time and a way of life that used to be.  In this sense, ""Driving Miss Daisy"" is a shining light that represents its genre very well.

There are no special features of note though which is the one drawback if you are into making-of documentaries, interviews etc.The story develops slowly but not too slow so as to become boring or tiresome and is a wonderful story of how friendship and mutual respect can grow and develop over time transcending ""barriers"" such as race, colour or creed.  Certainly this is by no means the best ever film to have won the Best Picture Oscar but it is certainly not the worst such as ""Gigi"" and ""Tom Jones"" and unlike those two ""Driving Miss Daisy"" is still a good film in its own right and perhaps ironically the Oscar has become like an albatross around its neck as people have decided to overlook its charms and merits because they have decided to compare this with other previous winners such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or ""Ben Hur"".Great script, great acting and great storytelling makes this a worthy nostalgia genre representative.Recommended.",3,"Pleasant, Nostalgic, Enjoyable if You Are Patient.",1240012800,"04 18, 2009",2009,1629,"['thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'fans', 'genre', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'nostalgia', 'Other', 'films', 'would', 'more', 'less', 'fall', 'category', 'include', 'Diner', 'American', 'Grafitti', 'even', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'try', 'depict', 'time', 'way', 'life', 'used', 'be', 'sense', 'Driving', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'shining', 'light', 'genre', 'very', 'well', 'dvd', 'version', 'got', 'standard', 'version', 'other', 'reviews', 'good', 'thing', 'least', 'get', 'top', 'bottom', 'frames', 'intact', 'apparently', 'sacrficing', 'little', 'sides', 'picture', 'quality', 'also', 'good', 'sound', 'quality', 'decent', 'too', 'coming', 'Dolby', 'Surround', 'Stereo', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'note', 'one', 'drawback', 'are', 'making-of', 'documentaries', 'interviews', 'etc.The', 'story', 'slowly', 'not', 'too', 'slow', 'so', 'become', 'boring', 'tiresome', 'wonderful', 'story', 'how', 'friendship', 'mutual', 'respect', 'can', 'grow', 'develop', 'time', 'transcending', 'barriers', 'such', 'race', 'colour', 'creed', 'Certainly', 'best', 'ever', 'film', 'have', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'certainly', 'not', 'worst', 'such', 'Gigi', 'Tom', 'Jones', 'two', 'Driving', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'still', 'good', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'perhaps', 'ironically', 'Oscar', 'become', 'albatross', 'neck', 'people', 'have', 'decided', 'overlook', 'charms', 'merits', 'have', 'decided', 'compare', 'other', 'previous', 'winners', 'such', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'Ben', 'Hur', '.Great', 'script', 'great', 'acting', 'great', 'storytelling', 'worthy', 'nostalgia', 'genre', 'representative.Recommended']",N/A

The superb Academy Award winning performance of Jessica Tandy as a cantankerous wealthy southern Jewish widow.2. Morgan Freeman's equally superb performance as her good natured but stubborn, intelligent, illiterate chauffeur, Hoke Colburn.3. Dan Aykroyd's portrayal of Miss Daisy's son.  He showed he's capable of more serious acting than ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches.  More importantly, his character shows how an otherwise nice guy caves in to business pressures to be on the wrong side of human rights social change.4. Esther Rolle's performance as Miss Daisy's maid, Idella.  Just as she did in the sit com's Maude and Good Times, she gets in some good one-liners.5. The portrayal of the warming relationship of Miss Daisy and Hoke against the backdrop of the times.  When Miss Daisy sees first-hand the discrimination Hoke suffers as a black man in the south, she increasingly empathizes with him.6. Historical lessons and experience.  Many of us weren't yet born or were too young to remember Jim Crowe law in the South.  With the costuming, cars, kitchen design, etc., I really felt like I stepped back into the years portrayed by the movie--1948, 1953, 1966, etc.7. No on-screen violence.

At the 1989 Writers Guild of America Awards, the movie again won an award in the Best Adapted Screenplay category.

94412,A2YNT4QDEQX30F,0790730987,H. Snyder,"[0, 0]","Covering a span of twenty years in the American South from just after World War II through the tumultuous years of the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, Driving Miss Daisy tells the story of an elderly Jewish widow and retired teacher (Jessica Tandy), her businessman son (Dan Aykroyd) and her chauffeur (Morgan Freeman). Instead of the strident account it could have been, Driving Miss Daisy slowly, carefully, lovingly follows the evolving relationship between a patrician old woman whose actions do not always match her professed beliefs, and a servant whose grace and patience win out over time. And it all starts with the week it took to convince Miss Daisy to climb into the car for a drive to the Piggly Wiggly grocery store.Jessica Tandy capped a distinguished career by winning the Academy Award for Best Actress in Driving Miss Daisy, which also took the award for Best Picture. The Blu-ray is a bit soft-focus, but that might have been the intent of cinematographer Peter James, as it fits both the mood of the film and Atlanta's warm and humid environment. In any event, the softness is not detrimental to enjoyment of the film.With great character development and spot-on performances by the cast, Driving Miss Daisy is an example of ""old"" Hollywood, taking time to tell a story about people you can care about, and without polemics that require choosing sides. That it was a box office smash and Best Picture of the year only goes to show that the public mood in the late 1980s was accepting of a quiet and low-key presentation, as long as it was a good story well told.

Georgia is starting to finally find its new dynamism in industry, and no longer only  in cultivating cotton. This new industrial age of the South is very carefully depicted through the Jewish Miss Daisy and her son, and the Black driver Miss daisy finally needs and accepts in her old age. The complicity of the two characters confronted to the genteel southern society that is evolving into something more modern, confronted to the emancipation of the Blacks through the Civil Right Movement and the impact of Martin Luther King's fight is touching and immensely heartwarming. We are little by little convinced that humanity, in spite of all its evil acts and behaviours, is respectable and even encouraging. The march towards more equality, towards the emancipation of Blacks, women, men and all those who are in a way or another submitted to some limitations, cannot ever be stopped by any bigotry or antagonism. Humanity can free itself of all its evil deeds and thoughts by mere historical evolution and deep human feelings. Love is the key to many evil situations and respect of others is the skeleton key to all difficult situations. Jessica Tandy is outstanding in her performance, but so is Morgan Freeman and the film is giving to the car a role to play that is amazing for a simple object, though it is the very acme of American freedom and civilization.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Life is a long evolution,1012262400,"01 29, 2002",2002,1511,"['film', 'Georgia', '1950s', '1960s', 'surprising', 'formula', 'used', 'ambition', 'demonstrated', 'along', 'Georgia', 'starting', 'finally', 'find', 'new', 'dynamism', 'industry', 'no', 'longer', 'only', 'cultivating', 'cotton', 'new', 'industrial', 'age', 'South', 'very', 'carefully', 'depicted', 'Jewish', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'son', 'Black', 'driver', 'Miss', 'daisy', 'finally', 'accepts', 'old', 'age', 'complicity', 'two', 'characters', 'confronted', 'genteel', 'southern', 'society', 'evolving', 'something', 'more', 'modern', 'confronted', 'emancipation', 'Blacks', 'Civil', 'Right', 'Movement', 'impact', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'fight', 'touching', 'immensely', 'heartwarming', 'are', 'little', 'little', 'convinced', 'humanity', 'spite', 'evil', 'acts', 'behaviours', 'respectable', 'even', 'encouraging', 'march', 'more', 'equality', 'emancipation', 'Blacks', 'women', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'way', 'submitted', 'limitations', 'can', 'not', 'ever', 'be', 'stopped', 'bigotry', 'antagonism', 'Humanity', 'can', 'free', 'evil', 'deeds', 'thoughts', 'mere', 'historical', 'evolution', 'deep', 'human', 'feelings', 'Love', 'key', 'many', 'evil', 'situations', 'respect', 'others', 'skeleton', 'key', 'difficult', 'situations', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'so', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'film', 'giving', 'car', 'role', 'play', 'amazing', 'simple', 'object', 'very', 'acme', 'American', 'freedom', 'civilization.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

Tandy received the Oscar (she was then 81 years old), and Freeman was nominated as Best Actor but denied the statuette he deserved, which was surprisingly awarded to Daniel Day Lewis for a now-obscure film ""My Left Foot."" ""Driving"" was nominated for eight Oscars, and was winner for Best Film, Actress, Adapted screenplay, and makeup.There are no chase scenes, supernatural twists or mind-boggling special effects - just first-rate writing, scripting, directing, acting, editing and mixing. The director, Bruce Beresford, is almost invisible as he guides the tale, and many were shocked that he was not nominated for Best Director by the Oscar committee.""Driving"" Ranks with ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" for salient content and historical import, but this is no courtroom drama - it's the story of a doctor's wealthy widow, Jewish of faith and riddled with racial bigotry, and hhow she gradually and reluctantly evolves. She is an allegory for the South - indeed, for the USA, and Tandy pulls it off with a finesse that leaves the viewer in awe.

94421,AWA0CA9AYL5YQ,0790730987,Jennifer Litchfield,"[1, 1]","Driving Miss Daisy is a classic example of why a movie doesn't need a shoot 'em up action sequence, or the usual obligatory sex scene, in order to enthrall and captivate. Despite the fact that the story covers a 25-year period in just over an hour and a half, it isn't a movie that rushes the viewer. Instead it proceeds at the comfortable pace of the southern-USA drawl characteristic of its Georgia setting. Unfortunately for those who are unused to this particular accent, at times it is difficult to make out what is being said. The unhurried feeling created is complemented by an excellent musical score - simple, light and almost whimsical, with a very catchy refrain.The film follows the relationship (it would be too simplistic merely to call it friendship) between a widowed Jewish lady, Daisy Werthan, and her black chauffeur Hoke. Miss Daisy is adamant she neither wants nor needs the driver, provided by her exasperated son to ensure she doesn't have any more car accidents. However, over the next quarter century her frostiness thaws (albeit sporadically) and an understanding develops between this unlikely pair.Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman well deserve the accolades they have received for their roles in this film. These talented actors have to share the limelight though - with a truly magnificent classic car ensemble. If you think modern cars are boring, it is worth viewing this film merely for the pleasure of seeing Miss Daisy's succession of cars - beautiful classic models from the late 1940s to the early 1970s - a time when cars truly deserved the title 'automobile'.",5,"""I just love the smell of a new car, don't you Miss Daisy?""",1022630400,"05 29, 2002",2002,1597,"['Driving', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'classic', 'example', 'why', 'movie', ""n't"", 'need', 'shoot', 'up', 'action', 'sequence', 'usual', 'obligatory', 'sex', 'scene', 'order', 'enthrall', 'captivate', 'fact', 'story', '25-year', 'period', 'just', 'hour', 'half', ""n't"", 'movie', 'viewer', 'Instead', 'comfortable', 'pace', 'southern-USA', 'drawl', 'characteristic', 'Georgia', 'setting', 'Unfortunately', 'who', 'are', 'unused', 'particular', 'accent', 'times', 'difficult', 'make', 'out', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'unhurried', 'feeling', 'created', 'complemented', 'excellent', 'musical', 'score', 'simple', 'light', 'almost', 'whimsical', 'very', 'catchy', 'refrain.The', 'film', 'relationship', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'simplistic', 'merely', 'call', 'friendship', 'widowed', 'Jewish', 'lady', 'Daisy', 'Werthan', 'black', 'chauffeur', 'Hoke', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'adamant', 'driver', 'provided', 'exasperated', 'son', 'ensure', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', 'car', 'accidents', 'However', 'next', 'quarter', 'century', 'frostiness', 'thaws', 'sporadically', 'understanding', 'develops', 'unlikely', 'pair.Jessica', 'Tandy', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'well', 'deserve', 'accolades', 'have', 'received', 'roles', 'film', 'talented', 'actors', 'have', 'share', 'limelight', 'truly', 'magnificent', 'classic', 'car', 'ensemble', 'think', 'modern', 'cars', 'are', 'boring', 'worth', 'viewing', 'film', 'merely', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'succession', 'cars', 'beautiful', 'classic', 'models', 'late', '1940s', 'early', '1970s', 'time', 'when', 'cars', 'truly', 'deserved', 'title']",N/A

Whatever the case is, ""Driving Miss Daisy"" is a masterpiece and a very uplifting film. Jessica Tandy (who won an Oscar for the role) plays Miss Daisy, a stubborn old woman that is no longer allowed to drive after forgetting to push down on the brake. Her son, Boolie (Dan Aykroyd) hires a chauffeur for his resistant mother but she claims she doesn't need one, saying it's the cars fault for her accident. Problem is, her chauffeur is Hoke (Morgan Freeman, in one of his most beloved roles) who refuses to give in. From the beginning of the film, we love Hoke and despise Miss Daisy for being so rude to him. By the end of the film, we still love Hoke and have found ourselves falling in love with Miss Daisy. The final scene(s) of the film are the most touching and brilliantly written. It's one of the final scenes (""You're my best friend, Hoke"") that is one of the most endlessly parodied. What I don't get it is that one of the most parodied films of all time (""The Godfather"") still is considered a masterpiece. Don't get me wrong, I'm not putting this film in the same league with ""The Godfather"" but I think this film does deserve more recognition. Tandy and Freeman are just wonderful, as is Aykroyd in one of his most memorable roles (keep in mind, this is a man whose recent acting roles include a role in the Britney Spears-vehicle ""Crossroads""). As I said, this film receives little to no critical accolades but I think that more people will remember this film over a period of time than say ""Yankee Doodle Dandy.""

The image was cropped, softly focused and absent of fine details and proper color balancing.  Now, Warner has gone back to the drawing board and released &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; in its original 1:85:1 aspect ratio.  But this still may not be the version for you to run out and buy.True, the original theatrical release was rather softly focused, but this edition is perhaps too much so in spots to say that it is the result of the director's original intent.  Colors are smeared and contrast levels continue to be extremely low in spots.  There are also blemishes in the original camera negative that are quite evident, particularly in the scenes that take place in the kitchen. Also, there is quite a bit of digital grit, evident in scenes with a lot of sky and a ton of pixelization that breaks up fine background details.

When I found in recently on the shelf of the library, I tried it.  I still found it awfully predictable.  You could look at the cover picture and see the whole story on it.  It took me two nights to get through it, however it was worth it, if only to get to the final scene.  That scene, in the nursing home with Morgan Freeman (Hoke) feeding pumpkin pie to Jessica Tandy (Miss Daisy) will rest in my mind as one of the loveliest scenes in the history of film.  I did find Ms. Tandy's performance rather one-noted for most of the film---the cranky old woman who complains about everything.  If it hadn't been for Morgan Freeman's wonderful presence I might have sent the DVD back to the library, unfinished.  He is pure delight---As another review mentioned, he is the epitome of what a Christian should be---long-suffering, returning good for evil (over and over and over!)---an overcomer who brings warmth again to the stony heart of an old woman.  As sweet as he is, he is also quite handsome---great dimples!---and very funny.  It's definitely worth wading through the many minutes of tiresome Miss Tandy to see Mr. Freeman and I agree with others that he, not she should have been the Oscar winner.  Dan Ackroyd was a pleasant surprise.  I found myself brightening up when he came on screen and I'd had too much of Miss Daisy.  Esther Rolle does a terrific job as the monosyllabic housekeeper who has found her own way of coping with Miss Daisy.  Patty Lupone is great, too, as the social climbing daughter-in-law, who irritates Miss. Daisy.  I would have liked to see more of her.  The sets are lovely.

94509,ASJ89T42CIUHU,0790730987,V. Marshall,"[4, 4]","This film from 1989 is an absolute timeless gem. Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman give stunningly sensitive performances as a Southern Jewish woman and her Negro chauffer during the most racist of times in America.The characters in this film are filled with depth and an openness that allows them to be touchable by all classes of people. Living in the Deep South Miss Daisy begins to lose her ability to drive and her son hires a poor black man to be her devoted chauffer. The relationship between these two very different people results in a 25 year long friendship. The story has been adapted skillfully from a play into this extraordinary film well worth watching time and again.Jessica Tandy won an Oscar for her role as Daisy Werthan, a widowed Jewish woman. She comes across distant and harsh at first but viewers soon learn she is just protecting her fear and lack of confidence. She is funny at times and vulnerable at others but entirely well-rounded and likable. The old school teacher mentality dies slowly in Miss Daisy and she bosses people around like crazy, reminding those of us familiar with old southern women who wears the pants. As Daisy ages her circumstances begin to change and she must rely on those who have surrounded her as loyal servants and family. But her strength lies hidden in the scenes where she teaches Hoke to read and where she discovers the true loyalty of her faithful friend/chauffer along with her encouragement as she listens to the Martin Luther King Jr. speech.As Hoke, the loyal chauffer, Morgan Freeman shines! He is humble, patient and compassionate in his role as Miss Daisy's driver. Hoke treats Miss Daisy with respect but he also has no qualms about putting her in her place every now and then. He relates to her during scenes where the two of them face racism from the good ole boy white police, a Jew and a colored man in the old south...imagine that! Because of the brilliance with which Freeman plays Hoke, we are able to imagine what it must have taken to endure during such an evil time. Freeman ages along with Tandy and the 25 year old friendship lasts throughout the years without faltering.Not short on talent are supporting actors, Dan Aykroyd and Esther Rolle. Aykroyd plays Miss Daisy's son, Boolie, with tremendous Southern character. Esther Rolle is Miss Daisy's housekeeper who loyally grumbles along behind Miss Daisy's back with a great sense of humor as only Esther Rolle was capable of. Films with great supporting members are often few and far between but thankfully this film only deepens in meaning because of these two great actors.This film is fantastic in many ways but most especially in how it brings to light the fear involved in aging and losing the functions of individual independence. Racism is graced upon and passed over as it should have done in real life allowing people to just be people and not a color or creed. The message remains timeless, that true friendships endure the harshest of circumstances and changes with the times surpassing all of the stupid prejudices that society conjures up.",5,Driving Home a Timeless Classic,1092009600,"08 9, 2004",2004,3086,"['film', '1989', 'absolute', 'timeless', 'gem', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'give', 'stunningly', 'sensitive', 'performances', 'Southern', 'Jewish', 'woman', 'Negro', 'chauffer', 'most', 'racist', 'times', 'America.The', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'filled', 'depth', 'openness', 'be', 'touchable', 'classes', 'people', 'Living', 'Deep', 'South', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'lose', 'ability', 'drive', 'son', 'poor', 'black', 'man', 'be', 'devoted', 'chauffer', 'relationship', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'people', 'results', '25', 'year', 'long', 'friendship', 'story', 'been', 'adapted', 'skillfully', 'play', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'well', 'watching', 'time', 'again.Jessica', 'Tandy', 'won', 'Oscar', 'role', 'Daisy', 'Werthan', 'widowed', 'Jewish', 'woman', 'distant', 'harsh', 'first', 'viewers', 'soon', 'learn', 'just', 'protecting', 'fear', 'lack', 'confidence', 'funny', 'times', 'vulnerable', 'others', 'entirely', 'well-rounded', 'likable', 'old', 'school', 'teacher', 'mentality', 'slowly', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'people', 'crazy', 'reminding', 'familiar', 'old', 'southern', 'women', 'who', 'wears', 'pants', 'Daisy', 'circumstances', 'begin', 'change', 'must', 'rely', 'who', 'have', 'surrounded', 'loyal', 'servants', 'family', 'strength', 'hidden', 'scenes', 'where', 'Hoke', 'read', 'where', 'true', 'loyalty', 'faithful', 'friend/chauffer', 'encouragement', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Jr.', 'speech.As', 'Hoke', 'loyal', 'chauffer', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'humble', 'patient', 'compassionate', 'role', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'driver', 'Hoke', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'respect', 'also', 'qualms', 'putting', 'place', 'now', 'then', 'scenes', 'where', 'two', 'face', 'racism', 'good', 'ole', 'white', 'police', 'Jew', 'colored', 'man', 'old', 'south', 'imagine', 'brilliance', 'Freeman', 'Hoke', 'are', 'able', 'imagine', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'taken', 'endure', 'such', 'evil', 'time', 'Freeman', 'Tandy', '25', 'year', 'old', 'friendship', 'years', 'faltering.Not', 'short', 'talent', 'are', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'Esther', 'Rolle', 'Aykroyd', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'son', 'Boolie', 'tremendous', 'Southern', 'character', 'Esther', 'Rolle', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'housekeeper', 'who', 'loyally', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'back', 'great', 'sense', 'humor', 'only', 'Esther', 'Rolle', 'was', 'capable', 'Films', 'great', 'supporting', 'members', 'are', 'often', 'few', 'far', 'thankfully', 'film', 'only', 'meaning', 'two', 'great', 'actors.This', 'film', 'fantastic', 'many', 'ways', 'most', 'especially', 'how', 'light', 'fear', 'involved', 'aging', 'losing', 'functions', 'individual', 'independence', 'Racism', 'graced', 'passed', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'real', 'life', 'allowing', 'people', 'just', 'be', 'people', 'not', 'color', 'creed', 'message', 'timeless', 'true', 'friendships', 'endure', 'harshest', 'circumstances', 'changes', 'times', 'surpassing', 'stupid', 'prejudices', 'society', 'up']",N/A

The story is simple:  After accidentally backing her car over a small embankment, Daisy Werthan's son, Boolie, decides it best if a chauffeur was hired to drive her. Fearing a loss of independence, she refuses to allow herself to become friends with Hoke Colburn, an african-american man hired by Boolie.  But after a series of events, including the death of her cook, Idella, played by Esther Rolle, and the burning down of their synagogue, she realizes that it's not a loss of independence that she feared most, but the fact that through all that happened, she found herself liking this black man with whom she ends up sharing twenty-some years with.
