And unfortunately that's pretty much what happens here. ""Botched"" shoots for that comedy/horror genre that's so hard to nail and it falls short on both counts. In the story a professional thief is sent to Russia to steal a specific artifact from the penthouse apartment of a large building. Things go badly and the thief (Played by Stephen Dorff.), his two associates and a group of hostages find themselves trapped in the seemingly abandoned 13th floor of the building. Then people start to die. It's not a brilliant setup but it's not awful either and there's plenty of blood and gore (Although some of the gore is just gross.) so you had the potential here for a pretty watchable movie. Unfortunately the scary part isn't scary and the funny part isn't funny. And while you can sometimes get away with a horror movie that's not scary, bad comedy and ""quirky"" characters that don't work are mind killers. I gave this two stars because the actors are all game snd do their best with what they have to work with. And honestly because I don't know why this was so bad. It should have been funnier.

1147005,A3TY1C8ZHY5THP,B0014FAIYI,"Inept Editor ""TheIneptOwl.com""","[1, 1]","I like to think of myself as a fair appraiser of movies. I try to take movies as they are when giving to, or taking from, their merit, and not what I think they should have been. In all fairness, you can't judge a movie like The Shawshank Redemption on its comedic intent rather than dramatic effect anymore than you can judge Thomas The Tank Engine based on how many dismemberments and T&A; shots there were. It's not fair to the film.However, upon watching Stephen Dorff's Botched, I think I am being fair when I say that this was a horrible script surrounded by a great cast and intense execution. What does that really mean? I'm not too sure, but I'll sure as hell try to explain it.Botched, directed by newcomer Kit Ryan and written by Derek Boyle, Eamon Friel, and Raymond Friel,  introduces us to Ritchie Donovan, a professional thief with a streak of bad luck(played by Stephen Dorff of SFW and Blade fame). Our first contact with Ritchie displays a twice-bumbled jewel heist, of which Ritchie's employer, probable Russian mob boss Mr. Groznyi, is quite unhappy with. To redeem himself, Ritchie is given one last job, to steal a cross from a family living on the penthouse floor of a building in Moscow. With the help of brothers Peter and Yuri, the job goes bad, and the three felons are caught on the 13th floor(inferred) of the building with a group of apparently innocent bystanders, a security guard, and some Dungeons & Dragons fanatic with a real sword.Hilarity ensues. Or at least is supposed to.I will be fair: this film never asks to be taken seriously. There are a few memorable scenes that make sure we remember this, one which includes the use of disco lights and music, another at the end that almost makes the whole movie worthwhile. Geoff Bell, Jamie Foreman, and Hugh O'Conor all put on excellent comedic performances when they are needed, even if it is to smooth the edges of Stephen Dorff, who has a knack for turning anything remotely funny into melancholy drama. Not that that's always a bad thing, but in this movie, it doesn't work all that well. This movie has no serious intent, Stephen, so there is no need to try to make this an Oscar-worthy performance.The problem with this movie is incoherence mixed with NOT ENOUGH FUNNY. Incoherent is only as funny as the running gag jokes that give the movie its script. Of course, sometimes too much funny incoherence can be bad(see Scary Movie 2-4, Superhero Movie, Meet The Spartans, Disaster Movie for references). Botched doesn't give us enough funny, and with a feeble script limping along, it just doesn't make the cut. Sure, there's some nice, gruesome gore in the film, but even those moments of horror are few and far between, which makes it a tough sell when going up against movies like Frontier(s) and Otis",2,Woops,1262044800,"12 29, 2009",2009,2794,"['like', 'think', 'fair', 'appraiser', 'movies', 'try', 'take', 'movies', 'are', 'when', 'giving', 'taking', 'merit', 'not', 'what', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'fairness', 'ca', ""n't"", 'judge', 'movie', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'comedic', 'intent', 'rather', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'anymore', 'can', 'judge', 'Thomas', 'Tank', 'Engine', 'based', 'how', 'many', 'dismemberments', 'T', 'A', 'shots', 'were', 'not', 'fair', 'film.However', 'watching', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'Botched', 'think', 'am', 'being', 'fair', 'when', 'say', 'was', 'horrible', 'script', 'surrounded', 'great', 'cast', 'intense', 'execution', 'What', 'really', 'mean', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'sure', 'hell', 'try', 'explain', 'it.Botched', 'directed', 'newcomer', 'Kit', 'Ryan', 'written', 'Derek', 'Boyle', 'Eamon', 'Friel', 'Raymond', 'Friel', 'Ritchie', 'Donovan', 'professional', 'thief', 'streak', 'bad', 'luck', 'played', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'SFW', 'Blade', 'fame', 'first', 'contact', 'Ritchie', 'twice-bumbled', 'jewel', 'heist', 'Ritchie', 'employer', 'probable', 'Russian', 'mob', 'Mr.', 'Groznyi', 'quite', 'unhappy', 'redeem', 'Ritchie', 'given', 'one', 'last', 'job', 'steal', 'cross', 'family', 'living', 'penthouse', 'floor', 'building', 'Moscow', 'help', 'brothers', 'Peter', 'Yuri', 'job', 'bad', 'three', 'felons', 'are', 'caught', '13th', 'floor', 'inferred', 'building', 'group', 'apparently', 'innocent', 'bystanders', 'security', 'guard', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'fanatic', 'real', 'sword.Hilarity', 'ensues', 'least', 'supposed', 'to.I', 'will', 'be', 'fair', 'film', 'never', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'are', 'few', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'make', 'sure', 'remember', 'one', 'use', 'disco', 'lights', 'music', 'end', 'almost', 'whole', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'Geoff', 'Bell', 'Jamie', 'Foreman', 'Hugh', ""O'Conor"", 'all', 'put', 'excellent', 'comedic', 'performances', 'when', 'are', 'needed', 'even', 'smooth', 'edges', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'who', 'knack', 'turning', 'anything', 'remotely', 'funny', 'melancholy', 'drama', 'Not', 'always', 'bad', 'thing', 'movie', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'movie', 'serious', 'intent', 'Stephen', 'need', 'try', 'make', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance.The', 'problem', 'movie', 'incoherence', 'mixed', 'NOT', 'ENOUGH', 'FUNNY', 'Incoherent', 'only', 'as', 'funny', 'running', 'gag', 'jokes', 'give', 'movie', 'script', 'course', 'sometimes', 'too', 'much', 'funny', 'incoherence', 'can', 'be', 'bad', 'see', 'Scary', 'Movie', '2-4', 'Superhero', 'Movie', 'Meet', 'Spartans', 'Disaster', 'Movie', 'references', 'Botched', ""n't"", 'give', 'enough', 'funny', 'feeble', 'script', 'limping', 'along', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'cut', 'Sure', 'nice', 'gruesome', 'gore', 'film', 'even', 'moments', 'horror', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'tough', 'sell', 'when', 'going', 'up', 'movies', 'Frontier', 's']",Botched

Inside a luxurious penthouse the caper goes awry.  Teamed with the Russian version of Laurel and Hardy, Ritchie and the group is trapped on an undeveloped floor with a psycho who is equally involved in LARPing, ballet, and murder.The most unfortunate aspect of Botched is the title describes the execution.  It's a poor attempt at the horror/comedy blend where the horror isn't scary and the comedy isn't funny.  Throw in disco lights and a few Scooby Doo chase scenes to make it worse.  I'd be remiss if I didn't mention an atrocious, tone-def, misfiring score.  It's Addam's Family, carnival, Italian restaurant, Benny Hill, and Tetris theme song all rolled into one.  Worst score in movie history.For whatever reason the movie is set in Russia, where all of the actors aside from the perpetually dramatic Dorff butcher Russian accents filled with inaccuracies and inconsistencies.  Speaking of butchering, look for the Ed Gein inspired wallpaper midway through the film; it's the fraction that's even remotely creepy.  As for funny, there's a cheap fart scene.

I have no idea where the comparison between the two movies comes from other than there was blood in both movies and both movies were funny.Botched is the story of Ritchie, a two-bit thief who gets sent to Russia to retrieve an artifact from a penthouse suite to pay to pay off the debt he owes to a local L.A. Russian crime boss. Sounds simple enough, but in Botched, what can go wrong, does go wrong, and everything leads to (almost) hilarity which explains the title.There's not a lot of plot here beyond what I mentioned above. Ritchie gets paired with a hapless local duo and after successfully retrieving the artifact, he and his partners, and an assorted group of office workers making their way down to the lobby, get stuck on the building's 13th floor. Slowly the realization of their situation dawns on Ritchie and the rest of the movie involves him trying to, I guess un-botch, his, and the office worker's sticky situation.The movie is bloody and not without humor and I was entertained for 94 minutes which is pretty much all I could ask for. With the exception of Stephen Dorff it looks as if the rest of the cast are all from the UK so I don't know why they set the story in Russia and made everyone speak with Russian accents?

It's a quirky, silly horror-comedy so if you expect something serious then you don't need to bother with this film.Botched is about an American thief in Russia (Stephen Dorff) who teams up with two Russian brothers to rob a highrise. They soon get trapped by who they think are the cops but when heads starting flying off and people start getting hacked they realize they've made a mistake.While trying to devise a plan of escape the three robbers meet up with an elevator of people who they take hostage. After that some of the hostages are picked off one by one by a crazed barbarian serial killer and from there this cute comedy springs some surprising and hilarious twists.I was shocked I enjoyed this movie because I didn't expect much. I love to laugh and this film got some good chuckles from me. It's not award-winning material of course but it keeps you entertained. This is one of those films just to watch to pass the time. I caught it on cable and if something better had been on I wouldn't have watched it but being a Stephen Dorff fan (even though his movies are horrible), I gave it a try.Anyone who has followed Dorff's career might agree that Botched is definitely not one of his worst films. In fact it's the best he's made in a while. I loved seeing him in a comedic role. He has a sort of sexy, dry humor thing happening and maybe he should venture more into comedy from now on.The movie is fast-paced and the characters are all interesting. Some are stereotypical but that's the beauty of them.So if you're looking for a film that's sure to be a little fun then Botched might be up your alley. Just don't expect too much.",3,Don't Bother if You Don't Have a Sense of Humor,1342051200,"07 12, 2012",2012,1692,"['First', 'movie', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'quirky', 'silly', 'horror-comedy', 'so', 'expect', 'something', 'serious', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'bother', 'film.Botched', 'American', 'thief', 'Russia', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'who', 'teams', 'up', 'two', 'Russian', 'brothers', 'rob', 'highrise', 'soon', 'get', 'trapped', 'who', 'think', 'are', 'cops', 'when', 'heads', 'starting', 'flying', 'off', 'people', 'start', 'getting', 'hacked', 'realize', ""'ve"", 'made', 'mistake.While', 'trying', 'devise', 'plan', 'escape', 'three', 'robbers', 'meet', 'up', 'elevator', 'people', 'who', 'take', 'hostage', 'hostages', 'are', 'picked', 'one', 'one', 'crazed', 'barbarian', 'serial', 'killer', 'cute', 'comedy', 'springs', 'surprising', 'hilarious', 'twists.I', 'was', 'shocked', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'love', 'laugh', 'film', 'got', 'good', 'chuckles', 'not', 'award-winning', 'material', 'course', 'entertained', 'one', 'films', 'just', 'watch', 'pass', 'time', 'caught', 'cable', 'something', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'watched', 'being', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'fan', 'even', 'movies', 'are', 'horrible', 'gave', 'try.Anyone', 'who', 'followed', 'Dorff', 'career', 'might', 'agree', 'Botched', 'definitely', 'not', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'fact', 'best', 'made', 'while', 'loved', 'seeing', 'comedic', 'role', 'sort', 'sexy', 'dry', 'humor', 'thing', 'happening', 'maybe', 'should', 'venture', 'more', 'comedy', 'now', 'on.The', 'movie', 'fast-paced', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'are', 'stereotypical', 'beauty', 'them.So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'film', 'sure', 'be', 'little', 'fun', 'then', 'Botched', 'might', 'be', 'up', 'alley', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much']",Botched
1147012,A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE,B0014FAIYI,"Ravenskya ""Princess of Horror""","[3, 4]","This movie starts out really well, I was excited, interested and engaged... then it sank into a quagmire of trying too hard to be funny.  The opening felt like your typical mob/crime film then we get to the horror/comedy part and everything went so way over the top that it felt like a student film.The premise, a couple of thieves steal a golden cross at the request of their crime boss, then during their getaway get stuck in the building with a serial killer, some crazies, a loony security guard, and an assortment of whiny bad guy fodder.  True some of the gore was GREAT, I wasn't thrilled with one of the decapitation scenes, but the rest of the gore was spot on.  The problem was that the premise got old quickly and the movie starts becoming reminiscent of that old 80's film ""Clue"" with Tim Currey.  Now I loved ""Clue"" but it also didn't contain a random man dressed up like a barbarian, wielding a sword through the hallways of a high rise.I have heard this movie compared to ""Fido"" ""Black Sheep"" and the like, but sadly I feel that this movie attempted to go there, but never made it.  Rather than funny, it was silly, and failed on all attempts by the time you get to the end.Now I suppose if you are REALLY drunk, this movie might be funny.
