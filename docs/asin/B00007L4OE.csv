And her male co-star...well let's just say if I was stuck on a deserted island with him, I kiss his feet and do his laundry too.

731310,AHSY48775P8RI,B00007L4OE,Avalon Daughter,"[31, 37]","Alright, first thing I'm going to do is establish my credibility. Yes, I have been a Madonna fan since 1983 and NO I do not think everything she makes is fantastic which I find annoying and cultish (you know, that glazed eyed look of her fanatic fans.) In fact, she's put out some real doozies (ahem... ""Next Best Thing"" anyone? What garbage!) Plus, I hated her album ""Music"" so this is to let you know I'm trying to be a fair viewer.Okay, the movie. Well, I watched it out of morbid curiosity. I had heard so much bad stuff about this movie I just really wanted to see why it was so horrible. You know what? It wasn't that bad.The storyline was somewhat interesting... fascinating really... take two opposite persons with different morals and values that defy the other and put each one in a place of power over the other and watch what happens. It is somewhat masochistic in a sense. In other words, it really is a clashing of personal values and  defying them until the other gets fed up. The lower class Italian worker simply rebels more and more when he is being dominated by Amber... interestingly enough, Amber, the rich nasty woman, submits completely when she is in the passive position. She really doesn't even fight. Why? Because her place of power really is an illusion whereas his isn't.Regardless, all philosophical musings aside, you probably want the dirt on the flick. Alright, it's totally Guy all the way when it comes to filming and directing. You get his humor and camera angles from ""Lock, Stock..."" So if you liked that movie, you might get a kick out of this one.How was Madonna? Not bad. She was actually interesting in her character. She's starting to really loosen as an actress and beginning to forget the camera. Remember, I said BEGINNING.She's getting there. Also, it seems like she trusts her husband as a director so she relaxes a bit. She delivers her lines softer, but without as much emotion in the first half of the film. I truly believe Madonna should take acting lessons. She's too conscious of the camera and we as the audience are too conscious of the most famous woman in the world. And she's aware of this.Is this a problem? Yes, mostly due to the fact that she has a HUGE obstacle to overcome in order for her audience to believe her as an actress; she has to make her audience forget who she is in order for them to like her character that she's portraying. She did this 100% in ""Desperately Seeking Susan"" and 75% in ""Evita.""If she took lessons in acting, like she did with singing, I think she could go somewhere. Otherwise, her marketable product is what's truly knocking her down. What an amazing contradition!Otherwise, the film was interesting. The scenery was just beautiful, especially the nighttime scenes. There are moments between the two main characters that are genuinely fun and tender. I liked the interaction between the two of them and how loving they are towards each other. The ending (Spoiler)  is truly sad which makes it more of an art film than a blockbuster movie.  However, you can tell it was put together rather quickly and could have used more polishing.  Not a waste, but not that bad.Still, I plan on renting it when it comes out. I wouldn't mind looking at it again. Recommendations: big bang viewers, don't bother -- it's more of an insight to an artflick, something to chat about.",3,More Art Film than Crowd Pleaser,1041811200,"01 6, 2003",2003,3358,"['Alright', 'first', 'thing', ""'m"", 'going', 'do', 'establish', 'credibility', 'Yes', 'have', 'been', 'Madonna', 'fan', '1983', 'NO', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'everything', 'fantastic', 'find', 'annoying', 'cultish', 'know', 'glazed', 'eyed', 'look', 'fanatic', 'fans', 'fact', 'put', 'out', 'real', 'doozies', 'ahem', 'Next', 'Best', 'Thing', 'anyone', 'What', 'garbage', 'hated', 'album', 'Music', 'let', 'know', ""'m"", 'trying', 'be', 'fair', 'viewer.Okay', 'movie', 'Well', 'watched', 'morbid', 'curiosity', 'had', 'heard', 'so', 'much', 'bad', 'stuff', 'movie', 'just', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'horrible', 'know', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad.The', 'storyline', 'was', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'fascinating', 'really', 'take', 'two', 'opposite', 'persons', 'different', 'morals', 'values', 'defy', 'other', 'put', 'one', 'place', 'power', 'other', 'watch', 'what', 'somewhat', 'masochistic', 'sense', 'other', 'words', 'really', 'clashing', 'personal', 'values', 'defying', 'other', 'fed', 'up', 'lower', 'class', 'Italian', 'worker', 'simply', 'more', 'more', 'when', 'being', 'dominated', 'Amber', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'Amber', 'rich', 'nasty', 'woman', 'submits', 'completely', 'when', 'passive', 'position', 'really', ""n't"", 'even', 'fight', 'Why', 'place', 'power', 'really', 'illusion', ""isn't.Regardless"", 'philosophical', 'musings', 'aside', 'probably', 'want', 'dirt', 'flick', 'Alright', 'totally', 'Guy', 'way', 'when', 'filming', 'directing', 'get', 'humor', 'camera', 'angles', 'Lock', 'Stock', 'liked', 'movie', 'might', 'get', 'kick', 'one.How', 'was', 'Madonna', 'Not', 'bad', 'was', 'actually', 'interesting', 'character', 'starting', 'really', 'loosen', 'actress', 'beginning', 'forget', 'camera', 'Remember', 'said', 'BEGINNING.She', 'getting', 'there', 'Also', 'husband', 'director', 'bit', 'lines', 'softer', 'as', 'much', 'emotion', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'truly', 'believe', 'Madonna', 'should', 'take', 'acting', 'lessons', 'too', 'conscious', 'camera', 'audience', 'are', 'too', 'conscious', 'most', 'famous', 'woman', 'world', 'aware', 'this.Is', 'problem', 'Yes', 'mostly', 'due', 'fact', 'HUGE', 'obstacle', 'overcome', 'order', 'audience', 'believe', 'actress', 'make', 'audience', 'forget', 'who', 'order', 'like', 'character', 'portraying', 'did', '100', '%', 'Desperately', 'Seeking', 'Susan', '75', '%', 'Evita', 'took', 'lessons', 'acting', 'did', 'singing', 'think', 'could', 'go', 'somewhere', 'Otherwise', 'marketable', 'product', 'what', 'truly', 'knocking', 'down', 'What', 'amazing', 'contradition', 'Otherwise', 'film', 'was', 'interesting', 'scenery', 'was', 'just', 'beautiful', 'especially', 'nighttime', 'scenes', 'are', 'moments', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'genuinely', 'fun', 'tender', 'liked', 'interaction', 'two', 'how', 'loving', 'are', 'towards', 'other', 'ending', 'Spoiler', 'truly', 'sad', 'more', 'art', 'film', 'blockbuster', 'movie', 'However', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'rather', 'quickly', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'polishing', 'Not', 'waste', 'not', 'bad.Still', 'plan', 'renting', 'when', 'out', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'looking', 'again', 'Recommendations', 'big', 'bang', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'more', 'insight', 'artflick', 'something', 'chat']",Swept Away

Her movies, not so much, except for Desperately Seeking Susan. But I'd seen the original movie Swept Away was based on (Lina Wertmuller: check her work out), and was intrigued enough to see another Madonna movie. But this was plain terrible. It's not a faithful remake (with a different ending, more soap opera-ish), and it's overall just bad. Madonna just can't act her way out of her persona; it's too strong. Everyone else is pretty much so-so in this, but I'd leave it up in the air as to whether to blame the director, the rewrite he did, or the acting. It's pretty cartoony and ham-fisted stuff, though. But back to the remake: They don't have to be faithful to the letter, but the original (same name, but with a long subtitle) had so much punch and passion. The rich wife that gets swept away with the socialist sailor and their bickering is hot, intense, fun to watch. It's a great movie in itself, and it has depth with the class issues and smoldering sexuality beneath that bubbles up as these two are stranded. Plus it's tantalizing to watch the power struggle between the leads (in the original, again) as power shifts back and forth. This new version is just awful.

731312,A1EI65WJC85U68,B00007L4OE,"BD Ashley ""vidiot_y2k""","[6, 10]","Based on the 1974 film, SWEPT AWAY is scripted by director Guy Ritchie. How could he? Based on SNATCH and LOCK, STOCK... I was under the impression that the man had TALENT. There's no evidence of that anywhere in this movie.Madonna plays Amber Leighton, a snotty, spoilt social climber who ends up having to take a look at herself when she is shipwrecked on a deserted island (they always are) with a lowly crewmate Peppe (Andriano Giannini). They bicker and fight and gradually, guess what happens next... but they don't have to worry about starving because there's no shortage of turkeys on this island.SWEPT AWAY makes BLUE LAGOON (the Brooke Shields version)and even its sequel, look GOOD.Of all Madonna's movies the only two she was good in were DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN and EVITA. Here she tries to be taken seriously by bravely showing off her wrinkles to the world. She also demonstrates her astounding acting range by bitching and moaning while smoking a cigarillo and riding an exercycle simultaneously. Dustin Hoffman eat your heart out.Is SWEPT AWAY meant to be comedy? Drama? A soap opera? In any case, Madonna and Ritchie should be paying US to watch it (Though even Ritchie has admitted this is an awful movie). This is one of those movies where you feel like you've been watching for half an hour but when you check the clock counter on your DVD/VHS only ten minutes have passed. However, if you've always wanted to see Madonna on her knees grovelling and being slapped across the face this might be money well spent.Extras (which are mildly more interesting that the film) include commentaries by Ritchie and the producer, a behind the scenes feature with Madonna and Ritchie interviewing each other, subtitles and deleted scenes. Save your money, unless you're a die hard Madonna fan.

731313,A2TYSPEDVIGF7W,B00007L4OE,"Bettyboy72 ""Thom""","[10, 14]","I have to agree with other reviews of this film and join the chorus of ""It's not the worst movie I have ever seen."" It's also not a bad performance by Madonna. I think unfortunately this movie was swirled with controversy (remaking a CLASSIC foreign film with politicial and feminist messges, lawsuits from another star who said HE wanted to remake the film with Madonna first, and Guy Ritchie directing his wife, and of course, Madonna's acting ability) before it was even made. When it came out, people were just downright MEAN. I would have loved to have seen it on the big screen, but it never opened here due to the bad press.When you think about all the clunkers that many popular actors or actresses make, why does everyone act like it's the end of the world when Madonna makes less that a 5 star film. Isn't she entitled to some fun as an actress? Does it all have to be EVITA? I, for one, loved her performance in WHO'S THAT GIRL? I think it's a funny film and a good time.I think SWEPT AWAY is a hoot. It's not brain surgery, but it's not meant to be. I agree that Madonna is over the top in the beginning, but during the subtle scenes later in the film, she is very convincing and dare I say, powerful. I think the film is a must own for a Madonna fan and the MTV special with Madonna and Guy is TOO CUTE.Anyway, take time away from your finger pointing at the Material Girl and give Swept Away a watch.

731315,A3PP64HMEYIGF0,B00007L4OE,CastleD,"[4, 7]","Luckily, 'Swept Away' ventured so deep into the realm of BAD at times, it came out on the other side GOOD. If I saw this movie in a theater I would have been annoyed, but it was easy to get into at 1:00 am in the morning on a quiet, boring night at home, just to see how fascinatingly bad it can get. However, it wasn't nearly as bad as people have said, I somehow ended up enjoying the movie on different levels, one being watching Madonna.It's a shame because there were moments in this movie that showed it could have been so much more, particularly a few scenes that took place in Italy. There was a pleasant, ethnic italian atmosphere in those scenes (with italian dialogue) which is rare these days.I won't describe the plot, but eventually Madonna and Adriano Giannini become stranded on a deserted island. The core concept of this movie, the sudden, shifting balance of power in their relationship, is handled in a much more dramatic, even controversial, manner than I expected. Madonna is mercilessly abused, physically even, by Giannini's character, Pepe. I was shocked as I watched, but since Madonna severely abused and humiliated Pepe when she held the cards before they got to the island, the movie is essentially asking the viewer: ""does she deserve this?"" It's a daring question to ask these days.I would like to see the supposedly superior original version, because in some scenes 'Swept Away' effectively gets deep into the nature of power in relationships between men and women, and how they react when it suddenly and dramatically shifts. Unfortunately, the awkward performance from Madonna and some bad dialogue from the other actors hamper this version.It's strange how Madonna is this multi-talented 20th century icon, yet she still can't figure out how to act particularly well. It's simply not in her, period. Her performance here is one of her better ones of late, but in some scenes I was abruptly reminded I was watching Madonna trying to act. I think it's the tone in which she speaks her lines, sort of flat. She doesn't convey emotions and subtlety well. But, I would like Madonna to continue trying, because I like her, and would like to finally see a good performance from her. Another thing, she should start eating greasy, unhealthy foods and stop working out because her body looks fined tuned to the point of being repulsive. Get a little fat on that subcutaneous layer!The bottom line, somehow I ended up liking 'Swept Away' and would actually recommend it, but with a few disclaimers. Watch it late, on a quiet night when you have nothing better to do. Expect some ""so bad it's good"", and be patient because it gets more interesting and surprising as it progresses.

There, they meet Guiseppe (Peppe for short) (played by Adrianno Gianinni), a poor Italian fisherman. Peppe goes through constant torture and frustration with Amber. She annoys his with her selfishness and cruelness. One morning, the two get on a raft to catch up with everybody else, but they get lost. They find an island, which happens to be deserted, as usual. When they get to this island, Peppe turns the tables and tells Amber that he is now in charge. He wants her to know and feel what it's like to be treated like crap, to know and feel what it's like to fend for someone else. As Amber begins to change, the two begin to fall in love.Don't get me wrong. The movie wasn't all that bad. I just wish it could have ended better.

Despite the bad reviews when it was released, it is actually a pretty good movie (!) - I wish critics would have given it the chance that it deserved.I will admit, Madonna isn't the greatest actress ever, but she does make an effort.  (Why doesn't Guy help her more - that's what I can't figure out). Her showmanship really shows through in the dream sequence in the yellow dress - that was great! Once again Guy displays his unique film-making style.  And... Madonna LOOKS great in the movie - what yoga can do for you!  It's also a great story and it has a message.The extras are nice, too - some deleted scenes and a &quot;Making of.&quot;  I enjoyed the &quot;Making of&quot; - got to see Madonna interview Guy - it's so cute how he calls her Mrs. Ritchie and you also get to see the whole family playing around - Madonna, Guy, Lourdes and little Rocco.

731319,A398FD7XNE6ISZ,B00007L4OE,Dave Beards,"[7, 11]","Despite achieving an extraordinary critically acclaimed career as a pop music artist, a successful acting career has so far eluded Madonna. Applauded for her debut role in Desperately Seeking Susan, subsequent acting roles have been publicly criticised except for a handful of hits (A League of their Own, Evita and Dick Tracy come to mind).In 2002 Madonna once again performed in a movie, entitled 'Swept Away.' What makes this movie interesting though is that the writer and director is none other than her husband, acclaimed cult film director Guy Ritchie. I'm sure the knives were already out before the first scene was even shot. The critics don't seem to take too kindly to husband/wife filmmaking teams, and the Madonna/Guy combination was no exception.Before the film hit the cinemas, huge headlines adorned the press proclaiming this movie to be the biggest bomb ever made, so the audiences stayed away in droves. Is this movie really as bad as those critics have suggested?Even though I'm a Madonna fan I tried to see this film without any preconceived ideas, though I was hoping it would be good - and that hope came true.The story centres around Amber (played by Madonna) going on a holiday with her rich husband and several socialite friends. Amber is a money obsessed, emotionally surpressed rich woman that we all love to hate. She makes Pepe's (the ship's resident fisherman and all round helper) life miserable.A turn of events sees Amber and Pepe alone together on a deserted island. It is here where Pepe becomes the 'boss' and Amber must come to grips with being in a situation where money cannot be used to buy whatever she wants.The first thing one notices about Swept Away is the stunning cinematography of the locations. You can almost reach out and touch that crystal clear water. The DOP and Cinematographer should have been nominated for some award for their talents here.So for the burning question - how does Madonna perform???? She has shown that she has matured and developed as an actress to give a credible performance as Amber - playing the mean spirited socialite perfectly with a mixture of comedy and pure meanness. When we see Amber show her emotional and sensitive sides, Madonna comes up trumps here also - I had tears in my eyes watching Amber cope with those last remaining moments of the movie.The DVD itself has some great extras. A 'behind the scenes' featurette actually lives up to it's name - no cheesy self promotional clips here but a true behind the scenes encounter where we see many candid moments between Madonna and Guy, including them with their children. Next is a selection of deleted scenes and the audio commentary with Guy and one of his producers. Whilst divulging the odd interesting fact, it is actually quite tedious to listen to with a considerable amount of umms and aahhhs. He may a brilliant filmmaker but he needs some lessons on how to give good commentary!!!!I found Swept Away to be a wonderfully tender and romantic movie that reached inside me and tugged at my emotions. It is a shame that audiences have been brainwashed into thinking that this is a bad movie just because Madonna is in it. It is actually a well-crafted piece of cinematic art.",5,Don't listen to the critics.....,1054944000,"06 7, 2003",2003,3220,"['achieving', 'extraordinary', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'career', 'pop', 'music', 'artist', 'successful', 'acting', 'career', 'so', 'far', 'eluded', 'Madonna', 'Applauded', 'debut', 'role', 'Desperately', 'Seeking', 'Susan', 'subsequent', 'acting', 'roles', 'have', 'been', 'publicly', 'criticised', 'handful', 'hits', 'A', 'League', 'Own', 'Evita', 'Dick', 'Tracy', 'come', 'mind', '.In', '2002', 'Madonna', 'once', 'again', 'performed', 'movie', 'entitled', ""'Swept"", 'Away', 'What', 'movie', 'interesting', 'though', 'writer', 'director', 'none', 'other', 'husband', 'acclaimed', 'cult', 'film', 'director', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'knives', 'were', 'already', 'out', 'first', 'scene', 'was', 'even', 'shot', 'critics', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'take', 'too', 'kindly', 'husband/wife', 'filmmaking', 'teams', 'Madonna/Guy', 'combination', 'was', 'film', 'hit', 'cinemas', 'huge', 'headlines', 'adorned', 'press', 'proclaiming', 'movie', 'be', 'biggest', 'bomb', 'ever', 'made', 'audiences', 'stayed', 'away', 'droves', 'movie', 'really', 'as', 'bad', 'critics', 'have', 'suggested', 'Even', ""'m"", 'Madonna', 'fan', 'tried', 'see', 'film', 'preconceived', 'ideas', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'hope', 'came', 'true.The', 'story', 'centres', 'Amber', 'played', 'Madonna', 'going', 'holiday', 'rich', 'husband', 'several', 'socialite', 'friends', 'Amber', 'money', 'obsessed', 'emotionally', 'surpressed', 'rich', 'woman', 'love', 'hate', 'Pepe', 'ship', 'resident', 'fisherman', 'round', 'helper', 'life', 'miserable.A', 'turn', 'events', 'sees', 'Amber', 'Pepe', 'alone', 'together', 'deserted', 'island', 'here', 'where', 'Pepe', ""'boss"", 'Amber', 'must', 'come', 'grips', 'being', 'situation', 'where', 'money', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'used', 'buy', 'wants.The', 'first', 'thing', 'one', 'Swept', 'Away', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'locations', 'can', 'almost', 'reach', 'out', 'touch', 'crystal', 'clear', 'water', 'DOP', 'Cinematographer', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'award', 'talents', 'here.So', 'burning', 'question', 'how', 'Madonna', 'perform', 'shown', 'matured', 'developed', 'actress', 'give', 'credible', 'performance', 'Amber', 'playing', 'mean', 'spirited', 'socialite', 'perfectly', 'mixture', 'comedy', 'pure', 'meanness', 'When', 'see', 'Amber', 'show', 'emotional', 'sensitive', 'sides', 'Madonna', 'up', 'trumps', 'here', 'also', 'had', 'tears', 'eyes', 'watching', 'Amber', 'cope', 'last', 'remaining', 'moments', 'movie.The', 'DVD', 'great', 'extras', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'actually', 'up', 'name', 'cheesy', 'promotional', 'clips', 'here', 'true', 'scenes', 'encounter', 'where', 'see', 'many', 'candid', 'moments', 'Madonna', 'Guy', 'including', 'children', 'Next', 'selection', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Guy', 'one', 'producers', 'Whilst', 'divulging', 'odd', 'interesting', 'fact', 'actually', 'quite', 'tedious', 'listen', 'considerable', 'amount', 'umms', 'aahhhs', 'may', 'brilliant', 'filmmaker', 'lessons', 'how', 'give', 'good', 'commentary', 'found', 'Swept', 'Away', 'be', 'wonderfully', 'tender', 'romantic', 'movie', 'reached', 'tugged', 'emotions', 'shame', 'audiences', 'have', 'been', 'brainwashed', 'thinking', 'bad', 'movie', 'just', 'Madonna', 'actually', 'well-crafted', 'piece', 'cinematic', 'art']",Swept Away
731320,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B00007L4OE,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[3, 5]","I would like you to read this summary of ""Swept Away"" and ask yourself if this is disturbing or not.  It's about a selfish, stubborn wife (Madonna) of a rich businessman going sailing across Italy; she often insulted and barked orders at her rugged sailor (Adriano Giannini).  Both her and the sailor took a raft to follow her friends at a expedition, but then the raft's engine stalled and they were stuck on sea until the currents drifted them on an uncharted small island.  From there, the sailor showed the nasty socialite who's boss and forced her to do all his chores, call him master, and be manipulated through physical and mental abuse into his own personal love slave.Personally, I was terrified.  It sounds too much like a psychological character drama byLars Von Trier, and yet this film treats this kind of story in a compassionate, loving light; heck, the film even dared to use an Arvo P&auml;rtmusicto express a hint of romance, which was AFTER Madonna's character almost got raped.  I do not know what went on in Guy Ritchie's mind when he had his then-wife involved in such a film.  It's purportedly a remake of a '70s Italian film, and I'd probably give that movie a break given the times and how Italians treat women there, but I can't give the same leniency for ""Swept Away"".  The characters are so horrible and hateful, though to be fair, Madonna's character is suppose to be like that so she can have a personality change later on, but that turned out to be worse.  I felt sorry for the sailor at first, but once he had the upper hand, he went too far and threw away shred of likability about him.  His character could've been better had he just teach her the ways of survival and have her learn to see him eye-to-eye as an equally respectable human being, regardless of class. Instead, he stooped to her level and I hated how he forced her to do his bidding and making her fall in love with him.  This is not a romantic couple, this is a controlling, heartless, painful and scary affair built around male dominance from the primitive ages.""Swept Away"" has no charm or elegance within this beautiful scenery, this is sadism.  In fact, by the time it reached the third act, I felt the complete opposite of how I was suppose to feel.  I was hoping for the couple to break up, I wanted for the 'bad guy' to win, because the wife has been too mindbroken to settle for such an abusive sailor.  It's movies like this that I had to remind people that there are more incompatible movie couples thanEdward & Bella.  This might be a film for anti-Madonna fans who like to see her get her just desserts, but she doesn't even deserve this kind of treatment and this is from someone who doesn't like her that much.To me, this is one of the worst romance films out there, but maybe I just didn't get it.  Considering the average Amazon rating for this movie, there are people who praise this film, and I'm completely baffled.  I was also completely baffled about ""Doctor Zhivago"", an epic film about a man who dumped his family so he can be with a mistress, and yet most people thought it's a masterpiece.  Maybe this film's sadistic nature IS suppose to be charming, and I'm just too sane and level-headed to accept it.",1,False Temptation,1279929600,"07 24, 2010",2010,3229,"['would', 'like', 'read', 'summary', 'Swept', 'Away', 'ask', 'disturbing', 'not', 'selfish', 'stubborn', 'wife', 'Madonna', 'rich', 'businessman', 'going', 'sailing', 'Italy', 'often', 'insulted', 'barked', 'orders', 'rugged', 'sailor', 'Adriano', 'Giannini', 'sailor', 'took', 'raft', 'follow', 'friends', 'expedition', 'then', 'raft', 'engine', 'stalled', 'were', 'stuck', 'sea', 'currents', 'drifted', 'uncharted', 'small', 'island', 'there', 'sailor', 'showed', 'nasty', 'socialite', 'who', 'boss', 'forced', 'do', 'chores', 'call', 'master', 'be', 'manipulated', 'physical', 'mental', 'abuse', 'own', 'personal', 'love', 'slave.Personally', 'was', 'terrified', 'too', 'much', 'psychological', 'character', 'drama', 'Von', 'Trier', 'yet', 'film', 'kind', 'story', 'compassionate', 'loving', 'light', 'heck', 'film', 'even', 'dared', 'use', 'Arvo', 'P', 'auml', 'express', 'hint', 'romance', 'was', 'AFTER', 'Madonna', 'character', 'almost', 'got', 'raped', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'went', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'mind', 'when', 'had', 'then-wife', 'involved', 'such', 'film', 'purportedly', 'remake', ""'70s"", 'Italian', 'film', ""'d"", 'probably', 'give', 'movie', 'break', 'given', 'times', 'how', 'Italians', 'treat', 'women', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'same', 'leniency', 'Swept', 'Away', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'horrible', 'hateful', 'be', 'fair', 'Madonna', 'character', 'suppose', 'be', 'can', 'have', 'personality', 'change', 'later', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'worse', 'felt', 'sorry', 'sailor', 'first', 'once', 'had', 'upper', 'hand', 'went', 'too', 'far', 'threw', 'away', 'shred', 'likability', 'character', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'had', 'just', 'teach', 'ways', 'survival', 'have', 'learn', 'see', 'eye-to-eye', 'equally', 'respectable', 'human', 'being', 'regardless', 'class', 'Instead', 'stooped', 'level', 'hated', 'how', 'forced', 'do', 'bidding', 'making', 'fall', 'love', 'not', 'romantic', 'couple', 'controlling', 'heartless', 'painful', 'scary', 'affair', 'built', 'male', 'dominance', 'primitive', 'ages', 'Swept', 'Away', 'charm', 'elegance', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'sadism', 'fact', 'time', 'reached', 'third', 'act', 'felt', 'complete', 'opposite', 'how', 'was', 'suppose', 'feel', 'was', 'hoping', 'couple', 'break', 'up', 'wanted', ""'bad"", 'guy', 'win', 'wife', 'been', 'too', 'mindbroken', 'settle', 'such', 'abusive', 'sailor', 'movies', 'had', 'remind', 'people', 'are', 'more', 'incompatible', 'movie', 'couples', 'thanEdward', 'Bella', 'might', 'be', 'film', 'anti-Madonna', 'fans', 'who', 'like', 'see', 'get', 'just', 'desserts', ""n't"", 'even', 'deserve', 'kind', 'treatment', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'much.To', 'one', 'worst', 'romance', 'films', 'there', 'maybe', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Considering', 'average', 'Amazon', 'rating', 'movie', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'praise', 'film', ""'m"", 'completely', 'baffled', 'was', 'also', 'completely', 'baffled', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'epic', 'film', 'man', 'who', 'dumped', 'family', 'can', 'be', 'mistress', 'yet', 'most', 'people', 'thought', 'masterpiece', 'Maybe', 'film', 'sadistic', 'nature', 'IS', 'suppose', 'be', 'charming', ""'m"", 'just', 'too', 'sane', 'level-headed', 'accept']",Swept Away

731322,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B00007L4OE,Douglas King,"[11, 16]","Madonna has tried so hard over the years to establish herself as a film actress, that every time she makes a movie I secretly hope that she'll finally succeed. Unfortunately &quot;Swept Away&quot;, although not the horrific mess it was portrayed to be in the press, is a mediocre film. &quot;Swept Away&quot; is the story of a rich socialite who ends up stranded on a deserted island with a tempermental fisherman who she eventually falls in love with. The film is neither as funny or romantic as it was hoping to be. This isn't entirely Madonna's fault, but her performance isn't particularly great. I don't think Madonna is a terrible actress, but I think she should stick to supporting roles (like she did in &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;, &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot;, etc.) She just doesn't have what it takes to carry a film. The qualities that makes her a great pop star actually get in the way of her acting; every move she makes seems too smooth and choreographed and the result is that she appears wooden onscreen. Adriano Giannini is convincing and sexy as her love interest, and the two do have some chemistry. And the gorgeous Mediterranean scenery does make the film easy on the eyes.

731323,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B00007L4OE,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[3, 7]","Richard Roper called Swept Away ""the worst film of 2002."" That was before I saw the movie so then I couldn't judge it. Eberts worst movie I'm fighting with but that is not for this reveiw.(Death to Smoochy was a geat movie.) I didn't think I would even get to see Swept Away. The movie didn't even make a million dollars in cash at the box office so when a small local video store got it I was shocked but glad. I have been wanting to get to see that film for sometime after reading the horrible reveiw for it on Ebert and Roeper at the Movies. I watched it and decided in two simple words ""not bad."" I didn't think it was horrible but most critics probally compared it to the orignal Swept Away. I'll have to see that and get to that later on in life. Swept Away was funny at times but I felt that the premise has been used to death. Getting stranded on a deserted island was funny with Gilligans Island but enough is enough. How about something different for a change. Like getting stranded at sea. There is something that I feel hasn't been done to death and it is interesting. Another ""Swept"" flaw is that it just took a really long time to get into it. They got stranded on the island after the first half hour was over and then got off it forty five minutes later. It's not a long film either. At a cool 88 minutes according to my DVD player ""Swept Away"" is a bumpy ride but thank goodness for me that bumpy ride doesn't last for the entire film.Madonna is the star. Why? She is not that great an actress from what I have seen. Actually to me her best work to date is probally The Next Best Thing. She was alright in this but I considering Madonna as a better singer then she is an actress. No offenise Madonna. In the film she plays Amber. A rich, snotty, women who with her husband Anthony chartered a boat with a few of there friends. There friends include Debi,Mike Marina,and Todd. All couples they are traveling from Greece to Italy. The boat's crew cannot be more nicer to the couples but of course these rich people see the crew as there ""lesser class."" But Amber is always angry at fisherman Giusseppe played by Adriano Giannini the son of the director of the orignal Swept Away. Giusseppe is likewise always ticked off at amber and is tired to her calling him names like ""PePe."" The captain tells him to grin a bear it and that the vaction will be over soon. But when Amber makes him ferry her to a cave where they are going to meet her friends. He doesn't want to go to long distance but does and in the middle of the ocean the motor stops working and the boat capsizes. They land on an island and when Giusseppe looks around he finds out that there is nobody on the island. Since she can't hunt she finds out that she needs him to survive but he forces her to become his ""slave"" when he finds out. He makes her endure the same kind of treatment that she made him have. Of course if you spend enough time when someone you eventually fall in love with them which is exactly what happens between the two main characters in Swept Away. They must decide what they are going to do in the future and how they both feel about the opposite one. From the moment there feet touched that island their lives were both Swept Away.I enjoyed Swept Away, I really did.

This is a story of class and sexual struggle between a man and woman stranded on a desert island. Madonna plays Amber Leighton, the arrogant wife of a rich American pharmaceutical mogul (Bruce Greenwood) who travels on a private yacht from Greece to Italy with friends. Her constant bitching annoys a first-mate Giuseppe Esposito... (Andriano Giannini)I cannot believe that the same Guy who is behind stylish, energetic, funny, and full of wonderful tunes and interesting characters ""Snatch"" made it. Acting made me and my husband cringe dozens of times. I have not seen the original movie and would like to compare the two but the scenes between two main characters on the island in the Ritchie's movie were simply gross and tasteless. Giannini seemed to not having inherited any of his father's talent or charisma. The ending seemed so overtly sentimental and out of place. There were only three redeeming values. First, the beginning was kind of funny with Madonna playing the arrogant uber-bitch very convincingly. Second, deserted island and beach somewhere in Mediterranean sparkle.

Why would Madonna fall in love with a man who was abusive towards her and ordered her to call him &quot;master&quot;? Seriously, I found Madonna's love interest in Swept Away absolutely repulsive... He even tries to rape her in one scene.  Are we really supposed to believe he is a sensitive guy? Madonna plays a bitchy rich woman at first, which is so much fun to watch!  I disagree with another reviewer who said Madonna wasn't as charming as Goldie or Meg Ryan could have been at this part...I think she was very funny. I basically liked the movie until they were stranded on an island and the man started beating her up. I think that was awful. I know they were trying to make a point, but it didn't work.Honestly, though, I found Madonna charming and beautiful in this film. When she has that moment of catharsis on the island and realizes she can't be bitchy to the man who provides her food, you can see the humility growing in her. She becomes much more vulnerable. At the end, when Madonna cries, it is really touching. There's really no excuse for calling Madonna a bad actress. Yes, she could make better choices regarding film projects, but she probably wanted to do this for her husband.

She gives him no real room to stretch out and show any kind of real emotion, and he ends up looking as wooden as the luxury boat they argue on.I'm disappointed once again by her performance, which shows about as much growth as any 4th grader in their first leading role could.I want to go on, and normally I do, but I'm going to leave you with this one thought:The video? Crystal clear, and the island they are deserted on is wonderfully treated - swaying hot tropical jungles, almost white sandy beaches, perfect for two people to connect, both eotionally and sexually if they were deserted and knew that maybe one day they would be rescued.The audio? Perfect as well.The movie, the acting, the lack of real substance and horrible non-ending that is nowhere near the original ending and so forced my arm hurt from being twisted so badly? I almost threw up in my mouth a little.Internationally, Madonna can do no wrong. I expect that in the UK she is as revered as another of our USA saints, Michael Jackson. Here in America? Not so much. Her star has dropped way off the charts a long time ago.I give this disaster (which, after an abysmal showing in the U.S. theaters, the ""unrated"" U.K. version of the film was released directly to DVD worldwide) 2 stars at best.Yuk.I feel so dirty having reviewed this I'm immediately watching the original, which has a wonderful dry sexual spirit to it.Madonna should NOT quit her day job.",2,"A vile, angry, boring, pale imitation of a classic film...",1326672000,"01 16, 2012",2012,2105,"['say', 'like', 'Madonna', 'film', 'second', 'flat', 'attempt', 'copy', 'already', 'well-established', 'story', 'first', 'being', 'Evita', 'also', 'say', 'would', 'rather', 'prefer', 'eat', 'McDonalds', 'artifical', 'food', 'sit', 'fine', 'restaurant', 'eat', 'well-prepared', '5-course', 'dinner.I', 'would', 'love', 'give', 'point', 'point', 'description', 'how', 'sad', 'boring', 'drawn-out', 'NON-feminist', 'movie', 'as', 'opposed', 'Lina', 'Wertmuller', 'fantastic', 'expositive', 'view', 'male', 'female', 'roles', 'society', 'love.Madonna', 'truly', 'bitch', 'disaster', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'given', 'somewhat', 'haphazard', 'attempt', 'act', 'co-star', 'Giancarlo', 'Giannini', 'lookalike', 'son', 'Adriano', 'real', 'room', 'stretch', 'out', 'show', 'kind', 'real', 'emotion', 'up', 'looking', 'as', 'wooden', 'luxury', 'boat', 'argue', 'on.I', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'once', 'again', 'performance', 'as', 'much', 'growth', '4th', 'grader', 'first', 'leading', 'role', 'could.I', 'want', 'go', 'normally', 'do', ""'m"", 'going', 'leave', 'one', 'thought', 'video', 'Crystal', 'clear', 'island', 'are', 'deserted', 'wonderfully', 'treated', 'swaying', 'hot', 'tropical', 'jungles', 'almost', 'white', 'sandy', 'beaches', 'perfect', 'two', 'people', 'connect', 'eotionally', 'sexually', 'were', 'deserted', 'knew', 'maybe', 'one', 'day', 'would', 'be', 'rescued.The', 'audio', 'Perfect', 'well.The', 'movie', 'acting', 'lack', 'real', 'substance', 'horrible', 'non-ending', 'nowhere', 'original', 'ending', 'so', 'forced', 'arm', 'hurt', 'being', 'twisted', 'so', 'badly', 'almost', 'threw', 'up', 'mouth', 'little.Internationally', 'Madonna', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'expect', 'UK', 'as', 'revered', 'USA', 'saints', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Here', 'America', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'star', 'dropped', 'way', 'charts', 'long', 'time', 'ago.I', 'give', 'disaster', 'abysmal', 'showing', 'U.S.', 'theaters', 'unrated', 'U.K.', 'version', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'directly', 'DVD', 'worldwide', '2', 'stars', 'best.Yuk.I', 'feel', 'so', 'dirty', 'having', 'reviewed', ""'m"", 'immediately', 'watching', 'original', 'wonderful', 'dry', 'sexual', 'spirit', 'it.Madonna', 'should', 'NOT', 'quit', 'day', 'job']",Swept Away

No law required me to pay money to watch this Madonna DVD -- but there are laws requiring that I help pay for things I don't use (public schools) or want (crop subsidies).  There's no law preventing other entertainers from competing with Madonna, either as singers or actors -- but there are laws strictly limiting competition with the U.S. Postal Service.

He must know if she is true, would she be with him back in society? Where is her heart really?...He must know, he jumps to his feet, runs for the waters, swimming to the yacht... and they are rescued.The ending pales, yes, as reality falls like a terrible wet blanket on the following scenes. Difficult to get through. Almost as bad as the beginning when you have to watch how terrible she is, how she treats the crew especially Esposito... whom she actually knows somewhere deep inside her there. Past her material, zero degree heartbeat; she is drawn to his realness, his old world heart and vision of life...Now, rescued... back in the little Italian seaside village. The characters take their places like some strange ugly energy playing itself out through them, except for Esposito.

I don't know what Guy Ritchie was thinking. He was the reason I saw this because I love Snatch. This movie is nothing to the level of Snatch.Amber Leighton(Madonna) is a very wealthy woman. She is very cold and hates almost everybody. She has a flaw for everything and is very upset with the vactation that her husband Todd planned.Giuseppe ""Peppe"" Esposito(Giannini) is an italian sailor working on the yacht that Amber is touring the Mediteranean on. He is given the assignment to take care of her every need and is always at her beckon call. The two hate each other and it's obvious. Peppe can't do anything though because he's the servant and it's his job to put up with all her crap.While on the boat one day Amber misses the diving trip with all the other passengers. She demands that Peppe take her even though he says it's not safe to venture out. The two do and suprise suprise the raft motor breaks and strands the two.The two find an island after some time at sea and Peppe has had enough of Amber. He quickly puts his foot down and tells her that he is the master know and she is his servant in all aspects. If she wants to survive she will do his will no matter what it is. She is disobiedient to him at first but after he slaps her around and beats her she comes around to liking him some.The tension only continues to grow between the two and after Peppe rapes her on the beach Amber starts to fall for him. She knows he's the only way she can survive so she submits to his will and falls in love with him. Peppe doesn't know if the love is ture though and wants to get off the island. Amber however wants to stay because the two can't be together if they are ever found.The movie is just horrible. From all aspects is it bad. The acting isn't good and Madonna needs to just give it up. She is a singer and should stick to that. I hate her character, but could never separate the two from each other.Adriano Giannini isn't all that bad in the movie and is given the most to work with. However, there is no man patient enough in the world to put up with what his character goes through and that kills the movie. Amber is taken way to far early on. It is great though getting to watch Madonna get slapped by Giannini mutiple times.The rape scene was the final straw for me. It was stupid and not believable the way they shot it. The whole idea of her falling in love with him after he does it is a far stretch as well. By the time this happened I really was looking forward to the end of this.The love scenes are another bad thing in the movie. They aren't believable at all. You can tell Ritchie isn't comfortable shooting his nude wife with another man. He should have cast a different actress or not tried to shoot the scenes.The movie is bad. The critics were right on this time. This movie should have been ""Swept Away"" to a dump because thats where it belongs.

It was getting slammed before anyone even saw it or a screening. I have to agree with Entertainment Weekly's review and give it a B or 4 stars out of 5.Madonna is completely convincing as the rich, arrogant Amber who always gets her way and goes out of her way to torture her servant and costar Adriano Giannini. After the two are stranded on a deserted island, the fun begins and the power falls to her servant who can hunt and supply food. It is rather fun to what Madonna get slapped around.The cinematography is also well done and the Mediterranean setting plays perfect. Over all, this movie really is funny and fun to watch.

731346,A1HCHMYMPO97CL,B00007L4OE,M. J. Dirou,"[2, 4]","I have to admit this film was somewhat of a guilty pleasure for me. I actually enjoyed it, and found it to be nowhere near as bad as the critics ruthlessly dismissed it to be. I think by now the critics just automatically follow suit in trashing any Madonna movie vehicle and have made up their minds before they even see it. Having said this, I will also agree that Madonna will never be an Academy award winning actress. She's an amazing music and performance artist, but she comes off much better on stage and in music videos, than as a film actress. I don't know what it is, I don't think it's just the fact that we can't forget she's 'Madonna'; I think it's also her voice, it's a bit tinny and flat. Although she seems much less self-conscious and wooden in this film and her performance more believable, when you put her next to her co-star, Adrianno Giannini, she comes off as an amateur in comparison. Still they did have chemistry, and I found the love affair that grew between their characters quite tender and moving. And yes the ending is sad, but appropriate I think.This 70's film remake probably suffered also because it's just out of place today and too politically incorrect. It's really more of an arty European style film, and frankly I think Madonna is just too commercial to pull it off. Without meaning to sound patronizing, I feel that many rather 'conditioned' more westernized audiences, may not get the point of it, and would find it too daringly offensive to women. There are however, many subtexts to this film and it does have some interesting and rawly honest things to say about power in a falsely, capitalistic society versing power in nature, and also the balance of power in male/female relationships (as well as the male ego).The scenery and locations are beautiful and the music also fitting, but Guy Ritchie's script, which he admitted to improvising and writing as he filmed, is quite weak and not terribly inspired. The supporting cast don't have much to work with here but do a sound job. Jean Tripplehorne, plays her part well, and I actually found Madonna quite amusing in parts. She does like to swear a lot though doesn't she, both in real life and on screen. In the 'extra feature' off camera segments, every second word that comes out of her mouth is ""f***ing"". Does she think it impresses people? Not me I must say. It makes her come off as coarse and a bit childish. The 'Amber' character is is quite fitting for her in a way, however if I were a male, I don't know that I'd find her very muscular and adrogynous physique particularly attractive. I think she needs to soften her look a bit for film roles like this. She looks more like an athlete in training than a pampered millionairess.Also, it seems apparent that Guy Ritchie was none too comfortable in shooting scenes with his Mrs in the clutches of another man, though he didn't seem to mind her being slapped and kicked around. The sex scenes (or lack of) aren't very realistic or erotic, and Madonna I notice, modestly covers her breasts in every coital scene (this from the woman who bared all in her sex book!). The fact that they were living so naturally in the primitive Island setting could have waranted raunchier and earthier sex scenes. May have also helped to sell more tickets too!Overall though, this is one of Madonna's better outings and she's not at all bad in this film. Some might say Guy Ritchie will never live this one down, but I'm sure he anticipated the risks of making such a film with his mega-famous wife. No doubt he calculated a financial return at least in the home video market, from all those not game to see it in the cinema. Even if you're not a Madonna fan see this film if you're curious, and don't always be swayed and controlled by 'the critics'. Talk about balance of power, they have too much of it over audiences I think.",3,Guilty Pleasure,1135728000,"12 28, 2005",2005,3868,"['have', 'admit', 'film', 'was', 'somewhat', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'found', 'be', 'nowhere', 'as', 'bad', 'critics', 'ruthlessly', 'dismissed', 'be', 'think', 'now', 'critics', 'just', 'automatically', 'follow', 'suit', 'trashing', 'Madonna', 'movie', 'vehicle', 'have', 'made', 'up', 'minds', 'even', 'see', 'Having', 'said', 'will', 'also', 'agree', 'Madonna', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'Academy', 'award', 'winning', 'actress', 'amazing', 'music', 'performance', 'artist', 'off', 'much', 'better', 'stage', 'music', 'videos', 'film', 'actress', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'just', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'think', 'also', 'voice', 'bit', 'tinny', 'flat', 'much', 'less', 'self-conscious', 'wooden', 'film', 'performance', 'more', 'believable', 'when', 'put', 'next', 'co-star', 'Adrianno', 'Giannini', 'off', 'amateur', 'comparison', 'Still', 'did', 'have', 'chemistry', 'found', 'love', 'affair', 'grew', 'characters', 'quite', 'tender', 'moving', 'yes', 'ending', 'sad', 'appropriate', 'think.This', '70', 'film', 'remake', 'probably', 'suffered', 'also', 'just', 'place', 'today', 'too', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'really', 'more', 'arty', 'European', 'style', 'film', 'frankly', 'think', 'Madonna', 'just', 'too', 'commercial', 'pull', 'off', 'meaning', 'sound', 'patronizing', 'feel', 'many', 'rather', ""'conditioned"", 'more', 'westernized', 'audiences', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'point', 'would', 'find', 'too', 'daringly', 'offensive', 'women', 'are', 'however', 'many', 'subtexts', 'film', 'have', 'interesting', 'rawly', 'honest', 'things', 'say', 'power', 'falsely', 'capitalistic', 'society', 'versing', 'power', 'nature', 'also', 'balance', 'power', 'male/female', 'relationships', 'as', 'well', 'male', 'ego', 'scenery', 'locations', 'are', 'beautiful', 'music', 'also', 'fitting', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'script', 'admitted', 'improvising', 'writing', 'filmed', 'quite', 'weak', 'not', 'terribly', 'inspired', 'supporting', 'cast', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'work', 'here', 'do', 'sound', 'job', 'Jean', 'Tripplehorne', 'part', 'well', 'actually', 'found', 'Madonna', 'quite', 'amusing', 'parts', 'swear', 'lot', ""n't"", 'real', 'life', 'screen', ""'extra"", 'feature', 'off', 'camera', 'segments', 'second', 'word', 'mouth', 'f***ing', 'think', 'people', 'Not', 'must', 'say', 'come', 'off', 'coarse', 'bit', 'childish', ""'Amber"", 'character', 'quite', 'fitting', 'way', 'however', 'were', 'male', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'d"", 'find', 'very', 'muscular', 'adrogynous', 'physique', 'particularly', 'attractive', 'think', 'soften', 'look', 'bit', 'film', 'roles', 'more', 'athlete', 'training', 'pampered', 'millionairess.Also', 'apparent', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'was', 'none', 'too', 'comfortable', 'shooting', 'scenes', 'Mrs', 'clutches', 'man', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'mind', 'being', 'slapped', 'kicked', 'sex', 'scenes', 'lack', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'realistic', 'erotic', 'Madonna', 'notice', 'modestly', 'breasts', 'coital', 'scene', 'woman', 'who', 'bared', 'sex', 'book', 'fact', 'were', 'living', 'so', 'naturally', 'primitive', 'Island', 'setting', 'could', 'have', 'waranted', 'raunchier', 'earthier', 'sex', 'scenes', 'May', 'have', 'also', 'helped', 'sell', 'more', 'tickets', 'too', 'Overall', 'one', 'Madonna', 'better', 'outings', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'might', 'say', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'will', 'never', 'live', 'one', 'down', ""'m"", 'sure', 'anticipated', 'risks', 'making', 'such', 'film', 'mega-famous', 'wife', 'doubt', 'calculated', 'financial', 'return', 'least', 'home', 'video', 'market', 'not', 'game', 'see', 'cinema', 'Even', ""'re"", 'not', 'Madonna', 'fan', 'see', 'film', ""'re"", 'curious', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'be', 'swayed', 'controlled', 'critics', 'Talk', 'balance', 'power', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'audiences', 'think']",Swept Away

I enjoy films about being stranded on a deserted island, so I thought this might be worth a look.  As I watched it, I couldn't believe how incredibly bad it is, but I couldn't place my finger on what exactly was so bad about it.  I'm not sure if Guy Ritchie should be blamed for it or Madonna, but something with this movie is off.  With bad acting and a bad plot, this film is probably one of the worst I've ever seen.  On the DVD, the only saving grace is seeing a feature where Guy Ritchie and Madonna interview each other.  I wish that was offered on a separate DVD, because I'd buy that...and I don't want this film in my collection.  Its a film that should have stayed in the private collection of Ritchie/Madonna's home movies.  At the very least, I hope this film kills any chance that Madonna will be given another starring role in any future film project.

I heard some woman fantasize about rape, but believe me its very different from the real thing. That's why it's called a fantasy.

731352,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,B00007L4OE,Richard Ross,"[3, 5]","A better question would be why didn't Madonna and Guy Ritchie ever make another movie  together since this one worked  so well for the both of them? The film is pretty dreadful and has very little to recommend. However there are a  few scenes that are  funny and genuinely  romantic. The highlight of the  film besides  Madonna in a tight two piece black bikini is a great performance from Elizabeth Banks. Banks plays the ultimate dumb blonde who is the younger girlfriend of one of the men on board. She is mocked mercilessly but is too stupid to catch on. What is  interesting is the possible  commentary that Guy Ritchie was making about his marriage.  The divorce details that were all over the gossip pages months ago show up here on  screen. Madonna (in  the movie at least) is extremely shrill, commanding, demanding, and  obsessed with working out. What is more interesting is why Ritchie, coming off of the success of Snatch, would  make this film which has haunted his career ever since. Why would he cast his wife in the lead and make her a very unsympathetic and grating character? The film boils down to this: a bunch of rich snobs rent a boat to sail from island to island on a Mediterranean vacation. The ship is run by mostly Italian sailors. The richies above make fun of the staff's broken English and comment on  how dirty they are. Madonna's character is the worst of them all as she singles out one man in particular . His name is PePe but she calls him Pee Pee just to annoy  him. He takes as much of this as he can.  There is  a hilarious scene where he  dreams of getting his revenge by pouring the food that she finds disgusting all over her and then throwing her off the ship. He then attacks the husband who sits idly by and doesn't say a word. One day while half the party goes to explore some islands Madonna and PePe go off in a separate boat to meet up with them. As it gets later in the day and they get farther away from the ship the engine goes out on them and leaves them stranded . She freaks out but he is amused. He is confident that by  morning they will be rescued.They end up landing on a deserted island where they wait for months  for a ship to spot them and rescue them. While on the island PePe turns the tables and makes Madonna his slave. He roughs her up when he starts slapping and kicking her.He demands that she start calling him Master. He makes her responsible for supplying her own food and shelter. She  also must do his laundry and prepare his meals.  In the middle of this extreme role reversal the two fall for each other.  It is interesting to watch as Richie shows  his wife being  dominated and put in her place by a man. Was he wishing he could do the same in real life? While on the island she opens up to PePe and offers an explanation for why she is unhappy. She explains that she's  bored with her life. She tells him that this is the first time she has been happy in a long time is  being here with him. PePe wonders if she will feel the same way when they are inevitably rescued and brought back to civilization.

It was roasted by critics, shunned by moviegoers, and having finally seen it, not only can I understand why, but I can also sympathize with those who actually bothered to see it in theatres.  In this hopelessly inept remake of the 1974 film of the same name, Madonna is Amber, the agitated wife of a millionaire who boards on a cruise with two other couples.  Never satisfied with anything, she barks orders at the hapless worker Guiseppe (Adriano Giannini), and misses no opportunity to belittle him.  For reasons I won't bother to explain, Amber and Guiseppe end up on a deserted island, where Guiseppe becomes enraged by Amber's nasty behavior and slaps her around and forces her into submission for much of their stay.  This role reversal is supposed to warm up Amber's ice-cold demeanor, and she eventually ends up in a love triangle where she's torn between Guiseppe and her husband.  And so on.  But what you really wanna know is: ""Is Swept Away"" as bad as they say it is?  Well, it's bad.  Not merely because of Madonna's performance, which proves once again that she can't act.  It's not merely because of director (and Maddy's husband) Guy Ritchie.  And it's not bad merely because it's painfully boring.  ""Swept Away"" reeks chiefly because of its sexist plot, which basically says that an unreasonable woman can be ""tamed"" if you smack her around a few times and force her to call you ""master"" as Amber did at Guiseppe's command.

But after watching the film, I couldn't understand why critics hated it so much.To be fair, Madonna, like any artist, is subject to criticism.  The book, ""Sex"" and films like ""Shanghai Surprise,"" and ""The Next Best Thing"" were just ill-advised projects that did nothing for her or her talent.But ""Swept Away"" is the perfect choice for a Madonna film.  Casting Madonna as a middle-aged housewife only shows that Madonna, whose fame and personality has always benefitted from her vanity, is embracing middle-age and is finding parts suited to her age.  I like how Madonna is shot in ""Swept Away"".  There are harsh close-ups, she is not made to look like a goddess, and her hair at the beginning is quite charming.In fact, I found Madonna's performance to be quite poignant.  I liked how she played the brittle side of her character, and gradually let her guard down throughout the movie.  So many people have complained about how unlikeable the characters were, but I liked how the movie did not gloss over the less glamorous side of the characters, and allowed them to be seen in less flattering lights.  After all, passionate romances verge from love to hate, and this movie certainly showed that.Madonna seems to be at another low point in a career of mostly highs (this is probably the worst its been since the post-""Sex"" phase).

But if you ask me whether the new version &quot;Swept Away&quot; remade from the 1974 Italian original deserves a bad name, well, I also have to agree.Let's forget the fact it's Madonna's film directed by Madonna's hubby Guy Ritchie.  Even so, this &quot;Swept Away&quot; starts very shakily; we are introduced to the group of not so likable people on a cruising boat.  Madonna is the ice queen Amber, ordering Italian fisherman Giuseppe serving her as lackey to do whatever she thinks of so cruelly, and she treats him as if he is an animal ... no, worse, she abuses.  Fans, is that what you want to see?  And she is so alarmingly convincing, too.  If only she is Meg or Goldie, we might be enchanted.  But of course, she is not.Then Amber and Giuseppe are swept away (after several of very silly events) by the tide on a small broken boat, and they reach a small deserted island where no one lives.  You know it's the table-turning time, and Giuseppe, far apt to adjust to the new stuation, takes the initiative.  Now see what he does.  He slaps Amber several times, plus gives some kicks to her body, and even orders her to him &quot;Master.&quot;And sfter these incredibly rough proceedings, a true love is born between them.  Sorry, but I don't believe that.  Especially when you see an improvised musical section in which Madonna starts to lip-sync to the song &quot;Come on-a My House.&quot;  And it was inserted as if to extend the running time, which should have been much shorter.Even if it's not Madonna, the film would be a fiasco.  The film's tone is not constant, with jumbled mixture of anything you think of on the hot deserted island.  The love is sincerely described, or at last they try to do so.  But when we are surprised to find that tender tone superceding the film's story, things are almost over.Maybe I should not say so, but Madonna is born in 1958.  Of course, she is still beautiful, but in this film, Guy Ritchie mysteriously refuses to show her that way.  Actually, Amber's character is so nasty at first, and her usual charms all vaporized under the scorching sun, so you cannot find the Madonna as we know her.Whether Madonna can really act or not is a tough question to answer, and I don't know still the truth about it, but Madonna of &quot;Swept Away&quot; is not definitely the Madonna her fans want to see.  And the actor Adriano Giannini is just a typical Italian hunk, nothing more.  While watching this film, I wished that Tom Hanks and some backetball turned up suddenly, and take over the film entirely.

I hope Madonna and Guy Ritchie make a movie again in the future. She CAN act, and he CAN direct.

It is visually stunning with great scenes of Greece and the Mediterranean islands.Madonna stars in this movie as a rich aristocrat with no soul; she is bossy, obnoxious and bitchy. Her character is entirely unlikable and her performance is bland. She perks up after she gets stranded on an island with the super hunk Adriano Giannini, who wouldn't! Once Madonna's role is pared down to survival her acting gets better too. Giannini is excellent as an Italian fisherman trying to earn a few extra bucks working on a Greek yacht. The story becomes a bit predictable until the ending which is actually quite sad.This film's redeeming quality is found in the gorgeous backdrops as well as Giannini's character. It is a blatant slap in the face of the rich and powerful and shows them as a lower class hidden beneath all their wealth. Maybe that is why this film fared poorly at the box office!

731367,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00007L4OE,Wuchak,"[4, 7]","It's fun and entertaining, but also thought-provoking and moving.""Swept Away"" is a 2002 remake of the 1974 Italian film starring Madonna and directed/written by Madonna's (then) husband Guy Ritchie.THE PLOT: A group of rich Americans take a private cruise from Greece to Italy where a spoiled middle-aged woman, Amber (Madonna), mentally abuses the crew, in particularly the first mate Pepe (Adriano Giannini) whom she constantly refers to as PeePee. The crew puts up with her pompous antics because she's the paying customer, but everything changes when Amber and Pepe are stranded on a deserted Island, putting Pepe in a position of control.For the record, I'm not a follower of Madonna; I neither love her nor hate her. In fact, I almost didn't watch this film because she starred in it, but I gave-in because I'm a sucker for survival-on-deserted-island flicks. I'd also like to point out that I've never seen the original '74 film, so I have no nostalgic bias.""Swept Away"" failed at the box office in 2002, but only because it was barely released to theaters and critics condemned it before it was even completed. It subsequently swept (away) the Razzies as the worst picture and a bandwagon effect developed with everyone jumping into the negative feeding frenzy.Is it really THAT bad? No. Not even close. ""Swept Away"" starts as a fun, entertaining farce and morphs into a potent social commentary and, finally, a moving love story. The movie will make you laugh, make you angry, make you cry and ultimately move you -- no kidding. But it will only have this effect IF you refuse to listen to the drivel of the cookie-cutter critics and give it a chance.As for Madonna, she's no Meryl Streep but she successfully makes you despise Amber in Act 1 and feel for her later on. She made me believe Amber was a real person. What more do you want?I'm not an anti-capitalist but the film effectively points out the flaws of this system. It also effectively reveals how money/materialism can't of itself give true happiness, love or fulfillment. Amber had everything but was the most unhappy, loathsome person you'd likely ever meet.One reviewer referred to the film as a ""wife beater's fantasy"" but failed to point out that it could just as easily be called a ""Man torturer's fantasy"" or ""Man emasculater's fantasy."" Let's be evenhanded with our appraisals.I admit the physical abuse of Amber on the island (slapping, kicking and especially the faux-rape) is disturbing and almost tempted me to tune out, but then I saw what the filmmakers were shooting for, the filmmakers being Madonna and her husband.In our society we've been misled to believe that mental abuse is less abusive because it's not physical. This film effectively shows that mental abuse can be just as bad, if not worse.***SPOILER ALERT***During the first half hour Amber horribly torments and emasculates Pepe (and others) because she's a spoiled brat and in control. When the tables are turned and she loses control on the island Pepe utilizes extreme measures to de-spoil Amber. In other words, Pepe realized that Amber was so far gone -- so utterly spoiled -- that she literally needed slapped back to reality. This is in line with a biblical proverb ""Blows and wounds cleanse away evil and beatings purge the inmost being."" Let's face it, some people are so far gone (that is, spoiled) that they literally need the snot beat out of them -- that's the only thing that's going to wake 'em up to reality. Apparently Pepe realized this on the island and acted accordingly. Do I think he goes too far? Yes, but -- then again -- I wasn't the one mentally tormented for days on the boat and totally emasculated in front of others. Regardless, the story shows that his methods worked -- Amber was humiliated to the point of seeing life from a totally different perspective, a much-needed new perspective. Pepe's discipline ultimately brings out spiritual character in Amber to the point where she refuses to call on passing boats to save her from her exile (two moving scenes, by the way). Why? Because she's been delivered from the bondage of selfishness, arrogance and materialism; she has experienced true love, fulfillment, team-work, companionship and independence (remember, she DOES learn how to fish for herself) for the first time in her life. It becomes more precious than gold to her and she doesn't want to let it go.Again, I think Pepe goes too far with the physical abuse (in fact, I don't believe in physical ABUSE at all); he should've stopped with a couple of slaps, at most, but the filmmmakers are (evidently) saying she was so far gone that extreme measures were necessary. Besides, didn't she make her own bed, so to speak? Let her lie in it.***END SPOILER***The fact that Madonna -- one of the most successful women in history and the original ""material girl"" -- utilized this film to make this point speaks volumes. Is it a sign of weakness? No, it's a sign of enlightenment and spiritual strength.BOTTOM LINE: ""Swept Away"" is much better than similar flicks like 1998's ""Six Days, Seven Nights"" with Harrison Ford and Anne Heche. Why? Because, not only is it fun and entertaining, it's also thought-provoking and moving. Really, what more do you want from a stranded-on-a-deserted-island romantic-comedy? Needless to say, those who go overboard with the negative criticism need to get real.The film runs a short-but-sweet 89 minutes and was filmed in Sardinia and Malta.The DVD features a 20-minute making-of piece with Madonna and Guy Ritchie interviewing each other. It's an entertaining, informative and revealing piece. The DVD also features 16 deleted scenes.GRADE: A- or B+",5,"Wow, a romantic-comedy that's actually really good",1235520000,"02 25, 2009",2009,5666,"['fun', 'entertaining', 'also', 'thought-provoking',
