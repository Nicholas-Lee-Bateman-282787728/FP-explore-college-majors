When problems at school delay him from joining his girlfriend and her folks on their vacation getaway, he's determined to find any way to catch up with them, even take up with a questionable post-modern pirate of a ship's captain played by Loggia (who delivers the classic line that headlines this review).  The movie attempts to be all it can be, with subplots involving a family of crooks, a kidnapping, and a search for paternal acceptance, but it's mostly held afloat by Cusack and Loggia's repartee.  This is one of Cusack's last pure-breed 80's comedys before he broke out into his dramedy films of the 90's, and his loud &quot;I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING TO ME!&quot; schtick wears a little thin by the conclusion, but all parties involved were smart enough to keep the film short, so it's not painfully obvious.
