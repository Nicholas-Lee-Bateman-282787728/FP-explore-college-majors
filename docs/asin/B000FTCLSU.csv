995754,A149OQJD0ASI07,B000FTCLSU,,"[0, 0]","Seasons 1, 2 and 4 lend themselves to solitary viewing one can do without having seen prior seasons and not getting the feeling you missed crucial plot elements.Seasons 3 and 5 of ""The Wire"" conclude cliffhanger endings that will only add up if you watched prior seasons.David Simon planned a five-part, five-season series here but by 2004, he wasn't completely sure if they'd be renewed yet (of course, they were), so he wrote this season powerful and complete enough to be a series end if necessary.What viewers get is a masterfully written adventure that documents the downfall of Season 1's West Baltimore drug empire and the rise of a new one, a careful examination of the community's War on Drugs while also detailing just how screwed up and ineffective some of the city's basic institutions (City Hall, The Police) are, bogged down by politics, bureaucracy and conflicting interests.Season 4 (Baltimore School System) is my personal favorite but Season Three is probably the most powerful of all five seasons because you see the great storylines at all levels -- the Streets, City Hall, the Police -- and get to see how clearly what effects/influences one directly effects and influences the others.Chalked full of social commentary, bitter endings for some of the series' most popular characters and poetic justice for others.A bonus to purchasing this Season's DVDs are the Special Features Q&A; with the shows' writers, producers and cast members Idris Elba (Stringer Bell), Jamie Hector (Marlo Stanfield) and Seth Gilliam (Sgt. Carver).""The Wire"" is so beloved for its presentation of complex moral issues, multi-dimensional character representations and realistic portrayals of the hypocritical world we live in.

995756,A33L7G4E8CID3,B000FTCLSU,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[67, 73]","After a virtuosic first season and an ambitious (but not quite as thrilling) second season, The Wire's third season proved to be the best one yet. Even though it hasn't been embraced by the public at large (like, say, The Sopranos), the show has received gobs of critical acclaim and delivers the goods, too, every week. I think that not only is The Wire a better show than The Sopranos (which is, admittedly, a truism), but it is a show which better reflects our post-9/11 mindset than its erstwhile New Jersey neighbor. The Sopranos is a product of another time, the zeitgeist of the late 1990s, with its constant putdowns of moneyed, whining, shrink-visiting, latte-sipping, politically-correct hipsters (the Eagles song ""Get Over It"" being perhaps the definitive cultural manifesto of the time). That show produced three excellent seasons of TV, but then 9/11 changed the world and Tony, Paulie, et al, never managed to get back ahead of the curve. The Wire was formed in direct response to 9/11 and links the drug war to the War on Terror, in both a direct and indirect sense, while examining the institutions (both legitimate and seamy) and the individuals that inhabit them. Although the show is described (even by itself) with such terms as ""gritty"" and ""unvarnished"", it is actually not so simple--in the show, as in life, few people fall into the sinner and saint categories. Leaders in these institutions are generally rational and even the antagonists occasionally speak uncomfortable truths. The result is a universe in which we find people's character defined not by their social or economic position.Season 3 builds on the previous seasons and returns to the streets for a showdown between Avon Barksdale's (Wood Harris) crew (still managed, in the interim, by Stringer Bell (Idris Elba)) and a vicious upstart by the name of Marlo, who has taken control of Avon's territory thanks to Stringer's attempts to go straight. On the law side, Kima's (Sonja Sohn) doubts about motherhood continue to grow, while newly-minted Deputy Commissioner Rawls (John Doman) rips district commanders to shreds (and is the subject of a revelation of some interest). At the center of it all is Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West), whose liaison with an elite political consultant leads to some quite surprising conclusions that make you reevaluate the character entirely. The political plotline leads naturally into the new arena the show explores, Baltimore's city politics, which prominently features two figures: Mayor Clarence Royce, who seems like an honest, reasonable man, and City Councilman Tommy Carcetti (Adrien Gillen), whose character flirts the line between raw ambition and occasional idealism. In between these personalities is still-Acting Commissioner Burrell (Frankie Faison), whose previous cock-of-the-walk status gives way to getting chewed out by the Mayor. There are plenty more great storylines: Daniels (Lance Reddick) hooking up with Pearlman (and dealing with his nominal wife), Bunk trying to find a wounded officer's gun, and Major ""Bunny"" Colvin deciding to legalize drugs in condemned areas in order to keep the dealers off the streets. Colvin's plan does reduce crime, and things seem to be getting better, except that the legal drug area (""Hamsterdam"") is a hellhole, and eventually the plan is exposed. This plotline just goes to show how much bigger problems can get if they're ignored. Overall, a spectacular season from a show that exceeds even high expectations.",5,Way down in the hole?

It is perhaps the best portrayal of office politics on television. The fact that the two businesses in competition are police and drug dealers is ironic, but it does not detract from the recognisability of the situations the characters face - pressures for sales and results from often venial managers more concerned with their own comfort and careers than the consequences of their decisions. In this the Wire insists on treating all the characters, cops, drug dealers, murderers and politicians as human beings, rather than as two-dimensional heroes and villians.Further the complexity and challenges of policing are detailed in compelling fashion and it never pretends there are easy answers to the problems posed by drugs and poverty in depressed inner cities.If this gives the impression of staid worthiness then forgive me: the show is also exciting, sexy and often very funny.

995758,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B000FTCLSU,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[2, 3]","The third season of ""The Wire"" takes aim at City Hall and the way politics subverts efforts to fight crime and put the bad guys away.Most of the familiar characters are back, both good and bad guys (if you can tell the difference) and a few new ones are added.The plot revolves around the decision by Police Major Colvin, who controls western Baltimore, to try a new experiment to cut the crime waves destroying his community. He designates three small areas as drug zones where police will not interfere in sales and trafficking as long as the hoodlums leave the rest of the neighborhood alone. As a result, crime drops and the neighborhood shows signs of renewal. Of course, when the police commissioner, the mayor and the media find out, all hell breaks lose.Though still vastly superior nearly anything else on TV, I found this series a little less riveting than the previous two. Perhaps it's because of the growing feeling anyone watching these dramas must get that in the end it's all fruitless. Drug dealers and gang leaders come and go but the drug trade remains. One gang is broken up and its leaders sent to prison: another instantly rises to fill the gap. The market is always there and as long as there's big money to be made and no alternatives, someone will fill it. As my own research showed inGates of Injustice: The Crisis in America's Prisons (Prentice Hall Paperback)the ""war on drugs"" has been a disaster for our inner-cities and our society as a whole.In this series, we see that there's no honor among thieves. But there's no honor among politicians either. The one difference is that the thieves ultimately settle their differences with bullets.Well, I'm going to plow on and see the next two seasons. Perhaps the greatest strength of ""The Wire"" is its all-encompassing view. We see one aspect of the problem after another. Heroic individuals struggle to redeem the city and themselves but the task is too great without a change of heart by society as a whole and massive government intervention.",4,Still riveting but a little off the standard,1236556800,"03 9, 2009",2009,2020,"['third', 'season', 'Wire', 'aim', 'City', 'Hall', 'way', 'politics', 'subverts', 'efforts', 'fight', 'crime', 'put', 'bad', 'guys', 'away.Most', 'familiar', 'characters', 'are', 'back', 'good', 'bad', 'guys', 'can', 'tell', 'difference', 'few', 'new', 'ones', 'are', 'added.The', 'plot', 'revolves', 'decision', 'Police', 'Major', 'Colvin', 'who', 'western', 'Baltimore', 'try', 'new', 'experiment', 'cut', 'crime', 'destroying', 'community', 'three', 'small', 'areas', 'drug', 'zones', 'where', 'police', 'will', 'not', 'interfere', 'sales', 'trafficking', 'as', 'long', 'hoodlums', 'leave', 'rest', 'neighborhood', 'alone', 'result', 'crime', 'drops', 'neighborhood', 'signs', 'renewal', 'course', 'when', 'police', 'commissioner', 'mayor', 'media', 'find', 'out', 'hell', 'breaks', 'still', 'vastly', 'superior', 'nearly', 'anything', 'else', 'TV', 'found', 'series', 'little', 'less', 'riveting', 'previous', 'two', 'Perhaps', 'growing', 'feeling', 'anyone', 'watching', 'dramas', 'must', 'get', 'end', 'fruitless', 'Drug', 'dealers', 'gang', 'leaders', 'come', 'go', 'drug', 'trade', 'One', 'gang', 'broken', 'up', 'leaders', 'sent', 'prison', 'instantly', 'fill', 'gap', 'market', 'always', 'there', 'as', 'long', 'big', 'money', 'be', 'made', 'alternatives', 'someone', 'will', 'fill', 'own', 'research', 'showed', 'inGates', 'Injustice', 'Crisis', 'America', 'Prisons', 'Prentice', 'Hall', 'Paperback', 'war', 'drugs', 'been', 'disaster', 'inner-cities', 'society', 'whole.In', 'series', 'see', 'honor', 'thieves', 'honor', 'politicians', 'either', 'one', 'difference', 'thieves', 'ultimately', 'settle', 'differences', 'bullets.Well', ""'m"", 'going', 'plow', 'see', 'next', 'two', 'seasons', 'Perhaps', 'greatest', 'strength', 'Wire', 'all-encompassing', 'view', 'see', 'one', 'aspect', 'problem', 'Heroic', 'individuals', 'struggle', 'redeem', 'city', 'task', 'too', 'great', 'change', 'heart', 'society', 'whole', 'massive', 'government', 'intervention']",The Wire: Season 3

995764,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B000FTCLSU,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[2, 2]","With its third year, The Wire heads back to the streets and unfinished business. As with the second year, the third season opens up another dimension of the city, this time City Hall and the civil and police administration, but the focus is squarely back on the Barksdale organisation and Lt. Daniels' unit trying to bring them down and finish the job begun back in Season 1.Season 3 opens with Avon Barksdale still inside, but his parole hearing is coming up. His friend and collaborator Stringer Bell has guided the crew through some lean times and formed a 'co-op' with several other gangs which has led to them making some serious money but at the cost of sharing each other's turf. However, a new player, Marlo Stanfield, is on the way up and is not interested in sharing his territory with anyone else. The stage is set for a series of bloody showdowns and bodies dropping on the streets, to the growing discontent of the police. Lt. Daniels and his unit are forced to drop their investigation into Bell (begun at the end of the second season) to concentrate on the war, unaware that the two are connected. This war is complicated by the re-emergence of Omar Little, who has sworn to bring down Bell for manipulating him into shooting an innocent man in the second season.At the same time, an ambitious white city councilman, Tommy Carcetti, is planning to run for mayor, although his prospects in a city with a majority black population seem poor. Connecting these two storylines is a highly controversial initiative launched by police Major Colvin to move the drug dealers off the street corners into three abandoned city blocks where the police will turn a blind eye to their activities so they can concentrate more on murders and crime prevention elsewhere. The 'Hamsterdam' storyline, apparently inspired by the 'legalise drugs' movement, is a stunning and surprisingly even-handed piece of social commentary. There is also an ongoing subplot following the attempts of former Barksdale enforcer Dennis 'Cutty' Wise to go straight after spending fourteen years in prison.Season 3 is tighter than the second season, as it is able to link the storylines together more effectively than the second, where the trials of the Barksdale gang were largely removed and separate from events on the docks. The new characters, both on the streets and in the city hall, are also more directly tied to the storylines that have gone before and are stronger as a result.Thematically, the idea behind Season 3 appears to be that of failed reform. The failure of the city's drug prevention strategies encourage some radical, out-of-the-box thinking from Major Colvin. Whilst his policy is initially successful, it leads to a whole host of knock-on effects which are beyond his powers to address, and give a rather depressing impression that, indeed, no one man can make a difference to the system. The breathtaking cynicism and corruption of the political wing of the city is depicted, with Carcetti determined to reform the system from the inside, again with apparently little hope of success. Stringer Bell's attempts to reform himself and his friend Avon on his release from prison into respectable businessmen provides the season with its main narrative spine, but again does not have a happy ending. That said, there are moments of hope, with Cutty's attempts to go straight finally garnering some success and McNulty's attempts to straighten out his personal life ending on a positive note.The ending of the season seems to be a little more definitive than the prior two, but the writers take care to leave enough loose ends untied to be pursued into the fourth year, with the candidates for mayor squaring up, several of the gang leaders still very much at large and the police unit once again finding themselves heading off in separate directions.The Wire: Season 3 (*****) follows up on the first two by being just as dramatically intense with some superb characterisation, brilliant acting and some finely-judged moments of comedy to balance the darkness elsewhere.",5,The best show on TV continues,1224460800,"10 20, 2008",2008,4066,"['third', 'year', 'Wire', 'heads', 'back', 'streets', 'unfinished', 'business', 'second', 'year', 'third', 'season', 'up', 'dimension', 'city', 'time', 'City', 'Hall', 'civil', 'police', 'administration', 'focus', 'squarely', 'back', 'Barksdale', 'organisation', 'Lt.', 'Daniels', 'unit', 'trying', 'bring', 'down', 'finish', 'job', 'begun', 'back', 'Season', '1.Season', '3', 'opens', 'Avon', 'Barksdale', 'still', 'inside', 'parole', 'hearing', 'coming', 'up', 'friend', 'collaborator', 'Stringer', 'Bell', 'guided', 'crew', 'lean', 'times', 'formed', ""'co-op"", 'several', 'other', 'gangs', 'led', 'making', 'serious', 'money', 'cost', 'sharing', 'other', 'turf', 'However', 'new', 'player', 'Marlo', 'Stanfield', 'way', 'not', 'interested', 'sharing', 'territory', 'anyone', 'else', 'stage', 'set', 'series', 'bloody', 'showdowns', 'bodies', 'dropping', 'streets', 'growing', 'discontent', 'police', 'Lt.', 'Daniels', 'unit', 'are', 'forced', 'drop', 'investigation', 'Bell', 'begun', 'end', 'second', 'season', 'concentrate', 'war', 'unaware', 'two', 'are', 'connected', 'war', 'complicated', 're-emergence', 'Omar', 'Little', 'who', 'sworn', 'bring', 'down', 'Bell', 'manipulating', 'shooting', 'innocent', 'man', 'second', 'season.At', 'same', 'time', 'ambitious', 'white', 'city', 'councilman', 'Tommy', 'Carcetti', 'planning', 'run', 'mayor', 'prospects', 'city', 'majority', 'black', 'population', 'seem', 'poor', 'Connecting', 'two', 'storylines', 'highly', 'controversial', 'initiative', 'launched', 'police', 'Major', 'Colvin', 'move', 'drug', 'dealers', 'street', 'corners', 'three', 'abandoned', 'city', 'blocks', 'where', 'police', 'will', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye', 'activities', 'can', 'concentrate', 'more', 'murders', 'crime', 'prevention', 'elsewhere', ""'Hamsterdam"", 'storyline', 'apparently', 'inspired', ""'legalise"", 'drugs', 'movement', 'stunning', 'surprisingly', 'even-handed', 'piece', 'social', 'commentary', 'also', 'ongoing', 'subplot', 'following', 'attempts', 'former', 'Barksdale', 'enforcer', 'Dennis', ""'Cutty"", 'Wise', 'go', 'straight', 'spending', 'fourteen', 'years', 'prison.Season', '3', 'tighter', 'second', 'season', 'able', 'link', 'storylines', 'together', 'more', 'effectively', 'second', 'where', 'trials', 'Barksdale', 'gang', 'were', 'largely', 'removed', 'separate', 'events', 'docks', 'new', 'characters', 'streets', 'city', 'hall', 'are', 'also', 'more', 'directly', 'tied', 'storylines', 'have', 'gone', 'before', 'are', 'stronger', 'result.Thematically', 'idea', 'Season', '3', 'be', 'failed', 'reform', 'failure', 'city', 'drug', 'prevention', 'strategies', 'encourage', 'radical', 'out-of-the-box', 'thinking', 'Major', 'Colvin', 'Whilst', 'policy', 'initially', 'successful', 'whole', 'host', 'knock-on', 'effects', 'are', 'powers', 'address', 'give', 'rather', 'depressing', 'impression', 'indeed', 'one', 'man', 'can', 'make', 'difference', 'system', 'breathtaking', 'cynicism', 'corruption', 'political', 'wing', 'city', 'depicted', 'Carcetti', 'determined', 'reform', 'system', 'inside', 'again', 'apparently', 'little', 'hope', 'success', 'Stringer', 'Bell', 'attempts', 'reform', 'friend', 'Avon', 'release', 'prison', 'respectable', 'businessmen', 'season', 'main', 'narrative', 'spine', 'again', 'not', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'said', 'are', 'moments', 'hope', 'Cutty', 'attempts', 'go', 'straight', 'finally', 'garnering', 'success', 'McNulty', 'attempts', 'straighten', 'out', 'personal', 'life', 'ending', 'positive', 'note.The', 'ending', 'season', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'definitive', 'prior', 'two', 'writers', 'take', 'care', 'leave', 'enough', 'loose', 'ends', 'untied', 'be', 'pursued', 'fourth', 'year', 'candidates', 'mayor', 'squaring', 'up', 'several', 'gang', 'leaders', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'large', 'police', 'unit', 'once', 'again', 'finding', 'heading', 'off', 'separate', 'directions.The', 'Wire', 'Season', '3', '*****', 'up', 'first', 'two', 'being', 'just', 'dramatically', 'intense', 'superb', 'characterisation', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'finely-judged', 'moments', 'comedy', 'balance', 'darkness', 'elsewhere']",The Wire: Season 3

At best it would end up being a secret santa present or a rotating loan between friends and family. The Wire is different and actually worth the investment. The third season shifts the focus back to the Baltimore drug dealers and picks up where Season 1 left off. While the plot and characters specifically related to Season 1 aren't as gripping as the original season, this third season starts to highlight the political scene in Baltimore and incorporates many characters introduced in the second season. As with the first season, the beauty of the show lies in the careful character development and the attention to detail. There are no extra characters who appear in one episode never to be seen again - even the seemingly least important background character will come up again later in the season and again in subsequent seasons. More importantly there are no filler episodes in the season - each one is important to the plot of the season, the overall plot of the series and to the development of major and minor characters.I wouldn't consider myself a tv junkie or a dedicated fan of crime dramas like Law & Order, but this series is simply too good to miss out on.

This season also adds a new element - the politicians. While the cops like McNulty, Freemon, Greggs, et al go after Stringer (Idris!), Avon, et al, new characters are introduced with a NEW GAME to follow: Mayor Royce, Councilman Carcetti, and their game with Police Commissioner Burrell et al. A new youngblood Marlo is also introduced to add some good ole' gangsta warfare.This season has it all. The same social-political themes, the academic and cinematographic nuiances - all string the story lines along. But now, you got the good ole cops and gangsta games, gangsta wars, and political wars.

The third season focuses on the street level struggle between gangsters for control of the drug trade, the desperation of the police to show measureable progress in their fight against narcotics, and the political maneuvering at the highest levels of municipal government.  There is much more going on as well in this complex, intelligently scripted series, far too much to touch upon in a brief review.Just in case my opening paragraph makes the show sound too cerebral, rest assured that it rests on a foundation of engaging characters and gritty storylines.  We have McNulty (Dominic West), the dedicated cop whose personal life is a shambles, Stringer Bell (Idris Elba), the ruthless drug lord trying to become a legitimate businessman, Bubbles (Andre Royo), the good-hearted junkie who feeds information to the police, Tommy Carcetti (Adrien Gillen), the councilman with designs on the mayor's seat who struggles with balancing his idealism with political expediency, Major ""Bunny"" Colvin (Robert Wisdom), whose radical solution to the drug plague will shake the city from top to bottom, and far too many more to list here.If you haven't seen this show before, begin with the first season.

Some of the best story telling and acting I've seen in a long time.  The characters personalities are compelling and captivating.  You just get hooked.I was a Soprano's snob.  I just felt it was the best thing on TV and safely tucked away in Jersey so I didn't have to think about the crimes affecting my life.Before I viewed The Wire, I guess I didn't want to be bothered with the whole urban crime thing, especially so close to home.  I felt like what on earth could these kids, with pants hanging down to there knees and rap music blasting have to say that's intelligent?I found that the crime hierarchy is so much like the Sopranos, organized to the point of being genius.  I found just like the Sopranos there is a Family like element, but a brutality that is unbelievable.There are characters you will love but know they are paid to kill.  Characters you find ultimately ruthless almost with animal cunning.  Then you will find some characters eloquent in there lifestyle and speech.Among the characters in Season one, a young dealer who lives in a condemned building with about 6 little elementary school kids.  He buys food for them and sends them off to school.  He's lost with no parents like those kids.  The show isn't preachy in any way.  It just is.Also The Wire is about both sides of the coin.  The police officers, politics, and lifestyles are just as riveting.  Cops that drink too much, have an awful family life, fighting with ex's, or not giving a damn.The THIRD SEASON of THE WIRE is no exception.

I say this because no other show has such a depth in character. Every character has a certain duality and I mean every charater. I'll admit that I'm the type who likes to cheer for the bad guys and the problen with most TV shows within the crime genere is that they favor the good guys too much and it gets boring. On the Wire the line between good and bad isn't all that clear to begin with because at some point everybody is human. Most shows are black and white with a small grey area but the Wire has chosen to function entirely in the grey area and that's what makes it so good.Of course I have my favorite characters but honestly I love them all. The ones that really stand put to me are ""Stringer Bell, because he's so smooth...even when he's slippin'"" ""Brother Mouzone, the Nation of Islam hitman who might just be the scariest dude on the show"" and McNaulty which surprises me because normally a crusading good guy character like him will eventually wear thin, but you can't help but like the guy.Those charaters are some of my favorites but like I said every character in the show gives you a reason to feel somthing for them.Season three doesn't miss and I suggest you get the first two seasons before you watch this one.

Each season, ""The Wire"" moves from strength to strength, resulting in a powerful ensemble work in which each character is given their due, and every scene has purpose and dramatic heft.  I'm a fan of a lot of classy shows -- ""Buffy,"" ""Six Feet Under,"" ""Deadwood,"" ""Freaks And Geeks,"" ""Lost,"" ""America's Next Top Model"" -- but none of them has had such a consistent track record.  There hasn't been a slack or weak episode of ""The Wire"" yet, and the show just gets better and better.  Comparing it to ""The Sopranos,"" for example, I'm shocked by how far down Tony and his crew have fallen off my radar...

995779,AXO4PQU0XG3TG,B000FTCLSU,Dwight,"[0, 0]","For much of the first three years, Avon seems to take a backseat to his partner and childhood friend Stringer especially when he is in jail.  It's only when he corrects Stringer over his expansionist dreams that you realize that Avon's actually smarter and that scene where Stringer looks at him is very law of the jungle when you acquiesce to the superior force.Avon's smarter.Of course, the glamorous most beloved, most entertaining character is Omar and the loveliest most admirable character is Lester BUT Avon's SMART.  It would have been enjoyable to have gotten more of a taste of him especially against Marlo.Each season has a different flavor and spirit and I think that Season 3 being a fan favorite has to do with lots of power play, action, posturing and none of the undeniable grief of children in jeopardy in Season 4 and the kind of winding down feeling of Season 5.  The deal with Season 2 is it just isn't about the fan favorites.  Season 1 was our shock introduction so it was just disturbing, upsetting, sad but of course, still easier to digest than ""The Corner.""This season is the one with the grandstanding performances - the ""aren't they a treat?"" scenes.

995780,A2O8K7L29RLY54,B000FTCLSU,"E. Kutinsky ""ekutinsky""","[1, 1]","If you've made it to reading about the third season of The Wire, there's no shortage of the amount of praise you've heard, so let me start with something I didn't love about season 3.  Trying to create a theme this season about politics, season 3 spends a great deal of time on a plotline about Councilman Carcetti, played dutifully by Aidan Gillen, and his seething need to be mayor.  I have to admit that as a rod for the season, I didn't care about it that much - his campaign manager, played by Brandy Burre, is also a rather uninteresting character, or perhaps, I'm forced to admit, that Burre is the first actor hired onto The Wire to be beneath her part.I start with the way it doesn't work because while it's going on, you're treated to some of the most astonishing television ever created (there's that praise again), and to say that eventually, Carcetti's plotline joins the fold and gets interesting.  It joins the fold through a different rod of the season - Mjr Colvin, embodied with fierce drive by Robert Wisdom, who decides to conquer the Baltimore drug problem, in a way, by moving it - he drives the dealers we've come to be familiar with and some others into a ""free zone"" where drugs can be legalized, an idea that works to an extent, but one that no one can talk about without destroying the world around them.  It's that ""talk"" that the season is really about - that is to say, the politics, from the top down.  Beyond Carcetti's literal politics and Colvin's political maneuvering within the police department, there's the internal politics of the drug world - of our familiar faces of Barksdale (Wood Harris) and Stringer Bell (Idris Elba) competing in their own way for the heart of what it means to be gangsters - is it blood or business that keeps them all going?  The combination of the drug world and the political world - and that includes our always-central crew of detectives, each of whom go through their own political and personal disaster or two in the course of the year - is what makes The Wire so free of easy answers, and so impossible to shake.There are two scenes that, I think, embody what the show succeeds at so well this season - in the first, late in ""Time After Time,"" the season premiere, Colvin cruises his police car around his filth and crime-ridden West Baltimore streets.  He stops as a young boy tries to sell him crack.  Colvin pulls out his badge, his hat, etc., and with each step, the boy is completely unthwarted in his attempt.  We think, not knowing Colvin, that we're about to see a cop crusing for addictions of his own, but we see the opposite - the heartbreak of the streets on those that want to do good, and the total irrelevance of police in stopping it.  The scene crushes expectations nearly as quickly as it does your heart.And the second?  The second scene that blew my mind is the one that taught me that Idris Elba, sitting under our nose as Stringer Bell for so long, could be one of the great actors of his generation.  During ""Homecoming"" he's having dinner with Donette (Shamyl Brown), D'Angelo Barksdale's lonely widow, when Stringer snaps at her about telling D'Angelo's mother that D's murder may have been a murder.  Stringer is the drive of all the season's best drama, but it's at the point he yells at her, revealing the gangster under the chilly pose, that we realize, fully, just who he is.  Where it goes from there during the remainder of the season is pure business on this show - as cynical as it is daring, as fearless as it is inevitable.  To watch Elba's work this season is to see the capabilities on a television show that holds its audience's intelligence at a premium, and does it by fulfilling its own storytelling capabilities.  What happens this season changes everything we've seen on The Wire up to this point - its finale, ""Mission Accomplished,"" ties up so many loose ends,  its hardly a surprise that we even see a ""Reelect Frank Sabotka"" poster in its final minutes - that you're shocked at just what dramatic power it retains.",5,Mission accomplished,1192233600,"10 13, 2007",2007,4035,"[""'ve"", 'made', 'reading', 'third', 'season', 'Wire', 'shortage', 'amount', 'praise', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'so', 'let', 'start', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'season', '3', 'Trying', 'create', 'theme', 'season', 'politics', 'season', '3', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'plotline', 'Councilman', 'Carcetti', 'played', 'dutifully', 'Aidan', 'Gillen', 'seething', 'need', 'be', 'mayor', 'have', 'admit', 'rod', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'campaign', 'manager', 'played', 'Brandy', 'Burre', 'also', 'rather', 'uninteresting', 'character', 'perhaps', ""'m"", 'forced', 'admit', 'Burre', 'first', 'actor', 'hired', 'Wire', 'be', 'part.I', 'start', 'way', ""n't"", 'work', 'because', 'going', ""'re"", 'treated', 'most', 'astonishing', 'television', 'ever', 'created', 'praise', 'again', 'say', 'eventually', 'Carcetti', 'plotline', 'fold', 'interesting', 'fold', 'different', 'rod', 'season', 'Mjr', 'Colvin', 'embodied', 'fierce', 'drive', 'Robert', 'Wisdom', 'who', 'conquer', 'Baltimore', 'drug', 'problem', 'way', 'moving', 'dealers', ""'ve"", 'come', 'be', 'familiar', 'others', 'free', 'zone', 'where', 'drugs', 'can', 'be', 'legalized', 'idea', 'extent', 'one', 'one', 'can', 'talk', 'destroying', 'world', 'talk', 'season', 'really', 'say', 'politics', 'top', 'down', 'Beyond', 'Carcetti', 'literal', 'politics', 'Colvin', 'political', 'maneuvering', 'police', 'department', 'internal', 'politics', 'drug', 'world', 'familiar', 'Barksdale', 'Wood', 'Harris', 'Stringer', 'Bell', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'competing', 'own', 'way', 'heart', 'what', 'be', 'gangsters', 'blood', 'business', 'going', 'combination', 'drug', 'world', 'political', 'world', 'always-central', 'crew', 'detectives', 'whom', 'go', 'own', 'political', 'personal', 'disaster', 'two', 'course', 'year', 'what', 'Wire', 'free', 'easy', 'answers', 'so', 'impossible', 'are', 'two', 'scenes', 'think', 'embody', 'what', 'show', 'so', 'well', 'season', 'first', 'late', 'Time', 'Time', 'season', 'premiere', 'Colvin', 'police', 'car', 'filth', 'crime-ridden', 'West', 'Baltimore', 'streets', 'young', 'boy', 'sell', 'crack', 'Colvin', 'out', 'badge', 'hat', 'etc.', 'step', 'boy', 'completely', 'unthwarted', 'attempt', 'think', 'not', 'knowing', 'Colvin', ""'re"", 'see', 'cop', 'crusing', 'addictions', 'own', 'see', 'opposite', 'heartbreak', 'streets', 'want', 'do', 'good', 'total', 'irrelevance', 'police', 'stopping', 'scene', 'crushes', 'expectations', 'nearly', 'as', 'quickly', 'heart.And', 'second', 'second', 'scene', 'blew', 'mind', 'one', 'taught', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'sitting', 'nose', 'Stringer', 'Bell', 'so', 'long', 'could', 'be', 'one', 'great', 'actors', 'generation', 'Homecoming', 'having', 'dinner', 'Donette', 'Shamyl', 'Brown', ""D'Angelo"", 'Barksdale', 'lonely', 'widow', 'when', 'Stringer', 'telling', ""D'Angelo"", 'mother', 'D', 'murder', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'murder', 'Stringer', 'drive', 'season', 'best', 'drama', 'point', 'revealing', 'gangster', 'chilly', 'pose', 'realize', 'fully', 'just', 'who', 'Where', 'remainder', 'season', 'pure', 'business', 'show', 'as', 'cynical', 'daring', 'as', 'fearless', 'inevitable', 'watch', 'Elba', 'work', 'season', 'see', 'capabilities', 'television', 'show', 'audience', 'intelligence', 'premium', 'fulfilling', 'own', 'storytelling', 'capabilities', 'What', 'season', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Wire', 'up', 'point', 'finale', 'Mission', 'Accomplished', 'up', 'so', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'hardly', 'surprise', 'even', 'see', 'Reelect', 'Frank', 'Sabotka', 'poster', 'final', 'minutes', ""'re"", 'shocked', 'just', 'what', 'dramatic', 'power']",The Wire: Season 3

This tells you two things about ""The Wire"":1. **You need to pay attention.** That's a scarce commodity these days - which is why the show will never be as big a ratings hit as it deserves. And I'm sure I'll lose this product more sales than I gain when I boast how a critical plot development in Season 3 will make little sense if you didn't watch Season 1. [Or at least carefully read the episode summaries on HBO's web site.] But that's the kind of show it is - where you learn a very surprising (and telling) fact about one of the two dozen or so major supporting characters by a wordless two-second shot at the end of a scene that was about a different sub-plot entirely. Also: the thick street accents and liberal use of gangsta and police slang will probably have you hitting the Rewind button on your DVD remote more than once.2. **You will enjoy paying attention.** [I'll bet that no one would be willing to watch 12 episodes of, say, ""Without A Trace"" in three days.] Although its fellow HBO show ""Deadwood"" is the one noted for the savory richness of its dialogue, one could argue that ""The Wire"" is equally eloquent - though unprintable - while being a little less precious about it.

995787,A2BWQ2C3QW32YP,B000FTCLSU,"GZA ""gza""","[3, 3]","HBO's The Wire is the best television I've ever seen. Creator David Simon and writer Ed Burns have crafted something that's utterly unique among contemporary TV dramas - a complex, gripping and believable portrait of a city (Baltimore) and its struggle to rise above the poverty, corruption and violence that seeks to bleed the life out of it.More akin to a novel in its thorough exploration of character and motive, social and historical context, each season of The Wire unfolds in a series of chapters which must be taken as a whole. Seen through the eyes of both the Baltimore PD surveillance team, and the drug's gangs that control the inner-city housing projects, this is the American dream gone bad - an unapologetically political insight into why the largely black underclass have been failed by the machinery of government.Season 3 takes us back to season 1's plot arc, as Stringer Bell holds temporary control of the `business' in Avon Barksdale's enforced absence. The times they are a changing as the towers are pulled down, and rival gangs fight for control of the corners. The tension between the two main men once Avon is released from prison, as each strives to impose his own vision (Stringer's to create a legitimate business empire, Avon's to let the street know who is king), leads to an unforgettable outcome. This leaves the door open for other crews to muscle in on their former territory, resulting in a bloodbath in West Baltimore. The Mayor and the Police Commissioner are desperate to keep the bodycount down as the election looms, leading to Major Colvin adopting his own eye-opening solution to the problem.Meanwhile McNulty continues to p**s off anyone who doesn't agree with his methods, Prez makes a fatal error of judgement and Omar carries on wielding his own unique brand of vigilante justice against Barksdale's crew.New characters Cutty, an ex-con fresh out of jail and fighting against the pull of the gang life, Tommy Carcetti, the ambitious councilman looking to run for mayor, and Marlo, the ambitious young gang leader looking to establish a foothold on the street, join the other established characters in a season that  first matches, and then exceeds the dizzying standard that The Wire had set itself in previous seasons.It's almost unheard of for television to achieve the artistic integrity of film or literature, and the Wire stands alone as an example of what is possible when a brilliant and passionate writer is allowed to realise his vision unfettered by the commercial constraints imposed by most networks.

Watching a season of The Wire on DVD is like spending time reading a good novel, and you can watch it at your own pace . ( In my case, over 2 days)The Wire is simply one of the best shows on TV. That said, I found season 3 somewhat disappointing in comparison the the brilliant first 2 seasons. The new aspect of Baltimore city life explored in season 3- city government/politics- is not as compelling as the  drug business/police storyline of season 1 and the dockworkers/international gangsters plot of season 2.The new characters introduced are not as compelling, either. The Bunny Colvin character is  appealing and well-acted, but his storyline is too predictable. The Carcetti character felt like a placeholder, as  his story arc didn't go much of anywhere. He will likely  become more significant in season 4, but too much time was wasted  on setting him up. The ""Cutty"" character's story was just plain boring. I'd  have preferred that  it be cut entirely  in order to expand other elements .While multiple characters and storylines were ably juggled in season 2, the writers seem  a bit overwhelmed with the new additions. Our old friends from season 1 and 2 get little attention and developments for their characters seem very rushed and  perfunctory ( ""Prez ""'s  in particular) And  is there ever enough Omar?The main problem with season 3 is that it is less a complete and satisfying season than  a  wrap up  of plotlines from seasons 1 and 2 and setup for season 4.However, I was still happy to spend 12 hours in this world, and I can't wait to see what happens next.Watch The Wire, buy the DVDs, keep this great show going.",5,Like a satisfying novel,1156118400,"08 21, 2006",2006,1825,"['believe', 'who', 'have', 'wait', 'DVD', 'releases', 'Wire', 'arrive', 'HBO', 'typical', 'tortoise-like', 'schedule', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'amply', 'rewarded', 'who', 'watch', 'TV', 'Watching', 'season', 'Wire', 'DVD', 'spending', 'time', 'reading', 'good', 'novel', 'can', 'watch', 'own', 'pace', 'case', '2', 'days', 'Wire', 'simply', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'TV', 'said', 'found', 'season', '3', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'comparison', 'brilliant', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'new', 'aspect', 'Baltimore', 'city', 'life', 'explored', 'season', '3-', 'city', 'government/politics-', 'not', 'as', 'compelling', 'drug', 'business/police', 'storyline', 'season', '1', 'dockworkers/international', 'gangsters', 'plot', 'season', '2.The', 'new', 'characters', 'introduced', 'are', 'not', 'compelling', 'either', 'Bunny', 'Colvin', 'character', 'appealing', 'well-acted', 'storyline', 'too', 'predictable', 'Carcetti', 'character', 'felt', 'placeholder', 'story', 'arc', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'much', 'anywhere', 'will', 'likely', 'become', 'more', 'significant', 'season', '4', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'wasted', 'setting', 'up', 'Cutty', 'character', 'story', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', ""'d"", 'have', 'preferred', 'be', 'cut', 'entirely', 'order', 'expand', 'other', 'elements', '.While', 'multiple', 'characters', 'storylines', 'were', 'ably', 'juggled', 'season', '2', 'writers', 'seem', 'bit', 'overwhelmed', 'new', 'additions', 'old', 'friends', 'season', '1', '2', 'get', 'little', 'attention', 'developments', 'characters', 'seem', 'very', 'rushed', 'perfunctory', 'Prez', 'particular', 'there', 'ever', 'enough', 'Omar', 'main', 'problem', 'season', '3', 'less', 'complete', 'satisfying', 'season', 'wrap', 'plotlines', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'setup', 'season', '4.However', 'was', 'still', 'happy', 'spend', '12', 'hours', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'next.Watch', 'Wire', 'buy', 'DVDs', 'keep', 'great', 'show', 'going']",The Wire: Season 3

You'll almost certainly need to watch the first episode at least a couple of times to make sense out of what's going on they have so many expository balls in the air at the same time. After this explosive beginning the show settles down into routine until the last two episodes where stuff starts to happen again. And that's the problem: the season has a huge sag in the middle where the three or four main strands of the story pretty well just tread water. For instance we keep on coming back to ""Hamsterdam"" where we are shown (again and again and again) controlled chaos in the street, cops standing around muttering in bemused tones, then they go on to something else, then back to Hamsterdam where we are shown controlled chaos in the street, cops standing around muttering in bemused tones, etc; almost exactly the same thing as before. This goes on for episode after episode until it comes time to wrap everything up at the end. And so it goes for all the other storylines: Stringer Bell's frustrated attempts to expand his horizons, McNulty's personal travails, Lestor Freamon's wiretapping endeavours, Tommy Carcetti's councilman-on-the-make manoeuvers, skullduggery and weaseling between the Mayor and Police Commissioner, etc. We keep on coming back and back and back and nothing has changed. Until those last two episodes.....Throughout the whole season ""gritty realism"" is laid on by the shovelful to the point where it threatens to become the raison-d'etre of the entire show. Pretty well everyone swears five times as much as they do in real life but, hey, that's HBO, baby! There's an omnipresent crassness to the tone with an obvious ""boys will be boys"" ironic finger-wagging attitude about the things McNulty and Bunk get up to and which we're obviously meant to find uproarious.

It all seems so fake as though the writers have concocted these episodes merely to give an ersatz ""colour"" to the characters. McNulty - I think - is supposed to be full of roguish charm. I say this because Dominic West (who play-acts his way through the role) keeps pulling faces and assuming expressions pantomimically suggestive of ""roguish charm"". He's the main weakness in a cast which contains a few excellent performances. Idris Elba as Stringer Bell doesn't seem to be performing at all; he just projects. And Wood Harris (Avon Barksdale) is almost as authentic while Aiden Gillen as Councillor Carcetti does a fine tight-mouthed Dustin Hoffman impression. Perhaps Michael K. Williams as Omar overdoes the ""outlaw"" element of the character but I love to watch the avenging devil go about creating mayhem.Anyway, I find it hard not to conclude that this is a ridiculously overrated series in view of raves like ""the most perfect thing in the history of television"" and ""the best show in the history of television"". Sure, it's often interesting but the BEST show in the HISTORY of television?!!!!!! My guess for this critical over-enthusiasm?: it offers an educated and probably not overly-streetwise audience the seemingly authentic vicarious thrill of hangin' with the homies without the attendant risk of actually having to do so.",4,Better than Season Two......,1303171200,"04 19, 2011",2011,3346,"['flaccid', 'Season', 'Two', 'one', 'bang', 'happily', ""n't"", 'quite', 'end', 'whimper', ""'ll"", 'almost', 'certainly', 'need', 'watch', 'first', 'episode', 'least', 'couple', 'times', 'make', 'sense', 'what', 'going', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'expository', 'balls', 'air', 'same', 'time', 'explosive', 'beginning', 'show', 'down', 'routine', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'where', 'stuff', 'happen', 'again', 'problem', 'season', 'huge', 'sag', 'middle', 'where', 'three', 'four', 'main', 'strands', 'story', 'pretty', 'well', 'just', 'tread', 'water', 'instance', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'Hamsterdam', 'where', 'are', 'shown', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'controlled', 'chaos', 'street', 'standing', 'around', 'muttering', 'bemused', 'tones', 'then', 'go', 'something', 'else', 'then', 'back', 'Hamsterdam', 'where', 'are', 'shown', 'controlled', 'chaos', 'street', 'standing', 'around', 'muttering', 'bemused', 'tones', 'etc', 'almost', 'exactly', 'same', 'thing', 'before', 'episode', 'episode', 'time', 'wrap', 'everything', 'up', 'end', 'other', 'storylines', 'Stringer', 'Bell', 'frustrated', 'attempts', 'expand', 'horizons', 'McNulty', 'personal', 'travails', 'Lestor', 'Freamon', 'wiretapping', 'endeavours', 'Tommy', 'Carcetti', 'councilman-on-the-make', 'manoeuvers', 'skullduggery', 'weaseling', 'Mayor', 'Police', 'Commissioner', 'etc', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'back', 'back', 'nothing', 'changed', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'whole', 'season', 'gritty', 'realism', 'laid', 'shovelful', 'point', 'where', 'become', ""raison-d'etre"", 'entire', 'show', 'Pretty', 'well', 'everyone', 'five', 'times', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'real', 'life', 'hey', 'HBO', 'baby', 'omnipresent', 'crassness', 'tone', 'obvious', 'boys', 'will', 'be', 'boys', 'ironic', 'finger-wagging', 'attitude', 'things', 'McNulty', 'Bunk', 'get', 'up', ""'re"", 'obviously', 'meant', 'find', 'uproarious', ""'m"", 'Animal', 'House-style', 'crudities', 'place', 'guys', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'style', 'so', 'fake', 'writers', 'have', 'concocted', 'episodes', 'merely', 'give', 'ersatz', 'colour', 'characters', 'McNulty', 'think', 'supposed', 'be', 'full', 'roguish', 'charm', 'say', 'Dominic', 'West', 'who', 'way', 'role', 'pulling', 'assuming', 'expressions', 'pantomimically', 'suggestive', 'roguish', 'charm', 'main', 'weakness', 'cast', 'few', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'Stringer', 'Bell', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'performing', 'just', 'projects', 'Wood', 'Harris', 'Avon', 'Barksdale', 'almost', 'authentic', 'Aiden', 'Gillen', 'Councillor', 'Carcetti', 'fine', 'tight-mouthed', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'impression', 'Perhaps', 'Michael', 'K.', 'Williams', 'Omar', 'outlaw', 'element', 'character', 'love', 'watch', 'avenging', 'devil', 'go', 'creating', 'mayhem.Anyway', 'find', 'hard', 'not', 'conclude', 'ridiculously', 'overrated', 'series', 'view', 'raves', 'most', 'perfect', 'thing', 'history', 'television', 'best', 'show', 'history', 'television', 'Sure', 'often', 'interesting', 'BEST', 'show', 'HISTORY', 'television', 'guess', 'critical', 'over-enthusiasm', 'educated', 'probably', 'not', 'overly-streetwise', 'audience', 'seemingly', 'authentic', 'vicarious', 'thrill', 'hangin', 'homies', 'attendant', 'risk', 'actually', 'having', 'do', 'so']",The Wire: Season 3

Much of the story is redundant and the series starts to morally preach rather than tell a realistic story. There is good stuff in the season, but its about half of the content.The good part of the season is the expansion of the series into the politics of city hall in Baltimore. The strength of the series overall is that it keeps adding to a ever-richer and more comprehensive view of the city by adding institutions and characters to the story. The understanding of how politics work in a city is first rate. The scripts ring true and all of the characters play to type. That is the good.On the other side, the idea of the wiretap investigation is played out. So is Stringer Bell and Avon Barksdale as characters. So are most of the police characters. There just isn't anywhere new to go with any of this stuff that they have not already done in the first two seasons.Equally bad is long blocks of the show devoted to lame ""message"" politics. The show basically plays out a ""what if"" with regard to legalization of drugs. But its completely contrived, false and idealized. Unlike most of whats in ""the wire"", everything assoicated with the subplot is basically garbage. Rather than show things in a realistic way as far as the positives and negatives of legalization, they are selling ""message"". There are ways a police captain might subvert the law for a while and create a defacto legalization of drugs. But the things shown in the wire are not how it would be done. A police captain could create an open-air drug market by selective enforcement. But a police captain could not create an open-air drug market guarded by the police and served by city social services.The scripts and the acting are all fine. But show stepped down from a high level of realism into preachy television message drama. And it may still be better than 90% of television drama, but the star grade I've given is in terms of the show in competition with itself. And this third season is nowhere near the quality level of the first two seasons.

The previous season, most of the show was focused on events surrounding the docks, but with season three, the series is shifted back to the streets as both sides of the war on drugs escalate to new methods in an effort to eliminate one another, and it's a war that no one is winning.  Avon Barksdale (Wood Harris) is out of jail and looking to reclaim what's his, even if it means going head to head with Stringer Bell (the excellent Idris Elba).  In the meantime, Detective Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West) finds his own life falling to pieces more and more, but it won't stop him from doing what he feels he needs to do.  Featuring a large ensemble cast, all of whom leave a lasting impretion (from Frankie Faison to Lance Reddick), the Wire is one of those rare accomplishments in the world of television that does so much right that it can't be put into words.  The Sopranos and other shows always get the spotlight from the real gems on HBO, and the Wire is one of those shows that deserves much more recognition than it's ever gotten.

995824,A1SV22OU1E7XRX,B000FTCLSU,ocarolan,"[5, 5]","Simply put, ""The Wire"" is the best series on TV, bar none. Individuals weaned on network programming may have a difficult time getting into this series because the story takes time to unfold, spans the entire season--segments are not neatly tied up--and because the writers treat the viewers as though they are intelligent. (I recently purchased Season One of the widely acclaimed ""24."" It turned out to be everything ""The Wire"" is not: artificial, contrived, shallow, and an insult to one's intelligence.)Filmed on location on Baltimore's mean streets, ""The Wire"" is driven by a rich cast of well-developed, complex, believable characters--politicians, cops, drug lords, street hustlers.  The casting is perfect and the acting some of the best you will see on TV.  I came away from this series feeling that it, more than any other TV programming that I had seen, portrayed both the street drug culture and the war on drugs--especially national, local, and police politics--as it really is.By the end of Season One, the main character, detective Jimmy McNulty, has run afoul of his superiors, and he is banished from working to bring down the Barksdale drug organization to the Baltimore PD's harbor patrol. This sets the stage for Season Two, which unfolds in the harbor setting and represents a distinct departure from the story line of Season One. Season Two ends with McNulty winning his way back onto the task force targeting Barksdale, setting the stage for Season Three. Thus, Season Three could be considered a continuation of Season One, with Season Two standing on its own. I watched the three seasons in sequence because (then) I had no choice. But if I had access to all three seasons, I'd have been sorely tempted to have gone from Season One to Season Three in my desire to see how the Barksdale story line played out. Then I'd have watched Season Two. This in no way is to meant to knock Season Two--it, too, is excellent--it is simply a reflection of how deeply Season One draws you into its story.  Does Season Three meet the high expectations set by Season One? It exceeded my expectations, and Season Three stands as my favorite of the three.

995825,A70YTUFJY5HXN,B000FTCLSU,Olukayode Balogun,"[129, 139]","HBO have at long last, decided to release this on DVD and thank goodness. The Wire is undoubtedly the best TV around these days since ""Homicide: Life on the Street"". No surprise then, I guess that the same man (David Simon) had/has a big hand in both series.Unlike most crime/cop shows that have a beginning, middle and end in the one episode, the story here is spread over the entire series. We're seeing stuff that kicked off in Season 1 still developing in Season 3. Some viewers find this challenging - this certainly isn't a show you can watch while cooking dinner or chatting to your buddies on the phone. It's sad that ratings have dropped though because if you give the show the undivided attention it deserves and focus on the story, complex as it is, the rewards are truly immense.After the drama on the docks that was the main focus of Season 2, Season 3 takes it back to the streets where we most like it. The Baltimore drug wars rage on, with Avon Barksdale, played by Wood Harris, out of jail to find his territory of corners under threat from young & ruthless upstart, Marlo, played utterly convincingly by Jamie Hector. Stringer Bell has held things down while Avon's been away but his methods have been questionable, to put things mildly. Stringer gets his comeuppance this season though and as much as I hated the character - and admired Idris Elba for playing it so well - I honestly didn't see his comeuppance coming in the way it eventually did. Scorching scriptwriting!The police are desperately trying to keep up. Major ""Bunny"" Colvin, played by Robert Wisdom, comes up with the 'brilliant' idea of creating a 'safe zone' for drug sale and use in the city and this area gets dubbed Amsterdam. The plan seems to work - the rest of the city suddenly becomes a haven - but Colvin keeps the project from his superiors. The results are disastrous, for him and for the city.Meanwhile, the detail is back on the hunt and as we watch them chase their tails, the questions left hanging in the air are what is this so-called war on drugs about, exactly? And who is winning?In the background, meanwhile, there's scheming, wrangling and backstabbing in the corridors of the city political powers. Unlike the stuff on ""The West Wing"" this is the kind of politics I can get into and this is a story that is going to run and run.Like any TV show, this one has its 'stars' but this is truly an ensemble performance. Everyone, whether it's by playing a starring role, a recurring role, bit part or even an extra, gets to contribute a crucial part of the jigsaw that makes up the big picture.Still, I must mention some of my favourite performers. Apart from those already mentioned, they include: Lance Reddick, an actor with the ability to convey more with a single look than most actors can with a whole minute of dialogue, as Lieutenant Daniels; Dominick West, who plays Detective Jimmy McNutly, a cop who races to save the world while his own life crumbles around him; Sonja Sohn, who plays Detective Kima Greggs, McNulty's loyal partner, who realises she's not as ready for a life of domesticity with her girlfriend and their baby as she had originally thought; Andre Royo, who plays Bubbles the 'co-operative' drug fiend with heart; Michael K. Williams, who plays Omar the gay gangster with a shotgun - something I never thought I'd see on TV in my lifetime; Frankie Faison and John Doman who play Commissioner Burrell and Deputy Commissioner Rawls respectively (for some reason, neither fails to make me laugh out loud with every line they deliver); Michael Hyatt, who plays Brianna Barksdale, mother of D'Angelo (who was murdered in Season 2) and sister to kingpin Avon; and last but by no means least, the 'dynamic' duo Detectives Herc and Carver, played wonderfully by Dominick Lombardozzi and (the beautiful) Seth Gilliam respectively.And then there's Chad L. Coleman as Dennis ""Cutty"" Wise, the ex-con who finds he no longer has the stomach for the streets. He turns to volunteering, running a youth boxing gym. Here's an actor to look out for and he brings an intensity to his role that I found mesmerising. I hope we get to see more of him in future Seasons.This is a totally believable drama with cracking dialogue and nary a cliche or stereotype to be seen. The reactions to the show, both positive and negative just go to show how a gritty and realistic drama series can hit home.This is a must for any connoisseur of mature and thought provoking TV. This is one show that takes a long, unapologetic and uncompromising look at an underclass we would all prefer to ignore and thus, while it's not always pretty, it is always riveting. If you don't have seasons 1 & 2, I recommend you get them now. This one of very few shows I am able to watch over and over and not get bored, learning and appreciating something new each time. I am placing my pre-order for Season 3 forthwith!",5,Great news!

Varine ""Make beats, not war, haha...""","[3, 3]","I'd love to delve into all of the facets of ""The Wire,"" but there just isn't enough space.What I can say is thank Jeebus that it's coming back for another season (just heard about its renewal for a fifth and, I believe, final season).To try and encapsulate what the third season is about really will not do it justice, but the focus is certainly back on the streets. Avon Barksdale, having schemed his way into an early release from Jessup Correctional, is coming back home, where his right-hand man, the magnetic, engaging Stringer Bell, has been running so serious a business that he can buy legit cribs for himself and Avon; in fact, one of the beauty moments in this season is seeing Stringer's business-man persona put in check when he tries his hand at political persuasion.The central struggle, as usual, is the drug trade: mandates are coming from the department to reduce crime OR ELSE. One particularly affecting scene is watching the mayor and police commissioner debate, almost glibly, about how many homicides it will take before the two experience political fallout (""300 is too many... now, if you can do 275...? That's something we can live with.""). You could tell this season that politics and political figures are going to have a much bigger role in future episodes. The cutthroat race for mayor, I think, is really going to heat up in the next season.And it's no fair to spill the biggest surprise of the season, even though it's just a one-second shot of Captain Rawls. Can't WAIT to see what they do with THAT in the fourth season.I'm not sure if there's any way a police commander could get away with what Maj. Bunnie Colvin tries to get away with in this season, but it's certainly an interesting take on fighting the violence that often accompanies the drug war.Add in a healthy dose of my main man Omar, turf beef with a young up-and-comer in the drug trade and the death of a character who will be universally missed, and you have another volatile, staggeringly earnest portrayal of class conflict, the war on drugs and, in creator David Simon's words, 'the America that America doesn't need.'HBO may charge two arms and a leg for their series (personally, I prefer to rent 'em on Netflix), but if one is worth it, it's ""The Wire.""",4,Almost too complex to write a review,1159488000,"09 29, 2006",2006,2258,"[""'d"", 'love', 'delve', 'facets', 'Wire', 'just', ""n't"", 'enough', 'can', 'say', 'thank', 'Jeebus', 'coming', 'back', 'season', 'just', 'heard', 'renewal', 'fifth', 'believe', 'final', 'season', 'try', 'encapsulate', 'what', 'third', 'season', 'really', 'will', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'focus', 'certainly', 'back', 'streets', 'Avon', 'Barksdale', 'having', 'schemed', 'way', 'early', 'release', 'Jessup', 'Correctional', 'coming', 'back', 'home', 'where', 'right-hand', 'man', 'magnetic', 'engaging', 'Stringer', 'Bell', 'been', 'running', 'so', 'serious', 'business', 'can', 'buy', 'legit', 'cribs', 'Avon', 'fact', 'one', 'beauty', 'moments', 'season', 'seeing', 'Stringer', 'business-man', 'persona', 'put', 'check', 'when', 'hand', 'political', 'persuasion.The', 'central', 'struggle', 'usual', 'drug', 'trade', 'mandates', 'are', 'coming', 'department', 'reduce', 'crime', 'OR', 'ELSE', 'One', 'particularly', 'affecting', 'scene', 'watching', 'mayor', 'police', 'commissioner', 'debate', 'almost', 'glibly', 'how', 'many', 'homicides', 'will', 'take', 'two', 'experience', 'political', 'fallout', '300', 'too', 'many', 'now', 'can', 'do', '275', 'something', 'can', 'live', 'with.', 'could', 'tell', 'season', 'politics', 'political', 'figures', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'much', 'bigger', 'role', 'future', 'episodes', 'cutthroat', 'race', 'mayor', 'think', 'really', 'going', 'heat', 'up', 'next', 'season.And', 'fair', 'spill', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'season', 'even', 'just', 'one-second', 'shot', 'Captain', 'Rawls', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'WAIT', 'see', 'what', 'do', 'THAT', 'fourth', 'season.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'way', 'police', 'commander', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'what', 'Maj.', 'Bunnie', 'Colvin', 'get', 'away', 'season', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'take', 'fighting', 'violence', 'often', 'drug', 'war.Add', 'healthy', 'dose', 'main', 'man', 'Omar', 'turf', 'beef', 'young', 'up-and-comer', 'drug', 'trade', 'death', 'character', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'universally', 'missed', 'have', 'volatile', 'staggeringly', 'earnest', 'portrayal', 'class', 'conflict', 'war', 'drugs', 'creator', 'David', 'Simon', 'words', 'America', 'America', ""n't"", 'need', ""'HBO"", 'may', 'charge', 'two', 'arms', 'leg', 'series', 'personally', 'prefer', 'rent', 'Netflix', 'one', 'Wire']",The Wire: Season 3

You can't buy that kind of script anywhere.

I kept reading so many great things about it, so I had to check it out for myself.  By the end of Season One I was hooked!

This series gives those characters depth and complexity unlike anything I've ever seen.  And the cops and politicians of Baltimore who also play a prominent role in the series are just as compelling and multi-dimensional.

Though Barksdale is getting out of prison, which he partially engineered, his partner String has moved forward and begun a career as a developer with their drug profits.  This lands them smack in the middle of Baltimore politics, an arena in which they are neophytes.  String is also striving to create a more organized crime syndicate with old-rival Prop Joe.  Barksdale and String are also becoming suspicious of eachother, potentially ending a life-long partnership with deadly machinations.  Meanwhile, there is a new enemy on the horizon,  a young lion named Marlo who is willing to break the rules to get ahead; he is as cold as his rivals and exceedingly dangerous.  Finally, the politicians move to the center stage, in an unusual election campaign in which a white councilman attempts to split the black vote between the inept mayor and a young turk who is a personal friend.  This is the best dramatic tableau I have ever seen on TV.  Perhaps most astonishing for me, who never considered drug legalization a good option, was to get me to question my convictions.The cops are somewhat more in the background on this one, but the team's case is very much alive.  The suspense in maintained right up to the end, which ends the first 3 seasons as a clear unit.  There are also many sub-themes, such as the code of the violent Omar, but also the disillusioned cop who pursues a kind of creation of legal zones to deal drugs.

This show continues to set new standards for writing and capturing the infuriating insanity that defines the American war on drugs.While the major players of ""The Wire"" are back for a third season, and they all get their fair share of screen time, Season Three is dominated by a new character, Major Howard ""Bunny"" Colvin (Robert Wisdom).  Word has come down from the Mayor's office that Baltimore's crime stats need to drop - fast.  Major Colvin is close to retirement at his full Major's pension after 30 years on the force, and he is sick of the hypocrisy and the wasted effort that causes the war on drugs to go nowhere.And so he proposes something drastic to restore sanity to Baltimore's streets.  He creates three ""free zones,"" called Amsterdam, where drugs can be bought, sold, and used without police enforcement.  These zones are located in virtually empty blocks - Colvin's thought is that if all the drug trade is there and there is no worry of police, then the dealers and the users will leave the rest of the city alone, and the violent turf wars will stop.It's no secret that Colvin's efforts will ultimately fail - ""The Wire"" is too smart a show to allow for a simple effort to solve all problems.  But what makes this season so compelling is that we get to see the good and the bad of Colvin's idea . . . as well as the train wreck it becomes when the story goes public.This season of ""The Wire"" focuses as much on Baltimore's corrupt politics as it does on the streets.  Look for plenty of riveting scenes and lots of ""inside baseball"" as politicos jockey for headlines while protecting their behinds.But also look for lots of development of the long-time cast of ""The Wire"" as relationships grow and deepen.

The intercoiled plotlines, the emergence of some of the actors into greatness with their roles (Lance Reddick as Cedreic Daniels and Idris Elba as 'Stringer' Bell) plus a pair of bombshells regarding Det. 'Prez' Pryzbylewski (Jim True-Frost) and Commander Rawls (John Doman), and this made season three just stunning all the way around.The focus on this season was politics and power, with the high power and the low. The Mayor sees trouble in his polling, so he makes the demand that crime stats must drop...or else. Stringer Bell needs to build his empire up and away from drugs while Avon barksdale is in jail, so he forms a coalition to sell dope while going straight...without Avon's knowledge.

All the main activity thus revolves around ""Hamsterdam's"" rise and inevitable fall.Along with the subplots that bring back Omar, Bubbles, Brodie, Attny Gen Rhonda, Brother Mouzone, Bunk and the rest make their mark. There's humor, suspense and an a tightly written story that picks up unbeliveable momentum as the store gets to the last three episodes.

995855,A1RW4DRDC4U9PU,B000FTCLSU,Timothy Price,"[13, 13]","It's criminal the amount of people that watch the best drama on television, ""The Wire."" I started watching because of David Simon. The man wrote the book that ultimately became my favorite TV show of all time, ""Homicide: Life on the Street."" I quickly became a huge fan, and theres a number of reasons why.The writing for ""The Wire"" is nothing short of incredible. It's not written by ""TV Writers"" but more experienced authors and this makes quite a difference. A season of The Wire unfolds like a great novel. As each episode goes by, the greater the story builds. Its full of amazing characters and has many special touches and little nuances that are a joy to watch. The cast is fantastic and all the actors do a wonderful job.I think what many people tend to miss is the importance of the storylines and the issues that David Simon and his team are addressing. In season 3 the storyline of Major Bunny Colvin ""decriminalising"" drugs in a certain area of his district was an amazing look at the world of crime and drugs. It was such an incredible storyline, because it wasn't black and white. An amazing hypothetical that leaves me thinking to this day.The Wire is television at its very best, it also demands a lot from the viewer. Its definitely worth repeat viewing of the episodes. If you put the time in to notice the detail of the show it is extremely rewarding. The intricate storylines, complex characters, and revealing insights into life and instituitions are waiting for your viewership. This DVD is a must own.

995859,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B000FTCLSU,Wheelchair Assassin,"[12, 12]","For those who weren't put off by The Wire's unflinching depictions of violence, drug use, profanity, and urban decay, the show takes a new and frightening direction in season three.  Yes, the first two seasons of The Wire dealt with some heavy subject matter, but some of the content of this season may be dark and depressing enough to make even the show's most loyal and unflappable viewers turn away in horror.  Yes, season three of The Wire sees the best show of all time venturing into the corrupt, depraved arena of politics, and once you go down that road you never come back.  For the first time, fans of the show get a look at those roaming the halls of power not just in the Baltimore Police Department (though there is a great deal of that) but of the city itself.  What goes on in the mayor's office, the City Council chamber, and the police headquarters isn't always a pretty picture--even the drug game seems to have more room for loyalty and honor than the political game--but the show's newfound emphasis on political maneuvering does contribute to its evolution from a crime drama with elements of social commentary to a full-fledged urban drama with (according to David Simon) heavy inspiration in Greek tragedy.  And we should all be grateful for it, as it helps further The Wire's claim as the most relevant and challenging show yet to hit TV.  I don't vote and tend to wonder why so many people concern themselves with politics, but The Wire approaches the subject with such a personal and philosophical emphasis that even the most apolitical viewer should be riveted.Of course, it's not all politics, as pretty much every character viewers know and love from season one is still in play, and there's plenty of violent action and intricate electronic investigating to be found.  After shifting focus for a season to examine crime along East Baltimore's docks, The Wire in season three finds the Major Crimes Unit once again pursuing the drug empire of Avon Barksdale and Stringer Bell, whose damaging bust at the end of season one has left them even more cautious and (in the case of Stringer) looking to make some inroads into legitimate business.  Stringer isn't the only one looking to make some changes either, as season three's predominant theme is the idea of reform, whether it be personal or political, in the ghettoes or in the city government.  Naturally, as experienced viewers might expect, reform in the morally ambiguous world of The Wire is a tricky concept, often temporary or illusory, much talked about but difficult to actually attain.  Not to mention, all talk of reform aside, Baltimore is still a dangerous place, with cops, fueding drug crews, and freelance criminals thrown together in a limited space with a set of shifting agendas and alliances that practically guarantees they'll come into conflict.Season three introduces several key new characters, all of whom are seamlessly integrated into The Wire's ever-expanding universe--Tommy Carcetti (Aiden Gillen), a calculating city councilman whose occasional idealism does little to temper his ambitions; Dennis ""Cutty"" Wise (Chad L. Coleman), a newly-freed ex-con trying with mixed success to go straight; Marlo Stanfield (Jamie Hector), an almost cartoonishly evil drug dealer who decides to take on the Barksdale empire; and Maj. Howard ""Bunny"" Colvin (Robert Wisdom), the Western district commander who decides to try a decidedly unconventional and controversial approach to prevent his command from being overrun by drug dealers.  The infusion of new blood helps bring The Wire's ""visual novel"" approach to its fullest fruition yet, with the show juggling a huge (and brilliantly portrayed) cast of characters and multiple intersecting plot strands, many of which build on the events of the preceding two seasons.  The Wire may be the best example yet of why cable is the home to such a disproportionate share of TV's most highly regarded shows--only on a network like HBO, where a show's creators are allowed to plan for the long term, would a show with The Wire's level of future orientation be able to survive.  Even in season three, we're still seeing the payoff of plot elements that were introduced in the first two seasons, thanks to Simon and co.'s unbelievably meticulous and deliberate plotting.  Everything that happens has its purpose, even if it's not always apparent right away, and the  fierce intelligence and complexity of the writing is bolstered by the ingenious use of crime novelists to author several of the episodes.  The attention to detail is way beyond anything else I've seen on TV; there's just so much going on in these episodes it defies easy summation.  Even with the expanding cast, the characters are kept multifaceted and relatable, and more than ever before the show elevates conversation to high art, with dialogue laden with authenticity and humor througout--be it the relentlessly inventive and colorful slang of street criminals, the slick pandering of politicians, or the world-weary philosophizing of seasoned cops.At all times, maximum belivability is the objective, making this season, even more so than the first two, into a microcosm of the world at large.  Whatever your stance on the more politically provocative aspects of this season, the writers almost make it difficult to condone or condemn anyone too vociferously because the reasons for their actions are always thoroughly explored and explained.  The Wire has been described from its beginning as an examination of the effects of institutions on individuals, and Bunny Colvin's plan for dealing with the war on drugs through a policy of accomodation that borders on outright legalization allows the show to broaden and intensify its gaze to illustrate why such a bold idea will never be allowed to take hold in a major American city.  As is generally the case, especially with the War on Drugs, innovation and rationality are inevitably suppressed by an entrenched and inflexible bureaucracy for a simple reason--too many people have a stake in preserving the status quo.  Colvin's idea may be a good one-and to its great credit, the show lets us see both its positive and negative aspects-but it's far too dangerous to those in power to be allowed to proceed.Still, while it may not always be an easy show to watch, and it doesn't offer much in the way of happy endings, in this reviewer's opinion The Wire still represents the very best American TV has to offer.  Even the best shows I've seen-The Shield, The Sopranos, The Simpsons-have shown some chinks in their armor over the years, but The Wire consistently holds up to analysis, even when I've started proactively looking for flaws while watching.  The recent fourth season took the show in even more new thematic directions, with a great deal of success, but I think this season establishes the best balance between The Wire's crime-drama origins and its increasingly ambitious current incarnation.  Of course, the forthcoming fifth (and supposedly final season) could end up rendering the discussion of the show's best season irrelevant.  Loyal viewers should already be getting all tingly at the thought.",5,The best season yet.
