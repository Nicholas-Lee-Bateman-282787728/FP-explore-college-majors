Season 3 consists of 3 discs with Episodes 1-4 on Disc 1, Episodes 5-8 on Disc 2, and Episodes 9-11 on Disc 3. This setup is much better than Season 2 which had 5 discs and 2 separate cases. The episodes also have closed captioning on them for the hearing impaired.

""Cole""","[1, 1]","As you can infer from the title, I am in firm belief that the final half of the season 3 is in contention for quite possibly the most memorable piece of TAR history.  With incidents like ""Dieselgate"" (where teams filled their diesel vehicles with unleaded [leading to disastrous results]) and Flo's maniacal breakdown, the season became one that shocked and surprised me, kept me on the edge of my seat, and had me screaming and cheering at the TV more than what is considered normal.  As with all seasons, there were a couple of teams that were duds and were just waiting to get eliminated but for the most part, the teams selected showed great chemistry and were very enjoyable to watch.  I will say that Flo (of team Zach and Flo) WILL make you cringe at times and I agree with another reviewer who said it best, it is simply quite painful to watch her compete. Season three is a classic season and an enjoyable trip around the world.",5,The final half of the season competes as one of the best segments in TAR history,1338681600,"06 3, 2012",2012,937,"['can', 'infer', 'title', 'am', 'firm', 'belief', 'final', 'half', 'season', '3', 'contention', 'quite', 'possibly', 'most', 'memorable', 'piece', 'TAR', 'history', 'incidents', 'Dieselgate', 'where', 'teams', 'filled', 'diesel', 'vehicles', 'unleaded', '[', 'leading', 'disastrous', 'results', ']', 'Flo', 'maniacal', 'breakdown', 'season', 'became', 'one', 'shocked', 'surprised', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'had', 'screaming', 'cheering', 'TV', 'more', 'what', 'considered', 'normal', 'seasons', 'were', 'couple', 'teams', 'were', 'duds', 'were', 'just', 'waiting', 'get', 'eliminated', 'most', 'part', 'teams', 'selected', 'showed', 'great', 'chemistry', 'were', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'will', 'say', 'Flo', 'team', 'Zach', 'Flo', 'WILL', 'make', 'cringe', 'times', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'best', 'simply', 'quite', 'painful', 'watch', 'compete', 'Season', 'three', 'classic', 'season', 'enjoyable', 'trip', 'world']",The Amazing Race: Season 3

In the process, they have challenges  to do and pushes them to their limits. This really is a good season. There are teams that you love, and teams that you love to hate.I've read a lot of complaints on the discs. My copy is fine. I didn't have any problems with the discs freezing or skipping, and were in working order. The only small issues is that when it came to the spot where a commercial breaks were. I lost the sound, or it was grubbily.

Hopefully we will see seasons 5 & 6 released soon. Very happy over all with the releases...except for the fact that these ar MOD products...WE WANT ACTUAL IN STORE RELEASES!!!About the DVD...The packaging makes a lot more sense than the season 2 release last february. This set has has three discs with disc 1 having episodes 1-4. Disc 2 has episodes 5-8. Disc 3 has episodes 9-11. The picture and sound quality is beautiful! The cover art however is lame compared to the covers of season 1 & 7...it honestly seems like someone got lazy while designing it! Something i was really disapointed in was the bonus features and extras....THERE WERE NONE!!! Because of the bonus features and cover art is why i rated it 4 stars.About the Show... ***SPOILER ALERT***This season definetly ranks in my top 5 along with seasons 6, 7, 14, 16. Its so much more interesting in the older seasons when the teams had to figure out where to go rather than just being told. Something i thought was unfair was in episode 3 when Andrew & Dennis were in about 3rd place...they decided to do the fast forward yet it was soo far away that they came in last place and were eliminated.....what??NOW COME ON AMAZON AND CBS...PLEASE RELEASE MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!",4,"YESS!!!!!
