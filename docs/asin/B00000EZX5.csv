The ending just doesn't feel right if you are familiar with the game, since Donovan is commonly regarded as the weakest one (like Dan in the Street Fighter series).",4,"Nice work, but shouldn't they change the hero?",988761600,"05 2, 2001",2001,515,"['animation', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'bringing', 'game', 'world', 'screen', 'However', 'put', 'most', 'characters', 'Vampire', '/', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', '/', 'Vampire', 'Savior', 'stage', 'inevitable', 'be', 'fragmented', 'way.For', 'will', 'be', 'huch', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'put', 'Demitori', '/', 'Morrigan', '/', 'Jedah', 'main', 'character', 'not', 'Donovan', 'ending', 'just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'are', 'familiar', 'game', 'Donovan', 'commonly', 'regarded', 'weakest', 'one', 'Dan', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'series']",N/A

496178,A2AOC1GWSMD42O,B00000EZX5,Mad Track,"[7, 7]","I gave this DVD 5 stars because it is SO much better than the American-adapted version (""Out of the Shadow"" and ""Battle Storm"").  I remember watching the American version during Saturday morning cartoon, and it was awful!  Like who the heck is this Harry guy?  And why does he and Felicia has some sort of relationship going on?  It was confusing and terrible.This version is much better.  More violence, more gore, more action, better graphics and (slightly) better storyline.  If I remember correctly, there are several key developments...the threat of Pyron, Felicia helping out the humans, and Donovan's lonesome fight with his inner-demon.  There are indeed a lot of characters who got left out -- Sasquatch, Victor, Lilith, Anakaris, Jedah, Rikuo, etc.What I thought they should do was expand on it and make it into a long-running OAV series (like Gundam or *gasp* DragonBall).  The reason is because there are just WAY too many characters and every fan wants to see his/her favorite!  Each character is powerful in its own way, so I don't like how this movie shows Pyron beating up others so quickly.  Furthermore, I felt like the movie gave too much ""power"" to Donovan and made Felicia look like a helpless kitten.  I really hope that someone picks up on this classic and make a good running series on it.",5,Much better version!,1112486400,"04 3, 2005",2005,1313,"['gave', 'DVD', '5', 'stars', 'SO', 'much', 'better', 'American-adapted', 'version', 'Shadow', 'Battle', 'Storm', 'remember', 'watching', 'American', 'version', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'was', 'awful', 'who', 'heck', 'Harry', 'guy', 'why', 'Felicia', 'sort', 'relationship', 'going', 'was', 'confusing', 'terrible.This', 'version', 'much', 'better', 'More', 'violence', 'more', 'gore', 'more', 'action', 'better', 'graphics', 'slightly', 'better', 'storyline', 'remember', 'correctly', 'are', 'several', 'key', 'developments', 'threat', 'Pyron', 'Felicia', 'helping', 'out', 'humans', 'Donovan', 'lonesome', 'fight', 'inner-demon', 'are', 'indeed', 'lot', 'characters', 'who', 'got', 'left', 'out', 'Sasquatch', 'Victor', 'Lilith', 'Anakaris', 'Jedah', 'Rikuo', 'thought', 'should', 'do', 'was', 'expand', 'make', 'long-running', 'OAV', 'series', 'Gundam', '*gasp*', 'DragonBall', 'reason', 'are', 'just', 'WAY', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'fan', 'see', 'his/her', 'favorite', 'character', 'powerful', 'own', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'movie', 'Pyron', 'beating', 'up', 'others', 'so', 'quickly', 'Furthermore', 'felt', 'movie', 'gave', 'too', 'much', 'power', 'Donovan', 'made', 'Felicia', 'look', 'helpless', 'kitten', 'really', 'hope', 'someone', 'up', 'classic', 'make', 'good', 'running', 'series']",N/A

The animation, story and characters are just as good in the second installment of this great anime. The story follows directly from the end of Alpha so if you are getting Omega you really should see Alpha first (if only to understand why the characters are doing what they are).This was a great finish to the OVA but the ending left you wondering if there would be more to follow.

I was expecting more of a team up battle with the final battle with Pyron but what they did was not much of an epic ending. Still the over all animation and story is great. The ending did leave a lot of question, which could be a reason to make more episodes, especially with all the character from Vampire Savior but no dice.A side story that went on was Felicia trying to save the town with the help Talbain from the Huitzil. It would have been great to see more of their tag team action. They did do a montage of Pyron beating up some of the other Darkstalkers, which was more of a let down. They could have devoted more time to some of those battles.Still, if you seen Alpha, you need to get Omega. You can watch Omega without Alpha but you will be missing some epic battles.",5,Needed more eps,1352246400,"11 7, 2012",2012,930,"['enjoyed', 'DVD', 'most', 'part', 'ending', 'seemed', 'be', 'bit', 'rush', 'job', 'left', 'question', 'what', 'happen', 'Donovan', 'end', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'team', 'up', 'battle', 'final', 'battle', 'Pyron', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'epic', 'ending', 'Still', 'animation', 'story', 'great', 'ending', 'did', 'leave', 'lot', 'question', 'could', 'be', 'reason', 'make', 'more', 'episodes', 'especially', 'character', 'Vampire', 'Savior', 'dice.A', 'side', 'story', 'went', 'was', 'Felicia', 'trying', 'save', 'town', 'help', 'Talbain', 'Huitzil', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'see', 'more', 'tag', 'team', 'action', 'did', 'do', 'montage', 'Pyron', 'beating', 'up', 'other', 'Darkstalkers', 'was', 'more', 'let', 'down', 'could', 'have', 'devoted', 'more', 'time', 'battles.Still', 'seen', 'Alpha', 'need', 'get', 'Omega', 'can', 'watch', 'Omega', 'Alpha', 'will', 'be', 'missing', 'epic', 'battles']",N/A

Granted, the first volume wasn't anymore great at introducing them, the second one seems to just pour character after  character onto the screen for video game fans to drool over. But all that  aside, Vol. 2 of this series is awesome because of it's one saving  grace...original characters that can really fight. The action sequences are  just flat out eye candy for any Darkstalker or Anime fan. Don't pay too  much attention to the plot and you'll be fine (Note-the story seems rushed  at the end). The dialouge also seems a little funny because of the mention  of &quot;The Dark&quot; in every sentence and the philosophical aura behind  each word some characters say (i.e. Donovan)comes off meaningful at some  points, yet will leave you scratching your head saying &quot;huh&quot; at  others.
