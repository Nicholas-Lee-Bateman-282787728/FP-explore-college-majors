934891,A2M3XJCBBMYQTQ,B000AYEL10,A. Brown,"[3, 4]","In his review of ""Last Days,"" Roger Ebert said it is ""a definitive record of death by gradual drug exhaustion. After the chills and thrills of 'Sid & Nancy' and 'The Doors,' here is a movie that sees how addicts usually die, not with a bang but a whimper.""Ebert is right, and it's why this film works so well in my opinion.  My girfriend was bored to the point of anger while watching this. I was transfixed.I fully understand why some will be bored.  Nothing much happens here.  The camera crawls around a lot, seemingly uninterested in its subjects, meandering here and pausing there for no apparent reason.  The ""star"" Blake barely utters a sentence.  Supporting characters come and go without consequence or explanation.  They talk at Blake sometimes, but we come to realize no one can talk ""to"" him.Blake is utterly lost and alone, and if the film's point is to make us share in that experience, it is successful.  Kim Gordon's character is the only one to make a real attempt at ""saving"" Blake from himself, but by that point we already know that he is beyond redemption.Several movies have been made about addiction, some good, some bad.  Last Days may be impossible to describe in such terms.  It is, however, highly effective.  It's only fault may be that it's far ""too real"" for the average Hollywood-fed consumer to digest.",4,Too real for most,1257379200,"11 5, 2009",2009,1334,"['review', 'Last', 'Days', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'said', 'definitive', 'record', 'death', 'gradual', 'drug', 'exhaustion', 'chills', 'thrills', ""'Sid"", 'Nancy', 'Doors', 'here', 'movie', 'how', 'addicts', 'usually', 'die', 'not', 'bang', 'whimper', 'Ebert', 'right', 'why', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'opinion', 'girfriend', 'was', 'bored', 'point', 'anger', 'watching', 'was', 'transfixed.I', 'fully', 'understand', 'why', 'will', 'be', 'bored', 'Nothing', 'much', 'happens', 'here', 'camera', 'lot', 'seemingly', 'uninterested', 'subjects', 'meandering', 'here', 'pausing', 'there', 'apparent', 'reason', 'star', 'Blake', 'barely', 'sentence', 'Supporting', 'characters', 'come', 'go', 'consequence', 'explanation', 'talk', 'Blake', 'sometimes', 'come', 'realize', 'one', 'can', 'talk', 'him.Blake', 'utterly', 'lost', 'alone', 'film', 'point', 'make', 'share', 'experience', 'successful', 'Kim', 'Gordon', 'character', 'only', 'one', 'make', 'real', 'attempt', 'saving', 'Blake', 'point', 'already', 'know', 'redemption.Several', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'addiction', 'good', 'bad', 'Last', 'Days', 'may', 'be', 'impossible', 'describe', 'such', 'terms', 'however', 'highly', 'effective', 'only', 'fault', 'may', 'be', 'far', 'too', 'real', 'average', 'Hollywood-fed', 'consumer', 'digest']",Gus Van Sant's Last Days
934892,A1KSO56UWS2R7I,B000AYEL10,"Adam L. Safianow ""Kiddo""","[3, 6]","I have read a lot of the other reader's reviews, and the reason why they scored this movie so low is not because of Gus Van Sant's film making abilities, or Michael Pitt's performance, or any elements of film that were missing, it is because they went into this film expecting to find about more about how and why and if Kurt Cobain was really crazy, if he was mentally ill and committed suicide, or there was some kind of external force.There are still many speculations on how and why he died, there are many books about it, I recommend reading those over seeing this film if those are the reasons for seeing this, but if you are looking for a movie with a great atmosphere, a really powerful movie about isolationism, character development, and overexhaustion of depression, than this film is right for you.Michael Pitt did an amazing performance as Blake, who represents the much acclaimed lead singer of Nirvana, Kurt Cobain, and he isolates himself in the outhouse of his own home, while people are trying to find him and question his random disappearence, just as his band is starting to hit it big.  He is wrapped up in his own problems, and he has not only cut himself from society, but locked himself in his own world, and his own music.  This movie is very slow, and all of the characters are fictional representations of real people, but the directing in the movie was top notch.  The same director of Good Will Hunting, Gus Van Sant, and he gives you this very gloomy and ominous atmosphere throughout the whole movie.  He hints out it the whole time.There was once scene where the TV was on, and you could see recorded footage of what happened the day Cobain shot himself.  Another scene had some guy tell this 'fictional story' to this other guy, which was really the story of Cobain.  Little touches here any there not only embrace the person watching, but nudges them on to inevitable show you what happened.If you're into good film, this is a great choice.  Nirvana fans MAY or MAY NOT be disappointed with the film, but unless all you watch are shallow films, this film is phenominal.",4,Met My Expectations,1135296000,"12 23, 2005",2005,2103,"['have', 'read', 'lot', 'other', 'reader', 'reviews', 'reason', 'why', 'scored', 'movie', 'so', 'low', 'not', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'film', 'making', 'abilities', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'performance', 'elements', 'film', 'were', 'missing', 'went', 'film', 'expecting', 'find', 'more', 'how', 'why', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'was', 'really', 'crazy', 'was', 'mentally', 'ill', 'committed', 'suicide', 'was', 'kind', 'external', 'force.There', 'are', 'still', 'many', 'speculations', 'how', 'why', 'died', 'are', 'many', 'books', 'recommend', 'reading', 'seeing', 'film', 'are', 'reasons', 'seeing', 'are', 'looking', 'movie', 'great', 'atmosphere', 'really', 'powerful', 'movie', 'isolationism', 'character', 'development', 'overexhaustion', 'depression', 'film', 'right', 'you.Michael', 'Pitt', 'did', 'amazing', 'performance', 'Blake', 'who', 'much', 'acclaimed', 'lead', 'singer', 'Nirvana', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'outhouse', 'own', 'home', 'people', 'are', 'trying', 'find', 'question', 'random', 'disappearence', 'just', 'band', 'starting', 'hit', 'big', 'wrapped', 'up', 'own', 'problems', 'not', 'only', 'cut', 'society', 'locked', 'own', 'world', 'own', 'music', 'movie', 'very', 'slow', 'characters', 'are', 'fictional', 'representations', 'real', 'people', 'directing', 'movie', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'same', 'director', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'very', 'gloomy', 'ominous', 'atmosphere', 'whole', 'movie', 'whole', 'time.There', 'was', 'once', 'scene', 'where', 'TV', 'was', 'could', 'see', 'recorded', 'footage', 'what', 'happened', 'day', 'Cobain', 'shot', 'scene', 'had', 'guy', 'tell', ""'fictional"", 'story', 'other', 'guy', 'was', 'really', 'story', 'Cobain', 'Little', 'touches', 'here', 'there', 'not', 'only', 'embrace', 'person', 'watching', 'inevitable', 'show', 'what', 'happened.If', ""'re"", 'good', 'film', 'great', 'choice', 'Nirvana', 'fans', 'MAY', 'MAY', 'NOT', 'be', 'disappointed', 'film', 'watch', 'are', 'shallow', 'films', 'film', 'phenominal']",Gus Van Sant's Last Days

Minutes turn into hours, but the moment never comes. If you are a fan of Cobain's you might begin to grow angry at the mindless portrayal of Kurt who just wanders silently about, incapable of expressing himself in more than one syllable, repeatedly falling over his own feet, meandering about in women's clothing, totally wacked out on some unknown chemical substance. He mumbles, but you can't hear a word he's mumbling. He communes with nature, but you do not sense anything meaningful happening.

934895,A2QHBFAXSYVDXK,B000AYEL10,"Anthony Del Vecchio ""College Student""","[4, 6]","I was nine in 1994 when Kurt Cobain died.  Nevermind was the first CD I ever owned and quickly became a fan when I became old enough to really appreciate music.  Ever since, I've gone through my music phases as most people do, but Nirvana is still the first and the last.Over this past winter, a friend of mine told me that he had seen 'Elephant' and that he really enjoyed it, as much as anyone can enjoy a movie with such frank subject matter; so I gave 'Elephant' a chance.  I watched it at 6:00 AM and was completely speechless.  The style of the movie was so beautiful and so original that the film haunted me for weeks.  So when I learned about Last Days, I could not wait to see it.I watched Last Days over this past weekend with my roommate, our friend, and his roommate.  Being the only one that had seen 'Elephant', I was the only one that really knew what to expect from Last Days.  However, at least three of us are Nirvana fans, so everyone else gave it a chance.From the beginning, there were grumblings.  ""The crackling of the fire is too loud"" (I kid you not, this was actually said), ""That scene was the most boring scene I've ever seen.  This movie has no plot.  There is no character development.  What's with the gay scene?"" and some other assorted gripes.  When it was over, here's where we stood:My Roommate: Liked it.My Friend and his Roommate: ""Worst movie ever""Me: Loved it.I was once again floored by Van Sant's vision.  The beauty of the shots and the melancholy mood kept me more than interested.  The scene that really stood out to me was the shot through the window where Blake plays every instrument, forming a one-man band.  The beauty of the slow track and the feeling of isolation in this scene could not be put into words.I am not going to discount the gripes of my friends, however whether you like a movie or not, its best not to talk during it; but that's just me.  The movie has no plot, this is true.  It has no dialogue, this is also true.  I would argue, however, that the character development was there, its just not spelled out for you.  With as little as Blake talked, we knew who he was, his relationships with his friends, and how he felt; his actions spoke louder than any monologue could have.Blake is alone in the world he lives in; he is lost himself in drugs and celebrity and has no idea who he is or who is friends are.  His friends are leeches.  Not really caring about Blake, only that he remains their meal ticket.  All interactions, albeit one-sided interactions, involve talks of money, jet heaters, and help on a song.The significance of Blake's lack of dialogue is the sense of irrelevance.  A man on the brink of eventual suicide, physically and mentally destroyed by drugs, is probably not going to say anything too profound, especially in the state of depression Blake was in throughout.  So why say anything at all?  We'd like to think that someone as tortured as he was would go out with a noble bang.  In reality, nobility would have no part and would go out in no more that a light whisper.This is NOT an Unofficial Biopic.  This is an Anti-Biopic.  All the sense of celebrity and greatness is stripped away and we see Blake in his most desperate days of his life: his last.  He is a man who has involuntarily lost himself amid the celebrity and hates his life because of it.  This is the essence of Last Days and Kurt Cobain himself.  Cobain often renounced his celebrity, which was a factor to his career-long depression.  I believe that this film stays true to this sentiment if Cobain approved any biopic, this or something similar would probably be it.This film will NOT be for everyone; this is an inescapable fact.  It is an experimental narrative.  Some will either be affected by this film or they won't.  You might like this if:a) You like Elephantb) You like Nirvanac) You can get lost in tracking shots and beautiful cinematography.If you are looking for a By-the-book Biopic, this film is not for you.  Not that there is anything wrong with you.

There's no dialogue for like the first 30min of the movies. Michael Pitt seemed like he was trying wayyy too hard to capture the ""spirit"" of Kurt. The pace of the movie is just way too slow to keep an active mind's attention. I fell asleep on it for the fourth time now. The movie feels like its trying too hard to convey the sadness and depression, Kurt may have felt in real life. I really think Kurt would laugh at this movie. There is significant proof that he did not commit suicide, for example, when his body was found, the shotgun was on his chest with the ejection port to the right of his body, the spent shell casing was on the left of his body, how is that possible? Also the pen that he wrote the supposed suicide note with has none of his fingerprints on it. Kurt was leaving Nirvana, if you dig deep enough, (im still finding new, info, music, the story really is very very deep and complex) you will find that out. In ""Been A Son"" (which is a much better movie, with Kurt acutally in it) he said he quit Nirvana at least 4 times in the months leading to his death. Michael Stipe said that most of Kurts music would have been quieter with lots of stringed instruments had he lived. From studying his music he seems very suicidal, especially ""In Utero"" but I think he was trying to scare his fanbase off. I used to think he commited suicide but after a lot of different info it seem he was either a victim of his wife, or the music industry (no further police investigations sounds like somebody paid somebody)or possibly both. They should have college courses on Kurt Cobain instead of Tupac Shakur at least Kurt was threatening violence on people.

So we have him depicted as Blake- a successful rock star who just wants to be left alone. He urinates in a stream, he eats noodles and he runs away whenever he sees someone at his door. His house is populated with hangers-on and drug-fiends, and just in case you didn't get that- the song Heroin by The Velvet Underground plays. Blake is depressed and cannot be bothered with life- but he has more costume changes than a Mariah Carey concert here. Remember Kurt in the red and black striped sweater? He wears it in the film. Remember him in the black dress? He wears it in the film. The hunting cap? Yep! He wears it here.This film is so incredibly tedious that it almost becomes offensive. It is as if the director has tried to mirror Kurt's obvious depression and boredom in the film-making. We even get a 30 second shot of a tree at one point- for no apparent reason. Let me get this out of the way- I am a huge Nirvana fan. I am a huge fan of movies. I prefer slow, thoughtful films over Hollywood blockbusters. All I ask from a director is that he move me in some way. Any way! Make me laugh a little. Make me cry. Make me gasp in awe just once at how beautifully framed a shot is. If the rest is substandard I can forgive them, as long as there is something to justify me having sat through their movie. Just do something within 93 minutes that I can take away with me. The main problem is this: There isn't a story here. Kurt Cobain's last few days: He ate, he shot up, he fell over and he shot himself. That is it. Don't offend me by trying to pass this off as something arty and thoughtful. It's easy to say that if someone doesn't like this film then they just didn't get it. It's their fault. They were expecting somthing more conventional like 'Ray' or 'Walk The Line'. No. Chances are that if you're gonna see this film then you're going to expect something different than your average biopic.I had heard going into that it was tedious, boring and pointless, but I was willing to give it a chance anyway. What you get is an hour and a half of pretensious waffle. There has been some criticisms aimed at this film that there is not enough dialogue. Wrong. There is too much. The man from the Yellow Pages? The hangers-on? Blake reading aloud his suicide note- just in case we didn't get the idea that that's what he was writing? It's all surplus. I could have congratulated a film where the camera lingered solely on the Blake character and showed us no-one else. I could have even accepted his Beavis and Butthead mumblings to himself. What I cannot accept is a film filled with bad dialogue, bad acting and such obvious references to the real life Kurt whilst staunchly denying that it is based on him. My wife turned to me ten minutes into the film. She said ""This is really tedious"". I told her to give it a chance. Not much long afterwards I was willing Blake to hurry up and blow his brains out.Truly one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune to have paid to watch. There is an interesting story about the life of Kurt Cobain that would make a half decent film if made by even the most cack-handed of directors. This isn't it. Why didn't Oliver Stone just make The Doors about the last days of Jim Morrison's life? Because it would have been boring. Instead he showed us the more interesting moments that peppered his short stay on this Earth. Personally, I think it would be a mistake to make a biopic about Kurt Cobain, but if it happens I can guarantee that it will make an infinitely more interesting film than this one.*Follow-up: Some months later:I am pleased to say that I managed to offload my copy of this and receive a whopping 2 for it. If you are still in any doubt about how bad this film is I urge you to check out the hilarious music video included on the dvd. Michael Pitt and his awful band parody Nirvana and spit pizza at the camera, whilst they mockingly ""play happy"" for the camera. Truly abysmal stuff. And after sitting through 5 minutes of the Michael Pitt interview I am now convinced that he was in fact playing himself in the movie- what an absolutely boring, aloof and idiotic man.",1,93 Minutes Of My Life That I Want Back,1254096000,"09 28, 2009",2009,4272,"['story', 'last', 'days', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'be', 'called', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'Courtney', 'might', 'sue', 'have', 'depicted', 'Blake-', 'successful', 'rock', 'star', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'stream', 'noodles', 'away', 'whenever', 'someone', 'door', 'house', 'populated', 'hangers-on', 'drug-fiends', 'just', 'case', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'that-', 'song', 'Heroin', 'Velvet', 'Underground', 'Blake', 'depressed', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'bothered', 'life-', 'more', 'costume', 'changes', 'Mariah', 'Carey', 'concert', 'here', 'Remember', 'Kurt', 'red', 'black', 'striped', 'sweater', 'film', 'Remember', 'black', 'dress', 'film', 'hunting', 'cap', 'Yep', 'here.This', 'film', 'so', 'incredibly', 'tedious', 'almost', 'offensive', 'director', 'tried', 'mirror', 'Kurt', 'obvious', 'depression', 'boredom', 'film-making', 'even', 'get', '30', 'second', 'shot', 'tree', 'one', 'point-', 'apparent', 'reason', 'Let', 'get', 'out', 'way-', 'am', 'huge', 'Nirvana', 'fan', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'movies', 'prefer', 'slow', 'thoughtful', 'films', 'Hollywood', 'blockbusters', 'ask', 'director', 'move', 'way', 'way', 'Make', 'little', 'Make', 'cry', 'Make', 'gasp', 'awe', 'just', 'once', 'how', 'beautifully', 'framed', 'shot', 'rest', 'substandard', 'can', 'forgive', 'as', 'long', 'something', 'justify', 'having', 'sat', 'movie', 'Just', 'do', 'something', '93', 'minutes', 'can', 'take', 'away', 'main', 'problem', ""n't"", 'story', 'here', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'last', 'few', 'days', 'ate', 'shot', 'up', 'fell', 'over', 'shot', 'Do', ""n't"", 'offend', 'trying', 'pass', 'off', 'something', 'arty', 'thoughtful', 'easy', 'say', 'someone', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'then', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'fault', 'were', 'expecting', 'somthing', 'more', 'conventional', ""'Ray"", ""'Walk"", 'Line', 'No', 'Chances', 'are', ""'re"", 'gon', 'see', 'film', 'then', ""'re"", 'going', 'expect', 'something', 'different', 'average', 'biopic.I', 'had', 'heard', 'going', 'was', 'tedious', 'boring', 'pointless', 'was', 'willing', 'give', 'chance', 'anyway', 'What', 'get', 'hour', 'half', 'pretensious', 'waffle', 'been', 'criticisms', 'aimed', 'film', 'not', 'enough', 'dialogue', 'Wrong', 'too', 'much', 'man', 'Yellow', 'Pages', 'hangers-on', 'Blake', 'reading', 'suicide', 'note-', 'just', 'case', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'writing', 'surplus', 'could', 'have', 'congratulated', 'film', 'where', 'camera', 'lingered', 'solely', 'Blake', 'character', 'showed', 'no-one', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'even', 'accepted', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'mumblings', 'What', 'can', 'not', 'accept', 'film', 'filled', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'bad', 'acting', 'such', 'obvious', 'references', 'real', 'life', 'Kurt', 'staunchly', 'denying', 'based', 'wife', 'turned', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'said', 'really', 'tedious', 'told', 'give', 'chance', 'Not', 'much', 'afterwards', 'was', 'willing', 'Blake', 'hurry', 'up', 'blow', 'brains', 'out.Truly', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'misfortune', 'have', 'paid', 'watch', 'interesting', 'story', 'life', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'would', 'make', 'half', 'decent', 'film', 'made', 'even', 'most', 'cack-handed', 'directors', ""n't"", 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'just', 'make', 'Doors', 'last', 'days', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'boring', 'Instead', 'showed', 'more', 'interesting', 'moments', 'peppered', 'short', 'stay', 'Earth', 'Personally', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'mistake', 'make', 'biopic', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'can', 'guarantee', 'will', 'make', 'infinitely', 'more', 'interesting', 'film', 'one', '*Follow-up', 'months', 'later', 'am', 'pleased', 'say', 'managed', 'offload', 'copy', 'receive', 'whopping', '2', 'are', 'still', 'doubt', 'how', 'bad', 'film', 'urge', 'check', 'out', 'hilarious', 'music', 'video', 'included', 'dvd', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'awful', 'band', 'parody', 'Nirvana', 'spit', 'pizza', 'camera', 'whilst', 'mockingly', 'play', 'happy', 'camera', 'Truly', 'abysmal', 'stuff', 'sitting', '5', 'minutes', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'interview', 'am', 'now', 'convinced', 'was', 'fact', 'playing', 'movie-', 'what', 'absolutely', 'boring', 'aloof', 'idiotic', 'man']",Gus Van Sant's Last Days

It is maddeningly slow, not only on the (non-existent) dialog, but even the Cobain wannabe is slow.  Seriously, I literally played this movie at 2x SPEED and he LITERALLY took close to 20 or 30 seconds to bend his knees and crawl on the floor (can't imagine that in real time)!  And the characters don't even speak up, you'll literally have to turn your TV set all the way up and put closed captioned to know what they're saying.Is Van Sant's intention to portray heroin addiction as a horrid experience that destroys the soul?  Did he want to portray how stardom got to Cobain and messed with him?  I pretty much doubt any of that, I did not feel the slightest shred of sympathy at any time during the movie.  It doesn't go anywhere, this movie is torture at its worst.  The good reviews are based mostly on its experimental nature, the (I don't know where they found it) character development, and the pain (what pain???? the movie doesn't express anything palpable!) Cobain felt those final days.  Every single person in the movie is boring.The so-called professional critics seems to have somewhat favored this movie and it just escapes me.  Is being artsy fartsy good?  Is showing prominently on camera *just* a TV set playing around a minute or two of a video from Boyz II Men experimental and therefore good? Does it advance the story in any way?  Is that pure genius?  He does have guts though, it takes a lot of them to film that and call it a movie.Van Sant, here's an experiment for you: go out to the streets, film real life junkies, heroin addicts and transmit their pain to the audience.  Seek out people with suicidal tendencies and find the root of their suffering.  Thirty minutes of that, even if it doesn't have single syllable of dialog, just the look of sadness in their faces will do a whole lot more than this garbage of a film you created and thrust upon us!

934905,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B000AYEL10,Douglas King,"[1, 2]","Gus Van Sant is a difficult and unpredictable director. He can pull off a quirky dramatic masterpiece like ""My Own Private Idaho"", or a hilarious, deranged satire like ""Die To For"" with equal aplomb. With ""Elephant"", he created an ingeniously naturalistic style that made the Columbine-like climax to the film even more powerful. Sadly, that same naturalistic style does not work nearly as well in ""Last Days"". By depicting a series of tedious, excruciating moments leading up to the suicide of rock star ""Blake"" (Kurt Cobain), the film does do a good job of showing the mental state of someone who has clearly given up on life and detached themselves from their surroundings. However, it's not particularly engrossing for the viewer to watch. Michael Pitt inhabits the character beautifully, with his sad eyes, mumbling speech, and defiant laziness. It's just that he never really gets the chance to do much that's interesting, other than wear a woman's nightgown or a pair of spacey sunglasses. The most beautiful scene in the film is when Blake's ghost slips out of his corpse and climbs an invisible ladder into the next life.

934906,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000AYEL10,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[3, 4]","Kurt Cobain was that all-too-familiar spectacle of rock'n'roll -- a young genius who is ruined by his own success and inner demons, and ends up dying too early.And while Gus Van Sant never openly admits that the protagonist of ""Last Days"" is Cobain, it's pretty obvious to anyone with five active brain cells that this is a story about his last days. Unfortunately it's hardly a fitting eulogy to such a vibrant personality -- instead it's a slow grind of excruciatingly dull, unspeakably mundane events. By the time the gun comes into play, the viewers will already be dead of boredom.We first see Blake (Michael Pitt) staggering through the countryside near his New York mansion, muttering to himself and apparently not paying any attention to his surroundings. Upon returning home he makes cereal, staggers around in a dress, and starts zoning out when the Yellow Pages man comes to call on business. He also passes out in an empty room in front of the TV.If I wanted to see this, I'd go hang out at a frat house on Sunday morning.The vast, chilly mansion is filled with various drugged-out hangers-on who have sex, go on joyrides and sponge off Blake, although he seems too far gone to really care. And though Blake makes a few clumsy attempts at reaching out, the others see him just as a source of money and shelter. And by the time his mother arrives to try to reason with him, it's clear that Blake has reached the point of no return.... and only tragedy will follow.Rather than making a straightforward biopic of a thinly-veiled Cobain, Gus Van Sant evidently decided to focus on the last few days before Cobain took his own life in a Seattle greenhouse. This could have been a shocking, haunting experience -- a look into the final hours of a man of wild genius as he started circling the drain. It could have been a look into a modern American tragedy.Instead we get a film that Van Sant clearly directed while fast asleep. Which is more or less what I wanted to do as I watched ""Blake"" going about the most mundane tasks imaginable.Admittedly the settings are lovely -- fresh green woods and lawns, and a rambling stone mansion filled with shabby furniture. But nothing really HAPPENS in this movie, except a long treacly string of excruciatingly slow events that have nothing to do with one another. Van Sant spins it out in hyper-realistic style, with no music, mumbled dialogue and lots of boring activities observed in detail -- and frankly nothing could be more dull.And though a few scenes have a feeling of imminent doom -- such as Blake's fruitless trip to a local punk club, or his pitiful attempts at playing music -- most of ""Last Days"" lacks even the slightest shred of foreboding or foreshadowing. Blake just does a lot of random, empty activities around his house, such as a seemingly ten-minute scene about making macaroni and cheese. No foreboding. And when he reaches the inevitable end, that's it.Michael Pitt is one of the few good things about this movie. Though Van Sant blatantly wastes his screen presence for most of the movie, his beautiful face and powerful eyes fill the screen during the more emotional scenes, such as Blake's final meeting with his mother. Though the camera rarely captures it -- Van Sant seems more interested in watching him stumble around -- he gives a startlingly, disturbingly good performance when given half a chance.Most of the other actors, though, are no more than hostile cardboard cutouts, and there's nobody here who has much presence -- which may be appropriate, since they're all leeches.

934907,A35AMPDFAB8JLT,B000AYEL10,Edmonson,"[0, 0]","""Last Days"" (2005)  is directed by Gus Van Sant (Good Will Hunting, Drugstore Cowboy). This film portrays the fictionalized account of the final days of Curt Cobain's life. Curt Cobain (Blake) is portrayed by Michael Pitt as an introspective musician who is in isolation, constantly evading those around him, and stumbling about from a drug overdose. The film doesn't seem like much at first, and I wondered if the character would have any interest if I didn't know that this was about Curt Cobain's last days alive, but gradually these random, uninteresting events that we are shown are pulled together to reveal a mood and atmosphere that becomes hypnotic. An eight minute long dolly shot pulls back from a window of the house where Curt Cobain is practicing his music as a rising crescendo of haunting music collides with Curt's bashing of the drums. The sonic aspect of this scene is somewhat reminiscent of the cacophony of sound heard in Apocalypse Now when the madness is portrayed in the heart of darkness. This and other images, such as those of the towering green rain forest surrounding the old stone house, and the poetic scene of Curt's last breath, make this film a memorable experience.The two dvd set comes with a full screen and widescreen version of the movie, and there are a number of special features, including a making of the film, a deleted scene, a music video and the filming of the long dolly shot.",3,Slow build to a crescendo ...,1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,1425,"['Last', 'Days', '2005', 'directed', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Drugstore', 'Cowboy', 'film', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'final', 'days', 'Curt', 'Cobain', 'life', 'Curt', 'Cobain', 'Blake', 'portrayed', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'introspective', 'musician', 'who', 'isolation', 'constantly', 'evading', 'stumbling', 'about', 'drug', 'overdose', 'film', ""n't"", 'seem', 'much', 'first', 'wondered', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'interest', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'Curt', 'Cobain', 'last', 'days', 'alive', 'gradually', 'random', 'uninteresting', 'events', 'are', 'shown', 'are', 'pulled', 'together', 'reveal', 'mood', 'atmosphere', 'hypnotic', 'eight', 'minute', 'long', 'dolly', 'shot', 'pulls', 'back', 'window', 'house', 'where', 'Curt', 'Cobain', 'practicing', 'music', 'rising', 'crescendo', 'haunting', 'music', 'collides', 'Curt', 'bashing', 'drums', 'sonic', 'aspect', 'scene', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'cacophony', 'sound', 'heard', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'when', 'madness', 'portrayed', 'heart', 'darkness', 'other', 'images', 'such', 'towering', 'green', 'rain', 'forest', 'surrounding', 'old', 'stone', 'house', 'poetic', 'scene', 'Curt', 'last', 'breath', 'make', 'film', 'memorable', 'experience.The', 'two', 'dvd', 'set', 'full', 'screen', 'widescreen', 'version', 'movie', 'are', 'number', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'making', 'film', 'deleted', 'scene', 'music', 'video', 'filming', 'long', 'dolly', 'shot']",Gus Van Sant's Last Days

The film's main character, Blake, a thinly-veiled interpretation of Kurt Cobain in his last days, doesn't do much of anything for the entire 96 minute running time.  He mumbles imcomprehensibly at least 90% of the time, and the supporting cast might as well not say anything at all, because the viewer hasn't a clue what they're talking about.  The film is drab, boring, and painful to sit through.But so is addiction.  So is living a life completely devoid of joy and connection with other human beings.  So is feeling completely isolated from any human contact.  So is dying from the inside out.  In portraying these states, this film has a lot to say.If you've already seen the film and are wondering why you don't understand Blake, don't worry.  You're not meant to.  The brilliance of this film is that it refuses to explain or justify a life of addiction, but rather shows you what it's really like.  It's misery.  It's isolation.  It's entrapment, both in the mental and physical sense.  And, in every way, it's mind-numbing.Whether you've seen this film or are planning to, it's important that you know what you're getting yourself into.  If you're looking for entertainment or any sort of Kurt Cobain biopic, you're wasting your time.  However, if you want to gain some insight into the life and death of an addict, sans all Hollywood distortions or glorifications, you've found the perfect film.  This film is honest, and honesty is not often entertaining.

In fact, I found myself actively disliking, even loathing the characters (all of them).  When the end came, I just didn't care anymore.  If this were really what Cobain became like, then his death wasn't a tragedy.

What's not obvious is how badly this movie views. While I'm all for creative art films and I've liked many that most find obnoxious or outright boring, I can't stand movies that forget that we're supposed to be entertained. What director Gus Van Sant (""Elephant"", ""Good Will Hunting"", ""Drugstore Cowboy"") does well is attach the state of loneliness, depression, anxiety, and societal indifference that Kurt must have been going through in his last moments. And certainly that would make this movie special-if it hadn't been dragged out for the entire movie. There's a lack of anything really going on. We watch as he swims in a stream in the opening, then makes a campfire, and then in the morning wanders back to his big house. And just as isolated as he indeed is after his escape from the detoxification center so is the audience. You sit there aimlessly watching a main character be aimless, knowing and anticipating the conclusion, but bored in the wait. Perhaps that's the irony isn't it?

934916,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B000AYEL10,Kevin Killian,"[3, 7]","After watching the gay romantic comedy LATTER DAYS I became intrigued about the Mormon missionaries and googled up this film, with its similar title it might almost be a sequel to LATTER DAYS.  In LAST DAYS, the Mormon elders played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Steve Sandvoss in the first film are here replaced by a cute pair of twins, played by Adam and Andy Friberg.  They really bring a lot of conviction to the part, and although the residents of the castle don't respond immediately to their sales talk, they never seem unduly upset.  I expect the Mormon pairs who come up to people's doors on their evangelical mission must get a lot of turndowns, but I wonder if it's common for the Church officials to assign two brothers (especially twins) the same Mission?  Maybe this is Van Sant's way of saying something about mirroring, the way he was attracted to re-telling the classic Hitchcock film PSYCHO because of its underplot of two sisters, Marion and Vera Crane, with very different personalities, each vying for the same man (Viggo's character) while having to fend off Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates.  Anyway this mirroring or ""twin"" aspect of Van Sant's films has long been a commonplace in the critical response to his work.  What I liked about LAST DAYS which, I must admit, was a little disappointing if only because the Mormon content was ultimately only a tiny fraction of what seems like an interminable film, is that, even when the Friberg boys say goodbye, their aura remains throughout the remainder of the project.In one sequence a stoned Michael Pitt, wearing a black slip and looking super hot and girlish, freezes up and then collapses in extremely slow motion.  His muscles must still ache having to descend on bent knees at the pace of a snail, it's a feat even Martha Graham in 1934 might have found difficult, and yet it is a moment of real beauty, reminiscent of the famous sequence in Hitchcock's TOPAZ when Juanita de Cordoba (Karin Dor) is shot by John Vernon in the chest and from the ceiling the camera watches her collapse in her red dress, so that the gown seems to be spreading, like a pool of blood, on the marble floors so that the gown seems to be shedding petals like a flower.  It certainly seems as though Blake is dying in this sequence but no, a minute later you see him up and about, carrying a shotgun around, no longer wearing a slip, and in general acting super paranoid.  I thought he was going to pull a Columbine, but at heart something of the Mormon message must have taken hold on poor Blake.Many have commented on the significance of his name, ""Blake,"" and its echo of the English romantic artist, poet and visionary of the early 19th century.  Like William Blake, LAST DAYS' Kurt Cobain-like singer-songwriter finds spiritual depth in the slightest interaction of man and nature.  He has a deep, perhaps psychotic understanding of the brevity of time and the insustainability of life.  As William Blake wrote,O rose, thou art sick!The invisible wormThat flies in the night,In the howling storm,Has found out thy bedOf crimson joy,And his dark secret loveDoes thy life destroy.The song that Michael Pitt (Blake) composes, ""From Death to Birth"" reverses this sentiment but uses its same general framework.  We remember that Joseph Smith (b 1805) was born in the middle of a great romantic revival not only in this country but abroad, and that the Book of Mormon, ""given to him"" before he was 25 years old, is in some ways the work of a man younger even than Kurt Cobain himself.

""Drugstore Cowboy"" is a movie I fell in love when I saw it in the theater, it still has a place in my heart.  ""My Own Private Idaho"", while deeply flawed, was so ambitious.  And ""To Die For"" is a sublime, sly comedy.I think it's fair to say that Van Sant has been on a minimalist streak in recent years:  minimal dialogue, minimal plot, minimal action, minimal narrative drive.  His last three pictures were characterized by all this and filmed in loooong, stagnant shots.  There was ""Gerry"", then ""Elephant"" and now ""Last Days"".I will never criticize a filmmaker for working outside the mainstream and for developing a unique visual perspective.  But it is easy for me to see why so many people hate these movies!  But it's also easy for me to see why some people hold them in such high regard.  And I won't say either group is wrong.  With these films, it is largely a matter of taste.  ""Gerry"", to me, was a crashing bore and an utter failure.  ""Elephant"", I'm surprised to say, was a movie I found tremendous.  And ""Last Days""?  I guess I'd split the difference.  While it didn't have the emotional resonance of ""Elephant"", it wasn't nearly as tedious as ""Gerry"".But I wouldn't necessarily recommend any of these films to the ""average"" movie goer.  To most mainstream audiences--""different"" is not a good thing.  That's why Van Sant's ""Good Will Hunting"" is his most popular work--it's a genial crowd pleaser.  Only seek out ""Last Days"" if you know what you're getting into--and don't come to get any insight into Kurt Cobain (it's not a biography).Michael Pitt is a talented young actor, and I admire his work here.  Yet he is also a dynamic performer--and that's what you'll miss.  Catch him in ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"", ""The Dreamers"", and ""Bully"".  This guy wants to be an actor, not a star--and I suppose, in some ways, that made him a good choice for ""Last Days"".Some say Van Sant's last three pictures have been self-indulgent.  Maybe so, but maybe that's not always a bad thing.

934918,AOJMNCH3E2FQO,B000AYEL10,"K. Wilson ""Tapehead and Avid Reader""","[3, 5]","Every decade has a transitional period, the time before that pivotal moment that defines the new decade and distinguishes it from the last. American pop music in the early 90's was no exception. It languished in the stale, formulaic offerings of the 80's until one song changed everything.Nirvana's 1991 single ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" marked the birth of a new era in popular music. Soon after the song's video hit the airwaves, the dominant genres of glam rock and dance pop gave way to the ascendance of ""grunge."" As Nirvana's frontman, Kurt Cobain was dragged along for the ride.Cobain, a reluctant celebrity in life, was elevated to icon status upon his death. Gus Van Sant's Last Days is a fictionalized account of the days preceding Cobain's apparent suicide in 1994. The most surprising thing about this film is that it took ten years to materialize. Despite the specter of litigation from Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, the near absence of films about Cobain is surprising.Last Days marks the third and final installment of what director Van Sant refers to as his ""death trilogy,"" consisting of three interpretations of man's isolation. In Gerry, two men are physically isolated when lost in the desert, while Elephant documents a tragedy resulting from the social isolation of two teenagers. Last Days attempts to convey the loneliness and despair of a rock star whose superficial social status masks his growing mental isolation.Van Sant's minimalist approach strips away most of the elements of a conventional story. Dialogue and a linear plot structure are sacrificed in an attempt to achieve an emotional purity. This technique has worked with varying levels of success in the previous films but ultimately fails in Last Days.The film follows Blake (Michael Pitt), a rock musician, as he leaves rehab and meanders to his crumbling mansion, a perfect setting for his disintegration. It soon becomes apparent that many people are trying to track Blake down. A series of encounters and phone calls illustrate his disillusionment from his ""friends,"" many of whom seem only interested in convincing Blake to do things for their benefit.Oblivious to his torment, his roommates ignore the signs that something is terribly wrong. Their indifference is best demonstrated in the scene where Asia (Asia Argento) finds Blake collapsed on the floor clutching a rifle. She simply props him back up and tells no one about what she has seen. In another pivotal scene, Luke (Lukas Haas) sees a mysterious figure in the greenhouse but simply drives away without investigating. This foreshadowing is an illusion to the theory that Cobain was murdered, as the figure is clearly not Blake.The kindest way to describe the pace of Last Days might be languid but truthfully the word monotonous might be more appropriate. Perhaps this was a deliberate move by Van Sant to communicate the ennui of Blake's real life versus the usual perception that rock stars live more exciting lives than regular people.Ultimately, the outwardly banal dialogue of Elephant was effective in gradually exposing many of the petty injustices and cruelties of high school. Elephant's use of that commonality of experience with the viewer helped to make its characters real and sympathetic. In contrast, the incomprehensible mumblings of Blake in Last Days are less than illuminating. Where we should feel sympathy for Blake we gradually become disinterested and impatient for something to happen.The sole redeeming quality of Last Days is its masterful use of experimental cinematography. The lenghy abstracted shots convey a sense of easedropping on the participants. The gloomy interior scenes produces a palpable sense of depression and doom. Unfortunatley, while great technique will usually enhance a movie, it isn't enough to make up for Last Days other flaws.",3,Great technique can't save a flawed story,1150243200,"06 14, 2006",2006,3835,"['decade', 'transitional', 'period', 'time', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'new', 'decade', 'distinguishes', 'last', 'American', 'pop', 'music', 'early', '90', 'was', 'exception', 'languished', 'stale', 'formulaic', 'offerings', '80', 'one', 'song', 'changed', 'everything.Nirvana', '1991', 'single', 'Smells', 'Teen', 'Spirit', 'marked', 'birth', 'new', 'era', 'popular', 'music', 'Soon', 'song', 'video', 'hit', 'airwaves', 'dominant', 'genres', 'glam', 'rock', 'dance', 'pop', 'gave', 'way', 'ascendance', 'grunge', 'Nirvana', 'frontman', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'was', 'dragged', 'ride.Cobain', 'reluctant', 'celebrity', 'life', 'was', 'elevated', 'icon', 'status', 'death', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'Last', 'Days', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'days', 'preceding', 'Cobain', 'apparent', 'suicide', '1994', 'most', 'surprising', 'thing', 'film', 'took', 'ten', 'years', 'materialize', 'specter', 'litigation', 'Cobain', 'widow', 'Courtney', 'Love', 'near', 'absence', 'films', 'Cobain', 'surprising.Last', 'Days', 'third', 'final', 'installment', 'what', 'director', 'Van', 'Sant', 'refers', 'death', 'trilogy', 'consisting', 'three', 'interpretations', 'man', 'isolation', 'Gerry', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'physically', 'isolated', 'when', 'lost', 'desert', 'Elephant', 'documents', 'tragedy', 'resulting', 'social', 'isolation', 'two', 'teenagers', 'Last', 'Days', 'attempts', 'convey', 'loneliness', 'despair', 'rock', 'star', 'superficial', 'social', 'status', 'masks', 'growing', 'mental', 'isolation.Van', 'Sant', 'minimalist', 'approach', 'away', 'most', 'elements', 'conventional', 'story', 'Dialogue', 'linear', 'plot', 'structure', 'are', 'sacrificed', 'attempt', 'achieve', 'emotional', 'purity', 'technique', 'worked', 'varying', 'levels', 'success', 'previous', 'films', 'ultimately', 'Last', 'Days.The', 'film', 'Blake', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'rock', 'musician', 'rehab', 'meanders', 'crumbling', 'mansion', 'perfect', 'setting', 'disintegration', 'soon', 'apparent', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'trying', 'track', 'Blake', 'down', 'series', 'encounters', 'phone', 'calls', 'illustrate', 'disillusionment', 'friends', 'many', 'whom', 'seem', 'only', 'interested', 'convincing', 'Blake', 'do', 'things', 'benefit.Oblivious', 'torment', 'roommates', 'ignore', 'signs', 'something', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'indifference', 'best', 'demonstrated', 'scene', 'where', 'Asia', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'Blake', 'collapsed', 'floor', 'clutching', 'rifle', 'simply', 'props', 'back', 'up', 'one', 'what', 'seen', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'Luke', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'mysterious', 'figure', 'greenhouse', 'simply', 'away', 'investigating', 'foreshadowing', 'illusion', 'theory', 'Cobain', 'was', 'murdered', 'figure', 'clearly', 'not', 'Blake.The', 'kindest', 'way', 'describe', 'pace', 'Last', 'Days', 'might', 'be', 'languid', 'truthfully', 'word', 'monotonous', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'appropriate', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'deliberate', 'move', 'Van', 'Sant', 'communicate', 'ennui', 'Blake', 'real', 'life', 'usual', 'perception', 'rock', 'stars', 'live', 'more', 'exciting', 'lives', 'regular', 'people.Ultimately', 'outwardly', 'banal', 'dialogue', 'Elephant', 'was', 'effective', 'gradually', 'exposing', 'many', 'petty', 'injustices', 'cruelties', 'high', 'school', 'Elephant', 'use', 'commonality', 'experience', 'viewer', 'helped', 'make', 'characters', 'real', 'sympathetic', 'contrast', 'incomprehensible', 'mumblings', 'Blake', 'Last', 'Days', 'are', 'less', 'illuminating', 'Where', 'should', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'Blake', 'gradually', 'become', 'disinterested', 'impatient', 'something', 'happen.The', 'sole', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'Last', 'Days', 'masterful', 'use', 'experimental', 'cinematography', 'lenghy', 'abstracted', 'shots', 'convey', 'sense', 'easedropping', 'participants', 'gloomy', 'interior', 'scenes', 'palpable', 'sense', 'depression', 'doom', 'Unfortunatley', 'great', 'technique', 'will', 'usually', 'enhance', 'movie', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'up', 'Last', 'Days', 'other', 'flaws']",Gus Van Sant's Last Days

Van Sant's take on Kurt Cobain's psyche is steeped in anomie, loneliness, and the deep sadness that infuses your being when you have given up, almost completely, on relating to others for any reason at all. Blake (read: Cobain), played by Michael Pitt, is a rock icon who lives in a huge mansion funded by his astounding success but who has by this time become completely mired in his own lack of interest in practically anything at all except, occasionally, making music.But even that is an activity he has just about forsaken. The one time we see him composing a piece, it's from a distance and from outside looking in (he's in one of the many many rooms in his mansion doing this), as though he himself is an outsider to his own activity. This is an intelligent film, really well thought out, with a standout performance by Michael Pitt who, when he does say anything at all, is mostly unintelligible, mumbling, hiding behind ridiculous sunglasses, and endlessly roaming about the enormous grounds surrounding his mansion.This is not at all a linear film but one whose substance gels, slowly, ever so slowly, very very slowly, based on Blake's psyche and, sometimes, those of his ""friends"" and hangers-on and also occasional interlopers (a Yellow Pages salesman, two religious missionary nut types), all of which adds up to a richly conceived character-based piece that gives you, more than anything else, the sense that time has slowed down, more than it ever could in any other way, in any other film until finally at the end, time stops for Blake forever.Completely unique, completely unlike any other film from 2005, or, for that matter, a whole lot of other years, Last Days deserves to be seen at least once so that you can feel it, and then one more time so that you can sink into it and really feel it.Unforgettable.

934921,A1D2AXVN20OQZD,B000AYEL10,Marc A. Coignard,"[17, 25]","I found Last Days to be a far better film than most critics and audiences seem to have found it.  Not only was it watchable, despite being very slow, it was at times very funny and it was certainly a wonderful alternative to the cliche world of Rock and Roll bio-pickes.  Van Sant doesn't for one second try to explain or over-indulge the audience with a sorrowful tale of one man's inability to cope with this fame.  This is refreshing to me.  Van Sant doesn't give us a cookie-cutter mold of what a film about a popular icon is supposed to be, so I was not sure what to expect, which helped me enjoy this film.  Many are put off by the mumbling and incoherent rants of the lead character Blake played by Michael Pitt, but I found them to be funny, especially when he's attempting to communicate with a Yellow Book salesman who has him confused with a business owner.  Its a slice of life-before-death film, and fans of Cobain should be warned about what NOT to expect.  This is not a biopic, nor was it ever intended to be one.  If anything, Van Sant is simply guessing what he belives it must have been like for the last day(s) of a man who has decided to kill himself.  Visually the film was stunning, and Van Sant seems to be an expert at using the silence between people in order to emphasise natural noises, which gave me a nice sense of calm in watching the film, another reason why the movie was easy to watch.  It was never hurried, and its shooting perfectly matched the script's and character's pacing.I find it very strange that so many people called Gus Van Sant's previous film Elephant a masterpiece and this one is being called a terrible film.  They are shot the exact same way, and the tone and mood of both films are VERY similar.  I thought Elephant's subject matter (a school shooting) wasn't appropriate for this style of film making where the audience is put down in a spot to merely observe events happening.  Last Days, on the other hand, is more fitting.  No matter how tragic Cobain's death was, I find it hard to compare the suicide of a rock star to the murder of several innocent school kids.  If anything, Last Days gives us more to watch, as we actually have a character worth paying some attention to.  True, Blake doesn't do much at all, but when he is spoken to by people, or when he's got a hunting cap on and creeping around his house with a rifle as if he was a hunter stalking prey, its easier  to watch than a bunch of kids walking around for an hour, then have two other kids shoot them for half an our, which, basically, is what happened in Elephant.  The character in Last Days may not be too in-depth, but at least there is a character worth caring about.A film like this also shows the importance of reading reviews before viewing.  Most people get the film thinking, ""Oh, its about Kurt Cobain.  I like Nirvana, so I'll like this movie"" without bothering to find out what makes this film so significant.

Having no experience with ""Grunge"" music (of which there were examples in the film), I didn't know what Cobain's influence was, nor his popularity among the devotees of that particular style of music.""Last Days"" is the sad final goodbye of this enigmatic young man. It is doubly sad that he used drugs to blunt the depression he felt at how his life was ""progressing"" at that point.Gus Van Sant's treatment of the film is reminiscent of ""Elephant"". Little dialog, and long shots, maybe too long, to tell a story. After his disastrous attempt at remaking ""Psycho"", it comes as no surprise he would change (permanently?) his cinematic style. Personally, I like the way he's doing things now. ""Last Days"" came across somewhat atmospheric and surreal.I found the visits by the two men spreading their religion and the advertising salesman very funny. They dove ahead, oblivious to the indifference that was staring them in the face. Conversely, Blake's (Michael Pitt) absolute abhorrence for doing anything to further his career just underscores his drive to do what ultimately killed him. Very sad.All the performances were very good, and I happen to be a fan of Michael Pitt. This young man has come a long way in a very short time. I look forward to any film he happens to be in, just to see how he stretches himself. That his dialog consisted of nothing more than mumbling, is in itself a feat. Try doing that for an hour or two.

I often come across reviews where people complain that a movie was so bad they wasted 2 hours of their life they will never get back. I rarely feel that way. Watching ""Last Days"", I did.The movie is very tedious to watch. There's no plot to speak of. It consists of endless scenes of lead character, Blake, walking round mumbling to himself, and occasional scenes of pointless dialogue. Some reviewers have defended the lack of plot by saying the movie is a character study. But ""Last Days"" fails as a character study because it never lets us to get to know Blake. And a character study, too, needs something to keep the viewer interested.""Last Days"" was truly a waste of 93 minutes of my life that I will never get back. I have no idea how Gus Van Sant, who made ""My Own Private Idaho"", could make such a bad movie. Perhaps the movie is meant to be boring. Perhaps it's the point of the movie. Maybe Van Sant wants to make the audience as bored and frustrated as Blake is. If that is what Van Sant intended, the movie succeeds.

934929,A2B8G7W3JXKMZA,B000AYEL10,"Randolph Bradley ""RBJ""","[0, 2]","From reading reviews of this movie, I expected it to be just awful . . . but it's not.  It's an interesting case study of one of rock's great personalities and innovators.  Obviously, those expecting to be entertained are not, and those expecting ""insight"" at least will get that.  As hard as it may be for some to accept, Grunge is nothing more than the way it looks and sounds.  Although, Cobain's greatness is debatable, his legacy will outlast debate, as his music and style defined American youth angst for the 80s-90s.  There always has been youthful angst, and there always will be, it's just that Nirvana excelled at defining its generation.Gus Van Sant seems to have lost a few fans along the way to Last Days, who feel that he is out-of-touch when, in fact, Last Days is done in proper Van Sant form (Indie) and defines Cobain and Grunge perfectly.  Maybe all that inner anger takes its toll more deeply than before imagined, and its effect will be felt in multiple ways reflected in youth defined that way.  I admire Van Sant for making movies he wants to make.  Even his great successes had little regard for what the public may want.  For this alone, true fans should stick with him and, at the least, try to understand his motives.  Van Sant lately has fixated on case studies of troubled young white males, who it seems America has forgotten (in a sense).  For better or worse, being a young white male in America has no special meaning.Last Days is an emotional piece and we are taken into the nearly vacuous mind of Blake/Kurt, in his final hours, who doesn't have much left to live for.  Too much too soon, maybe?  It seems that his creativity coincided with economic necessity.  After success, where to then?  Moreover, he must have had some very serious emotional conflicts.Atmosphere is very key in this film.  The photography is well done in the sense that it adequately compensates for lack of dialogue.  Isolation and despondency are made clear by the vistas, fields, verdant greenery, and one man being out there alone.  It is helpful to know that the film begins with Blake/Kurt having escaped from a drug clinic spending the first night in the woods near his country estate.  Van Sant's use of the Boys II Men video, ""On Bended Knee,"" serves to emphasize (possibly) one's realization at the end of  all hope.  The lyrics in this song are of a man who wants to ""go back to the way that things used to be.""  And he is begging and praying for that possibility.

934931,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000AYEL10,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 1]","A Homeric nod from the great Gus Van Sant.Just as he made a movie about Columbine (""Elephant"") that wasn't specifically about Columbine, Van Sant has made a film about Kurt Cobain that isn't specifically about Cobain.  Blake is a suicidal rock star who skips out on his detox program and heads to a house in the woods where his fellow musician buddies have taken up residence.  There he whiles away the time till he finds it in himself to take that inevitable step of crossing over into the great beyond.Let me just state right up front that I believe Van Sant to be one of the most brilliant and innovative of modern filmmakers, and that at least one of his films (the aforementioned ""Elephant"") is one of the truly great films of the 21st Century so far.  But ""Last Days"" looks as if it were tossed off by the moviemaker and a few of his friends during a boring weekend in the Poconos (the film is actually set in Seattle to better gibe with the Cobain storyline).  Van Sant's style, which seems to be becoming increasingly idiosyncratic with each film he makes, has here become so internalized and off-putting that he winds up completely alienating even the most tolerant and forgiving member of his admittedly small core audience.  The movie basically consists of Blake shuffling around the house muttering and mumbling to himself, sometimes wearing a slip and sometimes toting a large rifle, while various irrelevant people from the outside world - a telephone book adman, a couple of Mormon missionaries - stop by for a visit.  With no plot, characterization or conflict to speak of, the film simply evaporates into the ether, leaving us to wonder just why Van Sant felt compelled to make it, and why we should feel any compunction to watch it.  Empty of ideas but filled with self-importance, ""Last Days"" is, without a doubt, Van Sant's least impressive work to date and an ""art film"" in the worst sense of the term.

934932,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000AYEL10,Samuel McKewon,"[2, 5]","Once I felt the emptiness of the lead character in Gus Van Sant's ""Last Days."" It was at the end of a 31-hour drive from California to Nebraska on New Year's Day when I nudged my friend and pointed out into the blowing snow.""Look at that giant dump truck, man. Just look at it. Look at it."" It was five in the morning. When I later stumbled into my dorm room I wanted to cry, but instead I kneeled right there on the floor and leaned on the TV to sleep.We never learn why Blake the alternative rock star inhabits this state as a daily routine in ""Last Days."" Because actor Michael Pitt looks and dresses like Kurt Cobain, shambling about in his Upstate New York castle, muttering under his breath, we are to borrow the reasons Cobain claimed for his exhaustion and use them here. It'd be easy to say Blake's apathetic, except that he seems intent on hiding from people hired by his record company to find him. He is certain of his own suicide before he commits it. The movie plays out like amorbid last meal.Van Sant purposely drains all the psychological pap and drama out of this story. This is the terminus of Blake's life, not the downward spiral. The tears have already been shed, the chances at recovery wasted.  The immensity of Blake's reduction denies him the ability to reach out, or be reached. The groupies hanging out in his castle ignore him. A bandmate (Scott Green) engages the singer only to tell him he wants to go to Utah. Blake's longest chat is with a (real) Yellow Pages salesman. When he speaks it's a whisper. When he sings, it's unintelligible. He swats invisible flies, hears bells in his head.""Last Days"" takes considerable discipline to appreciate. Unlike Van Sant's previous stunner, ""Elephant,"" there is no drive to the plot, no final movement, no climax. Scenes drag out beyond their purpose. How many times can Blake walk around in long underwear toting a shotgun? Why a scene of Blake preparing macaroni and cheese? Or the Boyz II Men video? Or the Yellow Pages salesman, Thaddeus A Thomas, who walked onto the set one day and was given, arguably, the movie's fourth biggest role?Van Sant walks the tightrope between commercial and Andy Warhol cinema, and here, possibly because he is too familiar with the subject, he indulges far more than he should, presuming the connection to Cobain will inject meaning where his camera has provided none. Pitt takes his role too literally, and makes Blake a fool without insight or kindness. I don't think we're supposed know what it is about Blake now that matters to music, but Pitt blocks us from knowing what it was. The director and actor are so intent on presentation they forget to say much of anything.",3,Little sound. Little fury.

You see a Kurt Cobain like figure walking around in the woods or in a big house.  He seems almost tiny compared to these larger things.

Yet as the film film progressed I became less and less concerned with the reasoning behind the unfolding events and started to simply 'feel' the tone of the film and where GVS was coming from in his interpretation of a modern tragedy.Essentially the only narrative in this film is that Cobain (given the name Blake in this) had left this earth before he pulled the trigger, it doesn't seek to document the potential real life sequence of events, it is simply a rumination and in my view a beautifully realised one to the point where I considered it a work of art.If you aren't interested or indifferent to Cobain then I'm not sure how you could enjoy this film because it demands a great degree of understanding and reverance for it's subject in order to appreciate what Van Sant is trying to communicate with it.

You see talkative detective played by Ricky Jay (no card tricks, just talk); plus Lukas Hass, Asia Argento, and some other cameos I didn't care.This is wildly fictional accounts of the death of Cobain, created by the imagination of Gus Van Sant, who opted for more anti-traditional method of narrative. This means the camera lingers on the figure of Blake/Cobain who keeps wandering, mumbling something, and for ordinary filmgoers like me it is excruciating to follow the action of him, even sleep-inducing. If you praise the film for artistic values (and you're entitled to it, I know) you still would have to admit that you are only watching, or perhaps admiring his intentions, or the `truth-of-life' approach of Gus Van Sant, not the life of someone the film is loosely based on.So here is a question - how can you say `Last Days' is not a phony when the film, clearly capitalizing on the fame of Cobain, is about one `Blake'? How can you say the film is interesting and refreshing when Gus Van Sant has already repeated the same `experimental' film-making formula in `Elephant' and Gerry' with his most detached touch?And most of all, just because the film is experimental doesn't mean that it is free from clich? - lingering camera, noisy soundtrack, `natural' lighting, shaky camerawork, etc. -- and in fact it looks like Gus Van Sant is counting on the favorable reactions from the understanding reviewers who are kind to defend, claiming the most obvious - this is experimental. Yes, I know it is. Still that doesn't change the fact the film is dull and self-indulgent.",2,"OK, This Is an Experimental Film, Right?

So shut up and accept the fact that not everyone likes Nirvana.Gus Van Sant's ""Last Days"" generated a mixed feeling in this reviewer's eyes.Let's start with the good. I liked how Blake's death is shown as a slow process, finally ending with his death. He doesn't go out in a blast as does many other deaths depicted in movies do. Not all suicides or ODs go out in a blast. There are no police or people there to talk to the suicidal person. It is just him, and him alone. No witnesses... just like Cobain's suicide.His anti-social, or total detachment from the real world, is perhaps depicted the best in this movie. Other movies show this type of behavior, too, but there's always outside noise and distractions present, possibly to keep the audience comfortable. The movie centers around Blake's own world... the way the world of a recluse is. I know this from personal experience. A quiet person makes people uncomfortable... Blake is the silent person, and we the audience therefore feel discomfort (which is most likely due to the fact that the camera following him around is boring, but isn't it just the same as hanging out with a really quiet person?). Gus Van Sant captured this behavior and feeling pitch-perfect.Now for the dislikes: everything else. No characters with much personality and hardly any significance to the non-existant plot. Blake's mumbling becomes tiresome (must we endure that for 90+ minutes?). The briefly mentioned fact of no plot. And yes, it is a tedioum to sit through, and its 90+ minutes feels like an eternity.Yes, this is ""loosely based on Kurt Cobain""... but Gus doesn't seem to know what that really means. C'mon... Blake wears the exact same outfits Kurt wore in his lifetime... even a woman's dress! Blake also has the exact same hairdo Kurt donned... and coincidentally enough, sings just like Kurt.The song Blake sings isn't until the movie is nearly over... and I think everything the movie is about lies in that song. Sure, before we see people wanting to seek some benefit from Blake (maybe contributing to his depression), and Kim Gordon's cameo tells us that at least one person cares for Blake, but they're so unclear due to Blake's mumbling.We don't really know what made Blake this way, nor do we know how he exactly dies (complete with his soul climbing into heaven)... all that matters is that we see how Blake is during his last days on Earth. Like what Richard Roeper said, perhaps Blake's first 27 years are more interesting than his last three days.Plus, what's with the gay sex scene? No, I'm not homophobic, but... why show it at all?Most people will loathe this movie... only about 10 people will love it. Some subtle parts are good, kinda funny at times, but overall, everything else sucks.The DVD sucks, too. Basically bare bones with a behind-the-scenes featurette that'll put you to sleep faster than the movie itself. Haven't seen the deleted scene(s), but I assume they too suck.",3,"I'd like to read thoughts, not complaints towards that PJ guy",1130198400,"10 25, 2005",2005,3109,"['Last', 'saw', 'review', 'page', 'movie', 'not', 'attacking', 'one', 'person', 'opinion', 'will', 'never', 'change', 'regardless', 'how', 'much', 'counterattack', 'argument', 'So', 'shut', 'up', 'accept', 'fact', 'not', 'everyone', 'Nirvana.Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'Last', 'Days', 'generated', 'mixed', 'feeling', 'reviewer', 'eyes.Let', 'start', 'good', 'liked', 'how', 'Blake', 'death', 'shown', 'slow', 'process', 'finally', 'ending', 'death', ""n't"", 'go', 'out', 'blast', 'many', 'other', 'deaths', 'depicted', 'movies', 'do', 'Not', 'suicides', 'ODs', 'go', 'out', 'blast', 'are', 'police', 'people', 'there', 'talk', 'suicidal', 'person', 'just', 'alone', 'No', 'witnesses', 'just', 'Cobain', 'suicide.His', 'anti-social', 'total', 'detachment', 'real', 'world', 'perhaps', 'depicted', 'best', 'movie', 'Other', 'movies', 'show', 'type', 'behavior', 'too', 'always', 'outside', 'noise', 'distractions', 'present', 'possibly', 'keep', 'audience', 'comfortable', 'movie', 'centers', 'Blake', 'own', 'world', 'way', 'world', 'recluse', 'know', 'personal', 'experience', 'quiet', 'person', 'people', 'uncomfortable', 'Blake', 'silent', 'person', 'audience', 'therefore', 'feel', 'discomfort', 'most', 'likely', 'due', 'fact', 'camera', 'following', 'around', 'boring', ""n't"", 'just', 'same', 'hanging', 'out', 'really', 'quiet', 'person', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'captured', 'behavior', 'feeling', 'pitch-perfect.Now', 'dislikes', 'everything', 'else', 'No', 'characters', 'much', 'personality', 'hardly', 'significance', 'non-existant', 'plot', 'Blake', 'mumbling', 'tiresome', 'must', 'endure', '90+', 'minutes', 'briefly', 'mentioned', 'fact', 'plot', 'yes', 'tedioum', 'sit', '90+', 'minutes', 'feels', 'eternity.Yes', 'loosely', 'based', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'Gus', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'what', 'really', ""C'mon"", 'Blake', 'exact', 'same', 'outfits', 'Kurt', 'wore', 'lifetime', 'even', 'woman', 'dress', 'Blake', 'also', 'exact', 'same', 'hairdo', 'Kurt', 'donned', 'coincidentally', 'enough', 'sings', 'just', 'Kurt.The', 'song', 'Blake', 'sings', ""n't"", 'movie', 'nearly', 'think', 'everything', 'movie', 'lies', 'song', 'Sure', 'see', 'people', 'wanting', 'seek', 'benefit', 'Blake', 'maybe', 'contributing', 'depression', 'Kim', 'Gordon', 'cameo', 'least', 'one', 'person', 'Blake', ""'re"", 'so', 'unclear', 'due', 'Blake', 'mumbling.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'made', 'Blake', 'way', 'do', 'know', 'how', 'exactly', 'complete', 'soul', 'climbing', 'heaven', 'matters', 'see', 'how', 'Blake', 'last', 'days', 'Earth', 'what', 'Richard', 'Roeper', 'said', 'perhaps', 'Blake', 'first', '27', 'years', 'are', 'more', 'interesting', 'last', 'three', 'days.Plus', 'what', 'gay', 'sex', 'scene', 'No', ""'m"", 'not', 'homophobic', 'why', 'show', 'Most', 'people', 'will', 'loathe', 'movie', 'only', '10', 'people', 'will', 'love', 'subtle', 'parts', 'are', 'good', 'kinda', 'funny', 'times', 'overall', 'everything', 'else', 'sucks.The', 'DVD', 'sucks', 'too', 'Basically', 'bare', 'bones', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', ""'ll"", 'put', 'sleep', 'faster', 'movie', 'Have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'deleted', 'scene', 's', 'assume', 'too', 'suck']",Gus Van Sant's Last Days

""Last Days"" is one long , silent scream for help, that goes unheard until it's too late. The sound and cinematography are pristine and beautiful and the pacing may seem slow but is painfully realistic in it's depiction of sadness, isolation and the loss of one's life force (or the dispersal of his chi as Ray Manzarek would put it) and will linger with the viewer for a long time. Kim Gordon makes a brief but memorable cameo as a record exec., and makes a final futile attempt at drawing Blake out of himself only to leave away empty handed.

934943,A3S98L5B1SR9P1,B000AYEL10,Zack H.,"[3, 6]","The film is not about the last days of Kurt Cobain, an observation that most film-goers, particularly Kurt Cobain fanboys (some of which, have only heard ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", and the ""Nevermind"" album about a thousand times, and claim him to be their savior, or whatever), seem to get stuck in their thought process, as they begin to read about and/or view this film. In the end, they feel like the film disappointed them, and that their hero's image was distorted and somehow ""ruined"" by this film.The film itself is actually a rather excellent and unique character study about a rock star junkie named Blake, who's going through the motions, experiencing the SAME mental and social isolation feelings that Cobain MAY HAVE experienced during his final days. Yes, Gus was obviously influenced to make this film by the whole Kurt Cobain phenomenon. Yes, Gus, you, and I know that it's obviously based on Kurt Cobain, and while the Blake character may resemble him in several aspects, in the end, he IS not Kurt at all.We can barely comprehend what the protagonist is saying throughout the whole film, and the film itself is rather silent, with minimal dialogue and action to hold most viewers' attention. I take it that Blake's mumbling depicts just how seperated he is from reality in the film, as he can barely make out his own thoughts and words in the film. He's just drifting around his house and friends, not knowing where to go, what to do, or how to help himself dig a hole to the surface, to escape from his own hell.I love how Blake's perspective is shown in third person viewing. The cinematography allows us to truly experience his isolation, from his perspective, while we're able to watch him experience it first hand. So, essentially, we are experiencing his ""Last Days"" from two point of views. The cinematography in the ""Death"" trilogy is truly amazing.The most haunting aspect of the film was Blake's friends.They kept him around, just so they could pry money and shelter off of him. They were merely acquaintances to him now, and in some scenes, they show how much they can care less about Blake's situation. For example *SPOILERS*, the scene where Blake falls while watching the Boys II Men video. Asia finds him, but doesn't even notify the others of his condition. She just props him up against the wall, and leaves him where he is, and goes about her day.The way the characters are just capable of extracting anything they please out of the lead character while he's going through withdrawal from reality and himself is disturbing to me.I should point out, and know for sure, that not everyone will find this film watchable, or even tolerable. The film definitely will not cater entertainment to a mainstream audience. I figured that ""Elephant"" was Van Sant's best after I saw this film for the first time, but now, I'm starting to think that ""Last Days"" may just be the masterpiece of his ""Death"" trilogy, and is certainly one of his best films to date.",5,A truly misunderstood character study.,1179100800,"05 14, 2007",2007,2982,"['film', 'not', 'last', 'days', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'observation', 'most', 'film-goers', 'particularly', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'fanboys', 'have', 'only', 'heard', 'Smells', 'Teen', 'Spirit', 'Nevermind', 'album', 'thousand', 'times', 'claim', 'be', 'savior', 'seem', 'get', 'stuck', 'thought', 'process', 'begin', 'read', 'and/or', 'view', 'film', 'end', 'feel', 'film', 'disappointed', 'hero', 'image', 'was', 'distorted', 'somehow', 'ruined', 'film.The', 'film', 'actually', 'rather', 'excellent', 'unique', 'character', 'study', 'rock', 'star', 'junkie', 'named', 'Blake', 'who', 'going', 'motions', 'experiencing', 'SAME', 'mental', 'social', 'isolation', 'feelings', 'Cobain', 'MAY', 'HAVE', 'experienced', 'final', 'days', 'Yes', 'Gus', 'was', 'obviously', 'influenced', 'make', 'film', 'whole', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'phenomenon', 'Yes', 'Gus', 'know', 'obviously', 'based', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'Blake', 'character', 'may', 'resemble', 'several', 'aspects', 'end', 'not', 'Kurt', 'all.We', 'can', 'barely', 'comprehend', 'what', 'protagonist', 'saying', 'whole', 'film', 'film', 'rather', 'silent', 'minimal', 'dialogue', 'action', 'hold', 'most', 'viewers', 'attention', 'take', 'Blake', 'mumbling', 'just', 'how', 'seperated', 'reality', 'film', 'can', 'barely', 'make', 'out', 'own', 'thoughts', 'words', 'film', 'just', 'drifting', 'house', 'friends', 'not', 'knowing', 'where', 'go', 'what', 'do', 'how', 'help', 'dig', 'hole', 'surface', 'escape', 'own', 'hell.I', 'love', 'how', 'Blake', 'perspective', 'shown', 'third', 'person', 'viewing', 'cinematography', 'truly', 'experience', 'isolation', 'perspective', ""'re"", 'able', 'watch', 'experience', 'first', 'hand', 'So', 'essentially', 'are', 'experiencing', 'Last', 'Days', 'two', 'point', 'views', 'cinematography', 'Death', 'trilogy', 'truly', 'amazing.The', 'most', 'haunting', 'aspect', 'film', 'was', 'Blake', 'friends.They', 'kept', 'around', 'just', 'could', 'pry', 'money', 'shelter', 'were', 'merely', 'acquaintances', 'now', 'scenes', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'care', 'less', 'Blake', 'situation', 'example', '*SPOILERS*', 'scene', 'where', 'Blake', 'watching', 'Boys', 'II', 'Men', 'video', 'Asia', ""n't"", 'even', 'notify', 'others', 'condition', 'just', 'props', 'up', 'wall', 'where', 'day.The', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'capable', 'extracting', 'anything', 'please', 'lead', 'character', 'going', 'withdrawal', 'reality', 'disturbing', 'me.I', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'know', 'sure', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'watchable', 'even', 'tolerable', 'film', 'definitely', 'will', 'not', 'cater', 'entertainment', 'mainstream', 'audience', 'figured', 'Elephant', 'was', 'Van', 'Sant', 'best', 'saw', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'now', ""'m"", 'starting', 'think', 'Last', 'Days', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'masterpiece', 'Death', 'trilogy', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'date']",Gus Van Sant's Last Days
