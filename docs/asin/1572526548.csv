187852,A2WNWQT4OIPNBK,1572526548,Kelly Hanna,"[2, 2]","I once ate some Domino's pizza, about 15 years or so ago.  It disagreed with me, violently.  I was sick for three days, not knowing which end was going to explode first, or if it was going to be both at the same time.  The putrefying stench was the most vile thing on earth.  It was hard to believe that the human body was capable of emitting such a noisome horror.  The smell permeated every room in the house and lingered, despite opening the doors and windows.  Dogs out on the street vomited uncontrollably.  Insects died in mid-flight.  Virgins in a tri country area were immaculately deflowered (or not so immaculately).  By the end, it felt like I was excreting battery acid, I was praying for merciful death to come take me away.  It was bad.This movie was worse.I will confess that I have a spot in my heart for campy, cheesy, B-Movies.  At first, I thought thats what I was watching, though B-movie would have been a compliment in this case.  However about 30 minutes into the movie, I realized that this movie was actually taking itself seriously.  Before I came to the realization that this was intended to be serious, I actually thought it might have been some sort of bizarre homage to gay films.  The main character dude was always oiled up, flexing, and striking these bizarre poses.  He managed to lose his shirt in almost every scene.  They stated that he had a girlfriend, but I honestly expected him to ride off into the sunset with Costas Mandylor, side-saddle, on the back of a pink unicorn.The sets.  They could have watched Mad Max a couple more times to get it down.  A post apocalyptic world should be dirty.  There should be rubble and debris scattered around.  This seemed too clean somehow.  If I had studied theater or cinema, I could probably give a better description of why the setting just didnt seem right.  But then if I had studied theater or cinema and had watched this, I probably would have felt obliged to gouge my own eyes out.The actors.  When you're watching the intro credits and see Downtown Julie Brown, Chris Penn, and Clint Howard, you know what you're getting into.  The main character, Ken.  At first I thought it was Ben Stiller from the clips of Tropic Thunder, where he was playing the lone wolf survivor type hero in a post apocalyptic world.  Those were humorous spoofs of such type movies.  This wasnt humorous, it was trying to take that character and make a story about him.  Which could actually have been pretty funny, if played to that.Speaking of the story, its pretty difficult to follow.  From what I could discern, Oily-good-guy's dad is the master of the Fist of the North Star.  Costas Mandylor is the master of the Southern Cross.  World War III breaks out and it now rains acid.  The two kung fu schools can never fight each other, or presumably bad things will happen, theres prophecy and such.  Prophecy states that they musnt ever fight.  I would guess that if the kung fu school of the Fist of the North Star and the school of the Southern Cross ever fought each other, the consequences would be dire, like they would make a bad live action film with some second rate actors.  Oh, wait....Anyway, Costas beats the tar outta the flexing good guy and steals his girlfriend.  To add insult to injury, or maybe the other way around, Costas stick his fingers into the good guy.  The good guy, violated, wanders off into the wastes.  Costas goes to flexy good guy's dad and shoots him dead.  This apparently bequeathes mystical powers on flexy good guy.  Dead dad floats in the air and says profound things about justice and vengeance, pretty much what you'd expect really.  I got the impression that oily good guy was kind of a disappointment to his dad.  But then he did abandon his girlfriend and let strange men stick their fingers in him.  I'd be disappointed too, all things considered.Costas kills some guy who wandered into his house.  His bad guys kill a bunch of people who apparently mine canned goods.  We have a flashback scene where oily good guy gives his girlfriend his sack of nuts, right before wandering off.  Said girlfriend spends some time opening the sack and gazing, mournfully, at oily good guy's nuts.  Costas find girlfriend holding onto the nuts and smacks them out of her hand, sending the nuts flying about the room.Oily good guy goes to Costas' house and beats the heck out of a bunch of minions, who conveniently all attack from the front and in limited numbers.  Usually one or two at a time.  Sometimes one who has a weapon of some sort will attack, but only when the good guy has a couple seconds to brace himself for the attack and take the weapon away.  You've seen these movies, you know the drill.  The minions all lie on the ground, sufficiently pummeled, paving the way to the end boss, I mean Costas.Theres the penultimate death fight between oily guy and Costas.  The girlfriend spends some time running away from Chris Penn, which lets be honest, probably isnt the first time thats happened in Chris's life.And Costas kills oily good guy.  Hah, just kidding, you know that didnt happen.  Oily good guy wins the day, gets the girl, and goes on to do something.  I'm guessing he's probably concerned with picking up his nuts.  The minions, those who survived, all bow down to the girlfriend and oily good guy.  Presumably, the peaceful villagers go back to collecting cans.I'd like to say that this isnt the worst movie I've ever seen.  I just dont think I can do it.  It has every hackneyed cliche ever written.  The fight scenes are terrible.  You can see some of the punches and kicks falling well short of their marks.  When you're looking to Downtown Julie Brown for the premiere acting in the movie, its bad.In ending my review on a positive note, I will say that I am relatively sure I will never see a worse movie.  Thats the kindest thing I have to say after watching this.  So watching this was, in a way, sort of a relief.  Everything will be better after this.",1,Domino's pizza - spoilers,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,5982,"['once', 'ate', 'Domino', 'pizza', '15', 'years', 'so', 'ago', 'disagreed', 'violently', 'was',

187855,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,1572526548,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[2, 2]","First of all, I am not familiar with the manga or the anime this movie is based on, and thus will not review the film in comparison to its source material. I simply like martial arts movies and I like Gary Daniels, and thus am reviewing this film as such. In this pursuit, I ended up with mixed results: while the stylishness of the production puts to shame the low-budget hackfests that Daniels has been a part of, the action content - Gary's main strength - fails to live up the standards he's capable of reaching. Then there's the plot, which is interesting enough but certainly not an everyman's affair and doesn't really feel very anime-ish. You really ought to know yourself before buying this one: it has the potential to be both a good time-waster or a big waste of life.The story: Kenshiro (Daniels,The Expendables), the last surviving practitioner of the fabled North Star style of fighting, wanders the wastelands of a dying world ruled by his nemesis, the evil Lord Shin (Costas Mandylor,Picket Fences). Urged on by his long-deceased master (Malcolm McDowell,A Clockwork Orange) and the plight of an estranged settlement under attack by Shin's hordes, he must master himself to cease the oppression and rescue his beautiful lover (Isako Washio) from the tyrant.What we have here is pretty much a classy post-apocalyptic desert action movie, which is - in case you don't know - a subgenre of its own. This is the film that the likes ofDune WarriorsorThe Last Warriorwish they could have be: not only does ""First of the North Star"" have distinguishable art direction, but it's a movie with an actual plot, notable characters that aren't forgotten the moment they're offscreen, and defined beginning, middle, and end acts - not just a bunch of explosions melded together by amateur script readings. As a representative of 'wasteland films', the movie is extremely promising...but as most anything else, it's lacking. Though it boasts a neat cast - including Chris Penn (Reservoir Dogs) as Shin's top henchman, ex-MTV personality Downtown Julie Brown and Melvin Van Peebles (Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song) as leaders of the targeted village, and Dante Basco (Hook) as Kenshiro's quasi-sidekick - very few of the characters are actually relevant to the story in the long run. Granted, most of them are pretty animated and presentable, but very few of their ongoings affect the main stars of the film directly.What I was most interested in, of course, was the film's martial arts content. Again, we're presented with a mixed bag: Daniels has both the forms and the moves (not to mention a nifty acupressure attack with which he can make guys' heads explode off-camera), but the fights are short and infrequent. What's worse, as is the case in several of Gary's movies, most of the encounters fall prey to overzealous editing and cheap camera angles that stifle coolness. Luckily, near the end of the movie, Daniels breaks this trend and tears down the house as he takes care of about twenty villains thrown at him in turn with his awesome kicks and a pair of rattan sticks. Had this been the standard of the rest of the film, I'd likely be adding another star to the rating, but since the very next fight (the final showdown with Lord Shin) reverts back to the so-so style of cinefighting, I can't deem it more than passable.From the tone of some of the other reviews I've read, being a fan of the original series doesn't guarantee you as a fan of this one, so it's safe to say that your best bet of having a good time with this is being in it mainly for Gary and his hunky bod. It's worth owning if you're a fan of the man, but unless the film's scale or storyline manages to impress you, it might not crack your personal top-ten list.",3,"""It's not easy, being sleazy""",1262995200,"01 9, 2010",2010,3746,"['First', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'manga', 'anime', 'movie', 'based', 'thus', 'will', 'not', 'review', 'film', 'comparison', 'source', 'material', 'simply', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'like', 'Gary', 'Daniels', 'thus', 'am', 'reviewing', 'film', 'such', 'pursuit', 'ended', 'up', 'mixed', 'results', 'stylishness', 'production', 'shame', 'low-budget', 'hackfests', 'Daniels', 'been', 'part', 'action', 'content', 'Gary', 'main', 'strength', 'fails', 'live', 'up', 'standards', 'capable', 'reaching', 'Then', 'plot', 'interesting', 'enough', 'certainly', 'not', 'everyman', 'affair', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'very', 'anime-ish', 'really', 'ought', 'know', 'buying', 'one', 'potential', 'be', 'good', 'time-waster', 'big', 'waste', 'life.The', 'story', 'Kenshiro', 'Daniels', 'Expendables', 'last', 'surviving', 'practitioner', 'fabled', 'North', 'Star', 'style', 'fighting', 'wastelands', 'dying', 'world', 'ruled', 'nemesis', 'evil', 'Lord', 'Shin', 'Costas', 'Mandylor', 'Picket', 'Fences', 'Urged', 'long-deceased', 'master', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'plight', 'estranged', 'settlement', 'attack', 'Shin', 'hordes', 'must', 'master', 'cease', 'oppression', 'rescue', 'beautiful', 'lover', 'Isako', 'Washio', 'tyrant.What', 'have', 'here', 'pretty', 'much', 'classy', 'post-apocalyptic', 'desert', 'action', 'movie', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'subgenre', 'own', 'film', 'likes', 'ofDune', 'WarriorsorThe', 'Last', 'Warriorwish', 'could', 'have', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'First', 'North', 'Star', 'have', 'distinguishable', 'art', 'direction', 'movie', 'actual', 'plot', 'notable', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'forgotten', 'moment', ""'re"", 'offscreen', 'defined', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'acts', 'not', 'just', 'bunch', 'explosions', 'melded', 'together', 'amateur', 'script', 'readings', 'representative', ""'wasteland"", 'films', 'movie', 'extremely', 'promising', 'most', 'anything', 'else', 'lacking', 'neat', 'cast', 'including', 'Chris', 'Penn', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'Shin', 'top', 'henchman', 'ex-MTV', 'personality', 'Downtown', 'Julie', 'Brown', 'Melvin', 'Van', 'Peebles', 'Sweet', 'Sweetback', 'Baadasssss', 'Song', 'leaders', 'targeted', 'village', 'Dante', 'Basco', 'Hook', 'Kenshiro', 'quasi-sidekick', 'very', 'few', 'characters', 'are', 'actually', 'relevant', 'story', 'long', 'run', 'Granted', 'most', 'are', 'pretty', 'animated', 'presentable', 'very', 'few', 'ongoings', 'affect', 'main', 'stars', 'film', 'was', 'most', 'interested', 'course', 'was', 'film', 'martial', 'arts', 'content', 'Again', ""'re"", 'presented', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Daniels', 'forms', 'moves', 'not', 'mention', 'nifty', 'acupressure', 'attack', 'can', 'make', 'guys', 'heads', 'explode', 'off-camera', 'fights', 'are', 'short', 'infrequent', 'What', 'worse', 'case', 'several', 'Gary', 'movies', 'most', 'encounters', 'fall', 'prey', 'overzealous', 'editing', 'cheap', 'camera', 'stifle', 'coolness', 'Luckily', 'end', 'movie', 'Daniels', 'trend', 'tears', 'down', 'house', 'care', 'twenty', 'villains', 'thrown', 'turn', 'awesome', 'kicks', 'pair', 'rattan', 'sticks', 'Had', 'been', 'standard', 'rest', 'film', ""'d"", 'likely', 'be', 'adding', 'star', 'rating', 'very', 'next', 'fight', 'final', 'showdown', 'Lord', 'Shin', 'back', 'so-so', 'style', 'cinefighting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deem', 'more', 'tone', 'other', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'being', 'fan', 'original', 'series', ""n't"", 'guarantee', 'fan', 'one', 'safe', 'say', 'best', 'bet', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'being', 'mainly', 'Gary', 'hunky', 'bod', 'worth', 'owning', ""'re"", 'fan', 'man', 'film', 'scale', 'storyline', 'manages', 'impress', 'might', 'not', 'crack', 'personal', 'top-ten', 'list']",N/A
187856,A1KI6L82M5RAHQ,1572526548,mr. snrub,"[11, 17]","British Kickboxer Gary Daniels has had a long and fantastic career in direct-to-DVD martial arts movies (I'm now updating this review to point out that Gary will be seen portraying Bryan Fury in the upcoming Tekken movie, and was recently seen as ""The Brit"" who gets to go toe-to-toe with Jet Li and Jason Statham in Slyvester Stallone's action star schmorgasboard, ""The Expendables"".) He has ocassionally worked with Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson, and though most of his movies are pretty good, they are generally made with budgets and production values that make Don's movies look like they were made for millions.Not being familiar with the FIST OF THE NORTH STAR comic books or animated series when I first saw the movie (though I am now an avid fan), I could not judge this movie based on comic book standards. But I could judge it as both a martial arts fan and Gary Daniels fan, and from that criteria I can say without hyperbole.......FIST OF THE NORTH STAR IS GARY DANIELS BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!It's got a great story, plenty of martial arts, and an absolutely beautiful leading lady, Isako Washio. I can guarantee you will not find yourself bored during the non-martial arts scenes, since Isako is in most of them.I am rather surpirsed that many fans are disappointed with FIST OF THE NORTH STAR, many saying that it failed to capture the essence of Kenshiro's world. They couldn't be more wrong. FIST OF THE NORTH STAR is very true to the comic and the anime, and in many ways, works as just a tribute to martial arts movies, as well as martial arts themselves.It's also a superhero movie, with Kenshiro bearing his seven scars on his chest in the pattern of the big dipper as his own superhero emblem. And it has more than a few parallels with Judeo-Christianty. Kenshiro restores sight to a blind girl, for starters. He is also essentially crucified by the evil Lord Shin (Costas Mandylor) for refusing to side with him, and Lord Shin gives him his seven scars, which are not unlike Jesus's cross and spear wounds. And, of course, the concept that the messiah must bear the cross for the world to be saved is interestingly illustrated in Kenshiro, Master of Hokuto Shinken (North Star God Fist, which can essentially be shortened to ""Fist of God"") being ""crucifed"" by Lord Shin, movie's Satan, who is the master of Nanto Seiken (Southern Cross Holy Fist).And to top that off, Kenshiro being under the spiritual guidance of his Father, Ryuken (Malcom McDowell), well, I think we all know what that's in reference to.As for the martial arts combat sequences, well, let me just say that any messianic hero whose martial arts maneuvers include literally blowing up his opponents with a series of speedy punches can make any movie work.Bruce Lee would have loved this movie.",5,Bruce Lee would have loved this movie,1106092800,"01 19, 2005",2005,2775,"['British', 'Kickboxer', 'Gary', 'Daniels', 'had', 'long', 'fantastic', 'career', 'direct-to-DVD', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', ""'m"", 'now', 'updating', 'review', 'point', 'out', 'Gary', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'portraying', 'Bryan', 'Fury', 'upcoming', 'Tekken', 'movie', 'was', 'recently', 'seen', 'Brit', 'who', 'go', 'toe-to-toe', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'Slyvester', 'Stallone', 'action', 'star', 'schmorgasboard', 'Expendables', 'ocassionally', 'worked', 'Don', 'Dragon', 'Wilson', 'most', 'movies', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'generally', 'made', 'budgets', 'production', 'values', 'make', 'Don', 'movies', 'look', 'were', 'made', 'millions.Not', 'being', 'familiar', 'FIST', 'THE', 'NORTH', 'STAR', 'comic', 'books', 'animated', 'series', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'am', 'now', 'avid', 'fan', 'could', 'not', 'judge', 'movie', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'standards', 'could', 'judge', 'martial', 'arts', 'fan', 'Gary', 'Daniels', 'fan', 'criteria', 'can', 'say', 'hyperbole', '.FIST', 'THE', 'NORTH', 'STAR', 'IS', 'GARY', 'DANIELS', 'BEST', 'MOVIE', 'EVER', 'got', 'great', 'story', 'plenty', 'martial', 'arts', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'leading', 'lady', 'Isako', 'Washio', 'can', 'guarantee', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'bored', 'non-martial', 'arts', 'scenes', 'Isako', 'most', 'them.I', 'am', 'rather', 'surpirsed', 'many', 'fans', 'are', 'disappointed', 'FIST', 'THE', 'NORTH', 'STAR', 'many', 'saying', 'failed', 'capture', 'essence', 'Kenshiro', 'world', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'wrong', 'FIST', 'THE', 'NORTH', 'STAR', 'very', 'true', 'comic', 'anime', 'many', 'ways', 'as', 'just', 'tribute', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'as', 'well', 'martial', 'arts', 'themselves.It', 'also', 'superhero', 'movie', 'Kenshiro', 'bearing', 'seven', 'scars', 'chest', 'pattern', 'big', 'dipper', 'own', 'superhero', 'emblem', 'more', 'few', 'parallels', 'Judeo-Christianty', 'Kenshiro', 'sight', 'blind', 'girl', 'starters', 'also', 'essentially', 'crucified', 'evil', 'Lord', 'Shin', 'Costas', 'Mandylor', 'refusing', 'side', 'Lord', 'Shin', 'seven', 'scars', 'are', 'not', 'Jesus', 'cross', 'spear', 'wounds', 'course', 'concept', 'messiah', 'must', 'bear', 'cross', 'world', 'be', 'saved', 'interestingly', 'illustrated', 'Kenshiro', 'Master', 'Hokuto', 'Shinken', 'North', 'Star', 'God', 'Fist', 'can', 'essentially', 'be', 'shortened', 'Fist', 'God', 'being', 'crucifed', 'Lord', 'Shin', 'movie', 'Satan', 'who', 'master', 'Nanto', 'Seiken', 'Southern', 'Cross', 'Holy', 'Fist', 'top', 'off', 'Kenshiro', 'being', 'spiritual', 'guidance', 'Father', 'Ryuken', 'Malcom', 'McDowell', 'well', 'think', 'know', 'what', 'reference', 'to.As', 'martial', 'arts', 'combat', 'sequences', 'well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'messianic', 'hero', 'martial', 'arts', 'maneuvers', 'include', 'literally', 'blowing', 'up', 'opponents', 'series', 'speedy', 'punches', 'can', 'make', 'movie', 'work.Bruce', 'Lee', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'movie']",N/A

Those films usually included Japanese actors as part of main cast or supports, and many of them were theatrically released in Japan (though none of them became a commercial hit). Today not many people know such titles as `No Way Back' (featuring then unknown Russell Crowe and Kelly Hu), `Countdown' (with Lori Petty'), `Final Vendetta' (with Brigitte Wilson) and `Crying Freeman' (directed by Christophe Gans). Except for `Crying Freeman' which is a decent action film, they are mostly unremarkable films.`Fist of the North Star' was made during this period. The big difference is that its post-WWIII story derives from hugely popular Japanese manga series `Fist of the North Star' (`Hokuto no Ken'). Ask any Japanese under 40, and you will realize the popularity of the series. Well, not everyone liked it, but this comic created by Buronson and Tesuo Hara.became popular during the 1980s, and then TV animation version started, which also became a hit.But this live-action version of `North Star' falls flat completely. It uses the earlier chapters of the original comic as the main story, in which we follow the battles of a stoic fighter named Kenshiro (Gary Daniels) in the bleak, post-apocalyptic world plagued with violence. Blood thirsty gangsters attack the villagers, and they steal and kill mercilessly. It is the world of the second `Mad Max' film (which greatly influenced the original comic), but unlike Mel Gibson's character Kenshiro (whose character is partly based on Bruce Lee) fights the villains with his original kung-fu, which causes the enemy's body explode (yes, literally, like `The `Scanners').Unfortunately, however, it doesn't happen in this film because it is so CHEAP! The unimaginative production designs are mainly about mud, old factory, and wilderness with green screen behind it. Nothing is thrilling in here - you see hammy Clint Howard playing a despicable baddie with hammy Chris Penn playing another despicable baddie. Japanese actress Isako Washio plays bland Julia, Kenshiro's love, and it is not a good sign when you see Malcolm McDowell sitting like a Buddhist monk.The story is sometimes hard to follow because of its confusing narrative, and it often goes on and on with talks, talks, and talks. Former kick-boxing champion Gary Daniels can show very good fight scenes, and he surely shows them briefly, but when that happens, the film is almost over.My advice is again `Stick to the original' or in this case, original Japanese cartoon series.
