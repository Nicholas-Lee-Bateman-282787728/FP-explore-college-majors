1062825,AOXX0U2T2BGYM,B000O77M0A,A Human,"[0, 0]","This series is a psychological mystery-murder series based in the early eighties.It's about 3 girls, and 1 boy, who live in a small town in Japan. This town has some rather dark secrets.You're supposed to find out what's truth,and what's just delusions, or false. However, it's easier said then done, since this is an adaptation of a sound novel series and lacks a lot of the original content. However, it's still great.This is a great dub, but you can change it to the japanese version with subtitles if you want.I sort of dislike this arc, due to future arc reasons, but it's still a great arc.Keiichi, the protagonist, is a 16 year old boy. The ""villians"" in this arc are a 15 year old girl, Rena, and a 17 year old girl, Mion, who are his best friends, and love interests. There are two 9 year olds, but they don't really do anything in this arc.",5,"Not for kids,trust me.",1248739200,"07 28, 2009",2009,850,"['series', 'psychological', 'mystery-murder', 'series', 'based', 'early', 'eighties.It', '3', 'girls', '1', 'boy', 'who', 'live', 'small', 'town', 'Japan', 'town', 'rather', 'dark', 'secrets.You', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'truth', 'what', 'just', 'delusions', 'false', 'However', 'easier', 'said', 'then', 'done', 'adaptation', 'sound', 'novel', 'series', 'lot', 'original', 'content', 'However', 'still', 'great.This', 'great', 'dub', 'can', 'change', 'japanese', 'version', 'subtitles', 'want.I', 'sort', 'dislike', 'arc', 'due', 'future', 'arc', 'reasons', 'still', 'great', 'arc.Keiichi', 'protagonist', '16', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'villians', 'arc', 'are', '15', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'Rena', '17', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'Mion', 'who', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'love', 'interests', 'are', 'two', '9', 'year', 'olds', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'anything', 'arc']","When They Cry, Vol. 1"

Christopher Blackshere ""Mackshere""","[0, 2]","After some constant prodding from some influential and demanding sources, I picked up this first volume of When They Cry.  I was blown away!  Amazingly creepy anime horror, no doubt.  It entails youth, friendship, tension, murder, mystery, betrayal--this initially has all the elements to be quite animeazing.  At least that was my reaction to the first 4 parts of volume 1.  A must see for anime fans.But a word of warning--the series takes a bewildering step next.  I was confused and irritated by part 1 vol. 2.  It almost seems like a prequel, except the kids actually appear older.  Hmmm, this might be brilliant, but it could be retarded.  I plan to watch more, and I imagine it will all play out fine.  At least I hope.Anyway, definitely watch this first volume, then proceed with caution.",5,the terror beneath,1233187200,"01 29, 2009",2009,796,"['constant', 'prodding', 'influential', 'demanding', 'sources', 'picked', 'up', 'first', 'volume', 'When', 'Cry', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'Amazingly', 'creepy', 'anime', 'horror', 'doubt', 'youth', 'friendship', 'tension', 'murder', 'mystery', 'betrayal', 'initially', 'elements', 'be', 'quite', 'animeazing', 'least', 'was', 'reaction', 'first', '4', 'parts', 'volume', '1', 'must', 'see', 'anime', 'word', 'warning', 'series', 'bewildering', 'step', 'was', 'confused', 'irritated', 'part', '1', 'vol', '2', 'almost', 'prequel', 'kids', 'actually', 'appear', 'older', 'Hmmm', 'might', 'be', 'brilliant', 'could', 'be', 'retarded', 'plan', 'watch', 'more', 'imagine', 'will', 'all', 'play', 'out', 'fine', 'least', 'hope.Anyway', 'definitely', 'watch', 'first', 'volume', 'then', 'proceed', 'caution']","When They Cry, Vol. 1"

1062828,A2NUNL9HBKEKDB,B000O77M0A,Johann K. Schmidt,"[2, 3]","""Higurashi no Naku Koro ni"" or as it has apparently been incorrectly translated into ""When they cry"" (it should have been ""When the Cicadas Cry"").  Is a grade A anime, for those of you who enjoy long drawn out stories that keep a central mystery hidden from the viewer until the end of the series (around 50 episodes or so).  In that way the series is sort of like ""Lost"" except far, far, far more violent and disturbing.  Though unlike ""Lost"" this anime does have an ending with an actual answer.So if you can handle a long drawn out show and have the stomach for some truly brutal violence directed at children or children directed at other children or children directed at adults then by all means get this anime.  Not to make it sound like that happens in every scene, most of the show is dedicated towards the relationships between the characters, progress towards figuring out what is going on and usually a problem for that story arc that confronts them, that at least in beginning usually ends badly.If you're wondering what a Cicadas is.  It's an insect that can make a loud buzzing sound.  You hear it a lot in this anime and others as the insect enjoys warm tropical weather.  So as you can see the title doesn't exactly mean cry, as in I'm sad, it also means cry like a baby kitten's cry for its mother.  Get it, cry = sound.  The whole title is a round about way of saying summer time, which is what the characters of this anime find themselves reliving over and over.",5,Disturbing but great.,1230940800,"01 3, 2009",2009,1481,"['Higurashi', 'Naku', 'Koro', 'ni', 'apparently', 'been', 'incorrectly', 'translated', 'When', 'cry', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'When', 'Cicadas', 'Cry', 'grade', 'anime', 'who', 'enjoy', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'stories', 'keep', 'central', 'mystery', 'hidden', 'viewer', 'end', 'series', '50', 'episodes', 'so', 'way', 'series', 'sort', 'Lost', 'far', 'far', 'far', 'more', 'violent', 'disturbing', 'Lost', 'anime', 'have', 'ending', 'actual', 'answer.So', 'can', 'handle', 'long', 'drawn', 'show', 'have', 'stomach', 'truly', 'brutal', 'violence', 'directed', 'children', 'children', 'directed', 'other', 'children', 'children', 'directed', 'adults', 'then', 'means', 'get', 'anime', 'Not', 'make', 'sound', 'scene', 'most', 'show', 'dedicated', 'relationships', 'characters', 'progress', 'towards', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'usually', 'problem', 'story', 'confronts', 'least', 'beginning', 'usually', 'badly.If', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'what', 'Cicadas', 'insect', 'can', 'make', 'loud', 'buzzing', 'sound', 'hear', 'lot', 'anime', 'others', 'insect', 'warm', 'tropical', 'weather', 'So', 'can', 'see', 'title', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'mean', 'cry', ""'m"", 'sad', 'also', 'cry', 'baby', 'kitten', 'cry', 'mother', 'Get', '=', 'sound', 'whole', 'title', 'round', 'way', 'saying', 'summer', 'time', 'what', 'characters', 'anime', 'find', 'reliving']","When They Cry, Vol. 1"
1062829,A3LIWTQDSQ5UOO,B000O77M0A,"Jonathan Oyama ""Welcome to die!""","[15, 16]","Higurashi is a lengthy and shocking. Yet, the sadistic (but cute) characters really make this anime hilarious. Yes, there is plenty of killing, but I really enjoyed watching the out-of-place cute youngsters turn into cold-blooded murderers for the most insanely unbelievable reasons.Meiichi Maebara, a teenage boy, lives in Hinamizawa, a peaceful rural village. He plays and has fun with his friends, all girls. However, he quickly learns that Hinamizawa is a cursed town, in which every year at the Watanagashi Festival at least one person dies.To make matters worse, his friends are trying to hide the truth from him--that they could have killed those people. Rena keeps creeping up to Maebara with a huge knife, the doctors inject him with needles, and people are dying left and right.And yet, after Maebara commits suicide by stabbing his throat with his fingernails, the characters come back to life...Well, not really.Higurashi no naku koro ni (When They Cry) is actually based on a drama video game. There are many different chapters with different takes on the same story. For the first four chapters, lots of people die, and there is no happy ending. The next four chapters, however, give the reasons for the deaths. And yes, there is a happy ending in the last chapter.However, this is a surprisingly complex soap opera, involving children who are abused by their aunts and uncles, kill others because they are in love and get possessed by ogre spirits. Yes, maybe this story is a little too unbelievable, but the murderers' motives are so bizarre and strange that the series actually turns into a comedy. The alternative plots are very intriguing, each one revealing another piece to the fascinating plot which involves drugs, UFO crashes and, yes, bioterrorism (don't ask).This series is crazy, bloody and definitely not for kids. However, its storytelling is very gutsy, original and hilarious. There's nothing better than watching little kids kill each other for the stupidest reasons in a crazy town filled with conspiracies.

At the beginning of the series you'll feel that you're watching a harem comedy, you know the lucky guy that spends time with his girlfriends at school, they make fun of him he makes fun them you get the picture.  In the second episode you'll see a 180 change from comedy to the chilling mystery of the gruesome deaths in the village caused by unknown forces at the Cotton Drifting Festival.  From here Keiichi our ""lucky"" guy is threatened and disturbed by his classmates, like when they delivered food for him just make this cruel prank involving needles.I don't want to spoil too much but I'll say that this series can be compare to TALES FROM THE CRYPT (the series), at the beginning there is comedy, the middle has the involving plot and the ending has that disturbing twist.  You'll understand why when you see episode 5.The plot was very intriguing it was like watching Phone Booth, Enemy of the State or Taxi Driver for the first time.Yes there are few scenes of violence but the series is more suspense than horror.If you like Elfen Lied or Gantz then this is must have for your collection.",5,cuteness with bloody violence.,1181606400,"06 12, 2007",2007,1206,"['very', 'eye', 'catching', 'anime', 'colorful', 'characters', 'cute', 'lolis', 'disturbing', 'violence', 'beginning', 'series', ""'ll"", 'feel', ""'re"", 'watching', 'harem', 'comedy', 'know', 'lucky', 'guy', 'time', 'girlfriends', 'school', 'make', 'fun', 'fun', 'get', 'picture', 'second', 'episode', ""'ll"", 'see', '180', 'change', 'comedy', 'chilling', 'mystery', 'gruesome', 'deaths', 'village', 'caused', 'unknown', 'forces', 'Cotton', 'Drifting', 'Festival', 'here', 'Keiichi', 'lucky', 'guy', 'threatened', 'disturbed', 'classmates', 'when', 'delivered', 'food', 'just', 'make', 'cruel', 'prank', 'involving', 'needles.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'too', 'much', ""'ll"", 'say', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'compare', 'TALES', 'THE', 'CRYPT', 'series', 'beginning', 'comedy', 'middle', 'involving', 'plot', 'ending', 'disturbing', 'twist', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'why', 'when', 'see', 'episode', '5.The', 'plot', 'was', 'very', 'intriguing', 'was', 'watching', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'Enemy', 'State', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'first', 'time.Yes', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'violence', 'series', 'more', 'suspense', 'horror.If', 'Elfen', 'Lied', 'Gantz', 'then', 'must', 'have', 'collection']","When They Cry, Vol. 1"
1062831,A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T,B000O77M0A,Sesho,"[4, 9]","In June 1983 a young teen named Keiichi arrives in the sleepy village of Hinamizawa and quickly becomes friends with a clique of four girls named Mion, Rena, Satoko, and Rika. They are all cute and seemingly innocent until Keiichi begins to hear stories about the annual Cotton-Drifting Festival. There is nothing sinister about the ceremony itself, but for the past couple of years, the festival has been accompanied by mysterious deaths, murders, and disapperances. The locals believe it to be the work of the village's god, Oyashiro. All the weird stuff started happening several years ago when the government decided to build a dam near the village that would have completely submerged it under water. The villagers revolted and even killed and dismembered one of the construction workers. Work was halted and the plans for the dam abandoned. But it is thought that Oyashiro is still wreaking its revenge against those connected to the project. A cop in a nearby city thinks that the girls surrounding Keiichi are somehow involved in all the strange happenings. Keiichi wants to find out the truth, but could it lead to his own death?When They Cry is certainly an interesting and unique anime, but that doesn't neccessarily mean it's good as well. The first four episodes work well, proceeding from low-brow humor to unsettling creepiness and horror that could have worked as a one-shot series on its own. It's genuinely scary to see these cute anime girl's irises turn into snake-like slits as they seem to be possessed by a demon or god and turn Keiichi's world upside down. If anything, those first four shows reminded me of the descent into madness style of Edgar Allan Poe. The issue I had was with Episode 5, which seems to start the show over from the point of view of Mion, one of the girls around Keiichi. Apparently, that's how this show is laid out. It tells the same tale from six different points of view. I am not a fan of this type of story at all. It seems cheap and gimmicky and allows animation and plot to be recycled endlessly. In fact it seems to me to be a benchmark of shows with low budgets or low imagination and wreaks of lazy storytelling. I put it right up there with the ""lost memory"" cliche or the ""Start at the end and flashback"" techniques. I don't know how many times I can tolerate starting over from the beginning in a 26 episode show. If the show is set up like this then each arc should be on a seperate disc. They should have put episode 5 on the next volume instead of doing a 180 at the end of Volume 1.

1062832,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B000O77M0A,trashcanman,"[3, 4]","""When They Cry"" is an anime adapted from a popular series of Japanese murder-mystery video games.  And how do video game adaptations usually fare, class?  Well, if this first volume is any indication, consider the curse shattered.  The first 5 episodes of this anime are fabulous and the story is being told in amazingly bold form.  It closely resembles bothThe Wicker ManandRosemary's Babyin tone and themes, but adds that brand of cloying cuteness that can only be found in anime which only manages to accentuate the disturbing content.  This is a series I absolutely cannot wait to see more of.  Makes me glad that there are already six volumes out.Keichi is a transfer student making friends at his new school in the village of Hinamizawa.  he's already found his way into a club of energetic girls who play games and enact embarrassing punishments on the loser. It's adorable. But the village has secrets.  Lots of 'em.  And nearly as many endearing characters to go with those buried secrets.  Each year, they hold a festival.  Each year somebody dies on that night and another disappears altogether.  Nobody talks about it.  It is simply dismissed as the curse of the village's guardian deity and those who vanish are referred to as having been ""spirited away by the demon"".  The more Keichi learns, the more frightening this anime becomes.  Who are his new friends and why have they been connected to every single victim?  ""When They Cry"" is a tale of paranoia, secrets & lies (gotta have those), mystery, and suspense so thick that a cherubic anime girl could cut with a very large cleaver. And that's just the first arc of a story that will be retold in many different ways. Hopefully, it can maintain some of the freshness and genius of this first arc.What sets this apart from any other murder-mystery I've seen is that we see the ending (one of many more to come) at the finish of the first four episodes.  After that, time is rewound and we are taken back to the beginning to see a different sequence of events and fall in love with the characters all over again in spite of knowing (part of) the horrible truth.  The cast bugged me for the first 10 minutes or so with their cutesy character designs and cliche anime mannerisms, but by the end of the first episode, I was hooked.  And it wasn't just the people clawing their own throats open.  It's the fright of seeing a typically darling girl for this medium turn into a menacing  entity for just a second before switching back to her saccharine self.  Or the way their pupils narrow cat-like into slits as they innocently (or maybe not) point out similarities between Keichi and the last student to ""transfer"" away from the school without a trace.  The first climax in episode four will drop you jaw, guaranteed.  But by the end of the very next twenty minutes, all will be forgiven and you will again be wrapped up in the sweetness of the same characters whose lives you just saw end horrifically.This is as good a first volume as I've ever seen for an anime series.  I will be gobbling up the rest as soon as i can get my hands on them.
