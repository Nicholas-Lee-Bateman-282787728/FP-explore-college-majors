Lived in Lahore, Pakistan in the mid-70s when Islamic fundamentalism was just beginning to influence the Pakistani public. Bhutto (Benazir's father) was in power. Thought the portrayal of American treatment of anyone who looked Middle Eastern, and this could be anyone from any Mediterranean country or South America, was spot-on and made me disgusted for how fellow Americans treated anyone they didn't think was like them. Totally understood lead actor's growth of beard because it reminded him of his origins and his home.

1646691,A3GUZIX0ITZORF,B00CERJIOG,applewood,"[5, 6]","Reading the plot blurb at the rental store for this movie made it sound intriguing, but when I saw it was also directed by Mira Nair, who did such good jobs on the entertaining yet emotionally deep Monsoon Wedding, Salaam Bombay! and The Namesake, I knew it would be good, but I didn't know how moving it would be, nor profound in it's deeper reminder that looks can be (and often are) deceiving.Without wanting to say too much and give away the story which keeps the suspense and drama taut and fast paced, I want to add my 2cents worth to those who say this is a great story with interesting twists and layers of realistic emotion, leading to a vision of humanity that is perhaps more optimistic than is currently warranted (in reality we'd have seen the launch of a deadly drone near the ending...). It brings up issues of Western hegemony, terrorism and national security, personal ambition and integrity (and in this way reminds me of the less nuancedSyriana), but even more universally it is the classic story of how we as individuals are all challenged by, and perhaps eventually overcome, the urge to react with anger and negativity, and get sucked into that which we are wanting to rise above. In this way it was a bit like the great short storyCeremony: (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)by Leslie Marmon Silko, yet in a completely more contemporary and emotionally seductive context.

1646696,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00CERJIOG,C. Sawin,"[9, 13]","In ""The Reluctant Fundamentalist,"" a Pakistani man named Changez (Riz Ahmed) finds himself at a crossroads. Ten years ago, he was graduating from Princeton, becoming a part of one of the most prestigious law firms in New York, and falling in love with a photographer named Erica (Kate Hudson). In the present day, Changez is back in Pakistan but is seen as a person of interest when an American citizen is kidnapped. A journalist named Bobby Lincoln (Liev Schreiber) tries to get an interview with Changez, but their environment is nothing short of chaotic warfare. Changez must make a decision; does he fight for his people and his homeland or do the right thing for the country he has grown to love?Not being familiar with director Mira Nair's previous works, the star power of ""The Reluctant Fundamentalist"" and the sheer fact that it was a thriller were the only two things to fall back on as far as tickling the short and curlies of the interest glands you find deep inside your head, brain, heart, and tender areas. Kiefer Sutherland is Jim Cross, Changez's boss and the man in charge of hiring at Underwood Samson; the law firm Changez gets hired on at. Sutherland's character doesn't mess around. He demands to be impressed and tells Changez to ""lift up the hood"" when we first set eyes on him. Sutherland's performance is very passionate as he becomes a mentor in the eyes of Changez. Liev Schreiber is Bobby Lincoln and like most journalists portrayed in film Bobby will stop at nothing to get a good story. He seems completely lost in Pakistan, but also knows what dangers lie ahead as he always carries a gun with him. Bobby just wants Changez to do the right thing. Finally there's Kate Hudson as Erica; a photographer who accidentally killed her boyfriend in a car wreck nearly six months ago. Erica loves her work and adores Changez, but also hasn't finished grieving her previous love. She's very flawed and is often extremely indecisive when it comes to important decisions.The film slowly reveals that it's a political thriller, but it also has a really interesting perspective when it comes to the 9/11 attacks. Changez mourns those who lost their lives, but at the same time feels this sense of awe that is almost like a spine-tingling rush. He says, ""It's as if David had struck Goliath."" From that point on, the thriller portrays how difficult it must have been for someone of Pakistani descent just to try and live peacefully in America without losing their minds after 9/11. Changez is put through the ringer as his days in America only seem to get worse and the ignorance portrayed by everyone around him is astounding.Riz Ahmed's performance is basically the groundwork for the rest of the film. He's very intelligent and has an extremely bright future ahead of him that all seems to change because of terrorist attacks. Ahmed portrays an extremely driven individual that is both emotional and very adamant in his beliefs. ""The Reluctant Fundamentalist"" is constantly jumping back and forth between the past and the future and almost seems like a game of verbal tug of war between Bobby and Changez as the interview progresses. The second half of the film has a few surprises up its sleeve that's equivalent to being blindfolded, being turned in a different direction, and walking a few hundred paces before being turned in another direction.""The Reluctant Fundamentalist"" probably won't be remembered by the end of the year and more than likely won't make any best of the year lists, but it's a pretty ballsy political thriller that puts a much needed different spin on the war on terrorism in film and happily piggybacks on the shoulders of Riz Ahmed who carries the film with ease.",3,Thrives on the unstable performance of Riz Ahmed,1367539200,"05 3, 2013",2013,3710,"['Reluctant', 'Fundamentalist', 'Pakistani', 'man', 'named', 'Changez', 'Riz', 'Ahmed', 'crossroads', 'Ten', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'graduating', 'Princeton', 'becoming', 'part', 'one', 'most', 'prestigious', 'law', 'firms', 'New', 'York', 'falling', 'love', 'photographer', 'named', 'Erica', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'present', 'day', 'Changez', 'back', 'Pakistan', 'seen', 'person', 'interest', 'when', 'American', 'citizen', 'kidnapped', 'journalist', 'named', 'Bobby', 'Lincoln', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'get', 'interview', 'Changez', 'environment', 'nothing', 'short', 'chaotic', 'warfare', 'Changez', 'must', 'make', 'decision', 'fight', 'people', 'homeland', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'country', 'grown', 'love', 'Not', 'being', 'familiar', 'director', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'previous', 'works', 'star', 'power', 'Reluctant', 'Fundamentalist', 'sheer', 'fact', 'was', 'thriller', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'things', 'fall', 'back', 'as', 'far', 'tickling', 'short', 'curlies', 'interest', 'find', 'deep', 'head', 'brain', 'heart', 'tender', 'areas', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'Jim', 'Cross', 'Changez', 'boss', 'man', 'charge', 'hiring', 'Underwood', 'Samson', 'law', 'firm', 'Changez', 'hired', 'Sutherland', 'character', ""n't"", 'mess', 'around', 'be', 'impressed', 'Changez', 'lift', 'up', 'hood', 'when', 'first', 'set', 'eyes', 'Sutherland', 'performance', 'very', 'passionate', 'mentor', 'eyes', 'Changez', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Bobby', 'Lincoln', 'most', 'journalists', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Bobby', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'good', 'story', 'completely', 'lost', 'Pakistan', 'also', 'what', 'lie', 'ahead', 'always', 'gun', 'Bobby', 'just', 'Changez', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'Finally', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'Erica', 'photographer', 'who', 'accidentally', 'killed', 'boyfriend', 'car', 'wreck', 'nearly', 'six', 'months', 'ago', 'Erica', 'work', 'adores', 'Changez', 'also', ""n't"", 'finished', 'grieving', 'previous', 'love', 'very', 'flawed', 'often', 'extremely', 'indecisive', 'when', 'important', 'decisions.The', 'film', 'slowly', 'political', 'thriller', 'also', 'really', 'interesting', 'perspective', 'when', '9/11', 'attacks', 'Changez', 'mourns', 'who', 'lost', 'lives', 'same', 'time', 'feels', 'sense', 'awe', 'almost', 'spine-tingling', 'rush', 'David', 'had', 'struck', 'Goliath', 'point', 'thriller', 'how', 'difficult', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'someone', 'Pakistani', 'descent', 'just', 'try', 'live', 'peacefully', 'America', 'losing', 'minds', '9/11', 'Changez', 'put', 'ringer', 'days', 'America', 'only', 'seem', 'get', 'worse', 'ignorance', 'portrayed', 'everyone', 'astounding.Riz', 'Ahmed', 'performance', 'basically', 'groundwork', 'rest', 'film', 'very', 'intelligent', 'extremely', 'bright', 'future', 'ahead', 'change', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'Ahmed', 'extremely', 'driven', 'individual', 'emotional', 'very', 'adamant', 'beliefs', 'Reluctant', 'Fundamentalist', 'constantly', 'jumping', 'back', 'forth', 'past', 'future', 'almost', 'game', 'verbal', 'tug', 'war', 'Bobby', 'Changez', 'interview', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'few', 'up', 'sleeve', 'equivalent', 'being', 'blindfolded', 'being', 'turned', 'different', 'direction', 'walking', 'few', 'hundred', 'paces', 'being', 'turned', 'direction', 'Reluctant', 'Fundamentalist', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'remembered', 'end', 'year', 'more', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'best', 'year', 'lists', 'pretty', 'ballsy', 'political', 'thriller', 'much', 'needed', 'different', 'spin', 'war', 'terrorism', 'film', 'happily', 'piggybacks', 'shoulders', 'Riz', 'Ahmed', 'who', 'film', 'ease']",The Reluctant Fundamentalist

1646701,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00CERJIOG,Grady Harp,"[24, 27]","For those who have read Mohsin Hamid's brilliant novel on which this film is  based the story will be easier to follow than the somewhat disconnected screenplay that was written by Hamid with Ami Boghani and William Wheeler.  Mira Nair directs, and knowing her previous work suggests that it is this very disconnect that she wishes to emphasize in this profoundly moving film - in these times of global unrest and fear because of terrorist acts we don't know who to trust and who to dislike, but the answer is that there is no right or wrong. Nair achieves this by beginning her film with a conversation between an American journalist Bobby (Liev Schreiber) and a Pakistani professor Changez (Riz Ahmed) in a setting of high tension in a bar in Lahore and our initial belief is that the Bobby represents the core we trust and with whom we identify, that Changez is the unknown `different culture' stranger who is suspect. In the course of the film that position is deeply altered. And that is where the power of the message is so affecting.  But we must go through flashbacks of eleven years to understand the real drama.Changez Khan (the very handsome and very fine actor Riz Ahmed) lives with his poet father Abu (Om Purl) and mother Ammi (Shabana Azmi) in Pakistan. The family is poor but educated and Changez decides to go to America to find his place in the corporate world of money and success - and help support his family (his sister is ready to marry but the family can ill afford a traditional wedding). Changez arrives in America, attends university, and rises rapidly, gaining a position with a Wall Street company that specializes in financial advising for business internationally. The head of the company Jim Cross (Kiefer Sutherland) personally picks Changez after testing his skills and sends Changez on missions to the Philippines etc where he examines the finances, cuts waste (and jobs of workers) and makes the businesses run efficiently, increase profits, but sacrificing the working class. On one such mission Changez is asked to analyze a publishing house in Istantbul, the owner  Nazmi (Haluk Bilginer) has translated Changez' fathers poetry into Turkish, and pleads with Changez not to destroy his publishing house. Cross demands Changez shut it down and Changez refuses and submits his resignation. As he prepares to pack to return, jobless, to the US he is watching television and the twin towers of 9/11 are being attacked. His attempts to return to the US are met with police and airport interrogations since he is not a native born American, and this allows the viewer to witness the horrible and demeaning treatment `foreigners' received in the wake of 9/11.Changez does return to New York and has another setback with his photographer artist girlfriend Erica (Kate Hudson), herself deeply bruised by the loss of her lover in a car crash she caused in the recent past, who has an art opening that includes videos and images of bits of conversation she has shared with Changez - information which in the exhibition further underlines the concept of Changez as a potential terrorist. Changez flees to Pakistan, becomes an anti-violence but fiery professor whose students seek to rid their Pakistan of the American intruders. And this is where the conversation at film's beginning ultimately makes sense (it is now 2011).  The manner in which the film ends is left for the viewer to experience.As in the book there are many sidebar stories and characters that underline the stories of both Bobby (who has been talked into joining the CIA) and Changez who moves from his love of the American Dream and his sweetheart, to his spiritual commitment to his Pakistan. These characters, as well as many others in this film, allow us to see there is no one way to view acts as right or wrong.

The film is based on the 2008 novel by Mohsin Hamid, and it's possible that Amy Boghani and William Wheeler's adapation moves the story a little to quickly to give full weight to the wrenching internal changes that young Changez has to make.

1646707,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00CERJIOG,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","Adapting the critically acclaimed 2007 bestseller ""The Reluctant Fundamentalist"" by Pakistani author Moshim Hamid, director Mira Nair had a number of challenges to face. The novel is a complex and challenging look at a post-9/11 world and has been pretty universally praised and even studied on college campuses. Shortlisted for the Booker Prize, it is a book that instantly connected with the zeitgeist of attempting to understand how both the terrorist acts on that fateful day and the U.S. response to them had forever changed the world in which we lived. The story is told entirely through the eyes of a young Pakistani man who embraced the American dream before ultimately feeling betrayed by it. When trying to adapt such a seminal and personal work, it is virtually impossible to satisfy everyone. When a work becomes ""important"" (for lack of a better word), any adaptation will likely be scrutinized and judged to fall short. And indeed, the critical response to ""The Reluctant Fundamentalist"" was largely tepid. While it's true that the film version lacks some of the power and potency of Hamid's treatise, I still think that it is a worthwhile endeavor for those looking for something a little more contemplative than traditional Hollywood fare.The film unfolds over a discourse between two characters in a Pakistani cafe. When an American academic is kidnapped from the local university, CIA officials think that a charismatic professor might hold necessary and timely answers. Changez (Riz Ahmed) is viewed as a rising star on the political/terrorism scene. And indeed, he seems to hold much influence over the student activists that rally around him. Into the cafe comes a journalist/operative (Liev Schrieber) sent by the CIA to get answers and find a location on the missing man. If this can't be accomplished in a peaceable manner, a full scale police invasion on the cafe seems imminent. As the men size each other up, the initial unease and mistrust abates and Changez relates the truth of his story claiming that he is not who they think he is. He tells a compelling history that begins with him pursuing an American education, becoming a wildly successful businessman, finding true love with a New York socialite (Kate Hudson) before it all comes crashing down in response to 9/11. Facing a very different world, he is forced onto an alternate course not of his own devising.""The Reluctant Fundamentalist"" is certainly a critique and commentary on post-9/11 paranoia and prejudice. It opens a discussion about what might have been handled differently, but it doesn't seek out all-encompassing answers. This is very much a personal story of one character's arc through a tumultuous time. Many of the challenges faced by Changez were real and tangible, but just as many were internally motivated as he struggled with his identity in ways he never had to consider. In my estimation, ""The Reluctant Fundamentalist"" really works as a fascinating character study. Ahmed, a rapper who played a bumbling terrorist himself in the deft ""Four Lions,"" is a revelation here. So assured, he manages to convey the difficult transitions of the film's screenplay without ever making it feel false or strained. Schrieber is reliable, as always. I did, however, think Hudson felt a little miscast but she wasn't so distracting as to take away from Ahmed's magnetic performance. Surprisingly, though, aside from Ahmed, it is Kiefer Sutherland who really stands out as the ruthless New York businessman who guides Ahmed to success. The scenes between the two are incredibly insightful about the way of the world. In the end, ""The Reluctant Fundamentalist"" wasn't as shattering or as emotional as it might have been, but it was thoughtful and incredibly well done. Certainly worth a look!

1646710,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00CERJIOG,Paul Allaer,"[6, 10]","""The Reluctant Fundamentalist"" (2013 release; 128 min.) brings the story of Changez (played by Riz Ahmed), a brilliant minded Pakistani who sought (and achieved) success on Wall Street, but now apparently is embroiled in a kidnapping scheme of a US professor teaching at Lahore University. As the movie opens, we see the kidnapping taking place, and a US reporter (played by Liev Schreiber) tries to figure out what really happened. He is eventually linked up with Changez, who promises to tell him ""the whole story"" if he is prepared to hear him out. The reporter agrees, and from that moment on Changez retells his story, going back 10+ years from his days at Princeton where he excelled both in academics and in soccer. Changez charms a Wall Street-type (played by Keifer Sutherland) and hence lands a job at a prestigious Wall Street firm. There he also climbs the ranks quickly, and along the way gets to meet (and fall in love with) Erica (played by Kate Hudson). In September, 2011, Changez and several colleagues visit the Philippines on a business trip, and while there 9/11 takes place, much to the horror of Changez and his colleagues. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, the movie is quite critical of the US, despite the repeated claims of Changez that he is ""a lover of the United States"". Mostly, the post-9/11 days, featuring racial profiling, are played up to the max. I found it frankly unbelievable when Changez and his colleagues return from the Philippines that Changez would be picked up as they are walking in the airport even before they get to US immigration and right in front of the Changez' boss (a top man on Wall Street). I am not suggesting that racial profiling did not happen post-9/11, but am suggesting that the portrayal of it in the movie feels unauthentic. Second, you only need to see who financed the movie (Doha Film Institute) as a possible explanation of the overall tone of the movie. Third, the title of the movie is quite misleading as the Changez character, deeply flawed as it is, is frankly neither reluctant nor, in my opinion, fundamentalist (but judge for yourself). Fourth, Kate Hudson fans alert! After umpteen recent and forgettable rom-com movie roles (""Bride Wars"", etc.), Hudson finally plays a more dramataic character, and reminds us how good she can really be. Fifth, Indigo Girls fans alert! Amy Ray plays a short cameo as herself, bringing a solo song (""Measure of Me"") as Changez and Erica meet up in a bar. In fact the soundtrack of the movie is done very nicely (check out also Peter Gabriel's ""Bol"" playing over the closing credits). Last but not least, the movie was shot on location in a bunch of places (including Pakistan, India, Turkey, New York), which really adds to the movie.I have quite ambivalent feelings about this movie. The movie flew by in no time, so it is not lacking in entertainment value. But when I started reflecting about what I had just seen, the shortcomings of the movie became more apparent to me. The screening where I saw this at (E Street Landmark Theatre in Washington, DC) was very well attended, which I found encouraging.

1646711,A3D28SE0H060MU,B00CERJIOG,Ryan,"[0, 3]","[...]As engaging as the premise for The Reluctant Fundamentalist is, I am afraid it was made just a little too late for American audiences to care. There was a wave of post-9/11 dramas dealing with the aftermath of the tragic terrorist attacks, and The Reluctant Fundamentalist would have been a spectacular follow-up to those films, but instead comes when audiences seem to be straying further from this dark period of recent American history. That being said, director Mira Nair is able to breathe as much life as the narrative can hold with energetic filmmaking.Adapted from the novel by Mohsin Hamid, The Reluctant Fundamentalist tells the story of a Pakistani professor who the CIA suspects of involvement in the kidnapping of an American academic. A reporter (Liev Schreiber) is sent to interview Professor Changez (Riz Ahmed) in order to determine his involvement, and much of the film is flashbacks as the Pakistani man explains his journey to the American reporter.There is a tense aspect in the storyline dealing with the mystery of Changez' involvement in the kidnapping and the reporter's ability to escape unharmed, but much of the movie deals with much more personal elements. We are told through flashbacks of the young ambitious journey Changez took to the United States, studying and eventually acquiring a desired career on Wall Street before the attacks on the United States made the entire world seem harsher. We watch as the city turns against Changez because of the way he looks, and the way that it turns him into a bitter person. The main focus for this alteration in his personality is shown through the devastation of two significant relationships; the one he has with an American artist (Kate Hudson) who uses him as the inspiration for her artwork, and his boss and mentor (Kiefer Sutherland).At times The Reluctant Fundamentalist is altogether engaging, though the pieces of the film don't all seem to come together fluidly. It ends up feeling like a series of vignettes involving the same person, but some of the variation in the film's mood shift too much for one film to contain. It attempts to be a drama, but at times has aspirations to be a thriller. These sequences aren't bad, but don't feel as though they belong in the same film as the rest.FOR THE REST OF THE REVIEW AND MORE VISIT [...][...]",3,REAL MOVIE NEWS REVIEW,1379030400,"09 13, 2013",2013,2332,"['[', 'As', 'engaging', 'premise', 'Reluctant', 'Fundamentalist', 'am', 'afraid', 'was', 'made', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'American', 'audiences', 'care', 'was', 'wave', 'post-9/11', 'dramas', 'dealing', 'aftermath', 'tragic', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'Reluctant', 'Fundamentalist', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'spectacular', 'follow-up', 'films', 'instead', 'when', 'audiences', 'seem', 'be', 'straying', 'further', 'dark', 'period', 'recent', 'American', 'history', 'being', 'said', 'director', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'able', 'breathe', 'as', 'much', 'life', 'narrative', 'can', 'hold', 'energetic', 'filmmaking.Adapted', 'novel', 'Mohsin', 'Hamid', 'Reluctant', 'Fundamentalist', 'story', 'Pakistani', 'professor', 'who', 'CIA', 'suspects', 'involvement', 'kidnapping', 'American', 'academic', 'reporter', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'sent', 'interview', 'Professor', 'Changez', 'Riz', 'Ahmed', 'order', 'determine', 'involvement', 'much', 'film', 'flashbacks', 'Pakistani', 'man', 'journey', 'American', 'reporter.There', 'tense', 'aspect', 'storyline', 'dealing', 'mystery', 'Changez', 'involvement', 'kidnapping', 'reporter', 'ability', 'escape', 'unharmed', 'much', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'personal', 'elements', 'are', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'young', 'ambitious', 'journey', 'Changez', 'took', 'United', 'States', 'studying', 'eventually', 'acquiring', 'desired', 'career', 'Wall', 'Street', 'attacks', 'United', 'States', 'made', 'entire', 'world', 'seem', 'harsher', 'watch', 'city', 'Changez', 'way', 'way', 'bitter', 'person', 'main', 'focus', 'alteration', 'personality', 'shown', 'devastation', 'two', 'significant', 'relationships', 'one', 'American', 'artist', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'who', 'inspiration', 'artwork', 'boss', 'mentor', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', '.At', 'Reluctant', 'Fundamentalist', 'altogether', 'engaging', 'pieces', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'all', 'seem', 'come', 'together', 'fluidly', 'up', 'feeling', 'series', 'vignettes', 'involving', 'same', 'person', 'variation', 'film', 'mood', 'shift', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'film', 'contain', 'be', 'drama', 'times', 'aspirations', 'be', 'thriller', 'sequences', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'belong', 'same', 'film', 'rest.FOR', 'THE', 'REST', 'THE', 'REVIEW', 'AND', 'MORE', 'VISIT', '[', ']', '[', ']']",The Reluctant Fundamentalist

We are then carted back to 2001 to explain how we got to be in a tea house in Pakistan discussing the kidnapping of a US citizen and lecturer. In 2001 Changez managed to land a job with top American consultant firm Underwood Samson. They are the people that turn up and make a company more efficient, mainly by re shaping personnel or `sacking' as we used to call it. He is spotted by corporate nasty played by Kiefer Sutherland.Then September 11th happens and it is a game changer he also grows a beard which seems to attract way too much attention from the authorities even if it is a bit unkempt. So he returns to Pakistan having had his ambition singed by his overseas experiences, once at home he starts to mix with people who are much closer to their religion than him and have a whole different way of thinking. What follows is a story of intrigue and religion and a mighty clash of cultures in all senses.This is a quietly intense film that is often full of suspense, the acting is all excellent. Bobby Lincoln is played by Liev Schreiber (`X-Men Origins' and `Defiance') and he is ruddy excellent. We also have an appearance from Indian screen legend Om Puri which was a nice touch.This has good production values and nice attention to detail; and even at 130 minutes did not out stay its welcome. It is always hard to deal in a balanced way with such thorny issues as `fundamentalism' or `radicalisation' but I think director Mira Nair has done a very good job. This was an adaptation of the book by Moshin Hamad who also co wrote the screen play so they have tried to capture the spirit of the book and succeeded to a large extent.
