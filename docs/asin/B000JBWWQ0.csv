He contemplates creation, evolution,then JUST HAPPENS to get an invite to discover ""nine insights"" dug up in Peru.John goes to Peru, finding a multicultural commune cultivating the land and contemplating their shrubbery. As Julia (Annabeth Gish) advises John, ""Take in the plant."" He also falls in love with Marjorie,only to learn he's been stealing her aura. Auras are a major motif. Whenever John ""opens up"",everything becomes psychedelic,a flamboyantly colored LSD experience. What a long,strange trip indeed. In the meantime, the Church (embodied in Hector Elizondo as Cardinal Sebastian) and the State are conspiring against the pastoral idyll. They want the insights suppressed--though there are good rebel priests like Fr. Sanchez and Fr. Jose. There's also the evil military man Jensen,an unrecognizable Jurgen Prochnow.""Celestine Prophecy"" is a New Agey Indiana Jones movie. There are plenty of fight scenes and explosions. Along the way,it gets pedantic. At times, it's hilariously heavy-handed. It ends with the Nine Insights scrolling down the screen as Peruvian panpipe and Gregorian chant play.

Upon arrival he finds romance, adventure and a new way of perceiving reality based on 9 mystical insights that may bring to fruition the next step in mankind's spiritual evolution.Based on the best selling novel by James Redfield, `The Celestine Prophecy' ('05) is an engaging film with some of the most beautiful scenic cinematography I've seen in quite some time. I was also impressed by the cast which delivers strong, heartfelt performances, doing their utmost best to provide an enjoyable evening of entertainment along with their spiritual message.Be forewarned, this film is first and foremost an instructional tool for New Age teachings on the nature of spirituality and the method of reconnecting with divine energy.

The WIKI contains a good summary of the book: [...] .The movie features good performances in supporting roles, like Hector Elizondo as a cardinal, and Juergen Prochnow as the bad guy. Of course, for Juergen with his pock scars it's easy to play the bad guy :-). Matthew Settle and Thomas Kretschmann are giving okay performances as the main actors. Overall, the acting is decent, though at times the film looks a little like a made-for-TV show. For example, I didn't believe the Marjorie character how she played overly ""hard to get"".Somehow, the mixture of New Age content with action movie did not work that well for me. I liked the ideas it brings up, for example how the more advanced characters experience glimpses of clairvoyance or that they can see human auras and energy patterns, and how they are guided by spirits (of some of the characters that didn't make it on Earth to the end of the movie). At the center of the story, nine ancient scrolls containing nine ""insights"" forecast the advent of a better time, which could be supported in reality by more and more people becoming more spiritual. The insights themselves, presented in shortened form at the epilog, sounded much alike to me, maybe they could have been compressed into three :-)The action part comes from the bad guy influencing the military in Peru (that's where the scrolls were found and the majority of the film happens) trying to seize the scrolls (especially the ninth one) at all cost. Who actually is behind the bad guy is not made clear. Early on the Catholic church seems supporting him, only in the end its representative (the cardinal) breaks away and eventually protects all surviving scroll supporters from death by military.Overall I have mixed feelings about this movie.

When we find the true `God Experience', the fight over whose religion is best--it fades. There's just one truth."" - From the movieA New York Times best-selling book published in 1993, The Celestine Prophecy by James Redfield has sold 14 million copies and has been translated in over 45 languages. Written in novel form, The Celestine Prophecy describes the synchronistic adventures of John Woodson as he travels to Peru to find out more about an ancient prophecy that describes modern life in startling detail--as well as the future evolutionary path of humanity. While there, he meets up with Father Jose, guardian of the scrolls, as well as others who are dedicated to disseminating the transformative nine Insights found in the Celestine Prophecy.Redfield had wanted to make a movie version of The Celestine Prophecy, but despite offers from several big studios, the timing didn't feel right. In the spirit of the book, which advocates following intuition and gut hunches towards a more aware, purposeful life, Redfield waited--and now the time has come for the film to be birthed into the world.After seeing the Indigo movie debacle and the mediocre acting in What the Bleep Do We Know!?, I admit that I didn't hold much hope for the movie version of The Celestine Prophecy. However, after watching the film and its special features last night, I was surprised and delighted at the results.The Celestine Prophecy was one of the first ""New Age"" books I read while in the process of coming out of organized religion as both an adherent and a minister. It's been years since I read it, but I remembered that the prose was a bit clunky and didactic, but the information on synchronicity, auras, and control dramas were spiritual gold. I was especially impressed with the types of relationship control dramas humans use to ""steal"" energy until they learn to tap into their own internal reservoir.Because the novel was heavily instructional (as I recall), I figured that the movie would be more ""telling"" than ""showing""--one of the biggest mistakes a writer can make. Yet, Redfield's screenplay was utterly elegant--translating the nine Insights into a compelling demonstration that both the characters and audience experience for themselves. For example, instead of explaining the types of control dramas, one scene shows John trying to coerce Marjorie into getting together with him. Through seamless special effects, we see his red aura extending and then encroaching upon Marjorie's shrinking blue aura. John is new to the world of energy, and through interactions with Father Sanchez, Wil, Julia and the other characters, he learns what it means to generate energy for himself through openness and awareness.Another example of ""showing"" instead of telling occurs when the characters vibrate to such a level that they become invisible. Rather than explain to the viewers about vibration (in fact, I don't even think the word ""vibration"" is used in the movie!), we are shown how focused intent and awareness made them invisible to the violent Peruvian rebels and corrupt law enforcement agents.The beautiful musical score supported gorgeous cinematography and first-rate acting. Next to the screenplay, perhaps this was the most surprising of all: the convincing performances by a fine set of actors. Annabeth Gish, resembling a young Sigourney Weaver, looked so familiar to me--and then my husband pointed out that we had just seen her in the holiday TV movie Candles on Bay Street. The actors who played Father Sanchez, Wil, and Jensen were especially compelling, and while watching the performance of Sarah Wayne Callies, I had the thought ""Boy, she would have been a much better Lois Lane than Kate Bosworth in Superman Returns.""Perhaps one reason these actors were so amazing was because Redfield wanted, specifically, actors that were on a spiritual path that would ""get"" the gist of The Celestine Prophecy movie. (Needless to say, Hollywood would have royally botched this movie.) One by one, the players came to HIM, as we find out in the special features. Especially intriguing was how actor Thomas Kretschmann, who plays Wil, relied on intuition and hunches to escape East Germany as a youth. He felt to talk to someone on the street and this person happened to be a central cog in the underground railroad that smuggled individuals across the Iron Curtain into the West. Because Kretschmann ""lives"" by following intuition, his character was even more believable. In fact, in less deft hands, Wil could have come across as superior and preachy--but this fine actor portrays his character as humble, wise, and laissez faire.On a personal note, I had three synchronistic events happen to me concerning The Celestine Prophecy movie:1. A few days ago, I received in the mail The Intention Experiment by Lynne McTaggart. Unaware of the book, I hadn't even requested a copy from the publisher. Yet, somehow, someone in the publicity department of a major publisher had my name and address--and sent me the book. I'm four chapters into this book and it's extraordinary: if you're scientifically minded and want ""proof"" for the Insights that Redfield writes about--especially the reality of energy, light, and consciousness in living organisms--you MUST get this book.2. While watching the special features of this film, Redfield mentions that Barnet Baine produced the movie What Dreams May Come. I received only one DVD for Christmas (from my husband), and guess what it was?3. Last night, I was taking a bath and was debating on watching The Celestine Prophecy (I had the film for a week, but couldn't bring myself to watch it just yet). I opened up my copy of New Age Retailer that I received in the mail that day, and guess what I turned to? A full-page ad for The Celestine Prophecy movie!Several of the inspiring truths found in this movie include:* Follow hunches!* Instead of taking energy, give it.* We are helped--we are not alone.* Wonderment can be restored--and curious, fearless living opens unexpected doors.* Powerful change is coming in the world--and the shift has already begun.* ""The guidance within evolves the world towards a heaven that is already here. To know this is to know our destiny.""In addition to serving as a wonderful reminder for those familiar with the book, The Celestine Prophecy movie provides a gentle, intriguing introduction to those unfamiliar with the subtle world of energy, ""coincidences"", and power/control. Bravo, Redfield and company, for doing such a fine job on this film!(Note: This DVD includes both Widescreen and Full Screen versions and includes The Making of the Celestine Prophecy--interviews with Redfield, the actors, producers, etc. The movie is about 90 minutes long and is rated PG for violence. In my opinion, the violence/shooting is closer to PG-13, so you may want to watch it first before introducing it to young children.)Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the

1025514,A25JH6CO4DVINS,B000JBWWQ0,Junglies,"[17, 58]","I had no prior knowledge of the book upon which this film was based before I watched it yesterday. Throughout the course of the movie we are inducted into the insights of the philosophy which underpins the celestine prophecy until at the conclusion we are shown what the implications of that philosophy are.This is very much a ""got to get ourselves back to the garden"" type of movie with homespun philosophy stitched together as a sort of coherent whole. AS Karl Popper said, a theory that explains everything, explains nothing. The implication being that any theory must be tested and tested to reute it otherwise it cannot satisfactorily explain anything.Rather like chinese food, this movie makes you feel like you have not eaten anything by the time you have reached the end. It is constructed, much as the New Age group of philosophies of which this is purported to be one, out of a series of generalised platitudes of which themselves are meaningless. For example one insight is that of coincidences. Given the number of people on the planet, coincidences must be a part of life by any reckoning, so imposing a construct upon them is rather meaningless.Much of the movie requires an article of faith to carry it forward. It essentially depends on our aquiescence in order to proceed. Questions of the origin of the so-called scrolls, which it seems can be reinterpreted by only a chosen few, at different times, to reveal different answers to the same questions are ignored. Rather like the fable of the origin of the ark in the mormon faith, these scrolls are given the role of established, unquestionable facts which must only be accepted as an article of faith and cannot be challenged.Similarly, only the initiated are able to divine the truths of the scrolls through the contact of others of the chosen few. There seems to be very few disciples who can go forth and preach the gospel to the initiated. And, of course the whole gamut of opposition to the exposure of the scrolls must include the military alongside the representatives of the established churches who envision the rise of the prophecy as a threat to their power and wealth.I find much of the film to be dissatisfying for a number of different reasons. As someonewho who does not believe in a deity of any description it is hard to acknowledge such a tale given the centrality of a god like being to it's development. Secondly, the idea of a heaven on earth must be attractive to environmentalists and new agers alike who seem to believe that we can go back to a sort of merrie old englande society where production is for necessity not for greed but alas that who'll premise ignores much working class histories which clearly show the nasty, brutish and short type of existance that most people had then. Technology is in many ways a curse, but in general it has brought with it a better quality of life for the majority.In the main though, I find this movie to be trite and superficial.

1025516,A3FY3H6F4249E0,B000JBWWQ0,Kathy W,"[4, 5]","This DVD is based on the best-selling book ""The Celestine Prophecy"".  It is full of fine actors, many of which you will probably recognize, even if you don't know their names. The story is a fictitious adventure, taking place mainly in Peru.  Our hero, John, runs into an old friend, who tells him about information that sets him off on an interesting adventure to find 9 ancient scrolls from 500 or 600 BC, called ""Insights"".  The Insights redefine they way people can choose to look at life and interact with each other.  The problem is, church officials in Peru don't want the information in the Insights to become available to people.  The church and the military are intent on destroying the scrolls, and are willing to jail, or even kill, anyone who tries to interfere.  As John goes to Peru, he meets many people who each teach him something about the Insights, in their proper order. It displays the concept ""when the student is ready, the teacher will appear"".  (Many people believe there are no coincidences, but instead there is a divine order, which often occurs to achieve something.)  The video is done well and the journey is full of adventure, although the book is even better. There's some great scenery, too.If you know anything about energy in the spiritual sense, the Insights teach about energy fields surrounding people, places, and things.  They show the auras (energy fields) surrounding people, show you the concept of seeing colors in the aura (each color has meaning, as does the intensity of the color), and the concept of people ""stealing"" energy from other people (like when someone leaves you and you feel physically drained), and people exchanging energies from their heart charka (energy point area near the heart).  They show you energy life in plants.  They show you about seeing beyond what your physical eyes see.  Another concept is that there is plenty of energy to share.  No one needs to control others and steal energy.  As a spiritual student of Reiki, I am pleased with the spiritual energy concepts portrayed in this DVD.  I think it could have been a little longer, with more info, but it is certainly worth watching, especially if you have knowledge of the spiritual energy that I'm speaking of.  If not, can you open your mind to the possibility?  Remember, we all have these big brains that we only use a very small percentage of.  Wonder what the rest is for??? H-m-m-m-m.Personally, I would advise you to read the book ""The Celestine Prophecy"" first, and then watch the movie.  The book is really hard to put down.  (Later on, you might want to read the other books that follow.)  The DVD is great, but the book gives more info.  My 33 year old son watched this DVD and LOVED it.  He knows only what I've told him about spiritual energy.  He does not believe anything until he sees it, so he doesn't believe any of this energy stuff, but still loved the movie.  (If you want to know more about auras and colors in the aura, there are plenty of books out there.  Check out books by Ted Andrews and also there is a aura color book written by Edgar Cayce.)",5,Spiritual Energy,1170115200,"01 30, 2007",2007,3104,"['DVD', 'based', 'best-selling', 'book', 'Celestine', 'Prophecy', 'full', 'fine', 'actors', 'many', 'will', 'probably', 'recognize', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'names', 'story', 'fictitious', 'adventure', 'taking', 'place', 'mainly', 'Peru', 'hero', 'John', 'old', 'friend', 'who', 'information', 'off', 'interesting', 'adventure', 'find', '9', 'ancient', 'scrolls', '500', '600', 'BC', 'called', 'Insights', 'Insights', 'redefine', 'way', 'people', 'can', 'choose', 'look', 'life', 'interact', 'other', 'problem', 'church', 'officials', 'Peru', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'information', 'Insights', 'become', 'available', 'people', 'church', 'military', 'are', 'intent', 'destroying', 'scrolls', 'are', 'willing', 'jail', 'even', 'kill', 'anyone', 'who', 'interfere', 'John', 'Peru', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'teach', 'something', 'Insights', 'proper', 'order', 'concept', 'when', 'student', 'ready', 'teacher', 'will', 'appear', 'Many', 'people', 'believe', 'are', 'coincidences', 'instead', 'divine', 'order', 'often', 'achieve', 'something', 'video', 'done', 'well', 'journey', 'full', 'adventure', 'book', 'even', 'better', 'great', 'scenery', 'too.If', 'know', 'anything', 'energy', 'spiritual', 'sense', 'Insights', 'teach', 'energy', 'fields', 'surrounding', 'people', 'places', 'things', 'show', 'auras', 'energy', 'fields', 'surrounding', 'people', 'show', 'concept', 'seeing', 'colors', 'aura', 'color', 'meaning', 'intensity', 'color', 'concept', 'people', 'stealing', 'energy', 'other', 'people', 'when', 'someone', 'feel', 'physically', 'drained', 'people', 'exchanging', 'energies', 'heart', 'charka', 'energy', 'point', 'area', 'heart', 'show', 'energy', 'life', 'plants', 'show', 'seeing', 'what', 'physical', 'eyes', 'see', 'concept', 'plenty', 'energy', 'share', 'one', 'control', 'others', 'steal', 'energy', 'spiritual', 'student', 'Reiki', 'am', 'pleased', 'spiritual', 'energy', 'concepts', 'portrayed', 'DVD', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'longer', 'more', 'info', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching', 'especially', 'have', 'knowledge', 'spiritual', 'energy', ""'m"", 'speaking', 'not', 'can', 'open', 'mind', 'possibility', 'Remember', 'have', 'big', 'brains', 'only', 'use', 'very', 'small', 'percentage', 'Wonder', 'what', 'rest', 'H-m-m-m-m.Personally', 'would', 'advise', 'read', 'book', 'Celestine', 'Prophecy', 'first', 'then', 'watch', 'movie', 'book', 'really', 'hard', 'put', 'down', 'Later', 'might', 'want', 'read', 'other', 'books', 'follow', 'DVD', 'great', 'book', 'more', 'info', '33', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'watched', 'DVD', 'LOVED', 'only', 'what', ""'ve"", 'told', 'spiritual', 'energy', 'not', 'believe', 'anything', 'so', ""n't"", 'believe', 'energy', 'stuff', 'still', 'loved', 'movie', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'auras', 'colors', 'aura', 'are', 'plenty', 'books', 'there', 'Check', 'out', 'books', 'Ted', 'Andrews', 'also', 'aura', 'color', 'book', 'written', 'Edgar', 'Cayce']",N/A

1025526,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B000JBWWQ0,Nicholas Carroll,"[9, 11]","I have waited 12 years for this film to be made, ever since I first read the novel in 1994. While I love the ideas of the novel(s) and have seen evidence of how synchronicity and coincidences have played out in my life, the writing style left a lot to be desired. It was elementary at best. I've always felt that ""The Celestine Prophecy"" would work much better as a film, giving us visuals of the various energies that surround us.Writer James Redfield probably followed his internal hunches in not selling his novel to major Hollywood studios, knowing how well they can mess up a movie of this kind of spiritual importance. However, after I had watched this film, a part of me wondered if having a major Hollywood studio finance the film with a talented director might have made this a much better film. As is, it is fairly good, but not out of the ballpark great. I don't know what exactly it's missing, but something is not quite right for me. Perhaps it's a bit too talky and not enough action, with the final plot resolution coming a bit too quickly and unrealistically. The explosion scene came off a bit too cheesy.All that aside, because I am hungry for more films of spiritual content to be made, I support all the film projects coming out that are based on spiritual books I've read or heard about. Along with this film, I saw ""Peaceful Warrior"" (the best of the bunch), ""Conversations With God"" (not as good as ""Celestine Prophecy""), and I even include ""The Da Vinci Code"" in this category of spiritual films, as we are supposedly in the age of ""the apocalypse"" in which information once hidden by power-elites in churches and governments is being unveiled for all to see, know and understand. If anyone wonders why the sudden increase in spiritual films, well, Nostradamus himself foresaw the 21st Century as the age of spiritual awakening.The central idea of ""The Celestine Prophecy"" is one that is sure to rile up all those fundamentalist Christians who put bumper stickers on their cars claiming that they will be ""raptured"" when the time comes. According to the ideas in ""The Celestine Prophecy"", the ""rapture"" has little to do with being obedient to church doctrine and/or leaders, but is an active process of one's spiritual development. I've had moments of pure bliss in the past, with such intensity that I thought my body would explode from the power of the spiritual love I felt. However, it is very exhausting to sustain that level of energy, especially if surrounded by the negative energy of others. The scene in this film perfectly demonstrates where that level of energy will take human beings. So, to all the fundamentalists who think obedience leads to rapture, spirituality is not for lazy people waiting around for a messiah to come. And one can't ""rapture"" one's body if one is too busy hating other people and trying to convert them to right-wing religions. Only by seeing the connections between human beings, paying attention to the synchronistic flow in one's life, and following those hunches to where they lead...only then can one begin to realize the depth of authentic spirituality.So, despite the film's flaws of being independently financed with at times flat acting and cheesy special effects, it is a worthy accomplishment and a film we need to support...especially if we hope to see the sequels ""The Tenth Insight"" and ""The Secret of Shambhala"" made into films.

While The Celestine Prophecy is filled with a warm energy, there are moments of adventure that add an exciting edge. The lush scenic vistas of Peru are at times digitally enhanced to produce a visual paradise.When the characters approach life from a different perspective everything seems more beautiful. The basic conflict in the movie is more a war of ideas and one group wants to reveal the knowledge, while another group seeks to keep the mystery hidden from the world.If you have been wondering about the meaningful coincidences in your own life, then this gives insight into what is actually occurring. If you have any interest in how energy plays a role in your life or you have considered the possibility of life being much more than our daily physical reality, then this has much to offer. Although I'm not convinced heaven and earth are the same place, but I am convinced the world could be more heavenly if people showed more love. Much of this movie can be a reality, but a few scenes delve into a fantasy element that seems more mythological, yet entertaining.This may also intrigue you if you have felt like you have met someone before in a past life or if you have felt how people give you energy and make you radiate or take your energy and make you feel sad. The idea of being ""open"" is also briefly explained, but it can take years to experience a taste of this idea and in the movie the main characters have an almost spontaneous awakening.I did find it a little unnerving that I was looking up books about auras just before I watched this movie. I had no idea there would be visualizations of auras and recently read about how they change according to mood (there are cameras that can take pictures and they change colors - it just looks like energy floating around you - some books teach you how to see them and I've had a glimpse on occassion).From a spiritual perspective this movie is a beautiful explanation of how love can change the world and from a visual perspective the entire movie is an exciting journey into gorgeous mountainous regions, ancient ruins and unveilings of the invisible. The actors all seem to be on a similar energetic plane, in that the physical world seems less relevant and they seem to have an almost higher spiritual purpose. To me that made the movie more enjoyable, although some may see the acting from a different perspective.I think this movie will appeal to people of many religions because the spiritual path people take to openness/awakening/enlightenment seems to have common elements. While watching the movie, you may discover that this mysterious ""Celestine Prophecy"" is already coming true in the lives of people you know or in your own life.~The Rebecca Review",5,Spiritual Fantasy & Reality,1169424000,"01 22, 2007",2007,2836,"['When', 'John', 'Woodsen', 'laid', 'off', 'job', 'thrown', 'world', 'synchronicity', 'danger', 'intrigue', 'Celestine', 'Prophecy', 'filled', 'warm', 'energy', 'are', 'moments', 'adventure', 'exciting', 'edge', 'lush', 'scenic', 'vistas', 'Peru', 'are', 'times', 'digitally', 'enhanced', 'produce', 'visual', 'paradise.When', 'characters', 'approach', 'life', 'different', 'perspective', 'everything', 'more', 'beautiful', 'basic', 'conflict', 'movie', 'more', 'war', 'ideas', 'one', 'group', 'reveal', 'knowledge', 'group', 'keep', 'mystery', 'hidden', 'world.If', 'have', 'been', 'wondering', 'meaningful', 'coincidences', 'own', 'life', 'then', 'insight', 'what', 'actually', 'occurring', 'have', 'interest', 'how', 'energy', 'role', 'life', 'have', 'considered', 'possibility', 'life', 'being', 'much', 'more', 'daily', 'physical', 'reality', 'then', 'much', 'offer', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', 'heaven', 'earth', 'are', 'same', 'place', 'am', 'convinced', 'world', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'heavenly', 'people', 'showed', 'more', 'love', 'Much', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'reality', 'few', 'scenes', 'delve', 'fantasy', 'element', 'more', 'mythological', 'yet', 'entertaining.This', 'may', 'also', 'intrigue', 'have', 'felt', 'have', 'met', 'someone', 'past', 'life', 'have', 'felt', 'how', 'people', 'give', 'energy', 'make', 'radiate', 'take', 'energy', 'make', 'feel', 'sad', 'idea', 'being', 'open', 'also', 'briefly', 'explained', 'can', 'take', 'years', 'experience', 'taste', 'idea', 'movie', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'almost', 'spontaneous', 'awakening.I', 'did', 'find', 'little', 'unnerving', 'was', 'looking', 'up', 'books', 'auras', 'just', 'watched', 'movie', 'had', 'idea', 'there', 'would', 'be', 'visualizations', 'auras', 'recently', 'read', 'how', 'change', 'according', 'mood', 'are', 'cameras', 'can', 'take', 'pictures', 'change', 'colors', 'just', 'energy', 'floating', 'books', 'teach', 'how', 'see', ""'ve"", 'had', 'glimpse', 'occassion', 'spiritual', 'perspective', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'explanation', 'how', 'love', 'can', 'change', 'world', 'visual', 'perspective', 'entire', 'movie', 'exciting', 'journey', 'gorgeous', 'mountainous', 'regions', 'ancient', 'ruins', 'unveilings', 'invisible', 'actors', 'seem', 'be', 'similar', 'energetic', 'plane', 'physical', 'world', 'less', 'relevant', 'seem', 'have', 'almost', 'higher', 'spiritual', 'purpose', 'made', 'movie', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'may', 'see', 'acting', 'different', 'perspective.I', 'think', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'people', 'many', 'religions', 'spiritual', 'path', 'people', 'take', 'openness/awakening/enlightenment', 'have', 'common', 'elements', 'watching', 'movie', 'may', 'discover', 'mysterious', 'Celestine', 'Prophecy', 'already', 'coming', 'true', 'lives', 'people', 'know', 'own', 'life.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A

1025537,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B000JBWWQ0,Wayne C. Rogers,"[54, 64]","The Celestine Prophecy by James Redfield started off in book format back around 1992/1993.  It was a self-published novel with an action background that dealt with certain insights into spirituality.  These insights weren't new, but Mr. Redfield did use an intriguing method for bringing them together and presenting them to the reading public.  To sell the book, Mr. Redfield drove all over the United States, getting the small, self-help bookstores to carry his novel.  A store that I'd worked at was one of the places that began to carry The Celestine Prophecy.  Gradually, through word of mouth, the novel began to sell.  Eventually, Warner Books picked up the novel and did some major publicity, and the book became an international bestseller.  This was around 1994.  Because the book gained such popularity, the big Hollywood studios attempted to purchase the film rights to The Celestine Prophecy, but Mr. Redfield wouldn't sell them.  He didn't want to take the chance of Hollywood ruining the movie, plus he wanted to have some control over the situation.  What happened is that he waited and waited and waited until he felt the time was right to make the movie.  Then, he enlisted the aid of Barnet Bain, who'd produced What Dreams May Come and Somewhere in Time.  They got a cast of relatively unknown actors to play many of the central roles with backup from a few strong character actors such as Hector Elizondo (Pretty Woman), Jurgen Prochnow (Body of Evidence) and Joaqum De Almeda (A Clear and Present Danger).  The director of the movie was Amando Mastroanni, who is someone that I'm not familiar with.  James Redfield and his wife, Salle, assumed the roles of Executive Producer and Producer and Screenwriter.  In trying to stay true to his novel and to maintain control of the film, Mr. Redfield made a movie that probably won't be seen by very many people.  Unlike the book, I don't think favorable word of mouth is going to spread about this film.  Though not a bad movie, it isn't one that you want to immediately see again.  You also don't walk away from it feeling as thought you've just discovered a major insight (pun intended) about life and the way to live it.  This movie was a disappointment to me because I enjoyed the novel so much and wanted to be moved by the film.  I wanted to come away from it, feeling alive and full of hope for the future.  It just didn't happen for me.  True, there's a wonderful message within the movie about synchronicity, how everything is made up of the same energy and how we're all interconnected, the power of love, and the evolution of man to a higher form of consciousness; yet, it could've been presented more clearly and in a more entertaining format.The movie deals with John Woodson (played by Mathew Settle), who has just been laid off from his teaching position.  He meets an old friend, who tells him about these mysterious scrolls that have just been found in Peru.  The scrolls are supposed to offer a revelation for mankind on how to live one's life.  John's friend encourages him to fly down to Peru and to check it out.  When John arrives there, he suddenly discovers to his dismay that both the Catholic Church and the Peruvian Government are trying to suppress the information that's in the scrolls out of fear that society's traditions might break down.  Through a set of coincidences, the right people immediately come into John's life, sending him on a journey through the jungles of Peru in search of the scrolls and the fabled Ninth Insight.  People are being killed left and right in a futile effort to squelch the information in the scrolls, but John finds himself unable to turn back in the face of danger.  He's compelled to keep going until he finally has the answers to what The Celestine Prophecy actually is.What this film reminded me of in many ways is a made-for-television movie.  I don't think it was ever theatrically released, but rather went straight to video (or DVD in this case).  Though the young actors try hard to breathe life into their characters, it simply doesn't work for the most part.  In other words, you never find yourself immersed within the movie, identifying with the characters and their struggles.  The directing could've been better, not to mention the special affects.  Not a lot of money was put into the special affects, and it shows.  I think Mr. Redfield inadvertently ended up with the kind of movie that he was afraid the big studios would make.  In hindsight, it probably would've been better if a major studio had tackled the novel and invested a large chunk of money into it and had hired a polished director who could have brought the movie to life in a way that would've attracted people into the theater to see it.  True, Hollywood often does a terrible adaptation of a successful novel, but occasionally Hollywood gets it right, too.  It would've been great if Kevin Costner, or Tom Hanks, could have played the role of John Woodson and Frank Darabont could've directed it.
