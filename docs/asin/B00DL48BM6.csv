Many scenes looked like my father's war photos from that time period. There was also a bit of the feel of film of the late forties. The brilliant acting team sealed it. Bill Murray is great. George Clooney seems to be our new Clark Gable. I think that Those who depicted Nazis were very effective. A very well designed film. I viewed in 4K and am glad that I made that investment. (Had to buy rather than rent from Sony). There are so many great movies on the war. Herman Wouk's TV series is the best full telling of the story. You can view it online in High Def. now. I'll view it again for that. The Unknown War made from Soviet footage is hugely valuable. It's narrated by Burt Lancaster. It's in standard def only. I think that Herman Wouk's Caine Mutiny contributes much more to the story of gratitude owed to veterans. All of it is available from Amazon.The &#34;Last Metro&#34; comes to mind as I write. The list is long. &#34;Inglorious Bastards&#34; is a beautiful depiction of what should have happened to Nazis. There is a famous Byelorussian artist who depicted a Nazi concentration camp in his paintings. The art emphasizes the beauty of the victims and the nazis are depicted with comic disgust. The artist did magnificent Socialist art including images of the Soviet space program, and his work became religious later in his life. Much of his work was devoted to the Soviet resistance. There is a fine museum in Minsk devoted to Mikhail Savitsky. -His whole story would make a great movie.I'm pretty sensitive to anti-Soviet comments. The Monuments Men handled that well. They did not dump propaganda on us. We owe all of the Allied veterans our gratitude. They saved the world from fascism. America lost almost half a million, the Soviet Union lost way over 20 million, mostly in their homeland. Approximately 60 million died. Because of De-Nazification of Germany after the war, Germany is now one of the least fascist nations. However, I think we were dreaming in 1945 when we thought fascism was destroyed.

This movie dealt with a tough subject and I was a bit affronted by the annoying &#34;funny scenes&#34;. I definitely did like the fact that it showed the brutality of the destruction, though, and the acting of Holger Handtke was great, even though his appearances were few. His portrayal of Colonel Wegner made me want to punch all of his teeth out by the end of the film. I liked how they showcased the Ghent Altar-piece and the Bruges Madonna, as well as the burning of Raphael's Portrait of a Young Man and the Discovery of Pheidias' Boy removing Thorn from Foot.

1658751,ACJVGDN8G386P,B00DL48BM6,"classicalsteve ""classicalsteve""","[2, 3]","The first scene of the film is set in a church in Ghent, Belgium. Clerics are busily taking down a large paneled altarpiece which appears to be late medieval/early renaissance in its style. It's the Ghent Altarpiece, one of the most famous artworks ever forged in Europe. The panels are hastily taken down and put into a truck. Word is the Nazis are on their way to confiscate the work, possibly ordered by Adolph Hitler himself.We often think of Nazi-Germany in terms of what they did in battle and/or to certain religious and ethnic groups in Hitler's &#34;Final Solution&#34;. However, the Nazis didn't limit themselves only to the gunfire on the battlefields and the horrors of the concentration camps. Another aspect of Nazi-Germany's rape of Europe was the destruction of cultural heritage and legacy, particularly by plundering Europe's artwork from public museums and private collections. In nearly every country the Nazis overrun, they plundered museums and large private collections. It wasn't enough that they subjugated large populations to their totalitarian regime; they also stole their identities. The Monuments Men were a real-life group of &#34;soldiers&#34; assigned the daunting task of retrieving the art confiscated by the Nazis towards the end of the war. This film is about their story.George Clooney plays Frank Stokes who outlines the importance of retrieving the lost art: &#34;You can wipe out an entire generation, you can burn their homes to the ground and somehow they'll still find their way back. But if you destroy their history, you destroy their achievements and it's as if they never existed. That's what Hitler wants and that's exactly what we are fighting for.&#34; An evil power can subjugate France, but if it destroys the Louvre or Versailles, France itself becomes nearly destroyed. Save the Louvre and Versailles, France lives on.After the Ghent Altarpiece scene and Stokes' speech, &#34;the Monuments Men&#34; rings a bit like &#34;Ocean's 11&#34;, with Clooney soliciting art historians, scholars, and restorers from different parts of the United States. He puts together a small band of misfits who are either too old or too ill-equipped to be involved in the war on the front-lines. This is their way of being involved in the conflict in a significant way. Their mission: to find and retrieve the lost artwork either from public museums or private collections. The cast is a Who's Who of famous name talent in addition to Clooney: Matt Damon, Hugh Booneville, John Goodman, Bill Murray, and Bob Balaban, just to name a few.The band breaks off into smaller groups and each has their own story. One of the most interesting is that of real-life figure Rose Valland, although they changed her name to Claire Simone in the story. She has been spying on the Nazis while they've been abducting many great artworks in Paris. In real life, she became a heroine in the cause of stopping the Nazis from their plundering. In the film, she meets James Granger (Matt Damon), who needs her help in finding the art. At first she is reticent, believing he only wants to bring the art back to US museums. In another group, there's Richard Campbell and Preston Savitz (Murray and Balaban) who are following leads into the European countryside, hoping to find some of the lost treasures. Other members go by themselves seeking to save art not yet pilfered by the Nazis, such as Donald Jeffries who goes to the church housing a Madonna and Child by Michelangelo. Eventually the groups will converge and they hit the jack-pot in a way that would make auction houses Southeby's and Christie's salivate.Although much of the story is a bit exaggerated and doesn't always ring of true history, this is still a very enjoyable film about a subject which has had much less screen-time devoted to it than other subjects of World War II, at least in the United States. (Europe has been all too aware of the devastation of its art at the hands of the Nazis.)

1658757,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00DL48BM6,C. Sawin,"[7, 19]","Towards the end of World War II, a group of six men consisting of architects, museum and design directors, sculptors, and art historians including James Rorimer (Matt Damon), Sgt. Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), Sgt. Walter Garfield (John Goodman), Lt. Jean-Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin), Pvt. Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban), and Major Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville) are all gathered together by Frank Stokes (George Clooney) in order to protect and save artwork, buildings, and monuments that would otherwise be damaged or destroyed by the Nazis with the intent of returning the art to its original owner even if it means risking their own lives to do so.&#34;The Monuments Men&#34; was originally supposed to be released in December of 2013 in order to be eligible for the awards season. The comedic drama was pushed back to February of 2014 due to unforeseen delays in post-production thanks to the imbalance of humor mixed with the serious subject matter of the film. If you don't always make a mental note to be cautious about every film that's delayed for any reason then you should probably start now. More than likely said film is going to be disappointing or flat out terrible and &#34;The Monuments Men&#34; fails to really triumph over that conception.The idea of saving paintings, statues, and murals from the menacing grasp of Hitler and the Nazis is an intriguing one and hearing the stories of the men who risk their lives for what is otherwise just paint on a canvas or a hunk of stone sounds really exciting. Expectations are that it's likely an incredible adventure the likes of which Indiana Jones might find himself on . With a cast like this, the humor should naturally be off the charts and there should be some unbelievable chemistry between such a talented cast.Unfortunately, &#34;The Monuments Men&#34; is never able to fully capitalize on any potential you may expect. There's something there to appreciate, but it's as if there isn't enough of a main course to really impress you. The humor manages to make you snicker slightly, but never actually laugh out loud. The moments of comedy seem so brief and yet are the most memorable scenes in the film yet the only other noteworthy sequences the film has to offer are when tragedy strikes Frank's team. Bill Murray has one very specific scene that's extremely touching. Everything in between is just nothing but drawn out discussions about the job and extended speeches revolving around how important this work is for our country or honoring a deceased character you barely had the chance to get to know.&#34;The Monuments Men&#34; puts a lighthearted spin on what is otherwise a very bleak topic. Its good nature and patriotism are apparent right from the start. While there are moments of special chemistry between characters like John Goodman and Jean Dujardin or Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett and Bill Murray and John Goodman are able to squeeze in their beloved comedic quirks, &#34;The Monuments Men&#34; feels like an elongated treasure hunt with dull results that attempts to mimic the atmosphere of &#34;Ocean's Eleven&#34; and fails.",2,'The Monuments Men' review: A grizzled yet feeble endeavor,1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,3122,"['end', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'group', 'six', 'men', 'consisting', 'architects', 'museum', 'design', 'directors', 'sculptors', 'art', 'historians', 'including', 'James', 'Rorimer', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Sgt', 'Richard', 'Campbell', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Sgt', 'Walter', 'Garfield', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Lt.', 'Jean-Claude', 'Clermont', 'Jean', 'Dujardin', 'Pvt', 'Preston', 'Savitz', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'Major', 'Donald', 'Jeffries', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'are', 'gathered', 'together', 'Frank', 'Stokes', 'George', 'Clooney', 'order', 'protect', 'save', 'artwork', 'buildings', 'monuments', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'damaged', 'destroyed', 'Nazis', 'intent', 'returning', 'art', 'original', 'owner', 'even', 'risking', 'own', 'lives', 'do', 'so.', '34', 'Monuments', 'Men', '34', 'was', 'originally', 'supposed', 'be', 'released', 'December', '2013', 'order', 'be', 'eligible', 'awards', 'season', 'comedic', 'drama', 'was', 'pushed', 'back', 'February', '2014', 'due', 'unforeseen', 'delays', 'post-production', 'thanks', 'imbalance', 'humor', 'mixed', 'serious', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'mental', 'note', 'be', 'cautious', 'film', 'delayed', 'reason', 'then', 'should', 'probably', 'start', 'now', 'More', 'likely', 'said', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'disappointing', 'flat', 'terrible', '34', 'Monuments', 'Men', '34', 'fails', 'really', 'triumph', 'over', 'conception.The', 'idea', 'saving', 'paintings', 'statues', 'murals', 'menacing', 'grasp', 'Hitler', 'Nazis', 'intriguing', 'one', 'hearing', 'stories', 'men', 'who', 'risk', 'lives', 'what', 'otherwise', 'just', 'paint', 'canvas', 'hunk', 'stone', 'sounds', 'really', 'exciting', 'Expectations', 'are', 'likely', 'incredible', 'adventure', 'likes', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'might', 'find', 'cast', 'humor', 'should', 'naturally', 'be', 'off', 'charts', 'should', 'be', 'unbelievable', 'chemistry', 'talented', 'cast.Unfortunately', '34', 'Monuments', 'Men', '34', 'never', 'able', 'fully', 'capitalize', 'potential', 'may', 'expect', 'something', 'there', 'appreciate', ""n't"", 'enough', 'main', 'course', 'really', 'impress', 'humor', 'make', 'snicker', 'slightly', 'never', 'actually', 'out', 'loud', 'moments', 'comedy', 'seem', 'so', 'brief', 'yet', 'are', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'film', 'yet', 'only', 'other', 'noteworthy', 'sequences', 'film', 'offer', 'are', 'when', 'tragedy', 'Frank', 'team', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'one', 'very', 'specific', 'scene', 'extremely', 'touching', 'Everything', 'just', 'nothing', 'out', 'discussions', 'job', 'extended', 'speeches', 'revolving', 'how', 'important', 'work', 'country', 'honoring', 'deceased', 'character', 'barely', 'had', 'chance', 'get', 'know.', '34', 'Monuments', 'Men', '34', 'lighthearted', 'spin', 'what', 'otherwise', 'very', 'bleak', 'topic', 'good', 'nature', 'patriotism', 'are', 'apparent', 'right', 'start', 'are', 'moments', 'special', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Jean', 'Dujardin', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'John', 'Goodman', 'are', 'able', 'squeeze', 'beloved', 'comedic', 'quirks', '34', 'Monuments', 'Men', '34', 'feels', 'elongated', 'treasure', 'hunt', 'dull', 'results', 'attempts', 'mimic', 'atmosphere', '34', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', '34', 'fails']",N/A

The movie isn't perfect but its gifts outweigh its flaws.&#34;The Monument Men&#34; tells the story of a group of art experts recruited by the US armed forces during WW II to ensure that Europe's artistic heritage was not destroyed in the war.Hitler had been a painter before he became fuhrer. Joseph Goebbels was a novelist. Speer was an architect. Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl did as much to spread Nazism as many troops. Nazis didn't just mass murder human beings. They burned books and paintings. They worked very hard to destroy &#34;decadent&#34; art and to elevate and appropriate art they deemed worthy. Nazis plundered and stockpiled other countries' art. Just the other day, Feburary 6, 2014, art the Nazis stole from Poland was repatriated. In January, 2014, the World Jewish Congress demanded that Germany do a better job of returning art.There's a long tradition of World War II movies about international, all-star teams of experts uniting to achieve some goal: &#34;The Great Escape,&#34; &#34;The Guns of Navarone,&#34; &#34;Kelly's Heroes,&#34; &#34;Dirty Dozen,&#34; &#34;The Longest Day,&#34; &#34;A Bridge Too Far.&#34; And of course George Clooney is a veteran of the &#34;Oceans&#34; movies.&#34;The Monument Men&#34; is a little bit WW II team movie, a little bit Oceans. The team members are shown going about their day to day lives when George Clooney shows up and signs them up. The movie is based on a real project, and it plays like the best anecdotes from that project's team members. It's a series of vignettes that aren't particularly coherently connected. Some of the vignettes were not clear to me. Why was Matt Damon suddenly flying in a biplane over Paris at night? It was a pretty scene but I didn't understand how it fit into the rest of the plot. Why was the German-Jewish translator, Sam, suddenly carrying a wounded soldier into a mobile army surgical unit? Who was that soldier? Not sure.Other vignettes are really gripping, moving, suspenseful, and/or funny. The movie won me over with its depiction of a British art expert's heroic attempt to rescue a Michelangelo Madonna from Belgium. I cried. I was inspired.There is a funny, scary, sickening scene where a beefy German dentist hammers away at Bill Murray's teeth with a mallet and pliers while Bob Balaban makes provocative commentary about how he bets all the Germans were innocent &#8211; not.There's a powerful scene where Americans are invited to a German home for dinner, and discover that the paintings on the dining room walls are too good to be reproductions.The movie is flawed. Its editing is choppy. It feels rushed. I got the sense that not enough time was devoted to cast members building bonds with each other. John Goodman and Jean Dujardin are meant to be tight team members, but I saw no real chemistry between them. Not nearly enough time is devoted to fleshing out the all-star cast's characters, or to simple exposition. I'd simply like to know more about everything onscreen, from the Ghent altarpiece to Hitler's Nero decree. I would like to have seen the Nero decree's destruction of art placed into the context of the mass suicides at the end of the war. Hitler's suicide isn't even mentioned in &#34;Monuments Men.&#34;Sam, a GI, is recruited as a German translator. The average moviegoer might have no idea that Sam is Jewish. Sam says, &#34;I'm from NORTH Newark.&#34; How many moviegoers know that North Newark was a Jewish neighborhood? Sam says that his grandfather in Germany was not allowed to enter a museum and joked about being barred because he was &#34;too short.&#34; The real reason he was barred is that he was a Jew, but the movie never states that plainly.I got the impression that Clooney was making his film for people with short attention spans who want the shallowest treatment possible of the subject matter. That's too bad, because with a little more tender loving care, this could have been a great movie rather than a good one.Some popular culture and even academic retellings of WW II work to humanize, or even exculpate, Germans. &#34;Monuments Men&#34; does not. At first I thought that Sam would be the good German character &#8211; the noble &#34;true&#34; German who hated the Nazis from the get-go, resisted them, and was now helping the allies defeat them. But Sam turns out to be Jewish. &#34;Monuments Men&#34; uses the word &#34;German&#34; were a more German-friendly film would be careful to use the word &#34;Nazi,&#34; thus emphasizing that not all Germans were guilty, but merely an ideology.&#34;Monuments Men&#34; is unusual among recent American films in that it unapologetically and enthusiastically celebrates Western Civilization and the Christian heritage as something that utopians &#8211; in this case Nazis &#8211; tried to destroy, and that good people &#8211; among them Americans &#8211; heroically and courageously died to preserve. This is a really remarkable message. I wonder if left-wing Clooney embraced it because he saw &#34;Monuments Men&#34; as being about Art, not about Western Civ or the Judeo-Christian heritage. The two artworks focused on the most &#8211; the Ghent altarpiece and the Michelangelo Madonna are both overtly Christian.",4,"Big Fun, Big Heart, Old Fashioned",1391817600,"02 8,

1658765,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00DL48BM6,Darren,"[1, 1]","Hard to dislike this one.  Devoid of ""modern"" (read: cynical) movie sensibilities, directed by Clooney without irritating, pointless flash, its style is very much in keeping with the time-period in which it's set: honest, well-intentioned, to the point.  Clooney also stars as the chief of a small team of art experts who, with Allied Command's blessing, undertake a mission in the closing months of World War II to recover the thousands of art masterpieces that the Third Reich had ""appropriated"".  The names, and much else, has been changed, but it's a true story nonetheless.  Much of the art, along with a staggering amount of gold bullion, to say nothing of personal possessions of those whom the regime murdered (mostly Jews), were found in salt and copper mines across Germany.  However, some Picassos and Ernsts and suchlike were burned: Hitler hated modern art.  To get an idea of his taste, the movie shows a model of the proposed ""Fuehrer Museum"" planned for Linz.  It looked like a mausoleum.The movie's upbeat and earnest tone appears to have irritated the professional critics, but I'd imagine that most people would like it.  Not every movie -- not even every movie set in World War II -- need be a grim slog through horrors, guys.  Mostly the film goes for a light sense of humor, helped along by a brace of familiar faces, none of whom (thankfully) play against type:  Matt Damon, Bill Murray, Bob Balaban, John Goodman, Hugh Bonneville.  Clooney's design is to run the characters, mostly in mismatched pairs, on little errands to gather information about where the missing art is located.  Murray and Balaban, Goodman and Jean Dejardin.  Damon encounters Cate Blanchett, a former unwilling employee of a Vichy-run art museum.  There's an attraction.  He's got a wife at home.  However, she reminds him several times that it's Paris in April, so ... whaddayou gonna do?  I found it amusing.  There are some serious moments, too:  Clooney usefully reminds the team that without our culture we're nothing, and so their mission is an important one, even if they're not on the front-line of the battlefield.  What good is victory if we lose the record of our selves?  Good point.  Occasionally, though, things get a bit maudlin: I probably could've done without watching Murray cry in the shower.  And realistically, this story would've had a bigger impact if done as a miniseries, which would afford us the time to really get to know the ""Monuments Men"" and to get a more detailed grasp of the breathtaking scale of Nazi looting.Nonetheless, the movie serves as a whet to further interest on a fascinating topic, and is a pleasant two hours spent.

1658767,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B00DL48BM6,David A. Wend,"[3, 6]","I wanted to see Monuments Men from the first time I viewed the trailer for the film. The story of finding the works of art looted by the Nazis is an appealing subject for a film and a different twist on the Second World War.The film opens with several priests crating up the Van Eyck altarpiece in Ghent to remove it before the Nazis could take it. They failed and the priests are shot. The film switches to Frank Stokes (played by George Clooney) as he is making a proposal to President Roosevelt that a team be created to save as many cultural places and works of art from destruction. He is given permission but the overriding thought is that a work of art is not worth a human life.  Stokes assembles a team of art curators, art historians and architecture experts, visiting each one with orders for them to report for basic training. Eventually, he puts together a seven man team (Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Hugh Bonneville and Bob Balaban).In the meantime in occupied France, Claire Simone (nicely played by Cate Blanchett), a curator in the Paris Jeu de Palme, is forced to assist a Nazi officer named Viktor Stahl to process paintings for Adolf Hitler&#8217;s proposed F&uuml;hrermuseum in Linz, or for the personal collections of Herman Goering. She is nearly arrested for helping her brother to make an unsuccessfully attempt to recapture some art works. Stahl has all of the paintings removed and put aboard a train to Germany as the Allies approach Paris.Stokes&#8217; team arrived in Normandy shortly after D-Day and immediately encounters opposition from a colonel when he is asked to avoid shelling a church. The team members spilt up for different missions. Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville) attempts to stop the Nazis from stealing Michelangelo&#8217;s Madonna and Child from a Belgian cathedral by Nazi Colonel Wegner, and is killed when he tries to stop them. James Grainger (Matt Damon) goes undercover to Paris where he meets Claire, who has been put in prison as a collaborator, following the liberation of Paris. Gainger has Claire released but she never trusts him until he shows her Hitler&#8217;s so-called Nero Decree that mandates the destruction of the looted art.The film jumps from one historical event to another, so we are informed with an appropriate scene and wording of The Battle of the Bulge and the taking of the bridge at Remagen. The scenes are equally choppy and do not flow from one to the next. One wonders how the Monuments Men interacted with the army and did they always have opposition or did they receive more cooperation. Adding some additional scenes might have helped to make the film more coherent but this is such a large story that it is probably best told in a television series.  Incidentally, the film is not historically accurate in that there were dozens of members in the Monuments Men group and many more were British.  It also was formed in 1943 around the time of the Invasion of Sicily and not as a result of the shelling of Monte Cassino in 1944.The performances from all of the cast members are good and I liked the mix of humor and drama. The  photography, principally in Germany, is beautiful. The most exciting part of the film is when they are finding the paintings at the end of the film, when the team has to clear out as much art from a cave as they can before the Russians arrive to take control of their sector.Overall, Monuments Men is an interesting film that could be better.",4,Engaging But Could Have Been Better,1393286400,"02 25, 2014",2014,3481,"['wanted', 'see', 'Monuments', 'Men', 'first', 'time', 'viewed', 'trailer', 'film', 'story', 'finding', 'works', 'art', 'looted', 'Nazis', 'appealing', 'subject', 'film', 'different', 'twist', 'Second', 'World', 'War.The', 'film', 'several', 'priests', 'crating', 'up', 'Van', 'Eyck', 'altarpiece', 'Ghent', 'remove', 'Nazis', 'could', 'take', 'failed', 'priests', 'are', 'shot', 'film', 'switches', 'Frank', 'Stokes', 'played', 'George', 'Clooney', 'making', 'proposal', 'President', 'Roosevelt', 'team', 'be', 'created', 'save', 'many', 'cultural', 'places', 'works', 'art', 'destruction', 'given', 'permission', 'overriding', 'thought', 'work', 'art', 'not', 'worth', 'human', 'life', 'Stokes', 'team', 'art', 'curators', 'art', 'historians', 'architecture', 'experts', 'visiting', 'one', 'orders', 'report', 'basic', 'training', 'Eventually', 'together', 'seven', 'man', 'team', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Jean', 'Dujardin', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'Bob', 'Balaban', '.In', 'meantime', 'occupied', 'France', 'Claire', 'Simone', 'nicely', 'played', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'curator', 'Paris', 'Jeu', 'de', 'Palme', 'forced', 'assist', 'Nazi', 'officer', 'named', 'Viktor', 'Stahl', 'process', 'paintings', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', '8217', 's', 'proposed', 'F', 'uuml', 'hrermuseum', 'Linz', 'personal', 'collections', 'Herman', 'Goering', 'nearly', 'arrested', 'helping', 'brother', 'make', 'unsuccessfully', 'attempt', 'recapture', 'art', 'Stahl', 'paintings', 'removed', 'put', 'aboard', 'train', 'Germany', 'Allies', 'approach', 'Paris.Stokes', '8217', 'team', 'arrived', 'Normandy', 'shortly', 'D-Day', 'immediately', 'encounters', 'opposition', 'colonel', 'when', 'asked', 'avoid', 'shelling', 'church', 'team', 'members', 'spilt', 'up', 'different', 'missions', 'Donald', 'Jeffries', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'stop', 'Nazis', 'stealing', 'Michelangelo', '8217', 'Madonna', 'Child', 'Belgian', 'cathedral', 'Nazi', 'Colonel', 'Wegner', 'killed', 'when', 'stop', 'James', 'Grainger', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'undercover', 'Paris', 'where', 'Claire', 'who', 'been', 'put', 'prison', 'collaborator', 'following', 'liberation', 'Paris', 'Gainger', 'Claire', 'released', 'never', 'Hitler', '8217', 'so-called', 'Nero', 'Decree', 'destruction', 'looted', 'art.The', 'film', 'jumps', 'one', 'historical', 'event', 'are', 'informed', 'appropriate', 'scene', 'wording', 'Battle', 'Bulge', 'taking', 'bridge', 'Remagen', 'scenes', 'are', 'equally', 'choppy', 'do', 'not', 'flow', 'one', 'next', 'One', 'how', 'Monuments', 'Men', 'interacted', 'army', 'did', 'always', 'have', 'opposition', 'did', 'receive', 'more', 'cooperation', 'Adding', 'additional', 'scenes', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'coherent', 'such', 'large', 'story', 'probably', 'best', 'told', 'television', 'series', 'Incidentally', 'film', 'not', 'historically', 'accurate', 'were', 'dozens', 'members', 'Monuments', 'Men', 'group', 'many', 'more', 'were', 'British', 'also', 'was', 'formed', '1943', 'time', 'Invasion', 'Sicily', 'not', 'result', 'shelling', 'Monte', 'Cassino', '1944.The', 'performances', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'good', 'liked', 'mix', 'humor', 'drama', 'photography', 'principally', 'Germany', 'beautiful', 'most', 'exciting', 'part', 'film', 'when', 'are', 'finding', 'paintings', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'team', 'clear', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'art', 'cave', 'can', 'Russians', 'arrive', 'take', 'control', 'sector.Overall', 'Monuments', 'Men', 'interesting', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'better']",N/A

Out of the red-hot AWARDS race?  It must be a total dud!&#34;  Particularly not a film such as The Monuments Men, with its dream-team cast of A-list stars and scene-stealing comic character actors, not to mention an interesting true story showing an often filmed conflict (the Second World War) from an unusual perspective (a team of out-of-shape, untrained collectors, historians, and scholars traveling into the line of fire to recover stolen art and protect historic buildings).  After viewing the film, though, I must say:  it is not hard to understand why the studio dodged the extra unforgiving spotlight of a year-end prestige release date because this is an unprecedented disaster which finds a thousand and one ways to fail to realize its vast potential, fail to utilize its ace cast, and otherwise frustrate and bore audiences.One major problem is its borderline insane shifts in purpose and tone.  A great film can amuse, excite, frighten, and uplift in turn, but no shift here, always signaled by the overbearing score, is completed with grace.  One second it goes for grave tears (the characters find a container overflowing with small pieces of gold, and one among them recognizes them as Jews' gold teeth).  Five seconds later, it is again a pure and farcical caper film:  Ocean's Wartime Eleven, but without any genuine sense of danger, fun, style, or wit.  Another major flaw:  a near total absence of structure.  A few characters go here.  A few characters go there.  Maybe this one slightly bonds with this one.  This story calls out for suspense and wonder, for a sense of propulsion, but the end result is defined by heavy eyelids and so-measured-as-to-be-inert pacing.  None of the actors shine; there is definitely trouble afoot when a film has Bill Murray and John Goodman in the same room, and the pairing results in nothing memorable or even modestly playful.  Either Matt Damon's character or George Clooney's is intended as the driving hero of the piece, but it never becomes completely clear which.  Character development is close to nonexistent beyond brief references to each man's profession and perhaps whether or not he has a family at home.  There is also a self-important and groan inducing cameo in the very last scene which is almost embarrassing to endure considering the low quality of what has come before, but do not even get me started regarding this final spot of indulgent nonsense.Yet another sin of The Monuments Men:  despite one, two, three, four...I do not know, maybe ten heavy-handed monologues/sermons regarding the importance of protecting art and preserving culture during times of crisis (Art Is the Ultimate Record of Our Very Existence, Damn It!), the film has a curious and notable disinterest in the subject, almost never pausing to truly absorb the glory of a particular painting or sculpture.

With its jaunty theme music (by Alexandre Desplat), devil-may-care theme and tongue-in-cheek humor, it is a movie with its roots in classic World War II dramas such as John Sturges' THE GREAT ESCAPE (1963).  Structurally speaking, THE MONUMENTS MEN is very similar - a group of representatives of assorted nations take on the full might of the Nazi army (as well as some obstructive American and British officers) and manage to achieve their goals through a combination of cunning, luck and sheer brazenness.  THE MONUMENTS MEN is a little propagandist in tone; there is little need, for instance, for a shot at the end of the film showing the American flag, a &#34;present&#34; left for the advancing Russian army once the monuments men have rescued some stolen treasure.  Nonetheless the film's theme is highly pertinent in view of the destruction wrought to many irreplaceable art treasures in Iraq and Syria in recent years: one hopes that similar groups will be formed so as to save some of them.  The actors enjoy themselves in their roles, notably Matt Damon as James Granger, an American officer speaking incomprehensible French, and Bob Balaban and Bill Murray as a pair of perpetually warring art specialists.,  Cate Blanchett turns in an agreeable cameo as French spy - with a convincing accent.

1658806,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00DL48BM6,FNDNreview,"[2, 7]","To this day, World War II is the deadliest military conflict in the history of man - with an estimated casualty count of anywhere from 50 to 85 million lives lost.  The war ended nearly 70 years ago, but it&#8217;s still fresh in a lot of people&#8217;s minds, especially since there&#8217;s no shortage of films featuring the wide variety of events that took place during the six-year (plus one day) war.  From films like Schindler&#8217;s List and The Longest Day to Flags of Our Fathers and Patton, new generations are able to get a glimpse and be reminded &#8211; through superb filmmaking reenactments, of what bravery looked like in the early 1940s.  However, heroics were not just reserved for the individuals that enlisted or who were drafted to protect their county, but also for those that took on their own cause.  And, in the case of the film, The Monuments Men &#8211; it was a cause of devotion to recovery and preservation.The Monuments Men, which is based on the novel of the same name by Robert M. Edsel, is directed by George Clooney (Leatherheads, The Ides of March), who also stars as Frank Stokes &#8211; an army leader of a group of men devoted to the cause of preserving art in Europe during World War II.  With the war nearly over and the Germans in near full retreat, Stokes enlists the help of several fellow art enthusiasts, including James Granger (Matt Damon), Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), and Walter Garfield (John Goodman), to accompany him to Europe and maneuver around the final skirmishes to begin tracking down precious pieces of art that should be recovered and preserved for the good of culture and humanity.Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was a well-known lover of art and even an artist himself in his younger years.  As the dictator of Germany, he plans to construct and open a F&uuml;hrer museum and orders his officers to steal the most precious art pieces ever created, including the Alterpiece &#8211; which is comprised of several different panel paintings.  The Altarpiece, along with several other priceless paintings and sculptures fall into the hands of the Nazis, and the officers have orders that &#8211; in the event Hitler falls &#8211; to burn and destroy everything.Looking to make contact with anyone that might be able to help them, Granger eventually meets a former museum curator and supposed French traitor, Claire (Cate Blanchett), who might possibly know the locations of the art.  But, with time running out, it has put the men in the difficult position of each trying to individually find their own leads to recover the Nazi-possessed art.  The only question is: will they be able to locate the stolen items before the Nazi army has the opportunity to destroy it?Much like Saving Private Ryan, The Monuments Men is about a group of men that are assembled with one specific task.  However, unlike Saving Private Ryan, this film lacks a clear, specific goal other than the randomized repossession of stolen art.  These men are not regulars in the army and are nothing more than art enthusiasts &#8211; meaning for much of the film they appear to be randomly wondering the countryside like a chicken with their heads cut off chasing after nothing in particular.  In the beginning, this film attempts to make it about retrieving one specific item &#8211; the Altarpiece, yet if that&#8217;s the lone goal, the underlying premise will often elude your thoughts.  And, eventually emotional attachment comes into play as Clooney&#8217;s character sets his sights on recovering one sculpture, called The Madonna of Bruges.This film may star two high-profile actors in George Clooney and Matt Damon, but this film hardly highlights either one of them.  Oddly enough, this is a film less about specific acting ability and more about the occasionally broad story itself.  The wide range of characters is given relatively equal screen time, although it may lean a bit more so in the direction of Matt Damon &#8211; whose mission appears to be slightly more important than the rest.  Still, seeing John Goodman and Bill Murray in this film obviously lightens the mood, making a for a few brief moments of ironic humor &#8211; the most memorable of which takes place during their brief stint in basic training.Honestly, the lovers of action-packed war films will be vastly disappointed in what this film has to off you.  Sure, there are encounters that require the abbreviated use of weaponry, but that&#8217;s not exactly the point of this flick.  The war is coming to its end, and as you might have already anticipated, it causes this film to drag on more often than not.  Imagine a film where all you see is men cleaning up the mess after all the action takes place and that&#8217;s roughly what you&#8217;ll see here.  Still, for me personally (as a lover of everything history-based), the lagging story wasn&#8217;t that noticeable &#8211; but for anyone that doesn&#8217;t find historical films to be all that entertaining (at least without action), this film could understandably feel like it goes on for an eternity rather than two hours.Overall, The Monuments Men focuses on an isolated story that took place right about the time the dust was settling.  To that end, it&#8217;s commendable that a story like this receives attention &#8211; yet the film is noticeably clustered and lacks a prime directive.  It&#8217;s as though the assertion is there but the emotion is absent.  The characters are spread extremely thin as far as their back-stories go and it makes it difficult to resonate with their individual predicaments as the story progresses.  History enthusiasts might find a certain amount of enjoyment or entertainment in this story, but for a film with unmistakably high-profile actors, it easy to see how this film could be a monumental disappointment &#8211; no pun intended.GRADE:  CFNDNreview.com",3,"'The Monuments Men' recounts occasionally slow-paced, informative story",1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,5866,"['day', 'World', 'War',

Edsel and Bret Witter and adapted for the screen by director George Clooney and Grant Heslov, this true story gets all Hallmarky despite the theme and a fine cast. The problem is that the mystery has been removed and in its place are series of actor shots paying homage to the real monuments men of history. As a result we really don't get to know about any of them and the mission becomes a game, a dangerous and courageous at times game, but a game nevertheless.Based on the premise of Clooney's character Frank Stokes, `You can wipe out an entire generation, you can burn their homes to the ground and somehow they'll still find their way back. But if you destroy their history, you destroy their achievements and it's as if they never existed. That's what Hitler wants and that's exactly what we are fighting for' the film concerns the gathering of a groups of arts oriented men to rescue art masterpieces from Nazi thieves following WW II and return them to their owners. It is based a true story The Monuments Men is `an action drama focusing on an unlikely World War II platoon, tasked by FDR with going into Germany to rescue artistic masterpieces from Nazi thieves and returning them to their rightful owners. It would be an impossible mission: with the art trapped behind enemy lines, and with the German army under orders to destroy everything as the Reich fell, how could these guys - seven museum directors, curators, and art historians, all more familiar with Michelangelo than the M-1 - possibly hope to succeed? But as the Monuments Men, as they were called, found themselves in a race against time to avoid the destruction of 1000 years of culture, they would risk their lives to protect and defend mankind's greatest achievements.' The hoopla from Sony so states.The cast includes George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban and Hugh Bonneville as the disparate rescue squad. The best performance in the film is Cate Blanchett's well considered role as Clara Simone, the only one who seems to have an original idea in her mind. Dimitri Leonidas impresses in a small but significant role of a Jew who stays in company with the Monuments Men. It could have been written better and acted with more commitment, but as a movie it is good entertainment.

His readiness to view the film a second time confirmed it.How does one teach respect.

The reality is worthy of any kind of attention.That I would attempt to get my son to see a film like this would not be surprising.  That he labored to get all of us, his family, to see the movie reflects his effort to involve those he loves in something of value.My son is growing through the stages of his life in the here and now, cognizant that his future is embedded in the past.

Seemed more like a tour of famous art collections in Hollywood.3. The dialogue not only seemed misplaced but had that Hollywood writer speak to it; overeducated, over articulated Beverly Hills cleanliness.4.

1658845,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00DL48BM6,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[9, 13]","The film is of course important for the wide popular public who does not know at all anything about that systematic looting of works of arts of any type by the Nazis. The public does not know millions of works of arts are concerned and this operation launched by Roosevelt in 1943 enabled millions of them to be recuperated, maybe not millions but a great, great number. Note Roosevelt knew about art and culture, but it is sure Truman did not know the word, let alone the ""thing.""The film is important to show that this operation could only succeed if it was American, English and French at once since it was supposed to follow the front starting in Normandy just after D day and prevent the Nazis from doing what Hitler had ordered: destroy everything you can. Leave behind you a devastated and burnt out land. And actually we have a mistake in the film when it pretends the objective of Hitler was to destroy European culture.In fact the objective was to take possession of all they could and put it up in a F&uuml;hrer Museum in Hitler's birth place in Austria. Hitler wanted to alienate the Europeans of their culture and force them to come humble and trembling to this museum to see what once was theirs. That was in fact even more cruel than just destroying it since it was not turning Europeans into deculturalized slaves but into zoo animals coming to see what they used to be. And when they were reduced to zoo animals then it was a lot easier to shoot them point blank but with live ammunition.But there is also another shortcoming that is in fact ideological. The decision to destroy all those works of art was a final war measure from Hitler, but it became in the film a way not to speak of something else. The fact that millions of works of arts were plainly stolen in a way or another by plain ordinary people, like the neighbors who looted the apartment of a Jewish family that had just been arrested. Ot this Jewish family that survived in France from beginning to end by going from one hiding place to the next and paying their passage with some silverware. And we must not forget the duly paid for SNCF trains to transport everything imaginable from human deported people to treasures or ammunitions and troops.And it also neglects the fact that a great number of works of art were saved by simple people who recuperated them in due time and hid them away like the tapestries of La Chaise Dieu to bring them back out once the war was finished, or even a long time later like the bronze sculptures of the Quinconces in Bordeaux that only reappeared in the 1980s.The saving of the Bruges Madonna by Michel Ange and of the Ghent altarpiece just before the arrival of the Russians, is kind of cold war in spirit ahead of history, especially since this salvation was in fact possible because the local German miners had blown up the three entrances of the mine to prevent the Nazis from doing what they intended to do. Here gain the message is fuzzy. Millions of Europeans risked their life to save someone or something that was considered as valuable because the Nazis wanted them. The popular dimension is mostly ignored and reduced to anecdotic little facts, even with Claire who actually did a tremendous work to list the immensity of the spoils. Only this last case is given some prominence, but it was not possible without a very serious organization behind and under this surface.In other words this film could have been a master piece but it only speaks of masterpieces without being one. Sorry for it.

Based on the non-fiction book, a 500 or so page tome entitledThe Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in Historyby Robert M. Edsel, the film relates the true story of a motley group of aging art experts tasked with finding and saving pieces of art and other culturally important items before their destruction by Hitler and the Nazis during the waning days of World War II.Originally scheduled to be released in December of 2013, the film appeared on American screens in early February 2014 several weeks before the Oscars were handed out for excellence in Hollywood movie making for the preceding year. The heroic efforts of The Monuments Men would have to wait another year to snag a nomination or two. The selection of films and performances presented for consideration from 2013 had few heroes. We had stories about a bunch of Somali pirates, a corrupt Wall Street swindler, a dysfunctional family in Oklahoma, a Texas hustler who profited from importing AIDS medications, another sad tale of slavery, and a spinster trying to sell her tales to Walt Disney.George Clooney is to be praised for bringing the story of a few aging ""art warriors"" to the big screen.  The Monuments Men tried to preserve Europe's cultural history by volunteering to find about five million pieces of artwork stolen by the Nazis from wealthy Jews, museums, universities and churches before they were destroyed.  It's a heroic adventure, the largest treasure hunt ever conceived.  And a true story about some of the men and women from 13 countries who gave their time, talent, and effort for this worthwhile cause. Over 6,500 paintings were found at the salt mines in Altaussee, Austria. Gold bullion and 400 paintings from Berlin vaults were found in the copper mines in Merkers, Germany.  Entire valuable private collections of wealthy Frenchmen were found at Neuschwanstein Castle in Germany. Important works such as the ""Madonna of Bruges"" by Michelangelo and Van Eyck's medieval Ghent altarpiece were salvaged.Interestingly, THE MONUMENTS MEN is not a war movie: it's Saving Mr. Rembrandt not SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. And it's not really a humor-in-the-time-of-war film like MASH nor a comedic-drama like OCEANS ELEVEN although Clooney plays a Harvard art restorer who gathers his ""buds"" for the adventure and some fun.  It's a profound bit of historical and biographical drama.  And it's about heroes.Hollywood needs more movies about heroes.",4,Hollywood needs more movies about heroes...,1394582400,"03 12, 2014",2014,2713,"['Monuments', 'Men', '2014', 'American-German', 'film', 'directed', 'George', 'Clooney', 'written', 'produced', 'Clooney', 'Grant', 'Heslov', 'starring', 'Clooney', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Jean', 'Dujardin', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Based', 'non-fiction', 'book', '500', 'so', 'page', 'tome', 'entitledThe', 'Monuments', 'Men', 'Allied', 'Heroes', 'Nazi', 'Thieves', 'Greatest', 'Treasure', 'Hunt', 'Historyby', 'Robert', 'M.', 'Edsel', 'film', 'true', 'story', 'motley', 'group', 'aging', 'art', 'experts', 'tasked', 'finding', 'saving', 'pieces', 'art', 'other', 'culturally', 'important', 'items', 'destruction', 'Hitler', 'Nazis', 'waning', 'days', 'World', 'War', 'II.Originally', 'scheduled', 'be', 'released', 'December', '2013', 'film', 'appeared', 'American', 'screens', 'early', 'February', '2014', 'several', 'weeks', 'Oscars', 'were', 'handed', 'out', 'excellence', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'making', 'preceding', 'year', 'heroic', 'efforts', 'Monuments', 'Men', 'would', 'have', 'wait', 'year', 'snag', 'nomination', 'two', 'selection', 'films', 'performances', 'presented', 'consideration', '2013', 'had', 'few', 'heroes', 'had', 'stories', 'bunch', 'Somali', 'pirates', 'corrupt', 'Wall', 'Street', 'swindler', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'Oklahoma', 'Texas', 'hustler', 'who', 'profited', 'importing', 'AIDS', 'medications', 'sad', 'tale', 'slavery', 'spinster', 'trying', 'sell', 'tales', 'Walt', 'Disney.George', 'Clooney', 'be', 'praised', 'bringing', 'story', 'few', 'aging', 'art', 'warriors', 'big', 'screen', 'Monuments', 'Men', 'tried', 'preserve', 'Europe', 'cultural', 'history', 'volunteering', 'find', 'five', 'million', 'pieces', 'artwork', 'stolen', 'Nazis', 'wealthy', 'Jews', 'museums', 'universities', 'churches', 'were', 'destroyed', 'heroic', 'adventure', 'largest', 'treasure', 'hunt', 'ever', 'conceived', 'true', 'story', 'men', 'women', '13', 'countries', 'who', 'gave', 'time', 'talent', 'effort', 'worthwhile', 'cause', '6,500', 'paintings', 'were', 'found', 'salt', 'mines', 'Altaussee', 'Austria', 'Gold', 'bullion', '400', 'paintings', 'Berlin', 'vaults', 'were', 'found', 'copper', 'mines', 'Merkers', 'Germany', 'Entire', 'valuable', 'private', 'collections', 'wealthy', 'Frenchmen', 'were', 'found', 'Neuschwanstein', 'Castle', 'Germany', 'Important', 'such', 'Madonna', 'Bruges', 'Michelangelo', 'Van', 'Eyck', 'medieval', 'Ghent', 'altarpiece', 'were', 'salvaged.Interestingly', 'MONUMENTS', 'MEN', 'not', 'war', 'movie', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Rembrandt', 'not', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN', 'not', 'really', 'humor-in-the-time-of-war', 'film', 'MASH', 'comedic-drama', 'OCEANS', 'ELEVEN', 'Clooney', 'Harvard', 'art', 'restorer', 'who', 'buds', 'adventure', 'fun', 'profound', 'bit', 'historical', 'biographical', 'drama', 'heroes.Hollywood', 'needs', 'more', 'movies', 'heroes']",N/A

He has assembled an attractive cast, collaborated on the PG-13 screenplay, and directed this piece, but sometimes....Okay, let's talk about the film. As we all know, Adolph Hitler intended to amass the world's greatest collection of classic art for his Thousand-Year Reich; as a result he plundered museums, churches, art galleries and private collections. (Modern art, created by upstarts like Pablo Picasso and his ilk, was simply burned.) FDR tasked a group of art historians and museum curators to find the missing art, the fear being that as the Nazis lost the war, they might simply burn EVERYTHING. This fictionalized story is inspired by that directive.If you want to see the actual MONUMENTAL task undertaken by the Allied forces (NOT just American) please check out ""The Rape of Europa,"" which is a jaw-dropping documentary drawn from newsreels, photographs and film clips. Only one scene in this drama alludes to the Allied effort to avoid bombing certain buildings as the war continued. You will never look at European art (or architecture) the same way again. Notice that Amazon has both DVDs offered side by side!For this story, here are some of the actors we admire:* George Clooney (""Gravity"") is Frank Stokes, the idealistic leader of this little squad, which is comprised of men from the art world, who will recognize fine art when they see it. Each has, for one reason or another, been declared ""unfit"" for regular duty.* Matt Damon (""Elysium"") plays James Granger, an art professional pulled from his duties in New York City, to try and rescue priceless European art. He learned to speak (poor) French in Canada and he never forgets he has a wife and two daughters waiting for him...* Bill Murray (""Hyde Park on the Hudson"") is Richard Campbell, stuck with the obstacle course in basic training and an armed Nazi, later.* Jean Dujardin (an Oscar for ""The Artist"") is Jean Claude Clermont, recruited to help because he is French and actually CARES what happens to their art. I've only seen this actor in comic roles, so was pleasantly surprised!* Cate Blanchett (""Blue Jasmine"") plays Claire Simone, an employee of the Jeu de Paume, who kept meticulous records of the art that came through her museum.I particularly liked seeing George's handsome father play Frank Stokes 30 years later when he visits Michelangelo's Madonna and Child with a grandson in Bruges.

When we were younger, we even used a vacation to explore the battlefields of Market-Garden and the Ardennes. So we were at the first showing of Monuments Men this morning. I had read mixed reviews about the film, but both of us give it two thumbs up. I didn't read the book the movie is supposedly based on, but this is Hollywood's version anyway, so I can't comment on the factual content of the film, but it was entertaining from the beginning to the very poignant ending.So many movies nowadays depend so heavily on CGI and making things go boom that it was enjoyable to see some fine actors plying their trade on the big screen. First, Cate Blanchett alone is worth the price of admission. I fell in love with her in ""Elizabeth,"" and she hasn't lost a bit of her appeal. Playing Claire Simone, a Parisian woman working in an art museum for a German officer, she gave a superb performance. In an early scene, she's been wrongly arrested as a collaborator, and James Granger, one of the Monuments Men played by Matt Damon, is talking to her in a jail cell while she slowly rolls a cigarette, then lights up. It's a remarkably sensual scene that may entice you to take up smoking. Blanchett is the only female character who has more than a couple of lines in the movie. The male actors are an excellent ensemble, with no one really hogging the camera. My favorite: Bob Balaban, playing the character of Preston Savitz, may have been the sleeper in the cast. Looking like the quiet, mild-mannered academic he was, he had some nice scenes, including a standoff with a German soldier who got the drop on him. I'm not a huge George Clooney fan, but I have to say he gave a very good performance as Captain Frank Stokes, the leader of the group.The moviemakers did a great job of recreating the ruined European cities the Monuments Men passed through in their search for stolen art. The cinematography was excellent. Overall, it was a very enjoyable film about a little known footnote of WWII.The film piqued my curiosity about the real Monuments Men, so I looked them up on Wikipedia. In a nutshell: The ""Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives"" program under the Civil Affairs and Military Government Sections of the Allied armies was established in 1943 to help protect cultural property in war areas during and after World War II. The group of about 400 service members and civilians worked with military forces to safeguard historic and cultural monuments from war damage, and as the conflict came to a close, to find and return works of art and other items of cultural importance that had been stolen by the Germans or hidden for safekeeping.",5,Two thumbs up for a very entertaining film,1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,2776,"['wife', 'are', 'aging', 'baby', 'boomers', 'born', 'just', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'ended', 'guess', 'had', 'lot', 'do', 'interest', 'WWII', 'When', 'were', 'younger', 'even', 'used', 'vacation', 'explore', 'battlefields', 'Market-Garden', 'Ardennes', 'were', 'first', 'showing', 'Monuments', 'Men', 'morning', 'had', 'read', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'film', 'give', 'two', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'supposedly', 'based', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'anyway', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'factual', 'content', 'film', 'was', 'entertaining', 'beginning', 'very', 'poignant', 'ending.So', 'many', 'movies', 'nowadays', 'depend', 'so', 'heavily', 'CGI', 'making', 'things', 'go', 'boom', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'see', 'fine', 'actors', 'plying', 'trade', 'big', 'screen', 'First', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'alone', 'price', 'admission', 'fell', 'love', 'Elizabeth', ""n't"", 'lost', 'bit', 'appeal', 'Playing', 'Claire', 'Simone', 'Parisian', 'woman', 'working', 'art', 'museum', 'German', 'officer', 'gave', 'superb', 'performance', 'early', 'scene', 'been', 'wrongly', 'arrested', 'collaborator', 'James', 'Granger', 'one', 'Monuments', 'Men', 'played', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'talking', 'jail', 'cell', 'slowly', 'cigarette', 'then', 'up', 'remarkably', 'sensual', 'scene', 'may', 'entice', 'take', 'up', 'smoking', 'Blanchett', 'only', 'female', 'character', 'who', 'more', 'couple', 'lines', 'movie', 'male', 'actors', 'are', 'excellent', 'ensemble', 'one', 'really', 'hogging', 'camera', 'favorite', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'playing', 'character', 'Preston', 'Savitz', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'sleeper', 'cast', 'Looking', 'quiet', 'mild-mannered', 'was', 'had', 'nice', 'scenes', 'including', 'standoff', 'German', 'soldier', 'who', 'got', 'drop', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'George', 'Clooney', 'fan', 'have', 'say', 'gave', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'Captain', 'Frank', 'Stokes', 'leader', 'group.The', 'moviemakers', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'recreating', 'ruined', 'European', 'cities', 'Monuments', 'Men', 'passed', 'search', 'stolen', 'art', 'cinematography', 'was', 'excellent', 'Overall', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'little', 'known', 'footnote', 'WWII.The', 'film', 'piqued', 'curiosity', 'real', 'Monuments', 'Men', 'looked', 'up', 'Wikipedia', 'nutshell', 'Monuments', 'Fine', 'Arts', 'Archives', 'program', 'Civil', 'Affairs', 'Military', 'Government', 'Sections', 'Allied', 'armies', 'was', 'established', '1943', 'help', 'protect', 'cultural', 'property', 'war', 'areas', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'group', 'about', '400', 'service', 'members', 'civilians', 'worked', 'military', 'forces', 'safeguard', 'historic', 'cultural', 'monuments', 'war', 'damage', 'conflict', 'came', 'close', 'find', 'return', 'works', 'art', 'other', 'items', 'cultural', 'importance', 'had', 'been', 'stolen', 'Germans', 'hidden', 'safekeeping']",N/A

If it was being lost then Hitler's ""Nero Decree"", or scorched earth policy, was to come into effect. Everything of value was to be destroyed or torched by the Nazis. The ultimate in pure spite.A team of middle-aged men was formed to try and locate and rescue the art treasures. Art treasures that were looted by the Nazis. This undercover unit of artists was Art's answer to Dad's Army. This unlikely bunch, most of whom were not exactly in the first flush of youth, were then propelled into the war zone. They were the so-called ""Monuments Men"" of the movie's title.Interestingly, it was the Monuments Men who found the famous fake Vermeer in Goering's stash. The fake was done by Dutch forger Hans van Meegeren. ( An excellent account of van Meegeren's life and works can be found in ""I Was Vermeer: The Forger Who Swindled the Nazis"" by Frank Wynne).The film stars and is directed by George Clooney. Matt Damon stood in for Daniel Craig (Who had scheduling problems). Bill Murray is perfectly cast as the architect from Chicago. John Goodman and Cate Blanchett also star, the latter giving a particularly good performance.This film shouldn't be compared with Ocean's Eleven and all that. It's a slightly different type of film we have here. One that acknowledges the historical reality involved. Even so, Clooney tries to put a kind of jaunty ""Great Escape"" spin on some of the film - as well as a touch of Alan Alda's MASH.Despite all the acting talent, the film never quite clicks into high gear. You feel as if something is missing. Nevertheless I would recommend this movie. The story should be told and not forgotten.

Specialists are sent to Europe at their own request to find the billions of dollars of stolen masterpieces of historic art and wealth stolen by the Nazi German army.  It is simply an ego and greed play by the German army under the orders of Adolph Hitler to steal everything they can find and bring it back to Germany.  He wants to build a special Fuhrer's Museum of stolen art treasures.The Europeans don't trust the Americans as they have seen the Germans and the Russians stealing everything they can lay their hands on.  The Americans are sincere about wanting to return the stolen property to the original owners and keep the Germans from destroying the priceless art out of hate.....This is a serious movie with a lot of violence and blood in it.  It is the realism of war and the risk all of our soldiers were exposed too during the war.  It is a true story about a group of men assigned the task to help track down and preserve the art of Europe.  The movie shows the real tragedies of war and of the evil of men. It also shows the tragic death of many men.  The film is realistic in its presentation of war and it is rated PG 13.The Germans begin burning all of the art so no one will have it when they realized that they were losing the war.  It is a sad depiction of the evil of men and the atrocities of war.  Not only artwork, jewelry, and gold were found but grotesque items the will make you realize how dangerous the Nazi mentality was.I can sum up this movie for me in one sentence.  It is an excellent movie, great acting, solidly directed and a good story. I think that many people expected a comedy based on the members of the cast but for the most part they played their roles well.  This movie was not based on CGI graphics or futuristic technology but on a true story out of our history.

There's a matter of factness about them, as well as an admiration and respect for the courage of ordinary people who are doing extraordinary things.Well worth watching as an inspiring story of decency (the quest of the Monuments Men was to return the misappropriated works to their true owners), courage (they were doing their work while fighting was taking place around them) and vision (their wish was to retain artworks of importance to culture and civilisation).It is a fitting tribute to the courage and vision of the Monuments Men, as well as being another example of George Clooney's talent as a film maker (director and co-writer).",4,"An inspiring true story of decency, courage and tenacity, sympathetically and entertainingly told",1396051200,"03 29, 2014",2014,1703,"['docudrama', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Monuments', 'Men', 'Monuments', 'Fine', 'Arts', 'Archives', 'section', 'Allies', 'WWII.It', 'well', 'crafted', 'tale', 'courageous', 'activities', 'small', 'corp', 'largely', 'middle', 'aged', 'academics', 'museum', 'curators', 'architects', 'historians', 'who', 'volunteered', 'find', 'recover', 'misappropriated', 'artworks.The', 'story', 'told', 'straightforward', 'yet', 'entertaining', 'fashion', 'explaining', 'establishment', 'group', 'then', 'illustrating', 'activities', 'successes.There', 'are', 'moments', 'humor', 'sadness.All', 'actors', 'are', 'well', 'cast', 'work', 'together', 'tell', 'story', 'was', 'largely', 'unknown', 'recently.The', 'relationship', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'characters', 'particularly', 'poignant.At', 'end', 'film', 'historical', 'photographs', 'activities', 'are', 'shown', 'closing', 'credits.In', 'respects', 'style', 'film', 'reminded', 'positive', 'way', 'WWII', 'docudramas', 'produced', '1950s', 'such', 'Dambusters', 'Ice', 'Cold', 'Alex', 'as', 'well', 'Counterfeit', 'Traitor', 'matter', 'factness', 'as', 'well', 'admiration', 'respect', 'courage', 'ordinary', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'doing', 'extraordinary', 'things.Well', 'worth', 'watching', 'inspiring', 'story', 'decency', 'quest', 'Monuments', 'Men', 'was', 'return', 'misappropriated', 'works', 'true', 'owners', 'courage', 'were', 'doing', 'work', 'fighting', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'vision', 'wish', 'was', 'retain', 'artworks', 'importance', 'culture', 'civilisation', '.It', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'courage', 'vision', 'Monuments', 'Men', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'example', 'George', 'Clooney', 'talent', 'film', 'maker', 'director', 'co-writer']",N/A

Just a boring movie on a subject  (the theft of invaluable art works by the Nazis during WWII and recovery by allied agents) that should be fascinating. I knew the movie was in trouble from the start when it included Bill Murray, an actor I love, but horribly miscast. George Clooney plays the head officer in charge of recovering the art with other roles played by Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, Bob Balaban, John Goodman, and a few others. Nothing works. It seems that Clooney tried to make something of a buddy movie with unfunny jokes and situations spread throughout. A movie of this sort would have been better taken seriously. The French  resistance woman played by Blanchett was based on a real woman. That story as the focus of the movie would have been fascinating. As it is the movie tries to come off as a serious movie interspersed with moments of comedy or what Clooney apparently thinks is amusing. It fails on all points.  When the so-called big moments of the movie arrive, it's just a huge letdown they're done so poorly.

I also really like this movie - it is not gritty particularly, does have a more humoristic approach at times, and tells a heck of a WW2 story.  I honestly don't understand the criticism about this movie.  It feels like a lot of people were either expecting the same thing they've seen over and over with grit, gore, and length, or frankly had a skeptical/cynical attitude from the start and immediately I-phoned in snarky reviews about how the movie didn't entertain them enough.This movie was not a gore fest, so... it's unrealistic then?  This movie does not have each character sit down, stare at the camera and tell you some long back story that is designed to tug at your heart strings, so... the characters are not developed enough?  There are many characters in many different storylines/missions that sometimes meet back together, as is the case with any ensemble cast movie, so... the movie should have been 3 hours long with a narrator explaining to you what was going on with each scene change?The point of the movie was about the Nazi threat to the cultural achievements over the past centuries, and how that threat was identified and combated by a group of middle-aged art professionals.  I really liked that for once we didn't have some Tarentino-type decapitations, or intestines sprawled on the ground, and cussing for the sake of cussing.  No shock value kind of stuff, which I suppose maybe made some people bored.  But this is not that kind of movie.  This movie told a valuable story based on a true story, in an older-type way, with men who you felt were leaders who led with courage.  It is another tale out of many, of lesser-known heroes overcoming adversity against Nazis.  This movie is focused more on the overall story of a broad mission like as if looking down at the entire chess board, rather than following just one piece.Bottom-line: This was an enjoyable movie, and I do feel well-articulated a valuable point about the importance of protecting our cultural achievements in the face of evil who would either highjack that history or destroy it.  I feel like it was well-acted in part because none of the actors seemed like they were there to steal scenes, but rather play their parts more subtly and just respect the history.  You could follow the story just fine contrary to what people have said.

As reported by Wikipedia, ""The Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program under the Civil Affairs and Military Government Sections of the Allied armies was established in 1943 to help protect cultural property in war areas during and after World War II. The group of about 400 service members and civilians worked with military forces to safeguard historic and cultural monuments from war damage, and as the conflict came to a close, to find and return works of art and other items of cultural importance that had been stolen by the Nazis or hidden for safekeeping.  Many of the men and women of the MFAA, also known as Monuments Men, went on to have prolific careers. Largely art historians and museum personnel, they had formative roles in the growth of many of the United States' greatest cultural institutions, including the National Gallery of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the New York City Ballet, as well as in museums and other institutions in Europe.""Though there appears to have been a great deal of artistic license, kudos to Clooney for being a force in bringing this monumental tale to the screen!  In the film, as explained by Carl Kozlowski of the Catholic News Agency,""an art professor named Frank Stokes [played by Clooney]... is recruited by President Franklin D. Roosevelt himself to organize a team of American art experts to recapture classic European art that was stolen by the Nazis....the two works that our heroes are most in awe of and expend the most effort towards are the altarpiece from the Cathedral at Ghent and Michelangelo's sculpture of the 'Madonna and Child.'""One drawback of the film is that it unnecessarily wonders whether art is worth more than a human life.

There are also some bits of humor thrown in to break up some of the slow movie parts between the desperate searches for the art.The true story itself is interesting enough but unfortunately the pacing of the movie makes it hard to keep you interested all the way through as the long stretches of very little going on almost ruin an otherwise great story with great actors.Still though it is worth a watch at 3.5 stars.",3,An ok tribute to a true story 3.5 stars,1400716800,"05 22, 2014",2014,1127,"['Monument', 'Men', 'several', 'experts', 'art', 'field', 'are', 'tasked', 'rescue', 'art', 'masterpieces', 'Nazi', 'thieves', 'return', 'owners.Based', 'true', 'story', 'attempts', 'rescue', 'art', 'Germans', 'looted', 'innocent', 'victims', 'WWII', 'movie', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'including', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'others', 'Blanchett', 'was', 'notable', 'standout', 'Claire', 'Simone', 'museum', 'curator', 'Paris', 'who', 'kept', 'records', 'things', 'Nazi', 'took.The', 'movie', 'move', 'bit', 'slowly', 'mostly', 'war', 'action', 'most', 'movie', 'design', 'assume', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'action', 'really', ""n't"", 'main', 'focus', 'movie', 'are', 'also', 'bits', 'humor', 'thrown', 'break', 'up', 'slow', 'movie', 'parts', 'desperate', 'searches', 'art.The', 'true', 'story', 'interesting', 'enough', 'unfortunately', 'pacing', 'movie', 'hard', 'keep', 'interested', 'way', 'long', 'stretches', 'very', 'little', 'going', 'almost', 'ruin', 'otherwise', 'great', 'story', 'great', 'actors.Still', 'watch', '3.5', 'stars']",N/A

1658896,AQCD1307TM93R,B00DL48BM6,katarinaism,"[0, 0]","Although Monuments Men is a WWII film based on real events, there's definitely a lot of artistic liberties taken.  That said, it details a part of history that often gets overlooked, so that in and of itself made it a worthwhile watch. In short, Clooney's character George Stout is a museum curator in New York who is asked by the President to put together a team of art experts (the title's Monuments Men), who are to travel to Europe and rescue stolen art before it can be destroyed by the Nazis. The characters are fictionalized versions, but the premise is based on fact.Acting-wise, there's a lot of monologues by Clooney's character, George Stout, which are probably the most memorable lines in the film.  Stout does a lot of proselytizing on the importance of art, but the speeches (particularly those towards the beginning of the film) felt a little forced and not quite earned, as it slowed the pace and didn't give the action and drama enough time to build.  The film's tone doesn't seem quite as bleak and serious as a film about WWII should, and at times felt too light--I wondered if this was intentional, as it made me as a viewer feel uncomfortable that a WWII film didn't feel uncomfortable enough.  Clooney's ""Monuments Men"" is a WWII film sort of in the same vein as Inglorious Basterds at least in its tone, but doesn't quite accomplish the storytelling Tarantino was able to pull off.  Partly at fault was the music, which was very upbeat.  But there are plenty of tragedies in the film, both on the small and large scale, that brought viewers back to the reality of what occurred.  As another side note, Cate Blanchett plays a French art expert who helps out the Monuments Men--Matt Damon's character in particular-- and also has a romance with him as well.  Blanchett's onscreen presence is commanding, but she struggles with the French accent throughout the film which was hard to get over.My main qualm with the film was that the plot skips around a lot, and it was difficult to really follow what was happening; it sort of played out as a series of scenes that didn't quite add up to a coherent story, although it was attempted. The lack of continuity made it hard to build the tension and the characters fully, but the excellent cast did their best and kept the film entertaining.",3,"A lot of action, but not much plot",1401235200,"05 28, 2014",2014,2306,"['Monuments', 'Men', 'WWII', 'film', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'definitely', 'lot', 'artistic', 'liberties', 'taken', 'said', 'details', 'part', 'history', 'often', 'overlooked', 'made', 'worthwhile', 'watch', 'short', 'Clooney', 'character', 'George', 'Stout', 'museum', 'curator', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'asked', 'President', 'put', 'together', 'team', 'art', 'experts', 'title', 'Monuments', 'Men', 'who', 'are', 'travel', 'Europe', 'rescue', 'stolen', 'art', 'can', 'be', 'destroyed', 'Nazis', 'characters', 'are', 'fictionalized', 'versions', 'premise', 'based', 'fact.Acting-wise', 'lot', 'monologues', 'Clooney', 'character', 'George', 'Stout', 'are', 'probably', 'most', 'memorable', 'lines', 'film', 'Stout', 'lot', 'proselytizing', 'importance', 'art', 'speeches', 'particularly', 'towards', 'beginning', 'film', 'felt', 'little', 'forced', 'not', 'quite', 'earned', 'slowed', 'pace', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'action', 'drama', 'enough', 'time', 'build', 'film', 'tone', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'bleak', 'serious', 'film', 'WWII', 'should', 'times', 'felt', 'too', 'light', 'wondered', 'was', 'intentional', 'made', 'viewer', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'WWII', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'enough', 'Clooney', 'Monuments', 'Men', 'WWII', 'film', 'sort', 'same', 'vein', 'Inglorious', 'Basterds', 'least', 'tone', ""n't"", 'quite', 'accomplish', 'storytelling', 'Tarantino', 'was', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'Partly', 'fault', 'was', 'music', 'was', 'very', 'upbeat', 'are', 'plenty', 'tragedies', 'film', 'small', 'large', 'scale', 'brought', 'viewers', 'back', 'reality', 'what', 'occurred', 'side', 'note', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'French', 'art', 'expert', 'who', 'out', 'Monuments', 'Men', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'character', 'particular', 'also', 'romance', 'as', 'well', 'Blanchett', 'onscreen', 'presence', 'commanding', 'French', 'accent', 'film', 'was', 'hard', 'get', 'over.My', 'main', 'qualm', 'film', 'was', 'plot', 'lot', 'was', 'difficult', 'really', 'follow', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'sort', 'played', 'out', 'series', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'add', 'up', 'coherent', 'story', 'was', 'attempted', 'lack', 'continuity', 'made', 'hard', 'build', 'tension', 'characters', 'fully', 'excellent', 'cast', 'did', 'best', 'kept', 'film', 'entertaining']",N/A

It is based on true events, so, we don't know how much is historically accurate, but. . .As WWII is coming to an end, Clooney pushes for some way to help save the art from being destroyed in the conflicts.  Roosevelt allows him to pull together a team of men to go to the battlefront and see what they can do to preserve the art that is left.  Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, and a few others welcome the invitation.  Although Murray and Goodman are not young whippersnappers, they hold their ground in the movie.  Cate Blanchette plays a great part as a German who is fed up with the Nazis and their thievery of the art.

1658933,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00DL48BM6,Mark Turner,"[3, 3]","We live in a throw away society, a world where everything is expendable and ready to be tossed aside once we've finished with it. Kids today seem only interested in themselves and what's going on in the present, never caring what happened before they were born. The saddest part of this is the fact that in being this way they never expose themselves to some of the greatest things in the world, everything from classic novels to pieces of art that have survived centuries. With any luck a few of them will watch THE MONUMENTS MEN and consider doing so.George Clooney stars as Frank Stokes, a military officer in World War II who presents a case to President Roosevelt about the famous works found in museums in Europe. In this presentation he shows Roosevelt famous pieces of art that have gone missing, supposedly taken by Hitler to be put on display when he wins the war in a specially built structure. That is if he doesn't damage them first or if the allies don't damage them while fighting battles from one town to the next. Stokes request is that a special select group of men work to save these pieces of art before they are all destroyed. Given the go ahead, he assembles his team.The team is small. There aren't that many people qualified or willing to be a part. Each has their own role to play in helping with this seemingly impossible task. Included in the group are James Granger (Matt Damon), Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), Walter Garfield (John Goodman), Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin), Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban) and Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville). These are the Monuments men, the elite group that sets out to fulfill the task Stokes has set forth. Granger is sent undercover to find out as much information as he can concerning the whereabouts of artwork stolen in France. The rest are split into teams and sent searching for other various artifacts.Using various methods they accumulate enough knowledge that they discover a pattern used in the transport of these works of art. It appears that each location on the map they point out with the clues presented there are underground mines where the art has been stored, at least in part. As the troops move forward, the team accompanies them in an attempt to fulfill their mission. Placing their lives in danger, not all will come home, but each will play his part in this truly historic mission.This gives you the basic idea of what the movie is about. What it doesn't do is show the admiration these men had for not just the task at hand but the items they were sent to save. While some might find a Rembrandt of a museum quality piece of artwork in a foreign church boring, these men look upon each with reverence and respect. The military might see their job as unworthy of their efforts but a twist results in them finding more than they bargained for.Based on the true story of this team the movie offers it all. There is plenty of camaraderie among the team, an affection that develops between them as they move forward. There is the awe that each one inspires with the items they find. There is humor in various moments where things can be light hearted. And there is tragedy as some fall to the enemy.What makes this movie important though is to consider what it was they actually accomplished. To think that some of these pieces might have disappeared (which some actually did) makes their story one of success where few thought it could happen. That they were able to rescue as much as they did is an amazing feat and one that should be lauded. I found it amazing that it took this long for their story to be told.The movie offers not just great entertainment but a piece of history that all should be made aware of. It's a film that young people should see to realize that there was a world out there before they were born and that many things they take for granted could simply have not been there if not for the efforts of people like this. Ipads, Ipods and Facebook are all great things but not near as great as what these people saved. It would be nice to know that at least a few people in the world appreciate the work that they did. Hopefully young people will find enough interest to watch this movie and feel a bit of that.",4,THE IMPORTANCE OF HISTORY,1400630400,"05 21, 2014",2014,4224,"['live', 'throw', 'away', 'society', 'world', 'where', 'everything', 'expendable', 'ready', 'be', 'tossed', 'aside', ""'ve"", 'finished', 'Kids', 'today', 'seem', 'only', 'interested', 'what', 'going', 'present', 'never', 'caring', 'what', 'happened', 'were', 'born', 'saddest', 'part', 'fact', 'being', 'way', 'never', 'expose', 'greatest', 'things', 'world', 'everything', 'classic', 'novels', 'pieces', 'art', 'have', 'survived', 'centuries', 'luck', 'few', 'will', 'watch', 'THE', 'MONUMENTS', 'MEN', 'consider', 'doing', 'so.George', 'Clooney', 'Frank', 'Stokes', 'military', 'officer', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'who', 'case', 'President', 'Roosevelt', 'famous', 'works', 'found', 'museums', 'Europe', 'presentation', 'Roosevelt', 'famous', 'pieces', 'art', 'have', 'gone', 'missing', 'supposedly', 'taken', 'Hitler', 'be', 'put', 'display', 'when', 'war', 'specially', 'built', 'structure', ""n't"", 'damage', 'first', 'allies', 'do', ""n't"", 'damage', 'fighting', 'battles', 'one', 'town', 'next', 'Stokes', 'request', 'special', 'select', 'group', 'men', 'work', 'save', 'pieces', 'art', 'are', 'destroyed', 'Given', 'go', 'ahead', 'team.The', 'team', 'small', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'people', 'qualified', 'willing', 'be', 'part', 'own', 'role', 'play', 'helping', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'task', 'Included', 'group', 'are', 'James', 'Granger', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Richard', 'Campbell', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Walter', 'Garfield', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'Clermont', 'Jean', 'Dujardin', 'Preston', 'Savitz', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'Donald', 'Jeffries', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'are', 'Monuments', 'men', 'elite', 'group', 'out', 'fulfill', 'task', 'Stokes', 'set', 'forth', 'Granger', 'sent', 'undercover', 'find', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'information', 'can', 'concerning', 'whereabouts', 'artwork', 'stolen', 'France', 'rest', 'are', 'split', 'teams', 'sent', 'searching', 'other', 'various', 'artifacts.Using', 'various', 'methods', 'accumulate', 'enough', 'knowledge', 'discover', 'pattern', 'used', 'transport', 'works', 'art', 'location', 'map', 'point', 'out', 'clues', 'presented', 'are', 'underground', 'mines', 'where', 'art', 'been', 'stored', 'least', 'part', 'troops', 'move', 'forward', 'team', 'attempt', 'fulfill', 'mission', 'Placing', 'lives', 'danger', 'not', 'will', 'come', 'home', 'will', 'play', 'part', 'truly', 'historic', 'mission.This', 'basic', 'idea', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'What', ""n't"", 'do', 'show', 'admiration', 'men', 'had', 'not', 'just', 'task', 'hand', 'items', 'were', 'sent', 'save', 'might', 'find', 'Rembrandt', 'museum', 'quality', 'piece', 'artwork', 'foreign', 'church', 'boring', 'men', 'look', 'reverence', 'respect', 'military', 'might', 'see', 'job', 'unworthy', 'efforts', 'twist', 'results', 'finding', 'more', 'bargained', 'for.Based', 'true', 'story', 'team', 'movie', 'plenty', 'camaraderie', 'team', 'affection', 'move', 'forward', 'awe', 'one', 'items', 'find', 'humor', 'various', 'moments', 'where', 'things', 'can', 'be', 'light', 'hearted', 'tragedy', 'fall', 'enemy.What', 'movie', 'important', 'though', 'consider', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'accomplished', 'think', 'pieces', 'might', 'have', 'disappeared', 'actually', 'did', 'story', 'one', 'success', 'where', 'few', 'thought', 'could', 'happen', 'were', 'able', 'rescue', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'amazing', 'feat', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'lauded', 'found', 'amazing', 'took', 'long', 'story', 'be', 'told.The', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'great', 'entertainment', 'piece', 'history', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'aware', 'film', 'young', 'people', 'should', 'see', 'realize', 'was', 'world', 'there', 'were', 'born', 'many', 'things', 'take', 'granted', 'could', 'simply', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'there', 'not', 'efforts', 'people', 'Ipads', 'Ipods', 'Facebook', 'are', 'great', 'things', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'what', 'people', 'saved', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'know', 'least', 'few', 'people', 'world', 'appreciate', 'work', 'did', 'Hopefully', 'young', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'enough', 'interest', 'watch', 'movie', 'feel', 'bit']",N/A

The second group of potential viewers seek a hard-core, battleground, historically correct ""Private Ryan""- type of war presentation that bears repeated viewings.  This DVD falls somewhere in the middle of these two groups of expectations, leaving the viewer a bit disillusioned.""Wind talkers""Windtalkers [Blu-ray], or ""Band of Brothers"" are two examples of the latter group that are harsh, mostly accurate depictions of twentieth century warfare.  There are unpleasant events, death & dying, abuse and all the really rough stuff that actually occurs in war amidst the action in these shows. ""Stalingrad""Stalingrad(Russian, English Subtitled), and ""Dresden""Dresdenare examples of the first group where young, ""beautiful"" people meet and find ""love"" during the carnage (with a bit of poetry thrown in), and true love ""reigns supreme"" ultimately.Give me ""Downfall"" (Hitler's last days in the bunker)Downfall, every time!  I was excited when I first saw the preview for ""Monuments Men"" figuring with Clooney involved there would be big money put into the production, and it would be great!

I last saw him at the Eric Clapton CrossroadsCrossroads: Eric Clapton Guitar Festival 2007concert as the emcee, and as always, he is magnificent in that show, and this one as well.  I adored the scenes with him in this show, and when he says, ""Heil Hitler"" at one point; it becomes the most memorable moment to me.  Damon is pretty much always good as well.

It describes the formation of an army unit that was created specifically to search for and recover priceless art stolen from the Jewish people by the German soldiers.A six man team called the Monuments Men is formed to undertake this mission. The team is led by Frank Stokes into France to begin their search. While in France the unit meets Claire Simone who is a French museum curator. She is being forced against her will to cooperate with Nazi officers like Viktor Stahl to steal priceless works of art.At this point in the war the Nazis are being pushed back and on their way out are looting and destroying as much as possible. The Monuments Men are able to uncover the locations of some of some of the art work on their own. They turn to Claire Simone for her assistance which she is initially reluctant to give. With her guidance the Monuments Men are able to uncover a huge cache of stolen art work in a castle and then find a map leading the group to a mine that contained thousands upon thousands of art pieces and more macabre items such as golden teeth pulled from the mouths of Nazi concentration camp victims.Another problem is encountered by the Monument's Men  when it is discovered they must compete with the Soviet Army as well in their searches. The Soviet Army assumes that they are entitled to the priceless art work as some sort of war reparations because of their massive number of casualties. In one of the final missions in the film a mine is found in Austria containing great numbers of the stolen pieces of art. The Monuments Men are able to sneak these pieces out right under the noses of the Soviet Army,including the priceless Madonna and Child sculpture by Michelangelo which held significant importance to the group because they lost one of their own in a failed attempt to prevent it from being stolen.The monuments Men made great headway in recovering the artwork.

It may not be the most exciting or cohesive World War II film ever made, but it is intelligent, superbly acted, and deeply moving in all the appropriate places.Clooney heads the cast as Frank Stokes, an art historian who leads the effort to find paintings and sculptures stolen by the Nazis and return them to their rightful owners. The art experts he recruits are played by Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Hugh Bonneville, and Bob Balaban; also in the cast is Cate Blanchett as a Parisian museum curator who provides Damon with invaluable aid at a crucial moment. None of these actors has a particularly large or colorful part, but individually and together they give &#34;The Monuments Men&#34; an impressive sheen of professionalism. Murray, Goodman, and Balaban are particularly enjoyable, all providing wry comic relief.&#34;The Monuments Men&#34; is necessarily an episodic story as the art experts split up to track different artistic treasures. Cumulatively, however, it is a moving story celebrating the achievements of civilization and the need to protect them from monsters.

He rounds up many of his old buddies and sets us on a journey as WW II draws to a close.  A true story, adapted from Robert Edsel and Bret Witter's book, ""The Monuments Men"" headed here by Frank Stokes (Clooney) are on a mission to save the millions of master artworks that Hitler stole from Europe.  His troop of older, out of shape art experts (Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Hugh Bonneville and Bob Balaban) spread out across the continent searching for the art as Allied forces now have Hitler retreating back to Germany.That fact alone had me scratching my head.  These guys have no transportation, little tactical support and no combat experience.  Yet Stokes breaks them up into 2 man teams and says, go boys.  The preservation of the world's greatest artworks is all on you.  The cast make the best of the situation.  One of the more interesting set ups is left a bit laboring.  Damon's character, James Granger, is dispatched alone to Paris where he finds a French clerical aid who was forced by the Nazis to catalog art taken from French museums, churches and private citizens.  Claire (Cate Blanchett), at first refuses to help believing that the Americans will just take the art back to their country.  As she queries of Granger, ""Are you here to steal our stolen art?""  It would have been more interesting if Granger's character wasn't so married with kids and was available to Claire's personal needs.What Clooney has done is make a pretty darn good traditional Hollywood movie.  One that would have been cheered 40 or 50 years ago.  I'm reminded of a similar film in texture, with Steven Spielberg's ""War Horse"" from 2011.

I grew up under these people, and so did Clooney, Murray, Rifkin and Goodman, so they should know better.An example is the &#34;Live fire drill&#34; where Clooney's watching the men in supposedly basic training in a live fire drill. They're crawling in the trench, Goodman stands up while an instructor's firing a carbine over their heads and just walks out, unaware that they're firing live ammo. In reality of course they have signs everywhere warning the soldiers to not raise their heads, that it was a live fire drill. There are other examples but that's one.There are no great scenes in the movie, no believable battle. The German's are miserably portrayed as &#34;evil Nazis&#34;, sort of like in Inglorious Bastards, although granted this wasn't quite as bad as that. This wasn't a &#34;terrible&#34; movie. And there were moments I found interesting and entertaining. But not many.If I had to do it over again I'd wait for it to come out as a rental and I would have rented it. I bought it because I assumed with the cast it couldn't possibly be a dud. I assumed wrong.If you liked movies like &#34;Flyboys&#34; and &#34;Inglorious Bastards&#34; then you'll like this. Of course you'll probably like a cartoon at that point so that's not saying much. But if you liked &#34;Band of Brothers&#34;,  and &#34;Saving Private Ryan&#34;, then you probably aren't going to like this.Rent it. Don't buy it. Its worth a rent just to see the story unfold as it is based on a true story. But if you buy it, you'll regret it.

1658987,A2BPVQ1VUE4JKQ,B00DL48BM6,"Obxboy ""ed_faver""","[0, 0]","THE MONUMENTS MEN is getting a three-star review from me because of Amazon's very favorable pricing ($12.99US) for a BD/DVD/Digital product that offers a 4K BD. When the release of George Clooney's latest directorial effort was pushed from  a MAJOR HOLIDAY RELEASE! to the traditional dumping ground of early winter, I was quite disappointed. The early trailers showed a picture with promise. The promise is not delivered in the film.Based in fact, THE MONUMENTS MEN follows analogs of real-life artists (who work in a range of visual arts) and art historians as they scour Europe in the waning days of WWII, attempting to recover art treasures stolen by German troops. The Nazi high command, seeing the end before them, have ordered the destruction of the artwork, in what can only be explained as an act of spite over the Allied defeat of the &#34;Thousand Year Reich.&#34;In a brief prologue, the mission is established and the film then proceeds to spend all of 15-30 seconds recruiting each character into the military. We barely get to see anddigest what these guys do in civilian life before being whisked to England and the start of strictly by-the-numbers storytelling. Two major characters perish. The death of each is telegraphed well before they expire. Matt Damon's character is separated from the troupe for most of the film so he can play out a lifeless flirtation with an art expert (Cate Blanchett) who has posed as a collaborator while working for the French Underground so she can...ah, forget it. It amounts to nothing. The film is further hobbled by Alexandre Desplat's musical score which can best be described as 'aural Xanax.' It belonged in a 50s Disney film set by the ole watering hole in deep summer. Ugh. As with ARGO, the end credits are filled with photos of the actual Monuments Men working in the environments depicted in the film. Whereas ARGO had me on the edge of my seat over an event whose outcome I knew well, THE MONUMENTS MEN had me fighting to keep my eyes open. Perhps Clooney would have better served audiences by making a documentary of the real Monuments Men, a group of heroes well past draft or fighting age who served toenrich our minds, hearts, and souls. This feature is a monument to a missed opportunity.I end as I began: I wanted a sample of 4K home video and this was exceptionally well-priced.

1658994,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00DL48BM6,Paul Allaer,"[5, 8]","""The Monuments Men"" (2014 release; 118 min.) brings the story, ""based on true events"" we are reminded at the beginning of the movie, of 8 men, tasked by President Roosevelt himself, to try and protect and/or recover the troves of art looted or threatened to be looted by the Germans during WWII. As the movie opens, we are in Ghent, Belgium, where Jan van Eyk's Altarpiece is being dismantled and whisked away. The scenery shifts back to the US where Lt. Frank Stokes (played by George Clooney) is putting together his team. There is the architect (played by Bill Murray), the sculptor (played by John Goodman), etc. etc. Once they get to Europe they split up and head out to various areas (Belgium, France, Germany). In a parallel story, we also get to know Claire (played by Cate Blanchett), a Parisian secretary working for the Nazis but secretly keeping track of everything. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: this movie is very much driven by (a labor of love for) George Clooney, as he co-wrote, co-produced and directed this (his first since 2011's excellent ""The Ides of March"", and his 5th overall). Second, notwithstanding what I just wrote, the move is an ensemble performance of mostly all-stars. Besides the ones I've already mentioned, there is also Matt Damon, Jean Dujardin (he of ""The Artist"" a few years back) and the always reliable Bob Balaban, just to name those. Third, even though this is NOT an 'action' war movie in any way, there are nevertheless a number of impressive looking production scenes, with a cast of hundreds, as Clooney is trying to recreate the chaos that existed in the latter phases of WWII. Fourth, if you don't like art or history, save yourself the trouble as more than likely you will not enjoy this movie. Besides the search for the Van Eyk Altarpiece, the other artifact that is a major plot point in the movie is Michelangelo's sculpture of Madonna and Child, from Bruges, Belgium. AS it happens, I grew up in Belgium (went to HS in Bruges, no less), and have seen both these artifacts, but had no idea about their perils during WWII until I saw this movie. Last but certainly not least, there is a fantastic orchestral soundtrack to the movie, composed by Alexandre Desplat. Bottom line: this movie is definitely not for everyone, but if you do enjoy a historical drama with a heavy dose of art, you cannot go wrong with this. At one point in the movie, Hitler signs a decree that if he is killed, all, as in ALL, of the looted art works are to be destroyed. Clooney's men get wind of that, prompting one of them to comment ""Now we have to hope nobody kills Hitler. I thought I'd never say that"", ha!I went to see the movie here in Cincinnati at a late matinee today. Imagine my surprise when it turned out this particular screening was absolutely PACKED! I never expected that. I enjoyed ""The Monuments Men"" more than I had anticipated, truth be told. This is a solid historical drama that gave me some insights on WWII, and in particular the preservation/recovery of art in WWII, which I didn't have before.

Except in this film the seven guys are all out to save the art treasures that may be lost during WWII. This film is really a nice try,  but it does not entertain most of the time. It is up and down and at times felt like the script was being written on the fly.George Clooney is asked and in essence suggests that he set up a group to save the world's treasures before they are lost forever. He reigns up Matt Damon, Bob Balaban, John Goodman, Bill Murray, Hugh Bonneville and Jean Dujardi, and they are all somehow involved in art history. They all become soldiers in search of German-pilfered paintings and statues. Not many in the armed Forces have an appreciation of art. If it is a choice of killing Germans in a church or saving art in that church, the art loses.The saving grace in this film is Cate Blanchett. Playing a secretary to the German high rank. She is able to help the group looking for the art and knows where to look for it. A romance with one of the art historian soldiers seems far fetched, but, then, some romance needed to enter the fray. Clooney played his usual sauve debonair self, but it seems to be wearing thin. Maybe he should leave the writing to someone else.

Also, the character development was poor, so an audience is less engaged.  Still, the historical significance is important enough that it is worth watching just to enlighten yourself about what transpired during WWII beside the the genocide of Jews, the madness of Hitler, getting in bed with the fiend Stalin, etc. I think that this movie is one perspective of the massive effort that went into protecting works of art across war-torn Europe & Italy.What is less conveyed in the movie is that Hitler fancied himself an artist & studied art.  He despised works by modernists like Picasso and ordered them removed and destroyed. Hildebrand Gurlitt, was one art dealer on assignment to the Nazis, who was supposed to obtain the works that Hitler wanted destroyed.  He kept them instead & left thousands of these works to his only son who hoarded them in secret in two apartments in Germany.  In keeping them, it has not been established any were purchased since there are no receipts (claimed they burned up).  The heirs to Jewish owners have already made claims.  The hoard was discovered & created a worldwide furor. Cornelius died recently & willed the entire lot to a museum. The case is ongoing, but underscores the massive task with which the Monuments Men were beset since there were other players involved in hoarding looted art aside from the uniformed Nazi troops.So while the perspective of this movie is limited to primarily American efforts, there were other forces at play to keep & hoard purloined art & valuables that are and were unknown for decades & may never be known.  This movie depicts the altruistic motives by Roosevelt & the Monuments Men to prevent the scorched earth policy of withdrawing Nazi troops from being implemented.

I mean really. Unfortunately, Laura and I came away from this one rather disappointed.The premise of this one can be summed up pretty simply. World War II is winding down; the Germans know they're losing so they set out to destroy as much of the world's great art as they can before they go. Only one thing stands in their way: motley bunch of aging artists. Dramatics ensue from there.On the positive side, the film does a great job of portraying the importance of the period of history we're talking about. A thousand years of human art and culture really is on the line. Other reviewers complain about the protagonist's pontifications but this is the whole point of the film. The Nazi's weren't just out to destroy the Jews or rule the world. If they were going down they wanted to take as much of the world with them as they could no matter the price. This story is the ultimate example of ""play by my rules or I'll take my ball and go home."" So all those prolonged speeches aren't in the way of the real action of this war movie, they are in fact its only reason for being.To the negative, as a connected narrative this movie was just hacked to bits. It could have made a meticulous and moving 6-hour mini-series but cut down to movie size the whole thing is a disconnected mess. There are, at various points, three distinct story lines but the relationships between them are unclear then suddenly they're all slammed together in a barely sensical manner. Further, the movie suffers from Hollywood over-drama just for the sake of drama. It's almost as if they tried to make an action flick out of a story that wasn't one.In summary, sadly disappointed. Those looking for a movie about a war... won't really get one. Those looking for a moving portrayal of an important historical event won't get what they want either. The whole thing is at times sentimental but never really manages that either. It's almost as if the movie tried to be 10 things at once and never really accomplished any of them with any deftness. Quite a shame, really.PS: It is always my endeavor to provide helpful reviews. If you find my review helpful then great!

Zwick,"[1, 2]","**1/2There&#8217;s something almost refreshingly old-fashioned about &#8220;The Monuments Men,&#8221; one of those Very Important Pictures that Hollywood used to produce with such abundance in its heyday. It&#8217;s one of those World War II pictures in which a motley group of strangers is recruited by the United States Army to carry out a mission behind enemy lines. Dubbed the Monuments Men, this group of art experts was assigned the task of rescuing some of the world&#8217;s greatest art masterpieces from the grasping hands of the Nazis who were busily absconding with the works with the intention of displaying them in a museum of their own after the war.Lt. Frank Stokes, who spearheaded the mission, is portrayed by George Clooney, while the men he recruits are played by Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bib Balaban, Dimitri Leonidas and Hugh Bonneville (&#8220;Downton Abbey&#8221;). Cate Blanchett co-stars as a curator who is also a Resistance fighter working for the French Underground, and who is initially suspicious of the Monuments Men&#8217;s motives for rounding up the treasures.The movie is interesting enough as an unusual slice of history, I suppose, but the screenplay by Clooney and Grant Heslov, based on the book by Robert M. Edsel, never finds a way to make this true life tale come alive as drama. The characters are dull and under-developed, and, as a consequence, we find ourselves strangely uninterested in their back stories and unmoved by their fates. There is also way too much emphasis placed on the comical and the sentimental, and the movie comes replete with a gratingly frivolous score that seems woefully inappropriate to the subject at hand.Despite the all-star cast, the movie is weighed down by over-earnest acting, with Murray and Balaban seemingly on hand mainly for the comic relief they provide.Clooney has directed the film with hollow competence, and there&#8217;s some discussion about whether or not lives should be risked for the sake of inanimate objects, no matter how valuable, but it&#8217;s hard to make anything particularly memorable out of a story where the artwork has more personality than the players.",2,Fails to do justice to its story,1401580800,"06 1, 2014",2014,2189,"['**1/2There', '8217', 'something', 'almost', 'refreshingly', 'old-fashioned', '8220', 'Monuments', 'Men', '8221', 'one', 'Very', 'Important', 'Hollywood', 'used', 'produce', 'such', 'abundance', 'heyday', '8217', 'one', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'pictures', 'motley', 'group', 'strangers', 'recruited', 'United', 'States', 'Army', 'carry', 'out', 'mission', 'enemy', 'lines', 'Dubbed', 'Monuments', 'Men', 'group', 'art', 'experts', 'was', 'assigned', 'task', 'rescuing', 'world', '8217', 'greatest', 'art', 'masterpieces', 'grasping', 'hands', 'Nazis', 'who', 'were', 'busily', 'absconding', 'works', 'intention', 'displaying', 'museum', 'own', 'war.Lt', 'Frank', 'Stokes', 'who', 'spearheaded', 'mission', 'portrayed', 'George', 'Clooney', 'men', 'are', 'played', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Jean', 'Dujardin', 'Bib', 'Balaban', 'Dimitri', 'Leonidas', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', '8220', 'Downton', 'Abbey', '8221', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'co-stars', 'curator', 'who', 'also', 'Resistance', 'fighter', 'working', 'French', 'Underground', 'who', 'initially', 'suspicious', 'Monuments', 'Men', '8217', 'motives', 'rounding', 'up', 'treasures.The', 'movie', 'interesting', 'enough', 'unusual', 'slice', 'history', 'suppose', 'screenplay', 'Clooney', 'Grant', 'Heslov', 'based', 'book', 'Robert', 'M.', 'Edsel', 'never', 'way', 'make', 'true', 'life', 'tale', 'come', 'alive', 'drama', 'characters', 'are', 'dull', 'under-developed', 'consequence', 'find', 'strangely', 'uninterested', 'back', 'stories', 'unmoved', 'fates', 'also', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'emphasis', 'placed', 'comical', 'sentimental', 'movie', 'replete', 'gratingly', 'frivolous', 'score', 'woefully', 'inappropriate', 'subject', 'all-star', 'cast', 'movie', 'weighed', 'down', 'over-earnest', 'acting', 'Murray', 'Balaban', 'seemingly', 'hand', 'mainly', 'comic', 'relief', 'provide.Clooney', 'directed', 'film', 'hollow', 'competence', 'there', '8217', 'discussion', 'not', 'lives', 'should', 'be', 'risked', 'sake', 'inanimate', 'objects', 'matter', 'how', 'valuable', '8217', 's', 'hard', 'make', 'anything', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'story', 'where', 'artwork', 'more', 'personality', 'players']",N/A

On the one hand, it has a tremendous cast and features some of my favorite actors, but reviews have been generally negative. I eventually chose to make up my own mind.I'm still not sure if that was a good decision.The movie is based on a true story, and tells the tale of how a small group of men were charged with the task of recovering artwork stolen by the Nazi's during World War II. I'm tired of stories about Nazi's, but I have a lot of respect for people who fought and still fight for our freedom. Art should be for everyone and I had not heard this story before, so I have to admit that I had high hopes for the movie.Nobody from the talented cast dominated the story. This was a true ensemble piece with screen time being shared. We are shown a recruiting stage, a planning stage, and then the attempted execution of those plans. Unfortunately, the drama doesn't really build in an effective way. In fact, I'm not certain what the movie was trying to be. There were frequent moments of comedy, interspersed with mystery, brief action, and adventure elements. With all of these important works of art at stake, I somehow failed to be completely invested in the story.It's hard to pinpoint why it fell flat for me. I rather enjoyed the performances of the principal actors, but I didn't feel much tension during the search, or triumph when works of art were recovered.The closing credits showed photographs of the real heroes who were involved in the mission 70 years ago.The most memorable character was James Granger (Matt Damon), who interacted in an important way with Parisian museum curator, Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett), to uncover vital information for the mission. Blanchett's character was based on Rose Valland.The Monuments Men is an important and heroic story which meanders along without ever becoming riveting.

1659072,A2GS6XMWDUA4KG,B00DL48BM6,T. Briggs,"[1, 1]","The Monuments Men &#8211;Some films are about characters and the actions that happen to them or the actions they cause to happen.  Other films are about actions and the characters that cause them or upon whom the action is directed.  Thus MASH was about the men and women who ran a battlefield hospital and Full Metal Jacket was about the effect of the Vietnam War on every human it touched.  Both were excellent films.  It&#8217;s rare to find a film that has both fully developed characters playing against some significant action.  Godzilla falls into this trap &#8211; great action but one dimensional characters.One would expect, then that the Monuments Men would be about the men who saved the art of Western Civilization.  You&#8217;d be wrong.  One would also expect if you take all our favorite male actors and put them in a film you could have a really great film.  Again you&#8217;d be wrong.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I really enjoyed the Monuments Men.  I&#8217;m just saying it&#8217;s not a very good film and there is no theory of film making in which a bad film cannot be an entertaining film.  Sometimes film should be just simple entertainment and in that this succeeds nicely.I got the feeling that the writer&#8217;s meeting went something like this:  &#8220;A scene where the priests are taking down the altar fresco.  A scene where the French admins spat in the wine glass of the German officer before serving him wine.  A boot camp scene where they make John Goodman do an obstacle course.  And after they got a bunch of scenes thought up and on paper they got a screenwriter to sew all the pieces together into a film.  So what I&#8217;m saying is that the cast is excellent, the sets and costume perfectly period, though the musical score uninspired the lighting superb.  The script just wasn&#8217;t better than the sum of its scenes and the direction seemed to be lacking.  And it&#8217;s a shame because the director, George Clooney, is one of America&#8217;s favorite human beings.  But I almost got the feeling this was, for him a love story, a very personal story somehow, and that means he may have been too much in love with the idea of this film than the film itself.One scene lifted straight out of Indian Jones and National Treasure is the now clich&eacute; scene where they&#8217;re looking for treasure, enter a dark mine, turn on a light and voila gold as far as the eye can see.  That was Hitler&#8217;s gold.  If you were curious as to whatever happened to Hitler&#8217;s gold you would be disappointed.  Another room contained barrels full of gold nuggets.  They were the dental fillings of dead Jews.  It wouldn&#8217;t have taken much to tell us what happened to all that gold and it would have made the movie just a wee tighter.  But this film is chock full of missed opportunities like that and yet it was still a truly entertaining work because each of the pieces was well thought out.There was just nothing really holding it all together.  As such the film was neither about the monuments or the men that saved it.  That doesn&#8217;t make it any less enjoyable.  And since it does reveal a bit of history of which most Americans aren&#8217;t aware they should be proud of, it&#8217;s got great value by virtue of that alone.  It&#8217;s just not a very good movie.

They are met by people who don't want to help. those that do, and those that are skeptical. The group divides up as our plot divides into subplots.

1659082,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B00DL48BM6,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[0, 0]","&#8220;The Monuments Men&#8221; is based on a true story, though the screenplay has veered off in terms of authenticity. It&#8217;s a tale of rescue &#8212; not of human beings, but of treasure. Adolf Hitler, an art fancier, had dreams of establishing the Fuhrer Museum, a massive structure intended to exhibit art masterpieces stolen from museums and private collectors. The war is winding down, and there is danger that these masterpieces, scattered to various locations in Europe, will be either destroyed as the Allied invasion intensifies or lost forever. Intelligence has discovered that Hitler will order the destruction of this art if Germany&#8217;s defeat is inevitable.A group of art historians, museum curators and professors, most well beyond fighting age, is assigned to locate these works and make sure they are protected and returned to their rightful owners. Under the leadership of Frank Stokes (George Clooney), the team arrives in Europe and the members spread out to track down various leads.James Granger (Matt Damon) heads for Paris, where he looks up the imprisoned Claire Simon (Cate Blanchett), believed to be a Nazi collaborator. She is suspicious of Granger&#8217;s motives, fearing the art will never be returned. The other team members (Bill Murray, Hugh Bonneville, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban) pursue leads that take them to Belgium and within Germany itself, where battles are still raging. Sam Epstein (Dimitri Leonidas), an enlisted soldier who speaks German, joins them as translator.Though &#8220;The Monuments Men&#8221; is a decent movie, it fails to come together on a number of levels. The original art task force consisted of 350 people from several nations, which makes sense considering the scope of the task. Films traditionally take dramatic license, but believing that six men could manage this massive undertaking is a stretch.The tone, too, is odd. There are humorous bits sprinkled throughout, but they seem out of place because of serious life-death issues and an underlying gravitas that director Clooney brings to the picture. A speech given by his character hammers home the importance of preserving art as the history of a people.Star power is in abundance, but none of the actors except Ms. Blanchett truly shines. Hers is a well written role, and we understand her dedication to the art, her hatred of the Nazis, and her suspicion of the art &#8220;rescuers.&#8221; Clooney attempts to give each of the male leads a good scene or two, but never properly exploits them.The picture has an authentic look and feel, with the assorted military equipment, uniforms, weapons, and even a few limited battle scenes, but this is all window dressing that can&#8217;t mask the movie&#8217;s flaws.The film is reminiscent of such 1960&#8217;s war pictures as &#8220;Guns of Navarone,&#8221; &#8220;The Dirty Dozen,&#8221; and &#8220;The Great Escape,&#8221; in which a small group of men must overcome overwhelming odds to accomplish a near-impossible task. With less emphasis on action and more on detective work as time runs out, &#8220;The Monuments Men&#8221; never achieves the excitement of a war movie, and makes ferreting out the rare masterpieces seem methodical but unimaginative.Rated PG-13, &#8220;The Monuments Men&#8221; tells a story not generally known and raises the question of whether human life should be sacrificed to locate and save art, however priceless.

1659088,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00DL48BM6,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 4]","George Clooney regularly uses his clout as one of the most bankable movie stars to write, produce and/or direct more interesting, more challenging projects. This practice has created an impressive group of films that keeps his fans happy and eagerly anticipating his next works.Well, 'next' is &#34;The Monuments Men&#34; about a group of men commissioned o save the world's leading artworks from Hitler's war machine and the dictator's voracious appetite to take everything the world has to offer as his own.&#34;Monuments&#34; was originally scheduled to be released last December, in prime Awards competition season, ready to compete with the Best of the Best. Them the studio abruptly changed the release date to February. Hmmmmmmm. That is NEVER a good sign. But the studio PR machine began to spin a good tale; Clooney wanted and needed more time to finish the polish, the effects on the film. It worked. It convinced me.Now, after watching &#34;Monuments&#34;, I see the correct phrase should be &#34;They fooled me.&#34;Studios do not change release dates for films they have confidence in. They don't move films out of Awards competition if it has a chance of winning an Oscar.&#34;Monuments&#34; is not a bad film, but it is a mediocre film. Given he cast and crew involved, it is also a disappointment.Clooney, morphing into a late-career Clark Gable, plays Frank Stokes, the architect of the mission , the leader of the seven American men, beyond their prime to fight, tasked with heading to France and Germany to save thousands of artworks from Hitler in the final days of the war. He rounds the men up and they head to France. They soon split up and follow different leads about different pieces of art before meeting up again, trying to stay one step ahead of the Germans, who are trying to destroy everything in their path as they retreat, and one step ahead of the Russians, determined to sweep everything they find into the Communist machine.Each character gets a brief introduction and each makes a reference or a joke about someone else, giving us the indication they have a history together, but the relationships are assumed, not illustrated. Then, they begin working on the plan to save artworks by splitting up. This serves to create an episodic storyline, concentrating on smaller groups and does nothing to help us get to know any of the characters in anything more than a superficial way.Because the film doesn't really create characters, they simply 'are', we don't really get to know them. And this makes us care less about them. As the groups split up, chasing specific masterpieces, they encounter danger, but the result is surprisingly suspense free. When the danger surfaces, your attention is held but because you are waiting for something to happen, something to move you, something to cause you to sit on the edge of your seat, when this doesn't happen, you begin to lose interest.The lack of character development is a shame because Clooney is a talented writer/director and he is a good actor. But the characters regard each other much like the cast of an &#34;Ocean's&#34; film, all jokes and kidding. In &#34;Monuments&#34;, there is a definite feeling these characters are an extension of Danny Ocean and his crew pulling off another heist. This almost seems to be a sequel, or a sequel created by a less accomplished writer/director, who just assumes you know what you need to know about the characters.It is also a shame because Clooney has rounded up a pretty terrific cast. Matt Damon plays James Granger, a restorationist enlisted to go to Paris and meet with Claire Simon (Cate Blanchett), a French woman who worked with the Germans to catalog the artwork they stole. These two characters are the centerpiece of the film and they actually have a few moments throughout to establish a relationship. Bill Murray plays Richard Campbell, an architect from Chicago, who gets paired off with Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban), a stage director. John Goodman's Walter Garfield is teamed with Jean Dujardin's Jean Claude Clermont. Hugh Bonneville plays Donald Jeffries, a disgraced British officer given a second chance with this new assignment.The lack of suspense is particularly evident in a few scenes. Late in the film, the story becomes a game of cat and mouse; the Americans are trying to stay ahead of both the Germans and the Russians, each for their own, very different reasons. As each of the three groups begins crisscrossing Germany, we watch, but the filmmakers fail to engage us and we simply don't feel the suspense. At one point, they discover a barrel filled with gold fillings. The characters who make the discovery seem shocked when they realize what it means, but they don't feel the horror that we now know. Maybe they didn't know about the extent of the death camps. But if that is the case, why mention it at all. There is a confrontation with an SS officer, an officer who was involved in an earlier confrontation with one of the stars. But when he is confronted, there is simply nothing there, nothing to make use feel suspense or horror.And because we don't really feel any suspense, watching the film becomes akin to watching a documentary on the History Channel. One of those documentaries filled with reenactments.Check out John Frankenheimer's 1964 film &#34;The Train&#34; starring Burt Lancaster, Paul Scofield and Jeanne Moreau.

I didn't know George Clooney had directed it, but I figured he was responsible for it. And I like nearly everything he did. (The Men Who Stare at Goatswas brilliant, though not much like the book;Up in the Airwas an appropriate social commentary, as wasGood Night And Good Luck.Then the film was hyped; I saw ads for it frequently.Then John Goodman for whose acting I'd all but die; Matt Damon, Bill Murray, even Jean Dujardin, whom I'd last seen inThe Artist.And based on a true story! GLORIOUS!Okay, Hitler wasn't a nice guy. There aren't many people who challenge that. That he was a narcissist and Nazism had become a religion dedicated to that narcissism is, ultimately, the reason so many were--justifiably--sentenced to death at Nuremburg. That was one of the underlying themes of the film; Hitler had issued orders that if he dies, most of  the most treasured art works of the Western world, Michelangelo's ""Madonna and Child,"" the alter piece from Ghent Cathedral in Belgium, were to be destroyed.BUT...there was a goblin in the background. A Soviet officer (sorry, I can't find the name of the actor who had no lines, just an occasional appearance.) was closing on the Americans who were collecting those art works. It seems that Stalin felt that the Soviet losses were so great that the USSR was entitled to some compensation, i.e., the art.Well, if you look at the history of WW2, we Yanks bless ourselves for the loss of some 404,000--whose sacrifice I'm NOT minimizing here. But the USSR lost up to an incredible 28 million over the period of the same war. So, while the film minimized, almost made a comic opera, out of the Soviet claim, I think there was more merit to it than to make a joke of it.(For those who think I'm minimizing that sacrifice, my dad was a WW2 vet; I have his picture at the WW2 Memorial taken a year nearly to the day before he died.)Indeed, after the Americans had taken the countless, priceless pieces of art, the Clooney character commented that ""we'd left something behind for the Russians."" And the camera pans to the US flag over the salt mine were they'd found some of the most valuable of the missing art works. And some of the audience clapped with glee...Perhaps more important, I'm accustomed to--and proud of--Mr. Clooney's ""social commentary."" I'd hoped that maybe--just maybe--this film was going to comment on what had happened in Iraq: because there was no plans for the occupation of that country--the merger of the Tigris and Euphrates are the birthplace of Western civilization--many of the art and cultural works reminiscent of that birth were looted and no longer exist, a cultural catastrophe of what we learn little.In any case, I don't begrudge Clooney. And I still like the sentiment of the film. The acting was, of course, great. The set was outstanding. But the story left too much out...there's so much more could have been done with it and wasn't.As I summarized to my spouse as we left the theatre in which we saw it, ""It' was more like a TV movie."" And, as it turns out, the next day, yesterday, a major film critic, said something similar.Enjoy it.

Without knowing a lot about the background of this movie the previews made it seem much different than it really was.  I thought I was going to watch an action-packed drama about how a group of untraditional soldiers (i.e., architects, professors, etc&#8230;) fought against the Nazi&#8217;s to save some of the world&#8217;s most precious art collections.  As it turns out the movie took place nearing the end of the war (while the Germans were in retreat) and was much more mellow and light-humored than I had anticipated.  It didn&#8217;t make it a bad movie&#8212;just not what I had expected.Positives: it had some funny parts, had a strong cast, was based off true events, and was entertaining.Negatives: not a great deal of action, the music was a bit much for my taste (it gave it kind of a theme park ride effect), and the tension was lacking (it didn&#8217;t draw me into the story as much as I would have liked).Overall I felt that the story was a great one that needed to be told, but I felt that there could have been improvements made to the film to deliver the film&#8217;s message much more effectively.

1659101,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00DL48BM6,Turfseer,"[4, 12]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'Monuments Men' is based on the true life team assembled during World War II, of museum directors, curators and art historians, assigned to save pieces of art before they were destroyed by the Nazis. According to the article, 'How Accurate is Monuments Men?', featured in Slate Magazine online, the original task of what was to become MFAA (Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives), was to protect historical buildings and not recover works of art. The film is only very loosely based on the true historical events so the question arises, has Mr. George Clooney successfully adapted the story to the silver screen, so that it works dramatically? The answer, unfortunately, is no.'Monuments Men' would have worked much better as a documentary but Clooney was determined to turn this into a rip-roaring action-adventure flick with a few comic interludes. The problem of course is that there is no central antagonist throughout the film. The nature of the mission was that it occurred in different locales and at different times, hence the narrative had to be episodic in nature. So we're introduced to one villain after another--and once each one is disposed of, we move on to the next.'Monuments Men' begins with Frank Stokes (Clooney) assembling his crackerjack team of art experts who must undergo basic training, before they're thrust into combat. It's sort of like 'The Dirty Dozen' with the characters being much more low-key and with little panache. Matt Damon as James Granger is assigned to learn as much as he can from Paris curator Claire Simone (a convincing Cate Blanchett), who kept a journal of all the art work stolen by Viktor Stahl, a Nazi official, who she was forced to work with prior to the German retreat (there is an unlikely scene where Stahl fires his pistol at Claire, as she watches trains loaded with the stolen art work, leave for Germany, from the Paris train station).Later, team members Richard Campbell (Bill Murray) and Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban), track Stahl down who is disguised as a farmer. Murray and Balaban manage to mine a few laughs as the hapless Stahl is unable to explain away how Rothschild property markings appear on the back of all the paintings he has on the walls of the villa he's staying at. Stahl is then promptly taken into custody.The film also covers the deaths of two team members who are killed in combat. One of the British members, Donald Jeffries, is killed at a Belgian church, as he attempts to prevent one of the Nazis from stealing the famed Michelangelo statute 'Madonna and Child' (the recovery of that particular piece along with the Van Eyck altarpiece, is the central focus of the film's narrative). A French member, Jean Claude Clermont, is also killed when he's caught in the crossfire of a battle (Clermont is an entirely fictional character as there were no French military personnel assigned to the Monuments Men team).We shift back again to James Granger who still must convince Simone to provide information on the stolen artwork (she's miffed as she's now being held as a 'collaborator', despite her clear anti-Nazi sentiments). Granger shows her a copy of Hitler's 'Nero Decree' in which he ordered that ""all military, transportation, communications, industrial, and food supply facilities"" be destroyed. Historically, there was nothing about artwork being destroyed in the decree, but obviously, for dramatic purposes, Mr. Clooney added that in. This convinces Simone to finally help Granger and she provides him with her journal that contains all the names and original property owners of artwork stolen by the Nazis.By including artwork in the 'Nero Decree', (as mentioned in Slate Magazine), Historian Elizabeth Campbell Karlsgodt points out that this was inserted in order to move the plot forward; the Monuments men are seen ""racing against the Germans who are set now to destroy the art if Hitler can't have it."" Karlsgodt doesn't even believe that the Monuments Men even knew about the Nero Decree during their mission: ""The systematic destruction (as seen in the film) being carried out as a result of the Nero Decree never happened,"" she says. ""Nazis destroyed art that they considered degenerate, like Cubist, Surrealist, Expressionist paintings, and we know that they burned several thousand-- at least--paintings that they thought were actually toxic to the German spirit... (But) they didn't destroy the art they valued."" (This included Germanic art, and the Ghent Altarpiece depicted in the film, which Hitler considered to be an example of ""Aryan genius."")The rest of 'Monuments Men' feels rushed. The team uncovers the 'mother lode' of stolen artwork in a salt mine as well as gold from teeth extracted from Jews sent to the concentration camps. Later they find another mine where the Michelangelo's 'Madonna' is located. The drama is manufactured when they're forced to remove the stolen artwork (including the Madonna) just before the Soviets arrive in the occupation zone designated for them. In reality, the Monuments Men had plenty of time to remove the artwork from the cave--a matter of days and not hours, as depicted in the film.Clooney gets his last licks in as he interrogates the Nazi colonel responsible for stealing and destroying a good deal of the pilfered artwork. In the case of both Nazis and Monuments Men alike, they're only on for a short time and there's no opportunity for the film's scenarists to develop any of the characters.Karlsgodt feels that the film's focus on Michelangelo's 'Madonna' and the Ghent Altarpiece undermines the true significance of Hitler's plans and their connection to the Holocaust. Quoted in Slate Magazine, she remarks, ""It leaves out a really crucial aspect of this history. Hitler saw it as a key way to seize the assets of Jews. He was not only eliminating Jewish influence, he was also getting their art.""",2,"Clooney's episodic tale of WW II team of stolen art finders, fails to work dramatically",1393718400,"03 2,

1659103,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00DL48BM6,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[52, 66]","During WWII, there was a group of soldiers and civilians who scoured Europe in order to &#34;safeguard historic and cultural monuments from war damage, and as the conflict came to a close, to find and return works of art and other items of cultural importance that had been stolen&#34; (quote from Wikipedia). This was something that had never been done before in war; in the past it had almost always been &#34;to the victor belong the spoils.&#34; However, the Allies (not including Russia) realized that the preservation of art and culture was part of what they were fighting to protect. To make a better future, they wanted to save, protect, and preserve the past. Some of the undertakings of a few of the Monuments Men were told in the 2009 book THE MONUMENTS MEN and that book is what formed the basis for the movie THE MONUMENTS MEN.Directed and co-written by George Clooney, THE MONUMENTS MEN follows a group of artists as they travel through Europe in an attempt to save and protect works of art and return those pieces to their rightful owners. Clooney stars in the movie as Frank Stokes. Stokes petitions President Roosevelt to let him assemble a group of artists and scholars that will be sent to Europe to protect works of art, architecture, and items of historical importance from destruction and return stolen items to their rightful owners. He recruits his good friend James Granger (Matt Damon) to assist him with his efforts. Together the two men round up the rest of their troop: Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), Walter Garfield (John Goodman), Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban), Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville), and Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin). After going through basic training in England and arriving in France a month after D-Day, the group enlists Sam Epstein (Dimitri Leonidas), a German Jew who fled to America with his family as a child, to be their translator. The team splits off to different parts of the continent and while in Paris Granger meets Claire Simon (Cate Blanchett) who eventually provides him with key information to finding and retrieving lost artifacts. It all becomes a hunt against time as it becomes clear that Germany will lose the war, but the stakes are raised as the Russians refuse to return any stolen goods, claiming them as restitution for the twenty-million people the war cost them.The acting in the movie is well done. Clooney and Damon portray characters that seem similar to other characters they have played before. All the lead cast gets at least one big moment to shine in this piece. However, I was particularly impressed by Bob Balaban, Bill Murray, and Cate Blanchett. Balaban's Preston Savitz is the eldest member of the group and has a wonderful dry sense of humor. The pairing of Balaban and Bill Murray was genius. Murray also has a moving solo scene that illustrates once again that Murray isn't just a comic actor, but a fine dramatic one, too. Meanwhile, Blanchett fills her role with all kinds of mesmerizing actions and movements. She's a pure delight to watch.I enjoyed THE MONUMENTS MEN. Having read the book prior to seeing the film, I was surprised at how many of the stories from the book actually made it into the movie. There are some scenes that are added for dramatic effect. There are also certain events and people that have been condensed to make the story more cinematic, but overall the movie stays close to the source material. The one big thing I was surprised about were the names of the people in the movie: almost all of the major characters in THE MONUMENTS MEN are based upon real people, but for some reason they are given different names in the movie.The movie never steers away from the importance of the mission these men have undertaken. The audience is reminded of it several times by different characters throughout the film. However, the film also has a comic tone to it, which is somewhat surprising for a war movie. The comic tone doesn't take away from the seriousness of the subject matter, however. Nor does the film shy away from the real dangers of war. However, there are some who might find the dual comic-dramatic elements of the film to be confusing and, perhaps, even inappropriate. This shouldn't be the case: life is often tragic and comical at the same time. Tragedy and comedy might be opposites, but they are not mutually exclusive.Overall, THE MONUMENTS MEN is an entertaining film that brings to light an important aspect of WWII history that is often overlooked. It's lighthearted, but doesn't glass over the risk and tragedy of war and it's a great reminder that the past should be saved in order to make the future worth living.",4,Saving the Past to Enrich the Future,1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,4661,"['WWII', 'was', 'group', 'soldiers', 'civilians', 'who', 'scoured', 'Europe', 'order', '34', 'safeguard', 'historic', 'cultural', 'monuments', 'war', 'damage', 'conflict', 'came', 'close', 'find', 'return', 'works', 'art', 'other', 'items', 'cultural', 'importance', 'had', 'been', 'stolen', '34', 'quote', 'Wikipedia', 'was', 'something', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'done', 'war', 'past', 'had', 'almost', 'always', 'been', '34', 'victor', 'spoils.', '34', 'However', 'Allies', 'not', 'including', 'Russia', 'realized', 'preservation', 'art', 'culture', 'was', 'part', 'what', 'were', 'fighting', 'protect', 'make', 'better', 'future', 'wanted', 'save', 'protect', 'preserve', 'past', 'undertakings', 'few', 'Monuments', 'Men', 'were', 'told', '2009', 'book', 'THE', 'MONUMENTS', 'MEN', 'book', 'what', 'formed', 'basis', 'movie', 'THE', 'MONUMENTS', 'MEN.Directed', 'co-written', 'George', 'Clooney', 'THE', 'MONUMENTS', 'MEN', 'group', 'artists', 'travel', 'Europe', 'attempt', 'save', 'protect', 'works', 'art', 'return', 'pieces', 'rightful', 'owners', 'Clooney', 'movie', 'Frank', 'Stokes', 'Stokes', 'petitions', 'President', 'Roosevelt', 'let', 'assemble', 'group', 'artists', 'scholars', 'will', 'be', 'sent', 'Europe', 'protect', 'works', 'art', 'architecture', 'items', 'historical', 'importance', 'destruction', 'return', 'stolen', 'items', 'rightful', 'owners', 'good', 'friend', 'James', 'Granger', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'assist', 'efforts', 'Together', 'two', 'men', 'round', 'up', 'rest', 'troop', 'Richard', 'Campbell', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Walter', 'Garfield', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Preston', 'Savitz', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'Donald', 'Jeffries', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'Clermont', 'Jean', 'Dujardin', 'going', 'basic', 'training', 'England', 'arriving', 'France', 'month', 'D-Day', 'group', 'Sam', 'Epstein', 'Dimitri', 'Leonidas', 'German', 'Jew', 'who', 'fled', 'America', 'family', 'child', 'be', 'translator', 'team', 'different', 'parts', 'continent', 'Paris', 'Granger', 'Claire', 'Simon', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'who', 'eventually', 'key', 'information', 'finding', 'retrieving', 'lost', 'artifacts', 'hunt', 'time', 'clear', 'Germany', 'will', 'lose', 'war', 'stakes', 'are', 'raised', 'Russians', 'refuse', 'return', 'stolen', 'goods', 'claiming', 'restitution', 'twenty-million', 'people', 'war', 'cost', 'them.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'well', 'done', 'Clooney', 'Damon', 'portray', 'characters', 'seem', 'similar', 'other', 'characters', 'have', 'played', 'lead', 'cast', 'least', 'one', 'big', 'moment', 'shine', 'piece', 'However', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Balaban', 'Preston', 'Savitz', 'eldest', 'member', 'group', 'wonderful', 'dry', 'sense', 'humor', 'pairing', 'Balaban', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'was', 'genius', 'Murray', 'also', 'moving', 'solo', 'scene', 'once', 'again', 'Murray', ""n't"", 'just', 'comic', 'actor', 'fine', 'dramatic', 'one', 'too', 'Meanwhile', 'Blanchett', 'role', 'kinds', 'mesmerizing', 'actions', 'movements', 'pure', 'delight', 'watch.I', 'MONUMENTS', 'MEN', 'Having', 'read', 'book', 'prior', 'seeing', 'film', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'many', 'stories', 'book', 'actually', 'made', 'movie', 'are', 'scenes', 'are', 'added', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'are', 'also', 'certain', 'events', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'condensed', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'cinematic', 'movie', 'close', 'source', 'material', 'one', 'big', 'thing', 'was', 'surprised', 'were', 'names', 'people', 'movie', 'almost', 'major', 'characters', 'MONUMENTS', 'MEN', 'are', 'based', 'real', 'people', 'reason', 'are', 'given', 'different', 'names', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'never', 'away', 'importance', 'mission', 'men', 'have', 'undertaken', 'audience', 'reminded', 'several', 'times', 'different', 'characters', 'film', 'However', 'film', 'also', 'comic', 'tone', 'somewhat', 'surprising', 'war', 'movie', 'comic', 'tone', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'seriousness', 'subject', 'matter', 'however', 'film', 'shy', 'away', 'real', 'dangers', 'war', 'However', 'are', 'who', 'might', 'find', 'dual', 'comic-dramatic', 'elements', 'film', 'be', 'confusing', 'perhaps', 'even', 'inappropriate', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'case', 'life', 'often', 'tragic', 'comical', 'same', 'time', 'Tragedy', 'comedy', 'might', 'be', 'opposites', 'are', 'not', 'mutually', 'exclusive.Overall', 'MONUMENTS', 'MEN', 'entertaining', 'film', 'light', 'important', 'aspect', 'WWII', 'history', 'often', 'overlooked', 'lighthearted', ""n't"", 'glass', 'risk', 'tragedy', 'war', 'great', 'reminder', 'past', 'should', 'be', 'saved', 'order', 'make', 'future', 'living']",N/A

You analyze it, try to find the reason, and end up like a marble statue of indecision. That's how I felt with The Monuments Men.As far as the storyline, I had no idea that Hitler amassed such a monumental collection of the world's masterpieces while conquering Europe. When I initially saw the trailer for the movie, I thought it would be an interesting flick of war intrigue. To my horror, about half way through I kept fiddling with the stop button on my TV wanting to escape.I cannot put my finger on any one thing as to why this movie doesn't work. Since George Clooney and Matt Damon star in the film, maybe I was hoping for a WWII version of Oceans 11 where the gang steals back valuable artwork from the bad guys. There are great actors, but mediocre performances. Even George Clooney was a dud, like the landmine that barely sparks in one scene.The film lacks conflict and intrigue. Perhaps it's the script that is dull or poor direction. It jumps from scene to scene.The only thing that did ruffle my feathers were the Germans stealing, stashing, and destroying the masterpieces from great artists. As the war is ending, the team of men who are lovers of art, take on the task of finding, salvaging, and returning the stolen treasures.Of course, there are undertones of much more being destroyed than art. There is the terrible confiscation of Jewish property, even down to barrels full of gold fillings taken from the mouths of victims. It is a sobering reminder that more than art had been lost during the war, and perhaps we should care about human lives rather than a Rembrandt.Nevertheless, it is true that our greatest achievements as human beings should be preserved. Hitler wanted to conquer more than land and human lives, he wanted to conquer and own all of the art created by master artists of centuries past. Two men gave up their lives to preserve and reclaim the artwork. The only question left for the audience to ponder is whether the price of a human life is worth the preservation of a masterpiece.",3,No Masterpiece,1400889600,"05 24, 2014",2014,2128,"['Have', 'ever', 'had', 'feeling', 'something', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'can', 'not', 'put', 'finger', 'analyze', 'try', 'find', 'reason', 'end', 'up', 'marble', 'statue', 'indecision', 'how', 'felt', 'Monuments', 'Men.As', 'far', 'storyline', 'had', 'idea', 'Hitler', 'amassed', 'monumental', 'collection', 'world', 'masterpieces', 'conquering', 'Europe', 'When', 'initially', 'saw', 'trailer', 'movie', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'flick', 'war', 'intrigue', 'horror', 'way', 'kept', 'fiddling', 'stop', 'button', 'TV', 'wanting', 'escape.I', 'can', 'not', 'put', 'finger', 'one', 'thing', 'why', 'movie', ""n't"", 'work', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'star', 'film', 'maybe', 'was', 'hoping', 'WWII', 'version', '11', 'where', 'gang', 'steals', 'back', 'valuable', 'artwork', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'great', 'actors', 'mediocre', 'performances', 'Even', 'George', 'Clooney', 'was', 'dud', 'landmine', 'barely', 'one', 'scene.The', 'film', 'conflict', 'intrigue', 'Perhaps', 'script', 'dull', 'poor', 'direction', 'scene', 'scene.The', 'only', 'thing', 'did', 'ruffle', 'feathers', 'were', 'Germans', 'stealing', 'stashing', 'destroying', 'masterpieces', 'great', 'artists', 'war', 'ending', 'team', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'lovers', 'art', 'take', 'task', 'finding', 'salvaging', 'returning', 'stolen', 'treasures.Of', 'course', 'are', 'undertones', 'much', 'more', 'being', 'destroyed', 'art', 'terrible', 'confiscation', 'Jewish', 'property', 'even', 'down', 'barrels', 'full', 'gold', 'fillings', 'taken', 'mouths', 'victims', 'sobering', 'reminder', 'more', 'art', 'had', 'been', 'lost', 'war', 'perhaps', 'should', 'care', 'human', 'lives', 'rather', 'Rembrandt.Nevertheless', 'true', 'greatest', 'achievements', 'human', 'beings', 'should', 'be', 'preserved', 'Hitler', 'wanted', 'conquer', 'more', 'land', 'human', 'lives', 'wanted', 'conquer', 'own', 'art', 'created', 'master', 'artists', 'centuries', 'Two', 'men', 'gave', 'up', 'lives', 'preserve', 'reclaim', 'artwork', 'only', 'question', 'left', 'audience', 'ponder', 'price', 'human', 'life', 'preservation', 'masterpiece']",N/A

It was an interesting true story of courageous men saving priceless artwork that little pipsqueak dictator wanted for his own thousand year reign of the Reich in Europe and the world, but this one hour and 59 minute story dragged badly.  I also found the camerawork and lighting poor at times and it was hard to focus in night scenes to see which actors were in the scene. Cate Blanchett was mediocre and a lesser known actress could have handled the part easily.  Frankly, it's one of George Clooney's lesser works and I don't really think that they was anything that either he or the other actors or writers could have made better.

Almost all movies are excepting the works of Malick, Spike Jones, or Wes Anderson in American cinema.  Cliches are at drives Hollywood.  But Monuments Men went full board on the hokey.  And I get it.  Just like with Leatherheads sometimes George wants to make a movie in the classic Hollywood style.  But man he just hit some false notes with this flick.I for one was rather disappointed when the studio pulled the flick from the Christmas/Academy Awards season in late 2013.  Thought it was a damn travesty.  Then after I watched it I realized they just weren't going to sink more bad money trying to drum interest amongst Academy voters for the slim possibility of maybe one or two nominations in technical category.  Every year a studio does this with a flick.  Like Cruises' Valkyrie or the great underrated Shutter Island.Again, though I do love Clooney.  He's great in almost (almost being the emphasis here for the remainder of this sentence) any movie he's in.
