The problem is, although he is followed by a very loyal, if somewhat misfit crew, he's just not a very good pirate.  The reasons why his crew loves him becomes obvious as his kind heart and general over looking of everyone's faults, including his own, makes him a fun guy to be around.  Until he meets Darwin who informs him his ""parrot"" is not a parrot.  Envisioning awards of gold that will get him to the top in the pirate competition, Pirate Captain sets his sights on winning the scientist of the year award.  Unfortunatel, the queen envies his ""parrot"" and soon Pirate Captain is faced with a difficult decision that separates him from his crew and the parrot.  Then he has to redeem himself and save the parrot, while being saved himself.The story line is a wonderful lesson for kids and adults alike with lots of good, clean fun along the way.

But whereas Pirates! is great family viewing, it is somehow less appealing to adults that Chicken Run or Wallace and Grommet. A couple of obvious gags were not fully exploited; having Darwin plagiarize ""evolution"" from the Pirate Captain was a distinct possibility, or having the Pirate Captain fall in love with the ""obvious"" female crew member... these are twists which would've registered more with adults and which simply failed to materialize.

Glamorizing a particular type of criminal seemed odd to me when the trend started.That said, I really can't find any merit in this film.  It's very long and boring.  There's not enough plot to keep anyone's attention.  The scenes drag on and never really go anywhere.  There was one funny scene with a bathtub.  The rest are utter non-sense.Not to spoil it for anyone who chooses to waste their own time in this life... This movie is centered around the mushy emotional relationship of a crappy pirate and his crew.  That's why I say, ""really?""The captain is not a ferocious and cruel type, and he's not heroic and loyal, and he's not even the ridiculously focused on, emotional and values his relationship type.  He's worthless and this movie is in character with the captain.  Add to that, the characters are not funny, and the lines are not funny either.The adventure type scenes are too ridiculous to be exciting, and end up boring.  The queen's character is too bizarre to be entertaining.  The only value was clearly in the animation and claymation style of film making.  I think the queen's character was created just for the animators pleasure, but surely not the audience's.Wallace and Grommit's, ""the Wrong Trousers"", is the only film they've produced that I thought was aimed at and entertaining for the whole family.  The rest of their films always leaves me asking, who was this aimed at?  Too boring for adults and older kids, and often scenes too disturbing and frightening for the youngest viewers, but not the type of storyline that would appeal to youngsters anyhow.

I see so many cartoons that it is a joy to find one that truly appeals to both adults and children.  It is also fun to find one that isn't so dark.

His ship his falling apart, his crew is week and incompetent, his parrot is fat and in a society where the more feared you are the more important you are seen, The Pirate Captain is only worth 12 doubloons.  Still, The Pirate Captain is hopeful of becoming Pirate of the Year.  He applies and then sets off on an adventure to find a lot of booty.But he hits a snag when he meets Charles Darwin and finds out that his fat parrot is anything but a parrot, but is the long thought extinct Dodo Bird.  What happens next is pure hilarity.The Claymation process is astonishing and so much fun to watch, and the progression of story is great.  It never grows tired because each additional slice of storyline feels intended and fresh.  I couldn't stop laughing, and the visual gags are met each step of the way with smart humor.

Simon,"[2, 4]","Synopsis: In a pirate haven, just as the pirate captain is putting in his application for the Pirate of the Year award, assured by his crew that he's a shoo-in, three other contenders arrive that put his ""achievements"" to shame. So he sets out to board more ships in order to gain more gold. No luck. After four failed attempts, he boards a scientific expedition ship, headed by Charles Darwin (yes, that Darwin). Just as Darwin is about to be executed, he notices that the pirate's ""parrot"" is actually an extinct dodo and he convinces the captain to take it to London and apply for the Scientist of the Year Award, hoping that it will lead to riches. They do so and they stay at Darwin's home, where a trained chimp wearing a tuxedo and using cards with which to write messages does Darwin's bidding. Queen Victoria takes an odd interest in the rare fowl and that's as far as I'll go with the plot.This animated film is by the same folks that brought you Wallace and Grommit.

How could the people responsible forWallace & GromitandFlushed Awayhave produced this disaster?Let's start with the utterly unengaging hero, The Pirate Captain (That's his name not his title).  Utterly incompetent and a good deal less intelligent than the pet Dodo Bird he thinks is a parrot, The Captain (for short) is nevertheless beloved by his crew for no discernible reason other than the fact that he is willing to tolerate their own incompetence.  (They makeThe Pirates of Penzancelook like the undead pirates ofPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearlin comparison).The Captain's pirating life of beard growing, singing sea shanties, waving shiny cutlasses, futile attempts at gathering loot, and Ham Night is finally exposed to his own eyes as the laughingstock it is to real pirates by the sudden realization that he's never won and never will win the annual Pirate of the Year contest because winning is based on the amount of loot gathered, and he hasn't gathered any.  EVER.  However, the ridicule from other pirates provokes him into entering the contest again anyway, and what follows is the single most ineffective voyage in the history of piracy until he captures Charles Darwin who recognizes that Polly is a thought-to-be-extinct Dodo Bird and assures The Captain that Polly will be sufficient to win the Scientist of the Year contest and ""untold riches"".  Putting two and two together and coming up with five, The Captain allows himself to be conned into sailing for England, despite Queen Victoria's virulent hatred and prosecution of pirates where only Extremely Stupid Luck (The Captain isn't bright enough to have Dumb Luck.) saves him (and Polly) again and again from the ludicrous yet unfunny (hard to do but the movie makers manage) evil schemes of Charles Darwin and Queen Victoria (?).Though the occasional joke or running gag works, which earned it an extra star from me, this movie is mostly a collection of unfunny bits, mistimed jokes, inappropriate humor for children, forgotten plot elements (The reason one of the pirates is a woman badly disguised as a man?  Apparently none because nothing is ever done with it.), and over-the-top schemes (SPOILER ALERT It turns out that Queen Victoria wants the Dodo so that she and a stereotypical parody group of world leaders, including Napoleon and Uncle Sam, can cook and eat it....  END SPOILER ALERT) that will have you shaking your head in astonishment.  Somebody thought this was funny?  Somebody SOBER thought this was funny?  I'd be inclined to sympathize with Gideon Defoe over the way the screenwriter ruined his bookThe Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists: A Novel, except that it turns out he WAS the screenwriter so instead I'll be deleting all of his books from my Wish List.

Storyline was a roller coaster ride of viewer engagement with too much on the ho-hum side of the ride. Not in the same class as Vinton, Burton and the French animation studios. One example, and even the Wallace & Gromit productions have this weakness, is the faces and especially the eyes display a cut-out mode of sameness; almost as if they had a box of mass produced eyes and gave them to all the characters.The dialogue was contemporary and intelligent.

The Pirate Captain and his crew set off attacking ship after ship in search of gold. But when the Pirate Captain meets scientist Charles Darwin, the two have a misunderstanding about unlimited wealth causing the Pirate Captain to choose between riches and re-discovering the true meaning why people become pirates. Based off Gideon Defoe's novels, the adaptation is an 88 minute decent 3/5 stars.

This smart and funny animated claymation/CGI production from directors Peter Lord and Jeff Newitt, who also teamed up on ""Chicken Run"" (2000) and ""Flushed Away"" (2006), is a treat for anyone who loves a clever, good natured joke.That seems to be the pirate's biggest problem, their abiding trust and naivet&eacute; in an England beset by the Industrial Revolution, Darwinism and a mad Queen Victoria, who is representative of those with very rich appetites. Names are simple. The Pirate Captain, voiced by Hugh Grant - and you will never recognize him - longs to win the Pirate of the Year award, a feat that's defeated him for 20 years. His loyal crew - The Pirate with a Scarf a.k.a. No. 2, (Martin Freeman, ""Sherlock,"" ""The Hobbit""), The Albino Pirate (Anton Yelchin), The Surprisingly Curvaceous Pirate (a woman disguised as a man voiced by Ashley Jensen), The Pirate Who Likes Sunsets and Kittens (Al Roker), and The Pirate with Gout (Brendan Gleeson) - do their best to help. But it isn't until they run into the actual theory-of-evolution Darwin, voiced by David Tennant of ""Dr. Who,"" that they discover they might have a chance at winning something ... even if it means the sacrifice of something they love.Bright moments abound. I caught an appearance by The Elephant Man right off, but didn't see Jane Austen until the second go. I'll bet there's more I missed. Could Conan Doyle or Charles Dickens be in a scene somewhere, too?There's good crossover between the Blu-ray, 3D Blu-ray and DVD discs among the extras. A commentary with Lord, Newitt and film editor Justin Krish is loaded with information, but seems dull, particularly compared with onscreen antics. I suspect it's a result of the dry, British wit going Sahara on us. ""So You Want to be a Pirate"" is a hoot with the Pirate Captain hosting his own late-night TV show, guests included. Games include ""Mr. Bobo's Flash Card Challenge"" (Darwin's assistant, a monkey and another great character) and a DVD-ROM where kids can download activities and coloring pages on the DVD. There's an interactive game, ""Pirate Disquise Dress-Up,"" on the Blu-ray.Exclusive to Blu-ray is one of the best extras, an engaging making-of ""From Stop to Motion""; a featurette on ""Creating the Bath (tub) Chase Sequence""; and two short films from Peter Lord.Speaking of the Blu-ray - both picture and sound are reference quality GREAT. Color, depth, detail, contrast - it's all there for the HD connoisseur. The film is dialogue heavy, so most of the sound broadcasts front and center. It is also great; each voice - with accent - comes through clearly and distinctly. Comical effects abound, blending in perfectly. There's nothing to distract from the action.

Now that I've seen those same scenes in context in the movie I realize how funny they are.  And dumbing down the title from ""The Pirates! An Adventure with scientists"" to ""The Pirates!

However, the movie lacks two very important things; an interesting and not too predictable story and characters we should care more about.Gideon Defoe who wrote the screenplay based on his own book....didn't seem to capture the magic that is a feature film style animation. The movie seemed to play on the `emotions' of the lead character called The Pirate Captain as voiced by Hugh Grant (Noting Hill, Music & Lyrics), but it seems a little shallow in the `believability' part of this character. Hugh did a great job personifying an uptight, unaware and obviously persecuted pirate captain, but without the script it falls a little short.Some other amazing vocal performances came from David Tennant (Fright Night, Doctor Who) who performed the not yet famous Charles Darwin and a generously evil performance by the Queen of England as voiced by Imelda Staunton (Harry Potter: OOTP, Shakespeare In Love). Other funny performances came from Anton Yelchin (Star Trek, Fright Night) as an Albino Pirate and Jeremy Piven (Entourage, The Family Man) as Black Bellamy an ego driven pirate who always wins the Pirate of The Year Award!The sole quest of The Pirate Captain is to prove himself - after 75 attempts - that he can actually win The Pirate of the Year Award.....except he is not very bright, his crew is a literal band of misfits and he happens on a scientist (Darwin) that discovers his very own parrot is actually not a parrot but a Dodo Bird. Something thought to be extinct. Then the story shifts to being about making it on time to a Science fair. Yawn.There are some great bits - but not enough to justify the 90 minutes or film or even the 3-D. The movie would have been just as fine outside the 3-D marketing. The kids in the audience I was in were not as into the film as I thought they might be....so overall a nice family film but probably worth waiting for on cable or the DVD.I was disappointed but somewhat entertained.",3,Pirates - Fell A Little Short For Me,1335744000,"04 30, 2012",2012,2420,"['MOVIE', 'REVIEW', '28', 'Pirates', 'Band', 'Misfits', 'Well', 'love', 'Aardman', 'films', 'creators', 'Wallace', 'Grommit', 'directors', 'Peter', 'Lord', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'Chicken', 'Run', 'Jeff', 'Newitt', 'key', 'animator', 'Flushed', 'Away', 'made', 'visually', 'stunning', 'clay-mation', 'feature', 'filled', 'panoramic', 'views', 'old', 'London', 'Caribbean', 'open', 'sea', 'movie', 'got', 'talented', 'voice', 'cast', 'great', 'gags', 'are', 'short', 'snippets', 'slapstick', 'even', 'one-liners', 'are', 'quite', 'funny', 'However', 'movie', 'two', 'very', 'important', 'things', 'interesting', 'not', 'too', 'predictable', 'story', 'characters', 'should', 'care', 'more', 'about.Gideon', 'Defoe', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'based', 'own', 'book', '.did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'capture', 'magic', 'feature', 'film', 'style', 'animation', 'movie', 'seemed', 'play', 'emotions', 'lead', 'character', 'called', 'Pirate', 'Captain', 'voiced', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Noting', 'Hill', 'Music', 'Lyrics', 'little', 'shallow', 'believability', 'part', 'character', 'Hugh', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'personifying', 'uptight', 'unaware', 'obviously', 'persecuted', 'pirate', 'captain', 'script', 'little', 'short.Some', 'other', 'amazing', 'vocal', 'performances', 'came', 'David', 'Tennant', 'Fright', 'Night', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'who', 'performed', 'not', 'yet', 'famous', 'Charles', 'Darwin', 'generously', 'evil', 'performance', 'Queen', 'England', 'voiced', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'OOTP', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'Other', 'funny', 'performances', 'came', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Fright', 'Night', 'Albino', 'Pirate', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'Entourage', 'Family', 'Man', 'Black', 'Bellamy', 'ego', 'driven', 'pirate', 'who', 'always', 'Pirate', 'Year', 'Award', 'sole', 'quest', 'Pirate', 'Captain', 'prove', '75', 'attempts', 'can', 'actually', 'win', 'Pirate', 'Year', 'Award', 'not', 'very', 'bright', 'crew', 'literal', 'band', 'misfits', 'scientist', 'Darwin', 'very', 'own', 'parrot', 'actually', 'not', 'parrot', 'Dodo', 'Bird', 'Something', 'thought', 'be', 'extinct', 'Then', 'story', 'shifts', 'being', 'making', 'time', 'Science', 'fair', 'are', 'great', 'bits', 'not', 'enough', 'justify', '90', 'minutes', 'film', 'even', '3-D', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'fine', '3-D', 'marketing', 'kids', 'audience', 'was', 'were', 'not', 'film', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'overall', 'nice', 'family', 'film', 'probably', 'worth', 'waiting', 'cable', 'DVD.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'somewhat', 'entertained']",N/A

1323025,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0034G4P1W,Mark Turner,"[14, 19]","Pirates have become cool again with the trilogy of films made by Johnny Depp but those films might be just a tad too intense for the youngest of children. With that in mind the folks at Aardman studios, the stop motion group responsible for Wallace and Gromitt among other things, have come up with some pirates of their own. They've just been unleashed with this film.The story follows a group of pirates that aren't quite up to snuff in the pirate hierarchy. Sure they have the peg legs and eye patches, but this ragtag group just doesn't seem to pillage near as much as most. They're led by the Pirate Captain who does his best to keep his crew happy and content (hey, don't forget ham night!). But Pirate Captain has dreams of his own, of becoming the Pirate of the Year.The only problem is the amount of pirating he and his crew does. With Cutlass Liz and Black Bellamy always bringing in more booty they win the competition every year. Rather than allow him the chance to do better, the group always ridicules him as well.That could all change when Captain Pirate and his crew board a boat stocked with all sorts of stuffed animals and body parts. The boat belongs to Charles Darwin who's been seeking a special scientific discovery so that he can become the Scientist of the Year award back in London. He too has had a tuff time but when he sees Captain Pirate's parrot he recognizes it is not a parrot at all but the extinct dodo bird. Darwin convinces Captain Pirate to take him to London along with the bird where they will win all sorts of treasures for their discovery.Even though the queen has placed a bounty on the heads of every pirate to sail the seven seas the group heads for London. Once there Darwin attempts to steal the bird from Captain Pirate to claim the award for himself. He fails and Captain Pirate wins the award, stunned to find that it isn't booty at all but an award along with the chance for time with, of all people, the Queen! Darwin failed to mention the reward would be time spent with the woman of his dreams.The Queen also wants possession of the dodo bird for her private zoo but Captain Pirate doesn't give in easily. After discovering he is a pirate and nearly decapitating him, she stops and pardons him in the hopes he will turn over the bird. When she offers treasure as well, Captain Pirate sees the chance to return to Blood Island with more booty than anyone has ever claimed and win the prized Pirate of the Year award. But all doesn't go as planned, something that always seems the case with this group.The story may seem pretty well straight forward but in truth there is more beneath the obvious here. It's not just about Captain Pirate winning the award and gaining some self esteem. Instead the story is more about discovering who you really are and what is really important in life. For Captain Pirate that boils down to winning the award he's cherished for so long or remaining true to both Polly (the dodo bird) and his crew.As with all Aardman Studio films this one is chock full of sight gags that run from beginning to end. Each one may be a small portion of the film seen but they all will garner laughs from adults as well as children. They do a nice combination of jokes that older viewers will get but won't offend the young crowd.The stop motion animation is as always amazing. In a world where computer animation seems to have taken over, it's nice to see someone using this technique and not allowing it to fade away. Somehow just watching it makes you realize how creative and artistic it is in comparison.The final word about this film though is that it is truly entertaining. It's a movie that both young and old will enjoy and have fun with. Topping that off is the fact that it offers something that youngsters will not realize they are getting and that is a set of morals to accompany the tale. They'll learn that wanting something and doing anything for it at the sake of losing everything that is truly important isn't quite worth it. And for a movie to entertain and get that point across is truly an amazing feat. So hoist the rigging and set sale for the high seas with this film that the whole family can enjoy.",3,SHIVER ME TIMBERS!,1346112000,"08 28, 2012",2012,4191,"['Pirates', 'have', 'become', 'cool', 'again', 'trilogy', 'films', 'made', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'films', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'tad', 'too', 'intense', 'youngest', 'children', 'mind', 'folks', 'Aardman', 'studios', 'stop', 'motion', 'group', 'responsible', 'Wallace', 'Gromitt', 'other', 'things', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'pirates', 'own', ""'ve"", 'just', 'been', 'unleashed', 'film.The', 'story', 'group', 'pirates', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'up', 'snuff', 'pirate', 'hierarchy', 'Sure', 'have', 'peg', 'legs', 'eye', 'patches', 'ragtag', 'group', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'pillage', 'near', 'as', 'much', 'most', ""'re"", 'led', 'Pirate', 'Captain', 'who', 'best', 'keep', 'crew', 'happy', 'content', 'hey', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'ham', 'night', 'Pirate', 'Captain', 'dreams', 'own', 'becoming', 'Pirate', 'Year.The', 'only', 'problem', 'amount', 'pirating', 'crew', 'Cutlass', 'Liz', 'Black', 'Bellamy', 'always', 'bringing', 'more', 'booty', 'win', 'competition', 'year', 'Rather', 'allow', 'chance', 'do', 'better', 'group', 'always', 'well.That', 'could', 'all', 'change', 'when', 'Captain', 'Pirate', 'crew', 'board', 'boat', 'stocked', 'sorts', 'stuffed', 'animals', 'body', 'parts', 'boat', 'Charles', 'Darwin', 'who', 'been', 'seeking', 'special', 'scientific', 'discovery', 'so', 'can', 'become', 'Scientist', 'Year', 'award', 'back', 'London', 'too', 'had', 'tuff', 'time', 'when', 'Captain', 'Pirate', 'parrot', 'not', 'parrot', 'extinct', 'dodo', 'bird', 'Darwin', 'convinces', 'Captain', 'Pirate', 'take', 'London', 'bird', 'where', 'will', 'win', 'sorts', 'treasures', 'discovery.Even', 'queen', 'placed', 'bounty', 'heads', 'pirate', 'sail', 'seven', 'seas', 'group', 'London', 'Once', 'Darwin', 'attempts', 'steal', 'bird', 'Captain', 'Pirate', 'claim', 'award', 'Captain', 'Pirate', 'award', 'stunned', 'find', ""n't"", 'booty', 'award', 'chance', 'time', 'people', 'Queen', 'Darwin', 'failed', 'mention', 'reward', 'would', 'be', 'time', 'spent', 'woman', 'dreams.The', 'Queen', 'also', 'possession', 'dodo', 'bird', 'private', 'zoo', 'Captain', 'Pirate', ""n't"", 'give', 'easily', 'discovering', 'pirate', 'nearly', 'decapitating', 'pardons', 'hopes', 'will', 'turn', 'over', 'bird', 'When', 'treasure', 'as', 'well', 'Captain', 'Pirate', 'chance', 'return', 'Blood', 'Island', 'more', 'booty', 'anyone', 'ever', 'claimed', 'win', 'prized', 'Pirate', 'Year', 'award', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'planned', 'something', 'always', 'case', 'group.The', 'story', 'may', 'seem', 'pretty', 'well', 'straight', 'forward', 'truth', 'more', 'obvious', 'here', 'not', 'just', 'about', 'Captain', 'Pirate', 'winning', 'award', 'gaining', 'self', 'esteem', 'Instead', 'story', 'more', 'discovering', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'what', 'really', 'important', 'life', 'Captain', 'Pirate', 'down', 'winning', 'award', 'cherished', 'so', 'long', 'remaining', 'true', 'Polly', 'dodo', 'bird', 'crew.As', 'Aardman', 'Studio', 'films', 'one', 'chock', 'full', 'sight', 'gags', 'run', 'beginning', 'end', 'one', 'may', 'be', 'small', 'portion', 'film', 'seen', 'will', 'garner', 'laughs', 'adults', 'as', 'well', 'children', 'do', 'nice', 'combination', 'jokes', 'older', 'viewers', 'will', 'get', 'wo', ""n't"", 'offend', 'young', 'crowd.The', 'stop', 'motion', 'animation', 'always', 'amazing', 'world', 'where', 'computer', 'animation', 'have', 'taken', 'over', 'nice', 'see', 'someone', 'using', 'technique', 'not', 'allowing', 'fade', 'away', 'Somehow', 'just', 'watching', 'realize', 'how', 'creative', 'artistic', 'comparison.The', 'final', 'word', 'film', 'though', 'truly', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'young', 'old', 'will', 'enjoy', 'have', 'fun', 'Topping', 'off', 'fact', 'something', 'youngsters', 'will', 'not', 'realize', 'are', 'getting', 'set', 'morals', 'accompany', 'tale', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'wanting', 'something', 'doing', 'anything', 'sake', 'losing', 'everything', 'truly', 'important', ""n't"", 'quite', 'worth', 'movie', 'entertain', 'get', 'point', 'across', 'truly', 'amazing', 'feat', 'So', 'hoist', 'rigging', 'set', 'sale', 'high', 'seas', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy']",N/A

A few chuckles now and again, but nothing to appreciate more on a second viewing. I'm not a kid, so I can't speak with full authority on their potential enjoyment, but I would guess it would be low. All I know is that Wallace and Gromit and Chicken Run are fantastic fun every time, and this was disappointing.

1323068,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B0034G4P1W,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[4, 10]","As a big fan of Aardman Animations, I had high hopes for The Pirates! Band of Misfits.  Unfortunately, this film is more a bundle of misfires than anything else.  It's one of those films where, if you've seen the trailer, then you've already seen ninety percent of what's worth seeing in the film.Directed by Peter Lord and Jeff Newitt and written by Gideon Defoe, there's something missing from this film.  What's missing is Nick Park, who was writer and/or director on all of Aardman's best films, from the Wallace & Gromit and Creature Comforts short films to their feature films like The Curse of the Were-Rabbit and Chicken Run.  Park was also the missing element from Aardman's notably less successful films like Flushed Away and Arthur Christmas.  All of the humor and heart and cohesive consistency that Nick Park brings to his projects is absent here.  And boy does it show.The nominal plot centers around The Pirate Captain (that's his name, not his title) and his crew of misfits who sail the seas in an apparently nameless (one of many, many oversights in this film) ship in 1837 when Queen Victoria ruled the British Empire.  Ignoring for the moment the fact that the golden age of piracy actually ended a hundred and fifty years before this film is set, The Pirate Captain (Hugh Grant) is on a quest to win the coveted Pirate of the Year award, which goes to the pirate who accumulates the most plunder. His arch rivals in this endeavor are fellow pirate lords Black Bellamy (Jeremy Piven) and Cutlass Liz (Salma Hayek).  After a truly miserable run of pirating - boarding a leper ship, a ghost ship, and a ship of nudists among others, none of which have anything to plunder - The Pirate Captain ends up boarding the HMS Beagle where he encounters none other than Charles Darwin (David Tennant).  Darwin recognizes the pirates' parrot Polly as not being a parrot at all but instead a dodo, a bird that, thought by all to be long extinct, would be the zoological find of the century.  This turn of events takes the pirates to London where they run afoul of Queen Victoria (Imelda Staunton), ruler of the British empire with a sworn hatred of all things pirate.  Not to mention a taste for, shall we say, quite rare cuisine.The animation - mostly stop-action claymation with some CGI added in - is up to the usual high Aardman Animations standards.  But it's what's going on within the film and the characters that falls woefully short.  The best way I can describe Band of Misfits is that it's like listening to a stand-up comic whose timing is awful, who doesn't know his audience, and who now and then ends up forgetting the punch-line entirely.  I mean, you listen, and you know the jokes are _supposed_ to be funny, but the way they're delivered they're just... not. And also lacking is heart.  There's no real emotional depth or even substance to most of the characters, leaving them largely one-note jokes that wander aimlessly from scene to scene.  As an example of an undelivered punch-line, one of the crew - The Surprisingly Curvaceous Pirate - is obviously a woman pretending to be a man by wearing a fake beard.  But that's all there is.  Lord and Defoe never go anywhere with it; she's never revealed as a woman, she's never in a situation where her being a woman matters in any way, they just have her there as part of the crew, a one-note joke lacking a punch-line for the entire film.  Also wasted was Salma Hayek's Cutlass Liz who definitely catches one's interest - and eye - when she makes her sexy-and-dangerous entrance early in the film... only to pretty much disappear for the rest of the movie until the end when the Pirate of the Year winner is announced. The same goes for Jeremy Piven's Black Bellamy - big flashy whale of an entrance, then nothing to do for the rest of the movie.  And as for not knowing the audience, a lot of the jokes are Darwin/evolution jokes that are going to go right over the heads of any kids, who would seem to be the principle market for the film.  They also won't make the adults laugh either because they're executed so badly.As far as the 3D aspect goes, once again, the 3D here - as in so many recent releases - adds absolutely nothing to the film and amounts to a complete waste of money trying to make a mediocre film seem like more than it is.About the only positive thing I can say about Band of Misfits is that it was genuinely funny to not only see Queen Victoria cast as the villain but also to see her spring into flying ninja two-sword combat mode in the climactic battle scene.  It was also good to hear Brian Blessed's inimitable bass bellow as The Pirate King, even if he only had one scene to use it in. But these two things don't make up for the rest of the movie, not by a long shot.  Band of Misfits is definitely a missed fit on Aardman's part.  It's not as bad as Flushed Away was, but it's nowhere as good as any of the Nick Park films were.Recommended only for die-hard Aardman Animations fans and for anyone who's always wanted to see what Queen Victoria as an arch-villainess would be like.",3,Band of Misfits largely a bundle of misfires,1338940800,"06 6, 2012",2012,5086,"['big', 'fan', 'Aardman', 'Animations', 'had', 'high', 'hopes',

Feeling out of his depth, Pirate Captain decides to give it up but fate of course has other plans.Pirate Captain and his crew, together with naturalist Charles Darwin (David Tennant) find themselves heading to England, where the pirate-hating Queen Victoria dwells.
