Movie Mars listed, sold and shipped the wrong REGION DVD when they shipped this item.  When I contacted them they denied making the error and when I furnished them with their original description that stated the DVD would play in ALL regions... they conveniently never answered me again.  Thank God for Amazon...I brought the situation to them and they graciously refunded my money!  Be very aware that Movie Mars is a huge vendor both here and on eBay!  I inadvertently bought something from them from eBay this past weekend and am dreading the result. I will certainly bring it to the attention of eBay if anything goes wrong but I will NEVER again purchase anything from them after this encounter and after reading their poor reviews there as well!  Movie Mars is NOT a vendor Amazon should allow their customers to deal with.",1,Be VERY wary of DVD purchases from Movie Mars,1378339200,"09 5, 2013",2013,925,"['Shirley', 'Bassey', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'entertainers', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', 'see', 'DVD', 'Movie', 'Mars', 'listed', 'sold', 'shipped', 'wrong', 'REGION', 'DVD', 'when', 'shipped', 'item', 'When', 'contacted', 'denied', 'making', 'error', 'when', 'furnished', 'original', 'description', 'stated', 'DVD', 'would', 'play', 'ALL', 'regions', 'conveniently', 'never', 'answered', 'again', 'Thank', 'God', 'Amazon', 'brought', 'situation', 'graciously', 'refunded', 'money', 'Be', 'very', 'aware', 'Movie', 'Mars', 'huge', 'vendor', 'here', 'eBay', 'inadvertently', 'bought', 'something', 'eBay', 'past', 'weekend', 'am', 'dreading', 'result', 'will', 'certainly', 'bring', 'attention', 'eBay', 'anything', 'wrong', 'will', 'NEVER', 'again', 'purchase', 'anything', 'encounter', 'reading', 'poor', 'reviews', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'Movie', 'Mars', 'NOT', 'vendor', 'Amazon', 'should', 'allow', 'customers', 'deal']",N/A

Gallimore,"[17, 19]","This is a reasonably good concert, although I was at her 60th birthday concert (at the same time this concert was taped) and it was much better. That should have been released on DVD.The interruption of the behind the scenes material is obtrusive, and could have been refined to a separate section of the disc - or even placed on side B.It is inextricable to me why this is the only representative of Shirley on DVD.  This disc is all very well, but why not have some complete (unedited) concert releases, or the BBC TV series from the 1970s?This is a good start, but Shirley's artistry could, and should, be much better represented in this medium.",4,Shirley is Forever,972777600,"10 29, 2000",2000,648,"['reasonably', 'good', 'concert', 'was', '60th', 'birthday', 'concert', 'same', 'time', 'concert', 'was', 'taped', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'DVD.The', 'interruption', 'scenes', 'material', 'obtrusive', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'refined', 'separate', 'section', 'disc', 'even', 'placed', 'side', 'B.It', 'inextricable', 'why', 'only', 'representative', 'Shirley', 'DVD', 'disc', 'very', 'well', 'why', 'not', 'have', 'complete', 'unedited', 'concert', 'releases', 'BBC', 'TV', 'series', '1970s', 'good', 'start', 'Shirley', 'artistry', 'could', 'should', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'represented', 'medium']",N/A

Then her dresserwhining about she is stuck on one white dress that she keeps wearing and its in tatters.  All in All just a mess of a DVD.I see one place is asking about $184.00 for this DVD (New) well, I think I sold my copy to Amazon for $1.25Well, I see the price of this DVD as been lowered to it's worth.Larry Clark who has written the review from Amazon has completely lost his mind.  His review bares absolutely no resemblance to this DVD.  She performs at a Jewelers Convention in Belgium.  singing the same old crap.Pretending to loose a diamond earring that a jewelers jumps up and replaces on the spot.
