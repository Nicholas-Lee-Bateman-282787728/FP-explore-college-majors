400280,A3801HUY8KOMU0,6304087977,Abedsbrother,"[16, 16]","The following is from my review on this production which is posted on [...]I'm just getting the chance to dig into past Austen films, and I picked this up because Persuasion is, has been, and always will be, my favorite work by Jane Austen, and Anne Elliot my favorite Austen heroine. So it was with great anticipation that I popped the disc into my player.I wasn't disappointed, either. I knew there were bound to be some draw-backs, so I'll state them, and try not to be too thick about them. Anne Elliot is the most introverted of Austen's characters; she is the least talkative and the least witty. There are passages in the book where Anne says nothing - only her feelings are described. This works fine in print, but how to successfully transfer this to the big screen? Short of doing thoughtful voice overs (which would grow tedious over four hours) you're left with a long succession of shots where the heroine says little or nothing, and must communicate all by her facial expression. This can leave the feeling that the film is slow, and lacking in purpose. If you need a more overt style of Austen, then certainly this film is not for you; but if subdued is more your style, and you tend to pick up on unspoken 'vibes', this will fulfill all expectations.Anne Firbank (as Anne Elliot), is, thankfully, an actress whose face can convey much. She looked as I had always imagined Anne Elliot would look: not a knockout - Anne wasn't supposed to be the elegant one of the family - nor in her first youth - which is also highlighted occasionally by the lighting and make-up. What you see is someone who is very like Austen's character: someone whose appearance you might pass over once; but hear her speak, and look more closely, and she grows more attractive the better you know her. This is Anne Elliot, as brought to life by Anne Firbank.Captain Wentworth's portrayal is ably handled by Bryan Marshall. The bitterness is never apparently obvious (save at the concert scene); and, yes, I found it hard to believe he wound find Louisa Musgrove interesting as she was shown. But that is another point of Austen's book: he did not find her interesting, he TRIED to find her interesting, and, ultimately, failed (sigh of relief). So this, too, fits with Austen's original story.I especially liked the portrayal of Lady Russell, who I thought in the book was not portrayed as TRULY bad; this also comes out in this adaptation.So this is one film which closely followed the book; I could write much more about how faithfully everything was reproduced, but I'd run out of space here. Charles Musgrove remained one of the most buoyant characters (good fun), Mary the most annoying (I was dying to have her just shut up - but I had that feeling when I read the book, too), captains and the admiral I thought charming.The cinematography I thought a trifle stiff. There was little or practically no fade from one screen to another - perhaps this is due to it being a TV movie. One scene - CHOP! - the next scene, the actors enter from right, proceed left, and - CHOP! - another scene, where the same thing happens. This was the only part of the movie which I felt cheated me a little. A Low Budget has to show itself somewhere, I suppose.And, as I said earlier, if you like some pace to go with Jane Austen, don't bother with this one, as you'll find it way too slow. I enjoyed it enormously, though, as it brought a wealth of detail (the sets were richly elegant!) to an excellent adaptation of my favorite Austen novel. I highly recommend it!",5,Excellent adaptation...,1165708800,"12 10, 2006",2006,3541,"['following', 'review', 'production', 'posted', '[', ']', ""'m"", 'just', 'getting', 'chance', 'dig', 'past', 'Austen', 'films', 'picked', 'up', 'Persuasion', 'been', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'favorite', 'work', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'favorite', 'Austen', 'heroine', 'was', 'great', 'anticipation', 'popped', 'disc', 'player.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'either', 'knew', 'were', 'bound', 'be', 'draw-backs', ""'ll"", 'state', 'try', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'thick', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'most', 'introverted', 'Austen', 'characters', 'least', 'talkative', 'least', 'witty', 'are', 'passages', 'book', 'where', 'Anne', 'nothing', 'only', 'feelings', 'are', 'described', 'fine', 'print', 'how', 'successfully', 'transfer', 'big', 'screen', 'Short', 'doing', 'thoughtful', 'voice', 'overs', 'would', 'grow', 'tedious', 'four', 'hours', ""'re"", 'left', 'long', 'succession', 'shots', 'where', 'heroine', 'little', 'nothing', 'must', 'communicate', 'facial', 'expression', 'can', 'leave', 'feeling', 'film', 'slow', 'lacking', 'purpose', 'need', 'more', 'overt', 'style', 'Austen', 'then', 'certainly', 'film', 'not', 'subdued', 'more', 'style', 'tend', 'pick', 'up', 'unspoken', ""'vibes"", 'will', 'fulfill', 'expectations.Anne', 'Firbank', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'thankfully', 'actress', 'face', 'can', 'convey', 'much', 'looked', 'had', 'always', 'imagined', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'would', 'look', 'not', 'knockout', 'Anne', 'was', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'elegant', 'one', 'family', 'first', 'youth', 'also', 'highlighted', 'occasionally', 'lighting', 'make-up', 'What', 'see', 'someone', 'who', 'very', 'like', 'Austen', 'character', 'someone', 'appearance', 'might', 'pass', 'once', 'hear', 'speak', 'look', 'more', 'closely', 'more', 'attractive', 'better', 'know', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'brought', 'life', 'Anne', 'Firbank.Captain', 'Wentworth', 'portrayal', 'ably', 'handled', 'Bryan', 'Marshall', 'bitterness', 'never', 'apparently', 'obvious', 'save', 'concert', 'scene', 'yes', 'found', 'hard', 'believe', 'wound', 'find', 'Louisa', 'Musgrove', 'interesting', 'was', 'shown', 'point', 'Austen', 'book', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'interesting', 'TRIED', 'find', 'interesting', 'ultimately', 'failed', 'sigh', 'relief', 'So', 'too', 'Austen', 'original', 'story.I', 'especially', 'liked', 'portrayal', 'Lady', 'Russell', 'who', 'thought', 'book', 'was', 'not', 'portrayed', 'TRULY', 'bad', 'also', 'out', 'adaptation.So', 'one', 'film', 'closely', 'followed', 'book', 'could', 'write', 'much', 'more', 'how', 'faithfully', 'everything', 'was', 'reproduced', ""'d"", 'run', 'out', 'space', 'here', 'Charles', 'Musgrove', 'remained', 'one', 'most', 'buoyant', 'characters', 'good', 'fun', 'Mary', 'most', 'annoying', 'was', 'dying', 'have', 'just', 'shut', 'up', 'had', 'feeling', 'when', 'read', 'book', 'too', 'captains', 'admiral', 'thought', 'charming.The', 'cinematography', 'thought', 'trifle', 'stiff', 'was', 'little', 'practically', 'fade', 'one', 'screen', 'perhaps', 'due', 'being', 'TV', 'movie', 'One', 'scene', 'CHOP', 'next', 'scene', 'actors', 'enter', 'right', 'proceed', 'left', 'CHOP', 'scene', 'where', 'same', 'thing', 'was', 'only', 'part', 'movie', 'felt', 'cheated', 'little', 'Low', 'Budget', 'show', 'somewhere', 'suppose.And', 'said', 'earlier', 'like', 'pace', 'go', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'one', ""'ll"", 'find', 'way', 'too', 'slow', 'enjoyed', 'enormously', 'though', 'brought', 'wealth', 'detail', 'sets', 'were', 'richly', 'elegant', 'excellent', 'adaptation', 'favorite', 'Austen', 'novel', 'highly', 'recommend']",Persuasion VHS

It's very length is satisfying; it's about four hours in all, enough time for a little more shading of character and manner.  We see the Musgroves and Anne arriving at the inn at Lyme for example, and the character of Sir Walter is a little less obvious and hilarious, though equally narcissistic.  What is remarkable is how much alike the two versions are; they really both are very accurate adaptations.  And it's good to see the Italian concert scene as executed by different actors.  There are different production values of course, this version is much more cheaply done, perhaps that is why the sailors are in civvies throughout the show.  And this version does delve into the connection between Mrs. Smith and young Mr. Elliot, a connection which was entirely ignored in the film, but at least makes more sense than his chasing after his broke cousins for their money.  And if you're an afficionado you may notice that this Mrs. Smith entirely lacks the charm of the film one.  Lady Russell is also quite different, a sweet old lady, rather than a society queen and fashion plate with philosophical  inclinations.  This version doesn't capture at all the dull depression and cruel neglect experienced by Anne Elliot that the 95 film does so well.  And I'm sorry to say that the actress playing Anne seems rather more like a model than a great lady with a warm heart.  Still it's fun if you can't get enough Persuasion, but read the book and see the movie a bunch of times before attempting the miniseries.",3,"Interesting, but not exciting",1042502400,"01 14, 2003",2003,1683,"[""'ve"", 'seen', '1995', 'movie', 'starring', 'Hinds', 'Root', 'enough', 'times', 'read', 'book', 'want', 'see', 'execution', 'story', 'then', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'very', 'length', 'satisfying', 'four', 'hours', 'enough', 'time', 'little', 'more', 'shading', 'character', 'manner', 'see', 'Musgroves', 'Anne', 'arriving', 'inn', 'Lyme', 'example', 'character', 'Sir', 'Walter', 'little', 'less', 'obvious', 'hilarious', 'equally', 'narcissistic', 'What', 'remarkable', 'how', 'much', 'two', 'versions', 'are', 'really', 'are', 'very', 'accurate', 'adaptations', 'good', 'see', 'Italian', 'concert', 'scene', 'executed', 'different', 'actors', 'are', 'different', 'production', 'values', 'course', 'version', 'much', 'more', 'cheaply', 'done', 'perhaps', 'why', 'sailors', 'are', 'civvies', 'show', 'version', 'delve', 'connection', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'young', 'Mr.', 'Elliot', 'connection', 'was', 'entirely', 'ignored', 'film', 'least', 'more', 'sense', 'chasing', 'broke', 'cousins', 'money', ""'re"", 'afficionado', 'may', 'notice', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'entirely', 'charm', 'film', 'one', 'Lady', 'Russell', 'also', 'quite', 'different', 'sweet', 'old', 'lady', 'rather', 'society', 'queen', 'fashion', 'plate', 'philosophical', 'inclinations', 'version', ""n't"", 'capture', 'dull', 'depression', 'cruel', 'neglect', 'experienced', 'Anne', 'Elliot', '95', 'film', 'so', 'well', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'actress', 'playing', 'Anne', 'rather', 'more', 'model', 'great', 'lady', 'warm', 'heart', 'Still', 'fun', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'Persuasion', 'read', 'book', 'see', 'movie', 'bunch', 'times', 'attempting', 'miniseries']",Persuasion VHS

400283,AO80JEDFYS6MJ,6304087977,A. Reader,"[3, 6]","This is one of my favorite books, and for me the likable part of this adaptation is its length--more Jane Austen is always better than less.  However, the character of Anne is handled poorly.  First, the actress playing her was close to 40 at the time of filming--MANY MANY years older than she is supposed to be, and she looks it.  Second, in order to convey some of the written text, this adaptation has Anne saying things to Lady Russell that the character would never have said to her--she even comes close to arguing with her!  This from the character that Austen described as ""too good.""  Sir Walter Eliot is faithfully portrayed, but Elizabeth actually shows more sense than she is given in the book, but only at certain times, so she's difficult to even understand as a character.  Mary's selfishness and peevishness are even more pronounced than in the book, leading one to wonder why anyone would have ever married her--she was bad enough in the book.Since my copy came as part of the Jane Austen set--the rest of which is fabulous--I don't regret owning it, but I would be sorely disappointed if I had ordered this DVD by itself.  If you're considering this DVD, check it out from your library first.

400284,A3OF1GH939MZNJ,6304087977,Cyberlibrarian,"[8, 8]","I love Jane Austen's ""Persuasion."" It is not only my favorite Austen novel, it is possibly my favorite novel period.  I have seen all 3 of the available adaptations, and this is a distant second to the brilliant 1995 version with Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root.The poor production values aren't even a consideration; I can live with them if the rest of the adaptation rises above them.  But, in this case, the rest of the adaptation is bogged down by too much fidelity to the book.  For example, during the long walk, the book's Anne keeps herself occupied by reciting poetry.  In this adaptation, however, Anne stops in the middle of the lane and spouts poetry that refers to ""throbbing passions.""  Oh please.The scene where Wentworth helps Anne into the Crofts' gig is seen from afar, as if it didn't matter very much.  But in the book, it's a rather intimate scene that leaves Anne (and the reader) somewhat flustered.  We miss all that emotion.  And that, to me, is the crux of the matter.  ""Persuasion"" is a very emotional story.  Despite the poetry we hear during the long walk, this adaptation makes the story rather dry and, frankly, rather uninteresting.  I don't feel for Anne.  My heart doesn't break for her when she and Wentworth see each other for the first time in 8 years.I am glad that the constancy conversation is pretty much intact, but Anne and Harville are so loud that it's just not possible to believe that Wentworth had trouble hearing them (""You sink your voice, but I can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others."").  And then there's the letter.  Wentworth's letter is, in my not-so-humble opinion, arguably the most beautiful love letter in the English language.  But this adaptation changes the wording of this letter and, frankly, Austen's version is better.  I like the idea that the two of them talk after the letter, but the language is just too flowery and out of character that I don't really like the reality of the scene.As for the actors, Ann Firbank is almost 10 years too old for the part and we never see her bloom; Bryan Marshall doesn't look as if he's spent the past 8 years at sea; Charles Musgrove looks like a chipmunk; Benwick looks like a vampire (except for the orange skin; what's up with that?) and the Musgrove girls giggle so much that I can hardly listen to them.All in all, it's not bad, but it's not great either.  I don't hate it, but I don't love it, hence the ""it's OK"" 3-star rating.  Actually, I think it's more of a 2.5-star rating, but I can't give that so I'll err on the side of Austen and bump it up to 3 instead of down to 2.  Of course, it's still better than the 2007 version.  I don't even think those people read the book.  Or, if they did, they certainly didn't understand it.Anyone who's a fan of Austen should see this, but there's no need to see it multiple times.  It doesn't capture the heart or the imagination the way the 1995 version does.",3,Not my favorite.,1327104000,"01 21, 2012",2012,2948,"['love', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Persuasion', 'not', 'only', 'favorite', 'Austen', 'novel', 'possibly', 'favorite', 'novel', 'period', 'have', 'seen', '3', 'available', 'adaptations', 'distant', 'second', 'brilliant', '1995', 'version', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'Amanda', 'Root.The', 'poor', 'production', 'values', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'consideration', 'can', 'live', 'rest', 'adaptation', 'case', 'rest', 'adaptation', 'bogged', 'down', 'too', 'much', 'fidelity', 'book', 'example', 'long', 'walk', 'book', 'Anne', 'occupied', 'reciting', 'poetry', 'adaptation', 'however', 'Anne', 'middle', 'lane', 'spouts', 'poetry', 'refers', 'throbbing', 'passions', 'please.The', 'scene', 'where', 'Wentworth', 'Anne', 'Crofts', 'gig', 'seen', 'afar', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'very', 'much', 'book', 'rather', 'intimate', 'scene', 'Anne', 'reader', 'somewhat', 'flustered', 'miss', 'emotion', 'crux', 'matter', 'Persuasion', 'very', 'emotional', 'story', 'poetry', 'hear', 'long', 'walk', 'adaptation', 'story', 'rather', 'dry', 'frankly', 'rather', 'uninteresting', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Anne', 'heart', ""n't"", 'break', 'when', 'Wentworth', 'see', 'other', 'first', 'time', '8', 'years.I', 'am', 'glad', 'constancy', 'conversation', 'pretty', 'much', 'intact', 'Anne', 'Harville', 'are', 'so', 'loud', 'just', 'not', 'possible', 'believe', 'Wentworth', 'had', 'trouble', 'hearing', 'sink', 'voice', 'can', 'distinguish', 'tones', 'voice', 'when', 'would', 'be', 'lost', 'others.', 'then', 'letter', 'Wentworth', 'letter', 'not-so-humble', 'opinion', 'arguably', 'most', 'beautiful', 'love', 'letter', 'English', 'language', 'adaptation', 'wording', 'letter', 'frankly', 'Austen', 'version', 'better', 'like', 'idea', 'two', 'talk', 'letter', 'language', 'just', 'too', 'flowery', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'reality', 'scene.As', 'actors', 'Ann', 'Firbank', 'almost', '10', 'years', 'too', 'old', 'part', 'never', 'see', 'bloom', 'Bryan', 'Marshall', ""n't"", 'look', 'spent', 'past', '8', 'years', 'sea', 'Charles', 'Musgrove', 'chipmunk', 'Benwick', 'vampire', 'orange', 'skin', 'what', 'up', 'Musgrove', 'girls', 'giggle', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'hardly', 'listen', 'them.All', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'hence', 'OK', '3-star', 'rating', 'Actually', 'think', 'more', '2.5-star', 'rating', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'so', ""'ll"", 'err', 'side', 'Austen', 'bump', '3', 'instead', 'down', '2', 'course', 'still', 'better', '2007', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'people', 'read', 'book', 'did', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'it.Anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'Austen', 'should', 'see', 'need', 'see', 'multiple', 'times', ""n't"", 'capture', 'heart', 'imagination', 'way', '1995', 'version']",Persuasion VHS

Thurlow,"[4, 4]","This 1971 BBC version of Jane Austen's last novel,""Persuasion"", runs to nearly four hours on DVD, recreating virtually the entire story, along with all the subtle emotional turns, of a once-thwarted romance.  The settings and costumes are superbly authentic, while the digital remastering of the original television-quality film is generally seamless.Ann Fairbank plays Anne Elliot, daughter of the snobbish Baronet Elliot of Kellych Hall.  Family financial difficulties have caused the Elliot family to displace to Bath in search of cheaper lodgings, while renting the Hall to a Navy Admiral.  Circumstances throw Anne back into company with Navy Captain Wentworth, whose proposal of marriage she had rejected some eight years earlier, on the advice of close friend and mentor Lady Russell.  Wentworth is now wealthy with prize money from the Napoleonic wars, and looking for a wife.  His attentions appear to fall on Anne's younger cousins Louisa and Henrietta, much to Anne's hidden torment.  An incident at the seaside resort of Lyme will cause Wentworth to take a fresh look at Anne, just as the appearence of a rival suitor complicates Anne's life.This is a solid presentation of ""Persuasion"", although it helps to be familiar with the novel in order to follow the dialogue.  Fairbank is perhaps a little too attractive to play the supposedly faded Anne, while Bryan Marshall is not entirely convincing as a successful captain.  This reviewer wishes more effort had been put into the presentation of the dialogue between Anne and Lady Russell, in which Anne revisits the reasons for her original rejection.  However, the supporting cast is quite good, especially Anne's whiny younger sister and brother-in-law, and her knowing old friend Mrs. Smith.

400286,A1B86SJOKGAZ3B,6304087977,"E. Sadowski ""marine sis""","[1, 1]","I have noticed that the majority of people who have commented on this 1971 version of Jane Austen's , Persuasion, view this early BBC effort with a great deal of negativity. Therefore, I feel that I must at least address some of those issues. First off, many people seem to anticipate that this production would have a movie quality feel to it only to be hugely disappointed. Well, no, this has a feel of a stage play with performances by probably mostly theatre trained actors. As a result, their acting is different than in the movies. If one cannot separate theatre acting from movie acting then faults are bound to be found forcing some to unjustly say that none of the players can act. Also, I suspect that the majority who have commented are Americans like me. Nothing wrong with that except that the British people have traditionally appreciated the theatre more than their American counterparts. For that population, this version of Persuasion at the time was perhaps better appreciated.In addition, some say that because the whole book was filmed with some additional scenes added that wasn't there they felt the mini-series somewhat stilted, I say that it depends on your point of view. For some, like myself, I fully appreciate character development. Unlike the Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds version which I liked yet found lacking in many ways due to time constraint, this 1971 version fleshes out each character so one fully understands what he/she feels and is. However, in today's fast-paced world where people want information at the snap of the finger and run around so busy doing this or that I can see from where impatience with this Persuasion stems. Perhaps one needs to settle down, be open minded, and try to objectively watch without any expectation about whether this is going to be good or bad. Just because today's films are geared towards a fast-paced world doesn't always mean they are good. Many modern films lack character development and if a film is based on a book and one isn't familiar with it then initially it looks great but when one goes to the source material then the film pales due to lack of the richness that the pages hold. This leads to another common complaint. Yes, the production values of the mini series.Okay, so early BBC isn't up to par with today's BBC or production values. Due to a tight budget, this Persuasion as well as  many other early BBC classics were TAPED for the INDOOR scenes and FILMED for the OUTDOOR scenes. Yes, once again, the outdoor scenes are crappy looking but one should not judge based on what technology was available for a limited budget back over forty years ago. Just because we are used to the latest technological innovations used in Hollywood films (in particular) doesn't mean that a film is better. All the slickness with all it's glittery packaging will not make a modern mini series or film excellent if the storyline is poor, lacking, or confusing. If a person cannot view a beautiful piece of work because it is not up to par technologically speaking might just be an indication of someone's shallowness. To those of us who are capable we get caught up in the story and use our imagination instead of focusing on the low production values. The furnishings used wasn't bad either and I never really cared for them because the actors speaking were more important. Granted, the minor problem was with some of the costuming especially the green and black checkered dress Anne Elliot wore but I overcame that, too.Finally, to the issue of the actors cast for the roles. Everyone was appropriately cast. The fact that Ann Firbanks was older than the Anne Elliot of the book wasn't a big issue at all. The way I saw her was that due to her regret and disappointment  it shows on her face since she doesn't express her feelings as openly as other characters in the book but through her eyes and expressionsOne final word, when viewing classical works and in this case based on Jane Austen, one must remember what era it was written in--the 19th century. The way men and women behaved, talked, walked, spoke, thought, etc., is much different than in the 21st century. If one cannot attempt to understand how people behaved back then and try to infuse 21st thinking into a totally different era then disappointment will definitely be a part of the package. If one cannot accept the time this story takes place then perhaps one should never view classical works.",5,Beautiful Version!,1394668800,"03 13, 2014",2014,4442,"['have', 'noticed', 'majority', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'commented', '1971', 'version', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Persuasion', 'view', 'early', 'BBC', 'effort', 'great', 'deal', 'negativity', 'Therefore', 'feel', 'must', 'least', 'address', 'issues', 'First', 'many', 'people', 'seem', 'anticipate', 'production', 'would', 'have', 'movie', 'quality', 'feel', 'only', 'be', 'hugely', 'disappointed', 'Well', 'feel', 'stage', 'play', 'performances', 'probably', 'mostly', 'theatre', 'trained', 'actors', 'result', 'acting', 'different', 'movies', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'separate', 'theatre', 'acting', 'movie', 'acting', 'then', 'faults', 'are', 'bound', 'be', 'found', 'forcing', 'unjustly', 'say', 'none', 'players', 'can', 'act', 'Also', 'suspect', 'majority', 'who', 'have', 'commented', 'are', 'Americans', 'Nothing', 'wrong', 'British', 'people', 'have', 'traditionally', 'appreciated', 'theatre', 'more', 'American', 'counterparts', 'population', 'version', 'Persuasion', 'time', 'was', 'perhaps', 'better', 'appreciated.In', 'addition', 'say', 'whole', 'book', 'was', 'filmed', 'additional', 'scenes', 'added', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'felt', 'mini-series', 'somewhat', 'stilted', 'say', 'point', 'view', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'character', 'development', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'version', 'liked', 'yet', 'found', 'lacking', 'many', 'ways', 'due', 'time', 'constraint', '1971', 'version', 'fleshes', 'out', 'character', 'so', 'one', 'fully', 'what', 'he/she', 'feels', 'However', 'today', 'fast-paced', 'world', 'where', 'people', 'want', 'information', 'snap', 'finger', 'run', 'around', 'so', 'busy', 'doing', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'impatience', 'Persuasion', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'settle', 'down', 'be', 'open', 'minded', 'try', 'objectively', 'watch', 'expectation', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'bad', 'Just', 'today', 'films', 'are', 'geared', 'fast-paced', 'world', ""n't"", 'always', 'mean', 'are', 'good', 'Many', 'modern', 'films', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'one', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'then', 'initially', 'great', 'when', 'one', 'source', 'material', 'then', 'film', 'pales', 'due', 'lack', 'richness', 'pages', 'hold', 'common', 'complaint', 'Yes', 'production', 'values', 'mini', 'series.Okay', 'so', 'early', 'BBC', ""n't"", 'up', 'par', 'today', 'BBC', 'production', 'values', 'Due', 'tight', 'budget', 'Persuasion', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'other', 'early', 'classics', 'were', 'TAPED', 'INDOOR', 'scenes', 'FILMED', 'OUTDOOR', 'scenes', 'Yes', 'once', 'again', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'are', 'crappy', 'looking', 'one', 'should', 'not', 'judge', 'based', 'what', 'technology', 'was', 'available', 'limited', 'budget', 'back', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'Just', 'are', 'used', 'latest', 'technological', 'innovations', 'used', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'particular', ""n't"", 'mean', 'film', 'better', 'slickness', 'glittery', 'packaging', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'modern', 'mini', 'series', 'film', 'excellent', 'storyline', 'poor', 'lacking', 'confusing', 'person', 'can', 'not', 'view', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'work', 'not', 'up', 'par', 'technologically', 'speaking', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'indication', 'someone', 'shallowness', 'who', 'are', 'capable', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'story', 'use', 'imagination', 'instead', 'focusing', 'low', 'production', 'values', 'furnishings', 'used', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'never', 'really', 'cared', 'actors', 'speaking', 'were', 'more', 'important', 'Granted', 'minor', 'problem', 'was', 'costuming', 'especially', 'green', 'black', 'checkered', 'dress', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'wore', 'overcame', 'too.Finally', 'issue', 'actors', 'cast', 'roles', 'Everyone', 'was', 'appropriately', 'cast', 'fact', 'Ann', 'Firbanks', 'was', 'older', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'book', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'issue', 'way', 'saw', 'was', 'due', 'regret', 'disappointment', 'face', ""n't"", 'express', 'feelings', 'as', 'openly', 'other', 'characters', 'book', 'eyes', 'expressionsOne', 'final', 'word', 'when', 'viewing', 'classical', 'works', 'case', 'based', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'one', 'must', 'remember', 'what', 'era', 'was', 'written', '19th', 'century', 'way', 'men', 'women', 'behaved', 'talked', 'walked', 'spoke', 'thought', 'etc.', 'much', 'different', '21st', 'century', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'attempt', 'understand', 'how', 'people', 'behaved', 'back', 'then', 'try', 'infuse', '21st', 'thinking', 'totally', 'different', 'era', 'then', 'disappointment', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'part', 'package', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'accept', 'time', 'story', 'place', 'then', 'perhaps', 'one', 'should', 'never', 'view', 'classical', 'works']",Persuasion VHS

Other than Anne's ridiculous bee hive hairdo and green plaid dress, it didn't leave much of an impression. The second time I tried to pay closer attention and I did find a couple things to like. This time, my opinion remained pretty much unchanged, except I was able to notice some of the changes made from the novel. You'd think with such a long run-time, it would be extremely faithful. Is it? Well, yes and no. It does follow the novel pretty closely for the most part. Unfortunately, sometimes this can lead to really boring and dull scenes that are good on paper but don't translate that well to the screen. For example, the adaptation starts with Sir Walter reading aloud from The Baronetage as it introduces the characters he mentions. I found this a bit awkward. Who was he supposed to be reading to? Himself? And on the other hand, this version still managed to cut some things out- such as little Charles breaking his collar bone and the whole aftermath with Anne having to miss the party. I thought that was a somewhat important scene, so I was really confused when I noticed it was cut altogether.This adaptation did not leave much of an impression on me.

400295,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6304087977,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[8, 10]","I am also working through the Jane Austen Collection of DVD, which consists of BBC adaptations of all six of the writer's novels (one is a television movie and the rest are mini-series).  Since you can get the complete novels of Jane Austen in a single volume this seemed a nice companion set of DVDs, but as a general rule they are stately to the point of being sedate.  Not only do the covers of the six DVD cases look the same, so do the productions themselves.  This 1971 production of Jane Austen's ""Persuasion,"" with runs 225 minutes and is broken into two parts, was the second for the BBC following a mini-series in 1960.  Since then there has been a theatrical movie version, which is shorter but vastly superior to this one.""Persuasion"" is the story of Anne Elliot (Ann Fairbank), the most mature of Austen's heroines, who turned eight years earlier had turned down the marriage proposal of a young naval officer, Frederick Wentworth (Bryan Marshall).  Anne loved him, but was ""persuaded"" by her snobbish family that he was unworthy.  But the Elliot family has fallen on what for them constitutes hard times, with her father, Sir Walter Elliot (Basil Dignam), forced to retrench and lease their ancestral home, Kellynch Hall, and move the family to a smaller place in Bath.  So when the prosperous Captain Wentworth enters her life again the tables have been turned.  Anne is well away of the error that she makes, but it seems the captain's eye is now turned to the beautiful and impetuous Louisa Musgrove (Zhivila Roche).Running closer to four hours than three, this version of ""Persuasion"" does incorporate most of Austen's novel including her revised ending wherein for the first and only time one of the two people in love actually confesses their love to the other at the pivotal moment.  Granted, it is by letter, but compared to the standard ploy of people finding out inadvertently that someone loves them (e.g., ""Pride and Prejudice,"" ""Sense and Sensibility""), this is a breath of fresh romantic air.  Unfortunately, the only person who actually seems to have any genuine affection their loved one appears to be Charles Musgrove (Rowland Davies), who has the misfortune of being married to Anne Mary (Morag Hood).  But when Mr. Elliot (David Savile) actually seems more likeable than Captain Wentworth, that is not a good sign.  As for Anne, like many viewers it is hard to look at her and not think of Amanda Root's winsome performance in the 1995 film, but then everybody in this production is playing things too prim and proper.  The range of emotional responses is so limited with these performers that you have trouble distinguishing between the good people and the bad people.I have to admit that at this point watching these BBC versions does not inspire me to check out more of them but rather to put together my own Jane Austen Collection of DVDs that have the theatrical film versions.  Yes, they are always shorter and less faithful to the Austen novels, but there is more passion to their performances (see the current ""Pride and Prejudice"" for ample proof), and while it might not be strictly Austen by the letter, it definitely has more of a heartbeat.

No, just the opposite, in that it follows the book very closely.  It was the actors.  I got the feeling that the actors were all stage/theater actors.  There was little if any feeling, and emotion (when you're twenty or thirty feet away from the audience, facial expressions are not all that important I suppose).  it was as if the actors/characters were just going through the motions and saying their lines.  Anne did show some emotion and you could see it in her facial expressions, but it was slight and fleeting.  This version is completely passionless.  I understand that the newer versions (Amander Root, or Sally Hawkins) stray some from the book.  But since I am not an Austen purist, I can allow for a bit of straying, if it adds some feeling, emotion, and character.  If it gives the watcher a sense that these people are real, and believable, and this is not a ""stage-production"" but a real life experience, then I'm all for it.  Not to mention the Captain Wentworth in this version was just plain...well, plain.  Not handsome at all, totally unattractive.  I felt nothing as I watched him, and silently kept thinking ""can I actually sit through this entire movie??""  The Hawkins-Penry Jones version is my favorite.

Bruno""","[23, 29]","My family bought the entire BBC Jane Austen collection through Amazon.com for Christmas and decided to first watch the only video we had not previously seen - ""Persuasion.""  Let me first say that the ""Pride and Prejudice"" of this series is marvelous, ""Mansfield Park"" we love, and ""Northanger Abbey"" and ""Sense and Sensibility"" are good.  I will reserve comment on ""Emma"" until later.  However, this adaptation of Jane Austen's great novel ""Persuasion"" is just one step above completely hideous.  The only excuse we can give is that it was BBC's first attempt at a Jane Austen novel.There is so much wrong it is hard to know where to begin.  The script itself is coarse and insensitive, sometimes crudely spelling out the jokes or medical conditions for a presumedly ignorant modern audience.  The book by comparison is witty, elegant and subtle.  Most of the actors were atrocious.  It looked like amateur hour tryouts.  Some sets were anachronistic as were the costumes and characters, and the production was crudely directed and badly edited.First, the casting was generally horrid.  The exceptions were Sir Walter Elliot who was played with charm and wit, but the star, Ann Fairbank, is not much of an actress and certainly not as Anne Elliot.  She presents herself as a 40 year old ex-glamour queen with a forward personality and a grotesque hair piece.  She constantly gazes into the distance, completely spaced-out, but then the hair piece enlarged her head to the point she could have been mistaken for a space alien.  She is totally unconvincing as she ""reads her lines"" and has not the slightest spark of electricity with the sadly cast Captain Wentworth.  Charles Musgrove is much better as an actor, but although he is supposed to be Anne's age, he looks 25, more like son to mother.  Louisa Musgrove is a frivolous girl and a better actress than the star, but the famous accident at Lyme is a bomb.  Elizabeth Elliot is far too nice, and the ambitious, pretty Mrs. Clay is portrayed by an overweight, lazy and homely middle-aged woman who could hardly be thought to lure either Sir Walter or his sinister heir by her beauty and wiles.  Worst of all was Admiral Croft.  He could not act the part, and he wore a full beard unlike any Royal Navy officer of the Regency period.  He should have been on the Titanic and gone down with the ship.  He kept flubbing his lines, and the director must have been too lazy to reshoot the scenes.  We have honestly never seen acting this poor in community theater or even most high school productions.  Most sets were appropriate; however, the scene at Lyme showed pink front attached apartments with wrought iron trim that looked like they had been built in the 1920s or later.  The costumes were laughable.  (Did anyone do any research?)  Most of the costumes, you would think, were more more fitting for the 1840s through the  American Civil War, except for the fact that the fabrics, patterns and bright aniline dyes had the suspicious look of the late 1960s.  For example, Anne often wore a bright green plaid day dress with puff sleeves that gave the impression of a cheap costume rental used for ""Anne of Green Gables.""  If the director didn't shoot himself, he certainly should have considered it.The video did provide our family with hours of entertainment as we made fun of the production.  Now that we are in the mood, we can watch ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.""",1,Who told these people they could act?,1104624000,"01 2, 2005",2005,3423,"['family', 'bought', 'entire', 'BBC', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'collection', 'Amazon.com', 'Christmas', 'decided', 'first', 'watch', 'only', 'video', 'had', 'not', 'previously', 'seen', 'Persuasion', 'Let', 'first', 'say', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'series', 'marvelous', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'love', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'are', 'good', 'will', 'reserve', 'comment', 'Emma', 'later', 'However', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'great', 'novel', 'Persuasion', 'just', 'one', 'step', 'completely', 'hideous', 'only', 'excuse', 'can', 'give', 'was', 'BBC', 'first', 'attempt', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'so', 'much', 'hard', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'script', 'coarse', 'insensitive', 'sometimes', 'crudely', 'spelling', 'out', 'jokes', 'medical', 'conditions', 'presumedly', 'ignorant', 'modern', 'audience', 'book', 'comparison', 'witty', 'elegant', 'subtle', 'Most', 'actors', 'were', 'atrocious', 'looked', 'amateur', 'hour', 'tryouts', 'sets', 'were', 'anachronistic', 'were', 'costumes', 'characters', 'production', 'was', 'crudely', 'directed', 'badly', 'edited.First', 'casting', 'was', 'generally', 'horrid', 'exceptions', 'were', 'Sir', 'Walter', 'Elliot', 'who', 'was', 'played', 'charm', 'wit', 'star', 'Ann', 'Fairbank', 'not', 'much', 'actress', 'certainly', 'not', 'Anne', 'Elliot', '40', 'year', 'old', 'ex-glamour', 'queen', 'forward', 'personality', 'grotesque', 'hair', 'piece', 'constantly', 'distance', 'completely', 'spaced-out', 'then', 'hair', 'piece', 'enlarged', 'head', 'point', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'mistaken', 'space', 'alien', 'totally', 'unconvincing', 'lines', 'not', 'slightest', 'spark', 'electricity', 'sadly', 'cast', 'Captain', 'Wentworth', 'Charles', 'Musgrove', 'much', 'better', 'actor', 'supposed', 'be', 'Anne', 'age', '25', 'more', 'son', 'mother', 'Louisa', 'Musgrove', 'frivolous', 'girl', 'better', 'actress', 'star', 'famous', 'accident', 'Lyme', 'bomb', 'Elizabeth', 'Elliot', 'far', 'too', 'nice', 'ambitious', 'pretty', 'Mrs.', 'Clay', 'portrayed', 'overweight', 'lazy', 'homely', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'who', 'could', 'hardly', 'be', 'thought', 'lure', 'Sir', 'Walter', 'sinister', 'heir', 'beauty', 'wiles', 'Worst', 'was', 'Admiral', 'Croft', 'could', 'not', 'act', 'part', 'wore', 'full', 'beard', 'Royal', 'Navy', 'officer', 'Regency', 'period', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Titanic', 'gone', 'down', 'ship', 'kept', 'flubbing', 'lines', 'director', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'lazy', 'reshoot', 'scenes', 'have', 'honestly', 'never', 'seen', 'acting', 'poor', 'community', 'theater', 'even', 'most', 'high', 'school', 'productions', 'Most', 'sets', 'were', 'appropriate', 'however', 'scene', 'Lyme', 'showed', 'pink', 'front', 'attached', 'apartments', 'wrought', 'iron', 'trim', 'looked', 'had', 'been', 'built', '1920s', 'later', 'costumes', 'were', 'laughable', 'Did', 'anyone', 'do', 'research', 'Most', 'costumes', 'would', 'think', 'were', 'more', 'more', 'fitting', '1840s', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'fact', 'fabrics', 'patterns', 'bright', 'aniline', 'dyes', 'had', 'suspicious', 'look', 'late', '1960s', 'example', 'Anne', 'often', 'wore', 'bright', 'green', 'plaid', 'day', 'dress', 'puff', 'sleeves', 'gave', 'impression', 'cheap', 'costume', 'rental', 'used', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'certainly', 'should', 'have', 'considered', 'it.The', 'video', 'did', 'provide', 'family', 'hours', 'entertainment', 'made', 'fun', 'production', 'Now', 'are', 'mood', 'can', 'watch', 'Attack', 'Killer', 'Tomatoes']",Persuasion VHS

400305,A3XIJ6YQMIS4R,6304087977,"Read Sonja ""nonseqtr""","[28, 28]","I think that this version of Persuasion is very underrated. Reading the reviews for the '95 version you would think that no one had seen this one or any other before it. I can understand why this might be undervalued, the setting is very ""stagey"", it does not have the overall beauty and rich settings that newer versions can offer. The sound is very weak as well, the audio pick-up makes it difficult to hear all the lines. (British movies, especially older ones, are notorious for bad sound. I can't understand why new DVD releases do not automatically include subtitling, and I don't mean merely close-captioning, because they really need it.)  Further, there is the effect of the fabrics and styles which are so obviously from the 70's and can detract somewhat from the experience. Anne is wearing a plaid dress at one point! Finally, as has been pointed out the actress playing Anne is obviously quite a bit older then her 20 something role requires. However, all that being said, this is still one of my favorite productions so far. The reason? Despite all of these drawbacks I still feel that it captures the spirit of the novel better than any other I have watched. I love this Anne. She has a dignity and maturity combined with a sweetness of spirit that almost seems too good to be true at times, but is balanced by a subtle but wry sense of humor that prevents her from becoming inhuman and cloying. No other Anne that I have seen captures this to my satisfaction. In fact I found Amanda Root a very sad Anne indeed. She played her as a timid little mouse of a person beaten down by circumstance and victimized by her family. I couldn't respect her.To my mind one of the things that raises Persuasion above a mere Cinderella story is Ann's personality. Although her family does not value her she is someone who has such a capacity to love and such a desire to be loved in return that she rises above their pettiness and negligence and refuses to become bitter and hateful or pitiful and depressed in response to their lack of concern. Instead she tries to set an example and behave with the caring and consideration that she would like to receive. Her firmness of purpose and ability to value herself is clear in her every action and although she has her disappointments and doubts, she is certainly not a victim. Her ability to forgive and do what she feels is right despite so many obstacles is a clear contrast to Captain Wentworth's  pride driven anger which prevents him from understanding the reasons for her earlier rejection of his proposal.I wish that more people could appreciate this Anne. I think she is closer to Jane Austen's original character in many respects and that even the actress's age only helps emphasize the maturity of her character. The cover doesn't do her justice for although she is not especially beautiful she is a very handsome woman with a nice smile and I think that too is more like the original Anne who is never described (except by an obviously biased Captain Wentworth) as being especially pretty.Aside from Anne the other casting is all excellent. Her father and elder sister are the epitome of vanity and false pride. Her younger sister, the attention seeking Mary, is played superbly. Everyone else, from the solicitous but class-conscious Mrs. Russell, the bluff Charles Musgrove, the droll and somewhat eccentric Crofts, the obsequious Mrs. Clay and her lawyer father to the hospitable Hargraves, the dour Captain Benwick and the oily Cousin Elliot are very well cast. Louisa is very well done. Her lack of maturity contrasts Anne nicely showing both the self-centered forcefulness and the fearless sweetness of someone who has not yet experienced the disappointments of life and love. It is possible to envy her youthful vitality and pity her lack of awareness without disliking her personally which I think is a very difficult effect to achieve. In that regard I find that it rings very true to life.Captain Wentworth also has a boyish charm combined with a hint of that forceful and passionate personality which makes him a good leader on board ship and which made him so temperamental when faced with Anne's refusal. Both his hurt and anger and his later warmth and respect for Anne are played with equal spirit and verisimilitude. Even when he is angry you can see his kindness and strength of character. I don't think that Ciaran Hinds can match that given that he plays aloof and angry characters best. I found him too severe in the beginning and not quite believable when he later relents. It's just not his role. He did a better job as the bitter and more forceful Mr. Rochester in the A&E; version of Jane Eyre.Lastly, the scenery may seem a bit washed out, but that is due to both the location and climate in Britain and the style of filming at the time. Perhaps I am biased in this but I found the length of the film, rather than being off putting, instead allowed me more time to immerse myself in the world and to savor the nuances of the interactions that occur in each scene. I also found the scenery added to this effect and enjoyed the views of Lyme and the walks in the countryside very much for their realism rather than for the larger than life beauty found in more modern films. To my view many of the very things which might be considered negative in this film in contrast with newer ones were what attracted me to it. It doesn't have the polished quality of more recent offerings, but it does have a realism (despite the sound and 70's influence) that makes the experience more immediate. This is a favorite to watch when feeling ill or on a rainy day when something comfortable and non-demanding is required. It isn't especially steamy and passionate, but it is very intimate and warm-hearted.",4,Different Production Values but Excellent Characterization,1182816000,"06 26, 2007",2007,5774,"['think',

400310,A14IZYCM6C5G3S,6304087977,"Timothy B. Holt ""Go into the western sea""","[6, 7]","I guess that folks are just not used to doing things people did in 19th century England, like going off hunting, walking, gathering hazelnuts, listening to the skylarks, walking by the sea and looking at the fishermen, listing to a harp.  Boring, Boring, Boring...  Yes, back to your TV, back to your powerful car filled with useless electronics, back to your highways, back to your detective and hostpital romance dramas....This production is leasurely.  Anne is played by a very beautiful and noble looking actress.  If you cannot see a tragedy if such a woman had been persuaded (prevented) from marrying, when young, a handsome and enterprizing young man headed to sea with the British Navy, then you only see love in the very young ('She looks older it does not matter in your feelings somehow?').  The character does maintain a good spirit to assist all about her and does smile.  Should she grimace or cry like a good spoiled brat?  It is her character. She has not thought of her own happiness enough and has made life better for vain (father), selfish (sister1), self pitying (sister2) for years.  There are or were such people.The actors are all convincing to me.  I do not understand how the somewhat comical and dramatic character of the Musgroves would be seen as unrealistic.  The walks Annes sister's manipulation, her husbands patience, and good humor, the long country walks, the visit to the sea, all drew me in like a book would do.I believe that Captain Wentworth is very very well played. Something about the 1995 version with Ciaran Hinds made me feel the that there was no past or passion to reawaken there.  Somehow I did not believe.  I loved being able to see Admiral Croft (Richard Vernon) and wife interact with Ann and help bring about her and the captains meeting (I guess having worked years at sea with a lady lost in time, it does hit something in me).It is slower, but it is better.  OK. So if a walk to pick blackberries in the english countryside, or a walk on the pier in the west english coast do not appeal to you, and the idea of people bravely and with a smile doing their best for family and/or for country, even to the point of failing their hearts seems unlikely to you this version is not for you.",5,A good dramitization.

400312,A188NTJ5LV8LA4,6304087977,Wm19,"[9, 9]","My favourite Persuasion is still this 1971 old tv series.  Initially, the 1971 filming was a bit startling, but by the end of the series, I loved this Persuasion the most.  The production value reminds me of watching a play, as the tv technology was not so advanced 37 years ago.  So be warned, the visual and audio are not like what is available today.  However, this is still my favourite Anne Elliot.  She is dignified, composed, ladylike and kind.  It's a long tv series, so almost nothing is cut out from the book.  I loved this Anne, although the actress was a bit older.  She was exactly what she was in the book, sweetly dignified, kind to everyone, practical and it was easy to imagine her being very pretty in her bloom.  Unlike the other versions (below), Anne seemed not to be timid and spineless, but rather quiet and gentle as she is in the book.  Of the 3 Annes I've seen on tv/film, this was the only one I could see capturing the heart of Captain Wentworth.I first saw the 1995 Amanda Root Persuasion movie and was disappointed that Anne Elliot was such a timid, spineless, victimized, plain woman.  I found it very difficult to imagine that this Anne had been very pretty in her bloom, or became very pretty and sweetly confident by the end of the movie.I recently saw the 2007 Persuasion and was again disappointed that Anne Elliot was such an easily disraught, barely talkative character (although the scenery and Captain Wentworth were quite dreamy).  When they first speak of Captain Wentworth returning, her cheeks are supposed to become flushed.  Yet in the movie, Anne is gaping like a fish and completely discomposed.  And of course, there's the spectacle of her running and gasping around during the last part of the movie.So this 1971 version is my favourite.  Being an Austen fan, though, of course, I have all 3 versions in my DVD collection...",4,My favourite Anne Elliot,1208304000,"04 16, 2008",2008,1874,"['favourite', 'Persuasion', 'still', '1971', 'old', 'tv', 'series', 'Initially', '1971', 'filming', 'was', 'bit', 'startling', 'end', 'series', 'loved', 'Persuasion', 'most', 'production', 'value', 'watching', 'play', 'tv', 'technology', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'advanced', '37', 'years', 'ago', 'So', 'be', 'warned', 'visual', 'audio', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'available', 'today', 'However', 'still', 'favourite', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'dignified', 'composed', 'ladylike', 'kind', 'long', 'tv', 'series', 'almost', 'nothing', 'cut', 'out', 'book', 'loved', 'Anne', 'actress', 'was', 'bit', 'older', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'book', 'sweetly', 'dignified', 'kind', 'everyone', 'practical', 'was', 'easy', 'imagine', 'being', 'very', 'pretty', 'bloom', 'other', 'versions', 'Anne', 'seemed', 'not', 'be', 'timid', 'spineless', 'rather', 'quiet', 'gentle', 'book', '3', 'Annes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'tv/film', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'could', 'see', 'capturing', 'heart', 'Captain', 'Wentworth.I', 'first', 'saw', '1995', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'Persuasion', 'movie', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'was', 'such', 'timid', 'spineless', 'victimized', 'plain', 'woman', 'found', 'very', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'Anne', 'had', 'been', 'very', 'pretty', 'bloom', 'became', 'very', 'pretty', 'sweetly', 'confident', 'end', 'movie.I', 'recently', 'saw', '2007', 'Persuasion', 'was', 'again', 'disappointed', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'was', 'such', 'easily', 'disraught', 'barely', 'talkative', 'character', 'scenery', 'Captain', 'Wentworth', 'were', 'quite', 'dreamy', 'When', 'first', 'speak', 'Captain', 'Wentworth', 'returning', 'cheeks', 'are', 'supposed', 'become', 'flushed', 'movie', 'Anne', 'gaping', 'fish', 'completely', 'discomposed', 'course', 'spectacle', 'running', 'gasping', 'around', 'last', 'part', 'movie.So', '1971', 'version', 'favourite', 'Being', 'Austen', 'fan', 'course', 'have', '3', 'versions', 'DVD', 'collection']",Persuasion VHS
