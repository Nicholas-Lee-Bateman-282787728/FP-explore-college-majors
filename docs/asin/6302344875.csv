I first saw many movies on this program starring Bette Davis, James Dean, and Norma Shearer. &#34;Tall Story&#34; was one of these, and I'm glad I got to see it before the ancient times of &#34;Leave It to Beaver&#34;, and &#34;Ozzie and Harriet&#34; were over. I liked it, especially when Jane Fonda and Tony sang. The movie is based on a Broadway success, with good writing and solid performances. When I got this and watched it again, I felt bad that Anne Jackson didn't get to do more films. I enjoyed her much more than her husband, Eli Wallach, who did so many movies. Of course, Ray Walston is terrific. Tony is a little broad playing comedy, but nice. Jane Fonda oozes sex appeal. I would have preferred Tuesday Weld in the role, but she probably would have looked too young next to Tony.

308259,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6302344875,Dr. James Gardner,"[5, 7]","""Tall Story"" is a 1960 Josh Logan black and white film about college life, starring Anthony Perkins and Jane Fonda with Robert Redford in his big screen debut. It was based on a 1957 novel and a 1959 Broadway play.Anthony Perkins (1932-92) plays a college basketball star. Perkins is best remembered for his role as Norman Bates in ""Psycho"" (1960) and baseball legend Jimmy Piersall in ""Fear Strikes Out"" (1957). He was nominated for an Oscar for ""Friendly Persuasion"" (1957) and won Best Actor at Cannes for ""Goodbye Again"" (1961), but personally I think ""Fear Strikes Out"" is his best performance. Perkins plays a basketball player faced with ethical choices. He does a good job in this light comedy, although his basketball skills leave a little to be desired.Jane Fonda (1937 -) is better known for her social and political activism, but underneath there is a long and distinguished career as an actress, including Oscar winning performances in ""Klute"" (1972) and ""Coming Home"" (1978) as well as 5 more nominations, 2 BAFTA Oscars for ""Julia"" (1977) and ""The China Syndrome"" (1979), and an Emmy for ""The Dollmaker"" (1984). Four times she won the Golden Globe and the People's Choice awards as most favorite actress. ""Tall Story"" was her film debut. She plays a husband hunting cheerleader and she is very sweet.The marvelously funny Ray Walston (1914-2001) appears as Perkins' professor. Most people know him best as ""My Favorite Martian"" (1963-6) or as Mr. Hand from ""Fast Times at Ridgmont High"" (1982). Walston won 2 Emmys for his work on ""Picket Fences"" and a Tony for ""Damn Yankees"" (1956).Look for Robert Redford (1936 -) who  makes his film debut, uncredited, as a basketball player along with Gary Lockwood (""2001""). And look for Tom Laughlin (""Billy Jack"") as a married friend of the couple.Look for Joe E Ross (1914-82) in a small part as Mike, the restaurant owner. Ross is famous from his work on TV as the cook on ""The Phil Silvers Show"" (1955-9) and ""Car 54 Where Are You"" as Fred Gwynne's partner.Josh Logan (1908-88) directs. He was nominated 3 times for an Oscar (""Picnic"", ""Sayonara"", and ""Fanny"") but never won. He did, however, win 7 Tonys (stage versions of ""Mister Roberts and ""South Pacific""), a Golden Globe for ""Picnic"" (1955), a Pulitzer Prize (""Picnic""), and a WGA award for ""Mister Roberts"" (1955). Among the 11 films he directed are also listed ""Bus Stop"" (1956), ""South Pacific"" (1958), ""Camelot"" (1967), and ""Paint Your Wagon"" (1969). On a percentage basis, therefore, Logan was probably the most successful director ever. Logan's motto was - ""The individual actor, playwright, or director who breaks the spell by drawing attention to himself and crowing 'See how clever I am!' is a crook.""BTW - Logan was a good friend of Henry Fonda and expanded Jane's role from the limited one in the play to a major role in the film.In 1960, the top money earners were ""Swiss Family Robinson"", ""Psycho"", ""Spartacus"", ""Exodus"", and ""The Alamo"". The big Oscar winners were ""The Apartment"" (Picture, Director) and ""Elmer Gantry"" (Actor, Supporting Actress). Other notable releases that year were ""La Dolce Vita"", ""Inherit the Wind"", ""The Magnificent Seven"", ""Oceans 11"", ""Two Women"", and ""The Virgin Spring"".""Tall Story"" is not so much a basketball story (like ""Hoosiers"") but rather it is a story about college life in the 50s. The author of the novel on which the film is based worked at Hamilton, Bennington, and Brandeis so it is a slice of a very special type of college life. For other looks at college life, compare this film to the Marx Brothers' ""Horse Feathers"" (1932), John Houseman's ""The Paper Chase"" (1973), Rodney Dangerfield's ""Back to School"" (1986), ""Revenge of the Nerds"" (1984), and, of course, National Lampoon's ""Animal House"" (1978).The NY Times called it ""a tall ear of comedy corn"" and ""a old-fashioned campus frolic"". Time said ""Nothing could possibly save the picture"". Nor has the passage of time treated this film very well, and today it all seems a little nave and very much like the Rock Hudson Doris Day films of the same era - good clean fun and a happy ending. If you're a fan of those 50s romantic comedies, this is a good film for you.",3,Romantic comedy circa 1950s,1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,4191,"['Story', '1960', 'Josh', 'Logan', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'college', 'life', 'starring', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'big', 'screen', 'debut', 'was', 'based', '1957', 'novel', '1959', 'Broadway', 'play.Anthony', 'Perkins', '1932-92', 'college', 'basketball', 'star', 'Perkins', 'best', 'remembered', 'role', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'Psycho', '1960', 'baseball', 'legend', 'Jimmy', 'Piersall', 'Fear', 'Out', '1957', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Friendly', 'Persuasion', '1957', 'won', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Cannes', 'Goodbye', 'Again', '1961', 'personally', 'think', 'Fear', 'Out', 'best', 'performance', 'Perkins', 'basketball', 'player', 'faced', 'ethical', 'choices', 'good', 'job', 'light', 'comedy', 'basketball', 'skills', 'leave', 'little', 'be', 'desired.Jane', 'Fonda', '1937', 'better', 'known', 'social', 'political', 'activism', 'long', 'distinguished', 'career', 'actress', 'including', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performances', 'Klute', '1972', 'Coming', 'Home', '1978', 'as', 'well', '5', 'more', 'nominations', '2', 'BAFTA', 'Oscars', 'Julia', '1977', 'China', 'Syndrome', '1979', 'Emmy', 'Dollmaker', '1984', 'Four', 'times', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'People', 'Choice', 'awards', 'most', 'favorite', 'actress', 'Tall', 'Story', 'was', 'film', 'debut', 'husband', 'hunting', 'cheerleader', 'very', 'sweet.The', 'marvelously', 'funny', 'Ray', 'Walston', '1914-2001', 'Perkins', 'professor', 'Most', 'people', 'know', 'best', 'Favorite', 'Martian', '1963-6', 'Mr.', 'Hand', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgmont', 'High', '1982', 'Walston', 'won', '2', 'Emmys', 'work', 'Picket', 'Fences', 'Tony', 'Damn', 'Yankees', '1956', '.Look', 'Robert', 'Redford', '1936', 'who', 'film', 'debut', 'uncredited', 'basketball', 'player', 'Gary', 'Lockwood', '2001', 'look', 'Tom', 'Laughlin', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'married', 'friend', 'couple.Look', 'Joe', 'E', 'Ross', '1914-82', 'small', 'part', 'Mike', 'restaurant', 'owner', 'Ross', 'famous', 'work', 'TV', 'cook', 'Phil', 'Silvers', 'Show', '1955-9', 'Car', '54', 'Where', 'Are', 'Fred', 'Gwynne', 'partner.Josh', 'Logan', '1908-88', 'directs', 'was', 'nominated', '3', 'times', 'Oscar', 'Picnic', 'Sayonara', 'Fanny', 'never', 'won', 'did', 'however', 'win', '7', 'Tonys', 'stage', 'versions', 'Mister', 'Roberts', 'South', 'Pacific', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Picnic', '1955', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'Picnic', 'WGA', 'award', 'Mister', 'Roberts', '1955', '11', 'films', 'directed', 'are', 'also', 'listed', 'Bus', 'Stop', '1956', 'South', 'Pacific', '1958', 'Camelot', '1967', 'Paint', 'Wagon', '1969', 'percentage', 'basis', 'therefore', 'Logan', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'successful', 'director', 'ever', 'Logan', 'motto', 'was', 'individual', 'actor', 'playwright', 'director', 'who', 'spell', 'drawing', 'attention', 'crowing', ""'See"", 'how', 'clever', 'am', 'crook', 'BTW', 'Logan', 'was', 'good', 'friend', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'expanded', 'Jane', 'role', 'limited', 'one', 'play', 'major', 'role', 'film.In', '1960', 'top', 'money', 'earners', 'were', 'Swiss', 'Family', 'Robinson', 'Psycho', 'Spartacus', 'Exodus', 'Alamo', 'big', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'were', 'Apartment', 'Picture', 'Director', 'Elmer', 'Gantry', 'Actor', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Other', 'notable', 'releases', 'year', 'were', 'La', 'Dolce', 'Vita', 'Inherit', 'Wind', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', '11', 'Two', 'Women', 'Virgin', 'Spring', 'Tall', 'Story', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'basketball', 'story', 'Hoosiers', 'rather', 'story', 'college', 'life', '50s', 'author', 'novel', 'film', 'based', 'worked', 'Hamilton', 'Bennington', 'Brandeis', 'slice', 'very', 'special', 'type', 'college', 'life', 'other', 'looks', 'college', 'life', 'compare', 'film', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'Horse', 'Feathers', '1932', 'John', 'Houseman', 'Paper', 'Chase', '1973', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'Back', 'School', '1986', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', '1984', 'course', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Animal', 'House', '1978', '.The', 'NY', 'Times', 'called', 'tall', 'ear', 'comedy', 'corn', 'old-fashioned', 'campus', 'frolic', 'Time', 'said', 'Nothing', 'could', 'possibly', 'save', 'picture', 'passage', 'time', 'treated', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'today', 'little', 'nave', 'very', 'much', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'Doris', 'Day', 'films', 'same', 'era', 'good', 'clean', 'fun', 'happy', 'ending', ""'re"", 'fan', '50s', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'good', 'film']",Tall Story VHS

Since I'd never seen this film before in any format, I thought I'd give it a shot.  As it turns out, it wasn't as good as I thought it would be.Tall Story is a farcical look at college life circa 1960.  But, although it was filmed at Warner Brothers, it has the look and feel of certain early-50s 20th Century Fox comedies, such as Monkey Business.  The film lumbers along at an irregular pace, with scenes not transitioning well from one to the next.  Ray Walston, in the roll of a college professor, is given a large slice of the pie here and comports himself generally well.  Tony Perkins is well cast and believable in the male lead.  Jane Fonda is just plain miscast.  I've long considered Fonda to be a poor actress overall (exceptions:  Klute and the final two ""big"" scenes in They Shoot Horses, Don't They?), but here she's totally out of place.  She's too intelligent, too focused in her energy, too sophisticated, too mature (she was 21 or 22 here and she looks at least 25) and too elegant for the role of June Ryder.  This role requires a flighty, fun-loving, bubbly personality, and Jane Fonda isn't it.  Her abilities as a comedienne would improve later, when she adopted a dryer tone, but she doesn't pull the laughs in Tall Story that she should (I laughed at one of her lines).What's most interesting about this film is its parallel-universe flavor.  Tall Story was made/released in 1960.  In that same year, Warners also released Splendor in the Grass, another young love flick--quite torrid for its time and, consequently, more memorable.  Also in 1960, Tony Perkins appeared in Psycho, a huge hit then and a bona fide classic.  Murray Hamilton, who plays the basketball coach in Tall Story, appeared the following year in The Hustler, another classic.  And so on with some of the other participants.  It's almost as if Tall Story were being used to while away some time while the other, major works were gestating.Only watch this if you're a huge Jane Fonda fan.

I just watched it again on Amazon Instant Play as a very, very tall woman and it is still super adorable.  I thought I would see it as hokey now, but it was still really cute.  There were some parts that are more old fashioned than some would like.  But, the days of women only going to college to ""catch"" a man are over and everyone knows it. It is part of the comical charm of this movie.  To me, they were already poking fun at it in 1960.  But, I really loved that the boy and the girl both knew they needed to take their time as they got to know each other.  Something sorely missing in movies now of any genre.Two things I noticed that should be the same old fashioned way:  The Pom-Pom outfits should have stayed the same.  Classy and cute.  And the basketball outfits should have stayed the same.  Short and cute!  LOL.I also loved that they included a questionable lesson in Ethics.

308263,A37MH7ICH80QOX,6302344875,Kate McMurry,"[1, 1]","Ray Blent (Anthony Perkins) is a smart, successful student, a star of his university basketball team, and extremely popular. June Ryder (Jane Fonda) has arrived on campus as a freshman with a primary aim of finding a husband with good future prospects. She decides early on that Ray is just the guy for her, and she both amuses and scandalizes two professors whom she steamrolls into helping her with her dogged pursuit of Ray. In order to be near him, she becomes a cheerleader and signs up for all his classes, several of which these two professors teach. Because June does such a good job pretending everything Ray is interested in is fascinating to her, too, he concludes that she's not merely a pretty, empty-headed girl, but intelligent like him. Then Ray is conned by some crooked men into seemingly participating in throwing a basketball game, and his whole future is on the line.This 1960 black-and-white film is very much a reflection of the sexist, female steroeotypes of the era and some modern viewers may not be willing to tolerate those attitudes. For those who are willing to excuse those historical issues, this is an amusing little film.Anthony Perkins, who made his most famous film,Psycho, the same year this movie was released, plays Ray as an innocent, slightly goofy guy whose many blessings in life have not gone to his head. Ray is about 21 years old, and though Perkins was 28 at the time, he is believable as that age. He's not particularly convincing as a basketball player, however.Jane Fonda (Klute,Julia) makes her big-screen debut in this film. She was 23 at the time, which is not much older than the 18-year-old coed that she portrays. Hers is a rather standard ingenue part in romantic comedies of that era, a pretty young virgin who exercises ""womanly wiles"" in order to achieve her top priority in life, ""trapping"" a man into marriage. Given the limited scope of such a clich&eacute;d role, Jane does an excellent job fleshing out her character, making the conniving June sympathetic and humorous at the same time.Ray Walston (My Favorite MartianandDamn Yankees) is terrific as a straight-laced professor, and the hilarious comic actor Joe E Ross (Car 54 Where Are You) plays a local restaurant owner.I also enjoyed catching the brief appearances of some other well-known actors early in their careers, including Gary Lockwood (2001: A Space Odyssey), Robert Redford in his film debut as an uncredited basketball player on Ray's team, and Tom Laughlin (Billy Jack) as a married student whose wife is June's friend and co-conspirator to inspire Ray to marry June.The film is directed by Josh Logan, who is better known for more serious films such as Picnic, Mister Roberts, Bus Stop and Sayonara.If you enjoy romantic comedies of the 1950's and early 1960's, or you are a Jane Fonda or Tony Perkins fan, you might enjoy this film.",3,Cute but very dated romantic comedy,1371945600,"06 23, 2013",2013,2866,"['Ray', 'Blent', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'smart', 'successful', 'student', 'star', 'university', 'basketball', 'team', 'extremely', 'popular', 'June', 'Ryder', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'arrived', 'campus', 'freshman', 'primary', 'aim', 'finding', 'husband', 'good', 'future', 'prospects', 'early', 'Ray', 'just', 'guy', 'amuses', 'two', 'professors', 'whom', 'helping', 'dogged', 'pursuit', 'Ray', 'order', 'be', 'cheerleader', 'signs', 'up', 'classes', 'several', 'two', 'professors', 'teach', 'June', 'good', 'job', 'pretending', 'everything', 'Ray', 'interested', 'fascinating', 'too', 'not', 'merely', 'pretty', 'empty-headed', 'girl', 'intelligent', 'Then', 'Ray', 'conned', 'crooked', 'men', 'seemingly', 'participating', 'throwing', 'basketball', 'game', 'whole', 'future', 'line.This', '1960', 'black-and-white', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'reflection', 'sexist', 'female', 'steroeotypes', 'era', 'modern', 'viewers', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'willing', 'tolerate', 'attitudes', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'excuse', 'historical', 'issues', 'amusing', 'little', 'film.Anthony', 'Perkins', 'who', 'made', 'most', 'famous', 'film', 'Psycho', 'same', 'year', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'Ray', 'innocent', 'slightly', 'goofy', 'guy', 'many', 'blessings', 'life', 'have', 'not', 'gone', 'head', 'Ray', '21', 'years', 'old', 'Perkins', 'was', '28', 'time', 'believable', 'age', 'not', 'particularly', 'convincing', 'basketball', 'player', 'however.Jane', 'Fonda', 'Klute', 'Julia', 'big-screen', 'debut', 'film', 'was', '23', 'time', 'not', 'much', 'older', '18-year-old', 'coed', 'Hers', 'rather', 'standard', 'ingenue', 'part', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'era', 'pretty', 'young', 'virgin', 'who', 'womanly', 'wiles', 'order', 'achieve', 'top', 'priority', 'life', 'trapping', 'man', 'marriage', 'Given', 'limited', 'scope', 'such', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'role', 'Jane', 'excellent', 'job', 'fleshing', 'out', 'character', 'making', 'conniving', 'June', 'sympathetic', 'humorous', 'same', 'time.Ray', 'Walston', 'My', 'Favorite', 'MartianandDamn', 'Yankees', 'terrific', 'straight-laced', 'professor', 'hilarious', 'comic', 'actor', 'Joe', 'E', 'Ross', 'Car', '54', 'Where', 'Are', 'local', 'restaurant', 'owner.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'catching', 'brief', 'appearances', 'other', 'well-known', 'actors', 'early', 'careers', 'including', 'Gary', 'Lockwood', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'film', 'debut', 'uncredited', 'basketball', 'player', 'Ray', 'team', 'Tom', 'Laughlin', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'married', 'student', 'wife', 'June', 'friend', 'co-conspirator', 'inspire', 'Ray', 'marry', 'June.The', 'film', 'directed', 'Josh', 'Logan', 'who', 'better', 'known', 'more', 'serious', 'films', 'such', 'Picnic', 'Mister', 'Roberts', 'Bus', 'Stop', 'Sayonara.If', 'enjoy', 'romantic', 'comedies', '1950', 'early', '1960', 'are', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'Tony', 'Perkins', 'fan', 'might', 'enjoy', 'film']",Tall Story VHS

It has a very odd comic  tone(I've only felt this kind of odd sexual energy when watching something  like Pretty Maids All In A Row). Jane Fonda plays a young girl who's come  to college to get married-that's all. She is a huge basketball  fan-especially of the team's star player played by Anthony Perkins. On top  of two very funny performances by those tow-you've also got Ray Walston.  Ray is in rare form here and seems to show the beginnings of a Mr.  Hand-type teacher.

And she ends up in all of his classes.  This movie includes Ray Walston, as the professor.  This was a great movie which I think Anthony Perkins &amp; Jane Fonda had chemistry.
