In the end, it was a movie that deserves credit for at least being a little different from other stories.I'm not quite sure which kind of person this movie is supposed to be intended for.  In some instances it comes close to being a romantic movie with the woman and the butler eventually falling for each other after they get to know each other a little better.  But then again, the swear words are really extreme in other cases, and the movie's not suitable for everyone as a result.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[7, 7]","Watching two powerful and exceptionally talented actors play across from each other is something of a marvel, and that is certainly part of what makes BERNARD AND DORIS a great film.Based around the late history of tobacco heiress Doris Duke (here played beautifully by Susan Sarandon,In the Valley of Elah) and her close relationship with butler Bernard Lafferty (the phenomenal Ralph Fiennes,In Bruges), the film is a fictional take on the pair's relationship. Although no one knows what really happened between them, it is obvious that a friendship of unique qualities emerged. And Ralph Fiennes and Susan Sarandon are to be complimented on their astounding performances. Particularly Mr. Fiennes, who seems to turn every role he touches into gold (he did this, too, with his portrayal of The Duke of Devonshire inThe Duchess). That Ms. Duke left millions of dollars under the stewardship of Mr. Lafferty after her death is a documented fact, proving that she trusted him implicitly (Ms. Duke was a very savvy businesswoman).Some might think that sex had a part to play in it, but that would be a fools mistake because Mr. Lafferty was gay. And Ralph Fiennes plays the part of an early homosexual with perfect subtlety. His blossoming occurs under the keen eye of Doris, and the two give each other what they both need: companionship. It is a touching moment when Doris -- in a flustered state -- yells as Bernard and asks him, ""What do you want from me?!"" To which he simply replies, ""To take care of you."" And that is exactly what Doris needed in her waning years.As Doris grows older and more ill (a debilitating stroke hits her), Bernard is given the opportunity to truly care for her, and he does so with Doris' final wishes at the forefront (""No one sees Ms. Duke without my permission."") Much of this leads to confrontations with her legal council and those worried about Doris' accumulated wealth. Was Bernard doing as Ms. Duke wished? Or was he just biding his time until Doris died and then pounce on her funds?Regardless what you believe, Bernard was only given $5 million dollars and the rest he oversaw as a steward of many of Doris Duke's foundations. And upon his death (only a few years after Doris'), he donated all of his remaining money back to the Duke Foundation ...which should put to rest any worries about his motives.Strangely enough, after this film was shown at a film festival, it was switched from a theatrical release and went straight to cable television. But the bigwigs at the film companies were dead wrong to do that. The performances are stellar and the movie engaging. It has now garnered 10 Emmy nominations (that's a ton!), three Golden Globe nominations, and two Screen Actors Guild nods. Had this movie been released to the general public via theaters, I feel certain it would've garnered even more notice.

All the action takes place on Duke's NJ estate; nothing seen of her other houses in Hawaii and in Rhode Island and in Los Angeles. She moved around a lot and this disguises that. Then no mention of her disastrous adoption late in life of the young woman she later disinherited. At the end when Fiennes injects her with a drug that does her in, no explanation at all. For a full picture one needs to see the story told from a wider perspective, the one done by Lauren Bacall as Duke and Richard Chamberlain as Bernard. There one gets the idea that her MD in LA where she died sent instructions re her care to the bevy of nurses attending her and that he probably ordered a lethal dose of some painkiller to end her agony.

However, if character-driven dialogue stirs your blood, you need to see this HBO production.  Susan Sarandon and Ralph Fiennes let their considerable talents take over in this very poignant story about companionship and devotion.Based (loosely) on the life and times of heiress and philanthropist Doris Duke, Sarandon portrays her character as the ultimate cougar--and world's worst employer (the turnover with her personal staff was extraordinary).  Fresh out of rehab, the very fragile Bernard Lafferty (Fiennes) is given a tryout as Duke's personal butler; a special bond is established.  As the years go by Doris and Bernard develop a special affinity and chemistry together--based not on intimacy (Lafferty was gay), but on loyalty and devotion.  Duke is gruff, demanding, often petulant; Lafferty has a tendency to fall off the wagon, over and over; yet both of them continue to fulfill one another's needs for friendship and companionship.  The evolution of their relationship is fascinating to watch.Sarandon and Fiennes are both riveting; because they are in the bulk of all scenes together they play off one another so naturally the viewer forgets this is make-believe.  While I thoroughly enjoyed BERNARD AND DORIS the story does bog down here and there, then makes up for it by having Bernard go over the top when falling off the wagon, but all things considered these annoyances are trifling.

Yes, please.But oh no, this was so not the case. He was a super hot Irish butler with a drinking problem but he was also a Tranny! Excuse me but this played hardcore mess-maker with my little head. At first, I was just disturbed by the movie and talked to my friends about it a lot. I would just call them and text them and they were like, ""OK, will you stop now."" And then I couldn't stop thinking about Ralph Fiennes, my favorite actor ever, in full make up smiling into the camera and I was writing in my journal about it even. Finally, my man said, ""You know, you should talk to someone about this.""And I said, ""I am. I'm talking to you.""He said, ""No, I mean you need to see a professional therapist. You need the kind of help I just can't give.""So I did, I went into therapy for 6 months! I talked and talked about it. The therapist, Kim, she even saw the film on HBO one morning and was somewhat disturbed by it, as well. But she said what bothered her was the music, which she found to be overly dismal.In the end, now I know I can't choose the roles Ralph Fiennes takes but I can choose to watch the films and then pay thousands to go and talk to Kim about how hot Ralph Fiennes is.",1,6 Months of Psycho-Therapy,1229731200,"12 20, 2008",2008,1382,"['anxiously', 'awaiting', 'debut', 'movie', 'HBO', 'was', 'expecting', 'see', 'super', 'favorite', 'celebrity', 'number', 'one', 'crush', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'super', 'hot', 'Irish', 'butler', 'drinking', 'problem', 'Yes', 'please.But', 'oh', 'was', 'so', 'not', 'case', 'was', 'super', 'hot', 'Irish', 'butler', 'drinking', 'problem', 'was', 'also', 'Tranny', 'played', 'hardcore', 'mess-maker', 'little', 'head', 'first', 'was', 'just', 'disturbed', 'movie', 'talked', 'friends', 'lot', 'would', 'just', 'call', 'text', 'were', 'OK', 'will', 'stop', 'now', 'then', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'thinking', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'favorite', 'actor', 'ever', 'full', 'make', 'up', 'smiling', 'camera', 'was', 'writing', 'journal', 'even', 'Finally', 'man', 'said', 'know', 'should', 'talk', 'someone', 'said', 'am', ""'m"", 'talking', 'said', 'No', 'mean', 'need', 'see', 'professional', 'therapist', 'need', 'kind', 'help', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'So', 'did', 'went', 'therapy', '6', 'months', 'talked', 'talked', 'therapist', 'Kim', 'even', 'saw', 'film', 'HBO', 'one', 'morning', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disturbed', 'as', 'well', 'said', 'what', 'bothered', 'was', 'music', 'found', 'be', 'overly', 'end', 'now', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'choose', 'roles', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'can', 'choose', 'watch', 'films', 'then', 'pay', 'thousands', 'go', 'talk', 'Kim', 'how', 'hot', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes']",Bernard and Doris

As only Bob Balaban could put such a humorous and touchingly ironic film together (I suppose after working so closely with the Christopher Guest gang lo these past years!Christopher Guest Collection (A Mighty Wind / Best in Show / Waiting for Guffman)), BERNARD AND DORIS takes two people ,totally from different walks in life,but believe in a common destiny and purpose  and plan to this thing called life.Sarandon and Fiennes are CONSUMMATE pros in this duet of oddness, and both show phenomenal expression and depth to their characters.Once you meet ""their"" Doris and Bernard you will be hooked into performances that have been IMO absent from both of them of late;but THIS material is just too good for the likes of Sarandon and Fiennes to not rise to the absolute top of their game.They are magic,and the chemistry flows like the wine they guzzle,the pills they pop,the people that they step on and the orchids they repot (while smoking pot!).There is a comfortability with the roles and it shows.That this relationship became speculation in later years after Ms.Duke's ""uncertain"" demise is part of the fun of the guessing about what their understanding was in this dramady from HBO.In fact,any movie that opens with the words'""Some of these events are true...and some are probably not"" makes you chuckle and acknowledge that what you will see is going to be fun....and it is!
