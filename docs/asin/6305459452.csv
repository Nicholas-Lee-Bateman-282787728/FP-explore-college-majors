465446,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,6305459452,Andrew McCaffrey,"[1, 1]","The 1970s no-budget horror film seems to be a genre unto itself.  Other eras have attempted to counter their lack of funds by introducing certain elements that -- while cheap to produce -- give the film something to offer.  In the 70s, they just seemed to throw as much weird stuff as possible at the audience in hopes that some of it would stick.As an illustration, let me describe for you the film's pre-credits sequence.  At a secluded sanatorium for the mentally handicapped, the doctor in charge of the home is extolling the virtues of allowing one of his aggressive patients work out his negative emotions by shouting at him when he chops wood.  Moments later, while turning to explain his theories to a bystander, he promptly takes an axe to the back of the neck with predictably bloody results.A few moments later, a paranoid woman is guarding a child's doll, which she believes is her actual biological infant.  The violent outburst she suffers when she thinks her baby has been taken concludes with the strangulation of a nurse.I would find it difficult to spoil the plot, because until the last half hour the film really doesn't have much of one.  The story is told from the point of view of a Nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik, a fetching redhead who modeled for Playboy the previous year).  Charlotte arrives during the opening credits and finds herself working in a mental ward full of crazy people (not surprisingly).  She is introduced to the stereotypical group of movie mental patients, which include the army sergeant -- traumatized by the deaths of soldiers under his command -- who thinks he is still at war, a nymphomaniac, a middle-aged man convinced he's a judge on the court of appeals, an enormous black man who's had a lobotomy (the movie's gentle giant who loves popsicles and innocently blundering into the film's more disturbing sequences), and an elderly woman who warns of impending danger before apparently cutting out her own tongue.As I indicated, most of the film doesn't revolve around a straightforward story.  It's more a collection of individual strange scenes, most of which are seemingly unrelated to each other.  The movie seemed so disjointed that at times I wondered if this was a deliberate artistic decision.  I watched, theorizing if perhaps each scene was being told from the point-of-view of a different mental patient.  I came to no definite conclusions, but I state at times it can be difficult to tell whether a director is going for something artsy and meaningful, or if he has simply just lost his mind.I'm giving this film a slightly positive rating based solely on the fact that it didn't bore me.  It puzzled me, confused me and disgusted me, but I can't say I was bored.  Even the middle section which does drag on and on kept from being boring by becoming progressively more insane as time passed.On the other hand, trying to take this seriously is an uphill endeavor (made more arduous by the fact that the film seems to take itself extremely seriously).  Trying to find any logic to most of this stuff is next to impossible.  To be fair, there is an extremely neat plot twist near the end.  Part of my surprise was no doubt based on the fact that I hadn't even expected anything approaching cause-and-effect.  But even starting with extremely low expectations, you can see moments where someone obvious put some thought into this.The production itself looks very low-budget.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was filmed in one of the production crew's parents' house over a three-day weekend.  It's a very sparse set which gives the film a visually bleak flavor.  It's a disturbingly claustrophobic feeling; the exact opposite of those 1950s horror movies that took place inside massive, spacious mansions with foreboding shadows.  Here, you can immediately imagine trying to squeeze past one of the house's inmates in a narrow, too brightly-lit hallway while they make their way towards one of the bare, tiny rooms.  It's depressing to watch even before you take into account the murders, the madness and the mayhem.It's hard to tell if the picture and sound of Digiview Productions release are a decent reproduction.  The image is often overly whitewashed, but that may have been what the original production crew intended.However, there is some censoring present which will no doubt offend the purists.  While a Digiview disc of a different movie that I watched simply pixelled out the nudity leaving the scene more or less intact, here they seem to have taken out the scissors and clumsily removed any frame containing the nude form (and possibly any frames which happened to be nearby).  This renders one scene completely incomprehensible.  We go straight from the beginning of a sex scene, jump to some random images of people's faces and end in one of the participants leaping up and down on a bed, laughing hysterically and flinging laundry out of a door.  In any other movie this would appear odd; here, it seems about par for the course.Presumably, the producers felt they could play fast and loose with logic, based on the idea that a movie about crazy people doesn't have to make any sense.  It sort of works.  While I can't see myself ever wanting to watch it again, I did enjoy the mental explosions that went off in my head as I tried to make some kind of sense of the images presented before me.  This is not for the faint of stomach, or for anyone prone to headaches.  But if the cinematic equivalent of a mental breakdown combined with 1970s horror gore is something that sounds appealing to you, then you should give this one a look.",3,I can't look...,1166572800,"12

She has no idea that Dr. Stephens has just been butchered by one of the patients, nor does she know about the nurse who was killed. Charlotte meets Dr. Masters, who explains about the doctor's sad demise. Masters is reluctant to take her on board. That is until nurse Beale says she'll have to let the folks at her old hospital know about the tragic event. Charlotte is hired and introduced to the &quot;family&quot; of patients. There's &quot;The Judge&quot;, the same homicidal maniac who attacked Dr. Stephens. Then we have &quot;The Sarge&quot;, a vietnam vet with more than a little Post Traumatic Stress! Next up is Allison, the nymphomaniac of the group. Also, there's Harriet, who clings to a doll and protects it with fury and venom. Sam is the popsicle-addicted gentle giant with the heart and mind of a child. Danny is the obnoxious brat, always stirring up trouble with the others. A delusional old woman and a bipolar gal round out the folks on nurse Charlotte's new roster. Unfortunately for her, the patients know far more than she does about what's really going on in the house. What terrible secret is hidden in the basement? What is it that Sam keeps trying to tell Charlotte? S.F. Brownrigg has put together a pretty good tale of murder, madness, and mystery.

465450,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,6305459452,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[2, 2]","Disclaimer: The version of this film that I watched was included in Mill Creek'sDrive-In Movie Classics 50 Movie Pack.  As such, I cannot comment on the audio or visual quality of the disc on this product page - my review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.'Don't Look in the Basement', also known as 'The Forgotton', isn't a film that's likely to convert anyone into a fan of low-budget 70's horror if they aren't one already.  It isn't particularly shocking, or frightening; the special effects are equivalent to what you might see in a good haunted house around Halloween time; and it may be generous at best to call the acting mediocre.  Some fans of modern horror seem to especially hate these older films, and it's true that there is little with which to compare 'Basement' and the rather unrelenting and disturbing work of Tom Six, Eli Roth, or Rob Zombie.So if you are looking for a hidden gem from the seventies that will top contemporary films in twists, shocks, or just in general creepiness, you're probably not going to find it here.  (The originalTexas Chainsaw Massacremight be best for that.)  Still, given its limitations and viewing it with the context of when it was made in mind, 'Don't Look in the Basement' has enough going for it to make it a minor classic of its genre and of its era.A young psychiatric nurse arrives at a private institution housing a variety of mentally-challenged residents, only to discover that the head physician is dead and that another doctor, Dr. Masters, has assumed responsibility for the patients.  Over time, the new nurse becomes unsettled at both the patients unruly behavior and a series of strange events that seem to cut off completely the house and its residents from the outside world.  She begins to worry about her own sanity, and when she is forced to confront the secrets of the basement, the house erupts in madness and carnage.'Don't Look in the Basement' carries on the tradition of earlier gore films - somewhat reminding me of Herschel Gordon Lewis' work, such asTwo Thousand Maniacs- beforeFriday The 13thturned everything toward slasher flicks.  So instead of what I think of as the one-note storyline of Jason et al, there is more of a mystery involved here - making it more of a gory thriller than a fright film.  But aside from any technical merits the film may have (or lack), one of the reasons I like films of this type is their inherent unusualness - particularly compared to today's films.  This was a time of a lot of experimentation and pushing at boundaries.  Not all of it worked, but even the failures can sometimes be interesting just because of their _differentness_.  With its idiosyncratic (and certainly un-PC) representation of insanity, its reasonable and perhaps even surprising plot twists, and its grainy film stock that tends to creep me out visually, 'Don't Look in the Basement' is a must-see for connoisseurs of early 70's horror.  Probably of marginal interest (or none) to others.From Wikipedia, the run-time of this film is listed at 89-92 minutes, suggesting that other reviewers who claim the film is edited are probably right.  Mill Creek's 50 Drive-In Classic version is listed at 89 minutes, as is almost all of the other editions for sale here on Amazon, eventhis collector's edition.  There are a few that are listed longer, but I'm leery of them - they appear to be sellers offering DVD-R editions.  As for the version that I watched, it was no great shakes, but it was probably similar to most of these other offerings as far as audio and visual go.  Presented in 1.33:1, with no subtitles or extras, it was satisfactory to me considering the cost-averaged price, although if there were ever an unedited, cleaned up, anamorphically enhanced version, I would be interested in it (hint to whoever holds the rights to this thing).",4,Minor classic of early 70's horror,1320969600,"11 11, 2011",2011,3862,"['Disclaimer', 'version', 'film', 'watched', 'was', 'included', 'Mill', ""Creek'sDrive-In"", 'Movie', 'Classics', '50', 'Movie', 'Pack', 'such', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'audio', 'visual', 'quality', 'disc', 'product', 'page', 'review', 'concerned', 'entertainment', 'value', 'film', 'only', ""'Do"", ""n't"", 'Look', 'Basement', 'also', 'known', ""'The"", 'Forgotton', ""n't"", 'film', 'likely', 'convert', 'anyone', 'fan', 'low-budget', '70', 'horror', 'are', ""n't"", 'one', 'already', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'shocking', 'frightening', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'equivalent', 'what', 'might', 'see', 'good', 'haunted', 'house', 'Halloween', 'time', 'may', 'be', 'generous', 'best', 'call', 'acting', 'mediocre', 'fans', 'modern', 'horror', 'seem', 'especially', 'hate', 'older', 'films', 'true', 'little', 'compare', ""'Basement"", 'rather', 'unrelenting', 'disturbing', 'work', 'Tom', 'Six', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'Rob', 'Zombie.So', 'are', 'looking', 'hidden', 'gem', 'seventies', 'will', 'top', 'contemporary', 'films', 'twists', 'shocks', 'just', 'general', 'creepiness', ""'re"", 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'find', 'here', 'originalTexas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacremight', 'be', 'best', 'Still', 'given', 'limitations', 'viewing', 'context', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'mind', ""'Do"", ""n't"", 'Look', 'Basement', 'enough', 'going', 'make', 'minor', 'classic', 'genre', 'era.A', 'young', 'psychiatric', 'nurse', 'private', 'institution', 'housing', 'variety', 'mentally-challenged', 'residents', 'only', 'discover', 'head', 'physician', 'dead', 'doctor', 'Dr.', 'Masters', 'assumed', 'responsibility', 'patients', 'time', 'new', 'nurse', 'becomes', 'unsettled', 'patients', 'unruly', 'behavior', 'series', 'strange', 'events', 'seem', 'cut', 'off', 'completely', 'house', 'residents', 'outside', 'world', 'worry', 'own', 'sanity', 'when', 'forced', 'confront', 'secrets', 'basement', 'house', 'madness', 'carnage', ""'Do"", ""n't"", 'Look', 'Basement', 'tradition', 'earlier', 'gore', 'films', 'somewhat', 'reminding', 'Herschel', 'Gordon', 'Lewis', 'work', 'such', 'asTwo', 'Thousand', 'Maniacs-', 'beforeFriday', '13thturned', 'everything', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'So', 'instead', 'what', 'think', 'one-note', 'storyline', 'Jason', 'et', 'al', 'more', 'mystery', 'involved', 'here', 'making', 'more', 'gory', 'thriller', 'fright', 'film', 'aside', 'technical', 'merits', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'lack', 'one', 'reasons', 'like', 'films', 'type', 'inherent', 'unusualness', 'particularly', 'compared', 'today', 'films', 'was', 'time', 'lot', 'experimentation', 'pushing', 'boundaries', 'Not', 'worked', 'even', 'failures', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'interesting', 'just', '_differentness_', 'idiosyncratic', 'certainly', 'un-PC', 'representation', 'insanity', 'reasonable', 'perhaps', 'even', 'surprising', 'plot', 'twists', 'grainy', 'film', 'stock', 'creep', 'out', 'visually', ""'Do"", ""n't"", 'Look', 'Basement', 'must-see', 'connoisseurs', 'early', '70', 'horror', 'Probably', 'marginal', 'interest', 'none', 'others.From', 'Wikipedia', 'run-time', 'film', 'listed', '89-92', 'minutes', 'suggesting', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'claim', 'film', 'edited', 'are', 'probably', 'right', 'Mill', 'Creek', '50', 'Drive-In', 'Classic', 'version', 'listed', '89', 'minutes', 'almost', 'other', 'editions', 'sale', 'here', 'Amazon', 'collector', 'edition', 'are', 'few', 'are', 'listed', 'longer', ""'m"", 'leery', 'appear', 'be', 'sellers', 'offering', 'DVD-R', 'editions', 'version', 'watched', 'was', 'great', 'shakes', 'was', 'probably', 'similar', 'most', 'other', 'offerings', 'as', 'far', 'audio', 'visual', 'go', 'Presented', '1.33:1', 'subtitles', 'extras', 'was', 'satisfactory', 'considering', 'cost-averaged', 'price', 'were', 'ever', 'unedited', 'cleaned', 'up', 'anamorphically', 'enhanced', 'version', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'hint', 'whoever', 'rights', 'thing']",Don't Look in the Basement

The first time I watched ""Don't Look in the Basement"", I was about 9 or 10.  I didn't really know what I was watching.  All I remember was thinking ""These people are weird!"" and ""What am I watching, anyway?!""  When I saw it again, for the first time in nearly 10 years, I started to understand it, but, I hadn't remembered much of it, and I was surprised at a few of the things I had seen.  The only thing I had really remembered was the old woman with her crazy poems and telling Nurse Charlotte to ""Get out, and never, ever come back!""After watching this movie a few more times, I can honestly say that it's not really a scary movie, by any means.

(1973), aka The Forgotten, one would expect the area mentioned to play a pivotal part in the story, but I can say, after having watched the movie last night, it really doesn't, not to the degree I would have thought, and that was a little disappointing as I was in the mood for some good, old fashion miscreant cellar dwelling shenanigans. Oh well...produced and directed by S.F. Brownrigg (Scum of the Earth, Don't Open the Door!), who got his start doing sound work for Larry Buchanan's Azalea Productions group, working on made for TV features like Attack of the Eye Creatures (1965) and Zontar the Thing from Venus (1966) before venturing out into the world of independent features, the film features Bill McGhee (Curse of the Swamp Creature), Annabelle Weenick (Don't Open the Door!, Keep My Grave Open), credited as Anne MacAdams, and former playmate Rosie Holotik (Twisted Brain). Also appearing is Gene Ross (Encounter with the Unknown, Scum of the Earth), Camilla Carr (Logan's Run), and Hugh Feagin (In the Year 2889), among others...The film opens at a large, white, isolated house in the country, one that serves as a sanitarium run by a man named Dr. Stephens, who has a unique method for dealing with his patients in that he encourages their wacky behavior in the hopes that once the patients go completely around the bend, their normalized cores will emerge and assume control over their nutty behavior, or some BS like that...and BS it is, as Dr. Stephens quickly learns after one of his patients plants a hatchet in one of the doctor's vital areas...oops...following Stephens demise, his assistant, Dr. Geraldine S. Masters (Weenick), assumes control of the asylum, and along comes a pretty, young doctor named Charlotte Beale (Holotik), whom made arrangements to come and work for Stephens prior to his `accident'. Charlotte isn't too well received by Dr. Masters (she's got big plans for the place, apparently), but she allows Charlotte to stay given the recent shortage of qualified employees at the nut house (the only, other nurse sought to terminate her employment, but found herself terminated instead). After Masters breaks the news to Charlotte with regards to the late Dr. Stephens and accepts her on a trial basis, the pair begin to settle in and we get to meet a number of the resident nut jobs, including Sam (McGhee), a large African American man with the mentality of an eight year old, who loves toy sailboats and Popsicles (seems his diminished mental capacity was the result of a prior lobotomy). Anyway, the `accidents' persist, especially towards those residents who try, in their own, peculiar ways, to warn Charlotte to leave (Charlotte's not only pretty, but pretty dense), eventually leading up to some unsurprising revelations, a whole lot of overacting, a few more hideous deaths, and the (hold your breath) reason as to why we weren't supposed look in the basement, which, had we done so early on, it would have cleared a whole lot of things up, at least for Charlotte, and probably saved her a whole lot of grief, but would have resulted in a much shorter movie.Don't Look in the Basement! was indicative of much of the independently released fare being peddled to non-discriminating drive-in movie patrons throughout the late 1960s/early 1970s in that it had extraordinarily low production values, featured generally lousy acting, and was sleazy as all get out. Making no apologies on the filmmaker's behalf for any of the shortcomings of this feature, I would offer that to truly appreciate a feature like this, its best witnessed it in its intended element, that being a dusty, well worn, litter-strewn drive-in, shown with numerous other features of the same vein (the vein I speak of here being shoddy). Put in that context, believe it or not, this film is actually fairly decent. One of the main faults I had with this film was the fact it offered no surprises, as the `big' secret was pretty obvious from the get go, and I think I'm about as intuitive as the next person, so I find it hard to believe others couldn't have figured it out as easily or quickly as I did...given I didn't have a big revelation scene to look forward to anymore, I was hoping for some kooky fun in the scenes leading up to said reveal, and there was, but more often than not the various sequences featuring the oddball residents acting all nutty felt like filler material thrown in to flesh out the running time, and not something really connected to the plot. Throughout the movie we did see continual fallout as some prankster kept pushing the inmates buttons, driving them to react, usually in a hostile manner, towards those obviously chosen as targets. In one sequence we see a mysterious individual steal a patient's doll (the patient thinks it's real), and then leave it in another's room for the nut job to find...and when she does, she takes her angry freak out on the person whose room she found her doll in, even though they had nothing to do with the theft. As far as Charlotte, besides being thick as friggin' brick (I would have viewed my employment contract null and void once the bodies started piling up), she was pretty, and not much else. Who quits a job as head of a department to take a nursing position in some podunk, obviously understaffed sanitarium way out in the boonies? There's really not much going on there, as the woman spends most her time bouncing around, reacting, i.e. screaming and crying, to various situations, never really trying to take any sort of control to extricate herself from harm's way. I liked Allyson, the patient with man issues (she craved love), and her tendency to disrobe at the drop of a hat (Ms. Holotik's clothes stay on throughout), but I really hated Danny, the skinny idiot man child who looked like the illegitimate result of a mating between Art Garfunkel and Larry Fine, only because his stupid, braying laugh was so irritating. Perhaps my favorite character was that of the character of the telephone repairman, as you could tell he wasn't a real actor (he was also the gaffer on the film), and was just having fun with his part. This was Brownrigg's directorial debut and I thought he did pretty well, putting forth a good effort on a low rent production.The fullscreen (1.33:1) picture on this VCI Home Video release looks decent, although a little washed out at times, and the Dolby Digital audio comes through good enough. As far as extras, there's something called `Film Factiods', which is really just an uneven listing of cast and crew filmographies/biographies, along with some previews including Blood and Black Lace (1964), The Bird with the Crystal Plumage (1970), The Night Visitor (1971), and Gorgo (1961). There appear to be any number of DVD releases of this film out there, indicating perhaps the original copyright of the feature has lapsed and the film is now in the public domain, so potential buyers should be wary of the version they pick up, as I'm sure some look better than others.Cookieman108If I learned anything from this film it's that you should never take a job in an asylum that doesn't

465456,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6305459452,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[7, 9]","I must say that Don't Look in the Basement really impressed me.  Here's a film with little production value, no budget to speak of, and a Playboy cover model (April 1972) in the lead role - and yet the movie does so much with so little that I have to honor it with five stars.  Largely due to its one-time pairing with Last House on the Left at many a drive-in theatre, the film has developed something of a cult status since its release.  I say it deserves a strong cult status judged solely on its own merits.  Some may call it sleaze or exploitation drivel (and the UK once included it among its banned ""nasties"" for no reason I can possibly fathom, as it isn't that gory), but I call it a disarming, underground work of genius.  I can't find any of the humor that some seem to glean from the film - to me, it's dark and disturbing and quite memorable.All of the action takes place at the Stephens Sanitarium, with the story providing us a good handle on each of the unfortunate patients residing there.  Dr. Stephens himself is something of a rebel, as he gives his patients a lot of free rein; his form of treatment basically involves taking each patient all the way through his/her obsessions and out the other side.  Unfortunately, Dr. Stephens learns first-hand that he really doesn't have all of the kinks worked out of his treatment method - letting a mental patient work out his aggression with an axe turns out to be a mistake.  That evening, young Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives at the sanitarium, where she is informed by Dr. Masters (Annabelle Weenick) that the man who just hired her is now dead.  Dr. Masters is none to anxious to take on a new nurse at this particularly difficult time, but she eventually relents and welcomes Charlotte to the ""family.""  Some viewers feel that the movie drags as we spend a good deal of time getting to know each of the patients, but I actually found this to be the most fascinating and impressive part of the film.  Bill McGhee is just superb in the role of Sam, a childlike man who claims that Dr. Stephens still talks to him, but all of the other actors are also quite good in their respective roles.  You have, among others, a serious fellow who was (or at least thinks he was) a judge, an extremely needy woman driven mad by a string of rejections, a guy who still thinks he's fighting a war (one in which he somehow got the rest of his men killed in real life), a demented Partridge Family wannabe who likes to scare and basically just bug the heck out of everybody, a woman who believes that her baby doll is a real baby, and a mad old woman who warns Charlotte to leave that place.  After Nurse Beale's arrival, bad things start happening, the details of which I won't go into, and eventually the whole asylum pretty much falls apart as the film's memorable ending approaches.There is one aspect to the whole story that you may or may not pick up on early on.  The good news it that it really doesn't matter either way.  This film is in no way a one-trick pony, and in fact the final climactic scenes trump this matter entirely because it is dealt with explicitly by the time you get there.Don't Look in the Basement is all about good acting, a good story, and unconventionally effective directing.  S.F. Brownrigg used low camera angles and other unusual directing techniques to present the story, and I think he worked wonders.  I would caution my fellow horror lovers not to go in expecting a veritable gorefest, however, as you just won't find it here.  There is a gory aspect to the film, especially in its final scenes, but it is by no means excessive.  It's really the atmosphere that Brownrigg brings to life that fuels this story.  It can really be downright depressing at times, but it is the unbridled emotion of the film rather than the comparatively sparse blood and gore that will stay with you after all is said and done.

There is nothing here for anyone but the truly nostalgic trying to recapture their youth.I think the best use for this film would be for schools to use it to demonstrate errors in filmmaking and how to avoid them.

Such is the case with ""Don't Look in the Basement"".  In fact, all of these ""Don't look"" movies seem to be very similar in this respect...they just do not have what it takes to be a good horror movie or even a decent horror movie for that matter.  I was bored stiff while watching this trash because the movie has no spirit, no style and no substance either.  ""Don't Look in the Basement"" is plagued by poor direction and atrocious acting.Basically, ""Don't Look in the Basement"" is about an insane assylum where the doctors subscribe to rather radical methods of treatment.  Truly, one wonders if the doctor is as crazy as the mental patients.  Dr. Stevens' idea is that the only way to cure these mentally disturbed people is to allow them to act out their obsessions.  However, the plot and storyline are very poorly developed, the movie's action fails to hold the viewer's interest and also struggles to some extent to provide the viewer with a clear understanding of what is actually going on in this movie.  The only interesting aspect deals with Dr. Masters' role in this movie, and that is the only reason the movie is able to produce any kind of tension in the audience.  However, this tension is clearly tempered or blunted by the movie's fatal flaws of awful acting, poor direction, poorly developed plot, low-budget production values, and a lackluster screenplay.

465459,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,6305459452,Jeffrey Leach,"[4, 5]","""Don't Look in the Basement"" is a prime example of the sort of god awful dreck that once played regularly at the country's drive in movie establishments. Those were the days, weren't they? Actually, I don't have many first hand memories of those days because I was far too young to see these dreadful gorefests. I was far too young to drive a car, as a matter of fact. I did get a chance to go to the drive in occasionally, but only to see double bills of big budget movies weeks after their opening date. The last drive in around here closed several years ago, long after the powers that be quit making movies like this one solely for the drive in crowd. Thanks to DVD we now get to watch these gems (cough, cough) in the comfort of our homes, but I suspect something very precious fails to make the transition from one medium to another. Part of the allure of these films comes from sitting in a car watching them. While there are plenty of bad, low budget films floating around in video stores, none of the filmmakers hope to receive a theatrical screening let alone a place on the play list at the drive in.""Don't Look in the Basement"" is a sleazy piece of junk that tells the story of a lunatic asylum, its various inmates, and the fate of a young nurse who just happens to accept a job there. Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) takes a position with Dr. Stephens (Michael Harvey) because his radical treatment therapies seem intriguing. What are these therapies? Nothing more than allowing patients to engage in the behavior brought on by their myriad mental problems. For instance, one inmate likes to swing an axe around whenever he gets the chance. Fine, says good old Dr. Stephens, let the man swing a sharp instrument in the backyard every chance he gets. Sadly, when Stephens's attention strays for a second the axe crashes into his chest and drops him like a stone. Perhaps his ideas needed more study first. Anyway, Charlotte turns up at the asylum shortly after this tragedy, with a letter from Stephens clutched in her pretty little fist, and presents herself to the doctor's personal assistant Dr. Masters (Anne MacAdams). For some inexplicable reason, Masters expresses an extreme dislike for the young Charlotte. She tries everything she can think of to get this young lady out of the asylum, but our heroine isn't to about to leave. Good for her!Well, bad for her. She should have left since this asylum houses all sorts of frightening loonies just itching to cause a heap of trouble. Lobotomy patient Sam (William McGhee) spends most of his time shuffling around the grounds sucking on Popsicles and giggling. Danny (Jessie Kirby) is a red headed waif whose presence simply screams danger. No mental motel would be complete without the military guy gone over the top, and in that position we have Sergeant Jaffe (Hugh Feagin). I shouldn't forget to mention Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross), the guy who swung the fateful axe and the one who always blurts out a memorized bit of dialogue that highlights his position as one of the country's preeminent jurists. Too, Allyson King (Betty Chandler) turns up from time to time as the resident suffering from the obligatory problems centering on men. The film devotes a significant amount of screen time to developing these diverse characters, almost too much since nothing much happens until a few murders throw everyone in the building into a tizzy. Who is killing people in the asylum and why? Trying to pin down a suspect in this group is about as easy as trying to open a childproof cap while wearing a pair of mittens.It's sufficient to say that the whole movie exists for the sake of a plot twist at the end that any viewer with an ounce of intelligence saw coming for over an hour. Sadly, I can't divulge the exact specifics of this plot twist (I don't want to ruin the movie for those intent on seeing it and all), but it's safe to say that the horrific denouement revolves around a character who isn't what he or she appears to be. Big surprise, that. In the meantime most of the inmates have a splendid time tormenting poor Charlotte to the point that she's ready to check in for some treatment herself. The real charm of the movie doesn't come from the hackneyed plot or the poor gore effects, but from the surprisingly effective performances of the low rent cast. Every character is nothing less than totally believable as people with serious mental disorders. Not that I have spent much time examining the mentally unstable, mind you, but it does appear that these people have a lot of problems. Of course, the biggest problem might be appearing in a movie like this one. Nonetheless, it is fun to watch ""Don't Look in the Basement"" for the histrionic factor. What happens to that poor repairman is worth the price of admission alone.Expect a small number of extras on the disc. A few film factoids and trailers for ""The Night Visitor,"" ""The Bird with the Crystal Plumage,"" and Bava's ""Blood and Black Lace"" forms the sum total of supplements. The picture and audio quality are the pits. I imagine the age of the film and the poor quality of the film stock account for most of the transfer problems, but the technicians could have done a better job. Worse, I've heard ominous rumblings that this is a cut version of the film. I don't understand why a company puts out a DVD without providing a full print, but such is life. Hopefully a better edition from one of the bigger horror DVD companies will soon arrive. Until then, ""Don't Look in the Basement"" still provides a few chuckles.",3,Drive in dreck,1107734400,"02 7, 2005",2005,5557,"['Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Basement', 'prime', 'example', 'sort', 'god',

465461,A39AZT0WDM8AC9,6305459452,KEVIN BRIAN,"[1, 1]","watched this little bargain basement horror parade many years ago while cleaning the house one very sunny afternoon. which is something I very seldom ever do. and haven't since then. that is, enjoy the bright sun while cleaning house, and especially, while watching a horror movie.however, I recently gave it another shot late one night last week, and I must say, after a short time in, despite the gritty low-budget, and overacting to say the least, the madness becomes quite the charm.if you like OLD-SCHOOL STYLE SLASHER FILMS, or, those grungy GRIND HOUSE/DRIVE-IN movies that, despite popular opinion, have their importance in cinema history, this basement is for you. especially if you are a fan of FRIDAY the 13th: a NEW BEGINNING. I kid you not. the movie follows that story (a bunch of quirky, colorful characters, in a half way house for the slightly insane, are knocked off, one by one, by a mysterious killer) Hell, there's even a token nice black guy, and an actress that jumps into her role with such bold zest that would give BETSY PALMER, Jason's mommy, a run for her money. this woman is a hoot! and really holds it all together. with an ending that is just as climatic as the original FRIDAY THE 13TH. with relish.yes! there are many flaws. just as many broken plot points as the characters within. for instance, it's only a small, two story home, but yet the crazy hysterics, and gory violent murders, seem to each take place in their own universe, making it hard to map out, exactly, where, when, and how, it's all happening within in the asylum.

465467,A157XTSMJH9XA4,6305459452,One of many,"[13, 15]","(First of all, in case you're wondering, the transfer of this particular DVD addition is fine. There are no special features, but the cheap price does not mean cheap quality.)Upon reading positive reviews, I expected Don't Look In The Basment to be a gory shocker that made it all worth while with a fantastic ending. Well, the gore was not over-the-top -- it was quite mild compared to the many horror films I've seen. And the ending -- although satisfying -- was not a huge surprise or twist. I enjoyed this film for a different reason. Here is my opinion of 1973's Don't Look In The Basement...The film opens with a first look at the inmates of the small asylum (it appears to be more of a home for the mentally ill than an actual hopsital or ""asylum"", but you get the idea). Sgt. Jaffe -- a military verteran who still believes he is battling the enemy one day at a time -- is sharing his observations of the trees outside his bedroom window with Sam -- a man who has the mentality of an eight-year-old from the result of a lobotomy (lobotomies usually leave the patient much more ""mindless"" and withdrawn from their surroundings, but hell, let's humor the writers). These are just two of the patients you will meet throughout the movie. The others are Allyson, a woman who is desparate for love although she fails to understand how recurring sexual advances will not find her the man of her dreams; Danny, a red-headed man who is the epitome of an annoying, maniacally giggling child; Oliver, who still believes he holds his position in the courts as a judge; Jennifer, a withdrawn and quiet girl who doesn't seem to have a very strong sense of connection with the external world; Mrs. Callingham, an elderly woman who becomes quite creepy with her obsession with nonexistant places and people; and Harriet, a woman who insists her baby doll is her real child. Among other important characters are Dr. Stephens, Nurse Beale, and Dr. Masters. Whew. Okay, ready for the plot?Dr. Stephens has let the patients of his asylum do as they please. Their main therapy is acting our their delusions. This, as obviously dangerous as it is, leads to the accidental death of Stephens. Then, shortly after the tragedy, comes the young (and equally sexy) Nurse Beale. Dr. Masters -- the female doctor who now in charge -- doesn't want her to become involved with her institution. Still, she allows Beale to join the staff of the sanatarium after a short debate. The new nurse soon learns the oddities of the inhabitants known as ""the family"" (the patients). In the long wait for action, the viewer is submitted to scene after scene of seemingly insignificant purposes. While most would say this majority of the movie would be boring and pointless, I rather enjoyed it (not all of the scenes assist the impact of the ending, but they are certainly interesting to see). Throughout the film a secret unfolds surrounding the sanatarium. Finally, as with most films like this, a few people mysteriously die. Shortly after, Mrs. Beale gets caught up in the horrors. And once the action begins, it doesn't slow down. Before long, Beale discovers the missing piece to the puzzle of Dr. Stephens and his asylum. The danger rises and rises until we are treated to the goriest part of the film: it's climax.Other reviews made this sound like a film with a clever and surprising ending. Nope. I found the ending quite predictable before the film was even half through. Don't Look In The Basement did not impress me with a shocking conclusion. It impressed me with an element that few B-movies have: true impact on the viewer. By the end, I was drawn into the world of the asylum and felt a sense of isolation and tragedy. It's like the end of the original Night Of The Living Dead: it wasn't that it was so shocking, it was that it gave the viewer a truly nihilistic feeling. You are not left with images of the film in your head, but rather the idea of it's entirety. It has the kind of empty feeling you got from the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. For a drive-in B-movie, Don't Look In The Basement delivers quite a surprise. Just not in the plot, but in the atmosphere it oozes with. This is quite a treat for such a low-end production.

465468,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,6305459452,Robert I. Hedges,"[4, 4]","""Don't Look in the Basement"" is a 1970s drive in movie so tasteless it was actually banned in Iceland. Despite that lucid and revealing indictment from the world's oldest democracy, this is one of the better ""inmates running the asylum"" slasher movies from the era, with some genuine creepiness and an occasional good performance, notably from Bill McGhee as Sam, a well-adjusted lobotomy victim.The asylum is run by Dr. Stephens who believes that it's important to allow patients to live out their fantasies, so a former army sergeant still dresses in fatigues and goes by ""Sarge,"" a would-be mother carries around a doll as if it were an actual infant, etc. There appear to be no safety regulations at this particular sanitarium as Dr. Stephens gets killed in the first five minutes of the film by a patient participating in some ax therapy with predictably poor results. Stephens' assistant, Dr. Masters, a horrible older woman (Annabelle Weenick, a.k.a. Anne MacAdams) takes over for him. Beautiful psychiatric nurse Charlotte Beale (played by April 1972 Playboy Playmate Rosie Holotik) appears and is not welcomed by Masters, who wants to makes some changes at the asylum.The film features a lot of atmospheric creepiness and interesting twists, and in that regard is superior to most of its contemporaries. There is more than a modicum of ambiguity in addition to the requisite lunatics, creepy dolls, and screaming in a movie of this ilk. The background for the bulk of the film is set during a lengthy exposition-laden scene in which Masters and Beale review the patient cases (there's Allyson, a nymphomaniacal woman with a rejection issue; Oliver W. Cameron, an appellate court judge; Mrs. Callingham, a woman who thinks flowers are her children; a redheaded idiot named Danny who has just about the most annoying screen presence in history, etc.) To develop the characters, the patients are seen interacting with each other for a while before the plot gets back in gear. I was especially amused by the scene where Allyson attempts to seduce Judge Cameron with poor results, though with some deliciously bad dialogue (""Ripe strawberries are the color of blood!"")After a bit of character familiarization, someone cuts the phone line, and strange things start to happen. First, Mrs. Callingham's tongue gets cut out. Dr. Masters believes she did it herself while hallucinating, which Charlotte totally buys into (she is beautiful, but not that bright). When a phone repair guy shows up to fix the line, Dr. Masters goes absolutely bonkers at the intrusion, and the phone repair guy gets an unhealthy exposure to Allyson.Sharp implements are not carefully controlled at this facility and Allyson soon finds a gigantic butcher knife, which she wields maniacally. After one patient gets a meat thermometer in the eye, Allyson reveals to Charlotte that Masters is actually a patient at the asylum: Stephens was merely indulging her medical control fantasy by letting her pretend to be a doctor before his untimely demise. This sets Charlotte to thinking about a means of escape. Unfortunately for our dense heroine, Masters has told the other patients that Charlotte is actually a patient, so a struggle for control of the minds of the crazies ensues.Sam, who has started approaching Charlotte about messages from Dr. Stephens, tells Charlotte to go look in the basement. Given the title of the film, I bet you're thinking that's a bad idea. You would be right. In an extremely confusing revelatory moment, Charlotte finds Stephens in the basement, but she is so startled by him (here's an idea: turn the lights on) that she hacks him to death. This enrages Sam, who carries Charlotte back up the stairs where Masters is preparing to lobotomize her. Flashing back to his own lobotomy, Sam has a moment of clarity, realizes that Charlotte is good and Masters is evil, and carries Charlotte outside while the other patients turn the ax on Masters. Sam then proceeds to vent his aggression via the ax on all his fellow inmates, and then in a completely unexpected and incongruous moment, calls Masters ""Mama"" repeatedly. (I didn't take this literally, though lobotomized patients normally don't speak figuratively.) Ultimately the film concludes with blood-spattered Sam enjoying a popsicle while a nice trumpet solo drifts across the soundtrack.I must admit that I'm not a particular fan of slasher films, and despite its placement in the horror genre, there is not that much gore by contemporary standards in this film. Most of the torment is emotional and mental, which I think makes the film more scary than if it was simply a gorefest. The film has certain flaws; the first half is slowly paced, some of the acting is embarrassingly poor, and the screaming got very annoying very quickly as it wasn't saved for when something actually scary was occurring. ""Don't Look in the Basement"" is not a prizewinning piece of cinema by any means and is sometimes downright distasteful, but as an example of 1970s early drive in horror, it's better than average and should be to the liking of fans of horror and slasher films.",3,Banned In Iceland,1221955200,"09 21, 2008",2008,5121,"['Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Basement', '1970s', 'drive', 'movie', 'so', 'tasteless',

Don't let the generic title or the probability that you've never heard of this movie deter you from watching it because it delivers rather satisfactorily. This is a very low budget horror film from 1973, starring no one you have ever seen before. Indeed, the acting is less than stellar, though it isn't bad and I have seen much, much worse. The lighting is rather poorly done, which isn't to say everything is dark; instead, everything seems to be lit by studio lights, or at least the first three-fourths of the movie are. That is about it for the negative aspects of the film, however. For the most part I found this to be a very pleasant surprise. The story, concerning a psychiatrist and the unorthodox methods he employs at his mental hospital, is quite good. Having forsworn lobotomies, after a botched operation, the good doctor develops an alternative methodology for treating disturbed individuals. He sees insanity as a complex series of obsessions, which can only be destroyed by a patient's own mental strength. Believing that no one is beyond help, he works with his patients to develop their strengths. Once he is no longer in a position to run the facility (and I won't say how), Dr. Masters assumes this responsibility. At this point, Nurse Beale arrives to begin her new position at the hospital and the viewer discovers the myriad characteristics of the place and its residents just as she does. I won't say this is very scary or a great movie by any means, though if you are looking for a pretty good story and can get past the unprofessional look of the movie, check it out.",4,Not bad at all,1161561600,"10 23, 2006",2006,1713,"['3.5/5', 'stars', 'alternate', 'title', 'film', 'Forgotten', 'fit', 'film', 'status', 'rather', 'well', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'generic', 'title', 'probability', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'movie', 'deter', 'watching', 'rather', 'satisfactorily', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'film', '1973', 'starring', 'one', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'before', 'Indeed', 'acting', 'less', 'stellar', ""n't"", 'bad', 'have', 'seen', 'much', 'much', 'worse', 'lighting', 'rather', 'poorly', 'done', ""n't"", 'say', 'everything', 'dark', 'instead', 'everything', 'be', 'lit', 'studio', 'lights', 'least', 'first', 'three-fourths', 'movie', 'are', 'negative', 'aspects', 'film', 'however', 'most', 'part', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'story', 'concerning', 'psychiatrist', 'unorthodox', 'methods', 'mental', 'hospital', 'quite', 'good', 'Having', 'forsworn', 'lobotomies', 'botched', 'operation', 'good', 'doctor', 'alternative', 'methodology', 'treating', 'disturbed', 'individuals', 'insanity', 'complex', 'series', 'obsessions', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'destroyed', 'patient', 'own', 'mental', 'strength', 'Believing', 'one', 'help', 'patients', 'develop', 'strengths', 'Once', 'no', 'longer', 'position', 'run', 'facility', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'how', 'Dr.', 'Masters', 'responsibility', 'point', 'Nurse', 'Beale', 'begin', 'new', 'position', 'hospital', 'viewer', 'myriad', 'characteristics', 'place', 'residents', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'very', 'scary', 'great', 'movie', 'means', 'are', 'looking', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'can', 'get', 'unprofessional', 'look', 'movie', 'check', 'out']",Don't Look in the Basement

Silly over-acting, low budget, made in the 70's, and the most important... a really wonderfully nasty leading lady, Dr. Masters! You already know the story, house for the loonies gets loonier as the movie goes on. Yes, but some of the characters are just fantasically crazy. The lady whose very protective of her baby(doll), the crazy old lady that thinks flowers are her children (not too mention all her wonderfully humerous warnings to nurse Charlotte to &quot;get out&quot;.), and of course Allyson, the sex starved weirdo that screams whenever given a chance. The highlight is the amazing Dr. Geraldine Masters. This woman is so great! She is a cross between Joan Crawford in &quot;Trog&quot; and Mrs. Voorhees in the 1st &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; film. She's a very direct woman indeed. Mean, nasty, will NOT be crossed. She goes on these little verbal tirades that leaves the viewer gasping for air, since she seems to ramble endlessly without taking a breath. I grew up watching this film on late night television in the late 70's/early 80's. As a child I was terribly affected by the scene in which Charlotte walks in on Allyson laying in bed with the dead telephone man, whom she refers to as her husband in this scene. It's still a bit disturbing. The worst of the actors is Charlotte, the nurse that arrives early in the film. She cannot deliver even the simplist line without it sounding hokey. The movie has a wonderful charm that keeps me coming back to it a few times a year, The DVD was a disappointment. Poor picture quality. Lots of scratches and spots, also has a blueish tone in the dark scenes. Still, better than VHS. Don't watch this for horror value, though it does have a little.

I am sorry to say I missed that dialogue in the movie, but I didn't miss the real point of this movie. It is about a very sick woman who suffers delusions of being in charge of the asylum and the whole community at large. After the management dies, she immediately assumes (arrogates unto herself) control of the whole operation as if she owns it.The most amazing thing of all is how absolutely convincing she is. I am embarrassed to admit that she even had me fooled into believing that she was in charge! Even when the patients begin frantically warning the visitors, I still didn't get it. It is a lesson in Sociology, which is why I write about it. She was so damn convincing it was as though she had actually made herself believe her own lie!Just imagine what would happen if this really happened, and someone with this same delusional personality disorder did the same thing in your home town, and opened up an asylum in which to act out her delusions of being in power!
