446548,AYQY3RB33F4J6,6305076464,3rdeadly3rd,"[68, 73]","""Fawlty Towers"", for those who have somehow not been exposed to it, is simply the most glorious example of the farce ever to be committed to television. ""Monty Python""'s John Cleese is Basil Fawlty, a snobbish, rude owner of a small hotel in Torquay. On staff are his wife Sybil (Prunella Scales) - a gregarious woman with the most amazing laugh in television history, receptionist Polly (Cleese's wife Connie Booth) - probably the only staff member with an ounce of common sense, and Manuel (the incomparable Andrew Sachs) - a Spanish waiter with severely limited English. Of the guests, Ballard Berkely delivers a wonderful performance as the not-quite-there Major.Each episode deals with Basil's various problems at the hotel, problems which he never fails to make much worse by saying the wrong thing at the wrong time, leaving Manuel in charge or generally being himself. The laughs ramp up to fever pitch very rapidly and each episode ends with rapturous cheers from the studio audience. There were only ever 12 episodes recorded of this classic series, but each one has incredible quality. As Cleese explains in part of his interview, attempting to equal the highlights of each series just got too much for the writers and performers.Here is a quick summary of the premise of each episode and what to watch for:""A Touch of Class"" - this was the first episode ever recorded and deals with Basil's attempt at attracting ""a better sort of clientele"" to the hotel. Watch for Basil's changing attitudes toward Lord Melbury and the man in the biker jacket, while the standout scene is Basil's seating of Lord Melbury ""in his usual seat"" in the dining room. Best line: ""A lemon squash, a gin and orange and a scotch and water please.""""The Builders"" - Basil's attempts at cost-cutting result in a drastically reconfigured hotel. Watch for Mr O'Reilly's Irish accent and Basil's monster double take at the renovations. Best lines: ""Where are your ears you halfwit? He no here - LISTEN"", ""Which of you is Man With Beard?"" and ""Door gone was here!""""The Wedding Party"" - Basil gets caught up in the fray as a large number of guests appear to be getting very close to each other. Watch for the drunken Manuel and Basil's rising blood pressure at the various couplings. Best lines: ""And I saw him...sitting on the waiter!"" and ""Leaving my three mothers"".""The Hotel Inspectors"" - Basil desperately tries to impress guests who he thinks are inspectors. Watch for the revelation of who everyone is.""Gourmet Night"" - Basil's attempt at a gourmet night goes horribly wrong. Watch for the ""beating the car"" scene (recently voted one of the funniest scenes ever). Best line: ""I warned you, you vicious bastard!""""The Germans"" - this is probably the best episode of the entire show. Sybil is in hospital and Basil ends up there as well, but then (still suffering the after-effects of a concussion) handles the arrival of some German guests. Watch for the Major's reaction to the ""talking moose"" and Basil's marvellous ""don't mention the war"" performance. Best lines: ""I speak eeengleesh very well. I learned eeet from a booook."", ""one Hermann Goering"" and ""well YOU started it!"".""Communication Problems"" - a deaf guest checks into the Hotel. Meanwhile, Basil needs to keep his gambling a secret. Watch for the ""your horse, he win"" scene and the incredible scene in which Manuel can't explain the source of the money. Best lines: ""Is this a piece of your brain?"", ""nitwit or dragonfly?"" and ""I know NOTHING.""""The Psychiatrist"" - Basil provides some great research material for two visiting psychiatrists. Watch for his shameless buttering-up of the doctors. Best line: ""Two doctors? How did you become two doctors?""""Waldorf Salad"" - an American attempts to order a Waldorf Salad from the chef. Watch for Basil playing both himself and the chef. Best lines: ""What's a waldorf anyway?"" and ""Whopee, let's all have an apple party!!""""The Kipper and the Corpse"" - a guest dies and Basil tries to prevent everyone else from finding out. Watch for the carrying-the-guest-up-and-down-the-stairs scene. Best line: ""I'm a doctor and I want my breakfast"".""The Anniversary"" - Basil infuriated Sybil by seemingly forgetting their wedding anniversary. Watch for his solution to the problem. Best line: ""Agincourt? Poitiers? Crecy?""""Basil The Rat"" - a health inspector's arrival is precipitated by Basil's discovery of Manuel's ""siberian hamster"". Watch for the look on Manuel's face as he puts out some food for his pet and Basil's ""celebration"" upon finding that the cat is alive. Best lines: ""Basil, Basil"", ""To spleep?"", ""He put Basil in the ratatouille?"", ""Pigin, like your English"" and ""no no, is hamster"".For die-hard fans, the third disc, containing interviews and outtakes is also more than worthwhile as a purchase.Enough praise cannot be given to this series. It should be compulsory viewing for anyone remotely interested in comedy.",5,The Manger's Faulty?

Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[6, 9]","If you were to look up some of the most hysterical moments on the BBC, you would no doubtably come across two names.  Those names would be John Cleese and Ricky Gervais.  While Gervais recently found comedy through his program called ""The Office"", Cleese has been providing wit, wisdom, and down-right hysteria for the past several decades.  While away from his namesake (Monty Python), you can find Cleese comfortable in several other roles that showcase his bubbling talent.  One of those programs just happens to be the funniest bit of crumpet called ""Fawlty Towers"".Remembering this show when I was a child and was on our local PBS station, I eagerly bought it when it was released on DVD about a year ago.  Since then, I have watched random episodes here and there but never fully taking in the enjoyment from watching it all.  So, today I decided to sit down and watch this series from beginning to end and I have yet to finish laughing.  If this program doesn't define comic genius, I don't know what does.  Never have I witnessed a show that has continually been fresh, hysterical (I cannot use that word enough), real, and outlandish all at the same time.  Normally, with our current television programming, you need to pick or choose which it will be, but thankfully ""Fawlty Towers"" is all of these and many more.Cleese remains in top form as Basil Fawlty, the owner/manager of the B&B; that just happens to have his hands and over-worked imagination in everything.  With the aid of his helpers Manuel (he's from Barcelona) and Polly (co-writer Connie Booth and ex-wife of Cleese), Cleese always seems to find himself in a heap of trouble with his wife Sybil (the dragon of the hotel).  Armed with physical humor and a snake-like banter, we witness everything from a dead body, hotel inspectors, a failed anniversary party, a moose head, and a Himalayan rodent of sorts happen to this simple, everyday, B&B.;  This is not only a few of the episodes you will find in the complete set, but also the daily stress that Basil finds himself falling into daily.This series, again, is hysterical.  Cleese is the master of his trade while proving that he can manage any task thrown in front of him.  While some will argue that he overshadows the rest of the cast, I would say ""hogwash"" to that.  My two favorite characters in this series were Major and Manuel.  The comedy that they provide cannot be found on television today.

He is a comedian who makes a nervous breakdown the funniest thing in the world. Then there is the marvelous Prunella Scales as Cybil, his wife and (as he calls her) his little puff adder. Andrew Sachs is great as the sweet but always confused Manuel (he's from Barcelona). And of course, Cleese's real life wife at the time and writing partner, Connie Booth as Polly who runs back and forth between the bickering Fawltys and usually manages to benefit herfelf in the process.The cast, as you can tell, is the reason it all works so well. For anyone who has never seen Fawlty Towers, it concerns the adventures of the staff and owners of the afore mentioned hotel. They have a talent for making a small problem into a full scale disaster until it blows up in Basil's face. And don't feel sorry for him either, he is a horrid person but a funny one.My favorite episode is also &quot;The Germans&quot; with Basil suffering from a concussion ordering Polly and Manuel not to mention the war to some German guests all the while doing impressions of Hitler and other insulting things. As the German guest put it, however did they win?The best tape in the set in the one with Communications Problems.

US viewers who may not have been exposed to it, may miss some of the more subtle aspects, but any fans of John Cleese, or more recently Mr Bean, will certainly find it memorable. It is NOT however Monty Python type material, for those expecting more outrageous, and off the wall satire. Basil Fawlty (Cleese) is the owner and operator of a modest seaside Hotel, and is more than ably supported by a great ensemble cast. Ever hen pecked by his domineering wife, often outsmarted, or assisted by his clever maid, and constantly frustrated by his pidgeon English speaking waiter, the results are hilarious, witty and very amusing. Some of the episodes can make the viewer cringe a little (at the frustrating aspects of Cleese's character) but the overall picture is enormously pleasing.

446563,A3Q7A9Y3S3BZO6,6305076464,Axayacatl,"[33, 37]","The superb quality of the writing and performances in this British comedy masterpiece is well documented in many places, so I will limit my review to the technical qualities of this DVD: Fawlty Towers - Complete Series.The content extras are great, including a few interviews, and the very entertaining short about the real Torquay and the eccentric innkeeper who inspired Cleese to develop the Fawlty Towers series (written together with Connie Booth, of course).I've had FT on video for many years. Six months ago I moved into a large loft and installed a front-projection home theater. My screen is 162&quot; diagonal (13.5'), which is just huge. It's incredible for enjoying high quality DVDs but the much lower quality limitations of VHS (low scan lines) makes most tapes very unsatisfying to watch on such a large screen system. (I have since set about replacing most of my favorite VHS tapes with DVDs, as available. And this brings me to the much anticipated release of Fawlty Towers on DVD.)I have encountered some DVD releases of television productions (1970's to 1990's) which were very disappointing in video quality. I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to enjoy the superior quality of DVD over VHS, since Fawlty Towers is from 1975-1979. But apparently the great popularity of this series in Britain led to outstanding preservation of high quality tape masters.I was surprised to see such high resolution and detail, great color rendition (for a TV production), and totally stable imaging (no shifts, jumps, skips, blips, etc).Considering its 1970's origin and that FT was produced for television, I would rate the video quality of this DVD at 10/10. I am extremely pleased, it's almost as good as film, and is absolutely at the top of its class when compared to virtually any other DVD releases of television programs from 10 years ago (or older). It's even better than a lot of poorly mastered DVDs of modern theatrical releases. They did an outstanding job digitizing FT from very high quality master tapes.With the sharpness and detail, aficionados of FT will enjoy seeing subtleties in the character's clothing, the wallpaper, titles on books &amp; magazines, times on clocks, and the intricate detail of all the sets and furnishings. And all of this detail will be new to you, since it was never possible on VHS. It's fascinating to enjoy these many nuances!!I've loved Fawlty Towers for more than 10 years. And this superb DVD couldn't be better. Now I can admire this comedic tour-de-farce for decades to come.Now if someone would just release &quot;The Rise &amp; Fall of Reginald Perrin&quot; in an equally well-mastered DVD set, my dreams would be one step closer to fulfillment. (And make that all 21 episodes please, not just the first two seasons). By the way, if you haven't discovered &quot;Reginald Perrin&quot;, starring Leonard Rossiter (also of &quot;Rising Damp&quot;), try to get a copy ... I think it's also a britcom masterpiece.",5,"Outstanding DVD video quality: detail, sharpness, color; A+",1006473600,"11 23, 2001",2001,2971,"['superb', 'quality', 'writing', 'performances', 'British', 'comedy', 'masterpiece', 'well', 'documented', 'many', 'places', 'will', 'limit', 'review', 'technical', 'qualities', 'DVD', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'Complete', 'Series.The', 'content', 'extras', 'are', 'great', 'including', 'few', 'interviews', 'very', 'entertaining', 'short', 'real', 'Torquay', 'eccentric', 'innkeeper', 'who', 'inspired', 'Cleese', 'develop', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'series', 'written', 'together', 'Connie', 'Booth', 'course', ""'ve"", 'had', 'FT', 'video', 'many', 'years', 'Six', 'months', 'moved', 'large', 'loft', 'installed', 'front-projection', 'home', 'theater', 'screen', '162', 'quot', 'diagonal', '13.5', 'just', 'huge', 'incredible', 'enjoying', 'high', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'much', 'lower', 'quality', 'limitations', 'VHS', 'low', 'scan', 'lines', 'most', 'tapes', 'very', 'unsatisfying', 'watch', 'large', 'screen', 'system', 'have', 'set', 'replacing', 'most', 'favorite', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'DVDs', 'available', 'much', 'anticipated', 'release', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'DVD', 'have', 'encountered', 'DVD', 'releases', 'television', 'productions', '1970', '1990', 'were', 'very', 'disappointing', 'video', 'quality', 'was', 'concerned', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'superior', 'quality', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', '1975-1979', 'apparently', 'great', 'popularity', 'series', 'Britain', 'led', 'outstanding', 'preservation', 'high', 'quality', 'tape', 'masters.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'such', 'high', 'resolution', 'detail', 'great', 'color', 'rendition', 'TV', 'production', 'totally', 'stable', 'imaging', 'shifts', 'jumps', 'skips', 'blips', 'etc', '.Considering', '1970', 'origin', 'FT', 'was', 'produced', 'television', 'would', 'rate', 'video', 'quality', 'DVD', '10/10', 'am', 'extremely', 'pleased', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'absolutely', 'top', 'class', 'when', 'compared', 'virtually', 'other', 'DVD', 'releases', 'television', 'programs', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'older', 'even', 'better', 'lot', 'poorly', 'mastered', 'DVDs', 'modern', 'theatrical', 'releases', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'digitizing', 'FT', 'very', 'high', 'quality', 'master', 'tapes.With', 'sharpness', 'detail', 'aficionados', 'FT', 'will', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'subtleties', 'character', 'clothing', 'wallpaper', 'titles', 'books', 'amp', 'magazines', 'times', 'clocks', 'intricate', 'detail', 'sets', 'furnishings', 'detail', 'will', 'be', 'new', 'was', 'never', 'possible', 'VHS', 'fascinating', 'enjoy', 'many', 'nuances', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'more', '10', 'years', 'superb', 'DVD', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'Now', 'can', 'admire', 'comedic', 'tour-de-farce', 'decades', 'come.Now', 'someone', 'would', 'just', 'release', 'quot', 'Rise', 'amp', 'Fall', 'Reginald', 'Perrin', 'quot', 'equally', 'well-mastered', 'DVD', 'set', 'dreams', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'step', 'closer', 'fulfillment', 'make', '21', 'episodes', 'please', 'not', 'just', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'way', 'have', ""n't"", 'discovered', 'quot', 'Reginald', 'Perrin', 'quot', 'starring', 'Leonard', 'Rossiter', 'also', 'quot', 'Rising', 'Damp', 'quot', 'try', 'get', 'copy', 'think', 'also', 'britcom', 'masterpiece']",N/A

The show is timeless.The DVD package gives you lots of nice extras, with interviews (old and new) with the main cast members, as well as a neat little cast and setting guide.

The price is also quite reasonable, so value for money is assured.Only 12 episodes of Fawlty Towers were ever made, and they are all in this package. It showcases the wit and charm of John Cleese, who plays an obnoxious hotel owner who does with several problems with guests. Believe it or not, it was inspired by a real hotel in England. The writing is razor sharp, and unlike most comedy shows, the jokes never get old.

Each of the regulars is a unique, fully realized character. It is the interplay between these characters (with each other and with Cleese) that makes the show. Compare it to some other comedy shows that have a ""star"" comedian as a lead. For example, Mork and Mindy. That is an example of a ""solo"" effort and is quite the opposite of Fawlty Towers. You don't see any of the characters in FT standing around laughing at some Cleese antic and looking like they forgot their lines or missed their cue. In FT all the actors stay in character and are generally essential to the scene they are in.It is agreed that this is not the place if you are looking for something ""genuinely thought-provoking"" (as that other reviewer wished for). But then again, neither are any of the Monty Python movies (despite that other reviewer's belief). So yes, FT is a farce, but farce is an honorable art form. Just ask William Shakespeare and Geoffrey Chaucer, for starters.Fawlty Towers is one of the funniest, most tightly-scripted shows ever on TV.

The trials and tribulations of Mr. Fawlty are widely recognized as some of the best comedy TV ever made, and for good reason.  For better or worse, the series didn't have to stand up to the test of 100+ episodes, but the 12 they did make are absolutely priceless.It usually starts out with a simple problem, usually a result of Basil's contempt for his customers (a recurring theme is his desire to attract a ""higher class"" of boarder) or his tight-fistedness.  The problem is then exacerbated by the help or the customers or by Basil's wife, resulting in total disaster and Fawlty's inevitable descent into hysterics.  If there's one thing that John Cleese can do well it's pitch a fit, and he does this with hilarious efficiency throughout the series.  Whether it be because his car has broken down or there's a dead man in the hotel, Cleese's gift for physical comedy is on display in all its glory.  The supporting cast is also excellent. There's the bellhop Manuel, whose failure to grasp the English language (along with his pet rat) makes for some interesting situations. Then there's Basil's wife, who recognizes Basil's knack for heaving himself headlong off the ship of reasonable behavior, and has long since stopped throwing him a rope.  Finally, there's Polly, the maid, who is the most reasonable person at the hotel, but always gets involved as an accomplice in someone's shenanigans.  And let's not forget the patrons of Fawlty Towers, who run the gamut from perfectly reasonable to psychotic (the Waldorf Salad guy comes to mind) to dead.  All these elements, along with the talent of the cast, combine to make for great situational comedyThis is truly an original TV classic, and the humor and writing is so well done that it deserves to be seen over and over again.",5,Fantastically hilarious!!!!,1051142400,"04 24, 2003",2003,1926,"['John', 'Cleese', 'Basil', 'Fawlty', 'cranky', 'English', 'innkeeper', 'who', 'misery', 'job', 'determined', 'help', 'everyone', 'else', 'find', 'as', 'well', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'Mr.', 'Fawlty', 'are', 'widely', 'recognized', 'best', 'comedy', 'TV', 'ever', 'made', 'good', 'reason', 'better', 'worse', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'stand', 'up', 'test', '100+', 'episodes', '12', 'did', 'make', 'are', 'absolutely', 'priceless.It', 'usually', 'out', 'simple', 'problem', 'usually', 'result', 'Basil', 'contempt', 'customers', 'recurring', 'theme', 'desire', 'attract', 'higher', 'class', 'boarder', 'tight-fistedness', 'problem', 'then', 'exacerbated', 'help', 'customers', 'Basil', 'wife', 'resulting', 'total', 'disaster', 'Fawlty', 'inevitable', 'descent', 'hysterics', 'one', 'thing', 'John', 'Cleese', 'can', 'do', 'well', 'pitch', 'fit', 'hilarious', 'efficiency', 'series', 'be', 'car', 'broken', 'down', 'dead', 'man', 'hotel', 'Cleese', 'gift', 'physical', 'comedy', 'display', 'glory', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'excellent', 'bellhop', 'Manuel', 'failure', 'grasp', 'English', 'language', 'pet', 'rat', 'interesting', 'situations', 'Then', 'Basil', 'wife', 'who', 'Basil', 'knack', 'heaving', 'headlong', 'ship', 'reasonable', 'behavior', 'long', 'stopped', 'throwing', 'rope', 'Finally', 'Polly', 'maid', 'who', 'most', 'reasonable', 'person', 'hotel', 'always', 'involved', 'accomplice', 'someone', 'shenanigans', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'patrons', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'who', 'run', 'gamut', 'perfectly', 'reasonable', 'psychotic', 'Waldorf', 'Salad', 'guy', 'mind', 'dead', 'elements', 'talent', 'cast', 'combine', 'make', 'great', 'situational', 'comedyThis', 'truly', 'original', 'TV', 'classic', 'humor', 'writing', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'be', 'seen', 'over', 'again']",N/A

446581,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,6305076464,Caleb Williams,"[1, 2]","Fawlty Towers is one of those British sitcoms that although they haven't a high number of episodes, the quality alone is something to make it a timeless classic. I think the high number of people who wil gladly vouch for how good this sitcom is only expresses the true quality of the comedy and the cast involved. The characters are well defined and the setting is utilised to its full potential. Only 13 episodes were made but managed to gain such a cult following, those 13 episodes were just enough to keep the likes of Basil Fawlty a household name for over 30 years. Only the likes of Del Boy and Rodney have gained such a heightened level of comedic status.The story is simple, Fawlty Towers is a hotel owned and managed by Basil Fawlty (John Cleese) and his wife sybil (Prunella Scales). Basil is supported by his hotel cleaner and waitress Polly (Connie Booth) and his bellboy and waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs). The cast blend together brilliantly and have given us some of the funniest TV moments we're ever likely to see in our lifetime. Basil is the typical stressed out middle aged man, he goes on by letting lifes little troubles ware him down. He constantly tries to be the man about the hotel but constantly has his masculinity taken away from him by the scorn of Sybil.John Cleese has always been a man I've considered as one of my idols, and this sitcom is the reason behind that. The comedy may be very slapstick, politically incorrect and at times very childish. I can't explain it but it all just seems to work in a way that will have you in fits of laughter no matter how many times you watch. The character of Basil is shockingly brilliant, I don't think anyone else could have played the character to such a level like John Cleese has. He is over the top, slick, stupid and physically funny. One of the best episodes that shows Cleese's physical prowess when playing this role is the infamous episode ""The Germans"" which spawned the line ""Don't mention the war."" The Hitler impression is something to be witnessed and regardless of whether you find things like that offensive or not, you just have to laugh.Basil Fawlty is everything we find funny about people who lose their temper. He has his moments of trying to hide such terrible situations from his wife, but because of those attempts at hiding the problems he only manages to make them worse. The best example of this is when Sybil wants some building work done on the hotel, she wants to use a well respected but expensive builder. He wants to have a friend to do it on the cheap but he is anything but respectful. While Sybil is away for a weekend, Basil goes against her wishes and has his friend do it with disastrous consequences. What follows is a hysterical attempt at hiding the tragic building work from his wife by trying to keep her out of the hotel.It's a fantastic series and I could honestly go on talking about it forever. I have nothing but good things to say about every cast member and their respective characters. John Cleese is a legend and he is one of a kind, he made the character his own and would have been something nobody else could have done. I would recommend this set to anyone with even a decent sense of humour.",5,Never Gets Old,1225065600,"10 27, 2008",2008,3222,"['Fawlty', 'Towers', 'one', 'British', 'sitcoms', 'have', ""n't"", 'high', 'number', 'episodes', 'quality', 'alone', 'something', 'make', 'timeless', 'classic', 'think', 'high', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'wil', 'gladly', 'vouch', 'how', 'good', 'sitcom', 'only', 'true', 'quality', 'comedy', 'cast', 'involved', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'defined', 'setting', 'utilised', 'full', 'potential', 'Only', '13', 'episodes', 'were', 'made', 'managed', 'gain', 'such', 'cult', 'following', '13', 'episodes', 'were', 'just', 'enough', 'keep', 'likes', 'Basil', 'Fawlty', 'household', 'name', '30', 'years', 'Only', 'likes', 'Del', 'Boy', 'Rodney', 'have', 'gained', 'heightened', 'level', 'comedic', 'status.The', 'story', 'simple', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'hotel', 'owned', 'managed', 'Basil', 'Fawlty', 'John', 'Cleese', 'wife', 'sybil', 'Prunella', 'Scales', 'Basil', 'supported', 'hotel', 'cleaner', 'waitress', 'Polly', 'Connie', 'Booth', 'bellboy', 'waiter', 'Manuel', 'Andrew', 'Sachs', 'cast', 'blend', 'together', 'brilliantly', 'have', 'given', 'funniest', 'TV', 'moments', ""'re"", 'ever', 'likely', 'see', 'lifetime', 'Basil', 'typical', 'stressed', 'out', 'middle', 'aged', 'man', 'letting', 'lifes', 'little', 'troubles', 'ware', 'down', 'constantly', 'be', 'man', 'hotel', 'constantly', 'masculinity', 'taken', 'away', 'scorn', 'Sybil.John', 'Cleese', 'always', 'been', 'man', ""'ve"", 'considered', 'one', 'idols', 'sitcom', 'reason', 'comedy', 'may', 'be', 'very', 'slapstick', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'times', 'very', 'childish', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'just', 'work', 'way', 'will', 'have', 'fits', 'laughter', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'watch', 'character', 'Basil', 'shockingly', 'brilliant', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'character', 'level', 'John', 'Cleese', 'top', 'slick', 'stupid', 'physically', 'funny', 'One', 'best', 'episodes', 'Cleese', 'physical', 'prowess', 'when', 'playing', 'role', 'infamous', 'episode', 'Germans', 'spawned', 'line', 'Do', ""n't"", 'mention', 'war', 'Hitler', 'impression', 'something', 'be', 'witnessed', 'regardless', 'find', 'things', 'offensive', 'not', 'just', 'have', 'laugh.Basil', 'Fawlty', 'everything', 'find', 'funny', 'people', 'who', 'lose', 'temper', 'moments', 'trying', 'hide', 'such', 'terrible', 'situations', 'wife', 'attempts', 'hiding', 'problems', 'only', 'make', 'worse', 'best', 'example', 'when', 'Sybil', 'building', 'work', 'done', 'hotel', 'use', 'well', 'respected', 'expensive', 'builder', 'have', 'friend', 'do', 'cheap', 'anything', 'respectful', 'Sybil', 'away', 'weekend', 'Basil', 'wishes', 'friend', 'do', 'disastrous', 'consequences', 'What', 'hysterical', 'attempt', 'hiding', 'tragic', 'building', 'work', 'wife', 'trying', 'keep', 'hotel.It', 'fantastic', 'series', 'could', 'honestly', 'go', 'talking', 'forever', 'have', 'nothing', 'good', 'things', 'say', 'cast', 'member', 'respective', 'characters', 'John', 'Cleese', 'legend', 'one', 'kind', 'made', 'character', 'own', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'nobody', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'would', 'recommend', 'set', 'anyone', 'even', 'decent', 'sense', 'humour']",N/A

Everyone else is the straight man to Cleese in this uproarious series.  If Basil Fawlty thinks you are an English lord staying in his Inn, he is all boot licking, fawning obnoxiousness personified.  He literally falls all over the lord as he is a genius at taking a pratfall.  If he thinks you are a lower class nobody muscling in on his Inn, he is totally obnoxious as the worst sort of English snob, nose in the air. He does his best to ignore you and if you can't be ignored, he delivers devastating put downs, one-liners which are classics in the genre.  You are just as likely to find Fawlty pawing through some guest's room (and about to be caught) as you are to find him skulking in the office trying to avoid front desk duties or making mayhem in the dining room, usually trying to favor one diner over another with his snobbish judgments.Prunella Scales delivers the voice of reason, his wife, flawlessly.  Manuel, the barely English speaking bellhop is a bit reminiscent of Roberto Benigni in his most comic roles.  Polly the maid is a co-writer with Cleese of the show. She is so convincing as a maid that it is hard to believe she is a brilliant writer in real life.But Cleese is the star all the way and I've always been sad there were only 12 episodes.

This newly-remastered collection of the classic BBC comedy series will have you laughing like almost nothing else!I'd had surprisingly little exposure to Fawlty Towers until fairly recently. Back when I was a wee lad I remember seeing about two episodes of the show. Lately I've seen a heck of a lot more and found it to be one of the best, most consistently funny shows ever made!The series follows the lives of people staying and working in Fawlty Towers, what is possibly the worst hotel in all of England. It's located on the British coast where, it turns out, people actually voluntarily go for vacations during the summer (having swam in the Pacific Ocean in an area just about as far north as Southern England, I think they're quite mad). The hotel is run by the impossible-to-deal-with Basil Fawlty (John Cleese). With him are his long-suffering wife, longer-suffering maid and even longer-suffering Spanish bellhop, the scene stealing Manuel (Andrew Sachs).The plots tend to be very simple, and occasionally reveal a great deal about the age of the show (it was made in 1975 and 1979), but the execution is genius. The comic timing on display is incredible, particularly that of Sachs and Cleese.This newly remastered version of the show contains all twelve episodes (12?! That's it?! Not a lot, I know, but the recent great shows The Office and Extras also only have twelve standard episodes each), of the show. You also get a whole raft of extra features, including commentaries, interviews, outtakes, a little booklet and even a Torquay Tourist Guide! Nice!This is a very funny show and a heck of a good deal.

Written by John Cleese of Monty Python fame, and his wife at the time, Connie Booth, they tell the story of a hapless innkeeper in Torquay &quot;in the English Riviera.&quot;  Every denison of Fawlty Towers is a caricature on a British stereotype, and the guests introduce some Americans, Australians, Greeks, etc., which are also suitable caricatures of their respective countries.  This series was obviously made before the era of political correctness, and is all the better for it.This series is not a repackaged version of Monty Python.  While maintaining the same high energy, it is much more a traditional sitcom.  It's been my experience that Monty Python fans think the series is excellent, and that many people who hate Monty Python also like it - it's much more universal.There are notable quotables too numerous to mention, as well as some very funny physical humour.  The replay value of the episodes is very high - I've had this set a couple of years and have seen every episode numerous times, but I still can pop in a tape and laugh out loud at the antics.  On this version, there are also interviews with John Cleese talking about the origins of the series as well as the inspiration for the specific events and plots of each episode.  While informative once, I always skip over them now.  It would have been nice to have seen some of the other cast members (especially Booth) in these interviews, but it's not to be.Thus, this set is highly recommended for any fan of the show.

White,"[10, 12]","I've watched the entire run of Fawlty Towers dozens of times and I laugh harder each time.Picture and sound quality are great, considering the age of the material.  I'm no expert on video, but I think some folks are being a little picky.  These programs were produced over 20 years ago for TV.  The exteriors were done on 16mm film and the interiors were done on video tape.  This was not a theatrical release.  It looks to me like some work has been done on the shows, as they look and sound better than any PBS broadcast that I've seen.The extras are great, with the exception of the first 6 commentaries by John Howard Davies.  It sounds as if Davies hasn't viewed these for years and remembered very little.  As a result, most of these commentaries consist of a lot of heavy breathing, sniffing, and slurping. He makes a comment about every 5 or 10 minutes on average. Still, Davies' noises can be amusing, especially at 3 in the morning! The last 6 commentaries by Bob Spiers are much better.  Spiers does far more talking and actually seems to have some memory of the shows he directed.  It would have been nice if the BBC had offered John Cleese a big pile of money to do commentaries for these shows.  Eric Idle was once quoted as saying that Cleese would do anything for money - He once offered him a pound to shut up &amp; Cleese took it!  Cleese probably would have done a commentary...for a price.The interviews on the discs are great.  Each disc contains a different interview with John Cleese, which are about 20 minutes each.  Disc 2 has an interview with Andrew Sachs who was Manuel. The interview is nearly a half hour and Sachs is very witty and entertaining.  Disc 3's interview with Prunella Scales (Sybil Fawlty) is good, but very short.There are also a couple of great documentaries: One about the Gleneagles Hotel &amp; Donald Sinclair who Fawlty Towers &amp; Basil Fawlty are based, as well as a brief featurette about the building that acted as the exterior for Fawlty Towers and the fire that destroyed the building in the 1990's.  There are also about 5 minutes or so of mildly amusing outtakes.So, sit back have a Kipper or a Waldorf Salad and enjoy some great comedy.

Jenkins,"[2, 3]","Much as I am loathe to start off with a cliche, cliches are cliches because they're true.As many have said, Fawlty Towers is the single funniest TV series ever created. There's no argument, and no other series even comes close. It's like comparing the Beatles to other bands or Jimi Hendrix to other guitarists. Some artists just exist in their own singular dimension, and it's true of this show. What does one say, that it's the Mount Everest of television comedy? More like the rings of Saturn...This masterpiece is given its proper honor in this fine box set, loaded with lengthy extras. The most surprising of these is the contemporary interview with Prunella Scales, revealing her to be a warm, charming and very sweet woman, which of course hammers home what a remarkable performance she gave in every episode of the show. And the same is true of the interview with Andrew Sachs, the immortal and incomparable Manuel.Currently offered at a steep discount by Amazon, the price is in fact irrelevant. The set is worth twice, three times the cost, even if and perhaps especially if you've lived with the show since your youth. Every minute is just perfection, especially in terms of the writing, the quality of which is off the scale. And in every episode, episodes you may have seen dozens of times over the decades, there are countless laugh out loud scenes... even in cases where you know every line, where you anticipate every punch line, every fall, every double-take.Most comedy doesn't bear up well to repeated playing but that's not the case here. Fawlty Towers is like a piece of great music, a classic album, in that its appeal never ends and in fact grows on the listener. It flourishes, it unfolds. In watching these episodes you see little things you never saw before, nuances of delivery that escaped you... and again, it's the writing... you relish every syllable, and if writing means something to you, you find yourself in awe of these scripts for there's not a line wasted.I know, this review seems excessive in its praise, but I'll just end with the delicious fact that the British Film Institute named Fawlty Towers as the #1 Television Program of All Time.Sheer unadulterated and relentless GENIUS.",5,TEN Stars.

Gorman  &#34;Crystalline Structure Moon&#34;,"[2, 3]","In this spectacular BritCom, Monty Python's John Cleese stars as a disgruntled hotel owner named Basil Fawlty.  He cowrote the show with then-wife Connie Booth, who plays the maid, Polly Sherman.  Cleese and Booth divorced after Season 1, and it took a while 'til they could work together again to write and star in Season 2.  After that, they could not work together anymore, and it's a real shame that only 2 seasons of this brilliant comedy was ever made.  Prunella Scales plays Fawlty's wife, Sybill, a bit of a shrew who always has more important things to do than helping to run the hotel.  And Andrew Sachs plays the mousy Spanish bellhop, Manuel, who tries to be a good employee, but his efforts are hampered by the fact that he doesn't speak English.  Basil is short-tempered, rude to the guests, trying to raise the hotel's standards while remaining cheap and overall, unpleasant.  Guests range from brazen French women, obnoxious Americans, people who think their dogs are people, senile retired Army Majors, confidence tricksters, old ladies who complain about everything but refuse to turn on their hearing aids, and people who have the nerve to die in bed overnight.  Also they have to deal with hotel inspectors, drunken gay gourmet chefs, snobs, incompetent builders/construction workers and the health department...not to mention a psychiatrist, and even Germans!

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Nothing really needs to be said about this classic British sitcom, except that it contains some of the most brilliant, most hilarious, and most humiliatingly ghastly moments in the entire history of television.And ""Fawlty Towers Complete Collection"" brings together the entire series in all its embarrassing avalanchal glory. It's one of those universally funny TV shows, all about the undignified exploits of a perpetually hostile, repressed and tetchy hotel manager, and the more competant staff who try to keep thngs sane, written with demented zeal (""That's Brahms! Brahms' Third Racket!"") and excellent comic acting.Basil (John Cleese) and Sybil Fawlty (Prunella Scales) run a moderately-sized hotel in Torquay, with the assistance of the clever waittress Polly (Connie Booth) and the Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs) whose grasp of English is a work in progress. The hotel is home to a dotty old soldier, fluttery spinsters, and a revolving door of very dissatisfied customers.Basil Fawlty (Cleese) puts out a snotty ad to attract a ""better class of customer,"" which attracts a pleasant aristocrat. Basil fawns revoltingly over the man, neglecting the other guests. But savvy waittress Polly (Connie Booth) discovers that another guest (who Basil snubs because he's Cockney) is a member of the CID -- and that Basil is in danger of handing his valuable coins over to a con man.And it's not the last disaster that Basil only manages to make much worse: an inept gang of builders are called in while Sybil is away; a bunch of couples seem to be cheating on one another; four Germans arrive at the hotel just in time for Basil to suffer a brain-scrambling head injury; a deaf woman causes general hotel mayhem; and the creme-de-la-creme of Torquay society arrive for a ""Goumet Night,"" just in time for the chef to get drunk after Manuel rejects his advances. Hilarity (and roast ducks) ensue.An American tourist who demands a Waldorf salad -- after the cook leaves for the day -- ends up tangled in Basil's web of lies; an overnight guest expires in bed, leading to a frantic cover-up; an anniversary party is wrecked when Sybil storms out just as the guests arrive. And after a health inspector condemns Fawlty Towers, Basil discovers that Manuel has a pet rat (""Is Siberian hamster -- a filagree!"") -- which is soon running wild through the hotel.Anyone who's sick of the recycled sitcoms (""Hot Young Urbanites Fall In Love and Have Misadventures"") that pepper the TV landscape every single season might want to try ""Fawlty Towers"" -- the humour is still fresh, the writing is hilarious (""If the guest isn't singing 'Oh What a Beautiful Morning,' I don't immediately think 'Oh, there's another snuffed it in the night'""), and the actors were great at physical comedy.Basically every episode is about a bad situation that Basil makes infinitely worse, until the entire episode is a landslide of lies, offenses and disasters. Each episode is full of gags (Basil strangling the gnome), misunderstandings (""There's a kipper sticking out of your vest""), and plots that revolve mainly around Basil's increasingly frantic efforts to keep everything ""normal."" Everything gets crazier as the episodes wind on.And Cleese's writing is typically brilliant here -- Basil gets most of the great lines (""Always reminds me of somebody machine-gunning a seal"""") but there are some glorious bits of dialogue from others (""Will you stop talking about the war?"" ""Me? You started it!"" ""We did not start it!"" ""Yes you did -- you invaded Poland!"").Cleese plays Basil as a slightly deranged, high-strung, incompetent guy who treats his customers like so many itchy spots, and Prunella Scales serves as the more competent, vaguely contemptuous counterpoint to him. Connie Booth's Polly is the only truly smart and clever person in the entire hotel, and usually gets sucked into Basil's freaky schemes (""Flying Tart!""); and Andrew Sachs is rather cute and sweet as the much-abused Manuel, whose half-learned English provides quite a bit of humor (""I am from Barcelona!"").The new edition may be worth the dip for fanatical Fawlty fans -- apparently the entire series is being restored. Additionally, Cleese has gone back to record commentaries for ALL the episodes, and there are interviews with everybody in the main cast.

There are only twelve episodes, but how could there be anymore?Fawlty Towers is just so well written and filled with so much comedy it would probably have been impossible for the high standard of these shows to have continued. I was fortunate enough to have met John Cleese and work with him for about a week on a film. I asked him after he mentioned he'd like to do more television whether he'd ever make more Fawlty Towers. Cleese responded that he couldn't because more episodes could never live up to the public's expectations. I believe that he is absolutely correct.The show has various types of comedy, but I believe farce is the main ingredient. Although there is a non-Spaniard playing Manuel the Spanish waiter, who speaks little English and understands less the character is show in a sympathetic light. He is not being made fun  of because he is a foreigner. In fact, the person who comes off the worst in this show is Basil Fawlty himself! Every nationality - almost - is made sport of in the show. Americans, Japanese and Norweigens, Irish, Greeks, French, Germans and most especially the English.Literally there are laughs all around. There is ample helpings of the comedy of embarrassment, the deaf, senile, homosexual, upper class, lower class, the dead, old people, children, and psychiatrists are all made fun of.

What makes &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; so great is its simultaneous mastery of both high and low comedy. You get witty references to Brahms and Wittgenstein, soon followed by poked eyes and grabbed bosoms. Basil Fawlty is not only a triumph of comic writing and acting but also one of the most trenchant satires of the British character ever created. (Imagine if Carroll O'Connor had personally written &quot;All in the Family&quot; and you'll get an idea of the scope of Cleese's accomplishment here.) The supporting cast is as nearly as strong as that of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; (very high praise): the terrifying Prunella Scales as Lady Macbeth-in-a-bouffant-wig, the lovely Connie Booth (who you'd never guess was American) as the hidden brains of the outfit, and the superb Andrew Sachs as the world's worst bellhop. &quot;The Germans&quot; is probably the funniest half-hour of television ever filmed but all twelve episodes are gems.According to a fan website, there are at least half a dozen real-life hotels that have named themselves after Fawlty Towers.

446621,A1LOMQ24ZB1TBN,6305076464,EtherealCereal,"[10, 23]","Being a Python fan and a fan of some other British comedies (Good Neighbors, Are You Being Served), I was very pleased to find this complete DVD set at a used store that I shop at. Once I got it home and started watching, however, it was very clear that this type of comedy was made for people with certain tolerances. Fawlty Towers fans, I expect to get flamed for this, so flame away. The criticism I will try to make is going to be based on logic, not rants.First, the main character, Basil Fawlty, played by Cleese. Basil was modeled after an experience Cleese and the other Pythons had with an extremeely foul-tempered hotel owner while on holiday. Basil is brash, rude, inconsiderate, and generally painful to watch. He is a complete and utter wanker to his guests unless they are of some high social standing. Once in a while, we see Basil get his comeuppance from an overly irritated guest, or something of the like, and that's actually enjoyable, as he usually gets thumped pretty severely. Every person at one time or another has wanted to do that to someone as utterly nasty as Basil.Comedian Richard Briers said in his interview on the 'Good Neighbors' series that to be a comedy actor you had to exude a certain amount of vulnerability so that the the audience would care about you. Cleese's character of Basil evokes no sympathy or empathy whatsoever, as you find it impossible to relate to a man who is so deliberately narcissistic, sarcastic, and rude to his guests. Perhaps this is why John Cleese hates Britain so much, for those few individuals who are so class-conscious that they constantly trod on other people.Secondly, the cast. There does not seem to be any chemistry between most of the leading actors, and most of the acting seems forced, not to mention the gags. The only saving grace is Manuel the waiter, played by Andrew Sachs. There is a lot of byplay involving his difficulty communicating with the customers (and Basil) because of his difficulty learning the language.This series was one that I really wanted to like, and it fell very short .It's a shame they only made four seasons of Good Neighbors, as it was a fine Britcom.

They often have the feeling of being thrown together at the last minute, or are typically filled with predictable, contrived, and unchallenging humor, or are simply hollow vehicles for advertising to help put viewers ""in the buying mood."" These trends seem to be evolving more in favor of the advertiser than the viewing public, so it's refreshing to see that something wonderful can be done with the sitcom medium.Fawlty Towers is a meticulously written and acted British sitcom in which nearly every line and movement delivers a laugh. In the realm of the sitcom it has no equals, which also explains why only 12 episodes were produced. At the rate at which most sitcoms (British or North American)are shucked out it's just not possible to consistently crank out material of this quality. Each episode on these DVDs is the result of months of research, drafting, writing, rehearsing and editing. John Cleese was offered to do the series in the United States, but interest waned when Cleese told them how long each episode takes to produce. Sitcom producers generally don't have the patience for hardcore quality material.The show is set in a British Hotel that is run by a racist snob (Basil Fawlty played by John Cleese) who, once he discovers that someone is a Lord or a Doctor or someone of ""importance"", he stops being rude to them and takes on a disgusting deference. This theme alone drives almost half of the episodes. Other episodes deal with racism (between the English, Germans, Indians, etc.), Basil's weakness for parsimony or gambling, health inspectors, removing a corpse from a hotel indiscreetly, and the classic misunderstanding.For first time viewers of Fawlty Towers, if any of the humor seems stale it's likely because it's been badly imitated somewhere else. Don't blame Fawlty Towers for this. In many ways it set the standard (though never exceeded) for sitcoms after it. Entire series were built off of one idea presented in one episode of Fawlty Towers (i.e., the 'misunderstanding' in ""The Wedding Party"" was probably the entire inspiration for years of second-rate ""Three's Company"" episodes).""The Germans"" is probably one of the best shows ever made, though it's not for the PC-sensitive. Racial slurs abound (so I won't quote from it) and Basil, with a head injury, continually makes references to World War II while serving a group of German tourists. No, it's not nice or culturally sensitive, but as the saying goes, ""If it's funny, someone's probably going to get hurt."" It's only television after all, which usually gets taken far more seriously than it deserves.If there is anything negative to say about this collection, it's the bonus features. The interviews are great but the production quality is dreadful (did they hash these out to interns?). Bizarre and sometimes out of focus camera angles look more careless than experimental. At one point the camera outright violates John Cleese's personal space. If you can ignore the bad production, the interviews with John Cleese, Prunella Scales (who played Basil's wife), and Andrew Sachs (an English actor who played Manuel, the ""Spanish"" waiter who provides an incredible amount of comic relief, which I guess technically counts as ""brownface"") are a great watch. The only one missing is Connie Booth, who co-wrote the series and who's input is sorely missed.Also included, though again badly produced, is a documentary about the origin of Fawlty Towers.

446631,A2VE83MZF98ITY,6305076464,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[7, 10]","Come visit the worst-run hotel in the whole of western Europe (well, except for that place in Eastbourne...)In a field with many top contenders, 'Fawlty Towers' remains my favourite of all 'Britcoms' - situation comedies originating on British television.  Fawlty Towers has a cult following decades after the originals aired; it is sometimes hard to believe that there are but 12 episodes, six hours total.  The regular cast is led by John Cleese, veteran of the famous Monty Python comedy troupe, as the irrepressible Basil Fawlty, titular head of the hotel with dreams of class and glory; Prunella Scales is his long-suffering and hardworking wife, Sybil, who recognises that while Basil may think 'the sky's the limit!', in fact, '22 rooms is the limit'.  Connie Booth (Cleese's real-life wife) played the level-headed and sensible, overworked maid Polly, and in a role matched only by Fawlty's own bizarre manner, Andrew Sachs plays the loveable and ever-incompetent Spanish waiter, Manuel (he's from Barcelona...).  Ballard Berkeley makes a regular appearance as the Major, a retired long-term resident at the hotel.  Brian Hall joined the cast for the second season as the not-quite-gourmet chef, Terry.From the very first episode (first aired in 1975) featured a social-climbing Fawlty as perhaps the most rude and insufferable hotel manager in existence, in the resort town of Torquay, on the Channel coast of Britain.  Sybil tries to maintain a reasonable level of service, but Fawlty's snobbishness permits him to be gracious (indeed, excessively fawning) toward those he considers 'worthy', which in this episode turns out to be Lord Melbury, who ends up not being Lord Melbury, but rather a confidence trickster, and Fawlty's revenge scares away the real 'posh' guests, whom Fawlty sends off with the hilarious shout, 'Snobs!'In each of the episodes, there is a crisis - one gets the sense that the life of Fawlty is non-stop crisis, with his wife and Polly forever picking up the pieces, Manuel always complicating things, and the others wandering around in a state of disbelief (or, in the case of the Major, perpetual daze).  The twelve episodes highlight all the things that could wrong at hotel in classic comedic fashion - the institution of a Gourmet Night falls flat when the not-quite-recovering alcoholic chef starts drinking the night of the main event; a guest dies in the middle of the night, and Fawlty tries to slip him out unnoticed; remodelers install and remove the wrong doors; the health inspector unexpected shows up and gets served a bit of rat with his cheese.However, nothing quite matches the kinds of situations Basil can get himself into.  When trying to plan a surprise anniversary dinner for his wife, she leaves the hotel thinking that Basil has forgotten again, and Basil dresses Polly up as a sick-bed-bound Sybil to fool the guests.  When Polly's friends check in for a wedding over the weekend, Basil suspects the group of free sexual expression (highlighting his own repression); this theme is carried over to a glorious extreme in the episode about the visiting Psychiatrist.'How does he make his living?' Basil protests.  'He makes his money by sticking his nose into others' private parts, er, details...'This is also the episode where Sybil finally confronts Basil about his double-sided hotel manner toward guests: 'You're either crawling all over them, licking their boots, or spitting poison at them like some Benzedrine puff adder,' she declares.  He replies in perfect form, 'Just trying to enjoy myself, dear.'As the psychiatrist will comment near the end, there's enough material for an entire psychiatrist conference.  Indeed there is, as this is slapstick humour with a difference.  Intelligent and witty while utterly chaotic and beyond the pale, one is treated to the moose-head incident and the ingrowing toenail as well as Fawlty's unique form of automobile motivation (how many of us have ever been tempted to whack away at a stalled car with a stick!) and a nice performance of Brahms (his 'third racket', to be precise).  One must not overlook the little details, either, including the ever-changing sign in front (the actual hotel used for the exteriors unfortunately burned down many years after the show), and the fact that the interior and exterior layouts of the building cannot correspond (shades of 'The Simpsons' whose furniture layout changes from scene to scene).It is almost inconceivable that the two series, each of six episodes, were four years apart (1975 and 1979), as they flow rather seamlessly together.  Popular on television networks worldwide, it can be seen variously on BBC America and local public television channels, often during the fund drives, when the most popular pieces are shown.The DVD has various extras, including interviews with Cleese, Scales and Sachs (Booth was not available); there are director's commentaries as well as a tour of the now-abandoned hotel used for the exterior (a rather bizarre piece, that).  The extras are sadly substandard, but the series itself is excellent, and worth having in the digital format.",5,Checking in?,1092787200,"08 18, 2004",2004,5130,"['Come', 'visit', 'worst-run',

446632,A2BPDFR58H9575,6305076464,Galina,"[2, 2]","What a feast for all admirers of good comedy, English humor, British sitcoms, and John Cleese. God bless him and his wife at the time and collaborator Connie Booth for brilliant flawless writing of twelve (sadly, only twelve) 30 minutes episodes and to all cast for starring in the series that went on to become the top on the list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programs drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000. Having watched all twelve episodes during last weekend, I see very clearly where my favorite comedy of all times, A Fish Called Wanda swam from. Some episodes of Fawlty Towers are simply perfect or very close to being perfect. All twelve are always funny, crazy, hilarious and never ever for a second are boring or outdated despite been made over 30 years ago. Cleese is fabulous participating in almost every scene of the show and playing rude, cheap, obnoxious, and incompetent owner of the Seaside hotel in ""English Riviera"" which he manages along with domineering, and much more confident wife Sybil (Prunella Scales). With all these characteristics, Cleese manages to make Basil Fawlty somehow sympathetic in this never ending escalation of comical frustration. The point is - the show is absolutely hilarious without ever stooping to vulgarity or stupidity. It is a highest class entertainment and I am happy that I finally was able to enjoy all 12 episodes. The show was transferred beautifully to 3 DVD Set which IMO is one of the best sets I've had pleasure to experience. Each of three DVDs comes with the nice bonus features that include among many three parts interview with John Cleese who tells in great details about the origins of the show, its production, and how much fun it was for everyone involved. Cleese recalls visiting a hotel similar to Fawlty Towers during the filming of Monty Python  series.  The hotel manager whom Cleese describes as ""He was so rude, he was wonderful"" had become an inspiration for Basil Fawlty. The interview with Prunella Scales and Andrew Sacks who was as hilarious as Cleese playing Spanish waiter/porter Manuel (""You'll have to forgive him. He is from Barcelona"") with very limited command in English also add to the great feast that Fawlty Towers has been since its original showing in the 70s. The best episode, IMO is Communication Problems which is absolute perfection. It introduces us to the ""guest from hell"" in the body of Mrs. Richards, a very demanding lady with the hearing problems and the hearing aid that she would use quite selectively. Along with this guest, Basil Fawlty has to deal with the old passion for horses betting, the avenue of pleasure that is completely closed by his bossy wife Sybil. The result is the funniest and best acting episode of all - thanks to the regular players and late Joan Sanderson who almost stole the show as Mrs. Richards. The single most hilarious scene in all episodes definitely is the one in the episode ""Germans"" and it has to do with a talking moose head. I've returned to it several times while watching the episode and the scene always brought the tears from laughing too hard. To make the long story short - watch Fawlty Towers. It's got the top position on the list of 100 Best British TV programs for very good reasons and totally deserves it. It is one of the best and funniest sitcoms ever in the TV history.",5,"BasilFawlty:"" I think I'll have a lie down.

446648,A2B0XO8BTPRX7R,6305076464,Ian Vance,"[17, 22]","Comedy has always been a strange facet of human entertainment: a method in which the flaws of one's self - or the follies of mankind in general - are exposed and subsequently reduced by a knowing chuckle; the pain and suffering of miscommunication transformed into a cathartic moment of release.  Just as laughter is essential to the health and constitution, comedy can be an essential vehicle to gain insight into misfortune, to understand and perhaps overcome those same redundancies/patterns which plague the waking life.Turn on the boob-tube on any given ""prime-time"" night and the options for said release are near limitless: a thousand and one situational comedies vying for your attention (and commercial dollar, of course).  But are any really worth the time spent? Given the plethora of recycled motifs - unresolved sexual tension, slapstick excess, emotional estrangement, miscommunication in extremity - do any of these time-worn human-flaw laugh-triggers produce more than a hollow snicker? It really depends on the quality of the script and the dedication of the actors, the competency of the men behind the camera and the synergy of the crew as a whole to produce something fresh and uniquely expressive from human angst.  Few comedies, in my opinion, succeed in this regard: year after year, the bulk of Hollywood output is a case of diminishing returns.  But then again, Los Angeles is not quite the cultural center is pretends to be, now is it?In the late 1970's, John Cleese of Monty Python fame assembled a crack team of artists for an interesting variation on the situational comedy theme.  Based around the neurotic, perpetually grumpy hotel owner Basil Fawlty (played by Cleese), _Fawlty Towers_ is a heady blend of slapstick, misinterpretation and emotional overload, with impeccable timing and flat-out brilliant dialogue.  Comedy rarely gets better than this.The episodes:The Builders - Basil's ""need for the cheap"" comes on strong when the hotel needs repairs.  Naturally he goes for the lowest bidder for the job, behind his wife Sybil's back no less, with disastrous hijinks as a result.The Wedding Party - The Heat is in the air one summer night, and Basil, guardian of British upper-crust morals, seeks to put a lid on the brimming sexual tension run rampant in the hotel...only to get caught in several compromising positions himself.The Psychiatrist - When a psychiatrist comes to stay at Fawlty Towers, Basil goes out of his way to avoid the good doctor, subconsciously aware of his own unsteady sanity... all the while exposing his deepest anxieties and inconsistencies as he seeks to evict a (hilariously portrayed) debonair guest for ""loose conduct.""Hotel Inspectors - Basil Fawlty has a low tolerance for tourists of any kind.  After an extreme bout of rudeness to a pretentious guest, Basil bends over backwards trying to make amends with what he thinks is a hotel inspector...and, upon discovering his error, will do anything to enact revenge upon the poor individual.The Germans - After a slight concussion, Basil acts crazier than ever, and his unfortunate German guests must bear the brunt for some deep-seated post-war resentments.A Touch of Class - One of my favorites.  Basil Fawlty is the consummate snob, spitting poison at the `lower class' guests while fawning all over those with the slightest title and/or bearing.  But what happens when his snobbery is taken for a ride by a confidence trickster? Many laughs, I assure you...Gourmet Night - Fawlty Towers' first Gourmet Night seems to have everything going for it: a professional chef, the cream of Torque society, an eager Basil to genuflect and bootlick...yet events to not proceed as planned...Waldorf Salad - An obnoxious American guest stops by Fawlty Towers, receives an eyeful of Basil's inconsistent managing style, and proceeds to ""lay it on the line"" with the gangly Brit.The Kipper and the Corpse - a guest dies in his sleep and Basil runs himself (and the rest of the staff) ragged trying to conceal it from the other guests.  Probably the best tension-building episode of them all.Communication Problems - Mrs. Hinderson is deaf and doesn't use her hearing aide because `it runs the batteries down.'  She and Basil are like oil and water, with a flame about to touch down...The Anniversary - In his typical cruel fashion, Basil pretends to forget his anniversary with Sybil, all the while planning an elaborate surprise party.  But the joke is on him when Sybil stalks out and he must cater to his incoming guests...Basil the Rat - Hands down my favorite of them all.  Spanish waiter Manuel has a pet `Siberian Hamster' that sends Basil into conniption fits upon discovery.  With a Hotel Inspector having already put a black mark on Fawlty Towers, this particular pet must be stashed away before the hotel is closed down for good...and when the furry little fellow disappears, all chaos breaks out in consequence.If you are a fan of British humor in general and sophisticated comedies in particular, do yourself a favor: pick up this rare pinnacle of entertainment.

John Cleese runs a hotel, his wife abhors him and thinks he's a ninny, and the hired help for the hotel are hopelessly inept. A basis for most of us to be able to relate to Basil (who unfortunately actually is incompetent), the poor guy played by John Cleese, and that role is not quite as squeamish as John Lithgow is in 3rd Rock From The Sun, but along the same kind of humor. Prunella Scales is hilarious as an overbearing conceited British woman (the wife in the series), and the irreverent humor clashing in political incorrectness with German stereotypes who happen to be staying at the hotel is wonderful. Researching the hotel a bit by Googling ""Fawlty Towers"" gives you a marvelous insight on how this BBC TV series was based upon a real hotel, and the main character by John Cleese was inspired by a real person who was delightfully rude and boorish, as well as being a little bit nuts. The story's intentional complications and accidental misfires make this a very enjoyable farce about owning a hotel and trying to annoy people as much or more than they do you. I love this series, and first owned the series on VHS. Buy this DVD, you'll love it enough to want to keep watching and keep watching and keep watching until you've seen them all, and then start over again to see them over and over.

446673,A1SG5LXDO7TPY9,6305076464,John Robertson,"[0, 0]","I had to permanently donate my original DVD set of Flatery Owls to a friend who, incredibly, had never seen the series, despite her self-professed love for British comedy.  She had heard of Benny Hill, Dave Allen, On The Buses, Are You Being Served, etc.  In a sense, however, I could sort of understand why.  As other reviewers have said, this is a unique series, and due to it's painfully short 12-episode duration, is not aired in the same way as others.  Here in the US, for example, it's usually shown in sequence during a one-day PBS pledge-drive.  If that's not how she watched TV, then she might indeed miss it.  But the comedy style of insults, slapstick, wittiness, double-entendres, etc, are not quite like other British sitcoms, or Monty Python or anything really:  it's a style of comedy all its own.  The closest style I might compare it too is some of the best, live-action plays I've seen, although not too many people see plays these days.  But I think it's a mistake to try to deconstruct Fawlty Towers too much in order to see what makes it so funny, because I find it ruins the fun and spontaneity.  For me, this series is simply the benchmark for the very best comedy writing I have seen, and I can watch it every year and thoroughly enjoy it (which maybe speaks little for me).  I liked Fawlty Towers as a youngster and I still like it now, even though my taste in TV and writing has changed vastly over 30 years.The set has several interesting interviews from the principal actors included, and compared to many modern DVD's it might provide more extras in this way, although I found myself wanting a little more than what was included.  At the time, however, I had paid $64.99 USD, while as of today, the set currently sells for around $24.  The transfer is good -- it's not HDTV, but images are crisp and colors very good, as is the sound.  If you grew up watching this on analog TV or video cassettes, it's quite a step up.  Certain fashion styles aside, the series certainly does not look it's age.  Although it might be overkill, I am hoping BBC might still consider a 1080p version of the set one day.Other reviews thoroughly-describe the content and pretext of the episodes.  I will only add that, if by some chance you are one of those who haven't seen Fawlty Towers yet, and enjoy comedy to any degree, you really must see this.  It's been 35 years since the first 6 episodes were made, yet I still occasionally hear people I don't know quote lines from the show...usually insults...a testament to the lasting effect the show has upon those who've seen it.

Cleese is Basil Fawlty, the proprieter...a man whose distaste for his guests is barely disguised...and whose wife (Sybil, played by Prunella Scales) could win an award for nagging any day of the year.The humor, although resorting at times to blatant slapstick, can at times be as keen and witty as any you'll find anywhere. It's a pity so few of these shows were made.

""Are You Being Served?"", ""Man About The House"", and most notably ""Fawlty Towers.""As a big ""Monty Python"" fan, I was totally unprepared for the more sophisticated humor in ""Fawlty Towers"". John Cleese as Basil Fawlty, the proprietor of a somewhat dodgy inn, is as over the top in this series as he ever was. Fans of Cleese's contributions to Python won't be disappointed.Basil is rude, incompetent and extremely condescending. He consistently attempts to bully his patrons into following his own schedule, adapting to his own mannerisms and submitting to his will in general. Unfortunately for Basil, most of the patrons staying at the inn refuse to conform, and rightly so. The end result usually involves Basil being disgraced, humiliated and deflated.Basil's wife Sybil, played by Prunella Scales, is bossy, lazy and ineffective. Half of Sybil's life seems dedicated to barking orders to her husband, the other half to talking on the phone, chatting with customers or eating bon-bons.Polly, the maid/waitress, serves as Basil's partner in crime. When things go wrong, and they always do, it becomes Polly's job to help hide the evidence, usually from Sybil.Manuel is from Barcelona.Each episode of ""Fawlty Towers"" is truly a comedy of errors, the moral of which (if one needs a moral) might be: ""Don't be like Basil."" As things snowball out of control, Basil's and Polly's attempts to get a handle on the situation (usually while keeping everything from Sybil) result in some of the best comedic moments in television history.Each episode of the series is completely unique and may be watched separately; it doesn't take long to catch on to the characters and how they interact. Additionally, Cleese and Booth  put their unique stamp on the script, with lines just as quotable as anything from ""Monty Python"" or ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"".Because there are only 12 episodes total, the writing, the acting and the laughs stay top notch throughout. This isn't a collection one buys to get a couple of favorite episodes. The extras on the DVD mirror the series by being just right. Some commentary, some interviews, a couple of sidepieces, and that's it. No Hollywood flash, just things that will interest any fan of the series.One of the things I liked best about ""Fawlty Towers"" when watching it years ago, was that I could watch it with my Dad. The humor isn't universal. Some of it is dark, and most definitely a bit offbeat. Still, it's accessible enough that many people who don't care about the Spanish Inquisition, much less whether anyone expects it or not, will enjoy the train wreck that is Basil Fawlty.",5,"Timeless, Classic, Funnier Then Hell",1106092800,"01 19, 2005",2005,2752,"['teenager', 'became', 'hooked', 'local', 'PBS', 'station', 'large', 'part', 'due', 'number', 'BBC', 'produced', 'sitcoms', 'would', 'show', 'Are', 'Being', 'Served', 'Man', 'House', 'most', 'notably', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'big', 'Monty', 'Python', 'fan', 'was', 'totally', 'unprepared', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'humor', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'John', 'Cleese', 'Basil', 'Fawlty', 'proprietor', 'somewhat', 'dodgy', 'inn', 'top', 'series', 'ever', 'was', 'Fans', 'Cleese', 'contributions', 'Python', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.Basil', 'rude', 'incompetent', 'extremely', 'condescending', 'consistently', 'bully', 'patrons', 'following', 'own', 'schedule', 'adapting', 'own', 'mannerisms', 'submitting', 'will', 'general', 'Unfortunately', 'Basil', 'most', 'patrons', 'staying', 'inn', 'refuse', 'conform', 'rightly', 'so', 'end', 'result', 'usually', 'Basil', 'being', 'disgraced', 'humiliated', 'wife', 'Sybil', 'played', 'Prunella', 'Scales', 'bossy', 'lazy', 'ineffective', 'Half', 'Sybil', 'life', 'dedicated', 'barking', 'orders', 'husband', 'other', 'half', 'talking', 'phone', 'chatting', 'customers', 'eating', 'bon-bons.Polly', 'maid/waitress', 'Basil', 'partner', 'crime', 'When', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'always', 'do', 'Polly', 'job', 'help', 'hide', 'evidence', 'usually', 'Sybil.Manuel', 'Barcelona.Each', 'episode', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'truly', 'comedy', 'errors', 'moral', 'one', 'moral', 'might', 'be', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'Basil', 'things', 'snowball', 'control', 'Basil', 'Polly', 'attempts', 'get', 'handle', 'situation', 'usually', 'keeping', 'everything', 'Sybil', 'result', 'best', 'comedic', 'moments', 'television', 'history.Each', 'episode', 'series', 'completely', 'unique', 'may', 'be', 'watched', 'separately', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'catch', 'characters', 'how', 'interact', 'Additionally', 'Cleese', 'Booth', 'put', 'unique', 'stamp', 'script', 'lines', 'just', 'as', 'quotable', 'anything', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'Galaxy', '.Because', 'are', 'only', '12', 'episodes', 'total', 'writing', 'acting', 'laughs', 'stay', 'top', 'notch', ""n't"", 'collection', 'one', 'buys', 'get', 'couple', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'extras', 'DVD', 'mirror', 'series', 'being', 'just', 'right', 'commentary', 'interviews', 'couple', 'sidepieces', 'Hollywood', 'flash', 'just', 'things', 'will', 'interest', 'fan', 'series.One', 'things', 'liked', 'best', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'when', 'watching', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'could', 'watch', 'Dad', 'humor', ""n't"", 'universal', 'dark', 'most', 'definitely', 'bit', 'offbeat', 'Still', 'accessible', 'enough', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Spanish', 'Inquisition', 'much', 'less', 'anyone', 'not', 'will', 'enjoy', 'train', 'wreck', 'Basil', 'Fawlty']",N/A

Now, some come VERY close (Monty Python, The Young Ones), but this towers above all else...so much lunacy and originality in one short, tidy, compact little package.  I used to have the first set, which I had bought based on hearsay, people mentioning that ""Fawlty Towers"" is the ""Sistine Chapel Of Sitcoms"" for instance...and I agreed...I laughed so hard I almost bust a gut...but I had to sell a lot of things to acquire some needed cash, and haven't seen this show in quite a while.  I remembered how much of a joy it was to watch, and always loved John Cleese's work, both comedic and dramatic, like on the Harry Potter movies.Well, to my delight and surprise, I came upon this newer & improved set at the library...promptly took it out, and was delighted and reminded how superb this show is, top to bottom...from the writing (amazing and movie-worthy), to the acting, attention to detail, and the utter bravery to stick to the original vision and just ""go for it"", no matter the situation, as silly and perverse as they may be.  These episodes (and whole series really) is like a favourite album by your fave band...it always gives and gives, it's an utter delight, reveals new details with each sitting...and it's only 12 episodes, so each one is like a fave song...and you can always go back to it and watch each one over and over without getting sick of it.This series is better than most US sitcoms because it just goes for it into wacky lunacy, physical slapstick (surprised no one got seriously hurt!!) & classic British farce, without losing the sense of dialogue or plot.  The writing (mostly by stars John Cleese and then-wife Connie Booth...who plays the utterly sane straight-woman maid/waitress Polly) is brilliant and timeless...this stuff just does NOT get old!!  The characters are iconic...Cleese who plays the exasperated and totally RUDE Basil Fawlty, Prunella Scales who plays his too-serious wife Sybil...Connie Booth as Polly and, oh gosh, Andrew Sachs as the English-impaired, waiter-in-training from Barcelona, Manuel...what a fun bunch!!This set is so fun, and the special features as good as the episodes...it's great that Cleese looks back on this series with affection, not negativity...this series clearly has a place in his heart, as it should...this show was as good as comedy gets, and even moreso...this thing should set the standard and I think it has...its rep is only growing plus it seems to get new fans every week, which is why ""Fawlty Towers"" never goes out of style.  Now, I read that Bob Newhart's show ""Newhart"" was an American show based on ""Fawlty Towers""...but the only similarity is that both are based out of a hotel & its staff...I canNOT see how ""Newhart"" is as funny as ""Fawlty Towers"", no way no HOW...nothing against the funny Bob Newhart though.PS...Also, I LOVE the fun details on the show too, like the misspelled signs, hahaha...bring on the riff raff!!",5,"So funny, you'll bust a gut...so be warned!!

John Cleese's situation comedy only ran for two seasons for a total of 12 episodes, but it is clear that the Monty Python alumnus crafted these shows with a special care.The result is a series that gets funnier as it progresses.  Cleese is ""Basil Fawlty"" our (anti-)hero, the misanthropic owner/manager of the hotel referred to in the title.  The episodes demonstrate his frentic attempts at either trying to increase the social standing of his establishment, or alternatively, just keep it running.  In these attempts, he confronts many formidable and/or obnoxious characters (the best of which would come down to either his own wife or the hard-of-hearing Mrs. Richards).  Too cowardly to confront these characters, Basil channels his frustrations to the innocent or harmless...usually his own incompetent bellboy.What really distinguishes this series is the timing and editing.  There are websites devoted to the structure of these programs and how the plot develops.  Watching any episode, you can feel the tension building as Basil's latest crisis escalates beyond his abilities.  By the tme you get to the final minutes, you are laughing as a release as much as a reaction to the antics.It's not perfect--some characters never really click (the Major), and its not a very polished production (some lines are inaudible).  All in all though this is one of the few television series worth owning.

I searched and searched and then I found out that this is all there is.  There ain't no more folks.  Fawlty Towers is funny for more than one reason.  Generally, British sitcoms are not as rigid as American sitcoms.  Then there is the language itself.  Pronounciations and accents make things sound even funnier.  I would imagine that you've never called your wife a ""stupid cloth eared beet"" before.  John Cleese is simply mad.  He's very tall and the sight of him doing his slapstick physical comedy is hilarious.You can usually see Fawlty Towers and all the other ""Britcoms"" on PBS but they go through periods where they remove certain shows from the air from time to time.  You may remember John Cleese from his younger days with Monty Python's Flying Circus, which I didn't watch for years because I thought it was a circus show.  What a fool was I.Here are some of my favorites that you simply must see:The Corpse and the Kipper - A guest dies during the night but when Basil Fawlty brings his breafast in the morning he doesn't even notice the guy is dead!The Health Inspector - The Health Inspector comes to perform a suprise inspection.  Little does Basil know that Manuel has a pet rat that gets loose in the hotel.  Manuel thinks it's a hamster.  Everyone tries to catch the rat while keeping it hush-hush from the inspector.  This episode is wild.The Germans - Basil Fawlty's done himself a mischief and gotten a concusion.  He leaves the hospital insisting that he's okay because the Germans are coming and he must be there.  Add that to the fact that he can't speak German and watch the fun.Gourmet Night - Basil tries to cater to the upper crust of British Society by offering a Gourmet Night at the hotel.  It doesn't go well.  The chef (a male) gets drunk and falls in love with Manuel.  There's no dinner to serve and Basil orders it from another restaurant.  He has to pick it up but he gets stuck because the car that he tried to fix himself stops running.  He threatens the car but when that doesn't work, he decides to beat the car with a switch!  When he finally gets back his dinner is not quite what he expected.The Anniversary - Basil and his wife have a bit of a row (fight) and she leaves just when he's all set to suprise her with a party.  He decides to have the maid pretend that she is his wife.  I can't even explain the rest.  It's too nuts!You must get this DVD especially if you love Britcoms.

Bottom line is that, in my opinion, this ranks up there with the funniest TV shows of all-time.Here's an example: in the crabby deaf old lady (Mrs. Richards) episode, Basil has been betting on the horses, just to try and win some of his own money, and to try to squeeze out from under the iron thumb of wife Sibyl. Of course, the domineering Sibyl vehemently disapproves of Basil doing just about anything on his own. She has suspicions, and cooly says, ""Basil, you know what I'm going to do if I find out you've been betting on the horses, don't you?"" Basil shakes his head and does his best to appear studious, then mutters under his breath, out of her earshot, ""You'll have to sew 'em back on first!""That is, his testicles! No American show would have been witty or daring enough to get that line in, forty years ago.Same episode: Mrs. Richards and Basil in her hotel room, and she's complaining about the view.

When it finally does come out, it is a complete disappointment, as usual.Once again, BBC has overcompressed the show you care about so they can include a partially filled disc of Extras that no one cares about.The set has ""Remastered"" plastered across the front, and on the startup menu of each of the shows.

I think I might have gotten better quality that way, even though, per the BBC long-standing policy of assuring that classics are preserved for posterity in the shoddiest possible manner, they are recorded at four-hour format instead of two-hour like they should have been.All twelve episodes are crammed onto two DVDs, assuring the lowest possible video quality and the maximum possible degredation.As if that weren't enough, they make you sit through a full five minutes of FBI warnings and ads for other BBC products before you can even get to the main menu!  Hit the Stop button at any point in this process, and then the Menu button just takes you back to the beginning of the FBI warning, and you have to sit through the whole five minutes again!Once you finally do make it to the main menu, Prunella Scales is shouting something at four times the volume of the entire rest of the disk!I do have to admit that the extras are better than usual.  The interviews are actually interesting.  The outtakes are better than just people blowing their lines, which is all they typically consist of.  But there are only four of them.

Caught lots more than I did in the past, probably due to increased life experience pointing up the principles involved in most work environments. Unless one is put off/confused by the series's Britishisms, this will function as classic comedy descended from the likes of The Honeymooners, Laurel & Hardy, & even Wodehouse. It's some of the funniest stuff I've ever seen, with something for everyone but anyone who might be offended by the treatment of the Manuel character, but hilarity tends to override such concerns.

To this day, Fawlty Towers remains my favorite Britcom, and possibly even my favorite sitcom of all time.  It has become the standard by which all other Britcoms are measured and judged.  Star/co-creator John Cleese is at his comic best as Basil Fawlty, the snobby, obnoxious proprietor of Fawlty Towers, a small hotel in Torquay, which Basil runs with his wife Sybil.  Prunella Scales matches Cleese's brilliance as she plays Sybil.  Connie Booth, Cleese's then-wife, was a co-creator of the series and also played Polly, the maid.  And then we have Andrew Sachs as the Spanish bellboy Manuel (""He's from Barcelona."").  His comic clashes with Basil are priceless.  My overall favorite episode is Communication Problems, with Mrs. Richards, the guest who refuses to turn on her hearing aid so as not to run the battery down.  Other noteworthy episodes include Waldorf Salad, The Germans, Basil the Rat and The Kipper and the Corpse.

446744,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,6305076464,Robert Badgley,"[4, 4]","There is indeed nothing faulty with Fawlty Towers.This Britcom which was first filmed in 1975 then added to later in 1979 is an enduring classic of its genre and is definitely one of the all time best....period.It's star John Cleese along with then-wife and co-star(Polly)Connie Booth collaborated on the entire series together.Most of the series was filmed in studio but there were quite a few exterior shots and they used the Wooburn Grange Country Club in Torquay,England for that purpose.The club itself has since burned down and been bulldozed to make way for residential development.However Cleeses' actual inspiration for the character of Basil Fawlty comes from one Mr.Sinclair(now deceased) the o/o of the GlenEagles Hotel in Torquay.It seems Cleese and some of the Monty Python cast and crew were staying at the GlenEagles and experienced some of Mr.Sinclair's,shall we say,""inestimable charm"" first hand.Most of the group was not amused and off most trotted to a nearby and more forgiving establishment for the duration of their stay there.Cleese however was intrigued by the utter gall,bluster and plain rudeness of Mr.Sinclair and thought he would stay to observe this local phenom up close and personal.From that experience sprang forth the idea for Basil Fawlty and the rest is sitcom history.Fawlty Towers has created a minor tourism point of call for the GlenEagles Hotel in Torquay and the surrounding area .Buses and folks from all over the world come there to have a glimpse of the famous hotel which inspried this wonderful show.Depending on who one talks to the oppinions of locals range from happy to embarassed but very rarely negative.And this is quite a testament to just a 12 episode Britcom which during its' first airing in 1975 didn't get much attention at all.It wasn't until its' re-runs the following years that the groundswell gathered steam which eventually prompted more eps to be filmed in 1979.When you look at them today it is almost nigh impossible to tell where the /75-ers start and the /79-ers end.Again another indication of the over all quality of the show from top to bottom.Technically speaking this show has been transferred very well from tape.The contrast and colours have been cleaned up and it looks better than it ever did.The three discs included with this set(not four as indicated above by one of the product reviewers)comes with interviews with Cleese,Sachs(Manuel) and Scales(Mrs.Fawlty),trips to Torquay,out takes,directors commentaries and more.The reason I'm not giving this higher stars is because of the lack of any inserts with episode information.There is an extremely lean blurb for each ep on the back cover of the set but that's it.One assumes also that the eps listed are in order but it would have been nice to have at least release dates but sadly there are none.I think for the price BBC video could have plumped this set up a bit.In conclusion except for the minor drawbacks listed this set generally is worth getting for any fan of good comedy sitcoms and /or Britcoms.It's humour and characters are universally indentifiable and work on many levels.It is still fast paced(in large part due to its' judicious editing) and plain laugh out loud funny.A real ""inn-keeper""!!",4,Fawlty Towers-a real Inn-Keeper!,1183766400,"07 7,

446745,A16QODENBJVUI1,6305076464,Robert Moore,"[4, 5]","I would like to state a bit of a paradox:  while I believe MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS to be the greatest television comedy series in the history the medium, I believe FAWLTY TOWERS is the funniest.  With the former, much of the delight is the sheer intellectual or conceptual brilliance of the skits.  There is relatively little that is conceptual or intellectual about FAWLTY TOWERS:  it is a classic situational farce done as perfectly as is possible.  There is none of the self-reflective genius of Monty Python, in with the boys made fun of history, politics, society, the BBC, and the television medium itself.  Instead, we get the most absurdly funny character in the history of TV, one Mr. Basil Fawlty.Of the members of Monty Python, several of the members were verbally brilliant.  Actually, any of the group was capable of saying something utterly off the wall and brilliant.  But John Cleese was the only member of the group who was a truly great physical comedian.  He was the only one who could have performed the Silly Walk.  His greatness as a physical comedian was never greater than in the two FAWLTY TOWERS series.  His disjointed, gangly contortions are perhaps the funniest this side of the double jointed Jim Carrey, and his verbal ripostes are even better than his physical comedy.The cast as a whole is brilliant.  Prunella Scales as Sybil, acutely aware of Basil's absurdities while blithefully ignorant of her own, is the perfect ballast to Cleese's Basil.  Andrew Sachs is always delightful as the linguistically challenged Manuel (""Don't mind him, he's from Barcelona"").  American Connie Booth, co-writer of the series and married to Cleese for most of the series, was solid as Polly, sort of the ""straight man"" in the cast.Besides the actors, the key to the series is the utterly brilliant scripts.  In a way, it is a miracle that there were 12 episodes.  Each show was packed with so many bits of verbal brilliance and brilliant conceived guest characters that it would have been impossible to sustain them beyond that number of episodes.I will defend to my dying day MONTY PYTHON as the greatest TV comedy, but as much as I adore it, I have never, ever laughed as hard at anything on TV as at FAWLTY TOWERS.",5,As funny a TV show as has ever been seen,1035331200,"10 23, 2002",2002,2239,"['would', 'like', 'state', 'bit', 'paradox', 'believe', 'MONTY', 'PYTHON', 'FLYING', 'CIRCUS', 'be', 'greatest', 'television', 'comedy', 'series', 'history', 'medium', 'believe', 'FAWLTY', 'TOWERS', 'funniest', 'former', 'much', 'delight', 'sheer', 'intellectual', 'conceptual', 'brilliance', 'skits', 'relatively', 'little', 'conceptual', 'intellectual', 'FAWLTY', 'TOWERS', 'classic', 'situational', 'farce', 'done', 'as', 'perfectly', 'possible', 'none', 'self-reflective', 'genius', 'Monty', 'Python', 'boys', 'made', 'fun', 'history', 'politics', 'society', 'BBC', 'television', 'medium', 'Instead', 'get', 'most', 'absurdly', 'funny', 'character', 'history', 'TV', 'one', 'Mr', 'Basil', 'Fawlty.Of', 'members', 'Monty', 'Python', 'several', 'members', 'were', 'verbally', 'brilliant', 'Actually', 'group', 'was', 'capable', 'saying', 'something', 'utterly', 'wall', 'brilliant', 'John', 'Cleese', 'was', 'only', 'member', 'group', 'who', 'was', 'truly', 'great', 'physical', 'comedian', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'performed', 'Silly', 'Walk', 'greatness', 'physical', 'comedian', 'was', 'never', 'greater', 'two', 'FAWLTY', 'TOWERS', 'series', 'disjointed', 'gangly', 'contortions', 'are', 'perhaps', 'funniest', 'side', 'double', 'jointed', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'verbal', 'ripostes', 'are', 'even', 'better', 'physical', 'comedy.The', 'cast', 'whole', 'brilliant', 'Prunella', 'Scales', 'Sybil', 'acutely', 'aware', 'Basil', 'absurdities', 'blithefully', 'ignorant', 'own', 'perfect', 'ballast', 'Cleese', 'Basil', 'Andrew', 'Sachs', 'always', 'delightful', 'linguistically', 'challenged', 'Manuel', 'Do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'Barcelona', 'American', 'Connie', 'Booth', 'co-writer', 'series', 'married', 'Cleese', 'most', 'series', 'was', 'solid', 'Polly', 'sort', 'straight', 'man', 'cast.Besides', 'actors', 'key', 'series', 'utterly', 'brilliant', 'scripts', 'way', 'miracle', 'were', '12', 'episodes', 'show', 'was', 'packed', 'so', 'many', 'bits', 'verbal', 'brilliance', 'brilliant', 'conceived', 'guest', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'impossible', 'sustain', 'number', 'episodes.I', 'will', 'defend', 'dying', 'day', 'MONTY', 'PYTHON', 'greatest', 'TV', 'comedy', 'as', 'much', 'adore', 'have', 'never', 'ever', 'laughed', 'hard', 'anything', 'TV', 'FAWLTY', 'TOWERS']",N/A

After a day or so, the other Pythons checked out, but Cleese and Booth remained.  The others left for a nearby hotel, disgusted with the abusive behavior of the proprietor, one Major Sinclaire. Cleese -- as one might expect -- was fascinated and entertained by the rude and boorish attitude of Sinclaire.  ""He was awful.  And just wonderful,"" Cleese said in a recent interview.When Cleese had an opportunity to create a new show for the BBC, he and Booth developed ""FAWLTY TOWERS"" (Warner Bros, ...).  When the pilot was submitted, it was met with resistance by top BBC execs, one of whom wrote a famous memo that said the concept and script was ""cliched, unfunny and claustrophobic.""The premise is essentially about Basil Fawlty, a tightly wound guy who runs a hotel.  And all would be perfect in his world if he didn't have to put up with staff, including his  shrill but competent wife Sybil (Prunella Scales) and guests.In 1975 ""Fawlty Towers"" slowly caught the attention of a core audience with only six episodes.  Reruns in the UK and on PBS really caught on.  In 1979 another six episodes aired and were a huge success.  Over time, a hard core audience has steadily grown around the world.  For the first time, all 12 episodes are available, digitally remastered, on a three disc set. An extended, funny and sometimes personal interview with Cleese on each disc is a wonderful primer on his take of why this series works and is more popular than ever. He reflects on the origins of the material and his memories of his stay at the Gleneagles Hotel and the late, infamous, Major Sinclaire; he talks about using taboo subjects that make an audience uneasy and thus more vulnerable to laughter; explains the meticulous attention to the writing process -- each episode on one idea with two and a half weeks on the plot and six weeks for the dialogue; he observes why it's funny when characters like Basil are forced to behave in a way the audience knows is not an honest and authentic feeling of that character at a specific moment of stress.  And he talks about this being a comedy of emotions as opposed to a comedy of ideas (""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"").  There are also interviews with Prunella Scales and Andrew Sachs who plays the hapless Manuel (""Que?"").  Sadly, cowriter and costar Connie Booth is nowhere to be found in the special features.  There's a startling and strangely emotional two minute video tour, with an operatic aria on the sound track, of the burned out Wooburn Grange Country Club that served as the exterior for Fawlty Towers.But best of all are the 12 masterful episodes of outrageous faux pas, crazed desperation, manic dottiness and absurd gyrations.  See again or for the first time ""A Touch of Class,"" ""The Builders,""  ""The Wedding party,""  ""The Germans,"" ""The Psychiatrist,"" The Kipper and the Corpse"" and the rest.  They are the creme de la creme of sitcoms and arguably the best sustained six hours of farce in the English language.Beware of the commentary track by director John Davies on disc two.  If it's not a sad accident of a swallowed mini mic, it is an hysterical put on.",5,MAKE THAT 10 STARS ON A SCALE OF 5,1006128000,"11 19, 2001",2001,3278,"['early', '70s', 'touring', 'fellow', 'Pythons', 'John', 'Cleese', 'then', 'wife', 'Connie', 'Booth', 'stayed', 'Gleneagles', 'Hotel', 'Torquay', 'Devon', 'England', 'day', 'so', 'other', 'Pythons', 'checked', 'out', 'Cleese', 'Booth', 'remained', 'others', 'left', 'nearby', 'hotel', 'disgusted', 'abusive', 'behavior', 'proprietor', 'one', 'Major', 'Sinclaire', 'Cleese', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'was', 'fascinated', 'entertained', 'rude', 'boorish', 'attitude', 'Sinclaire', 'was', 'awful', 'just', 'wonderful', 'Cleese', 'said', 'recent', 'interview.When', 'Cleese', 'had', 'opportunity', 'create', 'new', 'show', 'BBC', 'Booth', 'developed', 'FAWLTY', 'TOWERS', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'When', 'pilot', 'was', 'submitted', 'was', 'met', 'resistance', 'top', 'BBC', 'execs', 'one', 'whom', 'wrote', 'famous', 'memo', 'said', 'concept', 'script', 'was', 'cliched', 'unfunny', 'claustrophobic', 'premise', 'essentially', 'Basil', 'Fawlty', 'tightly', 'wound', 'guy', 'who', 'hotel', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'world', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'put', 'up', 'staff', 'including', 'shrill', 'competent', 'wife', 'Sybil', 'Prunella', 'Scales', 'guests.In', '1975', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'slowly', 'caught', 'attention', 'core', 'audience', 'only', 'six', 'episodes', 'Reruns', 'UK', 'PBS', 'really', 'caught', '1979', 'six', 'episodes', 'aired', 'were', 'huge', 'success', 'time', 'hard', 'core', 'audience', 'steadily', 'grown', 'world', 'first', 'time', '12', 'episodes', 'are', 'available', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'three', 'disc', 'set', 'extended', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'personal', 'interview', 'Cleese', 'disc', 'wonderful', 'primer', 'take', 'why', 'series', 'more', 'popular', 'ever', 'origins', 'material', 'memories', 'stay', 'Gleneagles', 'Hotel', 'late', 'infamous', 'Major', 'Sinclaire', 'using', 'taboo', 'subjects', 'make', 'audience', 'uneasy', 'thus', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'laughter', 'meticulous', 'attention', 'writing', 'process', 'episode', 'one', 'idea', 'two', 'half', 'weeks', 'plot', 'six', 'weeks', 'dialogue', 'why', 'funny', 'when', 'characters', 'Basil', 'are', 'forced', 'behave', 'way', 'audience', 'not', 'honest', 'authentic', 'feeling', 'character', 'specific', 'moment', 'stress', 'being', 'comedy', 'emotions', 'opposed', 'comedy', 'ideas', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'are', 'also', 'interviews', 'Prunella', 'Scales', 'Andrew', 'Sachs', 'who', 'hapless', 'Manuel', 'Que', 'Sadly', 'cowriter', 'costar', 'Connie', 'Booth', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'special', 'features', 'startling', 'strangely', 'emotional', 'two', 'minute', 'video', 'tour', 'operatic', 'aria', 'sound', 'track', 'burned', 'out', 'Wooburn', 'Grange', 'Country', 'Club', 'served', 'exterior', 'Fawlty', 'Towers.But', 'best', 'are', '12', 'masterful', 'episodes', 'outrageous', 'faux', 'pas', 'crazed', 'desperation', 'manic', 'dottiness', 'absurd', 'gyrations', 'See', 'again', 'first', 'time', 'Touch', 'Class', 'Builders', 'Wedding', 'party', 'Germans', 'Psychiatrist', 'Kipper', 'Corpse', 'rest', 'are', 'creme', 'la', 'creme', 'sitcoms', 'arguably', 'best', 'sustained', 'six', 'hours', 'farce', 'English', 'language.Beware', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'John', 'Davies', 'disc', 'two', 'not', 'sad', 'accident', 'swallowed', 'mini', 'mic', 'hysterical', 'put']",N/A

446760,A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z,6305076464,"Santeria ""Son of Tazz""","[12, 18]","The real prize element of this collection is that it shows Cleese's side of the MONTY PYTHON team, as well as being a great show piece for  Connie Booth's writing skills. It is very evident that this body of work is culturally specific in it's overall sense of humour: Whilst it is clear that US audiences enjoy the series( and some most definitely do not), the things that are liked are different to the way a British audience will perceive the series.There are three  seasons in this collection, not the two as usually stated. Three seasons, three discs...The writing is incredibly precise. You can see this in the published versions of the scripts. In this respect, it has the same skilled basis for good performers as the Python Material. But where the Python team did not know where to stop, Cleese and Booth decided to leave it at three seasons, and so whilst there is a demand there for more of this material, Cleese and Booth wanted to leave on a high note.It's incredibly hard to give a precise of each show, since the writers blocked out the story flows on charts over 6 week  periods, and basically agonized  over every word. These shows were done with an eye for precision, and in this respect they were an extension of the Python  process for writing, since each show ( FAWLTY TOWERS as well as seasons 1-3 of MONTY PYTHON) is an example of detailed work.All this adds up to a body of work that stands up to repeated viewing, and has a degree of universality ( like YES MINISTER, and  YES  PRIME MINISTER, but the YES... MINISTER  series are much more  Universal). And I suspect that the writers and producers never expected this series to have the longevity it has attained ( Much the same way that Ben Elton has stated that THE YOUNG ONES is very clearly  dated, since it was targeted for specific  times and specific  events); however, FAWLTY TOWERS looks at some Universal  elements in life, and in  British  experience.Undoubtedly, FAWLTY TOWERS is perennial, but it is mainly perennial for the British  experience; a US  audience will like it to some degree, but the appeal is fundamentally  different. It is not that it is less, just different.All that Being said, I can recommend this collection as being a great body of work. As an example of low budget British TV comedy that has at its heart a Superb script, one can but hope that TV in general, in all places, irrespective of the budget, will look to great scripts, and let the story telling be augmented by great performers ( such as Cleese), each to their own milieu ( Cultural, or whatever), or even if aimed at a world audience. Key to the understanding of the cultural  specificity, is how Manuel changes from being Spanish in the original  series, and then in the Spanish, he is Italian, and in each different language dub, the Archetype selected for Manuel changes  according to how each dub version will select a different nationality to be the butt of the jokes... and the way these jokes are translated tell more about the culture they are being reworked into than they do about the original  version of the show.At once a very simple show, but it can be seen on many levels; however, if you don't get it, if you don't find the shows funny, remember that these ARE shows done for a particular Milieu; a better example of more Universal comedy from the BBC, is something like YES MINISTER ( not to say that this higher budget work is better, simply different).",5,"Excellent Comedy, Great Material",1109116800,"02 23, 2005",2005,3444,"['real', 'prize', 'element', 'collection', 'Cleese', 'side', 'MONTY', 'PYTHON', 'team', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'great', 'show', 'piece', 'Connie', 'Booth', 'writing', 'skills', 'very', 'evident', 'body', 'work', 'culturally', 'specific', 'overall', 'sense', 'humour', 'Whilst', 'clear', 'US', 'audiences', 'enjoy', 'series', 'most', 'definitely', 'do', 'not', 'things', 'are', 'liked', 'are', 'different', 'way', 'British', 'audience', 'will', 'perceive', 'series.There', 'are', 'three', 'seasons', 'collection', 'not', 'two', 'usually', 'stated', 'Three', 'seasons', 'three', 'discs', 'writing', 'incredibly', 'precise', 'can', 'see', 'published', 'versions', 'scripts', 'respect', 'same', 'skilled', 'basis', 'good', 'performers', 'Python', 'Material', 'where', 'Python', 'team', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'where', 'stop', 'Cleese', 'Booth', 'decided', 'leave', 'three', 'seasons', 'so', 'whilst', 'demand', 'there', 'more', 'material', 'Cleese', 'Booth', 'wanted', 'leave', 'high', 'note.It', 'incredibly', 'hard', 'give', 'precise', 'show', 'writers', 'blocked', 'out', 'story', 'charts', '6', 'week', 'periods', 'basically', 'agonized', 'over', 'word', 'shows', 'were', 'done', 'eye', 'precision', 'respect', 'were', 'extension', 'Python', 'process', 'writing', 'show', 'FAWLTY', 'TOWERS', 'as', 'well', 'seasons', '1-3', 'MONTY', 'PYTHON', 'example', 'detailed', 'work.All', 'up', 'body', 'work', 'up', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'degree', 'universality', 'YES', 'MINISTER', 'YES', 'PRIME', 'MINISTER', 'YES', 'MINISTER', 'series', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'Universal', 'suspect', 'writers', 'producers', 'never', 'expected', 'series', 'have', 'longevity', 'attained', 'Much', 'same', 'way', 'Ben', 'Elton', 'stated', 'THE', 'YOUNG', 'ONES', 'very', 'clearly', 'dated', 'was', 'targeted', 'specific', 'times', 'specific', 'events', 'however', 'FAWLTY', 'TOWERS', 'Universal', 'elements', 'life', 'British', 'experience.Undoubtedly', 'FAWLTY', 'TOWERS', 'perennial', 'mainly', 'perennial', 'British', 'experience', 'US', 'audience', 'will', 'like', 'degree', 'appeal', 'fundamentally', 'different', 'not', 'less', 'just', 'different.All', 'Being', 'said', 'can', 'recommend', 'collection', 'being', 'great', 'body', 'work', 'example', 'low', 'budget', 'British', 'TV', 'comedy', 'heart', 'Superb', 'script', 'one', 'can', 'hope', 'TV', 'general', 'places', 'irrespective', 'budget', 'will', 'look', 'great', 'scripts', 'let', 'story', 'telling', 'be', 'augmented', 'great', 'performers', 'such', 'Cleese', 'own', 'milieu', 'Cultural', 'even', 'aimed', 'world', 'audience', 'Key', 'understanding', 'cultural', 'specificity', 'how', 'Manuel', 'changes', 'being', 'Spanish', 'original', 'series', 'then', 'Spanish', 'Italian', 'different', 'language', 'dub', 'Archetype', 'selected', 'Manuel', 'changes', 'according', 'how', 'dub', 'version', 'will', 'select', 'different', 'nationality', 'be', 'butt', 'jokes', 'way', 'jokes', 'are', 'translated', 'tell', 'more', 'culture', 'are', 'being', 'reworked', 'do', 'original', 'version', 'show.At', 'once', 'very', 'simple', 'show', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'many', 'levels', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'shows', 'funny', 'remember', 'ARE', 'done', 'particular', 'Milieu', 'better', 'example', 'more', 'Universal', 'comedy', 'BBC', 'something', 'YES', 'MINISTER', 'not', 'say', 'higher', 'budget', 'work', 'better', 'simply', 'different']",N/A

446771,AY1VKH4KEL0TB,6305076464,S. Sokoll,"[0, 0]","Fawlty Towers is still the funniest series ever produced.  The cast was perfect, the scripts crisp, action-packed and hilarious, and the situations were totally believable. John Cleese is a master of physical and verbal comedy, with the remarkable goose-step, the thrashing of the mini, the manhandling of Manuel, the spasmodic jerks and jumps - one can go on and on.  The rest of the cast is perfect and fantastics, but Cleese is the pivotal character in the mix.  His unctious, obsequiousness to those perceived to be in the upper class and drop-dead rudeness to everyone else is one of key elements of action at Fawlty Towers.There was an attempt to translate the series to the US in a version starring Diana Rigg.  This series followed in the steps of several other British series with less than likeable main characters coming to the US with great success (Sanford & Son, All in the Family).  The series lasted through several episodes which were straight re-writes of the original.  The move from male to female lead did not work, and the emphasis on class differences necessary to the British version did not play in the States.I am not going to list the episodes or heap masses of praise - others have done that.  I am going to tell you about my favorite episode - the Anniversary Party - where the normally obnoxious Basil tries to plan a surprise party for his wife, gets her so mad at him by pretending to have forgotten the event that she leaves, forcing him to resort to a small lie to placate the arriving guests.  This lie balloons with each arrival, until Basil is forced to hire Polly, the maid, to impersonate his wife.  In this episode you actually wind up feeling sorry for Basil, who, though hoist by his own petard, is doing what he thinks is best for good reasons with very bad results.The episodes in this series are so tightly written that several of them actually seem like two separate episodes in terms of action (the concussion/fire alarm is a prime example).This series is the best ever made.  It can be watched again and again and again.

If not, what rock have you been under?  I saw this series first on American PBS in 1982 and was struck by the brilliant writing, physical acting and clever dynamic of the cast.  At the time America only turned out sitcoms filled with dull jokes, tepid characters, heavily inflated laugh tracks, or the Fonz striking poses as the crowd wailed mercilessly in rapture.  Stale.  Amazingly, classmates of mine in high school at the time claimed it was boring and couldn't understand the plots.  And they were never heard of again.This 70's BBC series is classic, and a must have for any comedy lover.  Dated, but it has its place.  Much of the writing and comedic action is still leaps ahead of modern fare, despite being one of the cheapest series produced at the time by the BBC (in 1974).Shows are uncut and unadulterated.  No special correction or computer fixes to small imperfections.  Thank god.  It is a very classy and straight forward package.  Mr. Davies and Mr. Spiers provide commentary tracks which are nearly to sleep by.  Davies is mostly quiet, and his gurgling stomach is constantly providing commentary while Spiers is heard endlessly drinking, smoking or exercising Restless Leg Syndrome.  And it sounds like it was shot in someone's spare bedroom.  Still good for a one time listen by fans of the series, but not worth it if you just like the shows and don't care about where cameras were position, or how long make up took.",5,"The Rat that wasn't supposed to be, a dead guest, and Germans(don't mention the war!)",1168128000,"01 7, 2007",2007,1568,"['Anyone', 'looking', 'DVD', 'set', '12', 'episodes', 'most', 'likely', 'series', 'seen', 'part', 'somewhere', 'else', 'not', 'what', 'rock', 'have', 'been', 'saw', 'series', 'first', 'American', 'PBS', '1982', 'was', 'struck', 'brilliant', 'writing', 'physical', 'acting', 'clever', 'dynamic', 'cast', 'time', 'America', 'only', 'turned', 'out', 'sitcoms', 'filled', 'dull', 'jokes', 'tepid', 'characters', 'heavily', 'inflated', 'laugh', 'tracks', 'Fonz', 'striking', 'poses', 'crowd', 'wailed', 'mercilessly', 'rapture', 'Stale', 'Amazingly', 'classmates', 'mine', 'high', 'school', 'time', 'claimed', 'was', 'boring', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'plots', 'were', 'never', 'heard', 'again.This', '70', 'BBC', 'series', 'classic', 'must', 'have', 'comedy', 'lover', 'Dated', 'place', 'Much', 'writing', 'comedic', 'action', 'still', 'leaps', 'ahead', 'modern', 'fare', 'being', 'one', 'cheapest', 'series', 'produced', 'time', 'BBC', '1974', '.Shows', 'are', 'uncut', 'unadulterated', 'special', 'correction', 'computer', 'fixes', 'small', 'imperfections', 'Thank', 'god', 'very', 'classy', 'straight', 'forward', 'package', 'Mr.', 'Davies', 'Mr.', 'Spiers', 'provide', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'are', 'nearly', 'sleep', 'Davies', 'mostly', 'quiet', 'gurgling', 'stomach', 'constantly', 'providing', 'commentary', 'Spiers', 'heard', 'endlessly', 'drinking', 'smoking', 'exercising', 'Restless', 'Leg', 'Syndrome', 'was', 'shot', 'someone', 'spare', 'bedroom', 'Still', 'good', 'one', 'time', 'listen', 'fans', 'series', 'not', 'just', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'where', 'cameras', 'were', 'position', 'how', 'long', 'make', 'up', 'took']",N/A

While there is talk of a remake, nobody could touch this cast featuring the genius and unknighted John Cleese who probably won't be knighted by the Queen after all. His character, Basil Fawlty, would be appalled by John Cleese's statements about their native Britain. Basil Fawlty runs a small bed and breakfast called Fawlty Towers with his long-time wife, Sybil Fawlty, played by the brilliant Prunella Scales CBE. She could become the next Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire and probably will and hopefully or Lady West if her husband, Timothy West CBE, gets knighted. Cleese's wife, who plays Polly, an aspiring artist, was American born and raised Connie Booth who has become a therapist in London, England and has given up acting. Andrew Sachs plays the always funny Manuel who is from Barcelona and often the subject of Basil's anger and abuse. Poor Manuel, Sachs does him brilliantly. There are supporting characters like the two old senior ladies who are permanent residents and the late funny Berkeley Ballard as a retired military man. Fawlty Towers takes place in Torquay, a seaside town in Southern Britain. As one guest jokes about the lack of sights have been reduced to a page or a brochure.Every episode is brilliantly mastered to fit the right effects of the audience which is constant laughter no matter how silly the circumstances or bizarre. I wished John Cleese well and I can't imagine anything that could replace Fawlty Towers. He gave us this brilliance only leaving us wanting so much more.

No matter what type of humour you like, you will thoroughly enjoy this series.  Indeed, for the person who has yet to experience the sheer enjoyment and utter satisfaction that only well-crafted British comedies can provide, this is the place to start.  It was, in fact, the series that provided my introduction to British comedy just over 10 years ago.  My only regret was not discovering this series (and this genre) sooner!The boxed set contains all twelve 30-minute episodes.  As a point of interest, it took John Cleese and his then-wife Connie Booth six weeks on average to write a single episode--a fact which should come as no suprise given the quality of the episodes, for there is not one that is anything less than a masterpiece.  Indeed, with skilfully interwoven subplots that progress with mounting speed towards an uproarious climax, this is without a doubt the most masterfully written (and certainly one of the most consumately acted) comedy series the world has ever seen.John Cleese stars as the highly-strung, incompetent, socially-inept (not forgetting hen-pecked) innkeeper, Basil Fawlty, relegated to a life of penance in the form of marriage to the capable but overbearing, domineering, and brassy Sybil (Prunella Scales).  Throughout the series, the Fawltys are assisted (or hampered!) in running the hotel by their employees.  Firstly, there is the calm, intelligent, and extremely competent Polly (Connie Booth), a combination waitress, chambermaid, desk clerk, and general saviour without whom the hotel would surely collapse into evern greater chaos.  Then there is Manuel (Andrew Sachs), a Spanish immigrant whose unfamiliarity with the English language and customs results in some of the most hilarious interchanges of dialogue.In addition to witty and comical dialogue, the series is loaded with the most side-splitting slapstick I've ever seen.  Manuel, for all his blunders, is usually the &quot;butt&quot; of numerous very realistic-looking kicks, whacks, and general manhandling by Basil.In conclusion, there are plenty of other well-written, hilarious British comedies around, but Fawlty Towers stands at the pinnacle.  It is the yardstick against which all the others are inevitably measured.  It is, in short, representative of the very best comedy (British or otherwise) ever to be seen.  Extremely highly recommended!(By the way, for those interested, October 2001 saw the UK release of a very good, beautiful quality tribute book entitled Fawlty Towers Fully Booked by Morris Bright and Robert Ross.)",5,The All-Time Funniest Comedy -- Ever!,1010016000,"01 3, 2002",2002,2669,"['are', 'not', 'many', 'videos', 'would', 'give', 'blanket', 'recommendation', 'regardless', 'one', 'tastes', 'one', 'matter', 'what', 'type', 'humour', 'will', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'series', 'Indeed', 'person', 'who', 'yet', 'experience', 'sheer', 'enjoyment', 'utter', 'satisfaction', 'only', 'well-crafted', 'British', 'comedies', 'can', 'provide', 'place', 'start', 'was', 'fact', 'series', 'provided', 'introduction', 'British', 'comedy', 'just', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'only', 'regret', 'was', 'not', 'discovering', 'series', 'genre', 'sooner', 'boxed', 'set', 'twelve', '30-minute', 'episodes', 'point', 'interest', 'took', 'John', 'Cleese', 'then-wife', 'Connie', 'Booth', 'six', 'weeks', 'average', 'write', 'single', 'episode', 'fact', 'should', 'come', 'suprise', 'given', 'quality', 'episodes', 'not', 'one', 'anything', 'less', 'masterpiece', 'Indeed', 'skilfully', 'interwoven', 'subplots', 'progress', 'mounting', 'speed', 'towards', 'uproarious', 'climax', 'doubt', 'most', 'masterfully', 'written', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'consumately', 'acted', 'comedy', 'series', 'world', 'ever', 'seen.John', 'Cleese', 'stars', 'highly-strung', 'incompetent', 'socially-inept', 'not', 'forgetting', 'hen-pecked', 'innkeeper', 'Basil', 'Fawlty', 'relegated', 'life', 'penance', 'form', 'marriage', 'capable', 'overbearing', 'domineering', 'brassy', 'Sybil', 'Prunella', 'Scales', 'series', 'Fawltys', 'are', 'assisted', 'hampered', 'running', 'hotel', 'employees', 'Firstly', 'calm', 'intelligent', 'extremely', 'competent', 'Polly', 'Connie', 'Booth', 'combination', 'waitress', 'chambermaid', 'desk', 'clerk', 'general', 'saviour', 'whom', 'hotel', 'would', 'surely', 'collapse', 'evern', 'greater', 'chaos', 'Then', 'Manuel', 'Andrew', 'Sachs', 'Spanish', 'immigrant', 'unfamiliarity', 'English', 'language', 'customs', 'results', 'most', 'hilarious', 'interchanges', 'dialogue.In', 'addition', 'witty', 'comical', 'dialogue', 'series', 'loaded', 'most', 'side-splitting', 'slapstick', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Manuel', 'blunders', 'usually', 'quot', 'quot', 'numerous', 'very', 'realistic-looking', 'kicks', 'whacks', 'general', 'manhandling', 'Basil.In', 'conclusion', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'well-written', 'hilarious', 'British', 'comedies', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'pinnacle', 'yardstick', 'others', 'are', 'inevitably', 'measured', 'short', 'representative', 'very', 'best', 'comedy', 'British', 'otherwise', 'ever', 'be', 'seen', 'Extremely', 'highly', 'recommended', 'way', 'interested', 'October', '2001', 'saw', 'UK', 'release', 'very', 'good', 'beautiful', 'quality', 'tribute', 'book', 'entitled', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'Fully', 'Booked', 'Morris', 'Bright', 'Robert', 'Ross']",N/A

I simply cannot say enough good things about the show. Even after repeated viewings over many years it is amazingly funny; no surprise there, Cleese and Booth crafted each script for six weeks till the comedy was honed to a razor edge. By limiting themselves to just six shows per series and spacing the two series a few years apart, they were able to spend enough time on each script to ensure that there were no wasted lines or filler, it's pure comedy from start to finish. Nearly every moment of the show is used as an opportunity to generate laughter.The extras on this DVD set are also worth viewing. They include a concise, informative interview with John Cleese, a brief bit about the fate of the building used as Fawlty Towers in the show, a documentary on the Gleneagles Hotel in England which inspired the show, and more.My only complaint about this DVD set and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the picture quality. The picture quality is simply inexcusable for DVD. It is grainy and fuzzy in many spots and there are even some color anomalies that pop up occasionally. A show of this caliber certainly deserves better, especially on a medium that can provide terrific picture quality. My old VHS copy of the show had a better picture quality. The DVD at times looks degraded in a way similar to a VHS tape that has been watched hundreds of times.Picture quality notwithstanding, any comedy fan, especially those who appreciate off-beat comedy like Monty Python's Flying Circus, Black Adder, Mystery Science Theater 3000, Red Dwarf, etc. will LOVE Fawlty Towers.

It is one of my favorite shows, and if you choose to watch it, it might go near the top of your list too. John Cleese plays the role of Basil Fawlty to perfection, a rude, and very stressed hotel owner. I believe that no other person could ever have played Basil Fawlty nearly as well as John Cleese.Basil Fawlty is supposed to be a horrible person, but I'd say when it comes to how he treats the people who stay at his hotel, some of them are worse than he is. The child from Gourmet Night, the man from Waldorf Salad, and many others further prove this thought.Anyway, Basil Fawlty runs the hotel with his sensible yet talkative wife Sybil (Prunela Scales), and one questions their marriage. Working at Fawlty Towers is the smart, quick-witted, artist Polly (Connie Booth), who is often dragged in to Basil's scams and such. Also working there is the hard working, yet extremely bad at English, Manuel (Andrew Sachs), a worker hired from Barcelona, as well as the chef Terry (season 2).My personal favorite episode of this show is the hilarious The Germans, one of John Cleese's best performances in my opinion (""Don't mention the war! I mentioned it once, but I think I got away with it""). So please, do yourself a favor and buy this 3-disc set containing all twelve episodes of Fawlty Towers, and you can own some of the greatest half hours in the history of television.",5,Fawlty Towers-Great Britcom!,1091318400,"08 1, 2004",2004,1449,"['Fawlty', 'Towers', 'opinion', 'one', 'greatest', 'Britcoms', 'time', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'choose', 'watch', 'might', 'go', 'top', 'list', 'too', 'John', 'Cleese', 'role', 'Basil', 'Fawlty', 'perfection', 'rude', 'very', 'stressed', 'hotel', 'owner', 'believe', 'other', 'person', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'played', 'Basil', 'Fawlty', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'John', 'Cleese.Basil', 'Fawlty', 'supposed', 'be', 'horrible', 'person', ""'d"", 'say', 'when', 'how', 'people', 'who', 'stay', 'hotel', 'are', 'worse', 'child', 'Gourmet', 'Night', 'man', 'Waldorf', 'Salad', 'many', 'others', 'further', 'prove', 'thought.Anyway', 'Basil', 'Fawlty', 'hotel', 'sensible', 'yet', 'talkative', 'wife', 'Sybil', 'Prunela', 'Scales', 'one', 'questions', 'marriage', 'Working', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'smart', 'quick-witted', 'artist', 'Polly', 'Connie', 'Booth', 'who', 'often', 'dragged', 'Basil', 'scams', 'such', 'Also', 'working', 'hard', 'working', 'yet', 'extremely', 'bad', 'English', 'Manuel', 'Andrew', 'Sachs', 'worker', 'hired', 'Barcelona', 'as', 'well', 'chef', 'Terry', 'season', '2', '.My', 'personal', 'favorite', 'episode', 'show', 'hilarious', 'Germans', 'one', 'John', 'Cleese', 'best', 'performances', 'opinion', 'Do', ""n't"", 'mention', 'war', 'mentioned', 'once', 'think', 'got', 'away', 'So', 'please', 'do', 'favor', 'buy', '3-disc', 'set', 'containing', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'can', 'own', 'greatest', 'half', 'hours', 'history', 'television']",N/A
