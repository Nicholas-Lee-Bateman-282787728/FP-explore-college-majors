But since I love Shiva, so I decided to get it.  Don't bother with the ""Core Abs"" one, as you can get the same exercises from these two.  I'm not very experienced at yoga, so I can't do much in Shakti, this one provides a nice alternative to prevent from getting bored.

I usually combine her core dvd's with various other yoga dvd's or after I am done running. They aren't enough to do just by themselves, but I don't think they were meant to be. I usually combine this DVD with a Power Yoga (Power Yoga by Bryan Kest is my favorite) or with any other strong upper body set of yoga. As like all of her other DVD's, the background is simply breathtaking and gorgeous, it's enough to just watch that by itself! The music is always good. It does have a lot of the same moves as the other two core DVD's so if you're looking to save a little money, maybe just get the Creative Core DVD.",4,Good to combine with other workouts,1254960000,"10 8, 2009",2009,710,"['own', 'three', 'Shiva', 'core', 'workouts', 'pack', 'punch', 'just', '20', 'minutes', 'usually', 'combine', 'core', 'dvd', 'various', 'other', 'yoga', 'dvd', 'am', 'done', 'running', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'do', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'usually', 'combine', 'DVD', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'Bryan', 'Kest', 'favorite', 'other', 'strong', 'upper', 'body', 'set', 'yoga', 'other', 'DVD', 'background', 'simply', 'breathtaking', 'gorgeous', 'enough', 'just', 'watch', 'music', 'always', 'good', 'have', 'lot', 'same', 'moves', 'other', 'two', 'core', 'DVD', 'so', ""'re"", 'looking', 'save', 'little', 'money', 'maybe', 'just', 'get', 'Creative', 'Core', 'DVD']",Shiva Rea: Creative Core & Lower Body
1169929,AXZ085P4SPXVL,B001B1Q2TK,"Just Breathe ""Just Breathe""","[3, 3]","I absolutlely love this DVD for days when I don't have a lot of time.  I usually do the bonus footage first as a warm-up then do the remainder of the DVD which makes for a total time of approximately 34 minutes.  Even though the practice is short, afterwards I feel centered, calm and strong.  The lower body portion is a refreshing change from typically vinyasas that usually use chaturanga to up dog, to down dog as home base.  Instead the yoga squat position is your home base as you flow between sides doing standing poses eventually creating your own flow based upon how you are feeling that day.  I also like the abdominal section.  very creative!*** Edited to add:  I have been using this DVD once or twice a month for some time now and this DVD practice continues to grow on me.  As mentioned above, use the bonus footage as a warm-up before beginning the standing pose flow.  The standing pose flow has some deep hip bending and stretching (side warrior, deep squats, long holding of poses).  I wanted to address the issue of the core workout.  I noticed that several people didn't care for the core work.  I absolutely love the core work here.  I enjoy starting with breathing bridge and one legged bridges because at that point in the practice after the standing poses my body is really craving some backbending.  I also enjoy that it is very different core work from her other DVDs.  You do some planks on hands and then move to your elbows and back to your hands a couple of times.  You also do side plank.My only complaint about the DVD is that I could use a couple more moments to slow down before going into savasana.  I have to stop the DVD and do my own savasana.  I can still feel my blood pumping strong in my veins if I follow the dvd into savasana.  Also, the savasana is short and when over goes back to the dvd menu which has music.  I just shut it down after core work and do my own savasana for as long as I like!",5,Short yoga practice when short on time,1255046400,"10 9, 2009",2009,1939,"['absolutlely', 'love', 'DVD', 'days', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'time', 'usually', 'do', 'bonus', 'footage', 'first', 'warm-up', 'then', 'do', 'remainder', 'DVD', 'total', 'time', 'approximately', '34', 'minutes', 'Even', 'practice', 'short', 'afterwards', 'feel', 'centered', 'calm', 'strong', 'lower', 'body', 'portion', 'refreshing', 'change', 'typically', 'vinyasas', 'usually', 'use', 'chaturanga', 'up', 'dog', 'down', 'dog', 'home', 'base', 'Instead', 'yoga', 'squat', 'position', 'home', 'base', 'flow', 'sides', 'doing', 'standing', 'poses', 'eventually', 'creating', 'own', 'flow', 'based', 'how', 'are', 'feeling', 'day', 'also', 'abdominal', 'section', 'very', 'creative', '***', 'Edited', 'add', 'have', 'been', 'using', 'DVD', 'once', 'twice', 'month', 'time', 'now', 'DVD', 'practice', 'grow', 'mentioned', 'use', 'bonus', 'footage', 'warm-up', 'beginning', 'standing', 'pose', 'flow', 'standing', 'pose', 'flow', 'deep', 'hip', 'bending', 'stretching', 'side', 'warrior', 'deep', 'squats', 'long', 'holding', 'poses', 'wanted', 'address', 'issue', 'core', 'workout', 'noticed', 'several', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'core', 'work', 'absolutely', 'love', 'core', 'work', 'here', 'enjoy', 'starting', 'breathing', 'bridge', 'one', 'legged', 'bridges', 'because', 'point', 'practice', 'standing', 'poses', 'body', 'really', 'craving', 'backbending', 'also', 'enjoy', 'very', 'different', 'core', 'work', 'other', 'DVDs', 'do', 'planks', 'hands', 'then', 'move', 'elbows', 'back', 'hands', 'couple', 'times', 'also', 'do', 'side', 'plank.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'DVD', 'could', 'use', 'couple', 'more', 'moments', 'slow', 'down', 'before', 'going', 'savasana', 'have', 'stop', 'DVD', 'do', 'own', 'savasana', 'can', 'still', 'feel', 'blood', 'pumping', 'strong', 'veins', 'follow', 'dvd', 'savasana', 'Also', 'savasana', 'short', 'when', 'over', 'back', 'dvd', 'menu', 'music', 'just', 'shut', 'down', 'core', 'work', 'do', 'own', 'savasana', 'as', 'long', 'like']",Shiva Rea: Creative Core & Lower Body

I did the workout this morning, starting with the bonus track from Fluid power, followed by the lower body flow and the abdominal section. The lower body flow had about four things that were new and new is good, but they weren't very exciting: leaning forward in yogic squat, drawing arms back behind you then forward, reaching in front of you. OK, that was new.If you are new to Shiva Rea, I think you would be lost during the very brief ""do your own flow"" piece at the end of the lower body section. The warrior II to reverse warrior to side angle is really no different than the sequence in the long standing pose flow on Fluid Power. Just Shiva's outfit and the Kauaii backdrop are new.The ab section, if you already have a strong core, is OK. I like the rocking bridge flow, but that, to me, is the best part of the whole DVD: 1-2 minutes. I could do the rocking bridge flow for probably 10 minutes before I even felt it.  The abdominal section just ends as if they ran out of money, time or attention span and you are just dumped into Shavasana, which is only 2 minutes.I own all of Shiva's CDs/""audiobooks"", Creative Core Abs 1, Fluid Power, Yoga Shakti and Yoga Trance Dance. I feel that this production is nowhere near as well done as any of the other products of hers I own and use.

With that being said, even though this was not a vinyasa, she still brought her signature ""flow"" style to the workout.

It stands out as unique in the overcrowded vinyasa dvd market. It is also in my opinion the best produced, most beautiful yoga dvd ever. My next was Creative Core Abs which I did not fancy. I thought it was fresh and well produced, but it just wasnt my style. I hesistated with the Creative Core Lower and Upper Body dvds because I did not something similar to Creative Core Abs. I was prompted by the reviews to take a chance on them and I am so glad I got them. I did both the lower and upper body today and found them fascinating including the core sections. This is real yoga and yet it is truly creative. I see the influence of classical Indian dance in the way Shiva ""flows"" from pose to pose - especially in her arm / hand movements. The choreography of the vinyasa on the lower body video and the core section is truly beautiful without straying too far from classic yoga asana which I thought happned with Creative Core Abs.

Shiva Rea offers alternatives to some of the poses, including more advanced poses. The sequence is quite beautiful, full of great stretches that simply flow in a pleasant manner for much enjoyment of this practice. Towards the end of this section, a more advanced pose is also included to challenge you and your balance. Includes counter poses, which I find are very helpful, and I'm very glad of this addition. Finalising with wisdom pose. Shiva Rea's warmth literally radiates from this workout, encouraging you as you practice, and also ready to welcome you back next time, and probably much sooner as she is so full of positivity that you will want to practice more often.Creative Core (9 mins) Commencing with the beautiful spiritual greeting of Namaste, and onto the rocking bridge, followed by some dynamic highly energetic movements (practice on a day of high energy to make the most of this sequence), half table, to side plank, plank, and one difficult pose. Shiva Rea offers firm encouragement that is tangible and very welcomed to further ones practice to greater levels every day.Shavasana (2 mins) Set to beautiful music, with the chant &#34;Shanti&#34;, showing the beautiful surrounding scenery to aid your relaxation, should you happen to look up and not keep your eyes closed!Best for intermediate, but some of the poses will be suitable for beginners, and some also suitable for advanced.",5,Invigorating programme with some advanced poses,1400457600,"05 19, 2014",2014,1700,"['Filmed', 'Limahuli', 'Garden', 'Hawaiian', 'island', 'Kauai', 'DVD', 'dynamic', 'programme', 'stunning', 'scenery', 'enjoy', 'whilst', 'practice.The', 'workouts', 'are', '-Creative', 'Roots', '13', 'mins', 'Commences', 'Yogic', 'squat', 'wide', 'angled', 'pose', 'side', 'angled', 'pose', 'side', 'warrior', 'more', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'alternatives', 'poses', 'including', 'more', 'advanced', 'poses', 'sequence', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'full', 'great', 'stretches', 'simply', 'flow', 'pleasant', 'manner', 'much', 'enjoyment', 'practice', 'end', 'section', 'more', 'advanced', 'pose', 'also', 'included', 'challenge', 'balance', 'counter', 'poses', 'find', 'are', 'very', 'helpful', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'addition', 'Finalising', 'wisdom', 'pose', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'warmth', 'literally', 'workout', 'encouraging', 'practice', 'also', 'ready', 'welcome', 'back', 'next', 'time', 'probably', 'much', 'sooner', 'so', 'full', 'positivity', 'will', 'want', 'practice', 'more', 'often.Creative', 'Core', '9', 'mins', 'Commencing', 'beautiful', 'spiritual', 'greeting', 'Namaste', 'rocking', 'bridge', 'followed', 'dynamic', 'highly', 'energetic', 'movements', 'practice', 'day', 'high', 'energy', 'make', 'most', 'sequence', 'half', 'table', 'side', 'plank', 'plank', 'one', 'difficult', 'pose', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'firm', 'encouragement', 'tangible', 'very', 'welcomed', 'further', 'ones', 'practice', 'greater', 'levels', 'day.Shavasana', '2', 'mins', 'Set', 'beautiful', 'music', 'chant', '34', 'Shanti', '34', 'showing', 'beautiful', 'surrounding', 'scenery', 'aid', 'relaxation', 'should', 'happen', 'look', 'up', 'not', 'keep', 'eyes', 'closed', 'Best', 'intermediate', 'poses', 'will', 'be', 'suitable', 'beginners', 'also', 'suitable', 'advanced']",Shiva Rea: Creative Core & Lower Body
