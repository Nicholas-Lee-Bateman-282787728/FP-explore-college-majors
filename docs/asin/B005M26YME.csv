It was a thrill to get this DVD, as it was a virtual duplicate of what I saw.  I suppose it surprises no one that this man likes things how he likes them, so when he puts together a show, it's the same to every detail, from where he stands for each bar of each song, to how he reacts to the audience cheering, to the outfit he's decided is his tour garb.I've never seen his solo shows before, and it was a nice mix of his solo work, but thankfully not at the exclusion of making his big Fleetwood Mac hits the centerpiece of the show.  I do enjoy the ""Seeds We Sow"" album, in particular ""That's the Way that Love Goes"" is my favorite.  The band infuses it with energy, the kind that is missing from his studio albums because of how meticulously and re-tracked those things are put together.It's one of the highlights of my show going that while I was up front, LB got right in my face to play the wicked ""I'm So Afraid"" solo.  It's the closest I'll get to a private concert from the man.",5,Great document of an excellent tour,1336003200,"05 3, 2012",2012,1100,"['was', 'LB', 'show', 'six', 'months', 'later', 'Regency', 'San', 'Francisco', 'was', 'spectacular', 'experience', 'was', 'thrill', 'get', 'DVD', 'was', 'virtual', 'duplicate', 'what', 'saw', 'suppose', 'one', 'man', 'things', 'how', 'so', 'when', 'together', 'show', 'same', 'detail', 'where', 'bar', 'song', 'how', 'audience', 'cheering', 'outfit', 'decided', 'tour', 'garb.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'solo', 'shows', 'was', 'nice', 'mix', 'solo', 'work', 'thankfully', 'not', 'exclusion', 'making', 'big', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'centerpiece', 'show', 'do', 'enjoy', 'Seeds', 'Sow', 'album', 'particular', 'Way', 'Love', 'Goes', 'favorite', 'band', 'energy', 'kind', 'missing', 'studio', 'albums', 'how', 'meticulously', 're-tracked', 'things', 'are', 'put', 'one', 'highlights', 'show', 'going', 'was', 'up', 'front', 'LB', 'got', 'right', 'face', 'play', 'wicked', ""'m"", 'So', 'Afraid', 'solo', 'closest', ""'ll"", 'get', 'private', 'concert', 'man']",N/A

I think they would either sell alot more or maybe less.Dont get me wrong buckingham is one of the finest artist I've ever heard.

This really is a great show and the new stuff on this CD is really enjoyable.  I purchased the DVD/CD combo and it's great to have the CD for the car and to easily transfer to an iPod or PC.  My only small complaint with this DVD is the the set list has an awful lot of tracks included in his two other DVD's.  This review is supposed to be about this disc, so I do give it five stars, but would have taken off a star for variey if reviewing all of the DVD's together.  His last DVD for example (Live from Bass Hall) from only a couple years back includes several of these same songs.  Of 19 songs on this DVD, almost half  - ""Shut Us Down"", Go Insane, Big Love, Trouble, Never Going Back Again, Second Hand News, Go Your Own Way, Under The Skin and I'm So Afraid are all repeated.  A couple of great songs from his 1993 CD are included however and sound great (""Turn It On"" and ""All My Sorrows""), it would have been a real treat to have a few more of those.",5,Great Concert!
