1414207,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B004LWL0LG,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[14, 18]","-----------------------------------------------------""The Best Of The Dean Martin Variety Show""(Time-Life, 2011)-----------------------------------------------------A fascinating pop culture time-capsule.  Launched in 1965 and lasting for nine years, NBC's ""Dean Martin Show"" was a major fixture on the television landscape during the peak years of the hippie era and a signpost of the Generation Gap.  Although it was a prerecorded production, the premise of the Dean Martin show -- a loosey-goosey variety show hosted by a permanently sozzled sot -- often gave the show a live feel.  A big part of the fun was laughing along while Martin flubbed his lines or lost his place while reading cues cards, all with an air of intentional, good-natured self-deprecation.  Martin's high spirits, informality and unpredictability made his guests have to think on their toes - while some musical numbers and comedy bits were tightly directed, the show's real sizzle came when Martin interacted with his guests, goofing around and cracking them up, maintaining the back-slapping frat-house feel of the ""celebrity roast"" shows he often hosted. It's a chance to see a bunch of old-school film and music stars letting their hair down, sort of like one long continuous blooper reel, and a backstage window into the showbiz culture of yesteryear.The calibre of the talent helps: this volume features heavies such as Bob Hope, Jimmy Stewart, John Wayne, Orson Wells, Peggy Lee, a hyperactive youngster named Joel Gray, the babyfaced ""Bonanza""-era Michael Douglas, Jack Benny, George Burns, Nipsey Russell, Dom Deluise and many others.  It's very old-school, mostly representatives of the pre-Sixties old guard, folks who shared many cultural assumptions and associations that were hopelessly ""square"" for many younger viewers, and for today's audience some aspects, such as the show's sexism and occasional homophobia may wear thin or even seem appalling.  (On the other hand, if you've been watching ""Mad Men,"" this show makes a great supplement, showing that the ""Mad Men"" writers really got it right: chainsmoking monologues, drinking jokes, mother-in-law jokes, wife jokes, golfing jokes, Phyllis Diller jokes -- definitely stuff from another time.)There was also lots of genuine improv: just look at the disbelief on Jimmy Stewart's face when Martin flashes a girly-mag centerfold (off-camera) during a barbershop sketch... In the hip, swinging '60s, this unscripted chaos was the closest Americans could get to the wild-and-wooly days of early live TV a decade earlier.  Fans of David Letterman in particular might appreciate Martin's deconstructionist approach to the medium... it's easy to see how his madcap, warts-and-all style lives on in the late-night shows of today.This collection differs from earlier Dean Martin home video sets in one big way - instead of creating long gag reels drawn from various shows, it presents material from individual programs -- September 23, 1965; April 3, 1969; November 23, 1972, etc. -- which gives a greater sense of history and puts the performers and material in context.  The shows are heavily edited, presumably because of difficulty securing rights to current pop songs, etc.  Still, it's great stuff - this'll bring back memories and laughs for old-timers and give future generations a glimpse back into an antique pop culture during a time of major social transition. As Mister Spock might say: fascinating.

Did someone in the family just sign off on it without looking it over? As I was watching this last night, I thought, ""who screwed up, who dropped the ball?""We all love Dean and don't get me wrong we will take anything with Dean's Show but for the love of GOD do a better job! This is the second attempt at getting this straightened out and it has gotten worse. We want to see DEAN! I think all of us love Dean's kids they seem like and I heard from people who have met them, great down to earth people. Here is what needs to happen next:1) The family has to get a hold of Amazon and apologize for this sad case of ""FULL EPISODES"" of the show2) They need to regroup and simply put out the best of Dean 1965, 1966 and so forth. The FULL episodes and if you can't get the permission from people, then put on the package the BEST CLIPS of 1965.3) NO more interviews with people, we have seen and read them all. We get it. The last disc should be of every ""couch"" song he did that year. Hell even sell it as one dvd, call it Dean Relaxing! People would buy it!!4) Get together with the Sinatra estate (just don't get Barbara and the kids in the same room) and get the 1967 Christmas special done!Each year you sadly lose more Dean fans because of old age.

I purchased this at the warehouse and viewed the first 3 episodes with my wife tonight.  The episodes are between 23 and 28 minutes long.  These are edited down to about half the original broadcast.  Do not get me wrong.  Some of the skits are very funny.  The barbarshop scene w/ orsen wells and Jimmy Stewart made me laugh for its 5 minutes of wit.  But the episodes all have end credits that show snapshots of scenes from the show broadcast, and you can guess easily what you are missing on the DvD realease.In addition, the audio mixing is terrible.  Watching this DvD with a 5.1 system, you loose vocal in the center channal at the end of the first episode/ disk 1.  If these broadcasts were recorded in Mono, realease them in Mono.  Fans will not criticize Dvd producers for that, but I will criticize the mixing here.

Schnitzer,"[11, 16]","UPDATE (posted July 31, 2011): Now that The Golddiggers Super Site has confirmed that Time-Life is going forward with a SECOND edition of DVDs culled from The Dean Martin Show, we thought that this would be an auspicious time for a detailed and objective examination of the first collection, assembled with the aim of improving future installments.Toward that end, we've reviewed the T-L sets' pluses and minuses, taken into consideration many of the criticisms expressed here on Amazon, and offered some informative background on both Dean's series and the complexities of clearing music for vintage television programs.Beyond just surveying what's come before, we've additionally cast an eye toward what's next, by advancing a series of practical, viable solutions for avoiding some of the pitfalls of this initial release in future reissues.And to make it easier for connoisseurs of this material to know exactly what they're getting (and what they're not), we've provided a painstakingly-researched appendix that takes the 20 episodes in Time-Life's 6-DVD set and compares the original musical content of those shows when they were first broadcast on NBC with not only the musical selections contained in Time-Life's reissue of those episodes, but also, with the musical portions of those episodes that can be found on the earlier 29-volume Guthy-Renker collection.For the most sweeping and unbiased look at this subject available anywhere, simply type into any search engine the phrase: Updates/The Golddiggers Super SiteAnd we cordially invite anyone who has written a review of the Time-Life sets on these pages to add it to our site and/or comment on our article, where such postings are guaranteed to be read by those who will shape future releases of material from The Dean Martin Show.ORIGINAL PREVIEW (posted April 18, 2011):This collection is the one of three forthcoming releases representing the first new group of DVDs culled from episodes of The Dean Martin Show in 8 years, with the selections being produced this time around by Time-Life Video from footage supplied directly from NBC, the network that broadcast all 9 seasons of Dean's wildly popular variety series.These new products - unlike the older ones from Guthy-Renker composed of segments drawn from different episodes and seasons of the program all mixed together - are arranged by individual episodes, with the 6-DVD set containing 20 episodes in all, featuring more than 50 guest stars and a total of 80 musical performances -- many of the latter making their official debut on DVD. The only advance, in-depth rundown of the guest star lineups and original air dates of the shows included on all three of the new Best of The Dean Martin Variety Show DVD sets can be found by using a search engine to locate: Updates/The Golddiggers Super Site (a site named after the female singer-dancers who became famous for their appearances on both Dean's TV series and their own).",5,New Dean Martin Show Collection Contains Many 1st Time-on-DVD Musical Numbers,1303084800,"04 18, 2011",2011,2950,"['UPDATE', 'posted', 'July', '31', '2011', 'Now', 'Golddiggers', 'Super', 'Site', 'confirmed', 'Time-Life', 'going', 'forward', 'SECOND', 'edition', 'DVDs', 'culled', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Show', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'auspicious', 'time', 'detailed', 'objective', 'examination', 'first', 'collection', 'assembled', 'aim', 'improving', 'future', 'installments.Toward', 'end', ""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'T-L', 'sets', 'pluses', 'minuses', 'taken', 'consideration', 'many', 'criticisms', 'expressed', 'here', 'Amazon', 'offered', 'informative', 'background', 'Dean', 'series', 'complexities', 'clearing', 'music', 'vintage', 'television', 'programs.Beyond', 'just', 'surveying', 'what', 'come', 'before', ""'ve"", 'additionally', 'cast', 'eye', 'what', 'next', 'advancing', 'series', 'practical', 'viable', 'solutions', 'avoiding', 'pitfalls', 'initial', 'release', 'future', 'reissues.And', 'make', 'easier', 'connoisseurs', 'material', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'what', ""'re"", 'not', ""'ve"", 'provided', 'painstakingly-researched', 'appendix', '20', 'episodes', 'Time-Life', '6-DVD', 'set', 'original', 'musical', 'content', 'shows', 'when', 'were', 'first', 'broadcast', 'NBC', 'not', 'only', 'musical', 'selections', 'contained', 'Time-Life', 'reissue', 'episodes', 'also', 'musical', 'portions', 'episodes', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'earlier', '29-volume', 'Guthy-Renker', 'collection.For', 'most', 'sweeping', 'unbiased', 'look', 'subject', 'available', 'anywhere', 'simply', 'type', 'search', 'engine', 'phrase', 'Updates/The', 'Golddiggers', 'Super', 'SiteAnd', 'cordially', 'invite', 'anyone', 'who', 'written', 'review', 'Time-Life', 'sets', 'pages', 'add', 'site', 'and/or', 'comment', 'article', 'where', 'such', 'postings', 'are', 'guaranteed', 'be', 'read', 'who', 'will', 'shape', 'future', 'releases', 'material', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Show.ORIGINAL', 'PREVIEW', 'posted', 'April', '18', '2011', 'collection', 'one', 'three', 'forthcoming', 'releases', 'representing', 'first', 'new', 'group', 'DVDs', 'culled', 'episodes', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Show', '8', 'years', 'selections', 'being', 'produced', 'time', 'around', 'Time-Life', 'Video', 'footage', 'supplied', 'directly', 'NBC', 'network', 'broadcast', '9', 'seasons', 'Dean', 'wildly', 'popular', 'variety', 'series.These', 'new', 'products', 'older', 'ones', 'Guthy-Renker', 'composed', 'segments', 'drawn', 'different', 'episodes', 'seasons', 'program', 'mixed', 'together', 'are', 'arranged', 'individual', 'episodes', '6-DVD', 'set', 'containing', '20', 'episodes', 'featuring', 'more', '50', 'guest', 'stars', 'total', '80', 'musical', 'performances', 'many', 'latter', 'making', 'official', 'debut', 'DVD', 'only', 'advance', 'in-depth', 'rundown', 'guest', 'star', 'lineups', 'original', 'air', 'dates', 'shows', 'included', 'three', 'new', 'Best', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Variety', 'Show', 'DVD', 'sets', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'using', 'search', 'engine', 'locate', 'Updates/The', 'Golddiggers', 'Super', 'Site', 'site', 'named', 'female', 'singer-dancers', 'who', 'became', 'famous', 'appearances', 'Dean', 'TV', 'series', 'own']",N/A

This is the first time that Dean Martin's Variety Show is available without the need to subscribe to the series by mail-order only. I don't give out compliments if they are not warranted, and I would not participate in anything I thought wasn't in the best interest of Dean Martin and the Dean Martin family. I am honored to have had a small involvement in the production of these DVD's.As a former NBC executive myself, I was there from the beginning, at almost every taping at studio 4 in our Burbank, California studios. I can attest to the fact that these shows have all the same original flavor of the original series broadcasts because the executive consultant on this project was none other than Lee Hale, the show's original Musical Director and later Producer.Available as an individual DVD, a two-DVD-set and the mega six-volume set, ""The Best of Dean Martin Variety Series"" is absolutely the best collection yet of entertaining moments from Dean's hugely popular TV show. Unlike the former releases (available by mail-order), Time-Life has taken the approach to keep as much of the individual episodes in the exact order they were originally broadcast in, with editing only the commercials and occasional copyrighted material. This is Dean and his guests at their finest.(If still up) An advanced 5-minute promo is posted on You Tube under ""The Best of The Dean Martin Show"" (using the key words 'Time Life') and also on our Fan Center Website. See for yourself. These brilliant episodes have been culled from the original 2-inch quad masters, with the audio being re-mastered to it's finest.Also included on the DVD's are the extra bonus interviews from celebrities who appeared on the show (Phyllis Diller, Jonathan Winters, Norm Crosby, Lanie Kazan, Florence Henderson, Carol Lawrence, Angie Dickinson, and Original Golddigger Susie Lund Ewing), as well as the show's original Musical Director (later producer) Lee Hale, and commentary by Dean Martin's own daughter, Gail Martin Downey (who appeared on her father's show many times and even hosted the Dean Martin Summer Show).If you remember The Dean Martin Show or want to see television when it was at it's best - this is it! Even though video tape was being used in those days, this show never stopped for mistakes, leaving in all the flubs and blunders as they actually happened. That's because these entertainers (Especially Dean) could rebound and laugh along with everyone else while having the 'time' of his 'life'. Maybe that's an omen why ""Time Life"" is the company producing these with care!For a complete rundown of what is on each of these individual DVD's with their original airdates, check out the ""Dean Martin Fan Center"" Website and order through Amazon now!",5,From The President of The Dean Martin Fan Center and former NBC Executive,1303084800,"04 18, 2011",2011,2876,"['Presiding', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Fan', 'Center', 'have', 'first', 'hand', 'knowledge', 'what', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'wanting', 'years', 'first', 'time', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Variety', 'Show', 'available', 'need', 'subscribe', 'series', 'mail-order', 'only', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'out', 'compliments', 'are', 'not', 'warranted', 'would', 'not', 'participate', 'anything', 'thought', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'interest', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'family', 'am', 'honored', 'have', 'had', 'small', 'involvement', 'production', ""DVD's.As"", 'former', 'NBC', 'executive', 'was', 'there', 'beginning', 'almost', 'taping', 'studio', '4', 'Burbank', 'California', 'studios', 'can', 'attest', 'fact', 'shows', 'have', 'same', 'original', 'flavor', 'original', 'series', 'broadcasts', 'executive', 'consultant', 'project', 'was', 'none', 'other', 'Lee', 'Hale', 'show', 'original', 'Musical', 'Director', 'later', 'Producer.Available', 'individual', 'DVD', 'two-DVD-set', 'mega', 'six-volume', 'set', 'Best', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Variety', 'Series', 'absolutely', 'best', 'collection', 'yet', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'Dean', 'hugely', 'popular', 'TV', 'show', 'former', 'releases', 'available', 'mail-order', 'Time-Life', 'taken', 'approach', 'keep', 'much', 'individual', 'episodes', 'exact', 'order', 'were', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'editing', 'only', 'commercials', 'occasional', 'copyrighted', 'material', 'Dean', 'guests', 'finest', 'still', 'up', 'advanced', '5-minute', 'promo', 'posted', 'Tube', 'Best', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Show', 'using', 'key', 'words', 'Life', 'also', 'Fan', 'Center', 'Website', 'See', 'brilliant', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'culled', 'original', '2-inch', 'quad', 'masters', 'audio', 'being', 're-mastered', 'finest.Also', 'included', 'DVD', 'are', 'extra', 'bonus', 'interviews', 'celebrities', 'who', 'appeared', 'show', 'Phyllis', 'Diller', 'Jonathan', 'Winters', 'Norm', 'Crosby', 'Lanie', 'Kazan', 'Florence', 'Henderson', 'Carol', 'Lawrence', 'Angie', 'Dickinson', 'Original', 'Golddigger', 'Susie', 'Lund', 'Ewing', 'as', 'well', 'show', 'original', 'Musical', 'Director', 'later', 'producer', 'Lee', 'Hale', 'commentary', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'own', 'daughter', 'Gail', 'Martin', 'Downey', 'who', 'appeared', 'father', 'show', 'many', 'times', 'even', 'hosted', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Summer', 'Show', '.If', 'remember', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Show', 'want', 'see', 'television', 'when', 'was', 'best', 'Even', 'video', 'tape', 'was', 'being', 'used', 'days', 'show', 'never', 'stopped', 'mistakes', 'leaving', 'flubs', 'blunders', 'actually', 'happened', 'entertainers', 'Especially', 'Dean', 'could', 'rebound', 'everyone', 'else', 'having', ""'time"", ""'"", ""'life"", 'omen', 'why', 'Time', 'Life', 'company', 'producing', 'care', 'complete', 'rundown', 'what', 'individual', 'DVD', 'original', 'airdates', 'check', 'out', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Fan', 'Center', 'Website', 'order', 'Amazon', 'now']",N/A

The sound quality is a bit uneven in places.  As mentioned, these are not complete episodes.  Some are about 20 minutes in length up to a bit over 30 minutes.  They are, however, excerpts from individual episodes.  So you see much of what was on one particular episode, but not the entire episode.  Disappointingly, quite a few of the episodes do not have either Dean's solo opening number or the ""serious"" song mid-show with Ken Lane featured on piano.

1414231,A3MGHKJ7PSD6I4,B004LWL0LG,W. Hawkins,"[7, 16]","This collection was a disappointment. Nearly all the musical numbers have been cut from the episodes. I assume this is because of the costs associated with securing rights to the songs. How foolish is it for agents and performers to set their rates so high that their music disappears from view (and they collect nothing)! So what you get are interviews and comedy sketches, and maybe a song or two from Dean. The earlier ""best of"" series was much better as it focused on the musical numbers. Another missing element are ""Dean's Girls""--- the Golddiggers and the Dingaling Sisters. Since they did mainly musical numbers (their own or as backups for guest stars), they have been cut from the episodes except for when they do introductions. At the end of each episode, you can see stills from the many segments that were cut from the DVD as the credits roll. And don't look for Joey Heatherton or Ann-Margret, they are not in this set. You'll have to settle for Florence Henderson.",2,Missing almost all the music,1309046400,"06 26, 2011",2011,979,"['collection', 'was', 'disappointment', 'Nearly', 'musical', 'numbers', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'episodes', 'assume', 'costs', 'associated', 'securing', 'rights', 'songs', 'How', 'foolish', 'agents', 'performers', 'set', 'rates', 'so', 'high', 'music', 'view', 'collect', 'nothing', 'So', 'what', 'get', 'are', 'interviews', 'comedy', 'sketches', 'maybe', 'song', 'two', 'Dean', 'earlier', 'best', 'series', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'focused', 'musical', 'numbers', 'missing', 'element', 'are', 'Dean', 'Girls', 'Golddiggers', 'Dingaling', 'Sisters', 'did', 'mainly', 'musical', 'numbers', 'own', 'backups', 'guest', 'stars', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'episodes', 'when', 'do', 'introductions', 'end', 'episode', 'can', 'see', 'stills', 'many', 'segments', 'were', 'cut', 'DVD', 'credits', 'roll', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'Joey', 'Heatherton', 'Ann-Margret', 'are', 'not', 'set', ""'ll"", 'have', 'settle', 'Florence', 'Henderson']",N/A
