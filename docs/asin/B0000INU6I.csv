781846,A34KD3WLLNZW8,B0000INU6I,,"[3, 3]","I had been really struggling with teaching my 5 yr old son his phonics with an intensive and sometimes boring curriculum, we were both tired and bored with it, but I was still struggling thru...he was learning it but wasn't enjoying it.  I took time off and got the first 3 Leap Frog DVD's so he *might* still learn something and not go backwards while we regained our desire to teach phonics and learning to read......we took several months off and he watched the DVD's several times per month and the other day I decided to sing the songs like they do (while we were driving in the car) and I'd leave the letter sound blank and let him fill it in  EX: ""The A says____, the A says ____, Every Letter Makes a sound the A says ___""  He could do almost all of them!!!!  I was so surprised and happy!  After all that effort and hard time of trying to teach him all I had to do was pop in a DVD?  Granted not a complete curriculum but it sure gave us a break and a step up with phonics!  THANKS LEAP FROG for making these DVD's.  I have only let him watch the first two I am saving the 3rd one for a little later.  They sure helped us.  BTW my 3 yr old Son is also running around sounding out small words he saw on the DVD, and sings the sounds all the time while he plays!  What an exciting time!  I will use these as a supplement for all the kids learning to read program!

However, the delays have, understandably, affected his learning in some areas.While his spatial skills have been way above average--as has his grasp of science (such as planets and their attributes)--he has resisted reading.

My son watches it quite often, and he's now reading books on his own. I can see a marked difference in a matter of WEEKS. Before, he had to think about how some of the letters sounded. Now, he rattles them off like a pro--as well as 3-letter words!This DVD also teaches about vowels and consonants, so he's learning how the vowels are sticky like glue, holding words together (thanks to Professor Quigley's Sticky-Ick-O-Rama machine!). The Word Whammer machine shows children how to put the consonants and vowels together, and how they sound.

Talking Letters taught recognition of each letter and the sound it makes;  this DVD teaches how to put those sounds together to make simple 3 letter words.My son was roughly 2.5 when we bought this, and he quickly learned to read 3 letter words.  When my daughter's friends came over, my daughter liked to spell words with letter tiles and have him read them to the genuine amazement of her playmates.Of course, if you want your child to fluently read a variety of books, it will take more than this Leapfrog series of DVDS (to date there are 4 reading ones and 1 math one).  However, this dvd UNQUESTIONABLY gives kids a head start.  It makes the material fun to learn and easy to remember, and who can quibble with that??I have also recommended this series to several friends whose kindergarteners were having trouble with letter/sound recognition and the idea of blending letters to make words.  The dvds helped all of their children make significant progress towards mastery of these concepts.I will warn adults that, while certainly not on a par with Teletubbies or Boo-bah, the DVD can be annoying, with its high pitched cutsie voices, bland graphics, big-eyed frogs, and silly songs. But kids, particularly toddlers, don't see it that way.This series, and this dvd in particular, is a great guilt-free way to grab 30 minutes to fold laundry or get dinner on the table.",5,Really Works!!!,1136764800,"01 9, 2006",2006,1492,"['so', 'much', 'success', 'Talking', 'Letters', 'Leapfrog', 'went', 'ahead', 'bought', 'one', 'were', 'just', 'pleased', 'Talking', 'Letters', 'taught', 'recognition', 'letter', 'sound', 'DVD', 'how', 'put', 'sounds', 'together', 'make', 'simple', '3', 'letter', 'words.My', 'son', 'was', 'roughly', '2.5', 'when', 'bought', 'quickly', 'learned', 'read', '3', 'letter', 'words', 'When', 'daughter', 'friends', 'came', 'over', 'daughter', 'liked', 'spell', 'words', 'letter', 'tiles', 'have', 'read', 'genuine', 'amazement', 'playmates.Of', 'course', 'want', 'child', 'fluently', 'read', 'variety', 'books', 'will', 'take', 'more', 'Leapfrog', 'series', 'DVDS', 'date', 'are', '4', 'reading', 'ones', '1', 'math', 'one', 'However', 'dvd', 'UNQUESTIONABLY', 'kids', 'head', 'start', 'material', 'fun', 'learn', 'easy', 'remember', 'who', 'can', 'quibble', 'have', 'also', 'recommended', 'series', 'several', 'friends', 'kindergarteners', 'were', 'having', 'trouble', 'letter/sound', 'recognition', 'idea', 'blending', 'letters', 'make', 'words', 'dvds', 'helped', 'children', 'make', 'significant', 'progress', 'towards', 'mastery', 'concepts.I', 'will', 'warn', 'adults', 'certainly', 'not', 'par', 'Teletubbies', 'Boo-bah', 'DVD', 'can', 'be', 'annoying', 'high', 'pitched', 'cutsie', 'voices', 'bland', 'graphics', 'big-eyed', 'frogs', 'silly', 'songs', 'kids', 'particularly', 'toddlers', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'way.This', 'series', 'dvd', 'particular', 'great', 'guilt-free', 'way', 'grab', '30', 'minutes', 'fold', 'laundry', 'get', 'dinner', 'table']",LeapFrog: Talking Words Factory

My 2-yr-old is beginning to get the ""concept"" of reading.  The idea that letters=words=meaning isn't something a 2-yr-old is presented in every-day life.  This DVD gives toddlers the opportunity to grasp this concept (if it interests them) while having fun (if they're not ready to grasp it, they'll just have fun).2. I'm sure that over the next year or so my toddler will return to this DVD and be VERY excited about his ability to understand it on a new level.  Best of all, he will have reached this new understanding ""all by himself"", the most authentic, inspiring way of learning.3. I enjoy watching it with him from time to time.

I didn't purchase this for myself, since I figured that the same title meant the same video.  I did purchase these for friends with preschool age children. As an early childhood and later an elementary school teacher, I have taught many children how to read.  I have also seen many different videos, books, and other materials meant to aid children in the process that learning to read is.  I have to admit that this video series is simply one of the best phonics learning aids I have encountered in all my years teaching.  I recommend these to parents all the time.  These videos are the very best products ever produced by LeapFrog, and that is saying something since many of their toys are good.  The videos are 30 minutes long and targest basic phonics skills that children must master in order to learn how to read.  The running time for these movies is perfect considering the attention span of the children it targets.  The songs used are catchy, and the story lines are fun for most kids. The crowning jewels of the series are the first three phonics videos.The Letter Factory teaches children the names and sounds of all the letters in the alphabet.  The vowels are only given their short sounds at this point, but that is ok for this level of learning.The Talking Words Factory teaches children how to put letters and their sounds together to make simple words, mostly with the consonant-vowel-consonant pattern and a few consonant blends.The Word Caper movie goes on to introduce silent E, long vowel sounds, and vowel-vowel combinations.The Math Circus video from this series is also good for children learning their numbers and basic addition/subtraction.Are these videos enough to teach a child to read?  No.  Will they help a child learn concepts faster and easier? Yes.  Is it a good resource for parents who want to help their children have a head start in their reading instruction or who want to help their children who are struggling with basic phonics?  Definitely.Learning phonics skills early and well is essential for pre-school and school age children.  When a child struggles it must be addressed immediately, otherwise reading gets harder each grade level and students fall further behind until catching up is almost impossible.  These videos help to set a good foundation for children.  Watching the movies with their children and asking them questions based on the videos can also help parents know what their child should be learning and if they are struggling with these skills.This video series is highly recommended.PS  REMEMBER - Look at the title of the movies before purchasing.  This is the re-release of the older video series (You don't mess with a great thing!)  If you have the older DVD's in good working order, then you don't need these titles.  LeapFrog has released some newer videos which you might be interested in.  None are better than these originals though and they do not target the same skills.",5,Outstanding Phonics Video Series,1272326400,"04 27, 2010",2010,3012,"['Let', 'begin', 'saying', 'have', 'old', 'Leap', 'Frog', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'purchase', 'figured', 'same', 'title', 'meant', 'same', 'video', 'did', 'purchase', 'friends', 'preschool', 'age', 'children', 'early', 'childhood', 'later', 'elementary', 'school', 'teacher', 'have', 'taught', 'many', 'children', 'how', 'read', 'have', 'also', 'seen', 'many', 'different', 'videos', 'books', 'other', 'materials', 'meant', 'aid', 'children', 'process', 'learning', 'read', 'have', 'admit', 'video', 'series', 'simply', 'one', 'best', 'phonics', 'learning', 'aids', 'have', 'encountered', 'years', 'teaching', 'recommend', 'parents', 'time', 'videos', 'are', 'very', 'best', 'products', 'ever', 'produced', 'LeapFrog', 'saying', 'something', 'many', 'toys', 'are', 'good', 'videos', 'are', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'targest', 'basic', 'phonics', 'skills', 'children', 'must', 'master', 'order', 'learn', 'how', 'read', 'running', 'time', 'movies', 'perfect', 'considering', 'attention', 'span', 'children', 'songs', 'used', 'are', 'catchy', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'fun', 'most', 'kids', 'crowning', 'jewels', 'series', 'are', 'first', 'three', 'phonics', 'videos.The', 'Letter', 'Factory', 'children', 'names', 'sounds', 'letters', 'alphabet', 'vowels', 'are', 'only', 'given', 'short', 'sounds', 'point', 'ok', 'level', 'learning.The', 'Talking', 'Words', 'Factory', 'teaches', 'children', 'how', 'put', 'letters', 'sounds', 'together', 'make', 'simple', 'words', 'mostly', 'consonant-vowel-consonant', 'pattern', 'few', 'consonant', 'blends.The', 'Word', 'Caper', 'movie', 'introduce', 'silent', 'E', 'long', 'vowel', 'sounds', 'vowel-vowel', 'combinations.The', 'Math', 'Circus', 'video', 'series', 'also', 'good', 'children', 'learning', 'numbers', 'basic', 'addition/subtraction.Are', 'videos', 'enough', 'teach', 'child', 'read', 'Will', 'help', 'child', 'learn', 'concepts', 'faster', 'easier', 'Yes', 'good', 'resource', 'parents', 'who', 'want', 'help', 'children', 'have', 'head', 'start', 'reading', 'instruction', 'who', 'want', 'help', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'struggling', 'basic', 'phonics', 'Definitely.Learning', 'phonics', 'skills', 'early', 'well', 'essential', 'pre-school', 'school', 'age', 'children', 'When', 'child', 'must', 'be', 'addressed', 'immediately', 'otherwise', 'reading', 'harder', 'grade', 'level', 'students', 'fall', 'further', 'catching', 'up', 'almost', 'impossible', 'videos', 'help', 'set', 'good', 'foundation', 'children', 'Watching', 'movies', 'children', 'asking', 'questions', 'based', 'videos', 'can', 'also', 'help', 'parents', 'know', 'what', 'child', 'should', 'be', 'learning', 'are', 'struggling', 'skills.This', 'video', 'series', 'highly', 'recommended.PS', 'REMEMBER', 'Look', 'title', 'movies', 'purchasing', 're-release', 'older', 'video', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'mess', 'great', 'thing', 'have', 'older', 'DVD', 'good', 'working', 'order', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'titles', 'LeapFrog', 'released', 'newer', 'videos', 'might', 'be', 'interested', 'None', 'are', 'better', 'originals', 'do', 'not', 'target', 'same', 'skills']",LeapFrog: Talking Words Factory

781896,AGFW667QNHDOY,B0000INU6I,S. Lipson,"[70, 84]","My kids love this tape! I'm pleased with it's educational value. However, I think kids (at this age) are going to need to watch it repeatedly before much of the content sinks in. The whole word factory theme reminded me of Willy Wonkas' chocolate factory minus the fun realism. This cartoon is typical of Saturday morning cheesy animation. My kids certainly don't seem to care in the least. The story line focuses on Tad wanting to fill out a form to nominate his Dad as the best and he needs to learn how to spell the words he wishes to put on his form. The words that are covered are almost all basic and ryhming three letter ones. Words ending in ""at"", ""in"", ""ig"", ""an"", and ""ad"". Also, ""st"" is illustrated in ""stop"" and then in ""best"". Vowels are named and described as ""sticky"" letters which are the ""glue"" to hold other letters together to make words. I'm disappointed in the shallow and ""un""-catchy jingles throughout the story line. A few well written lyrics with catchy jingles could have made this tape so much more enjoyable and memorable. My kids strong interest in this tape did make me go buy The Letter Factory. I like that these tapes are only 35 minutes long, it helps with (time) limit setting for TV viewing.",4,A hit with my 3 &4 yr olds.,1071273600,"12 13, 2003",2003,1227,"['kids', 'love', 'tape', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'educational', 'value', 'However', 'think', 'kids', 'age', 'are', 'going', 'need', 'watch', 'repeatedly', 'before', 'much', 'content', 'sinks', 'whole', 'word', 'factory', 'theme', 'reminded', 'Willy', 'Wonkas', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'fun', 'realism', 'cartoon', 'typical', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cheesy', 'animation', 'kids', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'least', 'story', 'line', 'Tad', 'wanting', 'fill', 'out', 'form', 'nominate', 'Dad', 'best', 'learn', 'how', 'spell', 'words', 'put', 'form', 'words', 'are', 'covered', 'are', 'almost', 'basic', 'ryhming', 'three', 'letter', 'ones', 'Words', 'ending', 'ig', 'ad', 'Also', 'st', 'illustrated', 'stop', 'then', 'best', 'Vowels', 'are', 'named', 'described', 'sticky', 'letters', 'are', 'glue', 'hold', 'other', 'letters', 'together', 'make', 'words', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'shallow', 'un', '-catchy', 'jingles', 'story', 'line', 'few', 'well', 'written', 'lyrics', 'catchy', 'jingles', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'tape', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'memorable', 'kids', 'strong', 'interest', 'tape', 'did', 'make', 'go', 'buy', 'Letter', 'Factory', 'like', 'tapes', 'are', 'only', '35', 'minutes', 'long', 'time', 'limit', 'setting', 'TV', 'viewing']",LeapFrog: Talking Words Factory
