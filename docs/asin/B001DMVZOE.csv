It helped that season 6 was lame, so that missing my favorite hero wasn't as painful as there was certainly a reluctance to see the 24 team fall even further in season 7.With 24: Redemption there's no doubt that the pre-s6 24 and the beloved Jack Bauer is back. He is a changed man. Not a man who's been redeemed, but a man who has had an incredibly hard time outrunning his past and his future. He is rough on his training and can no longer kill 50 men single-handedly. He still aims, shoots, ad hits more than 9 out of 10 times, but he is clearly showing his age and the wear and tear on his morality.When JB screams, ""You leave me no choice!"" you know we have no choice but to watch and wait for two more months with excitement and anticipation.

1182147,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001DMVZOE,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 3]","It has been two years since we have seen the likes of Jack Bauer and with the highly anticipated season 7 of the popular FOX drama ""24' coming back on FOX in Jan. 2009, what better than to kick the new season off with a two-hour special.The question of what has happened to Jack Bauer after the events of Season 6 is answered in this special.""24: Redemption"" is just an awesome two-hour special that features great storytelling, beautiful scenery but also a lot of action.This has to be unprecedented for a TV drama to film in another country but also including the Africans in the actual special as actors (and you can learn much more through the director's commentary on the DVD).As always, Kiefer Sutherland is always impressive as Jack Bauer and great performances throughout the board.  The African children did a great job in their roles and I give credit to the ""24 staff for bringing in actor John Voight to play the role as the corrupted person in the government.As mentioned, the cinematography capturing the scenery was just great.  The staff managed to capture the beauty and danger of Africa despite the many challenges faced during the shooting schedule.  I was truly impressed.The storyline was just engaging, action-packed and thrilling from start to finish.  Needless to say, I can't wait for Season 7.As for the DVD, the DVD features two versions of ""Redemption"".  The broadcast version and the extended version which has over 10 minutes of extra footage).  The extra footage are mainly dialogue between the incoming President and outgoing President and scenes that primary taking place in Washington.  You can learn more about the additional scenes from the actual commentary.VIDEO & AUDIO:""24: Redemption"" is featured in widescreen 1:78:1.  The picture quality is vibrant..  Especially when you see the differences of the Africa and the US scenes.  Africa is featured in amber/Earthy hues and looks beautiful.  While the US has a colorful but a different sense color which leans more towards dark bluish hues.  Video quality looked vibrant and colorful.As for audio, the show is featured in Digital 5.1 Dolby Surround.  Really good audio quality during the fighting sequences in Africa.  Otherwise, the special features mostly dialogue and the dialogue can be heard quite clearly.SPECIAL FEATURES:I admit that I was happy to see quite a few specials included on the DVD.  Special features are:* The Making of 24: Redemption Featurette - This featurette is about 20 minutes long and is actually very good.  Especially if you are a filmmaker.  Director Jon Cassar, writer Howard Gordon and staff are interviewed on how it was to film in Africa but the challenges that they faced.  I was surprised to see how the weather would change in an hour-time. They could be filming and then all of a sudden, they get high winds (up to 60mph), then rain and hail and then sunlight.  So, it was definitely a challenge for them to film but they managed to do it.  But also, an advantage to work with people in South Africa in developing certain mechanical systems for the terrain and also interviews with the African talent.* ""Blood Never Dry"": Child Soldiers in Africa Featurette - In this featurette, cast from the upcoming Season 7 would read a letter from a child soldier and also a featurette that tries to explain why children are being kidnapped and becoming soldiers.  And the trauma they go through and not wanting to go home because they have committed atrocity to so many innocent people that they are deeply burdened by it.  Also, how the militias get these children so addicted to drugs.  This was a very good featurette and truly an eye opener of what is currently going on in Africa.* Commentary by Executive Producer/Director Jon Cassar and Executive Producers Howard Gordon and Kiefer Sutherland - The commentary was also enjoyable to listen to.  From filming of the scenes to the three talking about various actors and actresses and their experience filming the special.  Also, this is probably how one would learn about scenes that are in the expanded version and are not shown on the broadcast.* 24 Season 6 in Four Minutes Featurette - For those who missed or forgot what Season 6 is about.  This featurette features what happened during that season in four minutes.* An Exclusive First Look at 24 Season 7 - I was very impressed by the first 15 minutes of the upcoming ""Day 7' episode of ""Season 7' which will start the ""24' series in Jan. 2009.  A lot of action and what I can I say... Tony Almeida.  It's starts off awesome and I craved for more!I have been watching the ""24' series since the first episode and have always been hooked on the series. But this special was one of the finest ""24' storylines and I'm glad to see that the staff went all out in filming this special.  Especially bringing the staff and filming it in Africa was just impressive. ""24' has always been a drama series that has long been admired because it has set the marker so high for a television drama series.As for this DVD, not only was it fun to watch but if you are a film student or a person that enjoys watching ""24: Redemption"", you'll have a blast on watching how the special was created but most of all certain elements of nature that the staff had to contend with.  Especially during the rain and making it look like sunlight and also the high winds that the staff had to block out during the recording.Also, a thumbs up for the staff including the featurette on child soldiers. This featurette was definitely an eye-opener and I was really surprised to hear the chilling words from those who soldiers who are in agony of the deaths they have caused and the permanent guilt they have to live with.And of course, that sneak peak to excite the ""24' fan for a month until the Season 7 begins.Overall, if you are a ""24' fan, this DVD has so much to offer.  You won't be disappointed!",5,Jack Bauer is back!!!!,1229126400,"12 13, 2008",2008,5895,"['been', 'two', 'years', 'have', 'seen', 'likes', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'season', '7',

The film takes place in real time format, just like all episodes do. After watching it, I am excited about upcoming season and I hope that 24 - Season 7 will be more like season 1 than season 6. Judging by the movie, ""24: Redemption"", there are many reasons for hope. The film is thrilling, gripping, it uses every one of its minutes effectively, and it is much more plausible with its plot and Jack's relations and intentions. It was a good idea to take Jack out of LA and place him in one of hot places on the planet, Sangala, the fictional country in Africa, with very real problems that look too familiar. Jack is back, and he is in great shape, still invincible, resourceful, the man of action who would not lose ability to think clearly and to make the right decision even when being brutally tortured. I am truly sorry that we may not see Robert Carlyle again - the chemistry between him and Sutherland was very real, and their last scene together moved me like not many scenes during all seasons did.

What would it be like if it wasn't set in Los Angeles, California?  Awesome is the answer to these questions.  Season 6 had me wavering as a 24 fan.  Granted I still think the character is great, but Season 6 was just plagued with bad writing!  Jack's dad was the cause behind the problems way too many times for it to be shocking by the end and it lost that edge of your seat action feel without the shocking conclusions.Anyway ""Redemption"" has Jack on the run, which is no secret to those who saw the end of last season.  Apparently he's already fled to a bunch of different places and we finally catch up with Jack in Africa.  It does sort of feel like a clich&eacute; rip off of the ""Blood Diamond"" story in some respects, but honestly they managed to keep me entertained well enough.  This really isn't a movie by any stretch of the imagination; this is more of a prequel to Season 7.  Which, judging by the way this ended, should be a very interesting season.  I won't really give much more than that away as the story is very intriguing and was as action packed as you'd expect from 24.With missing a whole year of 24, I think this prequel was a great idea in order to bring people up to speed with the next season and to give more depth to Jack's character.  The new setting with the war torn Africa was a pretty good choice in my opinion and definitely kept viewers on the edge of their seat, as 24 is supposed to do.

A very effective but violent special forces' agent, running away from the USA where he is wanted for many exploits of his, Jack Bauer is helping out a UN refugee camp for orphans in some difficult country in Africa, is there one that isn't? Then these children become the target of a rebel general who wants them in his army. He tries to kidnap them. Jack Bauer defends them. But the plot sickens at once with American politics. The first woman president has just been elected. The African country concerned is an ally of the US. The outgoing US president has financed, under the table of course, the rebellion against an official ally of the USA in order to create a problem for his successor. Is she really better? Who cares any way. She ends up with her inaugural speech that promises the American people, if they do what they have to do, their patriotic duty, that she will conserve and save democracy and freedom. Where? In hell I guess for the Africans that are sacrificed on the American political chessboard. We wonder after a while who can be interested in seven or eight or maybe twenty if they can seasons of this never ending series that is the most anti-American and anti-humane series I know.

1182175,A3LGFYDVKLICY8,B001DMVZOE,John Morgan,"[33, 46]","Let me start by saying that I love ""24."" I love each season for its own particular strengths. I even loved Season 6, with all of its flaws. But as for ""24: Redemption,"" I can only say that it's...OK. Granted, the producers had a pretty big hurdle to overcome from the outset, with 18 months of anticipation having built up. But the movie was operating under so many constraints that it never developed any of the depth that makes the series more than just an action show. It was as if the producers were expecting us to be so wowed by the exotic African and DC locations that we wouldn't notice that the story was weak. Having Jack trying to rescue a group of poor, oppressed African children was not only stereotypical, but it tried to play on the sympathies of the audience in the most blatant manner imaginable. Having the child soldier pointing a rifle at Jack while repeating ""Kill the cockaroach"" over and over, before running away in terror at the supposed power of Jack's words, gets my vote as probably the worst moment ever in any episode of ""24."" And, of course, they managed to cram in the obligatory torture scene from which Jack immediately recovers without missing a beat. I think the main problem was that they tried to give us two storylines in only two hours. They usually have 24 hours in which to develop a story. As a result, neither plot-line really ever went any place interesting. If the makers of ""24"" ever return to their idea of making a ""24"" feature film, they really need to learn some lessons from this experiment, because for me it proved that ""24"" can't work in a two-hour format without some serious overhaul. After all, everyone knows that Jack and company (except for those who get offed) are eventually going to stop the terrorists, before the season even starts. It's the little moments that make ""24"" great for me. I love it when Mandy the assassin is reduced to tears by the death of her girlfriend, while she stands in the crosshairs, in the first season. I love the conversation that Senator Palmer has with the two vandals who break his windows in Season 1. I love Palmer's impeachment in season 2, and the pained look on Mike Novick's face throughout. I love the final moments between Jack and Chappelle in season three. I love Michelle's farewell to Gael, also in season three (probably my favorite season). I love it when Jack robs the convenience store in season four. I love the look on Lynn McGill's face as he helplessly watches a fellow CTU agent die, in season five. And I love it when Assad says ""You've taken the wrong path, Shaheed"" as he kills the friend who betrayed him in season six. These are the kinds of moments you lose when you have to strip everything down to two hours, and for me, ""Redemption"" showed that the action and intrigue alone aren't enough to make it stand out from the plethora of similar shows and movies. I'll leave my critique at that. I'm sure that other diehard ""24"" fans will end up buying the DVD, anyway, but for those who are new to ""24,"" I'll just say that this is not the best starting point. Stick to the series.

1182194,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B001DMVZOE,Mark Baker,"[2, 4]","In the last year, Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) has seen the world.  No, he's not on vacation; he's running from a subpoena calling him to testify before Congress about his use of torture over the years.Most recently, he's landed in the African country of Sengala where he's helping a friend named Carl Benton (Robert Carlyle) with his school for orphaned boys.  When the subpoena catches up with him, Jack plans to move on.  But before he can, the rebels make a play for the boys, planning to force them into becoming soldiers in their bid to over throw the government.Meanwhile, back in the States, the first female President, Allison Taylor (Cherry Jones) is about to be sworn in.  While she clashes with outgoing President Daniels (Powers Boothe) over the situation in Sengala, her son is approached by a friend wanting help with a sticky situation at his job as a stock broker.What does that have to do with Jack's situation?  And can Jack get the boys to safety?This TV movie was created to bridge the gap between the disappointing sixth season and the delayed (due to the writer's strike) seventh season.  It does a good job of setting things in motion, but as such it feels incomplete to me.  Normally, the first episode of every season is slow as we catch up with our characters.  Here, that takes up too much of the time.  The happenings back in Washington DC were interesting, but they didn't seem to do anything but set up storylines for season seven.  And, in a show known for its twists, this movie was fairly predictable.  There was only one real twist.Now, being a 24 fan, I won't say I was completely disappointed.  The action here seemed better than what we got last season.  Jack also seems to be more on an even keel, which might help.  And I was certainly entertained the entire time.And for those wondering, outside of a brief prologue, the events do occur in real time.The threads set in motion here could be interesting once next season premiers.

1182200,ARMVAHWQQ9S8A,B001DMVZOE,"Pat Shand ""Pat Shand""","[7, 12]","It's been a long time coming.  Due to the Writer's Strike last year, the 24 team decided to hold off it's seventh season until the following year, in order to air a full, twenty-four episode season with no breaks on time.  It was probably a wise decision, but at a really bad time for the series.  The last we saw protagonist Jack Bauer and his ever changing cast of friends was in the sixth and by far the worst season of the series, so a lot of the fans were already on the fence.  The leaking of certain Season Seven spoilers made it seemed like 24 was delving even further into the cheesy soap opera plots that made up the sixth season.  Now, 24 returns with an original TV movie, a very hyped event that acts as a bridge between last season and the upcoming seventh season.  I was skeptical, for all the reasons listed above, but hoped the once brilliant team behind 24 would remind me how great that show used to be.  So what's the verdict?Eh.Not bad.  Certainly not good enough to win back whatever viewers they lost last season.  The story seems to be caught between ""unimportant prequel"" and ""standalone story,"" and that lack of focus is a bit overpowering.  Instead of focusing on Jack Bauer's redemption, which we fans were lead to believe would be the focus of the film, a lot of time is spent developing the political angle of the upcoming season, as well as developing a few bureaucratic villains that do little on screen but plot and twist their sizable mustaches.The stuff that did go on with Jack was okay.  The fight scenes weren't the best of 24, nor did the team go as far with the action OR character development as they should have in the first ever 24 TV movie, but there were a few impressive touches of character development.  The basic plot involves Jack helping an old friend with a school he's set up in Africa (specifically, the made-up nation of Sangala).  Things quickly get ugly when a team of rebels attacks the school, wishing the recruit the children into their army, forcing Jack to jump into action and save the kids.  This forces Jack to come out of hiding, and-in efforts to rescue the children-surrender himself to America, who he's been on the run from since the end of Season Six.  That'll be addressed in Season Seven, and I thought that part of the plot was really well done, as it worked well with the theme of the movie and also gave the next season a perfect launching point.A few other good bits were the relationship between Jack and one of the young children, Willy.  We got to see the soft side of Jack again, which is always nice.  Carl Benton, played by Robert Carlyle, was a great addition to the cast, and his performance as the teacher/hero of the students was particularly riveting.  I wish I had something good to say about any of the other plots going on outside of Sangala, but the political scenes were basically old hat for 24.  I recognize that, in doing a prequel for a season that has already been shot, there are really tight limits as to what you can do, but I feel like there was a lot of expectation that 24: Redemption just didn't meet.

1182212,A1DL0EDVWPSPEW,B001DMVZOE,"Ryan Matthews ""montvil""","[2, 5]","Let's be honest; a majority of us were holding our breath, recalling the note 24 left off on, remembering the strike and how long it's been since the last time Jack embarked on a mission to protect the greater good. '24: Redemption' was promoted as a movie that would connect Seasons 6 and 7 and lead us into a new era of the show.  For me, it turned out to be a lot more than that.This bridge had a back story I could relate to as well as any prior '24' theme. Many of us have been victimized by that empty feeling like we're unappreciated, that we have no one to turn to and that our life's purpose hasn't been fulfilled. You're immediately led to believe that this is what has brought Jack Bauer to Sangala, that he's emotionally broken and wandering from place to place searching for himself, searching for a way to escape his past, elude his government and find a new start. Just prior to his next move, he gets caught up in an aggressive pursuit for soldiers of a slave army designated to fight for a shift of power in Sangala.While the vintage '24' action at times is scarce, you still get your full dose in the few fight scenes. Jack takes on General Benjamin Juma's right hand man, Colonel Ike Dubaku, and their army in an effort to protect a school of children, including those of an old friend, from being recruited as soldiers. So what do we find out? You can't teach an old dog new tricks. Jack Bauer may be searching for peace, but he's still a trained killer and a man who fights to maintain world order.For me, the first sign that this wouldn't be a disappointment was when you found out it was still done in real time. Led to believe it was structured like an ordinary movie, I wondered how differently '24' would play out minus the clock. However, I was pleased to discover that this two hour event had all the bells and whistles that has made 24 riveting over the years, and hopefully more epic than ever in the coming seasons. This was a fantastic teaser and bridge from Seasons 6 to 7. What amazed me most about it was that aside from President Daniels and Tom Lennox, who we only met in Season 6, there were no old '24' characters. However, Jon Voight is sure to bring some fireworks to the show. I'm looking forward to the familiar faces of Chloe O'Brien and Kim Bauer among others come January. It should be a great year for the best show on TV.Grade: A-",5,Redemption: A Remarkable Bridge,1227571200,"11 25, 2008",2008,2378,"['Let', 'be', 'honest', 'majority', 'were', 'holding', 'breath', 'recalling', 'note', '24', 'left', 'off', 'remembering', 'strike', 'how', 'long', 'been', 'last', 'time', 'Jack', 'embarked', 'mission', 'protect', 'greater', 'good', ""'24"", 'Redemption', 'was', 'promoted', 'movie', 'would', 'connect', 'Seasons', '6', '7', 'lead', 'new', 'era', 'show', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'that.This', 'bridge', 'had', 'back', 'story', 'could', 'relate', 'as', 'well', 'prior', ""'24"", 'theme', 'Many', 'have', 'been', 'victimized', 'empty', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'unappreciated', 'have', 'one', 'turn', 'life', 'purpose', ""n't"", 'been', 'fulfilled', ""'re"", 'immediately', 'led', 'believe', 'brought', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'Sangala', 'emotionally', 'broken', 'wandering', 'place', 'place', 'searching', 'searching', 'way', 'escape', 'past', 'elude', 'government', 'find', 'new', 'start', 'Just', 'prior', 'next', 'move', 'caught', 'up', 'aggressive', 'pursuit', 'soldiers', 'slave', 'army', 'designated', 'fight', 'shift', 'power', 'Sangala.While', 'vintage', 'action', 'times', 'scarce', 'still', 'get', 'full', 'dose', 'few', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Jack', 'General', 'Benjamin', 'Juma', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'Colonel', 'Ike', 'Dubaku', 'army', 'effort', 'protect', 'school', 'children', 'including', 'old', 'friend', 'being', 'recruited', 'soldiers', 'So', 'what', 'do', 'find', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'teach', 'old', 'dog', 'new', 'tricks', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'may', 'be', 'searching', 'peace', 'still', 'trained', 'killer', 'man', 'who', 'maintain', 'world', 'first', 'sign', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointment', 'was', 'when', 'found', 'was', 'still', 'done', 'real', 'time', 'Led', 'believe', 'was', 'structured', 'ordinary', 'movie', 'wondered', 'how', 'differently', 'would', 'play', 'out', 'clock', 'However', 'was', 'pleased', 'discover', 'two', 'hour', 'event', 'had', 'bells', 'whistles', 'made', '24', 'riveting', 'years', 'hopefully', 'more', 'epic', 'ever', 'coming', 'seasons', 'was', 'fantastic', 'teaser', 'bridge', 'Seasons', '6', '7', 'What', 'amazed', 'most', 'was', 'aside', 'President', 'Daniels', 'Tom', 'Lennox', 'who', 'only', 'met', 'Season', '6', 'were', 'old', 'characters', 'However', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'sure', 'bring', 'fireworks', 'show', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'familiar', 'Chloe', ""O'Brien"", 'Kim', 'Bauer', 'others', 'come', 'January', 'should', 'be', 'great', 'year', 'best', 'show', 'TV.Grade', 'A-']",N/A

Unfortunately, although set in a two hour window of &#8220;real time&#8221;, Redemption lacks the familiar pulse pounding drive and excitement of the series, and is rather dull in comparison.After the conclusion of Day 5, Jack Bauer left America, and eventually ended up in the fictional African country of Sangala, staying with his friend Carl Benton (Robert Carlyle), a missionary running a school for young children.  When army forces engage in an operation to recruit the youths, Bauer and Benton attempt to lead the orphans to safety.Leading a group of young boys, through the African bush, doesn&#8217;t provide many opportunities for Bauer to engage in his usual heroics.  Bauer&#8217;s limitations are further emphasized, as he is completely without any outside help or technical support.  For those accustomed to the breakneck pace of the series, 24 Redemption is a very pedestrian slog, that ends on a particularly lackluster note.While Redemption introduces characters who will play key roles in Season Six, primarily President elect Allison Taylor (Cherry Jones), and General Juma (Tony Todd) of the Sangalan army, it probably isn&#8217;t essential viewing for other than hardcore fans, as the softer less effective Bauer featured here, isn&#8217;t the same larger than life superhero we are accustomed to seeing.",3,24 redemption lacks the intensity and drive of the series&#8230;,1398384000,"04 25, 2014",2014,1519,"['24', 'Redemption', '2008', 'two', 'hour', 'event', 'served', 'bridge', 'fifth', 'sixth', 'seasons', '24', 'dynamic', 'FOX', 'series', 'starring', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'former', 'CTU', 'agent', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'Unfortunately', 'set', 'two', 'hour', 'window', '8220', 'real', 'time', '8221', 'Redemption', 'familiar', 'pulse', 'pounding', 'drive', 'excitement', 'series', 'rather', 'dull', 'comparison.After', 'conclusion', 'Day', '5', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'left', 'America', 'eventually', 'ended', 'up', 'fictional', 'African', 'country', 'Sangala', 'staying', 'friend', 'Carl', 'Benton', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'missionary', 'running', 'school', 'young', 'children', 'When', 'army', 'forces', 'engage', 'operation', 'recruit', 'youths', 'Bauer', 'Benton', 'attempt', 'lead', 'orphans', 'safety.Leading', 'group', 'young', 'boys', 'African', 'bush', 'doesn', '8217', 'provide', 'many', 'opportunities', 'Bauer', 'engage', 'usual', 'heroics', 'Bauer', '8217', 's', 'limitations', 'are', 'further', 'emphasized', 'completely', 'outside', 'help', 'technical', 'support', 'accustomed', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'series', '24', 'Redemption', 'very', 'pedestrian', 'slog', 'particularly', 'lackluster', 'Redemption', 'introduces', 'characters', 'who', 'will', 'play', 'key', 'roles', 'Season', 'Six', 'primarily', 'President', 'elect', 'Allison', 'Taylor', 'Cherry', 'Jones', 'General', 'Juma', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'Sangalan', 'army', 'probably', 'isn', '8217', 'essential', 'viewing', 'other', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'softer', 'less', 'effective', 'Bauer', 'featured', 'here', 'isn', '8217', 'same', 'larger', 'life', 'superhero', 'are', 'accustomed', 'seeing']",N/A

1182230,AP3B615GM191G,B001DMVZOE,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 1]","To me, one of the real strengths of the TV series ""24"" has been the show's ability to weave romantic relationships into the complex plots, intense scenarios, and ""oh-my-gosh!"" cliffhangers.  Sure, fans love to see Jack Bauer get all intense and save the day, but when it comes right down to it, the Jack/Audrey, Tony/Michelle, Chloe/Edgar, and Karen/Bill (including others) relationships are really what drive forward the drama of any given season.This TV-movie, produced because of the TV Writers strike of 2007-2008, contains all the key elements (intensity, interesting plot, etc.) of ""24""'s past seasons minus that one crucial element: relationships.  Basically, the plot centers on Jack Bauer, now a sort of missionary in Africa, who is once again pulled into a political struggle when a group of revolutionist attempt a military coupe on the country he resides in.  At the same time, he is trying to keep himself one step ahead of the subpoena he is being served from the U.S. government for his previous interrogation techniques.While Jack's new ""line of work"" in Africa is much different than any previous character development, it falls flat simply because he is, by-and-large, alone (CTU doesn't even show up in the film) for the duration.  He's just as heroic and eccentric as ever, but it really doesn't builds towards anything besides a contrived method to lead into Season Seven.  In all honesty, I found the scenes involving the transition of power from President Noah Daniels to newcomer President-Elect Allison Taylor to be the most compelling of the entire two-hour period, as they really do set the groundwork for the upcoming season.Thus, although I realize that the ""24"" production crew was hamstrung by the writers strike and may have hit a bit of a writing roadblock as a result, I still found ""Redemption"" to be uninspiring and little more than a place holder between seasons six and seven.  Strangely, I like the implied direction that the show is taking heading into its seventh effort, but I just didn't enjoy this two-hour path to get there.  I'm ready to get back to the CTU-driven, Jack Bauer-intensive, relationship-driven drama I have come to expect and love from this program.",2,No Relationships = No True Drama,1243814400,"06 1, 2009",2009,2209,"['one', 'real', 'strengths', 'TV', 'series', '24', 'been', 'show', 'ability', 'weave', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'complex', 'plots', 'intense', 'scenarios', 'oh-my-gosh', 'cliffhangers', 'Sure', 'fans', 'love', 'see', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'get', 'intense', 'save', 'day', 'when', 'right', 'down', 'Jack/Audrey', 'Tony/Michelle', 'Chloe/Edgar', 'Karen/Bill', 'including', 'others', 'relationships', 'are', 'really', 'what', 'drive', 'forward', 'drama', 'given', 'season.This', 'TV-movie', 'produced', 'TV', 'Writers', 'strike', '2007-2008', 'key', 'elements', 'intensity', 'interesting', 'plot', 'etc', '24', 'past', 'seasons', 'one', 'crucial', 'element', 'relationships', 'Basically', 'plot', 'centers', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'now', 'sort', 'missionary', 'Africa', 'who', 'once', 'again', 'pulled', 'political', 'struggle', 'when', 'group', 'revolutionist', 'attempt', 'military', 'coupe', 'country', 'same', 'time', 'trying', 'keep', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'subpoena', 'being', 'served', 'U.S.', 'government', 'previous', 'interrogation', 'Jack', 'new', 'line', 'work', 'Africa', 'much', 'different', 'previous', 'character', 'development', 'flat', 'simply', 'by-and-large', 'alone', 'CTU', ""n't"", 'even', 'show', 'up', 'film', 'duration', 'just', 'heroic', 'eccentric', 'ever', 'really', ""n't"", 'builds', 'towards', 'anything', 'contrived', 'method', 'lead', 'Season', 'Seven', 'honesty', 'found', 'scenes', 'involving', 'transition', 'power', 'President', 'Noah', 'Daniels', 'newcomer', 'President-Elect', 'Allison', 'Taylor', 'be', 'most', 'compelling', 'entire', 'two-hour', 'period', 'really', 'do', 'set', 'groundwork', 'upcoming', 'season.Thus', 'realize', '24', 'production', 'crew', 'was', 'hamstrung', 'writers', 'strike', 'may', 'have', 'hit', 'bit', 'writing', 'roadblock', 'result', 'still', 'found', 'Redemption', 'be', 'uninspiring', 'little', 'more', 'place', 'holder', 'seasons', 'six', 'seven', 'Strangely', 'like', 'implied', 'direction', 'show', 'taking', 'heading', 'seventh', 'effort', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'two-hour', 'path', 'get', 'there', ""'m"", 'ready', 'get', 'back', 'CTU-driven', 'Jack', 'Bauer-intensive', 'relationship-driven', 'drama', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'love', 'program']",N/A
