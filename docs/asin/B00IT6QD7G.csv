1694864,A28JK8TWOMD3TX,B00IT6QD7G,Cindy M,"[8, 12]","My knowledge of the Tiny House concept is that it should not take almost a year to build the house, which it did take the main character of this documentary.  He seemed slow, undecided and basically uncommitted.  All of which he kinda-sorta acknowledges, or his friends and family do.  But it made for a less-than-enjoyable DVD, as you basically wanted him to get on with it and get the darn house finished, or find someone who knew what they were doing to help him finish it, so you could see how the house lived, and what the experience of living in it was like, which got relegated to the final after-shot minutes of the DVD, after he FINALLY got it done.  So if you want to watch an excruciatingly slow building process-meets-psychological anguish of completing a tiny house, this is the one for you.  If you want to actually &#34;see&#34; how someone lives in a tiny house (which is what I wanted), then this is not your best choice.  I'm fascinated with the concept, have read several books and articles on the subject (so far they lost me at the idea of a composting toilet), and wanted a glimpse of what life was like living in a tiny house, not &#34;how long can it take to build a tiny house?&#34;  Other than the general subject matter not being what I wanted, the documentary itself was well done.",3,Lacking,1402358400,"06 10, 2014",2014,1309,"['knowledge', 'Tiny', 'House', 'concept', 'should', 'not', 'take', 'almost', 'year', 'build', 'house', 'did', 'take', 'main', 'character', 'documentary', 'seemed', 'slow', 'undecided', 'basically', 'uncommitted', 'acknowledges', 'friends', 'family', 'do', 'made', 'less-than-enjoyable', 'DVD', 'basically', 'wanted', 'get', 'get', 'darn', 'house', 'finished', 'find', 'someone', 'who', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'help', 'finish', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'house', 'lived', 'what', 'experience', 'living', 'was', 'got', 'relegated', 'final', 'after-shot', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'FINALLY', 'got', 'done', 'So', 'want', 'watch', 'excruciatingly', 'slow', 'building', 'process-meets-psychological', 'anguish', 'completing', 'tiny', 'house', 'one', 'want', 'actually', '34', 'see', '34', 'how', 'someone', 'tiny', 'house', 'what', 'wanted', 'then', 'not', 'best', 'choice', ""'m"", 'fascinated', 'concept', 'have', 'read', 'several', 'books', 'articles', 'subject', 'so', 'far', 'lost', 'idea', 'composting', 'toilet', 'wanted', 'glimpse', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'living', 'tiny', 'house', 'not', '34', 'how', 'long', 'can', 'take', 'build', 'tiny', 'house', '34', 'Other', 'general', 'subject', 'matter', 'not', 'being', 'what', 'wanted', 'documentary', 'was', 'well', 'done']",TINY: A Story About Living Small
1694865,A2BAAKZHSUGCDP,B00IT6QD7G,"Jill Clardy ""So many books, so little time....""","[0, 0]","While I can never imagine living in a &#34;tiny house&#34; I appreciate the spare and economical living style of those who choose to do so. This short documentary covers the story of Christopher Smith, who at nearly 30 years old, has little sense of place or home since he has moved so frequently during his youth in a military family. He buys a trailer bed and starts to build his tiny house in the backyard of someone in Colorado, and much of the documentary focuses on the process of building the house. Interspersed with his building process, we visit other tiny houses and meet their owners. Some people choose tiny house living out of economic necessity, but others choose this life style to simplify and hone their possessions to a bare minimum.The documentary drags on at times with long scenes of Christopher's building process, whereas I would have preferred to see more variations of tiny houses and their owners. I think this documentary has the bones of a longer piece that could focus on the tiny house movement. Here in the San Francisco Bay Area, where real estate is ridiculously expensive, we hear from time to time of people who are living in small homes. This is a perfect environment for people who want to live small but still enjoy everything the urban environment offers.",4,Tiny Houses and the People Who Live in Them - May be the Wave of the Future,1405036800,"07 11, 2014",2014,1295,"['can', 'never', 'imagine', 'living', '34', 'tiny', 'house', '34', 'appreciate', 'spare', 'economical', 'living', 'style', 'who', 'choose', 'do', 'so', 'short', 'documentary', 'story', 'Christopher', 'Smith', 'who', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'old', 'little', 'sense', 'place', 'home', 'moved', 'so', 'frequently', 'youth', 'military', 'family', 'trailer', 'bed', 'build', 'tiny', 'house', 'backyard', 'someone', 'Colorado', 'much', 'documentary', 'focuses', 'process', 'building', 'house', 'Interspersed', 'building', 'process', 'visit', 'other', 'tiny', 'houses', 'meet', 'owners', 'people', 'choose', 'tiny', 'house', 'living', 'economic', 'necessity', 'others', 'choose', 'life', 'style', 'simplify', 'hone', 'possessions', 'bare', 'minimum.The', 'documentary', 'drags', 'times', 'long', 'scenes', 'Christopher', 'building', 'process', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'see', 'more', 'variations', 'tiny', 'houses', 'owners', 'think', 'documentary', 'bones', 'longer', 'piece', 'could', 'focus', 'tiny', 'house', 'movement', 'Here', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Bay', 'Area', 'where', 'real', 'estate', 'ridiculously', 'expensive', 'hear', 'time', 'time', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'living', 'small', 'homes', 'perfect', 'environment', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'live', 'small', 'still', 'enjoy', 'everything', 'urban', 'environment', 'offers']",TINY: A Story About Living Small

1694867,A7DAL9PK7F4M1,B00IT6QD7G,"Paul Donovan ""Paul Donovan""","[6, 10]","Nine Things about the Movie &#8220;Tiny&#8221; [USA, 2014]1. Capitalizing on the &#8220;maker&#8221; movement and the &#8220;downsizing&#8221; movement, this is supposed to be a small documentary (it&#8217;s barely an hour long) on the recent popularity of building tiny houses, which are houses under 400 square feet. But it&#8217;s not really a documentary. It&#8217;s a home-brewed screed against consumerism. Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with that, but I was hoping for a more balanced and informative piece of filmmaking.2. The movie follows a guy named Chris as he buys a piece of land in the middle of nowhere in Colorado, and builds a tiny house on a trailer. Chris is assisted by his angst-ridden girlfriend, who stresses on what is the meaning of &#8220;home&#8221;, probably because she wants to move to New York City while her boyfriend is getting ready to leave the entire civilized world behind.3. Even though the movie is only lasts an hour, it&#8217;s about 30 minutes too long. It makes all of its points very quickly, and then repeats them over and over. This is why, in between watching scenes of Chris building his house like an HGTV special, we see lots of pictures of other tiny houses. Lots of pictures. Lots of them.4. The movie also interviews other &#8220;tiny housers&#8221; while they wax romantic about their life perspectives. They are earnest and friendly, but they come off sounding a little smug and pretentious. They give us nuggets of wisdom like:&#8220;The world gets a lot bigger when you&#8217;re living small.&#8221;&#8220;The whole world is now my living room.&#8221;&#8220;I wanted to be larger than the small person that I needed to be in my big house.&#8221;5. Very little discussion is given to the problems of tiny houses, such as storage, occupancy, and privacy. And only once does the movie acknowledge the elephant in the room: Chris admits that there&#8217;s a weird irony in what he&#8217;s doing. He loves open spaces, so he bought some and built a house on it. But if everyone did that, there would be no more open spaces left.6. I think it&#8217;s funny that one of the gurus of tiny housing lived for a decade in buildings of less than 100 square feet, but then broke down and bought a 500 square foot house to live in with his family. He has another tiny house in his backyard.7. One thing the movie never really touches on is the psychological makeup of these tiny housers. A lot of them are the crunchy granola types. But Chris literally wants to live on a 10 x 12 foot slab of wood hundreds of miles from other people. He&#8217;s determined to do it whether his girlfriend stays with him or not. That&#8217;s really interesting, but it&#8217;s never explored. Probably because it&#8217;s his girlfriend doing most of the filming.8. The movie tries to make you feel bad if you don&#8217;t want to be like these people, or if you are not in a position where you can do it (like if you have kids). And in case you don&#8217;t learn the lesson that tiny houses are a wonderful, natural state of being, the film ends with an aerial shot of Chris&#8217;s house surrounded by grass, trees, and a rainbow.9. This movie is mildly interesting, but a lot of it is nothing more than personal home movie footage, and doesn&#8217;t really explore the topic like I was hoping. Perhaps most critically, the movie backfired on me. While I was neutral on the topic before I saw this, now I find that the fad of tiny housing is kind of silly, creepy, and hypocritical.",2,"I give this movie a resounding ""meh"".",1403568000,"06 24, 2014",2014,3516,"['Nine', 'Things', 'Movie', '8220', 'Tiny', '8221', '[', 'USA', '2014', ']', '1', 'Capitalizing', '8220', 'maker', '8221', 'movement', '8220', 'downsizing', '8221', 'movement', 'supposed', 'be', 'small', 'documentary', '8217', 'barely', 'hour', 'long', 'recent', 'popularity', 'building', 'tiny', 'houses', 'are', 'houses', '400', 'square', 'feet', '8217', 'not', 'really', 'documentary', '8217', 's', 'home-brewed', 'screed', 'consumerism', 'Not', '8217', 'anything', 'wrong', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'balanced', 'informative', 'piece', 'filmmaking.2', 'movie', 'guy', 'named', 'Chris', 'piece', 'land', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'Colorado', 'tiny', 'house', 'trailer', 'Chris', 'assisted', 'angst-ridden', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'what', 'meaning', '8220', 'home', '8221', 'probably', 'move', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'boyfriend', 'getting', 'ready', 'leave', 'entire', 'civilized', 'world', 'behind.3', 'Even', 'movie', 'only', 'hour', '8217', 's', '30', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'points', 'very', 'quickly', 'then', 'repeats', 'over', 'over', 'why', 'watching', 'scenes', 'Chris', 'building', 'house', 'HGTV', 'special', 'see', 'lots', 'pictures', 'other', 'tiny', 'houses', 'Lots', 'pictures', 'Lots', 'them.4', 'movie', 'also', 'other', '8220', 'tiny', 'housers', '8221', 'wax', 'romantic', 'life', 'perspectives', 'are', 'earnest', 'friendly', 'come', 'off', 'sounding', 'little', 'smug', 'pretentious', 'give', 'nuggets', 'wisdom', '8220', 'world', 'lot', 'bigger', 'when', '8217', 're', 'living', 'small.', '8221', '8220', 'whole', 'world', 'now', 'living', 'room.', '8221', '8220', 'wanted', 'be', 'larger', 'small', 'person', 'needed', 'be', 'big', 'house.', '8221', '5', 'Very', 'little', 'discussion', 'given', 'problems', 'tiny', 'houses', 'such', 'storage', 'occupancy', 'privacy', 'only', 'once', 'movie', 'acknowledge', 'elephant', 'room', 'Chris', '8217', 's', 'weird', 'irony', 'what', '8217', 'doing', 'open', 'spaces', 'bought', 'built', 'house', 'everyone', 'did', 'would', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'open', 'spaces', 'left.6', 'think', '8217', 'funny', 'one', 'gurus', 'tiny', 'housing', 'lived', 'decade', 'buildings', 'less', '100', 'square', 'feet', 'then', 'broke', 'down', 'bought', '500', 'square', 'foot', 'house', 'live', 'family', 'tiny', 'house', 'backyard.7', 'One', 'thing', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'touches', 'psychological', 'makeup', 'tiny', 'housers', 'lot', 'are', 'crunchy', 'granola', 'types', 'Chris', 'literally', 'live', '10', 'x', '12', 'foot', 'slab', 'wood', 'hundreds', 'miles', 'other', 'people', '8217', 'determined', 'do', 'girlfriend', 'not', '8217', 'really', 'interesting', '8217', 'never', 'explored', 'Probably', '8217', 's', 'girlfriend', 'doing', 'most', 'filming.8', 'movie', 'make', 'feel', 'bad', 'don', '8217', 'want', 'be', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'position', 'where', 'can', 'do', 'have', 'kids', 'case', 'don', '8217', 'learn', 'lesson', 'tiny', 'houses', 'are', 'wonderful', 'natural', 'state', 'being', 'film', 'aerial', 'shot', 'Chris', '8217', 'house', 'surrounded', 'grass', 'trees', 'rainbow.9', 'movie', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'lot', 'nothing', 'more', 'personal', 'home', 'movie', 'footage', 'doesn', '8217', 'really', 'explore', 'topic', 'was', 'hoping', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'critically', 'movie', 'backfired', 'was', 'neutral', 'topic', 'saw', 'now', 'find', 'fad', 'tiny', 'housing', 'kind', 'silly', 'creepy', 'hypocritical']",TINY: A Story About Living Small
1694868,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B00IT6QD7G,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[9, 10]","This relatively short (62 minutes) documentary about the &#8220;tiny houses&#8221; movement (where people give up many of their possessions) and build their own houses of less than 500 square feet (even as small as under 500 square feet of footprint) has been playing film festivals around the country. When 30 year-old Christopher Smith decided to &#8220;downsize&#8221; his life and build a 300 square foot house on a five-acre plot of land he bought in Colorado, he and his girlfriend Merete Mueller decided to turn the year-long project into a film. Smith had some film experience and Mueller was a writer.  &#8220;Tiny&#8221; is the result. The two narrated the film and interviewed each other as well as paying visits to other &#8220;Tiny houses&#8221;. (Note that in most cases the sleeping areas were lofts reached by a ladder.). They also used a Kickstarter campaign to fund their project.  It&#8217;s an interesting concept &#8211; one that I was not aware of and I&#8217;m glad I watched this film. The scenery of the Colorado mountain site where Smith was building the house (on the back of a trailer, I might add) is gorgeous and the image on the DVD is beautiful.The bonus material more than doubles the running time of the film. There is a &#8220;making of&#8221; featurette and deleted scenes both of Smith and Mueller and some of the others who have built tiny houses. And then there is a nearly-30-minute segment with an interview at a film festival. Honestly, while I really enjoyed the film, I did get bored with some of the repetition in the bonus footage. But anyone interested in this concept will find it worthwhile. In fact the co-friendly cardboard case which holds the DVD has printed info on how to learn more about designing small spaces and downsizing.This is a film that will fly under the radar and I&#8217;m glad that the folks at First Run Features (who provided the screener) are giving it wider distribution.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm&#8220;Anything Phonographic&#8221;",4,A &#8220;tiny&#8221; documentary with &#8220;not so tiny&#8221; bonus features,1400889600,"05 24, 2014",2014,2047,"['relatively', 'short', '62', 'minutes', 'documentary', '8220', 'tiny', 'houses', '8221', 'movement', 'where', 'people', 'give', 'up', 'many', 'possessions', 'build', 'own', 'houses', 'less', '500', 'square', 'feet', 'even', 'as', 'small', '500', 'square', 'feet', 'footprint', 'been', 'playing', 'film', 'festivals', 'country', 'When', '30', 'year-old', 'Christopher', 'Smith', 'decided', '8220', 'downsize', '8221', 'life', 'build', '300', 'square', 'foot', 'house', 'five-acre', 'plot', 'land', 'bought', 'Colorado', 'girlfriend', 'Merete', 'Mueller', 'decided', 'turn', 'year-long', 'project', 'film', 'Smith', 'had', 'film', 'experience', 'Mueller', 'was', 'writer', '8220', 'Tiny', '8221', 'result', 'two', 'narrated', 'film', 'interviewed', 'other', 'as', 'well', 'paying', 'visits', 'other', '8220', 'Tiny', 'houses', '8221', 'Note', 'most', 'cases', 'sleeping', 'areas', 'were', 'lofts', 'reached', 'ladder.', 'also', 'used', 'Kickstarter', 'campaign', 'fund', 'project', '8217', 'interesting', 'concept', '8211', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'aware', '8217', 'glad', 'watched', 'film', 'scenery', 'Colorado', 'mountain', 'site', 'where', 'Smith', 'was', 'building', 'house', 'back', 'trailer', 'might', 'add', 'gorgeous', 'image', 'DVD', 'beautiful.The', 'bonus', 'material', 'more', 'running', 'time', 'film', '8220', 'making', '8221', 'featurette', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Smith', 'Mueller', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'built', 'tiny', 'houses', 'then', 'nearly-30-minute', 'segment', 'interview', 'film', 'festival', 'Honestly', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'did', 'get', 'bored', 'repetition', 'bonus', 'footage', 'anyone', 'interested', 'concept', 'will', 'find', 'worthwhile', 'fact', 'co-friendly', 'cardboard', 'case', 'DVD', 'printed', 'info', 'how', 'learn', 'more', 'designing', 'small', 'spaces', 'downsizing.This', 'film', 'will', 'fly', 'radar', '8217', 'glad', 'folks', 'First', 'Run', 'Features', 'who', 'provided', 'screener', 'are', 'giving', 'wider', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', '8220', 'Anything', 'Phonographic', '8221']",TINY: A Story About Living Small
