1272327,AUEKISN1YNHKQ,B002JVWQUU,Abbie,"[0, 0]","Very well written sitcom revolves around the Heck family from Orson Indiana, in the &#34;middle&#34; of the country. The Middle rings true with  characters and situations that most families with kids experience. Patricia Heaton is once again a strong female lead as Frankie Heck, a harried housewife and mother who also works selling cars at &#34;Orson's last remaining car dealership.&#34; Neil Flynn shines as the father, Mike Heck, who works at the local quarry and who thinks &#34;sports&#34; is the answer to many of the kids problems, especially Axl, who is a gifted athlete and youngest son Brick, who is totally obsessed with books and fonts. Brick has to attend special socialization classes with an assorted group of quirky kids like himself. The daughter Sue Heck is deftly played by Eden Sher. Sue is the eternal optimist, albeit a geeky one, who frequently spars with Axl. The supporting players are all  excellent in their roles as Heck neighbors, friends, and relatives. I like Season 1 &2 for the character of Bob, Frankie's friend and co-worker who longs to belong to a family like the Hecks and is perfectly played by Chris Kattan. Kattan is seen less and less in season 3 and is gone after the first episode in Season 4. There is no explanation why this happens, and after being fired from the dealership, we lose the great comedy delivered by Kattan and the rest of the supporting players in the Elhert car dealership. Seasons 4&5 are weaker without Kattan. A good show that is still enjoyable but that misses the chemisty found among all the cast in the first three seasons.",5,Pure joy,1397088000,"04 10, 2014",2014,1595,"['Very', 'well', 'written', 'sitcom', 'Heck', 'family', 'Orson', 'Indiana', '34', 'middle', '34', 'country', 'Middle', 'rings', 'true', 'characters', 'situations', 'most', 'families', 'kids', 'experience', 'Patricia', 'Heaton', 'once', 'again', 'strong', 'female', 'lead', 'Frankie', 'Heck', 'harried', 'housewife', 'mother', 'who', 'also', 'selling', 'cars', '34', 'Orson', 'last', 'remaining', 'car', 'dealership.', '34', 'Neil', 'Flynn', 'shines', 'father', 'Mike', 'Heck', 'who', 'local', 'quarry', 'who', 'thinks', '34', 'sports', '34', 'answer', 'many', 'kids', 'problems', 'especially', 'Axl', 'who', 'gifted', 'athlete', 'youngest', 'son', 'Brick', 'who', 'totally', 'obsessed', 'books', 'fonts', 'Brick', 'attend', 'special', 'socialization', 'classes', 'assorted', 'group', 'quirky', 'kids', 'daughter', 'Sue', 'Heck', 'deftly', 'played', 'Eden', 'Sher', 'Sue', 'eternal', 'optimist', 'geeky', 'one', 'who', 'frequently', 'Axl', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'excellent', 'roles', 'Heck', 'neighbors', 'friends', 'relatives', 'Season', '1', '2', 'character', 'Bob', 'Frankie', 'friend', 'co-worker', 'who', 'belong', 'family', 'Hecks', 'perfectly', 'played', 'Chris', 'Kattan', 'Kattan', 'seen', 'less', 'less', 'season', '3', 'gone', 'first', 'episode', 'Season', '4', 'explanation', 'why', 'being', 'fired', 'dealership', 'lose', 'great', 'comedy', 'delivered', 'Kattan', 'rest', 'supporting', 'players', 'Elhert', 'car', 'dealership', 'Seasons', '4', '5', 'are', 'weaker', 'Kattan', 'good', 'show', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'chemisty', 'found', 'cast', 'first', 'three', 'seasons']",N/A

Maybe it's because there's someone for anyone to associate with on the cast - the well-meaning but severely overworked and stressed mom, the hardworking and largely clueless yet effective dad, the egocentric HS aged son, the socially invisible JHS daughter who tries her hardest to be include by trying out for everything, but making nothing, and the brilliant, yet socially challenged elementary aged younger son who proves again and again that the act of giving someone a cool name, ""Brick"" in this case, does not guarantee that they will be at all cool.I had the brilliant idea of giving Seasons 1 and 2 of The Middle to my wife for Valentine's earlier this year... and it was a solid gold hit!  My wife was thrilled nearly beyond words, and her friends were deeply jealous that all they got was a card and flowers.  Take that other husbands!  Ha!  Anyway, this show is a total hit at our house.  In fact, whenever we can we load up our dinner, haul it over by the TV and watch an episode...just one per evening...of The Middle while we eat.  My wife rations the episodes out so they last longer...so we can savor them and look forward to them.Just in case you don't know about The Middle - it's a show about the most average family you can imagine living the most ordinary life you can imagine in the most ordinary place you can imagine.  Frankei and Mike, the parents, struggle to make ends meet, Axl, the HS-age jock son, plays the teenager role brilliantly, usually painfully so, Sue is the sweet forgotten middle child who is self-sufficient and self-reliant, and Brick is the youngest, a child who loves NOTHING more than books and reading...to the exclusion of the world around him.5 stars...and may the series run as long as the magic is there.",5,A super-fantastic TV show...we hope they keep rolling them out as long as they can,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,1901,"['Everyone', 'family', 'LOVED', 'Middle', 'as', 'soon', 'saw', 'Maybe', 'lived', 'Indiana', '10', 'years', 'setting', 'show', 'someone', 'anyone', 'associate', 'cast', 'well-meaning', 'severely', 'overworked', 'stressed', 'mom', 'hardworking', 'largely', 'clueless', 'yet', 'effective', 'dad', 'egocentric', 'HS', 'aged', 'son', 'socially', 'invisible', 'JHS', 'daughter', 'who', 'hardest', 'be', 'include', 'trying', 'out', 'everything', 'making', 'nothing', 'brilliant', 'yet', 'socially', 'challenged', 'elementary', 'aged', 'younger', 'son', 'who', 'again', 'again', 'act', 'giving', 'someone', 'cool', 'name', 'Brick', 'case', 'not', 'guarantee', 'will', 'be', 'cool.I', 'had', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'giving', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'Middle', 'wife', 'Valentine', 'earlier', 'year', 'was', 'solid', 'gold', 'hit', 'wife', 'was', 'thrilled', 'nearly', 'words', 'friends', 'were', 'deeply', 'jealous', 'got', 'was', 'card', 'flowers', 'Take', 'other', 'husbands', 'Ha', 'Anyway', 'show', 'total', 'hit', 'house', 'fact', 'can', 'load', 'up', 'dinner', 'haul', 'over', 'TV', 'watch', 'episode', 'just', 'one', 'evening', 'Middle', 'eat', 'wife', 'episodes', 'out', 'so', 'last', 'longer', 'so', 'can', 'savor', 'look', 'forward', 'them.Just', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Middle', 'show', 'most', 'average', 'family', 'can', 'imagine', 'living', 'most', 'ordinary', 'life', 'can', 'imagine', 'most', 'ordinary', 'place', 'can', 'imagine', 'Frankei', 'Mike', 'parents', 'struggle', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'Axl', 'HS-age', 'jock', 'son', 'teenager', 'role', 'brilliantly', 'usually', 'painfully', 'so', 'Sue', 'sweet', 'forgotten', 'middle', 'child', 'who', 'self-sufficient', 'self-reliant', 'Brick', 'youngest', 'child', 'who', 'NOTHING', 'more', 'books', 'reading', 'exclusion', 'world', 'him.5', 'stars', 'may', 'series', 'run', 'as', 'long', 'magic', 'there']",N/A

The show sounded interesting and I had always loved Patricia Heaton inEverybody Loves Raymond: The Complete Series, so I had to find this little advertised show and give it a watch.It was LOVE at first sight!

Unlike ""Rosanne"" which is parent-centric, the Middle has a perfect balance between adult/parenting perspective and child/being parented perspective. Parenting, even mediocre parenting is really, really hard and at times seemingly impossible. And being under the control and restrictions of parents, even ones who love you and take care of your needs, is annoying and often infuriating.I love in this show how the kids are front and center, not tucked away to appear only when convenient to the storyline. There is no getting away from them. And how the parents are fallible human beings who make mistakes, lots of them. This show hits the mark again and again on stuff that we've done, said, or has happened in our household, and it's quite therapeutic to know we are not alone.The characters and acting are exceptional, the writers are insightful and never seems to run out of material, and the delivery is hilarious. The chemistry between the five main characters (and several minor characters) is great. I love how each episode stands on its own but weaves in plots and happenings from previous shows. There are also cameos of very famous actors playing out of character, e.g., in seasons 1&2 Betty White plays the cruel librarian and Brooke Shields the unkempt white-trashy neighbor hahahaha.As a major bonus I and my almost 16 year old now have ""our show.""

I just received the DVD of season one and have almost finished the entire season laughing my head off with a big smile on my face the entire time. Not to pit this against other shows but it seems this show has been overshadowed by that other family show that airs on the same night--but this one is sooooo much better!

I bought into the hype and watched that show week after week and waited for the laughs that never came. With all due apologies to the fans of that show, it has never made me laugh once. It tries hard. Maybe too hard and that is the problem.About the same time, The Middle arrived and it was not exactly considered 'must see' tv, so I never watched until this week. I downloaded a few episodes and loved them so much I had to buy the entire first season. It is utterly brilliant how funny this show is. The cast is terrific and they turn everyday events into moments of hilarity that few shows have ever attained. I am not exaggerating when I say there are more genuine laugh out loud moments in the pilot than I experienced in the entire first season of Modern Family. But The Middle is not politically correct and that is why it not getting all the attention.And the moments of family bonding work because they arrive unexpectedly and not overly done. It reminds me in a way of MASH and how they used comedy so wonderfully and then tossed in a moment of great drama.And I have to give special mention to Eden Sher, who plays Sue Heck. She pulls off an amazing trick in creating someone who is wholly original in just about every way. Some will draw comparisons to Blossom from NBC many years ago but no. They may have a resemblance physically but Eden is far superior as a comedic actress.I don't follow the Emmys so I was shocked when I looked and it has not even been nominated but Modern Family has won a few times? Crazy.If you want a series that will make you laugh, smile and just feel good, this is it. It towers over the likes of Modern Family.Ten years from now, Modern Family will be one of those series that has all the hardware but will be mostly forgotten(a lot of 'successful' series are that way) but this series, The Middle, will become like Arrested Development, a show not appreciated in its own time, both brilliant comedies for the ages.",5,Towers Over Modern Family,1323302400,"12 8, 2011",2011,2058,"['few', 'years', 'ago', 'Modern', 'Family', 'garnered', 'attention', 'next', 'great', 'American', 'family', 'comedy', 'bought', 'hype', 'watched', 'show', 'week', 'week', 'waited', 'laughs', 'never', 'came', 'due', 'apologies', 'fans', 'show', 'never', 'made', 'laugh', 'once', 'hard', 'Maybe', 'too', 'hard', 'problem.About', 'same', 'time', 'Middle', 'arrived', 'was', 'not', 'exactly', 'considered', ""'must"", 'see', 'tv', 'never', 'watched', 'week', 'downloaded', 'few', 'episodes', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'had', 'buy', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'utterly', 'brilliant', 'how', 'funny', 'show', 'cast', 'terrific', 'turn', 'everyday', 'events', 'moments', 'hilarity', 'few', 'shows', 'have', 'ever', 'attained', 'am', 'not', 'exaggerating', 'when', 'say', 'are', 'more', 'genuine', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moments', 'pilot', 'experienced', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'Modern', 'Family', 'Middle', 'not', 'politically', 'correct', 'why', 'not', 'getting', 'attention.And', 'moments', 'family', 'bonding', 'work', 'arrive', 'unexpectedly', 'not', 'overly', 'done', 'way', 'MASH', 'how', 'used', 'comedy', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'then', 'tossed', 'moment', 'great', 'drama.And', 'have', 'give', 'special', 'mention', 'Eden', 'Sher', 'who', 'Sue', 'Heck', 'amazing', 'trick', 'creating', 'someone', 'who', 'wholly', 'original', 'just', 'way', 'will', 'draw', 'comparisons', 'Blossom', 'NBC', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'may', 'have', 'resemblance', 'physically', 'Eden', 'far', 'superior', 'comedic', 'actress.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'Emmys', 'was', 'shocked', 'when', 'looked', 'not', 'even', 'been', 'nominated', 'Modern', 'Family', 'won', 'few', 'times', 'Crazy.If', 'want', 'series', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'smile', 'just', 'feel', 'good', 'likes', 'Modern', 'Family.Ten', 'years', 'now', 'Modern', 'Family', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'series', 'hardware', 'will', 'be', 'mostly', 'forgotten', 'lot', ""'successful"", 'series', 'are', 'way', 'series', 'Middle', 'will', 'become', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'show', 'not', 'appreciated', 'own', 'time', 'brilliant', 'comedies', 'ages']",N/A

It wasn't ELR nor even (the cancelled way too early) ""Back to You"".  It's different from Patricia Heaton's earlier shows, but makes up for the lack of fireworks with a subtle social undercurrent that runs through the episodic plot lines.  Never grating or in your face, you never forget that the Heck family is living the day to day struggle to hang onto a middle class lifestyle that is tragically slipping away from so many in the real world.The title itself is sly and descriptive meaning either middle class, middle age, mid-America or mid-point in Heaton's career depending on how one wants to interpret it.  The plot lines are a little predictable and bland, but  the cast, is more than up to the task of raising the scripts to a higher level than they deserve.  The kids are suitably nutty enough to endear them to viewers without their personalities reaching the cloyingly sweet level.  The quarry closing where ""hubby"" worked, the kids need to fit in and ""Frankie's"" daily grind of holding it all together present a charming and realistic sit-com that has great potential to become a staple for years to come.  My only reservations are some of the weaker scripts and whether or not this show will be allowed the time to ""blossom"".  If ABC has any brains left in it's corporate offices, they'll give it the time.UPDATE:  Fortunately ""The Middle"" has been given  time to mature and has taken on a ""Rosanne for the 21st century"" patina which wears pretty well as the ratings seem to be up.  ""Mike"" is back at work and they've dropped quite a bit of the social commentary and focused on the dysfunctional family story lines which is probably what network TV viewers want to see.  The two younger kids (""Brick""  and ""Sue"") have emerged as standouts and portray a comic reality not seen in sitcoms since the emergence of Bart Simpson and the Bundy kids 2 decades ago.

The writers have a dry sense of humor and sometimes the whole show will build to a single line that will make you laugh out loud.The little kid, Brick, is hysterical---but all the kids are.  The director just pulls out these performances that are incredible, never over the top.  I think it's sort of a shame that Modern Family follows this show because the sense of humor there is more in your face and the kids can be melodramatic.  Which is the exact opposite of The Middle.  The Middle's humor is so subtle and profound, it's possible to miss it if you aren't paying attention.The episode with the oldest son having to care for the baby is beyond hysterical--I think it's the funniest thing I have ever seen.  Beyond hysterical!  (not a spoiler)  When Brick says, ""Believe me, I know""---you will hoot, hoot, hoot.  Almost as funny is the one-liner in another episode when the mother talks about cleaning her gun for 29 minutes.The parents are OK on this show.  The mother has some of the best lines and sometimes her timing could be a lot better.  The dad sort of sounds like he has cotton in his mouth and did anyone bother to stand these two people next to each other during casting.  Apparently they realize this because the cover is completely fake---if you take the mother on the cover and move her head down to about three inches above his belt buckle, that's what they REALLY look like side by side.

It's set in Orson, Indiana which is a fictional town where sitcom vets Patricia Heaton (Emmy Winner from Everybody Loves Raymond) plays Frances ""Frankie Heck. She should have earned a Best Actress in a Comedy series nomination at least but anyway she runs a household with Mike Heck (played by Scrubs' alum Neil Flynn) who is just perfect casting.Their children include teenage boy Axl (Charlie Dermott) who likes to take off his shirt too much, middle school Sue (Eden Shurr) who never gets respect or attention even in school but her spirit is strong, and there's the youngest son, Brick (Atticus Shaffer) who whispers to himself and reads a lot. Anyway, the show is rounded out by Frankie's workplace. She works at a car dealership with Chris Kattan who plays lonely single guy and her best friend.Sometimes we get great guest stars like Frances Bay who plays Aunt Ginnie (the actress is 90 years old in real life and she's still working.) She deserves kudos. I love the series and the show is funny without trying. The episodes are always unique and special. I wasn't a fan of Malcolm in the Middle or Everybody Loves Raymond or Scrubs but I'm a fan of this show. I think Patricia Heaton really shines as the head of this show's cast. Her character isn't perfect. No Frankie's far from it.The show is more entertaining than any others that night.

In The Middle, her talent really has a chance to shine.  She carries the lead amazingly and is the perfect person to do so.  Neil Flynn, who plays her husband on the show, is also the right actor for that part.  He delivers his lines in a funny, typical fatherly way!  Eden Sher, is the teenage daughter, but over-plays her part quite a bit.  Still, she comes across loveable and funny.  Charlie McDermott, the lazy teenage son, also tends to overact, but he, too, still makes you laugh.  And, of course, Atticus Shaffer, playing the youngest son, has a way of stealing your heart and making you want to see more of him.Whoever is responsible for casting does a marvelous job of selecting actors to play the additional characters in the episodes. Watching each one a second time around made me laugh twice as much, because I picked up funny lines I can't believe I missed the first time.
