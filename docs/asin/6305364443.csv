Rather, that was a component in a film -- one of my favorites -- that had a lot of other things going for it, like atmosphere, an intersting B-story featuring rival groups of antagonists, an interesting setting and, most importantly, the tension between Joan Wilder's romantic fictions and her romantic reality.With &quot;Jewel of the Nile,&quot; everything is gone except for the bickering. The most enjoyable villain is reformed (mostly), the setting is generic (and fairly insulting) Middle East, and the adventure features little of the fun that informed the first movie.Apparently, there's a script for a third movie floating around in Hollywood that's allegedly far superior to &quot;Jewel of the Nile,&quot; and there are people who are reportedly disappointed they couldn't ever make it, due to the lack of success this film had. I'm sorry, but &quot;Jewel of the Nile&quot; got what it deserved: It's a middle of the road remake to a film that really lucked into its breakout status to begin with.

Unfortunately familiarity has begun to breed, if not contempt, at least frustration, which isn't helped by the fact that Joan is suffering severe writer's block; apparently living a romance isn't conducive to writing one.  When a flamboyant Arab (Spiros Focas) invites her to write his biography, she leaps at the chance--not only is he attractive, but she thinks it may be time for her to move on to more serious efforts.  But Omar turns out not to be what she thinks, and Jack, joined by their rather inept nemesis Ralph (Danny DeVito) from Colombia, sets out to rescue her.  Meanwhile Joan has discovered that the ""jewel of the Nile"" that everyone (including Ralph and, to an extent, Jack) is looking for is in fact a desert holy man (Avner Eisenberg) who is also a prisoner of Omar's, and the two of them have contrived an escape.

461464,A2W3QN3Q2BGFSG,6305364443,G.F. Snell III,"[8, 12]","I had forgotten about the movie ""Jewel of the Nile"" (1985) until I attended a small performing arts theater tucked into the wilderness of the Lake Region of Maine. There - in a theater that looked more like a barn than a stage -- I caught the rather amusing one-man show of Avner Eisenberg.He did physical comedy, mostly complicated pratfalls. While perusing his biography in the program, I found this nugget: Eisenberg appeared in ""The Jewel of the Nile"" as the jewel.What? I thought, is it even possible that I never watched the sequel to ""Romancing the Stone"" (1984)? But I had no memory of the movie -none. So when I got home, I rented it.And it all came back to me - like a horrible nightmare.""The Jewel of the Nile"" is proof that you can't always return to the well. Because sometimes the well water turns into putrid sewage and if you drink it: you will die.My first reaction was to track down Eisenberg and beat him with a rubber chicken.""Jewel"" is an epic disaster - a sequel so ill-thought out, poorly directed, horribly written, and featuring performances so lackluster one could argue that Michael Douglas wasn't even aware that he was in the movie. And I had seen it before - but had purged the memory from my brain.I actually turned it off, but the next night, I was drawn back to it like a moth to a candle. The movie was so damn bad that I couldn't help myself. It's unfortunate because ""Romancing the Stone"" was such an unexpected pleasure. It brought a refresh to the old-fashioned romantic adventure - with some laughs thrown in.What made ""Romancing the Stone"" a hit was the chemistry between Kathleen Turner's Joan Wilder and Douglas's Jack Colton. She was the repressed writer and he was the wild, roguish adventurer. The way the two actors played off each other made for a funny, delightful escape.However, the success led to the rushed making of the sequel the very next year.And sometimes speed kills.The biggest problem with ""Jewel"" is the writing. The script is so improbable that it borders on the ridiculous. We're supposed to believe that Wilder - a bestselling romance novelist - would agree to write a biography about a Middle Eastern dictator she knows absolutely nothing about (he turns out to be a deranged tyrant).Never mind the outrageous probability that said dictator, Prince Omar (played without irony by Spiros Focas), would even consider personally traveling halfway across the world to recruit a romance writer as his official biographer. The question viewers want answered is: ""Why?"" Unfortunately, there is no answer.Then there's an attempt at a plot where Eisenberg - playing an oafish, but lovable religious leader - must be killed by the dictator so he can become the ultimate ruler of this fictional Middle Eastern kingdom before Eisenberg can be. Who this ""Jewel"" is and how he became a powerful religious icon is never explained. In fact, we're not quite sure what religion we're even talking about.But forget all the plot holes and the lapses in reason that riddle the script. Hell, forget about the bloated budget and the unnecessary explosions and camel chases (but most of all forget about Danny DeVito, who delivers one of his worse performances ever).The real problem with ""Jewel"" is that Douglas and Turner spend the majority of the movie separated.Amazing, isn't it?But how can that be, one might ask. Wasn't the success of the first movie the tit-for-tat exchanges between the actors? Wasn't it the super-charged romantic chemistry that ignited the screen the first time?Apparently, the producers, director and writers forgot about that.Like most of the movies we feature in Fantastically Bad Cinema - ""The Jewel of the Nile"" has to be seen to be believed.

They are now in the Greek isles.  Jack loves their life of leisure living on their yacht, but Joan is getting board and is fighting a major case of writer's block.  In fact, she can't seem to finish her latest book, which is already overdue to the publisher.Things change when Joan gets an offer she thinks she can't refuse.  Omar (Spiros Focas) is about to become King of his country in Africa, and he is a fan of Joan's work.  He wants Joan to write his biography.  She is delighted and jumps at the chance, even though Jack isn't interested, and the two split.But things aren't as they seem.  Joan soon learns that Omar isn't all he pretended to be and she must write only what he approves.  Jack gets wind of the danger and set off to rescue her.  Can he find her?  Will they get away?  And what is this jewel that everyone is trying to find?Often time, sequels feel like retreads, going over the same ground as the original.  Here, the movie truly feels like a continuation of Romancing the Stone, putting familiar characters in a completely new situation.  I found the film just as funny, adventurous, and romantic as the first.It does have a big flaw, however.  Danny DeVito returns as Ralph, one of the bumbling bad guys from the first movie.  While he give another fine performance, I found his inclusion highly unlikely.  And his storyline went nowhere for most of the film as well.  I think the film would have been stronger if they had left him out.The first film had tons of foul language.  This one continues the trend, although it seemed to be toned down some here.  Still, parents will probably want to judge for themselves if it is appropriate for their child.While I enjoy most sequels I see, I do notice they often aren't as good.  This is a rare case where both films in the series are just as entertaining.

This time around, however the new screenwriter (that took over the reins from RTS' original screenwriter, Diane Thomas, who was now busy helping Steven Spielberg develop his romantic epic, Always) went for more of a core relationship between the two leads, Jack T. Colton (Michael Douglas) and Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner), with dismal consequences.  The romance that brought them together in RTS is largely gone, replaced now by a kind of boredom and disdain.  Jack still very much loves Joan, and, in male-establishment '80s form, wants her to follow his every lead as he sails around the world, but Joan, in feminist '80s form, wants out.  We'd see this kind of relationship, with equal disdain, later from our two leads when they played a husband and wife in The War of the Roses, but this is not the way I, and undoubtedly much of the public, wants to see them!  They're Tracy and Hepburn!  We like it when they were enchanted with each other, and in chasing the object of the quest.  Frankly, they're SEXIER in RTS.

My girlfriend and I went to see something special and it was sold out.  But we'd driven so far to this movie house we decided to see SOMETHING!  We looked at the marquee and saw Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner in a new film (Romancing the Stone) we hadn't even heard of, and decided to go for it.  Must I say that this was one of the very best action/romance adventures of recent decades?!  You betcha!  So it wasn't much of a thought process to go see it's sequel -- and we were happy to see the return of Danny DeVito as well!The amount of action was increased for this movie, maybe because shoot-'em-ups outperform romances -- who knows.  But it all worked out well, with another nasty villain, the Brothers Karamazov (who aren't really brothers) playing juggling Arabs, and a person (SPOILER ALERT!) that is indeed a jewel of a fellow!  Turner's naivet&eacute; about the chap she's doing a story on doesn't last long, but she is reluctant to mention her discovery of exactly what the Jewel of the Nile is to her lover (Douglas) who is still thinking of some treasure of a Jewel -- like in Romancing the Stone.Mainly it's one long chase -- with the bad guy pursuing them across the desert to prevent them telling the story of what he is up to -- but when was the last time you saw a chase that involved an F-16 Fighter Aircraft ---- on the ground?!  There are some interludes for Turner and Douglas along the way, but in the end there are two grand climaxes: defeating the bad guys plan and getting married!  End of sequels...  With the prices that Amazon is offering for these Blu-Ray discs it was not a hard decision for me to make -- get 'em both!!  Seldom does a pair of movies come along that make you laugh as much, and feel for the all the characters involved.  Oh yes -- you can give your older DVD versions of these movies to a friend who may not yet have caught the real jewel in movies today -- Blu-Ray!",5,"""Will you take American Express Traveler's Cheques?""",1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,2024,"['Jewel', 'Nile', 'was', 'great', 'followup', 'Romancing', 'Stone', 'movie', 'first', 'saw', 'accident', 'girlfriend', 'went', 'see', 'something', 'special', 'was', 'sold', 'out', ""'d"", 'driven', 'so', 'far', 'movie', 'house', 'decided', 'see', 'SOMETHING', 'looked', 'marquee', 'saw', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'new', 'film', 'Romancing', 'Stone', 'had', ""n't"", 'even', 'heard', 'decided', 'go', 'Must', 'say', 'was', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'action/romance', 'adventures', 'recent', 'decades', 'betcha', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'thought', 'process', 'go', 'see', 'sequel', 'were', 'happy', 'see', 'return', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'as', 'well', 'amount', 'action', 'was', 'increased', 'movie', 'maybe', ""shoot-'em-ups"", 'outperform', 'romances', 'who', 'worked', 'out', 'well', 'nasty', 'villain', 'Brothers', 'Karamazov', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'brothers', 'playing', 'juggling', 'Arabs', 'person', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'indeed', 'jewel', 'fellow', 'Turner', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'chap', 'doing', 'story', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'reluctant', 'mention', 'discovery', 'exactly', 'what', 'Jewel', 'Nile', 'lover', 'Douglas', 'who', 'still', 'thinking', 'treasure', 'Jewel', 'Romancing', 'Stone.Mainly', 'one', 'long', 'chase', 'bad', 'guy', 'pursuing', 'desert', 'prevent', 'telling', 'story', 'what', 'up', 'when', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'chase', 'involved', 'F-16', 'Fighter', 'Aircraft', 'ground', 'are', 'interludes', 'Turner', 'Douglas', 'way', 'end', 'are', 'two', 'grand', 'climaxes', 'defeating', 'bad', 'guys', 'plan', 'getting', 'married', 'End', 'sequels', 'prices', 'Amazon', 'offering', 'Blu-Ray', 'discs', 'was', 'not', 'hard', 'decision', 'make', 'get', ""'em"", 'Seldom', 'pair', 'movies', 'come', 'make', 'as', 'much', 'feel', 'characters', 'involved', 'Oh', 'yes', 'can', 'give', 'older', 'DVD', 'versions', 'movies', 'friend', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'yet', 'have', 'caught', 'real', 'jewel', 'movies', 'today', 'Blu-Ray']",N/A
