Frankly, I'm more Socialist than anything else, at least on many issues. Like many in the party, I was entirely inked that the Bush Bunch managed to steal the Florida elections. I kept referring to him as ""The Pretender-in-Chief"" for most of his first term.When the 2004 elections happened, they were messy and foul, but I assumed that at least, sucky though the results were from my point of view, Bush had won legitimately.Then I saw this film.Wow.You know, if even a small amount of what's presented in this movie is true, we have a major problem on our hands. I suspect a lot more than a small amount is true, which makes it even worse.Ultimately in our democracy we have to trust our elections, even if we can't trust anything else. Given how easy it appeared to be for the Finnish hacker to get into the system, and the comments from the Diebold executive about making sure Ohio would go for Bush, and a number of other things in the movie, I've come to the conclusion that we cannot trust our elections.One of my friends is a Republican. A gay, neo-conservative, ditto-head, knee-jerk Republican. Imagine Anne Coulter as a not-very-attractive man, and you're on the right track. I've tried to get him to watch this movie and he simply carps about how the Democrats only care about election fraud now that it's the Republicans doing it.I think he misses the point rather a bit.The movie is a little overpriced, but well worth the purchase by people of any party.

Practically every person that is approached for information or asked to investigate becomes defensive and obstructive. Even when it is obvious something is clearly wrong, the information is quickly hidden.The recount in the Ohio county was shown that the election officials had already selected the 3% to count and had already pre counted them.One senator states that to investigate would be to allow people to doubt the process. So, his answer is to ignore it.This is a must see dvd..  really, it truly will make you mad that this is allowed to happen in the US.One item that did stand out was the 2004 election and how John Kerry had a team of lawyers ready to challange the electronic voting results. He KNEW that fraud had been committed but instead conceded the election and stopped any challange.What the DVD lacks is conclusions in regards to the issues in Florida. They are allowed by law to gain certain information and it was not provided. There is no followup to gain this information. They they find the official receipts in the trash, which is against the law, and nothing is followed up on this.

1046775,AQ2UN38CMK119,B000MKXF28,P. Mann,"[12, 14]","Was George W. Bush ever legitimately elected president? The answer, according to many, is no. Whether they are correct, the fact that there is so much distrust in elections is a serious problem, even if the elections were completely legitimate. That legitimacy and the perception of illegitimacy are at the heart of ""Hacking Democracy"" and represent the consuming passion of Bev Harris, the center of the film and author ofBlack Box Voting: Ballot Tampering in the 21st Century. Harris, as the film shows, is obsessed with voting rights, especially when it comes to computer voting.This issue should be non-partisan. Americans should be concerned about the accuracy of the vote regardless of their party affiliation. Unfortunately, the film, perhaps for reasons of recent history, seems to portray Democrats as the victims of Republicans' machinations. In particular, the film suggests strongly that President George W. Bush's two elections were the result of voter[...], not of actual votes, first in Florida and then in New Mexico and Ohio. I suspect that today's highly polarized zeitgeist might lead those who lean right to dismiss the film while those who lean left to endorse it uncritically. If I'm right, then it's a shame since the issue really is vital to the country.Bev Harris, from the film's depiction, is a concerned citizen who stumbled across a mistake when she was doing an Internet search. Concerned about Diebold, which makes, programs, and sells electronic voting machines, she happened to find an ftp site that the company had neglected to remove from the Web. She downloaded over dozens of hours all sorts of files, including code to earlier versions of the voting programs. She allowed experts to look at the code, and they found serious flaws.However, Harris did more than just download codes. She went through the trash of various organizations, including a local government in Florida, finding all sorts of things, including (the film would have us believe) evidence of illegality in Florida. She also oversaw the hacking of a Diebold data card in what the film claims is proof that machines can be hacked. (The scene, it must be admitted, is impressive. Eight people vote in a pseudo-election, and the machine reports the results incorrectly. A 6-2 vote turns into a 7-1 vote the other way.)""Hacking Democracy"" is a gripping film, one that seems to strive for neutrality. There is one scene with a Republican candidate who noticed and videotaped an electronic malfunction. There is also a passing reference Republican objections to the voting machines in some states. Nonetheless, the focus on the two elections of 2000 and 2004 leaves the film with an apparent, if not actual, partisan bias. Even so, the film is more than compelling. It is frightening. Whether President Bush was duly elected once, twice, or never is beyond the point of the film, at least for me. The fact is that many parts of the country have entrusted elections to machines that are not sufficiently trustworthy, and more and more, the mechanisms of vote counting are hidden from nearly everyone. All we know is that people vote, the votes go into the proverbial black box, and then a result comes out.This is not to say that the machines are inaccurate. The film stops short of actually saying that any particular election was ""stolen,"" but the point that an election COULD be stolen is made abundantly clear. Therein lies a serious problem.""Hacking Democracy"" is at its weakest when it goes off on tangents that question the problems in Ohio and Florida. This is not to say that there were no problems; of course there were. Any human enterprise on the scale of a national election is going to have problems. However, ""Hacking Democracy"" seems to fail to appreciate this point. Thus, a mention of intolerably long lines at some Ohio precincts is present apparently to add information to the evidence against the Ohio election. But this parenthetical mention is not entirely fair; it is, as presented, more innuendo than substantive fact.""Hacking Democracy"" is, by contrast, at its strongest when it focuses on Harris, her fellow crusaders, and their struggles against a huge corporation. At the heart of the movie is a David versus Goliath story about a few individuals who take on a large, apparently corrupt corporation and, amazingly, come out ahead quite a few times. This human element seems to be missing from the film, which seems instead to want to rely on Harris's grandmotherly qualities to engender the viewer's sympathy.Still, ""Hacking Democracy"" is a vitally important film. Its message, however imperfect the delivery, is one that should be heard. Even if the charges in the film are incorrect (and I understand that Diebold vigorously denies most of them), it is vital that the country protect faith in the system, and the film offers a convincing argument that transparency is the most important step.",4,An important film,1181260800,"06 8, 2007",2007,4920,"['Was', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'ever', 'legitimately', 'elected', 'president', 'answer',

Harris's research proved that Diebold machines could be altered -- with no audit trail -- to produce incorrect vote totals.  With the aid of several computer security experts, Harris demonstrates at least four different methods of election tampering; all totally untraceable.  She catches Diebold executives on camera telling falsehoods about the reliability and security of their systems.  She films them perjuring themselves before Congress.Diebold of course denies all charges.Yet there were counties in the 2004 US Presidential election which delivered NEGATIVE vote totals (less than zero votes) for John Kerry.  Several critical jurisdictions reported extreme swaps in vote lead as counting progressed from 70% complete to 98% complete (and curiously always toward the Republican candidate).  Exit polls in both 2000 and 2004 differed markedly from the official election results in most states across the country.  Curious at best.Sinister at worst.  Diebold officials were huge fundraisers for Bush and stated publicly in 2003 that they were ""committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year.""  Granted, CEO Walden O'Dell later backpedaled and stated he only meant to advance Bush's re-election through advocacy, but any public partisan stance by the manufacturer of untraceable vote counters should raise concern among voters and election officials.Of course this is all history now.  The massive 2000 and 2004 election irregularities have been well-documented in many places.  It's good to remind ourselves however, going into 2012, that many of these problems appear to be still awaiting a fix.",5,"Stolen elections?
