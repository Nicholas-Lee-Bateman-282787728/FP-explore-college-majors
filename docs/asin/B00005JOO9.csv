642327,A33CGUK6890TP3,B00005JOO9,Andre Ali Seewood,"[0, 1]","Coming Home is a funny one note sort of film that is traditionally reserved for television commericials.  In fact, one could almost hear a Geiko Announcer or Toyota or some kind of car or real estate announcement at the end even though there isn't one.  The director has stated that he looks for simplicity and he got it, but it would have been very interesting if he could have pursued this idea further...  The film invites itself to expansion.  There is something interesting about this man, so oblivious to his -generic- surroundings that one house looks like the next house.  One Bedroom is reminescent of his own bedroom.  He seems just out of touch with modern reality like Tati's Mr. Hulot.  He looks for simpicity in today's supposedly complex world and finds everyone else confused.  But alas, all we have is Coming Home in three minutes...  I laughed, but not as long as I wanted to.",3,A Funny One Note,1129075200,"10 12, 2005",2005,894,"['Coming', 'Home', 'funny', 'one', 'note', 'sort', 'film', 'traditionally', 'reserved', 'television', 'commericials', 'fact', 'one', 'could', 'almost', 'hear', 'Geiko', 'Announcer', 'Toyota', 'kind', 'car', 'real', 'estate', 'announcement', 'end', 'even', ""n't"", 'one', 'director', 'stated', 'simplicity', 'got', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'interesting', 'could', 'have', 'pursued', 'idea', 'further', 'film', 'expansion', 'something', 'interesting', 'man', 'so', 'oblivious', '-generic-', 'surroundings', 'one', 'house', 'next', 'house', 'One', 'Bedroom', 'reminescent', 'own', 'bedroom', 'just', 'touch', 'modern', 'reality', 'Tati', 'Mr.', 'Hulot', 'simpicity', 'today', 'supposedly', 'complex', 'world', 'everyone', 'else', 'confused', 'alas', 'have', 'Coming', 'Home', 'three', 'minutes', 'laughed', 'not', 'as', 'long', 'wanted']",Coming Home Theatrical Release

At the end of it I was waiting for the annoucner to come on and say ""drink bud light and this won't happen to you!"" or some cheesey line like that.Sure, this is a short film competition, but this film is just too short.

WRONG!It's so different from what I thought it would be. It's a film that we can all relate to.  We all have that psychological fear that one day our mate will cheat on us and that we'll walk in on them in the action. This film plays on our fear and presents a humoristic twist to this paranoia.It sure made me laugh and at a $10.00 budget?  I think it's an excellent film.  It causes you to feel the desired emotion with so little film time and so little effort.
