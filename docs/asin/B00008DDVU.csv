Guns DO kill people; and the people who use them are the cowards that stand behind them.  The American Rifle Murderers and others of their ilk try to hide behind a Second Amendment that is now outdated historically and morally.  And their gun lobbying and support have produced not only Columbine but the most recent tragedy in Virginia (2007).

Excercise that great right afforded to you by living in this country.I have seen this film 4 times and it is not about gun control!  I think the title and the brash, in-your-face stance of the film have caused many viewers to jump to hasty opinions. There are three issues in regard to this film that in my humble opinion are far more important and discussion worthy than gun control:1) US history of violent foreign policy blunders. (I had American friends in El Salvador, and I was in Muslim SE Asia during the bombing of Sudan)2) The atmosphere of fear created and perpetuated by the popular media.* C'mon - I know some of you didn't enjoy the eve of Dec 31st, 1999.* I was scared of the African Bees too* Every classroom at the school where I teach has been issued duct tape and plastic even though the only building of noteworthy stature in the area is a wooden roller coaster.* If you don't chuckle when the White House issues a ""blanket alert"" in response to a ""general threat"" then you may be lost already with this issue.  And if you think that the White House issues those timely alerts because they are concerned about your safety then you are hopelessly lost.3) Is this film really a ""documentary""??Regardless of your opinion on the third issue - you owe it to yourself to see ""Bowling for Columbine."" I look forward to reading your review and hearing your thoughtful opinion.PS - Enough with the bashing of Michael Moore at the Oscars!!! Who cares??  Let's review the film here and let Joan Rivers discuss his stage etiquette.  Moore's not an actor for many reasons.

739177,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00008DDVU,A Customer,"[8, 16]","Summary:Michael Moore wants to figure out why there are so many murders by guns in the United States.  There are far more gun related murders in the U.S. each year than in any other country.  So, he visits numerous people (including Charlton Heston, Marilyn Manson, Barry Glassner, and many others) and uses a conglomeration of archive footage to see if he can answer the question.My Comments:The movie itself is fascinating; it is funny and disturbing at the same time.  And, it keeps your attention.  I was surprised that the topic was well-enough presented to keep my attention for two hours.  Especially funny was the cartoon from South Park (narrated by a bullet) that talks about the history of the United States.There is, however, a small problem - Moore never really answers the question outright.  He kind of leaves you thinking that the reason there are so many deaths is because there is a culture of fear in the U.S. that is promoted by the media.  This is coupled with the ready and easy access of guns.  And he gives you the impression that this is just one among a number of other problems that are resulting from capitalism and poverty in the U.S.  But, you are left kind of wondering how all of this works together to result in so many gun-related murders.Overall, the movie is entertaining and thought-provoking, but doesn't really answer the question completely.",4,Why are Americans so into guns?,1049068800,"03 31, 2003",2003,1381,"['Summary', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'murders', 'guns', 'United', 'States', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'gun', 'related', 'murders', 'U.S.', 'year', 'other', 'country', 'So', 'numerous', 'people', 'including', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'Barry', 'Glassner', 'many', 'others', 'conglomeration', 'archive', 'footage', 'see', 'can', 'answer', 'question.My', 'Comments', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'funny', 'disturbing', 'same', 'time', 'attention', 'was', 'surprised', 'topic', 'was', 'well-enough', 'presented', 'keep', 'attention', 'two', 'hours', 'Especially', 'funny', 'was', 'cartoon', 'South', 'Park', 'narrated', 'bullet', 'history', 'United', 'States.There', 'however', 'small', 'problem', 'Moore', 'never', 'really', 'question', 'outright', 'kind', 'leaves', 'thinking', 'reason', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'deaths', 'culture', 'fear', 'U.S.', 'promoted', 'media', 'coupled', 'ready', 'easy', 'access', 'guns', 'impression', 'just', 'one', 'number', 'other', 'problems', 'are', 'resulting', 'capitalism', 'poverty', 'U.S', 'are', 'left', 'kind', 'wondering', 'how', 'together', 'result', 'so', 'many', 'gun-related', 'murders.Overall', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'thought-provoking', ""n't"", 'really', 'answer', 'question', 'completely']",Bowling For Columbine VHS
739178,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00008DDVU,Acute Observer,"[1, 4]","Bowling for Columbine, 2003 filmThe film starts by showing a North Country bank in Michigan where a depositor can get a free gun. [How much money is needed?] Michael Moore shows his sense of humor in these opening scenes. Can a dog commit a crime in Michigan? Moore is incorrect in claiming Gandhi ""beat the British Empire"", that statement is incomplete. One scene shows a student's interest in chemistry. Some live news scenes follow, but the film doesn't explain them. Recognize them? Then a short history of US political coups and massacres in foreign countries since WW II. Moore associates the terrorist bombing in Kosovo (no military objective) with the shootings at Columbine high school. Next we see Charlton Heston standing up for his right to travel peacefully to an NRA convention. Outside a small group protests the right of the NRA to peacefully assemble! (How un-American!) Moore shows the views of some students. What does this say about their Educational system? Next Moore interviews a singer; is any musician or actor a reliable source of wisdom? Bowling can be educational, according to these scenes. Moore's statistics are biased since it does not compare the rates of violent deaths. That frantic cartoon is not historically accurate, a mistake for any ""documentary"". Killer bees are in fact invading America, along with fire ants.More scenes follow, they are either biased and racist, or, reflect the reality of an oppressed people. Who was blamed when blacks were scarce as in late 19th century American cities? Some people say crime rate was falling but the corporate media featured crimes in the TV news. Really true? A producer explains the rationale of the ""Cops"" TV show. Does it reinforce prejudice? The film shows a small town in Canada; it has few murders (like a similar small town in America). One good question is why the murder rate is lower in Canada. [But if it is just about the same as in America, why ask?] Small towns in America may have the same unlocked doors of small town Ontario. Creating fear is a well-known method for controlling a subject population.Moore points out how bad economic conditions are reflected in a high homicide rate, but this is not ""news"" for the corporate media. Basically, it tells how poor people are oppressed by having a long commute. Maybe they need public housing located close to their job? The stunt at the chain store that sold bullets seems unfair, I wonder why that chain later suffered an economic setback? There is a final interview with Charlton Heston. Moore's question about the murder rates seems dishonest (look up these rates for yourself). The rate of violent deaths in Canada is similar to the USA. Given Canada's northern latitude it should be lower. Did Moore drag out the interview to cause Charlton Heston to leave for his next appointment? If so, was this honest? Moore is a skilled showman if he can make this collection of scenes into popular entertainment.Documentaries lie on the continuum between news and fiction. Anything real, filmed as it happens, is ""news""; except for sports, it is rare on TV. Fiction must appear plausible to be believed by the audience. Documentaries are ""recreations of authenticated facts"" like the nature films on TV. They are created and edited to portray a point of view. Their success depends on the number of consumers who pay, dollars not academic truths. The use of films for propaganda (a point of view) follows the use of newspapers, pamphlets, and books. Some are better than others, and age gracefully. Did Moore create scenes by splicing together separate events? Are speeches taken out of context? Are events portrayed without their background? Its all part of Show [me the money] Business, the art of getting people's money in return for telling a story. Does exploiting the Columbine massacre show poor taste by Michael Moore?One Big Lie is that America has more gun violence than other countries. That is as true as saying America has more automobile deaths than other countries. America's rate of violent death (suicides and murders) falls behind France, Switzerland, etc., and Japan, but just ahead of Canada. Canada's crime rate was lower before 1977 when they banned handguns; now it approaches American rates. There is no mention of Mexico, Brazil, or Argentina, who have similar colonial and revolutionary pasts. Any research will reveal these facts, which are usually suppressed in the Corporate Media. If America was such a violent hell on earth there wouldn't be 3,000 illegal immigrants each day!

739179,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,B00008DDVU,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[10, 17]","Michael Moore's latest film ""Bowling for Columbine"" is an in your face expose on the insanity of gun violence plaguing the US. It uses Moore's cutting edge humor to get the point across well:  our gun laws or lack thereof are insane.  The film's title comes from the fact that the Columbine shooters went bowling right before their rampage.  And this film includes actual surveillance video of the rampage inside the school.  Another bowling connection is that militias use bowling pins for target practice.Michael interviews some Michigan Militia in action and find they are just normal people...with some abnormal hobbies.  Then he interviews the brother of Terry Nichols (the Oklahoma City conspirator) and we see a true lunatic in action; among other things he takes his loaded .45 from under his pillow and puts it to his own head...even Michael gets nervous.  Brother Nichols shows his worldliness when Michael asks about Ghandi.  ""I'm not familiar with that.""He then interviews a Littleton defense worker about Columbine and tries to draw the connection between the world's biggest arms manufacturer and the school shootings.  The worker says ""well we don't bomb someone just cause we don't like them"", and the film cuts to the whole long list of US backed coups most progressives are familiar with.  This makes the point in a flawed way, as we didn't ""bomb"" some of the countries we overthrew, so it comes off as a bit preachy and propagandistic.We then see that most countries in Europe have annual gun death rates of under 100, while US average is over 11,000.  Then we're in Canada, a very low crime gun culture where people leave their doors open...literally!Michael interviews Charlton Heston and challenges him on his NRA exploits.  This causes Heston to walk away, but HEY, he did at least do an interview...what Dick Clark does in this film is Despicable.We end with Michael bringing 2 Columbine victims to Kmart to get them to stop selling bullets.  A small victory in an ocean of gun insanity.Every American should see this film and then write your Congressman if you've had enough of gun violence in the country.",4,"Very Good film, THE definitive film on US gun insanity",1042070400,"01 9, 2003",2003,2131,"['Michael', 'Moore', 'latest', 'film', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'face', 'expose', 'insanity', 'gun', 'violence', 'plaguing', 'US', 'Moore', 'cutting', 'edge', 'humor', 'get', 'point', 'across', 'well', 'gun', 'laws', 'lack', 'thereof', 'are', 'insane', 'film', 'title', 'fact', 'Columbine', 'shooters', 'went', 'bowling', 'right', 'rampage', 'film', 'actual', 'surveillance', 'video', 'rampage', 'school', 'bowling', 'connection', 'militias', 'use', 'bowling', 'pins', 'target', 'practice.Michael', 'Michigan', 'Militia', 'action', 'find', 'are', 'just', 'normal', 'people', 'abnormal', 'hobbies', 'Then', 'brother', 'Terry', 'Nichols', 'Oklahoma', 'City', 'conspirator', 'see', 'true', 'lunatic', 'action', 'other', 'things', 'loaded', '.45', 'pillow', 'own', 'head', 'even', 'Michael', 'nervous', 'Brother', 'Nichols', 'worldliness', 'when', 'Michael', 'Ghandi', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'then', 'Littleton', 'defense', 'worker', 'Columbine', 'tries', 'draw', 'connection', 'world', 'biggest', 'arms', 'manufacturer', 'school', 'shootings', 'worker', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'bomb', 'someone', 'just', 'cause', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'cuts', 'whole', 'long', 'list', 'US', 'backed', 'coups', 'most', 'progressives', 'are', 'familiar', 'point', 'flawed', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'bomb', 'countries', 'overthrew', 'off', 'bit', 'preachy', 'propagandistic.We', 'then', 'see', 'most', 'countries', 'Europe', 'have', 'annual', 'gun', 'death', 'rates', '100', 'US', 'average', '11,000', 'Then', ""'re"", 'Canada', 'very', 'low', 'crime', 'gun', 'culture', 'where', 'people', 'leave', 'doors', 'open', 'literally', 'Michael', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'NRA', 'Heston', 'walk', 'away', 'HEY', 'did', 'least', 'do', 'interview', 'what', 'Dick', 'Clark', 'film', 'Despicable.We', 'end', 'Michael', 'bringing', '2', 'Columbine', 'victims', 'Kmart', 'get', 'stop', 'selling', 'bullets', 'small', 'victory', 'ocean', 'gun', 'insanity.Every', 'American', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'then', 'write', 'Congressman', ""'ve"", 'had', 'enough', 'gun', 'violence', 'country']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

739181,A1PMDTYRAIPGXW,B00008DDVU,Adam P Boots,"[8, 12]","Alright... I had to do it... Bowling For Columbine. The Review.First of all, I heard nothing but rave reviews for this film from a lot of people out in America, including the Academy Awards (?), so I thought... maybe I should check it out?After watching, I can say that I should have referred back to that time when I thought it would be a good idea to watch The English Patient because of the Academy Awards... I was fairly unimpressed. But then again, what can I expect? I've seen Michael Moore's work before and I should KNOW that he's not doing a true documentary, but really, he's trying to write propaganda. OK... Point noted... Propaganda can be interesting... How else could Hitler have enrolled as many youth? In fact, for sheer entertainment value, Bowling For Columbine is pretty entertaining... There are a lot of humorous parts, and as a coherent unit, this movie does ok... It's really too bad that it's so driven by Mr. Moore's views rather than by those pesky FACTS.For example, instead of attacking the person who was responsible for allowing a gun to get in the hands of a young child who eventually killed another child, he decided to pick a fight with Dick Clark, because Mr. Clark didn't pay enough money for the mother of said child to be able to afford her rent... Um... Dick Clark? So you're saying that because this child's mother works at a Dick Clark restaurant and doesn't make enough to live on, that's why her kid killed another kid? Sounds like she's in DESPARATE need of an education and a new job... But is that DICK CLARK's FAULT?Well, on some very 7 steps to Kevin Bacon logic, yeah, that kind of works... but... The kid wouldn't have a gun if his uncle didn't have possession of it. His Uncle, as I recall, was a convicted felon, which means that just having possession of the gun in the house is against the law, another felony, in fact but... Dick Clark is at fault... Hmmm... THAT MAKES SENSE!Another interesting tidbit is that, though Charlton Heston does an interview in this movie, and the interview DOES make him sound like a completely bigotted racist in the context it was used, Mr. Moore also replays a NRA Convention quote from Mr. Heston saying &quot;from my cold dead hands.&quot; This statement is shocking in the context it's referred to (the NRA Convention soon after Columbine, in Denver), and sounds like possibly the most heartless and poorly thought-out speech ever... It's really too bad that the speech happened in a completely different town at a completely different time... Admittedly, Mr. Heston did well enough putting his foot in his mouth in his interview with Mr. Moore, but if you're going to quote him out of context in another situation, then you might as well ignore the entire interview, as it's edited and possibly out of context as well. It's like taking a video of someone and turning it into a picture... While the video may look perfect, you can always make someone look like an idiot by catching them in a still frame with their eyes closed, mouth open, and head cocked to some strange position...As I said before, this is entertaining propaganda. It moves along at a brisk pace, has some humorous parts, and some interesting footage of the Columbine shootings that I had never seen before, but aside from that, I have trouble accepting this as a &quot;documentary&quot; because of errors in the facts and extremely edited interviews that appear to take quotes out of context.If it weren't humorous at times, this would have gotten a star. I gave it three, because it's considerably more interesting than the Nazi Propaganda efforts, probably because of a much more light-hearted approach.

739186,A2FQ3K6PR86U62,B00008DDVU,Alyosha,"[5, 8]","I can't see how the anti-gun movement is anything less than yet another radical feminist assault on the alpha male.  I mean, let's face it, women don't own guns, don't use guns, don't want to have anything to do with guns.  This comes in sharp contrast to the relationship men have with guns where firearms are seen as items of recreation, tools of security, a safety insurance for them and their loved ones.  This sense of safety, security, and perhaps even empowerment amongst men is something the feminist movement absolutely WILL NOT tolerate.  Every man must be emasculated because if a feminist were being robbed in her home or on the street and a man (say perhaps a boyfriend, husband, or father) came up and blew the robber away this feminist would have a hard time justifying her crackpot ideology.  And of course the magnum opus of the Flower Power generation was that ideas never need to be justified so long as we feel ""sincerely"" about them.  This has very little to do with guns and everything to do with feminist attempts to correct male behavior.  They'd want to take swords and sheilds away if we had them.Not suprisingly the already passified and waif Michael Moore had no qualms about reflecting these views in his film which is quite suprising given that Moore himself grew up in Kent, Michigan, a town where street gangs and other scum keep the citizenry in a constant state of fear.  This is hardly anything new for urban America where women can't walk down the street at night, where adults can't even correct wild teenagers in public for fear of being pistol whipped.Of course Moore presents no solutions to these problems but the idea that the police, given enough time and money, would be able to get things under control is always assumed.  And that's exactly what this boils down to: Moore's and the anti-gun movement's inability to come to terms with the fact that any normal kind of police presence isn't going to be able to control crimes against civilians.There are restrictions on state power and naturally criminals use that to their advantage.  This is because we live in a free society, well, at least we used to.  People don't want to see a team of cops on every corner, in every building, in every subway car because realistically that is what it would take to get crime under control.  That's what it took in New York but what about the other hundreds of cities that don't have a hundred billion dollar budget and who have citizens that don't want to live in a police state?  Well...They could look to the Second Amendment but of course Moore has his own twist on that idea, ridiculously trying to cast the Right to Bear Arms as a ""right to overthrow tyranny.""  The thing Moore fails to realize was that the Bill of Rights was written before the French Revolution and before Marxism; back when the idea that a few farmers could topple a central government would've been seen by anyone, especially the elites, as utterly preposterous.  More than likely I would think that the Second Amendment was written with folks on the frontier in mind where having a tomahawk sunk into your skull was far from an uncommon event.  Also this was written at a time when a great deal of the police work (keeping in mind that most folks did not live in cities) and keeping a state of order was done by regular folks.  Defending yourself and your household would have, in most cases, been an entirely personal endeavor.It's not so much repulsive as it is bizarre watching Michael Moore go to work on these little projects of his.  I mean, in a documentary that is supposed to be about gun control he spends about a half hour on the Oklahoma City Bombing.  What an attack that was carried out with a truck bomb has to do with guns or gun control I'll never know.  Instead it's just a pathetically calculated excuse for Moore to mention that Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols happened to be gun owners.  Look, these terrible people owned guns so if you own one you'll be terrible just like them!  Even Hitler had a gun!  You don't want to be Hitler do you?  Endlessly amateurish.  Infinitely infantile.It's really weird the way Moore is seen by so many millions as the lovable champion of the people.  Sort of like a pretentious and much fatter version of John Candy.  The truth is Michael Moore cares about the average person's problems but only in the same way that every one else in Hollywood cares about the average person which is not so much caring about them as it is wanting to make them ""better.""  Typical Marxist hatred of the Middle Class.  There's no place for this garbage in Middle or Working Class America.Wouldn't it be better living in a world where instead of finding helpless victims criminals found themselves getting pumped full of lead?  I'll give it 2 stars because it was at least watchable.",2,The Hollywood Propaganda Machine In Full Motion,1188000000,"08 25, 2007",2007,4833,"['ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'anti-gun', 'movement',

It must have been either because few other documentaries were made that year or the academy must be made up of persons who are primarily anti-gun.This video is okay, but it is not likely to change anyone's mind concerning gun control.  Most of it is uninspired and two-dimensional.  The goal appears to make gun owners out to be violent and dangerous, yet too stupid to know it.  Similar videos could be made by anyone, against anyone, on almost any topic desired.  It is not difficult ostracize an enemy.  Unfortunately it is not hard to find people who will pat you on the back for doing so.  Such action creates pack mentality and relieves us of the burden of having to think for ourselves.There are, however, some exceptional moments in this film.  I do not like films that stereotype and berate others, but the humor leveled at gun owners works.  It is funny, even if in poor taste.  It reminds me of Jeff Foxworthy's ""red-neck"" comedy.  The difference is that Jeff Foxworthy identifies with red-necks in humorous way.  This film comes across as a more enlightened person, who has risen beyond his roots, poking fun at those who are still ""hicks"".This film does have one truly inspiring moment.  It is during the last few moments of the film.  After declaring America's moral uprightness, the film juxtaposes the Columbine shooting against America's long list of questionable foreign policy actions.  This segment drops all humor and allows facts and pictures to speak for themselves.  This comes with touching theme music.  Had the majority of the film been left on the director's cutting room floor and this one segment kept as a music video it would have been one of the most powerful segments created.

They do not want dialogue, or American's to be informed.The documentary is incredibly fascinating, funny, scary, well researched, provocing and probably will leave you a little changed afterwards. As a great documentatary should and typical of Michael's style, it opens up questions rather than tells  answers. Hopefully there this creates more dialogue between Americans. We need to come up with the answers.I live in Colorado, within 100 miles of Columbine so I am aware of many of the items that are documented.As usual Michael put things in his documentary that are incredibly funny and entertaining as well as disturbing and thought provoking.What he always does is document facts. A look at Michael's web site [...] documents proof of everyone of the items that the puppets from the Fox network, etc try to say are inaccurate. Yes, that bank does give away guns, yes Charlton Heston and his Rifle Association did what they did right after the deaths of those poor children as well as the trauma they suffered in Colorado. Really stuck it to those parents and students who were picketing for some respect and sensitivity to the victims. Not in the movie is the republican demonated Colorado state legislatures answer to Columbine. It was to post the &quot;Ten Commandents in every Colorado school&quot;. By the way,  they are not accurate in their english interpetation, but that is besides the point.Yes that quote about the ethnic mixing Charleton made was incredibly revealing.Who the else has the courage to go to places and talk to people that he does.What I found so wonderful about Michael's work is that he lets the words and the pictures stand on its own merit and his work always asks more questions than they answer. It is up to us, presented with information that we are not going to get from the U.S. media, or the research, or the people's direct words.This one is not to be missed for ANYONE, and I hope political brainwashing will not keep people away.

He depicts facts about our country's bloody past and present hitting the streets to talk to real people who are all in one way or another affected by guns. He makes you think as he tries to uncover why America has the highest death rate of people killed by guns in the world. I couldn't believe how different it is just to live in Canada. They support each other and have pride in who they are, unlike America's self-centered every-person-for-themselves attitude. The Canadian evening news actually talks about good things and their citizens don't live in constant fear. They had maybe 60 some gun related deaths in the past year to America's staggering 11,000 or so. Still, it isn't so much a film on gun control as it is a film on how we live daily in conformity, and how we are conditioned to believe things based on what we see in the media. He shows the sad stupidity of religious groups picketing a Marilyn Manson concert with the claims that Manson condones violence. But yet the hypocrites state that they won't let Manson in their city  &quot;not without a fight.&quot; Moore allows Manson to share his views, which is something that a lot of people need to do,  just sit down and listen and find out the truth about things before passing judgment. Moore challenges each and everyone one of us to use our freedoms as Americans to try and change the oppressiveness of our country, to stop fearing diversity and to speak up and have a voice. The first step in doing this is to just turn off the television. Stop bombarding our brains with all the negativity, blood shed, and urban legends that is conditioned into us so that we remain living in fear.With this, Moore won a much deserved Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.

Micheal goes to diffrent places to interview regular people and superstars and even members of the nra to find out thier perspectives and address the whole gun issue in America. He travels to Canada to investigate why they think there is so little crime in other parts of the world even though they are permitted to have guns and why gun violence is so prevelant in America. Micheal just wants to investigate and help people open thier eyes to these facts- the people who have a problem with this usually are nra members or republicans. I cant understand that. Micheal didnt attack anyone in this documentary all he did was address the issues and ask questions and some ( charleton heston ) for example didnt want to face it and walked away. Micheal is an excellent filmmaker and has a unique style and gets his message across. This really makes you think. Im not suprised he won an oscar. Cant wait for his next film fahrenheit 9/11.

""brnn64""","[1, 3]","There is much to like AND dislike about this movie.people often dismiss M/M as a leftist, but I think he strikes a balance in this film as an equal-opportunity critic of both the far left AND the far right (note the discussion with Marilyn Manson about Bill Clinton where they both are quite critical of Mr. Bill).The sections on Canada and gun control are quite deep in debunking the rationales of causes of violence in America. However, trying to compare violence in different countires and cultures (i.e., comparing America's violent past with the fact that Germany has less violence today but was responsible for the Holocaust) depends on relativity and perspective.The section on blacks, violence, and the media was dead-on target, with Mike and a white professor walking through South Central Los Angeles without anyone trying to harm them, although it would have been interesting if they had interviewed one of the residents about their opinions of the perceptions of their community. The cartoon on violence and race relations was also thought provoking, if a tad simplified (the 'toon omits the fact that blacks DID rebel against our oppression between the slave rebellions and Rosa Parks, although this is not well known among non-historians).The Charlton Heston interview was ok, except I did not like the exploitation of the picture of the dead six year old Michigan girl who was killed by gunfire and what Mike does with the picture in this scene. This smacks of opporunitist grandstanding of the worst kind, and I would hate to see the reaction of the child's parents to this!But that is the only thing I really disliked about the film.

I agree to some comments on here, that being a Canadian, it may not be as safe to live here in Canada as Moore portrays it.  But comparing to the USA, HELL YEA!  We may have tons of guns, but much less percentage of us actually use them just because we dislike someone, or the way someone drove on the highway.  There have been school shootings in Canada and Germany too..not only USA.  But to my knowledge so far, it seems like the Columbine incident was one of the major first 'role model incident' that has sparked such interests to the mentally sick and left out kids in high school, in which there were several school shootings following Columbine.  Of course, if reasons are these individuals were being bullied prior to such revengful incidents, the bullies should be taking the responsibility as well.Anyhow...6 yr old with a gun?  Ok similar incident happened here in Canada too... but shootings and murders happen so often every day in the US, its not possible to keep track.  News only report locally.  Yes, USA has a much larger population than Canada..but even if you calculate the percentage, the US does still end up having a much higher average of annual murders or random shootings.Oh yes, black people or other refugees who immigrated from less fortunate countries still have to work low wages, work their butts off...and still not being able to earn enough to support a small family.  Of course the states have enough money (or enough power to solve something)...but of course, it is never a priority.  Rich people are more prioritized.  Sure, government cutbacks happen everywhere...but it seems that even if the US is perfectly fine financially, they would prefer using money to build bombs and send troops (of foreign origins) to fight and die for a country they don't even have permission living in yet, only wished to.  And bribing such immigration-applicants to fight for the country in order to gain immigration status is not terrible enough?  There is so much wrong with the USA (as a whole), that it is sickening.  Of course, I HEARD from TV as well.  But it seems that I don't even need a DVD such as &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; to see where the US' attitude.  Bush's own words prove a lot already.  They can quickly point fingers at music stars like Marilyn Manson (which I read that the 2 Columbine murderers didnt even listen to, in the first place), yet they can NEVER blame their own media in which they depend on daily, such as CNN, movies.....and Bush.  Oh, power black-out...blame Canada first: Easy way out...save their own butts.This is a great DVD for anyone who is curious why so many out there still hate &quot;America&quot; despite what happened in Sept. 11...and despite the &quot;Americanized&quot; lifestyles that we live happily with.  Some of you may find that not 100% of the contents are right, but then again, who &amp; WHAT is perfect?  But it is definately good realization of what the world is dealing with.  There are terrorists out there...yet the US (Bush &amp; the government of course, not all the citizens of course) are not responding in a correct enough way.

It is not an anti-gun movie (Moore is apparently a lifetime NRA member).  It is more a reflection on American society and the violence which is so pervasive.  Canadians have millions of guns and their homicide rate by use of the gun is all but nil.  So too many, many other countries -- their homicide by use of the gun dribbles down to almost nonexistent.  In America, over 10,000 people per year are killed by a gun.  The ol' maxim that 'guns don't kill people, people kill people' is perhaps the theme of the film.  The big question is why it is that this country, one espousing such freedom, has such a disproportionate homicide rate.There are moments of high comedy (South Park's history of America is in the film and it is a hoot) and moments of feelings that go deep (footage from Columbine) and moments of great irony (the quote given by an interviewee just before a rather gruesome list (and footage) of America's history of use of bombs is displayed).  Moore has assembled a tapestry that amazingly weaves in and around Flint, Michigan (and, oddly, bowling) and he has talked with a great many people, from the creators of South Park (students of Columbine) to Charlton Heston, to the father of a child killed at Columbine to gun totin' militamen from his home state, for a diversity of points of view of the issue.It may seem to some that he is provoking a desired response by his questioning but the reality is that the answers given by those he interviewed speak freely and it is their words, spoken with conviction and sincerity, that ultimately leave the viewer mystified.The interview with Charlton Heston left me speechless.  The man who boldly proclaims 'from my dead hands' reveals another side of himself.All in all, the movie is disturbing but it is not brashly so.  It merely reveals to us all the various absurdities in the freedom we so cherish.

In the past I've sometimes been uncomfortable when Moore puts underlings on the spot, harassing them for the actions of corporate heads, but happily that never happens here.  Instead, each scene is thoughtful and insightful, raising provocative questions that any thoughtful person -- conservative or liberal -- should ask themselves about violence in this country.  I've long been interested in this issue and have read a lot, but I still found surprising information here.  It's easy to think that we are more violent (with over eleven thousand gun deaths a year) because we watch violent movies and play violent video games -- but so do the Japanese; it's easy to think we may be more violent because we have a violent past -- but so do Germans; it's easy to think we might be more violent because we have so many guns in this country -- but so do Canadians.Moore travels to Littleton Colorado, Flint Michigan, California and Canada, and he speaks to law enforcement officials, teachers, Marilyn Manson, Charleton Heston and Columbine students as he tries to piece together what makes America so uniquely violent.  Moore and his team come up with some answers, but even more questions, in this important film.DVD extras are plentiful and include: a trailer; a short introduction by Moore; a 15-minute monologue about his Academy Award acceptance speech (though the Academy wouldn't let Moore use footage of the event); film commentary by secretaries, interns and production assistants; a talk Moore gave to a Littleton, Colorado, crowd in February 2003; a 16-minute featurette about the film's reception at Cannes, the Oscars and the Toronto Film Festival; and Marilyn Manson's ""Fight Song"" music video.The issue of violence in America should supersede politics, and Moore does not mention politics in the film.  When so many of us have been touched by violence, it is in ALL our interests to try to make sense of it and improve the situation.  Do conservatives OR liberals want to live in a world where we are afraid, where we are victimized, where we are torn from friends and relatives by violence?  This is an important issue and Moore has made an important film.

Bowling for Columbine is completely an &quot;in your face - no holds barred&quot; kind of movie.  I personally think that Michael Moore is brilliant.  His books are amazing as are his films.  He asks the questions and talks about the subjects that people would rather sweep under the mat.In BFC, Moore sets out to explore the roots of why the United States of America is notorious for its astronomical number of people killed by firearms.  In doing so, he learns that the conventional answers of easy availability of guns, violent national history, violent entertainment and even poverty are inadequate to explain this violence when other cultures share those same factors without the equivalent carnage. In order to arrive at a possible explanation, Michael Moore takes on a deeper examination of America's culture of fear, bigotry and violence in a nation with widespread gun ownership.

Wolverton,"[4, 15]","You can say what you want about director Michael Moore, and people have said quite a lot on both sides; but the man is talented and he can get people talking.  And I think that's probably one of his primary goals.Moore is funny, cynical, caring, compassionate, scornful, and unflinching.  All of these attributes come across in `Bowling for Columbine,' a film that examines two aspects of American life: our relationship with guns and our fears of...well, everything.  Moore uses the tragic events at Columbine as a jumping off point to underscore and reinforce his thoughts that America is the most violent country in the world.  How and why did it happen?  Why does America have more deaths by handguns than any other country?  The examination of these questions is riveting and fascinating.I'll never forget the disturbing footage from the school cameras at Columbine.  That's not the only disturbing footage in the film.  But there's also some incredibly funny scenes, one of them a cartoon chronicling America's greatest fears throughout her history.  But probably the most unforgettable scene is the interview with NRA President Charlton Heston.  I'll never forget how the interview ended and what happened immediately after.  Simple, but powerful filmmaking.The film extras are many and are generally good.  The overall distraction is Moore's unending tirade against George Bush.  Whatever you may think of Bush, he is not the primary focus of the film.  So why does Moore spend so much time blasting him in the bonus footage?As for the film itself, there are no easy answers and Moore doesn't really expect any.

739200,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B00008DDVU,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[2, 3]","This movie asks way more questions than it answers. Perhaps all documentaries are like that, but in the other Michael Moore movies I have seen to date, ""Roger & Me"" and ""Sicko,"" Moore seemed to have a far clearer idea of what might be done to fix the problem. In spite of his triumph over K-Mart, he does not seem to be suggesting that a gun ban is the answer. But then, his interview with Charlton Heston didn't really give him a chance to make any suggestions, either. Indeed, Moore is far more into ambiguity here than I would have expected. In fact, the best suggestion came from a comedian that suggested the price of ammunition should be raised to something like $5,000 per bullet. He jokes about the guy who says, ""Boy, I'd shoot you right now if I could afford it.""Of course, it is a very tough topic. Why do other countries have so very much lower rate of gun-related homicides per year? Certainly nothing so simple as guns per capita: Canada has far more guns per capita, and an amazingly low gun-murder rate. But then, Canada's population density is tiny compared to ours. And the difference in climate is also relevant. Passions cool pretty quickly up there in that northern clime.One of the crimes on which Moore places a good bit of focus was the little boy who took his uncle's gun to school and shot one of the girls in his class. They were both six years old at the time. But when he confronts Charlton Heston about it, why doesn't Heston point out was not that the boy's uncle owned a gun, but that he was a very irresponsible gun owner, or the boy would never have gotten hold of the gun.My own attitude about guns can hardly be called unbiased: My Steve committed suicide using a hand gun, one of several he owned. But he was by no means a ""gun nut."" He had them for two reasons: (1) self-defense and also defense of his home, and (2) the purpose to which he ultimately put it. He needed a gun to feel secure against the possibility of being forced to stay alive under conditions he found intolerable.But it is also true that people do need to have means of self-defense, as they police are not generally there when someone breaks into your home or attempts to rob you. They will show up later and write up the facts, and possibly even arrest the guilty party; but they cannot be everywhere at once. As one Michigan State Militia member points out, it is your responsibility as an adult to defend your home and your family.The Second Amendment gives us the right to bear arms and specifically mentions ""a well-regulated militia"" as the reason. But there's that word ""regulated"" to consider. An outright ban is not only unconstitutional, but unenforceable and ill-advised. It is a true cliche that when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns. It is also true that the first thing a tyrant does is confiscate all the guns in the hands of the citizens. But certainly we want to keep guns out of the hands of six-year-olds and psychotic high school students, as well as gang bangers, robbers and people who are not in control of themselves.In the course of the movie, any number of people mentioned that the reason the US has so many guns is that we are consumed by fear. And they rightly point out that mass media and marketing pump up that fear because fearful people are easier to manipulate. The primary thing that struck Moore (and myself) about Canadians is they are not nearly so fearful as we are. Nearly everyone owns a gun, and with all that wilderness, Canadians are very big on hunting, but they have nothing like the gun crime rate we have. Why? What to do about it? Moore does not seem to have an answer.I don't have any easy answers, either, but Moore and a couple of Columbine survivors DID manage to persuade K-Mart to stop selling guns and ammo.",3,One of Michael Moore's Best-Known Works,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,3787,"['movie', 'way', 'more', 'questions', 'Perhaps', 'documentaries', 'are', 'other', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'date', 'Roger', 'Me', 'Sicko', 'Moore', 'seemed', 'have', 'far', 'clearer', 'idea', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'done', 'fix', 'problem', 'spite', 'triumph', 'K-Mart', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'suggesting', 'gun', 'ban', 'answer', 'then', 'interview', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'chance', 'make', 'suggestions', 'either', 'Indeed', 'Moore', 'far', 'more', 'ambiguity', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'fact', 'best', 'suggestion', 'came', 'comedian', 'suggested', 'price', 'ammunition', 'should', 'be', 'raised', 'something', '5,000', 'bullet', 'guy', 'who', 'Boy', ""'d"", 'shoot', 'right', 'now', 'could', 'afford', 'course', 'very', 'tough', 'topic', 'Why', 'do', 'other', 'countries', 'have', 'so', 'very', 'much', 'lower', 'rate', 'gun-related', 'homicides', 'year', 'Certainly', 'nothing', 'so', 'simple', 'guns', 'capita', 'Canada', 'far', 'more', 'guns', 'capita', 'amazingly', 'low', 'gun-murder', 'rate', 'then', 'Canada', 'population', 'density', 'tiny', 'compared', 'ours', 'difference', 'climate', 'also', 'relevant', 'Passions', 'cool', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'there', 'northern', 'clime.One', 'crimes', 'Moore', 'good', 'bit', 'focus', 'was', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'took', 'uncle', 'gun', 'school', 'shot', 'one', 'girls', 'class', 'were', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'when', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'why', ""n't"", 'Heston', 'point', 'out', 'was', 'not', 'boy', 'uncle', 'owned', 'gun', 'was', 'very', 'irresponsible', 'gun', 'owner', 'boy', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'gotten', 'hold', 'gun.My', 'own', 'attitude', 'guns', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'called', 'unbiased', 'Steve', 'committed', 'suicide', 'using', 'hand', 'gun', 'one', 'several', 'owned', 'was', 'gun', 'nut', 'had', 'two', 'reasons', '1', 'self-defense', 'also', 'defense', 'home', '2', 'purpose', 'ultimately', 'put', 'needed', 'gun', 'feel', 'secure', 'possibility', 'being', 'forced', 'stay', 'alive', 'conditions', 'found', 'intolerable.But', 'also', 'true', 'people', 'do', 'need', 'have', 'means', 'self-defense', 'police', 'are', 'not', 'generally', 'when', 'someone', 'home', 'attempts', 'rob', 'will', 'show', 'up', 'later', 'write', 'up', 'facts', 'possibly', 'even', 'arrest', 'guilty', 'party', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'everywhere', 'once', 'one', 'Michigan', 'State', 'Militia', 'member', 'points', 'out', 'responsibility', 'adult', 'defend', 'home', 'family.The', 'Second', 'Amendment', 'right', 'bear', 'arms', 'specifically', 'mentions', 'well-regulated', 'militia', 'reason', 'word', 'regulated', 'consider', 'outright', 'ban', 'not', 'only', 'unconstitutional', 'unenforceable', 'ill-advised', 'true', 'cliche', 'when', 'guns', 'are', 'outlawed', 'only', 'outlaws', 'will', 'have', 'guns', 'also', 'true', 'first', 'thing', 'tyrant', 'confiscate', 'guns', 'hands', 'citizens', 'certainly', 'want', 'keep', 'guns', 'hands', 'six-year-olds', 'psychotic', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'as', 'well', 'gang', 'bangers', 'robbers', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'control', 'themselves.In', 'course', 'movie', 'number', 'people', 'mentioned', 'reason', 'US', 'so', 'many', 'guns', 'are', 'consumed', 'fear', 'rightly', 'point', 'out', 'mass', 'media', 'marketing', 'pump', 'fear', 'fearful', 'people', 'are', 'easier', 'manipulate', 'primary', 'thing', 'struck', 'Moore', 'Canadians', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'so', 'fearful', 'are', 'Nearly', 'everyone', 'gun', 'wilderness', 'Canadians', 'are', 'very', 'big', 'hunting', 'have', 'nothing', 'gun', 'crime', 'rate', 'have', 'Why', 'What', 'do', 'Moore', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'answer.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'easy', 'answers', 'either', 'Moore', 'couple', 'Columbine', 'survivors', 'DID', 'manage', 'persuade', 'K-Mart', 'stop', 'selling', 'guns', 'ammo']",Bowling For Columbine VHS
739201,A1EI65WJC85U68,B00008DDVU,"BD Ashley ""vidiot_y2k""","[20, 36]","Written, Produced and Directed by Michael Moore, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE fully deserves its Best Documentary Oscar. In fact, I'll admit that before I even watched this, I just presumed Moore was some pudgy idiot and wasn't expecting much given his ""Shame on you Mr Bush!"" comments. The spirit of Jane Fonda sadly isn't gone. I could just imagine Dubya sitting in front of the TV in the White House, watching the Oscars. After thinking a couple of minutes, he turns to the First Lady with a puzzled look and says ""Uh, Laura; honey. Was that chubby guy talkin' 'bout ME or 'bout DADDY? Maybe I'd better ring Mom.""But of course it was stupid & naive of me to approach my review in this manner. I may be a self-proclaimed ""vidiot"", but I'm a person who actually SITS DOWN AND WATCHES movies before I review or moan about them.BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is a doco everyone should watch. It's by turns biting, acerbically funny, disturbing, provocative, challenging & sobering.Practically right off the bat, Moore goes into a bank with a hidden camera to open an account. As a token of their appreciation he is given a free gun! They may as well hang a sign in their window saying ""PLEASE ROB US!"". Ironically we later learn the fact that Moore won an NRA marksman award as a teen. Is this irony? Or hypocrisy?Early on I remembered Charles Bronson's line in DEATH WISH 5: ""Guns have their uses. IDIOTS with guns make me nervous."" I felt that since the right to bear arms is in the U.S Constitution, no one should have the authority to impose their will upon others and violate those rights. Admittedly it's different in NZ, where gun laws are stricter: If an intruder broke into my house I would probably be forced to clock him on the head with my 2"" thick Leonard Maltin Movie Guide a few times and hope it works out in my favor.But check this out. Interviewed here are:1. A Guy with an ""Anarchist Cookbook"" on how to make bombs & napalm among other things. (I'm not THAT kind of anarchist!)2.Another guy who sleeps with a loaded gun under his pillow. Constitutional right? Or just bloody daft?3. Moore's visit to Lockhead Martin- the World's largest weapons manufacturer. One of their officials is interviewed standing in front of a nuclear warhead and saying he's not doing anything wrong. This guy even goes so far as to say that Columbine-style killings happen all around the World every day. That's totally f***ed up. I must be reading the wrong newspapers.Other gems among BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE's many highlights is the finale where Moore goes one on one with Charlton Heston, who held a gun rally before the dust had settled on the Columbine Massacre, which makes his battle cry of ""From my cold dead hand!"" all the more disturbing.  Heston also admits to leaving loaded guns lying around his house where his grandkids can get at them. His feeble assertion is ""They know not to touch"". How did this guy win an Oscar? Heston winds up looking like a right plonker in the end.Also interviewed are Marilyn Manson, who channelled his demons into music; & South Park co-creater Matt Stone, who worked his frustration at growing up in a small town into comedy; as opposed to them shooting up their schools. While we're on that subject, there's a frightening clip of a schoolkid  pulling A DOZEN guns he's had concealed in his baggy pants. Jeez!Meanwhile, all the bible thumpers are blaming cartoons, Satan, toys, heavy metal, movies (!SPCS!) and Marilyn Manson (Who is actually a very intelligent guy. Maybe HE should run for President?). These clowns are just bad[].There's also a funny animated sequence about the pilgrims & linking the NRA to the KKK, slavery and witch hunts.While watching this I found within my personal views conflicting ideals. And yes, I'll openly admit a little hypocrisy. At least I can admit it. BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is a movie that can be dissected and analysed and interpreted in countless different ways.

739203,A34PAZQ73SL163,B00008DDVU,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[27, 47]","In the spirit of, ""I'll suffer so you don't have to,"" I decided to rent Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine yesterday.  After the filmmaker's regal reception at the Democratic Party convention, where he was seated next to President Carter, I realized that not bothering to view his works would forever hamper my ability to defeat his positions. What I saw was more horrifying (and boring) than I ever expected.  This movie won countless awards and is loved thousands of people but it amounts to little more than the enactment of one cheap emotional stunt after another.Moore is the star of the film and we unfortunately are subjected to his lumbering, dour, guilt-racked frame in shot after shot.  He is constantly lead-faced and saddened; appalled and unflinching.  He will go to any length to uncover the truth-provided he doesn't have to deal with clever people who may disagree with him.Moore's outlook is the embodiment of the Manichean worldview.  There are no grays or even light browns in his work.  He divides society into victims and oppressors and, just as we see every day on the talk shows, he pulls victims out of his hat and films confrontations with their accusers.  The result is a fruitcake drenched in emotional hysteria.This film is a triumph of emotion over reason.  There are no facts except those that Moore can twist within the confines of his theories.  It is the glorification of the sixties ethos, ""The issue is not the issue.""  What else is there then?  When somebody is shot, it can never be a result of the shooter's emotional state, it must always be the fault of outside nefarious influences.  It was a nearby Lockheed-Martin plant that was to blame or a nearby plutonium plant or the towering shadow of the Air Force Academy.The real monster ex machina in Bowling for Columbine is not a gun but another mechanism for self-defense known as the United States of America.  Moore regards us as being wholly inferior to other nations.  If only we could be more like Canada then our problems would be solved.  There, life is a socialist paradise.  People don't lock their doors and the criminals who enter only take a couple of things and then merrily go on their way.  The director knows this is the truth not through any statistical analysis but due to his interviews with adults in a Sarnia bar and with some kids outside a Taco Bell.  Why should he have to study the matter when such experts are readily available?  Anyway, Moore regards Ottawa's free health care system as the epitome of heaven on earth;  although he never inquires as to how long they have to wait for their MRIs or how many people there flood the borders whenever they experience a serious health crisis.  Canada's health care system is a joke and only a detached elitist like Michael Moore would be uneducated enough to regard socialism as being anything other than the acrid, gelatinous mess that it is.Yet, for this viewer, there is nothing as foul and evil about Bowling for Columbine than its incessant race baiting.  A short cartoon tells the history of the United States and we discover that our past is merely one long parade of racism against blacks.  It's all whitey's fault.  There are no individuals on this earth, only varying hues of pigmentation.  One gets the feeling from his films that whenever he runs out of things to say that he decides to foment a race war.  As in Fahrenheit 9/11, his attempts to foster paranoia within the black community will likely never end.  He postulates that white fear is the motivating factor behind gun ownership.  Then he implies that the Second Amendment was written exclusively for the benefit of white men which is a blatant lie.  More canards are offered such as the risible claim that the NRA is the direct descendent of the Ku Klux Klan and that they, like the Klan, were formed to subjugate blacks.  That the first NRA President was a former Union General is an extraneous fact apparently.  Michael Moore is a man incapable of simply responding to what is so he must fabricate events in order to have anything meaningful to say about them.Personally, I recommend seeing this film because conservatives in this country need to know what we're up against.  On display here is the soul of a truly sick man whom many of the young hail as a conquering hero.  Michael Moore is a racialist in the tradition of the Nazis, the Imperial Japanese, the Klan and the Black Panthers.  Like with many other leftists, racism is at the root of most of what he says.  To Moore, white is synonymous with evil and black is synonymous with good.  Whites fear blacks because we are all cowards; whereas all blacks are brave. Whites flee to the suburbs and hole up with their guns awaiting a siege.  So then what do we make of white people like me who live in the city?  What about all the black Americans who own guns?  Moore must attribute it to our false consciousness I suppose.  This filmmaker has nothing but disdain for his home state of Michigan, nothing but bile for his nation, and nothing but derision for those who share his skin color.  Bowling for Columbine is not a documentary.  It is a profile of an individual's inner-hate projected upon the world around him.",1,The Texture of Hate.,1099785600,"11 7, 2004",2004,5215,"['spirit', ""'ll"", 'suffer', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'have',

739205,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00008DDVU,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[1, 4]","This is the best treatment of the gun control issue which you could ever hope to see.  Although Michael Moore is rightly considered a far-left liberal, he is by no means anti-gun (he grew up in Flint, Michigan and is himself a lifetime member of the NRA), and his movie does not so much blame guns as view them as one small piece of a larger problem.  Other aspects of this issue that are highlighted in the film include the climate of fear created and aggravated by the US media; the failure of the US to provide adequate social services to the poor (we see a single mother who is forced to commute several hours a day in a impossible struggle to make ends meet); the ridiculously easy access to ammunition for handguns (Moore portrays the successful efforts of several Columbine survivors who petition K-Mart to ban the sale of these bullets); and, of course, the pathetic and self-serving rhetoric of the NRA (illustrated through an unbelievable and often hilarious interview with NRA president Charleton Heston).Moore's in-your-face film-making technique is brilliant; his disarming, Lt. Columbo-like manner results in startling statements by his subjects--for example, the brother of Terry Nichols, convicted Oklahoma City conspirator, saying that access to weapons-grade Plutonium should be restricted because ""there are crazy people out there""; Charleton Heston insisting on his right to bear arms but admitting that he does not need the many loaded guns in his home for protection, etc.  Moore asks all the right questions in a variety of situations, from trying to get Dick Clark on the record to quizzing Canadians about their low homicide numbers to interviewing Marilyn Manson (who offers a surprisingly serious, thoughtful, and intelligent perspective).Moore also does an incredible job of balancing humor--ie, an animated look at the history of America from the creators of South Park--with horror--namely, the raw video footage from the Columbine masscre.

739206,A1MR1VMK999I6O,B00008DDVU,"Beth DeRoos ""Beth DeRoos from the California ...","[4, 9]","Bowling for Columbine isn't a movie I planned on watching, much less owning, in large part because of how Mr. Moore has come off in media interviews I have watched.  He often makes me wince.  But I wanted to be fair, so I got the movie and while there are parts that bothered me, overall the movie is excellent!!What I liked or appreciated about the movie, was the overall fairness, which I will note the TV and print media hasn't shown very much. Which is one reason I assumed it was an anti-gun movie, which it is not.The movies value for me was or is, the historical over view of how fear is used to scare Americans into thinking that people with darker skin, or some unseen bad person is waiting outside our homes for the right time to hurt us.  And how mythical fear is used to sell goods from guns to security systems, to selling candidates who then sell the citizens on some unseen boogie man who wants to rob us of our country.  Thing is, its the people doing the selling that are also doing the robbing.  Sort of like the arsonist who then runs to help put out the fire they started that has hurt and killed people.One positive piece in the movie is the segment on K-Mart.  I applaud K-Mart for meeting with Mr. Moore and the two young men from Columbine who were shot and maimed (one disabled for life), and for making the wise decision not to sell guns and ammo anymore.William Hares review is one I agree with too.  And I was shocked at how Dick Clark treated Mr. Moore who was being so nice and simply wanted to know how this squeaky clean image of Dick Clark is so foreign from what I see as reality.  He owns a string of big business restaurants and pays lousy wages and demanded take breaks to boot, because he hired poor single welfare mothers who had to travel sixty miles one way to work, and for pay that didn't support their family.  Often getting home late and unable to pay for childcare.  One of Dick Clarks workers was a young mother whose child was killed by another child.  Had Clark paid a decent wage the mother would have been home when her child was home.And its a great movie for anyone who wants to be reminded of how America has bred guns and violence outside our own borders and how we may have a great Constitution and Bill of rights but our leaders have not or are not the peace loving people they may want us to believe.  And YES Mr. Moore was/is critical of G W Bush and his war in Iraq.  But Mr. Moore is also very hard on Clinton and his wars while in office!

You either loathe him or love him.  I, being a fence sitter by nature, like some of his stuff and hate other stuff.  The way I look at is this: if you honestly don't even consider the questions that his films bring up about our society, you are too conservative and if you don't question the information he gives, the editing of the interviews and clips or his &quot;spin&quot; on the facts you're too liberal.  As far as the movie aspects of it go, Moore tries to keep interest going throughout the two hours plus, and is largely successful;  but there are about about a billion different tangents that he digresses on throughout the film and it distracts from the overall thrust of the film (if you've seen it you know what I'm talking about).  For instance, Moore goes into a video montage of various dictators that the US has supported over the past half century with no reference to any of the situations that accompanied each of them.  Moore apparently thinks that all foreign policy is like a philosophy seminar, where there's a good choice and a bad choice and the choice is always clear cut.  That's nice in theory, but in the real world its often between the bad guy and the really bad guy.

Then, my beloved brought it home. We watched it together and I completely flipped! Michael Moore is a film-making genius! His guerilla style is perfectly suited for the subject matter. Who else has even attempted to ask the question &quot;Why so much fear and violence in america?&quot; without finding simplistic, kneejerk answers? Moore takes us to Columbine to not only relive the tragedy, but to talk with the surviving victims. He even takes them to K Mart's HQ to confront the company's policy of selling handgun ammo (the columbine shooters purchased their bullets at the local k mart) with successful results. This is not just some propoganda film about the evils of gun ownership. Moore himself was raised with guns and still carries his NRA membership card. This movie is about Moore's quest to find out why we love to kill each other so much here in the states. Is it poverty? Nope, other countries have worse economic problems without the bloodletting. Is it violent music or video games? Uh-uh, these are endemic throughout the civilized world. Could it be the proliferation of handguns? No, Canada has millions of guns and it's big cities have the murder rates of our small towns! Is it our violent, gun-toting history? Negative, the entire planet has a bloody, violent past. Moore has the audacity to try to get to the bottom of this mess. BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is not for the squeamish or the political zealot from either right or left. It's for folks who wonder at what we've become. It's for people like me who hate the idea of barracading themselves in their homes for fear of being slaughtered. This fear is also challenged here.

But because there's a chord that this documentary struck that seemed to set Americans (and maybe others) against each other. Some have called this a &quot;fictional documentary&quot;, or tried to blast it for being unpatriotic or anti-gun. Other's have said that it's an instant American classic that speaks volumes about the current psychology of the masses in the USA. I'm kind of in the middle. . .The film--as the title suggests--focuses primarily on the school shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado; two teenagers barging into classrooms and the cafeteria, killing any who got in their way. Michael Moore (the star, narrator, director and producer) doesn't say &quot;These boys had guns and if they didn't have them those poor kids at Columbine would still be alive today.&quot; What he DOES say is that there's an inherent fear factor that has oozed into the American mainstream and invaded our homes. And this fear has spilled over to our kids as they see us go off to work for companies that build missiles (&quot;For Defense&quot;), handguns, semi-automatic weapons, and fully automatic weapons (&quot;For Home Defense&quot;), and security features for our homes (&quot;Burglar Alarms and New Locks&quot;). Mr. Moore also shows us that Canadians don't seem to have as much of a problem as their southern neighbor. Canadians don't lock their doors, or focus on shootings on CNN, or run out to buy a gun every time something bad happens in their area.Why is that?This documentary opens up new dialogue for parents raising teens, I think. And it should open up their own minds, making them wonder why they have to &quot;defend&quot; themselves so fervently from the unknown.I have a unique insight into school shootings, as I was a paramedic for many years and was in one of the first ambulances to arrive at the Cleveland School shooting in Stockton, California. 35 elementary school children were hit by bullets from an AK-47 rifle. A horrible sight that I never wish to see again, and that I sometimes still dream about (believe me, you don't want these nightmares). Even after witnessing this horror and seeing the gun laying on the ground near Mr. Purdy's body (the shooter), I still believe that Americans have the right to &quot;bare arms.&quot; But not AK-47's and the like.

I thought I'd revisit it and review this movie, that many of my European friends make references too.  I recall vaguely how moved I was when I first viewed it myself in 2002Okay, while watching this movie, I kept asking myself - What is this movie about?  Columbine high school massacre, American imperialism, gun control, American history, 9/11, Y2K, fear and mass media, Africanised bees, racism, LA riots of 93, life in Canada, low income jobs,  The movie's show of sarcasm can be quite entertaining and can drive the points home very fast, but there is no one unifying theme.Michael Moor, the director, tends to either make people love him or hate him and his works.  I think it is important not to make the logical fallacy mistake and do a character assassination just because we disagree with one's work or art.  While I appreciate the director's skill at splicing and mixing, I felt that what he offered the viewer was his own prejudices, biases, and counter-propaganda.  As a scientist, I could easily debunk the presentation of # of crimes statistic for various western countries (the presentation did no mention anything about %age or how it relates to total population).  Also the history lesson, was riddled with subjective terse summaries, and selective evidence.  Michael Moore comes across as a liberal, but a caring one, caring for the wellbeing of disadvantaged, disenfranchised, marginalized, poor people of the USA.While the director does a good job at putting together a collage of thought provoking and entertaining shots, he also presents in a very sly way a contrast, and even hypocritical view that the US society views crimes, and weapons.  At times the movie feels like a propaganda machine.  The director is showing and editing only the clips he wants the viewer to see.  I had a hard time coming up with a theme for the whole movie.  There are quite a lot of themes.

And while I do not dispute the man's right to hold whatever opinions he wants, I think this film is filled with many factual errors, baseless and politically-motivated assertions, and does not in fact deserve the title of 'documentary'.  Rather, it's a propoganda piece, a kind of cinematic grinding axe, wherein Moore launches into soft-spoken yet clearly enraged tirades against a range of targets, capping it all off with an ambush on Charlton Heston.  Balance?  Dispassion?  Critical analysis?  What are those?  Moore doesn't seem to know, nor does he seem to care.  I recommend this film for all capital 'L' Leftists, who will surely adore it because it basically says nothing they haven't been saying for a long time anyway.  The rest of us who live in reality have better things to do with our time than let Moore occupy it with his films.Oh yes.

739216,A26PAN8REXYBYH,B00008DDVU,"Brian M. Ranzoni ""Da Killa B""","[5, 11]","Americans have not seemed more politically polarized in my lifetime than now. It seems like all our current concerns have come to a boiling head. Over it all wafts the smoke of the World Trade Center.This shadow hasn't blanketed controversy. We stir it in with everything that made us mad before. Some interesting works result.Michael Moore's 2002 film *Bowling for Columbine* exemplifies the current mix of argument. Controversial in his own right, Moore examines modern American violence in a sort of cross-country adventure. And now his vision is available in a special edition DVD from MGM Home Entertainment.Shine the BallMGM's release provides plenty of extra pieces to peruse. The transfer and sound brings justice to Moore's journey about the lack of justice. Special features include Moore criticizing Republicans for attacking former President Clinton instead of preventing the September 11th attacks. Viewers also get to hear people lower on the filmmaking ladder provide a commentary; Moore's interns mostly provide little stories like being locked inside Charlton Heston's estate. The case insert is your standard scene selection card.StrikeDespite its titular reference to the 1999 Columbine High School tragedy, *Bowling for Columbine* is not about school shootings. And despite its byline, ""Are we a nation of gun nuts or are we just nuts?"", it's not about guns. Instead, Moore launches a methodical attack against corporate conceit and social inequity, which he repeatedly implies are the sources of violence in America.True, Moore discusses guns in detail at first. For example, he interviews a relative of Timothy McVeigh about guns, and he examines not only the Columbine tragedy, but another infamous incident in Michigan, when a preschool boy shot a preschool girl. But Moore's gun interviews lead into an analysis of Canada, a nation with plenty of private firearms but a fraction of the violence. His Columbine interviews lead to discussion of the major defense industries located right in Littleton, Colorado. And his visit to Michigan concludes with a memorable confrontation with Dick Clark, one of several celebrities who use ""Welfare to Work"" for menial labor-including the mother of the aforementioned boy.Moore's implied concern against corporations and conservative government continue with brief examinations of the September 11th terror attacks, America's own history of terrorism, and America's fear-instilling media. Moore breaks his theme only in the final five scenes, when he tacks on a dramatic but contradictory attack against guns.Rules of the Game*Bowling for Columbine* passes as a documentary. To me, a documentary is a visual research report. Documentaries provide information, but do not pass judgment and do not draw conclusions. The Vietnam War film *Hearts and Minds* exemplifies a great documentary.Throughout most of *BfC*, Moore implies his opinions. He's obviously critical of conservatives, but he simply gives them rope to hang themselves.  But in the last 20 minutes of the film, Moore advances an explicit argument, a specific solution, and he passes out judgment like a cop passing out tickets on Memorial Day Weekend. These attributes convert Bowling for Columbine from an informative exposition to a persuasive-policy exposition, and the latter is not a documentary!Gutter ShotThis doesn't spoil my enjoyment of *BfC*. Unfortunately, its ending does. After spending the film dealing in ambiguity and complexity, Moore suddenly decides that gun control is the answer after all. Besides contradicting much of his film, Moore's final Act befits tabloid journalism.Moore parades Columbine survivors to pressure K-Mart into banning handgun ammunition from their inventory. The group even buys as much ammunition as they can, ostensibly so nobody else can get it. Once K-mart caves in, Moore tells reporters he is doing his part to reduce gun violence. This K-Mart scene suggests that targeting guns will reduce violence, contradicting his own point that nations like Canada are heavily armed but experience relatively low death rates.It also explains why I couldn't buy ammunition when I was stationed in El Centro, CA. Kmart and Wal-Mart were the only game in town; I and every other police officer in the area had to scrounge for enough ammunition to properly train for our jobs. I don't know if banning ammunition from Kmart saved lives, but it sure interfered with civilian and federal law enforcement training.After this segment, Moore confronts NRA president Charlton Heston in the film's climax. At first, Moore seems reasonable. Then he attacks Heston's pride with increasingly inflammatory questions. Heston walks out after Moore indirectly insults him. Moore pursues Heston and, in perhaps the most tactless scene of the movie, goads the aging president with a picture of the preschool shooting victim.Finally, Moore concludes with an ominous implication of continued gun violence, playing right into the fear-based media he disparaged not an hour before.I'm sure it's exciting to see the hip young liberal chase the mean old Republicans away. Such emotional provocations doubtlessly sealed Moore's Oscar award. To me, the K-Mart and Heston confrontations inflated Moore's reputation, while contradicting his own film and punishing non-criminals. The shock value of his climax might make his movie memorable, but also dishonest.End ScoreMoore's ambiguity had me in the palm of his hand for most of the film. I'm pleased he built his film on interview and news clips, showing instead of lecturing. Most of the film works, and it works best when Moore puts institutions on the spot.But he lost his grip in the end, when he witnessed to the gun control choir. In doing so, Moore banks into the same gutter that traps most of America's post 9/11/01 media. He preaches a party-line and pushes others away.*Bowling for Columbine* often strikes. But it will ultimately split people who should be working together. That Moore should slip like this so late in an otherwise excellent film is too frustrating to articulate.",3,Bowling Over Republicans,1072224000,"12 24, 2003",2003,6078,"['Americans', 'have', 'not',

My guess is, that at some stage, people are going to be onto him. The segment with Charlton Heston is the most glaring case-in-point. He hounds Heston's people for an interview, finally gets some camera time with him and then totally submarines the man. I guess he's counting on Heston's having joined the Ronald Reagan Lost Recall Brigade. How else could Heston not have known going into the interview of Moore's muckraking past? Might it have had something to do with Moore's positioning himself as a longtime NRA, card carrying member, an undying gun enthusiast? Is that not at least a middling form of dissembling and misinformation (which Moore accuses his opponents of doing?).I'm not by any means a fan of the NRA. The fact that Heston went ahead with those rallies in Denver and Michigan is despicable. I'm just not into filmmakers' engaging in dishonest subterfuges in hopes of getting someone to look bad on camera. I'd also have to add that the guy can at least think on his feet. When his big crusade against K-Mart towards the end of the film entirely fizzles, when big, bad, corporate K-Mart shows it has a human heart, Moore parades about and lauds himself in one of the most self-aggrandizing displays I've ever seen on film .

739221,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00008DDVU,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[4, 9]","Bowling for Columbine is an interesting documentary that attempts to answer questions about the American culture of violence. It won an academy award for its director, Michael Moore. And while it does make you think, it also leaves much open for further debate.The documentary is subtitled ""are we a bunch of gun nuts or are we just nuts""? It shows how Americans seem to be obsessed with violence and taking revenge on others in a violent manner when we feel we have been wronged. But its attempts to draw connections between different cultural links leaves more questions unanswered than answered. For example, many critics have claimed that the number of guns in America is the reason for the violence. But as the documentary points out, Canada also has a large number of guns and there are not nearly as many deaths attributable to guns in that country. Critics have also tried to blame other things for violence, like specific types of music, video games, etc. But under closer scrutiny, the documentary cannot find any correlation here, either.Several different celebrities make appearances in this documentary, like Dick Clark, Charlton Heston, and others. One of the documentary's best moments comes when Moore is interviewing rocker Marilyn Manson, a guy who many parents tried to blame for the shooting deaths at Columbine. When asked what he would have done to help stop the kids from committing these violent acts, Manson replies that he wouldn't have done anything- he would have just listened to them, which is obviously something the parents of the kids and other people close to them failed to do.Overall, this documentary has its moments. Moore presents his take on things, and he adds some elements of humor from time to time.

739222,A2OTX4X3895YXT,B00008DDVU,BuyCurious,"[8, 15]","Michael Moore's latest is engaging cinema, to say the least. His sarcastic, ultra-liberal approach to &quot;the awful truths&quot; of America have never been so entertaining. It's a cross between Candid Camera and 60 Minutes.This time, he confronts the gun-culture of America. He highlights the fact that Charleton Heston and his merry band of pro-gun extremists held a rally near Columbine shortly after the tragedy there. Then, he and his ilk held ANOTHER gun-rally shortly after another child/gun tragedy in Flint, MI where a 6-year old child shot and killed a 6-year old classmate (Heston claims in the final interview of the film that he didn't know this had just happened when he appeared in Flint). Heston really shines when he claims that the reason for all of the violence in America is due to &quot;mixed ethnicity&quot;. This statement is almost as jaw-dropping as Bob Eubanks' anti-semetic joke in Moore's debut, &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot;, unless of course, you are a bigot.Also interviewed, and similarly pathetic, is James Nichols, brother of Terry Nichols and friend of Timothy McVeigh, both convicted in the Oklahoma City bombing. James, of course, is pro-gun, but doesn't believe the right to bear arms includes nuclear weapons (&quot;There are a lot of nuts out there,&quot; he claims, to the howling delight of the audience).Marilyn Manson pops up also, commenting on how he was also blamed for Columbine because the idiots that killed at Columbine listened to his music.Another highlight is when Michael invites two Columbine survivors to join him at the K-mart headquarters in Troy, MI, to &quot;return the bullets&quot; that are still embedded in their flesh from the Columbine attack (reportedly purchased from the local K-mart). This stunt results in K-mart's announcement that they will be pulling ammunition off of their shelves, to Moore's own astonishment.Although there is a lot of serious business in the movie, it is packaged with enough laugh-out-loud footage to make it bearable, even entertaining, even in light of the constant barrage of violence played out on nightly newscasts.The only major downside is Moore's lack of thoroughness in certain areas. For instance, he claims Canada has as many guns as we do in America, and therefore the death-by-gun rate should be the same (of course Canada has FAR fewer gun-related deaths than the U.S.). However, Canada bans handgun ownership. This is not pointed out.Also, he tries to blame Michigan's &quot;Welfare to Work&quot; program for the classroom shooting of the 6-year old child, his claim being that because the mother of the shooter had to work far from home (via bussing), she had to leave her children in the care of her brother, who owned the gun that the child found and brought to school. This is a stretch, as when he also blames General Motors for this tragedy, inferring that it was because GM ruined Flint, MI that this tragedy occured. These tangents, although interesting, often seem somewhat scattershot.There are other flaws as well, and many will depend on your viewpoint, but no matter what you think about Michael Moore or gun control, this movie is funny, thought-provoking and will stick with you awhile.",4,Flawed but Hilarious,1070236800,"12 1, 2003",2003,3211,"['Michael', 'Moore', 'latest', 'engaging', 'cinema', 'say', 'least', 'sarcastic', 'ultra-liberal', 'approach', 'quot', 'awful', 'truths', 'quot', 'America', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'entertaining', 'cross', 'Candid', 'Camera', '60', 'Minutes.This', 'time', 'gun-culture', 'America', 'fact', 'Charleton', 'Heston', 'merry', 'band', 'pro-gun', 'extremists', 'held', 'rally', 'Columbine', 'shortly', 'tragedy', 'there', 'Then', 'ilk', 'held', 'ANOTHER', 'gun-rally', 'shortly', 'child/gun', 'tragedy', 'Flint', 'MI', 'where', '6-year', 'old', 'child', 'shot', 'killed', '6-year', 'old', 'classmate', 'Heston', 'final', 'interview', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'just', 'happened', 'when', 'appeared', 'Flint', 'Heston', 'really', 'when', 'reason', 'violence', 'America', 'due', 'quot', 'mixed', 'ethnicity', 'quot', 'statement', 'almost', 'as', 'jaw-dropping', 'Bob', 'Eubanks', 'anti-semetic', 'joke', 'Moore', 'debut', 'quot', 'Roger', 'amp', 'Me', 'quot', 'course', 'are', 'bigot.Also', 'interviewed', 'similarly', 'pathetic', 'James', 'Nichols', 'brother', 'Terry', 'Nichols', 'friend', 'Timothy', 'McVeigh', 'convicted', 'Oklahoma', 'City', 'bombing', 'James', 'course', 'pro-gun', ""n't"", 'believe', 'right', 'bear', 'arms', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'quot', 'are', 'lot', 'nuts', 'there', 'quot', 'howling', 'delight', 'audience', 'Manson', 'up', 'also', 'commenting', 'how', 'was', 'also', 'blamed', 'Columbine', 'idiots', 'killed', 'Columbine', 'listened', 'music.Another', 'highlight', 'when', 'Michael', 'two', 'Columbine', 'survivors', 'join', 'K-mart', 'headquarters', 'Troy', 'MI', 'quot', 'return', 'bullets', 'quot', 'are', 'still', 'embedded', 'flesh', 'Columbine', 'attack', 'reportedly', 'purchased', 'local', 'K-mart', 'stunt', 'results', 'K-mart', 'announcement', 'will', 'be', 'pulling', 'ammunition', 'shelves', 'Moore', 'own', 'astonishment.Although', 'lot', 'serious', 'business', 'movie', 'packaged', 'enough', 'laugh-out-loud', 'footage', 'make', 'bearable', 'even', 'entertaining', 'even', 'light', 'constant', 'barrage', 'violence', 'played', 'out', 'nightly', 'newscasts.The', 'only', 'major', 'downside', 'Moore', 'lack', 'thoroughness', 'certain', 'areas', 'instance', 'Canada', 'as', 'many', 'guns', 'do', 'America', 'therefore', 'death-by-gun', 'rate', 'should', 'be', 'same', 'course', 'Canada', 'FAR', 'fewer', 'gun-related', 'deaths', 'U.S.', 'However', 'Canada', 'handgun', 'ownership', 'not', 'pointed', 'out.Also', 'blame', 'Michigan', 'quot', 'Welfare', 'Work', 'quot', 'program', 'classroom', 'shooting', '6-year', 'old', 'child', 'claim', 'being', 'mother', 'shooter', 'had', 'work', 'far', 'home', 'bussing', 'had', 'leave', 'children', 'care', 'brother', 'who', 'owned', 'gun', 'child', 'found', 'brought', 'school', 'stretch', 'when', 'also', 'General', 'Motors', 'tragedy', 'inferring', 'was', 'GM', 'ruined', 'Flint', 'MI', 'tragedy', 'occured', 'tangents', 'interesting', 'often', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'scattershot.There', 'are', 'other', 'flaws', 'well', 'many', 'will', 'depend', 'viewpoint', 'matter', 'what', 'think', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'gun', 'control', 'movie', 'funny', 'thought-provoking', 'will', 'stick', 'awhile']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

But let me add that Michael lies routinely -- even under oath. I will start this discussion by arguing that ""oligophrenic"" hardly seems like a strong enough word to describe Michael. Then, I will present evidence that Michael is unable to support his assertions with documentation of any sort. Once we realize that, what do we do? The appropriate thing, in my judgment, is to clarify and correct some of the inaccuracies present in Michael's canards. I say that because to believe that he is the ultimate authority on what's right and what's wrong is to deceive ourselves. Ancient Greek dramatists discerned a peculiar virtue in being tragic. Michael would do well to realize that they never discerned any virtue in being unconscionable.Michael's rejoinders are like an enormous barbarism-spewing machine. We must begin dismantling that structure. We must put a monkey wrench in its gears. And we must improve the physical and spiritual quality of life for the population at present and for those yet to come, because Michael has a one-track mind. That's clear.

""ccjello""","[5, 10]","This is a fascinating and disturbing look at gun violence in the United States, using the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, as a starting point.  There are places where Moore's biases come through loud & clear, but at most points in the film, Moore creates questions rather than prescribes cures.  I was expecting a film-length pitch for gun control, but the film delivered something very different.  I'm not sure what Moore's thesis is -- but the question posed is why does the United States have such horrific statistics on shooting homicides?  The statistics are alarming -- our statistics are orders of magnitude greater than those of other developed countries.  According to the film, Canada, England, & Germany have virtually no gun homicides, while the US has over 11000 a year (and in Canada, about 70% of homes have a gun).  Moore doesn't give pat answers -- violence on TV, our propensity towward military intervention abroad, heightened coverage of violence in news media that creates a culture of fear, exposure to guns at a young age, the proximity of missile-producing Lockheed Martin to Columbine, poverty -- who knows why American society is so violent??  Apparently, the Columbine shooters were enrolled in a Bowling phys ed class & went bowling on the morning of the shootings -- Moore sarcastically questions why bowling isn't blamed as a cause of the shootings.  Moore even explores a situation in which a six-year old boy shot & killed a classmate at his elementary school in Michigan, leading him to interview bus passengers on the bus ridden by the young shooter's mother, leading in turn to a pointed criticism of Michigan's welfare to work program.Much about this film is disturbing --  footage of the shootings at Columbine, footage of executions in US-sanctioned military and police actions throughout history made me squirm.  And I was very uncomfortable during Moore's confrontations with K-Mart (who sold the ammunication used at Columbine), Charlton Heston (for his visit to Denver with the NRA shortly after the Columbine shootings), and Dick Clark (whom moore attempted to interview because the six-year-old shooter's mother was employed at a Dick Clark's Bandstand restaurant under Michigan's welfare-to-work program -- seems to stray a little off point).

Making the point that Canada has as many guns as we do, Michael Moore concedes that they do not have the crime level that we do. The reason we do, he points out, is the focus this country has on power, dominance, and violence -- through our media, our methods of crime control, and our interactions with the world. None of it is effective, and all of it creates more harm than it heals. It is the American focus on the power of violence that is at the roots of our dilemma -- that, and a history of power and control and manipulation of our children that Moore is either not aware of or does not go into. That's okay. His body of work involves more investigative reporting than I have seen in my lifetime. It was the mainstream media that immediately began talking about gun control in the wake of Columbine, smacking of the Hegelian dialectic. No mass media outlet started talking about controlling their own violent imagery. Let me quickly state that Michael Moore is not advocating censorship -- for an investigative journalist, that would be foolish. What he is advocating is responsible journalism -- something that seems to have gone the way of the dinosaur -- until one considers Jon Stewart.

Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter""","[38, 57]","Criticizing Entitlement to Fear, Violence, and MurderMichael Moore's caustic, and critically important documentary, ""Bowling For Columbine"" will outrage anyone with extremist attitudes about the United States and gun ownership, but will probably resonate with anyone who wants to know why so many Americans kill each other. While Moore is often labeled a leftist, this film is more practical than it is radical. Compelled to understand how and why incidents like the Columbine shootings took place, Moore examines America's longstanding preoccupation with crime, violence, and gun ownership, and he comes to some pretty surprising conclusions.Moore debunks many prevailing myths about the relationship between gun ownership and violence in America. Gun enthusiasts will be pleased to learn, according to Moore, that it is not easy access to firearms alone that results in so many gun deaths in America. After all, guns of all types are readily available in Canada where the murder rate per capita is far lower than the United States. In terms of America's violent history, Moore points out that nations with an arguably more violent history, including Germany, Japan, and Britain also have a far lower murder rate per capita than the United States. If you believe that the answer must be all of those violent movies and video games, then think again. Moore demonstrates that most developing nations, share America's enthusiasm for violent films and video games, but have a much smaller murder rate per capita. More even examines the assertion of several of his interviewees that it is minorities, particularly black people, who cause so much violent crime. Walking down the streets of Canadian cities, Moore demonstrates that they are as multiethnic as any major American city but hardly as violent. So why does America have a much higher rate of gun related murder and violence than the rest of the developed world?The answer, according to Moore, is fear. With the help of a hilarious but completely accurate cartoon, Moore demonstrates that from the moment of the Pilgrims' arrival, America was practically founded on fear. Unsurprisingly Moore also demonstrates how successfully the media--particularly televised news--and politicians profit from whipping up fear. As if this were not enough, Moore exposes some of the more outlandish things that popular culture and advertising instruct us to be afraid of such as escalators, prescription drugs, and African ""killer"" bees (the European ones are supposed to be OK). One can't help but remember Franklin Delano Roosevelt's famous declaration that Americans had nothing to fear but fear itself.Although ""Bowling for Columbine"" is riddled with humor, Moore never resorts to insulting his subjects, even if they seem bizarre. When interviewing members of the Michigan Militia, for example, he treats them with seriousness and respect. Similarly, when interviewing a security consultant in Littleton Colorado, Moore accords him dignity and respect when the detached and objective individual suddenly becomes emotional about the Columbine shootings. Even the supposedly scandalous parts of this film such as Moore's interviews with Kmart management, Dick Clark, and Charlton Heston involve no more than his simply showing them the end results of their beliefs and actions.It is fascinating to see this documentary in a theatre and to observe the audience's reaction. A friend saw this film in a mall theater with a mostly teenaged audience whom he was sure did not connect with it at all, yet when the film ended the Audience burst into applause. When I saw this film in an upper middle class theater, the older, more affluent audience simply sat stunned long after the last credit had passed. It seemed that having been exposed to a simple but well concealed truth they were now eager for some type of resolution, which, of course, the film could not deliver.",5,"Criticizing Entitlement to Fear, Violence, and Murder",1043712000,"01 28, 2003",2003,3907,"['Criticizing', 'Entitlement', 'Fear', 'Violence', 'MurderMichael', 'Moore', 'caustic', 'critically', 'important', 'documentary', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'will', 'outrage', 'anyone', 'extremist', 'attitudes', 'United', 'States', 'gun', 'ownership', 'will', 'probably', 'resonate', 'anyone', 'who', 'know', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'Americans', 'kill', 'other', 'Moore', 'often', 'labeled', 'leftist', 'film', 'more', 'practical', 'radical', 'Compelled', 'understand', 'how', 'why', 'incidents', 'Columbine', 'shootings', 'took', 'place', 'Moore', 'America', 'longstanding', 'preoccupation', 'crime', 'violence', 'gun', 'ownership', 'pretty', 'surprising', 'conclusions.Moore', 'debunks', 'many', 'prevailing', 'myths', 'relationship', 'gun', 'ownership', 'violence', 'America', 'Gun', 'enthusiasts', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'learn', 'according', 'Moore', 'not', 'easy', 'access', 'firearms', 'alone', 'results', 'so', 'many', 'gun', 'deaths', 'America', 'guns', 'types', 'are', 'readily', 'available', 'Canada', 'where', 'murder', 'rate', 'capita', 'far', 'lower', 'United', 'States', 'terms', 'America', 'violent', 'history', 'Moore', 'out', 'nations', 'arguably', 'more', 'violent', 'history', 'including', 'Germany', 'Japan', 'Britain', 'also', 'have', 'far', 'lower', 'murder', 'rate', 'capita', 'United', 'States', 'believe', 'answer', 'must', 'be', 'violent', 'movies', 'video', 'games', 'then', 'think', 'again', 'Moore', 'most', 'developing', 'nations', 'share', 'America', 'enthusiasm', 'violent', 'films', 'video', 'games', 'have', 'much', 'smaller', 'murder', 'rate', 'capita', 'More', 'even', 'assertion', 'several', 'interviewees', 'minorities', 'particularly', 'black', 'people', 'who', 'cause', 'so', 'much', 'violent', 'crime', 'Walking', 'down', 'streets', 'Canadian', 'cities', 'Moore', 'are', 'as', 'multiethnic', 'major', 'American', 'city', 'hardly', 'violent', 'So', 'why', 'America', 'have', 'much', 'higher', 'rate', 'gun', 'related', 'murder', 'violence', 'rest', 'developed', 'world', 'answer', 'according', 'Moore', 'fear', 'help', 'hilarious', 'completely', 'accurate', 'cartoon', 'Moore', 'moment', 'Pilgrims', 'arrival', 'America', 'was', 'practically', 'founded', 'fear', 'Unsurprisingly', 'Moore', 'also', 'how', 'successfully', 'media', 'particularly', 'televised', 'news', 'politicians', 'profit', 'whipping', 'up', 'fear', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'Moore', 'more', 'outlandish', 'things', 'popular', 'culture', 'advertising', 'instruct', 'be', 'afraid', 'such', 'escalators', 'prescription', 'drugs', 'African', 'killer', 'bees', 'European', 'ones', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'OK', 'One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'remember', 'Franklin', 'Delano', 'Roosevelt', 'famous', 'declaration', 'Americans', 'had', 'nothing', 'fear', 'fear', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'riddled', 'humor', 'Moore', 'never', 'insulting', 'subjects', 'even', 'seem', 'bizarre', 'When', 'interviewing', 'members', 'Michigan', 'Militia', 'example', 'seriousness', 'respect', 'Similarly', 'when', 'interviewing', 'security', 'consultant', 'Littleton', 'Colorado', 'Moore', 'dignity', 'respect', 'when', 'detached', 'objective', 'individual', 'suddenly', 'emotional', 'Columbine', 'shootings', 'Even', 'supposedly', 'scandalous', 'parts', 'film', 'such', 'Moore', 'interviews', 'Kmart', 'management', 'Dick', 'Clark', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'involve', 'more', 'simply', 'showing', 'end', 'results', 'beliefs', 'actions.It', 'fascinating', 'see', 'documentary', 'theatre', 'observe', 'audience', 'reaction', 'friend', 'saw', 'film', 'mall', 'theater', 'mostly', 'teenaged', 'audience', 'whom', 'was', 'sure', 'did', 'not', 'connect', 'yet', 'when', 'film', 'ended', 'Audience', 'burst', 'applause', 'When', 'saw', 'film', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'theater', 'older', 'more', 'affluent', 'audience', 'simply', 'sat', 'stunned', 'long', 'last', 'credit', 'had', 'passed', 'seemed', 'having', 'been', 'exposed', 'simple', 'well', 'concealed', 'truth', 'were', 'now', 'eager', 'type', 'resolution', 'course', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'deliver']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

Fry ""cgfry""","[4, 10]","Michael Moore has made a very moving, very well made documentary with &quot;Bowling for Columbine.&quot;  The story takes interesting twists and turns, and only after an hour or so will you see where Moore is headed.  He makes surprisingly effective and powerful statements about why such tragedies happen in the United States.  It will be a shame if people do not watch this movie simply because they disagree with Moore's obvious and blatant leftist politics; the emphasis on violence in the US is so much more important than political persuasion. Viewers should note that Moore is no kinder to Bill Clinton than he is to GW Bush.  Another big surprise in the movie is a brilliant interview Moore has with Marilyn Manson.  Look in particular for Manson's answer to what he would want say to Columbine students.For those that wonder about Moore, and whether his &quot;common man&quot; approach is for real or not, some of the extra features on the DVD should resolve their doubts.  His recounting of his &quot;Oscar experience,&quot; and another extra showing portions of his first return to Denver following Columbine, are excellent.Bowling for Columbine addresses a number of very important issues in the US.  At the same time, it is alternately funny, serious, important, discouraging, and depressing; but most important, it will make you think.

739231,A29IYGR7SNPRIV,B00008DDVU,"Charlotte Vale-Allen ""writerinresidence""","[34, 49]","There hasn't been a documentary or a book Moore has done that I haven't liked. Bowling for Columbine is a bittersweet, humorous and, at the same time, upsetting commentary on guns and killing in America. Without stridency, Moore accomplishes this via stock footage, via interviews (notably with one of the Columbine alumnae who happens to be half of the South Park creative team) and through an effort to place an historical frame around the ""killingness"" of the American psyche.Particularly alarming are an attempted interview with Dick Clark--owner of a Michigan eatery where the mother of a six-year-old (who shot and killed a six-year-old classmate with his uncle's handgun) works. This eatery has applied for tax credits for hiring welfare-to-work employees (only a little obscene, this request for subsidy for underpaid employees). Clark blows Moore off with no pretense of manners or grace. Scary stuff. Even scarier is Moore's sit-down interview with Charlton (call me Chuck) Heston, larger-than-life long-term walking, talking symbol of the NRA. Spouting propaganda and refusing even to discuss anything other than ""every American's right to bear arms,"" Heston is old, shambling and rigidly inarticulate. He is emblematic of so many of the gun-toting people Moore speaks with in the course of the film.The title, derived from the fact that the two Columbine shooters were on the school's bowling team (a credited part of the sports curriculum) and possibly bowled a couple of games the morning they attacked their fellow students, is at once amusing and, on a deeper level, alarming. When schools start giving credit for bowling, we're in trouble. When heavily armed kids enter a school and shoot other kids at random before taking their own lives, we're in serious trouble.Using relatively non-violent Canada as an example (among many) of countries with gun-related death rates that don't even register on the American scale is slightly misleading. While it's true that my native Canada has a relatively low murder rate, the societal reasons why are never satisfactorily answered. Still, this film is, to all intents and purposes, a mirror held up to reflect pervasive American attitudes that are rooted in fear; about a media that thrives on bloodshed, and a society that has been taught to fear those who are ""different"": people of color, ethnicity, or  sexual preference.This is an important, thoughtful, good-humored, and heartstring-tugging film.

739234,A1B4NBFZJY2FIZ,B00008DDVU,Chris Fung,"[30, 42]","The genius of Michael Moore is not that he makes you laugh (even Adam Sandler can do that!), but that he makes you think after you laugh. Certainly this is not a guffaw-fest, anyone familiar with Moore's work can tell you that his work is fueled by outrage as much as it is by humor.But despite its unfortunate marketing as a ""hilarious"" film, this is an important movie to see. In fact I would say that everyone in high school and college (and all of you who are beyond that too) should go see this movie. Forget learning about the seperation of powers, this movie should be required viewing for every single class on civics, political science, anthropology and sociology.There's a certain naivete to the views of those who argue that Moore shouldn't have ""ambushed"" K-Mart, Charleton Heston or Dick Clark and that he overplayed the role of racism in US society. First of all, Moore tried unsucessfully for two whole years to get a sit-down interview with Heston. The tactic of turning up at his house (using a Hollywood Map of the Homes of the Stars) was a desperate last-minute tactic. Anyone who has tried to get a straight answer from a powerful corporation or individual with publicists, assistants and ""communications directors"" will know that you will only get a straight answer when it suits THEM and never when it only suits you. Sound paranoid? Just try calling your local HMO.With regard to the racism. Maybe Moore was being a bit glib (ditto his laundry list of US foreign policy disasters -all of which are extensively documented by the way by non-partisan groups such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and by reputable right and left-wing academics -and I don't just mean Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky although I have no quarrel with them-, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Guardian, Le Monde, and even the Frankfurter Allgemeine). But the essence of his argument is sound.Racial hierarchy in this country was and is structured by fear. Before the Civil Rights movement, this fear and intimidation was aimed by groups of white people at black people (e.g. the Klan). After the 1950s, this fear was increasingly fostered (often unconsciously or semi-consiously) among white people. The South Park style cartoons were a bit heavy handed but they were probably a better creative choice than some boring academic sitting in an office, and you would NEVER have gotten people to say stuff on camera because they know its not cool to go there. But they say it, you all know (if you're Euro-american) because you've heard them say it around you, if not directly to you.Likewise fear keeps people (both black and white) from interacting with one another as equals. It may not be ""fear for my life"" type fear but there is a sense of social distance which is the legacy of this fear that ultimately paralyzes the undoubted goodwill that most people have towards one another as individuals, and more often than not renders meaningful human contact between the races contingent, superficial and fragile.I remember walking around St. Louis and noticing all the well-to-do blocks of houses with security fences, guard posts, 24-hour armed response signs, burglar alarms, one-way street signs and concrete barriers placed at the intersections of their streets with those of the adjacent lower-income (working and poor folks) neighborhoods (oh yeah, the poorer folks were mostly black too) to stop people even driving into their streets from the ""wrong"" side of town. Talk about Fortress America. And these people are free and happy and open-minded? I really don't know.Moore points out that fear (along with the demands of the ""New Economy"" on poor people) is one of the biggest contributors to social problems (including gun violence) in the United States. A lot of people are taking this idea seriously now (it's not just Moore's own personal bandwagon). Maybe you don't feel like you fear others, but how about this: Do you trust them? If you don't, I would argue that some of that is based in fear -of something whether its the power of a boss to fire you or the idea that you might not be able to feed your kids if ""something"" happens to you. I'm not saying that people shouldn't be careful but the difference between caution and suspicion is much subtler than you think.One of the best things in the movie was a comment by a Canadian who said something like, ""When we see Americans locking their doors and putting bars on their windows, we don't see them as protecting themselves, we see them as having imprisoned themselves in their own homes."" Think about it for a second, are you really free?

739236,A5L5ITYHNCJYL,B00008DDVU,"Chris Honaker ""reviewman""","[3, 6]","First of all I would like to correct some of the inaccurate statements some reviewers have made about this movie.  The movie is not about american deaths, what causes the most deaths, which country is the safest to live in, or necessilary pointing blame at certain people or things about gun violence.  The movie focuses on gun access and what areas can our country work on to make sure that gun access and human behavior as it relates to having a gun be better.  The Columbine incident was a sad reminder of how unsafe our country really is when kids can't even go to school without the risk of getting killed.  Moore tries to find out why America is so obsessed with guns, why guns are not that big of a problem in other countries, and are the reasons why people committ such as evil deeds.  One thing I found interesting in this movie is when they discussed a six year old boy shooting a six year girl.  The boy's mother worked two jobs for a total of 80 hours I believe they said and still couldn't pay off her debts.  Moore confronted Dick Clark about it since she worked at his restruant to try and find out why that is.  He didn't put the blame on Mr. Clark, he was just trying to figure out why this woman spent that much time away from her kid and still couldn't make ends meet.  I thought it was strange when Mr. Moore went into a bank to open up a checking account and was given a gun for joining with this bank.  Also, I don't understand why people bash Moore statistics on gun murders in America, b/c think about it, people in this country are getting killed everyday with guns so it's hard to really have the accurate numbers on these types of deaths.  Plus, this movie is 2 years old so of course the numbers will vary.  As much as I dislike Marliyn Mansion, I have to agree with Mr. Moore when he states that you can't blame musicians or video games for human behavior.  People have brains and common sense, but sometimes it is not used.  Anyway, I enjoyed the movie and even though it doesn't really provide an answer for why gun violence is as bad as it is or what can be done to stop it, it does make you think.

739237,A423XLYS1Q1D6,B00008DDVU,"Christian Wheeler ""Husband/Father/Gamer/Proud...","[37, 55]","I refused to subscribe to the hype surrounding this feature until I saw it and analyzed it for myself. (For the record, I'm politically independent). After viewing it, I have to say I am now one of its detractors.What could have been an interesting look at America's gun culture and the sources of the Columbine massacre is instead an overhyped and poorly structured mess. Nearly every argument Moore expounds is flawed by his patronizing and sanctimonious attitude towards the truth. During the course of this documentary he:1) Misquotes stats to fit his agenda. He does this so much that I'm not going to waste time documenting every example. He notes that Canada has double our unemployment rate but many fewer homicides, failing to note that Canada's population is smaller than ours; in other words, he doesn't consider crimes by percentage of population; rather, he just looks at percentages overall. He also states that Canadians have seven million guns in ten million homes, but they have fewer homicides. Well, Canada has much stricter handgun licensing and registration laws than the US; i.e.; they have better gun control; yet Moore undermines his own point by stating that our looser gun control laws aren't the reason for gun violence; it's our culture. So, why try to make a serious, defining point about Canada's rate of gun ownership if you're going to make it irrelevant with your own words? He also ignores the decline in youth violence and school shootings. He holds up two incidents--Columbine, and a shooting in Flint, Michigan--as examples of an ""epidemic.""Moore also claims that overseas military action by the US goverment is part of the reason for our ""culture of violence,"" citing the bombing of Afghanistan as evidence of our aggression. He notes that the United Kingdom has a substantially smaller number of homicides than the US. He fails to acknowledge, however, the UK's role in the bombing of Yugoslavia and its role in the military action in Iraq. If the two are interrelated, then why the discrepancy? He also tries to accuse the US of funding the same Taliban regime responsible for harboring Bin Laden and Al Qaeda when he ominously notes that the US gave $245 million to Afghanistan in 2000 and 2001. Wrong again, Michael. That money was given to the UN and independent organizations for famine relief.2) He alters the notorious 1988 Bush/Quayle ""Willie Horton"" ad by adding some superimposed text: ""Willie Horton released. Then he kills again."" This was NEVER in the original ad (available online, if you want proof) but Moore somehow forgets to note this alteration and just lets his audience assume that it's the truth. (For the record, after being released, Horton did not kill; he committed rape).3) Moore is generally guilty of every sin he accuses the media of committing. He argues time and again that the media is reponsible for America's culture of fear and violence. He implies that they sensationalize violence and portray certain people--namely blacks--in stereotypical ways. That's funny, because Moore spends a fair portion of time both sensationalizing violence and portraying mean-spirited stereotypes--not of blacks, but of average-Joe, working-class gun owners. They come across as ignorant, uneducated rednecks, with Moore pausing occasionally for a bit of juvenile humor at their expense. This is especially egregious, since Moore has long championed himself as an advocate of the working class; yet he spends a great deal of time mocking them.--He also resorts to the worst tactics of tabloid journalism, getting people to cry on camera (while he provides comfort) or attempting to interview people only vaguely attached to the Columbine massacre (such as Dick Clark). He brings two wounded Columbine students to KMart's headquarters, guilting them into dropping their sale of ammunition. (Funny, though; he doesn't speak of going after the companies that made the chemicals in Klebold and Harris' homemade bombs). The nadir, however, is his ambush interview of NRA president Charlton Heston, who seems both confused and outraged. Even if Heston had had all of his faculties, Moore would have made a mess of this interview. His line of questioning was incoherent, unconnected and irrelevant. It is obvious that he only sought to embarrass Heston (Moore's dislike of him is well-known) rather than gain any insight for his viewers. It is an unconfortable and tasteless segment.What a mess. Moore, who showed some talent as a filmmaker with the wry (but statistically flawed) ""Roger and Me,"" has used his abilities to produce a shoddy, irresponsible documentary that is a serious affront to the truth. Moore would have better served us by addressing some of the unanswered questions about Columbine--the possibility of a 3rd gunman, was there advanced warning, etc.--than by wasting our time with this travesty.I am sorry this is so long, but I felt that these were things that needed to be said.",1,An honest review,1067731200,"11 2, 2003",2003,4952,"['refused', 'subscribe', 'hype', 'surrounding',

Before I go on let me briefly sum up the film: MM attempts to discover what is wrong with America- specifically violence in America. The Columbine shootings in spring of 1999 are MM's starting point. MM tries to point out the dubious links posited by the media monster- brilliantly portrayed in a montage of `scares' thrown out by the media- things from Halloween candy to weight loss products. This is an avenue worth pursuing, & the `scaring' of Americans into becoming consumers of anything that will substitute as a nipple is a great point. But it's made by shock rocker Marilyn Manson (a Columbine scapegoat), not MM, & then immediately dropped. MM also is at his best when he details corporate America's need to portray black men as `the problem' despite far more crime being perpetuated by white & white-collared sorts. Instead, we get a whole bunch of amusing, but pointless red herrings- the Michigan Militia, the Nirvana of Canadian existence (aptly showing how good the Canadian health care system is, but woefully neglecting the severe curtailing of Canadian civil liberties- most notably free speech- in pursuit of this goal), workfare programs- which I agree are terrible because they perpetuate an underclass, yet do not let a bad single mother whose 6 year old son killed another 6 year old girl off the hook (as MM tries to imply), a nasty Dick Clark- who employed said bad single mother for slave wages in a mall restaurant, a doddering & senile Charlton Heston- whom MM dishonestly snookered in to an attack interview, & then- in the film's most pompous & sickening moment- left the murdered 6 year old's photo on Heston's property, as if to imply that CH was responsible for her death- not the boy, nor the mother. I admire- & LOVE- how MM uses the media's tools against them in such a screeding fashion. But he has become what he hates with this distortion. Nowhere does MM follow up on the public's & media's appetite for sensationalism- instead he uses 2 dimwitted boys who survived being shot at Columbine to shame K-Mart in to removing bullets from their store's inventory. 1 can argue the rightness or wrongness of this act- I think they were within their rights to demand such, but it's ultimately a futile act. BUT the point is this was not done for any other reason than to bring MM's film to a climax. Instead of showing a problem, discussing its causes, & effects, & then proposing a solution- which a true documentary does, MM's film simply drops the ball at the end, settling for its own 2 hours of sensationalized splendor in MM's sun. The film is much more about Michael Moore's need to preen & pat himself on the back, than in provoking any real debate. Behind us, at the theater, was a typical professorial type who Pavlovianly jeered at the right wingers, tsk-tsked at the appropriate moments of their stupidity, all the while, under his breath, mm-mming at the enlightened left wingers who, truthfully, to an objective viewer, came off being just as stupid as the Michigan Militia men- in their own predictably obtuse ways. Think long of Pogo's injunction about enemies while viewing this film.Still, the film would make Leni Riefenstahl proud. & it would make `true' Liberals proud, as well, were the film not so laced with  truths & such. MM has stated that he thinks only 10-20% of people who see his work will get it right away- therefore he has to distort with humor.

As such, people watching the film are likely to make immediate assumptions about the quality and veracity of the film based on their position on the political spectrum.  This is too bad because the film is probably more balanced than most would expect.  In fact, the most interesting aspect of ""Bowling for Columbine"" is Moore's own journey through the material.  His initial, left-wing tendency is to blame the amount of violence (specifically gun violence) in the United States on (1) the number of guns and the ease of acquiring them, and (2) the poverty-racism combo.  In the end, he has dismissed these reasons and others to settle on a more insidious and difficult-to-fix observation: that the U.S. (as a nation, as a people) are overly and inappropriately afraid, and that fear leads them to self-protection in the form of preemptive violence (as a nation attacking other nations and as citizens attacking each other).That this is a documentary to advance a particular point-of-view is obvious.  However, Moore is generally (and wisely) a non-judgemental interviewer on screen.  Of course, he doesn't need to supply commentary over Charlton Heston's self-righteous indignation that he has every right to hold a pro-gun rally in the same city as the Columbine massacre, a mere 2 weeks later.  Perhaps in the light of fair play, he includes interviews with a number of Michigan militia members who are very forthright and even convincing in their defense of the 2nd ammendment.It turns out, in the final analysis, that much-maligned shock-rocker Marilyn Manson supplies the kernal of the film, with the most concise and compelling summary of Moore's thesis: that U.S. culture is one of ""fear and consumption - as long as you're afraid, you'll buy stuff.""  In fact, fear is used to sell goods: ""Cut to commercial... buy Colgate or no one will talk to you because your breath smells bad... If you have pimples the girls won't want to f*** you...""  If fear is used effectively to sell toothpaste, it's an indication of how the undercurrent of fear runs through country.  Likewise, as one member of the Michigan militia puts it, ""When someone attacks you, you need to be able to defend yourself in the best manner possible.""  Note that she uses the word ""when"", not ""if"" - for these people it's a foregone conclusion that violence will happen, it's just a matter of time.However, if Michael Moore is convinced that guns are not the problem, he has not convinced me.  When comparing gun-murder statistics between Canada and the U.S., for example, he points out that per capita, Canadians have as many guns, but the gun murder rate is 1/10.  However, he neglects to point out that guns are used in fewer crimes, for example, because it's hard to sneak into a store or bank concealing the kinds of guns (long-barrel shotguns and rifles) that are common in Canada.  Assault guns and other semi-automatic weapons are outright illegal, and handguns are severely restricted (in some provinces, it's illegal to have them in the home, they must be stored at the gun club).  If you only look at guns that are specifically designed to kill people (as opposed to animals), per capita ownership in the U.S. is much higher than in other Western countries.There are other sleights-of-hand that Moore uses that harm his thesis by lowering credibility.  For example, he rightfully compares the state-sanctioned destruction of American indiginous peoples with the state-sanctioned destruction of Jews in the Third Reich, but then goes on to imply that NATO's campaign in Kosovo was somehow equivalent (in spirit if not in scale).  He then goes further by speculating that the military violence performed by an army ordered by a commander-in-chief (Clinton, the Bushes) is somehow equivalent to school-age kids murdering classmates.  There is a very distinct difference between military killing and civic killing, which is enshrined in U.S. and international law, not to mention in most of the major religions.Notwithstanding these objections, Moore is still convincing - it is fear that drives people to barricade themselves into gated communities, join militias, and keep loaded .45 Magnums under their pillows at night.  He is also convincing that the fear is generally unfounded - violent crime in the U.S. is decreasing while reporting of it is way up.  Most importantly, because this is a popular film, the arguments are presented in an entertaining and thought-provoking way, so this film is recommended.The 2-disc DVD edition contains some interesting extras, but they are mostly more philosophising and political commentary from Moore.  It's a bit self-aggrandising because, ss he himself points out in the introduction to the audio commentary, everything he has to say is in the film and needs no more explanation (he then turns the commentary over to his interns, secretaries, etc. in a wonderfully socialistic gesture).",4,Guns don't kill people -

739243,A1YIYS3J7EQ3F8,B00008DDVU,"C. Santas ""Constantine/film buff""","[2, 5]","Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine is a fine documentary, as far as the art of the documentary is concerned--good camera work, juxtapositions by montages, scene building, and even some traces of a plot--but its point of view is slanted to the point that the film loses, consciously one must admit, all sense of objectivity. Rather, the object seems to place practically all guilt for the shootings on gun ownership and the NRA. It is also determined to debunk Charlton Heston, laying on him the onus of insensitivity, and even stupidity. Moore, doubtless, is presenting his film as an indictment of the the far right and its obsession with guns, and he is honestly concerned about the violence and the carnage in this country, blaming it all not just on the mentality of some people and groups of people but on the right to own guns. It is not people but guns that kill people. While all this is abundantly documented (without actually violent scens one might expect), the film only gives superficial explanations as to the causes that produced the killings. The comparisons are given between countries with extremely low crime rates (Australia, Germany, Japan, and others) and America--comparisions overwhelmingly depressing if you are American--do little to offer insights into this horrendous gap. A documentary has to have a point of view,and this one does: I am against guns, and the NRA is the major culprit, Moore says. Yet, the documentary, meritorious as it is on a certain level, fails to offer a truly insightful and convincing reason why ""we"" are what we are; to say that the NRA (and Heston) share the blame for the carnage is one thing; to fully explain where the desire for gun ownership comes from is another.",4,"Fine, but lacking depth",1062547200,"09 3, 2003",2003,1728,"['Michael', 'Moore', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'fine', 'documentary', 'as', 'far', 'art', 'documentary', 'concerned', 'good', 'camera', 'work', 'juxtapositions', 'montages', 'scene', 'building', 'even', 'traces', 'plot', 'point', 'view', 'slanted', 'point', 'film', 'consciously', 'one', 'must', 'admit', 'sense', 'objectivity', 'object', 'place', 'practically', 'guilt', 'shootings', 'gun', 'ownership', 'NRA', 'also', 'determined', 'debunk', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'laying', 'onus', 'insensitivity', 'even', 'stupidity', 'Moore', 'doubtless', 'presenting', 'film', 'indictment', 'far', 'right', 'obsession', 'guns', 'honestly', 'concerned', 'violence', 'carnage', 'country', 'blaming', 'not', 'just', 'mentality', 'people', 'groups', 'people', 'right', 'own', 'guns', 'not', 'people', 'guns', 'kill', 'people', 'abundantly', 'documented', 'actually', 'violent', 'scens', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'film', 'only', 'superficial', 'explanations', 'causes', 'produced', 'killings', 'comparisons', 'are', 'given', 'countries', 'extremely', 'low', 'crime', 'rates', 'Australia', 'Germany', 'Japan', 'others', 'America', 'comparisions', 'overwhelmingly', 'depressing', 'are', 'American', 'do', 'little', 'offer', 'insights', 'horrendous', 'gap', 'documentary', 'have', 'point', 'view', 'one', 'am', 'guns', 'NRA', 'major', 'culprit', 'Moore', 'documentary', 'meritorious', 'certain', 'level', 'offer', 'truly', 'insightful', 'convincing', 'reason', 'why', 'are', 'what', 'are', 'say', 'NRA', 'Heston', 'share', 'blame', 'carnage', 'one', 'thing', 'fully', 'explain', 'where', 'desire', 'gun', 'ownership']",Bowling For Columbine VHS
739244,AZYJ9TS07B02W,B00008DDVU,Czinczar,"[5, 11]","In the tradition of ""Roger & Me"" and his two TV series, Michael Moore uses his amazing editing skills to produce a polemical film filled with an astounding amount of irony. I am in awe of his virtuosic editing. The sheer emotional impact of his editing can't be denied. But decision making should be based on more than just emotions. No one can mistake this for an even handed, objective documentary. This is clearly propaganda. To achieve its goal, propaganda doesn't care about facts. It cares about emotions. To sway our emotions, Moore once again relies on his old technique of twisting the truth. Ignored facts, facts out of order, and sometimes outright lies. Many important facts from the pro-gun side are left out: the Founding Fathers' writings, the huge number of people who have defended themselves using guns, and the huge rise in crime rates in countries that have disarmed their citizens. Moore ponders the reason for the high murder rate in the U. S., but never really finds the answer. The best he can offer is a cynically amusing cartoon. As a flaming liberal who is also very pro-gun, I can recommend every Moore production except this one (and ""Canadian Bacon,"" which was just plain lousy). But from a purely cinematic viewpiont, I can't recommend this highly enough. Yes, I'm torn. I certainly hope people will base their final decision on the gun issue on more than this biased, emotional movie. I hope they'll be more dispassionate and get all the facts on both sides. Moore spins an emotionally compelling story, but not the full story. As a Michigan Militia member in the movie asked, ""Who's going to protect you? The cops? the government?"" To his discredit, Moore never deals with the fact that the obvious answer to that question is ""Neither.""",4,Still the master of irony,1048896000,"03 29, 2003",2003,1769,"['tradition', 'Roger', 'Me', 'two', 'TV', 'series', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'amazing', 'editing', 'skills', 'produce', 'polemical', 'film', 'filled', 'astounding', 'amount', 'irony', 'am', 'awe', 'virtuosic', 'editing', 'sheer', 'emotional', 'impact', 'editing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'denied', 'decision', 'making', 'should', 'be', 'based', 'more', 'just', 'emotions', 'one', 'can', 'mistake', 'even', 'handed', 'objective', 'documentary', 'clearly', 'propaganda', 'achieve', 'goal', 'propaganda', ""n't"", 'care', 'facts', 'emotions', 'sway', 'emotions', 'Moore', 'once', 'again', 'relies', 'old', 'technique', 'twisting', 'truth', 'Ignored', 'facts', 'order', 'sometimes', 'outright', 'lies', 'Many', 'important', 'facts', 'pro-gun', 'side', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'writings', 'huge', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'defended', 'using', 'guns', 'huge', 'rise', 'crime', 'rates', 'countries', 'have', 'disarmed', 'citizens', 'Moore', 'ponders', 'reason', 'high', 'murder', 'rate', 'U.', 'S.', 'never', 'really', 'answer', 'best', 'can', 'offer', 'cynically', 'amusing', 'cartoon', 'flaming', 'liberal', 'who', 'also', 'very', 'pro-gun', 'can', 'recommend', 'Moore', 'production', 'one', 'Canadian', 'Bacon', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'lousy', 'purely', 'cinematic', 'viewpiont', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'highly', 'enough', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'torn', 'certainly', 'hope', 'people', 'will', 'base', 'final', 'decision', 'gun', 'issue', 'more', 'biased', 'emotional', 'movie', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'be', 'more', 'dispassionate', 'get', 'facts', 'sides', 'Moore', 'emotionally', 'compelling', 'story', 'not', 'full', 'story', 'Michigan', 'Militia', 'member', 'movie', 'asked', 'Who', 'going', 'protect', 'cops', 'government', 'discredit', 'Moore', 'never', 'fact', 'obvious', 'answer', 'question', 'Neither']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

That's not necessarily a bad thing, though: ""Bowling"" is both more ambitious and ultimately more entertaining that ""Roger and Me.""Let's get the basics out of the way: ""Bowling for Columbine"" is ostensibly Moore's quest to find out what motivated Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the self-described 'Trenchcoat Mafia' who murdered 13 of their fellow classmates (and a teacher) in Littleton, Colorado in April 1999. The title of the film refers to the pair's unusual pre-massacre activity: they went bowling.I say ""Bowling"" is 'ostensibly' about the Columbine massacre because the film is only obliquely, and shallowly, concerned with the horrific events in Littleton.  The facts of the killing are dealt with briefly, and we never see pictures of Harris or Klebold; indeed, the security camera film that captured the massacre in the library (grainy, ominous, and horrible, with an instrumental version of Marilyn Manson's ""Nobodies"" in the background) is frustrating in that it is impossible to see either of the killers.  Of course, Moore is making a larger point in ""Bowling"": that the Columbine massacre was not simply a unique incident, but symptomatic of some underlying American disease. ""Bowling"", then, is Moore's attempt to address and discover the disease itself. Unfortunately, along the way, Moore's diagnosis is hijacked by two of the filmmaker's favorite bugaboos: gun control and the National Rifle Association (NRA).Michael Moore is himself a strange and highly filmable character, a huge, rangy, lumbering man whose physical presence, particularly when paired with cowering corporate drones frantically parsing their comments, is screechingly funny. Moore has the true documentarian's gift for capturing the absurd on film, and his timing, for the most part, is impeccable. Indeed, when Moore is not preaching and simply lets the camera roll, the film is at its most hysterical. The encounter with the K-Mart PR flak is wonderful; so too is the interview with a Michigan state trooper, who waxes on a bit too much concerning an accident where a hunter is shot by the rifle he draped around his dog's neck---all to get a ""cute"" picture. A snippet of dialogue will suffice:TROOPER: ""The picture would have been really cute.""MOORE: ""But do you think the dog might have done it intentionally, had an idea of what it was doing?""TROOPER: ""Oh, I can't say, sir. I don't know.""Dialogue like this is in abundant supply, and how can you hate a man who badgers Dick Clarke (who escapes in a minivan)? Even better is Moore's interview with members of the Michigan militia: again, the brilliance in this sequence is that Moore's camera (and the idiotic comments made by the militia members) tells the story, without Moore having to say a thing. Slightly more uncomfortable is Moore's interview with James Nichols, who was indicted in the Oklahoma City Federal Building bombing along with his more infamous brother and Tim McVeigh. To me, this was one of the most disturbing parts of the movie; Nichols is so manic that I actually felt concerned for Moore's safety. This sequence is actually quite compelling, leading me to conclude that perhaps with certain folks (Nichols, for instance), a little gun control might not be a bad thing.""Bowling"" is not a bad film, but it is a muddled film. Moore wants desperately to bash the NRA, but by his own admission American gun ownership is not really the culprit behind the violence of American society. There are some issues where Moore's taste is questionable, of course: the heavily edited interview with Charleton Heston comes across as oafish, and the animated ""Brief History of the United States"" is deplorably racist.But if anything, Moore hobbles his own movie by not addressing his own thesis: if gun ownership isn't the issue, then what is? What follows is Moore jumping from one causal link to another: violent video games, shock rock, Goth culture, drugs, sex, rock n' roll, and the focus-deprived American media, all linked by sequences where Moore bashes the NRA.This is where the movie is most frustrating: Moore comes close, very close, to understanding Columbine, with two very keen interviews---and nonetheless misses the larger point. South Park producer/director/creator Matt Stone makes some very precise points about the nature of American high school culture, a time in wihch evolution seems in reverse, when those least fit to succeed in the larger culture terrorize those who are brightest, most ambitious, and most different.By far the best interview in the piece is with Marilyn Manson, who suggests the best way of dealing with bullying and harrassment in high school is to grow up, to get through it, and to discover that life is dramatically different (and far more rewarding) after graduation. Matt Stone, Marilyn Manson, and Bill Gates, and even Michael Moore prove it: the geeks shall inherit the Earth.Asked by Moore what he would tell Harris and Klebold if he could, Manson provides the film's best nuggest of wisdom: ""I would say nothing at all; I would listen. And that was exactly what wasn't done.""A pity that Mr. Moore, for all his cinematic talents, didn't heed that advice. That said, ""Bowling for Columbine"" is well done, informative, provocative, and entertaining. And by the way, is it really that easy to get an interview with Heston?",4,"Witty, funny, horrifying, exasperating---and nearly right.",1051228800,"04 25, 2003",2003,5743,"['Full', 'disclosure', 'ca',

I loved his latest book, ""Stupid White Men"" and his series, ""The Awful Truth"", was a riot.  This documentary tackles the serious issue of gun control.  While there are very somber moments throughout the film due to the subject matter, Moore also uses humor to get his point across.  And there are scenes in the documentary that are worth the price of admission alone.  When he visits Charleton Heston, for example, it is pure pleasure to see Heston squirming in his seat by the end of the interview when Moore starts asking him questions that he can't answer.  Another interesting interview is with Terry Nichols, one of the men charged in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building.  I won't go into details about it but its funny as well.  He gives lots of information about death by guns---the U. S. has an astronomically high rate of around 11,000 a year as compared to, for example, Japan which has 39 deaths.  While there is no easy answer to this huge problem, at least this documentary addresses the issue and gets people to talking about it.  Upon leaving the cinema I heard several groups of people discussing their views on the film and it's subject matter and that is what a director wants to achieve out of his/her film.

739250,A2NH6XSE79X3VY,B00008DDVU,Dave,"[0, 3]","I expected a little more from this movie after watching Farenheit 911, perhaps Moore has gotten better with time.  It's difficult to grasp what point he's trying to make in this film.  In one breath Moore says that Americans are afraid of one another and lock their doors every night and behave irrationally, yet in the next he lists crime statistics as being multiple times higher than other countries.  So what is the point?  Americans lock their door because the crime rate is high, it seems like we're actually being intelligent rather than irrational.  The cartoon with the Pilgrams and early America is hilarious and worth the price of admission, but even that winds up being very skewed at the end.  I wish Moore would have tackled the problem of inner cities and the rampant gun problem rather than attack the ""whites"" throughout the entire film.I am certainly in favor of far stricter regulations and laws regarding gun use, but Moore just seems to touch on way too many points that are disjointed.  At one point he attacks the media for scaring us, yet he is a very member of this media and is basically just a reporter himself.  There are some very humorous parts and some very intelligent insights, but Moore was definitely more polished by the time he produced Farenheit.

739251,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,B00008DDVU,David Anderson,"[1, 5]","""Bowling For Columbine"" wonderfully explores the reality of the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms.  Michael Moore asks, ""what causes violence if it's not the guns?""  He proves that there is no certain answer.  His outspokenness and his deep information deserves the honor as the highest grossing documentary in movie history and the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature.Three celebrities: Charlton Heston, Dick Clark, and Marilyn Manson are featured.  Charlton Heston is the president of NRL (National Rifle Association).  Moore argues the appropriateness of Heston speaking in a pro-gun rally ten days after the Columbine school shooting and again ten days after a six-year old girl was shoot in a Michigan school by a peer classmate.  Dick Clark's short scene in the documentary expressed his inconsideration toward the slain girl.  Moore approaches his van asking for an interview.  Moore revealed that her mom is forced to work 70 hours per week in a welfare job sponsered by Clark.  Clark's reaction is shocking!  Marilyn Manson is the only featured celebrity who speaks brilliantly.  Manson reveals his reaction toward being blamed for inspiring Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold to shoot 12 students and a teacher in their school.  He shares what actions he's take if he could meet the two troubled kids.Moore asks ""are we safe in our houses?""  He travels to Canada and parts of the US interviewing random citizens about their beliefs.  They answer what often happens to those who don't lock their doors.  However, the opposite is expressed while he asks, ""why are we always scared?""  An LAPD shockingly reveals why no one is arrested for creating pollution, which is more dangerous than guns.  An illustrated scene gives an informative brief history of American fear.""Bowling For Columbine"" is an eye opening experience.  It's recommended that everybody watches this at least twice.  It will inspire Americans to act upon their beliefs as did Michael Moore.  One never knows their capabities until they work.

When he throws his stats around, he mixes apples and oranges. He doesn't give respect to the populations of the counties in question, he counts `gun deaths' differently from case to case and he lies about the chronology of numerous events. Moore simply patched together a series of dubious stats and out of context file footage. His goal was to frustrate the political right with lies and to fuel the fire of ignorance on the political left. He succeeded.And when his integrity is questioned, Moore immediately counters with a flagrant ad hominem attack. He says that everyone who discredits his movie is a `right wing zealot' with malicious motivations. He will not even entertain questions about the truthfulness of his so called documentary. His only defense is the fallacious statement, 'All of the facts in my film are true.' No crap! How stupid does he think we are? Saying, `All of the facts in my film are true' is like saying, `All of the [true statements] in my film are true.' What arrogance.Don't give Moore any pleasure by buying this piece of garbage.

739257,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00008DDVU,Dennis Littrell,"[2, 3]","Did Charlton Heston get blind-sided by Michael Moore?  Yes, but he's definitely old enough and savvy enough to know better.  Did Moore gain entry to the Heston Hollywood mansion using false pretenses?  No, he told the one-time celluloid god of the waters that he was a lifetime, paid-up member of the National Rifle Association, and once inside even showed his membership card.  And, although the average guy in the street might be disarmed by Moore's folksy style and declasse dress code, Heston knew that Moore was a big time media guy (previous film: Roger and Me; book: Stupid White Men).But Heston never misses a chance to spread the Second Amendment gospel.  He just thought he could handle the situation.  There's no fool like an old fool, they say.  To his credit, when he realized that he had fallen into a trap, he moseyed off, putting one gimpy leg carefully in front of the other as he carried a bent back and a 79-year-old frame off camera.Well, was this fair?  Indeed, was the entire film fair?  No, of course not.  This is Michael Moore simultaneously making a buck, building a rep, and working a cause.  The cause is something like 11,000 dead-by-gunshot Americans every year (a pretty good cause), and the target is indeed Charlton Heston, long-time spokesman not only for God, but more significantly, the NRA, and of course gun and ammo manufacturers and sellers.  So at least we can say that Michael Moore was after big game.He mostly bagged them too (and made Dick Clark look heartless), but somehow I didn't gain much satisfaction.  I don't care much for Charlton Heston, either as an actor or a proselytizer, but I am finding, after watching this and Fahrenheit 9/11, that I don't care much for Michael Moore either.  I think all good, right-thinking liberals should continue to play fair even though the opposition might not.  This film preached to the choir and a good time was had by all who agree with Moore's point of view.  The cover on this DVD even quotes Time Magazine as saying the film is ""hilarious.""Somehow though I don't think those on the right thought it was all that funny.  And I wonder if those in the middle were swayed one way or the other.  It is indeed heartbreaking that kids in this country pick up guns and shoot each other, and the fact that they do it much more often per capita than any other country in the First World does indeed call for an explanation.  Ironically, I think Heston actually had the answer.  This is a violent country with a violent history relative to other industrial nations.  Moore and Heston agreed that our history isn't more violent than, say, Germany's, but they got their ideas confused.  In Germany the violence was by the state and its armies and its police.  We have plenty of that as well of course, but in the US we also have a tradition of the handy six-shooter in the holster for a quick draw and a further tradition of celebrating the rugged individual who stands up against the state and anyone wanting to take his arms away.Personally I think there's a lot to be said and not said for both sides in this all too American debate.  The Freudian implication that would-be macho guys need guns symbolically to feel like men is very real.  It was no accident that Heston let slip the ""multi-ethnic"" rationale for explaining all those dead by firearms in the USA, a rationale that is usually interpreted to mean fear of a big black dude breaking into one's home.  Or actually that is often a sort of ""make my day"" fantasy indulged in by some randy militia types as they sip a little Jack Daniels on the front porch swing as they fondle their weapon.Well, what's the answer?  There is no answer.  It is a gradual process from the jungle to civilization, and the US, in this gun-toting regard, is just a little behind the rest of the West.  If Michael Moore wants to focus on some people who really adore their weapons, he should take a trip to Iraq or Afghanistan, or just watch the nightly news.Still this is worth seeing as a kind of Americana snapshot portfolio.  Marilyn Manson proves a fine foil for Charlton Heston, and the Afro-American elementary school principal can be balanced against the poor little black kid who shot the little white girl, who can be contrasted with the members of the NRA who think the black kid should be tried as an adult, who can be contrasted with the kids at Columbine who were just there when it happened.  And the mentality of Moore and his crew in imagining that they won a ""victory"" against K-Mart when it agreed to take the ammo off it shelves can be contrasted with the young dude who was disappointed that he wasn't named a number one collaborating suspect.  (Actually the ammo sales are small potatoes to K-Mart which has big management and bottom-line problems.)But see this to study the techniques used by Moore.

Nevertheless, it is interesting to notice how blame is shifted from hand to hand, pointing fingers at ""mixed ethnicity"" and Marilyn Manson, and not seeing anyone showing up and doing something about gun control.An especially heartbreaking (or, at least, thought provoking and emotion stirring) ocasion is the story of the 6 year old girl that gets shot by a classmate and, when brought up to conversation with Mr. Heston, is dismissed as being at all an important event that should drive a more tight control of gun possession.And pay attention to the clear mind and interesting points made by musician Marilyn Manson, accused of being one of the reasons that led two kids in Colorado to go off in a murderous rampage. Not being a fan of his music I admired what he had to say and how he answered Mr. Moore's questions in a very objective and insightful manner. 5 stars for that.All in all, Michael Moore addresses the issue of gun control in a thought provoking film that should be seen and analyzed before judging someone for being against or in favour of gun control.",5,Mo(o)re gun control,1128038400,"09 30, 2005",2005,1358,"['anything', 'should', 'watch', 'listen', 'think', 'only', 'then', 'express', 'opinion', 'responsible', 'manner', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'gun', 'control', 'though', 'should', 'hit', 'home', 'fairly', 'clearly', 'even', 'sometimes', 'can', 'be', 'somewhat', 'biased', 'message', 'get', 'Nevertheless', 'interesting', 'notice', 'how', 'blame', 'shifted', 'hand', 'hand', 'pointing', 'fingers', 'mixed', 'ethnicity', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'not', 'seeing', 'anyone', 'showing', 'up', 'doing', 'something', 'gun', 'control.An', 'especially', 'heartbreaking', 'least', 'thought', 'provoking', 'emotion', 'stirring', 'ocasion', 'story', '6', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'shot', 'classmate', 'when', 'brought', 'up', 'conversation', 'Mr.', 'Heston', 'dismissed', 'being', 'important', 'event', 'should', 'drive', 'more', 'tight', 'control', 'gun', 'possession.And', 'pay', 'attention', 'clear', 'mind', 'interesting', 'points', 'made', 'musician', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'accused', 'being', 'one', 'reasons', 'led', 'two', 'kids', 'Colorado', 'go', 'off', 'murderous', 'rampage', 'Not', 'being', 'fan', 'music', 'admired', 'what', 'had', 'say', 'how', 'answered', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'questions', 'very', 'objective', 'insightful', 'manner', '5', 'stars', 'that.All', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'issue', 'gun', 'control', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'analyzed', 'judging', 'someone', 'being', 'favour', 'gun', 'control']",Bowling For Columbine VHS
739261,A3EJYJC25OJVKK,B00008DDVU,"Distant Voyageur ""Nicholas Computer""","[13, 23]","I have to say that this documentary that I saw just last week ""Bowling For Columbine"" was a very big eye opener for me. In a lot of ways, I was already aware of the fact that guns in America are very prevalent in our society and culture but you won't believe how easy it was to actually buy the ammo for these things. Just watch the documentary and see for yourself at what I'm saying here.Another thing to look at is the dire gap between the rich and the poor, even between the upper and lower class workers in the same building. You got the story of an impoverished mother who worked two jobs just to make ends meet and even then she was in danger of losing her home because she could no longer afford it and would go for an 80 mile bus trip every day to work at a fancy Dick Clark restaurant and her son got a hold of the gun that was used in the shooting in Flint, Michigan a few years ago. I was absolutely heartbroken by the news of that. When I watched this, I lost all my respect for Dick Clark when seeing htis and it's absolutely a shame how so many rich guys just contribute almost nothing to less fortunate sectors of society although there are some exceptions.Michael Moore to me is a true hero in our society. He aims to expose the truth and go deep into the roots of such problems like our dangerous obsession with guns. Included in this documentary are footage of Moore with two COlumbine survivors one of whom lost the use of his legs and the other still has some bullets embedded within his body. It's really heartbreaking but it's true. I lost all my respect for Charlton Heston when seeing this too.I'm not saying that I support the idea that they should get all guns away from citizens because I believe that we all have the right to bear arms but a part of me thinks that we have become a really violent society that is obsessed with guns and shoot-em-up games and gore.Go and see this documentary. It will piss you off, it will make you think hard but it will ultimately be a very rewarding watch as it delves deep beyond what news channels funnel into our minds.Michael Moore, you are great!",5,This is a really excellent insight into our love 4 guns,1078012800,"02 29, 2004",2004,2115,"['have', 'say', 'documentary', 'saw', 'just', 'last', 'week', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'was', 'very', 'big', 'eye', 'opener', 'lot', 'ways', 'was', 'already', 'aware', 'fact', 'America', 'are', 'very', 'prevalent', 'society', 'culture', 'wo', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'easy', 'was', 'actually', 'buy', 'ammo', 'things', 'Just', 'watch', 'documentary', 'see', 'what', ""'m"", 'saying', 'thing', 'look', 'dire', 'gap', 'rich', 'poor', 'even', 'upper', 'lower', 'class', 'workers', 'same', 'building', 'got', 'story', 'impoverished', 'mother', 'who', 'worked', 'two', 'jobs', 'just', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'even', 'then', 'was', 'danger', 'losing', 'home', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'afford', 'would', 'go', '80', 'mile', 'bus', 'trip', 'day', 'work', 'fancy', 'Dick', 'Clark', 'restaurant', 'son', 'got', 'hold', 'gun', 'was', 'used', 'shooting', 'Flint', 'Michigan', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'absolutely', 'heartbroken', 'news', 'When', 'watched', 'lost', 'respect', 'Dick', 'Clark', 'when', 'seeing', 'htis', 'absolutely', 'shame', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'rich', 'guys', 'just', 'contribute', 'almost', 'nothing', 'less', 'fortunate', 'sectors', 'society', 'are', 'exceptions.Michael', 'Moore', 'true', 'hero', 'society', 'expose', 'truth', 'go', 'deep', 'roots', 'such', 'problems', 'dangerous', 'obsession', 'guns', 'Included', 'documentary', 'are', 'footage', 'Moore', 'two', 'COlumbine', 'survivors', 'one', 'whom', 'lost', 'use', 'legs', 'other', 'still', 'bullets', 'embedded', 'body', 'really', 'heartbreaking', 'true', 'lost', 'respect', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'when', 'seeing', 'too.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'support', 'idea', 'should', 'get', 'guns', 'away', 'citizens', 'believe', 'have', 'right', 'bear', 'arms', 'part', 'have', 'become', 'really', 'violent', 'society', 'obsessed', 'guns', 'shoot-em-up', 'games', 'gore.Go', 'see', 'documentary', 'will', 'piss', 'off', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'hard', 'will', 'ultimately', 'be', 'very', 'rewarding', 'watch', 'deep', 'what', 'news', 'channels', 'funnel', 'minds.Michael', 'Moore', 'are', 'great']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

I believe that it has value, even if, as its detractors claim (and apparently with some justification), it isn't always scrupulously honest in its presentation of the facts.Michael Moore may feel that he is serving some higher purpose which justifies a certain amount of misrepresentation. Maybe he believes that his *message* is true, which allows for some shading on the particulars. I don't agree with that point of view, and I don't respect any intentional deception on Moore's part, but I think that this doesn't devalue Moore's work altogether, so long as the viewer is discriminating and willing to ask questions. After all, there is propaganda on both sides of every issue, so it isn't as though Moore's films require some special skill unique unto them. No, Moore's films just require that we be critical thinkers, which hopefully we are in the first place.In Bowling for Columbine, I was fully willing to be lead down whatever path Moore chose. I expected the man to drive some solid point home, notwithstanding arguments to the contrary or further investigation. What I found, however, was that Moore was slightly unclear in his expose on the nature of gun violence in the US. ""Slightly unclear"" is weak; actually, he's pretty muddled.Moore doesn't want to blame cinema, video games, etc. (and allows no forum for those who would blame them), but seems willing to blame the violence in the news, and American engagements overseas... Do we really think that children are more inspired to violence by, say, reports from Afghanistan, than they are by the Matrix? How many kids regularly even watch the 6 o'clock news? I've heard stories of children doing violent things based off of what they've seen in professional wrestling, or Beavis & Butthead, or Grand Theft Auto, but I've never heard of any instance where a kid said he was inspired by the bombings in Kosovo.Now... I, myself, don't blame movies or video games either, but that's not my point. My point is that Moore wants to uphold these ideas of ""influence"" when convenient to him, and drop them when not. Later, he debunks the idea that a country's history has direct ties to its gun violence (i.e. all of the blood that Germany has on ""its hands,"" yet its people are peaceful)... but offers up missile construction in Littleton as suggestive evidence of what might have caused the Columbine massacre.Moore thinks that the problem is the easy availability of guns and ammunition (K-Mart), but notes that this isn't really true in Canada (where they find similar product in a Wal-Mart). So... if Canada can have a lot of guns & ammo, but not the same rates of violence... then... why blame the problem on such availability in the US?It would be one thing if Moore finally tossed up his hands and said -- ""Well, gosh, I just don't know what the root of the violence is!"" but that's not what he does. He feels free to blame the availability of guns when he wants to strike against K-Mart, and to debunk the guns argument when praising Canada; he is equally as convinced of either side of the argument, depending on which segment you're watching.Moore, at times, feels that ""fear,"" foisted on the American public by our ratings-hungry media, is the root of our violence, and seems to suggest that there's nothing really to be afraid of (hell -- we should be like Canada, and leave our doors unlocked at night)... but then presents statistics that seem to infer that America *really is* more violent (and an epidemic of school shootings, right?)... so which is it? Is there really nothing to be afraid of but fear itself? Or do we have a violence crisis, and are justified in locking up at night? Both. Neither. Again, it depends on the segment because Moore has no cohesive, consistent point of view in this film.Moore shows off his ""life-long"" NRA membership, but never troubles us with an explanation as to what could prompt such a thing. He (seemingly) agrees with Charlton Heston that the right to keep and bear arms is a good thing, but lampoons the 2nd Amendment as a hick defense against people of color in his cartoon history of the United States.In short, this film never aspires to the heights of propaganda because the best propaganda has a clear message. Moore is always clear, but pulls in different directions at different times in his movie, depending on what best serves his immediate purpose. If a person keeps it *all* in mind, from beginning to end, they realize that Moore ultimately doesn't know what the cause of American youth violence is.And... that's fine. Neither do I. And I would respect this film more if Moore were more upfront about it. Instead, he strongly blames the NRA, and overseas military engagements, and the media, and gun availability, and exhonorates all of the same, in turn, when it suits him.Still and all, fun to watch.

We can focus our attention on safety or prolonging life by whatever means but NOTHING...absolutely NOTHING is gonna save ANYONE from the death that is coming so quickly upon them.  I'm sorry but worrying about anything else than the WHY? concerning this fact just totally eclipses all these other issues!

I can already hear laughter and ridicule in response to that statement but those that will are still totally stuck with the fact that they are doomed so far living in this world!  One can join whatever political lobby and become as intellectually aware as they can,  they can have bug fun ridiculing whoever they see as being foolish and ignorant if that makes one feel better ...but it won't help ANYTHING except to have a little fun in the tiny short time they have on this planet.

For there is a promise that if anyone CAN do that (seek Him with all their heart and soul) they will SURELY find Him!  Him that is that is the Great I AM Creator of EVERYTHING and EVERYONE and who loves mercy but hates the lies!  To find HIM unto mercy belongs....THAT ought to be our overwhelming goal!  Seek Mercy!

739267,ADAWLUDA0IZHI,B00008DDVU,"Douglas Ratcliff ""The face that looks out at ...","[18, 30]","Other then a headache and a mild sense of bewilderment, the only thing I got from Bowling for Columbine is a sense that Michael Moore is a huckster and a shameless self-promoter.While trying to verify some of Moore's facts, I became confused as to whether Bowling is supposed to be taken as a serious documentary or a psuedo-docu-comedy (PDC).  And, having seen both documentaries and PDC's I'm not even sure Bowling is either one of those.  I'm not even sure it can be called a film, unless you go with the  ""to become coated or obscured"" definition.Bowling's greatest weakness is a lack of focus.  In both documentaries and PDC's, there is generally one subject or a group of subjects connected by a common event/experience/belief.  If Bowling has a subject, I would guess it has to be Moore.  Unfortunately, Michael Moore is not a very interesting subject and nowhere near as witty as he must think he is.Moore spends the running time aimlessly wandering between Flint MI, Columbine CO, and L.A. CA.  He seems to focus on gun violence and the question of why so many American's kill other Americans (presumably with guns, but it never clearly established if Moore is talking about murder in general or murders involving guns).Random facts are thrown at the viewer presumably in support of whatever Moore's argument is. Or maybe its just to throw random facts and the audience.It could just all be the white man's fault.  In fact, a short cartoon blaming white male Puritans for slavery, the KKK, the NRA, and the current murder rate in the U.S. (once again, presumably gun related murders) is about the only coherent part of this mess.  In fact, I think this cartoon short is the only thing that qualifies as a film in the ""movie"" sense of the word.  Anyway, white men are blamed for slavery, U.S. white men in particular, and no mention of any other country's involvement in the slave trade is made.  It is not even mentioned that slavery is still going on today.  Black on black slavery in Sudan and all kinds of sex slavery all over Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.Moore does have a point on how the U.S. news media and politicians scare the American public into a state of learned helplessness, and he claims the same is not true in Canada or Europe, but he never goes anywhere with this point.  Maybe a simple comparison of the U.S. and Canadian constitutions and the role the press is given by each might have been instructive, but Moore, in his eagerness to blame America first, never takes the opportunity.The movie is called Bowling for Columbine but the only thing documented is Moore's, and by extension, the U.S. left's descent into bitterness and schizophrenia.  The only true highlight is an edited and all too brief clip of South Park:  Bigger, Longer, and Uncut.If this is the best argument the facist/socialist factions living in the U.S. can make for gun control, then Americans will be bearing arms for a long, long time.  If there's some other argument being made here, good luck in finding it.I give Bowling for Columbine 1/2 star for the inclusion of the South Park clip which helped me to remember that there was a reality outside of Bowling for Columbine.",1,Is it a documentary or a psuedo-documentary/comedy?,1062115200,"08 29, 2003",2003,3184,"['Other', 'then', 'headache', 'mild', 'sense', 'bewilderment', 'only', 'thing', 'got', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'sense', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'huckster', 'shameless', 'self-promoter.While', 'trying', 'verify', 'Moore', 'facts', 'became', 'confused', 'Bowling', 'supposed', 'be', 'taken', 'serious', 'documentary', 'psuedo-docu-comedy', 'PDC', 'having', 'seen', 'documentaries', 'PDC', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'Bowling', 'one', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'film', 'go', 'become', 'coated', 'obscured', 'definition.Bowling', 'greatest', 'weakness', 'lack', 'focus', 'documentaries', 'PDC', 'generally', 'one', 'subject', 'group', 'subjects', 'connected', 'common', 'event/experience/belief', 'Bowling', 'subject', 'would', 'guess', 'be', 'Moore', 'Unfortunately', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'subject', 'nowhere', 'as', 'witty', 'must', 'think', 'is.Moore', 'running', 'time', 'aimlessly', 'wandering', 'Flint', 'MI', 'Columbine', 'CO', 'L.A.', 'CA', 'focus', 'gun', 'violence', 'question', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'American', 'kill', 'other', 'Americans', 'presumably', 'guns', 'never', 'clearly', 'established', 'Moore', 'talking', 'murder', 'general', 'murders', 'involving', 'guns', '.Random', 'facts', 'are', 'thrown', 'viewer', 'presumably', 'support', 'Moore', 'argument', 'maybe', 'just', 'throw', 'random', 'facts', 'audience.It', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'white', 'man', 'fault', 'fact', 'short', 'cartoon', 'blaming', 'white', 'male', 'Puritans', 'slavery', 'KKK', 'NRA', 'current', 'murder', 'rate', 'U.S.', 'once', 'again', 'presumably', 'gun', 'related', 'murders', 'only', 'coherent', 'part', 'mess', 'fact', 'think', 'cartoon', 'short', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'movie', 'sense', 'word', 'Anyway', 'white', 'men', 'are', 'blamed', 'slavery', 'U.S.', 'white', 'men', 'particular', 'mention', 'other', 'country', 'involvement', 'slave', 'trade', 'made', 'not', 'even', 'mentioned', 'slavery', 'still', 'going', 'today', 'Black', 'black', 'slavery', 'Sudan', 'kinds', 'sex', 'slavery', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'Middle', 'East.Moore', 'have', 'point', 'how', 'U.S.', 'news', 'media', 'politicians', 'scare', 'American', 'public', 'state', 'learned', 'helplessness', 'same', 'not', 'true', 'Canada', 'Europe', 'never', 'anywhere', 'point', 'Maybe', 'simple', 'comparison', 'U.S.', 'Canadian', 'constitutions', 'role', 'press', 'given', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'instructive', 'Moore', 'eagerness', 'blame', 'America', 'first', 'never', 'opportunity.The', 'movie', 'called', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'only', 'thing', 'documented', 'Moore', 'extension', 'U.S.', 'left', 'descent', 'bitterness', 'schizophrenia', 'only', 'true', 'highlight', 'edited', 'too', 'brief', 'clip', 'South', 'Park', 'Bigger', 'Longer', 'Uncut.If', 'best', 'argument', 'facist/socialist', 'factions', 'living', 'U.S.', 'can', 'make', 'gun', 'control', 'then', 'Americans', 'will', 'be', 'bearing', 'arms', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'other', 'argument', 'being', 'made', 'here', 'good', 'luck', 'finding', 'it.I', 'give', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', '1/2', 'star', 'inclusion', 'South', 'Park', 'clip', 'helped', 'remember', 'was', 'reality', 'Bowling', 'Columbine']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

739272,A3KDGJX43RU5MK,B00008DDVU,D. W. MacKenzie,"[50, 195]","The 'facts' presented in this movie deserve special attention. The reason for this is that Moore deliberately misleads his audience. For instance, he emphasizes the fact that more than 11,000 Americans die from guns every year. How many of these people were shot by the police while committing a violent crime? He does not say. How many of these people were shot by private citizens while commiting a crime? He does not say. How many of these people committed suicide? He does not say.When anybody uses a gun in self-defense and in so doing protects an innocent life that is a good thing- and makes the case for private gun ownership. Every suicide is a tragedy. But people will commit suicide with or without guns. Moore obscures the facts by citing aggregate data.For evidence, Moore relies primarily on anecdotes that depict illegitimate uses of guns. Sure, there are people who will commit violent crimes. That is why having guns legal is a good idea. Honest people who want an effective means of self-defense need guns, and handguns in particular.Moore interviewed the weirdest gun owners he could find. It is no surprise that, in a country of close to 300 million people, Moore could find five or ten gun owners who were very strange. So what? There are millions of gun owners who are just normal people.Moore took on Charelton Heston in this movie. Heston is just an actor and a spokesman. Moore could have taken on John Lott instead. Lott is a scholar who did a county by county study on guns. What were his results? Private gun ownership leads to less violent crime and makes honest people safer. Of course, not everyone is safer- criminals are significantly less safe when states adopt concealed carry laws. This is what the statistics show. Lott is the leading scholar on this issue. Moore could have interviewed him, but he is not interested in the real facts.Moore contends that fear is the reason for Americas' gun death rate. Supposedly, we are all scared, so we get guns and then as we panick from all of this fear, we shoot each other. He emphasizes the fear that white Americans supposedly have for black Americans. Does he list data from any study or survey? No. He shows us a cartoon instead. Anyone over the age of eight who takes this seriously should seek professional help. He claims that the government is scaring us. He claims that the media is scaring us. He claims that 9-11 is scaring us into shooting each other too. Where is his proof? He has none. He makes these claims without substantiating them.He claims that Canadians, have guns but not fear. How does he prove this? He asked several Canadians. He also found several Canadians who did not lock their doors. Assuming that he did not stage these things, what does this prove? Are we supposed to infer something about entire nations simply because he talked to a couple of people and opened several doors?There is fear at work here. Moore finds the creepiest gun owners to scare us. Moore uses a few tragedies- Columbine and Flint in particular- to scare us. Never mind about the millions of murders, rapes, beatings, thefts, and other crimes that private guns prevent. He uses the absolute worst examples of private gun use and the strangest gun owners to scare us- and then has the nerve to claim that gun violence derives from others who try to scare us.There is more than fear mongering in this movie. Moore is also a shameless demagogue. Moore takes two victims from Columbine to KMART. He does this in order to pressure this company into ending its sales of handgun ammunition. He also shows the father of one who died at Columbine. Never mind about the victims of violent crime in places like NYC and Washington DC. These places ban guns, thus leaving decent people at the mercy of violent thugs. Never mind about the thousands who get murdered or brutalized in these illegal gun/high crime areas. Never mind about the facts. Never mind about the truth. Moore is out to play upon people emotions and fears, and will stop at nothing to do it. He could look at the general statistics on gun ownership and crime, but he prefers to exploit the suffering of two Columbine victims. His aim clearly is to evoke strong emotions while suppressing critical thought.Moore also ignores a major source of violent crime in American. There was an increase in gun violence during the prohibition of alcohol. This gun violence ended when The war on alcohol ended. Now the war on marijuana has gangs shooting it out with each other and the police again. We can end much violent crime and greatly reduce that 11,000+ death statistic figure he cites by legalizing marijuana. Moore ignores this fact.Bowling for Columbine is a shallow and shameless attempt to demagogue the gun issue. He uses selective, misleading, and anecdotal data to provoke fear of guns and anger against gun rights advocates. He evades the strongest advocates of gun rights so as to avoid having to deal with real arguments and data. He flails at straw men because the facts are against him. Moore sets a new standard for shameless demagoguery and misinformation with this movie. In fact, he is so brazen in the way he tries to scare and manipulate his audience that only closed-minded ideologues will take him seriously. Thinking people will see through his charade easily.",1,Not for Thinkers,1044576000,"02 7, 2003",2003,5317,"[""'facts"", 'presented', 'movie', 'deserve', 'special', 'attention', 'reason', 'Moore',

Callaway,"[6, 8]","While there are no words, nor is there any film that can alleviate the hurt and the sorrow that the people of Littleton, Colorado carry with them every day, talking about ""why"" is imperative to the healing process.  Having asked this question to himself, Michael Moore began looking into the culture that could birth such a violent incident.  This film travels through Moore's own thought process into what he believes is the root cause of much of the violence in society today: Fear.Mr. Moore believes that the United States was born of fear, and that the culture of fear is a catalyst in the American propensity towards violence.  The murder rate in the United States is ten times that of our neighbors to the north, and a rate several times that of many other western nations.  Many of these countries have far fewer guns as the citizenry is not allowed to possess firearms.  Canada, on the other hand, is much like America in that a person can own a wide assortment of guns.Moore's previous works were more concise and collected; more to the point.  Bowling for Columbine was Moore coming to his own conclusions, not having them completely formed in his own mind.  This made for a somewhat scattered film at times, but it also made for a film that was very human; very real.Problems came in the fact that Moore often asked questions of people who really could not answer.  Some inquiries could not be answered for business reasons and some for the fact that the questions themselves were simply unanswerable.  While many of the concepts, people, and organizations that were brought into question in the film, were brought up for valid reasons, the attack on K-Mart was simply out of line and sensational.  Moore was guilty of his own criticism and used media tactics to corner the retailer into submission.Aside from the few minor contradictory issues that came up through the film, it was spectacular.  Bowling for Columbine brought into question the systemic reasons for the violence in America.  He brought light onto the idea that the culture of fear is perpetuated by the media and by the government. Some of the most insightful moments of the film actually came from shock-rocker Marilyn Manson.  As one of the primary targets of the religious right during the aftermath of the Columbine tragedy, Manson was amazingly understanding of the people, and expressed his feelings over why violence continues.One of the most memorable concepts that resonated throughout the film was that of the NRA's tendency to arrive in areas in the wake of terrible events.  The NRA came to Denver within a month of the Columbine tragedy, and then within a week of the shooting death of Kayla Rolland in a Flint Michigan elementary school, even after pleas for them to stay away.  Charlton Heston and the NRA showed an amazing amount of insensitivity in their presence in these places.  While they have the right to be there, it showed how far they are willing to go, and how much they really do not care who they hurt in their wake.  They refused to give a grief-stricken community time to heal.The film did have its problems, but it was amazingly powerful.  It was very emotional. Though it was apparent that this film was a ""work in progress,"" while Moore himself sorted out why he thought there was such excessive violence in America, it came to rather concise points.  This is a film, no matter what a persons political beliefs are, that should be seen.  It will provoke thought, one way or another.epc",4,The Culture of Fear . . . .,1061510400,"08 22, 2003",2003,3497,"['are', 'words', 'there', 'film', 'can', 'alleviate', 'hurt', 'sorrow', 'people', 'Littleton', 'Colorado', 'carry', 'day', 'talking', 'why', 'imperative', 'healing', 'process', 'Having', 'asked', 'question', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'began', 'looking', 'culture', 'could', 'birth', 'violent', 'incident', 'film', 'Moore', 'own', 'thought', 'process', 'what', 'root', 'cause', 'much', 'violence', 'society', 'today', 'Fear.Mr', 'Moore', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'born', 'fear', 'culture', 'fear', 'catalyst', 'American', 'propensity', 'towards', 'violence', 'murder', 'rate', 'United', 'States', 'ten', 'times', 'neighbors', 'north', 'rate', 'several', 'times', 'many', 'other', 'western', 'nations', 'Many', 'countries', 'have', 'far', 'fewer', 'guns', 'citizenry', 'not', 'allowed', 'possess', 'firearms', 'Canada', 'other', 'hand', 'much', 'America', 'person', 'can', 'own', 'wide', 'assortment', 'guns.Moore', 'previous', 'works', 'were', 'more', 'concise', 'collected', 'more', 'point', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'was', 'Moore', 'coming', 'own', 'conclusions', 'not', 'having', 'completely', 'formed', 'own', 'mind', 'made', 'somewhat', 'scattered', 'film', 'times', 'also', 'made', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'human', 'very', 'came', 'fact', 'Moore', 'often', 'asked', 'questions', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'could', 'not', 'answer', 'inquiries', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'answered', 'business', 'reasons', 'fact', 'questions', 'were', 'simply', 'unanswerable', 'many', 'concepts', 'people', 'organizations', 'were', 'brought', 'question', 'film', 'were', 'brought', 'up', 'valid', 'reasons', 'attack', 'K-Mart', 'was', 'simply', 'line', 'sensational', 'Moore', 'was', 'guilty', 'own', 'criticism', 'used', 'media', 'tactics', 'corner', 'retailer', 'submission.Aside', 'few', 'minor', 'contradictory', 'issues', 'came', 'up', 'film', 'was', 'spectacular', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'brought', 'question', 'systemic', 'reasons', 'violence', 'America', 'brought', 'light', 'idea', 'culture', 'fear', 'perpetuated', 'media', 'government', 'most', 'insightful', 'moments', 'film', 'actually', 'came', 'shock-rocker', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'one', 'primary', 'targets', 'religious', 'right', 'aftermath', 'Columbine', 'tragedy', 'Manson', 'was', 'amazingly', 'understanding', 'people', 'expressed', 'feelings', 'why', 'violence', 'continues.One', 'most', 'memorable', 'concepts', 'resonated', 'film', 'was', 'NRA', 'tendency', 'arrive', 'areas', 'wake', 'terrible', 'events', 'NRA', 'came', 'Denver', 'month', 'Columbine', 'tragedy', 'then', 'week', 'shooting', 'death', 'Kayla', 'Rolland', 'Flint', 'Michigan', 'elementary', 'school', 'even', 'pleas', 'stay', 'away', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'NRA', 'showed', 'amazing', 'amount', 'insensitivity', 'presence', 'places', 'have', 'right', 'be', 'there', 'showed', 'how', 'far', 'are', 'willing', 'go', 'how', 'much', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'who', 'hurt', 'wake', 'refused', 'give', 'grief-stricken', 'community', 'time', 'heal.The', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'problems', 'was', 'amazingly', 'powerful', 'was', 'very', 'emotional', 'was', 'apparent', 'film', 'was', 'work', 'progress', 'Moore', 'sorted', 'out', 'why', 'thought', 'there', 'was', 'such', 'excessive', 'violence', 'America', 'came', 'rather', 'concise', 'points', 'film', 'matter', 'what', 'persons', 'political', 'beliefs', 'are', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'will', 'provoke', 'thought', 'one', 'way', 'another.epc']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

Mr. Moore asks the guestion why are we violent people after reading the various right-wing reviews damning the film and bringing in their ""racial""  or gun statistics he never did say he was against guns, he asked why we are  a violent country and he succeeds mightly asking tough questions as my mother says the ""truth hurts"" even though he spliced lot of information, took some liberties particularly on Canada (i love canada and hope to live there one day as soon as they get an nfl football team lol) Frankly the Heston interview brillant, this man is a racist  plain and simple, alzihmers or not he is no invailid and took the interview so he is to blame also,  he has been in the buisness over 50 years and should have known better than to deal with a reporter asking loaded questions. And to those right-wingers spewing their racist venom, they are frankly wrong on all counts, stats are very funny things depending on where you got them and can be twisted for anyone's bias.

The movie had so much reality to it, it had so much humor, it had so much.....seriousness to it. It had everything a big Hollywood movie has except more real.After director/writer/producer Micheal Moore was blasted at the Oscars for his verbal attacks on America I just knew that I had to see his film on the topic of gun control. When I finally saw it when it was on it's last breath in Manhattan I was really glad that I payed ten dollars to see it.It starts off with Micheal Moore going into a bank. The bank says that if you open a special account you get a free gun. It then rolls off to people opionions about owning guns, using guns for protection, and the 2nd amendement which enables every man to bear arms.We are even treated to a five minute cartoon about American History.The film had all different kinds of angles. There was Micheal Moore private filming. There were special news reels and footage. What had me interested the most was how when they were talking about the Columbine shootings they showed the actual tapes that the school had. We saw the kids being forced to go under the tables, we saw the two kids responsible for the shootings looking around and mabey even communcating with one another. I was wondering throughout the movie why anybody would want to do that. Who wound get angry enough to kill people who are of a different race, religion, and ethics just because they are different. It was a movie that I was thinking about even after I left the theatre.We were provided with interviews with people who lived in the area, people in other countries, and celebrites like NRA president and actor Charlten Heston, singing Marilyn Manson, and South Park co-creator Matt Stone who went to Columbine School. We saw the large comparisions between the murders and deaths from guns to our country to the amount of others. In Canada there are 65 people who are killed by guns a year. In America 11,127 people are killed by guns per year. In Cananda, people go to bed with doors unlocked. Moore even opened various doors of houses in Cananda to prove this.I am just naming a few things that this movie does.

Our standard of living may be one of the best, but our quality of life is close to nil in comparison with that of other First World countries (Canada, Japan, Scandanavians, the UK, etc.)---not when 90% of the populace is brainwashed by a capitalist-driven media and right-wing ideologues in both government and industry, so that we live in a state of continual fear and compulsive consumerism.Yes, Moore does take a few liberties here and there with statistics (neglecting to compare murder rates between different industrialized countries on a per-capita basis, for instance---but either way the US is still way way ahead of everybody else).  But overall his portrayal of America is just spot-on: we are a nation of control freaks who are out of control, a bunch of dogs barking at mirrors and chasing their own tails.The question is, will this film really reach the Nameless Majority of simple-minded suckers and rednecks out there on Main Street who have made popular men of such flaming morons as Rush Limbaugh and George W.

739279,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00008DDVU,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE (2002) is probably Michael Moore's strongest yet most scattershot documentary. It is certainly the one that gained him national attention and a broader fame - well deserved. Yet it seems obvious from watching this film again right after the Tucson shootings that Moore really had a lot to say that we may have missed til now.The title is a reference to the horrible tragedy at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, in 1999 - the two students who killed and wounded so many were fond of bowling, which was also an elective P.E. class which they both took. Moore takes a head-on look at what ails society and causes such tragedies. However, I think he is a bit lacking in purpose.Here, Moore takes on what we now know are his big pet peeves: health care, unemployment, corporate greed, hypocrisy, his hometown, guns, and his big love/hate relationship with Canada. It seemed somehow inappropriate to address so many things when this was supposed to be a documentary about the Columbine shootings.Though Moore had two wounded students from the attacks, and he spoke to a boy who had been friends with the shooters, at no time did he really make this film about Columbine. He never spoke to anyone else involved. Instead, he went on a severe critique of this nation's love affair with guns and violence. The whole film set out to show how violence (therefore guns) are to blame for everything.Not a bad message. Yet his confrontation with the notorious figurehead of the NRA, Charleton Heston, is exemplary. Moore had the nerve to ask Heston to apologize to all shooting victims, especially those in Littleton and in Flint, Michigan, where another terrible school shooting occurred. Moore had no right.From an anthropological and sociological viewpoint, Moore is correct that we mass-produce fear propaganda to get things done. He may be right that it causes much violence.He forgets to teach that we miss the opportunity to help each other, be good to each other and respect each other. Instead we see not only fear, violence and guns on the news: we hear how BAD we are. We are too fat. We are too mean. We are workaholics unless we are lazy bums. We poison the environment and it is everyone's fault that we are killing the planet and each other. ENOUGH!Can't we see - especially those like Moore - that we can all do a lot better without the slamming and blaming? Was it really necessary for him to drag the two Columbine survivors to Flint so they could demand K-Mart take action about the ammunition they used to sell? The jape worked: Moore got K-Mart to instate a policy that within 90 days they would cease to sell ammo.Good for him.The question is, was it worth it? Was it worthwhile just because the Columbine shooters had what Moore called ""21 cent bullets from K-Mart""? It is not the fault of the sport shooter or the hunter if people are getting shot and killed. Blame the NRA, bastards that they are, but not the innocent citizens who have done nothing wrong.Moore does not seem to get that; he brags about being a lifetime member of the NRA. He admits he was raised and went along with the gun culture - and as he shows in the movie, he clearly knows how to handle a rifle.This film is too important, but I think it demonstrates how NOT to think as well as it shows what must be done. Moore went on to do better concentrated documentaries and I admire them all. His biggest weakness in COLUMBINE is his broad-stroke approach to blame.We need to stop blaming, and start evolving.",4,Crying for Columbine is more like it,1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,3520,"['BOWLING', 'FOR', 'COLUMBINE', '2002', 'probably', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'strongest', 'yet', 'most', 'scattershot', 'documentary', 'certainly', 'one', 'gained', 'national', 'attention', 'broader', 'fame', 'well', 'deserved', 'obvious', 'watching', 'film', 'again', 'right', 'Tucson', 'shootings', 'Moore', 'really', 'had', 'lot', 'say', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'til', 'now.The', 'title', 'reference', 'horrible', 'tragedy', 'Columbine', 'High', 'School', 'Littleton', 'Colorado', '1999', 'two', 'students', 'who', 'killed', 'wounded', 'so', 'many', 'were', 'fond', 'bowling', 'was', 'also', 'elective', 'P.E', 'class', 'took', 'Moore', 'head-on', 'look', 'what', 'society', 'causes', 'such', 'tragedies', 'However', 'think', 'bit', 'lacking', 'purpose.Here', 'Moore', 'what', 'now', 'know', 'are', 'big', 'pet', 'peeves', 'health', 'care', 'unemployment', 'corporate', 'greed', 'hypocrisy', 'hometown', 'guns', 'big', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'Canada', 'seemed', 'somehow', 'inappropriate', 'address', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'when', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'documentary', 'Columbine', 'shootings.Though', 'Moore', 'had', 'two', 'wounded', 'students', 'attacks', 'spoke', 'boy', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'friends', 'shooters', 'time', 'did', 'really', 'make', 'film', 'Columbine', 'never', 'spoke', 'anyone', 'else', 'involved', 'Instead', 'went', 'severe', 'critique', 'nation', 'love', 'affair', 'guns', 'violence', 'whole', 'film', 'set', 'out', 'show', 'how', 'violence', 'guns', 'are', 'blame', 'everything.Not', 'bad', 'message', 'confrontation', 'notorious', 'figurehead', 'NRA', 'Charleton', 'Heston', 'exemplary', 'Moore', 'had', 'nerve', 'ask', 'Heston', 'apologize', 'shooting', 'victims', 'especially', 'Littleton', 'Flint', 'Michigan', 'where', 'terrible', 'school', 'shooting', 'occurred', 'Moore', 'had', 'right.From', 'anthropological', 'sociological', 'viewpoint', 'Moore', 'correct', 'mass-produce', 'fear', 'propaganda', 'get', 'things', 'done', 'may', 'be', 'right', 'much', 'violence.He', 'forgets', 'teach', 'miss', 'opportunity', 'help', 'other', 'be', 'good', 'other', 'respect', 'other', 'Instead', 'see', 'not', 'only', 'fear', 'violence', 'guns', 'news', 'hear', 'how', 'BAD', 'are', 'are', 'too', 'fat', 'are', 'too', 'mean', 'are', 'workaholics', 'are', 'lazy', 'bums', 'poison', 'environment', 'everyone', 'fault', 'are', 'killing', 'planet', 'other', 'ENOUGH', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'especially', 'Moore', 'can', 'do', 'lot', 'better', 'slamming', 'blaming', 'Was', 'really', 'necessary', 'drag', 'two', 'Columbine', 'survivors', 'Flint', 'could', 'demand', 'K-Mart', 'take', 'action', 'ammunition', 'used', 'sell', 'jape', 'worked', 'Moore', 'got', 'K-Mart', 'instate', 'policy', '90', 'days', 'would', 'cease', 'sell', 'ammo.Good', 'him.The', 'question', 'was', 'Was', 'worthwhile', 'just', 'Columbine', 'shooters', 'had', 'what', 'Moore', 'called', '21', 'cent', 'bullets', 'K-Mart', 'not', 'fault', 'sport', 'shooter', 'hunter', 'people', 'are', 'getting', 'shot', 'killed', 'Blame', 'NRA', 'bastards', 'are', 'not', 'innocent', 'citizens', 'who', 'have', 'done', 'nothing', 'wrong.Moore', 'not', 'seem', 'get', 'being', 'lifetime', 'member', 'NRA', 'was', 'raised', 'went', 'gun', 'culture', 'movie', 'clearly', 'how', 'handle', 'rifle.This', 'film', 'too', 'important', 'think', 'how', 'NOT', 'think', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'Moore', 'went', 'do', 'better', 'concentrated', 'documentaries', 'admire', 'biggest', 'weakness', 'COLUMBINE', 'broad-stroke', 'approach', 'blame.We', 'need', 'stop', 'blaming', 'start', 'evolving']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

This movie pains a lot of individuals cause of the subject matter it deals with, and many would like to turn a blind eye to it.  Well, time to open your eyes, America.  Though, for some reason, even though Moore makes stirring films, it's a shame that it basically has changed nothing.  The public at large has already been brainwashed, and most forget once they leave the theater or turn off the telly that there is a world of hurt out there, and Moore is trying to turn a mirror on OUR society and say, here's the problem.  I hate to make analogies, but this film reminds me of that commercial where the fella is talking about quitting gambling, and the camera pulls back to reveal that it's him talking to himself in the mirror.  America, for the most part, loves to watch violence, myself certainly not being excluded, yet we do nothing to stop it, for the most part.  When we hear about it, we say what a shame, yet on the outside our actions don't reflect how most of us really feel deep down inside.  It's a conflict of interest to most.  Most would prefer to lock their doors and shut out the world, and Mr. Moore hits the nail right on the head with that one.  Most don't realize the world of hurt until it comes crashing down into their own worlds.  Violence and tragedy affect everyone, everywhere.  There's not much we can do, but we can change how we deal with one another, and that's a step.

739284,A3IPHLD7B59IJ3,B00008DDVU,"Enigma ""Cheers""","[12, 22]","This movie has some good points, some bad points and some real ugly problems.GOOD*  The best point made my Michael Moore is that the liberal media uses scare tactics to help push fear into the homes, hearts and brains of susceptible people. A terrorized public is of course the biggest tool of socialism.*  He points out that Canadians also have a high gun ownership percentage without the resultant crime. He asks why but never answers this important question &fnof;*  The presentation that the liberal media portrays crime as being black induced while the majority of Americans do not.BAD*  A completely false representation of NRA policy of children and guns; who&iexcl;s responsible.*  His theory that the columbine shootings were inspired by the Kosovo bombings is a little ridiculous?*  Michael Moore&iexcl;s incessant comments that people should not work.&iexcl;Working has no Merit&iexcl;&iexcl;What is the point of working&iexcl;&iexcl;Working causes children to shoot other children&iexcl;&iexcl;People are forced to work&iexcl;*  Falsely implying that a single parent with one child who made $40,000 - $50,000 a year was poor.UGLY*  The betrayal of the Lockheed-martin plant making Nuclear Missiles. The plant makes rockets for space exploration. This is such a blatant falsification, you can&iexcl;t possibly call this a documentary. It is more of a mockumentary in the lines of Spinal Tap.*  Moore consistently asked why we are (Americans) different. But he never once examined the two perpetrators of the columbine shooting. The Home Security consultant probably asked the most pertinent questions in the whole program but it they went unanswered.Why were these children so viscous?Why such predatory action?Why did they do this killing?*  Moore states that &iexcl;we will never know why they did it&iexcl; He never once examines the diaries that detailed not only how but WHY these two boys did it.*  Moore never once mentioned the boys targeting of Christians and their almost metaphysical hatred of any person who proclaimed an affinity to Christianity.*  The extremely false history of the United States. Why was this cartoon placed into this movie? One really has to wonder about Moore&iexcl;s hatred of this country and why he felt it so necessary to put America down.In the end you have left with a very vapid felling inside after watching this show. It answers no real questions and it gives no solutions. It seemed like a piece of propaganda without the propaganda.Moore&iexcl;s little escapade in Canada where he shows how safe it is by how many people leave their door unlocked is one example of this shows lacking substance. But just to see if it is any different I just went around my neighborhood. I live in what has been called the murder capital of the United States.

739289,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B00008DDVU,Erik North,"[5, 8]","Love him or hate him, Michael Moore is what he is--a muckraking gadfly of very liberal political persuasion--and there is nothing that anyone can do about it.  But make no mistake about it: He loves America, and is concerned for it.  His crusading populism dates back to 1989's ROGER AND ME; and his brand of gentile guerilla filmmaking reached a peak in 2002 with BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE, which won that year's Oscar for Best Documentary Feature.Here, Moore, who ironically enough is a lifelong member of the National Rifle Association, takes a look at the culture of fear in our country that makes certain people take up guns for whatever reason they deem necessary and use the Second Amendment of the Constitution as their brace.  The title of this film refers to what Eric Harris and Dylan Kleibold were doing on the morning of April 20, 1999 prior to them entering Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado and snuffing out the lives of twelve students and one teacher before turning their guns on themselves.In this 2-hour expose, and utilizing his trademark brand of dark humor laced with barely contained anger, Moore talks with those who were at the scene of the horrific events at Columbine, as well as former Columbine student and ""South Park"" creator Matt Stone, and shock rocker Marilyn Manson (who was used as a convenient whipping boy because the Columbine shooters were big fans of his), among others, and takes us inside the Michigan militia, whose obsessions with guns attracted Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols (the guys who blew up the federal building in Oklahoma City in April 1995), and talks with an indignant James Nichols (Terry's brother), who just looks and talks like the sort of gun-crazed wacko the media make him out to be.But Moore, typically, doesn't stop there.  He indicts the American media for putting fear and loathing into people for showing gun crimes done (seemingly) exclusively by gang-bangers who happen to be black; he cites statistics that show that America has a higher murder rate than any ""civilized"" nation in the world; and he shows the social and economic conditions around his own hometown of Flint, Michigan that led to a young little girl named Kayla being accidentally shot by a classmate with a gun he found lying around his mother's home.And that's still not enough.  For despite being a member of the NRA, he calls to the carpet that very same organization for holding its annual meeting in Denver in 1999, a mere few miles from Columbine, and later in Flint, just weeks after Kayla's death.  And in the end, he asks some very tough questions of actor and former NRA president Charlton Heston about why it is that other countries with proportionally as many guns to people as America have much lower murder rates than we do.  Heston boils it down to our nation having ""a history of violence and blood on its hands"" (no surprise there) and ""mixed ethnicities"" (coming from a man who marched with Martin Luther King in Washington in 1963, that last comment *is* a shock; but given his political turn towards the far right in the 1970s, that too ends up as being less of a shock than it otherwise might be).Moore doesn't offer any easy answers for why America's obsession with guns is so great, because there just aren't any.  But he does strongly point the finger at our violent past and present, coming right up to and slightly beyond the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and says that this past and our present fears of gangs and terrorists spawning a mindset of packing heat isn't going to make America a safer nation.  This is a totally reasonable conclusion that those who would condemn Moore for this film (and for that matter for FAHRENHEIT 9/11 which, given how *this* film briefly touches on 9/11, they should have seen coming) don't want to come to grips with, probably because it requires them to look in the mirror and see the face they don't really want to see.BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE categorically does NOT condemn the Second Amendment or the right for people to bear firearms.  Nor does it slander either Heston or the NRA.  It indicts the political, social, and economic culture in America that makes incidents like Columbine and 9/11 not only possible, but inevitable.  And on that note, Moore, with his usual trademark techniques, has more than done his job as a muckraker, a filmmaker, and a true example of American patriotism.",5,Shoot To Kill,1132531200,"11 21, 2005",2005,4396,"['Love', 'hate', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'what', 'muckraking', 'gadfly', 'very', 'liberal', 'political', 'persuasion', 'nothing', 'anyone', 'can', 'do', 'make', 'mistake', 'America', 'concerned', 'crusading', 'populism', 'dates', 'back', '1989', 'ROGER', 'ME', 'brand', 'gentile', 'guerilla', 'filmmaking', 'reached', 'peak', '2002', 'BOWLING', 'FOR', 'COLUMBINE', 'won', 'year', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Documentary', 'Feature.Here', 'Moore', 'who', 'ironically', 'enough', 'lifelong', 'member', 'National', 'Rifle', 'Association', 'look', 'culture', 'fear', 'country', 'certain', 'people', 'take', 'up', 'guns', 'reason', 'deem', 'necessary', 'use', 'Second', 'Amendment', 'Constitution', 'brace', 'title', 'film', 'refers', 'what', 'Eric', 'Harris', 'Dylan', 'Kleibold', 'were', 'doing', 'morning', 'April', '20', '1999', 'prior', 'entering', 'Columbine', 'High', 'School', 'Littleton', 'Colorado', 'snuffing', 'out', 'lives', 'twelve', 'students', 'one', 'teacher', 'turning', 'guns', 'themselves.In', '2-hour', 'expose', 'utilizing', 'trademark', 'brand', 'dark', 'humor', 'laced', 'barely', 'contained', 'anger', 'Moore', 'talks', 'who', 'were', 'scene', 'horrific', 'events', 'Columbine', 'as', 'well', 'former', 'Columbine', 'student', 'South', 'Park', 'creator', 'Matt', 'Stone', 'shock', 'rocker', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'who', 'was', 'used', 'convenient', 'whipping', 'boy', 'Columbine', 'shooters', 'were', 'big', 'fans', 'others', 'Michigan', 'militia', 'obsessions', 'guns', 'attracted', 'Timothy', 'McVeigh', 'Terry', 'Nichols', 'guys', 'who', 'blew', 'up', 'federal', 'building', 'Oklahoma', 'City', 'April', '1995', 'talks', 'indignant', 'James', 'Nichols', 'Terry', 'brother', 'who', 'just', 'talks', 'sort', 'gun-crazed', 'wacko', 'media', 'make', 'be.But', 'Moore', 'typically', ""n't"", 'stop', 'there', 'American', 'media', 'putting', 'fear', 'loathing', 'people', 'showing', 'gun', 'crimes', 'done', 'seemingly', 'exclusively', 'gang-bangers', 'who', 'happen', 'be', 'black', 'statistics', 'show', 'America', 'higher', 'murder', 'rate', 'civilized', 'nation', 'world', 'social', 'economic', 'conditions', 'own', 'hometown', 'Flint', 'Michigan', 'led', 'young', 'little', 'girl', 'named', 'Kayla', 'being', 'accidentally', 'shot', 'classmate', 'gun', 'found', 'lying', 'mother', 'home.And', 'still', 'not', 'enough', 'being', 'member', 'NRA', 'carpet', 'very', 'same', 'organization', 'holding', 'annual', 'meeting', 'Denver', '1999', 'mere', 'few', 'miles', 'Columbine', 'later', 'Flint', 'just', 'weeks', 'Kayla', 'death', 'end', 'very', 'tough', 'questions', 'actor', 'former', 'NRA', 'president', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'why', 'other', 'countries', 'proportionally', 'many', 'guns', 'people', 'America', 'have', 'much', 'lower', 'murder', 'rates', 'do', 'Heston', 'down', 'nation', 'having', 'history', 'violence', 'blood', 'hands', 'surprise', 'there', 'mixed', 'ethnicities', 'coming', 'man', 'who', 'marched', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Washington', '1963', 'last', 'comment', '*is*', 'shock', 'given', 'political', 'turn', 'towards', 'far', 'right', '1970s', 'too', 'up', 'being', 'less', 'shock', 'otherwise', 'might', 'be', '.Moore', ""n't"", 'offer', 'easy', 'answers', 'why', 'America', 'obsession', 'guns', 'so', 'great', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'strongly', 'point', 'finger', 'violent', 'past', 'present', 'coming', 'right', 'slightly', '9/11', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'past', 'present', 'fears', 'gangs', 'terrorists', 'spawning', 'mindset', 'packing', 'heat', ""n't"", 'going', 'make', 'America', 'safer', 'nation', 'totally', 'reasonable', 'conclusion', 'who', 'would', 'condemn', 'Moore', 'film', 'matter', 'FAHRENHEIT', '9/11', 'given', 'how', '*this*', 'film', 'briefly', 'touches', '9/11', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'coming', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'come', 'grips', 'probably', 'look', 'mirror', 'see', 'face', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'see.BOWLING', 'FOR', 'COLUMBINE', 'categorically', 'NOT', 'condemn', 'Second', 'Amendment', 'right', 'people', 'bear', 'firearms', 'slander', 'Heston', 'NRA', 'political', 'social', 'economic', 'culture', 'America', 'incidents', 'Columbine', '9/11', 'not', 'only', 'possible', 'inevitable', 'note', 'Moore', 'usual', 'trademark', 'techniques', 'more', 'done', 'job', 'muckraker', 'filmmaker', 'true', 'example', 'American', 'patriotism']",Bowling For Columbine VHS
739290,A1BDPRQ7BEUNLP,B00008DDVU,"Erik Olson ""Seeker Reviews""","[8, 12]","I'm not a huge fan of Mr. Moore or his politics, but I check out opposing viewpoints to reexamine my presuppositions and alter or strengthen them as necessary.  I've heard a lot of general scuttlebutt about him (loud, liberal, etc.), and read the Amazon reviews concerning &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;, so I decided to see for myself what all the controversy was about.The movie's thesis boils down to this: Americans exist in a state of fear, so they use guns to kill anyone who's a real or perceived threat.  What generates this climate of high anxiety?  It's stoked by the media, with continual coverage of violent crime, corporate mischief, natural disasters, and so on, along with the government and its endless travel advisories and terror alerts.  How do Americans cope?  With excessive material consumption, encouraged by a constant media advertising blitz.  So, we live in perpetual fear, consume beyond our means to medicate ourselves, work at jobs we hate to fund our consumption, buy a gun or two to protect our precarious lifestyle, and cap anyone who messes with our precious consumables or threatens our means of buying them.  What a life.This seems to be a reasonable diagnosis of a national problem.  Marilyn Manson, an obvious and convenient scapegoat for the average person's dysfunctions, explains the cycle of fear, consumption, and violence quite well when questioned by Mr. Moore.  Just across the border, Mr. Moore establishes that our Canadian neighbors have about as many guns per household as we do.  But they don't blast away at each other nearly as much.  What's their secret?  A positive, laid-back frame of mind, as demonstrated (and encouraged) by a softer-edged media and mellow politicians.  Heck, they don't even lock their doors, as Mr. Moore demonstrates by walking in on a couple of unsuspecting Canucks.  So far, he's done a great job of identifying the existence of an American malady.  At this point in the film, I was prepared for an equally sound treatment of the logical solution:  Americans need a fundamental change of heart, or at least an attitude adjustment, eh.However, Mr. Moore does not examine an alteration of the American psyche as a possible remedy.  That would've elevated &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; to greatness.  Instead, he embarks on a crusade to get ammunition out of K-Mart stores and gets in the face of NRA president Charlton Heston.  Despite spending much of the film establishing internal motivations as the problem, Mr. Moore takes the easy way out by blaming guns instead of the people who use them against others.  What good does it do to focus on a symptom instead of the disease?  It will only manifest itself in a different way.  Using Mr. Moore's reasoning, we'd be better off getting rid of our television sets (not a bad idea, actually).Despite its flaws, I recommend that everyone see &quot;Bowling for Columbine.&quot;  Mr. Moore has done an excellent job of diagnosing an American problem.  However, anyone seeking thoughtful discourse or debate about a reasonable solution will have to look elsewhere.",3,"Good diagnosis, but falls short on the solution.",1089331200,"07 9, 2004",2004,3093,"[""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'politics', 'check', 'out', 'opposing', 'viewpoints', 'reexamine', 'presuppositions', 'alter', 'strengthen', 'necessary', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'lot', 'general', 'scuttlebutt', 'loud', 'liberal', 'etc', 'read', 'Amazon', 'concerning', 'quot', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'quot', 'decided', 'see', 'controversy', 'was', 'about.The', 'movie', 'thesis', 'down', 'Americans', 'exist', 'state', 'fear', 'use', 'guns', 'kill', 'anyone', 'who', 'real', 'perceived', 'threat', 'What', 'climate', 'high', 'anxiety', 'stoked', 'media', 'continual', 'coverage', 'violent', 'crime', 'corporate', 'mischief', 'natural', 'disasters', 'so', 'government', 'endless', 'travel', 'advisories', 'terror', 'alerts', 'How', 'do', 'Americans', 'cope', 'excessive', 'material', 'consumption', 'encouraged', 'constant', 'media', 'advertising', 'blitz', 'So', 'live', 'perpetual', 'fear', 'consume', 'means', 'medicate', 'ourselves', 'work', 'jobs', 'hate', 'fund', 'consumption', 'buy', 'gun', 'two', 'protect', 'precarious', 'lifestyle', 'cap', 'anyone', 'who', 'precious', 'consumables', 'means', 'buying', 'What', 'life.This', 'be', 'reasonable', 'diagnosis', 'national', 'problem', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'obvious', 'convenient', 'scapegoat', 'average', 'person', 'dysfunctions', 'cycle', 'fear', 'consumption', 'violence', 'quite', 'well', 'when', 'questioned', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'Just', 'border', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'Canadian', 'neighbors', 'have', 'as', 'many', 'guns', 'per', 'household', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'blast', 'away', 'other', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'What', 'secret', 'positive', 'laid-back', 'frame', 'mind', 'demonstrated', 'encouraged', 'softer-edged', 'media', 'mellow', 'politicians', 'Heck', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'lock', 'doors', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'walking', 'couple', 'unsuspecting', 'Canucks', 'So', 'far', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'identifying', 'existence', 'American', 'malady', 'point', 'film', 'was', 'prepared', 'equally', 'sound', 'treatment', 'logical', 'solution', 'Americans', 'need', 'fundamental', 'change', 'heart', 'least', 'attitude', 'adjustment', 'eh.However', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'not', 'examine', 'alteration', 'American', 'psyche', 'possible', 'remedy', 'would', ""'ve"", 'elevated', 'quot', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'quot', 'greatness', 'Instead', 'crusade', 'get', 'ammunition', 'K-Mart', 'stores', 'face', 'NRA', 'president', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'spending', 'much', 'film', 'establishing', 'internal', 'motivations', 'problem', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'easy', 'way', 'blaming', 'guns', 'instead', 'people', 'who', 'use', 'others', 'What', 'good', 'do', 'focus', 'symptom', 'instead', 'disease', 'will', 'only', 'manifest', 'different', 'way', 'Using', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'reasoning', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'getting', 'rid', 'television', 'sets', 'not', 'bad', 'idea', 'actually', '.Despite', 'flaws', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'see', 'quot', 'Bowling', 'Columbine.', 'quot', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'diagnosing', 'American', 'problem', 'However', 'anyone', 'seeking', 'thoughtful', 'discourse', 'debate', 'reasonable', 'solution', 'will', 'have', 'look', 'elsewhere']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

In addition to that, Moore's interview with Heston is also incredibly powerful, as Moore put the NRA President under a lot of fire.

739292,A17IDP37NM8TFJ,B00008DDVU,Eugene Chamson,"[15, 26]","Michael Moore raises important questions about violence in America, and offers some provocative answers.  Unfortunately, he is so clearly biased by his own political views, that his conclusions lack credibility, and ultimately the film degenerates into a political manifesto.  The clearest indication of this is that those who share Moore's political views love the film, while those who don't hate it.At first, the film seems to be an intelligent investigation into the question of why gun violence is so widespread in the U.S.  Using the tragedy of Columbine as a focal point, Moore explores the factors that might explain why, for example, the number of gun deaths is over 11,000 per year in the U.S., while being less than 100 in most other industrial nations.  This is a striking statistic, and the viewer will be eager to learn more.But this is no Frontline investigation.  The statistics and historical accounts are distorted, the interviews are staged to make some people look good and others look bad, and anecdotes are presented as generalized facts.  In short, it soon becomes apparent that the filmmaker is far from objective and probably had his mind made up about the topic before starting the film.There is nothing wrong with making a film with a point of view.  But then don't try to pass it off as a documentary.  It's the blurring of the line between objective reporting and proselytizing that makes this film so insidious.Moore has a way of interviewing those he doesn't like or agree with that is obviously staged to make them look bad, and he uses this technique shamelessly.  He peppers Charlton Heston and Dick Clark with questions that are really rude accusations, and then makes a big deal of the fact that they terminate the interview, as if somehow this is evidence of their guilt, rather than his rudeness.  He gets away with it because it is entertaining to watch.  At the same time,  Moore practically coddles Marilyn Manson and others that support his point of view and can be seen effusively agreeing with them on camera.Bottom line: this is a film about an important topic that will make you think, and is worth seeing, as long as you keep in mind that it is not a documentary, but rather an opinion piece staged as a documentary.",3,Provocative Film by an Overzealous Filmmaker,1053043200,"05 16, 2003",2003,2263,"['Michael', 'Moore', 'important', 'questions', 'violence', 'America', 'provocative', 'answers', 'Unfortunately', 'so', 'clearly', 'biased', 'own', 'political', 'views', 'conclusions', 'lack', 'credibility', 'ultimately', 'film', 'political', 'manifesto', 'clearest', 'indication', 'who', 'share', 'Moore', 'political', 'views', 'love', 'film', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'it.At', 'first', 'film', 'be', 'intelligent', 'investigation', 'question', 'why', 'gun', 'violence', 'so', 'widespread', 'U.S', 'Using', 'tragedy', 'Columbine', 'focal', 'point', 'Moore', 'factors', 'might', 'explain', 'why', 'example', 'number', 'gun', 'deaths', '11,000', 'year', 'U.S.', 'being', 'less', '100', 'most', 'other', 'industrial', 'nations', 'striking', 'statistic', 'viewer', 'will', 'be', 'eager', 'learn', 'more.But', 'Frontline', 'investigation', 'statistics', 'historical', 'accounts', 'are', 'distorted', 'interviews', 'are', 'staged', 'make', 'people', 'look', 'good', 'others', 'look', 'bad', 'anecdotes', 'are', 'presented', 'generalized', 'facts', 'short', 'soon', 'apparent', 'filmmaker', 'far', 'objective', 'probably', 'had', 'mind', 'made', 'up', 'topic', 'starting', 'film.There', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'making', 'film', 'point', 'view', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'pass', 'off', 'documentary', 'blurring', 'line', 'objective', 'reporting', 'proselytizing', 'film', 'so', 'insidious.Moore', 'way', 'interviewing', ""n't"", 'like', 'agree', 'obviously', 'staged', 'make', 'look', 'bad', 'technique', 'shamelessly', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Dick', 'Clark', 'questions', 'are', 'really', 'rude', 'accusations', 'then', 'big', 'deal', 'fact', 'terminate', 'interview', 'somehow', 'evidence', 'guilt', 'rather', 'rudeness', 'away', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'same', 'time', 'Moore', 'practically', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'others', 'support', 'point', 'view', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'effusively', 'agreeing', 'camera.Bottom', 'line', 'film', 'important', 'topic', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'worth', 'seeing', 'as', 'long', 'keep', 'mind', 'not', 'documentary', 'rather', 'opinion', 'piece', 'staged', 'documentary']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

Taylor ""GFT""","[11, 19]","Documentary film makers necessarily bring a certain point of view with them: it is there in the material they have selected, in what they show and do not show, in how they work their bits of film together to make a cohesive statement.  But while the vast majority of documentary film makers prefer to hide themselves behind the camera--and thus give the illusion of impartiality--Michael Moore does not.  Not only director but also narrator, interviewer, and visible front man, he has no qualm in letting you know right out of the gate that the point of view is his own from start to finish.Most people will probably agree that it is a gutsy thing to do, but that is probably ALL they are likely to agree upon about BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE.  Ask ten people what the film is about and you are likely to get ten different answers.  Ask the same ten whether they liked it or not and you will probably get two extremes: they either loved it or they hated it.  Those who love it tend to champion it as a powerful statement in favor of gun control.  Those who hate it tend to consider it an inaccurate attack on gun owners in general and the NRA in particular.But I think it is a mistake to see the film from either stance.  It is true that Moore has a lot to say about easy access to and irresponsible handling of firearms; it is also true that the NRA (not to mention then-president Charleton Heston) come in for a major beating at his hands.  But when all is said and done, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is no more &quot;about&quot; gun control or the NRA than it is about the infamous Columbine High School incident.  When you get right down to the marrow, Moore seems to be making a comment on how both politicians and corporations work to take advantage of the paranoia created in the citizenry by a mass media focused on what is sensational rather than upon what is actually important.There has been a lot of complaint that Moore has fiddled the facts to suit his agenda and that BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is riddled with inaccuracies.  Indeed, there are entire websites (most of them little more than badly researched hysterical rants) devoted to the exposure of these flaws.  But whether or not you buy into all or even most of Moore's data, it does seem to me that he has a valid overall point.  To throw it out on the basis of surface errors--or still worse, the bizarre idea that documentaries should reside in some rarefied atmosphere of absolute impartiality--is an even greater error than any inaccuracy or bias that exists in the film itself.Whether you actually agree with the film or not, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is truly one film that will hold your attention to the bitter end: often laugh-out-loud funny, wildly satirical, bitterly ironic, opinionated, thought-provoking, and extremely disquieting, it makes a powerful statement.  But I do have one complaint, and it is a significant one.  Moore doesn't seem to communicate any consistent idea re what he thinks we should do about any of it.How do we dispense with the media-fueled paranoia that leaves us vulnerable to corporate and political hucksters?  Obviously by critical rather than reactionary thinking, but this isn't really something that Moore specifically states in the course of the film.  Very well, but how do we break the cycle that encourages reactionary rather than critical thinking?  And to that question Moore has no answer at all.  When this open ended quality combines with the film's often brilliant but frequently scattered approach ... well, it just might leave you feeling none the wiser than you were when you came in.The DVD comes with several extras, some of them very interesting--most particularly the &quot;Return to Denver/Littleton Featurette,&quot; an interview with Joe Lockart, and an interview with Charlie Rose.  Final thought: more than worth seeing, but one way or another your reaction is likely to extreme.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",4,A Divisive Film: No Opinion is not an Option,1079222400,"03 14, 2004",2004,3919,"['Documentary', 'film', 'makers', 'necessarily', 'bring', 'certain', 'point', 'view', 'there', 'material', 'have', 'selected', 'what', 'show', 'do', 'not', 'show', 'how', 'work', 'bits', 'film', 'together', 'make', 'cohesive', 'statement', 'vast', 'majority', 'documentary', 'film', 'makers', 'prefer', 'hide', 'camera', 'thus', 'give', 'illusion', 'impartiality', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'not', 'Not', 'only', 'director', 'also', 'narrator', 'interviewer', 'visible', 'front', 'man', 'qualm', 'letting', 'know', 'right', 'gate', 'point', 'view', 'own', 'start', 'finish.Most', 'people', 'will', 'probably', 'agree', 'gutsy', 'thing', 'do', 'probably', 'ALL', 'are', 'likely', 'agree', 'BOWLING', 'FOR', 'COLUMBINE', 'Ask', 'ten', 'people', 'what', 'film', 'are', 'likely', 'get', 'ten', 'different', 'answers', 'Ask', 'same', 'ten', 'liked', 'not', 'will', 'probably', 'get', 'two', 'extremes', 'loved', 'hated', 'who', 'love', 'tend', 'champion', 'powerful', 'statement', 'favor', 'gun', 'control', 'who', 'hate', 'tend', 'consider', 'inaccurate', 'attack', 'gun', 'owners', 'general', 'NRA', 'particular.But', 'think', 'mistake', 'see', 'film', 'stance', 'true', 'Moore', 'lot', 'say', 'easy', 'access', 'irresponsible', 'handling', 'firearms', 'also', 'true', 'NRA', 'not', 'mention', 'then-president', 'Charleton', 'Heston', 'come', 'major', 'beating', 'hands', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'BOWLING', 'FOR', 'COLUMBINE', 'more', 'quot', 'quot', 'control', 'NRA', 'infamous', 'Columbine', 'High', 'School', 'incident', 'When', 'get', 'right', 'down', 'marrow', 'Moore', 'be', 'making', 'comment', 'how', 'politicians', 'corporations', 'work', 'take', 'advantage', 'paranoia', 'created', 'citizenry', 'mass', 'media', 'focused', 'what', 'sensational', 'rather', 'upon', 'what', 'actually', 'important.There', 'been', 'lot', 'complaint', 'Moore', 'fiddled', 'facts', 'suit', 'agenda', 'BOWLING', 'FOR', 'COLUMBINE', 'riddled', 'inaccuracies', 'Indeed', 'are', 'entire', 'websites', 'most', 'little', 'more', 'badly', 'researched', 'hysterical', 'rants', 'devoted', 'exposure', 'flaws', 'not', 'buy', 'even', 'most', 'Moore', 'data', 'seem', 'valid', 'overall', 'point', 'throw', 'out', 'basis', 'surface', 'errors', 'still', 'worse', 'bizarre', 'idea', 'documentaries', 'should', 'reside', 'rarefied', 'atmosphere', 'absolute', 'impartiality', 'even', 'greater', 'error', 'inaccuracy', 'bias', 'film', 'itself.Whether', 'actually', 'agree', 'film', 'not', 'BOWLING', 'FOR', 'COLUMBINE', 'truly', 'one', 'film', 'will', 'hold', 'attention', 'bitter', 'end', 'often', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'wildly', 'satirical', 'bitterly', 'ironic', 'opinionated', 'thought-provoking', 'extremely', 'disquieting', 'powerful', 'statement', 'do', 'have', 'one', 'complaint', 'significant', 'one', 'Moore', ""n't"", 'seem', 'communicate', 'consistent', 'idea', 're', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'it.How', 'do', 'dispense', 'media-fueled', 'paranoia', 'vulnerable', 'corporate', 'political', 'hucksters', 'Obviously', 'critical', 'rather', 'reactionary', 'thinking', ""n't"", 'really', 'something', 'Moore', 'specifically', 'course', 'film', 'Very', 'well', 'how', 'do', 'break', 'cycle', 'reactionary', 'rather', 'critical', 'thinking', 'question', 'Moore', 'answer', 'When', 'open', 'ended', 'quality', 'combines', 'film', 'often', 'brilliant', 'frequently', 'scattered', 'approach', 'well', 'just', 'might', 'leave', 'feeling', 'none', 'wiser', 'were', 'when', 'came', 'in.The', 'DVD', 'several', 'extras', 'very', 'interesting', 'most', 'particularly', 'quot', 'Return', 'Denver/Littleton', 'Featurette', 'quot', 'interview', 'Joe', 'Lockart', 'interview', 'Charlie', 'Rose', 'Final', 'thought', 'more', 'worth', 'seeing', 'one', 'way', 'reaction', 'likely', 'extreme.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",Bowling For Columbine VHS
739296,A3M5O6UHXO9IBU,B00008DDVU,Gary,"[32, 77]","Muddled and spurious. Most irritating moment is the flash card run through of America's alleged misdemeanours abroad which were supposed to be accepted on some subliminal level rather than thought about.If you pose the question as to why there is such a high level of gun crime in the States then it might be worth your while looking at the convictions and drawing some conclusion as to the motivations behind them. At one point we are shown a quick collage of video recorded shootings for the purpose of illustrating the point that Americans kill each other rather than examining why. It's curious that Moore should lambast American imperialism while showing indifference to a foreign audience who may not be familiar with the background story behind the clips. Doesn't he care that we might like to know or does he think it's irrelevant because he merely wanted to point out that guns discharge bullets? I do recognise the clips, which have been aired in the UK in various documentaries. One was the highway guy who I think was shot by a police marksman. Less familiar was the man trying to shoot a women as she lay screaming on some grass and it was distressing to have been subjected to this while being kept in the dark about why this was happening. The footage of a man in police custody being shot in the head I recall as occuring at a courthouse where the man was about to go on trial for raping the assailant's child. The motivation of this crime would appear to be revenge then, rather than the catch-all 'fear' that Moore seemed to be pushing without question. What else would examining gun crime convictions reveal, if he had bothered? How many gun murders occur during robberies, for instance? The motivation could be unwillingness to work for a living, rather than fear. Moore questionably states that the poverty issue is the preserve of the left but wouldn't it be worthwhile talking to the criminals who actually commit crimes rather than scoring political points? Of course, prisons are full of innocent men, but some are honest about discussing their failings. Knocking on Canadian doors is less illuminating and statistically meaningless, too.I'm also minded of how television stations in Britain often cancel films that may offend those who have been the recent victims of an air disaster or child abduction, only to show them two weeks later. Likewise with the Heston interview. Is it any more morally acceptable for Heston to cancel his visits to Flint and others mentioned only to arrive at a later date when the victim's families may be less bereaved? Moore ducks this question. Why should Moore expect Heston to be held to account for the death of the little girl when Moore himself is a NRA member? Just because he wouldn't have been crass enough to show up at the meeting?One of the reasons often put forward in favour of having a gun in every home in the States is to prevent a totalitarian government from oppressing the people after a coup. The film doesn't examine this interesting point. After all, it beggers the question as to how, if a totalitarian administration would be unable to impose it's will on an armed American people, can a democratically elected government enforce the legitimate laws of the land now? Certainly there seems to be this very problem already with some of the Militias portrayed in the film.

Moses has left the building ...and it turns out the that the avuncular chairman of the NRA is an inarticulate old coot without his teleprompter. It is moments like this that make ""Bowling For Columbine"" compelling viewing.Moore takes his agit-prop artistry straight from Saul Alinsky's ""Rules for Radicals"". Alinsky, the notorious grass roots organizer from the Back of the Yards neighborhood of Chicago, advises radicals to personalize their political targets and embarass them into submission. Moore may look like he just fell off a barstool in a Flint Michigan honky tonk, but he is a articulate street fighter in this exploration of the root cause of violence in America. Moore wisely chooses not to argue with the gun toting members of the Michigan militia. Instead, Moore uses the guise of a ""puff interview"" to allow militia members to reveal their lunacy in ungaurded moments.

But after 4-5 months of actually following U.S. politics and policies, I watched this DVD again and I was impressed.I'm not going to get into any arguments for or against gun control because that's not the (most) important issue in my opinion. The important issue which is shown in this movie (I suggest you read a book or two by Moore and Hegenomy or Survival by Noam Chomsky to really appreciate this documentary) is what is the cause of fear in Americans? Why do we always use minorities, non-Christians, the poor, etc. as the scapegoats for our problems? Why do we beat up on people who can't fight back - while at the same time give huge tax cuts to corporations and the rich.Of course Moore has a great way of showing emotion and I cried a couple of times while watching the movie.I won't get into the story, other reviewers can probably do that much better than me. One part which was very important was when Moore plays the song, ""It's a Wonderful World"" and talks about how time after time again the U.S. has overthrown democratically elected leaders and installed dictators or supported dictators financially and with weapons.  He even talks about the Taliban and Saddam!! And this movie was made before we invaded Iraq.One thing I really like about Moore is that he actually shows the story from the point of view of minorities. Instead of politicians or corporation owners who take pictures with minorities and make sure there is plenty of media to see, Moore actually cares about helping minorities instead of making dumb jokes about them like people do on TV or using them for photo ops.The welfare to work part of the movie is really good.

739301,A1NT3HJYYHYCA5,B00008DDVU,Govindan Nair,"[3, 7]","It is hard not to be partisan in reacting to this partisan movie. This is a movie in which the movie maker clearly has a mission and is not shy about admitting it --  to shock us into the acknowledging the frightful realities of gun ownership and lack of gun control, and disabuse us of fallacies which have been propagated by the gun lobby and their partisans. It may not be accurate to categorize Michael Moore's film as a documentary since he engineers much of the footage himself,  generating much theater to make some of his points. For example, he convinces two teenage victims of a shooting who still have bullet fragments in their bodies to return them to Wal-Mart where the original ammunition was purchased. So admitting this as a blatantly partisan work, why should we think it has value? I believe it is in its unrelenting refusal to accept pat answers to the reasons underlying gun violence in the United States. Moore very ably takes to task gun advocate Charlton Heston's claims of ethnic diversity as the root of the problem of gun related violence, by pointing to the ethnic diversity of Canada where gun related violence is all but unknown. He actually takes his camera to check the front doors of several homes in a Canadian town to verify assertions by its residents that their homes are never locked. This kind of cinema verite is potent. He similarly does away with explanations based on a violent history or violent entertainment in the United States, pointing to examples of similar phenomena in Germany and Japan where the gun-related deaths are a miniscule fraction of the United States.  This is not to say there are no factual errors or simplifications in the movie. But, whichever way you look at it, Moore makes it hard for anyone to not face up to the fact that the United States has little justifiable explanation for why its children face a multiple of the risk of gun-related violence compared to their peers elsewhere in the industrial world. It is a reminder of a troubling message and viewers should expect to feel some unease with this movie.",4,"Try to focus on the message, not the medium",1063843200,"09 18, 2003",2003,2080,"['hard', 'not', 'be', 'partisan', 'reacting', 'partisan', 'movie', 'movie', 'movie', 'maker', 'clearly', 'mission', 'not', 'shy', 'admitting', 'shock', 'acknowledging', 'frightful', 'realities', 'gun', 'ownership', 'lack', 'gun', 'control', 'disabuse', 'fallacies', 'have', 'been', 'propagated', 'gun', 'lobby', 'partisans', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'accurate', 'categorize', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'film', 'documentary', 'much', 'footage', 'generating', 'much', 'theater', 'make', 'points', 'example', 'two', 'teenage', 'victims', 'shooting', 'who', 'still', 'have', 'bullet', 'fragments', 'bodies', 'return', 'Wal-Mart', 'where', 'original', 'ammunition', 'was', 'purchased', 'So', 'admitting', 'blatantly', 'partisan', 'work', 'why', 'should', 'think', 'value', 'believe', 'unrelenting', 'refusal', 'accept', 'pat', 'answers', 'reasons', 'underlying', 'gun', 'violence', 'United', 'States', 'Moore', 'very', 'ably', 'task', 'gun', 'advocate', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'claims', 'ethnic', 'diversity', 'root', 'problem', 'gun', 'related', 'violence', 'pointing', 'ethnic', 'diversity', 'Canada', 'where', 'gun', 'related', 'violence', 'unknown', 'actually', 'camera', 'check', 'front', 'doors', 'several', 'homes', 'Canadian', 'town', 'verify', 'assertions', 'residents', 'homes', 'are', 'never', 'locked', 'kind', 'cinema', 'verite', 'potent', 'similarly', 'away', 'explanations', 'based', 'violent', 'history', 'violent', 'entertainment', 'United', 'States', 'pointing', 'examples', 'similar', 'phenomena', 'Germany', 'Japan', 'where', 'gun-related', 'deaths', 'are', 'miniscule', 'fraction', 'United', 'States', 'not', 'say', 'are', 'factual', 'errors', 'simplifications', 'movie', 'whichever', 'way', 'look', 'Moore', 'hard', 'anyone', 'not', 'face', 'up', 'fact', 'United', 'States', 'little', 'justifiable', 'explanation', 'why', 'children', 'face', 'multiple', 'risk', 'gun-related', 'violence', 'compared', 'peers', 'elsewhere', 'industrial', 'world', 'reminder', 'troubling', 'message', 'viewers', 'should', 'expect', 'feel', 'unease', 'movie']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

739306,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B00008DDVU,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[3, 7]","I recently tackled this movie again, and it's still good and worth watching, there were aspects of it that I disliked more this time around.The film isn't strictly about gun control.  While Moore does mention that they are tons of guns in this country, he also mentions that Canada has tons of guns as well (more per capita than the US), yet Canada doesn't have the amount of violence that we do here.  Moore also points out rather telling of our culture of fear, where the news media constantly tells us we're about to die tomorrow from everything to blue jeans to bottled water.  Everything is going to kill us.  He also has a great interview with Marilyn Manson, the rock star who was ""responsible"" for the Columbine killings, despite the fact he wasn't at the actual shooting and two teenagers actually shot all the students.  Moore hilariously points out that the US was bombing the bejeesus out of Yugoslavia during this time (a pre-emptive war on a country that did nothing to us, sound familiar?), and Clinton himself said ""we need to teach our young people to solve their problems with words, not weapons.  Now y'all excuse me, I have to authorise more missiles and kill more civilians"".  Clinton didn't actually say the 2nd line, but he might as well have, as that's exactly what he did.  In other words, Moore makes some good points, and the film is not really about the gun issue but is about the violence issue.Moore's tactics, on the other hand, are questionable.  He brings some survivors to the Kmart headquarters to ask for their money back for the armor that's embedded in their bodies.  It's an example of ambush journalism that Moore has to realise by now it isn't going to work. It's just done for show and nothing else.  All he ends up doing is embarrassing people at Kmart headquarters, the victims of the shooting for going along with the stunt, and himself.The worst tactic is his interview with Charlton Heston.  Heston, as we all know, was the head of the NRA for many years until he resigned when he admitted he had Alzheimer's.  When Moore interviews Heston, it's pretty damn obvious from Heston's speech and movements that he's having difficulty staying coherent and on point, and Heston seems confused by Moore's aggressive tactics.  Moore must have realised that Heston was suffering from early Alzheimer's, and instead of engaging the man in a civilised manner and taking into account that he really wasn't all there, Moore pressed on anyway and bullied the ailing actor.  Granted, I'm a Heston fan, but I think it would have made a much better (and more humane) interview had Moore given more background information on Heston and treated him as a man who was suffering from Alzheimer's.  Heston was actually a liberal during his hollywood heyday.  He marched with MLK (a few years before it became ""alright"" in the eyes of Hollywood and the country), and he supported both JFK and Adlai Stevenson.  Moore has selectively edited before (he did actually interview Roger Smith of GM for his film Roger and Me, but decided not to use it and pushed the lie that he didn't get an interview with him), and I feel that he probably did this to Heston to.While I feel this film is worth watching, I have more mixed feelings about it than I did before.",4,"Very good at times, but also aggravating and annoying....",1219968000,"08 29, 2008",2008,3275,"['recently', 'tackled', 'movie', 'again', 'still', 'good', 'worth', 'watching', 'were', 'aspects', 'disliked', 'more', 'time', 'around.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'strictly', 'gun', 'control', 'Moore', 'mention', 'are', 'tons', 'guns', 'country', 'also', 'Canada', 'tons', 'guns', 'well', 'more', 'capita', 'US', 'yet', 'Canada', ""n't"", 'have', 'amount', 'violence', 'do', 'here', 'Moore', 'also', 'out', 'rather', 'telling', 'culture', 'fear', 'where', 'news', 'media', 'constantly', ""'re"", 'die', 'tomorrow', 'everything', 'blue', 'jeans', 'bottled', 'water', 'Everything', 'going', 'kill', 'also', 'great', 'interview', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'rock', 'star', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'Columbine', 'killings', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'actual', 'shooting', 'two', 'teenagers', 'actually', 'shot', 'students', 'Moore', 'hilariously', 'out', 'US', 'was', 'bombing', 'bejeesus', 'Yugoslavia', 'time', 'pre-emptive', 'war', 'country', 'did', 'nothing', 'sound', 'familiar', 'Clinton', 'said', 'need', 'teach', 'young', 'people', 'solve', 'problems', 'words', 'not', 'weapons', 'Now', ""y'all"", 'excuse', 'have', 'authorise', 'more', 'missiles', 'kill', 'more', 'civilians', 'Clinton', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'say', '2nd', 'line', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'exactly', 'what', 'did', 'other', 'words', 'Moore', 'good', 'points', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'gun', 'issue', 'violence', 'issue.Moore', 'tactics', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'questionable', 'survivors', 'Kmart', 'headquarters', 'ask', 'money', 'back', 'armor', 'embedded', 'bodies', 'example', 'ambush', 'journalism', 'Moore', 'realise', 'now', ""n't"", 'going', 'work', 'just', 'done', 'show', 'nothing', 'else', 'up', 'doing', 'embarrassing', 'people', 'Kmart', 'headquarters', 'victims', 'shooting', 'going', 'along', 'stunt', 'himself.The', 'worst', 'tactic', 'interview', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Heston', 'know', 'was', 'head', 'NRA', 'many', 'years', 'resigned', 'when', 'admitted', 'had', 'Alzheimer', 'When', 'Moore', 'Heston', 'pretty', 'damn', 'obvious', 'Heston', 'speech', 'movements', 'having', 'difficulty', 'staying', 'coherent', 'point', 'Heston', 'confused', 'Moore', 'aggressive', 'tactics', 'Moore', 'must', 'have', 'realised', 'Heston', 'was', 'suffering', 'early', 'Alzheimer', 'instead', 'engaging', 'man', 'civilised', 'manner', 'taking', 'account', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'all', 'there', 'Moore', 'pressed', 'anyway', 'bullied', 'ailing', 'actor', 'Granted', ""'m"", 'Heston', 'fan', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'humane', 'interview', 'had', 'Moore', 'given', 'more', 'background', 'information', 'Heston', 'treated', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'suffering', 'Alzheimer', 'Heston', 'was', 'actually', 'liberal', 'hollywood', 'heyday', 'marched', 'MLK', 'few', 'years', 'became', 'alright', 'eyes', 'Hollywood', 'country', 'supported', 'JFK', 'Adlai', 'Stevenson', 'Moore', 'selectively', 'edited', 'did', 'actually', 'interview', 'Roger', 'Smith', 'GM', 'film', 'Roger', 'Me', 'decided', 'not', 'use', 'pushed', 'lie', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'interview', 'feel', 'probably', 'did', 'Heston', 'to.While', 'feel', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'have', 'more', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'did', 'before']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

As a native Briton, I was even more interested in the film b/c of the comparison's to Canada this film makes which - in terms of gun control - is very similar to Britain.When I walked out my mind was racing.  So many issues to discuss, where does one start?  Let me just focus on who should see this.  If you're the type that's anti-guns, you've just got to watch this film, after-all, it's made for you.  If you own an army-surplus store, you may want to avoid it.Moore has a knack for making people with a lot of power he wishes to target look completely stupid on camera, it's funny to watch frankly, but the point to take is that these folks he goes after truly do not know the magnitude of influence they have over many in this country.  The best conversations happen with one of the creators of South Park and Marilyn Manson - click over to the website for this film to view the interviews - where they disect how  they are individuals who are the target of much criticism when really they are as much against violence as anyone else.This film focuses a lot of fear that's instilled in us in from the media.  Why is it we only hear bad news every time we turn on the tv?  Why can't we have the opposite?  He doesn't necessarily give answers to questions he puts forth but he does bring some interseting facts to the table to make you wonder why.  Columbine also touches on race issues and how the media reports more ""black"" crime than ""white"".  Interesting interviews with the producer of ""Cops"" touch on why that shows always seem to find a black guy with no shirt on getting in trouble.And how about the Kmart incident?  This is a truly powerful piece of documentary making considering Moore achieves much more than he ever could from talking to a company.  I won't spoil this, just watch it!Overall, a great film.

S. than practically anywhere else on earth, he responds at first by saying we have always been a nation of blood, a nation of violence. He then opines that it's because we are a nation of &quot;diverse ethnicity.&quot; He had previously said in the interview that he keeps a loaded gun in his gated estate because of the Second Amendment and if it was good enough for the &quot;white&quot; men who founded this country, it's good enough for him. I believe that qualifies as undiluted racism. Moore interviews Heston and several others, some for and others against the easy access in this country to guns and ammunition. What I found amazing about this movie is that so many people spoke so openly when they knew they were being filmed. On the other hand, that's no more amazing than what ordinary Americans reveal about themselves on late night TV shows.Moore asks  other hard questions--for example, about the welfare-to-work program that forces a single mother to travel 80 miles one way each day to work two minimum wage jobs that don't provide her with enough income to pay her rent. This is the same mom whose six-year-old son finds his uncle's gun, takes the gun to school in Flint, Michigan and shoots another six-year-old. Moore also takes on corporate greed, the news media's obsession with violent crimes as well as the zigzag approach the United States government has taken to various dictators over the years.I do not know if seeing this movie will make people change their minds about guns and killing in this country or not.

Moore seems to ask in his film, edited like a documentary as well as an investigation. The fault of the whole political class, which organizes illegal destitutions all over the (third) world, finances and gives weapons to dictators and terrorists, sends bombs and missiles everywhere? Of the medias, which permanently keeps on an atmosphere of fear, suspicion and hate through violent and bloody pictures broadcasted daily, in the TV news, with an obvious commercial purpose? Of the poverty which hits mainly the Black people, who - as well as some hard rockers with weird figures and shapes, like Marilyn Manson - are put on an evil level in order to be used as guilty ones every time something wrong happens?From the supermarket of guns to the bank which gives a rifle as a gift when an account is opened, through an exhilarating cartoon in the ""South Park"" style, resuming in a few minutes the history of America, based upon fear, ignorance of the other in front and blood, the interviews of some teenagers at school, of some gun lovers (including Jerry Nichols, the brother of Terry, one of the two people who destroyed a building in Oklahoma City in 1995, killing 168 people), who consider the carrying of guns as a duty and a responsibility, and of a disgusting Charlton Heston - he's the president of the NRA (National Rifle Association) which still keeps encouraging the free market of fire guns all over the country -, Michael Moore, within only two hours, manages to tell with strength and an undeniable humor about all the more serious problems in the so-called land of free and the result is an astounding shocker, a great demonstration of the American paranoia, the admittance of powerlessness of a whole manipulated country.

He speaks of the High School shooting in Littleton. He is always surprising. We expected an approach that would try to recapture the two young men who went berserk, their backgrounds, their surroundings, their friends and families. In one word try to explain why these two perfectly normal young men could have run into such a pile of guano. But no. Michael Moore attacks somewhere else. He attacks the National Rifle Association all along, and yet he comes to the idea that it does not explain anything because in Canada they probable have even more guns per head. And they do not have a number of killings with fire-arms that could come close to comparing with the US. That's just the point here. The whole film is built on a line that in the end he has to push aside. And he comes up with another completely different and hardly supported in the film: Americans have a problem with their psyche. He does not specify if it is their individual psyches or if it is their collective psyche. And I must say it is kind of disappointing. He brutally interrupts the President of the NRA, Charlton Heston who is speaking of the wide presence of violence in American history (and the ethnicity of that violence) by quoting Germany, Russia, England and Japan as violent countries. But that does not in anyway bring him towards his conclusion. In other words he concludes with an opinion that is not supported by what he has shown in the film.

739320,A1A535W556ROBQ,B00008DDVU,James Ferguson,"[8, 13]","Michael Moore is very effective at mixing polemics with facts, but in the process he often contradicts himself.  While this movie is ostensibly about the Columbine shootings, it evolves into an attack against the weapons manufacturing industry, K-Mart and the National Rifle Association, as those most responsible for the widespread proliferation of firearms and ammunition in America.  But, as Moore points out, Canada has easy access to many of the same weapons, yet does not have such a violent culture, noting that less than 200 persons are killed by firearms each year, as opposed to 11,000 in America.  So, it would seem the old adage, &quot;guns don't kill people, people kill people,&quot; would aptly apply to this movie.The violent nature of Americans is one that has befuddled sociologists and psychologists for decades.  As Moore points out, American history is no more violent than is German, French or British history, yet these countries have a much lower murder rate than the US.  Moore gets nearer his target when he illustrates that the &quot;fear factor&quot; seems to be the underlying factor, with commercial and political interests using it to get Americans to buy into the gun and security industry that has become such a pervasive part of our society.  He contrasts this with Canada, where even in Windsor, across the river from Detroit, many Canadians don't lock their doors at night.  For whatever reason, Americans seem to have had it inculcated into their heads that someone is out there to get them and that they better have a deadbolt lock and a gun on their bedside table.Eventually, he circled back to the shootings at Columbine, even showing the eerie sequence of events on school cameras. The kids who shot up the school were classic loners, who used guns to vent their frustration on the school, weeks before graduation.  What galled Moore and most parents of the school kids at Columbine was that Charleton Heston pitched up in Denver within a week to promote the NRA.  He did the same in Flint following the tragic shooting of a 6-year girl by a 6 year-old boy. While Moore never gets behind the reasons, he does corner Heston for an interview at film's end.But, it is his assault on K-Mart that yields the best rewards.  He showed up at the national center with two of the boys who survived the shootings and demanded that K-Mart stop its sale of 9 mm bullets, which were used in the Columbine shootings.  Much to his surprise and that of the media that had gathered to film the standoff, K-Mart agreed not only to stop selling 9 mm bullets but to phase out the sale of all ammunition in 90 days.  Moore showed once again that you can stand up to the big boys and fight for what is right and win.Unfortunately, his polemical stance often clouds this work as he vents his frustration with Clinton and Bush for not dealing with the issue of gun control like he thinks they should.  He used Kosovo to highlight the indifference Moore perceived, by noting that a major bombing campaign occured the same day as the Columbine shootings.",4,Fascinating but flawed view of America's gun culture.,1089504000,"07 11, 2004",2004,3068,"['Michael', 'Moore', 'very', 'effective', 'mixing', 'polemics', 'facts', 'process', 'often', 'movie', 'ostensibly', 'Columbine', 'shootings', 'attack', 'weapons', 'manufacturing', 'industry', 'K-Mart', 'National', 'Rifle', 'Association', 'most', 'responsible', 'widespread', 'proliferation', 'firearms', 'ammunition', 'America', 'Moore', 'points', 'out', 'Canada', 'easy', 'access', 'many', 'same', 'weapons', 'yet', 'not', 'have', 'such', 'violent', 'culture', 'noting', 'less', '200', 'persons', 'are', 'killed', 'firearms', 'year', 'opposed', '11,000', 'America', 'So', 'would', 'seem', 'old', 'adage', 'quot', 'guns', 'do', ""n't"", 'kill', 'people', 'people', 'kill', 'people', 'quot', 'would', 'aptly', 'apply', 'movie.The', 'violent', 'nature', 'Americans', 'one', 'befuddled', 'sociologists', 'psychologists', 'decades', 'Moore', 'points', 'out', 'American', 'history', 'more', 'violent', 'German', 'French', 'British', 'history', 'yet', 'countries', 'have', 'much', 'lower', 'murder', 'rate', 'US', 'Moore', 'nearer', 'target', 'when', 'quot', 'fear', 'factor', 'quot', 'be', 'underlying', 'factor', 'commercial', 'political', 'interests', 'using', 'get', 'Americans', 'buy', 'gun', 'security', 'industry', 'become', 'pervasive', 'part', 'society', 'Canada', 'where', 'even', 'Windsor', 'river', 'Detroit', 'many', 'Canadians', 'do', ""n't"", 'lock', 'doors', 'night', 'reason', 'Americans', 'seem', 'have', 'had', 'inculcated', 'heads', 'someone', 'out', 'there', 'get', 'better', 'have', 'deadbolt', 'lock', 'gun', 'bedside', 'table.Eventually', 'circled', 'back', 'shootings', 'Columbine', 'even', 'showing', 'eerie', 'sequence', 'events', 'school', 'cameras', 'kids', 'who', 'shot', 'up', 'school', 'were', 'classic', 'loners', 'who', 'used', 'guns', 'vent', 'frustration', 'school', 'weeks', 'graduation', 'What', 'galled', 'Moore', 'most', 'parents', 'school', 'kids', 'Columbine', 'was', 'Charleton', 'Heston', 'pitched', 'up', 'Denver', 'week', 'promote', 'NRA', 'did', 'same', 'Flint', 'following', 'tragic', 'shooting', '6-year', 'girl', '6', 'year-old', 'boy', 'Moore', 'never', 'reasons', 'corner', 'Heston', 'interview', 'film', 'end.But', 'assault', 'K-Mart', 'best', 'rewards', 'showed', 'up', 'national', 'center', 'two', 'boys', 'who', 'survived', 'shootings', 'demanded', 'K-Mart', 'stop', 'sale', '9', 'mm', 'bullets', 'were', 'used', 'Columbine', 'shootings', 'Much', 'surprise', 'media', 'had', 'gathered', 'film', 'standoff', 'K-Mart', 'agreed', 'not', 'only', 'stop', 'selling', '9', 'mm', 'bullets', 'phase', 'out', 'sale', 'ammunition', '90', 'days', 'Moore', 'showed', 'once', 'again', 'can', 'stand', 'up', 'big', 'boys', 'fight', 'what', 'right', 'win.Unfortunately', 'polemical', 'stance', 'often', 'work', 'frustration', 'Clinton', 'Bush', 'not', 'dealing', 'issue', 'gun', 'control', 'should', 'used', 'Kosovo', 'highlight', 'indifference', 'Moore', 'perceived', 'noting', 'major', 'bombing', 'campaign', 'occured', 'same', 'day', 'Columbine', 'shootings']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

739325,A2LWDNKQZOR2A7,B00008DDVU,jason gilmour,"[15, 23]","Well, where to start tearing into this load of garbage is the tough part. As many of my fellow reviewers pointed out, this film has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH REALITY. Mike plays with facts, mocks innocent working class people and basically produces a warped view of the history of American gun laws and the nature of random violence. Mike's not-so-subtle manipulation of images should be obvious to even the most casual film fan.Moore never interviews criminologists, psychologists, or social workers on the topic of violence. Instead Moore turns to the air-headed Marilyn Manson for insight on the horror at Columbine. To interview experts would only get in the way of Mike's thesis which is : That anyone in America who disagrees with Michael Moore and his fans on gun control is a dumb, racist, violent hillbilly!  Moore focuses on the weirdest and most confused segment of pro-gun working class America and gleefuly exploits thier less than sophisticated language skills.  This approach comforts Moore's mostly educated and urban audience who will never even venture away from the cafe long enought to ever meet any of these ""primitive gun-lovin' hillbillys"". Gee, and I thought Moore was a workin' man's best friend.Moore also not-so-cleverly attempts to convince his upscale fans that Canada is a wonderful fantasy land where violence is rare and people never lock thier doors. Canadians are portrayed as dull simpletons who don't have an aggressive bone in thier bodies. PLEASE! Just last month there was a major killfest in Toronto where 4 people were killed in separate shootings. These people were all killed with, yep, you guessed it, UNREGISTERED GUNS. Mr. Moore, I live in east end Toronto and I triple lock my doors.One part that almost made me leave the theatre was the moronic cartoon about the "" history "" of violence in the U.S.. Talk about the oversimplification of complex social and political concepts! The Klan and NRA couldn't be farther apart politicaly! To blame ALL gun related violence ( even Black on Black violence) on some half-baked  racial theory is simply insane. Moore suggests that  violence, by some unexplained psychological process, is caused by white peoples envy and fear of African Americans. This cartoon segment did the most damage to Michael's already confused and juvenile argument.What is even more shocking is that fans of this film don't for one second question the facts or Moore's motives. The cult of Moore is as fanatic and narrow minded as the militants and gun lovers that they hate so much. Moore works on and exploits the pliable minds of his  hysterical and paranoid audience and takes them on a journey through his psychotic and self-centred world view. Instead of producing a subtle and convincing documentary, Moore uses the language and entertaining style of the mass media that he claims to hate so much. This film is just a MTV, CNN, NBC or CBS style paranoia-fest that offers simple social commentary mixed with sensational footage.

I loved watching Moore completely undress Heston during the final interview, not only was it a triumphant moment in cinema but a slap in the face to all of the rednecked, gun-toting maniacs in this country. Bowling for Columbine is the shot in the arm that this country needed to start a sensible plan for gun control. The statistics Moore cites are staggering and eye-opening. Aside from bitter disdain for the NRA, Moore (a lifetime member), takes a look at the gun issue from almost every perspective. The most powerful being the victims of the Columbine shooting. Moore also interviews such celebs as Matt Stone, Dick Clark (what a cold-hearted man) and Marilyn Manson. The path to Heston becomes all the more logical as the film progresses and the ultimate payoff is more than satisfying. Also, the insensitivity of the NRA is incredible. Just a few days after the Columbine massacre the NRA had the gall to stage a pro-gun rally in Littleton. This was no mistake...these people are sick and our Government needs to stand up and take notice.

739333,A140XH16IKR4B0,B00008DDVU,Jean E. Pouliot,"[3, 9]","You can never fault Michael Moore for keeping his opinions, however imperfect, to himself. In ""Bowling for Columbine,"" he strives mightily to understand the American penchant for guns and violence. That he doesn't succeed terribly well doesn't mean the effort wasn't worth the time or that the questions aren't worth pondering.Taking his starting point as the deadly shooting spree at Colorado's Columbine high school, Moore takes his best shot at understanding why more Americans are killed each year by gun violence (by far!!) than any other western nation. Moore raises a number of considerations that could account for the lethality of our culture. We are a frontier nation; we have easy access to firearms; we are a culture of hunters; we accept pockets of violence-inducing poverty and despair; we are involved in the manufacturer and export of weapons of hideous destructive power; we are a nation of racial differences. Yet in each case, Moore demonstrates that other western nations share these traits without increasing their gun-related death rates.The movie is by turns chilling and side-splitting. Watching the casual violence of the Columbine killers (and the real-life fear it evoked) will tighten your stomach like nothing else can. The history of the US as told by the creators of ""South Park"" is hilarious and true in equal measure. Moore's conversations with a victim of Columbine are heart-breaking. An interview with Oklahoma bombing suspect Terry McNichols is both.As well-crafted and heartfelt as it is, though, ""Bowling for Columbine"" doesn't successfully answer the question of why gun violence is so prevalent in America. But by eliminating some of the stock culprits (rock and roll music, violent video games, etc., etc.) Moore makes reaching for easy answers much more difficult.

739335,A2Z7TU96G2WB9B,B00008DDVU,"Jeffrey Leeper ""kem2070""","[1, 3]","Michael Moore makes people feel uncomfortable.  In his interviews with different people, the camera lingers, waiting for an additional comment or reaction.  Sometimes, he will follow up with another question to get the speaker to explain what he or she means in more detail.  Nevertheless, you want to laugh at the person being interviewed, but you can't help feeling a little uncomfortable yourself.Although the focus appears to be gun control, his argument doesn't seem to be focused there.  He looks at other cultures and their gun-death rates, then follows this with looking at how these are different than ours.  His answers highlight that this is not an easy question to answer.  For some reason, we are more violent than similar cultures.Like most Moore documentaries, the editing can seem a little disjointed.  It gives a slight comic twist to the film, but it also makes you question what got cut out.  Is he taking people out of context?Even if you don't like Michael Moore or his documentaries, you have to admit that they create discourse.  Further, these are issues that we should be talking about more.  For instance, he mentions that the mother of the six-year-old boy who shot a school-mate was on the welfare-to-work program, which prevented her from being at home.  The link from this program to the child having a gun was tenuous at best.  It is an issue that we should be discussing, but it's place here seemed forced.Also, Lockheed keeps popping up in the film.  Although the link is not direct or the primary focus, the repeated reference leads the viewer to think that this corporation may take a big share of the blame.  I don't think that it is true, but it is an interesting connection.  I had no idea of Lockheed's connection to the welfare system, though I will probably look into this on my own to affirm for myself.There are two disks in this special edition.  Unless you are a Michael Moore fan, these probably wouldn't interest you (like the interviews with the director).  However, it would be great if teacher's looked at the Teacher's Guide.

739336,A1PNNR3B9H8GTC,B00008DDVU,Jeremy Berman,"[6, 9]","Produced, written and directed by the inimitable Michael Moore, Bowling For Columbine examines how domestic fears have increased America's obsession with guns and scrutinizes the tragedies that have befallen countless individuals in this country as the result of that obsession. Moore's bravado and showmanship always brings high entertainment value to all of his documentaries, and it is always a pleasure to see him exposing the spinelessness or hypocrisy of some political pawn or coporate underling. It is unfortunate to reflect that despite the noble intentions of the filmmaker, Bowling for Columbine rarely offers definitive answers to the social issues it discusses and often recklessly and foolishly correlates American violence with everything from our nation's foreign policy to killer bees. Nevertheless, the film is undeniably provocative, and never fails to directly confront the forces it opposes. Among the highlights of the movie: a hard hitting interview with NRA president Charlton Heston (in which the Oscar winning actor appears too befuddled and insensitive to effectively discuss the ideals of his organization), an interview with the producer of the television show COPS (who shows no compunction for fostering fear and loathing of minorities because ""violence sells,"") and an encounter with Oklahoma City bombing suspect James Nichols (who encourages people to own guns, but believes that the personal ownership of nuclear weapons should be illegal because ""there are some real sickos out there"").

This film is nothing but clever editing with a whole lot of social scapegoating.  It's laughable seeing Michael try to pin the blame possibly on the  Lockhill-Selma plant in town.  As for the reviewer who said that the spokesman was standing right in front of a nuclear warhead, you should check your facts.  It was revealed that the plant in question in town was building rockets to launch T.V. Satellites into space.  Don't take my word for it, check up on the facts.  Moore's butchering of history is itself hysterical in the short animated segment where he tries to portray the country of England that the Puritans fled from as being benevolent and even worse where he portrays the Ku Klux Klan and NRA being the same organization, simply because both come up after the civil war.  Anyone who checks up on history knows that the NRA was founded by former Union officials to improve marksmanship.  Just go read the books Negroes With Guns and Radio-Free Dixie.  If one doesn't know their facts or history, than that's forgiveable, but the fact that this film won so many awards is not forgiveable when you take into account the manipulative editing.  He asks a Michigan Militiaman about why not using non-violent resistance, only to have the guy reply, ""I've never heard about that before"".  Yet you don't actually see Michael Moore on screen at all, so for all you know he could have asked a different question and then insterted himself in the editing room asking the question about non-violent resistance.  The opening scene with him at the bank is so obviously screwy as he asks the worker if it's a little dangerous handing a gun out at a bank, yet cuts it before the worker has a chance to answer.  The splicing together of different segments of different speeches from Charlton Heston using protest footage to hide the switch is also quite useful to sway the gullible non-critical viewer.  Notice how Charlton Heston's tie-color changes at one point even.  Also the point near the end where he shows up the photo of the little girl who was killed.  Moore insisted that he used two cameras (hence the switch in perspectives) yet when the perspective changes you don't see the other cameraman who should be there.  There should be one to the left of Moore and in front of him.  Yet you don't ever see them, which is impossible unless Moore lied and basically used just one cameraman to film two different segments (one before and one after Charlton Heston left) along with two different vocal tracks (one of the reasons for shooting behind Michael Moore is so that you don't see Moore's face and mouth from behind).  Those points are just the tip of the iceberg.  When it comes to statistics, Moore never tells where he got them or mentions the difference in populations between the U.S. and other countries.  Add to that just many editing tricks that are so obvious to anyone that thinks for themself and doesn't just buy into Moore like some dittohead.",1,So blatantly manipulatively edited,1106092800,"01 19, 2005",2005,3057,"['saw', 'movie', 'order', 'understand', 'what', 'buzz', 'was', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'disgusted', 'film', 'nothing', 'clever', 'editing', 'whole', 'lot', 'social', 'scapegoating', 'laughable', 'seeing', 'Michael', 'try', 'pin', 'blame', 'possibly', 'Lockhill-Selma', 'plant', 'town', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'spokesman', 'was', 'standing', 'right', 'front', 'nuclear', 'warhead', 'should', 'check', 'facts', 'was', 'revealed', 'plant', 'question', 'town', 'was', 'building', 'rockets', 'launch', 'T.V', 'Satellites', 'space', 'Do', ""n't"", 'take', 'word', 'check', 'up', 'facts', 'Moore', 'butchering', 'history', 'hysterical', 'short', 'animated', 'segment', 'where', 'portray', 'country', 'England', 'Puritans', 'fled', 'being', 'benevolent', 'even', 'worse', 'where', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'NRA', 'being', 'same', 'organization', 'simply', 'come', 'up', 'civil', 'war', 'Anyone', 'who', 'up', 'history', 'knows', 'NRA', 'was', 'founded', 'former', 'Union', 'officials', 'improve', 'marksmanship', 'Just', 'go', 'read', 'books', 'Negroes', 'Guns', 'Radio-Free', 'Dixie', 'one', ""n't"", 'know', 'facts', 'history', 'forgiveable', 'fact', 'film', 'won', 'so', 'many', 'awards', 'not', 'forgiveable', 'when', 'take', 'account', 'manipulative', 'editing', 'Michigan', 'Militiaman', 'why', 'not', 'using', 'non-violent', 'resistance', 'only', 'have', 'guy', 'reply', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'see', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'screen', 'know', 'could', 'have', 'asked', 'different', 'question', 'then', 'insterted', 'editing', 'room', 'asking', 'question', 'non-violent', 'resistance', 'opening', 'scene', 'bank', 'so', 'obviously', 'screwy', 'worker', 'little', 'dangerous', 'handing', 'gun', 'out', 'bank', 'yet', 'worker', 'chance', 'answer', 'splicing', 'together', 'different', 'segments', 'different', 'speeches', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'using', 'protest', 'footage', 'hide', 'switch', 'also', 'quite', 'useful', 'sway', 'gullible', 'non-critical', 'viewer', 'Notice', 'how', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'tie-color', 'changes', 'one', 'point', 'even', 'Also', 'point', 'end', 'where', 'up', 'photo', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'Moore', 'insisted', 'used', 'two', 'cameras', 'hence', 'switch', 'perspectives', 'yet', 'when', 'perspective', 'changes', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'other', 'cameraman', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'there', 'should', 'be', 'one', 'left', 'Moore', 'front', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'see', 'impossible', 'Moore', 'lied', 'basically', 'used', 'just', 'one', 'cameraman', 'film', 'two', 'different', 'segments', 'one', 'one', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'left', 'two', 'different', 'vocal', 'tracks', 'one', 'reasons', 'shooting', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Moore', 'face', 'mouth', 'points', 'are', 'just', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'When', 'statistics', 'Moore', 'never', 'where', 'got', 'mentions', 'difference', 'populations', 'U.S.', 'other', 'countries', 'Add', 'just', 'many', 'editing', 'tricks', 'are', 'so', 'obvious', 'anyone', 'themself', ""n't"", 'just', 'buy', 'Moore', 'dittohead']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

(Okay, so it was technically his acceptance speech at the Academy Awards that made him famous as opposed to the film itself).  Nonetheless, the film has created quite a following -- and quite a controversy. Either way, it has been successful in getting America to talk and think.  Many people dismiss the film as being too ""sided,"" but then again, virtually every political document in the history of the U.S. has been ""sided"" in one way or another.  And whether you agree with the film or not, it should still be viewed because of it's significance to modern-day politics and pop-culture.  The film basically documents America's obsession with guns, and prooves that this obsession is nothing new.  Using extensive footage from the Columbine masacre as well as editing in snippets of NRA rallies and other school shootings, Moore's documentary provides no answers, but doesn't have to.  It is what it is:  a very well-put-together film that gets Moore's point across on multiple levels.  At times the film feels more like propoganda than anything else, so take everything Moore says and shows with a grain of salt.  And more importantly, think about what he DOESN'T show as often as you think about what he DOES show (the key to all documentary analysis).The sake of this review is not for me to agree or disagree with anything Moore says with the film.  Being completely unbiased, the documentary is done very well on a technical and emotional level.  Perhaps the most interesting aspect (that will surprise many viewers) is that the most intelligent things said in the entire film are by shock-rocker Marilyn Manson when Moore interviews him regarding Columbine.",4,"Whether you like it or you hate it, you should still see it.",1101254400,"11 24, 2004",2004,1751,"['Bowling', 'Columbine', 'was', 'documentary', 'made', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'household', 'name', 'Okay', 'was', 'technically', 'acceptance', 'speech', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'made', 'famous', 'opposed', 'film', 'Nonetheless', 'film', 'created', 'quite', 'following', 'quite', 'controversy', 'way', 'been', 'successful', 'getting', 'America', 'talk', 'think', 'Many', 'people', 'dismiss', 'film', 'being', 'too', 'sided', 'then', 'again', 'virtually', 'political', 'document', 'history', 'U.S.', 'been', 'sided', 'one', 'way', 'agree', 'film', 'not', 'should', 'still', 'be', 'viewed', 'significance', 'modern-day', 'politics', 'pop-culture', 'film', 'basically', 'documents', 'America', 'obsession', 'guns', 'obsession', 'nothing', 'new', 'Using', 'extensive', 'footage', 'Columbine', 'masacre', 'as', 'well', 'editing', 'snippets', 'NRA', 'rallies', 'other', 'school', 'shootings', 'Moore', 'documentary', 'answers', ""n't"", 'have', 'what', 'very', 'well-put-together', 'film', 'Moore', 'point', 'multiple', 'levels', 'times', 'film', 'more', 'propoganda', 'anything', 'else', 'so', 'take', 'everything', 'Moore', 'grain', 'salt', 'more', 'importantly', 'think', 'what', ""N'T"", 'show', 'as', 'often', 'think', 'what', 'show', 'key', 'documentary', 'analysis', '.The', 'sake', 'review', 'not', 'agree', 'disagree', 'anything', 'Moore', 'film', 'Being', 'completely', 'unbiased', 'documentary', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'technical', 'emotional', 'level', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'will', 'surprise', 'many', 'viewers', 'most', 'intelligent', 'things', 'said', 'entire', 'film', 'are', 'shock-rocker', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'when', 'Moore', 'regarding', 'Columbine']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

Houzet ""wozamoya""","[17, 38]","I am not a gun owner, neither do I have strong personal feelings about the right to bear arms, but I know leftwing propaganda when I see it. That's the problem with so much of what liberals stand for today - they take such extreme positions in such a loud-mouthed way, they alienate most regular people. The war in Iraq is one huge example. Ordinary, patriotic Americans got so sick and tired of seeing the Martin Sheens and Susan Sarandons parading around and declaring their hatred for the Bush Administration, and the Dixie Chicks and Bruce Springsteens abusing their platform at music concerts to denounce President Bush when all that people wanted was for them to shut up and sing.Michael Moore is another liberal idiot who has alienated much of mainstream America. Even many of his fellow liberal celebs were embarrassed at his little tirade at the Oscars, wanting him to shut up and hurry off the stage. Moore has a knack for distorting the truth, demeaning people and taking advantage of tragedy for his own despicable political agenda. Columbine is one example. There were parents of Columbine shooting victims who didn't want to speak to Moore, knowing his twisted motives. As the father of Rachel Scott said, ""Guns didn't kill my daughter, people killed my daughter."" With their motives, those two sick boys could have used any means to murder, maim and terrify.A documentary would have been better spent analyzing the motives of children who want to kill their classmates. The easy access the Columbine killers had to firearms is scary for sure, and their parents should be held accountable. But to suggest guns are inherently evil and that ""gun control"" is the solution to America's bloodlust is missing the point. People were killing each other before guns were invented. There already are laws to control gun ownership. If the courts would do their job and honor the work the police do, we would be locking up many more illegal arms dealers, gangsters and drug dealers, thus making the average citizen feel safer and less inclined to buy a firearm for protection.For the liberal sanctimony and falsehood presented in this ""documentary,"" I loathe Michael Moore more than ever.

What does bother me is his distorting, telling half-truths, his manipulating audio and video to make things appear truthful, and other times just flat-out lying to make others believe what he's presenting as fact.In the ""film"", Moore attempts to portray the NRA (yes, I'm a proud, dues paying member) as cold and heartless for coming to Denver after the Columbine shootings for, as he puts it, a ""large pro-gun rally"". This is misleading. In fact, all rallies, dinners, sporting events, etc. were canceled out of respect for victims' families. The only thing that took place was an annual members' meeting which was required to be held under corporate law.  At the same meeting, Moore takes the snipets of a Charlton Heston speech and puts them in the order that he wants. Heston is reading a letter from the mayor of Denver asking that the meeting be cancelled. Heston is shown to reply, ""Don't come here?  We're already here."" Again, this is meant to make the NRA look defiant, cold, and heartless. However, Moore leaves out the part where Heston is saying that there are already scores of NRA members living in the Denver area. ""We're already here"", refers to them.  But playing the speech the way it was originally delivered doesn't make Heston look like a cold-blooded monster, so Moore had to make changes.The next lie centers on the young girl that was shot near Flint, MI. Again, Moore states ""Just as he did after the Columbine shooting, Charlton Heston showed up in Flint, to have a big pro-gun rally."" Never one to leave out unimportant facts, Moore fails to mention Heston was in Flint eight months after the shooting for a ""get out the vote"" rally. Vice-President Gore was also in the area at that time for the same purpose but Moore apparently found that acceptable.The cartoon comparing NRA members to KKK members is also pure nonsense. The NRA was founded in 1871 (five years after the KKK)by Union officers who were supportive of the rights of black citizens. In fact, eight of the first ten NRA presidents were former Union veterans including President U.S. Grant.  Teddy Roosevelt was also a life member.Finally, the interview with Heston in his home by Moore was particularly underhanded, in my opinion. Moore presents himself as an NRA life member, which helps him gain entrance into Heston's home. Perhaps Heston made a disagreeable comment or two, but Moore still takes advantage of a man in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Moore takes advantage of the fact that Heston has a foggy memory of the events by continuing to act as if Heston came to Flint soon after the six-year-old girl was shot. Just like his final act of placing the picture of the girl at Heston's door, the entire visit was a play for the cameras. Moore apparently has no shame.No one was a bigger fan of Roger and Me when it was released and I enjoyed ""TV Nation"" when it played on NBC in the mid-90's. Moore showed that he genuinely knew about the topics in Roger and Me which concerned the loss of good manufacturing jobs and corporate greed. He should return to that theme if he has to lie to play the role of gun grabber.  Like I said before, Moore is entitled to his opinion about firearms or anything else. It doesn't bother me that he doesn't like guns. His attempts to influence others through lies and deception does.",1,He lied to further his own agenda.

However, I legitimately just saw this movie last week for the first time.I was very disappointed to say the least.  I was amazed at Moore's ability to manipulate situations to suit himself.  Most of the time he came off as a crazy loon asking very stupid questions.  I understand that it was supposed to be sarcasm, but sarcasm is not the first thing I think of when it comes to teens shooting up their school.One of his biggest mistakes in my opinion was blaming Dick Clark for a little girl's death.  Not only did he blame Dick Clark personally, but he also tracked the man down to try to get an interview.  It was painful and embarrassing to watch Moore carry on and yell at Dick Clark on the side of the road.Moore is also one heck of a terrible actor.  Chasing Charlton Heston around Heston's home trying to get him to look at the picture of the slain girl was ghastly.  Moore then licked his acting chops, and begged Heston to look at the picture.  I was appalled.  I know I was supposed to be appalled that Heston refused to do it, but instead I was appalled at Moore. Michael Moore is so transparent.  I didn't fall for it and I really can't believe other people did.I think the film did have valid points and could drum up intellectual debate, but weeding through the fiction proved more work than I anticipated from a ""documentary"".",2,Blame Dick Clark.... nice try,1088208000,"06 26, 2004",2004,1447,"['know', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'posting', 'movie', 'hype', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'latest', 'movie', 'However', 'legitimately', 'just', 'saw', 'movie', 'last', 'week', 'first', 'time.I', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'say', 'least', 'was', 'amazed', 'Moore', 'ability', 'manipulate', 'situations', 'suit', 'Most', 'time', 'came', 'off', 'crazy', 'loon', 'asking', 'very', 'stupid', 'questions', 'understand', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'sarcasm', 'sarcasm', 'not', 'first', 'thing', 'think', 'when', 'teens', 'shooting', 'up', 'school.One', 'biggest', 'mistakes', 'opinion', 'was', 'blaming', 'Dick', 'Clark', 'little', 'girl', 'death', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'blame', 'Dick', 'Clark', 'personally', 'also', 'tracked', 'man', 'down', 'try', 'get', 'interview', 'was', 'painful', 'embarrassing', 'watch', 'Moore', 'carry', 'yell', 'Dick', 'Clark', 'side', 'road.Moore', 'also', 'one', 'heck', 'terrible', 'actor', 'Chasing', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Heston', 'home', 'trying', 'get', 'look', 'picture', 'slain', 'girl', 'was', 'ghastly', 'Moore', 'then', 'licked', 'acting', 'chops', 'begged', 'Heston', 'look', 'picture', 'was', 'appalled', 'know', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'appalled', 'Heston', 'refused', 'do', 'instead', 'was', 'appalled', 'Moore', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'so', 'transparent', 'did', ""n't"", 'fall', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'other', 'people', 'did.I', 'think', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'valid', 'points', 'could', 'drum', 'up', 'intellectual', 'debate', 'weeding', 'fiction', 'proved', 'more', 'work', 'anticipated', 'documentary']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

739349,A245AST0T0AZTJ,B00008DDVU,J. Lindner,"[4, 7]","I prefer this Micheal Moore movie to most of his others.  I agree with his point that fear is perhaps the one characteristic that separates Americans from other western cultures.  Each year we are bombarded with images and video that is intended to promote fear in our lives.  Election campaigns teach us to fear one side or the other ratherthan advocating what good a candidate will do.Once fear is in place groups like the National Rifle Association can inform us how we need all sorts of conceal and carry laws because if we don't carry a weapon, sooner or later we will be attacked.  Solve a gun problem with more guns.  It sounds like trying to solve the credit crisis with more credit.  The NRA will say that because we don't know if a person has a gun, we will be less likely to become violent.  Yet 11,000+ people are killed with guns each year.  Only a handful of situations occur where someone with a gun can prenvent a crime.  The NRA also has the audacity to say that more guns in schools will prevent shootings similar to Columbine or Virginia Tech.Micheal Moore tries to flush out myths people tend to blame for shootings.  Violent video games, rock music, even the availability of guns.  Most other countries have all of these, yet they do not have 11,000+ gun-related killings annually.  Again, he may have something with his fear theory.  Like Moore, I too am a member of the NRA and proud of it.  Our constitution gives us the right to own guns and no government can take that right away.

739351,A20U54S8PC1291,B00008DDVU,J. McDonald,"[2, 3]","I originally became aware of Michael Moore after viewing his well known documentary ""Roger and Me"". I enjoyed the film, but unfortunately never found the time to view his later efforts, Fahrenheit 9/11 and Bowling for Columbine. Both films were always on my ""films to watch"" list, but I guess I needed a good kick in the rear to get around to it.I finally got that ""kick"" after watching his Amazing documentary ""Sicko"", which I feel is one of the most important films of the past five years. After being completely awestruck with ""Sicko"", I decided it was time to view both Fahrenheit 9/11 and Bowling for columbine. Here are my thoughts....[SPOILER ALERT] I will be revealing certain aspects of the film within the following portion of my review.While Columbine may be the Oscar winner among his four most known films, I personally found it to be the most amateurish and disappointing. The film slowly constructs a message that I found to be schizophrenic and quite ambiguous. The journalism here could be described as being ""Jeraldo-like"", a simple hodgepodge that fails to deliver a cohesive or fully coherent message of any kind. In fact, part the film speaks of the constant fear generated via the news media, and yet this very film itself, could in some ways, also be considered more of the same.At one point the film suddenly displays a couple of ""death by gun"" scenes in rapid succession, for what appears to be shock value alone. I did not appreciate his careless use of such images. On the other hand, The film later uses graphic imagery to great effect, while making a very important point about U.S. Military actions around the world, throughout history, and the ultimate outcome. It's that kind of schizophrenic approach that detracts from the overall impact of the film.The structure of the film is meandering, and at times I was left wondering, ""what's his point""? The segments with Dick Clark and Charleton Heston seemed contrived. Did you really expect Dick Clark NOT to drive away? Did you really expect Charlton Heston NOT to walk out? The intent of Mr. Moore as interviewer in these scenes seems insincere and scripted to generate the desired (and expected) ""end result"". When interviewing Marilyn Manson, why didn't Mr. Moore ask leading questions regarding the potential harmful effects that his music ""MIGHT"" have on impressionable young minds?I also found the brief excursions into racism, violence in media (video games and entertainment), and extreme Rock Music (Marilyn Manson) to be ineffective. These are all points that definitely need to be discussed when dealing with the main topic at hand, but in the end, once again, we are left with a very ambiguous stance that detracts greatly from any possible impact. One almost gets the feeling that Moore is actually downplaying the impact of violence in media within a society. A very big mistake!Mr. Moore speaks loudly of corporate responsibility (with good reason) and yet seems to gloss over the responsibility of artists, who also have a huge impact on our society. It may be true that citizens in other, less ""gun violent"" countries play the same violent video games and watch the same violent movies, but that surely isn't a stamp of approval (or blame-buster) for such violent creations. You simply cannot gloss over such matters by being one sided and asking an inane question like, ""if you're going to blame Marilyn Manson, why not blame bowling too"". I wonder how long it will be before the rest of the world decides to tune-out all of the ultra-violent media we so kindly spread around the world?I could have also done without the stupid cartoon representing the ""history of America"", and I highly doubt we're going to find the answers to our country's problems by interviewing the creator of South Park.The heart of the film is basically good.

739353,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00008DDVU,Joe Sherry,"[4, 8]","A Film by Michael MooreWinner of the Academy Award for Best Documentary.Michael Moore does a good job of both informing and entertaining in this documentary.  Moore takes a look at the gun culture in America and tries to find out reasons why there might be so many gun related deaths in America as compared to any other country.  As with other works of Michael Moore, he takes some facts and details and makes an emotional case and an emotional argument for his position.  This is something to keep in mind when watching (or even reading) Michael Moore.The film takes a look at the rabid gun culture in America, but as it investigates the most common arguments for why there is so much more gun violence here than in, say, Canada, Moore is able to give strong arguments against those common explanations (we have more guns, history, diversity, movies, etc).  The movie also looks at the Columbine shootings (showing actual footage and using 911 recordings) and also looks at some of the history of America.  In some places America does not come off looking very good, but America's history is not a pristine and spotless history.  The film is both educational and entertaining.Some people have questioned details in Moore's film.  From everything that I have read, Michael Moore stands by the details in the movie.  I am not knowledgeable enough to say who is right and who is wrong, so I'm not even going to attempt to break things down point by point.  Even so, it appears to me that Michael Moore is trying to make more of an emotional impact than a purely logical one.  This is both the greatest strength and weakness of the movie.

739356,A2TDK8D4HEMUYW,B00008DDVU,"John ""MovieAddict""","[3, 9]","Documentaries are probably the hardest types of film to review, primarily because it all comes down to whether or not you agree with the filmmaker or not. Style helps, but you can't recommend a documentary you disagree with, can you?To come out with the truth before I get too far into this review, I will say that I totally disagree with Michael Moore on almost all subjects. To call him a liberal is an understatement -- so from a Republican's standpoint, it's very hard to give his film a good rating.""Bowling for Columbine,"" like most of Moore's films, is seriously flawed. He presents a lot of information as truth when it is clearly not so. As entertaining as the History of the US cartoon was, it was also quite incorrect in many ways, and guess what -- killer bees DID come to America through Texas, even though he states that they never did.He doesn't bash the Bush administration as much as I thought he would, or any real political issues. He basically bashes American culture for allowing guns to flow so freely into the grasps of criminals and children.Moore is a lifetime member of the NRA, but he thinks guns should be handled with more caution. America has the highest rate of weapon-related deaths in all the world, and as this documentary shows, Britain, Canada, and other closely related countries have the exact same films, videogames, weapons, and so on. Why is America's gun crime so high?The film is centered on the Columbine shooting a few years back, when two students walked into Columbine high school and shot students, killing and injuring a large number of innocents. It was a wake up call for most of America, and Moore's real point of the documentary is to explore the reason America is so obsessed with guns.From a critical standpoint, the documentary is well made, probably deserving of its Oscar. It's touching and funny, disturbing and outrageous. Sometimes it's a bit too politically correct -- the whole exploration of African-Americans getting arrested more than Caucasians on the television show ""COPS"" is not only incorrect but sort of a laughable attempt on Moore's part to gain the respect of black viewers. I've watched ""COPS"" before, and a lot of white guys get arrested -- I can think of many arrests off the top of my head. I don't think that it's a valid point at all. America's reported fear of blacks is not why there are more shootings.Two survivors of the Columbine massacre accompany Moore towards the end of the film when he visits the Wal-Mart headquarters and requests that they stop selling 30-cent weapon ammunition -- the same ammunition bought by the Columbine shooters. Wal-Mart agrees, which is why you will no longer see gun ammo in Wal-Marts across the country.When ""Halloween"" came out in 1978, the six-year-old killer, Michael Myers, seemed even more evil and scary because he murdered at such a young age. Nobody thought that there could be a child like that. But, in ""Bowling for Columbine,"" we are informed that a six-year-old school kid shot another young girl of the same age in a school cafeteria one day -- by accident, or so they say. That's when the documentary starts to become a horror film as opposed to an informative film. And it's better for it, too.It is our right as Americans to decide whether or not we should carry guns. I think the restrictions on letting guns fall into the wrong hands could be a bit more strict, but the criminals on the street will achieve weapons irregardless of whether or not Wal-Mart stops selling hunting rifles. In that sense, Moore's documentary is almost pointless. By the end, he never reveals why America is infatuated with guns. But his unresolved insight into why our nature is so influenced by violence is the highlight, and the remaining image of the little girl shot to death by a six-year-old boy will stay with you for a long, long time.Another problem with documentaries is that they can be twisted around and edited into whatever the filmmaker wants -- such as Moore's interview with Charleston Heston at the end of the film, or Dick Clark's refusal to speak to Moore, and so on and so forth. We don't know the background story on these things and we don't know what else was said before Moore fiddled around with the footage and crafted it into what he wanted. Splice together images of Heston saying, ""From my cold dead hands!"" and anything can look bad.""Bowling for Columbine"" is a very good film, and though I do not respect Michael Moore in any way, even I have to admit that he's made a good -- if flawed -- documentary about violence in America. He handles the content with care -- the way it should be handled -- and it can be both hilarious and saddening at the same time. I don't agree with everything in this film, but some of the real facts are pretty haunting. It's definitely one to check out.",4,Bowling for Columbine,1070928000,"12 9, 2003",2003,4832,"['Documentaries', 'are', 'probably', 'hardest', 'types', 'film', 'review', 'primarily', 'down', 'not', 'agree', 'filmmaker', 'not', 'Style', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'documentary', 'disagree', 'can', 'come', 'out', 'truth', 'get', 'too', 'far', 'review', 'will', 'say', 'totally', 'disagree', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'almost', 'subjects', 'call', 'liberal', 'understatement', 'so', 'Republican', 'standpoint', 'very', 'hard', 'give', 'film', 'good', 'rating', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'most', 'Moore', 'films', 'seriously', 'flawed', 'lot', 'information', 'truth', 'when', 'clearly', 'not', 'so', 'entertaining', 'History', 'US', 'cartoon', 'was', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'incorrect', 'many', 'ways', 'guess', 'what', 'killer', 'bees', 'DID', 'come', 'America', 'Texas', 'even', 'never', 'did.He', ""n't"", 'bash', 'Bush', 'administration', 'as', 'much', 'thought', 'would', 'real', 'political', 'issues', 'basically', 'American', 'culture', 'allowing', 'guns', 'flow', 'so', 'freely', 'grasps', 'criminals', 'children.Moore', 'lifetime', 'member', 'NRA', 'guns', 'should', 'be', 'handled', 'more', 'caution', 'America', 'highest', 'rate', 'weapon-related', 'deaths', 'world', 'documentary', 'Britain', 'Canada', 'other', 'closely', 'related', 'countries', 'have', 'exact', 'same', 'films', 'videogames', 'weapons', 'so', 'Why', 'America', 'gun', 'crime', 'so', 'high', 'film', 'centered', 'Columbine', 'shooting', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'when', 'two', 'students', 'walked', 'Columbine', 'high', 'school', 'shot', 'students', 'killing', 'injuring', 'large', 'number', 'innocents', 'was', 'wake', 'up', 'call', 'most', 'America', 'Moore', 'real', 'point', 'documentary', 'explore', 'reason', 'America', 'so', 'obsessed', 'guns.From', 'critical', 'standpoint', 'documentary', 'well', 'made', 'probably', 'deserving', 'Oscar', 'touching', 'funny', 'disturbing', 'outrageous', 'bit', 'too', 'politically', 'correct', 'whole', 'exploration', 'African-Americans', 'getting', 'arrested', 'more', 'Caucasians', 'television', 'show', 'COPS', 'not', 'only', 'incorrect', 'sort', 'laughable', 'attempt', 'Moore', 'part', 'gain', 'respect', 'black', 'viewers', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'COPS', 'lot', 'white', 'guys', 'get', 'arrested', 'can', 'think', 'many', 'arrests', 'top', 'head', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'valid', 'point', 'America', 'reported', 'fear', 'blacks', 'not', 'why', 'are', 'more', 'shootings.Two', 'survivors', 'Columbine', 'massacre', 'accompany', 'Moore', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'Wal-Mart', 'headquarters', 'requests', 'stop', 'selling', '30-cent', 'weapon', 'ammunition', 'same', 'ammunition', 'bought', 'Columbine', 'shooters', 'Wal-Mart', 'agrees', 'why', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'see', 'gun', 'ammo', 'Wal-Marts', 'country.When', 'Halloween', 'came', 'out', '1978', 'six-year-old', 'killer', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'seemed', 'even', 'more', 'evil', 'scary', 'murdered', 'young', 'age', 'Nobody', 'thought', 'could', 'be', 'child', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'are', 'informed', 'six-year-old', 'school', 'kid', 'shot', 'young', 'girl', 'same', 'age', 'school', 'cafeteria', 'one', 'day', 'accident', 'so', 'say', 'when', 'documentary', 'become', 'horror', 'film', 'opposed', 'informative', 'film', 'better', 'right', 'Americans', 'decide', 'not', 'should', 'carry', 'guns', 'think', 'restrictions', 'letting', 'guns', 'fall', 'wrong', 'hands', 'could', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'strict', 'criminals', 'street', 'will', 'achieve', 'weapons', 'irregardless', 'not', 'Wal-Mart', 'stops', 'selling', 'hunting', 'rifles', 'sense', 'Moore', 'documentary', 'almost', 'pointless', 'end', 'never', 'why', 'America', 'infatuated', 'guns', 'unresolved', 'insight', 'why', 'nature', 'so', 'influenced', 'violence', 'highlight', 'remaining', 'image', 'little', 'girl', 'shot', 'death', 'six-year-old', 'boy', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'long', 'time.Another', 'problem', 'documentaries', 'can', 'be', 'twisted', 'edited', 'filmmaker', 'such', 'Moore', 'interview', 'Charleston', 'Heston', 'end', 'film', 'Dick', 'Clark', 'refusal', 'speak', 'Moore', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'background', 'story', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'else', 'was', 'said', 'Moore', 'fiddled', 'around', 'footage', 'crafted', 'what', 'wanted', 'Splice', 'together', 'images', 'Heston', 'saying', 'cold', 'dead', 'hands', 'anything', 'can', 'look', 'bad', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'respect', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'way', 'even', 'have', 'admit', 'made', 'good', 'flawed', 'documentary', 'violence', 'America', 'content', 'care', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'handled', 'can', 'be', 'hilarious', 'saddening', 'same', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'everything', 'film', 'real', 'facts', 'are', 'pretty', 'haunting', 'definitely', 'one', 'check', 'out']",Bowling For Columbine VHS
739357,ABX7SEE84DMLU,B00008DDVU,John P Bernat,"[5, 9]","""Roger and Me"" was really, really funny in its own way.  You did not have to like Moore's politics to appreciate the skillful wit displayed in that movie.Let's be honest:  the guy's a Communist.  In a day when Communism has been proven to be an abject failure as a philosophy and political system, why get mad at him?  It's like being outraged at someone for being a Zoroastrian.We're all entitled to our opinions in our country.  Moore is entitled to his, and wants us to hear all of them.  And he's won some awards, and he's making plenty of money.But honestly, he's better when he's funny.  In this movie, for example, there is some funny stuff, but it is really a seemingly honest exploration of three things:1.  Why do we like our guns so much?2.  Why do we use them to kill each other so frequently?3.  Moore [a successful creature of the media] wants to know why the media fascinate us so much.  Weird.It's a fine movie, containing nowhere near the intentional missatements of fact that plague ""Fahrenheit 9/11.""  And it has some funny moments in discussing such serious subjects...but:In this movie he celebrates a ""win:""  because he brings Columbine shooting victims to K-Mart, K-Mart agrees to quit selling ammunition.  What's really enlightening is that this moment reveals something of Moore:  while he expresses appreciation, he does not seem much happy.  In fact, his affect (not his words) expresses a measure of disappointment.So, his emotional game is never to be happy.  And never to project happiness.  He is a chronically dissatisfied person.This chronic dissatisfaction, like Jerry Seinfeld's, can be a source of really considerable amusement.  But now, in and after this movie, Moore takes himself very, very seriously, and this film marks one of those significant transitions.Moore thus has begun walking the road to his own doom.  He has begun believing his own press releases.He sees himself as a social symbol larger than he can ever possibly be as a human being.  See, he lacks optimism and generosity of spirit - two qualities essential for any true leader.  You cannot be followed or respected solely by villainizing other people.You can, however, be funny, and Moore's no longer content with that media identity.

Call the liberal police, even though he's basically stating the obvious. In fact, one of the main points Mike stressed in this film was that other countries who own the same percentage of guns as the U.S. don't have the same problems with violence that we do.Some have criticized this movie for not answering the thesis Moore proposes at the beginning of the movie. However, the way I see it, we can thank Mike for not ham-handedly selecting a scapegoat for our problems with violence in the U.S.But back to my original point, Mike's message is not a pro-gun control or anti-gun one, but rather an anti-fear movie. Why, then, is everyone so up in arms (pun fully intended) about it? Mike, once again you have made Flint proud.

They say that he's just into making documentaries for the money, the impact of his documentaries sometimes does more harm than good, some of his facts are wrong, he edits scenes to make them fit better for the points he's trying to make, and on and on and on.  Americans on the whole should salute this guy.  At least he's doing something about what's wrong with our corrupt and heavily flawed society, while all the complainers sit back and do nothing.  Or, they themselves are guilty of a lot of the things that Michael Moore presents in his documentaries, so they hate him for exposing the truth.  This guy is a great American.  From ""Roger and Me"" to the present day, his documentaries shed light on the appalling things that go on in our society.  So many Americans are tunnel-visioned and can't see the big picture.  Or, they have their heads in the sand altogether.  In contrast, Michael Moore sees the big picture and shares it with the world.  Not everybody agrees with him, but at least he's out there looking out for us.In a nutshell, Bowling For Columbine (2002) sheds light on the causes of violence and gun use in American society and the overall negative impact these things have.  Of course, this information presented in this documentary doesn't apply to everyone.  Not everyone is going to have a warped mind as a result of playing video games or playing with toy guns.  This documentary compares American society to other countries as well.  In my opinion, it's a fair and balanced documentary.

I am not here to tell you my opinions on the issue this country has been debating for. All I am here to tell you, is that you should take the time to watch this movie.Bowling for Columbine strikes the hearts of its audience. Michael Moore goes out of his way to truly research and create a wonderful documentary on the history of violence and the impact it has on America, mostly by way of guns.Michael Moore interviews various people, Charlton Heston, two survivors from the Columbine high school shooting, a few Canadians and Canadian authorities, and one of the creators of South Park.Moore doesnt truly take a side until the end, he is mostly trying to help the viewer take a side. Not by pushing the viewer, but by asking questions, letting the audience form their own answers. That is what a documentary is all about. Delivering the facts to the audience. With such an emotional topic, Michael Moore does a splendid job with this.The documentary shows how some people are off camera, when you expect human compassion and instead get the human that cares for greed.Michael Moore has been called anti-american, because of this documentary. What is more unamerican? Trying to understand why the death toll in America is over 11,000 by guns, and in other countries even below 300, or letting people kill each other without saying anything at all?

After viewing this documentary, I don't agree with that assessment about Michael, however, the movie has left a lot unresolved for this viewer.Michael Moore is someone who can create a mood that is clear, somewhat one sided and can really get to the viewer, however, what was his point here?He takes a rather wide swipe at America as a whole using two shootings that just happen to have an NRA meeting on the heals of them, one of course in Columbine High, and the other in his hometown of Flint Michigan.  The irony here is devastingly clear.Michael takes on people from every side in this video, the NRA headed up by Charlton Heston, the military industrial complex, the media, Clinton for his role in the bombings in Kosovo, Bush post 9-11 and a large budget for the war machine, Kerry is viewed quickly.  So, although mostly seeming to blame the current administration, he finds fault with the American system as a major culprit.Yet, what is he asking us to do?  The reason I rated this a &quot;4&quot; was the impact that it had on me, especially but for the view that we are a society that is living in fear.  We hear about things all day long that make us afraid, and his vignettes regarding fear are well put together to get the viewer to acknowledge we are taught to fear.However, Michael takes on a somewhat cordial man who invites him into his home, Heston, and seems to ambush him during his interview.  He weaves together pictures making it seem that Heston is referring to a quote, ....from my cold dead hands.... that you may think was voiced immediately after Columbine in the NRA, apparently national conference, obviously scheduled months prior to the massacre.  That quote and very brief video clip is from some time later.  The remainder of the clip is from the Heston speech in Denver.  (to get a great view of the whole text of Hestons speech go to Michael's website, yet you may want to peruse the web also.)His story about Flint though is very touching indeed and we all need to take notice that we need to solve our national problems and quickly.  He shows how the welfare to work program has further hurt those that it was supposed to free from welfare.  He does not do so objectively though and we are given the perspective that the current administration was the one who came up with that.....although not expressed, you get that feel.Michael would have hit his mark in this film like he did in Roger and Me if he would have tackled things much more objectively.  He goes after the person whose name is on the restaurant of an employee involved in the movie.....there are implications that he is responsible for her situation.  What is he wanting that man to do?  We never know and we are left wondering what Michael's intent is in tracking him down.If I had the chance to ask MM some things I would want to know what he is doing as an American, who has made millions by selling his very interesting material, what is he doing for Flint, for the high school in the video with facilities that are lacking?  I mean I do not expect him to flaunt what he does, but is he helping in any way to assist the needy?I feel Michael does his part in pointing out things in our society that should create concern and motivate us to change.

739365,A2WTN1GAIBOZU,B00008DDVU,J. Pinkerton Snoopington,"[3, 7]","Michael Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine"" is a riveting and electrifying documentary. Focusing on gun control (although topics also range from American history to violence in the media), it's powerful and often hilarious. Moore makes an engaging on-screen host, and the little vignettes he strings together are often hilarious, such as the history cartoon and the interview with the guy linked to the Oklahoma city bombing. Other scenes are truly powerhouse filmmaking, like the Columbine surveillance footage and the unforgettable showdown with Charlton Heston. The film is weighed down a bit by Moore's tweaking of the truth (like in the staged opening scene and the tricky editing of Heston's NRA speeches) and his occasionally insane arguments (like linking Dick Clarke to a school shooting), but overall, it's memorable and worth seeing.On DVD, the film is in an aspect ratio of roughly 1.85:1. Being a documentary with much footage taken from news shows, the image quality varies, and is sometimes quite grainy. It looks and sounds as good as it should. Of the abundant extras, the most worthwhile is Moore's fifteen-minute defense of his famous Oscar acceptance speech (""Shame on you, Mr. Bush!""). There is a lot of interview footage with Moore at various film festivals and on various shows to a point at which there's almost too much Moore.

This controversial documentary only uses that event as an example of a notoriously unique aspect of the United States way of life: the huge number of firearms among common citizens, and the final results when you live in a society where media vehicles, to make money and get audience rates, insists in installing an overpowering fear through the population. Moore's intention with this award winning movie is to understand why this happens.As a documentary written, directed and starred by a single person, of course it's subjective. Michael Moore tends to manipulate numbers and some facts to achieve his final goals. What is most interesting in "" Bowling for Columbine"" is the series of interviews with interesting people such as Marilyn Manson, Troy Parker and Charlton Heston, among others, and their opinions about the population having this huge amount of firearms close at hand.So, watching  ""Bowling for Columbine"" is only Phase 1 of something everybody should know and care about. Phase 2 is to get more information about all the subjects and situations portrayed in the movie, and to decide how right (or how wrong) Moore is, and what should be done about the problem. Because, whatever the reasons, causes, etc., there surely is a problem.

And, it shows how much he loves America and believes in its people and their potential. In fact, he may have created the most important film of our time.I feel it is important to write this review because some of the reviewers think Michael Moore (and this film) is anti-gun. They also think he wants us to walk away angry. I disagree. Michael Moore shows us his NRA life-time member card as well as his trophies won in shooting contests. The main theme of the film is, why does America have over 10,000 homicides a year when other countries with just as many guns and ethnicities have under 1,000? Why do Americas keep guns in the house that are not used for sport, fully loaded, when in other countries people (who own guns for sport) don't? Why do Americans, who statistically are in no more danger of being the victim of a crime than anyone in any other part of the world, distrust their neighbor to this extent?He also delves into the subject of whether we should blame rock music for the violent behavior of high school students, and if so, why not also blame bowling (which is what the kids who blew up Columbine did before they went on their rampage)?  But seriously, he seems to say -- why not blame ourselves? After all, on the same day, America was bombing a third-world country.Moore also confronts the very important but little-mentioned fact that the media exploits crime, exacerbating peoples' fears, and in doing so, exploits the idea that most criminals are black and hispanic (he fully exploits the irony, that the media blows up petty crimes of minorities while caucasion white-collar executives at companies such as Enron and WorldCom are taking the economy of our entire country into a downward spiral).Bowling for Columbine gives all of us much to think about, and hopefully will be seen by as many people as possible. Films like this can help us all to remember our responsibility as citizens, not to allow ourselves to act out of fear, but instead, out of love for our neighbor and hope for the world that our children will inherit.",5,Should be required viewing for all Americans,1035504000,"10 25, 2002",2002,2240,"['Just', 'want', 'add', 'vote', 'documentary', 'Moore', 'best', 'film', 'technically', 'cleanest', 'editing', 'most', 'beautiful', 'fluid', 'visual', 'sound', 'choreography', 'past', '3', 'films', 'how', 'much', 'America', 'people', 'potential', 'fact', 'may', 'have', 'created', 'most', 'important', 'film', 'time.I', 'feel', 'important', 'write', 'review', 'reviewers', 'think', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'film', 'anti-gun', 'also', 'think', 'walk', 'away', 'angry', 'disagree', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'NRA', 'life-time', 'member', 'card', 'as', 'well', 'trophies', 'won', 'shooting', 'contests', 'main', 'theme', 'film', 'why', 'America', 'have', '10,000', 'homicides', 'year', 'when', 'other', 'countries', 'just', 'many', 'guns', 'ethnicities', 'have', '1,000', 'Why', 'do', 'keep', 'guns', 'house', 'are', 'not', 'used', 'sport', 'fully', 'loaded', 'when', 'other', 'countries', 'people', 'who', 'own', 'guns', 'sport', 'do', ""n't"", 'Why', 'do', 'Americans', 'who', 'statistically', 'are', 'more', 'danger', 'being', 'victim', 'crime', 'anyone', 'other', 'part', 'world', 'distrust', 'neighbor', 'extent', 'also', 'subject', 'should', 'blame', 'rock', 'music', 'violent', 'behavior', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'also', 'blame', 'bowling', 'what', 'kids', 'who', 'blew', 'up', 'Columbine', 'did', 'went', 'rampage', 'seriously', 'say', 'why', 'not', 'blame', 'same', 'day', 'America', 'was', 'bombing', 'third-world', 'country.Moore', 'also', 'very', 'important', 'little-mentioned', 'fact', 'media', 'exploits', 'crime', 'exacerbating', 'peoples', 'fears', 'doing', 'so', 'idea', 'most', 'criminals', 'are', 'black', 'hispanic', 'fully', 'irony', 'media', 'up', 'petty', 'crimes', 'minorities', 'caucasion', 'white-collar', 'executives', 'companies', 'such', 'Enron', 'WorldCom', 'are', 'taking', 'economy', 'entire', 'country', 'downward', 'spiral', '.Bowling', 'Columbine', 'much', 'think', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'many', 'people', 'possible', 'Films', 'can', 'help', 'remember', 'responsibility', 'citizens', 'not', 'allow', 'act', 'fear', 'instead', 'love', 'neighbor', 'hope', 'world', 'children', 'will', 'inherit']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

Cicconi ""MST junkie""","[15, 36]","In this horribly one sided excuse for a documentary Mr. Moore shows Americans as gun-toting murderers, The fact that this won an Oscar is a sham. Moore misrepresented facts, and spliceed together interviews to make is opponants seem cold-blooded and mean. Throught the film he preaches in such a sickiningly self-righteous mannner that i as liberal and registered Democrat(someone Moore was aiming the picture towards, i imagine) was sickened by his tone. Moore fails to take his opponants seriiously instead he mocks them, and smugly tells us his ""facts"". Moore mentions that Canada, the U.K. and Germany have lower gun-related deaths than we do, he grouped all deaths together, leaving out self-defense, accidents and suicides, which are not murders. The fact that Moore blamed the Work-for welfare for the tragedy in Flint, Michigan, shows how Moore disregards other factors, that have contributed to the tragidies, and instead consentrates on things that are perhaps remotely responsible. We should have sticter gun laws, yes, but a piece of biased trash like this hurts the gun-control supporters. Watching Moore exploit the tragedies in Flint and columbine is sickening, almost as sickening as his being rewarded with an oscar for this ""film"".

Moore raises more questions than he provides answers to, which was his point.  Why DON'T they have the kind of homicide rate in Canada that we do, when there are seven million guns in ten million homes up there?If you draw you own conclusions though, you can see his point.  It totally IS the media.  I don't mean video games, Hollywood bloodbaths, and Marilyn Manson (which Moore points out are just as frequently devoured in Canada and elsewhere).  I'm talking about the NEWS.  Government propaganda and how the news media puts a spin on it.  I think that we as human beings can differentiate between a violent video game and real violence.  It's called human intelligence.  But when all we hear on the news is tragedy after tragedy after tradgedy, we come to believe our neighborhoods and towns are more dangerous than they really are.  That breeds fear, which breeds violence, which breeds more fear, and the vicious cycle keeps going on and on.  THIS is Moore's theme not just in the Canada section, but throughout the film.Here's another interesting point.  Michael points out that the U.S. is capitalist in the extreme.  I used to be undecided on nationalized health care, but now I support it.  I originally bought in to Jesse Ventura's argument against nationalized health care, which is that when you only get one provider, you get corruption.  However, I've changed my mind on that.  Nationalized health care works in every other 1st-world, freeworld country: the UK, Canada, Spain, France, Germany... We're essentially a society that says, ""If you can bust through college and work your way into the white-collar sector and land a job with a Fortune 500 corporation, THEN you've earned the right to not have to worry about health care.""Moore suggests, and I agree, that it's that kind of Darwinist, survival-of-the-fittest mentality about our country that causes people to snap and commit carnage.Outstanding work.  Every American, heck every human, needs to view this one.PS Though I disagree with Jesse Ventura on healthcare, he is another one of my social heroes, after reading his book ""Do I Stand Alone?""

Certainly, one of the most convincing passages of the movie for me was a segment in the middle that showed how fearmongering our media can be, and how they can sometimes drum up too much fear in all of us simply by how they choose what stories to cover (&quot;if it bleeds, it leads&quot;). After watching that, I don't think anyone can ever truly be wholly uncritical of the media ever again.So, okay, Michael Moore has the unfortunate reputation of sometimes staging what seems like &quot;found&quot; events in his films, and you cannot always trust what Moore claims to be fact in them. And some of those stunts he thinks of for his films---there's one here in which he takes two victims of Columbine and brings them to a local Walmart in an attempt to force them to faze out the selling of bullets, a stunt which actually works---can sometimes be more a debit to his argument than a credit (Moore admittedly does sometimes come off as overly smug, in here and his most recent film, FAHRENHEIT 9/11, also a great film.)Yet, one must admit that Moore is a tremendous moviemaker, who makes his films out of passion and a need to throw certain topics into the realm of public forum via the medium of film. And if his overall message sometimes feels muddled during the course of BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE---what is he really trying to say by connecting the fact that Columbine happened on the same day as one of the biggest days of bombing in Kosovo?---well, maybe that is merely the sign of a man searching for some kind of truth in a muddled political field.

OK, after doing so, instead of America having 10 times as many deaths as the rest combined, it is only 4 times as much.Another docked Moore for harassing bank clerks and receptionists, etc. Not very accurate. At the bank, he asked a few questions about the gun-give-away offer and made some jokes about proper spelling on forms. At the one clinic that did possibly dangerous bugspray testing on uninformed humans, he did get in people faces, trying to locate the previously convicted, now released, doctor.He also asked many people to explain their positions, such as NRA prez Heston - who blames racism, and says ""we had a lot of problems with civil rights"". Heston also seemed unaffected that his NRA rally was asked by the mayor not to come to Littleton, near Columbine, shortly after the tragedy. In fact, he says (believe it or not) that he and the NRA was unaware that a 6-year old shot another 6-year old in Flint, just one week earlier than another pep rally. Hmmm.Moore, with some injured Columbine survivors, essentially invaded K-Mart headquarters, and eventually got them to not sell hand-gun ammo.Lots of comedy, lots of tragedy. There is no such thing as a objective documentary, by the way.The DVD has some question-answer bits at various colleges, Moore's appearance on ""The Charlie Rose Show"", his ""explanation"" of his Oscar acceptance speech (not shown cuz he could not get clearance), and other bits.

739380,A2460ZRFVC2YGV,B00008DDVU,Kristopher Haines,"[3, 8]","I like Michael Moore's films and Bowling For Columbine is no exception. In fact, I've seen it twice. (Something I rarely do.) Plus, I've begun to watch tapes of his TV shows and I will be one of the first in line to see his next effort. I think Michael Moore comes across as a man of great conscience. He uses his camera as a mighty weapon against injustice where ever it may hide and this includes topics the mainstream media will not touch. Particularly corporate crime. It takes a scandal of monumental proportions such as Enron to even register on the radar screens of the major news outlets. There is much to be proud of in Bowling for Columbine, but there are also some things for which Michael Moore should be ashamed. Michael Moore should be thrilled that he was able to play a part in ridding K-Mart of its bullets, it would not have been done but for the deadly aim of his lens. That is by far the most powerful scene in the film. Yet, he uses the same tactics in one of the most heartless scenes ever-committed film, the cinematic sucker punch of NRA president Heston. Yes, we got to see Mr. Heston humiliate himself by suggesting that America's gun violence is due to the fact that we are &quot;ethically mixed.&quot; Heston said it of his own free will and he should be held accountable for it. It's what Moore does next that is despicable. He chases Heston with a picture of Kayla Roland and leaves it outside his house when he refuses to look at it. Heston DID NOT deserve that. There are other things in the film that are not shameful but rather absurd. The day of the massacre at Columbine was also the day of the most aggressive US bombing of Kosovo; I will concede this was an ironic coincidence. Moore takes it a step further; he tries to compare Lockeed Martin's production of WMDs with the carnage at Columbine. That's just silly, and according to another reviewer that plant may not even make WMDs. Oh, and let's not forget Moore's undying love for Canada. Moore could very well have a point about Canada being less violent, I don't know, I haven't looked into it. But does it strike anyone else as a little odd that Bowling For Columbine would be produced by Alliance Atlantis, a Canadian company? Its things like these that serve to weaken an otherwise strong film. Moore might also have a point about the media helping to create a more fearful America, but that was no more a cause of the murders at Columbine than shock rock, video games/movies, or even *sarcastic laugh* lack of prayer in schools. Everyone wants to know why Columbine happened and they seem to forget that the killers have already told us. They said, &quot;we're doing this because you made fun of us.&quot; The siege at Columbine was the reaction of two teenagers pushed over the edge by merciless ridicule. Of course this doesn't excuse what they did, but you cannot ignore that this is an answer almost unanimously echoed by other school shooters. The most perplexing moment in the entire film comes when Moore speaks to a group of Canadian teenagers about what they would do instead of picking up a gun. Shockingly they said they would tease the aggressor into submission. This suggestion was made by the one with green hair and a face piercing, the type of person that typically gets harassed at a regular high school. I know because many of them came to the arts magnet high school I attended to escape such things.Last but not least I would like to address Moore's now infamous Academy Awards acceptance speech. I think he should be absolutely ashamed, and should have issued an immediate apology. What he said is irrelevant. I have a problem with when and where he said it. I am sick of celebrities thinking that just because they are famous everyone wants to hear their opinion. Richard Gere comes dangerously close to condoning the events of September 11th in a room full of firemen, Sean Penn takes it upon himself to prove there are no WMDs in Iraq, and the Dixie Chicks insult the President on foreign soil. That incident is my favorite because their comments finally fell on very unfriendly ears, which just happened to be the ears of their fans. I thought that incident would turn into a public relations firestorm from which they would never recover, and as such serve as a lesson to other entertainers that the world is not their pulpit. Alas, the backlash was ridiculously short-lived. I find Michael Moore's rant to be particularly disappointing because unlike Gere, Penn and the Dixie Chicks, Michael Moore could have said something of great importance, let's not forget that Moore was given those five minutes to reflect on his film, and on Columbine. Instead he wasted it on something that was completely unrelated. For those who say that ""Bowling for Columbine"" wasn't just about Columbine, then I would argue that using the tragedy to try and make a ""larger point about American violence,"" which is a polite way of saying ""to further another agenda"" (a spin on par with those spewed by O'Reily) is a shameful an exploitive thing to do.",3,"I liked it, but....",1083974400,"05 8, 2004",2004,5054,"['like',

And the part about the day of the Columbine shootings is genuinely moving, which I wouldn't have expected given the (often trite) overexposure it's gotten other places.The best part of the entire movie, perhaps the best 10 or so minutes of documentary film-making I've seen in years, was the section on the school shooting in Flint, Michigan, in which a 6-year-old boy shot and killed a 6-year-old girl with a gun he found where he and his mother were staying because they'd been evicted from their home.  The mother was on Michigan's welfare-to-work program and couldn't pay her rent despite working 70 hours a week.  That part of the movie is a horrifyingly powerful indictment of how this country treats its poor, and it's to the credit of the Flint public officials that Moore interviews that they understand the connection between that family's poverty and the little girl's death.""Bowling for Columbine"" is about 20-30 minutes too long, and by the time you get to his interview with Charlton Heston it's like ""enough already--we already know that Charlton Heston is a big jerk, why do we need 10 more minutes about what a jerk he is?""  But then, the thing I don't like about Moore is precisely his seeming belief that if he shows what creeps his opponents are, he will have made his political point.  You can get some cheap laughs from the fact that Heston is not just a jerk but also apparently a doddering fool, but it doesn't really contribute to the movie's argument.  It's a gimmick and nothing more.  Individual people can be jerks, can do horribly offensive things, but a problem like the one this movie addresses -- that Americans are so prone to shooting each other -- is not attributable to one or two or ten people.  It's a broader societal and cultural problem and Moore is at his best when he treats it as such.",4,"I laughed, I cried, I got a little bored by the end",1037232000,"11 14, 2002",2002,2068,"[""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'fan', 'think', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'thing', 'done', 'are', 'just', 'amazingly', 'funny', 'parts', 'interview', 'Terry', 'Nichols', 'brother', 'organic', 'tofu', 'farmer', 'gun', 'enthusiast', 'part', 'day', 'Columbine', 'shootings', 'genuinely', 'moving', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'expected', 'given', 'often', 'trite', 'overexposure', 'gotten', 'other', 'places.The', 'best', 'part', 'entire', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'best', '10', 'so', 'minutes', 'documentary', 'film-making', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'was', 'section', 'school', 'shooting', 'Flint', 'Michigan', '6-year-old', 'boy', 'shot', 'killed', '6-year-old', 'girl', 'gun', 'found', 'where', 'mother', 'were', 'staying', ""'d"", 'been', 'evicted', 'home', 'mother', 'was', 'Michigan', 'welfare-to-work', 'program', 'could', ""n't"", 'pay', 'rent', 'working', '70', 'hours', 'week', 'part', 'movie', 'horrifyingly', 'powerful', 'indictment', 'how', 'country', 'poor', 'credit', 'Flint', 'public', 'officials', 'Moore', 'interviews', 'understand', 'connection', 'family', 'poverty', 'little', 'girl', 'death', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', '20-30', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'interview', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'enough', 'already', 'already', 'know', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'big', 'jerk', 'why', 'do', 'need', '10', 'more', 'minutes', 'what', 'jerk', 'then', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Moore', 'precisely', 'seeming', 'belief', 'what', 'opponents', 'are', 'will', 'have', 'made', 'political', 'point', 'can', 'get', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'fact', 'Heston', 'not', 'just', 'jerk', 'also', 'apparently', 'doddering', 'fool', ""n't"", 'really', 'contribute', 'movie', 'argument', 'gimmick', 'nothing', 'more', 'Individual', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'jerks', 'can', 'do', 'horribly', 'offensive', 'things', 'problem', 'one', 'movie', 'Americans', 'are', 'so', 'prone', 'shooting', 'other', 'not', 'attributable', 'one', 'two', 'ten', 'people', 'broader', 'societal', 'cultural', 'problem', 'Moore', 'best', 'when', 'such']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

While Moore nicely avoids the real problem at stake in terms of the tragedy of the title (these two boys did not shoot up a high school cafeteria just because they owned guns) he nonetheless takes time to satirize enough political figures and famous faces to make the insulting trip worthwhile. America has problems, yes, but that's not what permitted the Columbine tragedy. Moore can be funny, but the climactic attack on Heston seems both unfair and unnecessary; I am a bit biased here because I like Heston, but I'm equally tired of people complaining about children getting killed by guns but having no issue living in a gun-toting country--can you spell &#34;contradiction&#34;?As for the presentation on the DVD, the picture is a bit rough, but no worse than VHS quality. The extras make it worthwhile, however. The Charlie Rose segment is worth watching, but a bit brief in my opinion. For kicks, the Marilyn Manson video has been included. Moore has, like the much touted Quentin Tarantino, become a fixture on the comedic celebrity circuit, and it is, probably, better than working for a living. However, the intellectual bankruptcy is apparent from the very beginning, so be warned. He's out to amuse and to insult, not to inform or to inspire. Nonetheless, he's the cash king on the quasi-documentary circuit.Is &#34;Bowling for Columbine&#34; a must? Absolutely not.

So does Michael Moore, the confrontational documentary filmmaker who's not afraid to take on some sacred cows.  He goes after his prey with unrelenting forcefulness.  His [tool], however, is a microphone and a film crew.  And his prey are often unwitting accomplices to the concepts he wants to introduce.  He'll use film clips and newsreel footage and music as well as interviews.  And he sure knows how to play with his audience's emotions to make his point. In this case it's an exploration of gun violence in America.We see Moore opening a bank account in Michigan and receiving a gun as a premium.  We see newsreel footage of the Columbine tragedy and  meet two young survivors who still have bullets in their bodies. We see an interview with an unsuspecting Charlton Heston. The film keeps probing and travels from incident to incident in a seemingly random way.  And yet it keeps escalating in intensity.In spite of its somber subject, the film is ultimately entertaining.  I laughed out loud at the comic, Chris Rock, who suggested that if bullets cost [a fortune] apiece, there would be no innocent bystanders.  I wept real tears at the film clip of the World Trade Center collapsing.  And I'm doing some deep thinking about the statistics.  Yes, it's true that America has a violent past.  But it's certainly not more violent than the pasts of Germany or France or England, where it's difficult to obtain guns and where there are just a handful gun crimes each year.  But then there is Canada, which also has only a small amount of gun crimes.  And, in Canada, gun possession is as common as in the United States.  So what kinds of conclusion can we draw?  I can't think of any easy answers.  And neither can Moore.  And this is the strength of this film.  It asks questions.  It doesn't give answers.I give this film a high recommendation.  Don't miss it.  It will give you something to think about.  And you'll want to talk about it too.",5,Exploring gun violence in America.

Michael Moore's point seems to be that Americans are more violent than other people, I have no idea whether this is ture or not.  Does he want to ban guns? I couldn't quite  make out exactly what he wanted.  He is very fond of following people around with a camera and trying to interview them, but i understand he doesn't much care for it when others do the same to him.  I heard he got someone thrown in jail for pestering him in a similar manner?  Is this true?  I would love to know.  He succeeded in irritating Charlton Heston, i rather hoped Mr. Heston might take a swing at him, but instead he just walked away, somewhat to my dissapointment.  He seems to approve of Canada, where apparently it's so safe people don't even lock their doors.  this, if true, is very dissapointing.  I had the impression that Canada was a sinister, dangerous country full of vampires, werewolves, deomns, ghosts, ghouls, and entrances to Hell.  This is because I spend too much time reading the novels of Tanya Huff, who has succeeded in making Canada a very exciting place, to me anyway.  Michael moore has really dissillusioned me.  Would gun control make America less violent?

Apart from KINGPIN, the ""CITIZEN KANE"" of bowl-a-dramas, the most legendary tales of balls and gutters have proven as elusive as a perfect-fitting pair of time-worn rental shoes on Family Bowling Night...until now.  At first glance, you probably would not take star Michael Moore for a particularly graceful bowler, but it's truly a thing of beauty to watch this man balling the pins.  For Moore, the bowling alley became his Finishing School, for it is there that he learned to master a poise and form that few men of his girth can lay claim to.But Moore's is just one of the stories this emotionally honest and heartfelt film has to tell; one of the most amusing and unusual episodes is the tale of Burty Bob, ""the Human Bowling Ball,"" who belied convention by hurtling down an alley like a 200lb. projectile and slamming the pins over with his noggin.  For Burty, cracking his skull open every Friday night was no sacrifice at all, because it ""personalized"" the game for him and ""upped his chances with the ladies.""  By far my favourite segment is the moving tale of Doris Little, a Missouri housewife who nearly lost her husband when he was struck by an errant bowling ball as he waited in line for a bag of Cheeto's at the snack bar.  As husband Danny lies comatose awaiting medical attention in alley #8, Doris picks up a bowling bowl for the first time in her life and, with five consecutive strikes, proceeds to win the championship for her husband's Mmm-mmm Muffins! team.  It's impossible not to become a little misty-eyed when Danny Little miraculously regains consciousness to see Doris and the boys presented with the winning trophy,  though the potent odour of the Cheeto's paramedics had been frantically waving before his nostrils may ultimately have played a greater role in rousing Mr. Little from his coma.Brimming with honest emotion and resounding with the effervescent echoes of a championship season,  BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE may well be the most inspiring sports movie since the original ROCKY, and you don't even have to rent a pair of shoes to get in the game.",5,AMAZING!

Quido ""quidrock""","[2, 4]","I wish I'd taken the time to go all the way to the ""artistic theater"" in my city to see Michael Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine"" last winter.  Instead, in waiting for the DVD, I've had my reaction to the actual film blunted by Moore's antics at the Oscars, and, to a degree, by all the ""extras"" in the second disc of this set.You start out believing this is a film about gun control.  Don't get me wrong, I think that is what Moore had in mind.  But as he meanders through the facets of the issues (and he does it admirably), the most compelling question arises...when did Americans start having to be afraid to live here?  When did the violence in our society begin to affect the way we feel about our lives, and what role does the media play in sensationalizing the dark side of society and underplaying what is good about America?I've read the scathing reviews here about how Moore's film is ""not really a documentary"", just a film piece to portray an unanswerable question and the issues from his point of view.  OK, you're right about one thing.  It's not a documentary, it's a thought-provoking film.  So, it didn't really HAVE a category in the Oscars (kind of non-fiction films???)and shouldn't have won the award.Moving right along, it is doubtless that Moore filmed more of a ""spoof"" of some things than a true nonfiction piece...the vignette about the bank that gives away guns and the ""History of America"" presentation.  Moore's scene with Dick Clark and his editorializing about Welfare to Work -- neither one of them should have survived the cutting floor.  What he needed to present was the thought that many children get involved in violent acts and come to possess guns (and drugs, etc.), because their time with thoughtful parental mentoring is limited.  That's true, but for reasons far more numerous that because of ""Welfare to Work"".For most of the film Moore acts like a reasonable artist, and invokes thoughtful and insightful scenes, like the dialogue with Marilyn Manson, with Matt Stone, with the principal at the Buell school,in a fair presentation of the Michigan Militia, in much (not all) of the Heston interview and in the coup he pulled off by nonviolent protest at K-Mart headquarters in Troy, Michigan.  Moore never tells us why Americans are so afraid, because he admits that he doesn't know, and that no one really seems to know why, or how to negate the fear.Moore's film is fascinating, but Moore dilutes his message, and reduces its meaning, by his own actions.  His interview (on the ""special"" second disc), with Charlie Rose is memorable, but the rest of the disc is Moore sounding off.  It seems that Moore can, for the most part, conduct himself appropriately to make sure his message is heard when he is filming, or when he is talking to someone of equal intellect.  Taken out of those parameters, he feels he has a bully pulpit for all of his views about what is wrong with America, whether they are germane to the film or not.  His sarcasm and seeming glee at the fact that he can say whatever he wants, truly reduce his effectiveness.With that said, ""B for C"" must be seen.  Try not to watch the second DVD.  While I preferred ""Roger and Me"", the poignancy of""B for C"" and the questions it raises (which will hopefully be followed by some solution-oriented actions by the nation) are memorable and provocative.A fine film, a fine effort.  Next time, Roger, don't make the second disc, and don't make speeches.

It's equal parts farce, propaganda, amateur speculation, and over-the-top public spectacle.  It's also a film that goes no where in particular, other than to cynically manipulate and poke fun of its targets in ways that embellish, but don't always support, Michael Moore's meandering, undisciplined commentary.And in the end, this film is about Michael Moore, more than anything else.  His hulking figure, and bitter persona, is the centerpiece.  If there was another thesis here, it was lost in all the rambling, in all the making sport of sad figures--like the aging, semi-incoherent Charlton Heston.The ostensible theme is that Americans are too violent, especially teens who think nothing about bloody school rampages.  Okay.  What does Mr. Moore think?  He's all over the place. For example, from long, intermittant stretches, one would think that the availability of weapons and ammunition are the cause.  After all, Moore makes a spectacle of getting K-Mart to stop selling bullets.  But then, he marshalls compelling evidence that countries with far greater weapon ownership and availability--like Canada--have far lower violent crime rates, particularly with firearms. (Okay, so what was the point of the K-Mart exercise?)

739400,A1IANEBSMVGHS9,B00008DDVU,"Manny Hernandez ""@askmanny""","[5, 12]","After attempting to read 'Stupid White Men' in its entirety, I was skeptical about watching 'Bowling for Columbine' to say the least. The former had made me think that Moore really didn't have much of a point, but the film, having just watched it, helped me gain respect for what he had to say. Plus, now that I see how extreme the reviews about the movie are (most of them being either 1 or 5 stars), I feel my gut confirmed that there's something important that he's trying to say, and I for one, want to listen to it.This documentary is long (some 2 hours) but it needs to be so: the issue presented has multiple dimensions and Moore is very effective in their presentation. Bringing back terrible memories from Columbine HS shooting and the killing of a 6-year old by a classmate in Flint, MI, Moore ponders once and again why (all other things being equal) would the US have such a high gunshot death rate, compared to all other first world nations. My first thought, when I saw the figures that he presented (US having 11,127 gunshot deaths in a year, compared to Japan's 39 or Canada's 165), was that he was not being fair, since he was leaving out the country's population. Well, taking the time to compute how many persons per million get shot to death in all the countries he compared the US against (consulting population figures in the CIA factbook online), it turns out that this number is 7.48 times higher in the US than its nearest 'gunshot death rate' neighbor (Canada) and a striking 127 times higher than Japan's 0.30 persons per million killed by a gun in a year's time. So his point is still clearly valid!&quot;All other things being equal&quot;, as I said before, is very broad, yet he tackled on most issues I can think of, when comparing the US with other countries in terms of possible causes for how violent we are: history of violence (think Germany and WWII, Britain and massacres in India), amount of guns owned (in Canada, almost 70% of the families own guns), violent movies or violent games (global broadcasting, display and sales of these make them available equally to audiences everywhere -indeed, the point can be made that a large number of violent video games come from Japan, where the issue is nowhere as critical), etc.(spoilers ahead, if you don't mind them)Granted that something is wrong when a 6-year old shoot another one in school, after discarding alternate hypothesis and interviewing people ranging from pro-gun control activists to NRA's very own Charlton Heston (no comment on him...) Moore comes to the conclusion (one that I particularly agree with) that we, as a society, are being bred in a culture of fear: the media feed us with the most absurd stories day in, day out, which put the fear in us, though some law enforcement officers argue that crime numbers have actually gone down, which results in an escalade of gun and bullet purchasing.

739404,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00008DDVU,Matthew Horner,"[3, 8]","Outspoken documentary filmmaker Michael Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine"" is both an outrageously funny and a profoundly sad look at gun violence in America. Our nation has the highest homicide by gun rate in the world, and Moore tackles this issue with his usual free-wheeling style. The movie has few answers to the questions it raises; indeed, Moore often seems perplexed by his subject matter.  That doesn't matter much because the movie stands as an invaluable documentation of a particular moment in our history. It also promotes debate on why we, citizens of the richest, most powerful nation on earth, seem hell-bent on shooting one another.As a kid growing up in Flint, Michigan, Moore learned to hunt with a rifle. He has been a member of the NRA for decades. I mention this to assure viewers who firmly believe that that all Americans have the right to own guns that Moore doesn't necessarily disagree. The message I got was that he, especially after the massacre at Columbine High School on April 20, 1999, now questions just how much we really need all these firearms. He demonstrates how television news today is geared to keeping us scared, despite the fact that crime has declined. He takes us to Canada where there are also lots of guns but where the murder rate is much lower. [Many Canadians don't even lock their doors!] He takes us to Japan and Great Britain where kids also grow up on violent movies and video games. Homicide rates in those countries are also exceedingly low.Some of the funniest scenes show Moore at a bank that offers a free gun for opening an account. Some of the most poignant involve two young men who were wounded at Columbine. They accompany Moore to the corporate headquarters of K-Mart, where they attempt to get refunds for the 17 cent bullets still lodged in their bodies. [The bullets used in the shootings were bought at a Denver K-Mart.]At times, Moore seems to be all over the map. I think this is because he trying to cover as many angles on the subject as he can. The result is one of the most fascinating documentaries ever made.

The film focuses not only upon the very tragic Columbine High School massacre in Colorado in 1999, but also upon many Americans' predilection for gun ownership and gun violence.  The film begins with an animated narrative about American history that begins to introduce the reasons that Michael Moore attributes to the very large amount of gun violence that exists within the U.S.  As Michael Moore thoughtfully points out, of all industrialized nations in the world today, the U.S. is the leader in the number of victims of gun violence with more than 11,000 deaths in 2001.  Conversely, Australia's number of gun violence victims for the same year was less than 40. (Several other nations' statistics are also shown, all much lower than the U.S., including neighboring Canada, France and England.)As Moore focuses on the two teenaged boys that committed the Columbine massacre, he points out the interesting coincidence that Moore grew up in Minnesota near where one of the boys had also lived for several years.  It was also the home to Charleton Heston, who is and has been the president of the National Rifle Association, as well as the location where the men who were convicted of being the 1995 Oklahoma City federal building bombers were involved with a local militia.  Moore interviews current militia members, John Nichols (brother of one the Oklahoma City bombers, Terry Nichols) and Charleton Heston.  He also interviews several of the Columbine massacre victims and Matt Stone, a former Columbine High School graduate, who is also one of the creators of the very popular animated TV series ""South Park"", which was modeled on the city of Columbine. Columbine's primary employer is Lockheed-Martin, which Michael Moore visits during the film.  Other interesting people that Moore interviews include rock-star Marilyn Manson and Dick Clark.  Moore also uses a lot of archive footage of various people and events.Michael Moore does present his case admirably for the causes of gun violence in the U.S. in ""Bowling for Columbine"", but sometimes his interviewing techniques are inappropriate and some of his information may be inaccurate.  Overall, however, because of the amount of information that Moore does provide that makes people think, I rate ""Bowling for Columbine"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  Not everyone who watches the documentary will agree with Michael Moore's conclusions or techniques, but the message about the amount of gun violence in the U.S. is something that cannot be ignored.  Hopefully, it will encourage adult gun owners to take all the necessary precautions for owning guns, and also encourage parents to make sure that they know what their children are doing, especially if the children have access to guns.",4,"""out in a little town in Colorado, two boys went bowling""",1078358400,"03 4, 2004",2004,2890,"['2002', 'outspoken', 'filmmaker', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'directed', 'wrote', 'produced', 'starred', 'controversial', 'documentary', 'entitled', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'very', 'tragic', 'Columbine', 'High', 'School', 'massacre', 'Colorado', '1999', 'also', 'many', 'Americans', 'predilection', 'gun', 'ownership', 'gun', 'violence', 'film', 'animated', 'narrative', 'American', 'history', 'introduce', 'reasons', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'very', 'large', 'amount', 'gun', 'violence', 'U.S.', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'thoughtfully', 'out', 'industrialized', 'nations', 'world', 'today', 'U.S.', 'leader', 'number', 'victims', 'gun', 'violence', 'more', '11,000', 'deaths', '2001', 'Conversely', 'Australia', 'number', 'gun', 'violence', 'victims', 'same', 'year', 'was', 'less', '40', 'Several', 'other', 'nations', 'statistics', 'are', 'also', 'shown', 'all', 'much', 'lower', 'U.S.', 'including', 'neighboring', 'Canada', 'France', 'England', 'Moore', 'two', 'teenaged', 'boys', 'committed', 'Columbine', 'massacre', 'out', 'interesting', 'coincidence', 'Moore', 'grew', 'up', 'Minnesota', 'where', 'one', 'boys', 'had', 'also', 'lived', 'several', 'years', 'was', 'also', 'home', 'Charleton', 'Heston', 'who', 'been', 'president', 'National', 'Rifle', 'Association', 'as', 'well', 'location', 'where', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'convicted', 'being', '1995', 'Oklahoma', 'City', 'federal', 'building', 'bombers', 'were', 'involved', 'local', 'militia', 'Moore', 'interviews', 'current', 'militia', 'members', 'John', 'Nichols', 'brother', 'one', 'Oklahoma', 'City', 'bombers', 'Terry', 'Nichols', 'Charleton', 'Heston', 'also', 'several', 'Columbine', 'massacre', 'victims', 'Matt', 'Stone', 'former', 'Columbine', 'High', 'School', 'graduate', 'who', 'also', 'one', 'creators', 'very', 'popular', 'animated', 'TV', 'series', 'South', 'Park', 'was', 'modeled', 'city', 'Columbine', 'Columbine', 'primary', 'employer', 'Lockheed-Martin', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'visits', 'film', 'Other', 'interesting', 'people', 'Moore', 'interviews', 'include', 'rock-star', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'Dick', 'Clark', 'Moore', 'also', 'lot', 'archive', 'footage', 'various', 'people', 'events.Michael', 'Moore', 'present', 'case', 'admirably', 'causes', 'gun', 'violence', 'U.S.', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'sometimes', 'interviewing', 'techniques', 'are', 'inappropriate', 'information', 'may', 'be', 'inaccurate', 'Overall', 'however', 'amount', 'information', 'Moore', 'provide', 'people', 'think', 'rate', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', '4', '5', 'stars', 'Not', 'everyone', 'who', 'documentary', 'will', 'agree', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'conclusions', 'techniques', 'message', 'amount', 'gun', 'violence', 'U.S.', 'something', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'ignored', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'encourage', 'adult', 'gun', 'owners', 'take', 'necessary', 'precautions', 'owning', 'guns', 'also', 'encourage', 'parents', 'make', 'sure', 'know', 'what', 'children', 'are', 'doing', 'especially', 'children', 'have', 'access', 'guns']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

Could it be that we listen to a lot of disturbing music?  Maybe it's because we're too in love with firearms.  Well, as the film goes on, we find out that all of the other countries love violent movies, disturbing music, and guns just as much as we do (even more so, in some cases).  Interesting questions are brought up that offer new points that rarely have been discussed before (like the impact of news programs).  We get more insight into the &quot;Columbine Massacre,&quot; and the impact guns can have on a child.  What we get is an interesting ride that is filled with humor and heart.Again, I'm no &quot;Michael Moore&quot; cheerleader; as I do not agree with him on everything he's said in the past.  However, I think he does a great job in his documentaries.  I even found &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; to be better than his first film, &quot;Roger &amp; Me.&quot;  You're not supposed to take everything that is said here to heart.  That's not what Moore wants at all.  The film's purpose is to bring up some different point of views and give us some very different questions that we have never encountered before.  In the end, it is YOU who decides what is going on and if you believe some of the things that are presented in this movie.The DVD is EXCELLENT when it comes to special features.  This 2-disk Special Edition includes extras like an exclusive interview with Michael Moore, commentary, Marilyn Manson's &quot;Fight Song&quot; music video, trailer, photo gallery, &quot;The Charlie Rose Show,&quot; and so much more.  The film looks and sounds great, as the budget and quality improved greatly with this one.&quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; isn't here to offer you solutions.  Nor is it here to make you think the way Michael Moore thinks and feels.  In the end, it is only a movie, and nothing more.  It's up to you to decide if it's going to have an impact on your life in some way or not.  Even if you don't like Moore or agree with the man on every single thing, it is still very much possible to enjoy this film.

739415,AMWSZ61FILX2J,B00008DDVU,Michael Erisman,"[6, 12]","This is a great documentary on the issue of gun control in the USA.  As a proponent of some sort of gun control, I think Moore nailed this aspect of the film by showing the widespread availability of hand guns and automatic weapons, and the gun culture that is America.  He begins with a hilarious bit about a bank that gives away a free gun when you open a checking account.  (What happened to toasters?).  His use of media images of military bombings, murders, and the infamous Columbine tragedy, highlight the need for some sort of control in this arena.  The depictions of media creating fear at every turn was excellent, as if we needed any more reasons to not trust everything the media throws our way as reality.However, the film quickly derails into often absurd and even embarrassing tangents.  Perhaps the most glaring of these illogical assertions is that somehow the ""work for welfare"" program in Michigan is at fault for a 6-year-old who kills a classmate with a loaded handgun brought from home.  The music played during this stretch was beyond an obvious attempt at some sort of victimhood celebration. His attempts to corner Dick Clark as a cause, because a restaurant that bears his name employs some welfare recipients, was a complete embarrassment to Moore and anyone who would buy into such tripe.  His attempts to play racism, and play to the victim mentality of the liberal left were sad and pathetic.  What started as a needed and apolitical message about violence is somehow now related to Moore's socialistic worldview?  He really lost me here.There are a few other interesting aspects he explored.  He takes two of the Columbine victims to the K-Mart headquarters to protest the fact that K-Mart sells bullets.  (The Chris Rock sketch on bullet control is worth the price of admission alone, and is a better solution.)  What Moore seems to forget is that his beloved Flint, Michigan's main manufacturing product was automobiles, which through misuse kill more people than all the bullets sold at all stores combined.  Would he protest one of those places?  Even more absurd is that fact that he states to Charlton Heston, leader of the NRA, that he Moore is in fact a member of the NRA!  Moore even shows him his membership card.  Then he proceeds to try and blame Heston for the killing of the 6-year-old?  Did anyone actually miss this blatant hypocrisy?Overall, this is typical Moore work.  His attempts to demonstrate the problem of gun use to kill others in our culture, as it compares to the rest of the free world, was excellent.  However, in the end, Moore offers no solutions, plays the victim aspect to the fullest, and leaves the viewer with nothing more than an inside look at his socialistic agenda. One gets the impression that Moore really has no idea how to solve these issues, nor what their cause is, beyond implementing a program of socialism or communism.  A wasted effort, which could have been a much-needed message on gun control.",3,"Great start, nails the gun control issue, then derails.",1062460800,"09 2, 2003",2003,2979,"['great', 'documentary', 'issue', 'gun', 'control', 'USA', 'proponent', 'sort', 'gun', 'control', 'think', 'Moore', 'nailed', 'aspect', 'film', 'showing', 'widespread', 'availability', 'hand', 'guns', 'automatic', 'weapons', 'gun', 'culture', 'America', 'hilarious', 'bit', 'bank', 'away', 'free', 'gun', 'when', 'open', 'checking', 'account', 'What', 'happened', 'toasters', 'use', 'media', 'images', 'military', 'bombings', 'murders', 'infamous', 'Columbine', 'tragedy', 'highlight', 'need', 'sort', 'control', 'arena', 'depictions', 'media', 'creating', 'fear', 'turn', 'was', 'excellent', 'needed', 'more', 'reasons', 'not', 'trust', 'everything', 'media', 'way', 'reality.However', 'film', 'quickly', 'often', 'absurd', 'even', 'embarrassing', 'tangents', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'glaring', 'illogical', 'assertions', 'somehow', 'work', 'welfare', 'program', 'Michigan', 'fault', '6-year-old', 'who', 'classmate', 'loaded', 'handgun', 'brought', 'home', 'music', 'played', 'stretch', 'was', 'obvious', 'attempt', 'sort', 'victimhood', 'celebration', 'attempts', 'corner', 'Dick', 'Clark', 'cause', 'restaurant', 'name', 'welfare', 'recipients', 'was', 'complete', 'embarrassment', 'Moore', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'buy', 'such', 'tripe', 'attempts', 'play', 'racism', 'play', 'victim', 'mentality', 'liberal', 'left', 'were', 'sad', 'pathetic', 'What', 'started', 'needed', 'apolitical', 'message', 'violence', 'somehow', 'now', 'related', 'Moore', 'socialistic', 'worldview', 'really', 'lost', 'are', 'few', 'other', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'explored', 'two', 'Columbine', 'victims', 'K-Mart', 'headquarters', 'protest', 'fact', 'K-Mart', 'bullets', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'sketch', 'bullet', 'control', 'price', 'admission', 'alone', 'better', 'solution', 'What', 'Moore', 'forget', 'beloved', 'Flint', 'Michigan', 'main', 'manufacturing', 'product', 'was', 'automobiles', 'misuse', 'kill', 'more', 'people', 'bullets', 'sold', 'stores', 'combined', 'Would', 'protest', 'one', 'places', 'Even', 'more', 'absurd', 'fact', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'leader', 'NRA', 'Moore', 'fact', 'member', 'NRA', 'Moore', 'even', 'membership', 'card', 'Then', 'try', 'blame', 'Heston', 'killing', '6-year-old', 'Did', 'anyone', 'actually', 'blatant', 'hypocrisy', 'Overall', 'typical', 'Moore', 'work', 'attempts', 'demonstrate', 'problem', 'gun', 'use', 'kill', 'others', 'culture', 'rest', 'free', 'world', 'was', 'excellent', 'However', 'end', 'Moore', 'solutions', 'victim', 'aspect', 'fullest', 'viewer', 'nothing', 'more', 'inside', 'look', 'socialistic', 'agenda', 'One', 'impression', 'Moore', 'really', 'idea', 'how', 'solve', 'issues', 'what', 'cause', 'implementing', 'program', 'socialism', 'communism', 'wasted', 'effort', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much-needed', 'message', 'gun', 'control']",Bowling For Columbine VHS
739416,AZI0O32W4ZYGH,B00008DDVU,"Michael Gordon ""Michael Gordon""","[5, 10]","Admittedly, in our society, there is nothing criminally wrong about being a hyper-leftist focused on advancing one's agenda.  Michael Moore, a college drop out, decided to create a film exploring the &quot;root&quot; causes of the Columbine disaster, which exploits to advance a political agenda he held before the crime occured.  The irony is that Michael Moore provides ample evidence a nation of &quot;gun nuts&quot; (his term, not mine) is not to blame for the Columbine disaster.  For instance, he admits that Canadians have lots of guns, and, considering their low murder rate, that is not to blame for the high murders in America.  Thus, it is a bit of irony that he tried to pick on Charlton Heston, president of the NRA, a man who was just trying to have a nice conversation with an apparent &quot;reporter.&quot;  Michael Moore's apparent conclusion as to why murder rates occur in the United States has to do with a lack of socialism--&quot;free health care&quot;--in the U.S.If Moore wanted to seriously consider the gun argument, he would have called John Lott Jr., author of &quot;More Guns, Less Crime.&quot;  He is an articulate spokesman for the notion that more guns will result in less crime due to the way criminals use incentives to control their behavior.Michael Moore also makes many irrelevant connections between items that have absolutely no connection to other items.  Lockheed Martin, a defense contractor, is apparently near the Columbine High School site.  So?  Moore brings up this connection without providing one single shred of evidence that one is connected to the other.  He thinks that by saying a defense contractor is near the school that it will result in one thinking that defense contractor sites encourage children to kill.  In fact, they do not.  If that were the case, we would at least see national statistics suggesting that such correlations exist.  I'm sure Michael Moore would be happy to show them.

Beusch,"[6, 13]","I'm getting sick and tired of gun nuts and right wingers bashing Michael Moore for allegedly being unfair to Charlton Heston during his interview for Bowling for Columbine. Hey conservatives! WATCH THE FILM!! I know it's the conservative mantra to condemn something they haven't viewed because (1) One of the conservative legends in their own minds like Bill O'Reilly or Rush Limbaugh told them what to think (as usual) or (2) Anything Michael Moore has to be, in their &quot;fair and balanced&quot; opinion, slanted, anti-American communist garbage.Some conservatives have accused Moore of exploiting Heston's Alzheimer condition. News flash, GOPer's! The interview was conducted before Heston revealed he had Alzheimer's disease. Unless Moore is paying off Heston's doctor to give him his medical history, there was no way he could have known about Heston's condition. The damaging quote from Heston is that America's racial diversity is at the root of all the gun violence in America. Moore did not manipulate Heston into saying that. He merely asked Heston, as spokesman of the NRA, what causes all the gun violence in America. Charlton Heston was the spokesman for the National Rifle Association. If he can't handle a simple question from Michael Moore without blaming racial diversity and essentially sticking his foot in his mouth, maybe the NRA should be looking for new leadership instead of calling a completely fair question from Michael Moore dirty pool.Right wingers love to wrap themselves in the flag and call someone that disagrees with them un-American. I believe strongly in the right to bear arms and keep guns in responsible households for self-protection, but the NRA is yet another right wing fringe nut group that hides behind the 2nd Amendment in order to forward their extremist policies. This, remember, is the organization that claimed that teflon coated &quot;cop killer&quot; bullets were a right and that porcelain guns that could be smuggled through metal detectors were protected under the 2nd Amendment (imagine how much more horrific the events of 9/11/01 might have been had our friends at the NRA had their way). Anyone who actually thinks that Michael Moore was being unfair to Charlton Heston in his interview just can't accept the fact that Heston leads a extremist group that can't possibly defend it's policy goals. Once again, the right wing whines about being picked upon when they really richly deserve every bit of criticism they've received.

If you treasure the cliche of ""if guns are made illegal, then only criminals will have guns"" then you might as lessen your likelihood of suffering a stroke and buy a ticket to the next Charlton Heston Film Festival.  But if it you seek a different viewpoint, one presented with wry and cynical humor, invest in this movie.  You won't be disappointed.Who ever thought that the far-right militias could provide such humor?  And how about the bank that doubles as a - fully licensed - gun distributor?  Michael Moore will never be accused of being too subtle, but he does provide a great amount of entertainment while expounding on his admittedly liberal bias.  When this film won the Academy Award for Best Documentary, he unabashedly used his 30 seconds of air time to propagate those views even further.The title of Bowling for Columbine refers to the two teenage killers who allegedly went bowling on the morning of their massacre at the Colorado high school.  Moore has been criticized by some for his use of video from a security camera at Columbine on that day, however I think that these images are presented with respect and in the proper context.Yes he does attempt a few ambush interviews, with mixed results.  Dick Clark basically drives away, K-Mart's public relations people provide a surprise and Charlton Heston manages to salvage some dignity while surrendering no ground whatsoever.  Other highlights include an examination of the different attitudes regarding guns as held by Americans and Canadians, the aforementioned bank with it's guns-as-giveaways promotion, and the Miss Militia calendar.Moore uses statistics that sometimes beg for more explanation and source accreditation, but then again few people or organizations with positions on gun ownership and legislation do.  Where Michael excels is in the areas of providing entertainment and raising questions.  He may not always provide satisfying answers, but he'll certainly make you think!",5,Give us more Michael!,1054512000,"06 2, 2003",2003,2156,"['not', 'dull', 'dry', 'discussion', 'regarding', 'issue', 'guns', 'gun', 'ownership', 'America', 'Moore', 'axe', 'grind', 'ammunition', 'load', 'style', 'own', 'treasure', 'cliche', 'guns', 'are', 'made', 'illegal', 'then', 'only', 'criminals', 'will', 'have', 'guns', 'then', 'might', 'lessen', 'likelihood', 'suffering', 'stroke', 'buy', 'ticket', 'next', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Film', 'Festival', 'seek', 'different', 'viewpoint', 'one', 'presented', 'wry', 'cynical', 'humor', 'invest', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.Who', 'ever', 'thought', 'far-right', 'militias', 'could', 'provide', 'such', 'humor', 'how', 'bank', 'fully', 'licensed', 'gun', 'distributor', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'accused', 'being', 'too', 'subtle', 'provide', 'great', 'amount', 'entertainment', 'expounding', 'admittedly', 'liberal', 'bias', 'When', 'film', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Documentary', 'unabashedly', 'used', '30', 'seconds', 'air', 'time', 'propagate', 'views', 'even', 'further.The', 'title', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'refers', 'two', 'teenage', 'killers', 'who', 'allegedly', 'went', 'bowling', 'morning', 'massacre', 'Colorado', 'high', 'school', 'Moore', 'been', 'criticized', 'use', 'video', 'security', 'camera', 'Columbine', 'day', 'however', 'think', 'images', 'are', 'presented', 'respect', 'proper', 'context.Yes', 'attempt', 'few', 'ambush', 'interviews', 'mixed', 'results', 'Dick', 'Clark', 'basically', 'away', 'K-Mart', 'public', 'relations', 'people', 'provide', 'surprise', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'salvage', 'dignity', 'surrendering', 'ground', 'whatsoever', 'Other', 'highlights', 'include', 'examination', 'different', 'attitudes', 'regarding', 'guns', 'held', 'Americans', 'Canadians', 'aforementioned', 'bank', 'guns-as-giveaways', 'promotion', 'Miss', 'Militia', 'calendar.Moore', 'statistics', 'sometimes', 'beg', 'more', 'explanation', 'source', 'accreditation', 'then', 'again', 'few', 'people', 'organizations', 'positions', 'gun', 'ownership', 'legislation', 'do', 'Where', 'Michael', 'excels', 'areas', 'providing', 'entertainment', 'raising', 'questions', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'provide', 'satisfying', 'answers', ""'ll"", 'certainly', 'make', 'think']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

That is why he received an oscar. That is why the oscars are such a joke now. He tells the one sided view that shows that guns by themselves, are the cause of most violence, instead of the misguided human beings that use them. He uses emotion, to highlight the tragedy of Columbine, but fails to point out the more than a dozen federal, state, and local laws broken by the two teenage killers that day, or if trained staff had been armed, might have help save lives. He does not stick to any facts, just molds certain events to play to his gun control myths. The interview with Charlton Heston (done with dishonesty and made to be a hit job) was a farce. If anyone cares to see the documented truth of how guns actually have saved lives in the right hands, go to [...] for the truth. I want facts on both sides of an issue, not emotional rhetoric.

I mean you have the controversy of Fahrenheight 9/11, the Oscar speech, etc...and he's even on Time magazine. The man knows how to stir controversy...and win it. This in case, meet his entrance into the main stage. With Roger and Me, he made his big shot name, then came 'Bowling for Columbine', the Oscar winning documentary about the NRA and violence in America.Not that I would agree on every point that Moore always makes, this film seems to be the one I'd agree with most. I've always felt the rising violence in our country is a mystery and he seems to be the Sherlock Holmes to investigate this. In thew film he traverses around the nation and even embarks outside, to Canada! There he meets people and we realize our situation is not that different than theirs, just the degree of intensity.The only problem to the entire documentary is that we are never really given the solid answer that we all look for in the film. But, in a way, that's fine. Why should we? Not one man should have the answer to all questions. In fact, I think it's fine enough that people will watch this and think...mainly that's Moore's objective.'Bowling for Columbine' is another copy and paste here and there, to understand the wear and tear of a certain subject. I don't see it too bad as say his recent film, '9/11', but it's quite apparent here. Oddly enough, I still agree with many points made.Throwing comedy to such a disturbing event is a hook. Just like writing music or a song, Moore composes a film that keeps you enticed...and you really enjoy it. Here I'm glad with the product. Can you name a film that's really made change, other than possibly 'JFK'? K-Mart stopped selling ammunition, can anyone disagree that this is a bad thing?

I had to hover over them to read what they said to decide whether I should go with three or four stars. Three stars means 'It's OK' and four stars means 'I like it', and sadly, I'm somewhere in the middle between the two. It was okay, and I liked some parts of it. When Moore approached Dick Clark, he didn't have an appointment, he 'ambushed' him outside of a hotel (I think), and expected him to answer questions about something that he personally probably had no knowledge of at all. While this 'might' make for great television/movies, it is really sort of poor journalistic integrity and made Dick Clark look really bad, when, in reality, had the man been given time to know what was going on before he was being asked questions with spotlights on him, he might have had a completely different response.The interview with Charlton Heston was bittersweet, especially to watch it now, so many years later.I really teared up and nearly cried when Kmart agreed to stop selling the bullets. It's not a political statement that made m choke up, but more the feeling that the two young men who were shot and were there talking to Kmart actually got to feel and see first hand that maybe they did something good. Whether you agree or disagree with what they were asking Kmart to do, you have to give credit to these two young men for standing up for themselves and for what they decided they believed in and DOING something about it. All young people should be commended for that, even if we don't necessarily agree with what they believe.All said and done, I am glad I finally watched this show and it wasn't too sensationalistic or over the top. However, there were some things about it I wish had been handled differently and that might have been taken more seriously if they had been. I personally think, like it or not, it was good that my teen son and I watched this together, and I did actually go look up and learn from my own research some things that this documentary mentioned. I think that's the best way to take any movies like this one: take them with a grain of salt and use them as a basis to perform your own research and draw your own conclusions.

Moore,"[7, 10]","I can be just as annoyed with Michael Moore as the next fellow--and not just because his name is similar to mine and he looks a little like me. He is far from immune to the common charges flung at him: manipulator, grandstander, camera hog, knee-jerk radical. Yet all of these accusations become irrelevant when he has a subject equal to his outrage and his caustic wit. ""Bowling for Columbine,"" an impassioned plea for gun control, may well be his finest, most outraged movie yet. Juxtaposing stock footage with modern-day interviews and running commentary, he roils the audience with shocked laughter, then plain old shock, and finally shocked mourning. Moore's great theme is the bottomless capacity of human beings to be both stupid and cruel, and in ""Bowling for Columbine,"" he uncovers abundant stupidity and cruelty. Worthies such as James Nichols (brother of Oklahoma City bomber Terry Nichols) hang themselves with their own rhapsodic paeans to their love of guns and fear of their fellow man. Moore has an incredible ability to get militia men, drug dealers, bomb throwers and their ilk to confess to their crimes on camera, as if they were talking about their day at the zoo. For Michael Moore, it's always a day at the zoo, and at the end of the movie he stalks particularly big game in the person of Charlton Heston, erstwhile superstar and current NRA president. As Moore grills Heston about the NRA's decision to hold a rally in Flint, Mich., just days after the shooting in Flint of six-year-old Kayla Rolland by her first-grade classmate, he deftly strips away Heston's brave facade to show the hollow man underneath. The Heston interview brings ""Bowling for Columbine"" to a particularly mournful close, as the audience--like Moore--is left wondering when the madness finally will stop.

739427,A2UL0A8GJB4318,B00008DDVU,mljkb,"[6, 15]","Michael Moore asks some serious questions.  Why does the United States have so many murders compared to other westernized, modern and developed countries?  Those countries don't have the poverty we do, they don't watch or play or listen to the violence we enjoy or other reasons shelved out to respond to the epidemic of gun violence in this country.  Moore takes all those arguements and effectively contradicts them with well-thought out counter-arguements.  He focuses on two infamous acts of gun violence: the Columbine shootings and the shooting of a six year-old girl by a class-mate that occurred in Flint, Michigan as examples.  It is extremely easy to get the guns used in these shootings and even easier to buy the ammo, Moore points out.  At K-Mart, one can buy ammo at any age with no i.d.  But the film does not focus the bulk of its time on Moores' inheritantly liberal standings (the film features a scathing cartoon that satires the history of white people in America, and Moore unfortunatly skewers a couple facts for more liberal effect), but far more on the issue at hand.  The Columbine shooting was done by two boys who played violent video games, listen to violence ridden music and watched violent t.v. and movies.  But Moore points out that many other developed countries watch the same movies, listen to the same music and play the same video games.  Japan, the global epicenter of violent video games has less than one hundred murders a year.  Many European countries watch the same movies and listen to the same music we do, but their combine murder rate for a year is serveral thousands less than America.  The Flint shooting was done by and African-American child.  But people of African heritage live all around the world.  Canada has the same percentage of African- American population that we do, but their murder rate is no more than a hundred a year.  So why does America have so many more murders that the rest of the developed, modern world (somewhere around an alarming 11,000, 11,000 a year)?  Without giving away too much, Moore hypothesises that the reasons are socital and the media.

739429,A1E15WYG9C47X1,B00008DDVU,"""mobby_uk""","[4, 8]","Michael Moore is a very brave man.Not since Bill Hicks did an American dare to speak out loud and directly about what he/she thinks is wrong with their society. While Hicks did it through his stand up routine, Moore is doing it through docu-films and books.After finding a comfortable niche on TV with TV Nation and The Awful Truth, Moore crowns the fruits of his more than decade labour with a docu-film, the core of which is about the tragedy of the Columbine High School massacre and the gun control debate that ensued long after,but is wider in scope to include the much more complex issue of finding or trying to explain the roots of the violence in US society.There are several points of interest in the film.The statistical comparison of the crime rate he made between the US and other developed country is something that baffled him and many of his interviewees, even Charleton Heston who was the cherry on Moore's cake (pardon the pun!),securing the interview that ends the film. I was really surprised by how little information and facts Heston has on the crime rate issue.I would have imagined the president of NRA would be more informed and learned about a debate that he has come across a zillion times,and not just repeating the same old diatribe and cliches!.Of course we get no answers, either from the Columbine tragedy, because the two kids responsible shot themselves and the reason they decided to commit their horrendeous act died with them, nor we get any answers about the roots of the wider crime problem.Gun ownership seems one, but then we get the impression that in Canada there are millions of guns out there, with a European crime rate.The emphasis on Canada in my opinion was a bit long, and the fact that Canadians do not lock their doors was over emphasized and a bit naive and unrepresentative of the core problem.Another very interesting angle in Moore's film, is the fearmongering he talks frequently about,the 1984-ish atmoshpere of fear mainly instigated by the media. While, there are  conspiracy undertones to his theory which I am not very comfortable with,it does present some valid points to ponder on.The political angle of the film is typical Moore.His anti Bush, anti American involvement in the foreign wars and the innocent lives that were lost as a result, is in my opinion something which he should be praised for, not because I agree with what he says or not, but simply because like Hicks he has the courage to highlight hypocrasies that many people know about but ignore.And to that end, no matter what the subject is ,it is stance and a rare courage that I applaud.I know a lot of people attack Moore for being unAmerican and unpatriotic for (as they say)trying to hang a dirty laundry that should remain buried especially to the rest of the world because the world out there does not need more ammunition to critisize/attack/hate America,a very sensitive area especially post 9/11. But I believe that Michael Moore is a true patriot.Patriotism is NOT about pride, but rather about love,care and concern for your country. Moore is concerned about the violence, the high rate of crime, the things that he alledges are done by the politicians in the name of the ordinary people, and this is where the source of his frustration  and the need to go out there and film it or write about it come from.The important issue about Moore is not whether you agree with him or not, it is rather about somebody who has a lot of interesting things to say in a democratic environment. Voltaire once said: I am against you till death in every word your say, but will defend till death your right of saying it.(roughly translated).So for those who think Moore makes sense, and is brave in saying what he says,it is good to know that there is actually someone speaking for many,and for those who think he is damaging his own country by what he says and believes in, then they should thank God for living in a democracy, when if a different opinion is voiced, it is not a sign of unpatriotism or dissent, but a platform for debate and exchange of ideas.So Bowling for Columbine is as a result a very important film.It not only discusses issues that you may or may not agree with, but it makes you think.This is what Bill Hicks strived to put across, and this is what Michael Moore is now doing.",5,The Truth is out There,1062720000,"09 5, 2003",2003,4327,"['Michael', 'Moore', 'very', 'brave', 'man.Not', 'Bill', 'Hicks', 'did', 'American', 'dare', 'speak', 'out', 'loud', 'directly', 'what', 'he/she', 'wrong', 'society', 'Hicks', 'did', 'stand', 'up', 'routine', 'Moore', 'doing', 'docu-films', 'books.After', 'finding', 'comfortable', 'niche', 'TV', 'TV', 'Nation', 'Awful', 'Truth', 'Moore', 'fruits', 'more', 'decade', 'labour', 'docu-film', 'core', 'tragedy', 'Columbine', 'High', 'School', 'massacre', 'gun', 'control', 'debate', 'ensued', 'long', 'wider', 'scope', 'include', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'issue', 'finding', 'trying', 'explain', 'roots', 'violence', 'US', 'are', 'several', 'points', 'interest', 'film.The', 'statistical', 'comparison', 'crime', 'rate', 'made', 'US', 'other', 'developed', 'country', 'something', 'baffled', 'many', 'interviewees', 'even', 'Charleton', 'Heston', 'who', 'was', 'cherry', 'Moore', 'cake', 'pun', 'securing', 'interview', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'how', 'little', 'information', 'Heston', 'crime', 'rate', 'issue.I', 'would', 'have', 'imagined', 'president', 'NRA', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'informed', 'learned', 'debate', 'come', 'zillion', 'times', 'not', 'just', 'repeating', 'same', 'old', 'diatribe', 'cliches', '.Of', 'course', 'get', 'answers', 'either', 'Columbine', 'tragedy', 'two', 'kids', 'responsible', 'shot', 'reason', 'decided', 'commit', 'horrendeous', 'act', 'died', 'get', 'answers', 'roots', 'wider', 'crime', 'problem.Gun', 'ownership', 'one', 'then', 'get', 'impression', 'Canada', 'are', 'millions', 'guns', 'there', 'European', 'crime', 'rate.The', 'emphasis', 'Canada', 'opinion', 'was', 'bit', 'long', 'fact', 'Canadians', 'do', 'not', 'lock', 'doors', 'was', 'emphasized', 'bit', 'naive', 'unrepresentative', 'core', 'problem.Another', 'very', 'interesting', 'angle', 'Moore', 'film', 'fearmongering', 'frequently', '1984-ish', 'atmoshpere', 'fear', 'mainly', 'instigated', 'media', 'are', 'conspiracy', 'undertones', 'theory', 'am', 'not', 'very', 'comfortable', 'present', 'valid', 'points', 'ponder', 'on.The', 'political', 'angle', 'film', 'typical', 'Moore.His', 'anti', 'Bush', 'anti', 'American', 'involvement', 'foreign', 'wars', 'innocent', 'lives', 'were', 'lost', 'result', 'opinion', 'something', 'should', 'be', 'praised', 'not', 'agree', 'what', 'not', 'simply', 'Hicks', 'courage', 'highlight', 'hypocrasies', 'many', 'people', 'know', 'ignore.And', 'end', 'matter', 'what', 'subject', 'stance', 'rare', 'courage', 'applaud.I', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'attack', 'Moore', 'being', 'unAmerican', 'unpatriotic', 'say', 'trying', 'hang', 'dirty', 'laundry', 'should', 'remain', 'buried', 'especially', 'rest', 'world', 'world', 'there', 'not', 'need', 'more', 'ammunition', 'critisize/attack/hate', 'America', 'very', 'sensitive', 'area', 'especially', 'post', '9/11', 'believe', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'true', 'patriot.Patriotism', 'NOT', 'pride', 'rather', 'love', 'care', 'concern', 'country', 'Moore', 'concerned', 'violence', 'high', 'rate', 'crime', 'things', 'are', 'done', 'politicians', 'name', 'ordinary', 'people', 'where', 'source', 'frustration', 'need', 'go', 'out', 'there', 'film', 'write', 'come', 'from.The', 'important', 'issue', 'Moore', 'not', 'agree', 'not', 'rather', 'somebody', 'who', 'lot', 'interesting', 'things', 'say', 'democratic', 'environment', 'Voltaire', 'once', 'said', 'am', 'till', 'death', 'word', 'say', 'will', 'defend', 'till', 'death', 'right', 'saying', 'roughly', 'translated', '.So', 'who', 'think', 'Moore', 'sense', 'brave', 'saying', 'what', 'good', 'know', 'actually', 'someone', 'speaking', 'many', 'who', 'think', 'damaging', 'own', 'country', 'what', 'then', 'should', 'thank', 'God', 'living', 'democracy', 'when', 'different', 'opinion', 'voiced', 'not', 'sign', 'unpatriotism', 'dissent', 'platform', 'debate', 'exchange', 'ideas.So', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'result', 'very', 'important', 'film.It', 'not', 'only', 'issues', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'agree', 'what', 'Bill', 'Hicks', 'strived', 'put', 'what', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'now', 'doing']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

But, he has the right to say what he feels.  And this was a movie about saying what you feel.This movie was about gun control in America and how it related to the Columbine tradgedy and the six year old school shooting in his hometown of Flint, MI.  We all scratch our heads and think ""why?"" when we hear of these terrible things, but he introduces us to these otherwise heavy topics with humor here and there.  The bank where he buys the gun, talking with the members of the Michigan Malicia (home of the Nichols brothers and Timothy McVeigh of the Oklahoma City bombing), asking the salesman of the home security system where exactly the rapist was now, and even Marilyn Manson!  Check out the special features section with the Marilyn Manson video ""Fight Song"" before a football team.  Now that's cool!  It very much as a horror aspect in very direct ways.  There is none of this old school horror / suspense mentality as it's a documentary rather than a movie.  There is no boggie man lurking in the shadows, these boys were real people.  Look at the video footage they took from the security cameras in the cafeteria and library from Columbine - one of them is blowing people away and drinking out of a pop bottle at the same time.The biggest question we all ask is ""Why?"".  Why did these two boys do what they did?  The answer?  Well, I guess there are no true answers.  Some atest it to the fact that it really REALLY sucks to be a teenager.  And even though I left my teens behind long ago, it really REALLY did suck.  Matt Stone of South Park creation summed it up pretty well when he talked about being tracked since the sixth grade to be in honors math class.  It is drilled into your head that if you don't get certain things in life you'll be a loser and die poor and lonely.  That's certainly not the case, as we would all find out, but it's hard to accept that while you're actually in bonehead math.I especially liked the scenes where he is chatting with two trashy young men in a bar who blame their hometown for all their problems, only to find out that they are the problem.  They were trash - selling drugs, guns, stolen property, etc.  And the other one said he was angry that he wasn't named as the #1 suspect in the making of an Anarchist Cookbook recipe, but this town was bringing him down so bad.  As we can see, the town is clearly to blame.That brings us to the state of the union address as his hometown of Flint.  Already depressed and downtroden over the auto industry decline, Flint also became the sight of the youngest school shooting in American history when a six year old boy brought a gun to school and shot a fellow first grader.  And Charlton Heston came to town to represent the NRA immediately following the Columbine as well as Flint tradgedies.  Now that's truly poor taste.  And he walked away from him.  He continued to walk away even when the audience was in tears when he said ""Mr. Heston, this is the girl who was shot in Flint"".  Michael Moore left her picture on his front porch and he too walked away.  Shame on Charlton Heston.  And shame on each and every one of us who is negligent.This is a movie with a message, and it touched each and every one of us somehow.

In it, Michael Moore tackles the potentially enormous and, ultimately unanswerable, question of why is there so much violence in America?  Focusing on the tragedy at Columbine as well as the shooting of a six year-old girl by one of her classmates in Flint, Michegan, near Moore's hometown, with an eye to global terrorism this is a powerful film.Surprisingly there's a lot of humour to be made from the humour, although admitedly much of this is lamentable, laughter being focused firmly on the ridiculous and absurd rather than anything Moore says himself.  He chooses his subjects carefully and lets them do the talking, and from a teenager who's upset that he didn't make No. 1 on a potential bomb-threat list at his high school to a hilarious cartoon take on the origins of violence in America, this will make you laugh out loud more than once.  Of course, much of the laughter may be slightly uneasy given not only the subject matter but also because much of it is of the kind where you will be gasping because you can't quite believe it.  Take for instance, the opening sequence where Moore opens up a bank account and receives a free gun with a background check that only appears to involve him ticking a few boxes.What came as a surprise to me though, although perhaps looking back at it this was naive, was how political this documentary is.  Several interesting points are made, backed up by admitedly blinkered statistics, but they are still shocking nonetheless.  Of particular note is Marilyn Manson's take on the matter, pointing his finger at world affairs rather than heavy metal music.  Understandably much of the film's appeal may well lay in to what extent you agree with Moore's political views.However, the main point is that these were genuinely tragic events that Moore finds himself unable to find a satisfactory explanation for, although he explores several avenues.  Such scenes as the security footage of Columbine at the time of the school shooting is some of the most horrendously affecting footage I've seen on film in a while.  The lasting impression seems to be one of despair rather than hope, and this more than anything else, perhaps explains the desperation and violence inherent in society we live in.",5,One of the best films of last year,1041292800,"12 31, 2002",2002,2348,"['Bowling', 'Columbine', 'may', 'be', 'documentary', 'certainly', 'way', 'top', '5', 'films', 'last', 'year', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'potentially', 'enormous', 'ultimately', 'unanswerable', 'question', 'why', 'there', 'so', 'much', 'violence', 'America', 'Focusing', 'tragedy', 'Columbine', 'as', 'well', 'shooting', 'six', 'year-old', 'girl', 'one', 'classmates', 'Flint', 'Michegan', 'Moore', 'hometown', 'eye', 'global', 'terrorism', 'powerful', 'film.Surprisingly', 'lot', 'humour', 'be', 'made', 'humour', 'admitedly', 'much', 'lamentable', 'laughter', 'being', 'focused', 'firmly', 'ridiculous', 'rather', 'anything', 'Moore', 'subjects', 'carefully', 'do', 'talking', 'teenager', 'who', 'upset', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'No', '1', 'potential', 'bomb-threat', 'list', 'high', 'school', 'hilarious', 'cartoon', 'take', 'origins', 'violence', 'America', 'will', 'make', 'loud', 'more', 'once', 'course', 'much', 'laughter', 'may', 'be', 'slightly', 'uneasy', 'given', 'not', 'only', 'subject', 'matter', 'also', 'much', 'kind', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'gasping', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'believe', 'Take', 'instance', 'opening', 'sequence', 'where', 'Moore', 'up', 'bank', 'account', 'free', 'gun', 'background', 'check', 'only', 'involve', 'ticking', 'few', 'boxes.What', 'came', 'surprise', 'perhaps', 'looking', 'back', 'was', 'naive', 'was', 'how', 'political', 'documentary', 'Several', 'interesting', 'points', 'are', 'made', 'backed', 'up', 'admitedly', 'blinkered', 'statistics', 'are', 'still', 'shocking', 'nonetheless', 'particular', 'note', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'take', 'matter', 'pointing', 'finger', 'world', 'affairs', 'rather', 'heavy', 'metal', 'music', 'Understandably', 'much', 'film', 'appeal', 'may', 'well', 'lay', 'what', 'extent', 'agree', 'Moore', 'political', 'views.However', 'main', 'point', 'were', 'genuinely', 'tragic', 'events', 'Moore', 'unable', 'find', 'satisfactory', 'explanation', 'several', 'avenues', 'Such', 'scenes', 'security', 'footage', 'Columbine', 'time', 'school', 'shooting', 'most', 'horrendously', 'affecting', 'footage', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'while', 'lasting', 'impression', 'be', 'one', 'despair', 'rather', 'hope', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'perhaps', 'desperation', 'violence', 'inherent', 'society', 'live']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

The film/documentary basically puts forward the question - are Americans nuts about guns, or just plain nuts? Moore's film would point to the latter, and it's not without its reasons. America has by far the highest toll of gun deaths for a Western country per year, 11,000+ as the documentary explains compared to the few hundred by the next highest ranking country. The average viewer would quickly come to the conclusion that it is because America has so many guns, but this view is challenged when Moore points out that Canada has seven million guns in ten million families, but ""only"" a few hundred deaths each year.'Bowling for Columbine' focuses on the 1999 Columbine school shootings and the death of a six year old girl to form the basis of the documentary's questions. He also takes a look at the culture of fear that has been created by the American media and its victimisation of African Americans. Two of the documentary's highlights are the acts of America's foreign policy, played ironically to Satchmo's 'What a Wonderful World', and a cartoon explaining the brief history of the USA, which while simplistic, is certainly funny. And not to be forgotten, of course, is the interview with Charlton Heston. Moore lays into him like a ton of bricks and ends up making Heston look like what he is - a gun toting, far right fanatic with no moral basis for his beliefs. Well done Moore for exposing this!One slight drawback of the documentary I felt, was how Moore seemed to present America as a land where guns rule and killings occur throughout it, but having been to America and having many friends who are American, I know for a fact this is not true. It obviously varies from place to place, which Moore didn't seem to explain.As many critics have claimed, the low point of the documentary is Moore's failure to come up with an answer to his question. This is true, but I think the words of a review I recently read in the newspaper sums it up well - ""While Moore may not provide any conclusive answers to the questions he poses, in a world where people are too afraid to question anything, at least he's asking them"".As the for the question Moore posed, that being why America has so many gun deaths compared to other western countries, I have come up with a view, which may or may not be correct. Ever since the Pilgrims arrived in America in the sixteenth century, Americans have constantly moved west to find new land. Because of this, they moved so quickly that often they had no governing body to restrict their actions, so people took matters into their own hands. Could these periods of lawlessness have created such a society?",5,"Hilarious, Alarming, Sad, Thought Provoking, Everything!",1053907200,"05 26, 2003",2003,2939,"['More', 'compelling', 'nearly', 'other', 'film', 'past', 'few', 'years', ""'Bowling"", 'Columbine', 'had', 'wondering', 'why', 'are', ""n't"", 'more', 'documentary', 'general', 'release', 'cinemas', 'left', 'cinema', 'feeling', 'not', 'only', 'entertained', 'more', 'thought', 'provoked', 'have', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'film/documentary', 'basically', 'forward', 'question', 'are', 'Americans', 'nuts', 'guns', 'just', 'plain', 'nuts', 'Moore', 'film', 'would', 'point', 'latter', 'not', 'reasons', 'America', 'far', 'highest', 'toll', 'gun', 'deaths', 'Western', 'country', 'year', '11,000+', 'documentary', 'explains', 'compared', 'few', 'hundred', 'next', 'highest', 'ranking', 'country', 'average', 'viewer', 'would', 'quickly', 'come', 'conclusion', 'America', 'so', 'many', 'guns', 'view', 'challenged', 'when', 'Moore', 'out', 'Canada', 'seven', 'million', 'guns', 'ten', 'million', 'families', 'only', 'few', 'hundred', 'deaths', 'year', ""'Bowling"", 'Columbine', 'focuses', '1999', 'Columbine', 'school', 'shootings', 'death', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'form', 'basis', 'documentary', 'questions', 'also', 'look', 'culture', 'fear', 'been', 'created', 'American', 'media', 'victimisation', 'African', 'Americans', 'Two', 'documentary', 'highlights', 'are', 'acts', 'America', 'foreign', 'policy', 'played', 'ironically', 'Satchmo', ""'What"", 'Wonderful', 'World', 'cartoon', 'explaining', 'brief', 'history', 'USA', 'simplistic', 'certainly', 'funny', 'not', 'be', 'forgotten', 'course', 'interview', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Moore', 'ton', 'bricks', 'up', 'making', 'Heston', 'look', 'what', 'gun', 'toting', 'far', 'right', 'fanatic', 'moral', 'basis', 'beliefs', 'Well', 'done', 'Moore', 'exposing', 'One', 'slight', 'drawback', 'documentary', 'felt', 'was', 'how', 'Moore', 'seemed', 'present', 'America', 'land', 'where', 'guns', 'rule', 'killings', 'occur', 'having', 'been', 'America', 'having', 'many', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'American', 'know', 'fact', 'not', 'true', 'obviously', 'place', 'place', 'Moore', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'explain.As', 'many', 'critics', 'have', 'claimed', 'low', 'point', 'documentary', 'Moore', 'failure', 'come', 'up', 'answer', 'question', 'true', 'think', 'words', 'review', 'recently', 'read', 'newspaper', 'sums', 'up', 'well', 'Moore', 'may', 'not', 'provide', 'conclusive', 'answers', 'questions', 'world', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'too', 'afraid', 'question', 'anything', 'least', 'asking', 'question', 'Moore', 'posed', 'being', 'why', 'America', 'so', 'many', 'gun', 'deaths', 'compared', 'other', 'western', 'countries', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'view', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'correct', 'Ever', 'Pilgrims', 'arrived', 'America', 'sixteenth', 'century', 'Americans', 'have', 'constantly', 'moved', 'west', 'find', 'new', 'land', 'moved', 'so', 'quickly', 'often', 'had', 'governing', 'body', 'restrict', 'actions', 'people', 'took', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'Could', 'periods', 'lawlessness', 'have', 'created', 'society']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

Hardy ""GH""","[9, 19]","Having seen this at the cinema twice, and being a proud owner of my own copy on DVD (I live in the UK, it's been out here for a few weeks) I can understand why this documentary won it's award at the Cannes Film Festival in 2002.The focus is primarily about gun ownership, fear culture, and some history of gun laws, in the USA. Columbine High School is used as one of the illustrative examples of how and why the current legislation is not a good thing.Some coverage is provided about the culture surrounding gun ownership, and the culture of fear that seems prevelant in american media over recent years. As a regular viewer of american news services (thank-you digital tv :-), I can attest to the accuracy of this coverage in comparison to that provided in europe. Michael Moore provides his own comparison - to media coverage of events in Canada. Also, some interesting insights from Marilyn Manson (who rose considerably in my estimation), which seemed especially relevant as we sat on the cusp of Gulf War 2.Something which was clear to me from Moore's attempts to speak to someone senior in K-Mart, was that without making a fuss, and turning up without an attending media circus, no-one seemed particularly interested in listening to him and the students he was with. It seemed that only when revenue was potentially affected by bad press, was anyone prepared to take any form of action at all.The closing interview with Charlton Heston, and indeed some of his actions as president of the NRA, leaves one wondering how people of this ilk can sleep at night. Perhaps it's the loaded weapon under the pillow that does it for them, which I find as disturbing as some of the other images presented liberally throughout the documentary.I speculate that there are those in the USA who will not take well to this. However, I felt that the documentary was well thought through, and presented a good case for attempting to remove guns from the population at large. It may also help a few people consider how some of us in europe view the USA.There's a lot more I could say about this, but you really are better seeing this for yourself. There's plenty in there to make you laugh, but there's even more that you'll watch from behind your hands in disbelief. You can be laughing one minute, and very misty eyed the next.

739438,A1S5B32WYMEE44,B00008DDVU,"M. Swinney ""Marc My Words""","[2, 5]","Michael Moore is indeed a controversial character these days.  Despite your individual political bent, Moore's &quot;Bowling for Columbine,&quot; is worth viewing, but when you go to feast on the anti-violence in America message, just be careful how much you swallow.In this documentary Moore couches his message in a &quot;just under the surface&quot; manipulative way.  I watched his first flick, &quot;Roger and Me,&quot; and didn't walk away from it feeling that the message had been forcefully presented like in &quot;Bowling for Columbine.&quot;  Though it has no bearing on the worthiness of this product, I would say I am in agreement with the message Moore is trying to convey here...America has proved itself a somewhat unhealthy violent society...and something needs to be done about our fascination and seemingly personal constitution claim to the holy grail of gun ownership.  However where I'm lost with Moore is the way he presents the message, heavy-handed and served up.Here's what I mean.  Moore makes it a point to say that Columbine happened at the same time America was dropping the single-most amount of bombs on Kosovo.  He does this with footage of a KC-135...a non-bomb dropping refueler that is also utilized at times to carry humanitarian supplies.  I appreciate his saying that our willingness to wage war as a nation may translate in cases to personal violence, however the connection is tenuous at best.  War can be a regrettably necessary act.  Not many people would argue against the necessity of war in 1941 or in 1945.  Mahatmas Ghandi and India waged war (albeit non-violent) against Great Britain to end that occupation.  So, I feel Moore has mixed his messages of anti-war with anti-cultural violence and gun control.Another heavy-handed approach is Moore's harassment of Charlton Heston, the figure-head of the NRA, who Moore quixotically enough is still a card-carrying member.  I disagree with the amount of power the NRA holds and agree with Moore that they are foolishly advocating for laws and rules that beget ease to obtain guns, but Moore's approach leaves even the more cool-headed liberals feeling somewhat sorry for Heston.  I don't think that was Moore's intent, but he has a history for confronting people in influential positions and making them look foolish.The scenes of Columbine are indeed hard to watch.  It's funny that there is a thought through approach in directing and editing this film, that uses graphic images of violence and gun-killings to portray an anti-violent and anti-gun message.  England had a school shooting in the late 90's and enacted restrictive gun laws quickly and efficiently.  America could not even vote in a pro-gun control president in 2000 in the wake of repeated cases of school violence.Moore's message needs to be heard.  There's a problem and something needs to be done about it.  But I question, his somewhat manipulated approach to conveying that message.  By all means, watch &quot;Bowling for Columbine,&quot; but be wary of what you swallow as truth.",3,A Version of Violence,1073174400,"01 4, 2004",2004,3046,"['Michael', 'Moore', 'indeed', 'controversial', 'character', 'days', 'individual', 'political', 'bent', 'Moore', 'quot', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'quot', 'viewing', 'when', 'go', 'feast', 'anti-violence', 'America', 'message', 'just', 'be', 'careful', 'how', 'much', 'swallow.In', 'documentary', 'Moore', 'message', 'quot', 'just', 'surface', 'quot', 'manipulative', 'way', 'watched', 'first', 'flick', 'quot', 'Roger', 'Me', 'quot', 'did', ""n't"", 'walk', 'away', 'feeling', 'message', 'had', 'been', 'forcefully', 'presented', 'quot', 'Bowling', 'Columbine.', 'quot', 'bearing', 'worthiness', 'product', 'would', 'say', 'am', 'agreement', 'message', 'Moore', 'trying', 'convey', 'here', 'America', 'proved', 'somewhat', 'unhealthy', 'violent', 'society', 'something', 'needs', 'be', 'done', 'fascination', 'seemingly', 'personal', 'constitution', 'claim', 'holy', 'grail', 'gun', 'ownership', 'However', 'where', ""'m"", 'lost', 'Moore', 'way', 'message', 'heavy-handed', 'served', 'what', 'mean', 'Moore', 'point', 'say', 'Columbine', 'happened', 'same', 'time', 'America', 'was', 'dropping', 'single-most', 'amount', 'bombs', 'Kosovo', 'footage', 'KC-135', 'non-bomb', 'dropping', 'refueler', 'also', 'utilized', 'times', 'carry', 'humanitarian', 'supplies', 'appreciate', 'saying', 'willingness', 'wage', 'war', 'nation', 'may', 'translate', 'cases', 'personal', 'violence', 'however', 'connection', 'tenuous', 'best', 'War', 'can', 'be', 'regrettably', 'necessary', 'act', 'Not', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'argue', 'necessity', 'war', '1941', '1945', 'Mahatmas', 'Ghandi', 'India', 'waged', 'war', 'non-violent', 'Great', 'Britain', 'end', 'occupation', 'So', 'feel', 'Moore', 'mixed', 'messages', 'anti-war', 'anti-cultural', 'violence', 'gun', 'control.Another', 'heavy-handed', 'approach', 'Moore', 'harassment', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'figure-head', 'NRA', 'who', 'Moore', 'quixotically', 'enough', 'still', 'card-carrying', 'member', 'disagree', 'amount', 'power', 'NRA', 'agree', 'Moore', 'are', 'foolishly', 'advocating', 'laws', 'rules', 'beget', 'ease', 'obtain', 'guns', 'Moore', 'approach', 'even', 'more', 'cool-headed', 'liberals', 'feeling', 'somewhat', 'sorry', 'Heston', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'Moore', 'intent', 'history', 'confronting', 'people', 'influential', 'positions', 'making', 'look', 'foolish.The', 'scenes', 'Columbine', 'are', 'indeed', 'hard', 'watch', 'funny', 'thought', 'approach', 'directing', 'editing', 'film', 'graphic', 'images', 'violence', 'gun-killings', 'portray', 'anti-violent', 'anti-gun', 'message', 'England', 'had', 'school', 'shooting', 'late', '90', 'enacted', 'restrictive', 'gun', 'laws', 'quickly', 'efficiently', 'America', 'could', 'not', 'even', 'vote', 'pro-gun', 'control', 'president', '2000', 'wake', 'repeated', 'cases', 'school', 'violence.Moore', 'message', 'be', 'heard', 'problem', 'something', 'needs', 'be', 'done', 'question', 'somewhat', 'manipulated', 'approach', 'conveying', 'message', 'means', 'watch', 'quot', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'quot', 'be', 'wary', 'what', 'swallow', 'truth']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

At times, it's hilarious, it's well edited to maximize humor and shock value, and it addresses a vast number of issues important to the American landscape in the 21st century.That being said, it isn't really a documentary. Webster's defines the term 'documentary' as ""presenting facts objectively without editorializing or inserting fictional matter, as in a book or film."" The problem with this film is that it does editorialize, since Moore himself is more the star of the movie than the people and events he is documenting. I happen to agree with much of what Moore is trying to convey, his stance on gun control, the culture of fear in America, the relatively low gun murder rates in other countries. But the way it is portrayed is so one-sided, that it is almost offensive as a viewer to watch such a subjective presentation of what is really a pretty sound argument. What becomes clear by the end of the movie is that the film is less a tribute to the victims of the Columbine tragedy, and more a launching pad for Moore's political agenda. Don't get me wrong, I found the film tremendously entertaining, but also a little insincere.Also, Bowling for Columbine addresses almost too many different issues. From gun control, welfare reform, terrorism, American foreign policy, the NRA, the KKK, gang violence, Marilyn Manson and many other issues, Moore opens up so many cans of worms that one almost forgets what the film is about in the first place. Sure, each of these things are supposed to be linked to gun violence in America, but we never really find out how.

As someone who has grown up thirty minutes from Moore's hometown of Flint, I have always had an affinity with Michael Moore's work, but Bowling for Columbine strikes me as far superior to anything this director has done before.Bowling for Columbine, though it definitely has an agenda, strikes me as being more even-handed than Moore's previous film and television work. I loved Roger & Me, but Bowling for Columbine is so much broader in its scope and reasoned in its execution.Moore does not, as some have suggested, slam or use the ""tactics of guerrilla journalism"" on the people who come off looking really bad (James Nichols, Lockheed Martin, Charleton Heston) in this film. He hands them the rope of his questions and lets them hang themselves with their own words and actions.Bowling for Columbine's simple documentation speaks more eloquently about the state of American politics than the hundreds of schills and pundits on the evening news. In Bowling for Columbine one can visibly see America's descent from freedom and liberty into a state of fear and despair.As much as I love my home state (Michigan--which comes off very poorly in this film) and my country, Bowling for Columbine makes one thing crystal clear: it is time for a change. The politics of hope and reason must win the day against George Bush and the politics of fear and death.I give Bowling for Columbine a FULL five stars.",5,It is time,1062979200,"09 8, 2003",2003,1503,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'one', 'most', 'engaging', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'someone', 'who', 'grown', 'up', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'Moore', 'hometown', 'Flint', 'have', 'always', 'had', 'affinity', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'work', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'strikes', 'far', 'superior', 'anything', 'director', 'done', 'before.Bowling', 'Columbine', 'definitely', 'agenda', 'strikes', 'being', 'more', 'even-handed', 'Moore', 'previous', 'film', 'television', 'work', 'loved', 'Roger', 'Me', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'so', 'much', 'broader', 'scope', 'reasoned', 'execution.Moore', 'not', 'have', 'suggested', 'slam', 'use', 'tactics', 'guerrilla', 'journalism', 'people', 'who', 'come', 'off', 'looking', 'really', 'bad', 'James', 'Nichols', 'Lockheed', 'Martin', 'Charleton', 'Heston', 'film', 'rope', 'questions', 'hang', 'own', 'words', 'actions.Bowling', 'Columbine', 'simple', 'documentation', 'speaks', 'more', 'eloquently', 'state', 'American', 'politics', 'hundreds', 'schills', 'pundits', 'evening', 'news', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'one', 'can', 'visibly', 'see', 'America', 'descent', 'freedom', 'liberty', 'state', 'fear', 'despair.As', 'much', 'love', 'home', 'state', 'Michigan', 'off', 'very', 'poorly', 'film', 'country', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'one', 'thing', 'crystal', 'clear', 'time', 'change', 'politics', 'hope', 'reason', 'must', 'win', 'day', 'George', 'Bush', 'politics', 'fear', 'death.I', 'give', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'FULL', 'five', 'stars']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[4, 7]","Michael Moore has probably earned more than a few haters after his Oscar rant against Bush, and it's easy to find backlash against this film online.Overall, I found this a pretty good documentary.  For one, like most of Moore's work, it's very entertaining.However, like most of Moore's work, it's also bombastic and a bit much at times, and this deluxe 2 DVD set is more Moore than I could handle at times.Moore is a leftist who has regularly cries out against both parties (or the one big party in America) and encourages radical change over partisan games.  He can come off as somewhat of a blowhard, and very into himself.  But there are few people making films like his, and I think it's good that a movie like this managed to reach a wide audience.Bowling for Columbine takes the infamous school shooting as a take-off point about the love of violence in America and its link to gun availability and gun culture.  Moore himself is an NRA member since his youth, familiar with firearms and shooting, so it's not guns per se that bother him.  His tone is often one of general curiousity over the seeming obsession with guns in America, and the violence that exists everywherefrom the classroom to the battlefields overseas.  His journey takes him to Littleton, Colorado, where he admits what struck him most was how normal it appeared, like any other suberb in America.  So what would make two teens go ballistic one dayand kill fellow students, after going bowling of all things in the morning.Moore works a number of angles, including the proximity of military installations to the area, or factories where military-industrial materials are produced.  He interviews a number of people drawn into the circle of fire after Columbine including Charlton Heston and Marilyn Manson.  Thankfully, Moore is not convinced by the typical argument that violent movies, violent television, violent video games and angry music would cause two suburban teens to shoot up their school.  Nor is it Marilyn Manson, who was cited as the cause of all of this, an absurd assertion made all the more laughable by shots of Joe Lieberman denouncing the artist and his group as 'the sickest rock group ever'.  Joe, get back to Earth.I had a problem with some of the presentation.  He condemns Charlton Heston for hosting an NRA rally near Columbine shortly after the shootings, fine.  But the rally certainly appeared popular, if distasteful.  Charlton Heston is not the problem.Moore shows up at Heston's house at the end and interviews him.  It's clear Heston is trying to be somewhat accomodating, but is then thrown some questions he can't possibly answer, and the end result is he looks like a fool.  The sequence ends withMoore haranguing the man in his own house, somehow drawing a link between a child killed many miles away with a gun and Charlton Heston's spokemanship for the NRA.  Why would he pick on Heston and not Manson?  Neither is responsible, and both try and give honest opinions.  Manson actually comes off as one of the most articulate of the interviewees, go figure.Also, some of the statistics that are flashed on the screen and some of the assertions and facts are a bit skewed, if only to get a reaction, which is Moore's point.Still, it's a good documentary.  Thought-provoking,entertaining, and somewhat sincere.  At least someone is trying to make films like this. The DVD is packed with features, which will entice those with interest.",3,More Moore than some can handle,1083801600,"05 6, 2004",2004,3447,"['Michael', 'Moore', 'probably', 'earned', 'more', 'few', 'haters', 'Oscar', 'rant', 'Bush', 'easy', 'find', 'backlash', 'film', 'online.Overall', 'found', 'pretty', 'good', 'documentary', 'one', 'most', 'Moore', 'work', 'very', 'entertaining.However', 'most', 'Moore', 'work', 'also', 'bombastic', 'bit', 'much', 'times', 'deluxe', '2', 'DVD', 'set', 'more', 'Moore', 'could', 'handle', 'times.Moore', 'leftist', 'who', 'regularly', 'cries', 'out', 'parties', 'one', 'big', 'party', 'America', 'radical', 'change', 'partisan', 'games', 'can', 'come', 'off', 'somewhat', 'blowhard', 'very', 'are', 'few', 'people', 'making', 'films', 'think', 'good', 'movie', 'managed', 'reach', 'wide', 'audience.Bowling', 'Columbine', 'infamous', 'school', 'shooting', 'take-off', 'point', 'love', 'violence', 'America', 'link', 'gun', 'availability', 'gun', 'culture', 'Moore', 'NRA', 'member', 'youth', 'familiar', 'firearms', 'shooting', 'not', 'guns', 'se', 'tone', 'often', 'one', 'general', 'curiousity', 'seeming', 'obsession', 'guns', 'America', 'violence', 'classroom', 'battlefields', 'overseas', 'journey', 'Littleton', 'Colorado', 'where', 'what', 'struck', 'most', 'was', 'how', 'normal', 'appeared', 'other', 'suberb', 'America', 'what', 'would', 'make', 'two', 'teens', 'go', 'ballistic', 'one', 'dayand', 'kill', 'fellow', 'students', 'going', 'bowling', 'things', 'morning.Moore', 'number', 'angles', 'including', 'proximity', 'military', 'installations', 'area', 'factories', 'where', 'military-industrial', 'materials', 'are', 'produced', 'number', 'people', 'drawn', 'circle', 'fire', 'Columbine', 'including', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'Thankfully', 'Moore', 'not', 'convinced', 'typical', 'argument', 'violent', 'movies', 'violent', 'television', 'violent', 'video', 'games', 'angry', 'music', 'would', 'cause', 'two', 'suburban', 'teens', 'shoot', 'up', 'school', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'who', 'was', 'cited', 'cause', 'absurd', 'assertion', 'made', 'more', 'laughable', 'shots', 'Joe', 'Lieberman', 'denouncing', 'artist', 'group', ""'the"", 'sickest', 'rock', 'group', 'ever', 'Joe', 'get', 'back', 'Earth.I', 'had', 'problem', 'presentation', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'hosting', 'NRA', 'rally', 'Columbine', 'shortly', 'shootings', 'fine', 'rally', 'certainly', 'appeared', 'popular', 'distasteful', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'not', 'problem.Moore', 'up', 'Heston', 'house', 'end', 'interviews', 'clear', 'Heston', 'trying', 'be', 'somewhat', 'accomodating', 'then', 'thrown', 'questions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'answer', 'end', 'result', 'fool', 'sequence', 'withMoore', 'haranguing', 'man', 'own', 'house', 'somehow', 'drawing', 'link', 'child', 'killed', 'many', 'miles', 'away', 'gun', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'spokemanship', 'NRA', 'Why', 'would', 'pick', 'Heston', 'not', 'Manson', 'responsible', 'try', 'give', 'honest', 'opinions', 'Manson', 'actually', 'off', 'one', 'most', 'articulate', 'interviewees', 'go', 'figure.Also', 'statistics', 'are', 'flashed', 'screen', 'assertions', 'facts', 'are', 'bit', 'skewed', 'only', 'get', 'reaction', 'Moore', 'point.Still', 'good', 'documentary', 'Thought-provoking', 'entertaining', 'somewhat', 'sincere', 'least', 'someone', 'trying', 'make', 'films', 'DVD', 'packed', 'features', 'will', 'entice', 'interest']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

739452,ANP3R2R4V4GAN,B00008DDVU,Omni,"[16, 23]","What makes this film so remarkable is the truth that it ultimately tells. Simplisticly he traces the rampant gun mania in this country back to the origins of this country being on genocide and slavery. I'd seen Moore talk about his film on Oprah at length before I saw this film, as well as the three minute cartoon that traces the US history and shows the paranoia that white people have been engendered with.A film that focuses on gun control becomes about race and racism. The racial portrayal of people of color in the media, the media eagerly showing particular races ad nauseum commiting crimes, over and over and over, forcing white people to believe their engendered fears about other races. The audience laughed at all the appropriate parts until it became about race, then only the people of color laughed because of the bitter truth of the entire situation. White people are afraid to admit this truth, this fear, this internalized terror that seems to stalk so many to the point of getting as many guns as possible.Charlton Heston, spokesman for the NRA, is interviewed in the film and even he admits that part of the problem, the crime is because of so many ethnicities in this country.White people are so afraid. Afraid because America is a Me culture, unlike other countries that have socialized medicine, socialized care for the elderly, and at some level while it affords immediate gratification, we all understand that isn't right.I don't know how to make White people less scared, to get a population of 280 million to relinquish having 250 million guns or 750 million televisions which honestly is becoming a manifestation of what we all project as ""the Devil"". We're slowly imploding into consumerism, a mentality of attack, attack, attack with a focus on war and destruction and killing each other. Frankly, after leaving the movie, I was ashamed that I lived in a country where our children can turn not only physically, whether purposefully as in Columbine or in Flint, accidentally, to killing. Children are killing. What else do we need as a wake up call?I took a class man years ago taught by an Indian chief and his lesson was that every culture has armageddon mythology but that American Indian mythology includes that the winds will be out of control, that our weather patterns will no longer make sense and the next that our children will kill. I do believe that the focus of television and video games and movies teaches children HOW to kill and destroy but it is America's lack of emapthy and compassion that teaches them WHY to kill.When so many people Moore interviewed were asked why they were arming themselves, they came back to the 2nd Amendment, to the necessity to protect themselves, their families, to the fear of the THEM coming for them whether it be government or SOMEONE, colored ultimately and I thought to myself what people of color are taught from a young age: White people are crazy, and now there's a film to support that theory.Statistically it bears out that Black peopel have actually committed less crime in teh past 10 years than White people, 30% lowering while there has been a 600% increase in teh showing of black men as criminals on TV. Amazingly companies like Enron and World Com that financially rape millions of people of their entire lives are shown briefly before we get back to the projected terrorists and racial dangers here in America. White citizens born into fear and constantly propogandized by television about fearing are arming themselves and ironically as we learned in Columbine, killing themselves. White children go hog wild with guns, white men are more apt to commit suicide and take the family with them, white peopel wage war without the UN support and teh rest of us sit and watch.I've been to Canada and honestly the White people there are different, maybe it's more space, maybe it's because they are a country committed to caring about people, not just thru lip service but through social and financial commitment---free medical care for EVERYONE, care for the elderly, a higher unemployment rate but a giv't committed to employing it's citizens. A mass of 30 million people who have 7 million guys and less than 200 gun shootings a year. America, 280 million has close to 12,000 gun murders a year. Even by the simplistic math of avering 10 times more in population we should only have 2000 average gun related shootings a year and yet we have 6 times THAT amount.America is hemorraging from lack of social care for EVERYONE, rich or poor, lack of parental classes, lack of marital classes, lack of integrity, lack of responsible election processes, lack of big business regulation and lack of respect for the world. Its funny how this film correlates the ideology into the political system, but like a disease this is rampant to the very concept of the 3 card monte deal of hunting for Osama to blaming Saddam Hussein for the world's teroristic problems. Bush knows how many weapons of mass destruction are in Iraq, why?> because his daddy sold them to Iraq when Hussein was helped to established power by the US to oppose Iran. We didn't care about the actions of teh regime then, it was only when oil prices went up that we became concerned about the second largest producer of oil on the planet.Curiously enough I got an email about my initial review of thsi film that told me to ""go back home"" if I didn't like it here. In truth, I am Naragansett Indian, an undistrubed line from my great-grandfather, anyone not of American Indian descent is on MY land my the legal possession rights of America. I am home. But hasn't that always been the racist yell from the battle for Integration, to vote, to exist? That if anyone here in America disagrees, as supposedly allowed in a democracy, they should :go back to where THEY came from"". Again that ""THEM"". I expect that not every person of any color shares the masses attitudes, except perhaps in this country that through first genocide of millions of Indians and then slavery of several races to build up the financial base became the mess we have today.",5,Thinking is America's least favorite past time,1049241600,"04 2, 2003",2003,6097,"['What', 'film', 'so', 'remarkable', 'truth', 'ultimately',

There is no question that there is a problem with gun violence, and Mr. Moore tackles this issue head on in Bowling.Does he do it successfully? I don't think so. There are simply too many loose ends and lazy connections that need to be resolved.For example, in his expose of the the Columbine shootings. He targets Lockheed Martin the major corporation that makes arms for the military (because having military technology is conducive to teeage violence). He interviews Marylin Manson on the social reasons of teenage rage and why they kill (because they feel unnaccepted). He then goes on to take on Kmart for selling bullets (because bullets go into guns). He then takes a grand tour of socialist Canada where no one seems die from gun wounds (because capitalism seems to breed violence).So in conclusion, we can safely say that teens tend to kill because we have alienated teens, living in a greedy capitalist society, with corporations that make military grade weapons and shop at Kmart. It really is a neat arguement if it works. The problem is, there is no real one cause and no real way of knowing why people go on shooting sprees.Moreover, Mr. Moore never quite addresses the question of personal responsibility and family supervision. Where are the PARENTS in this movie? Is it possible that a loving mother and father could have saved the day? Nah. Of course not, they are  not in the movie. However, it is possible that Marlyin Manson may have the key to unlocking the mysteries of the universe.Otherwise, this is a thoroughly engaging and entertaining movie.",3,Now This is Propoganda,1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,1638,"['Gun', 'control', 'hot', 'issue', 'America', 'will', 'be', 'long', 'time', 'question', 'problem', 'gun', 'violence', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'issue', 'head', 'Bowling.Does', 'do', 'successfully', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'lazy', 'connections', 'need', 'be', 'resolved.For', 'example', 'expose', 'Columbine', 'shootings', 'Lockheed', 'Martin', 'major', 'corporation', 'arms', 'military', 'having', 'military', 'technology', 'conducive', 'teeage', 'violence', 'Marylin', 'Manson', 'social', 'reasons', 'teenage', 'rage', 'why', 'kill', 'feel', 'unnaccepted', 'then', 'take', 'Kmart', 'selling', 'bullets', 'bullets', 'go', 'guns', 'then', 'grand', 'tour', 'socialist', 'Canada', 'where', 'one', 'die', 'gun', 'wounds', 'capitalism', 'breed', 'violence', '.So', 'conclusion', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'teens', 'tend', 'kill', 'have', 'alienated', 'teens', 'living', 'greedy', 'capitalist', 'society', 'corporations', 'make', 'military', 'grade', 'weapons', 'shop', 'Kmart', 'really', 'neat', 'arguement', 'problem', 'real', 'one', 'cause', 'real', 'way', 'knowing', 'why', 'people', 'go', 'shooting', 'sprees.Moreover', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'never', 'quite', 'question', 'personal', 'responsibility', 'family', 'supervision', 'Where', 'are', 'PARENTS', 'movie', 'possible', 'loving', 'mother', 'father', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'day', 'Nah', 'course', 'not', 'are', 'not', 'movie', 'However', 'possible', 'Marlyin', 'Manson', 'may', 'have', 'key', 'unlocking', 'mysteries', 'universe.Otherwise', 'thoroughly', 'engaging', 'entertaining', 'movie']",Bowling For Columbine VHS
739454,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B00008DDVU,OverTheMoon,"[4, 12]","America got a double-dose of realism when both ""Gangs of New York"" and ""Bowling for Columbine"" where released. It is not surprising that many Americans hate this ""documentary"", which they unfairly call - a fraud. Make no mistake about it - this is a film about Michael Moore as much as it is about the subject matter and there is more than just a smidgen of  Jerry Springer hiding behind that smile. The fact is that those who think that this documentary is nonsense will more than likely appraise American foreign policy after watching reruns of Bruce Willis saving those ""helpless African"" people in the Hollywood war propaganda movie - ""Tears of the Sun"".""Bowling for Columbine"" is everything that ""Rambo III"" is not. Of course Moore takes some poetic license in making his documentary and yes there is some subversive editing in the process and some bad statistics, but at its heart Moore is asking those same questions that Americans where screaming in the 1960s. ""Why do Americans need guns?"", ""Why is America so violent?"" and ""Why are Americans so cruel to each other?"" What Moore is really hitting at is not the American people but their own government and the manipulation of the media. He shows us what lies beneath the fabric of ""God Bless America"" with the ""fat cat"" business types, political corruption, the military industrial complex, crime and paranoia. It all adds up to a ticking bomb and Moore goes to great pains to show that there needs to be change or else the country is basically going to open itself up to some form of martial law.Moore is a visionary and presents us with a glimpse of the future if things do not change. He dishes it out in many forms by undertaking interviews with people of all types, from different backgrounds, age groups and professions on different topics such a gun control, terrorism, hate crimes, paranoia and the mass media. He presents us with problems such as mind control, war mongering, media generated hysteria and social detachment which appear in a series of documentary segments that are connected by the one link - gun control.This is one of the most important documentaries you will ever likely see. It should be treated with a degree of skepticism, not everyone or everywhere in America has the problems that Moore lists and some other counties have them too!, but anyone who trashes this film by saying that it is nothing more than totally subjective and self-proclaiming is guilty of complete and utter ignorance - one of the many themes that Moore himself treats in his documentary. Remember those kids at Columbine who shot and killed their classmates? No one listened to them when they needed to be heard. Their calls for help (and they did call for help) where met with ignorance.In many ways this documentary is the evolution of Reality TV. Springer-types bring up topics to embarrass people or exploit their guests who just want to be on television. They USE people to get the ratings that they need. I was expecting that Moore would do the same, and he does at times, but what he is really trying to show is a truth that is hidden within every American. Watch them breakdown in tears when they say something that they should not have said. Watch them cry when they make the mistake of saying what is obviously on their mind but some sort of unknown PRESSURE prevents them from doing so in public. Where is this pressure coming from? Who causes that and Why? There is something mystical lurking there in the background. Its something that Moore can not quite put his finger on - but he sure as hell can bring it out. Even though the documentary has no real resolution you can conclude that the whole ""America is great"" feeling that has been bashed into people has been hijacked at some point by those who wish to manipulate the people of that great nation for their own profit. This is what Moore eludes too and he brings it out by generating emotional interviews.This documentary is prophetic and regardless of how patriotic you are, you should watch it and take some time to think about it. Moore is a breath of life and you should be thankful that someone stuck their head on the guillotine to ask the questions that everybody wants to ask and say the things that everybody wants to say.",5,&#65533;Its an ethnic thing&#65533; - Charlton Heston,1066780800,"10 22, 2003",2003,4262,"['America', 'got', 'double-dose', 'realism', 'when', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'where', 'released', 'not', 'surprising', 'many', 'Americans', 'hate', 'documentary', 'unfairly', 'call', 'fraud', 'Make', 'mistake', 'film', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'as', 'much', 'subject', 'matter', 'more', 'just', 'smidgen', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'hiding', 'smile', 'fact', 'who', 'think', 'documentary', 'nonsense', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'appraise', 'American', 'foreign', 'policy', 'watching', 'reruns', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'saving', 'helpless', 'African', 'people', 'Hollywood', 'war', 'propaganda', 'movie', 'Tears', 'Sun', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'everything', 'Rambo', 'III', 'not', 'course', 'Moore', 'poetic', 'license', 'making', 'documentary', 'yes', 'subversive', 'editing', 'process', 'bad', 'statistics', 'heart', 'Moore', 'asking', 'same', 'questions', 'Americans', 'where', 'screaming', '1960s', 'Why', 'do', 'Americans', 'need', 'guns', 'Why', 'America', 'so', 'violent', 'Why', 'are', 'Americans', 'so', 'cruel', 'other', 'What', 'Moore', 'really', 'hitting', 'not', 'American', 'people', 'own', 'government', 'manipulation', 'media', 'what', 'beneath', 'fabric', 'God', 'Bless', 'America', 'fat', 'cat', 'business', 'types', 'political', 'corruption', 'military', 'industrial', 'complex', 'crime', 'paranoia', 'up', 'ticking', 'bomb', 'Moore', 'great', 'pains', 'show', 'there', 'be', 'change', 'else', 'country', 'basically', 'going', 'open', 'up', 'form', 'martial', 'law.Moore', 'visionary', 'presents', 'glimpse', 'future', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'change', 'out', 'many', 'forms', 'undertaking', 'interviews', 'people', 'types', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'age', 'groups', 'professions', 'different', 'topics', 'such', 'gun', 'control', 'terrorism', 'hate', 'crimes', 'paranoia', 'mass', 'media', 'problems', 'such', 'mind', 'control', 'war', 'mongering', 'media', 'generated', 'hysteria', 'social', 'detachment', 'appear', 'series', 'documentary', 'segments', 'are', 'connected', 'one', 'link', 'gun', 'control.This', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'documentaries', 'will', 'ever', 'likely', 'see', 'should', 'be', 'treated', 'degree', 'skepticism', 'not', 'everyone', 'everywhere', 'America', 'problems', 'Moore', 'lists', 'other', 'counties', 'have', 'too', 'anyone', 'who', 'film', 'saying', 'nothing', 'more', 'totally', 'subjective', 'self-proclaiming', 'guilty', 'complete', 'utter', 'ignorance', 'one', 'many', 'themes', 'Moore', 'documentary', 'Remember', 'kids', 'Columbine', 'who', 'shot', 'killed', 'classmates', 'one', 'listened', 'when', 'needed', 'be', 'heard', 'calls', 'help', 'did', 'call', 'help', 'where', 'met', 'ignorance.In', 'many', 'ways', 'documentary', 'evolution', 'Reality', 'TV', 'Springer-types', 'bring', 'up', 'topics', 'embarrass', 'people', 'exploit', 'guests', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'television', 'USE', 'people', 'get', 'ratings', 'need', 'was', 'expecting', 'Moore', 'would', 'do', 'same', 'times', 'what', 'really', 'trying', 'show', 'truth', 'hidden', 'American', 'Watch', 'breakdown', 'tears', 'when', 'say', 'something', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'said', 'Watch', 'cry', 'when', 'make', 'mistake', 'saying', 'what', 'obviously', 'mind', 'sort', 'unknown', 'PRESSURE', 'doing', 'so', 'public', 'Where', 'pressure', 'coming', 'Who', 'Why', 'something', 'mystical', 'lurking', 'there', 'background', 'something', 'Moore', 'can', 'not', 'quite', 'put', 'finger', 'sure', 'hell', 'can', 'bring', 'out', 'Even', 'documentary', 'real', 'resolution', 'can', 'conclude', 'whole', 'America', 'great', 'feeling', 'been', 'bashed', 'people', 'been', 'hijacked', 'point', 'who', 'wish', 'manipulate', 'people', 'great', 'nation', 'own', 'profit', 'what', 'Moore', 'too', 'out', 'generating', 'emotional', 'interviews.This', 'documentary', 'prophetic', 'regardless', 'how', 'patriotic', 'are', 'should', 'watch', 'take', 'time', 'think', 'Moore', 'breath', 'life', 'should', 'be', 'thankful', 'someone', 'stuck', 'head', 'guillotine', 'ask', 'questions', 'everybody', 'ask', 'say', 'things', 'everybody', 'say']",Bowling For Columbine VHS
739455,A3U4VUSBJMR5KP,B00008DDVU,Patrick A. Hayden,"[6, 11]","Reviewing ""Bowling for Columbine"" is difficult from an objective standpoint, as almost all of the reviews here prove.  They range from praise that some would save for, say, the Dali Lama, to the kind of active hate I usually save for child killers.  The reason is not so much the ""documentary"", but the man who made it: Michael Moore.  Moore is a polarizing figure, he has his ardent followers and he has his angry detractors, and no one in the middle.  One liberal reviewer in the Washington DC City Paper called Moore the man ""who gives Liberal Muckraking a bad name""  So if the review sounds biased, I apologize in advance.""Bowling for Columbine"" is a stunningly effective piece of propaganda.  Superbly entertaining, very very funny, and you leave the movie asking yourself some hard questions.  Unfortunately for Moore, some of those questions lead back to the truthfulness of his film.  Getting the gun from the bank-staged.  Footage of Charleton Heston saying ""From my Cold Dead Hand"" at an NRA meeting in Colorado after Coolumbine-actually much older footage of an event that took place on the East Coast.  Footage of the NRA meeting in Flint after a little girl was killed by a classmate-the meeting took place almost a year after it had happened.  Moore edits like crazy to make his targets look insensitive.  He's a master of staging events.The most chilling part of the film is his interview with the ""third bomber"" from Oklahoma City.  Interesting yes, and yes, there are crazy types out there, but what did it have to do with anything?  Moore throws a lot of information at the viewer, possibly in a hope that no one will catch his most glaring errors.  However, thinking about a lot of the film in bits leaves you with the impression that it is much less than the sum of it's parts.  His bizzare questioning of the Lockheed/Martin spokesman in which he asks the man if he thinks that having a missle factory in the backyard caused Columbine.  Of course, that plant manufactures rockets that send satellites into space, but that doesn't matter to Moore.  He mentions the bombing of Kosovo as another possible motive for the attacks.  While this makes no sense, it feeds into Moore's thesis: that we are frightened nation of Gun Nuts.  The highly insulting cartoon(which, by the way folks, was NOT produced by the South Park Duo)equates owning a gun with hating African-Americans and supporting the KKK.  No real connection is made, but the fact that Moore says it exists is enough for his fans, who always said as much in private and are overjoyed that a narcissitic egomaniac who shares their views said it.There are a couple of very good segments.  The first is when he talks with South Park co-creator Matt Stone, who makes some very valid points about the kind of verbal abuse many teens deal with in High School.  In fact, better documentaries have been made about that very subject.  Moore doesn't follow through, too content to blame the Government for everything.  The second point, which I actually heartily agree with, is that the media hypes violence.  Moore walks through South Central LA with a sociologist and they talk about how even though violent crime has been dropping in this country, the number of news stories covering murders has increased exponentially.  If it bleeds, it leads.  If the film were less sensationalistic, more thoughtful commentary like this would make it in, instead of wild claims that try to link the Vietnam War to Columbine.In the end, the reason the film will probably be seen as a failure in the future is that it is all really about Moore.  He is a self-promoter in the finest tradition of PT Barnum(I mean that as a compliment)  From his self-serving endorsement of Ralph Nader in 2000 to his infamous Oscar speech and his plans to make a documantary blaming the entire Bush family for every crime ever committed against humanity, Moore is best at promoting himself.  Countless people in the film have since come out saying they felt used by Moore, from Lockheed Martin to one of the Columbine survivors Moore took to K-Mart to get than to stop selling ammo.  Moore will use any tragedy to advance his own cause-himself.  He is, in the end, a charlatan and elitist posing as an everyman.  His film cannot be judged without the correct view of the man who made it.  You can dislike Moore and agree with his views, but I've found very few who do.  Liberal or conservative.  Thoughtful conservatives(those who did the actual research that dispels much of his ""proof"" find Moore's trashing of them insulting, and thoughful, concerned liberals, while sypathetic to some of his causes, would rather have someone willing to debate with facts and reality than the strange, upside-down stuff Moore comes up with.  His film is not ""truth"" in any sense of the word.  If you think I'm insane, check out no-spin websites that are truly nonpartisan that have the same problem.  Check out LIBERAL sites that call him and his motives into question.  But in the end, do what Moore wants you to do with the rest of the world to him: look deeper, and see the rotten Underbelly and black heart at the heart of this ""fictitious""

739456,A329U9CDUPKXAC,B00008DDVU,Patrick,"[3, 12]","This film exposes many disturbing statistics like how more Americans kill each other with guns than any other country even though all the other countries watch the same violent movies, listen to the same violent music, have sometimes more violent histories and have the same amount of gun as America. So where is this hate coming from in the USA? Michael Moore says it's fear brought on by the people in power. I agree with this pretty much. George W. Bush did a wonderful job of scaring the living daylights out of Americans after September 11th. People lined up out of stores to buy guns and gas masks. He even scared the American people into a war with Iraq by making them believe they were out to get them and they had these weapons of mass destruction that they were ready to use at any moment. Americans are very persuasive people. Tell them to jump off a cliff and they just might do it. By the way, I am an American and I'm not bashing the USA. But I agree with Michael Moore and think there is a major problem in this country that we turn to guns and weapons and killing every time we get spooked. The interview with Charlton Heston is priceless. When he found out he had no answers for Michael's questions he just gets up and leaves the room like a coward. The problem I have with this film is Michael Moore seems to spin things a bit too much. When he was in Canada he tried to show how people there leave their doors unlocked. He went door to door to make us shocked that all the people left their doors open. The thing was, it was day time. Most people don't lock their doors unless they either leave their house or go to bed. I know my door is unlocked during the day when I'm home. So this isn't shocking when he walks up to a door and it's unlocked yet he wants us to believe it is. There are other facts Michael spins to lead people over to his side but an intelligent person can figure this out. Over all, I found Michael's film entertaining and interesting.",4,No Spin Zone?,1063497600,"09 14, 2003",2003,1976,"['film', 'many', 'disturbing', 'statistics', 'how', 'more', 'Americans', 'kill', 'other', 'guns', 'other', 'country', 'even', 'other', 'countries', 'watch', 'same', 'violent', 'movies', 'listen', 'same', 'violent', 'music', 'have', 'sometimes', 'more', 'violent', 'histories', 'have', 'same', 'amount', 'gun', 'America', 'So', 'where', 'hate', 'coming', 'USA', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'fear', 'brought', 'people', 'power', 'agree', 'pretty', 'much', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'scaring', 'living', 'daylights', 'Americans', 'September', '11th', 'People', 'lined', 'up', 'stores', 'buy', 'guns', 'gas', 'masks', 'even', 'scared', 'American', 'people', 'war', 'Iraq', 'making', 'believe', 'were', 'out', 'get', 'had', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'were', 'ready', 'use', 'moment', 'Americans', 'are', 'very', 'persuasive', 'people', 'Tell', 'jump', 'off', 'cliff', 'just', 'might', 'do', 'way', 'am', 'American', ""'m"", 'not', 'bashing', 'USA', 'agree', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'think', 'major', 'problem', 'country', 'turn', 'guns', 'weapons', 'killing', 'time', 'get', 'spooked', 'interview', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'priceless', 'When', 'found', 'out', 'had', 'answers', 'Michael', 'questions', 'just', 'up', 'room', 'coward', 'problem', 'have', 'film', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'spin', 'things', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'When', 'was', 'Canada', 'tried', 'show', 'how', 'people', 'there', 'leave', 'doors', 'unlocked', 'went', 'door', 'door', 'make', 'shocked', 'people', 'left', 'doors', 'open', 'thing', 'was', 'was', 'day', 'time', 'Most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'lock', 'doors', 'leave', 'house', 'go', 'bed', 'know', 'door', 'unlocked', 'day', 'when', ""'m"", 'home', ""n't"", 'shocking', 'when', 'up', 'door', 'unlocked', 'yet', 'believe', 'are', 'other', 'facts', 'Michael', 'lead', 'people', 'side', 'intelligent', 'person', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'found', 'Michael', 'film', 'entertaining', 'interesting']",Bowling For Columbine VHS
739457,A1VA170GUYGTB,B00008DDVU,Paula L. Craig,"[6, 12]","This film made some excellent points about guns and violence in America.  I loved the scene where the Lockheed-Martin representative is talking about Columbine and how we need to reduce violence--while standing in front of a Lockheed missile.  I also liked the scene where a seemingly ordinary teenage boy wearing a loose-fitting shirt turns out to be a walking arsenal, with dozens of guns concealed in his pants.  My husband and I were practically rolling on the floor laughing at that one.Seriously, though, Moore brings across very well how much better our quality of life in the U.S. could be if we rethought our love affair with guns.  Canada has strict laws about registration of guns and the like, and their quality of life is no worse than ours.  What would be so terrible about making sure that lunatics and criminals can't buy guns, and seeing to it that guns used in crimes can be traced?  Although Moore doesn't mention this, I think that gun owners and manufacturers should also be required to pay into a fund that hospitals would use for the enormous health care costs caused by guns.  Gun owners and makers should also pay the cost of the extra policing that guns make necessary.Moore does tend to fall off the liberal deep end at times.  He makes a big deal of the fact that the mother of the 6-year-old who shot his classmate was in a welfare-to-work program, working two jobs, and had no time to supervise her son.  While this is sad, in my opinion Moore is barking up the wrong tree by blaming welfare-to-work.  The first thing to ask is why a woman with no skills and no husband chose to have a son.  Did her church tell her it was a sin to get an abortion?  If so, it should be her church who supports the two of them, not the taxpayers.Another question Moore fails to understand is that it's rather odd that this woman works full time but can't afford to pay rent.  I think more welfare is not the answer here.  The sad fact is that no one has ever figured out a way to spend money to relieve poverty without creating dependency; no matter what you do, you end up with a problem worse than the one you started with.  To find the right answer, you need to ask why housing costs are so high in the U.S., and why there is so little low-cost housing near jobs.  After all, the salary this mother was making at the mall would have put her into the middle class in most countries, and the cost of building materials is simply not that different between countries.  Surprisingly, a big part of the answer as I see it is bad zoning and parking laws and overly restrictive building codes in most U.S. cities.  These laws make it difficult and expensive to build housing here, and the housing that does get built is spread out widely, so that it's hard to get around without a car.  For more on this, see Kunstler's book ""The Geography of Nowhere"" and Shoup's ""The High Cost of Free Parking.""Overall, though, the movie is consistently entertaining.

739458,A19W1FGD76MXOZ,B00008DDVU,Paul Haspel,"[1, 1]","Be advised, when watching Michael Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine"" (2002), that you take your own politics into the theater with you.  Or rather, your politics walk into the theater with you and sit next to you, munching on your popcorn and sipping from your soda cup while constantly whispering in your ear, telling you how you should feel regarding this energetic, in-your-face, deliberately provocative documentary on guns in American society.  And such, I surmise, is exactly how director Moore would want it.The title, of course, refers to the Columbine murders of April 1999, when two heavily armed students at a Colorado high school killed 13 people and injured 24 others before taking their own lives.  Moore reports that the two killers attended a bowling class in the morning before committing the murders, and uses that bizarre and random factoid as the basis for a reflection on gun culture within the United States.Moore manipulates interviews, animation, and file footage with a dizzying degree of kinetic energy.  Many of the scenes in the film are now staples of American popular culture: the bank that offers a free rifle to anyone who opens a new account; the ""Wonderful World"" sequence when Louis Armstrong's melancholy classic is juxtaposed with a historical collage of violent U.S. interventions in other countries, climaxing with the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001; the ""South Park""-style ""Brief History of America"", an animated vignette setting forth Moore's thesis that the American fascination with guns reflects a culture of fear (sociologist Barry Glassner, author of the book ""The Culture of Fear,"" is interviewed at a couple of points); Moore's comparison of gun-rights-oriented America with gun-control-minded Canada; his visit to a Michigan elementary school where one child was fatally shot by another; and, perhaps most famously, a visit to K-Mart corporate headquarters, where one of the survivors of the Columbine murders seeks to return the bullets with which he was shot.""Bowling for Columbine"" won many awards, including the 2003 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.  It is well-made and consistently interesting; and at the same time, I'm not sure I would call it a documentary.  I am a liberal Democrat who would be likely to agree with Moore on most issues; and yet, when watching this movie, I sometimes find myself growing frustrated with the more openly manipulative elements of ""Bowling for Columbine.""  His films are worlds away from the restrained delivery of, say, an Errol Morris documentary; I think they could be referred to more accurately as ""reality movies.""  Moore makes himself the main character of his films -- stalking the halls of schools and stores and corporate boardrooms in his loose-fitting black jacket and Michigan State University baseball cap, consoling the bereaved, seeking information from experts, confronting the complacent.  It is blatantly self-serving, and at the same time it is compulsively watchable.  Like it or not, ""Bowling for Columbine"" always keeps the viewer interested.One of the most powerful moments in the movie, for me, is also one of the simplest.  A long visual collage of talking heads setting forth their theories regarding Columbine is followed by Moore's interview with Marilyn Manson, the shock-rocker whose music was cited by some as a supposed ""cause"" of the murders.  Asked what he would say to the people of Columbine, Manson replies, ""I wouldn't say a single word to them.  I would listen to what they have to say, and that's what no one did.""  The simplicity of the wild-eyed shock rocker's answer eloquently gives the lie to the revealed ""wisdom"" of so much of what we hear on TV every time there is yet another hideous act of gun violence somewhere in the U.S.A.The film climaxes with Moore, an NRA member, interviewing then-NRA leader Charlton Heston.  Heston assumes that the interview will be friendly, but quickly learns otherwise.  Does Heston deserve what he gets, or do you find yourself feeling sorry for the aging movie star of yesteryear?  Watch for yourself and see what you think.Liberals and progressives tend to like Moore's films; conservatives and traditionalists tend not to.  But I think the film does what it sets out to do.  However you feel regarding gun rights, or gun control, or whatever you want to call it, chances are that when you're done with a first viewing of the film, you will want to seek someone out and talk with them regarding guns in America.  And that, once again, is how I think Moore would want it.",5,"Bowling for controversy, with a cinematic gadfly",1352332800,"11 8, 2012",2012,4561,"['Be', 'advised', 'when', 'watching', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', '2002', 'take', 'own', 'politics', 'theater', 'rather', 'politics', 'walk', 'theater', 'sit', 'next', 'munching', 'popcorn', 'sipping', 'soda', 'cup', 'constantly', 'whispering', 'ear', 'telling', 'how', 'should', 'feel', 'regarding', 'energetic', 'in-your-face', 'deliberately', 'provocative', 'documentary', 'guns', 'American', 'society', 'such', 'surmise', 'exactly', 'how', 'director', 'Moore', 'would', 'want', 'it.The', 'title', 'course', 'refers', 'Columbine', 'murders', 'April', '1999', 'when', 'two', 'heavily', 'armed', 'students', 'Colorado', 'high', 'school', 'killed', '13', 'people', 'injured', '24', 'others', 'taking', 'own', 'lives', 'Moore', 'reports', 'two', 'killers', 'attended', 'bowling', 'class', 'morning', 'committing', 'murders', 'bizarre', 'random', 'factoid', 'basis', 'reflection', 'gun', 'culture', 'United', 'States.Moore', 'interviews', 'animation', 'file', 'footage', 'dizzying', 'degree', 'kinetic', 'energy', 'Many', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'now', 'staples', 'American', 'popular', 'culture', 'bank', 'free', 'rifle', 'anyone', 'who', 'new', 'account', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'sequence', 'when', 'Louis', 'Armstrong', 'melancholy', 'classic', 'juxtaposed', 'historical', 'collage', 'violent', 'U.S.', 'interventions', 'other', 'countries', 'climaxing', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'September', '11', '2001', 'South', 'Park', 'Brief', 'History', 'America', 'animated', 'vignette', 'setting', 'forth', 'Moore', 'thesis', 'American', 'fascination', 'guns', 'culture', 'fear', 'sociologist', 'Barry', 'Glassner', 'author', 'book', 'Culture', 'Fear', 'interviewed', 'couple', 'points', 'Moore', 'comparison', 'gun-rights-oriented', 'America', 'gun-control-minded', 'Canada', 'visit', 'Michigan', 'elementary', 'school', 'where', 'one', 'child', 'was', 'fatally', 'shot', 'perhaps', 'most', 'famously', 'visit', 'K-Mart', 'corporate', 'headquarters', 'where', 'one', 'survivors', 'Columbine', 'murders', 'return', 'bullets', 'was', 'shot', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'won', 'many', 'awards', 'including', '2003', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Documentary', 'Feature', 'well-made', 'consistently', 'interesting', 'same', 'time', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'call', 'documentary', 'am', 'liberal', 'Democrat', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'likely', 'agree', 'Moore', 'most', 'issues', 'yet', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'find', 'growing', 'frustrated', 'more', 'openly', 'manipulative', 'elements', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'films', 'are', 'worlds', 'away', 'restrained', 'delivery', 'say', 'Errol', 'Morris', 'documentary', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'referred', 'more', 'accurately', 'reality', 'movies', 'Moore', 'main', 'character', 'films', 'stalking', 'halls', 'schools', 'stores', 'corporate', 'boardrooms', 'loose-fitting', 'black', 'jacket', 'Michigan', 'State', 'University', 'baseball', 'cap', 'consoling', 'bereaved', 'seeking', 'information', 'experts', 'confronting', 'complacent', 'blatantly', 'self-serving', 'same', 'time', 'compulsively', 'watchable', 'not', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'always', 'viewer', 'interested.One', 'most', 'powerful', 'moments', 'movie', 'also', 'one', 'simplest', 'long', 'visual', 'collage', 'talking', 'heads', 'setting', 'forth', 'theories', 'regarding', 'Columbine', 'followed', 'Moore', 'interview', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'shock-rocker', 'music', 'was', 'cited', 'supposed', 'cause', 'murders', 'Asked', 'what', 'would', 'say', 'people', 'Columbine', 'Manson', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'single', 'word', 'would', 'listen', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'what', 'one', 'did', 'simplicity', 'wild-eyed', 'shock', 'rocker', 'answer', 'eloquently', 'lie', 'revealed', 'wisdom', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'hear', 'TV', 'time', 'yet', 'hideous', 'act', 'gun', 'violence', 'somewhere', 'U.S.A.The', 'film', 'climaxes', 'Moore', 'NRA', 'member', 'interviewing', 'then-NRA', 'leader', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Heston', 'interview', 'will', 'be', 'friendly', 'quickly', 'otherwise', 'Does', 'Heston', 'deserve', 'what', 'do', 'find', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'aging', 'movie', 'star', 'yesteryear', 'Watch', 'see', 'what', 'think.Liberals', 'progressives', 'tend', 'like', 'Moore', 'films', 'conservatives', 'traditionalists', 'tend', 'not', 'think', 'film', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'However', 'feel', 'regarding', 'gun', 'rights', 'gun', 'control', 'want', 'call', 'chances', 'are', 'when', ""'re"", 'done', 'first', 'viewing', 'film', 'will', 'want', 'seek', 'someone', 'out', 'talk', 'regarding', 'guns', 'America', 'once', 'again', 'how', 'think', 'Moore', 'would', 'want']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

We have been de-sensitized to violence, our access to weapons is too easy, and our Media concentrates on sensational, often racist, depictions of violence, sustaining the first two areas.Moore's research reveals that our number of murders per year is unaccountably beyond all numbers from other ""first world"", yet they too have been desensitized and have a media which has heavy coverage of violent events. He seems to be saying that number two - the easy access to guns (and the unpopular ""waiting period"") - really prime the pump.His segment on ""Welfare To Work"" is ill-conceived, however. Of course, busing an individual an hour away to work seems inefficient and socially questionable, but it must be assumed that in most cases the implmentation makes geographic sense. So is Welfare better than Work? I think Michael might want to try another Documentary for that question.Another marginal segment is with the elderly Charlton Heston, the NRA Rally Man. It is shocking that he says he did not know of the one on one shooting near the spot of a recent event. But the viewer gets the sense that the interview is more rhetorical than really interesting.Another old guy that Moore bothers is Dick Clark, but for a much less understandable reason: seems DC has a terrible habit of hiring people who desperately need a job: he employs the Mother of the six year old boy who shot the young girl, in a tragic turn of events. Do these ""Old white men"" bear all or som of the blame? Are they the ones who force the child's Mother to ride a bus forty miles away from home for employment? That's like...an hour on a bus!).Eliminating these three sections and creating *one* involving the ""stand-off"" situation at Columbine - in a feature segment, Moore mentions his agony in deciding if such scenes would work in the film - would have been powerful.In the end, however, his naive, slackjawed, hackish hippie-with-the-redneck bent journalism takes a back seat to an amazing display of backbone - he guides us through his *own learning experience* - he begins the film saying that guns are too available and have been made too desireable in his country but then discovers other ""first-world"" countries have the same situation - he admits to the viewer that while he was looking at tragic numbers he was ignoring the basis for them (in his opinion): we seem to have been programmed to grab a gun to help settle a dispute. The viewer then joins Moore and refers back to 11,000 annual murders and asks...I wonder why I carry this thing?",4,Worth watching,1247788800,"07 17, 2009",2009,2640,"['Moore', 'saying', 'Americans', 'live', 'triple-threat', 'threat', 'directed', 'back', 'sometimes', 'outward', 'have', 'been', 'de-sensitized', 'violence', 'access', 'weapons', 'too', 'easy', 'Media', 'sensational', 'often', 'racist', 'depictions', 'violence', 'sustaining', 'first', 'two', 'areas.Moore', 'research', 'number', 'murders', 'year', 'unaccountably', 'numbers', 'other', 'first', 'world', 'yet', 'too', 'have', 'been', 'desensitized', 'have', 'media', 'heavy', 'coverage', 'violent', 'events', 'be', 'saying', 'number', 'two', 'easy', 'access', 'guns', 'unpopular', 'waiting', 'period', 'really', 'pump.His', 'segment', 'Welfare', 'Work', 'ill-conceived', 'however', 'course', 'busing', 'individual', 'hour', 'away', 'work', 'inefficient', 'socially', 'questionable', 'must', 'be', 'assumed', 'most', 'cases', 'implmentation', 'geographic', 'sense', 'Welfare', 'better', 'Work', 'think', 'Michael', 'might', 'want', 'try', 'Documentary', 'question.Another', 'marginal', 'segment', 'elderly', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'NRA', 'Rally', 'Man', 'shocking', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'one', 'one', 'shooting', 'spot', 'recent', 'event', 'viewer', 'sense', 'interview', 'more', 'rhetorical', 'really', 'interesting.Another', 'old', 'guy', 'Moore', 'bothers', 'Dick', 'Clark', 'much', 'less', 'understandable', 'reason', 'DC', 'terrible', 'habit', 'hiring', 'people', 'who', 'desperately', 'need', 'job', 'Mother', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'young', 'girl', 'tragic', 'turn', 'events', 'Do', 'Old', 'white', 'men', 'bear', 'som', 'blame', 'Are', 'ones', 'who', 'force', 'child', 'Mother', 'ride', 'bus', 'forty', 'miles', 'away', 'home', 'employment', 'hour', 'bus', '.Eliminating', 'three', 'sections', 'creating', '*one*', 'involving', 'stand-off', 'situation', 'Columbine', 'feature', 'segment', 'Moore', 'agony', 'deciding', 'such', 'scenes', 'would', 'work', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'end', 'however', 'naive', 'slackjawed', 'hackish', 'hippie-with-the-redneck', 'bent', 'journalism', 'back', 'seat', 'amazing', 'display', 'backbone', '*own', 'learning', 'experience*', 'film', 'saying', 'guns', 'are', 'too', 'available', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'too', 'desireable', 'country', 'then', 'other', 'first-world', 'countries', 'have', 'same', 'situation', 'viewer', 'was', 'looking', 'tragic', 'numbers', 'was', 'ignoring', 'basis', 'opinion', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'programmed', 'grab', 'gun', 'help', 'settle', 'dispute', 'viewer', 'then', 'Moore', 'refers', 'back', '11,000', 'annual', 'murders', 'asks', 'wonder', 'why', 'carry', 'thing']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

This film exposed the mind-set that has created huge revenue streams for gun sales people.  The mind-set is fear.  The same mentality that equates safety with being well-armed is the same mentality that accepts ever larger weapons budgets for the country.  The military industrial complex that we should fear (the one that Eisenhower warned us aboutWhy We Fight) is confiscating more of our tax dollars each year.As ""Bowling for Columbine"" points out, Columbine High School is located in the same district with a huge Lockheed Martin weapons plant.  It's not hard to imagine where the Columbine killers may have picked up the idea that violence is the way to solve problems.It's also important to note that this Lockheed Martin plant is located in the district represented by the demagogue, Tom Tancredo.  Tancredo has made a living lashing out at Muslims (threatening to bomb Mecca), and lashing out at immigrants (threatening to round them all up and put them in detention centers).  I don't think he believes his rhetoric, but he does understand that his bigotry serves the business interests of Lockheed, which will make a ton of money off of the hi-tech wall being contructed along the southern border, in addition to making piles of money with new weapons systems that we terrorize the world with.For more information on the connection between gun sales, fear, and the idolatry of violence among sectors of the US population, I'd recommendGun Show Nation: Gun Culture and American Democracy.",5,Marketing Guns Through Fear,1186358400,"08 6, 2007",2007,1604,"['recently', 're-watched', 'important', 'film', 'so', 'frightened', 'perception', 'managers', 'gun', 'industry', 'film', 'exposed', 'mind-set', 'created', 'huge', 'revenue', 'streams', 'gun', 'sales', 'people', 'mind-set', 'fear', 'same', 'mentality', 'safety', 'being', 'well-armed', 'same', 'mentality', 'ever', 'larger', 'weapons', 'budgets', 'country', 'military', 'industrial', 'complex', 'should', 'fear', 'one', 'Eisenhower', 'warned', 'Fight', 'confiscating', 'more', 'tax', 'dollars', 'year.As', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'out', 'Columbine', 'High', 'School', 'located', 'same', 'district', 'huge', 'Lockheed', 'Martin', 'weapons', 'plant', 'not', 'hard', 'imagine', 'where', 'Columbine', 'killers', 'may', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'idea', 'violence', 'way', 'solve', 'problems.It', 'also', 'important', 'note', 'Lockheed', 'Martin', 'plant', 'located', 'district', 'represented', 'demagogue', 'Tom', 'Tancredo', 'Tancredo', 'made', 'living', 'lashing', 'out', 'Muslims', 'threatening', 'bomb', 'Mecca', 'lashing', 'out', 'immigrants', 'threatening', 'round', 'up', 'put', 'detention', 'centers', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'rhetoric', 'understand', 'bigotry', 'business', 'interests', 'Lockheed', 'will', 'make', 'ton', 'money', 'hi-tech', 'wall', 'being', 'contructed', 'southern', 'border', 'addition', 'making', 'piles', 'money', 'new', 'weapons', 'systems', 'terrorize', 'world', 'more', 'information', 'connection', 'gun', 'sales', 'fear', 'idolatry', 'violence', 'sectors', 'US', 'population', ""'d"", 'recommendGun', 'Show', 'Nation', 'Gun', 'Culture', 'American', 'Democracy']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

And that's the ultimate goal of a documentary, isn't it?  In &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;, Moore examines the fascination with guns and violence in America.

Why do we have the violence with guns that other countries don't?

739479,A1RO577XY0WH5T,B00008DDVU,"Robert Beasley ""Movie Mutt""","[7, 16]","This film is basically about murder, and an anti-second amendment tone rings throughout.  If people aren't using guns to kill others, they would simply use knives, and as far as accidental shootings go, sure that happens.  It happens just like any accidental deaths, including any negligence.  The answer is not gun control, it is gun education and learning how to properly handle a firearm.  You're never going to get rid of every weapon in the world, weapons were created from people who fear bigger people trying to harm them, weapons act as a deterrent for anyone wanting to harm another.  If everyone carried a gun there would be virtually no crime, yes there would be a few more accidental shootings, but the murder rate would plummett.  The 2nd amendment guarantees us the RIGHT to keep and bear arms and it shall not be infringed.  Gun carry permits arm only to keep track of who has guns should we decide to get rid of them all.  I carry a mini copy of the constitution with me, that's my gun carry permit.  This is little more that left wing propaganda used by Moore to make a meaningless point.  He uses Charlton Heston, trying to make him feel bad because a little girl was murdered by a handgun at school.  As if it were his fault,simply because he is a representitive of the NRA.  This load of garbage is also filled with rednecks who have little education, someone Moore can easily disect and make them look like knuckle dragging morons.  All in all this is somewhat entertaining if noting else to see Moore at his most ignorant.  It harps on the dark side of humanity and preaches on only the bad things which have happened in our great country.

It is a shame that, for some, the personal insults have to let fly but then maybe that is what this film is about - FEAR and the perception of it.There are roughly twenty times as many murders with handguns on a per capita basis in the United States than in Canada. The thought that arming you makes you safer holds no water. The US has more than three times the rate of robberies with guns than in Canada, on a per capita basis.There is no doubt that Americans appear to be afraid.  Of what? other Americans?  Why else would so many people have to have so many guns, and not just guns but weapons of mass destruction.  With over 200 million guns held by Americans that means a gun in circulation for 7 out of every 10 men, women and children in the US.There has been a wrong comparison that US have guns yet other countries use different weapons.In the UK (2004) using anything from guns to baseball bats there were 853 murders.  In the United States there were 16,110 murders.Even allowing for a population around 5 times that of the UK the US murder rate is almost 400 percent higher!As usual Michael Moore makes a thought provoking, soul searching point that something is wrong where a bank is also a licensed arms dealer and hands out free guns with new accounts!  That is insane.As a final note which is dedicated to West Yorkshire Police Force`s, very brave Pc Sharon Beshenivsky who was shot dead in cold blood by armed robbers in Bradford city, UK on Friday 18th November 2005.  Let us not forget the law enforcers worldwide who everyday are faced with the very real danger of a maniac with a gunwho will pull the trigger without a blink of an eye and particularly the men and women of the UK police forces who step in time after time, armed with little more than courage and a passion to protect us all.When this happens in the UK the whole nation is shocked and disgusted and we mourn yet more lives shattered by the gun!",5,A COUNTRY IN FEAR?,1126569600,"09 13, 2005",2005,2014,"['little', 'more', 'be', 'said', 'concerning', 'controversial', 'riveting', 'film', 'shame', 'personal', 'insults', 'have', 'let', 'fly', 'then', 'maybe', 'what', 'film', 'FEAR', 'perception', 'it.There', 'are', 'roughly', 'twenty', 'times', 'many', 'murders', 'handguns', 'per', 'capita', 'basis', 'United', 'States', 'Canada', 'thought', 'arming', 'safer', 'water', 'US', 'more', 'three', 'times', 'rate', 'robberies', 'guns', 'Canada', 'per', 'capita', 'basis.There', 'doubt', 'Americans', 'appear', 'be', 'afraid', 'what', 'other', 'Americans', 'Why', 'else', 'would', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'guns', 'not', 'just', 'guns', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', '200', 'million', 'guns', 'held', 'Americans', 'gun', 'circulation', '7', '10', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'US.There', 'been', 'wrong', 'comparison', 'US', 'have', 'guns', 'yet', 'other', 'countries', 'use', 'different', 'UK', '2004', 'using', 'anything', 'guns', 'baseball', 'bats', 'were', '853', 'murders', 'United', 'States', 'were', '16,110', 'murders.Even', 'allowing', 'population', 'around', '5', 'times', 'UK', 'US', 'murder', 'rate', 'almost', '400', 'percent', 'higher', 'usual', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'thought', 'provoking', 'soul', 'searching', 'point', 'something', 'wrong', 'where', 'bank', 'also', 'licensed', 'arms', 'dealer', 'out', 'free', 'guns', 'new', 'accounts', 'final', 'note', 'dedicated', 'West', 'Yorkshire', 'Police', 'Force', 's', 'very', 'brave', 'Pc', 'Sharon', 'Beshenivsky', 'who', 'was', 'shot', 'dead', 'cold', 'blood', 'armed', 'robbers', 'Bradford', 'city', 'UK', 'Friday', '18th', 'November', '2005', 'Let', 'not', 'forget', 'law', 'enforcers', 'worldwide', 'who', 'everyday', 'are', 'faced', 'very', 'real', 'danger', 'maniac', 'gunwho', 'will', 'pull', 'trigger', 'blink', 'eye', 'particularly', 'men', 'women', 'UK', 'police', 'forces', 'who', 'step', 'time', 'time', 'armed', 'little', 'more', 'courage', 'passion', 'protect', 'all.When', 'UK', 'whole', 'nation', 'shocked', 'disgusted', 'mourn', 'yet', 'more', 'lives', 'shattered', 'gun']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

Matinees do not usually sell out. But a documentary? Amazing.This is on the surface a story about the Columbine shooting and gun control. But underneath it's a statement about the use of fear as a business tool that insanely inflates the number of killings by guns in this country. Moore keeps asking why do most major countries have under 200 or under 100 deaths a year caused by guns, while the US has... better I don't give the actual number. Find out when you watch the movie. But it is a LOT, LOT more.I went to see the movie because I read Michael Moore's best selling book Stupid White Men and loved it. Part of my motivation was political. We've been watching the spines of half the democratic members of congress melt away, and Michael's voice has been among the strongest, making the most sense in looking at the thieves and morons in the White House.I'm 51 and a veteran of the good old days of anti Viet Nam War demonstrations, so I wasn't sure how my 22 year old daughter would like it. But she and her fiancee' both really enjoyed it as a smart, entertaining movie. There are times you break out laughing and times you feel sadness-- over senseless violence and stupidity.Another reason I went to see this was because I want it to be a commercial success so corporations, that don't care about politics but do care about profits, will invest in more STORIES that depict the world from a more progressive, liberal perspective. We need people who put stories out there that contradict the big lies that the Bush team spews.One of the reasons I organized my storycon meeting on the art, science and application of story was to explore the power of stories to make the world a better place. Michael Moore is out there at the edges of the story universe, courageously exploring new ways to create, present and use stories to make a difference. The mini story about K-mart, that was a part of this film is a wonderful example of the power of story to make a real difference.Watch it. You'll be glad you did.PS Once you've seen it and loved it,you can get videos of his TV show-- The Awful Truth. They're worth getting-- funny, enlightening. Michael Moore is a unique trip.

739484,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B00008DDVU,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[5, 9]","I really wanted to like this film and it's producer. Always considering myself a gun-control advocate, I also had recoiled at the Littleton school shootings. It honestly pains me that I can not give Moore's work a higher rating.Within hours of the event, Littleton represented an unsightly coalition of politics, school safety, and intra-community pluralism debates. Until it hit the affluent Denver suburb, people were content to pretend that school shootings were only something that happened in the inner cities (the enviroment suburbs were theoretically supposed to protect from). Littleton changed everything permanently.I realized the founding fathers inserted the Second Amendment in a time when there was no police and little evidence of goverment balance. In the abscence of supermarkets, guns were also a critical food source, no hunting could translate into no food supply. If they had lived today, the signers would be aghast some people are insisting on the right to purchase AK-47's. They would most likely be with Moore, myself and other peole who believe the right is not absolute and there are reasonable health and safety restrictions which can exist with the Amendment in place.For another perspective, he travels to Canada. Although they do not have a Second Amendment, their streets are so safe the citizens do not lock their doors at night. Not coincidentally, the crime rate is so low that murders are an isolated occurence in that country. They are bewildered that Americans would want the chance to hurt others.My problem with this film is Moore wastes two hours repeating his message. This potentially backfires with his 'alternative' doccumentary style which bluntly delivers the message the first time presented. Moore takes two hours to present information easily delivered in an hour and 30 minutes format. He does not appear to understand that we were already with him during the first time, and it is not how much you say but how you say things which attracts viewers.Films are supposed to educate the audience, not make them look at their watches in a state of desperation. The best film in the world fails to live up to it's potential if key audiences (both the people who originally want to see and those needing to see a film) are detered by the length. Any family scientist or psychologist will tell you drawn out lectures mute their original intentions and may even spark rebellion to spite the original message. Hopefully Moore would not conciously want to turn off potential supporters.",3,Why use two hours to say America's gun approach is bad??,1080777600,"04 1, 2004",2004,2526,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'film', 'producer', 'Always', 'considering', 'gun-control', 'advocate', 'also', 'had', 'recoiled', 'Littleton', 'school', 'shootings', 'honestly', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'Moore', 'work', 'higher', 'rating.Within', 'hours', 'event', 'Littleton', 'represented', 'unsightly', 'coalition', 'politics', 'school', 'safety', 'intra-community', 'pluralism', 'debates', 'hit', 'affluent', 'Denver', 'suburb', 'people', 'were', 'content', 'pretend', 'school', 'shootings', 'were', 'only', 'something', 'happened', 'inner', 'cities', 'enviroment', 'suburbs', 'were', 'theoretically', 'supposed', 'protect', 'Littleton', 'changed', 'everything', 'permanently.I', 'realized', 'founding', 'fathers', 'inserted', 'Second', 'Amendment', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'police', 'little', 'evidence', 'goverment', 'balance', 'abscence', 'supermarkets', 'guns', 'were', 'also', 'critical', 'food', 'source', 'hunting', 'could', 'translate', 'food', 'supply', 'had', 'lived', 'today', 'signers', 'would', 'be', 'aghast', 'people', 'are', 'insisting', 'right', 'purchase', 'AK-47', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'Moore', 'other', 'peole', 'who', 'believe', 'right', 'not', 'absolute', 'are', 'reasonable', 'health', 'safety', 'restrictions', 'can', 'exist', 'Amendment', 'place.For', 'perspective', 'Canada', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'Second', 'Amendment', 'streets', 'are', 'so', 'safe', 'citizens', 'do', 'not', 'lock', 'doors', 'night', 'Not', 'coincidentally', 'crime', 'rate', 'so', 'low', 'murders', 'are', 'isolated', 'occurence', 'country', 'are', 'bewildered', 'Americans', 'would', 'want', 'chance', 'hurt', 'others.My', 'problem', 'film', 'Moore', 'wastes', 'two', 'hours', 'repeating', 'message', 'potentially', ""'alternative"", 'doccumentary', 'style', 'bluntly', 'message', 'first', 'time', 'presented', 'Moore', 'two', 'hours', 'present', 'information', 'easily', 'delivered', 'hour', '30', 'minutes', 'format', 'not', 'appear', 'understand', 'were', 'already', 'first', 'time', 'not', 'how', 'much', 'say', 'how', 'say', 'things', 'viewers.Films', 'are', 'supposed', 'educate', 'audience', 'not', 'make', 'look', 'watches', 'state', 'desperation', 'best', 'film', 'world', 'live', 'up', 'potential', 'key', 'audiences', 'people', 'who', 'originally', 'want', 'see', 'needing', 'see', 'film', 'are', 'detered', 'length', 'family', 'scientist', 'psychologist', 'will', 'tell', 'drawn', 'out', 'lectures', 'mute', 'original', 'intentions', 'may', 'even', 'spark', 'rebellion', 'spite', 'original', 'message', 'Hopefully', 'Moore', 'would', 'not', 'conciously', 'want', 'turn', 'off', 'potential', 'supporters']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

Although it poses as a ""documentary"" (""nonfiction"", in contrast to the 2000 election, as Moore tells us in his Oscar acceptance speech), a better comparison would be to one of the new crop of ""reality"" TV shows.  The movie is dishonest not only because of its inaccuracies (one hesitates to call them ""lies"", as it's unclear whether they're deliberate or simply a combination of sloppiness and self-deception), but because Moore poses as someone honestly concerned about getting to the bottom of a complex problem while exploiting his subject (and the movie's participants) for cheap laughs and propaganda. It's disturbing because of the gravity of the subject. It's disappointing because Moore is capable of so much more. Rent the movie, certainly; but don't swallow anything Moore says without checking for yourself; in the end, you may learn a great deal, though perhaps it will be more about propaganda than about guns or violence.",2,"Disappointing, Disturbing, & Dishonest",1185753600,"07 30, 2007",2007,1056,"['Bowling', 'Columbine', 'disappointing', 'disturbing', 'dishonest', 'way', ""Moore'sRoger"", 'Menever', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'documentary', 'nonfiction', 'contrast', '2000', 'election', 'Moore', 'Oscar', 'acceptance', 'speech', 'better', 'comparison', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'new', 'crop', 'reality', 'TV', 'shows', 'movie', 'dishonest', 'not', 'only', 'inaccuracies', 'one', 'call', 'lies', 'unclear', ""'re"", 'deliberate', 'simply', 'combination', 'sloppiness', 'self-deception', 'Moore', 'poses', 'someone', 'honestly', 'concerned', 'getting', 'bottom', 'complex', 'problem', 'exploiting', 'subject', 'movie', 'participants', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'propaganda', 'disturbing', 'gravity', 'subject', 'disappointing', 'Moore', 'capable', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Rent', 'movie', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'swallow', 'anything', 'Moore', 'checking', 'end', 'may', 'learn', 'great', 'deal', 'perhaps', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'propaganda', 'guns', 'violence']",Bowling For Columbine VHS
739486,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00008DDVU,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 8]","****1/2 ""If more guns made people safer, then America would be one of the safest countries in the world.""This statement, uttered midway through the film by a Canadian citizen, serves pretty much as the guiding thesis for ""Bowling For Columbine,"" the amazing, eye-opening ""dissertation"" by Michael Moore, which won the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature of 2002.  Moore, the well-known left-wing tub-thumper and self-appointed thorn-in-the-side of the American conservative establishment, is clearly a man on a mission.  He wants to figure out why exactly it is that Americans seem to have a running love affair with violence and guns.  Moore takes on Charlton Heston, the NRA (of which Moore claims to be a member), the news media, and the overall culture of paranoia and fear that seems to hold Americans in its grasp.  The director views the Columbine High School shootings in 1999 as the symptom rather than the cause of the problem, the inevitable tragic outcome of a munitions-obsessed culture.Anybody turning to this film for a ""fair"" and ""unbiased"" study of the problem certainly does not know much about Michael Moore and the kind of movies he makes.  Moore is upfront and utterly unapologetic about his own left-leaning sympathies and the film will assuredly outrage many on the opposing side of the issue.  Yet one thing that even Moore's greatest detractors will have to admit is that he is definitely a man of passion, an individual who sees a problem in the world and who pools his resources and skills as a documentarian to help awaken public consciousness and, thereby, prompt reasonable-thinking people to come up with a solution.Perhaps, the most astonishing thing about ""Bowling For Columbine"" is just how funny so much of it turns out to be.  Though basically a jeremiad, Moore's film still manages to find humor in the mind-bending absurdity and jaw-dropping irony of so much of what we see on screen.  Moore is an amazing satirist, yet in many cases all he has to do is to let the people and situations speak for themselves in order to achieve his laughs.  For instance, he starts off his film answering an ad from a bank (of all places!) that offers its customers a gun for opening up a new account.  No fictional satirist could come up with better material than that.  Why press your issues when your subjects are doing such a fine job of it for you?  From that point on, Moore is off and running, taking swipes at not just the NRA but at the defense industry, the Clinton and Bush administrations, welfare reform, and shows like ""COPS,"" which Moore sees as exploiting and enhancing Americans' irrational fear of crime and people of color.  In some ways, these are the weakest sections of the film, perhaps because Moore seems to be casting his net a bit too widely, muddling his message and making assumptions that sometimes seem unwarranted and overly simplistic.  One appreciates his attempt to come up with some possible wider answers, but, frankly, he is at his most compelling when - for lack of a better phrase - he keeps the gun industry and those who support it clearly in his sights.Still, Moore makes a compelling case for much of what he is implying in this film - that the culture of violence is all-encompassing in this nation and that incidents like Columbine are just small pieces in an overall much larger picture.  Sure there are those who will accuse Moore of being ""un-American,"" of always trying to cast the United States in the worst possible light, of even, perhaps, giving ""aid and comfort"" to the nation's enemies.  Yet, isn't this what a healthy free society needs - someone who is willing to point out a nation's shortcomings in the hope of making it a better place in which to live?  It seems to me we need more Moore's - on both the left and the right - to help keep the powers-that-be honest and connected to the concerns of ordinary people.Alternately hilarious and horrifying, harrowing and heartbreaking, ""Bowling For Columbine"" will make you cry one moment and laugh the next.  Moore is a man in total control of his medium, his message, even, perhaps, his audience.  That might be a scary, dangerous thought if you happen to find yourself on the opposite side of the issue from Moore.  After all, one man's ""truth"" can be another man's ""propaganda.""  All I can suggest is that, regardless of which side of the political spectrum you fall on, give the man a fair hearing.  The right should be so lucky as to have a filmmaker of Mr. Moore's caliber and skill on its team.  Perhaps some day it will.",4,Horrifying and Hilarious Documentary,1065916800,"10 12, 2003",2003,4554,"['****1/2', 'more', 'guns', 'made', 'people', 'safer', 'then', 'America', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'safest', 'countries', 'world', 'statement', 'uttered', 'midway', 'film', 'Canadian', 'citizen', 'pretty', 'much', 'guiding', 'thesis', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'amazing', 'eye-opening', 'dissertation', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Documentary', 'Feature', '2002', 'Moore', 'well-known', 'left-wing', 'tub-thumper', 'self-appointed', 'thorn-in-the-side', 'American', 'conservative', 'establishment', 'clearly', 'man', 'mission', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'exactly', 'Americans', 'seem', 'have', 'running', 'love', 'affair', 'violence', 'guns', 'Moore', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'NRA', 'Moore', 'be', 'member', 'news', 'media', 'overall', 'culture', 'paranoia', 'fear', 'hold', 'Americans', 'grasp', 'director', 'Columbine', 'High', 'School', 'shootings', '1999', 'symptom', 'rather', 'cause', 'problem', 'inevitable', 'tragic', 'outcome', 'munitions-obsessed', 'culture.Anybody', 'turning', 'film', 'fair', 'unbiased', 'study', 'problem', 'certainly', 'not', 'know', 'much', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'kind', 'movies', 'Moore', 'upfront', 'utterly', 'unapologetic', 'own', 'left-leaning', 'sympathies', 'film', 'will', 'assuredly', 'outrage', 'many', 'opposing', 'side', 'issue', 'one', 'thing', 'even', 'Moore', 'greatest', 'detractors', 'will', 'have', 'admit', 'definitely', 'man', 'passion', 'individual', 'who', 'problem', 'world', 'who', 'resources', 'skills', 'documentarian', 'help', 'awaken', 'public', 'consciousness', 'thereby', 'prompt', 'reasonable-thinking', 'people', 'come', 'up', 'solution.Perhaps', 'most', 'astonishing', 'thing', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'just', 'how', 'funny', 'so', 'much', 'out', 'be', 'Though', 'basically', 'jeremiad', 'Moore', 'film', 'still', 'find', 'humor', 'mind-bending', 'absurdity', 'jaw-dropping', 'irony', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'see', 'screen', 'Moore', 'amazing', 'satirist', 'yet', 'many', 'cases', 'do', 'let', 'people', 'situations', 'speak', 'order', 'achieve', 'laughs', 'instance', 'film', 'answering', 'ad', 'bank', 'places', 'customers', 'gun', 'opening', 'up', 'new', 'account', 'fictional', 'satirist', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'better', 'material', 'Why', 'press', 'issues', 'when', 'subjects', 'are', 'doing', 'such', 'fine', 'job', 'point', 'Moore', 'off', 'running', 'taking', 'swipes', 'not', 'just', 'NRA', 'defense', 'industry', 'Clinton', 'Bush', 'administrations', 'welfare', 'reform', 'COPS', 'Moore', 'exploiting', 'enhancing', 'Americans', 'irrational', 'fear', 'crime', 'people', 'color', 'ways', 'are', 'weakest', 'sections', 'film', 'perhaps', 'Moore', 'be', 'casting', 'net', 'bit', 'too', 'widely', 'muddling', 'message', 'making', 'assumptions', 'sometimes', 'seem', 'unwarranted', 'overly', 'simplistic', 'One', 'attempt', 'come', 'up', 'possible', 'wider', 'answers', 'frankly', 'most', 'compelling', 'when', 'lack', 'better', 'phrase', 'gun', 'industry', 'who', 'support', 'clearly', 'sights.Still', 'Moore', 'compelling', 'case', 'much', 'what', 'implying', 'film', 'culture', 'violence', 'all-encompassing', 'nation', 'incidents', 'Columbine', 'are', 'just', 'small', 'pieces', 'overall', 'much', 'larger', 'picture', 'Sure', 'are', 'who', 'will', 'accuse', 'Moore', 'being', 'un-American', 'always', 'trying', 'cast', 'United', 'States', 'worst', 'possible', 'light', 'even', 'perhaps', 'giving', 'aid', 'comfort', 'nation', 'enemies', ""n't"", 'what', 'healthy', 'free', 'society', 'someone', 'who', 'willing', 'point', 'out', 'nation', 'shortcomings', 'hope', 'making', 'better', 'place', 'live', 'need', 'more', 'Moore', 'left', 'right', 'help', 'keep', 'powers-that-be', 'honest', 'connected', 'concerns', 'ordinary', 'people.Alternately', 'hilarious', 'horrifying', 'harrowing', 'heartbreaking', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'will', 'make', 'cry', 'one', 'moment', 'next', 'Moore', 'man', 'total', 'control', 'medium', 'message', 'even', 'perhaps', 'audience', 'might', 'be', 'scary', 'dangerous', 'thought', 'happen', 'find', 'opposite', 'side', 'issue', 'Moore', 'one', 'man', 'truth', 'can', 'be', 'man', 'propaganda', 'can', 'suggest', 'regardless', 'side', 'political', 'spectrum', 'fall', 'give', 'man', 'fair', 'hearing', 'right', 'should', 'be', 'so', 'lucky', 'have', 'filmmaker', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'caliber', 'skill', 'team', 'Perhaps', 'day', 'will']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

Michael Moore is making another attempt to point the finger and show you who is to blame.  In Roger and Me, he pointed the finger at corporate america as the plight of the american work force.  In Bowling for Columbine it's the ancient views of the conservatives and the right to bare arms, of which I am in favor in.  Again, at the Academy awards the finger was pointed at our President, calling him a ficticious president.  It's much easier to point the finger than to take the resposibility for oneself, especially when pointing the finger proves itself as a good way to make a living.If guns in society are truly the problem then how do you explain the increasing rate of children under 12 committing sexual molestation, rape and murder, without the use of guns?  What will you point your finger at next Mr. Moore?  At what point will we admit that it just may be the lack of moral and religious values that we instill in our children?  Society has become so cautious not to intrude on the values and beliefs of the few, but what will become of the freedom of the masses?  The value of religion in our schools is that it makes individuals resposible for themselves and their sins, even when there are no visible witnesses.Michael Moore will probably continue to entertain and maintain an audience, just as Jerry Springer has his own group of viewers.

That being said, I found Bowling for Columbine to be without merit for the following reasons.First, Moore's many interviews add little to our understanding of the tragedy at Columbine High School.  In fact, the film reminded me more of David Letterman making fun of his guests than Charlie Rose trying to understand the meaning of a serious problem by talking with intelligent people with information to share.  Additionally, without the variety of point of view needed to give balance to the discussion, the film dragged on and on.Next, Moore's editing of his material was similar to the tiny bits and pieces of information shown on the evening news to hold the attention of a public needing constant stimulation and entertainment. Moore needs to take a lesson from Jim Lehrer who stays focused on his subject in order to arrive at reasonable closure.  Also, Moore juxtaposes images to manipulate his audience and suggest valid comparison where none exists.Lastly, Moore takes a shotgun approach to his documentary.  He fires his blasts here and there hoping to get a hit and occasionaly he does, but the hits are few and far between.  At the end of the film Moore interviews Charlton Heston, looking much the worse for wear and tear, and tries to get Heston to tell us why Columbine happened.  Heston hasn't a clue and neither does Moore.

Of course there are going to be a handful of negative reviews when some people are so willing to bend over backwards to find a problem with Michael Moore.There are, however, also some very, very good reviews, and I would encourage visitors of amazon.com to consider the agenda of those people who have attempted to drive down sales of this item through negative feedback. Rather than encouraging people to become informed from a variety of ideological sources, conservatives have made it their mission to stiffle liberal ideas. I would personally suggest that you watch this movie and also read something like Ann Coulter's ""Slander,"" and then make up your own mind, rather than having it made up for you by a lack of information.Also, to say that this film is ""liberal"" in the common sense of the term is a misrepresentation. In most ways it is liberal, except that it is a film about the dangers of gun violence and it quite specifically DOES NOT SUPPORT GUN CONTROL. I think that Michael Moore likely started filming with every intention of making a movie about the wonders of gun control, but what he found in his investigation steered him away from this ideology. This is a sign of the open-mindedness with which Mr. Moore approaches a liberal agenda. I was impressed to see one of the staples of liberal-dom, gun control, thrown out upon further investigation. Mr. Moore recognized that other concerns had more impact on the issues that he was discussing.As to the meat of the film, it would be inappropriate to ruin anything specifically. Michael Moore's presentation of the issues is so ingenious that to hint at his method of approach would do the film a disservice. What I can say is that there is an animated history lesson that should be shown in every school, an interview with Charlton Heston that should be shown to every closet racist, and a segment about Canada that should encourage Americans to travel even in the face of SARS.This is a fine film.

739498,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00008DDVU,Samuel McKewon,"[13, 30]","""Bowling for Columbine"" is only as enlightening as the viewer is unenlightened. I suppose that might be true for most films, but especially here; independent filmmaker Michael Moore isn't telling me anything I didn't already know about guns, fear and violence in America. The film is a handy, humorous summation of the sad truth, but it lacks the ability to outrage and uncover like Moore's ""Roger & Me"" did in the 1980s.Moore, who is a little too ""unassuming"" for my taste, especially when he conducts cheap, calculated interviews, does do one thing very well: He captures what it is to live amongst violent elements in America. He visits a gun survivalist training camp, where he finds middle class men firing semi-automatic weapons because, maybe, they can. He interviews high school dropouts who built bombs out of boredom. He goes to Canada and discovers that people just aren't as afraid up there. And he skewers the news media, especially local television stations, which amp up everyone's fear of violence nationwide through bleeding, leading stories even though crime stats show that many crimes have been reduced in the last decade. Moore also tries to cobble some kind of real argument against the NRA without using the gun availability argument -- Moore believes it isn't the problem -- and fails, mostly because, if gun availability isn't the problem, then there is little you can pin on the NRA outside of insensitivity.At times, ""Bowling for Columbine"" is funny, at times it's ridiculous, and at times it's inspiring -- as when K-Mart agrees to discontinue the sale of ammunition because Moore trots a few Columbine victims in front of them.And at the end it's cruel, as Moore arrives at close to dawn to launch a two-minute attack on NRA president Charlton Heston, already suffering from Alzheimer's, by peppering him with ridiculous questions about why Heston showed up in Denver and Flint, Mich., days after school shooting tragedies. Moore dives into Heston so fast that he ravages the actor for thinking America's violent history and mixed ethnicity might have something to do with our modern gun violence.It is the ""mixed ethnicity"" comments that NRA watchdogs and liberals pounced on -- they wanted to paint Heston was a racist gun goon, I guess -- but to argue that racism has played no role in this nation's violent upbringing is to swear off reality. I'm sure Moore thinks he's pulled a fast one on Ol Moses, but friends I've spoken with since I've seen the movie were split 50/50 on Moore's questionable ethics in that scene.""Bowling for Columbine"" was a hit at the Cannes Film Festival in France. Well of course it was, and so it will be all over the world -- the movie is a firm indictment of America's cavalier attitude toward death and violence. It is our greatest problem. ""Bowling for Columbine"" states that fact, and if there are Americans who weren't worried before, may they see this movie and become worried.From my own vantage point, I fear Moore's pissed and scared off so much of the pertinent establishment in America that he will live out his career interviewing high school dropouts and bullying Dick Clark as Clark zooms away in a promo van. We can jeer and laugh for a little bit, and Moore might even win the (da da da dum!) Academy Award for this film, but he's painting himself into a jester's corner and, eventually, the crowd is going to file away.",3,Reinventing the wheel?,1047081600,"03 8, 2003",2003,3397,"['Bowling', 'Columbine', 'only', 'as', 'enlightening', 'viewer', 'unenlightened', 'suppose', 'might', 'be', 'true', 'most', 'films', 'especially', 'here', 'independent', 'filmmaker', 'Michael', 'Moore', ""n't"", 'telling', 'anything', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'guns', 'fear', 'violence', 'America', 'film', 'handy', 'humorous', 'summation', 'sad', 'truth', 'ability', 'outrage', 'uncover', 'Moore', 'Roger', 'Me', 'did', '1980s.Moore', 'who', 'little', 'too', 'unassuming', 'taste', 'especially', 'when', 'cheap', 'calculated', 'interviews', 'do', 'one', 'thing', 'very', 'well', 'what', 'live', 'amongst', 'violent', 'elements', 'America', 'gun', 'survivalist', 'training', 'camp', 'where', 'middle', 'class', 'men', 'firing', 'semi-automatic', 'weapons', 'maybe', 'can', 'high', 'school', 'dropouts', 'who', 'built', 'bombs', 'boredom', 'Canada', 'discovers', 'people', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'there', 'news', 'media', 'especially', 'local', 'television', 'stations', 'up', 'everyone', 'fear', 'violence', 'nationwide', 'bleeding', 'leading', 'stories', 'even', 'crime', 'stats', 'show', 'many', 'crimes', 'have', 'been', 'reduced', 'last', 'decade', 'Moore', 'also', 'cobble', 'kind', 'real', 'argument', 'NRA', 'using', 'gun', 'availability', 'argument', 'Moore', ""n't"", 'problem', 'fails', 'mostly', 'gun', 'availability', ""n't"", 'problem', 'then', 'little', 'can', 'pin', 'NRA', 'insensitivity.At', 'times', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'funny', 'times', 'ridiculous', 'times', 'inspiring', 'when', 'K-Mart', 'discontinue', 'sale', 'ammunition', 'Moore', 'trots', 'few', 'Columbine', 'victims', 'front', 'them.And', 'end', 'cruel', 'Moore', 'close', 'dawn', 'launch', 'two-minute', 'attack', 'NRA', 'president', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'already', 'suffering', 'Alzheimer', 'peppering', 'ridiculous', 'questions', 'why', 'Heston', 'showed', 'up', 'Denver', 'Flint', 'Mich.', 'days', 'school', 'shooting', 'tragedies', 'Moore', 'Heston', 'fast', 'actor', 'thinking', 'America', 'violent', 'history', 'mixed', 'ethnicity', 'might', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'modern', 'gun', 'violence.It', 'mixed', 'ethnicity', 'comments', 'NRA', 'watchdogs', 'liberals', 'pounced', 'wanted', 'paint', 'Heston', 'was', 'racist', 'gun', 'goon', 'guess', 'argue', 'racism', 'played', 'role', 'nation', 'violent', 'upbringing', 'swear', 'off', 'reality', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Moore', 'pulled', 'fast', 'one', 'Ol', 'Moses', ""'ve"", 'spoken', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'were', 'split', '50/50', 'Moore', 'questionable', 'ethics', 'scene', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'was', 'hit', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'France', 'Well', 'course', 'was', 'will', 'be', 'world', 'movie', 'firm', 'indictment', 'America', 'cavalier', 'attitude', 'death', 'violence', 'greatest', 'problem', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'fact', 'are', 'Americans', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'worried', 'may', 'see', 'movie', 'become', 'own', 'vantage', 'point', 'fear', 'Moore', 'pissed', 'scared', 'off', 'so', 'much', 'pertinent', 'establishment', 'America', 'will', 'live', 'out', 'career', 'interviewing', 'high', 'school', 'dropouts', 'bullying', 'Dick', 'Clark', 'Clark', 'away', 'promo', 'van', 'can', 'jeer', 'laugh', 'little', 'bit', 'Moore', 'might', 'even', 'win', 'da', 'da', 'da', 'dum', 'Academy', 'Award', 'film', 'painting', 'jester', 'corner', 'eventually', 'crowd', 'going', 'file', 'away']",Bowling For Columbine VHS
739499,A3CYFDQZH4H5GL,B00008DDVU,SandmanVI,"[8, 15]","Getting a little bored w/ the left wing/right wing garbage? Well how about getting the opinion of a moderate (I'm from San Francisco but I own a home &amp; have a family... you do the math). I am not in the NRA, do not own a gun, and actually have never even seen one up close. Ok enough about me. Moore presents HIS opinion (he makes no claim to be objective... and he isn't) in a manner that sometimes is thought-provoking while other times totally annoying and narrow-minded. Let me give you some examples.The segment on Marylin Manson is excellent. Moore debunks the idea that Manson (or makers of industrial rock in general - KMFDM and NIN were also lumped into the Columbine fray) was in some way responsible for what occured. Great point - I've often wondered why people, conservative and liberal both, are so eager to jump on the music someone listens to if it's non-mainstream music but do not address the issue when the killer listens to mainstream music, which is far more often the case. I can assure you that listeners of Goth/Industiral are probably America's smallest problem... try hip hop (ya think?). Or how about the Beatles? What, 6 or 7 of history's most famous murderers are Lennon fanatics (Mark Chapman, Charles Manson, ...). Ooh them Beatles are spooky.However the link between the Columbine massacre and the proximity to a Lockheed-Martin office is inane. First, these kids likely had no idea that this office (it's not even a manufacturing plant as Moore insinuates) exists, and if they did they probably have no concept of what the company does. Therefore the idea that somehow this links into their collective subconscious and engenders an aura of violence is ludicrous. However, Moore looks at the sign with the sad face, drops his head and shakes it like he's disgusted, so obviously you are an idiot if you don't follow his thought process (this condescending BS is why Moore can't be taken too seriously). Consider this: European airports, train stations and government buildings are filled with people carrying fully automatic weapons openly for everyone to see - even been to the Frankfurt airport? Why doesn't this open display have the same effect on Europeans? Moore's argument is just empty here.Often Moore intentionally twists the truth by taking things completely out of context. He doesn't tell you this but it's clear to anyone paying attention. He splices pieces from multiple sources, cuts &amp; edits out critical comments, and places quotes into context where they were not intended. This is just abuse of his media position and really is quite shameful for a man who wants to be listened to. This is why he has no power beyond preaching to his own dedicated choir. Certainly no conservative will be won over. I have never met a moderate who could stomach his unreal amount of spin and distortion.On a basic level, BfC is entertaining and at moments thought-provoking. The breakdown of logic and resorting to fallacious arguments unfortunately makes the film come up far short. One more question for the readers. Is it really important how people are killed or simply that they are killed? Do the people who kill do so simply because they have a gun? Would a gangster murder someone in a drug feud if he didn't have a gun? My guess is yes he would. Certainly the gun offers convenience and that's an issue but it does not create the urge to kill. What the people rarely tell you is that the US not at the top of the homicide list. In fact it's about 10th between N. Ireland and Argentina. All of the nations above the US have higher non-gun homicide rates than our total homicide rate. Think about that . People actually kill even w/o guns. Now I'm not a gun-proponent (never owned and never will) but maybe we should look at what drives the violent urge and determine if it is preventable or not. Maybe it isn't? Perhaps it is a factor of our melting pot society or our extensive freedom. Japan doesn't some of our issues because they are incredibily homogenous - think about it. And why do the Swiss and Israelis have such low homicide rates when they are so heavily armed per capita (much higher gun ownership rates than U.S.)? Maybe this goes back to that homogeneity point I just made. Anyway, stop resorting to name calling and think about the issue and then determine if Moore really makes intelligent and thorough arguments.",2,Interesting but Slanted &amp; Filled w/ Logical Breakdowns,1089244800,"07 8, 2004",2004,4380,"['Getting', 'little', 'bored', 'left', 'wing/right', 'wing', 'garbage', 'Well', 'how', 'getting', 'opinion', 'moderate', ""'m"", 'San', 'Francisco', 'own', 'home', 'amp', 'have', 'family', 'do', 'math', 'am', 'not', 'NRA', 'do', 'not', 'own', 'gun', 'actually', 'have', 'never', 'even', 'seen', 'one', 'up', 'close', 'enough', 'HIS', 'opinion', 'claim', 'be', 'objective', ""n't"", 'manner', 'thought-provoking', 'other', 'times', 'totally', 'annoying', 'narrow-minded', 'Let', 'give', 'examples.The', 'segment', 'Marylin', 'Manson', 'excellent', 'Moore', 'idea', 'Manson', 'makers', 'industrial', 'rock', 'general', 'KMFDM', 'NIN', 'were', 'also', 'lumped', 'Columbine', 'fray', 'was', 'way', 'responsible', 'what', 'occured', 'Great', 'point', ""'ve"", 'often', 'wondered', 'why', 'people', 'conservative', 'liberal', 'are', 'so', 'eager', 'jump', 'music', 'someone', 'non-mainstream', 'music', 'do', 'not', 'address', 'issue', 'when', 'killer', 'mainstream', 'music', 'far', 'more', 'often', 'case', 'can', 'assure', 'listeners', 'Goth/Industiral', 'are', 'probably', 'America', 'smallest', 'problem', 'try', 'hip', 'hop', 'think', 'how', 'Beatles', 'What', '6', '7', 'history', 'most', 'famous', 'murderers', 'are', 'Lennon', 'fanatics', 'Mark', 'Chapman', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'Ooh', 'Beatles', 'are', 'link', 'Columbine', 'massacre', 'proximity', 'Lockheed-Martin', 'office', 'inane', 'First', 'kids', 'likely', 'had', 'idea', 'office', 'not', 'even', 'manufacturing', 'plant', 'Moore', 'insinuates', 'did', 'probably', 'have', 'concept', 'what', 'company', 'Therefore', 'idea', 'somehow', 'collective', 'subconscious', 'engenders', 'aura', 'violence', 'ludicrous', 'However', 'Moore', 'sign', 'sad', 'face', 'head', 'disgusted', 'so', 'obviously', 'are', 'idiot', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'thought', 'process', 'condescending', 'BS', 'why', 'Moore', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'too', 'seriously', 'Consider', 'European', 'airports', 'train', 'stations', 'government', 'buildings', 'are', 'filled', 'people', 'carrying', 'fully', 'automatic', 'weapons', 'openly', 'everyone', 'see', 'even', 'been', 'Frankfurt', 'airport', 'Why', ""n't"", 'open', 'display', 'have', 'same', 'effect', 'Europeans', 'Moore', 'argument', 'just', 'empty', 'here.Often', 'Moore', 'intentionally', 'truth', 'taking', 'things', 'completely', 'context', ""n't"", 'tell', 'clear', 'anyone', 'paying', 'attention', 'pieces', 'multiple', 'sources', 'cuts', 'amp', 'out', 'critical', 'comments', 'places', 'context', 'where', 'were', 'not', 'intended', 'just', 'abuse', 'media', 'position', 'really', 'quite', 'shameful', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'listened', 'why', 'power', 'preaching', 'own', 'dedicated', 'choir', 'Certainly', 'conservative', 'will', 'be', 'won', 'have', 'never', 'met', 'moderate', 'who', 'could', 'stomach', 'unreal', 'amount', 'spin', 'distortion.On', 'basic', 'level', 'BfC', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'thought-provoking', 'breakdown', 'logic', 'resorting', 'fallacious', 'arguments', 'unfortunately', 'film', 'come', 'up', 'far', 'short', 'One', 'more', 'question', 'readers', 'really', 'important', 'how', 'people', 'are', 'killed', 'simply', 'are', 'killed', 'Do', 'people', 'who', 'kill', 'do', 'so', 'simply', 'have', 'gun', 'Would', 'gangster', 'murder', 'someone', 'drug', 'feud', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'gun', 'guess', 'yes', 'would', 'Certainly', 'gun', 'convenience', 'issue', 'not', 'create', 'urge', 'kill', 'What', 'people', 'rarely', 'tell', 'US', 'not', 'top', 'homicide', 'list', 'fact', '10th', 'N.', 'Ireland', 'Argentina', 'nations', 'US', 'have', 'higher', 'non-gun', 'homicide', 'rates', 'total', 'homicide', 'rate', 'Think', 'People', 'actually', 'kill', 'even', 'w/o', 'guns', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'gun-proponent', 'never', 'owned', 'never', 'will', 'maybe', 'should', 'look', 'violent', 'urge', 'determine', 'preventable', 'not', 'Maybe', ""n't"", 'Perhaps', 'factor', 'melting', 'pot', 'society', 'extensive', 'freedom', 'Japan', ""n't"", 'issues', 'are', 'incredibily', 'homogenous', 'think', 'why', 'do', 'Swiss', 'Israelis', 'have', 'such', 'low', 'homicide', 'rates', 'when', 'are', 'so', 'heavily', 'armed', 'capita', 'much', 'higher', 'gun', 'ownership', 'rates', 'U.S.', 'Maybe', 'back', 'homogeneity', 'point', 'just', 'made', 'Anyway', 'stop', 'resorting', 'name', 'calling', 'think', 'issue', 'then', 'determine', 'Moore', 'really', 'intelligent', 'thorough', 'arguments']",Bowling For Columbine VHS
739500,A2GP52Z7CFJ7B5,B00008DDVU,Scott C. Smith,"[6, 12]","Ultimately, Michael Moore fails to answer the question that is essentially the basis for ""Bowling for Columbine"": why are Americans so violent?  There are no easy answers to that question.  Moore centers the film in Littleton, Colorado and the shootings at Columbine High where he tries to make sense of the senseless.  It's a difficult task.  Moore travels to Canada, where there are millions of guns but few gun-related deaths.  Why? The viewer is frustrated, along with Moore, that this question cannot be answered.Shock rocker Marilyn Manson, whose fans included Columbine shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, is interviewed by Moore, and displays more intelligence and empathy than he is given credit.  What would he say, Moore asks, to Harris and Klebold?  Nothing, Manson replied.  ""I'd listen to them.""Sure, Moore takes some dramatic license in the film.  The opening segment has Moore at a bank that offers a free rifle for opening an account.  The piece is edited to look as if Moore got the gun right away, which he didn't; he had to wait for a background check.  But that's really a non-issue, as Moore illustrates: how absurd is it for a bank to give guns to customers?  Another segment has Moore purchasing ammunition from a barber shop, as he gets a haircut.  All of it ties together to the fact that guns are everywhere, readily available to anyone who wants them, and lots of people are dying because of it.Other segments center on the NRA and it's then-president, Charlton Heston.

He didn't just go to Kmart and ask about the bullets sold in their stores. He talked to the NRA head. He didn't just do an overview of the shooting at a high school. He also covered the six-year-old who shot another classmate. I enjoy how he takes one topic and explores the diversity of it, and quite honestly, I think he did an excellent job of showing the pros and cons of gun control. Well, mainly cons, but he did let those who are pro-gun control express their ""pros.""

Truly, you have to admire Moore for his story telling.I have absolutely no inclination of getting into left or right wing accusations because it is a documentary, a polemic one -- and what is wrong with that? -- and does a terrific job of it. Websites and counter-theories abound re. how BFC is [false] or why Moore should be discredited. Well, Moore *is* an intentionally factious director/writer, so anyone not familiar with his ways is likely to feel gyped. But he always has very true, relevant, well-argued hypotheses and pulls out some of the most endearing footage to support them.If this was a straight-on documentary, it would be on National Geographic or the Discovery channel. It wasn't. This was a ""Hollywood movie"", with good reason. That is what Michael does, and much to the chagrin of people like you (and me) he does it rather well.The only thing that I find somewhat quaint, if not laugh-out-loud funny, is Moore being awarded the ""Best documentary"" Oscar, which confuses people into believing that this was your everyday documentary, and should thus have kept to the rigor and honesty expected of such productions.If you know how to 'consume' Moore's movies/books, then this is a gripping treat.

Michael Moore wanders into a dozen different places to talk to a variety of people about guns. Why do Americans kill each other so much, he asks? The film builds steadily to a sensible conclusion: We're scared.Whether he's talking to the father of a teenager killed at Columbine, Marilyn Manson, Charlton Heston, or a schoolteacher in Michigan, the same themes return: Fear, consumerism, racist scapegoating, and mixed messages about guns and violence. As Marilyn Manson says, &quot;Keep them scared and keep them buying stuff. It's a cycle.&quot; The mixed messages come in the form of overseas bombing by the US military and weapon-building at Lockheed Martin. (The Lockheed Martin plant made nuclear missiles but, by the time the documentary was shot, the missiles were converted to peacetime use to launch satellites. Then again, those satellites are part of the US military, so the point Moore makes in the missile plant still makes sense.)These themes are not wrapped up at the end into a final, definitive answer. Moore is smart enough to leave the issue open-ended. This film is the beginning of the story, not the end.The extras on this DVD are not necessary --- the documentary stands on its own, as Moore says in the introduction --- but they add a lot of worthwhile commentary. One of the best parts is the interview on the Charlie Rose show, where Moore makes a strong case against the Bush administration, the invasion of Iraq, and the so-called war against terrorism. This feels like a teaser to his next film. His 15-minute talk about his Oscar speech is also very good. Instead of showing the speech, he sits at a picnic table in someone's yard, holding the Oscar statue as he explains what happened and what he said.

This documentary is NOT saying that if we had better gun control Columbine wouldn't have happened. Don't get the wrong idea. The film merely examines gun control, the film also is not a one-sided job.

In FH9/11 Michael Moore seems to know everything, but in &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; he's constantly running around trying to find an answer to the problem rather than presenting us with one. Amazingly enough this works. The documentary soon isn't another factoid but rather an editorial of American culture.The film has several powerful points that will stand out in your mind (such as when Moore goes to the K-Mart headquarters with two children shot at Columbine to &quot;return the merchandise&quot;).The problem with the film however is simply that many points it seems as if Moore is talking just to hear himself preach. That and once again we're taken to Flint Michigan. Well, there's nothing wrong with going to Flint, Michigan but Moore is ALWAYS taking us to his hometown. I've nothing against Flint but I'm getting tired of seeing it in every documentary Moore comes up with.Ultimately this is a good movie to watch.

It mixes actual archival news footage, animation, and candid interviews to get its points across.  This is all balanced with Moore's own brand of humor.The title of this documentary comes from the police investigation that revealed that the two students who were responsible for the Columbine High School killings in April 1999 went bowling before the massacre.I think the most revealing thing about this documentary is when Moore asks: ""How many people are killed by guns each year?""  He gives the answer by indicating the yearly gun killings for seven specific countries:(1) Germany: 381(2) France: 255(3) Canada: 165(4) United Kingdom: 68(5) Australia: 65(6) Japan: 39(7) UNITED STATES: 11,127There are some hilarious scenes in this documentary.  My three favorites are:(1) When Moore goes to an actual US bank and asks the teller:  ""I want the account where I can get the free gun.""  Once the account is opened, he asks the question that titles this review.(2) When Moore suggests that there should not only be a TV show called ""Cops"" but there should also be one called ""Corporate Cops.""  He then acts out some exciting scenes from this made-up show.(3) The animated cartoon called ""A Brief History of America.""There are also some upsetting scenes.  Two (besides the scenes of what actually happened at Columbine High School) that stood out for me are:(1) When a six-year old boy stole a gun and killed at his school an innocent six-year old girl (named Kayla).(2) When we are shown the resultant disabling condition of two students who survived the Columbine massacre.Who will you hear or see in this documentary??  Some names are:Michael Moore, Charlton Heston (NRA president and actor), Marilyn Manson, Bill Clinton, Timothy McVeigh (Oklahoma City building bomber), Terry Nichols (Oklahoma City building bombing accomplice), James Nichols (brother of Terry Nichols), George W. Bush, Eric Harris (Columbine murderer), Dylan Klebold (Columbine murderer), Adolf Hitler, Chris Rock, and Dick Clark.The main problem I had with this documentary is that a few times Moore does not stick with his theme of violence and guns.  For example, take the case of the little boy who shot the little girl.  It turns out that the little boy's mother did not know he took a gun to school because his single mother on welfare was forced to participate in a ""welfare to work"" program.  That is, she was to busy working to look properly after her little boy.  I felt that this particular story should have ended here.However, Moore then starts interviewing officials involved in the welfare program.  He eventually finds out that the mother had to work at one of Dick Clark's restaurants.  Knowing this, he goes to interview, of all people, Dick Clark.I felt all of this was unnecessary and somewhat distracting.  Moore does things like this infrequently.As the many, many reviews below this one attest, you will either dislike (even hate) or like (even love) this movie.  But isn't this a sign of a good movie--to illicit strong emotion?Finally, the DVD itself is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has over ten extras, all of which I found to be interesting and informative.In conclusion, I urge you to see this movie documentary yourself and discover why it won an Oscar!!**** 1/2(2002;  2 hr;  2 discs;  widescreen;  32 scenes)+++++",4,"""Don't you think it's a little dangerous handing out guns in a bank??""",1127779200,"09 27, 2005",2005,3564,"['+++++This', 'movie', 'documentary', 'was', 'written', 'produced', 'directed', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'who', 'life-time', 'member', 'National', 'Rifle', 'Association', 'NRA', 'look', 'violence', 'general', 'guns', 'particular', 'United', 'States', 'mixes', 'actual', 'archival', 'news', 'footage', 'animation', 'candid', 'interviews', 'get', 'points', 'balanced', 'Moore', 'own', 'brand', 'humor.The', 'title', 'documentary', 'police', 'investigation', 'revealed', 'two', 'students', 'who', 'were', 'responsible', 'Columbine', 'High', 'School', 'killings', 'April', '1999', 'went', 'bowling', 'massacre.I', 'think', 'most', 'revealing', 'thing', 'documentary', 'when', 'Moore', 'How', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'killed', 'guns', 'year', 'answer', 'indicating', 'yearly', 'gun', 'killings', 'seven', 'specific', 'countries', '1', 'Germany', '381', '2', 'France', '255', '3', 'Canada', '165', '4', 'United', 'Kingdom', '68', '5', 'Australia', '65', '6', 'Japan', '39', '7', 'UNITED', 'STATES', '11,127There', 'are', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'documentary', 'three', 'favorites', 'are', '1', 'When', 'Moore', 'actual', 'US', 'bank', 'teller', 'want', 'account', 'where', 'can', 'get', 'free', 'gun', 'account', 'opened', 'question', 'review', '2', 'When', 'Moore', 'should', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'TV', 'show', 'called', 'Cops', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'one', 'called', 'Corporate', 'Cops', 'then', 'out', 'exciting', 'scenes', 'made-up', 'show', '3', 'animated', 'cartoon', 'called', 'Brief', 'History', 'America', 'are', 'also', 'upsetting', 'scenes', 'Two', 'scenes', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'Columbine', 'High', 'School', 'stood', 'out', 'are', '1', 'When', 'six-year', 'old', 'boy', 'stole', 'gun', 'killed', 'school', 'innocent', 'six-year', 'old', 'girl', 'named', 'Kayla', '2', 'When', 'are', 'shown', 'resultant', 'disabling', 'condition', 'two', 'students', 'who', 'survived', 'Columbine', 'massacre.Who', 'will', 'hear', 'see', 'documentary', 'names', 'are', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'NRA', 'president', 'actor', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'Timothy', 'McVeigh', 'Oklahoma', 'City', 'building', 'bomber', 'Terry', 'Nichols', 'Oklahoma', 'City', 'building', 'bombing', 'accomplice', 'James', 'Nichols', 'brother', 'Terry', 'Nichols', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'Eric', 'Harris', 'Columbine', 'murderer', 'Dylan', 'Klebold', 'Columbine', 'murderer', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Dick', 'Clark.The', 'main', 'problem', 'had', 'documentary', 'few', 'times', 'Moore', 'not', 'stick', 'theme', 'violence', 'guns', 'example', 'take', 'case', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'shot', 'little', 'girl', 'out', 'little', 'boy', 'mother', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'took', 'gun', 'school', 'single', 'mother', 'welfare', 'was', 'forced', 'participate', 'welfare', 'work', 'program', 'was', 'busy', 'working', 'look', 'properly', 'little', 'boy', 'felt', 'particular', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'here.However', 'Moore', 'then', 'interviewing', 'officials', 'involved', 'welfare', 'program', 'eventually', 'out', 'mother', 'had', 'work', 'one', 'Dick', 'Clark', 'restaurants', 'Knowing', 'interview', 'people', 'Dick', 'Clark.I', 'felt', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'somewhat', 'distracting', 'Moore', 'things', 'many', 'many', 'reviews', 'one', 'attest', 'will', 'either', 'dislike', 'even', 'hate', 'even', 'love', 'movie', ""n't"", 'sign', 'good', 'movie', 'illicit', 'strong', 'emotion', 'Finally', 'DVD', 'perfect', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'over', 'ten', 'extras', 'found', 'be', 'interesting', 'informative.In', 'conclusion', 'urge', 'see', 'movie', 'discover', 'why', 'won', 'Oscar', '****', '1/2', '2002', '2', 'hr', '2', 'discs', '32', 'scenes', '+++++']",Bowling For Columbine VHS
739512,A171FU7AC9YYMS,B00008DDVU,"Steve Forsyth ""sforsythnoe""","[6, 11]","I wish I could split my rating - because this movie can be divided into two parts.  The first hour and a half was extraordinary.  Moore managed an honestly objective look at the subject, exploring with what at least appeared to be an open mind the reasons for the gun-death rate being so high in America.  Many good points were made and sound arguments brought out (I was particularly interested in the argument about the negetive re-enforcement of U.S. news media and how they and their advertisers use fear to sell their own newscasts and the products they advertise).  Truth be told, no one makes a pseudo-documentary like Michael Moore!However, as he often does, Moore manages to throw away any good points he earned with the first half by drowning the final thirty minutes of the movie in an attempt to lay the blame for Columbine and other shootings at the feet of K-Mart, Dick Clark, and Charlton Heston!  Moore's style in these segments echo the more irritating portions of Roger and Me - the idea tha because someone says something stupid (or refuses to speak at all) when a camera is suddenly shoved in their face, therefore they MUST be to blame for all of society's ills!  Moore needs to learn a little respect for other people if he is going to try to be a mouthpiece for the causes he believes in.  Like I said, I think he has alot of good things to say, but these guerilla-camera tactics draw attention away from the good and instead reveal what an a**hole he can be.  I mean - what's the deal with the whole Dick Clark encounter?!  Let me lay this out for you - a 1st grader shoots another 1st grader.  We learn the gun came from his uncle's house.  The kid is living with his uncle because his mother cannot afford to house him or put him in day care.  She can't because she is on welfare and expected to (I believe the word he uses is FORCED TO) work outside of Flint in Dick Clark's such-and-such restaraunt.  So what does Moore do?  He heads right out to interview Dick Clark, and stands in appaled shock with that ""shame-on-you-Dick-Clark"" look on his face as Clark refuses to talk to him and drives off.  See what I'm saying?  The fault for the shooting is laid on Dick Clark  because a restaurant he's probably never stepped into which happens to have his name on it hired a woman whose son stole his uncle's gun and shot a girl?  That's Dick Clark's fault?  Where is the interview with the school for the gun making it into the classroom - how about interviewing the mother for being so removed from her son he would be led to do such a thing - how about intervieing the uncle for having a home in which a first-grader could even handle a gun, much less take it out of the house!What's worse is the commentary track by his interns and assistants.  Kudos for a great idea, letting the ""little guy"" talk for once.  But the result here is just a Michael Moore fan-club.  The kiddos on the commentary clearly worship the ground he walks on and hope to be him when they grow up.So - FIVE stars for the first portion of the film that is a credit to Moore and all who worked on the film.  But ZERO stars for the final act in which Moore sabotages his work and the work of those who helped him by being pretentious and trying to earn a few extra viewers with ""controversial filmmaking.""

739513,AL277B4AQCWBG,B00008DDVU,Steven Reynolds,"[53, 96]","Moore wants to know why the US has more gun-related homicides than any other Western nation. Surprisingly, he concludes, it isn't only the number or availability of handguns. It's fear. His America is a nation of terrified citizens, haunted by unbalanced media with a relentless daily focus on global and suburban threat, driven to seek refuge in the right to bear arms. Guns and fear are a lethal combination, and the statistics speak for themselves: over 11,000 killings annually, when most other nations don't even make triple digits. Moore's thesis is a surprising one in that it contradicts America's image of brash self-confidence, but the evidence is compelling. There are some wonderful moments in this documentary: Marilyn Manson's surprisingly articulate analysis of why his music is blamed for teen violence and his take on the actual factors which inspire it; a former producer of ""COPS"" frankly admitting that violence makes for good television; and music guru Dick Clark refusing to even listen to (let alone answer) questions about a welfare worker from one of his mall developments. But the real stars are the ordinary people: the police, the teachers, a tearful security expert, the academics, the polticians, and two young survivors of Columbine who, with Moore's help, literally disarm K-Mart.  Moore spends plenty of time on the narrative soapbox and edits together some heavily polemical montages, but for the most part he just rolls tape, asks questions, and lets the idiots bury themselves - none more so than Charlton Heston who, when confronted with uncomfortable questions about NRA strategy and his own apparent racism, is left speechless.

What is their function?  Oh yeah!  To kill people!  I suppose there are some that like to shoot at targets, (that look like people) but that cannot be considered to be an assault weapon's primary function.  Just consider the term: ASSAULT WEAPON.  These weapons are extremely hazardous.  They are designed to spew forth massive quantities of bullets in very little time.  They serve absolutley no useful purpose.  And yet it seems that Americans will sacrfice their safety in order to appease their ridiculous gun fetish.  It's futher evidence of the state of un-reality in which most Americans live.In Bowling for Columbine, Michael Moore asks the pertinent question, ""Why do Americans kill each other?""  More specifically, he wants to know why our murder rate is so much higher than that of any other country.  Several theories are considered and rejected until finally, Moore finds an explanation that is not so easily refuted.  Not only are Americans pumped full of fear by the media, they are offered no security, no safety net from their government.  Unemployment may be worse in Canada, but there is little to no homelessness.I found this argument very convincing.  On the other hand, I think it is only part of the equation.  I think that many Americans have a love affair with violence and with guns in particular.

Michael Moore's gift for telling it like it is, abundantly evident in this film, was my incentive for traveling that distance and he did not let me down. This two hour documentary film focuses primarily on the peculiar culture of fear that our government and our media have fostered that makes Americans feel the need to keep everything under constant vigilance, secured by locks, keys, and cameras, armed and at the ready for defense.  It focuses on our culture of mistrust and violence.  It shows how painfully shut off from each other we are, as well as how little responsibility we take for the well-being of each other.  It shows a shocking level of ignorance, the ugly stepsister of fear. It is done in Moore's characteristic satirical style and so it is very funny, even entertaining in spots, but it also has heaping measures of his bold, straight-forward questioning of the status quo.  He takes on the NRA as well as several corporate and government programs.  He talks with gun thieves, the Michigan Militia, Terry Nichols' brother James, Charleton Heston, and for the voice of reason, Marilyn Manson. He includes some very shattering footage of the legacy of guns we have turned upon our international neighbors, sometimes ousting freely elected leaders to set up dictators and murderers, as well as siting statistics in terms of body count that these tactics have created.  We squirm in our seats as chilling footage of the legacy of fear trickles hideously down to our children.  We grimace with shame and disgust at the small-minded, ignorant, and painfully narrow viewpoints of our own elected officials, law enforcement, media, and corporate people.  Numerous comparisons are made of other countries around the world with similar backgrounds to ours who do not have thousands and thousands of killings from guns every single year. We stand alone as gun-toting killers.  There are some bright spots that show how ordinary citizens can change this climate of fear and senseless, irrational defensiveness that were encouraging.This film is asking us to stop and take a look with common sense and recognize that Chicken Little might have it wrong...maybe the sky is not falling...maybe we don't need to be armed to the teeth.  As with all of Moore's books and films, regardless of your own political viewpoint, you are bound to come away from this film with plenty of food for thought.  You will be asked to pull your head up out of the sand for a couple of hours and take a good look at yourself, our leaders, your future and the future of our country.

This despite how much we admire his entire body of work. The reason? Because he has nailed one of the most fundamental - if not THE fundamental reason that change is slow and often non-existent in such critical areas as health care, environment, political issues, and industry regulation. Fear. Americans clearly fear everything, and most particularly change, and creativity. Since solving the above problems requires creativity - certainly conventional thinking isn't getting anywhere!) - and action, we are stuck. Unless we face the issue of fear and the constant barrage of fear-based ""information"" we live with, we will never be able to change anything. How scary is change? Given how much we have all been hurt by the current healthcare system, how many of us have been destroyed financially by rampant, unregulated industries such as credit card companies, and basic safety because of lack of safety regulations on imported goods - how can we question change? Because we  are being bombarded with how frightening it will be to have, gasp, ""Socialized Medicine"" - would it be worse than what we have now? No, but the specter of this is heralded as if it would be run by boogeymen. Why would a single American oppose regulation of the banking industry? What on earth would cause us to allow major companies to send jobs out of the country, while collecting enormous tax breaks for employment? Fear, fed to us by our fearful leaders and the media. While all of Moore's other films provide us with information and ammunition to go for positive change - this film gives us the basic change that must be made before any other action will be taken. I strongly recommend it.

It had me in tears.  To see the extent to which fear grips the minds of Americans--fear of terrorists, fear of minorities, fear of the government, fear of being unpopular--the list goes on and on.  Moore makes the point that this fear is what drives the violence in America.  We're constantly bombarded with messages of fear from the media and the government.  For a comparison, look at Canada.  There are a large number of guns in Canada, but the gun violence rate is nowhere near the gun violence rate of America.  Why is this?Some may say that there is a lot of gun violence in America because we have a violent history.  Well, that theory doesn't hold any water.  Germany and Japan have had a very violent history (think of the Holocaust and the Rape of Nanking), but the rate of gun violence in those countries is low compared with America's rate.  Also you can't say it's violent movies or games.  They watch and play those in other countries too.It's about time someone took on the NRA.  Perhaps the saddest scene is the last one in which Charlton Heston struggles to defend his views on gun ownership.  He just sticks his foot in his mouth and had to run away.  I really applaud Moore for his ability to chase down and confront these gun nuts.  You never know when they might snap and take a shot at him.

These two cronies mercilessly murdering 12 classmates indiscriminately and a teacher, before ending their lives together. What went wrong with these two seemingly normal high school kids?In Michael Moore's Oscar winning best documentary, &iexcl;Bowling for Columbine,&iexcl;the director delved into the reasons behind the school shooting. Other facets the film explored are other prominent problems of the United States, such as America's obsession with guns, the increasing fear in US residents, and the many faults of the US government, mainly of the Bush entrepreneurs. Many might deem that Moore did a spectacular job in presenting the truth while supporting his logic with persuading evidence and facts. However, I believe in exactly the opposite.&iexcl;Bowling for Columbine&quot; is not a documentary, it is absolute fiction. After viewing the film, I believe Moore purposely deceives and misleads his audience by supporting his view with biased and slanted deceptions to persuade and he deliberately hid the other point of views of the situations from the viewers.Throughout the film, speeches, video clips, interviews and excerpts from TV program&iexcl;COPS&quot; are shown. They may be strong and well-built proofs, but they can be edited and revised in order to support Moore.For example, in order to back up his argument about African Americans are predominantly troublemakers and lawbreakers, Moore uses about 10 or more passages from COPS showing black people getting chased, hand-cuffed and arrested. As far as I know, there are also white criminals in the States too. This is an example of which Moore surreptitiously alters his information to cajole the viewers into his calculated trap.The evidences that Moore collected was manipulated by him and therefore only supports one side of the arguments &iexcl;V his own.According to an online dictionary, dictionary.com, the definition of a documentary is&iexcl;presenting facts objectively without editorializing or inserting fictional matter, as in a book or film.&iexcl;By this definition,&iexcl;Bowling for Columbine,&iexcl;should not be viewed as a documentary, but as pure entertainment.Moore also suggested in his film, that the media, by exaggerating crimes and murders, were climaxing the fear in the hearts of American citizens. However, with fortified information and manipulated editing, it is his so-called documentary,&iexcl;Bowling for Columbine,&iexcl;that is creating fear and doubt in the hearts of the viewers.",3,manipulated truth,1077753600,"02 26, 2004",2004,2786,"['names', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'wake-up', 'call', 'Americans', 'Dyland', 'Klebold', 'Eric', 'Harris.Dyland', 'Eric', 'are', 'students', 'Columbine', 'High', 'School', 'April', '20th', '1999', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'decided', 'unleash', 'deadliest', 'school', 'shooting', 'history', 'United', 'States', 'two', 'cronies', 'mercilessly', 'murdering', '12', 'classmates', 'indiscriminately', 'teacher', 'ending', 'lives', 'together', 'What', 'went', 'wrong', 'two', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'best', 'documentary', 'iexcl', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'iexcl', 'director', 'delved', 'reasons', 'school', 'shooting', 'Other', 'film', 'explored', 'are', 'other', 'prominent', 'problems', 'United', 'States', 'such', 'America', 'obsession', 'guns', 'increasing', 'fear', 'US', 'residents', 'many', 'faults', 'US', 'government', 'mainly', 'Bush', 'entrepreneurs', 'Many', 'might', 'deem', 'Moore', 'did', 'spectacular', 'job', 'presenting', 'truth', 'supporting', 'logic', 'persuading', 'evidence', 'facts', 'However', 'believe', 'exactly', 'opposite.', 'iexcl', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'quot', 'not', 'documentary', 'absolute', 'fiction', 'viewing', 'film', 'believe', 'Moore', 'purposely', 'deceives', 'misleads', 'audience', 'supporting', 'view', 'biased', 'slanted', 'deceptions', 'persuade', 'deliberately', 'hid', 'other', 'point', 'views', 'situations', 'viewers.Throughout', 'film', 'speeches', 'video', 'clips', 'interviews', 'excerpts', 'TV', 'program', 'iexcl', 'COPS', 'quot', 'are', 'shown', 'may', 'be', 'strong', 'well-built', 'proofs', 'can', 'be', 'edited', 'revised', 'order', 'support', 'Moore.For', 'example', 'order', 'back', 'up', 'argument', 'African', 'Americans', 'are', 'predominantly', 'troublemakers', 'lawbreakers', 'Moore', '10', 'more', 'passages', 'COPS', 'showing', 'black', 'people', 'getting', 'chased', 'hand-cuffed', 'arrested', 'As', 'far', 'know', 'are', 'also', 'white', 'criminals', 'States', 'too', 'example', 'Moore', 'surreptitiously', 'information', 'cajole', 'viewers', 'calculated', 'trap.The', 'evidences', 'Moore', 'collected', 'was', 'manipulated', 'therefore', 'only', 'one', 'side', 'arguments', 'iexcl', 'V', 'own.According', 'online', 'dictionary', 'dictionary.com', 'definition', 'documentary', 'iexcl', 'presenting', 'facts', 'objectively', 'editorializing', 'inserting', 'fictional', 'matter', 'book', 'film.', 'iexcl', 'definition', 'iexcl', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'iexcl', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'viewed', 'documentary', 'pure', 'entertainment.Moore', 'also', 'suggested', 'film', 'media', 'exaggerating', 'crimes', 'murders', 'were', 'climaxing', 'fear', 'hearts', 'American', 'citizens', 'However', 'fortified', 'information', 'manipulated', 'editing', 'so-called', 'documentary', 'iexcl', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'iexcl', 'creating', 'fear', 'doubt', 'hearts', 'viewers']",Bowling For Columbine VHS
739522,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B00008DDVU,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[10, 17]","Those who read my review after I saw this at the theatre know that I think it's Moore's best. But I think the general consensus, that it's about gun control, misses several points.The film had a few weaknesses I'll start out with to appease those who think Michael is a step up from the anti-Christ. First, I think he oversimplifies the race issue. He did so in his little cartoon about the history of guns in the US. He did so too in his comments on COPS, which I've never seen and have no desire to, so I may be wrong in my comment there.And a weaker weakness occured to me only after I saw the film the fourth time: while commenting (appropriately!) that the welfare-to-work program is a sham, one of the program's participants is gabbing into a cell phone as she hops onto the bus to take her to her welfare-to-work job. I find cell phones to be the ultimate frivolity, seldom needed. So a person in such a low-income situation should think of a better place to spend her money.Now, onto what's good about the film:First, as to the gun control issue, I think that's among the issues he discusses. An even bigger one is FEAR! What DID happen with Y2K? Where did the killer (African!) bees start killing us? And that's two of countless other issues he mentions. And even more, it's the commercialization of fear. There are companies--and certainly MEDIA--who make a living off of fear! Why is it we Yanks tend to be so much more fearful than most others in the world?Another one he covered when he said, &quot;It sucks to be a kid,&quot; then shows the schools throughout the US who passed students through the metal detectors, or suspended and expelled them for the color of their hair, or for the anarchist organizations they purport to be creating. The school's administrators wallow in the horror they anticipate, as if they'd never been young and felt alienated!Then there's the history. Several politicians are proclaiming that Marilyn Manson is responsible for our social turmoil, while Michael covers stock footage of the US's take over of Iran, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and our funding of Osama bin Laden and others, including one scene with our president, who doesn't even need reasons for his actions. That was well done. In the meantime, he's talking with someone at Lockheed Martin, the world's largest military contractor, and an economic backbone of the US economy--perhaps the largest employer in none other than where Columbine High School is located.And then there's the issues of media in general. When the six year old shot the six year old girl in Moore's home town of Flint, the local media missed the point. While keeping their hair in place for the camera, they discussed how cute she was and that she loved pizza. But they said nothing of the HISTORY of the area (see &quot;Roger and Me,&quot; on how there used to be well-payed jobs there, and there aren't any more) and the economics, i.e., moms going to work for 70 hours a week plus transportation, and still not being able to afford rent.Some of the critics took it too personally that a few of those to whom Moore spoke were a little ill-prepared. I didn't take that so seriously. And I think he treated Charlton Heston with reasonable respect--even after Heston spoke within days after the Columbine incident AND the one in which the six year old was killed, defending our ostensible right to shoot whatever we like.There were amusing portions, particularly Michael's suggestion to the producer of COPS that he have a show with white-collar criminals being manhandled after their mega-thefts. What, do some critics think that's disrespectful of the powerful? It's about time somebody is!I've always said that one of the better things about the film is that Michael doesn't make up our minds for us. He gives us these scenarios and we are free to conclude what we will. That's another  invaluable element of the film.Was Michael biased? Hmmm. Some critics talk of Moore's obvious slants. Well, often that's the point of art, to make a point. I don't know Moore would call himself &quot;objective.&quot;Oh, and the DVD has the little extras, e.g., Michael discussing his academy award reception speech, and a speech he gives at, I think, the University of Colorado, and others. They make the DVD even better than merely seeing the film at the theater (and they are, I guess, the point of a DVD!)God knows there's other great points of the film that don't cross my mind now. So buy this one, see them yourself. Show it to everyone you know.

739523,A2OI1UXCPO6DEP,B00008DDVU,Tina Engler Keen,"[4, 8]","In BFC, Michael Moore does a brilliant job of analyzing why there is so much violence in America, of exploring what that one thing is that separates us from other nations. Is it because of all the violence in our cinema? No - that's everywhere. Rock-n-roll? Everywhere. Kids being relentlessly picked on in school? Happens everywhere. Guns? Canadians possess as many, or more, as Americans, yet gun shootings are rare up there.What I can't believe is that so many reviewers here have missed the central theme of this documentary...the one thing that separates Americans from Canadians and Europeans is the constant state of fear we are thrown into by the media - a phenomenon missing in other countries. Everything came back to that one conclusion. It was a pretty cut and dry social statement, yet to read other reviews here one would be led to believe the movie was about hating on Charleton Heston or something.Some people here have claimed that Moore took Heston's from my cold, dead hands line out of context, but he didn't. As it's a common catchphrase of the NRA, I think we all know what it means.

739524,A9U5CELFTZ4U8,B00008DDVU,"T. J. Bacon ""TJB""","[2, 6]","In BriefIs America a nation of gun nuts or are they just nuts?  This is the question that the press release for Bowling for Columbine asks us and Michael Moore's new film goes some way in exploring.  Taking the Columbine High School shootings as its focal point, this documentary looks at the aftershock this massacre has had, paralleling it with the gun culture and increasing violence seen both within the States at a domestic level & the murderous events perpetrated by said country on a world level.ReviewDirector, writer, celebrity, political activist, comedian; this is Michael Moore's first documentary film in 13 years since his debut Roger & Me, and it saw its premiere this Sunday as part of the Regus London Film Festival.Since making his first film his political stunt style has developed through his television shows, The Awful Truth & TV Nation and his status as both celebrity and man of the people has been perpetuated through his written work: the most notable being his recent book Stupid White Men, which has been on the New York Times best seller list for over nine weeks!  This was despite his publishers best efforts to make sure it never saw a bookshelf let alone made money and is a testament to the strength of his work that it is now in its 19th printing.So while Moore is obviously a draw, especially to a disillusioned youth or general public, why does Bowling work so well?  The answer is simple, it is honest film making - and his greatest tool is the truth which can be delivered in laugh out loud ""its so scary you have to laugh"" moments, which are equally surrounded by poignant seriously sad & intense segments that depict the awful state of affairs the States has found itself in.From satirising American history through a farcical cartoon, that ironically makes sense, to looking at the FBI checklist of what is a potential teenage time bomb: Are you a depressed teenager?  Do you wear black, feel alienated, use inappropriate humour, abuse drugs or alcohol?  Any of that fit - maybe you could make some headlines next!  His humour is pure genius, and this is an entertaining film that doesn't feel dry and wont leave you looking at your watch!This however is not a film that will purely get a ripple of laughter and fill some seats in a cinema, it forces its audience to question itself.  Indeed, it works well outside of the States as it makes you ask where our own country is going and how long will it be before we reach the level of public disturbance that is witnessed in the USA here.  In 1871, the KKK was made illegal, a few months later a new organisation was formed calling itself the National Rifle Association (NRA), its purpose was to promote gun ownership to whites only.  Until the 1950's the gun was used to keep so-called free blacks in their place, now it's the right of every citizen to carry arms.  America was once an open prairie of wild expanse, an individual needed then to protect themselves, some say that it is still wild but now a different sort of jungle.  Times change and Bowling for Columbine addresses the current `status quo' well, but it is up to the public address what is to be done today.The VerdictCreating a nice narrative progression that works well in a cinema - this film does seem to have an entertaining beginning middle and even a climax.  But being based in reality there is no end that can be said without being done and one man cannot do that alone.  It dares to ask questions that others have yet to put to a mainstream audience but in comparison to his written work, you feel that Moore is pulling his punches in order to make this product just that little bit more commercially appealing.  Nevertheless this is another fantastic film that should not be missed from the auteur that excels in exposing American absurdity.",4,A DANGEROUS FILM,1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,3808,"['BriefIs', 'America', 'nation', 'gun', 'nuts', 'are', 'just', 'nuts', 'question', 'press', 'release', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'new', 'film', 'way', 'exploring', 'Taking', 'Columbine', 'High', 'School', 'shootings', 'focal', 'point', 'documentary', 'aftershock', 'massacre', 'had', 'paralleling', 'gun', 'culture', 'increasing', 'violence', 'seen', 'States', 'domestic', 'level', 'murderous', 'events', 'perpetrated', 'said', 'country', 'world', 'level.ReviewDirector', 'writer', 'celebrity', 'political', 'activist', 'comedian', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'first', 'documentary', 'film', '13', 'years', 'debut', 'Roger', 'Me', 'saw', 'premiere', 'Sunday', 'part', 'Regus', 'London', 'Film', 'Festival.Since', 'making', 'first', 'film', 'political', 'stunt', 'style', 'developed', 'television', 'shows', 'Awful', 'Truth', 'TV', 'Nation', 'status', 'celebrity', 'man', 'people', 'been', 'perpetuated', 'written', 'work', 'most', 'notable', 'being', 'recent', 'book', 'Stupid', 'White', 'Men', 'been', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'best', 'seller', 'list', 'nine', 'weeks', 'was', 'publishers', 'best', 'efforts', 'make', 'sure', 'never', 'saw', 'bookshelf', 'let', 'alone', 'made', 'money', 'testament', 'strength', 'work', 'now', '19th', 'printing.So', 'Moore', 'obviously', 'draw', 'especially', 'disillusioned', 'youth', 'general', 'public', 'why', 'Bowling', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'answer', 'simple', 'honest', 'film', 'making', 'greatest', 'tool', 'truth', 'can', 'be', 'delivered', 'laugh', 'loud', 'so', 'scary', 'have', 'laugh', 'moments', 'are', 'equally', 'surrounded', 'poignant', 'seriously', 'sad', 'intense', 'segments', 'depict', 'awful', 'state', 'affairs', 'States', 'found', 'in.From', 'satirising', 'American', 'history', 'farcical', 'cartoon', 'ironically', 'sense', 'looking', 'FBI', 'checklist', 'what', 'potential', 'teenage', 'time', 'bomb', 'Are', 'depressed', 'teenager', 'Do', 'wear', 'black', 'feel', 'alienated', 'use', 'inappropriate', 'humour', 'abuse', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'fit', 'maybe', 'could', 'make', 'headlines', 'humour', 'pure', 'genius', 'entertaining', 'film', ""n't"", 'feel', 'dry', 'wont', 'leave', 'looking', 'watch', 'however', 'not', 'film', 'will', 'purely', 'get', 'ripple', 'laughter', 'fill', 'seats', 'cinema', 'audience', 'question', 'Indeed', 'well', 'States', 'ask', 'where', 'own', 'country', 'going', 'how', 'long', 'will', 'be', 'reach', 'level', 'public', 'disturbance', 'witnessed', 'USA', 'here', '1871', 'KKK', 'was', 'made', 'illegal', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'new', 'organisation', 'was', 'formed', 'calling', 'National', 'Rifle', 'Association', 'NRA', 'purpose', 'was', 'promote', 'gun', 'ownership', 'whites', 'only', '1950', 'gun', 'was', 'used', 'keep', 'so-called', 'free', 'blacks', 'place', 'now', 'right', 'citizen', 'carry', 'arms', 'America', 'was', 'once', 'open', 'prairie', 'wild', 'expanse', 'individual', 'needed', 'then', 'protect', 'say', 'still', 'wild', 'now', 'different', 'sort', 'jungle', 'change', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'current', 'status', 'quo', 'well', 'public', 'address', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'today.The', 'VerdictCreating', 'nice', 'narrative', 'progression', 'well', 'cinema', 'film', 'seem', 'have', 'entertaining', 'beginning', 'middle', 'even', 'climax', 'being', 'based', 'reality', 'end', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'being', 'done', 'one', 'man', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'alone', 'ask', 'questions', 'others', 'have', 'yet', 'put', 'mainstream', 'audience', 'comparison', 'written', 'work', 'feel', 'Moore', 'pulling', 'punches', 'order', 'make', 'product', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'commercially', 'appealing', 'fantastic', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'auteur', 'exposing', 'American', 'absurdity']",Bowling For Columbine VHS
739525,A16GGCDUETTTDB,B00008DDVU,T-Man,"[8, 10]","""Bowling for Columbine"" attempts to find an answer to a complex question: why do Americans kill each other more than any other industrialized nation (with guns)? As complex as this question already is, Michael Moore seems to make the answer absolutely impossible. In his attempt to find out why, Michael Moore constantly contradicts himself and leaves out several key points of information, and sometimes tells the wrong story. HIs points also have false conjecture in them.Michael Moore explores the many reasons given as to why Americans kill: poverty, high divorce rates, minorities, violence in the media (including movies and video games), America's violent history, and simply, lack of gun control.#1: Poverty: Michael Moore points out a liberal argument that poverty in America makes one commit crimes, he counters that by saying that Canada has a higher unemployment rate (at twice the rate of the U.S. at the time this documentary was made). However, Michael Moore seems to have a lack of understanding as to what poverty really is. ""Poverty"" is defined as having an income below the ""threshold"" (the least amount of money that can get you by depending on where you live and how many people/children/elderly live in your household). ""Unemployment"" means you do not have a job AND are looking for a job. Unemployment, to an extent, can tell you about the state of a country's economy. However, many of the world's industrialized nations have much more generous unemployment and welfare benefits. In some cases, it might be better to remain unemployed than to settle for a low-wage job, unlike here in the U.S. where welfare and unemployment benefits have been cut to the bone. Many people in poverty here in the U.S. actually do work, but can't make enough money to make ends meet. Another point is that every other industrialized nation provides health care and many provide universal college as well. Also, the boys from Columbine were not poor, so why did they shoot all those kids and teachers?Point of contradiction: Michael Moore describes a school shooting incident involving a toddler African-American kid who shot a toddler girl in his grade. His mother could not look after him very well because she was forced, as part of a welfare-to-work program, to take a bus miles away from her house, and work a low-wage job. Had she been able to look after her child, could this have been prevented? Most likely, but does this not contradict Moore's earlier point that poverty does not cause more crime?#2. Divorce rates: Moore counters a point made by conservatives that the divorce rate and the ""break up of the family"" in this country is causing us to commit crimes. He looks at England, and says that they have a higher divorce rate. But then again, if Moore is so convinced that ""unemployment"" means ""poverty,"" England does have a lower unemployment (at least they did when this documentary was made).Point of contradiction: if that toddler boy (mentioned above) had a father around, wouldn't the shooting have been prevented?#3. Violence in the media: Michael Moore points that every other country watches our movies and many violent video games come from Japan, but they don't experience these problems. However, this is where we get to what appears to be Michael Moore's silly theory as to what causes violence in the U.S.: ""the media pumping us full of fear"". In other words, because our media reports on violent crimes (and other scary things that could happen to us), we commit violent crimes. Is the media supposed to stay silent every time a murder occurs.Point of contradiction: Michael ridicules those who say violence in the media causes violence in reality, but he contradicts himself when he claims that ""pumping us with fear"" causes us to commit crimes. Again, it's all about violence in the media.#4. America's violent history: Michael Moore attempts to counter those who say our violent history is a reason for us being violent. Moore points out the violent histories of Britain and France in their colonies, as well as Nazi Germany, but then says that all these countries have low violence rates. However, Michael Moore GREATLY contradicts himself soon afterwards with his ""History of America"" cartoon, which portrays the history of America as a bunch of scared white people shooting everybody. Also, during his ""What a Wonderful World"" sequence, Michael Moore lists many of the violent ""acts"" committed by the U.S., whether through funding, weapons supplying, or direct invasion, in attempt to show that the U.S. does not make weapons only for ""defensive"" purposes. I will make a few points on this:1. During the 'What a wonderful World"" sequence, some of Michael Moore's points have incomplete information and are somewhat erroneous. For example, the ""4 million kill(ed) in Southeast Asia"" has to do with the Vietnam War. Also, Michael Moore fails to note the percentages of the casualties from all of the U.S. interventions were rebels, soldiers, or civilians.2. The United States did not give money to or train ""terrorist groups"" or ""Osama bin Laden"" to ""kill Soviets"". The Soviets, first of all, invaded Afghanistan in 1979. We decided to help fund, supply, and train the Mujahadeen (a.k.a. the Afghan Rebels) to fend them off. After all, we were in a Cold War with the Soviets. Osama bin Laden could very well have been one of the freedom fighters, but he was not on our radar as a ""terrorist"" back then. Second, were we to just sit there and watch Afghanistan fall to the Soviets? Watch them as they massacre Muslim children?3. MIchael Moore says that in 1991, we ""Entered Iraq, reinstated dictator of Kuwait"". This was the Gulf War, where the entire world was on our side here in a clear-cut case of aggression when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. We did bomb a little bit of Iraq in order to get Saddam to stop but this was a war started by Saddam.4. Michael Moore vastly contradicts himself by listing these ""violent acts of the United States"", and then go on to say that a country's violent history does not make it's citizens more prone to violence. Also, Michael Moore seems to correlate that on the day of Columbine was the biggest one-day bombing campaign in Kosovo, and he lets Marylin Manson say, ""Well, the president is dropping bombs...don't you think that causes violence?""So what does cause violence in America? Perhaps we will never know, and Michael Moore clearly didn't. Since Amazon requires one star, I at least will give it one of my own because this documentary is funny at times and makes interesting points. But as for Michael Moore's overall points, he does not make them at all. A very weak documentary from him, indeed.",2,Almost no sense whatsoever,1203465600,"02 20, 2008",2008,6682,"['Bowling', 'Columbine', 'attempts', 'find', 'answer', 'complex', 'question', 'why', 'do',

739526,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,B00008DDVU,T O'Brien,"[8, 16]","Bowling for Columbine is an excellent documentary by Michael Moore that discusses the issue of gun control.  Many people might not like Moore for his beliefs or the way he goes about getting his ideas to the public, me included, but there is something very thought provoking here.  Moore asks repeatedly,&quot;Why are more Americans killing each other?&quot;  He interviews countless numbers of people showing both sides of the spectrum; those for guns and those against.  This documentary does deal with a very serious subject, but Moore is able to inject humor into with his dry wit using certain camera angles and impeccable timing.  One of the most effective parts of the movie is Moore's interview with Charlton Heston, who gets caught up in his own web of excuses.  It is startling to see that Heston has no response, or not a good one, for most of Moore's questions.The Bowling for Columbine DVD is very good.  It includes numerous extras some of which are very good.  There are several interviews with Moore on different talk shows as well as an interview about Moore's controversial acceptance speech at the Oscars.  It also includes several featurettes, the theatrical trailer, and a photo gallery among many more extras.  While not everyone will agree with Michael Moore, he does know how to provoke people into thinking about subjects that they would rather not.

Continually contradictory, the common thesis that the lack of social programs in this country contribute to gun violence.Michael Moore uses sappy music, and saavy editing to pull at the heartstrings while totally disregarding facts.One such misleading fact is the number of gun murders he states.  While our gun deaths are much higher than countries like Germany, France, or Canada, it is actually smaller per capita according to FBI statistics.Also, he takes only homicides for countries like Germany and Canada, but lumps justifiable shootings (cops shooting bad guys), and accidental deaths for the United States.He blames the United State's welfare to work program for the shooting death of 8 year old Kayla Rolland by a classmate. He says the welfare to work program made the shooter's mother work, instead of stay home with her child.He fails to point out that the boy lived in a known crackhouse, where numerous weapons were readily available along with drugs and passed-out drug addicts.These are two of dozens of facts that mislead.

739529,ALN0TTRTLHA4E,B00008DDVU,"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick""","[10, 26]","America a country without a true left or even a political centre has produced one of the great populists of modern times in Michael Moore. In this documentary he investigates the reasons behind the high incidence of gun deaths by young males. He focuses on two incidents, the killings at Columbine High School and another incident in which a young boy uses his fathers gun to murder.Moore finds that the reasons for killing are not related to guns. Canada being a country which has a large rural sector has a huge rate of gun ownership but hardly any murders at all. What is the difference? The according to Moore is that Canada is a much more harmonious and peaceful society. He goes to a Canadian city and searches for the slum area but can only find well maintained comfortable public housing. He speaks to Canadians and finds that there is less fear, less conflict and less lunacy. America by contrast is not only a country with guns, it is a country in which people are scared and always on edge. The deaths and murders stem from this conflict which stems from America being a nation in which there is little investment in public infrastructure and there are huge pockets of poverty.Moore however presents this message subtlety allowing it to come out of a series of interviews and stunts. He talks to the friends of the gunmen who were responsible for the murders at Columbine. He interviews a relative of Timothy McVeigh. Those interviewed are people who are seriously weird and the fact that they have open access to gun ownership is mind boggling. He travels to Canada speaks to law enforcement officers there about issues and looks at Canadian cities. He looks at the background of the tragic young boy and what the American welfare system required of the mother.Yet for a film dealing with such a serious subject one cannot stop laughing at the brilliance in which Moore portrays the lunacy of some aspects of American society. His genius is that he can make some young gun victims look like (and they probably felt) heroes in confronting the store who sold the ammuntion which destroyed their bodies and making them withdraw it from sale. He can also turn a very old and pathetic Charlton Heston into an embodiment of evil indifference.They used to say that the Truimph of the Will was the greatest propoganda films of all time.

After I left the theater I remember my girlfriend saying that ""everyone should have to watch that movie"" and I agree for the most part. Although, I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone that took part in the Dixie Chicks CD bashing last spring.This movie takes you on a journey to find out why America is so freaking trigger happy and at no point do they come right out and say it, but you'll know by the end of the film. Moore, like a true patriot, criticizes America, it's government, it's foreign policy, and the media.At some points it seemed as though Moore was jumping all over the place, talking about American history, the weapons industry, gun laws, the media's treatment of blacks, columbine, and militias. It is apparent though that all of these topics are important in understanding the complexity of America's obsession with violence.This film has sad moments, hilarious moments, and tense moments, but it seems to be mostly a comedy until the end when Moore confronts Mr. Heston of the NRA. I was shocked at how hard Michael Moore was on Charlton Heston and it kinda gave me a bad feeling. It was a tense awkward scene that almost makes Michael seem like the bad guy. However, at the end, when he leave a picture of a little girl killed in school by a gun it reminds you that Mr. Heston's NRA was only concerned with gun rights when this girl was killed, so they held a rally near her home. I respect Mr. Moore for leaving this scene in tact instead of cutting it down to make himself look better.

739532,A2KRHLCWEBLJXM,B00008DDVU,Trevor Kroger,"[4, 7]","I'm gonna say something that doesn't get said enough -- I freakin' love Michael Moore! He's the only high-profile leftist in this country who fights. I've seen all his movies -- including Canadian Bacon -- and there's not a single moment that wasn't funny, tragic, and true all at once.So clearly I'm biased. So what? Like the one-star reviews aren't biased, or just planted by the NRA (a bunch of squishy dweebs who care more about face time than any Constitutional issue). But this one film in particular always stands out among the rest. Sicko and Farenheit 9/11 are focused on specific issues, but Bowling For Columbine is the only documentary (by anyone) that tries to get to the heart of contemporary America and explain why we keep shooting eachother.And it ain't the guns. Anyone who watches this will see pretty clearly that Moore isn't blaming gun culture -- Canada's heavily armed and they don't even bother locking their doors at night. And for anyone who figures we're just violent by nature, there's the recent history of Germany to disprove that easy explanation.So what is it really? Moore tapdances around it for most of the film but he argues (and I and Mark Ames agree) that what causes this violence is a toxic mix of bullying, paranoia, and economic misery. This stretches from the savage subcultures of high school -- and Moore actually ASKS some students what high school is like -- all the way to how our economy is structured. That last one is illustrated brilliantly by Moore showing how DoD spending is the only thing besides Wal-Mart those kids can look forward to after they graduate. Anyone who didn't want to laugh and cry at the scene with some pinhead expressing shock that kids would try to resolve their problems through violence while an ICBM is being assembled in the background either has no soul or is working for the Cato Institute.This country has some ugly truths to confront if it's ever going to stop the downward spiral to Bananastan status.

First, don't be fooled into thinking that it's an accident having &quot;Columbine&quot; in the title. It's a catch word in our vernacular now. Choosen, rightfully so, to garner attention. And the &quot;Bowling&quot; is a reference to the fact that prior to killing their fellow students and a teacher at their Columbine High School in Colorado, the teenaged killers first attended thier morning bowling class.Ultimately, this is a film about a lot of topics - the culture of violence in America, guns, television, the NRA, racism, and Mr. Moore's favorite subject - Corporate America. All these topics are explored in this very good film.Michael Moore won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature with this movie. He gave a now infamous George Bush-Scathing acceptance speech and surprised absolutely no one by doing so.However, &quot;Bowling For Columbine&quot; is not exactly a documentary. Not in the true sense of the genre. As in the past, Michael Moore's movies are a lot about Michael Moore. That is not necessarily a bad thing. I whole-heartedly recommend this feature. It's fun to watch, educational and thought provoking.What it is not, in my opinion, is a documentary.Basically, this film is an EDITORIAL about Guns In America.Mr.Moore backs up his views with a lot of information, a lot of humor and a lot of insight. This film touches on a gamut of subjects, actually - Besides simply &quot;guns are bad&quot;, he brings others topics to the proverbial table - Including racism, fear, and of course, Michael Moore's favorite topic, Corporate America. In this instance, he takes on K-Mart (in the past, his excellent film &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot; took on General Motors) and has a rather startling victory in doing so.I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone, except perhaps the true documentary fan. For those people, I would be more apt to direct them to the very excellent &quot;Capturing The Friedmans&quot; and &quot;Brother's Keeper&quot;.Documentary filmmakers, those who truly embody the genre, seldom, if ever, make themselves part of the story. They follow a story and let it unfold, presenting itself to you. Michael Moore is the story, and he takes us along for the ride.

739535,ACVLLA37BN9KY,B00008DDVU,Valjean,"[6, 13]","So many people are tied up in the politics of Michael Moore, they fail to realize that documentary is an art form.  It is an artistic means through which to examine a thesis.  I like Moore's work in general, but find the &quot;Columbine&quot; film to be sorely lacking in clarity.  In a nutshell, the film's thesis (assuming it has one) is kind of &quot;wishy-washy&quot;.  I watched the film once and kept waiting for Mike to &quot;get to the point&quot; and found that his gift for sardonically presenting bitter ironies and &quot;slapping viewers awake&quot; was wasted on subject matter that is perhaps best left in the perview of Criminologists.  Then, to see if it had any redeeming educational value, I watched it again and drew the same conclusion about the movie.  I was very disappointed.As I said, I like Moore and I will gladly rethink this review if someone can prove me wrong by telling me in a sentence or two, what *exactly* the thesis is.  Is it a statement on the state of youth of America?  Is it a statement about spoiled rich kids who kill their classmates?  Is it a statement about parents, the educational system...gun control...what...why?  Who is to blame for the terrible events in Columbine?  Alas, the film raises tons of questions, but answers none.While many people have criticized the film for pushing a political agenda related to gun control, this is perhaps Moore's most objective documentary.  People who see an &quot;anti-gun agenda&quot; in this film are just seeing what they want to see based on thier emotions about Moore.While watching Columbine, I actually got the feeling that Moore himself was uncomfortable with the grayness of the subject matter.  It's almost as if Moore was aware that a strong pro-gun control argument would put him at odds with the constitutional freedoms that he has spent the better moments of his career defending.  As a result, the film tends to branch out into too many areas (such as Militia groups, popular music, popular cultural notions about guns, etc.) leaving the viewer with a general impression that yes, we do live in a &quot;Gun Culture&quot; - but knowing this fact may or may not provide any adequate solution to the next Columbine.The result of the muddled thesis, however, might have given  Moore the appearance of &quot;neutrality&quot; that I suppose it takes to win an Oscar.  Or perhaps that was Hollywood's indirect way of acknowledging that he had deserved credit for earlier (and much better) work.  No matter, fans of Mike will acknowledge that he is better as a documentarian when his work puts him at odds with big corporations and big government.  He should stay away from the &quot;garden-variety&quot; crime issue.Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of this film is it's break away from the traditional &quot;Moore style&quot; which is laced with genuine humor and clever camera-work.  There are a few chuckles when Moore opens an savings account at a Northern Michigan bank and gets a &quot;free shotgun&quot; for his patronage, but the film is otherwise humorless.  The camera-work in the film is as sophmoric as any piece on 60 minutes.

Until I heard Moore's Oscar speech on the radio. I was amazed that anyone would dare to speak out so sharply against the Bush administration on such an event.Sadly, though, the movie was unavailable to me for a long time... Amazon's English counterpart DOES have it for sale. (Region 2).The movie is built around the shootout at the Columbine high school, where two teenagers opened fire on their fellow students. Moore wonders what possessed these two, and makes it his mission to find out why the US shows such a ridiculously high number of murders when compared to other nations such as Canada, the UK, Germany, etc.He interviews various people, ranging from NRA's chief spokes goblin Charlton Heston, relatives of the kids who got killed, victims of the Columbine shootout, and bad-boy rocker Marilyn Manson (Who is named as one source of violence in kids).As the documentary proceeds, Moore weeds out a few of the often-named arguments of why anyone would go postal. Violent movies are also watched in other countries, Marilyn Manson is also listened to in other countries, Canadians own more guns-per-capita than the US, and not just the US has a violent history.The underlying conclusion as the movie proceeds seems to be that Americans are kept in control by fear; time after time, the US Government uses the media to strike fear into it's subject's hearts. This (according to the movie) leads to the 'Shoot first, ask questions later' mentality that could in turn explain why the number of killings in the US is as high as it is.A very striking moment (in my opinion) is when Moore takes two victims to K-mart's HQ, and kindly asks them to stop selling ammo for handguns. Initially, they seem to have hit a brick wall, but when they return the day after (with more press in their tracks than Michael Jackson usually gets), a statement is made that K-mart indeed will stop selling said ammo.Moore raises some very valid points, often combined with a great touch of humour, and we can only hope that enough people will go and watch this movie. If Moore succeeds in just making ONE person reconsider taking up their gun and using it to cause death and mayhem, THAT'S when the movie REALLY proved successful.",5,"Clever 'movie', highly worth the watch.",1052956800,"05 15, 2003",2003,2311,"[""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'heard', ""'Bowling"", 'Columbine', 'Oscars', 'never', 'paid', 'much', 'notion', 'heard', 'Moore', 'Oscar', 'speech', 'radio', 'was', 'amazed', 'anyone', 'would', 'dare', 'speak', 'out', 'so', 'sharply', 'Bush', 'administration', 'event.Sadly', 'movie', 'was', 'unavailable', 'long', 'time', 'Amazon', 'English', 'counterpart', 'DOES', 'have', 'sale', 'Region', '2', '.The', 'movie', 'built', 'shootout', 'Columbine', 'high', 'school', 'where', 'two', 'teenagers', 'opened', 'fire', 'fellow', 'students', 'Moore', 'wonders', 'what', 'possessed', 'two', 'mission', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'US', 'shows', 'ridiculously', 'high', 'number', 'murders', 'when', 'compared', 'other', 'nations', 'such', 'Canada', 'UK', 'Germany', 'etc.He', 'interviews', 'various', 'people', 'ranging', 'NRA', 'chief', 'spokes', 'goblin', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'kids', 'who', 'got', 'killed', 'victims', 'Columbine', 'shootout', 'bad-boy', 'rocker', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'Who', 'named', 'one', 'source', 'violence', 'kids', '.As', 'documentary', 'proceeds', 'Moore', 'out', 'few', 'often-named', 'arguments', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'go', 'postal', 'Violent', 'movies', 'are', 'also', 'watched', 'other', 'countries', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'also', 'listened', 'other', 'countries', 'Canadians', 'own', 'more', 'guns-per-capita', 'US', 'not', 'just', 'US', 'violent', 'history.The', 'underlying', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'proceeds', 'be', 'Americans', 'are', 'kept', 'control', 'fear', 'time', 'time', 'US', 'Government', 'media', 'strike', 'fear', 'subject', 'hearts', 'according', 'movie', ""'Shoot"", 'first', 'ask', 'questions', 'later', 'mentality', 'could', 'turn', 'explain', 'why', 'number', 'killings', 'US', 'as', 'high', 'very', 'striking', 'moment', 'opinion', 'when', 'Moore', 'two', 'victims', 'K-mart', 'HQ', 'kindly', 'stop', 'selling', 'ammo', 'handguns', 'Initially', 'seem', 'have', 'hit', 'brick', 'wall', 'when', 'return', 'day', 'more', 'press', 'tracks', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'usually', 'statement', 'made', 'K-mart', 'indeed', 'will', 'stop', 'selling', 'said', 'ammo.Moore', 'very', 'valid', 'points', 'often', 'combined', 'great', 'touch', 'humour', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'enough', 'people', 'will', 'go', 'watch', 'movie', 'Moore', 'just', 'making', 'ONE', 'person', 'reconsider', 'taking', 'up', 'gun', 'using', 'cause', 'death', 'mayhem', 'THAT', 'when', 'movie', 'REALLY', 'proved', 'successful']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

As a filmmaker, he is a genius. He has a fantastic sense of humor, and knows better than anyone else, the nitty-gritties of how to use satire as a weapon. In fact, he has mastered the delicate art of sarcasm.A film about violence, `gun-violence' in particular, is not such a difficult thing to make these days, is it? It is not, but Moore's way of looking at violence and his somewhat cheeky way of presenting his views on it though, are anomalous, and Bowling For Columbine is one anomalous documentary.Bowling For Columbine completely redefines the concept of the ""Candid Camera"" form of entertainment. Catching others unguarded in their gawkiest moments, and laughing at their expense, has always been a rather seedy form of entertainment. But, Moore's way of making fools of the `wiseacres', or simply, the `ill-doers', by making a big fool of himself before them, has found a more thoughtful and productive use for the trash that is affectionately known as ""Candid Camera"".In the movie, in addition to stating the facts from his sound research-work, Moore does plentiful of `street-work', basically interviewing all kinds of people, from a school drop-out who felt insulted when his name was number-two on the `threat-list' of his school, and not number one, right up to the Hollywood `gun-possession advocating' legend, Charlton Heston, and getting all kinds of answers from them, some funny, some shocking, but all leading to the serious undertone of the movie.Moore's crazy animation byte on the `History Of America', and his disturbing presentation (amid the paradoxical background of Louis Armstrong's ""What A Wonderful world"") of why he thinks the country has always been unreasonably violent, are hilarious as well as acerbically provocative.Moore's facts may be `doctored' or questionable. But, his presentation of the supposed facts does make those who support his views, as well as those who think he is a big fat fatuous pig, ponder, talk, and have opinions. If this is so, then his job is probably fulfilled.

He blanketly compares the USA to Canada and several other countries in terms of gun murders.  He never comes right out and blames gun violence on guns, or the media, or anything else for that matter.  It is typical liberal propaganda: ask questions for which you have no answer, demonize some rednecks, some white people, talk about slavery(???), and throw in a hefty dose of guilt, and answer your own question with a bunch of ""maybe it was this,"" or ""perhaps it was this...""A few years ago my friend and I drove from Baltimore, MD to Littleton, CO and visisted the Columbine community and the high school.  It was interesting to talk to people out there about what had happened.  I think the best part of this documentary is the interview with Marilyn Manson, who by the way is rumored to be a political conservative. Manson points out the two ironic media attacks that the Columbine High School shooting brought about: going after rock music and guns.  Two things which despite Moore's deepest wishes, are simply not to blame for the crime.  Or any other crime for that matter.I gained a new respect for Moore after watching this film.  He makes some valuable points about how way mass fear has alienated people from each other and from the government in this country.

739543,A17JVVAKWEB0M,B00008DDVU,Wesley Mullins,"[3, 6]","Years from now, Michael Moore will be remembered as the filmmaker who expanded the potential a non-fiction film has to impact the cultural dialogue on certain issues. With roots in more traditional forms of documentary filmmaking (the brilliant Roger and Me), Moore jacks up his propaganda-laced form of debate in this criticism of the American gun culture.From K-Mart to Dick Clark, from South Park to Marilyn Manson, anyone even remotely associated gun violence can expect a visit from the stalking Michael Moore and his camera crew. He uses his interpretations of events and anecdotal evidence to help support his positions that target (pun intended) gun owners, manufacturers and distributors, positions that largely absolve the entertainment industry (the Marilyn Manson connection to Columbine).This film could have easily been titled &quot;Heston and Me&quot;, as much of the drama pushing the film deals with Moore's desire to interview the NRA figure-head. Unlike Roger and Me, however, this film branches off in all directions and could have benefited from a more focused editing (we really don't need all the stuff in there about health care and tax cuts). He jumps from issue to issue, causing most people to be unsure of the most important point this film offers.Even Moore supporters have a hard time suggesting he remains faithful to the truth in this film. Rather than documenting life and allowing that footage to build to a certain conclusion, Moore works backward. He begins with a premise and then sculpts and alters reality to fit his beliefs. Investigations made by watchdog groups suggest some of his strongest scenes were scripted or edited in a way to change what really happened. That would be like finding out the birds in &quot;Winged Migration&quot; were filmed in a studio, with the locations added via blue-screen technology.There is nothing inherently wrong with this form of argument (it is used by politicians, pundits and lawyers every day), but it does prevent this film from truly being a documentary. He has in fact created a new genre of film similar to a persuasive essay or Op-Ed piece. With that said, I hope people go into this film understanding it is not responsible journalism, nor is it meant to be. Moore uses his talents as a filmmaker to try to convince the world he is right on gun issues. Hopefully, his work will inspire others to create more films that tackle certain hot issues. At the very least, he is adding very entertaining (if not wholly credible) films into the American collective experience and forcing everyone to think about larger issues.",4,Strong persuasive argument...but not a documentary,1089763200,"07 14, 2004",2004,2605,"['Years', 'now', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'expanded', 'potential', 'non-fiction', 'film', 'impact', 'cultural', 'dialogue', 'certain', 'issues', 'roots', 'more', 'traditional', 'forms', 'documentary', 'filmmaking', 'brilliant', 'Roger', 'Me', 'Moore', 'up', 'propaganda-laced', 'form', 'debate', 'criticism', 'American', 'gun', 'culture.From', 'K-Mart', 'Dick', 'Clark', 'South', 'Park', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'anyone', 'even', 'remotely', 'associated', 'gun', 'violence', 'can', 'expect', 'visit', 'stalking', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'camera', 'crew', 'interpretations', 'events', 'anecdotal', 'evidence', 'help', 'support', 'positions', 'target', 'pun', 'intended', 'gun', 'owners', 'manufacturers', 'distributors', 'positions', 'largely', 'absolve', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'connection', 'Columbine', '.This', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'titled', 'quot', 'Heston', 'Me', 'quot', 'much', 'drama', 'pushing', 'film', 'deals', 'Moore', 'desire', 'interview', 'NRA', 'figure-head', 'Roger', 'Me', 'however', 'film', 'off', 'directions', 'could', 'have', 'benefited', 'more', 'focused', 'editing', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'stuff', 'health', 'care', 'tax', 'cuts', 'issue', 'issue', 'causing', 'most', 'people', 'be', 'unsure', 'most', 'important', 'point', 'film', 'offers.Even', 'Moore', 'supporters', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'suggesting', 'faithful', 'truth', 'film', 'Rather', 'documenting', 'life', 'allowing', 'footage', 'build', 'certain', 'conclusion', 'Moore', 'backward', 'premise', 'then', 'sculpts', 'alters', 'reality', 'fit', 'beliefs', 'Investigations', 'made', 'watchdog', 'groups', 'suggest', 'strongest', 'scenes', 'were', 'scripted', 'edited', 'way', 'change', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'would', 'be', 'finding', 'out', 'birds', 'quot', 'Winged', 'Migration', 'quot', 'were', 'filmed', 'studio', 'locations', 'added', 'blue-screen', 'nothing', 'inherently', 'wrong', 'form', 'argument', 'used', 'politicians', 'pundits', 'lawyers', 'day', 'prevent', 'film', 'truly', 'being', 'documentary', 'fact', 'created', 'new', 'genre', 'film', 'similar', 'persuasive', 'essay', 'Op-Ed', 'piece', 'said', 'hope', 'people', 'go', 'film', 'understanding', 'not', 'responsible', 'journalism', 'meant', 'be', 'Moore', 'talents', 'filmmaker', 'try', 'convince', 'world', 'right', 'gun', 'issues', 'Hopefully', 'work', 'will', 'inspire', 'others', 'create', 'more', 'films', 'tackle', 'certain', 'hot', 'issues', 'very', 'least', 'adding', 'very', 'entertaining', 'not', 'wholly', 'credible', 'films', 'American', 'collective', 'experience', 'forcing', 'everyone', 'think', 'larger', 'issues']",Bowling For Columbine VHS
739544,AAD2DYRK43BYF,B00008DDVU,Weston J. Kathman,"[18, 30]","I give Moore 2 stars, as opposed to 1, only because I recognize his mastery of the fictional documentary genre.  Some of what he says in this film are outright lies; for instance, the Lockheed weapons factory he visits in Colorado makes satellite missiles, not arms to be used to blow up our ""innocent"" enemies, as Moore would have us believe.  Still, his greatest gift -- if one can call it that -- is his ability to frame a story in such a way as to create a deliberately false impression without having to tell any actual lies.  A perfect example of this is the ""What a Wonderful World"" sequence in which Moore castigates America for all of the horrible, international atrocities it has committed in the last half century, while conveniently omitting the type of information that might give a more realistic account of these supposedly heinous incidents.Moore's depictions of Canada, Charlton Heston, and the NRA are likewise misleading.  Our neighbors to the North are living in a virtual crime-less utopia, if one is to buy into the claims of this film.  However, there is evidence to suggest that violent crime is actually on the rise in many areas of Canada, but I suppose it's silly of me to expect facts like this to show up in a ""documentary.""  The portrayal of Heston, on the other hand, is damn near libelous.  Yes, Heston held an NRA meeting in Colorado soon after the Columbine tragedy.  What Moore fails to inform his viewers is that this meeting had been scheduled years in advance, long before the school shooting, and that the official part of the meeting could not be cancelled due to the NRA's own by-laws.  Most of the events that had been planned in connection with this meeting were, in fact, cancelled.  Though Heston did speak at the one event that wasn't cancelled, he did not utter his famous ""from my cold dead hands"" remark in this speech, but instead delivered that gem in a speech a year later.  Moore creates the phony impression that Heston callously said this at the Colorado meeting right after the Columbine tragedy, thus revealing Heston's cold indifference to the suffering that had occurred.  As I said before, I guess I shouldn't expect the facts to get in the way of a good story, or precious propaganda for that matter.Moore's contention that the media spend a great deal of their time drumming up irrational fear is actually on target; not realizing the value of a consistent theme, though, Moore obsessively harps on American violence so much that a thoughtful viewer is likely to wonder if perhaps some of the fear being drummed up by the media isn't that irrational after all.  In the end, however, the main lessons are clear: Canada is heaven, America is hell, and Charlton Heston is Satan.",2,"Pure, Unadulterated Propaganda",1089849600,"07 15, 2004",2004,2737,"['give', 'Moore', '2', 'stars', 'opposed', '1', 'only', 'recognize', 'mastery', 'fictional', 'documentary', 'genre', 'what', 'film', 'are', 'outright', 'lies', 'instance', 'Lockheed', 'weapons', 'factory', 'Colorado', 'satellite', 'missiles', 'not', 'arms', 'be', 'used', 'blow', 'up', 'innocent', 'enemies', 'Moore', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'Still', 'greatest', 'gift', 'one', 'can', 'call', 'ability', 'frame', 'story', 'such', 'way', 'create', 'deliberately', 'false', 'impression', 'having', 'tell', 'actual', 'lies', 'perfect', 'example', 'What', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'sequence', 'Moore', 'America', 'horrible', 'international', 'atrocities', 'committed', 'last', 'half', 'century', 'conveniently', 'omitting', 'type', 'information', 'might', 'give', 'more', 'realistic', 'account', 'supposedly', 'heinous', 'incidents.Moore', 'depictions', 'Canada', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'NRA', 'are', 'likewise', 'misleading', 'neighbors', 'North', 'are', 'living', 'virtual', 'crime-less', 'utopia', 'one', 'buy', 'claims', 'film', 'However', 'evidence', 'suggest', 'violent', 'crime', 'actually', 'rise', 'many', 'areas', 'Canada', 'suppose', 'silly', 'expect', 'facts', 'show', 'up', 'documentary', 'portrayal', 'Heston', 'other', 'hand', 'damn', 'libelous', 'Yes', 'Heston', 'held', 'NRA', 'meeting', 'Colorado', 'soon', 'Columbine', 'tragedy', 'What', 'Moore', 'fails', 'inform', 'viewers', 'meeting', 'had', 'been', 'scheduled', 'years', 'advance', 'long', 'school', 'shooting', 'official', 'part', 'meeting', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'cancelled', 'due', 'NRA', 'own', 'by-laws', 'Most', 'events', 'had', 'been', 'planned', 'connection', 'meeting', 'were', 'fact', 'cancelled', 'Heston', 'did', 'speak', 'one', 'event', 'was', ""n't"", 'cancelled', 'did', 'not', 'utter', 'famous', 'cold', 'dead', 'hands', 'remark', 'speech', 'instead', 'delivered', 'gem', 'speech', 'year', 'later', 'Moore', 'phony', 'impression', 'Heston', 'callously', 'said', 'Colorado', 'meeting', 'right', 'Columbine', 'tragedy', 'thus', 'revealing', 'Heston', 'cold', 'indifference', 'suffering', 'had', 'occurred', 'said', 'guess', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'facts', 'get', 'way', 'good', 'story', 'precious', 'propaganda', 'matter.Moore', 'contention', 'media', 'spend', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'drumming', 'up', 'irrational', 'fear', 'actually', 'target', 'not', 'realizing', 'value', 'consistent', 'theme', 'though', 'Moore', 'obsessively', 'harps', 'American', 'violence', 'so', 'much', 'thoughtful', 'viewer', 'likely', 'wonder', 'perhaps', 'fear', 'being', 'drummed', 'up', 'media', ""n't"", 'irrational', 'end', 'however', 'main', 'lessons', 'are', 'clear', 'Canada', 'heaven', 'America', 'hell', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Satan']",Bowling For Columbine VHS
739545,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,B00008DDVU,William Hare,"[383, 614]","This is the fascinating story of two men from Michigan, both of whom began as hunters, and both of whom became members of the National Rifle Association.  From that point, however, their paths sharply diverged and this fascinating Academy Award-winning documentary delineates the divergent paths, leading to a dramatic meeting at the film's culmination.Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore began as an avid hunter from Michigan who joined the NRA, the same organization of which the Oscar-winning film actor Charlton Heston became president.  Moore at the film's beginning shows a determined Heston stating his solid conviction concerning the possession of guns with the words, ""from these cold dead hands.""  Moore jumps straight into the controversy in showing Heston presiding over an NRA convention the same weekend as the Columbine Disaster in Colorado, despite strong opposition from Denver's mayor and large numbers of citizens from the affected community, including parents of victims.Moore later tackles another controversy in his home town of Flint, Michigan, when Heston and the NRA met despite strong local opposition following the death of a young local child at the hands of a young boy who brought a gun to class.  Once more, the NRA and Heston went through with their plans.  An analysis of the tragedy resulted in Moore presenting some tragic but fascinating facts concerning situations which should be rectified.  The young boy's African American mother was compelled to make ends meet to catch a bus at the crack of dawn and work two jobs in another town.  One of them was at a yuppie desert parlor owned by Dick Clark, for which he received tax benefits for hiring employees who were previously on the welfare rolls.  The necessity of working two jobs in an effort to make ends meet resulted in the mother getting home late and being unable to properly supervise her child.  Moore sought to discuss the situation, who was plainly not interested and asked his driver to drive off.The fascinating film concludes with Moore receiving an interview opportunity at Heston's Coldwater Canyon mansion.  The confrontation was indeed a memorable one.This film once more solidified Moore's reputation as a daring and humanitarian filmmaker.  He is a true patriot who looks after the interests of those without the financial clout to hire lobbyists and influence presidents, governors and legislators.",5,Two Men from Michigan,1053734400,"05 24, 2003",2003,2407,"['fascinating', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'Michigan', 'whom', 'began', 'hunters', 'whom', 'became', 'members', 'National', 'Rifle', 'Association', 'point', 'however', 'paths', 'sharply', 'diverged', 'fascinating', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'documentary', 'divergent', 'paths', 'leading', 'dramatic', 'meeting', 'film', 'culmination.Documentary', 'filmmaker', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'began', 'avid', 'hunter', 'Michigan', 'who', 'joined', 'NRA', 'same', 'organization', 'Oscar-winning', 'film', 'actor', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'became', 'president', 'Moore', 'film', 'beginning', 'determined', 'Heston', 'stating', 'solid', 'conviction', 'concerning', 'possession', 'guns', 'words', 'cold', 'dead', 'hands', 'Moore', 'jumps', 'straight', 'controversy', 'showing', 'Heston', 'presiding', 'NRA', 'convention', 'same', 'weekend', 'Columbine', 'Disaster', 'Colorado', 'strong', 'opposition', 'Denver', 'mayor', 'large', 'numbers', 'citizens', 'affected', 'community', 'including', 'parents', 'victims.Moore', 'later', 'controversy', 'home', 'town', 'Flint', 'Michigan', 'when', 'Heston', 'NRA', 'met', 'strong', 'local', 'opposition', 'following', 'death', 'young', 'local', 'child', 'hands', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'brought', 'gun', 'class', 'Once', 'more', 'NRA', 'Heston', 'went', 'plans', 'analysis', 'tragedy', 'resulted', 'Moore', 'presenting', 'tragic', 'fascinating', 'facts', 'concerning', 'situations', 'should', 'be', 'rectified', 'young', 'boy', 'African', 'American', 'mother', 'was', 'compelled', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'catch', 'bus', 'crack', 'dawn', 'work', 'two', 'jobs', 'town', 'One', 'was', 'yuppie', 'desert', 'parlor', 'owned', 'Dick', 'Clark', 'received', 'tax', 'benefits', 'hiring', 'employees', 'who', 'were', 'previously', 'welfare', 'rolls', 'necessity', 'working', 'two', 'jobs', 'effort', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'resulted', 'mother', 'getting', 'home', 'late', 'being', 'unable', 'properly', 'supervise', 'child', 'Moore', 'sought', 'discuss', 'situation', 'who', 'was', 'plainly', 'not', 'interested', 'asked', 'driver', 'drive', 'off.The', 'fascinating', 'film', 'concludes', 'Moore', 'receiving', 'interview', 'opportunity', 'Heston', 'Coldwater', 'Canyon', 'mansion', 'confrontation', 'was', 'indeed', 'memorable', 'one.This', 'film', 'once', 'more', 'solidified', 'Moore', 'reputation', 'daring', 'humanitarian', 'filmmaker', 'true', 'patriot', 'who', 'interests', 'financial', 'clout', 'hire', 'lobbyists', 'influence', 'presidents', 'governors', 'legislators']",Bowling For Columbine VHS

The film is very stimulating and entertaining, and definately worth watching.  I'm only giving it three stars, however, because of some of the glaringly false/misleading statistics and poor international comparisons.  I almost fell out my chair when the film claimed that racial minorities make up the same percentage (12%) of the population in both Canada and the United States.  It should be common knowledge that Blacks and Hispanics alone make up 25% of the U.S. population.  When I visit Canada, I'm always amazed at how White it is, and most of the minorities I see there are Arab or Asian.  Also, he claims that Blacks &quot;only&quot; commit 51% of the murders in our country, but, given their percentage of the population, that hardly makes his case that race has nothing to do with our relatively high murder rates.  Then he seems to ignore the fact that more people were killed a few years ago in shootings at schools in Scotland and Germany.  This film could have been much better.
