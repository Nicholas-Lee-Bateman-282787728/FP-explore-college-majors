I couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD so I could re-live those memories. I wasn't disappointed! Although some people may think some of the special effects are a bit dated, I am not one of them.

Having originally watched all the seasons when they first aired, I would concur that Season (3) three is the best of Airwolf. This was a breakthrough type of series never seen before on TV. It is unfortunate that the star of the show Jan Michael Vincent got hooked onto Alcohol and destroyed the series and his acting career, if not himself. There are too many Hollywood and TV great actors and actresses that have succumb to the ""Bottle"" in trying to deal with the stresses in their lives that comes with stardom.

1053367,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B000N4RAQA,Taheen Lopez,"[11, 12]","I think this 1985-86 Season DVD of AIRWOLF is excellent and that this has been the best AIRWOLF DVD released yet, especially since I think the 3rd Season of AIRWOLF was the best throughout it's 3 1/2-year run as well as the most upgraded season of them all along with the fact that the Third Season of AIRWOLF was also the last and final season with the recluse Vietnam veteran Stringfellow Hawke(Jan-Michael Vincent), Hawke's one & only faithful buddy & co-pilot from 'Nam Dominic Santini(Ernest Borgnine), and their spunky co-pilot sidekick Caitlyn O'Shaunnesy(Jean Bruce Scott).It's just too bad that they didn't provide a summary with its original air-date for each episode like AIRWOLF-Season One did.For instance, the original air-dates to each of these 1985-1986 Season episodes on CBS were9/28/85-THE HORN OF PLENTY10/5/85-AIRWOLF II10/12/85-AND A CHILD SHALL LEAD10/19/85-FORTUNE TELLER10/26/85-CROSSOVER11/2/85-KINGDOM COME11/9/85-EAGLES11/16/85-ANNIE OAKLEY11/23/85-JENNIE11/30/85-THE DEADLY CIRCLE12/14/85-WHERE HAVE ALL THE CHILDREN GONE?12/21/85-HALF-PINT1/11/86-WILDFIRE1/18/86-DISCOVERY1/25/86-DAY OF JEOPARDY2/1/86-LITTLE WOLF2/8/86-DESPERATE MONDAY2/15/86-HAWKE'S RUN2/22/86-BREAK-IN AT SANTA PAULA3/15/86-THE GIRL WHO FELL FROM THE SKY3/22/86-TRACKS3/29/86-BIRDS OF PARADISEI also liked seeing David Hasselhoff's 1st wife(Catherine Hickland) on AIRWOLF in the ""Horn Of Plenty"" episode when she dances the night away with Hawke(Jan-Michael Vincent) and then entraps him, which was quite intriguing to me, especillay since I had already remembered Catherine Hickland from seeing her on KNIGHT RIDER prior to that in the ""White Bird"" episode, the ""Let It Be Me"" episode, and ""The Scent Of Roses"" episode.As a matter of fact, AIRWOLF was always shown the night after KNIGHT RIDER, since KNIGHT RIDER was part of NBC's Friday night line-up and AIRWOLF was part of CBS's Saturday night line-up at the time along with the fact that AIRWOLF was in competition with KNIGHT RIDER, despite the fact that KNIGHT RIDER got better ratings than AIRWOLF did along with the fact that AIRWOLF didn't last as long as KNIGHT RIDER either, even though AIRWOLF was more upgraded than KNIGHT RIDER in some ways, since there was hefty competition between AIRWOLF and KNIGHT RIDER, since the advantages and disadvantages between AIRWOLF and KNIGHT RIDER were quite equal.Unfortunately Jan-Michael Vincents chronic drinking problem & a nose-dive in the ratings along with the premiere of newer high-tech shows like the short-lived supercycle drama STREET HAWK led to the cancellation of this show in the Spring of 1986 around the same time KNIGHT RIDER was axed too after it became quite evident by the Winter of 1986 that this show wasn't going in the right direction since AIRWOLF & KNIGHT RIDER were both losing their touch especially when ABC had STREET HAWK made its debut on Friday January 4, 1985 which started giving viewers too much of the same thing every week & giving viewers too much competition & redundancy since AIRWOLF, STREET HAWK, & KNIGHT RIDER were all shown every weekend so close to one another since ABC had STREET HAWK on Friday nights, CBS had AIRWOLF on Saturday nights, and last, but not least NBC had KNIGHT RIDER on Sunday nights.Therefore AIRWOLF, KNIGHT RIDER, & STREET HAWK all premiered too soon after one another since KNIGHT RIDER made its debut on NBC in the Fall of 1982, AIRWOLF made its debut in the Winter of 1984, and STREET HAWK made its debut in the Winter of 1985, which was only a year after AIRWOLF premiered & only 2 1/2 years after KNIGHT RIDER premiered, but KNIGHT RIDER was still the most successful and longest running of the 3 as well as the show that got the ball rolling on these phenomenal high-tech dramas and STREET HAWK was the shortest running & least successful of the 3, despite the fact that STREET HAWK had stole KNIGHT RIDER's thunder and had overshadowed AIRWOLF & KNIGHT RIDER before STREET HAWK was given the boot by ABC when STREET HAWK hit a speed bump all of the sudden after only 9 weeks leading to its own cancellation as well.Overall, USA Network had decided to bring AIRWOLF back as a new series with new cast & crew with new characters to replace the older ones for a 4th Season by replacing Stringfellow Hawke(Jan-Michael Vincent)with String's long lost kid brother St. John Hawke(Barry Van-Dyke) after String gets hurt in a freak accident and replacing Dom(Ernest Borgnine) with Dom's niece Jo Santini(Michelle Scarabelli)to take over Santini Airlines since Dom dies off, and replacing Archangel(Alex Cord)with Anthony Sherwood, except the new AIRWOLF series tanked with even lower ratings were even lower than they were during AIRWOLF'S last 2 seasons on CBS which led to USA cancelling AIRWOLF permanently.Therefore when AIRWOLF and KNIGHT RIDER both cancelled in 1986, it was almost as if people were losing interests in high-tech shows or something and as if people lost interests in Superchoppers, Supercars, and Supercycles since people weren't impressed by the special effects on AIRWOLF or KNIGHT RIDER anymore since their competition with STREET HAWK since AIRWOLF was getting too closely related to KNIGHT RIDER & STREET HAWK which started making viewers get bored with these shows and making things a lot less impressive & a lot less convincing too.AIRWOLF's Third Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when CBS's motto was ""We've Got The Touch"", which was their slogan on CBS from the Fall of 1983 thru the Summer of 1986.It was also interesting seeing guest stars like*Eric Braeden in the ""Birds Of Paradise"" episode during his earlier co-starring days as the bitter Victor Newman on YOUNG & THE RESTLESS*Anne Lockhart in the ""Day Of Jeopardy"" episode after her co-starring days as Lt.Sheba on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA*David Hasselhoff's 1st wife(Catherine Hickland) in the ""Horn Of Plenty"" episode before her co-starring days on ALL MY CHILDREN*Stephen Parr in the ""Kingdom Come"" episode during his co-starring days on ONE LIFE TO LIVE*Todd Hodges in the ""Where Have All The Children Gone"" episode before his co-starring days on THE HOGAN FAMILY*Peter Brown in the ""Little Wolf"" episode before his co-starring days on THE BOLD & THE BEAUTIFUL and THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS*Lance LeGault in the ""Wildfires"" episode during his co-starring days as the hard-nosed Army nemesis(Col. Decker) on THE A-TEAM as Magnum's insensitive nemesis(Col. Green) on MAGNUM, P.I.*Bruce Gray in ""The Girl Who Fell From The Sky"" episode after his co-starring days on ALL MY CHILDRENThis season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when AIRWOLF was on KTLA every Monday thru Friday at 3PM during my Junior year in high school and when AIRWOLF and KNIGHT RIDER were shown every Monday thru Friday on KTLA back in the Summer of 1990 and the Summer of 1991 starting with CHiPs at 3PM, AIRWOLF at 4PM, followed by KNIGHT RIDER at 5PM and when AIRWOLF was part of KTLA's weekday afternoon line-up back in the Summer of 1992 when CHiPs was at 1PM followed by KNIGHT RIDER at 2PM and then topped off by AIRWOLF at 3PM.In fact, KTLA is now the CW affiliate for Los Angeles as well as the former WB affiliate for L.A. before the WB network was changed to the CW network.By the way, I just got word that the Shout Factory will be releasing the short-lived series STREET HAWK with Rex Smith(Jesse Mach) out on DVD on Tuesday July 13, 2010 for all you high-tech TV show fans out there.",4,Best Season Of Them All,1195430400,"11 19, 2007",2007,7455,"['think', '1985-86', 'Season', 'DVD', 'AIRWOLF', 'excellent', 'been', 'best', 'AIRWOLF', 'DVD', 'released',
