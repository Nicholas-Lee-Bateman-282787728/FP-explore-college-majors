If one chooses wisely, they can make this new format work, but if they select a less than reputable school they may face economic ruin. Why? Because the degree will never be worth what one paid for it, and this documentary does a great job of exposing which schools fall into that category. The reason these schools exist is to make a buck, and we should not forget that. However, making a dollar is not exclusive of providing a good education, and this dvd shows how.

1347319,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B003J7HOAK,Jeffery Mingo,"[4, 8]","Frontline exposes how for-profit colleges are making investors rich but might not be good for the state of education.  It notes that these schools cost four times as much as community colleges.  Recruiters may use unconscionable practices (but so does the military, so why aren't they being scrutinized?).  Further, though the students at these colleges comprise 10% of learners, they may compose 50% of student loan default.  Moreover, this problem may come at the taxpaers' expense.  These schools often spend more money on ads than on teaching.  Still, the work ends by saying there are not enough seats in traditional schools to go around.  It asks, ""Will [for-profit colleges] become 'too big to fail'?""That was all fine and good, but there's so much more that I want to know.  Do employers value alums from traditional schools more than the for-profit alums or do they not care?  Community colleges have a lot of remedial courses and let students know that they need to bone up.  Are the for-profits doing the same?  Are students actively taking tests and writing papers or does just listening to a lecturer on your computer equate to learning something?  If these companies want money, will they pass all students in all classes?  If there is homework, papers, and tests, how does the school monitor fraud?  For example, can't an MBA student pay someone with an MBA already to complete things for them?  Can they take that person's old papers and present them as original work?  Why is the Dept. of Education accrediting these schools?  Aren't the instructors at these colleges tarnishing their resumes?  Are these schools a dumping ground for the lowest-quality instructors?  This program just did not answer my questions or fears.  I'm still not sure if students at these for-profits are dupes or crafty skill-learners.",3,solely from busines angle; not what I wanted to know,1277424000,"06 25, 2010",2010,1828,"['Frontline', 'how', 'for-profit', 'colleges', 'are', 'making', 'investors', 'rich', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'state', 'education', 'schools', 'cost', 'four', 'times', 'as', 'much', 'community', 'colleges', 'Recruiters', 'may', 'use', 'unconscionable', 'practices', 'so', 'military', 'why', 'are', ""n't"", 'being', 'scrutinized', 'Further', 'students', 'colleges', 'comprise', '10', '%', 'learners', 'may', 'compose', '50', '%', 'student', 'loan', 'default', 'Moreover', 'problem', 'may', 'come', 'taxpaers', 'expense', 'schools', 'often', 'spend', 'more', 'money', 'ads', 'teaching', 'Still', 'work', 'saying', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'seats', 'traditional', 'schools', 'go', 'around', 'Will', '[', 'for-profit', 'colleges', ']', 'become', ""'too"", 'big', 'fail', 'was', 'fine', 'good', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'want', 'know', 'Do', 'employers', 'value', 'alums', 'traditional', 'schools', 'more', 'for-profit', 'alums', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'Community', 'colleges', 'have', 'lot', 'remedial', 'courses', 'let', 'students', 'know', 'need', 'bone', 'up', 'for-profits', 'doing', 'same', 'Are', 'students', 'actively', 'taking', 'tests', 'writing', 'papers', 'just', 'listening', 'lecturer', 'computer', 'equate', 'learning', 'something', 'companies', 'want', 'money', 'will', 'pass', 'students', 'classes', 'homework', 'papers', 'tests', 'how', 'school', 'monitor', 'fraud', 'example', 'ca', ""n't"", 'MBA', 'student', 'pay', 'someone', 'MBA', 'already', 'complete', 'things', 'Can', 'take', 'person', 'old', 'papers', 'present', 'original', 'work', 'Why', 'Dept', 'Education', 'accrediting', 'schools', 'Are', ""n't"", 'instructors', 'colleges', 'tarnishing', 'resumes', 'Are', 'schools', 'dumping', 'ground', 'lowest-quality', 'instructors', 'program', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'answer', 'questions', 'fears', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'students', 'for-profits', 'are', 'dupes', 'crafty', 'skill-learners']",FRONTLINE: College Inc.
1347320,A22RY8N8CNDF3A,B003J7HOAK,"Loyd E. Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[2, 2]","The bulk of this video centers around following Michael Clifford, credited with leading the first regionally accredited non-profit university to convert to a for-profit company. For-profit colleges flourish despite charging 5-6X community college rates and double university rates because community colleges and universities are not meeting the demand for higher education.The two dominant players are the University of Phoenix with almost 600,000 students in 2010 (30% drop in 2011) and EDMC (Education Management Corporation - The Art Institutes, Argosy University, Brown Mackie College, and South University) with 132,000 students. Grand Canyon University, a small Christian school, is an example of Clifford's activity - he bought and made it a for-profit, with about 40,000 current students - 90% on-line.The video does a good job of remaining neutral, yet pointing out controversial aspects of for-profit colleges. One finding is that they spend on 10 - 20% of total expenditures on teaching, and 25% on marketing. Another that they'll take about anyone, qualified or not, simply to qualify them for a government loan - the University of Phoenix has been documented enrolling homeless off the street; as a result, student default rates among for-profit colleges are far higher than traditional schools.  Still another - they spend considerable monies on lobbying Congress, eg. opposing rules that would make them more accountable for their much higher dropout and default rates. (Unfortunately, the Obama administration also needs their participation to meet its goal of substantially increasing the proportion of college graduates within the U.S. - thus creating an impediment to strict regulation.) Making the situation worse - the loans are given for any line of study - regardless of potential employability.Those looking for a non-profit college to buy prize one with accreditation - Clifford sees the process as otherwise taking ten years, about $10 million dollars, and leaving one with only a 50-50 chance of success. At least one head of an accreditation agency promises to stop giving for-profit colleges such little supervision in the future.Three more points, not included in the video. One is that Intel announced several years ago that it would cease paying for its employees to attend the University of Phoenix - concerns over high dropout rates and quality of instruction. The second - just last week 60 Minutes reported on for-profit colleges substantially misstating their graduates' 'success rates' - counting employment they already had before starting at the school. And the third - the 11/28/12 Wall St. Journal reported that student loan debt now totals almost $1 trillion, that 11% of balances were 90 or more days behind (a rate that is understated because it excludes those with deferments for being unemployed, exceeds that for credit cards and up from 8.9% in the prior quarter), and that the current level considerably exceeds the debt levels on credit cards, home equity loans, and car loans. Student loans are given for any plan of study, regardless of the likelihood of leading to the ability to repay the loan.",5,Excellent!,1353974400,"11 27, 2012",2012,3149,"['bulk', 'video', 'around', 'following', 'Michael', 'Clifford', 'credited', 'leading', 'first', 'regionally', 'accredited', 'non-profit', 'university', 'convert', 'for-profit', 'company', 'For-profit', 'colleges', 'flourish', 'charging', '5-6X', 'community', 'college', 'rates', 'double', 'university', 'rates', 'community', 'colleges', 'universities', 'are', 'not', 'meeting', 'demand', 'higher', 'education.The', 'two', 'dominant', 'players', 'are', 'University', 'Phoenix', 'almost', '600,000', 'students', '2010', '30', '%', 'drop', '2011', 'EDMC', 'Education', 'Management', 'Corporation', 'Art', 'Institutes', 'Argosy', 'University', 'Brown', 'Mackie', 'College', 'South', 'University', '132,000', 'students', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'University', 'small', 'Christian', 'school', 'example', 'Clifford', 'activity', 'bought', 'made', 'for-profit', '40,000', 'current', 'students', '90', '%', 'on-line.The', 'video', 'good', 'job', 'remaining', 'neutral', 'yet', 'pointing', 'out', 'controversial', 'aspects', 'for-profit', 'colleges', 'One', 'finding', 'spend', '10', '20', '%', 'total', 'expenditures', 'teaching', '25', '%', 'marketing', ""'ll"", 'take', 'anyone', 'qualified', 'not', 'simply', 'qualify', 'government', 'loan', 'University', 'Phoenix', 'been', 'documented', 'enrolling', 'homeless', 'street', 'result', 'student', 'default', 'rates', 'for-profit', 'colleges', 'are', 'far', 'higher', 'traditional', 'schools', 'Still', 'spend', 'considerable', 'monies', 'lobbying', 'Congress', 'eg', 'opposing', 'rules', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'accountable', 'much', 'higher', 'dropout', 'default', 'rates', 'Unfortunately', 'Obama', 'administration', 'also', 'participation', 'meet', 'goal', 'substantially', 'increasing', 'proportion', 'college', 'graduates', 'U.S.', 'thus', 'creating', 'impediment', 'strict', 'regulation', 'Making', 'situation', 'worse', 'loans', 'are', 'given', 'line', 'study', 'regardless', 'potential', 'employability.Those', 'looking', 'non-profit', 'college', 'buy', 'prize', 'one', 'accreditation', 'Clifford', 'process', 'otherwise', 'taking', 'ten', 'years', 'about', '10', 'million', 'dollars', 'leaving', 'one', 'only', '50-50', 'chance', 'success', 'least', 'one', 'head', 'accreditation', 'agency', 'stop', 'giving', 'for-profit', 'colleges', 'such', 'little', 'supervision', 'future.Three', 'more', 'points', 'not', 'included', 'video', 'One', 'Intel', 'announced', 'several', 'years', 'would', 'cease', 'paying', 'employees', 'attend', 'University', 'Phoenix', 'concerns', 'high', 'dropout', 'rates', 'quality', 'instruction', 'second', 'just', 'last', 'week', '60', 'Minutes', 'reported', 'for-profit', 'colleges', 'substantially', 'misstating', 'graduates', ""'success"", 'rates', 'counting', 'employment', 'already', 'had', 'starting', 'school', 'third', '11/28/12', 'Wall', 'St.', 'Journal', 'reported', 'student', 'loan', 'debt', 'now', 'almost', '1', 'trillion', '11', '%', 'balances', 'were', '90', 'more', 'days', 'rate', 'understated', 'deferments', 'being', 'unemployed', 'credit', 'cards', 'up', '8.9', '%', 'prior', 'quarter', 'current', 'level', 'considerably', 'debt', 'levels', 'credit', 'cards', 'home', 'equity', 'loans', 'car', 'loans', 'Student', 'loans', 'are', 'given', 'plan', 'study', 'regardless', 'likelihood', 'leading', 'ability', 'repay', 'loan']",FRONTLINE: College Inc.

1347322,A21YJPHV31QQ92,B003J7HOAK,Mr. J. Murdock,"[1, 1]","College Inc. is a subjective look into the seedier side of the for profit college system. Both the defenders and its critics are interviewed about the merits of the for-profit educational system and, in the end, the viewer can make up their own mind about the subject. But the evidence clearly shows that for-profits have very little value; is unaccredited, which means these credits don't transfer to state colleges; has a poor quality education and often times costs far more to attend these colleges than it does a state college and a community college; and the quality of the education is often times very questionable. For instance, three nursing students Martha, Nora and Susan went to the for-profit Everest College. They never set foot in a hospital during their time there and their education mainly consisted of learning about The Church of Scientology's Evils of Psychiatry. Another sad case is of one Ann Cobb, a 35-year old divorced woman, who is knee deep in $60,000 in student loans and only makes $8,000 a year on food stamps. Even after graduating, she still hasn't been able to find a job and can't pay off her loans.Other problems with the for-profits are pressure tactics used by recruiters to get as many people to sign up. The more people they get to sign up the more money they make so they sign just about any person off of the street without discriminating whether this person is a worthwhile college student. I would recommend this film to any and all students who are thinking about going to a for-profit and urge them to reconsider it. If a students defaults on their loans, the federal government will hound them until it is all paid back and it can't be discharged in bankruptcy. The man who expanded the for-profit and made it what it is today, Michael Clifford, never went to college, has a past history of cocaine and marijuana abuse and converted to Christianity to show what a humanitarian he is.

I always heard there were colleges that were just for profit and now I know which ones are.I will never go to these schools: Phoenix, Devry, ITT, Everest, and so on. Mainly because most of those schools are ""NOT Accredited"" schools. They teach you things on the job, but top employers want students that came from accredited schools. If you just want to work for some small no name place, you might have a chance there, but it's not a sure thing either.I found that colleges that you heard the most about online and on TV commercials are the colleges all for profits school. Hmm... why is that? Well, because they are for profit and just like other big business companies this is the best way to advertise and get more customers. It doesn't mean they care about you though, once they got your money, you are left to fend for yourself.Those schools care about one thing, money, money, and more money! Don't ever contact these schools, if you want help finding an actual job. As for as they are concerned, they taught you the skills and if you can't find a job, tough luck!Also, if you contact the school just to asks about their program and say no to joining, it is not the end of the story.
