Halle Berry should not have been in this movie, simply because we know her tooo well as the beautiful, half-white, Halle.  We, the viewers, cannot get past that she is Halle, and her acting is not as profound to convince us otherwise.  Sorry.Billy Bob, however is excellent in which ever role he stars in.  He is gifted, although he deserves roles that can truly bring out his ability to depict memorable characters; this role was simple.Don't even ask WHY she won an academy award.  Was it for that overexaggerated nude sex scene where she practically rapes Billy Bob???  Or maybe it was her OTHER scene where she attacks her obese son.What was excellent in this movie was the soundscore!  The music was eerie, and appropo to the scenes.  In the DVD is an explanation of how instruments were used.Also on the DVD is ""Deleted Scenes.""  Why do DVD producers put in deleted scenes???  They confuse the issue.And the best part about a DVD collection is commentary!  This is always important, to have good commentary!Simple plot:  a black woman falls in love with a racist ex-prison guard who participated in her husband's deathrow execution.  Peter Boyle whose most recent fame is ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" plays his also racist ex-prison guard aging father.  Simple.  Nothing else happens!

Not only does she continue to redefine beauty, she redefines acting in her portrayal of a woman at a crossroads.While the film focuses mostly on one man's struggle with the life assigned him and his relationship with his father and son, Halle's character, Leticia, must deal with her own heartache.  She finds herself redefining who she after a two significant losses in her life.When life deals her a very heavy blow she turns to a man who was kind to her and an intense relationship begins.  While the editorial review speaks of the loss of children - it is how those deaths happen that bring about the bond.  It's an exquisitely written film, expertly directed, and beautifully acted by all!  Heath Ledger (one of my favorites) turns in a great performance (while I loved him in A Knights Tale, I didn't think he had it in him and now I am hooked!...) as Hank's son and the dynamic intensity between them leaves you bewildered and angry too.This is a movie well worth watching.

The only reason why this movie was a big deal and the reason why Halle Barry won an Oscar is because of the explicit sex scene between Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton.I have to say I am really dissapointed in Halle Berry for doing that unnecessary sex scene. They did not have to go that far to get the point across. I haven't respected her the same since. Most women starting out in their acting careers do scenes like that to get ahead. Halle Berry was already well established and respected. She didn't need to do that kind of a scene.Besides that one scene, the reason I didn't really care for this movie is because I felt that the characters were not well established. I did not feel a connection with them. Also I thought Halle Berry's acting was not that great or believable. I felt she overacted.

689679,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005YU1M,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","We all know that I love depressing, and I love dark depictions of human suffering.  I love to have my emotional core tapped, drained even, but harsh realities of humanity in its rawest form.  This very year (2001, the year in question) was dominated in my eyes by the very bleak and very raw `In the Bedroom', a film that tapped into the most brutal depictions of grief and loss and vengeance I've ever seen on film.  It may be concluded that, since I am so incredibly head-over-heals in love with `In the Bedroom' that my sentiments would be mirrored for the equally bleak and maybe ever more gritty depiction of depression `Monster's Ball'.The issue I have with this film is that it is uneven and forced.Don't get me wrong; there are many facets of this film that work brilliantly.  For the most part the acting is very strong and the script, while definitely brutal (almost to a fault) is written with a layer of depth that makes the overwhelming feel forgivable.  My complaint here is that the film could have been something truly remarkable if it had found its footing without resorting to complete and total devastation.  I like my depressing, but there comes a point within a film where you sink so low that you cannot fathom a resolution.The thing is, `Monster's Ball' isn't the kind of film that requires that absolute lowness.The film revolves around the unlikely romance between a prison guard named Hank and a single mother named Leticia.  Hank is a white borderline racist (he's more conditioned that way by an oppressive father than truly headstrong in that conviction) who happens to have a part in the execution of Leticia's husband, Lawrence.  Leticia has a lot of things wrong with her life.  She is struggling financially to take care of an overweight child she views as a burden, until he is hit by a car and killed and she realizes how empty she is on her own.  She strikes up a drunken fling with Hank that leads to a mutual bonding over the loss of family (Hank's tormented son Sonny recently took his own life) that is tested by the truths behind Hanks' involvement in Lawrence's execution, not to mention Hank's father's outlandish racism.The film is shot in a very grainy almost yellow overtone (an aspect of the film I absolutely adore) that gives you an instant sense of misery and emptiness.  The performances by the cast elevate this mood.  Heath Ledger deserves `best in show' mentions for his BRILLIANT supporting performance (cameo if you will) as Sonny.  He evokes such pure emotional response to the situation, the line of work weighing in on his conscience and the emotional weight of his background and apparent emptiness crushing down on him.  Billy Bob Thornton takes that same emotional deterioration and muddies it a bit to elongate the performance.  He is essentially the same character, but Sonny's fatal explosion really makes his performance pop.  Thornton is just as marvelous (in my opinion) just in a different way.I thought the Peter Boyle was serviceable in a caricature that really only simplified the films promise and took it down a notch.This brings me to Halle Berry (OSCAR winner Halle Berry).  I admit, when she won I cheered.  It was such a milestone and her acceptance speech was SO heartfelt and beautiful and just mesmerizing.  Even if I felt that a few of her fellow nominees were more deserving (Kidman, Zellweger, Spacek) her win made me very happy.  That said, her performance is quite uneven and actually sets the tone for the film itself being uneven.  She manages to nail quite a few scenes, but she comes off desperate in some, unsure in others, and this takes away from the character.  Her quieter scenes tend to work better than her loud ones, but even in those she has moments where she almost seems forcibly subtle, as if she has been studying over actress's quiet depictions of grief and trying to emulate.  In her louder moments she comes across manic and desperate and overreaching for attention.  Sometimes it works (that drunk scene, regardless of what some say, was flawless) and other times it just doesn't (the scene where she attacks her kid seemed overreaching for me).  I love her and am happy for her and for her `moment', but in all honesty one cannot consider this a fully realized and deserving performance.The films grittiness is almost to a fault in that it layers on the darkness without backing it up with a real sense of inner depth.  Where it tries to make a statement on the legal systems death penalty, it misses the mark that the masterful `Dead Man Walking' hit.  Where it attempts to connect with the effects of instilled racism, it misses the mark that films like `American History X' really connected to.  Where it makes strides towards the grief and guilt ridden depiction of a parent outliving a child, it misses the mark that `In the Bedroom' completely nailed.It has a lot of avenues it tries to cover but it lacks the finesse to cover each one thoroughly.  It is a worthy viewing, but it doesn't reach the perfection that it could have found with a tighter script and a little more tailoring of Berry's performance.That said; the final scene on the front porch stairs with Hank and Leticia is the perfect way to end and still haunts me today.",3,It tries to handle far too much and comes off rather desperate and uneven...,1258675200,"11 20,

There are some (unintentionally?) amusing lines, such as the prostitute who asks  'How's Sonny?' to Billy Bob's character, just before he is about to make the funky chicken with her. Sonny has just shot himself, in front of Billy Bob, and his grandad.Second half drags out even longer than the the last 10 minutes of A.I., though without that film's biting realism. Only problem is that this is the main theme of the film - Halle Berry's character falling for an unspeakable racist type (Billy Bob). With every minute the plot unfolds from this point, the holes in the 'plot' become more and more glaring, and the eventual happy ending is at little more than laughable. Berry's sex scene is one of the least erotic images on celluloid, and her performance overall is mesmerisingly bland and unconvincing.Perhaps I watched this with overly high expectations - having enjoyed BB's performances in SlingBlade etc., and with knowledge of Berry's Oscar-winning performance. But, like A.I, it is a huge disappointment, despite some interesting moments.If you want something entertaining, but thought provoking, I recommend 'Buffalo 66', 'Brazil', or 'Dead Man Walking'.

Made for a paltry 4 or 5 million dollars, the movie shines with rare performances and heart-wrenching emotional situations too often avoided in the more demographically correct films produced by Hollywood insiders. Seems like all the best work has most recently been done outside official movie-making channels.As with other recent independent films, the cast in this film is both star-studded and superb. From Peter Boyle to Billy Bob Thornton to Halle Berry, not a bad word can be uttered. All of their performances are outstanding, and the film develops into an incredible tour-de-force for Berry as she gives us a veritable busman's tour of a whole panoply of human passions and emotions, ranging from oozing and undulating sexuality on the one extreme to abject despondency on the other. This is a role virtually guaranteed to showcase her acting abilities, as it certainly did. Her raw talent to emote and take the camera hostage to her incredible acting powers is breathtaking to observe, and she shows us the stuff that won her the Oscar hands down.The subject matter makes this film more appropriate for more mature viewers, as it is a bit too real and too candid about more adult mattes to be bandied about with younger viewers. Moreover, its rather cynical and depressing look at the more serious side of life makes it a must see film, one that shows us the treasure we now have in actors like Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton.

It is a tough, disturbing film that will no doubt be disliked by many. Look at the poor reviews for that. It is not the kind of movie that you can watch again, or even have an easy, good time watching it for the first time. It is not an enjoyable, entertaining experience. It is not supposed to be. Some people just don't get that. Billy Bob Thornton stars as Hank, a corrections officer down south. He has a strained relationship with his son Sonny(Heath Ledger), and a crothety old father(Wonderfully done by Peter Boyle). When we meet Hank, he is getting ready to put to death a man(Sean Combs AKA P.Diddy). We soon learn that Hank and his father are racist people. The elder one being even nastier. In comes Leticia Musgrove(Hallee Berry), the widow of the just executed man. She has a son and is struggling to make ends meet. Thru an accident that happens, she winds up meeting Hank. Before long, her and Hank strike up an unlikely friendship. ...Hank begins having a change of heart(which is a little far fetched that it happened so quickly and easily). This new union is likely to have trouble in it's future, and it does, in the form of Hank's father. The movie is directed very well. It gets the mood and the town right. It feels bleak and depressing, like the lives of our characters. Then there are the actors. Billy Bob is always good. Always real. He is one of the best we got working today. He makes interesting choices. He always makes them believeable. Hank is no exception. Wonderfully played. Hallee is a woman who won the Oscar and was deserving of it. There have been some not so nice comments about that. Whatever. She did a remarkable job. She made Leticia a human being. When she was down on her luck and depressed, we felt it. We saw it. It was real. She was great. Her winning the Oscar just being about politics is a bunch of bull. ...  Now, I can say that she is a wonderful, competent actress. Peter Boyle is very effective. Never before have you seen Peter Boyle like this. This will make you look at him on ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" very differently. Extremely good. Heath Ledger has a rather small role, but he does the best with what he's got. Too bad he didn't have more. Sean Combs is not P. Diddy here. He does a good, respectful job here. He has a shot at a film career if he wants one. The sex scene is graphic and raw. It's off-putting. It's the most real and raw sex scene I've ever seen(and there haven't been many)this side of an X rating. It didn't alter my opinion on Hallee one bit. When you've lost everything and your in a dead zone, who knows what you would do. You know?. This movie is based on a tough subject matter. It's not for everyone and it isn't easy to watch. It shouldn't be judged by your thoughts on Hallee, the Oscar win, or the plot of the movie. It's a well written, directed, and acted movie, and it deserves to be seen as such. The only problem I had with this movie was the ending. I am not quite sure what happened there. It could've been better. So, in the end, it's a powerful film with powerful performances, but not for everyone.

689690,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005YU1M,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","Monster's Ball is a pretty interesting drama.  Basically it's about Billy Bob Thorton and Halle Berry having their own separate sets of problems (some of which are major and life-changing) and eventually, they come together one magical evening.  The timing of the two coming together is fantastic and makes you think it was meant to happen.So much storyline is devoted to building up family-related problems between the two characters WELL before the two of them actually meet.  It's wonderful when storytelling is precisely thought out and executed with such ease (thanks to Billy Bob Thorton and Halle Berry being top-notch actors and actresses of course).On top of this, there's definitely a moral that you should accept people despite their skin color, and that issue is addressed in compelling, detailed and dramatic fashion (especially near the end involving a segment with Billy Bob's father and Halle Berry).  Let's just say, it's emotionally devastating, and given the nature of the father, not the least bit surprising.Now what makes Monster's Ball actually enjoyable are the many emotional changes that occur along the way.  These moments contain an interesting set of circumstances that occasionally leads to a tragic outcome and most surprising is that the two scenes I'm thinking of are NOT related to racism.

Despite the slow pace and storyline development, you definitely don't want to walk out of the room and potentially miss a key moment of storytelling.

Monster's Ball is a difficult & fun film to review. Halle Berry - while mesmerizing to look at - is downright bizarre as she's hitting her fat child and screaming about his obesity. Her svelte figure next to his rotund one is a study in contrasts unbefitting of the time, place and situation of this story...but then what are the time, place and situation of this story? When she is ranting and raving before giving herself to Billy Bob in the moment of despair- errr, I mean passion - was this the moment that clenched the Oscar? Do women who look like Berry (or any women for that matter) really sleep naked when their son is in the next room and no one else is in the house? No wonder he was cramming chocolate bars down his throat.Billy Bob Thornton is disturbing and entertaining as the offbeat racist turned master-hero of political correctness. His performance in this film seems a microcosm of his actual transformation from southern good ole' boy to Hollywood darling. Ribs to tofu can happen in two hours!!! The only problem is that if you're actually from the South, you'll have trouble figuring out what Billy Bob is all about. At times he is convincing and almost enjoyable in his role as a perplexed, jaded I-don't-know-what.  At others you are left wondering if he is the long lost love child of Ned Beatty's interlude in the woods from you-know-where.Whoever cast Heath Ledger must have thought that his muffled grunt would suppress any Australian and successfully pass for effective Southern twang, not to mention that genetically he's not too convincing as Billy Bob's son... Strange scenes like him callously banging in the hotel room and vomiting in the hallway make it seem like he detested every moment of the picture ... I don't blame him...The music is haunting and mysterious while the camera work does at times evoke wonder.Halle Berry does transfix, but not always in a good way in this film. She seems far more convincing shopping for the hat than pawning the ring.Billy Bob seemed on the verge of laughter, especially in the Oscar stealing performance of his co-star as she again waxes non-poetic about her son's obesity...then segues with no subtlety to sexual moans!?! ...at least don't try to pass this off as aphrodisiac/foreplay.And then the sex scene made me want to vomit. Alas, Heath beat me to it.I cannot decide if this film was intended to be satire, parody or sincere drama. I felt guilty while laughing at it.

The circumstance that brings together the central romance is clearly meant to devastate the audience and bring them to tears, but all it does is disappoint.(...)By the end of the film, the audience is perplexed as to whether or not they were meant to believe in the characters, or dislike them. Every twist imaginable occurs, most of which are quite predictible. The only noteable thing are the performances.And what performances they are! With a film like this, poor performances would have destroyed any impact the film could have earned, but everyone here is at the top of their game, from Oscar winning Halle Berry to the critically ignored Heath Ledger, giving a career high performance. But how can anyone mention Ledter when the two leading actors - Billy Bob Thornthon and Berry - are so strong and appealing. I have to admit that I had been rooting for Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge the year Ms. Berry won for this, but after seeing the film, it was a well-earned award.

In this film, Thornton and his son (Heath Ledger) are the death row guards for Halle Berry's husband who is about to be executed. Far from that execution's being the main event of the movie, it serves to set off a chain reaction of events that show the two characters, played by Thornton and Berry, in depth as human beings with multi facets. Each of them has a son and each could be called a bad parent. Each has a scene with his/her respective son that will take you way past any comfort zone. Then, there's Thornton's relationship with his father, played by Peter Boyle, a truly despicable man. With all these jagged edges, it is surprising that the movie is at heart a relationship movie about Thornton and Berry as a couple and not a film about death row or parents and sons. Berry is outstanding and certainly did an Oscar worthy performance. The only other film I've seen her in is ""Swordfish"". Many people might not even guess that this is the same actress. As for Thornton, he is that rarity, a triple or quadruple threat talent: he can act (comedy and drama equally), write (The Gift and Slingblade), direct, sing, drum. I guess the only question is, Can He Dance? If he can't, give him a few lessons and I'm sure we'll see him in a Fred Astaire remake next.",5,Last 12 Months a Tour de Force by Thornton,1025308800,"06 29, 2002",2002,1768,"['knew', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'was', 'talented', 'when', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'starred', 'wrote', 'directed', 'Little', 'did', 'suspect', 'was', 'hiding', 'talent', 'such', 'range', 'semi', 'appearance', 'last', '12', 'months', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'reinvent', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'who', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'really', 'Bandits', 'Man', 'Who', 'Was', ""n't"", 'name', 'two', 'boy', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'difficult', 'even', 'potentially', 'hateful', 'role', 'film', 'Thornton', 'son', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'are', 'death', 'row', 'guards', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'husband', 'who', 'be', 'executed', 'Far', 'execution', 'being', 'main', 'event', 'movie', 'set', 'off', 'chain', 'reaction', 'events', 'show', 'two', 'characters', 'played', 'Thornton', 'Berry', 'depth', 'human', 'beings', 'multi', 'facets', 'son', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'bad', 'parent', 'scene', 'his/her', 'respective', 'son', 'will', 'take', 'way', 'comfort', 'zone', 'Then', 'Thornton', 'relationship', 'father', 'played', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'truly', 'despicable', 'man', 'jagged', 'edges', 'surprising', 'movie', 'heart', 'relationship', 'movie', 'Thornton', 'Berry', 'couple', 'not', 'film', 'death', 'row', 'parents', 'sons', 'Berry', 'outstanding', 'certainly', 'did', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performance', 'only', 'other', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Swordfish', 'Many', 'people', 'might', 'not', 'even', 'guess', 'same', 'actress', 'Thornton', 'rarity', 'triple', 'quadruple', 'threat', 'talent', 'can', 'act', 'comedy', 'drama', 'equally', 'write', 'Gift', 'Slingblade', 'direct', 'sing', 'drum', 'guess', 'only', 'question', 'Can', 'Dance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'few', 'lessons', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'remake', 'next']",Monster's Ball

689705,A1ERZIZ48CBCSB,B00005YU1M,Charismatic Creature,"[12, 24]","A very, very overrated movie. In retrospect, I think Halle Berry --a beautiful and talented actress -- should have gotten an Oscar, but not for this role. She is utterly miscast as a down-and-out waitress whose husband is executed and whose grotesquely fat little boy is run over by a car. Sorry folks, but there is no way, no how, in no universe that a woman who looks like Halle would ever be in this situation. This is the ""trap"" many gorgeous starlettes find themselves in....they want to play serious parts, but their looks make a serious part as a poor waitress or lowlife impossible to believe. (Think of Michelle Pfieffer in ""Frankie and Johnnie"".) With her gorgeous face (even sans makeup), stunning body, delicate Caucasian-looking facial features and perfectly straight hair, she does not look like the average African American woman, let alone one living in wretched poverty in the Deep South. She looks like what she is  -- a beautiful movie star! This alone makes this psuedo-naturalistic movie a kind of bad joke.Billy Bob Thornton is fine as the bigoted prison guard who falls in love with a black woman and undergoes a big personal transformation, but the role isn't much of a stretch for him. He's very low key in the part, which is OK but not special. Peter Boyle is kinda reprising his ""Everbody Loves Raymond"" role, only in a particularly malevolent way.  I do have to say I feel a lot of doubts about the film's message that the surly old man is best off bundled away in a crummy nursing home, than living with his son...this certainly doesn't send a pro-family, pro-social responsibility message for a film that is supposed to be so upright.The only big surprise here to me was Heath Ledger. I thought of him mostly as a one-note, teen heartthrob with good looks but little talent. He was surprisingly good here, sensitive and even touching. A lot of energy goes out of the film after his suicide. I think the film might have worked better if it had been his character, Sonny, who had bonded with a local African American woman, rather than his father's. Sonny is the one presented as being more open and less predjudiced than the two older men.Lastly, the ""big sex scene"". Way overrated. You will be disappointed. It's a bit more graphic than the usual under-the-sheets, wearing underwear sex scenes you get in some movies, but it's ABSOLUTELY NOT PORN, despite some comments on this site. If anything, it's rather grim and depressing.  The characters just seem sad and energyless, and so is the sex -- graphic but joyless, not sensual and no one really seems to be having a good time.Kinda like the audience.",2,"Very overrated, not that sexy, kinda dull",1076544000,"02 12, 2004",2004,2633,"['very', 'very', 'overrated', 'movie', 'retrospect', 'think', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'actress', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'Oscar', 'not', 'role', 'utterly', 'miscast', 'down-and-out', 'waitress', 'husband', 'executed', 'grotesquely', 'fat', 'little', 'boy', 'run', 'over', 'car', 'Sorry', 'folks', 'way', 'how', 'universe', 'woman', 'who', 'Halle', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'situation', 'trap', 'many', 'gorgeous', 'starlettes', 'find', '.they', 'want', 'play', 'serious', 'parts', 'looks', 'make', 'serious', 'part', 'poor', 'waitress', 'lowlife', 'impossible', 'believe', 'Think', 'Michelle', 'Pfieffer', 'Frankie', 'Johnnie', 'gorgeous', 'face', 'even', 'makeup', 'stunning', 'body', 'delicate', 'Caucasian-looking', 'facial', 'features', 'perfectly', 'straight', 'hair', 'not', 'look', 'average', 'African', 'American', 'woman', 'let', 'alone', 'one', 'living', 'wretched', 'poverty', 'Deep', 'South', 'what', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'star', 'alone', 'psuedo-naturalistic', 'movie', 'kind', 'bad', 'joke.Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'fine', 'bigoted', 'prison', 'guard', 'who', 'love', 'black', 'woman', 'big', 'personal', 'transformation', 'role', ""n't"", 'much', 'stretch', 'very', 'low', 'key', 'part', 'OK', 'not', 'special', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'kinda', 'reprising', 'Everbody', 'Raymond', 'role', 'only', 'particularly', 'malevolent', 'way', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'feel', 'lot', 'doubts', 'film', 'message', 'surly', 'old', 'man', 'best', 'off', 'bundled', 'away', 'crummy', 'nursing', 'home', 'living', 'son', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'send', 'pro-family', 'pro-social', 'responsibility', 'message', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'so', 'upright.The', 'only', 'big', 'surprise', 'here', 'was', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'thought', 'mostly', 'one-note', 'teen', 'heartthrob', 'good', 'looks', 'little', 'talent', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'here', 'sensitive', 'even', 'touching', 'lot', 'energy', 'film', 'suicide', 'think', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'character', 'Sonny', 'who', 'had', 'bonded', 'local', 'African', 'American', 'woman', 'rather', 'father', 'Sonny', 'one', 'presented', 'being', 'more', 'open', 'less', 'predjudiced', 'two', 'older', 'men.Lastly', 'big', 'sex', 'scene', 'Way', 'overrated', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'bit', 'more', 'graphic', 'usual', 'under-the-sheets', 'wearing', 'underwear', 'sex', 'scenes', 'get', 'movies', 'ABSOLUTELY', 'NOT', 'PORN', 'comments', 'site', 'anything', 'rather', 'grim', 'depressing', 'characters', 'just', 'seem', 'sad', 'energyless', 'so', 'sex', 'graphic', 'joyless', 'not', 'sensual', 'one', 'really', 'be', 'having', 'good', 'time.Kinda', 'audience']",Monster's Ball
689706,A1SP8O6N9XT2ME,B00005YU1M,C,"[3, 4]","I do understand the criticisms that people have put against this film. The sex scenes are explicit, but I feel they are justified. Yes, Leticia (Halle Berry) had been mourning the death of her son and this makes it distinctly uncomfortable viewing. However, in times such as these, the human spirit turns to basic wants, whether comfort eating or sexual pleasure. The difference is not that vast.The reason I applaud this film so highly is not so much for the acting, as this has been widely admired, but for the directing and the film in general. Things happen suddenly in this film and they often seem random. The end does not tie up neatly. But this, this strange ambiguity is what makes the film so real. Things do occur in life which are random or seem by chance (whether truly random or not is down to your personal belief) - like Hank being the one who passes Leticia and her son in the road, things do not tie up neatly, often you make decisions which are strange but perhaps necessary for you, like Leticia's choice to remain with Hank at the end. Having said that, this is left slightly uncertain and perhaps she does not stay with him.Neither of the two main characters are perfect. Leticia abuses her child, and Hank is a racist bigot. Once again, this makes the film more true to life - nobody is perfect. I did not personally really sympathise with either of the characters, but it almost didn't matter as the story was still worth telling.The film made me feel very much an observer, not someone drawn into the film - again this struck me as a sign of truly magnificent directing making this story true to life - you can never be inside someone else's story. You can only observe and emphathise with their story through your own experience, which is precisely what this film makes you do.People have criticised the implausibility of the sudden love between the two main characters. However, I want to point out that the characters do not at any point say that they love each other, and their relationship seems more a product of mutual need. I think this is realistic - two people in difficult situations, not necessarily in love but keeping each other company. Company is often vastly underrated. I feel this is a film about company in the worst situations.",4,Astonishly real.,1102809600,"12 12, 2004",2004,2273,"['do', 'understand', 'criticisms', 'people', 'have', 'put', 'film', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'explicit', 'feel', 'are', 'justified', 'Yes', 'Leticia', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'had', 'been', 'mourning', 'death', 'son', 'distinctly', 'uncomfortable', 'viewing', 'However', 'times', 'such', 'human', 'spirit', 'basic', 'comfort', 'eating', 'sexual', 'pleasure', 'difference', 'not', 'vast.The', 'reason', 'applaud', 'film', 'so', 'highly', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'acting', 'been', 'widely', 'admired', 'directing', 'film', 'general', 'Things', 'happen', 'suddenly', 'film', 'often', 'seem', 'random', 'end', 'not', 'tie', 'up', 'neatly', 'strange', 'ambiguity', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'real', 'Things', 'do', 'occur', 'life', 'are', 'random', 'seem', 'chance', 'truly', 'random', 'not', 'down', 'personal', 'belief', 'Hank', 'being', 'one', 'who', 'Leticia', 'son', 'road', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'tie', 'up', 'neatly', 'often', 'make', 'decisions', 'are', 'strange', 'perhaps', 'necessary', 'Leticia', 'choice', 'remain', 'Hank', 'end', 'Having', 'said', 'left', 'slightly', 'uncertain', 'perhaps', 'not', 'stay', 'him.Neither', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'perfect', 'Leticia', 'child', 'Hank', 'racist', 'bigot', 'Once', 'again', 'film', 'more', 'true', 'life', 'nobody', 'perfect', 'did', 'not', 'personally', 'really', 'sympathise', 'characters', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'story', 'was', 'still', 'worth', 'telling.The', 'film', 'made', 'feel', 'very', 'much', 'observer', 'not', 'someone', 'drawn', 'film', 'again', 'struck', 'sign', 'truly', 'magnificent', 'directing', 'making', 'story', 'true', 'life', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'someone', 'else', 'story', 'can', 'only', 'observe', 'emphathise', 'story', 'own', 'experience', 'precisely', 'what', 'film', 'do.People', 'have', 'criticised', 'implausibility', 'sudden', 'love', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'However', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'point', 'say', 'love', 'other', 'relationship', 'more', 'product', 'mutual', 'need', 'think', 'realistic', 'two', 'people', 'difficult', 'situations', 'not', 'necessarily', 'love', 'keeping', 'other', 'company', 'Company', 'often', 'vastly', 'underrated', 'feel', 'film', 'company', 'worst', 'situations']",Monster's Ball

Hank (Billy Bob Thornton), is a prison guard who is working on Death Row. At first, Hank doesn't seem to like blacks, but that all changes when a black man (Sean ""P.Diddy"" Combs) is put to death. He has a strained relationship with his son, Sonny (Heath Ledger) who also works as a Death Row prison guard at the same prison, and elderly father. It turns out that the black man who was put to death was the husband of Leticia (Hallie Berry), a black woman who works as a waitress at the restuarant Hank always goes to at the end of the day. After Sonny committs suicide because he feels his father doesn't love him, Hank quits the prison guard job and opens up a gas station. During all of this, Hank comes across Leticia who is also suffering from the loss of her husband and the death of her child who was hit by a car. They unexpectedly fall in love, and learn to live with their losses and each other.Great performances from the entire cast...especially Hallie Berry; she deserved the Oscar.

MacNeil ""Chris M""","[7, 8]","Halle Berrie's accomplishment as the first African-American to win a Best Actress Oscar may have eclipsed the substance of this film, and that may be unfortunate to some extent. Here, Berrie's character of Leticia Musgrove is about to become widowed by way of her husband's execution by the Georgia Department of Corrections. In its wake, Leticia is drawn to Billy Bob Thornton's character of Hank Grotowski, a correctional officer who assists in the execution. Their attraction is strengthened but strained on both personal and social levels by the deaths of their respective children. What follows for both is an uncertain journey that evokes questions about racism, the inequities of the criminal justice system and the South's unspoken social disdain for interacial coupling. Director Marc Forster could easily have doomed his film to being another unremarkable social commentary but manages a stellar but unsettling film of substance with incredible character development. Neither Berrie nor Thornton's characters elicit much sympathy at film's start, but we actually come to feel some empathy for their lost souls and get some hope for their redemption in the film's last line, from Thornton: ""I think we're gonna be alright."" Not only is ""Monster's Ball"" difficult to watch, it's wrenching, and some scenes may actually shock, especially the one in which Berrie physically abuses her son for being overweight. In the end, though, Berrie does emerge from some kind of moral ambiguity to try to begin anew, and her performance is truly astonishing. But Thornton is no less so, and he is simply riveting! Here, he gives us yet another dimension of his obviously multi-faceted talent, and we come to feel nothing but empathy and respect for his character. More than a anti-comment on social and racial inequities, ""Monster's Ball"" makes that comment all the more powerful by giving us characters of incredible realism.",4,"Societal, human emotions at their most raw",1047945600,"03 18, 2003",2003,1921,"['Halle', 'Berrie', 'accomplishment', 'first', 'African-American', 'win', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'may', 'have', 'eclipsed', 'substance', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'unfortunate', 'extent', 'Here', 'Berrie', 'character', 'Leticia', 'Musgrove', 'become', 'widowed', 'way', 'husband', 'execution', 'Georgia', 'Department', 'Corrections', 'wake', 'Leticia', 'drawn', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'character', 'Hank', 'Grotowski', 'correctional', 'officer', 'who', 'execution', 'attraction', 'strengthened', 'strained', 'personal', 'social', 'levels', 'deaths', 'respective', 'children', 'What', 'uncertain', 'journey', 'questions', 'racism', 'inequities', 'criminal', 'justice', 'system', 'South', 'unspoken', 'social', 'disdain', 'interacial', 'coupling', 'Director', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'doomed', 'film', 'being', 'unremarkable', 'social', 'commentary', 'stellar', 'unsettling', 'film', 'substance', 'incredible', 'character', 'development', 'Berrie', 'Thornton', 'characters', 'elicit', 'much', 'sympathy', 'film', 'start', 'actually', 'come', 'feel', 'empathy', 'lost', 'souls', 'get', 'hope', 'redemption', 'film', 'last', 'line', 'Thornton', 'think', ""'re"", 'gon', 'be', 'alright', 'Not', 'only', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'difficult', 'watch', 'wrenching', 'scenes', 'may', 'actually', 'shock', 'especially', 'one', 'Berrie', 'physically', 'son', 'being', 'overweight', 'end', 'Berrie', 'emerge', 'kind', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'try', 'begin', 'anew', 'performance', 'truly', 'astonishing', 'Thornton', 'less', 'so', 'simply', 'riveting', 'Here', 'yet', 'dimension', 'obviously', 'multi-faceted', 'talent', 'come', 'feel', 'nothing', 'empathy', 'respect', 'character', 'More', 'anti-comment', 'social', 'racial', 'inequities', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'comment', 'more', 'powerful', 'giving', 'characters', 'incredible', 'realism']",Monster's Ball

689711,A7A1VNPVK4FLB,B00005YU1M,"""cinemajunkie""","[10, 20]","Honestly, I'm not a big fan of anti-racism films because they're all pretty much the same.  Not to mention this is the most horrible one yet.Billy Bob Thornton plays a Police Officer working on Death Row, who has recently put a black man to death.  He later meets the man's widow, a black waitress played by Halle Berry.  The two begin to develop a romantic relationship and Thornton's racism is put to the test.Like most anti-racism films, this one had potential to be a good movie.  However, everything in it is so flawed it wasn't even worth my time.  First of all, the sex scene.  I don't mind sex scenes in films, but is it really necessary to have it that long and graphic?  I got the point after the first time.  It just made the scene more and more uninteresting as it went along.  The entire rest of the film is filled with a loathable supporting cast, most notably Peter Boyle, who plays Billy Bob Thornton's extremely racist father.  Now, if you're going to have unlikable characters in a film, they can't just be braindead hicks!The rest of the film's problems lies in its overbearing screenplay which left me thinking, ""What is the point in all this?""  That racism is bad?  If you're going to tell me that, which I really don't need to be told in the first place, tell it to me well.  Don't just throw a bunch of grotesque images onto the screen and expected me to care.The one good thing about this movie is the surprisingly watchable performance given by Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs.  All the other performances are mostly forgettable (Halle Berry was NOT Oscar-worthy), which is surprising, considering there are such good actors in it.  If all you care to see is Halle Berry's breasts, then you will probably like this film.

Not just any stranger...but a racist white man who helped execute her husband.  Leticia (Berry) is struggling to keep her family alive, with no help from her inmate husband on death row.  She works a dead end job to feed her obese son and in her eyes, it all seems pointless...like her life is going nowhere.  When her husband is executed and a freak accident causes her the loss of her son she's thrown into an almost unwilling relationship with Hank (Thorton) a racist warden at the prison her husband was killed in.  Their relationship is strange to each other, and they want it almost as much as they're afraid of it, and it's the fear that I feel makes them want it even more.  This film has strong performances with an even stronger life lesson tagged on.  Sometimes we think we know ourselves, but with the snap of your fingers your can find that you never knew yourself at all.  I was so happy to see Halle take home the oscar and I hope to see her tackle more roles that challenge her and prove that this was not a fluke.  Look for strong performances by Heath Ledger (this is the film that persuaded Ang Lee to cast Heath in Brokeback Mountain) as well as Peter Boil who is so evil you loathe him long after the credits are done rolling.

For instance, Halle Berry, I feel despite winning the Oscar for her performance here, was miscast--she seems too beautiful and glamorous to convince me that she's an impoverished Southern black woman.  Also the film seems to be under-written, I would've like to have more information about the relationship between her and the convict husband (Sean Combs, this film seemed to me to be more about Billy Bob's character than about her. Also the ending left me unresolved like that's it!?  No sudden explosion from her when she realizes the secret that Billy Bob has been carrying with him all this time.

Both are haunted by the loss of their beloved ones and draws on emotional solace through intense sexual communication. The tragedy unfolds in the town of Southern Georgia where racial discrimination is rampant - and the flawed characters reflect silently the dysfunctional society through their mannerism and attitude. Leticia castigates her obese son to shed his weight to prove ""blacks are not a disgrace""; Hank is tortured in a rigid families where obligations conflicts with a strained father-and-son relationship. They meet under a twist of fate - and their romance is at once tenuous and fragile with the hidden truths...MONSTER'S BALL would not have been such a triumph if not for the strength of the versatile Billy Bob Thornton who injects subdued grief and sensitivity to the character, where Hank matures under the harsh lessons and eradicates his racism to translate his yearning for love and passion. Halle Berry in what may be her most explosive and visceral performance yet as the dignified Leticia, elevates the emotional core of the love-story. Their heated sex is a vent for their frustration and injustice done to them. Supporting cast including Heath Ledger as Hank's suppressed son and Peter Boyle as Hank's imperious father proves equally arresting.Yet as a movie Monster's Ball under Marc Forster's direction fails to break through of the love-story mold to enhance with symbolism and unravel the truths. It is a pity that the darkness of the surburban renders atmosphere and scenes like where their hands are intertwined behind a cage/fan to suggest deeper interpretation, yet it never succeeds to give the audience a clear meaning to that symbolism. There is lack of elaboration and thus totally left to the grounds of imagination even to the point of its inconclusive epilogue.As such, Monster's Ball is bolstered on the calibre of the seasoned ensemble to waltz the graceful tango of love and raw desperation. It is essentially a love-story when it could have been so much more as an insight on racism and character study.",4,MONSTER'S BALL is a triumph for its seasoned performance,1016755200,"03 22, 2002",2002,2223,"['miraculous', 'streak', 'destiny', 'unites', 'together', 'poverty-strickened', 'Leticia', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'execution', 'officer', 'Hank', 'Gratowski', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'inter-racial', 'romance', 'are', 'haunted', 'loss', 'beloved', 'ones', 'draws', 'emotional', 'solace', 'intense', 'sexual', 'communication', 'tragedy', 'unfolds', 'town', 'Southern', 'Georgia', 'where', 'racial', 'discrimination', 'rampant', 'flawed', 'characters', 'reflect', 'silently', 'dysfunctional', 'society', 'mannerism', 'attitude', 'Leticia', 'obese', 'son', 'shed', 'weight', 'prove', 'blacks', 'are', 'not', 'disgrace', 'Hank', 'tortured', 'rigid', 'families', 'where', 'obligations', 'strained', 'father-and-son', 'relationship', 'meet', 'twist', 'fate', 'romance', 'once', 'tenuous', 'fragile', 'hidden', 'truths', 'MONSTER', 'BALL', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'triumph', 'not', 'strength', 'versatile', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'who', 'subdued', 'grief', 'sensitivity', 'character', 'where', 'Hank', 'harsh', 'lessons', 'racism', 'translate', 'yearning', 'love', 'passion', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'explosive', 'visceral', 'performance', 'yet', 'dignified', 'Leticia', 'emotional', 'core', 'love-story', 'heated', 'sex', 'vent', 'frustration', 'injustice', 'done', 'Supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Hank', 'suppressed', 'son', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'Hank', 'imperious', 'father', 'equally', 'arresting.Yet', 'movie', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'direction', 'break', 'love-story', 'mold', 'enhance', 'symbolism', 'unravel', 'truths', 'pity', 'darkness', 'surburban', 'renders', 'atmosphere', 'scenes', 'where', 'hands', 'are', 'intertwined', 'cage/fan', 'suggest', 'deeper', 'interpretation', 'never', 'give', 'audience', 'clear', 'meaning', 'symbolism', 'lack', 'elaboration', 'thus', 'totally', 'left', 'grounds', 'imagination', 'even', 'point', 'inconclusive', 'epilogue.As', 'such', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'bolstered', 'calibre', 'seasoned', 'ensemble', 'waltz', 'graceful', 'tango', 'love', 'raw', 'desperation', 'essentially', 'love-story', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'insight', 'racism', 'character', 'study']",Monster's Ball

Sonny Grotowski (Heath Ledger), a corrections officer in the Georgia penal system is assigned to the death house the night Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs is executed. The audience will witness Combs' death, and his execution is graphic, but having witnessed it maybe we can better appreciate why the Grotowski family implodes afterward.Death row executions have been depicted before in &quot;The Green Mile&quot;, &quot;The Chamber&quot;, and &quot;Dead Man Walking.&quot;  Elements of all three of these films can be found in this film--transcendance (Green Mile); breakdown of body functions (Chamber); and the pathos of the victim (Dead Man). Yet, Monster's Ball is different. The storyline focuses on those who carry out the executions--the executioner.For the most part, the wonderful cast assembled for this film make you believe. Sean Combs may be a bit too wise and insightful for his ending but we have no idea how long he has been on death row, and perhaps like Carla Faye Tucker, he has become a better person from having faced the prospect of his own extinction. If you're opposed to the death penalty you may find yourself sickened by some of the scenes. Still, this film does not appear to be about &quot;ending the death penalty&quot; as much as it is about the effects of execution on those who must carry it out.Halle Berry's character Leticia Musgrove reminded me of Susan Sarandon's character (a waitress) in &quot;White Palace.&quot; She is a very fine actress, and I hope she is nominated for and wins the Academy Award for best actress.  Billy Bob Thorton's character Hank Grotowski is more assertive and luckier than his character in &quot;The Man Who Wasn't There.&quot;The storyline of this movie could have gone in any direction, but those who believe in the redeeming power of love and salvation through grace will not be disappointed.",4,"To see a human being, you have to be a human being",1013299200,"02 10, 2002",2002,1991,"['MONSTER', 'BALL', 'quot', 'party', 'quot', 'other', 'corrections', 'officers', 'throw', 'following', 'new', 'correction', 'officer', 'first', 'execution', 'Sonny', 'Grotowski', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'corrections', 'officer', 'Georgia', 'penal', 'system', 'assigned', 'death', 'house', 'night', 'Sean', 'quot', 'Puffy', 'quot', 'Combs', 'executed', 'audience', 'will', 'witness', 'Combs', 'death', 'execution', 'graphic', 'having', 'witnessed', 'maybe', 'can', 'better', 'appreciate', 'why', 'Grotowski', 'family', 'implodes', 'afterward.Death', 'row', 'executions', 'have', 'been', 'depicted', 'quot', 'Green', 'Mile', 'quot', 'quot', 'Chamber', 'quot', 'quot', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking.', 'quot', 'Elements', 'three', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'film', 'transcendance', 'Green', 'Mile', 'breakdown', 'body', 'functions', 'Chamber', 'pathos', 'victim', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'different', 'storyline', 'who', 'carry', 'out', 'executions', 'executioner.For', 'most', 'part', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'assembled', 'film', 'make', 'believe', 'Sean', 'Combs', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'wise', 'insightful', 'ending', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'long', 'been', 'death', 'row', 'perhaps', 'Carla', 'Faye', 'Tucker', 'become', 'better', 'person', 'having', 'faced', 'prospect', 'own', 'extinction', ""'re"", 'opposed', 'death', 'penalty', 'may', 'find', 'sickened', 'scenes', 'Still', 'film', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'quot', 'ending', 'death', 'penalty', 'quot', 'as', 'much', 'effects', 'execution', 'who', 'must', 'carry', 'out.Halle', 'Berry', 'character', 'Leticia', 'Musgrove', 'reminded', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'character', 'waitress', 'quot', 'White', 'Palace.', 'quot', 'very', 'fine', 'actress', 'hope', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'actress', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thorton', 'character', 'Hank', 'Grotowski', 'more', 'assertive', 'luckier', 'character', 'quot', 'Man', 'Who', 'Was', ""n't"", 'There.', 'quot', 'storyline', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'direction', 'who', 'believe', 'redeeming', 'power', 'love', 'salvation', 'grace', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",Monster's Ball

689728,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005YU1M,D. Litton,"[11, 15]","""Monster's Ball"" is the kind of movie that does one of two things: it either gives one the incentive to scribe thousands of pages in favor of or against its exposition, or it leaves one without a single word to put down. It operates on many different levels, addressing controversial issues that evoke a variety of emotional reactions in its well-drawn characters, and in the audience.The movie begins, oddly enough, with an execution that will bring the central characters together in a foray of tragedy and loss. We meet corrections officer Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton), the son of a retired corrections officer whose racism runs deep within his son's beliefs. Hank's own son, Sonny (Heath Ledger), suffers from his own personal demons as a result of his father's unwillingness to show him an emotional support.At the opposite end of the spectrum, Lawrence's wife, Leticia (Halle Berry), is ready for her emotional grief to come to an end, along with her husband's life. Eleven years of raising their obese son, Tyrell, and working as a waitress to make payments on their home, has burdened her into chain-smoking and drinking, In the last moments of her visit with Lawrence, all she can say is ""The only reason I'm here is so you could say goodbye to your son.""And then things change. Hank and Leticia undergo personal tragedies of which I will not speak, but will compliment due to their quiet sense of dread. It is at this point that the story takes a uniquely affecting turn, as these two needy souls find themselves drawn to one another out of a need for support, which soon develops into something much richer.We, as an audience, know there will be complications arising from their relationship, due in part to Hank's racist father, as well as a secret he keeps hidden from Leticia concerning her husband. There are two solutions to these problems, one that brims with dark comedy, one that closes the film on a note of justly deserved uncertainty, each effectively brilliant in their own way.At the center of this are two very outstanding performances from Thornton and Berry, who make their characters two of the year's most convincing. Thornton has always been a man of little words (save for his previous work in the disastrous ""Bandits""); here, he gets in touch with his ""Simple Plan"" roots by incorporating Hank with a quiet change of heart. Thornton is able to convey Hank's realization of his faults with just a few simple words, keeping the segue subtle and impacting.Berry's character, on the other hand, is more outward about her feelings, a trait that is somewhat befuddling to the conserved Hank. In perhaps the most controversial role of her career, she throws everything she has into the role of Leticia, giving us an unblinking performance that brings out the very best of her ability. In Leticia's many emotional displays and overwhelming moments of grief and pain, Berry makes us believe in the inner torments her characters must face, and comes out blazing.There are two problems I found in the film: one is its unwillingness to expand on the issue of the death penalty, the other its somewhat distanced examination of the interracial relationship between Leticia and Hank. The movie never gives us a reason to feel that there is a threat to their being together, while the execution is little more than a mere plot device used to advance the plot. Even still, ""Monster's Ball"" benefits from a realistic look at racism, as well as its examination of the changes people undergo in the wake of personal tragedy.",4,Operates on many different levels.,1015718400,"03 10, 2002",2002,3543,"['Monster', 'Ball', 'kind', 'movie', 'one', 'two', 'things', 'one', 'incentive', 'scribe', 'thousands', 'pages', 'favor', 'exposition', 'one', 'single', 'word', 'put', 'down', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'addressing', 'controversial', 'issues', 'evoke', 'variety', 'emotional', 'reactions', 'well-drawn', 'characters', 'audience.The', 'movie', 'oddly', 'enough', 'execution', 'will', 'bring', 'central', 'characters', 'together', 'foray', 'tragedy', 'loss', 'meet', 'corrections', 'officer', 'Hank', 'Grotowski', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'son', 'retired', 'corrections', 'officer', 'racism', 'deep', 'son', 'beliefs', 'Hank', 'own', 'son', 'Sonny', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'suffers', 'own', 'personal', 'demons', 'result', 'father', 'unwillingness', 'show', 'emotional', 'support.At', 'opposite', 'end', 'spectrum', 'Lawrence', 'wife', 'Leticia', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'ready', 'emotional', 'grief', 'come', 'end', 'husband', 'life', 'Eleven', 'years', 'raising', 'obese', 'son', 'Tyrell', 'working', 'waitress', 'make', 'payments', 'home', 'burdened', 'chain-smoking', 'drinking', 'last', 'moments', 'visit', 'Lawrence', 'can', 'say', 'only', 'reason', ""'m"", 'here', 'so', 'could', 'say', 'goodbye', 'son', 'then', 'things', 'change', 'Hank', 'Leticia', 'undergo', 'personal', 'tragedies', 'will', 'not', 'speak', 'will', 'compliment', 'due', 'quiet', 'sense', 'dread', 'point', 'story', 'uniquely', 'affecting', 'turn', 'two', 'needy', 'souls', 'find', 'drawn', 'one', 'out', 'need', 'support', 'soon', 'something', 'much', 'richer.We', 'audience', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'complications', 'arising', 'relationship', 'due', 'part', 'Hank', 'racist', 'father', 'as', 'well', 'secret', 'hidden', 'Leticia', 'concerning', 'husband', 'are', 'two', 'solutions', 'problems', 'one', 'dark', 'comedy', 'one', 'film', 'note', 'justly', 'deserved', 'uncertainty', 'effectively', 'brilliant', 'own', 'way.At', 'center', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Thornton', 'Berry', 'who', 'make', 'characters', 'two', 'year', 'most', 'convincing', 'Thornton', 'always', 'been', 'man', 'little', 'words', 'save', 'previous', 'work', 'disastrous', 'Bandits', 'here', 'touch', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'roots', 'incorporating', 'Hank', 'quiet', 'change', 'heart', 'Thornton', 'able', 'convey', 'Hank', 'realization', 'faults', 'just', 'few', 'simple', 'words', 'keeping', 'segue', 'subtle', 'impacting.Berry', 'character', 'other', 'hand', 'more', 'outward', 'feelings', 'trait', 'somewhat', 'befuddling', 'conserved', 'Hank', 'perhaps', 'most', 'controversial', 'role', 'career', 'everything', 'role', 'Leticia', 'giving', 'unblinking', 'performance', 'out', 'very', 'best', 'ability', 'Leticia', 'many', 'emotional', 'displays', 'overwhelming', 'moments', 'grief', 'pain', 'Berry', 'believe', 'inner', 'torments', 'characters', 'must', 'face', 'out', 'blazing.There', 'are', 'two', 'problems', 'found', 'film', 'one', 'unwillingness', 'expand', 'issue', 'death', 'penalty', 'other', 'somewhat', 'distanced', 'examination', 'interracial', 'relationship', 'Leticia', 'Hank', 'movie', 'never', 'reason', 'feel', 'threat', 'being', 'together', 'execution', 'little', 'more', 'mere', 'plot', 'device', 'used', 'advance', 'plot', 'Even', 'still', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'benefits', 'realistic', 'look', 'racism', 'as', 'well', 'examination', 'changes', 'people', 'undergo', 'wake', 'personal', 'tragedy']",Monster's Ball

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[4, 10]","If a movie is to address the complex issues of interracial relationships and existential plight, it should at least do so effectively and, more importantly, competently.  Instead, MONSTER'S BALL is a film plagued by inconsistency, bad writing, confusing plot development, and--in the case of Halle Berry--overacting that literally is embarrassing to watch.Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) is a corrections officer with a penchant for ice cream (Why doesn't this guy weigh 400 pounds?) who hates his son (Heath Ledger).  We really aren't given a reason why he hates his son, he just does.  And of course, Hank's father (Peter Boyle) is a hardline Southern bigot who says hardline bigoted things, and the only thing this family has in common is a blonde prostitute who has a most intriguing way of initiating contact with her clients.  When tragedy befalls the Grotowskis relatively early in the film, we aren't given enough information about these three characters to assess or understand what happened; we only see Hank react by quitting his job, then we see him slouch and mumble through the rest of the film.Leticia Musgrove (Halle Berry) is an irresponsible, really bad parent whose husband just happens to be on death row.  Call it &quot;random fate&quot; if you will, but Hank appears in her life just as she is trying to cope with unspeakable tragedy of her own.  Misery loves company, and apparently it also loves mumbling andmelodramatic acting on a couch (with frequent tumbles to the floor) while a mysterious hand bothers a fluttering bird inside its cage.An Andy Warhol moment.Having vigorously--athletically--consummated their relationship, MONSTER'S BALL explores the subsequent uneven actions of Hank and Leticia as their lives become more intertwined, as the script becomes goofier, as the ad libbed lines become almost laughable.

This is a bit unusual, at least to my knowledge.  Usually in Death-Row films there is some sort of recapitulation of the crime that the felon committed.  Not so here.  We're never told exactly what he did, although we're probably safe in assuming he did something more egregious than double-parking.The film takes a stab at sundry unpleasant aspects of the human condition.  We vicariously experience circumstances such as being an inmate on death row, being a corrections officer in charge of a death row inmate, being the wife of a death row inmate, losing a son, loss of employment & one's house,  growing old & feeling decrepit as well as a tinge of the horror of prejudice / racism.  In short, if you're looking for a cheery movie you may want to look elsewhere.The movie is very well done and Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton turn in remarkable performances.

His father is a classic Southern conservative redneck---ossified, miserable and misery-spreading---whose poison makes his son a casual racist and equally miserable and repressed male, who drives his own son to suicide.  At which point Thornton and Berry's paths meet (a series of fortuitous catastrophes and coincidences which slightly stretch credulity) and their relationship transforms him away from the redneck Neaderthal paradigm of his father, whom he finally puts away where he belongs---in a nursing home (ironically run by mostly black people!) so he can rot away without ruining his son's life anymore.That one night with Berry could so completely transform a man is a bit hard to swallow, as drop-dead gorgeous a woman as she is, but somehow Thornton makes us believe it's possible.  Berry finds out that Thornton is one of the men who helped execute her husband (who she no longer loved anyway) and is stunned but doesn't hold it against him.  The beautiful thing about this film is that as the camera fades out at the end, we are not subjected to the typical Hollywood cornball ending of a Big-Happy-Wedding-and-Happily-Ever-After riding off into the sunset that cheesier directors (e.g. the earlier Spielberg) would've taken.  Instead you see the two of them side by side looking up at the stars---tentatively, not completely sure of each other and where they're going, but quietly daring to hope for better days ahead, together.""Monster's Ball"" is perhaps a meditation on what has to die in order for other things to live.  Berry's husband, her semi-retarded son; Thornton's own son (his blood sacrifice) and not soon enough, his miserable and evil redneck father.  It suggests, darkly, that those things which hold us down must wither away before we can hope to fly again.Reality and American history is what it is, so if you're looking for quick-and-lazy emotional-candy/escapism then stick with the kitschy garbage that comprises the other 95% of Hollywood movies.",5,brilliant allegory of American racial history,1040860800,"12 26, 2002",2002,2360,"['film', 'should', 'be', 'shown', 'American', 'History', 'class', 'essence', 'American', 'racial/social', 'history', 'as', 'well', 'showing', 'rays', 'hope', 'better', 'future', 'American', 'race', 'relations.Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'top-notch', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'give', 'BAD', 'performance', 'man', 'who', 'electrocute', 'people', 'living', 'father', 'classic', 'Southern', 'conservative', 'redneck', '-ossified', 'miserable', 'misery-spreading', '-whose', 'poison', 'son', 'casual', 'racist', 'equally', 'miserable', 'repressed', 'male', 'who', 'own', 'son', 'suicide', 'point', 'Thornton', 'Berry', 'paths', 'meet', 'series', 'fortuitous', 'catastrophes', 'coincidences', 'slightly', 'stretch', 'credulity', 'relationship', 'away', 'redneck', 'Neaderthal', 'paradigm', 'father', 'whom', 'finally', 'away', 'where', '-in', 'nursing', 'home', 'ironically', 'run', 'mostly', 'black', 'people', 'can', 'rot', 'away', 'ruining', 'son', 'life', 'anymore.That', 'one', 'night', 'Berry', 'could', 'so', 'completely', 'transform', 'man', 'bit', 'hard', 'swallow', 'drop-dead', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'somehow', 'Thornton', 'believe', 'possible', 'Berry', 'out', 'Thornton', 'one', 'men', 'who', 'helped', 'execute', 'husband', 'who', 'no', 'longer', 'loved', 'anyway', 'stunned', ""n't"", 'hold', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'film', 'camera', 'out', 'end', 'are', 'not', 'subjected', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'cornball', 'ending', 'Big-Happy-Wedding-and-Happily-Ever-After', 'riding', 'off', 'sunset', 'cheesier', 'directors', 'e.g', 'earlier', 'Spielberg', 'would', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'Instead', 'see', 'two', 'side', 'side', 'looking', 'up', 'stars', '-tentatively', 'not', 'completely', 'sure', 'other', 'where', ""'re"", 'going', 'quietly', 'daring', 'hope', 'better', 'days', 'ahead', 'together', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'perhaps', 'meditation', 'die', 'order', 'other', 'things', 'live', 'Berry', 'husband', 'semi-retarded', 'son', 'Thornton', 'own', 'son', 'blood', 'sacrifice', 'not', 'soon', 'enough', 'miserable', 'evil', 'redneck', 'father', 'darkly', 'things', 'hold', 'down', 'must', 'wither', 'away', 'can', 'hope', 'fly', 'again.Reality', 'American', 'history', 'what', 'so', ""'re"", 'looking', 'quick-and-lazy', 'emotional-candy/escapism', 'then', 'kitschy', 'garbage', 'other', '95', '%', 'Hollywood', 'movies']",Monster's Ball

Lets get it straight-she is supposed to be playing a pore black southern woman. So I feel cheated that Hollywood casting should cast Halle Berry whose features are Caucasian if the coffee-colored skin tone is removed. Here was the time to cast a wide nosed thick lipped woman which is far from lacking in beauty. See Michelle Obama or Whooped Goldberg etc. And then there would have been a true inter-racial movie. But actually its not about a subtle racicism as much as what the stereo-typing of beauty is as projected the media. So was this all part of a cop-out by Hollywood to ensure main-stream commercial appeal?Anyway its sad,speaking as a Caucasian female myself, to see even high profile black-pride men with a pale-skinned black woman on their shoulder in too many cases.

689742,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00005YU1M,"""flickjunkie""","[9, 10]","Independent filmmaking is alive and well and evident in Monster's Ball.  This film had a minuscule $4 million budget, a terrific script and a director not afraid to take some risks.  Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry practically donated their time they were paid so little.  The result is a powerful and disturbing film that walked off with a boatload of awards, not the least of which was a best actress Oscar for Berry.Director Marc Forster conjures a forceful presentation with stark sets, next to nothing in the way of props and other set decoration, and a non existent soundtrack.  Forster does it with innovative use of the camera, sharp editing and most importantly excellent actor direction.  Forster could have done better at character development and the ending is nebulous and unsatisfying, but these shortcomings can be partially forgiven for the films many assets.This is an actors' showcase, with outstanding performances all around.  Heath Ledger makes a short but intense appearance as the son that Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) despises.  Ledger pumps the character full of repressed anger and disappointment, simultaneously resenting him and seeking his father's approval.  Peter Boyle is despicable as Hank's bigoted and self centered father.  Billy Bob Thornton delivers his best performance since ""Sling Blade"" with a complex character torn between his prejudices and his attraction to Leticia (Halle Berry).Of course the big story here is Halle Berry.  Berry shows once again that she is not just another pretty face.  I first took serious notice of her after seeing her performance in ""Introducing Dorothy Dandridge"", a little seen TV movie in which she won both a Golden Globe and an Emmy.  After that marvelous dramatic performance, I was surprised that she couldn't land roles any better than ""Swordfish"" and ""X-Men"", which tapped nothing more substantial than her looks.In this film, Berry is sexy and alluring, but these are only incidental attributes.  She displays a full range of emotions from vibrant elation and unbridled passion, to utter despondency.  She practically rips her heart out and throws it at the camera.  She can convey volumes with a single look, or come completely unglued with equal impact.  Her Oscar for this performance was richly deserved and had nothing to do with her race as so many have rationalized.  She just flat out won it going away.  As good as Nicole Kidman was in ""Moulin Rouge"", it wasn't even close.This is an excellent film that is worth seeing for the acting alone.  I rated it a 9/10.

I like Billy Bob Thornton's work, and he was at the top of his form in this movie. I also like Halle Berry's work; she was outstanding in Monster's Ball. Together as Hank and Leticia they portrayed their characters in realistic, believable detail. Hank is not a very sympathetic character in the beginning of the movie. He seems to be walking through the events in his life on auto-pilot, and there's not much room for emotional interaction in his character. Leticia seems to be getting through her life in much the same way as Hank, only Leticia is obviously holding it all together with more difficulty and with the additional help from cigarettes and the occasional drink. Where Hank's life is routine but settled insofar as his job and financial position is concerned, Leticia's life is cluttered with a number of serious problems like the execution of her husband, the probability of losing her house, a job change, and a number of other issues. She's doing the best she can with what she's got, but the strain is always present in her body language and in her face.Hank and Leticia connect when they each suffer the loss of their sons. This one circumstance forms the basis for their growing attachment to each other. As the relationship progresses, Hank becomes less the automaton and a much more sympathetic character. Leticia loses some of that tension she carries around with her like second skin. It appears they've both found a new beginning in life which neither of them would have believed could happen. But, after all, the title of this movie is Monster's Ball; reality does intrude before everyone gets too comfortable in his or her better life.It would be an oversimplification of the issues in Monster's Ball to let the explanation for the message in this film go at that. It is about racism and the implications of that mind set. It's about men and women, and how they perceive circumstances. And I think it's about who we are and the events which shape us into what we are. It is also about the interracial aspects of a relationship, and how that in itself affects not only the people in the relationship but those around them as well.I highly recommend this intelligent, thought provoking, and well done movie.",5,Excellent and Thought Provoking,1026086400,"07 8, 2002",2002,2400,"['think', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'accurately', 'racial', 'issues', 'bring', 'people', 'together', 'ones', 'divide', 'like', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'work', 'was', 'top', 'form', 'movie', 'also', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'work', 'was', 'outstanding', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'Together', 'Hank', 'Leticia', 'portrayed', 'characters', 'realistic', 'believable', 'detail', 'Hank', 'not', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'beginning', 'movie', 'be', 'walking', 'events', 'life', 'auto-pilot', 'not', 'much', 'room', 'emotional', 'interaction', 'character', 'Leticia', 'be', 'getting', 'life', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Hank', 'only', 'Leticia', 'obviously', 'holding', 'together', 'more', 'difficulty', 'additional', 'help', 'cigarettes', 'occasional', 'drink', 'Where', 'Hank', 'life', 'routine', 'settled', 'insofar', 'job', 'financial', 'position', 'concerned', 'Leticia', 'life', 'cluttered', 'number', 'serious', 'problems', 'execution', 'husband', 'probability', 'losing', 'house', 'job', 'change', 'number', 'other', 'issues', 'doing', 'best', 'can', 'what', 'got', 'strain', 'always', 'present', 'body', 'language', 'face.Hank', 'Leticia', 'connect', 'when', 'suffer', 'loss', 'sons', 'one', 'circumstance', 'basis', 'growing', 'attachment', 'other', 'relationship', 'Hank', 'less', 'automaton', 'much', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'Leticia', 'tension', 'like', 'second', 'skin', ""'ve"", 'found', 'new', 'beginning', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'believed', 'could', 'happen', 'title', 'movie', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'reality', 'intrude', 'everyone', 'too', 'comfortable', 'better', 'life.It', 'would', 'be', 'oversimplification', 'issues', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'let', 'explanation', 'message', 'film', 'go', 'racism', 'implications', 'mind', 'set', 'men', 'women', 'how', 'perceive', 'circumstances', 'think', 'who', 'are', 'events', 'shape', 'what', 'are', 'also', 'interracial', 'aspects', 'relationship', 'how', 'not', 'only', 'people', 'relationship', 'around', 'well.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'intelligent', 'thought', 'provoking', 'well', 'done', 'movie']",Monster's Ball
689747,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00005YU1M,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[7, 7]","There has been considerable negative criticism of this film, and I think it arises from the simple fact that it is not in the least what most viewers expect it to be.  Although it sports two well-known stars and expensive production values, Marc Forster's MONSTER'S BALL is essentially an art film that is unlikely to appeal to the mainstream audiences that rushed to see in the wake of Halle Berry's historic Oscar win.The story is Southern Gothic to the max, playing with grotesque plot devices worthy of Flannery O'Connor and twisted characters that might have stepped out of a Tennessee Williams play. Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) is a correctional officer with the Georgia prison system, where he works with a team that executes prisoners condemned to the electric chair. During the course of his duties, he participates in the execution of Lawrence Musgrove (Sean Combs)--an execution that, in the most unexpected way imaginable, leads to the violent death of his son (Heath Ledger.) He subsequently becomes acquainted with Lawrence's widow Leticia (Halle Berry), and when she too loses her only son (Coronji Calhoun) to violent death the two embark on a passionate affair fueled by their grief and bitterness.The film plays with a number of ideas and issues, chief among them racism, but at core it is about the emotional sterility and shallow lives of its characters, and none of them are greatly likable.  This is particularly true of the two leads, who are abusive, frustrated, and bitter--until their unexpected affair forces them to evolve in new directions.  Even so, their motives remain problematic, and the conclusion of the film offers little in the way of closure.While the plot relies on several improbable coincidences, director Forster and his actors make the most of it, and the result is a film that is truly painful in its intensity. While Halle Berry's performance has been justly celebrated, it is equaled by Billy Bob Thornton--and the supporting cast is equally remarkable. The cinematography and music is at once understated and extremely memorable, and the film as a whole has a desperate darkness that few others in recent memory have equaled.This is not a film that a great many people will like, for it creates a brooding quality that is deliberately left unresolved.  But it is a haunting film, one that lingers in the mind long after the final credits have rolled. While the DVD is expertly crafted, I found the bonus features--which include various audio tracks, outtakes, and a short on the making of the soundtrack--fairly trivial.

689752,A2PR6NXG0PA3KY,B00005YU1M,Giordano Bruno,"[4, 8]","There are two ways -- well, probably as many ways as watchers -- to view this film. First there are the time-honored conventions of epiphany through suffering and redemption through ""love"" or lust. That interpretation would take Billy Bob Thornton's sudden 'conversion' at face value, finding grounds for hope in the relationship he envisions with Halle Berry. I suspect that the logic of ""Hollywood"" demanded such an interpretation -- the closest that could be gotten to a happy ending. But a radically different point of view is more supportable, at least to me. Thornton's character is unredeemed and unredeemable. He's a 'control' monster, a narcissistic sociopath incapable of not hating. Clearly he did hate his son, and his father, so how will he strangely learn not to hate the woman whom he's effectively enslaved -- I use that word quite deliberately -- on the basis of her helplessness and his relentlessness? From that viewpoint, the film is a catastrophic tragedy. Pity that poor submissive woman! The horror in her eyes and the selfishness in his, in a moment you'll recognize when you see it, make all the stars of the Georgia night twinkle in bitter irony.This is centrally a film about racism. I can tell you that much without 'spoiling' the plot, can't I? The depiction of racism is excruciating... and realistic. There are such people, even today. Racism is America's great failure, the hateful core of a society that has always claimed ""God's favor"". ""Monster's Ball"" is also above the corrosive immorality of ""Capital Punishment"". If the film is unambiguous about anything, it's the wrongness of Capital Punishment, although that theme goes 'underground, after the first twenty minutes. Capital Punishment isn't 'wrong' because the wrong person might be slain. It's wrong because of what it does to the society that arrogantly presumes the right to kill. Thornton's father is a monster because of his presumption of having the right stuff, of not being weak like his dead wife was, of knowing who needs killing in his world. Thornton may reject that father, out of his own hunger for 'love', but he trusts in the same self-righteousness. His son, the third-generation correctional officer, can't survive in such a world of righteousness. The most human character in the film, he is inevitably the victim of Capital Punishment, murdered by his own reluctance to murder. Capital Punishment is statist murder, inseparable from all the vices of racism and a violent society. [But don't yelp at me, dear readers! I'm just explicating the film. I'd push the button on a really vile criminal -- Ollie North, for instance -- without hesitation.]Most of the one-star reviews of this already old film express outrage that Halle Berry won an Oscar for her performance in it. Me, I think she deserved it. The woman she portrays is so skittish, so defenseless, that her 'captivity' to the will of the Thornton character becomes plausible.

The time is now; the bigotries and wasted mores are eternal.  With deft assurance we come to understand a male family of Corrections officers - Peter Boyle as a gasping, respiratory failure grandfather, Billy Bob Thornton as a dutiful father who happens to be the current  active executioner, his son Heath Ledger, a sensitive young man wholly out of tune with racial bias and capital punishment.  Then there is the one to be executed, a wondrous portrayal by Sean Combs, his obese ""never make it looking like that in a Black America"" son who hides in candy bars, and  the resplendent Halle Berry as the wife/mother, victim of society in more ways then one.  The interplay of these extraordinary actors (along with a supporting cast of officers, neighbors, hookers, waitresses so strong that they each could carry a film) results in a story so deeply tender without resorting to bathos that we can only read the final credits in awe and disbelief that life, in many places, is so difficult, yet the human spirit so enduring.

I enjoyed the angles and movements.  I loved Ledger's husky southern accent, and I thought I could literally smell and taste the different sets-the diner, Berry's dirty apartment, and Thornton's tidy, musky home.The movie has many obvious metaphors that drove me crazy.

Watching the movie, I dreaded throughout that the filmmaker's were going to play things out in an obvious and predictable way. How refreshing it was to discover that they didn't.Instead, I saw a tight, economical script with an amazing performance by Halle Berry. Undoubtedly, people will nit-pick about Berry's work in the film, but beat by beat, her Leticia was one of the most physically and emotionally challenging roles of the year. For the most part, she was up to the task and clearly demonstrated that she's a serious actress. One can debate whether or not she deserved an Oscar for her work, but she definitely gave an Oscar calibre performance.Billy Bob Thornton was also deserving of an Academy Award nomination (although he didn't receive one) for his complex role as Hank. He played it honestly and fearlessly.Also of note was Mos Def's performance in the film. It was finely shaded and understated. He's definitely an actor to watch.However, despite these and other fine performanes in the film (Peter Boyle is another example), what really impressed me about this film was its script. All too often, writers seem compelled to explain every detail about a character, so that the audience ""gets it."" Fortunately, with MONSTER'S BALL, the writers assume that the audience has some level of intelligence.In this film, one gets more with just a look on a character's face than would be accomplished in ten pages of expositional dialog. The screenplay deservedly was nominated for both an Oscar as well as an Independent Spirit Award.Another thing that was refreshing about this film was that it didn't shy away from its controversial subject matter. It deals with issues of class, race, sexuality and relationships with an honesty that most filmmakers shy away from today. This of course will not sit well with the easily offended or those that refuse to believe that racism still exists in America. Given the casting of Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton in the key roles, some may not accept that the characters they played could get together romantically. Like it or not, relationships like this can and do exist and will continue to do so. If you get anything out of the film, it should be that relationships in general are spontaneous, unpredictable and often defy logic.Overall, MONSTER'S BALL is a challenging film that is often difficult to watch (and not always for the obvious reasons).

Even though the film picked up an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, the film should have had more recognition as far as Academy Awards.There are several elements about this film that needs to be brought to attention, but I wouldn't have enough room to mention all of them on this particular review.I have heard numerous people protest that this film is stupid,  that it's a waste of time, it's not worth watching, that it makes absolutely no sense, or that it is a total disappointment. - - NOT TRUE - -Some people will take another person's opinion into perspective and then accept it for granted. - - DON'T - - (at least not in this case)  Give this movie a chance.  It deserves every chance it can take.  This motion picture is proficient and it will forever in my mind remain everlasting and unforgettable.What I like best about this film is the mood changes.  Mood drastically changes as it is rolling from from beginning to end.  Now you know what they say, that it is caused by the character's overall emotions.  Yes that is true, but in this case, only partially.  The change of mood is also caused by the events that make up the plot created by the characters, the environment of the film, and, of course, the film's scoring (music).  Asche and Spencer did an outstanding, superb, and compelling job with writing, creating, and composing the music to this film.  If it hadn't have been for the music, I don't think my mind would have set so highly and clear on the movie as it did.Don't get me wrong, as I said before, every aspect of this film is wonderful.  However, if one aspect of the film is crossed out, such as the performances, it can cost the film's grasp of emotion and the film could not be as magnificent as it was or it might even be ruined.  Remember that!!!!This film may contain many adult issues, but you cannot let that statement cancel out the film as a whole.  It stands out to its potential.Finally, you can't forget the remarkable performances created by Billy Bob Thornton, Heath Ledger, Sean Combs, and especially Peter Boyle.  Their performances, along with Halle Berry and the rest of the cast ties in together to create a story about what it is like to be depressed, frustrated, cared, sensitive, and above all loved.This motion picture deserves all of the recognition it can get.

Come on! You look through the DVD extra features and beg for about a 20 minute extended ending. However, the movie will keep your attention, but its like someone with A.D.D, you seen it yet you forgot it.

After his son (Heath Ledger) messes up the last walk for a inmate on deathrow (Sean ""P-Diddy"" Combs) Hank angrily confronts him and the result ends in his son committing suicide right in front of him. The inmate who is put to death leaves his wife (Halle Berry) a widow with a young son. But after her son ends up a hit-and-run causing him to die.

Why would a young beautiful woman go for an old miserable man? She has just lost her husband, and her fat child will soon die in the film as well.Possibility #1: Race and socioeconomic status - I know, maybe it was because Halle Berry's character decided she was ""movin' on up"" and needed to get an established old white male from the community. That might be a deleted scene from the film.Possibility #2: She is a highly overexposed sexy actor in a 2002 film, and the nation wants to see her naked with another famous hollywood actor. Now most people will lie that healing racial tensions and overcoming prejudice are key issues in the story. I beg to differ with this idea of ""healing"".Taking what another reviewer said, if this were a black racist cop with a white female woman this film would have flopped...unless... you find a famous black actor and white woman. Let's say that Samuel L. Jackson is the black racist cop and Jessica Simpson is the widow. Do you think the audience would believe he truly regrets his racist ideologies? Not So. Most would understand he just wants sex from a beautiful and much younger woman. That is what this film is: a Hollywood sex show. If this film were all that great, you could change the cast members to be any person you would like and it wouldn't flaw the film. The problem is, without Billy Bob Thorton and Halle Berry, the film is about a racist white cop who gets easy sexy from a dumb black mindless widow who recovers from the loss of her husband (and her son) easily. Rate this whatever you want, but I see it as nothing more than a waste of time. Focus on something that affects your life, such as politics.

689765,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B00005YU1M,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[2, 2]","This movie tackles some very controversial topics.  It centers around two main characters.  The first is Hank Grotowski, played by Billy Bob Thornton.  Hank is a death row corrections officer at the prison.  The second character is Liticia Musgrove, played by Halle Barry.  Leticia's husband, played by Sean Combs, is scheduled to die and Hank helps conduct the execution.  After the execution, both Liticia and Hank lose their children to tragic deaths; Hank's son by suicide and Liticia's son by a hit-and-run driver.  Hank actually sees Liticia and her son along the road after the accident and he takes them to the hospitsl, but it was too late.  Afterwards, an unlikely bond forms between Hank and Liticia.Several controversial topics are brought to life in this movie.  Racism is evident throughout.  Hank's father is a hard-core racist and he makes it known to anyone he sees, including Liticia. Hank tries to distance himself from his father after meeting and ultimately falling in love with Liticia.The death penalty is also shown in the movie.  Liticia's husband is executed in the electric chair, which is hardly used as a method of capital punishment anymore.  The hardships on the family after the execution are shown, as well as their methods of coping.  Liticia's son dealt with the loss of his father by eating large amounts of candy, while Liticia drank and was evicted from their home.Finally, the relationship between Liticia, a black woman, and Hank, an older white man, was dealt with.  I think the forming of the relationship was done pretty well throughout the movie.This was a good film overall.

As such, it may hit a little too close to home for some people. It's improbable that a man and a woman in real life would experience the absurdly coincidental events these characters do, but the fact remains that many couples form a union from basic needs rather than from true love.Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Barry have both given the performances of their careers here and every time I watch this film I see why Halle won that Oscar.

We are talking deep here.""Monster's Ball"" is a look into two people lives, Hank & Leticia, and how their characters connect through the whole movie -- Her husband is executed on death row, and Hank is one of the corrections officers that assist in the execution. Sean ""Puffy"" Combs plays the husband, and he is quite impressive. The film also shows how they end up after so much tragedy is bestowed upon both of them. They both lose their sons, but in some sense, I didn't see them really grieving for their loss which is one part of their character that truly bonds them. They are both extremely complex, angry characters, and you want to have sympathy for them, but it isn't easy. As the film moves on, you start to feel for these characters.

Though Ledger appears relatively briefly, his character plays an integral role in the drama and he does a superb job.A chance encounter with deep consequences between Berry (Leticia) and Billy Bob Thornton (Hank) turns the racial divide on its ears in the modern-day south. Both have loved ones who die tragic deaths and while their connections take time to unravel, the film plays out in a masterful way with race, seduction and ultimately love playing significant parts. The understated score helps the action unfold and the coming together of Berry and Thornton are handled in an extraordinarily effective manner.With Peter Boyle playing Thronton's racist and dying father, the cast of ""Monster's Ball"" takes an inventive plot and turns it into a film full of depth and understanding.

689778,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00005YU1M,Joseph Haschka,"[134, 150]","Billy Bob Thornton already has a fine movie to his credit for the 2001 film season, THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE. He stars in MONSTER'S BALL, a film that may possibly vie with IN THE BEDROOM for multiple Oscars.Here, Thornton plays Hank Grotowski, a senior corrections officer at a prison ostensibly placed in Georgia. Hank supervises a team of officers, which includes his son Sonny (Heath Ledger), and which is assigned to carry out the electric chair execution of a black convict. (Incidentally, a ""monster's ball"" is defined as the party thrown for a prison guard before he attends at his first execution.) Living with Hank at home is his aging, physically debilitated and venomously racist father, Buck (Peter Boyle), formerly a prison guard also.The wife of the man to be executed is Leticia, played by Halle Berry. She's gamely trying to pay the rent and keep the car running by working as a waitress, and is raising an overweight son whom she sharply disciplines in an attempt to get him to stop eating everything in sight. (Leticia is convinced that fat, black men don't have a chance in America.)Both Hank and Leticia are leading separate lives of quiet - and sometimes not so quiet - desperation, each being psychologically and emotionally dragged under by circumstances and taxing personal relationships. Then, in a series of traumatic events over a short period of time, each is cut free of burdens and left, through serendipitous accident, with only each other.MONSTER'S BALL contains several volatile scenes of emotions on the rawest of edges, and which will keep the viewer riveted. Thornton and Berry both give exemplary performances as two people in unlikely company coming to grip with personal demons. As fair warning to the sensitive, the film incorporates episodes of intense sexuality.Thornton has become one of my favorite actors, and this is the first time I've seen Berry in any role. I liked this movie very much, and would be hard pressed to choose between it and IN THE BEDROOM for this year's Best Picture Academy Award.",5,Lives of desperation converge on the raw edge,1010188800,"01 5, 2002",2002,2046,"['Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'already', 'fine', 'movie', 'credit', '2001', 'film', 'season', 'THE', 'MAN', 'WHO', 'WAS', ""N'T"", 'THERE', 'MONSTER', 'BALL', 'film', 'may', 'possibly', 'vie', 'IN', 'THE', 'BEDROOM', 'multiple', 'Oscars.Here', 'Thornton', 'Hank', 'Grotowski', 'senior', 'corrections', 'officer', 'prison', 'ostensibly', 'placed', 'Georgia', 'Hank', 'team', 'officers', 'son', 'Sonny', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'assigned', 'carry', 'out', 'electric', 'chair', 'execution', 'black', 'convict', 'Incidentally', 'monster', 'ball', 'defined', 'party', 'thrown', 'prison', 'guard', 'first', 'execution', 'Living', 'Hank', 'home', 'aging', 'physically', 'debilitated', 'venomously', 'racist', 'father', 'Buck', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'formerly', 'prison', 'guard', 'also.The', 'wife', 'man', 'be', 'executed', 'Leticia', 'played', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'gamely', 'trying', 'pay', 'rent', 'keep', 'car', 'running', 'working', 'waitress', 'raising', 'overweight', 'son', 'whom', 'sharply', 'disciplines', 'attempt', 'get', 'stop', 'eating', 'everything', 'sight', 'Leticia', 'convinced', 'fat', 'black', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'chance', 'America', 'Hank', 'Leticia', 'are', 'leading', 'separate', 'lives', 'quiet', 'sometimes', 'not', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'being', 'psychologically', 'emotionally', 'dragged', 'circumstances', 'taxing', 'personal', 'relationships', 'Then', 'series', 'traumatic', 'events', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'cut', 'free', 'burdens', 'left', 'serendipitous', 'accident', 'only', 'other.MONSTER', 'BALL', 'several', 'volatile', 'scenes', 'emotions', 'rawest', 'edges', 'will', 'keep', 'viewer', 'riveted', 'Thornton', 'Berry', 'give', 'exemplary', 'performances', 'two', 'people', 'unlikely', 'company', 'coming', 'grip', 'personal', 'demons', 'fair', 'warning', 'sensitive', 'film', 'episodes', 'intense', 'sexuality.Thornton', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Berry', 'role', 'liked', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'choose', 'IN', 'THE', 'BEDROOM', 'year', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Academy', 'Award']",Monster's Ball
689779,A3SLA4ADDSYZJ2,B00005YU1M,Josh Hitchens,"[11, 15]","""Monster's Ball"" is the kind of film that very often doesn't get made. It characters are unlikable at first glance, it deals heavily with racism, death, and sex. It is a small miracle then that Marc Forster was able to deliver this very special motion picture to us.Set in the urban wasteland of the modern south, ""Monster's Ball"" at first concerns itself with the lives of Hank, played by Billy Bob Thornton, and his son Sonny, played by Heath Ledger. Father and son both work as correction officers, often in charge of administering the death penalty. Both lead empty, joyless lives, largely as the result of their bigoted upbringings. ....The acting in this film is glorious. Billy Bob Thornton creates in Hank a man who seems incapable of love, but is very vulnerable underneath his exterior of hatred. Halle Berry gives a raw and real performance as Leticia, daring to make the audience hate her. She is a bad mother and a failure, but she also has a deep well of love and a determination to survive. Heath Ledger gives a surprisingly layered performance as the hopeless Sonny. He is only on screen for a short time, but plays against type and makes Sonny a very haunted young man. Sean Combs also does well as Leticia's doomed husband, a man who has long since repented for his sins. Peter Boyle also strikes a nerve as the vulgar and bigoted father of Hank.""Monster's Ball"" does not dwell on the consequences of an interracial relationship in the South. It is an intense, heartbreakingly beautiful film that tells the uncompromised and utterly real story of two very flawed and human people who have lost everything, but somehow manage to find comfort in each other's arms. Maybe that is the most important thing about ""Monster's Ball."" Hank and Leticia never declare their love for one another. They simply feel a comfort with each other, a bond that goes beyond love. When they are together, they hurt a little less. Leticia begs Hank to ""make me feel good.""Hank and Leticia may never feel good, but at least they feel better.

This movie was called 'The Best Picture of the Year' by Roger Ebert and won Halle Berry her Oscar and had nothing but Oscar worthy material in it. Peter Boyle (of 'Everybody Loves Raymond') should've got an Oscar nomination for his raw performance as Billy Bob Thorton's father. Thorton plays Hank. Hank is a racist department of corrections officer, about to supervise the death of a black man (Sean 'Diddy' Combs) on Death Row. His son Sonny (Ledger) who disagrees with his fathers ways works beside him. After a nasty spat with his father after the man's death, Sonny commits suicide. While driving down a street one night, Hank sees a young black woman clutching her son who was just hit by a car. The woman is Leticia (Berry), the wife of the man put to death. Despite his views, Hank falls in love with Leticia who doesn't realize who Hank is. My synopsis may not be convincing enough to really convince you of how good this movie is, but I hope you see it.

Billy Bob Thronton is a state prison guard in charge of executions. His father legacy was racism. In the first scenes of the movie he uses a shotgun to make two black kids go away from his property. And he is in charge of a black man's execution in the electric chair. But the viewer is able to see that, although Billy Bob does that racist stuff, he's not very comfortable with them.Hale Berry is the wife of the condemned man. Her life is going down the drain. After her husband's death, she has to work in a cafeteria and try to raise a son with weight problems.These two troubled lives meet, and among personal problems and tragedies they try to build a life together.Billy Bob, as always, is in excelent acting shape. Hale Berry is a very beautiful woman and an amazing actress, and they both do a series of strong scenes during the movie, though some of them are a little bit extreme. The best acting in the movie, though is provided by Heath Ledger, an actor whom I thought just another one of the bunch of Freddie Prinze, etc., but who in fact is a great new talent, with a powerful yet short participation.""Monster's ball"" would have to be eight hours long to discuss correctly all the subjects in it...

Hallie gave a stunning performance and deserved the Oscar.  Billy Bob Thornton's performance was a work-of-art and I believe he also deserved an Oscar.The actors in this film are able to make you 'forget' you are watching actors create a role. You seriously get the feeling that you're watching interaction between two ordinary people living extraodrinarily painful portions of their lives and undergoing major changes in their beliefs and emotions.These performances were models of self-expression, but I have never seen that acting method better put-to-use (OK, maybe by BBT in Sling Blade, but that is a movie-unto-itself) than this touching movie.As the changes in Thornton's character begin to evolve, I found a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes for a bitter man who was metamorphosing from a rude, bottled-up, miserable human being to a kind, caring man with a lot-to-give and a need that required a great deal of filling-up. These poignant feelings were often evoked with the speaking of painfully few words, but by speaking them in just the right tone and manner BBT was able to make that transformation real and believable.Much has been made of the 'sex-scene' concerning the 'why', the 'how' it was filmed, etc.  By filming the scene through the furniture, superimposed by the fan, etc. it became a touching portrayal of two people exchanging an unexpectedly intimate moment in a beautiful and passionate manner that was obviously  unexpected and clearly new to each of them; rather than a crude, overtly gratuitous and raw-sex act.  It was more about discovery, comfort, and emotional need than about the passion of sex.While the movie may make some uncomfortable, it was very real, extremely thought-provoking, and in my mind a 'beautiful' movie.  I urge those who avoid theaters and wait for release on Video/CD to buy this film as soon it is released.  It is worth the wait you have had so far...and then some.

I initially thought it was some sci-fi movie with Halle playing an Elvira-type role. Wow, was I wrong! Instead, it's about a Southern white man named Hank (played by Billy Bob Thornton) who overcomes racism & falls in love with a black woman named Leticia (Halle's character). They each cope with the death of a son, on top of the fact that Hank, while a corrections officer, had conducted the execution of Leticia's husband. It's all so, so heartbreaking.On the downside, some scenes were quite graphic & disturbing. There's even more nudity here than in Swordfish (famous for a Halle topless scene), so this really pushes the envelope, even for an R movie. The sex scenes between Halle & Billy Bob looked so realistic that I hoped Billy Bob was wearing a condom! As for that blonde prostitute, I don't see why she needed to be in there at all.But on the upside, I loved the DVD commentary by Billy Bob, Halle & the director. Halle notes how Peter Boyle (Hank's father in the movie) is nice & hospitable in real life, yet he could play characters with totally opposite attitudes. It's sad that Billy Bob had to exit the commentary during the last 20 minutes or so, but I like Halle's comment that she wishes for a sequel, that Leticia could find herself pregnant or something. That led me to think, wouldn't it be nice indeed if those characters could not only start life anew, but start a family anew as well?Congrats to Halle on her Oscar, & remember--don't judge a movie by its title!",4,This is no sci-fi movie,1058832000,"07 22, 2003",2003,1569,"['first', 'heard', 'movie', 'when', 'got', 'news', 'Halle', 'won', 'Oscar', 'initially', 'thought', 'was', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'Halle', 'playing', 'Elvira-type', 'role', 'Wow', 'was', 'wrong', 'Instead', 'Southern', 'white', 'man', 'named', 'Hank', 'played', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'who', 'racism', 'falls', 'love', 'black', 'woman', 'named', 'Leticia', 'Halle', 'character', 'cope', 'death', 'son', 'top', 'fact', 'Hank', 'corrections', 'officer', 'had', 'conducted', 'execution', 'Leticia', 'husband', 'so', 'downside', 'scenes', 'were', 'quite', 'graphic', 'disturbing', 'even', 'more', 'nudity', 'here', 'Swordfish', 'famous', 'Halle', 'topless', 'scene', 'so', 'really', 'envelope', 'even', 'R', 'movie', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Halle', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'looked', 'so', 'realistic', 'hoped', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'was', 'wearing', 'condom', 'blonde', 'prostitute', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'needed', 'be', 'there', 'all.But', 'upside', 'loved', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Halle', 'director', 'Halle', 'how', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'Hank', 'father', 'movie', 'nice', 'hospitable', 'real', 'life', 'could', 'play', 'characters', 'totally', 'opposite', 'attitudes', 'sad', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'had', 'exit', 'commentary', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'like', 'Halle', 'comment', 'sequel', 'Leticia', 'could', 'find', 'pregnant', 'something', 'led', 'think', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'nice', 'indeed', 'characters', 'could', 'not', 'only', 'start', 'life', 'anew', 'start', 'family', 'anew', 'well', 'Congrats', 'Halle', 'Oscar', 'remember', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'movie', 'title']",Monster's Ball
689788,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B00005YU1M,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[2, 4]","Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) is a corrections officer who has always led a controlled and rather unemotional life in the modern South, a place time seems to have forgotten. Hank doesn't say much but his actions say plenty about him -the hard looks he gives his son, the unflinching way he handles the routines of his job, the racial prejudice which seems sewn to his soul.As the movie opens, Hank is about to oversee the execution of an inmate (Sean Combs). Leticia (Halley Berry) is the inmate's wife and this is the role of her career so far, one Berry plays without make-up, as a plain, hardscrabble woman who tries to make the best of her life. It was a courageous move for her to tackle this role and one that has paid off.Shortly after the execution of her husband, Leticia is faced with another tragedy and Hank arrives on the scene, reluctantly coming to her aid. Somehow, against his instincts, he finds a kindred soul in this woman and slowly, very slowly, the two form a bond - of sorts. Both Hank and Leticia have never expected much from life and they are both admittedly flawed parents. Their hurt is palpable and yet once they find each other they go forward, not dramatically, not with a clear sense of resolution or even hope but with what I can only call a will to survive and a hunger for connection - in the face of bleakness and hardship.  I would say more but I think it would be unfair to describe the revelations and surprises in this film prematurely.I will add, however, some of what I found stunning about this film. The understated, abbreviated, language and realistic worlds of  Hank and Leticia. The way small changes in each of them seem like major victories. The miracle of two such different people connecting and making something better for a time.  The need that each feels for the other, a need that overcomes a lifetime of prejudice (and it is another small miracle that their connection seems believable). The musical score which suggests the emotions behind the unspoken words in this movie.",5,Understated and haunting portrait of an unlikely pair,1024012800,"06 14, 2002",2002,2027,"['Hank', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'corrections', 'officer', 'who', 'always', 'led', 'controlled', 'rather', 'unemotional', 'life', 'modern', 'South', 'place', 'time', 'have', 'forgotten', 'Hank', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'actions', 'say', 'plenty', '-the', 'hard', 'son', 'unflinching', 'way', 'routines', 'job', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'sewn', 'soul.As', 'movie', 'Hank', 'oversee', 'execution', 'inmate', 'Sean', 'Combs', 'Leticia', 'Halley', 'Berry', 'inmate', 'wife', 'role', 'career', 'so', 'far', 'one', 'Berry', 'make-up', 'plain', 'hardscrabble', 'woman', 'who', 'make', 'best', 'life', 'was', 'courageous', 'move', 'tackle', 'role', 'one', 'paid', 'off.Shortly', 'execution', 'husband', 'Leticia', 'faced', 'tragedy', 'Hank', 'scene', 'reluctantly', 'coming', 'aid', 'Somehow', 'instincts', 'kindred', 'soul', 'woman', 'slowly', 'very', 'slowly', 'two', 'form', 'bond', 'sorts', 'Hank', 'Leticia', 'have', 'never', 'expected', 'much', 'life', 'are', 'admittedly', 'flawed', 'parents', 'hurt', 'palpable', 'yet', 'once', 'find', 'other', 'go', 'forward', 'not', 'dramatically', 'not', 'clear', 'sense', 'resolution', 'even', 'hope', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'call', 'will', 'survive', 'hunger', 'connection', 'face', 'bleakness', 'hardship', 'would', 'say', 'more', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'unfair', 'describe', 'revelations', 'surprises', 'film', 'prematurely.I', 'will', 'add', 'however', 'what', 'found', 'stunning', 'film', 'understated', 'abbreviated', 'language', 'realistic', 'worlds', 'Hank', 'Leticia', 'way', 'small', 'changes', 'seem', 'major', 'victories', 'miracle', 'two', 'such', 'different', 'people', 'connecting', 'making', 'something', 'better', 'time', 'need', 'feels', 'other', 'need', 'lifetime', 'prejudice', 'small', 'miracle', 'connection', 'believable', 'musical', 'score', 'emotions', 'unspoken', 'words', 'movie']",Monster's Ball

689792,AO461REE0KA4J,B00005YU1M,keviny01,"[5, 6]","This quiet, sedate film is a powerful observation on human emotions as well as a unique love story.  The plot is rather thread-bare, mainly concerning the gradual acceptance between a distraught widow and a prejudiced prison guard in an impoverished town.  But the payoff is tremendous.  The moment when he accepts her, and the much later moment when she accepts him (in a shining moment of acting that earns Halle Berry the Oscar), are transcendent.  The direction by Marc Forster is rather minimalist and meditative.  Dialogs are sparse and softly-spoken (this could have been a silent film).  There isn't any discourse on racialism or any social issue.  It doesn't offer any acts of heroics, any moral declaration, or any simpleminded resolution. This film is ALL about atmosphere, mood, psychological landscapes, perceptions -- things that are hard to put into words, plots, or dialogs, and can only be handled by the most skillful of filmmakers.  This is one of two types of films that usually bores the average viewer: the type that uses too much visual, aural, and editorial pyrotechnics (such as ""Citizen Kane""), and the type that uses too little.  MONSTER'S BALL is the latter, and it requires an attentive, observant viewing.  There is one graphic sex scene that quite effectively (perhaps a little too effectively) shows how the two protagonists use sex to escape from their depression.  If you like meditative films of this type, such as LEAVING LAS VEGAS, GEORGE WASHINGTON, EYES WIDE SHUT, etc., add MONSTER'S BALL to your must-see list.Two DVD versions of this film have been released.  The now-discontinued 2002 release has the R-rated version of the film and two audio commentaries (one of which features Halle Berry).  The 2003 DVD release has the director's signature on the cover, and has the unrated version of the film, but only one audio commentary -- newly recorded, but without Halle Berry.

Leticia is a woman who's had a hard life. Her husband was just executed for murder, she's too fond of sipping on liquor miniatures and she's failed as a mother to her deeply unhappy son.Any discussion about Monster's Ball eventually gets to the sex scene. Yes, it's raw. There's no romantic lighting or sex scene music. There's no attempt to make the actors look glamorous.

It's the most unerotic sex scene you've ever seen in a movie and to tell the truth, it could've been a lot shorter or skipped altogether.The movie has a couple of other flaws. Every human obstacle to the couple's relationship is conveniently done away with. Leticia's husband and son die. Hank's son dies and he packs his bigoted, foul mouthed father off to a black owned nursing home. In real life things don't work out this way and that was the films major hype point: it's supposed raw reality.Nonster's Ball is not as controversial or as great as the media makes it seem but it is a good movie.

In the aftermath, Ledger commits suicide, Calhoun is killed in a hit-and-run, and Thornton and Berry, both having lost their children, find themselves drawn together by shared catastrophe, two wounded souls clinging to each other. It's a tidy formula and one would like it to work. Berry has the flashier role and makes the most of it, earning her Oscar, despite the fact that her physical beauty takes away from her credibility as a downtrodden single mother. Thornton, though, has the more difficult job of convincing the viewer that a rigid, unfeeling white man whose emotional abuse drives his son to suicide is capable of evolving into a tender, compassionate protector of his former prisoner's widow. It's a measure of the actor's skill that he almost pulls it off.In the end, however, the film is undone by a script too full of unlikely coincidences, gratuitously prolonged sex scenes and a seriously flawed premise.

Trying to figure out who we're supposed to like is like busting a nut.  It's a very talky, very arty film. Peter Boyle is convincing as the biggoted father that gets dumped at the nursing home. Billy Bob Thornton is very interesting, particularly when he's painting his walls white. The highlight of the movie is seeing how much better his house looks after he's redecorated it. It almost doesn't look like the same house. I particularly liked how Billy Bob washes up the blood from his recliner and then from the back seat of his car. With the length and attention to detail, these clips could be used in housekeeping training films on proper cleaning techniques. The best scene in the movie is one that was cut where Thornton does his lines as the character from Sling Blade. It was also interesting to see him trying to crack up other members of the cast in the deleted scenes. Halle Berry is very emotional. Yes, she does have her husband executed, but that's not all that emotional until she sees his artwork later on. She gets pretty worked up when her son gets hit by a car. Later, she gets really steamed while tanked on her sofa with Billy Bob. While I couldn't exactly identify why she was feeling what she was, or even exactly what it was that she was feeling, she certainly felt a lot. Her performance is the reason to sit through this otherwise pretentious, slow-paced, self-obsessed piece of cinema. Heath Ledger should be noted for looking particularly bloated after his other two films. It's nice to see that even hunks can gain weight. This movie is a great curiosity piece to see why the Academy voted an Oscar.

689803,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00005YU1M,Linda Linguvic,"[32, 41]","Starring Billy Bob Thornton as Hank and Halle Berry as Leticia, this is the story is about a racist corrections officer who falls in love with the African-American widow of a man in whose execution he participated. Including the condemned man, played by Puffy Combs, three people die, and the shock of their deaths catapult the characters into a situation where chance and desperate need bring these two people together.  The film is hard to watch, especially because of the unflinching racism, words hurled in anger and rage which I, in my protected New York lifestyle, have never heard spoken aloud. And yet, none of these very flawed human beings come across as stereotypes.Billy Bob Thornton is one of the finest actors in the film world today, and his performance is nothing short of outstanding.  We hate him for his racist beliefs and yet we see a gradual humanity creep in, as he respects the last wishes of the condemned man and is infuriated by his own son, also a corrections officer, who shows weakness during the execution.  Peter Boyle is cast as Hank's father, his racism becoming stronger as he is aging and his health failing.  Throughout, he's unrepentant and represents the old and cruel way of the South.  Heath Ledger is cast as Sonny, Hank's son, a young man who is being pushed too hard to accept his father's lifestyle.  And Halle Berry, is not only pretty, but has the ability to show  complex emotion with just her eyes.  Every scene she's in is real and poignant, especially the scenes she has with her overweight son, Tyrell, played by Coronji Calhoun who is excellent in his first film role.  Together, the actors create a real and troubled world and I must say that this is one of the best casting jobs I have ever seen.Directed by a young Swiss director, Mark Forster, the original screenplay was written by Milo Addica and Will Rokos.  With less talented people, there could have been too much melodrama, but the story is told with dignity and restraint in spite of its outrageous theme. Every line of dialogue rings true.  And the cinematography of the working-class Georgia town puts the viewer right there. Wonderful in every way.

And there's more than one kind of past, too: our personal past and the larger, societal past.The larger canvas upon which ""Monster's Ball"" is painted is the modern Deep South, where race issues still seethe despite the Civil War's hundred year ago ending. Young black youths are shot at in order to get them off Billy Bob Thornton's land, because his father Peter Boyle hates blacks and doesn't want them anywhere near. Old Peter Boyle also has a nastily racist thing or two to say to Halle Berry when she innocently enters his house looking for her new boyfriend Billy Bob, who has never gotten around to mentioning that he is the corrections officer who oversaw her husband's execution.So that's the recent past that is so troublesome, too. Billy Bob would like to make a fresh start of things, especially after a Shocking Tragedy concerning his detested son. Halle has had some Harrowing Experiences lately that she too would like to forget, but just when both think they may have gotten over these things, bingo! Past Hurts swell up fresh again.Personally, I think the true Oscar contender here ought to have been Billy Bob, whose depiction of the corrections officer is fascinatingly subtle. I just never knew what he was going to do next. Halle does a LOT of screaming, whether in an emergency room or during sex it doesn't really matter. When a friend asked me about her, I said she's a lightweight actress in a heavyweight role. She still looked too glamorous to be this woman in this predicament. It would have been more daring on the movie maker's part to cast Whoopi Goldberg or another black woman who conveys having put up with a lot of unpleasantness in life.

After just a few scenes, her life is a complete disaster, but then it serendipitously intersects Thornton's and his family, which is bound for its own series of misadventures.

Berry turns in a great performance as a woman down on her luck who loses everything only to be ""rescued"" by Thornton, who is in turn trying to escape his own sad past.By the way, the title of the movie refers to the party thrown for the condemned that was a tradition in Europe, or maybe it was England.

Furthermore, we meet Heath Ledger in a part completely different from the pretty-boy-roles of his past, while Peter Boyle (whose I've always been a fan) depicts successfully Thornton's racist father.The raw, realistic and intense atmosphere of the film is also a big plus - The love scene, for which many things have been written, is a perfect example of that atmosphere.What could have probably been better:The story, describing how the tragic occurrences in the lives of two people will finally bring them together, didn't always convince me. For example, how did Thornton's character so abruptly change from a black men's hater to someone capable of loving so passionately a black woman? There are a couple of things, which I will not reveal, that attempt to explain this reversal, but still...In any case, for me, the real peak of the movie comes at the closing scene.

689812,A36EW68H08UOCS,B00005YU1M,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[8, 11]","Monster's Ball is a pretty realistic slice of a couple of pretty depressing lives, yet it ends with a similarly realistic note of optimism.Billy Bob Thornton plays Hank, a supervisor on death row at the local pen.  Sean Combs (aka P. Diddy) plays Lawrence Musgrove, an admitted ""bad man"" on that death row. Hank has a son, played by Heath Ledger, who also works at the prison, and Hank's father, played by Peter Boyle, retired from the same place.  Dad is now old and decrepit, and is a poisonous racist. Lawrence's wife, Leticia, is trying to make ends meet as a waitress while supporting their son, Tyrell.The first act ends with Lawrence's execution, and we see in that scene that Hank is deadly serious about professionalism on death row.Hank goes often to the diner where Leticia works, and they gradually strike up a casual relationship.Without giving away spoilers, disasters happen in both of their families, and they are drawn to one another in their respective grief.  This causes no small amount of conflict.  Leticia is black.  Hank's father is an extreme racist.  Hank doesn't know that Leticia is P. Diddy's widow.  Leticia doesn't know that Hank supervised her husband's execution.It's inevitable that Leticia discovers that Hank was involved in the execution.  In a different movie that might have led to a final act full of histrionics and ending in some hokey reconcilement.  In ""Monster's Ball"" this discovery is realistic and low-key.  For several moments there is no dialogue, and the scene ends with shared ice cream rather than screaming.Hank and Leticia both begin this movie with emotional baggage, and during the course of the movie, more baggage is added to both of them.  Yet at the end I felt justified hoping that things were headed in the right direction for both of them.I see several reviews for ""Monster's Ball"" complaining about how boring and bad it is.  Several of these enlightened reviewers go on to say that Halle Berry's nudity is the only reason to watch it at all.  Curious that I can't find many negative reviews without misspelled words.  On the first page alone I see the following ""difficult"" words misspelled or improperly used: ""write"", ""roll"", ""would"", ""makes"".My point is that I see ""criticism"" divided pretty evenly - those who have difficulty expressing themselves in written English don't like the movie, while those without said difficulty do.

Billy Bob Thorton again plays a southern hick (a Corrections Officer), a character he does so well at. His father (Peter Boyle) also plays a great bigot (something he began in 1970's ""Joe""). Billy Bob's son played by Heath Ledger, again plays his typical character role as a hick with a conscience. Now, it is Ms. Halle Berry that breaks rank and shows her best in a shockingly well-acted part as a single mother waitress. I saw ""X-Men"" and didn't expect anything out of Berry, but she went for broke and plays such a convincing character, I was happy she won that Oscar!Again, it's a simple plot, but not one without merit, as it explores some serious issues of racism, bigotry, inter-racial relationships, child abuse, obesity, murder, suicide - and does it with a deft and staight forward tone. Quite a load for a 'small' film. It's not a happy picture and at times can be terribly depressing. But, the script also keeps it afloat with realistic dialogue, taken well advantage of by the cast.One note of dismay: Only in America can two characters make love in a film where the woman is completely naked and the man still has his underwear on!

689814,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00005YU1M,Martin Asiner,"[16, 21]","One of the best pictures of 2001 is MONSTER'S BALL.  It is no surprise that Halle Berry won an Oscar for her role as Leticia, an African-American wife who has to cope with the loss of her son just as she has to learn to cope with the problems involved in having a white lover, played by Billy Bob Thornton.  This film is noteworthy for more than just the extraordinary acting of its cast, but for its subtext that suggests that as society changes, some people manage to change with it and stay afloat, while others cannot or will not, and pay a fearsome price.Director Marc Forster sets the stage in a Southern prison with the upcoming execution of a convict played by Sean Combs, who in his brief role manages to invest his character with a myriad of conflicting emotions, most of which revolve around his wife, an uncaring Leticia, and an overweight son who cares enough for both himself and his mother.  She no longer has any feeling for her husband and blames his long criminal career as the reason.  All she cares about is giving her son the opportunity to say goodbye to his father.  The scenes between the condemned and the prison guards responsible for making sure the execution goes off without a hitch are played with an undercurrent of inevitability.  Each recognizes that they all have a role to play in a script that was written when the governor turned down Combs' last minute stay of execution. Heath Ledger plays Hank's son who dares to alter the script slightly by vomiting in horror at his own role.  It was painful for the audience to see how callously Hank beats his son, thus identifying him as surely the villain.  But in this movie, not all monsters wear horns or are incapable of change.  Heath Ledger cannot change nor can he reconcile his feelings of rage at the system with rage at a father who so clearly supports a life-denying system.  In despondency, he shoots himself.  Hank, who admits that he once hated his son, now begins to change.  At home, his father, well-played by Peter Boyle, represents the dying view of the South as the last bastion of resistance against civil rights and uppity nigras.  His venom, upon seeing that his son is involved with a black woman, is brutally cutting, more so because his remarks do not represent a thoughtful insult but merely the tip of a prejudiced iceberg whose icy base extends all the way to Reconstruction.  He,like his son, cannot change, and his punishment is to be exiled to a nursing home.  Leticia is first seen as a mean woman whose rage at a criminal husband extends to an obese son who eats more the more she hits him for being obese.  When her son is killed in a hit and run, her grief is real, even if she expresses it first by laughing, then crying, then laughing again.  She and Hank connect, with each one suffering greatly, but in Hank's case, his pain is internalized.  It is only by the mildest change of voice tone does he suggest that his calm face hides a heart that is at least as devastated as Leticia's.  They begin an affair that starts out as pure sex.  It is only after several graphic couplings that expose Halle Berry's nude body, does she begin to see that pain comes and goes, but it is trust that must endure.  Leticia must endure the overt racism of Hank's father and the unexpected discovery of Hank's participation in her husband's execution before she realizes that the many monsters that lurk in everyone's soul are put there by that person, and that with love, with courage, and with effort, they can be removed too.",5,Monster's Ball: Some People Change--Some Don't,1026777600,"07 16, 2002",2002,3529,"['One', 'best', 'pictures', '2001', 'MONSTER', 'BALL', 'surprise', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'won', 'Oscar', 'role', 'Leticia', 'African-American', 'wife', 'who', 'cope', 'loss', 'son', 'just', 'learn', 'cope', 'problems', 'involved', 'having', 'white', 'lover', 'played', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'film', 'noteworthy', 'more', 'just', 'extraordinary', 'acting', 'cast', 'subtext', 'society', 'changes', 'people', 'manage', 'change', 'stay', 'afloat', 'others', 'can', 'not', 'will', 'not', 'pay', 'fearsome', 'price.Director', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'stage', 'Southern', 'prison', 'upcoming', 'execution', 'convict', 'played', 'Sean', 'Combs', 'who', 'brief', 'role', 'manages', 'invest', 'character', 'myriad', 'conflicting', 'emotions', 'most', 'revolve', 'wife', 'uncaring', 'Leticia', 'overweight', 'son', 'who', 'enough', 'mother', 'no', 'longer', 'feeling', 'husband', 'blames', 'long', 'criminal', 'career', 'reason', 'about', 'giving', 'son', 'opportunity', 'say', 'goodbye', 'father', 'scenes', 'condemned', 'prison', 'guards', 'responsible', 'making', 'sure', 'execution', 'off', 'hitch', 'are', 'played', 'undercurrent', 'inevitability', 'have', 'role', 'play', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'when', 'governor', 'turned', 'down', 'Combs', 'last', 'minute', 'stay', 'execution', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Hank', 'son', 'who', 'alter', 'script', 'slightly', 'vomiting', 'horror', 'own', 'role', 'was', 'painful', 'audience', 'see', 'how', 'callously', 'Hank', 'son', 'thus', 'identifying', 'surely', 'villain', 'movie', 'not', 'monsters', 'wear', 'horns', 'are', 'incapable', 'change', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'can', 'not', 'change', 'can', 'reconcile', 'feelings', 'rage', 'system', 'rage', 'father', 'who', 'so', 'clearly', 'life-denying', 'system', 'despondency', 'shoots', 'Hank', 'who', 'once', 'hated', 'son', 'now', 'change', 'home', 'father', 'well-played', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'dying', 'view', 'South', 'last', 'bastion', 'resistance', 'civil', 'rights', 'uppity', 'nigras', 'venom', 'seeing', 'son', 'involved', 'black', 'woman', 'brutally', 'cutting', 'more', 'so', 'remarks', 'do', 'not', 'represent', 'thoughtful', 'insult', 'merely', 'tip', 'prejudiced', 'iceberg', 'icy', 'base', 'way', 'Reconstruction', 'son', 'can', 'not', 'change', 'punishment', 'be', 'exiled', 'nursing', 'home', 'Leticia', 'first', 'seen', 'mean', 'woman', 'rage', 'criminal', 'husband', 'obese', 'son', 'who', 'more', 'more', 'being', 'obese', 'When', 'son', 'killed', 'hit', 'run', 'grief', 'real', 'even', 'first', 'laughing', 'then', 'crying', 'then', 'laughing', 'again', 'Hank', 'connect', 'one', 'suffering', 'greatly', 'Hank', 'case', 'pain', 'internalized', 'only', 'mildest', 'change', 'voice', 'tone', 'suggest', 'calm', 'face', 'heart', 'least', 'as', 'devastated', 'Leticia', 'begin', 'affair', 'out', 'pure', 'sex', 'only', 'several', 'graphic', 'couplings', 'expose', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'nude', 'body', 'begin', 'see', 'pain', 'trust', 'must', 'endure', 'Leticia', 'must', 'endure', 'overt', 'racism', 'Hank', 'father', 'unexpected', 'discovery', 'Hank', 'participation', 'husband', 'execution', 'many', 'monsters', 'lurk', 'everyone', 'soul', 'are', 'put', 'there', 'person', 'love', 'courage', 'effort', 'can', 'be', 'removed', 'too']",Monster's Ball

689817,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005YU1M,Matthew Horner,"[3, 4]","""Monster's Ball"" is one of the most searing American melodramas of recent years and is highlighted by dynamite performances by Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry [Best Actress Oscar]. It is not so much a love story as it is the story of two emotionally overwhelmed people clinging to each other out of desperation. As such, it may hit a little too close to home for some people. It's improbable that a man and a woman in real life would experience the absurdly coincidental events these characters do, but the fact remains that many couples form a union from basic needs rather than from true love.Hank [Thornton] is a state prison guard like his father [Peter Boyle] before him. One night he helps prepare a young man convicted of murder for execution. He doesn't think all that much about this. It's an unpleasant part of his job. What he can not know is that he will later become involved with the man's widow, Lucille [Berry]. This occurs soon after Hank's own life is shattered by a devastating tragedy in his own family. Meanwhile, Lucille's problems are about to take another dreadful turn. When the two finally turn to each other, it is out of loss, desperation and the absence of hope. They seek solace in each other's bodies.

It's a love story based on tragedy and rebounding chemistry, but any issues far from relationships are only touched periphally and with shallow direction.  Nevertheless, the connection between Thornton's development into a better human being and Halle Berry's struggle to survive through life is undeniably acute, but it seems that her Oscar award is biased towards her beauty and pornography rather than her acting.  She is indeed a good actress, but her role and performance is at least one notch below Academy Award.  Billy Bob Thornton as always has strength in subtlety, and his emotions are very complimentary when paired with Berry's.  Sean Combs deserves all the praise to come from his part, but all acting aside this movie is weak in final result.  Many people mention the sex scenes as well, and they are well implemented but of no more mention than any other scene.  The cinematography is very good, and the dialogue plays well between the characters which are richly defined, but the inconclusive  and ineffective ending abandons the characters as almost meaningless to any theme the movie may contain.  The ending has potential to be moving, but in contrast to Fallen Angels it falls flat and insipid.

(Here's an idea - stop buying, start watching!) Then of course there was the death of Heath Ledger, and it never seemed like the right time.Two days after coming home from a beach holiday, I decided that now was the right time to watch it. I was in the mood, I had plenty of time, the phone wasn't going to ring and there would be no interruptions.Woah. Straight after watching this movie, I had to stay up and watch something to cheer myself up. Monster's Ball is pretty hard going, particularly the first 30-40 minutes and more after that. But the first part of the movie sucker punches you in the gut and leaves you gasping for air. Oh my god what a movie this was, powerful and disturbing. From Heath Ledger's scenes, to Billy Bob Thornton & Halle Berry doing some terrific acting together, to the diabolical acting from P Diddy/Puff Daddy/Daddy/Diddy/Sean Combs/whatshisface, to the little boy, this film is one of a kind.It has (had?) two great actors in it - Billy Bob and Heath, two particular favourites of mine. I've never been Halle Berry's biggest fan - I thought she was pretty close to awful in Swordfish - but I'll give her something, she did earn the Oscar for this. Everyone says that Heath can only do one facial expression - but whoever told P Diddy he could act should have been shot. This guy actually believes he can act, but I can think of other actors who would have been better in his role. Thankfully, he's not in it much.Since part of it is set on Death Row, it's going to draw comparisons to Green Mile, but it's so much grittier than that, it simply cannot be compared.Heath's short but incredibly intense appearance as the son of Hank (Billy Bob) is full of repressed emotion and built up disappointment, at the same time resenting and seeking his emotionless father's approval. Hank is an almost heartless man, who expects his son to do the same as him and his father before him, but doesn't seem to see that he can't do it. Then he executes a man, and falls for his widow, over chocolate ice cream.Leticia (Halle) sometimes comes across as a not so well thought through character, but you really feel for her, raising a son without a father, who's been on Death Row for 11 years and now out of appeals (was there a reason given as to why he was on Death Row, or did I miss that?), to her alcoholism, to caring for her son. Halle shone in this role, and reminded me a bit of Charlize Theron's portrayal of Aileen Wournos in Monster, she was that good. Her scenes with Billy Bob were electric, and there's an almost too realistic sex scene between them, which afterwards, they almost seem to poke fun at the constant rumours about Billy Bob's size. (Hubba hubba.)This film will come highly recommended, but with a strict warning - you will think about the events of this movie long after the credits have rolled, and you will definitely need to watch something to cheer yourself up after it. Under no circumstances watch it when there is a crisis in the family, or when your boyfriend has split up with you or something equally dramatic.",4,"An utterly depressing, but truly unforgettable movie",1213056000,"06 10, 2008",2008,3210,"['was', 'given', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'absolutely', 'ago', 'usual', 'have', 'build', 'DVDs', 'never', 'seem', 'get', 'watching', 'Here', 'idea', 'stop', 'buying', 'start', 'watching', 'Then', 'course', 'was', 'death', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'never', 'seemed', 'right', 'time.Two', 'days', 'coming', 'home', 'beach', 'holiday', 'decided', 'now', 'was', 'right', 'time', 'watch', 'was', 'mood', 'had', 'plenty', 'time', 'phone', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'ring', 'would', 'be', 'interruptions.Woah', 'Straight', 'watching', 'movie', 'had', 'stay', 'up', 'watch', 'something', 'cheer', 'up', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'pretty', 'hard', 'going', 'particularly', 'first', '30-40', 'minutes', 'more', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'sucker', 'punches', 'gut', 'gasping', 'air', 'Oh', 'god', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'powerful', 'disturbing', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'scenes', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'doing', 'terrific', 'acting', 'together', 'diabolical', 'acting', 'P', 'Diddy/Puff', 'Daddy/Daddy/Diddy/Sean', 'Combs/whatshisface', 'little', 'boy', 'film', 'one', 'kind.It', 'had', 'two', 'great', 'actors', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Heath', 'two', 'particular', 'favourites', 'mine', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'biggest', 'fan', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'close', 'awful', 'Swordfish', ""'ll"", 'give', 'something', 'did', 'earn', 'Oscar', 'Everyone', 'Heath', 'can', 'only', 'do', 'one', 'facial', 'expression', 'whoever', 'told', 'P', 'Diddy', 'could', 'act', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'guy', 'actually', 'can', 'act', 'can', 'think', 'other', 'actors', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'role', 'Thankfully', 'not', 'much.Since', 'part', 'set', 'Death', 'Row', 'going', 'draw', 'comparisons', 'Green', 'Mile', 'so', 'much', 'grittier', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'compared.Heath', 'short', 'incredibly', 'intense', 'appearance', 'son', 'Hank', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'full', 'repressed', 'emotion', 'built', 'up', 'disappointment', 'same', 'time', 'resenting', 'seeking', 'emotionless', 'father', 'approval', 'Hank', 'almost', 'heartless', 'man', 'who', 'son', 'do', 'same', 'father', ""n't"", 'seem', 'see', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'Then', 'man', 'widow', 'chocolate', 'ice', 'cream.Leticia', 'Halle', 'sometimes', 'across', 'not', 'so', 'well', 'thought', 'character', 'really', 'feel', 'raising', 'son', 'father', 'who', 'been', 'Death', 'Row', '11', 'years', 'now', 'appeals', 'was', 'there', 'reason', 'given', 'why', 'was', 'Death', 'Row', 'did', 'miss', 'alcoholism', 'caring', 'son', 'Halle', 'shone', 'role', 'reminded', 'bit', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'portrayal', 'Aileen', 'Wournos', 'Monster', 'was', 'good', 'scenes', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'were', 'electric', 'almost', 'too', 'realistic', 'sex', 'scene', 'afterwards', 'almost', 'seem', 'poke', 'fun', 'constant', 'rumours', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'size', 'Hubba', 'hubba', 'film', 'will', 'come', 'highly', 'recommended', 'strict', 'warning', 'will', 'think', 'events', 'movie', 'long', 'credits', 'have', 'rolled', 'will', 'definitely', 'need', 'watch', 'something', 'cheer', 'up', 'circumstances', 'watch', 'when', 'crisis', 'family', 'when', 'boyfriend', 'split', 'up', 'something', 'equally', 'dramatic']",Monster's Ball

I'll merely tell you what I thought.  There were some powerful emotional moments in this film, namely Sonny's (Heath Ledger) moment of truth and Leticia (Berry) having a breakdown at the hospital. Other than that, I find the resolution of the movie way too easy.  Am I to believe that Frank (Billy Bob Thornton) completely reverses his racist views after meeting one person?  Well, I suppose it could happen, but most changes that dramatic are not overnight I'm afraid to say.  The sex scenes were provocative, but I think that might have been just more capitalization on Halle's body. The gratuitous nudity was unnecessary. I got the point early on.And the ending?  I think there might have been more conflict there, but it's kind of left unexplored.  I thought, ""That's it?""I did think that ""Monster's Ball"" had potential to be a better movie, but the performances were pretty good and the intense scenes made it watchable.Million dollar question: did Halle Berry deserve her Oscar?

I felt like yelling at the screen:  ENOUGH ALREADY!  But a morbid fascination with where this movie was going made me stay in my seat, mouth open...and I can honestly say that ultimately &quot;Monster's Ball&quot; proved to be worth my time and effort.But,the big question here is:  why show so much negativity? Does so much downbeat material make for an uplifting, or more importantly interesting movie experience? Does: &quot;I'm so down...it looks like up to me&quot; apply here? Why have your main character,Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) exhibit such self-loathing and hatred and thereby making him unpalatable as a hero?  And ultimately does Hank's metamorphosis into a loving person make sense?I don't have all the answers but I certainly do have impressions and can attest to the cumulative power of the images presented.  Hanks's conversion from bigot to loving, caring human being and Leticia's (Halle Berry)lover doesn't make logical sense but we are rooting for &quot;them&quot; to work and so when it does we believe it. Hank and Leticia are two lost souls, at the end of their psychic ropes, whose only hope for survival is each other.  And so they cling and they claw and they gravitate towards each other as only the desperate are wont to do.  As Leticia says to Hank in as heartbreaking a way as possible, and after years of being tread upon and beaten down: &quot;I need you to take care of me.&quot;Much has been said of Halle Berry's performance and it is a wonder: frustrated, down-and-out, sexually repressed, needy, tired and worn out but always exhibiting the smallest kernel of hope. Billy Bob Thornton wakes up from his zombie-like performance in &quot;The Man Who Wasn't There&quot; and makes Hank a living breathing character...fantastically flawed yet seemingly capable of turning his life around.&quot;Monster's Ball&quot; will be a hard watch for many people and it's flaws might be enough to turn people off but ultimately it is a profoundly even perversely powerful film...not for everyone but for the few who can appreciate the redemptive power of LOVE.",4,Love Among The Ruins,1009929600,"01 2, 2002",2002,2352,"['Marc', 'Forster', 'quot', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'quot', 'host', 'horrific', 'deeds', 'actions', 'first', '40', 'minutes', 'so', 'many', 'fact', 'almost', 'walked', 'theater', 'child', 'abuse', 'attempted', 'patricide', 'suicide', 'public', 'execution', 'racial', 'hatred', 'name', 'several', 'felt', 'yelling', 'screen', 'ENOUGH', 'ALREADY', 'morbid', 'fascination', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'made', 'stay', 'seat', 'mouth', 'open', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'ultimately', 'quot', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'quot', 'proved', 'be', 'worth', 'time', 'effort.But', 'big', 'question', 'here', 'why', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'negativity', 'so', 'much', 'downbeat', 'material', 'make', 'uplifting', 'more', 'importantly', 'interesting', 'movie', 'experience', 'quot', ""'m"", 'so', 'down', 'quot', 'apply', 'here', 'Why', 'have', 'main', 'character', 'Hank', 'Grotowski', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'exhibit', 'such', 'self-loathing', 'hatred', 'thereby', 'making', 'unpalatable', 'hero', 'ultimately', 'Hank', 'metamorphosis', 'loving', 'person', 'make', 'sense', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'answers', 'certainly', 'do', 'have', 'impressions', 'can', 'attest', 'cumulative', 'power', 'images', 'presented', 'Hanks', 'conversion', 'bigot', 'loving', 'caring', 'human', 'being', 'Leticia', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'lover', ""n't"", 'make', 'logical', 'sense', 'are', 'rooting', 'quot', 'quot', 'work', 'so', 'when', 'believe', 'Hank', 'Leticia', 'are', 'two', 'lost', 'souls', 'end', 'psychic', 'ropes', 'only', 'hope', 'survival', 'other', 'so', 'cling', 'claw', 'gravitate', 'towards', 'other', 'only', 'desperate', 'are', 'wont', 'do', 'Leticia', 'Hank', 'as', 'heartbreaking', 'way', 'possible', 'years', 'being', 'tread', 'upon', 'beaten', 'down', 'quot', 'need', 'take', 'care', 'me.', 'quot', 'Much', 'been', 'said', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'performance', 'wonder', 'frustrated', 'down-and-out', 'sexually', 'repressed', 'needy', 'tired', 'worn', 'out', 'always', 'exhibiting', 'smallest', 'kernel', 'hope', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'up', 'zombie-like', 'performance', 'quot', 'Man', 'Who', 'Was', ""n't"", 'quot', 'Hank', 'living', 'breathing', 'character', 'fantastically', 'flawed', 'yet', 'seemingly', 'capable', 'turning', 'life', 'around.', 'quot', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'quot', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'watch', 'many', 'people', 'flaws', 'might', 'be', 'enough', 'turn', 'people', 'off', 'ultimately', 'profoundly', 'even', 'perversely', 'powerful', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'few', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'redemptive', 'power', 'LOVE']",Monster's Ball

These two very different people are brought together in an intense relationship.This is a raw, gripping film. It's a pretty dark piece at times: its characters are mired in poverty, familial dysfunction, and/or racism, and there are some graphic, heartbreaking scenes of human suffering. There are also some extremely graphic sex scenes, but I feel this extreme material is wholly relevant to the characters and plot.The performances really make this film special. Coronji Calhoun is quite touching as Leticia's son. Heath Ledger and Peter Boyle offer solid support as Hank's son and father. But the film really hinges on the two leads, and they are extraordinary. Thornton brings a depth and complexity to this very difficult character. And Halle Berry! At times explosive, at times quiet and subdued, she creates a rich and full portrait of a woman going through both tragedy and passion.""Monster's Ball"" asks whether, in the midst of suffering and irrational hate, there exists the possibility for redemptive love and personal transformation.

689826,AJK5WHV1GW941,B00005YU1M,Mikeisha Best,"[1, 1]","I saw ""Monster's Ball"" in the movie theatre. I felt then that it was a good movie, but the key reason I even went to see it in theatres is because Halle Berry, one of my all-time favorite actresses, was starring in it.  I have seen most of Halle's movies, and I can attest to the fact that this is, acting-wise, her best film. Halle is an outstanding actress, but I have never really seen her give her all, until now.  Halle really went all out for this movie, and she deserved the Oscar.  Although I don't think it's fair that so many African-American actresses before Halle have done phenomenal jobs in movies and never received an Oscar, but Halle shined in this film and that Oscar had her name on it as far as I'm concerned.  The ranting and raving about Halle had to be foremost, however, the entire cast did a great job.  Billy Bob Thornton, Heath Ledger, Mos Def, and Diddy all showed their acting abilities, and I was impressed.This was not an easy film to watch.  It didn't have a Hollywood ending or cheesy subject matter.  The film shows us three generations of corrections officers, a grandfather, a father, and a son.  The father and grandfather both have prejudiced mindsets, however the son doesn't.  We learn that the father  (Hank) doesn't love his son, and his son does an unlikely thing to show how upset he is about that, commits suicide in front of his father.We meet Leticia and her son Tyrell.  Leticia's husband is given the death penalty, and she's naturally on-edge.  She attempts to relax her nerves by smoking, drinking and lashing out at her obese progeny.  As the movie progresses, Tyrell is tragically killed in a hit and run.  From what the movie implies, all Leticia had was her son.  She was never seen with parents or friends.  After her husband and son die, she's all alone in life, until she meets Hank.  Hank sees Leticia and her dying son on the side of the road and decide to stop and offer aid to them.  He rushes them to the hospital, and from there, the two of them build a friendship, and then a relationship.Hank and Leticia both feel vulnerable because of the unfortunate occurrences they both lived.  Their relationship, from the outside looking in, resembles two people who are yearning for a happiness they'd seemingly never come across and hoped to find in one another.The irony of Hank and Leticia's relationship is that Hank was one of the correction's officers who helped kill Leticia's husband, but she is oblivious to this.This motion picture will totally lure you into it's painful plot.  Other reviews that I've read on this movie said that it was boring, and perhaps to some, it is; but if you give this movie your undivided attention from start to finish, there is hardly a boring moment in my opinion.I DO NOT recommend this picture for the faint of heart.  It includes some of the most graphic scenes cinema has ever seen, and some of them are not easy to stomach.  Also, that oh so popular sex scene...very candid and graphic. However, if you can handle it, by all means take a look at this heart-wrenching film.",4,Halle Berry at her best!,1182816000,"06 26, 2007",2007,3075,"['saw', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'movie', 'theatre', 'felt', 'then', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'key', 'reason', 'even', 'went', 'see', 'theatres', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'was', 'starring', 'have', 'seen', 'most', 'Halle', 'movies', 'can', 'attest', 'fact', 'acting-wise', 'best', 'film', 'Halle', 'outstanding', 'actress', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'seen', 'give', 'now', 'Halle', 'really', 'went', 'out', 'movie', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'fair', 'so', 'many', 'African-American', 'actresses', 'Halle', 'have', 'done', 'phenomenal', 'jobs', 'movies', 'never', 'received', 'Oscar', 'Halle', 'shined', 'film', 'Oscar', 'had', 'name', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'ranting', 'raving', 'Halle', 'had', 'be', 'foremost', 'however', 'entire', 'cast', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Diddy', 'showed', 'acting', 'abilities', 'was', 'impressed.This', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'cheesy', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'three', 'generations', 'corrections', 'officers', 'grandfather', 'father', 'son', 'father', 'grandfather', 'have', 'prejudiced', 'mindsets', 'however', 'son', ""n't"", 'learn', 'father', 'Hank', ""n't"", 'love', 'son', 'son', 'unlikely', 'thing', 'show', 'how', 'upset', 'commits', 'suicide', 'front', 'father.We', 'meet', 'Leticia', 'son', 'Tyrell', 'Leticia', 'husband', 'given', 'death', 'penalty', 'naturally', 'on-edge', 'relax', 'nerves', 'smoking', 'drinking', 'lashing', 'out', 'obese', 'progeny', 'movie', 'Tyrell', 'tragically', 'killed', 'hit', 'run', 'what', 'movie', 'implies', 'Leticia', 'had', 'was', 'son', 'was', 'never', 'seen', 'parents', 'friends', 'husband', 'son', 'die', 'alone', 'life', 'Hank', 'Hank', 'Leticia', 'dying', 'son', 'side', 'road', 'decide', 'stop', 'offer', 'aid', 'hospital', 'there', 'two', 'build', 'friendship', 'then', 'relationship.Hank', 'Leticia', 'feel', 'vulnerable', 'unfortunate', 'occurrences', 'lived', 'relationship', 'outside', 'looking', 'resembles', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'yearning', 'happiness', ""'d"", 'seemingly', 'never', 'come', 'hoped', 'find', 'one', 'another.The', 'irony', 'Hank', 'Leticia', 'relationship', 'Hank', 'was', 'one', 'correction', 'officers', 'who', 'helped', 'kill', 'Leticia', 'husband', 'oblivious', 'this.This', 'motion', 'picture', 'will', 'totally', 'lure', 'painful', 'plot', 'Other', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'movie', 'said', 'was', 'boring', 'perhaps', 'give', 'movie', 'undivided', 'attention', 'start', 'finish', 'hardly', 'boring', 'moment', 'opinion.I', 'DO', 'NOT', 'recommend', 'picture', 'faint', 'heart', 'most', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'cinema', 'ever', 'seen', 'are', 'not', 'easy', 'stomach', 'Also', 'oh', 'so', 'popular', 'sex', 'scene', 'very', 'candid', 'graphic', 'However', 'can', 'handle', 'means', 'take', 'look', 'heart-wrenching', 'film']",Monster's Ball

This is an Indy film, thoughtful with symbolism and a profound message. This movie caused a knee jerk reaction in parts of the black community, causing calls for boycotting and some racial tension.Simply put, a white racist death row prison guard, through a set of tragic and complex circumstances, begins to fall in love with the black wife of an inmate that he recently executed, of which she is totally unaware. Their anguished bond is the fact that they both have lost young sons.There is some blunt sexual content, however it's mainly queasy and uncomfortably painful rather than erotic. Still, this motion picture is not intended for children.This movie somehow captures the mood of yearning reconcillation between two devastated soulswho discover they have absolutely nowhere else left to turn, except to each other.This is a startling ""feel bad"" movie that is able to say: tragedy will not be permitted to become the end of all hope. Rather it states: When you're at the end of your rope, letting go can be the best thing you can do.Ultimately consoling in a way that seeks to unlock a warm, rainy night in your heart where abandoned innocence is finally given a chance to be regained.Atmospheric and  moody with a poetic and mystical resolution that leaves you with a mesmerizing shimmer of hope.""The title comes from a custom in medieval England where prisoners awaiting execution were called monsters.

689828,A1XH3UYZC8DEY5,B00005YU1M,Milkman,"[6, 7]","Monster's Ball gives us an Anti-Hollywood movie, a movie that excels not with eye candy and fads but with brutal realism set in a starkly portrayed southern USA.I watched Monster's Ball with my wife, who constantly tried to guess out loud what would happen next.  She was wrong every time.  It's that kind of movie.  It's not trying to twist and turn the plot, but it is unexpected because it's not clich&eacute;d.  Also see: Anti-Hollywood movie.In the wrong hands, this film could have done the usual Hollywood thing: start preaching about the death penalty or racism.  It didn't do that.  It told a story about two people who are escaping their painful lives by joining together.  The movie has a very explicit sex scene.  It is shown so raw and real because the director needed to prove that Hank was not taking advantage of Leticia or raping her.  The scene showed us that Hank and Leticia's only refuge from the pain in their lives was when they bonded sexually.  If we hadn't seen the actualization of the two characters in the throes of their passion we would have questioned the relationship as it warded off threats the rest of the movie.It was obvious that many pitfalls lurked in their paths.  The film navigated these in a way that intrigues the viewer.  Again, it is unpredictable.This is not a feel good movie.  The execution, explicit sex scene, and heaviness were too much for my wife to enjoy the film.  I, on the other hand, appreciated what this film did with the story.  I really enjoyed the minimalist dialogue.  When I look to sum up this film in my mind, I say: here we have a very earthy story that gripped me for the entirety, had no discernable flaws, and was very well performed.And ironically, the outstanding performance by Halle Berry in a very Anti-Hollywood movie earned her Hollywood accolades in the form of the Oscar.",5,"Gripping, Authentic, Anti-Hollywood Movie",1069286400,"11 20, 2003",2003,1853,"['Monster', 'Ball', 'Anti-Hollywood', 'movie', 'movie', 'not', 'eye', 'candy', 'fads', 'brutal', 'realism', 'set', 'starkly', 'portrayed', 'southern', 'USA.I', 'watched', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'wife', 'who', 'constantly', 'tried', 'guess', 'out', 'loud', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'was', 'wrong', 'time', 'kind', 'movie', 'not', 'trying', 'twist', 'turn', 'plot', 'unexpected', 'not', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd.', 'Also', 'see', 'Anti-Hollywood', 'movie.In', 'wrong', 'hands', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'thing', 'start', 'preaching', 'death', 'penalty', 'racism', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'told', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'escaping', 'painful', 'lives', 'joining', 'together', 'movie', 'very', 'explicit', 'sex', 'scene', 'shown', 'so', 'raw', 'real', 'director', 'needed', 'prove', 'Hank', 'was', 'not', 'taking', 'advantage', 'Leticia', 'raping', 'scene', 'showed', 'Hank', 'Leticia', 'only', 'refuge', 'pain', 'lives', 'was', 'when', 'bonded', 'sexually', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'actualization', 'two', 'characters', 'throes', 'passion', 'would', 'have', 'questioned', 'relationship', 'warded', 'off', 'threats', 'rest', 'movie.It', 'was', 'obvious', 'many', 'pitfalls', 'lurked', 'paths', 'film', 'navigated', 'way', 'viewer', 'Again', 'unpredictable.This', 'not', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'execution', 'explicit', 'sex', 'scene', 'heaviness', 'were', 'too', 'much', 'wife', 'enjoy', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'appreciated', 'what', 'film', 'did', 'story', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'minimalist', 'dialogue', 'When', 'look', 'sum', 'up', 'film', 'mind', 'say', 'here', 'have', 'very', 'earthy', 'story', 'gripped', 'entirety', 'had', 'discernable', 'flaws', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'performed.And', 'ironically', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'very', 'Anti-Hollywood', 'movie', 'earned', 'Hollywood', 'accolades', 'form', 'Oscar']",Monster's Ball

Just a little more edgy but still the same cotton candy 'rascism is bad' message done up all super sugary for your consumption.First things first, Halle Berry really reveals the blatant charade she was playing about not wanting to do nudity when negotiating 2 million dollars to briefly flash her breasts in Swordfish.  She shows as much as she can without it becoming a porn film in Monster's ball in a very explicit sex scene with Billy Bob Thorton and all with no reservations or shyness whatsoever.Great suspension of belief is required as Leticia unknowingly falls in love to the man who executed her husband for whatever crime he was convicted of.Of course, Billy Bob comes with the baggage of racial prejudiced culture and family.  And typical fashion for these types of movies, they are brought together by circumstances and learn not only to tolerate but to truly care for each other.It all comes so easy for the gorgeous Halle Berry and the hideous Billy Bob.  One minute Billy Bob is harassing black neighbor kids because they are black.  The next he is in love with a black woman.And as easy as the prejudices disintegrate, the prejudices reimerge and cause problems.  This is the most insulting aspect of this movie.Leticia and BBT (whatever his character name was) are now in love and Leticia comes to visit ole BBT.  There she comes across his father played by Peter Boyle who says some rascist things.  Well, the character of Leticia is presented as a truely shallow person and simpleton.  She runs off hating the BBT character and this is a HUGE obstacle in their relationship being unable to trust BBT as not being a rascist as well.Apparently, the writers see fit to have the Leticia character be such an unreasonable dullard that she transfers any rascist sentiments by anyone to apply also to how BBT feels about her.Just as if a butterfly has rascist thoughts in a corn field in Illinois, it can cause a chain reaction and become genocide in Indonesia.  So it is that Leticia and BBT break up due to the rascist perspective of BBT's father.  It's all so hard to overcome because Leticia won't talk to BBT anymore to know he isn't a rascist also.The movie is another simplistic feel good story designed for extra-segregated types who like to proclaim ""I have (Black/White) friends and I consider them my equals.""Despite being complete garbage otherwise, I did have a fondness for a certain scene.  BBT brings his rascist dad Peter Boyle to the old people's home.  During the interview, the representative states ""You must really love your father"".

A woman becomes involved with a guard who was at her husband's execution.  But the reason behind the realtionship is one of desparation.For this to work, you need to have actors that this is reasonable.  But Hallie Berry is just too beautiful and they have done nothing to make her look any less beautiful.  As presented, she would have no problem attracting a variety of desirable men.  There are a number of actress who would be physically better suited or they could have just made Hallie look plain but no, they had to not only go with the flavour of the year and make her look glamourous too boot.Additionally, they give her a child that would never be hers and her husbands.  But was choosen again to further the storyline.This is an interesting story that was ruined by casting for dollars.

The storyline is soooooooooooooooo thin that it's a wonder I can even name two or three things about these people. Halle's character? Hits her kid because he's fat and sneaks food, has sex with a stranger the night her kid dies, then is supposed to live &quot;happily ever after&quot; with Thornton's character, eating icecream next to the family cemetery? He's a &quot;reformed&quot; racist, I guess, and has sex with hookers that his son has sex with. Yeah, I'm sure a stunningly beautiful woman like Halle Berry (even with the stereotypical name Leticia) would fall for this older, white racist redneck. Please! This was her best performance? Why? Because she had sex in different positions? Wow, I'm blown away. She has even proven herself to be Oscar material with stunning performances in James Bond and Gothika. Wow. Halle has come so far.

689836,A2ZA3LSJZD9UO0,B00005YU1M,Mr G Bowden,"[5, 8]","It goes to show how blind some moviegoers are in their lament that last year was an awful year for movies. In my humble opinion, last year was one of the best for movies, seeing as it was one where traditional blockbusters failed to deliver and audiences were called upon to find a bit more originality and ingenuity in their visits to the multiplex. The indie circuit produced a fine line of great cult classics including, to name a few, ""Memento"", ""Donnie Darko"", ""L.I.E."", ""Hedwig & The Angry Inch"", ""In The Bedroom""; but stealing their thunder is this beautiful, powerfully performed film, that really undeservedly missed out on the Oscar race last year.The one film I can remember feeling like as I was watching Marc Forster's sophomore effort was Tom Tykwer's third film, ""The Princess & The Warrior"", another of 2001's criminally ignored gems. Milo Addica and Will Rokos' Oscar nominated script (which, to their credit, weaved its way through Hollywood for years and never succumbed to that old debacle, 'script doctoring') works with characters as opposed to an iron-clad plotline, and, along with Forster's deft direction, makes the film feel like a giant wave as one event follows another in an amazing emotional rollercoaster. This is a film that commands the audience's attention and calls for them to soak in every detail emblazoned on the screen, all at a leisurely pace which some will find irritating and others intoxicating ... Forster, a Swedish-born filmmaker who studied in New York, is more than ably assisted by his cast and crew, from Roberto Schaefer's gorgeously bleached photography to the ethereal score, both of which complement the heavy, Deep Southern atmosphere.And the cast duly deliver the kind of performances that are all too rare in many movies. 2001 will be remembered as Billy Bob Thornton's year in how he flitted from mild-mannered barber in the Coens' ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" to a phobia-ridden bankrobber in Barry Levinson's ""Bandits"" to this acutely subtle portrayal of a man searching for an emotional connection and break away from his suffocating family. And Halle Berry is his perfect match, leaving her inhibitions and her diva-style aloofness (as displayed in blockbusters ""X-Men"" and ""Swordfish"") at the door for an animalistic manifestation of a woman at the end of her emotional tether (I bought this DVD based solely on her Oscar clip). Of the supporting players, Heath Ledger, in a surprisingly short role, gives the audience something a lot more substantial and interesting than his ""10 Things I Hate About You"" performance gave cause for us to suspect, and Mos Def is equally good as the only genuinely fatherly father in the entire film. And Peter Boyle ... the fact that he didn't win the Oscar is heartbreaking enough for how concentratedly vile, creepy and good his performance is. Fans of his ""X-Files"" episode, where he played a superbly affable medium, will be shaken to the core.Addica and Rokos' screenplay also, after hitting its characters and the audience with an enormous mounting of tension, has the audacity to end on an ambiguous, almost spiritual high that many have argued as lacking and infuriating. To be honest, the resolution in the characters' faces spoke volumes for me and, whatever happened afterwards, the newfound inner peace and the casting out of the past is what the film is celebrating. For me, ""Monster's Ball"" could have gained a few more nominations come Oscar time (film, director, actor, supporting actor, photography, score), but what remains is a rugged Southern diamond that will stand the test of time and prevail as a modern classic. The DVD, meanwhile, includes two witty and insightful audio commentaries by Forster (one with Shaefer and the other with Berry and Thornton), but the best feature is the outtake where Berry and Thornton, amid joking and giggling, seamlessly become Leticia and Hank infront of our eyes ... spellbinding.",5,Movingly Raw and Beautiful,1023321600,"06 6, 2002",2002,3937,"['show', 'how', 'blind', 'moviegoers', 'are', 'lament', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'awful', 'year', 'movies', 'humble', 'opinion', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'seeing', 'was', 'one', 'where', 'traditional', 'blockbusters', 'failed', 'deliver', 'audiences', 'were', 'called', 'upon', 'find', 'bit', 'more', 'originality', 'ingenuity', 'visits', 'multiplex', 'indie', 'circuit', 'produced', 'fine', 'line', 'great', 'cult', 'classics', 'including', 'name', 'few', 'Memento', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'L.I.E', 'Hedwig', 'Angry', 'Inch', 'Bedroom', 'stealing', 'thunder', 'beautiful', 'powerfully', 'performed', 'film', 'really', 'undeservedly', 'missed', 'out', 'Oscar', 'race', 'last', 'year.The', 'one', 'film', 'can', 'remember', 'feeling', 'was', 'watching', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'sophomore', 'effort', 'was', 'Tom', 'Tykwer', 'third', 'film', 'Princess', 'Warrior', '2001', 'criminally', 'ignored', 'gems', 'Milo', 'Addica', 'Will', 'Rokos', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'script', 'credit', 'weaved', 'way', 'Hollywood', 'years', 'never', 'succumbed', 'old', 'debacle', 'doctoring', 'characters', 'opposed', 'iron-clad', 'plotline', 'Forster', 'deft', 'direction', 'film', 'feel', 'giant', 'wave', 'one', 'event', 'amazing', 'emotional', 'rollercoaster', 'film', 'audience', 'attention', 'calls', 'soak', 'detail', 'emblazoned', 'screen', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'will', 'find', 'irritating', 'others', 'intoxicating', 'Forster', 'Swedish-born', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'studied', 'New', 'York', 'more', 'ably', 'assisted', 'cast', 'crew', 'Roberto', 'Schaefer', 'gorgeously', 'bleached', 'photography', 'ethereal', 'score', 'complement', 'heavy', 'Deep', 'Southern', 'cast', 'duly', 'deliver', 'kind', 'performances', 'are', 'too', 'rare', 'many', 'movies', '2001', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'year', 'how', 'flitted', 'mild-mannered', 'barber', 'Coens', 'Man', 'Who', 'Was', ""n't"", 'phobia-ridden', 'bankrobber', 'Barry', 'Levinson', 'Bandits', 'acutely', 'subtle', 'portrayal', 'man', 'searching', 'emotional', 'connection', 'break', 'away', 'suffocating', 'family', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'perfect', 'match', 'leaving', 'inhibitions', 'diva-style', 'aloofness', 'displayed', 'blockbusters', 'X-Men', 'Swordfish', 'door', 'animalistic', 'manifestation', 'woman', 'end', 'emotional', 'tether', 'bought', 'DVD', 'based', 'solely', 'Oscar', 'clip', 'supporting', 'players', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'surprisingly', 'short', 'role', 'audience', 'something', 'lot', 'more', 'substantial', 'interesting', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'performance', 'gave', 'cause', 'suspect', 'Mos', 'Def', 'equally', 'good', 'only', 'genuinely', 'fatherly', 'father', 'entire', 'film', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'Oscar', 'heartbreaking', 'enough', 'how', 'concentratedly', 'vile', 'creepy', 'good', 'performance', 'Fans', 'X-Files', 'episode', 'where', 'played', 'superbly', 'affable', 'medium', 'will', 'be', 'shaken', 'core.Addica', 'Rokos', 'screenplay', 'also', 'hitting', 'characters', 'audience', 'enormous', 'mounting', 'tension', 'audacity', 'end', 'ambiguous', 'almost', 'spiritual', 'high', 'many', 'have', 'argued', 'lacking', 'infuriating', 'be', 'honest', 'resolution', 'characters', 'spoke', 'volumes', 'happened', 'afterwards', 'newfound', 'inner', 'peace', 'casting', 'past', 'what', 'film', 'celebrating', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'could', 'have', 'gained', 'few', 'more', 'nominations', 'come', 'Oscar', 'time', 'film', 'director', 'actor', 'supporting', 'actor', 'photography', 'score', 'what', 'rugged', 'Southern', 'diamond', 'will', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'prevail', 'modern', 'classic', 'DVD', 'meanwhile', 'two', 'witty', 'insightful', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'Forster', 'one', 'Shaefer', 'other', 'Berry', 'Thornton', 'best', 'feature', 'outtake', 'where', 'Berry', 'Thornton', 'joking', 'giggling', 'seamlessly', 'become', 'Leticia', 'Hank', 'infront', 'eyes', 'spellbinding']",Monster's Ball
689837,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B00005YU1M,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[6, 7]","Monster's Ball is a prison drama/romance with a difference. It's about tragedy, compassion, forgiveness, humanity and the need for love but this is no traditional Sunday afternoon made for television weepie. Brilliantly acted by Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry, Monster's Ball is an intelligent but often bleak drama, subtly directed and utterly compelling.The title, Monster's Ball is explained as being a condemned man's last supper before being executed. The condemned man in this case being Lawrence Musgrove (Sean 'Puff Daddy'/'P Diddy' Combs) an African-American who has been awaiting execution in a Georgia penitentiary for 11 years. Musgrove is married to a long suffering emotionally crushed waittress named Leticia (Halle Berry). Together they share an obese 13 year old son Tyrell who barely knows his father and seeks solace in junk food and candy bars.Supervising officer on Musgrove's execution squad is one Hank Grotowski (Thornton), a widower and one of three generations of career prison officers. Hank's only child Sonny (Heath Ledger), a sensitive but unloved young man, is also reluctantly on the execution squad. Together they both live with Hank's retired father Buck, a bitter, nasty and brutal rascist physically disabled by the combination of chronic arthritis and emphysema. The wives of both Buck and Hank have committed suicide and all 3 generations of the Grotowski family are trapped in unhappy lives devoid of feeling, emotionally numbed and it is against this backdrop that enormously tragic circumstances conspire to bring Hank and Leticia together in this fragile love story.As previously mentioned both Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry give stunning performances and contrary to popular opinion Berry's Academy Award was more than justified. Rather than being an act of political correctness it is actually one of the very few occasions where the Academy have actually got things right. Demonstrating a superb range of acting and range of emotions beyond most mere mortals Berry gives a touching and memorable performance as a woman crushed by an unfortunate catalogue of misfortune. Likewise, Thornton (one of American cinemas greatest talents) is captivating as an unloving bigot, bullied by his father and bully to his son, who begins a journey to back to life and emotional and spiritual salvation.This is a very adult, unsentimental and intelligent drama that doesn't pull its punches. It's not what could be described as entertainment as the first hour of the movie particularly presents an increasingly bleak story of grief, loss and tragedy. However, as an examination of the human condition and our intrinsic need for love this is very powerful and thought provoking stuff, which against all odds ends on a positive note of hope. Uncompromisingly well written and directed, Monster's Ball also features great supporting performances (against type) by the likes of Heath Ledger and a surprisingly sombre Sean Combs.

The prison, the dusty roads, the stuffy old house that Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) and his family live in are all beautiful, as seen through the eye of the cinematographer. I think the visual impact and symbolism that director Marc Forster was attempting in his earlier film EVERYTHING PUT TOGETHER fell flat and at times became heavy-handed and downright corny, but were strikingly present in MONSTER'S BALL.Thornton follows up his excellent performance in THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE with another role that appears written for him. (From what I know of Thornton, much of Hank's characteristics and background aren't too far from his own. For instance, I couldn't help laughing over his standing order of chocolate ice cream with a PLASTIC spoon, as I know he has many food phobias, among many others.) I was also thoroughly impressed by Halle Berry (as the Academy and so many others proved to be). This was the first time I'd seen her offer a full range of emotions, and she certainly wasn't afraid to delve into raw and ugly realities of life contained within the story.

Billy Bob Thornton stars as Hank Grotowski, a deputy warden in a Georgia state prison (I think, the film jumps around a bit in regards to that fact.)  Grotowski lives with his son, played by Heath Ledger, also a prison guard, and his ailing father, played by Peter Boyle, a hardened racist whose son and grandson are steadily taking after him.  Their seemingly fine life gets turned on its side in the wake of the execution of a convicted murderer in which the two younger Grotowskis participate.  As the lives of the Grotowskis and the Musgroves, the family of the condemned black man, continue to spiral, unusual connections are made and people's thoughts on life are considered on both sides as they all struggle to cope with new emerging difficulties.  This film was startling in the issue it tackled and in the manner in which the actors behaved on screen.  I think everyone gave their best and more to make themselves come alive for their audience.  For once, I could not see Frank Barone when Peter Boyle spoke and, despite their sometimes extensive resumes, everyone else was also a fresh face for the duration of the film.

689852,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B00005YU1M,"Promise ""promise""","[3, 4]","I didn't see this film when it came out in the theaters because it seemed, well, too monstrous.  Finally, this year, I picked it out of the bin at the local community college library, not knowing what to expect.The first chunk of the film---maybe 40 minutes--was indeed monstrous!  I put my hands over my eyes during the execution scene.  I wonder why I even continued to watch it; apparently the performances of the principles had grabbed me enough to keep my attention.It did get better, although not immediately.  The fact is that both of the main characters, played powerfully by Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton, are not very sympathetic.  In fact you could call them both child abusers.Tragedies in both families soon bring both people to new depths and, in their pain, they manage to reach out to each other and find something like genuine love.  At least we hope that's what it is because  eventually we find ourselves rooting for them.Thornton is wonderful as the brutal racist who finds that he can no longer make a living by watching executions and carrying on his family tradition of hatred.  A lesser actor might not make the transition believable but Thornton, apparently understating it at times, leads us along in his journey.  It's a performance that was as Oscar worthy as Berry's in my opinion; perhaps even more.Berry is physically very beautiful which helps to relieve the bleakness of the story.  She was a smart choice for the role, although, as another reviewer noted, the fact that she is half-white may detract from her credibility here.  She is very good in the hysterical scenes; she lets out all stops.  I found her performance uneven though, particularly in the drunken scene when she flails her arms around aimlessly and in the final scene when one doesn't know if she's agreeing with Thornton that ""everything will be all right"" or if she's just lost her mind and can't do anything but eat that ice cream.Heath Ledger is his usual amazing self.  He projects unimaginable pain in his brief appearance and it's almost a relief to see that his character won't have to suffer any longer.  The child who played Berry's son is also heart wrenching!I would have given the film five stars except for two things.  The first is the excessively creepy way the execution scene was handled.  If the director was trying to make a statement, it was much better done in ""Dead Man Walking,"" in which the execution was wrenching beyond belief but also mitigated by the love of the nun who attended it.The other is the way he handled the sex scenes.  The pathetic encounters with the town hooker were meant to show the lack of warmth in these men's lives, but again it didn't seem very believable.  The actress who played the part was far too beautiful to be the local whore in this run down town; gorgeous blond women who looked like that would have had much better options in life. It seemed exploitative on the part of the director.As others have mentioned, the sex scenes between the two stars were controversial.  I found them curiously unmoving, certainly not loving or even erotic.  Then I realized that it was desperation that was being acted out and that seemed right.  Both characters, especially the woman, were coming from intense neediness, which justified her actions.  Still I wonder if that's how it would have played out in real life.  On a cynical note, I kept thinking that I hoped Berry was being paid well for her work.  I guess winning the Oscar made it worth it.This isn't a film for everyone, as you can tell by the reviews.  I give it a high grade for its story and performances.",4,Strong script; Excellent cast,1273190400,"05 7, 2010",2010,3619,"['did', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'seemed', 'well', 'too', 'monstrous', 'Finally', 'year', 'picked', 'bin', 'local', 'community', 'college', 'library', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'expect.The', 'first', 'chunk', 'film', '-maybe', '40', 'minutes', 'was', 'indeed', 'monstrous', 'put', 'hands', 'eyes', 'execution', 'scene', 'wonder', 'why', 'even', 'continued', 'watch', 'apparently', 'performances', 'principles', 'had', 'grabbed', 'enough', 'keep', 'attention.It', 'did', 'get', 'better', 'not', 'immediately', 'fact', 'main', 'characters', 'played', 'powerfully', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'fact', 'could', 'call', 'child', 'abusers.Tragedies', 'families', 'soon', 'bring', 'people', 'new', 'depths', 'pain', 'manage', 'reach', 'out', 'other', 'find', 'something', 'genuine', 'love', 'least', 'hope', 'what', 'eventually', 'find', 'rooting', 'them.Thornton', 'wonderful', 'brutal', 'racist', 'who', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'make', 'living', 'watching', 'executions', 'carrying', 'family', 'tradition', 'hatred', 'lesser', 'actor', 'might', 'not', 'make', 'transition', 'believable', 'Thornton', 'apparently', 'understating', 'times', 'along', 'journey', 'performance', 'was', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'Berry', 'opinion', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more.Berry', 'physically', 'very', 'beautiful', 'relieve', 'bleakness', 'story', 'was', 'smart', 'choice', 'role', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'fact', 'half-white', 'may', 'detract', 'credibility', 'here', 'very', 'good', 'hysterical', 'scenes', 'out', 'stops', 'found', 'performance', 'uneven', 'particularly', 'drunken', 'scene', 'when', 'arms', 'aimlessly', 'final', 'scene', 'when', 'one', ""n't"", 'know', 'agreeing', 'Thornton', 'everything', 'will', 'be', 'right', 'just', 'lost', 'mind', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'eat', 'ice', 'cream.Heath', 'Ledger', 'usual', 'amazing', 'self', 'projects', 'unimaginable', 'pain', 'brief', 'appearance', 'almost', 'relief', 'see', 'character', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'suffer', 'longer', 'child', 'who', 'played', 'Berry', 'son', 'also', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'two', 'things', 'first', 'excessively', 'creepy', 'way', 'execution', 'scene', 'was', 'handled', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'statement', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'done', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', 'execution', 'was', 'wrenching', 'belief', 'also', 'mitigated', 'love', 'nun', 'who', 'attended', 'it.The', 'other', 'way', 'handled', 'sex', 'scenes', 'pathetic', 'encounters', 'town', 'hooker', 'were', 'meant', 'show', 'lack', 'warmth', 'men', 'lives', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'believable', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'part', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'beautiful', 'be', 'local', 'whore', 'run', 'down', 'town', 'gorgeous', 'blond', 'women', 'who', 'looked', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'much', 'better', 'options', 'life', 'seemed', 'exploitative', 'part', 'director.As', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'sex', 'scenes', 'two', 'stars', 'were', 'controversial', 'found', 'curiously', 'unmoving', 'certainly', 'not', 'loving', 'even', 'erotic', 'Then', 'realized', 'was', 'desperation', 'was', 'being', 'acted', 'out', 'seemed', 'right', 'characters', 'especially', 'woman', 'were', 'coming', 'intense', 'neediness', 'justified', 'actions', 'Still', 'wonder', 'how', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'out', 'real', 'life', 'cynical', 'note', 'kept', 'thinking', 'hoped', 'Berry', 'was', 'being', 'paid', 'well', 'work', 'guess', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'made', 'it.This', ""n't"", 'film', 'everyone', 'can', 'tell', 'reviews', 'give', 'high', 'grade', 'story', 'performances']",Monster's Ball

689854,A3VHUQ85RH0BC3,B00005YU1M,"Raj ""rajivsreviews""","[9, 10]","Since Halle Berry was awarded numerous awards for this movie, and given so much praise, I decided to rent ""Monster's Ball"" just to see what the fuss was all about. After watching it, I was in awe, and feel that this movie should have been commended more than it was.The story starts off with Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton), a corrections officer who lives with his father, a retired officer (who is also a racist) and his son, Sonny (who is an officer only to make his father proud of him). Hank is also a racist because he follows in his father's footsteps. Hank hates his son because he feels like Sonny is too weak like his mother. However, tragedy strikes which make Hank think about his values in life, and what is really important. One day he meets Leticia Musgrove (Halle Berry), an African-American woman who is lying on the road with her unconscious son, screaming for help. He takes them to the hospital, and forms a connection with her. The story continues with Leticia and Hank's relationship.Marc Forster (who also directed Finding Neverland) did flawless job in directing this movie. Billy Bob Thornton, Heath Ledger and Peter Boyle acted well for their roles. But I feel the main credit goes to Halle Berry. I think she did incredibly well for her role as Leticia. Although there is a lot of debate as to whether she should have won the Academy Award or not, I personally feel that she deserved the award for her role in this film. To boldly play a role on a controversial story in one thing, but to act it well is another thing, and I think Halle Berry did very well in that aspect.Furthermore, the chemistry between Hank and Leticia is portrayed nicely in the movie, where we get to see two people, who are suffering emotionally for all the mistakes that they made, and find some kind of solace when they meet one another, which eventually turns into love. Another aspect of the movie that impressed me was the background score. The dark, haunting music really went well with the scenes, and I applaud Asche and Spencer for their work.All in all, I would definitely watch ""Monster's Ball"" again because it is one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time.",5,From Loneliness to Love,1134172800,"12 10, 2005",2005,2186,"['Halle', 'Berry', 'was', 'awarded', 'numerous', 'awards', 'movie', 'given', 'so', 'much', 'praise', 'decided', 'rent', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'watching', 'was', 'awe', 'feel', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'commended', 'more', 'story', 'Hank', 'Grotowski', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'corrections', 'officer', 'who', 'father', 'retired', 'officer', 'who', 'also', 'racist', 'son', 'Sonny', 'who', 'officer', 'only', 'make', 'father', 'proud', 'Hank', 'also', 'racist', 'father', 'footsteps', 'Hank', 'son', 'Sonny', 'too', 'weak', 'mother', 'However', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'make', 'Hank', 'think', 'values', 'life', 'what', 'really', 'important', 'One', 'day', 'Leticia', 'Musgrove', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'African-American', 'woman', 'who', 'lying', 'road', 'unconscious', 'son', 'screaming', 'help', 'hospital', 'connection', 'story', 'Leticia', 'Hank', 'relationship.Marc', 'Forster', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'did', 'flawless', 'job', 'directing', 'movie', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'acted', 'well', 'roles', 'feel', 'main', 'credit', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'think', 'did', 'incredibly', 'well', 'role', 'Leticia', 'lot', 'debate', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'not', 'personally', 'feel', 'deserved', 'award', 'role', 'film', 'boldly', 'play', 'role', 'controversial', 'story', 'one', 'thing', 'act', 'well', 'thing', 'think', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'aspect.Furthermore', 'chemistry', 'Hank', 'Leticia', 'portrayed', 'nicely', 'movie', 'where', 'get', 'see', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'suffering', 'emotionally', 'mistakes', 'made', 'find', 'kind', 'solace', 'when', 'meet', 'one', 'eventually', 'love', 'aspect', 'movie', 'impressed', 'was', 'background', 'score', 'dark', 'haunting', 'music', 'really', 'went', 'well', 'scenes', 'applaud', 'Asche', 'Spencer', 'work.All', 'would', 'definitely', 'watch', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'again', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time']",Monster's Ball
689855,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B00005YU1M,Randy Keehn,"[5, 7]","This is a different sort of movie; a sort of mixture of ""Affliction"", ""The Green Mile"" and ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"".  The characters are difficult to warm up to which may have been the writer and director's point.  We get plenty of love stories that lead us down the primerose path.  What about a love story about two people who never should have been associated with each other.  Two people whose stars not only didn't cross, they were magnetically repelled from ever even nearing each other.  This is what ""Monster's Ball"" is to me.  In that sense, it is an interesting movie.The characters are rather extreme but, then, that's in keeping with the extreme nature of the message.  Still, it's hard not to be put off a bit because of how disfuctional the main characters are.  By the mid-point of the movie, we know who we DON'T like and the rest of the movie tries to salvage two out of those three.  This change of direction would seem impossible except for the introduction of exteme crises that alter the lives of the people we are reluctant to care about.  We reach the end of the movie shaking our heads but relizing that, in some perverse way, there's someone for everyone.  I'm reminded of the Rolling Stones's song with the lyrics ""You can't always get what you want but if you try sometime, you just might find, you get what you need.""  Not inspiring but a reminder that even scoundrels need someone to hold onto from time to time.

689858,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005YU1M,Reviewer,"[11, 16]","It's very rare, but occasionally a film comes along that plays out so realistically that it doesn't even seem like you're watching a movie, but participating-- albeit as an observer-- in this particular drama of life that is unfolding around you.  And so it is with ""Monster's Ball,"" a riveting film, directed by Marc Forster, that is so real it transcends entertainment and becomes a voyeuristic experience that leaves you with the sense that you've been through everything that's happened yourself.  It's a thought provoking examination of relationships and perspectives, including the ingrained, subjective attitudes-- especially prejudices-- that have such a profound and lasting affect on our lives, as well as the lives of those around us.  It's a film that says so much about the way we respond to one another, as well as certain situations, and why; in short, it's about the world that we, as a society, have created and must live in together-- right or wrong, good or bad, black or white.  And at the heart of the story is a message that rings through loud and true; a perception that we can do better-- and must-- if we are to survive as a civilized, dignified and progressive species.  In the final analysis, we are, all of us, members of the family of Man; and it's time we realize and acknowledge it.After eleven years on death row at a Georgia State Penitentiary, Lawrence Musgrove (Sean Combs) is out of appeals and is headed for the electric chair.  There to make their final visit is Musgrove's wife, Leticia (Halle Berry), and their son, Tyrell (Coronji Calhoun), while veteran corrections officer Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) oversees the proceedings.  Also on hand is third-generation corrections officer Sonny Grotowski (Heath Ledger), who during Musgrove's final walk discovers he doesn't have the stomach required to perform his duties, which will later create some conflict with his father.Bigotry, it seems, is something of a family trait;  Hank's father, Buck (Peter Boyle), a retired corrections officer, is the product of a time when African Americans ""knew their place.""  But it's an attitude that's apparently become somewhat watered down in his family from one generation to the next.  Hank seems almost indifferent, even apathetic, when it comes to race, though under stress, especially, he defers to his father's views.  Sonny, however, has a mind of his own, and by nature is more willing to embrace all of the myriad and diverse aspects of life as he sees it.  And with the three generations of Grotowski men living under one roof, needless to say, there is more than some tension in the household, which inevitably leads to tragedy.Leticia, meanwhile, is riding a downward spiral in her own life, attempting to cope with both her husband's situation and a problem with her son, while having to make a living on top of it all.  And just when it seems that her world is about to fall into total collapse, circumstances bring her into contact with-- of all people-- Hank Grotowski.  Call it fate, or just one of those things; but it becomes a turning point, not only in their lives, but in the lives of a number of people close to them.  And very soon, for Hank and Leticia, especially, the world becomes a very different place.Working from a screenplay by Milo Addica and Will Rokos that is intelligent, incisive and uncompromising, Forster delivers an emotionally absorbing drama that is raw, insightful and presented with a subtle intensity that is so thoroughly engrossing it becomes mesmerizing.  It's a film that does not allow the viewer the luxury of casual observation or an indifferent attitude; the story is told in terms that are so brutally honest and starkly realistic that it does not provide for neutral ground or ambiguity on the part of it's audience.  This is powerful drama, and Forster makes sure that everyone watching has the sense of actually being included as the story unfolds.  He makes you a part of this world in which Hank, Leticia and the others live-- there's no standing on the sidelines with this one.  As in real life, with this film you are confronted with situations that demand resolution and force you to make decisions.It takes a number of elements to make a truly great film, of course, and in this one they all come together beautifully-- especially in the performances, beginning with Billy Bob Thornton, who is without question one of the best leading men/character actors in the business.  He's a true chameleon who never ceases to amaze with his versatility and his ability to create believable, interesting and memorable characters, from Karl (arguably his most memorable) in ""Sling Blade,"" to Jacob in ""A Simple Plan,"" or Russell in ""Pushing Tin"" to Hank in this film, whom he captures with absolutely incredible subtlety and depth.  It's a terrific performance, delivered with nuance and restraint, and it should have earned him an Oscar nomination, as it was clearly one of the best performances of the year.What really takes this film to a higher level, though, is the extraordinary performance by Halle Berry as Leticia, in whom she creates a finely layered, three-dimensional character that is singularly effective and entirely believable and real.  In Leticia, you will find every conceivable emotion woven around conflicts born of the definitive complexities of life, the things we all experience in one way or another at one time or another, and to which everyone will be able to relate on some level, according to personal experience.  In this performance, Berry does it all and gives her all, and it's work for which she deservedly was awarded the Oscar for Best Actress.  When you come away from this film, it's with the indelible images of Leticia and Hank burned into your memory, thanks to the talents of Berry, Thornton and Forster.  ""Monster's Ball"" is compelling, unforgettable drama, and an example of filmmaking at it's best.",5,"Riveting, Realistic Drama",1017532800,"03 31, 2002",2002,5932,"['very', 'rare', 'occasionally',

As you know i don't treat movie actors all that kindly but in Berry's defense she gave one-hell of a performance.

Were the sex scenes really needed to be filmed with Billy Bob and Halle?  I'm not a prude and i have had my share of porn movies, But why did she have to lower herself into doing this in front of a camera.  She has proved herself over and over again in films that she is turly a talented actress.  To me it just cheapend her and the film.  I realize that todays ""Hollywood"" goes into shock value to the audience because most actors can't make it on acting alone and need either special effects or sex to help sell tickets.All in all i give this film a very high mark.

689860,A1GG3J0SNY1BQR,B00005YU1M,Rick,"[3, 6]","As I watched this film, I thought, ""I've been in more than a few neighborhoods like this. Is this what goes on out of earshot of outsiders?"" Well, yes and no. This film represents a rare work of moviemaking in my opinion. It isn't afraid to dwell in the gray areas of life where right and wrong aren't always clearly demarcated. If you like films that stimulate your mind to consider what is possible if not probable, then this film is for you. I'd have to say after two viewings that it is one of the best films I've ever seen. Disregard the reviewers who ridicule the film for its supposed lack of believability. This film requires audiences to transcend their own preconceptions, not suspend their disbelief. Messages abound that are both subtle and raw--a difficult balancing act which succeeds here because of superb camera work, excellent editing and visionary directing. As for the acting, this film has no weak links. I suppose I'll never regard Peter Doyle in quite the same way again when I watch Everybody Loves Raymond. In this film, he shows his true range and convinced me that he was an intractable bigot. Racial tension lacking? Apparently a few reviewers forgot the scene of Leticia's unexpected encounter with Buck. The tension in that scene is palpable. As for Berry, she demonstrates that her range of acting repertoire has yet to be fully tapped. Those critics who have focused on her lovemaking and sensuality have overlooked a lot of this film, perhaps to satisfy their preconceived and patronizing notions about her. The same can be said for Thornton. It's amazing, by the way, how he can play a nutcase, demonstrative auto mechanic in U-Turn and an intelligent but emotionally damaged prison officer in this film.Occasionally, a liberal mindset creeps into this film, but the director doesn't preach, as many reviewers have noted. For example, Lawrence Musgrave is seemingly contrite and reflective in the last moments of his life, almost making us believe he is rehabilitated. But by his own admission he is a bad man, and one which he doesn't want his son to emulate. Those who are against the death penalty would do well to remember that we don't ever find out the nature of his crime nor would it have been any easier on his family if he lived (after all, Leticia has been visiting him for eleven years--nearly as long as their son has been alive--and she has grown tired of the pilgrimage). How can it be any better for her son to know that Daddy will never receive parole?The ending makes it clear that many problems still need to be worked out between the main characters. It is by no means a done deal and Leticia's troubled glances at the tombstones and Hank's face should have been enough to make that clear. For every racist, however, that can't forget or tolerate them, we have to believe there are many others in the community who can forgive and forget (e.g. witness the black mechanic next door).

689867,A3AD071UEP20WS,B00005YU1M,"Roger Long ""longrush""","[4, 6]","This is one of the most over-rated movies I've ever seen.  It is too contrived in plot and too manipulative, particularly with respect to the sex scene between Thornton and Berry.  Consider the following:Billy Bob Thornton plays a racist prison guard who takes a sort of military pride in the structured electrocution of condemned prisoners.  His son, a non-racist guard under him, is not up to the same standard.  A condemned prisoner, the husband of the woman played by Halle Berry, is put to death.Through a convoluted set of circimstances, Thornton takes up with Ms.Berry, after Thornton's son commits suicide and Berry's overweight son is killed in a car accident.  Neither knows of their connection to the electrocuted prisoner until the end of the movie.  The device used to reveal the connection should be obvious to any viewer  Are you following this?For some reason (perhaps the fact that Halle Berry is drop dead gorgeous) Thornton gives up his racism and has an extremely steamy sex scene with the beauteous widow.  Well, that's understandable, but the fact that she is magnificent to look upon is grossly manipulative.  Would Thornton have been so solicitous of her if she had been an average looking African American woman?  I doubt it. Beauty trumps racism.Several movies have been made, through the years, about a racist white becoming liberalized by association with an African American, and in virtually every case the device for attaining this has been so contrived as to make a viewer groan.  In one case a blind white girl falls in love with a very nice black man.  In another case, a racist white is chained to a black man and they have to cooperate to escape pursuers.  In yet another, a white girl brings a black man home to meet her upper class parents--but the black man is a handsome Ivy League surgeon.  Sidney Poitier, a fine actor, was in all of these.In all of these, including Monster's Ball, the devices are just too heavy handed and obvious.  The acting in Monster's Ball is OK, but the story is the problem.  For example, I never believed for a second that the Halle Berry character would have said, ""Make me feel good"" and seduced Thornton.  Why?  I don't object to sexy scenes, per se.  I object when sex scenes are included to titilate the viewer, and that was exactly the case in Monster's Ball.",2,"Oh, come now....",1181692800,"06 13, 2007",2007,2334,"['one', 'most', 'over-rated', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'too', 'contrived', 'plot', 'too', 'manipulative', 'particularly', 'respect', 'sex', 'scene', 'Thornton', 'Berry', 'Consider', 'following', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'racist', 'prison', 'guard', 'who', 'sort', 'military', 'pride', 'structured', 'electrocution', 'condemned', 'prisoners', 'son', 'non-racist', 'guard', 'not', 'up', 'same', 'standard', 'condemned', 'prisoner', 'husband', 'woman', 'played', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'put', 'death.Through', 'convoluted', 'set', 'circimstances', 'Thornton', 'up', 'Ms.Berry', 'Thornton', 'son', 'commits', 'suicide', 'Berry', 'overweight', 'son', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', 'knows', 'connection', 'electrocuted', 'prisoner', 'end', 'movie', 'device', 'used', 'reveal', 'connection', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'viewer', 'Are', 'following', 'reason', 'perhaps', 'fact', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'drop', 'dead', 'gorgeous', 'Thornton', 'up', 'racism', 'extremely', 'steamy', 'sex', 'scene', 'beauteous', 'widow', 'Well', 'understandable', 'fact', 'magnificent', 'look', 'upon', 'grossly', 'manipulative', 'Would', 'Thornton', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'solicitous', 'had', 'been', 'average', 'looking', 'African', 'American', 'woman', 'doubt', 'Beauty', 'trumps', 'racism.Several', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'years', 'racist', 'white', 'becoming', 'liberalized', 'association', 'African', 'American', 'virtually', 'case', 'device', 'attaining', 'been', 'so', 'contrived', 'make', 'viewer', 'groan', 'one', 'case', 'blind', 'white', 'girl', 'love', 'very', 'nice', 'black', 'man', 'case', 'racist', 'white', 'chained', 'black', 'man', 'have', 'cooperate', 'escape', 'pursuers', 'yet', 'white', 'girl', 'black', 'man', 'home', 'meet', 'upper', 'class', 'parents', 'black', 'man', 'handsome', 'Ivy', 'League', 'surgeon', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'fine', 'actor', 'was', 'these.In', 'including', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'devices', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'heavy', 'handed', 'obvious', 'acting', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'OK', 'story', 'problem', 'example', 'never', 'believed', 'second', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'said', 'Make', 'feel', 'good', 'seduced', 'Thornton', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'object', 'sexy', 'scenes', 'se', 'object', 'when', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'included', 'titilate', 'viewer', 'was', 'exactly', 'case', 'Monster', 'Ball']",Monster's Ball

Once you see the similarities between these two films you'll understand how the race card played in the Oscar win in 2002.Both Monster's Ball and Jason's Lyric are set in the Deep South. Both stories are bleak.Both Monster's Ball and Jason's Lyric have troubled primary characters dealing with the death of a loved one Hank Grotowski is dealing with the suicide of his son. Jason is dealing with murdering his own father.Both male leads are emotionally abused by a family member. Hank is abused by his racist father. Jason is abused by his ne'r do well brother who has been released from prison.Both Male leads work in low wage jobs. Hank is a prison guard. Jason is a clerk in a TV repair shop.Both Male leads long for something better. Hank wants to get away from his father. Jason wants to get away from his surroundings.Both Female leads work in a food service establishment. Leticia Musgrove works as a waitress in a diner. Lyric works as a server in a restauraunt.Both lead characters come together as a result of troubling circumstances. Hank and Leticia come together as a result of her husband's execution and the death of her son. Jason and Lyric come together as a result of dealing with his brother's problems.Both films have an obese character. In Monster's Ball it's Leticia's son. In Jason's Lyric the fat person is Lyric's best friend.Both films feature graphic sex scenes. Monster's Ball features a group of graphic sex scenes between Leticia and Hank where Halle Berry gets nude with Billy Bob Thornton. In addition, there's a graphic sex featuring Heath Ledger and a prostitiute. In Jason's Lyric Jason and Lyric have sex out in a feild. In this graphic sex scene Jada Pinkett and Allen Payne both get nude. In additon, Jada and Allen have sex in the TV repair shop. Furthermore the fat girl and Treach get seminude in an alleyway during their sex scene.Both films feature suicides. In Monster's Ball, Heath Ledger's character kills himself. In Jayson's Lyric Bokeem Woodbine's character kills himself.In the end Hank kicks his father out and moves Leticia in. At the end of Jason's Lyric Jason and Lyric finally get on a bus and leave their bleak surroundings once and for all.Both Monster's Ball and Jason's Lyric were made with low budgets.The only difference between these two films is that Jayson's Lyric had an ALL BLACK CAST and a BLACK DIRECTOR and Monster's Ball had a MIXED CAST WITH A FOREIGN DIRECTOR. The critics roasted Jason's Lyric; those same critics years later applauded Monster's Ball a film with the exact same plot as Jason's Lyric a film they bashed. Both Jada Pinkett and Halle Berry were given critical acclaim for their perfomances, but the Academy chose to give Halle Berry the Oscar nomination and the win.Why? The only real difference between these films is the race of the male leads and their family. Billy Bob Thornton was white,and the actors who played his family were white. Allen Payne was black and the actors who played his family were black.Both films were controversial due to a graphic sex scene. Jada Pinkett's ""performance"" in Jason's Lyric was just as ""riveting"" as Halle Berry's in Monster's Ball. However, Jada Pinkett wasn't lauded as a ""trailblazer"" she didn't get to go on Oprah and talk about how powerful a ""love story""Jason's Lyric was, how great an actress she was, and most of all, she got no Oscar nomination. Worse, they were planning on rating Jayson's Lyric X if the sex scene wasn't cut down some. Why? Because Jason's Lyric was a black film made by a black director. Perhaps if Jada Pinkett would have had a graphic sex scene with a white man instead of a Black one she would have been the one holding the gold statue on Oscar night in 1994",1,I liked this better when it was called Jason's Lyric........,1084838400,"05 18, 2004",2004,3832,"['How', 'did', 'Halle', 'play', 'race', 'card', 'Let', 'compare', '2001', 'Monster', 'Ball', '1994', 'Jason', 'Lyric', 'unrated', 'version', 'Once', 'see', 'similarities', 'two', 'films', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'how', 'race', 'card', 'played', 'Oscar', 'win', '2002.Both', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'Jason', 'Lyric', 'are', 'set', 'Deep', 'South', 'stories', 'are', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'Jason', 'Lyric', 'have', 'troubled', 'primary', 'characters', 'dealing', 'death', 'loved', 'one', 'Hank', 'Grotowski', 'dealing', 'suicide', 'son', 'Jason', 'dealing', 'murdering', 'own', 'father.Both', 'male', 'leads', 'are', 'emotionally', 'abused', 'family', 'member', 'Hank', 'abused', 'racist', 'father', 'Jason', 'abused', 'ne', 'r', 'do', 'well', 'brother', 'who', 'been', 'released', 'prison.Both', 'Male', 'work', 'low', 'wage', 'jobs', 'Hank', 'prison', 'guard', 'Jason', 'clerk', 'TV', 'repair', 'Male', 'long', 'something', 'better', 'Hank', 'get', 'away', 'father', 'Jason', 'get', 'away', 'surroundings.Both', 'Female', 'work', 'food', 'service', 'establishment', 'Leticia', 'Musgrove', 'waitress', 'diner', 'Lyric', 'server', 'restauraunt.Both', 'lead', 'characters', 'come', 'together', 'result', 'troubling', 'circumstances', 'Hank', 'Leticia', 'come', 'together', 'result', 'husband', 'execution', 'death', 'son', 'Jason', 'Lyric', 'come', 'together', 'result', 'dealing', 'brother', 'problems.Both', 'films', 'have', 'obese', 'character', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'Leticia', 'son', 'Jason', 'Lyric', 'fat', 'person', 'Lyric', 'best', 'friend.Both', 'films', 'feature', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'group', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Leticia', 'Hank', 'where', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'nude', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'addition', 'graphic', 'sex', 'featuring', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'prostitiute', 'Jason', 'Lyric', 'Jason', 'Lyric', 'have', 'sex', 'out', 'feild', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scene', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'Allen', 'Payne', 'get', 'nude', 'additon', 'Jada', 'Allen', 'have', 'sex', 'TV', 'repair', 'shop', 'fat', 'girl', 'Treach', 'get', 'seminude', 'alleyway', 'sex', 'films', 'feature', 'suicides', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'character', 'Jayson', 'Lyric', 'Bokeem', 'Woodbine', 'character', 'end', 'Hank', 'father', 'moves', 'Leticia', 'end', 'Jason', 'Lyric', 'Jason', 'Lyric', 'finally', 'get', 'bus', 'leave', 'bleak', 'surroundings', 'once', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'Jason', 'Lyric', 'were', 'made', 'low', 'budgets.The', 'only', 'difference', 'two', 'films', 'Jayson', 'Lyric', 'had', 'ALL', 'BLACK', 'CAST', 'BLACK', 'DIRECTOR', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'had', 'MIXED', 'CAST', 'WITH', 'A', 'FOREIGN', 'DIRECTOR', 'critics', 'roasted', 'Jason', 'Lyric', 'same', 'critics', 'years', 'later', 'applauded', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'film', 'exact', 'same', 'plot', 'Jason', 'Lyric', 'film', 'bashed', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'were', 'given', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'perfomances', 'Academy', 'chose', 'give', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'win.Why', 'only', 'real', 'difference', 'films', 'race', 'male', 'leads', 'family', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'was', 'white', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'family', 'were', 'white', 'Allen', 'Payne', 'was', 'black', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'family', 'were', 'black.Both', 'films', 'were', 'controversial', 'due', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scene', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'performance', 'Jason', 'Lyric', 'was', 'just', 'riveting', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'However', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'was', ""n't"", 'lauded', 'trailblazer', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'go', 'Oprah', 'talk', 'how', 'powerful', 'love', 'story', 'Jason', 'Lyric', 'was', 'how', 'great', 'actress', 'was', 'most', 'got', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Worse', 'were', 'planning', 'rating', 'Jayson', 'Lyric', 'X', 'sex', 'scene', 'was', ""n't"", 'cut', 'down', 'Why', 'Jason', 'Lyric', 'was', 'black', 'film', 'made', 'black', 'director', 'Perhaps', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scene', 'white', 'man', 'instead', 'Black', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'holding', 'gold', 'statue', 'Oscar', 'night', '1994']",Monster's Ball
689875,A2B7BUH8834Y6M,B00005YU1M,"Shelley Gammon ""Geek""","[23, 33]","Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) is a career prison guard in a state that still uses the electric chair for its method of execution. His father (Peter Boyle) before him was a prison guard and his son (Heath Ledger) has followed in his footsteps.Hank and his son oversee the execution of a mild-mannered prisoner who has artistic abilities that were never honed or recognized when he was still a free man.  Hank has no idea how he will later be affected by circumstances in the prisoner's family, much less his own.Hank soon loses his son to tragedy, but he's been trained by his own father to not only follow in his footsteps in being a prison guard, but also as being a narrow-minded, bigoted, selfish and repugnant father figure who has never appreciated his own child and almost seems unaffected, if not relieved that his son has died.After the death of his son he has a chance encounter with Leticia (Halle Berry) who has just tragically lost her own son. While the viewer knows who's who, Leticia has no idea that Hank oversaw the execution of her husband (yes, the same one), and he doesn't realize who she is, either.Hank continues to bump into Leticia and gives her rides to her home after her car breaks down... which ultimately leads to one of the wildest sex scenes you will probably ever see in a movie that hasn't been rated X or at least NC-17. The scene is powerful, but is uncomfortably long an it really intensifies the sense that you are a voyeur, if not a participant, in these scenes. It is filmed in such a way, that you feel like you're peeking through the crack of a door... powerful scene, but almost too powerful.The film does not preach... while we see all sorts of things that would be normally highly controversial or at least fodder for a heated debate, none of it is presented as an opinion. You see mixed-race relationships, bigotry, child abuse, obesity, execution and suicide - but the film does not present these topics as though there is a way you should or should not feel about any of these issues and it's up to you to decide how to view & interpret.Halle Berry won a well-deserved Oscar for her performance - and not for the sex scene as some critics have suggested. When Halle Berry acts, she becomes that person - a 3D person, not just a flat character. She does more than put her heart upon her sleeve and if a scene demanded it, she could yank out her own heart and take a bite out of it.The sex scenes alone, in my opinion, should have merited an NC-17 rating. No one under 18 has any business seeing this film... even if their parents are either too [poor] to get a baby sitter or else are too stupid to know better. I get mildly enraged when I see parents sauntering into a movie like this with 8-year olds tagging along. When I saw this film in the theater, there were a number of young people there - none of which should have been exposed to the intense level of violence or explicit sex at such tender ages.Other than my problems w/ the rating, I recommend the film to any adult who wants to see real, raw & unflinching reality and acting at its best.",5,"Raw, Real & Unflinching",1028678400,"08 7, 2002",2002,3094,"['Hank', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'career', 'prison', 'guard', 'state', 'still', 'electric', 'chair', 'method', 'execution', 'father', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'was', 'prison', 'guard', 'son', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'followed', 'footsteps.Hank', 'son', 'execution', 'mild-mannered', 'prisoner', 'who', 'artistic', 'abilities', 'were', 'never', 'honed', 'recognized', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'free', 'man', 'Hank', 'idea', 'how', 'will', 'later', 'be', 'affected', 'circumstances', 'prisoner', 'family', 'much', 'less', 'own.Hank', 'soon', 'son', 'tragedy', 'been', 'trained', 'own', 'father', 'not', 'only', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'being', 'prison', 'guard', 'also', 'being', 'narrow-minded', 'bigoted', 'selfish', 'repugnant', 'father', 'figure', 'who', 'never', 'appreciated', 'own', 'child', 'almost', 'unaffected', 'not', 'relieved', 'son', 'died.After', 'death', 'son', 'chance', 'encounter', 'Leticia', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'who', 'just', 'tragically', 'lost', 'own', 'son', 'viewer', 'who', 'who', 'Leticia', 'idea', 'Hank', 'oversaw', 'execution', 'husband', 'yes', 'same', 'one', ""n't"", 'realize', 'who', 'either.Hank', 'bump', 'Leticia', 'rides', 'home', 'car', 'breaks', 'down', 'ultimately', 'one', 'wildest', 'sex', 'scenes', 'will', 'probably', 'ever', 'see', 'movie', ""n't"", 'been', 'rated', 'X', 'least', 'NC-17', 'scene', 'powerful', 'uncomfortably', 'long', 'really', 'sense', 'are', 'voyeur', 'not', 'participant', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'such', 'way', 'feel', ""'re"", 'peeking', 'crack', 'door', 'powerful', 'scene', 'almost', 'too', 'powerful.The', 'film', 'not', 'preach', 'see', 'sorts', 'things', 'would', 'be', 'normally', 'highly', 'controversial', 'least', 'fodder', 'heated', 'debate', 'none', 'presented', 'opinion', 'see', 'mixed-race', 'relationships', 'bigotry', 'child', 'abuse', 'obesity', 'execution', 'suicide', 'film', 'not', 'present', 'topics', 'way', 'should', 'should', 'not', 'feel', 'issues', 'up', 'decide', 'how', 'view', 'interpret.Halle', 'Berry', 'won', 'well-deserved', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'not', 'sex', 'scene', 'critics', 'have', 'suggested', 'When', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'person', '3D', 'person', 'not', 'just', 'flat', 'character', 'more', 'put', 'heart', 'sleeve', 'scene', 'demanded', 'could', 'yank', 'out', 'own', 'heart', 'take', 'bite', 'it.The', 'sex', 'scenes', 'alone', 'opinion', 'should', 'have', 'merited', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'one', '18', 'business', 'seeing', 'film', 'even', 'parents', 'are', 'either', 'too', '[', 'poor', ']', 'get', 'baby', 'sitter', 'else', 'are', 'too', 'stupid', 'know', 'better', 'get', 'mildly', 'enraged', 'when', 'see', 'parents', 'sauntering', 'movie', '8-year', 'olds', 'tagging', 'along', 'When', 'saw', 'film', 'theater', 'were', 'number', 'young', 'people', 'none', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'exposed', 'intense', 'level', 'violence', 'explicit', 'sex', 'such', 'tender', 'ages.Other', 'problems', 'w/', 'rating', 'recommend', 'film', 'adult', 'who', 'see', 'real', 'raw', 'unflinching', 'reality', 'acting', 'best']",Monster's Ball

689879,A15MLF38WROSWU,B00005YU1M,"S. M. Anderson ""sma331""","[6, 9]","I've finally seen this movie after all this time. I heard so many negative reviews; I was very hesitant to view this movie. When I heard about the movie, the main focus was on the love scene between Halle, and Billy Bob. Well after seeing this movie for myself, I have to say it was a touching film. The movies focal point is on two characters mostly. Leticia Musgrove is a young mother who is dealing with the execution of her husband (played by Sean Combs), one step from evicted and abusive to her son because he is overweight. Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) works at the jail, and he has a racists father, and a son (Heath Ledger) who just wants his fathers love, support and acceptance. Hank and Leticia's lives will collide, surprising them both. Leticia's son is hit by a car in a freak accident, and Hank actually stops (very surprising) to help Leticia get her son to the hospital. The most gripping scene that had me in tears was watching Leticia deal with her grief of losing her son. Watching her hit the glass, screaming and crying; I could not help but cry right along with her. I felt Leticia's grief, and it was then I realized that Halle deserved her academy reward. Halle played her character so well I felt her resentment towards her husband having to support her son on her own; I felt her grief of losing both her husband and her son. You feel her desperation when she realizes she is losing her home, and you feel her vulnerability when she is seeking the attention that is so elusive to her.It's never explained what crime was committed for Leticia's husband to be on death row. Another scene that really got to me was the scene when Hank is burying his son and he says &quot;the only sound I want to hear is the dirt hitting his casket.&quot; You are amazed at how unfeeling and insensitive he is. Hank and Leticia end up filling voids they both have in their lives. Sony (Heath Ledger) you get the sense that he is trying to find his own place in life, and he does not want to be like his father and grandfather. He is quiet, sad, and just existing simply to exist. His father &quot;claims&quot; he does not love him, and that's all Sony wanted. He wanted his father's love. This movie had simple messages:1 You never know when you will find love.2. From bad can eventually come some good.The big deal over the characters love scene was so uncalled for. Why people saw that scene as one step from porn is beyond me. Leticia was grieving, and she wanted even for a few minuets forget her pain, forget her life was not good, and she wanted to feel good. She wanted for those few minuets feels special, and that's what that scene was about. It was about both of them forgetting their pain, and they sought comfort in one another.This film displays family dysfunctions for these two characters, and by the end of the film Hand and Leticia find something that's unexpected. This film was really. Gripping performances by everyone who starred in the film. Mos Def had a small role as the father of two sons who were friends with Sony. Even his small part was good. Peter Boyle played his part so well, that I was overjoyed when his son sent him away. I had no sympathy for him at all. This is a good film, that if you have an open mind, you will feel the raw emotion.",4,"Gripping performances, and a touching film",1091145600,"07 30, 2004",2004,3281,"[""'ve"", 'finally', 'seen', 'movie', 'time', 'heard', 'so', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'was', 'very', 'hesitant', 'view', 'movie', 'When', 'heard', 'movie', 'main', 'focus', 'was', 'love', 'scene', 'Halle', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Well', 'seeing', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'touching', 'film', 'movies', 'focal', 'point', 'two', 'characters', 'mostly', 'Leticia', 'Musgrove', 'young', 'mother', 'who', 'dealing', 'execution', 'husband', 'played', 'Sean', 'Combs', 'one', 'step', 'evicted', 'abusive', 'son', 'overweight', 'Hank', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'jail', 'racists', 'father', 'son', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'who', 'just', 'fathers', 'love', 'support', 'acceptance', 'Hank', 'Leticia', 'lives', 'will', 'collide', 'surprising', 'Leticia', 'son', 'hit', 'car', 'freak', 'accident', 'Hank', 'actually', 'very', 'surprising', 'help', 'Leticia', 'get', 'son', 'hospital', 'most', 'gripping', 'scene', 'had', 'tears', 'was', 'watching', 'Leticia', 'deal', 'grief', 'losing', 'son', 'Watching', 'hit', 'glass', 'screaming', 'crying', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'cry', 'right', 'along', 'felt', 'Leticia', 'grief', 'was', 'then', 'realized', 'Halle', 'deserved', 'academy', 'reward', 'Halle', 'played', 'character', 'so', 'well', 'felt', 'resentment', 'husband', 'having', 'support', 'son', 'own', 'felt', 'grief', 'losing', 'husband', 'son', 'feel', 'desperation', 'when', 'losing', 'home', 'feel', 'vulnerability', 'when', 'seeking', 'attention', 'so', 'elusive', 'her.It', 'never', 'explained', 'what', 'crime', 'was', 'committed', 'Leticia', 'husband', 'be', 'death', 'row', 'scene', 'really', 'got', 'was', 'scene', 'when', 'Hank', 'burying', 'son', 'quot', 'only', 'sound', 'want', 'hear', 'dirt', 'hitting', 'casket.', 'quot', 'are', 'amazed', 'how', 'unfeeling', 'insensitive', 'Hank', 'Leticia', 'end', 'up', 'filling', 'voids', 'have', 'lives', 'Sony', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'get', 'sense', 'trying', 'find', 'own', 'place', 'life', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'father', 'grandfather', 'quiet', 'sad', 'just', 'existing', 'simply', 'exist', 'father', 'quot', 'claims', 'quot', 'not', 'love', 'Sony', 'wanted', 'wanted', 'father', 'love', 'movie', 'had', 'simple', 'messages:1', 'never', 'know', 'when', 'will', 'find', 'love.2', 'bad', 'can', 'eventually', 'come', 'good.The', 'big', 'deal', 'characters', 'love', 'scene', 'was', 'so', 'uncalled', 'Why', 'people', 'saw', 'scene', 'one', 'step', 'porn', 'Leticia', 'was', 'grieving', 'wanted', 'even', 'few', 'minuets', 'forget', 'pain', 'forget', 'life', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'wanted', 'feel', 'good', 'wanted', 'few', 'minuets', 'feels', 'special', 'what', 'scene', 'was', 'about', 'was', 'forgetting', 'pain', 'sought', 'comfort', 'one', 'another.This', 'film', 'displays', 'family', 'dysfunctions', 'two', 'characters', 'end', 'film', 'Hand', 'Leticia', 'find', 'something', 'unexpected', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'Gripping', 'performances', 'everyone', 'who', 'starred', 'film', 'Mos', 'Def', 'had', 'small', 'role', 'father', 'two', 'sons', 'who', 'were', 'friends', 'Sony', 'Even', 'small', 'part', 'was', 'good', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'played', 'part', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'overjoyed', 'when', 'son', 'sent', 'away', 'had', 'sympathy', 'good', 'film', 'have', 'open', 'mind', 'will', 'feel', 'raw', 'emotion']",Monster's Ball

Berry in particular sheds her usual one-note theatrics to inhabit a character so blisteringly real it's almost impossible to believe this is the same actress that made ""Swordfish""; she deservedly won an Academy Award for her portrayal here.  Peter Boyle and Heath Ledger give effective performances in smaller roles, and even P. Diddy himself manages to do more than stare blankly with mouth agape.  The Raymond Carver-esque story intertwines a series of tragedies stemming from an execution, all of which could become camp if it weren't for the capable approach of director Marc Forster.  Though the plot is pretty thin--the only real weakness to the film--characters and performances are strong enough to keep the momentum going.  Even the infamous steamy sex scene packs a wallop, both for its gutsiness and for the savvy of the actors (the lovely Berry again deserves kudos for finding the emotional center of her character in what might otherwise have seemed an exploitative scene).

Halle Berry absolutely deserved her Oscar for her portrayal of Leticia Musgrove, the Death Row widow who enters into an unlikely relationship with Hank Grotowski, played by Billy Bob Thornton. This was not a ""political"" choice, i.e. because she happens to be black. Her character was a black woman, okay? I can't even remember the other actresses who were up for the Best Actress Award. Anyway, the Academy got that one right. But in truth, this film should have won Best Picture, Best Director (for Mark Forster) and probably best supporting actor, for Heath Ledger, even though his character dies early on in the film. But the subject matter of this film (black man is executed, widow falls in love with a white man) just wasn't ""appropriate"" enough to give it the high visibility of those other awards. Better give them to a superficial, ""unreal"" concoction that is ""A Beautiful Mind"", a feel-good movie if there ever was one. Don't get me wrong, I though Russell Crowe did an outstanding job in that film; but, ""Monster's Ball"" is about the hard truthes of life, death and love in an unequal society, told with unflinching realism. Sean Combs did an outstanding job (for a non-actor) as the condemned man, Leticia's husband, and his scenes leading up to the execution are some of the most powerful ones in the film.  As a native southerner, I actually thought that the racism was toned way down, and that is my only real criticism of the movie.

Its a shame the media sensationalized the notorious love scene before and during the theatrical release because it was only a part of the story. The emphasis wasn't really on the sex act but a vehicle for the two characters to vent their emotions and feelings about the tragic events in their lives. A very powerful scene in the car (before Leticia asks Hank to come inside) where Hank had a hard time getting the words out while explaining why he helped Leticia and her son. He had to come to grips with his own humanity (rather than his racist roots) and the feelings he started to feel for her.

That way, your chances of ending up with something you find offensive will be a lot less.  Believe me, I've been to the video rental store lots of times and this technique really works.We need more films with adult-oriented themes and less teenage-oriented garbage.

The characters weren't tremendously likeable, but they behaved in understandable terms.  In other words, the decisions the characters made, and the consequences of their actions, set in motion a series of events that made the story convincing.The only problem I had with the film was that someone as glamorous-looking as Halle Berry probably wouldn't be living such a bummy existence, not even in the deep South.  But, that's poetic license.  The casting of Halle Berry made the part more believeable.  The expression on her face at the film's end contributed to an ending that was powerful, poetic, and hopeful.

Billy Bob Thornton plays Hank, a prison guard who has an adult son (an impressive Heath Ledger) and takes care of his boorish, redneck father.  Halle Berry is Leticia, a woman whose husband (a very good Sean Combs) is on death row, can't seem to hold down a job, and vents her frustrations on her obese young son.  Neither Hank nor Leticia is a very good parent, and they come from two entirely different backgrounds.  But on one rainy evening, they cross paths with each other, and from there a relationship begins.  However, what Leticia doesn't know is that Hank was one of the people who assisted her husband's execution.  And, as with almost all interracial relationships, tension rises between them, and Hank is forced to confront his racist demons.This is a very upsetting movie, and the material deals with some very volatile issues.  But it soars on the strength of the performances.  The spotlight is clearly Halle's, who rightfully earned her Oscar.  An actress known for her beauty, she de-glamed herself in this gritty performance, and she pulled it off without faking a single move.  But props also has to go to Billy Bob Thornton, who gives a dynamite performance as well.  Following ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" Thornton is on a roll, and is becoming one of the finest actors in the last ten years.

They do not have any depth of acting. Actresses like Jodie Foster and Emma Thompson have overall ability and are able to act in different roles with aplomb. Now let us see the story in this movie, a racist person who changes over time and falls in love with an afro-american. She abuses her son for being fat and falls in love with the white person. Apart from small moments, there are very few moments of great acting. Seeing the other movies that she has played it like Tomorrow Never Dies, Catwoman (she was offered a place in Gigli), you can see how shallow her roles are.

A deeper look at capital punishment, a deeper look at race relations.  Instead these subjects only get treated superficially at best.

I have to admit that her performance was just as good or better than the actresses who usually get the Oscar...but then again, the Academy often makes poor choices for these awards (no way Tom Hanks should ever get an Oscar).  Naomi Watts of ""Mulholland Drive"" should have gotten the award but, as usual, the best films and actors dont get recognized at the Oscars.Awarding an Oscar to Halle Berry is just a cosmetic approach to the racism in Hollywood.  The way to correct the problem is to give better roles to deserving minority actors and actresses.I am in no way a proponent of having sex and violence taken out of movies, however, this movie used the sex scenes gratuitously, obviously trying to appeal to voyeurs who get off on seeing a black female and a white male engaging in intercourse.What word best sums up the ending?

Mercy, what was the Academy thinking on that choice?  I thought her performance was unnatural and contrived, and not aided by the fact that her stunning beauty belied her otherwise down and out status (I'm only willing to suspend disbelief to a certain point).As for the film itself, it grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go.  The mood it establishes, supported by an excellent musical score, almost hypnotizes you.  I was disappointed by the ending, however.

The performances by Thornton and Berry are absolutely superb and are really at the heart of what makes this film work, and even Ledger and Combs do very good jobs with their supporting roles.  At times the plot is a bit rushed and unrealistic, but these performances manage to keep the whole thing afloat during these few moments when the plot falters a bit.The film itself deals with many serious issues including racism, capital punishment, interracial couples and death, and while there is certainly strong commentary presented on these topics, the film does a good job of not becoming preachy in its sentiments.  Underlying all of these more obvious issues are the more personal and character driven issues dealt with by the main characters.  Thornton is a man struggling to find himself and his true identity while attempting to finally escape the legacy of bigotry and ignorance handed down to him by his father.  Meanwhile, Berry's character undergoes a transformation spurred on by pain and personal loss and the effort to cope with her position as a black woman in the south.  Together, the two characters are able to scrape beneath the surface of who society percieves them to be by getting in touch with their own, and each other's, basic humanity.  Through a combination of overwhelming pain and strength, loss and gain, they experience a rebirth into a new life.

689900,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005YU1M,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","Lions Gate Films, which gave us very original films like Vincent Gallo's &quot;Buffallo 66,&quot; again offers a stunning independent film.  Before you watch this, prepare for the following facts: 1) it is a romance, but a kind of romance that may shock some of us.  There's nudity and an intense love scene.  2) The script is apparently not so great, but the director Marc Forster uses it as a backdrop to tell the story very silently.  Some may call it boring, but I just don't share that view.  Here's the reason.Because the overall feeling of the film resembles that of European films, giving minute details to show the inner feelings of the complicated characters.  Look at how Billy Bob washes and cleans one thing which brought a terrible result.  Or, how he orders a cup of coffee at a diner.  Those small descriptions add up to the realistic portraits of the two leads, and in spite of the obvious flaws of the script, those details, if noticed, would slowly draw the viewers into the world of the film, which, set in Georgia, USA, goes on as if respectfully detached from the two leads.  But that European storytelling doesn't come as a big surprise at all because the director is born in Switzerland.As many reviewers justly complain, the plot is far-fetched, to be sure.  Billy Bob Thornton's character Hank, being respected while working at a prison as an officier, is a politically uncorrect guy, but not as much as his father.  Hank's son Sonny (Heath Ledger), more liberal-minded, so to speak, also works at the same place, but at the execution scene of a convict (Sean Combs), this son greatly disappoints the conservative Hank.Then, next morning, follows a string of tragedies (very violent, I warn).  But he is not the only one who suffers.  He later happens to get acquainted with Afro-American widow Leticia (Halle Berry) working at a diner, who had experienced (perhaps) more horrible things recently.  Out of their mutual compassion comes unexpected love, but is there any possibility that this most unlikely pair would get along with each other?Don't expect any definite answers to the issues about races or capital penalty here.  This is basicaly a love story, and should be seen as that.  And the film avoids using many dialogues intentionally -- this is a wise decision for, as you see, there are some coincidences that stretch the credibility of the story.  The director only uses the script as a springboard for actors to be the characters, but nothing more.As a result, two elements greatly help the film deliver: one is of course the acting.  Billy Bob is excellent; he is a kind of actor who can convey the character's any kind of emotions without saying anything, and he does it again.  Halle Berry is superb, completely leaving behind the rather humiliating role in &quot;Swordfish.&quot;  Heath Ledger is also good, but sorry, his fans, his screen time is shorter than you might expect.  (Wes Bentley, his co-star in &quot;Four Feathers&quot; was originally supposed to be in Sonny's role, but he bailed out because of the fatigue coming during the filming.)Please remember, this is not an easy ride; when it is depressing, it is unflinchingly, ruthlessly depressing, but they have made a point.  As the story unfolds, the film slowly gets calmer, showing the tender side of those characters living in turmoil.  Watch it like you watch the films like &quot;Slingblade.&quot;  It's slow, and sometimes incredible, but at the same time rewarding if you accept its dismal and intense aspects.",4,"Sometimes Dismal, But Always a Strong Love Story",1032912000,"09 25, 2002",2002,3524,"['Lions', 'Gate', 'Films', 'gave', 'very', 'original', 'films', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'quot', 'Buffallo', '66', 'quot', 'again', 'stunning', 'independent', 'film', 'watch', 'prepare', 'following', 'facts', '1', 'romance', 'kind', 'romance', 'may', 'shock', 'nudity', 'intense', 'love', 'scene', '2', 'script', 'apparently', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'director', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'backdrop', 'tell', 'story', 'very', 'silently', 'may', 'call', 'boring', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'share', 'view', 'Here', 'reason.Because', 'overall', 'feeling', 'film', 'European', 'films', 'giving', 'minute', 'details', 'show', 'inner', 'feelings', 'complicated', 'characters', 'Look', 'how', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'washes', 'one', 'thing', 'brought', 'terrible', 'result', 'how', 'orders', 'cup', 'coffee', 'diner', 'small', 'descriptions', 'add', 'up', 'realistic', 'portraits', 'two', 'leads', 'spite', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'script', 'details', 'noticed', 'would', 'slowly', 'draw', 'viewers', 'world', 'film', 'set', 'Georgia', 'USA', 'respectfully', 'detached', 'two', 'leads', 'European', 'storytelling', ""n't"", 'come', 'big', 'surprise', 'director', 'born', 'Switzerland.As', 'many', 'reviewers', 'justly', 'complain', 'plot', 'far-fetched', 'be', 'sure', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'character', 'Hank', 'being', 'respected', 'working', 'prison', 'officier', 'politically', 'uncorrect', 'guy', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'father', 'Hank', 'son', 'Sonny', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'more', 'liberal-minded', 'so', 'speak', 'also', 'same', 'place', 'execution', 'scene', 'convict', 'Sean', 'Combs', 'son', 'greatly', 'conservative', 'Hank.Then', 'next', 'morning', 'string', 'tragedies', 'very', 'violent', 'warn', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'later', 'get', 'acquainted', 'Afro-American', 'widow', 'Leticia', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'working', 'diner', 'who', 'had', 'experienced', 'perhaps', 'more', 'horrible', 'things', 'recently', 'mutual', 'compassion', 'unexpected', 'love', 'there', 'possibility', 'most', 'unlikely', 'pair', 'would', 'get', 'other', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'definite', 'answers', 'issues', 'races', 'capital', 'penalty', 'here', 'love', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'film', 'avoids', 'using', 'many', 'dialogues', 'intentionally', 'wise', 'decision', 'see', 'are', 'coincidences', 'stretch', 'credibility', 'story', 'director', 'only', 'script', 'springboard', 'actors', 'be', 'characters', 'nothing', 'more.As', 'result', 'two', 'elements', 'greatly', 'help', 'film', 'deliver', 'one', 'course', 'acting', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'excellent', 'kind', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'convey', 'character', 'kind', 'emotions', 'saying', 'anything', 'again', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'superb', 'completely', 'leaving', 'rather', 'humiliating', 'role', 'quot', 'Swordfish.', 'quot', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'also', 'good', 'sorry', 'fans', 'screen', 'time', 'shorter', 'might', 'expect', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'co-star', 'quot', 'Four', 'Feathers', 'quot', 'was', 'originally', 'supposed', 'be', 'Sonny', 'role', 'bailed', 'out', 'fatigue', 'coming', 'filming', 'Please', 'remember', 'not', 'easy', 'ride', 'when', 'depressing', 'unflinchingly', 'ruthlessly', 'depressing', 'have', 'made', 'point', 'story', 'unfolds', 'film', 'slowly', 'calmer', 'showing', 'tender', 'side', 'characters', 'living', 'turmoil', 'Watch', 'watch', 'films', 'quot', 'Slingblade.', 'quot', 'slow', 'sometimes', 'incredible', 'same', 'time', 'rewarding', 'accept', 'dismal', 'intense', 'aspects']",Monster's Ball

I saw a few scenes on HBO, and thought it was interesting, intriguing, and hot. But then when i rented it and watched the WHOLE film, i was left wondering what's the big deal? First of all, the plot of this whole movie was lacking depth, and later on doesn't even seem to have a point to it. And Halle Barry's make up, or lack of it, was nothing special, she still looked like the same Halle Barry to me, except with a country accent. Don't get me wrong, i think Halle Barry is a great actress, and she deserved her Academy Award, but i don't understand what was so special about this role for her to finally get recognized for her talent.

689905,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,B00005YU1M,William Hare,"[8, 10]","""Monster's Ball"" involves some of the hottest romantic chemistry ever present on screen.  The sizzling cauldron of sparks between Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton helped to result in the former securing the first ever Best Actress Academy Award for an African American.The drama directed by Sundance Festival success story Marc Forester reveals a strong character arc by white Southerner Thornton to overcome previous prejudice and ultimately find love with Berry, a result developing from second chances of two people seeking to rebound from comparable tragedies.Thornton plays the middle layer of the Grotowski family.  His father, played by Peter Boyle, is an inveterate racist segregationist dying from emphysema.  Thornton's son, played by Heath Ledger, is a sensitive young man with liberal racial views.  Boyle is a retired prison guard, the same job his son and grandson hold.When Boyle observes two African American youngsters on their property in front of the rural Georgia home where they live, Thornton is commanded to evict them.  He does so after they explain they have come to visit his son Sonny, played by Ledger.  He fires his shotgun into the air so they will get the point that they are unwelcome.Eventually a confrontation between father and son regarding Ledger's liberal attitude toward African American death row prisoners results in Ledger, after pistol whipping his father, turning the gun on himself and committing suicide.The death changes Thornton, who promptly resigns his post, haunted by having, in a state of anger, uttered as the final words to his son, ""I hate you.""  Ledger's final words to his father before killing himself are, ""I always loved you.""At this juncture Thornton meets Berry, picking her up by the side of the road on a rainy night after her son has been badly injured by a hit and run driver.  This comes not long after her husband, who had spent 11 years on death row, has been executed.  Thornton drives Berry and her son to the hospital, where he dies.Two people immersed in tragedy then find love in a daring relationship, given the propensities of many in the small rural Southern town.  Berry and Thornton appreciably grow in direct proportion to their bond of love.  This is a daring film in which two people rise to new levels of awareness as a result of their dynamic interaction and desire to please one another.",5,"Red Hot Chemistry, an Oscar for Halle",1018828800,"04 15, 2002",2002,2375,"['Monster', 'Ball', 'hottest', 'romantic', 'chemistry', 'ever', 'present', 'screen', 'sizzling', 'cauldron', 'sparks', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'helped', 'result', 'former', 'securing', 'first', 'ever', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Academy', 'Award', 'African', 'American.The', 'drama', 'directed', 'Sundance', 'Festival', 'success', 'story', 'Marc', 'Forester', 'strong', 'character', 'arc', 'white', 'Southerner', 'Thornton', 'overcome', 'previous', 'prejudice', 'ultimately', 'find', 'love', 'Berry', 'result', 'developing', 'second', 'chances', 'two', 'people', 'seeking', 'rebound', 'comparable', 'tragedies.Thornton', 'middle', 'layer', 'Grotowski', 'family', 'father', 'played', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'inveterate', 'racist', 'segregationist', 'dying', 'emphysema', 'Thornton', 'son', 'played', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'sensitive', 'young', 'man', 'liberal', 'racial', 'views', 'Boyle', 'retired', 'prison', 'guard', 'same', 'job', 'son', 'grandson', 'hold.When', 'Boyle', 'two', 'African', 'American', 'youngsters', 'property', 'front', 'rural', 'Georgia', 'home', 'where', 'live', 'Thornton', 'commanded', 'evict', 'so', 'explain', 'have', 'come', 'visit', 'son', 'Sonny', 'played', 'Ledger', 'shotgun', 'air', 'will', 'get', 'point', 'are', 'unwelcome.Eventually', 'confrontation', 'father', 'son', 'regarding', 'Ledger', 'liberal', 'attitude', 'African', 'American', 'death', 'row', 'prisoners', 'results', 'Ledger', 'pistol', 'whipping', 'father', 'turning', 'gun', 'committing', 'suicide.The', 'death', 'changes', 'Thornton', 'who', 'promptly', 'post', 'haunted', 'having', 'state', 'anger', 'uttered', 'final', 'words', 'son', 'hate', 'Ledger', 'final', 'words', 'father', 'killing', 'are', 'always', 'loved', 'juncture', 'Thornton', 'Berry', 'picking', 'up', 'side', 'road', 'rainy', 'night', 'son', 'been', 'badly', 'injured', 'hit', 'run', 'driver', 'not', 'long', 'husband', 'who', 'had', 'spent', '11', 'years', 'death', 'row', 'been', 'executed', 'Thornton', 'Berry', 'son', 'hospital', 'where', 'people', 'immersed', 'tragedy', 'then', 'find', 'love', 'daring', 'relationship', 'given', 'propensities', 'many', 'small', 'rural', 'Southern', 'town', 'Berry', 'Thornton', 'appreciably', 'grow', 'direct', 'proportion', 'bond', 'love', 'daring', 'film', 'two', 'people', 'rise', 'new', 'levels', 'awareness', 'result', 'dynamic', 'interaction', 'desire', 'please', 'one']",Monster's Ball

689908,A2LXTAXALKOQSG,B00005YU1M,"Za'chary Westbrook ""Jericho""","[15, 28]","Indeed, I must agree with so many other reviewers that this was one of the most moving films I've ever seen: it moved my feet straight out the room. It also moved my stomach in ways that shouldn't be discussed in public forum. My eyelids were also moved STRAIGHT DOWN. About the only thing that didn't move was the plot. My girlfriend made me watch it in return for making her watch 'Vanilla Sky', and the only way I could survive was by throwing in frequent jibes. Most of which ran along the lines of 'was that supposed to be a plot point?' 'Well, my life is a hollow lie' and 'Eeeeennnnndddd' and then it did, and I was left totally bewildered.Okay, before I get blown off as some uncultured moron who can't wait for Steven Seagal's next film, I'd like to say that I was actually optimistic about this one. It got solid reviews from people who have loved great films like 'Mulholland Dr' and 'Memento'. And I do enjoy a well crafted romance story like 'What Women Want' and 'The Bachelor'. But this was neither well-crafted or romantic. If films had an EKG, this sucker flat-lined about ten minutes in when Heath Ledger shoots himself ('was that supposed to be a plot point?'). The 'plot' itself was less substantial than a twinkie. Billy Bob Thornton (I'm sorry but I can't take this man seriously) plays a Corrections Officer, something my Dad has done in real life for a number of years. Ledger is his son, Sonny (boucoup points in the creative naming there), who is appearantly searching for a fullfilling relationship but his upbringing hasn't taught him how to find it. I say 'appearantly' because the entirety of his part is a quick romp with some random girl, botching Puffy Combs' execution, being yelled at by Thornton, then shooting himself for no appearant reason. The purile love story between Thornton and Halle Berry (whose carreer has been a long line of miracles of mediocrity) is so utterly simplistic, yet insanely complicated that it feels like a High school romance rather than an adult relationship. Maybe that was the point, but how is that entertaining? Berry tries vainly to get her son to let go of his father, Combs, by drawing his focus to his own short-comings. She focuses her own sorrow into getting him to loose weight for about five seconds, by slapping him around for eating chocolate. Thornton broods around because the son he hated is dead? ('Well, my life is a hollow lie') Then he and Berry start their 60s-esque High School romance, then they sleep together in a scen that is so dark (visually) that I couldn't tell if it was supposed to be sexy or a dark cave. Suddenly Berry's son is gone. He just disappears off the face of the Earth. Which is okay because he served no purpose whatsoever (much like the rest of the characters). Just as I'm screaming 'End' at my TV Thornton sits on the porch, rubs Berry's back and says 'It'll b okay' then the credits rolled and I had no idea what happened. The ending was so abrupt I wondered if the DVD had a scratch and had skipped a bunch of stuff. Nope, it just ended that way.Basically, I'm still trying to figure out why in the name of everything good and pure this film was made. I realize that this is a pretty acurate portrayal of actual lives, but so what? Are people's personal lives really so dull and meaningless that this is the proxy they choose to add meaning to their grind? There are lots of real lives out there, why make a movie about the hopelessly immature and miserable? I'm sorry, but the endless pain and suffering of my fellow human beings is not entertainment, it's sadistic. This movie had no meaning, no artistic vision. Granted it was directed by a Swede, so I can't be too hard on it. But this film is to be skipped, buried, and remembered only by Mystery Science Theater 3000.",1,An incredibly moving film,1043280000,"01 23, 2003",2003,3789,"['Indeed', 'must', 'agree', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'moved', 'feet', 'straight', 'out', 'room', 'also', 'moved', 'stomach', 'ways', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'discussed', 'public', 'forum', 'eyelids', 'were', 'also', 'moved', 'STRAIGHT', 'DOWN', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'move', 'was', 'plot', 'girlfriend', 'made', 'watch', 'return', 'making', 'watch', ""'Vanilla"", 'Sky', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'survive', 'was', 'throwing', 'frequent', 'jibes', 'Most', 'ran', 'lines', ""'was"", 'supposed', 'be', 'plot', 'point', ""'Well"", 'life', 'hollow', 'lie', ""'Eeeeennnnndddd"", 'then', 'did', 'was', 'left', 'totally', 'bewildered.Okay', 'get', 'blown', 'off', 'uncultured', 'moron', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'next', 'film', ""'d"", 'like', 'say', 'was', 'actually', 'optimistic', 'one', 'got', 'solid', 'reviews', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'loved', 'great', 'films', ""'Mulholland"", 'Dr', ""'Memento"", 'do', 'enjoy', 'well', 'crafted', 'romance', 'story', ""'What"", 'Women', 'Want', ""'The"", 'Bachelor', 'was', 'well-crafted', 'romantic', 'films', 'had', 'EKG', 'sucker', 'flat-lined', 'ten', 'minutes', 'when', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'shoots', 'supposed', 'be', 'plot', 'point', ""'plot"", 'was', 'less', 'substantial', 'twinkie', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'man', 'seriously', 'Corrections', 'Officer', 'something', 'Dad', 'done', 'real', 'life', 'number', 'years', 'Ledger', 'son', 'Sonny', 'boucoup', 'points', 'creative', 'naming', 'there', 'who', 'appearantly', 'searching', 'fullfilling', 'relationship', 'upbringing', ""n't"", 'taught', 'how', 'find', 'say', ""'appearantly"", 'entirety', 'part', 'quick', 'romp', 'random', 'girl', 'botching', 'Puffy', 'Combs', 'execution', 'being', 'yelled', 'Thornton', 'then', 'shooting', 'appearant', 'reason', 'purile', 'love', 'story', 'Thornton', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'carreer', 'been', 'long', 'line', 'miracles', 'mediocrity', 'so', 'utterly', 'simplistic', 'yet', 'insanely', 'complicated', 'High', 'school', 'romance', 'rather', 'adult', 'relationship', 'Maybe', 'was', 'point', 'how', 'entertaining', 'Berry', 'vainly', 'get', 'son', 'let', 'go', 'father', 'Combs', 'drawing', 'focus', 'own', 'short-comings', 'own', 'sorrow', 'getting', 'loose', 'weight', 'about', 'five', 'seconds', 'slapping', 'around', 'eating', 'chocolate', 'Thornton', 'broods', 'around', 'son', 'hated', 'dead', ""'Well"", 'life', 'hollow', 'lie', 'Then', 'Berry', 'start', '60s-esque', 'High', 'School', 'romance', 'then', 'sleep', 'together', 'scen', 'so', 'dark', 'visually', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'sexy', 'dark', 'cave', 'Suddenly', 'Berry', 'son', 'gone', 'just', 'face', 'Earth', 'Which', 'okay', 'served', 'purpose', 'whatsoever', 'much', 'rest', 'characters', 'Just', ""'m"", 'screaming', ""'End"", 'TV', 'Thornton', 'porch', 'rubs', 'Berry', 'back', ""'It"", ""'ll"", 'b', 'okay', 'then', 'credits', 'rolled', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'happened', 'ending', 'was', 'so', 'abrupt', 'wondered', 'DVD', 'had', 'scratch', 'had', 'skipped', 'bunch', 'stuff', 'Nope', 'just', 'ended', 'way.Basically', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'name', 'everything', 'good', 'pure', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'realize', 'pretty', 'acurate', 'portrayal', 'actual', 'lives', 'so', 'what', 'Are', 'people', 'personal', 'lives', 'really', 'so', 'dull', 'meaningless', 'proxy', 'choose', 'add', 'meaning', 'grind', 'are', 'lots', 'real', 'lives', 'there', 'why', 'make', 'movie', 'hopelessly', 'immature', 'miserable', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'endless', 'pain', 'suffering', 'fellow', 'human', 'beings', 'not', 'entertainment', 'sadistic', 'movie', 'had', 'meaning', 'artistic', 'vision', 'Granted', 'was', 'directed', 'Swede', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'hard', 'film', 'be', 'skipped', 'buried', 'remembered', 'only', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000']",Monster's Ball
