1041242,A2MNB9PF4QMK9P,B000LXGXY8,"givbatam3 ""givbatam3""","[38, 44]","It was in this season that the series had many of its finest episodes.Although there is no such thing as a ""bad"" episode of Rockford Files, and I would give five stars to each season, it was in this season that series really hit its stride. In the first season, most episodes were about Rockford helping some beautiful ""damsel in distress"", even ones who get involved  with mobsters.  In the second season, we see Jim getting into serious trouble frequently because he allows himself to be used as a patsy, even by close friends, and frankly, this sometimes gets on my nerves, even if it is by the otherwise lovable Angel Martin (it should be pointed out that the audience didn't care for this either since the ratings for the show declined during that season). However, in Season 3 there was a major turnaround.  We now see stories about Jim encountering real problems and real abuses people have with the police and other institutions who often abuse their power. For example, there is the two-part episode ""The Bees, the Trees and T T Flowers"" where Strother Martin puts in a fine performance of a eccentric older man who is falsely declared senile and incompetant in order to gain control of his property.  Another excellent two-parter is ""To Protect and to Serve"" where Joyce Van Patten plays a lonely, bitter woman who's only pleasure in life is hanging around the police (who mistakenly allow it) and secretly enjoying seeing other peoples' tragedies. Another episode, which is James Garner's favorite is one where he is jailed for contempt of court, showing the abuses of the District Attorney's powers to compel people to testify, in defiance of their concience. It was also in this season the Rockford's biggest police nemesis, Lt Chapman, is introduced.If someone wants a good introduction to the series, I would recommend this as the first DVD set to purchase.",5,"Season Three-""The Rockford Files"" Develops a Social Concience",1172102400,"02 22, 2007",2007,1872,"['was', 'season', 'series', 'had', 'many', 'finest', 'such', 'thing', 'bad', 'episode', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'would', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'season', 'was', 'season', 'series', 'really', 'hit', 'stride', 'first', 'season', 'most', 'episodes', 'were', 'Rockford', 'helping', 'beautiful', 'damsel', 'distress', 'even', 'ones', 'who', 'get', 'involved', 'mobsters', 'second', 'season', 'see', 'Jim', 'getting', 'serious', 'trouble', 'frequently', 'be', 'used', 'patsy', 'even', 'close', 'friends', 'frankly', 'nerves', 'even', 'otherwise', 'lovable', 'Angel', 'Martin', 'should', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'audience', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'ratings', 'show', 'declined', 'season', 'However', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'major', 'turnaround', 'now', 'see', 'stories', 'Jim', 'encountering', 'real', 'problems', 'real', 'abuses', 'people', 'have', 'police', 'other', 'institutions', 'who', 'often', 'abuse', 'power', 'example', 'two-part', 'episode', 'Bees', 'Trees', 'T', 'T', 'Flowers', 'where', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'fine', 'performance', 'eccentric', 'older', 'man', 'who', 'falsely', 'declared', 'senile', 'incompetant', 'order', 'gain', 'control', 'property', 'excellent', 'two-parter', 'Protect', 'Serve', 'where', 'Joyce', 'Van', 'Patten', 'lonely', 'bitter', 'woman', 'who', 'only', 'pleasure', 'life', 'hanging', 'police', 'who', 'mistakenly', 'allow', 'secretly', 'enjoying', 'seeing', 'other', 'peoples', 'tragedies', 'episode', 'James', 'Garner', 'favorite', 'one', 'where', 'jailed', 'contempt', 'court', 'showing', 'abuses', 'District', 'Attorney', 'powers', 'compel', 'people', 'testify', 'defiance', 'concience', 'was', 'also', 'season', 'Rockford', 'biggest', 'police', 'nemesis', 'Lt', 'Chapman', 'introduced.If', 'someone', 'good', 'introduction', 'series', 'would', 'recommend', 'first', 'DVD', 'set', 'purchase']",The Rockford Files: Season Three

There are a total of 22 episodes plus an episode from season four that's the bonus material. Jim Rockford is on the prowl, doing cases. And like before, sometimes he gets paid, sometimes he doesn't &, occasionally, he does a case for nothing. Stuart Margolin as Angel is more prominent as is Gretchen Corbett as Beth Davenport. The romantic angle between Rockford & Davenport is completely gone though you can tell they like one another. Joe Santos as Sgt. Dennis Becker has a more prominent role in this season, we even see his wife in a couple of episodes.Major guest stars abound in this season; Sharon Gless (Cagney & Lacey), Cleavon Little (Blazing Saddles), Isaac Hayes (recording artist most notably known for ""Shaft""), Lou Gossett, Jr. (who had co-starred with Garner in 1971's Skin Game), Ned Beatty, Strother Martin & Robert Loggia.Season three is where Garner finally won the Emmy for Best Actor in a Dramatic Series. Garner deserved the award & should've won it more times than he did. He's such an excellent actor that most of us don't realize that's what he's doing.There isn't an episode here that isn't entertaining. Sure, some are better than others but not any you want to miss.

In fact, I personally loved this season for the introduction of Lt Chapman alone.

1041263,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B000LXGXY8,Taheen Lopez,"[6, 6]","Rockford's 1976-77 Season is awesome and is even better and more upgraded than Rockford's first 2 seasons and probably the best season of them all throughout the ROCKFORD FILES whole 6-year run on NBC since the action on this detective drama seemed to have gotten better and more sophisticated as the seasons progressed with more car chases, more brawling scenes, more homicide cases, more mischief with the down-on-his-luck private-eye Jim Rockford(James Garner) sleazy persuasive ex-con buddy Angel Martin(Stu Margolin), more dilemma for Rockford's often flustered cop buddy Det. Dennis Becker(Joe Santos) from the LAPD, etc. along with the fact that this private detective show was still in its honeymoon phase doing well in the ratings.In addition to that, this was also the season when James Luisi joins the cast & crew of the show as Becker's hard-nosed superior officer(Lt. Doug Chapman) a.k.a. ""Chappy"" along with the fact that Rockford's Third Season had more episodes with my favorite character which was Rockford's drop-dead gorgeous attorney girlfriend Beth Davenport(Gretchen Corbett) than any other season, plus this seemed to be the season when Beth was at the peak of her appearance and career on this show along with the fact that Beth even helped out Angel in the ""Drought At Indianhead River"" episode, but what I don't understand is why didn't Beth come out in ""The Becker Connection"" episode when Dennis got suspended by his superiors for a false accusation since Beth would've really came in handy and helped Becker out a lot since Becker could've really used an attorney in that episode like his superiors suggested and Beth would've tried to make Chappy along with the rest of Becker's superiors to at least consider the possibility that Becker was innocent all along.Unfortunately Gretchen Corbett(Beth)was abruptly dropped from the show in the middle of Rockford's 4th Season back in the Winter of 1978, due to a salary dispute with Universal leaving us to mourn the loss of Beth in the last 2 1/2 seasons of this detective drama.Rockford's 3rd Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when I used to watch the ROCKFORD FILES every Friday night on NBC, plus I used to think it was so cool how Rockford would always cruise around from place to place around the whole L.A. Area in his bronze Pontiac Firebird to get around and how Rockford often wore snazzy 3-piece suits and lived an eccentric lifestyle since Rockford lived in a small ragged trailer in a parking lot in beautiful Malibu by the beach over by the famous Pacific Coast Highway near the famous Malibu Pier, yet Rockford's Firebird was often racked up, Rockford was often beat up by hoodlums, often shot at and was often in trouble with Becker's often skeptical superior officers Lt. Diehl(Tom Atkins)and Lt. Chapman(James Luisi)who detested Rockford and did whatever they could to get Rockford busted and use any excuse imaginable to get his P.I. license cancelled which frequently got Becker in a lot of hot water with Diehl and Chapman as well, yet I find it kind of odd why Diehl didn't appear even once in this season, but had came out in the 1st, 2nd, and 4th Seasons of the ROCKFORD FILES.It was also interesting seeing guest stars like*Gerald McRaney before he was even a star in the ""Rattlers' Class of '63"" episode before his co-starring days as the short-tempered gonzo PI(Rick Simon)on SIMON & SIMON & before his co-starring days on MAJOR DAD and TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL*Mary Carver in the ""Dirty Money, Black Light"" episode before her co-starring days as Rick & AJ Simons long suffering, but loving mother(Cecilia Simon) on SIMON & SIMON*William Daniels in the ""So Help Me God"" episode before his co-starring days of playing Dr. Mark Craig on ST. ELSEWHERE and being the voice of KITT on KNIGHT RIDER*Jon Cypher in the ""To Protect & To Serve"" episode before his days on MAJOR DAD and HILL STREET BLUES*Roger Mosley in the ""Dirty Money, Black Light"" episode before his co-starring days as Magnum's faithful old Navy buddy from the Vietnam war(T.C.)on MAGNUM, P.I.*Jim Sikking in ""The Becker Connection"" episode before his co-starring days as Lt. Howard Hunter on HILL STREET BLUES*Singer Isaac Hayes making a returning appearance as ex-con Gandy Fitch in the ""Another Polish Wedding"" episode*Sharon Gless in ""The Fourth Man"" episode before her co-starring days on the police drama CAGNEY & LACEY*Veronica Hamel in the ""Return Of The 38th Parallell"" episode before her co-starring days as the gorgeous attorney(Joyce Davenport) on HILL STREET BLUES*Lou Gossett, Jr. in the ""Another Polish Wedding"" episode before his co-starring days as Walt Shepherd on the short-lived series THE POWERS OF MATTHEW STAR*Richard Venture in ""The Trees, The Bees, & The T.T. Flowers"" episode before his co-starring days as the exasperated superior officer(Cmdr. Altobelli)on the short-lived STREET HAWK*Susan Howard in the ""Feeding Frenzy"" episode before her co-starring days on DALLASThis 1976-1977 Season was probably one of Rockford's best seasons since it was during the days way before the ROCKFORD FILES had to cancel all of the sudden back in January of 1980 due to James Garner's chronic back & knee problems and getting a slight dip in the Nielsen ratings thru much newer more popular shows like the DUKES OF HAZZARD, which obviously ended up K.O.ing Rockford when the Dukes made their debut on CBS in January of 1979, especially since the Dukes were in their honeymoon phase back then and Rockford no longer was.Rockford's 3rd Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane to the fact that I was 4 years old living in the Imperial Valley at the time in my boring hometown(El Centro, CA).The one thing I always found so intriguing about this private detective drama was the often festidious Jim Rockford(James Garner) was not only a bachelor, a Vietnam Veteran, and a pardoned ex-con now turned private investigator who lived on a shoe-string budget like Mannix(Mike Connors), Magnum(Tom Selleck), and Rick & AJ Simon(Gerald McRaney, Jameson Parker)did, but Rockford still seemed to have talent just like the Simon brothers did which often helped Rockford, Rick, and A.J. solve their cases along with the fact that the often fastidious Rockford had Becker from the LAPD to rely on just like the Simon brothers had their streetwise cop buddies Det. Marcel ""Downtown"" Brown(Tim Reid)and then Lt. Abigail Marsh(Joan McMurtry)from San Diego P.D. on SIMON & SIMON.In addition to that, Rockford always managed to always have spiffy clothes, snazzy 3-piece suits, his fancy bronze Firebird and still manage to afford living in Malibu, despite the fact that Rockford was often snookered by his clients, never had a lovely home, never had much money, never had a steady private-eye business, never had an office of his own, had his answering machine at his trailer taking calls from potential clients instead of a leggy secretary answering the phone at an office & was never rolling in bucks either since Rockford was just barely making ends meet struggling to make a living just like Mannix, Magnum, and Rick and AJ Simon all did, plus Rockford's lifestyle was a little eccentric just like Rick and AJ's was since Rockford always left his gun in a cookie-jar and lived in a rusty trailer in a parking lot by Malibu Beach just like Rick lived on a boat in the backyard of his baby brother AJ's house.It was also great being able to watch all these episodes of Rockford complete & uncut just like they were originally shown on their original air-dates on NBC, not like they were shown with lots of deleted scenes with too many commercial interruptions like when they were shown in reruns on ME-TV, WGN, TV Land, TNN, and A&E.;So now that Universal has just about all 6 seasons of the ROCKFORD FILES released on DVD and all 8 seasons of MAGNUM, P.I. released on DVD and SIMON & SIMON's first 2 seasons are out on DVD and since Paramount has MANNIX's first 2 seasons out on DVD, I'm hoping this has inspired Warner Bros. to release MATT HOUSTON with Lee Horseley & Pamela Hensley out on DVD soon, starting with MATT HOUSTON's 1st Season, since MATT HOUSTON was also a popular private detective show too just like the ROCKFORD FILES, MAGNUM, MANNIX, and SIMON & SIMON all were.Fortunately I just got word that Paramount will finally be releasing the detective drama MATT HOUSTON-Season 1 out on DVD on Tuesday March 9th, 2010 and that Shout will be releasing SIMON & SIMON-Season 4 out on DVD on Tuesday April 6th, 2010 and are now both available for pre-order which gives us 2 private detective dramas underway to look forward to for the Spring of 2010.",5,My Favorite Season!,1227139200,"11 20, 2008",2008,8644,"['Rockford', '1976-77', 'Season', 'awesome', 'even', 'better', 'more', 'upgraded',

This is, of course, due to solid writing and acting, but also the fleshing out of many of the regular characters, including Angel, Beth and Dennis.  It goes without saying that James Garners breezy characterization of Rockford rates as one of the best in TV history.

The Season Three release, like Season Two, contains single-sided disks--the dreaded Universal double-sided disks are gone, and with them, hopefully, the freezing and skipping problems that so many people reported with the Season One set.

1041267,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000LXGXY8,trebe,"[1, 1]","If you are a fan of The Rockford Files, there is a lot to like about season three (1976-77), as life seems to have settled down a bit, for Malibu private investigator Jim Rockford (James Garner).  As usual, Jim finds himself involved in offbeat cases, meeting interesting people, engaging in some radical car chases, and occasionally running afoul of the law, or organized crime, but with the support of his father ""Rocky"" (Noah Beery Jr.), police detective Dennis Becker (Joe Santos), and some of his close friends, ""Jimbo"" somehow manages to pull through.  There may not be many big paydays for Rockford, but in this season, at least he doesn't take it on the chin that often.Very little is happening in the romance department, as things have cooled down with lawyer Beth Davenport (Gretchen Corbett), and there are few damsel in distress type cases.  Fortunately, Beth is still around, when Jim gets into legal scrapes.  Stuart Margolin is always enjoyable as Jim's squirrely buddy ""Angel"" Martin, who this time around actually does more good than harm.  Adding some new flavors, Season Three features the introduction of James Luisi, as police Lt. Doug Chapman, who has a severe dislike for Rockford, and his methods.As in previous seasons, the writing remains at a high level, with more quirky adventures, and some great guest stars.  Robert Webber makes his third appearance on the program, as an infuriating psychic, looking to exploit Rockford, in ""The Oracle Wore a Cashmere Suit"".  Ned Beatty is very convincing, playing Jim's down on his luck Korean War army pal, in ""Return To The 38th Parallel"".The nature of the grand jury system is explored in ""So Help Me God"", where Jim crosses paths with an aggressive prosecutor.  The confidence game, a Rockford Files specialty, is brilliantly played in ""There's One In Every Port"".  Defending a football player charged with murder, Beth needs Jim's help badly, in ""Crack Back"".  Old friends Gandolph Fitch (Isaac Hayes) and Marcus Hayes (Louis Gossett Jr.), return in ""Just Another Polish Wedding"".  A scene where the two men confront a group of white supremacists, is priceless.This season also features a pair of outstanding and suspenseful two part adventures.  ""The Trees, the Bees, and T.T. Flowers"", features Strother Martin as Rocky's friend, who is put into a sanitarium, so his property can be taken from him.  In ""To Protect and Serve"", Joyce Van Patten gives a terrific performance, as a police ""buff"" who interferes with an investigation.  In addition, George Loros makes his first appearance, as hitman Anthony Gagglio.With a nice variety of stories, Season Three features more of the quirky escapades that fans had come to love, with just a smidge more reality and sophistication.  For his work during this season, James Garner (The Great Escape (1963),Grand Prix (1966),Maverick (1957-62)) would win an Emmy for his portrayal of Jim Rockford, who just becomes more enjoyable to watch, when he is well supported by his close friends.",5,"more intriguing adventures in the life james rockford, result in an Emmy for james garner...",1368921600,"05 19, 2013",2013,3001,"['are', 'fan', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'lot', 'like', 'season', 'three', '1976-77', 'life', 'have', 'settled', 'down', 'bit', 'Malibu', 'private', 'investigator', 'Jim', 'Rockford', 'James', 'Garner', 'usual', 'Jim', 'involved', 'offbeat', 'cases', 'meeting', 'interesting', 'people', 'engaging', 'radical', 'car', 'chases', 'occasionally', 'running', 'afoul', 'law', 'organized', 'crime', 'support', 'father', 'Rocky', 'Noah', 'Beery', 'Jr.', 'police', 'detective', 'Dennis', 'Becker', 'Joe', 'Santos', 'close', 'friends', 'Jimbo', 'somehow', 'pull', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'many', 'big', 'paydays', 'Rockford', 'season', 'least', ""n't"", 'take', 'chin', 'often.Very', 'little', 'happening', 'romance', 'department', 'things', 'have', 'cooled', 'down', 'lawyer', 'Beth', 'Davenport', 'Gretchen', 'Corbett', 'are', 'few', 'damsel', 'distress', 'type', 'cases', 'Fortunately', 'Beth', 'still', 'around', 'when', 'Jim', 'legal', 'scrapes', 'Stuart', 'Margolin', 'always', 'enjoyable', 'Jim', 'squirrely', 'buddy', 'Angel', 'Martin', 'who', 'time', 'around', 'actually', 'more', 'good', 'harm', 'Adding', 'new', 'flavors', 'Season', 'Three', 'introduction', 'James', 'Luisi', 'police', 'Lt.', 'Doug', 'Chapman', 'who', 'severe', 'dislike', 'Rockford', 'methods.As', 'previous', 'seasons', 'writing', 'high', 'level', 'more', 'quirky', 'adventures', 'great', 'guest', 'stars', 'Robert', 'Webber', 'third', 'appearance', 'program', 'infuriating', 'psychic', 'looking', 'exploit', 'Rockford', 'Oracle', 'Wore', 'Cashmere', 'Suit', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'very', 'convincing', 'playing', 'Jim', 'down', 'luck', 'Korean', 'War', 'army', 'pal', 'Return', '38th', 'Parallel', '.The', 'nature', 'grand', 'jury', 'system', 'explored', 'So', 'Help', 'Me', 'God', 'where', 'Jim', 'paths', 'aggressive', 'prosecutor', 'confidence', 'game', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'specialty', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'One', 'Port', 'Defending', 'football', 'player', 'charged', 'murder', 'Beth', 'Jim', 'help', 'badly', 'Crack', 'Back', 'Old', 'Gandolph', 'Fitch', 'Isaac', 'Hayes', 'Marcus', 'Hayes', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr.', 'return', 'Just', 'Polish', 'Wedding', 'scene', 'where', 'two', 'men', 'confront', 'group', 'white', 'supremacists', 'priceless.This', 'season', 'also', 'pair', 'outstanding', 'suspenseful', 'two', 'part', 'adventures', 'Trees', 'Bees', 'T.T', 'Flowers', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'Rocky', 'friend', 'who', 'put', 'sanitarium', 'property', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'Protect', 'Serve', 'Joyce', 'Van', 'Patten', 'terrific', 'performance', 'police', 'buff', 'who', 'investigation', 'addition', 'George', 'Loros', 'first', 'appearance', 'hitman', 'Anthony', 'Gagglio.With', 'nice', 'variety', 'stories', 'Season', 'Three', 'more', 'quirky', 'escapades', 'fans', 'had', 'come', 'love', 'just', 'smidge', 'more', 'reality', 'sophistication', 'work', 'season', 'James', 'Garner', 'Great', 'Escape', '1963', 'Grand', 'Prix', '1966', 'Maverick', '1957-62', 'would', 'win', 'Emmy', 'portrayal', 'Jim', 'Rockford', 'who', 'just', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'when', 'well', 'supported', 'close', 'friends']",The Rockford Files: Season Three

The third season finds Jim in the driver's seat driving the stories and the ratings improved allowing the show to continue on for a nice long run. Featuring a parade of great guest stars including Sharon Gless, character actor Robert Walden as a psychic working on a case Jim had  and top notch writing by Juanita Bartlett and David Chase (who would go on the create ""The Sorpranos""), the third season looks extremely good with minimal dirt, debris and the uncut episodes. As usual the terrific supporting including Joe Santos, the lovely Gretchen Corbett, Stuart Margolin and Noah Berry Jr. provide color and humor.The only extra we get here is ""Quickie Nirvana"" an episode from the fourth season (written by David Chase) and while I don't mind having a preview of succeeding great seasons (and ""Quickie Nirvana"" is an extremely good episode), I'd rather see Universal include some interviews with some of the cast including Gretchen Corbett as Beth(am I the only kid who was in love with her when she was on the show?
