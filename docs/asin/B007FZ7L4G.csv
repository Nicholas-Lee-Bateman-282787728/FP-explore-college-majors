You don't walk into a Black family's house without knocking and door answered.3. Decent Blacks don't allow their daughter to go out anytime she wants with aman much older than her..come in 7 a.m. in the morning and Daddy say nothing.Not a Black father. She was a teen...he was in very late 20s, early 30s.4. Did not check out the boyfriend who was a 'dope pusher'and he had son anddaughter in his pocket, ruining their lives.5. They are broke with no money; Daddy don't listen to his kids, or son who istelling him he can win a million dollars on the radio.6. Son puts their name in anyway and they call; daddy acting crazy on phone withcontest people, and son had to grab the phone and holler out the answer to thecontest and they win a million.  Then Daddy says,he won the money, Its hismoney.  What? They son won that money.7. Daddy now controls all the money, gives silly daughter a $100,000 credit card, ateen; he did not give son a card. They blow all the money, did not pay taxes, gobroke. Wife buys 20 pair of 1,000 shoes; 30 purses @ $5,000 each, etc.8. His brother who he did not want to come to his house, or let him stay a few days,came to save them but Daddy with his mean attitude, everybody wrong but him, wolfsthe whole time. Don't want to listen to anyone.9. Boyfriend comes to kill son, etc; uncle saves him, daddy want to throw uncle out.Uncle is the one with the life raft for them all. Millionairs they were. They didnot deserve anything from their behavior. Mean spirits winning.  No good.This is the worse I have ever seen David E. Talbert write. Really bad play, and he said his funniest.

1530525,A22RZG1NQ0WAUX,B007FZ7L4G,Katrina L. Burchett,"[8, 10]","Husband (Michael Beach) and wife (Cindy Herron-Braggs, formerly of En Vogue) both work hard to provide for their family, yet they struggle to pay the bills. And the stress becomes worse when Mr. Jordan loses his job. But then there's a call from a radio station, and the Jordan family's financial situation is changed.I saw the name Michael Beach (Third Watch, First Sunday, Ruby Bridges, Soul Food, ER) and decided to watch this play. I didn't realize Mishon Ratliff (R&B; singer, dancer, actor) was cast as the teenage son; when he came onto the stage, I became even more interested. I remember Mishon from Lincoln Heights, a show that aired on ABC Family and, in my opinion, shouldn't have been cancelled. He is a talented young man and his presence is what made this play so entertaining for me.After what Mrs. Jordan said to her husband because she was tired of having so little (I felt for Mr. Jordan at that moment), I thought she'd be more responsible when the money came. Actually, I thought they'd all have better sense than to make so many bad choices, and I kept wondering how they could be so wasteful, but the play is called `A Fool and His Money' - Jesus warned us to beware of selfishness and greed (Luke 12:15). Barely scraping by had affected Mr. and Mrs. Jordan's marriage and their son's education, but I guess they forgot all about that when dollars signs were all they could see. They needed to change their mindsets, and then they would have dealt with the million dollars wisely.David E. Talbert shows how family members can allow money to tear them apart. He also shows how you never know who you're going to need: The family didn't like it when a long lost uncle (Eddie Griffin) showed up unexpectedly, but it turned out they were blessed to have him there. And he shows how some females will settle for less than they want in a man. There is also an important message of forgiveness in this well-acted stage play.A Fool and His Money is a musical comedy-drama. I liked the singing, the humor (my favorite part is when Mr. Jordan had his son get out the Bible), and the ending.*Do not copy/paste my review without permission.
