417072,A7Y6AVS576M03,6304368534,gobirds2,"[15, 15]","""The Monkey's Uncle"" is an entertaining and funny sequel to ""The Misadventures of Merlin Jones."" Set again at Midvale College, it is better than the first. This time Merlin Jones the student genius, played again by Walt Disney's stalwart Tommy Kirk, gets involved with sleep experiments with his pet chimpanzee and a bicycle-propelled flying machine. Jones's girlfriend again played by Annette Funicello still vies romantically for his attentions, as he still remains fixated with his goofy scientific experiments. Leon Ames returns as Judge Hornsby. One great highlight of this film is the title song ""The Monkey's Uncle"" written from the genius of Walt Disney's reliable Sherman Brothers. It is performed by The Beach Boys and Annette Funicello on screen behind the credits. This film and its predecessor seem like such minor efforts but they were the two films that attracted my daughter's attention and got her interested for more of Walt Disney's live action films. I wish they would put a lot of these old Walt Disney movies back in print because my daughter and a bunch of her friends really liked them. At that time I went out on quest and bought up every Walt Disney live action film I could get my hands on. I love these films and I still watch them. When I say that I recommend something from Disney I mean it.",5,Merlin Jones Returns thanks to Walt Disney,972604800,"10 27, 2000",2000,1321,"['Monkey', 'Uncle', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'sequel', 'Misadventures', 'Merlin', 'Jones', 'Set', 'again', 'Midvale', 'College', 'better', 'first', 'time', 'Merlin', 'Jones', 'student', 'genius', 'played', 'again', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'stalwart', 'Tommy', 'Kirk', 'involved', 'sleep', 'experiments', 'pet', 'chimpanzee', 'bicycle-propelled', 'flying', 'machine', 'Jones', 'girlfriend', 'again', 'played', 'Annette', 'Funicello', 'still', 'romantically', 'attentions', 'still', 'fixated', 'goofy', 'scientific', 'experiments', 'Leon', 'Ames', 'returns', 'Judge', 'Hornsby', 'One', 'great', 'highlight', 'film', 'title', 'song', 'Monkey', 'Uncle', 'written', 'genius', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'reliable', 'Sherman', 'Brothers', 'performed', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'Annette', 'Funicello', 'screen', 'credits', 'film', 'predecessor', 'seem', 'such', 'minor', 'efforts', 'were', 'two', 'films', 'attracted', 'daughter', 'attention', 'got', 'interested', 'more', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'live', 'action', 'films', 'wish', 'would', 'put', 'lot', 'old', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'movies', 'back', 'print', 'daughter', 'bunch', 'friends', 'really', 'liked', 'time', 'went', 'out', 'quest', 'bought', 'up', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'could', 'get', 'hands', 'love', 'films', 'still', 'watch', 'When', 'say', 'recommend', 'something', 'Disney', 'mean']",Monkey's Uncle VHS
