I wish they kept it going to tell the stories of those serving now in this time of war, as they were doing when the series came to a close. I never missed an eppisode in it's entire run on NBC and CBS.Having said this, I disagree with all most all of the other reviews here. The first season on NBC started out bad and just got awful. I was ready to quit the series myself when NBC dropped it.Tracey Needham's role was awful. I really got mad in the episode when they traveled to an American Embassy in a factious Latin American country with hostile rebels. She didn't like the way the U.S. Marine Gunny was training his marines, so she interfered just because she was an officer. No self respecting Gunny, would allow any officer not in his chain of command, who didn't know his mission, interfer with his training.There were two other especially bad episodes, but there's not point in going on. The whole first season is a waste of your valuable time, trust me. The show was saved and improved when it went to CBS. They knew how to do it right.You would be better off waiting till Season 2 and the rest come out, if you want to see the show you loved like me.

Well from episode one thru to episode 10 so far of this season (SEASON ONE) the word ZULU is NOT....again NOT posted after the numerals.  Now then I am noting a concern and that is between episode 9 and episode 10.  In episode 9 Rabb is wearing gold oak leaves and from episodes 1 thru 8 here was wearing rail road tracks.  Then back in episode 10 guess what reappears....the RAIL ROAD TRACKS......he goes from LT to LT Commander to LT again.....that is an ERROR.  There are most likely more errors that I could seek out; but I was not seeking them out and the error I noted was just a little to OUT THERE.  Even with that error I still like watching he series.  There is enough action in the series to hold your attention and there is also many bits of laughter that you can see from episode to episode.  Plus there is a sense of humanism that you can sense from the main characters.

986054,AJDOJANK50QJV,B000F9T70A,D. McSherry,"[3, 4]","I brought the first season of JAG , and watched the Pilot Episode for the first time. The first season helped me ""catch up"" on RADM Chegwidden, the CAG, and then-LTJG Kaitlin Pike.  There's some background on how then-Lt. Rabb came to JAG. I knew Rabb made LCDR during the first season, but the script never explained if he was ""cured"" of night blindness (although he got his wings back guiding the CAG home safe), and how he secured permission to apply and attend law school after he was grounded.I didn't start watching JAG until it appeared on the USA network circa 2001.  One thing I liked is it was a ""clean show"", with not alot of sex, violence, drug use, terrible jokes, gay people, like some of today's TV shows.  I thought the main characters were good people who believed in what they were doing, and did it well.  For the most part, Harm, Mac, A.J., Bud, Sturgis, were positive influences on Television.  I thank Bellisario for writing a quality show, and maybe others in Hollywood will take note.  Today, the only shows I watch regularly (other than JAG re-runs) are ""Cold Case"" and ""CSI: NY"". I've seen ""NCIS"", but it hasn't held my interest level very much.While I'm glad I purchased the first season on DVD, my favorite seasons of JAG are the later ones (4th through 8th), where the characters were more developed. While I liked LCDR Rabb (later CDR), I felt LT. Roberts and CDR Turner were more believable to the US Navy.  I enjoyed watching LT Bud Roberts develop, especially with his beloved wife LTJG Sims, and I liked CDR Sturgis Turner (I wanted him to make CAPT before Rabb, but that didn't happen).  I also liked Gunnery SGT Victor Galindez, and Petty Officer Tiner.  I would of enjoyed having RADM Chegwidden for a ""boss"", and I felt he had a good grasp of a Navy Officer, as did LT Roberts and CDR Turner.  I'm sorry that John M. Jackson was never nominated for an Emmy Award.I liked how Bellisario would invite people back, and the story lines would continue with those from a previous episodes.  Bellisario has a ""loyal"" following with several JAG actors (such as W.K. Stratton, Larry Manetti, and Jeff MacKay from Black Sheep Squadron), and he frequently had judges who would make recurring appearances, such as Corbin Bernsen and Jennifer Savidge.  Few people remember Savidge on St. Elsewhere, and Bernsen is probably the only actor from LA Law (besides Alan Rachins), who has been able to get another series.  Watching reruns, I found that Sean Murray from NCIS played Danny Walden, and LCDR Roberts was an ensign in the pilot episode. Bellisario brought Patrict Laborteaux back to the show when CBS picked it up after NBC cancelled it. Few people remember Laborteaux as a child star on Little House on the Prairie where he and his brother Matthew had recurring parts as friends of Laura Ingalls.As for the female leads, I need to go back and see the episodes that had Jordan Parker's character in them (I missed those), and I liked Catherine Bell (she's very smart and pretty-I'm not dead), although Karri Turner's character of Harriet Sims was a little more believable. I hope Zoe McLellan gets some more acting roles, and I did like her part as Petty Officer Jennifer Coates. Few people know that the actress who played LT Singer (Nanci Chambers) is David James Elliot's real-life wife (they have been married for 14 years and have 2 or 3 children), and Andrea Parker was supposed to be the female lead in the first season, but NBC execs didn't want her in the role. However, Ms. Parker did get a good part in the Pretender, and had a sitcom on ABC.  She returned to JAG sometimes, as did Randy Vasquez, who got a part on Bellisario's First Monday.Another thing I liked about Bellisario was he seemed to cast good female leads for Adm. Chegwidden.  Hollywood often thinks women over 35 are not ""beautiful.""  I thank Bellisario for casting Cynthia Sikes as Dr. Walden (who I had a crush on in high school when she was on St. Elsewhere), and later casting Isabell Hoffman (remember Dear John?).  Both of them, especially Cynthia Sikes, fit in well with John M. Jackson.  I remember Sikes leaving St. Elsewhere because the writers were going to make her character into a lesbian, and that should be a tribute to the values Ms. Sikes holds.If I would skip any season of JAG, it would be the 9th season - I didn't really get into all the story lines with Webb and the traveling around the globe, especially when Webb was dating Lt. Col. McKenzie (Mac). I also preferred Paul Collins as the SECNAV over Dean Stockwell, even though Stockwell was on Bellisario's Quantum Leap.  I think JAG should of ""wrapped up"" earlier, especially since some of the characters were leaving. Even though I enjoyed Adm. Chegwidden's last official duty promoting LT Roberts to LCDR, and liked David Andrews portrayal of MGEN Criswell, JAG probably should of quit around the 8th season.Hollywood, JAG was a quality TV show, and take a note from Donald Bellisario that a ""clean show"" will be watched by many.",4,Hollywood - Take Notes from Bellisario,1164412800,"11 25, 2006",2006,5014,"['brought', 'first', 'season',

It was the only season I watched with regularity and was surprised as I watched the series again that there were certain moments that brought about a sense of deja vu.Lieutentant j.g. Meg Austin was and remains my favorite partner for Harm because she was, first and foremost a Navy officer and a JAG lawyer. Theirs was a very natural chemistry even before they got past the formalities of ""Lieutentant"" and ""Sir"" and it became clear early on that Meg was falling for her senior partner.It took Harm a little longer to begin to see Meg differently and that transformation seemed to take place after ""Hemlock"", when she was left in a coma from an assassins bullet.She also didn't hesitate to put herself in certain situations when she deemed it necessary in the course of an investigation. She posed as a Marine recruit in ""Boot"" to find out why another young recruit was found hanged. She went out into the field in ""High Ground"" when a Gunnery Sergeant escaped from the Brig and Harm went after him to bring him back in.It wasn't until ""The Prisoner"" after Harm was imprisoned by the Chinese, that Meg finally voiced her feelings for her partner.The monkey wrench in this whole thing was Commander Allison Krenick. From the first time she laid eyes on Lieutenant Rabb, the Commander made no bones about that fact that she wanted him.She was the complete opposite of Meg, who chose to keep her feelings to herself. Krenick on the other hand, tried to devise any manner of situations that would get her alone with Harm, but was always thwarted.When Meg would find herself alone with him, usually in some manner of undress it was the result of a situation they hadn't planned on.I must admit that I never understood the whole Mac and Harm phenomenon and never thought that they had much chemistry together. That was one of the reasons that I didn't watch JAG very regularly beyond the first episode of the second season.Without Meg Austin, JAG just wasn't as good.",4,Season One and that's it for me,1175040000,"03 28, 2007",2007,2041,"['was', 'so', 'glad', 'see', 'first', 'season', 'JAG', 'was', 'finally', 'released', 'DVD', 'was', 'only', 'season', 'watched', 'regularity', 'was', 'surprised', 'watched', 'series', 'again', 'were', 'certain', 'moments', 'brought', 'about', 'sense', 'deja', 'vu.Lieutentant', 'j.g', 'Meg', 'Austin', 'was', 'favorite', 'partner', 'Harm', 'was', 'first', 'foremost', 'Navy', 'officer', 'JAG', 'lawyer', 'Theirs', 'was', 'very', 'natural', 'chemistry', 'even', 'got', 'formalities', 'Lieutentant', 'Sir', 'became', 'clear', 'early', 'Meg', 'was', 'falling', 'senior', 'partner.It', 'took', 'Harm', 'little', 'longer', 'begin', 'see', 'Meg', 'differently', 'transformation', 'seemed', 'take', 'place', 'Hemlock', 'when', 'was', 'left', 'coma', 'assassins', 'bullet.She', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'put', 'certain', 'situations', 'when', 'deemed', 'necessary', 'course', 'investigation', 'posed', 'Marine', 'recruit', 'Boot', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'young', 'recruit', 'was', 'found', 'hanged', 'went', 'out', 'field', 'High', 'Ground', 'when', 'Gunnery', 'Sergeant', 'escaped', 'Brig', 'Harm', 'went', 'bring', 'back', 'in.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'Prisoner', 'Harm', 'was', 'imprisoned', 'Chinese', 'Meg', 'finally', 'voiced', 'feelings', 'partner.The', 'monkey', 'wrench', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'Commander', 'Allison', 'Krenick', 'first', 'time', 'laid', 'eyes', 'Lieutenant', 'Rabb', 'Commander', 'made', 'bones', 'fact', 'wanted', 'him.She', 'was', 'complete', 'opposite', 'Meg', 'who', 'chose', 'keep', 'feelings', 'herself', 'Krenick', 'other', 'hand', 'tried', 'devise', 'manner', 'situations', 'would', 'get', 'alone', 'Harm', 'was', 'always', 'thwarted.When', 'Meg', 'would', 'find', 'alone', 'usually', 'manner', 'undress', 'was', 'result', 'situation', 'had', ""n't"", 'planned', 'on.I', 'must', 'admit', 'never', 'understood', 'whole', 'Mac', 'Harm', 'phenomenon', 'never', 'thought', 'had', 'much', 'chemistry', 'together', 'was', 'one', 'reasons', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'JAG', 'very', 'regularly', 'first', 'episode', 'second', 'season.Without', 'Meg', 'Austin', 'JAG', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good']",N/A

The first season debuted with a two hour pilot that was as totally captivating and had the production values of a major motion picture. JAG was always clever at including cameos by newsworthy figures including Oliver North and even the President of United States. The acting and writing were always first rate on this show.

986135,A33RNFP0YTN5AS,B000F9T70A,Misty Parsons,"[0, 0]","The first season was a good one.  Typical, but good.  It didn't get better until the 2nd season, when they made Catherine Bell a part of the show and brought Patrick Labyorteaux in as well, full time.But for the first season, it started as - in my opinion - wanting to be a Top Gun influenced show (for the lead character anyway) with a bit of an Officer and a Gentleman thrown in and some A Few Good Men thrown in for good measure.  It didn't quite get up to those standards, until the second season.  It aspired to it, and you could tell that if you hang with it, it would be a great show, but it took a while for the writing, the acting, and the characters to gel into a show that you WANTED to watch - didn't just watch because it happened to be on.And that is what I believe the first season truly was.  A show that had a few great episodes, but more often than not, was a show that you would watch if it was on, but you didn't plan your night around.I am glad they stopped using the original lead female character (Caitlin Pike) as such after the first episode(s).  Meg Austin became a better female lead character, but I'm glad they stopped having her as the female lead after the first season, too.  They hit the mark on the female lead with Mac.And the friendships developed with Bud Roberts were awesome as well - and lent a great atmosphere to Season 2 and beyond.My favorites of Season 1?A NEW LIFE Part 1 and 2 - First episode - as with most series - it has to be included - because that's where you get the &#34;feel&#34; of the character - or what the character is originally MEANT to be anyway.  And this is true here as well.  Was it a great episode? No. It was a good episode with several notes throughout that were great.  Harm's reactions to the way the crew viewed his father - great.  Harm's interaction with the newscaster - perfect.  LOVED that connection.  His interaction with the skipper and the CAG - good, but turned great by the end.  The last scene with the CAG when he was recuperating was what made me want to keep watching the show - knowing that given time, David James Elliott would bring Harm (his character) into one that I really wanted to see mature.Desert Son - Ollie's in the episode - what's not to like? LOL.  No, it really is a good episode.  The living son of a former commandant is accused of screwing up and killing soldiers.  He says he did it, but Harm is mistrustful because the man has never taken responsibility for anything in his life.  When the tape of the coordinates being given for the bombing goes missing, Harm is extremely mistrustful.  When it shows back up, more so.  Meg proves herself as a valuable asset in this one.  Great episode.  All the actors did well, except Ollie - his acting was so bad it was funny LOL.Pilot Error - awesome.  Love this episode - you get to see Harm's protection of his friends and defense of his friends' character.Smoked, Black Ops, and Ares - great episodes.  A lot of action and great acting by all involved.Skeleton Crew - what's not to like?  You get to meet NCIS (Gibbs).  Parts of this were later used in another season's episodes since it wasn't actually allowed to be aired in it's original entirety.  But great episode nonetheless.  And Bud Roberts comes back :)All in all - greatest season ever?  Absolutely not.  Worth seeing - ABSOLUTELY.  It gives you some insights into later developments of all the characters.  Even in Mac's - though you never see her - if you combine the original two female lead's best characteristics and add a third layer of female lead - you get Mac.  But I don't believe this is one you will sit and watch one right after the other like later seasons.  You'll need to throw in another show / series and then go back to this first season.  It was good, but not great, but definitely worth watching.",3,Good first season,1398556800,"04 27, 2014",2014,3832,"['first', 'season', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'Typical', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', '2nd', 'season', 'when', 'made', 'Catherine', 'Bell', 'part', 'show', 'brought', 'Patrick', 'Labyorteaux', 'as', 'well', 'full', 'time.But', 'first', 'season', 'started', 'opinion', 'wanting', 'be', 'Top', 'Gun', 'influenced', 'show', 'lead', 'character', 'anyway', 'bit', 'Officer', 'Gentleman', 'thrown', 'A', 'Few', 'Good', 'Men', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'up', 'standards', 'second', 'season', 'aspired', 'could', 'tell', 'hang', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'show', 'took', 'while', 'writing', 'acting', 'characters', 'gel', 'show', 'WANTED', 'watch', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'watch', 'happened', 'be', 'on.And', 'what', 'believe', 'first', 'season', 'truly', 'was', 'show', 'had', 'few', 'great', 'episodes', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'was', 'show', 'would', 'watch', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'plan', 'night', 'around.I', 'am', 'glad', 'stopped', 'using', 'original', 'lead', 'female', 'character', 'Caitlin', 'Pike', 'such', 'first', 'episode', 's', 'Meg', 'Austin', 'became', 'better', 'female', 'lead', 'character', ""'m"", 'glad', 'stopped', 'having', 'female', 'lead', 'first', 'season', 'too', 'hit', 'mark', 'female', 'lead', 'Mac.And', 'friendships', 'developed', 'Bud', 'Roberts', 'were', 'awesome', 'as', 'well', 'lent', 'great', 'atmosphere', 'Season', '2', 'beyond.My', 'favorites', 'Season', '1', 'NEW', 'LIFE', 'Part', '1', '2', 'First', 'episode', 'most', 'series', 'be', 'included', 'where', 'get', '34', 'feel', '34', 'character', 'what', 'character', 'originally', 'MEANT', 'be', 'anyway', 'true', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Was', 'great', 'episode', 'No', 'was', 'good', 'episode', 'several', 'notes', 'were', 'great', 'Harm', 'reactions', 'way', 'crew', 'viewed', 'father', 'great', 'Harm', 'interaction', 'newscaster', 'perfect', 'LOVED', 'connection', 'interaction', 'skipper', 'CAG', 'good', 'turned', 'great', 'end', 'last', 'scene', 'CAG', 'when', 'was', 'recuperating', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'want', 'keep', 'watching', 'show', 'knowing', 'given', 'time', 'David', 'James', 'Elliott', 'would', 'bring', 'Harm', 'character', 'one', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'mature.Desert', 'Son', 'Ollie', 'episode', 'what', 'not', 'like', 'LOL', 'No', 'really', 'good', 'episode', 'living', 'son', 'former', 'commandant', 'accused', 'screwing', 'up', 'killing', 'soldiers', 'did', 'Harm', 'mistrustful', 'man', 'never', 'taken', 'responsibility', 'anything', 'life', 'When', 'tape', 'coordinates', 'being', 'given', 'bombing', 'missing', 'Harm', 'extremely', 'mistrustful', 'When', 'back', 'up', 'more', 'so', 'Meg', 'valuable', 'asset', 'one', 'Great', 'episode', 'actors', 'did', 'well', 'Ollie', 'acting', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'was', 'funny', 'LOL.Pilot', 'Error', 'awesome', 'Love', 'episode', 'get', 'see', 'Harm', 'protection', 'friends', 'defense', 'friends', 'character.Smoked', 'Black', 'Ops', 'Ares', 'great', 'episodes', 'lot', 'action', 'great', 'acting', 'involved.Skeleton', 'Crew', 'what', 'not', 'like', 'get', 'meet', 'NCIS', 'Gibbs', 'Parts', 'were', 'later', 'used', 'season', 'episodes', 'was', ""n't"", 'actually', 'allowed', 'be', 'aired', 'original', 'entirety', 'great', 'episode', 'nonetheless', 'Bud', 'Roberts', 'back', 'greatest', 'season', 'ever', 'Absolutely', 'not', 'seeing', 'ABSOLUTELY', 'insights', 'later', 'developments', 'characters', 'Even', 'Mac', 'never', 'see', 'combine', 'original', 'two', 'female', 'lead', 'best', 'characteristics', 'add', 'third', 'layer', 'female', 'lead', 'get', 'Mac', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'one', 'will', 'sit', 'watch', 'one', 'right', 'other', 'later', 'seasons', ""'ll"", 'need', 'throw', 'show', '/', 'series', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

This really was a season of not knowing which way it wanted to go.  I thought there were some good episodes but for the most part this series didn't really pick up until the 2nd season when it was made more like a law and order show via the military.  Plus Catherine Bell was a huge edition to the show.  I know there is a lot of fan support for Andrea Parker and I liked her but she didn't come close to the chemistry that Bell had with Elliot.
