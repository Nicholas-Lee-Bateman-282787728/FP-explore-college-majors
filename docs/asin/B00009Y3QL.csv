759699,A2SE9F3RBSJQEH,B00009Y3QL,Thierry,"[7, 8]","When I saw the movie Platoon, I was really astonished. I could not believe that a film could actually capture what it was like for so many of us who were in the war there. But, the film was so authentic, that , at times, I felt like I was back there. Oliver Stone really did create a masterpiece. There Goes My Baby, in some ways, captures what it was like for high school students in the late 60's who were naive about the war, hurled into it by the policies of the government at the times, and did not know what they were getting into. So many of the stories in the film ring true for what it was like for me and my friends at that time ,and how, for so many of us, our lives changed courses drastically, because of the upcoming war. It was fun to see the actors in the film in some of their earliest acting. Actors that we recognize today after many films and roles.I really enjoyed the music alot in the film. I was a big Motown fan and liked the Motown and rock music throughout the film ,and the stories of the hopes and dreams that the actors had about their lives and loves, and how so many of them changed as a result of events beyond their control. A interesting film, better than the typical teenage fodder of so many films.",3,A formula with heart,1344556800,"08 10, 2012",2012,1235,"['When', 'saw', 'movie', 'Platoon', 'was', 'really', 'astonished', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'film', 'could', 'actually', 'capture', 'what', 'was', 'so', 'many', 'who', 'were', 'war', 'there', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'authentic', 'times', 'felt', 'was', 'back', 'there', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'really', 'did', 'create', 'masterpiece', 'Goes', 'My', 'Baby', 'ways', 'what', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'late', '60', 'who', 'were', 'naive', 'war', 'hurled', 'policies', 'government', 'times', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'were', 'getting', 'So', 'many', 'stories', 'film', 'ring', 'true', 'what', 'was', 'friends', 'time', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'lives', 'changed', 'courses', 'drastically', 'upcoming', 'war', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'actors', 'film', 'earliest', 'acting', 'Actors', 'recognize', 'today', 'many', 'films', 'roles.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'music', 'alot', 'film', 'was', 'big', 'Motown', 'fan', 'liked', 'Motown', 'rock', 'music', 'film', 'stories', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'actors', 'had', 'lives', 'loves', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'changed', 'result', 'events', 'control', 'interesting', 'film', 'better', 'typical', 'teenage', 'fodder', 'so', 'many', 'films']",N/A
