Its a shame that movies like this dont get the commercial support that other movies get, the world could be such a better place and more accepting of alternative ideas about Lifestlye and clothing style.  This movie did a fabulous job of depicting a little well known fact that most of our prejudices are simple remnants of emotional pains we experienced as children. Gary Sinise's feelings about his son were just old wounds that his mother had branded on him when he was child.  I wont say too much, I have already been grilled once for spoiling the story, so I will just say: Great Movie, very moving, very uplifting and there is a lesson to be learned.  HINT: Listen to the words the little boy is using at the beginning and end of the movie.  The other performaces were ok... this is where it got silly.  I dont know how serious Shirley Mclaine wanted the movie to be, but I did pick up alot of comedy, I hope I wasnt laughing when i was supposed to be sympathetic.",5,Silly and Sweet,1277769600,"06 29, 2010",2010,1151,"['only', 'recently', 'saw', 'movie', 'came', 'Movie', 'Channel', 'was', 'so', 'moved', 'performance', 'little', 'Alex', 'D.Linz', 'immediately', 'got', 'online', 'purchase', 'film', 'Amazon', 'shame', 'movies', 'dont', 'get', 'commercial', 'support', 'other', 'movies', 'get', 'world', 'could', 'be', 'such', 'better', 'place', 'more', 'accepting', 'alternative', 'ideas', 'Lifestlye', 'clothing', 'style', 'movie', 'did', 'fabulous', 'job', 'depicting', 'little', 'well', 'known', 'fact', 'most', 'prejudices', 'are', 'simple', 'remnants', 'emotional', 'pains', 'experienced', 'children', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'feelings', 'son', 'were', 'just', 'old', 'wounds', 'mother', 'had', 'branded', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'wont', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'grilled', 'once', 'spoiling', 'story', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'Great', 'Movie', 'very', 'moving', 'very', 'uplifting', 'lesson', 'be', 'learned', 'HINT', 'Listen', 'words', 'little', 'boy', 'using', 'beginning', 'end', 'movie', 'other', 'performaces', 'were', 'ok', 'where', 'got', 'silly', 'dont', 'know', 'how', 'serious', 'Shirley', 'Mclaine', 'wanted', 'movie', 'be', 'did', 'pick', 'up', 'alot', 'comedy', 'hope', 'wasnt', 'laughing', 'when', 'i', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'sympathetic']",N/A

This is the kind of movie the whole family can watch and should with its theme of not being afraid to be who or how you want to be. It is too bad this movie never made it to the theaters so more could see it. Also known by the title ""Bruno"" ""Dress Code"" is about a boy who wants to wear dresses. Why? Not for the reasons you might be thinking. Bruno doesn't wear dresses because he is a cross-dresser or because he is transgendered. He is neither of those. He wants to wear dresses because he sees them as garments of power. The reason he does is because all the great religious leaders from the Dali Lama to the Pope wear ""dresses"" during religious ceremonies. He wants to wear dresses therefore so he can have power too. Especially since he is going to be representing his school in a national spelling bee. The confrontations he has with the Mother Superior of the school, played wonderfully by Kathy Bates, over the issue makes for great comedic scenes. The rest of the cast is first rate including among them Shirley MacLaine. Shirley MacLaine pulls double duty here acting, playing the part of Brunos' Grandmother, and making her directing debute. And she is excellant in both. I think she shows that the directing talent in her family isn't limited to her famous brother Warren Beatty. I am not aware if she has done any directing since this movie but I hope so since she shows she has the gift to. The movie has a strong message to it and a feel good ending that isn't sappy or overboard in sweetness. But this movie will have you cheering for the boy wearing the power garment.

Children should be encouraged, or at least allowed, to express themselves in unconventional ways.  I agree with Robert Bly's observation that those parts of ourselves that we suppress by ""putting them in a bag"" will become more primitive and dangerous.  If we don't allow the boy to wear a dress when he's eight, he might grow up to become the ""Buffalo Bill"" character in ""Silence of the Lambs.""Unfortunately, the other characters, almost without exception, embody the crassest stereotypes.  Especially galling is the character of the boy's mother, who on at least three occasions, is shown ordering or eating enormous amounts of food, and at one point, actually has a heart attack.  It would have been far more interesting had Joey Lauren Adams played the boy's mother, with Gary Sinise abandoning her for the other character.

668492,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005NGAN,Tsuyoshi,"[7, 9]","Bruno (Alex D. Linz of ""Home Alone 3"") is a boy in a Catholic school.  Other boys, however, always picks on him, and his superior nun (Kathy Bates) is not particularly kind to Bruno  and his mother, considering them just another troublemakers.  And his estranged father (Gary Sinise), a local policeman now dating with another girl (Joey Lauren Adams, ""Chasing Amy"") avoids his ex-wife and son, also thinking them as a disgrace  when one day Bruno is hit by a car, sent to hospital, and found ... wearing girl's dress.  The last point represents the message of this film  directed by Shirley MacLaine, who also appears as Bruno's grandmother.  (This is her debut as a director of feature-length film though she once co-directed a documentary film ""The Other Half of the Sky"" in the past.)  A boy Bruno loves wearing girl's clothes, and he finally shows the people around him that to be different is OK.Alex D. Linz portrays Bruno's gradual recognition of his true self-esteem with charm, and Shirley MacLaine, as always, shows her gifted comic sense as his plucky grandmother who comes to understand him.  Though I found Gary Sinise overacting, trying to give stress on father's anguish, the acting is uniformly good, including newcomer Stacey Halperin playing Bruno's ""Diva"" mother.  There is also a cameo appearance of Jennifer Tilly, but it was a too short one for me as Joey Lauren Adams's.The film proves that Shirley MacLaine has a talent as a director, always keeping the ball rolling, but at some places the film suffers from its inefficient script that clearly needs re-writing.  Some viewers might feel dismayed at the negative descriptions of the teaching nuns, one of them played by Kathy Bates, who, after Bruno was picked on in school, unaccountably preaches and scolds Bruno, not his bullies.  And that happens more than once, which makes me wondering why his mother doesn't think of sending him away from such a horrible place.  But the film's has a more fundamental problem with the way of presenting Bruno's wish of wearing girl's clothes, which is not developed enough to convey the fiim's precious message.  At one place, Bruno narrates that he watched a dream of being chased by angels, and clad in white, he insists in front of the angry  superior nun that what he is wearing is holy vestment.  But later he is dressed in a cowgirl costume, which confuses the point he made before.  Does he just want to be dressed like a girl?  Or an angel, which he sees several times in his visions?This could be a minor thing if I didn't see an European film dealing with the same topic, Alain Berliner's ""Ma Vie en Rose,"" which, with all respect to Ms MacLaine's work, should be considered better made.  As a whole ""The Dress Code"" is a promising work from a respected actoress, whose name, however, deserves a little better treatment of the theme.""The Dress Code"" was given a theatrical (though limited) release in Japan in 2001 with its original title ""Bruno,"" prior to American release.",3,A Good Drama with a Message Directed by Respected MacLaine,1020902400,"05 9, 2002",2002,2999,"['Bruno', 'Alex', 'D.', 'Linz', 'Home', 'Alone', '3', 'boy', 'Catholic', 'school', 'Other', 'boys', 'however', 'always', 'picks', 'superior', 'nun', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'not', 'particularly', 'kind', 'Bruno', 'mother', 'considering', 'just', 'troublemakers', 'estranged', 'father', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'local', 'policeman', 'now', 'dating', 'girl', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'ex-wife', 'son', 'also', 'thinking', 'disgrace', 'when', 'one', 'day', 'Bruno', 'hit', 'car', 'sent', 'hospital', 'found', 'wearing', 'girl', 'dress', 'last', 'point', 'message', 'film', 'directed', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'who', 'also', 'Bruno', 'grandmother', 'debut', 'director', 'feature-length', 'film', 'once', 'co-directed', 'documentary', 'film', 'Other', 'Half', 'Sky', 'past', 'boy', 'Bruno', 'wearing', 'girl', 'clothes', 'finally', 'people', 'be', 'different', 'OK.Alex', 'D.', 'Linz', 'Bruno', 'gradual', 'recognition', 'true', 'self-esteem', 'charm', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'always', 'gifted', 'comic', 'sense', 'plucky', 'grandmother', 'who', 'understand', 'found', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'overacting', 'trying', 'give', 'stress', 'father', 'anguish', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'good', 'including', 'newcomer', 'Stacey', 'Halperin', 'playing', 'Bruno', 'Diva', 'mother', 'also', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'one', 'Joey', 'Lauren', ""Adams's.The"", 'film', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'talent', 'director', 'always', 'keeping', 'ball', 'rolling', 'places', 'film', 'suffers', 'inefficient', 'script', 'clearly', 're-writing', 'viewers', 'might', 'feel', 'dismayed', 'negative', 'descriptions', 'teaching', 'nuns', 'one', 'played', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'who', 'Bruno', 'was', 'picked', 'school', 'unaccountably', 'preaches', 'scolds', 'Bruno', 'not', 'bullies', 'more', 'once', 'wondering', 'why', 'mother', ""n't"", 'think', 'sending', 'away', 'such', 'horrible', 'place', 'film', 'more', 'fundamental', 'problem', 'way', 'presenting', 'Bruno', 'wish', 'wearing', 'girl', 'clothes', 'not', 'developed', 'enough', 'convey', 'fiim', 'precious', 'message', 'one', 'place', 'Bruno', 'watched', 'dream', 'being', 'chased', 'angels', 'clad', 'white', 'front', 'angry', 'superior', 'nun', 'what', 'wearing', 'holy', 'vestment', 'later', 'dressed', 'cowgirl', 'costume', 'point', 'made', 'Does', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'dressed', 'girl', 'angel', 'several', 'times', 'visions', 'could', 'be', 'minor', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'European', 'film', 'dealing', 'same', 'topic', 'Alain', 'Berliner', 'Ma', 'Vie', 'en', 'Rose', 'respect', 'Ms', 'MacLaine', 'work', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'better', 'made', 'whole', 'Dress', 'Code', 'promising', 'work', 'respected', 'actoress', 'name', 'however', 'little', 'better', 'treatment', 'theme', 'Dress', 'Code', 'was', 'given', 'theatrical', 'limited', 'release', 'Japan', '2001', 'original', 'title', 'Bruno', 'prior', 'American', 'release']",N/A
