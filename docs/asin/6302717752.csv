329074,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,6302717752,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[2, 3]","""Intruder In The Dust""(MGM, 1949)This postwar social drama, based on a novel by William Faulkner, is naturally compared to Harper Lee's ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" which was written and adapted into a film over a decade later.  Both are soul-searching novels written by white intellectuals bent on examining how the virulent racism of the post-Reconstruction South was not simply morally repugnant, but also corrosive to the souls and lives of Southern whites, and to their children as well. This 1949 film ""Intruder In The Dust"" is perhaps not as dramatically nuanced as ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" (or Faulkner's original novel) but it is no less historically compelling.  The film's power comes early on with remorseless scenes of a small-town mob bent on seeing a black man lynched for the supposed murder of a seedy white local.The scenes in which large crowds seethe with hatred and ooze unhealthy anticipation of violence to come, of an entire town throwing a tailgate party outside the jail, and of a crowd parting respectfully for a vigilante carrying a can of gasoline (to burn the prisoner with, inside his cell) are all quite chilling.  Even more striking is the passivity and matter-of-fact acceptance of even the more liberal whites of the ""justice"" to come: if you kill a white man, what do you expect is going to happen? This isn't some trumped-up, exaggerated Hollywood version of Southern racism -- if anything, it's a tremendous understatement, particularly with the ""happy ending"" accorded the accused in this story which didn't exist in hundreds of real-life cases.  Some of the dramatic moments have an odd ring, particularly those dealing with the difficulties individuals had bridging the social gaps between black and white. Still, the film is a powerful indictment of the violence used to reinforce white supremacy, and is remarkable as a document of the black experience in the years before the Civil Rights era (including the years after this forward-thinking film was made.) Sadly, some of the issues addressed here are still with us today, decades after the march on Washington and all that came in its wake, one more reason that this movie is definitely worth watching.

329076,AYA9ZUS9Z0BVW,6302717752,"Jane Pensive ""a film fan""","[5, 6]","...director Clarence Brown (reputed to be Greta Garbo's favorite director) shows his chops with this very interesting film about murder, lynching and racial hatred in a small southern town in what looks to be the 1930's (the film is made in 1950). The black and white documentary style appears to be influenced by Italian neo realism, which makes Brown's achievement notable for a director who started in silent films. The tempo is fast, the tension as nicely built as a Hitchcock suspense thriller, and the story by William Faulkner is absorbing. I was sucked right into the characters' placid, but dangerous world of racial separatism. Brown gets good performances from his experienced character actors, Elizabeth Patterson, Porter Hall, and Will Geer (before he was blacklisted). Although Claude Jarman Jr is pretty wide-eyed and non-plussed throughout the film, his character, a teen-aged boy, is charged with saving his black friend from a lynch mob, so I guess wide eyes are appropriate for that situation. Of course the acting award goes to Juano Hernandez as the proud and innocent man charged with shooting a white man in the back.

329077,A106016KSI0YQ,6302717752,Jay Dickson,"[10, 11]","It's almost impossible to think that this 1949 film was made by the same studio, MGM, that earlier in the decade had still been depicting small-town life in Andy Hardy terms. The studio asked Clarence Brown to make this adaptation of a William Faulkner novel, which was a terrific choice: Brown was himself a Southerner, and lavished careful attention to this adaptation (which many consider his best film), so that the film, shot in and around Faulkner's own hometown of Oxford, Mississippi (which any Faulknerian knows is the original for Faulkner's Jefferson, the seat of his mythical Yoknapatawpha County), has a wonderful authentic feel to it. The center of the film is an elderly African-American farmer, Lucas Beauchamp (Juano Hernandez), who refuses to avert his eyes in the presence of or to defer to the town's white folk. When a white man who had become enraged by Lucas's manner earlier is found shot to death in the back with Lucas standing over him with a warm pistol, Lucas is not only arrested but put in danger of imminent lynching; a teenager (THE YEARLING's Claude Jarman, Jr.), who had previously been tormented by his offending Lucas by trying to pay him for hospitality, begs his lawyer uncle (David Brian) to take Lucas's case.The cinematography is so sharp and imaginative that it's often genuinely astonishing. There are genuinely great sequences, including a traveling shot from Lucas's POV of the suspicious menacing white townsmen--their faces hardened into masks--as he is frogmarched to the county jail; a scene between Lucas and the teenager, Chick, through the diamond shaped grillholes of a jail cell; and a haunted moonlit forest as Chick, a friend, and an old townswoman (who all believe Lucas was set up) return to the dead man's burial site to dig up his corpse. Two of the performances are extraordinary: Hernandez as the unbending Lucas, and Porter Hall as the murdered man's one-armed father. These performances, like the cinematography, have an uncanny hyperrealism to them that almost overcome the burden of the horrible character of Chick's uncle (David Brian), who keeps mouthing stupid pieties and weighs down the whole picture.",4,"""The keeper of our conscience""",1302825600,"04 15, 2011",2011,2173,"['almost', 'impossible', 'think', '1949', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'same', 'studio', 'MGM', 'earlier', 'decade', 'had', 'still', 'been', 'depicting', 'small-town', 'life', 'Andy', 'Hardy', 'terms', 'studio', 'asked', 'Clarence', 'Brown', 'make', 'adaptation', 'William', 'Faulkner', 'novel', 'was', 'terrific', 'choice', 'Brown', 'was', 'Southerner', 'lavished', 'careful', 'attention', 'adaptation', 'many', 'consider', 'best', 'film', 'so', 'film', 'shot', 'Faulkner', 'own', 'hometown', 'Oxford', 'Mississippi', 'Faulknerian', 'knows', 'original', 'Faulkner', 'Jefferson', 'seat', 'mythical', 'Yoknapatawpha', 'County', 'wonderful', 'authentic', 'feel', 'center', 'film', 'elderly', 'African-American', 'farmer', 'Lucas', 'Beauchamp', 'Juano', 'Hernandez', 'who', 'avert', 'eyes', 'presence', 'defer', 'town', 'white', 'folk', 'When', 'white', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'become', 'enraged', 'Lucas', 'manner', 'earlier', 'found', 'shot', 'death', 'back', 'Lucas', 'standing', 'warm', 'pistol', 'Lucas', 'not', 'only', 'arrested', 'put', 'danger', 'imminent', 'lynching', 'teenager', 'THE', 'YEARLING', 'Claude', 'Jarman', 'Jr.', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'been', 'tormented', 'offending', 'Lucas', 'trying', 'pay', 'hospitality', 'begs', 'lawyer', 'uncle', 'David', 'Brian', 'take', 'Lucas', 'case.The', 'cinematography', 'so', 'sharp', 'imaginative', 'often', 'genuinely', 'astonishing', 'are', 'genuinely', 'great', 'sequences', 'including', 'traveling', 'shot', 'Lucas', 'POV', 'suspicious', 'menacing', 'white', 'townsmen', 'hardened', 'masks', 'frogmarched', 'county', 'jail', 'scene', 'Lucas', 'teenager', 'Chick', 'diamond', 'shaped', 'grillholes', 'jail', 'cell', 'haunted', 'moonlit', 'forest', 'Chick', 'friend', 'old', 'townswoman', 'who', 'believe', 'Lucas', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'return', 'dead', 'man', 'burial', 'site', 'dig', 'up', 'corpse', 'Two', 'performances', 'are', 'extraordinary', 'Hernandez', 'unbending', 'Lucas', 'Porter', 'Hall', 'murdered', 'man', 'one-armed', 'father', 'performances', 'cinematography', 'have', 'uncanny', 'hyperrealism', 'almost', 'overcome', 'burden', 'horrible', 'character', 'Chick', 'uncle', 'David', 'Brian', 'who', 'mouthing', 'stupid', 'pieties', 'down', 'whole', 'picture']",Intruder in the Dust VHS
329078,A6S7155T8VTHK,6302717752,J. F. McCausland,"[2, 2]","Intruder in the Dust was based on William Faulkner's book of the same name that won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1949. Unfortunately both the book and the film have sort of faded into obscurity. Not only was the book written by one of America's best authors, the film was directed by the fabulous Clarence Brown, who also brought us Flesh and the Devil, Anna Christie, Anna Karenina, Of Human Hearts, The Human Comedy, National Velvet, and The Yearling. The story is set in Faulkner's hometown of Oxford, Mississippi. African-American farmer Lucas Beauchamp is well-known as a man who will not kow-tow to whites, a trait which does not serve him well when he is discovered standing over the dead body of a white man holding a gun that has been recently fired. He insists on his innocence and pleads with local lawyer, Gavin Stevens, to take his case. Stevens refuses, believing it to be an open and shut case. Besides, this being the deep South, Beauchamp is unlikely to survive until a trial can be held. In fact, most locals believe the accused will be lynched before the weekend is over. However, Steven's nephew, Chick Mallison, was once helped by Beauchamp, and believing in his innocence, intercedes, pleading with his uncle to take the case. To Kill a Mockingbird was a much more famous and popular adaptation of another famous courtroom trial book set in the South; most likely Gregory Peck and his outstanding performance as Atticus Finch contributed greatly to it's fame and fortune. However, Intruder in the Dust is possibly (possibly) a better film, albeit one with a much less famous cast. David Brian, Claude Jarman, Jr., and Juano Hernandez play the three central characters, and I would be hard pressed to say which gives the best performance. Together, they are quite probably the single best trio ever to play together. Together, they each bring out the best in one another. Together, they create a real feel for the old, deep South on the verge of historic change. (I hesitate to say they are typical, because none of the characters are stereotypes, not at all. But I spent a fair share of time in the South and I know these characters! Some of them are my relatives!) Filming in Oxford, and using local residents for extras, really aids in the realistic depiction of a Southern rural town. Clarence Brown utilizes  some intriguing camera angles and lighting to help create the dusty fusty ambiance of the slow pace of life in a small Southern town. Intruder in the Dust is a bit of an odd duck in that it clearly focuses on the realities, difficulties, and brutalities of a time and place when racism was not merely an unspoken way of life, it was actually the law of the land. Yet it doesn't take the easy route and portray characters as stereotypes. The characters are much more complicated than that. Beauchamp is not entirely likeable, yet still the audience feels the horror of the injustice inflicted on him. Chick, the young man, is perhaps the embodiment of the idea that the children are our future. Despite everything, as horrifying and depressing and sad as this film is, it still gives a sense of hope through Chick.

Actually filmed in Oxford, Mississippi, Faulkner's hometown, and using local residents as extras, there's a ring of authenticity about it.There's tension throughout, from the very beginning when the dignified Lucas Beauchamp, played by Juano Hernandez is arrested for supposedly shooting a white man in the back.  There's a huge crowd of white people lining the streets but there is absolute silence as the thud of  Beauchamp's footsteps echo as he is led to the jail.  A young white teenage boy, played by Claude Jamen, Jr., who had been befriended by the dignified Beauchamp several years before, convinces his uncle, played by David Brian, to help save Beauchamp from the inevitable lynching.I thought the story was a good one as it kept me glued to the screen, not even walking away when my computer signaled that fresh e-mail had arrived.  But yet, with the exception of Porter Hall who played the one-armed father of the murdered man and Elizabeth Patterson, cast as the feisty elderly lady who instigated the investigation and single handedly delayed the potential lynching, the performances of the leading characters seemed wooden.

329081,A32TMOF2D4V4U0,6302717752,L. Spain,"[10, 12]","(Please note that there are a couple of spoilers in this review)This 1949 film doesn't look like, or sound like, anything that came out of Hollywood's major studios during the Forties. As a former film student, I'd say it's a sure bet that the director, Clarence Brown, his screenwriter, Ben Maddow, and his cinematographer, Robert Surtees, were influenced by the new Italian neo-realist genre that used naturalistic or location settings, documentary cinematographic techniques, and non-professional performers to create an intensely realistic film experience for the audience. In this respect, ""Intruder in the Dust"" packs a unique visual punch, because the drama doesn't feel forced; instead, it kind of rises out of the observation of the details of the place and the time in which the events of the plot were filmed. It is important to remember that lynchings of victims of all races --  though most were overwhelmingly African-American - still occurred in the South at the time this film was made.Since ""Intruder in the Dust"" plays almost like a documentary, it's hard to single out most of the performances for any special praise, because the characters are not written in bold strokes or flourishes. The two that do stand out do so because they carry the greatest burden of advancing the film's action and exposition: the protagonist, Juano Hernandez, who plays the proud, self-reliant African-American farmer, Lucas Beauchamp, accused of murdering a white man, and Elizabeth Patterson, who plays an elderly spinster with a strong moral conscience and a formidable amount of courage in the face of pure, unadulterated race-hatred.And yet, for most of the film's tightly constructed length, Lucas Beauchamp, the terrorized character who is ensnared in a life-threatening crisis, has a presence that comes off as more symbolic than dramatic. He's like a catalyst that sets off a series of events that provide the white characters with a platform, or soapbox, from which they pontificate eloquently about the weaknesses of human character, and the violence that lurks within men's souls. There's no doubt he's strong-willed, haughty, and perhaps even imperious in the way he quietly expresses his disdain for the white mob that can't wait to torture him and kill him. It's just that it seems that the only thing that serves to establish his purpose in the plot is his skin color mixed with a little attitude, which I feel limits one's ability to sympathize with him.That is not to say, however, that Juano Hernandez' performance lacks affect. On the contrary, he picks the bones of the filmmakers' meager outline of his character and manages to wring some amount of dignity and personal power out of it. Interestingly enough, much of the impression he made on me was physical, which is a result of the clothes that he wears, such as that too-white-to-touch hat that he arranges so cockily on his head like a warning sign that clears the sidewalks when he strides into town, and the contrasting dark, maxi-length coat draping his large frame highlights his swaggering, insolent gait as coolly and iconically as the one Neo wears in ""The Matrix"" trilogy.Still,  without any revelation of what has made him so aloof , he comes dangerously close to being a one-dimensional figure, a cut-out character that one can only react to, negatively or positively, rather than empathize with.For example, in the scarce scenes that take place within his house on his farm, we see what appears to be an elderly African-American woman who sits quietly in her rocking chair without speaking a word of dialogue. Later, after she dies, we find out that she was Lucas' wife...but how could we have known that? It's a surprise without a pay-off. Not only does she look like she's old enough to be his grandmother, but more importantly, nothing happens between her and Lucas; no conversation, no mutual expressions of caring or affection. It's as though the deprivation and racial terror that the blacks live under has pre-empted their right to possess deep feelings. It's possible that this portrayal of the absence of a vivid interior life for the black characters was an intentional device employed by the filmmakers to dramatize the spirit-withering effects of forced impoverishment and legalized inequality on their lives. However, for me at least, it only robs them of any personality. They are frozen in a timeless world of unending misery, wthout hope, without dreams of a better life. I don't believe blacks could have survived the horiffic forces of racist evil prevalent in those times in such a passive, fatalistic way. Hardship only destroys those who don't possess the will to live. Obviously, blacks had it in abundance, or they wouldn't be here.To my mind, the only place in the film where any truly affecting emotion breaks through is when the father of the murdered white man reacts to the discovery of his son's dead body. The speechless grief, the wrenching ache of sudden loss radiating from his tired eyes and stoic face is powerful, genuinely heart-breaking, and jarringly unexpected in a film as rigorously unemotional as this one is. His deep and obviously unconditional love for his son is painfully and sympathetically projected into our hearts. It allow us to identify with him, to bond with him in his sorrow, regardless of his role in the film. Nothing even remotely like this is allowed in Lucas Beauchamp's world.Nonetheless, somehow this film manages to make its point about the injustice of racism, although in a spare, subdued, unadorned way. Even more, it demonstrates convincingly the tragic consequences of racist violence on the lives of the perpetrators, which is saying a lot. Perhaps William Faulkner's novel has the depth, the texture, and the observation of detail that if it could have been incorporated into this film would have made it a more emotionally involving viewing experience.",3,A reasonably honest effort at confronting the culture of violent racism in the Deep South,1307836800,"06 12, 2011",2011,5912,"['Please', 'note', 'are', 'couple', 'spoilers',
