The DVD brings an end to the perpetual subbed vs dubbed argument by allowing you to choose.  The animation and story are  good and this is a DVD that I rewatch frequently.I do have a few  complaints, mostly the packaging.  This is not packaged as a DVD, but in  normal jewel boxes and packed more like software than as a DVD set.  Also,  for a series that isn't really very long, it seems strange that the set  requires 3 DVDs.Complaints aside, I recommend this series to anime fans.",4,Classic Anime,944784000,"12 10, 1999",1999,579,"['Bubblegum', 'Crisis', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'anime', 'what', 'brought', 'Anime', 'American', 'mainstream', 'DVD', 'end', 'perpetual', 'subbed', 'vs', 'dubbed', 'argument', 'allowing', 'choose', 'animation', 'story', 'are', 'good', 'DVD', 'rewatch', 'frequently.I', 'do', 'have', 'few', 'complaints', 'mostly', 'packaging', 'not', 'packaged', 'DVD', 'normal', 'jewel', 'boxes', 'packed', 'more', 'software', 'DVD', 'set', 'Also', 'series', ""n't"", 'really', 'very', 'long', 'strange', 'set', '3', 'DVDs.Complaints', 'aside', 'recommend', 'series', 'anime', 'fans']",Bubblegum Crisis Collection

Nothing comes close.The quality of the DVD is excellent, and the subtitles seem to be pretty accurate (I'm measuring them against a  fun-subtitle job).If you're looking for the one piece of anime to buy or  view, this is it. Lodoss War and Tenchi Muyo are good (I love Tenchi Muyo),  but Bubblegum Crisis is the best piece of anime available by a mile.I  just wish that they had made more than 8 episodes (Bubblegum Crash does NOT  count).

451592,AGR4LKC72JEQ8,6305156441,coopertex,"[4, 4]","Bubblegum Crisis 2030 ovas (1-8) sci-fi/action: set in the same universe as A.D. Police Files, this is several years into the future. The secret vigilante group known as the Knight Sabers has been formed. They arrive earlier than the A.D.  Police to the crime scenes and usually destroy the boomers without their help. The quality of this anime is equal to the A.D.Polic Files. (mentioned above). The Knight Sabers are women that work undercover along with a rich mistress named Sylia. They wear these mecha outfits which they call hard suits. Their sole purpose is to destroy renegade boomers which are causing public harm; they never handle human/ civilian crimes ( they leave that up to the regular police). Most of the episodes are self-contained stories, but it is good to watch all 8 of them for continuity. The animation is fluid, the character designs and backdrop of a futuristic Tokyo are beautiful, like a world based on Bladerunner. The action is gritty and gory. And the stories are interesting albit cynical. The only problem with this series was the lack interesting characters: something which is corrected in the next series. Blood and gore, light nudity, for adults only. The episodes are also self contained, except for the last 2 episodes which continued. Ends on 8 then connects with the anime Bubblegum Crisis 2040",4,Bladerunner-World,1077062400,"02 18, 2004",2004,1336,"['Bubblegum', 'Crisis', '2030', 'ovas', '1-8', 'sci-fi/action', 'set', 'same', 'universe', 'A.D.', 'Police', 'Files', 'several', 'years', 'future', 'secret', 'vigilante', 'group', 'known', 'Knight', 'Sabers', 'been', 'formed', 'arrive', 'earlier', 'A.D.', 'Police', 'crime', 'scenes', 'usually', 'destroy', 'boomers', 'help', 'quality', 'anime', 'equal', 'A.D.Polic', 'Files', 'mentioned', 'Knight', 'Sabers', 'are', 'women', 'work', 'undercover', 'along', 'rich', 'mistress', 'named', 'Sylia', 'wear', 'mecha', 'outfits', 'call', 'hard', 'suits', 'sole', 'purpose', 'destroy', 'renegade', 'boomers', 'are', 'causing', 'public', 'harm', 'never', 'handle', 'human/', 'civilian', 'crimes', 'leave', 'up', 'regular', 'police', 'Most', 'episodes', 'are', 'self-contained', 'stories', 'good', 'watch', '8', 'continuity', 'animation', 'fluid', 'character', 'designs', 'backdrop', 'futuristic', 'Tokyo', 'are', 'beautiful', 'world', 'based', 'Bladerunner', 'action', 'gritty', 'gory', 'stories', 'are', 'interesting', 'albit', 'cynical', 'only', 'problem', 'series', 'was', 'lack', 'interesting', 'characters', 'something', 'corrected', 'next', 'series', 'Blood', 'gore', 'light', 'nudity', 'adults', 'only', 'episodes', 'are', 'also', 'self', 'contained', 'last', '2', 'episodes', 'continued', 'Ends', '8', 'then', 'connects', 'anime', 'Bubblegum', 'Crisis', '2040']",Bubblegum Crisis Collection

To me, BGC remains one of the standbys of modern anime fare. We have all the right stuff: likeable and striking characters, a gothic  cyberpunk setting, hardcore mecha combat action, and ....well, J-pop idol  music. It's not as silly as it sounds, either.  Most importantly, the  storylines touch the heart as well as thill the senses. We have plots  motivated by revenge, bitterness, sorrow, the desire for justice and  obsession. They make a lasting impression even in today's age of  CGI-enhanced animation. I will agree with my fellow reviewers: the  packaging was just silly. It was on my software store's shelf for weeks  before I realized it was a DVD set and not one of those jukeboxes. Also, I  will warn others that the subtitling is embarassingly out of sync in places  on disc 2. Still, with these meager flaws, this is a set that no sci-fi  enthusiast can be without.",5,BGC - - A prerequisite for anime fandom.,932256000,"07 18, 1999",1999,967,"['Having', 'been', 'fan', 'BGC', '1994', 'was', 'overjoyed', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'BGC', 'one', 'standbys', 'modern', 'anime', 'fare', 'have', 'right', 'stuff', 'likeable', 'striking', 'characters', 'gothic', 'cyberpunk', 'setting', 'hardcore', 'mecha', 'combat', 'action', '.well', 'J-pop', 'idol', 'music', 'not', 'as', 'silly', 'either', 'Most', 'importantly', 'storylines', 'heart', 'as', 'well', 'thill', 'senses', 'have', 'plots', 'motivated', 'revenge', 'bitterness', 'sorrow', 'desire', 'justice', 'obsession', 'make', 'lasting', 'impression', 'even', 'today', 'age', 'CGI-enhanced', 'animation', 'will', 'agree', 'fellow', 'reviewers', 'packaging', 'was', 'just', 'silly', 'was', 'software', 'store', 'shelf', 'weeks', 'realized', 'was', 'DVD', 'set', 'not', 'one', 'jukeboxes', 'Also', 'will', 'warn', 'others', 'subtitling', 'embarassingly', 'sync', 'places', 'disc', '2', 'Still', 'meager', 'flaws', 'set', 'sci-fi', 'enthusiast', 'can', 'be']",Bubblegum Crisis Collection

451595,A65M76UVJYRK3,6305156441,sean,"[3, 6]","""Bubblegum Crisis"" is an interesting production that seemed to get exponentially better as the series continued.  The first three episodes almost completely turned me off to the series.  But, it was sunday, i had nothing to do, and only 5 more episodes to complete the series.When i sceptiacally threw in the second DVD i was pleasantly surprised.  The first three episodes were very bland.  Dark film was waay overused the voice acting was nothing to write home about(English) and the stories ...well, there wasn't much.  Just work your way to the climactic fight at the end of each episode.Episodes 4 through 8 were Much Better.  The Artwork remained the same, but the intros improved and all of the sudden we have some really interesting stories that involve outside characters (kind of how Bebop did with ""Heavy Metal Queen"" and ""Jupiter Jazz""...deviating from a concrete plot line)  It really worked.  I am very surprised that the series was only 8 episodes long.  That was kind of dissapointing.  It wasn't toward the middle of the series that i started to really enjoy it.  And there was no conclusion to the series at all!! None!!!On the Plus side, I was really impressed with the artwork. Considering how spoiled we are with recent releases, ""Bubblegum Crisis"" is drawn very well and you can easily see how Anime Titles like ""Iria,"" and others were infulenced.Let's talk for just a few seconds about the Unnessary but very enjoyable ""Boobage"" shots!  There were only like 4 during the whole series and they were super unneccesary.  I guess the production team was like ""Hey.. wanna see what they look like without their uniforms??""  Well, there you have it!""  These not sexual in nature, but really funny.  I guess you could say they remind me of the girls-locker-room scenes you would see in ""B"" movies from the eighties.  2 seconds of lacy underwear and brief nudity going from civilian clothes to fighting armor (with some kid always trying to sneak a peak) just made me laugh to myself!  It's really funny !Anywho - Even after seeing it, I really don't know all that much about ""Bubblegum Crisis,"" other than what i've told you + only 8 episodes long and dated 1987.  Was it an OAV from a manga series?I was a little turbed with the length of this series, and that lack of closure.  I hope the sequals are somwhat enjoyable, I'll have to rent them.To sum it all up, ""Bubblegum Crisis"" is a Very enjoyable little series with enough for everyone.  Good fighting, A little graphic violence, motercycle chases, Androids, and a little ""boobage"" What i thought was going to be just an average anime gets 4 stars from me.
