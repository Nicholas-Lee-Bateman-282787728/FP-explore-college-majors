7560,A2582KMXLK2P06,0767804236,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","It would have been GREAT going to this school.  Well... let me correct myself.  It would have been great for a couple minutes just to discover how devious and ruthless these kids are only to witness several unintentional bits of disgusting or inappropriate humor unravel before my eyes.It's about Jon Lovitz becoming a teacher at a rundown high school where all the students are troublemakers and care VERY litlte about sitting still and learning.  Actually that's the understatement of the century- these teens are downright ignorant and dislike learning with a *passion*.When Jon's character first sets foot into the school, he's totally oblivious to the fact these teens are ready to tear him a new rear end just for being somewhere he CLEARLY doesn't belong based on his eagerness to teach.  All the teens make fun of him when they realize how nerdy and out of place he is!This is the kind of comedy that's *really* over the top, so expect all jokes to pertain to making fun of women (especially the unattractive gym teacher and principal), showing very little respect for the school system (by shooting thousands of spitballs at the chalkboard and dealing with all kinds of diverse students including a mother who actually brings her kids to school, lol) and really, there's so many segments and additional characters that are completely absurd that you really have to sit back and admire all this nonsense and realize that it's about as far-fetched as a school can possibly be!The storyline... well that too is completely insane.  It's about Jon Lovitz retrieving the REAL test results so he can set a good example for his students, and collecting a suitcase of money that was once in the possession of these criminals at a restaurant.  From here several misadventures take place involving gangs and guns.I can see myself watching this movie several more times over the course of my life.  It holds up remarkably well for being a movie released in 1996.  The humor is relevant and perhaps always will be.

7562,ADKZOXAOV8EXD,0767804236,Doctor.Generosity,"[4, 4]","Movies like this don't get much respect but this one is really cute. The plot is nothing special, a predictable comedy formula; Jon Lovitz is a bumbling but good-hearted schlemiel of a teacher in a wild inner city school. But the movie is well written with great jokes and sight gags. At the beginning, Lovitz is teaching in a fancy private school, where the receptionist answers the phone ""Are you white?"" before she directs the call. The depiction of the mean, arrogant rich boys who study there is painfully accurate. Then he moves to the ghetto school where there is a reserved parking space for the SWAT team. Guards patrol the upper tier of the school auditorium just like a state prison yard. There are many such brilliant touches and Jon Lovitz is loveable as always.Tia Carrere is as lovely as any Hollywood actress could be. Really a beautiful woman, at least as good an actress as Cameron Diaz, and better than Demi Moore.

Back when I first saw it, I would've gave a five stars but now its four stars because the movie loses steam after the i hour mark and the jokes start to become hit or miss.

Richard believes that he can make a difference there and on his way he falls for a gorgeous teacher called Victoria Chappell(Tia Carrere).High School High was a spoof on those troubled high school kids movies like Dangerous Minds, Lean On Me and Stand And Deliver. Unlike the crap that passes for parody(like anything by Seltzer and Friedberg) HSH hits all its targets and actually has a story tied to the spoof. Compare that with spoofs that are just about picking on pop culture and meaningless gags. Jon Lovitz was hysterical and as a comedic actor he never got enough credit. Tia Carrere was gorgeous as well as funny and Louise Fletcher was funny to as the irascible school principal. Mekhi Phifer as well as the supporting cast add to the laughs too.
