745447,A3FNOMJG1MKQYG,B00008NFR4,,"[3, 3]","The Emperor's Club is actually based on the novel ""The Palace Thief"" with minor changes to the big screen.Kevin Kline plays Mr. Hundert, a professor at St. Benedict's Academy who teaches Roman and Greek Civilation with special thoughts on some of the greatest philosophers of the time, such as Aristotle, Socrates, Plato and Julius Cesar.Every year, the school has a Mr. Julius Cesar competition, in which the Top 3 students in the class get to compete for the award, which is the most prestigous award at the school. The students include Martin, Deepak, and Louis. Then enters Sedgewick Bell, the son of a United States Senator.Sedgewick is a bit of an attention wanting rebel (his father doesn't really care about him). Sedgewick enters St. Benedicts and immediately begins to not only make friends, but also change the makeup of the kids in the school as they start to become a bit more carefree like Sedgewick.After Mr. Hundert speaks with Sedgewick's father, Sedgewick begins to change as a student and starts to study and put his time and effort into making a run for Mr. Julius Cesar, but he falls exactly 1 point short. In the final test before the contest, Sedgewick gets and A-, 92 overall and finishes 4th behind Martin (93), whose father was a former Julius Cesar. Feeling that Sedgewick has earned the chance for Mr. Julius Cesar, he gives him an A+ and Sedgewick finishes in the Top 3.During the actual contest, Mr. Hendrick figures out that Sedgewick is actually cheating during the contest and later confronts him only to not give him a straight answer when Sedgewick asked why he didn't rat him out.25 years later and Sedgewick wants a chance for redemption. He gets a hold of the students from that day for a 25 year reunion and new contest of the Mr. Julius Cesar event. During the contest, again Mr. Hundert finds out that Sedgewick is cheating and again he loses, only this time, after loosing, he announces that his real reason behind the get together was to announce that he was running for his father's senatorial seat.Hundert confronts Sedgewick about the cheating again, only to have Sedgewick explain to him that he lives in a real world, where lying and cheating, although unethical are necessary to survive.It is a clash between old moral and ethic values of conquest with contribution and new moral and ethic values regarding conquest without contribution.Finally, Mr. Hundert confronts Martin and tells him that all those years ago, he was actually the 3rd person for the Mr. Julius Ceasar contest but was passed over for Sedgewick.The film ends with Mr. Hundert again teaching only this time, to have another student enter the class late. This time, the student is Martin's son, who like his father, has been raised on the moral and ethical values of the teachings of Mr. Hundert.Overall, The Emperor's Club is a great movie about moral and ethics and as pointed out several times by Mr. Hundert, on how history will remember you.""Great ambition and conquest without contribution is without significance.""",5,excellent movie about moral ethics,1271635200,"04 19, 2010",2010,3037,"['Emperor', 'Club', 'actually', 'based', 'novel', 'Palace', 'Thief', 'minor', 'changes', 'big', 'screen.Kevin', 'Kline', 'Mr.', 'Hundert', 'professor', 'St.', 'Benedict', 'Academy', 'who', 'Roman', 'Greek', 'Civilation', 'special', 'thoughts', 'greatest', 'philosophers', 'time', 'such', 'Aristotle', 'Socrates', 'Plato', 'Julius', 'Cesar.Every', 'year', 'school', 'Mr.', 'Julius', 'Cesar', 'competition', 'Top', '3', 'students', 'class', 'get', 'compete', 'award', 'most', 'prestigous', 'award', 'school', 'students', 'include', 'Martin', 'Deepak', 'Louis', 'Then', 'Sedgewick', 'Bell', 'son', 'United', 'States', 'Senator.Sedgewick', 'bit', 'attention', 'wanting', 'rebel', 'father', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'Sedgewick', 'enters', 'St.', 'Benedicts', 'immediately', 'not', 'only', 'make', 'friends', 'also', 'change', 'makeup', 'kids', 'school', 'start', 'become', 'bit', 'more', 'carefree', 'Sedgewick.After', 'Mr.', 'Hundert', 'Sedgewick', 'father', 'Sedgewick', 'change', 'student', 'study', 'put', 'time', 'effort', 'making', 'run', 'Mr.', 'Julius', 'Cesar', 'exactly', '1', 'point', 'short', 'final', 'test', 'contest', 'Sedgewick', 'A-', '92', 'overall', '4th', 'Martin', '93', 'father', 'was', 'former', 'Julius', 'Cesar', 'Feeling', 'Sedgewick', 'earned', 'chance', 'Mr.', 'Julius', 'Cesar', 'A+', 'Sedgewick', 'finishes', 'Top', '3.During', 'actual', 'contest', 'Mr.', 'Hendrick', 'out', 'Sedgewick', 'actually', 'cheating', 'contest', 'later', 'confronts', 'only', 'not', 'give', 'straight', 'answer', 'when', 'Sedgewick', 'asked', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'rat', 'out.25', 'years', 'later', 'Sedgewick', 'chance', 'redemption', 'hold', 'students', 'day', '25', 'year', 'reunion', 'new', 'contest', 'Mr.', 'Julius', 'Cesar', 'event', 'contest', 'again', 'Mr.', 'Hundert', 'out', 'Sedgewick', 'cheating', 'again', 'only', 'time', 'loosing', 'real', 'reason', 'get', 'together', 'was', 'announce', 'was', 'running', 'father', 'senatorial', 'seat.Hundert', 'confronts', 'Sedgewick', 'cheating', 'again', 'only', 'have', 'Sedgewick', 'explain', 'real', 'world', 'where', 'lying', 'cheating', 'unethical', 'are', 'necessary', 'survive.It', 'clash', 'old', 'moral', 'ethic', 'values', 'conquest', 'contribution', 'new', 'moral', 'ethic', 'values', 'regarding', 'conquest', 'contribution.Finally', 'Mr.', 'Hundert', 'Martin', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'actually', '3rd', 'person', 'Mr.', 'Julius', 'Ceasar', 'contest', 'was', 'passed', 'Sedgewick.The', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Hundert', 'again', 'teaching', 'only', 'time', 'have', 'student', 'enter', 'class', 'late', 'time', 'student', 'Martin', 'son', 'who', 'father', 'been', 'raised', 'moral', 'ethical', 'values', 'teachings', 'Mr.', 'Hundert.Overall', 'Emperor', 'Club', 'great', 'movie', 'moral', 'ethics', 'as', 'pointed', 'out', 'several', 'times', 'Mr.', 'Hundert', 'how', 'history', 'will', 'remember', 'Great', 'ambition', 'conquest', 'contribution', 'significance']",N/A
745448,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00008NFR4,A Customer,"[6, 7]","Summary:William Hundert (Kevin Kline) is a Classic's professor at a prestigious all boys academy.  Hundert is well-known for his ability to make his students learn their classical history and is also responsible for the yearly Mr. Julius Caesar contest, which pits his students against each other as they compete to be recognized as the most knowledgeable about ancient Rome and Greece.Everything seems to be going fine until Sedgewick Bell (Emile Hirsch) shows up to class.  Sedgewick's father is a famous Senator (Harris Yulin) who doesn't really care to spend time with his son, but has high expectations and demands.  Hundert and Sedgewick are immediately pitted against one another as Sedgewick's 'class clown' antics disrupt Hundert's teaching style.  Rather than shunning him, most of the students follow him, frustrating Hundert.  Eventually Hundert appeals to Sedgewick's father, along with first shaming then trying to befriend Sedgewick in order to get him to actually start trying in class.Sedgewick, not surprisingly, has the ability but has never had the motivation and ends up as one of the three finalists in the Mr. Julius Caesar competition.  However, Hundert quickly realizes that Sedgewick is cheating, so he poses a question from memory that only a serious student would know.  Sedgewick misses it and his final competitor, Deepak Mehta, Rishi Mehta, answers it correctly, winning the competition.  Despite his anger, Hundert does not expose Sedgewick, mostly at the behest of the headmaster (Edward Herrmann), who knows it will cost the school money as Senator Bell would not be happy.Twenty years later, Sedgewick has invited Hundert and all of his old classmates to a resort that he now owns in order to 'reclaim his intellectual honesty' as he puts it by restaging the Mr. Julius Caesar contest with all of the original contestants.  Hundert, believing Sedgewick has turned over a new leaf, is excited about the affair.  Everything seems to be going great until Hundert realizes that Sedgewick is cheating all over again.  Again, Hundert poses a question that only a serious student, one who happened to be paying attention in class, would get and Sedgewick loses.Again, Hundert does not expose Sedgewick, who, as it turns out, was really just using the whole affair to launch his political campaign following in his father's footsteps as senator.  Hundert, understandably, is furious, especially since he actually fudged the results just a little bit to get Sedgewick into the original competition.  But Hundert does find some satisfaction in that the rest of his students, who are now the elite of American society, seem to really love him and Sedgewick accidentally exposes himself to his son.My Comments:I really thought this movie was just going to be a remake of The Dead Poet's Society and was hesitant to even watch it because the original was so good.  But, as it turns out, the two movies are fairly dissimilar.  Though there is some overlap in that Sedgewick is 'messed up' because of his father (as are most of the boys in Dead Poets), the movie quickly takes a very different turn by introducing Sedgewick as someone that does not care to conform at all.  For a while it seems to mirror Dead Poets when Sedgewick begins to conform, but his cheating reversal throws it off kilter again.  So, if you have been hesitant to see this movie because you had thought it might just be a Dead Poets remake, rest assured, it is sufficiently different to make it worth your while.The story is actually very good.  I was not expecting the first twist and it was fairly convincing.  I can't say it was completely convincing because it probably would have made more sense for Sedgewick to actually try on his own then to blatantly cheat, but the reasoning behind the decision was compelling enough that I was willing to accept it.  But what really made the movie good was the second reversal when Sedgewick cheating again.  I really didn't see this one coming, but it was even more convincing.  Unlike Dead Poets, which romanticizes learning and the ability of a teacher to 'mold' his/her students, this movie explores the idea that some students don't change.  It also illustrates a rather interesting contrast: the ideal world within the ivory tower of education and the 'real' world of politics and business.  In the ivory tower, intellectual honesty is of utmost importance.  In the 'real' world, whatever is required to get the job done is justifiable.  (Of course this is a stereotype, but stereotypes are stereotypes for a reason...)  I liked the story and the issues it addressed.As for the acting, everyone was good except for Emile Hirsch.  Hirsch, though probably directed to do this, came across as over-acting.  His antics to be the class clown were a bit overboard and I didn't really believe the character.  My experience with class clowns is that they are generally more subtle, even the ones who are trying to get kicked out of class.  Anyone, Kline was very good, as was the rest of the cast, it was just the role played by Hirsch that I didn't like.Overall, I would definitely recommend this movie.  It probably wouldn't appeal to a specific group of people, except maybe that select few that was educated in an expensive prep school.  But it is a well-made movie (there are some flaws, but they aren't particularly significant) with a great story and pretty good acting.  If you liked Dead Poets Society, you'll probably find this an interesting contrast.",4,Surprisingly not a remake of Dead Poets Society,1065052800,"10 2, 2003",2003,5498,"['Summary', 'William',

Regardless of what you believe you will come away from this movie with a different opinion.Kevin Kline is Mr. Hundert; a prim and proper Victorian-type teacher in an exclusive boy's school.  He exemplifies integrity and duty, in his day-to-day teachings of the history of the Western world.  His motto is &quot;What will you contribute to the world, for if you don't, you will go down in history as an unknown.&quot;  It is an interesting choice of personal tenets given the story that unfolds.The story is told in several stages.  You see Mr. Hundert returning to some sort of reunion 25 years later. Then you jump back to the incident that spawned this reunion.The school he works at gains the son of a Senator, a boy who is as unruly as they come.  However, his mischief shows promise of a brilliant mind and Mr. Hundert is bound to shape the young man's character.  So much so, that in his disappointment with this boy's behavior, he seeks out his father; the senator, to take task with the boy.  Mr. Hundert came away from that discussion, less than satisfied but two things came from this.  1. The senator, when told, the teacher was trying to mold his son, retorted that it was his job to do that.  2. The boy when chastised by his father, started buckling down.Soon this senator's son is showing progress, so much so he nearly qualifies for a contest.The school highlights a contest, a battle of wits, that first eliminates all but three competitors.  They are competing in their knowledge of the History of the Western world.  It all winds up to 3 competitors and a question and answer session that eliminates all but the final winner of the Julius Ceasar award. The teacher's decision in regards to this contest will haunt him for the rest of his life.The contest produces some surprises and Mr. Hundert also learns more about the world he lives in, in the process of this as well.The acting was excellent.

Well, possibly because the son of Senator Bell is not the sort of kid I wanted him to be after being taught by a really good teacher. One that is as interested in the character of his students every bit as much as the facts they can memorize. Or maybe because much of the classroom work centers around facts to memorize. It's history, so part of that is dates. And it's classical Greek and Roman history, which is how the title came about: the Emperor in the name is Caesar (of which there were several, of course).The snooty prep school has a tradition of a contest in greco-roman history which awards the prize title of Emperor Caesar to the winner.

Against the request of the Senator `not to mold Sedgewick's character,' Hundert becomes obsessed to the point of compromising his own values, and excluding some of his other students.What will become of Sedgewick?  Will he win the coveted Mr. Julius Caesar Award, marking him as the most distinguished student of his school in ancient Roman history?  More importantly, will Mr. Hundert make an impact on the young man's life?""The Emperor's Club"" is a good movie containing some interesting twists and turns, starting slowly, yet finishing strong.

Middleton,"[1, 1]","After watching this subtle and well-made film, one cannot help but make comparisons to other films about teachers and their profound though sometimes underrated influence they have on their students. One of the more famous of this genre is the British film, staring Peter O'Tool, adapted from the novel, Good Bye Mr. Chips. The more recent American film, Mr. Holland's Opus, was a wonderful film, though a touch too sentimental for my tastes. Another early American film, and virtually a forgotten one was Good Morning Miss Dove, that had a deep effect on me as a child as she was depicted as a pillar of strength and virtue, which, over the forty years of her long tenure, contributed to shaping the character of an entire small town. Dead Poets Society, another prep school situation, was perfect for its time, and a defining moment for comedic actor, Robin Williams, who showed his audience he could actually do a dramatic role, and do it quite well. The general theme from all these films is the positive influence teachers can have on our lives. We change for the better because of their influence and the little things they show us about life. However this film approaches this genre from a different perspective. Can one wrong ethical choice about a student, from the teacher's perspective, affect the outcome and long-term character of that student?It is difficult to describe some of the details of plot without spoiling the entire movie. Let's just say that Kevin Kline's character, a history teacher in a privileged private school, believes that teaching is not merely passing on `facts', but about moulding character, making boy's into virtuous adults. Because of his enthusiasm over the `turn around' of a particularly troubled student, wanting him to succeed, as most good teachers want us to do, he violates his own integrity, simply turning a grade from an A minus to an A plus, which could well have altered the fate of this individual student. Later in the film, upon discovering an unethical situation, because of politics and its `complications', does not, in my mind, do the right thing. The ending of this film is surprising as we expect circumstances to turn out differently. But there is a message, and a good one.Kevin Kline was perfect in the role as the teacher and seems to have a natural sense about what real teachers are all about. I believe this because he reminds me of an old teacher I once had in high school who had a big affect on my views about history, books and learning in general.The Emperor's Club is a excellent film about teaching, character and what it means to have integrity.

Sanderman,"[2, 2]","Everything that reviewers have said about this film is true: THE EMPEROR'S CLUB manages to rise above what could have been a stale, well-trodden plot to achieve real emotional sincerity.  It manages to achieve this through the high quality of the acting performances contained in this film, most notably that of Kevin Kline, who plays a schoolteacher determined to teach his students more than just a history lesson.  Kline's performance is human and moving at several points, especially for anyone who has ever dedicated their lives to teaching (or been touched by someone who has).There are some weaknesses.  For starters, the film never makes up its mind about who to focus on: the young boys or their inspiring teacher.  It does not choose to view life solely through the eyes of the students (such as DEAD POETS SOCIETY), nor does it choose to view the world primarily through the eyes of the teacher (like STAND AND DELIVER).  Instead, it tries to accomplish both perspectives.  While this leads to an interesting dynamic in the film, it also does not seem to leave sufficient time to develop either one of these viewpoints adequately.  Secondly, THE EMPEROR'S CLUB does not quite seem to know when it should end, dragging on the film's conclusion for an extra twenty minutes.Despite these shortcomings, and its obvious comparisons to DEAD POETS SOCIETY, THE EMPEROR'S CLUB is a good film in its own right and deserves to be viewed apart from its inevitable twin.  One does wonder, however, why the film's producers decided to give the film a name with such obvious lines of comparison: what is a ""club"" but a type of ""society,"" and the terms ""poet"" and ""emperor"" merely serve to demarcate the academic subjects each film focuses upon.

But in addition to that I saw another spin on the conflict between two very old platitudes: ""The Squeaky Wheel Gets the Grease"" and ""Still Waters Run Deep"".Here we have the charming wiseguy troublemaker of a student (Sedgewick) who commands the attention of everyone in the classroom, including the professor who feels he has a responsibility to shape the character of his students. And at what cost? The bright but mousy student (Martin) is sacrificed in the process. How sad, and yet how often this takes place in our everyday lives. In fact, it's so pervasive that we hardly notice it. Face it, to be human is to be flawed; but one of humanity's biggest faux pas, despite some lip service to the contrary, is that we're essentially shallow and superficial. Pack animals who are suckers for glamor and manipulation. We need to work on that one.This is not to condemn the teacher (Mr. Hundert), however.  He did what he thought was for the best at the time, only to struggle with ethical dilemmas of his own as well as regrets as time went on.

My high school was unfortunately full of teachers who didn't give half a goddamn about you. And it was/is one of the most respected (read pretentious) in the country. I never learned one single thing that was actually of use to me and I believe going to such a place is mostly responsible for turning me into the faithless cynic that I am now.In this movie Kevin Kline (a seriously underused actor) plays a history teacher who is dedicated to making sure his students grow up to be fine and morally sound, upstanding people. They all get along until Sedgewick Bell (Emile Hirsh)the hell-raising son of an arrogant Governor arrives in class. His grades are terrible but Mr. Hundert sees intelligence in the boy and struggles to push him in the right direction at the expense of the rest of the class who actually want and care for education.

But he is flawed. Kevin Kline is so good in the role that for most of the film I thought I was watching a real person and not a character. And doesn't he sound like Niles from Frasier?I do wish I went to somewhere like St. Benedicts or at least had a teacher like Mr. Hundert. It seems that teachers who really care only exist in the movies As are students who are willing to learn. Or perhaps it's just my bad non-education that skews my opinion.

745471,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00008NFR4,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 1]","There cannot be any remake of the ""Dead Poets Society"". There cannot be any remake of ""The Changing of the Guard"" from the Twilight Zone. So why try? And this film is a remake of the two I have just quoted and maybe a few more. The only new element is to introduce in that elite Ivy League prep school a cheater as the main central student character. Nothing new really either, I mean cheating in those institutions is part of the job, part of the fun, part of the game and to be taken is not only a risk it is a pleasure. So, what can make this film worth making first and worth seeing second? Not much but one thing though. The fact that the teacher, the real main character, actually cheats to help a cheater access the competition he does not deserve accessing and the teacher discovers only after the competition that the chap was a cheater, which he did not know before. He confronts him in their mutual disappointment, mutual and reciprocal. But not disappointed entirely for the same reasons. The teacher because he cheated in the grading, hence he cheated another student who probably deserved the reward better than the recipient of the cheated grade. The cheater because he could not go through and lost anyway. But there is worse than that after all. The teacher realizes the student is cheating before the end of the competition and he tells the school's principal discretely and that one tells him to forget about it, to ignore it, which he does not do entirely, though he does it for everyone who is watching and is unaware of the cheating. He just changes the questions and looks for one that is not purely factual but that requires some wider knowledge and he fails the cheater like that. But the film is vicious somewhere because twenty-five years later or so, the same student, now grown up, married and the father of two sons, requires a repeat of the competition with a full class reunion in order to provide the school with a great grant to build a new library dedicated to his own dead father. But he wants the teacher to be there and preside on the ceremony. And it is a full repeat and we know from the very start it is going to be using modern technology of course. So, the interest is about the attitude of the teacher when he realizes he is being cheated, and how is he going to react in order to fail the cheater, and how is he going to confront him with the truth? That you will have to find out by yourselves. The punishment will be harsh on the teacher who will have to come to terms with his conscience about cheating on the grading, cheating one student in favor of another one, come to terms and make amends. The punishment will be even harsher for the cheater who will be confronted to no public scandal, he who wants to be a senator, but to a private and lasting knowledge that will run in his family for generations and will always classify him as a cheater, and no matter what he may say and think, that stain is hard to remove and to forget. But the subsequent real ending is sentimental and has little interest. In fact it is a double ending which makes it even more sentimental. The question that floats on top of all that is why? Why did the teacher not give the proper grade to that student who was going to reveal himself as being a cheater? Is it because that student was rowdy and difficult, because he had insinuated that he, the teacher, liked little boys, or because his father had told the teacher that he had to do his job, i.e. teaching, and not meddle with molding the child? Probably a little of the three: to prove he could bring the child on the right track, to prove to himself he was not hurt by the sexual insinuation and to prove to himself he could mold the child even without the agreement of his senator of a father. And he failed them all: the child was a cheater and not a success, he did not prove anything to anyone about his sexuality that remained unsatisfactory and totally clandestine, no matter what it may have been, and he did not mold the student since that student would do it again twenty five years later in front of his own wife and children. A complete failure. Maybe not quite a complete failure thanks to the two sentimental endings, but that is pure compensation, no real success. For the details get the film and watch it. You cannot foresee the second and last ending at all.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",4,Never should a teacher cheat with the grades,1233964800,"02 7, 2009",2009,4497,"['can', 'not', 'be', 'remake', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'remake', 'Changing', 'Guard', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'So', 'why', 'try', 'film', 'remake', 'two', 'have', 'just', 'quoted', 'maybe', 'few', 'more', 'only', 'new', 'element', 'introduce', 'elite', 'Ivy', 'League', 'prep', 'school', 'cheater', 'main', 'central', 'student', 'character', 'Nothing', 'new', 'really', 'mean', 'cheating', 'institutions', 'part', 'job', 'part', 'fun', 'part', 'game', 'be', 'taken', 'not', 'only', 'risk', 'pleasure', 'So', 'what', 'can', 'make', 'film', 'making', 'first', 'worth', 'seeing', 'second', 'Not', 'much', 'one', 'thing', 'fact', 'teacher', 'real', 'main', 'character', 'actually', 'help', 'cheater', 'access', 'competition', 'not', 'deserve', 'accessing', 'teacher', 'only', 'competition', 'chap', 'was', 'cheater', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'before', 'mutual', 'disappointment', 'mutual', 'reciprocal', 'not', 'disappointed', 'entirely', 'same', 'reasons', 'teacher', 'cheated', 'grading', 'hence', 'cheated', 'student', 'who', 'probably', 'deserved', 'reward', 'better', 'recipient', 'cheated', 'grade', 'cheater', 'could', 'not', 'go', 'lost', 'anyway', 'worse', 'teacher', 'student', 'cheating', 'end', 'competition', 'school', 'principal', 'discretely', 'one', 'forget', 'ignore', 'not', 'do', 'entirely', 'everyone', 'who', 'watching', 'unaware', 'cheating', 'just', 'questions', 'one', 'not', 'purely', 'factual', 'wider', 'knowledge', 'cheater', 'film', 'vicious', 'somewhere', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'later', 'so', 'same', 'student', 'now', 'up', 'married', 'father', 'two', 'sons', 'repeat', 'competition', 'full', 'class', 'reunion', 'order', 'provide', 'school', 'great', 'grant', 'build', 'new', 'library', 'dedicated', 'own', 'dead', 'father', 'teacher', 'be', 'there', 'preside', 'ceremony', 'full', 'repeat', 'know', 'very', 'start', 'going', 'be', 'using', 'modern', 'technology', 'course', 'So', 'interest', 'attitude', 'teacher', 'when', 'being', 'cheated', 'how', 'going', 'react', 'order', 'fail', 'cheater', 'how', 'going', 'confront', 'truth', 'will', 'have', 'find', 'out', 'yourselves', 'punishment', 'will', 'be', 'harsh', 'teacher', 'who', 'will', 'have', 'come', 'terms', 'conscience', 'cheating', 'grading', 'cheating', 'one', 'student', 'favor', 'one', 'come', 'terms', 'make', 'amends', 'punishment', 'will', 'be', 'even', 'harsher', 'cheater', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'confronted', 'public', 'scandal', 'who', 'be', 'senator', 'private', 'lasting', 'knowledge', 'will', 'run', 'family', 'generations', 'will', 'always', 'classify', 'cheater', 'matter', 'what', 'may', 'say', 'think', 'stain', 'hard', 'remove', 'forget', 'subsequent', 'real', 'ending', 'sentimental', 'little', 'interest', 'fact', 'double', 'ending', 'even', 'more', 'sentimental', 'question', 'top', 'why', 'Why', 'did', 'teacher', 'not', 'give', 'proper', 'grade', 'student', 'who', 'was', 'going', 'reveal', 'being', 'cheater', 'student', 'was', 'rowdy', 'difficult', 'had', 'insinuated', 'teacher', 'liked', 'little', 'boys', 'father', 'had', 'told', 'teacher', 'had', 'do', 'job', 'i.e', 'teaching', 'not', 'meddle', 'molding', 'child', 'Probably', 'little', 'three', 'prove', 'could', 'bring', 'child', 'right', 'track', 'prove', 'was', 'not', 'hurt', 'sexual', 'insinuation', 'prove', 'could', 'mold', 'child', 'even', 'agreement', 'senator', 'father', 'failed', 'child', 'was', 'cheater', 'not', 'success', 'did', 'not', 'prove', 'anything', 'anyone', 'sexuality', 'remained', 'unsatisfactory', 'totally', 'clandestine', 'matter', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'did', 'not', 'mold', 'student', 'student', 'would', 'do', 'again', 'twenty', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'front', 'own', 'wife', 'children', 'complete', 'failure', 'Maybe', 'not', 'quite', 'complete', 'failure', 'thanks', 'two', 'sentimental', 'endings', 'pure', 'compensation', 'real', 'success', 'details', 'get', 'film', 'watch', 'can', 'not', 'foresee', 'second', 'last', 'ending', 'all.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",N/A
745472,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B00008NFR4,James Hiller,"[1, 1]","For many reasons, I tend to avoid movies that deal with education or teaching. Aside from a few treasures (Dead Poet's Society), most of them miss the mark of the duty and honor involved with education. They suggest that kids eagerly await with witty retorts on the end of their tongues, or that total strangers can walk off the street and become a successful teacher overnight.However, this trend has been bucked with the inspirational movie, ""Emperor's Club"". Kevin Kline plays an intellectual Western Civilization teacher Mr. Hundert. Immediately, comparisons will be made with the aforementioned movie ""Dead Poet's Society"", but comparisons are inherently unfair. They are two entire different creatures, with different stories, so leave those comparisons behind.Mr. Hundert lives in the realm of his mind, in ideas, and his ability to impart those ideas to the youth in his care is impressive. Taking a subject many of us would cringe to study, Roman history, Hundert makes it sparkle and come alive. Then we meet his nemesis in the form of 16 year old Sedgewick Bell.Bell, son of a senator, rebellious teen with reasons, challenges Hundert in class and out as he's never had before. By roping in his fellow classmates, he stages a small coup against the school and leadership of Mr. Hundert himself. Hundert, unhindered, uses his wise wit to battle this arrogant kid, to challenge him to participate in a school competition. Intrigued, Bell undertakes the challenge.That's how the movie starts, but the story begins to unfold in more complex way. What this movie ultimately becomes is a story of people who make choices in their lives, and their ability or inability to live with those choices. That's what lifts this movie up from your run-of-the-average inspirational teacher movie. The themes run deep, very deep, and make for a compelling time at the theater.I highly recommend ""Emperor's Club"".

He questions his actions and is eventually given a chance to redeem both himself and the student.This movie can seem quite boring, but it captured my interest in a mild degree.

There are several places I noticed subtleties this time around which made me wonder about his relationship with his father - seeing even more clearly how it may have mirrored Sedgewick Bell's relationship with his Senator father.The opening segment is one I will watch over and over and over and over.

745480,A3160YSU1KRL8E,B00008NFR4,Justin Playfair,"[4, 4]","This excellent movie about education in a private prepratory academy centers on the period of the mid 1970's, when the value of a classical education based on a knowledge of Greek, Latin, Literature, Philosophy, History, Mathematics and Religion was coming into question and eventually were surrendered to our modern day cirriculum. This movie is a reflection of a nostalgic past when educators were confident that a true gentlemen could not be moulded without these essentials. The main character, a History teacher, strongly believes in honesty and is dedicated to the classics only to end up feeling betrayed and shaken when he is countered by characters whose only concern is worldly power and money. He proves just how out of touch he is with the world when he visits a Politician in an attempt to motivate his son who he is having trouble with at school. The politician brushes off his objections and essentially tells him the limits of his authority over his son. He is further shocked when he discovers the son cheating in a contest and informs the principal, who tells him to ignore it. Not ready to stand against his beliefs, he goes off the cards and asks a question that he realizes the son can't possibly know in order to end the contest. In the end, Mr. Hundert's rigid dedication to honesty is somewhat hypocritical, because the mission to motivate the politician's son was at the expense of someone else!The dictum centers around how one ""little sin"" causes a tidal wave of destruction in the future, as he is first, rejected to be the headmaster at the academy in favor of another younger man who he went out of his way to get hired in the 70's, then called to re-enact the contest again, as the now adult son of the politician promises an endowment if Hundert will participate to ""restore his honor"". He agrees but fails to see that the son is an image of his father in all respects, and only uses people for greater selfish objectives. In the re-enactment of the contest, Hundert once again realizes that the son is cheating and goes off the cards to ask a question that he can't possibly answer. Standing up for ""what is right"" , taking the high moral ground. It is then he must face his ""little sin"" and confess to the student that he denied a place for the sake of the rotten/selfish politician's son. After confession and a realization of the limits that one can't make everyone see the light, he returns to the old academy as a new man, refreshed and willing to just do what he is best at under a new set of pupils of every race, sex and creed in the modern era of the 90's.

Certainly not because the two are particularly similar. Rather, because ""they"" (the guys in suits) asked for it in no uncertain terms. So, here are their just desserts:The first time this film reentered my mind after its forgettable theatrical run was when I read Roger Ebert's appalling review of ""Dead Poets Society"" after staring aghast at the title among those in ""I hated hated hated this movie."" (Ebert gave ""Emperors"" an extra star at the least.)The second time this film came to mind was when I read a glowing review of it by a friend of mine who asserts it deserves to be judged ""apart from its 'inevitable twin' To him I say that there is such a thing as an evil twin.Much has been made of Mr. Hundert's fudging of a test result in order to give a troubled kid with a soul-crushing father a chance at glory. I didn't condemn Mr. Hundert for this at all, even though the movie did make the right choice and show the unfortunate consequences to the other contender.I felt that this choice was made on the grounds that Mr. Hundert sincerely believed the other student needed it more.Giving a kid who seemed to have made a genuine transformation a chance at recognition in the hopes he will continue on the right path is one thing, allowing cheaters to prosper is quite another. I believe Mr. Keating of ""Dead Poets Society"" would have fallen on the sword and set things right. He would not have bowed to pressure. He would expose the wrong-doer AND HIS OWN MISTAKE.That is why I hated ""Emperor's Club."" Not because there were no Robin Williamsian antics and no one was asked to ""yalp."" Rather, I hated it because Hundert is totally unworthy of the adulation afforded him. Keating was ousted for an incident that was clearly not his fault, and took his fate with grace.

745488,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00008NFR4,Lawyeraau,"[2, 2]","This is a gem of a film with a beautifully nuanced performance by Kevin Kline. When I saw this film in the video store, its descriptive blurb brought to mind films such as &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot;, &quot;The Dead Poet's Society&quot;, and even &quot;Mr. Holland's Opus&quot;.  So, I thought it would be a pleasant, sentimental film. Well, it turns out that this film delivers much more than sentimentality, as its themes are far more complex. It is simply a wonderful film with stellar performances by the entire cast.Kevin Kline is superlative in the role of Mr. William Hundert, the assistant headmaster at St. Benedict's Academy, where he is also the  history teacher, focusing on the ancient Greeks and Romans. St. Benedict's Academy is a tony, old world boarding school, steeped in tradition and proud of its high academic standards. Through the teaching of the classics, Mr. Hundert strives to instill in his motivated students old fashioned values, such as leadership,  honor, integrity, and ethics. He himself tries to live his life by those values.This cloistered, comfortable world of his, however, is torn asunder, with the entry of a new student, Sedgewick Bell (Emile Hirsch), the charismatic, troubled son of a U.S. Senator. Unmotivated and mischievous, he enters Mr. Hundert's  life and ends up tearing it apart. Mr. Hundert sees that Sedgewick is innately intelligent, though an under-achiever. He also realizes that Sedgewick has some issues with his influential father that account for his poor attitude. Seeing that Sedgewick has natural leadership ability, Mr. Hundert decides to try to mold him for the common good. His earnest efforts in trying to put the  morally bankrupt Sedgewick on the straight and narrow, however, end up compromising Mr. Hundert's own cherished values. It also gives him a rude awakening. Therein lies the tale.While much of what occurs in the film holds little surprise, it has some intriguing twists and turns that make it a morally complex and multi-faceted film. It is a film with a  message that is particularly applicable in today's win-at-all-costs world, where situational ethics seems to be a by product of the prevailing dog-eat-dog standard. The film reminds the viewer that strength of character does not necessarily exempt one from falling prey to the new ethics promulgated by today's society. Nor are strength of character, goodness, and selfless leadership always rewarded. Sometimes it is passed over for the shallow, showy, and  self-promoting. Life is, simply put, not always fair nor does the end always justify the means.The film is beautifully directed by Michael Hoffman, who displays a deft touch, avoiding mawkishness, and opting, instead, for a more realistic treatment. Kevin Kline is masterful as the highly principled schoolmaster who finds himself ethically compromised and makes a choice that will ripple twenty five years into the future. His portrayal of Mr. Hundert is that of an idealistic human being who is flawed, a man who, when beset by moral dilemmas, does not always make the right choices. Yet, he is a man who is able to come to terms with those choices as his motivations remain true to his ideals.  Emile Hirsch is excellent as the troubled Sedgewick, giving the viewer a peak at the man he is eventually to become. Rob Morrow has a small role as James Ellerby, an ambitious colleague of Mr. Hundert's who has his eye on the prize. Mr. Morrow shines in this small, but important role, as it is a role that runs counterpoint to Kevin Kline's role. While all the loose ends are not firmly tied up at the end of this film, this was a wise choice, as life is not always tidy.This is a superb film well worth having in one's personal collection.

HOLLAND'S OPUS, and nostalgic TV shows like ""The Young Americans"", though Michael Hoffman's classroom drama is distinguished by the breadth of its thematic ambition. Essentially an exploration of the clash of values within modern society - with Kline's honorable English professor set against the corrupted moral uncertainties of a particularly difficult student (played as a boy by newcomer Hirsch) - the production is a class-act all the way, beautifully designed by Patrizia von Brandenstein (AMADEUS), and photographed with exquisite grace by Lajos Koltai (THE LEGEND OF 1900).But Neil Tolkin's script tries so hard to avoid the 'pitfalls' of sentimentality that it ultimately fails to generate any real emotion at all. In fact, the film's climactic sequence serves only to remind us that virtue and honor will always be challenged by darker influences, and that Evil has an immovable foothold within the world. Crafted with loving attention to detail, and performed with real conviction by a sterling cast, this is one of the few occasions in recent memory when a Hollywood movie's refusal to conform to 'formula' undermines a wealth of good intentions.

745491,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00008NFR4,Martin Asiner,"[3, 3]","Some of the best known inspirational teacher movies--DEAD POET'S SOCIETY, GOODBYE MR. CHIPS, TO SIR WITH LOVE--all portray the hero as a teacher with an unswerving moral vision.  These teachers not only inspired, but had to overcome the usual host of student impediments to learn.  In THE EMPEROR'S CLUB, director William Hoffman gives us Kevin Kline as Professor Hundert, an imposing teacher of Roman and Greek history at the mythical St. Benedict's Preparatory School for Boys.  Unlike the three other celluloid teachers, Kline's Hundert is more of a real world teacher in that he is faced with choices that these real world teachers have to do, namely that the difference between right and wrong and between ethical and unethical is not black and white.  In Hundert's tidy world of Assistant Headmaster and teacher of Western Civilization, he sees a tendency to view the inevitability of historical cause and effect as a prelude to see human relations in the same way.Sedgewick Bell is the new student in his class.  Bell is willful, lazy, disobedient, and prone to cheating.  However, Hundert sees Bell as a project that tests his own ability to reach out and do more than teach history or values for that matter.  In a meeting with Bell's father, a pushy and abrasive U. S. Senator, Hundert is told that his job is to teach, not to mold minds.  This warning by the elder Mr. Bell is a foreshadowing that Hundert will spend the remainder of the movie in molding, rather than teaching, Sedgewick.  Hundert tries every method of exhortation that he knows, and in a crucial student competition of history, Hundert faces the queasy choice of eliminating Sedgewick based only on his merit, or rewarding him by unfairly placing him in the final round of three.  Hundert decides to place Sedgewick as a finalist, thereby depriving another of his rightfully earned place.  Hundert's choice, though morally questionable, is one that many teachers face on a daily basis.  Director Hoffman does not allow Kline to either validate or reject his choice.  Instead, what Kline does is to balance a host of factors in his attempt to reach out to a troubled boy who has clearly suffered at the hands of a nasty and brutal martinet of a father.  There is no right or wrong, since the result of Hundert's tinkering with ethics might have worked in turning around the life of a boy who is on track that threatens to turn him into the newest reincarnation of his father.Kline's performance as Hundert is emotionally wrenching, if not satisfying.  Kline is massively dignified and is aware that his own morality must impact on his students.  Other movie teachers, by comparison, are seen as rigidly benevolent.  Can you imagine Robin Williams or Sidney Poitier as cheating to help a recalcitrant student?  The success or failure of Hundert to make a lasting impact on a morally deficient student is seen as less important than the recognition that the worth of one such as Sedgewick Bell cannot be measured by the completion of one act of heroism or dastardliness.  THE EMPEROR'S CLUB suggests that people are more complex than the results of one of their acts. Hundert learns this, even if his students do not.",5,The Worth of a Man is Not Measured Only by One Act,1060905600,"08 15, 2003",2003,3193,"['best', 'known', 'inspirational', 'teacher', 'movies', 'DEAD', 'POET', 'SOCIETY', 'GOODBYE', 'MR.', 'CHIPS', 'TO', 'SIR', 'WITH', 'LOVE', 'portray', 'hero', 'teacher', 'unswerving', 'moral', 'vision', 'teachers', 'not', 'only', 'inspired', 'had', 'overcome', 'usual', 'host', 'student', 'impediments', 'learn', 'THE', 'EMPEROR', 'CLUB', 'director', 'William', 'Hoffman', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Professor', 'Hundert', 'imposing', 'teacher', 'Roman', 'Greek', 'history', 'mythical', 'St.', 'Benedict', 'Preparatory', 'School', 'Boys', 'three', 'other', 'celluloid', 'teachers', 'Kline', 'Hundert', 'more', 'real', 'world', 'teacher', 'faced', 'choices', 'real', 'world', 'teachers', 'have', 'do', 'namely', 'difference', 'right', 'wrong', 'ethical', 'unethical', 'not', 'black', 'white', 'Hundert', 'tidy', 'world', 'Assistant', 'Headmaster', 'teacher', 'Western', 'Civilization', 'tendency', 'view', 'inevitability', 'historical', 'cause', 'effect', 'prelude', 'see', 'human', 'relations', 'same', 'way.Sedgewick', 'Bell', 'new', 'student', 'class', 'Bell', 'willful', 'lazy', 'disobedient', 'prone', 'cheating', 'However', 'Hundert', 'Bell', 'project', 'own', 'ability', 'reach', 'out', 'do', 'more', 'teach', 'history', 'values', 'matter', 'meeting', 'Bell', 'father', 'pushy', 'abrasive', 'U.', 'S.', 'Senator', 'Hundert', 'told', 'job', 'teach', 'not', 'mold', 'minds', 'warning', 'elder', 'Mr.', 'Bell', 'foreshadowing', 'Hundert', 'will', 'spend', 'remainder', 'movie', 'molding', 'rather', 'teaching', 'Sedgewick', 'Hundert', 'method', 'exhortation', 'crucial', 'student', 'competition', 'history', 'Hundert', 'queasy', 'choice', 'eliminating', 'Sedgewick', 'based', 'only', 'merit', 'rewarding', 'unfairly', 'placing', 'final', 'round', 'three', 'Hundert', 'place', 'Sedgewick', 'finalist', 'thereby', 'depriving', 'rightfully', 'earned', 'place', 'Hundert', 'choice', 'morally', 'questionable', 'one', 'many', 'teachers', 'face', 'daily', 'basis', 'Director', 'Hoffman', 'not', 'allow', 'Kline', 'either', 'validate', 'reject', 'choice', 'Instead', 'what', 'Kline', 'balance', 'host', 'factors', 'attempt', 'reach', 'out', 'troubled', 'boy', 'who', 'clearly', 'suffered', 'hands', 'nasty', 'brutal', 'martinet', 'father', 'right', 'wrong', 'result', 'Hundert', 'tinkering', 'ethics', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'turning', 'around', 'life', 'boy', 'who', 'track', 'turn', 'newest', 'reincarnation', 'father.Kline', 'performance', 'Hundert', 'emotionally', 'wrenching', 'not', 'satisfying', 'Kline', 'massively', 'dignified', 'aware', 'own', 'morality', 'must', 'impact', 'students', 'Other', 'movie', 'teachers', 'comparison', 'are', 'seen', 'rigidly', 'benevolent', 'Can', 'imagine', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'cheating', 'help', 'recalcitrant', 'student', 'success', 'failure', 'Hundert', 'make', 'lasting', 'impact', 'morally', 'deficient', 'student', 'seen', 'less', 'important', 'recognition', 'worth', 'one', 'such', 'Sedgewick', 'Bell', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'measured', 'completion', 'one', 'act', 'heroism', 'dastardliness', 'EMPEROR', 'CLUB', 'people', 'are', 'more', 'complex', 'results', 'one', 'acts', 'Hundert', 'even', 'students', 'do', 'not']",N/A

I was worried that it was going to try to be another &quot;Dead Poets Society.&quot;  To my surprise, it isn't.  In fact, I'll even go further and say that I thought this was a lot better.  &quot;The Emperor's Club&quot; is a powerful and gripping drama about principle, virtue and ethical compromises.The story revolves around a teacher, William Hundert.  He's a passionate man who loves what he does and hopes that he is actually having an impact on his students with his teachings.  Things get complicated when he meets a new student, Sedgewick Bell.  The kid is a troublemaker who cries out for attention with his actions.  However, Hundert is convinced that he can turn him around and help him learn something from his class; not only that, but he hopes that he can learn something about life itself.  Hundert believes in him so much that he is even willing to make a great compromise that will have an absolute impact in some way, whether it be positive or negative.  The results are surprising and unexpected, but the overall product is an outstanding movie that makes you think twice about your life.This was really a great film that had me surprised all the way.  I had no idea how deep and effective it would end up being.  When you see &quot;The Emperor's Club,&quot; it actually makes you want to look at your life right then and there.  You realize that you do want to live a life of honor, virtue and principle.  We tend to live in a society that forgets about these important qualities sometimes; this being dubbed, &quot;The Real World.&quot;  However, this does not mean that we have to forget or overlook these things.  It is possible to still have virtue in one's life.Everything about this movie is remarkable.  It has some great acting, a terrific script, and a genuine and authentic direction.  Kevin Klein is amazing as William Hundert.  It's a crime that he did not receive an Academy Award for his performance in this underrated film; or at least he should've been nominated for one.  He is able to portray a great and wonderful character; also, he is able to play a character with realistic flaws that reminds us that he is a human-being.  This is something we rarely see in films; as we are always given the impression that teachers are invincible and flawless when they are usually portrayed in films.The DVD has some nice extra features to go along with it.  The picture and sound quality is great.  You can even watch it in DTS if you have the right system for it.  The special features included are deleted scenes, commentary from the director, a making-of special and more.  A pretty nice package, if you ask me.&quot;The Emperor's Club&quot; is a wonderful experience that should be enjoyed by all.

How will history remember you??As we draw ever closer to the first day of summer, high school seniors across the country, quite possibly even the world, will be reminiscing upon their four year high school careers wondering what impact it, as well as the numerous individuals involved, has had on them and the people they hope to become in the not-too-distant future. Though many don?t see it now, there will be a time when they will hearken back to their freshmen Latin I or junior U.S. History classes and wonder whether the decisions they made in those times had the lasting contributable factors that their teachers had hoped they would have on their students. No one can call themselves a valuable educator unless they are willing to do what ever possible to make their students? futures all the more fulfilling by focusing on the people they will become rather then their ability to pass. If that is not the case amongst many educators today then they are no better then most of the present MPS teachers in that they are only setting their students up for continued failure. There must be more to it then that.The story centers on a teacher who, at a fork in the road of his life, worries that his thirty-four year teaching career may have been worthless as he may have had little impact on the students he had hoped to enlighten in that time period. The film begins with a narration by Arthur Hundert, a Classics professor who has taught at the elite St. Benedict?s prep school for over thirty years, exclaiming, ?A man?s character is his fate? and questioning if his teaching career lived up to the values he had set for his students. In his mind he travels back to the early 1970s at a time that would prove the most challenging of his entire teaching career, all in part to one student named Sedgewick Bell. Sedgewick is the incompliant and pigheaded son of a Louisiana senator who cares more about his son?s ability to pass to graduation rather then the impact this prep school may have on the man he will turn out to be in the real world. After seeing a connection between Sedgewick and himself, both the products of busy and often absent fathers, Hundert takes it upon himself to rear the stubborn child by doing everything possible to fully prepare him for the Mr. Julius Caesar Contest, a test of ancient history and classic literature knowledge in which the winner will be declared Mr. Julius Caesar, the most prestigious honor St. Benedict?s can bestow on a student. But when Hundert discovers that Sedgewick cheated during the contest, his teaching career goes into precipitated tailspin which leads back to the present where he has been invited by the now grown up Sedgewick Bell for a rematch of the Mr. Julius Caesar Contest in order to reclaim his intellectual honor. When, once again, Bell fails to put real invest in the contest and cheats, Hundert now questions whether he contributed anything at all to the students he had so much ambition for. The story for The Emperor?s Club is a entertaining drama for a rainy-day afternoon but disappoints in the fact that it demonstrates nothing that hasn?t been done before in films like Goodbye Mr. Chips and Mr. Holland?s Opus. What makes this vastly inferior to Dead Poet?s Society is that it spends too much time focusing on the teacher rather then the singular students of his class and how his teaching has impacted them as individuals and the choices they make in life as a result. The story also lacks the emotional depth that made Dead Poet?s all the more enduring and thought provoking.When it comes to famous, or even recognizable, performers, this film has few to offer but it doesn?t seem to matter as much with Kevin Kline?s performance alone making up for the lack of distinguishable talent. Kline works the character of Arthur Hundert perfectly and never seems too lax in any scene that he is present in. And his work opposite Emile Hirsch, who plays Sedgewick Bell, showcases tremendous effort especially in lines that are suppose to have immense impact on events later on the film, such as, ?Aristophanes once wrote, roughly translated; ?Youth ages, immaturity is outgrown, ignorance can be educated, and drunkenness sobered, but STUPID lasts forever.?? But Kline?s performance, as laudable as it may be, doesn?t save the character entirely as certain actions as well as characters that surrounds him. As is seen often in Shakespeare plays like Hamlet and Julius Caesar, which is slightly touched on within the film, the lead character has the opportunity to set things right, in this case revealing Sedgewick as a cheater, but fails to do so and, as a result, causes further damage then if he had just done something earlier on. What makes this situation even worse with Mr. Hundert is that he is given the opportunity twice and still refuses to do anything. Although money is often involved in these situations, nothing should come before a man and the principles he stands for. For a man who talks so much about virtues and principals, Hundert hardly follows up on what he preaches.Overall, The Emperor?s Club, as ambitious and well-intentioned as it tries to be, delivers on Hundert?s opening statement on being ?a story without surprises? and results in nothing more then a regurgitation of all the teacher/coming of age dramas that have been done to death in the past. In the end, despite the hard intentions of the filmmakers to wrap things up in an appropriate manner, the emphasis on the film?s story is lost and the audience is left thinking, ?So what?? The main problem is that there is no emotional connection with any character, including Mr. Hundert, to really drive home the point that the filmmakers present at the end of this film. They spend so much time focusing on the solitary conflicts between Mr. Hundert and Sedgewick Bell that, in a way, they contradict themselves in the statement, ?The worth of a life is not determined by a single failure or a solitary success?. Had they followed up on that line, it would have resulted in a look into all the lives of the students rather then a specific individual. Although that too would have been nothing different from Dead Poet?s Society, it is admirable for a film to be bland and predictable then to contradict itself on the message it tries to express. That is not to say that The Emperor?s Club is not entertaining, Kline?s performance and James Newton Howard?s memorable musical score prevent it from being a total wash, but film expresses thoughts on a subject matter that has been done numerous times in the past without divulging on anything new or thought provoking.",3,"The Moose Hole - Dead 'Emperor's' Society ...

745496,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00008NFR4,mirasreviews,"[2, 2]","William Hundert (Kevin Kline) has been a professor of Ancient Civilizations for 34 years. One year, while teaching at St. Benedict's Academy for Young Men, he had a rebellious and obstinate student named Sedgewick Bell (Emile Hirsch). Believing that the lessons of history have great value and that the character of ancient leaders can be an inspiration to the youth of today, Prof. Hundert commits himself to nurturing and encouraging the young Mr. Bell in hopes that his attention will inspire interest and motivation in his student. It seems to work. Sedgewick devours the Classics. His grades improve so much that he is a contender for a spot in the school's prestigious ""Mr. Julius Caesar"" Roman history competition. But Sedgewick Bell disappoints his mentor -not by losing the competition, but by his conduct, which leaves Prof. Hundert saddened and frustrated that the lessons of ancient leaders had not made an impression on the boy at all, even as he studied them so thoroughly. 25 years later, Sedgewick Bell (Joel Gretsch) is a corporate leader with his eye on a political career when he organizes a class reunion and rematch of the ""Mr. Julius Caesar"" competition. For a second time, Sedgewick Bell leaves Prof. Hundert questioning his success as an educator and learning to live with his failures.""The Emperor's Club"" is an untidy little morality tale. Kevin Kline's performance is excellent, as usual. But I'm not sure what I am supposed to think of this film. And I'm not sure if that is a good thing and a credit to the filmmakers, or a bad thing that they could not get some point across. By the film's end, I do not know if I am supposed to think that Prof. Hundert is a hero or a coward, a genius or a fool. I have to conclude that the fact that I am wondering these things means that the film is thought-provoking and thematically interesting. I'm just not sure if it's that way on purpose. I think teachers will enjoy this film because it portrays teachers as they would like to see themselves. But it also invites a more critical viewing of Prof. Hundert, the ideal teacher, which educators in the audience might do well to consider. The film's themes are not cut-and-dried, and the plot never entirely resolves itself.

It is in fact a wonderful story about human nature (both good and bad), honor, decency, ethics, values, leadership and the impact, for good, that dedicated scholars and teachers can have upon our impressionable youngsters. The story takes place in a upscale prep academy in New England named Saint Benedicts School for Boys.OUR TEACHER&quot;It is not living that is important but living rightly. How will history judge you?&quot;Roman and Greek civilization teacher, William Hundert is magnificently played by Kevin Kline. Our teacher is a honorable and principled man, striving to inspire his students to be ethical and moral by being such a model.Mr Hundert truly enjoys his work. Teaching young boys and trying to influence and mold their character is his lifes work and he is truly in his element.THE STUDENTS&quot;Great ambition and conquest without contribution is without significance. What will your contribution be?&quot;The story centers around Mr Hundert and four students, Martin Blyth, Freddie Masoudi, Deepak Mehta and a troubled young man named Sedgewick Bell. Martin Blyth, whose father is an alum and past winner of The Emperor's Club (A contest not unlike a spelling bee), feels pressure to replicate his fathers achievement. Freddie Masoudi is somewhat of a character and Deepak Mehta is of East Indian descent and academic background. Sedgewick Bell is an unhappy young man, whose father, as a U.S. Senator, has pretty much ignored Sedgewick his whole life. Because of this, Sedgewick has a knack for entertaining himself, usually by methods that get him into trouble.Sedgewick, though troubled, is a born leader, with charm and charisma and soon the other three boys are drawn like a magnet to pal around with him and by association they also get in trouble.The Plot&quot;All of us are forced to look in the mirror and see who we really are.&quot;Mr Hundert is a wonderful teacher, just the kind you would wish for your own children, however, when confronted with a problem child, Sedgewick Bell, son of Senator Hyram Bell, he bends a rule or two which he lives to regret.Sedgewick is a late addition to Hundert's class and seems to want to test Hundert at every opportunity.From Mr. Hundert's perspective, Sedgewick for some reason reminds him of himself and therefore he makes every effort to light a fire under Sedgewick.After numerous incidents involving Sedgewick, which include attempting to skinny dip across the lake at the girls school and likening Hunderts beloved Roman Emperors to the Beatles and the Seven Dwarves, Hundert meets with the boys father, the Senator where he learns firsthand the cause of the problem.Undaunted, Hunert redoubles his efforts with Sedgewick and then seemingly and inexplicably starts to make progress. Sedgewick ostensibly becomes a model student and Hundert is quite pleased with himself.But who is influencing whom? It seems Mr. Hundert is making small concession after concession toward or for the benefit of our erstwhile troublesome studentA yearly event at St Benedicts is the Emperor's Club contest, whereas the top three students in Hundert's class get to face off in front of the students and faculty.Hundert, after just finishing grading the classes, essay type, Finals papers, notices that Sedgewick is in fourth place just behind Martin Blyth. Hundert then makes a dubious decision, which doesn't exactly work out by increasing Sedgewicks grade to place him in the contest.Though it was within his right to make this adjustment, it is in Hundert's mind, a blemish upon his integrity.Twenty Five Years LaterSedgewick now CEO of one of the largest companies in the world recreates the Emperor's Club contest in which he lost earlier and in which Hundert caught but did not expose him cheating. Mr. Hundert and the other students are brought in, all expenses paid toward this purpose.

His view is challenged when the brash young son of a senator comes to the School and decides to upset the discipline he has worked hard to instil in his other students.Hundert doesn't give up on the young man and hopes that by believing in him, he can gradually mould him into a better person. Unfortunately the child's father has no time for him and believes that teachers should stick to teaching facts rather than trying to mould children. The rest of the movie deals with how the different young men (it was a boy's school at the time Hundert was first teaching) turn out. The Senator's son, now a successful grown man, invites his old classmates and history teacher to restage a contest that he had lost when he was in school. Things turn out unexpectedly at this meeting.I wont say anymore on that as it will spoil the rest of the film. What I found interesting was the idea that teachers have a responsibility to do more than just teach facts. It left me wondering whether it was desirable for our education system to mould the children rather than the parents, and as the film shows, many times children aren't given adequate attention by their parents and so pick up their life-skills and values from elsewhere. This movie was a tribute to teachers, but it is also a reminder to the rest of us that we have a responsibility to those we bring into this world.Hopefully I have not given the impression that this is a moralizing tale, it isn't, well not primarily anyway. There are moments of drama and for those (like me) who have lived at boarding schools, it will bring back some memories.

745500,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,B00008NFR4,Octavius,"[4, 4]","Kevin Kline plays Mr. Hundert, an honored teacher of classic studies and assistant headmaster at the prestigious St. Benedict's Academy for Boys. As he tries to instill his students with a stong understanding of virtue and civic duty through the teaching of the classics, he encounters Sedgewcik (Emile Hirsch), a cheating and devious senator's son who feels that leadership and virtue are sufficiently present in image only. The more Mr. Hundert attempts to instill these values in Sedgewick, the more Sedgewick appears to have learned them.The theme of the story seems to revolve around the ancient Platonic debate as to whether morality and virtue is inherently present in character as opposed to being tought or learned. Socrates believed that the potential for virtue was either nascent in an individual or it could not be tought. Mr. Hundert seems to face the same dilemma in the story's plot in trying to instill Sedgewick with a thirst for knowledge and civic virtue. The movie also seems to make a subtle statement about the prevalence of sophistry and lack of character in our modern leaders.Altogether a charming movie about what comprises learning, virtue, and leadership.

They are two very different takes on the 'noble' profession of teaching (if teaching is so noble to those who don't do it...why do teachers get paid terribly?). Anyway, in this Kevin Kline plays a history professor at an exclusive boys school. He does not educate through humor and rebellion and challenge conformity. He is establishment, through and through...so his educates thorugh fostering the love of learning and joy of knowing, so his methods are more traditional than Keating in Dead Poets.As Establishment he is faced with every teacher's nightmare: the student who isn't deceived by the illusion of authority; the student who doesn't want to learn or to respect the him and isn't cowed by the authority he represents. Of course Kevin Kline's character has found his nemisis, in a sense, and this make Kline's character work all the more harder not to fail this child (having a nemisis brings out the best and worst in you both). And this is at the heart of the movie: the moral ambiguity that seeks to justify itself through the ends, by ignoring the means. Its about the moment of dilemma and choice and consequence, where everything balances on a moment and the decision made within. And this Kevin Kline's character seeks to resolve over the course of the movie, with his strong faith in the nobility of humanity and his sense of failuire when it is not achieved by him or his students.There is a strong theme of 'making the man' while educating him that permeates this movie, but it isn't as overt as Dead Poets. It is more subtle and genteel. This movie doesn't seek to challenge establishment but rather show the virtues of the establishment that are noble and worth pursuing, rather than dismissing out of hand. Kline's character isn't a moralizer, rather a guide. He leaves the choice to his boys. It's the whole: 'here is the path to ruin and here is the path of the higher purpose', take that which suits you best and enjoy the consequences. But before you choose....let me educate you of the perils and the prizes...' But he never stops believing in them...and hoping they can't discover their better natures.Beautfully filmed and acted, I really enjoyed this movie. If you sit there comparing this with Dead Poets than you probably wont. Take it on it's merits and let it envelop you and you'll find it a fine movie, that isn't so much fireworks and noise, as gentle, genteel and subtle.Give it a chance.",4,A good movie without the schmaltz,1063238400,"09 11, 2003",2003,2554,"[""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'comparing', 'movie', 'like', 'chalk', 'cheese', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'different', ""'noble"", 'profession', 'teaching', 'teaching', 'so', 'noble', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'why', 'do', 'teachers', 'get', 'paid', 'terribly', 'Anyway', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'history', 'professor', 'exclusive', 'boys', 'school', 'not', 'educate', 'humor', 'rebellion', 'challenge', 'conformity', 'establishment', 'so', 'educates', 'fostering', 'love', 'learning', 'joy', 'knowing', 'methods', 'are', 'more', 'traditional', 'Keating', 'Dead', 'Poets.As', 'Establishment', 'faced', 'teacher', 'nightmare', 'student', 'who', ""n't"", 'deceived', 'illusion', 'authority', 'student', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'learn', 'respect', ""n't"", 'cowed', 'authority', 'course', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'character', 'found', 'nemisis', 'sense', 'make', 'Kline', 'character', 'work', 'more', 'harder', 'not', 'fail', 'child', 'having', 'nemisis', 'out', 'best', 'worst', 'heart', 'movie', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'justify', 'ends', 'ignoring', 'means', 'moment', 'dilemma', 'choice', 'consequence', 'where', 'everything', 'balances', 'moment', 'decision', 'made', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'character', 'resolve', 'course', 'movie', 'strong', 'faith', 'nobility', 'humanity', 'sense', 'failuire', 'when', 'not', 'achieved', 'students.There', 'strong', 'theme', ""'making"", 'man', 'educating', 'movie', ""n't"", 'as', 'overt', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'more', 'subtle', 'genteel', 'movie', ""n't"", 'seek', 'challenge', 'establishment', 'rather', 'show', 'virtues', 'establishment', 'are', 'noble', 'worth', 'pursuing', 'rather', 'dismissing', 'hand', 'Kline', 'character', ""n't"", 'moralizer', 'rather', 'guide', 'choice', 'boys', 'whole', 'path', 'ruin', 'here', 'path', 'higher', 'purpose', 'take', 'suits', 'best', 'enjoy', 'consequences', 'choose', '.let', 'educate', 'perils', 'prizes', 'never', 'believing', 'hoping', 'ca', ""n't"", 'discover', 'better', 'natures.Beautfully', 'filmed', 'acted', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'sit', 'there', 'comparing', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'probably', 'wont', 'Take', 'merits', 'let', 'envelop', ""'ll"", 'find', 'fine', 'movie', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'fireworks', 'noise', 'gentle', 'genteel', 'subtle.Give', 'chance']",N/A
745503,A2EWN4ANV3CPG6,B00008NFR4,Paul Sayles,"[14, 14]","The Emperor's Club is a story of students in a boys school in the late 60s-early 70s. Kevin Kline is a teacher of the Classics (Greeks and Romans) and is the assistant headmaster of the school.  He is a man who's life is his work which he takes seriously to a fault.  Kline, as a teacher, I think sees that each student is an individual and treats them as such.His greatest test is dealing with a student, the son of a US senator, who arrives with an arrogance that is extremely off-putting.  In thoday's view, I would rate this new student as extremely toxic in his influence.  Kline's character tries to reach the student and for a short period of time, succeeds.  The turning point, is a lecture to the student by his senator father to shape up, and the competition for the Mr. Julius Cesear contest run by Kline.  The student shapes up, scores improve and, after soul searching by Kline, reaches the final threee for the competition.  In the competition, the toxic element takes hold and Kline discovers that the student is cheating.  Rather than expose the student, Kline eliminates him by asking a question that only the other contestant remaining in the competition will know.  When Kline confronts the student about it, and asks ""Why"" the student's reply of ""why not?"" is telling about his personality.  From then on the student is the focus of every moment of indiscipline in the school and remains so until he graduates.25 years later a rematch is arranged and history repeats itself. Again Kline does not publicly confront the student, now a senatorial candidate, with his acts, in public.  Rather he gives a quick lecture in the men's room to the student, apparently just between them.  There is one listener though, who makes a surprise appearence.  The other students, now successful men in their own right, meet with their former teacher and honor him for his many successes.This movie may be trite to some.  However in this climate of economic retrenchment and state budget deficits remedied by eviserating school budgets (California), this film is a refreshing look at education as it could be.  It is a movie with no surprises, but there are many none the less.I had the opportunity to see this film on flights to and from Japan so I watched it three times on each flight.  It is the best picture I have seen in the past 12 months.  Kline is exceptional in his performance.  Edward Herrmann is also excellent as the headmaster of the school.  His scenes, while brief for the most part, are critical to the success of the film.Careful cast selection of the boys and their adult counter-parts was also critical to the success of the film's theme.  It is an ensemble casting that works well.The school is also an impressive part of the film.  You arrive at the school in the late 60s and by the turn of the century, you have seen changes that are not dramatic by themselves but are none-the-less important.  The school has moved from being a boys school to a co-ed school.  You see a school adapting to the times.  You could say that this is a representation of an elitest school that has no bearing on reality today.  However, schools such as these are still turning out the bulk of our leaders, now and tomorrow, so I do not see it as an irrelevant topic.  It is a reality that is still with us.  Not quite a ""To Serve Them All My Days"" story, but a close second to it.This is an exceptional film that I think is a must see for everyone.  It is a tremendous vehicle for Kevin Kline and I was disappointed that he was not recognized for a stellar performance.

Yet, this movie is inspiring to watch.  In this instance, Kevin Kline plays Mr. Hundert, a well-read and serious but patient history teacher who is not only passionate about Roman and Western civilisation but interested in well-being of his students.  Mr. Hundert finds it essential to mould the character of the students at first for the end depends upon the beginning.  Naturally, the coccoon of respect between the teacher and his students would be undone with arrival of the son of a Senator who seems to have a chip upon his shoulder.  Yet, he's charismatic and his misdemenours would be overlooked by everyone except Mr. Hundert who refuses to give up on him, to no avail as we would find in the end. To cut the story short, the movie would gradually fast forward to twenty five years later & the Senator's son would break Mr. Hundert's heart once again.  Even that is so, he learnt a lesson from his students that whilst there might be failure in our lives, one should always remember to take the good with the bad, for the good deed that he's done would most definitely surpass the deed that he could have done better.  This movie is directed in a straight-forward manner, no going off a tangent and it slowly unfolds itself as an adult movie is expected to do.  There is a subplot about love interest of Mr. Hundert but it rarely lifts as time allocates to develop that is rather scant.

I should know of course. But what I don't understand is how reviewers here have managed to give this ""storyless"" movie 5 and 4 stars. I mean, the acting by Kline and the rest of the cast was good (absolutely), but that doesn't save this sorry attempt of telling a so ungripping story with such lack of moral (referring here to that other boy who should have been in the J.C-contest, the movie does not in any way try to justify that in a good way in my opinion).It starts out well. Reminded me instantly of ""Dead Poets..."", but do not worry you fans of ""The Emperors' Club"" -this movie is nothing like ""Dead Poets..."" and is far from worthy of being compared to it! And the only positive thing about ""The Emperors' Club"" is the fact that it is not trying to.I thought at first that this was a movie that was going to about the struggle between a teacher and one of his intelligent, but spoiled rich mans' son-student having a big problem fitting in and with the the school-system works. It sets out like this, and starts out this way interesting, and the acting is good. Then suddenly the teacher finds a way to make this student listen to him and take his school-acchievments more seriously. And from here it goes fast! Suddenly he is amongst the schools' best students. He is picked out from his high grades to join a traditional contest, where for some reason he cheats. And after that we're told by Klines' characters' narration that this boy went back in being the menace he started out as. Ok? And there's yet another HOUR of the movie! What will this movie be about now then? -that was my immediate question. Suddenly ""The Emperors' Club is about nothing. There's a woman involved in the teachers' life, if she's his sister or lover or whatever -the movie is so unclear and unpersonal. The girls some of the boys sneak over to ""visit"", and gets caught. We don't see anything more to them, do we? Is this movie about a mans' life? Well, then tell me who this man is!And theming up with his old students many years later (25 or so) to look back and have a laugh of it all, so what? I didn't bother to see the new contest, but I doubt that this bad excuse for making a movie had any more surprises to serve.

Zwick,"[13, 14]","From &#65533;Goodbye Mr. Chips&#65533; in the 1930&#65533;s to &#65533;Dead Poet&#65533;s Society&#65533; in the 1980&#65533;s, the movies have had a long-running love affair with inspirational, sentimental stories set at ivy-covered, collegiate-gothic, all-male prep schools.  These films inevitably center around a beloved teacher and the lifelong bond he forges with his devoted students.The latest addition to the genre &#65533; a successful one &#65533; is &#65533;The Emperor&#65533;s Club,&#65533; with Kevin Kline assuming the role of the teacher who considers it his duty not only to instruct his students in the details of classical history but to mold them into men of integrity and character in the process.  &#65533;The Emperor&#65533;s Club&#65533; follows the standard formula up to a point.  William Hundert is the most highly respected faculty member at St. Benedict&#65533;s Academy.  He is able to bring the history of the ancient Greeks and Romans to vivid life for his admittedly highly motivated young charges.  Then, one day, into his classroom strides Sedgwick Bell, a bright, highly unmotivated student who would rather mock the stuffiness of education and inspire his buddies to feats of rabblerousing than devote his life to the serious pursuit of academia.  It, thus, becomes Hundert&#65533;s job to turn Sedgwick around, a feat that always seems much easier to accomplish in the movies than it ever is in real life.&#65533;The Emperor&#65533;s Club,&#65533; after its rather conventional beginning, deviates from its predecessors in one key respect:  Hundert, though a man of values and integrity, is not above compromise himself, and he winds up making a very serious one, the ramifications of which he has to live with for many years to come.  Rather than showing him as some sort of saintly figure, screenwriter Neil Tolkin (working from a short story by Ethan Canin) and director Michael Hoffman allow Hundert&#65533;s humanity to shine through.  He is a flawed individual who permits personal feelings to cloud his judgments and who is willing, once he has created a problem, to allow the truth of his own guilt to remain hidden even when innocent victims suffer as a result of his actions.  &#65533;The Emperor&#65533;s Club&#65533; is also notable for its clear-eyed recognition that not all situations in life need have a satisfying resolution, that some people simply do not acknowledge their own failings and, therefore, never develop into morally superior people no matter how many experiences life throws at them.  Yet, what breaks Hundert&#65533;s heart is the recognition he comes to that such a person is often times more highly rewarded by the world than the man who follows along the straight-and-narrow path all his life.Kline gives a superb performance as Hundert, capturing the quiet dignity, understated passion and conflicted conscience of a man who loves his boys and who tries to do the right thing but who, like the rest of us, doesn&#65533;t always succeed in doing so.  Emile Hirsch is also excellent as young Sedgwick, the boy whose need for attention and lack of moral guidance from his father lead him to accept the winning-at-all-cost philosophy to get him through life.&#65533;The Emperor&#65533;s Club,&#65533; despite having its roots firmly planted in a grand storytelling tradition, still manages to take us into new territory from time to time &#65533; and its recognition of the importance of education and academics (we actually get to learn a little about Roman history while watching the movie) makes it virtually unique among films of its time.",4,All Hail Kevin Kline,1057449600,"07 6, 2003",2003,3615,"['65533', 'Goodbye', 'Mr.', 'Chips', '65533', '1930', '65533', 's', '65533', 'Dead', 'Poet', '65533', 's', 'Society', '65533', '1980', '65533', 's', 'movies', 'have', 'had', 'long-running', 'love', 'affair', 'inspirational', 'sentimental', 'stories', 'set', 'ivy-covered', 'collegiate-gothic', 'all-male', 'prep', 'schools', 'films', 'inevitably', 'center', 'beloved', 'teacher', 'lifelong', 'bond', 'devoted', 'students.The', 'latest', 'addition', 'genre', '65533', 'successful', 'one', '65533', '65533', 'Emperor', '65533', 's', 'Club', '65533', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'assuming', 'role', 'teacher', 'who', 'duty', 'not', 'only', 'instruct', 'students', 'details', 'classical', 'history', 'mold', 'men', 'integrity', 'character', 'process', '65533', 'Emperor', '65533', 's', 'Club', '65533', 'standard', 'up', 'point', 'William', 'Hundert', 'most', 'highly', 'respected', 'faculty', 'member', 'St.', 'Benedict', '65533', 's', 'Academy', 'able', 'bring', 'history', 'ancient', 'Greeks', 'Romans', 'vivid', 'life', 'admittedly', 'highly', 'motivated', 'young', 'charges', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'classroom', 'Sedgwick', 'Bell', 'bright', 'highly', 'unmotivated', 'student', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'mock', 'stuffiness', 'education', 'inspire', 'buddies', 'feats', 'rabblerousing', 'devote', 'life', 'serious', 'pursuit', 'academia', 'thus', 'Hundert', '65533', 's', 'job', 'turn', 'Sedgwick', 'feat', 'always', 'much', 'easier', 'accomplish', 'movies', 'ever', 'real', 'life.', '65533', 'Emperor', '65533', 's', 'Club', '65533', 'rather', 'conventional', 'beginning', 'predecessors', 'one', 'key', 'respect', 'Hundert', 'man', 'values', 'integrity', 'not', 'above', 'compromise', 'up', 'making', 'very', 'serious', 'one', 'ramifications', 'live', 'many', 'years', 'come', 'Rather', 'showing', 'sort', 'saintly', 'figure', 'screenwriter', 'Neil', 'Tolkin', 'working', 'short', 'story', 'Ethan', 'Canin', 'director', 'Michael', 'Hoffman', 'allow', 'Hundert', '65533', 's', 'humanity', 'shine', 'flawed', 'individual', 'who', 'personal', 'feelings', 'cloud', 'judgments', 'who', 'willing', 'once', 'created', 'problem', 'allow', 'truth', 'own', 'guilt', 'remain', 'hidden', 'even', 'when', 'innocent', 'victims', 'suffer', 'result', 'actions', '65533', 'Emperor', '65533', 's', 'Club', '65533', 'also', 'notable', 'clear-eyed', 'recognition', 'not', 'situations', 'life', 'need', 'have', 'satisfying', 'resolution', 'people', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'acknowledge', 'own', 'failings', 'therefore', 'never', 'develop', 'morally', 'superior', 'people', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'experiences', 'life', 'throws', 'what', 'Hundert', '65533', 's', 'heart', 'recognition', 'person', 'often', 'times', 'more', 'highly', 'rewarded', 'world', 'man', 'who', 'straight-and-narrow', 'path', 'life.Kline', 'superb', 'performance', 'Hundert', 'capturing', 'quiet', 'dignity', 'understated', 'passion', 'conflicted', 'conscience', 'man', 'who', 'boys', 'who', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'who', 'rest', 'doesn', '65533', 't', 'always', 'succeed', 'doing', 'so', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'also', 'excellent', 'young', 'Sedgwick', 'boy', 'need', 'attention', 'lack', 'moral', 'guidance', 'father', 'lead', 'accept', 'winning-at-all-cost', 'philosophy', 'get', 'life.', '65533', 'Emperor', '65533', 's', 'Club', '65533', 'having', 'roots', 'firmly', 'planted', 'grand', 'storytelling', 'tradition', 'still', 'take', 'new', 'territory', 'time', 'time', '65533', 'recognition', 'importance', 'education', 'academics', 'actually', 'get', 'learn', 'little', 'Roman', 'history', 'watching', 'movie', 'virtually', 'unique', 'films', 'time']",N/A

On the negative side the subplots are thin and not explored.  The motivation for some of the action is missing or only implied.  Kevin Kline is an excellent actor but because he must substitute expression for dialog he frequently comes across as suffering from acute constipation.  BUT THIS IS A GREAT FILM -- especially today when cheating is so rampant and seems to be so accepted.The movie rests on three moral issues.  The teacher is highly motivated and truly believes in morality, virtue, dedication, and service to others. When confronted with a student with great potential but poor values and worse motivation, he compromises in order he thinks to salvage the student.  The headmaster when confronted with the knowledge that there has been cheating elects to ignore it.  Should the teacher expose the cheater for what he is? The cheater only believes in winning at any cost and if that cost is cheating then so be it, because he places no value on honor, integrity, or honesty.  Is a life built on sham, selfishness,and devoid of virtue and honor worthy of respect?  Is the price of cheating paid in self-respect?  Can hyprocrisy substitute for honor, commitment, and integrity?  These questions are mostly left open for the audience to decide and for this reason this is a great movie to watch with your teenage children or even young adults.  Too often the temptation to cheat in order to win seems like the easy path and others that take that path -- as they do in this movie -- seem to be the winers in life, but at what cost?  This movie explores that question without preaching or even providing an answer.

745514,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B00008NFR4,Sebastian Fernandez,"[2, 2]","In this marvelous movie we find ourselves facing the concept of how important teachers are, how they shape our lives and how they give us the tools for succeeding as individuals. Most of the viewers will probably find themselves at some point reminiscing with nostalgia about one or more of the influential teachers in their lives. The story line presents similarities with movies like &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;, with both Robin Williams in that case and Kevin Kline in this one playing the roles of outstanding educators.The film starts with Mr. Hundert (Kline), a retired teacher after a career of thirty-four years, showing up at a reunion with his class of 1976. This was a group of students that marked him deeply, and he goes on to remember the events that lead to that situation.Mr. Hundert is history teacher, covering Western Civilizations, the Greeks and the Romans; he is very passionate about his job and the students adore him. Every year a history competition is held, with the winner being crowned as Julius Caesar. Everything is working out perfectly, until Sedgewick Bell, a new student, joins the St. Benedict School for boys. Sedgewick is the son of a senator for West Virginia and he transforms the anger he carries due to his father's lack of interest in his life, in irreverence, contempt and arrogance. Mr. Hundert has to find a way to control this new student and motivate him into having goals and aspirations, before he jeopardizes the teacher's control over the rest of the class. One of the tools to achieve this is the Julius Caesar competition.This highly enjoyable movie gets people thinking on the importance of the building blocks in each person's life and on how teachers are, as much as parents, part of shaping this base.

What this film points out is how influential teachers in particular prep schools are. As he looks over his students at an alumni dinner, he's seeing the &quot;Who's Who of industry, politics and higher education..&quot; This is the kind of hothouse where our future leaders are raised. That so many of them turn out well was Mr. Hundert's consolation and our blessing. Considering how many of these boys (and now girls) are simply farmed out to boarding schools by &quot;busy&quot; parents, we owe those teachers more gratitude than we usually give them.If the swaggering, smirky Senator's son bears some resemblance to George W., that is surely coincidental. Both Emile Hirsch and Joel Gretz give Sedgewick Bell charisma without conscience, and you understand why Hundert keeps trying and hoping to get through to this natural leader... It's marvelous casting, and they are both excellent.This is the kind of film &quot;they don't make any more.&quot; They do make them, but nobody buys tickets.

But the script is taut. What really shimmers though is the acting. Kevin Kline is, as always, in top form, he neither underplays nor overplays his professor role getting everything just right, from his quiet, guilt-ridden introspection to the light comedy that results from a frivolous baseball game. And as the counterpart protagonist Emile Hirsch displays the arrogant bravado one expects from a bad seed student rather well.All in all, I probably wouldn't see this movie more than once, but it's a worthwhile rental.

He articulates the drive and determination of Hundert perfectly. The young actors are also phenomenal and this is a breakout film for many of them:  Emile Hirsch is everywhere now; Paul Dano is rising up as is Jesse Eisenberg (who was just in the Squid and the Whale).2) James Newton Howard's score to the film is very engaging and definitely makes the pivotal scenes that much more powerful.3) The theme is centered on character.  Shutruk-Nahhunte is not known of today because he gave back nothing.  He just did for himself and contributed nothing to society.  Sedgewick ""is"" Nahhunte.  Though on the outside, he seems successful, Sedgewick will probably not contribute much to the good of others.  The other historical people in Hundert's curriculum are people who gave back or contributed something to their respective societies.  They are remembered because they left a good legacy on life.  It is hinted that the other students will go on to leave similar legacies, while Sedgewick will not.  (Though in the deleted scenes you see how the director was trying to make this more evident; it just didn't flow well.)4) As a teacher, this is a favorite of mine and perhaps that biases my review. (In a good way, bad way, who knows)?  I have shown parts of this film in class with very positive reactions from my students.  The film is unique; it shows the main characters young, and then shows how they end up later in life.  Kids are always thinking about how they'll end up and I think they appreciate that aspect of the film especially.

While &quot;Dead Poets&quot; was about a boy's coming of age, &quot;Emperor's Club&quot; is about a teacher's coming to grips with his life's failure.

Though the film had its flaws, I saw Robin William's character (Mr. Keating) as rather convincing. I guess I expected The Emperor's Club to be somewhat similar. I was wrong.Like Dead Poets, the movie is set in an elite prep school for boys. The school is steeped in tradition and the students will inevitably be the leaders of society. Using many clich&eacute;d techniques, Kevin Kline's character of William Hundert tries to inspire his students. Good teachers develop relationships with students over time, but this does not happen in The Emperor's Club. Mr. Hundert is revered much too soon. Sure, there are a few new teacher pranks, but they seem a bit unrealistic. Though Kline plays the role masterfully, his character is somewhat one dimensional, and the writers try to fix this situation. He has a love interest. The woman he eventually marries is the wife of a colleague. The two begin to fall in love just before she leaves for England. After a divorce she returns to marry Kline. What a surprise! It was either an attempt to give Kline a life outside of the school or to quell suspicions about the character's sexuality.Still, there are strengths in the film. One character, Sedwedge Bell, played by Emile Hirsch, is a troubled youth who challenges Hundert. Naturally Hundert takes an interest in the young man. While he does reach the Bell, the young man is unwilling to change, and he remains this way even to adulthood. Kline's character also has to address ethical flaws in his judgment, which never really get resolved. These realistic situations could have made The Emperor's Club a wonderful film. Instead it is simply not bad.",2,"Great Acting, Disappointing Story",1056931200,"06 30, 2003",2003,1709,"['Early', 'teaching', 'career', 'saw', 'movie', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'film', 'had', 'flaws', 'saw', 'Robin', 'William', 'character', 'Mr.', 'Keating', 'rather', 'convincing', 'guess', 'expected', 'Emperor', 'Club', 'be', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'was', 'wrong.Like', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'movie', 'set', 'elite', 'prep', 'school', 'boys', 'school', 'steeped', 'tradition', 'students', 'will', 'inevitably', 'be', 'leaders', 'society', 'Using', 'many', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'techniques', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'character', 'William', 'Hundert', 'inspire', 'students', 'Good', 'teachers', 'develop', 'relationships', 'students', 'time', 'not', 'happen', 'Emperor', 'Club', 'Mr.', 'Hundert', 'revered', 'much', 'too', 'soon', 'Sure', 'are', 'few', 'new', 'teacher', 'pranks', 'seem', 'bit', 'unrealistic', 'Kline', 'role', 'masterfully', 'character', 'somewhat', 'one', 'dimensional', 'writers', 'try', 'fix', 'situation', 'love', 'interest', 'woman', 'eventually', 'wife', 'colleague', 'two', 'begin', 'fall', 'love', 'just', 'England', 'divorce', 'marry', 'Kline', 'What', 'surprise', 'was', 'attempt', 'give', 'Kline', 'life', 'school', 'quell', 'suspicions', 'character', 'sexuality.Still', 'are', 'strengths', 'film', 'One', 'character', 'Sedwedge', 'Bell', 'played', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'troubled', 'youth', 'who', 'Hundert', 'Naturally', 'Hundert', 'interest', 'young', 'man', 'reach', 'Bell', 'young', 'man', 'unwilling', 'change', 'way', 'even', 'adulthood', 'Kline', 'character', 'also', 'address', 'ethical', 'flaws', 'judgment', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'resolved', 'realistic', 'situations', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'Emperor', 'Club', 'wonderful', 'film', 'Instead', 'simply', 'not', 'bad']",N/A
745520,AJ88Z1U0SS1IY,B00008NFR4,"Tim Warneka ""Leadership Expert, Keynote Speak...","[3, 15]","Dreading a ""Dead Poet's Society"" rip-off, I held my breath when my wife popped this movie into the DVD player. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised. Kevin Kline has developed into a phenomenal actor, and I always enjoy watching him. He really showed a passion for the classics, and wanting his young charges to develop this same degree of respect.CAUTION: SPOILERS AHEAD....The story, however, didn't hold together for me, so I must disagree with many of the other reviewers. While much of the story elements seemed to be intended to be dramatic, these elements came across to me as a painful reminder of class and priviledge. To wit, if one is the son of a Senator, then one can pretty much do as he pleases. Some of the story elements that were missing for me included:1. Sedgewick does no work. He gets bad grades A teacher hands him a book, and suddenly he is a studying demon. Why the change? No explanation, credible or otherwise, was offered for this inexplicable change in a student's behavior.2. Senator tells teacher to NOT mold his son's character. Teacher goes back to school and gives said son one of teacher's own textbook. WHY?3. Teacher changes Sedgewick's grade in order for him to compete in a prestigious competition in the school. Two things bothered me here:A. WHY did Kline's character change the grade? Simply because this kid suddenly started to do some work. To me, it came across more as a response to Sedgewick being a Senator's son (I can imagine this scenario happening repeatedly throughout George W. Bush's ed-ya-ka-shun, with the role of Sedgewick being aptly played by W.)B. This fancy prep school has a ""school wide"" competition where apparently the only events are subjective essays graded soley by one teacher? And the teacher doesn't even do a blind review on the essays? That simply made no sense to me.4. A group of boys row across the lake to the girls school, and a nun catches the youngsters in various stages of undress in broad daylight. The boys' punishment from this noble assistant headmaster for this heinous crime? They get sent to bed without supper?!? Let's see.....let's choose here.....talk to pretty young ladies...eat dinner.....hmmmmm. Had my friends and I had gone to that school, if being sent to bed without supper was the worst punishment they could hand out, I can assure you that the entire population of my class would have established residency on that dock outside the girls' school.5. And this romantic subplot between Kline's character and the other teacher..what was up with that? She divorced her husband and returned from Europe in order to....live in a big house and serve tea to Kline's character? Did they get married or what? Did she go back to teaching at Hogwart's....err...St. Benedict? That was never clear in the story line, and neither character wore a wedding ring. Kline and the actress (sorry, forgot her name) did a wonderful job in their roles, but this subplot remained SO underdeveloped that it should have just been left out.6. Decades pass, and Kline's character is asked to moderate Sedgewick's return to glory...and this noble teacher NEVER has ONE conversation about Sedgewick's previous cheating? Even when the two men are alone together the night before the big event? The fact that Sedgewick was going to cheat again was telegraphed a mile away.7. Finally, what was UP with that conversation between Sedgewick and Kline's characters the night before the re-match? ""Oh, boo hoo, my father died before I could talk to him. Boo hoo."" I can cry at scenes like those along with the best of them, but that scene felt entirely false. I was waiting for the adult Sedgewick to try and steal the index cards with Kline's character's questions on them. Or, Sedgewick was trying to manipulate Kline's character into feeling guilty for him, but Sedgewick's motivation for disclosing this information was not made clear in the movie.I could keep going, but for those of you I haven't put to sleep yet, I'll sum it up.

And you are quite doing well, ardently infusing the belief of education into the students who honestly respect you.  Then, a senetor's son Sedgewick Bell (Emile Hirsch) is sent to your class, whose idea of spending time in school is totally different than yours, not taking any of your words seriously.In short, the defiant new boy Sedgewick needs help.  Mr. Hundert wouldn't be defeated, however, and a kind of battle of will starts.  And after all, the boy has a brain, and a good one, too.  He starts to learn earnestly, and joins in the prestigeous 'Julius Caesar' contest, where lots of tough questions about the Roman history are asked.  Surprisingly, Sedgewick is one of the finalists, and the teacher is now happy until he discovers something very annoying, something that shakes his belief fundamentally.And 25 years later, an invitation comes from Sedgewick.  Mr. Hundert accpets it, and find the truths about his character.The comaprison with &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; or &quot;Mr. Holland's Opus&quot; (though the latter is not about prep school) is understandable.  One common factor is that the central character is played by great actor with first-rate performance, and &quot;Emperor's Club&quot; can boast the superb acting of Kevin Cline who covers the time of 25 years.  Capable players like Embeth Davitz, Steven Culp, Rob Morrow, Harris Yulin (as Senator), Patrick Dempsy, and Edward Herrmann appear, but the film belongs solely to Kevin Kline.But the comparion is also misleading, for this film shows a certain aspect of human nature in the end.  I do not reveal it, but the film is mainly about one (just one) big failure that tormented &quot;Mr. H&quot; who believes in the idea of integrirty in life.  He, simple teacher as he says, has a natural reason to regret what he had done to Sedgewick, or other students.This is the part that devides the opinions of the watchers.  There is a moving finale that reminds you of &quot;Mr. Holland,&quot; but the more faacinating side of the film is its undercurrent that makes you think.  Clearly he made a mistake, though no one can deny that he is a good teacher.Can a man change by education?  Can a teacher really mould the character of students?  Though prep shcool is not exactly the place many of us can relate to, the theme is universal, and &quot;The Emperor's Club&quot; presents the question very boldly.  Regrettably many factors of the film besides it are nothing original (like secret meeting girls in dorm), but still a worthy film about the value of education.  And Kevin Cline is so good.",4,&quot;How WIll You Be Remembered?&quot; B Plus School Drama,1082073600,"04 16, 2004",2004,2698,"['are', 'Mr.', 'William', 'Hundert', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'perfect', 'dedicated', 'Roman', 'history', 'teacher', 'prep', 'shoool', 'early', '1970s', 'are', 'quite', 'doing', 'well', 'ardently', 'infusing', 'belief', 'education', 'students', 'who', 'honestly', 'respect', 'Then', 'senetor', 'son', 'Sedgewick', 'Bell', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'sent', 'class', 'idea', 'spending', 'time', 'school', 'totally', 'different', 'yours', 'not', 'taking', 'words', 'seriously.In', 'short', 'defiant', 'new', 'boy', 'Sedgewick', 'help', 'Mr.', 'Hundert', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'defeated', 'however', 'kind', 'battle', 'will', 'starts', 'boy', 'brain', 'good', 'one', 'too', 'learn', 'earnestly', 'prestigeous', 'Caesar', 'contest', 'where', 'lots', 'tough', 'questions', 'Roman', 'history', 'are', 'asked', 'Surprisingly', 'Sedgewick', 'one', 'finalists', 'teacher', 'now', 'happy', 'something', 'very', 'annoying', 'something', 'belief', '25', 'years', 'later', 'invitation', 'Sedgewick', 'Mr.', 'Hundert', 'find', 'truths', 'character.The', 'comaprison', 'quot', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'quot', 'quot', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'Opus', 'quot', 'latter', 'not', 'prep', 'school', 'understandable', 'One', 'common', 'factor', 'central', 'character', 'played', 'great', 'actor', 'first-rate', 'performance', 'quot', 'Emperor', 'Club', 'quot', 'can', 'boast', 'superb', 'acting', 'Kevin', 'Cline', 'who', 'time', '25', 'years', 'Capable', 'players', 'Embeth', 'Davitz', 'Steven', 'Culp', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'Harris', 'Yulin', 'Senator', 'Patrick', 'Dempsy', 'Edward', 'Herrmann', 'appear', 'film', 'solely', 'Kevin', 'Kline.But', 'comparion', 'also', 'misleading', 'film', 'certain', 'aspect', 'human', 'nature', 'end', 'do', 'not', 'reveal', 'film', 'mainly', 'one', 'just', 'one', 'big', 'failure', 'tormented', 'quot', 'Mr.', 'H', 'quot', 'who', 'idea', 'integrirty', 'life', 'simple', 'teacher', 'natural', 'reason', 'regret', 'what', 'had', 'done', 'Sedgewick', 'other', 'students.This', 'part', 'opinions', 'watchers', 'moving', 'finale', 'quot', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'quot', 'more', 'faacinating', 'side', 'film', 'undercurrent', 'think', 'Clearly', 'made', 'mistake', 'one', 'can', 'deny', 'good', 'teacher.Can', 'man', 'change', 'education', 'Can', 'teacher', 'really', 'mould', 'character', 'students', 'prep', 'shcool', 'not', 'exactly', 'place', 'many', 'can', 'relate', 'theme', 'universal', 'quot', 'Emperor', 'Club', 'quot', 'question', 'very', 'boldly', 'Regrettably', 'many', 'factors', 'film', 'are', 'nothing', 'original', 'secret', 'meeting', 'girls', 'dorm', 'still', 'worthy', 'film', 'value', 'education', 'Kevin', 'Cline', 'so', 'good']",N/A
