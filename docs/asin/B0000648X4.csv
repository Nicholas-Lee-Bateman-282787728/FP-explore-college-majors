699336,AFZ41PKYX29G0,B0000648X4,Catharsise,"[3, 3]","This is a GREAT dvd, however we are missing the story arc I have loosely named the Frozen (or Lost) Asteroid Campaign and it directly precedes the Klendathu Campaign.  Without revealing content, the &quot;Frozen Asteroid&quot; arc introduces new bugs (Fireflies) and answers the questions: What was referred to in the Homefront Campaign as the destroyed Transport Bug, and why the Troopers felt the war was over.The missing episodes are &quot;Ice-Olation&quot;, &quot;Mixed Signals&quot;, &quot;Hot Ice&quot;, &quot;The Inside Story&quot;, and &quot;The Ice Men Goeth&quot;.War is hell with no true victories and the Homefront Campaign drives this &quot;home&quot;.  Throughout this series we have lived with the members of the Roughnecks and have developed a kinship with them.  Now our kinship will be translated into emotion and empathy.  No more hot, cold, wet and inhospitable planets to fight on, we are home.  We are safe, but we are not alone.  The bugs have inexplicably arrived, adapted, and infested.  The war now will be fought using the family car as a shield, the front door as a barricade and the radio as our window to the world.  When it comes to &quot;bug&quot; infestation, on a grand scale, victory may mean that &quot;we&quot; are expendable.  Action sequences take place in familiar surroundings; the streets of our cities.  The Homefront Campaign is definitely the most visceral story arc in this series and will leave you with an unexpected sense of loss.

699338,AC9UO8H2VCZI2,B0000648X4,Dwayne A. Day,"[0, 0]","Trying to figure out how this series was produced was a little confusing.  The plan was to produce 40 episodes.  However, the filmmakers ran low on money late in production and so they cheated a bit.  They made several &quot;clip&quot; shows that were nothing more than scenes from previous episodes strung together.  They skipped an episode completely (episode 33).  So there are not really 40 complete episodes, which explains why there are only seven discs, with an eighth due in June 2004.  But they also did not film the final three stories that they wrote--the stories that end the war.  This campaign ends and the war is still raging.But when they released the DVDs they also did some annoying things.  For starters, the DVDs are not clearly numbered, so it is a little hard to figure out which one is first, second, third, etc. unless you look that information up.  Some of the filmmaker's commentary tracks are repetitive.  But one of the more annoying things is that they actually SKIPPED an episode that was after the Klendathuu Campaign and before the stories on this DVD.  That one had the troopers hunting down the alien queen in space.  The result is that this campaign starts rather abruptly with the war over and no explanation as to how that happened.  It is really annoying and you only learn what happened by listening to the commentary track.  That episode will be released in June 2004, but its exclusion from this disc lowers the value of this DVD.That said, there is some excellent storytelling here, and also some plot holes.  A major character gets killed and the troopers hold a funeral for him.  It is fairly powerful for a show that was ostensibly aimed at kids.[SPOILERS]However, I also was annoyed at some plot holes.  For starters, at one point we are told that earth has been devastated by the bugs and that &quot;no major landmarks remain standing.&quot;  Then a few minutes later we learn that San Francisco is completely intact.  When Lt. Razak gets killed he is blown up, underwater.  Yet in the next episode the troopers are gathered to spread his ashes over a lake.  Where did they get the ashes from?  He was blown up!  And in the final episode, when they are battling on Hawaii, most of the action concerns their efforts to keep a radio tower up and yet one wonders why they don't simply use satellite communications.  The show was usually well thought and executed, but occasionally they had the characters do rather stupid things just so the plot could carry along.",4,"A little schizophrenic, but still enjoyable",1085270400,"05 23, 2004",2004,2508,"['Trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'series', 'was', 'produced', 'was', 'little', 'confusing', 'plan', 'was', 'produce', '40', 'episodes', 'However', 'filmmakers', 'ran', 'low', 'money', 'late', 'production', 'so', 'cheated', 'bit', 'made', 'several', 'quot', 'clip', 'quot', 'shows', 'were', 'nothing', 'more', 'scenes', 'previous', 'episodes', 'strung', 'together', 'skipped', 'episode', 'completely', 'episode', '33', 'are', 'not', 'really', '40', 'complete', 'episodes', 'why', 'are', 'only', 'seven', 'discs', 'eighth', 'due', 'June', '2004', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'film', 'final', 'three', 'stories', 'wrote', 'stories', 'end', 'war', 'campaign', 'war', 'still', 'raging.But', 'when', 'released', 'DVDs', 'also', 'did', 'annoying', 'things', 'starters', 'DVDs', 'are', 'not', 'clearly', 'numbered', 'little', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'one', 'first', 'second', 'third', 'etc', 'look', 'information', 'up', 'filmmaker', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'are', 'repetitive', 'one', 'more', 'annoying', 'things', 'actually', 'SKIPPED', 'episode', 'was', 'Klendathuu', 'Campaign', 'stories', 'DVD', 'one', 'had', 'troopers', 'hunting', 'down', 'alien', 'queen', 'space', 'result', 'campaign', 'rather', 'abruptly', 'war', 'explanation', 'how', 'happened', 'really', 'annoying', 'only', 'learn', 'what', 'happened', 'listening', 'commentary', 'track', 'episode', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'June', '2004', 'exclusion', 'disc', 'value', 'DVD.That', 'said', 'excellent', 'storytelling', 'here', 'also', 'plot', 'holes', 'major', 'character', 'killed', 'troopers', 'hold', 'funeral', 'fairly', 'powerful', 'show', 'was', 'ostensibly', 'aimed', 'kids', '[', 'SPOILERS', ']', 'However', 'also', 'was', 'annoyed', 'plot', 'holes', 'starters', 'one', 'point', 'are', 'told', 'earth', 'been', 'devastated', 'bugs', 'quot', 'major', 'landmarks', 'remain', 'standing.', 'quot', 'Then', 'few', 'minutes', 'later', 'learn', 'San', 'Francisco', 'completely', 'intact', 'When', 'Lt.', 'Razak', 'killed', 'blown', 'up', 'underwater', 'next', 'episode', 'troopers', 'are', 'gathered', 'spread', 'ashes', 'lake', 'Where', 'did', 'get', 'ashes', 'was', 'blown', 'up', 'final', 'episode', 'when', 'are', 'battling', 'Hawaii', 'most', 'action', 'efforts', 'keep', 'radio', 'tower', 'up', 'yet', 'one', 'wonders', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'simply', 'use', 'satellite', 'communications', 'show', 'was', 'usually', 'well', 'thought', 'executed', 'occasionally', 'had', 'characters', 'do', 'rather', 'stupid', 'things', 'just', 'so', 'plot', 'could', 'carry', 'along']",Roughnecks -  The Starship Troopers Chronicles - The Homefront Campaign

Perhaps now the rest of the world can appreciate the frustration of the fans that this series was never completed. Episode 33 was never made due to budget limitations and episode 31 was skipped over since only 5 episodes would fit on the disk (according to the commentaries anyway). The grand finale, episodes 38 - 40, were scripted but never animated. Perhaps now that the series is available on DVD the demand for more episodes will be overwhelming. Frankly, I was hoping they'd be able to squeeze episode 31 on this disc as well, since now there is an episode gap between the Klendathu Campaign and the Homefront Campaign. Still, if I was forced to choose between episode 31 and the last televised episode of the series, I would have made the same choice. So even though this disc isn't all an obsessive fanboy could hope for, it still offers up the best and brightest episodes of the entire Roughnecks series!This campaign brings the Arachnid conflict to Earth's own back yard. Mutant Bug clones will try to infiltrate our civilian infrastructure. Loyalties will be divided between saving civilian lives and eradicating the Arachnid menace. Our heros will face a crushing personal loss to their own squad (one of the main characters will NOT live to see the end of this campaign). But if our heros aren't able to pull themselves together, the planet Earth may not have any hope for a future. This is the climax the entire series has be building toward.

During the close of the Klendathu campaign, the Arachnid Queen escapes and SICON forces follow her trail. They find her in deep space and after pitched battle destroy the Royal Transport. The world celebrates but Carl Jenkins, the Roughnecks psychic believes the Queen is alive on Earth. At Carl's urging the Roughnecks enter deepest darkest suburbia to prove the bug menace remains. Sadly Jenkins is correct, the Queen is on Earth and our home becomes the last battlefield. The war does not go well, and the Roughnecks are in the thick of it. The squad suffers a terrible loss and must find a way to stay together to continue the fight.This DVD is a triumph and disappointment. The stories in this chapter are surprisingly adult and poignant, as the squad deals with death, self-doubt, and uncertainty. The CGI work done primarily by Foundation Imaging is some of the best of the series (watch for the fighter plane flyover of Hawaii) The disappointment is that the end of the story is uncertain.

In my opinion, the climax to these episodes was worth the wait, too. While following the Troopers through all the other systems was fun (Tophet and Klenda being the other highpoints), the battle for Earth really took the proverbial cake. Bugs and our home sweet globe, two forces that should (and finally did) confront one another, lead to some awesome scenery and, more importantly, a change in the way the cartoon has been going.

While the series is great overall, I was underwhelmed with this installment.I think one problem with the Homefront is that with the other ones you can sort of explain having smaller tactical squads and thus fewer people, but when you get to Earth you can't really explain why there's almost no population running around.  You especially notice the lack of population in San Francisco.  It's not a major point, but it detracts a little from the atmosphere.  Also minor, the civilians who actually are shown seem more like those from a small Midwestern town than The City.The same good stuff is still in here as the other campaign.  The animation is top notch.  The dialog is pretty good and you really get to like the characters.  There's just something really cool about a squad of soldiers taking on hordes of monsters.  There is your usual nobody runs out of ammo and enemy fire never hits the heros stuff, but who cares?  It's quite an enjoyable set of episodes.Minor Spoiler Below-------------------The plots don't feel quite as interesting as theTesca Campaign (VHS)ones.  I also found parts to be just unbelievable.
