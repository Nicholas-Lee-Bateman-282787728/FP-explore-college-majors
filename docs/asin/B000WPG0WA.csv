The hands can move together, in opposition, in small or large circles, across the drum, straight down, on the rim, the metal end of the brush can be used to move across a cymbal for another effect ...the list goes on.I bought the DVD as I decided I wanted to add the ability to play brushes to my list of accomplishments and it is indeed a challange.The best part of the DVD is the breaking down of sections into different sorts and speeds of tempo.Some of the interviews are not as illuminating - sometimes it's just best to play, not talk. In fact, it is this element that limits the effectiveness of the presentation. Sometimes the beauty of something can be removed or lessened by talking about and dissecting it. Steve Smith is like a musical coroner - he simply has to take things apart and comes across as a little obsessive.Perhaps the insistent questioning of the players shows something that is indefinable about music - it does not always come off well and one can see that there has been quick editing done to partially hide the fact that the conversation was not going anywhere constructive.The only complaint is that a modern brush master such as Jeff Hamilton is only featured briefly. One hopes he will be making an instructional DVD of his own soon - his profile is certainly high enough.Then again, perhaps he has a different sort of integrity and prefers to let his playing do the talking.As I am currently in the process of trying to play with the brushes myself, this DVD has helped immensely. The more you use the brushes, the more you will have the chance to make them respond accurately and make quicker movements if required. Only last night I was playing them and thought of the wires as fish tails, darting backwards and forwards - sometimes you need to try something for a while before becoming comfortable. I'm still in the process of becoming comfortable, especially with very slow and faster tempos.Overall, it is a very educational and inspiring DVD, which is what I want from this type of expensive product.I hope all older players receive royalties on sales.Again though, Hudson has NO SUBTITLES for international, non English speaking players. Here's hoping they fix that one day - it is a recurring omission. I brought it to their attention an an email once and received an automated reply saying they would get back to me, however that never happened.",5,The range of styles of techniques shown is incredible,1271980800,"04 23, 2010",2010,2632,"[""'The"", 'Art', 'Playing', 'Brushes', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'called', 'lost', 'art', ""brushes'.One"", 'hardly', 'people', 'using', 'nowadays', 'mostly', 'jazz', 'playing.I', 'am', 'amazed', 'different', 'ways', 'people', 'can', 'use', 'two', 'things', 'color', 'music', 'hands', 'can', 'move', 'together', 'opposition', 'small', 'large', 'circles', 'drum', 'straight', 'down', 'rim', 'metal', 'end', 'brush', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'move', 'cymbal', 'effect', 'list', 'on.I', 'bought', 'DVD', 'decided', 'wanted', 'add', 'ability', 'play', 'brushes', 'list', 'accomplishments', 'indeed', 'challange.The', 'best', 'part', 'DVD', 'breaking', 'sections', 'different', 'sorts', 'speeds', 'tempo.Some', 'interviews', 'are', 'not', 'illuminating', 'just', 'best', 'play', 'not', 'talk', 'fact', 'element', 'effectiveness', 'presentation', 'beauty', 'something', 'can', 'be', 'removed', 'lessened', 'talking', 'dissecting', 'Steve', 'Smith', 'musical', 'coroner', 'simply', 'take', 'things', 'apart', 'across', 'little', 'obsessive.Perhaps', 'insistent', 'questioning', 'players', 'something', 'indefinable', 'music', 'not', 'always', 'come', 'off', 'well', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'been', 'quick', 'editing', 'done', 'partially', 'hide', 'fact', 'conversation', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'anywhere', 'constructive.The', 'only', 'complaint', 'modern', 'brush', 'master', 'such', 'Jeff', 'Hamilton', 'only', 'featured', 'briefly', 'One', 'will', 'be', 'making', 'instructional', 'DVD', 'own', 'soon', 'profile', 'certainly', 'high', 'enough.Then', 'again', 'perhaps', 'different', 'sort', 'integrity', 'prefers', 'let', 'playing', 'do', 'talking.As', 'am', 'currently', 'process', 'trying', 'play', 'brushes', 'DVD', 'helped', 'immensely', 'more', 'use', 'brushes', 'more', 'will', 'have', 'chance', 'make', 'respond', 'accurately', 'make', 'quicker', 'movements', 'required', 'Only', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'playing', 'thought', 'wires', 'fish', 'tails', 'darting', 'backwards', 'forwards', 'sometimes', 'need', 'try', 'something', 'while', 'becoming', 'comfortable', ""'m"", 'still', 'process', 'becoming', 'comfortable', 'especially', 'very', 'slow', 'faster', 'tempos.Overall', 'very', 'educational', 'inspiring', 'DVD', 'what', 'want', 'type', 'expensive', 'product.I', 'hope', 'older', 'players', 'receive', 'royalties', 'sales.Again', 'Hudson', 'NO', 'SUBTITLES', 'international', 'non', 'English', 'speaking', 'players', 'Here', 'hoping', 'fix', 'one', 'day', 'recurring', 'omission', 'brought', 'attention', 'email', 'once', 'received', 'automated', 'reply', 'saying', 'would', 'get', 'back', 'however', 'never', 'happened']",N/A

1111212,A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y,B000WPG0WA,"Mike Tarrani ""Jazz Drummer""","[1, 1]","Pardon my use of trite metaphors, but I view the three brushwork instructional videos as Vocabulary (Ed Thigpen'sThe Essence of Brushes (DVD), this DVD, which would fall under creative writing, and Clayton Cameron'sClayton Cameron: Brushworks - The DVD, which I view as a thesaurus.Where Ed Thigpen's The Essence of Brushes (DVD) provided the basic foundation in the form of a vocabulary, this DVD set liberates you in ways that allow you to creatively employ Mr. Thigpen's approach, and shows how you can imprint your style on music when playing brushes.The many hours I spent with Ed's DVD gave me the confidence to play brushes in a musical setting, but I was worrying more about remaining faithful to Ed's lessons and approach than I was about letting the music move me to take chances and play more about how I felt. In many ways I was too rigid (in mindset), believing that Ed Thigpen represented the canonical. Of course, this was more a self-imposed limitation because Ed stressed finding your sound repeatedly. I didn't take that part of the lesson to heart until Misters Smith and Nussbaum pulled together some of the best living brush players and made The Art of Playing with Brushes a reality.Here I watched some of the greats tackle the same songs is vastly different ways. It was an eye opener because none of them sounded a thing like Ed, but each of them brought the songs alive. Before I had gotten half way through the first disc I had an epiphany about what it means to put your personal touch on playing of any kind, even if it means breaking with some self-imposed set of conventions.The artists who performed and demonstrated on this DVD are Joe Morello, Charli Persip, Eddie Locke, Billy Hart and Ben Riley. Same songs, including slow and faster tempos, and a Latin piece for each of them. Results: so totally different that I was inspired to play along to the accompanying CD before I was anywhere near through with the DVD set. It was liberating and I felt as though the vocabulary that Ed gave me was now ready to be used in other ways to creatively write (in a figurative sense, of course.) And creatively write I did. One set by Billy Hart was especially inspiring because he was actually doing quarter notes on his bass drum when conventional wisdom would have dictated otherwise. And it worked!While two DVDs filled with demonstrations by some of the greatest drummers alive today, and a play-along CD earn this set a significant value point, the booklet that comes with it adds even more value. All too often we never take the time to read booklets that come with DVDs (unless in a fit of boredom), but the accompanying booklet is not only fascinating, but also essential reading by any drummer who wants to extend the contents of the discs and CD into deeper thinking and a deeper understanding of brush playing.Most of the booklet was written by Mark Griffith who is an extraordinary writer and historian, among other talents. Highlights of the booklet [for me] were A History of the Brushes that fills in gaps in other resources and includes some provocative material about the relationship between tap dancing and brushes, and the early brush masters. He extended the relationship discussion with a brief history of tap dancing. Also important is Mark's brush resource guide that covers selected artists and songs to which you should pay attention.One omission from the set is a collection of PDF files that were supposed to be on the DVD set. However, you can obtain them by going to Hudson Music's product page, which contains a link that will allow you to download the missing files.",5,Creative Writing,1335052800,"04 22, 2012",2012,3621,"['Pardon', 'use', 'trite', 'metaphors', 'view', 'three', 'brushwork', 'instructional', 'videos', 'Vocabulary', 'Ed', ""Thigpen'sThe"", 'Essence', 'Brushes', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'would', 'fall', 'creative', 'writing', 'Clayton', ""Cameron'sClayton"", 'Cameron', 'Brushworks', 'DVD', 'view', 'thesaurus.Where', 'Ed', 'Thigpen', 'Essence', 'Brushes', 'DVD', 'provided', 'basic', 'foundation', 'form', 'vocabulary', 'DVD', 'set', 'liberates', 'ways', 'allow', 'creatively', 'employ', 'Mr.', 'Thigpen', 'approach', 'how', 'can', 'imprint', 'style', 'music', 'when', 'playing', 'brushes.The', 'many', 'hours', 'spent', 'Ed', 'DVD', 'gave', 'confidence', 'play', 'brushes', 'musical', 'setting', 'was', 'worrying', 'more', 'remaining', 'faithful', 'Ed', 'lessons', 'approach', 'was', 'letting', 'music', 'move', 'take', 'chances', 'play', 'more', 'how', 'felt', 'many', 'ways', 'was', 'too', 'rigid', 'mindset', 'believing', 'Ed', 'Thigpen', 'represented', 'canonical', 'course', 'was', 'more', 'self-imposed', 'limitation', 'Ed', 'stressed', 'finding', 'sound', 'repeatedly', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'part', 'lesson', 'heart', 'Misters', 'Smith', 'Nussbaum', 'pulled', 'together', 'best', 'living', 'brush', 'players', 'made', 'Art', 'Playing', 'Brushes', 'reality.Here', 'watched', 'greats', 'tackle', 'same', 'songs', 'vastly', 'different', 'ways', 'was', 'eye', 'opener', 'none', 'sounded', 'thing', 'Ed', 'brought', 'songs', 'alive', 'had', 'gotten', 'half', 'way', 'first', 'disc', 'had', 'epiphany', 'what', 'put', 'personal', 'touch', 'playing', 'kind', 'even', 'breaking', 'self-imposed', 'set', 'conventions.The', 'artists', 'who', 'performed', 'demonstrated', 'DVD', 'are', 'Joe', 'Morello', 'Charli', 'Persip', 'Eddie', 'Locke', 'Billy', 'Hart', 'Ben', 'Riley', 'Same', 'songs', 'including', 'slow', 'faster', 'tempos', 'Latin', 'piece', 'Results', 'so', 'totally', 'different', 'was', 'inspired', 'play', 'along', 'accompanying', 'CD', 'was', 'anywhere', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'liberating', 'felt', 'vocabulary', 'Ed', 'gave', 'was', 'now', 'ready', 'be', 'used', 'other', 'ways', 'creatively', 'write', 'figurative', 'sense', 'course', 'creatively', 'write', 'did', 'One', 'set', 'Billy', 'Hart', 'was', 'especially', 'inspiring', 'was', 'actually', 'doing', 'quarter', 'notes', 'bass', 'drum', 'when', 'conventional', 'wisdom', 'would', 'have', 'dictated', 'otherwise', 'worked', 'two', 'DVDs', 'filled', 'demonstrations', 'greatest', 'drummers', 'alive', 'today', 'play-along', 'CD', 'earn', 'set', 'significant', 'value', 'point', 'booklet', 'even', 'more', 'value', 'All', 'too', 'often', 'never', 'take', 'time', 'read', 'booklets', 'come', 'DVDs', 'fit', 'boredom', 'accompanying', 'booklet', 'not', 'only', 'fascinating', 'also', 'essential', 'reading', 'drummer', 'who', 'extend', 'contents', 'discs', 'CD', 'deeper', 'thinking', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'brush', 'playing.Most', 'booklet', 'was', 'written', 'Mark', 'Griffith', 'who', 'extraordinary', 'writer', 'historian', 'other', 'talents', 'Highlights', 'booklet', '[', ']', 'were', 'A', 'History', 'Brushes', 'gaps', 'other', 'resources', 'provocative', 'material', 'relationship', 'tap', 'dancing', 'brushes', 'early', 'brush', 'masters', 'extended', 'relationship', 'discussion', 'brief', 'history', 'tap', 'dancing', 'Also', 'important', 'Mark', 'brush', 'resource', 'guide', 'selected', 'artists', 'songs', 'should', 'pay', 'attention.One', 'omission', 'set', 'collection', 'PDF', 'files', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'DVD', 'set', 'However', 'can', 'obtain', 'going', 'Hudson', 'Music', 'product', 'page', 'link', 'will', 'allow', 'download', 'missing', 'files']",N/A
