Are gay men so desperate for gay films that we're willing to pander such bunk to unsuspecting viewers?  I try to view as many gay films as possible, as I feel that I owe it to those who felt the need to represent me and my fellow gay men in some way, shape or form.  But, I surely won't praise or recommend a film simply because it is gay.  I've never seen a film so over-estimated in my life.  I've seen five star gay films...Angels in America, Soldier's Girl, Beautiful Thing.  Murder in Portland SURELY isn't one of them.I read a review that praised this film for what they were able to do with such a small budget($50,000).  But there simply is not a point in the film where it isn't apparent that the budget was miniscule.  The camera shots are sloppy.  The acting is rank.  The sound is of poor quality.  And, I've read better scripts from my undergrad screenwriting students.  Just because the producers of this film may have done more with it than the small budget would typically allow doesn't make this film good or worth watching.  And...if the script was good and the actor's better than VERY SUB-PAR, would it really matter what the budget was?As many have indicated, the lead ""cop"" was hot.  I found him beautiful...but I can flip through any magazine or watch thousands of other good films and be much happier for it.  A hot actor does not a movie make.I crave good gay entertainment.  We are a very misrepresented population in the big screen and the small screen.  I praise actors and directors with the courage and gall to make their voices heard and produce gay work.  But, gay or not, I'm not going to recommend this film simply because it is gay.  We deserve better than that...and recommending it for it's sexual bent would only perpetuate mediocrity in a medium that has potential for so much more.",1,What you talkin' bout Willis?,1088121600,"06 25, 2004",2004,1950,"['films', 'are', 'not', 'plastic', 'are', 'packaged', 'five', 'star', 'ratings', ""'m"", 'reading', 'just', 'baffle', 'Are', 'gay', 'men', 'so', 'desperate', 'gay', 'films', ""'re"", 'willing', 'pander', 'such', 'bunk', 'unsuspecting', 'viewers', 'try', 'view', 'many', 'gay', 'films', 'possible', 'feel', 'owe', 'who', 'felt', 'need', 'represent', 'fellow', 'gay', 'men', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'surely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'praise', 'recommend', 'film', 'simply', 'gay', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'so', 'over-estimated', 'life', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'five', 'star', 'gay', 'films', 'Angels', 'America', 'Soldier', 'Girl', 'Beautiful', 'Thing', 'Murder', 'Portland', 'SURELY', ""n't"", 'one', 'them.I', 'read', 'review', 'praised', 'film', 'what', 'were', 'able', 'do', 'small', 'budget', '50,000', 'simply', 'not', 'point', 'film', 'where', ""n't"", 'apparent', 'budget', 'was', 'miniscule', 'camera', 'shots', 'are', 'sloppy', 'acting', 'rank', 'sound', 'poor', 'quality', ""'ve"", 'read', 'better', 'scripts', 'undergrad', 'screenwriting', 'students', 'Just', 'producers', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'small', 'budget', 'would', 'typically', 'allow', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'good', 'worth', 'watching', 'script', 'was', 'good', 'actor', 'better', 'VERY', 'SUB-PAR', 'would', 'really', 'matter', 'what', 'budget', 'was', 'many', 'have', 'indicated', 'lead', 'cop', 'was', 'hot', 'found', 'beautiful', 'can', 'flip', 'magazine', 'watch', 'thousands', 'other', 'good', 'films', 'be', 'much', 'happier', 'hot', 'actor', 'not', 'movie', 'make.I', 'crave', 'good', 'gay', 'entertainment', 'are', 'very', 'misrepresented', 'population', 'big', 'screen', 'small', 'screen', 'praise', 'actors', 'directors', 'courage', 'gall', 'make', 'voices', 'heard', 'produce', 'gay', 'work', 'not', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'recommend', 'film', 'simply', 'gay', 'deserve', 'better', 'recommending', 'sexual', 'bent', 'would', 'only', 'perpetuate', 'mediocrity', 'medium', 'potential', 'so', 'much', 'more']",N/A

I watched ""Murder"" first and then, in a single afternoon, the first two as well. Their formula varies little, and includes: unusually cute young men (at least one of whom is troubled, new in town, and/or needs help); a sex scene or two (in the context of loving partners); a variety of characters of all ages and persuasions (their apparent use of street people is reminiscent of Gus Van Sant); a healthy dose of sex-ed and gay politics; good music.  It works. The stories are interesting (even touching), the characters are winning (often beautiful), and the endings are positive.""Murder"" centers around a young and extraordinarily handsome 'straight' cop (not credited by role so I don't know his name, malheureusement), who is recruited to investigate the killing of two gay men.  To say he learns MUCH about the gay community he infiltrates would be rather a zenith in understatement.  Suffice it to say, he is dedicated to his work and goes 'under cover' in more ways than one to solve the crime.All the RAF films have plenty to offer if you just look beyond their low-budget parameters and drink in the actors, characters, stories, and message. I can't wait for the next one, along with the pleasure of a sweet, funny, character-driven movie in this age of macho, jingoistic nonsense.",4,Olympian effort,1058227200,"07 15, 2003",2003,1343,"['three', 'RAF', 'films', 'take', 'place', 'Olympia', 'WA', 'watched', 'Murder', 'first', 'then', 'single', 'afternoon', 'first', 'two', 'as', 'well', 'formula', 'little', 'unusually', 'cute', 'young', 'men', 'least', 'one', 'whom', 'troubled', 'new', 'town', 'and/or', 'needs', 'help', 'sex', 'scene', 'two', 'context', 'loving', 'partners', 'variety', 'characters', 'ages', 'persuasions', 'apparent', 'use', 'street', 'people', 'reminiscent', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'healthy', 'dose', 'sex-ed', 'gay', 'politics', 'good', 'music', 'stories', 'are', 'interesting', 'even', 'touching', 'characters', 'are', 'winning', 'often', 'beautiful', 'endings', 'are', 'positive', 'Murder', 'centers', 'young', 'extraordinarily', 'handsome', ""'straight"", 'cop', 'not', 'credited', 'role', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'name', 'malheureusement', 'who', 'recruited', 'investigate', 'killing', 'two', 'gay', 'men', 'say', 'learns', 'MUCH', 'gay', 'community', 'would', 'be', 'rather', 'zenith', 'understatement', 'Suffice', 'say', 'dedicated', 'work', ""'under"", 'cover', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'solve', 'crime.All', 'RAF', 'films', 'have', 'plenty', 'offer', 'just', 'look', 'low-budget', 'parameters', 'drink', 'actors', 'characters', 'stories', 'message', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'next', 'one', 'pleasure', 'sweet', 'funny', 'character-driven', 'movie', 'age', 'macho', 'jingoistic', 'nonsense']",N/A

A young boy runs away from his religiously homophobic father, traumatized by a tragic event from his childhood, leaving him emotionally scarred and mute. When he arrives in Olympia, he communicates through writing, just like the first two, a town member meets and befriends him, and you guessed it...they fall in love. I've seen homophobia strongly long down on before, but these films took it to a level I haven't seen since Wolfe video's The Big Eden. Through therapy and patience, the mute boy learns to cope with his past trauma, in a very heartwarming moment...it made me want to cry too!
