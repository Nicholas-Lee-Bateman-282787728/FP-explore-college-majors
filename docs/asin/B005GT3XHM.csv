1460599,A3R7PQAHD3NZM0,B005GT3XHM,Autumn Blues Reviews,"[2, 3]","I will have to be honest and say that the funniest parts of The Heart Specialist are not the short stand-up comedy bits in the film. That part of this film is quite awful as the stand-up comedy was not funny at all. This film had it's funny moments and it had it's nice moments and it had it's sad moments. I can highly agree it is a heartwarming movie and you really need to pay attention to the movie if you want to know what is going on. This is not your traditional brother and sister film with loads of laughter. I believe this movie is a better mix with the older crowd and those with a more laid-back attitude. This film is for those that don't feel every movie moment needs to be hysterical to be a comedy, and if not, then it is no not good enough to watch. The host of characters was refreshing, and although not a main character, who cannot but love Marla Gibbs from the Jefferson's as a supporting actress in this film, as she flirts with the good looking doctors. The plot of this movie centers around Ray (Brain White), his supervisor Dr. Sidney Zachary (Wood Harris), and Dr. Zachary's girlfriend nurse Donna (Zoe Saldana). Ray is the womanizer of the physicians and Dr. Zachary and his girlfriend Donna seem to have a more casual relationship then lovers, although they are living together. This was one thing that left me confused at times, but if you hang on and watch the movie until the end, you find out why their relationship is the way it is. This revelation is a mix of sadness and enlightenment that will leave you glad you watched the film to the end. I am giving this film 3 stars as it could have been a better film if the comedy bits had been left out, except for maybe one which told us Dr. Zachary also moon-lighted as a comic. Instead bringing in more drama from outside the hospital would have made the movie more interesting.",3,What this film lacks in comedy it makes up for with  great actors and it's heartwarming appeal.,1323648000,"12 12, 2011",2011,1859,"['will', 'have', 'be', 'honest', 'say', 'funniest', 'parts', 'Heart', 'Specialist', 'are', 'not', 'short', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'bits', 'film', 'part', 'film', 'quite', 'awful', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'was', 'not', 'funny', 'film', 'had', 'funny', 'moments', 'had', 'nice', 'moments', 'had', 'sad', 'moments', 'can', 'highly', 'agree', 'heartwarming', 'movie', 'really', 'need', 'pay', 'attention', 'movie', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'not', 'traditional', 'brother', 'sister', 'film', 'loads', 'laughter', 'believe', 'movie', 'better', 'mix', 'older', 'crowd', 'more', 'laid-back', 'attitude', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'movie', 'moment', 'be', 'hysterical', 'be', 'comedy', 'not', 'then', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'watch', 'host', 'characters', 'was', 'refreshing', 'not', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'love', 'Marla', 'Gibbs', 'Jefferson', 'supporting', 'actress', 'film', 'good', 'looking', 'doctors', 'plot', 'movie', 'Ray', 'Brain', 'White', 'supervisor', 'Dr.', 'Sidney', 'Zachary', 'Wood', 'Harris', 'Dr.', 'Zachary', 'girlfriend', 'nurse', 'Donna', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'Ray', 'womanizer', 'physicians', 'Dr.', 'Zachary', 'girlfriend', 'Donna', 'seem', 'have', 'more', 'casual', 'relationship', 'then', 'lovers', 'are', 'living', 'together', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'left', 'confused', 'times', 'hang', 'watch', 'movie', 'end', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'relationship', 'way', 'revelation', 'mix', 'sadness', 'enlightenment', 'will', 'leave', 'glad', 'watched', 'film', 'end', 'am', 'giving', 'film', '3', 'stars', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'film', 'comedy', 'bits', 'had', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'maybe', 'one', 'told', 'Dr.', 'Zachary', 'also', 'moon-lighted', 'comic', 'Instead', 'bringing', 'more', 'drama', 'hospital', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'more', 'interesting']","Heart Specialist, The"
1460600,A1XI5UAJE5Z6KN,B005GT3XHM,bordersj2,"[5, 5]","I'm honestly not too surprised that some found this movie a little slow.  It doesn't follow what seems to be the standard cliche for ""African American"" comedy dramas, IMO.  That is, absurd drama, stereotypes, a measure of preaching and even more over-the-top drama followed up with an illogical ending all the while with sprinkles of black culture throughout and slapstick.  While there was admittedly some level of 'preach' here, it wasn't so different than any other movie and I felt it was well done in the various subtle ways due ot the characters' interaction.I will try not to give too many spoilers away but warn that I might, so you may want to skip to the end of the review if you don't want to know too much.  The synopsis was already well described, the main characters are Ray, Donna and Dr. Zachary (Sidney), played by Brian White (JoJo White's son!), Zoe Saldana and Wood Harris.  The story is about a young doctor trying to find his way - and the pieces of his heart - after following it to an under-funded hospital in Florida.  In the aftermath, he learns quite a bit about heart, people, love and maybe most importantly, taking himself so seriously.  Who you originally think could be the main character of the movie ends up not really being the one - though it's hard to argue against the person being the most important in the movie. In the end I too have to admit, it takes a dramatic turn that actually makes sense but still (spoiler.... warning....) leaves you reflecting on the characters.I actually really liked this movie but then again I'm a fan of Wood Harris.  He comes across as extremely down to Earth in this role like he did in ""Remember The Titan's"" and does a fantastic job with the material.  Though comedy was probably branching out for him, he held his own.  Zoe was charming as well and Brian White played her part very nicely too.  But in the end it was Wood Harris' delivery as Dr. Zachary that really delivered and perhaps the most special moment of the movie came at the most dramatic - to me at least.  The characters come across as very real, not necessarily the pedestal's in Hollywood film.  To buy the movie may be a stretch and I'd say if you're looking for an enthralling, dramatic stereotyped movie you'll be disappointed.  It does however make me look forward to Wood's portrayal of Sweetwater in a year or two.  Oh - and it was good to see Scott Paulin (ER) here, Method Mad had a cameo and Mya was on briefly as well.",4,I Liked It,1321401600,"11 16, 2011",2011,2470,"[""'m"", 'honestly', 'not', 'too', 'surprised', 'found', 'movie', 'little', 'slow', ""n't"", 'follow', 'what', 'be', 'standard', 'cliche', 'African', 'American', 'comedy', 'dramas', 'IMO', 'absurd', 'drama', 'stereotypes', 'measure', 'preaching', 'even', 'more', 'over-the-top', 'drama', 'followed', 'up', 'illogical', 'ending', 'while', 'sprinkles', 'black', 'culture', 'slapstick', 'was', 'admittedly', 'level', ""'preach"", 'here', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'different', 'other', 'movie', 'felt', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'various', 'subtle', 'ways', 'due', 'characters', 'interaction.I', 'will', 'try', 'not', 'give', 'too', 'many', 'spoilers', 'away', 'warn', 'might', 'may', 'want', 'skip', 'end', 'review', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'too', 'much', 'synopsis', 'was', 'already', 'well', 'described', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'Ray', 'Donna', 'Dr.', 'Zachary', 'Sidney', 'played', 'Brian', 'White', 'JoJo', 'White', 'son', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'Wood', 'Harris', 'story', 'young', 'doctor', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'pieces', 'heart', 'following', 'under-funded', 'hospital', 'Florida', 'aftermath', 'quite', 'bit', 'heart', 'people', 'love', 'maybe', 'most', 'importantly', 'taking', 'so', 'seriously', 'Who', 'originally', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'main', 'character', 'movie', 'up', 'not', 'really', 'being', 'one', 'hard', 'argue', 'person', 'being', 'most', 'important', 'movie', 'end', 'too', 'have', 'admit', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'actually', 'sense', 'still', 'spoiler', 'warning', 'reflecting', 'characters.I', 'actually', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'then', 'again', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Wood', 'Harris', 'extremely', 'Earth', 'role', 'did', 'Remember', 'Titan', 'fantastic', 'job', 'material', 'comedy', 'was', 'probably', 'branching', 'out', 'held', 'own', 'Zoe', 'was', 'charming', 'as', 'well', 'Brian', 'White', 'played', 'part', 'very', 'nicely', 'too', 'end', 'was', 'Wood', 'Harris', 'delivery', 'Dr.', 'Zachary', 'really', 'delivered', 'perhaps', 'most', 'special', 'moment', 'movie', 'came', 'most', 'dramatic', 'least', 'characters', 'come', 'very', 'real', 'not', 'necessarily', 'pedestal', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'buy', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'stretch', ""'d"", 'say', ""'re"", 'looking', 'enthralling', 'dramatic', 'stereotyped', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'however', 'make', 'look', 'forward', 'Wood', 'portrayal', 'Sweetwater', 'year', 'two', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'Scott', 'Paulin', 'ER', 'here', 'Method', 'Mad', 'had', 'cameo', 'Mya', 'was', 'briefly', 'as', 'well']","Heart Specialist, The"
1460601,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B005GT3XHM,Chris Pandolfi,"[9, 11]","""The Heart Specialist"" is about a doctor that doesn't play by the rules, views life a little differently than everyone else, and imparts his years of wisdom on those he deems worthy. I'm talking about Sidney Zachary (Wood Harris), the chief resident of a less than prestigious South Florida hospital. He's been quietly keeping watch over the first year residents for quite some time, and has been recording his observations on a mini cassette machine. His girlfriend, Donna (Zoe Saldana), types his words, helping him along on his goal towards becoming the next Michael Crichton. He also jokes about what he sees at a local comedy club, which is part of his funded experiment to prove that laughter really is the best medicine.He takes under his wing Ray Howard (Brian J. White), a Harvard graduate, a first-year intern, and a perpetual ladies man who can't make a commitment. He's also cold and distant from his patients, a professional man who refuses to get into their personal lives. This doesn't sit well with Zachary, who was trained in Mexico and sometimes goes by Dr. Z. He learned everything he needed to know by making those emotional connections. Through cryptic passages of dialogue and reliably eccentric behaviors, he will take it upon himself to teach the young doctor how life should really be lived. He considers himself little more than a teacher's guide, but isn't that more or less how all self-appointed mentors see themselves?I understand and appreciate what ""The Heart Specialist"" is trying to tell me, but I see no reason why it couldn't have been told with some style. Watching this movie play out is a little like watching a movie-of-the week on cable; it looks cheap, has a limited number of settings and camera setups, specific shots seem like padding, and is saddled with a story that's rote, sappy, and predictable. The only way it breaks with tradition is that it features a relatively large cast, with Ma, Jenifer Lewis, Method Man, Jasmine Guy, and even Ed Asner all making appearances at one point or another. They must have thought there was something worthwhile, here; maybe I'm being silly, but I'd like to think some actors are motivated by more than a paycheck.Much of the problem stems from writer/director Dennis Cooper's inability to decide on a tone. The film, intended as both a comedy and a drama, often times veers too far into both genres. Sometimes, he makes light of situations that are clearly not funny. Case in point: Marla Gibbs as Ms. Overwood, an aging bipolar patient who intentionally stops taking her lithium just so that she will be taken to the hospital. This is a serious problem, and yet Cooper reduces this character to comedy relief; she's a bawdy and badly dressed nymphomaniac who hits on all the male doctors, including Howard, much to his chagrin. Is there something about this woman that I simply didn't see?She exemplifies the broad humor with which this film falls back on. Consider the moments Zachary's stand-up material plays out visually, like when a big, gangsta-looking man cries like a baby at the prospect of getting a prostate exam. Part of what makes stand-up so entertaining, I believe, is that it requires the audience to use their imaginations. Other scenes are just plain bizarre, like when Howard falls asleep and has a sexual fantasy about Donna; in the annuls of sexual fantasies, I've never heard of one in which the man has an emotional epiphany and then actually refrains from having sex. Come on, Dennis. You should know that dreams don't work like this, not even in the movies.Now let's go to the other end of the genre spectrum. Characters like Dr. Zachary are bound by a convention so overused that it has lost all ability to generate within me an emotional reaction. What was once heartfelt is now contrived and manipulative. The drama of Zachary's personal mission is second only to his antagonistic relationship with Dr. Graves (Scott Paulin), a bitter old man who's mean to all the interns and thinks he's entitled to more money and respect. Characters like this add drama to the story without adding substance; their primary purpose is to make trouble for the leads to have the satisfaction of working through. Graves' one-dimensional nature is exacerbated by his sidekick, an unnecessary and buffoonish German caricature played by David S. Lee.Other characters, like the perpetually anxious intern Mitchell Kwan (Kenneth Choi) and Howard's ex-girlfriend (Ma), are completely unnecessary and contribute absolutely nothing, apart from an excuse for frivolous subplots. I suppose the message of ""The Heart Specialist"" is a good one, although one we've heard many times before, and usually in films that at least make an effort with its characters, plot, and balancing of tone. Maybe Cooper would have been better off making this into a movie-of-the-week; at least then, most audiences would have the chance to manage their expectations a bit.  If not for the rising star power of Zoe Saldana, this probably would have never seen a theatrical release. Sometimes, I'm amazed at the films that find their way into theaters.",3,Laughter Isn't Always the Best Medicine,1295568000,"01 21, 2011",2011,5118,"['Heart', 'Specialist', 'doctor', ""n't"", 'play',

It really was not that bad at all and great casting to.",3,not bad,1365379200,"04 8, 2013",2013,562,"['only', 'was', 'interested', 'movie', 'Brian', 'White', 'Based', 'previews', 'seen', 'made', 'movie', 'look', 'horrible', 'When', 'decided', 'watch', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'storyline', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'either', 'liked', 'Wood', 'Harris', 'performance', 'Zoe', 'Saldana.I', 'actually', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'horrible', 'was', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'funny', 'basically', 'young', 'doctor', 'Wood', 'Harris', 'running', 'hospital', 'Marla', 'Gibbs', 'was', 'also', 'funny.People', 'should', 'really', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', 'really', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'great', 'casting']","Heart Specialist, The"
