528290,A3W4GJR5CCADBX,B00003CXKR,"""50cent-haircut""","[2, 3]","The film received plaudits at Cannes and deservedly so. Not many films these days tackle so much with candor and integrity as Lars von Trier's films do. As a Dogma director, von Trier stubbornly wields a handheld and refuses cheesy soundtrack, but he inserts musical set scenes that are beautiful and fascinating to behold. It also gives Bjork a chance to let loose.Bjork's performance is impressive to say the least. She puts her shrill idiosyncrasies as a music perhormer on hold, and gives a measured, pitch-perfect performance as a woman who is losing her vision, her life and her grip on the reality.Lars von Trier likes to tackle big, metaphysical themes, and he's most adept at blurring the line between reality and the metaphysical realm. He was more expressionistic in his earlier post-modern flicks such as 'Zentropa'. But with his allegiance to Dogma, he has cut down on the lavishly produced qualities. The sister film of 'Dancer...' is the film that preceded it: the excellent 'Breaking the Waves,' which also deals with a downfall of a good, pure-hearted woman.However, whereas 'Breaking the Waves' weaved the Christ metaphor onto the story of its heroine effortlessly, in 'Dancer in the Dark', the mechanisms of the storytelling become conscious entities, and seem like artifice that intrude upon the arc of the story. The musical numbers, as beautiful and exuberant as they are, take us out of the realm of Selma's world too suddenly. Not enough subtlety.It is worth mentioning the stories that von Trier tell are emphatically melodramatic in nature. In this film, a blind mother tries to save her son, but through injustice of the world, faces death herself. It is a testament to Mr. von Trier's craftsmanship that this story, which can turn into a ball of kitsch in the hands of a lesser man, is told without a trace of sentimentality. It's a haunting film that won't leave you unaffected.",4,Another stellar film from the Dogma director von Trier,996624000,"08 1, 2001",2001,1907,"['film', 'received', 'plaudits', 'Cannes', 'deservedly', 'so', 'Not', 'many', 'films', 'days', 'tackle', 'so', 'much', 'candor', 'integrity', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'films', 'do', 'Dogma', 'director', 'von', 'Trier', 'stubbornly', 'handheld', 'cheesy', 'soundtrack', 'musical', 'set', 'scenes', 'are', 'beautiful', 'fascinating', 'behold', 'also', 'Bjork', 'chance', 'let', 'loose.Bjork', 'performance', 'impressive', 'say', 'least', 'shrill', 'idiosyncrasies', 'music', 'perhormer', 'hold', 'measured', 'pitch-perfect', 'performance', 'woman', 'who', 'losing', 'vision', 'life', 'grip', 'reality.Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'likes', 'tackle', 'big', 'metaphysical', 'themes', 'most', 'adept', 'blurring', 'line', 'reality', 'metaphysical', 'realm', 'was', 'more', 'expressionistic', 'earlier', 'post-modern', 'flicks', 'such', ""'Zentropa"", 'allegiance', 'Dogma', 'cut', 'down', 'lavishly', 'produced', 'qualities', 'sister', 'film', ""'Dancer"", 'film', 'preceded', 'excellent', ""'Breaking"", 'Waves', 'also', 'downfall', 'good', 'pure-hearted', 'woman.However', ""'Breaking"", 'Waves', 'weaved', 'Christ', 'metaphor', 'story', 'heroine', 'effortlessly', ""'Dancer"", 'Dark', 'mechanisms', 'storytelling', 'become', 'conscious', 'entities', 'seem', 'artifice', 'intrude', 'arc', 'story', 'musical', 'numbers', 'beautiful', 'exuberant', 'are', 'take', 'realm', 'Selma', 'world', 'too', 'suddenly', 'Not', 'enough', 'subtlety.It', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'stories', 'von', 'Trier', 'tell', 'are', 'emphatically', 'melodramatic', 'nature', 'film', 'blind', 'mother', 'tries', 'save', 'son', 'injustice', 'world', 'death', 'testament', 'Mr.', 'von', 'Trier', 'craftsmanship', 'story', 'can', 'turn', 'ball', 'kitsch', 'hands', 'lesser', 'man', 'told', 'trace', 'sentimentality', 'haunting', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'unaffected']",N/A
528291,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B00003CXKR,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[7, 7]","By Lars von Trier, ('96 ""Breaking the Waves"") and  regarded as legendary gifted filmmaker.  What makes this unique controversial film like no other is the concept of a dark, sad, violent story sprinkled with fast toe stomping, high kicking, Hollywood musical numbers. It has been called a musical melodrama.  It is musically happy, emotionally sad, tragically violent and contains a gripping finale.Bjork convincingly portrays Selma Jezkova with child-like innocence, hardly seeming to be a mother of a 12 year-old. Her personality is placid and sweet. The ethereal sounds of her child-like voice might require some getting used to.  She can sing in a low whispery sometime squeaky breaking voice.Von Trier used the hand-held camera angles as originality, but that camera technique gives the movie an angle of a real live documentary, a style Von Trier intended.What proves even stranger in this melodrama is the way music is introduced and interspersed. Selma lives in her own world and it comes alive when the stress peaks. She escapes at the rhythmic sounds of the banging, pounding pipes against metal, and the hissing noises at the factory where she works making metal sinks. Quickly, Selma is swept into the Hollywood musicals she so loves. The kicker here is that anyone in the scene becomes part of her musical fantasy.Selma Yozkova shares a trailer home with her son Gene. Selma, going blind, works to save money for an operation that will save her son from the hereditary impending blindness.  One pleasure Selma has is seeing old musicals; her friend and coworker and friend Cathy (Catherine Daneuve) often becomes the eyes for Selma. Cathy and Selma perform evenings at the community theatre studying the ""Sound of Music."" In Selma's fantasy world, she also believes that in musicals, ""nothing dreadful ever happens.""What dreadfully happens in her real world is disturbing.  Here is where the series of events take a drastic turn. It is heart wrenching to see her struggle, not so much for her own life, but for the crucial operation for her son.The climax is extremely emotional. It is complex, morbid, touching, heartless, etc. See it! The movie is 2 and  hours, but you don't seem to notice the length.  See it for its originality. .....MzRizz",5,Originality!,1010966400,"01 14, 2002",2002,2258,"['Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'Breaking', 'Waves', 'regarded', 'legendary', 'gifted', 'filmmaker', 'What', 'unique', 'controversial', 'film', 'other', 'concept', 'dark', 'sad', 'violent', 'story', 'sprinkled', 'fast', 'toe', 'stomping', 'high', 'kicking', 'Hollywood', 'musical', 'numbers', 'been', 'called', 'musical', 'melodrama', 'musically', 'happy', 'emotionally', 'sad', 'tragically', 'violent', 'gripping', 'finale.Bjork', 'convincingly', 'Selma', 'Jezkova', 'child-like', 'innocence', 'hardly', 'seeming', 'be', 'mother', '12', 'year-old', 'personality', 'placid', 'sweet', 'ethereal', 'sounds', 'child-like', 'voice', 'might', 'require', 'getting', 'used', 'can', 'sing', 'low', 'whispery', 'sometime', 'squeaky', 'breaking', 'voice.Von', 'Trier', 'used', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'angles', 'originality', 'camera', 'technique', 'movie', 'angle', 'real', 'live', 'documentary', 'style', 'Von', 'Trier', 'intended.What', 'even', 'stranger', 'melodrama', 'way', 'music', 'introduced', 'interspersed', 'Selma', 'own', 'world', 'alive', 'when', 'stress', 'peaks', 'rhythmic', 'sounds', 'banging', 'pounding', 'pipes', 'metal', 'hissing', 'noises', 'factory', 'where', 'making', 'metal', 'sinks', 'Quickly', 'Selma', 'swept', 'Hollywood', 'musicals', 'so', 'kicker', 'here', 'anyone', 'scene', 'part', 'musical', 'fantasy.Selma', 'Yozkova', 'shares', 'trailer', 'home', 'son', 'Gene', 'Selma', 'going', 'blind', 'save', 'money', 'operation', 'will', 'save', 'son', 'hereditary', 'impending', 'blindness', 'One', 'pleasure', 'Selma', 'seeing', 'old', 'musicals', 'friend', 'coworker', 'friend', 'Cathy', 'Catherine', 'Daneuve', 'often', 'eyes', 'Selma', 'Cathy', 'Selma', 'perform', 'evenings', 'community', 'theatre', 'studying', 'Sound', 'Music', 'Selma', 'fantasy', 'world', 'also', 'musicals', 'nothing', 'dreadful', 'ever', 'What', 'dreadfully', 'real', 'world', 'disturbing', 'Here', 'where', 'series', 'events', 'take', 'drastic', 'turn', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'see', 'struggle', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'own', 'life', 'crucial', 'operation', 'son.The', 'climax', 'extremely', 'emotional', 'complex', 'morbid', 'touching', 'heartless', 'etc', 'See', 'movie', '2', 'hours', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'notice', 'length', 'See', 'originality', '..MzRizz']",N/A
528292,AQUU8S55JGY2H,B00003CXKR,Aco,"[6, 10]","This film's main character, Selma, played by Bjork was either a victim of the heavy hand of fate, or lost in a dream world of her own creation so much that she abandoned her son and let her life end far too early. Either way my sympathy for her was tested again and again, and now, after seeing Dancer in the Dark, after all the praise I heard and see written on this site, my sympathy for her is minor.What starts out as a fascinating, intimate sketching of several peoples connection to each other in Washington state in 1964 turns into a anger-enducing, logic stifling, aggravating exposure of a woman's elimination from society.Why the simple, poetic committment to Bill? (It sure wasn't mutual.) Was it love? Why the inability to express any argument to Bill's wife? (Especially for Jean's sake.) Why the lack of expression, for the sake of her son, of her predicament, in court, to Kathy, to Jeff? All of these actions, or lack of actions hindered her. Then, when the show is about to end, and she realizes she can't just leave the theatre she realizes the end. And her son is better off how? He might be able to see. See that he's alone, or has Jeff as a father? Not only did she not have to die, Bill didn't, she could have gotten the money back (hell, even put your arms out and feel if Bill is in the room, and wham, this is a different story) if she opened her mouth. In such dire circumstances, a woman whose most ecstatic state is opening her mouth to sing, couldn't even speak. Poetic, yes. Aggravation more so.To me, so much of Dancer in the Dark was unnecessary.

528294,ACG9G4B6B93AA,B00003CXKR,Adam A. Crane,"[7, 19]","A few caveats before the review:I had just read The God of Small Things, which is similarly infatuated/nostaligic about The Sound of Music. The Sound of Music was before my time: I do not have warm fuzzy feelings towards it: I'm sick of seeing it embedded in other fiction.(At this point, stop reading if you don't want to know how the film will end.)Second,as an American, I am probably reacting too emotionally to the way justice was dispensed. I am not be the best judge of what is a fair depiction of our legal system.If van Trier would have over-leapt the court room scenes, the lawyer scenes, and any interaction with the legal system, then we might have had a good movie. But he insisits on giving the Prosectution interminable minutes to make their case. On the other hand, Bjork's attorney is never shown saying anything. Bjork is put on the stand, grilled by Zeljko Ivanek as the Prosecution, with no explanation of why she is on the stand. Ivanek, a decent actor, seems to be used only because he looks like a sadist.Later Bjork gets a brand-spanking new lawyer who can get her off the hook. She cross-examines her lawyer to find where the money has come from; he cracks under the pressure, divulging the amount and thereby the source of the money. $2000 and change. When it comes to death penalty cases, $2000 will get your pulse checked to see if you are dead already; that's about it.There are, however, lawyers that take such cases pro bono. And let's see: blind young mother speaks English poorly--not an unattractive client for an attorney who has issues with the death penalty, oh no. And I submit is the only reason van Trier set the story in the United States is because the death penalty is still used here and thus Bjork can be made into an even bigger martyr.One other complaint: fiction that relies on fools not putting their money in a bank and then losing it or having it be stolen is at best unimaginative and desperate.I don't have any problem with the film technically. The jarring and the close-ups, which at times seem excessive, cumulatively have an undeniable power. The musical scenes fit well with how Selma deals with her world. I especially appreciated the opening scene of a painting being conceived, the growth and layering of colors.In short, I was very disappointed after being dazzled and shocked by Breaking the Waves.

528298,A1AHFIGBYPZTXC,B00003CXKR,Amazon Customer,"[2, 6]","Lars von Trier returns with another controversial episode in his very controversial career. In case you don't know who he is (and most people probably don't), Von Trier set out in his film career with an ambitious and self imposed regimen. His first three films, he proclaimed, would be all about flashy style and he went about making them exactly as he said. The last in that series, Zentropa, was especially well received. For his next three he would make it about the acting - no flashy camera work, no special effects, etc. The first in this trilogy was Breaking the Waves and met with much critical praise. The second is Dancer in the Dark and boy howdy has he made some people angry.You probably heard about Dancer and it's lead, Icelandic singer Bjork, winning the highest prize at Cannes this year over the catcalls of many critics in the audience. When I heard that, I thought maybe it was just Von Trier and his challenging style again that they were booing at. Breaking the Waves was an outstanding story shot in mostly natural light with the improvised quality of a home movie, and I loved it. Not for the crappy film quality, but for the story - many people have called it the most emotional film they've ever seen and I'd say it's certainly one of them. When I heard his next film was a musical with Bjork in it, I couldn't wait. Anyone who knows her will tell you that she has one of the most affecting voices in music today - it simply screams with emotion even when she's doing her little trademark squeaks and growls. And this is precisely the reason the film doesn't work.Bjork plays little Selma, a Czech immigrant working at an American factory making steel pots. She lives in a small room behind her landlord's house with her little boy and is slowly going blind from a genetic disorder. Knowing that her son will need an operation soon to save him from the same fate, she works double shifts to save money for him as well as doing odd jobs part time. Meanwhile, her girlfriend at the factory Kathy (Catherine Deneuve) takes her to the movie and narrates the action as well as watching over her at work to be sure no one notices that Selma is operating heavy machinery that she cannot see.To escape from all this, Selma dreams of Hollywood musicals and here is where Von Trier will catch you off guard. The factory sounds begin the first little musical interlude as clanking machines and riveters start the song and we're launched into a full blown, choreographed musical number under the most dank and oppressive lighting. It's magnificently unusual. Further escaping in to the world of the musical, Selma joins the cast of a local production of The Sound of Music and again Kathy winds up helping her hide the fact that she can't see the edge of the stage. In true Von Trier fashion, it's simply hopeless melodrama.That wouldn't be a bad thing in and of itself, but when things start going seriously wrong, Von Trier stretches the characters credibility to the breaking point. Selma's big hearted land lord Bill (David Morse, 'Brutal' from The Green Mile) winds up sharing his secrets with her one night and she quickly discovers herself in a situation in which she has to commit murder to save her son. Then the trial happens and Selma is once again trodden on - basically everything that can go wrong does. By the end of the film, we've seen so much of her bad luck that we just stopped believing in her as a real person. And that's the central failure of Dancer in the Dark.Bjork's musical numbers are so impassioned and so effective that it's a real shame Von Trier didn't just go whole hog with it - make an out and out musical. Then the melodrama wouldn't have mattered because we expect that in a musical. Her number on a railroad bridge where she can no longer hide the fact that she's blind, simply brought the house down. Dancing along a bridge and playfully falling on and off the passing train while she sings about having seen everything she needs to - it's just astounding. We were reduced to blubbering idiots after seeing that. Then by a later number in the theater where Selma says she loves musicals so much because &quot;there is always someone to catch me.&quot;In the end, though I like Von Trier very much, I have to say he made a misstep on this one. When you have a talent like Bjork, whose acting (though very admirable) will never compare to the power of her singing voice, you have to take advantage of it. The upshot of it all is that the non-musical portions of the film drag horrifically by comparison. By the time we come to the finale, we still don't find ourselves engaged by these characters partially due to the aforementioned weakness but mostly because they're simply not believable in a realistic setting. If Dancer in the Dark were allowed to live on that fantasy plain of the musicals that Selma loves so much, we could buy into it. As it is, Von Trier reduces the gorgeous music to mere melodrama. But man that music is great!",4,Brilliantly original but flawed,976492800,"12 11, 2000",2000,4991,"['Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'controversial', 'episode', 'very', 'controversial', 'career', 'case', 'do',

528300,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXKR,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","Lars von Trier is one of my favorite directors for he is unique in his visionary style, a director that takes chances and really pushes the envelope.  `Dancer in the Dark' is no exception for it is, in my humble opinion, a masterpiece of modern cinema.  Taking the beloved `musical' genre and ultimately reinventing it von Trier has served up one of the most heartbreaking and soul touching films in recent years.  Taking a musical phenomenon like Bjork and coaxing out of her a dynamic and Oscar worthy performance was astounding in itself, but Bjork is not the only wonderful thing about this movie.  It's a film about the power of love, not between a man and a woman but between a woman and her son, a love so strong that she would sacrifice her own happiness for his wellbeing.  `Dancer in the Dark' is one of those rare films that cannot be defined, cannot be pigeonholed for it is more than just a `musical', more than just a `drama', more than just a `film'.`Dancer in the Dark' introduces us to Selma Jezkova, a young Czech immigrant who works herself to the bone to support her young son Gene.  She is renting a small place from a local police officer Bill and his materialistic wife Linda.  Bill and Linda are very kind to Selma, or so it seems, and they continue to include her and her son in their lives even going as far as to buy Gene gifts that his mother cannot afford.  Selma cannot afford these things because she is saving her money for something very important.  You see Selma has a degenerative eye disease; she is going blind, and it appears that her son may go blind as well.  She needs to get together a certain sum of money in order to pay for her son's surgery, to save his sight.  She cannot tell anyone this for if Gene finds out he can actually worsen his condition through stress.Everything falls apart though when Bill comes to ask Selma for a loan.  All his money is gone because of his wife's incessant spending and he doesn't have the stomach to tell his wife the truth.  Selma explains to Bill that she cannot spend the money and she even resorts to telling him why but he takes it upon himself to steal the money from her.  In a devastating and heartbreaking sequence of events Selma finds herself standing trial for Bill's murder.  Selma's life has been one lie after another, from cheating on eye exams in order to continue working to lying about sending money to her father back home, and these lies, while harmless in themselves come back to bite her while on trial.The acting in the film truly elevates it's devastation as well for the audience really comes to know and feel for the characters within the film.  As Selma, Bjork is a revelation to say the very least.  Her performance is so subtle, so brittle, so nave and she captures the light that is inside this very peculiar young woman.  In fact, Bjork gives one of my favorite performances of the past decade.  David Morse, one of my favorite actors as of late, works wonders as Bill, layering his emotions beautifully.  Catherine Deneuve is also amazing here as Selma's friend Kathy.  Her care and concern for Selma's wellbeing is believable and commendable and in the end heartbreaking.  Peter Storemare is reserved as Jeff, a man vying for Selma's affections, and Cara Seymour is effective as Linda, the money hungry wife of Bill.  It was nice to see Joel Grey (of `Cabaret' fame) in the film, although his screen time is limited.In the end though this is a musical of sorts, and the musical numbers very well may be the most important aspects of the film.  It's within these musical numbers that Selma comes to life before our eyes.  Selma is obsessed with the cinematic spectacles known as musicals.  In fact the film opens with Selma rehearsing with a local theater group for a `Sound of Music' production.  She admits later that the reason she loves the musical so much is because ""nothing tragic ever happens in a musical"".  So, with that in mind these musical numbers provide a glimpse into the fairytale world Selma creates to help her escape her tragic life.  Usually these numbers follow something bad, or precede something worse.  As an example, after Bill's death he comes to life to sing a song of tragedy with Selma while dancing with her and parading around his house.  These numbers may upon a glance seem out of place but they add so much to Selma's character and the film in its entirety.The climax of this film will, or at least should, leave its audience in tears.  I know I for one was an emotional wreck.  As has been mentioned, this is not a film for lightweights for it is very heavy on the palette but it is a remarkable achievement to be admired and respected.  Even my wife, who is an avid Bjork hater, admits that this film touched her much deeper than she ever would have expected.",5,"Touching, moving and ultimately heartbreaking; a film to redefine film...",1192060800,"10 11, 2007",2007,4809,"['Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'one', 'favorite', 'directors', 'unique', 'visionary', 'style', 'director', 'chances', 'really', 'envelope', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'exception', 'humble', 'opinion', 'masterpiece', 'modern', 'cinema', 'Taking', 'beloved', 'musical', 'genre', 'ultimately', 'reinventing', 'von', 'Trier', 'served', 'up', 'one', 'most', 'heartbreaking', 'soul', 'touching', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'Taking', 'musical', 'phenomenon', 'Bjork', 'coaxing', 'dynamic', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performance', 'was', 'astounding', 'Bjork', 'not', 'only', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'movie', 'film', 'power', 'love', 'not', 'man', 'woman', 'woman', 'son', 'love', 'so', 'strong', 'would', 'sacrifice', 'own', 'happiness', 'wellbeing', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'defined', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'pigeonholed', 'more', 'just', 'musical', 'more', 'just', 'drama', 'more', 'just', ""film'."", 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'introduces', 'Selma', 'Jezkova', 'young', 'Czech', 'immigrant', 'who', 'bone', 'support', 'young', 'son', 'Gene', 'renting', 'small', 'place', 'local', 'police', 'officer', 'Bill', 'materialistic', 'wife', 'Linda', 'Bill', 'Linda', 'are', 'very', 'kind', 'Selma', 'so', 'continue', 'include', 'son', 'lives', 'even', 'going', 'as', 'far', 'buy', 'Gene', 'gifts', 'mother', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'Selma', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'things', 'saving', 'money', 'something', 'very', 'important', 'see', 'Selma', 'degenerative', 'eye', 'disease', 'going', 'son', 'may', 'go', 'blind', 'as', 'well', 'get', 'together', 'certain', 'sum', 'money', 'order', 'pay', 'son', 'surgery', 'save', 'sight', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'anyone', 'Gene', 'can', 'actually', 'worsen', 'condition', 'stress.Everything', 'falls', 'apart', 'when', 'Bill', 'ask', 'Selma', 'loan', 'money', 'gone', 'wife', 'incessant', 'spending', ""n't"", 'have', 'stomach', 'tell', 'wife', 'truth', 'Selma', 'Bill', 'can', 'not', 'spend', 'money', 'even', 'telling', 'why', 'steal', 'money', 'devastating', 'heartbreaking', 'sequence', 'events', 'Selma', 'standing', 'trial', 'Bill', 'murder', 'Selma', 'life', 'been', 'one', 'lie', 'cheating', 'eye', 'exams', 'order', 'continue', 'working', 'lying', 'sending', 'money', 'father', 'back', 'home', 'lies', 'harmless', 'come', 'back', 'bite', 'trial.The', 'acting', 'film', 'truly', 'devastation', 'as', 'well', 'audience', 'really', 'know', 'feel', 'characters', 'film', 'Selma', 'Bjork', 'revelation', 'say', 'very', 'least', 'performance', 'so', 'subtle', 'so', 'brittle', 'so', 'nave', 'light', 'very', 'peculiar', 'young', 'woman', 'fact', 'Bjork', 'one', 'favorite', 'performances', 'past', 'decade', 'David', 'Morse', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'late', 'wonders', 'Bill', 'layering', 'emotions', 'beautifully', 'Catherine', 'Deneuve', 'also', 'amazing', 'here', 'Selma', 'friend', 'Kathy', 'Her', 'care', 'concern', 'Selma', 'wellbeing', 'believable', 'commendable', 'end', 'heartbreaking', 'Peter', 'Storemare', 'reserved', 'Jeff', 'man', 'vying', 'Selma', 'affections', 'Cara', 'Seymour', 'effective', 'Linda', 'money', 'hungry', 'wife', 'Bill', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Joel', 'Grey', 'Cabaret', 'fame', 'film', 'screen', 'time', 'end', 'musical', 'sorts', 'musical', 'numbers', 'very', 'well', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'important', 'aspects', 'film', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Selma', 'life', 'eyes', 'Selma', 'obsessed', 'cinematic', 'spectacles', 'known', 'musicals', 'fact', 'film', 'Selma', 'rehearsing', 'local', 'theater', 'group', 'Sound', 'Music', 'production', 'later', 'reason', 'musical', 'so', 'much', 'nothing', 'tragic', 'ever', 'musical', 'So', 'mind', 'musical', 'numbers', 'provide', 'glimpse', 'fairytale', 'world', 'Selma', 'help', 'escape', 'tragic', 'life', 'Usually', 'numbers', 'follow', 'something', 'bad', 'precede', 'something', 'worse', 'example', 'Bill', 'death', 'life', 'sing', 'song', 'tragedy', 'Selma', 'dancing', 'parading', 'house', 'numbers', 'may', 'upon', 'glance', 'seem', 'place', 'add', 'so', 'much', 'Selma', 'character', 'film', 'entirety.The', 'climax', 'film', 'will', 'least', 'should', 'leave', 'audience', 'tears', 'know', 'one', 'was', 'emotional', 'wreck', 'been', 'mentioned', 'not', 'film', 'lightweights', 'very', 'heavy', 'palette', 'remarkable', 'achievement', 'be', 'admired', 'respected', 'Even', 'wife', 'who', 'avid', 'Bjork', 'hater', 'film', 'touched', 'much', 'deeper', 'ever', 'would', 'have', 'expected']",N/A

She pulls off the most jarring of song-and-dance numbers with aplomb.von Trier's casting always raises some eyebrows, though.  We're supposed to buy off on Bj&ouml;rk, Catherine Deneuve (as a character named 'Cathy,' no less) and superb European character actor Peter Stormare as the Selma-smitten 'Jeff,' all aimlessly employed at a nameless backwoods factory in rural Washington during what appears to be the 60s.

528302,A2C6LOYAPWFRP8,B00003CXKR,Ann Shillinglaw,"[2, 3]","I am most grateful to this film for having no part in the usual formula movie-making.  While its plot is somewhat standard, with a predictable outcome and conflict with a character who early on confesses he is broke (and we know she is saving a wad of cash, what could be more predictable as a conflict generator), its acting and singing and color/filming are extraordinary.  This film is as memorable as they come, connecting with the sky over our heads, the roads we walk on, the parking lots outside of our jobs that we trudge across.  The open air filming, the lack of studio pretensions are wonderful.  The high point for me was the musical interlude &quot;I've Seen It All&quot;.  It encapsulates the experience of saying goodbye to the world's gorgeous colors and sights, and to family, and to life, and Bjork's song, and the lanky actor joining her and the railroad hobos dancing, and the bright sky all converge to make a magnficent film moment that I found to be utterly breathtaking.  Her life is grim and yet, the beauty of the blue sky, the world of love and families -- the heart of the film is about loss.  I highly recommend getting this film.  However, I do find the plot devicing clunky -- I just don't believe Selma had the self-destruction in her to overlook a loving man and the villain begging to be killed is fake, something out of a Perry Mason episode, not real.  Despite its plotting flaws, Bjork is something to see.  I hope she does make more films.  She has an original presence, something very honest to contribute.  What a shame if it's all the Brad Pitts of the world on film instead of people like Bjork whose faces are special, different, interesting to watch, whose visions and voices are a touch of magic in a mundane world.  The opera of everyday life is conveyed here, and it's a great movie effort.  It didn't find a wide audience because too many people need mindless entertainment, and originality frightens people.  Even though its setting is the U.S., nothing about it felt American to me, not the factory, or the trees or the houses.  At first, the shaky camera work annoyed me a bit, but thank goodness I let go of that prejudice and let the film tell me where it was going.

In the first fifteen minutes i was transfixed, but baffled as to the purpose of this movie, but as soon as Selma (Bjork) tells us that she is going blind, and that she adores nothing more in the world than musicals, i was completely drawn in by Dancer in the Dark.I think the seemingly rough way von Trier tells this story is what makes it so fascinating. Nicole Kidman, speaking about Dogville, said that you always feel von Trier right there with you because he is always operating the camera. By so doing, he is able to hand-craft a particular character for the camera, who becomes like an extra character looking on to the events in the movie, whose eyes the audience look through. The &quot;reality&quot; world in Dancer in the Dark feels just like reality, the hardness of which Selma loves to escape from by imagining she is in a musical. To give you an idea of the kind of profundity to be found in Dancer, here is my favourite speech in the movie:Selma: &quot;Isn't that annoying when they do the last song in the films though... Because you just know when it goes really big, and the camera goes out of the roof, you just know its gonna end? I used to cheat on that when i was a little girl back in Czeckeslovakia. I would leave the cinema just after the next to last song was over - and the film would go on forever.&quot;",4,"Powerful, original, engrossing.",1079654400,"03 19, 2004",2004,1649,"[""'ve"", 'finally', 'seen', 'movie', 'rebel', 'danish', 'director', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'movies', 'famously', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'i', 'love', 'hate', 'One', 'thing', 'i', ""'m"", 'certain', 'powerful', 'engrossing', 'viewing', 'experience', 'could', ""n't"", 'turn', 'movie', 'sheer', 'curiosity', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'happen', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'i', 'was', 'transfixed', 'baffled', 'purpose', 'movie', 'as', 'soon', 'Selma', 'Bjork', 'going', 'nothing', 'more', 'world', 'musicals', 'i', 'was', 'completely', 'drawn', 'Dancer', 'Dark.I', 'think', 'seemingly', 'rough', 'way', 'Trier', 'story', 'what', 'so', 'fascinating', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'speaking', 'Dogville', 'said', 'always', 'feel', 'von', 'Trier', 'right', 'there', 'always', 'operating', 'camera', 'doing', 'able', 'hand-craft', 'particular', 'character', 'camera', 'who', 'extra', 'character', 'looking', 'events', 'movie', 'eyes', 'audience', 'look', 'quot', 'reality', 'quot', 'world', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'feels', 'just', 'reality', 'hardness', 'Selma', 'escape', 'imagining', 'musical', 'give', 'idea', 'kind', 'profundity', 'be', 'found', 'Dancer', 'here', 'favourite', 'speech', 'movie', 'Selma', 'quot', ""n't"", 'annoying', 'when', 'do', 'last', 'song', 'films', 'just', 'know', 'when', 'really', 'big', 'camera', 'roof', 'just', 'know', 'gon', 'end', 'used', 'cheat', 'when', 'i', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'back', 'Czeckeslovakia', 'would', 'leave', 'cinema', 'just', 'next', 'last', 'song', 'was', 'film', 'would', 'go', 'forever.', 'quot']",N/A

Cinema film production has a whole new set of rules.  Director Lars von Trier casts an hypnotic spell with his hand-held PC Digital epic that seduces the eye and intoxicates the ear.  Icelandic super rock star Bjork stars(in only her second film) as a Slavic emmigrant to the Northwestern U.S. in 1964, with her bespectacled son in tow. Both suffer poverty and failing eyesite. As Selma, the mother, Bjork weaves a soulful, heart-wrenching performance throughout this seminal musical-comedy tragedy. She sits in a darkened theater watching Warner Baxter and cast in 1932's classic &quot;Forty-Second Street&quot;, and dreams of dancing in a musical herself. Her multicolored singing dream sequences are perhaps the highlight of this instant classic. I had to buy the soundtrack CD immediately.  You will too. French actress Catherine Deneuve and acclaimed hoofer Joel Grey co-star. The Academy Awards voted &quot;Crouching Something&quot; best foreign film for 2000. Nobody spent millions promoting &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; in Hollywood. Not enough people took a chance on a risky new cinematic art form.  The years to come will broadcast their folly.

528306,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,B00003CXKR,Busy Body,"[9, 9]","As possibly one of the biggest Bjork fans you're ever likely to come across, it suddenly dawned on me a few months ago that I'd been a fan for about 18 months and still not seen ""Dancer In The Dark."" This year I have started to collect the entire collection of Bjork DVD's, and although it will take me a long time to purchase them all, I'm determined to achieve this. Of course, Dancer In The Dark has to be a part of this collection too, and when I saw it on sale for 5 I knew I had to have it! I bought the film without really knowing much about it, and watched it one Saturday evening when I was tucked up in bed with the mumps!This film totally absorbed me and drew me into its world of raw and pure human emotion in its simplest format. It took quite a while to really reel me in, but I'd say after the first 45 minutes, something clicked and I was sold. The film is directed by Lars Von Trier and received a standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival in 2000. During the filming, Bjork walked off the set for three days because she was so upset with Lars Von Trier. She was so angry she bit off a piece of his shirt before walking off! This movie is also classed as a musical because of the music sequences in it, but it's probably the most unconventional musical ever made. This is totally an anti-Hollywood movie, which is probably the reason why it was so overlooked.Bjork stars as Selma Jeskova, a simpleminded Czech immigrant, who moves to America with her young son Gene. She has an immense love for musicals and is rehearsing her role as Maria in ""The Sound Of Music"" when the film opens. She works many hours a day in a factory and lives in a small house next to one of the town's local policemen. She pays rent to the policeman and his wife, and forms a strong friendship with them. Selma harbours a dark secret, however: she is going blind, and unless she can save enough money to pay for an operation, Gene will inherit her blindness. This is the reason she works so many hours in the factory, to save up enough money to pay for the operation. Any money she earns that isn't spent on rent or food goes into her little box of cash to pay for the operation. Her work mate Kathy (Catherine Deneuve) becomes a close friend to Selma, and takes her to the cinema to see her favourite musicals. As Selma's eyesight deteriorates, she confides in her police man neighbor Bill Houston (David Morse). He also reveals to her that he is having big money troubles since his wife Linda (Cara Seymour) has frittered all their money away on expensive things.Later on, he asks Selma if he can borrow her money to pay off his debts, and that she will get it back at the end of the month. The money means everything to her, and she politely rejects his request. This is where the film starts to descend into madness, and Selma's life begins to spiral out of control. What makes this film so heartbreaking to watch is the fact that Selma is a genuinely nice person. She is a pure spirit and means no harm to anyone, and the fact that she does commit a horrific crime - no matter how cruel circumstances - is so tragic and disappointing. Bill is revealed to be a truly evil character over the course of the first hour, and his wife nothing more than a sheep who will believe anything she is told. Selma is prayed on because of her weaknesses, such as her compassion for others, and her deteriorating eyesight. Throughout the entire movie she maintains her innocence at all times, and accepts things as they are. In many ways, she's too kind for her own good.We may occasionally forget that this is in fact, by definition, a musical. The central storyline is so strong that you forget all about the music at times. When Selma is feeling low, confused, scared or depressed, she daydreams and her fantasies become reality on the screen. The majority of the film is filmed by Von Trier with cameras that capture the human qualities of the characters, frequently zooming in on intimate situations, which creates the effect that we are peeping through a hole at the action going on. The colour is also rather dull, but the reason for this is so that once the musical segments kick in, we can see the remarkable difference between how Selma perceives her real life to her musical life. Songs performed include ""Cvalda,"" ""I've Seen It All,"" ""Scatterheart"" and ""107 Steps."" All the original songs in the movie were written and produced by Bjork, and can be found on the soundtrack to the film ""Selmasongs.""OVERALL GRADE: 10/10I was very pleased with this movie after watching it, but it really does shake you to the core. In the final ten minutes, I could feel my heart beating through my chest and my eyes moisten. This doesn't ease even on repeat viewings, even when you know exactly the grim outcome. If anything, you feel it more because you know what's coming in those final minutes. This is the kind of film that captures its audiences in those certain moments, and would hold an entire audience of hundreds silent and stunned. This is the most open and honest portrayal of raw human emotion I think I have ever witnessed in a film. ""Schindler's List"" only tops it I think, and that is only because the focus is on millions, and not just a single victim like in this film. Overall I would recommend this film to people who want a cinematic challenge, and not just your typical Hollywood film where everything turns out fine in the end.",5,A Stunning And Unforgettable Movie

528311,A2NX99GVAX4TRP,B00003CXKR,"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[3, 8]","For much of Lars Von Triers newest non Dogme 95 film, I was having a flashback to nearly every bleak and depressing Danish and Swedish film I've ever seen.  This is bleak, this is depressing, and I know it's going to get worse before (or should say if,) it gets any better.It's in English, and Bjork's elfin face is a fascinating one to watch, even without make-up (which is usually how we see it) and in too close close-up in Dreyer (Passion of Joan of Arc) fashion.For the first 40 minutes of the film we are treated to some of the most seemingly natural unassuming acting your likely to see this year.There's a very good reason why Bjork won the top acting prize at Cannes this year.  You've probably heard how she nearly had a breakdown on the film's set and talked about never acting again. She's since softened her one time bitter feelings toward Von Trier.  The entire cast however are quite good.  Even cult star Udo Kier in his cameo is unassuming in his portrayal of a doctor.Peter Stormare (who does a nice job in Chocolat) impresses in the rather thankless role of Jeff, a not too bright factory worker who has a crush on Selma.  The film gets a huge boost from the acting of the ecclectically cast melting pot of thespians.  Americans, Danes, French, Russians, all populate the small Pacific Northwest town where most of the film takes place.It's 1963. The former Sugar Cube leader singer, Icelandic Bjork is cast as Selma a Czech immigrant, single mom.  She is working in a factory that makes stainless steel sinks.  Selma is friends with , and works next to Kathy (who is played surprisingly by Catherine Deneuve -in a wonderful emotional performance ) and lives in a small trailer on the property of Bill (another wonderful performance from David Morse) and his wife Linda (Cara Seymour) who's spending more than Bill makes.  Selma's passion is Hollywood musicals and she's rehearsing for a local theatre production of The Sound of Music (she's playing Maria Von Trapp).  However, Selma is going blind, fast.  She'll probably be completely blind in less than a year and it's begun to affect her.  She also knows her son has the same genetic condition that is taking her sight.  It's too late to save her own sight, but Selma is working a couple of different jobs to save enough money to afford an operation for her son.  A son she doesn't even spend money on to buy Christmas or Birthday present (because every dime must be saved for his operation).How does Selma keep her sanity?  She fantasizes about lavish musical numbers.Now this type of thing has been before.  A character escapes their bleak life through fantasy in films such as Sherlock Junior, The Projectionist,  Purple Rose of Cairo, Cinema Paradiso and of course in Dennis Potter's The Singing Detective and Pennies from Heaven, (which was made into an above average film starring Steve Martin).That's what we have here essentially.  Only the musical production numbers we eventually start to see aren't much better than the ones Woody Allen gave us in Everyone Says I Love You or the best forgotten Bogdanovich turkey At Long Last Love.  Well at least in this film most of the people who sing, actually can.We've seen music videos which have reached all the way back to Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times for inspiration in turning the methodical clunks and hisses of factory machinery into inspirations for musical dance (or comedy) numbers.  And there is one of those here.  It is enjoyable but it works mainly because of  Bjork.  Her elfin face and unassuming natural way about her is suddenly hosting this powerful, voice.  The effect is mesmerizing.  It almost makes you forget to be overly critical of how shoddily the dance numbers are choreographed.100 video cameras captured the musical number in the factory.  I'm sure the best shots were used. Vince Paterson was the choreographer and he's had experience on Madonna and Michael Jackson videos, and cinematographer Robby Muller is bursting with talent.  The result is not impressive. We don't get Busby Berkley, Michael Kidd, West Side Story, or even Rocky Horror Picture Show.  We get a second rate low budget road company attempting to create a best left on the cutting room floor musical number from the film OLIVER. Nothing here comes close to that wonderfully conceived Grand Central Station musical number in  Terry Gilliam's The Fisher King.  That's the scene where the rush hour in Grand Central Station suddenly transforms into a beautiful stylized waltz.At one point we even get Joel Grey in one of these fantasies, but we are robbed of a satisfying musical sequence with how Von Trier chooses to frame the shots.He's making points. He's stirring up the emotions in so many ways and setting us up for the knock out punch.I won't spoil it but let's just say, the entire film builds towards what occurs in the film's last 15 minutes.  Not just what occurs, but how it is done.The film's final fifteen minute scene is among the most emotional and powerful scenes you'll ever see.  Selma's real and fantasy life blend and we are left with the promise of one more song.I think this is one of the greatest films of the last decade, yet there is a lot of things in the film I disliked a great deal.  I think Von Trier makes some truly awful choices in some scenes.But I've got to take the movie in as a whole piece and it would be a lie to not say the film left me an emotional wreck.  This is, of course exactly what the movie was trying to do.Here we have a film that is not easy to watch, that is full of flaws and disappointments , yet contains some brilliant acting, and delivers a powerful and poignant knock out punch.Christopher J Jarmick, Author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

It can tear a viewer's emotions apart, and perhaps justly so. But good as it is, ""Dancer in the Dark"" is also a deeply flawed film. First, the musical numbers; they seemed to me purposeless and obtrusive; telling the story straight would have given it more power and polish. Secondly, a classic tragedy also is capable of offering a catharsis, usually obtained by delicatedly handled irony (the villain--David Morse character--could have been divulged to a third party, for instance). Thirdly, filmed in Sweden and supposedly representing rural America, this movie is openly and vitriolically anti-American. Selma's trial is the stupidest trial ever put on film, bigotry admitted, and the system of justice represented here is nothing but a sadistic machine torturing a guitless and noble victim. Yes, injustices like that do exist and should be put on film. Raskolnikov has a dream of a horse being stoned to death. Kafka has Gregor Samsa die in utter loneliness as cockroach. And Fellini gives us Gelsomina dying of unrelieved grief after a brute has killed a friend. Perhaps, Lars von Trier should have tried to imitate those masters.

Bjork, in her first and sadly I hear last theatrical performance, delivers a brutally moving and heart wrenching performance as Selma Jezkova, a young single mother from Czechoslovakia who has moved to the states to give her son Gene (Vladica Kostic) a better life.  That better life includes a surgery on his eyes that will prevent him from going blind.  Selma herself is rapidly losing her sight and fears that by the end of the year she herself will be blind.Selma works herself to the bone, putting away every ounce of cash she can muster in order to give her son the life she is losing.  Selma rents a small trailer from a local police officer Bill Houston (David Morse) and his wife Linda (Cara Seymour) who seem to be living well off money Bill inherited from his late father, but one late night both Bill and Selma divulge their darkest secrets to each other, Bill the fact that he's run out of money and Selma the fact that she's saving up for Gene's surgery, a surgery that she's almost got up enough money for.With those few words Selma sealed her fate, unbeknownst to her, and set the wheels in motion for her to see everyone's true colors.  This film, a brutally moral driven drama masked as a musical, strikes every chord wonderfully thanks to brilliant acting and directing and a wonderful thought provoking and completely engaging and original script.  Bjork is Oscar worthy, her raw emotions spilling onto the screen so effortlessly.  David Morse is another standout here.  He's become the standard villain, able to raise the hairs on my neck with just a glance in my direction.  One of the greatest films I've seen in recent years, that's for sure, and it's an experience that everyone should enjoy.

First let me start by saying two things to prove that this won't be a biased review; 1.I hate most musicals(I can stand a few like &quot;Cabaret&quot;) 2.I like Bjork but I'm not a big fan. I don't want to touch too much on the plot because I had no clue what the film was about when I went to see it and I'm glad I did. The themes in the film are many, touching on everything from single mothering and the death penalty. The style of the film overall reminds me of Bertolt Brecht's plays. Most of the characters are very alienated and the singing and dancing are always upbeat on a dismal subject and aren't sung to sound pretty and clear. The last number in the film with in context of what was going on is the most Brechtian scene I've seen outside Brecht and Churchill's Mad Forest play. The story is very tragic but I wasn't crying at the end. It's the same technique Brecht was trying to use in his plays. The film doesn't indulge in being too avant garde and arty, it keeps a perfect balance of creativity and straight forwardness.

528319,A2U22M4AXDZDYU,B00003CXKR,Dan Balogh,"[1, 1]","Danish director Lars Von Trier, who gave us BREAKING THE WAVES, one of the most thought-provoking and controversial films of the 90s, tops himself with this stunningly original film, already one of the most discussed films of the new decade and winner of this year's Palme d'Or at Cannes.Icelandic rock performer Bjork (winner of the Best Female Performance award at Cannes) is Selma, a Czech mother working in Washington State in the 1960s, scraping together the funds necessary for an operation to stem the impending blindness of her son Gene, a degenerative disease to which she herself has already fallen victim. As her blindness progresses, Selma finds escape in the happy worlds of her deluded daydreams which are influenced by the highly-stylized Busby Berkeley musicals on which she was weaned.Unlike those films, however, this film is not a musical but rather a very grim, emotionally enervating film peppered with the several incongruous musical numbers which are Selma's reveries. The musical numbers work beautifully, however, as welcome relief to not just Selma but also to the viewer who is dragged by Von Trier through every brutal scene in Selma's increasingly pathetic life. (If you saw BREAKING THE WAVES, you'll know exactly what to expect.)The film is certainly not without its faults. Von Trier's insistence on shooting in digital video (and then transferring to film) results in a much less resolved and very unfilm-like image, especially when magnified on a huge cinema screen (this is not a problem at all on the DVD). Furthermore, his insistence on obeying the Dogma tenet of realism by overuse of shaky hand-held cameras is annoying at first, though the realism it introduces is appreciated by the end, especially when contrasted with Selma's musical fantasies which are shot almost completely with stationary cameras, and with much more color. Finally, the viewer is required to suspend disbelief through some huge plot holes along the way, especially near the end.Despite these flaws the film is an emotional powerhouse which will leave patient viewers rewarded, albeit emotionally drained.

528321,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B00003CXKR,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[5, 5]","WOW!  Talk about a tour de force.  My viewing memory of ""Dancer in the Dark"" happened half-a-year ago, a month after I saw my first Lars von Trier film, ""Antichrist"".  That film was wonderfully designed but the story was sparse and disturbingly exotic, so it didn't leave me a positive impression of what von Trier is as a director.  With Dancer, he showed me what he's capable of, making a cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute; film that's endearing at heart but uncompromising at social brutality.  Few movies have moved me in such a powerful way like this one, and it's a memory that can never go away.Of course, the majority of the film's strength can also be thanked by Bj&ouml;rk.  What can I possible say about her performance? She's the most abstract artist on the music scene, and there are other more comprehensive singers that acted in films before her, but she surprised me by how poignant she was. The character she plays is a frail, misunderstood foreigner who can barely speak English, which is a perfect casting choice for Bj&ouml;rk because she too is a frail, misunderstood foreigner who can barely speak English. But that's not enough to just a play the part because both share similar quirks; one has to BE the part, and Bj&ouml;rk manages to step up her game. So much so that this is the only movie she has acted, apparently because the film really strained her.Her character named Selma is just unfortunate. Selma was a Czech factory worker who is actually myopic, but she kept that secret from everyone, except for her friend Cathy (Catherine Deneuve); she had dreams of being in a musical and enjoys dancing with company despite her condition. She also happened to have a son, and because her vision condition is hereditary, her son too will be as blind as her. Therefore, she's saving up money and lied to people about her savings so she can use the money for her son's eye operation. Sadly, her kindness and naivete has lead her to real trouble, mainly by the cause of a police officer played by David Morse (that guy that either plays a bad guy or a jerk in all his films), but mostly by her stupid choices.Normally, I chastise characters who make stupid decisions like those in the film ""Babel"", but I couldn't hate Selma. One look at her face, and there's no way I can not sympathize with her; she appeared so innocent, she didn't really mean to make mistakes. The best way to compare her is a puppy: puppies tend to cause a ruckus, but you can't scorn them because they look so adoring, and seeing them abused is painful. When Selma experiences some traumatic events, they're unimaginably woeful. Bj&ouml;rk's best acting prowess came in that one scene near the third act where she threw out that fragile state and being fiercely stubborn when Cathy did something that almost compromised her son's operation; THAT'S the sight of a concerned mother. She gave it her all as well in the final scene, which was simply cruel and heart-breaking.Since Selma likes musicals, she daydreams about musicals which is rather sardonic. The way the film transitions to a musical number was brilliant and creatively designed: these numbers are vivid, well-shot and lively in contrast to the low-color, unfocused and dim real world that she's in; the musicals happen in her imagination and they halt whenever a real situation occurred, so the transitions were believable.  Her songs kinda bothered me at first, but listening to the soundtrack overtime, I end up finding them all mesmerizing, with the exception of 'Scatterheart' which has Bj&ouml;rk's constant habit of singing out of tune to the music.  It's amazing how a movie so grim can turn the other cheek with a tune, and it does it so masterfully.I can't recommend ""Dancer in the Dark"" highly enough. In retrospect, the story was far-fetched at times, but nonetheless the main actress has made the film profound and captivating.

No doubt, there plenty of people with some serious mental disoders, but this woman has some of the worst I've seen.  Imagine brutally killing a man with an gun and suitcase.

She is basically a daydreamer who lives in her musicial words not caring for the outside world.The story is set in the 1960s.  There is a reason for this, but it hangs on by a thread.  She works in a factory where she gets bored quickly.  She imagines she is in a musicial where everyone in the factory is singing along.  That had to be one of the strangest sequences I've ever seen in any film.  Strange because it showed just how WITHDRAWN this chick is.  The other problem of the 'Dancer in the Dark' is the director.

Unlike traditional musicals with glitz, costumes, bearded Jewish men overcoming strife and poverty to bring their families love and happiness, and little children with British nannies learning how to value people over price tags, Lars von Trier shows us how a very unassuming immigrant, Selma (Bjork) is in some ways saved by the pictures pirouetted into her heart, beat after precious beat. I'm still deciding if she can act, or if it was the direction that gave her such a powerful performance. Regardless, Dancer in the Dark is a presentation of a woman about as far away from Julie Andrews' vast repertoire as one can get.The story seems a retelling of The Gift of the Magi, only with vignettes of musical numbers, representing escape for Selma as she works her fingers to the bone, scrimping and saving her American dollars for one lofty and personal purpose. Devoid of vision, Selma is an astute listener, seeing Babes in Arms in a factory floor late at night.But why do they burst into song all the time?Musicals, despite the bad rap they receive, were the first live theatrical animals. In fact, non-musical play actors were shunned. In life, emotion is often too great to exist and be shared with simple words. Using one's voice in song, or body in dance expresses a myriad of feelings, thoughts, and cadences unique to the genre.The use of these flights of fancy in Dancer in the Dark are from Selma's perspective. The sounds of life as her orchestra allow her to create a safe and &quot;dread-less&quot; reality, as her own world is crashing around her.No longer able to work, and robbed of her only dream: to save her son the same sightless plight, she makes the ultimate sacrifice.Raw, throbbing, primal, and deep are the woes and decisions Bjork hands us here. WIth a supporting cast that never misses a beat, cruelly so at times, we are in agony as the final scene fades to the musical credits.At times overlong in tangent, some songs do not further the story as they should, becoming repetitive and distracting, the overall look of the piece is perfect. The use of hand-held camera, close-ups on eyes and objects, all bring us into a mind that never sees her surroundings as one cohesive pattern.It's not a happy film.

With &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;, he continues the same theme of his beautifully bleak previous film &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot;: He constructs a lead character that is loving, innocent, pure and humble, and then proceeds to have that character systematically degraded, humiliated, abused and finally killed. For what purpose? Most likely to show that modern society is no place for innocents. It's a dog eat dog world, and Von Trier doesn't want us to forget it.Painful as it is to watch, this is a great film.

528329,A35J4XGRWXVZ00,B00003CXKR,Edward,"[1, 2]","I have to admit that after a first puzzled reaction I was intrigued if not particularly excited by the unusual -- well, actually, bizarre -- film experience that is &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;. I was not famaliar with the director Lars von Trier nor with his star Bj&ouml;rk. As for von Trier, evidently he has delivered to the motion picture establishment , with his Dogma 95, a manifesto of the New Cinema, a rejection of the slick conventions offered at the Cineplex. With a hand-held camera and cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute; handling of locations and actors, he's doing basically what the Nouvelle Vague was doing forty years ago. There are limitations. The camera work becomes too self-consciously unsteady,and von Trier does not have a light touch with actors. Bj&ouml;rk, for instance. Bj&ouml;rk, it turns out, is a plain, somewhat mannered woman who has a fanatical following due to her soulful new-age singing, complete with deliberate cracks and wobbles. In this film, her second, she is playing Selma, a Czechoslovakian immigrant who is going blind and who, after being betrayed and vicitimized, is put on trial for murder. The story is set in Washington State in the early 1960's, though it doesn't seem particularly American. (Another reviewer has wondered how, in the boondocks, a revival movie house can stay open on three customers per night.) Selma is suppose to be rehearsing an amateur production of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, in which she has the role of Maria. These rehearsals, clueless and almost competely devoid of children, seem arbitrary and interminable. Musicals are Selma's passion, and whenever life becomes too tense, she reverts to a dream world where her surroundings are transformed into simplistic song-and-dance routines that look like MTV. (Bj&ouml;rk is credited with writing the songs.) Selma says she loves musicals because nothing dreadful ever happens in them, which tells me she doesn't know her Rodgers and Hammerstein: young men get killed in &quot;Carousel&quot;, &quot;South Pacific&quot;, and &quot;The King and I&quot;. At any rate, Bj&ouml;rk has a peculiar talent suitable for supporting this type of entertainment, and she gets help from David Morse as a neurotic cop and Peter Storemare (usually a villain) as Selma's sweet-natured dopey suitor. Catherine Deneuve (who seems to have a thing for off-beat screenplays) plays a protective friend of Selma's; and Joel Grey is agile and dapper in a small but important role -- nearly 50 years after he made his film debut in &quot;About Face&quot;, an awful Warners musical. &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; is long, nearly two and a half hours, which is quite a stretch for misty-eyed surrealism, but I was drawn enough by von Trier's style to try one of his other films in the future.",3,"Not one of my favorite things, but ...",989971200,"05 16, 2001",2001,2797,"['have', 'admit', 'first', 'puzzled', 'reaction', 'was', 'intrigued', 'not', 'particularly', 'excited', 'unusual', 'well', 'actually', 'bizarre', 'film', 'experience', 'quot', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'quot', 'was', 'not', 'famaliar', 'director', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'star', 'Bj', 'ouml', 'rk', 'von', 'Trier', 'evidently', 'delivered', 'motion', 'picture', 'establishment', 'Dogma', '95', 'manifesto', 'New', 'Cinema', 'rejection', 'slick', 'conventions', 'offered', 'Cineplex', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'cin', 'eacute', 'v', 'eacute', 'rit', 'eacute', 'handling', 'locations', 'actors', 'doing', 'basically', 'what', 'Nouvelle', 'Vague', 'was', 'doing', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'are', 'limitations', 'camera', 'work', 'becomes', 'too', 'self-consciously', 'unsteady', 'von', 'Trier', 'not', 'have', 'light', 'touch', 'actors', 'Bj', 'ouml', 'rk', 'instance', 'Bj', 'ouml', 'rk', 'out', 'plain', 'somewhat', 'mannered', 'woman', 'who', 'fanatical', 'following', 'due', 'soulful', 'new-age', 'singing', 'complete', 'deliberate', 'cracks', 'wobbles', 'film', 'second', 'playing', 'Selma', 'Czechoslovakian', 'immigrant', 'who', 'going', 'blind', 'who', 'being', 'betrayed', 'vicitimized', 'put', 'trial', 'murder', 'story', 'set', 'Washington', 'State', 'early', '1960', ""n't"", 'seem', 'particularly', 'American', 'reviewer', 'wondered', 'how', 'boondocks', 'revival', 'movie', 'house', 'can', 'stay', 'open', 'three', 'customers', 'night', 'Selma', 'suppose', 'be', 'rehearsing', 'amateur', 'production', 'quot', 'Sound', 'Music', 'quot', 'role', 'Maria', 'rehearsals', 'clueless', 'almost', 'competely', 'devoid', 'children', 'seem', 'arbitrary', 'interminable', 'Musicals', 'are', 'Selma', 'passion', 'whenever', 'life', 'too', 'tense', 'dream', 'world', 'where', 'surroundings', 'are', 'transformed', 'simplistic', 'song-and-dance', 'routines', 'look', 'MTV', 'Bj', 'ouml', 'rk', 'credited', 'writing', 'songs', 'Selma', 'musicals', 'nothing', 'dreadful', 'ever', ""n't"", 'know', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'young', 'men', 'get', 'killed', 'quot', 'Carousel', 'quot', 'quot', 'South', 'Pacific', 'quot', 'quot', 'King', 'quot', 'rate', 'Bj', 'ouml', 'rk', 'peculiar', 'talent', 'suitable', 'supporting', 'type', 'entertainment', 'help', 'David', 'Morse', 'neurotic', 'cop', 'Peter', 'Storemare', 'usually', 'villain', 'Selma', 'sweet-natured', 'dopey', 'suitor', 'Catherine', 'Deneuve', 'who', 'have', 'thing', 'off-beat', 'screenplays', 'protective', 'friend', 'Selma', 'Joel', 'Grey', 'agile', 'dapper', 'small', 'important', 'role', 'nearly', '50', 'years', 'made', 'film', 'debut', 'quot', 'About', 'Face', 'quot', 'awful', 'Warners', 'musical', 'quot', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'quot', 'long', 'nearly', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'quite', 'stretch', 'misty-eyed', 'surrealism', 'was', 'drawn', 'enough', 'von', 'Trier', 'style', 'try', 'one', 'other', 'films', 'future']",N/A

Anyone who could complain about such things as a wobbly camera and bleached-out color are clearly missing the point, and focusing far to closely on a small detail of a masterpiece.  The movie focuses on the harshness of extreme realism.  Life is not brushed up with cinematographic sequences, it does not have a clever score, and it certainly does not have a steady camera and viewpoint to record it all.  But life is beautiful all the same.Life is beautiful because without it there is no art, no musicals.  The musical sequences are the romantic idealistic break from and fuel for life itself.  Only by contrasting the steady, bright, livid musical scenes with the documentary-like remainder of the movie is the full extent of both realized.  Its hard to explain how it works but it just does.  The movie is not badly edited, as can be seen from the musical scenes that any such &quot;bad cuts&quot; were intentional.The characterization of Selma and her downfall were perfectly done.  Selma is not a genius, she gives the few gifts she has willingly to all who ask for them, but she continues to work hard and never complains.  She is child-like in some ways, but very experienced in others.  Before her part, I never really believed that an actor could contribute to a film, that someone else could do just as good a job, but Bjork is amazing.  Her music is not as catchy as some, but it is hypnotizing.  Bjork is smiling happily one minute, crying the next, but through most of the movie cheerful and giving through the worst events possible.  Bjork IS Selma.  All the supporting characters are good too.In conclusion this is a really good movie.  If you don't like sad things, you won't like this, but if you can handle it you really should see this movie.  It should have been much better recognized at the Oscars, and it really sucks that it only got like one nomination.

Breaking the Waves was one of the best movies of the 90's and I think one of the most heartbreaking and disturbing movies I have ever seen.  With that in mind, I went to see Dancer in the Dark.  Again, the dogma influence is there, it isn't in full-effect, but the psuedo-documentary stylings are all apparent.  Shaky camera, natural light, stark surroundings, it's all there.  This movie is a mixed bag, it's very pretentious and discards all of reality in the process.  Obviously, Lars went out of his way to make the anti-musical, but I like musicals and I don't appreciate them getting trampled as some illegitimate form of entertainment.  As most have said Bjork gives a great performance, reading interviews and things it seems she went the method acting route and just dove straight into the character.  It shows, the performance is relentless.  Not to be overlooked are Peter Stormare of Fargo fame, and David Morse, who both give excellent performances in supporting roles.  The main problems I have with this movie is the false emotion, the circumstances of some of the events, and the slap-in-the-face ending.  Von Trier is known for putting his female characters through the ringer, and just laying layer upon layer of hell on them.  This is no exception, Selma as she is called, is basically destroyed in this movie.  It seems Lars loves watching women suffer, or maybe it is what he is good at capturing, who knows.  Lastly, I have watched the movie 2 times, and I just burst out laughing when the safety-deposit box beating occurs, I find it comical for some reason.  Call me sick, but that's me.  The soundtrack is excellent, but I have written about that too much.  The movie is fairly entertaining, but all in all it just seems like manipulation.

528332,A16HJ1HKZAF9BF,B00003CXKR,Fiona,"[9, 21]","This movie is quite overrated. The music is repetitive and doesn't have the energy needed to really excite me emotionally. The most annoying thing about the work is the jerky camera movements that try to make this look like a 'documentary', a 'filmed on the spot' sort of thing. This doesn't allow one to be really engrossed in the movie, and it probably doesn't belong in a work that tries to show its main character's imagination and flights of fancy. But most importantly, the movie is really, really, really full of plot holes. Firstly, why did Kathy not testify for her friend, since she helped her cheat on the eye doctor's exam? She knew Kathy was really blind, so why did she just sit in the audience and cry? Secondly, how could Kathy have gotten the money to pay the lawyer since it had already been given to the doctor for Gene's operation? Surely he wouldn't have given it back to any stranger coming by asking about his patients. Thirdly, from a stranger's point of view, if Selma really cold-heartedly planned the murder of her landlord, why would she allow his wife, who witnessed part of the event, escape?There are films where the plot matters little, and serves a purpose only as to explore the characters or a particular situation. However, I did not get the feeling after watching this movie that we are to leave the plot alone, and concentrate on other subtle messages from the film. The supposed 'power' in this movie depends very much on plot--and its inconsistencies only make the story, and its overall message, very hard to believe.Besides these problems, the director tries to evoke emotion through cheap, tear-jerker methods. From Jeff's ""I love you"", to the guard's ""I know you love your son very much"" to the executioner's penchant for sticking to regulations, von Trier relies too much on cardboard villains and the beautiful-and-unblemished-but-lost-heroine type.

Bjork does a tremendous job in what was surely an emotionally draining part, but everyone in the cast really does an outstanding job.I recognize the superb qualities of this film, but honestly it's not one I care for.  Too tragic, and the second half of the film really was milked and dragged out to get the most boo-hoos.

528334,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B00003CXKR,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[2, 5]","Director Lars Van Trier certainly knows how to infuriate, as well as entertain, viewers. The first 30+ minutes of this film are bordering on unwatchable. The jerky hand-held camera work comes off as sophmoric, ill-at-ease, poorly executed; terrible lighting, terrible angles...like it was not story boarded at all; like it was shot by a 15 year old film student with an 8 mm camera. A third of the audience gets motion sickness. I guess one can forgive Trier for substituting southern Sweden for Washington state, but why would any artist, director, or cinematographer consciously choose to present the audience with a plethora of poorly composed shots ?  But specific kudos to whomever conceived of the musical numbers. The music seemed to spring out of the guts of factory machines, and the state of naivte and confusion in the mind of Selma/Bjork. Each of the musical numbers worked like gangbusters; very creative. Ironically, during the musical interludes, the camera work smoothed out, and one remembered that Trier was also the director of BREAKING THE WAVES, and THE KINGDOM. But in between the musical moments, one was resubmerged into the poorly written dialogue, and the jumpy hand-held hell of the first part of the film. Yes, we know that Art is supposed to outrage and challenge us, and if that is the case then maybe this film deserved it's Palm D'or from Cannes in 2000. But it does not change the fact that one has to have the constitution of a Russian weight lifter to ride out the celluloid chaff, in order to hang on with our teeth and arrive at the emotional heart of the film.

528340,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B00003CXKR,Gregor von Kallahann,"[4, 4]","You could call DANCER IN THE DARK an ""anti-musical,"" but that might suggest that musicals up until this point have been a kind of static genre that needed this kind of corrective.Actually, since at least CABARET and likely before, musicals have been less about ""Let's-put-on-a-show"" than ""Let's-explore-the-dark-side-of-our-souls.""  There hasn't been anything in the way of cinematic Sondheim so far, but from NEW YORK NEW YORK to HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH, film musicals have been getting less and less sunny and more and more ominous in recent decades.  In light of that history, how radical a departure is DANCER IN THE DARK really?  The sordid ""reality"" vs. the musical ""fantasy"" is not all that new.  The television version of PENNIES FROM HEAVEN did it at least as well.The film's almost naturalistic reality sequences become almost as surreal as the musical fantasy sequences by the last third of the film.  While there is some internal logic to Selma's refusal to participate actively in her own defense, there is clearly no reason why others (her friends Kathy and Jeff, in particular) would have not been able to come to her aid more effectively. The trial and subsequent prison stay and execution are meant to be stark and disturbing.  To some extent these scenes succeed in that, but there is much about the last hour or so that just does not ring true--even in the stylized and distorted sense of ""truth"" that von Trier is trading on here.The reviewers who complained about von Trier's ""anti-Americanism"" make a point.  European audiences, for instance, may eat this stuff up (it did win the Palme d'Or after all), but American viewers might find it way an un(der)-nuanced representation of American culture and our legal system, even if it's the culture and  legal system of 40 years ago.On the other hand, as anti-death penalty films go, it is at least as good as DEAD MAN WALKING and much subtler and more effective than LAST DANCE.  Like those films (and so many other Death Row dramas), however, DANCER does give its talented cast a chance to shine.  Bjork's cinematic debut is impressive (and it's a real shame that the experience proved so traumatic that she has foresworn acting from now on).  Catherine Deneuve is quietly effective (although still a touch too glamorous for her role as an immigrant factory worker).  And it's always nice to see David Morse in a substantial role. Von Trier is a good director of actors.

I actually saw this on election night in 2000.  I had to get the hell out of the house because I would have watched election returns all night.  The thing was during the film, I didn't think once about the election, the film is so intense and mesmerizing.  Lars von Trier is one of the greatest filmmakers working today, and this was another example of his immense talent.  I've seen almost everything the man has done (except The Kingdom II and an uncensored version of The Idiots), and all of it is worth watching several times.  The juxaposition of musical numbers in a relentingly sad and depressing story works amazingly well here.  Bjork's music is beautiful (von Trier wrote the lyrics for the songs), and as Damon Wise said above, this is not a smug, ""ironic"" film.  This is a passionate, sincere film that really rocks you emotionally.  There is no detachment here; you are involved whether you like it or not.  I don't care how ""hip"" you are, this will get to you.  It's a masterpiece.The performances here are top notch, but Bjork's performance is out of this universe.  This was really her first true film role (she had a small role in The Juniper Tree years before this), and she's a natural actress.  However, working with von Trier proved too taxing, and she's never taken a lead role again (at least not yet).  But in this one role, Bjork's acting legacy outshines many other actresses who have worked for years.  She's so good here that she blow many Hollywood actresses with a longer list of credits completely out of the water.  Bjork's musical legacy is already set, and her acting legacy is set too just on the basis of this one performance, which is truly remarkable.

528346,A11GVIS6AXDEAX,B00003CXKR,James Chong,"[4, 5]","Like all works of art that have dared to push the boundaries of their respective mediums, Dancer in the Dark is a film that is just as widely hated as it is loved. Some critics have lauded the film as a work of brilliant originality, while others have denounced it as pretentious and self-indulgent. Admittedly, this controversy was one of the reasons I was eager to see the film for myself. Well, by the end of this two-and-a-half hour musical-drama, the handful of men and women sitting with me in the small art house theater were either too stunned to speak or so overwhelmed with emotion that they were reduced to fitful sobs. When the credits hit, there was a guarded applause.Sure, von Trier's post-Dogma 95 film still adheres to many of the tenets of that minimalist movement of which he was a cofounder, and in doing so, there are moments in the film that reek of artistic self-importance. But even the most hardened cynic cannot walk out of this film without being affected by the shattering power of Bjork's performance or the ingenious directorial artistry that von Trier evinces in telling her story and, more impressively, in making us care about it. As Selma -- the Czech immigrant factory worker who is slowly losing her eyesight -- Bjork is able to surpass the melodramatic tendencies of the script and piece together a human portrait so honest and poignant that it is nearly impossible to walk out of this film without being haunted by it.Sure, the film deals with tough subject matter and is often quite sad, but I wouldn't call it depressing. For me, the term &quot;depressing&quot; applies to a situation that is devoid of hope or is burdened by the overwhelming weight of hopelessness. Though Dancer in the Dark is about a woman laden with miserable circumstances, which increasingly worsen as the film progresses, von Trier always makes it clear that Selma is actively in control of her destiny. She consciously makes the decisions that lead to the state that we leave her in at the end of the film, and knowing this makes her fate somewhat more bearable.It seems that as the art house/indie film world is gradually blending into the mainstream, and filmgoers are becoming more and more savvy and are expecting more from cinema than just entertainment, people are also becoming overly critical of films to the point that the emotional magic of the movies is slowly being phased out. Dancer in the Dark is a film that is unabashedly outright in its artistic extremes and disarmingly honest in its emotional manipulation, but in the capable hands of gifted, compassionate artists like Lars von Trier and Bjork (who composed and performed the astonishing soundtrack), it is a film that obliterates the restrictive floodgates of contemporary cynicism and allows one to both weep and revel at the delicacy and the intricacies of the human condition.",5,"A challenging film, but in the best possible ways",971827200,"10 18, 2000",2000,2866,"['works', 'art', 'have', 'dared', 'push', 'boundaries', 'respective', 'mediums', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'film', 'just', 'widely', 'hated', 'loved', 'critics', 'have', 'lauded', 'film', 'work', 'brilliant', 'originality', 'others', 'have', 'denounced', 'pretentious', 'self-indulgent', 'Admittedly', 'controversy', 'was', 'one', 'reasons', 'was', 'eager', 'see', 'film', 'myself', 'Well', 'end', 'two-and-a-half', 'hour', 'musical-drama', 'handful', 'men', 'women', 'sitting', 'small', 'art', 'house', 'theater', 'were', 'either', 'too', 'stunned', 'speak', 'so', 'overwhelmed', 'emotion', 'were', 'reduced', 'fitful', 'sobs', 'When', 'credits', 'hit', 'was', 'guarded', 'applause.Sure', 'von', 'Trier', 'post-Dogma', '95', 'film', 'still', 'many', 'tenets', 'minimalist', 'movement', 'was', 'cofounder', 'doing', 'so', 'are', 'moments', 'film', 'reek', 'artistic', 'self-importance', 'even', 'most', 'hardened', 'cynic', 'can', 'not', 'walk', 'film', 'being', 'affected', 'shattering', 'power', 'Bjork', 'performance', 'ingenious', 'directorial', 'artistry', 'Trier', 'evinces', 'telling', 'story', 'more', 'impressively', 'making', 'care', 'Selma', 'Czech', 'immigrant', 'factory', 'worker', 'who', 'slowly', 'losing', 'eyesight', 'Bjork', 'able', 'surpass', 'melodramatic', 'tendencies', 'script', 'piece', 'together', 'human', 'portrait', 'so', 'honest', 'poignant', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'walk', 'film', 'being', 'haunted', 'it.Sure', 'film', 'deals', 'tough', 'subject', 'matter', 'often', 'quite', 'sad', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'depressing', 'term', 'quot', 'depressing', 'quot', 'applies', 'situation', 'devoid', 'hope', 'burdened', 'overwhelming', 'weight', 'hopelessness', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'woman', 'laden', 'miserable', 'circumstances', 'increasingly', 'worsen', 'film', 'von', 'Trier', 'always', 'clear', 'Selma', 'actively', 'control', 'destiny', 'consciously', 'decisions', 'lead', 'state', 'leave', 'end', 'film', 'knowing', 'fate', 'somewhat', 'more', 'bearable.It', 'art', 'house/indie', 'film', 'world', 'gradually', 'blending', 'mainstream', 'filmgoers', 'are', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'savvy', 'are', 'expecting', 'more', 'cinema', 'just', 'entertainment', 'people', 'are', 'also', 'becoming', 'overly', 'critical', 'films', 'point', 'emotional', 'magic', 'movies', 'slowly', 'being', 'phased', 'out', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'film', 'unabashedly', 'outright', 'artistic', 'extremes', 'disarmingly', 'honest', 'emotional', 'manipulation', 'capable', 'hands', 'gifted', 'compassionate', 'artists', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'Bjork', 'who', 'composed', 'performed', 'astonishing', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'restrictive', 'floodgates', 'contemporary', 'cynicism', 'one', 'weep', 'revel', 'delicacy', 'intricacies', 'human', 'condition']",N/A

What I like about von Trier is that he is not afraid to take chances, and he took some pretty big chances on this one, most notably casting Bjork in her one and apparently only film performance.  She was great! Too bad the rest of the cast couldn't measure up to her level of emotions, but then von Trier seemed to design it that way.  The story is a convoluted one and fails to make much sense.  Von Trier is after emotions and there are some very memorable scenes.  It doesn't have the tension of &quot;Breaking the Waves,&quot; one of the most riveting films I have ever watched.  Von Trier breaks the tension with whimsical musical scenes, which serve as day dreams.  I particularly liked the muscial scene in the stainless steel sink factory.

The ""Dancer in the Dark"" in question is also the light from the projector dancing on the movie screen. The narrative here seems somewhat controversial, but it's nearly disposable. The story is an excuse for Von Trier to pay tribute to ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"", probably the best Danish film ever made. Selma's story is ultimately a tribute to the power of cinema.Selma loves musicals (perhaps the most cinematic of all genres), and through her perseverance in her belief that ""nothing dreadful ever happens"" in a musical, she comes to be rewarded. Von Trier allows us to understand her plight &amp; sympathize with her, but also creates a plot that's clearly meant to be seen as narrative construct (as opposed to a plausible chain of events). In the film, ""reality"" is shown via shaky handheld digital Dogma-esque camerawork, but the ""fantasy"" sequences use a color palette that makes them appear even more real than the ""real"" scenes. The wonderful acting convinces us that these characters are real, but at the same time, they are all played by characters that are cast against type making us ever aware of the artificiality of the film.  Furthermore, all of the characters voice their opinions on film musicals.What von Trier's doing here is making us realize what Selma surely realizes. Although films are just films, they contain a very real ability to create an alternate reality filled with genuine emotion. While I personally find all this film theory exceptionally interesting, the great thing is that we can surely look at the film from a strictly melodramatic / musical perspective, and it still works quite well. Bjork's performance is absolutely incredible. It basically achieves its goal of being an equal to Falconetti's in ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"". The musical score is innovative, complex, and well integrated into the story.  The plot's got a great deal of emotional heft to it, but never descends into mindless sentimentalism.Dancer in the Dark is the best film by a director that has several masterpieces under his belt already. It's the best film of its year (2000), and deserved the Palm D'Or it won at Cannes.

One can feel watching this film what Von Trier has proudly admitted: he's never been to the States.  I'm no big nationalist and invite insightful critiques of American culture, or any culture, none of which should be exempt from criticism.--it seems to me that Von Trier is continually pandering.  His Dogme rules were an attempt to suggest that when he made films cheaply-and I've no problem with that, think, in fact, it is a lovely idea-they were somehow more artistic, and since he'd further adhered to his silly rules, they were even a cut above other independent films.  At best, it was a ploy for attention, and it worked.  His films sold more than they should have and his name grew bigger based on the buzz over Dogme.  Smart businessman.  With Dancer, he abandons the rules, and panders to a mostly European audience that wants to look down on America based on the stereotypes Von Trier embraces.--he's really a sort of Emperor who probably knows he's quite naked, though it may be that he really believes in his robes.

I'm not sure why, but I have a difficult time suspending my disbelief and accepting the random singing and dancing--I know it's not meant to be realistic, but I can't even consider it fantastic.That said, the musical interludes in this film make the movie. Without them the movie is nothing more than your average--though well-performed--parent sacrificing for their child story,  reminiscent of some Law and Order episodes I've seen. Von Trier's visual style would still carry the movie to viewability, but there really wouldn't be anything worth remembering. The acting, as I said, is quite remarkable, especially Bjork's and Morse's performances. The characters are believable and developed--Bjork the seemingly frigid and controlling mother who is, at heart, always thinking about her child--what's best for him, etc and Morse the once rich, now poor man who can't deal with his sudden debt, and is afraid that those close to him won't accept it either. The editing and directing are good--it's refreshing to see a filmmaker not only shy away from many film conventions, but openly disregard them (namely, von trier enjoys employing jump cuts, quick shot scale changes, abandons the rule of thirds quite frequently and offers skaking hand held cameras over pedastaled still ones). furthermore, he doesn't block or script the actor's movements (hence, the hand held cameras), which allows the performances to appear more natural and fluid than most hollywood productions. the cinematography is fine, and sets are built with precision. but without the musical interludes, Dancer In the Dark doesn't offer anything new (except von trier's directing--which of course is not new anymore, inasmuch as this is not his first movie). That is to say, you've seen all of this before. you know the characters, are familiar with the plot and will probably know how the movie's going to develop and eventually end within the first half hour.still the movie is made memorable by selma's musical fantasies. first off, neither the lyrics nor the music match traditional musical films. bjork's tunes are poppy, and von trier's lyrics are downright nerve-chilling. not only that, but the musical fantasies aren't forced as in some other films--they come only when they belong, only when they can further the story and/or the character. two or three of them should cause uncomfortable moments for the viewer, at least one should promote rivers of tears. finally, the style with which the musical bits are filmed is so original and compelling that the movie becomes something terribly important. the dvd includes a documentary on this style, so i won't ruin it for those of you that wish to buy or rent it. let me just say that through von trier's innovation the musical moments were filmed only once.as for the dvd:  it's definitely a good buy. the commentary is adequete, the documentaries informative, picture and sound quality both good.as a final note, stellan skarsgaard appears in an unbilled cameo.",3,"actually three and a half, but that's not an option",990403200,"05 21, 2001",2001,3017,"['Musicals', 'often', 'irritate', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'accepting', 'random', 'singing', 'dancing', 'know', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'realistic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'consider', 'said', 'musical', 'interludes', 'film', 'make', 'movie', 'movie', 'nothing', 'more', 'average', 'well-performed', 'parent', 'sacrificing', 'child', 'story', 'reminiscent', 'Law', 'Order', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Von', 'Trier', 'visual', 'style', 'would', 'still', 'carry', 'movie', 'viewability', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'anything', 'worth', 'remembering', 'acting', 'said', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'especially', 'Bjork', 'Morse', 'performances', 'characters', 'are', 'believable', 'developed', 'Bjork', 'seemingly', 'frigid', 'controlling', 'mother', 'who', 'heart', 'always', 'thinking', 'child', 'what', 'best', 'etc', 'Morse', 'once', 'rich', 'now', 'poor', 'man', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deal', 'sudden', 'debt', 'afraid', 'close', 'wo', ""n't"", 'accept', 'either', 'editing', 'directing', 'are', 'good', 'refreshing', 'see', 'filmmaker', 'not', 'only', 'shy', 'away', 'many', 'film', 'conventions', 'openly', 'disregard', 'namely', 'von', 'trier', 'employing', 'jump', 'cuts', 'quick', 'shot', 'scale', 'changes', 'rule', 'thirds', 'quite', 'frequently', 'skaking', 'hand', 'held', 'cameras', 'pedastaled', 'still', 'ones', 'furthermore', ""n't"", 'block', 'script', 'actor', 'movements', 'hence', 'hand', 'held', 'cameras', 'performances', 'appear', 'more', 'natural', 'fluid', 'most', 'hollywood', 'productions', 'cinematography', 'fine', 'sets', 'are', 'built', 'precision', 'musical', 'interludes', 'Dancer', 'Dark', ""n't"", 'offer', 'anything', 'new', 'von', 'trier', 'directing', 'course', 'not', 'new', 'anymore', 'inasmuch', 'not', 'first', 'movie', 'say', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before', 'know', 'characters', 'are', 'familiar', 'plot', 'will', 'probably', 'know', 'how', 'movie', 'going', 'develop', 'eventually', 'end', 'first', 'half', 'hour.still', 'movie', 'made', 'memorable', 'selma', 'musical', 'fantasies', 'first', 'lyrics', 'music', 'match', 'traditional', 'musical', 'films', 'bjork', 'tunes', 'are', 'poppy', 'von', 'trier', 'lyrics', 'are', 'downright', 'nerve-chilling', 'not', 'only', 'musical', 'fantasies', 'are', ""n't"", 'forced', 'other', 'films', 'come', 'only', 'when', 'belong', 'only', 'when', 'can', 'further', 'story', 'character', 'two', 'three', 'should', 'cause', 'uncomfortable', 'moments', 'viewer', 'least', 'one', 'should', 'promote', 'rivers', 'tears', 'finally', 'style', 'musical', 'bits', 'are', 'filmed', 'so', 'original', 'compelling', 'movie', 'something', 'terribly', 'important', 'dvd', 'documentary', 'style', 'i', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'wish', 'buy', 'rent', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'von', 'trier', 'innovation', 'musical', 'moments', 'were', 'filmed', 'only', 'once.as', 'dvd', 'definitely', 'good', 'buy', 'commentary', 'adequete', 'documentaries', 'informative', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'good.as', 'final', 'note', 'stellan', 'skarsgaard', 'unbilled', 'cameo']",N/A

If anything, ""Dancer"" confirms the uncomfortable and eternal proof that, despite the efforts of shallow critics, most European filmmakers have no clue how to make good, intelligently crafted movies.This movie aspires to be a cross between Robert Wise's ""I Want to Live"", musicals and Douglas Sirk melodramas, with a typically depressing tone found in many turgid European movies. Note that I said ""aspires"" and not ""succeeds"". Otherwise, this movie DOES succeed as empty-headed, incompetently directed garbage that has no respect for the audiences' intelligence or any normal human being for that matter. The musical numbers themselves are poorly choreographed, visually unappealing and horribly sang by Bjork, who gives a performance that would please orangutans. Critics defended these ridiculous scenes for being bold and different. I'm sorry but Rebecca Black was bold and different too and look where it got her.Many of these dopey critics even go as far as hailing the movie for its realistic, sympathetic portrait of a disadvantaged person in a compromising society. Give me a break. Explain to me what's so realistic of a blind woman covering for a guy who stole her kids' eye surgery money because he made her promise not to tell anyone of his own money problems. Where's the realism in that person refusing to confess to the judge when she is put on trial for his murder? Or her friend not believing that this blind girl did not commit a crime but that her loser husband did? Furthermore, how come she doesn't tell any of her other close friends about it in private? This movie is no more realistic than a Hollywood chick flick, except this time, both male AND female audiences will be in pain sitting through this godawful movie.And for a movie that claims to be realistic, ""Dancer in the Dark"" spares no expense at trying to get us emotionally riled up. Besides the hackneyed eye-operation subplot, there are scenes where Von Trier has the nerve to try to jerk tears from the audience. One of the most painful scenes in the movie is straight out of a ludicrous 1950s melodrama. This scene occurs in the end when Bjork is in prison. As she walks toward her execution, she falls down and the security guard acts sympathetic and tries to bring her back to her feet. As she stands on the platform reading to be hanged, Bjork sings a horribly off-key song in happiness before her death. Oh, please. And critics say ""Schindler's List"" was manipulative. I know I'm supposed to be moved to tears but when she was cut off and hanged, I was standing up and cheering that one of the stupidest characters in movie history was killed.Speaking of crap that doesn't work, you would think that this movie may have something to recommend in its cinematography, right? Wrong. This is one of the ugliest-looking movies I have ever seen. Think about it: this movie is so bad that not even the cinematography is good. Most European pictures, even some of the worst, at least provide some visual pleasure. The camerawork in ""Dancer in the Dark"" is so nauseating that Michael Bay movies seem more elegant. The non-musical scenes are shot in poorly lit, irritating shaky and sloppily edited to resemble a documentary while the musical scenes are in hideously bright digital video. Apparently, these shots were made to distinguish the real scenes from the fantasy scenes but something's not working when the whole movie looks like crap. There's even a scene where Joel Gray appears at the end to tap-dance and Von Trier doesn't have a clue how to frame him properly.Nevertheless, an idiotic shambles like ""Dancer in the Dark"" was guaranteed to win prizes by some of the most ignorant pseudo-intellectuals, even nabbing Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Of course, this would not be the last time Cannes would hand their prestigious awards to feeble movies, as was seen with Gus Van Sant's boring ""Elephant"" and the shamelessly cloying ""Fahrenheit 9/11"". Von Trier can rest easy, knowing that this abomination isn't the only movie to receive undeserving accolades from deadbeat critics.As for the rest of us, we will realistically stay away from this abysmal wreck and watch movies made by directors who know more about the human condition in their finger than Von Trier does in his whole brain. To me, that's more realistic than anything in ""Dancer in the Dark"".Strongest recommendation to avoid at all costs.",1,Dogma?

Give credit to Lars Von Trier for provoking such strong conviction in people; that proves he's doing something right.It's a given that I'd see this movie since I'm a Bjork fan, but even without Bjork this would be a great movie; but without her it wouldn't be as great either.Best Picture and Best Actress would've been completely worthy Oscar nominations for this movie, but undeserving movies such as &quot;Gladiator&quot; and &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; are norms for the Academy.I'd hate to sound trite, but heregoes: &quot;Brilliant.&quot;(This movie is)This movie is an intense study of humanity--how situations provoke the actions and emotions in us. Selma is not a weak character, as one reviewer claimed. How many of us would keep a word to someone with our life at risk? Selma refused to reveal Bill's financial troubles in court, which ultimately would've worked on her behalf.  She's a woman with the rare strength to keep a promise, regardless of the consequences. Selma was a simpleton with an iron will, but a tender heart. I won't give the ending away, but it will be one of the most intense cinematic experiences you will ever see.Bjork gave arguably the most powerful performance of last year.

528362,A27VMEB55OY9LS,B00003CXKR,Kathy-W,"[1, 2]","I won't put a Band-Aid on it: this movie is wrenching and depressing. I bought it solely to see what the fuss about Bjork's appearance was about. To their credit, her presence is definitely that of a real character, not some secondary blip. Her amount of dialogue makes her a focus of the plot, and Bjork's acting is adequate enough.Selma's philosophies about life are one of the big strengths of this movie - she has such a dismal existence that it's a joy to see her find comfort and peace through very simple means. For example, the sequence for the ""I've Seen It All"" song is actually a very warming moment because it's about as close as Selma and Jeff get in the entire movie. Selma lets her guard down quite a lot and - abstractly - lets Jeff in on her secrets. Her acceptance of her eventual fate is refreshingly practical without being mundane, and it's a welcome bright spot in the story.The semi-musical format confused me even though I knew about it beforehand. The songs are alright (and perfectly up someone's alley if Bjork is already part of the music shelf), but their appearances are downright creepy because they are often done in stark contrast to reality. Part of Selma's downward spiral feels like an insanity bid, and I don't know if this was intentional or not. There's neither enough structure nor enough music for this to be a ""musical"" in the traditional sense of the word. The plot is dense enough, though there are some jumps that are explained very poorly. It feels like this film might have been a little stronger if it was a little less artsy. On the other hand, its ""differentness"" does make it stand out more.The cast is alright, if not a bit jumbled together (really? David Morse and Catherine Deneuve in the same movie?). Peter Stormare is sweet as the shy Jeff.I suppose this is strong enough as a movie, but the last half-hour (approximately) is so harrowing that you won't exactly run back for frequent repeat viewings. Watch it when you're in a fortified mood, or just buy the soundtrack CD and glean what you can from the music alone. Lars von Trier is, by and large, too pretentious for my tastes and I can't honestly say that this movie makes me want to go check out his other works. Treated as a standalone ""one-off,"" this movie is passable. Again, Bjork is pretty good in her own weird ways.

Shaw,"[26, 30]","Lars von Trier's masterpiece is nothing less than brilliant, as it begins with a provocative ink blot, and a rising overture produced by the movie's star Bjork, that maps out the vicissitudes of the next two hours.  Von Trier's hand-held digital camera rumbles through Selma's(Bjork) drab world - as she is suffering from a degenerative eye disease - and treats the audience to close-ups and zoom shots of the disgruntled or jovial Bjork, a la Bergman.  Von Trier's unstable camera is the trade mark of his Dogma 95 movement, which stresses austerity and denies film contrivances.  However, what escalates this film beyond other von Trier masterpieces (Breaking The Waves), is its use of over 100 steadi-cams in the filming of Selma's musical fantasies, which are extraordinary.  This inextricable blend of camera styles is what makes the film so aesthetically beautiful.  The contrived fantastical music skits are impeccably choreographed and balanced perfectly with Selma's abject reality; they are also used to further drive the story or reveal character's emotions.  Von Trier seems to be poking fun at the Hollywood musicals, while simultaneously celebrating and paying homage to them.  Selma is a character that any dreamer can relate to, and by the finale &quot;Darkness&quot; seems to be the only plausible choice for her, since her musical fantasies were viewed in &quot;Dark&quot; movie theaters where she is most happy.

It's a poignant, almost documentary like film, about a factory worker who is going blind.  To escape the problems of life, she tends to daydream.  Fascinated with musicals, the main character often drifts into dreaming that her life is a musical.  This is the only fault of the movie, I think.  You can barely understand Bjork when she goes off into these fortunately very limited musical segments.

I, personally, can't stand films that are as unoriginal as the shipment of Remember the Titans my store got in the other day.  I don't think that film had any original thought to it.  But enough about football movies with racial issues.  You want to read a review about this film...neh, masterpiece in cinema by director Lars von Trier.  This film is magnificent.  It is heart-wrenching.  It is beautiful in every way, and that's not the half of it.  Bjork is the most believable actress in the history of cinema.  She is the only actress who could have played this role.  No one else could have done it the same.  Her talents surpass even the most seasoned actors and actresses.  Lars von Trier is a genius.  With his 100 cameras idea he made every scene feel real, like it was happening right then and there.  He is brilliant.  Catherine Deneuve was excellent.  David Morse showed such true emotion that it's a shame he wasn't recognized, nor was his castmates and director by the Academy.  Shame on them.  The music, which was nominated, adds even more depth to the film, instead of taking away from it and giving it it's own world as some films tend to do.  See this film.  Tell me what you think.  Don't hate me because I don't like films that preach out about segregation, not because I like segregation, but because I like originality.  Especially Remember the Titans, being as it is Based on a True Story.  Why not just have the coach and his players talk about their situations instead of have someone else act them out.  Anyway, I hope you see Dancer in the Dark.  I am not afraid to admit that I, like some critics at the film festival, broke out into tears at some points in the film.

Written and directed by Lars Von Trier, from Denmark, it is a creative departure from anything Hollywood has ever seen. It's shot with hand held cameras in natural light and the story is itself an overblown melodrama.Bjork is cast as a simpleminded Czech immigrant who has come to the United States to earn enough money to save money for an operation for her young son to prevent him from the inherited blindness that is fast taking over her life.  She also is rehearsing in a drama club's production of The Sound of Music and is totally enamoured with Hollywood musicals.  Her acting is outstanding, and she wins the hearts of the audience.  That's why it is so painful to watch the awful things that happen to her over and over again and finally result in an ultimate tragic end.The film, however, is not just about her predicament.  It is also about the American dream and Hollywood musicals.  Throughout the movie, and often in the middle of the saddest parts, the light shifts and everyone breaks into song and dance.  I know that the director was trying to make an artistic statement here, but it didn't work for me.  I was annoyed at these parts and bored by the musical interlude.  And the jarring effect of the inappropriateness of these musical numbers made the film even more depressing for me.At 140 minutes the film was too long although it held my interest throughout.  I was constantly saddened and found myself weeping at the end. And so even though I can see this was a fine video, I can recommend it only those film aficionados who are intrigued by the concept.

In Lars von Trier's controversial DANCER IN THE DARK, the director/screenwriter finds a fascinating way to blend the two USA trademarks.Von Trier is a guerrilla filmmaker. His movies never unspool smoothly or flowingly. His camera work is jittery, abrupt, unfocused, and at times amateurish. These seemingly bad habits work well for his movies, which are all operatic, over-the-top, and raw looks at human behavior and misbehavior.Like his earlier classic BREAKING THE WAVES, which introduced the world to Emily Watson, this newer flick debuts Bjork in a powerful, emotionally naked performance. Just as Watson seemed to morph into the mentally challenged, naive, fragile wife in WAVES, Bjork doesn't just play the physically ill heroine, Selma, in DANCER. She becomes this Czech laborer, a mother who is going blind and is desperate to spare her son from the same medical death sentence.Bjork, an edgy singer/songwriter, provides the music for this rethinking of American song-and-dance epics. For those folks who think the film treatment of CHICAGO was dark, they should rent this title. Here is a weaving of tragedy and tap dancing, catharsis and choreography, shrieking and belting. It's not an easy blending to watch, and von Trier wants his audience to be uncomfortable.Everyone in the movie sings and dances, at different levels of proficiency. The participants will never be confused with Gene Kelly or Leslie Caron, Fred Astaire or Vera Ellen. Instead, the whole cast (David Morse, Catherine Deneuve, Peter Stormare from FARGO)is set loose to express their rage, desire, confusion, regrets via lyrics and movement. Even while they are trying to carry tunes, they are still supporting the weight of the script.Bjork is a revelation in this movie. She dares to look dowdy, unkempt, and REAL throughout. Her lack of vanity alone should have scored her an Oscar. I think there are very few actresses who would have consented and then courted such unflattering camera angles and cinematography. Her performance is so rich and so palpable that when her character exhibits fear and horror and animal terror at the end of the film, I actually felt my own stomach twisting and turning.The last shot of this movie is so harsh, so brutal, and so poignant, that I felt my mouth drop open. I knew it was coming, but I still couldn't believe my eyes. I have seen a lot of movies, and DANCER IN THE DARK doesn't easily belong to any category. It is a musical, a crime flick, a slice of rural life, and a budding, interrupted love story.Don't rent this if you want happily ever afters. Bear in mind, the finale will stay with you viscerally ever after.It's that intense. The DVD is packed with alternate takes, commentaries, documentaries, and a device that allows you to go to Bjork's music directly.

And then, halfway through the film, I remember thinking : ""I've never seen anything like this, and I never will"". This movie is a unique, rare animal - no movie before or since it could ever capture its' essence, no film will ever touch you on such a primal level. ""Schindler's List"" comes close, but that was a historical telling.Bjork Gudmundsdottir, Iceland's famous musician plays the lead role to perfection. She won the Cannes Award for Best Actress by this. The soundtrack of this movie alone is worth the full price. Its called ""Selmasongs"" - do try to get it, and try to get past the amazing song called 'New World' without breaking down.From camera angles, to the musical score, to the plot, to the cast, everything here WORKS. Lars Von Trier made his masterpiece with this film, and since then has been unable to create anything remotely interesting or hard-hitting.

Affleck ""spiritcavegrl""","[1, 1]","Selma Going blind is one thing, but her going blind and raising a son that will lose his sight someday, too, without an operation to correct his vision when he turns 13 is tragic.  So, Selma-Gene's Mother-works a factory job, saves as much of the little bit of money she makes for his operation.  Then there is the desperation of her neighbor/friend.  He is a Police Officer, Washington State 1964 era, he is getting ready to lose everything he has including his wife.  Learning that Selma is losing her vision creates a demon in his mind, after asking her for a loan, and she says ""this money is Gene's"".  He threatens to kill himself.  Selma has a loving positive angle on life, no matter how bad things get she still has her imagination and her Musicals-where nothing tragic ever happens.  He finds where Selma hides her money and then waits for her to leave, steals it and puts it in his steel box, so his wife can see him counting it and feel proud.  Selma is forced to do something that she would never have dreamt of, but it is for the love of her son she is thinking at this point, nothing else.  Throughout the movie she has these visions of people dancing around her, she is the center of a musical, it is a magical and inspirational movie.  Everytime something went wrong she would simply go into her own world and daydream about her entire life as a musical.  This loving mother from Chechlslovokia? does everything she can to provide for her son, has a nice guy that eventually falls in love with her.  But she has no time for a boyfriend.  I think she gives in to that later, though.  The dancers are excellent, the Directing of this film is superb.  No matter what Selma goes through she still comes through with a smile on her face.

In &quot;Dancer In The Dark's&quot; case, the Palme D'Or winning musical from Lars von Trier that promptly sank without trace at the box office, I mean those who appreciate when a filmmaker decides to take a familiar genre and make a film that, whilst exhibiting a certain knowledge of its conventions, gives it a refreshing spin. And &quot;Dancer In The Dark&quot; is one of these films: a unique wedding of melodrama and musical follies.Lars von Trier's collaboration with dance director Vincent Paterson and music genius/goat (whatever you prefer) Bjork brings forth something no big film studio would immediately jump onboard to. As well as Trier's token drama, with added dashes of gentle comedy swiftly diminished by horrific violence, Trier's rugged camerawork in the 'reality' scenes (which rarely resort to &quot;Blair Witch&quot;-style blurriness) adds a documentary feel to the piece, aided by a wonderful performance from Bjork, some cast-breaking flourishes from Catherine Deneuve, Siobhan Fallon and David Morse and a showstopper from Joel Grey. The musical sequences, like many of Bjork's own promos, are beautifully filmed with enriched colour, as well as being thematically rich (see &quot;I've Seen It All&quot; and the unsettling &quot;Smith &amp; Wesson&quot;) and downright danceworthy (&quot;In The Musicals Part 2&quot;, quietly spectacular in a way only Trier could have done it).The film didn't find an audience anywhere thus far, Fine Line Features quickly swiping it from cinemas all to early after its release as well as FilmFour playing it for only a couple of weeks.

528383,A2H9LUUCYE0KJC,B00003CXKR,Mr Peter G George,"[2, 2]","Dancer in the Dark is a film that stays with you. It has some extraordinary performances which are utterly believable because they are so naturalistic. This is the merit of Von Trier's method of direction. He seems to have allowed the actors a kind of freedom to find their performance. It is as if the whole film is improvised, giving it an immediacy and directness which is quite uncommon. Moreover, the gritty style of the dramatic portions of the film, looking as they do like a documentary, contrast wonderfully with the fantasy musical sequences. Suddenly everything becomes brighter, the colour changes and Bj&ouml;rk's strange haunting music begins.This film is like no other I have ever seen. Technically it must be classed as a musical, but it is unlike any of the musicals which Bj&ouml;rk's character loves so much. It is almost as if Von Trier has created a new genre. There have been dramatic musicals before, of course, but the drama was of a different kind. The drama of, for example, West Side Story or South Pacific is theatrical and stylised. Dancer in the Dark is dramatically realistic and in the end this makes it all the more shattering.If the viewer is willing to go along with this film, willing to be swept up into its world, the result can be very powerful. I found myself to be emotionally drained and not a little disturbed by the whole experience. This is a measure of the rare quality of the film. It touches the viewer and evokes feeling which remain.It is possible to make one or two minor criticisms. There are far two many Europeans in the cast of a film set in America. Von Trier no doubt wished to use familiar actors, those who had appeared in his other films, but it rather counts against the films authenticity as a portrayal of the United States. Furthermore, Bj&ouml;rk's accent means that it is at times hard to believe that she is from Czechoslovakia. Granted she sounds foreign, but her voice is a mixture of Iceland and London. She does not sound remotely Slavic.However, these quibbles can be quickly forgotten, for Dancer in the Dark is a film which once seen can never be forgotten.",5,A Film Like No Other,986774400,"04 9, 2001",2001,2131,"['Dancer', 'Dark', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'performances', 'are', 'utterly', 'believable', 'are', 'so', 'naturalistic', 'merit', 'Von', 'Trier', 'method', 'direction', 'have', 'allowed', 'actors', 'kind', 'freedom', 'find', 'performance', 'whole', 'film', 'improvised', 'giving', 'immediacy', 'directness', 'quite', 'uncommon', 'Moreover', 'gritty', 'style', 'dramatic', 'portions', 'film', 'looking', 'do', 'documentary', 'contrast', 'wonderfully', 'fantasy', 'musical', 'sequences', 'Suddenly', 'everything', 'becomes', 'brighter', 'colour', 'changes', 'Bj', 'ouml', 'rk', 'strange', 'haunting', 'music', 'begins.This', 'film', 'other', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Technically', 'must', 'be', 'classed', 'musical', 'musicals', 'Bj', 'ouml', 'rk', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'almost', 'Von', 'Trier', 'created', 'new', 'genre', 'have', 'been', 'dramatic', 'musicals', 'course', 'drama', 'was', 'different', 'kind', 'drama', 'example', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'South', 'Pacific', 'theatrical', 'stylised', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'dramatically', 'realistic', 'end', 'more', 'shattering.If', 'viewer', 'willing', 'go', 'along', 'film', 'willing', 'be', 'swept', 'up', 'world', 'result', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'powerful', 'found', 'be', 'emotionally', 'drained', 'not', 'little', 'disturbed', 'whole', 'experience', 'measure', 'rare', 'quality', 'film', 'viewer', 'evokes', 'feeling', 'remain.It', 'possible', 'make', 'one', 'two', 'minor', 'criticisms', 'are', 'far', 'two', 'many', 'Europeans', 'cast', 'film', 'set', 'America', 'Von', 'Trier', 'doubt', 'wished', 'use', 'familiar', 'actors', 'who', 'had', 'appeared', 'other', 'films', 'rather', 'films', 'authenticity', 'portrayal', 'United', 'States', 'Furthermore', 'Bj', 'ouml', 'rk', 'accent', 'times', 'hard', 'believe', 'Czechoslovakia', 'Granted', 'foreign', 'voice', 'mixture', 'Iceland', 'London', 'not', 'sound', 'remotely', 'Slavic.However', 'quibbles', 'can', 'be', 'quickly', 'forgotten', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'film', 'once', 'seen', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten']",N/A

528385,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B00003CXKR,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[2, 3]","Selma, a single mother from Czechoslovakia, is going blind and she's convinced her genetic condition will be inherited by her son.  She works a dangerous job at the factory in a small American town, and takes on extra work in the evenings in hopes of raising enough money to secure for her child a surgical procedure that may save his vision.  Her neighbor's a cop, who takes a fatherly interest in her son, and an uncomfortable interest in her savings.  Knowing that this is a Lars von Trier film, the third in his ""Golden Heart"" series about self-sacrificing women, you know it won't turn out well.  At the same time, you aren't likely to anticipate the delightfully whimsical way in which this film pays homage to and parodies the musical genre.  Musicals are always about fantasy and how the real world gets transformed into something more than mundane.  Here, Lars von Trier goes almost overboard to emphasize the drab ordinariness of the surroundings - the dull town, the dingy factory, the simple minded determination of Selma (played brilliantly here by Bjork, who also wrote all of the songs for this film).  So when they erupt into song - and it is always clear that these are Selma's fantasies, until the very end when a sympathetic guard decides to initiate and participate in the fantasy - when they erupt into song it is a welcome release.  At the same time the music always builds from sound motifs that are very much in the setting (the hum and clatter of machinery, the hiss and click of a broken record, the percussive rhythms of a slow moving train).  That fact establishes a subtle bridge between the hand-held realism of the everyday settings and the precision and flamboyance of the musical scenes.All the performances are effective, especially that of Bjork - though I have to say that Catherine Deneuve's performance here didn't strike me as among her best.  She seemed to be going through the motions a bit, and I didn't feel as genuine the connection she was supposed to have with Selma - perhaps she didn't get along with von Trier?

The home-video effect, while really dizzy for me at least, gave the movie a very direct, straightforward quality that polished shots will never have. It makes you feel as if you're the one watching and filming the entire event with a camera. It brings you into the movie, as if you were there, holding the video camera, so much so that it really draws out your emotions and sympathy.Bjork's singing adds yet another layer of feelings onto a movie already fraught with tension. I listened to the album 'Selmasongs' before I watched &quot;Dancer&quot;, but when I heard the songs in the film again, they took on a new life. Especially 'A New World' which Selma sings at the end of the film, which is just about the most unforgiving, rawest scene I've ever seen, set off perfectly by Bjork's stunning voice and lyrics. Hearing the song in its original setting made me fall in love with Bjork's singing all over again.The film has been reviewed as being satiric, somewhat political (ie, anti-american?) etc, but for me it simply stripped the reality of life down to its barest essence: hope, perseverence, betrayal. Put the trappings (setting, plot, camera work etc) aside, just focus on the film as it is: a very raw, painful portrayal of life and living and it'll eat your heart out. It was so emotionally draining watching it that I had to stop the VCD at least a dozen times just so I could pause for breath, and still I could hardly bear to watch the betrayal scene.

I happen to be entertained by a good story, good directing and good acting as opposed to how many things can be blow'd-up in under two hours, so there are a number of movies I have liked that didn't make it big at the USA box-office. But I liked even the best of those movies as entertainment, just entertainment.While Dancer in the Dark is immensely entertaining it is not just entertainment. It is art so good it should be hung next to the Mona Lisa in the Louvre. I have read many of the Amazon.com reviews, as well as others. Most agree that Bjork should have won an Oscar. I certainly agree with this. Many reviewers, however, did not appreciate the bold directing, the gritty camera work, the editing. The movie wouldn't have been possible without the directing being just as it was. Bjork's acting would have been wasted in a vehicle that was simply the story we start with. It was the directing, the cinematic technique in toto, that took this story and made it something that was big enough for Bjork's talent to fill. I will even go so far as to say that while there might be another actress who could have played Bjork's part, there is not another cinematic team who could have provided this vehicle. Having said this, one should appreciate what Bjork brought to the totality of the movie in addition to her acting the role of Selma. But make no mistake, this movie belongs equally to Lars von Trier and I'm not at all sure he's gotten the respect he deserves.I don't think I own a single video outside of something taped off the TV to be viewed at a later time.

Don't get me wrong-- I think it may be one of the best movies I have ever seen, but it is SO much different than anything else I can hardly believe someone picked it up to produce and distribute.The movie doesn't know if it is a documentary, drama or musical, but somehow it pulls off being all three. The story is that of a Czech immigrant who works and exists only to pay for a surgery to correct in her son a genetic disease that will eventually render him blind. The acting in the entire film is flawless and it is cast perfectly. The camera angles and visuals were stunning and the soundtrack (by Bjork) is enchanting.I must disagree with other reviewers on a couple of points. The first being that this is a &quot;predictable story&quot; of a character &quot;too weak-willed to defend herself from the forces of 'darkness' enveloping her miserable life&quot;. The will of Selma is incredible. Out of guilt from bringing her son into the world, knowing he will inherit the same blinding disease she has, and pure love Selma dedicates her life to saving money to pay for the surgery. She sacrifices everything save occasional viewings of musicals which provide her the sanity she needs to continue. Even when put to the ultimate test- death- she continues. The second point is that there are no happy scenes. Completely false. The sheer beauty of Selma's mission and the musicals she produces in her head define love and happiness respectively. The end of the movie (I won't spoil it for you) is sad but at the same time happy in that Bjork has found her piece after being wronged in so many ways.The first 20 minutes are painfuly slow, but everything comes together.

Winters,"[3, 4]","After watching &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; I thought that Von Trier's movies are very good and very talented, but too dark and real for me. I liked the movie but at the same time I hated it for the dark/stark portrayal of everday life.I thought that &quot;Dancer&quot; will have the same effect on me and that's why I went to see it with some prejudice. I thought that it will be cruel and depressing but actually it soon became clear that the movie is quite opposite the idea I had created in my mind. Well yes, Bjork dies a very awful death and even her life can not be depicted in bright colors, but it is not this way for her. For her the world is full of colors and clear lines even despite her near blindness. For her the life is full of music and sounds and is in fact just the non-song pieces between the songs in some musicals. But when the singing begins, it is allright again. The most interesting visual effect is the difference between real life and singing scenes. The real life is filmed with a handheld 8mm camera and the singing scenes are done with steady betas, so the songs look more colourful and more real-film-like than the rest of the movie.Selma/Bjork speaks very much about her fondness towards musicals and that's why the singing scenes of the movie make it a happy one. It shows that we all have a place in where to hide, when everything else seems to go the bad way, the down way. And when the last song, the song that must be the greatest in a musical and at which ending the camera must fly up into the sky, is filmed with a handheld camera it becomes clear that &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; has a happy ending. That the clear line between musical and real life starts going hazy/blury, and that Selma has nohing to fear anymore. This is the grand finale and the camera starts to fly towards the sky.Everybody else watching the movie with me thought it was very depressing and they couldn't understand me, when I said that it was a film about an American Dream come true. Well, it is, and I liked it because I never knew before that this coming true can be shown this way.",5,The happy death,977356800,"12 21, 2000",2000,2108,"['watching', 'quot', 'Breaking', 'Waves', 'quot', 'thought', 'Von', 'Trier', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'talented', 'too', 'dark', 'real', 'liked', 'movie', 'same', 'time', 'hated', 'dark/stark', 'portrayal', 'everday', 'life.I', 'thought', 'quot', 'Dancer', 'quot', 'will', 'have', 'same', 'effect', 'why', 'went', 'see', 'prejudice', 'thought', 'will', 'be', 'cruel', 'depressing', 'actually', 'soon', 'became', 'clear', 'movie', 'quite', 'opposite', 'idea', 'had', 'created', 'mind', 'Well', 'yes', 'Bjork', 'very', 'awful', 'death', 'even', 'life', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'depicted', 'bright', 'colors', 'not', 'way', 'world', 'full', 'colors', 'clear', 'lines', 'even', 'near', 'blindness', 'life', 'full', 'music', 'sounds', 'fact', 'just', 'non-song', 'pieces', 'songs', 'musicals', 'when', 'singing', 'allright', 'again', 'most', 'interesting', 'visual', 'effect', 'difference', 'real', 'life', 'singing', 'scenes', 'real', 'life', 'filmed', 'handheld', '8mm', 'camera', 'singing', 'scenes', 'are', 'done', 'steady', 'betas', 'songs', 'look', 'more', 'colourful', 'more', 'real-film-like', 'rest', 'movie.Selma/Bjork', 'very', 'much', 'fondness', 'musicals', 'why', 'singing', 'scenes', 'movie', 'make', 'happy', 'one', 'have', 'place', 'where', 'hide', 'when', 'everything', 'else', 'go', 'bad', 'way', 'down', 'way', 'when', 'last', 'song', 'song', 'must', 'be', 'greatest', 'musical', 'ending', 'camera', 'must', 'fly', 'up', 'sky', 'filmed', 'handheld', 'camera', 'clear', 'quot', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'quot', 'happy', 'ending', 'clear', 'line', 'musical', 'real', 'life', 'going', 'hazy/blury', 'Selma', 'nohing', 'fear', 'anymore', 'grand', 'finale', 'camera', 'fly', 'sky.Everybody', 'else', 'watching', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'depressing', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'when', 'said', 'was', 'film', 'American', 'Dream', 'come', 'true', 'Well', 'liked', 'never', 'knew', 'coming', 'true', 'can', 'be', 'shown', 'way']",N/A

What brings this movie to life is the amazing performance by pop star BJORK. Bjork becomes the character and takes you on this amazing emotional journey that you forget she is acting the part. She is truly that good and I have to say puts most of the Oscar Winners in Hollywood to shame. Bjork truly shows acting as a Work of Art and just seduces you with her performance. Here is a description of this wonderful movie with a little help from the back of the DVD. Bjork plays Selma a factory worker in America and a single mother who is losing her eyesight from a hereditary disease. Determined to protect her 10 year old son from the same fate, Selma is working over time and saving her money to get him an operation. In the evenings, Selma escapes into a world where nothing dreadful ever happens,&quot; rehearsing for a production for The Sound of Music with her best friend Kathy (Catherine Deneuve). But when a neighbor betrays her trust Selmas life spirals out of control and the lines between reality and fantasy blur and Selma begins to believe her life has become a Hollywood Musical. This is a provocative mix of drama and musical theater in which the movie won the PALME D'OR for BEST PICTURE and BEST FEMALE PERFORMANCE for BJORK at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival. Catherine Deneuve also gives a wonderful performace as Selmas best friend and makes this movie that much more enjoyable.

528393,A1EHO1C89QIBOT,B00003CXKR,Randy Buck,"[16, 50]","All the raves for DANCER notwithstanding, it's very possible to frequently enjoy von Trier and Bjork under other circumstances, and love musicals, and still find this dingy, amateurish picture a misfire.  Bjork's a touching, sincere actress, with a surprising kinship in her work here to the best silent film acting, and, of course, an accomplished songstress in her own field.  But on the evidence of this score, she is to traditional musical theatre and film writing, with its concerns for craft and character, what Michael Jackson is to childcare.  She and von Trier have every right to experiment, to bend the form as they will, but I submit if they're going to toss all the rules out the window, they'd better have something more to offer as a replacement for technique than the incredibly feeble writing and muddled thinking on interminable view in this movie.  For instance, von Trier adamently refused to visit America, or do any research to get the production details right, and as a result, the heroine's frequent flights of fantasy are seriously undercut by the inauthentic atmosphere of the rest of the picture.  Deneuve as a factory worker's one thing, but the wrong contents in a new box of candy, or incorrect lyrics (and muddled plotting) for the heroine's beloved SOUND OF MUSIC, a work that's known in detail by most of the civilized world, seem like stupid, easily-prevented mistakes that take you, plop, right out of your suspension of disbelief.  For fantasy to transport us, shouldn't reality be rooted in what's real?  (Where on earth's the revival house in a rural factory town that's constantly playing Busby Berkeley?)  Lame, awful songs, terrible choreography, and when Joel Grey finally shows up to demonstrate how it's done, his number's cut in such a way that he looks as lame as Bjork when he dances.  It's a DISGRACE, in a time when real musicals can't get greenlighted, that the film of CHICAGO can't get realized, but we're treated to this misshapen, pretentious mess, complete with critical huzzahs.  I wish that the strident fans of DANCER could be fated to see it eternally running at their local multiplex, on a double feature with von Trier's equally loathsome THE IDIOTS, the way Deneuve and Bjork worship at old Warners flicks.

It tells the story of Selma (Bjork), an immigrant who works in a factory, even after losing her sight, to save money for an operation to prevent the same fate befalling her son.  When her supposed friend steals that money to prevent his wife discovering he is in finacial ruins, Selma demands he return it and tell his wife the truth.  He refuses, and she does what is necessary to help her son's future.  Interspersed is the wonderful score, composed by Bjork, which gives her character further depth.

528395,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00003CXKR,Reviewer,"[3, 3]","Altruism, benevolence, a mother's love for her son and pure, unadulterated evil are the key elements in one of the most dynamic and emotionally charged (as well as overlooked) films of the year (2000), ""Dancer In the Dark,"" directed by Lars von Trier.  Icelandic singer Bjork stars as Selma Yeskova, a single mother living in a small town in Washington State, who works in a factory to support herself and her ten-year-old son, Gene (Vladan Kostic).  Selma works her fingers to the bone, taking double shifts and doing whatever she can to save enough money for an operation Gene will need when he turns thirteen to correct an inherited, genetic condition that will eventually rob him of his sight.  And Selma knows only too well the effects of the disorder; even as she works towards accruing the sum needed for the operation, she is coping with the onset of her own imminent blindness.  Besides her son, her one passion in life is movie musicals, which she has loved since she was a little girl; she grew up with them, and now it is to them that she turns in her mind when life closes in on her and threatens to become unbearable.  When she is overwhelmed and overburdened, she hears music in the sounds of the factory and finds rhythm in the work.  In the musicals she finds the respite from concern she needs to carry on, escaping to a place where ""nothing dreadful ever happens.""Set in 1964 against a backdrop of the beautiful rural Pacific Northwest, the content of von Trier's film is so real and it is so visually engrossing that at times it's like watching a home video.  And it makes you more than merely an observer of Selma's life; you become involved.  You share the joy of a mother watching her son ride his first bicycle; you sense the ""community"" of her friends and co-workers who help make her life bearable.  Von Trier successfully manages to avoid any maudlin sentimentality, and instead tells the story in a voice that is straightforward and creates an intense, emotionally complex and memorable film that ultimately takes you to a place that, in the beginning, you would never have dreamed possible.  In a way, it all sneaks up on you, until suddenly you find yourself caught up and swept away in an emotional torrent.Discovering a great film is always exciting (and without question this is one), but when it includes an astounding new talent, as well, it is indeed a thrill.  And such is the case here.  For as Selma, Bjork quite simply gives one of the best performances of the year, and how she got passed over for an Oscar nomination is beyond me.  A gifted individual, she brings subtle nuance to the character, and conveys a humanity of singular depth that makes Selma, and the fact that she is so adamant in her undertaking, more than real and believable.  That the viewer is able to be drawn in and affected on such a personal level with this film is a direct result of Bjork's natural ability as an actress.  Granted, von Trier led the way, and her co-stars (especially David Morse, in a terrific performance as her friend, Bill) provided invaluable support, but the real connection this film makes with audience is through-- and because of-- Bjork.The supporting cast includes Catherine Deneuve (Kathy), Peter Stormare (Jeff), Udo Kier (Dr. Porkorny), Joel Grey (Oldrich Novy), Vincent Paterson (Samuel), Cara Seymour (Linda) and Stellan Skarsgard (Doctor).  Much of the strength of von Trier's film lies in the implied, as well as the overt aspects of it, and in the end, ""Dancer In the Dark"" will leave you with many things to ponder for some time to come, especially concerning those ""gray areas"" of the human condition.  Rationale, motivation, the distorted priorities to which it seems so many people are prone, as well as proof of the existence of true goodness that many do, in fact, carry in their hearts.  Emotionally devastating, this is a film that demands reflection.  Unfortunately, it raises many questions to which--just as in real life-- there are simply no real answers.",5,Astounding Performance By Bjork,987292800,"04 15, 2001",2001,4018,"['Altruism', 'benevolence', 'mother', 'love', 'son', 'pure', 'unadulterated', 'evil', 'are', 'key', 'elements', 'one', 'most', 'dynamic', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'as', 'well', 'overlooked', 'films', 'year', '2000', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'directed', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'Icelandic', 'singer', 'Bjork', 'Selma', 'Yeskova', 'single', 'mother', 'living', 'small', 'town', 'Washington', 'State', 'who', 'factory', 'support', 'ten-year-old', 'son', 'Gene', 'Vladan', 'Kostic', 'Selma', 'fingers', 'bone', 'taking', 'double', 'shifts', 'doing', 'can', 'save', 'enough', 'money', 'operation', 'Gene', 'will', 'need', 'when', 'thirteen', 'correct', 'inherited', 'genetic', 'condition', 'will', 'eventually', 'rob', 'sight', 'Selma', 'only', 'too', 'well', 'effects', 'disorder', 'even', 'towards', 'accruing', 'sum', 'needed', 'operation', 'coping', 'onset', 'own', 'imminent', 'blindness', 'son', 'one', 'passion', 'life', 'movie', 'musicals', 'loved', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'grew', 'up', 'now', 'mind', 'when', 'life', 'become', 'unbearable', 'When', 'overwhelmed', 'overburdened', 'music', 'sounds', 'factory', 'rhythm', 'work', 'musicals', 'respite', 'concern', 'carry', 'escaping', 'place', 'where', 'nothing', 'dreadful', 'ever', 'Set', '1964', 'backdrop', 'beautiful', 'rural', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'content', 'von', 'Trier', 'film', 'so', 'real', 'so', 'visually', 'engrossing', 'times', 'watching', 'home', 'video', 'more', 'merely', 'observer', 'Selma', 'life', 'become', 'involved', 'share', 'joy', 'mother', 'watching', 'son', 'ride', 'first', 'bicycle', 'sense', 'community', 'friends', 'co-workers', 'who', 'help', 'make', 'life', 'bearable', 'Von', 'Trier', 'successfully', 'avoid', 'maudlin', 'sentimentality', 'instead', 'story', 'voice', 'straightforward', 'intense', 'emotionally', 'complex', 'memorable', 'film', 'ultimately', 'place', 'beginning', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'dreamed', 'possible', 'way', 'up', 'suddenly', 'find', 'caught', 'up', 'swept', 'away', 'emotional', 'torrent.Discovering', 'great', 'film', 'always', 'exciting', 'question', 'one', 'when', 'astounding', 'new', 'talent', 'as', 'well', 'indeed', 'thrill', 'such', 'case', 'here', 'Selma', 'Bjork', 'quite', 'simply', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'year', 'how', 'got', 'passed', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'gifted', 'individual', 'subtle', 'nuance', 'character', 'conveys', 'humanity', 'singular', 'depth', 'Selma', 'fact', 'so', 'adamant', 'undertaking', 'more', 'real', 'believable', 'viewer', 'able', 'be', 'drawn', 'affected', 'personal', 'level', 'film', 'direct', 'result', 'Bjork', 'natural', 'ability', 'actress', 'Granted', 'von', 'Trier', 'led', 'way', 'co-stars', 'especially', 'David', 'Morse', 'terrific', 'performance', 'friend', 'Bill', 'provided', 'invaluable', 'support', 'real', 'connection', 'film', 'audience', 'Bjork.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Catherine', 'Deneuve', 'Kathy', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'Jeff', 'Udo', 'Kier', 'Dr.', 'Porkorny', 'Joel', 'Grey', 'Oldrich', 'Novy', 'Vincent', 'Paterson', 'Samuel', 'Cara', 'Seymour', 'Linda', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'Doctor', 'Much', 'strength', 'von', 'Trier', 'film', 'implied', 'as', 'well', 'overt', 'aspects', 'end', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'will', 'leave', 'many', 'things', 'ponder', 'time', 'come', 'especially', 'concerning', 'gray', 'areas', 'human', 'condition', 'Rationale', 'motivation', 'distorted', 'priorities', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'prone', 'as', 'well', 'proof', 'existence', 'true', 'goodness', 'many', 'do', 'fact', 'carry', 'hearts', 'Emotionally', 'devastating', 'film', 'reflection', 'Unfortunately', 'many', 'questions', 'just', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'simply', 'real', 'answers']",N/A

528397,A3OJ012QPTGMLR,B00003CXKR,R. J MOSS,"[3, 6]","Trust the perverse sensibility of von Triers to make a critique of a cherished U.S cinematic institution. He sets DID in the 1960s, the era of classic musicals whose narrative clashes of race or war were glossed over by the sweetness of song. Cognitive dissonance is the substance of his musical tragedy. He heightens the divisiveness by using a disabled Czech immigrant whose mindset on her adopted country is that of an 8 year old. At the beginning of the film it's difficult to accept that Selma/Bjork is old enough to have mothered a 12 year old. But Bjork's acting, in tandem with von Trier's legendary hand-held camera and documentary ambience, soon recruits our complicity to her heroics. Faced with congenital blindness, she works overtime to earn the dollars required for an operation which will save her son from the same fate. She will make the ultimate sacrifice to this end. By and large(true to the form of musicals), the narrative is devoid of confusing nuances. And it's more plausibly and artfully told than most screened musicals. The post-modern inclusion of a musical within the musical cleverly comments on the heroine's undoing; the jerky, home made grainy feel of the film mocking the extravagance of musicals. Bjork's acting warms to brilliance and her face is perfect for the myopic alien. If you are partial to her video-clips, you'll enjoy the parodic excesses of 'video-clip'sequences which I found disturbing. I find her croaking,stuttering and warbling insufferable, and her less strained singing quite moving. But the lyrics were banal and patronising.'Nothing bad ever happens in musicals' quips the struggling mum, as the world around her dissembles, and against ridiculous odds, the songs try to maintain such bouyancy. With magnificent unconcern, the actors resume the narrative oblivious of their'unnatural' burst of musicality. Given von Trier's penchant for pressing cinematic conventions, the irony of using a pop diva to clinch his sermon on musicals is a success. For this viewer, the constant and abrasive rug pulling made it a limited one.",3,Big Video Clip,1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,2082,"['Trust', 'perverse', 'sensibility', 'von', 'Triers', 'make', 'critique', 'cherished', 'U.S', 'cinematic', 'institution', 'DID', '1960s', 'era', 'classic', 'musicals', 'narrative', 'clashes', 'race', 'war', 'were', 'glossed', 'sweetness', 'song', 'Cognitive', 'dissonance', 'substance', 'musical', 'tragedy', 'divisiveness', 'using', 'disabled', 'Czech', 'immigrant', 'mindset', 'adopted', 'country', '8', 'year', 'old', 'beginning', 'film', 'difficult', 'accept', 'Selma/Bjork', 'old', 'enough', 'have', 'mothered', '12', 'year', 'old', 'Bjork', 'acting', 'tandem', 'von', 'Trier', 'legendary', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'documentary', 'ambience', 'soon', 'complicity', 'heroics', 'Faced', 'congenital', 'blindness', 'overtime', 'earn', 'dollars', 'required', 'operation', 'will', 'save', 'son', 'same', 'fate', 'will', 'make', 'ultimate', 'sacrifice', 'end', 'large', 'true', 'form', 'musicals', 'narrative', 'devoid', 'confusing', 'nuances', 'more', 'plausibly', 'artfully', 'told', 'most', 'screened', 'musicals', 'post-modern', 'inclusion', 'musical', 'musical', 'cleverly', 'comments', 'heroine', 'undoing', 'jerky', 'home', 'made', 'grainy', 'feel', 'film', 'mocking', 'extravagance', 'musicals', 'Bjork', 'acting', 'warms', 'brilliance', 'face', 'perfect', 'myopic', 'alien', 'are', 'partial', 'video-clips', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'parodic', 'excesses', ""'video-clip'sequences"", 'found', 'disturbing', 'find', 'croaking', 'stuttering', 'warbling', 'insufferable', 'less', 'strained', 'singing', 'quite', 'moving', 'lyrics', 'were', 'banal', 'patronising', ""'Nothing"", 'bad', 'ever', 'musicals', 'quips', 'struggling', 'mum', 'world', 'dissembles', 'ridiculous', 'odds', 'songs', 'try', 'maintain', 'such', 'bouyancy', 'magnificent', 'unconcern', 'actors', 'resume', 'narrative', 'oblivious', ""their'unnatural"", 'burst', 'musicality', 'Given', 'von', 'Trier', 'penchant', 'pressing', 'cinematic', 'conventions', 'irony', 'using', 'pop', 'diva', 'clinch', 'sermon', 'musicals', 'success', 'viewer', 'constant', 'abrasive', 'rug', 'pulling', 'made', 'limited', 'one']",N/A

528401,A2GQOI25E6UY25,B00003CXKR,RolloTomasi,"[9, 11]","Contrary to what you might hear from critics, who hailed and eviscerated ""Dancer in the Dark"" with equal gusto, Lars von Trier's musical melodrama has plenty to love-and plenty to hate.  It's not easy being on the fence with such a consistently polarizing film, but in this case, the fence is the only place to be.  Undercutting genuine pathos with unnecessary manipulation, ""Dancer in the Dark"" is hardly an outright success-but it bears the mark of a bold cinematic vision, even if said vision is given a rather misguided execution.Selma Jezkova (Icelandic pop singer Bj&ouml;rk) is a young Czech immigrant, slow-witted but warm and idealistic, who is painstakingly saving up for her son, Gene, to have an operation to reverse an inherited eye disease.  She herself is slowly going blind, which ultimately causes her to drop out of the lead role in an amateur production of ""The Sound of Music.""  Fortunately, Selma has her own musicals to take refuge in-lavish staged numbers, engineered from the sights and sounds of the factory where she works.  And as her eyesight worsens, she retreats further into these brief eruptions of her own vivid imagination, much to the chagrin of her best friend (played by none other than Catherine Deneuve).Then something horrible happens-but of course, you expect it to.  The melodramatic signposts are there from the opening frame, and that isn't really a problem in and of itself, although ""Dancer in the Dark's"" detractors have been quick to point out how cheap and contrived it is.  They're missing the point.  Von Trier flaunts his cheap trickery, flaunts every contrivance; he never once asks the audience to accept the film as plausible.  To criticize it on those grounds, therefore, is too simplistic.Unfortunately, ""Dancer in the Dark"" can also be faulted in the simplistic department.  In ""Breaking the Waves,"" von Trier guided another tortured female protagonist to undeserved tragedy; that film, though it had its problems, hinged upon deeper questions of spirituality, faith, and what God requires of man (or a woman, rather), and Bess, played by Emily Watson, had a God-given reason for subjecting herself to punishment.  ""Dancer's"" Selma has only the constrictions of the plot to justify her plunge into tragedy; she's an easy symbol, a paragon of virtue in a cruel and unjust world.  She does it all out of love for her son-but von Trier appears to be oblivious of the fact; after Gene's been introduced, we rarely see him again.  Ultimately, he's just a fulcrum for the film's plot machinery.It's a testament to Bj&ouml;rk's truly miraculous performance, however, that Selma, though she may be a mere pawn to von Trier, comes across as a beautifully realized and enormously sympathetic creature.  At times, von Trier's jittery hand-held camerawork becomes truly, unforgivably excessive-obtrusive, unnecessarily drawn-out closeups abound in the final scenes-but Bj&ouml;rk, through the sheer intensity and abandon of her performance, makes them emotionally devastating all the same.  You know a film's doing something right when it relies so unabashedly on manipulation and manages to move you all the same.As for the musical numbers-which are filmed in vivid colors and with steady cameras, to emphasize the contrast between the moldiness of reality and the fire of imagination-they're not as effective as they should be, for a simple reason that's held true for all musicals, classical or postmodern.  The songs aren't all that great.  Neither is the film's composition-the choreography is as sloppy as the ""Sound of Music"" rehearsal scenes, and von Trier's choice of angles and edits is startlingly inept.  Finally, on a sheer thematic level, Selma's musicals don't really give us much psychological insight-so she likes to sing, and she likes to dance with the world around her.  That's fine, but it's hardly compelling enough to hammer home as many times as ""Dancer in the Dark"" does.The wonderful exception is ""I've Seen It All,"" a lovely, quavering tune that's as hummable as anything ever to come out of a movie musical.  That this song (which undeservedly lost the Oscar to more Academy-friendly Bob Dylan) emerged from this muddled juxtaposition of raw beauty and embarrassing missteps is, perhaps, enough of a good reason for ""Dancer in the Dark&quot; to exist.",3,A study in contrasts,996796800,"08 3, 2001",2001,4325,"['Contrary', 'what', 'might', 'hear', 'critics', 'who', 'hailed', 'eviscerated', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'equal', 'gusto', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'musical', 'melodrama', 'plenty', 'love-and', 'plenty', 'hate', 'not', 'easy', 'being', 'fence', 'consistently', 'polarizing', 'film', 'case', 'fence', 'only', 'place', 'be', 'Undercutting', 'genuine', 'pathos', 'unnecessary', 'manipulation', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'hardly', 'outright', 'success-but', 'mark', 'bold', 'cinematic', 'vision', 'even', 'said', 'vision', 'given', 'rather', 'misguided', 'execution.Selma', 'Jezkova', 'Icelandic', 'pop', 'singer', 'Bj', 'ouml', 'rk', 'young', 'Czech', 'immigrant', 'slow-witted', 'warm', 'idealistic', 'who', 'painstakingly', 'saving', 'up', 'son', 'Gene', 'have', 'operation', 'reverse', 'inherited', 'eye', 'disease', 'slowly', 'going', 'blind', 'ultimately', 'drop', 'lead', 'role', 'amateur', 'production', 'Sound', 'Music', 'Fortunately', 'Selma', 'own', 'musicals', 'take', 'refuge', 'in-lavish', 'staged', 'numbers', 'engineered', 'sights', 'sounds', 'factory', 'where', 'eyesight', 'worsens', 'further', 'brief', 'eruptions', 'own', 'vivid', 'imagination', 'much', 'chagrin', 'best', 'friend', 'played', 'none', 'other', 'Catherine', 'Deneuve', '.Then', 'something', 'horrible', 'happens-but', 'course', 'expect', 'melodramatic', 'signposts', 'are', 'there', 'opening', 'frame', ""n't"", 'really', 'problem', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'detractors', 'have', 'been', 'quick', 'point', 'out', 'how', 'cheap', 'contrived', ""'re"", 'missing', 'point', 'Von', 'Trier', 'cheap', 'trickery', 'flaunts', 'contrivance', 'never', 'once', 'audience', 'accept', 'film', 'plausible', 'criticize', 'grounds', 'therefore', 'too', 'simplistic.Unfortunately', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'faulted', 'simplistic', 'department', 'Breaking', 'Waves', 'von', 'Trier', 'guided', 'tortured', 'female', 'protagonist', 'undeserved', 'tragedy', 'film', 'had', 'problems', 'hinged', 'deeper', 'questions', 'spirituality', 'faith', 'what', 'God', 'man', 'woman', 'rather', 'Bess', 'played', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'had', 'God-given', 'reason', 'subjecting', 'punishment', 'Dancer', 'Selma', 'only', 'constrictions', 'plot', 'justify', 'plunge', 'tragedy', 'easy', 'symbol', 'paragon', 'virtue', 'cruel', 'unjust', 'world', 'love', 'son-but', 'von', 'Trier', 'be', 'oblivious', 'fact', 'Gene', 'been', 'introduced', 'rarely', 'see', 'again', 'Ultimately', 'just', 'fulcrum', 'film', 'plot', 'machinery.It', 'testament', 'Bj', 'ouml', 'rk', 'truly', 'miraculous', 'performance', 'however', 'Selma', 'may', 'be', 'mere', 'pawn', 'von', 'Trier', 'across', 'beautifully', 'realized', 'enormously', 'sympathetic', 'creature', 'times', 'von', 'Trier', 'jittery', 'hand-held', 'camerawork', 'becomes', 'truly', 'unforgivably', 'excessive-obtrusive', 'unnecessarily', 'drawn-out', 'closeups', 'abound', 'final', 'scenes-but', 'Bj', 'ouml', 'rk', 'sheer', 'intensity', 'abandon', 'performance', 'emotionally', 'devastating', 'same', 'know', 'film', 'doing', 'something', 'right', 'when', 'so', 'unabashedly', 'manipulation', 'move', 'same.As', 'musical', 'numbers-which', 'are', 'filmed', 'vivid', 'colors', 'steady', 'cameras', 'emphasize', 'contrast', 'moldiness', 'reality', 'fire', 'imagination-they', ""'re"", 'not', 'as', 'effective', 'should', 'be', 'simple', 'reason', 'held', 'true', 'musicals', 'classical', 'postmodern', 'songs', 'are', ""n't"", 'all', 'great', 'film', 'composition-the', 'choreography', 'as', 'sloppy', 'Sound', 'Music', 'rehearsal', 'scenes', 'von', 'Trier', 'choice', 'angles', 'edits', 'startlingly', 'inept', 'Finally', 'sheer', 'thematic', 'level', 'Selma', 'musicals', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'much', 'psychological', 'insight-so', 'sing', 'dance', 'world', 'fine', 'hardly', 'compelling', 'enough', 'hammer', 'home', 'many', 'times', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'does.The', 'wonderful', 'exception', ""'ve"", 'Seen', 'lovely', 'quavering', 'tune', 'as', 'hummable', 'anything', 'ever', 'come', 'movie', 'musical', 'song', 'undeservedly', 'lost', 'Oscar', 'more', 'Academy-friendly', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'emerged', 'muddled', 'juxtaposition', 'raw', 'beauty', 'embarrassing', 'missteps', 'perhaps', 'enough', 'good', 'reason', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'quot', 'exist']",N/A
528402,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00003CXKR,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[7, 12]","An utterly shameless and unending grab at your emotions swathed in imaginary musical numbers.  Set in 1960's America (or is it 50's?), ""Dancer"" follows the misadventures of Selma (Bjork).  Both her and her son are slowly losing their eyesight - a predicament that only exacerbates a life spent in utter hopelessness.  To escape, Selma imagines herself as the center of many over-the-top songs - in which her sight is clear, her soul is loud, but the hints of her dreary existence remain at the edges.Sound familiar?I wanted to give this movie the benefit of the doubt, esp. since nobody has really given the musical-extravagansa a chance since the failure of ""Pennies from Heaven"", which this film lamely rips off.  Von Trier hasn't the nerve to try our patience with an anti-hero as unsympathetic as Steve Martin was in that flick, and the cards are so heavily stacked against Selma, that there's no point to even questioning her delusions.  Von Trier obviously had a nifty idea - how to riff on boffo-Hollywood movies while staying within the restrictive limits of Dogme (or, how to make an unnatural scene using enforced naturalism).  It's an idea that would have served this movie well were it not weighed down by a story that heaps injustice on our heroine.  Besides blindness, she faces exploitation at the hands of her landlord - a kindly yet feckless and gutless cop played by David Morse.  When Selma resists, the exploitation takes an absurdly tragic turn to murder.  Like ""Pennies"", ""Dancer"" climaxes in a trial, and both are sufficiently bleak to make the result a foregone conclusion.  Unfortunately, Selma lacks the character flaws that made Steve Martin's end in ""Pennies"" so fitting - he was innocent of the crime, yet of little else.  Von Trier in contrast demands martyrdom for Selma, even as her trial is a nonsensical depiction of the criminal justice system.  Perhaps a Danish judge has the singular authority to impose the death sentence with as much speed as he unrealistically believes capable of an American judge; fans of this flick may defend it as a fable, even though Selma's end and the sentiments it's likely to incite in viewers are quite literal.  It's almost as if LVT wants to create some incredible parable of American injustice, then blame Americans for somehow fitting his implausible parable.  (""Dancer"" is only one of several films LVT has helmed depicting the universal horror of mankind, but set in America; LVT himself has reportedly yet to set foot himself in America.)  Like some, I admit to feeling emotionally drained after this film - but the sense was more akin to being exploited, as I too were blinded and manipulated down a path to tragedy.",2,"Pitiful rip-off of ""Pennies from Heaven""",1116201600,"05 16, 2005",2005,2692,"['utterly', 'shameless', 'unending', 'grab', 'emotions', 'swathed', 'imaginary', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Set', '1960', 'America', '50', 'Dancer', 'misadventures', 'Selma', 'Bjork', 'son', 'are', 'slowly', 'losing', 'eyesight', 'predicament', 'only', 'life', 'spent', 'utter', 'hopelessness', 'escape', 'Selma', 'center', 'many', 'over-the-top', 'songs', 'sight', 'clear', 'soul', 'loud', 'hints', 'dreary', 'existence', 'remain', 'edges.Sound', 'familiar', 'wanted', 'give', 'movie', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'esp', 'nobody', 'really', 'given', 'musical-extravagansa', 'chance', 'failure', 'Pennies', 'Heaven', 'film', 'lamely', 'off', 'Von', 'Trier', ""n't"", 'nerve', 'try', 'patience', 'anti-hero', 'as', 'unsympathetic', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'was', 'flick', 'cards', 'are', 'so', 'heavily', 'stacked', 'Selma', 'point', 'even', 'questioning', 'delusions', 'Von', 'Trier', 'obviously', 'had', 'nifty', 'idea', 'how', 'riff', 'boffo-Hollywood', 'movies', 'staying', 'restrictive', 'limits', 'Dogme', 'how', 'make', 'unnatural', 'scene', 'using', 'enforced', 'naturalism', 'idea', 'would', 'have', 'served', 'movie', 'well', 'were', 'not', 'weighed', 'down', 'story', 'injustice', 'heroine', 'blindness', 'exploitation', 'hands', 'landlord', 'kindly', 'yet', 'feckless', 'gutless', 'cop', 'played', 'David', 'Morse', 'When', 'Selma', 'exploitation', 'absurdly', 'tragic', 'turn', 'murder', 'Pennies', 'Dancer', 'climaxes', 'trial', 'are', 'sufficiently', 'bleak', 'make', 'result', 'foregone', 'conclusion', 'Unfortunately', 'Selma', 'character', 'flaws', 'made', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'end', 'Pennies', 'so', 'fitting', 'was', 'innocent', 'crime', 'yet', 'little', 'else', 'Von', 'Trier', 'contrast', 'demands', 'martyrdom', 'Selma', 'even', 'trial', 'nonsensical', 'depiction', 'criminal', 'justice', 'system', 'Perhaps', 'Danish', 'judge', 'singular', 'authority', 'impose', 'death', 'sentence', 'as', 'much', 'speed', 'unrealistically', 'capable', 'American', 'judge', 'fans', 'flick', 'may', 'defend', 'fable', 'even', 'Selma', 'end', 'sentiments', 'likely', 'incite', 'viewers', 'are', 'quite', 'literal', 'almost', 'LVT', 'create', 'incredible', 'parable', 'American', 'injustice', 'then', 'blame', 'Americans', 'somehow', 'fitting', 'implausible', 'parable', 'Dancer', 'only', 'one', 'several', 'films', 'LVT', 'helmed', 'depicting', 'universal', 'horror', 'mankind', 'set', 'America', 'LVT', 'reportedly', 'yet', 'set', 'foot', 'America', 'admit', 'feeling', 'emotionally', 'drained', 'film', 'sense', 'was', 'more', 'akin', 'being', 'exploited', 'too', 'were', 'blinded', 'manipulated', 'down', 'path', 'tragedy']",N/A

If you are looking for a film that explores new territory, this is a good place to start.The story-line of the film is of operatic proprotions.  Bjork (in a riveting performance) plays Selma, a Czech immigrant who is going blind.  Her son suffers from the same condition, and she is working double shifts to earn the money for the operation that will spare him from suffering her fate.  Her situation is desperate as the film opens, and it goes downhill from there.  Along the way, the themes of guilt and redemption are explored from many different angles.  The end is shattering.The scale of the tragedy is larger than life.  The filmwork is jarring.  Selma's one pleasure in life comes from the musicals, and the film incorporates a series of spectacular musical numbers in which the film lurches from gray to technicolor.  The stylized nature of the presentation serves to draw us even more deeply into Selma's very private world.The musical numbers are all freshly staged -- Lars von Trier used multiple cameras to film them all in one take, and then edited together the results.  The musical for ""I've Seen it All"" is one for the ages, but all the rest are memorable as well.  (It was unfortunate that Bjork chose the infamous swan-suit for her performance of this song at the Oscars.)You might well hate this film.  You might well love this film.

528405,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00003CXKR,Samuel McKewon,"[4, 6]","&quot;Dancer In the Dark&quot; is a movie creature unlike any other, a marriage of musical, Steinbeck, socialism and fantasy - a paean to the working class and the power of song. Lars Von Trier's film is steadfastly anti-capitalist, anti-death penalty and, by extension, anti-American. There are at least two good reasons to hate it, yet it is uncompromising, ambitiously realized, and technically masterful.The story is stolen from the silent melodramas of cinema's birth: Set in the upstate Washington of the 1950s, factory worker and Czech immigrant Selma, played by pop star Bjork with something resembling transcendence, suffers from a hereditary eye disease that is slowly making her go blind. Her young son suffers as well and will too go blind without an operation that Selma has saved, penny by penny, her entire adult life to provide.But there is a capitalist threat, manifested in Selma's &quot;friendly&quot; policeman neighbor (David Morse), who has led his materialistic wife to believe he has a fortune stowed away in his workshed. But the lockbox is empty, and the cop, frantic, learns of Selma's stash. He'll steal - and kill - for it, cementing Von Trier's assertion that &quot;wants&quot; can and do have a more lethal undercurrent than &quot;needs.&quot;Von Trier integrates this story, shot in drained-out, grimy realism, with full-production musical numbers that ostensibly take place in Selma's head whenever her words fail to explain an emotion or situation. Bjork wrote the songs - some are grating, but &quot;I've Seen It All&quot; and &quot;In The Musicals, Part II&quot; are the two brilliant sides to Selma's characters - and Von Trier staged them with 100 cameras surrounding the set, creating an panoramic musical atmosphere in unlikely locations: a factory, a train bridge, a courtroom and prison, where Selma is held after killing the bogeyman cop in an operatic murder sequence.Von Trier's critique of democratic mores and justice is intricate and relentless; he indicts the swiftness with which Americans turn kindness into cruelty, and our attraction to scandal, and money. The murder trial fixates on whether Selma is a communist sympathizer, and whether a famous Czech dancer (Joel Grey, of &quot;Cabaret,&quot; in a fabulous cameo) is actually Selma's uncle. The verdict is preordained as Von Trier stuffs the angst a little further under our fingers; Selma's final days are not only a countdown to her death by hanging, but to the very day her son's condition becomes irreversible.The plot, clearly, flies in the face of credulity. But Von Trier skill in melding silent movies, musicals and commentary is seamless. It is possible to dislike &quot;Dancer in the Dark.&quot; You could passably render it boring. But in an era mostly empty of original cinematic statements, the movie is undeniably a work of art, and an essential viewing for students of the medium.",5,"Bold, dramatic, artful.

It is a tour de force on a variety of levels--the direction and acting, for starters, are superb. Bjork stars as a Czech immigrant living in a small American town with her young son. Eventually she ends up on trial for murder, and considering the horrific ending, Lars von Trier has plenty to say about the state of the American legal system.I would have never expected Bjork to be a good actor, or capable of exhibiting such a multitude of conflicted and complicated emotions, but she does. I forgot that I was watching Bjork on the screen; she totally inhabited the character. However, she does put her musical talent to use in the film. Her character uses music as a way to cope--she invents dance numbers and songs and acts them out to get through difficult situations, and these numbers are just stunning.I know that opinion on this movie is very divided--I had a friend who absolutely hated it, thought it was manipulative and phony--but I didn't think so and I loved it.

The whole movie is shot on DV and is mostly a colorless, handheld and dreary looking ordeal but, the song and dance numbers are filmed with many cameras and are a wash with oversaturated color as Selma disappears into her dream world of the hollywood musical.  I've read where Bjorks music in the film is criticized but I would guess that any fan of Bjorks music would be pleased with the film score.

First off, this film is a musical.  A very modern day musical.  Lars von Trier was able to shoot the musical pieces using 100 digital video cameras placed around the set at one time.  This is mind boggling.  His idea was to do the number once and just capture it that way, but it didn't work out to well and they had to do mulitple takes.

I finally get to see what everyone has been talking about .  This movie is exhausting and coming home from a tired days work I was totally glued to the TV after being so enthralled by what this movie does to your senses.  At first, this movie looks like a boring documentary (with the exception of the beautiful overture and the colorful tapestries you see at the beginning).  But then this movie turns and turns and turns again, from one glorious scene to the other.  The musical numbers are like nothing you have ever seen in a musical.  Raw, deafening and most of all SURPRISING!  I think in the Hollywood hey day, musicals simply became all too familiar and predictable.  This movie annihilates all of that by slapping you with the most shocking dance and music sequences ever created.  The story is uncomfortable and very real.  I kept thinking of the &quot;Blair Witch Project&quot; with the camera-how it moves, adding a sense of realism and how the dance sequences are shooting from 100's of different angles.  Bjork's music (or should I say Selma's music) is something of a revelation for our times since musicals are supposed to be innovative and unique (think about it-how long has it been since you've actually seen a musical that is innovative and unique?).  What this movie capitalizes on is that Bjork holds all of those qualities and more.  But what makes this movie really work is it's dark and ultimately harsh story, continuously threading musical numbers and showing this faux hopefullness that Selma very much wants to embrace but can't.  She can't because of the abrasive world she lives in and the sad reality that keeps her from her hopes and dreams for her son.  This is not the Sound of Music or Xanadu or Grease or West Side Story or Gigi or that gawdawful musical South Pacific.  Although this movie has the essence of all of those movies it's different because the story isn't decorated with candy coated songs or a boring and frilly Hollywood story.  This musical is the real deal and delivers something that makes a huge reinvention of a timeless idea that somehow in the 70's and 80's got seriously skewed.With that said, this DVD rocks my socks off!  The sound of the musical numbers is sheer ear candy with my home theatre.  I jumped out of my seat when the first song arrived with Selma in the factory.  &quot;I've Seen it All,&quot; is a masterpiece of songwriting and it should've gotten the Oscar but how can anyone compete with Dylan?  &quot;Scatterheart,&quot; is breathtaking and when you see the scene with Bjork and David Morse you'll understand what I mean.  &quot;The Next to the Last Song,&quot; will most certainly make you cry, it did me and I am a rugby player, go figure:)  The extras are plentiful as with all of New Line DVD's, this has plenty of extras to play with and the documentaries are very thorough and most of all, INTERESTING!  After all was said and done, I finally went to bed at around 2am having seen something that was completely worth every penny in buying.  This film will remain a classic and although it didn't make millions of dollars in the theatre, it certainly has made a difference to those who continue to dream of the new great musical of the future.

I've just watched the movie the song was taken from, Dancer In The Dark.  It's out on video.  The singer's name is Bjork, and she is from Iceland.  She composed all of the songs that make up the sound track, and she plays the lead role.  Her on screen presence as Selma Jezkova is every bit as unique as she was on stage for the Oscars.Bjork plays a single mother with a twelve-year old son who immigrates to a small town in Washington State, from Czechoslovakia, in the 1960's.  She has an inherited eye disorder from which she is rapidly going blind.  Her son also has the disorder.  She believes Communism is superior to America.  She is obsessed with The Sound of Music.  She believes that the only good things in America are Fred Astaire, Broadway and Hollywood Musicals.  She came to this country because it was the only place that did surgery to correct the condition.  She works in a factory and has no health insurance.  She works double shifts and does piece work at home to save the money for the operation-for her son only, not for herself.  What I like about Selma is that she is an innocent who is passionate and driven about the right things.  She looks very mousy and disheveled but is very much alive and in love with life.  She lives in a supportive community but keeps everything related to saving money for the surgery a secret.The only things I didn't like about this movie is that many of the sequences were done as musicals.  Sections of the movie are a little slow, but the last quarter is powerful and worth waiting for.  I don't want to give too much away, but the ending is similar to the ending of The Green Mile.  It's the kind of ending which makes you think about the meaning of life.  There is also an excellent acting performance by a female prison guard that I found both credible and provocative.It's very interesting that Europeans made a movie set in a small town America. And, by the way, whereas Hollywood likes happy ending, Europeans like movies with sad endings.Bjork's singing reminds me of the Irish singer Enya, but I don't care for Enya, and I do like Bjork's singing.  She is much more passionate.  Dancer also reminds me of the movie Savior, both in the similarity of Bjork's singing to the Serbian folk songs on the sound track and to the movie ending.Bjork is the pop, ""Diva,"" of Iceland.  Dancer was her first acting role, and she won Best Female Performer at the Cannes 2000 film festival.  She has gone back to singing now, but I'd love to see her in another movie role.About that dress at the Oscars, I can't imagine that whoever designed and picked it had ever been out of Reykjavik, but all of the comments on the Internet, all from Europe, think the dress was absolutely gorgeous.

Paul,"[4, 5]","Bj&ouml;rk, an accomplished singer from Iceland who is best known for her progressive music, unusual style, and quirky personality, absolutely should have won Academy Awards for the her outstanding score and sublime performance in this phenomenally beautiful, yet utterly sad motion picture.  Why she didn't is beyond my capacity for reason, and is a testament to a commercialized Hollywood that rarely bats an eye at outstanding independent filmmaking.Working beside a knockout cast (including Joel Grey, Catherine Deneuve, David Morse, and Stellan Skarsgrd), Bj&ouml;rk plays Selma, a woman who copes with the increasing difficulties of her life through music.  She suffers from a degenerative blindness, which causes her to lose her job - a significant loss, since she had been saving money to pay for an operation that would prevent the same blinding disease from befalling her son.  All the while, the cruel world around her works against her undying selflessness, and, in the end, she unfairly pays the ultimate price.Not since ""West Side Story"" has music been more of a compliment to a movie than it is in this musical.  The music, arranged and composed by Bj&ouml;rk (and performed with original, effective choreography), is almost a being in itself, popping in at a moments notice when Selma hears the slightest rhythm of a passing train, a metal press, or even the light scratching of a pencil on paper.  It is through music that Selma finds her escape from an increasingly hostile world...and us along with her.This movie, phenomenally written and directed by Lars von Trier, raises the soul and the spirit, then brings it crashing to the ground as we witness the martyrdom of one of the most stirring and decent characters in recent memory.

Somehow she got stuck in this laughable film that is just so dumb at times I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I liked a few of the songs, and Bjork's angelic beauty and charm sucked me in. It's easy to feel empathy for her and her son. Her world is interesting and it's nice to visit in her dream like theatre productions of her imagination that cause things to go wrong in the real world. Where does this film go bad?1)Camera work is horrible. It movies and is never in frame of the characters heads or body. It's always off and you fee like it's a home movie of strangers.2)The songs get boring after the first few.3)The story get's rediculous when theirs a trial. And for some strange reason Bjork will not explain why she was saving money? Why is that so wrong? She could have told them without any consequences. It was just dumb that she allowed herself to be found guilty. They also let her testify against herself, Where was her lawyer? That was just dumb and implausible.4)It DRRRAAGGGEEED on for so long...just before it was done another song came up. Until you just want it to end already. They also get rediculous when she starts singing at her trial and at the inevitable ending. It just doesn't make sense.5)At times the film is sad, as when Bjork is forced to do the unbelievable. But the rest of the film makes it all feel like a joke.The trial stuff should never had happened, and a potentially interesting musical with a good actress was ruined by practically everything else.Rent it first, I'm glad I did.PS I love musicals, and fantasy weird films.

Dancer in the Dark is a sad, thoughtful, controversial, and strange film directed by Lars von Trier.The films stars Icelandic singer Bj&ouml;rk, Catherine Deneuve, David Morse, Cara Seymour, Peter Stormare, Siobhan Fallon Hogan, and Joel Grey.Dancer in the Dark is a musical and features original compositions by Bj&ouml;rk. The song ""I've Seen It All"" was nominated for an Oscar for best song.Upon release this film received many accolades & an equal amount of criticisms.It famously premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival and was awarded the Palme d'Or, along with the Best Actress award for Bj&ouml;rk.On the opposite side of the spectrum some reviewers found it to be overwhelming bleak in style, content, & stature.The story itself is quite downbeat but I feel what you see depends on how you look it.Either way, it is a film that all fans of film and imagination in general should watch at some point in their movie viewing career.Overall it is a very strong artistic statement that can really shift & possibly rearrange the way you feel about life.The story is about a poor woman named Selma who is going blind.  She has a rare hereditary disease that is causing her to rapidly lose her sight.Her only son could suffer the same exact fate unless he undergoes a expensive major operation.Selma works double shifts at a factory and saves every single penny to make sure her son will not go blind.To escape the monotonous dread of daily life Selma slips in and out of musical daydreams.If you are a fan of Bj&ouml;rk's music you will enjoy the experimental musical element of Dancer in the Dark.Throughout the film Selma is faced with an increasingly complex set of impossible decisions.When it comes down to it, she must make the ultimate choice.The concise point made in a direct & striking fashion that you will never forget: For true love sacrifices have to be made.Bj&ouml;rk described the process of making this film as the most difficult thing she ever did life.Dancer in the Dark is extreme, goes all out, and you will never forget it.

528421,A1EB3EO0NZ1LO,B00003CXKR,The Movie Critic,"[6, 7]","""Dancer in the Dark"" is one of the ultimate films that divides people. Some think that the film is manipulative and implausible, while others are awestruck and incredibly moved. When I first saw it, I had practically no knowledge of what the film was about and had virtually no preconceived ideas. When the film was over, I was not only fascinated, but stunned for days afterward. ""Dancer in the Dark"" is a film that has affected me more than anything else I have ever seen. What Lars Von Trier has created is the greatest example of on-screen emotion ever.The central character is Selma, played by Bjork in the role she was born for. Selma is a single mother from Czechoslovakia who has migrated to America with her young son, Gene. They both have a genetic disorder that will eventually cause blindness, and Selma is working herself into the ground to save money to organise an operation to save Gene's eyesight. When things get too much for Selma, she incorporates herself and her surroundings into daydreams of Hollywood musicals, which is her way of coping with her circumstances. Selma's landlord Bill is going broke and is afraid his marriage will be threatened if his wife Linda was to find out. He confides in Selma and, when they have both exchanged their secrets, Bill starts to get ideas of borrowing the money from Selma, which brings about serious repercussions.""Dancer in the Dark"" is absorbing, ambitious, beautiful and emotionally assaulting. It is a very artistic and pure film. It is so unconventional from other films, and is therefore not very popular. It is filmed using the Dogma 95 guidelines, which were established in Europe. These guidelines focus on making films in a relatively basic way. Handheld cameras, natural lighting and shooting on location instead of using sets, are a few examples of the criteria. This technique is not something every audience will accept. A good deal of viewers will be put off by the sometimes chaotic camerawork and jumpy editing. But for those who can see it as an art form, it is a very welcomed style.This is certainly a film that deserves more recognition. Fans have heaped praise on it, but it seems in some ways, the film has almost been forgotten about. Even taking into consideration that the film may not be a hit with mass audiences, it's difficult to believe that this film is not  available everywhere. But whether you love or hate it, it's boldness and originality cannot be denied. Lars von Trier is a director that is to be applauded. He is not afraid to be different, and ""Dancer in the Dark"" is impossible to forget.Bjork is a woman of incredible talent, and she is absolutely amazing as Selma and deserves all the praise she has been given. Lars von Trier and Bjork did however, clash during production, and the disagreements did take their toll, as some of the musical scenes let the film down slightly. But overall, the film is an overwhelming knockout. It is the kind of film that could make almost anyone cry like a baby. Oddly enough, my first response to the film was not tears. Though I felt almost traumatised and wondered how I managed to sit through it, I just didn't cry. The tears did come however, on repeated viewings.If you love art house films or are looking for something that is out of the ordinary, ""Dancer in the Dark"" is worth watching. As upsetting and unpleasant as it is at times, it is a film that should be seen, if you can handle it.",5,"Once seen, absolutely never forgotten.",1136160000,"01 2, 2006",2006,3438,"['Dancer', 'Dark', 'one', 'ultimate', 'films', 'people', 'think', 'film', 'manipulative', 'implausible', 'others', 'are', 'awestruck', 'incredibly', 'moved', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'had', 'practically', 'knowledge', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'about', 'had', 'virtually', 'no', 'preconceived', 'ideas', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'fascinated', 'stunned', 'days', 'afterward', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'film', 'affected', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'What', 'Lars', 'Von', 'Trier', 'created', 'greatest', 'example', 'on-screen', 'emotion', 'ever.The', 'central', 'character', 'Selma', 'played', 'Bjork', 'role', 'was', 'born', 'Selma', 'single', 'mother', 'Czechoslovakia', 'who', 'migrated', 'America', 'young', 'son', 'Gene', 'have', 'genetic', 'disorder', 'will', 'eventually', 'cause', 'blindness', 'Selma', 'working', 'ground', 'save', 'money', 'organise', 'operation', 'save', 'Gene', 'eyesight', 'When', 'things', 'get', 'too', 'much', 'Selma', 'surroundings', 'daydreams', 'Hollywood', 'musicals', 'way', 'coping', 'circumstances', 'Selma', 'landlord', 'Bill', 'going', 'broke', 'afraid', 'marriage', 'will', 'be', 'threatened', 'wife', 'Linda', 'was', 'find', 'out', 'Selma', 'when', 'have', 'exchanged', 'secrets', 'Bill', 'get', 'ideas', 'borrowing', 'money', 'Selma', 'serious', 'repercussions', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'absorbing', 'ambitious', 'beautiful', 'emotionally', 'assaulting', 'very', 'artistic', 'pure', 'film', 'so', 'unconventional', 'other', 'films', 'therefore', 'not', 'very', 'popular', 'filmed', 'using', 'Dogma', '95', 'guidelines', 'were', 'established', 'Europe', 'guidelines', 'focus', 'making', 'films', 'relatively', 'basic', 'way', 'Handheld', 'cameras', 'natural', 'lighting', 'shooting', 'location', 'instead', 'using', 'sets', 'are', 'few', 'examples', 'criteria', 'technique', 'not', 'something', 'audience', 'will', 'accept', 'good', 'deal', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'sometimes', 'chaotic', 'camerawork', 'jumpy', 'editing', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'art', 'form', 'very', 'welcomed', 'style.This', 'certainly', 'film', 'more', 'recognition', 'Fans', 'have', 'heaped', 'praise', 'ways', 'film', 'almost', 'been', 'forgotten', 'Even', 'taking', 'consideration', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'hit', 'mass', 'audiences', 'difficult', 'believe', 'film', 'not', 'available', 'everywhere', 'love', 'hate', 'boldness', 'originality', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'director', 'be', 'applauded', 'not', 'afraid', 'be', 'different', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'impossible', 'forget.Bjork', 'woman', 'incredible', 'talent', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'Selma', 'praise', 'been', 'given', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'Bjork', 'did', 'however', 'clash', 'production', 'disagreements', 'did', 'take', 'toll', 'musical', 'scenes', 'let', 'film', 'down', 'slightly', 'overall', 'film', 'overwhelming', 'knockout', 'kind', 'film', 'could', 'make', 'almost', 'anyone', 'cry', 'baby', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'first', 'response', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'tears', 'felt', 'almost', 'traumatised', 'wondered', 'how', 'managed', 'sit', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'cry', 'tears', 'did', 'come', 'however', 'repeated', 'viewings.If', 'love', 'art', 'house', 'films', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'ordinary', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'worth', 'watching', 'upsetting', 'unpleasant', 'times', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'can', 'handle']",N/A

I'm not a huge Bj&ouml;rk fan, but after watching &quot;Dancer&quot; I had to acknowledge her superior acting skills -- it truly seemed like a one-time experience that squeezed the most out of her. Similar praise goes to &quot;Cathy&quot; Deneuve who was quite good at what she was doing as Selma's friend. But the musical interludes must have been the element I enjoyed the most: they were simply good songs, the movie served as a great video to them, and the actual idea of incorporating this sort of a techno-Bj&ouml;rky act amidst this film, set in the 1960s in a rather prosaic context, was very interesting, to say the least. Plus, looking at the main character's delusions (who in fact seemed like an eight-year-old throughout the film; her son appearing more mature) was quite touching.Despite all this, you can't help thinking of Selma as Bj&ouml;rk, there's no way she resembles a Czech immigrant -- if they'd tried hard enough, they would've figured out how to properly pronounce Oldrich Novy, at the least! The supporting cast were so obviously un-American; the landscapes so conspicuously non-Washington State; and Bj&ouml;rk's accent, so bloody Cockney.... Apparently von Trier's idiosyncracies, such as the famed fear of flying, and thus shooting most of the scenes in southern Sweden, were kicking in big-time. He was making his art (the camera work, that I should have mentioned, too, rocked), not teaching us geography, I guess.To top off my criticisms, the story was so bland and simple and not special at all. This film was about acting, as I said.Oh well, it was a difficult movie to watch -- it caused a lot of mixed feelings. Still, it was definitely a fresh introduction to my viewing repertoire for this year.

528425,A3LAMZZQSCYRTX,B00003CXKR,wr,"[3, 3]","""Dancer in the Dark"" has proven to me that Lars Von Trier is the greatest filmmaker of our time. Here is a filmmaker who is trying to do something new and original and succeeds brilliantly. Unlike many of his peers he brings something to his art, contributes to the growth and advancement of the film medium rather than working in proven conventions that have been the norm since the begining of the sound era. This film caused me to question the way we look at films. What is film as an art? Must a film have beautifully unnaturalistic shot compositions and a script that moves from A to B to C to be considered ""art?"" Or can art be gritty and truthful like this and Von Trier's Breaking the Waves? In time films like this will get the recognition that they deserve. Once audiences minds are opened to different styles of filmmaking other than the typical Hollywood fluff.Dancer in the Dark has a simple dramatic story. It concerns a factory worker, from Europe, living in America in the 1960's. SHe is going blind and is secretly saving money to get her son an opperation that will prevent him from suffering from the same affliction. When the money is stolen the heroine, Selma, is forced to make a decision that sends her life spinning out of control. As her eyesight fails her Selma retreats into her mind, and her love for musicals, and the film breaks out into spectacular song & dance numbers. The song & dance scenes give the audience break from the drama, as they do for Selma in her reality, as the film heads toward its inevitable conclusion.See Dancer in the Dark and open your mind to the many possibilties of film. There has to be more than one way to make a film.  Dancer in the Dark is a start and hopfully it will open the doors for other styles of cinema.",5,One of the great films of our time!,1013731200,"02 15, 2002",2002,1774,"['Dancer', 'Dark', 'proven', 'Lars', 'Von', 'Trier', 'greatest', 'filmmaker', 'time', 'Here', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'trying', 'do', 'something', 'new', 'original', 'brilliantly', 'many', 'peers', 'something', 'art', 'growth', 'advancement', 'film', 'medium', 'rather', 'working', 'proven', 'conventions', 'have', 'been', 'norm', 'begining', 'sound', 'era', 'film', 'caused', 'question', 'way', 'look', 'films', 'What', 'film', 'art', 'Must', 'film', 'have', 'beautifully', 'unnaturalistic', 'shot', 'compositions', 'script', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'be', 'considered', 'art', 'can', 'art', 'be', 'gritty', 'truthful', 'Von', 'Trier', 'Breaking', 'Waves', 'time', 'films', 'will', 'get', 'recognition', 'deserve', 'Once', 'audiences', 'minds', 'are', 'opened', 'different', 'styles', 'filmmaking', 'other', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'fluff.Dancer', 'Dark', 'simple', 'dramatic', 'story', 'factory', 'worker', 'Europe', 'living', 'America', '1960', 'SHe', 'going', 'blind', 'secretly', 'saving', 'money', 'get', 'son', 'opperation', 'will', 'prevent', 'suffering', 'same', 'affliction', 'When', 'money', 'stolen', 'heroine', 'Selma', 'forced', 'make', 'decision', 'life', 'spinning', 'control', 'eyesight', 'Selma', 'retreats', 'mind', 'love', 'musicals', 'film', 'out', 'spectacular', 'song', 'dance', 'numbers', 'song', 'dance', 'scenes', 'give', 'audience', 'break', 'drama', 'do', 'Selma', 'reality', 'film', 'inevitable', 'conclusion.See', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'open', 'mind', 'many', 'possibilties', 'film', 'be', 'more', 'one', 'way', 'make', 'film', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'start', 'hopfully', 'will', 'open', 'doors', 'other', 'styles', 'cinema']",N/A

It's a doubly make-it-or-break-it role: an actress could only either stumble or excel in the role, AND the effectiveness of the portrayal of the role could potentially make or break the entire movie. In this case, Bjork doubtlessly excels and, as I believe, saves the movie to some extent.The first 10 or 20 minutes of the movie, as some reviewers have said, is quite hard to follow because of the unorthodox style of filming and the need to take in the background of the characters and all. But from that point on till the second third of the movie, things really take off. Emotions are strong and the musical scenes (especially the one with the lumberjacks) are sparkling.But then I think things go downhill after the scene where Selma confronts her neighbor, Bill. It's because the plot is simply just TOO contrived. I have nothing against contrivances in general. But given the nature of the story and the way it's presented, I just couldn't swallow the contrivances. Were the story told in the form of a musical (I mean the kind of Broadway musicals where the audience expects everything to be exaggerated) or accompanied with a surreal setting, I would not have as much problem with the unbelievable plot development. But from the start till finish, the movie was filmed with handheld cameras which has given so much feel of realism to the story, and Bjork's (and I would also say Catherine Deneuve's) touching, genuine acting simply doesn't go well with the surprisingly artificial plot.Way before the end of the movie, I already couldn't help feeling manipulated and thus couldn't emotionally get involved in the story again. From the incompetence of the defense lawyer to the lack of professionalism of the prison guard, it seems that every detail and every plot twist of the last third of the movie are there to merely emotionally stimulate the audience. To me, as said, it totally goes against the expectation of realism given by the acting and the way the movie is presented.Overall, the movie as a whole is inconsistent in tone and could have been a wreck without Bjork's superb performance. Given the delightful acting and some remarkable sequences, the sum of the individual parts is easily better than the movie itself.",4,Less than Sum of its Parts,1091577600,"08 4, 2004",2004,2336,"['most', 'reviewers', 'have', 'say', 'think', 'Bjork', 'performance', 'Selma', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'doubly', 'make-it-or-break-it', 'role', 'actress', 'could', 'only', 'stumble', 'excel', 'role', 'effectiveness', 'portrayal', 'role', 'could', 'potentially', 'make', 'break', 'entire', 'movie', 'case', 'Bjork', 'doubtlessly', 'excels', 'believe', 'movie', 'extent.The', 'first', '10', '20', 'minutes', 'movie', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'quite', 'hard', 'follow', 'unorthodox', 'style', 'filming', 'need', 'take', 'background', 'characters', 'point', 'second', 'third', 'movie', 'things', 'really', 'take', 'off', 'Emotions', 'are', 'strong', 'musical', 'scenes', 'especially', 'one', 'lumberjacks', 'are', 'sparkling.But', 'then', 'think', 'things', 'go', 'downhill', 'scene', 'where', 'Selma', 'neighbor', 'Bill', 'plot', 'simply', 'just', 'TOO', 'contrived', 'have', 'nothing', 'contrivances', 'general', 'given', 'nature', 'story', 'way', 'presented', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'swallow', 'contrivances', 'Were', 'story', 'told', 'form', 'musical', 'mean', 'kind', 'Broadway', 'musicals', 'where', 'audience', 'everything', 'be', 'exaggerated', 'accompanied', 'surreal', 'setting', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'problem', 'unbelievable', 'plot', 'development', 'start', 'till', 'finish', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'handheld', 'cameras', 'given', 'so', 'much', 'feel', 'realism', 'story', 'Bjork', 'would', 'also', 'say', 'Catherine', 'Deneuve', 'touching', 'genuine', 'acting', 'simply', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'surprisingly', 'artificial', 'plot.Way', 'end', 'movie', 'already', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'manipulated', 'thus', 'could', ""n't"", 'emotionally', 'get', 'involved', 'story', 'again', 'incompetence', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'lack', 'professionalism', 'prison', 'guard', 'detail', 'plot', 'twist', 'last', 'third', 'movie', 'are', 'there', 'merely', 'emotionally', 'stimulate', 'audience', 'said', 'totally', 'expectation', 'realism', 'given', 'acting', 'way', 'movie', 'presented.Overall', 'movie', 'whole', 'inconsistent', 'tone', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'wreck', 'Bjork', 'superb', 'performance', 'Given', 'delightful', 'acting', 'remarkable', 'sequences', 'sum', 'individual', 'parts', 'easily', 'better', 'movie']",N/A
