For a 1981 performance, the footage is great quality.  The sound too.

1585031,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,B009410J9I,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[1, 1]","When I saw this at the store of The Stray Cats Live in 1981, I thought that it would just be some raw coffee house venue performance because I never heard of them here in America til around the end of 1982. When I first heard ""Rock This Town"", I thought that it was some new material from The Kingbees. They being a rockabilly band out of LA, that was rather popular in Detroit when I lived there.Anyway, being an American band, and performing live from 1981, I couldn't believe how that huge audience there were already into the band like they've been hearing The Stray Cats for years. I was wondering, ""Were they the opening act for some other band?"" because there was a lot of people there too.Upon doing some research, I found that the Stray Cats released their first album in the UK in February of 1981.  We in the states didn't get their first album ""Built For Speed"" until July of 1982. 17 months later.  What's up with that? Was the American music industry resisting their style and dissing them, where they had to take their music overseas?Anyway, if you're a Stray Cats fan or a Brian Setzer Orchestra fan, this is a great concert to own on DVD. For years I've always wanted to own some early concert footage of such a great band like the Stray Cats.  Even their most recently filmed shows (like ""Live in Brixton"") is a treasure to own.It looks like this DVD is also down to just being a few copies left for sale. So, jump on it if you see it. If you're reading this review, than, guess what? You know you want it!",4,My fifth live DVD of Brian Setzer live.
