I found this movie to be much better and more moving than Living Free.To Walk with Lions, showcases the true story of George Adamson and his new successor in Africa-Gareth Patterson (who is named Tony Fitzjohn in the movie) on how they fate brought them together and where it took both of them. The various struggles that George and Tony have to put up with the poachers-bandits-Kenyan Govt-village men are shown here.How Joy and George are murdered too are shown as well as how the real life Gareth Patterson became acquainted with Lions even though he was almost killed by one.This movie is a must see for all animal lovers particularly those of lions and especially those fans of BORN FREE.Other recommended animal related movies are Born Free, ROAR, Two brothers, The Ghost & The Darkness, Running Wild, Maneaters of India (Natl Geog docum), Living with Tigers (Discovery Channel documentary).",5,An inspiring movie,1099353600,"11 2, 2004",2004,1019,"['who', 'loved', 'are', 'fans', 'movie', 'BORN', 'FREE', 'literally', 'part', '3', 'movie', 'LIVING', 'FREE', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'moving', 'Living', 'Free.To', 'Walk', 'Lions', 'true', 'story', 'George', 'Adamson', 'new', 'successor', 'Africa-Gareth', 'Patterson', 'who', 'named', 'Tony', 'Fitzjohn', 'movie', 'how', 'fate', 'brought', 'together', 'where', 'took', 'various', 'struggles', 'George', 'Tony', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'poachers-bandits-Kenyan', 'Govt-village', 'men', 'are', 'shown', 'here.How', 'Joy', 'George', 'are', 'murdered', 'too', 'are', 'shown', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'real', 'life', 'Gareth', 'Patterson', 'became', 'acquainted', 'Lions', 'even', 'was', 'almost', 'killed', 'one.This', 'movie', 'must', 'see', 'animal', 'lovers', 'particularly', 'lions', 'especially', 'fans', 'BORN', 'FREE.Other', 'recommended', 'animal', 'related', 'movies', 'are', 'Born', 'Free', 'ROAR', 'Two', 'brothers', 'Ghost', 'Darkness', 'Running', 'Wild', 'Maneaters', 'India', 'Natl', 'Geog', 'docum', 'Living', 'Tigers', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'documentary']",N/A
663410,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005LIRK,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","To Walk With Lions has a few questionable storyline segments dragging down the overall rating.  They involve lengthy segments of boredom and uninteresting storytelling.  That's the number one reason I'm not giving it 4 or 5 stars.These lengthy scenes include when the main character gets caught up in a relationship, and a funeral scene immediately after.  For some reason during this particular time, the storyline stops dealing with lions and focuses on trivial nonsense.Remove those two scenes, and I'm almost positive I'd raise the rating up to 4 stars.For some reason, any kind of attempt at building up character development is almost always pointless because you just don't care about anybody.Anyway, this film really shows how dangerous lions can be.  Whatever you do, do NOT take off running because they will run up from behind and attack.  You will witness a couple violent and bloody segments as a result.  Whoever says the male lions don't attack because the female ones are the hunters, well, guess again.  That's all I can say.The storyline mainly deals with trying to preserve lions in their natural habitat.  You will experience a few segments involving poaching, and one of them in particular is memorable but I don't want to spoil what it is.Shortern the time of this film by about 45 minutes, remove some of the pointless romantic scenes, and the quality would improve.",3,more talking than walking,1301184000,"03 27, 2011",2011,1389,"['Walk', 'Lions', 'few', 'questionable', 'storyline', 'segments', 'dragging', 'down', 'overall', 'rating', 'involve', 'lengthy', 'segments', 'boredom', 'uninteresting', 'storytelling', 'number', 'one', 'reason', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', '4', '5', 'stars.These', 'lengthy', 'scenes', 'include', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'caught', 'up', 'relationship', 'funeral', 'scene', 'immediately', 'reason', 'particular', 'time', 'storyline', 'dealing', 'lions', 'focuses', 'trivial', 'two', 'scenes', ""'m"", 'almost', 'positive', ""'d"", 'raise', 'rating', 'up', '4', 'stars.For', 'reason', 'kind', 'attempt', 'building', 'up', 'character', 'development', 'almost', 'always', 'pointless', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'anybody.Anyway', 'film', 'really', 'how', 'dangerous', 'lions', 'can', 'be', 'do', 'do', 'NOT', 'take', 'off', 'running', 'will', 'run', 'up', 'attack', 'will', 'witness', 'couple', 'violent', 'bloody', 'segments', 'result', 'male', 'lions', 'do', ""n't"", 'attack', 'female', 'ones', 'are', 'hunters', 'well', 'guess', 'again', 'can', 'say.The', 'storyline', 'mainly', 'deals', 'trying', 'preserve', 'lions', 'natural', 'habitat', 'will', 'experience', 'few', 'segments', 'involving', 'poaching', 'one', 'particular', 'memorable', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'what', 'time', 'film', '45', 'minutes', 'remove', 'pointless', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'quality', 'would', 'improve']",N/A

663415,AWWMG0023C35I,B00005LIRK,Inger Watts,"[28, 31]","I have just finished watching this video, and I feel that I have not wasted my time. This film is based on the true story of George Adamson. Adamson became famous as the man who set the lioness Elsa free in a film called 'Born Free'.In 'To Walk with Lions' Adamson has become an old and eccentric man who lives to free lions from zoos and circuses. He takes in an English milkman, Tony Fitzroy, who needs a job. When the new aide realizes that he is going to replace a workman who was killed by a lion the week before, he wants to leave straight away: He thinks that Adamson is crazy, but after some time Tony decides to stay after all.This is a beatiful film: The landscape is fantastic and the script is filled with good comments, laughter and exitement. After a short while you start to like George and Tony, even though neither of them can be called 'average guys'. This is a film that I want to recommend.

663418,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B00005LIRK,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","To Walk With Lions is a nice film in the better sense of the word. Focussing on George Adamson's later years trying to protect his lion reserve from poachers and government closure, it's a more honest and less Disneyfied take on the material than the whitewashed Born Free, as a surprisingly good cameo by Honor Blackman as a temperamental and manipulative Joy Adamson underlines. Richard Harris looks the spitting image of Adamson (he has the look of that type of white African) and surprisingly leonine, although his voice had gone by this point which does hurt some of his scenes, especially his laughably heroic death scene. It's not a classic by any means, but it's also not a lazy film even if the script isn't great.
