1069364,ARCZ2LAOX362F,B000PAAK50,Emilio Iodice,"[0, 0]","A Kid From Philadelphia,: Mario Lanza: The Voice of the PoetsI love these two movies.  The story is simple, it has a happy ending but most of all, it has Mario Lanza.  He was amazing.  These were his first films and they were hits.  I recommend them.  It is impossible not to enjoy this amazing star of yesteryear who is as fresh today as he was over 50 years ago.Mario Lanza was the most versatile tenor who ever walked on a stage. He could sing opera like the greatest tenors of all time. He was a master at ""crossing over"" from lyric opera to popular singing. As a result, he was a top recording artist and concert performer. After making these two movies, he made the film that made his a legend.  In the ""Great Caruso"" he also showed he could be a global movie sensation. The movie about the amazing Neapolitan tenor actually was about Mario Lanza. It turned the Great Caruso into the Great Lanza. He exhibited all of his splendid qualities.The movie inspired me to write my recent book about Mario Lanza: ""A Kid from Philadelphia, Mario Lanza, the Voice of the Poets."" It is not a biography. There have been several excellent bios about him. This is a book from a fan. It exhibits his qualities, talents, passion and love for his art. I wanted it to be a ""page turner"" that would be impossible to put down while listening to the magnificent voice of Mario Lanza.Anyone who loves Lanza the movie star, the tenor, the popular singer and the human being who did so much in such a short time will love these two films.",5,Enjoy A Young and Vibrant Mario Lanza,1381536000,"10 12, 2013",2013,1520,"['Kid', 'From', 'Philadelphia', 'Mario', 'Lanza', 'Voice', 'PoetsI', 'love', 'two', 'movies', 'story', 'simple', 'happy', 'ending', 'most', 'Mario', 'Lanza', 'was', 'amazing', 'were', 'first', 'films', 'were', 'hits', 'recommend', 'impossible', 'not', 'enjoy', 'amazing', 'star', 'yesteryear', 'who', 'fresh', 'today', 'was', '50', 'years', 'ago.Mario', 'Lanza', 'was', 'most', 'versatile', 'tenor', 'who', 'ever', 'walked', 'stage', 'could', 'sing', 'opera', 'greatest', 'tenors', 'time', 'was', 'master', 'crossing', 'over', 'lyric', 'opera', 'popular', 'singing', 'result', 'was', 'top', 'recording', 'artist', 'concert', 'performer', 'making', 'two', 'movies', 'made', 'film', 'made', 'legend', 'Great', 'Caruso', 'also', 'showed', 'could', 'be', 'global', 'movie', 'sensation', 'movie', 'amazing', 'Neapolitan', 'tenor', 'actually', 'was', 'Mario', 'Lanza', 'turned', 'Great', 'Caruso', 'Great', 'Lanza', 'exhibited', 'splendid', 'qualities.The', 'movie', 'inspired', 'write', 'recent', 'book', 'Mario', 'Lanza', 'Kid', 'Philadelphia', 'Mario', 'Lanza', 'Voice', 'Poets', 'not', 'biography', 'have', 'been', 'several', 'excellent', 'bios', 'book', 'fan', 'qualities', 'talents', 'passion', 'love', 'art', 'wanted', 'be', 'page', 'turner', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'put', 'down', 'listening', 'magnificent', 'voice', 'Mario', 'Lanza.Anyone', 'who', 'Lanza', 'movie', 'star', 'tenor', 'popular', 'singer', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'did', 'so', 'much', 'such', 'short', 'time', 'will', 'love', 'two', 'films']",That Midnight Kiss / The Toast of New Orleans

I believe he looked his best in this movie.  It looked like they lightened his hair a little and it was styled better than some of his other movies.  His eyes are so expressive and sexy in this movie also.  Love his voice.  Enjoy any movie he is in.  Toast of New Orleans was a cute movie that showed Mario could act pretty well to be a ""country bumpkin"" and change into a gentleman.  Love the scene of ""Madam Butterfly"" which I thought showed Mario had quite a bit of sex appeal. ""Wow"".

As a pre teen this voice was the most fantastic sound I has ever heard.  It was several years later I got into opera and could appreciate the other things he sang.  Italian songs are pretty melancholy for a kid.Finally with the advent of video I got to see this delightful movie.  Well supported with Niven, Nash, Rita Moreno and other character actors....and a marvelous dance sequence, the story bounces along enjoyably.  The highlight for me was the Butterfly duet, as Pinkerton was one of only 2 operatic roles he sang, the other being Fenton.That Midnight Kiss is not quite as well crafted and could use more Lanza singing.The movie Serenade has some very good opera stagings of arias.",5,My first favorite tenor!!,1249171200,"08 2, 2009",2009,773,"['Toast', 'New', 'OrleansI', 'had', 'heard', 'Be', 'Love', '20', 'years', 'got', 'video', 'pre', 'teen', 'voice', 'was', 'most', 'fantastic', 'sound', 'ever', 'heard', 'was', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'got', 'opera', 'could', 'appreciate', 'other', 'things', 'sang', 'Italian', 'songs', 'are', 'pretty', 'melancholy', 'kid.Finally', 'advent', 'video', 'got', 'see', 'delightful', 'movie', 'Well', 'supported', 'Niven', 'Nash', 'Rita', 'Moreno', 'other', 'character', 'actors', '.and', 'marvelous', 'dance', 'sequence', 'story', 'bounces', 'enjoyably', 'highlight', 'was', 'Butterfly', 'duet', 'Pinkerton', 'was', 'one', 'only', '2', 'operatic', 'roles', 'sang', 'other', 'being', 'Fenton.That', 'Midnight', 'Kiss', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'well', 'crafted', 'could', 'use', 'more', 'Lanza', 'singing.The', 'movie', 'Serenade', 'very', 'good', 'opera', 'stagings', 'arias']",That Midnight Kiss / The Toast of New Orleans
