342492,A1YB29BIDULEYE,6302874262,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[6, 6]","Alright. Granted, this is not an over the boards smash hit. But in all honesty, this is better and funnier than a lot of overrated so called comedies out there today. If you have found your way to this webpage, you probably already know the basic story. Cameron and Moore (son and father) through an accident of Astin end up in each other's bodies. (I will grant that this seems overly simplistic.) But there is something humorous about seeing the mature and responsible heart surgeon being acted by Cameron, and the hormone driven, and somewhat troubled teenager being played by Moore. (As well as them trying to find their way through people the true owner of the body knows.) If we are willing to accept that this isn't a Shakespeare comedy, we may find ourselves pleasantly surprised at the humor and comedy it does offer. And like well drawn comedy, there is a moral basis. (Moore and Cameron through their short and annoying journey do learn about each other.) One thing I must say about this movie is that it DOES NOT rely on excess obscenities or slapstick. Nor does it rely on someone getting into fights every 2 mintues.  Pick up this movie. It's worth a few dollars.",3,It Has Its Charm.,1106352000,"01 22, 2005",2005,1177,"['Alright', 'Granted', 'not', 'boards', 'smash', 'hit', 'honesty', 'better', 'funnier', 'lot', 'overrated', 'so', 'called', 'comedies', 'there', 'today', 'have', 'found', 'way', 'webpage', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'basic', 'story', 'Cameron', 'Moore', 'son', 'father', 'accident', 'Astin', 'end', 'up', 'other', 'bodies', 'will', 'grant', 'overly', 'simplistic', 'something', 'humorous', 'seeing', 'mature', 'responsible', 'heart', 'surgeon', 'being', 'acted', 'Cameron', 'hormone', 'driven', 'somewhat', 'troubled', 'teenager', 'being', 'played', 'Moore', 'As', 'well', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'people', 'true', 'owner', 'body', 'are', 'willing', 'accept', ""n't"", 'Shakespeare', 'comedy', 'may', 'find', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'humor', 'comedy', 'offer', 'well', 'drawn', 'comedy', 'moral', 'basis', 'Moore', 'Cameron', 'short', 'annoying', 'journey', 'do', 'learn', 'other', 'One', 'thing', 'must', 'say', 'movie', 'NOT', 'rely', 'excess', 'obscenities', 'slapstick', 'rely', 'someone', 'getting', 'fights', '2', 'mintues', 'Pick', 'up', 'movie', 'few', 'dollars']",N/A
342493,A7QOJMYXK3SI7,6302874262,Danny,"[5, 6]","YES!! Thank you Columbia/TriStar for putting this movie on DVD! I love this movie its one of my all time favorites. Classic 80's movie. Dudley Moore &quot;Dr. Jack Hammond&quot;is wonderful and very funny as the father, Kirk Cameron Shines as &quot;Chris Hammond&quot; his teenage son. They switch bodies when friend Sean Astin &quot;Trigger&quot; from&quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; brings it over to the brain-transference serum. Dudley Moore goes wild in his sons body and hits the town with Sean Astin while Kirk Cameron in his dads body goes to the hospital and makes arounds with his dads interns. This movie I highly recommend only for teenagers and older, not for younger kids because of some of the language and adult seens. Please don't confuse this movie with that rip off &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; thats Disney stuff is for kids. This movie is underrated and full of laughes, Theres no special features on the DVD But it has been Remastered in High Definition! The picture quality is Awesome!

342496,A228JH8V9Y700G,6302874262,MortensOrchid,"[0, 0]","The theme of this movie has been done many times (adult/child body switching and we see how each acts in each others' bodies) before and since, but still, this was a funny movie.  Kirk Cameron plays a teenager named Chris who has a surgeon father, Dudley Moore, who doesn't understand him like all parents of teenagers do.  One day, Chris's friend Trigger (Sean Astin post Goonies and pre LOTR) brings over this magic potion that his eccentric Uncle Earl brought back from one of his mysterious trips.  By accident, DM takes a drink of it and he and KC end up switching bodies, and mayhem ensues.  KC and DM did good jobs of playing the stuffy adult in the teenage body and the awkward teen in the adult body, there were some slapstick comedy antics and a few zingers here and there.  I think what made it hilarious was the fact that KC was trying to have a stereotypical horny teenage boy attitude when he was a devout Born Again Christian, but you would not know that if you didn't know a lot of things about him (and I admit, he was the reason I breathed during that certain awkward period.  But hey, don't we all have something embarrassing about ourselves?)
