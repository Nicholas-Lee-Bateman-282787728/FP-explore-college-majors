But they made this one way too long and he gets bored after about 10 minutes. Now if I put on any other Baby Einstein that we own he is mesmerized for the 25-30 min. it is on. This one is longer than 40 min and is missing the winning formula of the other Baby Einstein's.

He is 17 months and knows exactly what article of transportation is which and can pretty much say the name of every one of them.....&#34;car&#34;  &#34;boat&#34;  &#34;plane&#34; .....and I like this one too. As far as Baby Einsteins go this one seems a bit longer, is a mix of computer/real life images/puppets, and even has a funny rendition of 'the wheels on the bus' with the puppets.

925207,A20QETTR8VAVW1,B000AAF1UE,"viktor_57 ""viktor_57""","[1, 6]","Like many parents, I want my kid to get a leg up on my life, so I sat my six-month old down in front of ""Baby Einstein - On the Go - Riding, Sailing and Soaring"", left to get a pack of smokes, and then returned 45 minutes later fully expecting a rational human being with whom I could discuss the implications of relativistic space-time on human perceptions of causality.I strolled into the playroom and casually asked my drooling tyke, ""So, how do you square the idea of the universe emerging from a singularity, thereby implying a first cause, or at least, a prime event, with the later expansion of relativistic space-time and the apparent absence of an absolute reference frame?"" I figured I'd toss the lad a gimme first, just to ease him into a productive dialogue. Little Albert (not his real name) just looked at me, made a squealing noise, and pumped his pudgy arms up and down. I figured he was gathering his thoughts together, so I waited several minutes for a response. Albert looked away and put several fingers in his mouth.""Albert, did you hear my question?"" I asked, and he turned to me, smiling and gurgling. This conversation was not going well. I pressed him for another hour, asking his opinions on a wide range of topics, sure that I would raise a subject on which he would have an opinion. Albert seemed uninterested not only in physics, but also in music, philosophy, religion, biology, history, art, current events, and even sports. Perhaps he hadn't existed long enough to form opinions, so I probed Albert's budding genius using a battery of tests instead, including the Wechlser Adult Intelligence Scale, Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, Rorschach, Thematic Apperception, and Bender-Gestalt. According to the results, Albert was the very opposite of a genius, and barely qualified as even conscious. I tried to contain my disappointment. Still, I was thankful that ""Baby Einstein"" uncovered the true lack of potential in my stunted offspring, and now I can save time and expense trying to educate a lost cause. My heart is heavy, but I am thankful I live in a community that has excellent social services and will provide Albert with the structure and care he needs to live out the rest of his life in as meaningful a way as his severely limited intellect will allow.",5,I cannot fault the product for Nature's failings,1129507200,"10 17, 2005",2005,2305,"['many', 'parents', 'want', 'kid', 'get', 'leg', 'up', 'life', 'sat', 'six-month', 'old', 'down', 'front', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'Go', 'Riding', 'Sailing', 'Soaring', 'left', 'get', 'pack', 'smokes', 'then', 'returned', '45', 'minutes', 'later', 'fully', 'expecting', 'rational', 'human', 'being', 'whom', 'could', 'discuss', 'implications', 'relativistic', 'space-time', 'human', 'perceptions', 'causality.I', 'strolled', 'playroom', 'casually', 'asked', 'drooling', 'tyke', 'So', 'how', 'do', 'square', 'idea', 'universe', 'emerging', 'singularity', 'thereby', 'implying', 'first', 'cause', 'least', 'prime', 'event', 'later', 'expansion', 'relativistic', 'space-time', 'apparent', 'absence', 'absolute', 'reference', 'frame', 'figured', ""'d"", 'toss', 'lad', 'gim', 'first', 'just', 'ease', 'productive', 'dialogue', 'Little', 'Albert', 'not', 'real', 'name', 'just', 'looked', 'made', 'squealing', 'noise', 'pumped', 'pudgy', 'arms', 'figured', 'was', 'gathering', 'thoughts', 'together', 'waited', 'several', 'minutes', 'response', 'Albert', 'looked', 'away', 'put', 'several', 'fingers', 'mouth', 'Albert', 'did', 'hear', 'question', 'asked', 'turned', 'smiling', 'gurgling', 'conversation', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'well', 'pressed', 'hour', 'asking', 'opinions', 'wide', 'range', 'topics', 'sure', 'would', 'raise', 'subject', 'would', 'have', 'opinion', 'Albert', 'seemed', 'uninterested', 'not', 'only', 'physics', 'also', 'music', 'philosophy', 'religion', 'biology', 'history', 'art', 'current', 'events', 'even', 'sports', 'Perhaps', 'had', ""n't"", 'existed', 'long', 'enough', 'form', 'opinions', 'probed', 'Albert', 'budding', 'genius', 'using', 'battery', 'tests', 'instead', 'including', 'Wechlser', 'Adult', 'Intelligence', 'Scale', 'Minnesota', 'Multiphasic', 'Personality', 'Inventory', 'Rorschach', 'Thematic', 'Apperception', 'Bender-Gestalt', 'According', 'results', 'Albert', 'was', 'very', 'opposite', 'genius', 'barely', 'qualified', 'even', 'conscious', 'tried', 'contain', 'disappointment', 'Still', 'was', 'thankful', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'uncovered', 'true', 'lack', 'potential', 'stunted', 'offspring', 'now', 'can', 'save', 'time', 'expense', 'trying', 'educate', 'lost', 'cause', 'heart', 'heavy', 'am', 'thankful', 'live', 'community', 'excellent', 'social', 'services', 'will', 'provide', 'Albert', 'structure', 'care', 'live', 'out', 'rest', 'life', 'as', 'meaningful', 'way', 'severely', 'limited', 'intellect', 'will', 'allow']","Baby Einstein - On the Go - Riding, Sailing and Soaring"
