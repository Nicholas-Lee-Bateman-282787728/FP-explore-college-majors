Much to my exhaustion's dismay, I couldnt turn it off or sleep because I was so entertained! I thought it was fast paced and interesting, and for once I didn't really predict the twists in it, maybe because I didn't read the box or synopsis. A different sort of premise, not something I've really seen before. Jessica Alba was oddly intriguing, I usually find her overly sweet and annoying. Hayden I thought was very good and Terrance Howard I  always seem to like. The prostetics(sp?) for the surgery was really fake looking but beyond that I thought it was an a visually interesting & awesome movie worth a watch.

1126997,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0010X740A,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","I am completely shocked right now- I didn't think Awake was going to focus on drama bits involving the girlfriend of the patient and the patients mother.  I thought the movie was going to focus on *just* the anaesthesia awareness during the heart surgery operation part.  I thought the movie was going to focus on the helpless feeling going through the patients mind in the middle of an operation and how he couldn't do anything about watching his heart being operated on.  I was wrong.The first 30 minutes of the movie was devoted to getting to know the patient and the constant bickering between his girlfriend and his mother (they didn't get along with each other).  Needless to say, I went into the movie expecting something VERY different.Shortly after the movie started up and I began to see which direction the story was going, I almost turned it off.  I didn't however, and that turned out to be a wise move.You see, even though the patient was awake during the heart surgery (even though it took 40 minutes to actually GET to that part of the story) that wasn't the ONLY thing going on.  In the hospital (in the waiting room) his girlfriend and mother were trying to get to know one another better.  It was a challenge at first for the two women, but... well, I won't spoil anything.There was a good deal of confusion in the beginning when Jessica Alba's character walked into the operation room.  I was thinking to myself ""That would never happen in real life"".  But it ALL explains itself by the end of the film when the biggest twist of the entire movie was revealed that I TOTALLY didn't see coming.  Wow what a twist THAT one was!  I won't spoil it, but it definitely caught me by surprise.The actual parts where the patient was supposed to be talking to himself during surgery were pretty short and, shall I say, meaningless.  The patient trapped inside his helpless brain while lying on the operating table wasn't necessary to getting to understand the main part of the storyline better, and didn't play much of a role at all.  The description for this movie was wrong.  This movie is REALLY about the patients girlfriend and his mother and what develops in that major twist at the end and not so much on the helpless feelings while being awake under anaesthesia.Overall, good movie.  Surprised me a good deal in fact.  I was expecting something else entirely, but I ended up very satisfied anyway.",4,not what I was expecting,1250035200,"08 12, 2009",2009,2414,"['am', 'completely', 'shocked', 'right', 'now-', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Awake', 'was', 'going', 'focus', 'drama', 'bits', 'involving', 'girlfriend', 'patient', 'patients', 'mother', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'focus', 'anaesthesia', 'awareness', 'heart', 'surgery', 'operation', 'part', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'focus', 'helpless', 'feeling', 'going', 'patients', 'mind', 'middle', 'operation', 'how', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'watching', 'heart', 'being', 'operated', 'was', 'wrong.The', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'was', 'devoted', 'getting', 'know', 'patient', 'constant', 'bickering', 'girlfriend', 'mother', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'other', 'Needless', 'say', 'went', 'movie', 'expecting', 'something', 'VERY', 'different.Shortly', 'movie', 'started', 'up', 'began', 'see', 'direction', 'story', 'was', 'going', 'almost', 'turned', 'off', 'did', ""n't"", 'however', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'wise', 'move.You', 'see', 'even', 'patient', 'was', 'awake', 'heart', 'surgery', 'even', 'took', '40', 'minutes', 'actually', 'GET', 'part', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'ONLY', 'thing', 'going', 'hospital', 'waiting', 'room', 'girlfriend', 'mother', 'were', 'trying', 'get', 'know', 'one', 'better', 'was', 'challenge', 'first', 'two', 'women', 'well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anything.There', 'was', 'good', 'deal', 'confusion', 'beginning', 'when', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'character', 'walked', 'operation', 'room', 'was', 'thinking', 'myself', 'would', 'never', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'ALL', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'biggest', 'twist', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'revealed', 'TOTALLY', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'Wow', 'what', 'twist', 'one', 'was', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'definitely', 'caught', 'surprise.The', 'actual', 'parts', 'where', 'patient', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'talking', 'surgery', 'were', 'pretty', 'short', 'shall', 'say', 'meaningless', 'patient', 'trapped', 'helpless', 'brain', 'lying', 'operating', 'table', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'getting', 'understand', 'main', 'part', 'storyline', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'much', 'role', 'description', 'movie', 'was', 'wrong', 'movie', 'REALLY', 'patients', 'girlfriend', 'mother', 'what', 'major', 'twist', 'end', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'helpless', 'feelings', 'being', 'awake', 'anaesthesia.Overall', 'good', 'movie', 'Surprised', 'good', 'deal', 'fact', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'else', 'entirely', 'ended', 'up', 'very', 'satisfied', 'anyway']",N/A

1127003,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0010X740A,Chris Pandolfi,"[5, 7]","There's a medical phenomenon known as Anesthesia Awareness, in which a patient is consciously aware of things despite being under general anesthesia. The degree of consciousness varies from patient to patient; some recall only vague, distant events while others recall every single detail, right down to the pain of being opened with a scalpel. The word ""disturbing"" doesn't even begin to describe this because it's not the result of a twisted imagination. It's real. But ""Awake""--a film that uses Anesthesia Awareness as a plot device--is not real, which is probably why it doesn't work. What begins as an engrossing character study soon becomes a hopelessly misguided psychological thriller, with plot twists so implausible that they veer into ridiculous territory.Much like this review, the film opens with a statistic: over 21,000,000 people are put under general anesthesia each year, and while it succeeds in putting most into a state of complete unawareness, some 30,000 are not so fortunate. They have a conscious understanding of what's happening to them, and worst of all, they can't say or do anything because their muscles are paralyzed. We're told this, obviously, because the main character--rich, young New York investor Clay Beresford (Hayden Christensen)--goes through the same experience. He was born, you see, with a defective heart, and at age twenty-two, he needs to have a heart transplant. His mother, Lilith (Lena Olin)--who makes herself seem overbearing--insists that renowned cardiology expert Dr. Jonathan Neyer (Arliss Howard) perform the operation. But Clay opts for his friend, Dr. Jack Harper (Terrence Howard), who had previously saved Clay's life.This doesn't sit well with Lilith, and neither does the fact that he's in love with her secretary, Sam Lockwood (Jessica Alba). She and Clay have been secretly engaged for six months, which, as you can guess, makes their relationship difficult to maintain. Hiding their love from the world gets so tiresome that Clay finally decides to marry Sam on the spot. No expensive, elaborate ceremony with New York's elite in attendance--just a minister, a witness, the bride, the groom, and their love. Of course, the night of their wedding is also the night Clay is admitted to the hospital and prepped for surgery, because that just happens to be when a donor heart is being delivered. Clay is soon thereafter lying on an operating table with an oxygen mask over his nose and mouth, and he's asked to count backwards from ten as one of the nurses injects the anesthesia into his IV.The first few moments of the operation scene are effective, if incredibly unsettling. Clay quickly realizes that, even though he's paralyzed, the anesthesia hasn't done its job. He's still awake. He feels the discomfort of his chest being shaved without any shaving cream, and the iodine is cold and smelly. Finally there's the initial incision and the device used to hold the chest cavity open, and I don't think anything more needs to be said about that.In order to distract himself from the physical pain, Clay tries to focus on Sam, the girl he loves. And this is pretty much when the film loses its way, as his thoughts are soon interrupted by the conversation between the doctors performing the surgery. Did Dr. Harper just say that he altered the order of the donor list? Did he say that they should hurry up and kill Clay before anyone gets suspicious? If you think I've just given away the plot twist, you're wrong--the biggest plot twist comes later, something so over the top that it unfairly reverses what we thought we knew about most of the characters. It's not anticlimactic, but it's definitely inappropriate, especially since the first half of the story was so focused on establishing character. By the second half, we learn that this establishing has counted for nothing, save for an excuse to show how crafty a screenwriter can be.But ""Awake"" doesn't earn the right to be crafty simply because it fails to tease the audience along the way. It starts off straightforwardly then ends by shoving a slew of revelations into our faces at once; there's no mystery that builds itself up, no sense that there's something odd about the situation. The plot twist is self-indulgent and nonsensical, existing as nothing more than a way to shock the audience.It doesn't help that the film gets inexplicably surreal. At a certain point in his operation, Clay has an out of body experience; in spirit form--in which he's unscarred, barefoot, and dressed in scrubs--he exits his physical self and wanders the halls of the hospital, replaying both the recent and distant events of life. This is presumably a way for him to figure things out, to help him piece things together and understand what led up to the sinister plot against him. At times, he can also see what's currently happening, such as the fact that a tear has escaped his eye as he lies on the operating table. All this, in turn, becomes an unnecessary commentary on the bond between a mother and son, which in this case is heartfelt and creepy at the same time.And speaking of creepy, here's another fact about Anesthesia Awareness, courtesy of the Anesthesia Awareness Campaign, Inc. website: it's reported between one hundred to two hundred times a day in the United States alone. If saying this has managed to scare you away from hospitals, then I've done the job ""Awake"" set out to do. You now don't have to actually see it and be disappointed by everything else it has to offer.",3,Medical Quackery,1196380800,"11 30, 2007",2007,5507,"['medical', 'phenomenon', 'known', 'Anesthesia',

I'm glad I discovered it though, as I enjoyed this film thoroughly. Without giving the plot away too much, I must admit that I figured out a big piece of the puzzle rather early in the film. I think it's just because I've seen way too many movies in my life and have mastered the art of noticing the subtle clues and coming to the correct conclusion before it is made openly known. And as for the ending, well, there are some people who may liken a certain aspect of it to the movie John Q, but the rest of the movie is SO MUCH different, that it's really not a huge issue. A lot of people in the medical field (namely, the anesthesiology field) have been harsh on the film, blasting the science as false. I'm not a doctor, so I really can't say either way. But honestly, does it matter that much? It's a MOVIE, not a documentary. It's meant to entertain, not teach. That being said, this movie does its job. It entertains. Although I didn't care for Hayden Christiensen's acting in the Star Wars films, he really surprised me in this one. Is he the next Kevin Spacey or Denzel Washington? No. But he proves that he is talented. The same can't be said for Jessica Alba. I never had any problem with her, as I've always seen her in movies that didn't really require strong acting skills. This film, however, does require those skills. And she just doesn't have them. Terrance Howard, however, does, and he steals the show. He is superb, as usual. He has this amazing way of showing very strong emotions, without going to big, great, giant, grand measures and gestures. Somehow, he can say something massive with amazing subtlety. As for the film as whole, it's very exciting. It takes a bit of time to get to the exciting part, as it has to build up the story. I myself never really complain about movies that move slowly, but if you're one of those that do, be patient. It is worth the wait.

Joby Harold both wrote and directed this film and despite the presence of some fine actors, the film remains grounded.Clay Beresford (Hayden Christensen) has inherited his dead father's multi-billion dollar fortune and shares the wealth and control of his empire with his domineering mother Lilith (Lena Olin). Clay apparently has a genetically determined cardiac pathology, is medicated, and awaits a heart transplant. The only semblance of honest life Clay has is his love for his mother's secretary Sam (Jessica Alba) who, despite Lilith's objections, marries Clay after disclosing their relationship.  Clay's beeper warning that a cardiac donor is available cuts short their night of honeymoon and Clay is rushed to the hospital to his constant friend, Dr. Jack Harper (Terrence Howard), who just happens to be a heart transplant surgeon and who Clay prefers over Dr. Neyer (Arliss Howard),  the superior cardiac surgeon friend of his mother who has been the designated surgeon all along. The gimmick of the film is 'anesthetic awareness', a state of anesthesia when the patient is paralyzed but aware of the talk in the OR as well as the pain of the surgery. What Clay hears 'under anesthesia is a ridiculous, convoluted plot involving all the people he thought he could trust and about which he can do nothing: in order to keep the storyline rolling, the script gives him an out of body experience so that Clay can be his own detective in solving the myriad discrepancies of his situation.  The ending is very predicable and begs viewer indulgence.Perhaps the credibility of this story would have been better if the director and actors had paid more attention to OR technique: walking into an OR in street clothes, handling patients without gloves or masks, allowing outsiders to enter the OR during a transplant procedure, beginning surgery without documentation of complete anesthesia or before the donor heart arrives, etc. etc. etc. are such breaches of surgical rules that even the casual viewer of TV medical dramas knows.  But the real problem with the script is that we are left caring very little for any of the characters, despite the fact the roles are assigned to some heavy hitters! Sadly, the movie is just silly.

This is when patients are unaccountably left fully conscious--and physically paralyzed--during surgery, and Harold (who also wrote the script) has spun a preposterously entertaining yarn from this grisly germ of an idea, and manages to hold us in a vice-like grip for pretty much the entire film. How often can you say of a Hollywood thriller that you don't have a clue what's going to happen next? Awake is brazenly indifferent to plausibility, but you can't help but admire the film's audacity. Along with fantastic plot twists, Harold throws Hitchcockian flourishes and elements of Greek tragedy into the mix like a crazed chef. In lesser hands, Awake would have been a tawdry melodrama, but Harold believes in his material so fervently (in a way a more seasoned professional never could) that the film works on several levels at once. Ingenious as it is, it's not mechanical--it has soul.Harold brings such energy and focus to the scenes that he transcends the subject matter and gives it an almost surreal intensity, and the performances are strong enough to keep the film's nuttiness from capsizing it. Jessica Alba is suitably luscious and beguiling (her role gives new meaning to the term ""heartbreaker""), and Lena Olin and Terence Howard are both in fine form. As the unfortunate victim of anesthetic awareness, Hayden Christensen comes into his own as a performer (having mercifully managed to escape the Mark Hammil curse: that of being horribly miscast by George Lucas). Christensen has an unusually expressive face (the camera takes to him), and he can convey emotion without ever appearing to do much--fortunately, because the film hinges around his internal struggle, and on our feelings of empathy for him.Awake is a white-knuckle movie experience if ever there was one (it even carries a viewer warning), with some of the most sheerly visceral scenes of horror ever committed to celluloid. Watching someone undergoing open-heart surgery while fully conscious (and able to feel the incision) is enough to frazzle the nerves of the most hardened horror veterans, and this film is certainly not for the squeamish. Too bad the loopy plot (and the melodramatic character revelations, which are really just tired genre conventions) finally stretches our credibility to breaking point. As a result, Awake lacks a strong climax, and as a rollercoaster ride it doesn't have enough emotional depth to be fully satisfying (its shallowness is at odds with its rather contrived attempts at pathos). But for most of its length it's close to a pop classic, and probably the best metaphysical thriller since The Sixth Sense (a film I didn't much care for). In fact, Harold better watch out or he may wind up as the next M. Night Shyamalan. Awake has so many twists it makes you dizzy.",3,Preposterous Entertainment,1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,2921,"['Awake', 'new', 'thriller', 'first-time', 'director', 'Joby', 'Harold', 'grisly', 'real-life', 'phenomenon', 'called', 'anesthetic', 'awareness', 'when', 'patients', 'are', 'unaccountably', 'left', 'fully', 'conscious', 'physically', 'paralyzed', 'surgery', 'Harold', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'script', 'spun', 'preposterously', 'entertaining', 'yarn', 'grisly', 'germ', 'idea', 'hold', 'vice-like', 'grip', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'film', 'How', 'often', 'can', 'say', 'Hollywood', 'thriller', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'Awake', 'brazenly', 'indifferent', 'plausibility', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'admire', 'film', 'audacity', 'fantastic', 'plot', 'twists', 'Harold', 'Hitchcockian', 'flourishes', 'elements', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'mix', 'crazed', 'chef', 'lesser', 'hands', 'Awake', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'tawdry', 'melodrama', 'Harold', 'material', 'so', 'fervently', 'way', 'more', 'seasoned', 'professional', 'never', 'could', 'film', 'several', 'levels', 'once', 'Ingenious', 'not', 'mechanical', 'soul.Harold', 'brings', 'such', 'energy', 'focus', 'scenes', 'subject', 'matter', 'almost', 'surreal', 'intensity', 'performances', 'are', 'strong', 'enough', 'keep', 'film', 'nuttiness', 'capsizing', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'suitably', 'luscious', 'beguiling', 'role', 'new', 'meaning', 'term', 'heartbreaker', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'Terence', 'Howard', 'are', 'fine', 'form', 'unfortunate', 'victim', 'anesthetic', 'awareness', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'own', 'performer', 'having', 'mercifully', 'managed', 'escape', 'Mark', 'Hammil', 'curse', 'being', 'horribly', 'miscast', 'George', 'Lucas', 'Christensen', 'unusually', 'expressive', 'face', 'camera', 'can', 'convey', 'emotion', 'ever', 'appearing', 'do', 'much', 'fortunately', 'film', 'internal', 'struggle', 'feelings', 'empathy', 'him.Awake', 'white-knuckle', 'movie', 'experience', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'even', 'viewer', 'warning', 'most', 'sheerly', 'visceral', 'scenes', 'horror', 'ever', 'committed', 'celluloid', 'Watching', 'someone', 'undergoing', 'open-heart', 'surgery', 'fully', 'conscious', 'able', 'feel', 'incision', 'enough', 'frazzle', 'nerves', 'most', 'hardened', 'horror', 'veterans', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'squeamish', 'Too', 'bad', 'loopy', 'plot', 'melodramatic', 'character', 'revelations', 'are', 'really', 'just', 'tired', 'genre', 'conventions', 'finally', 'credibility', 'breaking', 'point', 'result', 'Awake', 'strong', 'climax', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'emotional', 'depth', 'be', 'fully', 'satisfying', 'shallowness', 'odds', 'rather', 'contrived', 'attempts', 'pathos', 'most', 'length', 'close', 'pop', 'classic', 'probably', 'best', 'metaphysical', 'thriller', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'fact', 'Harold', 'better', 'watch', 'may', 'wind', 'up', 'next', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'Awake', 'so', 'many', 'twists', 'dizzy']",N/A

1127024,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B0010X740A,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[3, 4]","I want to start things off by saying that from the viewpoint of someone who just had a surgery where the doctor's put you under for the procedure the phenomenon known as ""anesthetic awareness"", which served as the focal point for the recent release ""Awake"" was a somewhat disturbing concept that I didn't want to experience. Prior to my surgery (and it was a very minor one, mind you) I knew the movie ""Awake"" starring Hayden Christensen and Jessica Alba was being released on DVD, and I was wanting to see it; however, I had heard the critics say that this movie did for surgeries what ""Jaws"" did for swimming in the ocean. So, needless to say, I chose to wait until after the procedure to view this movie, but after I watched it I wished I would have just chosen a different movie to spend my time and money on.""Awake"" is the story of a rich tycoon named Clayton, (Hayden Christensen) who must undergo a heart transplant due to a heart condition. Not one for leaving possible unfinished business in his life behind should the surgery not be successful, Clayton decides to marry his girlfriend (Jessica Alba), attempt to make peace with his mother (Lena Olin), and get all his other affairs in order. While everything leading up to the surgery seems to be going off without a hitch, once in the operating room Clayton quickly discovers things are a disturbingly different story. After the anesthesia renders Clayton unconscious he soon realizes that his body is paralyzed, but his mind is very much awake, and fully aware of all that is occurring to his body during the procedure. As if the intensely horrible pain wasn't enough to contend with, Clayton begins to hear the doctor's discussing the very thing no patient ever wants to hear their wish to purposely cause the procedure to fail therefore killing the young man. As his time draws short, Clayton must desperately struggle to send out any kind of outward sign of his impending doom or all hope is lost.I had hoped that ""Awake"" would be a thoroughly engaging medical thriller that would live up to the promise that critic Frank Scheck of the Hollywood Reporter had made stating, ""Awake does for operations what Jaws did for the beach"", or that it would be ""completely absorbing"" as Roger Ebert had felt it was. However, to me it was a boring drama that I couldn't wait to finish and it would have had no redeeming factors whatsoever if not for a couple of clever plot twists that made the latter half of the film somewhat more bearable. For first time director and writer Joby Harold it was a nice try, and the subject matter was an intriguing choice, the cast was strong, and the dialogue was mostly well-written; but the execution of the material was less than stellar. Maybe the director's next effort, whatever that may be, will have better luck and pacing.The talented cast led by Hayden Christensen (""Star Wars - Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith""), Jessica Alba (""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer""), and Terrence Howard (""Four Brothers"") is very good for the most part, but their rather capable talents alone are not enough to keep this movie interesting to me. Out of the cast the only possible weak link was star Hayden Christensen, for the most part he did a very good job, but there were a few points where his dialogue seemed forced, although he made up for those moments with his voicing of his internal thoughts for the audience during the painful surgical procedure. Those moments were not only painful to watch, but also to hear his reactions as he tries in vain to fight through the pain and to think about anything other than what is happening to his body. Jessica Alba and Terrence Howard were very convincing as the caring new wife and the doctor who claims to be Clayton's friend, but hides the sinister secret of plotting his impending murder. But sometimes in movies a strong cast is not enough to overcome other weaknesses that can plague a film.The story features an interesting subject matter, as I've stated already, but it lacks any feeling of momentum to propel the story onward. For the first half of the movie, I was really bored and tempted to quit watching the movie altogether; then the major turning point in the plot occurs and the movie became a little more interesting. Even with the somewhat more enticing second half of the movie, the momentum still seemed a bit lacking and the mostly solid performances were not adequate in helping the story find its proper pacing. Perhaps some better editing choices could have helped the pacing of the story, or maybe some snappier dialogue earlier on, who knows, but something was sorely lacking in the story department.""Awake"" could have been a gripping thriller that would have left the audience on the edge of their seats, and made them leave the theater dreading hospital visits. However, the mostly strong performances on behalf of the actors, a decent story, and intriguing subject matter were not enough to overcome the incredibly slow pacing and dull points that filled the first half of the film and popped up once in a while in the latter half as well. So to me, any lasting effect the film could have had on me was lost due to boredom and an overall lack of interest in the outcome of the film.""Awake"" is rated R for disturbing images, language, and

I think this movie could have been much worse if the great casting didn't salvage the picture. The plot could have been executed better. Rather if they started with the surgery first then carry on from there... than vice versa. The ending just wasn't satisfying since the movie honestly didn't have much of a climax. It was sort of like watching Ghost... mixed in with parts of the 6th sense, and a lifetime drama movie. I honestly can't say anything about the acting... again the cast salvaged what was a horrible movie to begin with and made it watchable. The plot seemed way over the top like it didn't have much thought into it. You have Doctors, and Ceo's making moves and decissions that you know just aren't believable. A team of doctors swindeling a billionaire out of his money by a entricate insurance scam? or a ceo that can't seem to make a sound decission on his own life? Absolute trash of a plot. Not saying these couldn't have been interesting plots but the way they were executed and thought out just didn't seem likely. The movie comes and goes quickly and doesn't leave a lasting impression.

Sounds like a nightmare right?  Well its an actual phenomenon called anesthetic awareness.I must say I didn't really think this movie would be worth even a rent. I had to give it a try though since I'm always willing to try every movie regardless of critic reviews.First lets start off with the Blu Ray details:Picture 3.5/5 Pretty sharp picture, very little grainy-ness, or artifacts, blacks were solid, and whites were clean and bright.  The skin tones looked natural and very colorful.  Certainly not a Blu Ray to show your friends PQ but acceptable for watching this film.Sound 3.5/5 Sound is crisp, voices are very clear and loud.  Not much action or FX in this film but all the characters are easily heard, and the ambient noises are solid through rear surround.  I wasn't disappointed at all.Extras 3/5 I personally didn't get into the extra features much, just going by what I saw on the back of the case.  I usually check out the extras on my second or third viewing.  Seems like the ""basic"" extras included here.I don't usually do much for reviews on movies, because I don't wanna spoil anything for people that haven't gotten to enjoy the films for themselves yet.  I will say however, that this movie is definitely worth a look, Hayden and Jessica do a great job as a couple, and I actually felt his pain on the table in the OR.The movie is a bit slow, but not in a boring way.  It progresses through very well for the type of movie being shown.  I was never wondering if it was gonna get better, and as you meet the characters and get more of the story you get pulled in deeper!  (Terrence Howard is excellent in my opinion)This is a perfect weekend movie, if your bf/gf and you are sick of the normal horror, comedy, romantic comedy films.

They could have just left him asleep on the table and have him dream of the clues so he could actually wake up, knowing what happened.

Terrance Howard, Lena Olin and Jessica Alba seem to be only the ornament to the movie where only their presence (Not their talent) is needed to embelish it.  Story is supposed to address the issue of small group of people who during surgery under anestesia are fully aware of their surroundings and pain.  They are only paralized, but yet fully aware of everything and everyone around them.  Hayden Christiansen plays young 22 year old banker from rich family with a fatal heart problem.  When an opportunity arises for him to receive heart transplant, under anestisia that leaves him fully awake, he becomes aware that his doctor (Howard) and his new bride (Alba) have been planning all along to have him killed in order to get his money.  Conspiracy of such proportions is so hard to believe as is the possibility of 22 year old running company that controls the city.  As surgery certainly leads him to death, his possesive and controlling mother (this mother-son relationship seems very much incestious), decides to take destiny into her hands in order to save her beloved boy.  Story is poorly told as it is unbelievable and young actor Hayden needs to take more acting lessons. I taught that he was not so good in his ""Star Wars"" role where he was paired with Natalie Portman.  But not even hot actresses like Alba and Portman can make it up to his whiney acting.  Someone needs to tell this young man that his pretty face alone will not lead him to good roles.

Here someone undergoes surgery while still awake and learns who his friends really are and aren't.  Read the synopsis by Amazon as they did a very good and fair job.  I'm going to take the real lazy way out this time and just go to my hits and misses.Misses:1. Too slow at points.  There is a lot of exposition (with good reason), but it is still a lot of exposition.2. The acting is not consistent.  Some are terrific and others are flat.3. So many plot twists that one just can't give this film the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" that it needs.4. It moves from romance to health crisis, to scientific wonders, to absolute fantasy.  It attempts to cover too many genres.  That whole out of body sequence is clever, but just way out of place in this film.  It's likeBrian's SongmeetsWhat Dreams May Come.Hits:1. While not completely original (Sublimehad many elements here), it is in it's own way.  It is a very interesting film and it does have a few very good surprises.2. Jessica Alba is finally in a role that isn't so cutesy.  I thought she way quite convincing in her role.3. Hayden Christensen is better than usual, but that may not be too big of a compliment.4. Terrance Howard and Arliss Howard are always a pleasure to see, even if they are phoning in their performances for a quick paycheck.5.

I finally started reading more about it on the internet and it sounded too frightening and painful to be true. I was only wondering how a patient's anesthetic awareness could be detected if he or she were to have it prior to a surgery. Scary indeed!As my mind was focused on the medical condition I was hardly aware of the superb plot and that turned out to be quite a thriller. All leading stars have done a good job except that Hayden needs to do something about his acting and personality to avoid becoming monotonous and stale. The lovely and haunting piano signature tune was also a plus. The flaws were the openness of the heart transplant operation. I need to know which hospital in the U.S allows a relative to enter an operation theater so easily where a heart transplant procedure is being performed.

Quite an interesting premise that could have been so much more.It turns out to be a basic plot in which J. Alba and her crew..the 3 doc's...want to kill this young exec to get his money so they plan and carry out a botched heart transplant. The interesting twist was when the young execs mom kills herself at the hospital to give her son her heart and save him.Now, where the film could have been so much more is we are tantalized by the fact that this young exec is effected by a rare occurence in which the anethesia renders him paralyzed and unable to speak, but he is wide awake and can hear and feel everything. So, he obviously overhears the plot to have him killed.Movie ran about 1 hour 40 minutes. They could have injected an extra 20 minutes and altered the plot and it would have bee a 5 star flick. The above sounds great and has some great twists and starting plot....we then find out the plot is nothing more then killing him to get his money....only something we have seen in thousands of flicks.....with all of the above twists and the fact he was alive and awake and hearing about the ""Plot To Kill Him"" and the twist where they do kill him but mom calls in her special docs, kills herself and gives her son her heart and saves him.....with those two twists they could have rid the movie of 'we are killing him for his money' plot and give it some interesting ""Intrigue""..maybe having him killed for some secret corporate whatever..or any number of ""INTRIQUING"" plots other then 'we want his money'.Still a good flick to watch......but could have been an easy 5 stars had the writers not stalled after such good starts, premise and twists only to stall on the actual plot. Give me this film to edit, add a better 'plot' and 20 more minutes to do so and we have a possible award winner....because lets face it....the phenemona of being awake during surgery is very real and they did give a great twist when they had him dead...but then back alive with moms heart after hearing (and feeling!!) everything so it was a real winner until the movie was cut short with the dull and seen 25,000 times type plot/ending/conclusion.....Sorry for any typo's...I hate proof reading stuff like this as time is short and my fingers cant keep up with my brain so typos will happen ;>)",3,Interesting,1207267200,"04 4, 2008",2008,2362,"['Well', 'love', 'J.', 'Alba', 'so', 'just', 'watching', 'was', 'worth', 'film', 'interesting', 'premise', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more.It', 'out', 'be', 'basic', 'plot', 'J.', 'Alba', 'crew..the', '3', 'doc', 'want', 'kill', 'young', 'exec', 'get', 'money', 'plan', 'carry', 'out', 'botched', 'heart', 'transplant', 'interesting', 'twist', 'was', 'when', 'young', 'execs', 'mom', 'hospital', 'give', 'son', 'heart', 'save', 'him.Now', 'where', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'are', 'tantalized', 'fact', 'young', 'exec', 'effected', 'rare', 'occurence', 'anethesia', 'paralyzed', 'unable', 'speak', 'wide', 'awake', 'can', 'hear', 'feel', 'everything', 'So', 'obviously', 'plot', 'have', 'killed.Movie', 'ran', '1', 'hour', '40', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'injected', 'extra', '20', 'minutes', 'altered', 'plot', 'would', 'have', 'bee', '5', 'star', 'flick', 'above', 'great', 'great', 'twists', 'starting', 'plot', 'then', 'find', 'out', 'plot', 'nothing', 'more', 'then', 'killing', 'get', 'money', '.only', 'something', 'have', 'seen', 'thousands', 'flicks', '..with', 'above', 'twists', 'fact', 'was', 'alive', 'awake', 'hearing', 'Plot', 'Kill', 'Him', 'twist', 'where', 'do', 'kill', 'mom', 'special', 'docs', 'son', 'heart', '..with', 'two', 'twists', 'could', 'have', 'rid', 'movie', ""'we"", 'are', 'killing', 'money', 'plot', 'give', 'interesting', 'Intrigue', '..maybe', 'having', 'killed', 'secret', 'corporate', 'whatever..or', 'number', 'INTRIQUING', 'other', 'then', 'want', ""money'.Still"", 'good', 'flick', 'watch', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'easy', '5', 'stars', 'had', 'writers', 'not', 'stalled', 'such', 'good', 'starts', 'premise', 'only', 'stall', 'actual', 'plot', 'Give', 'film', 'edit', 'add', 'better', ""'plot"", '20', 'more', 'minutes', 'do', 'so', 'have', 'possible', 'award', 'winner', '.because', 'face', 'phenemona', 'being', 'awake', 'surgery', 'very', 'real', 'did', 'give', 'great', 'twist', 'when', 'had', 'dead', 'then', 'back', 'alive', 'moms', 'heart', 'hearing', 'feeling', 'everything', 'was', 'real', 'winner', 'movie', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'dull', 'seen', '25,000', 'times', 'type', 'plot/ending/conclusion', '..Sorry', 'typo', 'hate', 'proof', 'reading', 'stuff', 'time', 'short', 'fingers', 'cant', 'keep', 'up', 'brain', 'so', 'typos', 'will', 'happen']",N/A

Clay has a complex, expecting recognition from his mother Lilith Beresford that he is as capable as his father was, and he needs heart transplantation. When Clay finds a donor compatible with his rare blood, he requests his friend Dr. Jack Harper operate him under the protest of his mother that wants the famous Dr. Jonathan Neyer responsible for the procedure. On the eve of his heart surgery, Clay marries Sam and during the surgery, he experiences an ""anesthetic awareness"" that leaves his conscious but paralyzed. Clay witnesses the dialogs in the room and discovers dark secrets about his surgery. This movie is short and yet still does a pretty good job developing the characters. There are several twists and turns in this movie and some easy to see coming, others surprising, and some not necessary. But you should appreciate the attempt whether or not you saw it coming. Terrence Howard is always good, Jessica Alba actually turns in a very decent performance, and Hayden Christensen is Annakin Skywalker as a billionaire. Go into this with an open mind and not trying to figure out every little twist and turn, and you,ve got yourself a very nice little thriller on your hands.

And as good as a Star Wars actor can be in, well, Star Wars. So the only reason i bought this movie was because Hayden wouldnt do a terrible movie.Maybe the script read better than the final product turned out to be. I will spoil the movie.Here goes. The idea of open heart transplant surgery and being awake but unable to do anything about it is cool. I thought that part was totally gruesome-awesome. After that, movie does a sharp nosedive south.They decided to make this whole lame whodunnit mystery that he kinda starts to hear about while hes being operated on. Couple that with this idiotic sequence where he has an out of body experience and starts going everywhere and seeing everything in other rooms going on around him. Ludicrous. Just painfully absurd. He finds out he was conned by his new bride. Blah. And its all something really trite and stupid about a hospital staff needing money to pay off malpractice settlements.Read that last line again. The whole movie's conflict is about PAYING OFF MALPRACTICE SETTLEMENTS. Like that corny game operation. What the hell were they thinking????You say to yourself ""this movie cant get any dumber from here on"". But it does. His mom just spur of the moment calls an expert surgeon and tells him shes gonna OD on pills in the cafeteria so her son, who is about to die, can live. Nevermind the ethics or realism here. Then his mom has an out of body experience (i know i know. what is going on) and they decide to throw in another really stupid and TOTALLY IRRELEVANT twist about how his mom killed his dad when he was young. At this point, nobody cares anyway.What should have happened, is Hayden Christenson should have stayed in his body and brutally experienced open heart transplant surgery while conscious and immobile. Bam. that should have been the movie right there. That was the most entertaining portion of it. Maybe throw in some post traumatic stress and gory flashbacks or something, i dunno.The only other good part of the movie was Jessica  Alba in a tight white tanktop that goes totally transparent when hayden pulls her in the bathrub.

I normally am never able to figure out endings or plot twists, but I surprised myself by easily figuring out the major twist after five minutes into the film. There is a common movie rule of focusing on something that seems irrelevant at the time, to bring it back in the end to surprise you. Here, however, I felt it was so obvious the filmmakers almost want you to figure it out. I started hoping I was wrong, that there would be some unexpected ""shocks and twists"", but alas I was not.Hayden Christensen plays Clay Beresford the son of a billionaire widow (played by Lena Olin). He has a weak heart and has been on the transplant donors list for a year. He is also secretly engaged to his mother's house assistant, Sam Lockwood (played by Jessica Alba). The night he gets married to her he also gets the donors call. From this point everything starts going wrong, starting with Clay waking up from an overdose of anesthetic, but being paralyzed to move or say anything. This is apparently something that happens to one in every seven hundred surgeries a year. Well while awake he feels all the pain of his chest being sawed open and also hears the doctors discussing their plan to kill him. From then on it is a thriller that has a moderate intensity, but you find out things rather quickly and early despite it coming to a swift conclusion.All the performances were good, Lena Olin giving an excellent performance. It was entertaining, and until I found out that I was correct in my speculations of the end, it held my attention.

1127064,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0010X740A,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","""Awake"" is a thriller that opens with an intriguing setup. A young billionaire Clay Beresford (Hayden Christensen) has a heart transplant, but during the surgery - performed by Dr. Jack Harper (Terrence Howard), who once saved Clay's life and now his friend - Clay realizes that something is not quite right with the operation.First, Clay is under general anesthesia and is supposed to be unconscious, but he remains ""awake,"" can hear the conversations of the operating room staff. Moreover, while he is on the operating table, totally paralyzed, he ""overhears"" some conversation going on, and notices the disturbing nature of it.Even if you are not an expert of heart surgery, you will think the rest of the film's story is nothing short of implausible in the medical or legal point of view, but ""Awake,"" written and directed by Joby Harold (his debut), is certainly unpredictable. With the careful (though a little dull) setup of the back stories, a constant flow of events to provide suspense, and solid acting from the capable supports, the thriller is an enjoyable ride, as long as you are wiling to accept the barely covered plot holes.Besides Hayden Christensen and Terrence Howard, ""Awake"" stars Jessica Alba, Georgina Chapman, Arliss Howard, Christopher McDonald, Lena Olin and Fisher Stevens. Christensen and Alba as Clay's girlfriend Sam are both good, but Arliss Howard and Christopher McDonald steal the show, though their roles are not very big. It is not surprisingly Terrence Howard who gives a touch of drama to his otherwise bland character.Overall ""Awake"" is a fairly competent thriller, but be warned.

The plot is unique and twisted and the actors were all very good.  However, the script left too many unanswered questions.  The idea of a drunken anesthesiologist (last minute stand in not involved in the murder plot) not properly anesthetizing a patient so the patient feels pain is scary as hell. My eyes were closed at the first cut as I couldn't watch.  He is so drunk, he doesn't even see his patient is awake and crying. Diabolical is the only word to describe the wife, best friend surgeon and other operating room staff involved in murdering a man undergoing a heart transplant.  The ending was both satisfying (they got theirs) and sad.  The love between mother and son was tremendous.That said, the movie script left many unanswered questions.1) Was the anesthesiologist ever caught for being drunk on duty?  Although he helped police locate the villains inside the hospital, he still tortured a patient.2) As Clay is laying on an operating table with no heart inside his chest and a bypass machine pumping his blood, anesthesiologist Dr Lupin asked Clay's mother for permission to stop life support.  Clay was married to Samantha so legally wouldn't his wife make the decision to turn off life support?  Since Sam wanted Clay dead, she would have agreed--end of movie script.  The mother could only have filed court papers to stop Samantha but that would have taken more time than Clay had.3) When was life support actually turned off and how long can someone live without a heart and did the script push this time-line too far?  Two people Dr Harper (Clay's surgeon friend) and anesthesiologist Dr Lupin tell Lilith her son didn't make it.  Dr Harper then goes back to the operating room where viewers can clearly hear the whirring life support machines and says ""its done"".  He never got permission to stop life support because he never asked.  The anesthesiologist Dr. Lupin stays with mom Lilith and asks her permission to turn off the bypass machine which Lilith never agrees to.  Dr Lupin says he will wait in the hallway (for her decision) and Lilith goes to the cafeteria.  Dr Lupin sees this and waits a bit and approaches her again and she is dead.  The movie never shows Dr Lupin going back to the operating room so the bypass machines should not have been turned off.  Yet, when Dr Jonathon Neyer, the good cardiologist surgeon, gets to the operating room to perform a 2nd heart transplant from mother to son, the heart/lung machine noises are NOT heard. The patients face is covered.  It took awhile for the mother to figure out the scheme/take pills/die and for Dr Neyer to arrive.  How long can a patient live without a heart and did the movie script push it?4) Was Clay's mother's heart even salvageable?  Clay suffered from a heart disorder (currently) and asthma (as a child).  I did not recognize the names of the medication Samantha reeled off to Lilith when the bottles fell out of her purse onto the hospital floor but if Clay's mother overdosed on Clay's heart medication, wouldn't that make her heart contaminated?  If she overdosed on asthma medication, would this make her heart unusable?5) To avoid any contamination wouldn't it be more logical for the script to have Lilith slit her wrists in a closet or something rather than take a bunch of pills out in an open cafeteria where she could have been seen and her heart possibly contaminated?  Lilith called Dr Nayer and told him of the murder plot and to use her heart for her son.
