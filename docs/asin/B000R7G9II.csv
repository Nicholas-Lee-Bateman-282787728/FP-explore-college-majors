1079445,A1CH1X5JZL6TBC,B000R7G9II,GoodTimberLane,"[17, 18]","I have read the book & also seen the movie.  Although the two are quite different from each other, they are both good in their own right.I purchased the movie that was an import, ""All zone PAL"" meaning you can watch it on your computer not on your DVD player (if you live in the USA).  It was uncut & unrated (126 minutes)Thai DVD - Language spoken in Duetch/Thai & Subtitles are in English/Thai.This is the only version that I know of that has English subtitles.It is very hard to explain for myself the feelings that watching this movie evoked in me because they are polar opposite -On one hand you have a woman that doesn't really know this man, his background, his culture ... I mean n-o-t-h-i-n-g (it's pretty much a relationship based on physical attraction). She ends up finding this man & jumping head first into a world that is extremely hard & on certain levels shocking!  She lives where there is no running water, no electricity, a few cars in the whole area, where female circumcision is the way for a child to becoming a woman, as well as giving your first born to your husbands mother. Not to forget that your home is a hut constructed with dried cow dung.  This life style is hard on the native Masai people let alone someone from a completely different background... but ...it is this woman's same determination that makes you stand up & applaud her courage for adjusting & living in a way that most people would have given up in the first week or died trying.How many people do you know(family, friends, etc.) that have jumped into a relationship with someone based on a physical attraction??  I personally can count more than a few ... They go into a relationship based on looks & learn about ""who"" the person is later on.  People are people where ever you are in this world - we all have the same feelings regardless of our background, nationality, culture, and skin color.  When you take 2 people from such extremely different backgrounds & throw in barely knowing each others language - you take an already hard situation & make it even more difficult.It is a beautiful movie with a sad story for not only Carola but also for the Samburu warrior Lemalian.If your looking for a movie that is different, unique & based on a true story - This one may interest you.  A few words of caution with this DVD:  Some of the content is graphic (a few scenes with sexual situations & nudity, a still birth, & a scene where a young girl (approx 12-14 year old) is going to be circumcised.  For myself personally ... I wish there was an edited version - it was too graphic for me (this was the only copy I found to have English subtitles & wasn't aware of how graphic is was. This was my opinion - yours may be different.Hopefully this can help anyone who is contemplating whether or not to get this movie.  I would strongly suggest reading the book first (it is very simply put together & easy to read) it will give you soooo much more depth to the characters & there lives.",4,Die Weisse Massai - The White Masai,1235347200,"02 23, 2009",2009,2983,"['have', 'read', 'book', 'also', 'seen', 'movie', 'two', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'other', 'are', 'good', 'own', 'right.I', 'purchased', 'movie', 'was', 'import', 'zone', 'PAL', 'meaning', 'can', 'watch', 'computer', 'not', 'DVD', 'player', 'live', 'USA', 'was', 'uncut', 'unrated', '126', 'minutes', 'Thai', 'DVD', 'Language', 'spoken', 'Duetch/Thai', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'English/Thai.This', 'only', 'version', 'know', 'English', 'subtitles.It', 'very', 'hard', 'explain', 'feelings', 'watching', 'movie', 'evoked', 'are', 'polar', 'opposite', '-On', 'one', 'hand', 'have', 'woman', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'man', 'background', 'culture', 'mean', 'n-o-t-h-i-n-g', 'pretty', 'much', 'relationship', 'based', 'physical', 'attraction', 'up', 'finding', 'man', 'jumping', 'head', 'first', 'world', 'extremely', 'hard', 'certain', 'levels', 'shocking', 'where', 'running', 'water', 'electricity', 'few', 'cars', 'whole', 'area', 'where', 'female', 'circumcision', 'way', 'child', 'becoming', 'woman', 'as', 'well', 'giving', 'first', 'born', 'husbands', 'mother', 'Not', 'forget', 'home', 'hut', 'constructed', 'dried', 'cow', 'dung', 'life', 'style', 'hard', 'native', 'Masai', 'people', 'let', 'alone', 'someone', 'completely', 'different', 'background', 'woman', 'same', 'determination', 'stand', 'up', 'courage', 'adjusting', 'living', 'way', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'first', 'week', 'died', 'trying.How', 'many', 'people', 'do', 'know', 'family', 'friends', 'etc', 'have', 'jumped', 'relationship', 'someone', 'based', 'physical', 'attraction', 'personally', 'can', 'count', 'more', 'few', 'go', 'relationship', 'based', 'looks', 'learn', 'who', 'person', 'later', 'People', 'are', 'people', 'where', 'ever', 'are', 'world', 'have', 'same', 'feelings', 'regardless', 'background', 'nationality', 'culture', 'skin', 'color', 'When', 'take', '2', 'people', 'such', 'extremely', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'throw', 'barely', 'knowing', 'others', 'language', 'take', 'already', 'hard', 'situation', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'difficult.It', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'sad', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'Carola', 'also', 'Samburu', 'warrior', 'Lemalian.If', 'looking', 'movie', 'different', 'unique', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'one', 'may', 'interest', 'few', 'words', 'caution', 'DVD', 'content', 'graphic', 'few', 'scenes', 'sexual', 'situations', 'nudity', 'still', 'birth', 'scene', 'where', 'young', 'girl', '12-14', 'year', 'old', 'going', 'be', 'circumcised', 'personally', 'wish', 'was', 'edited', 'version', 'was', 'too', 'graphic', 'was', 'only', 'copy', 'found', 'have', 'English', 'subtitles', 'was', ""n't"", 'aware', 'how', 'graphic', 'was', 'was', 'opinion', 'yours', 'may', 'be', 'different.Hopefully', 'can', 'help', 'anyone', 'who', 'contemplating', 'not', 'get', 'movie', 'would', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'reading', 'book', 'first', 'very', 'simply', 'put', 'together', 'easy', 'read', 'will', 'give', 'soooo', 'much', 'more', 'depth', 'characters']",The Weisse Massai
1079446,A28V8XJMS2T89Z,B000R7G9II,Marilyn Parker,"[1, 2]","I discovered this movie on Hulu and have watched it at least 10 times.I did think it was sort of silly for Carola to travel after a man she had only briefly met. I can understand about instant physical attraction, but in my opion she was not very wise and should have taken time to get to know him....I also felt, Lemallian was slightly off in his mind..maybe a bit mentally defecient.. I lived through a situation somewhat similiar..a man i knew seemed fine..then he started throwing tantrums like a child..I very well understand how Carola felt.Anyway..all in all it is a romantic story and something about it that catches the watcher's interest..Maybe it is the theme is what all women seek....a love that trancends all time and space.. I think that women these days still want the forever after type of love, and it does not exist anymore....or rarely does exist..maybe 1 out of 1000 women find that one in a million man who is romantic,caring and faithful.Some parts of the movie were very sad, but most of the hardships that the book describes are left out of this movie..like the mosquitos....she got malaria over and over..not just one time...and when she finally left Africa she was in very poor health. I was horrified at the circumcism thing! Women get so little pleasure from sex mostly..then to take away the part that might help them to enjoy it..is very cruel....I assume the women just endure it..get pregnant and that is all there is to being married. Lots of women in The USA live that sort of life as to just enduring it and never even knowing what a climax is cause: men think all women want sex,all women have instant climaxes,that all they need to do is shove it in and she will be satisfied with that. Then men wonder why after years of enduring what anyone else would call rape...she cannot endure it no more. Most women will not report rape by a spouse cause if she does not have a fancy job..where is she going to go, or how is she going to support her children...So many women are trapped in years and years of all kinds of abuse. And if she does report it..who do Police..Courts beleive..of course The Men...I would strongly recommend this for anyone to watch and it does help if one reads the books to fill in the missing parts....I did think The Actress who played Carola did not do a very good job...That was a big flaw in the movie. She was more a K. Stewart type and i could see her playing that role with never any emotions and sort of a dead pan acting style.",5,AWESOME!,1366848000,"04 25, 2013",2013,2494,"['discovered', 'movie', 'Hulu', 'have', 'watched', 'least', '10', 'times.I', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'sort', 'silly', 'Carola', 'travel', 'man', 'had', 'only', 'briefly', 'met', 'can', 'understand', 'instant', 'physical', 'attraction', 'opion', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'wise', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'time', 'get', 'know', '.I', 'also', 'felt', 'Lemallian', 'was', 'slightly', 'off', 'mind..maybe', 'bit', 'mentally', 'defecient..', 'lived', 'situation', 'somewhat', 'similiar..a', 'man', 'knew', 'seemed', 'fine..then', 'started', 'throwing', 'tantrums', 'child..I', 'very', 'well', 'understand', 'how', 'Carola', 'felt.Anyway..all', 'romantic', 'story', 'something', 'watcher', 'interest..Maybe', 'theme', 'what', 'women', 'seek', '.a', 'love', 'time', 'space..', 'think', 'women', 'days', 'still', 'want', 'forever', 'type', 'love', 'not', 'exist', 'anymore', '.or', 'rarely', 'exist..maybe', '1', '1000', 'women', 'find', 'one', 'million', 'man', 'who', 'romantic', 'caring', 'faithful.Some', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', 'very', 'sad', 'most', 'hardships', 'book', 'describes', 'are', 'left', 'mosquitos', '.she', 'got', 'malaria', 'over..not', 'just', 'one', 'time', 'when', 'finally', 'left', 'Africa', 'was', 'very', 'poor', 'health', 'was', 'horrified', 'circumcism', 'thing', 'Women', 'get', 'so', 'little', 'pleasure', 'sex', 'mostly..then', 'take', 'away', 'part', 'might', 'help', 'enjoy', 'it..is', 'very', 'cruel', '.I', 'assume', 'women', 'just', 'endure', 'it..get', 'pregnant', 'being', 'married', 'Lots', 'women', 'USA', 'live', 'sort', 'life', 'just', 'enduring', 'never', 'even', 'knowing', 'what', 'climax', 'cause', 'men', 'think', 'women', 'want', 'sex', 'women', 'have', 'instant', 'climaxes', 'need', 'do', 'shove', 'will', 'be', 'satisfied', 'Then', 'men', 'wonder', 'why', 'years', 'enduring', 'what', 'anyone', 'else', 'would', 'call', 'rape', 'can', 'not', 'endure', 'more', 'Most', 'women', 'will', 'not', 'report', 'rape', 'spouse', 'cause', 'not', 'have', 'fancy', 'job..where', 'going', 'go', 'how', 'going', 'support', 'children', 'So', 'many', 'women', 'are', 'trapped', 'years', 'years', 'kinds', 'abuse', 'report', 'it..who', 'do', 'Police..Courts', 'beleive..of', 'course', 'Men', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'watch', 'help', 'one', 'books', 'fill', 'missing', 'parts', '.I', 'did', 'think', 'Actress', 'who', 'played', 'Carola', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'was', 'big', 'flaw', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'K.', 'Stewart', 'type', 'i', 'could', 'see', 'playing', 'role', 'never', 'emotions', 'sort', 'dead', 'pan', 'acting', 'style']",The Weisse Massai

1079448,AU4X9XZLS5LI5,B000R7G9II,P. Oski,"[14, 18]","Four stars is a bit much for this, but it's not bad. I was never bored, but if this had not been based on a real story, I would have knocked stars off for presenting an implausibly stupid heroine and generally shallow characters.The Swiss woman who gives up her business, boyfriend, family and country because she gets the hots for a young Masai warrior while on vacation is shallow. She can't be portrayed as anything else. The Masai women and a world-weary Italian priest are the only characters who appear to have any sense at all. They're a welcome respite from the generally idiotic cast of characters who inhabit the Kenya and Switzerland of this biographical melodrama.The acting is good and the locales impressive. There is no plot to speak of other than what I've mentioned, just a collection of episodes. Some are gruelling, others vaguely humorous or touching. Since the two main protagonists are incapable of empathy or learning, the portrayal of their life as a series of isolated events in haphazard sequence is oddly fitting.There's some steamy sex, a pregnancy gone horrifically wrong and an offscreen ritualistic genital mutilation. We don't learn much about the Masai, but we see the arrogance of Western self-indulgence and the ""Noble Savage"" version of colonial racism in the objectification of the hapless Masai by the predatory hedonism of his Swiss lover. I suppose we are meant to admire her pluck, but it's over shadowed by her cluelessness.",4,Portrait of  the Idiot as a Young Woman,1189036800,"09 6, 2007",2007,1466,"['Four', 'stars', 'bit', 'much', 'not', 'bad', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'based', 'real', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'knocked', 'stars', 'presenting', 'implausibly', 'stupid', 'heroine', 'generally', 'shallow', 'characters.The', 'Swiss', 'woman', 'who', 'up', 'business', 'boyfriend', 'family', 'country', 'hots', 'young', 'Masai', 'warrior', 'vacation', 'shallow', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'portrayed', 'anything', 'else', 'Masai', 'women', 'world-weary', 'Italian', 'priest', 'are', 'only', 'characters', 'who', 'appear', 'have', 'sense', ""'re"", 'welcome', 'respite', 'generally', 'idiotic', 'cast', 'characters', 'who', 'inhabit', 'Kenya', 'Switzerland', 'biographical', 'melodrama.The', 'acting', 'good', 'locales', 'impressive', 'plot', 'speak', 'other', 'what', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'just', 'collection', 'episodes', 'are', 'gruelling', 'others', 'vaguely', 'humorous', 'touching', 'two', 'main', 'protagonists', 'are', 'incapable', 'empathy', 'learning', 'portrayal', 'life', 'series', 'isolated', 'events', 'haphazard', 'sequence', 'oddly', 'steamy', 'sex', 'pregnancy', 'gone', 'horrifically', 'wrong', 'offscreen', 'ritualistic', 'genital', 'mutilation', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'much', 'Masai', 'see', 'arrogance', 'Western', 'self-indulgence', 'Noble', 'Savage', 'version', 'colonial', 'racism', 'objectification', 'hapless', 'Masai', 'predatory', 'hedonism', 'Swiss', 'lover', 'suppose', 'are', 'meant', 'admire', 'pluck', 'shadowed', 'cluelessness']",The Weisse Massai
