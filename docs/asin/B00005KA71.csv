661340,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00005KA71,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[12, 12]","Bob Marley is a giant in the world of music. He and his band, the Wailers, helped to introduce a new style of music to the world. His lyrics spoke volumes about what he experienced in his native land of Jamaica and his short life was mired by controversy. This documentary explores the late reggae singer's tenure on this planet, with lots of interviews and plenty of music.Marley's life is laid out before the screen on this documentary with many of his friends, family, and associates speaking to the camera about the reggae legend. Former Wailers Bunny Livingstone and Peter Tosh talk about Bob Marley as a musician and friend. Chris Blackwell from Island Records, shares his feelings on Marley.  Rita Marley, Bob's widow, talks more than anyone else and she provides some insight into Marley's personal life and family relations. It is known that Bob Marley had affairs with many different women and Rita talks about this on the documentary. She seems to have accepted husband Bob's infidelity- both then and now- even though she was obviously a little uneasy with the situation.Marley himself speaks a few times in this documentary, but he only says a few words and what he says is often difficult to understand. His Jamaican accent is heavy and you have to listen close to decipher his words. When he sings, the words are easier to understand. It was nice to hear Marley speak, but he really doesn't get a chance to say much. As soon as he starts to answer a question, the camera switches to a different scene. This was a little frustrating. I would have liked to hear more words of wisdom directly from the man himself. I also would have liked to hear some comments from Marley's children, like Ziggy and the others. This would have added some more insight into Bob Marley's character.Musical clips can be seen throughout this documentary. Some of the featured songs are well- known tunes, but there are some rarities too. And as an added feature on the DVD, you get a selection of musical tunes to listen to along with a discography of Marley's albums, including those issued after his death.Bob Marley is a larger than life figure in his native land of Jamaica and he is a musical icon to many people around the world who gained inspiration from his music. This documentary has a few flaws, but it is still a very good one for fans of the late reggae singer. It includes plenty of interviews, rare photos, and lots of great reggae tunes from this musical genius.",4,The Birth of Reggae and a Music Legend,1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,2471,"['Bob', 'Marley', 'giant', 'world', 'music', 'band', 'Wailers', 'helped', 'introduce', 'new', 'style', 'music', 'world', 'lyrics', 'spoke', 'volumes', 'what', 'experienced', 'native', 'land', 'Jamaica', 'short', 'life', 'was', 'mired', 'controversy', 'documentary', 'late', 'reggae', 'singer', 'tenure', 'planet', 'lots', 'interviews', 'plenty', 'music.Marley', 'life', 'laid', 'out', 'screen', 'documentary', 'many', 'friends', 'family', 'speaking', 'camera', 'reggae', 'legend', 'Former', 'Wailers', 'Bunny', 'Livingstone', 'Peter', 'Tosh', 'talk', 'Bob', 'Marley', 'musician', 'friend', 'Chris', 'Blackwell', 'Island', 'Records', 'shares', 'feelings', 'Marley', 'Rita', 'Marley', 'Bob', 'widow', 'more', 'anyone', 'else', 'insight', 'Marley', 'personal', 'life', 'family', 'relations', 'known', 'Bob', 'Marley', 'had', 'affairs', 'many', 'different', 'women', 'Rita', 'talks', 'documentary', 'have', 'accepted', 'husband', 'Bob', 'infidelity-', 'then', 'now-', 'even', 'was', 'obviously', 'little', 'uneasy', 'situation.Marley', 'few', 'times', 'documentary', 'only', 'few', 'words', 'what', 'often', 'difficult', 'understand', 'Jamaican', 'accent', 'heavy', 'have', 'listen', 'close', 'decipher', 'words', 'When', 'words', 'are', 'easier', 'understand', 'was', 'nice', 'hear', 'Marley', 'speak', 'really', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'say', 'much', 'As', 'soon', 'answer', 'question', 'camera', 'different', 'scene', 'was', 'little', 'frustrating', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'hear', 'more', 'words', 'wisdom', 'directly', 'man', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'hear', 'comments', 'Marley', 'children', 'Ziggy', 'others', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'more', 'insight', 'Bob', 'Marley', 'character.Musical', 'clips', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'documentary', 'featured', 'songs', 'are', 'well-', 'known', 'tunes', 'are', 'rarities', 'too', 'added', 'feature', 'DVD', 'get', 'selection', 'musical', 'tunes', 'listen', 'along', 'discography', 'Marley', 'albums', 'including', 'issued', 'death.Bob', 'Marley', 'larger', 'life', 'figure', 'native', 'land', 'Jamaica', 'musical', 'icon', 'many', 'people', 'world', 'who', 'gained', 'inspiration', 'music', 'documentary', 'few', 'flaws', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'fans', 'late', 'reggae', 'singer', 'plenty', 'interviews', 'rare', 'photos', 'lots', 'great', 'reggae', 'tunes', 'musical', 'genius']",Rebel Music - The Bob Marley Story

He then knew what it was he wanted to do with his life,and upon his return to his native Jamaica, he hooked up with a band of rag tagsfrom around trenchtown and surrounding Kingston and a band was born!Influenced by the local sounds of ""ska"" music and the folk-like primitive rhythmsof the island chants, as well as a new spiritual awakening through the outcastrastafari religion and philosophy, all the elements began to come together!With plenty of practice and trial and error, The Wailers first, and later,Bob Marley & The Wailers emerged on the world music scene in the early 70'swith a new, urgent, passionate sound with a different beat and profound messagecalled ""Reggae"" and the rest is history!This documentary goes on to cover Bob Marley's incredible story in intimate detailwith interviews from Bob's mother Cecilia, his first and principle wife, Rita Marley,members of the Wailers including early recorded interviews with the late great Peter Tosh,Island Records founder Chris Blackwell, and many more who freely recant their stories.There is also great concert footage as well as interviews with Bob Marley andhome video footage of his homelife and lighter moments.His darker moments: the assassination attempt, his cancer diagnosis in 1978,and his eventual decline in health, subsequent death in May of 1981,and funeral are all covered as well within the context of this film.This is defintely a worthwhile purchase for fans of Bob Marley's music and legend.",5,A Very Good Chronicle Of The Life & Transcendant Spirit / Music Of The Legendary Bob Marley!!,1257811200,"11 10, 2009",2009,2832,"['first', 'saw', 'documentary', 'back', '2003', 'Sundance', 'channel', 'then', '2005', 'VH-1', 'enjoyed', 'times', 'wayback', 'beginnings', 'legendary', 'Bob', 'Marley', 'life', 'ruraloutlying', 'countryside', 'Kingston', 'Jamaica', 'born', 'product', 'white', 'britishfather', 'black', 'mother', 'who', 'worked', 'domestic', 'cook', '1945.It', 'covers', 'growing', 'up', 'humble', 'circumstances', 'making', 'best', 'what', 'heand', 'mother', 'had', 'finding', 'laughter', 'wisdom', 'pride', 'pain', 'andharsh', 'realities', 'growing', 'up', 'dire', 'poverty.His', 'father', 'disappeared', 'life', 'early', 'so', 'never', 'was', 'really', 'influence.By', 'teen', 'years', 'had', 'relocated', 'Kingston', 'concrete', 'jungle', 'called', 'Trenchtown', '.There', 'became', 'rude', 'boy', 'awhile', 'never', 'really', 'stuck', 'thug', 'lifewas', ""n't"", 'high-spirited', 'good-natured', 'serious-minded', 'young', 'Bob', 'who', 'had', 'began', 'totake', 'liking', 'music', 'playing', 'guitar.He', 'left', 'Jamaica', 'few', 'times', 'years', 'lived', 'work', 'menial', 'jobs', 'northeastern', 'southeastern', 'U.S.', 'was', 'then', 'throws', 'thecivil', 'rights', 'struggle', 'social', 'upheaval', ""1960's.This"", 'accompanied', 'music', 'artists', 'Curtis', 'Mayfield', 'Impressions', 'Motown', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'messages', 'music', 'times', 'spoke', 'soul', 'andinspired', 'end', 'then', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'wanted', 'do', 'life', 'return', 'native', 'Jamaica', 'hooked', 'up', 'band', 'rag', 'tagsfrom', 'trenchtown', 'surrounding', 'Kingston', 'band', 'was', 'born', 'Influenced', 'local', 'sounds', 'ska', 'music', 'folk-like', 'primitive', 'rhythmsof', 'island', 'chants', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'spiritual', 'awakening', 'outcastrastafari', 'religion', 'philosophy', 'elements', 'began', 'come', 'together', 'plenty', 'practice', 'trial', 'error', 'Wailers', 'first', 'later', 'Bob', 'Marley', 'Wailers', 'emerged', 'world', 'music', 'scene', 'early', ""70'swith"", 'new', 'urgent', 'passionate', 'sound', 'different', 'beat', 'profound', 'messagecalled', 'Reggae', 'rest', 'history', 'documentary', 'cover', 'Bob', 'Marley', 'incredible', 'story', 'intimate', 'detailwith', 'interviews', 'Bob', 'mother', 'Cecilia', 'first', 'principle', 'wife', 'Rita', 'Marley', 'members', 'Wailers', 'including', 'early', 'recorded', 'interviews', 'late', 'great', 'Peter', 'Tosh', 'Island', 'Records', 'founder', 'Chris', 'Blackwell', 'many', 'more', 'who', 'freely', 'recant', 'stories.There', 'also', 'great', 'concert', 'footage', 'as', 'well', 'interviews', 'Bob', 'Marley', 'andhome', 'video', 'footage', 'homelife', 'lighter', 'moments.His', 'darker', 'moments', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'cancer', 'diagnosis', '1978', 'eventual', 'decline', 'health', 'subsequent', 'death', 'May', '1981', 'funeral', 'are', 'covered', 'well', 'context', 'film.This', 'defintely', 'worthwhile', 'purchase', 'fans', 'Bob', 'Marley', 'music', 'legend']",Rebel Music - The Bob Marley Story

661344,A2ECPW4RA7NWMP,B00005KA71,John Sollami,"[5, 5]","Bob Marley is still greatly missed. He died in 1981 at the age of 36 from melanoma. He had reached international fame and had arguably produced some of the most inspirational and original music of the century. At the height of his power he apparently couldn't imagine himself being sick and sadly did nothing about his melanoma for three years until it caught up with him. This DVD is a fine documentary about a great artist whose music lives on from generation to generation. My son, who is 11, loves Bob Marley, as do all of his friends. The documentary would have been better if it contained more performance footage of complete songs instead of relatively quick cuts as it moves on to more historical material.
