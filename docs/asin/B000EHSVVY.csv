Harvey ""Cricket ,country music and a go...","[0, 0]","Delmer Daves made some great Westerns in the 'fifties of which the best known are probably Broken Arrow and the recently revamped 3.10 To Yuma .However for my money the BEST is the movie under consideration here,The Last Wagon .Were it not for a slightly anti-climactic and tacked on moralistic  ending it would be flawless.The opening crane shots alone are proof positive that we are in the hands of a cinematic genius -they are among the very best in cinema regardless of genre.Shot in a rugged part of Arizona the movie opens on a chase sequence as Comanche Todd (Widmark)is being pursued across inhospitable terrain by a trio of lawmen .They are hunting him down for murder -he killed their brothers .It emerges that he had strong motives for so doing -they killed his wife and two sons .Captured after a gruelling chase he is taken by his surviving tracker to join up with a small wagon train .Chained to a wheel his treatment by his captor is unrelentingly harsh but he does win a measure of support from some train members.The train is attacked and virtually wiped out by Apaches and Todd along with a handful of others survivesHe agrees to endeavour to lead the survivors to safety across hostile territory and handicapped by shortages of water ,food and ammunition.the party is also less than unanimous in the way it views Todd .Billy (Tommy Rettig)is an admirer -a teenager he comes to view Todd as a surrogate father .The women of the party are a mixed race woman Jolie (Susan Kohler)who is roundly abused by her snobbish and racist half sister Valinda(Stephanie Griffith).The other woman present is Jenny (Felicia Farr)who forms a strong emotional bond with Todd .The men are the hostile and belicose Ridge (Nick Adams)and the calmer Clint (Ray Stricklin)It is a fraught journey with numerous encounters with Apaches and the odd snake not to mention a final brush with the cavalryThis is a very physical movie-Todd endures the kind of physical working over that befell James Stewart in the Anthony Mann pictures from the same era-at one point he is even crucified on a wheel .There is a genuine sense of hardsshsip conveyed here .The journey is not simply to physical survival -it is journey which sees many of the characters revising their world view and growing as people as a result of their ordeal.It

973750,A1BATHNY2QAZI2,B000EHSVVY,"Jaime Contreras ""donjaime""","[0, 0]","I enjoy westerns that are social commentaries, provocative and multi-layered. The Last Wagon fulfills those requirements and is beautifully acted and filmed by Delmer Daves. Richard Widmark effortlessly plays Jonathan &#8216;Comanche&#8221; Todd, a white man raised by Indians and a wanted killer three brothers. The film opens with Todd attempting to escape the brutal Sheriff Bull Harper,played by George Matthews (the craggy-faced and heavy-jowled character actor of the 1950s and early-1960s.  Captured, Todd and Harper join up a Tuscon-bound wagon train of Christians led by Gen. Howard (Carl Benton Reid) as it prepares to enter the dangerous Apache territory, valley of Death. An Apache attack wipes out the train except for a bunch of young pioneers (Felicia Farr, Nick Adams, Susan Kohner, Ray Stricklyn, Stephanie Griffin and child star, Tommy Rettig) and Comanche Todd. Todd sacrifices his newfound freedom to lead the band to the safety of a fort some 300 miles away. The film moves well and Widmark is perfect as the individualistic Todd who found himself a new community/family.Delmer Daves brings another classic western to life by presenting a sympathetic and realistic view of the Indian culture and bigotry. He makes this western which could have devolved into a simple pioneers versus Indians tale into a dramatic survival tale with a heart. The various characters&#8217; prejudices and social attitudes seem in contrast to their faith which matures into true Christianity by the end of the film.  Comanche Todd's own feeling for his people, and his rejection of his father&#8217;s faith (Christianity) is seen as a strength until he realizes that has developed his own set of morals based on justice, love and defending his people (family).  This solid drama is also helped by the Technicolor and Cinemascope on-location photography of Arizona by Wilfred Cline.

An adventure leads a group of greenhorns through dangerous territory, teaching them survival and self respect along the way.This is such a well acted and directed piece though, that it hardly matters if we've already been there.Widmark plays a white man raised by Comanches who is being dragged across backwoods by a sadistic Sheriff(George Matthews), until they come across a Wagon Train.Widmark slays the Sheriff and is locked up by the Wagon Party. That night, the Apaches massacre the entire party, except for a group of youths who escaped to go swimming. Widmark is found at the bottom of a ravine, is hoisted up and from there on in, fights to get the kids out of hostile territory.Widmark is great in the lead role. Hard edged and believable in the Action scenes, as well as being sensitive and wise as he teaches the kids how to survive against the odds. It's a very, underrated performance in his career.The rest of the cast is notable, all the kids performing adequately. Each one going through a believable transformation by film's end. Felicia Farr stands out as Widmark's love interest. Likeable and lovely and able to understand the darkness that drives Widmark's ""Commanche Todd"" character to such extremes.The location shooting is effective and among the best of the mid-fifties Westerns. There's a genuine loveliness to the desert surroundings as there is a sense of impending doom. Delmer Daves handles the proceeding nicely and gives the film a good, brisk pace that keeps the film moving along. It's the kind of film that many a modern picture could profit by:intelligent, adventurous, and hopeful.

973761,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B000EHSVVY,Muzzlehatch,"[3, 3]","Director and screenwriter Delmer Daves is almost certainly best-known nowadays for the 1957 3:10 TO YUMA, a taught and suspenseful, almost minimalist character-driven western in black and white which got a new lease on life when it was remade 50 years later.  Otherwise, Daves' many westerns have faded somewhat in the collective cineaste consciousness, at least in comparison with his contemporaries John Ford, Anthony Mann, Howard Hawks and Budd Boetticher, and though these are all names worthy of remembering, it's a bit of a shame that Daves hasn't stayed in their company, as he was doing some of the most interesting and progressive work in the genre during it's heyday.Daves specialized in films dealing with Indians, and starting with his very first western, BROKEN ARROW (1950) he always treated them more sympathetically than his peers did.  THE LAST WAGON is no exception, though the ""real"" natives play an antagonistic and largely offscreen role throughout the film.  Richard Widmark stars as Comanche Todd, a white man raised by the tribe of the same name since childhood, who self-identifies primarily as a native.  We meet him on the run from three men in a valley in Arizona.  One he picks off right away; another (played by an unidentified Timothy Carey) after losing his gun and improvising a trap; the third, Sherriff Bull Harper (George Matthews in an over-the-top but wonderful display of brutality and callousness) captures him and attempts to drag him back to civilization.  He's killed three men apparently and Harper means to hang him.  But soon Harper and Comanche run into a wagon train of Christian settlers and join up with them - and soon afterwards, the wagon train meets a band of Apaches, and only a few younger members of the group and Comanche manage to survive.From this point on the film becomes a survival and chase story, with Comanche trying to lead the reluctant settlers through the ""Canyon of Death"" to safety, and having to contend with their animosity and hatred towards him - more for being a ""savage"" than for his alleged crimes - and their contentious feelings towards each other, most obviously in the case of the white Valinda (Stephanie Griffin) and her half-Navajo half-sister Jolie (Susan Kohner).  Jolie likes Comanche right away, as do Billy (child star Tommy Rettig) and his sister Jenny (Felicia Farr) with whom Comanche develops a mutual attraction fairly quickly.  Clint and Ridge (Ray Stricklyn and Nick Adams), the latter also unfriendly towards Comanche, complete the party.  They have between them one single revolver, and little water or food, so it's up to the white Indian to get them through things.What's refreshing about THE LAST WAGON to me is that the prejudices and attitudes of the party seem to develop and change pretty organically - sure, a lot happens over the course of a few days, but what's really going on is that these ""Christians"" start to really act the way the best elements of their faith instruct them to, and they start to treat Comanche - and each other - as real human beings, and not as stereotypes.  And Comanche's feeling for his people, and his non-Christian spirituality, is never mocked or disavowed by the film - and clearly serves him better than the piousness of the settlers.Widmark was as comfortable in the western hero role as he was in the underbelly of noir, and this is a terrific, almost invisible performance, a character that he seems to inhabit like an old robe that he knows every stitch of; the rest of the cast is fine but apart from Matthews' brutal sherriff I can't say they make a huge impression.  The Technicolor, Cinemascope on-location photography in Arizona by Wilfred Cline is just spectacular - this must have really been something on the big screen.  The only real problem with the film, and it's not insignificant, is in the ending courtroom scene, which ties up all of the moral ambiguities way too neatly.  It's kind of uplifting, and the film's heart was in the right place in regards to it's attitude about Native Americans, but after the tough survival story we've watched for an hour and a half, it's just too easy.Still a terrific, well above-average 50s western, and I look forward to getting more into Daves' filmography.  The DVD looks fine; extras include trailers for several other westerns from the period, production sketches, and poster art.",4,"Widmark shines in beautiful, morally complex Delmer Daves western",1266278400,"02 16, 2010",2010,4382,"['Director', 'screenwriter', 'Delmer', 'Daves', 'almost', 'certainly', 'best-known', 'nowadays', '1957', '3:10', 'TO', 'YUMA', 'taught', 'suspenseful', 'almost', 'minimalist', 'character-driven', 'western', 'black', 'white', 'got', 'new', 'lease', 'life', 'when', 'was', 'remade', '50', 'years', 'later', 'Otherwise', 'Daves', 'many', 'westerns', 'have', 'faded', 'somewhat', 'collective', 'cineaste', 'consciousness', 'least', 'comparison', 'contemporaries', 'John', 'Ford', 'Anthony', 'Mann', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'Budd', 'Boetticher', 'are', 'names', 'worthy', 'remembering', 'bit', 'shame', ""n't"", 'stayed', 'company', 'was', 'doing', 'most', 'interesting', 'progressive', 'work', 'genre', 'heyday.Daves', 'specialized', 'films', 'dealing', 'Indians', 'starting', 'very', 'first', 'western', 'BROKEN', 'ARROW', '1950', 'always', 'treated', 'more', 'sympathetically', 'peers', 'did', 'THE', 'LAST', 'WAGON', 'exception', 'real', 'natives', 'play', 'antagonistic', 'largely', 'offscreen', 'role', 'film', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'Comanche', 'Todd', 'white', 'man', 'raised', 'tribe', 'same', 'name', 'childhood', 'who', 'primarily', 'native', 'meet', 'run', 'three', 'men', 'valley', 'Arizona', 'One', 'off', 'right', 'away', 'played', 'unidentified', 'Timothy', 'Carey', 'losing', 'gun', 'improvising', 'trap', 'third', 'Sherriff', 'Bull', 'Harper', 'George', 'Matthews', 'over-the-top', 'wonderful', 'display', 'brutality', 'callousness', 'attempts', 'drag', 'back', 'civilization', 'killed', 'three', 'men', 'apparently', 'Harper', 'hang', 'soon', 'Harper', 'Comanche', 'run', 'wagon', 'train', 'Christian', 'settlers', 'join', 'up', 'soon', 'afterwards', 'wagon', 'train', 'band', 'Apaches', 'only', 'few', 'younger', 'members', 'group', 'Comanche', 'manage', 'survive.From', 'point', 'film', 'survival', 'chase', 'story', 'Comanche', 'trying', 'lead', 'reluctant', 'settlers', 'Canyon', 'Death', 'safety', 'having', 'contend', 'animosity', 'hatred', 'towards', 'more', 'being', 'savage', 'alleged', 'crimes', 'contentious', 'feelings', 'towards', 'other', 'most', 'obviously', 'case', 'white', 'Valinda', 'Stephanie', 'Griffin', 'half-Navajo', 'half-sister', 'Jolie', 'Susan', 'Kohner', 'Jolie', 'Comanche', 'right', 'away', 'do', 'Billy', 'child', 'star', 'Tommy', 'Rettig', 'sister', 'Jenny', 'Felicia', 'Farr', 'whom', 'Comanche', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'Clint', 'Ridge', 'Ray', 'Stricklyn', 'Nick', 'Adams', 'latter', 'also', 'unfriendly', 'towards', 'Comanche', 'complete', 'party', 'have', 'one', 'single', 'revolver', 'little', 'water', 'food', 'up', 'white', 'Indian', 'get', 'things.What', 'refreshing', 'THE', 'LAST', 'WAGON', 'prejudices', 'attitudes', 'party', 'seem', 'develop', 'change', 'pretty', 'organically', 'sure', 'lot', 'course', 'few', 'days', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'Christians', 'start', 'really', 'act', 'way', 'best', 'elements', 'faith', 'instruct', 'start', 'treat', 'Comanche', 'other', 'real', 'human', 'beings', 'not', 'stereotypes', 'Comanche', 'feeling', 'people', 'non-Christian', 'spirituality', 'never', 'mocked', 'disavowed', 'film', 'clearly', 'better', 'piousness', 'settlers.Widmark', 'was', 'comfortable', 'western', 'hero', 'role', 'was', 'underbelly', 'noir', 'terrific', 'almost', 'invisible', 'performance', 'character', 'inhabit', 'old', 'robe', 'stitch', 'rest', 'cast', 'fine', 'apart', 'Matthews', 'brutal', 'sherriff', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'make', 'huge', 'impression', 'Technicolor', 'Cinemascope', 'on-location', 'photography', 'Arizona', 'Wilfred', 'Cline', 'just', 'spectacular', 'must', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'something', 'big', 'screen', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'film', 'not', 'insignificant', 'ending', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'moral', 'ambiguities', 'way', 'too', 'neatly', 'kind', 'uplifting', 'film', 'heart', 'was', 'right', 'place', 'regards', 'attitude', 'Native', 'Americans', 'tough', 'survival', 'story', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'hour', 'half', 'just', 'too', 'easy.Still', 'terrific', 'well', 'above-average', '50s', 'western', 'look', 'forward', 'getting', 'more', 'Daves', 'filmography', 'DVD', 'fine', 'extras', 'include', 'trailers', 'several', 'other', 'westerns', 'period', 'production', 'sketches', 'poster', 'art']",The Last Wagon

973774,A879W035LBHRM,B000EHSVVY,"R. W. Kehr ""RONCHO""","[15, 18]","This film defined its audience and caters to it throughout. When it was made, westerns were at the peak of their popularity and the bulge of that bell curve was adolescent boys. Although Richard Widmark is the star, I think the focal point of the movie is filtered through the character of Billy played by Tommy Rettig. In the mid 50's, there was no more recognizable young TV star than Tommy Rettig who played Jeff on ""Lassie"". ""Lassie"" was on every Sunday early evening when every kid in America was home tuning in. They might laugh at ""Leave it to Beaver"" and think Wally was sorta cool, but openly or secretly, everyone wanted to be Jeff and live on a farm with a dog that was smarter than your math teacher.Richard Widmark's character is the kind of father figure a 10 year old American boy growing up in the 50's would envision, right down to the rather ludicrous name ""Commanche Todd"". At this juncture, it was cool to have lived with Indians and learned the ways of the wilderness but still have blonde hair and blue eyes.Even cooler, to teach these things to a young fatherless boy who happens to have an unattached beautiful sister.If this all sounds contrived, you'd be wrong. Delmer Daves is an accomplished director who keeps this movie interesting and somehow fresh throughout. I, or perhaps the 10 year old within, totally bought in to the plot and appreciated the whole movie like I'd been to a Saturday matinee. And one of the key elements of this film is probably the most outstanding color photography I've ever seen. In order to provide an experience that TV couldn't offer and ween people away from shows like ""Lassie"", studios filmed some productions in Cinemascope. This is one of the best of the bunch. With rich saturated Technicolor and the most photogenic Arizona locations you""ve ever seen, the overall widescreen effect is astounding-even on a 27 inch TV. I'm a big fan of Monument Valley and the Anthony Mann high country, but my first reaction to ""The Last Wagon"" was that this is the most beautiful western I've ever seen.",4,""" A  BOY'S LIFE""",1153353600,"07 20, 2006",2006,2054,"['film', 'defined', 'audience', 'caters', 'When', 'was', 'made', 'westerns', 'were', 'peak', 'popularity', 'bulge', 'bell', 'curve', 'was', 'adolescent', 'boys', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'star', 'think', 'focal', 'point', 'movie', 'filtered', 'character', 'Billy', 'played', 'Tommy', 'Rettig', 'mid', '50', 'was', 'more', 'recognizable', 'young', 'TV', 'star', 'Tommy', 'Rettig', 'who', 'played', 'Jeff', 'Lassie', 'Lassie', 'was', 'Sunday', 'early', 'evening', 'when', 'kid', 'America', 'was', 'home', 'tuning', 'might', 'laugh', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'think', 'Wally', 'was', 'sorta', 'cool', 'openly', 'secretly', 'everyone', 'wanted', 'be', 'Jeff', 'live', 'farm', 'dog', 'was', 'smarter', 'math', 'teacher.Richard', 'Widmark', 'character', 'kind', 'father', 'figure', '10', 'year', 'old', 'American', 'boy', 'growing', 'up', '50', 'would', 'envision', 'right', 'down', 'rather', 'ludicrous', 'name', 'Commanche', 'Todd', 'juncture', 'was', 'cool', 'have', 'lived', 'Indians', 'learned', 'ways', 'wilderness', 'still', 'have', 'blonde', 'hair', 'blue', 'eyes.Even', 'cooler', 'teach', 'things', 'young', 'fatherless', 'boy', 'who', 'have', 'unattached', 'beautiful', 'sister.If', 'contrived', ""'d"", 'be', 'wrong', 'Delmer', 'Daves', 'accomplished', 'director', 'who', 'movie', 'interesting', 'somehow', 'fresh', 'perhaps', '10', 'year', 'old', 'totally', 'bought', 'plot', 'appreciated', 'whole', 'movie', ""'d"", 'been', 'Saturday', 'matinee', 'one', 'key', 'elements', 'film', 'probably', 'most', 'outstanding', 'color', 'photography', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'order', 'provide', 'experience', 'TV', 'could', ""n't"", 'offer', 'ween', 'people', 'away', 'shows', 'Lassie', 'studios', 'filmed', 'productions', 'Cinemascope', 'one', 'best', 'bunch', 'rich', 'saturated', 'Technicolor', 'most', 'photogenic', 'Arizona', 'locations', 've', 'ever', 'seen', 'overall', 'widescreen', 'effect', 'astounding-even', '27', 'inch', 'TV', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Monument', 'Valley', 'Anthony', 'Mann', 'high', 'country', 'first', 'reaction', 'Last', 'Wagon', 'was', 'most', 'beautiful', 'western', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen']",The Last Wagon

Although he played his share of heroes, villains, and a little of both in a number of Westerns, his acting always seemed suited for delivering just the right tone at just the right time.In The Last Wagon, Widmark plays Comanche Todd, a white man raised with Indians and a wanted killer who took revenge on the men who killed his Indians wife and children. Captured by lawmen, Todd is kept by the lawmen at a wagon train headed through dangerous Apache territory. However, the Apaches attack the wagon train, leaving only Todd, two women, and children alive. Now Todd must try to get the family through hostile territory to the nearest fort and certain trial and execution for his crimes.In the hand of great Western movie director Delmer Daves, The Last Wagon has more than its share of excitement and tense moments. The actors are very good, even though the ending strains credibility to the limit. This is a film that deserved to be released on DVD, and Western film lovers should have a good time watching it.",4,Entertaining Widmark Western,1146700800,"05 4, 2006",2006,1104,"['Last', 'Wagon', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'proved', 'was', 'seamless', 'fit', 'Western', 'genre', 'played', 'share', 'heroes', 'villains', 'little', 'number', 'Westerns', 'acting', 'always', 'seemed', 'suited', 'delivering', 'just', 'right', 'tone', 'just', 'right', 'time.In', 'Last', 'Wagon', 'Widmark', 'Comanche', 'Todd', 'white', 'man', 'raised', 'Indians', 'wanted', 'killer', 'who', 'took', 'revenge', 'men', 'who', 'killed', 'Indians', 'wife', 'children', 'Captured', 'lawmen', 'Todd', 'kept', 'lawmen', 'wagon', 'train', 'headed', 'through', 'dangerous', 'Apache', 'territory', 'However', 'Apaches', 'attack', 'wagon', 'train', 'leaving', 'only', 'Todd', 'two', 'women', 'children', 'alive', 'Now', 'Todd', 'must', 'try', 'get', 'family', 'hostile', 'territory', 'nearest', 'fort', 'certain', 'trial', 'execution', 'crimes.In', 'hand', 'great', 'Western', 'movie', 'director', 'Delmer', 'Daves', 'Last', 'Wagon', 'more', 'share', 'excitement', 'tense', 'moments', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'even', 'ending', 'strains', 'credibility', 'limit', 'film', 'deserved', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'Western', 'film', 'lovers', 'should', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'watching']",The Last Wagon
973777,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B000EHSVVY,Westley,"[0, 0]","Richard Widmark is Comanche Todd, a white man who was raised by the Comanche.  He's captured by a sheriff who accuses Todd of murdering three brothers.  As the sheriff takes him into custody, they come across a wagon train of families.  The families initially welcome the sheriff and Todd; however, they later turn on Todd, not realizing that they will later have to put their trust in the man as they try to escape an attack from warring Apaches.  The plot of ""The Last Wagon"" is fairly typical of 1950s westerns, with holes big enough through which to drive the titular wagon.  Fortunately, there are enough quirks in the movie to keep it interesting.Richard Widmark does a nice job with his ambiguous character, although he seems to be emulating John Wayne at times.  Susan Kohner (""Imitation of Life"") makes one of her rare movie appearances as a half-Indian, half-white young woman; her performance is believable and quite touching.  Tommy Rettig also gets a few laughs as the prerequisite of 1950s westerns - the young boy who worships our protagonist.  Some scenes are horribly hokey and unbelievable, such as some silliness involving a night-time swim party, but the movie generally stays on track.  ""The Last Wagon"" was filmed largely on location near Sedona, Arizona, which gives it a more realistic feel.  Director Delmer Daves' earlier western, ""Broken Arrow,"" had helped popularize the area, and the movie really benefits from the beautiful scenery.  ""The Last Wagon"" is a pretty enjoyable 1950s western that manages to avoid most clich&eacute;s of the genre.  It's clearly a second-tier western but still enjoyable.",4,Better than expected,1238803200,"04 4, 2009",2009,1629,"['Richard', 'Widmark', 'Comanche', 'Todd', 'white', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'raised', 'Comanche', 'captured', 'sheriff', 'who', 'Todd', 'murdering', 'three', 'brothers', 'sheriff', 'custody', 'come', 'wagon', 'train', 'families', 'families', 'initially', 'welcome', 'sheriff', 'Todd', 'however', 'later', 'turn', 'Todd', 'not', 'realizing', 'will', 'later', 'have', 'put', 'trust', 'man', 'try', 'escape', 'attack', 'warring', 'Apaches', 'plot', 'Last', 'Wagon', 'fairly', 'typical', '1950s', 'westerns', 'holes', 'big', 'enough', 'drive', 'titular', 'wagon', 'Fortunately', 'are', 'enough', 'quirks', 'movie', 'keep', 'interesting.Richard', 'Widmark', 'nice', 'job', 'ambiguous', 'character', 'be', 'emulating', 'John', 'Wayne', 'times', 'Susan', 'Kohner', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'one', 'rare', 'movie', 'appearances', 'half-Indian', 'half-white', 'young', 'woman', 'performance', 'believable', 'quite', 'touching', 'Tommy', 'Rettig', 'also', 'few', 'laughs', 'prerequisite', '1950s', 'westerns', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'protagonist', 'scenes', 'are', 'horribly', 'hokey', 'unbelievable', 'such', 'silliness', 'involving', 'night-time', 'swim', 'party', 'movie', 'generally', 'track', 'Last', 'Wagon', 'was', 'filmed', 'largely', 'location', 'Sedona', 'Arizona', 'more', 'realistic', 'feel', 'Director', 'Delmer', 'Daves', 'earlier', 'western', 'Broken', 'Arrow', 'had', 'helped', 'popularize', 'area', 'movie', 'really', 'benefits', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'Last', 'Wagon', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', '1950s', 'western', 'avoid', 'most', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'genre', 'clearly', 'second-tier', 'western', 'still', 'enjoyable']",The Last Wagon

973780,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B000EHSVVY,Wuchak,"[4, 5]","I caught ""The Last Wagon"" for the first time on tv many, many moons ago. All I remember is that it kicked total axx from beginning to end. Seeing it again last night, I'm happy to report that this 1956 Western holds up well despite the dated score.THE STORY: Richard Widmark stars as Comanche Todd, a white man raised by Comanches and under arrest for murder. Deep in hostile Apache territory he soon finds himself the leader of a small group of youths from a wagon train. Will they make it out alive? And, even if they do, can Todd escape the sentence of death-by-hanging?First of all, this film is gorgeous to look at -- shot on location in Sedona, Arizona, at the mouth of Oak Creek Canyon.Secondly, not only is the plot excellent, so are the characters, cast and everything else. The film successfully takes you back to the late 1800s and gives a good glimpse of what it must have been like to travel out West during that time.Felicia Farr and Susan Kohner stand out in the supporting cast; both are incredibly beautiful. Each youth has his/her issue(s) and grows much as a result of their experiences with Comanche Todd and the dire situation. For instance, Susan (Jolie) is ashamed that she's half-Indian but Todd teaches her to be proud of who and what she is. Others hate Todd for being an ""injun lover"" but later see the error of their ways. Todd himself is lost in in a fog of bitterness & revenge but a new potential family is thrown in his lap. Can he get over his disillusionment to see the blessing in his current situation? This is just a taste of the character arcs addressed in the story.Stop the presses! Christianity and Christians are actually portrayed in a positive light -- amazing! Yet so are the beliefs/practices of the Natives. The film does an outstanding job of taking the middle road with the settlers and the natives. Not to mention, the Indians are portrayed realistically, unlike many 50's Westerns where you just roll your eyes at their silly depiction.Aside from the dated score (which isn't bad, just dated), the only negative I can cite would be the way in which the conflict with the Apaches is concluded. But the film makes up for it with a powerful end-commentary on the nature of universal justice.The dvd features both the widescreen and fullscreen versions.MY GRADE: A",5,One of the best Westerns of the 50s,1246665600,"07 4, 2009",2009,2311,"['caught', 'Last', 'Wagon', 'first', 'time', 'tv', 'many', 'many', 'moons', 'ago', 'remember', 'kicked', 'total', 'axx', 'beginning', 'end', 'Seeing', 'again', 'last', 'night', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', '1956', 'Western', 'up', 'well', 'dated', 'score.THE', 'STORY', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'Comanche', 'Todd', 'white', 'man', 'raised', 'Comanches', 'arrest', 'murder', 'Deep', 'hostile', 'Apache', 'territory', 'soon', 'leader', 'small', 'group', 'youths', 'wagon', 'train', 'Will', 'make', 'out', 'alive', 'even', 'do', 'can', 'Todd', 'escape', 'sentence', 'death-by-hanging', 'First', 'all', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'shot', 'location', 'Sedona', 'Arizona', 'mouth', 'Oak', 'Creek', 'Canyon.Secondly', 'not', 'only', 'plot', 'excellent', 'so', 'are', 'characters', 'cast', 'everything', 'else', 'film', 'successfully', 'back', 'late', '1800s', 'good', 'glimpse', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'travel', 'out', 'West', 'time.Felicia', 'Farr', 'Susan', 'Kohner', 'stand', 'out', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'youth', 'his/her', 'issue', 's', 'much', 'result', 'experiences', 'Comanche', 'Todd', 'dire', 'situation', 'instance', 'Susan', 'Jolie', 'ashamed', 'half-Indian', 'Todd', 'be', 'proud', 'who', 'what', 'Others', 'hate', 'Todd', 'being', 'injun', 'lover', 'later', 'see', 'error', 'ways', 'Todd', 'lost', 'fog', 'bitterness', 'revenge', 'new', 'potential', 'family', 'thrown', 'lap', 'Can', 'get', 'disillusionment', 'see', 'blessing', 'current', 'situation', 'just', 'taste', 'character', 'arcs', 'addressed', 'story.Stop', 'presses', 'Christianity', 'Christians', 'are', 'actually', 'portrayed', 'positive', 'light', 'amazing', 'so', 'are', 'beliefs/practices', 'Natives', 'film', 'outstanding', 'job', 'taking', 'middle', 'road', 'settlers', 'natives', 'Not', 'mention', 'Indians', 'are', 'portrayed', 'realistically', 'many', '50', 'Westerns', 'where', 'just', 'roll', 'eyes', 'silly', 'depiction.Aside', 'dated', 'score', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'dated', 'only', 'negative', 'can', 'cite', 'would', 'be', 'way', 'conflict', 'Apaches', 'concluded', 'film', 'up', 'powerful', 'end-commentary', 'nature', 'universal', 'justice.The', 'dvd', 'widescreen', 'fullscreen', 'versions.MY', 'GRADE', 'A']",The Last Wagon
