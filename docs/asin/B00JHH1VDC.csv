I have always felt that with any TV series, the entire series should be released up front rather than as individual seasons. Doing so after one or more seasons have already been released  takes advantage of the customer. By the way, fans of the series are not all in agreement as to which seasons are the best. I prefer seasons 3 through 5.",5,Finally!!,1401235200,"05 28, 2014",2014,499,"['Yes', 'also', 'purchased', 'season', 'one', 'will', 'now', 'have', 'duplicate', 'preferable', 'waiting', 'years', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'be', 'released', 'individually', 'have', 'always', 'felt', 'TV', 'series', 'entire', 'series', 'should', 'be', 'released', 'up', 'front', 'rather', 'individual', 'seasons', 'Doing', 'so', 'one', 'more', 'seasons', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'released', 'advantage', 'customer', 'way', 'fans', 'series', 'are', 'not', 'all', 'agreement', 'seasons', 'are', 'best', 'prefer', 'seasons', '3', '5']","Welcome Back, Kotter: The Complete Series"
1696648,A60PQSFWSQK8K,B00JHH1VDC,Erik Rupp,"[2, 2]","Welcome Back Kotter is a time capsule of the mid 70's.  It's a fairly sanitized version of reality, but it is a fun, and funny, show all the same.  The cast was perfect for their roles, and the writing really hit home and gives the viewer a good idea of what the 70's were like.  WBK is almost like a 1950's style take on the 1970's.  It's edgier than a show would have been in the 50's, but definitely a toned down version of what the reality was in the mid 70's.Great cast, fairly good writing, and a lot of fun.  It's an entertaining show.And the price is right.  Break down the cost per season and you're right in line with what the first season cost when it came out a few years back.  The full series set is well worth buying if you're curious about the show, or if you grew up watching Mr. Kotter and the Sweathogs.",5,Fun Show - Great Price!,1404518400,"07 5, 2014",2014,822,"['Welcome', 'Back', 'Kotter', 'time', 'capsule', 'mid', '70', 'fairly', 'sanitized', 'version', 'reality', 'fun', 'funny', 'show', 'same', 'cast', 'was', 'perfect', 'roles', 'writing', 'really', 'hit', 'home', 'viewer', 'good', 'idea', 'what', '70', 'were', 'like', 'WBK', 'almost', '1950', 'style', 'take', '1970', 'edgier', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'been', '50', 'definitely', 'toned', 'down', 'version', 'what', 'reality', 'was', 'mid', ""70's.Great"", 'cast', 'fairly', 'good', 'writing', 'lot', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'show.And', 'price', 'right', 'Break', 'down', 'cost', 'season', ""'re"", 'right', 'line', 'what', 'first', 'season', 'cost', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'full', 'series', 'set', 'well', 'worth', 'buying', ""'re"", 'curious', 'show', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Mr.', 'Kotter', 'Sweathogs']","Welcome Back, Kotter: The Complete Series"

Would consider purchasing it if it were not for the greed of Shout Factory and charging an outrageous price for only a 3 season show. Some say it was 4-5 seasons, but by the time season 4-5 came around, most of the the original cast had left and the show never had a chance to survive afterwards. Good thing Gable Craplan turned to playing poker or he would have become a street bum. For $116.99, please protest this outrageous price by not buying this series!

Henderson ""Michael Moviespast""","[2, 8]","My beef with Shout is not the price at this point but their occasional Shout Exclusives which is fine but they don't ship outside US which is me. Then the later release of Marx Bros material has a BONUS disc which is only in the sets bought direct from them which cuts me out again. As what I believe is a taped show, it maybe not be that great a quality for Blu ray but I would have liked to go that way with these shows and I have a few older series now as of this month in Blu Ray format like I Love Lucy, Little House, Jackie Gleason & Andy Griffith.
