I saw that it was available on Amazon Instant View, and that it had a 4 1/2 star customer rating, so I decided to watch it. I knew that the critics had given it poor reviews, but I generally go by the general publics perception rather than the overly cynical film critics. After watching It's Kind of a Funny Story, I agree with the critics...this was not a good film.1. The young star of the film is a lousy actor. He's supposed to be portraying someone who is suicidal, or who has suicidal thoughts...but he plays the character like he's just an awkward everyday teenager.2. The film depicts people within the psychiatric ward as more quirky than mentally ill.3. The relationships and actions between the characters aren't really believable.4. A lot of this film is forced and cliche; For instance, the ""running around with my gal and having fun"" montage. Or the man who is haunted by his past, and is slow to open up.5. More than anything, the film tries to be serious at times, and tackle the issues of mental illness, but then it tries to be fun and quirky at other times. I think the two sides can exist in a movie, but it wasn't pulled off well in this move.Save your time and money, and skip this movie.",2,It's Kind of a Painfully Bad Movie,1299974400,"03 13, 2011",2011,1298,"['saw', 'previews', 'wanted', 'see', 'theater', 'never', 'got', 'saw', 'was', 'available', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'View', 'had', '4', '1/2', 'star', 'customer', 'rating', 'decided', 'watch', 'knew', 'critics', 'had', 'given', 'poor', 'reviews', 'generally', 'go', 'general', 'publics', 'perception', 'rather', 'overly', 'cynical', 'film', 'critics', 'watching', 'Kind', 'Funny', 'Story', 'agree', 'critics', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'film.1', 'young', 'star', 'film', 'lousy', 'actor', 'supposed', 'be', 'portraying', 'someone', 'who', 'suicidal', 'who', 'suicidal', 'thoughts', 'character', 'just', 'awkward', 'everyday', 'teenager.2', 'film', 'people', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'more', 'quirky', 'mentally', 'ill.3', 'relationships', 'actions', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'believable.4', 'lot', 'film', 'forced', 'cliche', 'instance', 'running', 'around', 'gal', 'having', 'fun', 'montage', 'man', 'who', 'haunted', 'past', 'slow', 'open', 'up.5', 'More', 'anything', 'film', 'tries', 'be', 'serious', 'times', 'tackle', 'issues', 'mental', 'illness', 'then', 'be', 'fun', 'quirky', 'other', 'times', 'think', 'two', 'sides', 'can', 'exist', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'pulled', 'off', 'well', 'move.Save', 'time', 'money', 'skip', 'movie']",N/A

Nevertheless, I gave it a try anyways, and I'm glad I did. GREAT film! This dramedy stars newcomer Keir Gilchrist, Zach Galifianakis (the funny guy fromThe Hangover (Unrated Edition) [Blu-ray], who does such an amazing job with drama in this), and Emma Roberts (who does another surprisingly good job), along with the rest of the cast, create realistic, likeable characters you want to know. Based on the young adult novel by Ned Vizzini, the story follows 16-year-old Craig Gilner who admits himself into a psychiatric hospital ward to treat his depression. It's a coming-of-age story in a very unlikely setting, but, trust me, it's really good. It blends drama and comedy just right -- without being too silly or too melodramatic.

1322861,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0034G4OZE,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 7]","Ok, you ever see a trailer for a film and think that it looks remarkable only to find that the trailer is nearly one-hundred times better than the actual film?  That was the case with `It's Kind of a Funny Story'.  I saw the trailer a while back and just thought it was going to be outstanding, but alas; it wasn't.For me, the films biggest distracter is that it feels so uneven in tone.  It doesn't really know what kind of film it wants to be.  Well, I know what it wants to be.  It's shooting for `dramedy', but there isn't enough of either (drama or comedy) to constitute the genre reference.  Instead, it just falls flat nearly all of the time, despite some nicely constructed performances from the supporting cast.The film follows a young boy named Craig who wants to kill himself, or at least thinks that he wants to kill himself.  So, he seeks out immediate help from a psychiatric ward but winds up admitted for a mandatory five-days.  He feels out of water and awkward until he really sinks into the feel of the place and soon he learns so much yadda, yadda, yadda.  See, even typing the films synopsis feels flat, right?  This is my issue with the film.  It doesn't do anything special to elevate the films lack of original prose.  It just meanders.  The character arc given to Craig feels predictable and unwarranted (five days drastically changed his outlook so much, and HOW might I ask?) and so the ending feels forgettable and bland in texture.I found myself bored, even when the film tried to add texture by giving us flashback tricks and segments of voice over sequences.  It felt forced and low level and amateurish and nothing like what it was trying to copy.It's hard for me to imagine that Ryan Fleck directed this, since his directorial debut `Half Nelson' was so outstanding and serves as one of my favorite films of the past decade.Alas, the film is littered with very good supporting performances that try their hand at elevating their scenes.  Viola Davis is just a joy to look at, and she adds a warmth and sincerity to the preposterous psychiatric sessions she is a part of (I mean, seriously) and Emma Roberts is also decent here, and sells her character well.  But the film really belongs to Zach Galifianakis, who just delivers such a surprisingly honest portrait of a man who is battling his inner demons.  He adds the paternal touch needed for the film without going overly nostalgic or sappy on us.  Even when the film falls off the edge and dives headfirst into a saccharine mess, Galifianakis remains the film's sole look at something true; something real.UGH, I wanted this to be great.  Instead, it feels cheap and unfocused.  See it for Galifianakis, especially if you are a fan of his breed of comedy since he uses it with sharp maturity here, but don't expect this film to meet any preconceived expectations.",2,It's kind of not...,1300924800,"03 24, 2011",2011,2850,"['Ok', 'ever', 'see', 'trailer', 'film', 'think', 'remarkable', 'only', 'find', 'trailer', 'nearly', 'one-hundred', 'times', 'better', 'actual', 'film', 'was', 'case', 'Kind', 'Funny', 'Story', 'saw', 'trailer', 'while', 'back', 'just', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'outstanding', 'alas', 'films', 'biggest', 'distracter', 'so', 'uneven', 'tone', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'film', 'be', 'Well', 'know', 'what', 'be', 'shooting', 'dramedy', ""n't"", 'enough', 'drama', 'comedy', 'constitute', 'genre', 'reference', 'Instead', 'just', 'flat', 'nearly', 'time', 'nicely', 'constructed', 'performances', 'supporting', 'cast.The', 'film', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Craig', 'who', 'kill', 'least', 'thinks', 'kill', 'So', 'out', 'immediate', 'help', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'up', 'admitted', 'mandatory', 'five-days', 'water', 'awkward', 'really', 'feel', 'place', 'soon', 'so', 'much', 'yadda', 'yadda', 'yadda', 'See', 'even', 'typing', 'films', 'synopsis', 'feels', 'flat', 'right', 'issue', 'film', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'special', 'elevate', 'films', 'lack', 'original', 'prose', 'just', 'meanders', 'character', 'arc', 'given', 'Craig', 'feels', 'predictable', 'unwarranted', 'five', 'days', 'drastically', 'changed', 'outlook', 'so', 'much', 'HOW', 'might', 'ask', 'so', 'ending', 'feels', 'forgettable', 'bland', 'texture.I', 'found', 'bored', 'even', 'when', 'film', 'tried', 'add', 'texture', 'giving', 'flashback', 'tricks', 'segments', 'voice', 'sequences', 'felt', 'forced', 'low', 'level', 'amateurish', 'nothing', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'copy.It', 'hard', 'imagine', 'Ryan', 'Fleck', 'directed', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'was', 'so', 'outstanding', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'past', 'decade.Alas', 'film', 'littered', 'very', 'good', 'supporting', 'performances', 'try', 'hand', 'elevating', 'scenes', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'just', 'joy', 'look', 'warmth', 'sincerity', 'preposterous', 'psychiatric', 'sessions', 'part', 'mean', 'seriously', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'also', 'decent', 'here', 'character', 'well', 'film', 'really', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'who', 'just', 'delivers', 'such', 'surprisingly', 'honest', 'portrait', 'man', 'who', 'battling', 'inner', 'demons', 'paternal', 'touch', 'needed', 'film', 'going', 'overly', 'nostalgic', 'sappy', 'Even', 'when', 'film', 'edge', 'headfirst', 'saccharine', 'mess', 'Galifianakis', 'film', 'sole', 'look', 'something', 'true', 'something', 'real.UGH', 'wanted', 'be', 'great', 'Instead', 'cheap', 'unfocused', 'See', 'Galifianakis', 'especially', 'are', 'fan', 'breed', 'comedy', 'sharp', 'maturity', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'film', 'meet', 'preconceived', 'expectations']",N/A
1322862,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0034G4OZE,Andy Orrock,"[1, 2]","I'm an unabashed fan of the work of the filmmaking duo Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden.Half Nelsonwas a small masterpiece.  The under-appreciatedSugarwas also superb.  And, I really liked Fleck's work inIn Treatment: Season Two.  He helmed most the 'Oliver' arc - the standout story of that dark season.This film makes it three in a row, though frankly it doesn't measure up to the brilliance of the previous two outings.  You can tell Fleck and Boden have a growing reputation though: there's a quite a list of performers...Viola Davis, Emma Roberts, Zach Galifianakis, Lauren Graham, Jim Gaffigan.  But, ultimately, whether you cotton to this film or not falls squarely on the head of then-17-year-old Keir Gilchrist.  He does a superb job carrying the film: he's likable and believable as someone carrying just a little bit too much weight on his shoulders and lacking the perspective to shrug it off.The little Easter Egg inside the film is a brilliant, all-in-the-head, fully costumed sing-along of the Queen/Bowie smash 'Under Pressure' featuring Gilchrist's Craig in full-out Freddie Mercury mode.  It reminded me (more than just a little bit) of Marc Lawrence's sneakily goodMusic and Lyrics (Widescreen Edition), the highlight of which is a blow-it-out, late-80s-style video featuring Hugh Grant and an underused Scott Porter as a Wham!-like duo doing their [fully fictional] smash ""Pop Goes My Heart.""

1322863,A1JLIG5EIQZMD0,B0034G4OZE,aquestari,"[0, 1]","As movies go, it is watchable, a storyline you can follow and kill some hours if nothing else. I went into this movie thinking, 'Good, we'll get to see a movie about the days in the lives of psych patients' - instead, I found a completely bizarre, unbelievable storyline about a Hollywood movie version of a psych ward with no real heart or depth.I know movies are supposed to be a step into unreality at times and stretching the truth and I don't claim to know what every single mental ward in hospitals are like, but I could not help watching this and shaking my head at the experiences Craig had whilst he was in there. For example, the freedom he had to use the phone when he liked. A phone hanging there for everyone to use as they please in a public hospital psychiatric ward? No having to ask to use a phone and being monitored or given a limit of calls per day like in actual psych wards? I don't think so. A person being allowed to stay in bed and sleep for weeks without the staff bothering him about it, helping him, or kicking him out and only with the help of patients is he able to get out of bed? Ridiculous. And being able to open a door to get to other parts of the hospital so easily? In actuality all doors would be locked and you would need to nurse to buzz you out if you were to go anywhere, such is the safe haven of a psychiatric ward, designed to make sure people cannot harm themselves or run away when they need treatment. I don't know how much time people in psych wards have for worrying about teen love angst (and between patients!) and dropping letters/arranging meetups. Nor is kissing encouraged or allowed in these wards. Craig was supposed to go to activities in this movie to help with his depression but you did not get to see this or get any sense of what groups are like in a psych ward. He may as well have been in a holiday hotel with occasional therapy sessions and a good lot of the time being able to do what he pleases.There was nothing in this movie that reflected the true experience of being inside a psych ward, apart from the characters you see who have mental health issues, staring into space or shouting out, throwing tantrums, cutting themselves, things like that; and half the time the characters are saying how 'crazy' they all are for acting this way, or disrespecting a schizophrenic for talking aloud, to their friend, etc. The end of the movie seems to focus on quick fixes and sugary endings. I think the movie could have been both serious and light at the same time but had a lot lot more to it than it did. There were some nice moments of character bonding between the males in the ward, stories of their life and inspirational quotes, on the positive side.",2,review.,1383868800,"11 8, 2013",2013,2720,"['movies', 'go', 'watchable', 'storyline', 'can', 'follow', 'kill', 'hours', 'nothing', 'else', 'went', 'movie', 'thinking', ""'ll"", 'get', 'see', 'movie', 'days', 'lives', 'psych', 'patients', 'instead', 'found', 'completely', 'bizarre', 'unbelievable', 'storyline', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'version', 'psych', 'ward', 'real', 'heart', 'depth.I', 'know', 'movies', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'step', 'unreality', 'times', 'stretching', 'truth', 'do', ""n't"", 'claim', 'know', 'what', 'single', 'mental', 'ward', 'hospitals', 'are', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'watching', 'shaking', 'head', 'experiences', 'Craig', 'had', 'whilst', 'was', 'there', 'example', 'freedom', 'had', 'use', 'phone', 'when', 'liked', 'A', 'phone', 'hanging', 'there', 'everyone', 'use', 'please', 'public', 'hospital', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'No', 'having', 'ask', 'use', 'phone', 'being', 'monitored', 'given', 'limit', 'calls', 'day', 'actual', 'psych', 'wards', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'person', 'being', 'allowed', 'stay', 'bed', 'sleep', 'weeks', 'staff', 'bothering', 'helping', 'kicking', 'out', 'only', 'help', 'patients', 'able', 'get', 'bed', 'Ridiculous', 'being', 'able', 'open', 'door', 'get', 'other', 'parts', 'hospital', 'so', 'easily', 'actuality', 'doors', 'would', 'be', 'locked', 'would', 'need', 'nurse', 'buzz', 'out', 'were', 'go', 'anywhere', 'such', 'safe', 'haven', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'designed', 'make', 'sure', 'people', 'can', 'not', 'harm', 'run', 'away', 'when', 'need', 'treatment', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'people', 'psych', 'wards', 'have', 'worrying', 'teen', 'love', 'angst', 'patients', 'dropping', 'letters/arranging', 'meetups', 'kissing', 'encouraged', 'allowed', 'wards', 'Craig', 'was', 'supposed', 'go', 'activities', 'movie', 'help', 'depression', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'see', 'get', 'sense', 'what', 'groups', 'are', 'psych', 'ward', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'holiday', 'hotel', 'occasional', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'good', 'lot', 'time', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'what', 'pleases.There', 'was', 'nothing', 'movie', 'reflected', 'true', 'experience', 'being', 'psych', 'ward', 'apart', 'characters', 'see', 'who', 'have', 'mental', 'health', 'issues', 'staring', 'space', 'shouting', 'out', 'throwing', 'tantrums', 'cutting', 'things', 'time', 'characters', 'are', 'saying', 'how', ""'crazy"", 'are', 'acting', 'way', 'disrespecting', 'schizophrenic', 'talking', 'aloud', 'friend', 'etc', 'end', 'movie', 'focus', 'quick', 'fixes', 'sugary', 'endings', 'think', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'serious', 'light', 'same', 'time', 'had', 'lot', 'lot', 'more', 'did', 'were', 'nice', 'moments', 'character', 'bonding', 'males', 'ward', 'stories', 'life', 'inspirational', 'quotes', 'positive', 'side']",N/A

He is not supposed to be hilarious in this movie and he isn't.  He does a decent enough job of acting but this role underutilizes him.  He was used to much better effect in HANGOVER.This film is about a teenage boy who is admitted to a mental hospital for five days of observation because he has suicidal impulses.  While there he meets Zach Galifianakis, Emma Roberts and a host of other oddball characters who are patients.The few teenagers are in with the adults.I spent six days in such a facility myself as someone who has always suffered from unipolar depression.  There are a lot of things which simply are not true about this rendering of this situation.  These are as follows:1) You are not allowed to stay in bed.  You have to get up and moving and come out of your room.  This is not done in this hospital. The boy's roommate stays in bed all day long.2) You are unable to leave the ward because it is locked down.  Yet Zach Galifianakis comes and goes at will and the boy and girl are able to go up to the roof.  None of this happens in real life.3) You do have both one on one and group therapy sessions.  Here by contrast you have very short therapy sessions while the rest of the time you hang out and get to know the other patients.  There is actually very little socializing with other patients.  You spend most of your time working with staff.4) Everyone takes medication.  It is not optional.  This is MAJOR part of everyone's day. I can't remember anyone taking it here.5) There is a physical exercise component to get you moving.  This is especially critical with depression patients.  Also missing here-pingpong is not physical enough.6) It seemed as if the hospital was allowed to keep him in without his permission (or his parents').  If he wanted out of there, there would have been a hearing of soryts and his parents would have had to sign him in involuntarily.  They did not seem the types to do so.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 0]","A coming of age story taking place in the mental ward of a hospital?Sign me up!Channel surfing rarely--too rarely--stumbles upon a gem that gleams like an opal in the deep.  IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY fits that mold; it is the bittersweet story of 16-year-old Craig (Keir Gilchrist, who nails this role), an insecure and depressed youth feeling not only teenage angst, but (self-induced) insurmountable pressures resulting in suicidal tendencies.  As the film begins Craig checks himself into a psychiatric ward--only to promptly harbor second feelings, as his fellow patients are. . .nuts.  Alas, Craig must stay a minimum of five days for evaluation--five days that turn out to be a defining and transformative transition in his young life.  Through Gilchrist's performance, Craig's insecure, yet tongue-in-cheek outlook on life can yield at any moment to Walter Mitty-esque fantasies; it's a point of view that's completely heartening and charming.Gilchrist is surrounded by a stellar supporting cast, headed by the outside-the-box Zach Galifianakis as Bobby, the astute psych ward veteran who takes Craig under his arm and becomes a dysfunctional mentor.  Yes, Galifianakis is funny, yet he also brings a poignant and compelling dimension to his role--augmented by his character's concern that Craig not follow in his problematic footsteps.  Emma Roberts gives an impressive performance as Noelle, another suicidal teen in the ward who becomes not only a friend, but a budding romantic interest.

They stand at the nurse's window at the top of the long, white hall leading to the cafeteria. The sterilized smell of the hospital is overwhelming. That's what Craig is experiencing as he apprehensively walks into the psychiatric hospital in It's Kind of a Funny Story by Ned Vizzini. This book takes you through the mental breakdown and healing process of a teenager, Craig, with depression and suicidal thoughts. It is captivating and makes you emotionally involved while reading and then leaves you pleasantly surprised at the end. Ned Vizzini did an excellent job with the events, plot, and characters.It's Kind of a Funny Story by Ned Vizzini was a very enjoyable, page turning novel.The book begins with focusing on Craig's daily life. Ned Vizzini goes through Craig's friends, school, family, issues, depression, and suicidal thoughts. It explains how Craig has had trouble with school and anxiety and fears of failure for a while now and sees a therapist. I find this a good, raw start to the book because you really grasp what's happening.Craig ends up in the psychiatric hospital one night. He was going to attempt suicide but decided he was too young and wanted to live, so he went to the hospital for help. Once he was told he would have to be staying in the hospital for help for two weeks, he than meets the other patients. I really enjoyed hearing about the people Craig meets because it makes the book seem more realistic. That is because they are very unique, real characters with their own different imperfections. Craig also meets a girl there, Noelle, who he ends up dating. They help each other out with their issues and are really able to connect.While in the hospital, the Craig has to participate in group activities, such as music and arts and crafts. He also has to go to therapy to figure out the source of his depression. This is the mystery in the book. Why is Craig depressed? He has an average, supportive family, goes to a high-end high school, and gets good grades. This keeps you guessing throughout the book, which I enjoyed. Then, during arts and crafts, Craig begins to make paintings and finds it very enjoyable. He continues to make them throughout his stay and finds that art really helps him to relax and enjoy himself. This is when things start to come together and solve themselves. You begin to predict the ending and solution to Craig's issues and get excited to keep reading and find out.Craig in this story is the protagonist and antagonist. I believe that because he was the main character of the story and the victim. But, he was also the perpetrator because he was his own issue. He was battling himself with his depression and suicidal thoughts and the solution to that was a change in himself. That is why I find this to be a great book, because the answer to the problem was somewhere no one would of thought to look.",5,It's Kind of a Funny Story,1319328000,"10 23, 2011",2011,3105,"['nurses', 'smile', 'politely', 'hand', 'out', 'morning', 'medications', 'patients', 'patients', 'chatter', 'aimlessly', 'wait', 'line', 'continuing', 'day', 'activities', 'breakfast', 'therapy', 'smoke', 'break', 'group', 'activities', 'stand', 'nurse', 'window', 'top', 'long', 'white', 'hall', 'leading', 'cafeteria', 'sterilized', 'smell', 'hospital', 'overwhelming', 'what', 'Craig', 'experiencing', 'apprehensively', 'psychiatric', 'hospital', 'Kind', 'Funny', 'Story', 'Ned', 'Vizzini', 'book', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'healing', 'process', 'teenager', 'Craig', 'depression', 'suicidal', 'thoughts', 'captivating', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'reading', 'then', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'end', 'Ned', 'Vizzini', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'events', 'plot', 'characters.It', 'Kind', 'Funny', 'Story', 'Ned', 'Vizzini', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'page', 'turning', 'novel.The', 'book', 'focusing', 'Craig', 'daily', 'life', 'Ned', 'Vizzini', 'Craig', 'friends', 'school', 'family', 'issues', 'depression', 'suicidal', 'thoughts', 'how', 'Craig', 'had', 'trouble', 'school', 'anxiety', 'fears', 'failure', 'while', 'now', 'therapist', 'find', 'good', 'raw', 'start', 'book', 'really', 'grasp', 'what', 'happening.Craig', 'up', 'psychiatric', 'hospital', 'one', 'night', 'was', 'going', 'attempt', 'suicide', 'decided', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'wanted', 'live', 'went', 'hospital', 'help', 'was', 'told', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'staying', 'hospital', 'help', 'two', 'weeks', 'other', 'patients', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'hearing', 'people', 'Craig', 'meets', 'book', 'seem', 'more', 'realistic', 'are', 'very', 'unique', 'real', 'characters', 'own', 'different', 'imperfections', 'Craig', 'also', 'girl', 'there', 'Noelle', 'who', 'up', 'dating', 'help', 'other', 'issues', 'are', 'really', 'able', 'connect.While', 'hospital', 'Craig', 'participate', 'group', 'activities', 'such', 'music', 'arts', 'crafts', 'also', 'go', 'therapy', 'figure', 'out', 'source', 'depression', 'mystery', 'book', 'Why', 'Craig', 'depressed', 'average', 'supportive', 'family', 'high-end', 'high', 'school', 'good', 'grades', 'guessing', 'book', 'enjoyed', 'Then', 'arts', 'crafts', 'Craig', 'make', 'paintings', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'make', 'stay', 'art', 'really', 'relax', 'enjoy', 'when', 'things', 'start', 'come', 'together', 'solve', 'begin', 'predict', 'ending', 'solution', 'Craig', 'issues', 'get', 'excited', 'keep', 'reading', 'find', 'out.Craig', 'story', 'protagonist', 'antagonist', 'believe', 'was', 'main', 'character', 'story', 'victim', 'was', 'also', 'perpetrator', 'was', 'own', 'issue', 'was', 'battling', 'depression', 'suicidal', 'thoughts', 'solution', 'was', 'change', 'why', 'find', 'be', 'great', 'book', 'answer', 'problem', 'was', 'somewhere', 'one', 'would', 'thought', 'look']",N/A

1322888,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0034G4OZE,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 4]","It's Kind of a Funny Story is a comedy-drama based on a novel by Ned Vizzini that seems to be cut from the same cloth tonally as(500) Days of Summer. It's written and directed by frequent collaborators Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck who were responsible for the impressive Ryan Gosling filmHalf Nelsona few years back and with that talent behind the camera and the talented cast in front of it this had the potential to be a great film. While some aspects are well-realized and some talented actors are given the chance to showcase a side of their talent I didn't know existed, It's Kind of a Funny Story is only kind of a good movie.16-year-old Craig (Keir Gilchrist) comes from a steady family and goes to a prestigious school in New York, but the mounting pressures that come with being a teenager have made him depressed and lead to him contemplating suicide. Seeking help at a local hospital, he is admitted to the inpatient psychiatric floor for a minimum stay of five days. With a lack of teenage patients, Craig is placed in the adult ward and naturally feels uncomfortable surrounded by some very troubled adult patients. He does however befriend Bobby (Zach Galifianakis), an adult patient who must leave the hospital within days for a halfway house. As the two begin slowly bonding, Craig meets Noelle (Emma Roberts), an eccentric and pretty teen patient. The film co-stars Zo Kravitz and Viola Davis with Lauren Graham and comedian Jim Gaffigan as Craig's parents.As one can expect from a movie set at a psychiatric hospital, the film has plenty of off-beat characters but does its best to avoid the clich&eacute;s that go along with this setting and keeps the focus on Craig and his relationships with those around him. While the main characters take center stage, the secondary characters remain in the background. The film does an exceptional job with the way it handles its teenage characters. It doesn't aspire to be a realistic portrait of teens, but the teenage characters are handled accurately and the script avoids making them overdramatic or overly stereotypical caricatures of real teenagers. They have teenage emotions, but they handle these emotions with much more maturity than we're used to seeing onscreen (The Twilight Saga being an example). The relationship between Craig and Noelle is particularly sweet, with seemingly genuine chemistry between Gilchrist and Roberts. It avoids sappy sentimentality and has a sweet awkwardness that really feels natural.Gilchrist does a fine job as Craig, never overdoing his portrayal as a confused, average teenager. There are some noticeable flaws in his acting, but none of these flaws take away from his performance and he does have the time and potential to grow. If this was a dark, emotional drama he'd be ill-fitted for the role, but the whimsical nature of the film allows him more freedom to be imperfect. His chemistry with Roberts feels very natural and Roberts does a great job with her character, even though Noelle doesn't seem fleshed-out enough. Roberts may appear a little too attractive for the role, but she's a good fit. Comedian Jim Gaffigan strays far from his stand-up persona and plays Craig's father with only a small dose of humor. If you've seen his stand-up, it may surprise you that Gaffigan can seem like a normal, serious man. When it comes to a comedian with an established persona attempting to distance himself from that, no one is more effective than Zach Galifianakis.As a comedian's popularity rises, they open themselves to more criticism and after starring roles in The Hangover andDue Date, Galifianakis had been written off by some as a one-dimensional comic actor. He was wise to take on the role of Bobby as he does a complete 180 from the screen persona he's established in those two movies and actually does a fine job. His performance as Bobby is a real surprise as he demonstrates a rather dynamic comedic range while displaying a surprising amount of emotional depth as well. He's convincing, likable, and totally disconnected from the persona that's made him famous.Despite being lumped into the ""dramedy"" category, It's Kind of a Funny Story leans much closer to drama but with a comedic tone that keeps it from taking itself too seriously. It's a likable film with likable characters but it frequently feels underwritten, ironic being based on a book. The script avoids clich&eacute;d dramatic moments and forced humor, but many story threads and character arcs don't feel fully developed. Look at the climactic scene involving Craig's Egyptian roommate for an example of this. It should be a ""big moment,"" but it just kind of...happens. It's Kind of a Funny Story is an entertaining, amusing film that doesn't do anything remarkable but doesn't really do anything wrong either. If you're looking for a whimsical ""dramedy"" that will put a smile on your face for a little under 100 minutes, it may be worth seeking out.GRADE: B-",4,It's Kind of a Good Movie,1297296000,"02 10,

The lead actor, Keir Gilchrist (Craig), nails his role as a somber and confused 16-year-old. The supporting cast is good as well, although the female love interest is a bit cardboard and the resolution clich&eacute;d. The psychiatric hospital is also much more benign than any I have encountered (See Lemas Mitchell's Amazon review for a list of reality checks). But that's not really the point; it's more of a coming-of-age story about an adolescent trying to find his place in the world. What I liked most is the film's message about the importance of kindness; Craig is truly a kind person who feels for other people, and the other patients and staff for the most part echo that kindness and caring. Another highlight is Zach Galifianakis's creative and quirky direction, especially the scenes when Craig retreats into his active fantasy world as he sings, draws, and reminisces.

1322890,A3KDVSFMPMXSRO,B0034G4OZE,Kevin F. Tasker,"[2, 4]","Directing team Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden burst onto the indie scene a couple years ago with the incredibly dreary but amazingly disarming Half-Nelson, in which a basehead Ryan Gosling showed himself as an actor of incredible, incredible talent, allowing more jaded moviegoers to forgive him for The Notebook. Now, some four or five years later, they have given the same opportunity to Zack Galifinakis, allowing him to stretch his acting chops in the shoes of a mental patient. While the result is not quite as heart-rending as Half-Nelson, It's Kind of A Funny Story is enjoyable in a different way. It is a light, entertaining coming of age story with a brisk pace and good message. Sometimes that is all a film needs.  With such morbid offerings in Hollywood these days (Black Swan, Let me In, Winter's Bone, et al), it is nice to find a film that nurtures its characters, allows them a chance to branch out, but provides them with *spoiler* a reasonably happy ending.The film is about a teen who finds himself somewhat suicidal with a family who are well-meaning but don't quite have enough time for him so he checks himself into a mental hospital and befriends both an older patient and a troubled girl his own age. Zack G. shines in the mentor role. Unlike the Hangover, he doesn't feel like he is just using random bits from his stand-up routine. His character is rounded and believable. The main kid does a great job. His eyes are dark and full of the sort of angst that most teens come to hate at times, feeling lost and that life is a pointless exercise. The girl is also believable as an indie chick with some pain up her sleeve, even if the cause of her trouble is never fully explained.The film is a far far lighter endeavor than both Girl, Interrupted or Milos Forman's classic One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. There are a lot of scenes of positive reinforcement and dealing with issues in a constructive manner. One meltdown aside, the film portrays its subjects as virtually across-the-board endearing, perhaps a little too much so. Gone are the shuffling catatonics of Cuckoo's Nest (Men David Foster Wallace might call ""crocodiles""). Absent are the eerie-eyed beauties of Girl, Interrupted who have sacrificed everything and will continue catapulting toward the abyss until a heavy shot in the arm silences them. Fleck and Boden's film is different. Perhaps it speaks to the way the mental treatment business has undergone some long-awaited improvements in the past few decades. Perhaps it is only wearing rosy-tinted glasses.Regardless, the film remains respectful of those with mental disorders, reiterating for perhaps not so savvy audience members that diseases of the brain are nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed by. Dealing with this stigma is laudable and so is showing problems as conquerable- and not in a Nurse Ratchet manner. Hope is a precious commodity in Hollywood these days. If it comes in a David Bowie dance number or clandestine jaunts through the hospital in promoted scrubs, so be it. There is room for a life lesson or two that avoid saccharine by a few steps and a love story that is so cleverly self-referencial to avoid running aground on cliche.For anyone looking an accompaniment to Renton's ""choose life"" speech at the end of Trainspotting (albiet a lot lighter), this film will satisfy. It will leave you feeling good. Released. Sometimes that is all a movie needs to do to be memorable. To make you feel worthy, human and very much alive.",4,Pitch-perfect coming of age tale that doesn't take itself too seriously despite the subject matter,1298246400,"02 21, 2011",2011,3488,"['Directing', 'team', 'Ryan', 'Fleck', 'Anna', 'Boden', 'burst', 'indie', 'scene', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'incredibly', 'dreary', 'amazingly', 'disarming', 'Half-Nelson', 'basehead', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'showed', 'actor', 'incredible', 'incredible', 'talent', 'allowing', 'more', 'jaded', 'moviegoers', 'forgive', 'Notebook', 'Now', 'four', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'have', 'given', 'same', 'opportunity', 'Zack', 'Galifinakis', 'allowing', 'stretch', 'acting', 'chops', 'shoes', 'mental', 'patient', 'result', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'heart-rending', 'Half-Nelson', 'Kind', 'A', 'Funny', 'Story', 'enjoyable', 'different', 'way', 'light', 'entertaining', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'brisk', 'pace', 'good', 'message', 'film', 'needs', 'such', 'morbid', 'offerings', 'Hollywood', 'days', 'Black', 'Swan', 'Let', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'et', 'al', 'nice', 'find', 'film', 'characters', 'chance', 'branch', 'out', 'reasonably', 'happy', 'ending.The', 'film', 'teen', 'who', 'somewhat', 'family', 'who', 'are', 'well-meaning', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'enough', 'time', 'so', 'mental', 'hospital', 'older', 'patient', 'troubled', 'girl', 'own', 'age', 'Zack', 'G.', 'shines', 'mentor', 'role', 'Hangover', ""n't"", 'feel', 'just', 'using', 'random', 'bits', 'stand-up', 'routine', 'character', 'rounded', 'believable', 'main', 'kid', 'great', 'job', 'eyes', 'are', 'dark', 'full', 'sort', 'angst', 'most', 'teens', 'come', 'hate', 'times', 'feeling', 'lost', 'life', 'pointless', 'exercise', 'girl', 'also', 'believable', 'indie', 'chick', 'pain', 'up', 'sleeve', 'even', 'cause', 'trouble', 'never', 'fully', 'explained.The', 'film', 'far', 'far', 'lighter', 'endeavor', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'classic', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'are', 'lot', 'scenes', 'positive', 'reinforcement', 'dealing', 'issues', 'constructive', 'manner', 'One', 'meltdown', 'aside', 'film', 'subjects', 'virtually', 'across-the-board', 'endearing', 'perhaps', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'Gone', 'are', 'shuffling', 'catatonics', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'Men', 'David', 'Foster', 'Wallace', 'might', 'call', 'crocodiles', 'Absent', 'are', 'eerie-eyed', 'beauties', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'who', 'have', 'sacrificed', 'everything', 'will', 'continue', 'catapulting', 'abyss', 'heavy', 'shot', 'arm', 'Fleck', 'Boden', 'film', 'different', 'Perhaps', 'way', 'mental', 'treatment', 'business', 'undergone', 'long-awaited', 'improvements', 'past', 'few', 'decades', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'wearing', 'rosy-tinted', 'glasses.Regardless', 'film', 'respectful', 'mental', 'disorders', 'reiterating', 'perhaps', 'not', 'so', 'savvy', 'audience', 'members', 'diseases', 'brain', 'are', 'nothing', 'be', 'ashamed', 'embarrassed', 'Dealing', 'stigma', 'laudable', 'so', 'showing', 'problems', 'conquerable-', 'not', 'Nurse', 'Ratchet', 'manner', 'Hope', 'precious', 'commodity', 'Hollywood', 'days', 'David', 'Bowie', 'dance', 'number', 'clandestine', 'jaunts', 'hospital', 'promoted', 'scrubs', 'so', 'be', 'room', 'life', 'lesson', 'two', 'avoid', 'saccharine', 'few', 'steps', 'love', 'story', 'so', 'cleverly', 'self-referencial', 'avoid', 'running', 'aground', 'cliche.For', 'anyone', 'looking', 'accompaniment', 'Renton', 'choose', 'life', 'speech', 'end', 'Trainspotting', 'albiet', 'lot', 'lighter', 'film', 'will', 'satisfy', 'will', 'leave', 'feeling', 'good', 'Released', 'movie', 'do', 'be', 'memorable', 'make', 'feel', 'worthy', 'human', 'very', 'much', 'alive']",N/A

Mental wards are *locked* facilities. You can't just ""sneak out,"" because every single door is locked.2. Psychiatrists don't sit and listen to patients talk about their fears/dreams/ hopes/ childhood. They want to know what are the symptoms of the patient so that they can medicate him and get him out to make room for the next patient.3. Psychiatrists DON'T act like the doctor in this movie, because the relationship is not meant to be a friendship. It is meant to be a therapeutic relationship, and so any single thing that might offer insight into the personality of a psychiatrist is something that s/he will scrupulously avoid revealing in any way.4. Visiting hours in psych wards are limited. People can't just randomly walk in off the street at any time of day.5. There are no parties in psych wards, nor are people allowed to just call in a pizza delivery from a ward.6. People do not stay there until they can get their lives sorted out. They stay there until they are stabilized (and sometimes not even that long). If it were any different, you wouldn't see so many bums (with obvious mental problems) on the street.7. You need to put coins in the phone to use it anywhere in the world.8. Doctors or nurses will NEVER discuss the personal details of one patient with another patient. (If a patient asks a doctor ""What's wrong with that guy?"" the doctor will never just come out with ""Oh, he's scizophrenic""-- even if the patient in question is frankly crazy/ schizophrenic.)Short Attention Span Summary:1. A young (if melodramatic) boy decides that he is having some sort of existential crisis.2. He checks himself into a hospital, and finds that his problems are actually much less severe than those of most of the other inhabitants.3. The protagonist finds not one but two women. (It seems that he had to go to the psych ward to become a pimp.)4. Almost everything is (predictably) wrapped up by the end of the 5th day (the way that it should be in a good little bildungsroman).This movie did have a few funny/ witty moments, and my overall impression of it could have been better it didn't cause me so much cognitive dissonance by presenting so many false impressions of psych wards.",2,Bildungsroman in a mental hospital?,1296777600,"02 4, 2011",2011,2375,"['get', 'synopsizing', 'film', 'let', 'point', 'out', 'things', 'were', 'COMPLETELY', 'FALSE', 'respect', 'mental', 'hospitals', 'were', 'shown', 'film', 'true', '.1', 'Mental', 'wards', 'are', '*locked*', 'facilities', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'sneak', 'out', 'single', 'door', 'locked.2', 'Psychiatrists', 'do', ""n't"", 'sit', 'listen', 'patients', 'talk', 'fears/dreams/', 'hopes/', 'childhood', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'symptoms', 'patient', 'so', 'can', 'medicate', 'get', 'out', 'make', 'room', 'next', 'patient.3', 'Psychiatrists', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'act', 'doctor', 'movie', 'relationship', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'friendship', 'meant', 'be', 'therapeutic', 'relationship', 'so', 'single', 'thing', 'might', 'offer', 'insight', 'personality', 'psychiatrist', 'something', 's/he', 'will', 'scrupulously', 'avoid', 'revealing', 'way.4', 'Visiting', 'hours', 'psych', 'wards', 'are', 'limited', 'People', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'randomly', 'walk', 'street', 'time', 'day.5', 'are', 'parties', 'psych', 'wards', 'are', 'people', 'allowed', 'just', 'call', 'pizza', 'delivery', 'ward.6', 'People', 'do', 'not', 'stay', 'there', 'can', 'get', 'lives', 'sorted', 'out', 'stay', 'there', 'are', 'stabilized', 'sometimes', 'not', 'even', 'long', 'were', 'different', 'would', ""n't"", 'see', 'so', 'many', 'bums', 'obvious', 'mental', 'problems', 'street.7', 'need', 'put', 'coins', 'phone', 'use', 'anywhere', 'world.8', 'Doctors', 'nurses', 'will', 'NEVER', 'discuss', 'personal', 'details', 'one', 'patient', 'patient', 'patient', 'doctor', 'What', 'wrong', 'guy', 'doctor', 'will', 'never', 'just', 'come', 'out', 'Oh', 'scizophrenic', 'even', 'patient', 'question', 'frankly', 'crazy/', 'schizophrenic', 'Short', 'Attention', 'Span', 'Summary:1', 'young', 'melodramatic', 'boy', 'having', 'sort', 'existential', 'crisis.2', 'hospital', 'problems', 'are', 'actually', 'much', 'less', 'severe', 'most', 'other', 'inhabitants.3', 'protagonist', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'women', 'had', 'go', 'psych', 'ward', 'become', 'pimp.', '4', 'Almost', 'everything', 'predictably', 'wrapped', 'up', 'end', '5th', 'day', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'good', 'little', 'bildungsroman', '.This', 'movie', 'did', 'have', 'few', 'funny/', 'witty', 'moments', 'overall', 'impression', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'cause', 'so', 'much', 'cognitive', 'dissonance', 'presenting', 'so', 'many', 'false', 'impressions', 'psych', 'wards']",N/A

Zach Galifianakis is great in his support role; he really ties the whole story together as the wise character Bobby who seems to know everything about the people and inner workings of their unit. This ""all-knowing"" quality is the only characteristic that at times seems a bit inauthentic in the character. However, his personal story as a father struggling to overcome suicidal ideation is a refreshing change from the roles we usually see from Galifianakis. Keir Gilchrist delivers a fantastic performance as Craig, a teen trying to deal with all sorts of pressures from family, friends, and himself. The number of cutaway fantasy gags give the viewer a glimpse into his psyche and are usually hilarious and something most people can relate to.

Sherwin,"[1, 1]","It's Kind of a Funny Story is a well-made film that takes a somewhat lighthearted look at teen depression, frustration and angst; the filmmakers probably wanted to keep things amusing at times so that the subject matter would not turn off the audience. The plot moves along quite well; and the cinematography and choreography reflect great forethought. The acting is very convincing; the musical score is quite good and Craig's rock and roll star ""dream sequence"" also enhances the film.When the action starts, we meet Craig (Keir Gilchrist), a teenager fraught with frustration and depression mostly about keeping up with the other students in a school for the gifted; and it doesn't help matters that the girl Craig has his eyes on, Nia (Zo Kravitz), is dating his best friend Aaron (Thomas Mann) for whom everything comes easy in life. Not only is Aaron able to score with the girl Craig is interested in, Aaron even has a 4.6 average! Craig is also under intense pressure to attend a prestigious summer school and give up his chance to have at least a little fun in his life. Unfortunately for Craig, this is all too much; he becomes quite depressed and contemplates suicide more and more. After almost killing himself, Craig checks himself into a hospital for depression and suicidal thoughts naively thinking he can be released the very next day because he has school and can't miss it!However, Craig can't be released all that quickly--hospital policy--and things take an interesting turn when Craig is told that the teen ward is being renovated and he must stay on an adult psychiatric ward. Craig naturally meets all types of patients: there is Bobby (Zach Galifianakis), a man with a daughter; a schizophrenic patient named Jimmy (Lou Myers); Craig's roommate Muqtada (Bernard White); Humble (Matthew Maher); Johnny (Adrian Martinez), Noelle (Emma Roberts) an attractive young teenager who cuts herself and more! While Craig gets therapy, he is attracted to Noelle and wants to get to know her better. Craig also develops a friendship with Bobby and their conversations form a good deal of the backbone of the plot. Of course, how everything plays out is the focus of the rest of the film.Look for more excellent performances by Viola Davis as Dr. Eden Minerva; Lauren Graham and Jim Gaffigan as Craig's parents Lynn and George; Dana DeVestern as Alyssa, Craig's younger sister; Ethan Herschenfeld as an ""acid head;"" Jeremy Davies as Smitty who works on the psych ward and Aasif Mandvi as Dr. Mahmoud.The DVD comes with some nice extras: there are deleted scenes and outtakes.

El-Hewie""","[8, 13]","Watch Zach Galifianakis' performance in the movies Hangover and Dinner for Schmucks gave me heartache with his fake acting and exaggerated effort to invoke laughter. Additionally, the previews of this movie did not help in rehabilitating Galifianakis' image. Yet, in this movie, Galifianakis performed exceptionally well. With a story founded on realistic scenario, every actor became a star. Galifianakis' curse was avoided by his serious reaction, getting angry, and snapping when things required a reasonable person to do so.The movie's success stems from presenting parallels of psychiatric behaviors that could easily illuminate the underlying elements of mental illness.The 16-year-old Craig, with no prior exposure to real life stressors, walked into the emergency room seeking immediate relief from his depression.  After begging to get admitted, Craig realized immediately the limitation of the medical profession in catering to his perceived and emergent needs. He must stay in the custody of the psychiatric ward for a minimum of five days before he could regain his freedom. Overcoming the stigma of psychiatric incarceration took incremental successive steps until Craig was able to fit in and tolerate the judgment of the outside world on his condition.The movie lasted through the entire five days of Craig's hospitalization and his revolutionary influence on both the inpatients and the outsiders. Starting from Bobby(Galifianakis), Craig was able to share, give and take experience with Bobby who sounded saner than what he perceived himself to be. In his immediate neighborhood, Craig unveiled the bright side of the Egyptian patient, Muqtadda and got him to get out of his seclusion and dance on the hospital floor, on the Egyptian music.Better yet, Craig left the hospital with a a sweat heart Noel who appeared to have been written in his book as his destiny, love, and strife for calm. Craig triumphed over obsession with his friend's girl friend after getting beaten up by Muqtadda for using the latter's bed to make love.The story was not just funny, but a real life lesson on how to gain perspectives in dealing with life conflicts and staying sane. Within five days, Craig left the hospital with a clean bill of health and entire new look on the world. He started appreciating having a father who could buy and deliver pizza at his son's request to the mental hospital, lending a shirt to Bobby, and flashing eight dollars to the impoverished inpatients.Once outside the psychiatric ward, Craig needed no trickery or gimmicks to enjoy the liberty of getting outside, breathing fresh air, and enjoying the unlimited space without steel bars or security guards. Craig left the psychiatric ward with a sweat heart, many new friends, great appreciation for liberty,health, and happiness, and a pledge to volunteer to such great cause.",5,A breakthrough in the psychiatric ward.,1286668800,"10 10, 2010",2010,2856,"['Watch', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'performance', 'movies', 'Hangover', 'Dinner', 'Schmucks', 'gave', 'heartache', 'fake', 'acting', 'exaggerated', 'effort', 'invoke', 'laughter', 'Additionally', 'previews', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'rehabilitating', 'Galifianakis', 'image', 'movie', 'Galifianakis', 'performed', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'story', 'founded', 'realistic', 'scenario', 'actor', 'became', 'star', 'Galifianakis', 'curse', 'was', 'avoided', 'serious', 'reaction', 'getting', 'angry', 'snapping', 'when', 'things', 'required', 'reasonable', 'person', 'do', 'so.The', 'movie', 'success', 'presenting', 'parallels', 'psychiatric', 'behaviors', 'could', 'easily', 'illuminate', 'underlying', 'elements', 'mental', 'illness.The', '16-year-old', 'Craig', 'prior', 'exposure', 'real', 'life', 'stressors', 'walked', 'emergency', 'room', 'seeking', 'immediate', 'relief', 'depression', 'begging', 'get', 'admitted', 'Craig', 'realized', 'immediately', 'limitation', 'medical', 'profession', 'catering', 'perceived', 'emergent', 'needs', 'must', 'stay', 'custody', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'minimum', 'five', 'days', 'could', 'regain', 'freedom', 'Overcoming', 'stigma', 'psychiatric', 'incarceration', 'took', 'incremental', 'successive', 'steps', 'Craig', 'was', 'able', 'fit', 'tolerate', 'judgment', 'outside', 'world', 'condition.The', 'movie', 'lasted', 'entire', 'five', 'days', 'Craig', 'hospitalization', 'revolutionary', 'influence', 'inpatients', 'outsiders', 'Starting', 'Bobby', 'Galifianakis', 'Craig', 'was', 'able', 'share', 'give', 'take', 'experience', 'Bobby', 'who', 'sounded', 'saner', 'what', 'perceived', 'be', 'immediate', 'neighborhood', 'Craig', 'unveiled', 'bright', 'side', 'Egyptian', 'patient', 'Muqtadda', 'got', 'get', 'seclusion', 'dance', 'hospital', 'floor', 'Egyptian', 'music.Better', 'yet', 'Craig', 'left', 'hospital', 'sweat', 'heart', 'Noel', 'who', 'appeared', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'book', 'destiny', 'love', 'strife', 'calm', 'Craig', 'triumphed', 'obsession', 'friend', 'girl', 'friend', 'getting', 'beaten', 'up', 'Muqtadda', 'using', 'latter', 'bed', 'make', 'love.The', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'funny', 'real', 'life', 'lesson', 'how', 'gain', 'perspectives', 'dealing', 'life', 'conflicts', 'staying', 'sane', 'five', 'days', 'Craig', 'left', 'hospital', 'clean', 'bill', 'health', 'entire', 'new', 'look', 'world', 'started', 'appreciating', 'having', 'father', 'who', 'could', 'buy', 'deliver', 'pizza', 'son', 'request', 'mental', 'hospital', 'lending', 'shirt', 'Bobby', 'flashing', 'eight', 'dollars', 'impoverished', 'inpatients.Once', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'Craig', 'needed', 'trickery', 'gimmicks', 'enjoy', 'liberty', 'getting', 'outside', 'breathing', 'fresh', 'air', 'enjoying', 'unlimited', 'space', 'steel', 'bars', 'security', 'guards', 'Craig', 'left', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'sweat', 'heart', 'many', 'new', 'friends', 'great', 'appreciation', 'liberty', 'health', 'happiness', 'pledge', 'volunteer', 'such', 'great', 'cause']",N/A

I watched it on a whim during a boring overnight shift and expected it to be something to make fun of later.It's difficult to describe just how badly it was advertised. This movie is not a laugh out loud comedy though it is very funny in some parts. At points it's very serious and very sad but it makes this all the more realistic considering it's plot line. This is probably the first and only movie I've seen that actually has a realistic depiction of people with depression. Masterful acting all around gives you a perfect example as well as the outside parties who simply do not understand how depression works. Zach Galifianakis actually uses his acting abilities and plays one of his best roles he's ever been in.

1322916,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B0034G4OZE,Steve,"[1, 1]","It's Kind of a Funny Story is a charming, thoughtful, and slightly bittersweet look at teenage depression as well as the pressures of life for all of us and how we cope. The subject matter is well covered in scores of other artistic mediums, but that doesn't devalue this effort. IKOAFS is well written and acted, smoothly directed, and engagingly paced for a light drama.As I mentioned, the acting is superb, especially Zach Galifianakis and the young lead played by Keir Gilchrist. His shy mannerisms and geeky awkwardness are captivating and genuine, no doubt aiding by the fact that he is a teen himself. It's nice to see Galifianakis playing against his clueless stereotype and he handles the subtleties and suppressed self-loathing of his character without trying to steal scenes or chew scenery.Though it has nothing to do with the movie per se, I found myself reflecting upon a small moment in the movie when Gilchrist's ""Cool"" Craig is talking with the ward's chief therapist. She asks if he has anyone he can talk to about his problems and it struck me how essential that element is for all our sanity. As Craig learns, and as I have as well in my life, he isn't alone in struggling with depression. Maybe it's a casualty of our increasingly insulated life, stuck to our personal communication devices at the expense of our face-to-face interactions, or maybe I'm simply thinking too much. Be that as it may, in a society buried under countless options for staying perpetually connected with each other, it's amazing how easy it is for our social skills to atrophy or for our sense of reality to get blurred through the anonymity of these technological social venues. What are we losing in the convenience of avoiding depth?It would be easy to criticize the movie's ending but I took heart with it.

But, when all that stress becomes too much to handle, what do you do?Craig Gilner (played by Keir Gilchrist) is a sixteen year-old who's contemplated suicide many times. One night, he dreams of riding his bike to the Brooklyn Bridge. In the dream, before he can jump, his mother (played by Lauren Graham), father (played by Jim Gaffigan) and little sister appear on the bridge. After a brief conversation, Craig loses his balance and falls to the water below. He wakes up after that and heads to the nearest emergency room. The admitting nurse, who was on the phone at the time of Craig's arrival, hears him state that he intends to kill himself and simply hands him a clipboard with attached admitting forms. While sitting in the waiting area, a man in scrubs in a lab coat (played by Zach Galifianakis) strikes up a conversation and then leaves abruptly. When he is actually examined, his doctor (played by Aasif Mandvi) does not believe that Craig is a threat to himself but Craig is adamant and, as such, is admitted for evaluation. The part of the hospital usually reserved for mentally ill teens is undergoing renovations so Craig is placed with the adults. His roommate, a middle-aged Egyptian named Muqtada (played by Bernard White) rarely leaves his bed and has not left his room in weeks. The initial shock provokes feelings of ""buyer's remorse"" in Craig but the hospital staff is not permitted to release him without evaluating him, which will take several days. In that time he becomes acquainted with other patients such as fellow teen, Noelle (played by Emma Roberts) and the man he encountered in the waiting room, Bobby (Galifianakis) who regularly leaves the ward, without permission, dressed in scrubs to avoid being escorted back.I love this movie. Gilchrist masterfully portrays, in my opinion, a young adult grappling with issues that are far beyond his comprehension who is trying desperately to conceal that at the same time. Graham as the caring, over-emotional mother is someone we feel great sympathy for. Zach Galifianakis, for the first time in his acting career, scales back on the eccentricities we usually see in him and, surprisingly enough, shows talent as an actor. It seems odd that the least eccentric character that he's ever portrayed would be a mental patient, but that doesn't make it any less true. To sum up, It's Kind of a Funny Story is a near-brilliant film and I would advise anyone who found my review intriguing in the slightest to see it at their earliest possible convenience.",5,Galifianakis.
