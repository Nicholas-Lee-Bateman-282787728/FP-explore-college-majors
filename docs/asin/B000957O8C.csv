Completely agree with the previous reviews on how CBS screwed with it's momentum.The only thing I'd change is that by season 4 the show becomes just a little bit predictable.  Doug becomes dumber and hungrier with each episode and Carrie becomes angrier and bitchier.  I wish it was more like the first couple of seasons where Carrie would be really sweet some times and totally explode other times.  Kept you guessing.  By the time I got to season 4 you knew what was going to happen.  Doug was going to do something not so smart, and Carrie was going to Whip him into shape.  The only character that continues to be unpredictable in his antics is Artie.  You can see seasons one through 4 all in one shot and still not get tired of Jerry Stiller in this role.  The Deacon Character is great too.  Still a great show and will be getting season 5 when it finally comes out.",4,LOVE THIS SHOW!,1139788800,"02 13, 2006",2006,894,"['show', 'great', 'Completely', 'agree', 'previous', 'reviews', 'how', 'CBS', 'screwed', 'momentum.The', 'only', 'thing', ""'d"", 'change', 'season', '4', 'show', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'predictable', 'Doug', 'dumber', 'hungrier', 'episode', 'Carrie', 'angrier', 'bitchier', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'first', 'couple', 'seasons', 'where', 'Carrie', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'sweet', 'times', 'totally', 'explode', 'other', 'times', 'Kept', 'guessing', 'time', 'got', 'season', '4', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'Doug', 'was', 'going', 'do', 'something', 'not', 'so', 'smart', 'Carrie', 'was', 'going', 'Whip', 'shape', 'only', 'character', 'be', 'unpredictable', 'antics', 'Artie', 'can', 'see', 'seasons', 'one', '4', 'one', 'shot', 'still', 'not', 'get', 'tired', 'Jerry', 'Stiller', 'role', 'Deacon', 'Character', 'great', 'too', 'Still', 'great', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'getting', 'season', '5', 'when', 'finally', 'out']",The King of Queens: Season 4

901988,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B000957O8C,Tim Janson,"[30, 32]","King of Queens has been one of my favorite shows for some time and one of the very few good comedies on TV.  Problem is that CBS has just screwed with the time and date so much that it's made it lose momentum.  I see that CBS has now moved the show back to Monday nights where it started and where it ALWAYS should have been left.  This is one of those shows I love because they never take things too seriously.  Like other greats such as Seinfeld and Everybody Loves Raymond, I don't think we'll ever see a ""Very special episode of King of Queens"" that's played for drama.  NOTHING kills a comedy more than drama.  This a wonderful show with a fairly small, but crazy ensemble cast of characters.  Nicole Sullivan, fresh from Mad TV would become a semi-regular this season as a dog walker who walks Carrie's Dad Arthur!Here are the highlights of season Four""Walk man""  Holly (Sullivan) a dog walker is hired by Doug to occupy Arthur's time as she pretends to be interested in his boring war stories.""No Retreat"" Doug and Carrie are invited to her company's retreat for a weekend and Doug isn't happy about it.  Doug ends up lying to Carrie's boss when he claims to have climed Mt. Everest.""Tricker Treat""  A classic episode.  Arthur it seems has a phobia about Halloween decorations and forbids Doug to put them up.  Doug puts them up anyway and Arthur is so frightened by a paper ghost that he ends up in the hospital.  Hilarious!""Life Insurance""  As Doug and Carrie check out life insurance plans, Doug is terrified that he might have to take care of Arthur if Carrie dies first.  They install a camera so they can keep an eye on Arthur in the basement and Deacon and Spence have fun watching Arthur.""Food Fight""  Carrie is upset with Doug when he is infatuated by Spence's new girlfriend.  Turns out she's a chef and Doug is infatuated with her cooking.""Bun Dummy"" - Doug is anxious to show off his beautiful wife at his high school reunion but hates Carrie wearing her hair in a bun all the time and tries to make her change it.""Eddie Money""  Doug and Deacon win $5,000 gambling on a boxing match but Doug doesn't want to tell Carrie because he stole the $100 for the bet from their emergency money fund.Those are my favorites but there's really not any sour notes in this season.
