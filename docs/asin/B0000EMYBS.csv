781673,A1OZFMJ2AD2R41,B0000EMYBS,Furiae,"[49, 50]","First, let me get this off my chest: Finally, a Jewel concert on DVD!This is Jewel's first concert release on DVD.  I thought it was great-- no rapid cuts between cameras, no quirky sound issues, and the picture is crisp, clean, and clear.  Jewel is radiant, and I thought this recording did well to capture her sense of humor.For those who prefer pre-0304 before the makeover, this was performed well before 0304, so it's folkie-acoustic-Jewel.  Whether you like her recent transformation or not, this DVD boasts the same great voice her fans have come to know and love.Though some have complained about the sound, it's not an issue unless you're *really, really, really* a sound buff.  I popped it in the player and was able to enjoy it just fine with my TV speakers and the occasional stereo headphone (when I play it on the computer).About 3/4 of the songs are done solo, so fans of &quot;Jewel &amp; Guitar&quot; won't be disappointed.  The last four songs (You Were Meant For Me, Hands, Everybody Needs Someone Sometime, Who Will Save Your Soul) are performed with a band backing her up.  (She picks up the electric guitar in the 'Hands' performance.)Also included are 3 bonus performances of Love Me Just Leave Me Alone, Do You Want to Play, and Jesus Loves You.  There's also a Standing Still video, which is basically a montage of various behind the scenes and concert clips showing while the song is playing.  Then there's an interview with Jewel that's about 12 minutes long in which she talks about her creative process and the long break she took between before recording 'This Way.'Jewel's forte is live performances.  Though I wish there were more songs, I'll take what I can get.  I especially enjoyed her lively banter with her audience, and it was great fun to see her start off her concert with opera, off all things, a cappella.  I also liked Who Will Save Your Soul, which when performed live nowadays is nothing like what it was on the album.  It's become a jazzy number that serves her as a vehicle for improv, and improv she definitely does on this one!Just to set the record straight, I did some research on Jewel since some people have complained that the material is old (from 2001).  The new tour for the 0304 CD is currently underway in the US, so it's 1) impossible to get a concert DVD for the new tour, since it still hasn't wrapped up yet, which means 2) this DVD was probably released partly to help promote the 0304 tour.Sound quality I thought was fine.  Jewel's voice rang crystal clear.  Picture quality was terrific, clear, and sharp-- no fuzziness/blurriness like on Sarah McLachlan's Mirrorball DVD.  The editing wasn't distracting in the slightest, so no rapid-chops like on Sheryl Crow's C'mon America release.If you're a Jewel fan, definitely get this.  If you like the genre or if you loved Lillith Fair, this should be of interest to you.  However, if the thought of a girl and her guitar for an hour makes you sleepy just thinking about it, pass on this.  My take on this is that it isn't my all-time favorite concert, but it was worth the money and I'm definitely happy with this purchase.  I like the genre, I like Jewel, and this concert was 15 bucks decently spent.",5,i thought it was delightful,1083801600,"05 6, 2004",2004,3216,"['First', 'let', 'get', 'off', 'chest', 'Finally', 'Jewel', 'concert', 'DVD', 'Jewel', 'first', 'concert', 'release', 'DVD', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'rapid', 'cuts', 'cameras', 'quirky', 'sound', 'issues', 'picture', 'crisp', 'clean', 'clear', 'Jewel', 'radiant', 'thought', 'recording', 'did', 'well', 'capture', 'sense', 'humor.For', 'who', 'prefer', 'pre-0304', 'makeover', 'was', 'performed', 'well', '0304', 'folkie-acoustic-Jewel', 'recent', 'transformation', 'not', 'DVD', 'same', 'great', 'voice', 'fans', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'love.Though', 'have', 'complained', 'sound', 'not', 'issue', ""'re"", '*really', 'really', 'really*', 'sound', 'buff', 'popped', 'player', 'was', 'able', 'enjoy', 'just', 'fine', 'TV', 'speakers', 'occasional', 'stereo', 'headphone', 'when', 'play', 'computer', '3/4', 'songs', 'are', 'done', 'solo', 'so', 'fans', 'quot', 'Jewel', 'amp', 'Guitar', 'quot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'last', 'four', 'songs', 'Were', 'Meant', 'Me', 'Hands', 'Everybody', 'Needs', 'Someone', 'Sometime', 'Who', 'Will', 'Save', 'Your', 'Soul', 'are', 'performed', 'band', 'backing', 'up', 'up', 'electric', 'guitar', ""'Hands"", 'performance', 'Also', 'included', 'are', '3', 'bonus', 'performances', 'Love', 'Me', 'Just', 'Leave', 'Me', 'Alone', 'Do', 'Want', 'Play', 'Jesus', 'Loves', 'also', 'Standing', 'Still', 'video', 'basically', 'montage', 'various', 'scenes', 'concert', 'clips', 'showing', 'song', 'playing', 'Then', 'interview', 'Jewel', '12', 'minutes', 'long', 'creative', 'process', 'long', 'break', 'took', 'recording', ""'This"", 'Way', 'forte', 'live', 'performances', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'songs', ""'ll"", 'take', 'what', 'can', 'get', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'lively', 'banter', 'audience', 'was', 'great', 'fun', 'see', 'start', 'concert', 'opera', 'off', 'things', 'cappella', 'also', 'liked', 'Who', 'Will', 'Save', 'Your', 'Soul', 'when', 'performed', 'live', 'nowadays', 'nothing', 'what', 'was', 'album', 'become', 'jazzy', 'number', 'vehicle', 'improv', 'improv', 'definitely', 'one', 'Just', 'set', 'record', 'straight', 'did', 'research', 'Jewel', 'people', 'have', 'complained', 'material', 'old', '2001', 'new', 'tour', '0304', 'CD', 'currently', 'underway', 'US', '1', 'impossible', 'get', 'concert', 'DVD', 'new', 'tour', 'still', ""n't"", 'wrapped', 'up', 'yet', '2', 'DVD', 'was', 'probably', 'released', 'partly', 'help', 'promote', '0304', 'quality', 'thought', 'was', 'fine', 'Jewel', 'voice', 'rang', 'crystal', 'clear', 'Picture', 'quality', 'was', 'terrific', 'clear', 'sharp', 'fuzziness/blurriness', 'Sarah', 'McLachlan', 'Mirrorball', 'DVD', 'editing', 'was', ""n't"", 'distracting', 'slightest', 'rapid-chops', 'Sheryl', 'Crow', ""C'mon"", 'America', 'release.If', ""'re"", 'Jewel', 'fan', 'definitely', 'get', 'like', 'genre', 'loved', 'Lillith', 'Fair', 'should', 'be', 'interest', 'However', 'thought', 'girl', 'guitar', 'hour', 'sleepy', 'just', 'thinking', 'pass', 'take', ""n't"", 'all-time', 'favorite', 'concert', 'was', 'worth', 'money', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'happy', 'purchase', 'genre', 'like', 'Jewel', 'concert', 'was', '15', 'bucks', 'decently', 'spent']",N/A
781674,A3USRUCHAOC3MT,B0000EMYBS,"Indiana Jeff Reynolds ""Preacher Jeff""","[5, 8]","I've only heard a couple of Jewel songs before watching this tape.  I was very impressed with hearing her sing ""O Holy Night"".  I also heard ""Standing Still"" and ""You Were Meant For Me"" on the radio.For the most part, I really enjoyed this DVD.  I was impressed that most of the set was with just an acoustic guitar.  I also could tell more of an emphasis on the lyrics than a lot of other pop musicians.  I thought her audience participation early in the concert was unique and gutsy.  And I love Jewel's sound.Considering I'm a fundamentalist Christian minister, though, some of her songs made me very uncomfortable, especially ""Who Will Save Your Soul"" and ""Jesus Loves Me"".  It is possible that the lyrics are concerned with hypocritical Christians primarily, and if that is the main focus, I can't argue with her.  But if these lyrics are a mockery of Christianity, it is enough for me to consider myself a former Jewel fan.  And I hope it isn't mockery.I'm sure some people will say I wasn't helpful just because of what I said, but I trust readers really want to know how the reviewer sees it subjectively as well as objectively.Back to being objective, there is a video of her setting up live and signing autographs with ""Standing Still"" in the back ground.  I was disappointed that song was not part of the concert.In summary, if you like a female folk singer, you'll enjoy this project.  I do have some reservations, and it is because I'm trying to decide if Jewel is either someone who was burned by hypocrites, or if she paints all Christians as hypocrites and is basically at war with everything I believe.My favorite tracks were ""Per la Gloria d'Adorarvi"", ""Everything Breaks Sometimes"", ""Grey Matter"", ""Break Me"", and ""The New Wild West"".",4,"I Liked Most Of This DVD, But What I Didn't Like I REALLY Didn't Like",1182038400,"06 17, 2007",2007,1753,"[""'ve"", 'only', 'heard', 'couple', 'Jewel', 'songs', 'watching', 'tape', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'hearing', 'sing', 'O', 'Holy', 'Night', 'also', 'heard', 'Standing', 'Still', 'Were', 'Meant', 'Me', 'radio.For', 'most', 'part', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'was', 'impressed', 'most', 'set', 'was', 'just', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'also', 'could', 'tell', 'more', 'emphasis', 'lyrics', 'lot', 'other', 'pop', 'musicians', 'thought', 'audience', 'participation', 'early', 'concert', 'was', 'unique', 'gutsy', 'love', 'Jewel', 'sound.Considering', ""'m"", 'fundamentalist', 'Christian', 'minister', 'songs', 'made', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'especially', 'Who', 'Will', 'Save', 'Soul', 'Jesus', 'Me', 'possible', 'lyrics', 'are', 'concerned', 'hypocritical', 'Christians', 'primarily', 'main', 'focus', 'ca', ""n't"", 'argue', 'lyrics', 'are', 'mockery', 'Christianity', 'enough', 'consider', 'former', 'Jewel', 'fan', 'hope', ""n't"", 'mockery.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'people', 'will', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'helpful', 'just', 'what', 'said', 'trust', 'readers', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'reviewer', 'subjectively', 'as', 'well', 'objectively.Back', 'being', 'objective', 'video', 'setting', 'up', 'live', 'signing', 'autographs', 'Standing', 'Still', 'back', 'ground', 'was', 'disappointed', 'song', 'was', 'not', 'part', 'concert.In', 'summary', 'like', 'female', 'folk', 'singer', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'project', 'do', 'have', 'reservations', ""'m"", 'trying', 'decide', 'Jewel', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'burned', 'hypocrites', 'Christians', 'hypocrites', 'basically', 'war', 'everything', 'believe.My', 'favorite', 'tracks', 'were', 'Per', 'la', 'Gloria', ""d'Adorarvi"", 'Everything', 'Breaks', 'Sometimes', 'Grey', 'Matter', 'Break', 'Me', 'New', 'Wild', 'West']",N/A

781677,AOK72ELBI86GF,B0000EMYBS,Poker Face,"[1, 2]","A beautiful performance by a beautiful singer. Jewel shines in this short (about 57 minutes), but sweet concert performed in San Jose, California. There are also four bonus songs totalling about 14 minutes, an 11.5 minute interview, and a 4 minute picture gallery, thus equalling about 87 minutes in total running time. It's all in full screen, with no subtitle option. There are simple, but effective lighting effects that don't detract from her performance, as well as some nice fades and overlaying of images that help make repeated viewings more enjoyable and soothing. The interactive part of the Dvd, comes in the form of the Jukebox bonus feature, which lets you play any of the 17 songs (unfortunately, NOT any of the four bonus songs) in any order you like. You can even choose to play the same song, 17 times in a row, if you wanted to. It's fast loading and rather seemless. Other music Dvd's also have this wonderful feature, however, a greater percentage of them do not have it!I listened to the 2.0 channel stereo track and found it loud enough to enjoy (so many music Dvds are so weak in volume that they are almost useless). The four bonus songs are a little louder and thus closer to Cd quality, but it's all definitely good enough to recommend. My favorite performance is Jewel's acoustic version of ""Break Me"". I watched it so often that I even noticed a very quick digital (audio-only) hiccup, at about the 29:05 mark of the Dvd, during that song. It was on both my rental copy and the one that I bought from Amazon. It's too minor to generally notice, but I was listening so intently, that I noticed it. According to the ""This Way"" Cd (sold separately) liner notes, ""Break Me"" is a love song she wrote for her husband, Ty. One of the lines in the song, ""sharp end of what you say"", was from a Rickie Lee Jones song (Jewel asked her if she could use it).Some of the concert's song choices are a little questionable, as are some of the omissions (that's why I didn't give it 5 stars). For example, how can you leave out the song, ""This Way"", from the ""This Way"" tour concert?  How about, instead of playing the same concert version of ""Break Me"" during the four minute photo gallery, you instead play ""This Way"", ""Life Uncommon"", or even ""Enter From the East"". Note: The photo gallery is made up of eight photos that start off as closeups and then they slowly zoom out: 2 are in b+w, 2 are almost identical photos-like the Dvd cover, 1 nice face closeup, 1 side view of her in sexy pink dress, and 2 other okay poses. Plus, give us more pictures! The Dvd photo gallery from Tori Amos' ""Tales of a Librarian"" bonus Dvd had 48 pictures (though no zooming), also done in 4 minutes.After Jewel finishes singing the first song of the concert, she removes her jacket to reveal the trademark Jewel cleavage, and gets a few whistles. She jokingly says, ""Wooo...You dorks. Woo, she took her coat off. That's what I like to get applauded for"". Another highlight occurs when she calls a pretty blonde woman onstage, who's clearly enamoured with Jewel (watch how Jewel reacts when the woman moves behind her and touches Jewel's shoulders--funny stuff), to help her with the lyrics to ""Kiss the Flame"". She wasn't kidding. She really has trouble remembering her song lyrics. Again, from the liner notes of the ""This Way"" Cd, she admits that the false start in ""Sometimes It Be That Way"" (Live Cd version), was just her forgetting the lyrics--then, on the Cd, you hear a fan shout them out and she says, ""Thank you.""Also, in the ""Grey Matter"" song, there's a verse (taken from the lyrics that come with the actual ""This Way"" Cd) that goes, ""A scrape against silence, a knife across a plate."" However, in both the Cd and in her Dvd performance, she incorrectly sings, ""a knife AGAINST a plate."" Another verse is, ""You got gold dust in your pocket, you got moth holes in your soul."" But on the Cd live version, she incorrectly sings, ""You got MOTH HOLES in your pocket, you got moth holes in your soul."" However, on this Dvd, she sings it correctly.Although, sometimes she intentionally changes words or phrases to keep her live performances different from her Cd's, so that it's more entertaining and fun. For instance, in ""Sometimes It Be That Way"" (from her Live performance on the ""Live at Humphrey's..."" Dvd), she sings ""He said, SWEETHEART, I don't think you quite understand..."", whereas in her  Live performance on the ""This Way"" Cd, she sings: ""He said, JEWEL, I don't think you quite understand."" The CORRECT lyrics use the word ""JEWEL"" in the song, so she doesn't always alter the lyrics for every live performance of a song. However, in the Dvd version, she also switched some minor lyrics near the very end of the song, as well.She finally ends the concert with a soulful and somewhat sexy rendition (yeah, shake those hips Jewel), of ""Who Will Save Your Soul?"". I liked the occasional quick edits that were used here to match the beats of the song. She also doesn't play her guitar this time, so we finally get a good look at her partial bare belly. Might be a bit chunky, but I think the jeans are just a bit too tight, or perhaps I'm used to seeing too many starved women on Tv. You're still smokin' hot, Jewel, don't you worry.Of the four bonus songs, ""Standing Still"", although just a montage, is my favorite. The other three are shot with an often shaky hand-held camera, from a side or three-quarter view. They're rather dull, but at least in ""Jesus Loves You"" (3:19), Jewel is wearing a tight, low-cut, red blouse, that the camera man zooms in on. She does sing, ""Showing ta-tas on the tv is ok...I wanna be ok too."", so the camera man is just doing what she's singing about. Unfortunately, there is no 'Play All' option for these four songs.So, I really enjoyed this Dvd, but it should have been longer with a better song selection. You were meant for ME, Jewel.

She plays along nicely and the audience is amused to no end.At times she is sassy as she dances before singing, but she continually connects with the audience in a way I've rarely seen. There is an interesting change as she goes from playing and singing with her guitar, to playing with her band. There is a change from intimacy to a more professional formality. While I noticed this change, she still remains authentic throughout the performance.Extras: A short interview with Jewel and a photo gallery.Also recommended:A Night Without Armor : PoemsChasing Down the Dawn (More observations about our society...)~The Rebecca Review",5,A Heart on Display,1109980800,"03 5, 2005",2005,2127,"['Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'love', 'words', 'touch', 'much', 'too', 'deeply.They', 'make', 'core', 'tremble.Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'realize', 'effect', 'have', 'over', 'me.And', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'just', 'want', 'make', 'always.Jewel', 'music', 'poems', 'concerts', 'show', 'heart', 'display', 'first', 'concert', 'disc', 'overwhelming', 'feeling', 'intimacy', 'connection.So', 'break', 'meTake', 'meJust', 'let', 'meFeel', 'arms', 'againBreak', 'meMake', 'meJust', 'let', 'meFeel', 'love', 'againThe', 'intellectual', 'dances', 'child', 'Jewel', 'heart', 'world', 'touch', 'pulse', 'humanity', 'even', 'political', 'statements', 'show', 'intuitive', 'understanding', 'society.Welcome', 'new', 'wild', 'westEach', 'man', 'himselfA', 'nation', 'civilized', 'steeplesAnd', 'lonely', 'peopleWelcome', 'new', 'wild', 'west', 'New', 'Wild', 'West', 'stunning', 'content', 'contrast', 'love', 'songs', 'songs', 'had', 'tears', 'few', 'left', 'stunned', 'lyrics', 'were', 'potent', 'intellectually', 'pleasurable.Songs', 'Per', 'la', 'Gloria', ""d'AdorarviNear"", 'AlwaysKiss', 'FlameRosy', 'MickEverything', 'Breaks', 'Be', 'WayGrey', 'MatterBreak', 'MeThe', 'New', 'Wild', 'WestYou', 'Were', 'Meant', 'MeHandsEverybody', 'Needs', 'Someone', 'SometimeWho', 'Will', 'Save', 'Your', 'SoulBonus', 'Performances', 'Love', 'Me', 'Just', 'Leave', 'Me', 'AloneDo', 'Want', 'Play', 'Jesus', 'YouI', 'loved', 'part', 'where', 'girl', 'up', 'stage', 'whisper', 'words', 'amusing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'would', 'really', 'forget', 'words', 'along', 'nicely', 'audience', 'amused', 'end.At', 'times', 'sassy', 'singing', 'continually', 'audience', 'way', ""'ve"", 'rarely', 'seen', 'interesting', 'change', 'playing', 'singing', 'guitar', 'playing', 'band', 'change', 'intimacy', 'more', 'professional', 'formality', 'noticed', 'change', 'still', 'authentic', 'performance.Extras', 'short', 'interview', 'Jewel', 'photo', 'gallery.Also', 'recommended', 'Night', 'Without', 'Armor', 'PoemsChasing', 'Down', 'Dawn', 'More', 'observations', 'society', '~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A

Phillips ""StevieRae5""","[8, 10]","When I bought Jewel: A Life Uncommon, I was looking for great concert footage of Jewel and maybe a little insight into her personal life. However, I got little of either of those things. When I watched this DVD, however, I was absolutely thrilled.The DVD is nothing but Jewel in concert, which is her in top form--joking with the audience, singing gorgeously, and pulling people in with the beauty of her music and voice. Best of all, she avoids material from 0304 for the most part, concentrating on her older, folkier material, to which I hope she is making a swift return. One of the highlights, for me, was bringing a fan onstage to help her with the words to ""Kiss the Flame."" The best thing about Jewel is her ability to interact so wonderfully and intimately with the audience, and this DVD really demonstrated that talent. The bonus material includes an interview with Jewel, which is interesting, but the real reason to buy this DVD is the concert itself.If you ever get the chance to see Jewel in concert, you should do everything you can to take it. However, if you are unable to attend one of her live shows, this DVD is a great substitution. You will definitely NOT be disappointed.",5,This is so much more like it!!!,1116288000,"05 17, 2005",2005,1195,"['When', 'bought', 'Jewel', 'Life', 'Uncommon', 'was', 'looking', 'great', 'concert', 'footage', 'Jewel', 'maybe', 'little', 'insight', 'personal', 'life', 'However', 'got', 'little', 'things', 'When', 'watched', 'DVD', 'however', 'was', 'absolutely', 'thrilled.The', 'DVD', 'nothing', 'Jewel', 'concert', 'top', 'form', 'joking', 'audience', 'singing', 'gorgeously', 'pulling', 'people', 'beauty', 'music', 'voice', 'Best', 'material', '0304', 'most', 'part', 'concentrating', 'older', 'folkier', 'material', 'hope', 'making', 'swift', 'return', 'One', 'highlights', 'was', 'bringing', 'fan', 'onstage', 'help', 'words', 'Kiss', 'Flame', 'best', 'thing', 'Jewel', 'ability', 'interact', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'intimately', 'audience', 'DVD', 'really', 'demonstrated', 'talent', 'bonus', 'material', 'interview', 'Jewel', 'interesting', 'real', 'reason', 'buy', 'DVD', 'concert', 'itself.If', 'ever', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'Jewel', 'concert', 'should', 'do', 'everything', 'can', 'take', 'However', 'are', 'unable', 'attend', 'one', 'live', 'shows', 'DVD', 'great', 'substitution', 'will', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A
