745414,A2JOTVRQSHC7CH,B00008N72J,Elizabeth,"[6, 7]","I am a big fan of Shah Rukh Khan. And I love seeing him in his films. However, It was torture for me to watch this film. I completely disagreed with the interpretations in the story. I felt that Shah Rukh Khan's character was completely innocent in the circumstances presented in the film. His character should not have been blamed at all. He had legitimate reasons to feel jealous because his wife had placed a different relationship above the marriage partner! I felt that the character played by Madhuri Dixit was the one to be blamed for the difficulties. She should have focused more on her husband, nurturing that relationship, and giving her marriage relationship the highest priority. It was perplexing for me to watch Madhuri Dixit's character and Salman Khan's character obliviously continue a strong friendship with each other even though Madhuri had married Shah Rukh Khan's character. The whole concept of ""putting yourself in someone else's shoes"" never occured to either of them. If they were treated the way they were treating Shah Rukh Khan's character, that would be a wake up call to them.",1,Don't agree with script,1335312000,"04 25, 2012",2012,1108,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'Khan', 'love', 'seeing', 'films', 'However', 'was', 'torture', 'watch', 'film', 'completely', 'disagreed', 'interpretations', 'story', 'felt', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'Khan', 'character', 'was', 'completely', 'innocent', 'circumstances', 'presented', 'film', 'character', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'blamed', 'had', 'legitimate', 'reasons', 'feel', 'jealous', 'wife', 'had', 'placed', 'different', 'relationship', 'marriage', 'partner', 'felt', 'character', 'played', 'Madhuri', 'Dixit', 'was', 'one', 'be', 'blamed', 'difficulties', 'should', 'have', 'focused', 'more', 'husband', 'nurturing', 'relationship', 'giving', 'marriage', 'relationship', 'highest', 'priority', 'was', 'perplexing', 'watch', 'Madhuri', 'Dixit', 'character', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'character', 'obliviously', 'continue', 'strong', 'friendship', 'other', 'even', 'Madhuri', 'had', 'married', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'Khan', 'character', 'whole', 'concept', 'putting', 'someone', 'else', 'shoes', 'never', 'occured', 'were', 'treated', 'way', 'were', 'treating', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'Khan', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'wake', 'up', 'call']",Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam

His imagination and suspicious nature get carried away and it's shown in the movie in a comical way although the story itself is relatively serious in most of its content. It has a happy ending. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and especially the lead actor's portrayal of his character. I recommend the movie to everyone.The DVD was sent to me in very good condition. Everything works as it should.

745417,A2PVZJY7E6454H,B00008N72J,"Lyn ""Lyn""","[7, 7]","This is about a triangle of husband (Shah Rukh Khan) and wife (Madhuri Dixit) and the male friend she's been close to since childhood (Salman Khan). It is also about that couple and their challenges adjusting to the marriage. She doesn't put the couple first and get to know her husband: being still focused on her brother, old friend and household duties. Husband also doesn't get to know wife or make any attempt to make her brother and friend important to him too. Husband tried to reach to wife to deepen the romantic connection but she isn't there for him. He becomes more and more needy and that twists to anger and jealousy at her friendship with the old friend. He then overreacts.The script did have something a little lacking or not enough melodrama was pulled from it, but it did go a bit slower than many others with these stars. However the stars are such that their presence and (mostly) their acting made it worth watching. They had looked at couple dynamics a bit differently too.I did find Madhuri and Shahrukh had little chemistry and were acting to the audience rather than each other - but then the plot is about them not really connecting properly so perhaps they were doing that. Shahrukh did overdo one scene in particular when he was meant to be drunk. I have seen him do drunk better (e.g. Devdas) and found this less than his usual performance.Surprisingly it was Salman who didn't go over the top and he was quite good and even subtle a few times. Another reviewer found Salman needy but I didn't (even though I have had that complaint about some other Salman performances). There is also a cameo from Aishwarya Rey Bachchan).The musical numbers were big ones and the music fine but mostly unmemorable. The look of the costumes still drifted more to a 1980 and 1990s look (in 2002) at times yet there some more modern ones coming in mostly on the males. SRK and Madhuri really didn't get a chance to strut their stuff but Salman (as a top singer) does quite a bit and did it well.It's not the greatest of Bollywood but a bit above average and the actors make it worth the journey. Elsewhere on the Net it tends to get an average or a bit above.

745421,AOUFNKPTMAIHO,B00008N72J,vent,"[4, 4]","PLOTUnconventional for India love triangle. This is the story of a woman who doesn't know how to say no to the people in her life except when it comes to her husband than it's no this and no that. I need to go to do something now . My brother needs me . My best friend (male) needs me . If any woman who watches this film doesn't start shaking her head at the female lead she's not naive she's lying to herself.  There is not a woman on this planet that wouldn't  put her foot down if her husband started spending his every waking moment lavishing attention on a female friend or relative to the exclusion of the marriage partner. This reverse triangle and at times quadrangle because of the emotional and financial leach of a brother of hers, is more about family dynamics and what do we as a couple owe to our partner, ourselves and our relationships. This is a really good film with some soap opera style drama and excellent acting by SRK and Mrs. Dixit.Salman's character while not sympathetic to most people must of been hard to play as the friend from childhood who doesn't have romantic feelings for his friend who is a woman. His ability to portray this type of character is pretty good despite the difficulty of getting the performance perfect of the male who is so wrapped up in his self that his  friend is losing her marriage because of him and her attitude towards her husband. Look for a extended cameo from Aishwarya Rai  as his blind girlfriend.I think this movie also strikes a family chord as well because there is always that person in every family that over indulges lavish attention on one person and makes the rest of the family feel invisible and not good enough. The constant what do I have to do to get some attention around here feeling is very well portrayed by SRK and he does a smash up job as the husband who finally starts to go nuts while all around him have the gall to look surprised.
