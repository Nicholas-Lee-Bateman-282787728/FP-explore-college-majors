1505959,A1W9JOFE6F89FB,B00600SMV8,Amber MacDonald,"[5, 5]","I did not know what to expect when I popped this movie into my player. Admittedly, none of my friends or family have seen or even heard of it, which is weird, considering it's a sequel. Such is usually the case with straight to DVD movies. There is generally a smaller budget than big ticket films, meaning less advertisement, among other omissions. This is definitely one of those movies. This is not a bad thing, as it seems to work for this movie.Though the movie was not in the commercial spotlight, it did feature Dolph lundgren. Everyone who enjoys Dolph's style will be pleased with this film, as it displays a character that is closer to his personality, I think, than any other role he has previously taken. He made me laugh more than once with his clever quips.If you like fantasy movies, action movies, or any movie with a compelling story, this film should find a home in your collection, and fit in nicely. I love the adventure, and the unbelievable twists that make a fantasy a true fantasy. I love the dragon, which was rendered skillfully and looked very real.As much as I want to tell you exactly what happens, I won't. I am recommending this movie for anyone, it is appropriate for your teenagers as well.

1505961,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00600SMV8,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 3]","Two minutes and sixteen seconds. That is exactly how long it took me to realize that ""In the Name of the King 2: Two Worlds"" was going to be an epic suckfest.Specifically, that was when a Xena-style sorceress eluded a pair of Robin Hood ninjas, and ran right into the street of a modern city. In his ongoing quest to make my brain melt, Uwe Boll has churned out yet another ghastly sequel to one of his horrid movies, dragging a perpetually befuddled-looking Dolph Lundgren back into Ye Olde Renfaire surroundings.Grizzled veteran Granger (Dolph Lundgren) is pulled through a vortex by a mysterious sorceress, who then dies after proclaiming that he's part of some prophecy. He finds himself centuries in the past, where hooded assassins are trying to kill him. King Raven (Lochlyn Munro) tells him that he's the destined Chosen One of a prophecy who is the only one who can kill the Dark Mother (Christina Jastrzembska) and stop the Dark Ones, blah blah. It's all very generic.So he's sent out on a mission with a bunch of soldiers and a sexy lady doctor named (I kid you not) Manhatten (Natassia Malthe). Does she have sisters named Brooklyn and Harlem? Anyway, Granger and the soldiers fight the Dark Ones on their way to where the Dark Mother is, but soon Granger discovers the truth about the Dark Mother and King Raven -- meaning he must now fulfill the prophecy in a different way.""In the Name of the King 2: Two Worlds"" is a lazy, LAZY movie. Everything about it is halfhearted -- the acting, the plotting, the backstory, and even the fricking prophecy that the whole plot revolves around. Even worse, there's a MASSIVE plot twist that completely invalidates most of of the stuff that happens in the first half of the story, and leaves vast gaping plot holes behind it.The entire movie has a grimy, dirty air, as if Boll rented a long-abandoned RenFaire ground for the setting, and both the Dark Ones and King Raven seem to have armies consisting of about two dozen guys. The scripting is absolutely abysmal, made even funnier by Natassia Malthe's hilariously stilted, breathless delivery (""It was an honor to fight beside you and lie with you as your woman!"").And I honestly believe that Dolph Lundgren was drunk during the production of this movie. And I cannot blame him. He puts no visible effort into any kind of acting. And at the beginning of every scene, he has this slightly befuddled expression, as if he's thinking, ""Aw man, I'm still in this turkey? I need another drink.""Sadly, Lundgren himself is the best thing about his character, who is 150% Gary Stu. He's a Special Forces supersoldier who is also the chosen one, has a secret past, and has a prophecy revolving around him; soldiers who initially hate him randomly become his biggest fans, and women who have exchanged two sentences with him want to have awkward sex with him.Oh, and the ending? Copout. I assume that Boll's RenFaire lease expired, because he never really shows us what happens to the Dark Ones... and instead we get a lame, strangely abrupt one-on-one battle.I thought fantasy couldn't get more hackneyed than the first movie, but ""In the Name of the King 2: Two Worlds"" proves that you can always make a bad fantasy series cheaper, dirtier and more halfhearted.",1,In the name of Dolph Lundgren (spoilers),1329868800,"02 22, 2012",2012,3256,"['Two', 'minutes', 'sixteen', 'seconds', 'exactly', 'how', 'long', 'took', 'realize', 'Name', 'King', '2', 'Two', 'Worlds', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'epic', 'suckfest.Specifically', 'was', 'when', 'Xena-style', 'sorceress', 'eluded', 'pair', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'ninjas', 'ran', 'right', 'street', 'modern', 'city', 'ongoing', 'quest', 'make', 'brain', 'melt', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'churned', 'out', 'yet', 'ghastly', 'sequel', 'one', 'horrid', 'movies', 'dragging', 'perpetually', 'befuddled-looking', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'back', 'Ye', 'Olde', 'Renfaire', 'surroundings.Grizzled', 'veteran', 'Granger', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'pulled', 'vortex', 'mysterious', 'sorceress', 'who', 'then', 'proclaiming', 'part', 'prophecy', 'centuries', 'past', 'where', 'hooded', 'assassins', 'are', 'trying', 'kill', 'King', 'Raven', 'Lochlyn', 'Munro', 'destined', 'Chosen', 'One', 'prophecy', 'who', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'kill', 'Dark', 'Mother', 'Christina', 'Jastrzembska', 'stop', 'Dark', 'Ones', 'blah', 'blah', 'very', 'sent', 'out', 'mission', 'bunch', 'soldiers', 'sexy', 'lady', 'doctor', 'named', 'kid', 'not', 'Manhatten', 'Natassia', 'Malthe', 'have', 'sisters', 'named', 'Brooklyn', 'Harlem', 'Anyway', 'Granger', 'soldiers', 'fight', 'Dark', 'Ones', 'way', 'where', 'Dark', 'Mother', 'soon', 'Granger', 'truth', 'Dark', 'Mother', 'King', 'Raven', 'meaning', 'must', 'now', 'fulfill', 'prophecy', 'different', 'way', 'Name', 'King', '2', 'Two', 'Worlds', 'lazy', 'LAZY', 'movie', 'Everything', 'halfhearted', 'acting', 'plotting', 'backstory', 'even', 'fricking', 'prophecy', 'whole', 'plot', 'revolves', 'Even', 'worse', 'MASSIVE', 'plot', 'twist', 'completely', 'most', 'stuff', 'first', 'half', 'story', 'vast', 'gaping', 'plot', 'holes', 'it.The', 'entire', 'movie', 'grimy', 'dirty', 'air', 'Boll', 'rented', 'long-abandoned', 'RenFaire', 'ground', 'setting', 'Dark', 'Ones', 'King', 'Raven', 'seem', 'have', 'armies', 'consisting', 'about', 'two', 'dozen', 'guys', 'scripting', 'absolutely', 'abysmal', 'made', 'even', 'funnier', 'Natassia', 'Malthe', 'hilariously', 'stilted', 'breathless', 'delivery', 'was', 'honor', 'fight', 'lie', 'woman', '.And', 'honestly', 'believe', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'was', 'drunk', 'production', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'blame', 'visible', 'effort', 'kind', 'acting', 'beginning', 'scene', 'slightly', 'befuddled', 'expression', 'thinking', 'Aw', 'man', ""'m"", 'still', 'turkey', 'need', 'drink', 'Sadly', 'Lundgren', 'best', 'thing', 'character', 'who', '150', '%', 'Gary', 'Stu', 'Special', 'Forces', 'supersoldier', 'who', 'also', 'chosen', 'one', 'secret', 'past', 'prophecy', 'revolving', 'soldiers', 'who', 'initially', 'hate', 'randomly', 'become', 'biggest', 'fans', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'exchanged', 'two', 'sentences', 'want', 'have', 'awkward', 'sex', 'him.Oh', 'ending', 'Copout', 'assume', 'Boll', 'RenFaire', 'lease', 'expired', 'never', 'really', 'what', 'Dark', 'Ones', 'instead', 'get', 'lame', 'strangely', 'abrupt', 'one-on-one', 'battle.I', 'thought', 'fantasy', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'hackneyed', 'first', 'movie', 'Name', 'King', '2', 'Two', 'Worlds', 'can', 'always', 'make', 'bad', 'fantasy', 'series', 'cheaper', 'dirtier', 'more', 'halfhearted']",N/A

Actors stuck in a rut playing the same typecast roles (look at their film biblios if in doubt) ad nauseam and audiences that need the comfortable predictability of stereotypes. Lundgren as ex-war hero now martial arts instructor as our cheap intro to start the movie. Acting was stilted, bland, read a line, cut and edit tedious.(2.) The totally uncreative use of, and most of the budget spent on, costumes that look like every other similar movie ever made - lots of black hooded and caped wardrobes with the usual painted faces. Check out the King's wardrobe -  costume jewelry crown with big metal dangling things on his cape.(3.) Dialogue, ""Aye, my Lord!"" and similar Middle Ages make-believe language probably first coined in a '30s Robin Hood movie and has persisted ever since in filmdom. Mixed with the usual stereotype fantasy phrasing, ""The dark one at the enchanted place."" ""Time beyond."" and ""We live in a time of powerful sorcery."" - ughhh. Finally add contemporary dialogue e.g. our middle ages sorceress/shifter kills three assassins and says ""You've been bested."",(4.) Props, the usual 21st century cosmetics for the ladies and a really small fortress that looks like it was designed by the Gingerbread man. The usual highly bejeweled swords/daggers; usual candles (even 21st century large diameter candles) and torches lit even in daylight - must have a good discount supplier.(5.) CGI of a blue whirlpool in air that is a time portal and, of course, a dragon with just a couple of flaps of it's wings somehow defies gravity and flies like a hawk.

Probably more than anything else, Dolph Lundgren is the reason I bought this film before seeing it. Dolph's performance does not disappoint. He's always been a larger than life presence on screen, and this film is no exception. He's also smart enough to not take the material too seriously and, therefore, have a good time with it. His smart-aleck delivery of many of his lines is right on and often very funny, intentionally so.The second reason I was curious about this film is because of the director, Uwe Boll. Uwe's career is much maligned, that's no secret. But, Uwe's films have a lot more going for them than people give them credit for. First of all, is Boll's uncanny ability to assemble some of most interesting casts that I've ever seen put together. He hasn't just done this once; he does it consistently. Secondly, Boll's films are always well photographed. They always look great, and there are often some surprisingly beautiful shots of natural scenery. Thirdly, his films often have very good musical scores. In the Name of the King 1 and 2 are perfect examples of the quality of material that Boll's composers deliver. Lastly, no matter the budget, Boll always seems to set out to make big movies. This enthusiasm is evident in all of the films of his I've seen.That being said, In the Name of the King 2 is not a film that you can necessarily enjoy with a straight face. You have to be willing to understand that this is a film that is meant to be taken light-heartedly and simply enjoyed for laughs both intentional and unintentional. If you're in the kind of demographic that enjoys cheesy Direct to DVD action/adventure films than you'll probably love this.

1505973,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B00600SMV8,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 1]","Dolph Lundgren and Uwe Boll - two names I never expected (or wanted) to see together. For the life of me, I'll never know what urged the Swedish Superman to make a film with the Good Doctor so soon after his reentry into the mainstream viaThe Expendables, but I suppose I ought to be grateful that while the movie is garbage, at least it's inoffensive and easily-forgettable garbage. As far as Boll goes, it's not nearly his worst, but perhaps the best thing ""Two Worlds"" here does is make us aware of how good of a movie the originalIn the Name of the Kingactually was.The story: an ex-Special Forces soldier (Lundgren) is thrown back in time to fulfill a twisted prophecy that will save the devastated former kingdom.I'll admit, I kind of liked the first ""Dungeon Siege"" movie: the visuals were creative, and the extensive cast was always entertaining. Both of these aspects are lost on the sequel, which goes to show what a budgetary difference of over $50 million can make. Most of the film has a bleak, contained wintertime look that's further offset by shaky handheld camerawork and only occasionally interrupted with naturally pretty forest imagery. The film's final 15 minutes feature a CGI-animated dragon fit for any SyFy production. Succinctly, it's all very boring to look at. Many folks criticized the former movie's ostentatious casting, but I think most would prefer that to the situation here, wherein the only casting qualifications must have been fitting the character's costume. Every single character is just so bland and the acting is roundly poor. Lochlyn Munro (White Chicks) is particularly awful as the king, and he's closely tailed by NatassiaBloodRayneMalthe as the eventual love interest. Replacing his fellow ""Expendable"" Jason Statham, Lundgren really doesn't seem into his role and it doesn't help that he spends the entire movie wearing jeans and a scarf; I was looking forward to seeing him in armor like on the Canadian DVD cover. The only performer giving a decent performance is Christina Jastrzembska (New Moon) as the ancient Holy Mother.One of my qualms with the original film was the complete lack of suspense and obviousness of characters' intentions. ""Two Worlds"" builds favorably on this with a bit of slightly less predictable double-crossing and role reversals, but more than once the writing strays into convoluted territory when revealing plot points. This leaves us with only the action scenes to fall back on, but even here the film stumbles. Though the movie establishes Lundgren as a karate instructor, the martial arts in the movie are dull and poorly-shot. Weapons-fighting is the name of the game here, but that too is uninteresting at best and Dolph doesn't even touch a sword until the last stretch of film. The ""epic"" forest battle from the first movie is recreated on a micro scale (seriously, there are only sixteen people in this fight), replacing the Krug soldiers with hood-wearing humans (""dark ones"") but retaining the claustrophobic shooting style. The one-on-one finale is a gritty Steven Seagal-esque encounter, with no question whatsoever whether or not Dolph is going to win.As far as the dialogue goes, Lundgren's character literally puts Natassia Malthe's to sleep by talking about cheese. That about sums up the rest of the show.For a man who's openly distanced himself from big-budget movies, Uwe Boll really didn't utilize the freedom afforded to him by the direct-to-video genre here, choosing to do very little for his second sword & sorcery production. ""Two Worlds"" is a boring movie, and while many of the director's films have been severely flawed, they at least kept your attention with their slip-ups. This one doesn't really commit any blunders but I almost wish it would - at least I'd have more fun watching it.",2,"""We both agree this is a little awkward, right?""",1327276800,"01 23, 2012",2012,3795,"['Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'two', 'names', 'never', 'expected', 'wanted', 'see', 'together', 'life', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'what', 'urged', 'Swedish', 'Superman', 'make', 'film', 'Good', 'Doctor', 'so', 'soon', 'reentry', 'mainstream', 'viaThe', 'Expendables', 'suppose', 'ought', 'be', 'grateful', 'movie', 'garbage', 'least', 'inoffensive', 'easily-forgettable', 'garbage', 'As', 'far', 'Boll', 'not', 'nearly', 'worst', 'perhaps', 'best', 'thing', 'Two', 'Worlds', 'here', 'make', 'aware', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'originalIn', 'Name', 'Kingactually', 'was.The', 'story', 'ex-Special', 'Forces', 'soldier', 'Lundgren', 'thrown', 'back', 'time', 'fulfill', 'twisted', 'prophecy', 'will', 'save', 'devastated', 'former', 'kingdom.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'kind', 'liked', 'first', 'Dungeon', 'Siege', 'movie', 'visuals', 'were', 'creative', 'extensive', 'cast', 'was', 'always', 'entertaining', 'aspects', 'are', 'lost', 'sequel', 'show', 'what', 'budgetary', 'difference', '50', 'million', 'can', 'make', 'Most', 'film', 'bleak', 'contained', 'wintertime', 'look', 'further', 'offset', 'shaky', 'handheld', 'camerawork', 'only', 'occasionally', 'interrupted', 'naturally', 'pretty', 'forest', 'imagery', 'film', 'final', '15', 'minutes', 'feature', 'CGI-animated', 'dragon', 'fit', 'SyFy', 'production', 'Succinctly', 'very', 'boring', 'look', 'Many', 'folks', 'criticized', 'former', 'movie', 'ostentatious', 'casting', 'think', 'most', 'would', 'prefer', 'situation', 'here', 'wherein', 'only', 'casting', 'qualifications', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'fitting', 'character', 'costume', 'single', 'character', 'just', 'so', 'bland', 'acting', 'roundly', 'poor', 'Lochlyn', 'Munro', 'White', 'Chicks', 'particularly', 'awful', 'king', 'closely', 'tailed', 'NatassiaBloodRayneMalthe', 'eventual', 'love', 'interest', 'Replacing', 'fellow', 'Expendable', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'Lundgren', 'really', ""n't"", 'seem', 'role', ""n't"", 'help', 'entire', 'movie', 'wearing', 'jeans', 'scarf', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'armor', 'Canadian', 'DVD', 'cover', 'only', 'performer', 'giving', 'decent', 'performance', 'Christina', 'Jastrzembska', 'New', 'Moon', 'ancient', 'Holy', 'Mother.One', 'qualms', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'complete', 'lack', 'suspense', 'obviousness', 'characters', 'intentions', 'Two', 'Worlds', 'favorably', 'bit', 'slightly', 'less', 'predictable', 'double-crossing', 'role', 'reversals', 'more', 'once', 'writing', 'convoluted', 'territory', 'when', 'revealing', 'plot', 'points', 'only', 'action', 'scenes', 'fall', 'back', 'even', 'here', 'film', 'stumbles', 'movie', 'Lundgren', 'karate', 'instructor', 'martial', 'arts', 'movie', 'are', 'dull', 'poorly-shot', 'Weapons-fighting', 'name', 'game', 'here', 'too', 'uninteresting', 'best', 'Dolph', ""n't"", 'even', 'touch', 'sword', 'last', 'stretch', 'film', 'epic', 'forest', 'battle', 'first', 'movie', 'recreated', 'micro', 'scale', 'seriously', 'are', 'only', 'sixteen', 'people', 'fight', 'replacing', 'Krug', 'soldiers', 'hood-wearing', 'humans', 'dark', 'ones', 'retaining', 'claustrophobic', 'shooting', 'style', 'one-on-one', 'finale', 'gritty', 'Steven', 'Seagal-esque', 'encounter', 'question', 'whatsoever', 'not', 'Dolph', 'going', 'win.As', 'far', 'dialogue', 'Lundgren', 'character', 'literally', 'Natassia', 'Malthe', 'sleep', 'talking', 'cheese', 'sums', 'rest', 'show.For', 'man', 'who', 'openly', 'distanced', 'big-budget', 'movies', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'utilize', 'freedom', 'afforded', 'direct-to-video', 'genre', 'here', 'choosing', 'do', 'very', 'little', 'second', 'sword', 'sorcery', 'production', 'Two', 'Worlds', 'boring', 'movie', 'many', 'director', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'severely', 'flawed', 'least', 'kept', 'attention', 'slip-ups', 'one', ""n't"", 'really', 'commit', 'blunders', 'almost', 'wish', 'would', 'least', ""'d"", 'have', 'more', 'fun', 'watching']",N/A

actor in Freddy vs Jason and as Drago Musevni in an ep of Andromeda),and many other good supporting players.Director Boll uses Vancouver and its environs for his shooting location(good old Vancouver has been a pretty big hot spot for movie making in recent times).The plot involves Lundgren who is an ex forces man who runs a karate school for poor children.At home that evening he is attacked by men in black robes,and gets a shot off into one of them.He is rescued and taken back in time by a seer.She is killed and Lundgren is taken to the encampment of the King.The King tells him he is the Chosen One and wants him to slay the evil Holy Mother who apparently led the attack on him in the future.Off Lundgren sets and along the way he and his party get attacked.At one point one of the hooded individuals has Lundgren at knife point but hesitates,and he gets away.Lundgren is interrogating another,trying to get intel,when one the Kings men stabs the man to death.Something is not right,and Lundgren suspects there is a spy in the group.Lundgren eventually is forced to go the trip solo and does so,walking right into the camp of the Holy Mother,unmolested.He walks into her tent and talks with her.It seems the story he knows,is false.It is the King who has usurped the throne from the previous one,and Lundgren is the ex Kings long lost son,who was put into the future by her,years before.The King now intends to go into the future and poison that world,as he is an accomplished alchemist.And it was her who personally went back to save Lundgren but got shot.She is slowly dying and tells Lundgren he must reclaim his title.Lundgren leads a party to a dark forest,and in the forest is the Catalyst.The Holy Mother's daughter is there,but even she does not know what the Catalyst is.All anyone knows is that the chosen one must seek and retrieve it.Before he enters the forest,he bestows his crown onto her.In the forest Lundgren soon runs into the Catalyst;a giant Dragon.The Dragon flies about and  attacks the Kings fortress and lays waste to it.The King appears,opens a portal and goes back to the future,and Lundgren follows.A fight of course ensues in Lundgrens home,and eventually he is the victor.Lundgren settles back,knowing he has done all he can.This is a nicely paced film and Lundgren does a fine job as the ex military man out of water,spouting modern colloquialisms to the Medieval crowd.The action is well paced and the CGI dragon is not too bad a creation.If you saw the first movie with Statham,this one has absolutely NOTHING to do with that one whatsoever.This one doesn't have that scope or budget,for that matter.Boll is the only director I think I ever heard complain about having too much money for a film budget,as he did on the first one.I guess he had to put the blame for the disappointing reception and BO take he had on the first somewhere;but on its' budget?.....c'mon.I think there were plenty if indie directors who would have wished that he had created a personal slush fund,to hand out to them.They would have killed to have just 1/60th the budget he did.Oh well.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a featurette,,commentary,the trailer and a writer interview.All in all a good movie for the franchise.It is NOT a sequel per se from the
