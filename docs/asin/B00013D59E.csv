The story reminds me of Pacific Heights in that he's not the kind you would expect to be so scary and dangerous (as Michael Keaton was in Pacific Heights).

792052,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00013D59E,Michael Butts,"[0, 0]","UNDER PRESSURE is a tense, disturbing film, dominated not by star Charlie Sheen's over the top performance as the demented fireman, but by the down to earth, touching performance by Mare Winningham.  Mare portrays the mother of a family that is almost picture perfect; David Andrews plays her adoring husband, and she has two cute if persnickety kids.  However, next door neighbor Charlie Sheen seems to have fallen apart since his heroic life-saving.  His wife and son have left him, he's on probation from his job, and his wife has put a restraining order on him.  Naturally, this leads him to resent the couple next door, and soon Charlie's a bloodthirsty killer.  He tortures an unsuspecting refrigerator repairman, and ultimately does in a couple of cops before the final showdown with Mare and Andrews.This could have been a much better film, had we at least understood what Sheen was like before his heroic deed.  We also find out he let the baby's mother die in the fire because he was judgmental enough to condemn her having a child in a crackhouse.Okay, so without that, we still have a good, solid movie, thanks mainly to Miss Winningham.",4,PRESSURE COOKER,1082505600,"04 21, 2004",2004,1149,"['UNDER', 'PRESSURE', 'tense', 'disturbing', 'film', 'dominated', 'not', 'star', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'top', 'performance', 'demented', 'fireman', 'down', 'earth', 'touching', 'performance', 'Mare', 'Winningham', 'Mare', 'mother', 'family', 'almost', 'picture', 'perfect', 'David', 'Andrews', 'adoring', 'husband', 'two', 'cute', 'persnickety', 'kids', 'However', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'have', 'fallen', 'apart', 'heroic', 'life-saving', 'wife', 'son', 'have', 'left', 'probation', 'job', 'wife', 'put', 'restraining', 'order', 'Naturally', 'resent', 'couple', 'next', 'door', 'soon', 'Charlie', 'bloodthirsty', 'killer', 'unsuspecting', 'refrigerator', 'repairman', 'ultimately', 'couple', 'cops', 'final', 'showdown', 'Mare', 'Andrews.This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'had', 'least', 'understood', 'what', 'Sheen', 'was', 'heroic', 'deed', 'also', 'find', 'out', 'let', 'baby', 'mother', 'die', 'fire', 'was', 'judgmental', 'enough', 'condemn', 'having', 'child', 'crackhouse.Okay', 'so', 'still', 'have', 'good', 'solid', 'movie', 'thanks', 'mainly', 'Miss', 'Winningham']",N/A
