Things have gotten a little confusing with everyone trying to screw almost everyone else over but working towards the same goals, main characters being terminated and the general slight disaray and escewed perception of stories.  With the last episode of series three returning almost to early premise of the show.  It clearly shows the difference in writing from Gene to others with too much intregue.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[13, 13]","The four seasons of Earth: Final Conflict (with the exception of the execrable so-called fifth season) were flawed but intriguing, with a mesmerizingly likable alien race and a sometimes peculiar cast of hackers, freedom fighters, corporate bigwigs and cold FBI agents. The third season is, if not the best, then certainly the best-balanced.The season reopens with Lili Marquette taken captive by Ronald Sandoval, and sent to a mystery destination for reasons she doesn't know. On Earth, the Resistance is being roundly trounced; Liam and Augur are saved by a mystery woman -- who then turns out to be somehow connected with both the Taelons and the Resistance. One member of the Resistance will be lost, and a new, hard-edged Taelon arrives on the scene.Like all four seasons (that count) of EFC, the third season started off on wobbly footing and steadied as time went on. Some amazingly memorable episodes are here, coupled with some of the most intriguing scripts that allowed us new insights into the Taelons. Several characters are better fleshed-out here; &quot;Thicker Than Blood&quot; in particular is amazing, in which an enraged Liam (Robert Leeshock) and anguished Augur (Richard Chevolleau) are thrown through the fire, and Liam has to face that he's Sandoval's son. There's even a Taelon-baby cult, and a pair of new recurring Taelon faces: The hard-as-nails T'than, sworn enemy of Zo'or, and the snotty healer Mit'gai.Da'an (Leni Parker) and Liam go through some tough times after Da'an does something Liam never thought he would, yet helps his protector with the bioengineered Skrill Queen. But the one who really shines is Anita La Selva as Zo'or. Here we see that Zo'or is not the spoiled child emperor he sometimes seems like -- he's young, frustrated by the limitations the Commonality puts on him, frightened of the uncertain future, and his fear makes him ruthless because he doesn't know any other way to make things happen. In this season, he hits Taelon puberty, gets into a bar brawl (in a human body), hides in a basement with a pair of human teens, and has a heart-to-heart with Liam when they're stranded in the wilderness.Some of the episodes are a bit on the silly side (the rubber skrill-puppet, for example), but when the third season is good, it's very good. Certainly it's worth getting and appreciating.",4,Flawed but interesting,1058486400,"07 18, 2003",2003,2339,"['four', 'seasons', 'Earth', 'Final', 'Conflict', 'exception', 'execrable', 'so-called', 'fifth', 'season', 'were', 'flawed', 'intriguing', 'mesmerizingly', 'likable', 'alien', 'race', 'sometimes', 'peculiar', 'cast', 'hackers', 'freedom', 'fighters', 'corporate', 'bigwigs', 'cold', 'FBI', 'agents', 'third', 'season', 'not', 'best', 'then', 'certainly', 'best-balanced.The', 'season', 'Lili', 'Marquette', 'taken', 'captive', 'Ronald', 'Sandoval', 'sent', 'mystery', 'destination', 'reasons', ""n't"", 'know', 'Earth', 'Resistance', 'being', 'roundly', 'trounced', 'Liam', 'Augur', 'are', 'saved', 'mystery', 'woman', 'who', 'then', 'out', 'be', 'somehow', 'connected', 'Taelons', 'Resistance', 'One', 'member', 'Resistance', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'new', 'hard-edged', 'Taelon', 'scene.Like', 'four', 'seasons', 'count', 'EFC', 'third', 'season', 'started', 'off', 'wobbly', 'footing', 'steadied', 'time', 'went', 'amazingly', 'memorable', 'episodes', 'are', 'here', 'coupled', 'most', 'intriguing', 'scripts', 'allowed', 'new', 'insights', 'Taelons', 'Several', 'characters', 'are', 'better', 'fleshed-out', 'here', 'quot', 'Thicker', 'Than', 'Blood', 'quot', 'particular', 'amazing', 'enraged', 'Liam', 'Robert', 'Leeshock', 'anguished', 'Augur', 'Richard', 'Chevolleau', 'are', 'thrown', 'fire', 'Liam', 'face', 'Sandoval', 'son', 'even', 'Taelon-baby', 'cult', 'pair', 'new', 'recurring', 'Taelon', 'hard-as-nails', ""T'than"", 'sworn', 'enemy', ""Zo'or"", 'snotty', 'healer', ""Mit'gai.Da'an"", 'Leni', 'Parker', 'Liam', 'go', 'tough', 'times', ""Da'an"", 'something', 'Liam', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'yet', 'protector', 'bioengineered', 'Skrill', 'Queen', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'Anita', 'La', 'Selva', ""Zo'or"", 'Here', 'see', ""Zo'or"", 'not', 'spoiled', 'child', 'emperor', 'sometimes', 'young', 'frustrated', 'limitations', 'Commonality', 'frightened', 'uncertain', 'future', 'fear', 'ruthless', ""n't"", 'know', 'other', 'way', 'make', 'things', 'happen', 'season', 'Taelon', 'puberty', 'bar', 'brawl', 'human', 'body', 'basement', 'pair', 'human', 'teens', 'heart-to-heart', 'Liam', 'when', ""'re"", 'stranded', 'wilderness.Some', 'episodes', 'are', 'bit', 'silly', 'side', 'rubber', 'skrill-puppet', 'example', 'when', 'third', 'season', 'good', 'very', 'good', 'Certainly', 'worth', 'getting', 'appreciating']",N/A
761374,A1ESB50QBN4KT8,B0000A2ZPI,Jean-Luc,"[18, 23]","This is Season 3 for those of you that don't know. The last two seasons (4 and 5) are available as well. However seasons 1 and 2 have yet to be released.MY REVIEW:I've finished the entire season, and wow. Brilliant sci-fi, simply brilliant. The music/soundtrack of the show is awesome. It's just so good. Plus the shows are all in beautiful animorphic widescreen, making them better than ever. Widescreen always adds a movie-like element to shows, which is quite intoxicating to be sure. The special effects are marvelous. This show is just great fun.Personally I think the best seasons were Seasons 2, 3 and 4, what I like to call ""The Liam Years"". Liam is a great character, and an improvement on season one's Boone. Season 1 was of lower production quality as well. More money was put into later seasons. Plus these are the years with Zo'or, a spectacularly entertaining villain. He's the guy you love to hate. Sandoval is funny to watch because he clearly has trouble with english. Plus he's shorter than Liam making scenes with them together particularly amusing, especially when Sandoval is trying to exert his authority over him. I remember loving this show when it was on, and it was the character of Liam that drew me in. He's always looking around for spies in every one of his scenes, especially outdoor ones, which is hilarious. The character of Renee was introduced in the first episode of this set (Season 3). She's not who I would have cast for the part, she's just not quite right, but at least she's bearable (unlike the entire cast of Stargate SG1...ugh). Season 4 was another great season, however Season 5 was NOT. The wonderful characters you grew to love over the years, including Liam, Zo'or, and Da'an are gone. Renee is left to carry the show on her own, and well, it didn't take. In fact it was terrible. I will go so far to say that Season 5 was terrible. Just stick with Seasons 2 (when it comes out), 3 and 4, and pretend 5 never happened. (Season 1 was o.k., but Zo'or and Liam aren't in it yet, and they're great.)As mentioned by another reviewer, there is no Closed-Captioning/Subtitles. A useful tool for trying to decifer unclear dialogue. Why would this be left out?Also, there are no advanced menu screens on these discs, just the episodes basically. That is, no Scene Selection screens, no Sound Option screens, no nothing, just choose an episode and play it. But the chapters are placed nicely, including just after the opening theme (which is always convenient). However unlike most shows, the opening theme portion of EFC is done so well I want to watch it each time.And I would have liked to see COMMENTARIES recorded for some shows, but no dice. At least there are some extras on the last disc though.Another interesting thing to note is that a ""Dolby Surround WHERE AVAILABLE"" logo pops on the screen at the beginning of every episode just as it did on TV. This is clearly a mistake, something that wasn't removed. This, along with the above leads me to believe these sets were RUSHED into production. Rushed or not though, the picture and sound are top notch and that's what matters.Great show. A well-earned 5 stars.",5,Gene Roddenberry does it again,1092528000,"08 15, 2004",2004,3161,"['Season', '3', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', '4', '5', 'are', 'available', 'well', 'However', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'have', 'yet', 'be', 'released.MY', 'REVIEW', ""'ve"", 'finished', 'entire', 'season', 'wow', 'Brilliant', 'sci-fi', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'music/soundtrack', 'show', 'awesome', 'just', 'so', 'good', 'shows', 'are', 'beautiful', 'animorphic', 'widescreen', 'making', 'better', 'ever', 'Widescreen', 'always', 'movie-like', 'element', 'shows', 'quite', 'intoxicating', 'be', 'sure', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'marvelous', 'show', 'just', 'great', 'fun.Personally', 'think', 'best', 'seasons', 'were', 'Seasons', '2', '3', '4', 'what', 'like', 'call', 'Liam', 'Years', 'Liam', 'great', 'character', 'improvement', 'season', 'one', 'Boone', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'lower', 'production', 'quality', 'as', 'well', 'More', 'money', 'was', 'put', 'later', 'seasons', 'are', 'years', ""Zo'or"", 'spectacularly', 'entertaining', 'villain', 'guy', 'love', 'hate', 'Sandoval', 'funny', 'watch', 'clearly', 'trouble', 'english', 'shorter', 'Liam', 'making', 'scenes', 'together', 'particularly', 'amusing', 'especially', 'when', 'Sandoval', 'trying', 'exert', 'authority', 'remember', 'loving', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'was', 'character', 'Liam', 'drew', 'always', 'looking', 'spies', 'one', 'scenes', 'especially', 'outdoor', 'ones', 'hilarious', 'character', 'Renee', 'was', 'introduced', 'first', 'episode', 'set', 'Season', '3', 'not', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'cast', 'part', 'just', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'least', 'bearable', 'entire', 'cast', 'Stargate', 'SG1', 'ugh', 'Season', '4', 'was', 'great', 'season', 'however', 'Season', '5', 'was', 'NOT', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'grew', 'love', 'years', 'including', 'Liam', ""Zo'or"", ""Da'an"", 'are', 'gone', 'Renee', 'left', 'carry', 'show', 'own', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'fact', 'was', 'terrible', 'will', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'Season', '5', 'was', 'terrible', 'Just', 'stick', 'Seasons', '2', 'when', 'out', '3', '4', 'pretend', '5', 'never', 'happened', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'o.k.', ""Zo'or"", 'Liam', 'are', ""n't"", 'yet', ""'re"", 'great', 'mentioned', 'reviewer', 'Closed-Captioning/Subtitles', 'useful', 'tool', 'trying', 'decifer', 'unclear', 'dialogue', 'Why', 'would', 'be', 'left', 'out', 'Also', 'are', 'advanced', 'menu', 'screens', 'discs', 'just', 'episodes', 'basically', 'Scene', 'Selection', 'screens', 'Sound', 'Option', 'screens', 'nothing', 'just', 'choose', 'episode', 'play', 'chapters', 'are', 'placed', 'nicely', 'including', 'just', 'opening', 'theme', 'always', 'convenient', 'However', 'most', 'shows', 'opening', 'theme', 'portion', 'EFC', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'want', 'watch', 'time.And', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'COMMENTARIES', 'recorded', 'shows', 'dice', 'least', 'are', 'extras', 'last', 'disc', 'though.Another', 'interesting', 'thing', 'note', 'Dolby', 'Surround', 'WHERE', 'AVAILABLE', 'logo', 'pops', 'screen', 'beginning', 'episode', 'just', 'did', 'TV', 'clearly', 'mistake', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", 'removed', 'above', 'believe', 'sets', 'were', 'RUSHED', 'production', 'Rushed', 'not', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'what', 'matters.Great', 'show', 'well-earned', '5', 'stars']",N/A

761378,A3D7P8Q4SC1617,B0000A2ZPI,shadowdoc,"[14, 15]","Unfortunately, I never watched ""Earth: Final Conflict"" while it was  being actively produced.  With that in mind and the fact that the first and second season are still unavailable on DVD, I had a little bit of difficulty figuring out what was going on when first watching this third season DVD.  With just two seasons already accomplished, the show had developed considerable backstory and several rich characters.  The series takes place on Earth in the not-so-distant future after a race of aliens called the Taelons arrive with the promise of peace and cooperation.  The Taelons are not as altruistic as they seem, and hide ulterior motives for contacting humanity.  The central protagonists belong to an underground resistance seeking to expose the true agenda of the Taelons, which could reveal important information about the past and future evolution of the human race.Season 3 (""No Refuge"") continues the calamatous events of the second season cliffhanger finale in the episode ""Crackdown"".  A series regular, marine captain Lili Marquette (Lisa Howard) departs to be replaced by the savvy corporate executive Rene Palmer (Jayne Heitmeyer).  Liam Kincaid (Robert Leeshock) continues as the series' central protagonist with the Taelon leader Zo'or (Anita La Silva) and FBI special agent Ronald Sandoval (Von Flores) countering as the series' two deliciously evil villains.  Leni Parker, David Hemblen and Richard Chevorellaeu also contribute as the enigmatic Da'an, corporate raider Jonathan Doors, and computer genius Augur, respectively.  One of these three will also make a tragic exit toward the conclusion of the season (or did he truly die, see season 4).I have read fans of the show criticizing the third season for wandering aimlessly among several different developing plots with no real sense of direction.  Having viewed the third, fourth, and fifth seasons in their entirety, I do agree that this season lacked a certain coherence and fluidity with plotlines.  However, several key events happened in these semi-standalone episodes that are crucial to following the show's continuing story to its ultimate conclusion in season 5.  There are several memorable episodes this season, many of which ironically pertain to the fate of departed Lili Marquette (""Crackdown"", ""The Vanished"", ""In Memory"", and ""The Arrival"").  There are also a few episodes with less than engaging stories.Certainly, one of the most interesting aspects of this season is the delineation of the complicated relationships between different members of the Taelon race, particularly those between Da'an and Zo'or and between Zo'or and T'Than.  Additionally, with the introduction of Rene Palmer, we see more of the inner workings, secrets, and conflicts within Jonathan Doors' corporate empire.As for the DVD's themselves, the episodes were tranferred well and are beautiful to watch.  This DVD set is the only one of the three seasons released thus far to have actual interviews with cast members in the extras section on the final disk.I highly recommend purchasing this DVD set as well as the sets for the following fourth and fifth seasons.  This was an excellent TV show, a worthy addition to the Roddenberry legacy!
