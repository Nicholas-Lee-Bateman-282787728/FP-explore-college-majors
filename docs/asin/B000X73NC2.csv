This movie is based on the short stories in The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing by Melissa Bank. This further increased my interest, as I've seen the book, but never picked it up. (The movie has nothing to do with actual hunting or fishing, FYI.) Gellar is Brett Eisenberg, an editor, trying to work her way up at a NY publishing company, who meets Archie Knox (Alec Baldwin), a much older veteran of the publishing world. Romance ensues and real life tragedies interrupt, making both take watch of their lives. The funniest part about this movie was my boyfriend walking in and wondering who matched up Baldwin as Gellar's father. Uh, they are supposed to be a couple, yeah, so not believable. If you really love either of them, watch it, other than that save your time and watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer instead.

It was nice and wistful and appropriately sad not necessarily because of the alleged romance but because of this specific time in young woman's life when there's just that bit of girl there.  This movie was sad in a truthful way that Confessions of a Shopaholic was not.  This movie should be expanded (keep Buffy and let her be a Jewish raised in the suburbs living in Manhattan.)  This could be really successful and just full of good ideas already.  It could write itself and would be popular with everyone but mainly teenage girls college bound, college girls and newly graduated because everyone dreams of getting that first job, apartment in Manhattan and Buffy wears clothes well.  It would be very hard to screw up an expansion of this film into a series.  Alec Baldwin comes off absolutely as a buddy not a Romeo.  But who wouldn't want Alec Baldwin as a buddy?  I wish Buffy would go back to her original jet black hair and eyebrows so we can see just how beautiful she is.

1113469,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000X73NC2,Cubist,"[8, 12]","How does an adaptation of best-selling bookThe Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing, starring Sarah Michelle Gellar and Alec Baldwin, go direct-to-video? The obvious answer is that the film isn't that good and that it was rightly relegated to obscurity. However, this is simply not the case as a wonderful, little romantic comedy was unfairly marginalized, making it the third straight film by Gellar to meet this fate (see alsoThe Return (Widescreen Edition)andSouthland Tales), but will hopefully find a new life on home video.The Sarah Bareilles song that plays over the opening credits immediately establishes that this is a stylish New York film a laThe Devil Wears Prada (Widescreen Edition)or the early films of Woody Allen, most notablyAnnie Hall. The first thing that strikes you about this film is its well-written screenplay populated with witty literary references in the form of banter that cheekily references French and Russian literature, Norman Mailer, and visual cues to the likes of Tom Wolfe. However, you don't have to be a bookworm to appreciate the humour in this film - although, it wouldn't hurt to be well-read.After starring in several horror films (The Grudge (Unrated Director's Cut)and The Return), it is nice to see a change of pace for Gellar as she tries her hand at the romantic comedy - something she hasn't done since the under-appreciatedSimply Irresistible. She is beautiful and charming, exerting a vulnerability that is endearing but her character is no wallflower and sticks up for herself when she realizes that she's been wronged and Archie is not the knight in shining armour that she had hoped.If you've watched Alec Baldwin onWill and Grace: Season Sevenor30 Rock - Season 1, you can appreciate the comedic touch that he can bring to a role and in this film he seems to be channeling Mr. Big or Ron Rifkin's Vogue editor from Sex and the City. Some may be turned off by the age difference between Baldwin and Gellar but they do have genuine chemistry together. Even though Brett's age is 24, in actuality Gellar is 30 and so the age difference really shouldn't be that much of an issue.Writer/director Marc Klein isn't afraid to expertly shift the tone from engaging romantic comedy to serious drama as Brett is forced to deal with family issues and then veers back without losing elements of the serious stuff. Despite the pedestrian film title and atrocious DVD cover art that makes it look like Baldwin's head is growing out of Gellar's shoulder; Suburban Girl will survive on video and hopefully be rediscovered by a new audience.There is an engaging audio commentary by writer/director Marc Klein. He mentions that he wished that they could have used the book's original title but were unable to because of rights issues (Francis Ford Coppola owns it). Klein cites Annie Hall as an influence and points out where he paid tribute to it. Klein also praises Baldwin for having the guts to play a character so close to his own real life. This is a chatty track delivered with refreshing earnest by a director clearly proud of his first film.Also included is a trailer for the film.",5,Much better than you think...,1201478400,"01 28, 2008",2008,3127,"['How', 'adaptation', 'best-selling', 'bookThe', 'Girls', 'Guide', 'Hunting', 'Fishing', 'starring', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'go', 'direct-to-video', 'obvious', 'answer', 'film', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'was', 'rightly', 'relegated', 'obscurity', 'However', 'simply', 'not', 'case', 'wonderful', 'little', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'was', 'unfairly', 'marginalized', 'making', 'third', 'straight', 'film', 'Gellar', 'meet', 'fate', 'see', 'alsoThe', 'Return', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'andSouthland', 'Tales', 'will', 'hopefully', 'find', 'new', 'life', 'home', 'video.The', 'Sarah', 'Bareilles', 'song', 'opening', 'credits', 'immediately', 'stylish', 'New', 'York', 'film', 'laThe', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'early', 'films', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'most', 'notablyAnnie', 'Hall', 'first', 'thing', 'film', 'well-written', 'screenplay', 'populated', 'witty', 'literary', 'references', 'form', 'banter', 'cheekily', 'French', 'Russian', 'literature', 'Norman', 'Mailer', 'visual', 'cues', 'likes', 'Tom', 'Wolfe', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'bookworm', 'appreciate', 'humour', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'be', 'well-read.After', 'starring', 'several', 'horror', 'films', 'Grudge', 'Unrated', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Return', 'nice', 'see', 'change', 'pace', 'Gellar', 'hand', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'something', ""n't"", 'done', 'under-appreciatedSimply', 'Irresistible', 'beautiful', 'charming', 'exerting', 'vulnerability', 'endearing', 'character', 'wallflower', 'up', 'herself', 'when', 'been', 'wronged', 'Archie', 'not', 'knight', 'shining', 'armour', 'had', 'hoped.If', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'onWill', 'Grace', 'Season', 'Sevenor30', 'Rock', 'Season', '1', 'can', 'appreciate', 'comedic', 'touch', 'can', 'bring', 'role', 'film', 'be', 'channeling', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', 'Vogue', 'editor', 'Sex', 'City', 'may', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'age', 'difference', 'Baldwin', 'Gellar', 'do', 'have', 'genuine', 'chemistry', 'together', 'Even', 'Brett', 'age', '24', 'actuality', 'Gellar', '30', 'so', 'age', 'difference', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'that', 'much', 'issue.Writer/director', 'Marc', 'Klein', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'expertly', 'shift', 'tone', 'engaging', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'serious', 'drama', 'Brett', 'forced', 'deal', 'family', 'issues', 'then', 'veers', 'back', 'losing', 'elements', 'serious', 'stuff', 'pedestrian', 'film', 'title', 'atrocious', 'DVD', 'cover', 'art', 'look', 'Baldwin', 'head', 'growing', 'Gellar', 'shoulder', 'Suburban', 'Girl', 'will', 'survive', 'video', 'hopefully', 'be', 'rediscovered', 'new', 'audience.There', 'engaging', 'audio', 'commentary', 'writer/director', 'Marc', 'Klein', 'wished', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'book', 'original', 'title', 'were', 'unable', 'rights', 'issues', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'Klein', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'influence', 'points', 'out', 'where', 'paid', 'tribute', 'Klein', 'also', 'Baldwin', 'having', 'guts', 'play', 'character', 'so', 'close', 'own', 'real', 'life', 'chatty', 'track', 'delivered', 'refreshing', 'earnest', 'director', 'clearly', 'proud', 'first', 'film.Also', 'included', 'trailer', 'film']",N/A
1113470,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B000X73NC2,Darren,"[1, 2]","I quite agree with one of the front-page reviewer's comments on this movie that it's reminiscent of Rohmer and French cinema in general.  Of course, the French do this sort of thing better than we do, for the simple reason that we don't do the depiction of May-December romances at all, really, unless it's farce.  Just lately, the cougar/young-man thing seems more common, though it's also understood that &#34;cougar&#34; still means pre-menopausal, not 50+, like Alec Baldwin here.  (Sarah Michelle Gellar herself was 30 when this was released, though her character is supposed to be 24.)  What the French seem to have grasped that we Americans have not is that young women are attracted to older men for a variety of reasons, but probably the main reason is that a man of 40 or 50 years no longer feels like he has to PROVE himself all the time.  And I would imagine it's even better for the lady when that man doesn't simply feel that he no longer has to prove himself, but actually has already done it.  In this case, Baldwin is a wealthy editor at a major publishing firm, and Gellar is an up-and-coming associate at a different firm.  Besides keeping a charming old man company, she can also get some mentoring in from him.  It's a relationship based on ancillary needs, like caretaking and professional advice, rather than deep personal commitment.Not surprisingly, given the subject matter, this movie went straight-to-video.  I think the director tried to reduce the &#34;ick&#34; factor by including some comfortable rom-com cliches early on: the &#34;friend&#34;, the &#34;co-workers&#34;, the &#34;horrible boss&#34;.  But these elements only make cameos, and are more or less dropped in the second half of the movie, when it becomes a serious drama about an unrealistic relationship.  The script also appears to be stitched from several stories from a collection of short stories by Melissa Banks called &#34;The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing&#34; -- a much better title than &#34;Suburban Girl&#34;, and more fitting, too, because that's precisely what Gellar is doing with Baldwin.  Of course, that's also what he's doing with her, and it takes her the length of the movie to figure it out.  As her dad says, &#34;If he's not going to take care of himself, he'll find someone who will.&#34;  While the script is occasionally witty and wise, it also falls on its face a few times.  Gellar performs a drunk scene badly, but the scene was badly written in the first place.  There are the usual convenient coincidences: for example, our heroine is relieved when her brother happens to hear something that sets her mind at ease late in the film.  Setting up a Problem and then solving it in the space of 1 minute is el-cheapo screenwriting.  And the final triumph is the young woman's confidence to finally dare to wear those black leather pants.  To work.  Associate editors don't wear leather pants to work, even if they're only 24 years old.  Oh, wait, that's right, there are no associate editors in important publishing firms who are 24 years old.Well, I more or less liked the movie anyway, if only because it assumed a certain level of sophistication among its audience.  An overconfident assumption, doubtless.  3 out of 5.",3,Unusual subject for an American movie,1392508800,"02 16, 2014",2014,3249,"['quite', 'agree', 'one', 'front-page', 'reviewer', 'comments', 'movie', 'reminiscent', 'Rohmer', 'French', 'cinema', 'general', 'course', 'French', 'do', 'sort', 'thing', 'better', 'do', 'simple', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'depiction', 'May-December', 'romances', 'really', 'farce', 'Just', 'lately', 'cougar/young-man', 'thing', 'more', 'common', 'also', 'understood', '34', 'cougar', '34', 'still', 'pre-menopausal', 'not', '50+', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'here', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'was', '30', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', '24', 'What', 'French', 'seem', 'have', 'grasped', 'Americans', 'have', 'not', 'young', 'women', 'are', 'attracted', 'older', 'men', 'variety', 'reasons', 'probably', 'main', 'reason', 'man', '40', '50', 'years', 'no', 'longer', 'feels', 'PROVE', 'time', 'would', 'imagine', 'even', 'better', 'lady', 'when', 'man', ""n't"", 'simply', 'feel', 'no', 'longer', 'prove', 'actually', 'already', 'done', 'case', 'Baldwin', 'wealthy', 'editor', 'major', 'publishing', 'firm', 'Gellar', 'up-and-coming', 'associate', 'different', 'firm', 'keeping', 'charming', 'old', 'man', 'company', 'can', 'also', 'get', 'mentoring', 'relationship', 'based', 'ancillary', 'needs', 'caretaking', 'professional', 'advice', 'rather', 'deep', 'personal', 'commitment.Not', 'surprisingly', 'given', 'subject', 'matter', 'movie', 'went', 'straight-to-video', 'think', 'director', 'tried', 'reduce', '34', 'ick', '34', 'factor', 'including', 'comfortable', 'rom-com', 'cliches', 'early', '34', 'friend', '34', '34', 'co-workers', '34', '34', 'horrible', 'boss', '34', 'elements', 'only', 'make', 'cameos', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'dropped', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'when', 'serious', 'drama', 'unrealistic', 'relationship', 'script', 'also', 'be', 'stitched', 'several', 'stories', 'collection', 'short', 'stories', 'Melissa', 'Banks', 'called', '34', 'Girls', 'Guide', 'Hunting', 'Fishing', '34', 'much', 'better', 'title', '34', 'Suburban', 'Girl', '34', 'more', 'fitting', 'too', 'precisely', 'what', 'Gellar', 'doing', 'Baldwin', 'course', 'also', 'what', 'doing', 'length', 'movie', 'figure', 'out', 'dad', '34', 'not', 'going', 'take', 'care', ""'ll"", 'find', 'someone', 'who', 'will.', '34', 'script', 'occasionally', 'witty', 'wise', 'also', 'face', 'few', 'times', 'Gellar', 'performs', 'drunk', 'scene', 'badly', 'scene', 'was', 'badly', 'written', 'first', 'place', 'are', 'usual', 'convenient', 'coincidences', 'example', 'heroine', 'relieved', 'when', 'brother', 'hear', 'something', 'mind', 'ease', 'late', 'film', 'Setting', 'up', 'Problem', 'then', 'solving', 'space', '1', 'minute', 'el-cheapo', 'screenwriting', 'final', 'triumph', 'young', 'woman', 'confidence', 'finally', 'dare', 'wear', 'black', 'leather', 'pants', 'work', 'Associate', 'editors', 'do', ""n't"", 'wear', 'leather', 'pants', 'work', 'even', ""'re"", 'only', '24', 'years', 'old', 'Oh', 'wait', 'right', 'are', 'associate', 'editors', 'important', 'publishing', 'firms', 'who', 'are', '24', 'years', 'old.Well', 'more', 'less', 'liked', 'movie', 'anyway', 'only', 'assumed', 'certain', 'level', 'sophistication', 'audience', 'overconfident', 'assumption', 'doubtless', '3', '5']",N/A

He lies to her multiple times, berates her, and repeatedly hurts her in various degrees.  I found myself wondering why this was portrayed as a romance.

The idea of a film about the inner workings of the publishing world is appealing, and Gellar is attractive, but the screenplay just can't rise to the challenge.  The plot somehow manages to be simultaneously predictable and improbable.  The dialogue is pretentious -- suffice to say that for characters who are supposed to be in the upper echelons of New York literati, Baldwin mispronounces the name of the author Borges, on whom he supposedly taught a course, and Gellar mispronounces the name of the artist Renoir.  As other reviewers have pointed out, there is zero chemistry between Gellar and the Baldwin character.  Disturbingly, I thought there was actually more chemistry between her and the actor who played her father.  The most interesting scenes are the fleeting ones between Gellar and her brother, which ring more true than anything else in the film.  Also, the actress who plays Gellar's bimbo lingerie designer friend is a breath of fresh air.

But since it was picked out for me I watched it.Ambiguous is the word that comes to mind. Gellar as Brett is sweetly stumbling through life, attached to a boy and wanting a man, editing with angst, and completely unable to make a decision. Enter a man (Archie played by Baldwin) who knows what he wants (Brett) how to get it with the usual rich, charming, powerful man ploys but with a sweetness that almost brings Ahhh! moments. But the relationship is standardly Pygmalion and the end result is as expected.What I liked: I'm a sucker for movies about writers, so two thumbs up there. Good acting and a nice range of opportunities to stretch with illness, tears, joy. Great writing, snappy dialogue. The sexual aspect of the romance is fairly low key and hidden and mentioned very little. Nasty language is refreshingly replaced with creativity.What I didn't: Baldwin's character is creepy because there always seemed to be an agenda and an air of deception. It almost feels reptilian at times. The fact that he wants to shape Brett is okay but it doesn't always ring true. In a scene where Brett has too much to drink he actually finds her more appealing when she makes a scene. I also found that I didn't really care whether they stayed together or broke up. Brett's family didn't come off as multi-dimensional or dysfunctional as a family of origin so I didn't buy into her childhood issues as much as the script needed me to.Overall, I think that if you can watch Alec Baldwin without shuddering at his personal life, you like the whole Pygmalion thing, chick-lit and/or Gellar, you might enjoy it.",3,Sweet with a Hint of Creepy,1201478400,"01 28, 2008",2008,1691,"['Three', 'half.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', ""'ve"", 'picked', 'movie', 'out', 'video', 'store', 'was', 'picked', 'out', 'watched', 'it.Ambiguous', 'word', 'mind', 'Gellar', 'Brett', 'sweetly', 'stumbling', 'life', 'attached', 'boy', 'wanting', 'man', 'editing', 'angst', 'completely', 'unable', 'make', 'decision', 'Enter', 'man', 'Archie', 'played', 'Baldwin', 'who', 'what', 'Brett', 'how', 'get', 'usual', 'rich', 'charming', 'powerful', 'man', 'ploys', 'sweetness', 'almost', 'Ahhh', 'moments', 'relationship', 'standardly', 'Pygmalion', 'end', 'result', 'expected.What', 'liked', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'movies', 'writers', 'so', 'two', 'thumbs', 'there', 'Good', 'acting', 'nice', 'range', 'opportunities', 'stretch', 'illness', 'tears', 'joy', 'Great', 'writing', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'sexual', 'aspect', 'romance', 'fairly', 'low', 'key', 'hidden', 'mentioned', 'very', 'little', 'Nasty', 'language', 'refreshingly', 'replaced', 'creativity.What', 'did', ""n't"", 'Baldwin', 'character', 'creepy', 'always', 'seemed', 'be', 'agenda', 'air', 'deception', 'almost', 'reptilian', 'times', 'fact', 'shape', 'Brett', 'okay', ""n't"", 'always', 'ring', 'true', 'scene', 'where', 'Brett', 'too', 'much', 'drink', 'actually', 'more', 'appealing', 'when', 'scene', 'also', 'found', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'stayed', 'together', 'broke', 'up', 'Brett', 'family', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'multi-dimensional', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'origin', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'childhood', 'issues', 'as', 'much', 'script', 'needed', 'to.Overall', 'think', 'can', 'watch', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'shuddering', 'personal', 'life', 'whole', 'Pygmalion', 'thing', 'chick-lit', 'and/or', 'Gellar', 'might', 'enjoy']",N/A

1113485,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000X73NC2,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[7, 11]","There is always the potential for a creepiness factor when you are talking a May-December romance story (and I am talking about the usual sort of story where the male is Mr. December and not the rare reversal of form epitomized by ""Harold and Maude"").  But surprisingly the moments of creepiness in ""Suburban Girl"" come not when Alec Baldwin's Alex Knox is putting the moves on Sarah Michelle Gellar's Brett Eisenberg, but when he talks about being estranged from the daughter that does not want to talk to him.  I had to go back and check out the chronology of events and learned that this movie began filming back in May of 2006, which was basically a year before the infamous phone message the actor left for his daughter, which became a cause celebre in those halcyon days before Paris, Britney, and Lindsay started taking their repeated turns melting down for our entertainment.  Since the release of ""Suburban Girl"" came in the wake of that public display of parental hostility, it is impossible not to watch some of these scenes with Baldwin and wonder how close to hit to home.  Fortunately, that is a small part of this film.Brett wants to be an editor at a publishing house when she grows up, but her prospects for advancement at her current place of employment could be derailed by a new boss Faye Faulkner (Vanessa Branch).  Then she runs into Alex, who publishes a newspaper about publishing, and who might actually be as interested in mentoring her as he is in seducing her.  When we meet Brett's boyfriend Jed (Chris Carmack), we understand why Alex would strike Brett as a real man.  But it is not until we meet her father, Robert (James Naughton), that we become aware that Brett has daddy issues.  To be fair, if Brett wants to end up with somebody just like her dear old dad that seems like a good deal, which means the question is whether or not Alex really measures up to Robert.  We might be tempted to think that Alex has daughter issues, given the strained relationship mentioned above, but there is a scrapbook that makes it clear the women in his life stay the same while he keeps on aging.  You never get the feeling that Alex and Brett are made for each other, but in the philosophy of interpersonal relationships once articulated byRocky Balboa, they fill each other's gaps.  They also tend to make some of those gaps a lot bigger.This is a strange film in that it never really seems to find its niche.  I liked the performance, but the chemistry between the leads is more intellectual than it is romantic, and there are some nice funny lines in this movie, but it is neither a romantic comedy or truly a romantic drama.  I also like the way the story resolves itself, but I never felt emotionally invested in what was going on.  The script is based on short stories from Melissa Bank's collection ""The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing,"" a fact which is pointed out during the opening credits, and in retrospect ""Suburban Girl"" seems like a slice of Brett's life and not a complete story.  The title never really makes sense, since Brett is living and working in the big city and not the suburbs where her family still lives, and I wonder how much of the stuff in the title cards regarding proofreading marks comes from the book or from the screenplay by first time director Marc Klein (""Serendipity""), especially since I thought there could be more of that.  It goes without saying that I checked out ""Suburban Girl"" because of Gellar, since I consume all thingsBuffyrelated, and I am surprised that she is, at best, treading water with regards to her career.  At least this movie will remind Hollywood she is still out there and if ""Suburban Girl"" does not help, it certainly does not hurt (Gellar is one of the best weepers out there today).",4,Alec Baldwin's Mr. December hooks up with Sarah Michelle Gellar's Miss May,1200441600,"01 16, 2008",2008,3776,"['always', 'potential', 'creepiness', 'factor', 'when', 'are', 'talking', 'May-December', 'romance', 'story', 'am', 'talking', 'usual', 'sort', 'story', 'where', 'male', 'Mr.', 'December', 'not', 'rare', 'reversal', 'form', 'epitomized', 'Harold', 'Maude', 'surprisingly', 'moments', 'creepiness', 'Suburban', 'Girl', 'come', 'not', 'when', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Alex', 'Knox', 'putting', 'moves', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Brett', 'Eisenberg', 'when', 'being', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'not', 'want', 'talk', 'had', 'go', 'back', 'check', 'out', 'chronology', 'events', 'learned', 'movie', 'began', 'filming', 'back', 'May', '2006', 'was', 'basically', 'year', 'infamous', 'phone', 'message', 'actor', 'left', 'daughter', 'became', 'cause', 'celebre', 'halcyon', 'days', 'Paris', 'Britney', 'Lindsay', 'started', 'taking', 'repeated', 'turns', 'melting', 'down', 'entertainment', 'release', 'Suburban', 'Girl', 'came', 'wake', 'public', 'display', 'parental', 'hostility', 'impossible', 'not', 'watch', 'scenes', 'Baldwin', 'wonder', 'how', 'close', 'hit', 'home', 'Fortunately', 'small', 'part', 'film.Brett', 'be', 'editor', 'publishing', 'house', 'when', 'up', 'prospects', 'advancement', 'current', 'place', 'employment', 'could', 'be', 'derailed', 'new', 'boss', 'Faye', 'Faulkner', 'Vanessa', 'Branch', 'Then', 'Alex', 'who', 'newspaper', 'publishing', 'who', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'interested', 'mentoring', 'seducing', 'When', 'meet', 'Brett', 'boyfriend', 'Jed', 'Chris', 'Carmack', 'understand', 'why', 'Alex', 'would', 'strike', 'Brett', 'real', 'man', 'not', 'meet', 'father', 'Robert', 'James', 'Naughton', 'become', 'aware', 'Brett', 'daddy', 'issues', 'be', 'fair', 'Brett', 'end', 'up', 'somebody', 'just', 'dear', 'old', 'dad', 'good', 'deal', 'question', 'not', 'Alex', 'really', 'up', 'Robert', 'might', 'be', 'tempted', 'think', 'Alex', 'daughter', 'issues', 'given', 'strained', 'relationship', 'mentioned', 'scrapbook', 'clear', 'women', 'life', 'stay', 'same', 'aging', 'never', 'get', 'feeling', 'Alex', 'Brett', 'are', 'made', 'other', 'philosophy', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'once', 'articulated', 'byRocky', 'Balboa', 'fill', 'other', 'gaps', 'also', 'tend', 'make', 'gaps', 'lot', 'bigger.This', 'strange', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'find', 'niche', 'liked', 'performance', 'chemistry', 'leads', 'more', 'intellectual', 'romantic', 'are', 'nice', 'funny', 'lines', 'movie', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'truly', 'romantic', 'drama', 'also', 'way', 'story', 'never', 'felt', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'script', 'based', 'short', 'stories', 'Melissa', 'Bank', 'collection', 'Girls', 'Guide', 'Hunting', 'Fishing', 'fact', 'pointed', 'out', 'opening', 'credits', 'retrospect', 'Suburban', 'Girl', 'slice', 'Brett', 'life', 'not', 'complete', 'story', 'title', 'never', 'really', 'sense', 'Brett', 'living', 'working', 'big', 'city', 'not', 'suburbs', 'where', 'family', 'still', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'stuff', 'title', 'cards', 'regarding', 'proofreading', 'marks', 'book', 'screenplay', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Marc', 'Klein', 'Serendipity', 'especially', 'thought', 'there', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'saying', 'checked', 'out', 'Suburban', 'Girl', 'Gellar', 'consume', 'thingsBuffyrelated', 'am', 'surprised', 'best', 'treading', 'water', 'regards', 'career', 'least', 'movie', 'will', 'remind', 'Hollywood', 'still', 'there', 'Suburban', 'Girl', 'not', 'help', 'certainly', 'not', 'hurt', 'Gellar', 'one', 'best', 'weepers', 'out', 'there', 'today']",N/A

How could a movie with charismatic actors (Alec Baldwin and Sarah Michele Gellar) based on a great book (The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing) be so bad?  Sure I had a vague thought of didn't this movie go straight to video release?  but I pushed it aside and rented it because the reviews here were mixed and I was a big fan of the book and actors starring in it.  How bad could it really be?  The answer is really, REALLY bad.  The actors displayed their usual charm but they lacked chemistry together.  A bad thing when it's a romantic comedy.  Come to think of it, there wasn't much chemistry between any of the actors.  Another deal breaker was the lack of a strong daughter/father relationship in the movie.  This was key to the story in book form and it did not translate onto screen.  In fact, the whole story didn't translate onto screen properly.  It missed the whole poignancy of the book, a young woman having to grow up.  This film did not engage me in the least and I was looking forward to watching it!This is what stayed with me after viewing - did the actors owe the director, producer or the studio?  otherwise, the editor did a chop job that should seal their fate in the industry - and nothing about the film itself.

If Sarah had not been in this movie I probably would not have watched more than ten minutes of it.One thing that I did like was the idea that a man who is slightly younger than I am could get a girlfriend like Sarah Michelle Geller.

I have two minor complaints, firstly the title is misleading; makes it look like a much cheaper movie when it's pretty intelligent and sentimental if not particularly subtle. Also the female lead should have been someone closer in age to real jailbait or at least more believable than Buffy gone frumpy. The character is an old soul in a young body - so the combination of character's mature behavior + Buffy's real age (31) makes the jailbait jokes horribly awkward.

1113497,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B000X73NC2,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[2, 4]","I am not sure what it is about Sarah Michelle Gellar that has me bewitched.  Perhaps it is because her presentation in ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" has left a permanent blemish on my psyche.  Perhaps it is because I find something compelling about her performances. Perhaps it is the fact that she was born the same year, month and eight days after I.  Perhaps it is just because I find her very attractive and on a carnal level I desire her.  Regardless of the reason, I have watched many of her movies and television shows.  The conclusion I have arrived to is many of the projects she is involved in are hit or miss.So here we have ""Suburban Girl"", a 2007 romantic-comedy staring Sarah Michelle Gellar and uh...Alec Baldwin.  Before I even watched this movie I felt that this was an odd pair for a love story, but I decided that I wasn't going to have a bias and give the movie a fair chance.  The plot is Brett (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is an assistant book editor in New York City and she is a bit timid and self-conscious but hopeful one day of becoming a full-fledged editor.  One day she meets a very well know publisher named Archie Knox (Alec Baldwin), under a rather dubious introduction.  To paraphrase, the two use their grounds of the published word to spark a connection and begin a romantic relationship.  There are ups and downs, intense feelings and empty promises.  Not to mention that Archie is about 20 years older than Brett, this promotes a whole other set of problems.I have to say this movie was flat out deplorable. I hated Archie and Brett and quite honestly didn't care if they stayed together, broke up or dropped dead.  There was zero chemistry between Gellar and Baldwin. To be perfectly frank, I am not sure who decided to cast Alec Baldwin, but it was a total party foul.  Alec Baldwin about twenty years ago might have worked.  When he was more handsome and smooth, Baldwin in the past ten years is only good for crude comedy and commercials.  Otherwise he is a shadow of his former self.  I do not see Brett going for Archie, with Baldwin in the role.  I could see Richard Gere, Brad Pitt, George Clooney or David Duchovny as Archie....not bloated Alec Baldwin.Another issue with this movie is it really wasn't a comedy (It was actually really depressing).  Now I don't need chuckles or ""LOL"" moments in order to enjoy a movie, yet to label this movie as a comedy is false advertising.  As a matter of fact, this was a melodrama engulfed with eye rolling dialogue/romance and never ending calamities.  With regards to the calamities, it was like the writers just had to keep throwing havoc at the viewers.  From Brett's dizzy ex-boyfriend, Archie's drinking problem, Brett's father's health, and Archie's ex-girlfriends and is this relationship balanced or is it a teacher/student paradigm.  Blah, blah, blah....I could go on yet there is no point. I have watched some awful movies in my day, films that range from Hollywood Blockbusters to motion pictures that have a backyard production.  I can report, in all truth this movie falls into my top ten of worst movies of all time...and I hated ""The Human Centipede"".

The pairing of Alec Baldwin and Sarah Michelle Gellar was not altogether bad - this was intentional in the movie. Alec Baldwin plays Archie, a sophisticated, older man who is also CEO of a successful publishing company who finds himself attracted to a much younger woman, Brett (Sarah Michelle Gellar)who is trying to establish herself in the cut-throat world of publishing. A May-December romance inevitably ensues with all the typical cliches - Brett is initially flattered by Archie's persistent and charming ploys to gain her affection but as time passes and their relationship gets more serious, she begins to see the darker side of their romance. The typical stereotype of an older man trying to mold a younger woman to be his ideal partner is heavily conveyed here. Brett chafes at this but also craves his advice and mentoring - a sort of mentor-mentee relationship.Is this movie creepy? Not really, at least not for me - the fact is such relationships are far more common these days, and the only thing I found wanting here was the lack of strong chemistry between the two leads. The romantic scenes (thankfully, the most these two get into in this movie is deep kissing) are subtly done without going over the top. No nudity or baring of parts here - I do not believe it was the movie's intent to focus on the physical part of the relationship but more of the emotional connection - Archie needs Brett not just for physical intimacy but more for the missing element in his life, and similarly Brett is attracted to Archie for his intellectuality and guidance. It's a sort of symbiotic relationship that gradually unravels as Brett matures and finds her own 'voice'. I liked the focus on the publishing world, and think this is worth a watch but this is not a romantic comedy.",3,A story about finding one's self,1278201600,"07 4, 2010",2010,1924,"['did', 'not', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'worthy', 'five', 'stars', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'as', 'awful', 'reviews', 'here', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'pairing', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'was', 'not', 'altogether', 'bad', 'was', 'intentional', 'movie', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Archie', 'sophisticated', 'older', 'man', 'who', 'also', 'CEO', 'successful', 'publishing', 'company', 'who', 'attracted', 'much', 'younger', 'woman', 'Brett', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'who', 'trying', 'establish', 'cut-throat', 'world', 'publishing', 'May-December', 'romance', 'inevitably', 'typical', 'cliches', 'Brett', 'initially', 'flattered', 'Archie', 'persistent', 'charming', 'ploys', 'gain', 'affection', 'time', 'passes', 'relationship', 'more', 'serious', 'see', 'darker', 'side', 'romance', 'typical', 'stereotype', 'older', 'man', 'trying', 'mold', 'younger', 'woman', 'be', 'ideal', 'partner', 'heavily', 'conveyed', 'here', 'Brett', 'chafes', 'also', 'advice', 'mentoring', 'sort', 'mentor-mentee', 'relationship.Is', 'movie', 'creepy', 'Not', 'really', 'least', 'not', 'fact', 'such', 'relationships', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'common', 'days', 'only', 'thing', 'found', 'wanting', 'here', 'was', 'lack', 'strong', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'thankfully', 'most', 'two', 'get', 'movie', 'deep', 'kissing', 'are', 'subtly', 'done', 'going', 'top', 'nudity', 'baring', 'parts', 'here', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'was', 'movie', 'intent', 'focus', 'physical', 'part', 'relationship', 'more', 'emotional', 'connection', 'Archie', 'needs', 'Brett', 'not', 'just', 'physical', 'intimacy', 'more', 'missing', 'element', 'life', 'similarly', 'Brett', 'attracted', 'Archie', 'intellectuality', 'guidance', 'sort', 'symbiotic', 'relationship', 'gradually', 'Brett', 'matures', 'own', ""'voice"", 'liked', 'focus', 'publishing', 'world', 'think', 'watch', 'not', 'romantic', 'comedy']",N/A
