The people all act strange, and only one woman and a mysterious stranger(Chuck Norris) will help them. A powerful immortal controls the town with his demonic horde. Good and evil battle for the town and its children, and the 3 men will help decide the outcome. Their only weapon is their faith, but will even it be enough to save them?BOI is a good film. The actors aren't that great, but the storyline is good and the special effects work for a budget film. It's slow in parts and could have used some serious trimming, but for the most part the story moves along. There are some action sequences with Chuck's son, Mike, doing most of the fighting (Chuck doesn't throw a single punch). Don't be mistaken though, this is a plot-driven story, not a fighting one. Even though this is touted as a Christian film, profanity is used twice in it (though I have no idea why you'd do that in a church film).An interesting concept, and I guess it works. Imagine a Christian episode of the X-Files. The climax of the film is the payoff for watching it. It's just a shame that it takes so long to reach the really good part. But hey, it's definitely better than the Left Behind films.

Intense and horrifying--as a movie dealing with Satan, soul stealing, and the horrors of hell should be.  Mike Norris plays ""Jux,"" a man out of fellowship and in a dark place personally after his wife left him, blaming him for their daughter's death.  Yet Jux agrees to pilot his Christian buds Conrad and Oren to transport their collected Bibles to Mexico.  The plane crashes outside ""Ceres,"" a place that ""doesn't even look like the planet Earth, man,"" ""dirt, and a lot of sky,"" ""not a place but a what.""  Hmmmm....Ceres, I recall from mythology, was the Roman name for the goddess who went looking for her daughter that was kidnapped by Hades.  But that's not spoiling the movie, it's full of surprises--though yeah, it's about setting captives free.  This movie's desert town of Ceres is populated by mark-bearing drones with superhuman strength and kids dressed like Little House on the Prairie...and then there's supercool ""Michael,"" played by Chuck Norris, of course.  ""Bells of Innocence"" caught my eye in the store at a time when I'd been praying for wisdom for what to do after I heard an other-worldly, threatening voice come out of a zombie-like shell of a person whose eyes normally were lifelessly void or displayed flashes of imprisoned fear, not the blazing hate that accompanied the demonic voice.  Anyway, ""Bells of Innocence"" helped me to stand firm in faith,  to strengthen my commitment to Jesus, to intercession, and to ""fear not man who can kill the body but not the soul.""

And you'll enjoy every minute of this gut-busting spoof (or is it?) about three guys, a town full of devil worshipers, and a family-approved message to keep on keepin' on. The main character is an archangel in the form of kung-fu master Chuck Norris. Chuck the Archangel is the only ticket out of this one-way town, using the power of God to light lamps, unlock doors, erect walls of 3D computer generated fires, and preach the Gospel with an astounding ""you can do it, boys"" all before the sun sets in west Texas. The battle is against the mayor of the town, who has a bloodthirsty lust to exterminate all of the ""ambassadors of the Gospel who must be stopped...[yes, master]"" so he can continue draining the souls of the little children in the town and holding his 'harvest party seances' in the town square. (...Nice. Who thought of that one?) Everyone fears him. The man literally disappears before your eyes and then reappears with wonderful white smoke and sparks. (...Magic trick.) Chuck Norris can talk him down though, simply by telling them to get off his property or he'll have to bust them up, Gospel-style. But before Chuck can flip to Corinthians the devil leaves and the boys are left with Chuck to do some hard training. Chuck trains them right so they can be fit and ready to meet the devil in the town square, to fight him off in a battle of faith and wits.Now for the other characters. The stereotypes are vividly clear from the get-go. We have two guys who both love Jesus, and one is on the fence. The one who is on the fence is an alcoholic and lost his daughter and is feeling horrible about it. From the time they crash the plane and arrive at the town, this guy is going through alcohol withdrawal. Really, does anyone got a beer, man? No one seems to...at least not in this town. Wait, did you ask Chuck yet? Chuck's got the hookups. As he lights his cigar, he gives the man a beer. Oh wait, no, that's a PROP of a beer. TBN says we can't have any alcoholic paraphernalia on the movie set!If you've always wanted to see what angels look like, you can watch this movie and find out for sure. I know when I get to heaven I'll see a thousand Chuck Norrises and they will all welcome me in with a spinning roundhouse kick (because they can fly). Aside from the message this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities. But, it does make for a great night with popcorn and some good laughs. It is honestly one of the cheesiest movies my wife and I have ever seen.Chuck really can do everything, including saving souls from the devil's grasp in the process.I just have one last question - when I die and go to heaven, will I see Chuck Norris welcoming me at heaven's gate?

The only thing it lacks, that the other two BELLS movies have, is some strong singing by good male singers.  But for action, suspense, martial arts and Christianity, this movie outdoes BELLS ARE RINGING for sure, and it squeaks by the ultra-religious BELLS OF ST MARY'S by a nose, for its dark story of Stan taking over all the members of a little Mexican town is rather scary, which I liked.  However, some singing would have been good because Chuck Norris has a great voice.  And the film's composer, Amin Emam, knows how to write a good melody when he wants to.  Between Amin Emam and Alin Bijan, the director, I get mixed up with the names of the principal filmmakers, God bless them all.Mike Norris, now there's a he-man.  He was one of the best reasons to go to see Dad Chuck's earlier movies OCTAGON and FORCE OF ONE.  here he does his old man one better, and even convinced the paterfamilias to co-star with him in a strange, unearthly part.  I'm almost convinced he was an angel!  Mike Norris is a powerful filmmaker with the best intentions.  Some have said the two Norrises don't look that much alike, and some have speculated that maybe Mike was adopted by Chuck and his wife as part of their program to take care of all the unloved children of the world.  But actually if you study the facial hair of both Matthew (Chuck) and Jux (Mike) in this movie, you will see a rewarding similarity.  They have the same beard!  (In Mike's case mere stubble.)I wondered why they use the name ""Ceres"" for their little town of the damned.  For Ceres in ancient mythology was not a devilish figure.  Instead she was the goddess of the harvest, of renewed springtime, and the abundance of good food.  We get the word ""cereal"" from her name.

Mintah ""Author of the Heart""","[9, 9]","Bells of Innocence is a thriller with a Christian faith-based theme, but is not too preachy, and succeeds in the creator's efforts to appeal to secular as well as religious audiences.Chuck Norris stars as the mysterious Matthew, who assists three friends whose plane has crashed in a remote, sinister Texas town that is not found on any map.  Mike Norris, Chuck's son, plays Jux, a tormented soul who has lost his faith with his young daughter's death.  The three friends soon find themselves in a battle against Satan's minions for the souls of the town, and most importantly, the children who are being manipulated and used.Though this film may be billed as a family movie, with no nudity or profanity, this is a dark thriller for adults.  There are terrifying and violent scenes.  The movie starts off slow, but it pulls the viewer in and scares you as bad as any secular horror film.  Do not watch this film at night.As far as those Amazon reviewers who have panned the film and said the acting was horrible, if they can genuinely cry as Mike Norris did in the climatic scene, then I would take their comments seriously.  The acting was not horrible.  It was solid, especially the villianious Joshua, played by Marshall Teague.Very odd is that the only actor who WAS poor, David White (Conrad), looks exactly like Chuck Norris.  I spent the entire movie thinking that White was Norris' son.  Mike Norris in reality looks nothing like his father, and even looks the same age as Chuck.

809362,AKX28FGA6L47J,B0001KREGC,Mark,"[5, 6]","Let me preface this review by saying that I am a big fan of Chuck Norris. From everything I've read about him, I admire him very much persoanlly and as a martial artist myself with a black belt in karate, it goes without saying that I enjoy his films as well.Which is why I was so disappointed when I purchased and saw this movie.I've usually enjoyed movies that have religious overtones and depict the timeless struggle between the forces of good versus the forces of evil. One needs to look no further than films like The Omen and The Exorcist, for example, to see how well these films can be made.And while The Bells of Innocence - about this same struggle in a remote area of Texas - certainly sounded like it had all the ""right stuff"". it, unfortunately, did not manage to pull it off.Firstly, with the exception of Chuck, who had a relatively small role in Bells, the rest of the actors were absolutely dreadful. As much as I like Chuck, it's unlikely that you will ever see him garner any Best Acting awards. However, compared to the ""stiffs"" in this film, Chuck comes off looking like Laurence Olivier..!!With respect to the plot, it's one of those films that you think is going to ""break out"" at any moment and generate something resembling a plot.

However, although the intentions of filmmaker Mike Norris and his dad, Chuck, are to be commended, the execution of this film falls far below what one might have expected.  Chuck plays a mysterious stranger named Matthew, who we find out later is an angel, sent to watch over this misguided town called Ceres, the gateway to hell.  Mike is Jux, a tormented parent who feels guilt over the accidental death of his daughter and who is marked by a young tyke in this strange little town.  The town is ruled by a dark angel played by Marshall Teague, and another evil man named Emeritus.  What was intended to be a frightening look at this showdown is merely a dull and tedious film with little suspense or novelty employed.  The rest of the cast is woefully ineffectual and the movie's ending is far from satisfying.  BELLS OF INNOCENCE is nowhere near THE EXORCIST or THE OMEN in its depiction of the apocalyptic battle, and only Norris fans will likely find it enjoyable.",2,DUMB BELLS,1119139200,"06 19, 2005",2005,1060,"['eternal', 'story', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'explored', 'BELLS', 'OF', 'INNOCENCE', 'However', 'intentions', 'filmmaker', 'Mike', 'Norris', 'dad', 'Chuck', 'are', 'be', 'commended', 'execution', 'film', 'far', 'what', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'expected', 'Chuck', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'named', 'Matthew', 'who', 'find', 'out', 'later', 'angel', 'sent', 'watch', 'misguided', 'town', 'called', 'Ceres', 'gateway', 'hell', 'Mike', 'Jux', 'tormented', 'parent', 'who', 'guilt', 'accidental', 'death', 'daughter', 'who', 'marked', 'young', 'tyke', 'strange', 'little', 'town', 'town', 'ruled', 'dark', 'angel', 'played', 'Marshall', 'Teague', 'evil', 'man', 'named', 'Emeritus', 'What', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'frightening', 'look', 'showdown', 'merely', 'dull', 'tedious', 'film', 'little', 'suspense', 'novelty', 'employed', 'rest', 'cast', 'woefully', 'ineffectual', 'movie', 'ending', 'far', 'satisfying', 'BELLS', 'INNOCENCE', 'nowhere', 'THE', 'EXORCIST', 'THE', 'OMEN', 'depiction', 'apocalyptic', 'battle', 'only', 'Norris', 'fans', 'will', 'likely', 'find', 'enjoyable']",N/A

Their plane runs out of oil and they have to land in the middle of nowhere, somewhere in Texas. They find a small town where there is no phone and everybody's acting strange, especially the children. Chuck Norris appears as a mysterious man with a horse. After a while it turns out the town has been taken over by the devil or something like that and that our three christian heroes must save the children.Even though I know that whenever a film stars David A.R. White, the film is always some sort of christian propaganda, and usually not well made. Still, ""Bells of Innocence"" was surprisingly badly made. The special effects were what you might have expected from a 1960s movie, and all of the dialogue, and the entire story, was laughable.If you're looking for a good movie, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a Chuck Norris movie, look elsewhere. He only plays a minor character.

The Mexican church would like to hand the Bibles out free to anyone who needs them, but cannot afford it themselves and the church that the three friends (Jux, Oren, Conrad) attend has bought the Bibles for them. While flying their small twin-engine plane, the plane starts to sputter and after sending out several May Day warnings Jux, Oren, and Conrad crash-land somewhere in the desert. Walking for several miles they come across a town. But the town they wander into isn't any ordinary town. It looks like a village from the 1800s mixed with items from the 1950s. They later learn that the village is cursed and actually is a type of gateway from Hell. Unless the three wanderers each personally face the evil that has possessed the village, the children of the village will become servants of the Dark One.BELLS OF INNOCENCE is a kind of bizarre movie. At it's core is the Gospel story of Jesus: how God became man to save us from our sins and from eternal damnation. But the movie chooses to present the story in an unusual format; a sort of hybrid between a buddy-flick Western and an Apocalyptic sci-fi adventure. At times the movie seems inspired by THE TWILIGHT ZONE.  Then again, at other times it seems like a bad lost episode of WALKER, TEXAS RANGER without Walker.Much of the dialogue isn't all that original and often seems trite. Nevertheless, there are some moments of solid acting, both in the dramatic and comic veins. Chuck Norris produced the film and plays an important secondary role. However, he doesn't do any of the famous martial arts tricks that he has become famous. His son, Mike Norris, wrote the screenplay and stars in the central role of Jux Jonas.  Like the name suggests, the character of Jux is a juxtaposition of the two sides of a tormented soul--a man who knows what is right, but is torn by good desires and an unability to relinquish his pain. Despite some of the bad dialogue and cheap filmmaking, Mike Norris pulls off a rather memorable performance. David A.R. White and Carey Scott also give decent supporting performances as well.There's a lot about BELLS OF INNONCENCE that reeks of immature and inexperienced filmmaking (the editing, some of the pacing, etc.) There are also moments that make the rather low budget obvious.  But these are things that any first time filmmaker with a limited budget has to deal with.BELLS OF INNONCENCE was made and marketed as a ""Christian"" movie and outside of being shown in a few churches, it went straight to video. There are some Christian church goers who might be offended by some of the film's violence and the two ""bad"" words that are spoken. Despite all of this (and the times I found myself laughing during the movie), the video has a few moments of interest and originality. BELLS OF INNONCENCE is kind of original and because of the A for effort that most of the cast and crew deserve (and because of the moments that will make you laugh, despite the movie's severity), I rank the movie at the bottom of the average movie pile.",3,The Spiritual is Made Manifest.,1107820800,"02 8, 2005",2005,3148,"['BELLS', 'OF', 'INNONCENCE', 'story', 'three', 'friends', 'who', 'agree', 'fly', 'bunch', 'Bibles', 'small', 'Protestant', 'church', 'Mexico', 'Mexican', 'church', 'would', 'like', 'hand', 'Bibles', 'out', 'free', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'church', 'three', 'friends', 'Jux', 'Oren', 'Conrad', 'attend', 'bought', 'Bibles', 'flying', 'small', 'twin-engine', 'plane', 'plane', 'sputter', 'sending', 'out', 'several', 'May', 'Day', 'Jux', 'Oren', 'Conrad', 'crash-land', 'somewhere', 'desert', 'Walking', 'several', 'miles', 'come', 'town', 'town', 'wander', ""n't"", 'ordinary', 'town', 'village', '1800s', 'mixed', 'items', '1950s', 'later', 'learn', 'village', 'cursed', 'actually', 'type', 'gateway', 'Hell', 'three', 'wanderers', 'personally', 'face', 'evil', 'possessed', 'village', 'children', 'village', 'will', 'become', 'servants', 'Dark', 'One.BELLS', 'OF', 'INNOCENCE', 'kind', 'bizarre', 'movie', 'core', 'Gospel', 'story', 'Jesus', 'how', 'God', 'became', 'man', 'save', 'sins', 'eternal', 'damnation', 'movie', 'present', 'story', 'unusual', 'format', 'sort', 'hybrid', 'buddy-flick', 'Western', 'Apocalyptic', 'sci-fi', 'adventure', 'times', 'movie', 'inspired', 'THE', 'TWILIGHT', 'ZONE', 'Then', 'again', 'other', 'times', 'bad', 'lost', 'episode', 'WALKER', 'TEXAS', 'RANGER', 'Walker.Much', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'original', 'often', 'trite', 'Nevertheless', 'are', 'moments', 'solid', 'acting', 'dramatic', 'comic', 'veins', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'produced', 'film', 'important', 'secondary', 'role', 'However', ""n't"", 'do', 'famous', 'martial', 'arts', 'tricks', 'become', 'famous', 'son', 'Mike', 'Norris', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'stars', 'central', 'role', 'Jux', 'Jonas', 'name', 'character', 'Jux', 'juxtaposition', 'two', 'sides', 'tormented', 'soul', 'man', 'who', 'what', 'right', 'torn', 'good', 'desires', 'unability', 'relinquish', 'pain', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'cheap', 'filmmaking', 'Mike', 'Norris', 'off', 'rather', 'memorable', 'performance', 'David', 'A.R', 'White', 'Carey', 'Scott', 'also', 'give', 'decent', 'supporting', 'performances', 'lot', 'BELLS', 'OF', 'INNONCENCE', 'reeks', 'immature', 'inexperienced', 'filmmaking', 'editing', 'pacing', 'etc', 'are', 'also', 'moments', 'make', 'rather', 'low', 'budget', 'obvious', 'are', 'things', 'first', 'time', 'filmmaker', 'limited', 'budget', 'deal', 'with.BELLS', 'OF', 'INNONCENCE', 'was', 'made', 'marketed', 'Christian', 'movie', 'outside', 'being', 'shown', 'few', 'churches', 'went', 'straight', 'video', 'are', 'Christian', 'church', 'goers', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'offended', 'film', 'violence', 'two', 'bad', 'words', 'are', 'spoken', 'times', 'found', 'laughing', 'movie', 'video', 'few', 'moments', 'interest', 'originality', 'BELLS', 'INNONCENCE', 'kind', 'original', 'A', 'effort', 'most', 'cast', 'crew', 'deserve', 'moments', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'movie', 'severity', 'rank', 'movie', 'bottom', 'average', 'movie', 'pile']",N/A
