993255,AY12DBB0U420B,B000FOPPBK,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","One of the bargain DVDs I picked up last week was an ""Action Double Feature"" with two  Sylvester Stallone movies: ""Demolition Man"" and ""Over The Top."" Well, I haven't seen a Sylvester Stallone movie in over three decades. I quit going to them because of the poor acting, but I went back here for another try because I perceived the DVD to be a bargain at five bucks. It was worth while. The acting was still bad, but it was bad in a funny sort of way. Maybe I'm mellowing.In ""Demolition Man"" we view a futuristic Southern California city called San Angeles which includes everything  from Santa Barbara through San Diego. There's a lot of funny things in it like automatic graffiti-making equipment. It's funny. Also, the inhabitants are ticketed for using foul language and Stallone picks up quit a bundle of tickets. The so-called Demolition Man lives up to his name, that's for certain. In general, the humor is sophomoric, but I got a few good chuckles.""Over the Top is the better movie, in my opinion. It still has poor acting, but carries a sort of rolling humor with it that makes you chuckle with the scenes. For a really funny episode, linger over the Neanderthals participating in the World  Championship of Arm Wrestling. I've never witnessed such a collection of knuckle walkers in the same room. In any case, this movie had less death and destruction and was a touching little story, involving a small boy, that any father will probably appreciate. Little boys will like it too. I'd say this one is much more ""family friendly"" if that's of any concern.This is a worthwhile double-feature DVD. It's not deep, but it's fun entertainment. I'd give it a good four stars. Enjoy the viewing.Gary Peterson",4,A Bargain Double Feature. Fun Entertainment.
