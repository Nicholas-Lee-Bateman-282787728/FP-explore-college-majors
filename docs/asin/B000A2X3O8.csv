The polar ice is melting, and strange oceanic phenomena are threatening undersea traffic, and possibly the world. The U.N. decides to launch nuclear weapons in order to save the North Pole. The missiles are launched from a polar research facility, only to be overcome by an electromagnetic pulse. The facility is attacked by gigantic electric eels (!!). A team, led by David Keith, is dispatched to find out what happened. DEEP SHOCK is one of those unfortunate sci-fi epics that suffers from its lack of decent special effects. While the plot is absurd, the acting and sets aren't bad. It's a shame that the monsters ruin everything once they appear!

The acting was superb. I was especially impressed with the bad guy. He had a great deal of presence on the screen and as another review said, you wanted to beat him in the face. Great job.Now for the negatives. The writing was ABYSMAL. The writers evidently got their character profiles from saturday morning cartoons. They took a great story line and fed it into a blender to make as generic and bland as possible. These are obviously failed TV sitcom writers who used family to get a job on this picture. Then there was the inappropriate boy girl sex scene just as she was about to finish the code and save mankind. Oh-- and let's not forget the personal dialog just as they were about to launch the mini sub. That is just what I would have been thinking about at that moment. I would say the writers were two, possibly three middle aged female accountants who used personal financial information to blackmail the producer into letting them write the script. That is the only possible way these writer were given the great chance that they totally blew. That dialog was right out of an ABC family network sitcom. Meant for teenage girls who aren't listening anyway. It is sad to think of what a great movie they could have had with the same money they spent.P.S.I amend this about the writers. Two of them were first time writers, which means they did the typing in order to get their name on a script. According to IMDB neither of them has done anything else in the movie industry since. I wonder why? Phillip J. Roth, who also directed this is also one of the writers, although he had his name removed. He is the guy who has directed 23 cheesy, subclass SYFY channel movies, mostly about pythons and flying shark. He has found his niche and has no regret. You'd think after 23 he would have developed some sense of story, but then it is for SYFY channel, so it isn't really necessary.",4,The writers weren't up to the material.,1378425600,"09 6, 2013",2013,2026,"['production', 'values', 'were', 'enjoyably', 'high', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'worked', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'interfere', 'flow', 'movie', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'was', 'especially', 'impressed', 'bad', 'guy', 'had', 'great', 'deal', 'presence', 'screen', 'review', 'said', 'wanted', 'beat', 'face', 'Great', 'job.Now', 'negatives', 'writing', 'was', 'ABYSMAL', 'writers', 'evidently', 'got', 'character', 'profiles', 'saturday', 'morning', 'cartoons', 'took', 'great', 'story', 'line', 'fed', 'blender', 'make', 'generic', 'bland', 'possible', 'are', 'obviously', 'failed', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'writers', 'who', 'used', 'family', 'get', 'job', 'picture', 'Then', 'was', 'inappropriate', 'boy', 'girl', 'sex', 'scene', 'just', 'was', 'about', 'finish', 'code', 'save', 'mankind', 'Oh', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'personal', 'dialog', 'just', 'were', 'about', 'launch', 'mini', 'sub', 'just', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'thinking', 'about', 'moment', 'would', 'say', 'writers', 'were', 'two', 'possibly', 'three', 'middle', 'aged', 'female', 'accountants', 'who', 'used', 'personal', 'financial', 'information', 'blackmail', 'producer', 'letting', 'write', 'script', 'only', 'possible', 'way', 'writer', 'were', 'given', 'great', 'chance', 'totally', 'blew', 'dialog', 'was', 'right', 'ABC', 'family', 'network', 'sitcom', 'Meant', 'teenage', 'girls', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'listening', 'anyway', 'sad', 'think', 'what', 'great', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'same', 'money', 'spent.P.S.I', 'amend', 'writers', 'Two', 'were', 'first', 'time', 'writers', 'did', 'typing', 'order', 'get', 'name', 'script', 'According', 'IMDB', 'neither', 'done', 'anything', 'else', 'movie', 'industry', 'wonder', 'why', 'Phillip', 'J.', 'Roth', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'also', 'one', 'writers', 'had', 'name', 'removed', 'guy', 'who', 'directed', '23', 'cheesy', 'subclass', 'SYFY', 'channel', 'movies', 'mostly', 'pythons', 'flying', 'shark', 'found', 'niche', 'regret', ""'d"", 'think', '23', 'would', 'have', 'developed', 'sense', 'story', 'then', 'SYFY', 'channel', ""n't"", 'really', 'necessary']",N/A
