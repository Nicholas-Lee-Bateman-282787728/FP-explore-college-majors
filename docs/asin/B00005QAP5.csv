I was expecting a wrestling movie--period. I got much more.I would actually  give this movie a 3.5 stars if I could. This movie was about wrestling, ambition, love, friendship. I have seen this story a thousand times, but never with wrestling's violence as the backdrop. Any fan of pro wrestling and UFC fighting will love this movie. Aside from all the different stories, there is plenty of action for us wrestling fans. I do not understand the bad reviews. But the stories within the story will attract more than wrestling/UFC fans.

It had every thing that makes a bad movie good Action, Sex, And A helluva lot of Great Wrestling Action.In my honest opinion I would like that Today's Backyard Wrestling is far more superior than what the lame WWE could ever come up with.

Poole,"[3, 4]","While most people think of hardcore stupid kids smashing each other with weapons and cutting themselves open for no good reason (thanks so much 20/20 and Oprah for that), the truth is most backyard wrestling groups are well practiced kids that do wrestle hard and have taken at least some pro wrestling training via friends that have gone pro or the various different forms of instruction out there.They wrestle hard, do good shows, and even if they're not budgeted like the WWE or even the regional groups, they do work hard to entertain.Needless to say then, this is a slap in the backyard wrestling world's face, and an embarrassment to those of us who work hard at trying to legitimize the value of this genre.It's one thing to face an attack from panic driven media outlets, it's another when Hollywood tries to make you look bad.Backyard Dogs is just horrendous. Two friends work backyard wrestling groups across the nation to try to make money because they are struggling financially, yet they drive around in hot rod cars and have a website with video streaming. I'm curious why they just don't sell the car.A so-called ""FMW-America"" promoter contacts them for their upcoming PPV. Which is funny in itself because FMW is run out of Japan and FMW PPVs don't even run on American Cable systems, let alone would they do a PPV show in America. Besides when you realize that this promoter makes them wrestle in his backyard with a ring in it as a tryout match, you have to realize how ridiculous that is.Then the PPV itself looks like it's being held in a junkyard! There apparently is no other wrestlers on the show so FMW brings in a backyarder to wrestle the Dogs. Stupid.Hayabusa makes an appearance to try to draw the Japanese Wrestling fan in, but that and the logo are the extent of the real FMW's involvement.Let me set this straight right now: Backyarders do not work for promoters for money and try to get gigs all over the place. That would be called Indy Wrestling. Backyarders stick with who they know and trust usually. The promoter would never call the cops on the show to keep from making a payout because besides the fact that there are NO payouts, the shows are almost always held in the promoter's YARD.Bree Turner is sexy and hot in the movie, and as you can see on imdb.com she has a future in Hollywood. Unfortunately for her, if she happens to really hit it big this footage will be laugh fodder for Leno years down the road.Please don't buy this.",1,Backyard Wrestling Doesn't Deserve This....,1034380800,"10 12, 2002",2002,2473,"['most', 'people', 'think', 'hardcore', 'stupid', 'kids', 'smashing', 'other', 'weapons', 'cutting', 'open', 'good', 'reason', 'thanks', 'so', 'much', '20/20', 'Oprah', 'truth', 'most', 'backyard', 'wrestling', 'groups', 'are', 'well', 'practiced', 'kids', 'do', 'wrestle', 'hard', 'have', 'taken', 'least', 'pro', 'wrestling', 'training', 'friends', 'have', 'gone', 'pro', 'various', 'different', 'forms', 'instruction', 'there.They', 'wrestle', 'hard', 'do', 'good', 'shows', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'budgeted', 'WWE', 'even', 'regional', 'groups', 'do', 'work', 'hard', 'entertain.Needless', 'say', 'then', 'slap', 'backyard', 'wrestling', 'world', 'face', 'embarrassment', 'who', 'work', 'hard', 'trying', 'legitimize', 'value', 'genre.It', 'one', 'thing', 'face', 'attack', 'panic', 'driven', 'media', 'outlets', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'make', 'look', 'bad.Backyard', 'Dogs', 'just', 'horrendous', 'Two', 'friends', 'work', 'backyard', 'wrestling', 'groups', 'nation', 'try', 'make', 'money', 'are', 'struggling', 'financially', 'yet', 'drive', 'hot', 'rod', 'cars', 'have', 'website', 'video', 'streaming', ""'m"", 'curious', 'why', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'sell', 'car.A', 'so-called', 'FMW-America', 'promoter', 'upcoming', 'PPV', 'Which', 'funny', 'FMW', 'run', 'Japan', 'FMW', 'PPVs', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'run', 'American', 'Cable', 'systems', 'let', 'alone', 'would', 'do', 'PPV', 'show', 'America', 'when', 'realize', 'promoter', 'wrestle', 'backyard', 'ring', 'tryout', 'match', 'have', 'realize', 'how', 'ridiculous', 'is.Then', 'PPV', 'being', 'held', 'junkyard', 'apparently', 'other', 'wrestlers', 'show', 'so', 'FMW', 'backyarder', 'wrestle', 'Dogs', 'Stupid.Hayabusa', 'appearance', 'try', 'draw', 'Japanese', 'Wrestling', 'fan', 'logo', 'are', 'extent', 'real', 'FMW', 'involvement.Let', 'set', 'straight', 'right', 'now', 'Backyarders', 'do', 'not', 'work', 'promoters', 'money', 'try', 'get', 'gigs', 'place', 'would', 'be', 'called', 'Indy', 'Wrestling', 'Backyarders', 'stick', 'who', 'know', 'trust', 'usually', 'promoter', 'would', 'never', 'call', 'cops', 'show', 'keep', 'making', 'payout', 'fact', 'are', 'NO', 'payouts', 'shows', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'held', 'promoter', 'YARD.Bree', 'Turner', 'sexy', 'hot', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'imdb.com', 'future', 'Hollywood', 'Unfortunately', 'really', 'hit', 'big', 'footage', 'will', 'be', 'laugh', 'fodder', 'Leno', 'years', 'down', 'road.Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy']",Backyard Dogs

Unfortunatly that was not the case here.  Instead what we have is a fairly seriouse attempt at a sport movie.Backyard DOgs is basically about two college students who are in to the backyard wrestling circuit.  THey hire this blond chick who is in financal trouble because she once owned a porno sight that accidently featured a minor.  So with her cameraman the four of them create this drama around the two wrestlers as tehy travel in the Backyard wrestling circuit in hopes of one day entering into the FWE, or japanese circuit.  Along the way they end up in this violent rivalry (think chief villian) with a man called Voodoo who is this 300lb black man that seems to randomly show up at their matches.  Along the way sexual tension rises as does tempers which leads to a match between the two main characters, however in the end they fullfill their dream and enter into the Japanese circuit.This movie is terrible.  THe whole idea of an organized backyard wrestling circuit that is similar to the territories of the pro leage in the early days is silly (although probably true) and the fact that this huge guy is basically interfering all the time is like a bad WCW storyline (and that is really bad).Overall skip out on this title, there is so much more out there that is better.  Instead of this watch one of these titles instead.1: No Holds Barred (VHS only)2: Kickboxer3: Bloodsport4: RockyThose are so much better",1,"Backyard Wrestling as a movie, might as well be jackass",1051056000,"04 23, 2003",2003,1558,"['nice', 'decided', 'do', 'wrestling', 'movie', 'admit', 'wanted', 'watch', 'just', 'reeked', 'cheese', 'factor', 'Unfortunatly', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'Instead', 'what', 'have', 'fairly', 'seriouse', 'attempt', 'sport', 'movie.Backyard', 'DOgs', 'basically', 'about', 'two', 'college', 'students', 'who', 'are', 'backyard', 'wrestling', 'circuit', 'THey', 'hire', 'blond', 'chick', 'who', 'financal', 'trouble', 'once', 'owned', 'porno', 'sight', 'accidently', 'featured', 'minor', 'So', 'cameraman', 'four', 'create', 'drama', 'two', 'wrestlers', 'tehy', 'travel', 'Backyard', 'wrestling', 'circuit', 'hopes', 'one', 'day', 'entering', 'FWE', 'japanese', 'circuit', 'way', 'end', 'up', 'violent', 'rivalry', 'think', 'chief', 'villian', 'man', 'called', 'Voodoo', 'who', '300lb', 'black', 'man', 'randomly', 'show', 'up', 'matches', 'way', 'sexual', 'tension', 'tempers', 'match', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'however', 'end', 'fullfill', 'dream', 'enter', 'Japanese', 'circuit.This', 'movie', 'terrible', 'THe', 'whole', 'idea', 'organized', 'backyard', 'wrestling', 'circuit', 'similar', 'territories', 'pro', 'leage', 'early', 'days', 'silly', 'probably', 'true', 'fact', 'huge', 'guy', 'basically', 'interfering', 'time', 'bad', 'WCW', 'storyline', 'really', 'bad', '.Overall', 'out', 'title', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'there', 'better', 'Instead', 'watch', 'one', 'titles', 'instead.1', 'Holds', 'Barred', 'VHS', 'only', '2', 'Kickboxer3', 'Bloodsport4', 'RockyThose', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'better']",Backyard Dogs
