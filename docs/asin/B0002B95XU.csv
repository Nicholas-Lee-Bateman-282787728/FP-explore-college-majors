There are three additional episodes that are a re-package of the existing episodes.This is more of an action/adventure series than a sci-fi series. The sci-fi element adds an interesting twist to the story lines. These rangers are based at an outpost in outer space and are tasked with enforcing the law, rescuing people in trouble and keeping peace in their quadrant of space. The characters are somewhat stereotypical of what you'd expect in an action series, but then you're not going to put this on and expect Shakespeare! Linda Hunt is terrific as the outpost commander and there's no shortage of fast moving action in each episode.The overall look of the series is a bit cheesy. It looks like it was shot on videotape and transferred to film. A lot of the visual effects are CGI, which wasn't quite ready for prime time back then. Despite the low budget production values, the show holds up pretty well after 20 years. Good stories and characters never go out of style.I'm very pleased with the quality of the DVD presentation. Mill Creek has released a lot of value packages over the years where you get a lot for your money, but the source material was poor quality. Not the case with this series. It looks as crisp and colorful as it did when it aired 20 years ago. The dialog is a bit low in a Dolby 5.1 mix, but that's a small nit pick. It actually sounds the same on my old tape which was recorded in S-VHS hi-fi off the original broadcast. Kudos to Mill Creek!There are no bonus features, but at $10, who's complaining?

Oh, what a difference a months make, today's blurring-fast yearswill see good and bad series fold as soon as computers say so.Space Rangers was released in 1982 and is remembered as a ""cult series"". The Golden Monkey came out after. And... is not much remembered. No cult status (Cult just means many followers) Stephen Collier was fine but the scripts DOA.I give an all-out enthusiastic five stars to Space Rangers, which iswhy I list them first. To Golden Monkey I give a merciful 3 stars.Space Rangers was 'way ahead of its time in concept, writing, production and cool. While Golden Monkey was churned out by Universal, with a Hollywood ""let's do it again 'cause it worked before old-school mentality'. The G.Monkey was made to mix humor with action (with, sorry, some very corny supposed to be funny ;} writing), while Rangers had more of a Star Trek Attitude in all aspects - writing, creative philosophy,characters and; well, Everything. Thanks again Gene Roddenberry.Back then, Star Trek was mostly shot on sound stages. While Space Rangers did location shoots and hectic/digital space action shots. (Yes,RANGERS too for practicality, shot some in-studio shots, as appropriate).The outcome: Space Rangers is more like today's quality TV (both in productionand viewer sophistication with more complex plots, less-exec-managed scriptsSpace Rangers used outside nature locales (yes, some, tricked out). Hip, quick, real dialogue and more quirky writing like today's fare. That is, real, unchained and smart-funny. Ditto the mutli-layered characters, issues. So plots and action came closer to real, original and quick. Their editing played to those elements as well.Overall, Rangers writing was superb, natural, ahead of the cliches whichso riddled earlier decades. Often funny, too. Not often enough, though.So, to parse out praise, 5-stars to Rangers and 3-stars to Gold Monkey.(And another 5 stars for another ranger - The Lone Ranger Collection I just bought; the original TV series with Clayton Moore. Moore really believed in his masked man and what he represented.Lone Ranger CollectionAlso...I noted,studying the 80's (but enhanced and brought to life) prints, Moore did his own Hi-Ho-ing Silver jump starts and rode very, very well. And did whatever else the Ranger needed to do to be real and risky (...Okay, he didn't really shoot guns outa bad-guys' hands. Probably an insurance issue). Moore's RANGER, B&W; and dated is vastly better than the 2013 Lone Ranger.I gave the 'new' Johnny Depp Lone Ranger movie one star. If you buy it or bought it, look at the deleted scenes and 'making of' selections. Check the credits, this movie was hated by its creators. Eventually, me too.  rc",5,Here comes another 2-fer review : SPACE RANGERS versus TALES OF THE GOLDEN MONKEY,1390435200,"01 23, 2014",2014,2810,"['nostalgia', 'freaks', 'here', 'are', 'two', 'cancelled', 'series', ""'80"", '90', 'droppedin', 'different', 'decades', 'Oh', 'what', 'difference', 'months', 'make', 'today', 'blurring-fast', 'yearswill', 'see', 'good', 'bad', 'series', 'fold', 'as', 'soon', 'computers', 'say', 'so.Space', 'Rangers', 'was', 'released', '1982', 'remembered', 'cult', 'series', 'Golden', 'Monkey', 'came', 'out', 'not', 'much', 'remembered', 'cult', 'status', 'Cult', 'just', 'many', 'followers', 'Stephen', 'Collier', 'was', 'fine', 'scripts', 'DOA.I', 'give', 'all-out', 'enthusiastic', 'five', 'stars', 'Space', 'Rangers', 'iswhy', 'list', 'first', 'Golden', 'Monkey', 'give', 'merciful', '3', 'stars.Space', 'Rangers', 'was', ""'way"", 'ahead', 'time', 'concept', 'writing', 'production', 'cool', 'Golden', 'Monkey', 'was', 'churned', 'out', 'Universal', 'Hollywood', 'let', 'do', 'again', 'worked', 'old-school', 'mentality', 'G.Monkey', 'was', 'made', 'mix', 'humor', 'action', 'sorry', 'very', 'corny', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'writing', 'Rangers', 'had', 'more', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Attitude', 'aspects', 'writing', 'creative', 'philosophy', 'characters', 'well', 'Everything', 'Thanks', 'again', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry.Back', 'then', 'Star', 'Trek', 'was', 'mostly', 'shot', 'sound', 'stages', 'Space', 'Rangers', 'did', 'location', 'shoots', 'hectic/digital', 'space', 'action', 'shots', 'Yes', 'RANGERS', 'too', 'practicality', 'shot', 'in-studio', 'shots', 'appropriate', 'outcome', 'Space', 'Rangers', 'more', 'today', 'quality', 'TV', 'productionand', 'viewer', 'sophistication', 'more', 'complex', 'plots', 'less-exec-managed', 'scriptsSpace', 'Rangers', 'used', 'outside', 'nature', 'locales', 'yes', 'tricked', 'out', 'Hip', 'quick', 'real', 'dialogue', 'more', 'quirky', 'writing', 'today', 'fare', 'real', 'unchained', 'smart-funny', 'Ditto', 'mutli-layered', 'characters', 'issues', 'So', 'plots', 'action', 'came', 'closer', 'real', 'original', 'quick', 'editing', 'played', 'elements', 'well.Overall', 'Rangers', 'writing', 'was', 'superb', 'natural', 'ahead', 'cliches', 'whichso', 'riddled', 'earlier', 'decades', 'Often', 'funny', 'too', 'Not', 'often', 'enough', 'though.So', 'parse', 'out', 'praise', '5-stars', 'Rangers', '3-stars', 'Gold', 'Monkey', '5', 'stars', 'ranger', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'Collection', 'just', 'bought', 'original', 'TV', 'series', 'Clayton', 'Moore', 'Moore', 'really', 'believed', 'masked', 'man', 'what', 'represented.Lone', 'Ranger', 'CollectionAlso', 'noted', 'studying', '80', 'enhanced', 'brought', 'life', 'prints', 'Moore', 'did', 'own', 'Hi-Ho-ing', 'Silver', 'jump', 'starts', 'rode', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'did', 'else', 'Ranger', 'needed', 'do', 'be', 'real', 'risky', 'Okay', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'shoot', 'guns', 'bad-guys', 'hands', 'Probably', 'insurance', 'issue', 'Moore', 'RANGER', 'B', 'W', 'dated', 'vastly', 'better', '2013', 'Lone', 'Ranger.I', 'gave', ""'new"", 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'movie', 'one', 'star', 'buy', 'bought', 'look', 'deleted', 'scenes', ""'making"", 'selections', 'Check', 'credits', 'movie', 'was', 'hated', 'creators', 'Eventually', 'too', 'rc']",Space Rangers

They look terrible, and my collection was incomplete.  I figured that was a piece of sci fi history that would remain incomplete.  I know there were a lot of sci fi fanatics like me out there who felt the same--and so did some company that finally went ahead and made this show available on DVD after all these years!!Amazingly, this show holds up pretty well, too!  I was ready to soak of the nostalgia and probably do a lot of cringing while watching, too.  Not so!  I have watched through the first half of the episodes so far, and I have found them totally enjoyable.  It's no Babylon 5.  It's episodic, network sci fi TV from back in the day. It was made to be a fun romp in space with action and some cool sci fi ideas.  The effects are top notch for the day it was produced.  And, it's probably about as great as you remember it!People who are not in their 40's and can't remember when this show was aired and have not pined away over the years wondering if it would ever be released may not find this as enjoyable as I did--they might, but I am less likely to best represent folks who have never seen this before.
