Her last three films including ""The Secret Garden"", have been about children and their secrets, and this one is no exception.  It is a very odd film about a very dysfunctional family, on a sexual level.  There is incest on the mother's part.",4,no title,1140825600,"02 25, 2006",2006,361,"['Not', 'same', 'class', 'excellent', 'Angry', 'Harvest', 'Europa', 'Europa', 'would', 'seem', 'double', 'titles', 'last', 'three', 'films', 'including', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'have', 'been', 'children', 'secrets', 'one', 'exception', 'very', 'odd', 'film', 'very', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'sexual', 'level', 'incest', 'mother', 'part']",Olivier Olivier VHS

The ending has a great  twist and the first time i saw it i screamed. definately worth catching.",5,little red ridinghood's disfunctional family,958694400,"05 19, 2000",2000,819,"['i', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'bad', 'french', 'films', 'exist', 'best', 'example', 'movie', 'fear', 'abandonment', 'need', 'closure', 'lives', 'pastoral', 'setting', 'film', 'barely', 'disfunctions', 'exist', 'main', 'characters', 'even', 'mystery', 'not', 'street', 'urchin', 'missing', 'link', 'family', 'fell', 'apart', 'little', 'Olivier', 'disappeared', 'nine', 'years', 'ago', 'story', 'beautiful', 'haunting', 'watch', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'enough', 'keep', 'story', 'moving', 'neurotic', 'obsessive', 'mother', 'father', 'who', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'too', 'hard', 'daughter', 'who', 'caught', 'middle', 'always', 'idly', 'pushed', 'aside', 'ending', 'great', 'twist', 'first', 'time', 'i', 'saw', 'screamed', 'definately', 'worth', 'catching']",Olivier Olivier VHS
351279,A1WGF3DAX2WUV0,6303023045,Michael Dyckman,"[0, 0]","Interesting and slightly odd film about a son who disappears from his French family. He has a somewhat Oedipal relationship with his mother, and the family is very dysfunctional. Years later, he returns, but questions are raised if he is the real young man. The family drama is good and well-acted, but contains some truly bizarre subplots, such as the daughter's ability to levitate objects. The film also leaves some major perplexing questions regarding the boy, which I will not reveal. Nevertheless, an interesting and different film.",3,Interesting French Drama,970185600,"09 29, 2000",2000,538,"['Interesting', 'slightly', 'odd', 'film', 'son', 'who', 'French', 'family', 'somewhat', 'Oedipal', 'relationship', 'mother', 'family', 'very', 'dysfunctional', 'Years', 'later', 'questions', 'are', 'raised', 'real', 'young', 'man', 'family', 'drama', 'good', 'well-acted', 'truly', 'bizarre', 'subplots', 'such', 'daughter', 'ability', 'levitate', 'objects', 'film', 'also', 'major', 'perplexing', 'questions', 'regarding', 'boy', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'Nevertheless', 'interesting', 'different', 'film']",Olivier Olivier VHS
