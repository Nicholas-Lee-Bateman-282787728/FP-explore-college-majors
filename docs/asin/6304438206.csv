This movie shows Jackie's acting ability... he can be dramatic and serious, not just a loveable clown. There are many comedies you can choose from in his long list of movies; there are fewer when you try to find a broader range of his impressive acting abilities which is wider in scope than many might expect. As other reviewers have covered the story itself, I'm just going to add a few words here. Now, Jackie took this part because Jet Li walked out on it and Jackie happened to walk into the director's office right after this happened. So, being a pal, he offered himself in Jet's place. Or so I understand the history behind it. Don't let the fact that is in not a comedic venture steer you from this gem of a movie; it is a fantastic piece filled with drama and action. We still get to see Jackie's trademark and inimitable body work in this film. It is a GOOD movie. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. And if you like his dramatic acting, check out Thunderbolt (awesome) and Heart of Dragon (very good and touching). Yes, folks, Jackie is a REAL actor, he has depth and scope, he is dynamic. Don't make the mistake of pidgeon-holing him into one static dimension. It'll be your loss.",5,Not funny...

Wilson ""SonRisedInTheEast""","[1, 1]","Supposedly based on true events, Crime Story puts Jackie Chan in his usual hero cop role against a group of criminals and their kidnapping scheme.  Unlike his Police Story movies, this film plays it straight with an emphasis on realism and drama over martial arts and stunts.  Missing here are any of Jackies usual over the top antics and absolutely none of his humor or charm.  It's interesting to see Jackie play this stiff of a role and he does a fine job but I'm not sure why you would ever cast him to be this bland.  I guess they wanted to differentiate this from the Police Story films (he goes by Eddie Chan here rather than his real name like in Police Story 1 & 2)but I for one yearned for those pictures while watching this (in fact it forced me to rethink my original rating on Police Story 2 to 4 stars instead of 3).  This is still worth catching once at least... and who knows, maybe I'm missing something that the other reviewers are seeing?  If you always wanted to see what Chan's career would have been like if he wasn't one of the greatest martial artists ever this is for you... for those who watch Chan movies for unique fights and exhilerating stunts you'll have to go elsewhere.

If you only like him for crazy kung fu and comedy, then don't see this movie.  Very little of either.  Jackie gives an excellent performance for which he won the Golden Horse Best Actor Award from Taiwan.  He plays a police officer almost on the verge of a nervous breakdown, who is obsessed with finding a kidnap victim before he is killed.  His efforts are hampered by his partner, who has actually arranged the kidnapping!  The ending in the burning building is great.

422233,A3CFNVFTZHONG9,6304438206,"J. N. K ""Esco""","[2, 6]","I will admit, I watch Jackie Chan movies for two (plus one) reasons, and I am almost entirely watching them one by one at the times.  What do I mean by that?  The three reasons I watch Jackie Chan is: the charm of his character, the slapstick, and the incredible martial arts; for my previous statement, let us simply focus on the slapstick and martial arts.  What I meant by my earlier statement was that when I watch the fight scenes, I commonly watch them over because the first time I was too busy admiring his moves and laughing at the slapstick to care about the content of the fight in itself.  The second time I watch it, it's to pretend I'm Jackie, and the people I don't like are the baddies who're getting beaten up.This movie takes care of the first viewings for me in the most effective way possible: making it for the most part nonexistant.  While laughing at Drunken Master II, all I can do ussually is feel it being a good thing to see many evil men having their faces smashed and bodies tumbled upon each other; they are built up in which their characters deserve nothing better!  Crime Story fits in that category, and while satisfying, it is far inferior to Drunken Master II in that respect.How is Crime Story a movie that in some ways works and some ways doesn't?  The reason it works is that it tells a very gritty crime story (no stupid remark intended) extreamly well.  Director Kirk Wong clearly knows his stuff, and if you are unsure throughout the movie as you watch it, wait and watch closely the scene in which Jackie Chan and Detective Hung lead a search on the criminals' ship outside of the city.  The lighting and wind and water-dripping effects are used to incredible effects.  However, the reasons why these didn't quite work was the lack of satisfaction by which these despicable villains were taken out.  The sickest one who hit Jackie with a few solid hits ran off, and Jackie shot him a couple of times later.The only thing I could think of to say was: &quot;Hey, that's It?!&quot;  Police Stories 1 &amp; 2 were less gritty, yet the enemies were ussually taken out in an incredibly satisfying way.  One of the big villains in Police Story 2 (which for SOME REASON isn't out on DVD yet!!!) was picked up by Jackie Chan on the second floor of a warehouse, and thrown out the window, where he slid down a giant sign made up of many neon lights.  Now THAT is a satisfying way to take out a villain!  Shooting him and him quickly dying is just too weak, I'm sorry.Maybe I didn't talk about the movie and break it down enough in my long review, but I do personally believe that my main point is enough to stress everything that should decide wheather you'd love or hate this movie.  While I liked it, it was like a different part of my mind liking it, which wasn't necessarily a good thing.  However, I still enjoyed the movie immensely, as it showed a more mature and darker side of Jackie Chan, as well as a more acting side as well.",4,A Successful &quot;Port&quot; of Jackie Chan Across the Genre Gap,1005177600,"11 8, 2001",2001,2969,"['will', 'admit', 'watch', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'movies', 'two', 'one', 'reasons', 'am', 'almost', 'entirely', 'watching', 'one', 'one', 'times', 'What', 'do', 'mean', 'three', 'reasons', 'watch', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'charm', 'character', 'slapstick', 'incredible', 'martial', 'arts', 'previous', 'statement', 'let', 'simply', 'focus', 'slapstick', 'martial', 'arts', 'What', 'meant', 'earlier', 'statement', 'was', 'when', 'watch', 'fight', 'scenes', 'commonly', 'watch', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'too', 'busy', 'admiring', 'moves', 'laughing', 'slapstick', 'care', 'content', 'fight', 'second', 'time', 'watch', 'pretend', ""'m"", 'Jackie', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'are', 'baddies', 'who', ""'re"", 'getting', 'beaten', 'up.This', 'movie', 'care', 'first', 'viewings', 'most', 'effective', 'way', 'possible', 'making', 'most', 'part', 'nonexistant', 'laughing', 'Drunken', 'Master', 'II', 'can', 'do', 'ussually', 'feel', 'being', 'good', 'thing', 'see', 'many', 'evil', 'men', 'having', 'smashed', 'bodies', 'tumbled', 'other', 'are', 'built', 'up', 'characters', 'deserve', 'nothing', 'better', 'Crime', 'Story', 'fits', 'category', 'satisfying', 'far', 'inferior', 'Drunken', 'Master', 'II', 'respect.How', 'Crime', 'Story', 'movie', 'ways', 'works', 'ways', ""n't"", 'reason', 'very', 'gritty', 'crime', 'story', 'stupid', 'remark', 'intended', 'extreamly', 'well', 'Director', 'Kirk', 'Wong', 'clearly', 'stuff', 'are', 'unsure', 'movie', 'watch', 'wait', 'watch', 'closely', 'scene', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Detective', 'Hung', 'lead', 'search', 'criminals', 'ship', 'city', 'lighting', 'wind', 'water-dripping', 'effects', 'are', 'used', 'incredible', 'effects', 'However', 'reasons', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'was', 'lack', 'satisfaction', 'despicable', 'villains', 'were', 'taken', 'out', 'sickest', 'one', 'who', 'hit', 'Jackie', 'few', 'solid', 'hits', 'ran', 'off', 'Jackie', 'shot', 'couple', 'times', 'later.The', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'think', 'say', 'was', 'quot', 'Hey', 'quot', 'Police', 'Stories', '1', 'amp', '2', 'were', 'less', 'gritty', 'yet', 'enemies', 'were', 'ussually', 'taken', 'out', 'incredibly', 'satisfying', 'way', 'One', 'big', 'villains', 'Police', 'Story', '2', 'SOME', 'REASON', ""n't"", 'out', 'DVD', 'yet', 'was', 'picked', 'up', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'second', 'floor', 'warehouse', 'thrown', 'out', 'window', 'where', 'slid', 'down', 'giant', 'sign', 'made', 'many', 'neon', 'lights', 'Now', 'THAT', 'satisfying', 'way', 'take', 'out', 'villain', 'Shooting', 'quickly', 'dying', 'just', 'too', 'weak', ""'m"", 'sorry.Maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'talk', 'movie', 'break', 'down', 'enough', 'long', 'review', 'do', 'personally', 'believe', 'main', 'point', 'enough', 'stress', 'everything', 'should', 'decide', 'wheather', ""'d"", 'love', 'hate', 'movie', 'liked', 'was', 'different', 'part', 'mind', 'liking', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'good', 'thing', 'However', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'immensely', 'showed', 'more', 'mature', 'darker', 'side', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'acting', 'side', 'as', 'well']",Crime Story VHS

422236,APIW11UEPKIC2,6304438206,"morgoth ""we lamas are traditional enemies of ...","[1, 1]","I have to admit that this movie blew my mind.  Jackie has to be one of the all time toughest looking actors in cinema history.  He usually jokes around 99% of the time and sometimes gets to shows real acting but this movie shows you just how good Jackie can be when he plays it serious all the way through.  He is a bad man!  He never gives up and will always make sure that if you are a bad guy, YOU ARE GOING DOWN!Kent Cheng plays the main supporting character and I was surprised by how good he was.  It is hard to get over how fat and stupid he looks but he is a very good actor and definitely helps this movie out.  His character could have had more depth but it is still acceptable.This story is about mobsters and a bad cop who team up to kidnap a man for ransom.  Well, with Jackie here these people are going down for sure.The fights are not exactly plentiful but there is more than enough action with a few bursts of really good fights and outstanding shootouts.  The stunt work is also absolutely top notch(as always with Jackie) and it looks very realistic.  I really can't say enough good things about this movie.  Get this movie today and strap yourself in for one of the best Hong Kong action thrillers ever made!  It is not perfect and I was stuck in between a 4 and a 5 but it is easily good enough to give this movie the highest rating.The version of this movie that I have is from Dimension.  Of course Dimension is the company that dubbed, cut-up, and rescored all of Jackie's and Jet's good movies.  This movie is not cut very much though.  There is a speech after the opening credits is cut out and also a lady giving thanks to Jackie.  Other than that this movie is fully intact.  Great picture quality but the music doesn't sound right but I can't remember for sure from when I saw the original version.

The year before (1985), Jackie had been involved in another police drama, a terrible film called The Protector.  Although Jackie was the protagonist in The Protector, he was not a likeable character.  In fact, there were no likeable characters.  In addition, the action sequences, which could have been good, were poorly filmed and much of the visual impact was lost due to poor camera work.In Crime Story, Jackie seems to be out to prove he can do a gritty drama properly.  Although his character isn't a goofy, affable fellow, he is certainly likeable.  He plays a police officer on the verge of a nervous breakdown, after he killed some criminals in the line of duty.He's hired on for a high-profile case when a construction magnate is kidnapped.  Jackie's tension and anguish grows more and more, as other police officers are killed or seriously injured during the course of the case.  These scenes show Jackie is capable of more than just goofy gurning, and I understand why this film garnered Jackie the Golden Horse Best Actor Award from Taiwan.The camera work is vastly superior to that of The Protector, and tense fight scenes upon a derelict ship and inside a burning building (the latter scene bore a heavy influence upon John Woo's Hard Boiled) work very well.All in all, the story makes sense, except for a ridiculous part in which the bad guys resuscitate a woman with their car's jumper cables.  I once saw a really bad vampire movie where this trick worked, but something tells me it just shouldn't be used in serious films, at least, not the way it was used in Crime Story.If you like to watch Jackie Chan for his comedy, skip Crime Story.  He only slips into comic relief mode a couple of times in this film.  However, if you would like to see a decent cops n' robbers flick, check this out.",4,The Protector done properly,1010880000,"01 13, 2002",2002,1871,"['Crime', 'Story', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'drama', 'well', 'year', '1985', 'Jackie', 'had', 'been', 'involved', 'police', 'drama', 'terrible', 'film', 'called', 'Protector', 'Jackie', 'was', 'protagonist', 'Protector', 'was', 'not', 'likeable', 'character', 'fact', 'were', 'likeable', 'characters', 'addition', 'action', 'sequences', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'were', 'poorly', 'filmed', 'much', 'visual', 'impact', 'was', 'lost', 'due', 'poor', 'camera', 'work.In', 'Crime', 'Story', 'Jackie', 'be', 'out', 'prove', 'can', 'do', 'gritty', 'drama', 'properly', 'character', ""n't"", 'goofy', 'affable', 'fellow', 'certainly', 'likeable', 'police', 'officer', 'verge', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'killed', 'criminals', 'line', 'duty.He', 'hired', 'high-profile', 'case', 'when', 'construction', 'magnate', 'kidnapped', 'Jackie', 'tension', 'anguish', 'grows', 'more', 'more', 'other', 'police', 'officers', 'are', 'killed', 'seriously', 'injured', 'course', 'case', 'scenes', 'show', 'Jackie', 'capable', 'more', 'just', 'goofy', 'gurning', 'understand', 'why', 'film', 'garnered', 'Jackie', 'Golden', 'Horse', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Award', 'Taiwan.The', 'camera', 'work', 'vastly', 'superior', 'Protector', 'tense', 'fight', 'scenes', 'derelict', 'ship', 'burning', 'building', 'latter', 'scene', 'bore', 'heavy', 'influence', 'John', 'Woo', 'Hard', 'Boiled', 'work', 'very', 'well.All', 'story', 'sense', 'ridiculous', 'part', 'bad', 'guys', 'resuscitate', 'woman', 'car', 'jumper', 'cables', 'once', 'saw', 'really', 'bad', 'vampire', 'movie', 'where', 'trick', 'worked', 'something', 'tells', 'just', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'used', 'serious', 'films', 'least', 'not', 'way', 'was', 'used', 'Crime', 'Story.If', 'like', 'watch', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'comedy', 'skip', 'Crime', 'Story', 'only', 'comic', 'relief', 'mode', 'couple', 'times', 'film', 'However', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'decent', 'cops', 'n', 'robbers', 'flick', 'check', 'out']",Crime Story VHS
