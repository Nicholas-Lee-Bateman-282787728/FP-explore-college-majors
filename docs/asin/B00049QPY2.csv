It's great because it allows you to see not only how the crime was committed, but the process that law enforcement had to go through to solve the crime.I love these shows because somehow it makes me feel safer just knowing that every crime can be solved - plus, I'm also extremely interested in forensic science, as well as what drives people to commit such horrible crimes against others.""Forensic Files"" is great because you're never left hanging - you know going into it that the ""bad guy"" will be caught.
