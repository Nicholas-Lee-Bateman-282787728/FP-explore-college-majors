1378916,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B00405L2D0,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[7, 8]","Answering the age-old question, ""What happens to former West Hollywood gay party boys when they start approaching age 40?"" (Personally, I always thought some kind of spontaneous combustion was involved...), ""Pooltime"" (2010) is a pleasant but lightweight romantic comedy that looks into what a midlife crisis feels like, surrounded by a community and town that is youth obsessed.David is a successful, handsome, buff man in his late 30's, who comes to realize he is missing what he really wants: a stable, lasting relationship with a nice guy. Thinking of missed opportunities, he throws a small pool party for three of his closest (and equally attractive) friends near his age, to see if he notices some mutual interest or a relationship sparks. Of course, his plans don't go smoothly, as they are interrupted by the mother of one of his guests, his sister who wants him to babysit his nephew, a couple of straight neighbors, and a pizza boy who delivers some really bad timing.Not that much of a plot here, but some interesting characters that many gay men (even those of us who don't live in WeHo) may find familiar, and perhaps a bit disturbing on some level.  Kudos to Michael Donahue (writer/director) for having the courage to release a film with fully-nuanced older gay characters, played by capable age-appropriate actors.

1378917,A1WKLEZDNS2TI8,B00405L2D0,Desert Dave,"[0, 0]",it was an interesting study on how two opposites can attract. It was fascinating how they had the guys nude so often in the movie but managed to avoid frontal shots. It was well written since the subject matter could have easily become a comedy or too deep in the philosophy of the conflicts of the gay activist vs the closeted movie star. The title and cover do not really relate to the movie other than the fact the setting in a PS Gay hotel with a pool in the middle.

The directing was lacking as well. I would say the actors did a better job then the director...okay most of the actors did a better job then the director.

You have to overlook somethings but if you can tune in to the scenery and what the director is trying to bring across I think you will be surprised.

That's right, his relationships were so shallow that the depths of judgment found at an afternoon pool dip could change his mind. Presumably, they've been alone at home waiting for however long. This guy's big head also thinks that his choice will inevitably heel when informed. Multiply this gem of a catch by a couple of pals as overly impressed with their worth as he.The bored camera stares at body parts while their listless chatter substitutes for a background of funky 70's porn synth. These characters of average looks and below-average wit are presumed enough to entice our interest. Most people have average looks, and most can tell confidence from denial. As for wit, if camp is no longer the bright and bitter scourge of prejudice but, instead, the splintered, green switch recited here, then return the guilty to the closet and strike them from the lists for recruitment.When Oscar Wilde's farces are played seriously audiences laugh.

1378923,A1ADZQOL0PLBEW,B00405L2D0,Scadhog,"[1, 2]","Remarkably unfunny comedy about shallow, commitment-phobic gay guy David who suddenly realizes he is forty and doesn't want to be alone.  So he invites three of his equally shallow, commitment-phobic gay friends for a late summer pool party, where they frolic by the poolside, splash in the water and talk about sex (eagerly) and commitment (scathingly).  Of course their fun is interrupted by all sorts of zany characters:  nosy neighbors, interfering mothers, pizza delivery boys, obnoxious sisters and pre-pubescent nephews.  A sorrier bunch of men, make that children, never existed.  The best line comes when David gives his nephew some sage advice:  ""Don't be in a hurry to grow up.""  That pretty much sums up David and his friends.A movie doesn't necessarily need characters you care about, but it should have characters you're interested in, and this one doesn't.
