1641605,AAPT0IT4F8ABH,B00C2YBR9U,Matthew Scott Baker,"[0, 1]","Before I start this review, I must state that this film is a low-budget anthology.  Some of my readers have expressed an instant dislike for low-budget horror flicks, so if this is you, feel free to stop reading now.  But if you are like me and enjoy the creativity and determination that smaller films can bring, please continue on.  ROAD HELL, while far from perfect, is a mildly entertaining jaunt that many people will enjoy.The vision that these three filmmakers had in mind when they started putting ROAD HELL together is not very evident in the execution of the film, but thankfully it is still fun to watch for the most part.  I like the premise, how the primary story is accented with the other three tales.  And some of the acting is pretty good, too, although much of it does leave a lot to be desired.ROAD HELL is shot pretty well overall and looks good for the most part.  It is definitely low budget and that is reinforced with spotty sound and low-lit scenes.  But the production crew does a heck of a job with what they have to work with.The special effects are both hit and miss.  The hits come from the gore.  I am impressed with some of the carnage the special effects team was able to conjure up.  But the misses come from the second segment where a tiger is involved.  The practical effects for the tiger look like a joke and the CG portion reminds me of early Nintendo days.  I have to confess that when the tiger was revealed, my interest in the story was almost completely lost.But don't watch ROAD HELL for the special effects...instead, watch it for the colorful characters.  Granted, the acting is very bad in many cases, but there are a couple of folks that shine through, including John Link who portrays the warped hotel owner Dickey Sussex.  Link does a great job with his role and relishes every minute of it.  For a guy whose IMDB page reads like a B-grade porn movie checklist, Link shows a lot of talent in this one.ROAD HELL will certainly not be for everyone, but I kinda liked it.  It's not perfect, but look past its shortcomings and you might just have a good time.  The film hits store shelves next week.",3,B-grade horror flick with some decent gore...,1373328000,"07 9, 2013",2013,2145,"['start', 'review', 'must', 'state', 'film', 'low-budget', 'anthology', 'readers', 'have', 'expressed', 'instant', 'dislike', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'flicks', 'so', 'feel', 'free', 'stop', 'reading', 'now', 'are', 'enjoy', 'creativity', 'determination', 'smaller', 'films', 'can', 'bring', 'please', 'continue', 'ROAD', 'HELL', 'far', 'perfect', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'jaunt', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'enjoy.The', 'vision', 'three', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'mind', 'when', 'started', 'putting', 'ROAD', 'HELL', 'together', 'not', 'very', 'evident', 'execution', 'film', 'thankfully', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'most', 'part', 'premise', 'how', 'primary', 'story', 'accented', 'other', 'three', 'tales', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'much', 'leave', 'lot', 'be', 'desired.ROAD', 'HELL', 'shot', 'pretty', 'well', 'overall', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'definitely', 'low', 'budget', 'reinforced', 'spotty', 'sound', 'low-lit', 'scenes', 'production', 'crew', 'heck', 'job', 'what', 'have', 'work', 'with.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'hit', 'miss', 'hits', 'come', 'gore', 'am', 'impressed', 'carnage', 'special', 'effects', 'team', 'was', 'able', 'conjure', 'up', 'misses', 'come', 'second', 'segment', 'where', 'tiger', 'involved', 'practical', 'effects', 'tiger', 'look', 'joke', 'CG', 'portion', 'early', 'Nintendo', 'days', 'have', 'confess', 'when', 'tiger', 'was', 'revealed', 'interest', 'story', 'was', 'almost', 'completely', 'lost.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'ROAD', 'HELL', 'special', 'effects', 'instead', 'watch', 'colorful', 'characters', 'Granted', 'acting', 'very', 'bad', 'many', 'cases', 'are', 'couple', 'folks', 'shine', 'including', 'John', 'Link', 'who', 'warped', 'hotel', 'owner', 'Dickey', 'Sussex', 'Link', 'great', 'job', 'role', 'relishes', 'minute', 'guy', 'IMDB', 'page', 'reads', 'B-grade', 'porn', 'movie', 'checklist', 'Link', 'lot', 'talent', 'one.ROAD', 'HELL', 'will', 'certainly', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'kinda', 'liked', 'not', 'perfect', 'look', 'shortcomings', 'might', 'just', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'film', 'store', 'shelves', 'week']",N/A
