1375502,AKZGOBZGR1WA3,B003Y5HWEU,A.K.A. Me,"[34, 34]","I can't say that I'm a fan of other FX network shows, as I just don't have any interest in the premise of It's Always Sunny, Sons of Anarchy, et al, but I am a BIG fan of other major shows on cable networks, such as Burn Notice, White Collar, Leverage and Memphis Blues. And I think that Terriers is every bit as good. It's nice to see a role that Donal Logue can develop over time, as he is a far better actor than most of his big screen roles have allowed the public to see (or at least this part of the public). Character-driven shows like this are always far more interesting to me than their wrap-it-up-in-one-episode counterparts. The ensemble in this show is outstanding, the chemistry between the two main characters is very believable, and the writing is excellent.I think the debut of Terriers needed more publicity to begin with, and then it suffered further from the contract dispute between FX and DishTV. I'd really like to see FX give fans a chance to catch up on the episodes we missed, followed by a second, well publicized season. Given the chance, I am sure that other fans of cable programming will come to love this show as much as I have.FX is currently thinking about canceling Terriers. If you are also a fan, PLEASE go to the FX website and post in the Terriers forum that you don't want FX to cancel this show. And if you are not yet a fan, give it a chance, I think you may get ""bitten"" too.UPDATE: 12.27.10: FX has decided not to renew Terriers despite its top ten new show status on imdb, and despite its passionate and ever-growing fan base. This is a GREAT show. If you are a fan PLEASE go to The official website at [...] and post in the community forum. There is so little intelligent television, let's see if we can save this small part of it.",5,Here's hoping FX has the persistence of a Terrier...,1288569600,"11 1, 2010",2010,1777,"['ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""'m"", 'fan', 'other', 'FX', 'network', 'shows', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'interest', 'premise', 'Always', 'Sunny', 'Sons', 'Anarchy', 'et', 'al', 'am', 'BIG', 'fan', 'other', 'major', 'shows', 'cable', 'networks', 'such', 'Burn', 'Notice', 'White', 'Collar', 'Leverage', 'Memphis', 'Blues', 'think', 'Terriers', 'bit', 'good', 'nice', 'see', 'role', 'Donal', 'Logue', 'can', 'develop', 'time', 'far', 'better', 'actor', 'most', 'big', 'screen', 'roles', 'have', 'allowed', 'public', 'see', 'least', 'part', 'public', 'Character-driven', 'shows', 'are', 'always', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'wrap-it-up-in-one-episode', 'counterparts', 'ensemble', 'show', 'outstanding', 'chemistry', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'very', 'believable', 'writing', 'excellent.I', 'think', 'debut', 'Terriers', 'needed', 'more', 'publicity', 'begin', 'then', 'suffered', 'further', 'contract', 'dispute', 'FX', 'DishTV', ""'d"", 'really', 'like', 'see', 'FX', 'give', 'fans', 'chance', 'catch', 'up', 'episodes', 'missed', 'followed', 'second', 'well', 'publicized', 'season', 'Given', 'chance', 'am', 'sure', 'other', 'fans', 'cable', 'programming', 'will', 'come', 'love', 'show', 'as', 'much', 'have.FX', 'currently', 'thinking', 'canceling', 'Terriers', 'are', 'also', 'fan', 'PLEASE', 'go', 'FX', 'website', 'post', 'Terriers', 'forum', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'FX', 'cancel', 'show', 'are', 'not', 'yet', 'fan', 'give', 'chance', 'think', 'may', 'get', 'bitten', 'too.UPDATE', '12.27.10', 'FX', 'decided', 'not', 'renew', 'Terriers', 'top', 'ten', 'new', 'show', 'status', 'imdb', 'passionate', 'ever-growing', 'fan', 'base', 'GREAT', 'show', 'are', 'fan', 'PLEASE', 'go', 'official', 'website', '[', ']', 'post', 'community', 'forum', 'so', 'little', 'intelligent', 'television', 'let', 'see', 'can', 'save', 'small', 'part']",N/A

It was one of very few shows I've ever watched where I'd be glued to the set with my mouth hanging open waiting to see what those two guys would do or say next - and I was never disappointed.  What an amazing experience it was to watch this show.  Now, where the heck is the DVD set?  Please don't leave all of the fans waiting around forever for a DVD release that will never come - like with The Inside.  I've been waiting for that one since it went off the air, as well.  Maybe Fox could put together a Tim Minear DVD compilation set that would include Terriers, The Inside and Drive.
