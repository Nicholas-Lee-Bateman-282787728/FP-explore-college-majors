976851,APTDOKDDZQXKT,B000EQ5UFU,"AM ""AM""","[1, 1]","Hegemonic masculinity and violence definitely runs rampant in this series; that being said, this anime is obviously not for young viewers. The main character's mother is a bit on the nut-so side, the father isn't too far behind, and the person on the front of the box there is supposed to be 13-years-old. Judging from all of those things it should be pretty obvious that this is not a brain food anime. It's, more or less, fighting, fighting, and more fighting. When I bought this series I went in expecting as much and therefore was not disappointed. I was actually very pleased with this purchase.The best advice that I can give you is that if you don't mind watching something that's like a UFC/Mortal Combat hybrid saturated in extremely heavy `WTF' overtones (for lack of a better example), then this is the anime for you. If you're looking for something that you can seriously watch and evaluate for ""deeper meanings"" and that has a ""grade 'A' plot"", then don't even bother. It's a fighting anime; nothing more, nothing less. So don't go in expecting to see much more than that or you'll have otherwise wasted both your time and your money.",4,Make sure you understand what you're buying/thinking about buying,1215648000,"07 10, 2008",2008,1147,"['Hegemonic', 'masculinity', 'violence', 'definitely', 'rampant', 'series', 'being', 'said', 'anime', 'obviously', 'not', 'young', 'viewers', 'main', 'character', 'mother', 'bit', 'nut-so', 'side', 'father', ""n't"", 'too', 'far', 'person', 'front', 'box', 'supposed', 'be', '13-years-old', 'Judging', 'things', 'should', 'be', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'not', 'brain', 'food', 'anime', 'more', 'less', 'fighting', 'fighting', 'more', 'fighting', 'When', 'bought', 'series', 'went', 'expecting', 'as', 'much', 'therefore', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'pleased', 'purchase.The', 'best', 'advice', 'can', 'give', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'something', 'UFC/Mortal', 'Combat', 'hybrid', 'saturated', 'extremely', 'heavy', 'WTF', 'overtones', 'lack', 'better', 'example', 'then', 'anime', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'can', 'seriously', 'watch', 'evaluate', 'deeper', 'meanings', 'grade', 'A', 'plot', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'fighting', 'anime', 'nothing', 'more', 'nothing', 'less', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'see', 'much', 'more', ""'ll"", 'have', 'otherwise', 'wasted', 'time', 'money']",Baki the Grappler:: Season 1
