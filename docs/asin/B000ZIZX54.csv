It's not that I didn't like it as it was entertaining, it's just the 'babyfication' of the show kinda made it less appealing to me. Most of the time, I'd figure out the mystery long before it ever got started. I imagine it was the producers' intentions to gear this more towards the younger set to  get them into Scooby Doo and, in that respect, they achieved what they set out to do. I just didn't care too much for it.However, do I recommend this DVD set to everyone? Quite simply, yes. For what it is, it is a good show.  I agree, there are some areas of the DVD transfer that left the animation sketchy. It should be clearer than it is. But, overall, it's definitely worth recommending.The best way to describe this show to you is simply this...A Pup Named Scooby-Doo is a re-imagining of the series inspired by the classic cartoons of Tex Avery and Bob Clampett, and even Looney Tunes. For the most part, it works. It was a success when it aired from 1988 to 1991 on ABC Saturday Mornings.

1122630,AM6SOTOKGRZGA,B000ZIZX54,Jerry McDaniel,"[7, 7]","This version of Scooby and the gang is a series i watched on Saturday morning TV and i liked it. Shaggy would often serve as the narrator at the start of each episode, usually ending his monologue inserting the name of the series. For example: ""...things aren't usually what they seem to me and a pup named Scooby-Doo..."" and then that episode's story would begin. On hand for the show were Don Messick and Casey Kasem as the voices of Scooby and Shaggy respectively. I always got a kick out the running gag's on the show where Daphne would almost always call out for her butler in a time of crisis and sure enough, her butler would appear out of nowhere. Velma had few lines on the series...usually saying only her catchphrase of ""jinkies"". Her eye glasses were exaggerated. Fred was written more of a know it all who didn't really know it all...usually blaming high school bully Red Herring as the criminal in each mystery. The facial expressions were more along the lines of Tex Avery and Bob Clampette where one would see bulging eyes and tongues gyrating around and outrageous screams. The series ran on ABC-TV from 1988-1991 and re-ran on ABC mornings until around 1992/1993. It didn't have a long re-run life on the network. This DVD has a better packaging...when i opened the DVD i was happy to see the two DVD's on a what i call a flip-flapper. You don't have to pull a DVD out to get to another one, which is often the case in many DVD sets where DVD's over-lap one another. These DVD's are on these flappers much like in the THUNDERCATS collections. If you have those collections you'll know what i'm talking about. Anyway, each episode is crammed with visual gags and comedy...and it is also the last Scooby series to air on one of the big three networks. After this version left the airwaves in 1992/1993 there wouldn't be another new Scooby program in first-run production until 2002's WHAT's NEW, SCOOBY-DOO and that series was on the WB network, not one of the big three: ABC, CBS, NBC.",5,Scooby Doobie Puppy,1206316800,"03 24, 2008",2008,2002,"['version', 'Scooby', 'gang', 'series', 'i', 'watched', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'TV', 'i', 'liked', 'Shaggy', 'would', 'often', 'serve', 'narrator', 'start', 'episode', 'usually', 'ending', 'monologue', 'inserting', 'name', 'series', 'example', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'usually', 'what', 'seem', 'pup', 'named', 'Scooby-Doo', 'then', 'episode', 'story', 'would', 'begin', 'hand', 'show', 'were', 'Don', 'Messick', 'Casey', 'Kasem', 'voices', 'Scooby', 'Shaggy', 'respectively', 'always', 'got', 'kick', 'out', 'running', 'gag', 'show', 'where', 'Daphne', 'would', 'almost', 'always', 'call', 'out', 'butler', 'time', 'crisis', 'sure', 'enough', 'butler', 'would', 'appear', 'nowhere', 'Velma', 'had', 'few', 'lines', 'series', 'usually', 'saying', 'only', 'catchphrase', 'jinkies', 'eye', 'glasses', 'were', 'exaggerated', 'Fred', 'was', 'written', 'more', 'know', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'usually', 'blaming', 'high', 'school', 'bully', 'Red', 'Herring', 'criminal', 'mystery', 'facial', 'expressions', 'were', 'more', 'lines', 'Tex', 'Avery', 'Bob', 'Clampette', 'where', 'one', 'would', 'see', 'bulging', 'eyes', 'tongues', 'gyrating', 'around', 'outrageous', 'screams', 'series', 'ran', 'ABC-TV', '1988-1991', 're-ran', 'ABC', 'mornings', '1992/1993', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'long', 're-run', 'life', 'network', 'DVD', 'better', 'packaging', 'when', 'i', 'opened', 'DVD', 'i', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'two', 'DVD', 'what', 'i', 'call', 'flip-flapper', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'pull', 'DVD', 'out', 'get', 'one', 'often', 'case', 'many', 'DVD', 'sets', 'where', 'DVD', 'over-lap', 'one', 'DVD', 'are', 'flappers', 'much', 'THUNDERCATS', 'collections', 'have', 'collections', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'i', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Anyway', 'episode', 'crammed', 'visual', 'gags', 'comedy', 'also', 'last', 'Scooby', 'series', 'air', 'one', 'big', 'three', 'networks', 'version', 'left', 'airwaves', '1992/1993', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'new', 'Scooby', 'program', 'first-run', 'production', '2002', 'WHAT', 'NEW', 'SCOOBY-DOO', 'series', 'was', 'WB', 'network', 'not', 'one', 'big', 'three', 'ABC', 'CBS', 'NBC']",N/A

1122633,A1BDZ53DLFNF30,B000ZIZX54,"SnowBunny ""demona_3""","[5, 7]","The new format followed the trend of the ""babyfication"" of older cartoon characters, reducing the original Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! cast to junior-high age. This new show also used the same basic formula as the original 1969 show: the gang (referred to in this show as the ""Scooby-Doo Detective Agency"") solved supernatural-based mysteries, where the villains (the ghosts and monsters) were always revealed as bad guys in masks and costumes. The biggest difference was the tone of the show: With A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, producer Tom Ruegger built upon the slightly irreverent humor he had established along with producer Mitch Schauer with Scooby's previous incarnation, The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo. This resulted in a wackier, more extremely comic version of Scooby-Doo that satirized the conventions of the show's previous incarnations. It was not uncommon for the characters to do wild Bob Clampett-esque takes when they ran into ghosts and monsters, Fred was constantly blaming a character appropriately called ""Red Herring"" for each and every crime on the show (true to his name, Red was always innocent, except for the one episode in which Fred didn't blame him) and shots of the characters (and even the ghosts and monsters) dancing were inserted into the obligatory rock-music-scored chase sequences. The ghosts and monsters themselves were also more comedic, such as a creature made out of molten cheese, and the ghost of a dogcatcher. Also in the series it features Scooby and Shaggy as their favourite superhero duo. Shaggy would be the fearless Commander Cool (a combination of Batman and Superman) and Scooby would be his faithful canine sidekick Mellow Mutt (a combinaton of Krypto, Robin (comics) and Ace the Bat-Hound.)",5,Scooby Doo,1204848000,"03 7, 2008",2008,1737,"['new', 'format', 'followed', 'trend', 'babyfication', 'older', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'reducing', 'original', 'Scooby-Doo', 'Where', 'Are', 'cast', 'junior-high', 'age', 'new', 'show', 'also', 'used', 'same', 'basic', 'formula', 'original', '1969', 'show', 'gang', 'referred', 'show', 'Scooby-Doo', 'Detective', 'Agency', 'solved', 'supernatural-based', 'mysteries', 'where', 'villains', 'ghosts', 'monsters', 'were', 'always', 'revealed', 'bad', 'guys', 'masks', 'costumes', 'biggest', 'difference', 'was', 'tone', 'show', 'A', 'Pup', 'Named', 'Scooby-Doo', 'producer', 'Tom', 'Ruegger', 'built', 'slightly', 'irreverent', 'humor', 'had', 'established', 'producer', 'Mitch', 'Schauer', 'Scooby', 'previous', 'incarnation', '13', 'Ghosts', 'Scooby-Doo', 'resulted', 'wackier', 'more', 'extremely', 'comic', 'version', 'Scooby-Doo', 'satirized', 'conventions', 'show', 'previous', 'incarnations', 'was', 'not', 'uncommon', 'characters', 'do', 'wild', 'Bob', 'Clampett-esque', 'when', 'ran', 'ghosts', 'monsters', 'Fred', 'was', 'constantly', 'blaming', 'character', 'appropriately', 'called', 'Red', 'Herring', 'crime', 'show', 'true', 'name', 'Red', 'was', 'always', 'innocent', 'one', 'episode', 'Fred', 'did', ""n't"", 'blame', 'shots', 'characters', 'even', 'ghosts', 'monsters', 'dancing', 'were', 'inserted', 'obligatory', 'rock-music-scored', 'chase', 'sequences', 'ghosts', 'monsters', 'were', 'also', 'more', 'comedic', 'such', 'creature', 'made', 'molten', 'cheese', 'ghost', 'dogcatcher', 'Also', 'series', 'Scooby', 'Shaggy', 'favourite', 'superhero', 'duo', 'Shaggy', 'would', 'be', 'fearless', 'Commander', 'Cool', 'combination', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'Scooby', 'would', 'be', 'faithful', 'canine', 'sidekick', 'Mellow', 'Mutt', 'combinaton', 'Krypto', 'Robin', 'comics', 'Bat-Hound']",N/A
