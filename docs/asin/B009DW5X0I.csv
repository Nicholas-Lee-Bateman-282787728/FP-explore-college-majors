Have you ever stopped to consider what issues the Simpsons Have Not hit yet?  It's a small list.  So Season 15 is not a grand gem, but you will enjoy many of these episodes.""Treehouse of Horror XIV""- Reaper Madness - Homer becomes Death, Frinkenstein - Prof. Frink creates a Frankenstein monster out of his deceased dad, Stop the World, I Want to Goof Off- Bart and Milhouse get a watch that can stop time.  These are some funny episodes, and have some great laughs.""My Mother the Carjacker""- Glenn Close returns as Mona Simpson.  It's not a tearjerker like the earlier Homer's Mom episode, but there are moments.""The President Wore Pearls""- Lisa becomes student president in a musical episode.  Personally, I am not a huge musical episode fan.""The Regina Monologues""- The Simpsons go to London.  A goofy episode, but some very funny cameos by Tony Blair and J K Rowling.""The Fat and the Furriest""- Homer takes on the bears.  Homer 1- Bears 20""Today, I am a Clown""- Jackie Mason returns as Rabbi Krustofski when Krusty learns he was never given a bar mitzvah.""'Tis the Fifteenth Season""- Homer is the most selfish man in Springfield during Christmas, and once he tries to redeem himself, he makes Flanders jealous.  I have a soft spot for the Christmas episodes.""Marge vs. Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples and Teens, and Gays""- Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples And Teens And Gays Against Parasitic Parents protest having to pay for families after babies riot a cancelled concert.""I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot""- Homer dresses as a battle bot to win a tournament and Bart's admiration. This has some great slapstick, but the B-plot where Snowball II dies and Lisa goes through new cats is funny on a terrible level.""Diatribe of a Mad Housewife""- Marge writes a romance novel and Homer becomes an ambulance driver, adding to the 100+ jobs Homer has on his 20-page resume.""Margical History Tour""- Simpsons Story Time: History Edition!: Henry VIII's wants a son, Lewis and Clark explore North America with Sacagawea, and Salieri tries to destroy Mozart. As a history fan, the combination of history jokes and historical inaccuracy gave me an embolism.""Milhouse Doesn't Live Here Anymore""- Milhouse moves to Capitol City and Homer finds lucrative work in being a bum.""Smart and Smarter""- Maggie takes an IQ test, and she is smarter than Lisa.  Lisa handles this with the grace we have always come to expect from the Simpson family.  The thing I really don't like is the Simon Cowell cameo.""The Ziff Who Came to Dinner""- Artie Ziff crashes with the Simpsons after cheating his stockholders.  This episode also includes the world's most bowel-wrenching ""coupling"" when Artie and Selma get it on... that sentence hurt to type.""Co-Dependent's Day""- Homer and Marge become drinking buddies and it goes great until Homer blames Marge for his DUI.""The Wandering Juvie""- Bart gets sent to juvie after creating a fake wedding registry.""My Big Fat Geek Wedding""- Edna and Skinner are getting married! OK, so Skinner has some reservations.  When Edna storms out, she hooks up with Comic Book Guy.  Skinner tries to win her back at Bi-Mon-Sci-Fi-Con.  My favorite scene is the cameo by Matt Groening.""Catch 'Em If You Can""- Homer and Marge try to take a break from the kids, and Bart and Lisa go after them.""Simple Simpson""- Homer becomes ""Pie Man"".  This is a really fun episode and worth some of the other... less than stellar episodes.""The Way We Weren't""- a flash back episode about Homer and Marge's encounter at camp.""Bart-Mangled Banner""- Bart becomes deaf due to a vaccine shot, and he accidentally moons the flag during a donkey basketball game.  This causes Springfield's patriotism to be questioned.

1595905,A19552QR80XTOX,B009DW5X0I,Jungle Red,"[3, 5]","Barely a month ago, I wrote a review for theThirteenth SeasonDVD set. In that review, I lamented over the decline of quality of the show and even declared I likely wouldn't buy another set. Of course, one should never say never (or likely never) because I bought another Simpsons DVD set. Yeah, I couldn't help myself. Maybe it was the shiny green box or the fact that there were only two copies left at Target that made me backtrack, but I bought it and shockingly I'm kinda glad I did.The 15th season is actually pretty solid. No, it's not like the show used to be in its hay day, but there are still some funny episodes in this season. In fact, I found the 15th season to be a lot better than the 13th and 14th. It's a little more crass but it almost has that old goofy feeling it used to have. There are still some dud episodes, namely, ""Today, I Am a Clown"", ""Marge vs. Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples and Teens, and Gays"" and ""Smart and Smarter"". The episodes aren't terrible, I just don't find most Marge centered episodes to be terribly funny and Krusty can be grating for 22 solid minutes. The ""Treehouse of Horror XIV"" is also a bit weak. The first segment featuring Homer as Death is funny as is the parody of classic Twilight Zone episode ""A Kind of a Stopwatch"" featuring Bart and Milhouse, but the segment featuring Professor Frink's, ""Frinkenstein"", falls flat. Like Krusty, Professor Frink is one of those characters who is mildly amusing in small doses. There is a reason why those characters are supporting - they're really not funny enough to carry more than five minutes of an episode.The stronger episodes of this season are ""'Tis the Fifteenth Season"", ""Diatribe of a Mad Housewife"" (mainly for the subplot of Homer becoming an unqualified ambulance driver), and ""Margical History Tour"". I usually don't like the episodes where historical stories are parodied but the ""Margical History Tour"" episode works for some reason. ""I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot"" is also an entertaining episode because it's always funny when Homer gets grievously injured while attempting to be selfless. The subplot about Lisa's never ending line of dying cats is a bit boring (which is why it's probably a subplot). The only funny aspect of that subplot is when Dr. Hibbert references his Kool & The Gang car air freshener. It is such a random reference that it never fails to make me laugh (and really, really wish there were real Kool & The Gang car air fresheners. Yes, I have looked).The 15th season DVD set is still housed in the same dopey packaging as the 13th and 14th season. Instead of housing the discs in a box that you can simply slip the sleeve out of, there's a flap which must be lifted up. The flap idea is just odd to me because it's obvious it will wear out over time. A minor point really, but I don't understand why whomever makes the packaging choice sticks with this idea. I buy a ton of DVD sets and I've never seen this on any other release. There's no danger of the sleeve slipping out so the flap seems like a pointless extra step that doesn't serve a real function.Despite the packaging aspect, this is still a good release. As I said in my last Simpsons review, my love for the Simpsons waned around the 12th season and I stopped tuning in for new episodes on a weekly basis.

1595912,A3ATD1VNKRQ23C,B009DW5X0I,Mr. Howell,"[0, 0]","I was hesitant to order season 15- not having previously seen any of these episodes, and in light of how bad the last few seasons had been- but desperate for a Simpsons fix, I gave it a shot. You can imagine my surprise, when I popped in the first DVD, and started watching the first ep- a Treehouse Of Horror ep, which are never among my favorites- and lo and behold it was a gem!Ditto for many more episodes.Watching the first half of this season, I saw that the crew at The Simpson's seems to have pulled themselves out of the years-long slump that they were in. Most of the magic of the early seasons is back! (The humor; the use of many favorite secondary characters, etc.)O-K, still, a lot of the intelligent wit is still missing....but hey, at least the show is vastly improved from recent years- well...at least that is true for the first half of this season. The second half of this season is where it appears that the crew started running out of steam again. Once again, they start to revert back to plot-centric episodes, where it appears that they put all their effort into the story line, and neglect the humor and the little touches that often make the show so great. (Not that I can blame them- seeing as it so much work to make these shows, and that many of them have been working on this show for so many years...I mean, they're only human.)But all in all, in my book, half of a good season is better than an entire bad season, so I can't complain (Though I might have, had I paid full price for this season! For half-price- which is what I paid- half a season of good eps seems about right:D)My biggest complaint about this season: TOO MANY MUSICAL numbers. And I'm not just talking about the one musical episode (Why-oh-why do they torture us by making Yeardley Smith sing??!! Please...PLEASE stop!). The use of popular-music cues over montages is done in just about every episode- to the point of being clich&eacute;. I mean, such can be effective when done when appropriate, to good effect, and with restraint- but it seems as though the Simpson's crew has started using such as a crutch to merely fill space. (It's showing, guys!)The BEST thing about this season, is [drum roll].....the COMMENTARIES! Yes! In past seasons, it had seemed like those doing the commentaries had lost interest- but this season, they back to their former glory. I normally enjoy listening to the commentaries as much as/or even more than watching the actual show- and this seasons commentaries were no disappointment. I was in my glory listening to the commentary on every episode. I think writer Tom Gammill was on just about every one...and he is one of my all-time favorites, so that also helped!Again, like earlier seasons, the commentaries were once again very enjoyable; informative and funny. Kudos to all those who participates, for taking the time to do these commentaries. Some of REALLY enjoy them! (I take back what I said earlier. The price of this season would be justified just for the commentaries, alone!).All-in-all...at least 10 very good episodes; and all good commentaries- makes this season add up to 75% good content. But I'm giving it 5 stars for the great commentaries! (I should deduct 4 stars for the continuation of the LOUSY packaging!).If you're a fan of the earlier Simpson's...this season is for you!",5,The Magic Is Back.
