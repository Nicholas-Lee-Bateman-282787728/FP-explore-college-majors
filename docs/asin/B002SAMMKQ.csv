This little indie film is good at grasping all our life's expectations only to have them shattered.  Everyone wants life to be his or her own way, but life is filled with other people, and they, too, want to have things their own way.  Mark Duplass, who stars and co-writes this little slice-of-life gem, shows us how life is marred not so much by the results, but how much our own ""great expectations"" create endless strife, confusion, and disappointments.  Directed by his brother, Jay, the movie shows us significant milestones during a road trip that was meant to do so much less.It all starts out with Josh (Duplass) having dinner with his girlfriend, Emily (Kathryn Aselton), the night before he and his younger brother, Rhett (Rhett Wilkins) shove off for a road trip to retrieve a special recliner (the titled `puffy chair') Josh found on E-bay.  It's all done as an adventure meant to end in Atlanta to celebrate their father's birthday.  She's invited him over to cook him a special meal to remind him how much he'll miss her when he's gone.  Josh is a rock concert promoter, and just as he's got her attention in a lovey-dovey moment, he mixes business with pleasure by taking a cell phone call in the midst of their bonding.  Caving into all the trivia pursuit of his conversation, he earns a frown across the table.  Once he gets crude in a way guys should talk only in the locker room, he gets an old-fashioned slap in the face.  (Misjudgments are central to the whole film's meaning and execution.)  Storming off, she leaves, but he comes by in the morning to patch things up and invite her to come along.  Watching 'The Puffy Chair' I kept thinking about how alike and different it is from 'The Break-up' and how the results and revelations here are better implemented.It takes a little patience for this movie, not that it isn't easy to get hooked into the story, but after about a third of the way, the dialogue, characters, and story are really going places, and the film starts to gel.  I was impressed at how naturally important and surprising things happen without seeming either random or contrived.  When they have time to kill after seeing the prized possession, they go to a movie theatre, where Rhett wanders off with an attendant and both leave the party, both getting serious.  When they all find each other, much is revealed about their take on life, love, marriage, and commitment.  It's a truly loving scene.  It becomes clear that women are from Venus, and men are from outer space as touching scenes and touchy scenes frame every moment of the movie.  Here Rhett has the best of a series of excellent dialogue, ""There's a lot of things that we pursue, but there's nothing more important in life than finding someone you love.""  Does anyone have the goods or stamina to deliver?  Enjoyment of 'The Puffy Chair' is in the development and details.  To relate more of them would spoil the fun.  The filmmakers want us to know that, just like our expectations of a recliner on e-bay, we can damage our capacity to accept and really enjoy life, love, and relationships.  When I watched this film, it reminded me of what may be generation X and Y's `Blow Up' in the sense that it had telling observations about how a whole generation relates to life.  Unlike `Blow Up,' `The Puffy Chair' has revelations to ponder, but it is meant to enlighten and share, not to put down.",4,'The Puffy Chair' Is Just a Prop,1168905600,"01 16, 2007",2007,3486,"['Well', 'lied', 'Puffy', 'Chair', 'more', 'just', 'prop', 'also', 'metaphor', 'little', 'indie', 'film', 'good', 'grasping', 'life', 'expectations', 'only', 'have', 'shattered', 'Everyone', 'life', 'be', 'own', 'way', 'life', 'filled', 'other', 'people', 'too', 'want', 'have', 'things', 'own', 'way', 'Mark', 'Duplass', 'who', 'co-writes', 'little', 'slice-of-life', 'gem', 'how', 'life', 'marred', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'results', 'how', 'much', 'own', 'great', 'expectations', 'create', 'endless', 'strife', 'confusion', 'disappointments', 'Directed', 'brother', 'Jay', 'movie', 'significant', 'milestones', 'road', 'trip', 'was', 'meant', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'out', 'Josh', 'Duplass', 'having', 'dinner', 'girlfriend', 'Emily', 'Kathryn', 'Aselton', 'night', 'younger', 'brother', 'Rhett', 'Rhett', 'Wilkins', 'shove', 'off', 'road', 'trip', 'retrieve', 'special', 'recliner', 'titled', 'puffy', 'chair', 'Josh', 'found', 'E-bay', 'all', 'done', 'adventure', 'meant', 'end', 'Atlanta', 'celebrate', 'father', 'birthday', 'invited', 'cook', 'special', 'meal', 'remind', 'how', 'much', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'when', 'gone', 'Josh', 'rock', 'concert', 'promoter', 'just', 'got', 'attention', 'lovey-dovey', 'moment', 'business', 'pleasure', 'taking', 'cell', 'phone', 'call', 'midst', 'bonding', 'Caving', 'trivia', 'pursuit', 'conversation', 'frown', 'table', 'Once', 'crude', 'way', 'guys', 'should', 'talk', 'only', 'locker', 'room', 'old-fashioned', 'slap', 'face', 'Misjudgments', 'are', 'central', 'whole', 'film', 'meaning', 'execution', 'Storming', 'off', 'morning', 'patch', 'things', 'up', 'invite', 'come', 'along', 'Watching', ""'The"", 'Puffy', 'Chair', 'kept', 'thinking', 'how', 'alike', 'different', ""'The"", 'Break-up', 'how', 'results', 'revelations', 'here', 'are', 'better', 'implemented.It', 'little', 'patience', 'movie', 'not', ""n't"", 'easy', 'get', 'hooked', 'story', 'third', 'way', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'story', 'are', 'really', 'going', 'places', 'film', 'gel', 'was', 'impressed', 'how', 'naturally', 'important', 'surprising', 'things', 'happen', 'seeming', 'random', 'contrived', 'When', 'have', 'time', 'kill', 'seeing', 'prized', 'possession', 'go', 'movie', 'theatre', 'where', 'Rhett', 'off', 'attendant', 'leave', 'party', 'getting', 'serious', 'When', 'find', 'other', 'much', 'revealed', 'take', 'life', 'love', 'marriage', 'commitment', 'truly', 'loving', 'scene', 'clear', 'women', 'are', 'Venus', 'men', 'are', 'outer', 'space', 'touching', 'scenes', 'touchy', 'scenes', 'frame', 'moment', 'movie', 'Here', 'Rhett', 'best', 'series', 'excellent', 'dialogue', 'lot', 'things', 'pursue', 'nothing', 'more', 'important', 'life', 'finding', 'someone', 'love', 'anyone', 'have', 'goods', 'stamina', 'deliver', 'Enjoyment', ""'The"", 'Puffy', 'Chair', 'development', 'details', 'relate', 'more', 'would', 'spoil', 'fun', 'filmmakers', 'want', 'know', 'just', 'expectations', 'recliner', 'e-bay', 'can', 'damage', 'capacity', 'accept', 'really', 'enjoy', 'life', 'love', 'relationships', 'When', 'watched', 'film', 'reminded', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'generation', 'X', 'Y', 'Blow', 'Up', 'sense', 'had', 'telling', 'observations', 'how', 'whole', 'generation', 'life', 'Blow', 'Up', 'Puffy', 'Chair', 'revelations', 'ponder', 'meant', 'enlighten', 'share', 'not', 'put', 'down']",N/A
1286549,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B002SAMMKQ,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[8, 22]","When THE PUFFY CHAIR beckons, beware of its soft, colorful upholstery.The movie starts out quite well. Josh (Mark Duplass) and Emily (Kathryn Aselton) are a boyfriend-girlfriend couple having a bit of a tough time with their relationship. An argument occurs one night and in order to make up, Josh asks Emily to come along on a roadtrip to his father's house where Josh plans to deliver a purplish LazyBoy recliner for his dad's birthday. Emily accepts and along the way they pick up Josh's flighty brother Rhett (Rhett Wilkins), an Amish-looking fellow more in touch with other peoples' lives than his own.The roadtrip quickly devolves into more squabbling between Josh and Emily, as well as a bitter feeling for The Puffy Chair (it is initially very grubby and falling apart until Josh ""convinces"" the original owner to refurbish it). Rhett quickly ascertains that the cause of all of Emily and Josh's problems is the LazyBoy and sets it to the torch one night ...And that's the last we hear of the chair, even though there are many minutes left in the film.The big issue is that the title of the film is The Puffy Chair, when it isn't the chair at all that takes center-stage. It is Josh and Emily's doomed relationship and how the roadtrip seals their feelings for one another. Once the chair is destroyed, there's never another mention of it, even though they arrive at Josh's parents place on his father's birthday without a gift. Josh never mentions the chair, nor does his father. There's no connection between it and the lives of these people. So why call the movie The Puffy Chair and why isn't there a tie-in with it at the end? Bad script.The other annoying thing is that Mark Duplass' brother, Jay Duplass, is not only the director but also the cameraman (and not a very good one). Nearly every scene has a rapid zoom-in on the characters that goes grainy and out of focus before the camera's autofocus catches up and rights itself. Initially this took on a quaint and artistic feel, but rapidly became unbearable.The acting in the film is accessible and entertaining. All of the actors/actresses did fine jobs. But the poor production quality, stilted ending, and lack of coherency to the title caused this flick too many problems.",2,"Why Is It Called ""The Puffy Chair""?",1165017600,"12 2, 2006",2006,2245,"['When', 'PUFFY', 'CHAIR', 'beckons', 'beware', 'soft', 'colorful', 'upholstery.The', 'movie', 'out', 'quite', 'well', 'Josh', 'Mark', 'Duplass', 'Emily', 'Kathryn', 'Aselton', 'are', 'boyfriend-girlfriend', 'couple', 'having', 'bit', 'tough', 'time', 'relationship', 'argument', 'one', 'night', 'order', 'make', 'up', 'Josh', 'Emily', 'come', 'along', 'roadtrip', 'father', 'house', 'where', 'Josh', 'deliver', 'purplish', 'LazyBoy', 'recliner', 'dad', 'birthday', 'Emily', 'accepts', 'way', 'pick', 'up', 'Josh', 'flighty', 'brother', 'Rhett', 'Rhett', 'Wilkins', 'Amish-looking', 'fellow', 'more', 'touch', 'other', 'peoples', 'lives', 'own.The', 'roadtrip', 'quickly', 'more', 'squabbling', 'Josh', 'Emily', 'as', 'well', 'bitter', 'feeling', 'Puffy', 'Chair', 'initially', 'very', 'grubby', 'falling', 'apart', 'Josh', 'convinces', 'original', 'owner', 'refurbish', 'Rhett', 'quickly', 'cause', 'Emily', 'Josh', 'problems', 'LazyBoy', 'torch', 'one', 'night', 'last', 'hear', 'chair', 'even', 'are', 'many', 'minutes', 'left', 'film.The', 'big', 'issue', 'title', 'film', 'Puffy', 'Chair', 'when', ""n't"", 'chair', 'center-stage', 'Josh', 'Emily', 'doomed', 'relationship', 'how', 'roadtrip', 'seals', 'feelings', 'one', 'chair', 'destroyed', 'never', 'mention', 'even', 'arrive', 'Josh', 'parents', 'place', 'father', 'birthday', 'gift', 'Josh', 'never', 'chair', 'father', 'connection', 'lives', 'people', 'So', 'why', 'call', 'movie', 'Puffy', 'Chair', 'why', ""n't"", 'tie-in', 'end', 'Bad', 'other', 'annoying', 'thing', 'Mark', 'Duplass', 'brother', 'Jay', 'Duplass', 'not', 'only', 'director', 'also', 'cameraman', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'Nearly', 'scene', 'rapid', 'zoom-in', 'characters', 'grainy', 'focus', 'camera', 'autofocus', 'up', 'rights', 'Initially', 'took', 'quaint', 'artistic', 'feel', 'rapidly', 'became', 'unbearable.The', 'acting', 'film', 'accessible', 'entertaining', 'actors/actresses', 'did', 'fine', 'jobs', 'poor', 'production', 'quality', 'stilted', 'ending', 'lack', 'coherency', 'title', 'caused', 'flick', 'too', 'many', 'problems']",N/A

1286554,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B002SAMMKQ,Kevin Killian,"[1, 1]","We view this film as a scathing indictment of EBay practices...  Ir is enough to make you sick, the way ordinary people get ripped off and you turn on your computer, go online, log on, and see a picture of a beautifully restored La Z Boy, and then when you get the item in question, well, -- no spoilers here-- it is radically different than the item in the photo.How much longer can a system built on deceit triumph in a world built on capital?  Another reading of this film would reinscribe its Marxist ideology by pointing to the scene when Josh, Rhett and Emily pull up to the motel, and cheap Josh decides he will cheat the motel's management by booking the room at the lower one-person rate and sneaking in his brother and his girlfriend later.  The motel manager, a weary, seen-it-all Gloria Grahame type, is wise to his tricks and effectively prevents him from parking close enough to the cabin to smuggle them in effectively.  Instead he embarks on an impromptu plan that depends on Emily putting on his pants and hoodie, and acting butch, carrying in the suitcases, etc.  The scene is played for laughs, most of them at Josh's expense.  When he takes off his pants behind the wheel, for example, he reveals the tightest and most raggedyass pair of jockey shorts this side of Borat--and later makes a hundred yard underwear rush to the motel room under cover of darkness.  All to save ten dollars.In a world where two brothers and the woman who loves one of them are forced to humiliate themselves by driving thousands of miles from New Jersey to Atlanta, in order to deliver a chair to their dad, EBay practices come under scrutiny a la the best 60 minutes investigate journalism.

1286555,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B002SAMMKQ,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[7, 8]","I don't want to oversell the charms of ""The Puffy Chair,"" which some might label amateurish due to its modest scope and limited budget, but I actually found this little relationship picture to be supremely well done.  Made with heart, if not a lot of money, ""The Puffy Chair"" exemplifies what you can do with a solid, finely nuanced script.  Simple, lovely, observant and sometimes hysterical--I identified, in a surprising way, with many of the elements of this film.  This sleeper had me from the start and kept me enchanted throughout.Written and directed by Mark and Jay Duplass (respectively), their first feature film also stars brother Mark as its central character Josh.  Josh is on a quest to pick up a recliner that he purchased on Ebay.  That's it, that's the whole plot.  Along for the ride is his girlfriend Emily (Kathryn Aselton) with whom he shares a playful, but sometimes volatile, relationship.  Having been together for some time, they are at that stage in their relationship where they feel the pressure of making real commitments.  Picking up his brother Rhett (Rhett Wilkins) adds a dynamic to the trip that is unexpected.  Rhett is a simple soul at peace with the world, which contrasts nicely with the overthinking Josh.  Idealizing the chair as a memory and connection to the past, to simpler times, they then plan to take it to their parent's house as a gift.  (They had a chair just like it growing up.)Along the way, they share some good times and some misadventures--almost every one of which I identified with!  One particularly amusing (but very real) bit involves Josh paying for a motel room as a single and then trying to get all three of them in.  It is, at once, utterly preposterous and absolutely believable.  Other tribulations include the chair being not quite what they had in mind and a whirlwind romance for Rhett.  All of these small moments provide us with tremendous character insight--but more, within the film's trio of characters, they reveal aspects about one another that may change relationships forever.  In slight, and refreshingly subtle ways, you see as perceptions are changed and small observances shift the character interactions.All three of the leads lend great credibility to their roles.  In an almost improvisational style, the cadence of real speech is perfect (at least this represents how people I know talk)!  The relationships are believable, especially the central romance as well as the brotherly link.  I admired how much this little film could accomplish and how astute its observations are about how people communicate.  Of course, everyone learns a little something about themselves--and find out that it isn't a chair that connects them at all.  I recommend this film, seriously, and hope it means as much to you as it did to me.

1286556,A1OZAYRJQAERTK,B002SAMMKQ,Larry Benjamin,"[0, 0]","&#34;The Puffy Chair&#34; has been touted as the apotheosis of the vaunted &#34;Mumblecore&#34; movement of the mid-aughts. However, I'm not sure that a few films by the Duplass brothers and a handful of others count as a &#34;movement.&#34; Otherwise, &#34;Ben-Hur&#34; and &#34;Spartacus&#34; could be referred to as examples of the early-1960s Roman-era cast-of-thousands spectacle movement. Since the filmmakers were probably not even born when the &#34;slice of life&#34; films of the 1970s came out, they can be forgiven for inadvertently doing them over. Not every filmmaker is Quentin Tarantino, intimately familiar with every movie made since les freres Lumiere. Although, Ezra Pound said that he studied the classics to learn what had already been done, and done well, so that it need not be done again. Mumblecore is simply Slice of Life, done again. Maybe someone should have told them.Nevertheless, the Amazon star system is not intended to represent the spectrum of one star equals dreck through five stars equals masterpiece. It's supposed to go from one star (I hated it) to five stars (I loved it). But most reviewers think that their personal tastes represent the final arbiter of quality for the world. This is why the new Justin Bieber album has more five star reviews than anything by Beethoven. So I want to clarify that &#34;The Puffy Chair&#34; is not a great film, but it is an enjoyable film.The plot is as thin as pancake batter with too much milk. We accompany Josh, his girlfriend Emily, and his brother Rhett on a drive from New York City to Atlanta, to deliver a recliner to Josh and Rhett's father for his birthday. Along the way, they fight, they make up, they have adventures, they interact with the locals they meet. The conversation ranges from intense to banal. In short, they act like people you know - your friends, your family, your neighbors. The theme is deciding who you are going to be - making the commitment to how you are going to live your life. The characters, in their mid-twenties, are at the point when they are first starting to think about this seriously, because they realize that the moment has arrived. They realize that they are adults, and each one deals with this in a different way. Josh has to be in charge, make the decisions, and fix everything, even though he's not really ready for this level of responsibility. Emily wants to get married and start having children with Josh, mainly because he's convenient. Rhett is pathologically impulsive, but wants to put off the final decision for a while.

1286558,A36OGGJQKZ4SGI,B002SAMMKQ,"matthewslaughter ""matthewslaughter""","[17, 18]","The Duplass Brothers' ""The Puffy Chair"" requires some getting used to.  The camerawork is amateur in quality, the acting seems mostly improvised and the story is simple.It is about a man named Josh wants to purchase a La-Z-Boy recliner for his father as a birthday gift because it is similar to the one his father owned when he was a kid.  After a small spat with his girlfriend Emily, he asks her to join him on a road trip to pick up the recliner.  While initially planning to pay a short visit to his brother (Rhett), Rhett decides to tag along, adding to the tension between Josh and Emily.After the expository information is out of the way, ""The Puffy Chair,"" and the simplicity with which it is presented, becomes a thoroughly engrossing film.  The recliner itself becomes something of an empty signifier (like the monolith in ""2001"" or the harmonium in ""Punch-Drunk Love,"" objects that are filled the meaning(s) the viewer is willing to make out of it).  To me, it represents (for Josh) a return to the simplicity of his youth, before a passion for music inevitably lead to being in a band that would break up, or before romance was doomed to the same fate.  Throughout the film, the recliner makes Josh, a stable, likeable ""dude"" on the surface, feel elation, disappointment and anger.  At times he is driven into a violent rage when the recliner is defaced, figuratively or literally.Though some might find the subject matter or the approach tedious, the film's power comes from its minimal approach to filmmaking.  Appearing more like a documentary than, say, a light version of Ingmar Bergman's ""Scenes from a Marriage,"" the realism of this film, with its inattention to lighting, framing and sound, add to the tension it ultimately revels in.  I definitely recommend this film to anyone interested in the storytelling ability that can be found in low-budget cinema.",4,Do we deserve better?,1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,1877,"['Duplass', 'Brothers', 'Puffy', 'Chair', 'getting', 'used', 'camerawork', 'amateur', 'quality', 'acting', 'mostly', 'improvised', 'story', 'simple.It', 'man', 'named', 'Josh', 'purchase', 'La-Z-Boy', 'recliner', 'father', 'birthday', 'gift', 'similar', 'one', 'father', 'owned', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'small', 'spat', 'girlfriend', 'Emily', 'join', 'road', 'trip', 'pick', 'up', 'recliner', 'initially', 'planning', 'pay', 'short', 'visit', 'brother', 'Rhett', 'Rhett', 'tag', 'along', 'adding', 'tension', 'Josh', 'Emily.After', 'expository', 'information', 'way', 'Puffy', 'Chair', 'simplicity', 'presented', 'thoroughly', 'engrossing', 'film', 'recliner', 'something', 'empty', 'signifier', 'monolith', '2001', 'harmonium', 'Punch-Drunk', 'Love', 'are', 'filled', 'meaning', 'viewer', 'willing', 'make', 'Josh', 'return', 'simplicity', 'youth', 'passion', 'music', 'inevitably', 'lead', 'being', 'band', 'would', 'break', 'up', 'romance', 'was', 'doomed', 'same', 'fate', 'film', 'recliner', 'Josh', 'stable', 'likeable', 'dude', 'surface', 'feel', 'elation', 'disappointment', 'anger', 'times', 'driven', 'violent', 'rage', 'when', 'recliner', 'defaced', 'figuratively', 'literally.Though', 'might', 'find', 'subject', 'matter', 'approach', 'tedious', 'film', 'power', 'minimal', 'approach', 'filmmaking', 'Appearing', 'more', 'documentary', 'say', 'light', 'version', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Scenes', 'Marriage', 'realism', 'film', 'inattention', 'lighting', 'framing', 'sound', 'add', 'tension', 'ultimately', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'interested', 'storytelling', 'ability', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'low-budget', 'cinema']",N/A
1286559,A244Z9GPMIFOGK,B002SAMMKQ,McGill,"[0, 0]","Real quick premise, although you should really just go ahead and watch the movie:Josh (Mark Duplass of FX's ""The League"") just found what he believes to be the perfect birthday present for his dad.  It's this La-Z-Boy that looks exactly like the one his dad used to have when Josh and his younger brother Rhett were kids.  He found it on eBay (or something pretty similar; looks like it actually says ""eBuy"" but I could be wrong) and has to take a road trip in order to pick it up and then drive to Atlanta GA to see his dad.  At first he decides not to bring along his girlfriend Emily (the insanely beautiful Katie Aselton) but after a scuffle agrees to take her with him.  As you can probably tell, especially after the first scene, the movie's going to be about them and the trip's going to bring up some significant events for their relationship that might or might not change them.  Okay.  So they stop by Josh's brother's house, this sincere fellow Rhett who wants to come along.  This doesn't seem like such a great idea to Emily (since she's figured out too that this trip could really mean something for Josh and herself) but Rhett ends up going with them anyway.  Early on in the movie, you get to pick up a few things about Josh and his pretty much easygoing, whatever-like personality, which tends to be immature and non-committing too much of the time.  Although, really, there are some great happy scenes involving Josh and Emily.  But you can tell there are some issues that need to come to light.  And really, this movie isn't about a plush recliner.  It's about growing up and making decisions.  I really like this type of movie, and ""The Puffy Chair"" does an excellent job with its themes, better than most that deal with the same ideas.  I have sort of a love-hate relationship with Indie flicks because some of them are really good (like this one) and then others try so hard to capture that happy-go-lucky ""I'm-beautiful-because-I'm-sad Am-I-not-just-adorable?"" sort of image and feeling.  Anyway, ""The Puffy Chair"" is tender, honest and yes, it is funny and I think you will really enjoy it.Now then...I really enjoy reading negative reviews of movies.  I love hearing about what all the reviewer just absolutely hated about any particular film.  Their reasons range from the right-on to the ridiculous to the insanely Puritanical.More to the point, I get a kick out of reading scathing, one-star, three-line paragraphs reviewing, with all hell they can muster, a movie that was actually really good.  Example?  Ummmmmm, okay, take the movie, oh I don't know,  ""The Puffy Chair.""  All the naysayers complain about the ""amateurish"" camerawork, the ""brutal"" acting, the lack of traditional framework involved, etc., etc.  Their words, not mine.  Oh, yeah, and one reviewer complained about the apparent lack of nude scenes in the film; someone give this poor guy ""Rudy"" (actual Amazon user) a hug... and maybe a DVD copy of ""Showgirls.""Alright, now for my actual retort.  Have any of these soulless prudes never been, say, thirty-or-so years old?  This movie IS different, granted, but despite the camerawork (which, personally, I adore), can't at least the substance of the movie be appreciated?  And believe you me, there is substance.  Problem is, the movie doesn't play like, what, ""How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days"" or something.  Or ""Showgirls,"" for that matter.  All in all, the movie is pretty somber, choosing to touch on serious topics in very unique and REALISTIC ways.  I'm tired of (and I only use that phrase three times a year) all the negativity regarding the story simply because the style was just way too much for some viewers to handle.  These people are fans of ""Transformers"" and ""Pearl Harbor.""  And yes, I think Michael Bay reeks of death.To all the babbling Brendas: You guys watch home movies, right?  You love home movies, right, despite the probability that your lives suck tremendously, you enjoy watching home movies because of what's going on on-screen, right?  AM I RIGHT?  And let me guess, you probably don't complain too much about the ""amateurish"" camerawork; would you agree?  (My apologies to anyone actually named Brenda.  I think it's a nice name and I have the utmost pleasure of knowing a few of you.)So... I guess the best thing to say this is a good movie although it may not be what you think and maybe it isn't for everyone.

1286560,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B002SAMMKQ,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[1, 1]","The Puffy Chair is a fine addition to a growing body of films that abandon the polish of big studio productions, but replace it with a raw honesty that is rarely seen in the cinema.  Sometimes called ""mumblecore"" films, the most distinctive feature of the movement is the emphasis on realistic dialogue with all its awkward pauses and absurd moments.  The silly things lovers say to each other to be endearing, that are almost embarrassing to observe as an outsider, are on full display here.  The kind of unfiltered revelations that are often employed by documentarians to give an outsider look on a peculiar way of life, are depicted here as not at all peculiar but as characteristic of how most of us do in fact for the most part interact with one another, especially when stress levels rise.  This is combined with a documentary style of videography -- that in this film amounts to a frequent use of zooming and autofocus, that could seem amateurish but is so consistent it begins to resemble a deliberate style and, for me, made the intimacy of the film more plausible.  The general approach is similar to that taken in the sitcom ""The Office,"" which can be a bit frustrating at first but adds to the distinctive feel of the show that makes its style of humor possible.  It is similar in The Puffy Chair: after a while it really comes to feel like this is not a film but a document -- one that the characters would be embarrassed to show, but still a document.Josh finds and purchases a recliner online, just like the one his father loved in their childhood home.  His plan is to make a road trip home, and pick it up on the way in time to deliver it for his father's birthday.  He is reluctant to bring along his girlfriend Emily, though his reasons for this are not immediately apparent.  Eventually, he relents, and along the way they pick up an estranged brother, Rhett, who picks up on a local when they get stuck waiting for the chair to be repaired.  The film can be quite funny, but the prevailing mood is one of awkwardness -- the kind of awkwardness that comes from not knowing what to say to someone who is supposed to be close, because the romantic notions that underlie most films and stories don't really sustain or hold water.  That, in the end, is really what the film is about: the search for something stable, the search for something that can sustain a belief in the possibility of friendship and love being more than just what we do to avoid the awkwardness of separation.  Josh hopes to find something like this at home, to learn something from his parents, to find some of the old connection to his brother, to see whether there is something that he can be for Emily that matches her dreams of having babies and growing old together.  At the backdrop of Josh's worries, apart from his general anxiety about being ""locked down"" -- and this is part of what makes the film as insightful a depiction of contemporary romance -- is his own insecurity about a future, about his own goals and plans, and about his own financial security.  When Josh asks his father how he knew it was right with his mother, the answer is revealing.  They went to a wedding between two people who had no future, who had no clear vision, and, the subtext is clear, who lacked the ambition to secure a financial future for themselves, and, his father and mother thought: we're more put together than they are, we ought to get married.  Nothing magical, really, is behind the dream to live happily ever after behind a picket fence except the commitment to make it work and the financial wherewithal to make it happen.This is a promising first film, by a team of brothers (Jay and Mark Duplass) who have a bright future.  Their follow-up film --Baghead-- was also a lot of fun, a mumblecore horror that is very funny and even has a few scary moments.",4,"Two brothers, a couple of women, a big chair, on the road to some kind of disaster",1262217600,"12 31, 2009",2009,3847,"['Puffy', 'Chair', 'fine', 'addition', 'growing', 'body', 'films', 'abandon', 'polish', 'big', 'studio', 'productions', 'replace', 'raw', 'honesty', 'rarely', 'seen', 'cinema', 'Sometimes', 'called', 'mumblecore', 'films', 'most', 'distinctive', 'feature', 'movement', 'emphasis', 'realistic', 'dialogue', 'awkward', 'pauses', 'absurd', 'moments', 'silly', 'things', 'lovers', 'say', 'other', 'be', 'endearing', 'are', 'almost', 'embarrassing', 'observe', 'outsider', 'are', 'full', 'display', 'here', 'kind', 'unfiltered', 'revelations', 'are', 'often', 'employed', 'documentarians', 'give', 'outsider', 'look', 'peculiar', 'way', 'life', 'are', 'depicted', 'here', 'not', 'peculiar', 'characteristic', 'how', 'most', 'do', 'fact', 'most', 'part', 'interact', 'one', 'especially', 'when', 'stress', 'levels', 'rise', 'combined', 'documentary', 'style', 'videography', 'film', 'frequent', 'use', 'zooming', 'autofocus', 'could', 'seem', 'amateurish', 'so', 'consistent', 'resemble', 'deliberate', 'style', 'made', 'intimacy', 'film', 'more', 'plausible', 'general', 'approach', 'similar', 'taken', 'sitcom', 'Office', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'frustrating', 'first', 'distinctive', 'feel', 'show', 'style', 'humor', 'possible', 'similar', 'Puffy', 'Chair', 'while', 'really', 'feel', 'not', 'film', 'document', 'one', 'characters', 'would', 'be', 'embarrassed', 'show', 'still', 'document.Josh', 'finds', 'purchases', 'recliner', 'online', 'just', 'one', 'father', 'loved', 'childhood', 'home', 'plan', 'make', 'road', 'trip', 'home', 'pick', 'up', 'way', 'time', 'deliver', 'father', 'birthday', 'reluctant', 'bring', 'along', 'girlfriend', 'Emily', 'reasons', 'are', 'not', 'immediately', 'apparent', 'Eventually', 'way', 'pick', 'up', 'estranged', 'brother', 'Rhett', 'who', 'up', 'local', 'when', 'get', 'stuck', 'waiting', 'chair', 'be', 'repaired', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'funny', 'prevailing', 'mood', 'one', 'awkwardness', 'kind', 'awkwardness', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'say', 'someone', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'close', 'romantic', 'notions', 'underlie', 'most', 'films', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'sustain', 'hold', 'water', 'end', 'really', 'what', 'film', 'search', 'something', 'stable', 'search', 'something', 'can', 'sustain', 'belief', 'possibility', 'friendship', 'love', 'being', 'more', 'just', 'what', 'do', 'avoid', 'awkwardness', 'separation', 'Josh', 'find', 'something', 'home', 'learn', 'something', 'parents', 'find', 'old', 'connection', 'brother', 'see', 'something', 'can', 'be', 'Emily', 'dreams', 'having', 'babies', 'growing', 'old', 'together', 'backdrop', 'Josh', 'worries', 'apart', 'general', 'anxiety', 'being', 'locked', 'down', 'part', 'what', 'film', 'insightful', 'depiction', 'contemporary', 'romance', 'own', 'insecurity', 'future', 'own', 'goals', 'plans', 'own', 'financial', 'security', 'When', 'Josh', 'father', 'how', 'knew', 'was', 'right', 'mother', 'answer', 'revealing', 'went', 'wedding', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'future', 'who', 'had', 'clear', 'vision', 'subtext', 'clear', 'who', 'lacked', 'ambition', 'secure', 'financial', 'future', 'father', 'mother', 'thought', ""'re"", 'more', 'put', 'together', 'are', 'ought', 'get', 'married', 'Nothing', 'magical', 'really', 'dream', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'picket', 'fence', 'commitment', 'make', 'work', 'financial', 'wherewithal', 'make', 'promising', 'first', 'film', 'team', 'brothers', 'Jay', 'Mark', 'Duplass', 'who', 'have', 'bright', 'future', 'follow-up', 'film', 'Baghead', 'was', 'also', 'lot', 'fun', 'mumblecore', 'horror', 'very', 'funny', 'even', 'few', 'scary', 'moments']",N/A
1286561,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B002SAMMKQ,Timothy Kearney,"[12, 13]","I sat down to watch THE PUFFY CHAIR, knowing it would be a road flick and expecting a comedy. The preview I read for it sounded like a comedy: A young man takes his high maintenance girlfriend and nature loving brother on a trip to deliver a birthday gift. Road trip plus odd ball characters in my mind usually equals comedy. Maybe it's because I had just seen LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE which uses a similar formula that I expected a few laughs. It's not a comedy, but I wasn't disappointed because it is compelling.The film is the story of a road trip and like all road trip films, at least those that are good, self discovery happens along the way. The film was written and directed by brothers Mark and Jay Duplass and Mark stars in the film as Josh. We learn at the beginning that Josh dreams of a musical career but comes to the realization that while a career in music is not impossible, it is unlikely he will ever be a performer. His girlfriend Emily (Kathryn Aselton) doesn't understand his predicament. She has more pressing concerns on her mind: the future of their relationship. Josh explains that he needs to get away and is leaving to deliver his father's birthday gift: a replica of a Lazy-boy chair his father once owned. He searched E-bay and found an obscure furniture maker in North Carolina who has the item and plans on leaving the next day, alone. Reluctantly he agrees to take Emily and along the way the two visit his brother Rhett (Rhett Wilkins), an extreme New Ageish nature loving who decides to join them. Their experiences along the way make up the core of the film and saying much more would reveal the plot twists.THE PUFFY CHAIR maintained my interest but when it was over, my initial reaction to the characters in the film was mixed at best. For one thing, I had a difficult time warming up to Josh and his travails. All I could think was that he was approaching thirty, grow up already. He was ill-tempered in a self absorbed way, dishonest, and rather stuck on himself. Yet Josh as a character maintained my interest which only happens with good writing and acting. Emily had my sympathy throughout the film. Of course other reviewers will probably have the opposite reaction to mine. I know a few people who saw it agreed with me and others vehemently disagreed. Again this only happens when a story is compelling. Rhett was a bit too much of a stereotype to me: Birkenstock and earth loving crunchy in an almost severe way, but he does add some interesting aspects to the film.I was interested in the film and was drawn into its world which alone is makes it a good film but I'll have to admit, I really enjoyed the bonus feature of the DVD. The two brothers do a mock interview where they explain the concepts behind the film. While the finished product is not perfect, it is well done and a credit to the brothers who produced their first full length film. The project was a labor of love and my guess is that young film makers will find the two inspiring. My guess is that the Duplass brothers will make an impact on the film scene, most likely the independent film scene in the years to come.",4,A Road Trip Like No Other,1167696000,"01 2, 2007",2007,3129,"['sat', 'down', 'watch', 'THE', 'PUFFY', 'CHAIR', 'knowing', 'would', 'be', 'road', 'flick', 'expecting', 'comedy', 'preview', 'read', 'sounded', 'comedy', 'young', 'man', 'high', 'maintenance', 'girlfriend', 'nature', 'loving', 'brother', 'trip', 'deliver', 'birthday', 'gift', 'Road', 'trip', 'odd', 'ball', 'characters', 'mind', 'usually', 'comedy', 'had', 'just', 'seen', 'LITTLE', 'MISS', 'SUNSHINE', 'similar', 'formula', 'expected', 'few', 'laughs', 'not', 'comedy', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'compelling.The', 'film', 'story', 'road', 'trip', 'road', 'trip', 'films', 'least', 'are', 'good', 'self', 'discovery', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'brothers', 'Mark', 'Jay', 'Duplass', 'Mark', 'stars', 'film', 'Josh', 'learn', 'beginning', 'Josh', 'dreams', 'musical', 'career', 'realization', 'career', 'music', 'not', 'impossible', 'unlikely', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'performer', 'girlfriend', 'Emily', 'Kathryn', 'Aselton', ""n't"", 'understand', 'predicament', 'more', 'pressing', 'concerns', 'mind', 'future', 'relationship', 'Josh', 'get', 'away', 'leaving', 'deliver', 'father', 'birthday', 'gift', 'replica', 'Lazy-boy', 'chair', 'father', 'once', 'owned', 'searched', 'E-bay', 'found', 'obscure', 'furniture', 'maker', 'North', 'Carolina', 'who', 'item', 'plans', 'leaving', 'next', 'day', 'alone', 'Reluctantly', 'take', 'Emily', 'way', 'two', 'visit', 'brother', 'Rhett', 'Rhett', 'Wilkins', 'extreme', 'New', 'Ageish', 'nature', 'loving', 'who', 'join', 'experiences', 'way', 'make', 'up', 'core', 'film', 'saying', 'much', 'more', 'would', 'reveal', 'plot', 'twists.THE', 'PUFFY', 'CHAIR', 'maintained', 'interest', 'when', 'was', 'over', 'initial', 'reaction', 'characters', 'film', 'was', 'mixed', 'best', 'one', 'thing', 'had', 'difficult', 'time', 'warming', 'up', 'Josh', 'travails', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'was', 'approaching', 'thirty', 'grow', 'up', 'already', 'was', 'ill-tempered', 'self', 'absorbed', 'way', 'dishonest', 'rather', 'stuck', 'Yet', 'Josh', 'character', 'maintained', 'interest', 'only', 'good', 'writing', 'acting', 'Emily', 'had', 'sympathy', 'film', 'course', 'other', 'reviewers', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'opposite', 'reaction', 'mine', 'know', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'saw', 'agreed', 'others', 'vehemently', 'disagreed', 'Again', 'only', 'when', 'story', 'compelling', 'Rhett', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'stereotype', 'Birkenstock', 'earth', 'loving', 'crunchy', 'almost', 'severe', 'way', 'add', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'film.I', 'was', 'interested', 'film', 'was', 'drawn', 'world', 'alone', 'good', 'film', ""'ll"", 'have', 'admit', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'bonus', 'feature', 'DVD', 'two', 'brothers', 'do', 'mock', 'interview', 'where', 'explain', 'concepts', 'film', 'finished', 'product', 'not', 'perfect', 'well', 'done', 'credit', 'brothers', 'who', 'produced', 'first', 'full', 'length', 'film', 'project', 'was', 'labor', 'love', 'guess', 'young', 'film', 'makers', 'will', 'find', 'two', 'inspiring', 'guess', 'Duplass', 'brothers', 'will', 'make', 'impact', 'film', 'scene', 'most', 'likely', 'independent', 'film', 'scene', 'years', 'come']",N/A
1286562,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B002SAMMKQ,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[3, 3]","The Puffy Chair is the kind of movie that loose usage of the term ""Indie film"" in recent years is all but killing off. A truly independent film, made on a budget of $15,000 (compare to $8 million for Little Miss Sunshine and even $400,000 for Napoleon Dynamite) with no recognizable actors. Without costly equipment and well-known names involved, The Puffy Chair focuses entirely on the story and the acting. The result is amazing. Every frame feels like a slice of painful reality.The amazing part is that there's so much comedy involved as well. Stars Mark Duplass, Katie Aselton, and Rhett Wilkins manage to play some heavy material without weighing the film down with drama. After seeing this film, I can't imagine that the three of them will stay unknown for long.I really don't want to go into the plot of the film at all, because this film seems like it would be much more enjoyable going in wondering what will happen. Throughout the film metaphors are thrown at the audience that are subtle enough not to be noticed until the film is over. And really, if they weren't noticed at all, the film still seems complete. Basically, it's the kind of film you think about afterwards and realize how much more to it there was than you originally thought.The DVD is one of the most complete DVD presentations I've seen in a while. The special features include a self-filmed interview with the Duplass brothers, deleted scenes and outtakes form the film, 3 short films they made (all 3 with Mark Duplass starring, 2 with Katie Aselton), a director commentary track, and then 4 short vlogs showing them promoting their movie in various ways.The whole film and DVD presentation show just how much passion goes into making a successful independent film. I wish I would have seen this movie in the theatre, but now that it's on DVD I will recommend it to everyone. Go buy it, rent it, or borrow it from one of your friends. If you're here on Amazon looking at this review, then you at least have some interest in the film, I promise it's worth your 85 minutes.And Duplass brothers, if you're reading, give me an audition please.",5,"A moving, modern-day slice-of-life",1174435200,"03 21, 2007",2007,2122,"['Puffy', 'Chair', 'kind', 'movie', 'loose', 'usage', 'term', 'Indie', 'film', 'recent', 'years', 'killing', 'off', 'truly', 'independent', 'film', 'made', 'budget', '15,000', 'compare', '8', 'million', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'even', '400,000', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'recognizable', 'actors', 'costly', 'equipment', 'well-known', 'names', 'involved', 'Puffy', 'Chair', 'entirely', 'story', 'acting', 'result', 'amazing', 'frame', 'feels', 'slice', 'painful', 'reality.The', 'amazing', 'part', 'so', 'much', 'comedy', 'involved', 'as', 'well', 'Stars', 'Mark', 'Duplass', 'Katie', 'Aselton', 'Rhett', 'Wilkins', 'manage', 'play', 'heavy', 'material', 'weighing', 'film', 'down', 'drama', 'seeing', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'three', 'will', 'stay', 'unknown', 'long.I', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'plot', 'film', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'going', 'wondering', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'film', 'metaphors', 'are', 'thrown', 'audience', 'are', 'subtle', 'enough', 'not', 'be', 'noticed', 'film', 'really', 'were', ""n't"", 'noticed', 'film', 'still', 'complete', 'Basically', 'kind', 'film', 'think', 'afterwards', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'was', 'originally', 'thought.The', 'DVD', 'one', 'most', 'complete', 'DVD', 'presentations', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'self-filmed', 'interview', 'Duplass', 'brothers', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'form', 'film', '3', 'short', 'films', 'made', '3', 'Mark', 'Duplass', 'starring', '2', 'Katie', 'Aselton', 'director', 'commentary', 'track', 'then', '4', 'short', 'vlogs', 'showing', 'promoting', 'movie', 'various', 'ways.The', 'whole', 'film', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'passion', 'making', 'successful', 'independent', 'film', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'theatre', 'now', 'DVD', 'will', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'Go', 'buy', 'rent', 'borrow', 'one', 'friends', ""'re"", 'here', 'Amazon', 'looking', 'review', 'then', 'least', 'have', 'interest', 'film', 'promise', '85', 'minutes.And', 'Duplass', 'brothers', ""'re"", 'reading', 'give', 'audition', 'please']",N/A
