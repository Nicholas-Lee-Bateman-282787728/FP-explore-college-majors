1111073,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000WOSAZQ,B. E Jackson,"[1, 21]","Well the Boston Red Sox just won the Worid Series. They proved me wrong. I admit I shouldn't have counted them out as quickly as I did. I wasn't taking into consideration the depth of their bullpen and their amazing lineup of really solid offense. I'm glad they won though, seeing as how I love my east coast baseball teams.This is a very important purchase if you're a Red Sox fan because it features the most important games of the entire series.I'm really surprised the Rockies were, well, rocky throughout the whole series. I guess eight days off can really be a bad thing after all. I guess that's just too much time off, and enough to take you off your game. Was really surprised the main hitters weren't stepping up and delivering such as Helton and Hawpe. Four straight loses though... man, that's a real shame. The Angels/Giants was the last really fun World Series back in 2002 because it went seven games. I was hoping this one would do the same thing but it wasn't meant to be I guess.The fans were really excited for their hometeam Rockies and I can tell they were cheering hard to try and get them to play better, but you know, the Red Sox were just too powerful and I hope the Rockies fans eventually come to realize this. The Red Sox have blasted their way through my Phillies many times over the last couple years, and many other National League teams. Just a tough, tough team.Anyway, I was a bit surprised to see how passionate Rockies fans were. I wasn't sure just how much they'd love their team because of all the empty seats during the regular season, but they proved in the World Series they love their team just as much as anyone. You have to admit it was really fun watching such a huge stadium light up the way it did tonight. What a great stadium Coors Field is.I thought Coors Field would be a problem for guys like Manny Ramirez moving around quickly enough to recover balls, but that didn't seem to be much of a problem most of the time.It's really great though seeing guys like Ortiz, Youkilis, Lowell, Crisp, Pedroia, Lester, Ellsbury, Papelbon, and Beckett win a championship. Looking back, it would have been pretty shocking had the Red Sox not won, when you consider all these amazingly talented players on the team.I think the best thing about the Red Sox winning the World Series in 2007 is how they proved that winning it all in 2004 wasn't just a one-time thing. Many people (including me) didn't think they'd be able to repeat that again, and the Yankees would continue dominating the very next year. Didn't happen that way. So once again- congratulations Red Sox fans. I guess a big parade is coming your way tomorrow!",5,"red sox nation, baby",1194566400,"11 9, 2007",2007,2660,"['Well', 'Boston', 'Red', 'Sox', 'just', 'won', 'Worid', 'Series', 'proved', 'wrong', 'admit', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'counted', 'out', 'as', 'quickly', 'did', 'was', ""n't"", 'taking', 'consideration', 'depth', 'bullpen', 'amazing', 'lineup', 'really', 'solid', 'offense', ""'m"", 'glad', 'won', 'though', 'seeing', 'how', 'love', 'east', 'coast', 'baseball', 'teams.This', 'very', 'important', 'purchase', ""'re"", 'Red', 'Sox', 'fan', 'most', 'important', 'games', 'entire', 'series.I', ""'m"", 'really', 'surprised', 'Rockies', 'were', 'well', 'rocky', 'whole', 'series', 'guess', 'eight', 'days', 'off', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'bad', 'thing', 'guess', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'enough', 'take', 'off', 'game', 'Was', 'really', 'surprised', 'main', 'hitters', 'were', ""n't"", 'stepping', 'up', 'delivering', 'such', 'Helton', 'Hawpe', 'Four', 'straight', 'loses', 'man', 'real', 'shame', 'Angels/Giants', 'was', 'last', 'really', 'fun', 'World', 'Series', 'back', '2002', 'went', 'seven', 'games', 'was', 'hoping', 'one', 'would', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'guess.The', 'fans', 'were', 'really', 'excited', 'hometeam', 'Rockies', 'can', 'tell', 'were', 'cheering', 'hard', 'try', 'get', 'play', 'better', 'know', 'Red', 'Sox', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'powerful', 'hope', 'Rockies', 'fans', 'eventually', 'come', 'realize', 'Red', 'Sox', 'have', 'blasted', 'way', 'Phillies', 'many', 'times', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'many', 'other', 'National', 'League', 'teams', 'Just', 'tough', 'tough', 'team.Anyway', 'was', 'bit', 'surprised', 'see', 'how', 'passionate', 'Rockies', 'fans', 'were', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'just', 'how', 'much', ""'d"", 'love', 'team', 'empty', 'seats', 'regular', 'season', 'proved', 'World', 'Series', 'love', 'team', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'anyone', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'really', 'fun', 'watching', 'such', 'huge', 'stadium', 'light', 'up', 'way', 'did', 'tonight', 'What', 'great', 'stadium', 'Coors', 'Field', 'is.I', 'thought', 'Coors', 'Field', 'would', 'be', 'problem', 'guys', 'Manny', 'Ramirez', 'moving', 'around', 'quickly', 'enough', 'recover', 'balls', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'problem', 'most', 'time.It', 'really', 'great', 'seeing', 'guys', 'Ortiz', 'Youkilis', 'Lowell', 'Crisp', 'Pedroia', 'Lester', 'Ellsbury', 'Papelbon', 'Beckett', 'win', 'championship', 'Looking', 'back', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'shocking', 'had', 'Red', 'Sox', 'not', 'won', 'when', 'consider', 'amazingly', 'talented', 'players', 'team.I', 'think', 'best', 'thing', 'Red', 'Sox', 'winning', 'World', 'Series', '2007', 'how', 'proved', 'winning', '2004', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'one-time', 'thing', 'Many', 'people', 'including', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'able', 'repeat', 'again', 'Yankees', 'would', 'continue', 'dominating', 'very', 'next', 'year', 'Did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'way', 'So', 'once', 'again-', 'congratulations', 'Red', 'Sox', 'fans', 'guess', 'big', 'parade', 'coming', 'way', 'tomorrow']",N/A

And swept the Colorado Rockies 4-0 here's the downside of the DVD set. It doesn't have ALL 7 GAMES of the ALCS only games 5-6-7. Why would MLB not put all 7 games on DVD?
