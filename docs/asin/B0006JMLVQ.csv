The story tries to depict a normal family of four, living each its own separate life and pursuing their own individual dreams. The tension between their own routines and realities and what they would like to be makes them explode, one by one, and hit the wall, to come back again to reality and family unity at the end.Some sort of fairy tale, actors and scenography are very good, emotions are openly ventilated - as in any good italian movie worth its name -, and a lot of scenes have real credibility.But when the film is over, without the emotions, the scenography, the great looks of Valentina and the uncertain end of each of the four little stories, very little is left, and the whole exercise shows its superficiality.

870872,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0006JMLVQ,Grady Harp,"[22, 22]","RECORDATI DI ME is a beautifully written and constructed film by Italian director Gabriele Muccino about the workings of a 'normal middle class' family and the bonds and challenges that peak at the time of fragmentation of the family unit that accompanies 10 middle age of the parents and 2) departure of the children at the end of high school. How those crises and adjustments inform the durability of the family unit makes up this thoroughly engrossing and touching film.Carlo Ristuccia (Fabrizio Bentivoglio) is the father embedded in a life long job that is mundane and not at all in line with his dreams of being a writer (he has been writing a novel for years, yet unfinished).  His wife Giulia (Laura Morante) is a committed mother but longs to return to the acting stage she abandoned for marriage.  Their two children are Valentina (Nicolette Romanoff) who is determined to become a glamourous TV star and Paolo (Silvio Muccino) who is aimless in his desire for a life of meaning, a life which would prove he is not as unexceptional as he views himself.Gradually each member of the family encounters escape routes: Carlo meets his old girlfriend Alessia (Monica Bellucci) and begins an affair with her; Giulia is asked to audition for a part in a play directed by one Alfredo (Gabriele Lavia) who makes her feel desirable and noticed; Valentina sleeps around to land a part in a TV giveaway show 'Ali Babbi', and Paolo attempts to attach himself to a girlfriend by planning a birthday party with contraband hashish which he feels will make him appear important in the eyes of his peers.  AS each of these crises reaches a peek, Carlo sustains a back injury while fleeing his home and his resultant hospitalization results in altered perceptions of what the family is all about.The twists and turns of the plot are, of course, far more involved than this short synopsis, and it is the development of each of these characters and the way that they approach change that makes the film work so well.The acting is excellent and the direction is past paced even for a two and a half hour movie.  Yes, much of this has been said before, but the wit and pathos combine to create a story well worth telling and watching.  It is a story about dreams, lost possibilities, and the need to fulfill them.

The story is very simple; a mid-class family, a bored couple and their two sons, she is teenager at the eve of her 18 and he is frustrated adolescent, a loser who at the first glance is incapable to establish a normal relationship , on the other hand she is a glamorous and alluring girl, in search of her bliss, to be accepted and being acclaimed due her dancing abilities.This couple is experiencing a serious conflict of mutual interests that surmount by far, a simple issue of lack of communication, he is successful executive, who never could finish his pretended project, a book that has not ben ended due random barriers, here and there, she is a very sensitive and talented human being, a frustrated actress , now focused into the formation of her children.But soon, this fragile equilibrium will be catalyzed when a sudden encounter with a fevered love of the past ignites and accelerates the boiling point in this family.The work of direction is impeccable, and the struggling  atmosphere in which these personages exist, will push them to find out a reencounter with each one of them when an unexpected accident happens.Laura Morante is terrific in her role (do you remember her as the dance teacher in dancing upstairs of John Malkovioch?) and Monica Belluci gives a fine performance (although her alluring and spelling beauty obligates us to refocus ourselves with her acting).The secondary dramatic lines are handled with secure hand, but told with such conviction that we leave the hall with a bitter taste in our memories , in spite of the pleasant finale.A must-see.",5,Fragmentation and reconstruction!,1188432000,"08 30, 2007",2007,1691,"['main', 'virtues', 'film', 'reside', 'solidity', 'script', 'superb', 'edition', 'formidable', 'cast', 'story', 'very', 'simple', 'mid-class', 'family', 'bored', 'couple', 'two', 'sons', 'teenager', 'eve', '18', 'frustrated', 'adolescent', 'loser', 'who', 'first', 'glance', 'incapable', 'establish', 'normal', 'relationship', 'other', 'hand', 'glamorous', 'alluring', 'girl', 'search', 'bliss', 'be', 'accepted', 'being', 'acclaimed', 'due', 'dancing', 'abilities.This', 'couple', 'experiencing', 'serious', 'conflict', 'mutual', 'interests', 'surmount', 'far', 'simple', 'issue', 'lack', 'communication', 'successful', 'executive', 'who', 'never', 'could', 'finish', 'pretended', 'project', 'book', 'not', 'ben', 'ended', 'due', 'random', 'barriers', 'here', 'there', 'very', 'sensitive', 'talented', 'human', 'being', 'frustrated', 'actress', 'now', 'focused', 'formation', 'children.But', 'soon', 'fragile', 'equilibrium', 'will', 'be', 'catalyzed', 'when', 'sudden', 'encounter', 'fevered', 'love', 'past', 'ignites', 'boiling', 'point', 'family.The', 'work', 'direction', 'impeccable', 'struggling', 'atmosphere', 'personages', 'exist', 'will', 'push', 'find', 'out', 'reencounter', 'one', 'when', 'unexpected', 'accident', 'happens.Laura', 'Morante', 'terrific', 'role', 'do', 'remember', 'dance', 'teacher', 'dancing', 'upstairs', 'John', 'Malkovioch', 'Monica', 'Belluci', 'fine', 'performance', 'alluring', 'spelling', 'beauty', 'refocus', 'acting', '.The', 'secondary', 'dramatic', 'lines', 'are', 'handled', 'secure', 'hand', 'told', 'such', 'conviction', 'leave', 'hall', 'bitter', 'taste', 'memories', 'spite', 'pleasant', 'finale.A', 'must-see']",N/A

Although in this movie she was not a primary or secondary actress, her performance was convincing, although Laura Morante was very strong in the main female role of a frustrated wife who felt she'd done everything life expected of her, expect what she wanted. Fabrizio Bentrivoglio was good in the role of her apathetic husband who also slowly rediscovers his passion in life (with, unsurprisingly, Monica Bellucci as the catalyst.)  Silvio Muccino as the insecure son Paolo and Nicoletta Romanoff as his ruthlessly ambitious sister Valentina also played their roles well.However, it was hard to find this dysfunctional family - each too absorbed in their own lives and concerns - sympathetic. When a crisis occurred, one couldn't help but feel that the rallying together as a family had more to do with their own personal agendas than with love.

870875,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0006JMLVQ,Lee Armstrong,"[66, 69]","This is an excellent film.  Listening to the Italian makes me think it is the language in which all battles should be fought!  ""Ricordati Di Me"" or ""Remember Me, My Love"" is a domestic drama that maps the lack of closeness in the modern life of an Italian family & the bonds of love that lay deep beneath the surface that hold them together.  The blockbuster performance is by Laura Morante as Giulia, the wife of Carlo.  She puts so much energy into this performance that she is incredible.  Kind of like a high-octane version of some of Jane Fonda's edgy classic performances, Laura seems to be torn in numerous directions simultaneously.  Her eyes twitch, her hands flap, she even smokes a cigarette with more nervous energy than some would expend at a football match.  She is a marvel to watch.  Fabrizio Bentivoglio as her husband Carlo portrays the graying accountant, apparently going through a mid-life crisis by having an affair by the lovely Monica Belucci who plays Alessia.  He seems particularly calm & sedate until he comes alive with eyes sparkling for Alessia.  His calmness seems all the more sedate compared to the furious storm of Laura Morante.  As the daughter Valentina, Nicolette Romanoff is beautiful and turns in a good performance as the daughter looking to make her mark in show business and willing to do whatever it takes to accomplish that.  Silvio Muccino as the son Paolo does a nice job as a teenage guy who is trying to get some romantic experience.  Monica Belucci's performance is as deep as she is beautiful.  The photography and pacing of the film are all ably handled by director Gabriele Muccino.  [I particularly enjoyed seeing on the wall of the son's bedroom a large three concentric circle CD holder that doubled as a wall hanging and functional CD container.  Where can I find one of those!  :) ]  While the plot is not shocking or startling, it is well done.  This is a film well worth checking out; and certainly for seeing the fine performance of Laura Morante.

Each one of them is living numb existance.  They are bored, lonely, insecure, unhappy with their jobs/careers or high school existance.  They also feed emotionally off each other.

870877,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0006JMLVQ,Roland E. Zwick,"[13, 26]","**1/2There's a strange sort of paradox at work in ""Remember Me, My Love,"" an Italian film that seems to be operating under some bizarre inverse law of quantum physics.  For while the movie itself moves at a breakneck pace, hurtling from one scene to another with near-reckless abandon, we can't help noticing that the faster it goes, the slower it seems.  Perhaps, we simply wear ourselves out trying to keep up with it and it is this exhaustion factor that ultimately accounts for our restlessness and ennui.""Remember Me, My Love"" focuses on a family of four, whose members haven't been getting along too well of late.  The parents, Carlo and Giulia, are both trying to find ways to cope with a bad case of middle aged crisis: he, by rekindling a romance with a beautiful former flame, and she, by pursuing the career in acting she abandoned when she became a wife and mother.  Their children, Valentina and Paolo, are typical adolescents, all caught up in rebellion, identity crises and complicated affairs of the heart.Although the film attempts to provide some insight into the complexities of modern family life, the characters come across as so whiny and self-indulgent that any sympathy they might have engendered on the part of the audience quickly turns to indifference and even irritation.  The actors do their best (particularly Laura Morante as Giulia), but the characters they are called on to play never engage us much beyond the surface level.  This lack of depth is further compounded by the whirlwind nature of the storytelling, which rarely allows the actors the time they need to settle down and work out the subtle nuances of their roles.In all fairness, I must admit that, in the second hour, the film improves considerably, trafficking in some genuinely raw emotions that exemplify the devastating effects that a disintegrating marriage can have on all members of a family.  Moreover, the film ends on a courageously inconclusive note, which goes a long way towards mitigating some of the theatricality and artificiality that permeate the rest of the movie.Taken as a whole, ""Remember Me, My Love"" turns out to be much less than the sum of its parts, but the performances and a few good scenes do make it palatable.",2,more likely to be forgotten,1114300800,"04 24, 2005",2005,2237,"['strange', 'sort', 'paradox', 'work', 'Remember', 'Me', 'My', 'Love', 'Italian', 'film', 'be', 'operating', 'bizarre', 'inverse', 'law', 'quantum', 'physics', 'movie', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'hurtling', 'one', 'scene', 'near-reckless', 'abandon', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'noticing', 'faster', 'slower', 'Perhaps', 'simply', 'wear', 'out', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', 'exhaustion', 'factor', 'ultimately', 'restlessness', 'ennui', 'Remember', 'Me', 'My', 'Love', 'family', 'four', 'members', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'getting', 'along', 'too', 'well', 'late', 'parents', 'Carlo', 'Giulia', 'are', 'trying', 'find', 'ways', 'cope', 'bad', 'case', 'middle', 'aged', 'crisis', 'rekindling', 'romance', 'beautiful', 'former', 'flame', 'pursuing', 'career', 'acting', 'abandoned', 'when', 'became', 'wife', 'mother', 'children', 'Valentina', 'Paolo', 'are', 'typical', 'adolescents', 'caught', 'up', 'rebellion', 'identity', 'crises', 'complicated', 'affairs', 'heart.Although', 'film', 'attempts', 'provide', 'insight', 'complexities', 'modern', 'family', 'life', 'characters', 'come', 'so', 'whiny', 'self-indulgent', 'sympathy', 'might', 'have', 'engendered', 'part', 'audience', 'quickly', 'indifference', 'even', 'irritation', 'actors', 'do', 'best', 'particularly', 'Laura', 'Morante', 'Giulia', 'characters', 'are', 'called', 'play', 'never', 'engage', 'much', 'surface', 'level', 'lack', 'depth', 'further', 'compounded', 'whirlwind', 'nature', 'storytelling', 'rarely', 'actors', 'time', 'need', 'settle', 'down', 'work', 'out', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'roles.In', 'fairness', 'must', 'admit', 'second', 'hour', 'film', 'considerably', 'trafficking', 'genuinely', 'raw', 'emotions', 'exemplify', 'devastating', 'effects', 'disintegrating', 'marriage', 'can', 'have', 'members', 'family', 'Moreover', 'film', 'courageously', 'inconclusive', 'note', 'long', 'way', 'mitigating', 'theatricality', 'artificiality', 'permeate', 'rest', 'movie.Taken', 'whole', 'Remember', 'Me', 'My', 'Love', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'less', 'sum', 'parts', 'performances', 'few', 'good', 'scenes', 'do', 'make', 'palatable']",N/A
