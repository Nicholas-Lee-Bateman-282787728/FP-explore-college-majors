1028936,AGDANM7XIA7JB,B000JMK6OE,Black Suit,"[7, 15]","I can see what all the internet buzz is about, This Indy-drama is a fascinating look into the alternative lifestyle, master/slave relationship and  also, in a very dramatic way, raises awareness about the shocking Global Slave Trade Market.  THE PET is groundbreaking in that it's the first movie to depict this adult-alternative lifestyle of human Pets.  A subtle blend of bondage & m/s is mixed into this beautiful story of how the love/bond between Master & Pet is ultimately their downfall as they encounter international slave traffickers who take advantage of their unique love bond...all this makes for an unforgettable ground-breaking movie experience. This film is beautifully photographed and directed, and is the first film since ""Secretary"" that delves into alternate lifestyle in a truthful way.

It's not what you think it will be, very disappointing and very disturbing, on an emotional, psychological and humanitarian level. The people who do this, (not te actors but the monsters who traffic real human beings) should be all lined up and shot slowly -beginning at the ankles and going up- for all the suffering they bestow for the kidnapped children and young girls. They belong in the pit of Hell. I can't believe human beings are capable of such cruelty. It made me cry.

Stafford III,"[7, 11]","I may be a bit jaded due to my background in media studies, but the bad acting really gets in the way of the storyline, especially in the first half of the film; the pacing in the first half is also faster than what seems realistic.  For those who can overlook the acting, however, this can be a good film indeed.  Nonetheless, this is a very thought-provoking film, causing the viewer to consider both why someone would agree to become a ""pet"" and consider the reality of the human slave trade (especially the facts about various countries immediately before the closing credits).",3,Interesting,1194566400,"11 9, 2007",2007,581,"['may', 'be', 'bit', 'jaded', 'due', 'background', 'media', 'studies', 'bad', 'acting', 'really', 'way', 'storyline', 'especially', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'pacing', 'first', 'half', 'also', 'faster', 'what', 'realistic', 'who', 'can', 'overlook', 'acting', 'however', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'film', 'indeed', 'Nonetheless', 'very', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'causing', 'viewer', 'consider', 'why', 'someone', 'would', 'agree', 'become', 'pet', 'consider', 'reality', 'human', 'slave', 'trade', 'especially', 'facts', 'various', 'countries', 'immediately', 'closing', 'credits']",The Pet
1028940,A3OO5ZH1EFWNS4,B000JMK6OE,Joseph M. Davis,"[4, 6]","The acting is awful.  The ""pet"" is attractive.  The storyline is ok but not edited well.  The point of the film is a bit murky. At the begining they say that this represents people who voluntarily become slaves- but it looked more like these people were being brainwashed at best. If you are expecting this to be erotic you might be dissapointed.  The slaves are naked but the creeps that keep them treat them more like dogs than lovers.  Actually most people that I know treat their dogs much better.  It is not necessarily well researched either.  At the end they list the countries where slavery still exists... but countries like Israel that are widely reported to still have slaves are left off the list.",3,Interesting Despite Some of the Worst Acting You Will Ever See,1179878400,"05 23, 2007",2007,709,"['acting', 'awful', 'pet', 'attractive', 'storyline', 'ok', 'not', 'edited', 'well', 'point', 'film', 'bit', 'murky', 'begining', 'say', 'people', 'who', 'voluntarily', 'become', 'slaves-', 'looked', 'more', 'people', 'were', 'being', 'brainwashed', 'best', 'are', 'expecting', 'be', 'erotic', 'might', 'be', 'dissapointed', 'slaves', 'are', 'naked', 'creeps', 'keep', 'treat', 'more', 'dogs', 'lovers', 'Actually', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'treat', 'dogs', 'much', 'better', 'not', 'necessarily', 'well', 'researched', 'either', 'end', 'list', 'countries', 'where', 'slavery', 'still', 'countries', 'Israel', 'are', 'widely', 'reported', 'still', 'have', 'slaves', 'are', 'left', 'off', 'list']",The Pet

This film demonstrates the difference between erotic videos and adult videos.  I would not say it is well acted but the acting is good enough so that the movie is intensely erotic without any overt sexual activity.  It is striking in its direct yet not in-your-face sexual attraction but in a different context, a different lifestyle.  And because of this it is definitely not for everyone (as the mixed reviews indicate).  If you find (or think you might find) voluntary submissiveness in and of itself erotic and appealing then this movie is definitely worthwhile.  People who are actually into the ""lifestyle"" will probably find it to be much closer to reality than much of the southern California adult video offerings.",5,This is how you make an erotic video,1215561600,"07 9, 2008",2008,822,"['hottest', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'Image', 'Score', 'featured', 'x-rated', 'sex', 'film', 'difference', 'erotic', 'videos', 'adult', 'videos', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'well', 'acted', 'acting', 'good', 'enough', 'movie', 'intensely', 'erotic', 'overt', 'sexual', 'activity', 'striking', 'direct', 'yet', 'not', 'in-your-face', 'sexual', 'attraction', 'different', 'context', 'different', 'lifestyle', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'indicate', 'find', 'think', 'might', 'find', 'voluntary', 'submissiveness', 'erotic', 'appealing', 'then', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worthwhile', 'People', 'who', 'are', 'actually', 'lifestyle', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'be', 'much', 'closer', 'reality', 'much', 'southern', 'California', 'adult', 'video', 'offerings']",The Pet
1028942,A2HX23GNREU3HG,B000JMK6OE,Machine Guy Will,"[51, 55]","This will contain some spoilers, but this information needs to be known before you spend your money on this film.  The Pet could have been a nice little film about a power exchange alternative lifestyle, even as unlikely as 24/7 animal/pet play may be.  It had enough budget and was shot well enough.  Even the actors were good enough(some were distinctly better than others though).  Pierre Dulat as Philip was quite good.  Andrea Edmondson as Mary/GG was also decent enough.My BIG problem with the film is that the makers promoted it as a ""true"" look into a caring, power exchange alternate lifestyle.  The maker's website description is misleading as is the film's trailer.  They tell you the main characters are intruded upon by international slavers.  In fact, the main characters (except for Mary/GG) are all business partners and friends in a kidnapping/murdering syndicate that deals in selling body parts and slave laborers.  Philip's wish that Mary/GG not be sold as such is purely his personal wish.  So, once again a chance to make a film showing the beauty of a loving dominant/submissive relationship is turned into just another demonization of the BDSM community.  By this depiction, you are either crazy, evil or just plain stupid to participate in such a lifestyle.  Yet, the makers promote this film as being about a loving consensual relationship.  Its really just an exploitation film andwhen you break down the ridiculous plot, there really is not much left tolike. One example of this plot is after a couple weeks of training, having your Pet be devoid of nearly all cognitive function(they do say that clearly).  So, we have people talking about murdering their Pets and selling the organs right in front of them with no reaction.  Oh, come on!Non consensual Slave Trade is a serious subject and one that deserves much better than this film to bring attention to it.Having said that, I did give The Pet two stars.  It is filmedwell enough and it does have some nice scenes in it. Mary/GG and Nicky/Taps(played by Sommer Nguyan)fetching sticks in the nude outdoors(in real snow and cold) is a standout.  If you do see it, it is clear they did it for real.  The other reason is the always lovely Lydia McLane(under a pseudonym Jane Steele), as Red. She has a particularly nice scene at the beginning of the film.This is not a film to set as an example of any BDSM power exchange lifestyle.  It is a terribly flawed, shamelessly misrepresented exploitation film.  If you don't care about spending the money and seeing it for the few good scenes it does contain, you might get some enjoyment.  If you are looking for a decent film about alternative lifestyles, The Pet is not it.",2,Misrepresented Film,1207008000,"04 1, 2008",2008,2698,"['will', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'information', 'be', 'known', 'spend', 'money', 'film', 'Pet', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'little', 'film', 'power', 'exchange', 'alternative', 'lifestyle', 'even', 'as', 'unlikely', '24/7', 'animal/pet', 'play', 'may', 'be', 'had', 'enough', 'budget', 'was', 'shot', 'well', 'enough', 'Even', 'actors', 'were', 'good', 'enough', 'were', 'distinctly', 'better', 'others', 'Pierre', 'Dulat', 'Philip', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'Andrea', 'Edmondson', 'Mary/GG', 'was', 'also', 'decent', 'enough.My', 'BIG', 'problem', 'film', 'makers', 'promoted', 'true', 'look', 'caring', 'power', 'exchange', 'alternate', 'lifestyle', 'maker', 'website', 'description', 'misleading', 'as', 'film', 'trailer', 'tell', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'intruded', 'international', 'slavers', 'fact', 'main', 'characters', 'Mary/GG', 'are', 'business', 'partners', 'friends', 'kidnapping/murdering', 'syndicate', 'selling', 'body', 'parts', 'slave', 'laborers', 'Philip', 'wish', 'Mary/GG', 'not', 'be', 'sold', 'such', 'purely', 'personal', 'wish', 'So', 'once', 'again', 'chance', 'make', 'film', 'showing', 'beauty', 'loving', 'dominant/submissive', 'relationship', 'turned', 'just', 'demonization', 'BDSM', 'community', 'depiction', 'are', 'crazy', 'evil', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'participate', 'such', 'lifestyle', 'makers', 'promote', 'film', 'being', 'loving', 'consensual', 'relationship', 'really', 'just', 'exploitation', 'film', 'break', 'down', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'left', 'tolike', 'One', 'example', 'plot', 'couple', 'weeks', 'training', 'having', 'Pet', 'be', 'devoid', 'nearly', 'cognitive', 'function', 'do', 'say', 'clearly', 'So', 'have', 'people', 'talking', 'murdering', 'Pets', 'selling', 'organs', 'right', 'front', 'reaction', 'Oh', 'come', 'Non', 'consensual', 'Slave', 'Trade', 'serious', 'subject', 'one', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'bring', 'attention', 'it.Having', 'said', 'did', 'give', 'Pet', 'two', 'stars', 'filmedwell', 'enough', 'have', 'nice', 'scenes', 'Mary/GG', 'Nicky/Taps', 'played', 'Sommer', 'Nguyan', 'fetching', 'sticks', 'nude', 'outdoors', 'real', 'snow', 'cold', 'standout', 'do', 'see', 'clear', 'did', 'real', 'other', 'reason', 'always', 'lovely', 'Lydia', 'McLane', 'pseudonym', 'Jane', 'Steele', 'Red', 'particularly', 'nice', 'scene', 'beginning', 'film.This', 'not', 'film', 'set', 'example', 'BDSM', 'power', 'exchange', 'lifestyle', 'terribly', 'flawed', 'shamelessly', 'misrepresented', 'exploitation', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'spending', 'money', 'seeing', 'few', 'good', 'scenes', 'contain', 'might', 'get', 'enjoyment', 'are', 'looking', 'decent', 'film', 'alternative', 'lifestyles', 'Pet', 'not']",The Pet
