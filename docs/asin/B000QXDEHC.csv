Do you relish variety or prefer the TV shows, musical artists, actresses you like to be recognizably the same over their runs, careers?  The answer to that will determine whether you relish the changes introduced for series six of Ballykissangel, as the following exit the show:  Sean Dillon (Lorcan Cranitch), Emma Dillon (Kate McEnery), Father Aidan O'Connell (Don Wycherley), Orla O'Connell (Victoria Smurfit), Danny Byrne (Colin Farrell), and Brian Quigley (Tony Doyle) who, arguably, was the franchise character and driving force of the entire show.  Mr. Doyle passed away in January of 2000, just after the last episode of the fifth year of BallyK was broadcast (in December of 1999).  There were no more episodes of BallyK until the spring of 2001 at which time series six (the first of 8 episodes) began to be broadcast.  Item one of this final year thus was explaining the absence of  Brian Quigley, dealing with that and then trying to move on without this central character.  Of course, it's still BallyK and a welcoming program to watch, but at one and the same time, not the same anymore without the fulcrum (raison d'tre even), of the whole program.Series Six EpisodesEpisode One - God.comBrian Quigley goes missing & there's a new online confessional.Episode Two - DrinkFather Vincent, the new parish priest buys Fitzgerald's Pub AND gets caught for drink driving!Episode Three - The Cat and Daddy GGrainne Dooley receives a goat for her birthday and the residents of Ballyk go to the races.Episode Four - Spirit ProofTalk of Ghosts and fishing problems, meanwhile Kathleen learns to drive.Episode Five - Paul Dooley Sleeps with the FishesA stranger in town turns out to be from Avril's past.

The 6th and final season of Ballykissangel is still great, although we've lost a lot of characters along the way. the new ones that took their places fit in very well and the series moves along smoothly. We are lucky enough to still have Liam and Donal right up to the last episode getting into shenanigan after hilarious shenanigan. The sad loss of Tony Doyle is probably why the show didn't get a 7th season. His Brian Quigley was such a central character. Paul Dooley and family are at the forefront in the last season. He seems to kind of take over for Brian Quigley who thankfully was not killed off in the show. He runs off to Rio because of financial and legal problems. I'm glad they did it this way. At least we can pretend he's still alive on the show. Niamh comes back for a while in this season, and we have yet another priest. This one from Australia and he doesn't look or act like a priest, but he's a pretty good one, we find out as the season moves along.

While some may find it's not how they want to see the clergy portrayed - perhaps it is because they are just so HUMAN - flawed and fantastic all rolled into one.  Isn't that a commentary on all of us?  Fr. MacAnally gives every single curate he has a hard time and is a complete pill - but each of them seems to give kindness back to him in their own way.  Maybe that's a life lesson.  But I will always miss Assumpta ... If you haven't seen BKA from the very beginning, DO IT!

1078174,A1UQIBIU879WBH,B000QXDEHC,Sean Kelly,"[0, 0]","The bride and I were hooked on seasons 1-3 of Bally K, but were turned off in seasons 4 and 5 by the focus on Niamh, one of the most excruciating, annoying, and self-absorbed characters in the history of television (with the character of Sean Dillon being a close second--the romance between the two of them was of no interest). We missed the characters of Assumpta and Peter; the newer priest was a bit too gentle to carry on the tradition set by Stephen Tompkinson in his running battles with Niall Tobin's priest, we felt.Recently began watching season 6 and, while it's a bit disconcerting that all of these new characters appeared out of nowhere, we both feel that the show gained a new energy with the addition of a priest with some backbone and human qualities and the character of Avril, who carries a wee bit of the spunk shown by Assumpta. The show also seems to have been filmed with higher production values, and there seems to be a return to some of the earlier gentle Irish humor (goodbye, thank God, to Uncle Minto). While Tony Doyle is greatly missed, it seems to us that the producers did a fine job trying to set the stage for a few more years which, we all know, didn't happen.If you go into this knowing you're going to meet new characters, you shouldn't be disappointed.",5,A refreshing change,1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,1291,"['bride', 'were', 'hooked', 'seasons', '1-3', 'Bally', 'K', 'were', 'turned', 'off', 'seasons', '4', '5', 'focus', 'Niamh', 'one', 'most', 'excruciating', 'annoying', 'self-absorbed', 'characters', 'history', 'television', 'character', 'Sean', 'Dillon', 'being', 'close', 'second', 'romance', 'two', 'was', 'interest', 'missed', 'characters', 'Assumpta', 'Peter', 'newer', 'priest', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'gentle', 'carry', 'tradition', 'set', 'Stephen', 'Tompkinson', 'running', 'battles', 'Niall', 'Tobin', 'priest', 'felt.Recently', 'began', 'watching', 'season', '6', 'bit', 'disconcerting', 'new', 'characters', 'appeared', 'nowhere', 'feel', 'show', 'gained', 'new', 'energy', 'addition', 'priest', 'backbone', 'human', 'qualities', 'character', 'Avril', 'who', 'wee', 'bit', 'spunk', 'shown', 'Assumpta', 'show', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'higher', 'production', 'values', 'there', 'be', 'return', 'earlier', 'gentle', 'Irish', 'humor', 'goodbye', 'thank', 'God', 'Uncle', 'Minto', 'Tony', 'Doyle', 'greatly', 'missed', 'producers', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'trying', 'set', 'stage', 'few', 'more', 'years', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen.If', 'go', 'knowing', ""'re"", 'going', 'meet', 'new', 'characters', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",Ballykissangel - Complete Series Six
