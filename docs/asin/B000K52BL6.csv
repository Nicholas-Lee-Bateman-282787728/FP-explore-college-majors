1030911,A11BGDC89VS7GR,B000K52BL6,Dingleberry,"[4, 5]","Over eight seasons the writers of 'Will & Grace' provided some genius moments of comedy, moments whose origins are hard to fathom even after repeat viewings.This show is right up there with 'Everybody Loves Raymond' as a classic of social commentary and observation, with a dash of madness thrown in.Having never seen this season on TV, the first episode was a bit of a shock - it was filmed 'live' with minimal editing and some mistakes from the cast left in. It was also filmed using the same type of film that daytime soaps use. At least one other episode gets this treatment over the course of the season and, after the initial surprise, it was a welcome addition to the W&G; experience.I found the last show to be one of the best of its kind (again, as with 'Everybody Loves Raymond'). Unlike that criminally bad last Seinfeld episode, the writers of W&G; kept their heads and combined the two key elements of the show. Veering a little more toward heart than comedy the end is very satisfying - no unrealistic plot twists, no last grab at self parody, just taking the story to an intelligent, imaginative end.In between there is the usual mix of what makes W&G; great. You have to admire the people who created this program and acted in it (including all the incredible supporting characters) for keeping it sharp as a tack all the way to the end.My favorite line of this season captures one of the things that I love best about the whole series - that swift change of direction in midstream:Karen to Jack: ""I'm sorry honey, I don't know what it is today but your faggy little voice is going right through me.""I highly recommend all eight seasons.",5,A fitting end.,1224374400,"10 19, 2008",2008,1653,"['eight', 'seasons', 'writers', ""'Will"", 'Grace', 'provided', 'genius', 'moments', 'comedy', 'moments', 'origins', 'are', 'hard', 'fathom', 'even', 'repeat', 'viewings.This', 'show', 'right', 'there', ""'Everybody"", 'Raymond', 'classic', 'social', 'commentary', 'observation', 'dash', 'madness', 'in.Having', 'never', 'seen', 'season', 'TV', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'bit', 'shock', 'was', 'filmed', ""'live"", 'minimal', 'editing', 'mistakes', 'cast', 'left', 'was', 'also', 'filmed', 'using', 'same', 'type', 'film', 'daytime', 'soaps', 'use', 'least', 'one', 'other', 'episode', 'treatment', 'course', 'season', 'initial', 'surprise', 'was', 'welcome', 'addition', 'W', 'G', 'found', 'last', 'show', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'kind', 'again', ""'Everybody"", 'Raymond', 'criminally', 'bad', 'last', 'Seinfeld', 'episode', 'writers', 'W', 'G', 'kept', 'heads', 'combined', 'two', 'key', 'elements', 'show', 'Veering', 'little', 'more', 'heart', 'comedy', 'end', 'very', 'satisfying', 'unrealistic', 'plot', 'twists', 'last', 'grab', 'self', 'parody', 'just', 'taking', 'story', 'intelligent', 'imaginative', 'end.In', 'usual', 'mix', 'what', 'W', 'G', 'great', 'have', 'admire', 'people', 'who', 'created', 'program', 'acted', 'including', 'incredible', 'supporting', 'characters', 'keeping', 'sharp', 'tack', 'way', 'end.My', 'favorite', 'line', 'season', 'one', 'things', 'love', 'best', 'whole', 'series', 'swift', 'change', 'direction', 'midstream', 'Karen', 'Jack', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'honey', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'today', 'faggy', 'little', 'voice', 'going', 'right', 'highly', 'recommend', 'eight', 'seasons']","Will and Grace - Complete Series 8 [6 DVD Box Set, PAL, Region 2, Import]"
