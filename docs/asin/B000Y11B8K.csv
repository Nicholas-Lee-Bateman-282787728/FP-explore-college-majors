It shows the strength and character of black men and women during a time when they were not considered human. Love developed between the black man and black woman. This love that they shared grew and changed their lives forever.Their Eyes Were Watching God. A story of a black woman who was strong, independent and outspoken during a time when women were supposed to be seen and not heard. Janie was a woman who was ahead of her time and the life she lived sparked jealousy among other women around her. Based on Zora Neal Hurston's Novel Their Eyes Were Watching God.

""Beloved"" also happens to a favorite book of his as well. The quality is first rate and you're getting two for the price of one if you think about it. ""Beloved"" was written by the Nobel Prize Winner Toni Morrison and starring Oprah Winfrey while ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" written by Zora Neale Hurston was long forgotten until Robert Hemenway wrote a book about the queen of the Harlem Renaissance on par with Langston Hughes. Both films are quite an experience. Oprah should have been nominated for an Academy Award in Beloved and Halle Berry was nominated for an Emmy for her performance. They both give brilliant, breathtaking performances in the film with a solid, supporting cast. Both films are first rate in production and are produced by Oprah's film production company. Beloved tries to remain faithful to the novel as does ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" in it's adaptation.",5,Excellent Bargain!
