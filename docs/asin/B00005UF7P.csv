684041,A1MIJKZQ1MIRBM,B00005UF7P,C. Law,"[2, 7]","EPICENTER commits one of the worst crimes I've ever seen commited by a film and it's creators. What's that crime you ask? Stealing! I don't blame the screenwriter. I don't blame Gary Daniels (I mean for a ""B"" action star he usually makes decent ""B"" action fare) but I do blame whoever used the scenes from METRO with Eddie Murphy and the train sequences from MONEY TRAIN and the elevator scene from SPEED. Don't beleieve me? Watch this, then watch METRO and the other movies mentioned. I thought I was the only one who would notice this but apparently I am not. It's that freaking obvious! The whole beginning chase scene is from METRO. They added two bad guy characters to focus on just because Eddie Murphy and Michael Rappaport were their stand ins. I think it's absolute bull---- that the stunt men for METRO and teh special effcets people for SPEED and MONEY TRAIN didnt get paid twice. I mean, technically they worked on this stupid waste of celluloid and didnt even receive credit (not that they'd want it) for it. This film is ridiculous! Stealing scenes from another movie is, in my opinion, the laziest, cheapest, worst thing that could be done in a film. I've already seen METRO - why would I want to see the same exact chase again? I mean, if you don't have the money to make your own movie then don't make it and like director Robert Rodriguez said, if you've written something in your script that you cant afford to shoot...rewrite the script!Skip this movie -- It isnt worth the one star...",1,Attn: Studio exec's - EPICENTER is stealing from you!,1024790400,"06 23, 2002",2002,1505,"['EPICENTER', 'one', 'worst', 'crimes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'commited', 'film', 'creators', 'What', 'crime', 'ask', 'Stealing', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'screenwriter', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Gary', 'Daniels', 'mean', 'B', 'action', 'star', 'usually', 'decent', 'B', 'action', 'fare', 'do', 'blame', 'used', 'scenes', 'METRO', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'train', 'sequences', 'MONEY', 'TRAIN', 'elevator', 'scene', 'SPEED', 'Do', ""n't"", 'beleieve', 'Watch', 'then', 'watch', 'METRO', 'other', 'movies', 'mentioned', 'thought', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'would', 'notice', 'apparently', 'am', 'not', 'freaking', 'obvious', 'whole', 'beginning', 'chase', 'scene', 'METRO', 'added', 'two', 'bad', 'guy', 'characters', 'focus', 'just', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Michael', 'Rappaport', 'were', 'stand', 'ins', 'think', 'absolute', 'bull', 'stunt', 'men', 'METRO', 'teh', 'special', 'effcets', 'people', 'SPEED', 'MONEY', 'TRAIN', 'didnt', 'get', 'paid', 'twice', 'mean', 'technically', 'worked', 'stupid', 'waste', 'celluloid', 'didnt', 'even', 'receive', 'credit', 'not', ""'d"", 'want', 'film', 'ridiculous', 'Stealing', 'scenes', 'movie', 'opinion', 'laziest', 'cheapest', 'worst', 'thing', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'film', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'METRO', 'why', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'same', 'exact', 'chase', 'again', 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'money', 'make', 'own', 'movie', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'director', 'Robert', 'Rodriguez', 'said', ""'ve"", 'written', 'something', 'script', 'cant', 'afford', 'shoot', 'rewrite', 'script', 'Skip', 'movie', 'one', 'star']",Epicenter

The fundamental theme is the attempt by the FBI to recover stolen information vital to national defense. Secondary is the earthquake which occurs just as the Bad Guys and the Good Guys are in the OK Corral (so to speak) ready for a shoot-out. I agree with one of the reviewers that this should not be classified as a Disaster film, although if you are thinking of buying it from Amazon, it is best to buy the Disaster 6 Film collection which has this and five other movies, some good, others watchable, at little cost. Don't expect a Bruce Willis level of production (although a few of his clunkers were no better than this) but, with some tolerance for the acting and the script, it can be as good as the average made for TV film you might be thinking of as an alternative.",3,Better Than Average 'B' Picture,1374969600,"07 28, 2013",2013,913,"['faults', 'definitely', 'not', 'major', 'studio', 'megabucks', 'film', 'compared', 'average', 'type', 'good', 'entertainment', 'fundamental', 'theme', 'attempt', 'FBI', 'recover', 'stolen', 'information', 'vital', 'national', 'defense', 'Secondary', 'earthquake', 'just', 'Bad', 'Guys', 'Good', 'Guys', 'are', 'OK', 'Corral', 'so', 'speak', 'ready', 'shoot-out', 'agree', 'one', 'reviewers', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'classified', 'Disaster', 'film', 'are', 'thinking', 'buying', 'Amazon', 'best', 'buy', 'Disaster', '6', 'Film', 'collection', 'five', 'other', 'movies', 'good', 'others', 'watchable', 'little', 'cost', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'level', 'production', 'few', 'clunkers', 'were', 'better', 'tolerance', 'acting', 'script', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'average', 'made', 'TV', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'thinking', 'alternative']",Epicenter

684045,A1EKA9XSI641C9,B00005UF7P,John S. Milas,"[11, 13]","If you've seen action movies such as Die Hard and True Lies, than you'll want to check this out.  Don't let my 2/5 scare you away, no no no.  This is the sort of movie you need to see once in a while to remind you how good those other movies are.  The plot, to start with, is a huge mess.  Nick Constantine decides to bring down a corporation that he blames for his wife's death, so he steals an advanced computer  chip or something.  Anyway, the whole movie revolves around this guy, Nick, and the chip that he has.  Some bald Russian dude is trying to get it from him, as well as a female FBI agent, who is transfering Nick to Los Angeles after arresting him in a strip club in San Fransisco.  Behind all this the largest earthquake to ever his Los Angeles is going on and is being covered by a newswoman about to fall asleep and crash her helicopter into some stock footage of L.A.  Ok, here's where it gets really interesting.  The FBI agent's neglected daughter is also in L.A.  Her mom, the FBI agent, is going to meet her at a mall because she doesn't want her to live with her dad, so the daughter is meeting Biff's little brother at this mall in case her mom doesn't show up.  Now, for the most interesting part of the entire movie.  During the earthquake the daughter and Biff's youger sibling get stuck on an elevator with an old man named Patrick, who carries a stuffed animal of a parrot around with him because he ""likes birds alot"".  Than there's a plot twist and another FBI agent is running around with the Russians, shooting through floors, and falling through streets in trucks.  Ok, I lied about those things being the most interesting parts in the movie, because they aren't.  Do they sound interesting?  No, they don't.  During this film we are treated to gunfights, surprisingly impressive earthquake sets, and the most bricks I've ever seen raining out of the sky.  There are minature shots of these glass skyscrapers being ravaged by the earthquake sending glass down to the streets, then, there's a shot of people running around on the streets with bricks falling all around them.  Where did these bricks come from?  Than there's scenes inside of these buildings and guys are running around, and seriously, it looks like the bricks are simply appearing and falling out of nowhere at them.  This is a must-see for anyone who's into modern action.  This'll make the big titles seem even better.  Oh, the DVD has ""play movie"" and ""scene selection"", and there aren't even pictures for the scene selection.  The picture is about as grainy as a grain barn, and the clearest audio is probably the peoples' shoes clonking on the floors.

684046,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00005UF7P,Michael Butts,"[6, 9]","EPICENTER kicks off in high gear and maintains a frenetic pace that keeps the adrenaline pumping....and that's all I ask from a B action thriller.  I don't expect great acting, or deep psychological motivations.  This is a great popcorn movie.  And some other interesting things about it:*Gary Daniels, like fellow martial arts actors Chuck Norris, David Bradley, etc., will never win any Oscars.  But this ruggedly handsome and quite different actor shows a deep desire to at least put as much as he can into his performance.  In this one, he relies on this ability rather than his martial arts.  He doesn't take his shirt off at all, and he has only one real fight scene, which is very brief.*Traci Elizabeth Lords likewise won't make the world forget Meryl Streep or Sigourney Weaver, but given her background, her ability to rise even this far is commendable.*It was good to see venerable character actor Henry Beckman again.  As the old codger trapped in the elevator with the two kids, he and his parrot reminded me of those great older movies where actors like Beckman played such a fun, integral part.*And in spite of everything, the movie has a happy ending without the lovers consummating their relationship.It's a fundamentally adrenaline rush!",5,ADRENALINE KICKER,1076630400,"02 13, 2004",2004,1255,"['EPICENTER', 'kicks', 'off', 'high', 'gear', 'frenetic', 'pace', 'adrenaline', 'pumping', '.and', 'ask', 'B', 'action', 'thriller', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'great', 'acting', 'deep', 'psychological', 'motivations', 'great', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'other', 'interesting', 'things', '*Gary', 'Daniels', 'fellow', 'martial', 'arts', 'actors', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'David', 'Bradley', 'etc.', 'will', 'never', 'win', 'Oscars', 'ruggedly', 'handsome', 'quite', 'different', 'actor', 'deep', 'desire', 'least', 'put', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'performance', 'one', 'ability', 'rather', 'martial', 'arts', ""n't"", 'take', 'shirt', 'off', 'only', 'one', 'real', 'fight', 'scene', 'very', 'brief', '*Traci', 'Elizabeth', 'Lords', 'likewise', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'world', 'forget', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'given', 'background', 'ability', 'rise', 'even', 'far', 'commendable', '*It', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'venerable', 'character', 'actor', 'Henry', 'Beckman', 'again', 'old', 'codger', 'trapped', 'elevator', 'two', 'kids', 'parrot', 'reminded', 'great', 'older', 'movies', 'where', 'actors', 'Beckman', 'played', 'fun', 'integral', 'part', '*And', 'spite', 'everything', 'movie', 'happy', 'ending', 'lovers', 'consummating', 'relationship.It', 'fundamentally', 'adrenaline', 'rush']",Epicenter

But it's nowhere near as bad as negative commentators here would have you believe.Gary Daniels is a techie who tried to sell spyplane plans to a foreign government, but is caught in the act by an FBI agent and stressed single mom laughingly played by Traci Lords.Suddenly, the Greatest Earthquake Ever Known doesn't send them to the Land of the Lost, but just makes it a little bit more difficult for Traci to deliver Daniels to the proper authorities, while the bad guys try to execute them both.You know what? This movie was a hoot.
