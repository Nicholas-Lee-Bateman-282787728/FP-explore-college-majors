Steff and Bobby Joe a champions and I hope to see them again in survivor somewhere down the road because they really added to the show a great deal. Another great survivor to watch and own on dvd.

Every season they plaster the winner's picture on the cover of the DVD, so that at a single glance, the mystery's over!! Who thought that this was a good idea?! It seems like the worst idea in the world. Simple fix. Put the whole cast on the cover. There, problem solved! My solution is to never look at the cover when I buy the DVD--just open it and flip it upside down. The people in charge of the cover designs--please fire them now.

1535762,A1NAS49A6LFCYB,B007PK88HA,Johnny Apollo,"[0, 0]","1/28/14. We just finished watching Guatemala (season 11) for the 1st time. 1st off, we absolutely love Survivor! I am glad(and thankful to CBS) that the seasons we missed are now available. I am, however, somewhat disappointed & surprised in the quality of the picture. IMO, it is not up to today's standards - I would compare it to VHS quality. The close-ups are fine but anything else sorts of sucks...I don't understand? For the fan, it isn't bad enough to keep you from  purchasing, but be warned, this is far from being HD...Distance shots are blurry. Note: we watch on an 82&#34; screen so it might be less noticeably bad on a 50&#34; TV... So because of the somewhat crappy video quality, but still being the uber & thankful fan, I give this manufactured on demand set a 4 star rating. Btw, we had zero playback issues whatsoever. Also, the set comes in one large &#34;standard&#34; DVD case that's hinged holding the 5 discs.The bonus features are CBS This Morning interviews. These are one on one studio interviews w/  with voted out players the next morning after that episode aired, way back when. FYI, one of the interviewers - I don't know her name(the black woman), we found to be extremely rude and very ignorant about the show. To us, she came off as a &#34;b&#34; word...We ended up stop watching the interviews - Parvati's Aftershow is a million times better... but at least there are some bonus features - no Ponderosa. Also, The Reunion Show is included.I was going to lower my rating to 3 stars because I read some reviews on here saying that each disc has pictures on that disc of who was getting voted off on that disc's episodes! Obviously,  this would ruin any hope of suspense...,which is extremely stupid and BS! So w/ this knowledge, I secretly made my wife put each disc in the DVD player so I wouldn't know who was getting voted off before watching. BUT it turns, out that my discs DO NOT HAVE ANY FACE PICTURES ON THEM. I hope(Amazon & CBS!!!) this will be the case with the other seasons we still need to purchase, ehem.So despite the sub par video quality, I still highly recommend this set and season, Guatemala, for fans of the show who perhaps started out late like we did and need to catch up on old seasons or just need that &#34;fix&#34; in between current seasons. Guatemala is a very good season and they did have different rules back then - a final two, for example.Note, we didn't start watching Survivor until season 12 and haven't missed an episode since. Prior to that, we have either rented from Netflix or Blockbuster and we're now purchasing what wasn't available for rent - seasons 3,4,5,6 and 11 - the 11th being our first purchase and only retail set we have watched. We did try a ebay bootleg copy of season 11 but was basically unwatchable - save your money...",4,Guatemala,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,2814,"['1/28/14', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Guatemala', 'season', '11', '1st', 'time', '1st', 'absolutely', 'love', 'Survivor', 'am', 'glad', 'thankful', 'CBS', 'seasons', 'missed', 'are', 'now', 'available', 'am', 'however', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'surprised', 'quality', 'picture', 'IMO', 'not', 'up', 'today', 'standards', 'would', 'compare', 'VHS', 'quality', 'close-ups', 'are', 'fine', 'anything', 'else', 'sorts', 'sucks', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'fan', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'keep', 'purchasing', 'be', 'warned', 'far', 'being', 'HD', 'Distance', 'shots', 'are', 'blurry', 'Note', 'watch', '82', '34', 'screen', 'might', 'be', 'less', 'noticeably', 'bad', '50', '34', 'TV', 'So', 'somewhat', 'crappy', 'video', 'quality', 'still', 'being', 'uber', 'thankful', 'fan', 'give', 'manufactured', 'demand', 'set', '4', 'star', 'rating', 'Btw', 'had', 'zero', 'playback', 'issues', 'whatsoever', 'Also', 'set', 'one', 'large', '34', 'standard', '34', 'DVD', 'case', 'hinged', 'holding', '5', 'discs.The', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'CBS', 'Morning', 'interviews', 'are', 'one', 'one', 'studio', 'interviews', 'w/', 'voted', 'out', 'players', 'next', 'morning', 'episode', 'aired', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'FYI', 'one', 'interviewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'name', 'black', 'woman', 'found', 'be', 'extremely', 'rude', 'very', 'ignorant', 'show', 'came', 'off', '34', 'b', '34', 'word', 'ended', 'up', 'stop', 'watching', 'interviews', 'Parvati', 'Aftershow', 'million', 'times', 'better', 'least', 'are', 'bonus', 'features', 'Ponderosa', 'Also', 'Reunion', 'Show', 'included.I', 'was', 'going', 'lower', 'rating', '3', 'stars', 'read', 'reviews', 'here', 'saying', 'disc', 'pictures', 'disc', 'who', 'was', 'getting', 'voted', 'off', 'disc', 'episodes', 'Obviously', 'would', 'ruin', 'hope', 'suspense', 'extremely', 'stupid', 'BS', 'So', 'w/', 'knowledge', 'secretly', 'made', 'wife', 'put', 'disc', 'DVD', 'player', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'was', 'getting', 'voted', 'off', 'watching', 'BUT', 'discs', 'DO', 'NOT', 'HAVE', 'ANY', 'FACE', 'PICTURES', 'ON', 'THEM', 'hope', 'Amazon', 'CBS', 'will', 'be', 'case', 'other', 'seasons', 'still', 'need', 'purchase', 'ehem.So', 'sub', 'par', 'video', 'quality', 'still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'set', 'season', 'Guatemala', 'fans', 'show', 'who', 'perhaps', 'started', 'out', 'late', 'did', 'need', 'catch', 'up', 'old', 'seasons', 'just', 'need', '34', 'fix', '34', 'current', 'seasons', 'Guatemala', 'very', 'good', 'season', 'did', 'have', 'different', 'rules', 'back', 'then', 'final', 'two', 'example.Note', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'watching', 'Survivor', 'season', '12', 'have', ""n't"", 'missed', 'episode', 'Prior', 'have', 'rented', 'Netflix', 'Blockbuster', ""'re"", 'now', 'purchasing', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'available', 'rent', 'seasons', '3,4,5,6', '11', '11th', 'being', 'first', 'purchase', 'only', 'retail', 'set', 'have', 'watched', 'did', 'try', 'ebay', 'bootleg', 'copy', 'season', '11', 'was', 'basically', 'unwatchable', 'save', 'money']",Survivor Guatemala

1535765,ABWHLZFEM5SZY,B007PK88HA,R. Jensen,"[0, 0]","Survivor Guatemala is the last season of the old school era of Survivor (Borneo-here). When this aired I enjoyed it, but it became meh in my opinion later on. Having rewatched it, recently this is the 2nd time a Survivor season has turned out to be much better the 2nd time around.This season was a good one. The location was different and looked A LOT harder to survive in. The challenges were intense and almost all of them seemed to be difficult. The tribe dynamics were great before and after the tribe switch, which pleased me as I felt most previous switches hurt the season for a while. Everyone was interesting to watch, even those who had no shot to win. Once again the game felt like it was hard to just get by, making the season more exciting. The merge had great blindsides and decision making, it was more like what the group was thinking, not just tribal lines. The winner was a good deserving winner, although like with the Amazon I feel the more deserving people, that seemed to be in control the whole season, came up short.Having viewed this season and being reminded of how good oldschool Survivor was, it really begs the question ""Why change the game so much?"" This season had everything that old school Survivor was good for and was surprisingly awesome to watch, why add the HII's after this great season and vertually stop the final 2? But I'm just a reviewer with an opinion.A good way to cap off old school Survivor that many Survivor fans grew up with, and one season that deserves a spot on my shelf.",5,The End of Old school Survivor,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,1527,"['Survivor', 'Guatemala', 'last', 'season', 'old', 'school', 'era', 'Survivor', 'Borneo-here', 'When', 'aired', 'enjoyed', 'became', 'meh', 'opinion', 'later', 'Having', 'rewatched', 'recently', '2nd', 'time', 'Survivor', 'season', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'better', '2nd', 'time', 'around.This', 'season', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'location', 'was', 'different', 'looked', 'LOT', 'harder', 'survive', 'challenges', 'were', 'intense', 'almost', 'seemed', 'be', 'difficult', 'tribe', 'dynamics', 'were', 'great', 'tribe', 'switch', 'pleased', 'felt', 'most', 'previous', 'switches', 'hurt', 'season', 'while', 'Everyone', 'was', 'interesting', 'watch', 'even', 'who', 'had', 'shot', 'win', 'Once', 'again', 'game', 'felt', 'was', 'hard', 'just', 'get', 'making', 'season', 'more', 'exciting', 'merge', 'had', 'great', 'blindsides', 'decision', 'making', 'was', 'more', 'what', 'group', 'was', 'thinking', 'not', 'just', 'tribal', 'lines', 'winner', 'was', 'good', 'deserving', 'winner', 'Amazon', 'feel', 'more', 'deserving', 'people', 'seemed', 'be', 'control', 'whole', 'season', 'came', 'up', 'short.Having', 'viewed', 'season', 'being', 'reminded', 'how', 'good', 'oldschool', 'Survivor', 'was', 'really', 'question', 'Why', 'change', 'game', 'so', 'much', 'season', 'had', 'everything', 'old', 'school', 'Survivor', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'awesome', 'watch', 'why', 'add', 'HII', 'great', 'season', 'vertually', 'stop', 'final', '2', ""'m"", 'just', 'reviewer', 'opinion.A', 'good', 'way', 'cap', 'off', 'old', 'school', 'Survivor', 'many', 'Survivor', 'fans', 'grew', 'up', 'one', 'season', 'spot', 'shelf']",Survivor Guatemala
1535766,A24C3QECVZW512,B007PK88HA,Sam H,"[14, 14]","Survivor: Guatemala seems to be a fairly divisive season and I never understood why some people gave it such a bad rap. The location was unique and epic (the tribal council set was by far the best), the challenges were great and there were some brilliant new ones and the cast was one of the best. Although there are a few lower vis pre-merge boots, pretty much everyone who survived the first four episodes delivered in one way or another and gave us some great moments. Although it was the first season to implement the hidden immunity idol and the returning player twists which both became problems in later seasons, they both actually worked this time round. Overall, Guatemala is one of my favourites and one I think deserves better recognition as a top tier season.
