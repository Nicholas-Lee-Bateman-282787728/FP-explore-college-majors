When you are brought down to the level and in the mind of a serial killers killer is wild! If someone would of told you twenty years ago you would one day be totally enthralled and take sides with a serial killers motives you would have called that person crazy! I really did not want it to end but like all shows it just does. I was bummed at the ending but it makes you wonder if they will come back with a surprise second series with a new twist. It leaves you with that imagination.

But what you need to do with Dexter, and really isn't an option but mandatory WATCH THIS SHOW FROM THE BEGINNING DO NOT WATCH IT OUT OF ORDER... I cannot stress this enough notice I use capital letters in the title also.This show like many shows nowadays on Showtime and HBO and AMC arE just plain incredible and should be watched from the very beginning.

(That's the season after the Trinity killer) OMG was that a huge mistake so dumb, so dumb.That's all it really have to say as my warning the show is great almost every season but my order of seasons that I love the best are in this order - season 2, season 1, season 4, season 6, season 3, season 5... and I'm really stoked for season 7 it's going to be great!So few have watched this do yourself a favor and follow love with Dexter he is so great.PS this show isn't really that scary like pop out and make you jump but it does have some Gore but you get used to that after a while.",5,WARNING:  WATCH IT FROM THE BEGINNING & THIS SHOW IS AWESOME!!!,1345248000,"08 18, 2012",2012,1397,"['time', 'writing', 'price', '181.00', 'cheaper', 'buy', 'seasons', '1-5', 'combo', 'season', '6', 'separately', '***', 'Here', 'Dexter', 'Seasons', '1-5', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'show', 'amazing', 'telling', 'really', ""n't"", 'as', 'important', 'what', 'will', 'tell', 'next', 'everybody', 'pretty', 'much', 'show', 'what', 'need', 'do', 'Dexter', 'really', ""n't"", 'option', 'mandatory', 'WATCH', 'THIS', 'SHOW', 'FROM', 'THE', 'BEGINNING', 'DO', 'NOT', 'WATCH', 'IT', 'OUT', 'ORDER', 'can', 'not', 'stress', 'enough', 'notice', 'use', 'capital', 'letters', 'title', 'also.This', 'show', 'many', 'shows', 'nowadays', 'Showtime', 'HBO', 'AMC', 'arE', 'just', 'plain', 'incredible', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'very', 'beginning', 'Now', '1st', 'watched', 'Dexter', '2', 'years', 'ago', 'watched', '1st', 'episode', 'season', '5', 'parents', 'now', 'longtime', 'Dexter', 'fans', 'will', 'know', 'was', 'huge', 'gigantic', 'mistake', 'season', 'Trinity', 'killer', 'OMG', 'was', 'huge', 'mistake', 'so', 'dumb', 'dumb.That', 'really', 'have', 'say', 'warning', 'show', 'great', 'almost', 'season', 'order', 'seasons', 'love', 'best', 'are', 'order', 'season', '2', 'season', '1', 'season', '4', 'season', '6', 'season', '3', 'season', '5', ""'m"", 'really', 'stoked', 'season', '7', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'So', 'few', 'have', 'watched', 'do', 'favor', 'follow', 'love', 'Dexter', 'so', 'great.PS', 'show', ""n't"", 'really', 'scary', 'pop', 'make', 'jump', 'have', 'Gore', 'get', 'used', 'while']",Dexter: Seasons 1-6
