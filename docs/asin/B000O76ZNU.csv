Heck, maybe even Brokeback Mountain wouldn't even exist without Porky's. See, there's this dang scene in the movie where all these guys are standing around nude with their dang tallywacker's hanging out. Male bonding at it's dang finest. Porky's was followed by the dang masterpiece Porky's II: The Next Day. Now, I must be getting more immature with age, because when I saw this dang sequel several years ago I didn't like it. Now I think it's pretty gosh dang hilarious! And there's this dang blonde broad with the nicest dang rack I've seen in the last dang twenty four hours. And again, there's a group of dang men prancing around with their dang tallywackers exposed. And don't even get me started on that dang preacher. He is so dang over the top that he could give Rev. Al Sharpton a run for his dang money. And Nancy Parsons again steals every dang scene she's in as the P.E. coach. She ain't much to look at, but she's a dang cool broad. Porky's Revenge was the last in this dang classy series. It's also my least favorite, but it's still worth a dang view or two.
