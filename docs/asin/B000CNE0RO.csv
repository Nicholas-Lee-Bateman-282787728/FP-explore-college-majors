Too bad - because it was a good show that had the old ""soilders on patrol"" method of telling their story. A story that should be viewed by as many people as possible to get a valid discussion going.  Guess TV has to be ""reality"" name calling or over the top ""soap-opera"" to hold a large auidenceThe show is bleak- maybe too bleak but it does grab your attention. Even the stories at home are handled well- esp. the one with a soilder who loses a limb. The one that fails a bit is about a lady soilder who goes AWOL - think it was put in cause some Fox exec. wanted a pretty girl to show more skin. But do not let that stop you, buy the show and than talk about it.

958981,A24PTVSZSM8968,B000CNE0RO,Amazon Customer,"[1, 2]","OK, let's get the bad over with first. Yes, the show was filmed in locales that don't look exactly like Iraq. Yes, there were a lot of little things that weren't quite right like how soldiers talked to each other and so forth. Yes, it's a bit of a stretch to imagine that this one squad would have weekly adventures of all types and be sent into some of these situations without any additional backup or support. However, all that aside, this is a pretty decent show about the early part of the action in Iraq. I think the way to view the thing is that it's sort of a montage of all the sorts of issues that came up. Sure one squad might not have done ALL of these things in Iraq, but all of these types of things did happen. The series starts out kind of rough, but you soon get to know and be interested in the characters and as it progresses, some of the annoying little errors in ""Army stuff"" aren't a big deal anymore. If there's one thing the series kind of misses a little, it is the big lack of security and reliable institutions that plagued the whole operation right from the start on the Iraqi side. While this comes through sometimes, the show tends to focus more on ""bad guys"" which, in retrospect, were probably an effect of the chaos more than a cause of it. In any case, if you are interested in the action in Iraq, this isn't a bad series to get.",5,Not too bad,1238198400,"03 28, 2009",2009,1363,"['OK', 'let', 'get', 'bad', 'first', 'Yes', 'show', 'was', 'filmed', 'locales', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'exactly', 'Iraq', 'Yes', 'were', 'lot', 'little', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'right', 'how', 'soldiers', 'talked', 'other', 'so', 'forth', 'Yes', 'bit', 'stretch', 'imagine', 'one', 'squad', 'would', 'have', 'weekly', 'adventures', 'types', 'be', 'sent', 'situations', 'additional', 'backup', 'support', 'However', 'aside', 'pretty', 'decent', 'show', 'early', 'part', 'action', 'Iraq', 'think', 'way', 'view', 'thing', 'sort', 'montage', 'sorts', 'issues', 'came', 'up', 'Sure', 'one', 'squad', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'done', 'things', 'Iraq', 'types', 'things', 'did', 'happen', 'series', 'out', 'kind', 'rough', 'soon', 'get', 'know', 'be', 'interested', 'characters', 'annoying', 'little', 'errors', 'Army', 'stuff', 'are', ""n't"", 'big', 'deal', 'anymore', 'one', 'thing', 'series', 'kind', 'misses', 'little', 'big', 'lack', 'security', 'reliable', 'institutions', 'plagued', 'whole', 'operation', 'right', 'start', 'Iraqi', 'side', 'sometimes', 'show', 'focus', 'more', 'bad', 'guys', 'retrospect', 'were', 'probably', 'effect', 'chaos', 'more', 'cause', 'case', 'are', 'interested', 'action', 'Iraq', ""n't"", 'bad', 'series', 'get']",Over There: Season 1
958982,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,B000CNE0RO,Anton Ilinski,"[5, 5]","First I'd like to say to all the people complaining the show is not truthful and doesn't resemble the real war in Iraq (also with all my respect to the men who served or serving over there now): don't forget it's a movie. If you show me just one where everything is like in reality and where you can't say ""Oh, this is not true"", I'll eat my shoes for dinner. Cinema is about exaggeration and dramatization so we have to live with it. Another matter is if what you see on screen is SO NOT TRUE, that it's impossible to stand it. And ""Over There"" is definately not one of that kind.What I didn't like was that there were no single f-word throughout the series as well as no nudity. It's a bit anoying but quite explainable. The other thing - we saw this squad during 13 episodes and it seemed they were fighting alone. Crowd of extras would do there very well, I mean I had an impression this squad is not a part of some bigger partition, but a unit acting totally on their own. Besides they were executing all kinds of tasks from escorting convoys to seizing villages and releasing hostages. On the other hand it gave more space to show relations within this unit so closer to the end of the show I started liking this fact. And I liked ""Over There"" in general. The actors were doing their best and Erik Palladino was genuinely authentic as sergeant - the leader of the group. ""Over There"" is great at showing military service as just another job, which is just more dangerous than all the others. Seeing people who do this job is very interesting especially for those who never served in the army. It's interesting to watch them deal with situations people usually don't come across in everyday's life, and it's more interesting to see how their job affects their characters, their lives and relationship with their families.So while during the first couple of episodes I was thinking the show didn't live up to my expectations, the more I watched the more I became entangled by it and more excited. I really think the creators of the series succeeded. The last episodes left me craving more which I doubt will ever happen. But if the studio decides to go on with the second season, I'm buying it on DVD for sure.If you like war-movies, ""Over There"" is for you without a question and even if you don't you still might like it - there's much more to it than just shooting etc. Really deserves to be contunued - good TV shows usually pick up speed the more they run.",4,"GOOD, SOLID TV-SHOW",1146614400,"05 3, 2006",2006,2465,"['First', ""'d"", 'like', 'say', 'people', 'complaining', 'show', 'not', 'truthful', ""n't"", 'resemble', 'real', 'war', 'Iraq', 'also', 'respect', 'men', 'who', 'served', 'serving', 'there', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'movie', 'show', 'just', 'one', 'where', 'everything', 'reality', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Oh', 'not', 'true', ""'ll"", 'eat', 'shoes', 'dinner', 'Cinema', 'exaggeration', 'dramatization', 'so', 'have', 'live', 'matter', 'what', 'see', 'screen', 'SO', 'NOT', 'TRUE', 'impossible', 'stand', 'definately', 'not', 'one', 'kind.What', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'were', 'single', 'f-word', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'nudity', 'bit', 'anoying', 'quite', 'explainable', 'other', 'thing', 'saw', 'squad', '13', 'episodes', 'seemed', 'were', 'fighting', 'alone', 'Crowd', 'extras', 'would', 'do', 'there', 'very', 'well', 'mean', 'had', 'impression', 'squad', 'not', 'part', 'bigger', 'partition', 'unit', 'acting', 'totally', 'own', 'were', 'executing', 'kinds', 'tasks', 'escorting', 'convoys', 'seizing', 'villages', 'releasing', 'hostages', 'other', 'hand', 'gave', 'more', 'space', 'show', 'relations', 'unit', 'so', 'closer', 'end', 'show', 'started', 'liking', 'fact', 'liked', 'general', 'actors', 'were', 'doing', 'best', 'Erik', 'Palladino', 'was', 'genuinely', 'authentic', 'sergeant', 'leader', 'group', 'great', 'showing', 'military', 'service', 'just', 'job', 'just', 'more', 'dangerous', 'others', 'Seeing', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'job', 'very', 'interesting', 'especially', 'who', 'never', 'served', 'army', 'interesting', 'watch', 'deal', 'situations', 'people', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'everyday', 'life', 'more', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'job', 'characters', 'lives', 'relationship', 'families.So', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'was', 'thinking', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'more', 'watched', 'more', 'became', 'entangled', 'more', 'excited', 'really', 'think', 'creators', 'series', 'succeeded', 'last', 'episodes', 'left', 'craving', 'more', 'doubt', 'will', 'ever', 'happen', 'studio', 'go', 'second', 'season', ""'m"", 'buying', 'DVD', 'sure.If', 'war-movies', 'question', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'still', 'might', 'like', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'shooting', 'etc', 'Really', 'be', 'contunued', 'good', 'TV', 'shows', 'usually', 'pick', 'up', 'speed', 'more', 'run']",Over There: Season 1

There are many other great war movies and series out that are just as graphic such as the heart rending Band Of Brothers.Timing is the factor here.  World War II was 60+ years ago. Many of the men such as my father are now gone.  The Viet Nam War is part of MY history.  It too, is now ""history"".  With the current war in Iraq still ongoing, I think this show may have upset many people stateside who still have soldiers ""over there"".  Televison IS still about entertainment.  I think many people have seen too much on CNN on a daily basis to be entertained by a movie about an ongoing conflict.It is my thought that once this conflict is finally resolved and all of our soldiers come home, maybe..........10 years or so later this series could come back and be a great success.  The entire series is totally believable.  A great job was done by the cast and entire crew.Another thing to watch is the slew of movies coming out this coming year on 9/11.

Since all of us are serving in the Military, we figured we watch the show about us.  Bottom Line Up Front, the show was outstanding.  It was entertaining and more realistic than some other TV shows or movies.  We don't know why some of the viewers did not like the show, but we thought it was great.  In a single season, they (the producer and the director) did a wonderful job trying to show what our Soldiers might go through:  Fratricide, Wounded Soldier, Death, Family Issues Back Home, etc...  We felt that the show pretty much stayed neutral.  Granted, there were some parts we disagreed or did not like, but we understand those are to spice things up for the show.  Also, the appearance of the Soldiers was decent:  Support elements carrying M16, uniform appearance, etc...  Overall, the show had good stories, excellent characters, and great actions.  We recommend this show to anyone (military or non-military).  We hope this was helpful.  We are going back to reading books.  Our next review will ""Wedding"" by Nicholas Sparks.

Not all the characters are immediately likable, much less admirable, but they all turn out to have value.  The series suffered because the anti-war crowd saw the series as pro-war and the pro-war crowd saw it as anti-war.  Both sides were looking through a bowl of Jello -- dimly.The characters are beautifully written and acted.  Every character convinced me of his or her integrity.  This was one of many elements, especially the air of gritty reality, that reminded me of NYPD BLUE.  As well it should, since many of the people who made NYPD BLUE one of the best shows on network television also made this series.  Ironically, there are guest spots by NYPD BLUE alumni and it seems having been in the earlier series was a death warrant.One of my favorite episodes is one in which an Iraqi prisoner is being interrogated.  I suspect that the gear being worn by the Americans is used to make them seem less human, more a machine, and it gave that extra touch of tension that made the episode so powerful.The writers and directors have learned what someone had to teach me about writing -- showing the telling detail, the little touch that makes a scene complete.As stories go, this one is told far better than almost anything else could have about a subject that seems destined to divide the country for a long time to come.",5,"Magnificent writing, great acting, what are you waiting for?",1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,1441,"['really', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'series', 'when', 'caught', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'drawn', 'immediately', 'Not', 'characters', 'are', 'immediately', 'likable', 'much', 'less', 'admirable', 'turn', 'out', 'have', 'value', 'series', 'suffered', 'anti-war', 'crowd', 'saw', 'series', 'pro-war', 'pro-war', 'crowd', 'saw', 'anti-war', 'sides', 'were', 'looking', 'bowl', 'Jello', 'dimly.The', 'characters', 'are', 'beautifully', 'written', 'acted', 'character', 'convinced', 'integrity', 'was', 'one', 'many', 'elements', 'especially', 'air', 'gritty', 'reality', 'reminded', 'NYPD', 'BLUE', 'well', 'should', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'NYPD', 'BLUE', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'network', 'television', 'also', 'made', 'series', 'Ironically', 'are', 'guest', 'spots', 'NYPD', 'BLUE', 'alumni', 'having', 'been', 'earlier', 'series', 'was', 'death', 'warrant.One', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'one', 'Iraqi', 'prisoner', 'being', 'interrogated', 'suspect', 'gear', 'being', 'worn', 'Americans', 'used', 'make', 'seem', 'less', 'human', 'more', 'machine', 'gave', 'extra', 'touch', 'tension', 'made', 'episode', 'powerful.The', 'writers', 'directors', 'have', 'learned', 'what', 'someone', 'had', 'teach', 'writing', 'showing', 'telling', 'detail', 'little', 'touch', 'scene', 'complete.As', 'stories', 'go', 'one', 'told', 'far', 'better', 'almost', 'anything', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'subject', 'destined', 'divide', 'country', 'long', 'time', 'come']",Over There: Season 1

958990,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000CNE0RO,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[10, 11]","The strongest aspect of ""Over There"" is the way the various characters are developed. Their lives are fleshed out to the point that you feel like you know them and care about what happens to them. As a military wife I have an idea what's goes on.  Some shows manage to alienate their audience with characters that are so annoying or unlikable it's impossible to care about them, but ""Over There"" accomplishes something rare: even when one of the characters does something unforgivably stupid, cruel or selfish, they remain sympathetic and keep you invested in what happens to them.There have been complaints about the way the soldiers are depicted, but I think the show does a good job of being realistic while highlighting these soldiers' professionalism, self-sacrifice and constant struggle to do the best job they can in what are often difficult and dangerous no-win situations.The producers also deserve a lot of credit for not sugarcoating the war or the soldiers' attitudes about the Iraqis. If anything they could do more to make clear what the US media has mostly overlooked: the horrific toll of war on the civilian population. Many people opposed this war on humanitarian grounds.

It is overdramatized, unrealistic, exaggerated, etc. It focuses on a 3rd Infantry Division supply squad that somehow manages to be involved in every possible mission: prisoner transfer and guarding, ""secret"" interrogations, frontline combat, road block duty, and every once in a while actual supplying.The members of the squad never stop arguing with one another, even breaking out into knife fights. The unit is always in a situation where they are under attack and have no support available. While there are some engagements in Iraq where units were outnumbered, it usually didn't take more than a few hours - or less - to reinforce the unit with additional units and fire support. And this usually applies to an advanced platoon or patrol squad - again, not a logistics unit.It is telling that in this film there is no sense of time - is it April 2003, 2005 - 2007? The insurgency and combat operations varied by year.I would contrast this with Generation Kill, where there was a balance between combat, drama, and back stories. Over There doesn't even seem to have a commanding officer anywhere in the vicinity when problems occur.I hope that a better series comes out in the future about the conflict in Iraq. There are undoubtedly many fine, true stories that such a series could be based on; and instead of choosing a random, fictional supply unit why not a real combat company?It's telling that many of the decent, longer shows about conflicts are company based - such as Generation Kill and Band of Brothers. It gives more potential for stories, characters, and there is enough action across a company over time to portray.

I love how FX really takes risks with their programs and Rescue Me, The Shield, and Nip/Tuck are three of television's finest shows. I knew Over There was going to raise a few eyebrows and it dealt with a very sensitive topic but the show was very respectful of the troops in Iraq.Over There was the first show to depict the U.S. in a current war. That was enough to get the conservatives on their case but if you watch the show you will get a feeling of how hard it is to be ""over there"". The cast were very believable characters and the writing was very good. Obviously the show couldn't really be in Iraq but the set looked a lot like Iraq. Over There dealt with humanizing topics and it was a treat to watch.Here's why I don't think Over There was right for television. Its ratings were not that bad for a rookie cable show but FX was under a lot of fire so they crossed it off their list of problems. Despite critical praise I don't think enough people were ready to handle the war fictionalized but it's a shame.

Erik Palladino- The ER alum deserves special recognition. He STOLE the series. He was really that good here.2. The production value was terrific. I don't know where they were filming at, but they did an outstanding job designing the sets and props. EVERYTHING looked totally authentic.3. The story-lines in Iraq did a great job of holding my interest. Granted, I have absolutely no idea how ""real"" any of it is or how much is ""Hollywood"", but they never lost my attention and I was never inclined to fast-forward anything.4. The interplay between and characters in the unit seems completely natural and flows wonderfully. I totally believe it as I'm watching the fire-team get to know one another and develop relationships with each other.What Didn't:1. Almost everything on the home front. With the lone exception of Dumphy's alcoholic wife, I just can't seem to generate even the smallest amount of interest in ANYTHING going on at home.2. The role of the First Lieutenant. First it was ""Mad Cow"" then ""Underpants""; the role of the ""Idiot First Lieutenant"" is the ""red-shirt ensign"" of the series. The production team would have done themselves a favor by filling the role for more then a four or five episode story arc.3. The closing 'Over There' anthem. Simply put, I hate that song. I also can't stand that I'm forced to listen to it because it's running over the last five minutes of the episode. Unfortunately for me though, Chris Gerolmo wrote and performs it. It's something he's clearly proud of and he wasn't going to cut his own song out.A lot of the problems I felt like the series had, I chalked up to this being a first year show still trying to figure out what works and what doesn't. Absolutely none of the issues I had were anything that couldn't (pretty easily) be fixed or corrected.  It simply needed a little more time to find it's way a bit and gain some polish, the same way any new show would.It's really a shame that FX canceled this after one year.  From what I read, the ratings were awful; but I felt there was so much room to grow that if a little more patience was shown this could have been a real winner.It's too bad FX could hang in there a bit longer ...",3,There Was a Ton of Potential ...,1134345600,"12 12, 2005",2005,2330,"['was', 'sort', 'weird', 'series', 'terms', 'what', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'review', ""'m"", 'going', 'bullet-point', 'things.What', 'Worked:1', 'Erik', 'Palladino-', 'ER', 'alum', 'special', 'recognition', 'STOLE', 'series', 'was', 'really', 'that', 'good', 'here.2', 'production', 'value', 'was', 'terrific', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'were', 'filming', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'designing', 'sets', 'props', 'EVERYTHING', 'looked', 'totally', 'authentic.3', 'story-lines', 'Iraq', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'holding', 'interest', 'Granted', 'have', 'absolutely', 'idea', 'how', 'real', 'how', 'much', 'Hollywood', 'never', 'lost', 'attention', 'was', 'never', 'inclined', 'fast-forward', 'anything.4', 'interplay', 'characters', 'unit', 'completely', 'natural', 'wonderfully', 'totally', 'believe', ""'m"", 'watching', 'fire-team', 'get', 'know', 'one', 'develop', 'relationships', ""Didn't:1"", 'Almost', 'everything', 'home', 'front', 'lone', 'exception', 'Dumphy', 'alcoholic', 'wife', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'generate', 'even', 'smallest', 'amount', 'interest', 'ANYTHING', 'going', 'home.2', 'role', 'First', 'Lieutenant', 'First', 'was', 'Mad', 'Cow', 'then', 'Underpants', 'role', 'Idiot', 'First', 'Lieutenant', 'red-shirt', 'ensign', 'series', 'production', 'team', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'favor', 'filling', 'role', 'more', 'then', 'four', 'five', 'episode', 'story', 'arc.3', 'closing', ""'Over"", 'anthem', 'Simply', 'put', 'hate', 'song', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', ""'m"", 'forced', 'listen', 'running', 'over', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'episode', 'Unfortunately', 'Chris', 'Gerolmo', 'wrote', 'performs', 'something', 'clearly', 'proud', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'cut', 'own', 'song', 'out.A', 'lot', 'problems', 'felt', 'series', 'had', 'chalked', 'up', 'being', 'first', 'year', 'show', 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'what', ""n't"", 'Absolutely', 'none', 'issues', 'had', 'were', 'anything', 'could', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'easily', 'be', 'fixed', 'corrected', 'simply', 'needed', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'find', 'way', 'bit', 'gain', 'polish', 'same', 'way', 'new', 'show', 'would.It', 'really', 'shame', 'FX', 'canceled', 'one', 'year', 'what', 'read', 'ratings', 'were', 'awful', 'felt', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'room', 'grow', 'little', 'more', 'patience', 'was', 'shown', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'winner.It', 'too', 'bad', 'FX', 'could', 'hang', 'there', 'bit', 'longer']",Over There: Season 1

959001,A2QDPJRVXL7P4F,B000CNE0RO,"Sahra Badou ""Bibliophile""","[1, 2]","This is by far the best TV series I have watched to date! The acting is superb, and the plot unbelievable, yet based on current events. The writers did an excellent job with the script for this series. The sets were also very believable and authentic. Arab actors very well played the Iraqi people. The filming must have been done in an Arab country, but I'm only guessing. It really felt like you are in Iraq. Much of the events portrayed in the series are actual events that made the news, and for this reason it was very controversial. Reading about real events and actually seeing them acted out are two completely different experiences. The series will re-enforce feelings you have about the Iraqi war, regardless on which side you are on, and whether you are for or against the war.And O yes, I loved the theme song of this series!This TV series does not glamorize war, but rather portrays the horrors of war as viewed from all sides. I wish there were more episodes, or a second season. But from what I have heard, it was pulled off the air for its controversial content. It seems some people in government don't want us to watch this series! A little off the subject, I highly recommend the book, `The End of America', by Naomi Wolf. Things are not the way they used to be in the United States, and people, whether writers, film makers, or journalists, are not free anymore to express themselves without the fear of being persecuted.

959009,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000CNE0RO,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[33, 33]","The short lived TV show ""Over There"" is the first TV show that actually takes place during the conflict overseas that it's dramatizing. Well written, directed and acted the show the show garnered too much controversy forcing Fox to abandon the show despite decent ratings. Produced by Steven Bochco (""L.A. Law"", ""Hill Street Blues"", ""Cop Rock"", ""NYPD Blue"" among many others) the show manages to be more gritty and realistic than anything attempted on television before. While Bochco and his production crew were clearly influenced by gritty war dramas like ""Black Hawk Down"" but the show manages to establish its own style with the pilot episode (which was previously available solo on DVD).""Over There"" follows the misadventures of a group of GIs fighting the war in Iraq and at the same time also followed their families and the impact their absence had on them. It was a unique blend of the personal and the global that portrayed more than one aspect of the effects of war. Unfortunately the show faced political minefields that Fox couldn't dodge and the show was buried in the FX cable schedule. It's very unlikely this show will come back for a sophomore season. It's too bad because this terrific show put a unique human face on a war we've only become familiar with from rhetoric and sound bites on TV.Grainy and all the better looking for it, the director of photography of the show went for a deliberately grainy look to emphasize and heighten the sense of reality of the show. There's a lot of the jittery hand held camera shots that were popular in Ridley Scott's ""Black Hawk Down"" that has come into vogue lately with a lot of movies (including Ridley's brother Tony Scott in his last two films). ""Over There"" strikes the right balance between creating the environment of the show and making it entertaining without causing audiences to be overcome with motion sickness. I didn't see any analog defects and the digital ones are minimal at best. Unlike many shows ""Over There"" boasts a solid 5.1 Dolby Digital mix that makes nice use of the surround speakers. The mix places the audience right in the middle of the action.""Weapons Debriefing"" will make you familiar with the different types of guns in the series and what's being used. At just under six minutes this featurette is right on target. ""Tour of Duty: Filming `Over There'"" documents the production of the last episode of the show. Given that its ratings were so poor unless a major network picks it up, the show is DOA and it's terrific that we have a feature length documentary on the series production. Usually when shows are cancelled there are a couple of featurettes in the can in anticipation of DVD release but nothing as elaborate or involved as here.We also get three exceptional commentary tracks. The pilot episode features writer/director Chris Gerolmo and producer Joan Gerolmo discussing the challenges of shooting the pilot episode and bringing the sense of realism to the screen. ""Spoils of War"" features many of the cast members and ""It's Alright Ma, I'm Only Bleeding"" (quoting Bob Dylan no less in the title) features the military advisors. The latter is particularly interesting because you discover the amount of detail that went into creating a realistic production and some of the short cuts the production had to take to get the series to TV.Although it's time on TV was brief, ""Over There"" provided a fascinating glimpse into modern day war. The most realistic looking TV show of its time and the only one to air during the conflict it's about, the show looks extremely good in this transfer with a nice clip of extras. The price along with the extras makes this an essential purchase for fans of the show.",4,Exceptional series,1143158400,"03 24, 2006",2006,3706,"['short', 'lived', 'TV', 'show', 'first', 'TV', 'show', 'actually', 'place', 'conflict', 'overseas', 'dramatizing', 'Well', 'written', 'directed', 'acted', 'show', 'show', 'garnered', 'too', 'much', 'controversy', 'forcing', 'Fox', 'abandon', 'show', 'decent', 'ratings', 'Produced', 'Steven', 'Bochco', 'L.A.', 'Law', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'Cop', 'Rock', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'many', 'others', 'show', 'be', 'more', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'anything', 'attempted', 'television', 'Bochco', 'production', 'crew', 'were', 'clearly', 'influenced', 'gritty', 'war', 'dramas', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'show', 'establish', 'own', 'style', 'pilot', 'episode', 'was', 'previously', 'available', 'solo', 'DVD', 'misadventures', 'group', 'GIs', 'fighting', 'war', 'Iraq', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'followed', 'families', 'impact', 'absence', 'had', 'was', 'unique', 'blend', 'personal', 'global', 'portrayed', 'more', 'one', 'aspect', 'effects', 'war', 'Unfortunately', 'show', 'faced', 'political', 'minefields', 'Fox', 'could', ""n't"", 'dodge', 'show', 'was', 'buried', 'FX', 'cable', 'schedule', 'very', 'unlikely', 'show', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'sophomore', 'season', 'too', 'bad', 'terrific', 'show', 'put', 'unique', 'human', 'face', 'war', ""'ve"", 'only', 'become', 'familiar', 'rhetoric', 'sound', 'bites', 'TV.Grainy', 'better', 'looking', 'director', 'photography', 'show', 'went', 'deliberately', 'grainy', 'look', 'emphasize', 'heighten', 'sense', 'reality', 'show', 'lot', 'jittery', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'shots', 'were', 'popular', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'come', 'vogue', 'lately', 'lot', 'movies', 'including', 'Ridley', 'brother', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'last', 'two', 'films', 'right', 'balance', 'creating', 'environment', 'show', 'making', 'entertaining', 'causing', 'audiences', 'be', 'overcome', 'motion', 'sickness', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'analog', 'defects', 'digital', 'ones', 'are', 'minimal', 'best', 'many', 'shows', 'solid', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'mix', 'nice', 'use', 'surround', 'speakers', 'mix', 'audience', 'right', 'middle', 'action', 'Weapons', 'Debriefing', 'will', 'make', 'familiar', 'different', 'types', 'guns', 'series', 'what', 'being', 'used', 'just', 'six', 'minutes', 'featurette', 'right', 'target', 'Tour', 'Duty', 'Filming', 'documents', 'production', 'last', 'episode', 'show', 'Given', 'ratings', 'were', 'so', 'poor', 'major', 'network', 'picks', 'up', 'show', 'DOA', 'terrific', 'have', 'feature', 'length', 'documentary', 'series', 'production', 'Usually', 'when', 'shows', 'are', 'cancelled', 'are', 'couple', 'featurettes', 'can', 'anticipation', 'DVD', 'release', 'nothing', 'elaborate', 'involved', 'here.We', 'also', 'get', 'three', 'exceptional', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'pilot', 'episode', 'features', 'writer/director', 'Chris', 'Gerolmo', 'producer', 'Joan', 'Gerolmo', 'discussing', 'challenges', 'shooting', 'pilot', 'episode', 'bringing', 'sense', 'realism', 'screen', 'Spoils', 'War', 'many', 'cast', 'members', 'Alright', 'Ma', ""'m"", 'Only', 'Bleeding', 'quoting', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'less', 'title', 'military', 'advisors', 'latter', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'discover', 'amount', 'detail', 'went', 'creating', 'realistic', 'production', 'short', 'production', 'had', 'take', 'get', 'series', 'TV.Although', 'time', 'TV', 'was', 'brief', 'provided', 'fascinating', 'glimpse', 'modern', 'day', 'war', 'most', 'realistic', 'looking', 'TV', 'show', 'time', 'only', 'one', 'air', 'conflict', 'about', 'show', 'extremely', 'good', 'transfer', 'nice', 'clip', 'extras', 'price', 'extras', 'essential', 'purchase', 'fans', 'show']",Over There: Season 1

The special effects/photography were good, and most of the characters were believable.  It's definitely worth seeing.  The ""back home"" scenes didn't add much to the series because it seemed disconnected to their spouses ""over there.""  Perhaps there wasn't enough character development for those at home probably since the series was so short.  Thirteen episodes for one season is too short.There were many touching scenes, believable plots, and fairly realistic characters.  More seasons could have improved the show and fixed some of the flaws.  The dialog could have been improved in some episodes.  I got the sense that not enough military and Iraq war research was done for the show.The screaming sergeant didn't seem interested in supporting his troops at the beginning then improved toward the end.  It's like the writers were learning as they go.  Also, they overused ""soldier"" too much.  I would think unit commanders and sergeants would know their own soldier's names.  I never could figure out who was who because they rarely called the soldiers by their names.I never heard of females being on the front lines in combat unless they were separated from their unit.  It was never clear where the two women came from.  About midway, it was mentioned they were mechanics and I never could figure out where the rest of their unit was or why they didn't try to get back to their unit.  I think the addition of the women in an infantry unit was just to boost ratings and wishful thinking on the part of the writers.The squad at the center of the series seemed rather small and the only ones fighting the Iraq war.  They could have used some extras.The theme song over the last few minutes of the show could have been scrapped.  It was terrible and like someone else said something more epic could have been created.  The documentary in the extras said the show got it's name from that song.The TV series Tour of Duty was much better as was Band of Brothers.  I think Over There was trying to be another Tour of Duty with a different war.  It was brave of the producers to do a series on a then-current war and that's probably why it didn't make it.Overall it was pretty good for a lower-budget production.

But I know other Desert Storm Vets who hated them.  I have more than a few friends and relatives who are either in Iraq right now or are home from Iraq.  The ones who are home who saw this show agreed that some of the tactics were wrong and not all the jargon was correct, but they were so appreciative that someone finally seemed to nail how they felt and what they went through.  I really liked this show.  The characters reminded me of men and women I served with.  No, not all soldiers act like these characters.  I was a soldier, I was deep in Iraq in Desert Storm.  We were soldier's, but we were still people with personalities and lives.  As collective as war may sound each soldier will have a different experience.  Soldiers who served right next to me will have a completely different story to tell you.  To dimiss this series because it lacked exact details is a disservice to the fine writing and acting on the show.  I found it vitally important that someone had the guts to make this show.  It seems this war just keeps going on and on and it moves from front page news to 4th page news.
