After all these years, I still cannot get JJL out of my mind when she remembers the lines of the letter sent by her pathetic overseas soldier lover who vainly tries to save hear...I cannot help but still shed a tear when she hugs the boy who saves her from the gangrapers when remembering those lines. This is due to either JJL's enormous talents or to the fact that how disturbing this masterful flick is...or due to both. Anyone who thinks that this movie, among all other things, is deprived of soul, feeling, sense and love should see a shrink. They are only well disguised behind a paranoic, real, bleak, darkly realistic streets of Brooklyn in 1950s.

All of the characters are so intensely disliked that there is nothing to hope for the rest of it. There is just nothing else. Whatever the crap they are doing, I am having none of it, and I couldn't wait for the film to end. Where is the police on the street the entire time? Completely unrealistic. Even more unrealistic is how fake the characters tried to imitate the era of that time through their clothes, mannerisms, and attitudes. Such a fake acting. I've grown extremely wearisome of Burt Young due to his oft repeated demeanor that he carries from Rocky movies. Of all, the worst performance goes to Jennifer Jason Leigh (thoroughly overdone) who stinks in every film there is.

This is one of those films.  Very postwar early 50's, but a 1950's Donna Reed would have been lost in.  It truly is the opposite of Pleasantville.Hubert Selby's dark vision of the common man is woven around several characters in a Brooklyn neighborhood.  A factory worker called Big Joe is played by Burt Young.  Instinctively brutal yet pathetically naive, he wanders through his Brooklyn neighborhood functioning at the most elemental level reinforced only by an inherited value system to which he is single-mindedly loyal.  Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a whore whose timeline for thoughts of her future stretches out only several hours.  She gets by in life rolling drunks whose tolerance for liquor is less than hers, or giving sex to those who outlast her.  A soldier soon to be shipped out takes her to Manhattan for his last few stateside days and falls in love with her.  Tralala (Leigh's character) recognizes the attendant lust but has no clue about the implications of his love.  As she sees him off, the Lieutenant hands her an envelope.  Tra's face lights up as her vision of the order in life (she gives him sex, he has a good time, he gives her money) seems to have been reaffirmed.  When the envelope turns out to contain a lengthy love letter she doesn't become angry or disappointed, just confused.In addition to Leigh and Young, powerful performances are turned in by Jerry Orbach (the corrupt union boss), Stephen Lang (the closet homosexual strike-line foreman), Stephen Baldwin (a street punk), Ricki Lake (Big Joe's very pregnant daughter), and Alexis Arquette (the teen-age transvestite).The soundtrack is excellent and unobtrusive and Uli Edel's direction insightful.  You need a strong stomach to watch it and quite a bit of dedication to find it, but it's well worth the effort.Calvertbill",5,The Opposite of Pleasantville,1130198400,"10 25, 2005",2005,2004,"['Did', 'ever', 'notice', 'were', 'show', 'film', 'dinner', 'friends', 'too', 'often', 'what', 'bring', 'out', 'work', 'might', 'not', 'make', 'list', 'personal', 'top', 'ten', 'favorite', 'movies', 'one', 'films', 'Very', 'postwar', 'early', '50', '1950', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'truly', 'opposite', 'Pleasantville.Hubert', 'Selby', 'dark', 'vision', 'common', 'man', 'woven', 'several', 'characters', 'Brooklyn', 'neighborhood', 'factory', 'worker', 'called', 'Big', 'Joe', 'played', 'Burt', 'Young', 'Instinctively', 'brutal', 'yet', 'pathetically', 'naive', 'Brooklyn', 'neighborhood', 'functioning', 'most', 'elemental', 'level', 'reinforced', 'only', 'inherited', 'value', 'system', 'single-mindedly', 'loyal', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'whore', 'timeline', 'thoughts', 'future', 'out', 'only', 'several', 'hours', 'life', 'rolling', 'drunks', 'tolerance', 'liquor', 'less', 'hers', 'giving', 'sex', 'who', 'outlast', 'soldier', 'soon', 'be', 'shipped', 'out', 'Manhattan', 'last', 'few', 'stateside', 'days', 'falls', 'love', 'Tralala', 'Leigh', 'character', 'attendant', 'lust', 'clue', 'implications', 'love', 'off', 'Lieutenant', 'envelope', 'Tra', 'face', 'up', 'vision', 'order', 'life', 'sex', 'good', 'time', 'money', 'have', 'been', 'reaffirmed', 'When', 'envelope', 'out', 'contain', 'lengthy', 'love', 'letter', ""n't"", 'become', 'angry', 'disappointed', 'just', 'confused.In', 'addition', 'Leigh', 'Young', 'powerful', 'performances', 'are', 'turned', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'corrupt', 'union', 'boss', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'closet', 'homosexual', 'strike-line', 'foreman', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'street', 'punk', 'Ricki', 'Lake', 'Big', 'Joe', 'very', 'pregnant', 'daughter', 'Alexis', 'Arquette', 'teen-age', 'transvestite', '.The', 'soundtrack', 'excellent', 'unobtrusive', 'Uli', 'Edel', 'direction', 'insightful', 'need', 'strong', 'stomach', 'watch', 'quite', 'bit', 'dedication', 'find', 'well', 'effort.Calvertbill']",Last Exit to Brooklyn VHS
271139,A2ZKEBPCKEHDGL,6301868684,C McGhee,"[3, 5]","Last Exit to Brooklyn-A movie that could of been great but wound up only being good & the description at imdb is as much wrong as it is right. Set in the Early 50's in Brooklyn it follows the actions, often without consequences, of a new Union Strike building leader who is unhappy at home with his wife & kids & takes homosexuality as his road out. It also follows a prostitute that has a small gang that rolls her customers for her. A family man played by Burt Young of Rocky fame has difficulty adjusting to his daughters pregnancy & Jerry Orbach makes an appearance, in astounding realism, as the Head of the Local for the union.Unfortunately the gang appears first in the show & they are toons. I expected to see them break out into song & dance like in Westside Story's Officer Krupke. It ruined the first half of this very dark & gritty movie for me. Once I got over that I realized that this probably plays better for an East Coast dweller rather a central US dweller like myself. The music is haunting, enjoyable & contrasts amazingly well with the visual images. No rating now I'll give it another look later.Overall it's a great cast with Jennifer Jason Leigh playing the prostitute in a manner that shows why I love her acting so much. Stephen Baldwin, Stephen Lang, Rikki Lake, Peter Dobson & Sam Rockwell appear also. I liked the show but I'm not certain how much. It's worth at least one viewing if for nothing else but JJL, Orbach & the music.",3,Dark gritty humanity,1323043200,"12 5, 2011",2011,1459,"['Last', 'Exit', 'Brooklyn-A', 'movie', 'could', 'been', 'great', 'wound', 'up', 'only', 'being', 'good', 'description', 'imdb', 'as', 'much', 'right', 'Set', 'Early', '50', 'Brooklyn', 'actions', 'often', 'consequences', 'new', 'Union', 'Strike', 'building', 'leader', 'who', 'unhappy', 'home', 'wife', 'kids', 'homosexuality', 'road', 'out', 'also', 'prostitute', 'small', 'gang', 'customers', 'family', 'man', 'played', 'Burt', 'Young', 'Rocky', 'fame', 'difficulty', 'adjusting', 'daughters', 'pregnancy', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'appearance', 'astounding', 'realism', 'Head', 'Local', 'union.Unfortunately', 'gang', 'first', 'show', 'are', 'toons', 'expected', 'see', 'break', 'out', 'song', 'dance', 'Westside', 'Story', 'Officer', 'Krupke', 'ruined', 'first', 'half', 'very', 'dark', 'gritty', 'movie', 'Once', 'got', 'realized', 'probably', 'better', 'East', 'Coast', 'dweller', 'rather', 'central', 'US', 'dweller', 'music', 'haunting', 'enjoyable', 'contrasts', 'amazingly', 'well', 'visual', 'images', 'rating', 'now', ""'ll"", 'give', 'look', 'great', 'cast', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'playing', 'prostitute', 'manner', 'why', 'love', 'acting', 'so', 'much', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'Rikki', 'Lake', 'Peter', 'Dobson', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'appear', 'also', 'liked', 'show', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'how', 'much', 'worth', 'least', 'one', 'viewing', 'nothing', 'else', 'JJL', 'Orbach', 'music']",Last Exit to Brooklyn VHS

271145,A3GJUCDUNWPEG0,6301868684,kevin yee,"[6, 6]","Over the summer I purchased and read Hubert Selby Jr.'s ""Last Exit to Brooklyn"". It was the first book I had read for pleasure since high school. I also only bought it because the film Requiem for a Dream was astonishing, and because it wasnt at that particular bookstore. Anywho, I read LETB in about a week, which is super fast for me, and was intrigued enough to go out and watch the film.I had never heard of Uli Edel but was curious to see how well the book was illustrated through film. From the opening shot of the three military men walking through the dark streets to the Greeks to the factory to the strike office, things seemed to have been pulled straight from the book. If you have read the book you know how it can be sometimes quite difficult to read Selby's writing style, considering there are pages upon pages of text in all caps and run-on sentences up the wazoo, so a visual illustration really did a good job of bringing some confusing parts of the book to life.Jennifer Jason Leigh gave a good performance as the infamous Tralala, Jerry Orbach was always refreshing to watch, but I think I liked the portrayal of Harry Black the best (I think it was Stephen Lang). As in the book, his ""chapter"", along with Tralala's, were the longest, and the two characters were also the most intertwined in the other stories, so they also got a majority of the screen time in the film. Oh, and Burt Young was well cast, too. He seems to thrive on the grumpy-caring-jerk-semi womanizer type character quite well.I know others who have read the book or seen the movie have been put off by its unflattering portrait of the Brooklyn working class 60 years ago. Im only 22, and not the biggest history buff, so because of my little knowledge of the time I really cant form an opinion of how well it interprets the people and the places, or if much of it was dramatized, or if the stories told just represented a handful of the population in Brooklyn. But regradless, I enjoyed the less than perfect lifestyle and the struggles and sacrifices our characters endured to achieve their goals. I live near an upper middle class area, so lots of people take things for granted, and I think thats why Im drawn to these types of books and films.But anyway, I liked this film; and I liked the book, too. Its not one of those films (or books) that you can watch or read everyday because the content strikes like a hammer and stays with you long after, kind of like Requiem, but I feel I am a better person for experiencing ""Last Exit to Brooklyn"".",5,"Well made, but probably more enjoyable for Selby fans",1097193600,"10 8, 2004",2004,2540,"['summer', 'purchased', 'read', 'Hubert', 'Selby', 'Jr.', 'Last', 'Exit', 'Brooklyn', 'was', 'first', 'book', 'had', 'read', 'pleasure', 'high', 'school', 'also', 'only', 'bought', 'film', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'was', 'astonishing', 'particular', 'bookstore', 'Anywho', 'read', 'LETB', 'about', 'week', 'super', 'fast', 'was', 'intrigued', 'enough', 'go', 'out', 'watch', 'film.I', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'Uli', 'Edel', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'book', 'was', 'illustrated', 'film', 'opening', 'shot', 'three', 'military', 'men', 'walking', 'dark', 'streets', 'Greeks', 'factory', 'strike', 'office', 'things', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'pulled', 'straight', 'book', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'know', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'sometimes', 'quite', 'difficult', 'read', 'Selby', 'writing', 'style', 'considering', 'are', 'pages', 'pages', 'text', 'caps', 'run-on', 'sentences', 'up', 'wazoo', 'visual', 'illustration', 'really', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'bringing', 'confusing', 'parts', 'book', 'life.Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'gave', 'good', 'performance', 'infamous', 'Tralala', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'was', 'always', 'refreshing', 'watch', 'think', 'liked', 'portrayal', 'Harry', 'Black', 'best', 'think', 'was', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'book', 'chapter', 'Tralala', 'were', 'longest', 'two', 'characters', 'were', 'also', 'most', 'intertwined', 'other', 'stories', 'also', 'got', 'majority', 'screen', 'time', 'film', 'Oh', 'Burt', 'Young', 'was', 'well', 'cast', 'too', 'thrive', 'grumpy-caring-jerk-semi', 'womanizer', 'type', 'character', 'quite', 'well.I', 'know', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'seen', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'off', 'unflattering', 'portrait', 'Brooklyn', 'working', 'class', '60', 'years', 'ago', 'Im', 'only', '22', 'not', 'biggest', 'history', 'buff', 'so', 'little', 'knowledge', 'time', 'really', 'cant', 'form', 'opinion', 'how', 'well', 'people', 'places', 'much', 'was', 'dramatized', 'stories', 'told', 'just', 'represented', 'handful', 'population', 'Brooklyn', 'regradless', 'enjoyed', 'less', 'perfect', 'lifestyle', 'struggles', 'sacrifices', 'characters', 'endured', 'achieve', 'goals', 'live', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'area', 'lots', 'people', 'take', 'things', 'granted', 'think', 'thats', 'why', 'Im', 'drawn', 'types', 'books', 'films.But', 'anyway', 'liked', 'film', 'liked', 'book', 'too', 'not', 'one', 'films', 'books', 'can', 'watch', 'read', 'everyday', 'content', 'strikes', 'hammer', 'stays', 'long', 'kind', 'like', 'Requiem', 'feel', 'am', 'better', 'person', 'experiencing', 'Last', 'Exit', 'Brooklyn']",Last Exit to Brooklyn VHS

271157,A2WSI8HOWHFDOT,6301868684,Rocco Dormarunno,"[42, 46]","It's the 1950s. Under President Eisenhower's administration, everyone has a house in the suburbs, a decent job, a gas-guzzling car, and a basic ""Leave It to Beaver"" lifestyle.Not so, said Hubert Selby, in his novel, LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN. For a good deal of the working class, times were still tough. Preyed upon by crime, toyed with by factory owners and unions, and, ultimately, shackled by their own ignorance, the working class had their promise of a white picket fence and primrose garden vacated. In Brooklyn, particularly, things were acutely tough. Manufacturing jobs were on a rapid decline, as companies moved out of town or out of state (which was why those companies remaining in Brooklyn were able to mess with their employees: take it or leave it, was their attitude). At the same time, an influx of immigrants seeking jobs made the hunt for work even more competitive--another bonus for the remaining factory owners. Slums rapidly worsened, so much so that Dodger owner Walter Alston decided his team's future was in jeopardy. L.A. looked like a much safer place for a stadium.But neither Selby nor director Uli Edel portrayed this working class as merely innocent victims. Neither the book nor the film is a didactic rant about class warfare. The poor had their own vices of greed, brutality, and dissipation. Just about every other scene has someone going through someone else's wallets, union funds or pockets. If they aren't doing that, they're drinking, fighting, or whoring. It's a pretty dismal world. The natural response to this film might be: ""Wait a minute. Not everyone working class Johnny-Punchclock guy was a criminal. Most people worked hard and honestly."" Of course, this is true but it's not the film's concern. This is a study of those who were trapped in that world, and this study is compelling and horrifying.Uli Edel has perfectly captured this bleak world, either bathing everything in a garish light or obscuring it in heavy shadows. The performances are brilliant. There's no understating Jennifer Jason Leigh's gritty and powerful performance. Also keep an eye out for a cameo by Hubert Selby as the driver who hits Georgette. Not for the weak-stomached and definitely not for kids, LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN is as cinematographically close to the innermost circle of urban hell as you can get.",5,Why the Dodgers left Brooklyn,1082592000,"04 22, 2004",2004,2332,"['1950s', 'President', 'Eisenhower', 'administration', 'everyone', 'house', 'suburbs', 'decent', 'job', 'gas-guzzling', 'car', 'basic', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'lifestyle.Not', 'so', 'said', 'Hubert', 'Selby', 'novel', 'LAST', 'EXIT', 'TO', 'BROOKLYN', 'good', 'deal', 'working', 'class', 'times', 'were', 'still', 'tough', 'Preyed', 'crime', 'toyed', 'factory', 'owners', 'unions', 'ultimately', 'shackled', 'own', 'ignorance', 'working', 'class', 'had', 'promise', 'white', 'picket', 'fence', 'primrose', 'garden', 'vacated', 'Brooklyn', 'particularly', 'things', 'were', 'acutely', 'tough', 'Manufacturing', 'jobs', 'were', 'rapid', 'decline', 'companies', 'moved', 'out', 'town', 'state', 'was', 'why', 'companies', 'remaining', 'Brooklyn', 'were', 'able', 'mess', 'employees', 'take', 'leave', 'was', 'attitude', 'same', 'time', 'influx', 'immigrants', 'seeking', 'jobs', 'made', 'hunt', 'work', 'even', 'more', 'competitive', 'bonus', 'remaining', 'factory', 'owners', 'Slums', 'rapidly', 'worsened', 'so', 'much', 'Dodger', 'owner', 'Walter', 'Alston', 'decided', 'team', 'future', 'was', 'jeopardy', 'L.A.', 'looked', 'much', 'safer', 'place', 'stadium.But', 'Selby', 'director', 'Uli', 'Edel', 'portrayed', 'working', 'class', 'merely', 'innocent', 'victims', 'book', 'film', 'didactic', 'rant', 'class', 'warfare', 'poor', 'had', 'own', 'vices', 'greed', 'brutality', 'dissipation', 'Just', 'other', 'scene', 'someone', 'going', 'someone', 'else', 'wallets', 'union', 'funds', 'pockets', 'are', ""n't"", 'doing', ""'re"", 'drinking', 'fighting', 'whoring', 'pretty', 'dismal', 'world', 'natural', 'response', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'Wait', 'minute', 'Not', 'everyone', 'working', 'class', 'Johnny-Punchclock', 'guy', 'was', 'criminal', 'Most', 'people', 'worked', 'hard', 'honestly', 'course', 'true', 'not', 'film', 'concern', 'study', 'who', 'were', 'trapped', 'world', 'study', 'compelling', 'horrifying.Uli', 'Edel', 'perfectly', 'captured', 'bleak', 'world', 'bathing', 'everything', 'garish', 'light', 'obscuring', 'heavy', 'shadows', 'performances', 'are', 'brilliant', 'understating', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'gritty', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Also', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'cameo', 'Hubert', 'Selby', 'driver', 'who', 'Georgette', 'Not', 'weak-stomached', 'definitely', 'not', 'kids', 'LAST', 'EXIT', 'TO', 'BROOKLYN', 'cinematographically', 'close', 'innermost', 'circle', 'urban', 'hell', 'can', 'get']",Last Exit to Brooklyn VHS
