Zach Braff is almost the same character in this movie. Going through some life crisis where he has to figure things out. Except in this movie, it's not nearly as brilliant or sympathetic. When I used to watch ""The O.C."", Rachel Bilson was my favorite female character (one because she was hot, two because she was cute) but I found her character in this movie to be QUITE annoying despite what she looks like.

1028419,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B000JLTRJA,B. Martin,"[2, 2]","The Last Kiss is a movie about relationships that wants to be seen as emotionally honest and insightful, but it focuses on too many couplings and the characters are so underdeveloped that it never leaves much of a mark.Zach Braff and Jacinda Barrett are the central couple, an attractive, successful pair who are having a child together even though he is afraid to committ to marriage.  When he cheats with a young college student (Rachel Bilson) their relationship takes a turn for the worse.  If the movie had just focused on this relationship, it might have been able to flesh out the two charcters a little bit more and we would have cared about whether or not they fixed things.  Instead, the movie gives equal amounts of time to other relationships including Blythe Danner and Tom Wilkinson as a couple married 30 years.  None of the relationships that is explored really provides much insight or packs any emotional punch.It's not unitl the end of the film, when Braff's character plants himself on his girlfriend's porch and refused to leave until she talks to him that the movie comes to life at all.  Braff does this after Tom Wilkinson's character tells him that in order to get her back he has to do ""whatever it takes"".

1028420,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000JLTRJA,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 3]","Having enjoyed Zach Braff in GARDEN STATE, most viewers will eagerly snatch-up a copy of THE LAST KISS to see how far this young actor has come. Needless to say, Braff is still in fine form as far as his acting goes. In fact, the entire ensemble cast is excellent (from Blythe Danner as the embittered and confused wife of Tom Wilkinson, to Michael Weston's predatory antics toward his ex-girlfriend played by Marley Shelton). But acting needs a strong story, and this is where The Last Kiss stumbles badly.Relationship stories are often the groundwork for the inevitable ""chick-flick."" But here the story is on five men and how each of them deals with the challenges of the interpersonal relationships with their significant others. If this sounds a tad boring, you're not wrong. It is. But, as stated at the beginning of this review, it's the strong acting that'll keep you watching.The film starts out at a wedding of one of the five, an idyllic scene that contrasts sharply between what the other four are going through. Izzy (Michael Weston) is depressed and weepy because his long-time girl recently broke up with him. He deals with this situation by refusing to believe its over and crying at a bachelor party while watching two lesbians ""go at it."" Chris (Casey Affleck) is a married man with a new baby. He and his wife constant argue, and this upsets the baby who cries nonstop. Realizing that ""something"" has to happen, Chris takes the plunge and leaves his wife. Kenny (Eric Christian Olsen) is the penultimate bachelor, working at a bar and getting laid on a regular basis. He can't (or won't) commit to anything resembling a relationship. Then there's our main character Michael (Zach Braff), who's been involved in a three year relationship with the perfect girl (who's also pregnant now). He's worried that his life is over, that nothing more is in store for him. No more surprises. His life is laid out for him. Until...Michael meets up with a sexy college co-ed named Kim (Rachel Bilson) who takes an immediate liking to him. The forbidden fruit dangles in front of Michael and one night he decides to pluck it, forgetting that this might permanently damage his three year relationship with his probable future wife. And, of course, it does do serious damage. Can he fix it? Are there still surprises left for Michael? Or should he reserve his life to that of commonality?And this is basically the entire premise of the flick. Although ""interesting"" it most certainly isn't engaging to ponder (at least not from a ""guy"" standpoint).Relationship stories are just too blah! to keep being resurrected time and again, and this is why The Last Kiss falters so badly. If it weren't for the stellar cast, this one would easily be forgettable and nearly unwatchable. But as it stands now, it's just barely worth your viewing time.",3,"Squeaks By As A Watchable ""Guy"" Romance",1168041600,"01 6, 2007",2007,2840,"['Having', 'enjoyed', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'GARDEN', 'STATE', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'eagerly', 'snatch-up', 'copy', 'THE', 'LAST', 'KISS', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'young', 'actor', 'come', 'Needless', 'say', 'Braff', 'still', 'fine', 'form', 'as', 'far', 'acting', 'fact', 'entire', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'excellent', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'embittered', 'confused', 'wife', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Michael', 'Weston', 'predatory', 'antics', 'ex-girlfriend', 'played', 'Marley', 'Shelton', 'acting', 'strong', 'story', 'where', 'Last', 'Kiss', 'stumbles', 'badly.Relationship', 'stories', 'are', 'often', 'groundwork', 'inevitable', 'chick-flick', 'here', 'story', 'five', 'men', 'how', 'deals', 'challenges', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'significant', 'others', 'tad', 'boring', ""'re"", 'not', 'wrong', 'stated', 'beginning', 'review', 'strong', 'acting', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'watching.The', 'film', 'out', 'wedding', 'one', 'five', 'idyllic', 'scene', 'sharply', 'what', 'other', 'four', 'are', 'going', 'Izzy', 'Michael', 'Weston', 'depressed', 'weepy', 'long-time', 'girl', 'recently', 'broke', 'up', 'situation', 'refusing', 'believe', 'crying', 'bachelor', 'party', 'watching', 'two', 'lesbians', 'go', 'Chris', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'married', 'man', 'new', 'baby', 'wife', 'constant', 'argue', 'baby', 'who', 'nonstop', 'Realizing', 'something', 'happen', 'Chris', 'plunge', 'wife', 'Kenny', 'Eric', 'Christian', 'Olsen', 'penultimate', 'bachelor', 'working', 'bar', 'getting', 'laid', 'regular', 'basis', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'commit', 'anything', 'resembling', 'relationship', 'Then', 'main', 'character', 'Michael', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'who', 'been', 'involved', 'three', 'year', 'relationship', 'perfect', 'girl', 'who', 'also', 'pregnant', 'now', 'worried', 'life', 'nothing', 'more', 'store', 'more', 'surprises', 'life', 'laid', 'out', 'Michael', 'up', 'sexy', 'college', 'co-ed', 'named', 'Kim', 'Rachel', 'Bilson', 'who', 'immediate', 'liking', 'forbidden', 'fruit', 'dangles', 'front', 'Michael', 'one', 'night', 'pluck', 'forgetting', 'might', 'permanently', 'damage', 'three', 'year', 'relationship', 'probable', 'future', 'wife', 'course', 'do', 'serious', 'damage', 'Can', 'fix', 'Are', 'still', 'left', 'Michael', 'should', 'reserve', 'life', 'commonality', 'basically', 'entire', 'premise', 'flick', 'interesting', 'most', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'engaging', 'ponder', 'least', 'not', 'guy', 'standpoint', '.Relationship', 'stories', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'blah', 'keep', 'being', 'resurrected', 'time', 'again', 'why', 'Last', 'Kiss', 'falters', 'so', 'badly', 'were', ""n't"", 'stellar', 'cast', 'one', 'would', 'easily', 'be', 'forgettable', 'nearly', 'unwatchable', 'now', 'just', 'barely', 'worth', 'viewing', 'time']",N/A
1028421,AXKLJRDTPJCA7,B000JLTRJA,Boss Fan,"[3, 3]","I don't think you can really appreciate a movie like ""The Last Kiss"" unless you have lived through some situation similar to those in the film, or have had some of the same doubts and hardships these characters here do.  People who have never experienced any of this, are too far removed from it, and/or just too cynical will probably not ""get it"" (like the reviewer before me).  I happened to watch this today, sight unseen (enjoying Zach Braff on ""Scrubs"" and in ""Garden State"" was about the only motivation I had to grab this one, while I would typically leave similar looking romantic dramas on the shelf), after a night out with a long-time friend in which we discussed many of the same fears, doubts and problems as the characters in this movie.So, due to the timing, it home.  But I think it would have anyway.  I am the same age as Braff's character and have been put in similar different compromising positions.  I even have friends and family like the ones portrayed here.  Now, granted, this is a Hollywood production so a lot of the elements that might have been more honest and real had the filmmakers dialed them back to their more simple, true-to-life core, instead are  broad and obvious so as to make sure the audience doesn't have to think to much about, or question, what's going on.  Also, the solutions to many of the character's plights are little too neat and tidy, but, in defense, I would argue, we all know those make-up/break-up couples, so maybe some of this is not so far-fetched.Regardless, I consider these things to be minor quibbles; I mean, a movie only has two hours in which give the audience some closure of it's characters; we can't sit and watch an entire several-year on-and-off relationship play out.But if there was one real problem I had with the film it was some of the ancillary characters and the way they are written.  Braff's girlfriend's parents experiencing their own late-life doubts about marriage is meant to show some sort of parallel to the younger characters problems.  Maybe the lesson is that just because you've been married for years doesn't mean you can settle into mediocrity, or perhaps it's the writers pessimistic view that the doubts and problems young people have in relationships will dog them the rest of their life. Hey, marriage takes work. But by the end, it's clear that the parent characters and their drama just serves as a way for Braff to learn from his mistakes and for them to offer their words of wisdom so they might make a happy ending for Braff and their daughter - and, of course, thereby, themselves.  What was an honest and almost uncomfortably realistic drama (again, if you can relate to this or have been through any of this) for over half the film, turns into a series of clich&eacute;s and maddening lapses in logic in its final third.  An abrupt ending doesn't help either.But the saving grace in ""The Last Kiss,"" besides the all-around terrific performances, is the writing.  Unlike a lot of Hollywood films of this type, these characters talk the way people actually talk.  That may seem like a simple feat, but it is so rare and such a pleasure to come across.  It has been a while since I have seen a movie in which I could so greatly relate to the people in it, and the characters had conversations the way people I know have conversations.But be warned: this is not a good date movie.  Guys, take a girl to this and you will be shooting your self straight in the foot.  But if you have some alone time and you need some reflection on where your post-college life is headed, need to feel like you are not alone in many of your doubts and fears, or just want to appreciate (two thirds of) an extremely well-written and honest look at life and relationships, check this one out.",4,"Honest, well written and performed, but mared by cliches and unneed sub-plots/characters.",1171756800,"02 18, 2007",2007,3773,"['do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'really', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'Last', 'Kiss', 'have', 'lived', 'situation', 'similar', 'film', 'have', 'had', 'same', 'doubts', 'hardships', 'characters', 'here', 'do', 'People', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'experienced', 'are', 'too', 'far', 'removed', 'and/or', 'just', 'too', 'cynical', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'get', 'reviewer', 'happened', 'watch', 'today', 'sight', 'unseen', 'enjoying', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'Scrubs', 'Garden', 'State', 'was', 'only', 'motivation', 'had', 'grab', 'one', 'would', 'typically', 'leave', 'similar', 'looking', 'romantic', 'dramas', 'shelf', 'night', 'out', 'long-time', 'friend', 'discussed', 'many', 'same', 'fears', 'doubts', 'problems', 'characters', 'movie.So', 'due', 'timing', 'home', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'anyway', 'am', 'same', 'age', 'Braff', 'character', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'similar', 'different', 'compromising', 'positions', 'even', 'have', 'friends', 'family', 'ones', 'portrayed', 'here', 'Now', 'granted', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'so', 'lot', 'elements', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'honest', 'real', 'had', 'filmmakers', 'dialed', 'back', 'more', 'simple', 'true-to-life', 'core', 'instead', 'are', 'broad', 'obvious', 'so', 'make', 'sure', 'audience', ""n't"", 'have', 'think', 'much', 'question', 'what', 'going', 'Also', 'solutions', 'many', 'character', 'plights', 'are', 'little', 'too', 'neat', 'tidy', 'defense', 'would', 'argue', 'know', 'make-up/break-up', 'couples', 'maybe', 'not', 'so', 'far-fetched.Regardless', 'consider', 'things', 'be', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'mean', 'movie', 'only', 'two', 'hours', 'give', 'audience', 'closure', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sit', 'watch', 'entire', 'several-year', 'on-and-off', 'relationship', 'play', 'out.But', 'was', 'one', 'real', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'ancillary', 'characters', 'way', 'are', 'written', 'Braff', 'girlfriend', 'parents', 'experiencing', 'own', 'late-life', 'doubts', 'marriage', 'meant', 'show', 'sort', 'parallel', 'younger', 'characters', 'problems', 'Maybe', 'lesson', 'just', ""'ve"", 'been', 'married', 'years', ""n't"", 'mean', 'can', 'settle', 'mediocrity', 'perhaps', 'writers', 'pessimistic', 'view', 'doubts', 'problems', 'young', 'people', 'have', 'relationships', 'will', 'dog', 'rest', 'life', 'Hey', 'marriage', 'work', 'end', 'clear', 'parent', 'characters', 'drama', 'just', 'way', 'Braff', 'learn', 'mistakes', 'offer', 'words', 'wisdom', 'might', 'make', 'happy', 'ending', 'Braff', 'daughter', 'course', 'thereby', 'What', 'was', 'honest', 'almost', 'uncomfortably', 'realistic', 'drama', 'again', 'can', 'relate', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'series', 'clich', 'eacute', 'maddening', 'lapses', 'logic', 'final', 'third', 'abrupt', 'ending', ""n't"", 'help', 'either.But', 'saving', 'grace', 'Last', 'Kiss', 'all-around', 'terrific', 'performances', 'writing', 'lot', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'type', 'characters', 'talk', 'way', 'people', 'actually', 'talk', 'may', 'seem', 'simple', 'feat', 'so', 'rare', 'such', 'pleasure', 'come', 'been', 'while', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'could', 'so', 'greatly', 'relate', 'people', 'characters', 'had', 'conversations', 'way', 'people', 'know', 'have', 'conversations.But', 'be', 'warned', 'not', 'good', 'date', 'movie', 'Guys', 'take', 'girl', 'will', 'be', 'shooting', 'self', 'straight', 'foot', 'have', 'alone', 'time', 'need', 'reflection', 'where', 'post-college', 'life', 'headed', 'need', 'feel', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'many', 'doubts', 'fears', 'just', 'want', 'appreciate', 'two', 'thirds', 'extremely', 'well-written', 'honest', 'look', 'life', 'relationships', 'check', 'one', 'out']",N/A

1028423,A8TM0MI3D9T29,B000JLTRJA,Brett Corkins,"[3, 4]","With The Last Kiss we have yet another movie that was marketed wrong. Given what was presented in the previews upon its release most of us were led to believe it'd be a pretty funny movie. Not so. There are parts where you laugh a bit but this is much more in the vein of an actual drama than anything else. So going in expecting a drama would work wonders in your post-viewing conversations. Had they marketed it that way I think it would've been recieved a lot better than it originally was.I won't lie, what led me to wanting to see The Last Kiss rested solely on Zach Braff's shoulders. He's excellent in Scrubs and, while it took getting use to, he really pulled off the serious/depressed role that Garden State called for with flying colors. ""How bad can The Last Kiss possibly be?"" I was left wondering. Not too shabby it turns out. I'm a guy and I'm comfortable in saying that I can thoroughly enjoy myself whilst watching a 'chick flick.' That's exactly what The Last Kiss is and it's not ashamed of that one bit.Everyone knows the plot...a 29 year-old has everything he wanted. A great job, an amazing girlfriend, great friends. He can't help but think by following through with this life that there won't be anymore surprises. Enter Rachel Bilson. She turns his world upside down and he finds himself questioning just what it is he really wants. Sounds good right? I thought so too. Heck, even throwing in the fact that his friends are having serious domestic problems as well was okay with me. But I could not stand the storyline following Blythe Danner and how she pretty much ruins her marriage because her husband doesn't look at her like ""he has to have her."" Take that out and this movie would have been darn near perfect.As for the rest of the cast, there's no real glaring fault. Surprisingly enough, even Rachel Bilson was really good in her role which I simply didn't expect. It comes as no surprise though that Zach Braff stole every scene he was in. The chemistry between him and Jacinda Barrett was great and seeing Zach walk into situations he should've known better than to walk into gives this movie that human touch.Basically, if you hate chick flicks don't even think about watching this. If you don't mind a chick flick though and are looking for a movie where even though the lead actor messes up time after time and you're left yelling at your TV yet you still want him to end up with her, you just found that movie.",4,I'll sit on this porch until you talk to me...(4.5),1182816000,"06 26, 2007",2007,2448,"['Last', 'Kiss', 'have', 'yet', 'movie', 'was', 'marketed', 'wrong', 'Given', 'what', 'was', 'presented', 'previews', 'release', 'most', 'were', 'led', 'believe', ""'d"", 'be', 'pretty', 'funny', 'movie', 'Not', 'so', 'are', 'parts', 'where', 'bit', 'much', 'more', 'vein', 'actual', 'drama', 'anything', 'else', 'So', 'going', 'expecting', 'drama', 'would', 'work', 'wonders', 'post-viewing', 'conversations', 'Had', 'marketed', 'way', 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'recieved', 'lot', 'better', 'originally', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lie', 'what', 'led', 'wanting', 'see', 'Last', 'Kiss', 'rested', 'solely', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'shoulders', 'excellent', 'Scrubs', 'took', 'getting', 'use', 'really', 'pulled', 'off', 'serious/depressed', 'role', 'Garden', 'State', 'called', 'flying', 'colors', 'How', 'bad', 'can', 'Last', 'Kiss', 'possibly', 'be', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'Not', 'too', 'shabby', 'out', ""'m"", 'guy', ""'m"", 'comfortable', 'saying', 'can', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'whilst', 'watching', ""'chick"", 'flick', 'exactly', 'what', 'Last', 'Kiss', 'not', 'ashamed', 'one', 'bit.Everyone', 'plot', '29', 'year-old', 'everything', 'wanted', 'A', 'great', 'job', 'amazing', 'girlfriend', 'great', 'friends', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'following', 'life', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'anymore', 'surprises', 'Enter', 'Rachel', 'Bilson', 'world', 'upside', 'down', 'questioning', 'just', 'what', 'really', 'Sounds', 'good', 'right', 'thought', 'so', 'too', 'Heck', 'even', 'throwing', 'fact', 'friends', 'are', 'having', 'serious', 'domestic', 'problems', 'well', 'was', 'okay', 'could', 'not', 'stand', 'storyline', 'following', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'how', 'pretty', 'much', 'marriage', 'husband', ""n't"", 'look', 'have', 'Take', 'out', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'darn', 'perfect.As', 'rest', 'cast', 'real', 'glaring', 'fault', 'Surprisingly', 'enough', 'even', 'Rachel', 'Bilson', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'role', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'surprise', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'stole', 'scene', 'was', 'chemistry', 'Jacinda', 'Barrett', 'was', 'great', 'seeing', 'Zach', 'walk', 'situations', 'should', ""'ve"", 'known', 'better', 'walk', 'movie', 'human', 'touch.Basically', 'hate', 'chick', 'flicks', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'chick', 'flick', 'are', 'looking', 'movie', 'where', 'even', 'lead', 'actor', 'up', 'time', 'time', ""'re"", 'left', 'yelling', 'TV', 'yet', 'still', 'want', 'end', 'up', 'just', 'found', 'movie']",N/A

Things get depressing in ""The Last Kiss"" and rightfully so, because whats love without the downfall.A very good film that is getting a bad wrap from viewers who didnt know any better before viewing. If you you like films that make you think about life no matter how dark is may get, this film is for you.Also check out the wonderful soundtrack that is a great companion piece to the film. Some of the songs are great and actually answer some questions you have about the ending. Nice touch.This isnt a 5 star movie, im only giving it 5 to boost the rating.

It's definitely in the same vein as Garden State.  By showing relationships in different stages, this movie points out the difficulties one faces when in a pair and the sacrificies one must make for either a partner or child.  Much like Garden State, it provides an almost philosophy in the film, gives great quote after great quote, and, though it wraps up the storylines, doesn't necessarily give that swelling of orchestra happy ending that most romantic comedies do.***Spoilers***However, what I wanted to say here and in particular in response to a previous review by Forrester, the portrayal of women in this film does certainly fall in line with the traditional ""female"" role but not necessarily real women.  While I may be the commitmentphobe and therefore empathized with Braff until his indiscretion, let it be stated that not all women are ditzy college girls desperately running after taken men or baby seeking marriage craving women.Furthermore, one can empathize with Affleck's wife in the film.  While both certainly need marriage counseling, her behavior is not so crazy given the possibility for post partem and the very real experience of no longer being a person but instead being a mother.  Staying at home with the kids is not the bon bon eating, soap opera watching experience some would paint it is.  While Affleck certainly did not deserve to be constantly castigated and should have been given a chance to be a father, let's not denigrate the role of women as mothers or generalize all new mothers to be ""insane"" or ""unreasonable.""Thus, despite my quibbles with the female portrayal, I take the film as an adequate and realistic portrayal of issues many deal with in their twenties as that big 3-0 approaches, whether it's babymaking and ring swapping or simply dealing with the notion of ""forever"" and mortality.GREAT MOVIE!!!",5,Realistic Romance.,1172448000,"02 26, 2007",2007,2108,"['have', 'say', 'film', 'other', 'romantic', 'dramas', 'are', 'realistic', 'instead', 'trying', 'angst', 'courtship', 'happiness', 'ever', 'fallible', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'make', 'mistakes', 'who', 'prosper', 'fail', 'who', 'try', 'give', 'up', 'definitely', 'same', 'vein', 'Garden', 'State', 'showing', 'relationships', 'different', 'stages', 'movie', 'out', 'difficulties', 'one', 'when', 'pair', 'sacrificies', 'one', 'must', 'make', 'partner', 'child', 'Much', 'Garden', 'State', 'almost', 'philosophy', 'film', 'great', 'quote', 'great', 'quote', 'up', 'storylines', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'give', 'swelling', 'orchestra', 'happy', 'ending', 'most', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'do', '***Spoilers***However', 'what', 'wanted', 'say', 'here', 'particular', 'response', 'previous', 'review', 'Forrester', 'portrayal', 'women', 'film', 'certainly', 'fall', 'line', 'traditional', 'female', 'role', 'not', 'necessarily', 'real', 'women', 'may', 'be', 'commitmentphobe', 'therefore', 'empathized', 'Braff', 'indiscretion', 'let', 'be', 'stated', 'not', 'women', 'are', 'ditzy', 'college', 'girls', 'desperately', 'running', 'taken', 'men', 'baby', 'seeking', 'marriage', 'craving', 'women.Furthermore', 'one', 'can', 'empathize', 'Affleck', 'wife', 'film', 'certainly', 'need', 'marriage', 'counseling', 'behavior', 'not', 'so', 'crazy', 'given', 'possibility', 'post', 'partem', 'very', 'real', 'experience', 'longer', 'being', 'person', 'instead', 'being', 'mother', 'Staying', 'home', 'kids', 'not', 'bon', 'bon', 'eating', 'soap', 'opera', 'watching', 'experience', 'would', 'paint', 'Affleck', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'deserve', 'be', 'constantly', 'castigated', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'chance', 'be', 'father', 'let', 'not', 'denigrate', 'role', 'women', 'mothers', 'generalize', 'new', 'mothers', 'be', 'insane', 'unreasonable', 'Thus', 'quibbles', 'female', 'portrayal', 'take', 'film', 'adequate', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'issues', 'many', 'deal', 'twenties', 'big', '3-0', 'approaches', 'babymaking', 'ring', 'swapping', 'simply', 'dealing', 'notion', 'forever', 'mortality.GREAT', 'MOVIE']",N/A

However, I thought that overall, this was a very good movie. It's like a slightly more adult Garden State. I think this movie embodies what people are beginning to call the ""quarter life crisis"" - that is, the realization that you're not in your early twenties anymore and it's time to grow up. This is what Zach Braff's character is struggling with in this movie. It is basically the story of a man unsure whether or not he's ready to settle down, and when his girlfriend becomes pregnant, he feels like he's forced to make that choice. Unfortunately, he makes a few mistakes on the path of finding his answer.The music was wonderful in this movie and I highly recommend the soundtrack. I also thought that the acting was exceptional all around as was the film style. My only complaint is that it somewhat says that ""cheating is o.k.""

He helped with Million Dollar Baby, Flags of Our Fathers, this and even Japanese languaged Letters from Iwo Jiwa. Since I found him unbelievably overrated, could that have been the reason why I only partially liked the Last Kiss since the subject matter is actually well chosen but the presentation and writing of it just completely crumbles it before it even gets going. To that end, this is another case of a good theme for the film to be in just not a well-written one.We follow several relationships (and strangely forget about half) but the main thread is Michael and Jenna, a young almost-30 couple who are going to have a baby. This is causing Michael worry since now his life is planned out: no more surprises, nothing new and a feeling of repetitiveness. This of course is worsened by Kim, a young college girl who he starts falling for which is of course a bad thing.Then of course there's relationships all around them such as Chris who is in a marriage where his wife drives him nuts thanks to the new baby, another who prefers one-night stands over commitment, one who turns almost stalker-ish then we have Jenna's parents who after 30 years of marriage, aren't exactly eye-to-eye either.Literally everybody has a big deal in the film. In the same way Crash tried to cram as much characters dealing with racism in any form, there's not a single normal relationship in the bunch and what's worse is that we don't really care for any of them, especially the non Michael/Jenna ones. Lauren Lee Smith, who's quickly becoming one of my favorite actresses so far, is barely on screen and Marley Shelton might as well be a cameo. And a character's frequent one night stand completely disappears at one point. In fact once Michael makes a mistake I don't think everyone else shows up until the end. Not to mention the writing is a bit too convenient and obviously decide to tell the story rather than it being natural or letting us care. In essence, the characters all become ways to tell the story and that's it like they're detached from everything.As far as the acting is concerned, again it's quite commendable even though the tone is always too on the nose (another Crash-like problem) the acting is fine including Zach Braff, Rachel Bilson, Lauren Lee Smith, Casey Affleck as well as Jenna's parents played by Tom Wilkinson and Blythe Danner. Also attention paid to the soundtrack where I literally had to look up songs since I was starting to like them. Curiously, songs like Coldplay's show better relationship dilemnas than the film did.Is it worth a watch? Sure, there's enough honesty in certain scenes and the acting is worth it but when a character does something stupid and we spend the rest of the film following along, we kind of feel like ""oh come on, kick him out already"".

Some people welcome the change which is forever but many are scared to know that their lives will change and to what will change to, it's fear that can cause many people to do unfortunate (or for some...""fortunate"") things.""THE LAST KISS"" is a film released in US theaters in 2006 and is based on a popular 2001 Italian film titled ""L'ultimo Bacio"" (originally directed and written by Gabriele Muccino).  The film is directed by actor Tony Goldwyn (""Ghost"", ""The Last Samurai"", ""Bounce"") and a screenplay by Paul Haggis (""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Crash"") and features a talented young cast.The film focuses on the lives of Michael (Zach Braff) and his girlfriend Jenna (Jacinda Barrett), a couple who have been dating since they were in college and now several years into their relationship, they are having a baby.For Michael, having a baby is a big step for their relationship and feels his life has been planned out.  Going to college, finding a girl, getting a job, having a child, getting house, marriage and living happily ever after.  But he feels that his life has been ho hum with no surprises.Michael and Jenna meet up with Jenna's parents who have been married for 30-years.  Anna (Blythe Danner) and Stephen (Tom Wilkinson) may seem like a perfect couple but deep down, Anna is unhappy.  In fact, she's quite jealous with the life that her daughter has.Meanwhile, his friend Mark (David Jones) is getting married to his perfect girl but for his friends, it's a totally different situation.  His friend Izzy (Michael Weston) has been dumped by his high school sweetheart and is having a hard time dealing with it, his friend Chris (Casey Affleck) is having difficulties in his relationship and so he and his girlfriend have a child in hopes that their relationship will improve but it has been quite the opposite.  Things are much worse.  And for his friend  Kenny (Eric Christian Olsen), still living a laid-back lifestyle with no commitments to any woman.  But for Michael, having a baby with Jenna is life changing and is feeling a bit scared about his life.As the friends celebrate Mark's wedding, Michael notices a woman staring at him.  While taking a walk, he runs into Kim (Rachel Bilson), a lively college student and the two talk and automatically they have chemistry.But things start to change for Michael and Jenna.  Jenna's mother Anna leaves her father and we learn that she has had an affair with an old flame, Izzy and Kenny want to travel to another country and get away, Chris knows he wants to break off his relationship with his girlfriend but the fact that he has a young child gives him second thoughts.  But knows his relationship has to end.  For Jenna, it's a shock that everyone around them is having relationship problems and in her heart, she's just happy that things are good between her and Michael.As for Michael, he slowly becomes tempted by Kim that he goes to meet with her.  This is the beginning of Michael's descent of breaking away from his ""scripted life"" and embarking in unknown territory.Will Michael realize what he is doing is wrong?  Or will he be making the worst decision in his life?VIDEO & AUDIO:""THE LAST KISS"" gets the High Definition treatment with a Blu-ray release.  One of the first things you notice when comparing to the DVD is the amount of sharpness and color vibrancy.  Reds come out striking and beautiful, and since the film features a lot of outdoor scenes throughout Madison, Wisconsin, the blue skies, the blue lakes and overall, the colors really pop.As for the audio, you get a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 which is front heavy and the film is primarily dialogue but there is some subwoofer usage during the musical segments throughout the film.  For a film based on relationships, it's primarily an audio-driven film.  I didn't recall anything special coming from the rear surrounds but overall, the music really comes out quite nicely through the film's soundtrack and dialogue is easily heard.  There is Dolby Digital 5.1 dub tracks in French, Spanish and German.Subtitles are featured in English, English SDH, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""THE LAST KISS"" features the following special features in Standard Definition:* Commentary: Commentary by Zach Braff and director Tony Goldwyn - A more straightforward commentary by Goldwyn and Braff.  Where the other commentary is fun and chaotic, this commentary track is just straightforward, humorous and informative.  One of the fun interesting tidbits from the film is during the first driving scene with Braff and Bilson and how they were followed by 40 young hardcore fans of Rachel Bilson's ""The O.C."" character and were screaming for her.* Commentary: Commentary by Zach Braff, Tony Goldwyn, Jacinda Barrett, Rachel Bilson, Michael Weston and Eric Christian Olsen - Possibly one of the most lively commentaries with the talent just having fun, talking dirty, having conversations and just having a great time discussing certain scenes.  Of course, with everyone excited and talking over each other, it's actually a very fun commentary track.* The Last Kiss - Filmmakers' Perspective - (2:33) Interview with Producer Gary Luchessi and how he came to hiring Tony Goldwyn and interviews with Tony Goldwynn and how both men enjoyed the original Italian film ""L'Ultimo Bacio"".* The Last Kiss - Getting Together - (26:44) Interviews with producer Gary Lucchesi, screenwriter Paul Haggis, the casting of each talent, interviews with the talent and differences from the original Italian film and the US version.* The Last Kiss - Behind Our Favorite Scenes - (8:26) Tony Goldwyn talks about his favorite scenes in the film and certain differences from the original script and the final cut.  Scenes include the wedding scene, visiting Jenna's home and when Jenna's mother Anna secretly observes her husband and observes what he is doing during the evening.* The Last Kiss - Last Thoughts - (3:29) In this featurette, the cast of ""THE LAST KISS"" give their thoughts on what the film is about and how people can relate to it.* Music Video - Cary Brothers ""Ride"" performance version with Zach Braff Intro - A music video directed by Zach Braff.  Featuring a pretty cool acoustic guitar driven music video by the Cary Brothers.* Deleted Scenes: Around 14 minutes of deleted scenes which include the following extended and deleted scenes.  The most notable are the two alternate endings which were filmed.  One which features the character of Michael (Braff) playing with his daughter.  The second featuring what happens to Michael's friends Kenny and Izzy and similar ending to the alternate ending #1.* The Bachelor Party Extended* The Treehouse Scene Extended* Izzy & Arianna on the Phone* Chris & Lisa Fight in the Kitchen* Kim Chases Michael* Alternate Ending 1* Alternate Ending 2* Gag Reel - (2:44) Bloopers for ""THE LAST KISS""* Trailers: Theatrical Trailer - (2:34) The original theatrical trailerJUDGMENT CALL:""THE LAST KISS"" is a film that is wonderful and intimate film that I really enjoyed.Typically, there are films that deal with multiple relationships, especially when it comes from the female perspective.  What I enjoyed about ""THE LAST KISS"" is that it delves into the perspective of men and what you see on screen, is an honest depiction of what many men go through in the next stage of their lives.  Marriage and having children is never easy.  The changes that happen after marriage and children is never easy.  Having decades of commitment is never easy but it all comes down to the individual if they are going to be in it for the long haul or if they are going to succumb towards temptation.One of the amazing lines comes from Stephen (Tom Wilkinson) who is listening to what Michael (Braff) has to say about why he cheated.  About being scared and having this brunette come to his life and being attracted to him.  But Stephen saying that if you felt that way now, how you can tell it won't happen again because even though he's been married for over 30 years, he still has brunettes coming to him and attracted to him.  It's about how one deals with it.There are just some moments that I know many men who have watched this film and came away thinking, ""that guy is me"".  There are not enough films that deal with relationships especially in the male perspective, so it was quite wonderful to have a film like ""THE LAST KISS"".Zach Braff is just wonderful as Michael.  Your ""everyman"" who is like your average guy and he plays the part quite well.  Jacinda Barrett, who I remember during the MTV ""Real World London"" years, is also very good in this film.  Showcasing a wide range of emotions.  In fact, you learn a lot from the commentary of what Barrett was able to bring to the film.  Little things you probably never picked up between the couple in the initial first watch such as the two sitting in a couch and her hand and fingers going near Michael's crotch.  Little bits of improvisation that brought out these two characters.Rachel Bilson builds upon what she gave on the television series ""THE O.C."", she did such a tremendous job in her first major film role.  And Casey Affleck, Michael Weston and Eric Christian Olsen also do a great job with their roles.  Affleck for being the man in a troubled relationship, Weston as a man who is an emotional wreck and Olsen who had to do a multitude of nude scenes and love making in the film.  Each did a great job.And the veteran talent of Blythe Danner and Tom Wilkinson were well done.  I really enjoyed how the film focused on the late-20's or 30-something type of friendship but to also show a couple who have lasted for 30-years, show that nothing is ever perfect and even a long-lasting relationship has its troubles and how temptation can get the best of anyone, despite their age and how long their relationship has been.  Love is always fragile and can be made strong but with so many years passed, things change and if you let temptation come in or love not showing its importance as it was in a couple's earlier years, it's a quick way for love to easily be destroyed.  There is always a gray area and nothing is truly perfect but it's how a couple tries to overshadow that gray area with their love for each other and trying to keep things fresh and strong and that their is a mutual respect among each other, that is what ""THE LAST KISS"" tries to show.As for its Blu-ray release, this latest transfer is probably the best we are ever going to see of this film.  The original DVD came with so many features and two commentaries, that it was a jam-packed DVD release. The Blu-ray offers nothing new in terms of special features and the special features happen to be in Standard Definition.  So, if you own the DVD already, it just comes down to if you want to upgrade to a High Definition version or not.  Otherwise, there is no new content compared to the original DVD release.For those who have never watched this film and do not own the DVD, ""THE LAST KISS"" is a film that is worth checking out.  Especially for those who have relationship or marital problems, there is something that you may learn from the film.  Wonderful performances, a well-written script adapted from a magnificent Italian film and overall, a Blu-ray worth having in your collection.  Definitely give ""THE LAST KISS"" a try!",4,Blu-ray: Great picture and audio quality but nothing new added in the BD version compared to the DVD release.,1239753600,"04 15,

1028432,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B000JLTRJA,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[0, 1]","Here is a heart-wrenching movie about  a love triangle.  Mike (played by Zach Braff) is engaged to his girlfriend, Jenna (Jacinda Barrett).  Unfortunately, he has 2 problems.  One, he has a phobia about getting married.  Two, he is in the process of being seduced by a college co-ed (Rachel Bilson).To complicate matters, his bride-to-be is carrying his child.  Needless to say, this all makes for a VERY messy situation.  He has several male friends in different stages of relationships, and it seems that the lot of them have some growing up to do as well as Mike. You can even throw Jenna's father into the category of a guy who needs to ""grow up.""  However, Mike's transgressions are the most egregious of any character's in the film.What makes this film work is the emotional performance of Barrett.  If we don't empathize w/her character, then the film is a wash.  She does a good job of portraying a woman who is extremely hurt & vulnerable, w/out crossing over the line & becoming a character who is just-plain-annoying.All in all, this is not a great movie, but it's something of a sentimental one.  It's all about how we need to ""let go"" of the past (as well as our past habits) as we move through different stages in life.  It's about how we need to do thus even when we feel a yearning for our childhood when things were so much simpler.  That, I think, is what this film is all about, even more than the issue of cheating vs. not-cheating on your spouse / fiance' / significant other.",3,Make it last!,1209859200,"05 4, 2008",2008,1497,"['Here', 'heart-wrenching', 'movie', 'love', 'triangle', 'Mike', 'played', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'engaged', 'girlfriend', 'Jenna', 'Jacinda', 'Barrett', 'Unfortunately', '2', 'problems', 'One', 'phobia', 'getting', 'married', 'Two', 'process', 'being', 'seduced', 'college', 'co-ed', 'Rachel', 'Bilson', '.To', 'complicate', 'matters', 'bride-to-be', 'carrying', 'child', 'Needless', 'say', 'VERY', 'messy', 'situation', 'several', 'male', 'friends', 'different', 'stages', 'relationships', 'lot', 'have', 'growing', 'up', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'Mike', 'can', 'even', 'throw', 'Jenna', 'father', 'category', 'guy', 'who', 'grow', 'up', 'However', 'Mike', 'transgressions', 'are', 'most', 'egregious', 'character', 'film.What', 'film', 'work', 'emotional', 'performance', 'Barrett', 'do', ""n't"", 'empathize', 'w/her', 'character', 'then', 'film', 'wash.', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'woman', 'who', 'extremely', 'hurt', 'vulnerable', 'crossing', 'line', 'becoming', 'character', 'who', 'just-plain-annoying.All', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'something', 'sentimental', 'one', 'how', 'need', 'let', 'go', 'past', 'as', 'well', 'past', 'habits', 'move', 'different', 'stages', 'life', 'how', 'need', 'do', 'thus', 'even', 'when', 'feel', 'yearning', 'childhood', 'when', 'things', 'were', 'so', 'much', 'simpler', 'think', 'what', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'issue', 'cheating', 'vs.', 'not-cheating', 'spouse', '/', 'fiance', '/', 'significant', 'other']",N/A

1028435,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000JLTRJA,Ed Uyeshima,"[8, 9]","The creative, idiosyncratic spark that elevated 2004's ""Garden State"" is rather lacking in Zach Braff's latest starring vehicle, a decidedly old-school dramedy with a new-fangled soundtrack. Granted he does not direct nor write his latest. This time, actor Tony Goldwyn directs and Paul Haggis wrote the screenplay, and it has the familiar multi-character, stacked-deck approach that Haggis' script for ""Crash"" has. Unfortunately, this 2006 film also reflects the more pedestrian style Goldwyn exhibited with the 2001 Ashley Judd rom-com, ""Someone Like You"" than his textured work in his more impressive debut, 1999's ""A Walk on the Moon"".The plot revolves around four buddies nearing thirty, all grappling with growing up and moving to the next stage of their lives. The main focal point is Michael, an architect whose longtime girlfriend Jenna's unexpected pregnancy has him questioning his readiness for marital domesticity. The opening dinner scene where they announce their intentions to her parents is a terrific set-piece of nervous ambivalence and guarded enthusiasm. The film then has Michael facing the dilemma of an unsettling attraction to a comely coed Kim, whom he meets at a friend's wedding. Their burgeoning attraction is strictly all by-the-numbers, especially the necessary deceptive elements of it.Meanwhile, the clownish Izzy, unceremoniously dumped by his girlfriend, cannot move on and decides to buy a used RV to travel to Tierra del Fuego. Already married with a baby, Chris regrets his commitments, as he cannot cope with his shrewish wife and constantly crying baby. As the least ready for any kind of commitment, hedonistic Kenny seems to find the ideal woman with similar sensibilities until she wants to introduce him to her parents. As an obvious counterpoint to Michael and Jenna's inevitable crisis, her parents Anna and Stephen face a mid-life crisis which forces Anna to seek solace from a former lover. But it is Michael's deceptive quagmire that takes up most of the film's running time, and the last ten minutes amount to a wonderfully executed sequence (the sandwich drop is a nice touch).Forced by the script to be rather elliptical in character, Braff comes across as more passive and frustrating than likable as Michael, especially as the story moves along. Jacinda Barrett gets to show more colors as Jenna, but the movie never explores how her character's puritanical nature may have contributed to Michael's wandering eye. As Kim, Rachel Bilson does what she can to make her youthful character compelling, but again her character is rather simplified to what our initial impression of her is. Michael Weston (Izzy), Eric Christian Olsen (Kenny) and helium-voiced Casey Affleck (Chris) play the other guys to their accustomed stereotypes, but Haggis's script doesn't allow us more than a cursory look at their dilemmas, especially Chris's where it seems his wife has a pretty solid case for her sour demeanor.Not too surprisingly, Tom Wilkinson and Blythe Danner add much-needed gravitas to the movie, though I have to admit Wilkinson seems to be repeating much of his performance as an impassive husband from Todd Field's ""In the Bedroom"". Danner, however, has been allowed more depth here than most of her big-screen appearances, and she seizes most of her moments, even if her implied affair with Harold Ramis is given short shrift. This movie will likely attract those who think they will be seeing a romantic comedy, but what they will see is a hodgepodge of male maturity issues.",3,Peter Pan-demonium,1158364800,"09 16, 2006",2006,3529,"['creative', 'idiosyncratic', 'spark', 'elevated', '2004', 'Garden', 'State', 'rather', 'lacking', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'latest', 'starring', 'vehicle', 'decidedly', 'old-school', 'dramedy', 'new-fangled', 'soundtrack', 'Granted', 'not', 'direct', 'write', 'latest', 'time', 'actor', 'Tony', 'Goldwyn', 'directs', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'familiar', 'multi-character', 'stacked-deck', 'approach', 'Haggis', 'script', 'Crash', 'Unfortunately', '2006', 'film', 'also', 'more', 'pedestrian', 'style', 'Goldwyn', 'exhibited', '2001', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'rom-com', 'Someone', 'textured', 'work', 'more', 'impressive', 'debut', '1999', 'A', 'Walk', 'Moon', '.The', 'plot', 'four', 'buddies', 'nearing', 'thirty', 'grappling', 'growing', 'up', 'moving', 'next', 'stage', 'lives', 'main', 'focal', 'point', 'Michael', 'architect', 'longtime', 'girlfriend', 'Jenna', 'unexpected', 'pregnancy', 'questioning', 'readiness', 'marital', 'domesticity', 'opening', 'dinner', 'scene', 'where', 'announce', 'intentions', 'parents', 'terrific', 'set-piece', 'nervous', 'ambivalence', 'guarded', 'enthusiasm', 'film', 'then', 'Michael', 'facing', 'dilemma', 'unsettling', 'attraction', 'comely', 'coed', 'Kim', 'whom', 'friend', 'wedding', 'burgeoning', 'attraction', 'strictly', 'by-the-numbers', 'especially', 'necessary', 'deceptive', 'elements', 'it.Meanwhile', 'clownish', 'Izzy', 'unceremoniously', 'dumped', 'girlfriend', 'can', 'not', 'move', 'decides', 'buy', 'used', 'RV', 'travel', 'Tierra', 'del', 'Fuego', 'Already', 'married', 'baby', 'Chris', 'commitments', 'can', 'not', 'cope', 'shrewish', 'wife', 'constantly', 'crying', 'baby', 'least', 'ready', 'kind', 'commitment', 'hedonistic', 'Kenny', 'find', 'ideal', 'woman', 'similar', 'sensibilities', 'introduce', 'parents', 'obvious', 'counterpoint', 'Michael', 'Jenna', 'inevitable', 'crisis', 'parents', 'Anna', 'Stephen', 'face', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'Anna', 'seek', 'solace', 'former', 'lover', 'Michael', 'deceptive', 'quagmire', 'up', 'most', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'amount', 'wonderfully', 'executed', 'sequence', 'sandwich', 'drop', 'nice', 'touch', '.Forced', 'script', 'be', 'rather', 'elliptical', 'character', 'Braff', 'more', 'passive', 'frustrating', 'likable', 'Michael', 'especially', 'story', 'moves', 'along', 'Jacinda', 'Barrett', 'show', 'more', 'colors', 'Jenna', 'movie', 'never', 'how', 'character', 'puritanical', 'nature', 'may', 'have', 'contributed', 'Michael', 'wandering', 'eye', 'Kim', 'Rachel', 'Bilson', 'what', 'can', 'make', 'youthful', 'character', 'compelling', 'again', 'character', 'rather', 'simplified', 'what', 'initial', 'impression', 'Michael', 'Weston', 'Izzy', 'Eric', 'Christian', 'Olsen', 'Kenny', 'helium-voiced', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Chris', 'play', 'other', 'guys', 'accustomed', 'stereotypes', 'Haggis', 'script', ""n't"", 'allow', 'more', 'cursory', 'look', 'dilemmas', 'especially', 'Chris', 'where', 'wife', 'pretty', 'solid', 'case', 'sour', 'demeanor.Not', 'too', 'surprisingly', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'add', 'much-needed', 'gravitas', 'movie', 'have', 'admit', 'Wilkinson', 'be', 'repeating', 'much', 'performance', 'impassive', 'husband', 'Todd', 'Field', 'Bedroom', 'Danner', 'however', 'been', 'allowed', 'more', 'depth', 'here', 'most', 'big-screen', 'appearances', 'most', 'moments', 'even', 'implied', 'affair', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'given', 'short', 'shrift', 'movie', 'will', 'likely', 'attract', 'who', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'what', 'will', 'see', 'hodgepodge', 'male', 'maturity', 'issues']",N/A

They've been putting off marriage, but now he panics because he thinks his life is all set in stone.  How short-sighted and immature is that?  So, he meets this 19-yr-old college girl and starts gravitating toward her, even though his pregnant girlfriend is amazing and hasn't really given him any reason to stray.Meanwhile, his friends are also lost in their relationships.  One, Casey Affleck, is married, with a small baby, and he wants to leave the wife because she's always harping on him about the baby.  We don't get much insight into that situation though.  Meanwhile, another friend obsesses over the end of his relationship to the point of stalking his ex-, and yet another friend avoids serious relationships altogether.

The four hapless almost-30s of this film are so mired in early adolescence it's a wonder they don't have acne: Michael (Zach Broff) feels his life is over because he's about to become a father; Kenny, the bartender, can't endure any relationship more complex than a one-night stand; Chris (Casey Affleck) walks out on his family because his wife is constantly finding fault with him (so, what else is new?); and Izzy (Michael Weston) just can't seem to get over his high school girlfriend. In short, they're putzes.And if the guys are all putzes, the gals are completely meshuggah. Anna (Blythe Danner), whose daughter is pregnant with Michael the Putz's baby, stares into a mirror every night and complains that her husband doesn't gaze at her as if ""he had to have her."" (After 30 years, what's to have?) She drinks too much, is jealous of her daughter, has had an affair with Harold Ramis and is completely off her rocker. (Only a nut would give up Tom Wilkinson.)Kim (Rachel Bilson), is a dippy college student who thinks Michael is a ""great guy"" and wants to sleep with him. So, what's so great about Michael? He lies to his girlfriend, deceives Kim, manipulates his friends, and has no chin. Kim throws underwear at her roommate and probably listens to System of a Down. She's obviously a couple sandwiches short of a picnic.Chris's wife never stops yelling at him, because she's stuck with a screaming baby all day. Chris walks out, she apologizes, Chris comes back, she yells, Chris leaves again and on his way out she hands him the baby and says ""see you Monday."" Nuts, nuts, nuts. (I mean, what sort of woman would hand over her infant to a man who was LEAVING her??? Keep the kid, lady!!!)The only sane character was Izzy (Michael Weston), who bursts into his ex-girlfriend's bedroom, punches out the guy she's in bed with, says he loves her, punches the guy again and then takes off for Tierra del Fuego in an RV. (That's definitely not crazy. I've done it myself.)If you come away from this film with the impression that you've just watched a slice of life, then you are right. People really do follow the advice they read in magazines, they really do say insipid things like ""I'll try harder"" to their mortally wounded spouses, they are irrational, unreasonable and they can't handle the normal responsibilities of adulthood. That much is true, and the actors did a very good job of convincing me of their fallibility. The only problem is that this slice of life featured unsympathetic, two-dimensional characters I didn't enjoy watching and wouldn't want to know (except for the guy with the RV) doing incomprehensible things (except for the guy with the RV), for reasons that were unfathomable (except for ....)",3,Coming of age in America...,1265932800,"02 12, 2010",2010,2759,"['29', 'new', '14', 'four', 'hapless', 'almost-30s', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'mired', 'early', 'adolescence', 'wonder', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'acne', 'Michael', 'Zach', 'Broff', 'life', 'over', 'become', 'father', 'Kenny', 'bartender', 'ca', ""n't"", 'endure', 'relationship', 'more', 'complex', 'one-night', 'stand', 'Chris', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'out', 'family', 'wife', 'constantly', 'finding', 'fault', 'so', 'what', 'else', 'new', 'Izzy', 'Michael', 'Weston', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'high', 'school', 'girlfriend', 'short', ""'re"", 'putzes.And', 'guys', 'are', 'putzes', 'gals', 'are', 'completely', 'meshuggah', 'Anna', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'daughter', 'pregnant', 'Michael', 'Putz', 'baby', 'mirror', 'night', 'husband', ""n't"", 'gaze', 'had', 'have', '30', 'years', 'what', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'jealous', 'daughter', 'had', 'affair', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'completely', 'rocker', 'Only', 'nut', 'would', 'give', 'up', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Kim', 'Rachel', 'Bilson', 'dippy', 'college', 'student', 'who', 'Michael', 'great', 'guy', 'sleep', 'So', 'what', 'so', 'great', 'Michael', 'girlfriend', 'Kim', 'friends', 'chin', 'Kim', 'underwear', 'roommate', 'probably', 'listens', 'System', 'Down', 'obviously', 'couple', 'short', 'picnic.Chris', 'wife', 'never', 'yelling', 'stuck', 'screaming', 'baby', 'day', 'Chris', 'out', 'Chris', 'back', 'Chris', 'again', 'way', 'baby', 'see', 'Monday', 'Nuts', 'nuts', 'nuts', 'mean', 'what', 'sort', 'woman', 'would', 'hand', 'infant', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'LEAVING', 'Keep', 'kid', 'lady', 'only', 'sane', 'character', 'was', 'Izzy', 'Michael', 'Weston', 'who', 'ex-girlfriend', 'bedroom', 'out', 'guy', 'bed', 'guy', 'again', 'then', 'off', 'Tierra', 'del', 'Fuego', 'RV', 'definitely', 'not', 'crazy', ""'ve"", 'done', 'come', 'away', 'film', 'impression', ""'ve"", 'just', 'watched', 'slice', 'life', 'then', 'are', 'right', 'People', 'really', 'do', 'follow', 'advice', 'read', 'magazines', 'really', 'do', 'say', 'insipid', 'things', ""'ll"", 'try', 'harder', 'mortally', 'wounded', 'spouses', 'are', 'irrational', 'unreasonable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'normal', 'responsibilities', 'adulthood', 'much', 'true', 'actors', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'convincing', 'fallibility', 'only', 'problem', 'slice', 'life', 'featured', 'unsympathetic', 'two-dimensional', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'watching', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'guy', 'RV', 'doing', 'incomprehensible', 'things', 'guy', 'RV', 'reasons', 'were', 'unfathomable']",N/A

He finds himself knocking on the big 30 and his charming girlfriend, Jenna (Jacinda Barrett) just got pregnant. He soon finds himself pushing the panic button...is it time to grow up, to finally settle and wake up to one person for the rest of his life? And the mere fact that his best buddies aren't doing too well with the relationship department isn't helping him either.He's good buddy Izzy (Michael Weston) is still not over his ex, and Kenny (Eric Christian Olsen) who bartends and sleeps with every female he comes into contact with...and then there's Chris (Casey Affleck) who is married and has a baby...but finds his marriage drifting apart.Michael finds himself lost in the seemingly confusing world of life and relationship, that is until he bumps into a pretty college student Kim (Rachel Bilson)...tempting him to move on...tempting him to taste life from her lips.

1028441,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000JLTRJA,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","In 2001 there was a cute little Italian film 'L'ultimo bacio' that was a comedy of sorts about infidelity and the approach/avoidance conflict of relationships.  As written by Gabriele Muccino it was a smart, sassy, genuinely entertaining movie.  Now as adapted by Paul Haggis and directed by Tony Goldwyn as THE LAST KISS it becomes a sour, fatiguing, shallow examination of life and 'love' in the year 2006.  The result is a fairly depressing movie, almost devoid of comedy, and a sad commentary on relationships.Michael (Zach Braff) lives with Jenna (Jacinda Barrett), avoiding marriage until an unplanned pregnancy changes their outlook.  They announce their upcoming event to Jenna's parents Anna (Blythe Danner) and Stephen (Tom Wilkinson) who on the surface are delighted: below the surface brews a thirty-year marriage that has been anything but happy.There is a wedding party attended by Michael and Jenna and a cadre of Michael's old school chums: lothario Kenny (Eric Christian Olsen), unhappily married Chris (Casey Affleck), and jilted Izzy (Michael Weston).  At the wedding Michael meets college sophomore Kim (Rachel Bilson) and a seduction begins.  It seems the only happy couple in the story, Michael and Jenna, are threatened and indeed they are as Michael succumbs to Kim's advances and Jenna's discovery of the tryst leaves Michael on the street pondering his future.  And all the rest is subplots of how each of these unhappy people copes with messy lives.There is some fine acting here: it would be difficult to not have good performances with the likes of Blythe Danner, Tom Wilkinson, and even Zach Braff on the set.  But the plodding storyline varies from screaming sessions to passion-for-the-moment sessions and leaves little to admire about any of the characters.  It is a sad summary of contemporary life and for this viewer it misses the boat.

The most sultry and inviting of young beauties happens to chance upon him and then onwards the film has it's own beat. The start of the film is catchy, the boldness of the characters is hardly forgettable, the imperfect cinematography, the impracticality of the situations, the music of the film and the way it's most painful scenes make you laugh out loud all help ensure a pleasant viewing experience.Interestingly, Last Kiss doesn't try to take a stand and get over emphatic about promiscuity and otherwise, but it does actually leave quite an impact on the viewer. I think this is one of those films I'd like to own. 3.5 stars is fine with me and maybe I'm just a big Zach Braff fan.About Zach Braff,now. I like how he tries to distance himself from trouble but slips further into it. But, I must add, I thought Rachel Bilson's character was the standalone winner of the film.

1028444,AL8IDHJPCE00K,B000JLTRJA,H,"[3, 5]","Ok, Zach Braff is one of the most talented actors there is. He is one of the most versatile people there are.The Last Kiss is a story of a couple getting married because of a pregnancy. But, they are deeply in love, and cute together, the all-american couple. All of the decisions made, and their lives before them Braff's character gets nervous and starts a flirtation with a girl. After spending a night with her and kissing her he confesses and breaks the heart of his fiancee. After the fight he goes back and sleeps with her, the girlfriend played by Rachel Bilson.There are other moving parts, as all the characters are multi-dimensional. The movie includes stories within the stories of the things going on with his friends, their story, and love lost and found.Eventually Braff and Barrett fight it out, and by waiting and not giving up Braff is able to get Barrett to break down her barriers. Normally this would just piss me off- infedelity, yet her is forgiven- but it's what I like about the movie. It's different- and the forgiveness is the paramount of the love story. Is love stronger than what our morals and values tell us are right? Many people make the decision everyday to stay together. Interestingly enough- Braff get's amazing advice from Barrets father that helps him keep her. He's been the victim of his own wife's infedelity. It's amazing that the movie is very real. Some couples can get over infedelity- while others having never strayed just come to find they don't love each other, and a child is not enough to keep them together. You can't overcome the people you've grown to be sometimes. A lot of my friends were very disappointed- but I guess I like the movie because it's different.

1028445,A1G1PX4U6RSZEA,B000JLTRJA,Jeremy P,"[2, 5]","I'm very disappointed in Zach Braff for taking on this role, better yet i'm still trying to warm up to Zach Braff and he did a bad job of it in this film.  The first 30 minutes of this film focuses on the trials and tribulations of Michael and his three friends struggling with past relationships and present relationships.  Quite frankly him and his friends are selfish jerks, in particular Chris (Casey Affleck).  Chris is so overwhelmed because he has a demanding wife and a baby.  Big Deal.  That's life moron.  It's called responsibility.  I had no sympathy for him whatsoever.  Then their is Izzy.  Izzy (Michael Weston) is a pyscho-path punk invading his ex girlfriend at any given moment. Get over it dude.  Meanwhile you have Kenny.  The All-American bartender at some cheesy bar in Wisconsin.  Kenny seems happy after meeting a new girl at the wedding.  The scene where Kenny is in the middle of sexing up Danielle he LETS THE PYSCHO-PATH Izzy in his house?  *shakes head*  Later in the movie Danielle makes an effort to have Kenny meet her parents and of course he bails out of that situation and wants to run away with the rest of his loser friends in a RV.  These characters in this movie are very irresponsible, selfish, and rude.  Again, I had no sympathy for any of these characters.Lastly you have Michael (Zach Braff).  Michael is the so-called cream of the crop in relation to his other friends.  Happy marriage, beautiful wife, good job, house, car, healthy relationship with the parents, what more can you ask for. He decides to shatter all of that for a dumb college girl, and the funny part is Kim and Jenna look the same.  The audience were supposed to have an understanding as to why he chose to jump her bones (Rachel Bilson).  I can't quote it directly, but he said something along the lines of how he hates that his life is planned.  Planned?  He impregnated his wife unknowingly and he calls his life planned?  I just couldn't understand this characters conflict with life.  I'm assuming Michael felt happier hanging out at frat parties and sexing up 20 year old college girls.  Michael somehow realizes what a predicament he put himself into and immediately disses Kim just like he does to every other girl and attempts to crawl back into Jenna's life.  She totally shuts him out of her life up until her PARENTS convince her to take this loser back?  I could not believe her parents aside from all the drama they had going on in this moving convincing their daughter to take this jerk back.  Nonetheless Michael sits outside Jenna's house waiting patiently for her to forgive him.  I almost turned it off after seeing this loser sit outside her house in state of panic, sorrow, mercy, and forgiveness.  Of course hollywood films don't want audience members leaving with a feeling of melancholy, anger, guilt, etc.  They want people to leave happy!  The ending didn't surprise me whatsoever with her opening her door to let that scumbag in her house.

I'm Kind Of A ...","[8, 9]","I stay so far away from these types of movies that when I finally get to see one or forced to see one I really enjoy it. Last Kiss really surprised me; I thought that a film with so much drama going on within it would just annoy me. What I did get was some really good acting though Zach Braff seems to always have the same expression on his face to me. It could just be me but anyway on to the synopsis. The last Kiss is very very simple, a bunch of friends are turning thirty. They're all at different points in their lives but they all seem to have woman trouble except Michael. This guy has the perfect relationship and his girlfriend is pregnant which he is happy about. He has no problems right? But then the dingbat goes and makes problems making guys look really bad.His friend is getting married and at this wedding he meets a pretty young college student. This girl sets her eyes on him and goes after him and though he resists at first he becomes intrigued by her and starts up something with her. Besides this Michael friends provide more drama and some pretty good comedy. His friend Izzy is still in love with his ex and does some crazy things because of her. He even starts yelling at her at someone else's wedding, foiling and crying because she won't take him back. His friend Chris has a newborn and is tired of coming home to his wife yelling at him and his child crying. Even Michael's girlfriend's parents are having major trouble, it's just a huge web of messy relationships. All of these guys have their trouble but the main focus is how Michael messes up something good all by himself.The Last Kiss was unbelievable and if you ask me the writing itself was a bit different but very realistic. In real life things really just happen all of a sudden and that's what the movie does. It shows how a guy can have everything one day but then one thing just changes his total outlook about his life. I love the dialogue; Jacinda Barret who plays Jenna (Michaels girlfriend) plays an angry girlfriend very well. She was really good even picking up a knife and threatening to kill Michael. The acting was good no problems there but I hated the ending. I was just expecting something different and surprising; also a lot of things were not disclosed. I would have liked to know what happened to the other characters other than the main characters. Overall Last Kiss was a pretty good movie.

Sure, he's funny in ""Scrubs,"" and I enjoyed him in ""Chicken Little,"" but I've never desired to see him in anything that strays from straight comedy or animation.  After watching ""The Last Kiss,"" I'm still not impressed.  The story revolves around four guys on the verge of thirty who seemingly think that whatever you happen to be doing at that age will be what you do for the rest of your life.  It's too early to have a mid-life crisis, guys.Braff has a pregnant girlfriend (Jacinda Barrett) and is afraid to buy a home and raise a family with her.  In a last ditch attempt to hold on to his youth, he has a little fling with a college cutey played by Rachel Bilson.  He later regrets it and goes into one of the longest wait-outs in cinematic history.  His married pal (Casey Affleck) is on the verge of a breakdown because he's tired of his wife yelling at him and telling him how much he sucks and how his fathering skills are.  Two other friends, one dumped by the love of his life and another who's only interested in one-night stands, are given a lot less screen time and a phoned-in resolution.When you roll it all together, you get a load of wimpy guys who are afraid of responsibility, unsure of themselves, and desperate for sympathy, love, or assurance.

Michael is terrified by the idea of marriage, while Jenna is ready to forge ahead with plans for their future and their family. At a friend's wedding, Michael meets Kim (Rachel Bilson), a local college student who makes no secret of her interest in him. With his doubts about the future of his relationship and his impending fatherhood, Michael sees Kim as a beacon that will let him know whether he's making a mistake by growing up too fast and saying he's ready for a future when he might not be. He goes out with Kim, but when Jenna finds out and things start to fall apart he has to decide if he's willing to be the man he would want to be the father of his child or if he wants to hang on to his childish ideas of freedom and detachment.I really enjoyed The Last Kiss, and as mentioned in the Filmmakers' Perspective, can understand how it is meant as a cautionary tale. The idea of forever is a hard thing to swallow at such a young age, and temptation will always rear its ugly head. The idea that someone can fall from grace, and make a mistake--admittedly a humongous, almost unforgiveable one--that will affect his entire future, but that that mistake is what ultimately lets him know the right path, is something that I think is completely relatable. People do bad things, we all make mistakes, and this movie deals with that idea in a very real and honest way. I like this movie more and more as I think about it and think it deserves a chance. Also, it bears mentioning that the song that plays at the end of the movie, ""Winter"" by Josh Radin, is spectacular and the best part of The Last Kiss soundtrack.",4,"""It's what you do to the people you say you love that counts""",1172275200,"02 24, 2007",2007,1739,"['Michael', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'Jenna', 'Jacinda', 'Barrett', 'have', 'been', 'couple', 'three', 'years', 'when', 'discover', ""'re"", 'pregnant', 'Michael', 'terrified', 'idea', 'marriage', 'Jenna', 'ready', 'forge', 'ahead', 'plans', 'future', 'family', 'friend', 'wedding', 'Michael', 'Kim', 'Rachel', 'Bilson', 'local', 'college', 'student', 'who', 'secret', 'interest', 'doubts', 'future', 'relationship', 'impending', 'fatherhood', 'Michael', 'Kim', 'beacon', 'will', 'let', 'know', 'making', 'mistake', 'growing', 'up', 'too', 'fast', 'saying', 'ready', 'future', 'when', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'out', 'Kim', 'when', 'Jenna', 'out', 'things', 'start', 'fall', 'apart', 'decide', 'willing', 'be', 'man', 'would', 'want', 'be', 'father', 'child', 'hang', 'childish', 'ideas', 'freedom', 'detachment.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Last', 'Kiss', 'as', 'mentioned', 'Filmmakers', 'Perspective', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'meant', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'idea', 'forever', 'hard', 'thing', 'swallow', 'young', 'age', 'temptation', 'will', 'always', 'rear', 'ugly', 'head', 'idea', 'someone', 'can', 'fall', 'grace', 'make', 'mistake', 'admittedly', 'humongous', 'almost', 'unforgiveable', 'one', 'will', 'affect', 'entire', 'future', 'mistake', 'what', 'ultimately', 'know', 'right', 'path', 'something', 'think', 'completely', 'relatable', 'People', 'do', 'bad', 'things', 'make', 'mistakes', 'movie', 'idea', 'very', 'real', 'honest', 'way', 'movie', 'more', 'more', 'think', 'think', 'chance', 'Also', 'mentioning', 'song', 'end', 'movie', 'Winter', 'Josh', 'Radin', 'spectacular', 'best', 'part', 'Last', 'Kiss', 'soundtrack']",N/A

I had just watched him as an actor inThe Last Samurai (Two-Disc Special Edition)and recall his breakout role in ""Ghost.""  As the director, he does a good job of keeping the film's pacing through its final frame.  Paul Haggis wrote the screenplay forCrash (Widescreen Edition)& ""Million Dollar Baby.""  He does a nice job adapting the Italian film's screenplay into English.  In the DVD extras he says that the Italian film's screenplay was so good that he basically translated with only a few story modifications for English.Michael is the lead character, a young 30s guy whose live-in girlfriend is pregnant.  Zach Braff plays the character.  He won an Emmy in 2005 for TV's ""Scrubs"" and is well remembered for the film ""Garden State.""  I thought he did a good job mixing the comic sense with the highly intense personal confusion of the character.His girlfriend Jenna is played by Jacinda Barrett who was in ""Ladder 49"" &The Human Stain.Michael has three buddies, all of whom are going through various stages of issues about their romantic relationships.  Casey Affleck plays Chris whose wife has a small boy named Matty.  However, their married life is one long argument making Chris chronically unhappy.  He decides to leave his marriage, but his attachment to his son is one of the joyful pieces of the film.  Casey Affleck does an excellent job as Chris.  Affleck's career is in high gear right now with a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.""  He has already won awards for that role from the National Board of Review, the National Society of Film Critics & St. Louis Gateway Film Critics.Michael Westson has been inHart's War& ""Dukes of Hazzard.""  The DVD extras tell us that he is a former roommate of Zach Braff.  He does an excellent job as the unstable Izzy who cannot accept that his relationship is over.Eric Christian Olsen who lived in Bettendorf, Iowa plays the third buddy Kenny.  He was in the filmCellular (New Line Platinum Series).  He plays a good looking blond guy who has wild romantic relations but spooks when confronted by commitment.  His walk to the door in his birthday suit and the bear rug romance make an impression.Rachel Bilson who was in TV's ""The OC"" plays the college girl Kim who capitalizes on Michael's cold feet and beds him.Jenna's parents are played by two superlative veteran actors.  In the DVD extras, Tony Goldwyn tells how he pursued Blythe Danner to play Anna.  Danner was nominated for Best Supporting Actress by the Satellite Awards for the role and has won an Emmy for TV's ""Huff.""  She is marvelous as she breaks up with her husband after failing to get him to not take her for granted.  Tom Wilkinson who was nominated for Best Actor forIn the Bedroomand is currently nominated for Best Supporting Actor for ""Michael Clayton"" plays her husband Stephen.  Stephen is a counselor, but is apparently too busy to pay much attention to his wife after 30 years of marriage.  It is a powerful scene when Anna picks up a glass and breaks it against the wall over their bed, tremendous with symbolism.I thought this was a good picture, but not an easy one.  All of the characters seem very real, having second thoughts or difficulties in their relationships.

Ostgard ""ostgard""","[1, 1]","I am not going to write a review of this movie...I will just say their is a point in this movie when Zack Braff's character is let off the hook by his fiance' for  what he did when she caught him lying about where he spent his night...he only kissed a girl...at the time she caught him, he admitted everything...lying...the kiss...etc...and at the time he was being honest.  Prior to her forgiveness (the night she caught him) a huge fight happens and Braff left in a huff returning to the other woman and they got it on.  She oblivious to the later encounter forgives him for the initial stuff he told her because thats all she knew about...and it seems all is well, she clearly give him a pass for what she knows.  She is back to herself...she asks him if when he told her what happened he was being honest...and truth be told he was...at the time..because at the time thats all that happened...so he clearly is in the clear and scott-free...there is a pause...as I watched this I gasped thinking...""don't do it""...he then tells her the rest and she flips out on him, kicking him out and he ends up sleeping on the porch.  I laugh at movies, I get pissed when movies insult me like I don't have a brain, but rarely has a movie every caught me up like that for that one monent you really felt like you were in that situation shaken your head like you are about to witness a car wreck.  Thats powerful, thats a great scene.  The movie is real life, and not real life like a Kevin Smith movie were its not really like that...in Smith's movies fat losers win over girls that would never give them the time of day and people talk too much about stuff that they normally would never care about, not as much dialouge as a Quinton movie thats just insane.  This is of course right before Smith rushes an ending to the movie that seems like he put no thought into it and the payoff he build for you never arrives.

1028454,ABF9TML1GLCJ6,B000JLTRJA,Luca,"[30, 32]","This is a dramatic piece originally written and directed by Gabriele Muccino under the title ""The Last Kiss"" (2001). A blockbuster in Italy and a much more intense and revealing experience than this Hollywood counterpart by Tony Goldwyn, who seems to have a penchant for appropriating scripts (million dollar baby and Crash) and legitimizing the depth that is therein displayed. Needless to say in this adaptation - however direct transliteral carbon-copy may be a more accurate description - something is lost. The cultural translation works only within a limited dress, disguising inability to commit with what may be ""existential angst"" in full swing. The Italian version adds intensity where the DreamWorks production carries a blunt tenderness, neither convincing nor endearing, but always aptly dramatized. The casting is excellent as we've come to expect of all of Tricia Wood's engagements, with Zach Braff and Jacinta Barrett and Rachel Bilson in leading roles supported with a surplus of talent in minor agents of definite weight.This movie is well-constructed and racy in an intellectual and sensual sense. What happened to the screams into the void, the cries for more and the desperation for meaning that afflicted the characters in ""L'Ultimo Bacio"" and seems to be an afterthought in a redrafted tale about the fragility of the psyche and the crass expectations we feel obliged to meet and rejoice within.Something is lost in the translation, but the undercurrents are aflowing with enough force to warrant watching and perhaps even comparing. If you are verging on 30 and thinking about getting married you'll end up getting stuck in a nostalgic disoriented displaced mood. If you are a woman you'll wonder why the male presence overarches the female roles, with the answer being a cultural one. In Italy this is a ""Guy-flick"". In other words: a night out with the guys so as to vent, let go and recharge, similar to the much maligned chick-flick category, but more of a phenomena with depth of extra human proportions. Not possible in the US (I apologize for the generalizing vein I force here).To make it simple for the simple ""if you liked Garden State you'll love The Last Kiss.""

This will most definitely not be to everyone's taste.. it is not the rom-com the advertising would have you believe.  It is a study of relationships.Zach Braff plays the 30 year old in a relationship with a woman he adores (Jacinda Barrett).  She has just become pregnant.  This faces him with the realisation that life has no surprises left and he is thrown into angst.  At this point, a young beautiful and sexual woman (Rachel Bilson - a revelation) comes into his life, tempting him to take the easy route away from growing up.  Alongside this we have his friends, in different stages of relationships all facing tough choices - one, Casey Affleck, has a hen-pecking wife with young child, and he is trying to decide whether to stay or not.  Another is a serial womaniser facing reality that it might be time to change his ways, and another is recovering from a painful break up.Crucially, the performances are all absolutely perfect - Zach Braff proves he can do something a little deeper, and Jacinda Barrett is absolutely brilliant.  Every scene has a feeling of truth - you never feel like you are catching them playing at acting.  Also giving the perspective from the other end of a marriage are Tom Wilkinson and Blythe Danner, who after 30 years together are having their own issues.All the stories reflect the mistakes and false starts life brings into relationships, and how they can force us into a more mature place on the other side of those mistakes.It's a talking heads movie, which does not look for any neat solution and traditional boy gets girl scenarios.. but it is a heartfelt look at real life relationships, and anyone over 30 should be able to find at least one of the characters they can relate to.Highly recommended for those that like a talking head intelligent relationship movie that stays as far away from schmalz as possible.",5,A minor masterpiece of character study,1191456000,"10 4, 2007",2007,2072,"['Paul', 'Haggis', 'screenwriter', 'best', 'known', 'now', 'Crash', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'other', 'high', 'profile', 'movies', 'amongst', 'came', 'adaptation', 'Italian', 'film', 'what', 'gem', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'will', 'most', 'definitely', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'taste..', 'not', 'rom-com', 'advertising', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'study', 'relationships.Zach', 'Braff', '30', 'year', 'old', 'relationship', 'woman', 'Jacinda', 'Barrett', 'just', 'become', 'pregnant', 'realisation', 'life', 'surprises', 'left', 'thrown', 'angst', 'point', 'young', 'beautiful', 'sexual', 'woman', 'Rachel', 'Bilson', 'revelation', 'life', 'tempting', 'take', 'easy', 'route', 'away', 'growing', 'up', 'have', 'friends', 'different', 'stages', 'relationships', 'facing', 'tough', 'choices', 'one', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'hen-pecking', 'wife', 'young', 'child', 'trying', 'decide', 'stay', 'not', 'serial', 'womaniser', 'facing', 'reality', 'might', 'be', 'time', 'change', 'ways', 'recovering', 'painful', 'break', 'up.Crucially', 'performances', 'are', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'can', 'do', 'something', 'little', 'deeper', 'Jacinda', 'Barrett', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'scene', 'feeling', 'truth', 'never', 'feel', 'are', 'catching', 'playing', 'acting', 'Also', 'giving', 'perspective', 'other', 'end', 'marriage', 'are', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'who', '30', 'years', 'together', 'are', 'having', 'own', 'issues.All', 'stories', 'reflect', 'mistakes', 'false', 'starts', 'life', 'relationships', 'how', 'can', 'force', 'more', 'mature', 'place', 'other', 'side', 'mistakes.It', 'talking', 'heads', 'movie', 'not', 'look', 'neat', 'solution', 'traditional', 'boy', 'girl', 'scenarios..', 'heartfelt', 'look', 'real', 'life', 'relationships', 'anyone', '30', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'least', 'one', 'characters', 'can', 'relate', 'to.Highly', 'recommended', 'like', 'talking', 'head', 'intelligent', 'relationship', 'movie', 'far', 'away', 'schmalz', 'possible']",N/A

Complication #1 - Jenna is pregnant. Michael and Jenna have decided this is a good thing, and they are going to keep the baby and raise her (it's a girl) together. Complication #2 - the couple goes to a wedding, where Michael meets Kim (Rachel Bilson), who for no apparent reason, throws herself shamelessly at him. Kim is about 20 and still in college. Michael is almost 30 and has a baby on the way (a fact he conveniently forgets to tell Kim). Of course, MAJOR complications ensue.Here's what I think - performances were great. Soundtrack is even better (which I am coming to expect from Braff's films). On the film's Web site, the cast/crew talk about how Garden State (which I loved) was about being confused in your 20s, and how this movie is the next step - being confused in your 30s. My problem with this? I tend to run out of patience with folks who are still confused in their 30s. I mean, GROW UP already. I think your 20s are about exploration, confusion, et al. But by the time you're turning 30, you ought to be mature enough not to go around wounding the people you love. Geez, take a big boy pill.

1028465,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000JLTRJA,Robert Moore,"[12, 30]","Any film that features Zach Braff and Rachel Bilson in the promo photos would, one might expect, be a romantic comedy.  Both are among my favorite performers on television and I was incredibly excited about seeing the two of them together in a movie.  What I discovered instead was an incredibly depressing, downbeat film about a huge number of frakked up relationships.  There are no jokes, but instead a string of immensely heavy scenes about the vagaries of love.  So, my bad.  Only, not only mine.  Whoever was in charge of casting should receive a reprimand.  I don't want to straightjacket Braff and Bilson, but you can't put ambiguous previews and posters all over the place that don't make it clear that this is not a comedy and have done a decent job in promoting the film.  The trouble is, I'm sure they knew that people who liked Braff and Bilson would prefer a comedy to a serious film.  So, they engaged in a slightly deceptive ad campaign.All of this would have been OK if the movie had actually been very good.  But it wasn't.  It was, in fact, somewhat torturous to watch.  There were a long string of emotionally horrific scenes that made for an incredibly awful movie going experience.What the heck were they thinking?  Zach Braff and Rachel Bilson are two of the most likable, adorable performers on TV.  Instead of trading on that likeability, they do all they can do to make Braff as unsympathetic as possible.  Many of the other characters are treated just as harshly.  Many of Tom Wilkinson and Blythe Danner's scenes are just as painful.  And Casey Affleck, who I always find a tad difficult to take, is even less likable than usual because of the horrid way he treats his wife.  And another character who more or less takes on the character of a stalker of his ex-girlfriend.Again, what were they thinking?  Imagine the pitch for the movie at the studio.  ""We're gonna take Zach Braff, give him a pregnant girlfriend, have him meet a really hot girl played by utterly adorable Rachel Bilson and have him cheat on his girlfriend with her, include several other decaying relationships, and then have him treat Rachel Bilson as horribly as he treated his girlfriend.  Audiences will love it!""  Seriously, they could have paid me a very small amount of money and I could, as script analyst, corrected a huge amount of the crap that went into the making of this film.  Thirty minutes from the end things were so messed up that there was simply no way to end it decently.To be honest, I should probably give this one star.  But even though Zach Braff ends up being a thoroughly unlikable jerk wad, I can't dislike completely a movie with Rachel Bilson in it.  She isn't a pillar of morality, but she is adorable.  So two stars for her.  But I should probably take it away because of the writing and the producers.  Who the heck thought this was a good idea?When my daughter was five she said she wanted to see a ""scary movie.""  So I rented one of the later Godzilla movies.  At the end of it she asked, ""What was the scary part?""  Well, at this end of this one I wondered what part was supposed to justify the nearly two hours of my life I devoted to watching it.  Who cares who ended up with who at the end?

1028470,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000JLTRJA,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[6, 13]","""The Last Kiss"", written by Paul Haggis (""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Crash""), directed by Tony Goldwyn, an actor who now directs, and starring Zach Braff (""Garden State"", TV's ""Scrubs"") is an interesting film. It is also a well observed, well written, well acted and often annoying film. But perhaps this is intentional.Michael (Braff) and Jenna (Jacinda Barrett, last seen in ""Poseidon"") have been together for three years. One night, at dinner with her parents, Anna (Blythe Danner) and Stephen (Tom Wilkinson), they announce they are having a baby. Jenna is overjoyed, but everyone else has mixed emotions. At a wedding the next day, Jenna and Michael meet up with the rest of Michael's friends; Chris (Casey Affleck) is tired of his wife telling him how bad he is as she deals with their whiny baby, Izzy (Michael Weston) is taking the break-up of his relationship badly and doesn't react well when his former girlfriend shows up at the wedding and Kenny (Eric Christian Olsen) is firmly unattached and prefers it that way. During the celebration, each of their respective problems surfaces. Then Michael meets Kim (Rachel Bilson, TV's ""The OC""), a forward young college student. Michael is beginning to feel that his `entire life has the feeling it is all planned out' and Kim provides a welcome distraction. Izzy decides the time is right for a road trip to South America. Can he get any of his friends to join him?""The Last Kiss"" is good on many levels and bad on others.Writer Paul Haggis, who wrote ""Million Dollar Baby"" and co-wrote and directed ""Crash"", has given each of these characters more depth and background than you might expect from your average multiplex entry. As the film is based on an Italian movie, I wonder how much of this is his work and how much was already there. Given his background with ""Crash"", I suspect he added a significant amount. Because we are partially invested in each of the characters, the film frequently revisits them. In the film's best sequence, we revisit each character over the course of one evening, after the wedding, as each deals with their life. Michael and Jenna sit at home talking, then arguing. Izzy forces his way into his ex-girlfriend's apartment as she is having sex with a guy she met at the wedding. He leaves, upset, and ends up at Kenny's. Chris decides to leave his wife, also ending up at Kenny's. Kenny, despite the interruptions, is having fantastic sex with a girl he met at the wedding. Anna walks out on Stephen, fed up with his lack of need for her.Okay, so this level of writing is good because a lot is going on. We are never bored. And the characters are interesting and well observed. But the whole situation is phony and theatrical. How can we believe all of these things would happen to this group of people over the course of one evening?The actors are all pretty good, and handle the writing and direction well, but the same theatricality overshadows their performances.Zach Braff shows great promise as an actor. Able to do broad comedy (as the centerpiece of TV's ""Scrubs""), he displayed a wider range as an actor and director in ""Garden State"", a well-made, memorable film. As Michael, he is a confused young man who finds adulthood looming. In a relationship with a beautiful, caring woman, he is unable to commit to marriage because no one he knows has ever had a happy union. With the news of the baby, he puts on a happy face, but we see the conflicting emotions. Then, when he meets Kim, he sees what he wants in her; freedom, excitement, spontaneity, to be a college kid again. Yet, he resists her overtures, giving in slowly and reluctantly.After Jenna finds out, Michael realizes what he has done and attempts to make things right. Everything he does in this regard seems believable and right.What doesn't quite work is why he would cheat on her in the first place. He feels trapped, so he decides to cheat. Yet, when she finds out and leaves him, which is clearly what he would hope would happen, he suddenly wants her back. ""I realized what I would lose"" or some such blathering is his reason for fighting to win her back. Yet, throughout this contrivance, Haggis gives both very truthful things to say, making it only slightly annoying.Yes, I realize that almost every movie affair ends with this realization, but without it, there would be no story. It's up to you to decide if you need to see yet another telling of this type of tale. All I can say is that this one is told better than most.Jacinda Barrett has had quite a year. First, she boarded an ill-fated cruise ship with her young son (""Poseidon"") and now she has to deal with a cheating boyfriend. Not exactly the same level, but she does a better, more convincing job in this smaller, more intimate film.Casey Affleck is also good as Chris, a young man who married too young and now regrets it. Over the course of the film, his journey is similar to Michael's (they even work at the same architecture firm) and is equally well-observed by the writer. This character's resolution is probably the most believable of all the people in this film, well-done, smart and realistic.Michael Weston's Izzy is the comic relief of the group and the most emotional of the bunch. Because of these two traits, he is also the most theatrical and fares least well. From the moment we first meet him, he is distraught, angry, crazy, drunk or more, never at any point appearing like a real human.Eric Christian Olsen is good as Kenny, the free spirited confirmed bachelor of the group. Meeting a woman at the wedding, he returns home to have mutually exciting sex with her. At one point, their relationship changes and Kenny's reaction to the change seems entirely natural and fitting for his character.Rachel Bilson, in her first screen role, is good as Kim, the forward, young college student. She is clearly interested in Michael from the moment she sets eyes on him at the wedding and repeatedly comes on to him. Throughout, she pursues him, even after she learns he has a girlfriend, and clearly has a schoolgirl crush on him. For a long time, Michael will only flirt with her, but when his relationship with Jenna hits a bump, he goes a little further. He is about the most reluctant adulterer ever to appear in film. When the relationship runs its course, Kim's reactions are entirely right for her character's experience, age and place in the world.Danner and Wilkinson's characters are also good, but they seem out of place. Anna leaves Stephen because he `doesn't need her'. She is sick of the look of complacency in his face. She walks out, confronting him at his office, trying to get some reaction out of him. But Stephen is a psychiatrist and remains calm and stoic. The scene where she bursts into his office, during a session to confront him, has one of the funniest lines of dialogue I have heard in a long time. But their characters are not part of the same generation as the others, and don't seem to fit.The film is annoying for a couple of reasons. First, the previously mentioned theatricality of all of this happening to the same group, at the same time. Then, many of the characters treat others like as*holes. Are we supposed to care for these people, empathize with them when they are treating their partners so badly? No, I actually don't think we are. Even though this is annoying, it works in the film's favor. These behaviors make their characters seem even more realistic. No one is good all the time, so to show these people behaving badly makes them appear more human.Also, I just realized that I described almost every actor as `good'. Yet, when critiquing their performances, one thing is consistent. The dialogue is well-written. So there is a small disconnect between the writing and the direction of the actors. They aren't on the same level, making the film see a little artificial. Goldwyn, the director, is a former actor (he played the villain in ""Ghost"") and can handle the job well. But pairing a writer like Haggis with a director like Goldwyn is similar to an art school student working with Rembrandt and attempting to copy his work.""The Last Kiss"" is an interesting film, not perfect, but then life isn't perfect either.",3,"The Good, The Bad, The Annoying and the Truthful",1159228800,"09 26, 2006",2006,8206,"['Last', 'Kiss', 'written', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'Million',
