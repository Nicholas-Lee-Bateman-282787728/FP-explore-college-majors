Here we have 4 superb restorations of 4 of my favourite Autry's ""Cowboy and the Indians"" 4 stars-great cast. ""The Blazing Sun"" 4 stars, and great cast (Alan Hale Jnr). Hills of Utah 5 stars, just for me, perhaps the best with Elaine Riley and sadly Pat Buttram (did anyone actually think he was funny?), and last, by no means least ""On top of Old Smoky"" with the lovely title song sung twice - 5 stars (even the songs are bearable (by Cass County Boys), and this has the added advantage of Gail Davis and Sheila Ryan (also in Cowboy and the Indians), and Zon Murray and Kenne Duncan. I could go on but you get the picture! 4 good, unpretentious, professional westerns, made with care and love, and at a price anyone can afford, and just to repeat - The quality is superb. Fans you have to get this and others in the release series tho I haven't yet, but if they are like this DVD...",5,Gene/Roy  Roy/Gene?

Two of the movies are quite serious , but very good with strong messages through them.  Best of all, we loved On Top Of Old Smoky. I reccommend this set to all who love Gene Autry movies.  I hope Amazon goes on supplying us with all they can find of these old favourites.

We saw the late 1940s and early 1950s AUTRY features at our neighborhood theater. We would argue endlessly about how it was possible for our hero to be riding a horse into town, wearing his six-gun on his hip while the other folks were driving automobiles and trucks. As little kids we didn't get it. But, as an adult I came to understand that these were ""fantasy"" westerns where ""old"" existed right alongside ""new."" Thank goodness TIMELESS picked up the slack left by IMAGE (who don't seem to want to fill the needs of a niche market) and made the deal to continue releasing the restored/complete Autry features. The films look GORGEOUS. Put aside any reservations about these old matinee programmers. They're a lot of fun. If you buy all the TIMELESS Autry releases you won't have to wait to ""hit-n-miss"" see 'em on ENCORE with the ""Western Channel"" bug popping up every 20 minutes and the expected fiber-optic ""tyling"" that usually happens just as Gene has put down his guitar to slug it out with some miscreant. I don't have to tell ""old-timers"" about these films. You newcomers...give 'em a try. TIMELESS did a marvelous job with these Autry Entertainment/Encore restored gems. Buy 'em and ENJOY. Be a ""kid"" again!
