I can really feel the same way, because this poor excuse of a movie absolutely FAILS. ""Theodore Rex"" is about a talking dinosaur who eats only cookies . . . COOKIES?! Did they have to make it all so kid-friendly?! Well, I guess so, since this film does look like it was targeted for people under the age of 6. Anyway, Theodore pairs up with Whoopie, who stars as a fearless detective, into finding out who's killing innocent dinosaurs here and there.Forget about the plot. Forget about the characters. In fact, forget about this entire movie. There's nothing good going here. Even the music goes to waste.

752933,A8SCX6VUTE05H,B000099T3L,"Nuisance ""the rebel""","[3, 5]","These reviews that claim this movie is so bad its good are going way overboard with that one. This movie does not have the guilty pleasure badness that Leonard Part 6, Battlefield Earth and Gigli had. Those movies were entertaining in their awfulness but this pile of dinosaur dung is so bad its painful. I haven't been in this much pain watching a bad movie since I watched Baby Geniuses and Superbabies. Before I start the review let me tell you the story. Theodore Rex is a $35 million dollar bust The New Line Cinema refused to put in theaters. They cut the losses sending it straight to video making it the most expensive straight-to-video movie in decades. Whoopi caved in to be in this disaster after a huge paycheck.Plot: a millionaire clones dinosaurs so he can launch missiles at the sun which would kill mankind and start another Ice Age. A female cop named Katie Coltrane and an idiotic dinosaur named Theodore Rex reluctantly team up to stop him after the death of a buddy dinosaur.The plot is given to you in the beginning of the movie which robs the movie of all its mystery. Then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is actually quite awful. Whoopi looks agitated and is trying to wing it with her performance but to no avail. Theodore Rex is flat out annoying and his bumbling behavior wears thin after five minutes on screen. Most of the jokes revolve around him threatening to bite people and hitting people with his tail(on accident and on purpose). I thought Burglar was bad but it takes a backseat to Theodore Rex: the worst movie of Whoopi's career.Dont let anybody tell you this monstrosity is bad enough to be enjoyable. I didnt see that when I watched this movie. All I saw was a train wreck that was written by people that must have had some sick admiration for movie Howard The Duck. The humor is on that level and Theodore Rex looks like the inbred cousin of Barney.

752934,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B000099T3L,Robert I. Hedges,"[5, 7]","""Theodore Rex"" is the movie that should have ended Whoopi Goldberg's career: it's abysmal on every level, and was an extremely costly disaster for New Line Cinema. Although the intention was to release the film theatrically, the test screenings revealed such a hostile reception that the decision was made to send the $33 million picture direct to video. It was such a catastrophe that director Jonathan Betuel retired from directing after its release. For her part Whoopi attempted to back out of the deal, but legal entanglements ensued (no pun intended) and she agreed to do the part for a reported $7 million, though it's clear from her onscreen presence that she detested every minute of it. The overriding question I quickly formulated was ""Who on Earth green-lighted this?""The plot kicks off with a complicated prologue explaining how billionaire Elizar Kane (Armin Mueller-Stahl) wants to launch his New Eden missile to start a new ice age, so he can rule the world (of course.) Juliet Landau as Dr. Veronica Shade and the always offbeat Bud Cort as Spinner are the other chief architects of mayhem here. Saving the bizarre alternate reality version of Earth presented here, Katie Coltrane (Goldberg) is a world-weary and decidedly grumpy future cop clad in black leather who is paired up in a dinocide investigation with Theodore Rex (voiced by George Newbern,) an implausibly clumsy (oh the hilarity of the wayward tail) and dimwitted dino-cop. Together they uncover much more than expected, resulting in 92 minutes of pain for viewers. From the very outset the film is disastrous: if the opening action scene doesn't make sense to you, it's not you. There's also a terrible romance between Teddy and Molly Rex (voiced by Carol Kane!) who is a dancer at the Extinct Species Club. I was dumbfounded to see that grumpy police commissioner Lynch was played by the talented tough guy Richard Roundtree. Gasp!The dialogue is ponderous from the outset (imagine a dinosaur imitating James Bond saying ""Rex. T. Rex."" for starters) and talk about Katie being ""speciesist"" (humans are called ""softskins"") which is apparently an attempt to sandwich a bit of contemporary political correctness into the movie as a comedic allegory. (Note: this is wholly unsuccessful, and the film has set back progress in human-dinosaur relations several million years.) Oh did I mention that it's also a morality play as Teddy refuses to carry a weapon because he ""doesn't believe in violence."" No opportunity is wasted to remind viewers of the subtle hilarity of the premise: Teddy takes Katie to a dinner of hydroponic seaweed and krill (yes this tyrannosaurus does not eat meat, but instead is addicted to cookies); Carol Kane sings in her dinosaur persona, Teddy tries out undercover costumes in one of the most repellant sequences ever filmed, they ride around in an official police garbage truck (oh, my ribs!), Teddy plays field hockey with his tail, there's a poor urban kid who has a special place in Katie's heart for some reason, and finally Teddy imitates Elvis (""Thank you very much!"") and even worse, Whoopi speaks with a British accent. This is merely a warm-up for Teddy's terrible impressions. If your head is reeling, let me make it clear that mere words cannot do this movie justice.The murderer is a clone registered to New Eden (well that makes perfect sense because...well, never mind...) and at the funeral of the deceased dinosaur a giant fly plays the bongos. OK, so it turns out it's not a giant fly, it's a dinosaur that looks like a giant fly, but you get the picture. Dialogue worsens as running time elapses: ""Was I hatched yesterday?"", ""I didn't butt trumpet!"", and ""You can't eat our only suspect!"" spring immediately to mind. To save the world Katie and Teddy have to enter ""the ninja grid,"" deal with explosive insects, fly an ultralight helicopter, negotiate with kidnappers, and confront horrifying violence as the movie swerves yet again to suddenly become an anti-gun flick as the eternal battle between ""softskin versus scale"" is played out, resulting in a wholly predictable conclusion that's guaranteed to annoy.That ""Theodore Rex"" features a genuinely talented cast (from Goldberg, Roundtree, and Cort to vocal luminaries like Kane, Rodger Bumpass, and Phil Proctor) is undeniable. That their talents were utterly squandered is also undeniable. The DVD doesn't have many extras, the trailer being chief among them, not that I would have sat through this again to listen to anyone explain to me why this was an underappreciated piece of genius if there had been a commentary track. At the end there's a credit reading ""This Film is Dedicated to Lorenzo Ferrari."" What on Earth did Ferrari ever do to anyone to deserve that?If you thought ""Howard the Duck"" was the worst anthropomorphic animal and human movie ever made, think again. This one is a unique brand of awful that is hard to describe. It would, however, be an excellent gift for someone who believes they can withstand any bad movie. Just make sure you don't make the mistake of offering to watch it with them. Plan to be in another country just to play it safe.",1,"""There's Been A Dinocide!""",1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,5146,"['Theodore', 'Rex', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg',
