As a vocalist myself, I feel I may have watched this documentary a little differently than the average viewer and I will say - SHE'S GOT IT.  'IT' being style, class, presence, timbre, quality, and creativity.  Her comfort level in the realm of jazz allowed her to fully embody what jazz is and provided the backdrop to improv like no other artist has achieved.  She is the greatest.This video documentary is what the fans have been waiting for packed with interviews, performances, and those who she touched over the years sharing their thoughts of the experiences they had.  If you buy the DVD, make sure you buy this version with the book, you will not be sorry!  Clippings from O'Days personal scrapbook add a touch of insight into this artists world from fame to drugs and jail to her beautiful outlook on life and enchanting spirit.My only dislike about this product is during the DVD a few interviews take place but it does not state who the person is or the significance of the person in Anita's life.  This does, however, only happen on a few occassions but leaves the viewer guessing.  If you have NO IDEA who Anita O'Day is and you can't see yourself spending this much money for the DVD with book, then you can purchase the DVD by itself or I would suggest ""Jazz On A Summer's Day"" which captures an amazing performance of ""Tea for Two"" and ""Sweet Georgia Brown"" from Anita O'Day.

1244217,A2VJ80PM1G00QV,B001W3P4ZU,drkhimxz,"[0, 0]","Anita O'Day was quite a singer. Anita O'Day apparently suffered the travails of not a few in the rough life of a touring entertainer. This documentary provides a sufficiency of evidence of her singing being worth listening to even today; it provides a good deal of fluff and a modest amount of substance, suggesting, perhaps, that one should read her book to find out something more about the life only hinted at here. It is good to see the singer in action at several stages of her life, although as labeled by the documentary, one short spot might have to stand in for thirty years of performance. I imagine this is due to the fact that she never became a star soloist and, therefore, had few television appearances to provide a rich archive from which to choose. By the age of the musical video she was a has-been save in limited circles ( the customary fate of the average band singer turned soloist as he or she aged). At any rate, she was, happily still alive when the documentary was made, providing a good image of the born entertainer who tries hard to go on to the end with what little may be left. She died shortly after the release of this disc (October 18, 1919 - November 23, 2006).Since this is all we are likely to have available as a visual biography, it is worth seeing for any fan of hers or of pre-Rock swing and jazz. Happily, there seem still to be available, on disc, some other visuals of her performances, to one of which I am about to turn. (By the way, for many of us, the film shots of Anita and Roy Eldridge in vocal interchange, with him following with a brief trumpet solo and Gene Krupa sort of doodling on the drums, may be a nostalgic fling almost worth the price of admission to the whole disc.)",4,"Not a ""Life"", Not A Concert",1302998400,"04 17, 2011",2011,1730,"['Anita', ""O'Day"", 'was', 'quite', 'singer', 'Anita', ""O'Day"", 'apparently', 'suffered', 'travails', 'not', 'few', 'rough', 'life', 'touring', 'entertainer', 'documentary', 'sufficiency', 'evidence', 'singing', 'being', 'worth', 'listening', 'even', 'today', 'good', 'deal', 'fluff', 'modest', 'amount', 'substance', 'suggesting', 'perhaps', 'one', 'should', 'read', 'book', 'find', 'out', 'something', 'more', 'life', 'only', 'hinted', 'here', 'good', 'see', 'singer', 'action', 'several', 'stages', 'life', 'labeled', 'documentary', 'one', 'short', 'spot', 'might', 'have', 'stand', 'thirty', 'years', 'performance', 'imagine', 'due', 'fact', 'never', 'became', 'star', 'soloist', 'therefore', 'had', 'few', 'television', 'appearances', 'provide', 'rich', 'archive', 'choose', 'age', 'musical', 'video', 'was', 'has-been', 'save', 'limited', 'circles', 'customary', 'fate', 'average', 'band', 'singer', 'turned', 'soloist', 'aged', 'rate', 'was', 'happily', 'still', 'alive', 'when', 'documentary', 'was', 'made', 'providing', 'good', 'image', 'born', 'entertainer', 'who', 'hard', 'go', 'end', 'what', 'little', 'may', 'be', 'left', 'died', 'shortly', 'release', 'disc', 'October', '18', '1919', 'November', '23', '2006', '.Since', 'are', 'likely', 'have', 'available', 'visual', 'biography', 'worth', 'seeing', 'fan', 'hers', 'pre-Rock', 'swing', 'jazz', 'Happily', 'seem', 'still', 'be', 'available', 'disc', 'other', 'visuals', 'performances', 'one', 'am', 'turn', 'way', 'many', 'film', 'shots', 'Anita', 'Roy', 'Eldridge', 'vocal', 'interchange', 'following', 'brief', 'trumpet', 'solo', 'Gene', 'Krupa', 'sort', 'doodling', 'drums', 'may', 'be', 'nostalgic', 'fling', 'almost', 'price', 'admission', 'whole', 'disc']",N/A
1244218,A2FJCITRT7GQ0N,B001W3P4ZU,D.R.L.,"[1, 1]","~ This 2-disc set has everything I look for in a documentary.  It is informative, honest, and entertaining.~ The directors / producers Robbie Cavolina and Ian McCrudden have interviewed not only Anita O'Day, but they have also interviewed numerous people who have known her throughout her career.  The combination of interviews gives a complete picture of Anita O'Day.  Thankfully Cavolina & McCrudden decided to make this documentary while Anita was still alive.  Their extensive interviews with Anita reveal an honest, open person who has lived through considerable tragedy and survived with a strength of character and attitude that is inspirational.~ So many documentaries seem to have a mission: either to deify the subject or to vilify the subject.  To achieve the desired goal, those documentaries downplay certain facts and over emphasize others.  However, in this documentary nothing is sugar-coated and nothing is hidden. Anita, Cavolina & McCrudden lay it all out for the viewer, and in the end you may not agree with the way Anita lived her life but you have to respect her honesty and her indestructible spirit.  She never lived in the past, she rolled with the punches, picked herself up, dusted herself off, and moved forward.~ Cavolina & McCrudden have done a nice job of presenting a chronology without making the documentary a simple history lesson.  They do this by interspersing interviews and performance videos.~ The first DVD contains the documentary.  The second DVD contains interview out-takes and more complete performance videos.  All of this is worth viewing and I am glad they included the second DVD.  Some of the performances are from Anita's exceptional performance inJazz on a Summer's Dayand the entertaining videosJazz Icons: Anita O'Day Live in '63 & '70andLive in Tokyo '63.~ The DVDs are packaged with a 30 page booklet that is a welcome addition and worth reading.~ This documentary serves as an excellent companion to Anita's autobiographyHigh Times Hard Times~ Highly recommended for anyone interested in learning more about one of the jazz greats.",5,"Informative, Honest, and Entertaining",1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,2090,"['~', '2-disc', 'set', 'everything', 'look', 'documentary', 'informative', 'honest', 'entertaining.~', 'directors', '/', 'producers', 'Robbie', 'Cavolina', 'Ian', 'McCrudden', 'have', 'interviewed', 'not', 'only', 'Anita', ""O'Day"", 'have', 'also', 'interviewed', 'numerous', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'known', 'career', 'combination', 'interviews', 'complete', 'picture', 'Anita', ""O'Day"", 'Thankfully', 'Cavolina', 'McCrudden', 'decided', 'make', 'documentary', 'Anita', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'extensive', 'interviews', 'Anita', 'reveal', 'honest', 'open', 'person', 'who', 'lived', 'considerable', 'tragedy', 'survived', 'strength', 'character', 'attitude', 'inspirational.~', 'So', 'many', 'documentaries', 'seem', 'have', 'mission', 'deify', 'subject', 'vilify', 'subject', 'achieve', 'desired', 'goal', 'documentaries', 'downplay', 'certain', 'facts', 'emphasize', 'others', 'However', 'documentary', 'nothing', 'sugar-coated', 'nothing', 'hidden', 'Anita', 'Cavolina', 'McCrudden', 'lay', 'out', 'viewer', 'end', 'may', 'not', 'agree', 'way', 'Anita', 'lived', 'life', 'have', 'respect', 'honesty', 'indestructible', 'spirit', 'never', 'lived', 'past', 'rolled', 'punches', 'picked', 'up', 'dusted', 'off', 'moved', 'forward.~', 'Cavolina', 'McCrudden', 'have', 'done', 'nice', 'job', 'presenting', 'chronology', 'making', 'documentary', 'simple', 'history', 'lesson', 'do', 'interspersing', 'interviews', 'performance', 'videos.~', 'first', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'second', 'DVD', 'interview', 'out-takes', 'more', 'complete', 'performance', 'videos', 'worth', 'viewing', 'am', 'glad', 'included', 'second', 'DVD', 'performances', 'are', 'Anita', 'exceptional', 'performance', 'inJazz', 'Summer', 'Dayand', 'entertaining', 'videosJazz', 'Icons', 'Anita', ""O'Day"", 'Live', ""'63"", ""'70andLive"", 'Tokyo', 'DVDs', 'are', 'packaged', '30', 'page', 'booklet', 'welcome', 'addition', 'worth', 'reading.~', 'documentary', 'serves', 'excellent', 'companion', 'Anita', 'autobiographyHigh', 'Times', 'Hard', 'Times~', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'interested', 'learning', 'more', 'one', 'jazz', 'greats']",N/A
1244219,AH1M9A3JTV7C3,B001W3P4ZU,Ian Muldoon,"[55, 56]","Ms O'Day preferred the title ""stylist"" as opposed to ""singer"" which I find an interesting distinction. I gather she made the distinction in acknowledgement that she had little vocal range, an ordinary tone, and a strange timbre.My first significant encounter with her music was post Gene Krupa with the release in 1956 of ANITA by Norman Granz and the best version of HONEYSUCKLE ROSE with its solo bass opening and quartet of trombones closing the final chorus. The whole album though, was and remains, one of her best, and one of the best of any JAZZ singer. And that's where her reputation so superbly lies - as one of the very best JAZZ vocalists ever, and an individual woman who was a great survivor in a very difficult business - that she was embraced by the jazz community including afro american musicians, she got through the heroin journey, she overcame the ""canary"" prejudice of ""girl"" singer by her musical brilliance in being accepted rather as another musical INSTRUMENT instead of the ""front"" for a band.This documentary - one of the best (musical ones) I've seen which was featured in the 2008 Sydney Film Festival - also reveals her character. Moral strength, modesty, honesty, understanding and self awareness and I guess, joy of music, of living, are her distinguishing characteristics.PLenty of good music in the film as well!!",5,No stylist quite like Ms O'Day,1248307200,"07 23, 2009",2009,1348,"['Ms', ""O'Day"", 'preferred', 'title', 'stylist', 'opposed', 'singer', 'find', 'interesting', 'distinction', 'gather', 'made', 'distinction', 'acknowledgement', 'had', 'little', 'vocal', 'range', 'ordinary', 'tone', 'strange', 'timbre.My', 'first', 'significant', 'encounter', 'music', 'was', 'post', 'Gene', 'Krupa', 'release', '1956', 'ANITA', 'Norman', 'Granz', 'best', 'version', 'HONEYSUCKLE', 'ROSE', 'solo', 'bass', 'opening', 'quartet', 'trombones', 'closing', 'final', 'chorus', 'whole', 'album', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'one', 'best', 'JAZZ', 'singer', 'where', 'reputation', 'so', 'superbly', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'JAZZ', 'vocalists', 'ever', 'individual', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'great', 'survivor', 'very', 'difficult', 'business', 'was', 'embraced', 'jazz', 'community', 'including', 'afro', 'american', 'musicians', 'got', 'heroin', 'journey', 'overcame', 'canary', 'prejudice', 'girl', 'singer', 'musical', 'brilliance', 'being', 'accepted', 'rather', 'musical', 'INSTRUMENT', 'instead', 'front', 'band.This', 'documentary', 'one', 'best', 'musical', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'was', 'featured', '2008', 'Sydney', 'Film', 'Festival', 'also', 'character', 'Moral', 'strength', 'modesty', 'honesty', 'understanding', 'self', 'awareness', 'guess', 'joy', 'music', 'living', 'are', 'distinguishing', 'characteristics.PLenty', 'good', 'music', 'film', 'as', 'well']",N/A

1244221,A28GCEHD00JFZG,B001W3P4ZU,Julian Kennedy,"[10, 13]","Anita O'Day: The Life of a Jazz Singer: 6 out of 10: I had no idea who Anita O'Day was when I rented this film. I like Jazz well enough and enjoy having it as background music, but I am hardly what one describes as an aficionado.Since viewing this film, I have watched the wonderful documentary 'Jazz on a Summer's Day' and have downloaded some fine Anita O'Day jazz albums.Therefore, from one point of view, the documentary is a stunning success. It got me interested enough in its subject, for me to take actions after viewing.The film however suffers from uneven interviews and presentation. Film quality is all over the map and some of O'Day's last interviews were clearly filmed by folks unfamiliar with the workings of a motion picture camera.Even more disappointing is the poor sound quality of many of the musical tracks and the lack of sampling from her albums.You know if you have a 16-year heroin addiction and four failed marriages and you still manage to live until 87 despite grinding poverty and botched healthcare, you are the definition one tough bird. Unfortunately that also signifies most of your contemporaries are long dead. Many of the war stories as a result, tend to be second hand at best.The film does contain one wonderful non-musical highlight. In a mid-seventies interview a young Bryant Gumbel states to O'Day 'Your life story involves rape, failed relationships, drugs, and multiple abortions"". O'Day's that is just they way it went down response is priceless.Anita O'Day: The Life of a Jazz Singer is a decent film but I would recommend renting Jazz on a Summer's Day first.

This biographical treatment is remarkable because of how frank Anita is when she relates parts of her story in her own words. She starts, literally, at the beginning (I guess being conceived out of wedlock was an auspicious beginning to the interesting and sometimes difficult life that followed.)The movie details her life in broad strokes, if for no other reason than she managed to cram a lot of living and accomplishments in her 87 years. And it comes across as slick in some places, which is a marked contrast to her autobiography,High Times Hard Times, which is even more open and a lot more graphic. Indeed, by combining this video with that book you will gain a far more complete understanding of who Anita was and how she became who she was than by only watching this video or reading the book.What makes the story so remarkable is how she managed to live the jazz life and survive for so long. When she did make her inevitable fall, winding up in a trailer broke and seemingly forgotten, she managed to make yet another comeback. And don't attribute that to the ""luck of the Irish"" because, as she explains in the video, she was born Anita Belle Colton and took the pig Latin form of ""dough"" - slang for money - to invent her new name.One part of the story she told in this video that I found particularly fascinating is how she and John Poole, her drummer of four decades, hooked up. Poole is one of my idols and inspirations, so that story meant a lot to me.  In fact, Anita's first husband, Don Carter, was a drummer who gave her drum lessons. That may explain her outstanding sense of rhythm and timing, and also in her phrasing when she is singing.Overall, this is a fascinating video of a strong woman who lived life on her own terms. It is also the story of a highly successful musician who managed to maintain a 72-year long career. Either aspect makes this video worthwhile, but there is another slice that you have to closely watch her performances to see: how she could dominate a stage and control an ensemble - large or small. Part was her charisma, part her personal strength, and part, I am certain, is the respect she earned from her peers sharing her stage.If you love her music and are inspired to know more about her, this is a good place to start.",5,Amazing story told honestly and openly,1335657600,"04 29, 2012",2012,2413,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'tagged', 'Anita', 'Jezebel', 'Jazz', 'Drummer', 'Vocalist', 'rank', 'neat', 'top', 'personal', 'short', 'list', 'vocalists', 'biographical', 'treatment', 'remarkable', 'how', 'frank', 'Anita', 'when', 'parts', 'story', 'own', 'words', 'literally', 'beginning', 'guess', 'being', 'conceived', 'wedlock', 'was', 'auspicious', 'beginning', 'interesting', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'life', 'followed', 'movie', 'details', 'life', 'broad', 'strokes', 'other', 'reason', 'managed', 'cram', 'lot', 'living', 'accomplishments', '87', 'years', 'slick', 'places', 'marked', 'contrast', 'autobiography', 'High', 'Times', 'Hard', 'Times', 'even', 'more', 'open', 'lot', 'more', 'graphic', 'Indeed', 'combining', 'video', 'book', 'will', 'gain', 'far', 'more', 'complete', 'understanding', 'who', 'Anita', 'was', 'how', 'became', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'watching', 'video', 'reading', 'story', 'so', 'remarkable', 'how', 'managed', 'live', 'jazz', 'life', 'survive', 'so', 'long', 'When', 'did', 'make', 'inevitable', 'fall', 'winding', 'up', 'trailer', 'broke', 'seemingly', 'forgotten', 'managed', 'make', 'yet', 'comeback', 'do', ""n't"", 'attribute', 'luck', 'Irish', 'because', 'video', 'was', 'born', 'Anita', 'Belle', 'Colton', 'took', 'pig', 'Latin', 'form', 'dough', 'slang', 'money', 'invent', 'new', 'name.One', 'part', 'story', 'told', 'video', 'found', 'particularly', 'fascinating', 'how', 'John', 'Poole', 'drummer', 'four', 'decades', 'hooked', 'up', 'Poole', 'one', 'idols', 'inspirations', 'story', 'meant', 'lot', 'fact', 'Anita', 'first', 'husband', 'Don', 'Carter', 'was', 'drummer', 'who', 'gave', 'drum', 'lessons', 'may', 'explain', 'outstanding', 'sense', 'rhythm', 'timing', 'also', 'phrasing', 'when', 'singing.Overall', 'fascinating', 'video', 'strong', 'woman', 'who', 'lived', 'life', 'own', 'terms', 'also', 'story', 'highly', 'successful', 'musician', 'who', 'managed', 'maintain', '72-year', 'long', 'career', 'aspect', 'video', 'worthwhile', 'slice', 'have', 'closely', 'watch', 'performances', 'see', 'how', 'could', 'dominate', 'stage', 'control', 'ensemble', 'large', 'small', 'Part', 'was', 'charisma', 'part', 'personal', 'strength', 'part', 'am', 'certain', 'respect', 'earned', 'peers', 'sharing', 'stage.If', 'love', 'music', 'are', 'inspired', 'know', 'more', 'good', 'place', 'start']",N/A

It was mesmerizing and I couldn't wait to get hold of a DVD copy. Then came word they were having trouble getting music clearances and that the DVD might not ever be released. Thankfully they ironed out the details and this sorely needed gem of documentary is a shot to the gut. Because of her bad girl image, earned, she never got the mainstream focus. But this documentary drags her from the realm of those in the know and into the pantheon of great jazz singers. In her own way, she was the best.

That's what great documentarys do.",5,"Bad Girl; such a Bad, Good Girl",1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,770,"['was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'be', 'preview', 'documentary', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Playboy', 'Jazz', 'Film', 'was', 'mesmerizing', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'hold', 'DVD', 'copy', 'Then', 'came', 'word', 'were', 'having', 'trouble', 'getting', 'music', 'clearances', 'DVD', 'might', 'not', 'ever', 'be', 'released', 'Thankfully', 'ironed', 'out', 'details', 'sorely', 'needed', 'gem', 'documentary', 'shot', 'gut', 'bad', 'girl', 'image', 'earned', 'never', 'got', 'mainstream', 'focus', 'documentary', 'realm', 'know', 'pantheon', 'great', 'jazz', 'singers', 'own', 'way', 'was', 'best', 'created', 'style', 'others', 'followed', 'June', 'Christy', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'life', 'find', 'more', 'work', 'what', 'great', 'documentarys', 'do']",N/A

Consisting of interviews, reminiscences by friends and colleagues, appreciations by jazz historians and scholars, and lots and lots of vintage clips of her performances, this film paints a fascinating portrait of a singer who was, above all, a survivor.  O'Day candidly discusses her tumultuous life, especially her 16-year addiction to heroin.There are some technical glitches in the film--slightly out of focus photography in spots, muddy sound in others--but it is worthwhile and enjoyable nonetheless.",4,Portrait of a survivor,1318464000,"10 13, 2011",2011,700,"['Interesting', 'documentary', 'jazz', 'icon', 'Anita', ""O'Day"", 'tracing', 'life', 'career', 'days', 'big', 'band', 'singer', 'Gene', 'Krupa', 'glory', 'days', '1950', 'down', 'present', 'Consisting', 'interviews', 'reminiscences', 'friends', 'colleagues', 'appreciations', 'jazz', 'historians', 'scholars', 'lots', 'lots', 'vintage', 'clips', 'performances', 'film', 'fascinating', 'portrait', 'singer', 'who', 'was', 'survivor', ""O'Day"", 'candidly', 'tumultuous', 'life', 'especially', '16-year', 'addiction', 'are', 'technical', 'glitches', 'film', 'slightly', 'focus', 'photography', 'spots', 'muddy', 'sound', 'others', 'worthwhile', 'enjoyable', 'nonetheless']",N/A
