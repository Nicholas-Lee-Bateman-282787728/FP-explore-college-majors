These films were obviously a labor of love for Sylvia and Gerry Anderson, and their extra efforts show in every frame.  Derek Meddings' designs are just incredible; it's easy to see how he was hired to do the futuristic model effects for the James Bond movies.  And the dream sequence in ""Thunderbirds Are Go!"", in which Cliff (""Devil Woman"", ""Little in Love"") Richard and the seminal group The Shadows are modeled by perfect marionette replicas (in what could quite possibly be the first MTV-type music video ever) is alone, in my opinion, worth the price of both DVDs.The only quibble I would have with both movies would be in the pacing.  There are quite a few slow points in these films (e.g., the launches of the Thunderbirds, the rollout of the Mars vehicle in ""Thunderbirds Are Go!"" which goes on for a full 10 minutes!).  The finely detailed work in the sets and the marionettes well deserve this extra ogling time, though, and I believe kids will particularly be impressed by the ""hardware"" displayed and won't mind the plodding of these scenes.The extras are fun, too.

822004,A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE,B00022PZ56,G. Max Gooding,"[0, 0]","I purchased this set of DVDs because as a boy I remembered seeing these films on the big screen. Back then I was totally blown away by the imagination of Gerry Anderson and his team. What makes these movies so marvelous is that even over 40 years later, they can still hold their own for storyline, gadgets, originality and excitement.The musical score is exceptional and adds to the majesty of the equipment being portrayed. When the Zero-X in 'Thunderbirds are Go' rolls out the complete screenplay is nothing short of amazing. Because of the difficulty in getting the puppets to walk, there are all of these amazing lifts and conveyors to get the pilots to their cockpits, again this is quite fascinating.What I find to be wonderful additions to these titles are the special featurettes that show and explain how the puppets were designed, made and operated. The producers also developed this art to perfection on their own as well. The ingenuity used to get the puppets to talk is also nothing short of fascinating.What is to be noted is that when theses films were made there was not all the interjection of computer animation like the films of today, yet these movies can still hold their own. This is by no means a small feat.The current price is a real bargain. You can't go wrong with this one. As an additional bonus included are nicely printed card board punch outs of a the thunderbirds, as well as punch out fridge magnets of the main puppet characters.",5,A Blast from the Past: Truly Visionary Family Action Movies,1285718400,"09 29, 2010",2010,1466,"['purchased', 'set', 'DVDs', 'boy', 'remembered', 'seeing', 'films', 'big', 'screen', 'Back', 'then', 'was', 'totally', 'blown', 'away', 'imagination', 'Gerry', 'Anderson', 'team', 'What', 'movies', 'so', 'marvelous', 'even', '40', 'years', 'later', 'can', 'still', 'hold', 'own', 'storyline', 'gadgets', 'originality', 'excitement.The', 'musical', 'score', 'exceptional', 'majesty', 'equipment', 'being', 'portrayed', 'When', 'Zero-X', ""'Thunderbirds"", 'are', 'Go', 'rolls', 'complete', 'screenplay', 'nothing', 'short', 'amazing', 'difficulty', 'getting', 'puppets', 'walk', 'are', 'amazing', 'lifts', 'conveyors', 'get', 'pilots', 'cockpits', 'again', 'quite', 'fascinating.What', 'find', 'be', 'wonderful', 'additions', 'titles', 'are', 'special', 'featurettes', 'show', 'explain', 'how', 'puppets', 'were', 'designed', 'made', 'operated', 'producers', 'also', 'developed', 'art', 'perfection', 'own', 'as', 'well', 'ingenuity', 'used', 'get', 'puppets', 'talk', 'also', 'nothing', 'short', 'fascinating.What', 'be', 'noted', 'when', 'theses', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'was', 'not', 'interjection', 'computer', 'animation', 'films', 'today', 'yet', 'movies', 'can', 'still', 'hold', 'own', 'means', 'small', 'feat.The', 'current', 'price', 'real', 'bargain', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'one', 'additional', 'bonus', 'included', 'are', 'nicely', 'printed', 'card', 'board', 'punch', 'outs', 'thunderbirds', 'as', 'well', 'punch', 'fridge', 'magnets', 'main', 'puppet', 'characters']",Thunderbirds: 2 Movie Gift Set (Thunderbirds Are Go / Thunderbird 6)
822005,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B00022PZ56,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[3, 3]","Between September 1965 and December 1966, British TV viewers had the opportunity to watch a program featuring a family (the Tracy's) represented by marionettes.  The family members had devoted themselves to rescuing others (also played by marionettes) who had gotten themselves into various forms of trouble, usually due to some type of technical difficulty, weather or sabotage.  Calling themselves ""International Rescue"", the Tracy family was more popularly known by the various high-tech vehicles that they used: the Thunderbirds, which was also the name of the TV program.Consisting of 32 episodes (26 during its first season and 6 during its second), BBC-TV cancelled ""The Thunderbirds"" early into its second season.  Knowing that their show had been cancelled, the show creators, Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, produced a feature length film entitled ""Thunderbirds Are Go"" that was released in British theaters 10 days before the final television episode aired on December 25, 1966.  The film's fictional story was about the first manned space flight to Mars using a spacecraft called ""Zero-X"".  On take-off, the Zero-X crashes.  Two years later, an investigative committee concludes that the crash was due to sabotage.  With the impending take-off of the second Zero-X mission, mission commanders decide to ask International Rescue for assistance with security.  However, International Rescue has never provided security, as its mission has been limited to helping those who are already in trouble.  After thinking it over, John Tracy (voice of Ray Barrett) decides to assist.  Involved in the security efforts are Jeff Tracy (voice of Peter Dyneley), Gordon Tracy (voice of David Graham), Brains (voice also done by David Graham), Scott Tracy (voice of Shane Rimmer), Alan Tracy (voice Matt Zimmerman), Virgil Tracy (voice of Jeremy Wilkin), Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward (voice of Sylvia Anderson) and her chauffeur Parker (voice also by David Graham).  After the launch of Zero-X, its crew makes an interesting discovery on Mars before returning to Earth; but their return landing may require the International Rescue's assistance again.  Keeping up with what was then popular 1960's culture, the Anderson's created marionette versions of the British pop band ""Cliff Richards and the Shadows"" and featured the band's song ""Shooting Star"" in the film.Two years after ""Thunderbirds Are Go"" was released, one more Thunderbirds feature-length film was released: ""Thunderbird Six"".  At the beginning of ""Thunderbird 6"", Brains (voice of David Graham), the man who designed all of the Thunderbird ships, presents an idea to a private aircraft corporation to build an airship.  After being laughed at by the company's board of directors, they build the airship anyway because it is powered not by bags of hot air or lighter-than-air gas, but by a highly sophisticated anti-gravity device.  Shortly thereafter, the Tracy family patriarch, John Tracy (voice of Keith Alexander), asks Brains to design a new Thunderbird ship to be called Thunderbird 6.  Unfortunately, Brains' initial design is rejected and spends much of the rest of the film being upset as he tries to design something better.  In the meantime, Alan Tracy (voice Mark Zimmerman), Tin Tin (voice of Christine Finn), Lady Penelope (voice of Sylvia Anderson) and her chauffeur named Parker (voice of David Graham again), take an extended first ""cruise"" aboard the airship that Brains designed for the private aircraft corporation.  However, unknown to them, spies have replaced the airship's crew.Though no new Thunderbirds episodes or feature-length films were ever made using Gerry and Sylvia Anderson's ""supermarionation"" technique, a steady cult following of the show that has lasted nearly 40 years brought about the production of a live-action version that was released in theaters in 2004.  Aptly titled ""Thunderbirds"" and directed by long-time ""Star Trek"" actor Jonathan Frakes, the 2004 film did not live up to most Thunderbird aficionados' expectations.Overall, I rate the 1966 supermarionation film ""Thunderbirds Are Go"" and its sequel ""Thunderbird 6"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  It continues to be a very entertaining film even after nearly 40 years, though it may seem somewhat campy by today's standards.  Other TV series that the Anderson's successfully produced using supermarionation include ""Supercar"" (1960-1962, supermarionation), ""Fireball XL5"" (1962), ""Captain Scarlett and the Mysterons"" (1967) and ""Joe 90"" (1968).  After that, the Anderson's started producing live-action TV series that include ""U.F.O."" (1970-1971) and the more familiar ""Space: 1999"" (1975-1977).",4,"""The Thunderbirds"" Was One of Gerry & Sylvia Anderson's Best Supermarionations",1194134400,"11 4, 2007",2007,4646,"['September',
