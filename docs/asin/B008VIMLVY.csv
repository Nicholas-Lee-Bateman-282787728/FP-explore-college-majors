As I have stated in reviews of the previous titles, this is not a fully animated film, this is a motion comic which has a feel of a living breathing comic panel. If you are not into motion comics then this film isn't for you, if however you don't mind the animation style and are looking for something with a more adult theme then this is for you. I suppose this could work as a stand alone, but it really does go better after viewing the first 3 films. The only drawback is the fact that the movie is broken down into chapters that are about 10-15 minutes long and you have to watch the opening and closing credits after each episode/chapter.

I really love motion comics & Marvel Knights truly put's out tremendous work with all their releases thus far. This is the fourth arc in this X-Men tale & seeing John Cassidy's awesome art brought to life with subtle animation & great voice over's is better than going to the movies. Ironically, to me this whole four part series moves just like one long film & it has really hit all the top marks of what makes a true stand out X-men story. I'm surprised DC Comics & Warner Bros. doesn't put out more motion comics like this from some of their more popular & sought after works too. While I love the animated stuff, there's just something special about seeing awesome comic book illustration brought to life right from the pages from some of you favorite comic stories. As far as Marvel Comics is concerned I'd love to see them tackle other stuff like Spider-Man 2099, pretty much anything from Daredevil, or even Nova. Heck, I'd settle for the classic stuff from the 1960's & after too. But all in all, I highly recommend motion comics if you're itching to see something different. This is a seriously cool & innovative form of entertainment.",5,Astounding,1371254400,"06 15, 2013",2013,1237,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'final', 'volume', 'few', 'hours', 'ago', 'wow', 'just', 'great', 'stuff', 'really', 'love', 'motion', 'comics', 'Marvel', 'Knights', 'truly', 'put', 'out', 'tremendous', 'work', 'releases', 'thus', 'far', 'fourth', 'arc', 'X-Men', 'tale', 'seeing', 'John', 'Cassidy', 'awesome', 'art', 'brought', 'life', 'subtle', 'animation', 'great', 'voice', 'better', 'going', 'movies', 'Ironically', 'whole', 'four', 'part', 'series', 'just', 'one', 'long', 'film', 'really', 'hit', 'top', 'marks', 'what', 'true', 'stand', 'X-men', 'story', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'DC', 'Comics', 'Warner', 'Bros.', ""n't"", 'put', 'out', 'more', 'motion', 'comics', 'more', 'popular', 'sought', 'works', 'too', 'love', 'animated', 'stuff', 'just', 'something', 'special', 'seeing', 'awesome', 'comic', 'book', 'illustration', 'brought', 'life', 'right', 'pages', 'favorite', 'comic', 'stories', 'As', 'far', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'concerned', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'tackle', 'other', 'stuff', 'Spider-Man', '2099', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything', 'Daredevil', 'even', 'Nova', 'Heck', ""'d"", 'settle', 'classic', 'stuff', '1960', 'too', 'highly', 'recommend', 'motion', 'comics', ""'re"", 'itching', 'see', 'something', 'different', 'seriously', 'cool', 'innovative', 'form', 'entertainment']",Marvel Knights: Astonishing X-Men Unstoppable
