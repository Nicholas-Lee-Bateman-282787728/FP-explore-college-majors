272765,A3UPFTGAWZ3G2R,630192861X,David J. Loftus,"[1, 2]","Chuck Murdock is a good kid and a crack Little League pitcher from a small town in Montana. After taking a tour of nuclear missile siloes with his classmates, Chuck becomes obsessed by nuclear war and decides to stage a personal protest against it by refusing to play ball until the weapons are dismantled. A pro basketball player with the Boston Celtics named ""Amazing"" Grace Smith hears about Chuck's crusade and decides to join the kid's strike, moving out to Montana to be near him, annoying his agent (Jamie Lee Curtis), and convincing other pro athletes to come on board. All the notoriety turns the town against Chuck and his family, with his befuddled father (William Petersen) caught in the middle. Eventually, even the President (Gregory Peck) has to sit up and take notice. This Capra-like film, a classic what-one-person-can-achieve-if-he-puts-his-mind-to-it tale, is as sweet and clumsy as its title. Denver Nuggets star Alex English was a surprisingly photogenic and natural actor in his screen debut, and Red Auerbach cameo'd as himself. Director Mike Newell had mostly done TV before this 1987 effort, but would go on to make the much more accomplished ""Enchanted April"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral.""",3,Capra-like; simple and clumsy but sweet,1209686400,"05 2, 2008",2008,1221,"['Chuck', 'Murdock', 'good', 'kid', 'crack', 'Little', 'League', 'pitcher', 'small', 'town', 'Montana', 'taking', 'tour', 'nuclear', 'missile', 'siloes', 'classmates', 'Chuck', 'obsessed', 'nuclear', 'war', 'stage', 'personal', 'protest', 'refusing', 'play', 'ball', 'weapons', 'are', 'dismantled', 'pro', 'basketball', 'player', 'Boston', 'Celtics', 'named', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'Smith', 'Chuck', 'crusade', 'decides', 'join', 'kid', 'strike', 'moving', 'out', 'Montana', 'be', 'annoying', 'agent', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'convincing', 'other', 'pro', 'athletes', 'come', 'board', 'notoriety', 'town', 'Chuck', 'family', 'befuddled', 'father', 'William', 'Petersen', 'caught', 'middle', 'Eventually', 'even', 'President', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'sit', 'up', 'take', 'notice', 'Capra-like', 'film', 'classic', 'what-one-person-can-achieve-if-he-puts-his-mind-to-it', 'tale', 'sweet', 'clumsy', 'title', 'Denver', 'Nuggets', 'star', 'Alex', 'English', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'photogenic', 'natural', 'actor', 'screen', 'debut', 'Red', 'Auerbach', 'cameo', 'Director', 'Mike', 'Newell', 'had', 'mostly', 'done', 'TV', '1987', 'effort', 'would', 'go', 'make', 'much', 'more', 'accomplished', 'Enchanted', 'April', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral']",N/A

Then, I saw a news clip on CNN of the Berlin Wall coming down and I went to my colleagues and told them we needed to go to lunch.

Now there are players on the world stage who scoff at our rule book on civilized violence.
