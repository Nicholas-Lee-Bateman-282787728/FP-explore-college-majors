While the film interviews scientists, the level of information it provides seems ""dumbed down"".  Part of that may be that the film looks like it was made in Russia and the translation may not be capturing the message fully.I personally wanted more science.  I perform healing work in water ([...]) and I was looking for something I could use.  I have an engineering degree so my capacity to understand the science is better than average.

This was a world wide effort but the research, photography and production seems to be primarily Russian  and includes interviews with scientists and clergy and narrated in English. And since people are mostly water we too can absorb the imprints of our environment-good or bad- just as water does. Earth is apparently the only water planet in the known universe yet we take water for granted, waste and pollute it. Many topics are discussed here, such as holy water and structured water. We usually consume devitalized municipal and bottled water but here we see that sending good wishes to our water benefits us because that raises it's conciousness and vitality.
