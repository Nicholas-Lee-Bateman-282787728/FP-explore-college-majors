950829,ANY46RC9MF6DB,B000BVM1U0,"Anne ""Mystery Fan""","[9, 9]","This based-on-fact Lifetime TV movie, stars Poppy Montgomery as Generosa Ammon, a wealthy woman with two beautiful children who's married to a handsome and loving husband (David Sutcliffe).  She has everything a woman could want but she is compulsively determined to be dissatisfied and to make the people around her as unhappy as she is.When her husband asks for a divorce, he offers a settlement that would satisfy the needs of most small nations but Generosa thinks he's hiding money from her and wants to kill him.  Her lover and eventual husband is her contractor (Shawn Christian) a second rate criminal who gets carried away by having more money than he's ever dreamed of.Ultimately, the  situation is sad and unnecessary, leaving two small victims, the couple's children,  but nevertheless it is fascinating to watch, especially with Montgomery's very believable  performance as a greedy, selfish, and paranoid woman.",5,Murky Doings,1278892800,"07 12, 2010",2010,925,"['based-on-fact', 'Lifetime', 'TV', 'movie', 'Poppy', 'Montgomery', 'Generosa', 'Ammon', 'wealthy', 'woman', 'two', 'beautiful', 'children', 'who', 'married', 'handsome', 'loving', 'husband', 'David', 'Sutcliffe', 'everything', 'woman', 'could', 'want', 'compulsively', 'determined', 'be', 'dissatisfied', 'make', 'people', 'around', 'as', 'unhappy', 'husband', 'divorce', 'settlement', 'would', 'satisfy', 'needs', 'most', 'small', 'nations', 'Generosa', 'hiding', 'money', 'kill', 'lover', 'eventual', 'husband', 'contractor', 'Shawn', 'Christian', 'second', 'rate', 'criminal', 'who', 'carried', 'away', 'having', 'more', 'money', 'ever', 'dreamed', 'of.Ultimately', 'situation', 'sad', 'unnecessary', 'leaving', 'two', 'small', 'victims', 'couple', 'children', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'especially', 'Montgomery', 'very', 'believable', 'performance', 'greedy', 'selfish', 'paranoid', 'woman']",Murder in the Hamptons
