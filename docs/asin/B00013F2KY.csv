792057,A2I4VTPKGSQZ75,B00013F2KY,Anthony Hand,"[4, 10]","""Wish Me Luck"" was one of those quality British WWII dramas that turned up every now and then and resulted in an entertainment that is rarely found from other country's. The type of drama that the British have forgotten how to make as they look more and more to the US for indication of how to film drama.It's narrative focuses primarily on two women SOE agents, Liz Granger (Kate Buffery) and Matty Firman (Suzanna Hamilton), drawn from different backgrounds and thrown into the mix of wartime occupied France. They join up for various reasons, to ""do their part"", but both are unsatisfied with their lives up to that point and feel they can be doing more. Liz eventually 'graduates' as a general agent and Matty as a radio operator (or a pianist) and they're dropped onto the Continent to play out the first series.Once in France the first series develops into an episodic venture, with the plot played out over 8 parts. ""Wish Me Luck"" series one features fairly realistic characters in fairly realistic wartime situations. There's little 'action' in the traditional sense, but this in itself is real as the very nature of SOE ops called for quiet easy movement and information passing, rather than blowing things up. Sabotage was usually left to the various indigenous resistance groups, whose inter-rivalry is hinted at successfully throughout the series and continues into the later seasons.""Wish Me Luck"" relies more on driving characters than showing fancy gunfights and whiz-bang pyrotechnics, but one of the ways it chooses to develop character is one of the shows problems. The main writer, Jill Hyem, has seen fit to include hackneyed ""mills'n'Boon"" love interests to fill in the non-wartime bits and their troubled relationships are further complicated by their commitments back home. It's all a bit obvious and a little tiresome.Also somewhat tiresome is another of the show's angles. The character of Matty Firman. There's nothing really that bad with her character except that she carry's on with English colloquialisms all the way through France and the writing for her character seems hell bent on emphasising her working class contrast to Liz's more upper class 'jolly hockeysticks' upbringing. Another tedious and obvious 'twist' is to make her Jewish. I swear, it's becoming very hard to view a Second World War film or TV series without Jewish characters in it or the mention of Jews at some point. Not that it's inherently bad to have Jewish characters or a nod to Jews in wartime dramas at all, but when they are put obligingly into every piece that's produced about the period, it's hard to a)not be cynical about it or b)not to grow tired of it. If we are to believe film and TV's recent treatment of WWII, you think it impossible to move in Europe for the number of Jews there. There's little progression on Matty's racial/religious background and little reference to it as the series unfolds, it's just a clich&eacute;d, un-necessary and awkward insertion. But it seems to be obligatory nowadays. On the plus side, in general, she's one of the more plucky gals and Matty's story is one of the more interesting paths in the first series, even if the conclusion of her characters escapades is a little silly, if exciting enough.A more major downfall of the first series is the music used. It's never fitting and always somewhat overbearing. It seems that the music was written without the music director actually scoring the music to the film. It quickly becomes very irritating and it's a reason that the final star is knocked off. The music in the second series has changed and is a little better though, so it's obvious that the producers knew that it was a weak point in the production.Also somewhat out of place is Warren Clarke as Colonel Werner Krieger, the head of the Abwehr in the area. His affected German accent is a little cartoonish and caused a couple of unintentional chuckles. He's not bad in the role, he (and all of the Germans) just should have spoken in his natural English accent, like the 'French' characters in the series.The first series of ""Wish Me Luck"" is a worthy attempt to show a side of the war that doesn't get much of an airing, but it's leisurely pace may be off-putting to those with little or no interest in the period.",4,FANY's and WAAC's and WAAF's...oh my!,1216252800,"07 17, 2008",2008,4281,"['Wish', 'Me', 'Luck', 'was', 'one', 'quality', 'British', 'WWII', 'dramas', 'turned', 'up', 'now', 'then', 'resulted', 'entertainment', 'rarely', 'found', 'other', 'country', 'type', 'drama', 'British', 'have', 'forgotten', 'how', 'make', 'look', 'more', 'more', 'US', 'indication', 'how', 'film', 'drama.It', 'narrative', 'focuses', 'primarily', 'two', 'women', 'SOE', 'agents', 'Liz', 'Granger', 'Kate', 'Buffery', 'Matty', 'Firman', 'Suzanna', 'Hamilton', 'drawn', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'thrown', 'mix', 'wartime', 'occupied', 'France', 'join', 'up', 'various', 'reasons', 'do', 'part', 'are', 'unsatisfied', 'lives', 'up', 'point', 'feel', 'can', 'be', 'doing', 'more', 'Liz', 'eventually', 'general', 'agent', 'Matty', 'radio', 'operator', 'pianist', ""'re"", 'dropped', 'Continent', 'play', 'out', 'first', 'series.Once', 'France', 'first', 'series', 'episodic', 'venture', 'plot', 'played', 'out', '8', 'parts', 'Wish', 'Me', 'Luck', 'series', 'one', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'characters', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'wartime', 'situations', 'little', ""'action"", 'traditional', 'sense', 'real', 'very', 'nature', 'SOE', 'ops', 'called', 'quiet', 'easy', 'movement', 'information', 'passing', 'rather', 'blowing', 'things', 'up', 'Sabotage', 'was', 'usually', 'left', 'various', 'indigenous', 'resistance', 'groups', 'inter-rivalry', 'hinted', 'successfully', 'series', 'later', 'seasons', 'Wish', 'Me', 'Luck', 'more', 'driving', 'characters', 'showing', 'fancy', 'gunfights', 'whiz-bang', 'pyrotechnics', 'one', 'ways', 'develop', 'character', 'one', 'shows', 'problems', 'main', 'writer', 'Jill', 'Hyem', 'seen', 'fit', 'include', 'hackneyed', 'mills', ""n'Boon"", 'love', 'interests', 'fill', 'non-wartime', 'bits', 'troubled', 'relationships', 'are', 'further', 'complicated', 'commitments', 'back', 'home', 'bit', 'obvious', 'little', 'tiresome.Also', 'somewhat', 'tiresome', 'show', 'angles', 'character', 'Matty', 'Firman', 'nothing', 'really', 'bad', 'character', 'carry', 'English', 'colloquialisms', 'way', 'France', 'writing', 'character', 'hell', 'bent', 'emphasising', 'working', 'class', 'contrast', 'Liz', 'more', 'upper', 'class', ""'jolly"", 'hockeysticks', 'upbringing', 'tedious', 'obvious', ""'twist"", 'make', 'Jewish', 'swear', 'becoming', 'very', 'hard', 'view', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'film', 'TV', 'series', 'Jewish', 'characters', 'mention', 'Jews', 'point', 'Not', 'inherently', 'bad', 'have', 'Jewish', 'characters', 'nod', 'Jews', 'wartime', 'dramas', 'when', 'are', 'put', 'obligingly', 'piece', 'produced', 'period', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'cynical', 'b', 'not', 'grow', 'tired', 'are', 'believe', 'film', 'TV', 'recent', 'treatment', 'WWII', 'think', 'impossible', 'move', 'Europe', 'number', 'Jews', 'there', 'little', 'progression', 'Matty', 'racial/religious', 'background', 'little', 'reference', 'series', 'just', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'un-necessary', 'awkward', 'insertion', 'be', 'obligatory', 'nowadays', 'plus', 'side', 'general', 'one', 'more', 'plucky', 'gals', 'Matty', 'story', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'paths', 'first', 'series', 'even', 'conclusion', 'characters', 'escapades', 'little', 'silly', 'exciting', 'enough.A', 'more', 'major', 'downfall', 'first', 'series', 'music', 'used', 'never', 'fitting', 'always', 'somewhat', 'overbearing', 'music', 'was', 'written', 'music', 'director', 'actually', 'scoring', 'music', 'film', 'quickly', 'very', 'irritating', 'reason', 'final', 'star', 'knocked', 'off', 'music', 'second', 'series', 'changed', 'little', 'better', 'obvious', 'producers', 'knew', 'was', 'weak', 'point', 'production.Also', 'place', 'Warren', 'Clarke', 'Colonel', 'Werner', 'Krieger', 'head', 'Abwehr', 'area', 'affected', 'German', 'accent', 'little', 'cartoonish', 'caused', 'couple', 'unintentional', 'chuckles', 'not', 'bad', 'role', 'Germans', 'just', 'should', 'have', 'spoken', 'natural', 'English', 'accent', ""'French"", 'characters', 'series.The', 'first', 'series', 'Wish', 'Me', 'Luck', 'worthy', 'attempt', 'show', 'side', 'war', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'airing', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'may', 'be', 'off-putting', 'little', 'interest', 'period']",N/A

The quality in that respect is stellar. I bought the entire series after watching two episodes and have absolutely not been disappointed, so beware, because if you enjoy this period at all it is likely you will be spending money on the remaining episodes.Wish Me Luck is one of those rare (for me) British made series or movies that don't come across as third rate (at best) in terms of acting, screenplay, sets or storyline. The language and dialogue are very easy to understand and although complex at times remain simple to follow.This series of almost stand alone episodes takes the viewer from the inception of the British womens' spy service, and the resistance to its creation, through to (in later series) the end of the war, it depicts very clearly the struggles they faced, not only from their enemies but also from their friends overseas, who were often less than likely to accept a woman as a leader especially in time of war. It often takes the history of individual women from before joining or being recruited into the service through training, deployment, and eventual capture, death, or for the lucky ones, promotion and survival.It's excellent at demonstrating the worries and concerns of those left at home, how a husband has to deal with a wife or mother putting herself in mortal danger, how he reacts when she chooses service to country over servitude at home and the fractures that are ever present between mothers and children.Some of the most poignent parts are when these special individuals become betrayed, not in the line of duty, but by simple human meanness and small mindedness by supposed loved ones left in safety at home. It is truly entertaining on so very many levels.The various episodes take the viewer expertly through the atrocities of the Third Reich, avoiding the most graphic representations, while leaving little to the imagination. One gets to experience almost firsthand the pressures of life as a female spy in occupied Europe, the ever present threat of capture, the friends posted missing or known killed, the panic and the joy, the love and sorrow are all sewn expertly into this vivid tapestry of life in WW2 Europe.The sets, the costumes, the daily life episodes, all are woven into a rich background of espionage and intruge in the most human fashion imaginable.I bought the first series, followed quickly by the set, and will watch it many times over the comming years, as I actually found nothing that looked obviously ""fake"" or ""graphics generated"", or alerted the viewer strongly that this was a low budget effort and detracted from the series' main efforts to pull the watcher thoroughly into the period.",5,A Womans' War - Life as spies and commanders in occupied countries.,1290384000,"11 22, 2010",2010,2994,"['Wish', 'Me', 'Luck', 'British', 'bought', 'first', 'series', 'anticipating', 'chintzy', 'sets', 'average', 'acting', 'barely', 'credible', 'storylines.What', 'surprise', 'when', 'entire', 'series', 'turned', 'out', 'almost', 'aspect', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'detail', 'quality', 'professionalism', 'production', 'anyone', 'right', 'expect', 'made', 'TV', 'series', 'quality', 'respect', 'stellar', 'bought', 'entire', 'series', 'watching', 'two', 'episodes', 'have', 'absolutely', 'not', 'been', 'disappointed', 'so', 'beware', 'enjoy', 'period', 'likely', 'will', 'be', 'spending', 'money', 'remaining', 'episodes.Wish', 'Me', 'Luck', 'one', 'rare', 'British', 'made', 'series', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'third', 'rate', 'best', 'terms', 'acting', 'screenplay', 'sets', 'storyline', 'language', 'dialogue', 'are', 'very', 'easy', 'understand', 'complex', 'times', 'remain', 'simple', 'follow.This', 'series', 'almost', 'stand', 'alone', 'episodes', 'viewer', 'inception', 'British', 'womens', 'spy', 'service', 'resistance', 'creation', 'later', 'series', 'end', 'war', 'very', 'clearly', 'struggles', 'faced', 'not', 'only', 'enemies', 'also', 'friends', 'overseas', 'who', 'were', 'often', 'less', 'likely', 'accept', 'woman', 'leader', 'especially', 'time', 'war', 'often', 'history', 'individual', 'women', 'joining', 'being', 'recruited', 'service', 'training', 'deployment', 'eventual', 'capture', 'death', 'lucky', 'ones', 'promotion', 'survival.It', 'excellent', 'demonstrating', 'worries', 'concerns', 'left', 'home', 'how', 'husband', 'deal', 'wife', 'mother', 'putting', 'mortal', 'danger', 'how', 'when', 'service', 'country', 'over', 'servitude', 'home', 'fractures', 'are', 'ever', 'present', 'mothers', 'children.Some', 'most', 'poignent', 'parts', 'are', 'when', 'special', 'individuals', 'become', 'betrayed', 'not', 'line', 'duty', 'simple', 'human', 'meanness', 'small', 'mindedness', 'supposed', 'loved', 'ones', 'left', 'safety', 'home', 'truly', 'entertaining', 'so', 'very', 'many', 'levels.The', 'various', 'episodes', 'take', 'viewer', 'expertly', 'atrocities', 'Third', 'Reich', 'avoiding', 'most', 'graphic', 'representations', 'leaving', 'little', 'imagination', 'One', 'experience', 'almost', 'firsthand', 'pressures', 'life', 'female', 'spy', 'occupied', 'Europe', 'ever', 'present', 'threat', 'capture', 'friends', 'posted', 'missing', 'known', 'killed', 'panic', 'joy', 'love', 'sorrow', 'are', 'sewn', 'expertly', 'vivid', 'tapestry', 'life', 'WW2', 'Europe.The', 'sets', 'costumes', 'daily', 'life', 'episodes', 'are', 'woven', 'rich', 'background', 'espionage', 'intruge', 'most', 'human', 'fashion', 'imaginable.I', 'bought', 'first', 'series', 'followed', 'quickly', 'set', 'will', 'watch', 'many', 'times', 'comming', 'years', 'actually', 'found', 'nothing', 'looked', 'obviously', 'fake', 'graphics', 'generated', 'alerted', 'viewer', 'strongly', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'effort', 'detracted', 'series', 'main', 'efforts', 'pull', 'watcher', 'thoroughly', 'period']",N/A

They get the job done but it takes a toll. The ""WISH ME LUCK series ONE"" is based on the actual activity of women in Britain's Special Operations Executive (SOE). At the peak of WWII fighting, women did their part. This DVD set dramatically tells that story, complete with fantastic period sets, costumes, scenery, and hair. Almost as expertly done as the hugely successful (6-stars) war/home-front set ""Foyle's War: Series 1-5 - From Dunkirk to VE-Day"" (SEE MY REVIEW).Men & women train together for spy work and survival while in London and 3 from the group are sent together into occupied France for an operation. Liz ""Celeste"" (you'll need to connect them with their code names) played by Kate Buffery is married, wealthy, with a husband in the African front, and a daughter age 5. Matty ""Aimee"" (Suzanna Hamilton)is low class, 1/2 Brit, 1/2 French, & 1/2 Jewish. Both well know the area being sent and speak fluent ""Frog"". The 3rd is Colin ""Cyrano"" (Jeremy Northam-""Emma"") and they all meet French Resistance leader Kit ""Gregoire"" (Michael J. Jackson-not the former singer but from ""Mobile"", see my review). London SOE head is Col. ""Cad"" Cadogan (Julian Glover) and you also see lots of Faith (Jane Asher) a SOE exec in London.Setting up operations followed by receiving and sending data is crucial to the Allied war effort. It's tough, touch-&-go work. Many risks are taken creating plenty of suspense, intrigue, mystery, and a very realistic look into this special group of people from WWII. Who is helpful, who is the enemy, who can be trusted, where is safety, when and what is all addressed, but never the WHY? Each of the members in the operation have their own reasons for being prepared to give their all for the success of the mission......The 8 episodes in the Series 1 combine for one continuing story, one operation with some set-backs, some losses, some successes, and even some romance. A very good presentation of historical fiction done so well that it's hard to forget you are not watching a dramatized documentary. Plenty of sub-plots.THIS SHOULD BE SHOWN TO EVERY MILITARY PERSON, MEN AND WOMEN.

792071,ADQU6C7DE6VD2,B00013F2KY,J. Faulk,"[15, 26]","I am an enthusiast of British tv drama series and miniseries. This Series 1 (8 episodes) of 3, however, is misconceived and earns no compliments.In World War II, Special Operations recruits blonde willowy Liz Grainger as an agent, though she has a 5-year-old daughter and a husband in non-combat military service. A social class or two below her is Matty Firman, a determined scrappy kinda cockney Jewish girl who volunteers. Their training in cryptography, self defense, and physical fitness is quickly run through, and they are flown into France.Now the script writers can come up with little of dramatic event to fashion a worthy story. Liz seeks out an old French acquaintance, Claudine de Valois, to put her up and provide some assistance. Matty, as a wireless telegrapher, has to stay on the move. Liz carries a few messages back and forth, and leans toward an involvement with agent Kit Varston, a relentless fount of security warnings. Matty transmits a few messages, carelessly leaving her code book lying around. Finally she's hauled into Col. Werner Krieger, who's rather nice, not the standard Nazi bastard. Claudine is the Colonel's mistress, and he soon coerces her to become a double agent, and into betraying Matty. In the meantime Liz has returned to England (after perhaps no more than 6 weeks in France), but finds her daughter alienated and her returned husband condemnatory of her military service. Matty is tortured in an out-of-sight kind of way, so as not to offend all those female viewers who have the estrogen to stick with this limp adventure. Liz returns to France, and assists in an Underground rescue attempt to save Matty, contrary to orders from on high. On the homefront, orange-haired Faith Ashley, as Spec Ops liaison for the female agents, is repeatedly on screen, bringing personal messages, little gifts, and limited explanations to family members. All in all, hardly enough dramatic structure to sustain 8 episodes.Matty twice takes off her dress to stymie inrushing Germans. The second time she even has recreational sex with a male agent (Jeremy Northam, the only name likely to be familiar to today's viewers). The two clinch-and-kiss moments between Liz and agent Kit are just awkward. The only one who cries in this series is Liz's husband (""I just can't cope""). Just remembered, Matty's mum, well on her way to a nervous breakdown, cries too.The series touches on male undervaluation of females, class snobbishness, anti-Semitism, anti-Commies, anti-English sentiments in the French Underground. The music, 1940s lounge muzak, is distracting and non-supportive. Budget seems limited. Dialogue, direction, and acting attain a workaday level. Everything and everybody succumbs to  the mediocre script. Series 2 and 3, I've read, carry over some of the characters, but each series introduces two new female agents to lead the story, and a better-fitting music score. Still, I am not tempted to pedal down this bicycle path in the French countryside any farther.

792074,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00013F2KY,Joseph Haschka,"[22, 40]","WISH ME LUCK, a British telly miniseries that aired in the late 1980s, revolves around the perils facing English agents working with the Resistance in WWII occupied France.Female viewers are the target audience for this melodrama. Real Men need not tune in. The shtick to draw in the gels is the fact that the two main protagonists are women. Liz Grainger (Kate Buffery), a young English housewife and mother, whose husband is serving with the Royal Army in Egypt and whose brother has been killed flying for the RAF, volunteers for clandestine duty as a courier in Normandy while leaving her pre-pubescent daughter with Mum. Half-French, half-English Matty Firman (Suzanna Hamilton), who escaped the German invasion with her French mother to live with her English grandfather in Stepney, is teamed with Liz as a radio operator, even though she has a tendency to leave mission-sensitive material lying about.  A third member of the team is Colin Beale, played by an adolescent Jeremy Northam.  Women in the audience will think him cute.While there are tense moments as our heroines find themselves in dodgy spots, the plot focuses mostly on emotional relationships: Matty with Liz, Matty with Colin, Liz with her husband, Liz with her daughter, and Liz with her control behind the lines.Beyond the touchy-feeliness, which may leave male eyes glazed over, this is too obviously a low budget production - except for the rather striking period hairstyles on several of the female characters. The cheesiness is in the details. The Teutonic invaders are less Aryan and more out of UK central casting. And when they speak Deutsch among themselves, the awkward tone and overly careful pronunciation is reminiscent of memorized speech drills in first year German. Moreover, though Liz and Matty are exhorted in spy school to act like Frenchwomen when on assignment, the latter in particular, once in enemy territory, punctuates loud conversations with Bloody This, Bloody That, and Sod This - all potentially within the hearing of any leather-coated Gestapo ape skulking on the nearest street corner.A decidedly more clever and much better spy series from the UK is THE SANDBAGGERS, broadcast in the late 70s and featuring an MI6 covert operations team. And if you want to see a truly excellent WWII period piece enjoyable by both sexes, I recommend FOYLE'S WAR, currently in it's third season, the first two of which are available on DVD.",3,A spy series for the gels,1094860800,"09 11, 2004",2004,2431,"['ME', 'LUCK', 'British', 'telly', 'miniseries', 'aired', 'late', '1980s', 'revolves', 'perils', 'facing', 'English', 'agents', 'working', 'Resistance', 'WWII', 'occupied', 'France.Female', 'viewers', 'are', 'target', 'audience', 'melodrama', 'Real', 'Men', 'need', 'not', 'tune', 'shtick', 'draw', 'gels', 'fact', 'two', 'main', 'protagonists', 'are', 'women', 'Liz', 'Grainger', 'Kate', 'Buffery', 'young', 'English', 'housewife', 'mother', 'husband', 'serving', 'Royal', 'Army', 'Egypt', 'brother', 'been', 'killed', 'flying', 'RAF', 'volunteers', 'clandestine', 'duty', 'courier', 'Normandy', 'leaving', 'pre-pubescent', 'daughter', 'Mum', 'Half-French', 'half-English', 'Matty', 'Firman', 'Suzanna', 'Hamilton', 'who', 'escaped', 'German', 'invasion', 'French', 'mother', 'live', 'English', 'grandfather', 'Stepney', 'teamed', 'Liz', 'radio', 'operator', 'even', 'tendency', 'leave', 'mission-sensitive', 'material', 'lying', 'about', 'third', 'member', 'team', 'Colin', 'Beale', 'played', 'adolescent', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'Women', 'audience', 'will', 'think', 'cute.While', 'are', 'tense', 'moments', 'heroines', 'find', 'dodgy', 'spots', 'plot', 'mostly', 'emotional', 'relationships', 'Matty', 'Liz', 'Matty', 'Colin', 'Liz', 'husband', 'Liz', 'daughter', 'Liz', 'control', 'lines.Beyond', 'touchy-feeliness', 'may', 'leave', 'male', 'eyes', 'glazed', 'too', 'obviously', 'low', 'budget', 'production', 'rather', 'striking', 'period', 'hairstyles', 'several', 'female', 'characters', 'cheesiness', 'details', 'Teutonic', 'invaders', 'are', 'less', 'Aryan', 'more', 'UK', 'central', 'casting', 'when', 'speak', 'Deutsch', 'awkward', 'tone', 'overly', 'careful', 'pronunciation', 'reminiscent', 'memorized', 'speech', 'drills', 'first', 'year', 'German', 'Moreover', 'Liz', 'Matty', 'are', 'exhorted', 'spy', 'school', 'act', 'Frenchwomen', 'when', 'assignment', 'latter', 'particular', 'once', 'enemy', 'territory', 'loud', 'conversations', 'Bloody', 'Bloody', 'That', 'Sod', 'potentially', 'hearing', 'leather-coated', 'Gestapo', 'ape', 'skulking', 'nearest', 'street', 'corner.A', 'decidedly', 'more', 'clever', 'much', 'better', 'spy', 'series', 'UK', 'THE', 'SANDBAGGERS', 'broadcast', 'late', '70s', 'featuring', 'MI6', 'covert', 'operations', 'team', 'want', 'see', 'truly', 'excellent', 'WWII', 'period', 'piece', 'enjoyable', 'sexes', 'recommend', 'FOYLE', 'WAR', 'currently', 'third', 'season', 'first', 'two', 'are', 'available', 'DVD']",N/A

The story follows a number of British men and women who have been recruited to go undercover in German Occupied France during the Second World War.  Their mission is to work with the French Resistance to create havoc behind the lines and to pass vital intelligence onto the British government back home.  One of the things that the British do so very well in their dramas is character development and this is, in my opinion anyway, the great strength of WIsh Me Luck.  One becomes involved with the various principle characters -- they assume a dimension and vitality that is often lacking in more action-oriented stories.  This leads me to the second point -- if you are expecting something chock full of exploding bunkers, elaborate battle scenes, or thrills and chills from lots of action and special effects, then you will certainly be disappointed.  This is an intricate drama, revolving around the people who volunteered for a very dangerous mission. It centers on why they felt compelled to serve their country in this way, the effects their decisions had on their families back home, on the emotional and psychological stresses they endured while undercover, etc., etc.  It's quite a different sort of perspective from the Guns of Navarone, or Where Eagles Dare -sort of WWII movies.

But it's not put together well. The Editor did an amateur job and so the cuts and scenes are roughly assembled. And what's with the music? Out nowhere it comes, too loud, too long, and inappropriate for the scene or mood. I felt like a night club band had sneaked up behind my chair to give me a surprise.The music was a bit lighter after episode 1 but it always seemed inappropriate as the episodes continued. There were some terrible gaffes in the plot such as Amy staying in the same place after the Germans had raided and caught her, and giving personal information to a fellow prisoner. This would not have happened, we know all the agents received training against that. Hey author, if you don't allow Amy's character to grow, then you make her into a fool. There were frequent instances where the agents were talking loudly in public that would not have happened. Celeste was prowling around town in her second visit without any attempt to disguise herself when she already knew her cover was blown, and Claudette should have gotten out of town the moment that she was finished covering Amy's escape, not waiting to be arrested. These mistakes are just the beginning of a large list that are so glaring that I can't enjoy the show.So, a good cast and a good story idea are ruined by a sloppy production.

One bozo even thought that this was a stage play, really?; all the outside shots too?. Smart reviewers know that this doesn't matter a bit and just enjoy the storylines. Of course they didn't have alot of monehy like a american show , but they did a great job here telling true stories of women operatives in France. Because this is true we don't get a typical war movie , which is all action and little characterization, instead we get the first series of a hit show from the 1980's. Brit shows are lucky to have more than a series and this one lasted at least three and that's a good thing. This starts off slowly and gets alot better as the agents go overseas and begin their missions. IF you are low attention person who is infantile and must have constant action and no characterization and reality then please avoid this one. DOn't get me wrong , I do like movies that are all action however like the no characterization 'shoot em up': those movies have their places too,  but they structurally are not great storytelling to  a degree. This is great storytelling with realized characters and it's just like a book would be on the subject. Unless you just read all the battle scenes. The videotape has held up well , as compared to other brit shows like 'flickers' from 1980 , which is full of artifacts. SO at least someone saved the mastertapes of these alot better.  If you like character dramas you will like this series, if you are only action related and expect modern film techniques then forget about it.",5,ignore the ignorants and just enjoy true stories of women at war.,1318118400,"10 9, 2011",2011,1739,"['When', 'pre', '1990', 'brit', 'tv', 'always', 'get', 'few', 'ignorants', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'give', 'bad', 'reviews', 'due', 'fact', 'shot', 'episodes', 'video', 'tape', 'different', 'look', 'film', 'One', 'bozo', 'even', 'thought', 'was', 'stage', 'play', 'really', 'outside', 'shots', 'too', 'Smart', 'reviewers', 'know', ""n't"", 'matter', 'bit', 'just', 'enjoy', 'storylines', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'alot', 'monehy', 'american', 'show', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'telling', 'true', 'stories', 'women', 'operatives', 'France', 'true', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'typical', 'war', 'movie', 'action', 'little', 'characterization', 'instead', 'get', 'first', 'series', 'hit', 'show', '1980', 'Brit', 'shows', 'are', 'lucky', 'have', 'more', 'series', 'one', 'lasted', 'least', 'three', 'good', 'thing', 'slowly', 'alot', 'better', 'agents', 'go', 'overseas', 'begin', 'missions', 'are', 'low', 'attention', 'person', 'who', 'infantile', 'must', 'have', 'constant', 'action', 'characterization', 'reality', 'then', 'please', 'avoid', 'one', 'DO', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'do', 'movies', 'are', 'action', 'however', 'characterization', 'em', 'up', 'movies', 'have', 'places', 'too', 'structurally', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'storytelling', 'degree', 'great', 'storytelling', 'realized', 'characters', 'just', 'book', 'would', 'be', 'subject', 'just', 'read', 'battle', 'scenes', 'videotape', 'held', 'up', 'well', 'compared', 'other', 'brit', 'shows', ""'flickers"", '1980', 'full', 'artifacts', 'SO', 'least', 'someone', 'saved', 'mastertapes', 'alot', 'better', 'like', 'character', 'dramas', 'will', 'like', 'series', 'are', 'only', 'action', 'related', 'expect', 'modern', 'film', 'techniques', 'then', 'forget']",N/A
792081,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,B00013F2KY,"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie""","[2, 2]","Tale focuses on the British SOE (Special Operations Executive) who recruit and train British women who have backgrounds that will let them pass as French women in Nazi occupied France during WWII. For those so interested the SOE really existed and was created in 1940 by Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Minister of Economic Warfare Hugh Dalton to conduct guerrilla warfare against the Axis and to instruct and aid local resistance movements. The main characters include an aristocratic woman and a factory worker who train together with others and are later sent to the same area of Nazi occupied France to go undercover and gradually gain crucial pieces of information. This series is much more interested in the characters and dialogue, especially how the war wears them down and affects the heads of SOE as well as loved ones back in England. The series was on a budget at times. Indoors felt like the stage of a play and there were some minor moves by the characters here and there that didn't make sense or were things operatives would never do (I can't list the main points without giving spoilers). There are some nice touches in here as to how to appear French or German compared to English (i.e. how you take your tea, etc) but one of the agents seems to resort to using British swear words out in public and even though it seems private you just would not do that. Sometimes the music helps the scene but other times, especially during those rare action scenes, it sometimes works against it. Jazzy music for action scenes during the 50s and 60s was in but not so much in the late 80s and on. While there are criticisms the series was done particularly well in other areas: the characters, their dialogue and as I said above the grinding down of agents overseas and back home, as well as their loved ones. Other than the music and the slips by one of the agents this series seems pretty tight and interesting. I'll try the next season out (there are three).

I loved this series - especially the first two seasons - and believe them to be worthy of repeated viewing.Season one stars the exceptional Kate Buffery as Liz Grainger (Celeste) and Suzanna Hamilton as Matty Firman (Amy), both stationed in France. At home in London, helping direct their activities, is Jane Asher, who plays Faith Ashley. Two notable male characters are Michael J. Jackson, as Kit (special agent Gregoire) and a young Jeremy Northam as Colin (viewers may remember the talented Northam as Mr. Knightley in Jane Austen's Emma,Sir Robert Morton in The Winslow Boy, and Sir Thomas More in The Tudors).Kate Buffery, who appears in all three seasons, steals the show with her enviable combination of inner strength and self-control as well as gentleness and vulnerability. Suzanna Hamilton is well-cast as the boisterous but occasionally bumbling wireless operator. However, the carelessness of her character is likely to leave the viewer wishing that she was just a little less obviously asking to be caught.Nevertheless, I loved season one - its presentation of true war heroines (and heroes), the very risks they took, the plight of their helpers in occupied France, the Germans who were attempting to discover them, and the struggles of those at home in Britain who feared for their safety. Quietly suspenseful, the series also manages to give us a taste of forbidden romance, as Celeste and Gregoire touchingly bond through their work and their grief, while struggling to contain their feelings. Only the British seem able to portray a budding romance with such graceful subtlety.Viewers of WISH ME LUCK might be interested to know that the SOE was actually created in 1940 by Winston Churchill, and that 13 British SOE women died in occupied France while serving as special agents. Notable SOE women include Violette Szabo (killed by the Gestapo, and whose life is portrayed in the 1958 film, Carve Her Name with Pride), and Odette Churchill, who survived World War II.I also personally recommend two other films about actual WWWII women who actively opposed the Nazis - Sophie Scholl: The Final Years, and the Train (which introduces us to Rose Valland).",5,A wonderful portrayal of women special agents in occupied France,1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,2358,"['ME', 'LUCK', 'British', 'series', 'based', 'lives', 'British', 'female', 'special', 'agents', 'serving', 'occupied', 'France', 'part', 'SOE', 'Special', 'Operations', 'Executive', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'loved', 'series', 'especially', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'believe', 'be', 'worthy', 'repeated', 'viewing.Season', 'one', 'exceptional', 'Kate', 'Buffery', 'Liz', 'Grainger', 'Celeste', 'Suzanna', 'Hamilton', 'Matty', 'Firman', 'Amy', 'stationed', 'France', 'home', 'London', 'helping', 'direct', 'activities', 'Jane', 'Asher', 'who', 'Faith', 'Ashley', 'Two', 'notable', 'male', 'characters', 'are', 'Michael', 'J.', 'Jackson', 'Kit', 'special', 'agent', 'Gregoire', 'young', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'Colin', 'viewers', 'may', 'remember', 'talented', 'Northam', 'Mr.', 'Knightley', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Emma', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'Morton', 'Winslow', 'Boy', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'More', 'Tudors', '.Kate', 'Buffery', 'who', 'three', 'seasons', 'show', 'enviable', 'combination', 'inner', 'strength', 'self-control', 'as', 'well', 'gentleness', 'vulnerability', 'Suzanna', 'Hamilton', 'well-cast', 'boisterous', 'occasionally', 'bumbling', 'wireless', 'operator', 'However', 'carelessness', 'character', 'likely', 'leave', 'viewer', 'wishing', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'less', 'obviously', 'asking', 'be', 'caught.Nevertheless', 'loved', 'season', 'one', 'presentation', 'true', 'war', 'heroines', 'heroes', 'very', 'took', 'plight', 'helpers', 'occupied', 'France', 'Germans', 'who', 'were', 'attempting', 'discover', 'struggles', 'home', 'Britain', 'who', 'feared', 'safety', 'Quietly', 'suspenseful', 'series', 'also', 'give', 'taste', 'forbidden', 'romance', 'Celeste', 'Gregoire', 'touchingly', 'bond', 'work', 'grief', 'struggling', 'contain', 'feelings', 'Only', 'British', 'seem', 'able', 'portray', 'budding', 'romance', 'such', 'graceful', 'subtlety.Viewers', 'WISH', 'ME', 'LUCK', 'might', 'be', 'interested', 'know', 'SOE', 'was', 'actually', 'created', '1940', 'Winston', 'Churchill', '13', 'British', 'SOE', 'women', 'died', 'occupied', 'France', 'while', 'serving', 'special', 'agents', 'Notable', 'SOE', 'women', 'include', 'Violette', 'Szabo', 'killed', 'Gestapo', 'life', 'portrayed', '1958', 'film', 'Carve', 'Her', 'Name', 'Pride', 'Odette', 'Churchill', 'who', 'survived', 'World', 'War', 'II.I', 'also', 'personally', 'recommend', 'two', 'other', 'films', 'actual', 'WWWII', 'women', 'who', 'actively', 'opposed', 'Nazis', 'Sophie', 'Scholl', 'Final', 'Years', 'Train', 'Rose', 'Valland']",N/A

All in all-the series is worth watching-though I would recomend rental rather than purchase--if you can find a video store that rents it!Honestly, I would recomend either &quot;Enemy at the Door&quot; or &quot;Piece of Cake&quot; over &quot;Wish Me Luck&quot;--but if you've seen those two series and enjoyed them-chances are you would enjoy this one as well",3,Good soap-ok drama--worth watching,1082246400,"04 18, 2004",2004,1099,"['decent', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'quot', 'Enemy', 'Door', 'quot', 'similar', 'type', 'melodrama-with', 'superior', 'stories', 'acting', 'However', 'like', 'WW2', 'stories-this', 'nice', 'set', 'watch', 'rent/own', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'bad', 'stories-but', 'events', 'sometimes', 'strain', 'credulity-example', 'Matty', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'ride', 'bicycle-but', 'manages', 'keep', 'up', 'Liz', 'problem', 'lengthy', 'bicycle', 'journey', 'arriving', 'France', 'few', 'escapes', 'capture', 'are', 'little', 'unbelievable', 'well-at', 'one', 'point', 'Liz', 'bicycle', 'woods', 'eventually', 'losing', 'making', 'way', 'foot', 'somehow', 'managing', 'evade', 'escape', 'Germans', 'dogs', 'are', 'chasing', 'are', 'minor', 'flaws', 'all-the', 'series', 'watching-though', 'would', 'recomend', 'rental', 'rather', 'purchase', 'can', 'find', 'video', 'store', 'Honestly', 'would', 'recomend', 'quot', 'Enemy', 'Door', 'quot', 'quot', 'Piece', 'Cake', 'quot', 'quot', 'Wish', 'Me', 'Luck', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'two', 'series', 'enjoyed', 'them-chances', 'are', 'would', 'enjoy', 'one', 'as', 'well']",N/A

I find it quite good, easy to follow the plot, very believable, well acted, and enjoyable. The plot involves a little known British espionage agency that supplies spies and saboteurs to occupied France during Nazi occupation of greater Europe in WWII. The main characters are 2 women ( it is clear that the use of women is contrary to the desires of the male leaders of the agency) who are sent to France to support the allies reporting on German movments and troop strength, etc. Entwined in that plot is a local French woman forced to act as a double agent against the women, one of whom was her best friend during boarding school days.
