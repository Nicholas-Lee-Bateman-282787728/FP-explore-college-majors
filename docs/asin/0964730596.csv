However, he needs for someone else to pay all his bills there so takes a bet, that he can turn a young nobody seen on the beach into a credible writer that he can use to raise ...millions while in Cannes.  Not a single word has been written but Sy sees that as no impediment to approaching every star in the universe to become involved in his movie, with virtually all of them saying yes, from Johnny Depp to Dennis Hopper to John Malkovich and so on. A hilarious, droll view at the film world that is light as a souffle.

Yes, it is slightly interesting to see the Cannes environment, but not enough to watch this film. It could be a cure for insomnia, though.  Fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed.  You can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen, and it's really just very boring. All those fans of Johnny Depp: be particularly warned.
