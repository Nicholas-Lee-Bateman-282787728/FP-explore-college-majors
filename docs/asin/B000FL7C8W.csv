The fourth season was good, and still pretty funny, but true Fresh Prince fans know that this was when the show started its swan song. First of all, the real Aunt Viv was gone, replaced by Daphne Maxwell Reid. The Vivian Banks character was useless from that point to the end of the series. Next was the addition of the new child, Nicky, which only brought the morale of the series down even more. Like ""Fresh Prince"" really needed another kid. The Nicky character was useless as well. Will and Carlton are pretty much the same, Ashley (she can sing!) finally shows some depth, and Uncle Phil shines, becoming, in a sense, the true heart and soul of the show. The fourth season really offers very few classic Fresh Prince episodes, but there is still some good entertainment here, and a few memorable moments: Carlton experiencing heartbreak from his first lover, Uncle Phil taking Will and Carlton to court, Will attempt to book Boyz II Men to perform at Nicky's christening, one of Uncle Phil's old flames honing in on Will, and the return of Will's father, who talks a big game but ends up leaving Will in heartbreak, leading to one of the most heartfelt scenes in the show's history (Will's teary testimony to Uncle Phil still gives me chills). So, this season is not without its moments, but the best days of ""The Fresh Prince"" are clearly behind it.And by the way, the final two seasons of this show need to be released. It has been over a year since this DVD set was released and nothing new has come from ""The Fresh Prince"". It is stupid that this show has been put on ice while worse shows have seen full-series runs.

The chemistry between Uncle Phil & the new Vivian isn't quite as strong, but Reid would acclimate herself to Aunt Viv in no time at all. Season Four opens with Will & Carlton moving out of the mansion & into their own apartment in ""Where There's A Will, There's A Way"" - a two-part episode. The boys find they have more freedom on their own, but soon run into trouble when they start fraternizing heavily by having a neighborhood party. The aftermath doesn't sit too well with their landlord, who evicts Will & Carlton, who goes home to Phil & Vivian, while Will toughs it out, first staying with Jazz before moving back into the mansion. While babysitting Nicky, Will encounters people at the Peacock who think Will's a father in the episode ""Father of the Year"". Will & Carlton pledge a fraternity on campus, but the head of the club wants only Will in the club in ""Blood Is Thicker Than Mud"". Things become serious on the homefront when Phil has a heart attack in ""Home Is Where The Heart Attack Is"", so Vivian puts her husband on a strict diet. Will sneaks in fast food to Philip. Will doesn't find college life exactly fun & games in the episode ""All Guts, No Glory"", where he must take a tough philosophy course to graduate this semester. Phil winds up taking the boys to court when Will & Carlton refuse to pay their rent in ""Will Goes A Courtin'"". Boyz II Men guest-stars when they attend & sing at Nicky's christening in ""'Twas the Night Before Christening"". Will has a difficult time studying for final exams due to a disturbance of a cricket in the house in the episode ""Sleepless In Bel-Air"", & Will has to take orders from boss Carlton at the Peacock in the episode ""Who's The Boss"". Will decides he'd rather sell cars than attend college in the episode ""You'd Better Shop Around"", featuring guest-star Robert Guillaume as Will's boss. In spite of a slight downturn in casting & quantity, ""Season Four"" is still a great season to stay tuned to the hilarity & chaos of the Banks family.

992383,A1HFVQZIDK7UUD,B000FL7C8W,E.J. Rupert,"[9, 10]","The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air - The Complete Fourth SeasonThe fourth season of ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" isn't the best season but it still had a lot of funny episodes. The first two episodes are probably the funniest, especially the second one where Hilary's fianc&eacute; Trevor hurts himself bungee-jumping on TV. Philip then says, ""Let's just hope Trevor's okay."" Cut to the next scene, everyone's in black and Philip says, ""Well, it was a lovely service.""The problem with this season was the new Vivian. Daphne Maxwell-Reid is a good actress but it's hard to top Janet Hubert-Whitten's version. Janet made Vivian feisty and a take-no-mess type while Daphne's sterile version made it hard to watch (the writers must have known that too, maybe that's why Daphne wasn't in that many episodes). The good news with that is that the focus shifts from Vivian and onto the other characters, which in turn makes them stronger (see Will in ""Papa's Got a Brand New Excuse"" - my favorite episode).The problem with the DVD set is that it looks rushed. Even the menu appears half-hearted compared to previous ""Fresh Prince"" sets. Also, there are no special features at all - but I guess that's not a big loss because all I usually watch are the episodes and the special features in previous sets weren't all that special, as someone mentioned earlier.This season shows that the show wasn't on its death bed just yet.

992393,A3INQQEX56YKJV,B000FL7C8W,PSF,"[0, 0]","While Season 4 of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air will forever remain notorious for the Aunt Vivian Banks character role handover from Janet Hubert-Whitten to Daphne Maxwell-Reid, that surprise (to the prime-time audience of 1993-1994) reality fortunately did not damage the aura of the other characters on the show.  Will and Carlton maintain their love-hate relationship with one another; Hilary is ever the self-righteous snothead; Uncle Phil never loses sight of his household authority or irritation towards Will; Geoffrey [The] Butler maintains his genius dignity and hilarity; and on top of it all (despite being the baby of the family), Ashley expresses her more human side as she experiences life as a teenager going full steam ahead and astounds everybody in her family with her newfound womanhood on every level.Recurring characters--Will's season-long girlfriend, Jackie (played by the youthful model/actress, Tyra Banks); as well as Jazz's ex-con of a wife--enter the scene in a fiery way, adding to the onscreen laughs and talent beautifully.  Even Will's mother makes two cameos--first in ""You Better Shop Around"", threatening the life of Will's supervisor at the car dealer for encouraging Will to drop out of school and become a full-time car salesman strictly for the sake of financial profit (her back-to-back-to-back pairs of cutthroat lines in that episode give her, and it, a million gold stars!: [to Will] ""Boy, where do you get off DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL?!"" ... ""Oh really?  [grab's Will by the ear] Does THIS FEEL GOOD?"" [to Will's boss, Mr. Fletcher] ""Who the hell are you?!"" ... ""Oh, so you're the SNAKE that LURED my boy out of that institution of HIGHER LEARNING!"" ... ""Oh really?  You ever been beat up by a woman?!""  [Mr. Fletcher] ""Not without having paid for it.  Will, I'll be in my office hiding under the desk if you need me.""  The second cameo of Will's mother (bearing a more straightforward character tone than in ""You Better Shop Around"") occurs in the season finale, ""The Philadelphia Story""--when Will and the Banks Family head east to his hometown and learn some startling facts about Will's reputation in the city of supposed brotherly love!I second the opinions of many Amazon reviewers regarding the highlighted episodes from this season.  On the whole, I will say that certain characters' lines really gave Season 4's episodes the punch that made them memorable.  And since this was the second season of the Fresh Prince that I watched in full on DVD (the first was Season 1), I must say that the two years have quite a lot in common--particularly given the fact that they each began a new era in the series's history.  And if there is one chapter in television that will never end its value, it bears the title, ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air""!",5,"Still fresh, and ever-the-prince, after four years running!!!!",1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,2786,"['Season', '4', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'Bel-Air', 'will', 'forever', 'remain', 'notorious', 'Aunt', 'Vivian', 'Banks', 'character', 'role', 'handover', 'Janet', 'Hubert-Whitten', 'Daphne', 'Maxwell-Reid', 'surprise', 'prime-time', 'audience', '1993-1994', 'reality', 'fortunately', 'did', 'not', 'damage', 'aura', 'other', 'characters', 'show', 'Will', 'Carlton', 'maintain', 'love-hate', 'relationship', 'one', 'Hilary', 'ever', 'self-righteous', 'snothead', 'Uncle', 'Phil', 'never', 'sight', 'household', 'authority', 'irritation', 'towards', 'Will', 'Geoffrey', ']', 'Butler', 'genius', 'dignity', 'hilarity', 'top', 'being', 'baby', 'family', 'Ashley', 'more', 'human', 'side', 'life', 'teenager', 'going', 'full', 'steam', 'ahead', 'everybody', 'family', 'newfound', 'womanhood', 'level.Recurring', 'characters', 'Will', 'season-long', 'girlfriend', 'Jackie', 'played', 'youthful', 'model/actress', 'Tyra', 'Banks', 'as', 'well', 'Jazz', 'ex-con', 'wife', 'enter', 'scene', 'fiery', 'way', 'adding', 'onscreen', 'laughs', 'talent', 'beautifully', 'Even', 'Will', 'mother', 'two', 'cameos', 'first', 'Better', 'Shop', 'threatening', 'life', 'Will', 'supervisor', 'car', 'dealer', 'encouraging', 'Will', 'drop', 'school', 'become', 'full-time', 'car', 'salesman', 'strictly', 'sake', 'financial', 'profit', 'back-to-back-to-back', 'pairs', 'cutthroat', 'lines', 'episode', 'give', 'million', 'gold', 'stars', '[', 'Will', ']', 'Boy', 'where', 'do', 'get', 'off', 'DROPPING', 'OUT', 'SCHOOL', 'Oh', 'really', '[', 'grab', 'Will', 'ear', ']', 'THIS', 'FEEL', 'GOOD', '[', 'Will', 'boss', 'Mr.', 'Fletcher', ']', 'Who', 'hell', 'are', 'Oh', ""'re"", 'SNAKE', 'LURED', 'boy', 'institution', 'HIGHER', 'LEARNING', 'Oh', 'really', 'ever', 'been', 'beat', 'up', 'woman', 'Mr.', 'Fletcher', ']', 'Not', 'having', 'paid', 'Will', ""'ll"", 'be', 'office', 'hiding', 'desk', 'need', 'second', 'cameo', 'Will', 'mother', 'bearing', 'more', 'straightforward', 'character', 'tone', 'Better', 'Shop', 'season', 'finale', 'Philadelphia', 'Story', 'when', 'Will', 'Banks', 'Family', 'head', 'east', 'hometown', 'learn', 'startling', 'facts', 'Will', 'reputation', 'city', 'supposed', 'brotherly', 'love', 'second', 'opinions', 'many', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'regarding', 'highlighted', 'episodes', 'season', 'whole', 'will', 'say', 'certain', 'characters', 'lines', 'really', 'gave', 'Season', '4', 'episodes', 'punch', 'made', 'memorable', 'was', 'second', 'season', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'watched', 'full', 'DVD', 'first', 'was', 'Season', '1', 'must', 'say', 'two', 'years', 'have', 'quite', 'lot', 'common', 'particularly', 'given', 'fact', 'began', 'new', 'era', 'series', 'history', 'one', 'chapter', 'television', 'will', 'never', 'end', 'value', 'title', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'Bel-Air']",The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air: Season 4

992397,A55TEBW8H4PYN,B000FL7C8W,Trevor R. Raichura,"[8, 9]","First, my two complaints about this DVD collection. 1) Daphne Maxwell Reid is not half the Vivian that her predecessor was. In fact, I find that the new Vivian gets on my nerves. She is not the same character as she was in the past. They may as well have written in a divorce and re-marriage or something! 2) This season has no special features. I guess this isn't the worst thing, since the first three seasons' ""special features"" were not so special in the first place!Having gotten those two things out of the way, this season gives us as many laughs as previous seasons, and even has some extremely serious moments to boot. Will and Carlton face new challenges and adventures as college freshmen. Hilary mourns the tragic death of her fianc&eacute; Trevor. Ashley continues to embrace young adulthood, even if the rest of the family is unwilling to allow her to grow up. There is wonderful on-screen chemistry/tension between Will and Jackie (played by Tyra Banks). Other special appearances are made by Robert Guillaume, Hugh Hefner, Donald Trump, and Boyz II Men.Here are some of season 4's highlights:All Guts, No Glory: Will faces the challenge of sticking with a class that forces him to try.Father of the Year: Will receives extra attention from the ladies when they believe he is a single dad.Blood is Thicker Than Mud: Will and Carlton attempt to work their way into a college fraternity. Unfortunately, Carlton is not seen as ""black enough.""Home is Where the Heart Attack is: Philip promises to try to lose weight, but Will sneaks him burgers to satisfy his cravings. A heart attack results.`Twas the Night Before Christening: Philip explains to little Nicky how he received 4 middle names at his christening. Special appearance: Boyz II MenWho's the Boss?: Carlton becomes manager of the Peacock Stop, and Will learns what Geoffrey knew all along: life isn't easy when you work for a Banks.I Know Why the Caged Bird Screams: Carlton, ULA's mascot (the pigeon) gets kidnapped by their rivals before the big game.You'd Better Shop Around: Will decides to drop out of college to sell cars.Papa's Got a Brand New Excuse: Will's father comes to pay him a visit, making many promises to spend more time with his son. (This episode is a real tear-jerker.)The Philadelphia Story: The Banks family takes a trip to Philly, only to find out that Will has become a joke in his hometown.As in my previous reviews, I have only highlighted my personal favorite episodes - they're all good! A warning to those who might watch this as a family: the content in this season is racier than in all others! A lot more innuendo and sexual content!
