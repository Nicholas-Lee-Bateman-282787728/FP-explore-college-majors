120714,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,0790751097,Craig Connell,"[0, 0]","This movie never got much acclaim for some reason. When I read where Clint Eastwood said it was a personal favorite of his I smiled, because it's mine, too.....and I like a lot of Eastwood's movies.This isn't just my favorite Eastwood film. It's one of my all-time favorite - period! That's probably because it has tremendous charm, with a good mixture of comedy and drama with characters you care about. It's definitely different from most of Clint's movies.The famous Eastwood glare when he's mad is still there, and he still shows his violent side. However, it's not a violent story, just a tale of a modern-day man and his little troupe who want to play cowboys and Indians, and go on tour with their little Wild West show.The film has nice, colorful photography and looks great on DVD. However, the story, not the visuals, is the main attraction. It's refreshing to see Eastwood play a role like this where he's a Mr. Rogers-type western hero for little kids, urging children to stay on the straight and narrow, mind their parents and say their prayers before going to bed at night.Sondra Locke also is effective as the cold newcomer who reluctantly joins the group and slowly changes from a mean-spirited, sarcastic woman to a caring person. She shows a good comedic touch and is excellent in this film, perhaps her best effort since ""The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter.""The rest of the cast is fun to watch, too, and the always-fascinating face and voice of ""Scatman"" Crothers.I've said this for 20 years, but I still think it's Eastwood's most underrated movie.",5,"One Of My All-Time Favorites, Too",1233187200,"01 29, 2009",2009,1563,"['movie', 'never', 'got', 'much', 'acclaim', 'reason', 'When', 'read', 'where', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'said', 'was', 'personal', 'favorite', 'smiled', 'mine', 'too', '..and', 'like', 'lot', 'Eastwood', 'movies.This', ""n't"", 'just', 'favorite', 'Eastwood', 'film', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'period', 'probably', 'tremendous', 'charm', 'good', 'mixture', 'comedy', 'drama', 'characters', 'care', 'definitely', 'different', 'most', 'Clint', 'movies.The', 'famous', 'Eastwood', 'glare', 'when', 'mad', 'still', 'there', 'still', 'violent', 'side', 'However', 'not', 'violent', 'story', 'just', 'tale', 'modern-day', 'man', 'little', 'troupe', 'who', 'want', 'play', 'cowboys', 'Indians', 'go', 'tour', 'little', 'Wild', 'West', 'show.The', 'film', 'nice', 'colorful', 'photography', 'great', 'DVD', 'However', 'story', 'not', 'visuals', 'main', 'attraction', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Eastwood', 'play', 'role', 'where', 'Mr.', 'Rogers-type', 'western', 'hero', 'little', 'kids', 'urging', 'children', 'stay', 'straight', 'narrow', 'mind', 'parents', 'say', 'prayers', 'going', 'bed', 'night.Sondra', 'Locke', 'also', 'effective', 'cold', 'newcomer', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'group', 'slowly', 'changes', 'mean-spirited', 'sarcastic', 'woman', 'caring', 'person', 'good', 'comedic', 'touch', 'excellent', 'film', 'perhaps', 'best', 'effort', 'Heart', 'A', 'Lonely', 'Hunter', 'rest', 'cast', 'fun', 'watch', 'too', 'always-fascinating', 'face', 'voice', 'Scatman', 'Crothers.I', ""'ve"", 'said', '20', 'years', 'still', 'think', 'Eastwood', 'most', 'underrated', 'movie']",N/A

Everybody knew that these films wouldn't be hits, they were little presents offered to the successful actor. Thanks to these minor movies, Clint Eastwood is now considered, at least in Europe, as one of the major american film directors.BRONCO BILLY, shot in 1980, is a good surprise for the Eastwood fan. Starring Sondra Locke, Geoffrey Lewis Scatman Crothers, Sam Bottoms and Clint, the movie has all the ingredients of a good comedy. Witty and heartful. The show presented by Clint and his friends is hilarious and the relations between Bronco and the children very well developed.

Clint (who also directs) plays a cowboy in charge of an old fashioned, travelling rodeo show.  He has a bunch of rag tag people in his company, but they have a deep sense of community, and they do care for each other.  Billy ends up in many jams in this film, but his ""family"" stick it out, with a little help from the people around the country that Bronco Billy has performed for before.  They even take in a rich ""b**tch"" character (played by Sondra Locke, then Clint's girlfriend), and she's a bit much at times, but she isn't nearly as bad as others have said she is.  The film is shot on location in the upper Northeast (specifically Idaho), and it really enhances the film.  There isn't a trace of ""irony"" or any smugness here, which really helps the film in the long run.  Clint has said in many interviews that he really liked this film, and that it is one of his personal favorites.  He thought it could combat the prevailing cynicism of the day.  The song over the end credits is really cheesy, but the film itself is nicely done.A funny note.  Scatman Crothers did this film shortly after completing his work on Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.  For those who don't know, Scatman played the chef who has the power of shine like Danny.  Kubrick was notorious for doing many takes in all his films, but on The Shining the take ratio was astronomical.  In reading about the filming, take totals went as high as 148 on some of Scatman's shots.  I read that on the first day of shooting on Bronco Billy, Scatman got his scene on the first take, and Clint said ""let's move on"", and Scatman almost broke down in tears because he was so happy and relieved.

120731,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,0790751097,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[14, 19]","Bronco Billy is a character in the tradition of classic westerns of the 20th century.  Billy is fair and honest, and he watches out for children.  Except for some of the things he does, Bronco Billy bears some resemblance to Roy Rogers.  However, when Billy does not get his way, which seems to happen a lot, he can be manipulative.One of Bronco Billy's biggest problems is getting a young woman to be an assistant.  Being an assistant for Billy involves being a target for knives, holding up plates so Billy can shoot them, and jumping on the back of a horse ridden by Billy.  Billy's latest assistant just quit at the same time that obnoxious Antoinette Lilly's husband abandons her in the same town Bronco Billy's wild west show is playing.  Antoinette needs help, since all her husband left her was a nightgown, andBilly needs an assistant.Antoinette turns out to be a huge pain in the behind.  She is smart-mouthed, cynical, obnoxious and arrogant (I may have missed a few adjectives, but you can fill those in yourself).  On the other hand, Antoinette can shoot and other than being a snob, she can handle the assistant part.Even though I am not a big fan of Sondra Locke, part of what makes this movie work is how Antoinette's observations of Billy slowly change her attitude toward the world.  She sees that Billy is honest and caring.  She also sees how selfless Billy and his team are.  Between the jokes, the changes in Antoinette as the movie progresses are important to the end of the movie.Whenever I look at my DVD collection for a movie to watch, I somehow seem to always pass over this movie.  Yet, when I finely get around to watching it, I am always glad I did.  I am unable to explain exactly why that is the case.  Regardless, this movie is a charmer and one of my favorite Clint Eastwood comedies.  If you have enjoyed Clint Eastwood's other comedies, I believe you will like this one.Enjoy!",4,Clint Carries on the Classic Tradition of the West,1203120000,"02 16, 2008",2008,1913,"['Bronco', 'Billy', 'character', 'tradition', 'classic', 'westerns', '20th', 'century', 'Billy', 'fair', 'honest', 'out', 'children', 'things', 'Bronco', 'Billy', 'resemblance', 'Roy', 'Rogers', 'However', 'when', 'Billy', 'not', 'get', 'way', 'happen', 'lot', 'can', 'be', 'manipulative.One', 'Bronco', 'Billy', 'biggest', 'problems', 'getting', 'young', 'woman', 'be', 'assistant', 'Being', 'assistant', 'Billy', 'being', 'target', 'knives', 'holding', 'up', 'plates', 'Billy', 'can', 'shoot', 'jumping', 'back', 'horse', 'ridden', 'Billy', 'Billy', 'latest', 'assistant', 'just', 'quit', 'same', 'time', 'obnoxious', 'Antoinette', 'Lilly', 'husband', 'same', 'town', 'Bronco', 'Billy', 'wild', 'west', 'show', 'playing', 'Antoinette', 'help', 'husband', 'left', 'was', 'nightgown', 'andBilly', 'assistant.Antoinette', 'out', 'be', 'huge', 'pain', 'behind', 'smart-mouthed', 'cynical', 'obnoxious', 'arrogant', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'few', 'adjectives', 'can', 'fill', 'other', 'hand', 'Antoinette', 'can', 'shoot', 'other', 'being', 'snob', 'can', 'handle', 'assistant', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Sondra', 'Locke', 'part', 'what', 'movie', 'work', 'how', 'Antoinette', 'observations', 'Billy', 'slowly', 'change', 'attitude', 'world', 'Billy', 'honest', 'caring', 'also', 'how', 'selfless', 'Billy', 'team', 'are', 'jokes', 'changes', 'Antoinette', 'movie', 'progresses', 'are', 'important', 'end', 'movie.Whenever', 'look', 'DVD', 'collection', 'movie', 'watch', 'somehow', 'seem', 'always', 'pass', 'movie', 'when', 'finely', 'get', 'watching', 'am', 'always', 'glad', 'did', 'am', 'unable', 'explain', 'exactly', 'why', 'case', 'Regardless', 'movie', 'charmer', 'one', 'favorite', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'comedies', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'other', 'comedies', 'believe', 'will', 'like', 'one.Enjoy']",N/A

Bronco Billy really delivered a memorable story. Though it's truly offbeat for Eastwood, he fits into the character of Billy perfectly and delivers a perfect performance. Clint is just great in the role. In fact the entire cast does a great job and the characters they play slowly become those that you actually care about and enjoy watching. This is not Oscar stuff here, but this film will surprise you because you might not expect much at all considering the subject matter revolving around a bunch of ""down and out"" circus performers trying to make a living. Sondra Locke delivers what I believe to be her best performance, and gives life to what could have easily been a really forgettable character. She can play a b**ch great, but also delivers a convincing portrait of transformation to a more likable person. Also (as usual) Scatman Crothers does a very good job. I really admire many of his performances and fans of Mr. Crothers will like him in this film a great deal even though his part is less majestic than others he has played.
