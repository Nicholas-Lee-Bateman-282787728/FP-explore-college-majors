315346,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6302484413,Annie Van Auken,"[3, 3]","Hot on the heels of her smashing success inSOME LIKE IT HOT(1959), Marilyn Monroe's final ""glamor girl"" film LET'S MAKE LOVE turned out to be a surprising failure. Surprising that is until we examine the whys and wherefores.Right at the outset, Monroe, who was slated to appear opposite Gregory Peck, demanded rewrites. During these star-imposed delays, Peck encountered other obligations and he bowed out of the production. Next, several leading men flatly turned the film down, including Jimmy Stewart, Chuck Heston, Bill Holden, Yul Brynner, Rock Hudson and Cary Grant. When director George Cukor suggested to Marilyn that they hire the unknown-in-America Yves Montand, she happily agreed with the choice. This was almost the last time star and director would work together harmoniously-- they never even spoke to each other while filming.Sadly, Monroe's dual addictions to alcohol and barbiturates are both plainly evident in the finished work. In some scenes she's obviously glassy-eyed and dull-witted; in others so bloated as to appear 20 lbs. heavier than in the previous shot. Her talent remained intact though: MM's performance of Cole Porter's ""My Heart Belongs to Daddy"" remains among her very best, while a warm on-screen rapport with both Montand and Frankie Vaughan seems genuine.The English-born Vaughan was a popular crooner in his native land but never caught on in America. A pity, for he had a marvelous voice-- similar to Tony Bennett's, a bit rougher perhaps but with more power and clarity. His rendition of ""Incurably Romantic"" on SONY'sLET'S MAKE LOVEsoundtrack CD is strikingly beautiful. (This entire album is highly recommended, for it contains complete true stereo takes of songs heard only partially in the film.)MOVIE SYNOPSIS--Billionaire Jean-Marc Clement (Montand) learns he's to be spoofed in an off-Broadway show, so he goes to the rehearsals where he's mistakenly hired to play himself. After seeing her perform ""Daddy,"" Clement falls hard for star Amanda Dell (Monroe), and to impress her (and win the lady's heart) Jean-Marc hires three famous performers to teach him how to tell jokes, sing and dance. Amanda does eventually warm up to this supposedly struggling bit player. When he finally admits the truth to her, Jean-Marc cannot get Amanda to believe he really IS the fabulously wealthy industrialist.""Let's Make Love"" is a pleasant story draped around several wonderful numbers that's far better than first-run audiences gave it credit for.  (TRIVIA: The Elvis-clone is played by ""King of the Surf Guitar,"" Dick Dale.)Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(6.3) Let's Make Love (1960) - Marilyn Monroe/Yves Montand/Tony Randall/Frankie Vaughan/Wilfrid Hyde-White/David Burns/Joe Besser (uncredited: Bing Crosby/Gene Kelly/Milton Berle/Madge Kennedy/Dick Dale)",4,"""Don't just lay there... honey, DO something!

I've always been a fan of Marilyn's, so I finally figured I'd give it a shot - and man, I'm glad I did! I simply loved this movie! I thought Marilyn did a great job, the story was adorable, and I loved the cameos of Milton Berle, Gene Kelly, & Bing Crosby! Now granted, Yves Montand didn't seem right to play Marilyn's love interest. He seemed too old for her, but I was surprised when I looked his bio up and found out he was only 5 years her senior. As the movie played, I will he admit he started to grow on me. The ending was just great (I won't give it away), and the musical numbers were quite pleasant. I'm still surprised that the reviews for this film were not as favorable as I felt they should've been. Bus Stop got great reviews, and it was not my favorite film.

315352,A2P49WD75WHAG5,6302484413,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[5, 8]","When billionaire Jean-Marc Clement hears a theatre company is going to be roasting him in a satire on celebrities, he goes down to the theatre to see what the hullabaloo is about.  There, he sees Cole Porter's &quot;My Heart Belongs To Daddy&quot; number, sung by a blonde actress, Amanda Dell with male dancers.  He is smitten and because this is a comedy, he is mistaken for a Clement impersonator and hired by Oliver Burton, head of the production.  Also, because this is a comedy and an eye-rolling one at that, he takes the name Alexander Dumas.  Both Dumas pere and fils were probably churning in their graves at that one.He learns that Amanda doesn't like Clement one bit.  &quot;I heard they're going to make a real idiot out of him&quot; she says, also saying of him he's a rich louse.  Insulted, he tells her off, but she, clueless of his real identity, praises him by saying it's a perfect impression of Clement, which mollifies him.  He tries to get closer to Amanda by trying to get her help on acting technique and asking her out.  She on her part is friendly and encouraging, but she's taking night classes to get what would today be a GED.  Worse for him, she's the girlfriend of song and dance man Tony Danton, played by Frankie Vaughan, whom he is definitely jealous of.Clement lacks show business talent and through his PR man Alexander Coffman, gets a joke from Lamont, played by ex-Three Stooge Joe Besser, which backfires.  Hiring Milton Berle, Bing Crosby, and Gene Kelly (who play themselves in guest cameos) for comedy, singing, and dancing.The rehearsal for the &quot;Specialization&quot; number is humiliating for Clement.  After all, Clement is known as a notorious womanizer, and to his chagrin, he is forced to accompany the line &quot;crow from the barnyard roost&quot; by cockle-doodle-dooing like a real rooster.  Others roasted in this number are Maria Callas, Elvis Presley, and pianist Van Cliburn, which is a snapshot of who was big in 1960.The best observation on human nature comes from Coffman, who learning that the theatre has been demanded a year's rent in advance and that the theatre's real estate firm belongs to Clement, asks the bartender for three double bourbons, then goes into this bitter spiel.  &quot;Somebody once said that rich people are only poor people with money.  Well, he was lying.  Rich people aren't people, my friend.  Oh, they can be charming, democratic, polite.  You can hardly tell them from a human being sometimes.  Just be good and sure you don't cross them.&quot;Another good insight is a conversation between Coffman and Clement.  When people talk to Clement, they don't talk to him, they talk to his money, hence Coffman's calling him &quot;sir.&quot;  The importance of distinguishing people from their money is noted here.Apart from the Cole Porter number, the other numbers are forgettable.  This is far from MM or Yves Montand's most memorable performances.  Montand is miscast in this part, and it's understandable why celebrities ranging from Gregory Peck, Cary Grant, Yul Brynner, and James Stewart turned it down.  All in all, a waste of talent given the cast involved, including Tony Randall, Wilfrid Hyde-White, and director George Cukor.Critics panned this and wrote off Monroe's career, even saying she was putting on some pounds.  However, the script, idea, dialogue, lack of likeable characters (except Amanda and Coffman) and lack of oomph are more to blame.  MM was trying to breathe life into a movie doomed from the start and did her best.  Unfortunately, it didn't save this cockle-doodle-doo of a picture.

315353,A1TJRWJ7C7F9MX,6302484413,dean59,"[0, 0]","This is probably Marilyn Monroe's worst film as a star, and she's one of the reasons--but only one. The first is the script; the plot basically follows the Doris Day/Rock Hudson sex comedy outline of the time: the man tries to get the girl (who is predisposed to despise him) by pretending to be someone else; the comedy comes out him trying to maintain the impersonation, she falls in love with the fake him, eventually discovers the real him, hates him then loves him, fadeout.It's a calculated, mechanical formula, and for it to work at all it has to be constructed and filmed that way--sharp, shiny-bright and plasticized. But the script blurs things by making the billionaire not a cad (as Hudson always was) who's only interested in getting the girl into bed and then falling for her. From the beginning he's besotted with Monroe, which eliminates the mechanistic tension and conflict. And the resolution is limply lazy; there's no twist or definite marker to show why Monroe forgives him; he just starts crooning sexily and she melts.All of this is compounded by Cukor's direction, which absurdly tries to give us a gritty, bohemian, &#34;realistic&#34; view of the Greenwich Village theater scene, which just puts a drab blanket over things, goes against the cold, heartless pacing this kind of movie needs to work at all, and can't be sustained anyway, given that the play the theater group is putting on is clearly not the underground satire on the rich we're told it is, but merely a sub-Broadway musical comedy with glitzy-tacky production numbers.Poor Marilyn is strike three. It's an awful performance; Monroe, when used well and carefully, could be effective, but as is glaringly exposed here, she utterly lacked the professional resources to pull off routinely straightforward and crisp line readings and reactions. The scene when she discovers the billionaire's ruse is cringingly amateurish;  any third-string contract player from the era would have been able to snap out the (bad) dialogue with easy, practiced smoothness, and to pull off the basic, easy facial expressions needed for the uncomplicated emotions involved. She is bleary, vague, stumbling, wanderingly out of focus.

I gave the film the 3 stars for MM!  Marilyn is fine her performance, but it's no Cheree' from Bus Stop.  This film reverts back to her older films, cutesy musical movies with cheesy plots. I thought that Gentlemen prefer Blondes was a much better musical and a better movie. Let's make Love is lacking..I found Yves Montand to be so boring and a bad actor!!! He just didn't go well with Marilyn at all.  It amazes me that she had an affair with him; I think maybe the fact that he bares a slight resemblence to Joe Dimaggio may have something to do with that.  And the fact that she was very depressed and estranged from her husband at the time, Arthur Miller probably didn't help either. The movie does offer some entertaining musical numbers, but the first half hour of it is SO BORING!!!!! I fast forward through it now.  The scenes with Marilyn are the best.  Also the cameos of Gene Kelley, Milton Berle, and Bing Crosby help to make this film a little more watchable.  The script is awful! Aside from Yves' wooden performance, the rest of the acting is fine.  I always find Tony Randall so amusing in his earlier films.  I'd have to say the first scene with Marilyn, when she performs &quot;My heart belongs to Daddy&quot; makes the film worth purchasing for one's Marilyn collection.  I think you can only truly appreciate this film if you are a big admirer of her's. The movie itself is a big flop, and from what I've read Marilyn thought so, too.

Having said I consider that film M.M's least interesting role, I now stand self- corrected. This film, &quot;Let's Make Love&quot;, is truly Marilyns least interesting role, so much so, that I conveniently erased it from my memory. It is not only her lousiest movie, but an  all-around turkey, with an awful script, that even an Arthur Miller re-write couldn't help....an un-intelligible Yves Montand doing impressions of a walrus, and is filmed through some sort of lens that makes  Marilyn look like Doris Day on quaaludes. This film was a necessity under her old Fox contract, and she hated the non-role from the get-go. In viewing her annotated scripts for this film, they have the fewest &quot;notes&quot; to herself, than any of her other scripts, which can all be viewed in Christies auction catalog. She simply had no part to work with. Every star has at least several films they've made that they wished they hadn't done, and I'm sure this was one of M.M.'s. Yes, there was all the behind-the-scenes drama on this film, the troubled M.M.-Miller marriage, the M.M.- Montand affair...if they apparently had chemistry off screen, they didn't save any for this film. All the big name cameos, Gene Kelly, Milton Berle, ...look embarressed. And even George Cukor's directing skills couldn't make this spruce goose fly. Some people can overlook a bad film just because of a stars presence, with M.M.'s fans being among the most loyal. But, though I consider myself one of her biggest admirers, I feel her unique talent and image should be seen, if not at her best, than at least in a role of SOME interest. This film does not even have the basic redeeming quality which almost all of her films possess, a magical M.M. screen image. She looks wan, woeful, and bored.

this is the movie that's supposed to be horrible?! yet mm was so good in just one scene?"" then curiosity caught me. i had to see if this movie was bad or good. as it turned out, it is both...the whole movie, at least the comedy factor, seems to be strained & tensed. like they make the lamest jokes hoping to get a laugh. so the script is not very good. but that doesn't stop the plot from being lame. it is very interesting; to see how jean marc (yves montand) will play a satire of himself just to win MM's heart. and she isn't a fan of him either. yves is a famous billionaire and mm is an actress in broadway theatre. initially i did not like mr. montand, his voice, him. but he grew on me, after i watched this a few more times, and i began to really like him. maybe b/c thru his character. jean m is very sweet, and always gets treated badly by the theatre people (he isn't funny or talented). and i began to feel very sorry for him. i think yves played this character well. i love his accent, but i do not like his voice. i'm still in awe of how he was actually a successful singer. one part you will love yves/jean marc in, is his ""mime"" act of a man getting on to a train. after he gets milton berle to assist him. he is very good and entertaining! it is a humorous piece. mariyln and all the theatre people clap thunderously for him. you will love that scene!... i absolutely love mm and frankie vaughn in the ""specializtion"" numeber. that song is so good it should be a classic! mm is her usual charming, sexy self, and Vaughn has a wonderful voice...but there are many tedious, mundane, useless, boring parts in this movie. that's what makes it bad. i just fast forward it. it is mainly, when jean m would talk with his friends (the old man and/or tony randall). i felt they were really trying to take up time with it. i was very irked. that's what a lot of movies do...it cannot be denied that mm does look tired, overweight and weary. her acting is like the movie; shines only sometimes. but i liked how she was now playing ""marilyn monroe--the ordinary, working class girl."" we all know she was many other types before; gold digger, ukellee singer, spectacled, half-blind gold digger, e.t.c. it was refreshing, strange, but nontheless interesting to see her in this role. and she has an awesome voice too! it is showcased in this movie...you must also see this for m's beauty! she doesn't look beautiful sometimes, but it seems like when she has the right hair & make up, she's one of the most beautiful women in the world. it is the scenes when she and yves rehearses singing on the bench, when she jogs thru the street with him embarassingly lagging behind ( this is her most beautiful in the movie!!), he drops her to her house and tells her she shouldn't work so hard, when she goes in to confront ""mr. jean marc"" (with the real one with her!), and the ending in the elevator when he tries to win her back...i think it is b/c she has tons of eye make up on. white instead of black. it is a great 60's look... the ending is wonderful and humorous b/c mm goes in to confront jean m (for trying to take the theatre) when he is really with her all along! and when she finds out who he is and runs into the elevator, and he comes in, i don't know, but to me, it is one of the sweetest, sexiest, most romantic scenes i've seen. he hugs her sexily from behind, feels her hair with his mouth, nuzzles her neck, all while she scolds him, but you can tell by her half smile she is just talking hot air, and really does forgive him for his ""trick."" then he sings the ""lets make love"" song for a few seconds and they sexily kiss. it is all so sexy! yves & mm are so beautfiful together! his most handsome is the ending...so as i said the movie is not great, but there are many good scenes that you should still get it. i think it is worth buying & watching. especially if you're a true mm fan.",4,get it to see the ending & MM at her most beautiful!!,1170288000,"02 1, 2007",2007,4491,"['i', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'watch', 'legendary', 'MM', 'movie', 'not', 'legendary', 'good', 'way', 'bad', 'way', 'i', 'had', 'read', 'mm', 'books', 'had', 'heard', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'terrible', 'course', 'i', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'spend', 'hearing', 'curiosity', 'did', 'not', 'stir', 'then', 'saw', 'mm', 'bio', 'dvd', 'clip', 'performing', 'heart', 'daddy', 'i', 'sat', 'entranced', 'watching', 'mm', 'work', 'usual', 'cute', 'innocent', 'meets', 'sexy', 'sexual', 'act', 'i', 'also', 'loved', 'idea', 'was', 'taking', 'role', 'Lolita', 'song', 'then', 'i', 'saw', 'performance', 'was', 'lets', 'make', 'love', 'i', 'said', 'wait', 'min', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'horrible', 'yet', 'mm', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'just', 'one', 'scene', 'then', 'curiosity', 'caught', 'i', 'had', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'bad', 'good', 'turned', 'out', 'whole', 'movie', 'least', 'comedy', 'factor', 'be', 'strained', 'tensed', 'make', 'lamest', 'jokes', 'hoping', 'get', 'laugh', 'script', 'not', 'very', 'good', ""n't"", 'stop', 'plot', 'being', 'lame', 'very', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'jean', 'marc', 'yves', 'montand', 'will', 'play', 'satire', 'just', 'win', 'MM', 'heart', ""n't"", 'fan', 'yves', 'famous', 'billionaire', 'mm', 'actress', 'broadway', 'theatre', 'initially', 'i', 'did', 'not', 'mr.', 'montand', 'voice', 'grew', 'i', 'watched', 'few', 'more', 'times', 'i', 'began', 'really', 'like', 'maybe', 'b/c', 'thru', 'character', 'jean', 'm', 'very', 'sweet', 'always', 'treated', 'badly', 'theatre', 'people', ""n't"", 'funny', 'talented', 'i', 'began', 'feel', 'very', 'sorry', 'i', 'think', 'yves', 'played', 'character', 'well', 'i', 'accent', 'i', 'do', 'not', 'voice', 'i', ""'m"", 'still', 'awe', 'how', 'was', 'actually', 'successful', 'singer', 'one', 'part', 'will', 'love', 'yves/jean', 'marc', 'mime', 'act', 'man', 'getting', 'train', 'milton', 'berle', 'assist', 'very', 'good', 'entertaining', 'humorous', 'piece', 'mariyln', 'theatre', 'people', 'clap', 'thunderously', 'will', 'love', 'scene', 'absolutely', 'love', 'mm', 'frankie', 'vaughn', 'specializtion', 'numeber', 'song', 'so', 'good', 'should', 'be', 'classic', 'mm', 'usual', 'charming', 'sexy', 'self', 'Vaughn', 'wonderful', 'voice', 'are', 'many', 'tedious', 'mundane', 'useless', 'boring', 'parts', 'movie', 'what', 'bad', 'i', 'just', 'fast', 'forward', 'mainly', 'when', 'jean', 'm', 'would', 'talk', 'friends', 'old', 'man', 'tony', 'randall', 'i', 'felt', 'were', 'really', 'trying', 'take', 'up', 'time', 'i', 'was', 'very', 'irked', 'what', 'lot', 'movies', 'do', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'mm', 'look', 'tired', 'overweight', 'weary', 'acting', 'movie', 'only', 'sometimes', 'i', 'liked', 'how', 'was', 'now', 'playing', 'marilyn', 'monroe', 'ordinary', 'working', 'class', 'girl', 'know', 'was', 'many', 'other', 'types', 'gold', 'digger', 'ukellee', 'singer', 'spectacled', 'half-blind', 'gold', 'digger', 'e.t.c', 'was', 'refreshing', 'strange', 'nontheless', 'interesting', 'see', 'role', 'awesome', 'voice', 'too', 'showcased', 'movie', 'must', 'also', 'see', 'm', 'beauty', ""n't"", 'look', 'beautiful', 'sometimes', 'when', 'right', 'hair', 'make', 'up', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'world', 'scenes', 'when', 'rehearses', 'singing', 'bench', 'when', 'jogs', 'thru', 'street', 'embarassingly', 'lagging', 'most', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'house', 'should', ""n't"", 'work', 'so', 'hard', 'when', 'confront', 'mr.', 'jean', 'marc', 'real', 'one', 'ending', 'elevator', 'when', 'win', 'back', 'i', 'think', 'b/c', 'tons', 'eye', 'make', 'up', 'white', 'instead', 'black', 'great', '60', 'look', 'ending', 'wonderful', 'humorous', 'b/c', 'mm', 'confront', 'jean', 'm', 'trying', 'take', 'theatre', 'when', 'really', 'when', 'out', 'who', 'elevator', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', 'sweetest', 'sexiest', 'most', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hugs', 'sexily', 'hair', 'mouth', 'neck', 'can', 'tell', 'half', 'smile', 'just', 'talking', 'hot', 'air', 'really', 'forgive', 'trick', 'then', 'lets', 'make', 'love', 'song', 'few', 'seconds', 'sexily', 'kiss', 'so', 'sexy', 'yves', 'mm', 'are', 'so', 'beautfiful', 'together', 'most', 'handsome', 'ending', 'so', 'i', 'said', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'are', 'many', 'good', 'scenes', 'should', 'still', 'get', 'i', 'think', 'worth', 'buying', 'watching', 'especially', ""'re"", 'true', 'mm', 'fan']",Let's Make Love VHS

I feel bad about it because apparently this film was essentially a contractual obligation and Yves Montand doesn't even look right for her onscreen--I find it hard to picture the off-screen... oh, oh, well.Anyway, the action begins when the French billionaire Jean-Marc Clement (Yves Montand) finds out his life and playboy scandals are being publicly spoofed in an off-Broadway play. Upset about the possibility of negative press, Jean-Marc hurries down to the theater with his main PR man Alexander Coffman (Tony Randall). Naturally, he does find out he IS being made fun of--but his worries are sidetracked when he lays his eyes on Amanda Dell (Monroe), the female lead in the show.Jean-Marc and his associates set things up so that he can masquerade as an actor to be closer to Amanda; and as time goes by Jean-Marc forgets about his reputation being slandered. He only wants Amanda for his wife. Of course, the fact that Amanda is involved with another actor named Tony (Frankie Vaughan) doesn't help much.Look for some wonderful songs by Frankie Vaughan; and Marilyn at least scores one big one with her song and dance classic number, ""My Heart Belongs To Daddy."" It's not that she looks tired in this film; it's that she's grossly underused. That surprises me because George Cukor, the director, was particularly well known for bringing out the best acting from his leading ladies during production.After several silly plot twists, Jean-Marc realizes he's got to hire some professionals to help him get Amanda's attention. We therefore get some wonderful cameos by Milton Berle, Bing Crosby and Gene Kelly. They do a wonderful job although Milton Berle wasn't as funny as I hoped he would be.Of course, from here the plot can go anywhere. Will Jean-Marc ever disclose his true identity to Amanda--and how will she react when she knows he's been a faker all this time? How will Tony handle it if Amanda leaves him for Jean-Marc? Watch the movie and find out--I don't give plot spoilers!The DVD has a couple of interesting but very brief comparisons between what the film looked like pre-restoration and after restoration; but that's about it. Sigh.Overall, Let's Make Love is a tepid motion picture to be saved for when there's nothing good on television and you want to see a Marilyn Monroe movie. The acting is only fair; in fact Montand looks more weathered than Marilyn! It's a good movie; but nothing that you should go too far out of your way to see.

315367,A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS,6302484413,"Rama Rao ""Rama""","[1, 2]","Jean Marc-Clement (Yves Montand), a rich businessman discovers that he is going to be satirized in an off-Broadway theater, goes to see the crew and comes across Amanda Dell (Marilyn Monroe) and instantly smitten by her beauty and performing skills. With her pale blonde hair and younger looks, Marilyn Monroe is more beautiful in this movie than in other movies made in 1950's. The director of the show thinks that Jean Marc is an actor, and he reluctantly casts him as a member of the show. Montand with his heavy French accent tries hard to serenade Amanda by pretending that he is just a working actor named Alexander Dumas. Soon Jean Marc falls in love with Amanda, but gets stuck with false identity and unable to reveal his true identity.  It is tempting to suggest that this movie is a thinly-veiled portrait of billionaire William Randolph Hearst and actress Marion Davies. Hearst meets Davies during her performance in the movie ""Zeigfeld Follies"" of 1916 (silent movie), and falls in love with her.Many reviewers gave moderate rating after comparing this movie with Monroe's other successful performances in; ""Some Like It Hot,"" ""Seven year itch,"" ""How to marry a millionaire"" and ""Gentleman prefer blondes."" The truth is Monroe was frail in her personal life and had severe addiction to prescription drugs. She also had marital problems with her husband Arthur Miller and a brief affair with co-star Yves Montand that impacted her performance in this movie. The script also went through many revisions by writer Arthur Miller. Marilyn Monroe wanted the movie to focus on her and lift her career few more notches. Gregory Peck was offered the role of leading actor and he turns down the role knowing that this is too focused on Marilyn Monroe. Subsequently, the job was offered to Rock Hudson who also tuned it down. Eventually the role went to the Frenchman, Yves Montand.  George Cukor, one of the brilliant director's of Hollywood did his best to make this more interesting, but he had difficulty dealing with Marilyn Monroe. She was very temperamental on the set and frequently missed the film shooting schedule. Other cast members offered weak support; Yves Montand did not do an impressive job.  Frankie Vaughan, as the whining crooner, is no match for Monroe. Tony Randall as the assistant of Montand offers a fine performance with his usual cool comedy.This movie is known for some of the best music; Cole Porter's classic ""My Heart Belongs to Daddy,"" jazzy themes like; ""Let's Make Love"" and ""Incurably Romantic"" were also well staged and performed.  Marilyn sings and dances beautifully, and while singing ""Incurably Romantic,"" her dress flies up, almost like in ""The Seven-Year Itch."" The cameo appearances by Milton Berle, Bing Crosby and Gene Kelly, respectively as the comedy, music and dance instructor's of Montand are well thought of and some of the best comedy writing is found here.  Few interesting quotes are as follows:Jean-Marc Clement: Show me what I can do with a woman.Milton Berle: After what I've read about you, I'm sure that you could show me.Milton Berle: you know, between comedians and singers, women always go for singers.Bing Crosby: [moves his hand in a sweeping motion] Ya see; that's showmanship. Keeps her mind off your voiceGene Kelly: A dancer expresses with his body what an actor does with words. It's not just the feet.Amanda Dell: Charm him? I could murder him (in an angry voice).1.Captured on Film - The True Story of Marion Davies2.The Forever Marilyn Blu-ray Collection3.Marilyn the Premiere Collection4.Marilyn Monroe 10 Disc Collection: Monkey Business, Don't Bother to Knock, Niagara, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, How To Marry A Millionaire, There's No Business Like Show Business, River of No Return,Seven Year Itch, Bus Stop + Norma Jean & Marilyn",4,Great Romantic Comedy,1347408000,"09 12, 2012",2012,3809,"['Jean', 'Marc-Clement', 'Yves', 'Montand', 'rich', 'businessman', 'discovers', 'going', 'be', 'satirized', 'off-Broadway', 'theater', 'see', 'crew', 'Amanda', 'Dell', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'instantly', 'smitten', 'beauty', 'performing', 'skills', 'pale', 'blonde', 'hair', 'younger', 'looks', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'more', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'other', 'movies', 'made', '1950', 'director', 'show', 'Jean', 'Marc', 'actor', 'reluctantly', 'member', 'show', 'Montand', 'heavy', 'French', 'accent', 'tries', 'hard', 'serenade', 'Amanda', 'pretending', 'just', 'working', 'actor', 'named', 'Alexander', 'Dumas', 'Soon', 'Jean', 'Marc', 'love', 'Amanda', 'stuck', 'false', 'identity', 'unable', 'reveal', 'true', 'identity', 'tempting', 'suggest', 'movie', 'thinly-veiled', 'portrait', 'billionaire', 'William', 'Randolph', 'Hearst', 'actress', 'Marion', 'Davies', 'Hearst', 'Davies', 'performance', 'movie', 'Zeigfeld', 'Follies', '1916', 'silent', 'movie', 'love', 'her.Many', 'reviewers', 'gave', 'moderate', 'rating', 'comparing', 'movie', 'Monroe', 'other', 'successful', 'performances', 'Hot', 'Seven', 'year', 'itch', 'How', 'marry', 'millionaire', 'Gentleman', 'prefer', 'blondes', 'truth', 'Monroe', 'was', 'frail', 'personal', 'life', 'had', 'severe', 'addiction', 'prescription', 'drugs', 'also', 'had', 'marital', 'problems', 'husband', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'brief', 'affair', 'co-star', 'Yves', 'Montand', 'impacted', 'performance', 'movie', 'script', 'also', 'went', 'many', 'revisions', 'writer', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'wanted', 'movie', 'focus', 'lift', 'career', 'few', 'more', 'notches', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'was', 'offered', 'role', 'leading', 'actor', 'down', 'role', 'knowing', 'too', 'focused', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Subsequently', 'job', 'was', 'offered', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'who', 'also', 'tuned', 'down', 'Eventually', 'role', 'went', 'Frenchman', 'Montand', 'George', 'Cukor', 'one', 'brilliant', 'director', 'Hollywood', 'did', 'best', 'make', 'more', 'interesting', 'had', 'difficulty', 'dealing', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'was', 'very', 'temperamental', 'set', 'frequently', 'missed', 'film', 'shooting', 'schedule', 'Other', 'cast', 'members', 'offered', 'weak', 'support', 'Yves', 'Montand', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'impressive', 'job', 'Frankie', 'Vaughan', 'whining', 'crooner', 'match', 'Monroe', 'Tony', 'Randall', 'assistant', 'Montand', 'fine', 'performance', 'usual', 'cool', 'comedy.This', 'movie', 'known', 'best', 'music', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'classic', 'Heart', 'Belongs', 'Daddy', 'jazzy', 'themes', 'Let', 'Make', 'Love', 'Incurably', 'Romantic', 'were', 'also', 'well', 'staged', 'performed', 'Marilyn', 'sings', 'dances', 'beautifully', 'singing', 'Incurably', 'Romantic', 'dress', 'up', 'almost', 'Seven-Year', 'Itch', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'Milton', 'Berle', 'Bing', 'Crosby', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'respectively', 'comedy', 'music', 'dance', 'instructor', 'Montand', 'are', 'well', 'thought', 'best', 'comedy', 'writing', 'found', 'here', 'Few', 'interesting', 'quotes', 'are', 'Jean-Marc', 'Clement', 'Show', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'woman.Milton', 'Berle', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', ""'m"", 'sure', 'could', 'show', 'me.Milton', 'Berle', 'know', 'comedians', 'singers', 'women', 'always', 'go', 'singers.Bing', 'Crosby', '[', 'hand', 'sweeping', 'motion', ']', 'Ya', 'see', 'showmanship', 'mind', 'voiceGene', 'Kelly', 'dancer', 'body', 'what', 'actor', 'words', 'not', 'just', 'feet.Amanda', 'Dell', 'Charm', 'could', 'murder', 'angry', 'voice', '.1.Captured', 'Film', 'True', 'Story', 'Marion', 'Davies2.The', 'Forever', 'Marilyn', 'Blu-ray', 'Collection3.Marilyn', 'Premiere', 'Collection4.Marilyn', 'Monroe', '10', 'Disc', 'Collection', 'Monkey', 'Business', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Bother', 'Knock', 'Niagara', 'Gentlemen', 'Prefer', 'Blondes', 'How', 'Marry', 'A', 'Millionaire', 'Business', 'Show', 'Business', 'River', 'No', 'Return', 'Seven', 'Year', 'Itch', 'Bus', 'Stop', '+', 'Norma', 'Jean', 'Marilyn']",Let's Make Love VHS

Personally, I don't think I've ever seen Marilyn look sexier than she does with her romp through Cole Porter's ""My Heart Belongs to Daddy"", in that blue sweater and black stockings.  Yowza !!  And I like her with that little bit of extra weight !  But now, onto the movie.  It, quite frankly, stinks.  As other reviewers have noted, there is no on-screen chemistry between Yves Montand and Marilyn, which, also noted, is wierd for a couple that had a brief, off-screen affair.  The story itself of a French billionaire falling for an off-Broadway actress who apears in a musical that portrays him in an unflattering light...well, let's just say it's not very believable.  Marilyn seems to realize herself that the script itself is weak; it often seems like she is sleepwalking through her lines.  Tony Randall is completely wasted.  George Cukor's direction seems uncertain; it seems as though he and the rest of the crew walked away during those long, suffering, boring, close-up romantic conversations between Montand and MM that dominate the film because they realized the script stunk and there were no sparks on-screen whatsoever.  And that cinematography...it seems like every time they show Marilyn, someone smeared Vaseline on the lens to give her a sort of ""being in a fog"" look, even though her beauty does shine through.In the end, though, this is one of Marilyn's weakest films.  Good to know that she bounced back wonderfully in her next - and last - outing, John Huston's 'The Misfits'.

315370,A3GLF9XK4AUAHS,6302484413,Robert E. Nylund,"[10, 11]","When ""Let's Make Love"" was first released by Twentieth Century Fox in 1960, it was eagerly awaited because of the original teaming of superstar Marilyn Monroe with the French actor Yves Montand.  Directed by the legendary George Cukor, who certainly could handle musical comedies as his work on the 1954 ""A Star Is Born"" and the 1964 ""My Fair Lady"" demonstrates, there was every reason to believe this would be a very entertaining film.However, even in 1960, when the film seemed rather daring in many ways, it was just not quite as good as one had hoped.  Looking at it again, after many years, this writer had hopes that there might be something I missed when I first saw it.  Sadly, the film misfires on a number of things.  The magic between Monroe and Montand is just not there, and that's remarkable because we all heard about their offscreen love affair (which Montand's wife, actress Simone Signoret, tolerated, believing it would quickly end as it actually did).  Nevertheless, one can see glimpses of the talents of both stars and I still remain impressed with Montand's very capable dancing and his competent singing.Marilyn seldom looked as beautiful and sexy as she did in this film.  Her costumes were quite sensational in 1960.  Her hair had been changed to the popular bouffant style of the time.  Her best singing in the film is in an updated version of the Cole Porter classic, ""My Heart Belongs To Daddy.""  Her voice, however, had become increasingly husky and it often made it hard to understand the lyrics of the songs written for the movie, including the title song.In the story, Montand's character is aided by Milton Berle, Bing Crosby, and Gene Kelly, in rather delightful cameos.  They try to help him with his comedy, his singing, and his dancing and, typical of Hollywood magic, he does succeed in impressing Monroe's character, who is so taken with singer Frankie Vaughan.  However, it is still difficult to believe that she would actually drop Vaughan for Montand, despite learning the truth that he really IS a billionaire.  By the way, I was quite impressed with Vaughan's smooth, sophisticated singing.Almost lost in the shuffle with the wonderful Tony Randall, who did so well in dealing with another Fox sexpot, Jayne Mansfield, in ""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter.""  Randall turned in one of his typically delightful performances, as he tried to help Montand in his efforts to attract Monroe.This film proved to be the last production that Marilyn Monroe completed for Twentieth Century Fox, where she had made most of her films.  It was followed by the intriguing drama ""The Misfits,"" directed by John Huston, the only time she worked with Clark Gable (in his very last film), and another musical comedy at Fox, ""Something's Gotta Give,"" also directed by Cukor.  It has been well-documented how Monroe's increasing dependency on prescription drugs interferred with her work and led Fox to fire her, only to reconsider it just before she died in early August 1962, at the age of 36.",3,Marilyn's Last Musical,1153353600,"07 20, 2006",2006,3017,"['When', 'Let', 'Make', 'Love', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Fox', '1960', 'was', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'original', 'teaming', 'superstar', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'French', 'actor', 'Yves', 'Montand', 'Directed', 'legendary', 'George', 'Cukor', 'who', 'certainly', 'could', 'handle', 'musical', 'comedies', 'work', '1954', 'Star', 'Born', '1964', 'Fair', 'Lady', 'was', 'reason', 'believe', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film.However', 'even', '1960', 'when', 'film', 'seemed', 'rather', 'daring', 'many', 'ways', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'had', 'hoped', 'Looking', 'again', 'many', 'years', 'writer', 'had', 'hopes', 'might', 'be', 'something', 'missed', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'Sadly', 'film', 'misfires', 'number', 'things', 'magic', 'Monroe', 'Montand', 'just', 'not', 'there', 'remarkable', 'heard', 'offscreen', 'love', 'affair', 'Montand', 'wife', 'actress', 'Simone', 'Signoret', 'tolerated', 'believing', 'would', 'quickly', 'end', 'actually', 'did', 'Nevertheless', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'glimpses', 'talents', 'stars', 'still', 'remain', 'impressed', 'Montand', 'very', 'capable', 'dancing', 'competent', 'singing.Marilyn', 'seldom', 'looked', 'beautiful', 'sexy', 'did', 'film', 'costumes', 'were', 'quite', 'sensational', '1960', 'hair', 'had', 'been', 'changed', 'popular', 'bouffant', 'style', 'time', 'best', 'singing', 'film', 'updated', 'version', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'classic', 'Heart', 'Belongs', 'Daddy', 'voice', 'however', 'had', 'become', 'increasingly', 'husky', 'often', 'made', 'hard', 'understand', 'lyrics', 'songs', 'written', 'movie', 'including', 'title', 'song.In', 'story', 'Montand', 'character', 'aided', 'Milton', 'Berle', 'Bing', 'Crosby', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'rather', 'delightful', 'cameos', 'try', 'help', 'comedy', 'singing', 'dancing', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'magic', 'succeed', 'impressing', 'Monroe', 'character', 'who', 'so', 'taken', 'singer', 'Frankie', 'Vaughan', 'However', 'still', 'difficult', 'believe', 'would', 'actually', 'drop', 'Vaughan', 'Montand', 'learning', 'truth', 'really', 'billionaire', 'way', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'Vaughan', 'smooth', 'sophisticated', 'singing.Almost', 'lost', 'shuffle', 'wonderful', 'Tony', 'Randall', 'who', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'dealing', 'Fox', 'sexpot', 'Jayne', 'Mansfield', 'Will', 'Success', 'Spoil', 'Rock', 'Hunter', 'Randall', 'turned', 'one', 'typically', 'delightful', 'performances', 'tried', 'help', 'Montand', 'efforts', 'attract', 'Monroe.This', 'film', 'proved', 'be', 'last', 'production', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'completed', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Fox', 'where', 'had', 'made', 'most', 'films', 'was', 'followed', 'intriguing', 'drama', 'Misfits', 'directed', 'John', 'Huston', 'only', 'time', 'worked', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'very', 'last', 'film', 'musical', 'comedy', 'Fox', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'also', 'directed', 'Cukor', 'been', 'well-documented', 'how', 'Monroe', 'increasing', 'dependency', 'prescription', 'drugs', 'interferred', 'work', 'led', 'Fox', 'fire', 'only', 'reconsider', 'just', 'died', 'early', 'August', '1962', 'age', '36']",Let's Make Love VHS
315371,A14ADG0TTI4XBV,6302484413,"Scott Coblio ""kookoo guy""","[1, 1]","For a Marilyn Monroe film, ""Let's Make Love"" is strangely devoid of any close-ups of its star. Although she is attractive as ever, (although a little pastier and plumper than usual), George Cukor's camera seems afraid somehow to get close to her, and she appears only in wide and medium shots throughout. This proves exasperating, especially since the plot is wafer-thin and the film offers little else of interest besides Monroe. The musical numbers are flat and lightyears away from ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"" or even the songs Sugar Kane sings in ""Some Like It Hot'. There is something lifeless about this movie and the camera seems to have fallen momentarily out of love with her. Monroe herself seems equally disenchanted, and there is something tired and lackluster about her presence here--her characteristic vitality is absent. Perhaps her offscreen troubles (insomnia, etc) were beginning to encroach on her performances (although she certainly gained back all her vibrancy and more in the never-finished ""Something's Got To Give"" three years later).That said, ""Let's Make Love"" is not entirely a failure. The plot, which is a kind of twist on ""The Prince and Pauper"" (girl mistakes billionaire for his own poor look-alike and he goes along with it to win her heart--will he be found out before the plan can work?) is mildly entertaining, and Monroe--even at her worst--is always compelling, even from the great distances imposed here by the camerawork.  The film does seem overlong with too many (mediocre) production numbers, the exception of course being ""My Heart Belongs to Daddy', although I'd still take Lorelei Lee any day.Marilyn's persona here is in transition from the baby-voiced cupie she minted in her earlier characterizations to the Actor's Studio method actress she was trying to become (and the complicated person she ultimately was, which had begun to inhabit her characterizations starting with ""Bus Stop"" and ""The Prince and the Showgirl""). Her voice is a little more natural  than the one she is remembered for, and it's nice to see her beginning to ""grow up"". It's just too bad the material was so average and that the camera films her with no more regard than it does the background set.The film's title is ironic since its two stars had an extra-marital affair while filming it (Monroe was married to Arthur Miller at the time, Montand to actress Simone Signoret). This ended badly, and perhaps contributes to Monroe's problematic performance here. For his part, Montand seem a slightly ill-fit for such a beatnik-style musical (Monroe too for that matter. She is just a little too old--and too quintessentially 1950's-- to comfortably pull off the  doo-be-dooby-do wop"" jazzy numbers).  It's too bad that ""Something's Got to Give"" was never finished, as surviving footage from that film proves Marilyn was finding a more age-appropriate image that would have worked for her in the 60's.Interesting as a curiosity piece, but to my mind not the kind of movie you'll want to watch over and over. Even ""The Misfits"" has more rewatchability than this film. If you crave latter-day Marilyn, stick with ""Some Like it Hot, ""Bus Stop"", and ""Prince and the Showgirl"", any of which reveals a more complex actress at work, to much greater effect.",3,Why No Close-Ups?,1371686400,"06 20, 2013",2013,3278,"['Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'film', 'Let', 'Make', 'Love', 'strangely', 'devoid', 'close-ups', 'star', 'attractive', 'ever', 'little', 'pastier', 'plumper', 'usual', 'George', 'Cukor', 'camera', 'afraid', 'somehow', 'get', 'close', 'only', 'wide', 'medium', 'shots', 'exasperating', 'especially', 'plot', 'wafer-thin', 'film', 'little', 'else', 'interest', 'Monroe', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'flat', 'away', 'Diamonds', 'Are', 'Girl', 'Best', 'Friend', 'even', 'songs', 'Sugar', 'Kane', 'sings', 'Hot', 'something', 'lifeless', 'movie', 'camera', 'have', 'fallen', 'momentarily', 'love', 'Monroe', 'equally', 'disenchanted', 'something', 'tired', 'lackluster', 'presence', 'here', 'characteristic', 'vitality', 'absent', 'Perhaps', 'offscreen', 'troubles', 'insomnia', 'etc', 'were', 'beginning', 'encroach', 'performances', 'certainly', 'gained', 'back', 'vibrancy', 'more', 'never-finished', 'Something', 'Got', 'Give', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'said', 'Let', 'Make', 'Love', 'not', 'entirely', 'failure', 'plot', 'kind', 'twist', 'Prince', 'Pauper', 'girl', 'mistakes', 'billionaire', 'own', 'poor', 'look-alike', 'along', 'win', 'heart', 'will', 'be', 'found', 'out', 'plan', 'can', 'work', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'Monroe', 'even', 'worst', 'always', 'compelling', 'even', 'great', 'distances', 'imposed', 'here', 'camerawork', 'film', 'seem', 'overlong', 'too', 'many', 'mediocre', 'production', 'numbers', 'exception', 'course', 'being', 'Heart', 'Belongs', 'Daddy', ""'d"", 'still', 'take', 'Lorelei', 'Lee', 'day.Marilyn', 'persona', 'here', 'transition', 'baby-voiced', 'cupie', 'minted', 'earlier', 'characterizations', 'Actor', 'Studio', 'method', 'actress', 'was', 'trying', 'become', 'complicated', 'person', 'ultimately', 'was', 'had', 'begun', 'inhabit', 'characterizations', 'starting', 'Bus', 'Stop', 'Prince', 'Showgirl', 'voice', 'little', 'more', 'natural', 'one', 'remembered', 'nice', 'see', 'beginning', 'grow', 'up', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'material', 'was', 'so', 'average', 'camera', 'more', 'regard', 'background', 'set.The', 'film', 'title', 'ironic', 'two', 'stars', 'had', 'extra-marital', 'affair', 'filming', 'Monroe', 'was', 'married', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'time', 'Montand', 'actress', 'Simone', 'Signoret', 'ended', 'badly', 'perhaps', 'contributes', 'Monroe', 'problematic', 'performance', 'here', 'part', 'Montand', 'seem', 'slightly', 'ill-fit', 'such', 'beatnik-style', 'musical', 'Monroe', 'too', 'matter', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'old', 'too', 'quintessentially', '1950', 'comfortably', 'pull', 'off', 'doo-be-dooby-do', 'wop', 'jazzy', 'numbers', 'too', 'bad', 'Something', 'Got', 'Give', 'was', 'never', 'finished', 'surviving', 'footage', 'film', 'Marilyn', 'was', 'finding', 'more', 'age-appropriate', 'image', 'would', 'have', 'worked', ""60's.Interesting"", 'curiosity', 'piece', 'mind', 'not', 'kind', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'Even', 'Misfits', 'more', 'rewatchability', 'film', 'crave', 'latter-day', 'Marilyn', 'stick', 'Hot', 'Bus', 'Stop', 'Prince', 'Showgirl', 'more', 'complex', 'actress', 'work', 'much', 'greater', 'effect']",Let's Make Love VHS
315372,A2ZRC8P3MBIQL3,6302484413,"TUCO H. ""H. TUCO""","[6, 6]","The fantastic musical numbers alone make this movie worth watching at least a hundred times and Monroe's being in them is 90% of the reason why. Frankie Vaughn is great in all his musical numbers with Marilyn and Montand did an amazing job in his first English role, shifting smoothly between scenes with a more serious tone and ridiculous comic scenes. And 'Lack of Chemistry' between Montand and Monroe? Not so. You can very much feel the connection between them but it's a deeper chemistry born out of a true appreciation of each other's artistry rather than the common surface chemistry. This deeper transcending connection of the real people acting the parts is there for all who can pay close attention veiled behind what the parts themselves call for which is 'lack of chemstry' between them and Montand's silly attempts to impress her and create a connection. We slowly watch the surface-movie-parts chemistry and the sexual tension develop while the movie gets most of its laughs from making Montand look ridiculous--at the same time the deeper underlying chemistry being always at work whenever they share the screen.Monroe was in more or as many scenes here as in ""Some Like It Hot"" and ""Seven Year Itch.""  Whether Monroe initially hated the part she was given to do by Fox under contract--or not, is a moot point since it does not show through one bit in the role. She rises above any misgivings to deliver maybe her best performance after ""Bus Stop,""  her most fully realistic, reality based comic role, a further demonstration of the remarkable acting talent that was struggling to be recognized amidst all the sex-symbol hoopla. In all the non-musical scenes, she refuses to play the dumb blonde caricature and instead plays a real woman, close to what she was like in real life, one whose intelligence and wit shows through and all the comic nuances she adds are firmly rooted in and arise from that base and not some two-dimensional cliche. She's been through a lot by this point and has acquired quite a bit of 'soul' and taps into it regularly without over-playing that angle and overpowering the light comic tone of the film.The writing has plenty of wit to spare for every scene and the directing is expert and very detailed. One of the best scenes in the movie doesn't even involve any of the principal leads and features a hilarious attempt by the nearly bankrupt theatre manager to bluff his way into a better bargaining position against Montand's secret representative who is ready to pay his debts for a share of the business. I also love how they absurdly stretch the ending out with Montand saying repeatedly that he's Clement and Monroe refusing to believe it even all the way up to his office and in front of his secretaries because she thinks that his obsessive dedication to acting the part of Clement has driven him so much into the character that he's stuck in it and can't escape! Just the fact that they even conceived of and wrote a scene like that and Cukor got Montand and Monroe to subtly act it to perfection makes this movie unique and special among the comedy/musicals.The DVD transfer is excellent but there are no special features other than a couple of trailers.",5,"Monroe's best acting job along with ""Bus Stop.""",1208908800,"04 23, 2008",2008,3208,"['fantastic', 'musical', 'numbers', 'alone', 'make', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'least', 'hundred', 'times', 'Monroe', 'being', '90', '%', 'reason', 'why', 'Frankie', 'Vaughn', 'great', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Marilyn', 'Montand', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'first', 'English', 'role', 'shifting', 'smoothly', 'scenes', 'more', 'serious', 'tone', 'ridiculous', 'comic', 'scenes', ""'Lack"", 'Chemistry', 'Montand', 'Monroe', 'Not', 'so', 'can', 'very', 'much', 'feel', 'connection', 'deeper', 'chemistry', 'born', 'true', 'appreciation', 'other', 'artistry', 'rather', 'common', 'surface', 'chemistry', 'deeper', 'transcending', 'connection', 'real', 'people', 'acting', 'parts', 'there', 'who', 'can', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'veiled', 'what', 'parts', 'call', ""'lack"", 'chemstry', 'Montand', 'silly', 'attempts', 'impress', 'create', 'connection', 'slowly', 'watch', 'surface-movie-parts', 'chemistry', 'sexual', 'tension', 'develop', 'movie', 'most', 'laughs', 'making', 'Montand', 'look', 'ridiculous', 'same', 'time', 'deeper', 'underlying', 'chemistry', 'being', 'always', 'work', 'whenever', 'share', 'screen.Monroe', 'was', 'more', 'many', 'scenes', 'here', 'Hot', 'Seven', 'Year', 'Itch', 'Whether', 'Monroe', 'initially', 'hated', 'part', 'was', 'given', 'do', 'Fox', 'contract', 'not', 'moot', 'point', 'not', 'show', 'one', 'bit', 'role', 'misgivings', 'deliver', 'maybe', 'best', 'performance', 'Bus', 'Stop', 'most', 'fully', 'realistic', 'reality', 'based', 'comic', 'role', 'further', 'demonstration', 'remarkable', 'acting', 'talent', 'was', 'struggling', 'be', 'recognized', 'sex-symbol', 'hoopla', 'non-musical', 'scenes', 'play', 'dumb', 'blonde', 'caricature', 'instead', 'real', 'woman', 'close', 'what', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'one', 'intelligence', 'wit', 'shows', 'comic', 'nuances', 'are', 'firmly', 'rooted', 'arise', 'base', 'not', 'two-dimensional', 'cliche', 'been', 'lot', 'point', 'acquired', 'quite', 'bit', ""'soul"", 'taps', 'regularly', 'over-playing', 'angle', 'overpowering', 'light', 'comic', 'tone', 'film.The', 'writing', 'plenty', 'wit', 'spare', 'scene', 'directing', 'expert', 'very', 'detailed', 'One', 'best', 'scenes', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'involve', 'principal', 'leads', 'hilarious', 'attempt', 'nearly', 'bankrupt', 'theatre', 'manager', 'bluff', 'way', 'better', 'bargaining', 'position', 'Montand', 'secret', 'representative', 'who', 'ready', 'pay', 'debts', 'share', 'business', 'also', 'love', 'how', 'absurdly', 'stretch', 'ending', 'out', 'Montand', 'saying', 'repeatedly', 'Clement', 'Monroe', 'refusing', 'believe', 'even', 'way', 'office', 'front', 'secretaries', 'obsessive', 'dedication', 'acting', 'part', 'Clement', 'driven', 'so', 'much', 'character', 'stuck', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'Just', 'fact', 'even', 'conceived', 'wrote', 'scene', 'Cukor', 'got', 'Montand', 'Monroe', 'subtly', 'act', 'perfection', 'movie', 'unique', 'special', 'comedy/musicals.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'excellent', 'are', 'special', 'other', 'couple', 'trailers']",Let's Make Love VHS
