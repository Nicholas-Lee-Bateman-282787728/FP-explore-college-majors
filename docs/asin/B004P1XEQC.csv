I don't say that the sex isn't ""improved"" but she was definitely part of Messala's life.Third, the element of forgiveness and love (not sex) is made much more important in this movie than in the 1959 movie.  The Christian message of redemption is slighted, to be sure, and that should have been rectified, although frankly the 1959 version made the healing of mother and daughter a little too Hollywood Religious (which isn't the same as truly religious.)Fourth, I think I need to point out to other reviewers and to the makers of this version (who misspeak in the ""making of"" that was shown on TV): The 1959 is not ""the original movie.""  That was back several years earlier and starred Ramon Novarro as Ben Hur.  (It's available on Amazon.)  It is every bit as exciting as a silent movie can get; don't let your biases make you think it isn't.The acting here is quite good.  Joseph Morgan is a much more believably young Judah Ben Hur. As good as Heston was, he tended to chew rocks more than Mr. Morgan, and, however genuine Heston's intentions were, they do cloy at times.The rest of the cast are equal to their roles or more, and the CGI elements helped make this version almost as spectacular in ways as the great MGM spectacular of 1959.",5,Elements from Lew Wallace added,1365292800,"04 7, 2013",2013,1500,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'really', 'liked', 'new', 'version', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'lengthy', 'commercial', 'interruptions.Second', 'character', 'whore', 'remember', 'correctly', 'reading', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'years', 'ago', 'absolutely', 'Lew', 'Wallace', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'sex', ""n't"", 'improved', 'was', 'definitely', 'part', 'Messala', 'life.Third', 'element', 'forgiveness', 'love', 'not', 'sex', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'important', 'movie', '1959', 'movie', 'Christian', 'message', 'redemption', 'slighted', 'be', 'sure', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'rectified', 'frankly', '1959', 'version', 'made', 'healing', 'mother', 'daughter', 'little', 'too', 'Hollywood', 'Religious', ""n't"", 'same', 'truly', 'religious', 'Fourth', 'think', 'need', 'point', 'out', 'other', 'reviewers', 'makers', 'version', 'who', 'misspeak', 'making', 'was', 'shown', 'TV', '1959', 'not', 'original', 'movie', 'was', 'back', 'several', 'years', 'earlier', 'starred', 'Ramon', 'Novarro', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'available', 'Amazon', 'bit', 'as', 'exciting', 'silent', 'movie', 'can', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'biases', 'make', 'think', 'acting', 'here', 'quite', 'good', 'Joseph', 'Morgan', 'much', 'more', 'believably', 'young', 'Judah', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'As', 'good', 'Heston', 'was', 'tended', 'chew', 'rocks', 'more', 'Mr.', 'Morgan', 'however', 'genuine', 'Heston', 'intentions', 'were', 'do', 'cloy', 'times.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'equal', 'roles', 'more', 'CGI', 'elements', 'helped', 'make', 'version', 'almost', 'spectacular', 'ways', 'great', 'MGM', 'spectacular', '1959']",Ben Hur

Still, ""Ben Hur"" without the Christ seems very strange indeed. OK, Jesus isn't entirely absent from the story, but he plays a much less central role than he should (except for 10 minutes at the very end). Instead, Judah Ben Hur seems more interested in harlots. And I don't mean Mary Magdalene, LOL. Some of the actors are superb, others feel bland, and the story doesn't grip the viewer as the movie with Charlton Heston did.

1423176,AB34G6VKP28L,B004P1XEQC,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[24, 26]","It is difficult to compete with the big-screen blockbuster that has become a classic, but that is precisely what this British-Canadian miniseries attempts to do -- approach a famous story from a new and exciting modern perspective. In many ways it succeeds, and in others it fails.As children, Judah Ben Hur and Messala are the best of friends, spending their time pretending to chariot race with the work horses and shooing Judah's younger sister Tizrah away from them. Then the fateful day comes when Mesalla's important father in Rome sends for him, and the illegitimate son must leave his adopted family behind. Many years later, Judah (Joseph Morgan) has grown into a man and at the bidding of his mother Ruth (Alex Kingston), agrees to become engaged to the beautiful Esther (Emily VanCamp). Their slow fondness for one another is beginning to bud when news arrives that Messala (Stephen Campbell Moore) has returned and requested an audience. He is not the man Judah remembers... cold and ambitious, with a mind more inclined toward the lax morality and power-hungry ideals of Rome, he has been assigned to protect the arrival of Pontius Pilate (Hugh Bonneville) to Jerusalem. There are concerns of an impending uprising and a plot against the new governor's life.His demand that Judah inform him if he hears of any such plots of insurgency upset Tizrah (Kristen Kreuk) and threaten to drive a wedge between them. And when a horrific accident nearly ends the life of Pilate as he enters Jerusalem, the lives of the Ben Hur family will never be the same -- leading Judah on a journey of self-discovery, vengeance, and redemption that in some ways is glorious and in others woefully lacks the religious drive of the original. I have incredibly mixed feelings about this miniseries because in many ways it is glorious and vastly improves on the better-known film -- it has much better dialogue, far better characterization, and makes better use of its time. The character development is improved, lesser figures are fleshed out more, and there is an even more apparent sense of urgency beneath it, as Judah desperately tries to avenge his family. The costume design is luxurious and it really makes you feel as if you are walking the streets of Rome or peering through windows in Jerusalem. We also get a much more empathetic and tragic view of Messala.Unfortunately, along with these improvements come a hearty dose of content that make it inappropriate for family viewing -- and the gradual realization that Christianity has been stripped as much as possible from the story, so watered down that it leaves the inevitable conclusion feeling somewhat pale. There is no mention of Judah's mother or sister having heard of Jesus or desiring to ask for Him to heal them, and although Esther is a follower, she never mentions Him or His influence in her life. Judah has two encounters with Christ and both are important, but not to such an extent that if you were unaware of the storyline you would comprehend how much this changes him. In addition to this, a Greek whore is introduced and becomes sexually involved with Judah while he is in Rome and later when he returns to his home in Jerusalem. There is one explicit, lengthy sex scene between them, with movement and nudity; we later see her breasts again as she tries to entice him into bed.The cast is quite good, particularly in the lesser roles where a number of talented actors find their footing as Romans. Though they play Pilate as a bit of an oaf at the start I quite liked him at the end, in part thanks to the actor's dedication. I also enjoyed seeing Kristen Kreuk in a more serious role, but alas, both she and Alex Kingston are under-used. And in spite of my disappointment in the usage of the role of the whore, I found her to be a really interesting character. There are some beautiful scenes and patches of dialogue that express the story quite well, including the great battle at sea, but I also feel compelled to mention that the film takes historical liberties and is never completely accurate in its depiction of Jewish rituals and laws. (Lepers are seen wandering the streets, interacting with people!) I wish they had left out the problematic elements and added a bit more of the salvation aspect of the original novel, because from a a non-biased viewpoint, this would have become the definitive version for me.",3,Watered Down Plot Plus Sex,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,4390,"['difficult', 'compete', 'big-screen', 'blockbuster', 'become', 'classic', 'precisely', 'what', 'British-Canadian', 'miniseries', 'attempts', 'do', 'approach', 'famous', 'story', 'new', 'exciting', 'modern', 'perspective', 'many', 'ways', 'others', 'children', 'Judah', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'Messala', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'spending', 'time', 'pretending', 'chariot', 'race', 'work', 'horses', 'shooing', 'Judah', 'younger', 'sister', 'Tizrah', 'away', 'Then', 'fateful', 'day', 'when', 'Mesalla', 'important', 'father', 'Rome', 'sends', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'must', 'leave', 'adopted', 'family', 'Many', 'years', 'later', 'Judah', 'Joseph', 'Morgan', 'grown', 'man', 'bidding', 'mother', 'Ruth', 'Alex', 'Kingston', 'become', 'engaged', 'beautiful', 'Esther', 'Emily', 'VanCamp', 'slow', 'fondness', 'one', 'beginning', 'bud', 'when', 'news', 'Messala', 'Stephen', 'Campbell', 'Moore', 'returned', 'requested', 'audience', 'not', 'man', 'Judah', 'remembers', 'cold', 'ambitious', 'mind', 'more', 'inclined', 'lax', 'morality', 'power-hungry', 'ideals', 'Rome', 'been', 'assigned', 'protect', 'arrival', 'Pontius', 'Pilate', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'Jerusalem', 'are', 'concerns', 'impending', 'uprising', 'plot', 'new', 'governor', 'life.His', 'demand', 'Judah', 'inform', 'such', 'plots', 'insurgency', 'upset', 'Tizrah', 'Kristen', 'Kreuk', 'threaten', 'drive', 'wedge', 'when', 'horrific', 'accident', 'nearly', 'life', 'Pilate', 'Jerusalem', 'lives', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'family', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'leading', 'Judah', 'journey', 'self-discovery', 'vengeance', 'redemption', 'ways', 'glorious', 'others', 'woefully', 'religious', 'drive', 'original', 'have', 'incredibly', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'miniseries', 'many', 'ways', 'glorious', 'vastly', 'better-known', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'dialogue', 'far', 'better', 'characterization', 'better', 'use', 'time', 'character', 'development', 'improved', 'lesser', 'figures', 'are', 'fleshed', 'more', 'even', 'more', 'apparent', 'sense', 'urgency', 'beneath', 'Judah', 'desperately', 'avenge', 'family', 'costume', 'design', 'luxurious', 'really', 'feel', 'are', 'walking', 'streets', 'Rome', 'peering', 'windows', 'Jerusalem', 'also', 'get', 'much', 'more', 'empathetic', 'tragic', 'view', 'Messala.Unfortunately', 'improvements', 'come', 'hearty', 'dose', 'content', 'make', 'inappropriate', 'family', 'viewing', 'gradual', 'realization', 'Christianity', 'been', 'stripped', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'story', 'so', 'watered', 'down', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'feeling', 'somewhat', 'pale', 'mention', 'Judah', 'mother', 'sister', 'having', 'heard', 'Jesus', 'desiring', 'ask', 'Him', 'heal', 'Esther', 'follower', 'never', 'Him', 'influence', 'life', 'Judah', 'two', 'encounters', 'Christ', 'are', 'important', 'not', 'such', 'extent', 'were', 'unaware', 'storyline', 'would', 'comprehend', 'how', 'much', 'addition', 'Greek', 'whore', 'introduced', 'sexually', 'involved', 'Judah', 'Rome', 'later', 'when', 'home', 'Jerusalem', 'one', 'explicit', 'lengthy', 'sex', 'scene', 'movement', 'nudity', 'later', 'see', 'breasts', 'again', 'entice', 'bed.The', 'cast', 'quite', 'good', 'particularly', 'lesser', 'where', 'number', 'talented', 'actors', 'find', 'footing', 'Romans', 'play', 'Pilate', 'bit', 'oaf', 'start', 'quite', 'liked', 'end', 'part', 'thanks', 'actor', 'dedication', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'Kristen', 'Kreuk', 'more', 'serious', 'role', 'alas', 'Alex', 'Kingston', 'are', 'under-used', 'spite', 'disappointment', 'usage', 'role', 'whore', 'found', 'be', 'really', 'interesting', 'character', 'are', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'patches', 'dialogue', 'story', 'quite', 'well', 'including', 'great', 'battle', 'sea', 'also', 'feel', 'compelled', 'mention', 'film', 'historical', 'liberties', 'never', 'completely', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'Jewish', 'rituals', 'laws', 'Lepers', 'are', 'seen', 'wandering', 'streets', 'interacting', 'people', 'wish', 'had', 'left', 'out', 'problematic', 'elements', 'added', 'bit', 'more', 'salvation', 'aspect', 'original', 'novel', 'non-biased', 'viewpoint', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'definitive', 'version']",Ben Hur

1423178,A2GPN2VKS8E77C,B004P1XEQC,HAMLET,"[0, 0]","Note: I saw this miniseries via XFinity On Demand.CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!I was hesitant when I read about this miniseries three years ago, and I thought, ""WHY?""  Now having seen it via On Demand, Part i last week and Part 2 less than four hours ago, I'm still asking myself the same question. It's nowhere near as good as the 1925 & 1959 versions. To its credit, there are some historical allusions made, and correct ones too. For instance, Pontius Pilate's cruelty to the Jews is referenced a few times, the Emperor Tiberius Caesar laments that he was never handsome and the guests at the masque wear Greek masks. And the acting ranges from mediocre (Joseph Morgan) to excellent (Emily VanCamp [doing a perfect British accent], Stephen Campbell Moore [who resembles Christian Bale, the real cinematic Batman, in my opnion], James Faulkner and Lucia Jimenez. Hence, the three stars. Sadly, Alex Kingston & Kristen Kreuk were underused. And the Christian aspect was very very very underplayed here. I did like Esther telling Judah about Jesus, though. That counteracts a claim from a reviewer here who said that we never heard about Jesus' influence on her. And Jesus is never even mentioned by Name, merely as the Nazarene. Why is that? The sea battle was very very very poorly done. The scenery was compute-generated. And how does Quintus Arrius commit suicide exactly? What is a 'Pink bath'? What made Arrius kill himself? The Emperor's displeasure? And in the several shots of Messala prior to his final scene after being severely wounded in the chariot racve, which looked more like an amateur race than anything opulent that the Romans would have done, it looked like Messala's left arm had been amputated. And the names of Judah's parents have been inexplicably changed from their names in the novel. Messala's fate here is also drastically altered from his fate in the novel and in the 1925 & 1959 motion pictures.A viewer here also said that there's nudity in this miniseries. The only nudity seen is a shot of Judah as he's cleaning himself after a practice fight.See this miniseries once, and stick with the 1925 & 1959 versions. They are much better.Not Rated (brief male rear nudity).EDIT - 4/10/13I came across the miniseries on YouTube a few hours after I wrote this review, and it contains scenes cut from the film for On Demand, though I don't know why, and there is female nudity.

1423180,A4EFCH8II6U3P,B004P1XEQC,Medraut,"[1, 2]","First it should be noted this is a mini series. so it may not have as lavish a set as a big commercial movie. nither is it a remake of the Heston movie, rather a different version of the same story. I invite viewers to give this minseries a chance. it is well done, both in terms of actors, sets, and performance. it is an excellent drama. i highly enjoyed this production and would recomand it.some claim this version is more watered down. that some elements have been stripped of the story. some claim that wallace would not approve. first off let me state that Wallace himself stated that, ""the Christian world would not tolerate a novel with Jesus Christ its hero and I knew it. he should not be present as an actor in any scene of my creation. the giving of a cup of water to Ben-hur at the well near Nazareth is the only violation of this rule.""  Although the title of the book is called 'a tale of Christ' the fact is that Ben-hur's story is meant to parallel Jesus'. while in Heston's version there is much more prominant role while here it is reduced. he still gives the cup, he still preaches upon the mound, and so forth. there are still the elements of the christian religion within this story. have the creator's toned that down? perhaps, but this is not 'hollywood striping religon from a story' as some claim. rather the creators being opened minded to all viewers. christian, jewish, or otherwise. that is not such a harmful thing nor does it detract from the main purpose of the story. some state that this story focuses too much on vengance. i remind them that Wallece's insperation was the Count of Monte Cristo. itself a different story of emperor's, vengance, and so forth. some claim this is not a family movie. that sex has been added into the story. the sexulism is minimal at best. i would also remind the viewer that this production is tame compared to some of the acts written within the bible. both new and old testement.religion is a touchy subject in these our modern times. some are very sensative about it. perhaps this is why the creators of this production 'watered things down' if they did at all. sociaty has become so touchy about the subject that even in my statements of this review may come under attack. i would rather avoid such debates and say that relgion should be a more personal matter.that said. this production itself interests me. it still tells the main story. which is the struggle between the Roman Empire and it's rebellious conquest of Judea. how two good friends are caught up in events and their lives are forever changed by them. it is the story of Ben Hur. his life, his strugggles and his interaction in both the Roman and Jewish world. it is the tale of how Jerusleam resisted the conquest of Rome, but was utlimatly dominated by it and would never be the same again. it is also the story of Ben Hur's betayal, thirst for vengance, and the actions that he takes. the changes he makes and their results. in this i think it achives it's goals.i have not read the book, so i dont know how much it is like it. but then is any movie/series like its book? if one wants the book then read it. for the present state of affairs i would say that this is a pleasing production well worth the attention.as to other matters. well i would say that every viewer can take or insert their own views into it.",4,A New Ben Hur,1350777600,"10 21, 2012",2012,3351,"['First', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'mini', 'series', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'lavish', 'set', 'big', 'commercial', 'movie', 'remake', 'Heston', 'movie', 'rather', 'different', 'version', 'same', 'story', 'invite', 'viewers', 'give', 'chance', 'well', 'done', 'terms', 'actors', 'sets', 'performance', 'excellent', 'drama', 'i', 'highly', 'enjoyed', 'production', 'would', 'recomand', 'it.some', 'claim', 'version', 'more', 'watered', 'down', 'elements', 'have', 'been', 'stripped', 'story', 'claim', 'wallace', 'would', 'not', 'approve', 'first', 'let', 'state', 'Wallace', 'stated', 'Christian', 'world', 'would', 'not', 'tolerate', 'novel', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'hero', 'knew', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'present', 'actor', 'scene', 'creation', 'giving', 'cup', 'water', 'Ben-hur', 'well', 'Nazareth', 'only', 'violation', 'rule', 'title', 'book', 'called', 'tale', 'Christ', 'fact', 'Ben-hur', 'story', 'meant', 'parallel', 'Jesus', 'Heston', 'version', 'much', 'more', 'prominant', 'role', 'here', 'reduced', 'still', 'cup', 'still', 'mound', 'so', 'forth', 'are', 'still', 'elements', 'christian', 'religion', 'story', 'have', 'creator', 'toned', 'down', 'perhaps', 'not', ""'hollywood"", 'striping', 'religon', 'story', 'claim', 'rather', 'creators', 'being', 'opened', 'minded', 'viewers', 'christian', 'jewish', 'otherwise', 'not', 'such', 'harmful', 'thing', 'detract', 'main', 'purpose', 'story', 'state', 'story', 'too', 'much', 'vengance', 'i', 'remind', 'Wallece', 'insperation', 'was', 'Count', 'Monte', 'Cristo', 'different', 'story', 'emperor', 'vengance', 'so', 'forth', 'claim', 'not', 'family', 'movie', 'sex', 'been', 'added', 'story', 'sexulism', 'minimal', 'best', 'i', 'would', 'also', 'remind', 'viewer', 'production', 'tame', 'compared', 'acts', 'written', 'bible', 'new', 'old', 'testement.religion', 'touchy', 'subject', 'modern', 'times', 'are', 'very', 'sensative', 'perhaps', 'why', 'creators', 'production', ""'watered"", 'things', 'down', 'did', 'sociaty', 'become', 'so', 'touchy', 'subject', 'even', 'statements', 'review', 'may', 'come', 'attack', 'i', 'would', 'rather', 'avoid', 'such', 'debates', 'say', 'relgion', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'personal', 'matter.that', 'said', 'production', 'interests', 'still', 'main', 'story', 'struggle', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'rebellious', 'conquest', 'Judea', 'how', 'two', 'good', 'friends', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'events', 'lives', 'are', 'forever', 'changed', 'story', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'life', 'strugggles', 'interaction', 'Roman', 'Jewish', 'world', 'tale', 'how', 'Jerusleam', 'resisted', 'conquest', 'Rome', 'was', 'utlimatly', 'dominated', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'again', 'also', 'story', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'betayal', 'thirst', 'vengance', 'actions', 'changes', 'results', 'i', 'think', 'goals.i', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'i', 'dont', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'then', 'movie/series', 'book', 'one', 'book', 'then', 'read', 'present', 'state', 'affairs', 'i', 'would', 'say', 'pleasing', 'production', 'well', 'attention.as', 'other', 'matters', 'well', 'i', 'would', 'say', 'viewer', 'can', 'take', 'insert', 'own', 'views']",Ben Hur

Not as grandiose as the original, but in my opinion that is what made it better.  I liked the fact that it happened in Jerusalem and not in Rome. I think the actors who were in this version made you feel more for the characters they portrayed and you felt you knew them better.
