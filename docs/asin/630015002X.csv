197040,A2EOFYRFB292KS,630015002X,"Alberto M. Barral ""NY LuxViewer""","[3, 3]","I absolutely love Japanese cinema but I would advice caution for beginners here as the violence is constant and pretty extreme.The story follows the life of Ryunosuke Tsukue (Tatsuya Nakadai), an evil samurai, that was once fascinated by the concept of evil and totally sucumbed to it through mindless violence. He is a  master swordsman with an unorthodox, unpredictable style that is the key to his ferocious success. Ryunosuke first appearence is marked by the unholy act of killing an elderly Buddhist pilgrim, whom he stumbles upon while praying for death/reincarnation. He appears to have no regrets. Critic Chuck Stephens charts the ascendancy of this `eighth samurai' and perfectly describes him thus: ""Nakadai displayed an unadorned exterior that tended less toward suave than somehow slightly embalmed. The qualities that truly define him are those that seem sprung from electrifying forces deep within--a stentorian baritone that might belong to the devil's own ventriloquist dummy, and a pair of orb-wide eyes as alabaster as snake's eggs so eerily inner-illuminated they threaten to rupture into liquid light."" This description is 100% accurate for this film.Later, he kills again this time, an opponent in a fencing competition that degenerated into a duel after he abused his opponent's wife. This forces him to leave his home town with this traumatized woman who becomes attached to him and actually loves this monster. To make a living, Ryunosuke decides to  join  a group of unemployed samurai and travelling bandits that group together to make up a quasy-official security force made up of Ronin warriors who support the Tokugawa Shogunate through an enforced policy of murder and assassinations.Whether killing a man or at home with his woman and their baby son, Ryunosuke never shows any emotion. His expression is fixed in an empty, characteristic  stare that suggests the insanity we know must be a component of a serial killer's psyche.Eventually Ryunosuke learns that the brother of the man he killed in the fencing match is looking for him, intent on revenge. He plans to meet this man and kill him, among other things because his woman tells him to spare him,but before the duel can take place,events start to develop that are going to tilt his self-assurance and the outcome of the film.In a failed assassination attempt, he stands by as a witness, as another master swordsman, Shimada Toranosuke (Toshiro Mifune), destroys all his oponents on Ryunosuke's team under the light of an eerily snowy night, and for the first time he doubts that his own skill is as unbeatable as he believed. That same night, Ryunosuke's woman, horrified by his persistantly evil disposition, tries to kill him iwhile he sleeps. She runs to him dagger in hand and we almost think she has done it, when he springs and overcomes her. Although she confesses to love him still, she begs him to kill her rather than to abandon her and the baby. He surprises her by complying, with a single stroke he takes her down and while we never actually see him killing the baby, he flees without keeping his appointment for the duel with the avenging brother, so we can assume that the baby dies abandoned.Later he meets up with the gang of assassins at a geisha house of pleasure. In a room where a beautiful geisha killed herself in the past, he is holding one of the girls because he believes she overheard his conversation, the girl starts to see the ghost of the geisha first, and then he starts seeing the ghosts of all the people he has butchered in his own past. Furthermore, he is haunted by the words he heard from Shimada: ""The sword is the soul. Study the soul to know the sword. An evil soul is an evil sword.""All hell breaks lose wneh he realizes from her nervous stuttering, that the geisha sent to entertain him is actually the granddaughter of that pilgrim he had murdered at the beginning of the movie.He starts slashing at the shadows of the ghosts that he thinks he hears around him, breaking walls, and anything surrounding him that he can slash with his blade. He then turns on his fellow assassins, who seem to multiply the more he kills them off. In one several minutes-long sequence of a sword fight, which has to be one of the longest ever made, Ryunosuke keeps on  killing until we feel the entire gang may well be wiped out of existence.At some point in the struggle a fire develops and rages through the house and he keeps on slashing his enemies, except at an ever slower place as he is bleeding profusely from his wounds, and suddenly as he thrusts towards us the camera freezes and the movie is over. We don't know the outcome.I found out that the movie was suppossed to be part of a series as it was inspired on an eleven-volume samurai novel. But the author of the books died before he could finish the novel and we will never know what ending he had in store for that neurotic killing machine, Ryunosuke Tsukue.",5,Samurai Bloody Masterpiece,1248048000,"07 20, 2009",2009,4938,"['absolutely', 'love', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'would', 'advice', 'caution', 'beginners', 'here', 'violence', 'constant', 'pretty', 'extreme.The', 'story', 'life', 'Ryunosuke', 'Tsukue', 'Tatsuya', 'Nakadai', 'evil', 'samurai', 'was', 'once', 'fascinated', 'concept', 'evil', 'totally', 'sucumbed', 'mindless', 'violence', 'master', 'swordsman', 'unorthodox', 'unpredictable', 'style', 'key', 'ferocious', 'success', 'Ryunosuke', 'first', 'appearence', 'marked', 'unholy', 'act', 'killing', 'elderly', 'Buddhist', 'pilgrim', 'whom', 'praying', 'death/reincarnation', 'have', 'regrets', 'Critic', 'Chuck', 'Stephens', 'ascendancy', 'eighth', 'samurai', 'perfectly', 'thus', 'Nakadai', 'displayed', 'unadorned', 'exterior', 'tended', 'less', 'suave', 'somehow', 'slightly', 'embalmed', 'qualities', 'truly', 'define', 'are', 'seem', 'sprung', 'electrifying', 'forces', 'deep', 'stentorian', 'baritone', 'might', 'belong', 'devil', 'own', 'ventriloquist', 'dummy', 'pair', 'orb-wide', 'eyes', 'as', 'alabaster', 'snake', 'eggs', 'so', 'eerily', 'inner-illuminated', 'threaten', 'rupture', 'liquid', 'light', 'description', '100', '%', 'accurate', 'film.Later', 'again', 'time', 'opponent', 'fencing', 'competition', 'degenerated', 'duel', 'abused', 'opponent', 'wife', 'leave', 'home', 'town', 'traumatized', 'woman', 'who', 'attached', 'actually', 'monster', 'make', 'living', 'Ryunosuke', 'join', 'group', 'unemployed', 'samurai', 'travelling', 'bandits', 'group', 'together', 'make', 'up', 'quasy-official', 'security', 'force', 'made', 'Ronin', 'warriors', 'who', 'support', 'Tokugawa', 'Shogunate', 'enforced', 'policy', 'murder', 'assassinations.Whether', 'killing', 'man', 'home', 'woman', 'baby', 'son', 'Ryunosuke', 'never', 'emotion', 'expression', 'fixed', 'empty', 'characteristic', 'stare', 'insanity', 'know', 'must', 'be', 'component', 'serial', 'killer', 'psyche.Eventually', 'Ryunosuke', 'brother', 'man', 'killed', 'fencing', 'match', 'looking', 'intent', 'revenge', 'meet', 'man', 'kill', 'other', 'things', 'woman', 'spare', 'duel', 'can', 'take', 'place', 'events', 'start', 'develop', 'are', 'going', 'tilt', 'self-assurance', 'outcome', 'film.In', 'failed', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'witness', 'master', 'swordsman', 'Shimada', 'Toranosuke', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'oponents', 'Ryunosuke', 'team', 'light', 'eerily', 'snowy', 'night', 'first', 'time', 'own', 'skill', 'as', 'unbeatable', 'believed', 'same', 'night', 'Ryunosuke', 'woman', 'horrified', 'persistantly', 'evil', 'disposition', 'kill', 'iwhile', 'sleeps', 'dagger', 'hand', 'almost', 'think', 'done', 'when', 'love', 'still', 'begs', 'kill', 'rather', 'abandon', 'baby', 'complying', 'single', 'stroke', 'down', 'never', 'actually', 'see', 'killing', 'baby', 'keeping', 'appointment', 'duel', 'avenging', 'brother', 'can', 'assume', 'baby', 'abandoned.Later', 'up', 'gang', 'assassins', 'geisha', 'house', 'pleasure', 'room', 'where', 'beautiful', 'geisha', 'killed', 'past', 'holding', 'one', 'girls', 'overheard', 'conversation', 'girl', 'see', 'ghost', 'geisha', 'first', 'then', 'seeing', 'ghosts', 'people', 'butchered', 'own', 'past', 'Furthermore', 'haunted', 'words', 'heard', 'Shimada', 'sword', 'soul', 'Study', 'soul', 'know', 'sword', 'evil', 'soul', 'evil', 'sword', 'hell', 'breaks', 'lose', 'nervous', 'stuttering', 'geisha', 'sent', 'entertain', 'actually', 'granddaughter', 'pilgrim', 'had', 'murdered', 'beginning', 'movie.He', 'slashing', 'shadows', 'ghosts', 'breaking', 'walls', 'anything', 'surrounding', 'can', 'slash', 'blade', 'then', 'fellow', 'assassins', 'who', 'seem', 'multiply', 'more', 'off', 'one', 'several', 'minutes-long', 'sequence', 'sword', 'fight', 'be', 'one', 'longest', 'ever', 'made', 'Ryunosuke', 'killing', 'feel', 'entire', 'gang', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'wiped', 'existence.At', 'point', 'struggle', 'fire', 'develops', 'rages', 'house', 'slashing', 'enemies', 'ever', 'slower', 'place', 'bleeding', 'profusely', 'wounds', 'suddenly', 'towards', 'camera', 'freezes', 'movie', 'over', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'outcome.I', 'found', 'out', 'movie', 'was', 'suppossed', 'be', 'part', 'series', 'was', 'inspired', 'eleven-volume', 'samurai', 'novel', 'author', 'books', 'died', 'could', 'finish', 'novel', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'ending', 'had', 'store', 'neurotic', 'killing', 'machine', 'Ryunosuke', 'Tsukue']",Sword of Doom VHS

197043,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,630015002X,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","...almost.I'm not a huge fan of the samurai film; that is to say that I haven't seen very many and the few that I have seen have been less than truly impressive.  I don't really know why I decided to give `Dai-Bosatsu Toge' a try really, but I did and I was left feeling quite different than expected.This film is actually very good.The most impressive thing about this film is none other than Kihachi Okamoto, the films director.  He masterfully floats in and out of swordplay as if he were merely observing from a safe place, giving us a wide range of visual capabilities; but what is all the more impressive is when he leaves his perch and dives down into the grit of it all, dodging blows as it were; engaging the audience with the brutality of the scene.  This is quite possibly some of the best direction of an action film to date; moving and visceral.The film tells of samurai Ryunosuke Tsukue, a sociopath of sorts who has developed his own breed of fencing that compliments his difficult and arrogant attitude.  When he breaks the code of honor and kills a man in the ring, after swearing to spare him, he finds that his ways are catching up to him in more ways than one.  Soon he is fighting to preserve his own life at the hands of those who at one time feared him.Tatsuya Nakadai is disturbingly accurate as Ryunosuke, evoking in himself this subtle rage that permeates his every scene.  He us commanding with just a glance, enveloping his area with this man's evil.  Michiyo Aratama has probably the most effective performance in the film, as Ohama, the widow of the slain fighter.  Her portrayal of this woman's loyalties and fears is moving and genuine; especially in her final scenes.The film ends somewhat ambiguously, since it was originally intended to the first of many based on the novel written by Kaizan Nakazato.  As far as I am aware though, those future films never happened.  That said, as much as the ending feels justified it also feels unfair, for I wanted something more concrete.  It doesn't take away from the film any, and is actually a highlight for some, but on a personal level I didn't connect as strongly as I wanted to.  Maybe if the sequels had been filmed and I had somewhere to go with this story, but with the ending so abrupt and open I feel almost robbed of the complete experience I was promised.Still, it is a film that many will enjoy and one that any fan of the genre will adore.  It is quick paced, expertly acted and brilliantly directed.  It is crisp and intelligent and thought provoking and one that I highly recommend.",4,Visually stunning and expertly crafted; this film is almost perfect...,1230508800,"12 29, 2008",2008,2574,"['almost.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'samurai', 'film', 'say', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'very', 'many', 'few', 'have', 'seen', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'truly', 'impressive', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'why', 'decided', 'give', 'Dai-Bosatsu', 'Toge', 'try', 'really', 'did', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'quite', 'different', 'expected.This', 'film', 'actually', 'very', 'good.The', 'most', 'impressive', 'thing', 'film', 'none', 'other', 'Kihachi', 'Okamoto', 'films', 'director', 'masterfully', 'swordplay', 'were', 'merely', 'observing', 'safe', 'place', 'giving', 'wide', 'range', 'visual', 'capabilities', 'what', 'more', 'impressive', 'when', 'perch', 'down', 'grit', 'dodging', 'blows', 'were', 'engaging', 'audience', 'brutality', 'scene', 'quite', 'possibly', 'best', 'direction', 'action', 'film', 'date', 'moving', 'visceral.The', 'film', 'tells', 'samurai', 'Ryunosuke', 'Tsukue', 'sociopath', 'sorts', 'who', 'developed', 'own', 'breed', 'fencing', 'difficult', 'arrogant', 'attitude', 'When', 'code', 'honor', 'man', 'ring', 'swearing', 'spare', 'ways', 'are', 'catching', 'up', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'Soon', 'fighting', 'preserve', 'own', 'life', 'hands', 'who', 'one', 'time', 'feared', 'him.Tatsuya', 'Nakadai', 'disturbingly', 'accurate', 'Ryunosuke', 'evoking', 'subtle', 'rage', 'scene', 'commanding', 'just', 'glance', 'enveloping', 'area', 'man', 'evil', 'Michiyo', 'Aratama', 'probably', 'most', 'effective', 'performance', 'film', 'Ohama', 'widow', 'slain', 'fighter', 'portrayal', 'woman', 'loyalties', 'fears', 'moving', 'genuine', 'especially', 'final', 'scenes.The', 'film', 'somewhat', 'ambiguously', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'first', 'many', 'based', 'novel', 'written', 'Kaizan', 'Nakazato', 'As', 'far', 'am', 'aware', 'future', 'films', 'never', 'happened', 'said', 'as', 'much', 'ending', 'feels', 'justified', 'also', 'unfair', 'wanted', 'something', 'more', 'concrete', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'film', 'actually', 'highlight', 'personal', 'level', 'did', ""n't"", 'connect', 'as', 'strongly', 'wanted', 'Maybe', 'sequels', 'had', 'been', 'filmed', 'had', 'somewhere', 'go', 'story', 'ending', 'so', 'abrupt', 'open', 'feel', 'almost', 'robbed', 'complete', 'experience', 'was', 'promised.Still', 'film', 'many', 'will', 'enjoy', 'one', 'fan', 'genre', 'will', 'adore', 'quick', 'paced', 'expertly', 'acted', 'brilliantly', 'directed', 'crisp', 'intelligent', 'thought', 'provoking', 'one', 'highly', 'recommend']",Sword of Doom VHS
197044,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,630015002X,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[4, 4]","Unaware that 'The Sword of Doom' was intended as the first of a trilogy, my initial reaction was incredulity at the ending.  After some research and reflection, I believe that director Kihachi Okamoto succeeded regardless of the unresolved ending.  It may have even enhanced the movie.Tatsuya Nakadai (who went on to play Lord Hidetora Ichimonji in Kurosawa's 'Ran') is Rynosuke Tsukue, a sociopathic ronin in the waning years of the Tokugawa Shogunate.  His corruption precipitates a distended chain of events, until ghosts from the past assault his weakened sanity while corporeal enemies attack in the real world.  Toshiro Mifune shines in an understated cameo, which made me wonder about the over-the-top roles he did for Kurosawa (The pair's collaboration had ended the year before.)  In fact, for me, Okamoto's direction was clear and coherent, and I'd recommend this movie to those who have questioned Kurosawa's highly stylized methods if only for another view of Japanese cinema.However, 'Sword' is firmly ensconced in the samurai genre, with its requisite sword fights involving the protagonist battling overwhelming odds - and succeeding.  I understand that this is de rigueur, and 'Sword' has plenty enough to satisfy convention, but a far more compelling aspect of the film is Nakadai's performance as the amoral samurai.  Enough distance exists between the viewer and the film that his acting is entertaining instead of disturbing, but it is excellent nonetheless, and introduces gray shades in a genre that, from what I've seen, is traditionally all black or all white.This Criterion edition is stunning - a crisp transfer that lacks nothing in comparison to a color feature.  The crispness highlights Okamoto's energetic and unique (in my uneducated opinion) direction - he may not have the reputation of Kurosawa, but several times I noted his inspired camera work, and realized that his own style was more than satisfactory.After viewers are armed with the information that they are not going to get any traditional resolution to the film, I'd highly recommend this movie to fans of the samurai genre and of film in general.  Nakadai impeccably portrays a sociopath's descent into madness, and Okamoto is a splendid director - taken together, the effect is an excellent and entertaining film, and a chance to reevaluate my assumptions about Japanese cinema.",5,Part I of a Nonexistent Trilogy,1249084800,"08 1, 2009",2009,2375,"['Unaware', 'Sword', 'Doom', 'was', 'intended', 'first', 'trilogy', 'initial', 'reaction', 'was', 'incredulity', 'ending', 'research', 'reflection', 'believe', 'director', 'Kihachi', 'Okamoto', 'succeeded', 'regardless', 'unresolved', 'ending', 'may', 'have', 'even', 'enhanced', 'movie.Tatsuya', 'Nakadai', 'who', 'went', 'play', 'Lord', 'Hidetora', 'Ichimonji', 'Kurosawa', ""'Ran"", 'Rynosuke', 'Tsukue', 'sociopathic', 'ronin', 'waning', 'years', 'Tokugawa', 'Shogunate', 'corruption', 'distended', 'chain', 'events', 'ghosts', 'past', 'assault', 'weakened', 'sanity', 'corporeal', 'enemies', 'attack', 'real', 'world', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'shines', 'understated', 'cameo', 'made', 'wonder', 'over-the-top', 'roles', 'did', 'Kurosawa', 'pair', 'collaboration', 'had', 'ended', 'year', 'before', 'fact', 'Okamoto', 'direction', 'was', 'clear', 'coherent', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'who', 'have', 'questioned', 'Kurosawa', 'highly', 'stylized', 'methods', 'only', 'view', 'Japanese', 'cinema.However', ""'Sword"", 'firmly', 'ensconced', 'samurai', 'genre', 'requisite', 'sword', 'fights', 'involving', 'protagonist', 'battling', 'overwhelming', 'odds', 'succeeding', 'understand', 'de', 'rigueur', ""'Sword"", 'plenty', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'convention', 'far', 'more', 'compelling', 'aspect', 'film', 'Nakadai', 'performance', 'amoral', 'samurai', 'Enough', 'distance', 'exists', 'viewer', 'film', 'acting', 'entertaining', 'instead', 'disturbing', 'excellent', 'nonetheless', 'introduces', 'gray', 'shades', 'genre', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'traditionally', 'black', 'white.This', 'Criterion', 'edition', 'stunning', 'crisp', 'transfer', 'nothing', 'comparison', 'color', 'feature', 'crispness', 'highlights', 'Okamoto', 'energetic', 'unique', 'uneducated', 'opinion', 'direction', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'reputation', 'Kurosawa', 'several', 'times', 'noted', 'inspired', 'camera', 'work', 'realized', 'own', 'style', 'was', 'more', 'satisfactory.After', 'viewers', 'are', 'armed', 'information', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'get', 'traditional', 'resolution', 'film', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'fans', 'samurai', 'genre', 'film', 'general', 'Nakadai', 'impeccably', 'sociopath', 'descent', 'madness', 'Okamoto', 'splendid', 'director', 'taken', 'together', 'effect', 'excellent', 'entertaining', 'film', 'chance', 'reevaluate', 'assumptions', 'Japanese', 'cinema']",Sword of Doom VHS
197045,A1L220BNTP6WYZ,630015002X,Charles Hugh Smith,"[6, 7]","As those of you familiar with the genre might expect, Sword of Doom depicts tremendous violence. Most of the swordplay is highly stylized, but if seeing 20+ swordsmen cut down is not your cup of tea, you might decide to pass on the film. In a way, that would be a shame, for this film speaks not just to Japanese culture and history, but to universal themes of evil and revenge.The movie stars the incomparable Tatsuya Nakadai as a heartless--some might even say sociopathic-- samurai who has mastered a non-standard, unorthodox style of kendo or fencing. Perhaps it is his unorthodox style, or his ruthlessness, or both, but he has been kicked out of his kendo school. This establishes him as a ronin, or masterless samurai--in our nomenclature, a lone wolf.The movie is set in a time of social dissolution and turmoil, the early 1860s, when the feudal order which had held sway over Japan for over 200 years was breaking apart. The Meiji Restoration of 1868 restored social order by dissolving the Shogunate in favor of the Imperial household. (In practical terms, a ruling-class oligarchy was established.)Thus later in the film, Nakadai's mistress bemoans his lack of standing, commenting that in earlier time, he would have had his own kendo school and they could have lived comfortably. Instead, Nakadai is forced to hire himself out as a political assassin for a pittance; he consoles himself by drinking prodigious quantities of sake (rice wine).Early on, Nakadai dispatches an unarmed elderly man and shortly thereafter, an opponent in what was supposed to be a non-lethal match. (In exchange for her favors, he'd secretly agreed with his opponent's wife to throw the match. Alas, the cuckolded husband tried to dispatch him, forcing Nakadai to kill him.)These unsavory scenes establish Nakadai as ruthless, amoral and maddeningly difficult to kill. Nonetheless, the outlines of his own unorthodox code of conduct are visible. The elderly man had been praying to be released from this life; overhearing the gent's plea to Buddha, Nakadai took it upon himself to grant the man's stated wish via his sword.And Nakadai held to his bargain with the other samurai's wife, allowing the match to be a draw, until his opponent tried to kill him with an illegal move. But there is a karmic consequence of these needless killings, and a subplot of revenge is set in motion, building our anticipation of a classic showdown in the final reel.But our expectations are foiled. I won't give away the ending, except to say it is not the one-on-one ""good guy versus bad guy"" showdown we are led to expect, but a harrowing melee in a burning Japanese house in which Nakadai takes on the entire clan who'd engaged him as a sword-for-hire.Online sources say this ""unsatisfying"" ending results from the film originally being planned as the first of a trilogy. I respectfully submit that the filmaker designed this movie to stand on its own, and deliberately chose a very 1960s ""anti-expectation"" ending.This final climatic sword battle--truly one of the great action sequences of world film, in my humble view--is unleashed by a betrayal (the clan tries to kill Nakadai) and a ghostly visit by Nakadai's victims, who haunt him to the edge of madness. One online reviewer scoffed at this haunting (shall we also then dismiss Shakespeare's Hamlet?), but ghosts (obake, spirits, etc.), animism and various superstitions are key elements of Japanese culture. That Nakadai's descent into madness begins with a haunting is essentially Japanese.Those of you who are Japanese or who have lived in Japan for years may disagree, but I see this film as a critique of the Japanese reverence for mastery--an unplanned, subconscious critique or a conscious one, I can't say. Acting legend Toshiro Mifune plays the master of another kendo school, and in a meeting with Nakadai he proclaims that ""The sword is the soul. Study the soul to know the sword. Evil mind, evil sword.""For his part, the Nakadai character exclaims, ""I trust only my sword in this world. When I fight, I have no family."" That is, he has no loyalty to anyone but himself and his mastery of the sword. Mifune's comment--the sword is the soul--embodies the ideal of mastery; in Japan, masters of craft are revered as Living Masters.Mifune is proclaiming a moral truism: if the heart is evil, so too will be the mastery.

I haven't seen all of his films, but I might actually claim that this could be Tatsuya Nakadai's signature role.The story never explains how or why, but the main character has become evil...thus the traditional role of protagonist in this film and the role of villian are one and the same character! Why he's evil, the film doesn't explain. Is it the sword itself that is cursed and makes the weilder become evil, or he just a man going insane over time? We'll never know.While the Star Wars Prequels attempt to turn a main character into a villian, with the transformation of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader, ""Sword of Doom"" does a better job in putting the viewer into the mind of a dark villian.This is a dark film, and a truly evil one in ways. Somehow, it feels empowering to watch this movie. It's a strange movie in that the plot really doesn't have a beginning, nor does it actually end in any traditional manner, with all the plot details wrapping up to any kind of final conclusion.The cinematography of this film is bold, creative, and dynamic. The camera-angles are unorthodox at times and the use of natural elements such as rain and snow are filmed in a way to bring a lot of depth and originality to the movie.I'm not sure why I never heard of this movie before? It's definately a true sleeper. The main character/villian with his face hidden behind his large wicker-basket hat might possibly have been the original inspiration behind the ""Raiden"" character of Mortal Kombat? The sword fighting style in this film is extraordinarily well done and conceived. The discussion in the movie by the characters about styles and techniques is interesting and gives us, the viewer, a sense of reality behind the swordmanship.I highly recommend this movie.

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[5, 5]","Tatsuya Nakadai plays a marvelously evil samurai who only finds greatness at the cost of madness in this 1966 bloody Japanese film, SWORD OF DOOM.Structured like a good novel (and based on one by Kaizan Nakazato), DOOM allows the viewer to follow the lives of several separate people -- two samurais, two women, and a thief -- as they are inexorably drawn closer and closer together ... and a seemingly chance meeting brings this boiling masterpiece to a violent, destructive head.However, the real mastery of this film is the sword choreography, though Nakadai's brooding menace certainly keeps the viewer riveted to the screen.  Rarely has a samurai film moved to the level of the bloodbath fighting that quite probably was associated to true samurai matches, and certainly, as the product packaging provides, nods to influences of Peckinpah, Leone, and (much later) John Woo are warranted.  The climax -- the inevitable explosion of a man driven mad by the ghosts of his past -- is brilliantly staged and executed.Along for the ride in a blistering cameo is Toshiro Mifune who, in five minutes of screen time, shows what a tour de force performance is truly meant to be.If DOOM has any shortcoming, it might be an inability to reach a suitable conclusion with Western sensibilities.  American influences almost require a neat and tidy packaged ending to films, and DOOM postulates one much like BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID where the fate of the participants is largely left to the imagination of the viewer.  As the mad Nakadai swings and swings his way through his final showdowns with the gang he has long served, the audience is never given the ultimate vision of his survival or demise ... and that's the beauty of the tale.

197055,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,630015002X,Ernest Jagger,"[4, 4]","I have always been impressed by (Tatsuya Nakadai), ever since I watched his performance as the demented and pyschotic ronin in the Zatoichi episode of ""The Festival of Fire"" [recommended if you have not seen this particular Zatoichi episode]. The swordplay in ""The Sword of Doom"" is very impressive, but it is the character of  Ryunosuke Tsukue (Tatsuya Nakadai) as a violent, evil and totally sociopathic samurai, which makes this film a very good view. There is no Bushido code for Ryunosuke in this film. He is as violent and bloody as they come.The year in the film is set in 1860, as the shogunate is beginning to wane from history and just a mere eight years away from the Meiji Restoration: And it is a time when many samurai are no longer interested in honor, or the Bushido code. Here we find the films main antagonist, Ryunosuke Tsukue, aptly portrayed by (Tatsuya Nakadai). And with his sword as an extension of his personality, the viewer will find that the film is as bloody as they come. The film is very complex, and the characters of both (Tatsuya Nakadai) and (Toshiro Mifune) as Toranosuke Shimada must be watched very closely. Both give superb performances. As do the rest of the characters in the film.The beginning of the film gives you an idea of what type of character the samurai Ryunosuke is all about. When a grandfather and his granddaughter rest at a small shrine after traveling for miles, the young granddaughter goes to fetch some water before beginning again on their journey. As the grandfather prays to Buddha at the shrine, the samurai murders the old man with his sword as if the old man were a mere distraction. Ryunosuke is truly a frightening man, and all the more dangerous due to the fact that his skills as a sword weilding samurai are very good.

With my friends, I visited all of them on a regular basis. I fell in love with the first rank directors such as Kurosawa, Ozu, and Mizoguchi; but trailing not far behind them were other greats such as Kihachi Okamato (SWORD OF DOOM), Masaki Kobayashi (HARAKIRI), Kazuo Ikehiro (the Kyoshiro Nemuri samurai films from Daiei), Hiroshi Inagaki (the SAMURAI trilogy), and others.Okamoto was one of the best directors of action samurai films; and SWORD OF DOOM is one of his best films. Tatsuya Nakadai stars as an evil samurai who is seemingly invincible, the sole master of a sword fighting style that runs counter-intuitive to all the existing styles of his day. Toshiro Mifune has a small role as the master of a sword-fighting school who tries to counter Nakadai's baneful influence during the last days of the Tokugawa Shogunate.The unique contribution to this film is the notion that evil destroys itself from within. In the last scene, Nakadai and some of his henchmen are at a geisha house. Overcome with drink, Nakadai sees the ghosts of his victims and runs amok trying to attack them. I won't say what happens, because I would hate to ruin the ending for you.If you like the classical samurai films of the 1960s, this one is a must for you.

197057,A1HXR6PIRTO0UO,630015002X,J_J_Gittes,"[0, 0]","As I was wondering what to watch this morning and saw The Criterion Edition DVD of Kihachi Okamoto's ""The Sword of Doom"" on my shelf, I thought of watching it after a silent short of Wladyslaw Starewicz as a sort of light entertainment. Not expecting much, I put it in my DVD player and prepared to relax for the coming two hours. As I had seen a copy of this DVD in my local library a week ago, I had never heard anything of the director I remembered, and the back cover that spoke of lots of violence and blood, made me expect an exploitation film in the vein of a Seijun Suzuki only with Samurais and in full color. So I was surprised and a bit disappointed when the film began in black and white. But I was soon to be disabused. The films black and white photography is a stunning example of the use of light I have seen in some 60s japanese films (e.g. Seijun Suzuki's Branded to Kill).Shot in stark contrast, the film always seems a bit overexposed, creating an atmosphere in witch the viewer may already feel some of the pain of the characters, and the harshness of the period depicted, through his own constant effort of the eyes while watching. The characters strain and stress, the atmosphere's tautness is matched by the films style. The widescreen format is used to its fullest by cinematographer Hiroshi Murai, almost every frame a prime example of staging for camera, achieving awe-inspiring compositions which mirror the characters emotions and obsessions, always bringing the directors intentions to light in a most original way. The editing is meticulous, being always right on spot, and at its best not only enhancing the films atmosphere and flow, but deepening our understanding of the characters psychological profiles. This combination of camerawork and editing makes the film on a formal level one of the finest I've ever seen. But complementing this is an emotional richness that speaks of the directors own experience, and the life he witnessed during his time in the Army in the second World War. Being an assistant director to amongst others Mikio Naruse right after the war, we can witness Okamoto with ""The Sword of Doom"" already in possession not only of a full-fledged independent perspective on life itself, but also of a cinematic skill, only few directors were able to achieve and put to use in the history of cinema.In an essay accompanying the DVD-edition, film-scholar Geoffrey O'Brien compares Okamoto to contemporaries like Seijun Suzuki and Akira Kurosawa, but places him under both, calling him only a very competent genre-director, as he fails to reach under the films surface and find a sense in the films undertaking besides its obvious merits, when in fact Okamoto with this film alone must be ranked as a humanist director on par with names like Kurosawa, Ozu and Mizoguchi. And with his clear moral standpoint he is still miles ahead of the formal brilliance and playful nihilistic stance of Seijun Suzuki's 60s films or other genre directors of this time. Whatever Suzukis merits (and those of his colleagues) on their own may be, their filmic rebellion was one against an established way of filmmaking, a rebellion against the restrictions made by studios that wanted traditional clear-cut products that would make a maximum profit. But Kihachi Okamoto, at least with ""The Sword of Doom"", isn't just rebelling against an industry, but against the society that could bring such an industry to existence. The film's subversive nature goes so far, that it reverses the assumed creative restrictions, in a way comparable to the ""dogme""-filmmaking in the 90s. By (unvoluntarily) restricting himself, Okamoto arrives at a freedom of expression he couldn't have achieved better in any other way. A rebellion that doesn't need to rebell anymore because it has already achieved what it set out to do within the established framework. This may also explain why the politics and social circumstances in the film are only a background for the character, who isn't concerned with any of it. What Okamoto is aiming at exceeds society's borders by far, as his endeavour takes him to one of the most pressing existential problems, the questioning of the human soul.The beauty of the sceneries and their formal rendering are thereby a powerful contrast to the cruelty and at times outright nihilism of the characters behaviour. The years presented in the film are the early 1860's in Japan and the events preceding the Meiji restoration in 1868 when the power of the Emperor was restored. These years of political turmoil are depicted as a gruesome period in which traditional bonds where slowly dissolving as it was hard to arrive at a steady existential and ideological orientation during an ever shifting environment, in which violence and poverty reigned on the streets.At the beginning we are introduced to the main protagonist Ryunosuke Tsukue, played with startling intensity by Tatsuya Nakadai, who serves as an indicator for the contradictions and problems of the times. A vessel containing all that's wrong with society itself he is a psychotic figure who seems to bring upon his surroundings the wrath of fate itself. Right from the start he is torn between his desire and longing for an affiliation of sorts, a redemption of all his sins (or maybe even the worlds), and a feeling that he's already too much an outcome of his times, being unable to lay down his sword and change his life. He's at once an angel fallen to earth who's bringing about its destruction, and a human being deeply in conflict with himself, his instincts and emotions.The tragic of the film and the character, and thus of its time, seems to be the unability to change, to do good when it is most needed, and the powerlessness of man in the face of a human society that is bringing about its own end. Throughout the film we see Ryunosuke struggle to preserve his humanity though it has been lost to him from the beginning. In this lies the main strength and humanity of what the film tries to achieve. The Struggle of man against his fate, no matter how hopeless it may seem, even while facing defeat, is what ultimately makes a person human. To let us experience this through a seemingly nihilistic character, confronting us with a bleak world, is a bold undertaking in which Okamoto succeeds in a magnificent way.The film was initially planned and executed as the first installment in a much larger tale, and it is a huge loss that the sequels were never made. Nevertheless this film alone, with all its ambiguities and gaps, already stands firmly on its own, displaying all the features needed to establish it as a major work of art.",5,a search for

It's an uncomfortable feeling; indeed, you're never comfortable (or supposed to be) when watching this film. Nakadai is haunting as the protagonist. You may think that you know what to expect, but this isn't your garden-variety psychotic madman that Hollywood loves to include in film after film, like a bad stereotype. Nakadai (save for one exception) never makes an outburst or a sudden, unexpected move. It's this ""quality"" that makes him more accessible to viewers. Your typical madman is someone you want to keep your distance from, for you never know what he'll do, but Nakadai's calmness invites you to lean forward and study him closely. There are a few scenes where he is depressed on the floor of his shack and you could swear that you'd be able to lean in an inch from his face and look him over without him caring or flinching. He's yet a cold-blooded killer, making for a seemingly interesting contradiction. He kills those in his way when he is out, then lays on the floor and gets drunk on sake when he's at home. Is it a lamenting of how things are and have to be or could it possibly be guilt?Sword of Doom is very well acted, has beautiful photography and has an engaging plot. It could've become a great film if it were not for the ending. I won't give it away, but not much is resolved (perhaps a sequel was intended?). This makes for a somewhat unsatisfying experience, especially if plot resolution is important to your enjoyment of films (as it is for most of us). You must, instead, appreciate the finer elements of the film, such as the performances, the art and the tragedy. If you're prepared for this, Sword of Doom is a mesmerizing film that should be checked out.Edit: I wonder why so many people find my review unhelpful. Is it because they're fans who have already seen the film and disagree with me about how satisfying the ending is? I might remind them that the helpfulness rating is intended solely for people new to the product. You don't need help making a decision if you've already seen/used it. I think that my review is helpful because some people care about endings.

I bought it on a whim and now Kihachi Okamoto's SWORD OF DOOM is easily in my top ten favorite movies. Besides the subject matter of samurai which is usually just fun with swords, this movie has an amazing plot with many interesting layers and a little bit of insight into the turmoil that japan was going through when trying to end the Shogunate. A warning I would give is to be prepared for, with only one exeption I can think of, some very unsympathetic characters.

Daibosatsu (its title in Japanese) is an amazing piece of film, which has won the adjective of ""classic"".  The original thing about The Sword of Doom is that, Ryunosuke (the principal character), is kind of a psycho.  He almost never expresses any emotions always talking in a cold, slow, heartless, monotone, emotionless tone (only twice he laughs and is an eerie thing to listen), in a  simple, if-you-said-the-wrong-thing-I'm-going-to-slay-you kind of way.  The guy doesn't even blink.  He doesn't care if someone wants to kill him.  He kills an old man just because.The story is around the end of the Tokugawa shogunate, when the old order is falling apart and the birth of the Meijin Restoration is at hand.  Although is not necessary, a little bit of knowledge of the period will help to appreciate this movie.  Is in b/c, but it helps the movie.  One of the things I like best is that it shows what a real swordfight using katanas would look like, not the fancy metal clashing against metal of Hollywood, Europe and some Asian(including Japan) movies.  The movie is strange in the sense that you don't develop any emotion for Ryunosuke, even when you know he lacks a few marbles.  As simple as that, he just is, and you accept that.The story is simple, a man is expel from a fencing school, and is challenge to a match (pay attention, a match, no a duel), the winner will become the heir of the school when the sensei dies.  Can't tell you much, (the match turn into a duel...)simply that he is so neutral, so amoral, that makes him dangerous.  His own father wants him dead.  He joins the Shinsengumi, but his lack of emotion, together with his disregard for bushido (well, not always, but enough to piss off a hardcore samurai, and even those times are left to the interpretation), gains him the hatred of his assassin buddies.  (I highly recommend that you read about the Shinsengumi).The movie is great, a simply, yet deep.  A story of a man that is obsessed with improving his swordmanship, no matter who or what he ends destroying.  Buy it, I usually tell people to rent movies first but I doubt you can get this in any rental.  But don't worry, if you like samurai movies, you will like this one. Unless you hate enimagtic endings...which for me, it makes the story even better.",4,"A GREAT EPIC, ENIGMATIC TO THE END",1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,2345,"['just', 'got', 'Asian', 'films', 'especially', 'Japan', 'Daibosatsu', 'title', 'Japanese', 'amazing', 'piece', 'film', 'won', 'adjective', 'classic', 'original', 'thing', 'Sword', 'Doom', 'Ryunosuke', 'principal', 'character', 'kind', 'psycho', 'almost', 'never', 'emotions', 'always', 'talking', 'cold', 'slow', 'heartless', 'monotone', 'emotionless', 'tone', 'only', 'twice', 'eerie', 'thing', 'listen', 'simple', ""if-you-said-the-wrong-thing-I'm-going-to-slay-you"", 'kind', 'way', 'guy', ""n't"", 'even', 'blink', ""n't"", 'care', 'someone', 'kill', 'old', 'man', 'just', 'because.The', 'story', 'end', 'Tokugawa', 'shogunate', 'when', 'old', 'order', 'falling', 'apart', 'birth', 'Meijin', 'Restoration', 'hand', 'not', 'necessary', 'little', 'bit', 'knowledge', 'period', 'will', 'help', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'b/c', 'movie', 'One', 'things', 'like', 'best', 'what', 'real', 'swordfight', 'using', 'katanas', 'would', 'look', 'not', 'fancy', 'metal', 'clashing', 'metal', 'Hollywood', 'Europe', 'Asian', 'including', 'Japan', 'movies', 'movie', 'strange', 'sense', 'do', ""n't"", 'develop', 'emotion', 'Ryunosuke', 'even', 'when', 'know', 'few', 'marbles', 'As', 'simple', 'just', 'accept', 'that.The', 'story', 'simple', 'man', 'expel', 'fencing', 'school', 'challenge', 'match', 'pay', 'attention', 'match', 'duel', 'winner', 'will', 'become', 'heir', 'school', 'when', 'sensei', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'much', 'match', 'turn', 'duel', 'simply', 'so', 'neutral', 'so', 'amoral', 'dangerous', 'own', 'father', 'dead', 'Shinsengumi', 'lack', 'emotion', 'together', 'disregard', 'bushido', 'well', 'not', 'always', 'enough', 'piss', 'off', 'hardcore', 'samurai', 'even', 'times', 'are', 'left', 'interpretation', 'gains', 'hatred', 'assassin', 'buddies', 'highly', 'recommend', 'read', 'Shinsengumi', '.The', 'movie', 'great', 'simply', 'yet', 'deep', 'story', 'man', 'obsessed', 'improving', 'swordmanship', 'matter', 'who', 'what', 'destroying', 'Buy', 'usually', 'tell', 'people', 'rent', 'movies', 'first', 'doubt', 'can', 'get', 'rental', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'like', 'samurai', 'movies', 'will', 'like', 'one', 'hate', 'enimagtic', 'endings', 'story', 'even', 'better']",Sword of Doom VHS
197062,A6ADO7B6FUVN,630015002X,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[140, 164]","The actions of a man can describe the man's true identity, as the identity of righteousness and moral character are a reflection of a man's actions.  Bushido expresses honor before living, which was the way of the samurai.  This honor seemed to fade away, as large numbers of samurai without masters accrued in cities and other locations around Japan during the 1860s.  At the end of the shogunate in 1868, which also changed the importance of the samurai in the Japanese society, warfare began a drastic change from swords to guns and cannons.  The end of samurai also indicated an end to bushido, which lead many samurai into a more corrupt lifestyle where honor no longer had the same meaning.Sword of Doom opens in the spring of 1860 where a young woman and her grandfather climb a mountain pass where the grandfather is ruthlessly murdered without any apparent reason by the film's antihero, Ryunosuke Tsukue (Tatsuya Nakadai).  Ryunosuke is the symbolic embodiment of the unification of steel and man, as it often was taught by sword masters that one must become one with the sword in order to reach perfection.  When Ryunosuke callously let his sword fall over the girl's grandfather a small bell falls on the rocks, which unsettles him.  However, it seems to be the last time that Ryunosuke will show emotion.Later in the story the audience gets to meet the sword master and teacher Toranosuke Shimada (Toshir Mifune) who suggests, ""The sword is the soul.  Study the soul to know the sword.  Evil mind, evil sword.""  Fundamentally, Toranosuke points out the old way of the samurai where the samurai is one with the sword, as the sword is only an extension of the samurai. Thus, if the man is evil then the sword does evil.  It also implies that the sword is as guilty as the samurai  Further interpretations of Toranosuke's statement could suggest that substantial responsibility and honor come with carrying a sword, as one carries life at the end of the sword.  Toranosuke embraces the values of Bushido as he teaches his student the way of the samurai through fencing.A more contemporary notion suggests that the mind guides the sword to its target, as the sword is cold, distant, and without judgment.  Nonetheless, the sword and other weapons continue to reap new victims such as the grandfather in the beginning of the film.  Ryunosuke's fencing technique, which many do not recognize as the samurai are all of the old and traditional ways, appears cold, strange, and uncanny to those who see him fight, as they wonder where the source of his technique originates.  This brings the notion to the beginning of the film where Ryunosuke kills the grandfather, which seems to be the moment when he perfects his fencing style, a style that seems detached, callous, and without empathy, which seems to be derived from the sword itself.  The story develops this idea even further by displaying Ryunosuke as a calculated and unsympathetic sociopath.After Ryunosuke returns from the mountain pass he is to fight in a sword contest the following day against Bunnojo Utsuki (Ichir Nakaya). Bunnojo's wife, Hama (Michiyo Aratama), visits with Ryunosuke in order to convince him that her husband must win in order to save her family's face.  This meeting leads Hama to face Ryunosuke's coldhearted personality, as he demands her to offer herself to him.  After much contemplation Hama visits Ryunosuke in a mill during the night before his sword contest.  In the morning Hama is approached by Bunnojo who tells her that he has announced their divorce earlier the same morning, as he knows about what she had done.  Anger and pride consume Bunnojo who decides to kill Ryunosuke in the sword contest as payment for his insolence.  However, Bunnojo has no chance against Ryunosuke's strange and distant fencing style.The story continues to surround Ryunosuke who goes into hiding with Hama, as he continues to lend out his sword to those who are willing to pay.  It leads the audience into a downward spiraling tale in which the audience can sense the outcome of Ryunosuke's life.  Nonetheless, it is never certain what will happen as director Kihachi Okamoto continues to darken the atmosphere while the tale unfolds.  Death is dealt without consideration to whomever he is told to slay, as he stares down the eyes of those who gradually sink to the ground with a deep and deadly cut in their flesh.In the backdrop of Ryunosuke there is a samurai uprising that he seems to be involved in while the brother of Bunnojo intends to seek an honorable revenge by killing him.  The young woman who found her grandfather dead in the mountain pass enters the story, as the past seems to catch up with Ryunosuke.  These elements are tied together through Ryunosuke's existence, as he continues to kill for the highest payer.  The continuation of Ryunosuke ruthlessness encourages the audience to think that his destiny must eventually catch up with him and make a full circle.  Lastly, Ryunosuke seems to be a personification of the shogunate, which we know died at the end of the 1860s.Sword of Doom is a marvelously framed film with several intriguing shots that show a meticulous eye for details.  Many of the scenes have wonderful mise-en-scene that elevates the authenticity of the story, which is brought together with a well-performing cast.  The contrasts between Tatsuya Nakadai's character Ryunosuke and Toshir Mifune's performance as Toranosuke visually bring out the different personalities in these two characters.  It is essential to see this contrast, as it provides an insightful view into how different these two are while being very much the same.  Much of the film's chemistry rests on these two characters, even though Toshir Mifune is used sparsely throughout the film.  The unfolding Sword of Doom brings the audience a violent cinematic experience, which offers a historical tale with depth and reflection.",5,"Complex, Profound, and Bloody - The Bushido

On the surface he appears to be detached and vacant, but his eyes speak volumes!  Ever so subtlely, as the film progresses, you can see his eyes change and become ever so slightly more crazed and sad (to the credit of the actor).  It's a great character study!Overall, beyond just the main character, the film itself is fascinating to watch (again, even though it's in b&w;).  The director makes incredible use of imagery to bolster whatever is going on in the story at any particular moment.  The entire film was very watchable and engaging.The film is violent, but this is the nature of the subject matter.  By today's standards of film making, the violence is not exceptional.Other reviewers have commented about what appeared to be a disjointed ending to the film.  For me, the ending worked.  What on the surface may have seemed to be loose ends, on a deeper level I think were irrelevancies to the main character as he progressed in his madness and different events unfolded (such as his witnessing the fight, and victory, by the lone swordfighting teacher against the band of well-armed and skilled samurai). At a minimum, these apparent loose ends present some interesting thoughts to ponder about the internal state of the main character (of course, I could just be overintepreting).Nevertheless, if you like deep character studies, I suggest you give this film a try!",5,Great film!,1277683200,"06 28, 2010",2010,1515,"['really', 'liked', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'even', 'film', 'b', 'w', 'had', 'read', 'subtitles', 'surface', 'be', 'detached', 'vacant', 'eyes', 'speak', 'volumes', 'Ever', 'so', 'subtlely', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'eyes', 'change', 'become', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'more', 'crazed', 'sad', 'credit', 'actor', 'great', 'character', 'study', 'Overall', 'just', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'again', 'even', 'b', 'w', 'director', 'incredible', 'use', 'imagery', 'bolster', 'going', 'story', 'particular', 'moment', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'watchable', 'engaging.The', 'film', 'violent', 'nature', 'subject', 'matter', 'today', 'standards', 'film', 'making', 'violence', 'not', 'exceptional.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'disjointed', 'ending', 'film', 'ending', 'worked', 'What', 'surface', 'may', 'have', 'seemed', 'be', 'loose', 'ends', 'deeper', 'level', 'think', 'were', 'irrelevancies', 'main', 'character', 'progressed', 'madness', 'different', 'events', 'unfolded', 'such', 'witnessing', 'fight', 'victory', 'lone', 'swordfighting', 'teacher', 'band', 'well-armed', 'skilled', 'samurai', 'minimum', 'apparent', 'loose', 'present', 'interesting', 'thoughts', 'ponder', 'internal', 'state', 'main', 'character', 'course', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'overintepreting', '.Nevertheless', 'like', 'deep', 'character', 'studies', 'suggest', 'give', 'film', 'try']",Sword of Doom VHS
197065,A2NJO6YE954DBH,630015002X,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 5]","I believe that the origin of the phrase ""go down swinging"" comes from baseball, but the aptness of the phrase to the end of ""The Sword of Doom"" is hard to ignore.  ""Dai-bosatsu tge"" (literally, ""Daibosatsu Pass"") is a 1966 samurai film by director Kihachi Okamoto (""Nikudan,"" ""Daiyukai"") whose evil protagonist is the dead-eyed Ryunosuke Tsuke (Tatsuya Nakadai).  Trained by his father, Ryunosuke has developed a unique style of swordplay that lulls his opponents in so he can chop them to ribbons.  This he does with great skill and no remorse.  Before he dies, Ryunosuke's father observes that his cruelty no longer stops with his sword but has seeped into his mind and body.Set in the Japan of the 1860s, after the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate, we first meet Ryunosuke when he kills an old pilgrim at a roadside shrine.  Clearly he is an evil figure, but he turns out to be the movie's protagonist.  Despite that pointed introduction, the precipitating act in ""The Sword of Doom"" is a match between Ryunosuke and another student at their fencing school.  But circumstances conspire for the match to become a duel, and Ryunosuke is forced to kill his opponent.  This signals an end to his time at the school and sends him on the road to hell.  Ultimately the character reminds me of Don Corleon's description of Luca Brazi in the original novel of ""The Godfather,"" as a man who was asking to be killed and for a long time finding no one up to the task.  I think that is why he seeks out Toranosuke Shimada (Toshir Mifune), who refuses to be baited into a fatal mistake.  The titles make it seem like Mifune is the co-star of the film, but he is really just a heavyweight guest star and if you anticipate that he and Ryunosuke are going to cross swords at the end of this one you will be sadly mistaken.  But Mifune does get one magnificent sword fight in the snow.We are able to ascribe a wide range of motives to Ryunosuke for his actions because he lets his sword speak for him.  Each death drives him deeper along his personal road and if who the victims are matters it is on a level beyond his consciousness.  Our understanding is only slightly better because we get to see move of those victims than does their killer, so we are aware of a rough justice that exists but of which he has no clue.  But none of that matters as Ryunosuke's face finally starts to change and the grin of a grim reaper appears.  Finally it all comes down, as it must, to the climatic sword fight after Ryunosuke comes full-circle and confronts the crime of the opening sequence.The initial impulse is to compare this samurai fight to other climatic samurai swords fights, but by the time this Criterion Collection DVD came out in 2005 the obvious cinematic reference point is the House of Blue Leaves sequence from ""Kill Bill, Volume 1,"" more in terms of the nonstop action that the over the top blood spraying.  Okamoto extends the sequence to a point beyond audacity and then pushes it all the way to the final frame.

197067,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,630015002X,magellan,"[9, 9]","This is a very dark and nihilistic story from director Okamoto about an evil swordsman whose passion for the sword becomes an all-consuming desire to destroy anyone who challenges him or stands in his way. His character may seem puzzling at first to western audiences more acquainted with the more famous movies from Kurosawa, where samurai are portrayed more positively, but the writer (unfortunately his name escapes me) whose book the movie was based on regarded himself as a student of such western authors as Dostoyevski and Victor Hugo, and their well-known self-destructive and nihilistic anti-heroes no doubt influenced his portrayal of Ryunosuke. There are also Japanese legends of evil swords possessing their owners. But in Ryunosuke's case, there is no doubt that an evil mind wields an evil sword.Ryunosuke's relationships with women are no better, and his dysfuctional marriage with his wife seems to concern him no more than all the hapless people he kills in the movie. His position there is a true swordsman should be true to his sword just as a woman would be to her chastity, and so he refuses to lose gracefully in a match to a friend's husband although it will mean ruin to him and his family if he loses. Ryunosuke, on the other hand, has nothing to lose since he holds no position with the local lord (although all the other swordsman realize they are no match for him).The movie skillfully weaves together several plot lines, such as his quest to kill the last Utsugi brother, what will happen when he finally meets Mifune's senior student in a duel, or possibily even Mifune itself. But the movie takes an unpexpected turn at the very end, when the evil swordsman's karma finally comes back to haunt him (literally). I won't say anymore so as to avoid any spoilers, but the ending wasn't what I expected.Interestingly, although Mifune and Nakadai are billed as the two top actors, you don't actually see Mifune until about halfway through the movie, where he's seen as the sword master presiding over some matches in his own school. He only really has one major scene, where he takes on several dozen swordsman in the snow, as Ryunosuke watches in awe--the first time he has ever seen another swordsman who was his equal or perhaps superior.Also, the shots of the samurai dueling in the heavy snow are pretty cool. I don't know if they were actually shooting during the winter or if they used snow making machines, but some of the snowflakes are the size of postage stamps. So there are some nice atmospheric touches as well. And Nakadai's ""drunken style"" swordsmanship (well, not exactly, but you'll see what I mean) and acting at the very end of the movie are superb. In fact, when he's not out and about accomplishing evil, he spends a lot of his time staring vacantly off into space with a convincingly looney/evil expression on his face.I actually enjoyed this movie in some ways more than the Kurosawa movies with Mifune. It's definitely done in a different style, and if you're a fan of samurai movies or of Japanese film, you'll probably want to see this one just because of how different it is from the other directors such as Kurosawa, Inagaki, and so on.",5,A different sort of samurai movie,1111190400,"03 19, 2005",2005,3190,"['very', 'dark', 'nihilistic', 'story', 'director', 'Okamoto', 'evil', 'swordsman', 'passion', 'sword', 'all-consuming', 'desire', 'destroy', 'anyone', 'who', 'stands', 'way', 'character', 'may', 'seem', 'puzzling', 'first', 'western', 'audiences', 'more', 'acquainted', 'more', 'famous', 'movies', 'Kurosawa', 'where', 'samurai', 'are', 'portrayed', 'more', 'positively', 'writer', 'unfortunately', 'name', 'book', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'regarded', 'student', 'such', 'western', 'authors', 'Dostoyevski', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'well-known', 'self-destructive', 'nihilistic', 'anti-heroes', 'doubt', 'influenced', 'portrayal', 'Ryunosuke', 'are', 'also', 'Japanese', 'legends', 'evil', 'swords', 'possessing', 'owners', 'Ryunosuke', 'case', 'doubt', 'evil', 'mind', 'evil', 'sword.Ryunosuke', 'relationships', 'women', 'are', 'better', 'dysfuctional', 'marriage', 'wife', 'concern', 'no', 'more', 'hapless', 'people', 'movie', 'position', 'true', 'swordsman', 'should', 'be', 'true', 'sword', 'just', 'woman', 'would', 'be', 'chastity', 'so', 'lose', 'gracefully', 'match', 'friend', 'husband', 'will', 'mean', 'ruin', 'family', 'Ryunosuke', 'other', 'hand', 'nothing', 'lose', 'position', 'local', 'lord', 'other', 'swordsman', 'realize', 'are', 'match', '.The', 'movie', 'skillfully', 'together', 'several', 'plot', 'lines', 'such', 'quest', 'kill', 'last', 'Utsugi', 'brother', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'when', 'finally', 'Mifune', 'senior', 'student', 'duel', 'possibily', 'even', 'Mifune', 'movie', 'unpexpected', 'turn', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'evil', 'swordsman', 'karma', 'finally', 'back', 'haunt', 'literally', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anymore', 'so', 'avoid', 'spoilers', 'ending', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'expected.Interestingly', 'Mifune', 'Nakadai', 'are', 'billed', 'two', 'top', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'see', 'Mifune', 'halfway', 'movie', 'where', 'seen', 'sword', 'master', 'presiding', 'matches', 'own', 'school', 'only', 'really', 'one', 'major', 'scene', 'where', 'several', 'dozen', 'swordsman', 'snow', 'Ryunosuke', 'watches', 'awe', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'seen', 'swordsman', 'who', 'was', 'equal', 'perhaps', 'superior.Also', 'shots', 'samurai', 'dueling', 'heavy', 'snow', 'are', 'pretty', 'cool', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'were', 'actually', 'shooting', 'winter', 'used', 'snow', 'making', 'machines', 'snowflakes', 'are', 'size', 'postage', 'stamps', 'are', 'nice', 'atmospheric', 'touches', 'as', 'well', 'Nakadai', 'drunken', 'style', 'swordsmanship', 'well', 'not', 'exactly', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'acting', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'superb', 'fact', 'when', 'not', 'out', 'accomplishing', 'evil', 'lot', 'time', 'staring', 'vacantly', 'space', 'convincingly', 'looney/evil', 'expression', 'face.I', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'ways', 'more', 'Kurosawa', 'movies', 'Mifune', 'definitely', 'done', 'different', 'style', ""'re"", 'fan', 'samurai', 'movies', 'Japanese', 'film', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'see', 'one', 'just', 'how', 'different', 'other', 'directors', 'such', 'Kurosawa', 'Inagaki', 'so']",Sword of Doom VHS

But I also agree with a few here, that the plot was woefully lacking. If the whole movie was about the journey of a tortured soul, then why bother with subplots which aren't resolved?Many minutes of the film are spent on the brother (Utsuki) and his quest for revenge - the fact that he never gets a chance for it is a HUGE letdown. Did he see the final battle inside the buring building? Did he witness the death of Ryunosuke? Did he deliver the final blow? If not, he just wasted 2 years of his life training and chasing Ryunosuke. (Also, whatever happened to the duel at 6:00am in the middle of the movie?)At least the Omatsu storyline was somewhat satisfying. Her story of her grandfather being killed is the final straw which sends Ryunosuke over the edge. However, did she escape the burining building alive? Did she meet up with Utsuki? Why bother giving her much screen time if her subplot is just cast away at the end?When I saw the words ""THE END"" in the middle of the final battle, I was left shocked. I firmly believe the director must have ran out of money or film stock. The ending ruined what was a thoroughly enjoyable movie. If the final image the director wanted was the crazed look of Ryunosuke fighting for his life, then fine - all I would've asked for is a short shot of the girl running out of the building into Utsuki's arms, and them watching the building burn. Then, it could have cut back to the battle and the final shot of Ryunosuke. An extra minute of film! Would that have been so difficult!?p.s. I don't think it's my ""Western sensibiltiy"" that calls for a movie to have a satisfying ending. It's common sense that any story needs to have its plot resolved.

I appreciated this as you need someone to bounce stuff off of.  Her opinion was of great value.How do I describe this film?  It has all of the obligatory items normally associated with a a bad Samurai flic.  These include revenge, betrayal, the required rape (and to make it better she becomes his live in common law wife), wandering plot line, new characters introduced throughout the movie, cultural differences incomprehensible to the western mind, no real difference between the good guys and the bad ones. It has gore in the extreme!  The TV dripped blood when it was over. To make it even better, they never seemed to know when they had made the point and continued the  fight scenes well past their natural ends.  Indeed, one would  expect that the end would close at least one of the multiple plot lines that hopped and skipped through the film.Japanese films are much like a Russian novel.  It's difficult to keep track of the characters.  If you end up liking one, you can bet that they will be mindlessly slaughtered in the next scene. The other feature is that the movie jumps from scene to scene in a confusing way.  Indeed, half the fun is trying to guess which scenes have any relevance to the actual story line.  In Sword of Doom, I'm not sure any of them did.  They set you up for the big fight at the end between the brother of the man that was killed near the beginning of the film and the villain.  Never happens.  NEVER HAPPENS!!!  I swear that they got to the end of the movie and just ran out of film.  They stopped the film one scene short of actually finishing the movie.  My daughter and I just sat there STUNNED!  She looked at me and said ""Thats it????"".  I have no idea what the point of the movie was. No idea at all!And to make it better, it does have a whore house in it as well as some kinky sword play.Some random plot points.Girl (#1) and grandfather making a pilgrimage stop  to rest on top of a mountain pass.  She goes for water, he prays to Buddha for Buddha to take him away so that his beloved granddaughter can find a man and have a better life.  The evil samurai shows up, hears the prayer and kills the guy to answer the prayer.  As evil guy walks away he bumps into a thief and takes a swing and a miss with his sword.Another woman (#2) meets evil guy and begs him to allow her husband to win the non lethal match scheduled the next day.  Her families honor is at stake.  He agrees to let him win IF she will have sex with him.  After the deed, somehow her husband finds out and divorces her.  The nonlethal match becomes lethal with evil guy killing the ex husband.  On the way out of town he kills most of the students at the local sword school.Next scene has  #2 shacking up with evil guy 2 years later.  She has had his baby.  Don't get used to this girl, she eventually tries to kill him and he then ends up killing her and the baby.In yet another sub plot, evil guy is looking for brother of dead hubby to kill him in order to prevent brother from seeking revenge.  He joins a conspiracy, and ends up watching all of the conspirators die at the hands of Toshiro Mfune (head of the sword school that  brother studies at) while he does nothing to help.  Brother sends a challenge, but evil guy loses his nerve and does not show.Woman #1 ends up being taken in to her uncles house, but while he is away, wife sells the whelp (#1) to the local Lord and chief pervert who likes to undress his dates with a sword.  She escapes only to be sold by wife again to a man who takes her to become a geisha in another city (Kyoto).Evil guy joins another conspiracy and they go to Kyoto.  He ends up killing most of that group while in the whore house, girl #1 who is in Geisha training dies.

The old man prayed to Buddha to die and the swordsman fulfilled his prayer.  Then his father tells him to throw the match so the other undeserving and underskilled swordsman could possess all appearances of being the great man.  Then the underskilled swordsman's wife offers herself to the doomed swordsman in exchange for the doomed swordsman throwing the fight.So the doomed swordsman threw the fight but the half-pint swordsman tries to kill him anyways.  The doomed swordsman protects himself and the other guy is rightfully killed.  But then all through the rest of the movie the event of the swordfight match is referred to as a basis for why the doomed swordsman is evil.

Author Nakazato Kaizan wrote eleven volumes worth of stories about his anti-hero Ryunosuke, but died before bringing the series to a conclusion-- leaving future generations to ponder what the author had in mind as a fitting end for the miscreant swordsman.The film covers the events of the first collected volume of Nakazato's epic, and leaves the fate of Ryunosuke unresolved, just as the novel does.  Kihachi opts for an 'existential dilemma' finale, rather than committing to a concrete interpretation of the series, which is something of a cop-out as the film did not become a series of its own despite critical praise.That said, director Okamoto Kihachi (highly regarded in Japan, but little-known abroad-- and largely a forgettable director) outdid himself with the direction and photography of this film, which is rendered in sparse black and white, and captures the nihilistic impulses of the erstwhile protagonist in an appropriate style, although strong if stone-faced performances go a long way toward achieving the effect.The interesting thing about the film is the absence of context among reviewers and critics.  The word 'samurai' is never uttered over the course of the film, matters of honor are never discussed, and the larger picture of the hollowness of the 'bushido' system vis a vis the decay of the Tokugawa shogunate is often ignored in favor of stereotypical admiration for imagined concepts of chivalry and devotion.  Not to mention the regrettable acknowledgment of women holding social power only through their sexuality (those who praise the film's appreciation of 'traditional values' are sadly misguided).More than anything, the film is a portrait of a once-proud caste system whose alleged superiors (the samurai) find themselves more than willing to accept the role desperate street gangs, with no more ambition than expanding their 'turf' and becoming successful extortionists-- the only way to continue making a living in a society that's leaving them behind.Sword of Doom is nicely photographed and sturdily directed, but without awareness of the origin of the story and the historical context, it may leave some viewers baffled.  Or worse, promote the glorification of the legendary samurai during a period of Japanese society when they were little more than brutal thugs.Body count: about 100, give or take.  The violence in Japanese films tends to be a bit cartoonish, and the protagonist offs about forty people during the climactic scene alone.  It's a very violent film, but the violence is stylized to the point of self-parody, with a few gruesome exceptions near the end of the film.",3,The Japanese 'Unforgiven.'

197086,A1Z5G4IOUD4B3Z,630015002X,W. LEE,"[5, 17]","As a martial arts film connoisseur, I was quite anxious to buy this film based on the reviews I have read here. My introduction into Asian cinema came in the 1970's, as it was with most black kids, Bruce Lee and Hong Kong Chop Sockeys were my entr&eacute;e into this wonderful world of film making. Over the past few years, I have begun to dig deeper into the vast well of Japanese Samurai cinema. In the years between the 70's and now, Chinese cinema has actually made it's way closer to Japanese traditional cinema, so lines have been blurred, and what was old is new once again.Having said that, I have to say I was a bit let down by this film. The cinematography, acting and story lines were first rate. No argument there. However, this played More like a soap opera than it did a true revenge flick. Not to say there's anything wrong with it, but I have to laugh at the reviewers who are warning of the ""bloody fight scenes"". In my humble opinion, even the inferior fight scenes of Jimmy Wang Yu in films like ""One Armed Swordsman"" are bloodier and more action packed than the scenes depicted here. Again, it's probably just a matter of taste, but yes, i prefer the high pitched scenarios of ""Lone Wolf and Cub"", and films of that ilk. However, ""Seven Samurai"" is also a favorite of mine, which begs the question: is the difference in opinion on this film based on character development? The lead ""hero"" of this film is so unlikeable, I just found it hard to follow his journey with any interest or feeling. He's also not that skilled a swordsman, or perhaps just ""so good"" we can't see his expertise, and we, the expectant viewers, must settle for the results-men dying by unseen sword strokes, and his explanation of things like the ""Tsuki thrust"". Whoopee! Uh, sorry bro. Not buying it. Show me some fighting skills.What? I am to assume he's magnificent just because we are ""told"" so? PUHLEASE!At one point in the film, he actually annoys me to the point I have to turn off the DVD and resume it days later.Perhaps, in retrospect, that is where the film succeeds. An anti-hero who disgusts us so much, the effect becomes very very visceral.Oh well, I'll continue to watch and re watch this to see if my initial impressions hold true over time.

197087,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,630015002X,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[4, 6]","SWORD OF DOOM (1966, known in Japan as Incident at Daibatsu Pass) is a film directed by Kihachi Okamoto; responsible for acclaimed chambara films such as ""Red Lion"" and ""Zatoichi meets Yojimbo"". The film is based on the novel by Kaizan Nakazaro; ""Daibatsu Tage"", and this film still stands out as one of the most violent, dark epic tale even in today's standards. Please note that the novel has also been adapted into a trilogy called ""Daibatsu"" (Satan's sword) which presents a more detailed representation of its characters and premise. ""Sword of Doom's"" main focus is the story of a young samurai named Ryunosuke Tsukure, his beliefs, skills and ruthless indignation.The backdrop of the film is the 1860's, a period where the Shogunate is slowly taking over and the samurai clans are desperately clinging to their power. The hero or anti-hero is a grim young man named Ryunosuke who is a cold, emotionless master swordsman who trusts no one but his steel. We are introduced to Ryunosuke when he cuts down an old man on a pilgrimage with his daughter when he overhears him asking for his own death for her sake. Ryunosuke arrives to his father's bedside to be scolded because of his ways with the use of his sword, he is scheduled for an exhibition match with a man who is supposed to assume the role of instructor in a school. Ohama (Michiyo Aratama), his wife meets with Ryunosuke to ask him to throw the match in exchange for her body. On the time of the friendly exhibition, the match becomes a duel to the death. What follows next is a downward spiral to murder and madness...Ryunosuke (Tatsuya Nakadai)seems like evil incarnate, actually he resembles a demon more than a human being when it comes to character. Ryunosuke is a cold heartless killer, but if the viewer pays extra attention, the anti-hero of this film actually kills for self defense and political reasons. You may say that he's never killed anyone who didn't deserve it, but it`s the manner in which he engages his opponents and kills his victims. Ryunosuke never gets to express his motivations and background as to why he is the way he is. I believe this is a clever idea to keep his character at arm's length from the audience. It promotes a morbid, dark and chilling aura from the lead character almost up to a supernatural level. His presence his disquietingly intimidating and mysteriously evil.The swordplay in the film is excellent, it is quick, bloody and never loses any of its visceral punch. The encounter with Ohama's husband is a near-perfect example of a Kendo match, as each of them takes their time to look for an opening. The viewer will realize that the match becomes lethal when they change their form, Ryunosuke assumes his signature ""Silent stance"" in which he slowly lowers his sword and his opponent raise his in a high stance.Toshiro Mifune makes a limited but worthwhile appearance as Swordmaster Shimada. Although he never crosses swords with Ryunosuke, the incident in a bridge or pass where he cuts down Rynosuke's associates is fantastic. Mifune displays his acting ability in this extended swordplay which is excellently choreographed. Shimada spews out his righteous indignation and philosophy while cutting down his assailants, that leads even the ""hero"" of this film to doubt his beliefs after he hears ""know the sword, know the mind..."". It is rather unclear as to why Ryunosuke decided against the idea of engaging Shimada in combat; perhaps because his band made a mistake in the attack, that Shimada wasn't their intended victim, or is it something more? Whatever the cause, it will change him forever.The cinematography of the film is quite enthralling. Even with its colorless sequences (it is in Black and White), the music and camera work are very well-executed and way ahead in its time. Toho productions is well known in awesome production values in 1966 that it came as no surprise. Okamoto's direction is almost flawless as he portrays the lead as dark, foreboding presence that exudes violence and death, much similar to an angel of darkness. I was rather disappointed that the sub-plots regarding Hyoma's (Yuzo Kayama)intended vengeance and his budding romance with a pretty young courtesan named Omatsu (Yoko Naito)never came to fruition and effective closure. The climax is satisfying enough on an action standpoint but it did leave some questions unanswered. It opted to focus its sights on Ryunosuke's descent into madness, on a killing spree, cutting down everyone in his path while being haunted by the `ghosts' of his empty past.Ultimately, you will be led to conclude that an ""evil soul is an evil sword"", that gestures, whether good or bad, are what makes a man. Action defines the essence of a human being. On this aspect, ""Sword of Doom"" succeeds hands down. Murder and violence can eat a man up from inside, no matter how cold and ruthless one may be. It will extinguish a man from the inside...Highest Possible Recommendation!

197089,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,630015002X,Zack Davisson,"[19, 20]","""The Sword of Doom"" (""Dai-bosatsu Toge"" or ""Pass of the Great Bodhisattva "") is entirely unlike most films in the Samurai genre.  Harder than most, crueler than most, and certainly more bloody than any other Samurai film from this time period, it is a difficult film to define and for some impossible to enjoy.At first, the plot seems straight forward.  An outcast Samurai,  Ryunosuke enters into a match with Bunnojo Utsuki, upstanding member of the fencing school where Ryunosuke was expelled from.  Defending himself from an illegal attack, Ryunosuke kills Bunnojo.  Bunnojo's brother, Hyoma, vows revenge and begins to train himself to be strong enough to kill the powerful Ryunosuke.  Into this revenge-motif there are added elements of the Shinsengumi army of Kyoto, and the Shogun loyalists, as well as a pair of women seeking to find their place in a dangerous world.However, nothing else of ""The Sword of Doom"" is straight forward.  Ryunosuke is a sociopath, an emotionless killer of almost-supernatural skills with his sword.  His motivations are cloudy, and sheer momentum seems to be his driving force.  It is easy to label him a villain, yet it cannot be denied that each of his kills are justified, and he himself does not seek death.  Hyoma's vendetta against Ryunosuke is almost pathetic, as it is obvious he would only die in the challenge.  He struggles to gain an advantage, but the outcome is never in doubt.  Fencing school master Toranosuke Shimada (Mifune Toshiro) is a bridge between the two men, being the only one skillful enough to give Ryunosuke pause, he trains Hyoma.  In the background are the political motivations of the Shogun-loyalists, whom hire Ryunoske to kill for them.Tatsuya Nakadai is incredible as Ryunoske, a driven, intense performance.  Nakadai is a veteren of many famous Samurai films, being the gunslinger in ""Yojimbo"" and the honorable Hanshiro Tsugumo in ""Seppuku.""  Mifune is a stand-out as well, although his role is small.  He exudes the necessary charisma to challenge Ryunoske.An action film, a psychology play, an art film...""The Sword of Doom"" could be considered any of these.  Definitely a ""Love it or Hate it"" movie, with emphatic opinions on both sides, it is an important entry in the Samurai genre, and everyone should give themselves a chance to see in what camp they fall.
