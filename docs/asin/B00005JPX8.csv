Edith Piaf (Marion Cotillard) had two things in life that she treasured: love and singing. This Biopic French movie deftly hop-scotches between several time frames, giving us a composite of her life.Rose had to grow up quickly and early, for custody was an unstable affair where she could be brought up by her mother, a street singer; her father, a circus performer; or her grandmother, Titune, who resided at a brothel. The breaks are few and far between. Later, hitting the street with friend, Simone, they make ends meet in the thirties as street singers getting tips in a wealthy Paris neighborhood. Misfortunes mix with her rise as a singing sensation, but she finds solace with her music and her champagne. As a respite she has a torrid, yet tender affair with Marcel, a Morrocan boxer and pig farmer, who makes her an adulterous interest.Featuring an expert portrayal by Cotillard, the movie has a stature and fluidity of an epic. Before the film gets too heavy handed with heartache, there are captivating scenes that resonate with the glory and glamour of her art, especially showing the spell she casts on her audience. There's no question that if this movie was made in America, it would be a Best Film Oscar contender.",5,Film of a Lifetime,1191715200,"10 7, 2007",2007,1319,"['Just', 'singer', 'La', 'Vie', 'en', 'Rose', 'magical', 'vivacious', 'entertainment', 'Edith', 'Piaf', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'had', 'two', 'things', 'life', 'treasured', 'love', 'singing', 'Biopic', 'French', 'movie', 'deftly', 'hop-scotches', 'several', 'time', 'frames', 'giving', 'composite', 'life.Rose', 'had', 'grow', 'up', 'quickly', 'early', 'custody', 'was', 'unstable', 'affair', 'where', 'could', 'be', 'brought', 'up', 'mother', 'street', 'singer', 'father', 'circus', 'performer', 'grandmother', 'Titune', 'who', 'resided', 'brothel', 'breaks', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'Later', 'hitting', 'street', 'friend', 'Simone', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'thirties', 'street', 'singers', 'getting', 'tips', 'wealthy', 'Paris', 'neighborhood', 'Misfortunes', 'mix', 'rise', 'singing', 'sensation', 'solace', 'music', 'champagne', 'respite', 'torrid', 'yet', 'tender', 'affair', 'Marcel', 'Morrocan', 'boxer', 'pig', 'farmer', 'who', 'adulterous', 'interest.Featuring', 'expert', 'portrayal', 'Cotillard', 'movie', 'stature', 'fluidity', 'epic', 'film', 'too', 'heavy', 'handed', 'heartache', 'are', 'captivating', 'scenes', 'resonate', 'glory', 'glamour', 'art', 'especially', 'showing', 'spell', 'audience', 'question', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'America', 'would', 'be', 'Best', 'Film', 'Oscar', 'contender']",La Vie en Rose

Her body language during the final sick and weary years is amazing.  I'm hoping Oscar nomination and the statuette itself for her.  Unlike most entertainer bio-pics, this one jumps back and forth in time constantly, but we always get the dates of locales to explain where we are and when it is happening.  I've always heard Piaf referred to as The French Judy Garland, and I can see why now.  Even when she seems to be dying, she goes out onstage and tries to sing for her faithful fans, sometimes triumphing.  (It reminds me of the Diana Ross performance in ""Lady Sings the Blues,"" although Cotillard is lip-synching the songs here.)

Abandoned by both her parents and growing up in a brothel--to singing on the streets of Paris--the movie tells Edith's story, mostly in flashback, as she fights against poverty, ill health and heartbreak to become the french chanteuse known the world over.I enjoyed the movie and the music, but I do agree with another reviewer about the lack of subtitles on the songs. Because the songs are played at key points in the movie, my guess to punctuate the scene, the emotional punch is gone if you don't understand french. That's why I give only four-stars. Other than that, the film is really good.I don't know what the extended scene is, since I did not see this in the theater, but the dvd has a featurette showing Oscar winning actress Marion Cotillard and director Olivier Dahan as they prepare her for the character.LA VIE EN ROSE is definitely enjoyable whether or not you're an Edith Piaf fan.",4,Gripping Bio of the ***Sparrow***,1207612800,"04 8, 2008",2008,992,"['LA', 'VIE', 'EN', 'ROSE', 'dvd', 'intriguing', 'look', 'tumultuous', 'life', 'career', 'Edith', 'Piaf', 'Abandoned', 'parents', 'growing', 'up', 'brothel', 'singing', 'streets', 'Paris', 'movie', 'Edith', 'story', 'mostly', 'flashback', 'poverty', 'ill', 'health', 'heartbreak', 'become', 'french', 'chanteuse', 'known', 'world', 'over.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'music', 'do', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'lack', 'subtitles', 'songs', 'songs', 'are', 'played', 'key', 'points', 'movie', 'guess', 'punctuate', 'scene', 'emotional', 'punch', 'gone', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'french', 'why', 'give', 'only', 'four-stars', 'Other', 'film', 'really', 'good.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'extended', 'scene', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'theater', 'dvd', 'featurette', 'showing', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'actress', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'director', 'Olivier', 'Dahan', 'prepare', 'character.LA', 'VIE', 'EN', 'ROSE', 'definitely', 'enjoyable', 'not', ""'re"", 'Edith', 'Piaf', 'fan']",La Vie en Rose

At her funeral, over 80,000 people were at the cemetery with 400,000 in the streets.

657882,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JPX8,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 9]","I will say first and foremost that I did enjoy this film.  It's beautiful to look at, truly mesmerizing at times, and it does sport one of the year's most iconic performances.  Yes, Marion Cotillard will be nominated for the Oscar (watch AMPA's make me a liar) and, in my humble opinion, should win.  I must admit though that `La Vie En Rose' (or `La Mome') is a deeply flawed film that falls short in many other areas not concerning Cotillard's brilliant portrayal of Edith Piaf.  I am a sucker for a biopic, and one of this nature was very intriguing for me.  The tortured life of a very inspirational singer; now I know this has been done before (`Ray', `Walk the Line') but there was something about the feeling I got from watching clips of this film that led me to believe this one could be outright amazing.  It had the makings for a superb film but there are a few things that tragically cut this film at the knees.Alright, so I guess I'll get the negative out of the way first.  The editing of this film is a complete mess.  I understand the whole `shifting timeframes' idea and I even encourage it at times (`21 Grams' is still one of my favorite films) but in `La Vie En Rose' it is just confusing.  One minute Edith is five, the next in her forties (although she looks eighty), the next she's ten, then in her twenties...so on and so forth.  It gets very jumbled.  In fact there was a scene where she was forty and I didn't even know it was her and it wasn't until her next `forty' scene where I realized that old lady I saw before was Edith.  The idea of jumping back and forth between timelines is not a bad one, but it needs to have some structure.  These time shifts seem unnecessary really and it takes away from the overall feeling of the film.Another negative is the fact that unless you really know a lot about Edith's life you will be completely lost at times.  I think this is also a culprit of the `time shifts' but there is so much being thrown at you at once it's easy to start wondering what is actually going on.  It took me forever to understand what was making Edith so ill, and I still am not completely sure that I fully grasped it all (feel free if you caught that or just know to comment here and let me know as I am curious if my assumption was correct).Edith's life was, in fact, one big negative, or at least that is how it is painted here.  Each and every blessing she received did not come without a price.  There are moments within the film where she seems happy none-the-less only to have it stripped from her in the most devastating of ways.  The film is over two hours in length yet I'm tempted to suggest it had been longer.  There is just so much crammed into this film that it seems short.  When it ended I found myself confused that that was all there was for I was certain there was more of her story to tell.Okay, these things aside the film is worth your time, and I'll tell you why.  Marion Cotillard consumes Edith Piaf, becoming the legendary singer from her voice (speaking voice, for she does no singing in the film) to her appearance to her walk (ha, and you think Helen Mirren had The Queen down-pat).  Piaf was an eccentric woman so the complaints about Cotillard being too outlandish or melodramatic are completely unjustified.  Cotillard magically manages to shift from nave and incecure to confident and even catty to fragile and weak, all the while making herself completely vulnerable to the audience and thus conveying real, raw and believable emotions.In fact, Cotillard's performance has been the one I was most anxious to see from the beginning of the year and I must say that I was not let down.  Her performance is everything the many, many critics have built it up to be...sheer brilliance.The rest of the cast though is just as impressive.  In fact not one performance is sub-par.  Sadly most other actors receive very little screen time, but the all make an impact, none more so than the men in Edith's life.  Gerard Depardieu does a fantastic portrayal of Louis Leplee, the man who first discovered Edith.  There is a scene where she auditions for him and the look on his face is golden to me.  You can read everything this man is thinking, the way he is intoxicated by her voice.  Jean-Pierre Martins also nails his part as Marcel Cerdan, the married boxer whom Edith has a heated affair.  He is her rock, her meaning and purpose and he beautifully embodies that personification.So, I will recommend `La Vie En Rose' but with reservations.  It is not a great biopic, but is more a canvas for which Cotillard and company paint their performances magnificently.  It is flawed in its execution but soars with its many splendid performances.  So watch `La Vie En Rose' and come to your own conclusions (many love this movie, many hate it...I fall in the middle) but do watch it, for everyone should see Cotillard's performance for themselves...that way when Forest Whitaker takes the stage to announce this years `Best Actress in a Leading Role' we can all be rooting for the rightful winner.",3,While the film on its own is deeply flawed it's moved forward by many dynamic performances...,1196121600,"11 27, 2007",2007,5060,"['will', 'say', 'first', 'foremost', 'did', 'enjoy', 'film', 'beautiful', 'look', 'truly', 'mesmerizing',

657884,A1DZU4AQR7KD9R,B00005JPX8,"Axton Blessendon, Jr.","[3, 3]","This is a marvelous film about an extremely talented, charismatic and complicated, difficult person -- a true artist whose suffering informed her art and helped shape her fame.  France adored Piaf because she truly lived the hard times and heartache she sang about.  Like the cabaret star Frehel, who came before her, Piaf came out of utter poverty and lived in the lower rungs of society, but was raised up from the gutter both by the sheer force of her talent, and by blind luck.  (Early in the film, a parallel is made between Piaf and the star-crossed jazz icon Billie Holiday, who also grew up in rough circumstances and who also fell prey to many of the same troubles as Piaf -- poor choices in love, drug addiction and failing health.)Great praise has been lavished on actress Marion Cotillard, and all of it is deserved, as she really inhabits the role in a way that is sadly rare in this type of biopic.  (Contrast this performance to Philip Seymour Hoffman's award-winning role as Truman Capote: Cotillard lives her part, while Hoffman merely  xeroxed the mannerisms of his subject...)  Kudos must also be given to the film's director and production design team, who did a fabulous job evoking the world of Belle Epoque and inter-war France, particularly in their recreation of the rough-and-tumble, frequently dangerous world of the music-halls where Piaf learned her craft.All in all, a fine film...

The actress creates a character full of passion and tragedy and her performance is perhaps the best transformation I have seen on film in many a year. Her performance begs for the Oscar and her nomination was well deserved.With all that said, is this a great film? The movie holds its viewers attention but the story lags at points and not enough time is spent on the glory years that Piaf experienced in the 1940's. The film's strange story telling technique of flashbacks and flash  forewards may be off putting to the casual viewer. In addition as biopics go this film seems overly heavy and sometimes depressing. The film will do much better with an audience familiar with Piaf's life and music than it will with someone who does not share this interest. La Vie en Rose works more as arthouse fare than it does as a general release film.A problem with the presentation also mars the end result.

As a lover of all things French, and after seeing Marion Cotillard win the Academy Award for her performance as Edith Piaf, I placed this movie on my Wish List and received it as a gift.If ever anyone deserved an Academy Award it is Marion Cotillard!  This beautiful young French woman played Miss Piaf through all ages and stages of infirmity to perfection.  She ""became"" Edith Piaf, which gave life to the film.  Because of Marion Cotillard this movie haunts me still.At times I had to strain a little to see, as many of the scenes are dark; however, the darkness parallels Edith's life.  The story moves back and forth through time, and sometimes details are not provided, which makes it difficult to follow at times.  None of this was especially problematic to me, since the movie is well worth seeing.  Due to her poor health throughout her life, and the automobile accidents she survived, Edith suffered from severe and crippling arthritis. The scenes where Miss Piaf, at 4 ft. 8 inches, shuffles on stage in severe pain because of her great drive to sing, were highly inspirational to ones such as myself who also suffer from the disease.  The strength and purity of Miss Piaf's singing throughout this film, along with the emotionality of her delivery, is entirely unique and exceptional!  After viewing the movie I immediately purchased two of her cd's, which I thoroughly enjoy, and treasure.I would suggest that if you plan to see this film you search the Internet beforehand and read a few reputable biographies of Miss Piaf to fill in any gray areas.  I also suggest that you watch the bonus features on the disc.  It was fascinating to see the transformation of this lovely actress into the varied ages and physical qualities of her unique character.

This film will have you on an emotional roller-coaster from start to finish. There is much tragedy here interwoven with the incredible music of Piaf. Marion Cotillard plays the rebellious street-wise Edith, the super-star Edith, and the decrepit Edith falling apart in her alcoholism and addiction. Cotillard's performance is great and she captures each stage of Piaf's life to perfection.The film follows a trajectory of exploring Edith's tragic childhood, her rise to fame and fortune, and her physical downfall. Edith was taken from her homeless and mentally ill mother and placed in a brothel run by her father's mother. Here she plays with the prostitutes and becomes especially attached to Titine, a young prostitute who bonds strongly with the motherless Edith. Edith becomes blind with an infection of the eyes which eventually heals. She is taken from the brothel to be a circus performer with her father. Here she is exposed to the entertainment business. She eventually earns a living singing in the streets with her lesbian tom-boy street partner. She is discovered by Louis Leplee (played so very well by Gerard Depardieu) the nightclub owner. Unfortunately he is murdered by the criminal elements that surround Edith from her days living in the streets with prostitutes and junkies.Edith's career is also explored and she becomes a mega-star with loads of talent and loads of attitude. As her fame grows, so does the crowd of old losers, some of which she ejects from her new life. She becomes lovers with boxer Marcel Cerdan (played by the extremely handsome Jean-Pierre Martins) but he is already married and will not divorce his wife for Edith. The scene where Edith believes Marcel has flown to see her is one of the most powerful scenes in the film. The camera follows Edith as she runs around her apartment, trying to find Marcel and wondering why everyone around her is crying.Her downfall is also documented and portrayed in the film. We see her frail tiny body begin to wear out from too many parties, too much alcohol, and addiction to heroin.Well, so much for the tragedy. The performances of Piaf's music are stellar and a wonderful aspect of the film. Cotillard lip-syncs the songs of Piaf and these works are strategically placed throughout the film for dramatic effect. The film's art direction is also superb, capturing the warm earth tones of Paris.In summary, you will be highly entertained by the dramatic and sad life that this tiny woman encountered as she struggles to survive with the incredible gift of her amazing voice.",5,What a life!

She went from a street singer to one of the most beloved singers in France, and whatever she seemed to be looking for on the way she never found.  She had a certain humility, at least in the earlier part of her career, which was wonderfully demonstrated in a short scene where Marlene Deitrich met her and praised her.  Edith was so in awe of this woman that she was unable to speak, and one has the impression that this praise meant more to her than all the applause she got from her audiences.Looking at clips of the real Edith Piaf on You Tube, and from my own remembrances of her, Marion Cotillard transformed herself into an exact replica of the singer.  She did an excellent job of acting from the look to the posture to the mannerisms of Edith Piaf.Watching this movie one can only feel the sadness of Edith Piaf, with too, too brief moments of joy.

DeRiemer,"[227, 238]","I wouldn't be comfortable calling La Vie en Rose (La Mome), the life of Edith Piaf, one of the great biographical films until I have a chance to see it once or twice more. What I'm sure of is that Marion Cotillard's portrayal of Piaf from Piaf's early teens until Piaf died at 47 is one of the most extraordinary performances I've ever seen on a movie screen. Piaf had an extraordinary life, was an extraordinary personality as well as being perhaps France's greatest singer. Cotillard simply remakes herself into this willful, self-destructive, selfish, generous, melodramatic, tiny creature -- Piaf was only 4' 8"" tall -- of dramatic vocal genius.Piaf grew up on the streets of Paris. Her life was one crises after another, some of her making, some not. We meet her as a child, when her mother abandoned her. Her father, a soldier in WWI and a contortionist in small traveling circuses, disappeared for long period of time. At one point before puberty she lived for quite a while with her paternal grandmother, who ran a brothel. She helped her father work at one of those circuses. They survived as street entertainers in Paris. She finally had enough and struck out on her own, making a little money singing on the streets, giving much of it to a local pimp for protection. She had a child who died of meningitis. When she was 20 she was discovered by an ""impresario"" who ran a nightclub. Louis Leplee renamed her Piaf. When he was murdered in what seemed to be a gang hit, she was put through the public wringer by the police and the French press. Her fame grew. During WWII she agreed to sing at POW camps so the French prisoners could be photographed with Piaf by the Germans as evidence of how happy the prisoners were. Piaf was a member of the Resistance. She took copies of the photographs and arranged for the Resistance to make false passports for 150 prisoners. She returned to the camps with the passports and managed to have them distributed to the prisoners under the eyes of the Germans. She was either fearless or willfully fatalistic. The Germans never seemed to realize what this tiny, internationally known singer was doing. After the war, she was acclaimed. She had famous love affairs, including Yves Montand and French middleweight boxer Marcel Cerdan. Cerdan, whom she loved, was killed in a plane crash. She drank heavily, took drugs, and her health continued to deteriorate. She suffered from rheumatism, severe arthritis, a liver that barely functioned. She became addicted to morphine and continued to drink heavily.And she sang and sang and sang. She could make a child's jump-rope song sound like an obsession to lost love. Piaf had a big voice and she knew how to use it. She preferred simple black dresses and a spotlight when she performed, creating a highly dramatic image of this small, sad face and her two expressive hands. Her songs were about love, loss, death, memories, hope that was glimmering and hope that had died. She had a vibrato that seemed to throb in the heart. When she died at 47, the drink and the drugs, the losses and tragedies, the self-destructive willfulness and the arthritis had turned her into the ruined shell of the teen-ager who sang on Paris streets. Not a life I would have wanted, even if I'd traded for her talent, but it was her life and it became a huge melodrama powered by her unique voice.For Americans, perhaps her most familiar song is La Vie En Rose. With Mack David's soppy lyrics, there was a time when it couldn't be avoided, including Piaf's French version. But the song that evokes the most memories, and the one that closes the movie and summarizes her life, is the song Piaf first sang just three years before her death, ""Non, je ne regrette rien.""Non, rien de rien,Non, je ne regrette rien,Ni le bien qu'on m'a fait,Ni le mal, tout a m'est bien &eacute;gal.Non, rien de rien,Non, je ne regrette rien,C'est pay&eacute;, balay&eacute;, oubli&eacute;,Je me fous du pass&eacute;...The song roughly translates as ""I don't regret a thing. What has happened has happened and has been paid for. Neither the good done to me, nor the bad;to me, they're all the same. No, I regret nothing. Because my life, because my joys, today, begin with you.""The movie La Vie en Rose is dramatically and almost lushly photographed. We don't have a simple linear story line; we keep moving back and forth among the times of her life. The juxtapositions between the child, the girl, the young woman, the star, the prematurely aged force of talent and willfulness, makes us need to pay attention but it also gives us some idea of the chaos of her life. Marion Cotillard is incredible as she makes us believe in this self-destructive and fascinating person. We really forget about Cotillard and can only focus on this tiny body, big voice and an odd, appealing face made up of huge eyes, blood red lips, and plucked, thin-lined eye-brows.Personally, self-destruction after awhile makes me impatient and irritated. There are too many things to do to waste one's life on a diet of willfulness and selfishness, even if one is gifted with huge talent. I was mesmerized by Piaf, her life and her songs, but at times I felt like telling her to ease up on the drama. I suppose, given her life, much should be forgiven or at least understood. As Roger Ebert has said, ""Nothing in her early life taught her to count on permanence or loyalty. What she counted on was singing, champagne, infatuation and morphine.""

When it was over, all I could mutter was ""wow!"" It makes me want to know more about Piaf.In addition to the great cinematography, the story was terrific, an extremely powerful one. I can't believe how mesmerizing Marion Cotillard was in the lead role of ""Edith Piaf.""""Props"" also for (1) Tetsuo Nagata's photography; (2) Cotillard's acting and her incredibly big-and-sad eyes which made Edith look unique; (3) the voice of Piaf. What a singer! Thankfully, we get to hear a lot of her songs in here; (4) Oliver Dahan's superb direction, and (5) the emotional story, which keeps you riveted to the screen for over two hours.Kudos also to the makeup department, which did an incredible job of transforming Cotillard into someone who looked a lot older than her years,. and  to the two little girls who played Edith as a 5-year-old (Marion Chevalier) and as a 10-year-old (Pauline Burlet). They, too, were terrific.Yes, there are flaws and/or puzzling omissions. I was surprised the World War II years were totally bypassed and that Piaf losing her child was almost an afterthought near the end of the film. That should have been a bigger part of her story. However, people have to realize that one can't cover everything in a famous person's biography in just a 140-minute film.

I have had a long interest in Edith Piaf so it was astonishing to see Marion Cotillard transformed into the singer.  But more than a physical resemblance she becomes Piaf in a way that is rare for an actress: she takes on the same emotional life.  She has all of Piaf's gestures and lip-synchs so closely that I believed she Ms. Cotillard was performing.  The supporting cast members were also very memorable:  Jean-Pierre Martins as Marcel Cerdan was absolutely charming and quite believable in his boxing scenes and Gerard Depardieu was equally good as Louis Leplee.  The caliber of performances, even for the very small parts was phenomenal.Writer/director Olivier Dahan has created a masterpiece of a biography with wonderful art direction that makes you truly feel that you are in France. His direction of Ms. Cotillard was something to behold and Piaf's death scene is something that I doubt that I will ever forget for its touching naturalism.  I must confess that the jumping from time period to time period was a bit abrupt at times and also difficult to follow, particularly the scene concerning Piaf's child.  I was wondering if someone would portray Jean Cocteau, and it is sad that their close friendship was not included in the film (I suppose one could make a film just on their friendship), particularly since they died hours apart.

Musical biograghy is a tricky proposition that if done improperly can border on the cliched.  Director Olivier Dahan's film has an interesting structure.  Though told in mostly linear fashion he ingeniously uses jumps in time to comment on the action.  What I also liked about this disc is it eschewed subtitles for the songs.  Even if you don't know a lick of French you don't need a translation to feel the power of the songs.  Marion Cotillard deservedly won an Oscar for her portrait of a woman who despite personal trials and tribulations held her head high and perservered through her music.  Cotillard is masterful in her transformation from a young girl to a middle-aged woman who, through debilitating infirmity, has to trudge through life yet still maintain her dignity.  The film's make-up people won an Oscar and deservedly so.  That said, I think Cotillard could have suggested the required physical transformations of Piaf without the use of prosthetics.

Like Billy Holiday, she possessed that special voice, that sorrowful gaze, the special loneliness that made her art very appealing. When the life story is told, however, one is asked to sympathize with her as a person, not only as a singer. For me, this was difficult.

657904,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JPX8,Ed Uyeshima,"[8, 10]","Virtually unrecognizable from her previous film roles, usually as a comely presence in films likeA Good Year, Marion Cotillard turns in such a viscerally transcendent performance as legendary chanteuse &Eacute;dith Piaf that she elevates this 2007 French biopic into a worthwhile piece of cinema. Otherwise, the film meanders back and forth through Piaf's life at such an agitated pace that the result, while evocative, is erratic and clich&eacute;-driven. Director Olivier Dahan (who also co-wrote the screenplay with Isabelle Sobelman) seems to get carried away with the melodramatic aspects of her life, so much so that Piaf comes across less as a three-dimensional person and more like a predictably self-destructive diva making up for a severely lacking childhood. The archetype is familiar from any number of similar celebrity portraits fromCoal Miner's DaughtertoRay, though the film reminds me most of Sidney J. Furie's episodicLady Sings the Blues. That's because Piaf and the equally ill-fated Billie Holiday are kindred spirits, a comparison brought up pointedly in the film. In fact, for a French film, it reflects a distinctively Hollywood-style sensibility, and Dahan punctuates every dramatic moment with such a repetitive sense of crescendo that it becomes wearing over its epic-length running time of 141 minutes.A lot of time in the film is spent on Piaf's miserable childhood when her drunken mother, an aspiring singer, abandons her, and her father, a traveling circus performer, leaves &Eacute;dith in a brothel run by her business-like grandmother. A prostitute named Titine grows fond of &Eacute;dith and takes care of her when she is blinded temporarily by keratitis. Following her mother's footsteps and accompanied by her confidante Momone, &Eacute;dith sings on the streets of Paris, and her remarkable voice impresses local nightclub impresario Louis Lepl&eacute;e. When she takes the stage at his club, her fate is secure. The rest of her story is told through disconnected dramatic episodes, although the film spends some extended time on her fateful affair with world-class boxer Marcel Cerdan. Under the masterful make-up work of Didier Lavergne and Jan Archibald, Cotillard is completely convincing whether as a gawky young teen or as the dying, hunchbacked woman looking decades older than the singer's 47 years. She is true to Piaf's spirit in the musical performances and lip-syncs with emotional precision. She has a particularly impressive five-minute scene - a single, uninterrupted take that ends with her character facing tragic news.Not too surprisingly, the rest of the cast is overshadowed by Cotillard's performance, but a few leave lasting impressions, such as G&eacute;rard Depardieu as Lepl&eacute;e, Emmanuelle Seigner as Titine, and Manon Chevallier and Pauline Burlet as &Eacute;dith at ages five and ten. The same can't be said for the pallid work of Jean-Pierre Martins as Cerdan and Caroline Sihol in a thankless cameo as Marlene Dietrich, one of Piaf's most fervent admirers. However, Piaf's voice is effectively presented for another generation to admire with her most famous songs showcased - ""La vie en rose"", ""Hymne &agrave; l'amour"", ""Milord"", and the masterpiece of her twilight years, ""Non, je ne regrette rien"". Moreover, most of the production values are first-rate, especially Marit Allen's period costumes and Olivier Raoux's production design. Tetsuo Nagata's cinematography is expert, although the use of low lighting during the childhood sequences seems excessive to me. The 2007 DVD has only one extra, a seven-minute making-of featurette mainly focused on Cotillard's tireless work in transforming herself into Piaf. I would have liked more information on Piaf herself to help elucidate some of the dramatic flourishes that Dahan brought to his film.",3,Cotillard Soars as the Little Sparrow Even When the Film Itself Lets Her Down,1201478400,"01 28, 2008",2008,3821,"['Virtually', 'unrecognizable', 'previous', 'film', 'roles', 'usually', 'comely', 'presence', 'films', 'likeA', 'Good', 'Year', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'such', 'viscerally', 'transcendent', 'performance', 'legendary', 'chanteuse', 'Eacute', 'Piaf', '2007', 'French', 'biopic', 'worthwhile', 'piece', 'cinema', 'Otherwise', 'film', 'meanders', 'back', 'forth', 'Piaf', 'life', 'agitated', 'pace', 'result', 'evocative', 'erratic', 'clich', 'eacute', '-driven', 'Director', 'Olivier', 'Dahan', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'Isabelle', 'Sobelman', 'get', 'carried', 'away', 'melodramatic', 'aspects', 'life', 'so', 'much', 'Piaf', 'across', 'less', 'three-dimensional', 'person', 'more', 'predictably', 'self-destructive', 'diva', 'making', 'up', 'severely', 'lacking', 'childhood', 'archetype', 'familiar', 'number', 'similar', 'celebrity', 'portraits', 'fromCoal', 'Miner', 'DaughtertoRay', 'film', 'most', 'Sidney', 'J.', 'Furie', 'episodicLady', 'Sings', 'Blues', 'Piaf', 'equally', 'ill-fated', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'are', 'kindred', 'spirits', 'comparison', 'brought', 'up', 'pointedly', 'film', 'fact', 'French', 'film', 'distinctively', 'Hollywood-style', 'sensibility', 'Dahan', 'dramatic', 'moment', 'repetitive', 'sense', 'crescendo', 'wearing', 'over', 'epic-length', 'running', 'time', '141', 'minutes.A', 'lot', 'time', 'film', 'spent', 'Piaf', 'miserable', 'childhood', 'when', 'drunken', 'mother', 'aspiring', 'singer', 'father', 'traveling', 'circus', 'performer', 'Eacute', 'dith', 'brothel', 'run', 'business-like', 'grandmother', 'prostitute', 'named', 'Titine', 'fond', 'Eacute', 'dith', 'care', 'when', 'blinded', 'temporarily', 'keratitis', 'Following', 'mother', 'footsteps', 'accompanied', 'confidante', 'Momone', 'Eacute', 'dith', 'sings', 'streets', 'Paris', 'remarkable', 'voice', 'impresses', 'local', 'nightclub', 'impresario', 'Louis', 'Lepl', 'eacute', 'When', 'stage', 'club', 'fate', 'secure', 'rest', 'story', 'told', 'disconnected', 'dramatic', 'episodes', 'film', 'extended', 'time', 'fateful', 'affair', 'world-class', 'boxer', 'Marcel', 'Cerdan', 'masterful', 'make-up', 'work', 'Didier', 'Lavergne', 'Jan', 'Archibald', 'Cotillard', 'completely', 'convincing', 'gawky', 'young', 'teen', 'dying', 'hunchbacked', 'woman', 'looking', 'decades', 'older', 'singer', '47', 'years', 'true', 'Piaf', 'spirit', 'musical', 'performances', 'lip-syncs', 'emotional', 'precision', 'particularly', 'impressive', 'five-minute', 'scene', 'single', 'uninterrupted', 'take', 'character', 'facing', 'tragic', 'news.Not', 'too', 'surprisingly', 'rest', 'cast', 'overshadowed', 'Cotillard', 'performance', 'few', 'leave', 'lasting', 'impressions', 'such', 'G', 'eacute', 'rard', 'Depardieu', 'Lepl', 'eacute', 'Emmanuelle', 'Seigner', 'Titine', 'Manon', 'Chevallier', 'Pauline', 'Burlet', 'Eacute', 'dith', 'ages', 'five', 'ten', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'pallid', 'work', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Martins', 'Cerdan', 'Caroline', 'Sihol', 'thankless', 'cameo', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'one', 'Piaf', 'most', 'fervent', 'admirers', 'However', 'Piaf', 'voice', 'effectively', 'presented', 'generation', 'admire', 'most', 'famous', 'songs', 'showcased', 'La', 'vie', 'en', 'rose', 'Hymne', 'agrave', ""l'amour"", 'Milord', 'masterpiece', 'twilight', 'years', 'Non', 'je', 'ne', 'regrette', 'rien', 'Moreover', 'most', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'first-rate', 'especially', 'Marit', 'Allen', 'period', 'costumes', 'Olivier', 'Raoux', 'production', 'design', 'Tetsuo', 'Nagata', 'cinematography', 'expert', 'use', 'low', 'lighting', 'childhood', 'sequences', 'excessive', '2007', 'DVD', 'only', 'one', 'extra', 'seven-minute', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'mainly', 'focused', 'Cotillard', 'tireless', 'work', 'transforming', 'Piaf', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'information', 'Piaf', 'help', 'elucidate', 'dramatic', 'flourishes', 'Dahan', 'brought', 'film']",La Vie en Rose

The story line is difficult to follow, unless someone is already familiar with the life of La Mme Piaf. I was not familiar with it and so had to do quite a bit of googling so I could understand what was happening in the film. Nevertheless, enough of Edith's vivid existence is captured with all the dirt and glamor so that the weight of mystery and tragedy is poignantly conveyed.Her life was a blending of the profane and the sacred, from her childhood spent in a brothel to the extraordinary intervention of St Th&eacute;r&egrave;se of Lisieux. The prostitutes who were raising Edith took her to the saint's grave in Lisieux and prevailed upon the Carmelite nun's intercession, so that the little girl was healed from blindness. She never forgot it, and neither did St. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, who will not let go of someone once she decides to fight for their soul.Poor Edith, she went through just about every terrible thing. The lurid brothel scenes of the film show prostitution to be the slavery that it is; the women could not seem to escape the lifestyle once they fell into it, in spite of their disgust and the horrific abuse they endured. Yet, the kindness with which they cared for Edith surpassed the treatment of many respectable people in her regard. Edith saw enough misery in the brothel so that she chose to sing for her supper rather than sell her body. She had to sing in order to live and in the end she could not live without singing.Needless to say, the demons of her childhood would not release her; Edith was enslaved by drugs, alcoholism, constantly seeking a love that could not be found in many lovers. And yet she always wore a cross; when she collapsed on stage, old before her time, she called upon Jesus and St. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se. The words of the Gospel come to mind: ""I will have mercy and not sacrifice. I come not to call the just but sinners."" (Matthew 9: 13) Watching ""La Vie en Rose"" gives one the hope that, in the end, Edith found the mercy that we all hope to receive.",4,The Little Sparrow,1195948800,"11 25, 2007",2007,2167,"['Anyone', 'who', 'delusion', 'worldly', 'success', 'key', 'happiness', 'only', 'watch', 'La', 'Vie', 'en', 'Rose', '2007', 'French', 'singer', 'Edith', 'Piaf', 'story', 'line', 'difficult', 'follow', 'someone', 'already', 'familiar', 'life', 'La', 'Mme', 'Piaf', 'was', 'not', 'familiar', 'so', 'had', 'do', 'quite', 'bit', 'googling', 'could', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'film', 'Nevertheless', 'enough', 'Edith', 'vivid', 'existence', 'captured', 'dirt', 'glamor', 'so', 'weight', 'mystery', 'tragedy', 'poignantly', 'conveyed.Her', 'life', 'was', 'blending', 'profane', 'sacred', 'childhood', 'spent', 'brothel', 'extraordinary', 'intervention', 'St', 'Th', 'eacute', 'r', 'egrave', 'se', 'Lisieux', 'prostitutes', 'who', 'were', 'raising', 'Edith', 'took', 'saint', 'grave', 'Lisieux', 'prevailed', 'Carmelite', 'nun', 'intercession', 'little', 'girl', 'was', 'healed', 'blindness', 'never', 'forgot', 'neither', 'did', 'St.', 'Th', 'eacute', 'r', 'egrave', 'se', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'someone', 'once', 'fight', 'soul.Poor', 'Edith', 'went', 'through', 'just', 'terrible', 'thing', 'lurid', 'brothel', 'scenes', 'film', 'show', 'prostitution', 'be', 'slavery', 'women', 'could', 'not', 'seem', 'escape', 'lifestyle', 'fell', 'spite', 'disgust', 'horrific', 'endured', 'kindness', 'cared', 'Edith', 'surpassed', 'treatment', 'many', 'respectable', 'people', 'regard', 'Edith', 'saw', 'enough', 'misery', 'brothel', 'chose', 'sing', 'supper', 'rather', 'sell', 'body', 'had', 'sing', 'order', 'live', 'end', 'could', 'not', 'live', 'singing.Needless', 'say', 'demons', 'childhood', 'would', 'not', 'release', 'Edith', 'was', 'enslaved', 'drugs', 'alcoholism', 'constantly', 'seeking', 'love', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'many', 'lovers', 'yet', 'always', 'wore', 'cross', 'when', 'collapsed', 'stage', 'old', 'time', 'called', 'upon', 'Jesus', 'St.', 'Th', 'eacute', 'r', 'egrave', 'se', 'words', 'Gospel', 'come', 'mind', 'will', 'have', 'mercy', 'not', 'sacrifice', 'come', 'not', 'call', 'just', 'sinners', 'Matthew', '9', '13', 'Watching', 'La', 'Vie', 'en', 'Rose', 'one', 'hope', 'end', 'Edith', 'found', 'mercy', 'hope', 'receive']",La Vie en Rose

Marion Cotillard played the role of Edith Piaf, French singing icon, to the hilt. The filming was atmospheric, moody, edgy, as was the directing. The only problem was that there was so much jumping around from one point to another in Piaf's tragically short life, that at times I couldn't follow the story line.The best parts of the film, for me, depicted Piaf's early life as a singer. Her evolution from street singer to the ""voice of Paris"" was fascinating. And with Cotillard's wonderful evocative performance, you could understand the reasons for Piaf's fame, even if you had no prior knowledge of her career. The sheer volume of emotion that Cotillard packed into Piaf's most famous songs was impressive.Unfortunately, the overall sense of the story dropped away as the director popped forward into Piaf's later life--sometimes for only a minute or two. The discontinuity was only accentuated by the fact that the film completely ignored the war years. This was not only a crucial time for France, but for Piaf as a performer. The fact that she sang for German officers opened her up to charges of Nazi collaboration, even though she supported the Resistance and valiantly saved Jews from certain death at great personal risk. The omission of this era in favor of far too many scenes showing Piaf as a drug-ridden, abusive egomaniac robbed much of the character from the film's subject, and did not do justice to the lady.Nevertheless, the film was enjoyable in an intense, French kind of way. With different editing (especially of the deathbed ""flashbacks"" referring to events that the film did not show), it would have been a much more coherent and moving portrait of one of the world's most significant and enduring voices.",3,Compelling but disjointed,1257379200,"11 5, 2009",2009,1801,"['La', 'Vie', 'en', 'Rose', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'absorbing', 'film', 'bit', 'disjointed', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'played', 'role', 'Edith', 'Piaf', 'French', 'singing', 'icon', 'hilt', 'filming', 'was', 'atmospheric', 'moody', 'edgy', 'was', 'directing', 'only', 'problem', 'was', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'jumping', 'one', 'point', 'Piaf', 'tragically', 'short', 'life', 'times', 'could', ""n't"", 'follow', 'story', 'line.The', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'depicted', 'Piaf', 'early', 'life', 'singer', 'evolution', 'street', 'singer', 'voice', 'Paris', 'was', 'fascinating', 'Cotillard', 'wonderful', 'evocative', 'performance', 'could', 'understand', 'reasons', 'Piaf', 'fame', 'even', 'had', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'career', 'sheer', 'volume', 'emotion', 'Cotillard', 'packed', 'Piaf', 'most', 'famous', 'songs', 'was', 'impressive.Unfortunately', 'overall', 'sense', 'story', 'dropped', 'away', 'director', 'popped', 'forward', 'Piaf', 'later', 'life', 'sometimes', 'only', 'minute', 'two', 'discontinuity', 'was', 'only', 'accentuated', 'fact', 'film', 'completely', 'ignored', 'war', 'years', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'crucial', 'time', 'France', 'Piaf', 'performer', 'fact', 'sang', 'German', 'officers', 'opened', 'up', 'charges', 'Nazi', 'collaboration', 'even', 'supported', 'Resistance', 'valiantly', 'saved', 'Jews', 'certain', 'death', 'great', 'personal', 'risk', 'omission', 'era', 'favor', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'showing', 'Piaf', 'drug-ridden', 'abusive', 'egomaniac', 'robbed', 'much', 'character', 'film', 'subject', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'lady.Nevertheless', 'film', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'intense', 'French', 'kind', 'way', 'different', 'editing', 'especially', 'deathbed', 'flashbacks', 'referring', 'events', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'coherent', 'moving', 'portrait', 'one', 'world', 'most', 'significant', 'enduring', 'voices']",La Vie en Rose

It is another world. I'm no longer on earth."" I won't be original if I join the viewers and critics all over the world that praised her performance as the best of last year. I think she deserves all the accolades she's received. She did not just act, she lived Piaf's life. She even looked small and fragile like Little Sparrow even she is 27cm taller that the legendary chanteuse. Marion Cotillard completely died in Edith Piaf. Not for a second did I think that it was a young modern actress, no I saw Edith Piaf, her huge eyes, her beautiful ""singing"" hands, her childlike smile; I heard Piaf loud throaty laugh, and when Marion sang, I was fully under impression that it was her voice because she made me believe that Edith's voice belonged to her in the movie, in that rare amazing performance which will be remembered and cherished as one of the cinema's precious treasures. One may argue that biopics are very hard to make, to bring the Artists with their talent, insecurities, personal problems, weaknesses, struggles, preferences, and  losses to life, to let us for a moment peak inside the great and mysterious process called creativity, to witness how a masterpiece is born be it a painting, a book, and yes, a song.

657909,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00005JPX8,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[3, 4]","The legendary Edith Piaf (1915-1963) was essentially a street person who possessed little emotional self-control and whose often difficult life included alcoholism, crippling car accidents, drug addiction, and a series of scandals that included accusations of Nazi sympathies during World War II.  But for all this, Piaf was a truly gifted artist whose talents ultimately outweighed her tempestuous personality and outrageous lifestyle: her fans, her friends, and her lovers seemed able to forgive anything when confronted with the scope of her vocal gifts.  Then as now, she is regarded as the sound of the soul of France.It would seem artistic and commercial suicide for any actress to play the role of one so well-recalled and so intensely beloved as Piaf--but not only actress Marion Cotillard dare risk it, she is remarkably successful in the role, offering what is easily one of the great performances in cinema history.  Once the film progresses beyond Piaf's childhood, Cotillard appears in virtually every shot, making LA VIE EN ROSE extremely dependent on her performance--and she carries it off in every scene.  The illusion is astonishing.The film has an unusual structure, darting back and forth in time between Piaf as a child, Piaf during her final years, Piaf at the peak of powers. (Perhaps wisely, however, director Olivier Dahan and the script carefully excludes mention of Piaf's tendency to party with the Nazis in occupied Paris.)  Cotillard makes the shifts with tremendous ease, as does the film itself.  The designs and their executions are brilliant from start to finish and you believe in them.Although the supporting cast is quite good, this is really Cotillard's show, and she does indeed make the most of it.  It is hardly surprising that she became only the second woman to win the Academy Award as Best Actress in a foreign language film: she deserved it.  The DVD includes a brief ""making of"" documentary that focuses on Cotillard and her director; the print is excellent, and the sound (which makes use of Piaf's original recordings) is very fine.

657910,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B00005JPX8,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[4, 5]","We are told that Edith Piaf was beloved to the French people--often called the ""Soul of France"". Born Edith Giovanna Gassion in 1915, later she became known as Piaf -the little Sparrow. Her life played out like a sad sonata -somewhere between Billy Holiday and Judy Garland; a soulful sound rising up from tragic circumstances--her depressing childhood, later indiscretions and addictions only endeared her more in the hearts of the French. Her full-throated torch singing went beyond merely rousing, into some realm of earthy magnificence that is hard to describe. Always a gamer, always ready to party the night away, within her brief time on this planet she packed in so much passion [Marcel Cerdan, Europe's greatest boxer, was both the love of her life and a married man.], so much travel, so much music, so many affairs [Yves Montand, Maurice Chevalier, Charles Aznavour], so much booze, wine, and drugs, that her frenetic activities seemed to mask her many maladies, her significant chronic pain, and her deep sadness.LA VIE EN ROSE (2007) ""My Merry Life"", aka LA MOME, was directed by Olivier Dahan. Always the flashy presenter, he used to be an artist, a painter, who enjoyed his own gallery shows in 1991. He began to direct films in 1994, and is most well known for dozens of music videos, all vogue with quick-cuts and glittering imagery. Watching this film was like a mixed blessing. Dahan used flashbacks, flash forwards, and scenes suspended in timelessness, all mixed up like a fragrant hobo stew; it smelled good but God knows what the next spoonful would bring. One had a very hard time staying with the point of view, or even the actual decade he was jumping around in; spiraling from 1920 to 1960 with the speed of a humming bird, flitting into a blur, only pausing momentarily here and there to suck up some honey. So we had to note the cars, the fashions, and the d&eacute;cor trying to keep up, to put the kaleidoscope into a modicum of focus.In essence we open on the dying Piaf, and the flash-abouts were explication, exposition, and even exploitation. In one of the earliest sections we meet Edith at 5 years old, played by Manon Chevallier. Her mother is a street singer, prone to melancholy and drink, who abandons first her soldier husband, and then the child, leaving Edith with her equally dysfunctional grandmother. Her father (Jean-Paul Rove), a circus contortionist, returns and takes custody of her, by this time 10 years old and played by Pauline Barlet. He found her ill, depressed, undernourished, and nearly blind. He took her to live with his mother, who happened to manage a brothel. The prostitutes adopt Edith, nursing her back to health, and providing her with a touch of affection. What she learns in that whore house would color her behavior for the rest of her life. The father, an unstable temperamental hard-drinking egotist, pulled her own of the lifestyle, and they lived as street performers. He wore a tuxedo, and he performed his contortionist act. It was not creating enough revenue, so one day Edith was asked to ""sing"" for her keep. She did sing, becoming popular on the streets, with a voice that was already remarkable.Marion Cotillard played Edith, and her magnificent transformation physically was truly remarkable. She found the right gait, the stooped posture, the arthritic awkwardness while using her hands and shoulders, and her incredible visceral passion for belting out a tune. She really did strike up bird imagery as she hopped about. She actually did some of her own singing, but Dahan looped Edith Piaf's actual voice over it. For the singing voice of the younger Edith, they used French singer Jil Argrot. Cotillard shaved back her hairline and her eyebrows to achieve the Piaf ""look"", and emerged as a dead ringer for the real thing. She had to endure five hours at the make up table to do the dying Edith scenes. Cotillard actually is a 32 year old gorgeous woman. She played the love interest, Fanny, in Ridley Scott's A GOOD YEAR (2006), with Russell Crowe -and she was Josephine in Tim Burton's BIG FISH (2003).Sylvie Testud was interesting as the life-long friend, Momone. Gerard Depardieu scored high in his cameo as the homosexual nightclub owner Louis Leplee. Jean-Pierre Martins made a good impression played Marcel Cerdon -Europe's greatest boxer. Cerdon's death after a plane crash had a strong emotional context thanks mostly to the titanic chewing up of the scenery that Cotillard managed. For those who want to know more about Piaf's great love affair, view Claude Lelouch's film EDITH ET MARCEL (1983).Today most of us in this country do not remember Edith Piaf, nor do we know much about her life. LA VIE EN ROSE only wetted my appetite relative to this enigmatic singer, patriot, and party girl. I resented Dahan's jarring rock video style of editing, but I enjoyed the art design and the actual music; what we heard of it. Of course I, too, was blown away by Marion Cotillard's powerful and touching performance.",3,Crippled Wings,1185408000,"07 26, 2007",2007,5005,"['are', 'told', 'Edith', 'Piaf', 'was', 'beloved',

This is a powerful, deeply moving tribute to a musical phenomenon whose impact on the world remains as heady as during her short lifetime (December 19, 1915-October 11, 1963). She remains a French icon but her singing and her life belong to the world: who can resist her ""poignant ballads performed in a heartbreaking voice"", the result of her life as an unwanted child, raised in a brothel, starting her career as a street singer with her circus contortionist father only to be discovered and given the opportunity to sing in a cabaret, a move that brought her to the attention of the world and made her one of the most sought after singers on the world's stages? No matter the degree of involvement in music, everyone has heard and reacted to her most famous songs 'La vie en rose', 'Hymne &agrave; l'amour', 'Milord', ' and of course her signature song 'Non, je ne regrette rien'.Writer/director Olivier Dahan (with assist from Isabelle Sobelman) has elected to present Piaf's impact on the world not as a linear biopic but rather as fragments from her existence as a child protected in a brothel by prostitute Titine (Emmanuelle Seigner), her life as a street singer with her pal Mmone (Sylvie Testud), her 'discovery' by Louis Lepl&eacute;e (G&eacute;rard Depardieu), her descent into alcoholism and drug addiction after the loss of the love of her life - a married boxer Marcel Cerdan (Jean-Pierre Martins), and her eventual fame in New York.  Oddly the impact she had on the French people during World War II is ignored and there are other large chunks of her life story that are missing.  But in the end the fragments we are given allow us to empathize and understand the persona of &Eacute;dith Piaf, and that makes any other misgiving irrelevant.Devan obviously found the perfect actress in Marion Cotillard ('A Very Long Engagement', 'A Good Life', 'Pretty Things', etc) whose immersion in the role is breathtakingly brilliant. The feature accompanying the film on the DVD (already 141 minutes in length!) allows us to see and hear the manner in which Devan and Cotillard recreated Piaf in makeup, costume, body language and of course impeccable lip-syncing of Piaf's songs.

657915,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B00005JPX8,Gregor von Kallahann,"[6, 6]","One can always argue with film bios.  This or that fact was left out (or conversely, dwelled on too long).  The director's or screenwriter's take on the protagonist's life may not be the same as that of scholars, fans or admirers of same.  The actors may be ""all wrong"" for the parts. And of course, sometimes the storyline is pretty  much cut out of whole cloth (e.g. LADY SINGS THE BLUES), of which Billie Holiday fans speak bitterly to this day.It's hard to imagine that this film will induce that kind of intense negative reaction in Edith Piaf's admirers (who are still legion four decades after her death).  There may be some quibbling (for example, in a film of such unsparing honesty, why should there be a ""surprise twist"" of any kind that's spared til the end?) but few will find the film fundamentally dishonest or compromised.  Of course, since the film covers its subject's entire life, there will be sequences that viewers will find too abbreviated.  I found myself just wanting a little more info on, say, Titine, the prostitute who took the young Edith under her wing, or just a tad more on the (non)relationship Edith had with her mother, herself a singer with dreams of glory.  A few more scenes with Depardieu couldn't have hurt either.  His character is no sooner established than he's dispatched with.The film's narrative techique, with its multiple flashbacks and flashforwards, has been one point of controversy.  I didn't care for the device the first time I saw the film.  The second time through, after all had pretty much been sorted out, it seemed less bothersome.  Many viewers might prefer a more linear narrative, but I've debated the film's structure with any number of friends and acquaintances (all admirers of Piaf, the film OR both) and few found the kaleidoscopic storyline all that disturbing.Some of the film's more surreal moments, the opening sequence, for instance, which has the singer collapsing on stage in NEW YORK and being attended to by a French speaking emergency crew (this, in a film which does not otherwise hesitate to be ""language appropriate"" depending on the locale).  Or are we flash forwarding (or flashing back) to one of the many other fainting spells--one in a French speaking area?  And am I alone in finding the dreamlike ""post-aircrash"" sequence just a little much?Ultimately, what makes all these reservations sound like quibbling is the emotional impact of the story itself and, more importantly, the amazing performance of Marion Cotillard.  One reads about actors ""inhabiting"" a character, and sometimes it's true and sometimes it's hype.  In this case, it is true.  Even the film's harshest critics (and there were several, believe it or not) have commented that Cotillard's performance is not to be missed.  Unless there proves to be an ""anti-VIE"" backlash, she will likely be one of the select group of actors in foreign language films to walk away with an Oscar this year.  And even if she doesn't, this is a performance that will become legendary among film buffs for decades to come.I saw LA VIE EN ROSE for the second time the night before I was scheduled for ""urgent""--if not quite EMERGENCY--surgery.  It's often said that one way of getting your mind of your own troubles is to immerse yourself in those of others.  The film--and Cotillard's performance--proved compelling enough to make me forget my own worldly concerns for a few hours.  For that reason--as well as for the opportunity to learn more about one of the last century's great popular singers--I was grateful.",4,Je vois la vie en rose,1198540800,"12 25, 2007",2007,3551,"['One', 'can', 'always', 'argue', 'film', 'bios', 'fact', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'conversely', 'dwelled', 'too', 'long', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'take', 'protagonist', 'life', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'same', 'scholars', 'fans', 'admirers', 'same', 'actors', 'may', 'be', 'wrong', 'parts', 'course', 'sometimes', 'storyline', 'pretty', 'much', 'cut', 'whole', 'cloth', 'e.g', 'LADY', 'SINGS', 'THE', 'BLUES', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'fans', 'speak', 'bitterly', 'day.It', 'hard', 'imagine', 'film', 'will', 'induce', 'kind', 'intense', 'negative', 'reaction', 'Edith', 'Piaf', 'admirers', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'legion', 'four', 'decades', 'death', 'may', 'be', 'quibbling', 'example', 'film', 'such', 'unsparing', 'honesty', 'why', 'should', 'there', 'be', 'surprise', 'twist', 'kind', 'spared', 'end', 'few', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'fundamentally', 'dishonest', 'compromised', 'course', 'film', 'subject', 'entire', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'sequences', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'too', 'abbreviated', 'found', 'just', 'wanting', 'little', 'more', 'info', 'say', 'Titine', 'prostitute', 'who', 'took', 'young', 'Edith', 'wing', 'just', 'tad', 'more', 'non', 'relationship', 'Edith', 'had', 'mother', 'singer', 'dreams', 'glory', 'few', 'more', 'scenes', 'Depardieu', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'hurt', 'character', 'sooner', 'established', 'dispatched', 'with.The', 'film', 'narrative', 'techique', 'multiple', 'flashbacks', 'flashforwards', 'been', 'one', 'point', 'controversy', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'device', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'had', 'pretty', 'much', 'been', 'sorted', 'out', 'seemed', 'less', 'bothersome', 'Many', 'viewers', 'might', 'prefer', 'more', 'linear', 'narrative', ""'ve"", 'debated', 'film', 'structure', 'number', 'friends', 'acquaintances', 'admirers', 'Piaf', 'film', 'OR', 'few', 'found', 'kaleidoscopic', 'storyline', 'disturbing.Some', 'film', 'more', 'surreal', 'moments', 'opening', 'sequence', 'instance', 'singer', 'collapsing', 'stage', 'NEW', 'YORK', 'being', 'attended', 'French', 'speaking', 'emergency', 'crew', 'film', 'not', 'otherwise', 'hesitate', 'be', 'language', 'appropriate', 'depending', 'locale', 'are', 'flash', 'forwarding', 'flashing', 'back', 'one', 'many', 'other', 'fainting', 'spells', 'one', 'French', 'speaking', 'area', 'am', 'alone', 'finding', 'dreamlike', 'post-aircrash', 'sequence', 'just', 'little', 'much', 'Ultimately', 'what', 'reservations', 'sound', 'quibbling', 'emotional', 'impact', 'story', 'more', 'importantly', 'amazing', 'performance', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'One', 'actors', 'inhabiting', 'character', 'true', 'hype', 'case', 'true', 'Even', 'film', 'harshest', 'critics', 'were', 'several', 'believe', 'not', 'have', 'commented', 'Cotillard', 'performance', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'be', 'anti-VIE', 'backlash', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'one', 'select', 'group', 'actors', 'foreign', 'language', 'films', 'walk', 'away', 'Oscar', 'year', 'even', ""n't"", 'performance', 'will', 'become', 'legendary', 'film', 'buffs', 'decades', 'come.I', 'saw', 'LA', 'VIE', 'EN', 'ROSE', 'second', 'time', 'night', 'was', 'scheduled', 'urgent', 'not', 'quite', 'EMERGENCY', 'surgery', 'often', 'said', 'one', 'way', 'getting', 'mind', 'own', 'troubles', 'immerse', 'others', 'film', 'Cotillard', 'performance', 'proved', 'compelling', 'enough', 'make', 'forget', 'own', 'worldly', 'concerns', 'few', 'hours', 'reason', 'as', 'well', 'opportunity', 'learn', 'more', 'one', 'last', 'century', 'great', 'popular', 'singers', 'was', 'grateful']",La Vie en Rose
657916,ASLHDTUUMOH7F,B00005JPX8,"Gregory E. Foster ""operabruin""","[11, 11]","Wow! Where to start?First, I guess, would be Kudos to director Olivier Dahan and all involved in the production and crafting of this wonderful film in reflection of the life of the Great Piaf! It is truly thrilling to see a young director pick a subject like this and do the Great Lady justice with his ""insight"", ""love"", and ""conviction"" to telling her story in a ""truthfully convincing"" way.While many seem to feel that the film is too ""confusing"" with all the juxtaposed pieces presented as they are, I find them to be wrong! First, it is a stroke of genius to present her story this way...after all, her life WAS kaleidoscopic, and this wonderful ""tool"" of  the director/editor(s) helps to show the confused/conflicted aspect of Piaf's life. Long have I been a devoted ""fan"" of Piaf, remembering her New York performances of '59 when I was a small boy...I was captivated by this tiny lady and helplessly drawn to her by her singing. Later, I would find the same thing with another great lady, Mlle. Callas, who had this same ""magic"" that one could not resist! I have read many biographies of Piaf, so I am familiar with her life forwards and backwards, and the people who have crafted this great ""view"" of her life have truly captured the honest ""feel"" for what her life was...and was not.What a wonderful thing to see an ""unknown"" like Marion Cotillard receive this fabulous role, and to simply ""blow the doors off"" doing it! She becomes Piaf! I am sure, of course, that what we get is an overall ""feel"" in general of Piaf, but it is done with such conviction that one truly feels they are looking at Piaf, suffering with Piaf, truly experiencing Piaf! Also, might I add, that it is SO heartwarming to see the great Gerard Depardieu (certainly France's greatest actor...ever) take a special guest appearance as Louis Lepl&eacute;e, the man who ""discovered"" her and started her on her way to fame, and, incidentally ""named"" her Piaf...""The Little Sparrow"". Also, magnificent in her part, as Marguerite Monnot, Marie-Armelle Deguy! Noted, also, is the believable portrail of Marcel Cerdan by Jean-Pierre Martins. One of the most special and surprising things in the film, is the very touching scene where a very moving ""nod"" and ""thank you"" comes from a spot-on cameo of Marlene Dietrich played by Caroline Sihol.Costumes, cinematography, and the music (that composed for the film...Piaf's recordings would, naturally, stand out anyway) all are first rate, and deserve notice. Beyond that, the Makeup is simply astonishing! I have NEVER seen such a transformation in my life! Truly Remarkable....an award is surely due here! To take Ms. Cotillard, from the young Piaf to the Piaf that we see at the ""institute"", who can barely walk even with help, aged and feeble beyond belief is truly a remarkable feat. Again, Kudos to these people who have ""brought this about""...they deserve recognition!Another brilliant stroke is to place ""Non, je ne regrette rien"", certainly her most indelible  of all her songs, where it is....one is left exhilirated (as you would have been at one of her performances), and poised to reflect on her life and what you have just witnessed.I cannot urge you enough to see this remarkable, and moving, film. Again, as in my title above, this, surely, MUST be the film to win for Best Foreign Film for 2007...I don't see how it could be passed over.If you love this movie, may I suggest that you go here:La Vie en Rose: La MmeAnd, if you find yourself bewitched by the Great Lady's singing, go here:30th AnniversaireThis teriffic 2-disc overview of her Best songs is an incredible bargain...do not miss it!I sincerely hope that I have not included anything in this review that would be ""spoilers"" for you, it is not my intent. However, one cannot truly review something without including descriptive details of the subject/item being reviewed.Do Enjoy this Wonderful Movie!~operabruinAddendum 2/25/08:Well, while the Academy chose not to nominate this film for Best Picture, Marion Cotillard was nominated for Best Actress, and she DID win the oscar for her stunning portrayl of Edith. AND, the film was also nominated for Best Makeup, and it DID win, also, for the amazing transformation of Ms. Cotillard into the debilitated Edith at the end of her life...this truly is one of the most amazing things I have seen in ANY film.

But the DVD is already on sale, and at a dramatic low price. The film was well made, rich indeed and the actress did a fabulous composition to fit with her part, because it was only a part that was dictated by the author and director. All the nostalgic liked it for a short while because it was some music from a distant past but so few of Piaf's songs were actually performed, and in their entirety, that the film lost its nostalgic appeal very fast. But the worse was still to come because the composite portrait painted on this screen has little to do with the real woman. So many things are absent. Her deep connections with Jews during the war for one, and after the war for two, with her famous Exodus song. And the extremely devout Catholic mirage projected onto that woman is absurd, to the point of ignoring her last husband nearly totally, since he was a Greek Orthodox. The woman is betrayed into a neurotic even psychotic capricious clown that kills herself with morphine and other drugs, willfully and consciously out of foolishness, love seen as a derangement, and plain suicidal conduct. She wasn't that. She was warm, loving, extremely attentive to others and many other qualities that are ignored and even rejected so that she appears as a crazy Catholic that is attached, in the most derogative Buddhist meaning, to a cross and a Saint and Jesus. I was asked recently to produce a note on her ""Jewishness"" and I was embarrassed because in spite of all the links she had with Jews and Judaism and Israel, it is difficult to find in her life a real testimony about her religion, especially with her last marriage being in the Orthodox faith. And I think that this bigotry of the film explains why it is already nearly given away to anyone who wants to grab it. I personally feel betrayed by this film because I lived that period in a completely different light with widely accepted maybe untruths but magical and mythical stories about this great lady that has inspired so many other artists.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",3,The Great Lady seen as a besotted drug addict,1225756800,"11 4, 2008",2008,2260,"['film', 'had', 'enormous', 'success', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'winner', 'quite', 'few', 'awards', 'Oscars', 'Caesars', 'DVD', 'already', 'sale', 'dramatic', 'low', 'price', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'made', 'rich', 'indeed', 'actress', 'did', 'fabulous', 'composition', 'fit', 'part', 'was', 'only', 'part', 'was', 'dictated', 'author', 'director', 'nostalgic', 'liked', 'short', 'while', 'was', 'music', 'distant', 'past', 'so', 'few', 'Piaf', 'songs', 'were', 'actually', 'performed', 'entirety', 'film', 'lost', 'nostalgic', 'appeal', 'very', 'fast', 'worse', 'was', 'still', 'come', 'composite', 'portrait', 'painted', 'screen', 'little', 'do', 'real', 'woman', 'So', 'many', 'things', 'are', 'absent', 'deep', 'connections', 'Jews', 'war', 'one', 'war', 'two', 'famous', 'Exodus', 'song', 'extremely', 'devout', 'Catholic', 'mirage', 'projected', 'woman', 'absurd', 'point', 'ignoring', 'last', 'husband', 'nearly', 'totally', 'was', 'Greek', 'Orthodox', 'woman', 'betrayed', 'neurotic', 'even', 'psychotic', 'capricious', 'clown', 'morphine', 'other', 'drugs', 'willfully', 'consciously', 'foolishness', 'love', 'seen', 'derangement', 'plain', 'suicidal', 'conduct', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'was', 'warm', 'loving', 'extremely', 'attentive', 'others', 'many', 'other', 'qualities', 'are', 'ignored', 'even', 'rejected', 'so', 'crazy', 'Catholic', 'attached', 'most', 'derogative', 'Buddhist', 'meaning', 'cross', 'Saint', 'Jesus', 'was', 'asked', 'recently', 'produce', 'note', 'Jewishness', 'was', 'embarrassed', 'because', 'spite', 'links', 'had', 'Jews', 'Judaism', 'Israel', 'difficult', 'find', 'life', 'real', 'testimony', 'religion', 'especially', 'last', 'marriage', 'being', 'Orthodox', 'faith', 'think', 'bigotry', 'film', 'why', 'already', 'nearly', 'given', 'away', 'anyone', 'who', 'grab', 'personally', 'feel', 'betrayed', 'film', 'lived', 'period', 'completely', 'different', 'light', 'widely', 'accepted', 'maybe', 'untruths', 'magical', 'mythical', 'stories', 'great', 'lady', 'inspired', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'artists.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",La Vie en Rose

The movie is a raw, sometimes shocking evocation of the French singer who survived poverty, abuse, and an almost feral existence to become one of the greatest concert hall singers ever. In very short time, however, her demons - drinking, drugs, too many men, and the loss of one man she especially loved - drag her down into her early grave at 47.Cotillard is brilliant in depicting Piaf's rise and miserable fall, and many of the singing performances (expertly lip-synched) soar, but I found the movie very painful to watch. Piaf's career breakthrough and highs pass quickly while the ghosts of her past and her current demons never seem to give her much chance to enjoy her life and success. The many scenes of drunken reveling are more sad than joyful, and the director's choice to jump back and forth in time was jarring and sometimes confusing. I was grateful for one lovely scene in which Piaf is approached at a night club by Marlene Dietrich who compliments her warmly. Piaf is deeply moved by Dietrich's tribute. It's the one scene in the film where Piaf seems to fully understand her talent and impact. I'm not suggesting the filmmakers should have cheered up Piaf's tragic life, but the movie could have used a few more grace notes like that.",4,"Spectacular Performance, Depressing Movie",1356912000,"12 31, 2012",2012,1391,"['purchased', 'La', 'Vie', 'en', 'Rose', 'see', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'remarkable', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'Edith', 'Piaf', 'was', 'rewarded', 'sense', 'movie', 'raw', 'sometimes', 'shocking', 'evocation', 'French', 'singer', 'who', 'survived', 'poverty', 'abuse', 'almost', 'feral', 'existence', 'become', 'one', 'greatest', 'concert', 'hall', 'singers', 'ever', 'very', 'short', 'time', 'however', 'demons', 'drinking', 'drugs', 'too', 'many', 'men', 'loss', 'one', 'man', 'especially', 'loved', 'drag', 'down', 'early', 'grave', '47.Cotillard', 'brilliant', 'depicting', 'Piaf', 'rise', 'miserable', 'fall', 'many', 'singing', 'performances', 'expertly', 'lip-synched', 'soar', 'found', 'movie', 'very', 'painful', 'watch', 'Piaf', 'career', 'breakthrough', 'highs', 'pass', 'quickly', 'ghosts', 'past', 'current', 'demons', 'never', 'seem', 'give', 'much', 'chance', 'enjoy', 'life', 'success', 'many', 'scenes', 'drunken', 'reveling', 'are', 'more', 'sad', 'joyful', 'director', 'choice', 'jump', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'was', 'jarring', 'sometimes', 'confusing', 'was', 'grateful', 'one', 'lovely', 'scene', 'Piaf', 'approached', 'night', 'club', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'who', 'warmly', 'Piaf', 'deeply', 'moved', 'Dietrich', 'tribute', 'one', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'Piaf', 'fully', 'understand', 'talent', 'impact', ""'m"", 'not', 'suggesting', 'filmmakers', 'should', 'have', 'cheered', 'up', 'Piaf', 'tragic', 'life', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'few', 'more', 'grace', 'notes']",La Vie en Rose

So, much of her fascinating story was new to me.  What I liked most was the unconventional way in which Olivier Dahan presented her story, told in a series of recollections which became increasingly disjointed as Edith's life began to fall apart.  This might be hard for some to follow, as Dahan moves back and forth in time and between concerts to present various aspects of her life.  The most charming and poignant scenes were of her relationship to the great French prizefighter, Marcel Cerdan.  This had a tremendous impact on her life and was reflected in her singing, as all her experiences were.  Piaf touched virtually everyone with the way she sang from deep in the heart, belying her tiny presence.  Comparisons to Billie Holiday are made.  Marion Cotillard makes no attempt to sing the songs, but she captures the essence of Piaf, taking the role deep to her heart much the way Salma Hayek did with Frida.

And therein lies a tale, because there are so many contradictory stories about her, including those from her, from her so-called ""sister"", from friends, from reviewers.  I had to go and read all of the bios that I could find about Piaf, and it was amazing how different they all were.  Even Edith herself wrote two different auto-bios and they were quite different from each other.  But the movie draws you in and claims you for the entirety of the film.

She ages back and forth, jumping playfully through the years of her life like some game gone tragic because we see her life, very early on in that recourse, that it does not indeed turn out like some fairy tale. Her hair creeps back revealing more of her prominant forehead, and her back becomes stooped over permenantly as if she carried invisible sacks of water. She becomes a terrible victim of addiction to Morphine and Alcohol and suffers the greatest loss, her amorous love Marcel. She worships Saint Theresa, only to be denied a funeral mass by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Paris. We see her again, but as a young girl, but with those familiar luminous green eyes. There is one thing that carries through all the times, ages, and transformations that grew to be a symbolism of love within her, and it was those gleamy, rare green eyes of hers.

I knew nothing of her life.""La Vie En Rose"" with its dizzying flashbacks and flashforwards and cutaways doesn't really tell me much I wanted to know about Piaf. She led a tragic life of abandonment as a child, alcoholism, drug addiction, cripping arthritis, several marriages, many lovers, a lost child and more. Her talent as a singer rescued her from the obscurity that otherwise would have been her fate.Piaf was a magnificient singer. I have no idea of what the lyrics were in English, but in French just the sound of her voice was entrancing.The saving graces of this film are Marion Cotillard's acting and the dubbing of Edith Piaf's voice. Cotillard's performance is spellbinding as Piaf ages from her 20's to her untimely death of liver cancer at 47.The script and direction seem common. You could substitute Janis Joplin or Judy Garland and make practically the same film. The fast cut style with all the flashbacks, flashforwards and cutaways is dizzying and does little to provide any understanding of Piaf, the person. We see her as the chronically abused child and teen. Then the imperious, demanding success. And the regretful dying woman. Only once do we see Piaf reasonably happy - when she is having an affair with French boxer Marcel Cerdan, who will not leave his wife for Piaf. But don't worry - he dies in an airplane crash leaving Piaf/Cotillard with an opportunity for one of the best scenery eating scenes you've ever seen.Having watched the movie, I don't think I have any greater understanding or knowledge of Edith Piaf than I had before - which wasn't much at all.

Rooney,"[0, 1]","""La Vie en Rose"" (2007) starring Marion Cotillard is the heart-wrenching story of Edith Piaf whose songs still are heard endlessly in the old-fashioned French caf&eacute;s and bistros. For a number of years there was too much exposure to her songs. She captured the spirit of France, and her music goes on and on.I came to this movie with the realization that I would see and hear her wonderful songs performed, but also dreading a replay of her sad life. When you see her name, you know it's going to be a downer. The film is overly long and repetitious. The sections on the California beach and her interview there could well have been cut out. The film in general needed tighter editing.The vocal numbers are very well-done. Piaf, the diminutive the little Sparrow, has become an icon and a clich&eacute;, a legend. This is a reliving of her tortured life, her drugs, her shooting-up of morphine, her tragic love affair with boxer Marcel Cerdan that ended in his plane crash.It's like watching Judy Garland's descent into stupor-land. There are too many scenes of her friends looking on anxiously to see if she can still carry on. Some of this is depressing because her brief bouts of happiness were so short-lived. It was a tough early life lived partly on the streets. She had been abandoned and grew up in a bordello.She came up the hard way and left the hard way. It's a sad picture that ends with her singing her classic ""I regret nothing."" Is she a monument to self-indulgence or a victim? Marion Cotillard does a brilliant job of portraying Piaf, really superb. Some of the songs were done using Piaf's own voice, others were dubbed by other singers, and some parts were sung by Cotillard herself.A diva gets boring after a time, especially a self-absorbed one on the road to self-destruction.

I was doing some research on ""Saving Private Ryan"", I was curious about the French singer that the American troops were listening to prior to the German attack.  I heard the name, Edith Piaf .  I asked my aunt if she knew who she was and she told me that she knew about Edith Piaf because she was very famous when my Aunt was younger.  I never heard of this woman before, yet I was very moved by the voice.  After doing some research On Edith Piaf I found there was a movie about her called ""La Vie en Rose"".  I found it at the Library and took it home and plugged it into my DVD player in my computer and sat back and watched.What unfolded in front of my eyes was by far one of the most emotional heart wrecking movies with such beautiful songs sung by Edith.  I was forced to tears and told everyone I knew, about this movie.  The directing and acting was superb. I have seen Marion Cotillard in a French movie before and I was very impressed with her performance.  It was no surprise that she walked up on the Academy stage to receive her well deserved Oscar.  There are people who come forth in our lives with such extraordinary talent and once or twice in our lifetime, Edith was one of these.  That voice cannot be reproduced it has such a special tone.The storyline was spellbinding, they told the story of this little lady's life, it was so tragic and how someone could survive such pains and loses and come to the forefront to be one of our greatest singers of an age is beyond my understanding.  The movie is summed up at the end with a most amazing song and just destroys me emotionally. ""Non! Rien de rien.  I play that song over and over and it has such meaning for me.

657939,A2DB720I9XRX7K,B00005JPX8,K. Draper,"[1, 1]","Brilliant performance from Marion Cotillard in the role of French super-star Edith Piaf (1915-1963). The film certainly has it's darkness, as it portrays Edith's true life from early childhood until her early death, but I did not find it overwhelmingly sad--more of her triumph and her gutsy-determination in spite of the astonishing circumstances she lived through.As the film starts, young Edith is waiting for her mother who is singing on the streets of Bellevue, Paris. Her father then rescues her from the neglect that she suffers with her mother, only to deposit her in the care of his mother (he is a soldier and cannot keep her), who runs a brothel. Despite the unseeminglyness of this seamy existence, Edith is much loved and cared for by the prostitutes there. Edith also suffers from blindness for an extended period there. Eventually Edith is reclaimed by her father, who brings her with him as he performs first as part of a circus, and then as a solo street act. It is then that Edith discovers that she can sing. Both of the girls that played Edith as a youngster did a good job, and I particularly enjoyed the one who plays Edith at about 12 years old who belts out the national anthem to the astonishment of the people on the street. I suppose that was another person singing, but it was sensational.As a teenager Edith continues to perform, but as a solo act accompanied by her friend Mmone. Her life takes a change when she is discovered on the street by a nightclub owner named Louis Lepl&eacute;e, who was so impressed with her that he takes her to the stage and creates the stage name ""Piaf"" (little sparrow) for her. Lepl&eacute;e becomes like a father figure for her. Unfortunately he meets an untimely demise. Soon Piaf gets a new mentor, Raymond Asso, who actually works her mercilessly to learn how to enunciate properly and improve her style. He even teaches her how to dress. She is then ready for her music hall debut, but can barely overcome serious stage fright that first time. After that, she performs to more and more audiences always pushing herself relentlessly. She is so driven to keep up a frantic pace, despite health problems or her need for rest.The film weaves back and forth between Edith's life growing up and her life as she is decrepit and frail at the very end. They really aged Marion Cotillard for these scenes--wrinkled, hunched over and with frizzy red hair; she looks much older than the 47 years Piaf was at her death. Piaf's lifestyle obviously led to her physical decline, but I think they overdid it. Her heavy drinking was portrayed in the film. Also, Edith developed arthritis and received morphine shots for that, eventually becoming quite addicted to the drug. The film is not entirely clear about what drug she is injecting, but this is what wikkipedia says. The romance between Edith Piaf and Marcel Cerdan, a fellow French national who is a boxer competing for the World Champion title, is beautifully portrayed.I am glad I got to see this interesting film and learn about Edith Piaf. The music is very beautiful in this, and the lip-synching is truly amazing; Cotillard is quite convincing in this regard. It also quite interesting to go to youtube and find videos of Edith Piaf singing many of the songs she was famous for, including the title song, ""La Vie en Rose"", and ""HER"" song,""""Je ne regrette rien"" (no regrets), which she sings at the Olympia in the last scene of the movie.Enjoy!",5,First-rate movie with terrrific music,1303862400,"04 27, 2011",2011,3455,"['Brilliant', 'performance', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'role', 'French', 'super-star', 'Edith', 'Piaf', '1915-1963', 'film', 'certainly', 'darkness', 'Edith', 'true', 'life', 'early', 'childhood', 'early', 'death', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'overwhelmingly', 'sad', 'more', 'triumph', 'gutsy-determination', 'spite', 'astonishing', 'circumstances', 'lived', 'through.As', 'film', 'young', 'Edith', 'waiting', 'mother', 'who', 'singing', 'streets', 'Bellevue', 'Paris', 'father', 'then', 'neglect', 'mother', 'only', 'deposit', 'care', 'mother', 'soldier', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'who', 'brothel', 'unseeminglyness', 'seamy', 'existence', 'Edith', 'much', 'loved', 'cared', 'prostitutes', 'there', 'Edith', 'also', 'blindness', 'extended', 'period', 'there', 'Eventually', 'Edith', 'reclaimed', 'father', 'who', 'first', 'part', 'circus', 'then', 'solo', 'street', 'act', 'then', 'Edith', 'discovers', 'can', 'sing', 'girls', 'played', 'Edith', 'youngster', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'who', 'Edith', 'about', '12', 'years', 'old', 'who', 'out', 'national', 'anthem', 'astonishment', 'people', 'street', 'suppose', 'was', 'person', 'singing', 'was', 'sensational.As', 'teenager', 'Edith', 'perform', 'solo', 'act', 'accompanied', 'friend', 'Mmone', 'life', 'change', 'when', 'discovered', 'street', 'nightclub', 'owner', 'named', 'Louis', 'Lepl', 'eacute', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'impressed', 'stage', 'stage', 'name', 'Piaf', 'little', 'sparrow', 'Lepl', 'eacute', 'becomes', 'father', 'figure', 'Unfortunately', 'untimely', 'demise', 'Soon', 'Piaf', 'new', 'mentor', 'Raymond', 'Asso', 'who', 'actually', 'mercilessly', 'learn', 'how', 'enunciate', 'properly', 'improve', 'style', 'even', 'how', 'dress', 'then', 'ready', 'music', 'hall', 'debut', 'can', 'barely', 'overcome', 'serious', 'stage', 'fright', 'first', 'time', 'more', 'more', 'audiences', 'always', 'pushing', 'relentlessly', 'so', 'driven', 'keep', 'up', 'frantic', 'pace', 'health', 'problems', 'need', 'rest.The', 'film', 'back', 'forth', 'Edith', 'life', 'growing', 'up', 'life', 'decrepit', 'frail', 'very', 'end', 'really', 'aged', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'scenes', 'wrinkled', 'hunched', 'frizzy', 'red', 'hair', 'much', 'older', '47', 'years', 'Piaf', 'was', 'death', 'Piaf', 'lifestyle', 'obviously', 'led', 'physical', 'decline', 'think', 'overdid', 'Her', 'heavy', 'drinking', 'was', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Also', 'Edith', 'developed', 'arthritis', 'received', 'morphine', 'shots', 'eventually', 'becoming', 'quite', 'addicted', 'drug', 'film', 'not', 'entirely', 'clear', 'what', 'drug', 'injecting', 'what', 'wikkipedia', 'romance', 'Edith', 'Piaf', 'Marcel', 'Cerdan', 'fellow', 'French', 'national', 'who', 'boxer', 'competing', 'World', 'Champion', 'title', 'beautifully', 'portrayed.I', 'am', 'glad', 'got', 'see', 'interesting', 'film', 'learn', 'Edith', 'Piaf', 'music', 'very', 'beautiful', 'lip-synching', 'truly', 'amazing', 'Cotillard', 'quite', 'convincing', 'regard', 'also', 'quite', 'interesting', 'go', 'youtube', 'find', 'videos', 'Edith', 'Piaf', 'singing', 'many', 'songs', 'was', 'famous', 'including', 'title', 'song', 'La', 'Vie', 'en', 'Rose', 'HER', 'song', 'Je', 'ne', 'regrette', 'rien', 'regrets', 'Olympia', 'last', 'scene', 'movie.Enjoy']",La Vie en Rose

Trying to keep up with where you are in the life of Piaf, which is so overwhelming complex and sad,makes for a jumbled chronological downhill slope in this rendering of the legendary chanteuse's journey.Spans of years are jumped forward and then backwards with information left unfulfilled. Also, there are not complete songs, but only startings and stoppings which does not allow us to totally appreciate Piaf's immense talent.Which leads me to my final thought.As this review is about the theatrical release,which needed to be extensively edited for theatre viewing for content and time in order to avoid the slap of the dreaded NC-17 rating,(something that happened with the original AMADEUS to avoid the then dreaded 'R'!)I feel somewhat confident that the extended release might smooth out the narrative with the deleted material ,but we won't know that for sure until it is released now will we?!Still this film is better than the others out there on Piaf.Let's hope the money we will have to spend for the director's cut will give the necessarily needed ""bang for the buck.""

Her parents abandoned her when she was a child. Lived with her grandmother who ran a prostition network. Had to live and sing in the streets in order to make some money. Was abused by those who wanted to take advantage of her singing talent in order to make some money. Deeply fell in love with a married man, who later died in a plane, which deeply broke her heart. Suffered from liver cancer that finally caused her death.In this movie we all really relate to Edith. We admire so much her passion for singing. We feel pity for her because of all the suffering she went through in her life.

She's brilliant, of course, as other posters have noted.  But I think Olivier Dahan should have gotten more praise. Remember, when you see him change time periods, that the French already know all about Piaf; she's still a national heroine, so it's not confusing to them, for whom this film was made.  They didn't need to see her with Yves Montand, or watch her work in the Resistance.  They already knew about that. This, as Cotillard has mentioned in interview after interview, is more a personal and emotional biography. To make my point: Look again at the first Piaf musical hall performance. It's basically a silent film, with wonderful music underneath. We see Piaf's movements, head thrusts, hands on hips -- this goes on quite a while, so when the standing ovation occurs it's almost a shock.

Little Edith is abandoned by her parents and goes to live in her grandmother's brothel.  There, she becomes blind from an eye disease and is cared for by the prostitutes.  When she recovers her sight, she is forced to join her father as a street performer.  Her remarkable singing voice is noticed by a night club manager and she begins her meteoric climb to success, but it is tempered by a series of personal tragedies.The beautiful Marion Cotillard gives the performance of her life as Edith as she physically transforms several times and is utterly convincing as a scrappy street kid, a sickly drug addict, and finally, a prematurely-aged invalid.  She rightly won the Best Actress Oscar for this challenging role.The movie is in French with English subtitles, but that didn't detract from my enjoyment at all; in fact, hearing the beautiful French throughout made it better.

The fluttering flashbacks bothered me less than the difference between the mellow, often fearful, child Edith and the flamboyant Piaf.  I couldn't find a bridge between the two; they seemed like totally different people.Marion Cotillard has won the Best Actress award from the Boston and Los Angeles Film Critics Associations, the Seattle International Film Festival, and has been nominated for a Golden Globe.  I'm sure she's on a short list of possible Oscar nominees that will be announced later this month.  As Edith Piaf, Cotillard is breathtaking, larger than life, and attacks the role with amazing intensity.  Frame by frame, she captures your attention and does not let you go.  The age span she plays is impressive.Gerard Depardieu plays the club owner Louis Leplee who discovers Edith on a street corner and first brings her to the stage.  Depardieu won a Golden Globe for ""Green Card"" in 1990 and was nominated for an Oscar for ""Cyrano de Bergerac.""  He plays the role to perfection in his short cameo.Jeanne-Pierre Martins plays Edith's love, the boxer Marcel Cerdan.  Martins was in a French film with the English title ""Leave Your Hands on My Hips"" in 2003.  He's got the romantic lead looks and does well as the married man from Morocco who captures Edith's heart.Sylvie Testud plays Edith's friend Momone.  Testud won the Best Actress award from the French Academy of Cinema for ""Stupeur et Tremblements.""  Her performance combusts on screen as she is drawn away from Edith screaming and later thrown away by Edith who has moved on to other people.  It is an excellent performance.Emmanuelle Seigner was impressive in the film her husband Roman Polanski directed with Johnny Depp,The Ninth Gate.  As Titine, a lady of the evening who comes to care for young Edith as a daughter, she is obsessed to the point of magic.  This builds to the scene where Edith's father takes her away, sending Titine almost insane with grief.Dahan has gathered an impressive cast and told the singer's life story with flare.

The prostitutes loved her and nursed her though a terrible sickness in which she lost her sight and her hearing.

You will be so spent after the one hundred forty-one minutes of this gut-wrenching film that when the lights come on at the end, you'll need a minute to figure out where you are, and then additional downtime to process all you've seen.  Days later, you'll still be thinking about this slice of life--and Edith Piaf.Piaf's story is well known to her long-time fans--brought up in a brothel, wrested from the only life she knew by her father so they could join the circus, her teen years on the streets, her ""rescue"" by a crime figure who gave her the start to her career, and, ultimately, her international success and final illness.  She was always frail, sickly, malnourished, and wildly temperamental.  She was often on drugs or alcohol, and she was always in search of true love (not finding it till late in her life).  All this is depicted here with its horrors and its rare moments of tenderness, the cinematography (Tetsuo Nagata) so brilliant that the realistic, dark settings invite the reader's emotional entry into them and exploration of them.Marion Cotillard becomes Piaf, a physical likeness that is uncanny in its realism (one wonders if she can ever play another part without conjuring up Piaf's image), and her emotional connection to Piaf's music is total.  Her song performances are absolutely flawless, as are her gestures, and the only clue that she is lip-synching is the unmistakable Piaf voice the emerges from her mouth.  Louis Leplee (Gerard Depardieu) as the nightclub owner whose murder by organized crime draws Edith in for questioning, shows the genuine care he has for Edith and the tough face of a man who has seen and done it all.Marcel Cerdan, the middleweight boxer who captures her heart (Jean-Pierre Martins), gives her something to live for, besides her music--at least for a while--and it is genuinely affecting here to see how earthy and unaffected he is in her presence.  The supporting actors, all French, are outstanding, and few viewers will forget Emmanuelle Seigner, playing prostitute Titine, who cared for Edith as a child.The film belongs to Cotillard, however, and all aspects of the film, from the brilliant writing of Olivier Dahan (who also directed) and Isabelle Sobelman, to film editing (especially the lip-synching to Piaf's songs), and the sets, costuming, and makeup, are designed to enhance her performance.  The film follows no chronology, jumping from her childhood to her old age and then to some of the high points of her career, creating an impressionistic film of some of the signal moments in her life.  It is difficult to imagine any biopic that will ever come close to this one in its power, but then, again, it's difficult to imagine any singer who will ever capture the world's imagination in quite the way that Piaf did. n  Mary Whipple",5,Exhausting!,1189555200,"09 12, 2007",2007,2884,"['Do', ""n't"", 'plan', 'see', 'film', 'then', 'go', 'out', 'lively', 'night', 'town', 'will', 'be', 'so', 'spent', 'one', 'hundred', 'forty-one', 'minutes', 'gut-wrenching', 'film', 'when', 'lights', 'come', 'end', ""'ll"", 'need', 'minute', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'are', 'then', 'additional', 'downtime', 'process', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Days', 'later', ""'ll"", 'still', 'be', 'thinking', 'slice', 'life', 'Edith', 'Piaf.Piaf', 'story', 'well', 'known', 'long-time', 'fans', 'brought', 'up', 'brothel', 'wrested', 'only', 'life', 'knew', 'father', 'could', 'join', 'circus', 'teen', 'years', 'streets', 'rescue', 'crime', 'figure', 'who', 'gave', 'start', 'career', 'ultimately', 'international', 'success', 'final', 'illness', 'was', 'always', 'frail', 'sickly', 'malnourished', 'wildly', 'temperamental', 'was', 'often', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'was', 'always', 'search', 'true', 'love', 'not', 'finding', 'till', 'late', 'life', 'depicted', 'here', 'horrors', 'rare', 'moments', 'tenderness', 'cinematography', 'Tetsuo', 'Nagata', 'so', 'brilliant', 'realistic', 'dark', 'settings', 'invite', 'reader', 'emotional', 'entry', 'exploration', 'them.Marion', 'Cotillard', 'Piaf', 'physical', 'likeness', 'uncanny', 'realism', 'one', 'wonders', 'can', 'ever', 'play', 'part', 'conjuring', 'up', 'Piaf', 'image', 'emotional', 'connection', 'Piaf', 'music', 'total', 'song', 'performances', 'are', 'absolutely', 'flawless', 'are', 'gestures', 'only', 'clue', 'lip-synching', 'unmistakable', 'Piaf', 'voice', 'emerges', 'mouth', 'Louis', 'Leplee', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'nightclub', 'owner', 'murder', 'organized', 'crime', 'draws', 'Edith', 'questioning', 'genuine', 'care', 'Edith', 'tough', 'face', 'man', 'who', 'seen', 'done', 'all.Marcel', 'Cerdan', 'middleweight', 'boxer', 'who', 'heart', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Martins', 'something', 'live', 'music', 'least', 'while', 'genuinely', 'affecting', 'here', 'see', 'how', 'earthy', 'unaffected', 'presence', 'supporting', 'actors', 'French', 'are', 'outstanding', 'few', 'viewers', 'will', 'forget', 'Emmanuelle', 'Seigner', 'playing', 'prostitute', 'Titine', 'who', 'cared', 'Edith', 'child.The', 'film', 'belongs', 'Cotillard', 'however', 'aspects', 'film', 'brilliant', 'writing', 'Olivier', 'Dahan', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'Isabelle', 'Sobelman', 'film', 'editing', 'especially', 'lip-synching', 'Piaf', 'songs', 'sets', 'costuming', 'makeup', 'are', 'designed', 'enhance', 'performance', 'film', 'chronology', 'jumping', 'childhood', 'old', 'age', 'then', 'high', 'points', 'career', 'creating', 'impressionistic', 'film', 'signal', 'moments', 'life', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'biopic', 'will', 'ever', 'come', 'close', 'one', 'power', 'then', 'again', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'singer', 'who', 'will', 'ever', 'capture', 'world', 'imagination', 'quite', 'way', 'Piaf', 'did', 'n', 'Mary', 'Whipple']",La Vie en Rose

Piaf is an iconic French singer who turned into a symbol of her country, and remains one many decades after her death.If you are one of Piaf's fans, I'm certain that you will like this movie, because it depicts strikingly several moments of her tragic and turbulent life. It is impossible to denny that Marion Cotillard was the right choice to play the main character, as she is simply splendid as Edith Piaf, so good in fact that she tends to make us forget that Piaf is not longer alive.In case you don't have the faintest idea of who Edith Piaf was, don't worry, this movie is an excellent starting point to learn about her. Of course, no film can be totally objective, but by the end of ""La vie en rose"" you will know some details about Piaf's life, and will have heard some of her wonderful songs.All in all, I believe that this is a film that is powerful and worth watching, despite the fact that it is rather gut-wrenching sometimes. Recommended...Belen AlcatPS: The songs you will hear in this film are sang by Edith Piaf (Cotillard does lip-synching).

I have to say I have been somewhat surprised by the difference between the rave reviews I have heard and read and my own experience. As with several other reviewers, I knew nothing of Edith Piaf's life before seeing this. One of the things I found most disappointing was the confusion caused by all the jumping around and I agree with the reviewer who said that they felt not being grounded in one time of her life was problematic. There were so many moments, events, and people who came in and out without it being clear what the importance of it/them was and by the end my roommate and I were sitting there trying to piece some greater clarity together.I think what was perhaps most troubling for me with this movie was that I always felt that I was watching Edith Piaf's life completely from the outside rather than seeing it through hers or really connecting with the pain, the joy, the tragedy, the exhiliration that she felt. I felt like there was too much distance. Perhaps this is because, as I have come to find, there is still a great deal of mystery about her early life and perhaps some of her later life as well. Perhaps it is not possible to know her true emotional experience because she did not share that with anyone (with the exception of maybe Marcel and Simone) and maybe that it part of the point of the movie.All of that being said, I think it is worth seeing, if only to be introduced to an incredible artist. The actress who played her was excellent and some of the scenes were shot beautifully.

657963,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JPX8,mirasreviews,"[6, 8]","Olivier Dahan's biopic of French chanteuse Edith Piaf takes its American title, ""La Vie en Rose"", from one of Piaf's most popular songs. The film is called ""La  Mme"" in France, meaning the kid or urchin, after Piaf's early stage name ""La Mme Piaf"". This film doesn't tell the story of Edith Piaf so much as it highlights major events in her life from the age of 3 until her death in 1963 at age 47, starting in New York in 1959 and skipping backward and forward in time until it has covered all of the episodes that have been deemed significant in no particular order. The result is that we come to recognize Piaf's personality but understand very little of her character.Piaf was raised in poverty, first by a neglectful mother, then a neglectful grandmother, before her father placed her in the care of his mother, who managed a brothel. Then it was the circus,  performing on the streets, and more meager living until Edith (Marion Cotillard) was discovered at age 20 by nightclub owner Louis Leplee (Gerard Depardieu), who set her on the road to stardom. An overbearing personality, constantly at odds with her manager Louis Barrier (Pascal Greggory), alcoholic,  morphine-addicted, Piaf nevertheless became a singing sensation in much of the Western world.""La Vie en Rose"" focuses on events taken out of context, not on how Edith Piaf lived. Piaf's loss of those people whom she loved is a recurring theme, and I have the impression that these events in her life are supposed to explain who she was. I don't buy that. People are not the sum of the things that happen to them, and the episodic nature of this film does little to illuminate its subject. It's not a character study. It's a list. Edith Piaf was a miserable person who made everyone around her miserable. That's all I can gather from this film, and I don't have much faith in it, since she is represented so superficially and selectively.In the end, ""La Vie en Rose"" fails to make Edith Piaf interesting. Marion Cotillard gives an impressive physical performance, aided by great make-up, of a strong, self-destructive personality at different stages of her life and different states of failing health. There is not much depth of emotion, but I blame the script for that, not Cotillard. At 2 hours and 20 minutes, ""La Vie en Rose"" is too long, and its inconsistent use of date stamps is frustrating. Most of the songs are lip-synched to Piaf's recording, so we get to hear her voice. There is not much substance here, but Cotillard as Piaf is as captivating on stage as the real thing. In French with subtitles.The DVD (HBO Video 2007): The only bonus feature is ""Stepping Into Character"" (7 min), in which director Olivier Dahan and actress Marion Cotillard talk about researching Edith Piaf, preparing for the role, Cotillard's approach to the character, and the make-up.

Every personal transaction is so full of desperate mugging and neediness, that  by the time an actual tragedy strikes Piaf with the death of a loved one, your emotional capital is already so exhausted by Cotillard's shameless straining that you could really care less how she feels -just make her stop screaming, ""MARCEL!! MARCEL!!!"" It's the equivalent of a performance grabbing your arm and twisting it behind your back until you cry, ""PLEASE, I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT, JUST STOP!!!""There is little biographical evidence to suggest the actal Piaf was as disastrous a personality as portrayed here; it just smells of an actress seeing her big shot at the Oscar with over-the-top histrionics the Academy loves, and of course being rewarded for such a travesty.

So it seems something has been lost in translation as I watched this movie. I think a basic review of her life is needed before watching this movie. I knew virtually nothing about Piaf's life before watching this movie (but I enjoyed her music).This movie hops around in time making for a muddled narrative. There is no ""current time"" to ground the story and characters. Are these flashbacks? Flash forwards? It's all of them! Characters disappear and then reappear without any explanation. The movie shows Piaf had a son who died when she was a teenager(?) -- more than three-quaters of the way into the movie.And while actress Marion Cotillard makes for a luminous younger Piaf, her older portrayal ends up like an over-the-top Tracy Ullman character. As a biography, it raises too many questions without answering them. What were they injecting her with? What was the plane crash she mentioned she was in? Didn't she have any rivals? Who did she have the child with? Why was she worn out at such a young age? Why did she visit California? Did she only perform live?

It is an intimate and quite sad biopic on the turbulent life of the ""the Sparrow"" Edith Piaf. It follows her life from her youth on the streets of Paris, through her years as a cabaret singer, and finally to French national icon and international superstar. Piaf is brilliantly played by Marion Cotillard in one of the better performances I have seen in a while.I should probably confess that I'm not a ""fan"" of Piaf's. It's not that I don't like her music, it's just that I've really never listened to her and don't know anything about her. In fact, I had never heard of her until I saw 'Saving Private Ryan' several years ago. I say this only to point out that my ignorance no doubt hindered my appreciation of the film. Nevertheless, Piaf was quite the interesting character. According to the film, she was very tempermental and downright child-like in many ways. She could be very callous towards those around her, but was also very shy and submissive to certain people. Her love affair with boxer Marcel Cerdan was quite moving, she was completely enamored with him and was like a little schoolgirl with a crush in his presence. Whether it was anger, love, despair or jubilance, Piaf was clearly a woman who was overflowing with emotion. Her short life was full of tragedy and misery; her drug addiction, the constant deaths of those around her, and her debilitating medical problems make her a very tragic figure.I'm not sure if it was just Piaf that was strange to me, or the French in general, maybe both. At one point in the film, Piaf exclaims, ""I don't get them (Americans), and they don't get me."" I found myself nodding in agreement. This was simply a matter of taste though and should not be taken as a criticism of the film's quality, or as disrespect for the French for that matter. I guess my point is just that although I could sympathize, the cultural difference kept me from truly relating. My only real complaint about the film itself was the constant chronological back and forth. One minute it's 1963, then 1940, then 1955, all with no apparent rhyme or reason. I found this very distracting. Nevertheless, I thought this was a well-made film about a fascinating character.

Marion Cotillard  who plays Piaf is unforgetable in her performance.  She was able to capture Piaf's unusual charm, and her dramatic physical transformations.  There was an article about Piaf's life in one of the recent New Yorker Magazine's articles and film pretty much touched up on all aspects of her greater than life personal experiences.  This is one of those biographies, one is looking forward to seeing about the woman who was and still is cross generational music legend.  She is crude, laughs too loud, walks funny, she is too thin, but yet we love her for her art and determination to live her life under her own terms no matter what.  Let's hope that young Marion Cotillard gets more work in the future, because her talent is still untapped.  She will be the star herself as well.  Wonderful movie for all generations.

""Christina! Apportez-moi la Ax!"".Little Edith's life starts in miserable neglect and ends in neglectful misery... ...oh, and she becomes a famous singer in the middle. The problem with this movie is the screenplay: you know how in a TV miniseries events flash forward from crisis to crisis with no time for emotional development in the middle? That's what happens here. For all its high-fallotin' trappings, ""La Vie En Rose"" is essentially a pot-boilerish soap opera movie, with little to no character development for anyone but Cotillard - and even then, Cotillard's script ranges from truculent teen to truculent old lady. There's not enough exploration given to any one facet of Piaf's character, or to the possible consequences of Piaf's early tragedies.And tragedies there are! Early, middle and late life tragedies... ...two whole hours of tragedies! There's one particularly lovely scene where Cotillard's talent is allowed to express something other than fear, rage or sadness: there's a real sense of childlike wonder and mutual adoration when Piaf meets Dietrich - but this scene is atypical, and sadly, scenes like it are in very short supply.Supporting cast members sort of blend into one after a while: the nicest thing one can say about Depardieu and Jean-Pierre Martins is that the screenplay gives them five sympathetic minutes apiece before they (and their potentially interesting storylines) are dispatched without ceremony, to be replaced with another bout (or twelve) of hardship and shouting. Although Sylvie Testud gives a very compelling performance as Momone, again, we don't get enough of it.Direction is pretty, nothing unusual and nothing memorable.The dialogue is alright, too - but sadly seems to consist of a number of set-pieces with no explanation of cause or consequence to create a sense of a fluid narrative.I needed hiking boots to wade through to the end of ""La Vie En Rose"". I'm going to get seventeen million unhelpful review votes for this, but I have to call it as I see it. High Art, this is not. It's not a fair-handed retelling of the life of a great artist, and it's not even a particularly well-made movie. Cotillard might be great, but her greatness, along with the rest of the movie, is overwhelming and ultimately hollowed out by its own emotionally unavailable content.Rent if you're curious.",2,"Ne Pas de Wire Hangers!

I've seen ""Away From Her"", and I think Marion Cotillard's performance stands  to surprise us. Cotillard was in practically every scene (once things get going), and the range of emotion is astonishing. Indeed, a powerful performance. That Ms. Piaf died at age 47 is not surprising, given her outrageous lifestyle, and the editing is such that certain time-frames are a bit confusing. Even a 4-hour film couldn't tell everything about the emotions and motivations surrounding this most enigmatic star. Everything rests on the shoulders of young Marion Cotillard to create this riveting performance. Director Olivier Dahan kept this almost 2 hour film exciting and never at all boring. It's too bad that the Academy eliminated its category for Adapted Score, because this rivals any I've heard. The incidental music of Christopher Gunning is excellent. This is a film about music, that wonderful element in our lives that keeps us going, whether we're aware of it or not. Mr. Dahan knows this, and the result is a devastating, heartfelt examination of a troubled woman who was too aware that without music, she would die. The moody cinematography and gritty art direction are to be commended. Great use of color. Also the costumes and, especially, the make-up (both Oscar nominated) are exceptional. The DVD I watched was in a generous widescreen, and had only one extra, comments from Dahan & Cotillard. That our Oscar nominated actress is only 30 years old... well, I'm blown away! Few actresses have affected me with their performance as much as Ms. Cotillard.

657987,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JPX8,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","""La Vie en Rose"" is the highly acclaimed biopic of Edith Piaf, France's most famed chanteuse, who died in 1963 at the tragically young age of forty-seven.  With a childhood worthy of a Dickensian waif (ripped away from her alcoholic mother and raised in a brothel), Piaf began at an early age singing for her supper on street corners, first with her unemployed father then with a close girlfriend by the name of Momone.  It didn`t take long for Piaf's talent to be ""discovered,"" and she was soon performing in cabarets and nightclubs, eventually achieving stardom on an international scale before the age of thirty.  But, as appears to be the case with virtually all successful artists, Piaf waged a lifelong battle against a whole host of personal demons, prime among them booze, an addiction to pain killers, and an undying love for a man she could never fully have (the married boxer Marcel Cerdan).  And, again, as with so many artists, Piaf suffered from that paradoxical combination of raging egotism and massive insecurities, resulting in a high-strung, temperamental personality that served to drive even her closest companions away at times when she needed them most.For the first hour-and-a-half or so, ""La Vie en Rose"" is an impressively mounted but relatively conventional and undistinguished biography, charting the rise and fall of its subject though a complex (though occasionally rather confusing) crazy quilt of flashbacks and flash-forwards.  But in the story`s final act, as Piaf moves inexorably closer to the end of her life, the movie becomes a deeply moving and heartbreaking study of a talented woman brought down by the cruelties of fate (she suffered from crippling arthritis) and her own self-inflicted wounds.Clearly, the chief selling-point of ""La Vie en Rose,"" written by Isabelle Sobelman and Olivier Dahan and directed by Dahan, is the stunning tour de force (and Oscar-winning) performance by Marion Cotillard, who inhabits the character so completely that we truly feel we are watching Edith Piaf herself in the flesh (an illusion enhanced by the filmmakers' reliance on actual Piaf recordings for the singing).  Cotillard goes from portraying a budding and spirited young woman learning to survive on the streets to a decrepit old woman whose body has betrayed her - all without missing a beat.  She is particularly impressive in the latter stages of the movie as Piaf, after years of illness and addiction, seems to wither away before our very eyes.  Special kudos must also go to make-up artists Jan Archibald, Didier Lavergne, Matthew Smith and David White for some of the most impressive aging work I have ever seen on screen.The film itself approaches greatness only near the end, but Cotillard's performance is genuinely great throughout.",4,"good film, great performance",1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,2779,"['La', 'Vie', 'en', 'Rose', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'biopic', 'Edith', 'Piaf', 'France', 'most', 'famed', 'chanteuse', 'who', 'died', '1963', 'tragically', 'young', 'age', 'forty-seven', 'childhood', 'worthy', 'Dickensian', 'waif', 'ripped', 'away', 'alcoholic', 'mother', 'raised', 'brothel', 'Piaf', 'began', 'early', 'age', 'singing', 'supper', 'street', 'corners', 'first', 'unemployed', 'father', 'then', 'close', 'girlfriend', 'name', 'Momone', 'didn', 't', 'take', 'long', 'Piaf', 'talent', 'be', 'discovered', 'was', 'soon', 'performing', 'cabarets', 'nightclubs', 'eventually', 'achieving', 'stardom', 'international', 'scale', 'age', 'thirty', 'be', 'case', 'virtually', 'successful', 'artists', 'Piaf', 'waged', 'lifelong', 'battle', 'whole', 'host', 'personal', 'demons', 'prime', 'booze', 'addiction', 'pain', 'killers', 'undying', 'love', 'man', 'could', 'never', 'fully', 'have', 'married', 'boxer', 'Marcel', 'Cerdan', 'again', 'so', 'many', 'artists', 'Piaf', 'suffered', 'paradoxical', 'combination', 'raging', 'egotism', 'massive', 'insecurities', 'resulting', 'high-strung', 'temperamental', 'personality', 'served', 'drive', 'even', 'closest', 'companions', 'away', 'times', 'when', 'needed', 'most.For', 'first', 'hour-and-a-half', 'so', 'La', 'Vie', 'en', 'Rose', 'impressively', 'mounted', 'relatively', 'conventional', 'undistinguished', 'biography', 'charting', 'rise', 'fall', 'subject', 'complex', 'occasionally', 'rather', 'confusing', 'crazy', 'quilt', 'flashbacks', 'flash-forwards', 'story', 's', 'final', 'act', 'Piaf', 'inexorably', 'closer', 'end', 'life', 'movie', 'deeply', 'moving', 'heartbreaking', 'study', 'talented', 'woman', 'brought', 'down', 'cruelties', 'fate', 'suffered', 'crippling', 'arthritis', 'own', 'self-inflicted', 'wounds.Clearly', 'chief', 'selling-point', 'La', 'Vie', 'en', 'Rose', 'written', 'Isabelle', 'Sobelman', 'Olivier', 'Dahan', 'directed', 'Dahan', 'stunning', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'who', 'character', 'so', 'completely', 'truly', 'are', 'watching', 'Edith', 'Piaf', 'flesh', 'illusion', 'enhanced', 'filmmakers', 'reliance', 'actual', 'Piaf', 'recordings', 'singing', 'Cotillard', 'portraying', 'budding', 'spirited', 'young', 'woman', 'learning', 'survive', 'streets', 'decrepit', 'old', 'woman', 'body', 'betrayed', 'missing', 'beat', 'particularly', 'impressive', 'latter', 'stages', 'movie', 'Piaf', 'years', 'illness', 'addiction', 'wither', 'away', 'very', 'eyes', 'Special', 'kudos', 'must', 'also', 'go', 'make-up', 'artists', 'Jan', 'Archibald', 'Didier', 'Lavergne', 'Matthew', 'Smith', 'David', 'White', 'most', 'impressive', 'aging', 'work', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'screen.The', 'film', 'greatness', 'only', 'end', 'Cotillard', 'performance', 'genuinely', 'great']",La Vie en Rose

All the songs are actual Edith Piaf recordings, with Marion Cotillard flawlessly lip-synching and reproducing Piaf's brave, battered, sparrow-in-the-storm stance. Cotillard truly earned her Academy Award for this role.It was probably a good decision to have her lip-synch rather than spend months learning how to approximate her subject's voice. The latter approach might produce a good conversation piece (""You mean to say you'd never sung a note before?"") - as it did for such recent biopics as ""Walk the Line,"" in which Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon went into training to reproduce Johnny and June Cash. But when original recordings are available, that labored mimicry, however successful, ends up seeming like a lot of wasted time.Despite the music, this isn't an easy film to watch. There is the wrenching nature of Piaf's days, from childhood on to the end. Then there are the English subtitles, necessary for those of us who don't speak French. Finally, the DVD tends to be very murky in most scenes, and I'm not sure always intentionally so.The Director's goal here was not to make a documentary of Piaf's life. He was aiming at creating something more impressionistic. His pointillist approach ends up being possibly a little too arty though. We see Piaf lurching forward out of a murky background in a burst of grief; lurching out in a burst of temperament; lurching out in a burst of forced, besotted gaiety; lurching out in a burst of anger. But there's little to connect these spotlights of raw emotion. While not demanding a totally linear account of her life, I would have liked a little more continuity and explanation. For example, why was she held responsible by so many for the death of her promoter?At the end of the movie, I felt as if I hadn't gotten to know Edith Piaf at all. Only her voice remained, shining forth from the background muddiness. But that was perhaps the only, the ultimate point of her life.

657991,A6FIAB28IS79,B00005JPX8,Samuel Chell,"[0, 1]","It seems contradictory to praise a film for its star's performance while faulting it for overly busy, manipulative editing.  In the hands of a clever filmmaker-editor-scriptwriter, most of us could come off looking reasonably competent.  But as will be clear even to those unfamiliar with Edith Piaf's life or music, Marion Cotillard gives perhaps the most impressive performance of the new millennium in the role of ""The Little Sparrow.""Somehow she manages to stay a cut ahead of Olivier Dahan's overly slick and clever movie with her mercurial changes--one moment mousey and woebegone, the next an out-of-control feral cat on the attack; a Tomboyish and modest international star one moment, a demanding and self-destructive diva the next; a weathered and withered little scarecrow one instant, a noble and courageous heroine the next.  Her body and facial language are equally expressive--both telling us the story of Edith Piaf less through script than sheer rhetoric of character.Nevertheless, I'd recommend the viewer read a brief account of Edith Piaf's life (Wickipedia is pretty good) before watching the film.  Besides moving his camera all over the place and violating temporal-spatial conventions, writer-director Dahan tends to embed flashbacks within flashbacks, requiring the viewer to keep four or more time periods simultaneously in mind, and he frequently cuts to a character about whose identity (in some cases, ""reality"") we remain clueless until much later in the sequence.  Better to get the plot-story business out of the way lest it distract from Cotillard's extraordinary accomplishment.Unfortunately, there's another reason to do a quick prep on Piaf's life and career before viewing film.  Like the vast majority of biopics about musicians (Billie Holiday, Cole Porter, Charlie Parker, Dexter Gordon immediately come to mind), the film fails not only to show us why Piaf's talent was so special but to showcase the songs in a manner that ensures they will be remembered and discovered by a new generation of listeners.  The director appears to assume that, like ""La Vie en Rose,"" every viewer will automatically respond to the strains of ""Hymn l'Amour"" and ""Je Ne Regrette Rien.""Perhaps like a majority of the movie-going public, the filmmaker has little interest in, let alone knowledge about, Piaf's music.  His Piaf, despite any testimony to the contrary, lives not solely for her art but for love.  Numerous musicians have made sacrifices and paid prices similar to Piaf's--but it was for the music.  Great artists have to be willing to die for their art, but that's not the message of this script.  Fortunately, Cotillard's Piaf emerges as far more than another tragic heroine or sensationalized story about the fall of a star.  But why are we so attracted to a figure who from the start is so undeniably unattractive? That's the question we continually ask ourselves, even as the resonance and magnetism of her character lead us ever closer to the only place we're likely to find an answer--her art.The next move must be the spectator's.",4,"Gripping, must-see, unforgettable performance in a film too smart for its own good",1215993600,"07 14, 2008",2008,3070,"['contradictory', 'praise', 'film', 'star', 'performance', 'faulting', 'overly', 'busy', 'manipulative', 'editing', 'hands', 'clever', 'filmmaker-editor-scriptwriter', 'most', 'could', 'come', 'off', 'looking', 'reasonably', 'competent', 'will', 'be', 'clear', 'even', 'unfamiliar', 'Edith', 'Piaf', 'life', 'music', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'perhaps', 'most', 'impressive', 'performance', 'new', 'millennium', 'role', 'Little', 'Sparrow', 'Somehow', 'stay', 'cut', 'ahead', 'Olivier', 'Dahan', 'overly', 'slick', 'clever', 'movie', 'mercurial', 'changes', 'one', 'moment', 'mousey', 'woebegone', 'next', 'out-of-control', 'feral', 'cat', 'attack', 'Tomboyish', 'modest', 'international', 'star', 'one', 'moment', 'demanding', 'self-destructive', 'diva', 'next', 'weathered', 'withered', 'little', 'scarecrow', 'one', 'instant', 'noble', 'courageous', 'heroine', 'next', 'body', 'facial', 'language', 'are', 'equally', 'expressive', 'telling', 'story', 'Edith', 'Piaf', 'script', 'sheer', 'rhetoric', 'character.Nevertheless', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'viewer', 'read', 'brief', 'account', 'Edith', 'Piaf', 'life', 'Wickipedia', 'pretty', 'good', 'watching', 'film', 'moving', 'camera', 'place', 'violating', 'temporal-spatial', 'conventions', 'writer-director', 'Dahan', 'embed', 'flashbacks', 'flashbacks', 'requiring', 'viewer', 'keep', 'four', 'more', 'time', 'periods', 'simultaneously', 'mind', 'frequently', 'character', 'identity', 'cases', 'reality', 'remain', 'clueless', 'much', 'later', 'sequence', 'Better', 'get', 'plot-story', 'business', 'way', 'Cotillard', 'extraordinary', 'accomplishment.Unfortunately', 'reason', 'do', 'quick', 'prep', 'Piaf', 'life', 'career', 'viewing', 'film', 'vast', 'majority', 'biopics', 'musicians', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'Charlie', 'Parker', 'Dexter', 'Gordon', 'immediately', 'come', 'mind', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'show', 'why', 'Piaf', 'talent', 'was', 'so', 'special', 'showcase', 'songs', 'manner', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'discovered', 'new', 'generation', 'listeners', 'director', 'assume', 'La', 'Vie', 'en', 'Rose', 'viewer', 'will', 'automatically', 'respond', 'strains', 'Hymn', ""l'Amour"", 'Je', 'Ne', 'Regrette', 'Rien', 'Perhaps', 'majority', 'movie-going', 'public', 'filmmaker', 'little', 'interest', 'let', 'alone', 'knowledge', 'Piaf', 'music', 'Piaf', 'testimony', 'contrary', 'not', 'solely', 'art', 'love', 'Numerous', 'musicians', 'have', 'made', 'sacrifices', 'paid', 'prices', 'similar', 'Piaf', 'was', 'music', 'Great', 'artists', 'have', 'be', 'willing', 'die', 'art', 'not', 'message', 'script', 'Fortunately', 'Cotillard', 'Piaf', 'far', 'more', 'tragic', 'heroine', 'sensationalized', 'story', 'fall', 'star', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'attracted', 'figure', 'who', 'start', 'so', 'undeniably', 'unattractive', 'question', 'continually', 'ask', 'even', 'resonance', 'magnetism', 'character', 'lead', 'ever', 'closer', 'only', 'place', ""'re"", 'likely', 'find', 'answer', 'art.The', 'next', 'move', 'must', 'be', 'spectator']",La Vie en Rose

Take for example Lust For Life, the biography of Vincent Van Gogh or Moulin Rouge, the story of Tolouse La Trec. Or how about Ray, the recent biopic of Ray Charles. Then there's the outstanding Lady Sings The Blues, the life of Billie Holliday. All of these artists were causualties of horrific lives wrought on by years of drug addition, acoholism and in some cases even mental disorders. So what makes these stories so intriging and their lives so compelling? Is it the aspect of viewing a catastophic ""train wreck"" that we can not look away from? Or is it the need for us to try to analyze their work through their suffering? I don't have the answers to these questions. I only know that I sat through two plus hours of La Vie en Rose and I was captivated by both the stellar performance of Marion Cotillard and the incredible artistry of Edith Piaf herself.There are so many reasons to adore this movie.

It's a world where drugs alcohol and illicit sex all coexist among the denizens of the cabarets and brothals. We see their lives consumed by excess with little or no regard for self-preservation. This is the world Edith Piaf came from and never left far behind. No matter what heights she climbed, no matter how much money she earned or how much adulation she received from her fans, she could never cast off her life as a child fending for herself on the streets. She could not escape the pimps, the dope pushers and the street urchins who would not release her from their grasp.

""La Mme"" (""La Vie En Rose"" its US title) is another proud example of my hankering to hear a romantic language spoken amidst spectacular drama and the promised prize of a stupendous performance from Oscar-winning actress Marion Cotillard delivers - her role as the title character is one of the most affecting and heartbreaking I've seen in a long while.The film traces revered French chanteuse Edith Piaf's life from her impoverished childhood all the way to her death in 1963 at the age of 47.  Moving consistently between past and present, the film charts her ascendance from the street to the stage, her many loves and losses and her crippling dependence on alcohol and morphine, the former of which contributed to the liver cancer that caused her premature death.  Piaf was a bleeding heart in the industry though she tried hard to conceal it in the beginning.  Instead, her passion and grief would show itself through her balladry, her chagrin beautifully channeled in songs such as the more notable ""La Vie en Rose"", ""Hymne &agrave; l'amour"" and ""Non, je ne regrette rien"".""La Mme"" is rich in great performances from its actors, particularly that of Marion Cotillard. In the DVD's featurette, Cotillard says her goal in portraying Piaf was not to do an exact imitation, rather to try and understand her ultimate motivation, the depth of Piaf's heart and soul.  It is for this reason that Cotillard manages to disarm the viewer with a portrayal of a woman who used brass to cover her vulnerability and fear, a woman who time and again had her heart broken but managed to stand tall despite it all and pour her heartache into song for her adoring fans.  Excellent supporting players are Sylvie Testus as Piaf's close friend Mmone, Marc Barb&eacute; as the strict Raymond Asso and Emmanuelle Seigner as the maternal Titine.Another strong point of the film is its incredible transformation of the comely Cotillard into the striking Piaf.  A five-hour session in the makeup chair with makeup artist Didier Lavergne (who won an Oscar with Jan Archibald for his ingenious work on the film) metamorphosed Cotillard's angelic face into Piaf's distinguished visage, her scenes in the latter stages of &Eacute;dith's life requiring her to shave her hairline back and shave her eyebrows off to pencil them in.  The scenes of her as a woman aged well beyond her years (at only 44, she looked to be in her 70's) are breathtaking, Lavergne's fantastic work and Dahan's close-ups revealing nothing but the most convincing age-progression makeup ever seen on film.As can be expected, the film is richly layered with Piaf's resonant vocals and confirms the singer's power to move her audience when renowned film actress Marlene Dietrich approaches her after a performance and says wistfully:""I haven't been to Paris for ages.  But this evening, when you were singing, Edith, I was there, in the streets, beneath its sky.  Your voice is the soul of Paris.  You took me on a journey.  You made me cry.""Bottom line: The French - and ONLY the French - could've attempted a story on the magnificent drama of &Eacute;dith Piaf's life, a woman who was idolized in her native country and whose puissant voice is forever synonymous with Parisian culture.  A gem in every way, even a person who hates subtitles must look past it for a rare and perfect portrayal by Cotillard, a performance every bit worthy of her Oscar win.

It always sounded to my untrained ear like she was working very hard to enunciate every word at the expense of any emotion. But she is an icon to the French, so it was probably inevitable someone would one day make a biopic based on her life. That film is ""La Vie En Rose"" starring Marion Cotillard and directed by Olivier Dahan.Edith Piaf, the daughter or a singer and a circus acrobat, is left with her grandmother in the war-torn French countryside in 1917. Her father, on leave from the frontline, returns home and finds Edith sick and dirty, so he takes her to live with his mother, a madam, in her brothel in Normandy. There, she meets Titine (Emmanuel Seigner, ""The Ninth Gate""), a prostitute who helps to nurse Edith back to health and becomes abnormally attached to the little girl. At times she seems to think she is a play doll, at others, her actual daughter. After the war, her father returns and they move out. Her father soon leaves the circus and starts performing on the street. One day, he urges Edith to do something, anything to hold the attention of the crowd and she starts to sing. Her singing captivates the crowd and they throw coins into the collection purse. She earns a few engagements singing in run down dives and then meets a new mentor. He takes her in and hires Marguerite (Marie-Armelle Deguy) to act as an accompanist. They practice and practice and practice. With each word, the mentor stops them and they start again. He continues to admonish her; enunciate each word and sing with your hands. Soon, she appears at a large music hall. Initially, stage fright grips her, but she is eventually able to overcome this and captivate the audience.""La Vie En Rose"" is fairly standard as far as movie biopics go, with one exception. It uses a standard formula to depict the subject's life, guiding us along the path of their life, depicting the most interesting twists and turns. It is even a more standard depiction of a singer. We have seen this type of story before. A bad childhood leads the person in question to become a determined star, always striving to be the best she can be, always desiring to spend as much time on stage as possible. When bad things happen, the subject perseveres, perhaps making her even stronger. On occasion, these moments make them weaker. Every challenge leads to a new song in their repertoire of classics. This is the formula a lot of biopics follow and we know it well. When we such a standard method of storytelling, we begin to hope, to expect that something else will help to compensate for the pedestrian nature of the project.Dahan also uses another familiar technique. We flash back and forward throughout Piaf's life. One moment, we see her on stage in New York City, late in her life, and she is about to sing in front of an audience. Then, we flash back to her childhood, presumably watching her memories as she prepares to go on stage. Then, we flash forward to Piaf, later in life, as she deals with her failing health. This allows the filmmakers to present the subject in an introspective light. If Piaf is on her deathbed, and remembering back to key points in her life, perhaps she is a sympathetic person.This technique is usually reserved for people who were `difficult' in their lives. Piaf fits this label. She treats the people around her, her closest advisors, as helpers, servants. Everything is Piaf's life is about singing and singing well. If people who are helping her achieve these goals don't understand that, they can leave. She rants and raves at more than one of her trusted aides on more than one occasion. There is only one time in the film when she truly appears to be nice and that is when she falls in love. The rest of the time, she is one extreme emotion after another. Because of this, she doesn't come off as very nice and we don't have a lot of sympathy for her. Dahan seems to recognize this and tries to create sympathy for her by showing how frail and sickly she is later in her life.The film has a definite rhythm. A snippet of Piaf's life is followed by a moment of reflection later in her life. Then we get a song. The songs are used to punctuate her life story, to underscore the emotions she is feeling at a particular point. Late in the film, and her life, as Piaf is preparing to perform after a long absence, she meets two songwriters who sing a song for her. She immediately latches onto the lyrics because they form a sort of synopsis of what she is feeling at that point in her life. This is the most overt example of this technique, but it helps to illustrate the feel of the film.When a filmmaker uses such a conventional narrative for the story, they spend their efforts on production design. ""Rose"" is no exception. The film spans the course of almost five decades and faithfully recreates the French countryside during World War I, Paris during World War II and New York and California during the 50s. The production design is very good and very complete, helping to transport us to these places and these times.""Rose"" is a very typical biopic with one exception. Marion Cotillard seems to have been possessed by the spirit of her subject. We have seen many amazing performances recreating a musician's life; Jamie Foxx did a great job as Ray Charles, Angela Bassett did a great job as Tina Turner, Reese Witherspoon did a great job as June Carter Cash. While all of these performances were great, and they had occasional moments when the performer seems to be channeling the spirit of their subject, Cotilard is possessed throughout.From the moment Cotillard first appears as Piaf, you get the sense you are going to visit with the singer, she is going to sit with you and tell you about her life. Part of this is because Cotillard gives such a bravura performance. She makes Piaf her own, for good or for bad, and helps us to see all of the trials the singer went through. Part of the reason I didn't like Edith Piaf very much is because Cotillard does a great job of recreating the singer's life, her rants, her loves and her good and bad points. This is also part of the reason the film is less than perfect. She is so good at portraying Piaf, warts and all, that she wants to show us the bad bits as well. It doesn't matter if these moments change our opinion of the French Icon. She seems to be Piaf, as much as my limited knowledge of the singer can define.Piaf apparently only had one true love in her life. And we know this because she says it many times after she meets Marcel (Jean-Pierre Martins), a French boxer who she meets when she relocates to New York during World War II. This is the one moment when we actually get a glimpse at another side of Piaf. She is madly in love with the athlete and he seems to return her affections. As soon as they meet, she becomes a completely different person, a nice person, someone we might want to know. This was, for me, the best part of the film because Cotillard portrays Piaf's love in such an unabashed, puppy dog style I almost fell in love. But as with any other singer featured in a biopic, this love will not last.Cotillard helps us to realize that Piaf had a huge amount of talent, whether we like her or not. And for this, ""La Vie En Rose"" is worth a viewing by the singer's most devoted fans. But the film runs a long 140 minutes, and this makes it a stretch for the rest of us. A long stretch best served at home, while watching the film on DVD.",3,2 1/2 - Standard Biopic of Someone We Have Difficulty Caring For,1184198400,"07 12, 2007",2007,7558,"['have', 'heard',

The film also captures the background of &#34;Belleville&#34;, still a working class quarter in Paris, and the &#34;milieu&#34; that she was front.

In fact, like Holliday, it's sadly part of her allure; however, this film allows us to see just how those tragedies ultimately shaped her not only as a human being but as an artist, whose singing always managed to convey like few others, the joys and sorrows of life.  This is the kind of film that I will watch only once, as it's too intense to make for casual, repeated viewing, but, nevertheless, it should be seen by anyone interested in brilliant acting, screenwriting, production design and, of course, Piaf fans, whom are legion.  Cotillard commits to celluloid one of the most memorable performances by an actress, rivaling Streep in Sophie's Choice, Leigh in Streetcar Named Desire, Swank in Boys Don't Cry, Theron in Monster and Hepburn in Long Day's Journey Into Night.  The moment she learns of Marcel's fate is so finely delivered that you will find yourself undone by her overwhelming sense of loss and desperation.  From her more than humble beginnings as a sickly child, abandoned in her grandmother's Normandy brothel, to her life in the circus and street performer whose raw talent catches the attention of the impresario Leplee, to her bouts with addiction and ensuing tragedies to her worldwide fame, that to this day is nothing short of iconic, we're here shown a Piaf that is brilliant, tortured, determined, fractured but always believing that love is life's greatest gift and that at all moments in life, one most believe in it.  The cinematography by Nagata is amazing with 1930's Paris and New York jumping off the screen.  You will never hear a Piaf song the same way again.
