673102,A2ZS8TWUL1QTRH,B00005OW09,A.J. Dill,"[2, 17]","I made a mistake with this series. I borrowed Volume 4 from a friend of mine to check out the series. It contained the episode where you first meet Legato, a very dark, cruel man who can control what people's bodies, literally. I thought the series was going to be fantastic- a perfect balance between action, a dark plot, and a little comedy.Then I bought the DVD set.I have to admit, I was disappointed by the series. In the first nine episodes, the show appears to be a comedy. Even when the plot becomes more dark with people dying and cities being demolished, the show still tries to be funny. It felt out of place sometimes. The odd looking funny faces also were overdone a little bit.The second half of the show goes more in depth with the plot. But as it turns out, my favorite enemy, Legato, is not the Vash's arch nemesis. That also greatly disappointed me.Other than the show being unbalanced in comedy and in plot development, I found it to be pretty good. There is some pretty good gun action; some episodes have a lot of it while others are a little sparse. I also had quite a few laughs in the beginning with Vash's childlike behavior. I couldn't help falling in love with all the characters since they are full of personality. I'm just sad the show didn't live up to my expectations. It's worth buying the import version of the show even if episode navigation is just as complex as a jigsaw puzzle.",3,Something's WRONG with those funny faces!,1110931200,"03 16, 2005",2005,1414,"['made', 'mistake', 'series', 'borrowed', 'Volume', '4', 'friend', 'mine', 'check', 'out', 'series', 'contained', 'episode', 'where', 'first', 'meet', 'Legato', 'very', 'dark', 'cruel', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'control', 'what', 'people', 'bodies', 'literally', 'thought', 'series', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'fantastic-', 'perfect', 'balance', 'action', 'dark', 'plot', 'little', 'comedy.Then', 'bought', 'DVD', 'set.I', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'disappointed', 'series', 'first', 'nine', 'episodes', 'show', 'be', 'comedy', 'Even', 'when', 'plot', 'more', 'dark', 'people', 'dying', 'cities', 'being', 'demolished', 'show', 'still', 'be', 'funny', 'felt', 'place', 'sometimes', 'odd', 'looking', 'funny', 'also', 'were', 'little', 'bit.The', 'second', 'half', 'show', 'more', 'depth', 'plot', 'out', 'favorite', 'enemy', 'Legato', 'not', 'Vash', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'also', 'greatly', 'disappointed', 'me.Other', 'show', 'being', 'unbalanced', 'comedy', 'plot', 'development', 'found', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'pretty', 'good', 'gun', 'action', 'episodes', 'have', 'lot', 'others', 'are', 'little', 'sparse', 'also', 'had', 'quite', 'few', 'laughs', 'beginning', 'Vash', 'childlike', 'behavior', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'falling', 'love', 'characters', 'are', 'full', 'personality', ""'m"", 'just', 'sad', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'worth', 'buying', 'import', 'version', 'show', 'even', 'episode', 'navigation', 'just', 'as', 'complex', 'jigsaw', 'puzzle']",N/A

Vash the Stampede, dubbed the ""Humanoid Typhoon"" is the perfect hero.  He tries to go through life without killing even though there are always people trying to kill him for the 60 billion double dollar bounty on his head.  He gets into impossible situations, and generally manages to handle them without hurting anyone, and that is part of what makes him so lovable.  I think this is a must-have for any anime collector because it's got everything and isn't completely weighted down with tragedy.  There are some absolutely hilarious moments in just about every episode, and you get the love the characters (well most of them anyway!).  You meet insurance girls, Millie and Meryl, that are determined to minimize the damage that Vash causes.  There is Wolfwood, the traveling priest who is more enigmatic than the first encounter would have you believe.

Trigun is a must buy if you are looking for a great series.  As usual Amazon offers great prices.  Some reviewers are complaining that the box set does not have extra features.

673109,A4VH04TA14CPE,B00005OW09,"Angry Mofo ""angrymofo""","[0, 1]","The main character of Trigun is an outlaw in a Wild-West-type setting who has superhuman reflexes and accuracy. By itself, this is not particularly new as a premise for an anime. But then, this master gunslinger is shown to be a committed pacifist who refuses to kill, and willingly exposes himself to greater danger in the hope of finding a non-lethal solution.This concept subverts the foundations of an action show. It's especially potent since the show takes Vash's principles very seriously. He genuinely and deeply suffers at the mere thought of having to break his code, yet never wavers in his adherence to it. And he gets pushed very hard, particularly in the second half of the show, where each new conflict makes it more difficult for him to avoid killing. He pays the cost of his choices, too -- his entire body is covered with scars. But he persists.This is very compelling. You are not asked to agree with Vash's philosophy. In fact, most of the other ""good"" or likable characters either cannot bear the rigour of such a code, or (in the case of anti-hero Nicholas Wolfwood) openly criticize what they perceive as Vash's naivete. Most viewers would probably tend to agree with this more realistic view. But Vash's moral rigour still earns one's admiration, since he bears its full burden. Where most other TV shows and movies try to find excuses for their protagonists to indulge their destructive impulses, Trigun goes for a rise, and makes its hero hold himself to an impossibly high standard.The show also avoids the trap of making the hero seem annoyingly perfect. In the first half of the show, Vash is shown to be a goofball who makes a fool of himself on numerous occasions, and needs guidance from more level-headed characters. Sometimes he acts this way on purpose, to avoid having to argue or fight. But when the show comes back around to Vash's code, it is never less than completely serious.Unfortunately, aside from the premise, much of the show suffers from numerous anime conventions. Most notably, the villains are boring. Vash's arch-nemesis Knives (who came up with this name?) is a cardboard cut-out. The show attempts to give him some back-story to explain his evil, but the explanation is not remotely convincing. He started out normal, was then emotionally abused by one of the crew members (while all the others defended him), and instantly switched to psychotic hatred of all humans. All of his lines thereafter are the usual megalomaniacal rants about how humans are imperfect. Yawn. His minion Legato follows the ""effete evil genius"" stereotype, with his own trite rants about how everyone is a pawn on a chessboard that he bought and owns. Likemanysuper-villains, he is implausibly brilliant, with the ability to precisely plan his enemy's downfall and anticipate every counter-move. Only at the very end does he get anything interesting to do, when he tries to use Vash's code against him.Trigun also has some problems with pacing. The later episodes have a villain-of-the-week format, where one barely has time to register a new enemy's name, super power, and catch-phrase before the enemy finds a way to die. These episodes also try to cram way too much back-story into a short space of time. To be honest, I don't know that we really needed to know Vash's origin story. He's interesting for how he acts, not where he came from. His fragmented visions of Rem don't really gain any extra pathos after you learn who she is; they might as well have just left them as an unexplained mystery. The gradual shift in focus to Vash's conflict with Knives as the centerpiece of the show also means that the neat Wild-West setting fades into the background. After some time, every new episode has a new town which gets destroyed (or sometimes saved) and then is never heard from again. It might have been better to show Vash as aman-with-no-name(but with a cause), having to deal with the show's lawless world. The more memorable villains are the ones who are vicious, but have mostly recognizable human motivations like greed.The first half of the show is generally more enjoyable (and also lighter). The second half rushes through lots of plot details, but does have one major dramatic payoff in Vash's showdown with Legato. The final battle with Knives is anti-climactic by comparison, since it doesn't tie into Vash's identity in such a powerful way. The writing in the show tends to be very declarative, with the dubbed voices woodenly reciting long speeches, but unfortunately this is another common anime convention, and you sort of have to ignore it if you are going to watch things like this. That sums up the show as a whole -- if you have a high tolerance for anime cliches, you have an easy point of entry, and you can enjoy the truly novel and thought-provoking parts of the show. If not, you might find it more difficult.",3,"Unique protagonist and premise, with some cliches.",1377388800,"08 25, 2013",2013,4868,"['main', 'character', 'Trigun', 'outlaw', 'Wild-West-type', 'setting', 'who', 'superhuman', 'reflexes', 'accuracy', 'not', 'particularly', 'new', 'premise', 'anime', 'then', 'master', 'gunslinger', 'shown', 'be', 'committed', 'pacifist', 'who', 'kill', 'willingly', 'greater', 'danger', 'hope', 'finding', 'non-lethal', 'solution.This', 'concept', 'foundations', 'action', 'show', 'especially', 'potent', 'show', 'Vash', 'principles', 'very', 'seriously', 'genuinely', 'deeply', 'suffers', 'mere', 'thought', 'having', 'break', 'code', 'yet', 'never', 'wavers', 'adherence', 'pushed', 'very', 'hard', 'particularly', 'second', 'half', 'show', 'where', 'new', 'conflict', 'more', 'difficult', 'avoid', 'killing', 'cost', 'choices', 'too', 'entire', 'body', 'covered', 'scars', 'very', 'compelling', 'are', 'not', 'asked', 'agree', 'Vash', 'philosophy', 'fact', 'most', 'other', 'good', 'likable', 'characters', 'can', 'not', 'bear', 'rigour', 'such', 'code', 'case', 'anti-hero', 'Nicholas', 'Wolfwood', 'openly', 'criticize', 'what', 'perceive', 'Vash', 'naivete', 'Most', 'viewers', 'would', 'probably', 'tend', 'agree', 'more', 'realistic', 'view', 'Vash', 'moral', 'rigour', 'still', 'one', 'admiration', 'full', 'burden', 'Where', 'most', 'other', 'TV', 'shows', 'movies', 'try', 'find', 'excuses', 'protagonists', 'indulge', 'destructive', 'impulses', 'Trigun', 'rise', 'hero', 'hold', 'impossibly', 'high', 'standard.The', 'show', 'also', 'trap', 'making', 'hero', 'seem', 'annoyingly', 'perfect', 'first', 'half', 'show', 'Vash', 'shown', 'be', 'goofball', 'who', 'fool', 'numerous', 'occasions', 'needs', 'guidance', 'more', 'level-headed', 'characters', 'Sometimes', 'way', 'purpose', 'avoid', 'having', 'argue', 'fight', 'when', 'show', 'back', 'Vash', 'code', 'never', 'less', 'completely', 'serious.Unfortunately', 'aside', 'premise', 'much', 'show', 'numerous', 'anime', 'conventions', 'Most', 'notably', 'villains', 'are', 'boring', 'Vash', 'arch-nemesis', 'Knives', 'who', 'came', 'up', 'name', 'cardboard', 'cut-out', 'show', 'give', 'back-story', 'explain', 'evil', 'explanation', 'not', 'remotely', 'convincing', 'started', 'out', 'normal', 'was', 'then', 'emotionally', 'abused', 'one', 'crew', 'members', 'others', 'defended', 'instantly', 'switched', 'psychotic', 'hatred', 'humans', 'lines', 'thereafter', 'are', 'usual', 'megalomaniacal', 'rants', 'how', 'humans', 'are', 'imperfect', 'Yawn', 'minion', 'Legato', 'effete', 'evil', 'genius', 'stereotype', 'own', 'trite', 'rants', 'how', 'everyone', 'pawn', 'chessboard', 'bought', 'Likemanysuper-villains', 'implausibly', 'brilliant', 'ability', 'precisely', 'plan', 'enemy', 'downfall', 'anticipate', 'counter-move', 'Only', 'very', 'end', 'get', 'anything', 'interesting', 'do', 'when', 'use', 'Vash', 'code', 'him.Trigun', 'also', 'problems', 'pacing', 'later', 'episodes', 'have', 'villain-of-the-week', 'format', 'where', 'one', 'barely', 'time', 'register', 'new', 'enemy', 'name', 'super', 'power', 'catch-phrase', 'enemy', 'way', 'die', 'episodes', 'also', 'try', 'cram', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'back-story', 'short', 'space', 'time', 'be', 'honest', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'really', 'needed', 'know', 'Vash', 'origin', 'story', 'interesting', 'how', 'not', 'where', 'came', 'fragmented', 'visions', 'Rem', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'gain', 'extra', 'pathos', 'learn', 'who', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'just', 'left', 'unexplained', 'mystery', 'gradual', 'shift', 'focus', 'Vash', 'conflict', 'Knives', 'centerpiece', 'show', 'also', 'neat', 'Wild-West', 'setting', 'fades', 'background', 'time', 'new', 'episode', 'new', 'town', 'destroyed', 'sometimes', 'saved', 'then', 'never', 'heard', 'again', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'show', 'Vash', 'aman-with-no-name', 'cause', 'having', 'deal', 'show', 'lawless', 'world', 'more', 'memorable', 'villains', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'vicious', 'have', 'mostly', 'recognizable', 'human', 'motivations', 'greed.The', 'first', 'half', 'show', 'generally', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'also', 'lighter', 'second', 'half', 'rushes', 'lots', 'plot', 'details', 'have', 'one', 'major', 'dramatic', 'payoff', 'Vash', 'showdown', 'Legato', 'final', 'battle', 'Knives', 'anti-climactic', 'comparison', ""n't"", 'tie', 'Vash', 'identity', 'such', 'powerful', 'way', 'writing', 'show', 'be', 'very', 'declarative', 'dubbed', 'voices', 'woodenly', 'reciting', 'long', 'speeches', 'unfortunately', 'common', 'anime', 'convention', 'sort', 'have', 'ignore', 'are', 'going', 'watch', 'things', 'sums', 'up', 'show', 'whole', 'have', 'high', 'tolerance', 'anime', 'cliches', 'have', 'easy', 'point', 'entry', 'can', 'enjoy', 'truly', 'novel', 'thought-provoking', 'parts', 'show', 'not', 'might', 'find', 'more', 'difficult']",N/A

673112,A3J5JTEB1OPT2Z,B00005OW09,Assaf Tal,"[2, 5]","I will not repeat the premise of the show, since that can befound in the other reviews and amazon's own summary. Instead,let me address the question that really interests the buyer:is this show worth the money or not?First of all let me agree with some of the other (negative)reviewers: the sophistication of Trigun is nowhere nearthat of Cowboy Bebop. If you are therefore purchasing thisexpecting another show on that level, forget it. You won'tbe getting any, not technically (soundtrack, art, animation)and not artistically (script, directing).But this does not bar Trigun from having its own personalcharm. The characters are not deep but they are well written andinteract nicely. It is safe to say that the characters, asalways, are the saving grace of this show. They really manageto keep it going.Unfortunately the show suffers from all the cliches andbad script problems that almost all other animes out theresuffer from. To name a few:1. Excessive use of flashbacks, which show Vash as a littleboy. Well, not as excessive as most other animes, butthey occupy an episode and a half, which is way too much.2. Immature storyline - ok, the storyline is fun, but it'sstill immature. Basically, Vash fights a succession ofbad guys until he reaches the final bad guy. The seriesculminates in a big shoot out. This is typical comic-bookwriting. It works but it's certainly not high level. Youwon't be getting any intense drama.3. Visual humor & slapstick - animes are (in)famous forusing a lot of slapstick. This one isn't an exception.It's not as bad as ""man slips on a banana peel"" but attimes (not always!) the humor is more ""the three stooges""than ""Seinfeld"" or ""Monty Python"" or (insert other highlevel humor source here).4. Impossible situations and stupid villians. In one of theepisodes Vash fights a huge giant which shoots out itsfist. Come on, is that for real? The villians are morecomic book villians than real ones. They are alsooften insulting - if you want me to feel a real senseof conflict, bring a real villian. I think I've maturedbeyond ""Godzilla"" and ""King Kong"" and I demand that alittle more thought be put into my villians.Nevertheless, the show is not a collection of drivel and lunacy. It has its strong moments. As a whole it can definitely beconsidered entertaining.

It will definitely catch your attention from episode 1 with its awesome comedy, but this show is sheer brilliance.Vash is not the type of hero or outlaw that we expect him to be. He is silly and seems extremely clumsy, but that is his brilliance, he catches you off-guard and purposefully tries to make you think that his adversaries have the upper hand.Despite some awesome laughs, this show has a great story. The more you watch, the more that you will come to better understand the hidden story and why Vash is the way that he is. He may seem silly and goofy, but he hides pain and has a purpose and he intends to fix something that had occurred in the past. This is most definitely an anime classic for the way that it catches your attention, makes you laugh, and then gradually reveals a dark and twisted story. This anime gradually makes its way into your heart and forever remains with you. Whether it is the laughs, the awesome-yet ridiculous fight scenes, the characters, or the hidden story, something will remain with you and make you love this show.I highly recommend this show because it is full of so many surprises.

Maybe that's because the script writers are using ""The seeker of the mayflower of peace"" are a commentary about the inherent contradictions in the U.S. culture regarding peace and violence.  The writers accurately catch the fact that most everyone in the ""Beautiful Country"" (the Chinese characters used to represent the U.S.) is raised Christian, Jewish, Buddhist or other religions that have doctrinal opposition to violence.  Nonetheless, the ""Beautiful Country"" is frequently involved in conflict, almost in spite of itself.So too, Vash The Humanoid Typhoon, while he wants peace, is constantly located where massive destruction has taken place, and it is never his fault.  He meditates diligently for several seconds, another sly slam on American students who would like to study Asian disciplines like martial arts and yet don't come from a culture that instills them with a prolonged discipline.The beautiful irony in this series is that it is most loved by the people it mocks.  This series catches the inherent contradictions of seeking peace in world which remains uncivil.  It is like the quote from Apocalypse Now, ""It was a way we had of dealing with ourselves over here. We cut people in half with a .50 cal and then give them a band-aid for the wound.""  Or the soldier in Full Metal Jacket who has a Peace symbol on his helmet.

Vash is that he is a drifter and every town he goes into gets pulverized. So there's a large reward for his capture, but nobody in the story really know who he is or what he looks like.

He acts so dumb, that people have trouble believing that he really is who he claims to be. We later find out that the destruction of the towns is caused by the bounty hunters trying to kill him; not by Vash's actions. He mostly survives the destruction either out of luck or his inhuman dodging skills. He's very agile and has amazing reflexes that allow him to dodge bullets and avoid explosions. Even more surprising when he shows off is marksmanship. Each episode has Vash traveling to different towns and meeting interesting characters with funny stories.

I myself fell subject to that buzz, and made the mistake to purchasing what was purported to be a great anime series.  Imagine my disappointment when I discovered that the misadventures of Vash the Stampede were mindless, poorly written and poorly executed drivel.Don't get me wrong, I tried to like the show, I really did.  In fact, I found the opening episode to be quite strong and interesting.  In it, we are introduced to a man (Vash) called the Humanoid Typhoon, who has been deemed so dangerous that authorities have placed a 60 billion double dollar bounty on his head.  Destruction seems to follow wherever Vash goes despite his best efforts, and miraculously no one has ever died, though cities have been leveled.  The episode is well animated and combines action and humor in a very interesting and entertaining way, so naturally I had high hopes for the series.Then I saw the second episode.  Apparently the entire animation budget was used on the first episode, because the action sequences here have about two frames of animation.  Which would be forgivable if the story wasn't so uninteresting and just downright boring.  But that's alright, not every episode can be great, right?Unfortunately episodes three through seven aren't much better.  Things get slightly more interesting with a two-parter involving a highjacked sandsteamer, but then the show slips back into its slump.  The animation continues to be pathetic and nowhere near as good as other shows from the mid-to-late nineties, and the stories are so poorly written they are almost laughable.  And the endearing klutziness of Vash from the first episode is played up so much that it becomes grating, while the cool hero side of his character all but disappears.About midway through the series, a gang of hitmen called the Gung Ho Guns appears, and their attacks on Vash provide some interesting if shakily executed storylines.  However, thier mindgames with Vash soon wear thin, but all the while I hold out hope that once the much talked about Knives appears things will get better.  Unfortunately, by the time Knives does appear in episode twenty-four or five, the series is far past help.Trigun does have an interesting premise, and the manga its based on is excellent.  However, the anime enscrews all that made the manga entertaining.  The anime severly downplays the action (probably due to budget constraints) while spending far too much time focusing on the more annoying character traits.  Vash as a tortured soul is all but foresaken in favor of Vash the klutz, and the two insurance girls who follow him around are supremely annoying.  The anime also shies away from its source material's darker tone, which contrasted so beautifully with the moments of comedy.  Adding insult to injury, Pioneer insists on selling the box set for the absurb $200 MSRP, a mere forty dollars less than buying the volumes individually.Long story short, the Trigun anime is a case study in wasted potential.  Poor animation and writing coupled with annoying characterizations all but criple the show.  Buy the manga instead, and if you simply MUST see Trigun animated watch the reruns on Cartoon Network late at night.",2,"Well, at Least the Manga is Good...",1092182400,"08 11, 2004",2004,3266,"['Trigun', 'one', 'series', 'lot', 'lip', 'service', 'anime', 'fans', 'fell', 'subject', 'buzz', 'made', 'mistake', 'purchasing', 'what', 'was', 'purported', 'be', 'great', 'anime', 'series', 'Imagine', 'disappointment', 'when', 'discovered', 'misadventures', 'Vash', 'Stampede', 'were', 'mindless', 'poorly', 'written', 'poorly', 'executed', 'drivel.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'tried', 'like', 'show', 'really', 'did', 'fact', 'found', 'opening', 'episode', 'be', 'quite', 'strong', 'interesting', 'are', 'introduced', 'man', 'Vash', 'called', 'Humanoid', 'Typhoon', 'who', 'been', 'deemed', 'so', 'dangerous', 'authorities', 'have', 'placed', '60', 'billion', 'double', 'dollar', 'bounty', 'head', 'Destruction', 'follow', 'wherever', 'Vash', 'best', 'efforts', 'miraculously', 'one', 'ever', 'died', 'cities', 'have', 'been', 'leveled', 'episode', 'well', 'animated', 'combines', 'action', 'humor', 'very', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'way', 'naturally', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'series.Then', 'saw', 'second', 'episode', 'Apparently', 'entire', 'animation', 'budget', 'was', 'used', 'first', 'episode', 'action', 'sequences', 'here', 'have', 'about', 'two', 'frames', 'animation', 'Which', 'would', 'be', 'forgivable', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'uninteresting', 'just', 'downright', 'boring', 'alright', 'not', 'episode', 'can', 'be', 'great', 'right', 'Unfortunately', 'three', 'seven', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', 'Things', 'get', 'slightly', 'more', 'interesting', 'two-parter', 'involving', 'highjacked', 'sandsteamer', 'then', 'show', 'back', 'slump', 'animation', 'be', 'pathetic', 'nowhere', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'shows', 'mid-to-late', 'nineties', 'stories', 'are', 'so', 'poorly', 'written', 'are', 'almost', 'laughable', 'endearing', 'klutziness', 'Vash', 'first', 'episode', 'played', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'grating', 'cool', 'hero', 'side', 'character', 'disappears.About', 'midway', 'series', 'gang', 'hitmen', 'called', 'Gung', 'Ho', 'Guns', 'attacks', 'Vash', 'provide', 'interesting', 'shakily', 'executed', 'storylines', 'However', 'thier', 'mindgames', 'Vash', 'soon', 'wear', 'thin', 'while', 'hold', 'out', 'hope', 'once', 'much', 'talked', 'Knives', 'things', 'will', 'get', 'better', 'Unfortunately', 'time', 'appear', 'episode', 'twenty-four', 'five', 'series', 'far', 'past', 'help.Trigun', 'have', 'interesting', 'premise', 'manga', 'based', 'excellent', 'However', 'anime', 'made', 'manga', 'entertaining', 'anime', 'severly', 'action', 'probably', 'due', 'budget', 'constraints', 'spending', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'focusing', 'more', 'annoying', 'character', 'traits', 'Vash', 'tortured', 'soul', 'foresaken', 'favor', 'Vash', 'klutz', 'two', 'insurance', 'girls', 'who', 'follow', 'around', 'are', 'supremely', 'annoying', 'anime', 'also', 'away', 'source', 'material', 'darker', 'tone', 'contrasted', 'so', 'beautifully', 'moments', 'comedy', 'Adding', 'insult', 'injury', 'Pioneer', 'selling', 'box', 'set', 'absurb', '200', 'MSRP', 'mere', 'forty', 'dollars', 'less', 'buying', 'volumes', 'individually.Long', 'story', 'short', 'Trigun', 'anime', 'case', 'study', 'wasted', 'potential', 'Poor', 'animation', 'writing', 'coupled', 'annoying', 'characterizations', 'criple', 'show', 'Buy', 'manga', 'instead', 'simply', 'MUST', 'see', 'Trigun', 'animated', 'watch', 'reruns', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'late', 'night']",N/A
673134,A1ZSOK69XSXF73,B00005OW09,"Duckman ""Morbid Cynic""","[4, 53]","First of all, before I start reviewing this anime, keep in mind that I haven't seen this anime since 2003, so I can't remember every name of every character or some episodes, but I remember enough to have a well-rounded opinion of it.I saw the English-dubbed version of Trigun on Adult Swim seven years ago, and I hated it.  I still hate it now, but my reasoning for it has changed after sitting down and thinking about the anime much deeper than before in recent years.  Concerning the ""classic 90's anime,"" Trigun easily fits within the top 3 in the ""most overrated department,"" along with Neon Genesis Evangelion and Tenchi Muyo.STORYThe story for Trigun is that a mysterious gunman named Vash the Stampede roams a largely desolate planet called Gunsmoke and causes destruction everywhere he goes, even though he doesn't intend to do so.  Vash has a gigantic bounty on his head and lots of bounty hunters, including a psychotic genocidal freak named Knives and his minions named the ""Gun-ho Guns"" are out to get him.TONAL AND STYLISTIC INCONSISTENCYI'll be frank and say the tonal and stylistic inconsistencies are essentially the ""death sentence"" for Trigun, because it taints just about every aspect of this anime and makes it so unenjoyable (these faults are also the primary reasons why I hate Neon Genesis Evangelion, but that's another review).  It's like the writers of Trigun couldn't decide between making a cartoonish and light-hearted shoot em' up anime or being a serious action anime with plenty of drama and elaboration of clashing philosophies, so they settled upon the worst option and chose both.  I HATE it when people do this because I watch serious anime to GET AWAY from the comedic stuff.  Mixing serious and comedic tones in anime is like mixing acids with bases, the results are almost always disastrous.PLOTTINGThe plotting in this anime is also victim of the tonal inconsistencies because the anime starts off on the light-hearted, cartoonish side but steadily progresses into something largely serious.  This doesn't sit well with me because I want the tone of a series or movie to be largely consistent and if there is variation, the variation has to be moderate.CHARACTERSContrary to the gobs of gushing reviews, most of the characters aren't works of art.  People everywhere have lauded how ""complex"" Vash the Stampede's character is.  Yes, in a technical sense, his character is complex, but you have to remember that every quality has its good and bad sides.  Vash's character is very inconsistent, because he'll act like a loud circus clown then out of nowhere, he'll turn into a whiny pacifist who eats doughnuts and constantly bleats ""No one has the right to kill another,"" and in some rare instances, he'll turn into a tough-as-nails gunman who doesn't kill the bad guy at the last minute because he just remembered it was ""wrong.""  Vash's character is comparable to a dish of cottage cheese, powdered milk, boiled tofu, chicken salad, sweet potatoes, cheap Mexican beer, and chopped liver; they're both complex, but they're certainly not good.  Now, some ""contrasting"" personalities can add depth to a character's main personality, but those other personalities should be there only to complement the main one and be moderate in tone, NOT to share equal space or overpower the main one because it makes the character look very awkward in an unpleasant way.  An example of Vash's inconsistent personality is in one episode where Vash is on a space station and one of the Gun-ho Guns is aboard as well, gunning down helpless people.  However, there's plenty of scenes with Vash ""navigating"" through the space station by using his arm-mounted machine gun to shoot giant holes through the space station floors and while he falls, he screams and makes a big dumb face.  Now mixing that loud and dull visual comedy with helpless people being executed like that doesn't sit well with me because it makes the comedic and somber tones feel cheap and undermined.  Another is when a senile midget controlling a giant guy with projectile fists is destroying everything, Vash puts on his ""serious"" tone and stops the old guy and his living weapon, but after that's done, he starts acting like a clown and starts yelling ""The world is made of love and peace"" with a bunch of kids.  Hand me a barf bag.  In previous years, I loathed Vash's pacifist philosophy just because he refused to kill people, but that's largely changed now.  The protagonist doesn't have to kill every bad guy in order to gain my personal approval now, but the fact that Vash is constantly harping about his beliefs pushes me to the other side and makes me want to jump into the Trigun universe and subject all the bad guys to the same treatment Isaac Clarke dishes out to the Necromorphs in Dead Space just to horribly spite Vash.  After some mental re-evaluation on certain plot points in Trigun, I was screaming to myself in one of Vash's ""killing people is wrong"" speeches ""ALRIGHT, WE GET IT!!  SHUT UP!!""  It doesn't help that in the English dub, Vash is voiced by Johnny Yong Bosche, who has one of the most unpleasant and whiny voices I've ever heard in any medium.  Some characters like Wolfwood and Knives are actually pretty interesting because they largely maintain a consistent tone (and thankfully, they're more on the serious side), but the consistent characters are unfortunately, less in abundance compared to the inconsistent ones.  Meryll Stryfe and Millie Thompson weren't terribly impressive characters because they seemed like all too conventional cutouts of the ""George and Lenny"" dynamic in the John Steinbeck classic Of Mice and Men, other than the occasional moments of Meryll screaming her head off in a comedic style (these moments aren't funny to begin with).THEMESThere's some potentially good themes in Trigun about the clashing philosophies between Vash and Knives since the former doesn't believe anyone should be killed, while the latter believes in something closer to eugenics as to where all the ""weak and stupid"" should be killed so the superior creatures can live in a ""better world.""  I also like how in one flashback episode where Vash and Knives are kids, Vash sees a spider web with a moth being stuck on it and a spider getting ready to eat it, but Knives kills the spider.  Vash protests and says he should have saved the moth instead, but Knives's justification is pretty interesting because it was pretty legitimate, which was ""If I save the moth, the spider will starve.""  Sadly, these themes are undermined by the well-established tonal inconsistencies.APPEARANCEThe animation and artwork is actually pretty good, and it shows another quality product from Madhouse Studio (only speaking about production).  The animation is pretty smooth and the artwork is nicely detailed, though I'd say this is one of Madhouse's lower-quality products (along with that overrated saccharine pukefest Chobits and the ever-so-worthless Devil May Cry).  However, more inconsistencies lay in here as well.  Vash makes really goofy exaggerated faces throughout the series (along with many other characters), such as when Vash defeats the main bad guy in the first episode, he makes a cat face when he says something like ""Some toys are fun, but you can get hurt.""  Also, for an anime with villains that do pretty terrible things, some of the villains' appearances undermine the grim moments since they look like something ripped out of Power Rangers (yuck).SOUNDTRACKThe soundtrack is okay, I guess, nothing special.  I honestly don't remember much of it other than some Western-sounding acoustic guitar riffs and some riffing more on the electric and funky side.  I wasn't impressed the last time I heard Trigun's music, but the music wasn't anything offensive, so I guess that's a plus.FINAL WORDWhile Trigun isn't nearly as bad as say, Elfen Lied or Fullmetal Alchemist, it's still a really wretched title.  Trigun is a classic case of ""what could have been.""  Had this anime maintained a serious tone and focused on the clashing philosophies of Vash and Knives and didn't waste time with gobs of redundant comedic filler, this could have been the ""great"" anime that legions of people are hailing it as.  If you like comedy mixed with serious tones, then you may like this.  However, if you're like me and HATE mixing the two, skip Trigun since you won't get anything out if it that you can get from numerous other titles that are much superior.  If you want some decent light-hearted/comedic anime, go get yourself some Devil Hunter Yokho and Excel Saga (at least they both maintain consistency).  I suggest you go watch Perfect Blue, Battle Angel, Neo-Tokyo, Shigurui:  Death Frenzy, Jin-Roh, and Ghost in the Shell for some quality ""mature"" anime.",1,One of the best anime titles ever?

They were on tv so I could watch them for free. At 15 a friend of mine started to collect the Trigun series. I immediately fell in love with the characters and felt myself relating to Vash quite a bit. Because of this anime I have been hooked ever since and keep looking for a show that will be as good as trigun is.The series starts with a silly feel, the characters being quite goofy at times. This draws you into the series and allows you to enjoy getting to know the characters. Later in the series one of these characters dies, this almost moved me to tears the first time I saw it and still makes me very sad every time I do. It does end in a dark place, but does retain certain silly moments that just make you which fits the characters.This is a show that is good no matter your age. I love it today just as much as I did when I was 15.All around this is my favorite anime. It really sucks you in and makes you fall in love with the world they created.

This statement is probably true to a degree if we want to get into art and intrensic deep meaning and symbolism, but for animes that are just enjoyable to watch and poignient when they need to be, Trigun is one of the best.Vash the Stampede is a wanted criminal. Wanted for a lot of money for supposedly doing a lot of crimes. Two insurance agents, Meryle and Milly do their best to catch up with the outlaw, but when they do, they realize that Vash is a bit of a goof ball who not only hates bloodshed, but has never even killed anyone and refuses to kill even animals. Added to the mix is Wolfwood, a hedonistic priest with a painfully sketchy past. Vash is eventually pitted against his twin brother, a truly evil mastermind, and a psychotic telepathic, Legato, who is possibly one of the slickest, most threatening insane villains in anime.As I've said, there are deeper animes, but Trigun can get pretty deep in and of itself. Vash is desperate to avenge the death of this lover, Wolfwood is trying to figure out just what it means to be a ""good guy"" and his path to redemption is truly heartbreaking, Legato is bent on destruction and his final revenge on Vash is painful to watch since he does the one thing that will make Vash hurt more than anything else done in the series. There is a lot of humor, but there are also truly painful moments.Vash is a unique anime male in the fact that he IS a bit of a goof and he's also sensitive. Vash cries more than any other male anime character I remember watching, yet he still comes out strong. He's got a big heart and seems to feel everyone elses' pain personally.If you want art for art's sake, don't bother, Trigun isn't a masterpiece of anime in that sense.

And if you're still not convinced, his supporting cast and adversaries are simply... cool. From the obviously Desperado-inspired, cross-carrying partner, Nicholas Wolfwood to the colorful yet vicious Gung-Ho Guns led by the sinister Legato Bluesummers (Gotta love that name), there's nothing boring about Vash The Stampede and his adventures in Planet Gunsmoke.I could've wished for more extras in this set like character bios for every character, especially the Gung Ho Guns and an English commentary from Takahiro Yoshimatsu or maybe a preview of another Yoshimatsu creation, Gungrave.

The art style is great, the music is great, a lot of the characters are great, most fight scenes are pretty great - but here's the problem: the main character and inconsistent tone.Trigun is an anime that doesn't seem to know what it wants to be half the time. Other anime have rapid switches from serious to jokey, but they usually know when it's time to just be serious or awesome; Trigun does not. In the middle of a serious scene, the main character, Vash, will suddenly freak out and run around in terror, while the other characters roll their eyes. This happens without fail, and it ruins many of its own moments by not respecting the tone it had set up. In some places it works, but in others the balance is completely off and it feels more schizophrenic than anything.The overall story is very patchwork; individual, smaller storylines are often uninteresting or entirely random, but the history of the main character and the world in general are far more interesting and engaging. I found the story ultimately unsatisfying, but only because of the inconsistent tone.Throughout Trigun I was constantly alternating between excited and irritated, and in the end irritation won out and left me with a negative view of the series as a whole. Obviously many people feel differently, so don't take my opinion as gospel. Trigun is absolutely worth a shot, but try before you buy - hopefully you'll be like one of its many fans and discover something you can love, but there's always the chance you'll be like me - disappointed at something you -could- have loved being consistently ruined by out-of-place tonal shifts.",3,A bit annoying,1350172800,"10 14, 2012",2012,2002,"['have', 'feeling', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'hate', 'review', 'anime', 'reputation', ""'d"", 'like', 'remind', 'everyone', 'opinion', 'love', 'Trigun', 'favorite', 'anime', 'time', 'not', 'wrong', 'just', 'different', 'things', 'do.Now', ""'ve"", 'got', 'flame', 'shield', 'up', ""'ll"", 'say', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'Trigun', 'first', 'glance', 'art', 'style', 'great', 'music', 'great', 'lot', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'most', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'great', 'here', 'problem', 'main', 'character', 'inconsistent', 'tone.Trigun', 'anime', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'what', 'be', 'time', 'Other', 'anime', 'have', 'rapid', 'switches', 'serious', 'jokey', 'usually', 'know', 'when', 'time', 'just', 'be', 'serious', 'awesome', 'Trigun', 'not', 'middle', 'serious', 'scene', 'main', 'character', 'Vash', 'will', 'suddenly', 'freak', 'out', 'run', 'around', 'terror', 'other', 'characters', 'roll', 'eyes', 'fail', 'many', 'own', 'moments', 'not', 'respecting', 'tone', 'had', 'set', 'up', 'places', 'others', 'balance', 'completely', 'more', 'schizophrenic', 'anything.The', 'overall', 'story', 'very', 'patchwork', 'individual', 'smaller', 'storylines', 'are', 'often', 'uninteresting', 'entirely', 'random', 'history', 'main', 'character', 'world', 'general', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'engaging', 'found', 'story', 'ultimately', 'unsatisfying', 'only', 'inconsistent', 'Trigun', 'was', 'constantly', 'alternating', 'excited', 'irritated', 'end', 'irritation', 'won', 'out', 'left', 'negative', 'view', 'series', 'whole', 'Obviously', 'many', 'people', 'feel', 'differently', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'opinion', 'gospel', 'Trigun', 'absolutely', 'worth', 'shot', 'try', 'buy', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'be', 'one', 'many', 'fans', 'discover', 'something', 'can', 'love', 'always', 'chance', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'something', '-could-', 'have', 'loved', 'being', 'consistently', 'ruined', 'out-of-place', 'tonal', 'shifts']",N/A
673146,ASQ27BAFRNQ2I,B00005OW09,Jamar,"[1, 31]",I think the main reason i probably like trigun is because of the preist. I think i relate to him most of all and that is why i like tri-gun but what makes me hate tri-gun is that the vash (main character) acts way to stupid . When i saw the episode where a boy or whatever was some kind of demon and was ready to blow the vash's head right off his shoulders along with the girl vash was trying to talk the demon kid out of it and the demon kid wasn't even budging and looked like he was going to kill both vash and the girl then the preist shoots the demon kid before anything can happen and vash becomes pissed off at the preist for what he did because he said he should have givin the demon kid a chance and he wouldn't have shot.  Later on down the line the preist starts to believe vash and i think starts to feel bad about what he did so later on when the preist defeats his teacher he decides to turn his back on him and giving him a secound chance while the teacher still has a weapon in his hand and then the preist get's shot in the back and dies for listening to vash's stupid way of thinking. Vash has got to be the dumbest hero besides goku who constantly gives his enemies a secound chance to kill him. If you watch DBZ you will remember when Goku gave Captin Genu a secound chance to walk away and then captin genu realising how stupid Goku was took advantage of Goku's weakness took his body. Lucky for goku he got his body back later on.

He told Goku how evil freiza was and how many people he killed and how he killed both Vegeta's and Goku's dad and then Goku said he would not give freiza a secound chance and promised he would finish freiza off but to no avail Goku gave freiza a secound chance after freiza was cut in half by giving him some of his own power so he could escape the planet that was about to blow up and then freiza used that last bit of power to try and kill goku but then goku turned around and killed freiza just in the nik of time.

I've always thought about picking it up on DVD but have found most anime sets are charging $80 or more for an entire series. While this boxed set is cheaper than most and includes every episode it's lack of extras will put off people who're looking for collector's editions.Trigun is based off the manga series by Yasuhiro Nightow taking place in a sort of western/sci-fi universe (sort of Mad Max meets Firefly). Vash the Stampede is a light-hearted, somewhat aloof marksmen who has a $60,000,000,000 price on his head. Trouble seems to follow him everywhere and not only because of his bounty. Despite his gun-skills, Vash is a pacifist and tries to get out of situations in the most non-violent manner he can. Through his adventures Vash meets Meryl and Milly, insurance agents investigating claims against Vash and the destruction he causes. They also meet up with Wolfwood, a priest with gun-skills equal to Vash's own. While on the surface these characters seem like typical anime-types, each one carries a certain emotional weight with them and we learn more and more about each of them as the series progresses. This somber tone flows through each episode (even the more wacky ones) and really sets this show apart from most other anime's out there.If there was any flaw with this series it probably comes from the abrupt shift in pacing in the later episodes. The first episodes play out like we're following one long road-trip and one big story-arch. Later the episodes shift with flashbacks and jump-forwards and they start to lose their continuity. You will still able to figure out what's going on but for me this was sort of jarring to the experience (especially trying to watch all the episodes in one sitting).Like I said before, this boxed set of Trigun has little extras so if you already own the series there is no reason to pick up this package. There are four discs with all 26 episodes meaning there are six or seven episodes crammed onto one disc at a time. This leaves little room for extras and the video quality might not be up to standard (it looked fine and cleaned up on my 20"" tube television but I can't vouch for anything bigger).If you don't own the series already and are like me and just looking for all the episodes (without spending too much $$$) then this Trigun Boxed set is perfect for you. Even if you're just an anime or sci-fi adventure fan looking for a fun show with a refreshing twist I'd recommend giving this set a shot. It's got likeable chracters, fun action scenes, and mixes humor with seriousness without too much of either.

Cowboy Bebop fans should drop it in the first episode.  I, being a true otaku-psycho, watched the entire series.  I can't believe the number of people who correlate these two anime together.  In my mind when I think of CB I think of insta-classics like Akira or Vampire Hunter D.  When I think of Trigun I think it needs to be after Pokemon on the WB (and definately not adult enough to be part of adult swim).  Seriously, this series is lame.For starters, your HERO, the 60 Billion *Double Dollar* (*Stoopid Unrealistic Warning Phrase*) Man has mood swings from being a total goofball to the hero you expect (trust me, he's the goofball 85% of the time).  His tormented past makes this character even more unbelieveable.  The fact that he doesn't kill anyone is well past goofy-it's insane.  Some have argued that ""not killing people is a good message"".  Yes, it is, but it's not good entertainment.  I expect my protagonist to kick ass, not run like a little girl.Things don't get better for supporting cast, either.  The two insurance agents that follow Vash are a typical anime-chick-doofus and the typical anime-chick-cold-fish.  Each carries around 300 lbs of guns for no particular reason.The comedy of the series isn't funny, the music isn't entertaining (and is usually reffered to as ""too loud""), the backgrounds don't catch your eye (often in yellows), the premise of a ""Warrior of Peace"" is downright foolish, and the plot looks like the studio writers were 1000 chimpanzees with typewriters in a small dark room in Japan.Oh, I forgot to mention that the reasoning behind an insurance company existing after the world ends is ludicrus.  Just wanted to point that out to people who didn't spot it instantly.This anime gets one star because the dubbing wasn't bad.  It's too bad the rest of the series blew.My final vote is to plead to you to just buy Cowboy Bebop Bundle and forget Trigun ever existed.  Think about it, only like 2 people (out of 225) thought that series was bad on it's review boards (opposed to the 5 or so here with just 80 reviews), and they bought the wrong set (buy the 6 DVD set, not the 3 DVD import).I wouldn't lie to you.  This series is rubbish.PS-One last thing, the end of the series is EXACTLY what you think it'll be after watching episode 6-7 (somewhere around there).  It has no twists and no interesting changes, unlike Bebop.  Just face it Triguners, Bebop was, is, and always will be better than this series.

Yet, after a certain point I thought this series turned into a formulaic series where the guns just got bigger and the enemies more ruthless as it progressed.It starts out pretty funny. Vash makes a great comedian. He playfully dances as he dodges bullets, and at one point he's even dancing to a walkman. He steals donuts from Millie and * while he's running away from bad guys. He also loves twisting his middle finger around his index finger to make a peace sign, saying that he fights for ""love and peace.""Then the story took an unexpectedly dark turn. The villains became more vengeful and violent, forcing Vash to use more extra guns. Although he doesn't show his ultimate weapon in this box set, it's ridiculously powerful.The series was just too excessively dramatic. I didn't like how violent the series turned out. At one point, so many characters died, and I wondered just how they were going to change the tone of the series. It changed, but I can't help but think that there was just way too much violence for me to fully recommend it.

The protagonist Vash the Stampede is extremely endearing and instantly likeable. On the oustide, he appears to be a goofy clutz who is incapable of doing anything, but when things get serious, he instatntly transforms into a flawless hero. At first, there are only glimpses of the potential Vash has, but later on, his tragic past and true abilities are revealed in full.At first, we are led to believe that Vash is a terrible monster who leaves a wake of destruction in his path wherever he goes. From the beginning, all the viewer sees are allusions to the ""Humanoid Typhoon."" Yet, we learn that Vash refuses to kill fairly early on. Slowly, his past is revealed such as how he lost the one woman he cared for most, had a growing rift with his psychotic brother Knives (the antagonist), and felt pain and alone when there was destruction which he did in fact create, but against his own will and self control (you will see). Vash is often forced to carry on with a heavy heart. He is a true hero in every sense of the word.The first few episodes are very light hearted and watching them in retrospect makes them seem all the more poignant. There is a distinct parallel between Rurouni Kenshin and Vash. Vash refuses to kill others although he has the power to destroy entire cities lying dormant within him. However, one reviewer stated Vash should be more like Kenshin from Samurai X. I question whether this person ever saw the Rurouni Kenshin TV series which took place well after the Samurai X OVA. Just like Vash, Kenshin refused to kill as well. He regretted nearly EVERY action that he took during the OVA time frame and prior to it.That being said, Trigun is not a show that revolves completely around action, although there is a fair bit involved in the show, especially once the ""priest"" Wolfwood comes into play. Instead, the show relies on charm, wit, humor, drama, and most importantly of all, the development of the characters in order to unfold its story. Don't be misled into thinking that Trigun is a mindless action/violence based anime, nothing could be further from the truth. Vash is forced to kill one time in this series and the agony he goes through over that one moment is striking. There are definetly messages which are trying to be sent across throughout this show.The side characters in this show are also nicely developed. There's Meryl and Milly. Meryl and Milly constantly follow Vash, at the urging of their insurance company. They hound him throughout, and vow to monitor every action that he takes. Meryl is clearly the leader of the two, but she completely misunderstands Vash initially. However, as the show goes on, she begins to understand him more and more, and realizes the pain that he has been forced to harbor for so long. Milly is the silly bumbling sidekick who always looks lost and confused. However, she belies a deep sense of intuition and abilities within her which even surprise her. In fact, if she could just realize it for herself, she's just as capable if not more so than Meryl. The pair can grow tiresome at first, but after a while, they become far more solid characters who do little to detract from the plot.This brings me to my favorite side character, the ""priest"" Wolfwood. Wolfwood is an amazing compliment to Vash. He's the man on a mission who can't be stopped. The ""cross"" which Wolfwood carries on his back is actually a weapon that fires powerful, furious, shots. He is the blunt, rebel type, character who defies what everyone around him says and lives only for himself. Or so it seems. Yet, like Vash, Wolfwood has been forced to harbor terrible amounts of pain. He's also the one who saved Vash from himself and brought him back to reality when he became disillusioned. (when Vash becomes ""Erik"") In fact, in my opinion, the saddest moment of all during the show revolved around Wolfwood. Wolfwood was in tears, and the viewer will more often than not nearly be too...The band of  villains in this show were all interesting and fairly unique. I wish their pasts could have been developed more, but that's just a minor gripe. The fan favorite of the villains is Lagato Bluesummers and he is indeed a powerful character. The confrontation between Vash and Lagato is one of the most powerful moments of the show. And of course there is Knives, the evil half if you will of Vash. They are brothers and look similar to each other, but that's about all the similarities that they share.In the end, Trigun was a magnificent ride of 26 episodes. I bought the box set here on amazon over a couple years ago, and it was 180$, so apparently there has been a 30$ reduction in price. All the more reason to buy this box set ^_^. This series has my strongest reccomendation as it is my second favorite series of all time. Trust me when I say I have seen a lot of anime. As Vash would say, it's all about ""love and peace.""

Definitey deserves a 2nd place for me. It's by far one of the greatest Animes, and just plain period one of this worlds best works. And well, after they finished the Series once, they took it off Adult Swim, along with Cowboy Bebop, and so 2 years back, I came on Amazon and bought Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, and since they took Outlaw Star off quite a while before this, I bought that as well, and the Cowboy Bebop Movie. Got it all for only $95 or so, but of course, they were all Imported, besides the Cowboy Bebop Movie, yet, the video, audio, and all else were just like the R1 DVDs, so I was definitely beyond satisfied, getting all that for only that little bit of money, and from there on out, I have been collecting mainly Imports. Now, all you need to do is go and buy this (I suggest Imported, because, I mean... Dang... Look at the cost of the R1 Set). As for my age rating for this Anime, it is: 16+ (Graphic Violence, Profanity, Sexual Situations, and Adult Complex Themes). Even though most of the violence isn't graphic (a bit of it is), there is so much descruction and death throughout the whole Series. So very many people die... Towns get blown to pieces, and much more. And with that said, I say this is a lot more for mature audiences, than young teens, or kids, that is.

673163,A38MNKGL5TK8XL,B00005OW09,"lemonzest ""Jenn""","[18, 22]","TRIGUN is without a doubt one of the most original and spectacular anime series that I have ever seen. After watching all 26 episodes, I can assure you that purchasing the box set is the farthest thing from a waste of money.As many people can tell you, the story centers around Vash the Stampede, a legendary 'outlaw' who leaves a wake of mass destruction in the towns he passes through (though no one ever dies, not a fact to be overlooked). After receiving several hundred claims on &quot;Humanoid Typhoon&quot;-related events, the Berardinelli Insurance Society sends two claims investigators (the no-nonsense Meryl and her ditzy yet insightful partner Milly) to find this Vash and stop him from causing any further damage. After searching for rumors of this 'terrible' man, they can't believe it when they meet the real thing - instead of a cold-blooded killer, Vash is one of the most hilarious and crazy people on the planet.The first 12 or so episodes of the series are mainly individual-episode stories that focus on humor and character development, with the introduction of such memorable characters as Kuroneko-sama (the mysterious black cat) and Nicholas D. Wolfwood, the traveling priest with the biggest &quot;cross&quot; you've ever seen, and a host of strange villains and ordinary people who cross Vash's path. It's hard to believe it when in later episodes, the humor slowly dies down and Trigun reveals the dark drama that left me in tears for the last few episodes.This series defies a genre - while it is a sci-fi/western story, labels such as &quot;shoujo&quot; (girl's story) or &quot;shounen&quot; (boy's story) simply do not fit - EVERYONE I know loves this show, whether they're teenage girls or middle-aged men. The animation quality is consistently excellent, the music is a perfect fit (especially &quot;H.T.&quot;, the opening theme), and you're guaranteed plenty of laughter (especially when Vash is around pretty women) and tears (episode 23 reduced me to a sobbing mess).Love and peace, and of course donuts for all. ^_-",5,"Any fan of animation, humor, and a great story will love it.",1007683200,"12 7, 2001",2001,2052,"['TRIGUN', 'doubt', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'spectacular', 'anime', 'series', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'watching', '26', 'episodes', 'can', 'assure', 'purchasing', 'box', 'set', 'farthest', 'thing', 'waste', 'money.As', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'tell', 'story', 'centers', 'Vash', 'Stampede', 'legendary', ""'outlaw"", 'who', 'wake', 'mass', 'destruction', 'towns', 'one', 'ever', 'not', 'fact', 'be', 'overlooked', 'receiving', 'several', 'hundred', 'claims', 'quot', 'Humanoid', 'Typhoon', 'quot', '-related', 'events', 'Berardinelli', 'Insurance', 'Society', 'two', 'claims', 'investigators', 'no-nonsense', 'Meryl', 'ditzy', 'yet', 'insightful', 'partner', 'Milly', 'find', 'Vash', 'stop', 'causing', 'further', 'damage', 'searching', 'rumors', ""'terrible"", 'man', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'when', 'meet', 'real', 'thing', 'instead', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'Vash', 'one', 'most', 'hilarious', 'crazy', 'people', 'planet.The', 'first', '12', 'so', 'episodes', 'series', 'are', 'mainly', 'individual-episode', 'stories', 'focus', 'humor', 'character', 'development', 'introduction', 'such', 'memorable', 'characters', 'Kuroneko-sama', 'mysterious', 'black', 'cat', 'Nicholas', 'D.', 'Wolfwood', 'traveling', 'priest', 'biggest', 'quot', 'cross', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'host', 'strange', 'villains', 'ordinary', 'people', 'who', 'cross', 'Vash', 'path', 'hard', 'believe', 'when', 'later', 'episodes', 'humor', 'slowly', 'down', 'Trigun', 'dark', 'drama', 'left', 'tears', 'last', 'few', 'episodes.This', 'series', 'genre', 'sci-fi/western', 'story', 'labels', 'such', 'quot', 'quot', 'girl', 'story', 'quot', 'quot', 'boy', 'story', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'fit', 'EVERYONE', 'know', 'show', ""'re"", 'teenage', 'girls', 'middle-aged', 'men', 'animation', 'quality', 'consistently', 'excellent', 'music', 'perfect', 'fit', 'especially', 'quot', 'H.T.', 'quot', 'opening', 'theme', ""'re"", 'guaranteed', 'plenty', 'laughter', 'especially', 'when', 'Vash', 'pretty', 'women', 'tears', 'episode', '23', 'reduced', 'sobbing', 'mess', '.Love', 'peace', 'course', 'donuts', '^_-']",N/A

Vash the Stampede is the name he is known by but you can call him the 60 billion dollar man. Vash fights to defeat his brother Knives who is determined to rid the world of humans. Knives sees humans as inferior beings whom have no real purpose. Vash faces a gang of fighters on his journey through town after town trying to get closer to his destiny (that is, defeating Knives). The name that these fighters go by is The Gunho-Guns. That's a pretty cool name and the fighters are pretty cool themselves. Of course there's a twist in the plot when one of the Gunho-Guns turns out to be__ Well you'll just have to watch Trigun to find that out. There are plenty more suspenseful twists as the series goes on.Look out for the coolest minister that you'll ever see (excluding The Preacher from a popular comic book)in any animation. The minister in black aka Nicholas Wolfwood. This guy has guns, a cross, and a million dollar smile! The fire power that this guy packs is unbelievable!

Since I was introduced to Cowboy Bebop a little over a year ago, I've seen many different Anime, and I have to say flat out that Trigun is my favorite.  Ironic, considering that Vash the Stampede is the epitome of everything I couldn't stand about Anime before I became a fan, but I actually find Vash to be completely hysterical, and one my favorite anime characters.Its Wild West meets futuristic Sci-Fi in this anime about a man with names like 'The Humanoid Typhoon' and 'The 60 Billion Double Dollar Man'.  Beleived to be the cause of mass destruction wherever he goes, Vash is actually a misunderstood, friendly and peace-loving individual...who is armed to the teeth, with superhuman strength and speed, the sharpest eye on the planet, and a 60 Billion Double Dollar bounty on his head that many are just itching to get their hands on.  He hates violence and won't bring himself to kill anyone...and he has his reasons.The overall plot of the show is great, but only loosely follows the Manga, since the anime is very different towards the end.  Every episode is a continuation in the overall story.  The first few episodes are mostly comical, but as the series progresses, Vash's true enemies reveal themselves and the show begins taking a darker tone.  Many revelations about Vash's mysterious origins are revealed, and at about the middle of the show there is an origin episode that explains it a bit moe.  That said, this anime is both completely hysterical and filled with great action.  Vash's ridiculous behavior, stupid facial expressions and whining and screaming add a whole dimension to the character.  Half the time when I watched this show, I was laughing.  Sometimes it was so funny I was doubled over and tearing from the comedy aspect.Side characters Meryl and Millie are also good characters...Millie's rather stupid but resourceful personality make her one of the funniest characters on the show (and one of my favorites).  A gun-toting priest priest known as Nicholas D. Wolfwood shows up, inadvertantly forming a friendship and partnership with Vash, which leads to more hysterical situations.  When the main cast of villains begin to get introduced to the show, it really takes off.  Some of these villains, namely Legato Bluesummers (one of my all time favorite anime characters), are among the most sinister and evil characters I've seen yet in Anime.Trigun happens to be my favorite Anime.  The overall series has its fair share of comedy, alot of action, but also alot of emotion, particularly towards the end of the show.  Combined with great character development, excellent animation, and a very good soundtrack, Trigun stands as one of the best anime to come out in recent years.  As the second anime I got into after Bebop, I found it to be very entertaining and easy to get into.  While the manga differs a bit from the anime, Trigun is definitely a great show and is worth the watch for any anime fan.  Chances are that if you liked Bebop, you'll like Trigun.",5,Hysterical and action-packed...a great anime series!,1074556800,"01 20, 2004",2004,3096,"['prone', 'whining', 'crying', 'throwing', 'tantrums', 'Vash', 'still', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'was', 'introduced', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'little', 'over', 'year', 'ago', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'different', 'Anime', 'have', 'say', 'flat', 'out', 'Trigun', 'favorite', 'Ironic', 'considering', 'Vash', 'Stampede', 'epitome', 'everything', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Anime', 'became', 'fan', 'actually', 'find', 'Vash', 'be', 'completely', 'hysterical', 'one', 'favorite', 'anime', 'characters.Its', 'Wild', 'West', 'futuristic', 'Sci-Fi', 'anime', 'man', 'names', ""'The"", 'Humanoid', 'Typhoon', '60', 'Billion', 'Double', 'Dollar', 'Man', 'Beleived', 'be', 'cause', 'mass', 'destruction', 'Vash', 'actually', 'misunderstood', 'friendly', 'peace-loving', 'individual', 'who', 'armed', 'teeth', 'superhuman', 'strength', 'speed', 'sharpest', 'eye', 'planet', '60', 'Billion', 'Double', 'Dollar', 'bounty', 'head', 'many', 'are', 'just', 'itching', 'get', 'hands', 'violence', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bring', 'kill', 'anyone', 'reasons.The', 'overall', 'plot', 'show', 'great', 'only', 'loosely', 'Manga', 'anime', 'very', 'different', 'end', 'episode', 'continuation', 'overall', 'story', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'mostly', 'comical', 'series', 'Vash', 'true', 'enemies', 'reveal', 'show', 'taking', 'darker', 'tone', 'Many', 'revelations', 'Vash', 'mysterious', 'origins', 'are', 'revealed', 'middle', 'show', 'origin', 'episode', 'bit', 'moe', 'said', 'anime', 'completely', 'hysterical', 'filled', 'great', 'action', 'Vash', 'ridiculous', 'behavior', 'stupid', 'facial', 'expressions', 'whining', 'screaming', 'add', 'whole', 'dimension', 'character', 'time', 'when', 'watched', 'show', 'was', 'laughing', 'was', 'so', 'funny', 'was', 'doubled', 'tearing', 'comedy', 'characters', 'Meryl', 'Millie', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'characters', 'Millie', 'rather', 'stupid', 'resourceful', 'personality', 'make', 'one', 'funniest', 'characters', 'show', 'one', 'favorites', 'gun-toting', 'priest', 'priest', 'known', 'Nicholas', 'D.', 'Wolfwood', 'up', 'inadvertantly', 'forming', 'friendship', 'partnership', 'Vash', 'more', 'hysterical', 'situations', 'When', 'main', 'cast', 'villains', 'begin', 'get', 'introduced', 'show', 'really', 'off', 'villains', 'namely', 'Legato', 'Bluesummers', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'anime', 'characters', 'are', 'most', 'sinister', 'evil', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'yet', 'Anime.Trigun', 'be', 'favorite', 'Anime', 'overall', 'series', 'fair', 'share', 'comedy', 'alot', 'action', 'also', 'alot', 'emotion', 'particularly', 'end', 'show', 'Combined', 'great', 'character', 'development', 'excellent', 'animation', 'very', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'Trigun', 'one', 'best', 'anime', 'come', 'out', 'recent', 'years', 'second', 'anime', 'got', 'Bebop', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'easy', 'get', 'manga', 'bit', 'anime', 'Trigun', 'definitely', 'great', 'show', 'worth', 'watch', 'anime', 'fan', 'Chances', 'are', 'liked', 'Bebop', ""'ll"", 'like', 'Trigun']",N/A

The first thought I thought was you can't be series this guy can't be this lame it isn't even funny how wierd this guy acts. However it get better when it has added teh charectors. The plot is mediem a mysterious guy bent on making piece without killing any one and trying to help as many people as possible. He come in conflict with his brother who is the opposite and test him with trial and trivalations. A part of it doesn't make sense he has this girl follow him around and is a insurence lady that is suppose to stop him from causing destruction. To save her business money. I think that was more stupid if anything, but with anime you have to be open minded to other peoples visions of there world so out of respect I tryed to understand it. The ending was horrible it seems like they rushed through more of the ending even though they tryed to make the last fight suspesful and they did I FELT THE WHOLE END in general could have been better. They left it open for another season I THINK, but if not then just as I said it sucked. I got more pissed when they made one of my favorite charectors disapeared. I like the fact how they showed that every one isn't perfect with the prest, but things or just crazy.

673172,A2JNAVE328OLH5,B00005OW09,Mike,"[2, 2]","Trigun is, without a second doubt, one of the best animes ever released. The writing is excellent, the animation is charming, the pacing is top notch, and the conclusion is poignant. In my honest opinion, there are few better animes out there greater for the purpose of exposing somebody to Japanese anime. Probability is that if they don't like Trigun, for whatever reason, then they probably won't enjoy anything else...although this will be difficult, because Trigun is incredibly difficult to dislike, let alone hate.Trigun tells the story of Vash the stampede, a gunman with an absolutely enormous bounty on his head. Vash's reputation as the most famous and deadly gunman in the world is well known, and everywhere he goes trouble always follows. His reputation of completely destroying entire cities and towns has earned him the name &#34;The Humanoid Typhoon&#34;, and he is universally feared and hunted as the world's most notorious outlaw.The only catch is that, in reality, Vash is not at all what his reputation makes him out to be. Vash is actually a bit of a goofball, who really only seems to be interested in eating and flirting with beautiful women. Vash's tendency to hide his dark side with humorous antics masks the truly serious nature of his being, and even though he is a good hearted spaz, there is truly a dangerous side to him as well. Throughout most of the series, Vash is uncharacteristically passive, and we quickly learn that it is often those hunting him down that are the ones responsible for the destruction he seems to leave in his wake. Nevertheless, one must never underestimate Vash...who is actually far more powerful than even his reputation leads people to believe.Vash is an exceptionally well written character, and even though he's really the glue who holds the show together, his companions and enemies are just as interesting as he is. Vash quickly makes friends with a couple of girls from an insurance agency hired to follow Vash and record his activities, and he later also befriends a no-nonsense priest-slash-gunman. Another great element to Trigun is Vash's rogue's gallery...a long list of villains who range from psychopathic murdering machines to more sympathetic foes. I'd say that all these characters make the show notable for having side characters who are just as memorable as Vash himself.The complete series of Trigun ran alongside Cowboy Bebop on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim entertainment block for a long time, and for many Americans it was this, as well as Toonami, that introduced us to anime. If you're even casually interested in anime, you owe yourself to watch this, and this collection is just fine.The english dub is actually pretty good, fortunately. Lots of animes botch their translations into english, but that's not really the case here.",5,"Trigun is one of the most excellent animes ever, and a highly recommended series for introducing someone to Japanese animation.",1385078400,"11 22, 2013",2013,2816,"['Trigun', 'second', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'animes', 'ever', 'released', 'writing', 'excellent', 'animation', 'charming', 'pacing', 'top', 'notch', 'conclusion', 'poignant', 'honest', 'opinion', 'are', 'few', 'better', 'animes', 'out', 'there', 'greater', 'purpose', 'exposing', 'somebody', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'Probability', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Trigun', 'reason', 'then', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'anything', 'else', 'will', 'be', 'difficult', 'Trigun', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'dislike', 'let', 'alone', 'hate.Trigun', 'story', 'Vash', 'stampede', 'gunman', 'absolutely', 'enormous', 'bounty', 'head', 'Vash', 'reputation', 'most', 'famous', 'deadly', 'gunman', 'world', 'well', 'known', 'everywhere', 'trouble', 'always', 'reputation', 'completely', 'destroying', 'entire', 'cities', 'towns', 'earned', 'name', '34', 'Humanoid', 'Typhoon', '34', 'universally', 'feared', 'hunted', 'world', 'most', 'notorious', 'outlaw.The', 'only', 'catch', 'reality', 'Vash', 'not', 'what', 'reputation', 'out', 'be', 'Vash', 'actually', 'bit', 'goofball', 'who', 'really', 'only', 'be', 'interested', 'eating', 'flirting', 'beautiful', 'women', 'Vash', 'tendency', 'hide', 'dark', 'side', 'humorous', 'antics', 'masks', 'truly', 'serious', 'nature', 'being', 'even', 'good', 'hearted', 'spaz', 'truly', 'dangerous', 'side', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'series', 'Vash', 'uncharacteristically', 'passive', 'quickly', 'learn', 'often', 'hunting', 'down', 'are', 'ones', 'responsible', 'destruction', 'leave', 'wake', 'Nevertheless', 'one', 'must', 'never', 'underestimate', 'Vash', 'who', 'actually', 'far', 'more', 'powerful', 'even', 'reputation', 'people', 'believe.Vash', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'written', 'character', 'even', 'really', 'glue', 'who', 'show', 'together', 'companions', 'enemies', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'interesting', 'Vash', 'quickly', 'friends', 'couple', 'girls', 'insurance', 'agency', 'hired', 'follow', 'Vash', 'record', 'activities', 'later', 'also', 'no-nonsense', 'priest-slash-gunman', 'great', 'element', 'Trigun', 'Vash', 'rogue', 'gallery', 'long', 'list', 'villains', 'who', 'range', 'psychopathic', 'murdering', 'machines', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'foes', ""'d"", 'say', 'characters', 'make', 'show', 'notable', 'having', 'side', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'memorable', 'Vash', 'himself.The', 'complete', 'series', 'Trigun', 'ran', 'alongside', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'entertainment', 'block', 'long', 'time', 'many', 'Americans', 'was', 'as', 'well', 'Toonami', 'introduced', 'anime', ""'re"", 'even', 'casually', 'interested', 'anime', 'owe', 'watch', 'collection', 'just', 'fine.The', 'english', 'dub', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'fortunately', 'Lots', 'animes', 'botch', 'translations', 'english', 'not', 'really', 'case', 'here']",N/A

I definitely enjoyed this anime quite much, even if it's in standard definition.The story follows Vash the Stampede and his travels around the Wild West looking world. He is named the ""Human typhoon"" and you will find out during the anime why he is called this. The story is really superb and you find out about Vash's life and more about the area he lives on. I really didn't see the twists that came along and I really enjoyed the surprises.The animation is very old school, but it's not bad by any means. It's not widescreen as well, but since it was made in the 90's it looks very nice. It defiantly has that 90's anime character drawings, and the emotions they portray. The unique look of some cities is really well made since you have so many different locations they visit and some of the things they find need to be portrayed well to care about them.The characters have a really unique look to them and you can definitely tell the fighting style they have just by looking at them. One of the main baddies actually looks like Ovan (.hack) to me and I really thought that was awesome they took a bit of his look from this anime.The soundtrack reminds me a lot of Coyboy Bebop which is never a bad thing. Not all of the themes remind me of Coyboy Bebop though and they still keep that western feel to them and they just fit into the anime really well.The anime is over 20 episodes long and I felt that it had a good length to the series and I didn't really find any of the episodes to be filler. They do have one episode that is halfway recap, but its still worth watching due to what they day during the actual episode.

In fact, he's pretty much...a dork. He never fires a shot until the fifth episode, he always runs away from battle, he never kills anyone, he doesn't like the sight of blood, and seems to be always getting himself in some kind of trouble. All of which makes Vash the Stampede one of the greatest anime character of all time.""Trigun"" is the third Japanese take on the ""sci-fi western"" in 1998. The first being the enormous ""Cowboy Bebop,"" and the second being ""Outlaw Star."" Only difference with them and ""Trigun"" is that ""Trigun"" tends to be more western than the other two. The world is basically a ""western Tatooine"" with five moons, no aliens, and a [lot] of bandits, thugs, asassins and whatevers.Although, at times the story can get a bit too ""cliched,"" (it happens so few that it's hardly noticeable) the heart of ""Trigun"" lies within the characters. The comical and oft-harrassed insurance ladies Meryl and Milly, the gun-toting life-loving priest Nicholas Wolfwood, the impressively scary Legato Bluesummers, the multi-interesting set of side-characters (especially the Gung-Ho Guns) and of course Vash. A man who's past lays shrouded in mystery, with a heart of gold, yet is still labeled as the most dangerous gunman ever.I cannot get too far into this otherwise I will end up spoiling this anime-classic, but take my word for it.

Yet as it continues shows itself to be unique for its main characters.  Vash is not some self rightous gunman, cold and unyielding.  He has more in common with Shinji Akari (Neon Genesis) then with Spike Spiegal (Cowboy Bebop).  Taught from childhood that noone has the right too take the life of another, vash has tried too honor his surrogate mothers words.  Fearing too kill and Feeling remorse when even his enemies die.  Vash's comic goofiness, gluttonous love for doughnuts, and exuberant flirtation for a pretty face (even if that woman so happens too be pointing a gun at him at the time) is merely a mask for his tortured soul within.  An alien, with great powers, long life, and intellegence; he and his twin brother knives have always disagreed on a simple matter since children.  over the years, thier differances have engulffed a world, and brought many innocents into thier feud.A striking anime, very different from many that has come before it.  Vash's melancholy and remorse about people dying, is deep and heartfelt.  And the characters around him help too make this story, a worth while one. with adequette animation by todays standards.

673183,AO3P5BXFCXFHD,B00005OW09,Pandra Selivanov,"[3, 3]","Warning: Contains spoilersI recently read a review of Trigun by a Christian lady who wrote that the protagonist, Vash the Stampede, reminded her of Jesus Christ. I understand this. Trigun is an anime series and might be dismissed by people who think it's ""just a cartoon."" There's no denying that Vash is a goofy guy, obsessed with donuts and prone to acting like a lovesick teenager whenever he sees a pretty girl. The first few episodes are silly beyond belief-or are they?The series is only 26 episodes, and as it progresses, it quickly becomes evident that the way Vash acts is just that-an act. He has an almost unbearably tragic past and it has left him with a firm determination never to kill and an overwhelming desire to protect the innocent. His idiotic grin is conciously used to hide behind-a fact that characters comment on from time to time. His true self is much more serious.Trigun poses the tough questions. Vash wants more than anything to save people. He wants everyone to live together in peace and happiness. He suffers for his convictions, his body terribly scarred, his soul oppressed with grief and pain as he is forced to come to the realization that it is not always possible to protect an innocent person without taking the life of a guilty person. His anguish when he is forced to kill one villain to save two helpless women is overwhelming.It begs the question-how far does one take pacifism? Is it even possible to be a pacifist in this imperfect world? How does one reconcile a belief in the sacredness of life with the pure evil that some people spread through their lives, and how does one stop an evil person without killing them? Is mercy to the guilty injustice to the innocent? These are the questions Vash wrestles with and there are no easy answers, nor does Trigun provide a happy ending. In fact, the finale is rather troubling, with Vash once again attempting what seems an impossible task-the redemption of his brother, a merciless killer, yet a man he loves and is not willing to give up on.Trigun is not a show for children, although Vash is one of the most visually striking characters in anime and there's a lot of exciting action. There's also a lot of death, including the death of children, one of whom is shot when he is about to kill Vash. It's an intellectually demanding show that takes the viewer, not to some grey area between good and evil, but right up to the razor's edge in the middle of the grey area, where morals and values cease to be words and become worth dying for and one step over the line becomes a burden that can never be lifted.There is a heavy Christian influence in Trigun. Aside from Vash's mantra ""Thou shalt not kill"" there is the priest, Wolfwood, who not only kills but bitterly quarrels with Vash over the necessity of killing. He's seen Vash's scars, mental and physical, and he doesn't believe in the ideals that Vash tries to live up to. Yet in the end, he comes around to Vash's point of view. In fact, there are a number of people, good and bad and indifferent, whose lives are turned around by Vash. His willingness to suffer so that others may be spared has an extraordinary effect on those he comes into contact with. However, Trigun doesn't pull any punches. Vash's desire to keep his own hands clean sometimes leads to terrible consequences. He's not all-powerful and sometimes his pacifism costs more lives than it saves. Yet somehow he never loses faith that he can find the answer to the impossible questions his pacifism raises. When he is finally forced to kill, he is sure that he could have found an alternative that would have allowed everyone to live. And he agonizes more over the death of one murderous criminal than that criminal did over the deaths of hundreds of innocent people.In the end, Vash seems to find some balance in his life, an awareness that it is not always possible to save everyone. At the same time, he does not lose his faith in the belief that everyone is worthy of being saved, nor does he lose his hope that if he tries hard enough, he can find the answers to the tough questions. Trigun rewards rewatching, the early silliness having an almost unbearable poignancy as the viewer remembers all the pain and sorrow Vash is hiding with his buffoon act. It's impossible to view this show in a thoughtful manner without pondering the problems Vash is facing, and trying to find some answers for oneself. And the lady who found Vash reminding her of Jesus Christ? I understand. While Vash isn't Christ, he is an example of how a person can find redemption in following the ideals of Jesus. Perhaps ""Thou shalt not kill"" is an impossible standard, especially in life and death situations, and perhaps it is foolish to believe that everyone can be saved. It's still good to watch something like Trigun, a story that advances the thought that impossible standards are worth trying to live up to.",5,Of Ethics and Anime,1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,4912,"['Warning', 'Contains', 'spoilersI', 'recently', 'read', 'review', 'Trigun', 'Christian', 'lady', 'who', 'wrote', 'protagonist', 'Vash', 'Stampede', 'reminded', 'her', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'understand', 'Trigun', 'anime', 'series', 'might', 'be', 'dismissed', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'just', 'cartoon', 'denying', 'Vash', 'goofy', 'guy', 'obsessed', 'donuts', 'prone', 'acting', 'lovesick', 'teenager', 'whenever', 'pretty', 'girl', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'silly', 'belief-or', 'are', 'series', 'only', '26', 'episodes', 'quickly', 'evident', 'way', 'Vash', 'just', 'that-an', 'act', 'almost', 'unbearably', 'tragic', 'past', 'left', 'firm', 'determination', 'never', 'kill', 'overwhelming', 'desire', 'protect', 'innocent', 'idiotic', 'grin', 'conciously', 'used', 'hide', 'behind-a', 'fact', 'characters', 'comment', 'time', 'time', 'true', 'self', 'much', 'more', 'serious.Trigun', 'tough', 'questions', 'Vash', 'more', 'anything', 'save', 'people', 'everyone', 'live', 'together', 'peace', 'happiness', 'convictions', 'body', 'terribly', 'scarred', 'soul', 'oppressed', 'grief', 'pain', 'forced', 'come', 'realization', 'not', 'always', 'possible', 'protect', 'innocent', 'person', 'taking', 'life', 'guilty', 'person', 'anguish', 'when', 'forced', 'kill', 'one', 'villain', 'save', 'two', 'helpless', 'women', 'overwhelming.It', 'question-how', 'far', 'one', 'take', 'pacifism', 'even', 'possible', 'be', 'pacifist', 'imperfect', 'world', 'How', 'one', 'reconcile', 'belief', 'sacredness', 'life', 'pure', 'people', 'spread', 'lives', 'how', 'one', 'stop', 'evil', 'person', 'killing', 'mercy', 'guilty', 'injustice', 'innocent', 'are', 'questions', 'Vash', 'wrestles', 'are', 'easy', 'answers', 'Trigun', 'provide', 'happy', 'ending', 'fact', 'finale', 'rather', 'troubling', 'Vash', 'once', 'again', 'attempting', 'what', 'impossible', 'task-the', 'redemption', 'brother', 'merciless', 'killer', 'man', 'not', 'willing', 'give', 'up', 'on.Trigun', 'not', 'show', 'children', 'Vash', 'one', 'most', 'visually', 'striking', 'characters', 'anime', 'lot', 'exciting', 'action', 'also', 'lot', 'death', 'including', 'death', 'children', 'one', 'whom', 'shot', 'when', 'kill', 'Vash', 'intellectually', 'demanding', 'show', 'viewer', 'not', 'grey', 'area', 'good', 'evil', 'right', 'up', 'razor', 'edge', 'middle', 'grey', 'area', 'where', 'morals', 'values', 'cease', 'be', 'words', 'become', 'worth', 'dying', 'one', 'step', 'line', 'burden', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'lifted.There', 'heavy', 'Christian', 'influence', 'Trigun', 'Aside', 'Vash', 'mantra', 'Thou', 'shalt', 'not', 'kill', 'priest', 'Wolfwood', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'bitterly', 'quarrels', 'Vash', 'necessity', 'killing', 'seen', 'Vash', 'scars', 'mental', 'physical', ""n't"", 'believe', 'ideals', 'Vash', 'live', 'up', 'end', 'around', 'Vash', 'point', 'view', 'fact', 'are', 'number', 'people', 'good', 'bad', 'indifferent', 'lives', 'are', 'turned', 'Vash', 'willingness', 'suffer', 'so', 'others', 'may', 'be', 'spared', 'extraordinary', 'effect', 'contact', 'However', 'Trigun', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'Vash', 'desire', 'keep', 'own', 'hands', 'clean', 'sometimes', 'terrible', 'consequences', 'not', 'all-powerful', 'pacifism', 'more', 'lives', 'somehow', 'never', 'faith', 'can', 'find', 'answer', 'impossible', 'questions', 'pacifism', 'When', 'finally', 'forced', 'kill', 'sure', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'alternative', 'would', 'have', 'allowed', 'everyone', 'live', 'more', 'death', 'one', 'murderous', 'criminal', 'criminal', 'did', 'deaths', 'hundreds', 'innocent', 'end', 'Vash', 'find', 'balance', 'life', 'awareness', 'not', 'always', 'possible', 'save', 'everyone', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'lose', 'faith', 'belief', 'everyone', 'worthy', 'being', 'saved', 'lose', 'hope', 'hard', 'enough', 'can', 'find', 'answers', 'tough', 'questions', 'Trigun', 'rewards', 'rewatching', 'early', 'silliness', 'having', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'poignancy', 'viewer', 'pain', 'sorrow', 'Vash', 'hiding', 'buffoon', 'act', 'impossible', 'view', 'show', 'thoughtful', 'manner', 'pondering', 'problems', 'Vash', 'facing', 'trying', 'find', 'answers', 'oneself', 'lady', 'who', 'found', 'Vash', 'reminding', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'understand', 'Vash', ""n't"", 'Christ', 'example', 'how', 'person', 'can', 'find', 'redemption', 'following', 'ideals', 'Jesus', 'Perhaps', 'Thou', 'shalt', 'not', 'kill', 'impossible', 'standard', 'especially', 'life', 'death', 'situations', 'perhaps', 'foolish', 'believe', 'everyone', 'can', 'be', 'saved', 'still', 'good', 'watch', 'something', 'Trigun', 'story', 'thought', 'impossible', 'standards', 'are', 'worth', 'trying', 'live', 'up']",N/A

Johnny Yong Bosch does an awesome job as Vash, and all of the rest of the cast does a good job as well.Trigun is one of my favorite anime series, one I recommend to just about anyone, be they anime fans or not! This release looks good too - with 26 episodes on 4 discs, it doesn't take up too much shelf space. I don't know what the video and audio quality will be like, but it is bound to be better than my imported Hong Kong set!***UPDATE 10/15/10***It has been pointed out that on Amazon's image of this product, it says that it is 24 episodes on 4 DVDs. According to AnimeNewsNetwork's enciclopedia, Trigun is 26 episodes. My imported set says it has 26 episodes. So I can only hope that it is a misprint or something with this set. Or maybe they cut the recap episodes or moved them to Extras. I guess we won't really know until the end of October.***UPDATE 10/26/10***Good news - all 26 episodes are included!

The series animation while about ten years back may not be up to date with some of the newer anime fans liking but I say give the series a shot those disbelievers maybe surprised at how enjoyable the series truly is to them.  The series voice cast both the subbed and dubbed fit their character roles perfectly and being a fan of a few of the dubbed voice cast I'm relieved that Funimation didn't re-dub the series though with some other Geneon titles that they've gotten to release and will release some of those could be and probably should be re-dubbed.  The extras like with most recent anime box sets isn't much just the usual trailers and textless intro/ending songs but hey for $20.00 dollars something I'm willing to overlook,  so if you've gotten series like Cowboy Bebop or Outlaw Star and even if you haven't here's another great series to add to your anime library....",5,A Nice Edition For Fans Looking For Good Series That Were Hard To Get,1292457600,"12 16, 2010",2010,1179,"['Seeing', 'series', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'regretted', 'not', 'getting', 'series', 'box', 'set', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'ridiculous', 'prices', 'people', 'wanted', 'box', 'set', '300.00', 'dollars', 'almost', 'gave', 'up', 'hope', 'now', 'beloved', 'Funimation', 're-released', 'series', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'happier', 'series', 'animation', 'about', 'ten', 'years', 'back', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'up', 'date', 'newer', 'anime', 'fans', 'liking', 'say', 'give', 'series', 'shot', 'disbelievers', 'maybe', 'surprised', 'how', 'enjoyable', 'series', 'truly', 'series', 'voice', 'cast', 'subbed', 'dubbed', 'fit', 'character', 'roles', 'perfectly', 'being', 'fan', 'few', 'dubbed', 'voice', 'cast', ""'m"", 'relieved', 'Funimation', 'did', ""n't"", 're-dub', 'series', 'other', 'Geneon', 'titles', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'release', 'will', 'release', 'could', 'be', 'probably', 'should', 'be', 're-dubbed', 'extras', 'most', 'recent', 'anime', 'box', 'sets', ""n't"", 'much', 'just', 'usual', 'trailers', 'textless', 'intro/ending', 'songs', 'hey', '20.00', 'dollars', 'something', ""'m"", 'willing', 'overlook', 'so', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'series', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'Outlaw', 'Star', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", 'here', 'great', 'series', 'add', 'anime', 'library']",N/A

Oliver,"[4, 16]","I read reviews on this for a while, then I finally cought it on adult swim, but I didn't start on the first episode, the series started off ok, the comedy was ok, and it has loads of action, but there's the big problem I just can't get over, the main character himself, Vash the Stampede.  For someone who causes chaos everywhere he goes,(which he does) he doesn't want to kill anyone, nor wants anyone dead(escpecially civilians, which I respect from a main character)!!  But when someone is even threatning to kill him, trying to kill him, or when one dude anilates a whole city, he refuses to kill or injure anyone, even a fraking sandworm, and human looking demons.  That's straight out rediculus!!  Just when I was thinking this guy was bad... only to learn that he was more of a soft hearted, kind, peace-lover.  I just can't stand the fact that he ain't the gun-slinger I thought he'd be(He can shoot, but he doesn't waste any bullets on human enemys at all!)  This really made me lose a lot of intrest in the series.  I know a lot of people may dissagree with me, but trying to make a peace loving man bad... just don't mix in my ind.  Even the priest is more dangerous than him, and Vash don't want him to kill anyone.  But knives stays true to the ways of being a vicious villian, which I am glad of.

673201,A158DLPKI1UKSL,B00005OW09,Sierra,"[0, 2]","Trigun is a good anime series, but I would not say it is one of the best of all time.  The story takes place on a desert planet with a western backdrop, and revolves around Vash ""The Stampede,"" a lone gunman with exceptional, inhuman marksmanship.  At first he is seen as childish and a coward, but in later episodes he reveals a deeper, darker more intense side of himself.  He lives by the philosophy that it is not right to kill no matter how much power you possess.  And Vash does have power.  It is this way of thinking that inevitably causes him much pain and suffering thoroughout his life, especially since almost everyone is out to kill or capture Vash for his enormous bounty (60 billion double dollars) or for some other reason.I noticed there are many reviewers who think this series is garbage, particularly since Vash refuses to kill.  To all of you idiots I ask, ""If someone who possessed the kind of power and skill like Vash has spent the entire series slaughtering all his enemies, what would that contribute to the series as a whole?""  The answer is simple.  It would contribute absolutely nothing.  It would make the series hollow, stupid and pointless...just like many of your critiscisms.  I suppose there will always be some people out there who are to dumb to realize the emotional depth of the Trigun series.  These are the same people who bash the Evangelion series as well, and quite frankly, your stupidity makes me sick to my stomach.There are several reasons why I could not give 5-out-of-5 for this series.  For example, even though Vash's character development was fairly good the story failed to answer essential questions such as, ""What is Vash?""  And, ""Where did he learn his incredible shooting skills?""  ""Where did he come from?""  Also, the two supporting female characters Millie and Meryl had almost no character development whatsoever.  This is odd because they are two of the main characters, and yet the viewer knows almost nothing about them except that Millie is...well...kinda dumb and Meryl has about as much warmth as a winter afternoon.  Nicholas Wolfwood is an interesting character.  He is a ""priest"" with surprising skill as a marksman.  He seems to be the only real supporting character in the series, and the only one who actually cares for and understands Vash.All in all, Trigun is good but not great.  The animation is not the best and the music throughout the episodes could be more interesting and varied.  The extras are mediocre with nothing special to offer.

After getting the first DVD entitled The $$60,000,000,000 Man, I was hooked. TRIGUN features some of the strongest characters I have seen in Japanese animation. The stories are individual but build into the entire development of each character and especially the strange hero, Vash the Stampede. I won't ruin it for you by revealing any of the plot. This series is absolutely brilliant, each story is carefully thoughout and contains an enormous amount of humour (sometimes adult in theme) but the hero himself is a beautiful character that is superbly drawn. This hero is a bit like Clint Eastwood's The Man With No Name from the Dollars Spaghetti westerns. He enters towns as a drifter and is the ultimate in cool, but what sets him aside from other heroes is he acts like an idiot and does some really crazy stuff along the way. I love the English dub to this series, one of the finest and carefully put together dubs ever and it is probably even better than the Japanese soundtrack because it is so funny. The producers couldn't have found a better voice actor for the hero. The music to this series is excellent, from spanish guitars to heavy metal guitars, it never ceases to be cool. A superb soundtrack with many interesting instruments and styles sets mood and emotions.This series is the ultimate anime treat, I have started to collect the series on DVD but now I'm just going to get the DVD box set instead.This series works on so many levels and is a highly intelligent, thought provoking series with a high level of comedy.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",5,"TRIGUN's a masterpiece, unique &amp; ultimately brilliant anime",1004400000,"10 30, 2001",2001,1666,"['started', 'get', 'TRIGUN', 'series', 'anime', 'reviews', 'net', 'various', 'other', 'sources', 'recommended', 'getting', 'first', 'DVD', 'entitled', '60,000,000,000', 'Man', 'was', 'hooked', 'TRIGUN', 'strongest', 'characters', 'have', 'seen', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'stories', 'are', 'individual', 'build', 'entire', 'development', 'character', 'especially', 'strange', 'hero', 'Vash', 'Stampede', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'revealing', 'plot', 'series', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'story', 'carefully', 'thoughout', 'enormous', 'amount', 'humour', 'sometimes', 'adult', 'theme', 'hero', 'beautiful', 'character', 'superbly', 'drawn', 'hero', 'bit', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Man', 'No', 'Name', 'Dollars', 'Spaghetti', 'westerns', 'towns', 'drifter', 'ultimate', 'cool', 'what', 'aside', 'other', 'heroes', 'idiot', 'really', 'crazy', 'stuff', 'way', 'love', 'English', 'dub', 'series', 'one', 'finest', 'carefully', 'put', 'together', 'dubs', 'ever', 'probably', 'even', 'better', 'Japanese', 'soundtrack', 'so', 'funny', 'producers', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'found', 'better', 'voice', 'actor', 'hero', 'music', 'series', 'excellent', 'spanish', 'guitars', 'heavy', 'metal', 'guitars', 'never', 'be', 'cool', 'superb', 'soundtrack', 'many', 'interesting', 'instruments', 'styles', 'sets', 'mood', 'emotions.This', 'series', 'ultimate', 'anime', 'treat', 'have', 'started', 'collect', 'series', 'DVD', 'now', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'get', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'instead.This', 'series', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'thought', 'provoking', 'series', 'high', 'level', 'comedy.HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A

It was a bit of ""turn your brain off and go with it"" type fun. Vash the Stampede is the terror of any town he visits. Vash the Stampede is such a terrifying outlaw, he's got a $$60,000,000,000 bounty on his head. Vash the Stampede...is a total dork!When I saw this set at a local store, I had to get it to see the rest of series. I was surprised when a few episodes later, stuff just got serious. It was a bit of a mood whiplash. But it actually works for the series. I can't quite put my finger on how or why, but in spite of how thing turn quite a bit darker throughout the series, Trigun never loses its charm.Trigun easily gets five stars from me on all fronts. Whether you're talking about mindless dorky fun or tragically serious, the story and characters never lose their charm. The animation itself is brilliant. Going from the regular animation to chibi for comedic affect is a convention I've always respected since my days of watching Teen Titans. Trigun pulls it off rather humorously. It also has probably the one opening theme song that I won't skip past, anime or otherwise.If you're looking for a point for getting into anime, you could do much worse than to make this your first anime. Before seeing this, I would also have suggested Escaflowne and Akira for first time anime watchers. Trigun is at least as good as either of those and deserves a watch.If you're already into anime, this deserves to be on your shelf. It's fun. It's serious. It's fast paced.

The unlikely hero has a 60 billion double dollar reward on his head.  He has acquired this enormous reward for actions, once you've met this character, he doesn't even seem capable of doing.  Vash, the hero, is unable to kill anyone or anything; this complicates many of his predicaments (mostly near the end of the series).  Throughout the tale of TRIGUN you meet many characters, good and bad, one of which his brother, Knives.  Among these characters are a priest, WolfWood, and two representatives from an insurance firm, Meryl and Millie, that are told to follow Vash and document all the destruction he happens to cause.  Although in the first half of the series the animation appears to be goofy, the last half is very dramatic, as Vash struggles to live while all this death happening around him, that he seems to cause.The animation in the series is ok, doesn't match up to that of CowBoy Bebop or Vampire Hunter D: BloodLust.

673214,ALB9086PLUOEP,B00005OW09,Winston Jen,"[11, 14]","Trigun is essentially Rurouni Kenshin with guns. I believe that is the best way to describe it. The similarities are quite striking - the hero protects people with weapons, which are, by definition, designed to injure, maim and kill. Also like Kenshin, Trigun mixes action and drama with comedy, although its transition from serious drama to light-hearted comedy works much better than in Kenshin, in my view.However, where Kenshin tells the story of man's triumph over adversity (the worst that happens is Kenshin turning to the Battousai without actually killing anyone, due to luck or other factors), Trigun actually takes that a step further and shows the effect of the guilt on Vash, when he 'crosses the line'. This is shown very well in his confrontation with Legato later on in the series.Trigun has a reputation of having filler episodes throughout its beginning, but if filler is defined as a 'one episode storyline', then the entire series (this applies to other series as well) is simply a 10-hour lump of filler. Episodes that do not advance the primary plot do not bother me, but an excessive amount of them can ruin the experience. More important than advancing the plot is making the viewing experience enjoyable. Ghost in the Shell is an example of where this failed to happen for me.The only real flaw I can find with Trigun is that some of the characters are not as well developed as Vash, Wolfwood, Knives or even Frank Marlon. If we learnt more about Milly, Meryl and some more of the Gung-Ho Guns. Despite this, Trigun is one of the best action-adventure animes around, and is highly recommended for fans of the genre. Even those not into action will find something to like in Trigun.",5,I love it!

673215,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B00005OW09,Zack Davisson,"[0, 0]","""Trigun"" is another one of those anime that I have known about forever, but never got around to watching for some reason.  At almost any manga/anime convention you are guaranteed to see at least one Vash the Stampede walking around with Nicholas D. Wolfwood carrying a giant homemade cross. When Funimation put out this boxset of the Complete Series, I figured it was finally time to sit down and see what all the fuss was about with the guy in the long red coat and his friend with the giant cross.To no ones surprise, ""Trigun"" is a great series.I really love the Space Western genre (Firefly, anyone?) and ""Trigun"" takes the tropes of the genre and gives it some unique twists.  Sure, there are the usual drifting into a barren town and kicking out the local boss, or quick-draw contests and bank robberies, but there are also sentient plants and seedships traveling interstellar distances.Tone-wise, the series is split almost directly in half.  The first part is a screwball comedy of errors, focusing on two insurance agents Meryl and Milly, as they hung for the legendary gunfighter Vash the Stampede, known as the Human Typhoon.  Vash causes enormous amounts of damage every where he goes, and the insurance company is looking to cap their loses.  They fall into company with a goofy, seemingly harmless guy in a long red coat who (of course) turns out to be Vash the Stampede himself.  But instead of a cold, calculating gunman Vash is a pacifist who fights only for Peach and Love and refuses to kill.  They do some road tripping, moving from town to town, and pick up as a straggler the priest Nicholas D. Wolfwood who turns out to be almost as good with a gun as Vash himself.The second half get serious, delving into the past of Vash and Nicholas, and the mysterious killer known only as Knives.  Vash has a history that he has entirely forgotton, including exactly who and what he is.  And it turns out that Nicholas did not join their company by accident, and tragedy moves in his wake.I confess I like the second half better than the first.  The ""super killer who is really a nice guy but just misundertood"" bit works for awhile, but starts to wear thin.  And just when you can't take another comedy of misunderstandings and hijinks, the true story takes over and you delve beneath the surface of the characters.  That was were this anime moved from just mindless fun to something worthwhile and interesting.I am glad I finally got around to watching ""Trigun.""  Great series, and this Funimation boxset is an economical way to get all 26 episodes.  There isn't much here bonus feature-wise, but that isn't really necessary.  The story is complete as it is.",5,Space Cowboy,1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,2671,"['Trigun', 'one', 'have', 'known', 'forever', 'never', 'got', 'watching', 'reason', 'almost', 'manga/anime', 'convention', 'are', 'guaranteed', 'see', 'least', 'one', 'Vash', 'Stampede', 'walking', 'around', 'Nicholas', 'D.', 'Wolfwood', 'carrying', 'giant', 'homemade', 'cross', 'When', 'Funimation', 'put', 'out', 'boxset', 'Complete', 'Series', 'figured', 'was', 'finally', 'time', 'sit', 'down', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'guy', 'long', 'red', 'coat', 'friend', 'giant', 'cross.To', 'ones', 'surprise', 'Trigun', 'great', 'series.I', 'really', 'love', 'Space', 'Western', 'genre', 'Firefly', 'anyone', 'Trigun', 'tropes', 'genre', 'unique', 'twists', 'Sure', 'are', 'usual', 'drifting', 'barren', 'town', 'kicking', 'out', 'local', 'boss', 'quick-draw', 'contests', 'bank', 'robberies', 'are', 'also', 'sentient', 'plants', 'seedships', 'traveling', 'interstellar', 'distances.Tone-wise', 'series', 'split', 'almost', 'directly', 'half', 'first', 'part', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'errors', 'focusing', 'two', 'insurance', 'agents', 'Meryl', 'Milly', 'hung', 'legendary', 'gunfighter', 'Vash', 'Stampede', 'known', 'Human', 'Typhoon', 'Vash', 'enormous', 'amounts', 'damage', 'where', 'insurance', 'company', 'looking', 'cap', 'loses', 'fall', 'company', 'goofy', 'seemingly', 'harmless', 'guy', 'long', 'red', 'coat', 'who', 'course', 'out', 'be', 'Vash', 'Stampede', 'instead', 'cold', 'calculating', 'gunman', 'Vash', 'pacifist', 'who', 'only', 'Peach', 'Love', 'kill', 'do', 'road', 'tripping', 'moving', 'town', 'town', 'pick', 'up', 'straggler', 'priest', 'Nicholas', 'D.', 'Wolfwood', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'almost', 'good', 'gun', 'Vash', 'himself.The', 'second', 'half', 'get', 'serious', 'delving', 'past', 'Vash', 'Nicholas', 'mysterious', 'killer', 'known', 'only', 'Knives', 'Vash', 'history', 'entirely', 'forgotton', 'including', 'exactly', 'who', 'what', 'out', 'Nicholas', 'did', 'not', 'join', 'company', 'accident', 'tragedy', 'moves', 'wake.I', 'confess', 'like', 'second', 'half', 'better', 'first', 'super', 'killer', 'who', 'really', 'nice', 'guy', 'just', 'misundertood', 'bit', 'awhile', 'wear', 'thin', 'just', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'comedy', 'misunderstandings', 'hijinks', 'true', 'story', 'delve', 'surface', 'characters', 'was', 'were', 'anime', 'moved', 'just', 'mindless', 'fun', 'something', 'worthwhile', 'interesting.I', 'am', 'glad', 'finally', 'got', 'watching', 'Trigun', 'Great', 'series', 'Funimation', 'boxset', 'economical', 'way', 'get', '26', 'episodes', ""n't"", 'much', 'here', 'bonus', 'feature-wise', ""n't"", 'really', 'necessary', 'story', 'complete']",N/A
673216,A2VFREBXT6E3G2,B00005OW09,zooey,"[3, 7]","Im writing this review after having just seen the ""Paradise"" episode - and after having just cried for the first time since i can remember at at any story.  There i said it.  Stop laughing.  I dont care.  Haha.Seriously though...wow.  Im just about to finish my junior doctor year and this series has kept me going through the worst  and most degrading year ever for me.  I've filtered each episode slooowly as theyve progressed - watching and re-watching them cos i just dont want to rush something thats been such a revelation to me.I've only ever seen cowboy bebop as a series other than this (seen lots of anime films though) but im still a newbie, i only started last year when i moved in with a hong kong guy in uni halls (ken - i owe you mate wherever you are).  Im in England and the childish scorn i have to smile at when i tell someone im really falling in love with anime/manga is a real anger-maker - especially when their idea of an interesting story is to watch the british soaps that frankly, would make me want to hang myself if i could make it past the depressing title music.  From reading these reviews it seems the american audience has a greater appreciciation of what animation can be, although, seen as though your country is also responsible for buffy, im not gonna jump to conclusions.Anyhoo - what can i say about trigun?  These reviews ive read pretty much cover it.  To those reviewers that cant stand it cos they cant stand vash's pacifism - well, lol, what does that tell you about yourself? hahaha.  And may i just say that I, for one, absolutely ADORE the expressionistic animation that has a character pulling a fantastic face, and sharping from serious to silly in a millysecond.  You either get it or you dont - dont criticise it if you dont - a ""western"" animation would never have the cahunas to try something so overtly experimental, though in japan its probably not so new.Anway, ive realised i havent said anything about the best stuff - i've loved the characters, all of them - vash is truly one of the all time greatest heroes ive encountered, in any from of story telling  - in fact, hes such a ""golden"" hero that im astounded that no other story has used a similar idea for a hero before (not one ive seen anyway lol), and wolfwood, well, im choking up just typing his name so im gonna stop there.I feel like i wish i could tell you so much more but its 2.35 at night and frankly, the only way to do it justice is to watch it.  Words arent sufficient.And i still have to see the last three ones!!! You know when you're approaching the end of a story that you know will stay with you forever and you cant bear that its gonna finish soon...This state of mind is what storytelling can be, at its pinnacle.Love and peace ;)",5,Rest In Peace Wolfwood,1105833600,"01 16, 2005",2005,2763,"['Im', 'writing', 'review', 'having', 'just', 'seen', 'Paradise', 'episode', 'having', 'just', 'cried', 'first', 'time', 'i', 'can', 'remember', 'story', 'i', 'said', 'Stop', 'laughing', 'dont', 'care', 'Haha.Seriously', 'wow', 'Im', 'just', 'finish', 'junior', 'doctor', 'year', 'series', 'kept', 'going', 'worst', 'most', 'degrading', 'year', 'ever', ""'ve"", 'filtered', 'episode', 'slooowly', 'theyve', 'progressed', 'watching', 're-watching', 'cos', 'i', 'just', 'dont', 'want', 'rush', 'something', 'thats', 'been', 'revelation', 'me.I', ""'ve"", 'only', 'ever', 'seen', 'cowboy', 'bebop', 'series', 'other', 'seen', 'lots', 'anime', 'films', 'im', 'still', 'newbie', 'only', 'started', 'last', 'year', 'when', 'i', 'moved', 'hong', 'kong', 'guy', 'uni', 'halls', 'ken', 'i', 'owe', 'mate', 'are', 'Im', 'England', 'childish', 'scorn', 'i', 'have', 'smile', 'when', 'i', 'tell', 'someone', 'im', 'really', 'falling', 'love', 'anime/manga', 'real', 'anger-maker', 'especially', 'when', 'idea', 'interesting', 'story', 'watch', 'british', 'soaps', 'frankly', 'would', 'make', 'want', 'hang', 'i', 'could', 'make', 'depressing', 'title', 'music', 'reading', 'reviews', 'american', 'audience', 'greater', 'appreciciation', 'what', 'animation', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'country', 'also', 'responsible', 'buffy', 'not', 'gon', 'jump', 'conclusions.Anyhoo', 'what', 'can', 'i', 'say', 'trigun', 'reviews', 'ive', 'read', 'pretty', 'much', 'cover', 'reviewers', 'cant', 'stand', 'cant', 'stand', 'vash', 'pacifism', 'well', 'lol', 'what', 'tell', 'hahaha', 'may', 'i', 'just', 'say', 'one', 'absolutely', 'expressionistic', 'animation', 'character', 'pulling', 'fantastic', 'face', 'sharping', 'serious', 'silly', 'millysecond', 'get', 'dont', 'dont', 'criticise', 'dont', 'western', 'animation', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'cahunas', 'try', 'something', 'so', 'overtly', 'experimental', 'japan', 'probably', 'not', 'so', 'new.Anway', 'ive', 'realised', 'i', 'havent', 'said', 'anything', 'best', 'stuff', 'i', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'characters', 'vash', 'truly', 'one', 'time', 'greatest', 'heroes', 'ive', 'encountered', 'story', 'telling', 'fact', 'hes', 'golden', 'hero', 'astounded', 'other', 'story', 'used', 'similar', 'idea', 'hero', 'not', 'one', 'ive', 'seen', 'anyway', 'lol', 'wolfwood', 'well', 'im', 'choking', 'up', 'just', 'typing', 'name', 'so', 'im', 'gon', 'stop', 'there.I', 'feel', 'i', 'wish', 'i', 'could', 'tell', 'so', 'much', 'more', '2.35', 'night', 'frankly', 'only', 'way', 'do', 'justice', 'watch', 'Words', 'arent', 'sufficient.And', 'i', 'still', 'have', 'see', 'last', 'three', 'ones', 'know', 'when', ""'re"", 'approaching', 'end', 'story', 'know', 'will', 'stay', 'forever', 'cant', 'bear', 'gon', 'finish', 'soon', 'state', 'mind', 'what', 'storytelling', 'can', 'be', 'pinnacle.Love', 'peace']",N/A
