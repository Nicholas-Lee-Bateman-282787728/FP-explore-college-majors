In the first half of the workout, you will do a variety of arm movements, most of which require you to hold the arms at shoulder level or above. Although the voiceover instruction suggests that these moves will tone your biceps and triceps, I felt them mostly in my shoulders, which quickly became fatigued. Eventually, you move on to working the chest and ribs, mainly through isolation movements. The final ten minutes of this workout are performed on the floor. You'll start with several non-traditional abs exercises--eg, leg lifts while propped on your elbows--and then you'll work on more traditional crunches. The workout finishes with several yoga-inspired stretches, and the total time comes in at about 28 minutes.Overall, I found this to be an okay light toning routine. However, because the workout concentrates on the upper body, there is no footwork, which removes the fun factor (as well as the cardio work) that exists in other videos of this series (eg, Basic Moves). If you're interested in toning the arms and abs and are looking for something a bit different, this workout might be for you, but if you want to experiment with some fun bellydance moves, you'll probably want to try one of the other videos in the Bellydance for Fitness series.",3,Review of Arms and Abs only,1122249600,"07 25, 2005",2005,1458,"['Bellydance', 'Fitness', 'Arms', 'Abs', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'alone', 'Amazon', 'no', 'longer', 'separate', 'listing', 'video', 'designed', 'tone', 'upper', 'body', 'using', 'bellydance-inspired', 'movements', 'first', 'half', 'workout', 'will', 'do', 'variety', 'arm', 'movements', 'most', 'require', 'hold', 'arms', 'shoulder', 'level', 'above', 'voiceover', 'instruction', 'moves', 'will', 'tone', 'biceps', 'triceps', 'felt', 'mostly', 'shoulders', 'quickly', 'became', 'fatigued', 'Eventually', 'move', 'working', 'chest', 'ribs', 'mainly', 'isolation', 'movements', 'final', 'ten', 'minutes', 'workout', 'are', 'performed', 'floor', ""'ll"", 'start', 'several', 'non-traditional', 'abs', 'exercises', 'eg', 'leg', 'lifts', 'propped', 'elbows', 'then', ""'ll"", 'work', 'more', 'traditional', 'crunches', 'workout', 'finishes', 'several', 'yoga-inspired', 'stretches', 'total', 'time', '28', 'minutes.Overall', 'found', 'be', 'okay', 'light', 'toning', 'routine', 'However', 'workout', 'upper', 'body', 'footwork', 'fun', 'factor', 'as', 'well', 'cardio', 'work', 'other', 'videos', 'series', 'eg', 'Basic', 'Moves', ""'re"", 'interested', 'toning', 'arms', 'abs', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'bit', 'different', 'workout', 'might', 'be', 'want', 'experiment', 'fun', 'bellydance', 'moves', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'try', 'one', 'other', 'videos', 'Bellydance', 'Fitness', 'series']","Bellydance Fitness for Beginners - Arms, Abs, Hips, Buns & Thighs"

As the title promises, this video focuses specifically on working butt and legs for beginners.Overall the workout isn't strenuous, except I found the hip drops & hip lifts section really worked my butt tough in a way that non-bellydance workouts haven't targeted.The 25min workout includes the following: leg stretchs, inner thigh lifts, outer thigh lifts, knee bends (like mini-lunges), butt squeezes (I wish they explained these a little more), lots of hip circles, hip drop & hip lifts (these definitely were tiring), walk on balls of feet, thigh stretch (unless you're agile & have strong abs, skip this cause it's easy to hurt your back and knees), cat stretch.I like how the instructors wore simple outfits that weren't distracting.This video is for people new to belly dancing who want to learn individual moves and practice their strength & coordination in doing those moves.

Morse,"[185, 195]","I don't technically have the DVD yet (it's in transit as I post this), but, I have both routines on video.If this is a direct transfer, it can't help but be wonderful :).Neena and Veena have made my boring exercise maintenance into a fun and muchly-anticipated part of my week. I did these routines near daily for 3 months, and then transitioned them to once or twice a week (doing other things, also). But, during that three months I improved my flexibility (I can reach *past* my toes!), my muscle tone, and learned to pinpoint my muscle isolations.These two workouts have a good mix of &quot;traditional&quot; exercise movements (squats, lunges, crunches, etc.) and movements unique to belly dance. I think the twins provide an almost flawless method to learn the movements, as the routines are slow enough that you don't need a separate teaching segment, but, fast enough to keep you improving once you know what you're doing. I really appreciate their teaching style. They wear snug spandex workout clothes with dainty scarves, so, you can clearly see what they're doing. Plus, there's two of them, so, if the camera angle is a little &quot;off&quot; on one, you can see what to do from looking at the other.The arms and abs routine is dedicated to strengthening your arms, rotating through a variety of arm movements, and an almost yoga or pilates style ab workout. These seem to be a bit more general, in the sense that you're working your full arms and shoulders for the arm routine, and most of your abdominals at the same time, for the ab routine.The hips, buns and thighs routine is more focused on isolated movements. There's also a good stretching section that I really like.What's particularly nice is that they teach you &quot;real&quot; belly dance movements but in the structured environment of exercise routines. So, you can enjoy these workouts if you're looking for something a little different, or, to build up a basic collection of movements. However, if you want to learn to dance properly, you'll have to look elsewhere.

667101,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00005N8AL,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[6, 6]","The last section of this workout video has perhaps one of the most amazing Bellydance routines I've yet to see. It was simply inspirational. Just a pity the credits were already moving along the left side obscuring some of the dancing. The outfit Veena or Neena Didasha was wearing was incredible. I want one. ;( Pout. It was like her entire body was under her control, very sexy.This workout is based on the ancient form of artistic movement and is one of the most sensual dances you will ever see or experience. Veen and Neena look like twins to me and they are rather cute to watch. They have been practicing Bellydance since childhood and have traveled throughout the Middle East and India to perform and develop their techniques. They have also performed for film, television, theater, music videos and even during Academy Awards.I've tried other Bellydance workouts and this was is definitely different. It is not all belly dancing. It is a Bellydance themed workout. Normally, the dancers show you routines to follow. They normally show you the basics first and then you put them into a routine.With that said, I managed to make it through this entire workout. There are some pretty difficult moves while you are sitting on the floor. Can we say Cleopatra? Yeah, that one was difficult.This really reminded me a lot of Pilates and some yoga more than dancing. Perhaps it is more the preparation before dancing. I guess this is the theme and you do get to shake your hips around a lot which is very freeing if you like to loosen up your lower body and back. It is always fun to do goddess-type workouts.I'd not recommend this workout to anyone with a bad lower back, that is for sure. Your legs are also going to get a good workout and this is definitely a dancer-level workout. Your feet have to be in good condition to do some of the up-on-your-toes dancing. You don't have to be overly coordinated to follow this particular workout because each exercise is done over and over and you can eventually catch up before the next exercise starts.It is unique, that I'll say. You won't really be doing any dance routines, just some moves and some isolated lower body moves.Some of the things you do: circling hips, standing still and moving your hips in various directions, beautiful and traditional hand movements, stretching, cat stretch, Pilates moves, some yoga poses. It seems that half of the workout is on the floor and the other half is standing.Loved the music and this workout will help you develop your sexy side.Also Look for:Hip Drop Hip HopPure Sweat Cardio ShimmyBellydance BoogieThe Sensual Art of bellydance Mucic Fast RhythmsThe Sensual Art of Bellydance Music Slow RhythmsAlso look for ""Discover Bellydance"" - This is the series that includes Basic Dance, Beyond Basic Dance and Mystic Dance.

667102,A9LATUEW5YOI4,B00005N8AL,S. Gardner,"[1, 1]","Make no mistake: this is a workout video with bellydance moves, not a bellydance video.  It will teach you some bellydance moves, but it will not make you into a bellydancer; you'll need another video (or a real-life instructor) for that!First off, Neena and Veena are both pleasant instructors, with nice attitudes in their introductions.  Their choice of outfits is also good, as both are wearing simple sports bras and leggings with a small hip scarf; this makes it easy to follow their movements without distracting costumes getting in the way.  (Amusingly, they're not identical dancers.  One is smoother with her hips, the other with her arms.  It's interesting to see how they vary in their styles.)  Their smiles look a bit forced after a while, but one can hardly blame them for having tired cheeks.The moves are simple and easy to follow, though the faceless narrator isn't the best at giving cues, so you really have to watch the twins to see what they're doing.  You do definitely need some coordination, especially when first getting the hang of the moves, as a lot of time is not spent on each one before moving on to the next and they're not broken down well in the instruction.  Some positions are also named but not explained, such as the Cleopatra positions.  This won't matter after the first go-through, but it makes it more difficult initially.The production values are mediocre.  It doesn't much matter in the exercise portion, but I find that the bonus dance segments and their intricate costumes suffer from some blurring and pixelization.Overall, despite my complaints, I rather like this video.  It doesn't make you sweat, but you'll be feeling the muscles you use.

667107,ACZEW7QN3XCTH,B00005N8AL,Virginia Mercurio,"[3, 6]","I bought this DVD for two reasons:1. I wanted to learn some belly dance.2. I needed to get into better shape.As far as workouts go, it isn't bad.  I used this DVD and one or two others and I managed to go down a pants size.  Which was great for me, because as I said, I needed to get into better shape.  The flow on the first part of the program was nice.  You work your way down your body so to speak, going from your arms to your ribs and finally your abs.  However, I'm sure there are better ways to do crunches.  I don't know about anyone else, but I cannot for the life of me hold my legs straight up in the air without using method of support.  I just can't do it.  I have to prop my legs up on my couch when I do this just so I can continue along with them.  The second half seemed a bit more stop and go.  It focused more on isolating than an actual flow.  Which is alright, since there was some sort of sense in one exercise following another.However, if you want to learn how to belly dance while getting in shape....pick up a different DVD.  While there are definitely elements of belly dance used in the workouts, unless you are at least vaguely familiar with the movements, and correct posture, they aren't going to teach you.  They only really break down two movements on the entire DVD: chest circles in the first half and HUGE hip circles in the second half.  There is no break down of snake arms (unless you count the voice over saying ""Elbow, wrist, fingers....elbow, wrist, fingers"" as you do it), no break down of hip lifts and drops.  You just launch into it.  Call me crazy, but if this were my first foray into hip lifts and drops, I'd want to know how to do them properly so I don't strain anything.  There is no instruction on how NOT to do these moves or why you want to do it the way the twins are.  I don't remember if they cover any of this on their Basic Moves and Cardio DVD, but I gave up on that one pretty quick.Production wise, it's okay.  I really could've done without the little dance and speech.  The short dance they do at the beginning of each half would have made more sense on a strictly instructional DVD.  Seriously, why do a dance for me if I'm not going to learn how to do it?  The set is nice and the music is lovely.  The voice over isn't too intrusive.  The twins, however....yeah.  One of them seemed like she was miserable and would rather be anywhere but there, even when she was almost sort of smiling.  The other had the biggest, most fake plastic smile I've ever seen while projecting a ""Look at me!  Isn't this the most fun ever??!!  Now look at me some more!!!!!!"" attitude.  It was kind of annoying.  Maybe because this wasn't an instructional DVD, but there was no sense of genuine enthusiasm, fun, or encouraging.  Neena and Veena just seemed so wooden.All in all....if you have a basic grasp of the moves from an instructional DVD or beginner's class, this is a great DVD to pick up to apply belly dance to a workout.  If you've never learned how to belly dance, learn the basics and then get this DVD.",2,"As a work out, it's not bad.
