100585,A2WUU68EEPMTTQ,0790732920,Avid Reader,"[0, 0]","I forget that this film is based on truth.  I like that Devon Sawa plays the brother of JTT's character. Those two were big teen hearthrobs in ""my day.""  BUT I was obsessed w/JTT ---this film is really cute and inspiring.  Small town kids that go off & end up living out their big dreams of being professional videographers for companies such as National Geographic, etc..The movie explains it better... what I love most about the film, is the way JTT plays his character, who gets crapped on often by his older brothers.  But JTT's character is the endearing, can't help but love him sort.  He's the glue between the brothers, the only one with his head on straight.  I like the fact that the brothers share a comradary, despite their crapping on JTT's character..I like the adventures they go on, and... how in the end, they come home with an amazing story to tell their small town, etc. It's old, and the budget couldn't have been too too high since some of the special effects with the animals were...mmm.. hoaky, but---dude, the movie is worth the watch, at least once or twice---but again, it's based on a true story, and I find it inspirational.  JTT's character is endearing and loveable, you just love him in the film.

100587,AB34G6VKP28L,0790732920,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[9, 11]","Unless you've been living in Congo, you've heard of Marty Stouffer... well, even there you've probably run into him once or twice. One of the greatest wildlife photographers in the world, Marty has his own story to tell... and it wasn't easy getting to the place where he is right now. &quot;Wild America&quot; is his story... or rather, the story of his kid brother Marshall. How much of it is true is unknown, although I have the feeling that most of the following adventure has been &quot;enhanced&quot; to make a good story. And a good story it is... in the form of a really tall tale.More than often humorous and a few times absurd, &quot;Wild America&quot; runs on adrenaline, keeping the audience on their toes... since they never know what might happen next. From a gator-infested swamp to the snowy mountains of Montana, these boys never seem to run out of adventure. There are encounters with wolves, snakes, wild horses, eagles, bears, alligators, and other predators, all filmed in that beautiful close-up quality of the real-life Stouffer. Particularly memorable is the montage of Wild America clips shown during the end credits... some of his most best-known and award-winning work.Yes, at times the film is corny and it tries too hard to be everything -- a comedy, a romance, an adventure, a family flick -- but it's enjoyable simply for its casting, storyline, and animals. Parents should be forewarned that it contains quite a helping of profanity. While the film won't appeal on a wide range to older teens, younger ones will probably be drawn in by the great adventure upon which the boys embark. Girls in particular will enjoy this one, if only for the pleasure of watching a nearly all-male cast. JTT is exceptional.&quot;Wild America&quot; cites more on the side of irony than realism... but it's still quite a ride.",4,Suspended Reality,1025827200,"07 5, 2002",2002,1838,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'living', 'Congo', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Marty', 'Stouffer', 'well', 'even', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'run', 'once', 'twice', 'One', 'greatest', 'wildlife', 'photographers', 'world', 'Marty', 'own', 'story', 'tell', 'was', ""n't"", 'easy', 'getting', 'place', 'where', 'right', 'now', 'quot', 'Wild', 'America', 'quot', 'story', 'rather', 'story', 'kid', 'brother', 'Marshall', 'How', 'much', 'true', 'unknown', 'have', 'feeling', 'most', 'following', 'adventure', 'been', 'quot', 'enhanced', 'quot', 'make', 'good', 'story', 'good', 'story', 'form', 'really', 'tall', 'tale.More', 'often', 'humorous', 'few', 'times', 'absurd', 'quot', 'Wild', 'America', 'quot', 'adrenaline', 'keeping', 'audience', 'toes', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'next', 'gator-infested', 'swamp', 'snowy', 'mountains', 'Montana', 'boys', 'never', 'seem', 'run', 'out', 'adventure', 'are', 'encounters', 'wolves', 'snakes', 'wild', 'horses', 'eagles', 'bears', 'alligators', 'other', 'predators', 'filmed', 'beautiful', 'close-up', 'quality', 'real-life', 'Stouffer', 'Particularly', 'memorable', 'montage', 'Wild', 'America', 'shown', 'end', 'credits', 'most', 'best-known', 'award-winning', 'work.Yes', 'times', 'film', 'corny', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'everything', 'comedy', 'romance', 'adventure', 'family', 'flick', 'enjoyable', 'simply', 'casting', 'storyline', 'animals', 'Parents', 'should', 'be', 'forewarned', 'quite', 'helping', 'profanity', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'wide', 'range', 'older', 'teens', 'younger', 'ones', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'drawn', 'great', 'adventure', 'boys', 'embark', 'Girls', 'particular', 'will', 'enjoy', 'one', 'only', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'nearly', 'all-male', 'cast', 'JTT', 'exceptional.', 'quot', 'Wild', 'America', 'quot', 'more', 'side', 'irony', 'realism', 'still', 'quite', 'ride']",N/A
