Remember how that DVD was annoying as it was a weird cut together  of several different shows? Well, this isnt, and it is SO MUCH BETTER. One night, one performance, as it should have been in the first place. If you are a fan of Manson before it started going wrong from GROTESQUE onwards, then this bluray is for you. Great HD quality (1080i though not 1080p) and sound all good as well. We can only hope Manson fins passion again one day as he did on the albums up until this point on this release. Saw his last 2 x tours - he looks bored and going through the motions now onstage, unlike his performance on this GREAT live set.

1281445,A2PVMN4SH0MJON,B002OOG6YY,hi13ts,"[3, 5]","As it was mentioned before, Manson's can clearly be head singing while the microphone was down or his mouth was closed. I don't know if he lip-synched that particular show because of vocal problems (it was one of the last shows on the tour after all) and he half-assed his performance, or it was dubbed in during the editing of the BluRay to fix any mistakes he may have made. The band seems to be playing live so I can't imagine the audio being from a different show(s) (unless the band plays the exact same thing in the exact same way in every show which is highly unlikely). Besides the editing flubs, the concert must've been killer to witness live. I'm sad to say that I was never able to experience Manson in his good years (pre-2007). His latest performances have been terrible and his band is no longer solid. Either drugs have caught up to him or age, but given the fact that his former master, Trent Reznor, is older than he is (albeit slightly) but far surpasses him in music, image and performance, I would say that the drugs have finally caught up and whatever emotional problems Manson has been harboring has finally taken its toll. I hope he gets his act together, move Twiggy back on bass, and start writing some albums with effort. Until then, I'm happy to be able to listen to his good albums and watch old videos of his performances on the internet.I'm also hoping for an official blu-ray release of a show of his other tours (most notably the Grotesque tour and Against All Gods tour).",3,Poor editing in an otherwise great concert.,1289520000,"11 12, 2010",2010,1505,"['was', 'mentioned', 'Manson', 'can', 'clearly', 'be', 'head', 'singing', 'microphone', 'was', 'down', 'mouth', 'was', 'closed', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'lip-synched', 'particular', 'show', 'vocal', 'problems', 'was', 'one', 'last', 'shows', 'tour', 'half-assed', 'performance', 'was', 'dubbed', 'editing', 'BluRay', 'fix', 'mistakes', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'band', 'be', 'playing', 'live', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'audio', 'being', 'different', 'show', 'band', 'exact', 'same', 'thing', 'exact', 'same', 'way', 'show', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'editing', 'flubs', 'concert', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'killer', 'witness', 'live', ""'m"", 'sad', 'say', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'experience', 'Manson', 'good', 'years', 'pre-2007', 'latest', 'performances', 'have', 'been', 'terrible', 'band', 'no', 'longer', 'solid', 'drugs', 'have', 'caught', 'up', 'age', 'given', 'fact', 'former', 'master', 'Trent', 'Reznor', 'older', 'slightly', 'far', 'music', 'image', 'performance', 'would', 'say', 'drugs', 'have', 'finally', 'caught', 'up', 'emotional', 'problems', 'Manson', 'been', 'harboring', 'finally', 'taken', 'toll', 'hope', 'act', 'together', 'move', 'Twiggy', 'back', 'bass', 'start', 'writing', 'albums', 'effort', 'then', ""'m"", 'happy', 'be', 'able', 'listen', 'good', 'albums', 'watch', 'old', 'videos', 'performances', 'internet.I', ""'m"", 'also', 'hoping', 'official', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'show', 'other', 'tours', 'most', 'notably', 'Grotesque', 'tour', 'Against', 'All', 'Gods', 'tour']",N/A

1281447,A2MIP3AQVSF2SS,B002OOG6YY,"Teh Arbitrageur ""PM""","[0, 0]","Those who have seen the original-issue version of MM's GG&G; will instantly understand why they need to pick this Blu-Ray up: that older title was in regular DVD quality, and was put together from several concerts with the video cut up into tiny 2-second pieces and stitched together.  But worse, metal genius Twiggy Ramirez was on the outs (he left the band for a decade or so), to be punished by removing almost all traces of him from the video.  Seriously, you got about five minutes of John 5 shaking his head &#34;no&#34; (probably to indicate &#34;no, I can't possibly rock any harder&#34;, or perhaps &#34;no more tonight, I can't see with all this sweat in my eyes&#34;), and 20 seconds of Twiggy stomping around the background in a hausfrau's dress with combat boots.But this superb Blu-Ray is no mere cleanup of old footage to make a buck: this is a totally new video: it has the same songs, but is composed entirely from the single tour-ending show in Los Angeles, with a more relaxed editing speed.  We don't get to see Marilyn in as wide a variety of costumes, but this is true HD quality, with excellent audio, of a single outstanding concert.  For me, though, the best part is Twiggy, restored in the footage as a full member of the band -- you can actually see him just as much as the other supporting musicians.",5,"Twiggy out of the doghouse, and in HD",1379808000,"09 22, 2013",2013,1328,"['who', 'have', 'seen', 'original-issue', 'version', 'MM', 'GG', 'G', 'will', 'instantly', 'understand', 'why', 'need', 'pick', 'Blu-Ray', 'up', 'older', 'title', 'was', 'regular', 'DVD', 'quality', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'several', 'concerts', 'video', 'cut', 'up', 'tiny', '2-second', 'pieces', 'stitched', 'together', 'worse', 'metal', 'genius', 'Twiggy', 'Ramirez', 'was', 'outs', 'left', 'band', 'decade', 'so', 'be', 'punished', 'removing', 'almost', 'traces', 'video', 'Seriously', 'got', 'about', 'five', 'minutes', 'John', '5', 'shaking', 'head', '34', '34', 'probably', 'indicate', '34', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'rock', 'harder', '34', 'perhaps', '34', 'more', 'tonight', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'sweat', 'eyes', '34', '20', 'seconds', 'Twiggy', 'stomping', 'background', 'hausfrau', 'dress', 'combat', 'boots.But', 'superb', 'Blu-Ray', 'mere', 'cleanup', 'old', 'footage', 'make', 'buck', 'totally', 'new', 'video', 'same', 'songs', 'composed', 'entirely', 'single', 'tour-ending', 'show', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'more', 'relaxed', 'editing', 'speed', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'Marilyn', 'as', 'wide', 'variety', 'costumes', 'true', 'HD', 'quality', 'excellent', 'audio', 'single', 'outstanding', 'concert', 'though', 'best', 'part', 'Twiggy', 'restored', 'footage', 'full', 'member', 'band', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'supporting', 'musicians']",N/A
