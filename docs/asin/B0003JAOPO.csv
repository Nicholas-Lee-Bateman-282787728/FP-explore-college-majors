854855,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B0003JAOPO,Byron Kolln,"[8, 8]","The 1980 remake of LITTLE MISS MARKER does visibly capture a lot of the 1930s feeling of the original Damon Runyon story, but the film as a whole seems under-done.Walter Matthau plays the curmudgeonly bookie ""Sorrowful"" Jones, who finds himself lumbered with a six-year-old girl, known only as ""The Kid"" (played by Sara Stimson).  Throw a beautiful society dame into the mix (Julie Andrews at her loveliest), and you have one of the classic comedies.The original version of LITTLE MISS MARKER was filmed by Paramount Pictures in 1934, starring Shirley Temple as ""The Kid"" and Adolphe Menjou as ""Sorrowful"".  In terms of sheer charm, the original wins hands-down, but the 1980 remake must be commended for re-creating the tale for a new generation.Walter Matthau and Julie Andrews manage to conjure up some sort of chemistry--but despite that fact you'd never imagine them as a romantic couple.  Sara Stimson is appealing in the title role, and there are some fun cameos from Tony Curtis and Lee Grant.Universal has released LITTLE MISS MARKER on a bare-bones DVD--fullscreen transfer, and there isn't even a menu.  However, the price is nice, and the movie itself is quite enjoyable.
