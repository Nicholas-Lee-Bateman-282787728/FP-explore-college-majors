This isn't the type of movie you sit around and watch on the couch with your friends and a bowl of popcorn - it's a strange and surreal fairy tale. Every time I watch it, I am absolutely amazed that one person put this entire film together by herself, and that she was dedicated enough to stick with the project over the 13 years that it was in production. If you're looking for action or comedy, this movie isn't for you - if you are looking for a film that is unlike anything else out there, then I definitely recommend it. It's beautiful - I am so glad I bought it. If you like independent films, this is about as independent as it gets!",5,BRILLIANT,1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,674,"['movie', 'absolutely', 'amazing', ""n't"", 'type', 'movie', 'sit', 'around', 'watch', 'couch', 'friends', 'bowl', 'popcorn', 'strange', 'surreal', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Every', 'time', 'watch', 'am', 'absolutely', 'amazed', 'one', 'person', 'put', 'entire', 'film', 'together', 'herself', 'was', 'dedicated', 'enough', 'stick', 'project', '13', 'years', 'was', 'production', ""'re"", 'looking', 'action', 'comedy', 'movie', ""n't"", 'are', 'looking', 'film', 'anything', 'else', 'there', 'then', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'beautiful', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'bought', 'like', 'independent', 'films', 'about', 'as', 'independent']",Blood Tea and Red String

I had come across it many moons ago while looking for another DVD title, then spent the next year with it on my Wishlist. I'm glad I finally broke down one day and bought it for myself. It's an interesting film, not quite as I expected, but it is beautiful, and a strange, alluring triumph. One woman, over the course of a decade, doing all the set design and filming and lighting herself, shot a feature length stop motion animation of this magnitude. It shows that this film was a learning process for her, as the shots start out too fast, and in some places too flickery from lighting changes, but it isn't too long in to the film she finds her rhythm. And sometimes the intended story points aren't always as obvious to the viewer as they were to the film maker in her fevered creative state, but you can learn to forgive her these faults, seeing as she's providing us with such an amazing journey.This film is a real achievement that needs to be seen to be believed.",4,An achievement,1255824000,"10 18, 2009",2009,1030,"['did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'going', 'film', 'had', 'come', 'many', 'moons', 'ago', 'looking', 'DVD', 'title', 'then', 'spent', 'next', 'year', 'Wishlist', ""'m"", 'glad', 'finally', 'broke', 'down', 'one', 'day', 'bought', 'interesting', 'film', 'not', 'quite', 'expected', 'beautiful', 'strange', 'alluring', 'triumph', 'One', 'woman', 'course', 'decade', 'doing', 'set', 'design', 'filming', 'lighting', 'shot', 'feature', 'length', 'stop', 'motion', 'animation', 'magnitude', 'film', 'was', 'learning', 'process', 'shots', 'start', 'out', 'too', 'fast', 'places', 'too', 'flickery', 'lighting', 'changes', ""n't"", 'too', 'long', 'film', 'rhythm', 'sometimes', 'intended', 'story', 'points', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'as', 'obvious', 'viewer', 'were', 'film', 'maker', 'fevered', 'creative', 'state', 'can', 'learn', 'forgive', 'faults', 'seeing', 'providing', 'amazing', 'journey.This', 'film', 'real', 'achievement', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed']",Blood Tea and Red String

I probably would have liked it more were it shorter as the lack of dialogue lost my interest after about 30 minutes.  If you are a die-hard Stop-motion animation person, then by all means rent, borrow, or buy this film.  For the average person I do not think you will like this very much as it is not a very ""mainstream"" movie by any accounts.

Knowing that it was made by one person over 13 years only increases my admiration. Truly a labor of love! Rich colors, fascinating characters that capture both the innocence & exaggerated fears of a child's world, memorable images that seem almost archetypal -- just stunning. It has the look & flavor of a very old tale, repeated over countless generations. If you're looking for something different, something very far from the mass market animation that seems to exist solely to sell cheap merchandise, then you won't go wrong here.

1014943,AUTBHG6070SL4,B000HIVIRY,"wiredweird ""wiredweird""","[14, 15]","I'm really not sure how to describe this movie, so I'll start with the bare facts. Cegavske appears to have started from some art-school sketchbooks, and assembled a gorgeous stop-animation, supposedly taking 13 years to complete. She did all the design, scripting and animation, so this was clearly a labor of love. She created remarkable characters and sets, beautifully crafted. The composer she engaged for the score did an outstanding job, especially in the unearthly tones of the mouses' dance.All of which says nothing about the characters and plot of the movie, which I still can't quite put words to. It carried the sense of a fully-elaborated dream world, but of someone else's dreams. The different beings seemed to act out rituals of deep importance, all of which eluded me. Rich, detailed imagery abounds, almost like the imagery of a Tarot deck - but with all of the arcane meanings unspoken. The viewer rides along in this wordless world, sensing the characters' urgency but never making out the reason for it.Cegavske's puppets and props bring that baffling world to life. Even though this medium has been used for years in children's entertainment, make no mistake: this is for grownups. Skittish children might not tolerate the deaths of characters, or scenes like the ""blood tea."" A few moments drag; the script's pacing seemed uneven, and the puppet's motions never flowed smoothly. I can't let the little things get in my way, though. This stands as an incredible work of creativity, and a glimpse into another mind's imaginings.-- wiredweird",5,Magical and mysterious,1206835200,"03 30, 2008",2008,1563,"[""'m"", 'really', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'describe', 'movie', 'so', ""'ll"", 'start', 'bare', 'Cegavske', 'have', 'started', 'art-school', 'sketchbooks', 'assembled', 'gorgeous', 'stop-animation', 'supposedly', 'taking', '13', 'years', 'complete', 'did', 'design', 'scripting', 'animation', 'was', 'clearly', 'labor', 'love', 'created', 'remarkable', 'characters', 'sets', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'composer', 'engaged', 'score', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'especially', 'unearthly', 'tones', 'mouses', 'dance.All', 'nothing', 'characters', 'plot', 'movie', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'put', 'words', 'carried', 'sense', 'fully-elaborated', 'dream', 'world', 'someone', 'else', 'dreams', 'different', 'beings', 'seemed', 'act', 'out', 'rituals', 'deep', 'importance', 'eluded', 'Rich', 'detailed', 'imagery', 'abounds', 'almost', 'imagery', 'Tarot', 'deck', 'arcane', 'meanings', 'unspoken', 'viewer', 'along', 'wordless', 'world', 'sensing', 'characters', 'urgency', 'never', 'making', 'out', 'reason', 'it.Cegavske', 'puppets', 'props', 'bring', 'baffling', 'world', 'life', 'Even', 'medium', 'been', 'used', 'years', 'children', 'entertainment', 'make', 'mistake', 'grownups', 'Skittish', 'children', 'might', 'not', 'tolerate', 'deaths', 'characters', 'scenes', 'blood', 'tea', 'few', 'moments', 'drag', 'script', 'pacing', 'seemed', 'uneven', 'puppet', 'motions', 'never', 'flowed', 'smoothly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'little', 'things', 'get', 'way', 'though', 'incredible', 'work', 'creativity', 'glimpse', 'mind', 'imaginings.', 'wiredweird']",Blood Tea and Red String
