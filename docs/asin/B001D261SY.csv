It packs in SO MUCH, yet everything just flows perfectly for some reason. Probably because I'm not a huge fan of workouts where you are on the floor alternating burpees and planks then jumping back up to do more high cardio. (They work, but I like doing a workout all one way). The only segment I do not like for some reason is when she suddenly does this part where you do side lunges with no weights and then go down for a ""bootcamp"" with pushups. I just do something else during that small section. To me for some reason I just don't like doing those. But the music and moves I REALLY LOVE! Basic, easy, and not too repetitive. The cardios are speced into 4 small segments alternating with light weight moves. A GREAT Circut type workout. She is very motivating, and this workout just flys by. I'm not sure if it really burns 500 calories (maybe for overweight beginners), but usually the smaller you begin to get after awhile, the harder it is to lose because you have to workout much harder or cut your calories even more. But I wont underestimate that this workout burns at LEAST 300 calories. ;) I also like that this workout is a lot longer than most of the Pink FIRMS since the newer ones just seemed like they got more shorter in time, and too easy. This one brings back the way the FIRM used to be (when the FIRMS were ran by Anna Benson and had the class and mirror stage-THOSE were more challanging which is why I STILL use those and own almost every single one of them-and still collecting!)

She's an upbeat instructor, and her moves are innovative, challenging, and really fun.  With that being said, once again, the music in this workout is just enough out of sync to be a distraction, during the cardio sections.  It's not such an issue during the sculpt sections or during the abs section at the end, but it definitely is for the cardio.  And it's a real shame, because they use some good music during this workout.As for the title, ""500 Calories,"" I wear a heart rate monitor for all the workouts I do.  I actually burned 457 calories during this workout, for the first time, and I admit that I did ground some moves and follow the beginner modification for a little bit.

On the back of the box it does say up to 500 calories but according to my heart rate monitor I burned 370 in one hour which is less than I burn on the elliptical machine in 45 minutes. As for the moves, some were unsafe for the knees. I have had knee surgery and at the end of the twisting lunge segment my knee was throbbing. Sometimes she moves too fast and doesn't really clarify what the moves are. A plus, I do consider myself to be in good if not great shape and this DVD gave me a good workout for the most part.

I burn no less than 470 calories each time I do this workout according to my heart rate/calorie counter watch.I will admit that when I first started working out to the Firm I hated it.  The moves and routines were hard to follow and went way too fast. I was miserable since I am poorly coordinated.  I kept with it though because they were the only workout DVD's I had at the time (I had purchased multiple DVD's of the pink Firms at one time), and because I blamed it on my poor coordination.  I kept trying the workouts because I was determined to improve my coordination.  I would do my own weird version of the moves whenever I couldn't follow along properly and found that I still burned calories.  It took about 5 months of working out 3 times a week for me to finally follow along well.  Once I got it, I found that this is a great workout that tones while burning calories.

1178327,A2H83QCA8NDZ0H,B001D261SY,C. Day,"[1, 1]","I am a long- time FIRMIE and I know that not every FIRM DVD has been good.  But, Kelsie continues to amaze me.  She is VERY fit and her routines tend to be more challenging &#8211; which is perfect for the intermediate- advanced.  I would not say that this DVD is a good starting place for beginners.I don&#8217;t have a heart monitor so can&#8217;t speak to the calorie burn-  but it was a good SOLID workout.  Even after one run through-  I can tell this is going to be a favorite!  A couple of notes:CUING:  I have seen lots of complaints about her cuing.  There are a few times where she is late on the cue-  but the sequences are simple and repetitive enough that even if you miss the first go-round,  you&#8217;ll have the chance to try it again.  Besides, it needs to be varied enough that you don&#8217;t get bored by the 5th time through!  Kelsie is actually pretty clear on her instructions.  You might try her other tape-  Pump, Jump and Jab-  it is shorter and not as fast moving.WEIGHTS:  There are a few times where Kelsie suggests medium- heavy weights.  I would advise against it.  This workout is much more cardio-focused than sculpting focused.  I would keep the weights to whatever you consider your cardio weight.  For me (experienced exerciser)-  that is 5 lbs.Anything more than that could increase your risk of injury because of all the fast arm movements.  Heavy up on some of the other FIRM sculpting DVDs where you can slow down and focus on the muscle.LUNGES :  Kelsie usually is heavy on the lunges-  but this time she seemed to favor dips.  Whew!  These are easier on the knees.  However, do be careful when doing the twisting lunges&#8230;  keep your feet under you and take a shorter stride until you are comfortable with the move.Overall-  this workout has become one of the first ones I reach for.  It was a good mix of cardio and cardio-weight training (signature FIRM!) that delivers a good sweat!  Highly recommended.",5,A new favorite!

I borrowed this workout and though it was a pretty good workout I would probably not purchase it for myself.The dvd clocks in at a bit over 60 minutes and unless you choose not to, handweights are needed for the weight training segments.  I don't use weights everday so I kept to light 3 lb. weights and these worked fine for me. I felt like I had a workable weight for me while I did the exercises so I did the moves right without sacrificing quality.Here are my pros and cons:Pros: Energetic instructor, but not over-the top annoying.  She is in good shape without being a cartoon stick figure.  Exercises are generally easy to follow. Your heart rate does increase and you work large and small muscle groups together to torch those calories and make your workout count.Cons: Nothing really new here, I wouldn't say boring, but I can't see myself turning this to this over and over. For me to want to do it repeatedly I find I have to really like it alot and it needs to be something unique.  This wasn't it.

Recently I received a gift card and was anxious to purchase some more Firm videos, this was one of them.  I read the reviews carefully and was worried that I would not ""get"" it at first, but I was wrong.  Kelsey (my first experience with her) does each move enough times and tells you what moves to add with enough notice, so that by the end of set I was moving with them!  Yes, there are some stumbles; some moves I had never seen before, but overall these were really fun moves and very different from other videos I've done from The Firm.The video is 60 minutes long, which is definitely one of the longest I own now, but I didn't get bored and wasn't staring at my clock the whole time.  I just kept having more and more fun as the video went on!  Very sweaty too!I wear a HRM when exercising, so I can easily say that this video lives up to its name.  Last night was only my second time completing, and that was without weights so that I could get the hang of it, and I easily went over 500 calories.  I can't wait to see what I'll burn when using weights!  Kelsey may also be my new favorite instructor, although I love them all!Overall an awesome video that I'm incorporating into my collection.

There are a lot of lunges which may be hard on the knees, but I didn't have any real problems. She also does a lot of back toning exercises which is a nice change because a lot of DVDs seem to avoid them. She alternates back and forth between cardio and weights and the segments are fairly short, especially towards the end.  I liked how she had different styles for her cardio sections so it wasn't all aerobics, dance or athletic intervals.  I didn't have any major problems with her cuing.  I got lost in one section the first time through, but I was able to start right back up again and keep going. After a couple times through the DVD I can anticipate what is coming.I don't have a heart rate monitor so I don't know how many calories I actually burned, but I was tired and dripping in sweat by the end of the workout.

Yes, Kelsie is not good at cuing the moves, she moves too fast and she does not coordinate her workout to the music. All of these things will mess up your learning curve whether you are new to the Firm or a familiar follower like me.  This just goes to show that being a good fitness instructor is a skill and Kelsie sure could use more practice.It took me 5 workouts to get the moves down.  But once I did, it was totally worth it.  The workout is a great one!!  After 5 workouts I have blasted through a fitness plateau that I had been going through for about a month.  The strength training sequences and the kick-butt abs are my favorite.The cardio sequences are where you will have the most trouble following along and this is probably the reason why alot of people who bought this dvd don't like it.  I can't say I blame them.  However, just like anything else new you try, you have to give yourself a chance to learn it. You really have to ask yourself how much of your time is worth learning it.

I've almost completely stopped rotating the old step box workouts.However, as others have mentioned, there are music/timing issues.  I don't know if it's Kelsie or some problem with production.  It doesn't matter; they should have fixed it before they released it.  There is no reason why they could not have synced the music in post so that it is in time with the video.There don't seem to be any issues like this with any of the workouts by Allie and Allison, but there are two other workouts with Emily Welch that have the same problem, so I think it's post-production, not the instructors.

It's challenging but easy to follow because the moves are basic (although the workout level is more geared to intermediate exercisers).  There are your usual step touches, jacks and grapevine moves so as you're already familiar with those basics, you don't have to concentrate on too hard moves that you can't keep up with.

Along with a new set, the workout features a new instructor (Kelsie Daniels), and while she isn't horrible, she isn't up to the standard of say ... Jen Carmen, or Allie Strickland. She's lacking ryhthm, and it's difficult to learn a new workout routine when the rhythm isn't there to follow. She's also lacking cueing skills, so you never really know what's coming next because she doesn't announce it beforehand, or even go through the moves once to allow the viewer to become familar with them. That gets really frustrating because before now, Firm workouts have always been well cued. In addition, the workout just isn't ""fun"". It feels disorderly, if not a bit chaotic in nature, and the movements seem jerky and awkward at times. I give it two stars, and will probably sell it.

For one thing, the rhythm of the movements is off sometimes from the music.  It's not the whole time, but it does occur a few times, especially during cardio intervals, and it's annoying.  My other problem was that Kelsie didn't give much warning sometimes.  She would switch from one movement or combo to another and not tell you she was changing until she was already doing the new movement.  Both of these problems were worsened by the fact that the music was often about the same volume as Kelsie's voice.  So all of these things will make your experience a little more frustrating for your first time, but at least the late cueing and volume balance won't be such a problem after doing the workout a few times.  I'm also hoping that I'll be able to ignore the beat being off, but we'll see.Enough with the bad, here's the good.  It's a well-rounded, challenging workout.  Kelsie has some new creative moves and combinations that keep the workout interesting.  And like I said in the title, she packs this workout with lunges, so do yourself a favor and don't do this on a day when your legs are already sore.  I'm also glad to get another full hour workout - so many of the ones I've been getting from them lately are around 40 - 45 minutes.",4,Kelsie is the lunge queen!,1228608000,"12 7, 2008",2008,1358,"['Overall', 'good', 'workout', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'doing', 'again', 'do', 'have', 'few', 'minor', 'complaints', 'one', 'thing', 'rhythm', 'movements', 'sometimes', 'music', 'not', 'whole', 'time', 'occur', 'few', 'times', 'especially', 'cardio', 'intervals', 'annoying', 'other', 'problem', 'was', 'Kelsie', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'warning', 'sometimes', 'would', 'switch', 'one', 'movement', 'combo', 'not', 'tell', 'was', 'changing', 'was', 'already', 'doing', 'new', 'movement', 'problems', 'were', 'worsened', 'fact', 'music', 'was', 'often', 'same', 'volume', 'Kelsie', 'voice', 'things', 'will', 'make', 'experience', 'little', 'more', 'frustrating', 'first', 'time', 'least', 'late', 'cueing', 'volume', 'balance', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'such', 'problem', 'doing', 'workout', 'few', 'times', ""'m"", 'also', 'hoping', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'ignore', 'beat', 'being', 'off', ""'ll"", 'see.Enough', 'bad', 'here', 'good', 'well-rounded', 'challenging', 'workout', 'Kelsie', 'new', 'creative', 'moves', 'combinations', 'keep', 'workout', 'interesting', 'said', 'title', 'workout', 'lunges', 'so', 'do', 'favor', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'day', 'when', 'legs', 'are', 'already', 'sore', ""'m"", 'also', 'glad', 'get', 'full', 'hour', 'so', 'many', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'been', 'getting', 'lately', 'are', 'around', '40', '45', 'minutes']",Firm: 500 Calorie Workout

In fairness, I did enjoy some of the moves and I did feel that the instructor, Kelsie, was trying to keep the routines interesting. It's possible that if you knew the moves well and could keep moving you would burn the advertised 500 calories. But when so much starting and stopping is involved to try to determine what's happening, you miss the opportunity to really achieve that.My complaints:*The moves are not explained at all.*The pace is rapid, which is good for cardio purposes, but makes the viewer feel very confused.*The only times I felt sure that I was engaged in proper form were the weight/toning segments.*Most of the cardio exercises seemed to be based on lunges and about halfway through the DVD, I felt like it was becoming monotonous on top of confusing.*Many reviewers have said they felt it was challenging but I feel like there are many other DVDs that leave this one in the dust. I didn't feel like I had been challenged enough and if you do aerobics avidly, you'll likely be disappointed.*This is a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things but I didn't like the music and didn't feel like the exercises fit well with the music.*This has been brought up previously but the poor cueing of the video really does create the possibility for injury and definitely made me confused. I did not like the odd segmentation of the DVD whatsoever.*Also a minor complaint but I would have liked a bar on the screen to track progress level.

1178356,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B001D261SY,Sneaky Burrito,"[0, 0]","If you had asked me yesterday what my favorite Firm workout was, I'd have said this one, ""The 500 Calorie Workout"" with Kelsie.  That's still true, but after having gone over it carefully yesterday, prior to writing this review, I will admit that I can see why some people don't care for it.First, who do I think is going to be the most likely to see a benefit from this workout?  I'd list two primary qualifications.  (1) Someone who has done at least one or two other Firm DVDs before and is thus familiar with the vocabulary and some of the moves.  (2) Someone who is a reasonably advanced exerciser.What you get with this DVD is a workout that's approximately one hour long.  You start with a warm up that includes a bit of cardio work, then you alternate between weights and cardio for awhile, ending with a strength segment that starts with standing ab work; this then moves down to the floor where you do some additional upper body work and a few more abdominal exercises.  If you count the warm-up, you get 5 cardio and 5 weights segments standing up, plus the standing abs/floor work strength segment, then a cool-down stretch.  Each segment is fairly short; many are in the 5-7 minute range.  I happen to like this because, if there's one section you don't like, it's over quickly.Each cardio section and each weights section are different; the combinations are not repeated.  You'll see a bit of kickboxing, a bit of dance, and a fair number of movements that don't fit so neatly into a category (though you might call them ""aerobics"").You do need weights for this workout.  Although you can start without weights if you need to, you'll have more of a challenge if you do use weights.  I stick with 5-8 pound weights, but 2-3 would work if you're not as advanced.  You may want to have more than one set of weights, as some exercises are more difficult than others.Pros:*I think the sections with weights are very good.  I particularly like that many of the moves with weights are compound movements using two or more major muscle groups (often one upper body and one lower body).  These moves take balance and coordination and help to improve core strength.*One participant performs modified moves.  Unlike some other exercise DVDs I've experienced lately, this woman is on screen enough -- at the appropriate times -- for you to actually see what she's doing and to follow her, if that's what you need.*I find that the participants in the background have practiced enough that their moves are basically in unison with Kelsie's.  (There's no one struggling along, half a step behind, as in some other DVDs I've done/reviewed lately.)*The warm-up is long enough to warm up your muscles for a bit *before* stretching.  Based on everything I've heard lately, this is what fitness professionals have been advising for some time.*The cool-down stretch is also fairly long, and you stretch all the major muscle groups (some more than one time, using different moves).  You don't feel cheated when you're done with this.*The length of the workout in general is something I like.  I've noticed a trend the past few years to shorten workouts and shorten them again, until you're doing maybe 30 minutes of work.  I like that this one's an hour.  I just feel I get so much more benefit from a longer workout than from a shorter one.*Kelsie has what I would call an ""athletic"" build.  She has muscle definition in her upper arms, for example, but she doesn't look like a bodybuilder.  To me, anyway, she looks like a healthy, fit woman, which is really the whole point.  She's believable as a workout leader.Neutral/Ambivalent:People are going to be of two minds about the cueing/instructional time.  Being somewhat familiar with other Firm DVDs before trying this one, I'll honestly admit to not noticing how fast the instructional segments were.  I might've struggled the first couple of times I tried this DVD; I really don't remember.  But after doing this workout two or three times, I pretty much felt like I had the moves down.  What generally happens is that you start out doing one move, then add on another and another until you've got an entire sequence built up.  Then, you perform the sequence a handful of times on both sides of the body.  I will agree with the other reviewers that yes, Kelsie's instruction is pretty fast, and she definitely uses a lot of Firm-specific vocabulary.  You may very well find yourself stumbling around for a bit, especially the first few times you try this workout.  I know I did.At any rate, I did get to the point where I could follow along easily, and was grateful that the instructions building up to the combinations were relatively short.  I can see, however, why some people might not care for that, why they might want longer and/or slower build-ups to combinations.  So please consider your own skill level and preferences here.For what it's worth, I don't know how many calories I actually burn during this workout because I don't have a heart rate monitor.  I do feel like this is the most difficult Firm workout for me to complete (of the ones I've tried).Note that there's not a lot of discussion of good form.  However, I felt that all the participants demonstrated good form (e.g., knees not going over toes during squats, backs not bowed during push-ups, etc.).  Because there are several weightlifting segments, you will not want to do this workout every day; give the muscle groups you use during this DVD at least a day to rest before working them again.Cons:*I find the music annoying.  It's electronic/manufactured and mostly played on endless loop, though it does change from workout segment to workout segment.*The camera angle changes for no apparent reason.  (However, you *can* see every move being performed, and there are no odd zooms as I have seen with some other workout DVDs.)*Some moves are difficult, even for me.  ""Jazz boxes"" definitely fall into this category.  To this day, I still can't do one properly.  There may be other moves that throw other people off.  If you are not coordinated, it will take you a much longer time to figure all of this out, especially in view of what I wrote in the ""neutral"" section above.  (""Practice makes perfect"" may not exactly be true here, but practice certainly does lead to improvement.)On balance, I find this to be a challenging workout.  It's also one of my favorites from the Firm.",4,"my favorite Firm workout, but beware",1383523200,"11 4, 2013",2013,6407,"['had', 'asked', 'yesterday', 'what', 'favorite', 'Firm', 'workout', 'was',

I tried it at least 4 times and the last time I decided it just wasn't good enough to waste my time with.  I exercise about 6 days per week, sometimes 2x per day with Jillian Michaels, Billy Blanks, Denise Austin, Shaun T, other FIRM dvds, etc. and they are better.  I felt like the weights were too light for me to burn calories, but yet she was moving too fast for me to be able to use heavier weights or switch to heavier weights when I felt like I needed to.  The cardio parts where she didn't use weights were good, but I still didn't feel like they were enough to burn a lot of calories and you need a lot of space to move around, which I don't have at home!  I also purchased Calorie Explosion from the FIRM, so I'm going to try that one and see if it's better.With all this said, I probably shed a couple of pounds adding this to my weekly routine, but it wasn't enjoyable enough or hard enough for me to keep doing it and a couple of pounds is probably all I will lose with this, while with Jillian I think I lost 10!!",2,500 calories?

1178361,A39MD3N21Z8OUU,B001D261SY,The Mrs.,"[5, 5]","I bought this DVD while shopping for odds and ends at a retailer. It was cheaper than I had seen it before and since I was back and forth as to get it or not, I decided to take the plunge. It is by far one of the best fitness DVD buys I have made, ever!!This DVD has a lot of both positive and negative reviews and I have for a while been curious about this, but wasn't sure it would be for me. I have been able to work my way back up to a high intermediate fitness level after time of from surgery and illness, and I found that I actually went faster than the instructor!! Kelsie is a great lead in this DVD, my second experience with her. My first was with the Firm Wave, and I DID NOT click with her for that workout. So since I have been hesitant to purchase DVDs with her as the lead. After doing this DVD, I am now searching for her DVDs. This workout is approx 60 minutes in length and it moves you quickly throughout the DVD, never slowing down or breaking the choreography down.You use dumbbells in this DVD but I would classify this as a Cardio Workout. She doesn't heavy up and uses only 1 set, sometimes using both in one hand for bicep or back work. Since the ""toning"" segments are short and quick, there isn't much rep work to consider this a decent strength workout. It does though allow you to hit both aerobic and anaerbic heart rate zones and the calorie burn is high. Since I have only done this DVD once (I've only had it for 6 days) I used 3 lbs dumbbells. This would be the perfect DVD to use weighted gloves and a belt if you have access to those. Because she moves so quickly, it is highly recommended that you have experience with the Firm workouts, mainly the Pinks as the choreography is called out by term name and there is no breakdown, only adding to it. She keeps you moving with no time so slow down. Although in between cycles/segments (every 5+ minutes) you march in place for 10-15 seconds to catch the next song's beat. A perfect amount of time for water breaks and I took those often!! I have noticed that a common complaint is that she is off of the beat and that she moves too quickly. I personally didn't notice the music all that much bc I was working so hard, I tend to tune music out once I am working at a certain intensity level. I also noticed that I was ahead of her by 1-2 beats in choreography!! She was moving fast, but apparently, I can and did move faster...often! Let's keep in mind here that I am a high intermediate, this DVD is rated for Intermediates by Fitness Forums. Again, knowing the Firm Terminology will go a long way and make the ""too fast"" pace a lot more doable on the first go round.Dear Kelsie does a lot of high impact modifications, those with knee or back issues take notice to that. I have both. I wear a knee brace and was able to do all the moves but 1 or 2 comfortably with my knees. She does this movement that goes from a lunge into a push up, back into a lunge, then standing. That was the move my knee had problems with. I modified to a range of motion that was better for me, but it was still a little tricky, especially with a brace as it limits range of motion. There are also a couple of multi-muscle/4 limbs moves that incorporate balance (usually standing on one leg and doing a leg lift with the opposite and arm work). These were the ones that my lower back had trouble with. I think that for the average person, someone who doesn't have a history with lower back issues would be just fine. I noticed that I was slacking in the ""ab tightening"" form on these too bc I was concentrating on doing so many other things at the same time. If your core is strong and/or you can keep the focus on keeping your core tight, it'll be fine. BUYER BEWARE: If you DO NOT like lunges, do not purchase this DVD; she does them often!I absolutely love the choreography in this one. It has a little bit of everything from mambos, to kickboxing, to traditional-retro style floor work. The variety kept me very intrigued and intuned to this DVD. The abs section at the end is a little tougher than some of the other pinks and for me, I had to follow the beginner and even do a less intense version than the beginner modifier. I like I said, have low back issues so Ab work is a ""must"" for me, but it can be a difficult task. She does a lot of movements that are working the upper and lower abs at the same time; moving the legs in/out or up/down. I found that If I kept my uppers engaged the entire time, the lower ab movements weren't as hard on my back. I still have to work up to the full range and full rep count, but it gives me something to strive for. I can't say enough how much I really loved this workout!! I even told my husband ""thank you"" at least a dozen times bc it is just so much fun! Kelsie is a great lead and her instruction/cueing is almost perfect. The pace is quick, lets not be fooled about that, but it is so doable. That is IF you are familiar with the Firm Pinks. Kelsie tends to be a ""faster"" lead from what I can tell, but this DVD is meant to challenge you. I was able to pick up the choreography the first time through, and most ppl should be able to by the 2nd or 3rd. Using 3s and 5s would make this a Cardio Knockout and high calorie burner. I lift at the gym so I don't need the strength work via DVD. This is one that you can easily grow with, upping the weights as you get stronger, adding a weight belt or gloves, and doing all high impact-there's a lot of those modification for sure!I'd buy this DVD all over again in a heart beat no questions asked. As far as Calorie Burn, I burned over 500 and I know it'll be even higher next time. I had to stop a few times for unrelated issues, brining my heart rate down. I use a Polar F6 for those that are curious about Heart rate monitors.",5,It takes the Calorie Cake!!
