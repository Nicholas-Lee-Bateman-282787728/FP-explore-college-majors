156911,AAGB53LDUFNDG,0792846699,Bart,"[1, 2]",This is one of the scariest and funniest and campiest horror/monster movies I have ever seen. The title sort of says it all - a mad scientist keeps a brain alive and locked in a closet even after its body is destroyed. Of course things go horribly wrong for the doctor and anyone unlucky enough to get near him. The acting is just as good as it needs to be and the director knew he was just putting together a screamer so he just has fun with it. The result is a great early 1960s popcorn flick that I could watch again and again.,5,Seriously Good Exploitation Film,1154131200,"07 29, 2006",2006,530,"['one', 'scariest', 'funniest', 'campiest', 'horror/monster', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'title', 'sort', 'mad', 'scientist', 'brain', 'alive', 'locked', 'closet', 'even', 'body', 'destroyed', 'course', 'things', 'go', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'doctor', 'anyone', 'unlucky', 'enough', 'get', 'acting', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'be', 'director', 'knew', 'was', 'just', 'putting', 'together', 'screamer', 'just', 'fun', 'result', 'great', 'early', '1960s', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'could', 'watch', 'again', 'again']",N/A
156912,A3Y6GNHCOER58,0792846699,Billie Mann,"[2, 3]","""Alive... without a body... fed by an unspeakable horror from hell!""So reads the tagline for this laughter-inducing horror film.Dr. Bill Cortner is an egotistical and arrogant physician who likes to experiment with bodies in his spare time. In the first scene, after exclaiming, ""He's dead! I can't do any harm!"" and ""Sure! I've made a few mistakes, but I've learned from them! Learned!"" he is allowed by his physician father to take over in the operating room when a patient dies on the table.Good Dr. Bill is next seen recklessly driving himself and his sweet, horny fiance Jan out to his country house; the car crashes, he salvages Jan's head from the burning wreckage, wraps his prize in his jacket, and runs the rest of the way with it like he's going for a touchdown during a football game. Once he gets to his lab, he sets her all up and presto! It's ""Jan in a pan!"" as I have heard this film referred to in the past.Almost immediately his once-sweet lady (well, her head anyway) becomes a screeching shrew hoarsely calling out such lines as ""Revenge! I hate him for what he's done to me!"" as the desperate doctor goes on the hunt for a suitable body to use for restoring his girl back into something more, uhm, fully functional. His search takes him to strip joints and a beauty contest, to name two avenues he tries before he finds someone he believes to be a suitable candidate, telling her, ""I'm going to cut your face off and give away your body, ah ha ha!"" as she innocently laughs along.To add to the fun, there is of course the wretched assistant with a mangled arm; one of the doctor's earlier ""mistakes"", and the ""thing"" locked in a closet in the lab. There's also the continual soundtrack of horns and sleazy stripper-like music. As far as the gore factor, this movie is actually pretty gruesome for its time, although the blood seems to be rather conveniently spilled (downstairs, but not upstairs, for instance), and ""Jan in a Pan"" laughs more maniacally as the movie progresses.It's never explained how the head can speak without lungs or a body, although it must be the *new and improved* ""Adreno-serum"" as it's called that's being pumped into Jan's head, but then again who cares? Continuity flubs abound and serve to add to the camp factor. And look for the ending credits, which list the movie as ""The Head That Wouldn't Die"".You can find this movie on Amazon.com in a DVD version that has the original film by itself, and also the film as part of an episode of Mystery Science Fiction Theatre 3000, the now-defunct hit TV show. Well, all I had to review this film with was my raggedy old videotape that appears to be degrading, so after watching it again, I gave into temptation and ordered the Amazon DVD of it.

156916,A1TONI9A0YFOD6,0792846699,Bruce Rux,"[18, 19]","The rating isn't for quality.  This movie is one of the cheapest productions ever put on film.  It literally defines schlock.  The performances are so uneven, they come off as amateur night at the community theater.  The cinematography is so bad, the day-for-night shooting slips in and out.  Several scenes sound as if they were recorded in a tin can  -  and probably were.  It's more padded than Dolly Parton, and not as delightfully.On the other hand, once you get past all that, this is one of the most unsettling movies ever made.  If it were any more demented or disturbing, it would have to be directed by Tobe Hooper and rated ""X"".Psychopathic surgeon Jason Evers gets in a car accident speeding home to check on one of his failed experiments, and ends up decapitating fiancee Virginia Leith.  He carries her head to the lab, and keeps it alive in a pan of his special serum, which he uses in limb-grafting experiments of so-far unsatisfactory results.  Leith is extremely unhappy with being kept alive in her present condition, and even more so when she discovers Evers intends to murder the most beautiful woman he can find so he can put Leith's head onto a new body.  The serum Evers keeps Leith's head alive with gives her telepathic power, and she develops an unsettling friendship with the failed experiment Evers was running home to check on in the first place  -  a hideously deformed giant golem in a locked closet, constructed of badly grafted-together tissues.  The longer Leith is kept unnaturally alive, the more twisted and hateful she becomes, until she and the deformed monstrosity create an insidious alliance to kill Evers and his criminal assistant.What makes this unbelievably cheap p.o.s. work is the conviction of the performers  -  Leith, especially  -  and the pervasive dementia, throughout.  The soundtrack is incredibly effective, eerie beyond belief, often creeping up and down your spine.  The visuals are genuinely unsettling in their very simplicity, to the point that you don't even notice the rubber bald-cap on the hideous golem until repeat viewings.  The violence is shuddery-awful, voyeuristically lingering on some of the most gruesome things imaginable  -  like a man's arm being ripped out of its socket, and the camera's following him through the house while he bleeds to death, the demonic head in the pan cackling delightedly throughout.In short:  cheap beyond belief, but more often than not incredibly effective.

Dr. Bill Cortner (Jason Evers), a new-breed doctor who bravely goes where most doctors (at least, those not named Frankenstein) fear to tread, could have just let his fianc&eacute;e Jan (Virginia Leith) die after her head gets chopped off in an auto accident.  Instead, he grabbed her head, hustled it up to his personal lab, set it up all nice and neat in his own special recipe of life-maintaining gravy, and went out in search of a new body for the woman he loved.  But does Peggy appreciate everything Bill has done for her?  Nooooo.  Not one bit.  All she does is turn into the mouth that wouldn't shut up and makes ""you should have let me die"" her new mantra.  Apparently, all of her nice qualities were located in her torso because she turns into a vengeful little spitfire who proclaims herself the leader of the doctor's army of mutant creations (all one of them).  In her defense, Dr. Cortner is one weird dude with a pretty disturbing hairstyle, but she knew that before she dropped 95% of her body mass.  Maybe she's just mad that the selective doctor is seeking an upgrade model for her new body, but you can hardly blame the guy for that.  Why settle for pancakes when you can have the whole hungry man's breakfast?The Brain That Wouldn't Die is everything a campy cult classic should be, with its radical experimental medicine, bloody amputations, a talking decapitated head, a deformed monster, and a really cheap set.

Jokes are made about the ridiculous acting, and the story line is pretty cheesy, but it is still a neat little movie despite it's flaws.  And it does have its flaws, don't get me wrong.For one thing, at least on the dvd tee version, the soundtrack often sounds like it was dubbed at a later time than the actual film.  Also some of the scenes seem extra long, like the producers were desperately trying to pad the movie to get it up to feature film length.  (The whole scene of the drive, car wreck and desparate run of the mad scientist with his fiancee Jan's head takes up like 10 minutes of the movie and it was only a little over an hour in running time after it was finished)The (unintentionally?) humorous parts are what makes the movie worth viewing.  1. The doc goes looking for a body to replace the one that Jan lost in the crash.  The first place?  A strip joint.  Hey, that's where I'd look.  Way to go Doc!  2.  The communication between Jan's head and the thing in the closet.  Kinda like those old rigamaroles for communicating with animals.  She talks and the thing raps once for Yes or twice for No.  (Despite some reviews I've seen the communication does not appear to actually be ""telepathic"".)Everybody in this movie seems to have it in for the doctor.  His assistant alternately respects him, but also resents im for the botched arm transplant.  Jan resents him for keeping her head alive.  And the thing in the closet resents him because the doc keeps him in a closet.  I would resent him too if he locked me in a closet...Once again, as in previous reviews, even if the movie is not up to your tastes, you still get a pretty decent T-shirt.

156923,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,0792846699,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[11, 14]","THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE was considered so distasteful in 1959 that several cuts and the passage of three years was required before it was released in 1962.  Today it is difficult to imagine how anyone could have taken the thing seriously even in 1959; the thing is both lurid and lewd, but it is also incredibly ludicrous in a profoundly bumptious sort of way.The story, of course, concerns a doctor who is an eager experimenter in transplanting limbs--and when his girl friend is killed in a car crash he rushes her head to his secret lab.  With the aid of a few telephone cords, a couple of clamps, and what looks very like a shallow baking pan, he brings her head back to life.  But is she grateful?  Not hardly.  In fact, she seems mightily ticked off about the whole thing, particularly when it transpires that the doctor plans to attach her head to another body.As it happens, the doctor is picky about this new body: he wants one built for speed, and he takes to cruising disconcerted women on city sidewalks, haunting strip joints, visiting body beautiful contests, and hunting down cheesecake models in search of endowments that will raise his eyebrow.  But back at the lab, the head has developed a chemically-induced psychic link with another one of the doctor's experiments, this one so hideous that it is kept locked out of sight in a handly laboratory closet.  Can they work together to get rid of the bitter and malicious lab assistance, wreck revenge upon the doctor, and save the woman whose body he hankers for?  Could be!Leading man Jason Evers plays the rougeish doctor as if he's been given a massive dose of spanish fly; Virginia Leith, the unhappy head, screeches and cackles in spite of the fact that she has no lungs and maybe not even any vocal chords.  Busty babes gyrate to incredibly tawdry music, actors make irrational character changes from line to line, the dialogue is even more nonsensical than the plot, and you'll need a calculator to add up the continuity goofs. On the whole THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE comes off as even more unintentionally funny than an Ed Wood movie.Director Joseph Green actually manages to keep the whole thing moving at pretty good clip, and looking at the film today it is easy to pick out scenes that influenced later directors, who no doubt saw the thing when they were young and impressionable and never quite got over it.  The cuts made before the film went into release are forever lost, but the cuts made for television have been restored in the Alpha release, and while the film and sound quality aren't particularly great it's just as well to recall that they probably weren't all that good to begin with.Now, this is one of those movies that you'll either find incredibly dull or wildly hilarious, depending on your point of view, so it is very hard to give a recommendation.  But I'll say this: if your tastes run to the likes of Ed Wood or Russ Meyers, you need to snap this one up and now!

Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[2, 2]","""The Brain That Wouldn't Die"" is definitely a large step up from ""The Beast of Yucca Flats"", but how much of a compliment is that?NOT IN THE RUNNING FOR WORST B FILM EVER:This film is watchable even though it runs for 80 minutes and has quite a bit of dialogue in it. Let's say it promises more than it delivers, but the possibility of the delivery looms until the very end when indeed something of a horrific event does finally take place.WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT?:Joesph Green doesn't waste any time in his direction of ""The Brain That Wouldn't Die"". It begins on an operating table with action and dialogue of a philosophical nature. The theme of the film is established at the onset -- just how far can we humans go playing God without suffering dire consequences.The rest of the film plays out as a ""Science Goes Amuck"" formula with some sexploitationist detours which are not altogether unentertaining, but do detract from the seriousness of the film. Of course, there is decent pacing and a building of tension as the clock ticks. The brain can only be kept alive for ""48-60 hours"" before something must be done, but then there is more B-film stuff as the plot does thicken. We have henchmen and experiments gone amuck in the foreground as our anti-hero deals with the crisis of the brain that wouldn't die. We have our anti-hero scientist scoping for a body to replace his fiancee's who has just a head, but no shoulders.All the while, things are happening in the basement as the brain of this sweet girl turns into an evil thing with fiendish designs and desire only for revenge against the man who is trying desperately to put her head back on a body. Preferably, a really nice one, but only if he can find one quickly thereby helping science in the process. His fiancee has enlisted the aid of an unseen fiend in the closet and his arrival waits till the explosive climax, although he has already killed the scientist's henchman through an opening in the door where he is fed. The end is hardly unexpected, but shows more than the usual effort for this type of film, especially in the realm of imagination.When all is said and done, this is definitely a ""'B'-MOVIE SLEEPER FOR THE BRAIN DEAD""!ABOUT THE DVD:This is a decent single-layer transfer and is relatively glitch-free.",3,"A ""B"" MOVIE SLEEPER FOR THE BRAIN DEAD!",1131321600,"11 7, 2005",2005,2282,"['Brain', 'That', 'Would', ""n't"", 'Die', 'definitely', 'large', 'step', 'up', 'Beast', 'Yucca', 'Flats', 'how', 'much', 'compliment', 'NOT', 'IN', 'THE', 'RUNNING', 'FOR', 'WORST', 'B', 'FILM', 'EVER', 'film', 'watchable', 'even', '80', 'minutes', 'quite', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'Let', 'say', 'more', 'possibility', 'delivery', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'indeed', 'something', 'horrific', 'event', 'finally', 'take', 'place.WHAT', 'IT', 'ALL', 'ABOUT', 'Joesph', 'Green', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'direction', 'Brain', 'That', 'Would', ""n't"", 'Die', 'operating', 'table', 'action', 'dialogue', 'philosophical', 'nature', 'theme', 'film', 'established', 'onset', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'can', 'humans', 'go', 'playing', 'God', 'suffering', 'dire', 'consequences.The', 'rest', 'film', 'out', 'Science', 'Goes', 'Amuck', 'formula', 'sexploitationist', 'detours', 'are', 'not', 'altogether', 'unentertaining', 'do', 'detract', 'seriousness', 'film', 'course', 'decent', 'pacing', 'building', 'tension', 'clock', 'ticks', 'brain', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'kept', 'alive', '48-60', 'hours', 'something', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'then', 'more', 'B-film', 'stuff', 'plot', 'thicken', 'have', 'henchmen', 'experiments', 'gone', 'amuck', 'foreground', 'anti-hero', 'deals', 'crisis', 'brain', 'would', ""n't"", 'die', 'have', 'anti-hero', 'scientist', 'scoping', 'body', 'replace', 'fiancee', 'who', 'just', 'head', 'while', 'things', 'are', 'happening', 'basement', 'brain', 'sweet', 'girl', 'evil', 'thing', 'fiendish', 'designs', 'desire', 'only', 'revenge', 'man', 'who', 'trying', 'desperately', 'put', 'head', 'back', 'body', 'Preferably', 'really', 'nice', 'one', 'only', 'can', 'find', 'one', 'quickly', 'thereby', 'helping', 'science', 'process', 'fiancee', 'enlisted', 'aid', 'unseen', 'fiend', 'closet', 'arrival', 'waits', 'till', 'explosive', 'climax', 'already', 'killed', 'scientist', 'henchman', 'opening', 'door', 'where', 'fed', 'end', 'hardly', 'unexpected', 'more', 'usual', 'effort', 'type', 'film', 'especially', 'realm', 'imagination.When', 'said', 'done', 'definitely', ""B'-MOVIE"", 'SLEEPER', 'FOR', 'THE', 'BRAIN', 'DEAD', 'DVD', 'decent', 'single-layer', 'transfer', 'relatively', 'glitch-free']",N/A

I first saw photos from it in &quot;Mad Monsters&quot; magazine back in the early 1960s, and was fascinated by the image of a woman's head kept alive in a pan. To an eight year old boy hooked on trashy horror movies, this was &quot;it&quot;! I finally saw &quot;Brain&quot; a few years later on late-night TV, and was hooked! Flash-forward to the 1980s, where, to my delight, I had discovered that this sleazy little film had an enormous cult following. Is it the preposterous story? The cheesy lab set? (it looks like an empty rumpus room in a suburban home) The poker-faced performances? The battling strippers? The sleazy and infectious music &quot;The Web&quot;? (of which I am the proud owner of on a 45 single), or the pizza-faced, hunchbacked, cone-headed giant locked in the closet? It's ALL of these things! This EC comic-like film is irrestible, a VERY guilty pleasure, like eating a 5-pound box of very cheap candy that makes your teeth ache. But just try and look away! It even dawned on me recently that the role of &quot;Doris&quot;, the disfigured and bitter cheesecake model, is rather like a grouchy Bettie Page, posing, in the words of mad doctor Bill Cortner, &quot;for a bunch of neurotics&quot;. I had the pleasure of talking to the late director Joseph Green on the telephone in 1989. I told him that &quot;Brain&quot; was one of my all-time favorite trash films, and he graciously said that he was pleased that I had such fond memories of it. &quot;Fond&quot; is an understatement! The picture quality on this DVD is brutally crisp, so you can enjoy all of the tacky sets, bad makeup jobs, and tawdry costumes. I may add that the long-missing footage, i.e. the bickering and battling strippers, and Leslie Daniel's long, drawn out and VERY bloody death scene have been restored.

156930,A11XKY4EIU2KNR,0792846699,"Johny Bottom ""Insane and lonely guitarist""","[7, 11]","Just what was the point of this bit of celluloid? Surely countless horny teenagers went to the drive-in to make out in the back seat while `The Brain that wouldn't Die' was projected on the screen. Is this movie truly just another bad sci-fi movie that deserves to be lumped into the mountainous pile of 50's black and white garbage cinema? My friends, the answer is no.This story is not about a brain, but rather a head. It wasn't just a head that wouldn't die; it was a head that was refused the privelidge of death. So where was the soul? Does it live in the heart, or is that merely a muscle that circulates blood? According to this movie, the body is useless and a head is what holds our being. Can telepathic powers be conjured up when the brain has no distractions from the body? Possibly. It is said the average human uses three percent of its brain. Imagine the power that could be unleashed if the mind has to take care of nothing but it's own being. The brain performs all involuntary actions such as heartbeat, pulse, and digestion. Imagine the relief a brain would feel if all those functions were no longer its responsibility! What untold and undiscovered secrets could a brain tell us if it was allowed to explore rather than care for a body?And why was a woman's brain chosen for this movie? Could it be a salute to the brave and misunderstood Marie Antoinette, the last Queen of France? Surely when Marie Antoinette ascended the stairs to the guillotine, her thoughts were on the death that she so desired after the torment she had been through at the hands of the Revolutionaries. Her pain was indescribable indeed. Research tells us that the human brain can survive up to seven seconds if violently separated by the body. Marie Antoinette was very much aware of the cheering crowd as her head was held up by the hair and displayed to them.So how does the brain in this movie survive for over an hour? The answer of course is the `Life Serum' that pumps into an aluminum TV dinner tray that the doctor has provided. What exactly was this serum? Certainly people will laugh it off as bad 50's silliness, but consider this. Alchemists longed for this secret. Not only did alchemists try to turn rock, brass, and tin into gold, but they also sought out the mystery of eternal youth. Does the brain age like the body, or does the body merely grow old and die leaving a totally capable and sufficient brain to die with it? Could a brain of a hundred year old person be placed into the body of a teenager and continue living? Of course! If only technology could catch up with man's dream of eternal youth.Ultimately this movie brings a serious message to the females. You're never good enough to satisfy your man. Let's face it, I mean look at yourself. You are no Marilyn Monroe and you never will be. Men want beautiful women, not you. You are not satisfied with your body either, no woman is. Oh what a better world we would have if women's brains could be placed in the body chosen with her man's specifications in mind. Maybe then we'd rather talk to you and spend time with you instead of watching ESPN.And what of the monster thing in the closet? That should be obvious to even the average ignoramus, the creature represents God. Yes that's right. Man was not meant to know such things, and when we make even a small break through, God puts us right back in our place. The world needs flat-chested, overweight, and thunder-thighed women. Why? Beats me, but it is not for me to know or question. They must serve some purpose if they are here. It probably has something to do with the alcohol industry. I mean men wouldn't really drink gallons of beer if all women were beautiful right?",5,"More than just a movie, a lesson.",1053388800,"05 20, 2003",2003,3703,"['Just', 'what', 'was', 'point', 'bit', 'celluloid', 'Surely', 'countless', 'horny', 'teenagers', 'went', 'drive-in', 'make', 'out', 'back', 'seat', 'Brain', 'would', ""n't"", 'Die', 'was', 'projected', 'screen', 'movie', 'truly', 'just', 'bad', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'be', 'lumped', 'mountainous', 'pile', '50', 'black', 'white', 'garbage', 'cinema', 'My', 'answer', 'no.This', 'story', 'not', 'brain', 'rather', 'head', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'head', 'would', ""n't"", 'die', 'was', 'head', 'was', 'refused', 'privelidge', 'death', 'So', 'where', 'was', 'soul', 'live', 'heart', 'merely', 'muscle', 'blood', 'According', 'movie', 'body', 'useless', 'head', 'what', 'being', 'Can', 'telepathic', 'powers', 'be', 'conjured', 'up', 'when', 'brain', 'distractions', 'body', 'Possibly', 'said', 'average', 'human', 'three', 'percent', 'brain', 'Imagine', 'power', 'could', 'be', 'unleashed', 'mind', 'take', 'care', 'nothing', 'own', 'being', 'brain', 'involuntary', 'actions', 'such', 'heartbeat', 'pulse', 'digestion', 'Imagine', 'relief', 'brain', 'would', 'feel', 'functions', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'responsibility', 'What', 'untold', 'undiscovered', 'secrets', 'could', 'brain', 'tell', 'was', 'allowed', 'explore', 'rather', 'care', 'body', 'why', 'was', 'woman', 'brain', 'chosen', 'movie', 'Could', 'be', 'salute', 'brave', 'misunderstood', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'last', 'Queen', 'France', 'Surely', 'when', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'ascended', 'stairs', 'guillotine', 'thoughts', 'were', 'death', 'so', 'desired', 'torment', 'had', 'been', 'hands', 'Revolutionaries', 'pain', 'was', 'indescribable', 'indeed', 'Research', 'human', 'brain', 'can', 'survive', 'up', 'seven', 'seconds', 'violently', 'separated', 'body', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'aware', 'cheering', 'crowd', 'head', 'was', 'held', 'up', 'hair', 'displayed', 'them.So', 'how', 'brain', 'movie', 'survive', 'hour', 'answer', 'course', 'Life', 'Serum', 'aluminum', 'TV', 'dinner', 'tray', 'doctor', 'provided', 'What', 'exactly', 'was', 'serum', 'Certainly', 'people', 'will', 'laugh', 'off', 'bad', '50', 'silliness', 'consider', 'Alchemists', 'longed', 'secret', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'alchemists', 'try', 'turn', 'rock', 'brass', 'tin', 'gold', 'also', 'sought', 'out', 'mystery', 'eternal', 'youth', 'brain', 'age', 'body', 'body', 'merely', 'grow', 'old', 'die', 'leaving', 'totally', 'capable', 'sufficient', 'brain', 'die', 'Could', 'brain', 'hundred', 'year', 'old', 'person', 'be', 'placed', 'body', 'teenager', 'continue', 'living', 'course', 'only', 'technology', 'could', 'catch', 'up', 'man', 'dream', 'eternal', 'youth.Ultimately', 'movie', 'serious', 'message', 'females', ""'re"", 'never', 'good', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'man', 'Let', 'face', 'mean', 'look', 'are', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'never', 'will', 'be', 'Men', 'want', 'beautiful', 'women', 'not', 'are', 'not', 'satisfied', 'body', 'woman', 'Oh', 'what', 'better', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'women', 'brains', 'could', 'be', 'placed', 'body', 'chosen', 'man', 'specifications', 'mind', 'Maybe', 'then', ""'d"", 'rather', 'talk', 'spend', 'time', 'instead', 'watching', 'ESPN.And', 'what', 'monster', 'thing', 'closet', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'even', 'average', 'ignoramus', 'creature', 'God', 'right', 'Man', 'was', 'not', 'meant', 'know', 'such', 'things', 'when', 'make', 'even', 'small', 'break', 'God', 'right', 'back', 'place', 'world', 'flat-chested', 'overweight', 'thunder-thighed', 'women', 'Why', 'Beats', 'not', 'know', 'question', 'must', 'serve', 'purpose', 'are', 'here', 'probably', 'something', 'do', 'alcohol', 'industry', 'mean', 'men', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'drink', 'gallons', 'beer', 'women', 'were', 'beautiful', 'right']",N/A

Having said that, I doubt I would want behind-the-scenes pictures if they include a topless stripper as one reviewer remarked.  It is also noted that this version has 20 minutes of footage never before seen on video.  I find this puzzling.  The running time is still 90 minutes and other editions, even older ones come close or match this.  My version from Alpha Video is noticeably shorter at 82 minutes, but that is only 8 minutes shy of this new version.  Bris/K-Tel International released it at 90 minutes and Gotham at 89 minutes.  Madacy even puts it out as a double-feature with the BEAST FROM THE HAUNTED CAVE.  The extra 20 minutes business does not jive.  People on a budget would really have to think about whether superior sound and Letterbox would be worth paying 2 or 3 times the price of cheaper versions.As for the film itself, it is NOT the movie I remember from Creature Feature television.  I had not imagined that a film produced in 1962 could be as crude in taste and lewd regarding women.  All that had been cut out for the kids.  There is no nudity as such, but buxom women scantily clothed leave little to the imagination.  There is even a cat fight in the film.  Combined with the gore violence (dismemberment), I found the film quite unpleasant to watch.As a kid, I thought the talking head on the table was cool.  As an adult, I am dismayed at the callous way her boyfriend treated her and others.  The plot is simple.  Dr. Cortner (Herb Evers) has discovered a way to make transplants of any part of the body.  After a speeding accident he causes, his girl friend is decapitated and he goes in search of a woman he can kill to replace her body.  Ultimately, because of his girl friend's increased mental powers and a freakish accident that he keeps imprisoned in a closet, this not-so-good doctor will get what's coming to him.>No nudity but sexual inuendo and immodest dress and gestures.>Gore and horrific plot violence.>Lack of respect toward women.I cannot reccomend this film.This film could have been a good commentary on the dangers of unbridaled science and/or a false compassion that objectifies human beings for the sake of some hypothetical greater good.

""The Head That Wouldn't Die"", which is the better title because, after all, we are talking an entire head not just a brain) is one of the classics in that particular category. You can get a hold of this film hosted by Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, or skewered by the ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" crew, but you will have no problem appreciating this example of bad science fiction cinema. This is a movie that should be on every fan's list of the 10 Worst Science Fiction Movies Ever Made.Dr. Bill Cortner (Jason call me Herb Evers) is unhappy with the outdated surgery practice by his father, Dr. Cortner (Bruce Brighton), who warns him about higher laws and other nonsense. Bill has a fianc&eacute;, Jan Compton (Virginia Leith), who keeps talking about how she cannot wait for them to get married. So when they are in a car accident he rescues Jan's head and takes it back to his private laboratory. There his assistant, Kurt (Leslie Daniels), who has a transplanted arm that has not exactly taken from one of Bill's earlier experiments and who also rails against the doctor's plan to find his fianc&eacute; (now the infamous ""Jan in a Pan"") the perfect body. Bill only has 48-50 hours (you have to love the specificity) to come up with a new body and heads for the nearest strip club. When that does not pan out (hehehehe) he starts stalking women on the street and finds his way to a Beautiful Body contest. But Bill will accept nothing less than the best for Jan and that ends up being Playboy Playmate of the Month for June 1959, Marilyn Hanold.Meanwhile, Jan would rather be dead than be a detached head; besides, she has some questions about the soundness of the whole procedure, which she discusses with Kurt. The rest of the time she carries on a one sided conversation with whatever is on the other side of the bolted door in the basement (Kurt will not let the cat out of the bag, but we know it is pretty bad and that it is another result of Bill's insane desire to play god). In the bloody climax of this film, the situation comes to a head...Oh, you just cannot have too much fun at the expense of this film. Director Joseph Green and producer Rex Carlton came up with the story, and you have to admit that any movie that combines a talking disembodied head, a monster behind a locked door, and exotic dancers is a movie that is going to be made. Green even gets a bit creative with the camera in the car accident sequence. However, the dialogue and the strong sexual subtext are what really stand out for me in this film. It is amazing that the actors could say some of these lines with straight faces, but it is rather surprising that the sexuality of the film could be so overt. It is very easy to read this film being all about lust: Jan is ready to make Bill very happy and when he is left with just her head he insists on getting what is clearly an even better body so that they can consummate their destiny.I will go out on a limb...and say that ""The Head That Wouldn't Die"" is one of the two worst Science Fiction movies that you have to see, along with ""Plan 9 From Outer Space.""

156934,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,0792846699,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[3, 4]","The plot to this movie sounds humorous, and it kind of all goes downhill from there.  However, this movie has some redeeming moments.Dr. Bill Cortner (a fixture on television for four decades) has a great life.  He has a fast car, a thriving medical practice and hot girl friend Jan Compton (Virginia Leith, whose career went downhill quickly after this movie - perhaps she should have quit while she was a head, or before she was one).  How quickly life can turn tragic in horror movies, both for the actors and for the audience.  While driving his fast car with his girlfriend - neither of whom was wearing a seatbelt (it was the early 60's) - Dr. Cortner loses control of his car and his girlfriend dies.As many fans of horror and science fiction films know, there are many degrees of dead.  In this movie, Dr. Cortner has a process for sustaining life in a head, which he uses on his girlfriend while seeking a new body for her.This movie degenerates rapidly from here.  Dr. Cortner begins visiting sleazy bars and tracking down beautiful women to find a suitable body for his girlfriend.  The seeking of the body seemed to be an excuse for showing scenes which might have been risqu&eacute; in 1962, but are now often tedious.  Other than seeing what people thought was risqu&eacute; in 1962, these scenes add little to the movie.While Dr. Cortner is out gawking at bodies, Jan in the Pan is talking with the Thing in the Closet (I know, I usually explain stuff like this, but maybe you should find out more about this one yourself).  Jan is having psychotic episodes (who wouldn't, being a head in a pan that looks suitable for doing oil changes?) and developing a rapport with the Thing in the Closet.  You know that no good will come of this.Before I forget I have to mention Dr. Cortner's assistant with the shriveled hand.  The hand looks like something I would have created with stuff you find around the house.  I could see why his assistant was upset with his hand; even Frankenstein's monster had a better hand, even if it did come from a dead guy.This movie probably made rounds as the third feature at drive-ins in the early 60's.  This movie has appeared on television, though with the supposedly risqu&eacute; elements and the violence partially removed.  This movie is one of those that you either find hilarious, particularly if you are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, or you thought it was tedious, awful and campy.In spite of the campy moments in this film, Jan in the Pan was done reasonably well.

When his girlfriend dies in a car wreck that he caused, the guilt ridden plastic surgeon Dr.Cortner saves her head (her body burned up) and takes it to his secret lab. There he attaches tubes etc. to it and feeds it the secret formula he has made and keeps it alive much to the chagrin of his assistant who has a withered arm. The head (Virginia Leith) begins telepathically communicating with a ""thing"" kept locked in a closet (a failed experiment) also to the assistant's aggravation. Meanwhile, the doctor has promised her a new body so he sets out to find one. But Leith just wants to die so she plots revenge with the ""thing"". Dr.Cortner goes to a sleazy ""body beautiful"" contest, then an even sleazier strip club where two strippers get in a catfight over him (a memorable sequence) and finally to a figure model. She has the right bod but a scar on her face he promises to fix. Meanwhile, the assistant has had it so he begins taunting the ""thing"" until it reaches out and rips the good arm off of him! The doc brings the model home and drugs her. But before he can he can get started with the surgery, the head compels the ""thing"" to break out of the closet and chew the doc's neck apart (yes, we're talking b&w gore here as with the arm business) and it carries the model to safety when a fire breaks out. At last the head has found peace. Now, what we have here is a film with a budget so low a roach couldn't crawl under it. But, oddly enough, it works and is the textbook example of ""guilty pleasure"". The acting is nil however Leith gives her role an uncomfortable edge by actually being believable (as far as disembodied heads go) and her telecommunication with the ""thing"" is well done. It knocks back at her when it understands. Kind've creepy. This is a ""sleaze"" movie nonetheless but it has an endearing quality to it that makes it enjoyable. Much thanks to Synapse for restoring it so well on DVD. Leith was a rising starlet just three years before this was made having starred with Robert Wagner in ""A Kiss Before Dying"" and other films.

The first is that it becomes a tedious chore to wade through or it becomes a fascinating exercise in the guilty pleasures of trolling through wretched but fun bottom feeders. In THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE, the viewer tends to see it in the second category. The plot is your standard B-fare of a mad doctor seeking a suitably sexy female body to house the head of his fiance who lost hers in a car accident. The actors are the usual nameless lot except for Marylin Hanold, the June 1959 Playboy Playmate who had a bit part as a beauty contest contestant. Adele Lamont has the thankless role as Doris, who plays the beautifully bodied but facially scarred nude model whose body the doctor (Herb Evers) wants to attach to the debodied but loquacious fiance (Virginia Leith). Then there is the monster behind the door played by the real life acromegalic Eddie Carmel.  One is not supposed to nitpick over the plot holes that are wide enough to drive a tank through. One sits back and watches in a weirdly fascinating stupor how camp and horror fuse into a cinematic mess that is no less fun for that. The highlight is not the predictable fire that burns down the mad doctor's lab but the catfight between a pair of busty strippers about who will win the favors of the good doctor. THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE is the textbook example of how a director can use a shoestring budget to shoot a film that has a great deal more to say about the inanity of mixing deep rooted horror with farce than many other higher budgeted movies that flopped miserably on every level imaginable.

This is worth having for the boys and the robots tearing up the film. However, the flip side of that DVD, presenting the movie itself (without the MST3K treatment)comes from a well worn print (although the transfer itself is pretty good)Then there is Madacy's ""Creature Feature"" double feature discs. That series is hit or miss with the transfers never being above average. In the case of thier transfer of this film, it was below average. It was fuzzy and the contrast was low. Get that only if you want the second feature ""Beast From Haunted Cave"", that transfer is fairly okay.Then there are a couple more releases I haven't seen (public domian movies like these really get around).This DVD has a pretty clean transfer that is slightly windowboxed. That is, black bars surround the image. Most of you might not see those bars though, since they are mostly swollowed up by your monitor's overscan (the edges of the picture that are covered by the rim of the TV frame). But it's nice that the unseen areas of this image are mostly black instead of picture.To round out the great transfer is the original trailer and a photo gallery which actually shows a bare breasted dancer in one.As for the movie itself, it's was one of those films I watched wide eyed on 1970's Saturday afternoon/evenings ""Frightening Flickers"" (that's what they called it in my town). It was a movie that eventually merged in my mind with another disembodied head movie called ""The Frozen Dead"". It took seeing the movies again to realize I had remembered details from both movies thinking it was one.Although I don't remember exactly, I'm sure it was edited down from the version you'll see on this DVD. I'm sure I'd remember some of the gorier scenes had I saw them.Now of course, the movie is a pure riot. Although not as inept as an Ed Wood movie it still had it's moments of unintentional hilarity and awkward dialog. Like when a father commented to his son and his fiance that when they get married it won't be as fun to watch (!).But by far, the most unintentionally hilarious scene has to be one which they intended to be horrifying. A character gets his arm ripped off by an unseen monster.For what seems to be forever, he staggers around bumping into the walls with his stump, smearing blood all over the place (it's not hard to see that he really has his arm tucked inside his clothes). He stumbles upstairs, can't use the phone, can't open the door, stumbles back downstairs and staggers, bumps into things and twitches some more, then finally dies.The movie is pretty misogynist too. One scene has these strippers fighting over a doctor, when it comes to blows, they cut to a painting of a cat, complete with a ""meow"" on the sountrack.It's an essential part of any bad movie collection.

I figured that I would buy this film on it's own and check it out. While I can't say that the film is excellent, I do have to give it four stars for its ability to throw something different your way.The story revolves around an experimental doctor who feels that he can either create new body parts and/or creatures. When his fiancee is tragically decapitated in an accident, the doctor is so distraught that he chooses to keep her head alive in some sort of pool of liquid and hooked up to numerous wires and things that buzz.

Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""","[5, 5]","THIS talking head actually has something worthwhile to say... and she can also back up her words with the big nasty monster housed in the nearby closet!This one is all about a (mad) doctor who has learned how to transplant a head, or at least he's ready to try. He has an assistant back at his country house laboratory with a somewhat diminutive personality who is much surprised when the doc staggers in through the door with his fianc&eacute;'s head wrapped in his sports jacket! This was the result of a car crash on the drive to the country house -- the poor gal was decapitated.Sometime prior to this event, the mad doctor had been experimenting around, sewing together various body parts (stolen from corpses at the hospital) and eventually creating an entire corpse which the doc energized to bring it to life. Unfortunately, this Frankenstein reject turned out to be badly flawed and, as the composite monster is as mean as the dickens, he's kept locked away in the laboratory closet.Since the mad doctor has no body for his fianc&eacute; (I think the old one was supposed to have burned up in the car fire), he has to go out scouting around for one but first he brings the head back to life via a bunch of wires, tubes, electronic equipment, and a pan of life juice of some sort  in which the head is strategically placed and propped up.That task being completed, the mad doctor starts hitting the sleazy bars, looking up old flames and, he even attends a beauty contest in a determined effort to find an awesome young body for his lady. Unfortunately, while the doc is out, the fianc&eacute;'s head wakes up and, for reasons unexplained, has unexpectedly developed telepathic abilities (which is lucky because the assistant gets tired of hearing her complaints and tapes her mouth shut!). Thus she communicates with the closet monster who is also really angry with the mad doctor and apparently, both freaks want nothing more than to die... but they have a little revenge in mind first.I'll stop right there to avoid any major spoilers but you can pretty much guess where this one is going.As to the technical aspects of this 1962 movie (actually, it was filmed in '59), it's shot in black-and-white and runs for 82 minutes (this is the superior ""uncut"" version, which includes the doctor's assistant staggering around for two minutes with an arm ripped away, the blood making big snail-trails everywhere). The aspect ratio is a little unique on this one -- it's 1.66:1 and is not your typical widescreen or letterbox. It has a thin border on all four sides so it looks like a regular full-frame on my widescreen TV but if you look closely, you can see the borders. It was filmed in Tarrytown, NY.The packaging from Synapse Films is exceptionally nice on this DVD (with terrific and detailed liner notes by Bryan Senn) and the print is very good, much better than this one:The Brain That Wouldn't Die, or this one:AMC Monsterfest Collection - Cult Classics, Vol. 1 (The Atomic Brain / The Brain That Wouldn't Die / Carnival of Souls / Night Tide). That last one (on two discs in one package) is definitely the inferior choice of the 3, but of course you can obtain it really cheap and you also get the three other horror films as a bonus.Do I like this film? Yes, very much! While it is clearly a B-movie and very low-budget as well, Director Joseph Green still did a superb job with what he had to work with. For example, if you watch VERY closely you can detect that they really didn't wreck the car (a cherry '59 Mercury convertible!) and the quick flash of the car door with the smashed glass was no doubt a junkyard one.In summary, I would highly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates  the older horror flicks.

The girlfriend of Dr. Bill Cortner, a radical experimental surgeon, suffers decapitation in an auto accident. Using his dark science, Dr. Bill keeps her head alive, propped up in a pan and connected to tubes and IVs. The raspy-voiced Head laments its fate with the bleat, &quot;Let me die!&quot; Dr. Bill eventually covers the yakking mouth with surgical tape to silence the whining, a great moment in our little story. Across the room, the monstrous product of a previous failed experiment pounds on the heavy door of its cell, and plots revenge with The Head. They both want, er, a piece of Dr. Bill. Dr. Bill goes out looking for a perfect female body, upon which to implant The Head. This is an excuse for leering scenes of strippers, poverty-row beauty contestants, and a briefly clad model posing for photographers. '50s soft-core titillation. (Note: the flick is variously dated as 1959, 1960, and 1962. Who knows?). The mood music is a sleazy jazz piece with an edge called &quot;The Web&quot; that helps the viewer endure the skid row sideshow. Various edited versions of the film exist, but the one with the wrestling middle-aged hookers, fighting for Dr. Bill's attention, is the funniest. If the women only knew what he really wanted! The Head cogently summarizes the entire flick by pontificating, &quot;Like all quantities, horror has its ultimate, and I am that!&quot; We couldn't agree more.

156955,A2JVR4P3BPDWNK,0792846699,"The Queen of Noirs ""I'm no stinkin' princess""","[4, 5]","One of the best of the head-in-a-box genre (see also ""The Head"" (1959) Victor Trivas, dir; ""The Frozen Dead"" (1966) starring Dana Andrews) this particular movie is enlivened by the relentless saxophone score and the notion of a man out shopping for bodies for his decapitated fiancee at strip clubs. Hey! Might as well have the best!The story is straightforward and stupid: a car crash decapitates the fiancee, so of course the only rational response to this predicament is to keep her head alive in a box in the basement. Why couldn't he keep her body alive, too, then just stitch them back together? Well, the scientist boyfriend must have lost his head because he didn't think about this course of action. Or many he was thinking with his little head and seized the opportunity to create a more bodilicious girlfriend with some cut and paste action!Anyway, the girlfriend gets jealous...watch out for a woman scorned! ""No baby, it's not like that. I was at the strip club looking for new bodies for you!"" Yeah right try that out around MY house and see what happens. Anyway, the plan goes awry and the nasty humanoid critter gets out of the closet (Ohhh I'm in a cold sweat over that one) and the movie finally ends. And not with the expected bang, either.Fabulous hideous terrible schlock.
