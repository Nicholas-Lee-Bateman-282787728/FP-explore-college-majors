The drama has been greatly enhanced by several developments in the plot and characterization.First, Michael J. Fox has been added to the cast.  He doesn't have a big role but when he is on, he is great.  He is a lawyer who will do anything to win his case, including using his significant physical disabilities in order to win the jury's sympathy and understanding. He tries to lure Alicia into his firm and I can see that becoming a real viability for season three. One thing he can do is an incredible job at winning his case during the day and then putting it away at night when he turns to his long term marriage and family.  This no other character on the show can manage to achieve, especially Alicia.Alicia's husband has been kind of the bad guy throughout whereas her old boyfriend, now law boss, has been seen as the good guy.  These lines have been considerably blurred this season.  There is an element of ruthlessness to both men this season. However, Chris Noth as the husband, comes across as untrustworthy in every frame.  You do not grow to like him.  Ironically, this is a change for Noth who more familiarly played the ""good cop"" on shows such as Law & Order.The very best though are the characters of Alicia and her best friend, her firm's detective. There is a terrific crescendo which builds in the second season which involves both of them and the potential to make them enemies instead.  I can't say more because this is something you want to watch develop on your own.Eli is becoming a favorite of mine too and he is especially great this season when he is attracted to a new character, the former star of UGLY BETTY. Slowly you begin to see Eli like and respect Alicia a lot more than his political client, her husband.  Alicia and Eli have come a long way together without becoming love interests.Everyone else does a great job too but I have outlined my favorite characters and developments in the show.",5,Even Better Than First Season,1304812800,"05 8, 2011",2011,2012,"['become', 'one', 'top', 'ten', 'shows', 'tv', 'look', 'forward', 'week', 'drama', 'been', 'greatly', 'enhanced', 'several', 'developments', 'plot', 'characterization.First', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'been', 'added', 'cast', ""n't"", 'have', 'big', 'role', 'when', 'great', 'lawyer', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'win', 'case', 'including', 'using', 'significant', 'physical', 'disabilities', 'order', 'win', 'jury', 'sympathy', 'understanding', 'lure', 'Alicia', 'firm', 'can', 'see', 'becoming', 'real', 'viability', 'season', 'three', 'One', 'thing', 'can', 'do', 'incredible', 'job', 'winning', 'case', 'day', 'then', 'putting', 'away', 'night', 'when', 'long', 'term', 'marriage', 'family', 'other', 'character', 'show', 'can', 'manage', 'achieve', 'especially', 'Alicia.Alicia', 'husband', 'been', 'kind', 'bad', 'guy', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'now', 'law', 'boss', 'been', 'seen', 'good', 'guy', 'lines', 'have', 'been', 'considerably', 'blurred', 'season', 'element', 'ruthlessness', 'men', 'season', 'However', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'husband', 'untrustworthy', 'frame', 'do', 'not', 'grow', 'like', 'Ironically', 'change', 'Noth', 'who', 'more', 'familiarly', 'played', 'good', 'cop', 'shows', 'such', 'Law', 'Order.The', 'very', 'best', 'though', 'are', 'characters', 'Alicia', 'best', 'friend', 'firm', 'detective', 'terrific', 'crescendo', 'second', 'season', 'potential', 'make', 'enemies', 'instead', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'something', 'want', 'watch', 'develop', 'own.Eli', 'becoming', 'favorite', 'mine', 'too', 'especially', 'great', 'season', 'when', 'attracted', 'new', 'character', 'former', 'star', 'UGLY', 'BETTY', 'Slowly', 'begin', 'see', 'Eli', 'respect', 'Alicia', 'lot', 'more', 'political', 'client', 'husband', 'Alicia', 'Eli', 'have', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'together', 'becoming', 'love', 'interests.Everyone', 'else', 'great', 'job', 'too', 'have', 'outlined', 'favorite', 'characters', 'developments', 'show']",N/A

The introduction of political celebrities is interesting but seems somehow &#34;attention-seeking&#34;. The character of &#34;Jackie&#34; (played by Mary Beth Peil) is evolving in an interesting way, or at least being revealed more. I dislike her, as she strikes the pose of Republican-type snobbery. The introduction of the characters &#34;Eli Gold&#34; (played by the diverse Alan Cumming) and &#34;David Lee&#34; (played by Zach Griener) are wonderful!  &#34;David Lee&#34; is absolutely hysterical, though not purposefully!  Christine Baranski as &#34;Diane Lockhart&#34; is fabulous! Her role seems expanded in this season. The more scenes she is in the better! Her style is different from the other attorneys, which is awesome. I did not find all the court cases as interesting this season. Seeing more & more of Archie Panjabi, (playing &#34;Kalinda Shama&#34;) is fascinating, as you learn she holds such mystery, but maintains this penetrating  presence, great abilities, super investigative skills, using what she has as a woman, a woman of color & her innate attractiveness.  &#34;Cary Agos&#34; (played by Matt Czuchry) is a conundrum.  I always see him as a &#34;snake in the grass&#34;, but he turns constantly. Whose side is he really on? I am never quite sure if he will do the right thing or stab people in the back. The complexities in the characters is a lot to absorb. Thought provoking none-the-less.

1350338,A37MH7ICH80QOX,B003L77G10,Kate McMurry,"[101, 107]","WARNING: This review contains spoilers for Season 1. If you have not watched it, please don't read this review.This DVD set is for Season 2 of the award-winning legal drama, The Good Wife, starring Julianna Margulies  as Alicia Florrick, the ""good wife"" of the title of the series. I'll try not to repeat myself too much from the review I previously posted on Amazon for Season 1 which is located here: http://www.amazon.com/review/RBHXRDL3D0W5C/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN;=B003FSTN52&nodeID;=130&tag;=&linkCode;=#wasThisHelpful.A summary of the main events of Season 1 are as follows: Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) is publicly humiliated as the ""good wife"" of a cheating politician, Peter Florrick (Chris Noth). What makes it even worse for Alicia's situation is the fact that for years she sacrificed her own legal career on behalf of her disloyal husband. Soon after Peter's relationship with a hooker is exposed to the world and he resigns in disgrace, he is thrown in jail for paying for the prostitute with public funds. While Peter is in jail, Alicia gets a job practicing law with the firm of Lockhart & Gardener in an attempt to take over from Peter as the family breadwinner.One of the two main partners at the firm is Will Gardner (Josh Charles), a man Alicia had strong feelings for before her marriage, feelings that Will shared, though they were never officially romantically involved. At Lockhart & Gardener, Alicia is thrown into competition for a permanent job with another, much younger associate, Cary Agos (Matt Czuchry). Cary is extremely competitive, but Alicia is naturally collegial and kind, and it goes totally against the grain for her to try and cut him out. Ultimately, though, Alicia realizes she wants, and financially needs, her job badly enough to push aside her scruples and call on the help of Eli Gold, Peter's cagey political adviser (Alan Cumming). Eli helps Alicia defeat Cary by bringing major business to Will's law firm. This is where we are at the end of Season 1 for this amazing series which was nominated for an Emmy.At the start of Season 2, the firm of Lockhart & Gardener is about to merge with another legal practice, and everyone's job security is threatened. In particular, Kalinda (Archie Panjabi) is no longer the firm's only private investigator, and the new one, Blake Calamar (Scott Porter,Friday Night Lights) has a seedy past and the ethics to go with it.The series continues to have standout performances by the regular cast, and wonderful guest spots by brilliant actors such as Michael J. Fox, who repeats the role he played last season as disabled lawyer Louis Canning, who uses his disability to manipulate juries. Gary Cole (Bill Lumbergh inOffice Space) returns in his role of Season 1 as Kurt McVeigh, a sexy ballistics expert who is the unlikely sometime lover of Will's politically progressive partner, Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski).  Rita Wilson (an outstanding character actress who is married to Tom Hanks) plays hotshot attorney Viola Walsh who sends a fascinating case to Diane. Jerry Stiller (Frank Costanza onSeinfeld) plays a narcoleptic judge. America Ferrera (the star ofUgly Betty) appears as an undocumented-immigrant nanny working for Peter's campaign rival, Wendy Scott-Carr, a role played with just the right twist of apple pie and arsenic by Tony-award winner Anika Noni Rose.This show is on the top of my must-watch list. It never disappoints. The acting is terrific, and the scripts are continually outstanding. Every week there is a great blend of fascinating cases and enthrallingly devious relationships between the members of the talented cast and the wonderful actors brought in as guests to interact with them.

The political angle, which became more prominent in this season, shows all the dirty linen of who is willing to do what to get where, and who suddenly realizes dirty politics makes them feel dirty.

So when I saw the entire series was available for FREE with Amazon Prime, I began watching the series from the beginning. I've been on a marathon watching spree for a couple weeks and have made it through the first three seasons. I'm hooked!The series is well-written, the casting is perfect and the acting performances are believable and cohesive. The storyline covers the personal and professional life of Alicia Florrick, the wife of the former state attorney. Her husband is caught in a political scandal revealing numerous sexual affairs and allegations of corruption in his office. He is imprisoned and Alicia finds herself back in the workplace after 13 years away raising her children. She is hired into the firm by a college acquaintance, Will Gardner. The two have had a history of attraction for each other but focus on their professional work. The series presents numerous legal cases and hurdles handled by the firm all while the backstory of politics (both governmental and office) and romances play out between the characters. The show also injects small bits of humor throughout without compromising the integrity of the drama. I particularly like the show's portrayals of quirky justices. The storyline is fantastic and always has me pining for the next episode. And I hear that the show only gets better from here..",5,Outstanding Series,1382918400,"10 28, 2013",2013,1430,"['had', 'seen', 'periodic', 'episodes', 'series', 'network', 'TV', 'always', 'seemed', 'good', 'show', 'when', 'saw', 'entire', 'series', 'was', 'available', 'FREE', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'began', 'watching', 'series', 'beginning', ""'ve"", 'been', 'marathon', 'watching', 'spree', 'couple', 'weeks', 'have', 'made', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', ""'m"", 'hooked', 'series', 'well-written', 'casting', 'perfect', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'believable', 'cohesive', 'storyline', 'personal', 'professional', 'life', 'Alicia', 'Florrick', 'wife', 'former', 'state', 'attorney', 'husband', 'caught', 'political', 'scandal', 'revealing', 'numerous', 'sexual', 'affairs', 'allegations', 'corruption', 'office', 'imprisoned', 'Alicia', 'back', 'workplace', '13', 'years', 'away', 'raising', 'children', 'hired', 'firm', 'college', 'acquaintance', 'Will', 'Gardner', 'two', 'have', 'had', 'history', 'attraction', 'other', 'focus', 'professional', 'work', 'series', 'numerous', 'legal', 'cases', 'hurdles', 'handled', 'firm', 'backstory', 'politics', 'governmental', 'office', 'romances', 'play', 'out', 'characters', 'show', 'also', 'small', 'bits', 'humor', 'compromising', 'integrity', 'drama', 'particularly', 'show', 'portrayals', 'quirky', 'justices', 'storyline', 'fantastic', 'always', 'pining', 'next', 'episode', 'hear', 'show', 'only', 'better', 'here..']",N/A

1350516,AAEYVYQO0131X,B003L77G10,William Gray,"[0, 0]","Despite its flaws, I highly recommend this show as an entertaining and engaging diversion.  It falls in that ""guility pleasure"" realm of something you enjoy even though you suspect you shouldn't.  Having said that, the show is a cut above many popular television dramas.  It's artful in its own way: more Mad Men than Boston Legal.  The scripting and dialogue of this show are just good enough to let its ensemble of actors shine in their respective roles.Juliana Marguilies as Alicia Florrick stands head and shoulders above the rest of the cast, and rightfully so, as the show centers on the stay-at-home mom who returns to practicing law after her States Attorney husband cheats on her with a hooker and lands in jail accused of criminal corruption.  Juliana/Alicia as actress and character is the heart and soul of this show.  We genuinely care about what's happening to her.  Juliana Marguilies is simply marvelous.Graham Phillips and Mackenzie Vega are appropriately charming as Alicia's teenage children.  Their portrayals ring true, and their path toward adulthood is frequently highlighted in the story lines. Josh Charles as the hard-nosed but charming Will Gardner, Chris Noth as Smarmy but reformed(?) Peter Florrick, Archie Panjabi as the steely and seductive Kalinda Sharma, Christine Baranski as the aloof but inwardly soft-hearted Diane, and cute-as-a-button Matt Czuchry as the relentless and overachieving Cary.As suggested by the contrasting adjectives applied to these characters, they each display both good and bad behaviors, and all seem on some sort of trajectory toward becoming a better, or at least different, person.  That is the essence of The Good Wife and it makes the stories less predictable than they would otherwise be.Alan Cummings, Michael J. Fox, Carrie Preston, and many many other fine actors round out the cast in interesting ways.  Many of the supporting characters are cartoonish, but even these minor characters tend to display the same bifurcated dimension of good and evil impulses.  Again, that's a big part of what makes this show so interesting.This show is not high art.  Its courtroom scenes are legally ludicrous and the plot lines melodramatic, but still it works.  That's what good actors can do.  They make us care about the characters, and so we forget about the details.  We just want to see what's going to happen to them, how will they deal with failure or success, will they give in to their weaknesses or rise above them?  Watch this show for three episodes and then tell me you don't care what happens next.  You will care.  You will want to know.  You will have a great time watching the story unfold.  That's why I give it four stars.",4,Great Actors Make The Difference,1370649600,"06 8, 2013",2013,2698,"['flaws', 'highly', 'recommend', 'show', 'entertaining', 'engaging', 'diversion', 'guility', 'pleasure', 'realm', 'something', 'enjoy', 'even', 'suspect', 'should', ""n't"", 'Having', 'said', 'show', 'cut', 'many', 'popular', 'television', 'dramas', 'artful', 'own', 'way', 'more', 'Mad', 'Men', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'scripting', 'dialogue', 'show', 'are', 'just', 'good', 'enough', 'let', 'ensemble', 'actors', 'shine', 'respective', 'roles.Juliana', 'Marguilies', 'Alicia', 'Florrick', 'head', 'shoulders', 'rest', 'cast', 'rightfully', 'so', 'show', 'centers', 'stay-at-home', 'mom', 'who', 'practicing', 'law', 'States', 'Attorney', 'husband', 'cheats', 'hooker', 'jail', 'accused', 'criminal', 'corruption', 'Juliana/Alicia', 'actress', 'character', 'heart', 'soul', 'show', 'genuinely', 'care', 'what', 'happening', 'Juliana', 'Marguilies', 'simply', 'marvelous.Graham', 'Phillips', 'Mackenzie', 'Vega', 'are', 'appropriately', 'charming', 'Alicia', 'teenage', 'children', 'portrayals', 'ring', 'true', 'path', 'adulthood', 'frequently', 'highlighted', 'story', 'lines', 'Josh', 'Charles', 'hard-nosed', 'charming', 'Will', 'Gardner', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'Smarmy', 'reformed', 'Peter', 'Florrick', 'Archie', 'Panjabi', 'steely', 'seductive', 'Kalinda', 'Sharma', 'Christine', 'Baranski', 'aloof', 'inwardly', 'soft-hearted', 'Diane', 'cute-as-a-button', 'Matt', 'Czuchry', 'relentless', 'overachieving', 'Cary.As', 'suggested', 'contrasting', 'adjectives', 'applied', 'characters', 'display', 'good', 'bad', 'behaviors', 'seem', 'sort', 'trajectory', 'becoming', 'better', 'least', 'different', 'person', 'essence', 'Good', 'Wife', 'stories', 'less', 'predictable', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be.Alan', 'Cummings', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'Carrie', 'Preston', 'many', 'many', 'other', 'fine', 'actors', 'round', 'out', 'cast', 'interesting', 'ways', 'Many', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'cartoonish', 'even', 'minor', 'characters', 'tend', 'display', 'same', 'bifurcated', 'dimension', 'good', 'evil', 'impulses', 'Again', 'big', 'part', 'what', 'show', 'interesting.This', 'show', 'not', 'high', 'art', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'are', 'legally', 'ludicrous', 'plot', 'lines', 'melodramatic', 'still', 'what', 'good', 'actors', 'can', 'do', 'make', 'care', 'characters', 'so', 'forget', 'details', 'just', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'how', 'will', 'deal', 'failure', 'success', 'will', 'give', 'weaknesses', 'rise', 'Watch', 'show', 'three', 'episodes', 'then', 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'next', 'will', 'care', 'will', 'want', 'know', 'will', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'watching', 'story', 'unfold', 'why', 'give', 'four', 'stars']",N/A
