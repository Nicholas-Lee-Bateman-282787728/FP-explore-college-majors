1521349,A2M2PBS2FJKHEP,B006WN5W9S,Balletemane,"[0, 0]",Baryshnikov's name is magic to a ballet enthusiasts but this proved very disapointing.Shorter than anticipated and the dancing and choreography lacked the strength andthe lustre expected from modern dance routines these days.Very much like a rehearsal involving two aging dancers.  One is reminded  that dancershave a short  performing lifespan .  Both artists perform well but do not expect any magichere!,2,Not what you expect from Baryshnikov.,1370649600,"06 8, 2013",2013,406,"['Baryshnikov', 'name', 'magic', 'ballet', 'proved', 'very', 'disapointing.Shorter', 'anticipated', 'dancing', 'choreography', 'lacked', 'strength', 'andthe', 'lustre', 'expected', 'modern', 'dance', 'routines', 'days.Very', 'much', 'rehearsal', 'involving', 'two', 'aging', 'dancers', 'One', 'reminded', 'dancershave', 'short', 'performing', 'lifespan', 'artists', 'perform', 'well', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'magichere']",Place - Mikhail Baryshnikov

1521352,A3TIL1PC2ZE97B,B006WN5W9S,J. M WILINSKY,"[11, 13]","Mats Ek is famous for his seemingly amusing, satirical choreography dealing with a variety of themes, from new approaches to the classics to mundane domestic themes. Mats Ek, himself, doesn't think of his work as satirical or comic, but it is hard for us, his audience, to see it differently. Sometimes, I think he is just pulling our leg; he knows it is funny stuff.(For example, in his Sleeping Beauty, she is taken to the hospital in a tiny car to deliver a baby).In ""Place"" Ek seems to return to a domestic theme(compare this to his ballet, ""Apartment""). It is hard to pin down, but we have a table, rug, and, well, a place. We also have a man and a woman, also items found in an apartment. Exactly what ideas Ek has in mind for this, we may never know.Ek's choreography is very modern and active; you don't have to worry about dancers just standing around looking helpless. They move! It is a modern style of dance, peculiar to Ek. Here, Baryshnikov and Laguna(she can also be seen as Giselle in Ek's Giselle, on DVD) look very comfortable and eager to dance this ballet, and work very well together.This should appeal to fans of modern dance, Mats Ek, Baryshnikov and Laguna.",5,Mats Ek in the groove,1333670400,"04 6, 2012",2012,1181,"['Mats', 'Ek', 'famous', 'seemingly', 'amusing', 'satirical', 'choreography', 'dealing', 'variety', 'themes', 'new', 'approaches', 'classics', 'mundane', 'domestic', 'themes', 'Mats', 'Ek', ""n't"", 'think', 'work', 'as', 'satirical', 'comic', 'hard', 'audience', 'see', 'differently', 'Sometimes', 'think', 'just', 'pulling', 'leg', 'funny', 'stuff', 'example', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'taken', 'hospital', 'tiny', 'car', 'deliver', 'baby', 'Place', 'Ek', 'return', 'domestic', 'theme', 'compare', 'ballet', 'Apartment', 'hard', 'pin', 'down', 'have', 'table', 'rug', 'well', 'place', 'also', 'have', 'man', 'woman', 'also', 'items', 'found', 'apartment', 'Exactly', 'what', 'ideas', 'Ek', 'mind', 'may', 'never', 'know.Ek', 'choreography', 'very', 'modern', 'active', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'dancers', 'just', 'standing', 'around', 'looking', 'helpless', 'move', 'modern', 'style', 'dance', 'peculiar', 'Ek', 'Here', 'Baryshnikov', 'Laguna', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'seen', 'Giselle', 'Ek', 'Giselle', 'DVD', 'look', 'very', 'comfortable', 'eager', 'dance', 'ballet', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'together.This', 'should', 'appeal', 'fans', 'modern', 'dance', 'Mats', 'Ek', 'Baryshnikov', 'Laguna']",Place - Mikhail Baryshnikov

I won't even pretend to figure out what the story was about, but it was fun to see Baryshnikov in a setting that was completely outside his genre.It's not as much fun as his works with Twyla Tharp.  At least those works make sense.I would say, if you can get it from a library first, you'll make a better decision as to whether it's a piece you want to own.",3,Unusual ballet - Totally Maks Ek; Add a star if you adore Baryshnikov,1360713600,"02 13, 2013",2013,578,"['lean', 'traditional', 'classical', 'ballet', 'bought', 'wanted', 'see', 'anything', 'more', 'recent', 'showcased', '34', 'Misha.', '34', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'Mats', 'Ek', 'work', 'know', 'ideas', 'are', 'um', 'unconventional', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'pretend', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'story', 'was', 'about', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'Baryshnikov', 'setting', 'was', 'completely', 'genre.It', 'not', 'much', 'fun', 'works', 'Twyla', 'Tharp', 'least', 'works', 'make', 'sense.I', 'would', 'say', 'can', 'get', 'library', 'first', ""'ll"", 'make', 'better', 'decision', 'piece', 'want', 'own']",Place - Mikhail Baryshnikov
