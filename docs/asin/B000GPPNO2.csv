1006066,A20IIR0422G3A5,B000GPPNO2,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[0, 0]","I did not view ""St. Elsewhere"" when it first ran from 1982 - 1988, perhaps because that was the period when I was usually at work 12 hours a day (most especially in 1982), although I recall being aware of it and its principal leads, Ed Flanders, Norman Lloyd, and William Daniels, and I recall hearing of Denzel Washington's leaving the show at its conclusion to a big career in film. In this first season, Washington has a small role near the end of the season. The major players in story arcs for the first season are Ed Begley Jr., David Morse, Howie Mandel, Terence Knox, and Kim Miyori (who is not even in the main credits.)The glory of the series was this huge cast, and a list of future great guest stars such as Tim Robbins and Tom Hulce, before Robbins went on to ""Top Gun"" and even bigger roles and Hulce went on to an Academy Award nomination for his role in Amadeus. The big cast meant you could have a wide variety of characters every week. Ed Begley was smart, but awkward and nave with the demanding head of surgery (Daniels). David Morse was a good, contentious doctor, who stretched himself too thin. Terence Knox was an average resident, who could not deal with his family life. Howie Mandel was an excellent resident in the ER, but inconsiderate of his fellow doctors.One character which deserves a lot of credit is the fictional hospital after which the series is named. It always stands as a Cinderella to the famous ""Boston General"", a fictionalization of ""Massachusetts General"" in Boston. I can't help thinking that just a little inspiration for the series came from the film ""The Hospital"" which also takes place in an older center city hospital. The exterior and the look of the corridors exude age.Perhaps one of the best things about the series is that it is the ""anti-House"". People get punished for breaking rules and going off on their own way of doing things. At the same time, there are no genius doctors. The three senior staff members, played by Flanders, Lloyd, and Craig are very good, perhaps some of the best in Boston, but they are no Gregory House. We see the reality of the way things work in hospitals.I would not say there are any supremely great episodes in Season 1, but the level of storytelling, the interlocking arcs, is consistently high, and things hang together better than they did in ""Hill Street Blues"" which ran at about the same time.",5,Catching up with a classic show.,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,2391,"['did', 'not', 'view', 'St', 'Elsewhere', 'when', 'first', 'ran', '1982', '1988', 'perhaps', 'was', 'period', 'when', 'was', 'usually', 'work', '12', 'hours', 'day', 'most', 'especially', '1982', 'recall', 'being', 'aware', 'principal', 'leads', 'Ed', 'Flanders', 'Norman', 'Lloyd', 'William', 'Daniels', 'recall', 'hearing', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'leaving', 'show', 'conclusion', 'big', 'career', 'film', 'first', 'season', 'Washington', 'small', 'role', 'end', 'season', 'major', 'players', 'story', 'arcs', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'Jr.', 'David', 'Morse', 'Howie', 'Mandel', 'Terence', 'Knox', 'Kim', 'Miyori', 'who', 'not', 'even', 'main', 'credits', 'glory', 'series', 'was', 'huge', 'cast', 'list', 'future', 'great', 'guest', 'stars', 'such', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'Robbins', 'went', 'Top', 'Gun', 'even', 'bigger', 'roles', 'Hulce', 'went', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'role', 'Amadeus', 'big', 'cast', 'meant', 'could', 'have', 'wide', 'variety', 'characters', 'week', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'was', 'smart', 'awkward', 'nave', 'demanding', 'head', 'surgery', 'Daniels', 'David', 'Morse', 'was', 'good', 'contentious', 'doctor', 'who', 'stretched', 'too', 'thin', 'Terence', 'Knox', 'was', 'average', 'resident', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'deal', 'family', 'life', 'Howie', 'Mandel', 'was', 'excellent', 'resident', 'ER', 'inconsiderate', 'fellow', 'doctors.One', 'character', 'lot', 'credit', 'fictional', 'hospital', 'series', 'named', 'always', 'Cinderella', 'famous', 'Boston', 'General', 'fictionalization', 'Massachusetts', 'General', 'Boston', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'just', 'little', 'inspiration', 'series', 'came', 'film', 'Hospital', 'also', 'place', 'older', 'center', 'city', 'hospital', 'exterior', 'look', 'corridors', 'exude', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'series', 'anti-House', 'People', 'get', 'punished', 'breaking', 'rules', 'going', 'off', 'own', 'way', 'doing', 'things', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'genius', 'doctors', 'three', 'senior', 'staff', 'members', 'played', 'Flanders', 'Lloyd', 'Craig', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'perhaps', 'best', 'Boston', 'are', 'Gregory', 'House', 'see', 'reality', 'way', 'things', 'work', 'hospitals.I', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'are', 'supremely', 'great', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'level', 'storytelling', 'interlocking', 'arcs', 'consistently', 'high', 'things', 'hang', 'together', 'better', 'did', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'ran', 'same', 'time']",St. Elsewhere - Season 1
1006067,A17W36X7XYEG0N,B000GPPNO2,"Bookworm ""Pandora""","[9, 11]","Just got finished with the first half of St. Elsewhere and I have to say now I understand all the hoopla surrounding it. I was just a kid when this first aired and I missed all the episodes, but can remember the familiar opening soundtrack when my parents used to turn it on. Now I'm playing catch up. Having watched ER faithfully over the years, I thought I would be disappointed by such an outdated medical drama. But I was wrong. After the first episode, I was hooked. It was a refreshing change to the graphic and violent shows on the tube today. The acting is top notch not to mention fun to watch, Denzel and Howie before they became household names and story lines are revelant and just as gripping as those on ER. I especially like the Dr. Morrison character who reminds me of Dr. Green on the latter, the compassionate and steadfast doctor who puts his patients first. It's comparable to ER's portrayal of harried residents who don't get much sleep and have to choose between work and family, much like the Dr. White character who loses his marriage and nearly his soul to his work. I also got a kick out of all the technology available at the time: cluncky computer terminals, enormous EKG machines,the procedures, and all the 80s hair, music, and clothes. Much of what goes on in hospitals isn't sugarcoated here, the episode where Dr. White lies to a grieving family to obtain a needless autopsy tore at me, especially when he says to his boss, ""I just raped that family,"" is heartrending not to mention shocking. Many episodes are laced with black humor but nothing profane or offensive. It's a quality show that deserved the praise it garnered and it's certainly a trip down memory lane to the days when NBC actually aired great shows worth watching.

The creators fused together a number of idiosyncratic characters into a very appealing set of stories, such as the surfer boy (Ed Beegley Jr.) stuck in a Boston hospital who had to accept the authority of the tough as nails head surgeon (William Daniels), to everybody's favorite cut-up (Howie Mandel).  The show launched many careers such as that of Denzel Washington and Mark Harmon, as well as gave well seasoned actors such as Ed Flanders and Norman Lloyd room to showcase their wonderful talents.  The cast changed over the six seasons but the show never seemed to lose its edge, as it continued to develop its characters without turning them into caricatures of themselves, which happened with shows like LA Law.  Brand and Falsey would go onto create other fine shows like Northern Exposure and I'll Fly Away.",5,No where else I would want to be,1173139200,"03 6, 2007",2007,1103,"['Brand', 'Falsey', 'found', 'magic', 'St', 'Elsewhere', 'was', 'arguably', 'most', 'entertaining', 'medical', 'drama', 'series', 'ever', 'created', 'suppose', 'ER', 'fans', 'might', 'argue', 'point', 'was', 'show', 'reinvented', 'medical', 'drama', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Hill', 'St.', 'Blues', 'reinvented', 'police', 'drama', 'creators', 'fused', 'together', 'number', 'idiosyncratic', 'characters', 'very', 'appealing', 'set', 'stories', 'such', 'surfer', 'boy', 'Ed', 'Beegley', 'Jr.', 'stuck', 'Boston', 'hospital', 'who', 'had', 'accept', 'authority', 'tough', 'nails', 'head', 'surgeon', 'William', 'Daniels', 'everybody', 'favorite', 'cut-up', 'Howie', 'Mandel', 'show', 'launched', 'many', 'careers', 'such', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'as', 'well', 'gave', 'well', 'seasoned', 'actors', 'such', 'Ed', 'Flanders', 'Norman', 'Lloyd', 'room', 'showcase', 'wonderful', 'talents', 'cast', 'changed', 'six', 'seasons', 'show', 'never', 'seemed', 'lose', 'edge', 'continued', 'develop', 'characters', 'turning', 'caricatures', 'happened', 'shows', 'LA', 'Law', 'Brand', 'Falsey', 'would', 'go', 'create', 'other', 'fine', 'shows', 'Northern', 'Exposure', ""'ll"", 'Fly', 'Away']",St. Elsewhere - Season 1

1006082,AYS05FEGASUC,B000GPPNO2,Jim Mitchell,"[13, 13]","St. Elsewhere remains my absolute favorite TV show, and it even ranks high among all of the other forms of entertainment that I enjoy, like movies, music and books.  It's the first show I remember watching that achieved a certain level of realism with its characters, and that had  continuing storylines without being a soap opera.  You could watch each episode without having seen previous ones, but you were definitely rewarded if you watched each week.  It was also the first show I remember that wasn't afraid to take risks with its many characters- they weren't perfect people, and sometimes very bad things happened to them.  St. Elsewhere was intelligent but highly entertaining TV, and it (and Hill Street Blues) paved the way for some excellent shows today that maintain similar standards.And so I've waited for a long time for St. Elsewhere to be on DVD.  I'm not disappointed, but the first season is definitely different from later years.  I don't remember much of the first two seasons, but it seems to me that the show hit its stride in year two and peaked in it third and fourth seasons.  The first season is very good, but the characters haven't been developed quite as well as they would later, and its hard to be invested in some of them knowing that they would disappear after the first season with no explanation.  Also, some of the storylines (especially those involving the psychiatric wing of the hospital) seem silly and unrealistic- almost more like something out of a sitcom than from a serious drama.Still, though, this is where it all started and it's clear that the groundwork was being laid for a great show.  Minor details mentioned here will become major storylines later on, and events that impact characters now will play even bigger roles later.  There are many genuinely emotional and dramatic moments, as well as interesting and well-written stories about medical cases and, more importantly, about the personal lives of the employees at St. Eligius.It would have been nice to have more extras, as other reviewers have mentioned, but I'm glad that the first season is fully intact (although it seems like they did substitute some of the songs- that is definitely not Bruce Springsteen singing ""Born to Run"" in the first episode).  It's frustrating that there is no word yet on future seasons, but hopefully sales will be enough that we'll get the complete show in a relatively short period of time.",5,It Only Gets Better From Here,1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,2435,"['St', 'Elsewhere', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'TV', 'show', 'even', 'high', 'other', 'forms', 'entertainment', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'music', 'books', 'first', 'show', 'remember', 'watching', 'achieved', 'certain', 'level', 'realism', 'characters', 'had', 'continuing', 'storylines', 'being', 'soap', 'opera', 'could', 'watch', 'episode', 'having', 'seen', 'previous', 'ones', 'were', 'definitely', 'rewarded', 'watched', 'week', 'was', 'also', 'first', 'show', 'remember', 'was', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'take', 'risks', 'many', 'characters-', 'were', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'people', 'sometimes', 'very', 'bad', 'things', 'happened', 'St', 'Elsewhere', 'was', 'intelligent', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'TV', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'paved', 'way', 'excellent', 'shows', 'today', 'maintain', 'similar', 'standards.And', 'so', ""'ve"", 'waited', 'long', 'time', 'St', 'Elsewhere', 'be', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'not', 'disappointed', 'first', 'season', 'definitely', 'different', 'later', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'much', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'show', 'hit', 'stride', 'year', 'two', 'peaked', 'third', 'fourth', 'seasons', 'first', 'season', 'very', 'good', 'characters', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'developed', 'quite', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'later', 'hard', 'be', 'invested', 'knowing', 'would', 'disappear', 'first', 'season', 'explanation', 'Also', 'storylines', 'especially', 'involving', 'psychiatric', 'wing', 'hospital', 'seem', 'silly', 'unrealistic-', 'almost', 'more', 'something', 'sitcom', 'serious', 'drama.Still', 'though', 'where', 'started', 'clear', 'groundwork', 'was', 'being', 'laid', 'great', 'show', 'Minor', 'details', 'mentioned', 'here', 'will', 'become', 'major', 'storylines', 'later', 'events', 'impact', 'characters', 'now', 'will', 'play', 'even', 'bigger', 'roles', 'later', 'are', 'many', 'genuinely', 'emotional', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'interesting', 'well-written', 'stories', 'medical', 'cases', 'more', 'importantly', 'personal', 'lives', 'employees', 'St.', 'Eligius.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'more', 'extras', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', ""'m"", 'glad', 'first', 'season', 'fully', 'intact', 'did', 'substitute', 'songs-', 'definitely', 'not', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'singing', 'Born', 'Run', 'first', 'episode', 'frustrating', 'word', 'yet', 'future', 'seasons', 'hopefully', 'sales', 'will', 'be', 'enough', ""'ll"", 'get', 'complete', 'show', 'relatively', 'short', 'period', 'time']",St. Elsewhere - Season 1

Could it be as good as I had remembered?The first episode doesn't disappoint, it's a great debut. But then, the writing stalls a bit. A suggestion for new viewers; don't bail out because of the ""tweety and ralph"" storyline, or because of uneven writing in the beginning few episodes. Once things begin to pick up, St. Elsewhere really does rise to meet the high praise it regularly receives. I'm happy to say that after watching season one, my memories of a ""great series"" were in fact correct! Truly one of the best of the 80's, and of all time.I cannot end this review without mentioning the fact that I have never really liked E.R. or Chicago Hope, two series that perhaps owe a great debt to St. Elsewhere. A huge production and ""big names"" (producers, actors) do not always create a superior product. In fact, the simple low key approach taken by St. Elsewhere is what helps it to rise above the more ""produced"" efforts on TV.Give St. Elsewhere a try!

Strong writing, thoughtful acting, inventive direction and camera-work (for the time).  Terrific fun to sit and watch early performances of actors who went on to do more great work (the late Robert Pastorelli, for one) and those who probably should have had better careers than they've had (Lance Guest, for example).What gives this DVD set a 4-star rating instead of a 5-star rating is the sad extras.  On the plus side, St. Elsewhere has closed captioning.  On the negative, there is only one episode with commentary, ""Cora and Arnie.""  And nearly all the other extras deal with this same episode or the arc of stories in which it's included!  It was a great episode and Doris Roberts (who does commentary with Mark Tinker) and the late James Coco were very credible in the title roles.  In fact, they both won well-deserved Emmys.  But there's a lot more to the season than this one episode (#4) and its three or four episode arc.It'd be great to have commentary with William Daniels, Howie Mandel, Ed Begley, Jr., Bonnie Bartlett, etc.  There's one very slight ""Cora and Arnie"" documentary which includes some comments from David Morse, but, again, it'd be great to get some talk from a variety of people on a variety of episodes.I don't mind the double-sided DVD's all that much, and I don't need fancy packaging.  I just want meatier extras, spread out over the entire season.  More behind-the-scenes.  The best DVD episode commentaries are those involving two or more of the cast members.

It's been a long time since I've seen an episode, and I know that dramas in particular don't always hold up well a generation later.

Dramas like HILL STREET BLUES often are more nostalgic than actually still engrossing.I have high hopes for ST. ELSEWHERE because 1) it was head and shoulders above the rest when it aired, 2) it had a brilliant cast...and not just Denzel Washington, David Morse or Alfre Woodard (who all went on to more famous film careers), but pretty much every other person in the show was at the top of their games.I remember how cutting-edge they were, particularly in dealing with AIDS.  First regular TV show I can remember where a patient had AIDS.  And I remember how freaked out everyone was by him.  First show in which a major character (Mark Harmon) died from AIDS.  And remember how there was a rapist running around the hospital as well?  And remember that it turned out to be a major character?  Not many shows will go down that road today.I remember lots of humor, and lots of pathos.  I'm sure it doesn't have the blinding pace of ER...but ER would not have existed without ST. ELSEWHERE.  (And ER's pace isn't always a good thing...sometimes I can't understand what everyone is saying on that show!)  But it told interesting stories, and it had recurring characters you CARED about.  In so many dramas with large casts today...you don't find yourself investing much concern in what happens to the characters...you're just trying to keep up with them all.  ST. ELSEWHERE managed to juggle so many people, and yet they were all flesh and blood.

It was an ensemble piece that still lives up to the reality of the medical hospital.St. Eligius is still remembered as the dumping ground hospital with young, aspiring doctors who work hard and long hours with little sleep. There is plenty of reality here long before it was fashionable. The cast and crew were talented, honest, candid, and above all the best. They were diverse and believable in their roles.

I watched St. Elsewhere growing up and so am very excited to see the release, but I truly hope they release all of the seasons, as it only gets better.I stopped watching ER when they failed to resolve certain plot points over a few years and for the utterly ridiculous plot they concocted to kill off Dr. Romano!Fans of ER who haven't seen St. Elsewhere might find it somewhat slow paced (especially during the emergency scenes...then it seems very slow), but what it lacks in this excitement is made up for in great story development, some good dark humor mixed in and a large and tremendously talented cast. Note a young Denzel Washington as one of the doctors, Howie Mandel (when he still had hair and was doing stand-up) is very funny as Dr. Fiscus,Dr. Craig, the obnoxious and hugely intolerant surgeon with the stereotypical big ego, was one of my favorites and in re-viewing the show, William Daniels' portrayal of the role is fantastically funny. This stereotype re-emerged in ER as the caustic Dr. Romano, who I also couldn't get enough of.It would take another paragraph to comment on the great other main character performances, but the role that Ed Flanders plays as Dr. Westphall is outstanding, very understated and yet very deep. The women doctors on the show deal with sexism and the juggling of career vs. mother which was, and still is, so typical of the times.In order to see the kudos this show has received in the past and after it went off the air, you just have to look at the Wikipedia entry to see it was, and I think still is, very highly regarded.Can't wait for Seasons 2-6!",5,Bring on Season Two!,1192492800,"10 16, 2007",2007,1860,"['only', 'medical', 'drama', 'today', 'standards', 'believe', 'St', 'Elsewhere', 'what', 'ER', 'favorite', 'mine', 'humor', 'real', 'personal', 'stories', 'hospital', 'continuity', 'plot', 'ongoing', 'stories', 'may', 'range', '2', 'episodes', 'watched', 'St', 'Elsewhere', 'growing', 'up', 'so', 'am', 'very', 'excited', 'see', 'release', 'truly', 'hope', 'release', 'seasons', 'only', 'better.I', 'stopped', 'watching', 'ER', 'when', 'failed', 'resolve', 'certain', 'plot', 'points', 'few', 'years', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'concocted', 'kill', 'off', 'Dr.', 'Romano', 'Fans', 'ER', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'St', 'Elsewhere', 'might', 'find', 'somewhat', 'slow', 'paced', 'especially', 'emergency', 'scenes', 'then', 'very', 'slow', 'what', 'excitement', 'made', 'up', 'great', 'story', 'development', 'good', 'dark', 'humor', 'mixed', 'large', 'tremendously', 'talented', 'cast', 'Note', 'young', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'one', 'doctors', 'Howie', 'Mandel', 'when', 'still', 'had', 'hair', 'was', 'doing', 'stand-up', 'very', 'funny', 'Dr.', 'Fiscus', 'Dr', 'Craig', 'obnoxious', 'hugely', 'intolerant', 'surgeon', 'stereotypical', 'big', 'ego', 'was', 'one', 'favorites', 're-viewing', 'show', 'William', 'Daniels', 'portrayal', 'role', 'fantastically', 'funny', 'stereotype', 're-emerged', 'ER', 'caustic', 'Dr.', 'Romano', 'who', 'also', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'of.It', 'would', 'take', 'paragraph', 'comment', 'great', 'other', 'main', 'character', 'performances', 'role', 'Ed', 'Flanders', 'Dr.', 'Westphall', 'outstanding', 'very', 'understated', 'yet', 'very', 'deep', 'women', 'doctors', 'show', 'deal', 'sexism', 'juggling', 'career', 'mother', 'was', 'still', 'so', 'typical', 'times.In', 'order', 'see', 'kudos', 'show', 'received', 'past', 'went', 'air', 'just', 'have', 'look', 'Wikipedia', 'entry', 'see', 'was', 'think', 'still', 'very', 'highly', 'regarded.Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Seasons', '2-6']",St. Elsewhere - Season 1
