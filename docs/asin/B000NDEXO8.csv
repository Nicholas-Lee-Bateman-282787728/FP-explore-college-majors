1056221,AMX6OVOXFDL5Q,B000NDEXO8,Ben Masters,"[1, 1]","This review is of the release of the first full season of this CBS police series, which, according to FOX Home Entertainment and MGM, is ""The True Beginning"" of the series. The series started as a TV movie by that name in 1981, with Loretta Swit (best known for ""M*A*S*H"") as Chris Cagney, and Tyne Daly as her partner, Mary Beth Lacey. ""Cagney & Lacey"" as a series premiered in March 1982 and ran for 6 outings on Thursdays from 9 to 10, with Meg Foster as Chris Cagney (Lacey was unchanged, as Tyne Daly still played that role). The ratings were very low for that 6-outing tryout, and so CBS tried again in the fall, changing to Sharon Gless for the role of Cagney. This time, the series went a full season of 22 outings on Mondays from 10 to 11 (1982-83, the season presented in this release), but ratings were very low over that run, and again the series was cancelled. This prompted an intense hue and cry from loyal viewers, and summer reruns in 1983 drew in new viewers who wanted to see what these remarkable women were like. Finally, CBS brought it back for good in March 1984, and it ran until August 1988.In addition to the title characters, others included Lt. Bert Samuels (the late Canadian Al Waxman), boss of the 14th precinct in NYC where Cagney and Lacey worked; Detectives Petrie, Isbecki, and La Guardia (Carl Lumbly, Martin Kove, and the late Sidney Clute); Lacey's husband Harvey (John Karlen); and their sons Harvey Jr. and Michael (Tony La Torre and Troy Slaten).Here are the 22 outings of this ""True Beginning"" release, as listed on the two slipcases:Disc 1A:""Witness to an Incident""""One of Our Own""""Beauty Burglars""""High Steel""Disc 1B:""Hotline""""Internal Affairs""Disc 2A:""Mr. Lonelyhearts""""Conduct Unbecoming""""I'll Be Home For Christmas""""Recreational Use""Disc 2B:""Hopes and Dreams""""The Grandest Jewel Thief of Them All""Disc 3A:""Affirmative Action""""Open and Shut Case""""Jane Doe #37""""Date Rape""Disc 3B:""Burnout""""Chop Shop""Disc 4A:""Let Them Eat Pretzels""""The Gang's All There""(Featurette: ""Breaking The Laws of TV, Part 1"")Disc 4B:""A Cry For Help""""The Informant""(Featurette: ""Breaking The Laws of TV, Part 2"")The 22 outings of this ""True Beginning"" of ""Cagney & Lacey"" are presented on 4 double-sided discs as listed above; the first 3 have 6 outings apiece (4 on one side, 2 on the other), and the last one has the remaining 4 (2 on each side). The last disc also has a two-part documentary about the series (or at least this first full season's worth of it); each part is on one side of the last disc as listed above. The 22 outings have only English as an audio option, but English and Spanish subtitles are included, as are closed captions. The 4 discs are in 2 slipcases; each slipcase has the same image as the package, but there are episode listings on the other side of each case.In short, this is a fine release of one of television's classic police dramas, and one with two outstanding actresses (at least IMO) in the leads, and therefore one that is worth a purchase, despite the omission of the 6-outing tryout of early '82 with Meg Foster.",5,"""Cagney and Lacey: The True Beginning""",1325462400,"01 2, 2012",2012,3074,"['review', 'release', 'first', 'full', 'season', 'CBS', 'police', 'series', 'according', 'FOX', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'MGM', 'True', 'Beginning', 'series', 'series', 'started', 'TV', 'movie', 'name', '1981', 'Loretta', 'Swit', 'best', 'known', 'M*A*S*H', 'Chris', 'Cagney', 'Tyne', 'Daly', 'partner', 'Mary', 'Beth', 'Lacey', 'Cagney', 'Lacey', 'series', 'premiered', 'March', '1982', 'ran', '6', 'outings', 'Thursdays', '9', '10', 'Meg', 'Foster', 'Chris', 'Cagney', 'Lacey', 'was', 'unchanged', 'Tyne', 'Daly', 'still', 'played', 'role', 'ratings', 'were', 'very', 'low', '6-outing', 'tryout', 'so', 'CBS', 'tried', 'again', 'fall', 'changing', 'Sharon', 'Gless', 'role', 'Cagney', 'time', 'series', 'went', 'full', 'season', '22', 'outings', 'Mondays', '10', '11', '1982-83', 'season', 'presented', 'release', 'ratings', 'were', 'very', 'low', 'run', 'again', 'series', 'was', 'cancelled', 'prompted', 'intense', 'hue', 'cry', 'loyal', 'viewers', 'summer', 'reruns', '1983', 'drew', 'new', 'viewers', 'who', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'remarkable', 'women', 'were', 'like', 'Finally', 'CBS', 'brought', 'back', 'good', 'March', '1984', 'ran', 'August', '1988.In', 'addition', 'title', 'characters', 'others', 'included', 'Lt.', 'Bert', 'Samuels', 'late', 'Canadian', 'Al', 'Waxman', 'boss', '14th', 'precinct', 'NYC', 'where', 'Cagney', 'Lacey', 'worked', 'Detectives', 'Petrie', 'Isbecki', 'La', 'Guardia', 'Carl', 'Lumbly', 'Martin', 'Kove', 'late', 'Sidney', 'Clute', 'Lacey', 'husband', 'Harvey', 'John', 'Karlen', 'sons', 'Harvey', 'Jr.', 'Michael', 'Tony', 'La', 'Torre', 'Troy', 'Slaten', 'are', '22', 'outings', 'True', 'Beginning', 'release', 'listed', 'two', 'slipcases', 'Disc', '1A', 'Witness', 'Incident', 'One', 'Own', 'Beauty', 'Burglars', 'High', 'Steel', '1B', 'Hotline', 'Internal', 'Affairs', '2A', 'Mr.', 'Lonelyhearts', 'Conduct', 'Unbecoming', ""'ll"", 'Be', 'Home', 'Christmas', 'Recreational', 'Use', '2B', 'Dreams', 'Grandest', 'Jewel', 'Thief', 'Them', 'All', 'Disc', '3A', 'Affirmative', 'Action', 'Open', 'Shut', 'Case', 'Jane', 'Doe', '37', 'Date', 'Rape', '3B', 'Chop', 'Shop', '4A', 'Let', 'Them', 'Eat', 'Pretzels', 'Gang', 'Featurette', 'Breaking', 'Laws', 'TV', 'Part', '1', '4B', 'Cry', 'Help', 'Informant', 'Featurette', 'Breaking', 'Laws', 'TV', 'Part', '2', '22', 'outings', 'True', 'Beginning', 'Cagney', 'Lacey', 'are', 'presented', '4', 'double-sided', 'discs', 'listed', 'first', '3', 'have', '6', 'outings', 'apiece', '4', 'one', 'side', '2', 'other', 'last', 'one', 'remaining', '4', '2', 'side', 'last', 'disc', 'also', 'two-part', 'documentary', 'series', 'least', 'first', 'full', 'season', 'worth', 'part', 'one', 'side', 'last', 'disc', 'listed', '22', 'outings', 'have', 'only', 'English', 'audio', 'option', 'English', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'are', 'included', 'are', 'closed', 'captions', '4', 'discs', 'are', '2', 'slipcases', 'slipcase', 'same', 'image', 'package', 'are', 'episode', 'listings', 'other', 'side', 'case.In', 'short', 'fine', 'release', 'one', 'television', 'classic', 'police', 'dramas', 'one', 'two', 'outstanding', 'actresses', 'least', 'IMO', 'leads', 'therefore', 'one', 'purchase', 'omission', '6-outing', 'tryout', 'early', ""'82"", 'Meg', 'Foster']",Cagney & Lacey: Season 1

This set is sadly lacking in both areas.It contains two plain discs in thin plastic holders. Both holders have the same photo and information on the front. Nothing distinguishes case one from case two.Unlike other collectible sets that have colorful plastic discs, these discs are plain, silver colored and non-distinct. It's impossible to tell one disc from the other without a magnifying glass. To make things even worse, the discs are double-sided, so we're issued two instead of four.This garbage is grossly overpriced at $25.99. Even the thrill of watching Cagney and Lacey again hasn't soothed the feeling of being cheated.I'm really shocked and angered that other reviewers haven't taken issue with the cheap dollar store packaging and design. To comment only on the C&L; show, which we all loved or we wouldn't be here, and not on the quality of the item itself defeats the purpose of these reviews. I reply heavily on Amazon's customer review section to make an informed decision before I buy. Many of these reviews were actually written BEFORE the product came onto the market.

This show was unique in that it was the first time that two basically average looking women played the leads in a TV show that was not about the fact that they were just average looking women. The show was also ground-breaking in that both detectives in the partnership were women - smart, capable women. Women had gradually been integrated into TV police forces over the 15 years prior to this series, but prior to this they were usually part of a crime-solving team such as on ""Ironside"". The balance in this show was not through the well-known old cop/young cop formula. Instead, both detectives were 30-something women. The contrast came in the form of their marital status and their personal situations. Lacey was married and a mother, and Cagney was single.Technically, this is not season one of this show. There was a pilot and six episodes during the 1981-1982 season starring an actress other than Sharon Gless as Detective Christine Cagney.

More home life, Lacey buying a house, Cagney's alcoholism, and relationship with her father & boyfriends. None of that is in this set, this is truely the beginning. Pretty straight forward police work, some of Lacey, Harvey and the kids, but not much, and it shows the women's interaction with other officers on the force. I like Sharon Gless as the only Cagney in this set. I could not warm up to the other woman who played the character in the first few episodes, I am glad she is not included.

Hornaday,"[82, 85]","This four-disc set represents the first and long-overdue U.S. DVD release of the landmark police drama Cagney & Lacey.This remarkable series, which dealt with controversial social topics, ended up being quite controversial on its own. It began with a pilot in 1981 starring Loretta Swit and Detective Christine Cagney, and Tyne Daly as her partner, Detective Mary Beth Lacey. When the show debuted as a series the following year on CBS, Cagney was portrayed by Meg Foster while Daly reprised her role. The show suffered poor ratings and Foster only last six episodes. She was replaced by Sharon Gless in the pivotal role of Cagney, while Daly remained in unforgettable portrayal of Lacey. It was widely reported that Foster's portrayal of the very tough Cagney along with Daly as a second woman lead, was making viewers uncomfortable that Cagney might be gay. Officially, the network explained Foster's replacement by saying they feared viewers might have trouble ""telling the two leads apart.""Ratings remained low and the show was cancelled after only one season, but the saga was far from over. An unprecedented outpouring by fans who worked tirelessly to bring the show back on the air was rewarded by its return in 1984. It finally went off the air in 1988 after 125 series episodes, while four reunion movies followed.The 22 of the first season episodes featuring Gless and Daly are on this set, along with a new two-part documentary about the show.Cagney & Lacey redefined gender roles in TV dramas. Now, it hardly seems possible that a series starring two women leads would be a pioneer in overcoming the glass ceiling that prevented women from obtaining untraditional jobs, but it was. While another groundbreaking cop show, Police Woman, starring Angie Dickinson, should also be lauded, it was Cagney & Lacey that went much further in focusing the series spotlight on two professional women, and dealt directly with the sexism that they encountered among the public and within the own New York City police department. Eventually, Cagney was promoted to Detective Sergeant.Through the years, the show also dealt with drug abuse, alcoholism, racism, rape, and balancing a home life while having a successful career. Daly was two win four Best Actress Emmy Awards for her portrayal of Lacey, while Gless won two of the coveted awards for Cagney.The primary cast included Al Waxman as Lt.

The time has come for the government to step in and set down laws for releasing films.  I am tired of paying two, three, and four times to see the same film or tv show.  First it comes out and scenes are missing.  Then it comes out again in a restored version. Then a directors cut.  Then again with lost footage found.  There needs to be a law passed that once a film is released in the theater THAT is the film.  Period.  No changes made.  THIS IS THE SECOND SEASON OF CAGNEY AND LACEY.  The first season started March 25, 1982 with actress MEG FOSTER playing the role of Cagney in the episode called ""You Call this Plain Clothes?"" and ended after six episodes with the final one being ""Better than Equal"".  What this set contains is season 2 which began October 25, 1982 with the episode ""Witness to an Incident"" and with Sharon Gless taking over the role of Detective Cagney.  Why didn't they just start the dvd release with the actual season one?  Why the lie?  Also, what about the original pilot movie for Cagney and Lacey that starred Loretta Swit?  What happened to that?  M*A*S*H* would not let her out of her contract to do the tv series so they got Meg Foster instead.  Why wasn't that included on this set as well?  I can just see them continuing to release this set and then a few years down the line it will be re-released with the original movie and the actual 1st season with Meg Foster  and then viewers will be expected to buy the series all over again.  Something needs to be done about this.  HOW CAN A STUDIO LEGALLY CALL THE SECOND SEASON THE FIRST SEASON?  I don't get it. Also, these are two sided discs which I am not a fan of either.  Two sided discs are usually trouble and seem more prone to damage.  So far I haven't had trouble with any of the discs.  I've watched a few episodes on some of the discs and they played well, but I still don't like two sided discs.  What is nice is that they included the little promo teaser that used to run before each episode.  A lot of dvd releases omit that but they're included here and that is a nice touch.  Also, the Featurette BREAKING THE LAWS OF TV - The Making of Cagney and Lacey was excellent.  Gless and Daly are both in it, along with several other major cast members and key production people recalling episodes and their experiences filming the series.

I know there has been some flack about the pilot movie and the first six episodes with Meg Foster not being released first (or at least included on this set) but I agree with another reviewer who said that releasing Sharon Gless' first season is probably a marketing strategy to determine public interest. Of the three Cagney's, Gless is the most widely associated with the show and therefore, the most marketable. Hopefully sales will be high enough to merit the release of every season, including the pilot film, Foster's episodes and the reunion movies.As far as the DVD set goes, it features great cover art on the box. There are four DVDs inside with episodes on both sides of each DVD (I actually prefer discs where the episodes are all on one side but that's a minor quibble and I'm sure that four discs [as opposed to six] was cheaper to produce). There's also a featurette, ""Breaking the Laws of TV"" which explains C&L;'s evolution. Although it's a great ""extra"", it's broken up into two parts, with one part being on one side of the last disc and the second part being on the flip side. It would be much more convenient to have it all as one feature on one side....but again, another minor quibble.
