As several others have mentioned it is not even remotely the same kind of humor as family guy, it is indeed (as one may guess) nothing but a poorly strung together set of little johnny jokes.  The humor falls flat seeming to depend highly on the concept that swearing is funny.  Because almost all of the jokes the punchline is Johnny swearing.  The thing about little Johnny jokes is they are burn out pretty easily, the more you hear them the less funny they are.  On top of that most of these are jokes you have heard over and over again.  It fizzles and dies pretty quickly.A more appropriate tag line would be: &#34;Old rehashed jokes, nothing at all like &#34;Family Guy&#34;, and much worse&#34;",1,"Sad string of jokes where swearing is the punchline, maybe funny if you are under 10.",1404259200,"07 2, 2014",2014,825,"['34', 'Australia', 'Answer', '34', 'Family', 'Guy', '34', 'Wronger', '34', 'was', 'tag-line', 'Amazon', 'had', 'put', 'movie', 'several', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'not', 'even', 'remotely', 'same', 'kind', 'humor', 'family', 'guy', 'indeed', 'one', 'may', 'guess', 'nothing', 'poorly', 'strung', 'together', 'set', 'little', 'johnny', 'jokes', 'humor', 'flat', 'seeming', 'depend', 'highly', 'concept', 'swearing', 'funny', 'almost', 'jokes', 'punchline', 'Johnny', 'swearing', 'thing', 'little', 'Johnny', 'jokes', 'are', 'burn', 'out', 'pretty', 'easily', 'more', 'hear', 'less', 'funny', 'are', 'top', 'most', 'are', 'jokes', 'have', 'heard', 'over', 'again', 'pretty', 'quickly.A', 'more', 'appropriate', 'tag', 'line', 'would', 'be', '34', 'Old', 'rehashed', 'jokes', 'nothing', '34', 'Family', 'Guy', '34', 'much', 'worse', '34']",Little Johnny the Movie

Even the attempts at being ""offensively funny"" with the minorities portrayed fall so flat on their face that you can't even feel offended.If you have never heard a joke in your life, then this may give you a laugh or two... other than that, this movie is impossible to recommend on any level.",1,A Movie to Avoid,1333411200,"04 3, 2012",2012,775,"['so', 'rare', 'give', 'movie', 'one', 'star', 'review', 'was', 'easily', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'little', 'needs', 'be', 'said', 'basically', 'one', 'jokes', 'recycled', 'old', 'Little', 'Johnny', 'jokes', 'so', ""'ve"", 'heard', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'animation', 'awful', 'was', 'made', ""'70s"", 'plot', 'barely', 'there.I', 'try', 'not', 'be', 'cynic', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'fraction', 'originality', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'Even', 'attempts', 'being', 'offensively', 'funny', 'minorities', 'portrayed', 'fall', 'so', 'flat', 'face', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'feel', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'joke', 'life', 'then', 'may', 'give', 'laugh', 'two', 'other', 'movie', 'impossible', 'recommend', 'level']",Little Johnny the Movie
