874812,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0006VL1J2,,"[6, 6]","The Korean film ""Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War"" stands as one of the most unsparing and harrowing films about men engaged in armed conflict to come our way in many years.""Tae Guk Gi"" shows us the Korean War through the eyes of two brothers, Jin-tae and Jin-seok, both of whom are pulled away from their family and conscripted into the army right at the start of the conflict.  Jin-tae feels very protective of his younger brother and devises a scheme to get himself a medal so that Jin-seok will be able to be sent home.  Thus, Jin-tae begins to volunteer for dangerous assignments, much to Jin-seok's great fear and consternation.  Over time, however, Jin-tae comes to savor his hero status, eventually becoming so desensitized to human suffering that he begins to commit atrocities of his own both on and off the battlefield.  The film raises the issues of what it means to be a ""hero"" and of where loyalty to family as well as to country truly begin and end.Alternately horrifying and heartbreaking, ""Tae Guk Gi"" is a war film done on an epic scale that, nevertheless, rarely loses focus on the intimate human drama at its core - even though the plotting leans a bit towards the artificial and the melodramatic at times (further heightened by a musical score that is far more soupy than it needs to be).  Still, with battle scenes that are every bit as graphic, realistic and unflinching as those in ""Saving Private Ryan,"" the film effectively captures the unrelenting savagery of the ugly business we call war.The performances by Dong-Kun Jang and Bin Won, as the two literal brothers-in-arms, are moving and authentic, and the action scenes have an immediacy and scope that help the film override some of the weaknesses in the script.  Astutely directed by Je-gyu Kang and superbly edited by Kyeong-hie Choi, ""Tae Guk Gi"" is a powerful film about war and the men - be they heroes or common soldiers - called upon to wage it.",4,very powerful war film,1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,1934,"['Korean', 'film', 'Tae', 'Guk', 'Gi', 'Brotherhood', 'War', 'one', 'most', 'unsparing', 'harrowing', 'films', 'men', 'engaged', 'armed', 'conflict', 'come', 'way', 'many', 'years', 'Tae', 'Guk', 'Gi', 'Korean', 'War', 'eyes', 'two', 'brothers', 'Jin-tae', 'Jin-seok', 'whom', 'are', 'pulled', 'away', 'family', 'conscripted', 'army', 'right', 'start', 'conflict', 'Jin-tae', 'feels', 'very', 'protective', 'younger', 'brother', 'scheme', 'get', 'medal', 'Jin-seok', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'be', 'sent', 'home', 'Thus', 'Jin-tae', 'begins', 'volunteer', 'dangerous', 'assignments', 'much', 'Jin-seok', 'great', 'fear', 'consternation', 'time', 'however', 'Jin-tae', 'savor', 'hero', 'status', 'eventually', 'becoming', 'so', 'desensitized', 'human', 'suffering', 'commit', 'atrocities', 'own', 'battlefield', 'film', 'issues', 'what', 'be', 'hero', 'where', 'loyalty', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'country', 'truly', 'begin', 'end.Alternately', 'horrifying', 'heartbreaking', 'Tae', 'Guk', 'Gi', 'war', 'film', 'done', 'epic', 'scale', 'nevertheless', 'rarely', 'focus', 'intimate', 'human', 'drama', 'core', 'even', 'plotting', 'bit', 'artificial', 'melodramatic', 'times', 'further', 'heightened', 'musical', 'score', 'far', 'more', 'soupy', 'be', 'Still', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'bit', 'graphic', 'realistic', 'unflinching', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'film', 'effectively', 'unrelenting', 'savagery', 'ugly', 'business', 'call', 'war.The', 'performances', 'Dong-Kun', 'Jang', 'Bin', 'Won', 'two', 'literal', 'brothers-in-arms', 'are', 'moving', 'authentic', 'action', 'scenes', 'have', 'immediacy', 'scope', 'help', 'film', 'weaknesses', 'script', 'Astutely', 'directed', 'Je-gyu', 'Kang', 'superbly', 'edited', 'Kyeong-hie', 'Choi', 'Tae', 'Guk', 'Gi', 'powerful', 'film', 'war', 'men', 'be', 'heroes', 'common', 'soldiers', 'called', 'wage']",Tae Guk Gi - The Brotherhood of War

874815,AVAHA06K08ZKK,B0006VL1J2,Alwyn Lau,"[5, 6]","""Saving Private Ryan"", starting out magnificiently, fizzled out halfway through. ""We Were Soldiers"", with well-designed battle scenes, had too many characters and may have tried to accomplish too much in too little reel. ""WindTalkers"", so action-packed, came across as overly fantastic at various points. ""Platoon"" was great, but lacked the epic feel. ""Black Hawk Down"", whilst show-casing much of modern urban warfare, was somewhat incoherent and disjointed.""TaeGukGi"" (Brotherhood of War) - one of only two movies directed by Je-gyu Kang -, then, is as close to perfect as war-movie perfection gets.Jin-Tae and Jin-Seok. Two brothers, the older being Jin-Tae, sent off to defend the Pusan perimeter during the North Korea's invasion of the South in 1950. Big brother turns hero to protect the younger brother and hopefully get him sent home. After numerous split heads, blown-up bodies, cold-blooded killing by both sides, they are split up with Jin-Tae being captured by, and eventually fighting for, the North Koreans. A momentous and heart-felt climax ensues in the midst of some of the most gruesome battle scenes on film ever (let alone from Asian cinema).Director Je-Gyu Kang is a master at taking you deep into the horror, the loss, the community-ripping character of war.The love between the brothers is poignantly portrayed. The stronger and weaker, one risking everything to protect the other, both growing apart in their view and determination in the war, both estranged, one hating the other, until both are united in the worst of situations again, pledging their love for each other.Je-gyu Kang is also an expert of the contrast of before and after. He makes is very clear how the war changed families and hearts. From the start, where the two brothers and their family are shown together in blissful harmony and joy, only for war to intervene and for them to recollect the earlier good life as motivation to keep fighting.You won't see any computer-generated armies in Brotherhood but this is more than compensated by truckloads of extras which also help in retaining an authentic feel. The gore, explosions, blood, maggots, etc. (all made from good 'ol plastic and red paint, I suspect) are also real and graphic enough to make you wince - proof that CGI isn't a must-have for a great movie, even today.History students are also privileged by the movie, which shows the back-and-forth character of the Korean War and the fluctuating reaction of its South Korean combatants throughout.This movie also demonstrates the absolutely crucial role of a powerful original score. Almost everyone who's watched it commented on the part the music played in connecting the audience with the narrative. It throws the movie at the doorstep of your soul and leaves you trembling.Yet, most importantly, it reflects Je-gyu Kang's anguish as a South Korean, living everyday in the reality of divided Korea, hoping (against hope?) that reunification can reoccur without more bloodshed, despairing over the many families and lives torn apart as the peninsular became the pawn of bigger countries and corrupted egos.This is a theme also explored in his other big movie, ""Shiri"" (a film with also much 'contrast', depth and violence), and cannot but stick with you all the way to the end.Part Korean history (and anguish), part Korean culture (and mindset), part character transformation through conflict, Brotherhood is all a war movie should be.",5,"Gratuitious War, Great Movie",1175212800,"03 30, 2007",2007,3442,"['Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'starting', 'out', 'magnificiently', 'fizzled', 'out', 'halfway', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'well-designed', 'battle', 'scenes', 'had', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'may', 'have', 'tried', 'accomplish', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'little', 'reel', 'WindTalkers', 'action-packed', 'came', 'overly', 'fantastic', 'various', 'points', 'Platoon', 'was', 'great', 'lacked', 'epic', 'feel', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'whilst', 'show-casing', 'much', 'modern', 'urban', 'warfare', 'was', 'somewhat', 'incoherent', 'disjointed', 'TaeGukGi', 'Brotherhood', 'War', 'one', 'only', 'two', 'movies', 'directed', 'Je-gyu', 'Kang', 'then', 'as', 'close', 'perfect', 'war-movie', 'perfection', 'gets.Jin-Tae', 'Jin-Seok', 'Two', 'brothers', 'older', 'being', 'Jin-Tae', 'sent', 'off', 'defend', 'Pusan', 'perimeter', 'North', 'Korea', 'invasion', 'South', '1950', 'Big', 'brother', 'hero', 'protect', 'younger', 'brother', 'hopefully', 'get', 'sent', 'home', 'numerous', 'split', 'heads', 'blown-up', 'bodies', 'cold-blooded', 'killing', 'sides', 'are', 'split', 'up', 'Jin-Tae', 'being', 'captured', 'eventually', 'fighting', 'North', 'Koreans', 'momentous', 'heart-felt', 'climax', 'ensues', 'midst', 'most', 'gruesome', 'battle', 'scenes', 'film', 'ever', 'let', 'alone', 'Asian', 'cinema', '.Director', 'Je-Gyu', 'Kang', 'master', 'taking', 'deep', 'horror', 'loss', 'community-ripping', 'character', 'war.The', 'love', 'brothers', 'poignantly', 'portrayed', 'stronger', 'weaker', 'one', 'risking', 'everything', 'protect', 'other', 'growing', 'apart', 'view', 'determination', 'war', 'estranged', 'one', 'hating', 'other', 'are', 'united', 'worst', 'situations', 'again', 'pledging', 'love', 'other.Je-gyu', 'Kang', 'also', 'expert', 'contrast', 'very', 'clear', 'how', 'war', 'changed', 'families', 'hearts', 'start', 'where', 'two', 'brothers', 'family', 'are', 'shown', 'together', 'blissful', 'harmony', 'joy', 'only', 'war', 'intervene', 'recollect', 'earlier', 'good', 'life', 'motivation', 'keep', 'fighting.You', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'computer-generated', 'armies', 'Brotherhood', 'more', 'compensated', 'truckloads', 'extras', 'also', 'help', 'retaining', 'authentic', 'feel', 'gore', 'explosions', 'blood', 'maggots', 'etc', 'made', 'good', 'plastic', 'red', 'paint', 'suspect', 'are', 'also', 'real', 'graphic', 'enough', 'make', 'wince', 'proof', 'CGI', ""n't"", 'must-have', 'great', 'movie', 'even', 'today.History', 'students', 'are', 'also', 'privileged', 'movie', 'back-and-forth', 'character', 'Korean', 'War', 'fluctuating', 'reaction', 'South', 'Korean', 'combatants', 'throughout.This', 'movie', 'also', 'absolutely', 'crucial', 'role', 'powerful', 'original', 'score', 'Almost', 'everyone', 'who', 'watched', 'commented', 'part', 'music', 'played', 'connecting', 'audience', 'narrative', 'movie', 'doorstep', 'soul', 'trembling.Yet', 'most', 'importantly', 'Je-gyu', 'Kang', 'anguish', 'South', 'Korean', 'living', 'everyday', 'reality', 'divided', 'Korea', 'hoping', 'hope', 'reunification', 'can', 'reoccur', 'more', 'bloodshed', 'despairing', 'many', 'families', 'torn', 'apart', 'peninsular', 'became', 'pawn', 'bigger', 'countries', 'corrupted', 'egos.This', 'theme', 'also', 'explored', 'other', 'big', 'movie', 'Shiri', 'film', 'also', 'much', ""'contrast"", 'depth', 'violence', 'can', 'not', 'stick', 'way', 'end.Part', 'Korean', 'history', 'anguish', 'part', 'Korean', 'culture', 'mindset', 'part', 'character', 'transformation', 'conflict', 'Brotherhood', 'war', 'movie', 'should', 'be']",Tae Guk Gi - The Brotherhood of War

This movie did that to me.It started with the life of two brothers before the war, a life that was almost perfect until the war shatters it. Everything goes downhill from there. Despite all their best intentions, the two brothers helplessly watched their fate sinking and themselves drifting apart. Overall it's a very intense tragedy, dotted with only moments of hope and triumgh.The unconditional love between the two brothers, tangled with cruelty of war, made the movie so heart-wrenching that it's almost painful to watch. I can't imagine what it feels like to be the little brother who had to carry this for the next 50 years, not knowing where his brother is, and with the pair of shoes to remind him that they had it perfect for a while.Being a big war-movie fan, I have watched a ton of them. This one is definitely among the best. Comparing to ""Saving Private Ryan"", this movie gives characters a more human touch. ""SPR"" seems to moralize too much, no flaws, just hero's. The result is the characters came off plain and two-dimensional. Agree with some reviewer's comments that ""SPR almost seems like nothing more than a visually stunning, flag-waving movie"". By the way, I am a big fan of Steven Spielburg and Tom Hanks, so there wasn't any bias there. On a side note, ""Band of brothers"", on the contrary, is very good.As for special effects, it's good. But we have seen it all in big-budget Hollywood movies, so that's not what made this movie special. It's the intense human emotion made this movie an unforgettable experience. Hats off to Koreans for making such a great epic. I think this one deserve an Oscar. If a movie like ""Lord of the Ring"" can win something, so should this.The only complaints that I could think of are: 1. The movie can get quite sentimental from time to time, especially the music during the beginning of the movie. 2. The camera shakes too much during action scenes, probably deliberately, to create the chaos with a limited budget. But I don't have a problem with the length of the movie. The 2.5 hrs felt like nothing once you are drawn into the intensity of the movie. Actually when the movie finished, I wished it didn't have to end, or at least didn't have to end like that.As for some reviewer shooting down the movie because of a Hershey Bar with barcode, give me a break. I would rather watch a movie like this with 10 bloopers than one that gets all the details right but doesn't touch a soul.IMHO, Matt Zoller Seitz from New York Press wrote the most accurate review on this movie: ""Tae Guk Gi bypasses academic concerns and plugs straight into one's emotions.

Similar in its graphic nature to the terrific ""Saving Private Ryan"" it also evoked many poignant moments as did SPR.  The stark realism of the many staged battle scenes of the Korean conflict surpassed anything that I've previously seen and left me utterly flabbergasted.The plot surrounds two young Korean brothers from a tightly knit fatherless family based in Seoul, who get sucked into the ideological quagmire that was the Korean War.  At the onset of the film, 50 years after the war one brother gets a call from the army who have been excavating battle sites.  They apparently have found remains which they mistakenly believe are his.  He immediately suspects that they may be those of his beloved brother and the plot begins to recount the brothers' wartime experiences.The younger brother Jin-Seok played by Bin Won is a cerebral university bound student who is supported in his studies by older brother Jin-tae played by Dong-Kun Jang.  Jin-tae has vowed to protect his younger brother and exhibits suicidal heroism and gallantry during combat in the belief that if he wins a medal, his brother would be allowed to return home to the family.The story follows the ebb and flow and changing tides of the war as the brothers fight through murderous conditions to remain alive.Director Kang does a wonderful job in depicting the confused mindset of the Korean people as they get seduced by the promises of both democracy and communism.  The finale of the flick is a moving return from the past to the present as one brother touchingly eulogizes his fallen sibling.",5,Sensational Korean War epic,1129680000,"10 19, 2005",2005,1674,"['Director', 'Je-gyu', 'Kang', 'extraordinary', 'Tae', 'Guk', 'Gi', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'remarkable', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Similar', 'graphic', 'nature', 'terrific', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'also', 'evoked', 'many', 'poignant', 'moments', 'did', 'SPR', 'stark', 'realism', 'many', 'staged', 'battle', 'scenes', 'Korean', 'conflict', 'surpassed', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'previously', 'seen', 'left', 'utterly', 'flabbergasted.The', 'plot', 'two', 'young', 'Korean', 'brothers', 'tightly', 'knit', 'fatherless', 'family', 'based', 'Seoul', 'who', 'get', 'sucked', 'ideological', 'quagmire', 'was', 'Korean', 'War', 'onset', 'film', '50', 'years', 'war', 'one', 'brother', 'call', 'army', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'excavating', 'battle', 'sites', 'apparently', 'have', 'found', 'remains', 'mistakenly', 'believe', 'are', 'immediately', 'may', 'be', 'beloved', 'brother', 'plot', 'recount', 'brothers', 'wartime', 'experiences.The', 'younger', 'brother', 'Jin-Seok', 'played', 'Bin', 'Won', 'cerebral', 'university', 'bound', 'student', 'who', 'supported', 'studies', 'older', 'brother', 'Jin-tae', 'played', 'Dong-Kun', 'Jang', 'Jin-tae', 'vowed', 'protect', 'younger', 'brother', 'exhibits', 'suicidal', 'heroism', 'gallantry', 'combat', 'belief', 'medal', 'brother', 'would', 'be', 'allowed', 'return', 'home', 'family.The', 'story', 'ebb', 'flow', 'changing', 'tides', 'war', 'brothers', 'fight', 'murderous', 'conditions', 'remain', 'alive.Director', 'Kang', 'wonderful', 'job', 'depicting', 'confused', 'mindset', 'Korean', 'people', 'get', 'seduced', 'promises', 'democracy', 'communism', 'finale', 'flick', 'moving', 'return', 'past', 'present', 'one', 'brother', 'touchingly', 'fallen', 'sibling']",Tae Guk Gi - The Brotherhood of War
874826,A1L8VND1P6YZ5V,B0006VL1J2,Daniel J. Cragg,"[11, 20]","The average GI who fought in the Korean War did not have a very high opinion of the South Korean (ROK) fighting man. I think that was due largely to the fact that South Korea was caught completely unprepared for the surprise attack Pyongyang launched against it on June 25, 1950.  Unfortunately, many people in South Korea today seem to have forgotten that lesson and perhaps ""Tae Guk Gi"" will remind them of it. But by the time I got to know Korean soldiers, in Vietnam and later in South Korea, they had earned a solid reputation as tough and competent soldiers and allies who could be counted on.  This film, in the tradition of such classic war movies as ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Band of Brothers,"" and ""Battleground,"" at last exposes Western audiences to the fact that during 1950-1954 the South Koreans fought a bitter and bloody war against intractable and vicious enemies.  The first few minutes of ""Tae Guk Gi"" are the most poignant I've ever seen in a war movie, powerful in their statement of the cost of that war to the Korean people.  It is in this regard that I think ""Tae Guk Gi"" is a film worth seeing because it accentuates the basic humanity of the Korean people whom we GIs little understood and often referred to in very derogatory terms.  The battle scenes are intense and graphic and the equipment and weapons all appear very authentic, which I always appreciate in a war movie.  Some scenes, especially the hand-to-hand fights, are dragged out much too long; there is a lot of over-acting; the entire war is encapsulated in this one movie, which is confusing to those who are not familiar with that conflict; and some of the plot twists are simply too far-fetched to work.  But in the final analysis, ""Tae Guk Gi"" deserves a place of honor next to other foreign war films such as ""The Winter War,"" and ""Stalingrad.""",3,Saving Private Jin-seok,1108771200,"02 19, 2005",2005,1837,"['average', 'GI', 'who', 'fought', 'Korean', 'War', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'very', 'high', 'opinion', 'South', 'Korean', 'ROK', 'fighting', 'man', 'think', 'was', 'due', 'largely', 'fact', 'South', 'Korea', 'was', 'caught', 'completely', 'unprepared', 'surprise', 'attack', 'Pyongyang', 'launched', 'June', '25', '1950', 'Unfortunately', 'many', 'people', 'South', 'Korea', 'today', 'seem', 'have', 'forgotten', 'lesson', 'perhaps', 'Tae', 'Guk', 'Gi', 'will', 'remind', 'time', 'got', 'know', 'Korean', 'soldiers', 'Vietnam', 'later', 'South', 'Korea', 'had', 'earned', 'solid', 'reputation', 'tough', 'competent', 'soldiers', 'allies', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'counted', 'film', 'tradition', 'such', 'classic', 'war', 'movies', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'Battleground', 'last', 'exposes', 'Western', 'audiences', 'fact', '1950-1954', 'South', 'Koreans', 'fought', 'bitter', 'bloody', 'war', 'intractable', 'vicious', 'enemies', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'Tae', 'Guk', 'Gi', 'are', 'most', 'poignant', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'war', 'movie', 'powerful', 'statement', 'cost', 'war', 'Korean', 'people', 'regard', 'think', 'Tae', 'Guk', 'Gi', 'film', 'seeing', 'basic', 'humanity', 'Korean', 'people', 'whom', 'GIs', 'little', 'understood', 'often', 'referred', 'very', 'derogatory', 'terms', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'intense', 'graphic', 'equipment', 'weapons', 'appear', 'very', 'authentic', 'always', 'appreciate', 'war', 'movie', 'scenes', 'especially', 'hand-to-hand', 'fights', 'are', 'dragged', 'out', 'much', 'too', 'long', 'lot', 'over-acting', 'entire', 'war', 'encapsulated', 'one', 'movie', 'confusing', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'conflict', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'far-fetched', 'work', 'final', 'analysis', 'Tae', 'Guk', 'Gi', 'place', 'honor', 'other', 'foreign', 'war', 'films', 'such', 'Winter', 'War', 'Stalingrad']",Tae Guk Gi - The Brotherhood of War

Jin-Tae, the older brother, has foregone the possibility of study in order to provide for his mute mother and his orphaned bride to be, Young-Shin, and her younger brothers and sisters. He works as a shoe-shine boy, is learning the craft of the cordwainer and aspires to open his own shoe store. Jin-Seok, his younger brother, is regarded by Jin-Tae and their mother as the rising star of the family and many of Jin-Tae's sacrifices have been made in order to ensure that Jin-Seok, who suffers from a heart defect, has a decent shot at an education and an academic career.However, the bleak spectre of civil war between the capitalist South and the communist North is waiting at the periphery of their simple world and when it intrudes upon their lives, it will have devastating consequences for both of them...'Brotherhood' is a film which is easily superior to any war film to have come out of the west, with possibly the exception of Terence Malick's,The Thin Red Line. It has a breadth and scope which rivals that of the great David Lean's epicLawrence of Arabia (Collector's Edition, 2 discs) - DVDand in many ways emulates, in it's simply told story of a family caught up in the tumult of world-shaping events, that director's adaptation of Pasternak's,Doctor Zhivago.But be under no illusions, this is no genteel tale told in soft chromatic hues: the violence, brutality and conflict that Jin-Tae and Jin-Seok witness and participate in, once they have been unwittingly drafted into the south Korean army, is visceral, graphic and surpasses even that seen in Spielberg's vastly inferiorSaving Private Ryan (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition).Many of us in the west have been soft-pedalled the horrors and repercussions of the war in Korea due to the proliferation of programs likeM*A*S*H - Martinis and Medicine Complete Collectionand the films of Sam Fuller.

874833,A19QIBFRAZNAIK,B0006VL1J2,"E. Kim ""wangkon936""","[175, 182]","I thought this movie was very good.  It has its flaws (which I will get into later), but overall, it's a very well done piece of cinema.  This film, along with many others is proof that Korean movies, and by extension Asian movies, have grown up and are ready to seriously compete with Hollywood for global influence, audience and market share.  I am impressed with Tae Guk Gi's attention to detail, special effects, cinematography and other high production standards.Now, enough people here give you a quick synopsis of the story and adequate description of the plot, so what I am going to do is respond to some of the comments that other reviewers have made.  I think my input might be helpful be cause I am a Korean raised in North America and can understand both worlds and explain things that were either misinterpreted or not clearly understood by non-Korean reviewers.Some non-Korean reviewers have commented that it seemed like there was some over acting or acting ""over the top"" going on.  Well, believe it or not, Koreans act like that in real life.  They are emotional by nature, yell at each other a lot, slap around their younger peers, etc.  Jin Sok and Jin Tae's mother collapsing after the train departs looks like something a Korean mother would do in that situation.  What some non-Koreans would consider as ""overacting"" I would, as someone from a Korean background, consider realistic and normal (give the extreme situations that the characters go through).  Anyone who thinks overacting is purposely going on in this movie needs to join the peace corp or something and get exposed to other cultures in different parts of the world.One reviewer thought that Koreans fought unusually well given their supposed reputation at the time as poor soldiers.  Well yes, South Korean soldiers did run away and retreat from North Koreans early in the war.  South Koreans were badly underequipped and poorly trained because the U.S. thought their priorities in 1949 were in rebuilding Japan, not stop communism in the Korean peninsula.  It's interesting to note that U.S. soldiers early in the war also broke and fled the field because they were fat and lazy occupation troops formally stationed in Japan.  Jin Tae and Jin Sok were in the 1st ROK division commanded by the brilliant 29 year old general Paik Sun Yup.  The 1st ROK division never broke or fled the field without orders.  It reached Pyongyang before any U.S. units despite the fact that they didn't have as many motor vehicles and was largely a foot mobile unit.  Thus, the scenes were ROK troops are fighting without U.S. support in the streets of Pyongyang are largely true.  Speaking of General Paik, if any of you want to read a Korean War history book that's from a fair Korean perspective, read Paik's book entitled ""From Pusan to Panmunjom.""  It's available on Amazon.I understand that this movie has been compared quite a bit with Saving Private Ryan.  I have to say that in the areas of intensity, dramatic power and overall sincerity, I believe Tae Guk Gi supasses Saving Private Ryan.  However, in terms of battlefield realism and special effects, I believe SPR surpasses TGG.  To me, the battlefield effects are a notch below SPR, but a notch above John Woo combat movies like Windtalkers.  I mean, molotov cocktails exploding like motar rounds when they should really flash and flame modestly, machine guns blaze without spent cartridges being expended, the tanks look like an inaccurate cross between a Sherman and a Pershing, cannon rounds and grenades alike all seem to have the same size explosions, so on and so forth (btw, Jin Tae does not walk through a hail of gun fire from a ""mini-gun"".

874834,AYG1U47VFZ165,B0006VL1J2,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[23, 24]","Nations do not fight wars.  Citizens fight them, and these citizens are honorable men and women who serve their country willingly or, as history shows, by decree of a desperate government.As a result, patriotism has become the unlikeliest casualty.  Once welcomed in the trenches of battle, patriotism has lost its limbs, fought back from life support, and suffered shell shock.  Once easily recognized, patriotism has become a bit of a chimera, an ideal more easily attached to definable characteristics than it is any single soldier.  However, in the bitter end, patriotism is defined by the actions of these individuals who serve; it is rewarded by the nations who sponsor this service; and, more often than not, it is measured in hardships endured.Such is the complex, ever-changing battleground of writer/director Kang Je-Gyu's ""Taegukgi: The Brotherhood of War.""In 1950's Seoul, Jin-Seok (Won Bin) and his older brother Jin-Tae (Jang Dong-gun) are enjoying a strong family life of perfect happiness.  Suddenly, they find their lives turned upside down as soldiers of the South Korean government seize them - all men aged 18 to 30 are taken - and they are forced to take up arms - despite their lack of training - against the approaching North Koreans.  On one brutal battlefield after another, the bonds of family are put to increasingly demanding tests as Jin-Tae - originally driven by his responsibility to protect his younger brother - continues to further exhaust his physical and emotional prowess despite the protests of Jin-Seok.  He learns that he is a good soldier, one with a talent for inspiring others as well as an unanticipated thirst for killing the enemy.  Eventually, these two brothers - once bound by a love for family - find themselves at odds within this new brotherhood of war, and the pressures to prove one another continue to exact heavier and heavier tolls as the war escalates.  As circumstances evolve, the brothers inevitably find themselves on opposite sides of a losing conflict ... but can either find a path to redemption or reconciliation that can save both of them?There are many elements of ""Taegukgi"" that elevate the film from the status of standard war film to a message of hope set against the backdrop of war.  The film's scope is grand, dealing with the far more intimate themes of family, brotherhood, and personal responsibility when Director Kang Je-Gyu could have easily opted for banging the drum of nationalism.  At its core, ""Taegukgi"" is the story of two brothers, a strikingly poignant analogy for the entire North Korea / South Korea dilemma.  While the battlefield choreography is as frenetic as it is harrowing, it never takes the film's center: this picture is founded on relationships - the human perspective to the world outside - and it never falters.  Instead of focusing on history, Kang Je-Gyu crafts every scene to highlight the thoughts, actions, and emotions of the participants of history, and, for that, ""Taegukgi"" deserves countless accolades.Much like exploring the heart of darkness as depicted in American classics as Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" and Oliver Stone's ""Platoon,"" Kang Je-Gyu forces Jin-tae to explore his own budding evil, and this journey is not without its own relative scars.  Once a man has crossed over and embraced wartime madness, can he ever truly find a way out?  Arguably, if ""Taegukgi"" suffers from any setback, it is that perhaps Jin-tae goes too far for an audience to accept his madness: believing his brother to have been killed by North Koreans, Jin-tae turns traitor once he is captured and seeks to wipe out every soldier serving South Korea.  While the story offers the motivation for so drastic a change, it's hard to believe that the man who once fought so valiantly against the spread of Communism would suddenly choose to embrace it.Still, it's a small diversion ... but it's necessary to bring the aspect of brotherhood full circle, to have these two unique men face their darkest hour, and to make one final statement on the role that family inevitably plays in every man's life.Recently, thanks to the worldwide success of ""Taegukgi"" and 1999's blockbuster ""Shiri,"" Director Kang Je-Gyu has signed an agreement with Hollywood's own powerhouse, CAA, to produce his next film in America.  Only time will tell whether or not this agreement will afford some of the ""Korean sensibility"" to American films, but certainly having one of South Korea's premier directors breaking into the Hollywood film system is a tremendous advantage for fans of international film.Only the passage of time will earn ""Taegukgi"" its rightful spot alongside the other great films dealing with the consequences of war.",5,Brotherhood of Man,1108512000,"02 16, 2005",2005,4719,"['Nations', 'do', 'not', 'fight', 'wars', 'Citizens', 'fight', 'citizens', 'are', 'honorable', 'men', 'women', 'who',

Full Metal Jacket, Das Boot, and The Thin Red Line are a few that I truly admire, and while Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War is somewhere near the bottom of my list of favorites, it is still a surprisingly good war film. It's set during the Korean War, and it shows how it affects the lives of two brothers (and the people around them) as they are forced to join the infantry and fight against their enemies. As a Korean myself, I was deeply moved by this movie. It not only shows some gut-wrenching violent content, but also the chaos that Korea and its people experienced before it was officially divided. It reminded me of all the sacrifices made to keep Korea away from communism, and while it wasn't a complete success, I'm still thankful that one half is not subjected to communism. Like many other war films, this is a dark & brooding film, and it should not be watched with an empty stomach.

874837,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0006VL1J2,Grady Harp,"[50, 53]","TAE GUK GI (literally translated, is the name of the South Korean Flag) or THE BROTHERHOOD OF WAR is one of the most consistently moving, desperately realistic, harrowingly poignant films about war in the international motion picture repertoire. While many directors and writers have prolifically produced films about the Civil War in the US, World Wars I and II, the Vietnam War, and other wars from other countries,  few have touched on the Korean War.  Director Kang Je-gyu corrects that omission with this dazzling epic and in doing so, he elects to make the story of that war a tale of two brothers (a metaphor for the North vs. South Korean conflict ignited by the fires of communism versus capitalism).Jin-tae (the strikingly handsome and fine actor Jang Dong-gun) shines shoes and works at small jobs to encourage his younger brother Jin-seok (the refined and delicate actor Won Bin) to study to go to college to be the saviour of  their poor family.  The degree of camaraderie of these two brothers is some of the most touchingly portrayed on film.  The joy of this South Korean family fills the screen for the first moments of the film, only to change abruptly on June 25, 1950 when suddenly the North Koreans attack at the 38th parallel, forcing communism and death down the throats of the South Koreans.  Jin-tae realizes he must join the South Korean army to protect his mistakenly conscripted brother from the horrors of war.The remainder of the film explores the progress of this war with great detail, leaving no battle untold and visually depicting the atrocities of war more brutally than any other film of this genre.  But overriding the visuals of the war is the relationship of the two brothers, their reliance one each other, and the gradual transformation of Jin-tae into a well-trained soldier bent on being a hero to gain medals, for in doing so, he is assured that the younger, worthier Jin-seok can return home to safety.The poison of war infects Jin-tae's personality and he becomes obsessed with killing, a fact that eventually frightens Jin-seok into believing that his brother's criteria have changed for the worse.  The two are split, Jin-seok is mistakenly taken captive as a 'communist sympathizer' when he briefly returns to his home, and when Jin-tae feels he has lost not only his brother's love but that his brother is dead, Jin-tae's rage drives him to join the ranks of the North Koreans.How the truth of the misinformation that always accompanies war tears at the bond of the brothers is finally resolved in a way that explains the futility and madness of war as clearly as has been captured on film.  Credit Director writer Kang Je-gyu and his extraordinary cast and crew with not only making us understand the elusive history of the Korean War, but also the universal lessons that we still fail to recall whenever conflicts merge into warheads.The DVD is accompanied by a separate disc that includes the 'making of the film' and a lot of the history of the Korean War by scholars and veterans of that war.  This is a monumental achievement that deserves as wide attention internationally as it gained upon its release in South Korea in 2004.  A tough, yet ultimately tender film, with the sanctity of familial love at its roots.  Highly Recommended.

874839,A2UQK3DAZ8NO2T,B0006VL1J2,"Hiram Grant ""just call me Sam""","[2, 2]","""Tae Guk Gi"" is a fine tale of two brothers forced to fight in a war that neither understands.  The older, less literate is protective of his younger, college bound sibling, so much so that he makes a deal with his commanding officer: If I perform bravely enough to receive a medal for heroism, then my younger brother shall be free to return home.  His daring, and its effects on the younger brother is the driving force of the movie.  Additionally, the longing of the older for his fiance is a secondary, yet pivotal storyline in the movie.The preface to war, were we see the two young brothers, is very wonderfully done.  The war brings about an aging to the characters, and they do look older.  The action is fun enough for any action fan, but the story of the brothers commands the most attention.The DVD extras are very nice.  One short has interviews with the director, writers and actors, along with real-life survivors of the war.

I thought Private Ryan was graphically violent but this film gives Spielberg's a run for its money in the gore department. That being said, what I like most about this film is that it looks at a war that has not be the subject of American films since the 1950s (Porkchip Hill, Steel Helmet, Fixed Bayonets). I was not aware that South Korean vigilantes executed civilians who had dealings with North Korean soldiers who overran their homes during the first weeks of the war. (According to the movie, these dealings were sometimes little more than taking food from the invaders.) I did not know that the South Korean rounded up young civilian men and forced them to join the army. So I learned something. In addition, the film brings home the absolute horror and savagery of the Korean War (massacres of civilians, forcing prisoners to defect or be killed).I do have to agree with some of the other reviewers that this movie lays it on pretty thick in the melodrama department. The final confrontation between the two brothers is especially unplausible. In the end though, I recommend this movie. It is 140 minutes long but moves along very quickly.

While it is hampered by some truly mawkish sentimentality (the last 20 minutes, in particular, should have been cut from the film), it's also an undeniably world class production that brings the horrors of war to the screen as well as any other film ever has.  Forced conscription, brutality, torture, and state repression were shown as they probably really occurred, as vices employed by both sides in the conflict.  The acting is routinely excellent and the story flows very quickly thru its 140 minutes.  When I left the theater there were very few people who hadn't been at least quietly crying.  But it's not really a sad film, it's an intimate family tale told in a sweepingly epic form.If you liked this do check out the director's earlier hit Shiri.  It's a modern day Cold War yarn, a lesser production to be sure, but quite remarkable for a summer blockbuster in both its relevance and freshness.Finally, I must say that for a film like this to be completely ignored by the Oscars is further proof of the increasing insignificance of that whole event as an objective judge of artistic merit in film.

Naturally, Americans will have more interest in watching films about Americans fighting in a war. That doesn't mean, however, that foreign war films such as this don't offer a perspective that Americans can't identify with.  This is a great war movie by any standards. Although Koreans will undoubtedly find this movie most compelling, it also offers much to other nationalities and cultures.In addition to vicious and realistic battle sequences, this movie, perhaps unintentionally, provides deep insights into the core Korean values of family and education.  The movie is about two brothers. The older brother willingly sacrifices himself (both economic opportunities and his own life) for the sake of his younger brother. The older brother is most proud of his younger brother's accomplishments in school, where he is an excellent student. Towards the end of the movie, the last lines are about going to school and finishing education even when Korea has been decimated and people have nothing left to eat or roofs over their head.One oversight of this movie is it leaves no mention of the heroic American sacrifices in the Korean war. Over 36,000 Americans gave their lives in that horrible and brutal war. 137,000 South Korean soldiers also gave their lives. I felt the American involvement and sacrifices deserved at least a few lines of recognition and respect. But this movie was created when George W Bush, who was the most hated man in the world, was the US President.This movie will leave you in tears.

874845,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B0006VL1J2,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[1, 1]","The film is technically outstanding.  Like ""Saving Private Ryan,"" Taegukgi spares no pains to show that war is hell; the battle scenes look like documentary footage, not a ""war movie"", and have a ferocity I've seen in no other film.  Unfortunately, the movie goes on at such length and with--I wish I could find another word that fits--such zeal that it becomes faintly unpleasant.  And not unpleasant in the sense that yes, war is not supposed to be nice, but in the sense that there's a difference between depicting and wallowing.  You can only show soldiers from the South angrily gunning down soldiers from the North so many times before it becomes a clich&eacute;, and a somewhat repugnant one at that.  I'm reminded, unfortunately, of Franois Truffaut's main contention with war movies: all too often they made war look like fun, not like hell on earth.If the relationship between the two brothers is what makes the film, it is also what unmakes it, no thanks to the movie's muddled and manipulative plotting.  At one point the two come across a cadre of wounded North Korean soldiers in a mine, one of whom was a childhood friend of Jin-tae but was forcibly conscripted into the Northern army.  ""All I see now is a communist,"" Jin-tae says (too obvious, and too much too soon, really), and prepares to kill him. Jin-seok then leaps to the boy's defense, and watches over him in when he's kept as a POW.  This leads to another, deeply unpleasant scene where the Northern prisoners are forced to fight.  Jin-tae takes great pride in demonstrating how they need to beat each other; Jin-seok steps in and starts throwing punches himself, and the movie conveniently forgets about his weak heart to make its point.Both of these scenes, and a fair deal of the rest of the movie, suffer from the same problem: they are willing to ignore the logic of character and circumstance to make points that could be otherwise delivered every bit as effectively.  They also show off the film's general and complete lack of subtlety. But the brothers are convincing--even when the script is marching them off a cliff--and their performances are well worth seeing even when they're surrounded by a story that hasn't been constructed with the same care to attention as the war scenery.  It is hard for me to say this movie is not worth seeing, though, because it is: It shows a side of a war that has almost never been seen by an English-speaking audience, even if it isn't everything it could have been.",4,This is a side of the Korean War I've never seen before,1176163200,"04 10, 2007",2007,2489,"['film', 'technically', 'outstanding', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Taegukgi', 'pains', 'show', 'war', 'hell', 'battle', 'scenes', 'look', 'documentary', 'footage', 'not', 'war', 'movie', 'have', 'ferocity', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'such', 'length', 'wish', 'could', 'find', 'word', 'such', 'zeal', 'faintly', 'unpleasant', 'not', 'unpleasant', 'sense', 'yes', 'war', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'nice', 'sense', 'difference', 'depicting', 'wallowing', 'can', 'only', 'show', 'soldiers', 'South', 'angrily', 'gunning', 'down', 'soldiers', 'North', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'clich', 'eacute', 'somewhat', 'repugnant', 'one', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'unfortunately', 'Franois', 'Truffaut', 'main', 'contention', 'war', 'movies', 'too', 'often', 'made', 'war', 'look', 'fun', 'not', 'hell', 'relationship', 'two', 'brothers', 'what', 'film', 'also', 'what', 'thanks', 'movie', 'muddled', 'manipulative', 'plotting', 'one', 'point', 'two', 'come', 'cadre', 'wounded', 'North', 'Korean', 'soldiers', 'mine', 'one', 'whom', 'was', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Jin-tae', 'was', 'forcibly', 'conscripted', 'Northern', 'army', 'see', 'now', 'communist', 'Jin-tae', 'too', 'obvious', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'soon', 'really', 'kill', 'Jin-seok', 'then', 'boy', 'defense', 'watches', 'when', 'kept', 'POW', 'deeply', 'unpleasant', 'scene', 'where', 'Northern', 'prisoners', 'are', 'forced', 'fight', 'Jin-tae', 'great', 'pride', 'demonstrating', 'how', 'need', 'beat', 'other', 'Jin-seok', 'steps', 'throwing', 'punches', 'movie', 'conveniently', 'weak', 'heart', 'make', 'point.Both', 'scenes', 'fair', 'deal', 'rest', 'movie', 'suffer', 'same', 'problem', 'are', 'willing', 'ignore', 'logic', 'character', 'circumstance', 'make', 'points', 'could', 'be', 'otherwise', 'delivered', 'bit', 'effectively', 'also', 'show', 'off', 'film', 'general', 'complete', 'lack', 'subtlety', 'brothers', 'are', 'convincing', 'even', 'when', 'script', 'marching', 'off', 'cliff', 'performances', 'are', 'well', 'seeing', 'even', 'when', ""'re"", 'surrounded', 'story', ""n't"", 'been', 'constructed', 'same', 'care', 'attention', 'war', 'scenery', 'hard', 'say', 'movie', 'not', 'worth', 'seeing', 'though', 'side', 'war', 'almost', 'never', 'been', 'seen', 'English-speaking', 'audience', 'even', ""n't"", 'everything', 'could', 'have', 'been']",Tae Guk Gi - The Brotherhood of War

The fact that Tae Guk Gi is about the Korean War alone sets it apart. The fact that it is also one of the best modern war movies is incredible. The South Koreans have a real national treasure on their hands here.It is refreshing to see a movie that doesn't shy away from realism. I appreciated that hatred for the communists was expressed loudly and repeatedly, instead of being held back for fear of offending North Korea. That's bravery. Also, nothing was held back when it comes to showing the gore of war. The punch of the movie depends on it, and, if you can take it, you'll be rewarded. As another reviewer noted, this movie is not for the faint of heart. It out-gores even Saving Private Ryan, at least in sheer volume.This movie is almost non-stop action (so it'll definitely please war film buffs), but, unlike with most modern war pictures, the focus is on emotion and story, rather than on action. The love between the two brothers is the focus. Almost every action that each of the brothers makes is rooted in it. Speaking of story, this film has so many twists and turns that it's impossible to know what's coming. This was such a pleasant surprise, since I was expecting a predictable storyline (such as Saving Private Ryan has). I cried hard during the film, which surprised me since I can't even understand the actors.Note that this disc does have the option of English dubbing (if you just can't stand reading subtitles), but I highly recommend against listening to it. It's not a good dubbing and makes the dialog sound over-the-top and corny, which absolutely ruins the seriousness and intimacy of the story. I would guess that the reviewers stating that the movie contains ""over-acting"" listened to the English dubbing. Don't make the same mistake. Because it's a war movie, the amount of dialog is kept to a minimum, so you don't have to worry about missing the movie because you were reading.If you like intimate ""brother"" stories, action/war films or just the best that the foreign countries have to offer, then this is a definite pick!",5,Tremendously powerful,1132531200,"11 21, 2005",2005,2173,"['love', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'think', 'first', 'only', 'Korean', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Wow', 'what', 'introduction', 'fact', 'Tae', 'Guk', 'Gi', 'Korean', 'War', 'alone', 'apart', 'fact', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'modern', 'war', 'movies', 'incredible', 'South', 'Koreans', 'have', 'real', 'national', 'treasure', 'hands', 'here.It', 'refreshing', 'see', 'movie', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'realism', 'appreciated', 'hatred', 'communists', 'was', 'expressed', 'loudly', 'repeatedly', 'instead', 'being', 'held', 'back', 'fear', 'offending', 'North', 'Korea', 'bravery', 'Also', 'nothing', 'was', 'held', 'back', 'when', 'showing', 'gore', 'war', 'punch', 'movie', 'can', 'take', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rewarded', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'movie', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'even', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'least', 'sheer', 'volume.This', 'movie', 'almost', 'non-stop', 'action', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'please', 'war', 'film', 'buffs', 'most', 'modern', 'war', 'pictures', 'focus', 'emotion', 'story', 'rather', 'action', 'love', 'two', 'brothers', 'focus', 'action', 'brothers', 'rooted', 'Speaking', 'story', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'twists', 'impossible', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'was', 'such', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'was', 'expecting', 'predictable', 'storyline', 'such', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'cried', 'hard', 'film', 'surprised', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'understand', 'actors.Note', 'disc', 'have', 'option', 'English', 'dubbing', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'reading', 'subtitles', 'highly', 'recommend', 'listening', 'not', 'good', 'dubbing', 'dialog', 'sound', 'over-the-top', 'corny', 'absolutely', 'seriousness', 'intimacy', 'story', 'would', 'guess', 'reviewers', 'stating', 'movie', 'over-acting', 'listened', 'English', 'dubbing', 'Do', ""n't"", 'make', 'same', 'mistake', 'war', 'movie', 'amount', 'dialog', 'kept', 'minimum', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'missing', 'movie', 'were', 'reading.If', 'intimate', 'brother', 'stories', 'action/war', 'films', 'just', 'best', 'foreign', 'countries', 'have', 'offer', 'then', 'definite', 'pick']",Tae Guk Gi - The Brotherhood of War

Race ""Jose Mango""","[0, 0]","We know that the story concerns two brothers and their conflicts during the Korean War when the south was invaded by the communists. The battle scenes are well done and photographed magnificently; but some of the situations with the older brother running through machine guns and exposions are tough to believe but then again, some soldiers are lucky and/or have ""the grace of God"" in their corner. No soldier would go into battle if he knew a bullet had his name on the tip.  Much of this movie also concerns the confusion and violence that struck the civilians as the armies went back and forth. One of the ultimate drama and trauma scenes (near the end of the film) seems to be directed towards Jin-tae and his fiancee when she is killed, along with many others, by an anti-communist brigade (she went to the communist rallies so she could have food for the family). Jin-tae believes the younger brother has been killed; he goes a little wacko and goes over to the ""bad guys.""

874852,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0006VL1J2,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 4]","""Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo"" is probably going to be the first South Korean film that a lot of people in this country ever see, so it is no small matter that the film's subject is decidedly about Korea since most of it is set during the Korean War.  Hollywood has produced relatively few movies about the Korean War, and if you are asked to name one you are more likely to name the original version of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" or ""M*A*S*H"" than you are  ""Pork Chop Hill.""  More importantly, the Koreans themselves are secondary or tertiary figures in such films.  What ""Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War"" does is to remind us that the Korean War was a Civil War that divided a nation in half.  In that context it is not surprising that this 2004 film literally is about a pair of brothers who go off to war.The movie begins with a fascinating hook.  A battlefield from the Korean War is being excavated so that remains can be identified and properly buried.  But the computer recrods indicate one of the soldiers they have found is still alive.  A phone call to the old soldier confirms that fact, but what is assumed to be some sort of clerical error at one end of the conversation signals the final chapter of a long story on the other.  We then go back to Seoul in 1950, before the start of the war, when Jin-tae (Dong-Kun Jang) is working hard as a shoeshien boy in order to send his young brother Jin-seok (Bin Won) to college.  With their father gone, Jin-tae is the head of the family, which includes his ailing mother and his fianc?e, Young-shin (Eun-ju Lee).  Then the war begins.Before dawn on June 25, 1950, the North Koreans pushed 135,000 troops across the 38th parallel in a devastating surprise attack.  Two thirds of the 38,000 man South Korean army were off duty and easily routed by the invaders.  Within three days Seoul had been captured, and only President Truman's decision to deploy the U.S. Eighth Army staved off defeat.  The South Korean government began conscripting soldiers to defend the country, and Jin-seok is caught up in one of their sweeps.  Jin-tae tries to get Jin-seok off the train, but instead the two brothers go off to war together, even though custom dictates one son remain at home to keep alive the family name.  But even in the trenches and on the battlefield, Jin-tae continues to watch out for his brother, making himself a war hero in the process.  Then Jin-tae sees an opportunity to win the Medal of Honor, and be able to send his brother home.Writer-director Je-gyu Kang follows the lead of ""Saving Private Ryan"" in terms of portraying the horrors of the battlefield in several sequences involving both the South Korean troops being shelled and also deadly hand-to-hand combat with first North Korean and later Chinese troops (one of the film's most memorable scenes is when Chinese troops crossed the border to attack U.N. forces).  But in every battle sequence what is happening with the two brothers remains paramount and the war is only the back ground at which their tragic tale is played out.  Good intentions can be a burden, and when Jin-tae gets what he most desires, it turns out to be the undoing of not only himself but also of his entire family.Ultimately, the human drama matters more than the battle scenes, due both to the story being told and the performances of the two main actors.  Dong-Kun Jang changes from good-hearted older brother to battle harden veteran, and finally to a man shattered by circumstances.  Bin Won develops a nice arc with his character as well as the school boy grows up, embittered by his fate and what his brother has done in his name, only to realize that he is the one that has made the biggest error of all.  I had my suspicions as to what the framing device might mean for the unraveling of the tale, but I was pleasntly surprised in that the story held true to the determination of one brother to protect another.",5,One brother looks out for the other during the Korean War,1146009600,"04 26, 2006",2006,3913,"['hwinalrimyeo', 'probably', 'going', 'be', 'first', 'South', 'Korean', 'film', 'lot', 'people', 'country', 'ever', 'see', 'small', 'matter', 'film', 'subject', 'decidedly', 'Korea', 'most', 'set', 'Korean', 'War', 'Hollywood', 'produced', 'relatively', 'few', 'movies', 'Korean', 'War', 'are', 'asked', 'name', 'one', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'name', 'original', 'version', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate', 'M*A*S*H', 'are', 'Pork', 'Chop', 'Hill', 'More', 'importantly', 'Koreans', 'are', 'secondary', 'tertiary', 'figures', 'such', 'films', 'What', 'Tae', 'Guk', 'Gi', 'Brotherhood', 'War', 'remind', 'Korean', 'War', 'was', 'Civil', 'War', 'divided', 'nation', 'half', 'context', 'not', 'surprising', '2004', 'film', 'literally', 'pair', 'brothers', 'who', 'go', 'war.The', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'hook', 'battlefield', 'Korean', 'War', 'being', 'excavated', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'identified', 'properly', 'buried', 'computer', 'recrods', 'indicate', 'one', 'soldiers', 'have', 'found', 'still', 'alive', 'phone', 'call', 'old', 'soldier', 'fact', 'what', 'assumed', 'be', 'sort', 'clerical', 'error', 'one', 'end', 'conversation', 'final', 'chapter', 'long', 'story', 'other', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'Seoul', '1950', 'start', 'war', 'when', 'Jin-tae', 'Dong-Kun', 'Jang', 'working', 'hard', 'shoeshien', 'boy', 'order', 'send', 'young', 'brother', 'Jin-seok', 'Bin', 'Won', 'college', 'father', 'gone', 'Jin-tae', 'head', 'family', 'ailing', 'mother', 'fianc', 'e', 'Young-shin', 'Eun-ju', 'Lee', 'Then', 'war', 'begins.Before', 'dawn', 'June', '25', '1950', 'North', 'Koreans', 'pushed', '135,000', 'troops', '38th', 'parallel', 'devastating', 'surprise', 'attack', 'Two', 'thirds', '38,000', 'man', 'South', 'Korean', 'army', 'were', 'off', 'duty', 'easily', 'routed', 'invaders', 'three', 'days', 'Seoul', 'had', 'been', 'captured', 'only', 'President', 'Truman', 'decision', 'deploy', 'U.S.', 'Eighth', 'Army', 'staved', 'off', 'defeat', 'South', 'Korean', 'government', 'began', 'conscripting', 'soldiers', 'defend', 'country', 'Jin-seok', 'caught', 'up', 'one', 'sweeps', 'Jin-tae', 'tries', 'get', 'Jin-seok', 'train', 'instead', 'two', 'brothers', 'go', 'off', 'war', 'together', 'even', 'custom', 'one', 'son', 'remain', 'home', 'keep', 'alive', 'family', 'name', 'even', 'trenches', 'battlefield', 'Jin-tae', 'watch', 'out', 'brother', 'making', 'war', 'hero', 'process', 'Then', 'Jin-tae', 'opportunity', 'win', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'be', 'able', 'send', 'brother', 'home.Writer-director', 'Je-gyu', 'Kang', 'lead', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'terms', 'portraying', 'horrors', 'battlefield', 'several', 'sequences', 'involving', 'South', 'Korean', 'troops', 'being', 'shelled', 'also', 'deadly', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'first', 'North', 'Korean', 'later', 'Chinese', 'troops', 'one', 'film', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'when', 'Chinese', 'troops', 'crossed', 'border', 'attack', 'U.N.', 'forces', 'battle', 'sequence', 'what', 'happening', 'two', 'brothers', 'paramount', 'war', 'only', 'back', 'ground', 'tragic', 'tale', 'played', 'out', 'Good', 'intentions', 'can', 'be', 'burden', 'when', 'Jin-tae', 'what', 'most', 'desires', 'out', 'be', 'undoing', 'not', 'only', 'also', 'entire', 'family.Ultimately', 'human', 'drama', 'matters', 'more', 'battle', 'scenes', 'due', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'performances', 'two', 'main', 'actors', 'Dong-Kun', 'Jang', 'changes', 'good-hearted', 'older', 'brother', 'battle', 'harden', 'veteran', 'finally', 'man', 'shattered', 'circumstances', 'Bin', 'Won', 'nice', 'arc', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'school', 'boy', 'up', 'embittered', 'fate', 'what', 'brother', 'done', 'name', 'only', 'realize', 'one', 'made', 'biggest', 'error', 'had', 'suspicions', 'what', 'framing', 'device', 'might', 'mean', 'unraveling', 'tale', 'was', 'pleasntly', 'surprised', 'story', 'held', 'true', 'determination', 'one', 'brother', 'protect']",Tae Guk Gi - The Brotherhood of War

The older brother is large and strong and shines shoes for a living with the hopes of becoming a shoemaker. His younger brother is 18 years old and the pride of the family because he is going to college.  We first meet these brothers in a happy time when their future looks bright and the older brother is planning to get married.  But suddenly, war is upon them and the family is forced to flee their home in Seoul.  The two brothers are forcibly drafted and we soon see them on the battlefield.The older brother is determined to protect the younger one.  He risks his life to go on dangerous missions because he knows that if he receives a medal, the younger brother will be able to get out of the army.  The battles are gruesome and real and better than any I have ever seen.  I understand that the director accomplished this with a very small budget and I have nothing but applause for him for this effort.  There's a human side of every battle, and I felt real emotion watching them.Somewhere along the line, the older brother turns into a monster of aggression.  Not only does he show exceptional bravery, he also shows exceptional cruelty.This story goes deep into the heart of Korean national identity.  Both sides are equally cruel to ordinary villagers who are just trying to survive.  But one thing is clear and that is the bond between the brothers even though they eventually wind up in opposing armies.  This is a serious film about brotherhood.  And it is also a film about Korea.  Actually, it helped me understand what is happening there today.The film is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and it didn't drag for one single moment.  Something new is happening constantly, whether it is the relationship between the brothers, the different kinds of battles, or the horror in Seoul when the South Koreans are executing North Korean sympathizes and the brothers see their family involved.If you hate watching war films, stay away from this one.  This is surely one of the bloodiest I've ever seen.  But if you are interested in history and in the impact war has on people, this film will help you understand.

They constitute a typical duo: the elder one focused on earning his life and supporting his whole family; the younger one playing the role of the intellectual who may elevate the family condition thru higher studies.They love each other deeply.Unexpectedly war broke up and they are pressed into military service.The elder brother tries to convince authorities to release his weaker brother, but to no avail. He then devises another plan: he will earn an Honor Medal and apply for his brother's discharge.War grows with ceaseless brutality and young Jin-seok starts to emotionally drift apart from Jin-tae, who stubbornly volunteers to every possible dangerous mission.The tides of war favors first one side and next the other. Foreigner powers enter the conflict raising the stakes.Jin-tae finally attains the coveted medal but alas! Nothing goes as he hoped!This film approaches many different subjects in different levels.The more obvious: it is a war movie and a good one by the way; battles are filmed with immitigable ferocity showing gruesome amputations, gory wounds, dirt, sweat and tears.

874861,APFVCVP3Z3O2P,B0006VL1J2,"M. Teasdale ""DTO""","[5, 5]","Tae Guk Gi : The Brotherhood of WarTae Guk Gi (Or Flag of brothers) is the highest grossing film in Korea. Over 20% of the entire population of Korea saw this movie. Directed by famous man Je-Gyu Kang (director of Shiri), this movie focuses on the Korean War: North Korea against South Korea. The North wants to change towards the way of communism, while the South wants to remain the same and not change the way they are. This movie is by far the most beautiful movie I have ever seen, with phenomenal acting, an amazing soundtrack, and characters that fit their parts perfectly. Jin-Seok loved his brother with everything he had, and would sacrifice his life for his brother. He worked as a shoe polisher to save up all the money he could to get Jin-Tae into college to get an education. All of a sudden a war has erupted. Brothers Jin-Tae and Jin-Seok are both drafted into the war, while their mother is left with Jin-Seok's girlfriend, and her three grandkids.  Kang focuses more on the actions of the brothers, and how the war completely changes the way they fight in the war, and each other, rather then a blood festering, pointless action war movie. Jin-Seok tries to find any way possible to get his brother out of the war. He makes an agreement with the commander, that if he were to get the Medal of Honor, his brother would go home; something that the commander thought not possible. Jin-Seok's character begins to develop as he gets carried away with trying to be a hero for his brother, and wants to become one for himself. The ending is the most passionate ending I have ever seen, with a perfect mix of war action, dialogue and music tracks. Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War has everything a war movie should have: an amazing plot, soundtrack, and development.Progression: The movie progresses at a perfect pace. I never found myself bored, or uninterested. Also the movie is easy to follow, and does not veer of the main point it is trying to prove: Love is something that will last forever.Sound: The most beautiful soundtrack I have ever heard in a movie. The War scenes are done extremely well.Special Effects: This movie looks like it would have a 200 plus million dollar budget. But it only was sixteen million. Very impressive.Rating: I have never given a perfect score to anything, but this movie deserves a 10 out of 10.

The movie is an amazing one. I was interested all the way through. From the very beginning it was good and I still wasn't sure how it was going to end until it was over. The movie makes you go through a whole bunch of emotions throughout and it kept me amazed at how great this movie was.

874864,A13DQTXG02HZC1,B0006VL1J2,Ping Lim,"[4, 6]","South Korea has a propensity to replicate what the States had done before.  Few years back, it produced a movie named ""Tube"" that was a splitting image of ""Speed"" and yet, the movie was patchy at best.  Every time I read the flyer bragging about its extensive budget and how it smashed the box office record in Korea, I took it with a pinch of salt.  Yet, ""Brotherhood of War"" was simply brilliant.  The cinematography, CGIs and the movie direction were on-par if  not surpassed ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Band of Brothers"" (TV series produced by Tom Hanks).  In actuality, the technique and soundtrack used faithfully replicated the American versions.  Thus, if you feel like deja-vu, it's not your fault.  The storyline was even a tad similar to ""Saving Private Ryan"" with the retrospective storyline going back half a century from the present day.  What made this movie outstanding was the chemistry and bond between the two brothers.  Both of them were from both ends of the scales, personality-wise and yet, the elder brother would move mountain and ocean just to be sure the younger brother would be protected and that he would survive the ordeal to return home to their mother.  Whilst he's got a fiancee waiting for him back home, the elder brother knew of his obligation as the caretaker of the family as their father had since deceased.  This gives us an insight into the Korean culture, which is based on Confucianism.  Anyway, as the story progressed, and as the characters were exposed to the madness of war, they became mad themselves.  Due to circumstances, the elder brother was led to believe that the younger brother was killed and just like Marlo Brando's character in ""Acropolyse Now"", he went insane, joined the North Korea and fought against the South Korea, all for the love of his family rather than for his support of differing idealogy.  This movie was done in a factual manner with inclusion of Chinese in the war later on, the mentioning of specific locations where the battles broke out at specific dates.  Whilst the 2CDs contained a lot of extras and featurettes, they were rather protracted and I wish they were edited further.  Still, it gave us an insight into how this movie got made.  A movie that reminded us again about the futility of war, and how differing idealogies would have split a country into half when Koreans are sharing the same cultures and speaking the same language (plain madness).  This is a movie more suited for those viewers that want to know about war history, lest we forget.  It's not ideal for family viewing with too much gore and violence.

874865,A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ,B0006VL1J2,Private Quentin Tarantino Fan,"[2, 2]","I think Tae Guk Gi is a very valuable and great war film that manages to stand out amongst a crowded genre.  It has it's flaws, but Tae Guk Gi truly shows and tributes the soldiers of the Korean war from the Korean perspective.  It's ultimate being a heartfelt, painful, and powerful open letter to the people who suffered, the everyday people through the harrowing emotions that almost any soldier in war suffers through.  Tae Guk Gi works it's way into the hearts of most Koreans because it's easy to identity with, not being too far removed from reality, and concerns the emotional state that most of us can easily understand.  Plus, it's a formidable and very strong war film, with a hellish depiction of combat, the emotional toll of the Korean War, and manages to, like any other great war movie, say some powerful messages about the reality of the war in question.  Tae Guk Gi has pretty much everything in it to be a war film, and while not perfect, it succeeds and connects.Tae Guk GI concerns two brothers, Jin-tae and Jin-Seok, who are separated due to the Korean War.  While there, Jin-tae, who wants to make sure his brother can go to college, tries to win the Medal of Honor to send his brother home.  It turns into a melting pot of hate and a vicious cycle that neither can eventually break out of.  But most of all, besides being a personal story, Tae Guk Gi looks at the Korean War and examines it, showing how it split up families, caused hatred in one another, the toll back home, and various other topics concerning the Korean war.  It also includes some very emotional and searing dehumanizing effects of war and it's participants, as it can be very emotionally powerful.I'll get the iffy things out of the way first.  While Tae Guk Gi benefits from a great screenplay, there's plenty of moments where Tae Guk Gi has points that make you question the believability.  The concept of Jin-tae getting the medal so his brother can go home isn't that hard to believe so, but sometimes the battle scenes get a little silly.  Sure, war has tons of acts of gods in battle, but come on, some of the Rambo scenes where he runs through bullets is a little hard to believe.  The ending is especially theatrical, and is a part where you going to need to really consider the improbable in life.  The scenes of hand to hand combat isn't very common in battle either, but it's hard to say because hey, what WOULD happen if everyone ran out of ammo?  The score can be powerful too, but, unlike John William's somber and militaristic score for SPR, the score for Tae Guk Gi has constant use of strings, heavy choirs, and is very operatic, and not as distinct as William's masterful score.  The film could have definitely used a more subtle score at times.Despite all of this, this film is a truly powerful and noteworthy war film that deserves to be mentioned in various lists of war films worth seeing. The parallels of Saving Private Ryan have been beaten to death, but I think, like that film, it is effective because it presents the horrors of war down to earth and does so through battle and the searing emotional state that affects the common solider.  It presents the Korean war in a way that anybody who has sympathy of compassion towards their veterans can easily be affected.  It's easy to see how this film makes such a connection with the Korean people, and while the two films really aren't any much the same due to different wars and sides, there's no denying, like that other film, it affects tons of people because of it's emotional connection towards the people who endured the war the most in great quantities.The other thing it shares with Ryan through is the same type of filming of battle scenes, which are often jaw dropping and bloody.  Extremely graphic and very very wildly filmed (the camera almost NEVER stops shaking), this is probably one of the most graphic war movies I have seen, along with We Were Soldiers.  Limbs getting blown off, blood spraying, bloody gunshots almost every time, graphic bayoneting, the massacre of a village where the bodies just flail wildly in gunfire, maggots caught in wounds, it's definitely extreme in it's violence.  It's combat scenes are definitely hellish as well in the basic way, where there's tons of bullets flying everywhere and if you get hit or stop at once you WILL meet your death.  There's some graphic violence not related to battle that's pretty violent too, such as a top viewed suicide and a village bomb that ends in guts ALL over the place.  It's pretty self explanatory here, and they do not disappoint.  They don't have as much emotion as other battle scenes, but they definitely are jaw dropping and smashing in it's depiction of combat.One thing I would like to mention, is that, while I do not think it's the films fault, the subtitles don't translate as well, as I think this film really works best when you play it without subtitles.  It's native tongue is much more powerful when it sounds like that.  Another thing is the AWFUL English dubbing, which can be turned on if you want to unintentionally laugh at the film.  It sounds like a very cheap anime, and the vocals are so, well, AMERICAN, that it just sounds funny and comical.  Either way, avoid, the dubbing, and hey, if you really want to be adventurous, try watching it without the subtitles after watching the film with them on a couple times.Anyway though, this is a great war film, and although it can be quite disturbing, it's a powerful and ugly look at the Korean War, and watching it may just let you understand the Korean war on screen.  It's a post-Ryan war film that has it's own identity, and is infinitely more memorable than other similar fare like Days of Glory or The 9th Company.  While a little theatrical, Tae Guk Gi is still a powerful and searing look at the Korean War, one that manages to be painful and harrowing at times, but essential viewing and will fill you with great respect for enduring the Korean War.",4,"Ugly, Violent and Spares No Punches",1291420800,"12 4, 2010",2010,5985,"['think', 'Tae', 'Guk', 'Gi', 'very', 'valuable', 'great', 'war', 'film', 'stand',

Ryan all at once.  I am sure many aspects of it resonated well with its Korean target audience.  Those not of this background might feel the acting and action were a bit over the top, as indeed they were.  As a devotee of war film genre I like realistic action and good production value which this film deffinitely has, but there seemed many improbable elments in it which degrade the qaulity somewhat.For one I found the one brother going over to the Chinese side and fighting like a machine for them very unlikely.  The combat scenes while intense were often excessively graphic and filled with extra gore. The same could have been accomplished without so much excess in this regard.  Many of the unlikley hand-to-hand combat scenes seemed one step short of an Asian Kung-Fu epic at times!  On a modern battlefiled I tend to doubt lines of infantry could charge at each other like this!  True the Chinese fought using these kind of human wave tactics and UN firepower made them pay a very high price for it!I think its good that Koreans make a film showing the horrors of a conflict which was both a civil war and war of idealogies.  And its true that many other forces besides the US were involved in this affair.  Certainly the ROK army of South Korea provided the largest elements besides the US.  Also many UN contingents were involved including UK, Canadian, Greek and Turks.  From the UK came many famous regimental names including the Black Watch which provided a stout rearguard for UN forces at the Hook battle, and Royal Marines who astounded US Marines with their level of espirit-de-corps which was unlike anything they had ever seen. And lets not forget the sacrefice of the heroic Gloustershire regiment at the Imjin River battle, where it was virtually wiped-out holding back to the very last the hordes of Communist China. None of this was shown in what is strictly a South Korean production.I am happy to see that Koreans are learing to come to terms with this conflict 50 years later, and that the emotions of it must still seem very real indeed.  In fact the issue is still unresolved with the hostile legions of the North still poised at the 38th Parellel where one of the last remnants of the Cold War remains. This could still turn hot at any moment!  South Koreans need also to recognize the very great debt their country has for the UN and US forces who saved them from being overwhelmed in 1950.  I don't know if this film does that, but it does show what the price of the war was for that country, and while a more mature approach would have made this epic better over all, I still give it credit for trying.

Although it was common practice for only one of two brothers to be inducted, war-time national emergency placed both brothers in the same infantry unit. The older brother's ultimate goal: fight valiantly, to earn an early discharge for his younger sibling, so at least one of them will survive.Enduring intense combat, near-starvation, and Korea's extreme weather, the South Koreans impressively clawed their way out of a major military disaster to almost complete victory! South Korea was an impoverished largely agricultural nation in 1950, still struggling to recover from the tragedies of Japanese occupation and exploitation, and the aftermath of World War 2. When the communist north invaded, South Korean forces and their allies were over-run and pushed to the very end of the Hermit Kingdom's peninsula, stubbornly holding the line at Pusan. Recovering, and gathering their strength, a show down of national will, ...they not only pushed the North Korean forces BACK across the border, ...but pushed them all the way to the Yalu River at North Korea's northern border!Unfortunately, a savage grudge-match of a war was just about to get a lot worse!For anyone who has read at least some of the history, this film is an accurate depiction of the suffering of both the citizenry and the combatants. More emphasis was needed in portraying the brutal excesses and atrocities commited by communist troops, however. Although entirely understandable and justifed, this story portrays how even those on the good side had become too ruthless and fanatical in disposing of the enemy.

Taeguki struck me as a well-done historic film, done as well as Hollywood might have.Comparisons have been made with Saving Private Ryan, so I'll join and say that Taeguki had more grit, faster pacing, deeper emotional draw, and just seemed more real.

The story may be War Hunt revisited as two brothers go to war only to be divided as one is morally consumed by it, but it is surprisingly and genuinely moving come the finale (which handles the modern-day framing device much better than Spielberg's epic). Curiously, the film is very critical of South Korea's conduct of the war, both at the front and at home, and all the more powerful for it.With Korea very much a forgotten war these days, it's good that the DVD extras on the two-disc set include some historical perspective alongside a detailed account of the film's production.",4,A different perspective on a forgotten war,1203120000,"02 16, 2008",2008,903,"['Tae', 'Guk', 'Gi', 'Brotherhood', 'War', 'suffers', 'being', 'hundredth', 'film', 'adopt', 'Spielberg', 'Kaminski', 'now', 'rather', 'tired', 'clich', 'eacute', 'approach', 'filming', 'battle', 'la', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'gains', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'Korean', 'War', 'Korean', 'viewpoint', 'honest', 'sentiment', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'War', 'Hunt', 'revisited', 'two', 'brothers', 'go', 'war', 'only', 'be', 'divided', 'one', 'morally', 'consumed', 'surprisingly', 'genuinely', 'moving', 'come', 'finale', 'modern-day', 'framing', 'device', 'much', 'better', 'Spielberg', 'epic', 'Curiously', 'film', 'very', 'critical', 'South', 'Korea', 'conduct', 'war', 'front', 'home', 'more', 'powerful', 'it.With', 'Korea', 'very', 'much', 'forgotten', 'war', 'days', 'good', 'DVD', 'extras', 'two-disc', 'set', 'include', 'historical', 'perspective', 'detailed', 'account', 'film', 'production']",Tae Guk Gi - The Brotherhood of War
874875,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0006VL1J2,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","A South Korean war drama ""Brotherhood of War"" (""Taegukgi"") chronicles the fate of two disparate brothers Jin-tae Lee (Dong-gun Jang) and Jin-seok Lee (Bin Won) living in 1950 Seoul. When a war breaks out, both brothers are made to enlist in the army and immediately sent to the frontline. Rough and tough Jin-tae is determined to make a name and get promoted so that his younger brother can be sent home, while docile Jin-seok, worried that his brother might lose his life someday, would rather stay with him.The brothers' simple motives develop into something more complicated as the war gets increasingly brutal. The brothers' decisions may change the fate of other soldiers around them, and eventually their own, too. By the time the brothers forget their original motives, we start to think: for whom is it fought?Like ""Saving Private Ryan"" (made about five years before), ""Brotherhood of War"" is notable for its intense combat scenes that are often graphic. Special effects of warplane attack scenes need improvement, but credible hand-to-hand combats make up for that.Director Kang Je-gyu (known for his 1999 megahit Shiri) keeps the film moving at a fast pace all throughout its running time that far exceeds two hours. What ""Brotherhood of War"" needs is more time for supporting characters, especially the brothers' other family members.

874877,A140U4C0D8TGR1,B0006VL1J2,"WrathfulGrape ""(Korean film lover)""","[20, 61]","Before I launch into what is going to be a very harsh review, I want to say that I DO understand how this movie did so spectacularly well at the Korean box office. The Korean War ripped entire families apart and anything with such deep patriotic themes is bound to be successful. It would be as if someone made a movie about 9-11. No matter how bad the movie is, people will flock to see it. It will be that mental and emotional connection that people will identify with and weep to.So this review in no way discounts what may be your emotional connection to the war.Kang Je Kyu (SHIRI) has been described as the Korean Spielberg in many Western reviews of this film. The parallels between TAEGUKGI and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN have been beaten to death.I must STRONGLY disagree with this assessment though.SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was bookended by two extremely well shot and edited war sequences that were graphic and raw and shocked audiences with their realistic depiction of war. They were effective because they plunged you into the war-as-hell motif from the get go and also reminded you at the end of the brutality and the randomness of death. In between, there was 2 hours of character development, so that when you finally get to the second battle scene, you care about the characters so that the war becomes not just raw, but also suspense inducing because of the initial setup.(for the record, I was not a fan of SPR...I did not think that apart from the 2 battle sequences, that it was an effective film, but I do understand what Spielberg was trying to do).With TAEGUKGI, you get the complete opposite.We start off with an approximate 10 minute sequence that introduces us to the characters. We meet the current day Jin Seok, who is summoned to a Korean War site to identify items found. Then we are in the idylllic 1950's Seoul and we meet Jin Tae (played woodenly by Jang Dong Gun), who shines shoes and forewent his education for the sake of his younger brother, Jin Seok's schooling(another one-note performance from current flavor-of-the-week Won Bin). We also meet Jin Tae's fiancee, Young Shin (Lee Eun Ju, in about 7 minutes of total movie screentime).These opening scenes are somewhat charming as we see the love between the 2 brothers and the sets are really good. The actor who played the older Jin Seok is also very touching.However, the movie quickly falls apart after the brothers are separated from their family.We are ""treated"" to battle after battle as Jin Tae tries to protect his younger brother, who has a heart condition, from the war. This one-man Rambo takes on entire SQUADRONS in kamikaze missions in order to win the coveted Hero's Medal so that he can send his younger sibling home.This goes on for about, oh I don't know, TWO HOURS. Relentless battles are really boring. And especially when they are all filmed with handhelds, resulting in myopic seizure since the screen is constantly shaking.In between battles, there will be maybe 5 seconds of real dialogue, which was badly written and cliched as well as badly acted.I swear, I groaned everytime a character said ""let's go fight them!"" And the culmination was a really REALLY ridiculous Jang Dong Gun (why is this actor so famous? HE CAN'T ACT!) with a pointy beard and all, fighting on the side of the North Koreans. To further demonize the North Koreans, his eyeballs are rolled to the back of his head, ala THE EXORCIST. You *really* expect his head to start spinning...I kid you not.There is absolutely no characterization or motivation for these characters. Scenes are dropped in and characters take actions that leave you scratching your head in confusion.Now, why would I give this movie 2 stars out of 5? Isn't that a bit generous considering what I just said?The extra star comes from the last scenes, when the present day Jin Seok returns to the site and realizes that his brother died on the battlefield long ago and was not actually alive in North Korea. There is a very very powerful scene in which all the pain and anguish of the families who have lost members due to the separation of North and South Korea comes full circle. This scene was like something out of a better movie and for this and only this, am I awarding the extra star.This movie is important for all Koreans and Korean Americans to see because it supports the Korean film industry and with the US limited release, if there is enough support, there will be a much better chance of BETTER movies being ported over to a wider audience.However, this movie, is one from a cinematic POV, that I cannot recommend.",2,Looking beyond Taegukgi to the film itself,1109462400,"02 27, 2005",2005,4574,"['launch', 'what', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'harsh', 'review', 'want',

874878,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B0006VL1J2,Zack Davisson,"[3, 3]","One of the things I love about watching foreign-language war films is the perspective they offer. With only American films, we see a single perspective, with generally clear-cut lines about what side we are rooting for.  Some films, likeHeaven & EarthandLetters from Iwo Jima, have tried to offer a more balanced point of view, but they are ultimately still American films made for an American audience, and not quite the same thing as watchingBattle of Okinawaand getting an entirely Japanese perspective.Case in point: Growing up onM*A*S*HI had the idea that the Korean War was fought entirely by Americans, with actual Koreans only showing up from time to time as comedy relief or a plot device.  It was a conflict that I had never given much thought to.  It seemed like an easy war.""Brotherhood"" (""Taegukgi: Hwinalrimyeo"" which translates loosely as ""Flag of Korea"" or ""Yin and Yang"", which makes up the Flag of Korea: ""The Brotherhood of War"") immediately smashes those misperceptions, leaving now doubt that the Korean war was fought for the Koreans, by the Koreans, against the Koreans.  The American army is only on the fringes, lingering as a faint hope of rescue and military power for the embattled troops.The story is a basic set up, with two brothers being involuntarily drafted into the South Korean army.  They are good-natured country folk, with family and true loves. The younger brother, Jin-seok Lee (Bin WonGuns & Talks) is the family's hope, college bound with a good academic record.  Jin-seok is forcibly taken by the army, and the older brother, Jin-tae Lee (Dong-Kun JangThe Coast Guard) joins as well to protect his younger brother, and hopefully secure his release.  Jin-tae is told by one of his commanding officers that if he can win the Medal of Honor for bravery, his younger brother would be allowed to go home.  To win the medal, Jin-tae transforms into a veritable God of War, volunteering for every dangerous mission and facing any danger.  He soon becomes seduced by his own reputation, enjoying being a national hero and showing pleasure in killing the enemy.  Jin-seok is tortured by his older brother's transformation, and does not want his freedom bought at the cost of so many lives and his brother's soul.There are other subplots: Jin-tae has a fianc&eacute; he left behind. Jin-seok has a friend fighting for the other side.  Betrayal and political suspicion lurk in the background, and the story of Jin-tae takes some unsuspected turns.  But ultimately, as the title suggests, this is a tale of two brothers.As a war flick, ""Brotherhood"" treads the line between modern, realistic films that show the ravages and horror of combat, and classic flicks that showcase feats of heroism and thick emotion.  The battles are bloody and personal, and the hardships of soldiers without enough to eat or ammunition to fire takes a toll on everyone.  Without hope of winning or even of staying alive, the brother's unit struggles with their role in the war.However, the realism is just a setting for a melodramatic story.  The older brother, Jin-tae, has an almost magical power to run through hails of enemy bullets without suffering so much as a scratch while people die around him.  The two brothers also have time during even the thickest and bloodiest fighting to scream at each other and deliver long speeches.  I don't mind a bit of melodrama, which is typical of Asian cinema, but sometimes belief is stretched to far, and you just have to shout ""Come on! There is no way they could still be alive!""",4,Love is a battlefield,1233705600,"02 4, 2009",2009,3538,"['One', 'things', 'love', 'watching', 'foreign-language', 'war', 'films', 'perspective', 'offer', 'only', 'American', 'films', 'see', 'single', 'perspective', 'generally', 'clear-cut', 'lines', 'what', 'side', 'are', 'rooting', 'films', 'likeHeaven', 'EarthandLetters', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'have', 'tried', 'offer', 'more', 'balanced', 'point', 'view', 'are', 'ultimately', 'still', 'American', 'films', 'made', 'American', 'audience', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'thing', 'watchingBattle', 'Okinawaand', 'getting', 'entirely', 'Japanese', 'perspective.Case', 'point', 'Growing', 'up', 'onM*A*S*HI', 'had', 'idea', 'Korean', 'War', 'was', 'fought', 'entirely', 'Americans', 'actual', 'Koreans', 'only', 'showing', 'up', 'time', 'time', 'comedy', 'relief', 'plot', 'device', 'was', 'conflict', 'had', 'never', 'given', 'much', 'thought', 'seemed', 'easy', 'war', 'Brotherhood', 'Taegukgi', 'Hwinalrimyeo', 'loosely', 'Flag', 'Korea', 'Yin', 'Yang', 'up', 'Flag', 'Korea', 'Brotherhood', 'War', 'immediately', 'misperceptions', 'leaving', 'now', 'Korean', 'war', 'was', 'fought', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'Koreans', 'American', 'army', 'only', 'fringes', 'lingering', 'faint', 'hope', 'rescue', 'military', 'power', 'embattled', 'troops.The', 'story', 'basic', 'set', 'up', 'two', 'brothers', 'being', 'involuntarily', 'drafted', 'South', 'Korean', 'army', 'are', 'good-natured', 'country', 'folk', 'family', 'true', 'loves', 'younger', 'brother', 'Jin-seok', 'Lee', 'Bin', 'WonGuns', 'Talks', 'family', 'hope', 'college', 'bound', 'good', 'academic', 'record', 'Jin-seok', 'forcibly', 'taken', 'army', 'older', 'brother', 'Jin-tae', 'Lee', 'Dong-Kun', 'JangThe', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'as', 'well', 'protect', 'younger', 'brother', 'hopefully', 'secure', 'release', 'Jin-tae', 'told', 'one', 'commanding', 'officers', 'can', 'win', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'bravery', 'younger', 'brother', 'would', 'be', 'allowed', 'go', 'home', 'win', 'medal', 'Jin-tae', 'transforms', 'veritable', 'God', 'War', 'volunteering', 'dangerous', 'mission', 'facing', 'danger', 'soon', 'becomes', 'seduced', 'own', 'reputation', 'enjoying', 'being', 'national', 'hero', 'showing', 'pleasure', 'killing', 'enemy', 'Jin-seok', 'tortured', 'older', 'brother', 'transformation', 'not', 'want', 'freedom', 'bought', 'cost', 'so', 'many', 'lives', 'brother', 'are', 'other', 'subplots', 'Jin-tae', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'left', 'behind', 'Jin-seok', 'friend', 'fighting', 'other', 'side', 'Betrayal', 'political', 'suspicion', 'lurk', 'background', 'story', 'Jin-tae', 'unsuspected', 'turns', 'ultimately', 'title', 'tale', 'two', 'brothers.As', 'war', 'flick', 'Brotherhood', 'line', 'modern', 'realistic', 'films', 'show', 'ravages', 'horror', 'combat', 'classic', 'flicks', 'showcase', 'feats', 'heroism', 'thick', 'emotion', 'battles', 'are', 'bloody', 'personal', 'hardships', 'soldiers', 'enough', 'eat', 'ammunition', 'fire', 'toll', 'everyone', 'hope', 'winning', 'even', 'staying', 'alive', 'brother', 'unit', 'role', 'war.However', 'realism', 'just', 'setting', 'melodramatic', 'story', 'older', 'brother', 'Jin-tae', 'almost', 'magical', 'power', 'run', 'hails', 'enemy', 'bullets', 'suffering', 'so', 'much', 'scratch', 'people', 'die', 'two', 'brothers', 'also', 'have', 'time', 'even', 'thickest', 'bloodiest', 'fighting', 'scream', 'other', 'deliver', 'long', 'speeches', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'bit', 'melodrama', 'typical', 'Asian', 'cinema', 'sometimes', 'belief', 'stretched', 'far', 'just', 'have', 'shout', 'Come', 'way', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'alive']",Tae Guk Gi - The Brotherhood of War
