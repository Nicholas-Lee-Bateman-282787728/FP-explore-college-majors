In most cases where film depicts true life, the film story is more sensualized.  But here, according to reports of the true incident, the real life ""Affair of the Abandoned Children of Sugamo."" is much more grim.Nobody Knows, filmed in 2004, takes place in Japan where a young mother of four tells the children she is out of town working and leaves the children to fend for themselves, for months or forever.  Initially, mother and eldest son rent an apartment, but she sneaks the other children into the apartment. The other three are never to go outside, nor attend school.  She tramps around, then leaves.From a Boy to a Man to a Boy to a ManThe pre-teen boy is suddenly thrust into manhood, as we see him dutifully budget the money left to him, paying rent, buying food.  He is the man of the house, until temptations of childhood take over and as a young boy indulges on games and nonsense with friends.  Then, as the money and friends go, he tries to earn money to support his siblings, the role of a man.Although the movie is 2 1/2 hours long, the pace slow; it is necessary to depict the length of time these children are alone, fending for themselves.  Some feel it could have been cut considerably.  Dialogue is minimal and soundtrack low key.  It won several awards.What is depicted in the film does not ring true to ""survival."" We get the feeling that their life is not in too much despair.  The children do not appear ""neglected"" and it doesn't quite come across as months of solitude without proper supervision and care.

921175,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B000A5044C,Amit Talpade,"[1, 1]","Nobody Knows is a film by Kore-Eda Hirokazu. It is about how some parents are horrible towards their children and although their children are resilient they are still children after all. A single mother to four children Keiko has been kicked out of several apartments or perhaps keeps on changing her addresses. She comes to a new town with the oldest to a apartment with the two other ones in suitcases. They start living in this apartment with rules no loud noises, no school for the oldest two. Only the oldest boy gets to run all the errands. The mother is notable for her absences sometimes disappearing for a few days. One day she disappears for good and the children are left to fend for themselves. The resourcefulness of the oldest boy soon comes in to play but only for a short time until things start turning bleak. With no money to pay bills, the water is cut, they have no gas and ultimately no food. The ending is tragic and depressing and lingers in your mind. This is because it is based on a true story which happened in Japan and was more gruesome than the retelling on screen.  I gave it four stars.

It's a harrowing tale, all the more so because it's based on real events.  The script is subtle and well-played by the actors.  You learn, for example, that  Mom's brood comes from four different fathers, none Nobel Prize winners.  In one telling sequence of scenes, the two candidates (a Pachinko gallery worker and taxi driver) who potentially sired the littlest daughter both try to distance themselves from any sense of responsibility.If you read between the lines at some of the critics' reviews (""unfolds with leisurely beauty"") of ""Nobody Knows,"" what you'll divine is that the film is overly long by about 20 - 30 minutes.  It could have used a good editor.  And, this is one of those movies where you watch and say to each other ""okay, good rental, but I'd be perturbed if I paid $8.50 a ticket at the theater.""That aside, the acting by the four child protagonists is at a very high level, especially that Yya Yagira, who portrays the eldest son; you can literally see the wight of responsibility eating away at this kid as the movie progresses.

921178,A3SGR43RE8FJ8C,B000A5044C,Count Zero,"[8, 9]","Kore-eda's achievement in this film is startling. This is film art grounded in the minimalist traditions of the Ozu school of Japanese filmmaking; leisurely story development, very little camera movement, minimal dialogue, perfectly-pitched performances from the actors. It references much of the best of contemporary Japanese cinema; the abused outcast child seen in Village of Dreams, the rites-of-passage trials in Firefly Dreams, the pagan rituals exhibited in Swallowtail. And yet, added to these elements, is a devastating critique of the anomie afflicting contemporary Japanese society. In recent years we have heard stories of a child found dead in a box in a residential area, a young woman kidnapped and held in a house between the ages of nine and nineteen, children suffocating in a car while their parents play pachinko, and a mother and son who starved to death in the middle of Tokyo because they were too proud to ask for welfare. The film is based on one true story, but I was reminded of all of these stories while viewing. All of these incidents happened in heavily-populated areas, but nobody knew. It is quite a feat that the director manages to indict more than the damaged, neglectful mother; the disinterested neighbours (always shot in an alienating manner, lower-body only or head turned away), the landlord, the utility companies, the convenience store clerks who fail to act. This film fuses social criticism with a beautiful cinematic aesthetic, and it will resonate long beyond the contemporary issues it addresses.",5,"bleak, affecting, beautiful",1137974400,"01 23, 2006",2006,1545,"['Kore-eda', 'achievement', 'film', 'startling', 'film', 'art', 'grounded', 'minimalist', 'traditions', 'Ozu', 'school', 'Japanese', 'filmmaking', 'leisurely', 'story', 'development', 'very', 'little', 'camera', 'movement', 'minimal', 'dialogue', 'perfectly-pitched', 'performances', 'actors', 'much', 'best', 'contemporary', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'abused', 'outcast', 'child', 'seen', 'Village', 'Dreams', 'rites-of-passage', 'trials', 'Firefly', 'Dreams', 'pagan', 'rituals', 'exhibited', 'Swallowtail', 'yet', 'added', 'elements', 'devastating', 'critique', 'anomie', 'afflicting', 'contemporary', 'Japanese', 'society', 'recent', 'years', 'have', 'heard', 'stories', 'child', 'found', 'dead', 'box', 'residential', 'area', 'young', 'woman', 'kidnapped', 'held', 'house', 'ages', 'nine', 'nineteen', 'children', 'suffocating', 'car', 'parents', 'play', 'pachinko', 'mother', 'son', 'who', 'starved', 'death', 'middle', 'Tokyo', 'were', 'too', 'proud', 'ask', 'welfare', 'film', 'based', 'one', 'true', 'story', 'was', 'reminded', 'stories', 'viewing', 'incidents', 'happened', 'heavily-populated', 'areas', 'nobody', 'knew', 'quite', 'feat', 'director', 'indict', 'more', 'damaged', 'neglectful', 'mother', 'disinterested', 'neighbours', 'always', 'shot', 'alienating', 'manner', 'lower-body', 'only', 'head', 'turned', 'away', 'landlord', 'utility', 'companies', 'convenience', 'store', 'clerks', 'who', 'fail', 'act', 'film', 'social', 'criticism', 'beautiful', 'cinematic', 'aesthetic', 'will', 'resonate', 'long', 'contemporary', 'issues']",Nobody Knows

The few minutes we meet the mom, Keiko, early in the film would not discourage that idea. After Keiko moves her family into a new apartment she gives them several rules: only Akira can go outside, none of them will go to school, and no loud noises, lest they be evicted. Then she leaves, and but for Akira's savvy they are on their own. How could she possibly leave? Will she return? Where did she go? Nobody knows. Akira shops, cooks, banks at the ATM, tracks down his dad to beg for money, and cares for his siblings, as we watch the sad and inevitable meltdown of the four children.

The young lead in the film, named Akira, a 12 yo boy [current age 22 at the time of this review] and played by Yuya Yojira won the best actor award at the 2004 Cannes film festival for his performance in this film as he should have. But all of his supporting cast were equally good.  The story concerns the abandonment of 4 children Akira, age 12, his sister Kyoko [played by Ayu Kitaura] about 11, Yuki [played by Momoko Shimizu], his five yo sister, and Shigeru played by Hiei Kimura] about Yuki's age in the film.  Their young mother Keiko Fukishima, played by the well known actress YOU, is a typical irresponsible parent, who has four kids by several men, but is looking to find love and happiness elsewhere without the obligations of taking care of her young family.  Through various periods of abandonment by the mother which becomes final abandonment, although she sends money earned from her various dalliances occasionally, it is never enough.  Therefore, the care of his family is placed upon the young Akira, who is a mere 12yo child himself and he along with his siblings are forced to refrain from formal schooling so no one will discover their true plight.  He finds young love with a cute school girl Saki [touchingly played by Hanae Kan], about his age, yet his youth is stymied by being thrust into an adult role way before he should take on such burdens for himself let alone three younger siblings.  Because no one is to find out about the mother's absence she sneaks them into a new apartment, the two youngest in suitcases, and says that only Akira is to show himself, of child welfare might come and take them away. He gets involved with the typical street kids and throughout one has a foreboding of tragedy about to strike.The story is touching, but depressing, and yet you can't divert your eyes from the drama unfolding before them. This is one film in which the suspension of disbelief is total due to all facets of its production.

921186,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000A5044C,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","'Dare mo shiranai' (NOBODY KNOWS) is a gleaming little film by writer/director Hirokazu Koreeda that offers a version of a true story so simply and eloquently that by the end of the film the audience is powerfully moved - without gimmicks, without imitation emotional devices, without major stars. It just simply works.  Though the film is long at 2 1/2 hours the journey is well worth it and indeed the prolonged length seems necessary to convey the plight of these touching children's plight.The film opens (during the titles) on public transportation where a youthful mother Keiko (the pop star You) and her young son Akira (Yya Yagira) sit guarding an ugly pink suitcase and other bags. Keira and Keiko have rented a poor little apartment promising the landlord that Keiko will make no noise. Once inside their new home the ugly bags are open and two additional children emerge and a trip to the bus station adds yet a third child!  Thus, 'unknown' to the landlord, the apartment contains a family of five!  Soon Keiko leaves on a trip to 'make money', leaving some cash with Akira who is placed in charge of his brother and sisters.  Of course, Keiko doesn't return except for one brief visit months later, and leaving the children to fend for themselves.Akira manages to make friends outside, gaining food and money for good deeds and good will, keeping his little 'family' afloat.  Gradually Akira realizes that Keiko will never return and through his friendship with a young girl still manages to eek out an existence: the manner in which he keeps his family happy is food for the soul!  But despite his constant good intentions to maintain a life for his family, one of his sisters dies and he and his girl friend bury her where she can 'watch the airplanes'.  And life goes on. There is no ending depicted, just continuum.With the subtlest technique Koreeda creates a story so real  that it pulsates.  The child actors (especially Yya Yagira) are  so natural and fine that they grab our hearts tenaciously. The only music in this film is a few notes form a toy piano and quiet harp music that enhances the feeling of isolation of the children.  This is a film of rare beauty, one that could have been edited a bit, but even that criticism is overshadowed by the impact of  Hirokazu Koreeda's overall achievement.  Very Highly Recommended.

I think it is good for kids to realise that this happens and once they are aware that not everyone can go to school when they want to, or not everyone has parents, I think it can bring up some healthy discussions. It is also a must see for parents, it is not overdramatised and really gives you a sense of what kids feel when they are abandoned and how we as a community can try to watch out for kids in trouble- not only our own.This movie is so powerful and focuses on the positive things the oldest boy of 4 siblings did to keep his family going once his mother abandoned them. They were able to survive for almost 6 months without anyone seeming to notice their showers in the park and not going to school.In the true story which you can find some information about (in Japanese) on the internet (Asahi newspaper story 1988) which paints a much darker picture of the actual events which are never represented in the movie. For example, as far as I can tell, the oldest son actually beat the youngest girl because he thought she ate the last of the food and she died from the beating- a very different story occurs in the movie. The mother also had killed one of the children in an accident involving hiding him in a suitcase (so there were originally 6 kids according to the papers).However, the director and script writers chose only to portray the oldest son's character as a struggling, but protective one- I guess they decided it made a better movie, but the fact that he stuck around and did not abandon his brothers and sisters despite being the most capable and able to survive on his own, is truly representative of his good character which was well represented in the movie. One thing I wish they had added at the end of the film was some kind of summation of what happened to the kids like many movies based on real stories do, I think many viewers want to know if the kids are now doing okay, in foster care or whatever happened to them in the end.You can read and join in on a discussion of this film and the issues surrounding it (in English) among parents living in Japan at my blog &lt;A HREF=""[...]"">hiroshimaoyako&lt;/A>",5,Good to watch if parenting in or out of Japan,1146268800,"04 29, 2006",2006,2385,"['issues', 'movie', 'are', 'relevant', 'parents', 'kids', 'anywhere-', 'son', '5', 'intend', 'watch', 'not', 'something', 'better', 'out', 'then', 'when', 'around', '10', 'be', 'able', 'discuss', 'issues', 'think', 'good', 'kids', 'realise', 'once', 'are', 'aware', 'not', 'everyone', 'can', 'go', 'school', 'when', 'want', 'not', 'everyone', 'parents', 'think', 'can', 'bring', 'up', 'healthy', 'discussions', 'also', 'must', 'see', 'parents', 'not', 'overdramatised', 'really', 'sense', 'what', 'kids', 'feel', 'when', 'are', 'abandoned', 'how', 'community', 'can', 'try', 'watch', 'out', 'kids', 'trouble-', 'not', 'only', 'own.This', 'movie', 'so', 'powerful', 'positive', 'things', 'oldest', 'boy', '4', 'siblings', 'did', 'keep', 'family', 'going', 'once', 'mother', 'abandoned', 'were', 'able', 'survive', 'almost', '6', 'months', 'anyone', 'seeming', 'notice', 'showers', 'park', 'not', 'going', 'school.In', 'true', 'story', 'can', 'find', 'information', 'Japanese', 'internet', 'Asahi', 'newspaper', 'story', '1988', 'much', 'darker', 'picture', 'actual', 'events', 'are', 'never', 'represented', 'movie', 'example', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'oldest', 'son', 'actually', 'beat', 'youngest', 'girl', 'thought', 'ate', 'last', 'food', 'died', 'beating-', 'very', 'different', 'story', 'movie', 'mother', 'also', 'had', 'killed', 'one', 'children', 'accident', 'involving', 'hiding', 'suitcase', 'were', 'originally', '6', 'kids', 'according', 'papers', '.However', 'director', 'script', 'writers', 'chose', 'only', 'portray', 'oldest', 'son', 'character', 'struggling', 'protective', 'one-', 'guess', 'decided', 'made', 'better', 'movie', 'fact', 'stuck', 'around', 'did', 'not', 'abandon', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'being', 'most', 'capable', 'able', 'survive', 'own', 'truly', 'representative', 'good', 'character', 'was', 'well', 'represented', 'movie', 'One', 'thing', 'wish', 'had', 'added', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'kind', 'summation', 'what', 'happened', 'kids', 'many', 'movies', 'based', 'real', 'stories', 'do', 'think', 'many', 'viewers', 'want', 'know', 'kids', 'are', 'now', 'doing', 'okay', 'foster', 'care', 'happened', 'end.You', 'can', 'read', 'join', 'discussion', 'film', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'English', 'parents', 'living', 'Japan', 'blog', 'lt', 'HREF=', '[', ']', '>', 'hiroshimaoyako', 'lt', '>']",Nobody Knows

For this film never cues the audience with big emotional sequences.  Instead, it relies on a dignity and intelligence that builds real suspense and genuine involvement--you become invested in the children's plight simply because you are asked to live it with them.The film begins as a young single mother, apparently evicted from her last residence, moves into a new apartment with her 12 year old son Akira.  After dealing with her new landlord, they start unpacking.  In the process, two young children are revealed to have been hiding in the luggage, and an older sister is subsequently snuck into the apartment late at night.  With 5 of them living in the space, the ground rules are set.  Akira is the only one that is to leave the apartment, the others are to remain silent and unseen.  It quickly becomes clear that Akira is the primary caregiver, and as time goes on the mother becomes less present.  Leaving money, she starts leaving for weeks or months at a time (for job and boyfriend) only to return as if nothing is out of the ordinary.  And then....she simply doesn't return at all.Again, the effectiveness of ""Nobody Knows"" is the way it quietly builds in intensity.  As Akira and his siblings adjust to a new form of existence, there are no histrionics--no emotional grandstanding.  No, it's just kids who are resilient--who do what they need to do.  And while some may claim that the film's length or pacing is problematic, I found that the time spent was well justified.  We are with the kids on every step of the journey--from their denial, to their acceptance, to their liberation from the rules, their struggles and successes.  It can be sad, to be sure, but it is never less than honest.Grounding the production is Yuya Yagira as Akira.  In an incredibly natural and dignified performance, we see a true portrait of a child wizened beyond his years.  Caring for the family, being the provider--Yagira conveys the emotional complexity of his position.  You understand and respect Akira, even when he faces some decisions no one should have to face.  Yagira won the Best Actor prize at Cannes for his astute performance.  ""Nobody Knows"" is recommended for serious, adult minded viewers.  Not always easy entertainment, this great film strives and achieves so much more.

921198,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000A5044C,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 1]","The most heart wrenching Japanese movie I have seen to date is Isao Takahata's anime ""Hotaru no haka"" (""Grave of the Fireflies"").  Once a year I steel myself to watch it again, even though doing so is as painful as the first time.  ""Dare mo shiranai"" (""Nobody Knows"") is almost as painful and the two narratives have much in common.  Director Hirokazu Koreeda's film tells the story of 12-year-old Akira (Yya Yagira) and his three younger siblings, Kyoko (Ayu Kitaura), Shigeru (Hiei Kimura), and Yuki (Momoko Shimizu) after their mother (You), abandons them in a tiny Tokyo apartment.When we first meet this family the mother and the two oldest children are moving into the apartment, carrying heavy suitcases.  Inside are the two younger children and this comic beginning to the film only sets up the tragedy to come.  The mother smiles too much and we quickly pick up that she is not to be trusted.  Akira has already learned this hard lesson, along with the guiding rule of their lives: do not let anybody know about the two younger children.  When the mother disappears, this rule and Akira's fear that the authorities will break up their unhappy family, keeps him from seeking help when the money runs out, the power is shut off in the apartment, and the children are starting to starve.  But there is always food being thrown out at a local sushi restaurant and ways of getting desperately needed medicine.This story of ""Dare mo shiranai"" is based on a true story, but as far as I know that is only to the extent that there really were young kids trying to living on their own after they were abandoned by their mother.  I do not think Koreeda is following the particulars of that case.  But knowing that is important because we have to accept that these children have become invisible to the adult world, which is exactly what the title assures us.  So nobody notice, even though we have reason to believe the rent has not been paid on the apartment and the stench must be getting noticeable to others in the building.  That is why the true horror of this film is that their situation continues unabated and that beyond the pivotal tragedy in the final act the final shot of the film is really the most horrific moment of all.This 2005 film runs 141 minutes but there is a rationale to what might be considered an excessive length because it gives a palatable weight to the long time these kids are left on their own.  Yagira won the award for Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival, and his performance hinges on the look on his face and in his eyes as we fill in the silence with what we think must be going through his mind.  Consequently, a lot of the credit must go to Koreeda, who constructs such meaning for us in our own minds from what we seen on the screen.  There are some points in which Koreeda overplays his hand.  One is the character of young Saki (Hanae Kan), who takes an interest in Akira and whose solution to the plight of the children is different (I feel that I do not know enough about what poverty is like in Tokyo today to understand the point of this plot development).  The other is that when Akira finds an hour or two to live the life of a normal boy his age that fate finds a way to punish his brief moments of happiness.  Koreeda's strength is in his depiction of the quiet moments of desperation for these children as he shows a world where being allowed to wear a pair of squeaky shoes is a great gift and running out of coins while being on hold is a living nightmare.",5,Four abandoned children try to survive on their own in a small Tokyo apartment,1126828800,"09 16, 2005",2005,3511,"['most', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'date', 'Isao', 'Takahata', 'anime', 'Hotaru', 'haka', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'Once', 'year', 'steel', 'watch', 'again', 'even', 'doing', 'so', 'as', 'painful', 'first', 'time', 'Dare', 'mo', 'shiranai', 'Nobody', 'Knows', 'almost', 'painful', 'two', 'narratives', 'have', 'much', 'common', 'Director', 'Hirokazu', 'Koreeda', 'film', 'story', '12-year-old', 'Akira', 'Yya', 'Yagira', 'three', 'younger', 'siblings', 'Kyoko', 'Ayu', 'Kitaura', 'Shigeru', 'Hiei', 'Kimura', 'Yuki', 'Momoko', 'Shimizu', 'mother', 'tiny', 'Tokyo', 'apartment.When', 'first', 'meet', 'family', 'mother', 'two', 'oldest', 'children', 'are', 'moving', 'apartment', 'carrying', 'heavy', 'suitcases', 'Inside', 'are', 'two', 'younger', 'children', 'comic', 'beginning', 'film', 'only', 'up', 'tragedy', 'come', 'mother', 'too', 'much', 'quickly', 'pick', 'up', 'not', 'be', 'trusted', 'Akira', 'already', 'learned', 'hard', 'lesson', 'guiding', 'rule', 'lives', 'do', 'not', 'let', 'anybody', 'know', 'two', 'younger', 'children', 'When', 'mother', 'rule', 'Akira', 'fear', 'authorities', 'will', 'break', 'up', 'unhappy', 'family', 'seeking', 'help', 'when', 'money', 'out', 'power', 'shut', 'off', 'apartment', 'children', 'are', 'starting', 'starve', 'always', 'food', 'being', 'thrown', 'out', 'local', 'sushi', 'restaurant', 'ways', 'getting', 'desperately', 'needed', 'medicine.This', 'story', 'Dare', 'mo', 'shiranai', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'only', 'extent', 'really', 'were', 'young', 'kids', 'trying', 'living', 'own', 'were', 'abandoned', 'mother', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Koreeda', 'following', 'particulars', 'case', 'knowing', 'important', 'have', 'accept', 'children', 'have', 'become', 'invisible', 'adult', 'world', 'exactly', 'what', 'title', 'nobody', 'notice', 'even', 'have', 'reason', 'believe', 'rent', 'not', 'been', 'paid', 'apartment', 'stench', 'must', 'be', 'getting', 'noticeable', 'others', 'building', 'why', 'true', 'horror', 'film', 'situation', 'unabated', 'pivotal', 'tragedy', 'final', 'act', 'final', 'shot', 'film', 'really', 'most', 'horrific', 'moment', 'all.This', '2005', 'film', '141', 'minutes', 'rationale', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'excessive', 'length', 'palatable', 'weight', 'long', 'time', 'kids', 'are', 'left', 'own', 'Yagira', 'won', 'award', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'performance', 'hinges', 'look', 'face', 'eyes', 'fill', 'silence', 'what', 'think', 'must', 'be', 'going', 'mind', 'Consequently', 'lot', 'credit', 'must', 'go', 'Koreeda', 'who', 'such', 'meaning', 'own', 'minds', 'what', 'seen', 'screen', 'are', 'points', 'Koreeda', 'hand', 'One', 'character', 'young', 'Saki', 'Hanae', 'Kan', 'who', 'interest', 'Akira', 'solution', 'plight', 'children', 'different', 'feel', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'enough', 'what', 'poverty', 'Tokyo', 'today', 'understand', 'point', 'plot', 'development', 'other', 'when', 'Akira', 'hour', 'two', 'live', 'life', 'normal', 'boy', 'age', 'fate', 'way', 'punish', 'brief', 'moments', 'happiness', 'Koreeda', 'strength', 'depiction', 'quiet', 'moments', 'desperation', 'children', 'world', 'where', 'being', 'allowed', 'wear', 'pair', 'squeaky', 'shoes', 'great', 'gift', 'running', 'out', 'coins', 'being', 'hold', 'living', 'nightmare']",Nobody Knows

921200,A22RE7V8QZFICW,B000A5044C,Lizard,"[10, 37]","Supposedly based on fact, we have a irresponsible mother who has four children all from different fathers, and abandons their kids to persue another relationship (the mom even tells the eldest son she never mentioned her kids to him, and tells him he is being selfish not thinking of her happiness). She eventually never returns, and the four children are left to their own devices to stay alive. The eldest son visits his irresponsible dad needing money but explains he has none having to spend lots on his present girlfriend. Nice guy...The only problem with this film is not once have the children cried or showed much emotions. You would think-even small kids, would miss their only parent. There are many times I thought the film dragged. None of the neighbors in the apartment noticed something funny going on--where's the mother? (in Japan living quarters are cramped and neighbors are very close by). The water and electricity was cut off. With four children in the apartment, wouldn't they notice the smell (none of the kids kept house clean-it was a pig sty in there).Even when one of the children had an accident, fell off a chair, and eventually died-not one sibling cried or even thought about getting help, which would be a natural reaction. They just sat around and watched her die. The eldest son put her body in a suitcase and buried it at some airport. mmmm this girl shows up near the end of the show--supposedly becomes friends with the eldest son, and she helps do the deed of burying sister's corpse. Personally I think this lack of emotion is appalling. Why didn't she tell the authorities when she seen how they lived?An employee at a grocer asked the eldest son...""why haven't you called the authorities."" Eldest son replied he didn't want the family to be separated. I guess he preferred to watch his siblings live in dirt and filth, slowly starve to death, not get an education, and die off. ANd with the lack of emotion with all chidren when their sister died, it made me wonder how on earth this film won the 2004 Cannes International Film Festival award.Also unrealistic is how did the eldest son pay rent-sure the mother sometimes (extremely rarely) sent money, and it goes fast with four kids. During one scene the landlord's (or his daughter, i forgot which) was asking for rent money. Then all of the sudden rent was no longer an issue. I don't care where you live--RENT IS NOT CHEAP. In real life the landlord would have started eviction procedures. Also the landlord said nothing of the trash and filth all over the apartment when she came to visit, and she CLEARLY seen how the apartment looks like.  A REAL landlord would have been livid. Eviction process.I know all the critics gave it rave reviews, but I'm telling you my honest opinion of the movie--it was slow, and far from realistic in the midst of child abandonment and how the children would react to that, and the general lack of pure emotion (nobody cried) impossible to grasp.This is NOT a movie I would want to see twice, but okay to rent.

921205,A13DQTXG02HZC1,B000A5044C,Ping Lim,"[4, 5]","By now, all readers should have a good idea of what this movie is all about, an observation of how four siblings (same mother but different fathers) carried on living when they were all but forgotten by their mother.  Whilst some viewers might think that the mother was self-centred and callous, thinking of her own pursuit of happiness, this movie pointed straight to the social issues that Japan is facing right now.  True, Japan is an industrialised nation and it has a high standard of living.  Nonetheless, it doesn't imply that the Japanese's quality of life is moving on-par with the standard.  Rather, people are slaving away and minding their own business or that people are verging towards extremism.  It's ultimately survival of the fittest and everyone is there fending for themselves.  Viewers shall see for themselves the superficial politeness that Japanese is known for in this movie.  One would think that the neighbours of those siblings would have noticed of their unkempt appearances and them hanging around when they should be attending schools but they were pretty much left to their own devices.  Then, there's the character of Saki, a senior high school student that befriended the four siblings.  She's been regarded as an 'outsider' by her peers and as a result, she's hanging around in the park to kill time and giving her parents the impression that she's still going to school.  Shouldn't the parents play their part in knowing their own children intimately and caring for their emotional well-being instead of simply catering for their physical well-being?  Thus, many cases of 'hikikomori' situation in Japan where children tend to lose themselves in their own room for years...On top of that, there's Saki again dating older business man to make money for the four siblings.  Remember, everything we saw in this movie was based upon true events!  Overall, this is an unforced movie that slowly unfolds itself and gradually, we get to empathise with the siblings and the plight that they were in.  The theme song in the end really striked it to the core of the matter, that there wasn't really a light at the end of the tunnel and people like those children were really the lost souls or abandoned souls of Japan.  Could those four children and Saki, and even their mother (played by You, a J-Pop singer) represent the fate of the delinquent and rebellious youngsters of modern-day Japan and is there a future for them under the new Koizumi government?  Thus, the movie ending with an open-ended format.  Lest Japan forget...Unforgettable experience and outstanding performances from all cast.  Highly recommended and not to be missed.

921206,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000A5044C,Roland E. Zwick,"[7, 9]","****1/2Keiko is a single mother living with her four children (all from different fathers) in a cramped apartment she's recently rented in a middle class section of Tokyo.  Fearful that they will be thrown out onto the streets if the neighbors or landlord discover the existence of the kids, she makes the three youngest ones stay indoors and out of sight while the oldest, 12-year-old Akira, is allowed to venture out to run errands and enjoy at least some semblance of a normal life.  None of the children attend school.  Despite his youth, Akira, in many ways, has been forced to assume the role of parent, providing for the other children while Keiko stays away for months at a time, ostensibly earning money working (though we are inclined to speculate that there may be a far more nefarious truth behind the absences that is never fully revealed to us).Based on a true story, ""Nobody Knows"" is more of an observational study on human behavior than a full-fledged narrative; it is a film that uses the minutiae of everyday life, rather than heavy-handed plot points, to generate its drama.  As virtual prisoners in their own apartment, the children survive as best they can without adult supervision or guidance.  Indeed, in its own quiet way, the film serves as an allegory of a much larger issue, a stinging indictment against a society that too often abandons and neglects its children to pursue its own selfish interests - most often to devastating and disastrous results both for the youngsters themselves and for the society as a whole.Beautifully written and directed by Hirokazu Koreeda, this is a heartrending film filled with moments of quiet perceptions and unforgettable images.  The actors portraying the children are all truly amazing - wholly natural, unaffected and believable in front of the camera.  Yuya Yagira, as young Akira, is basically called on here to carry the film and he does so in a way that leaves one awestruck and breathless.  His is an exquisitely internalized performance, serious and stoic on the outside, yet with a sly mischievousness that peeks through from time to time to remind us that Akira is really just a kid at heart, forced to grow up much too fast and assume the mantle of adult responsibility that the actual ""adults"" around him have been all too eager to abandon.  What's so heartbreaking about this film is watching these sweet (but never cloying) children being deprived of all the true essentials of a happy childhood - freedom, fresh air, open space, education, even food and electricity, not to mention the all-important feeling of security and belonging that comes with the love and guidance of a fully engaged parent.  Yet, although they yearn for all these things, the children seem to accept their plight with a sort of uncomplaining fatalism combined with a love of one another and a resourcefulness and spirit of survival that is both astonishing and inspiring.Nothing about ""Nobody Knows"" is ever obvious or underlined, not its message and certainly not its emotions.  These seep into the film gradually and unobtrusively so as not to disturb the near-documentary nature of the movie.  We feel almost as if we are eavesdropping on the children, as if we were the very neighbors from whom they are trying so desperately to hide.  There's no point in denying that the movie requires patience from the viewer, for it achieves its power subtly and slowly, through an artfully arranged accumulation of activities and details.  Yet, this is precisely what draws us into the world of the film and makes us, finally, not mere observers but rather empathetic participants with the characters.It takes time to get to where it's going, but ""Nobody Knows"" will leave an indelible mark on your heart.",4,"a memorable, moving Japanese film",1153353600,"07 20, 2006",2006,3755,"['****1/2Keiko', 'single', 'mother', 'living', 'four', 'children', 'different', 'fathers', 'cramped', 'apartment', 'recently', 'rented', 'middle', 'class', 'section', 'Tokyo', 'Fearful', 'will', 'be', 'thrown', 'out', 'streets', 'neighbors', 'landlord', 'existence', 'kids', 'three', 'youngest', 'ones', 'stay', 'indoors', 'sight', 'oldest', '12-year-old', 'Akira', 'allowed', 'venture', 'out', 'run', 'errands', 'enjoy', 'least', 'semblance', 'normal', 'life', 'None', 'children', 'attend', 'school', 'youth', 'Akira', 'many', 'ways', 'been', 'forced', 'assume', 'role', 'parent', 'providing', 'other', 'children', 'Keiko', 'away', 'months', 'time', 'ostensibly', 'earning', 'money', 'working', 'are', 'inclined', 'speculate', 'may', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'nefarious', 'truth', 'absences', 'never', 'fully', 'revealed', '.Based', 'true', 'story', 'Nobody', 'Knows', 'more', 'observational', 'study', 'human', 'behavior', 'full-fledged', 'narrative', 'film', 'minutiae', 'everyday', 'life', 'rather', 'heavy-handed', 'plot', 'points', 'generate', 'drama', 'virtual', 'prisoners', 'own', 'apartment', 'children', 'survive', 'can', 'adult', 'supervision', 'guidance', 'Indeed', 'own', 'quiet', 'way', 'film', 'allegory', 'much', 'larger', 'issue', 'stinging', 'indictment', 'society', 'too', 'often', 'abandons', 'children', 'pursue', 'own', 'selfish', 'interests', 'most', 'often', 'devastating', 'disastrous', 'results', 'youngsters', 'society', 'whole.Beautifully', 'written', 'directed', 'Hirokazu', 'Koreeda', 'heartrending', 'film', 'filled', 'moments', 'quiet', 'perceptions', 'unforgettable', 'images', 'actors', 'portraying', 'children', 'are', 'truly', 'amazing', 'wholly', 'natural', 'unaffected', 'believable', 'front', 'camera', 'Yuya', 'Yagira', 'young', 'Akira', 'basically', 'called', 'here', 'carry', 'film', 'so', 'way', 'one', 'awestruck', 'breathless', 'exquisitely', 'internalized', 'performance', 'serious', 'stoic', 'outside', 'yet', 'sly', 'mischievousness', 'time', 'time', 'remind', 'Akira', 'really', 'just', 'kid', 'heart', 'forced', 'grow', 'up', 'much', 'too', 'fast', 'assume', 'mantle', 'adult', 'responsibility', 'actual', 'adults', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'eager', 'abandon', 'What', 'so', 'heartbreaking', 'film', 'watching', 'sweet', 'never', 'cloying', 'children', 'being', 'deprived', 'true', 'essentials', 'happy', 'childhood', 'freedom', 'fresh', 'air', 'open', 'space', 'education', 'even', 'food', 'electricity', 'not', 'mention', 'all-important', 'feeling', 'security', 'belonging', 'love', 'guidance', 'fully', 'engaged', 'parent', 'yearn', 'things', 'children', 'seem', 'accept', 'plight', 'sort', 'uncomplaining', 'fatalism', 'combined', 'love', 'one', 'resourcefulness', 'spirit', 'survival', 'astonishing', 'inspiring.Nothing', 'Nobody', 'Knows', 'ever', 'obvious', 'underlined', 'not', 'message', 'certainly', 'not', 'emotions', 'seep', 'film', 'gradually', 'unobtrusively', 'so', 'not', 'disturb', 'near-documentary', 'nature', 'movie', 'feel', 'almost', 'are', 'eavesdropping', 'children', 'were', 'very', 'neighbors', 'whom', 'are', 'trying', 'so', 'desperately', 'hide', 'point', 'denying', 'movie', 'patience', 'viewer', 'power', 'subtly', 'slowly', 'artfully', 'arranged', 'accumulation', 'activities', 'details', 'Yet', 'precisely', 'what', 'world', 'film', 'finally', 'not', 'mere', 'observers', 'rather', 'empathetic', 'participants', 'characters.It', 'time', 'get', 'where', 'going', 'Nobody', 'Knows', 'will', 'leave', 'indelible', 'mark', 'heart']",Nobody Knows

921208,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B000A5044C,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[6, 7]","""Dare mo shiranai"" (Nobody Knows) by Kore-eda Hirokazu is all the more poignant for being based on a real-life scandal in Japan. In 1988, four children were found abandoned by their mother, living for six months in a squalid Tokyo apartment with no running water, electricity, or food, where one of the children, weakened by malnutrition, was accidentally killed.As the film begins, the family is moving into yet another apartment; they are continuously evicted for having too many children. The two youngest children arrive smuggled in suitcases, already a sign of the startling neglect to come, as the mother portrays this as a game. The hot, tired children unfold from their suitcase prisons as the mother laughs, claps her hands and tells them ""Good job!"" in her Minnie Mouse voice. The children's flighty mother is barely more than a child herself, unable to cope with real life and care for her large brood (each child has a different father).It is never explicitly stated what her job is, but she frequently leaves the children for long stretches of time, expecting eldest son Akira (Yuya Yagira) to care for ten-year-old Kyoko, seven-year-old Shigeru, and five-year-old Yuki. The children are like children everywhere: they long to play outside, be rambunctious, play in the park, be free to dream. Instead, they are virtual prisoners, unable to leave the apartment lest they be caught. Even the small balcony is off limits. Akira does all of the outside shopping, bill paying, and cooking. None of the children go to school. ""Why do you want to go to school?"" their mother asks. ""Famous people don't go to school."" Like who? Akira demands. His mother can't come up with a suitable answer.The inevitable happens: their mother is infatuated with the latest boyfriend, and skips town for good. Akira holds off telling the other children for as long as possible; after all, their mother is frequently gone for months at a time. He is forced to spend down, but it isn't enough. The utilities are eventually cut off, and the apartment descends into a pit of hell, with garbage covering everything. The children must use the bathroom in the park and wash their clothes in a fountain, and survive off of leftover sushi handouts. Akira falls in with a group of thug-like high schoolers who use him, taunt him, and try to get him to shoplift, and the youngest children suffer the most. Somber Kyoko taps out melodies on her toy piano, Shigeru breaks the rules by running wild outside, and Yuki colors and draws pictures that cover every inch of the apartment. Their situation becomes more and more dire; even though the landlord's wife has seen the state of the apartment, no social services are called in. The children are left to fester as their clothes unravel and they slowly succumb to malnutrition. An accident occurs, prompted out of boredom, that changes their close-knit lives. The ending is sparse, haunting, and we are not told what becomes of the children, or if their mother was ever found.The child actors were essentially filmed living in the apartment throughout an entire year of filming, so in some ways, ""Nobody Knows"" plays out like a documentary. The scene where they play in the park for the first time was really their first time leaving the apartment in months. It is heartwrenching to watch them spying on ""normal"" children down below, children who take school for granted, are allowed to ride bikes and play in the park. There is no creative outlet, no exercise, no nourishing food, and yet, although weakened, their spirits still demonstrate the resilience of childhood. Kore-eda's haunting portrait of solitude and survival at its darkest is difficult to watch, but worth the journey.",5,Haunting true-life drama of abandonment and the resilience of children,1134000000,"12 8, 2005",2005,3711,"['Dare', 'mo', 'shiranai', 'Nobody', 'Knows', 'Kore-eda', 'Hirokazu', 'more', 'poignant', 'being', 'based', 'real-life', 'scandal', 'Japan', '1988', 'four', 'children', 'were', 'found', 'abandoned', 'mother', 'living', 'six', 'months', 'squalid', 'Tokyo', 'apartment', 'running', 'water', 'electricity', 'food', 'where', 'one', 'children', 'weakened', 'malnutrition', 'was', 'accidentally', 'film', 'family', 'moving', 'yet', 'apartment', 'are', 'continuously', 'evicted', 'having', 'too', 'many', 'children', 'two', 'youngest', 'children', 'arrive', 'smuggled', 'suitcases', 'already', 'sign', 'startling', 'neglect', 'come', 'mother', 'game', 'hot', 'tired', 'children', 'unfold', 'suitcase', 'prisons', 'mother', 'hands', 'Good', 'job', 'Minnie', 'Mouse', 'voice', 'children', 'flighty', 'mother', 'barely', 'more', 'child', 'unable', 'cope', 'real', 'life', 'care', 'large', 'brood', 'child', 'different', 'father', '.It', 'never', 'explicitly', 'stated', 'what', 'job', 'frequently', 'children', 'long', 'stretches', 'time', 'expecting', 'eldest', 'son', 'Akira', 'Yuya', 'Yagira', 'care', 'ten-year-old', 'Kyoko', 'seven-year-old', 'Shigeru', 'five-year-old', 'Yuki', 'children', 'are', 'children', 'everywhere', 'long', 'play', 'outside', 'be', 'rambunctious', 'play', 'park', 'be', 'free', 'dream', 'Instead', 'are', 'virtual', 'prisoners', 'unable', 'leave', 'apartment', 'lest', 'be', 'caught', 'Even', 'small', 'balcony', 'limits', 'Akira', 'outside', 'shopping', 'bill', 'paying', 'cooking', 'None', 'children', 'go', 'school', 'Why', 'do', 'want', 'go', 'school', 'mother', 'Famous', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'school', 'who', 'Akira', 'mother', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'suitable', 'answer.The', 'inevitable', 'happens', 'mother', 'infatuated', 'latest', 'boyfriend', 'skips', 'town', 'good', 'Akira', 'telling', 'other', 'children', 'as', 'long', 'possible', 'mother', 'frequently', 'gone', 'months', 'time', 'forced', 'spend', 'down', ""n't"", 'enough', 'utilities', 'are', 'eventually', 'cut', 'off', 'apartment', 'pit', 'hell', 'garbage', 'covering', 'everything', 'children', 'must', 'use', 'bathroom', 'park', 'wash', 'clothes', 'fountain', 'survive', 'leftover', 'sushi', 'handouts', 'Akira', 'group', 'thug-like', 'high', 'schoolers', 'who', 'use', 'taunt', 'try', 'get', 'shoplift', 'youngest', 'children', 'suffer', 'most', 'Somber', 'Kyoko', 'out', 'melodies', 'toy', 'piano', 'Shigeru', 'rules', 'running', 'wild', 'outside', 'Yuki', 'colors', 'draws', 'pictures', 'cover', 'inch', 'apartment', 'situation', 'more', 'more', 'dire', 'even', 'landlord', 'wife', 'seen', 'state', 'apartment', 'social', 'services', 'are', 'called', 'children', 'are', 'left', 'fester', 'clothes', 'unravel', 'slowly', 'succumb', 'malnutrition', 'accident', 'occurs', 'prompted', 'boredom', 'close-knit', 'lives', 'ending', 'sparse', 'haunting', 'are', 'not', 'told', 'what', 'children', 'mother', 'was', 'ever', 'found.The', 'child', 'actors', 'were', 'essentially', 'filmed', 'living', 'apartment', 'entire', 'year', 'filming', 'so', 'ways', 'Nobody', 'Knows', 'out', 'documentary', 'scene', 'where', 'play', 'park', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'really', 'first', 'time', 'leaving', 'apartment', 'months', 'heartwrenching', 'watch', 'spying', 'normal', 'children', 'down', 'children', 'who', 'take', 'school', 'granted', 'are', 'allowed', 'ride', 'bikes', 'play', 'park', 'creative', 'outlet', 'exercise', 'nourishing', 'food', 'yet', 'weakened', 'spirits', 'still', 'demonstrate', 'resilience', 'childhood', 'Kore-eda', 'haunting', 'portrait', 'solitude', 'survival', 'darkest', 'difficult', 'watch', 'journey']",Nobody Knows

921211,A1XOHJLA16DPZT,B000A5044C,Steve Koss,"[5, 7]","Casual human indifference to the plight of others is one of the horror stories in modern urban life. Witness the now nearly mythic knife stabbing murder of Kitty Genovese in New York City, the multiple stories of parental neglect and social services failures in every major city, and most recently, the left behind victims of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. In NOBODY KNOWS, Hirokazu Kore-Eda presents a brilliantly understated but chilling tale of a society's indifference to its children.After an opening scene whose significance can only be understood at the movie's end, NOBODY KNOWS begins with the happy scene of a 12-year-old boy (Akiro) and his mother presenting a thank you gift to their new landlord, his wife, and their doe-eyed little dog. The landlord rather untactfully asks for Akiro's age and then comments that he doesn't rent to families with smaller children because they are too noisy. By the next scene, we are watching two small children, Shigeru and Yuki, tumble out of the suitcases in which their mother has smuggled them into the apartment. Still another daughter appears momentarily, and mom is soon surrounded by four children, all of whom we learn have different fathers, all absent. Mother appears to have both the voice and mental capacity of a ten-year-old, and after her first, one-month disappearance, she leaves a second time and never returns.Not surprisingly, the movie's central drama concerns the four children's ability to survive sans parents. They live first on money left for them by their mother, then from small offerings from two of their fathers, and then by Akira's wits. Oldest daughter Kyoko dreams of going to school and buying herself a piano, younger son Shigeru longs to play outdoors, and the youngest, Yuki, draws pictures until her crayons are mere nubs. At first, the children keep the apartment and themselves clean, but as time passes, everything deteriorates, including their health and their clothing. The four children's slow but steady decline into a state of near wildness is reminiscent of LORD OF THE FLIES, but without the internecine conflicts and war gaming. Even when an older girl, Saki, befriends Akira and his siblings, nothing seems to prevent their inevitable slide into a sort of urban savagery. Kore-Eda evokes palpable feelings of revulsion mixed with pity for the children and anger at every adult with whom they come into contact. We can only watch, horrified, as the children regress into mere shadows of their former selves, penniless, malnourished, and barely able to lift themselves from their mats on the floor until, finally, tragedy strikes.It is impossible not to see NOBODY KNOWS as an indictment of Japanese society as cold, self-centered, and uncaring. Kore-Eda's responsible adults take no notice of the children, even when they are brushing their teeth and washing their clothes in the faucet of a local public park. The only substantive assistance the kids receive comes from Saki and two young workers at a local food store, as if the older generations (the mother, the fathers, the landlord's wife, and even the electric company) are complete bereft of care or human decency. Curiously, somewhat the same critique of Japanese society emerges out of Haruki Murakami's documentary novel UNDERGROUND, which describes the serin gas attack in the Tokyo subway system.Fans of Kore-Eda's wonderful earlier movie, AFTER LIFE, will find NOBODY KNOWS to be a bleak but powerful tale of modern urban life.

921212,A14OB7YKMPBJLW,B000A5044C,Susan Fong,"[1, 2]","It is no surprise that the greatest contemporary movies no longer originate from the U.S.  Perhaps it's because most American filmmakers play it safe using recycled characters and plots because they are trying to please the studios. It's about big business which is why so many films seem like they were made on an assembly line. They're cost-efficient (supposedly), predictable, and indistinguishable from each other.That's why a quiet little masterpiece like director Kore-Eda Hirokazu's ""Nobody Knows"" could never be made in the United States.  It would be too ""risky"" of an investment since there are no big stars.  And the movie is preoccupied with the mundane tasks of everyday survival. There is no miraculous happy ending, nor are there any scenes loaded with special effects.That is the reason that this movie is so powerful, even devastating. It is about the realities that everyone of us face- the daily struggle to provide adequate food and shelter for our families, to pay the bills, and to protect our loved ones from harm.  In ""Nobody Knows"" these basic necessities become ever out of reach because they must be fulfilled by four young children with little or no help from adults.The movie takes its time in documenting the almost unimaginable challenges that these innocent kids face because their parents have abandoned them.  The adults that they do interact with are limited in the amount of help that they can offer. The movie is also a profound indictment of a rigidly structured and intolerant Japanese society where illegitimacy is treated as something so shameful that no one is supposed to know that illegitamite children even exist.Director Hirokazu never preaches nor overdramatizes the children's plight.  The children just do what they must do in order to survive.  The film is replete with remarkable naturalist acting especially from the film's youngest performers. They seem real enough to be your next-door neighbors.  And even in desperation, these brave children somehow manage to find simple joy and beauty in their harsh environment which makes their misfortunes almost unbearable to witness.""Nobody Knows"" is a masterpiece.  It is a deliberately paced, contemplative study of the struggle to live when tragedy and hardship strike.

Based loosely on an abandonment tragedy that occurred in the late 80s, it follows the lives of four children left to fend for themselves in a small Tokyo apartment.And it IS loosely based.  I've read some unfavorable reviews from people upset that the film didn't stay true to the original incident, but perhaps they expect too much.  ""Based on a true story"" has become one of the more annoying tags in cinematic advertising and lending it your faith while choosing a film is a mistake.  Had the real story never happened, this would simply be an unsettling, successful drama.  Judging it harshly because it doesn't mirror the original events isn't so much a review of the movie as it is a stab at cozen marketing.  This, to me, is a disservice.""Nobody Knows"" is a delicate, wonderfully acted film, and certainly worth what's being asked here.  The cinematography is minimalistic, highly effective, and the synergy between these child actors is remarkable.  I've read online that the director put massive efforts towards creating a realistic environment for these kids and it shows - the interactions felt very real.I think the only caution I'd air is that the stills used to advertise this film represent something a bit more pleasant than what's actually being delivered.  Not to say that this wasn't a rewarding viewing experience, but if you're looking for a feel-good film, you'll probably do well to move along.  While it's not as gruesome as the real incident, it definitely houses some sad days.I'd also advise that it's a long film - some 145 minutes.  My wife and I broke it in half over two nights and it worked out well.  That's still a bit long for my taste but we're glad we picked it up and we'll be watching it again.Thank you for your time.- t",4,"""I guess Yuki grew""",1348963200,"09 30, 2012",2012,1830,"['Nobody', 'Knows', '2004', 'Japanese', 'film', 'directed', 'Hirokazu', 'Koreeda', 'Based', 'loosely', 'abandonment', 'tragedy', 'occurred', 'late', '80s', 'lives', 'four', 'children', 'left', 'fend', 'small', 'Tokyo', 'apartment.And', 'loosely', 'based', ""'ve"", 'read', 'unfavorable', 'reviews', 'people', 'upset', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'stay', 'true', 'original', 'incident', 'perhaps', 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'become', 'one', 'more', 'annoying', 'tags', 'cinematic', 'advertising', 'lending', 'faith', 'choosing', 'film', 'mistake', 'Had', 'real', 'story', 'never', 'happened', 'would', 'simply', 'be', 'unsettling', 'successful', 'drama', 'Judging', 'harshly', ""n't"", 'mirror', 'original', 'events', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'review', 'movie', 'stab', 'cozen', 'marketing', 'disservice', 'Nobody', 'Knows', 'delicate', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'film', 'certainly', 'what', 'being', 'asked', 'here', 'cinematography', 'minimalistic', 'highly', 'effective', 'synergy', 'child', 'actors', 'remarkable', ""'ve"", 'read', 'online', 'director', 'put', 'massive', 'efforts', 'towards', 'creating', 'realistic', 'environment', 'kids', 'interactions', 'felt', 'very', 'real.I', 'think', 'only', 'caution', ""'d"", 'air', 'stills', 'used', 'advertise', 'film', 'represent', 'something', 'bit', 'more', 'pleasant', 'what', 'actually', 'being', 'delivered', 'Not', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'rewarding', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'re"", 'looking', 'feel-good', 'film', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'do', 'well', 'move', 'along', 'not', 'as', 'gruesome', 'real', 'incident', 'definitely', 'houses', 'sad', 'days.I', ""'d"", 'also', 'advise', 'long', 'film', '145', 'minutes', 'wife', 'broke', 'half', 'two', 'nights', 'worked', 'out', 'well', 'still', 'bit', 'long', 'taste', ""'re"", 'glad', 'picked', 'up', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'time.-', 't']",Nobody Knows

The father left a long time ago, the mother is an immature woman who is looking for self-fulfillment, no matter what the (family) cost. Without ever knowing what she really does for a living, the audience is led to face and (hopefully) bear her repetitive, largely unjustified and lengthy leaves from home, leaving her kids behind under the supervision of her oldest, teenage son. One day however, she fails to return and the kids are left alone with a handful of bank notes... and nobody to rely on.The movie follows a linear, chronological timeline, the shooting is clean and efficient, actors are top notch: the lead character, Yagira Yuuya, was actually crowned Best Male Actor at the 2004 Cannes ! Youngest ever!A special attention was brought by the director to accurately depicting feelings rather than thoughts in a brilliant attempt to stick to how kids actually live. As a result, the movie is more factual than anything else. Therefore, expect no judgment whatsoever on the mother: it's up to the audience to decide whether to hate or forgive her.Although it quickly becomes clear that a drama is unfolding, the audience is left in awe by the kids' resilience and extraordinary will to survive, building optimism. They simply never, ever give up! Makes grown-ups wonder: would I be able to do the same in their situation? There is nothing to throw away in this movie.

I'd make sure to go to real speed when it was obvious there was dialogue. I don't think I missed much as much of the movie is just microscopic observing day to day to day. It's like something you want to put in the oven to make it shrink whole. Terrific acting, a compelling story, very well made with nice cinematography, but what can I say, it was unbearably long, even in fast forward. Hey, I've got a life to live. I don't need to sit and have the poignant stretched out to almost 2 1/2 hours unnecessarily. I got it. The movie is long because it forces you to empathize with how their life is a long unbearable waiting. I got that at 4x speed, thank you. There's a great many long movies, longer than this one, which I love and don't feel the length unnecessary at all. I suppose every scene here is ""telling,"" but please, respect your audience. Give your audience more credit for picking up the nuances without having to make them stare at each one ten minutes at a time. Every little moment is not all that profound just because it is filmed well. The best way to say it is, it was overindulgent in the situation. The cutting room floor does have it valid purposes.I can only give this movie three stars simply because of the unbearable pace. Otherwise, everything else about it might have made it to 5, at least 4 stars. The boy did deserve his best actor award. I'll get a lot of negative ratings for this review. You always get many negative ratings of your review when you have something not particularly nice to say about a well made movie which a lot of people say they love. I suppose a lot of people think this movie is perfect. Is that true, or are you not being perfectly honest? The length experience is probably very subjective. I can say I watched a very good memorable film with lots of good memorable images and scenes, but it was so so very unnecessarily long in the watching. It's a bit of a paradox for me that way, but you have to be truthful in your reviews. It's a recommendable film, but with a huge warning--it's only for the most patient among us. Guess I didn't qualify.After you watch the film, do an online search for ""Affair of the four abandoned children of Sugamo"" which will turn up accounts of the real story the movie is ""based on."" The real story is a much grimmer reality than what this film depicts. That fact is quite revealing about the movie maker and his intentions. The disparity between the real story and the movie's story raises the question of when you can actually claim, ""based on a true story."" It'd be better to say something like, the idea was inspired by a true story, but apart from that, it's actually an entirely fictional creation with no intention of actually depicting the true story. The movie maker's made up world is a fundamentally different world created for his own purposes. Don't watch this film believing that it's documenting a true story. It's not. You can probably say that about maybe 95%--or probably more--of movies ""based on a true story.""

His camera unhurriedly records how the children survive, the toll that takes on their childhood, and the responsibilities that burden the 12-year-old son, played by Yuya Yagira, who won a Best Actor Award at the Cannes Film Festival.You will sense the disinterested solicitude of the mother. In contrast, the two fathers of his siblings and other adults the boy meets in seeking money and food are kind and helpful. A team coach at the school the kids long to attend invites the boy to play baseball, and he comes alive.

921218,A2CYMGGXS5QPJT,B000A5044C,Yay for Music!,"[2, 3]","I was product surfing for new films to watch and decided to pick one at random, as this won the Chicago 2004 Film Festival I thought it'd be a good one to pick. It was.The storyline is simple but captivating in its own way. The story follows 12 year old Akira and his enigmatic, alcoholic, and immature mother whose only real focus is on her new boyfriends and not her kids. After moving to their new home, Akira's mother comes home less and less and eventually leaves a note that she's not coming back forever.Akira lies to his younger siblings to keep their spirits up, but he has to deal with the truth that he is on his own to take care of his family.At first he is able to live off the little money his mother sends him, but eventually he becomes broke. He gives his siblings what freedoms he can while keeping them hidden from the landlord or risk being thrown out the the apartment. When they're seen Akira must lie again and tell the landlord that they are his ""cousins.""After weeks of the strain on money the AC is shut off, the water is shut off, and the electricity too. Akira struggles to find what money he can. He finds some help in a girl named Saki. She tries to offer Akira money but her refuses.Eventually the strain kicks completely and the strain causes tense rifts in the family that can only be tied together by simple joys of joking around and spending time in the park.This story is straightforward but speaks in a way that shows the real stages of growing up as well as understanding the world of adults even at a young age.The heartwarming younger siblings who have to smile and keep Akira going forward make the film what it is. They give a positive unbroken aura of innocence even when Akira must give up his for reality.I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed ""Grave of the Fireflies"" or likes realistic films that express important aspects of life as people grow up and move onwards.This is a job well done and is a piece that greatly deserves praise!",5,Heartbreakingly Endearing,1206057600,"03 21, 2008",2008,1992,"['was', 'product', 'surfing', 'new', 'films', 'watch', 'decided', 'pick', 'one', 'random', 'won', 'Chicago', '2004', 'Film', 'Festival', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'good', 'one', 'pick', 'was.The', 'storyline', 'simple', 'captivating', 'own', 'way', 'story', '12', 'year', 'old', 'Akira', 'enigmatic', 'alcoholic', 'immature', 'mother', 'only', 'real', 'focus', 'new', 'boyfriends', 'not', 'kids', 'moving', 'new', 'home', 'Akira', 'mother', 'home', 'less', 'less', 'eventually', 'note', 'not', 'coming', 'back', 'forever.Akira', 'younger', 'siblings', 'keep', 'spirits', 'up', 'deal', 'truth', 'own', 'take', 'care', 'family.At', 'first', 'able', 'live', 'off', 'little', 'money', 'mother', 'eventually', 'broke', 'siblings', 'what', 'freedoms', 'can', 'keeping', 'hidden', 'landlord', 'risk', 'being', 'thrown', 'out', 'apartment', 'When', ""'re"", 'seen', 'Akira', 'must', 'lie', 'again', 'tell', 'landlord', 'are', 'cousins', 'weeks', 'strain', 'money', 'AC', 'shut', 'off', 'water', 'shut', 'off', 'electricity', 'too', 'Akira', 'find', 'what', 'money', 'can', 'help', 'girl', 'named', 'Saki', 'offer', 'Akira', 'money', 'refuses.Eventually', 'strain', 'kicks', 'completely', 'strain', 'tense', 'rifts', 'family', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'tied', 'together', 'simple', 'joys', 'joking', 'around', 'spending', 'time', 'park.This', 'story', 'straightforward', 'way', 'real', 'stages', 'growing', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'understanding', 'world', 'adults', 'even', 'young', 'age.The', 'heartwarming', 'younger', 'siblings', 'who', 'have', 'smile', 'keep', 'Akira', 'going', 'forward', 'make', 'film', 'what', 'give', 'positive', 'unbroken', 'aura', 'innocence', 'even', 'when', 'Akira', 'must', 'give', 'up', 'reality.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'realistic', 'films', 'express', 'important', 'aspects', 'life', 'people', 'grow', 'up', 'move', 'onwards.This', 'job', 'well', 'done', 'piece', 'greatly', 'praise']",Nobody Knows
921219,A3IB6BLXU304PF,B000A5044C,Zenful,"[4, 7]","This is a good film, but it is not going to be for everybody.  It is a very sad tale, poignant and somber.  The acting is superb as the story slowly and meticulously unfolds.  That said, this film is not for the impatient, as is the tradition of modern Japanese film the story is protracted and heavy, virtually forcing the viewer to become invested in the characters and to feel the weight of their moral burdens.  The critical themes that emerge are unquestioning love, selflessness, selfishness, and social responsibility.  In short, a young boy is left to care for his siblings when his mother abandons them.  It is a story filled with images of daily life in modern Japan, the setting for a heart wrenching story of the hope and the promise that a child can find anywhere.If you are not a fan of modern Japanese cinema, then this film is probably not for you.  In other words, if you are looking for something to experiment with, do not purchase this.  This is for those who like Japanese film and understand a bit about Japanese culture and enjoy the exploration of these virtures...that one does not show emotion, one does not show tears, one does not reveal to the world their inner fears, thoughts or desires.  If this is your cup of tea then it will be particularly moving to see such themes so convincingly acted by mere children.  For me, that was the essence of this film and is a very real portrayal of the skills needed to survive in Japanese culture, the pride of a young boy to care for his siblings even to the end of honoring his promises.If you happen to have already seen this film and loved it, or would like an additional recommendation, check out ""Crying Out Love, In the Center of the World (2004)"" a film that won 6 awards (including 3 Japanese Academy Awards) and was nominated for 7 others.",3,"A Good Film, Not For Everybody",1132099200,"11 16, 2005",2005,1818,"['good', 'film', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'everybody', 'very', 'sad', 'tale', 'poignant', 'somber', 'acting', 'superb', 'story', 'slowly', 'meticulously', 'unfolds', 'said', 'film', 'not', 'impatient', 'tradition', 'modern', 'Japanese', 'film', 'story', 'protracted', 'heavy', 'virtually', 'forcing', 'viewer', 'become', 'invested', 'characters', 'feel', 'weight', 'moral', 'burdens', 'critical', 'themes', 'emerge', 'are', 'unquestioning', 'love', 'selflessness', 'selfishness', 'social', 'responsibility', 'short', 'young', 'boy', 'left', 'care', 'siblings', 'when', 'mother', 'abandons', 'story', 'filled', 'images', 'daily', 'life', 'modern', 'Japan', 'setting', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'story', 'hope', 'promise', 'child', 'can', 'find', 'anywhere.If', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'modern', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'then', 'film', 'probably', 'not', 'other', 'words', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'experiment', 'do', 'not', 'purchase', 'who', 'Japanese', 'film', 'understand', 'bit', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'enjoy', 'exploration', 'virtures', 'one', 'not', 'show', 'emotion', 'one', 'not', 'show', 'tears', 'one', 'not', 'reveal', 'world', 'inner', 'fears', 'thoughts', 'desires', 'cup', 'tea', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'particularly', 'moving', 'see', 'such', 'themes', 'so', 'convincingly', 'acted', 'mere', 'children', 'was', 'essence', 'film', 'very', 'real', 'portrayal', 'skills', 'needed', 'survive', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'pride', 'young', 'boy', 'care', 'siblings', 'even', 'end', 'honoring', 'promises.If', 'happen', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'film', 'loved', 'would', 'like', 'additional', 'recommendation', 'check', 'Crying', 'Out', 'Love', 'Center', 'World', '2004', 'film', 'won', '6', 'awards', 'including', '3', 'Japanese', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'was', 'nominated', '7', 'others']",Nobody Knows
