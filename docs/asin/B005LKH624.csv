1493446,AZ4Q3VAK6CIJS,B005LKH624,Mary Esterhammer-Fic,"[12, 21]","Two quirky, lonely kids in a seaside village realize they're soul mates. Then, the girl (who lives with her grandpa) is whisked away to Tokyo by her mom. After she reaches adulthood, graduates from college, and gets a good job, she returns to her now-deceased grandpa's cottage. She wants to reconnect with her childhood friend. His parents direct her to a really derelict building, where Michael is now some sort of anarchist who raises cockroaches. (He releases them en masse to cause panics in controversial buildings, part of his protests.) He seems to have no job, and no direction, and he's not particularly attractive. Nevertheless, the two rekindle their relationship. And then, right when it's about to get off the ground, he gets hit by a car.Her reaction to this is to ask his parents to allow her to exhume his body so that she can have him cloned, and she carries the clone-fetus to term and gives birth to her boyfriend. (Why? Why not instead move on and try to establish a relationship with someone more, I don't know, normal? And does the world really need another slacker? Shouldn't we be cloning Albert Schweitzers?)There are so many interesting directions this film could have taken. Apparently, clones are highly controversial in this near-future but sort of contemporary setting, and Michael 2nd Edition is ostracized. Mom/former squeeze's reaction to this is to move from her cosy little cottage to a dilapidated beach house, where they live in isolated squalor. The whole love me/love my clone issue is dropped.The cloning process is a tease. Michael 1st Edition was planning to make a statement by doing the cockroach-panic thing at a biomed center; they were on their way to do that when he was killed. But then Elizabeth ends up going there to have the ""clonebryo"" implanted. No more is said. So the whole bioethics issue is dropped, too.Michael 2e ends up finding a girlfriend, and Elizabeth has really mixed feelings about this, because Michael 2e is now almost as old as Michael 1e was when he died, so there is that whole Oedipal thing going on (as another reviewer mentioned). And it's not strictly Oedipal because she's not related to him. But the treatment of this is REALLY BORING. The whole movie is REALLY BORING, except the swarming cockroach scene did give me an anxiety rush because I'm insect-phobic, kind of. Other than that, Michael 2e and his mom/whatever just sort of sat in this beach house that BADLY needed a coat of paint. Had this film involved Michael actually painting the house, it would have been more interesting for the viewer to watch that paint dry than to have to endure these long lingering shots of angsty expressions and dialogue that leaves a lot unsaid yet moves nothing forward.This is one of those movies that sounded interesting, and so I watched because I just knew the pace would pick up. I was wrong.But it did inspire me to touch up my windowsills.",1,Womb for Improvement,1338163200,"05 28, 2012",2012,2918,"['Two', 'quirky', 'lonely', 'kids', 'seaside', 'village', 'realize', ""'re"", 'soul', 'mates', 'Then', 'girl', 'who', 'grandpa', 'whisked', 'away', 'Tokyo', 'mom', 'adulthood', 'college', 'good', 'job', 'now-deceased', 'grandpa', 'cottage', 'reconnect', 'childhood', 'friend', 'parents', 'direct', 'really', 'derelict', 'building', 'where', 'Michael', 'now', 'sort', 'anarchist', 'who', 'cockroaches', 'en', 'masse', 'cause', 'panics', 'controversial', 'buildings', 'part', 'protests', 'have', 'job', 'direction', 'not', 'particularly', 'attractive', 'Nevertheless', 'two', 'rekindle', 'relationship', 'then', 'right', 'when', 'get', 'off', 'ground', 'hit', 'car.Her', 'reaction', 'ask', 'parents', 'allow', 'exhume', 'body', 'can', 'have', 'cloned', 'clone-fetus', 'term', 'birth', 'boyfriend', 'Why', 'Why', 'not', 'instead', 'move', 'try', 'establish', 'relationship', 'someone', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'normal', 'world', 'really', 'need', 'slacker', 'Should', ""n't"", 'be', 'cloning', 'Albert', 'Schweitzers', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'interesting', 'directions', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'Apparently', 'clones', 'are', 'highly', 'controversial', 'near-future', 'sort', 'contemporary', 'setting', 'Michael', '2nd', 'Edition', 'ostracized', 'Mom/former', 'squeeze', 'reaction', 'move', 'cosy', 'little', 'cottage', 'dilapidated', 'beach', 'house', 'where', 'live', 'isolated', 'squalor', 'whole', 'love', 'me/love', 'clone', 'issue', 'dropped.The', 'cloning', 'process', 'tease', 'Michael', '1st', 'Edition', 'was', 'planning', 'make', 'statement', 'doing', 'cockroach-panic', 'thing', 'biomed', 'center', 'were', 'way', 'do', 'when', 'was', 'killed', 'then', 'Elizabeth', 'up', 'going', 'there', 'have', 'clonebryo', 'implanted', 'more', 'said', 'whole', 'bioethics', 'issue', 'dropped', '2e', 'up', 'finding', 'girlfriend', 'Elizabeth', 'really', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'Michael', '2e', 'now', 'almost', 'as', 'old', 'Michael', '1e', 'was', 'when', 'died', 'whole', 'Oedipal', 'thing', 'going', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'not', 'strictly', 'Oedipal', 'not', 'related', 'treatment', 'REALLY', 'BORING', 'whole', 'movie', 'REALLY', 'BORING', 'swarming', 'cockroach', 'scene', 'did', 'give', 'anxiety', 'rush', ""'m"", 'insect-phobic', 'kind', 'Other', 'Michael', '2e', 'mom/whatever', 'just', 'sort', 'sat', 'beach', 'house', 'BADLY', 'needed', 'coat', 'paint', 'Had', 'film', 'involved', 'Michael', 'actually', 'painting', 'house', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'viewer', 'watch', 'paint', 'dry', 'have', 'endure', 'long', 'lingering', 'shots', 'angsty', 'expressions', 'dialogue', 'lot', 'unsaid', 'yet', 'nothing', 'forward.This', 'one', 'movies', 'sounded', 'interesting', 'so', 'watched', 'just', 'knew', 'pace', 'would', 'pick', 'up', 'was', 'wrong.But', 'did', 'inspire', 'touch', 'up', 'windowsills']","Womb ( Mitra ) ( Womb - Méh ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.0 Import - Australia ]"
