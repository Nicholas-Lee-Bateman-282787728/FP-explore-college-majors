Of course, it is not a true talk show, but it does appear to be ad libed and the actual stars who are on the 'talk show' are quite tickled at what is happening around them with the Kumar family. You can't help but laugh with them, and at times, at them. I think if you have a good sense of humor and like to watch things that are not too serious, you will enjoy this.",5,Hillarious,1348358400,"09 23, 2012",2012,393,"['just', 'plain', 'funny', 'course', 'not', 'true', 'talk', 'show', 'appear', 'be', 'ad', 'libed', 'actual', 'stars', 'who', 'are', ""'talk"", 'show', 'are', 'quite', 'tickled', 'what', 'happening', 'Kumar', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'times', 'think', 'have', 'good', 'sense', 'humor', 'watch', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'serious', 'will', 'enjoy']",N/A

The Kumars at No 42 is one of the best talk show out, refreshingly  different, and based on an Asian family giving their spoilt son his own TV studio in his back garden, we are treated to a laugh a minute as celebrities line up to be interviewed by the family, including a mother who wants to feed everyone, a father who wants to know why ""everyone isn't a Doctor or a Lawyer"" and a rude, but hysterically funny Grandmother played by the sublime Meera Syal who could get a laugh out of an audience of cardboard cut outs.Very British but also very Indian, this talk show is great fun, and there is never a dull moment in the mad cap Kumar household, especially when Sanjeev, who is the talk show host tries to bring some culture and refinement to the table only to be thwarted by his well meaning but totally inappropriate family.Well worth watching if you like British comedies with a ethnic slant.",5,"Meet the Kumars, they are a hoot a minute",1175558400,"04 3, 2007",2007,955,"['will', 'laugh', 'will', 'cringe', 'when', 'watch', 'Kumars', 'No', '42', 'one', 'best', 'talk', 'show', 'refreshingly', 'different', 'based', 'Asian', 'family', 'giving', 'spoilt', 'son', 'own', 'TV', 'studio', 'back', 'garden', 'are', 'treated', 'laugh', 'minute', 'celebrities', 'line', 'be', 'interviewed', 'family', 'including', 'mother', 'who', 'feed', 'everyone', 'father', 'who', 'know', 'why', 'everyone', ""n't"", 'Doctor', 'Lawyer', 'rude', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'Grandmother', 'played', 'sublime', 'Meera', 'Syal', 'who', 'could', 'get', 'laugh', 'audience', 'cardboard', 'cut', 'outs.Very', 'British', 'also', 'very', 'Indian', 'talk', 'show', 'great', 'fun', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'mad', 'cap', 'Kumar', 'household', 'especially', 'when', 'Sanjeev', 'who', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'tries', 'bring', 'culture', 'refinement', 'table', 'only', 'be', 'thwarted', 'well', 'meaning', 'totally', 'inappropriate', 'family.Well', 'watching', 'like', 'British', 'comedies', 'ethnic', 'slant']",N/A
