1236553,AQTOG4VKMHREV,B001TJYFRU,vmw,"[6, 6]","I totally enjoyed both films. The stories of Emma and Jane Eyre are timeless and no matter who the casts are, you can't go wrong. Kate Beckingsale, and Mr. Strong are terrific. So is the rest of the cast in Emma. Great story. This version of Jane Eyre is very good. Samantha is great and she is in both films. If you are fans of period films, you'll love these two timeless classics.",5,Great films,1312329600,"08 3, 2011",2011,383,"['totally', 'enjoyed', 'films', 'stories', 'Emma', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'are', 'timeless', 'matter', 'who', 'casts', 'are', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'Kate', 'Beckingsale', 'Mr.', 'Strong', 'are', 'terrific', 'rest', 'cast', 'Emma', 'Great', 'story', 'version', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'very', 'good', 'Samantha', 'great', 'films', 'are', 'fans', 'period', 'films', ""'ll"", 'love', 'two', 'timeless', 'classics']",Emma & Jane Eyre
1236554,A29VNERZ38FLZE,B001TJYFRU,Wordkeeper,"[0, 1]","Emma was very well presented, and &#34;reasonably close&#34; to the actual book. Light, comical and entertaining. Suitable for children, especially those who study the books in school. Jane Eyre was okay - if you know the story, it is rather dark-sided. So was the movie. I would not show it to any child under 12 or 13 (that's just me). My daughters (12 and 15 yrs old) thoroughly enjoyed Emma. I only let my older daughter see Jane Eyre, as she knows the book, and even she found it to be rather dreary. Emma was done almost in the same style as BBC's Pride & Prejudice, except it was not a 6-part series - but the good quality was similar.",4,Double entertainment,1395619200,"03 24, 2014",2014,642,"['Emma', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'presented', '34', 'reasonably', 'close', '34', 'actual', 'book', 'Light', 'comical', 'entertaining', 'Suitable', 'children', 'especially', 'who', 'study', 'books', 'school', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'was', 'okay', 'know', 'story', 'rather', 'dark-sided', 'was', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'show', 'child', '12', '13', 'just', 'daughters', '12', '15', 'yrs', 'old', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Emma', 'only', 'let', 'older', 'daughter', 'see', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'book', 'even', 'found', 'be', 'rather', 'dreary', 'Emma', 'was', 'done', 'almost', 'same', 'style', 'BBC', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'was', 'not', '6-part', 'series', 'good', 'quality', 'was', 'similar']",Emma & Jane Eyre

One is by Jane Austen, Queen of the Romance Novels - the other by one of the Bronte sisters - both of whom each wrote an incredible opus.  These two movies are a delight to watch.  They take us back to a simpler time - except it was not simple to navigate the very difficult nuances of moral behavior.  The slightest hint of scandal, associations with people below your station - all pitfalls that seem unbelievable to our modern society.  However, they were all too real to the people who lived, loved and balanced their hearts against the mores of their day.  These romance novels have been copied, but never equaled.  Don't miss either of them!",5,Romance and Real Love,1239840000,"04 16, 2009",2009,760,"['like', 'period', 'pieces', 'set', 'Victorian', 'England', 'then', 'will', 'love', 'excellent', 'renditions', 'One', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Queen', 'Romance', 'Novels', 'other', 'one', 'Bronte', 'sisters', 'whom', 'wrote', 'incredible', 'opus', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'delight', 'watch', 'take', 'back', 'simpler', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'simple', 'navigate', 'very', 'difficult', 'nuances', 'moral', 'behavior', 'slightest', 'hint', 'scandal', 'associations', 'people', 'station', 'pitfalls', 'seem', 'unbelievable', 'modern', 'society', 'However', 'were', 'too', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'loved', 'balanced', 'hearts', 'mores', 'day', 'romance', 'novels', 'have', 'been', 'copied', 'never', 'equaled', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss']",Emma & Jane Eyre
