I saw it with my Dad and my best friend on a summer afternoon in 1977 when I was 12. In looking at it now, one would have to be about  12 or 13 to fully appreciate the story of the adventures of kids who steal a van to play in a baseball game across the country. Good scenery and it certainly captures the spirit of it's era. As for adult audiences? I don't think so, unless you were a kid during the 70s. You hadda be there.

It&#8217;s like the completely forgotten Police Academy series for why it had to result in sequels. The players are the worst, and the boy who played the effeminate Carmen character takes the cake for stinking up every scene he appears in. Although he brings a lot of energy to the film, William Devane is just tad too much, especially during the baseball practices. California Champions? The Bad News Bears don&#8217;t look any better than they did on the very first day of practice in the original. And to get in a championship form within several days to play in a rinky-dinky four inning charity game, the makers are trying too hard to pull the wool over my eyes. Well, it didn&#8217;t work.

What I like about the movie is that The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training is the comic and poignant second-in-the-series of adventures with the pint-sized sandlot ballplayers initiated with the smash success, The Bad News Bears. The picture picks up the Bears' career a year after their infamous second-place finish in the North Valley League. Faced with a chance to play the Houston Toros for a shot at the Japanese champs, they devise a way to get to Texas to play at the famed Astrodome. On their pilgrimage to Houston, the Bears gain a new coach; dump that coach; add a new pitcher who can't get his fastball over the plate; find another coach who shows him how it's done, and go on to a come-back victory with all eyes on Japan. What I dislike about the movie is that I wanted to see more of it.

Matthau's sly, broken-down performance as Buttermaker that elevated the original.  This time out,  William Devane coaches the team, and though he does a fine job, the movie doesn't spark the way the first on did.Also missing is Tatum O'Neal.  This time out, it's Jackie Earle Haley taking centerstage as the team sponsored by Chico's Bail Bonds heads to the Astrodome to battle the pride of Texas, the Toros.  Devane is his Haley's estranged father and their relationship forms the emotional core of the film.This is a pleasant enough romp.

223761,A2STDDBMI6CIPA,6300216985,"W. gallegos ""wg6175""","[3, 4]","Not that long ago before today's little league baseball players dreamed of one day joining the majors because of the 10 to 20 million dollars they could make in a year (yes,a year!),there was this movie,The Bad News Bears in breaking training. What I enjoyed about this movie was that it was one of those classic baseball movies that could never be remade today. After watching this movie back in the day,we all dreamed of having our little league team play in what was at the time a baseball stadium like no other....The Houston Astrodome. In this 2nd chapter of the Bad News Bears trilogy,the San Fernando Valley-based team is given the opportunity to play in an exhibition game vs the home town Toros in the Astrodome. Having abandoned their coach,the coachless team heads to the lonestar state in hopes of living every young ball player's dream while team leader Kelly pursues the opportunity to reunite with his father,played by William Devane. Watching this movie makes you realizes how much the game has changed for the worse considering this movie was made as recent as the late 1970's. Today,young ball players are doing steroids,major league stars are putting money over fans as their top priority,and teams are threatening to move to other cities if their demands for a new ballpark are not met. Had I told someone in 1977 that this was the future of little league and major league baseball,would they believe me? If you want your young ones to see a great baseball movie full of young but true role models,then get this dvd. Oh,by the way,if you are wondering why I believe this movie could not be remade today,think about this......with all the new stadiums we have seen built in the last 15 years,it would be hard to argue why one stadium should be picked over all the others as the location of filming.
