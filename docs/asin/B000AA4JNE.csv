924908,A19Z4IDNL1MGG4,B000AA4JNE,"Austenparker ""Life is too short to read bad b...","[111, 114]","The premise of the original short, Creature Comforts, was to take interviews with ordinary people & transform them into comedic animal representations via the medium of claymation. Nick Park & his team developed this brilliantly funny concept through an entire 13 episode series.This dvd is amazingly funny - even what may be perceived as the weaker episodes have their sparkling moments. If you're a fan of Wallace & Gromit or just a fan of funny animation, this dvd is for you. The format has no definite story line, but rather is a topical discussion - kind of like Dr. Doolittle meets Oprah. Addressing such questions as ""Where do we come from?"", ""Are there aliens?"" and ""Cats vs. Dogs"" - these installments will leave you in stitches. The animation is flawless, the interview editing superb. Just an overall delight.",5,Brilliant!,1128038400,"09 30, 2005",2005,821,"['premise', 'original', 'short', 'Creature', 'Comforts', 'was', 'take', 'interviews', 'ordinary', 'people', 'transform', 'comedic', 'animal', 'representations', 'medium', 'claymation', 'Nick', 'Park', 'team', 'developed', 'brilliantly', 'funny', 'concept', 'entire', '13', 'episode', 'series.This', 'dvd', 'amazingly', 'funny', 'even', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'perceived', 'weaker', 'episodes', 'have', 'sparkling', 'moments', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Wallace', 'Gromit', 'just', 'fan', 'funny', 'animation', 'dvd', 'format', 'definite', 'story', 'line', 'rather', 'topical', 'discussion', 'kind', 'Dr.', 'Doolittle', 'Oprah', 'Addressing', 'such', 'questions', 'Where', 'do', 'come', 'Are', 'there', 'aliens', 'Cats', 'vs', 'Dogs', 'installments', 'will', 'leave', 'stitches', 'animation', 'flawless', 'interview', 'editing', 'superb', 'Just', 'overall', 'delight']",Creature Comforts - The Complete First Season

I had hoped that this series would have the same quirkiness and clever charm as W&G. Sadly, this is not the case. Although the series is kind of funny, it never really evokes more than a chuckle.

The real humoue comes not just in what they say or the way they say it, but in how voice is matched to character.  Imagine a stern sounding lab mouse talking about working in a lab or denouncing growing an ""ear"" on the back of a mouse as said mouse walks behind him and looks at him quizically.The humour is subtle as you recognise human traits in the creatures, especially if you watch the making of feature and see the director  acting it out as reference for the animators.And yes, some American viewers may struggle with British regional dialects but give it time and maybe watch it again and really listen.My favourite characters are Pickles the guide dog,  Captain Cuddlepuss and Trixie, a married cat and dog relaxing on a sofa, and Sid and Nancy the rats.

They ""interviewed"" all of these creatures and really brought them to life.  It's absolutely amazing.From a garden slug to a polar bear family, from a hamster to a circus elephant, from a worm to a cow, they're all here and more.  What these creators have done is brilliant.  Recording voices from all over England and matching them to various animals, they really humanized the creatures so much you actually look forward to hearing what they have to say.

That was some time ago.  I also enjoyed the Wallace & Gromit episodes.I saw the '05 Christmas special and loved it, and I was thrilled to get Season One on DVD.The thing I love about the characters is the great detail and patience which obviously goes into every one of the vignettes (the bonus documentary on the DVD shows you just how it's done).  I especially love how they show human emotions in the animals, things you normaly wouldn't pick up on talking to a person, you see much more clearly with the creatures (eyebrow raises, movements of the face and body, etc.).And the fun thing is they didn't have to write any of it!  The Great British Public is a howl when it comes to the asking of mundane questions (What's It All About, The Beach).
