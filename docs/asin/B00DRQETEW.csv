Now it's not a horrible movie but just not that great either. This so called anthology movie has really only one really good short and that's the last one. The first was ok and the second was pretty bad and didn't really fit. The whole movie was a nice little surprise with all the other horror movie crap floating out there and i would recommend a watch but I blind bought it off of the trailer and I'm not upset with my purchase just let down. Overall was ok and by no means is it a new Halloween staple. Not even close. I call this horror movie junk food.

This what I said:Are you a horror freak? Do you watch horror movies almost compulsively? If yes, I am talking to you. As you also do, I'm sure, I continuously scour for movies that I haven't yet seen and very few of them are actually very satisfying. All Hallow's Eve is one of those rare surprises. I loved the look of the clown, which is an accomplishment as I usually don't find movie clowns actually disturbing. This one was. His menace was apparent.

1660708,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B00DRQETEW,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[5, 10]","RLJ and Image Entertainment are quickly gaining a reputation for releasing some interesting independent films in both the horror and sci-fi genres. I'm not saying that you can just pick up anything they put out. Still, the quality of their projects keep getting stronger and stronger both in story content and recognizable talent appearing in their films.Just as I say this, their latest horror offering &#34;All Hallows' Eve&#34; doesn't have any recognizable stars in it. However, this works in the movie's favor. It roots you in the film and keeps you from tethering yourself in reality through the sight of familiar faces like Christian Bale or Sarah Michelle Gellar.Sarah (Katie Maguire) spends Halloween babysitting her friend's son(Cole Mathewson) and daughter (Sydney Freihofer). After an evening of trick 'r treating, the three settle down in front of a scary movie to empty out the children's' goodie bags. Timmy finds an old VHS tape in his stash and quickly talks Sarah into letting them watch it. They soon find themselves immersed in an anthology of disturbing short films that fit the chilling holiday they're celebrating. Thank goodness they're only make-believe&#8230; or are they?&#34;All Hallows' Eve&#34; is definitely a treat for the Halloween season. It's an interesting blend of intertwining tales in the spirit of &#34;Creepshow&#34; and &#34;Tales from the Crypt&#34; with an evil clown that would rival Pennywise from Stephen King's &#34;It.&#34; Art, the evil clown, is the constant throughout these macabre stories.Director/Writer Damien Leone knew what he was doing when having musicians Noir Deco handle the score for &#34;All Hallows' Eve.&#34; They drum up memories of the electronic soundtracks for John Carpenter's &#34;Halloween&#34; and &#34;Halloween III: Season of the Witch.&#34; I can only imagine this was intentional. It definitely adds to the creepiness and atmosphere of the film.&#34;All Hallows' Eve&#34; is light on bonus material. The only special feature included on the DVD is audio commentary provided by Writer/Director Damien Leone and actor Mike Giannelli. Giannelli plays Art the Clown in the movie and quite possibly might not ever get another job because of it.Although it's not rated, I would give &#34;All Hallows' Eve&#34; an &#34;R.&#34; It has a lot of graphic violence and gore. There's also adult language and situations. I was a bit disappointed in the full frontal nudity in the last segment. Before that, there was no nudity at all. I think Leone could've gotten his point across without it. I know it doesn't seem like that big of a deal to some people in a movie that has so much blood and violence. However, to some viewers it's a deal-breaker that causes them from recommending the film to others.&#34;All Hallows' Eve&#34; is perfect for an adult night of horror festivities. The stories range from old-fashioned &#34;Rosemary's Baby&#34;-type thrills to sci-fi schlock and slasher scares. Each segment is seen as a film within a film, so there's added dirt and scratches to the picture to give it grindhouse and classic flavors. Let me also add that if you weren't already scared of clowns before now, you will be after watching this.",4,"""All Hallows' Eve"" Provides Both Tricks and Treats",1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,3207,"['RLJ', 'Image', 'Entertainment', 'are', 'quickly', 'gaining', 'reputation', 'releasing', 'interesting', 'independent', 'films', 'horror', 'sci-fi', 'genres', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'can', 'just', 'pick', 'up', 'anything', 'put', 'out', 'Still', 'quality', 'projects', 'keep', 'getting', 'stronger', 'stronger', 'story', 'content', 'recognizable', 'talent', 'appearing', 'films.Just', 'say', 'latest', 'horror', 'offering', '34', 'Hallows', 'Eve', '34', ""n't"", 'have', 'recognizable', 'stars', 'However', 'movie', 'favor', 'film', 'keeps', 'tethering', 'reality', 'sight', 'familiar', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar.Sarah', 'Katie', 'Maguire', 'Halloween', 'babysitting', 'friend', 'son', 'Cole', 'Mathewson', 'daughter', 'Sydney', 'Freihofer', 'evening', 'trick', 'r', 'treating', 'three', 'settle', 'down', 'front', 'scary', 'movie', 'empty', 'out', 'children', 'goodie', 'bags', 'Timmy', 'old', 'VHS', 'tape', 'stash', 'quickly', 'talks', 'Sarah', 'letting', 'watch', 'soon', 'find', 'immersed', 'anthology', 'disturbing', 'short', 'films', 'fit', 'chilling', 'holiday', ""'re"", 'celebrating', 'Thank', 'goodness', ""'re"", 'only', 'make-believe', '8230', 'are', '34', 'Hallows', 'Eve', '34', 'definitely', 'treat', 'Halloween', 'season', 'interesting', 'blend', 'intertwining', 'tales', 'spirit', '34', 'Creepshow', '34', '34', 'Tales', 'Crypt', '34', 'evil', 'clown', 'would', 'rival', 'Pennywise', 'Stephen', 'King', '34', 'It.', '34', 'Art', 'evil', 'clown', 'constant', 'macabre', 'stories.Director/Writer', 'Damien', 'Leone', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'when', 'having', 'musicians', 'Noir', 'Deco', 'handle', 'score', '34', 'Hallows', 'Eve.', '34', 'drum', 'up', 'memories', 'electronic', 'soundtracks', 'John', 'Carpenter', '34', 'Halloween', '34', '34', 'Halloween', 'III', 'Season', 'Witch.', '34', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'was', 'intentional', 'definitely', 'creepiness', 'atmosphere', 'film.', '34', 'Hallows', 'Eve', '34', 'light', 'bonus', 'material', 'only', 'special', 'feature', 'included', 'DVD', 'audio', 'commentary', 'provided', 'Writer/Director', 'Damien', 'Leone', 'actor', 'Mike', 'Giannelli', 'Giannelli', 'Art', 'Clown', 'movie', 'quite', 'possibly', 'might', 'not', 'ever', 'get', 'job', 'not', 'rated', 'would', 'give', '34', 'Hallows', 'Eve', '34', '34', 'R.', '34', 'lot', 'graphic', 'violence', 'gore', 'also', 'adult', 'language', 'situations', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'last', 'segment', 'was', 'nudity', 'think', 'Leone', 'could', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'point', 'know', ""n't"", 'seem', 'big', 'deal', 'people', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'blood', 'violence', 'However', 'viewers', 'deal-breaker', 'recommending', 'film', 'others.', '34', 'Hallows', 'Eve', '34', 'perfect', 'adult', 'night', 'horror', 'festivities', 'stories', 'range', 'old-fashioned', '34', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', '34', '-type', 'thrills', 'sci-fi', 'schlock', 'slasher', 'scares', 'segment', 'seen', 'film', 'film', 'added', 'dirt', 'scratches', 'picture', 'give', 'grindhouse', 'classic', 'flavors', 'Let', 'also', 'add', 'were', ""n't"", 'already', 'scared', 'clowns', 'now', 'will', 'be', 'watching']",All Hallows' Eve

1660712,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00DRQETEW,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[2, 2]","Whoever made the trailer for this thing deserves an award. I mean, I'm an experienced enough movie goer at this point not to be suckered so easily by a well-edited commercial for a film, but I admit: this movie's trailer got my hopes way up.Apparently it was created based on the success of a few internet clips of the clown that features prominently in the film. That's fair enough. It's a creepily done clown in most ways. The film itself: not so much.First of all, it's an anthology film. No points lost for that. These appear to be gaining popularity. Although it means the films often lack cohesion, it also gives it multiple chances to win audiences over.The over-arching story here is about a baby-sitter with the personality of a toothbrush taking care of two abrasively over-acted kids on Halloween night, all of them so meticulously make-upped and lit that it's impossible not to imagine the rest of the crew standing mere feet away (made even easier by the fact that there's virtually no establishing shots, with everyone in close-up). One of the kids, an alarmingly skinny boy, receives a blank videotape in his bag of Halloween candy, and they all sit down to watch it. Lucky for us, this family still owns a VCR, because the video contains our three scary stories.STORY #1 - CREEPY TRAIN STATION IS CREEPYA young woman has a close encounter with the film's scary clown villain while waiting for a train at a station that more closely resembles an elementary school boiler room. There are a few creepy scenes and moments in this one, and the actors really give it their all. The story, however, degenerates into random nonsense  and monster make-up that is a fang or two shy of really selling itself. It also includes a bad guy who keeps awkwardly licking his lips, like chapped skin is scary.STORY #2 - WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD!A young woman is unpacking boxes in her new home. Great pains are taken to illustrate how isolated the location is. Nothing happens for about ten minutes, although the electricity does go out and the women gets scared by bright lights from outside. Then she discovers the alien. Or rather, the skinny guy in the easily damaged alien costume. Cue screaming and running and absolutely nothing else.STORY #3 - THE GASH STATIONIn the goriest of the three clips, a young woman (must it always be young women?) encounters our clown friend at a gas station, where he begins terrorizing her because he's evil or something. This section of the film is shot in a gritty, sepia-ish tone that makes it feel more engaging, and the effects are the strongest of the movie. There's more of an attempt at a story -- although not much -- but the ending is so desperate to be shocking that it comes across as almost laughable.I'm going to let you guess how the movie ends, although I recommend not being too imaginative with your guesses. All in all, it's not the worst horror film I've ever seen, but it does seem to think that a creepy bad guy and some intermittent gore are good substitutes for plot and character, leaving the whole thing pretty hollow.",2,Mostly Hollow Eve,1391990400,"02 10, 2014",2014,3082,"['made', 'trailer', 'thing', 'award', 'mean', ""'m"", 'experienced', 'enough', 'movie', 'goer', 'point', 'not', 'be', 'suckered', 'so', 'easily', 'well-edited', 'commercial', 'film', 'admit', 'movie', 'trailer', 'got', 'hopes', 'way', 'was', 'created', 'based', 'success', 'few', 'internet', 'clips', 'clown', 'prominently', 'film', 'fair', 'enough', 'creepily', 'done', 'clown', 'most', 'ways', 'film', 'not', 'much.First', 'anthology', 'film', 'points', 'lost', 'appear', 'be', 'gaining', 'popularity', 'films', 'often', 'lack', 'cohesion', 'also', 'multiple', 'chances', 'win', 'audiences', 'over.The', 'over-arching', 'story', 'here', 'baby-sitter', 'personality', 'toothbrush', 'taking', 'care', 'two', 'abrasively', 'over-acted', 'kids', 'Halloween', 'night', 'so', 'meticulously', 'make-upped', 'impossible', 'not', 'imagine', 'rest', 'crew', 'standing', 'mere', 'feet', 'away', 'made', 'even', 'easier', 'fact', 'virtually', 'establishing', 'shots', 'everyone', 'close-up', 'One', 'kids', 'alarmingly', 'skinny', 'boy', 'blank', 'videotape', 'bag', 'Halloween', 'candy', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'Lucky', 'family', 'still', 'VCR', 'video', 'three', 'scary', 'stories.STORY', '1', 'CREEPY', 'TRAIN', 'STATION', 'IS', 'CREEPYA', 'young', 'woman', 'close', 'encounter', 'film', 'scary', 'clown', 'villain', 'waiting', 'train', 'station', 'more', 'closely', 'elementary', 'school', 'boiler', 'room', 'are', 'few', 'creepy', 'scenes', 'moments', 'one', 'actors', 'really', 'give', 'story', 'however', 'random', 'nonsense', 'monster', 'make-up', 'fang', 'two', 'shy', 'really', 'selling', 'also', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'awkwardly', 'licking', 'lips', 'chapped', 'skin', 'scary.STORY', '2', 'WELCOME', 'TO', 'THE', 'NEIGHBORHOOD', 'A', 'young', 'woman', 'unpacking', 'boxes', 'new', 'home', 'Great', 'pains', 'are', 'taken', 'illustrate', 'how', 'isolated', 'location', 'Nothing', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'electricity', 'go', 'out', 'women', 'scared', 'bright', 'lights', 'outside', 'Then', 'alien', 'rather', 'skinny', 'guy', 'easily', 'damaged', 'alien', 'costume', 'Cue', 'screaming', 'running', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'else.STORY', '3', 'GASH', 'STATIONIn', 'goriest', 'three', 'clips', 'young', 'woman', 'must', 'always', 'be', 'young', 'women', 'clown', 'friend', 'gas', 'station', 'where', 'terrorizing', 'evil', 'something', 'section', 'film', 'shot', 'gritty', 'sepia-ish', 'tone', 'feel', 'more', 'engaging', 'effects', 'are', 'strongest', 'movie', 'more', 'attempt', 'story', 'not', 'much', 'ending', 'so', 'desperate', 'be', 'shocking', 'across', 'almost', 'laughable.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'let', 'guess', 'how', 'movie', 'recommend', 'not', 'being', 'too', 'imaginative', 'guesses', 'not', 'worst', 'horror', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'seem', 'think', 'creepy', 'bad', 'guy', 'intermittent', 'gore', 'are', 'good', 'substitutes', 'plot', 'character', 'leaving', 'whole', 'thing', 'pretty', 'hollow']",All Hallows' Eve

It has some flaws as mentioned in some of the other reviews. Some of the dialogue seems unnatural and forced at times. Not all of the three short stories deliver a big punch.In spite of its flaws, this film has a lot going for it to make worth watching.  It has one of the creepiest clowns I have ever seen.  Clowns scare me anyway, but this one goes way over the top on the creepy meter.  The grainy filming washed out colors and glaring light reminded me of the old slash and gore horror flicks I watched at the theater as a kid&#8230;.real grind house stuff.Yes, some of the plot is overused, the babysitter on Halloween night, but I saw that as more of a homage to the early slasher films as opposed to a lack of imagination. It is pretty obvious that some of the scenes of the babysitter and children are very much inspired and are a takeoff of Halloween.I wouldn&#8217;t recommend spending a lot o money to own this movie, but I would definitely recommend renting it or purchasing if the price is under 10$",4,A pretty decent and sufficintly creepy little film,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,1110,"['Firstly', 'need', 'understand', 'not', 'big', 'budget', 'film', 'great', 'acting', 'writing', 'flaws', 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviews', 'dialogue', 'unnatural', 'forced', 'times', 'Not', 'three', 'short', 'stories', 'deliver', 'big', 'punch.In', 'spite', 'flaws', 'film', 'lot', 'going', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'one', 'creepiest', 'clowns', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Clowns', 'scare', 'anyway', 'one', 'way', 'top', 'creepy', 'meter', 'grainy', 'filming', 'washed', 'out', 'colors', 'glaring', 'light', 'reminded', 'old', 'slash', 'gore', 'horror', 'watched', 'theater', 'kid', '8230', 'grind', 'house', 'stuff.Yes', 'plot', 'overused', 'babysitter', 'Halloween', 'night', 'saw', 'more', 'homage', 'early', 'slasher', 'films', 'opposed', 'lack', 'imagination', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'scenes', 'babysitter', 'children', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'inspired', 'are', 'takeoff', 'Halloween.I', 'wouldn', '8217', 'recommend', 'spending', 'lot', 'o', 'money', 'own', 'movie', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'renting', 'purchasing', 'price', '10']",All Hallows' Eve

Seriously, this thing was exactly like a college drama class project that not only didn't get an A but actually failed to pass.  Teacher gives it a D at best.

Nothing to do with the movie.  Some young adults sit around telling a few Halloween spooky stories.  That's it.  The stories they tell are acted out.  Poorly so.

1660718,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B00DRQETEW,Tim Janson,"[4, 5]","There&#8217;s nothing like a good Halloween film and unfortunately All Hallow&#8217;s Eve is nothing like a good Halloween film.  The movie liberally borrows parts of its plot from Halloween and Trick &#8216;R Treat, two vastly superior films.  A Babysitter (who looks much older than the character she is playing) is babysitting for two kids on Halloween night.  Now why is it that ONLY in the movies do kids carve their Jack-o-lanterns on Halloween night AFTER they have returned from trick-or-treating?  What&#8217;s the point?  I&#8217;ve carved a field full of pumpkins in my life and always before Halloween night.  Anyhow, Timmy dumps out his candy sack to find that someone stuck a VHS tape in his bag.  The tape is unmarked and both Timmy and sister Tia want to watch the tape but babysitter Sarah refuses&#8230;until the kids pester the hell out of her.The tape features 3 different stories each hosted by a silent but horrifying clown.  The first involves women who are abducted aboard a train and taken captive in the tunnels by a group of cultist cannibals.  The second story involves a woman who is terrorized in her new home by an alien.  The third film involves a woman with car trouble who arrives at a gas station to find our clown cutting up the attendant.The three films are mind-boggling horrendous.  They are filmed with a grainy sketchy quality to try and give it a grindhouse appeal but it simply comes off looking cheap and amateurish.  There&#8217;s no rhyme or reason to any of the stories.  The alien in the second story looks like it was created using a dollar store mask.  The only mildly intriguing part is the wraparound story of the babysitter who discovers that watching the tape has brought the clown into the real world&#8230;like that wasn&#8217;t predictable.All Hallow&#8217;s Eve is gory but its cheesy, low-budget laughable gore.

1660719,A2HC5RRZ399BSD,B00DRQETEW,Tyler,"[9, 12]","I was pretty excited to see this one. The trailer looked amazing. Unfortunately, I finished it feeling underwhelmed and slightly disappointed. I had never seen any of the shorts on youtube before, so this was all new to me. Out of the 3 short films in this, I really only enjoyed the last one. The others are overly simplistic and predictable. The frame story that showcases the other three is decent, but not at all original. One of the stories in the collection does not even take place on Halloween, and features someone so obviously in an Alien suit it comes off comical. I'll watch it again, but I don't think this movie is going to catch on as a Halloween staple. Not at all. I wouldn't write off the director, hopefully he can churn out a few more films as fun and creepy as ""Terrifier"". I wanted to like this as much as anyone, but the fact is...it's just not that good. I think it's worth a rental (some people really seem to like it, though i find some of the enthusiasm suspicious...i've seen the movie.)
