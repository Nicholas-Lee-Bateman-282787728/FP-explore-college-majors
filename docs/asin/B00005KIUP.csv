I already had &quot;Keppel Road&quot; and, although it was far from perfect, I didn't think this one would be much different. Well, I was wrong. This is the real thing. It has PLENTY of archival footage, from television appearances (including their first one ever in Australia) to home movies and videos. Lengthy, informative and perfectly edited, &quot;This is Where I Came In&quot; is one of the best documentaries I have seen on a musical group.

It's a two hour presentation that will leave you feeling that the incredible success Barry, Robin and Maurice have had is very well deserved. The brothers Gibb were blessed with an incredible ability to write and produce massively popular hits - they are the second most successful group in the history of popular music after the Beatles (in terms of record sales). Of course, in terms of longevity, they are rivalled only by the Rolling Stones.Told in their own words (also with narration), the story covers their entire lives: their relationships with each other, their wives, their families, their triumphs and trageries and, of course, their unbelievable success. The documentary is littered with numerous achievements.If you are greatly interested in the Bee Gees (or even if you have a passing interest) you really owe it to yourself to get this DVD or video. Although it was produced in 2001 prior to Maurice's untimely death, it's still absolutely fascinating viewing.

What a fascinating story they have.  I was absolutely bowled over by their charm and candor.  And then there's the music. I have collected several cds since I saw this last year. This version seems edited a bit differently, seemingly with more material. It's very grand and glorious to watch  their lives unfold and hear their music develop over the  years.

It was the first DVD I bought, and it's the only programme for which I have both the DVD and the video.  The video (which is 100 minutes) was originally broadcast on A&amp;E and is fantastic and certainly worth getting if you don't have a DVD player.  But the DVD, which is a slightly different mix, is a full 2 hours, with the additional footage (which was cut from the video and television broadcast) sprinkled throughout.  Included primarily are additional minutes of archival video footage, but additional bits from interviews and bits of background information have also been tucked in here and there.The DVD also offers a couple of worthwhile special features.  Firstly, there's the video for the single ""This Is Where I Came In""; and secondly, there is an additional 30 minutes or so of interviews with Barry, Robin and Maurice that did not make it into the presentation.  These are just snippets (a minute or two on a mishmash of topics), but they are certainly worth checking out.As for the presentation itself, a full one-half of the video/DVD is dedicated to chronicling the Gibbs' early years, and there is plenty of archival footage from home videos and early television performances.  In addition to chronicling the rollercoaster path their career has taken, the presentation includes loads about their personal lives--from their marriages, divorces, and children's births to the tragic deaths of their brother Andy and of their dad.  The video/DVD features interviews with each of the three brothers, with their mum Barbara, with Robin's wife Dweena, with Maurice's wife Yvonne, with Robert Stigwood and various other individuals in the music industry.  What really makes this presentation sparkle are the many, many excerpts from their enormous body of music that play in the background.In conclusion, this is an outstanding visual biography of an extraordinarily talented trio of brothers--one that is both rich in content and beautifully presented.  The poignancy one feels near the end of the video/DVD is only heightened by our knowledge of the tragic death of Maurice Gibb less than two years after it was made, and it is sadly ironic that this biography has served to mark the end of an era.  With it we have been given a rare and special look into the lives of three brothers with a rare and special talent who wrote, recorded and performed some of the most beautiful music the world has ever heard.  This is the definitive biography of the Bee Gees--a keepsake that will be cherished and enjoyed by both serious and casual fans alike, or indeed by anyone whose lives have been made just a little richer by the music of the Brothers Gibb.Extremely highly recommended.",5,The Definitive Biography,1057708800,"07 9, 2003",2003,2808,"['Bee', 'Gees', 'were', 'one', 'most', 'significant', 'bands', '20th', 'century', '2001', 'biography', 'absolute', 'gem', 'was', 'first', 'DVD', 'bought', 'only', 'programme', 'have', 'DVD', 'video', 'video', '100', 'minutes', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'A', 'amp', 'E', 'fantastic', 'certainly', 'worth', 'getting', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'DVD', 'player', 'DVD', 'slightly', 'different', 'mix', 'full', '2', 'hours', 'additional', 'footage', 'was', 'cut', 'video', 'television', 'broadcast', 'sprinkled', 'Included', 'primarily', 'are', 'additional', 'minutes', 'archival', 'video', 'footage', 'additional', 'bits', 'interviews', 'bits', 'background', 'information', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'tucked', 'here', 'there.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'couple', 'worthwhile', 'special', 'features', 'Firstly', 'video', 'single', 'Where', 'Came', 'secondly', 'additional', '30', 'minutes', 'so', 'interviews', 'Barry', 'Robin', 'Maurice', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'presentation', 'are', 'just', 'snippets', 'minute', 'two', 'mishmash', 'topics', 'are', 'certainly', 'worth', 'checking', 'out.As', 'presentation', 'full', 'one-half', 'video/DVD', 'dedicated', 'chronicling', 'Gibbs', 'early', 'years', 'plenty', 'archival', 'footage', 'home', 'videos', 'early', 'television', 'performances', 'addition', 'chronicling', 'rollercoaster', 'path', 'career', 'taken', 'presentation', 'loads', 'personal', 'lives', 'marriages', 'divorces', 'children', 'births', 'tragic', 'deaths', 'brother', 'Andy', 'dad', 'video/DVD', 'interviews', 'three', 'brothers', 'mum', 'Barbara', 'Robin', 'wife', 'Dweena', 'Maurice', 'wife', 'Yvonne', 'Robert', 'Stigwood', 'various', 'other', 'individuals', 'music', 'industry', 'What', 'really', 'presentation', 'sparkle', 'are', 'many', 'many', 'excerpts', 'enormous', 'body', 'music', 'play', 'background.In', 'conclusion', 'outstanding', 'visual', 'biography', 'extraordinarily', 'talented', 'trio', 'brothers', 'one', 'rich', 'content', 'beautifully', 'presented', 'poignancy', 'one', 'feels', 'end', 'video/DVD', 'only', 'heightened', 'knowledge', 'tragic', 'death', 'Maurice', 'Gibb', 'less', 'two', 'years', 'was', 'made', 'sadly', 'ironic', 'biography', 'served', 'mark', 'end', 'era', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'rare', 'special', 'look', 'lives', 'three', 'brothers', 'rare', 'special', 'talent', 'who', 'wrote', 'recorded', 'performed', 'most', 'beautiful', 'music', 'world', 'ever', 'heard', 'definitive', 'biography', 'Bee', 'Gees', 'keepsake', 'will', 'be', 'cherished', 'enjoyed', 'serious', 'casual', 'fans', 'alike', 'indeed', 'anyone', 'lives', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'just', 'little', 'richer', 'music', 'Brothers', 'Gibb.Extremely', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A
