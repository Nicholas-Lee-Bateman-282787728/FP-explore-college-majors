The music if FANTASTIC and the dancing is incredible.  My two favorite things in a Bollywood movie.  However, the storyline is far above the music and dancing.  I didn't really know much about this movie, I really just bought it because I love Aishwarya Rai movies.  I don't want to give away any of the movie, each line, each scene should be enjoyed first hand.  This is a movie that everyone likes when I show it to them.  And it doesn't hurt that Arjun Rampal (I think that's his name) who plays Jai, is very nice to look at as well as a great actor.  I HIGHLY recommend this one.",5,10 stars,1195603200,"11 21, 2007",2007,692,"['was', 'recent', 'purchase', 'could', 'give', 'one', '10', 'star', 'rating', 'would', 'because', 'love', 'movie', 'music', 'FANTASTIC', 'dancing', 'incredible', 'two', 'favorite', 'things', 'Bollywood', 'movie', 'However', 'storyline', 'far', 'music', 'dancing', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'much', 'movie', 'really', 'just', 'bought', 'love', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'movie', 'line', 'scene', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'hand', 'movie', 'everyone', 'when', 'show', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'Arjun', 'Rampal', 'think', 'name', 'who', 'Jai', 'very', 'nice', 'look', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'actor', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'one']",N/A
765475,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0000APAEC,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[5, 5]","I have some conflicting opinions about this emotionally complex film, which I'll try to dance around without giving any of the story away (and it won't be easy).  When it comes down to it, though, I just can't give Dil Ka Rishta less than five stars.  The story is deep and compelling, the acting is top-notch (Paresh Rawal is a particular delight), the music is incredible, the cinematography is exquisite, and Aishwarya Rai is even more gorgeous than usual.  With Isha Koppikar included in the cast, this film is lacking nothing in the radiant beauty department.My only problem with the film is Jai (Arjun Rampal), the main character.  I didn't like him, and I certainly didn't respect him.  I can't blame him for falling in love with the most beautiful woman in the world, but the guy knows even less about women than I do.  I at least know that you can't buy a woman's love with expensive gifts, and I also know that there comes a time when you just have to get over it, already.  Go ahead and wallow in self-pity for quite a while, but get on with life - and think about the happiness of the woman who rejected you instead of just yourself.  Jai, needless to say, thinks only of himself.  Then something truly life-changing happens, giving Jai a second chance with Tia (Rai).  Since I can't give anything away about the plot, I really can't explain this in my review - but, in my opinion, Jai doesn't deserve another shot - not even close.  I felt a little sorry for him, as his emotional issues and devastating guilt threaten to tear him apart, but not all that much - he's not too far away from contemptible in my book.  Obviously, as my feelings about Jai make clear, Dil Ka Rishta is in no way your typical romance.  Love doesn't get any more complicated than it does here - and that does make for a powerful storyline.I love every single piece of music in the film.  There are a couple of wonderful love songs (including the title track) played out in front of some breathtaking scenes of natural beauty.  Dil Chura Le is a tender, exquisite love song.  Saajan Saajan is also all about love, but it's an energetic, well-choreographed song and dance featuring Aishwarya.  Then there's Dayya Dayya Dayya; some folks don't consider the song all that special, but I really like it - and Aishwarya is absolutely smoking as she goes through multiple costumes over the course of the performance.Dil Ka Rishta does feature some light comedy here and there, but in its essence it is an extraordinarily tragic story about one woman and two lives.  Despite her critics, Aishwarya Rai is an accomplished dramatic actress - she proves it in numerous scenes here.  I wish I could better describe the complexity of the film, but it's impossible to do so without revealing far too much of the storyline.  In essence, this is a film to experience, not merely watch.  Those who see it won't forget it anytime soon - I think it is fully capable of inspiring a range of different emotions among viewers.All of the above was written immediately after I finished watching the film.  Since then, I have kept returning to this film many a time, and I just want to note the fact that Dil Ka Rishta grows much more endearing to me as time goes by.  Despite my misgivings about Jai, there can be no doubt of the love he feels for Tia (Rai), and that helps make Dil Ka Rishta a bittersweet yet beautiful romantic film.  This is a powerful love story that only Bollywood could tell - and, to repeat myself, the music is just exquisite.",5,"A beautiful, tragic, emotionally complicated film",1132790400,"11 24, 2005",2005,3516,"['have', 'conflicting', 'opinions', 'emotionally', 'complex', 'film', ""'ll"", 'try', 'dance', 'giving', 'story', 'away', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'easy', 'When', 'down', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'Dil', 'Ka', 'Rishta', 'less', 'five', 'stars', 'story', 'deep', 'compelling', 'acting', 'top-notch', 'Paresh', 'Rawal', 'particular', 'delight', 'music', 'incredible', 'cinematography', 'exquisite', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'even', 'more', 'gorgeous', 'usual', 'Isha', 'Koppikar', 'included', 'cast', 'film', 'lacking', 'nothing', 'radiant', 'beauty', 'only', 'problem', 'film', 'Jai', 'Arjun', 'Rampal', 'main', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'respect', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'falling', 'love', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'world', 'guy', 'even', 'less', 'women', 'do', 'least', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'woman', 'love', 'expensive', 'gifts', 'also', 'know', 'time', 'when', 'just', 'have', 'get', 'already', 'Go', 'ahead', 'wallow', 'self-pity', 'quite', 'while', 'get', 'life', 'think', 'happiness', 'woman', 'who', 'rejected', 'instead', 'just', 'Jai', 'needless', 'say', 'only', 'Then', 'something', 'truly', 'life-changing', 'happens', 'giving', 'Jai', 'second', 'chance', 'Tia', 'Rai', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'plot', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'review', 'opinion', 'Jai', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'shot', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'felt', 'little', 'sorry', 'emotional', 'issues', 'devastating', 'guilt', 'threaten', 'tear', 'apart', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'away', 'contemptible', 'book', 'Obviously', 'feelings', 'Jai', 'make', 'clear', 'Dil', 'Ka', 'Rishta', 'way', 'typical', 'romance', 'Love', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'complicated', 'here', 'make', 'powerful', 'storyline.I', 'love', 'single', 'piece', 'music', 'film', 'are', 'couple', 'wonderful', 'love', 'songs', 'including', 'title', 'track', 'played', 'out', 'front', 'breathtaking', 'scenes', 'natural', 'beauty', 'Dil', 'Chura', 'Le', 'tender', 'exquisite', 'love', 'song', 'Saajan', 'Saajan', 'also', 'love', 'energetic', 'well-choreographed', 'song', 'dance', 'featuring', 'Aishwarya', 'Then', 'Dayya', 'Dayya', 'Dayya', 'folks', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'song', 'special', 'really', 'Aishwarya', 'absolutely', 'smoking', 'multiple', 'costumes', 'course', 'performance.Dil', 'Ka', 'Rishta', 'feature', 'light', 'comedy', 'here', 'there', 'essence', 'extraordinarily', 'tragic', 'story', 'one', 'woman', 'two', 'lives', 'critics', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'accomplished', 'dramatic', 'actress', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'here', 'wish', 'could', 'better', 'describe', 'complexity', 'film', 'impossible', 'do', 'so', 'revealing', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'storyline', 'essence', 'film', 'experience', 'not', 'merely', 'watch', 'who', 'see', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'anytime', 'soon', 'think', 'fully', 'capable', 'inspiring', 'range', 'different', 'emotions', 'viewers.All', 'above', 'was', 'written', 'immediately', 'finished', 'watching', 'film', 'then', 'have', 'kept', 'returning', 'film', 'many', 'time', 'just', 'want', 'note', 'fact', 'Dil', 'Ka', 'Rishta', 'much', 'more', 'endearing', 'time', 'misgivings', 'Jai', 'can', 'be', 'doubt', 'love', 'Tia', 'Rai', 'make', 'Dil', 'Ka', 'Rishta', 'bittersweet', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'romantic', 'film', 'powerful', 'love', 'story', 'only', 'Bollywood', 'could', 'tell', 'repeat', 'music', 'just', 'exquisite']",N/A
765476,A21XVS00AIENLX,B0000APAEC,"G. Jennings ""G. J.""","[7, 7]","Quick synopsis:  Wealthy and extremely handsome Jai falls in love with Tia and professes his love for her only to find she already has a man in her life.  Regardless, smitten Jai persues Tia the best way he knows how by adorning her with gifts.  Tia is put off by Jai's wry attempts to buy her affections and with out hesitation marries Raj, has a son with him and proceeds to live a happy life.  Driven to drunkeness at the loss of his one true love, Jai, becomes the perpetrator of an unfortunate accident which causes Tia to lose her husband and her memory. Out of guilt and with the doctor's caution of Tia's fragile condition, Jai takes Tia and her young son into his home to make amends.  At long last, Jai's one true love is close to him, but he is forced to push her away for her own good.I agree with the former review on many aspects of this movie.  This is cinematically one of the most stylish Bollywood films put on screen.  The cast is nothing short of hot hot hot.  But I have to disagree with the former review about Jai.  I truly sympathise with his character.  He pines for Tia but he cannot have her. Raj becomes the unfortunate ""Yeoman Johnson"" of this film and merely serves as the required Bollywood love obstacle and a convenient catalyst that propels the movie forward. The intended lovers get closer together and then suddenly, as if snapping a book shut, everything comes to conclusion all at once.  That's where I rate this movie a four instead of a five.  The plot could have been a littler tighter. But the emotional strains felt by the characters are spot on.Great film to watch.  Shorter than the Bollywood standard of 3 hour movies. Great Man Candy in this film.

765477,A2PVZJY7E6454H,B0000APAEC,"Lyn ""Lyn""","[1, 1]",I wasnt sure where this movie was going in the beginning. We have another obsessed young man who so believes he has the handle on romantic destiny he can become a stalker and interfere with the choices of his 'true love'.It then looked like it may go into him actively causing mischief to achieve his aims.Then as the plot turned it became much more interesting and complex as he chooses not only to do the right and loving thing but deliberately not exploit a situation to have his needs met.I generally agree with other reviewers except to say I really like Arjun Rampal. He is very watchable and did a good job of managing the complexities of this character.I actually found Ashwaryia slightly less satisfying at times than she usually  is - as she seemed to be more consciously 'acting'.I also liked the development of the father-son relationship that felt both warm and real. They could have developed the part of the mother of Ash's character more though as she didnt have much to work with in what was setup to be a highly conflicted situation.This one is a bit shorter than a lot of the Bollywoods and I actually was left wanting more.This is both a decent story and good romance (when it becomes that rather than an obsession).,4,Worth a look,1228176000,"12 2, 2008",2008,1236,"['wasnt', 'sure', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'beginning', 'have', 'obsessed', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'handle', 'romantic', 'destiny', 'can', 'become', 'stalker', 'interfere', 'choices', ""love'.It"", 'then', 'looked', 'may', 'go', 'actively', 'causing', 'mischief', 'achieve', 'aims.Then', 'plot', 'turned', 'became', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'complex', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'right', 'loving', 'thing', 'deliberately', 'not', 'exploit', 'situation', 'have', 'needs', 'met.I', 'generally', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'say', 'really', 'Arjun', 'Rampal', 'very', 'watchable', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'managing', 'complexities', 'character.I', 'actually', 'found', 'Ashwaryia', 'slightly', 'less', 'satisfying', 'times', 'usually', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'consciously', ""'acting'.I"", 'also', 'liked', 'development', 'father-son', 'relationship', 'felt', 'warm', 'real', 'could', 'have', 'developed', 'part', 'mother', 'Ash', 'character', 'more', 'have', 'much', 'work', 'what', 'was', 'setup', 'be', 'highly', 'conflicted', 'situation.This', 'one', 'bit', 'shorter', 'lot', 'Bollywoods', 'actually', 'was', 'left', 'wanting', 'more.This', 'decent', 'story', 'good', 'romance', 'when', 'rather', 'obsession']",N/A

Jai's obsessive infatuation NOT love causes the death of 2 people, amnesia of Aishwarya Rai and the orphaning of a child and a mother losing her beloved son, who was really a wonderful loving husband and father. It is absurd and shocking  plot with the killer finally getting the target of his obsession. In real life he would be serving 20 years for manslaughter since he was driving under the influence. It reinforces that the criminal elite can literally can get away with murder. I felt no sympathy for Jai and I have no satisfaction that he got the beautiful Aishwarya at the end, this is a terrible message in a movie. I am not sure I have ever seen a plot so bizarre. It should have been rewritten with this handsome playboy looking man getting the girl of his dreams by some other legitimate means but certainly not by manslaughter; perhaps unfortunate death from a disease...something more noble.Sorry this is an immoral and disrespectful story which should never have been written.
