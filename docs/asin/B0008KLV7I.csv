If you're a zombie fan, it's definitely worth your time and money.For the most part, these are Romero zombies: Shoot 'em in the head types.It's the survivors who are different.  Who expects swingers to also be survivors??? I never had before, but THE STINK OF FLESH changed my mind.  Certainly it would take people willing to 'think outside the box' to survive the pending zombie apocalypse.My wife agreed that this was the rarity: a movie where you CAN'T predict what is going to happen next.  Wow!The acting is mixed.  Some of the co-stars seem lucky to have remembered their lines.  That's okay.

He even has a bit part in the movie as that old man with the son that the hero runs across on his travels.I'm not a huge fan of zombie flicks, but at the same time, I'll watch them when I'm in the mood. To me, zombies are still more icky bug than vampires or werewolves will ever be.Though there are the typical splatterfest scenes sprinkled throughout the action, there is plenty of wry humor and the main character has no problem glancing at the camera and giving the occasional smirk or raised eyebrow directly to the audience. It's all tongue-in-cheek and adds a charm to what could be just another low-budget zombie movie.In a lot of ways, it's like a wretched college movie project, but in this case, it is much more. I'd rate it higher and more entertaining than any of those big-budget slasher movies. In fact, it is just a notch below Sean of the Dead in entertainment value.Filmed entirely in New Mexico, on a shoestring budget, it demonstrates what miracles can be worked with a bit of imagination and a lot of improvisation.

But not at all dissapointing.Out of 10 stars it gets 6.2- The ZOMBIES- The make is very good, surprisingly good for the budget they worked with. Out of 10 stars 7.5.3-GORE- Plenty of it and very pleasing and well done, was definitly what made the movie.Out of 10 stars its gets 9.4-Action -there are alot of Zombie vs Human fights which is great.Out of 10 stars its gets 9.5-Humor-Not chessy and not dry, very cool and funny very enjoyable.Out of 10 stars its gets 9.Long story short amzons review is off the back cover and describes the movie as it is. This is a great movie to have. Me I love a good Zombie flick, and if you do also get it. You know you are getting a low budget indie flick so expect what you get, and what you will get is a very fun action packed bloody zombie flick that has plenty of laughs and plenty of gore.

899301,A2W82ICVTTYAOY,B0008KLV7I,Zombob,"[2, 2]","Jerry Springer with zombies!!1) ACTING: As always with a lot of indie flicks, the acting is usually hit or miss. For the most part, the leads in this movie were really good in their parts and there really wasn't anyone that seemed out of place, or distracting to the viewer. And Matool needs his own movie series!2) PRODUCTION: This was surprisingly good. Especially the zombies, which was nice. Normally, indie movie zombies consist of white face / dark eyes, with little to no facial applications, to almost regular looking skin tones with lots of fake blood, and no facial applicaiotns. Here, attention (and, obviously a good chunk of the budget) was spent on the zombies' make up and appearances. As far as low budget indies go, this one was pretty good. The script was tight (except for the ""quick! Let's tie up all the loose ends!"" at the movie's end), the subject matter--never seen before in a zombie movie, and the filming, editing, and soundtrack were okay as well.3) ZOMBIES: Other than the appearance of ""hyper-zombies,"" (think Snyder's DotD remake) nothing really new was brought to the zombie genre, and they did what most zombies usually do! (Except for some zombie-sex, but you'll have to see that for yourself!)4) THE CAUSE: Not mentioned.5) NUDITY: A movie about swingers with no nudity? C'mon!!Not bad, not bad at all...this is how low budget indies should be done. This was a fun little romp into ""alternative lifestyles"" land, with zombies brought along for the ride. I think that the production team really got the most out of their minimal budget. Many homages to other movies fill this movie, and I feel, add to the fun of it all. This could've easily been another ""zombies attack a small town"" movie that has ben done too many times before.
