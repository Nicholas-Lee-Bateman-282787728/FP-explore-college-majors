1597799,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B009LA1QSK,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[4, 7]","When I saw the box art for ""All Superheroes Must Die,"" the first thing that came to mind was ""Watchmen"" and ""Kick-Ass."" The two masked men on the cover reminded me of Ozymandias and Dave Lizewski because of their costumes. I was immediately intrigued when I read the synopsis and found out who directed, wrote, and starred in it.The name Jason Trost will be known to many quirky film lovers who delighted in ""The FP."" Who wouldn't want to see another project made by the guy who brought us a movie about an apocalyptic world where people fought to the death playing a sadistic form of ""Dance, Dance Revolution?"" I could only imagine where he would take the superhero genre with ""All Superheroes Must Die.""Four superheroes named Charge (Jason Trost), Cutthroat (Lucas Till), Shadow (Sophie Merkley), and The Wall (Lee Valmassy) wake up in what appears to be an abandoned town. They discover their super powers were taken away by their arch nemesis, Rickshaw (James Remar). The villain puts the heroes through a series of challenges that test both their mental and psychological strengths. They find themselves racing against the clock to save abducted civilians which Rickshaw is using in his insane game.""All Superheroes Must Die"" is a unique, dark, and twisted take on the genre it addresses. It's a little slow at times but delivers some great violent spurts and causes the viewer to think about the questionable actions the characters make throughout the film. The concept of superheroes dealing with saving people without their powers leads to some disturbing outcomes.I wasn't wrong in my initial comparisons to ""Watchmen"" and ""Kick-Ass"" as I perused the cover of the Blu-ray. The homemade costumes and colored language the heroes use heavily resembles the Minutemen and the empathetic characters in ""Kick-Ass."" Whether they were born with their powers or gained them later in life, these individuals are very ""human"" at heart.Everyone in ""All Superheroes Must Die"" put forth their best effort in their roles. James Remar (""Dexter"") portrays the villain Rickshaw with devilish delight. Jason Trost plays Charge successfully as a downtrodden hero who is mentally exhausted by his work. Lucas Till is in familiar territory as Cutthroat, having already starred as Havok in ""X-Men: First Class.""The audio and video for the high-definition transfer of this indie feature is better than one would expect for a movie made on less than a million dollars. The grimy and grainy feel of the film lends to its necessary bleak atmosphere. The clarity of Blu-ray takes nothing away from the movie. The 5.1 surround mix adequately blends the dialogue, sound effects, and electronic score together.A lack of any bonus material for the Blu-ray edition of ""All Superheroes Must Die"" is disheartening. After the great packaging for ""The FP,"" I expected more from this release. It would have been great to see a ""Making of"" featurette for the movie.Superhero fans of ""Watchmen"" and ""Kick-Ass"" will find something to appreciate in ""All Super Heroes Must Die."" They'll be especially pleased with its foundation in reality and violent sequences which bring to mind the newer ""Before Watchmen"" stories being told about the different members of the Minutemen. It does get bogged down in dialogue in some spots. One big complaint I have is that it ends abruptly leaving you unsatisfied.

Does anybody really think the script for X-Men: First Class was anything but horrible. The X Men's crappy script and mediocre acting is covered up by millions of dollars of CGI. This is true for so many of the new action films out there. ASMD was excellent for what they had to work with and I thought Jason Trost as the hero and James Remar as the the villain were excellent. Despite all the single stars I would suggest that individuals take a peek at this excellent little film. Is it an Oscar nominee? Certainly not but it is a fun little movie.

Ok, strictly speaking, there are superheroes in the film, but don't expect anything super.  They just talk gallons of sentences about what it is like to be a superhero.  Even the flashback sequences are replete with gabbing.  As for the superheroes without superpowers, the producer/writer/director team of Till and Trost would have done well to have remembered what made the TV series ""Heroes"" suck so bad so quickly in the first place:  removing the very thing from the principal characters that hooked viewers in the first place, those superpowers.  Making a film about powerless superheroes could have been a fine idea.  An interesting theme of whether power makes the man, or merely compliments the character could have been explored.  Instead, we get endless monologue and some kind of semblance of a relationship between two of the characters.  Don't kid yourself, however there is no love lost in this film; indeed, heart is the one true superpower missing from All Superheroes Must Die.  Instead we have what look like a bunch of freshman/sophmore college kids filming themselves while they are LARPing.  Which means that if you have uninteresting heroes, the one thing left is to turn to the bad guy, James Remar.

The DVD lacks any extras and as cheap as this thing was made, I was surprised it had scene jumps and a case. We are thrust into a story with zero character introduction. 4 superheroes in ripped wet suits,whose past we know nothing about, are suddenly placed into a game designed for them to lose, by a foe (James Remar) we know even less about.The heroes have been injected by (?) and their powers which we know nothing about, are gone except for John, who still has his strength which he never uses as he gets kicked around. There are black and white flashbacks which are meaningless. This film was written in four days and shot in 15, 10 hour segments. It is a stinker that lacks camp value as well.Unless you plan on playing the suggested drinking game that goes with this film (Google it) I must strongly urge you to avoid this one.Parental Guide: F-bombs.

1597815,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B009LA1QSK,Todd Smith,"[2, 2]","This film has one of the most original plots I've seen in a long time, however this film was panned by critics. After seeing All Superheroes Must Die, I really can't understand why it has one of the lowest IMDB ratings I've ever seen. It's nowhere near as good as it could have been, but it's certainly not as bad as most critics are making it out to be. Four superheroes wake up in an abandon town with their powers gone. Near them are TV sets, which explain that they have been captured by their arch-enemy, Rickshaw, and will be forced to play a game, in order to save the towns residence. The story is extremely original, but what I liked most about it was that the characters weren't over the top. The ""superheroes"" are actually normal twenty-somethings, who got powers from an object that fell from the sky. They are drinking, swearing, seemingly normal people, who were put into this impossible situation by a madman. Rickshaw is played by veteran character actor, James Remar, who was terrific. Parts of the film are slow and when things do slow down, Rickshaw, as clever as he is funny, is there to move things along. Jason Trost is the lead superhero, Charge, and he did a lot more than star in this thing, he wrote, produced, and directed it, which is a hard thing to do, especially for someone who doesn't have a lot of experience. The one knock I have against this film is that due to their small budget and independent status, much of the action scenes were very short. The challenges were clever, but by the time you understood what was going to happen, it was over. The film itself is very short, which doesn't allow them to go deeply into anything and that's what I think most people disliked about the film. It's not that this was a bad movie, it's that it really could have been a whole lot more.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1383350400,"11 2, 2013",2013,1815,"['film', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'plots', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'however', 'film', 'was', 'panned', 'critics', 'seeing', 'Superheroes', 'Must', 'Die', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'one', 'lowest', 'IMDB', 'ratings', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'certainly', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'most', 'critics', 'are', 'making', 'be', 'Four', 'superheroes', 'wake', 'up', 'abandon', 'town', 'powers', 'gone', 'are', 'TV', 'sets', 'explain', 'have', 'been', 'captured', 'arch-enemy', 'Rickshaw', 'will', 'be', 'forced', 'play', 'game', 'order', 'save', 'towns', 'residence', 'story', 'extremely', 'original', 'what', 'liked', 'most', 'was', 'characters', 'were', ""n't"", 'top', 'superheroes', 'are', 'actually', 'normal', 'twenty-somethings', 'who', 'got', 'powers', 'object', 'fell', 'sky', 'are', 'drinking', 'swearing', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'put', 'impossible', 'situation', 'madman', 'Rickshaw', 'played', 'veteran', 'character', 'actor', 'James', 'Remar', 'who', 'was', 'terrific', 'Parts', 'film', 'are', 'slow', 'when', 'things', 'do', 'slow', 'down', 'Rickshaw', 'as', 'clever', 'funny', 'there', 'move', 'things', 'along', 'Jason', 'Trost', 'lead', 'superhero', 'Charge', 'did', 'lot', 'more', 'star', 'thing', 'wrote', 'produced', 'directed', 'hard', 'thing', 'do', 'especially', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'experience', 'one', 'knock', 'have', 'film', 'due', 'small', 'budget', 'independent', 'status', 'much', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'very', 'short', 'challenges', 'were', 'clever', 'time', 'understood', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'was', 'over', 'film', 'very', 'short', ""n't"", 'allow', 'go', 'deeply', 'anything', 'what', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'disliked', 'film', 'not', 'was', 'bad', 'movie', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'whole', 'lot', 'more']",N/A
