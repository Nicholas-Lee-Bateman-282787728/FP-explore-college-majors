1024394,A1O4HZ9HNGDB0A,B000J3FBUM,"Laird M. Wilcox ""Nitewriter""","[1, 1]","I loved the first film - which I watched several times -- and enjoyed the second film, but I got lost as the series progressed.  I thought the filming was very good, although I have a bias toward black-and-white films.  On the other hand I thought there was too much fighting and swordplay but this is a problem with most samurai movies.  You can get the impression that all these guys did back then was chop each other up when that&#8217;s not really the case.  On the other hand these are movies to entertain the public and not documentary films.I have over 250 Japanese movies, most of them made during the 1960s and before.  All of these are subtitled and you actually have to watch the movie with your eyes to follow it.  If you pay close attention it&#8217;s quite another experience.  It also pays to watch the film more than once.  You will see things the second time around you didn&#8217;t even notice the first, and the same is true with the third time.It's not like English language films where you can do something else while you're &#34;watching&#34; the film, step away from the monitor for a bit or otherwise be inattentive.  You have to follow the subtitles or you miss much of the movie.  If you do this there are a lot of very good Japanese films out there.  Otherwise you just won't quite get it.",4,"Loved the first film, liked the second but got a bit lost with the third and fourth.

That's right, all 4 of the films take place in the woods almost 95% of the time.  As if it weren't boring enough with crappy action sequences and lame story.  Don't waste your money.  I agree that Aoi and Kageru were good in the film, but I wish I had seen them first in something else.  And the film did look like it was filmed by a soccer mom with a camcorder.  The overall quality is just bad.
