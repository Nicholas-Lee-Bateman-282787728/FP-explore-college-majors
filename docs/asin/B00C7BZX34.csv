The musical score seems to be one long violin note.  It's hard to care about the characters, particularly the brat son.  One reviewer questioned the need for the auto store robbery scene.  I disagree.  It shows, early on, just how much of a self centered brat the younger son is.I may I'm biased, having grown up trailer-trash like the brat's girlfriend, against farm kids who complain about inhereting multi-million dollar businesses (around $3M in just the land).  I rode to school on the bus, not in a tax-deductible pickup truck filled with tax-free gas.I have to commend the makeup department.

1643134,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00C7BZX34,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 3]","AT ANY PRICE (2013, 105 minutes) is the revolting tale of greedy Iowa seed vendor and farmer Henry Whipple (Dennis Quaid)--a man with a nasty past, and a rotten presence to say the least. To describe him a bit better, I will use the term ""oily, stinking weasel"". His worthless younger son (Zac Efron, if you can believe it) will disgust the viewer even more.Essentially, this is the story of one bad apple out of a driven group of businessmen--farm seed vendors--set near Decatur, Iowa (it was filmed in DeKalb, Illinois and for some reason I found even that to be a red flag). When the seed company from which Henry Whipple bought his seed gets a tip-off about certain contractual violations, things spin out of control. The entire Whipple family goes nuts (not too far to go, for them). It ends in murder. Frankly, I was deeply offended that this film was even conceived, let alone that it was made.It is an ugly, graphic, stupid and deeply ignorant condemnation of the people of the American heartland--a place and a people who live mere hours from me. A land where I was born and raised. Certain scenes were shot at locations where I have been many times. So this film, as a 'morality play', was simply ""hate America"" all the way. Cinematically, the acting was top-grade, I suppose; but I have to ask, to what end? If a morality play, how can you show me this ugly, pointless film with no morals in and of itself?In its effort to show the immorality of Americans in the heartland at any price, it showed its own true, evil, meaningless face. In other words, you cannot make a film like this unless you TRIED to make precisely this kind of film. So I have to wonder why the filmmaker hates us so much. And please don't insult our intelligence by saying this is fiction, this is allegory, symbolic, metaphorical. It is a gross insult unlike anything I have ever seen in my long film-watching life.The entire time I was expecting this film to explode in a different direction. There are ""corporate whistle-blowing"" films and I usually love that type of film. This film utterly failed to clearly explain what Whipple had done with the exactness the audience needed--most of us are not farmers--and of course it failed to represent the people. Were I a farmer or seed man or any other remotely related worker, I'd have been even more deeply offended and insulted by this.It made me ask why Quaid and especially Zac Efron would participate in such a thing. I know Quaid to be a good, conscientious man and philanthropist, and my guess is the filmmaking was originally well-intentioned. What little I know about Efron tells me he made every wrong mistake he could have possibly made by being in this movie. For a film to excoriate and ostracize even a small group of families in this way is an insult to the entire nation.We are not a perfect planet of perfect beings. I am not a right-wing fascist republican and I am not in favor of extreme or illegal censorship. But a film like AT ANY PRICE makes me wonder what kind of person it takes to conceive of and produce a stinking, horrible movie like this.",1,"Cinematic greed, bad taste and an insult to the nation at any price and NO, I will not give more stars, I wish I could give 0!",1386979200,"12 14, 2013",2013,3101,"['AT', 'ANY', 'PRICE', '2013', '105', 'minutes', 'revolting', 'tale', 'greedy', 'Iowa', 'seed', 'vendor', 'farmer', 'Henry', 'Whipple', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'man', 'nasty', 'past', 'rotten', 'presence', 'say', 'least', 'describe', 'bit', 'better', 'will', 'use', 'term', 'oily', 'stinking', 'weasel', 'worthless', 'younger', 'son', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'can', 'believe', 'will', 'disgust', 'viewer', 'even', 'more.Essentially', 'story', 'one', 'bad', 'apple', 'driven', 'group', 'businessmen', 'farm', 'seed', 'vendors', 'set', 'Decatur', 'Iowa', 'was', 'filmed', 'DeKalb', 'Illinois', 'reason', 'found', 'even', 'be', 'red', 'flag', 'When', 'seed', 'company', 'Henry', 'Whipple', 'bought', 'seed', 'tip-off', 'certain', 'contractual', 'violations', 'things', 'spin', 'control', 'entire', 'Whipple', 'family', 'nuts', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'go', 'murder', 'Frankly', 'was', 'deeply', 'offended', 'film', 'was', 'even', 'conceived', 'let', 'alone', 'was', 'made.It', 'ugly', 'graphic', 'stupid', 'deeply', 'ignorant', 'condemnation', 'people', 'American', 'heartland', 'place', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'mere', 'hours', 'land', 'where', 'was', 'born', 'raised', 'Certain', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'locations', 'where', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'times', 'film', ""'morality"", 'play', 'was', 'simply', 'hate', 'America', 'way', 'Cinematically', 'acting', 'was', 'top-grade', 'suppose', 'have', 'ask', 'what', 'end', 'morality', 'play', 'how', 'can', 'show', 'ugly', 'pointless', 'film', 'morals', 'effort', 'show', 'immorality', 'Americans', 'heartland', 'price', 'showed', 'own', 'true', 'evil', 'meaningless', 'face', 'other', 'words', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'film', 'TRIED', 'make', 'precisely', 'kind', 'film', 'So', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'filmmaker', 'so', 'much', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'insult', 'intelligence', 'saying', 'fiction', 'allegory', 'symbolic', 'metaphorical', 'gross', 'insult', 'anything', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'long', 'film-watching', 'life.The', 'entire', 'time', 'was', 'expecting', 'film', 'explode', 'different', 'direction', 'are', 'corporate', 'whistle-blowing', 'films', 'usually', 'love', 'type', 'film', 'film', 'utterly', 'failed', 'clearly', 'explain', 'what', 'Whipple', 'had', 'done', 'exactness', 'audience', 'needed', 'most', 'are', 'not', 'farmers', 'course', 'failed', 'represent', 'people', 'Were', 'farmer', 'seed', 'man', 'other', 'remotely', 'related', 'worker', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'even', 'more', 'deeply', 'offended', 'insulted', 'this.It', 'made', 'ask', 'why', 'Quaid', 'especially', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'would', 'participate', 'such', 'thing', 'know', 'Quaid', 'be', 'good', 'conscientious', 'man', 'philanthropist', 'guess', 'filmmaking', 'was', 'originally', 'well-intentioned', 'What', 'little', 'know', 'Efron', 'tells', 'made', 'wrong', 'mistake', 'could', 'have', 'possibly', 'made', 'being', 'movie', 'film', 'excoriate', 'ostracize', 'even', 'small', 'group', 'families', 'way', 'insult', 'entire', 'nation.We', 'are', 'not', 'perfect', 'planet', 'perfect', 'beings', 'am', 'not', 'right-wing', 'fascist', 'republican', 'am', 'not', 'favor', 'extreme', 'illegal', 'censorship', 'film', 'AT', 'ANY', 'PRICE', 'wonder', 'what', 'kind', 'person', 'conceive', 'produce', 'stinking', 'horrible', 'movie']",N/A

1643136,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00C7BZX34,Grady Harp,"[4, 5]","Note: possible Spoiler AlertYes, this quote actually comes out of the mouth of one of the more irresponsible self-serving egocentric characters created for a film - one Henry Whipple. And that is only for starters. This mess of a film (written by Hallie Newton and adapted for the screen by writer/director Ramin Bahrani) is an American Midwest epic about crime down on the farm, but no one seems to notice that is the topic.  It reminds us of that old Midwest saying `He's so dumb he couldn't pour pee out of a side-laced boot with the directions written on the heel'.Henry Whipple (Dennis Quaid) inherited a family corn farm and continues the long family tradition of making it a success in Iowa - even to the point of becoming involved in a criminal malfeasance that has to do with seed. He has two sons - All American athlete Grant (Patrick W. Stevens), who has wisely left this station to climb mountains in Argentina, and Dean (Zac Efron), who hates the farm and loves destruction derby car racing and glibly tells his father he will have nothing to do with the `family farm inheritance' - and a wife (Kim Dickens) who is so passive that her only positive gesture, other than serving lemonade to the annual customer appreciation crowd, is to give Dean $15,000 to join the racing industry - a waste because Dean is unprepared to cope with his dream. Henry womanizes with Meredith (Heather Graham)  - so does Dean - but that's OK. Dean robs and murders, but that's OK. And when the Whipple farm faces a possible end, Henry lies his way out of it with some wimpy reparation and more lemonade and dancing at the customer appreciation picnic. Even Dean's abused well-meaning girlfriend (Maika Monroe) is able to just smile and move on. The only character who seems to have some respect is our mountain climbing Grant who has left this weakened family. End.It might be possible to simple label this flimsy little film as boring, but it is so meaningless and mean-spirited that it likely will cause a mix of anger and disgust in the viewer.

Not only is the acting by Dennis Quaid one of his worst performances, but the story is severely lacking in all areas! The writers decided to throw everything and the kitchen sink into this one. Farming, sex, adultery, murder, car racing, mountain climbing, guns, robbery, alcohol, suicide, F-bombs, kidnapping/missing person, death, fist fighting.......Spoilers: I have been around farmers my whole life and they certainly do not behave they way this movie portrays them. Yes, they do sit in air conditioned, GPS guided equipment. No, they do not commit murder in corn fields and toss the body into their well (water is precious you know). Yes, GMO seeds are highly regulated and watched by seed goons who WILL come after you. No, farmers are not going to have an adulterous affair out in the middle of the day in public. No gun blasted robbery would go unnoticed and never investigated (sort of like the murder above). Sex in a corn silo is unsafe and should probably not be attempted (with protection or otherwise). Yes, seed cleaners have all been put out of business. No, farmers do not drive around in gold Chevy Impalas!For such a ""star studded"" cast, this movie falls short by miles. It is slow, boring, long, drawn out, and just plain not entertaining. There is no back story to any of it. Why is the oldest son leaving the farm to go climb Mt Everest or whatever mountain it is he climbs? Why does the other son freak out while racing? It's his life dream and he's good at it.

1643143,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00C7BZX34,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","In one of his best performances, Dennis Quaid plays a midsized corporate farmer named Henry Whipple (wasn't he the Charmin salesman?).  While he has his own farm in Iowa he is also a seed salesman for a big company called Liberty (think Monsanto).  To be honest I don't know how all this works but from what I gather, the  way of washing old (natural) seed and replanting has been supplanted by genetically modified seed that must be purchased new each year.  That really is just the backdrop in any case.Henry and his wife, Irene (Kim Dickens) have two sons.  Grant, the high school star quarterback heads off to a successful career at Iowa State but doesn't return to the farming empire he was expected to inherit.  Instead he goes off to climb mountains.  The younger son, isn't the high school star that his brother was.  He is however an up-and-coming stock car racer and has been highly successful at the local figure 8 track.  This ""hobby"" has never gotten the attention of his parents as his older brother's sports did and it has been a bone of contention.It seems that the film was going to go in one of two directions.  One was to get more into the intricacies of how and why genetically modified seed is used and sold.  Perhaps an expose on how large corporations are impacting smaller farmers.  The other avenue is to expand the relationship between Henry and his stock-car driving son who like his brother, wants no part of the business.  The story heads in that direction but is constantly sidetracked by heightened melodrama involving secondary characters.For example, Henry is having an affair from an old high school sweetheart (Heather Graham).  You know, he was the stud QB, she was the head cheerleader (yawn).  When she is eventually spurned, she turns her attention to young son and car racer Dean (Zac Efron).  Then there is the whole wannabe NASCAR thing.  And the contractual subterfuge Henry was trying to pull off.I do give credit for the secondary relationship between Henry and Dean's high school girlfriend Cadence (Maika Monroe).

1643145,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00C7BZX34,Paul Allaer,"[14, 14]","""At Any Price"" (2013  release; 105 min.) brings the story of Henry (played by Dennis Quaid) and his farm family in Iowa. Henry owns a big farm and sells genetically-modified seeds, and is struggling to keep this 4th generation farm going. His oldest son Grant has left the family for adventures abroad (mountain climbing in Argentina) and his youngest son Dean (played by Zac Efron) is a dirt track racer dreaming to break into the big times (ARCA, then NASCAR). Henry is losing customers to a rival, but is unexpectedly getting some help from Dean's girlfriend Cadence (played by Maika Monroe). Henry also has a girlfriend on the side, Meredith (played by Heather Graham), who in turn has her eyes on Dean. Then one day, Henry gets investigated by Liberty, the company from which Henry gets his seeds, for possibly cleaning/re-using the seeds for more than one crop. To tell you more of this plot-heavy movie would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first, the plot at times seens contrived, almost soap-like, but somehow it all works out well as the movie progresses. Of more interest are the performances. Zac Efron continues to try and evolve away from his early Disney days, building on his most recent role in ""The Paperboy"" (where ho co-starred with Nicole Kidman). I am a huge fan of Heather Graham, but she is under-used, and type-cast, as the sexy siren. Dennis Quaid gets the better of the deal as he gets to show his chops as the tormented and frustrated farmer/dad/lover. But the breakout role is from Maika Monroe, a new-comer for me, as the girlfriend of Dean, I am looking forward to seeing her in future roles! Bottom line: this is an entertaining family farm drama, warts and all. As a complete aside, there was a recent Supreme Court case on this very issue of farmers re-using genetically modified seeds for a second or third crop without paying the seeds manufacturers (the farmer lost the case).This movie showed up unannounced in the art-house theatre here in Cincinnati on a single screen and when I went to see it this weekend, I got a private showing, literally, as I was the only person in the theatre. I figure this won't play long here, but glad I saw it.
