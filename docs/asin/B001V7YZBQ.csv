1243241,A1GR2QPCD08COG,B001V7YZBQ,AlphaDog,"[0, 0]","I found this DVD when I went in search of an alternative for my kickboxing DVD (I believe Lori Dean HITS is no longer available). I must say that I like the workout and the intensity of the work out depends on your level of fitness although I think that even moderate to advanced folks looking for a good quick workout can easily modify these exercises to increase their level of difficulty.I won't describe the details of the specific segments because other reviewers have done so already (excellent review details by the way) but I will describe why I gave it four stars instead of five: The transitions between some, not all, of the exercises, while they are not difficult they can cause some strain especially if you're just starting out or a beginner or have problems with knees and ankles. Some of the transitions are fast and one out of all the combinations was a little confusing even for me. This was in the second 20 minute workout of the DVD which is all cardio. I usually select ""Play all"" which leads me to one slight negative of the dvd menu. When you select ""play all"" it plays the short introduction to the segment. I don't mind it that much because I use this as a recovery period or a quick minute to hydrate.One of the many strengths of the dvd is that it combines cardio with muscle conditioning (you need 3-5 pound weights). Zaki takes you through a warm up and then you hit cardio and switch to muscle conditioning and then cardio and so on. If you've ever done a work out where you switch between a brisk walk and gentle jog this is very similar in that respect. During one of the cardio routines, at least for me, I've had to modify the transition even further. Punching and turning to the sides, for some reason, caused a catch on my ankle, even though I know that in boxing and kickboxing (and I do practice both), one must ""be on your toes"" literally. Be light on your toes. When you're turning and moving and punching, you must be ever aware of what you're feet are doing, don't glue them down to the floor. I know this and for some reason, my ankle still gave me a jolt.Zaki is average about warning you on good technique when it comes to certain exercises but I didn't find her instruction that detailed in terms of safety with other moves and transitions. It helps if you have a kickboxing or boxing knowledge or have learned techniques from other kickboxing dvds so that you work out safely. I believe this DVD assumes that you already have this knowledge. If you're unsure about the safety of any moves, i definitely recommend that you watch the video several times before you attempt any of the moves.As I said before most of the combinations are simple and easy and they make sense. with one or two exceptions, the moves from one exercise is either too fast or two awkward. Another strength of the video is that Zaki works out along side two other athletes, one working at the same level as Zaki and the other a modified version. It helps if you're starting out.Overall I enjoyed this DVD. You get two 20 minute workouts and so for those days you want to challenge yourself you play both segments and you get a 50 minute workout, which includes the warm up and the cool down. Of course you can modify up or down (weights or not weights) to adjust the work out to your level of fitness.",4,low impact kardio with kickboxing techniques,1378166400,"09 3, 2013",2013,3320,"['found', 'DVD', 'when', 'went', 'search', 'alternative', 'kickboxing', 'DVD', 'believe', 'Lori', 'Dean', 'HITS', 'no', 'longer', 'available', 'must', 'say', 'like', 'workout', 'intensity', 'work', 'out', 'depends', 'level', 'fitness', 'think', 'even', 'moderate', 'advanced', 'folks', 'looking', 'good', 'quick', 'workout', 'can', 'easily', 'modify', 'exercises', 'increase', 'level', 'difficulty.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'describe', 'details', 'specific', 'segments', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'already', 'excellent', 'review', 'details', 'way', 'will', 'describe', 'why', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'transitions', 'not', 'exercises', 'are', 'not', 'difficult', 'can', 'cause', 'strain', 'especially', ""'re"", 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'beginner', 'have', 'problems', 'knees', 'ankles', 'transitions', 'are', 'fast', 'one', 'out', 'combinations', 'was', 'little', 'confusing', 'even', 'was', 'second', '20', 'minute', 'workout', 'DVD', 'cardio', 'usually', 'select', 'Play', 'one', 'slight', 'negative', 'dvd', 'menu', 'When', 'select', 'play', 'short', 'introduction', 'segment', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'that', 'much', 'use', 'recovery', 'period', 'quick', 'minute', 'hydrate.One', 'many', 'strengths', 'dvd', 'cardio', 'muscle', 'conditioning', 'need', '3-5', 'pound', 'weights', 'Zaki', 'warm', 'up', 'then', 'hit', 'cardio', 'switch', 'muscle', 'conditioning', 'then', 'cardio', 'so', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'done', 'work', 'out', 'where', 'switch', 'brisk', 'walk', 'gentle', 'jog', 'very', 'similar', 'respect', 'one', 'cardio', 'routines', 'least', ""'ve"", 'had', 'modify', 'transition', 'even', 'further', 'Punching', 'turning', 'sides', 'reason', 'caused', 'catch', 'ankle', 'even', 'know', 'boxing', 'kickboxing', 'do', 'practice', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'toes', 'literally', 'Be', 'light', 'toes', 'When', ""'re"", 'turning', 'moving', 'punching', 'must', 'be', 'ever', 'aware', 'what', ""'re"", 'feet', 'are', 'doing', 'do', ""n't"", 'glue', 'down', 'floor', 'know', 'reason', 'ankle', 'still', 'gave', 'jolt.Zaki', 'average', 'warning', 'good', 'technique', 'when', 'certain', 'exercises', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'instruction', 'detailed', 'terms', 'safety', 'other', 'moves', 'transitions', 'have', 'kickboxing', 'boxing', 'knowledge', 'have', 'learned', 'techniques', 'other', 'kickboxing', 'dvds', 'so', 'work', 'out', 'safely', 'believe', 'DVD', 'already', 'have', 'knowledge', ""'re"", 'unsure', 'safety', 'moves', 'i', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'watch', 'video', 'several', 'times', 'attempt', 'moves.As', 'said', 'most', 'combinations', 'are', 'simple', 'easy', 'make', 'sense', 'one', 'two', 'exceptions', 'moves', 'one', 'exercise', 'either', 'too', 'fast', 'two', 'awkward', 'strength', 'video', 'Zaki', 'out', 'along', 'side', 'two', 'other', 'athletes', 'one', 'working', 'same', 'level', 'Zaki', 'other', 'modified', 'version', ""'re"", 'starting', 'out.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'get', 'two', '20', 'minute', 'workouts', 'so', 'days', 'want', 'challenge', 'play', 'segments', 'get', '50', 'minute', 'workout', 'warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down', 'course', 'can', 'modify', 'up', 'down', 'weights', 'not', 'weights', 'adjust', 'work', 'out', 'level', 'fitness']",WEIGHT LOSS CARDIO KICK

This is the first workout DVD of hers that I have done but I am already looking for others.  What I love about the DVD is that Violet is very encouraging with out being sappy or barking at you.  Unlike some other instructors she does each segment right along with you and reminds you to breathe, keep correct form, and to see the workout through to the end.  She also instructs you to say each move as you do it...jab, hook, right kick, etc. which definetely helps those who are less than coordinated.  I've had to keep myself from doing this DVD everyday because I really do enjoy it.  There are two other women working out, one for low impact/beginners and the other who keeps up with Violet doing higher impact/advanced.  Either way you will be sweating within minutes!

I'm an intermediate exerciser and found it to be a good workout that made me sweat.  I did the entire thing, but you can break it down into different combinations, depending on how much time you have that day (20-50 minutes).  Unlike most videos, this has a good warm up and cool down.  It has a combination of kickboxing, bootcamp-type drills, and weights.  The majority of moves are kickboxing.  You do moves that work upper body, lower body, or both at same time.  I felt Violet Zacki did an okay, but not great job cueing.  I think because I have done kickboxing before I was able to catch on quickly.  I have also tried Violet Zaki's ""The Trainer's Edge with Violet Zaki: Killer Kicks"" and like this video much better.

I suppose if you belong to that set that likes MTV so much you don't care about getting a real workout, you might be impressed by the fact that the instructor seems to be small and her foot gigantic when it kicks straight at you, or you might enjoy the blurriness of the action.

1243247,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B001V7YZBQ,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[53, 53]","NOTE: I received a free review copy of this DVD from the web site Metapsychology Online.This DVD is led by Violet Zaki, who holds a black belt in karate.  She works out with two background exercises, one of whom shows lower impact modifications for some of the moves.  The cover of this DVD states that it provides ""2 20-Minute Fat-Blasting Workouts"" although there are actually several different options for customizing your workout experience.  The Main Menu includes an Introduction, Workout Options (described below), Bonus Features (including kickboxing tutorial for those unfamiliar with the punches and kicks used), Also from Acacia, and Credits.  If you select Workout Options, you are taken to a submenu screen which provides the various workout choices.  First, there is a ""Play All"" option (51m), allowing you to play both 20-minute workouts back-to-back along with the separate Warm-Up (5m) and Cool-Down (6m) chapters.  Next, you can select each of the two workouts, Power Sculpt (20m) and Drills & Combos (20m), individually, with the option of playing them either with or without Zaki's brief introductions (&lt;2m).  As mentioned above, the Warm-Up and Cool-Down are chaptered separately, so these can be selected from the submenu screen as well.In the Warm-Up, Zaki basically just introduces the various punches and kicks used throughout the workout one by one.  The standard punches include jab, cross, hook, and uppercut, while there are three basic kicks, front, back, and roundhouse.  If you have chosen the Play All option, the Power Sculpt workout comes first.  The general pattern for the Power Sculpt workout is that Zaki begins with a ""heavy"" weights exercise, usually a dynamic movement that keeps the heart rate up.  She follows this by a series of either punches or kicking movements using lighter weights.  Finally, there is a ""cardio blast"" segment--for example, one combination included jumping jacks, jump rope, side-to-side shuffles, and front-to-back shuffles.  This sequence of heavy weights--light weights--cardio blast is repeated several times throughout the Power Sculpt session, which ends with a ""pure cardio"" segment.The Drills & Combos portion is all cardio; Zaki instructs simple punch-kick sequences here.  She begins with an all-punch combination:  jab-cross-hook-upper-double jab-cross-shuffle.  Next, she moves on to an all-kick routine, first beginning with a basic front kick-back kick, but then upping both the difficulty and the complexity level by adding in jumping jacks, a side squat, and a roundhouse kick facing the side.  From this point on, Zaki blends the punches and kicks to form mixed combinations, but for the most part, she keeps the choreography relatively straightforward.  Some of the moves are even a bit fun and different, such as a side-to-side punch (which actually appears in both workouts) and a double block with a squat.  The Cool-Down features Asian-inspired music as Zaki leads you through stretches for all of the major muscle groups that were worked, including the quads, hamstrings, and shoulders.  She concludes the Cool-Down with a move borrowed from yoga, side angle pose, for a complete full body stretch.These workouts are appropriate for beginning to intermediate exercisers:  beginners can take it easy by following the modifier and and sticking with only one 20-minute workout to start, whereas intermediate exercises can up the challenge by performing the entire 51-minute routine, using heavier dumbbells, and even adding weighted gloves for the cardio segment.  This is a solid workout with a good amount of versatility, and I would definitely recommend it.",4,Solid kickboxing workout offers options for beginners to intermediates,1257638400,"11 8, 2009",2009,3650,"['NOTE', 'received', 'free', 'review', 'copy', 'DVD', 'web', 'site', 'Metapsychology', 'Online.This', 'DVD', 'led', 'Violet', 'Zaki', 'who', 'black', 'belt', 'karate', 'out', 'two', 'background', 'exercises', 'one', 'whom', 'shows', 'lower', 'impact', 'modifications', 'moves', 'cover', 'DVD', '2', '20-Minute', 'Fat-Blasting', 'Workouts', 'are', 'actually', 'several', 'different', 'options', 'customizing', 'workout', 'experience', 'Main', 'Menu', 'Introduction', 'Options', 'described', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'including', 'kickboxing', 'tutorial', 'unfamiliar', 'punches', 'kicks', 'used', 'Also', 'Acacia', 'Credits', 'select', 'Options', 'are', 'taken', 'submenu', 'screen', 'various', 'workout', 'choices', 'First', 'Play', 'All', 'option', '51m', 'allowing', 'play', '20-minute', 'workouts', 'back-to-back', 'separate', 'Warm-Up', '5m', 'Cool-Down', '6m', 'chapters', 'Next', 'can', 'select', 'two', 'workouts', 'Power', 'Sculpt', '20m', 'Drills', 'Combos', '20m', 'individually', 'option', 'playing', 'Zaki', 'brief', 'introductions', 'lt', '2m', 'mentioned', 'Warm-Up', 'Cool-Down', 'are', 'chaptered', 'separately', 'can', 'be', 'selected', 'submenu', 'screen', 'well.In', 'Warm-Up', 'Zaki', 'basically', 'just', 'various', 'punches', 'kicks', 'used', 'workout', 'one', 'one', 'standard', 'punches', 'include', 'jab', 'cross', 'hook', 'uppercut', 'are', 'three', 'basic', 'kicks', 'front', 'back', 'roundhouse', 'have', 'chosen', 'Play', 'All', 'option', 'Power', 'Sculpt', 'workout', 'first', 'general', 'pattern', 'Power', 'Sculpt', 'workout', 'Zaki', 'heavy', 'weights', 'exercise', 'usually', 'dynamic', 'movement', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'series', 'punches', 'kicking', 'movements', 'using', 'lighter', 'weights', 'Finally', 'cardio', 'blast', 'segment', 'example', 'one', 'combination', 'included', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'jump', 'rope', 'side-to-side', 'shuffles', 'front-to-back', 'shuffles', 'sequence', 'heavy', 'weights', 'light', 'weights', 'cardio', 'blast', 'repeated', 'several', 'times', 'Power', 'Sculpt', 'session', 'pure', 'cardio', 'segment.The', 'Drills', 'Combos', 'portion', 'cardio', 'Zaki', 'simple', 'punch-kick', 'sequences', 'here', 'all-punch', 'combination', 'jab-cross-hook-upper-double', 'jab-cross-shuffle', 'Next', 'all-kick', 'routine', 'first', 'beginning', 'basic', 'front', 'kick-back', 'kick', 'then', 'upping', 'difficulty', 'complexity', 'level', 'adding', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'side', 'squat', 'roundhouse', 'kick', 'facing', 'side', 'point', 'Zaki', 'punches', 'kicks', 'form', 'mixed', 'combinations', 'most', 'part', 'choreography', 'relatively', 'straightforward', 'moves', 'are', 'even', 'bit', 'fun', 'different', 'such', 'side-to-side', 'punch', 'actually', 'workouts', 'double', 'block', 'squat', 'Cool-Down', 'features', 'Asian-inspired', 'music', 'Zaki', 'stretches', 'major', 'muscle', 'groups', 'were', 'worked', 'including', 'quads', 'hamstrings', 'shoulders', 'Cool-Down', 'move', 'borrowed', 'yoga', 'side', 'angle', 'pose', 'complete', 'full', 'body', 'stretch.These', 'workouts', 'are', 'appropriate', 'beginning', 'intermediate', 'exercisers', 'beginners', 'can', 'take', 'easy', 'following', 'modifier', 'sticking', 'only', 'one', '20-minute', 'workout', 'start', 'whereas', 'intermediate', 'exercises', 'can', 'up', 'challenge', 'performing', 'entire', '51-minute', 'routine', 'using', 'heavier', 'dumbbells', 'even', 'adding', 'weighted', 'gloves', 'cardio', 'segment', 'solid', 'workout', 'good', 'amount', 'versatility', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend']",WEIGHT LOSS CARDIO KICK

I started doing just the cardio one (all kickboxing), and boy did it make me sweat.  After doing that one several times, I switched to the Power Sculpt workout (I was intimidated to try it at first), and that made me sweat just as much (and I found I had nothing to be afraid of!).  Of the two, I really, really, REALLY like the kickboxing segment.  It's almost like I can feel the pounds melting away as I'm doing it.Pros:  What I really love about these workouts is how many calories I burn. Also, just about the time I'm starting to lose my breath, Violet stops and gives you a minute to breathe.  That's what makes these workouts so doable.  I also like how Violet works you up into the full moves, i.e., jab, then cross, then jab and cross, then hook, then upper-cut, then hook and upper-cut, etc., then you put them ALL together.Also, the warm-up and cool-down with these workouts is AWESOME.  Much better than what Jillian Michaels gives you (in my opinion).  They are by far the longest of all the workout DVDs I've tried (I think another reviewer has mentioned that as well).  I like that.  I really feel stretched and relaxed after completing one of these workouts and the subsequent cool-down.Cons:  I do wish these workouts were a little longer.  Due to their short length I've gotten in the habit of doing an interval training workout, followed by one of these workouts.

To put it in perspective, I was not challenged by the majority of Jillian Michaels' ""Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism""; Bob Harper's ""Bob Rev: Cardio Conditioning,"" in comparison, kicked my butt, though I was able to complete it. I'd probably actually give this workout a 3.5 stars because, though it was pretty easy for me, I did really like the instructor. The cardio portion kicked it up some, but the sculpting was at a very beginner level in my opinion. I do a lot of Firm dvds, and their strength training moves are typically much more challenging than those on this dvd. I'll use this as a lighter day workout because I do like Violet. Really can't stand the permanent fake smiles on the exercisers, though I did appreciate seeing women who weren't stick-thin Barbie dolls. I don't know why so many workout dvds think they have to have the exercisers smiling the whole time while acting as though they're working hard. When I'm working hard, I'm not smiling constantly. In comparison to Tae Bo, I prefer Billy Blanks' energy, but Violet doesn't drone on about herself and her accomplishments, so I prefer this dvd to any of the Tae Bo ones that I've done.

I'm so glad I tried this workout DVD; it did make me sweat. The moves are easy to follow (sometimes too easy), but Violet Zaki (the instructor) doesn't let you stop, which is where the cardio comes in. You can follow along quickly; I didn't have to spend time trying to master the moves. You don't do each exercise for too long so if one exercise is hard, she'll quickly move onto a new one.The video breaks down into 2 parts: Power Sculpt (where you'll use weights), and Drills and Combos (all kickboxing).The Power Sculpt incorporates both weights with kickboxing, and you'll really feel the burn. Drills and Combos focuses on punching and kicks and putting them together. There's a couple repeating moves in both 20 minute workouts, which is the only tiny downside to this video. I would have liked to have seen completely different moves in each video instead of a couple repeats, although that's really not a big deal.I'd recommend this kickboxing workout.

Violet Zaki has starved herself, and shaped her hair into such a sharp mess, she resembles some sort of spiny ocean dwelling crustacean. The lovely ladies who accompany her are of a healthy size, but I think were chosen to accentuate Zaki's boniness. I'm surprised she didn't point behind her and say, ""Here's my chunk crew!"" The first segment is a random collection of weight training, cardio moves, and boxing in no particular order, for no particular length of time. It is utterly without choreography, but does get the heart going. Zaki speaks to the camera as if she were talking to a petulant child. ""You don't want to give up now, do you? Your body is telling you to stop, don't listen!"" Nope, don't feel like I have to stop, but thanks for the lack of encouragement.The second segment continues the wacky with a kind of kickboxing line dance that doesn't seem to repeat or build.

The DVD constists of:5 minute warm up includes side jabs, front punches, hooks & upper cuts, lunge stretch, squats, front kicks & rear kicks,  chambers & round house kicks.Power Sculpting (20 min.)You will need two sets of weights; 3-5 lbs for the heavy weights, 1-2 lbs for the light weights. Violet progressively builds on the movements. She alternates sculpting and cardio.  Violet begins with sculpting; arm scoops w/ weights & shoulder presses, then adds squats. Cardio Blast with jacks, jump rope, shuffle squats and forward/back shuffles. Next, leg sculpting - lunges, squats, & kicks with jacks. CB with upper cuts and football run.  Arm sculpting - tricept work, hooks & uppercuts. CB - Front kicks, calf pumps.... You get the idea =)  There are two remaining sculpting/cardio sets.  Violet finishes with 5 minutes of pure cardio.Drills & Combos (20 min.)No hand weights for this!  Violet start out using jabs, hooks, uppercuts and builds from there. Next she works on kicks; front, back, & roundhouse. She adds some jacks upping the intensity. The rest of the cardio is comprised of different combos incorporating all the kick boxing moves.6 minute Cool DownI really enjoyed this cool down.  It's better than most I've seen, which was refreshing!  Violet stretches out the legs while incorporating some balance too. I enjoy her breathing techniques, which may come from her Karate background? She does the usual stretching for arms.  The music is nice and relaxing =)Bonus Material includes a segment that explains proper form for the kickboxing moves, I highly recommend reviewing this. I learned my form for the hook was incorrect. There is also a 5 min. segment from her Weight Loss Cardio Scuplt DVD.If you do this workout in its entirety, you will be extremely sweaty!!!!

1243265,A12GJZ3T118DXA,B001V7YZBQ,"Scarlet O'Hara ""Southern Belle""","[4, 5]","I purchased this workout based off of the great reviews it received and also because I was familiar with Violet Zaki from her Crunch: Cardio Sculpt dvd, which has always been one of my favorites.  The way it started, I mistakenly thought that this was going to be a another pretty easy workout -- wow, was I wrong.  This was really really challenging!  By the end of the cardio segment, I was out of breath and really glad that it was over! (which is a good thing!)  I feel like a got an incredible cardio workout in the 51 minutes that it took to complete.  I am in great shape (I run, I bike and I swim) and many times, the workouts that I order are just too easy and I don't feel that I have gotten a good enough workout.  That is not the case with this video. Violet provides really great encouragement and instruction in a non-threatening way -- some instructors are just too over the top and really annoying.  She really makes you sweat but it's not overly fast-paced at all.  All of a sudden, you just realize your body is working really hard!  You will find yourself asking:  Hey, how did that happen?  This looked easy?!  You will want to do this workout again and again.  I would highly recommend purchasing.  I can't wait to do it again!  Also, another plus is the cooking light recipes that are included with the dvd -- that is really a nice extra.",5,"Tough, Fun and Very Effective",1275868800,"06 7, 2010",2010,1360,"['purchased', 'workout', 'based', 'great', 'received', 'also', 'was', 'familiar', 'Violet', 'Zaki', 'Crunch', 'Cardio', 'Sculpt', 'dvd', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorites', 'way', 'started', 'mistakenly', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'pretty', 'easy', 'workout', 'wow', 'was', 'wrong', 'was', 'really', 'really', 'challenging', 'end', 'cardio', 'segment', 'was', 'breath', 'really', 'glad', 'was', 'over', 'good', 'thing', 'feel', 'got', 'incredible', 'cardio', 'workout', '51', 'minutes', 'took', 'complete', 'am', 'great', 'shape', 'run', 'bike', 'swim', 'many', 'times', 'workouts', 'order', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'easy', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'have', 'gotten', 'good', 'enough', 'workout', 'not', 'case', 'video', 'Violet', 'really', 'great', 'encouragement', 'instruction', 'non-threatening', 'way', 'instructors', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'top', 'really', 'annoying', 'really', 'sweat', 'not', 'overly', 'fast-paced', 'sudden', 'just', 'realize', 'body', 'working', 'really', 'hard', 'will', 'find', 'asking', 'Hey', 'how', 'did', 'happen', 'looked', 'easy', 'will', 'want', 'do', 'workout', 'again', 'again', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'do', 'again', 'Also', 'cooking', 'light', 'recipes', 'are', 'included', 'dvd', 'really', 'nice', 'extra']",WEIGHT LOSS CARDIO KICK
