He played a character other than Jesus in this one. In fact, his character was a long way from that of Jesus, except for the long hair. Moore got a chance to show off the range of his acting skill with this one as he had the opportunity to get mad, sad, frustrated, and grief stricken. He passed all the litmus tests in my book. The story involved a lot of pathos. Most of the characters were void of Christian character, except for the little girl, played wonderfully by Christina Dawn Fougnie. Clancy was not so much a bad guy, but he wasn't a model citizen either. As the protagonist, his character arc was steeply upward. Despite the gloom all around her, the little girl with her big faith changed the world around her, instead of vice versa. Look out, Pollyanna, you have some competition.
