This is a snotty, phlegm filled flick that is only good if you enjoy watching sailors in uniform (hence Booger's keen interest). This is a very poor man's Last Detail in a way, without good acting, stars like Nicholson, or much of a plot. Obviously, if you tend to enjoy what Booger enjoys, go for it. I see that Booger (adam) has now deleted his review of this and other favorites of his, after a few sailors ""roughed him up"" a bit and forced ol Booger to ""swab the decks"" so to speak.

Thank you to God that the Navy was nothing like this at all.  There is no humor to this movie.  In fact, if memory serves, people were getting up and leaving the theater when I saw it.The four sailors are on liberty out to celebrate before leaving for their four individual schools.  Each of them are trying to meet a girl.  In the process, each story is forgettable.Once I graduated boot camp in San Diego, I was glad to find that it was nothing like this movie.",1,"Bad, really bad.

I don't know why any DVD manufacturer would want to waste the time, the plastic and the assembly line to release this.This came out during the wave of 80s exploitation films like Hardbodies, Summer Resort, Private School, Spring Break and countless other ""party"" films that rode on the heels of the great granddaddy Animal House. But what's really worse about this pile of celuloide diarrehea is that these other films were Lawrence of Arabia compared to it, at least they SOME funny moments and launched the careers of some future stars like Phoebe Cates, Tim Robbins and Matthew Modine (and had a few nice pair of knockers thrown in as well.)Don't waste your time, eyes, ears and money on this one!",1,An insult to the Navy,1291852800,"12 9, 2010",2010,848,"['piece', 'crap', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'Navy', 'stationed', 'well', '..San', 'Diego', 'found', 'be', 'purely', 'idiotic', 'insulting', 'Navy', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'DVD', 'manufacturer', 'would', 'want', 'waste', 'time', 'plastic', 'assembly', 'line', 'release', 'this.This', 'came', 'out', 'wave', '80s', 'exploitation', 'films', 'Hardbodies', 'Summer', 'Resort', 'Private', 'School', 'Spring', 'Break', 'countless', 'other', 'party', 'films', 'rode', 'heels', 'great', 'granddaddy', 'Animal', 'House', 'what', 'really', 'worse', 'pile', 'celuloide', 'diarrehea', 'other', 'films', 'were', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'compared', 'least', 'SOME', 'funny', 'moments', 'launched', 'careers', 'future', 'stars', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'had', 'few', 'nice', 'pair', 'knockers', 'thrown', 'as', 'well', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'eyes', 'ears', 'money', 'one']",Weekend Pass
1010090,A3JL195UPPU8IW,B000H5U69S,Joel Bowers,"[3, 3]",Another reviewer commented that this movie is purely idiotic & insulting to the Navy.I guess that's partly true-if we keep in mind the real plot of the movie. This never claims to be a story about daily life on a Navy base. And it's nowhere close to being a war flick either. It's a comedy about love. Four rookie sailors have just completed basic training in San Diego. Now it's off to Los Angeles for a 3 day weekend of partying & romance before they go their separate ways on Monday. Yes the comedy is a bit dry to be sure. But that doesn't keep Weekend Pass from being fun & entertaining anyway. If you watch closely you'll spot Theodore Wilson in a small supporting role. Wilson played Sweet Daddy on tv's Good Times. Here he plays Nat the owner of Nat's Solid Soul Food Shack. Phil Hartman also has a good part. He hadn't yet achieved stardom on Saturday Night Live. And Grand L.Rush who plays gang leader Bertram did 1 guest shot on Good Times during the 1976-1977 season. He plays Leon on the 2 part episode J.J.'S New Life. Picture & sound quality on this dvd are very good. Weekend Pass isn't the greatest movie I've ever seen. But it's still good for a few laughs nearly 30 years later.,4,This Weekend Pass Has Expired!,1307836800,"06 12, 2011",2011,1197,"['reviewer', 'commented', 'movie', 'purely', 'idiotic', 'insulting', 'Navy.I', 'guess', 'partly', 'true-if', 'keep', 'mind', 'real', 'plot', 'movie', 'never', 'be', 'story', 'daily', 'life', 'Navy', 'base', 'nowhere', 'close', 'being', 'war', 'flick', 'comedy', 'love', 'Four', 'rookie', 'sailors', 'have', 'just', 'completed', 'basic', 'training', 'San', 'Diego', 'Now', 'Los', 'Angeles', '3', 'day', 'weekend', 'partying', 'romance', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'Monday', 'Yes', 'comedy', 'bit', 'dry', 'be', 'sure', ""n't"", 'keep', 'Weekend', 'Pass', 'being', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'anyway', 'watch', 'closely', ""'ll"", 'spot', 'Theodore', 'Wilson', 'small', 'supporting', 'role', 'Wilson', 'played', 'Sweet', 'Daddy', 'tv', 'Good', 'Times', 'Here', 'Nat', 'owner', 'Nat', 'Solid', 'Soul', 'Food', 'Shack', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'also', 'good', 'part', 'had', ""n't"", 'yet', 'achieved', 'stardom', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Grand', 'L.Rush', 'who', 'gang', 'leader', 'Bertram', 'did', '1', 'guest', 'shot', 'Good', 'Times', '1976-1977', 'season', 'Leon', '2', 'part', 'episode', 'J.J.', 'New', 'Life', 'Picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'dvd', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Weekend', 'Pass', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'still', 'good', 'few', 'laughs', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'later']",Weekend Pass
