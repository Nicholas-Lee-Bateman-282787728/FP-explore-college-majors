She had been offered the posting before her husband was killed in a road accident but turned it down as he couldn't leave his medical patients.Her assistant at the embassy is arrogant, self confident Mike Slade who leads a campaign of resentment against her with the other embassy staff. This state of affairs ends when Mary asserts herself and proves to them that her appointment was no mistake. A group of dissidents from various countries try to block her plans for peace and even go so far as to try to assassinate Mary and her children. It's an old style Cold War thriller, headed by two very attractive actors, Jaclyn Smith and Robert Wagner and was excellent viewing on a cold, winter's night.",4,Iron curtain intrigue,1218412800,"08 11, 2008",2008,826,"['Widowed', 'political', 'scientist', 'Professor', 'Mary', 'Ashley', 'appointed', 'US', 'ambassador', 'Romania', 'travels', 'there', 'children', 'had', 'been', 'offered', 'posting', 'husband', 'was', 'killed', 'road', 'accident', 'turned', 'down', 'could', ""n't"", 'leave', 'medical', 'patients.Her', 'assistant', 'embassy', 'arrogant', 'self', 'confident', 'Mike', 'Slade', 'who', 'campaign', 'resentment', 'other', 'embassy', 'staff', 'state', 'affairs', 'ends', 'when', 'Mary', 'appointment', 'was', 'mistake', 'group', 'dissidents', 'various', 'countries', 'try', 'block', 'plans', 'peace', 'even', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'try', 'assassinate', 'Mary', 'children', 'old', 'style', 'Cold', 'War', 'thriller', 'headed', 'two', 'very', 'attractive', 'actors', 'Jaclyn', 'Smith', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'was', 'excellent', 'viewing', 'cold', 'winter', 'night']","Windmills of the Gods ( Sidney Sheldon's Windmills of the Gods ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.0 Import - Australia ]"

The plot follows the book very closely so there'll be no surprises for viewers who've read the book. And there's not much suspense but it did keep my interest and I wasn't bored by it.
