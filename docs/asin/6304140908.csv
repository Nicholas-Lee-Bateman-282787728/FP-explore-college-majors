403880,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6304140908,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[74, 77]","Though this television production doesn't have the epic grandeur of &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;, it is a marvelous telling of the story of Moses, with some superb acting; there are a few liberties taken to flesh out the script, but the heart of the Biblical account is intact, with a memorable portrayal by Ben Kingsley as the prophet who was &quot;clumsy with words&quot; but led his people to freedom.Other terrific performances come from David Suchet as Aaron, Sonia Braga as Zipporah, and Philip Stone as Jethro, and as the &quot;bad guys&quot;, Frank Langella, who with his sonorous voice makes an effective Pharaoh, and Maurice Roeves as Zerack, the man who is a continual kvetch.Filmed in sub-saharan Quarzazate and Agadir, Morocco, it is visually beautiful, with the excellent cinematography by Raffaele Mertes; I like the neutral palette, and the artifacts and costuming that give it an authentic look of ancient times. Added to the atmosphere is the wonderful score by Marco Frisina.The effects are good, from the parting of the sea to the tablets of the law, and other than a short sequence of violence (which includes a swift depiction of sacrificing an animal) after the golden calf incident, it is family friendly. Total running time is 184 minutes.This is a film that stands up to a lot of repeated viewing; it is so full of eternal truths, and content that is applicable to our lives today.",5,the journey to the promised land,1081987200,"04 15, 2004",2004,1411,"['television', 'production', ""n't"", 'have', 'epic', 'grandeur', 'quot', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'quot', 'marvelous', 'telling', 'story', 'Moses', 'superb', 'acting', 'are', 'few', 'liberties', 'taken', 'flesh', 'out', 'script', 'heart', 'Biblical', 'account', 'intact', 'memorable', 'portrayal', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'prophet', 'who', 'was', 'quot', 'clumsy', 'words', 'quot', 'led', 'people', 'freedom.Other', 'terrific', 'performances', 'come', 'David', 'Suchet', 'Aaron', 'Sonia', 'Braga', 'Zipporah', 'Philip', 'Stone', 'Jethro', 'quot', 'bad', 'guys', 'quot', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'who', 'sonorous', 'voice', 'effective', 'Pharaoh', 'Maurice', 'Roeves', 'Zerack', 'man', 'who', 'continual', 'kvetch.Filmed', 'sub-saharan', 'Quarzazate', 'Agadir', 'Morocco', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'Raffaele', 'Mertes', 'like', 'neutral', 'palette', 'artifacts', 'costuming', 'give', 'authentic', 'look', 'ancient', 'times', 'Added', 'atmosphere', 'wonderful', 'score', 'Marco', 'Frisina.The', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'parting', 'sea', 'tablets', 'law', 'other', 'short', 'sequence', 'violence', 'swift', 'depiction', 'sacrificing', 'animal', 'golden', 'calf', 'incident', 'family', 'friendly', 'Total', 'running', 'time', '184', 'minutes.This', 'film', 'up', 'lot', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'so', 'full', 'eternal', 'truths', 'content', 'applicable', 'lives', 'today']",Moses VHS

Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""","[10, 10]","If you like Bible DVD movies, then you should seriously consider buying this movie as part of THE BIBLE COLLECTION Box Set! You will get 6 DVD movies (ABRAHAM, JACOB, JOSEPH, MOSES, SAMSON & DELILAH, and DAVID) at about 50% less than buying them separately!MOSES shows scenes that I don't usually see in movies about Moses. This film rushes through the childhood of Moses before the opening credits are finished, but it makes up for it by doing a lot of Bible scenes that come after the 10 Commandments are given on Mount Sinai.You will see many Bible passages dramatized, including the Burning Bush, Manna & Quail from Heaven, Jethro's advice to delegate responsibility, the giving of the 10 Commandments, the Golden Calf, Miriam's leprosy, Korah's earthquake, Moses' sin of water from the rock, and the death of Moses, among many other Bible verses portrayed.The classic Charlton Heston 10 COMMANDMENTS movie had a highly productive, young Moses shown who is surprised to learn he's really a Hebrew, this version shows Moses to be a ridiculed, humble child, whose Hebrew roots are known, scorned, but tolerated by the Pharoah's household. They do more with the humbleness aspect of a stuttering Moses, which is Biblical.I was impressed that they showed the slaying of those responsible for the Golden Calf fiasco! Korah's earthquake was another surprise, but they condensed that scene a bit much.At the halfway point, 90 minutes into the 3 hours, they show the Red Sea parting, which leaves plenty of time to cover more of the 40 years of wandering than is usually shown in a Moses movie!Christopher Lee has a brief cameo appearance as the grandfather Pharoah of Moses and Ramses, but the main actor for Ramses does a great performance that really echoes Christopher Lee's attitude as the ruler of Egypt.The worst non-Biblical scene was having the Israelites all shout out the 10 Commandments at the foot of Mount Sinai (which never happened), before they were written in stone.MOSES is a great Bible movie and is more Scripturally accurate than the classic film THE TEN COMMANDMENTS (starring Charlton Heston).You should also consider the BIBLE SERIES BOX SET, which contains 3 DVD movies of equal quality as this one, (ESTHER, JEREMIAH, and SOLOMON).",5,Many Rare Scenes of Wilderness Wandering After the 10 Commandments,1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,2254,"['like', 'Bible', 'DVD', 'movies', 'then', 'should', 'seriously', 'consider', 'buying', 'movie', 'part', 'THE', 'BIBLE', 'COLLECTION', 'Box', 'Set', 'will', 'get', '6', 'DVD', 'movies', 'ABRAHAM', 'JACOB', 'JOSEPH', 'MOSES', 'SAMSON', 'DELILAH', 'DAVID', 'about', '50', '%', 'less', 'buying', 'separately', 'MOSES', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'see', 'movies', 'Moses', 'film', 'childhood', 'Moses', 'opening', 'credits', 'are', 'finished', 'up', 'doing', 'lot', 'Bible', 'scenes', 'come', '10', 'Commandments', 'are', 'given', 'Mount', 'Sinai.You', 'will', 'see', 'many', 'Bible', 'passages', 'dramatized', 'including', 'Burning', 'Bush', 'Manna', 'Quail', 'Heaven', 'Jethro', 'advice', 'delegate', 'responsibility', 'giving', '10', 'Commandments', 'Golden', 'Calf', 'Miriam', 'leprosy', 'Korah', 'earthquake', 'Moses', 'sin', 'water', 'rock', 'death', 'Moses', 'many', 'other', 'Bible', 'verses', 'portrayed.The', 'classic', 'Charlton', 'Heston', '10', 'COMMANDMENTS', 'movie', 'had', 'highly', 'productive', 'young', 'Moses', 'shown', 'who', 'surprised', 'learn', 'really', 'Hebrew', 'version', 'Moses', 'be', 'ridiculed', 'humble', 'child', 'Hebrew', 'roots', 'are', 'known', 'scorned', 'tolerated', 'Pharoah', 'household', 'do', 'more', 'humbleness', 'aspect', 'stuttering', 'Moses', 'Biblical.I', 'was', 'impressed', 'showed', 'slaying', 'responsible', 'Golden', 'Calf', 'fiasco', 'Korah', 'earthquake', 'was', 'surprise', 'condensed', 'scene', 'bit', 'halfway', 'point', '90', 'minutes', '3', 'hours', 'show', 'Red', 'Sea', 'parting', 'plenty', 'time', 'cover', 'more', '40', 'years', 'wandering', 'usually', 'shown', 'Moses', 'movie', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'brief', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'grandfather', 'Pharoah', 'Moses', 'Ramses', 'main', 'actor', 'Ramses', 'great', 'performance', 'really', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'attitude', 'ruler', 'Egypt.The', 'worst', 'non-Biblical', 'scene', 'was', 'having', 'Israelites', 'shout', '10', 'Commandments', 'foot', 'Mount', 'Sinai', 'never', 'happened', 'were', 'written', 'stone.MOSES', 'great', 'Bible', 'movie', 'more', 'Scripturally', 'accurate', 'classic', 'film', 'THE', 'TEN', 'COMMANDMENTS', 'starring', 'Charlton', 'Heston', '.You', 'should', 'also', 'consider', 'BIBLE', 'SERIES', 'BOX', 'SET', '3', 'DVD', 'movies', 'equal', 'quality', 'one', 'ESTHER', 'JEREMIAH', 'SOLOMON']",Moses VHS

403887,A1TKYAYESYHIA2,6304140908,"Elijah Chingosho ""Dr Elijah Chingosho""","[4, 4]","Moses is among the best film that I have seen from the Bible collection. Among the others I have seen are Joseph, David, Abraham, Jacob and Samson and Delilah. Ben Kingsley plays Moses, a feat he performs with remarkable success. He plays the ordinary man who answers God's call to carry out enormous responsibilities. Watching this film is a spiritual journey illustrating God's love for his people. Best of all, the story in the film is very close to that in the Bible (unlike the more spectacular ""Ten Commandments"" by Cecil DeMille).This is a compelling movie that illustrates vividly the challenges that Moses and a nation of people who followed him to the Promised Land had to endure. Moses, who stutters and occasionally blunders, initially feels inadequate and unequal to the enormity of his task and needed assistance from his brother Aaron. However, as the film develops, Moses grows not only in faith but also to be a confident leader who speaks with absolute authority as the Voice of God.The production is excellent. The stage settings, costumes and portrayal of the realities of day-to-day living in those times are very impressive. The Biblical story of Exodus comes to life as one gets some appreciation of the challenges that Moses had  leading the mass of people under constant threat of attack, hunger and without a home and who had doubts about the authenticity of the relationship between Moses and God.There are many unforgettable moments in the movie such as the parting of the Red Sea and when Moses reaches the gates of the Promised Land, but cannot get there. However, the righteous and God fearing Moses accepts God's will.My only minor criticism is that although it is estimated that up to two and half-million Israelites left Egypt during the time of the Exodus, one sees the largest group of people in the film numbering just over 70, due to budget constraints. However, this does little to dilute this great movie which is well worth watching.",5,Captivating Movie,1143072000,"03 23, 2006",2006,1974,"['Moses', 'best', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'Bible', 'collection', 'others', 'have', 'seen', 'are', 'Joseph', 'David', 'Abraham', 'Jacob', 'Samson', 'Delilah', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Moses', 'feat', 'remarkable', 'success', 'ordinary', 'man', 'who', 'God', 'call', 'carry', 'out', 'enormous', 'responsibilities', 'Watching', 'film', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'illustrating', 'God', 'love', 'people', 'Best', 'story', 'film', 'very', 'close', 'Bible', 'more', 'spectacular', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'Cecil', 'DeMille', '.This', 'compelling', 'movie', 'vividly', 'challenges', 'Moses', 'nation', 'people', 'who', 'followed', 'Promised', 'Land', 'had', 'endure', 'Moses', 'who', 'stutters', 'occasionally', 'blunders', 'initially', 'feels', 'inadequate', 'unequal', 'enormity', 'task', 'needed', 'assistance', 'brother', 'Aaron', 'However', 'film', 'Moses', 'not', 'only', 'faith', 'also', 'be', 'confident', 'leader', 'who', 'absolute', 'authority', 'Voice', 'God.The', 'production', 'excellent', 'stage', 'settings', 'costumes', 'portrayal', 'realities', 'day-to-day', 'living', 'times', 'are', 'very', 'impressive', 'Biblical', 'story', 'Exodus', 'life', 'one', 'appreciation', 'challenges', 'Moses', 'had', 'leading', 'mass', 'people', 'constant', 'threat', 'attack', 'hunger', 'home', 'who', 'had', 'doubts', 'authenticity', 'relationship', 'Moses', 'God.There', 'are', 'many', 'unforgettable', 'moments', 'movie', 'such', 'parting', 'Red', 'Sea', 'when', 'Moses', 'gates', 'Promised', 'Land', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'there', 'However', 'righteous', 'God', 'fearing', 'Moses', 'God', 'will.My', 'only', 'minor', 'criticism', 'estimated', 'two', 'half-million', 'Israelites', 'left', 'Egypt', 'time', 'Exodus', 'one', 'largest', 'group', 'people', 'film', 'numbering', 'just', '70', 'due', 'budget', 'constraints', 'However', 'little', 'dilute', 'great', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",Moses VHS
403888,A1BYDMYY2EDVRF,6304140908,Franklin Howell,"[21, 23]","Devoid of the excessive stereotyping and Americanization prominent in The Ten Commandments, Young's work is a long-awaited breath of fresh air.  In this version, Kingsley portrays a Moses much more warm and human, complete  with occasional stuttering and blunders.  The viewer will find in this  character a mortal man facing genuinely impossible obligations.  His  humanness is demonstrated, for instance, during the great slaughter of the  masses following the golden calf event.  Standing bold and firm with his  staff in hand, Moses oversees the brutal, gratuitous killings while  shedding tears in the process.The beauty of the miracle events in this  movie is in the raw atmosphere accompanying each moment.  These miracles  portray realism rather than magical wonders in a fairy tale, candy coated  with church liturgy.  For example, the burning bush scene in The Ten  Commandments involves a state of piety not unlike that of a modern day  church in Western society.  The setting bears soft lights and prominent  silence.  In essence, Moses enters a holy altar.  Bowing to God, his  movements are rehearsed and orderly, like a skilled monk in a prayer  closet.  Quietly and humbly, Moses moves into repentance and consecration.  When God tells him what he wants him to do, Moses' question of &quot;Who am  I to do such a thing&quot; carries a tone of modesty instead of rejection.  But in Young's rendering of this event matters are very different.  Moses  is caught off guard in an otherwise normal setting of sheep, rocks, and  dust when a common shrub a few meters from him suddenly bursts into flames.  Upon investigation, Moses finds himself not so much at an altar but rather  in an altered state.  Yet the rawness of nature surrounding this phenomenon  remains unchanged.  When confronted with his assignment, Moses pleads with  God consistently to reconsider.  He cries out and insists that he is the  wrong man for the job.  Equally impressive is the scene's conclusion.  With  a promise of assurance God gets the last word in, and just like that the  bush returns to normal and the altered state is gone.  No music, no space  gun sound effects, no singing angels.  Moses, still in shock, checks his  surroundings and then himself as if questioning his own sanity.The  film presents a cast of good actors.  The character dispositions are  slightly peculiar and odd in a way that seems to jibe with the nature of  ancient Middle Eastern culture.  This serves to alienate the audience just  enough to generate a convincing level of authenticity throughout the saga.  Though made on a budget, the movie avoids those tell-tale budget features  that get in the way of enjoying the moments.  I found it both colorful and  poignant, and consider it suitable for anyone, believer and atheist alike.",4,Stimulating and Stirring,947376000,"01 9, 2000",2000,2807,"['Devoid', 'excessive', 'stereotyping', 'Americanization', 'prominent', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'Young', 'work', 'long-awaited', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'version', 'Kingsley', 'Moses', 'much', 'more', 'warm', 'human', 'complete', 'occasional', 'stuttering', 'blunders', 'viewer', 'will', 'find', 'character', 'mortal', 'man', 'facing', 'genuinely', 'impossible', 'obligations', 'humanness', 'demonstrated', 'instance', 'great', 'slaughter', 'masses', 'following', 'golden', 'calf', 'event', 'Standing', 'bold', 'firm', 'staff', 'hand', 'Moses', 'brutal', 'gratuitous', 'killings', 'shedding', 'tears', 'process.The', 'beauty', 'miracle', 'events', 'movie', 'raw', 'atmosphere', 'accompanying', 'moment', 'miracles', 'portray', 'realism', 'rather', 'magical', 'wonders', 'fairy', 'tale', 'candy', 'coated', 'church', 'liturgy', 'example', 'burning', 'bush', 'scene', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'state', 'piety', 'not', 'modern', 'day', 'church', 'Western', 'society', 'setting', 'bears', 'soft', 'lights', 'prominent', 'silence', 'essence', 'Moses', 'holy', 'altar', 'Bowing', 'God', 'movements', 'are', 'rehearsed', 'orderly', 'skilled', 'monk', 'prayer', 'closet', 'Quietly', 'humbly', 'Moses', 'repentance', 'consecration', 'When', 'God', 'what', 'do', 'Moses', 'question', 'quot', 'Who', 'am', 'do', 'thing', 'quot', 'tone', 'modesty', 'instead', 'rejection', 'Young', 'rendering', 'event', 'matters', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'Moses', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'otherwise', 'normal', 'setting', 'sheep', 'rocks', 'dust', 'when', 'common', 'shrub', 'few', 'meters', 'suddenly', 'flames', 'investigation', 'Moses', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'altar', 'rather', 'altered', 'state', 'rawness', 'nature', 'surrounding', 'phenomenon', 'unchanged', 'When', 'confronted', 'assignment', 'Moses', 'God', 'consistently', 'reconsider', 'out', 'wrong', 'man', 'job', 'Equally', 'impressive', 'scene', 'conclusion', 'promise', 'assurance', 'God', 'last', 'word', 'just', 'bush', 'normal', 'altered', 'state', 'gone', 'music', 'space', 'gun', 'sound', 'effects', 'singing', 'angels', 'Moses', 'still', 'shock', 'surroundings', 'then', 'questioning', 'own', 'sanity.The', 'film', 'cast', 'good', 'actors', 'character', 'dispositions', 'are', 'slightly', 'peculiar', 'odd', 'way', 'jibe', 'nature', 'ancient', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'culture', 'alienate', 'audience', 'just', 'enough', 'generate', 'convincing', 'level', 'authenticity', 'saga', 'made', 'budget', 'movie', 'avoids', 'tell-tale', 'budget', 'features', 'get', 'way', 'enjoying', 'moments', 'found', 'colorful', 'poignant', 'consider', 'suitable', 'anyone', 'believer', 'atheist', 'alike']",Moses VHS

403893,A20CR4907G7CTS,6304140908,Jeff Marzano,"[6, 7]",Watching movies like this is a good way to review the bible stories and also get a slightly different understanding of what happened.An example of this is when Moses strikes the rock twice to get water without checking with God first.  That event is presented as being a result of the frustration that undoubtedly occurred during their 40 years of wanderings in the desert.The movie also gives the feeling that there were some key events where some people had to be weeded out of the group because they were going to cause problems.  This happened when Moses came back with the 10 commandments the first time and with the rebellion of the Koras.  In both case bloodshed occurred.Moses was no choir boy anyway since he left Egypt after killing that one Egyptian.  I suscribe to the Edgar Cayce information about the motivation for this killing.  That Egyptian had sexually assaulted Moses' sister.I would have liked to see the part when Moses first saw the beautiful 'Ethiopian' woman come along.  If I recall correctly from the bible his attraction to this woman created some controversy.There's still a lot of mysteries surrounding these events and this story could be done again with tremendous special effects.The hard part is knowing more precisely what exactly happened.Jeff MarzanoLives of the Master: The Rest of the Jesus StoryEdgar Cayce's Story of the Old Testament From the Birth of Souls to the Death of MosesThe Lives of Edgar CayceEdgar Cayce's Egypt: Psychic Revelations on the Most Fascinating Civilization Ever KnownInitiation in the Great Pyramid (Astara's Library of Mystical Classics),4,Good Review Of Bible Stories,1094774400,"09 10, 2004",2004,1604,"['Watching', 'movies', 'good', 'way', 'review', 'bible', 'stories', 'also', 'get', 'slightly', 'different', 'understanding', 'what', 'happened.An', 'example', 'when', 'Moses', 'rock', 'twice', 'get', 'water', 'checking', 'God', 'first', 'event', 'presented', 'being', 'result', 'frustration', 'undoubtedly', 'occurred', '40', 'years', 'wanderings', 'desert.The', 'movie', 'also', 'feeling', 'were', 'key', 'events', 'where', 'people', 'had', 'be', 'weeded', 'group', 'were', 'going', 'cause', 'problems', 'happened', 'when', 'Moses', 'came', 'back', '10', 'commandments', 'first', 'time', 'rebellion', 'Koras', 'case', 'bloodshed', 'occurred.Moses', 'was', 'choir', 'anyway', 'left', 'Egypt', 'killing', 'one', 'Egyptian', 'suscribe', 'Edgar', 'Cayce', 'information', 'motivation', 'killing', 'Egyptian', 'had', 'sexually', 'assaulted', 'Moses', 'sister.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'part', 'when', 'Moses', 'first', 'saw', 'beautiful', ""'Ethiopian"", 'woman', 'come', 'along', 'recall', 'correctly', 'bible', 'attraction', 'woman', 'created', 'controversy.There', 'still', 'lot', 'mysteries', 'surrounding', 'events', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'again', 'tremendous', 'special', 'effects.The', 'hard', 'part', 'knowing', 'more', 'precisely', 'what', 'exactly', 'happened.Jeff', 'MarzanoLives', 'Master', 'Rest', 'Jesus', 'StoryEdgar', 'Cayce', 'Story', 'Old', 'Testament', 'Birth', 'Souls', 'Death', 'MosesThe', 'Lives', 'Edgar', 'CayceEdgar', 'Cayce', 'Egypt', 'Psychic', 'Revelations', 'Most', 'Fascinating', 'Civilization', 'Ever', 'KnownInitiation', 'Great', 'Pyramid', 'Astara', 'Library', 'Mystical', 'Classics']",Moses VHS

403895,A3EAI032S3EBBK,6304140908,"Jerry Parks ""USAToday All-American Teacher; N...","[45, 48]","Ben Kingsley has to be one of the finest Hollywood--as well as biblical, character actors in the world today. His Moses spans the life of the hero from youth to the old man most people think of when the name of Moses is mentioned.This film is the best version of the Exodus story to date. It is far superior to 'Ten Commandments', which stressed the spectacular at the expense of the accurate. This TNT version--while not quite as good as 'Joseph', is extremely accurate in its depiction of ancient Egyptian history. It stresses the Egyptian background of Moses' life, and doesn't just portray him as simply Hebrew alone.How nice to see Moses pictured as a highly trained soldier (which he surely was) in growing up in the Pharaoh's court! Especially novel is the portrayal of Moses' lisp, which could be a very accurate interpretation of the Biblical narrative's 'slow of speech'. While a bit more emphasis could've been placed on the fact that the plagues were specific judgments upon Egyptian gods, the film does a fine job in nearly every other respect.The next to last meeting between Moses and the Pharaoh (&quot;MY name resounds in all the earth--and I let YOU live&quot;!) is exceptionally well written, and the final meeting is wonderful. Moses speaks volumes in his silence! The parting of the Red Sea is pretty darn good (though the crossing is mysteriously speedy--even for an epic!), and the fact that the Hebrews crossed it 'on dry ground' is an excellent addition which most miss in the Bible, not to mention the film! Great job, here!The 'pillars of fire' which hold back the Egyptians are depicted as lightning, and this part is a real highlight! The film assumes Ramases and Mernepta are the major Pharaohs of the period. This might cause a little confusion to more conservative believers who place the Exodus earlier (1445 BC), and the Pharaoh as Thutmoses III. It will be especially confusing to 'Prince of Egypt' admirers, since Ramases there is Moses' friend, instead of the Pharaoh-father.All in all, this is a film well worth watching. Unlike 'Joseph' however, which never had a dull moment, 'Moses' is considerably less interesting after the crossing of the Red Sea. But it does fair justice to the Bible, and the acting is superb.

The sets are not as big or as expensive but everything is well done.The story is the seminal event for the story of the Jewish people and nation. The people are held as slaves in Egypt. Moses is raised as a privileged prince of the royal house but is conflicted. He kills an Egyptian while saving a Jewish slave and flees for his life. He finds safety but God orders him to go back and free the people.

However, in some places it did not follow scripture very well. First it showed Moses as a child when he was not heard of from the time he was put on the Nile until he was about 30. Secondly it showed him leaving his wife and children behind when he returned to Egypt. The Bible clearly states he took his wife and 2 sons. Moses sent them back to Jethro, her father when on the trip to Egypt. When Jethro came to visit Moses the dialog about his missing Zapphora was not accurate. Jethro brought her and her 2 sons back to Moses and returned to his land without them. There was a lost also to learn about Moses and the Exodus that is only theatrically portrayed or not portrayed in the Ten Commandments. One account was when the people wanted to hear God too. The movie showed God speaking the 10 commandments through the people before God gave them to Moses on Mt. Sinai. It showed how the people were afraid to listen to God and learned to trust more in the leading of their God through Moses. There is a lot to learn from the movie if you read the account of Moses. There is also other things that had to be changed to fit the script . It was worth watching and I highly recommend it if you are wanting a Biblical account of Moses.

I throroughly enjoy The Prince of Egypt but its drawback is that is departs from the biblical narrative in several major ways, and live action films are more credible for classroom use than cartoons. The Ten Commandments looks great but has too much melodrama and a distracting and unnecessary love triangle. This film looks just as good as The Ten Commandments, but the writing and direction are not nearly as good as the sets and costumes and effects. It fails to deliver the natural drama of the story by a very pedestrian approach in many instances, and in others is too melodramatic and overwrought, with too many people yelling and wailing, including Moses. I like that he laughs but too often he seems just loony, laughing oddly one moment and then roaring the next. The people of Israel never number more than maybe 100 persons in any scene.

403913,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,6304140908,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[2, 3]","This TNT miniseries is arguably the best film portrayal of Moses for biblical accuracy and entertainment value. Ben Kingsley is a bit old for the role at 52, but he plays Moses with a passionate zeal and human fallibility (anger, stuttering, impatience) that is captivating to behold, if not readily sympathetic for younger viewers who may want more action than character development. If too many Bible films offer one-dimensional heroes and villains rather than Biblical figures with real character arcs, Kingsley is the antidote as a reluctant hero who matures from a misfit plagued by self-doubts into a true leader of men who trusts deeply in God despite his lingering flaws.The other actors are good foils for Kingsley, giving their own nuanced interpretations of the material. Frank Langella and (more briefly) Christopher Lee nail their roles as the two pharaohs of the story, showing stubborn anger and lust for power without descending into cartoon villainy. David Suchet of PBS ""Mystery"" fame offers a richly textured Aaron and Scottish actor Maurice Roeves (""The Last of the Mohicans"") makes a convincing Hebrew foreman who represents all of Israel's doubts and rebellious instincts, even though he's probably the weakest character of the film. Philip Stone, a staple in Stanley Kubrick films, makes a warm and likable Jethro whose character somehow benefits in a grandfatherly way from being just a tad bland.The film has a few minor downsides. It moves slowly in spots and might have benefitted from including more of the action-packed material (attack of the Amalekites anyone?) from Exodus in its second half, rather than several slow-moving character segments in the desert that are apparently meant to explicate the biblical story. The Amalekite battle featuring the staff of Moses would have been welcome here, emphasizing an important element (the ability to defend themselves) in Israel's journey from slavery to nationhood that is otherwise neglected here. Also, the early CGI special effects are muted despite being very good, making them likely to disappoint younger viewers who expects high spectacle -- i.e. a magical special effects atmosphere for the plagues and crossing of the Red Sea -- from any version of this story on film. Finally, the broad outlines of this story are so familiar that the viewer may lose interest in its straightforwardly reverent approach, which eschews Hollywood style to the point of casting plain-looking people dressed in authentic garb rather than supermodels dressed to attract the eye. For all of these reasons, the film might disappoint kids who have been weened on the self-assured Moses of DeMille's ""Ten Commandments"" spectacle and the animated wizardry of Dreamworks' ""Prince of Egypt"" film. It may also disappoint those who want to see an edgier agnostic take on this material, such as Hallmark's dreadful 2006 miniseries ""The Ten Commandments"" and its guilt-ridden Moses (Dougray Scott) who is a one-dimensional nutjob. One may reasonably expect that Ridley Scott's ""Exodus,"" starring the wooden Christian Bale as Moses, will likewise be a disappointment when it hits theaters in December 2014.Yet the film is sensitive in its emotions, subtle in its themes, and brilliant in its characterizations. Its naturalistic and historical style presents real events with real people struggling and often failing to grow in faith with God's help. The overall narrative is coherent and reasonably close to the Bible, dispensing with the birth and childhood of Moses (which took most of the first half of DeMille's 1956 film!) before the opening credits have finished rolling. Marco Frisina's score and Raffaele Mertes' photography are beautiful. Ultimately, however, the film belongs to Kingsley: He's clearly going for broke in an effort to sell his emotions in every scene, and the effort is mostly successful. Rather than declaiming biblical words in high-handed style, Kingsley uses the speech rhythms of powerful orators like Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela (as he relates in interviews) to create an intimate portrait of Israel's first prophet and lawgiver. Despite its fidelity to the source material and its other merits, this photoplay rises or falls on Sir Ben Kingsley's shoulders, and he manages to elevate the film from a dry religious lesson into a performance of deep insight into the thoughts and emotions of the man ""who talked to God face to face."" His performance in the burning bush and theophany (Ten Commandments) scenes are particularly memorable, emphasizing the film's gift at presenting the supernatural in a naturalistic way. And the confrontations between Kingsley and Langella as the Pharaoh are electric. If you see this movie, you will feel like you know Moses better than in any other film portrayal, and that is perhaps its greatest achievement.",5,Intimate human portrait of Moses,1381449600,"10 11,
