To me, the classic example of an Asian-West fusion is the late David Carradine'sKung Fu: The Complete Series Collection.  Sometimes the fusion works great, other times not as well.The beginning was a bit weak, but the transition to the West is where things really picked up.  The director's view of The West is interesting but very gritty.  It's a harsh world where everyone cooperates in order to survive.  The runaway assassin is eventually accepted by the town, and works as a laundry man.  However, belonging to a community brings obligations, and these obligations collide with his past when outlaws return to town.A lot has been said here already about the fighting/action sequences.  I throw my hat with the thumbs up camp.  To me, the most interesting part of the film is seeing Kate Bosworth being taught to fight with a blade in each hand.  This reminds me of the scene where Catherine Zeta Jones is taught to fence by Antonio Banderas in the late 90sThe Mask of Zorro (Deluxe Edition).",4,Artistic Fusion of Asia and The West,1309737600,"07 4, 2011",2011,1185,"['did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'expectations', 'popping', 'disc', 'dvd', 'drive', 'labtop', 'find', 'doing', 'bit', 'fist', 'pumping', 'various', 'action', 'sequences', 'Warrior', 'Way', 'classic', 'example', 'Asian-West', 'fusion', 'late', 'David', ""Carradine'sKung"", 'Fu', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Collection', 'Sometimes', 'fusion', 'great', 'other', 'times', 'not', 'well.The', 'beginning', 'was', 'bit', 'weak', 'transition', 'West', 'where', 'things', 'really', 'picked', 'up', 'director', 'view', 'West', 'interesting', 'very', 'gritty', 'harsh', 'world', 'where', 'everyone', 'order', 'survive', 'runaway', 'assassin', 'eventually', 'accepted', 'town', 'laundry', 'man', 'However', 'belonging', 'community', 'obligations', 'obligations', 'collide', 'past', 'when', 'outlaws', 'return', 'town.A', 'lot', 'been', 'said', 'here', 'already', 'fighting/action', 'sequences', 'throw', 'hat', 'thumbs', 'up', 'camp', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'film', 'seeing', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'being', 'taught', 'fight', 'blade', 'hand', 'scene', 'where', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'taught', 'fence', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'late', '90sThe', 'Mask', 'Zorro', 'Deluxe', 'Edition']",N/A
1432001,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B004XFZ3UU,blackaciddevil,"[0, 0]","Despite it's strange premise, The Warrior's Way was a pretty good spaghetti western action flick. It tells the story of Yang (Jang Dong-gun), ""the greatest swordsman in the history of mankind,"" who's managed to wipe out all his enemies except for one, that being an infant whom he refuses to murder, much to the displeasure of his boss, the leader of a band known as the Sad Flutes. Knowing this, Yang ends up on the run and, somehow, ends up in a worn-down town running the town laundry service. There, he meets a young woman with a past of her own..her family was slaughtered by a local bad guy known as the Colonel. He soon befriends her as well as the rest of the town until the past catches up to him.After seeing the trailer for this movie, I figured that it would be a straight martial arts flick set in the old west but it ended up being something I wasn't quite expecting. That being said, it did end up pretty good.Heck, it even left the movie open for a part two. Yet, somehow, I feel like we won't see one(as it has recieved poor reviews). Course, I could be wrong.

1432004,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B004XFZ3UU,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 6]","""The Warrior's Way"" combines the brutal violence of a martial arts saga, the nostalgic lure of an old west drama, and the visual appeal of a living comic book. And yet, in trying to be all those things, it ends up being none of them; what was supposed to be an edgy East-meets-West fusion is in fact an unexplainable, unpleasant mishmash of genres that really don't belong together. It's an oddity, an otherworldly import that never aims to be funny but somehow can get you laughing at the drop of a hat. It's above all a deep mystery, not only begging the question of how it was conceived, but also of who actually believed it would work. I don't pretend to be the end all when it comes to martial arts films or even to westerns, but I think I've seen enough of each to know that combining them isn't a good idea.It might have helped had first-time writer/director Sngmoo Lee known which story he wanted to tell. There are essentially two plotlines running through the film, and neither has a firm grasp on itself. The central character is Yang (Jang Dong-gun), a warrior from an Asian land of an unspecific location and era. He was raised to be a ruthless, cunning assassin - a man with lightning-quick reflexes and an inhuman ability to stay focused. His sole mission was to murder every single member of a warring clan. When he finds he's unable to murder the last of his enemies - a baby girl - he takes her and flees, for he knows that disobeying his clan is an automatic death sentence. His destination: America, where he hopes to reunite with an old friend, who made a name for himself as a launderer in the desert community of Lode, which bills itself as the Paris of the West.Yang's friend has long since died. Lode is a lifeless, withering hulk of a one-horse town that bears absolutely no resemblance to Paris. Stranded there is a travelling circus; it has begun erecting a gigantic Ferris wheel, one that looms overhead and looks like a rusting skeleton. The proprietor is a miniature showman named 8-Ball (Tony Cox). His troupe is a reliable motley crew of freakish stereotypes, the most prominent being a bearded lady. The rest of the residents are the most buffoonish western caricatures of any recent film I've seen. There's Ron, the town drunk (Geoffrey Rush), who also happens to be an expert marksman. There's also Lynne (Kate Bosworth), a knife-thrower who knew Yang's friend and had even learned a thing or two from him.And this is where the second plotline comes into play. As a girl, Lynne miraculously survived an attack by a group of men led by The Colonel (Danny Houston), whose heartless exploits go no further than raping and murdering women with good teeth. His encounter left his physically scarred, and now he has returned to Lode wearing a mask that makes him look like a cowboy retrofit of the Phantom of the Opera. Lynne wants her revenge. The Colonel wants to make trouble. Inevitably, this will culminate in a climactic battle, one that pits dozens of heavily armed men against a coffin full of guns, a Ferris wheel rigged with dynamite, and a sword-toting Asian assassin.Think this is the end of the movie? Not so fast. As Yang and the residents of Lode battle The Colonel and his posse, a legion of ninjas descend on the town and wreak their own special havoc. It seems that Yang's past has caught up with him, although I'll be damned if I knew how they managed to find him - and I mean besides their ability to listen to the ""weeping"" of his sword. But that isn't quite the point I'm trying to make. All I want to know is, which of these battles is the more important one of the story? Who are we supposed to root for? If it's Yang, then why is that, after claiming the baby as his own, she's treated as nothing other than an object for audiences to laugh at and find cute? If it's Lynne, then why is her story wrapped up before we have the chance to invest in it? This is what I mean about not knowing which story is being told. The film has two plots fighting for the same screen time.There are other problems. Ron serves as the film's narrator, and while he says all the expected things, he's hardly a reliable character given how much time he spends drinking. There's also a painfully contrived romance between Yang and Lynne that isn't anything close to believable, probably because Don-gun and Bosworth have absolutely no chemistry together. How can they when Yang is depicted as the proverbial lonesome warrior, loved by no one and unable to give love in return? There's a moment in which Ron tells us that, during his time in Lode, Yang learned to love the simple life, especially in regard to growing and tending flowers; we would not have known this without a voiceover narration, for Yang rarely speaks and his face reveals no emotion at all. The only thing I got from ""The Warrior's Way"" was the knowledge that I shouldn't believe anything a drunk says.",3,The Wrong Combination of East-Meets-West,1291334400,"12 3, 2010",2010,4905,"['Warrior', 'Way', 'brutal', 'violence', 'martial', 'arts', 'saga', 'nostalgic', 'lure', 'old', 'west', 'drama', 'visual', 'appeal', 'living', 'comic', 'book', 'yet', 'trying', 'be', 'things', 'up', 'being', 'none', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'edgy', 'East-meets-West', 'fusion', 'fact', 'unexplainable', 'unpleasant', 'mishmash', 'genres', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'belong', 'together', 'oddity', 'otherworldly', 'import', 'never', 'be', 'funny', 'somehow', 'can', 'get', 'laughing', 'drop', 'hat', 'deep', 'mystery', 'not', 'only', 'begging', 'question', 'how', 'was', 'conceived', 'also', 'who', 'actually', 'believed', 'would', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'end', 'when', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'even', 'westerns', 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enough', 'know', 'combining', ""n't"", 'good', 'idea.It', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'had', 'first-time', 'writer/director', 'Sngmoo', 'Lee', 'known', 'story', 'wanted', 'tell', 'are', 'essentially', 'two', 'plotlines', 'running', 'film', 'firm', 'grasp', 'central', 'character', 'Yang', 'Jang', 'Dong-gun', 'warrior', 'Asian', 'land', 'unspecific', 'location', 'era', 'was', 'raised', 'be', 'ruthless', 'cunning', 'assassin', 'man', 'lightning-quick', 'reflexes', 'inhuman', 'ability', 'stay', 'focused', 'sole', 'mission', 'was', 'murder', 'single', 'member', 'warring', 'clan', 'When', 'unable', 'murder', 'last', 'enemies', 'baby', 'girl', 'flees', 'disobeying', 'clan', 'automatic', 'death', 'sentence', 'destination', 'America', 'where', 'reunite', 'old', 'friend', 'who', 'made', 'name', 'launderer', 'desert', 'community', 'Lode', 'bills', 'Paris', 'West.Yang', 'friend', 'long', 'died', 'Lode', 'lifeless', 'withering', 'hulk', 'one-horse', 'town', 'absolutely', 'resemblance', 'Paris', 'Stranded', 'travelling', 'circus', 'begun', 'erecting', 'gigantic', 'Ferris', 'wheel', 'one', 'overhead', 'rusting', 'skeleton', 'proprietor', 'miniature', 'showman', 'named', '8-Ball', 'Tony', 'Cox', 'troupe', 'reliable', 'motley', 'crew', 'freakish', 'stereotypes', 'most', 'prominent', 'being', 'bearded', 'lady', 'rest', 'residents', 'are', 'most', 'buffoonish', 'western', 'caricatures', 'recent', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Ron', 'town', 'drunk', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'expert', 'marksman', 'also', 'Lynne', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'knife-thrower', 'who', 'knew', 'Yang', 'friend', 'had', 'even', 'learned', 'thing', 'two', 'him.And', 'where', 'second', 'plotline', 'play', 'girl', 'Lynne', 'miraculously', 'survived', 'attack', 'group', 'men', 'led', 'Colonel', 'Danny', 'Houston', 'heartless', 'exploits', 'go', 'further', 'raping', 'murdering', 'women', 'good', 'teeth', 'encounter', 'left', 'physically', 'scarred', 'now', 'returned', 'Lode', 'wearing', 'mask', 'look', 'cowboy', 'retrofit', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Lynne', 'revenge', 'Colonel', 'make', 'trouble', 'Inevitably', 'will', 'culminate', 'climactic', 'battle', 'one', 'dozens', 'heavily', 'armed', 'men', 'coffin', 'full', 'guns', 'Ferris', 'wheel', 'rigged', 'dynamite', 'sword-toting', 'Asian', 'assassin.Think', 'end', 'movie', 'Not', 'fast', 'Yang', 'residents', 'Lode', 'battle', 'Colonel', 'posse', 'legion', 'ninjas', 'descend', 'town', 'wreak', 'own', 'special', 'havoc', 'Yang', 'past', 'caught', 'up', ""'ll"", 'be', 'damned', 'knew', 'how', 'managed', 'find', 'mean', 'ability', 'listen', 'weeping', 'sword', ""n't"", 'quite', 'point', ""'m"", 'trying', 'make', 'want', 'know', 'battles', 'more', 'important', 'one', 'story', 'Who', 'are', 'supposed', 'root', 'Yang', 'then', 'why', 'claiming', 'baby', 'own', 'treated', 'nothing', 'other', 'object', 'audiences', 'laugh', 'find', 'cute', 'Lynne', 'then', 'why', 'story', 'wrapped', 'up', 'have', 'chance', 'invest', 'what', 'mean', 'not', 'knowing', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'film', 'two', 'plots', 'fighting', 'same', 'screen', 'are', 'other', 'problems', 'Ron', 'film', 'narrator', 'expected', 'things', 'hardly', 'reliable', 'character', 'given', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'drinking', 'also', 'painfully', 'contrived', 'romance', 'Yang', 'Lynne', ""n't"", 'anything', 'close', 'believable', 'probably', 'Don-gun', 'Bosworth', 'have', 'absolutely', 'chemistry', 'together', 'How', 'can', 'when', 'Yang', 'depicted', 'proverbial', 'lonesome', 'warrior', 'loved', 'one', 'unable', 'give', 'love', 'return', 'moment', 'Ron', 'time', 'Lode', 'Yang', 'learned', 'love', 'simple', 'life', 'especially', 'regard', 'growing', 'tending', 'flowers', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'known', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'Yang', 'rarely', 'face', 'emotion', 'only', 'thing', 'got', 'Warrior', 'Way', 'was', 'knowledge', 'should', ""n't"", 'believe', 'anything', 'drunk']",N/A

1432010,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B004XFZ3UU,David J. Brown,"[2, 3]","This is another one of those films that I saw at the store and thought to myself, ""where the hell did this movie come from?""  I had a similar moment with the film Outlander.  I've never heard of this movie and don't remember it being advertised for.  I looked at the cover art and was bored until my eyes scanned to the name Geoffrey Rush.  Yup, I picked up this film based on that actor's name alone....well, also the story sounded like your typical samurai/Western hybrid.  So, I paid my money and took my chances.  I was pleasantly surprised to be fully engaged by the film and enjoying it for 90 minutes.  It's no masterpiece or revolutionary piece of action cinema, but it's enjoyable and fun.It's similar to Sin City and 300 in tone, and in the fact that it gives an obvious sense that it's totally filmed all in green screen with sets and props scattered about.  The film knew it's limitations and budget and decided to make the obvious background work fit into its style, just like Sin City.  You never once get the impression that any of this is real or weighty, but you do feel the visceral shock and emotion of the story.  The visuals are ramped up to 11, and it all seems very anime' like.  Which is good, even though I am getting oh-so-tired of this by now(especially after finally seeing Sucker Punch).  This film works because it's short and zippy and feels more genuine with its visuals than say Sucker Punch or other green screen films.Also, the acting is all fun.  Kate Bosworth shows up in this film, and while I liked her performance in Wonderland, she is not someone I get excited about when I see her name above a film's title.  She's really good in this film as a knife thrower in a circus.  She is a  spitfire and very plucky.  She has so much pluck in this character one has to wonder why she didn't employ this trait of her acting repetoire in her portrayal of Lois Lane in Superman Returns.  Geoffrey Rush, like always, is great and fun to watch.  He's becoming like Steven Buscemi or Christopher Walken in the sense that no matter how good or bad the film you're watching is when he shows up you are enjoying yourself more, and more perked to attention.  He plays an old drunk ex-gunslinger who has more than a little in common with the film's main protagonist played by Jang Dong Gun.  Gun has natural screen charisma and he manages to play the quiet anti-hero with a past with a twinkle in his eye that makes him seem relateable.  And, egads, and Asian headlining an American film!!!!  Nobody let Hollywood know or it may never happen again.  Danny Houston(30 Days of Night) shows up to play a Western villain with a heinous scar on his face.  He's great and vile, but he must be getting oh so tired of playing the villain in every action movie EVER.  I know I'm tired of seeing him in that role.  Although he wears a pretty cool face mask, and has a thick Western Drawl that makes him unrecognizable, so it all seemed fresh despite his type casting.The plot is irrelevant.  It's pretty simple and combines well worn tropes of both the Western and the Samurai movie, which in a way, those genres have always had a ton in common with each other.  It's all about kinetic action and emotions.  The frames in the film are composed to resemble graphic novels and anime'.  It's very much a case of style over substance and it works.  The characters are intersting enough, but I would've liked to spend more time with them than the film allows before the third act carnage arrives.  But, hey, that's the way modern movies work.  Wouldn't want the brain dead kids to get too bored or invested in people or their emotions.  They might get up to buy more crap to stuff loudly in their faces during the movie.The blu ray looks pristine, as they usually do when shot digitally and made mostly of digital backdrops.  The special features are slim.  We get some deleted scenes, most of which should'v been left in the film, and a short, shorter than usual, EPK type of behind the scenes featurette that shows glimpses of the actors' fight training, and some of the sets with unrendered green screens behind them.  That's it.If you dug this film even a little bit I would suggest seeking out some other likeminded features like Tiashi Miike's Sukyiaki Western Jango and The Good, The Bad and The Weird. They're great, and even better than this film.  This is a fun and brisk time at the movies, but it does not live up to its full potential.  Whether that's due to antsy investors or a lack of budget is beyond me, but I would guess a little of both.

Knox ""Media Junkie""","[1, 2]","First off, if you are expecting something like, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", or, ""Hero"", you are going to be very, very sad.  It seems as though the director was reaching for that sort of status with the film, but the effects just aren't quite up to snuff.  There is definitely an attempt there, as any fans of stylized movies are going to see... but it just doesn't quite get there for some reason.  Perhaps they didn't have the funding to pull it off, or perhaps it was just too difficult for the mind of the viewer (or maybe it was just me, lol) to quite switch gears from western to artistry.That all said, there is a definite feeling here of both the artistry of Asian stylization and anime, as WELL as a western.  I thought it was fun.  Sure the plot wasn't too totally believable or anything, but heck who needs that if the movie is enough fun? :)  I really enjoyed the tortured hero/past villain staying in some low-rent, broken-down, old west town full of ""circus freaks"".  I think they were reaching for surreal there, and it accomplished that much imo.I really enjoyed the dark, brooding looks of our hero (played by Dong-gun Jang).... but honestly Kate Bosworth's character didn't add a whole lot of dimension to the film from how I viewed it, and had a ridiculous accent to boot.  I was raised around tons of different accents and I could hardly take whatever she was attempting there, lol.I see some reviewers are comparing it to Kill Bill and/or Sucker Punch... I personally don't agree.  Kill Bill is one of my favorite movies of all time, but I HATED Sucker Punch.  This wasn't quite a Kill Bill, and it definitely did not have the ""women are only good as victims"" vibe that I got from Sucker Punch.  I get what they're saying as far as the ""look"" of it... but I just don't feel like it reached those standards.  And even though I felt victimized just WATCHING Sucker Punch, I have to admit its look was beautiful, as was Kill Bills.Overall, a definite four stars in my opinion.  If you start off knowing that some of the moves and plot aren't going to be incredibly believable because of the genre, it is a VERY enjoyable movie.

According to IMDB this is this director's first outing and he both directed it and wrote the script. So how is it he gets to work with this cast and this budget? I guess Hollywood moves in mysterious ways but it worked well here.Here's the scoop. A Samurai is in the process of wiping out an entire clan, but when he gets to the final member, an infant, he can't bring himself to do it. He grabs said infant, heads to some bust-out, once was, carnival town in the Badlands and tries to start a new life. Problem is that the town has its own problems and he hasn't quite left his behind. Can he save the town and himself?Take a little Zack Snyder, sprinkle in a bit of Terry Gilliam and you're in for a wild ride. This is not really all that original as far as stories go. What this has going for it is style galore. It's a very good looking movie. At first I thought I was in for a 100 minute video game but it calmed down a bit after the first 15 minutes or so and adopted a calmer look. The visuals though do remain striking. And then there's the acting. This is a great ensemble cast. I can't remember much of what I've seen with Kate Bosworth but she's a real firecracker here. She lights up the screen and plays well against the way more subdued hero. They have a training scene that develops into a dance and it's truly wonderful. Danny Huston and Geoffrey Rush are their usual good selves. The fight scenes are good, the editing, sound, music are all good. The wardrobe deserves special note as well. It's as good here as I've seen in any movie.As I mentioned, the story isn't all that original and I would have enjoyed a deeper look into this oddball group of misfits but this is still better than much that is out there.

I like bizarre screenplays, because it means writers are pushing the envelope. The entire production was filmed in a New Zealand studio on green screen with 90% CGI and actors doing wire flips. This is a Korean film. The production illustrates how producers have blurred the lines of what we think are representative actions of individual countries, the world being one giant corporate entity now. The producers/writers took the overall bizarre histories of individual countries  and overlaid them, trying to make a workable screenplay and this is why the film doesn't work. Let's look at them. Take the American Wild West and the viciousness of overt killing in this sphere, couple it with the viciousness of the Japanese Samurai history (remember this is a Korean film, where there was no such history) and then mix in bizarre, off-the-wall humor of slapstick circus performers and stick them all in the desert with no reason for their overall existence. It is obvious that the writer (apparently on an LSD trip at the time)sought out the most bizarre ideas he could come up with and throwing them all together for some reason thought they would work! Mad Max fans and people on drugs will probably appreciate the total discontinuity of it all. Once again we see producers breaking the number one rule in film making i.e. showing vicious massacre and killing and then trying to make it into a comedy.

In this case the swordplay was beautifully choreographed and performed with ballet precision and supplemented with great CGI effects. Although flying black garbed assassins have been done before I give ""mucho kudos"" to the artful and creative ways they were presented in this story e.g. flying within the bamboo forests, bounding releases water and snow and rooftop landings like eagles nesting.Second, the obvious play off of Carradine's Kung Fu series and Sergio Leone's westerns were creatively and honorably restaged.Third, the superb acting, whether overstated (Bosworth) or understated (Jang), added a mesmerizing surreal quality to the sets and scenes and story itself.Fourth, the music and sound effects were amongst the finest I've heard in any film with a range of expression and genres that blended and enhanced the surreal feel of the story. Visually, in complementing the audio, was the Kandinsky palette of colors contrasted with starkness -  flowers with desert, sunset with wind and Sun bleached wooden buildings.Fifth, the directing and editing produced a recipe that teased every sense, every emotion, every thought from the most violent to the most endearing.  And, to do so while coordinating crews from S. Korea, Australia, India, US, New Zealand - what a journey.Sixth, a suggestion to the writers you failed in only one regard - an homage to Dali embedded within the circus. Perhaps a poster. If you take the landscape from Dali's ""Persistence of Memory"" and replace the watches with the town then you have created ""The Warrior's Way"".

THE WARRIOR'S WAY is an odd duck of a film, and I very much liked it. But, then again, no deep thinker am I. I love bells and whistles.""There lived a warrior, a warrior with empty eyes."" The warrior's name is Yang (Jang Dong-Gun), a stalwart of the ninja clan of the Silent Flutes, and, once upon a time, his greatest ambition was to become the world's finest swordsman. He finally achieves this goal when he defeats the mightiest warrior of a rival clan in single combat. But when he spares the last remaining member of that same rival clan - a baby girl - Yang's own clan places him on the very top of its death list. Yang - carrying a stick with the baby dangling off it like a hobo's bundle - flees to the American West. But the leader of the Silent Flutes - and he's called the Saddest Flute (played by the great Ti Lung) - has vowed epic vengeance for Yang's transgression. America is a sprawling nation, but the Saddest Flute's rancor is as vast as a bottomless abyss. He gives chase.In the odd podunk town of Lode, self-styled the ""Paris of the West,"" over which a shabby ferris wheel looms, Yang and the infant stop for a bit of respite and end up calling Lode their new home. A spirited young lady named Lynne (Kate Bosworth) somehow talks Yang into becoming the local laundryman. She even convinces him to give her blade fighting lessons. Lynne is also walking her own vengeance path.In this eccentric place inhabited in part by circus folk and boozy ex-gunfighters, Yang finds peace of mind and he and the adorable baby rapidly make friends. He hangs up his sword, renders it affixed in its sheath, and so frustrates the Saddest Flute. It is said that should Yang draw his sword, the cries of those he had slaughtered with it will be heard by the Silent Flutes. But when a deranged Colonel (Danny Huston) comes to town, will the laundry warrior stand up for his friends? (This is what's called a rhetorical question.)Anyone who's watched a fair share of cinema will see all the tropes fall into place. THE WARRIOR'S WAY is more flash than substance, similar in that sense to Takashi Miike's SUKIYAKI WESTERN DJANGO and THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE WEIRD. And I'm not dumping on these films, because I enjoyed all three films. But it's like dating a pretty girl and learning that her comfort zone is more Mad Libs than sudoku. It's always neat, of course, to check out these Asian badassses dropping their Eastern mysticism on them unsuspecting buckaroos. THE WARRIOR'S WAY presents a dazzling visual style, and to gaze at the gloriously moody skyscapes is to wonder at the extent of green screen utilized. Although there's a certain vicarious thrill to eyeballing Yang and Lynne as they (sometimes flirtatiously) practice their knife dances, the most dramatic moment may have been when all those ninjas started dropping on the rooftops of Lode, seemingly from the heavens.The Silent Flutes' arrival, in conjunction with the presence of the Colonel and his men, herald the extended fighty fight. This film, by the way, offers up highly stylized but, to be honest, pretty formulaic combat sequences. There's more fun in watching the fighting carnies rise up in defense of their home. Still, you have go give it up for Kate Bosworth's feistiness, Geoffrey Rush's, er, lush performance and his inadvertent half-mooning of the audience, and the cuteness of the baby. The great Ti Lung, who did his damn thing many years ago under the legendary Shaw Brothers banner, is criminally underused here. Meanwhile, Jang Dong-Gun bows to the constrictions of his role, and is properly stoic. I would've loved to have seen more a spark from him. Then maybe I would've bought into his implied romance with Kate Bosworth more. Still, see THE WARRIOR'S WAY for its heap of quirk and for the pretty, pretty sunsets.DVD extras include a Behind-the-Scenes montage (00:02:24 minutes long) and 13 deleted scenes (totaling 00:12:08 minutes).",4,"""This is the story of a sad flute, a laughing baby, and a weeping sword.""",1313798400,"08 20, 2011",2011,4270,"['pretty', 'bells', 'whistles', 'hell', 'derivative', 'plot', 'THE', 'WARRIOR', 'WAY', 'enough', 'oddball', 'charm', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'worth', 'experiencing', 'One', 'themes', 'East', 'wild', 'wild', 'West', 'somewhere', 'David', 'Carradine', 'nodding', 'head', 'smirking', 'Hey', 'familiar', 'THE', 'WARRIOR', 'WAY', 'odd', 'duck', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'liked', 'then', 'again', 'deep', 'thinker', 'am', 'I.', 'love', 'bells', 'whistles', 'lived', 'warrior', 'warrior', 'empty', 'eyes', 'warrior', 'name', 'Yang', 'Jang', 'Dong-Gun', 'stalwart', 'ninja', 'clan', 'Silent', 'Flutes', 'once', 'time', 'greatest', 'ambition', 'was', 'become', 'world', 'finest', 'swordsman', 'finally', 'goal', 'when', 'mightiest', 'warrior', 'rival', 'clan', 'single', 'combat', 'when', 'last', 'remaining', 'member', 'same', 'rival', 'clan', 'baby', 'girl', 'Yang', 'own', 'clan', 'very', 'top', 'death', 'list', 'Yang', 'carrying', 'stick', 'baby', 'dangling', 'off', 'hobo', 'bundle', 'flees', 'American', 'West', 'leader', 'Silent', 'Flutes', 'called', 'Saddest', 'Flute', 'played', 'great', 'Ti', 'Lung', 'vowed', 'epic', 'vengeance', 'Yang', 'transgression', 'America', 'sprawling', 'nation', 'Saddest', 'Flute', 'rancor', 'as', 'vast', 'bottomless', 'abyss', 'chase.In', 'odd', 'podunk', 'town', 'Lode', 'self-styled', 'Paris', 'West', 'shabby', 'ferris', 'wheel', 'looms', 'Yang', 'infant', 'stop', 'bit', 'respite', 'end', 'up', 'calling', 'Lode', 'new', 'home', 'A', 'spirited', 'young', 'lady', 'named', 'Lynne', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'somehow', 'talks', 'Yang', 'becoming', 'local', 'laundryman', 'even', 'give', 'blade', 'fighting', 'lessons', 'Lynne', 'also', 'walking', 'own', 'vengeance', 'path.In', 'eccentric', 'place', 'inhabited', 'part', 'circus', 'folk', 'boozy', 'ex-gunfighters', 'Yang', 'peace', 'mind', 'adorable', 'baby', 'rapidly', 'make', 'friends', 'up', 'sword', 'renders', 'affixed', 'sheath', 'so', 'Saddest', 'Flute', 'said', 'should', 'Yang', 'draw', 'sword', 'cries', 'had', 'slaughtered', 'will', 'be', 'heard', 'Silent', 'Flutes', 'when', 'deranged', 'Colonel', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'town', 'will', 'laundry', 'warrior', 'stand', 'up', 'friends', 'what', 'called', 'rhetorical', 'question', 'Anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'fair', 'share', 'cinema', 'will', 'see', 'tropes', 'fall', 'place', 'WARRIOR', 'WAY', 'more', 'flash', 'substance', 'similar', 'sense', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'SUKIYAKI', 'WESTERN', 'DJANGO', 'THE', 'GOOD', 'THE', 'BAD', 'AND', 'THE', 'WEIRD', ""'m"", 'not', 'dumping', 'films', 'enjoyed', 'three', 'films', 'dating', 'pretty', 'girl', 'learning', 'comfort', 'zone', 'more', 'Mad', 'Libs', 'sudoku', 'always', 'neat', 'course', 'check', 'out', 'Asian', 'badassses', 'dropping', 'Eastern', 'mysticism', 'unsuspecting', 'buckaroos', 'THE', 'WARRIOR', 'WAY', 'dazzling', 'visual', 'style', 'gaze', 'gloriously', 'moody', 'skyscapes', 'wonder', 'extent', 'green', 'screen', 'utilized', 'certain', 'vicarious', 'thrill', 'eyeballing', 'Yang', 'Lynne', 'sometimes', 'flirtatiously', 'practice', 'knife', 'dances', 'most', 'dramatic', 'moment', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'when', 'ninjas', 'started', 'dropping', 'rooftops', 'Lode', 'seemingly', 'heavens.The', 'Silent', 'Flutes', 'arrival', 'conjunction', 'presence', 'Colonel', 'men', 'extended', 'fighty', 'fight', 'film', 'way', 'up', 'highly', 'stylized', 'be', 'honest', 'pretty', 'formulaic', 'combat', 'sequences', 'more', 'fun', 'watching', 'fighting', 'carnies', 'rise', 'up', 'defense', 'home', 'Still', 'have', 'go', 'give', 'up', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'feistiness', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'er', 'lush', 'performance', 'inadvertent', 'half-mooning', 'audience', 'cuteness', 'baby', 'great', 'Ti', 'Lung', 'who', 'did', 'damn', 'thing', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'legendary', 'Shaw', 'Brothers', 'banner', 'criminally', 'underused', 'here', 'Meanwhile', 'Jang', 'Dong-Gun', 'constrictions', 'role', 'properly', 'stoic', 'would', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'spark', 'Then', 'maybe', 'would', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'implied', 'romance', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'more', 'Still', 'see', 'WARRIOR', 'WAY', 'heap', 'quirk', 'pretty', 'pretty', 'sunsets.DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'Behind-the-Scenes', 'montage', '00:02:24', 'minutes', 'long', '13', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'totaling', '00:12:08', 'minutes']",N/A

Take the mysterious swordsman-assassin, Yang, for example. Only briefly is he the world's 2nd greatest swordsman. Then the first falls to his blade. Expected. So is the ""choice"" to kill the last of his clan's enemy's people- a baby girl. When he doesn't (and becomes the epitome of human compassion), he becomes his own clan's number one target hit. The onyl way to ensure his and the baby girl's safety is by travelling to America, where his only contact lives. In a high-and-dried-up circus town.Except, things are not what he thought. His contact no longer around, Yang trying to give up being an assassin, learning to be a normal person despite his dark, blood-tainted past, used to winning, having to learn the simplest things in life. Not all is easy, especially with the crowd that thinks his ebing around won't be helpful. Until their own troubles come back in the form of a highly prideful, scarred captain. Someone with no sense of decency, humanity, willing to kill whoever and worse. And the one person who wants him dead more than anyone else doesn't know she's unprepared to defeat him. Then they find out Yang may be of some use after all. Even when his past comes back, willing to kill any who get in their way to rid him.Some parts of the story may sound archetype, possibly even cliched, but it's balanced out with sequences of immensely stylized action, even if some of what they do defy physics (for anyone who's very picky about movies that present real-life physics realistically, this isn't your movie), as well as some comical one-liners, real-life issues of vengeance, and a unique presentation of a killer learning to be very human, not always seeking reputation, but deciding to help people instead of always slaying.A lot of the characters (including Yang, 8-Ball, Lynne, Ronald, and the baby, April) are very memorably in all they do and say.

Then again there is almost no way you don't notice it from the first moments of the film till the last. Does it make it bad? No, but it does make it different looking than most, actually in a good way.THE WARRIROR'S WAY takes place in the 1900s and tells the story of Yang (Dong-gun Jang), an Asian warrior who has achieved the rank of the best swordsman in I assume is China. Trained since birth for this goal, his job is to eliminate the members of another clan until they are all dead. His goal changes when the last member turns out to be a baby, a child he cannot bring himself to kill. This puts him on the wrong side of the clan and he heads east towards America to start a new life for himself.He settles in a small town out west, a dirt covered little spot that's deteriorating and offers home to a traveling circus that stopped and stayed. An old friend of Yang's had set up shop here but passed away before Yang could arrive. Yang is given the laundry business that his friend owned and trained by a young woman named Lynne (Kate Bosworth).Lynne had been receiving training from Yang's friend in the hope that she could fulfill her desire for revenge on the man that killed her family. Known as the Colonel (Danny Huston), he killed her parents before her eyes and was set to rape her was well until she tossed a pan of hot oil in his face. Shot in the back and left for dead, Lynne survived with the hope of killing the Colonel one day.Stand outs in the town include the town's ""mayor"", a black midget named Eight Ball (Tony Cox) and the town drunk Ron (Geoffrey Rush), a man with a secret all his own. Together they've been trying to erect a giant ferris wheel with the hope of making this town a place people will seek out.But the only people who come seem to be the Colonel and his men who show up one day not long after Yang arrives. Determined not to use his sword since it would magically send a signal to those who seek to destroy him, he finds himself with little or no choice in the matter.As the film moves forward, the townsfolk realize that they must take a stand if they are to survive. Even Ron must confront the ghosts of his past to help. Before long the town isn't just taking on the Colonel but the martial arts warriors who seek to destroy Yang as well. And as with all good western's a showdown is just around the horizon.The film attempts to mix together the western and martial arts genres and for the most part does and admirable job. Revenge has always been something that's played big in both genres and here it combines with two different stories that cross paths.As stated earlier, nearly the entire film was shot on green screen with backgrounds and visuals added later. This gives each scene an eerie sort of feel and look to it, but doesn't harm it in any way. The film SUCKER PUNCH was done almost the same way but where it was distracting in that film it feels more natural here.Fans of the fantasy, western and martial arts genres will find this one entertaining. They'll enjoy the action. Add in a touch of romance here (and it's a small touch at that) and you have a nice rental for the night.",3,GREENSCREEN GALORE,1309392000,"06 30, 2011",2011,3242,"['suppose', 'not', 'right', 'let', 'cat', 'bag', 'film', 'mostly', 'shot', 'green', 'screen', 'Then', 'again', 'almost', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'first', 'moments', 'film', 'last', 'make', 'bad', 'No', 'make', 'different', 'looking', 'most', 'actually', 'good', 'way.THE', 'WARRIROR', 'WAY', 'place', '1900s', 'story', 'Yang', 'Dong-gun', 'Jang', 'Asian', 'warrior', 'who', 'achieved', 'rank', 'best', 'swordsman', 'assume', 'China', 'Trained', 'birth', 'goal', 'job', 'eliminate', 'members', 'clan', 'are', 'dead', 'goal', 'changes', 'when', 'last', 'member', 'out', 'be', 'baby', 'child', 'can', 'not', 'bring', 'kill', 'wrong', 'side', 'clan', 'east', 'towards', 'America', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'himself.He', 'settles', 'small', 'town', 'west', 'dirt', 'covered', 'little', 'spot', 'deteriorating', 'home', 'traveling', 'circus', 'stopped', 'stayed', 'old', 'friend', 'Yang', 'had', 'set', 'up', 'shop', 'here', 'passed', 'away', 'Yang', 'could', 'arrive', 'Yang', 'given', 'laundry', 'business', 'friend', 'owned', 'trained', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Lynne', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', '.Lynne', 'had', 'been', 'receiving', 'training', 'Yang', 'friend', 'hope', 'could', 'fulfill', 'desire', 'revenge', 'man', 'killed', 'family', 'Known', 'Colonel', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'killed', 'parents', 'eyes', 'was', 'set', 'rape', 'was', 'well', 'tossed', 'pan', 'hot', 'oil', 'face', 'Shot', 'back', 'left', 'dead', 'Lynne', 'survived', 'hope', 'killing', 'Colonel', 'one', 'day.Stand', 'town', 'include', 'town', 'mayor', 'black', 'midget', 'named', 'Eight', 'Ball', 'Tony', 'Cox', 'town', 'drunk', 'Ron', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'man', 'secret', 'own', 'Together', ""'ve"", 'been', 'trying', 'erect', 'giant', 'ferris', 'wheel', 'hope', 'making', 'town', 'place', 'people', 'will', 'seek', 'out.But', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'come', 'seem', 'be', 'Colonel', 'men', 'who', 'show', 'up', 'one', 'day', 'not', 'long', 'Yang', 'Determined', 'not', 'use', 'sword', 'would', 'magically', 'send', 'signal', 'who', 'seek', 'destroy', 'little', 'choice', 'matter.As', 'film', 'forward', 'townsfolk', 'realize', 'must', 'take', 'stand', 'are', 'survive', 'Even', 'Ron', 'must', 'confront', 'ghosts', 'past', 'help', 'long', 'town', ""n't"", 'just', 'taking', 'Colonel', 'martial', 'arts', 'warriors', 'who', 'seek', 'destroy', 'Yang', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'western', 'showdown', 'just', 'horizon.The', 'film', 'attempts', 'mix', 'together', 'western', 'martial', 'arts', 'genres', 'most', 'part', 'admirable', 'job', 'Revenge', 'always', 'been', 'something', 'played', 'big', 'genres', 'here', 'two', 'different', 'stories', 'cross', 'paths.As', 'stated', 'earlier', 'nearly', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'green', 'screen', 'backgrounds', 'visuals', 'added', 'later', 'scene', 'eerie', 'sort', 'feel', 'look', ""n't"", 'harm', 'way', 'film', 'SUCKER', 'PUNCH', 'was', 'done', 'almost', 'same', 'way', 'where', 'was', 'distracting', 'film', 'more', 'natural', 'here.Fans', 'fantasy', 'western', 'martial', 'arts', 'genres', 'will', 'find', 'one', 'entertaining', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'action', 'Add', 'touch', 'romance', 'here', 'small', 'touch', 'have', 'nice', 'rental', 'night']",N/A

A ninja type warrior decides not to kill the last survivor of the enemy, the cutest baby ever, and thus begins a journey across the sea to the wild west, with the hopes of avoiding his own people, who of course, now want his head. The story and dialogue are weak, but there are a few moments of comic relief and action sequences that actually work.Korean movie star Dong-gun Jang doesn't say much as the lead character, though that might have been the reason why his performance was actually appealing at times. Kate Bosworth has a pretty face going for her, but that accent was way overdone. Then again, the whole movie is done in an over-the-top comic book style, so I guess she can be forgiven for that. At least she gives her character a good dose of energy and fiestiness. Geoffrey Rush gets a couple of decent moments, but I don't know what in the world he was thinking showing up in a mess like this.I'm really surprised they didn't get rid of all the blood splashing everywhere to get this thing down to a PG-13 rating in order to earn some more money, so I have to give them credit for that.

Things are going pretty well until a long time foe of the town shows up, and he must lead a fight to save the town and its inhabitants; this fight draws the attention of his own pursuers, and now the village must fight off the ninjas as well.(end spoiler)My biggest problem with this film was the ending.

Two genres that are staples of their individual countries are the American western and the Japanese samurai movies, they are dependable and relatively easy to pull with success, they've even been combined with great feat Terence Young'sRed Suncomes to mind. So how is it that ""The Warrior's Way"", with it's solid cast and decent budget ($45 million) failed so miserably. Well, I suspect first off it's because it was made in New Zealand, and shot entirely on a sound stage, and brother does it look it, the sky, the dirt, various background images look cartoonish. Also, a fine cast (starting with Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush) is wasted to make room for a dull leading man, Korean star Dong-gun Jang. The script is oversimplified and very non-compelling, the martial arts action all shot CGI and looking very fake, and a spiritless third act weirdness leaves the audience asking WTF. It is also to quote the movie itself ""slower than molasses in January.""Dong-gun plays Yang, an assassin sent to wipe out his master's arch rival and his family, being an assassin with a heart of gold, as such things go, he fails to be able to carry out his duty when it comes to the infant princess. So samurai with babe in arms leaves for the new world of the American west. He arrives in a one horse town, and he was eaten on Thursday, where a traveling carnival broke down and hasn't broken up since. He befriends the ring leader, a midget called Eight Ball (played by Tony Cox, best known as ""Bad Santa's"" accomplice) and sets his sights on the pretty knife thrower (Kate Bosworth), she helps him with the baby and he helps her with her skills with a blade.However this town is also the picking ground for the Colonel (Danny Huston), a rogue Confederate soldier who wears a mask to hide his disfigured face, he leads a band of merry men, I mean smelly, ugly and cruel men, who make it their life's goal to pick on the circus folk. I mean seriously, their is nothing in this town he could possibly want, but he's always attacking them. Well, I suppose he does have a beef with Lynne, the Kate Bosworth character, because she is the one who disfigured his face, after he killed her father. This all leads to that third act weirdness where Yang gets the carnies to stand up for themselves and put on their war paint. There is an old show biz saying about send in the clowns when the act is dying, guess what, this is where they send in the clowns, no really. Yes, that war paint comment is true, in goes fully painted up clowns, gypsy looking beared ladies, etc. all lead by * Ball looking like the cover of ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"".The cast is unusually good for this type of material (i.e. schlock), Geoffrey Rush does what he can with his role as an old gunslinger who's taken to drink, what demons caused this we never know, it's just the way cliches are made. Rush is much to good for this, coming right off the excellentThe King's Speech, this is the kind of role David Carradine would have been in the running for, but now that he has left this mortal coil, I guess someone has to fill all those bad roles in even worst movies. Danny Huston brings his sly menace to the role, but isn't allowed to do much else, and the disfigured  gunslinger went out with ""Jonah Hex"", possibly for good. The Hong Kong great Ti Lung plays the main Japanese villain, called Saddest Flute, he who wants the baby girl dead, this is his second English language film in nearly forty years, the last being the lame Stuart Whitman vehicle ""Shatter"", with this track record, take forty more. Kate Bosworth is alright, maybe even better than usual, but it is hard to tell in a movie like this, do love that silly southern drawl, though.I suspect this movie will leave western and samurai enthusiasts both cold, I know in the US, reviews were dismal and moviegoer attendance nonexistent. There is no way in which this movie could have ever worked as it is, it is one of the few so truly pure bad movies in recent years where everything is wrong.

A samurai/western set in a desolate circus town (I'm not making that up).  The action is great, and there is a lot of humor, but if you go in like me expecting a full on samurai movie you will be surprised. Overall, I actually enjoyed it, but this is not for everyone.

1432050,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B004XFZ3UU,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","A charmingly bonkers, highly stylised genre mash-up of Asian heroic swordplay movie, Western and circus flick blended together in New Zealand with a Korean star by the people who gave you Outlander, The Warrior's Way was an almost heroically suicidal way to lose $42m, but as long as you're not one of the investors or the many critics who gave it a kicking on it brief theatrical release, there's a lot to enjoy here. Jang Dong-gun is the impassive member of the Sad Flutes assassin clan who kills The Greatest Swordsman in the World (Ever) to become the new Greatest Swordsman in the World (Ever) only to blot his copybook by failing to kill the last child of a rival clan. Instead he runs away with the babe-in-arms to a no-horse ghost town in the Wild West where he sets up a laundry shop with a little prompting from Tony Cox's nutcracking circus dwarf and Kate Bosworth's frontiers gal. Naturally no sooner has he discovered the joys of making things clean and making things grow than Danny Huston's Phantom of the Opera-masked mad Colonel and his army of Hell Riders reappear to wreak havoc on the town once again. Will our hero come to their aid and unseal his sword, letting the voices of his victims reveal his identity to the vengeful clan? What do you think...?If Cowboys and Aliens proved a hard sell to the public, Cowboys, Carnies and Ninjas proved an impossible one: even the poster art for this one was clueless and just threw in the towel. Even more than the premise, the film's tone is pretty off the wall - you'll need a sense of whimsy for this one to work for you. This is a film where every sky and sunset is gloriously painted with no thought of naturalism and where Javier Navarrete's score runs the gamut of spaghetti Western, Ry Cooder folk, slide-guitar rock, grand opera, weeping flutes, taiko drums, rhythmic machine-gun fire and sailor's hornpipe in a way that makes perfect sense in a film like this. Dong-gun makes a charismatic Eastern Eastwood, barely reacting to the insanity around him to great effect, and Kate Bosworth makes a good romantic and comic foil (""Dang, skinny, you sure know how to throw a dead cat into a party room, don't ya?"") but a little of Danny Huston's OTT villainy goes a long way, and the quality does drop when he reappears, taking much of the film's charm with him as the matter-of-fact eccentricity gives way to a last half hour of unrelenting but frequently surreal action and exploding Ferris wheels. The other weak link, surprisingly, is Geoffrey Rush's town drunk with a secret, an underdeveloped role that only gives him a couple of good moments (not only the inevitably tragic backstory but his ending a bit of male bonding with a laundry request: ""Get my jacket clean if you can. If I'm going to die, I want to look good doing it"") and a lot he fails to bring much to.The second half is never as much fun as it could be - as energetically staged as they are, this is one of those films where the action scenes are less memorable than the quieter moments - and it doesn't give The Good, The Bad, The Weird much competition in the Korean Western stakes, but it's still a lot more enjoyable than it's given credit for if you can go along with the weirdness.

An evil gunman and his gang terrorize the townspeople (including circus performers), and so does a horde of flying ninja soldiers. With so many things going on but not much story to tell, ""The Warrior's Way"" is a typical case of style over substance. This is a mishmash of styles, which is often interesting visually, but the film, devoid of a compelling narrative, fails to fully make use of its East-meets-West elements.Set in an alternate world that is far, far away, ""The Warrior's Way"" follows a lonely swordsman Yang (Jang Dong-gun), who disobeyed the order from his own clan Sad Flute, a group of assassins, when he refused to kill a baby of the opposing clan. Yang runs away with the baby from the clan, and settles in a small town of Lode, where he befriends a plucky young woman Lynne (Kate Bosworth).As the town's old drunk Ron (Geoffrey Rush) warns, however, the stranger's arrival is followed by bloody events: return of sadistic Colonel (Danny Huston) and his men, and after that, ninja-like assassins led by Saddest Flute (Ti Lung), Yang's former master.It's not the obvious use of green screen or the numerous borrowed story elements that are really disappointing. The action is very good and Jang Dong-gun as a reluctant hero is not bad. Only that his character is boring. First-time writer-director Sngmoo Lee seems so busy creating visuals (which in themselves are pretty impressive) that he forgets to tell a story - story about fleshed-out characters we care.I know we shouldn't take things too seriously in ""The Warrior's Way."" But the genre-crossing action film, though slightly better than ""Jonah Hex,"" is not fun without characters we relate to.

1432052,A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9,B004XFZ3UU,William Amazzini,"[7, 8]","Writer /Director Sngmoo Lee has created a brilliant homage to the films of Sergio Leone, Run Run Shaw, and Director Buichi Sato's 'LONE WOLF AND CUB/BABY CART' series with this excellent rouser 'THE WARRIOR'S WAY' , never copying the story lines but creating a scenic nostalgia for them. Narrated mystically by British actor Geoffrey Rush, it tells the story of the greatest warrior in the world who massacres a rival warrior clan but spares a female baby, the lone survivor,which sparks the ire of his father causing the warrior to set sail for the old west to start a new life.  Coming upon a deserted, wasted village, he decides to take refuge and becomes entwined in the populace there.  The film then resembles Director Burt Kennedy's western 'WELCOME TO HARD TIMES'-1970 as the outlaws responsible for the decimation of the town return yearly to wreck havoc once again.  Since the warrior lives there, samurai warriors including his father are on a big time revenge spree and the outlaws are caught by surprise.  Besides Rush, feisty Kate Bosworth and great villainy by the brilliant Danny Huston impress with their in-your-face emoting and the warrior is played by Martial Arts pop star Jang Dong Gun performing some sensational moves and sword work.  The film was shot in New Zealand by Woo Yong Kim but it seems that the special visual digital effects were created by an international ensemble from New Zealand, California, Korea, and India giving the circus populace in the village a Fellini-esque visual feel.  Maestro Ennio Morricone is also given a homage by composer Javier Navarrete in a sweeping score with operatic undercurrents. The film is released by 20th Century Fox's Rogue Movie series in a nice 2.35 digital 5.1 transfer and has deleted scenes and a behind the scenes montage as sole extras.
