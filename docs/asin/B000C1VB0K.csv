An odd series about a guy named Goh. Poor Goh. He's a robot pilot, pretty serious and determined, although he can get rather dramatic and sentimental when women are concerned. And a lot of women drop into his lap (and house): his wife, Anna, a 17 year old girl he saved five years ago and who has a mega-hero-worship thing (cannot figure out why Goh chose Anna, tho) who also becomes a robot pilot, although she hasn't told her schoolmates she's married; Mira, the old girlfriend who died but isn't dead and who has come back rather ""out of it""; Lu, the orphan that Goh takes under his wing as a 'daughter'; another robot pilot who has a crush on him; his new wife's busty mother (and his boss); and add a pregnant cat. Every episode seems to need at least one battle where Anna and Goh's robots join together (in fact, every robot needs to do that...why not just create one robot that can do both?), a battle that only Goh and Anna can resolve. Goh can go over the top emotionally, but that's funny, too. There are also a lot of cleavage (but minimal nudity), sexually charged jokes and situations, and random funny stuff. Gotta watch this series.In disk 3, Anna and Goh are trying to live life ""normally"" with Mira as a resident in the house--however, this is causing them a great deal of emotional stress and a strain on the marraige.  Mira's brain still hasn't kicked on yet, so she remembers little.  Meanwhile, Lu manages to get training from Ken, the mysterious robot pilot that is searching for the beast that killed his beloved partner five years ago.  However, when the going gets tough, despite Lu (spoiler!!!) going AWOL, he refuses to let her help.(warning, spoilers) And then things get wierd.  Shizuru fights alone against the Beasts attacking a shuttle and ends up dying by Goh's side (she loves him, too).  Anna, not having realized that her husband has been suffering so much, runs away, not feeling worthy, and is followed by Goh's brother (who loves her, too), who doesn't tell Goh where Anna is.  While Anna is away, Mira brings Shizuru back to life (her eyes flash red!!) somehow!!  Then, Beasts attack in large numbers again, calling on the resources of all Robot Pilots!  As Anna realizes that she really does need Goh, and is attacked by Beast, she is rescued by Goh and...Mira? who has suddenly regained her memories!  What's gunna happen NEXT?????",5,"More Robots, More Drama, More Love Triangles!",1144454400,"04 8, 2006",2006,2486,"['funny', 'charming', 'delightful', 'adventurous', 'romantic', 'melodramatic', 'overall', 'just', 'plain', 'good', 'time', 'odd', 'series', 'guy', 'named', 'Goh', 'Poor', 'Goh', 'robot', 'pilot', 'pretty', 'serious', 'determined', 'can', 'get', 'rather', 'dramatic', 'sentimental', 'when', 'women', 'are', 'concerned', 'lot', 'women', 'drop', 'lap', 'house', 'wife', 'Anna', '17', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'saved', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'who', 'mega-hero-worship', 'thing', 'can', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'Goh', 'chose', 'Anna', 'tho', 'who', 'also', 'robot', 'pilot', ""n't"", 'told', 'married', 'Mira', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'died', ""n't"", 'dead', 'who', 'come', 'back', 'rather', 'Lu', 'orphan', 'Goh', 'wing', ""'daughter"", 'robot', 'pilot', 'who', 'crush', 'new', 'wife', 'busty', 'mother', 'boss', 'add', 'pregnant', 'cat', 'episode', 'need', 'least', 'one', 'battle', 'where', 'Anna', 'Goh', 'robots', 'join', 'together', 'fact', 'robot', 'do', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'create', 'one', 'robot', 'can', 'do', 'battle', 'only', 'Goh', 'Anna', 'can', 'resolve', 'Goh', 'can', 'go', 'top', 'emotionally', 'funny', 'too', 'are', 'also', 'lot', 'cleavage', 'minimal', 'nudity', 'sexually', 'charged', 'jokes', 'situations', 'random', 'funny', 'stuff', 'Got', 'ta', 'watch', 'series.In', 'disk', '3', 'Anna', 'Goh', 'are', 'trying', 'live', 'life', 'normally', 'Mira', 'resident', 'house', 'however', 'causing', 'great', 'deal', 'emotional', 'stress', 'strain', 'marraige', 'Mira', 'brain', 'still', ""n't"", 'kicked', 'yet', 'little', 'Meanwhile', 'Lu', 'get', 'training', 'Ken', 'mysterious', 'robot', 'pilot', 'searching', 'beast', 'killed', 'beloved', 'partner', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'However', 'when', 'going', 'tough', 'Lu', 'spoiler', 'going', 'AWOL', 'let', 'help', 'warning', 'spoilers', 'then', 'things', 'get', 'wierd', 'Shizuru', 'alone', 'Beasts', 'attacking', 'shuttle', 'up', 'dying', 'Goh', 'side', 'too', 'Anna', 'not', 'having', 'realized', 'husband', 'been', 'suffering', 'so', 'much', 'away', 'not', 'feeling', 'worthy', 'followed', 'Goh', 'brother', 'who', 'too', 'who', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Goh', 'where', 'Anna', 'Anna', 'away', 'Mira', 'Shizuru', 'back', 'life', 'eyes', 'flash', 'red', 'somehow', 'Then', 'attack', 'large', 'numbers', 'again', 'calling', 'resources', 'Robot', 'Pilots', 'Anna', 'really', 'need', 'Goh', 'attacked', 'Beast', 'rescued', 'Goh', 'Mira', 'who', 'suddenly', 'regained', 'memories', 'What', 'gunna', 'happen', 'NEXT']",N/A
954260,AES76NP2XT1J1,B000C1VB0K,J. Price,"[0, 0]","This is the first disc I bought from this series.  I bought Godannar from Tower Records when they were going out of business, (I saw the first episode on You Tube and decided to check it out).  All I can say is that I find this show a definite guilty pleasure. I like Giant Robot shows, I like dramatic storylines, and I was sold by the concept that the two Giant Robot Pilots were married.  It is refreshing seeing a female Giant Robot pilot that wasn't a princess or something (see Gundam Seed, Voltron, etc.) But this anime is action packed, quick, In-your-face, and loud.  Screaming commands like in old school anime.  The robot design is clean, cool and realistic (hey not everybody's robot can fly on its own).  I haven't seen that since Escaflowne (manga or anime), but then again, they used magic.The fan service....there is a lot of it.  Necessary and Unnecessary.  I cringe every time they show a panty shot of Lou, a 12 year old space dannar pilot.  The animators also have a lot of fun with Dr. Aoi...Anna's Mom, her breasts always enlarge during any intense situation.  They need to add a giggle counter on this one, because every fight scene, there is some gigglin' goin' on...like the jello commercial.The story is pretty good.  At the end of the disc, I was so pissed at Goh, for always yelling at poor Anna, who's dealing with his ex living with them after she returned from the dead. (HUH?)  Anna's a 17 year girl trying to fit in school, pilot training, being a good wife and battles all into one day.  That's enough to stress anyone out.  My favorite character is ""who the hell do you think I am?!"" Shizuru.  Her determination reminds me of Mokoto from the first season of Sailor Moon.Basically, if you like giant robot shows, a little drama and don't mind a healthy serving of FAN SERVICE...then GODANNAR is for you.Can somebody please tell me where the ""Marriage of god and soul"" is?",5,Godannar!!!

But If I didn't have that 4th disc I would have screamed, volume 3 was just that good! I mean what a way too end the first season. I wish I could say more but there are so many spoilers on this disc that I know I would give something away. One things for sure, if you love Shizuru as I do, then this disc is for you.

954262,A1UU6ETAY6TBRH,B000C1VB0K,Porcupine,"[0, 0]","Godannar Season One ends with amazing high-quality animation and visuals. The quality is back up to par with what was seen in the first DVD. The amount of fighting is more than what was in volume two, but it's not the constant mindless action that defined volume one. Most likely Godannar will remain at this level of action from this point on (which is still a lot).The story does not go as one would predict (based on the volume two preview). Godannar seems to emphasize unpredictability and does everything it can to always be exciting. The last two episodes were especially amazing. Season One doesn't end in either a resolution or a cliffhanger, but it does have a definitive ending. It doesn't just leave off for Season Two to continue. It's a very creative ending, in my opinion.It's amazing to me that a show this good was ever produced. It seems so much better than anything else I've ever seen. A lot of people don't seem to agree with these sentiments though, so the only thing I can say for sure is that there are some things that are good about Godannar which some people really appreciate, although many others don't.",5,Awesome!!,1140480000,"02 21, 2006",2006,1131,"['Godannar', 'Season', 'One', 'amazing', 'high-quality', 'animation', 'visuals', 'quality', 'back', 'up', 'par', 'what', 'was', 'seen', 'first', 'DVD', 'amount', 'fighting', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'volume', 'two', 'not', 'constant', 'mindless', 'action', 'defined', 'volume', 'one', 'Most', 'likely', 'Godannar', 'will', 'remain', 'level', 'action', 'point', 'still', 'lot', '.The', 'story', 'not', 'go', 'one', 'would', 'predict', 'based', 'volume', 'two', 'preview', 'Godannar', 'emphasize', 'unpredictability', 'everything', 'can', 'always', 'be', 'exciting', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'were', 'especially', 'amazing', 'Season', 'One', ""n't"", 'end', 'resolution', 'cliffhanger', 'have', 'definitive', 'ending', ""n't"", 'just', 'leave', 'off', 'Season', 'Two', 'continue', 'very', 'creative', 'ending', 'opinion.It', 'amazing', 'show', 'good', 'was', 'ever', 'produced', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'anything', 'else', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'lot', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'agree', 'sentiments', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'sure', 'are', 'things', 'are', 'good', 'Godannar', 'people', 'really', 'appreciate', 'many', 'others', 'do', ""n't""]",N/A
