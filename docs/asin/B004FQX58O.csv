1405233,A16TTO0XISBJF0,B004FQX58O,Budas Root,"[3, 8]","This intriguing indie neo-noir is very much in the style of Hong Kong auteur Wong Kar-Wai; in fact, it's the most serious and successful tribute to Wong's bleakly romantic films that I have ever seen.  There are lingering, artfully lit close-ups, sudden time shifts and almost ritualized repetitions, moody use of color, and a deliberate spilling over of fantasy into reality.  More happens in the characters' heads than in their lives, and when the fantasy is this gorgeous and entrancing, I always go along for the ride.  Also, the voiceover is philosophical and musing, like Chungking Express or Happy Together, rather than redundantly telling you what you already know from the visuals and dialogue.  Very smart.  Other things that are exciting about this film: Julianne Nicholson, wonderful as the good girl in Tully, gets cast against type as a sexy femme fatale; the Waitress from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia makes it to the big screen (can the brilliant Kaitlin Olson et al. be far behind?); James Franco's mussed raven locks are channeling Ulli Lommel's from the early 1970s.  Look, every performance Franco gives now is worth checking out, and with Jay Anania, Franco seems to have found a director who can enhance his smoldering fatalism with just enough cool mise en scene.  Let's hope they develop a Cronenberg-Mortensen-type collaborative relationship.",5,In the style of Wong Kar-Wai,1307750400,"06 11, 2011",2011,1372,"['intriguing', 'indie', 'neo-noir', 'very', 'much', 'style', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'auteur', 'Wong', 'Kar-Wai', 'fact', 'most', 'serious', 'successful', 'tribute', 'Wong', 'bleakly', 'romantic', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'are', 'lingering', 'artfully', 'lit', 'close-ups', 'sudden', 'time', 'shifts', 'almost', 'ritualized', 'repetitions', 'moody', 'use', 'color', 'deliberate', 'spilling', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'More', 'happens', 'characters', 'heads', 'lives', 'when', 'fantasy', 'gorgeous', 'entrancing', 'always', 'go', 'along', 'ride', 'Also', 'voiceover', 'philosophical', 'musing', 'Chungking', 'Express', 'Happy', 'Together', 'rather', 'redundantly', 'telling', 'what', 'already', 'know', 'visuals', 'dialogue', 'Very', 'smart', 'Other', 'things', 'are', 'exciting', 'film', 'Julianne', 'Nicholson', 'wonderful', 'good', 'girl', 'Tully', 'cast', 'type', 'sexy', 'femme', 'fatale', 'Waitress', 'Always', 'Sunny', 'Philadelphia', 'big', 'screen', 'can', 'brilliant', 'Kaitlin', 'Olson', 'et', 'al', 'be', 'far', 'James', 'Franco', 'mussed', 'raven', 'locks', 'are', 'channeling', 'Ulli', 'Lommel', 'early', '1970s', 'Look', 'performance', 'Franco', 'now', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'Jay', 'Anania', 'Franco', 'have', 'found', 'director', 'who', 'can', 'enhance', 'smoldering', 'fatalism', 'just', 'enough', 'cool', 'mise', 'en', 'scene', 'Let', 'hope', 'develop', 'Cronenberg-Mortensen-type', 'collaborative', 'relationship']",N/A

Too say that it is slow is a major understatement. A three hour movie about watching paint dry would be far more exciting and stimulating than this dreadful movie.All these characters are passing through life just waiting for death to take them. The lead character is the only actor that was lucky enough to die by the end of the movie.This movie goes nowhere, has no message and is guarenteed to depress you even if you are otherwise in a great mood before watching it.This movie seems far longer than it really is and should not have been longer than ten minutes in any event. It simply was the very long way of telling a very short story. There is only one gunshot during the movie. For the sake of these actors, there should have been many more.Street low-life meets drug king who caters mostly to drug addicted hookers. He fails to follow every order explicity and is shot to death, fortunately. Death is far better than continuing his miserable and meaningless life, which had absolutely no place to go.Terrible screenwriting. Not one character has any point or purpose, not one is slightly likeable and nothing of value can be taken away from this pathetic excuse of a movie.Sorry, just trying to save anyone else from spending money or waisting anytime on this garbage.

1405236,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004FQX58O,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","There will likely be a small audience for this artistic little cinematic treasure SHADOWS AND LIES, but while the audiences crowd in line for the multi-million dollar retreads of comic book heroes and potty mouth 'guy or chick flicks' it is reassuring that there are experimentalists like writer/director/editor Jay Anania and his pupil, the multitalented James Franco who continue to push the edge of cinema and create the challenges of this jewel-like film.Anania opens his film with a dark in medias res raw episode that quickly moves to an image of Joseph (James Franco) missing his flight to Japan because he steps out of line to retrieve a book. The plane crashes, killing everyone on board, and that opens the doors for Joseph to move to Manhattan to have a new life: he becomes William Vincent, a strange loner/drifter who has a job editing nature films for schools in a sparse storefront abode and also performs petty crimes. What gradually becomes apparent is that we maybe re-visiting what happened four years ago: William Vincent, a quiet and mysterious criminal, falls for a New York gangster's (Josh Lucas) favorite call girl Ann (Julianne Nicholson), after performing some 'deliveries' arranged by one Victor (Martin Donavan). When William's feelings are discovered Vincent is forced to flee the city, threatened with death if he should ever return. But after four years in exile (? in Japan), William secretly returns to rescue Ann from the life of derision and fear she is leading. There are quirky moments in the film where William is in the park and 'sees and talks to' two young brothers - Ty and Lewis played by Ty and Lewis Anania - who may simply be a part of William's previous existence as Joseph. But it is this very disturbing interchange of time sequences that makes the film so powerful - are we watching the now or are we watching the then, and if we are seeing the past, how does the ending make sense? Another observer states it this way: 'The story of William Vincent as he recounts the eccentric and curious path that has brought him, at mortal risk, to New York City, after four years in exile, to rescue a woman he scarcely knows, Ann, from the vague crime syndicate that first brought them together.'Franco is disturbingly brilliant as this strange character Joseph/William and the scenes that simply sit in silence with Franco barely outlined by terrific lighting effects or interacting in spare dialogue with Ann or Victor or the Boss are visually and emotionally stunning. The cinematography by Daniel Vecchione is moody, dark and always appropriate in adding mystery to the story. John Medeski's musical score is primarily a few piano notes and the wheezing sounds of an odd organ (melodica) instrument played by a street person. It all simply works as a brilliant film. Some may label this 'film noir': it is more like experimental 'noir film noir' at every level.

You get 90 minutes of boring, pointless dribble. There was absolutely NO point to this thing being made. I don't understand why Franco would even think of being in this mess.We get 90 minutes of William (a permed up Franco) wandering the streets at night, looking at fish on his computer and staring at people.

Lethal injection or drifting into a slow death would be more exciting than this movie.And let's talk about those scenes. Mold grows faster than those scenes. It's not slow paced, try NO paced! What got me was how people would be talking and then they would stop and stare at each other for about five minutes in mid-sentence while some dude plays the organ in the background for the entire movie!
