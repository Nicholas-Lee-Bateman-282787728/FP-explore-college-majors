That is a for sure way to tell that this is fake, I have heard everyone who got these bootlegs tell me that it is bootleg and it spelled wrong on top. Don't be fooled. I hope everyone is able to read this and not be fooled. I'm sorry to say but the only way you want one of these you have to fork over lots of money for it. I was lucky to grab this at best buy when it first came out when it was less than 100$. I have to say its worth the purchase if you are a fan of Batman TAS.",1,Don't be fooled.

That being the case, it's not fair that they give this set a bad review, they probably never even watched it. It's an awesome series that reinvents the main character and the villains. The final season even has Superman, Green Arrow and other Justice Leaguers.",5,Best Batman Series Ever !!,1371686400,"06 20, 2013",2013,391,"['negative', 'reviews', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'animated', 'series', 'thought', 'was', 'live', 'action', 'one', '60', 'being', 'case', 'not', 'fair', 'give', 'set', 'bad', 'review', 'probably', 'never', 'even', 'watched', 'awesome', 'series', 'main', 'character', 'villains', 'final', 'season', 'even', 'Superman', 'Green', 'Arrow', 'other', 'Justice', 'Leaguers']",The Batman: The Complete Series
1234378,A2LHONR6S07VPX,B001RXB49K,fozzy,"[1, 1]","I bought this series recently through Amazon.  FIRST OFF: This is the series from around 2003-2008.  This isn't the classic series from the 90's, so don't look here.A friend of mine advised me to check it out.  I was skeptical at first by the DVD covers, but when I started watching it, I enjoyed the adventures.  The animation takes a more kiddy/cartoony approach (As best as I can describe it).  It's probably why some people aren't interested about it.  On the other hand, the story lines aren't bad at all.  There are some entertaining episodes in this series.The creator of this series also takes an interesting spin on villians such as the Joker, the Riddler, & Bane.  It's a different approach, but it works for this series.I prefer Batman: The Animated Series, but honestly The Batman isn't bad.  I won't sit here and compare the two since they both have their own takes.  Is The Batman the best series based on the iconic superhero?  No, but a solid approach to this dark defender of justice. Watch The Batman, and make your on conclusions.  If you like it, then own it.  Hopefully you'll enjoy it.",4,It's good for what it is.,1346371200,"08 31, 2012",2012,1107,"['bought', 'series', 'recently', 'Amazon', 'FIRST', 'OFF', 'series', '2003-2008', ""n't"", 'classic', 'series', '90', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'here.A', 'friend', 'mine', 'advised', 'check', 'out', 'was', 'skeptical', 'first', 'DVD', 'covers', 'when', 'started', 'watching', 'enjoyed', 'adventures', 'animation', 'more', 'kiddy/cartoony', 'approach', 'As', 'best', 'can', 'describe', 'probably', 'why', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'interested', 'other', 'hand', 'story', 'lines', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'are', 'entertaining', 'episodes', 'series.The', 'creator', 'series', 'also', 'interesting', 'spin', 'villians', 'such', 'Joker', 'Riddler', 'Bane', 'different', 'approach', 'series.I', 'prefer', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'honestly', 'Batman', ""n't"", 'bad', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sit', 'here', 'compare', 'two', 'have', 'own', 'Batman', 'best', 'series', 'based', 'iconic', 'superhero', 'No', 'solid', 'approach', 'dark', 'defender', 'justice', 'Watch', 'Batman', 'make', 'conclusions', 'like', 'then', 'own', 'Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'enjoy']",The Batman: The Complete Series

This show while watchable, I cannot believe as to how childish and watered down this was compared to the 1990's version, and how ridiculously bad certain things were, like when The Joker (his voice sucked by the way) turned into Bane, yeah, anyways, I think what really got to me was the look of the show more than anything, it reminded me of an anime movie or something, which I HATE anime, I confess that I don't HATE this show.
