1436135,A1ZR7H9LU80VUC,B0050YC82E,"Bradley A. Beaupain ""US Video critic""","[2, 3]","This season of SMDM brought us even more exciting adventures. It opens with the 2 part story, ""The Return of the Bionic Woman"" and also includes the popular ""Secret of Bigfoot"" 2 part episodes. Probably the most watched episodes of the entire 3rd season. This set, identical to that released a few years ago by TimeLife, also features the Spinoff episodes of ""The Bionic Woman"" series. There seems to be some disagreement by the archival records as to whether or not the first episode was a SMDM episode and the 2nd part was the 1st episode of the BW series but as shown on this set, they appear to both be from the BW series, although SCI-FI Channel had broadcast Part 1 with closing credits from the SMDM version....(I have the tape to prove that somewhere)nevertheless, its great to see older shows being able to get their due on DVD.  Could you imagine if we were still stuck with VHS tapes, each complete season would consist of 12 tapes and that's a lot of shelf space. If it weren't for DVD, over half the shows we watched probably would never appear for purchase...ever. The overall video and audio quality is broadcast quality, a bit grainy, but keep in mind this series was shot on film, not videotape.

Like most 40-50 year olds, this was my favorite series when growing up in the 70's.  Sure the special effects are not all CGI and glossy like they are today, but they're not bad for the time and heaven knows even the worst stript and plot for TSMDM is ten times better than half of the sci-fi trash that is put out there now days.  Lee Majors was made for the role and may be more assoicated with it than just about any actor could be with a role.  I agree with most that season Two was probably better overall, but this is the first season we all got to see Steve Austin take on that other 70's icon &#34;Bigfoot&#34;.  That alone makes this five stars.  Harve Bennett was on top of his game when producing this series and Richard Anderson as Oscar Goldman may be as famous for that role as Majors was with Austin.

While I enjoy him in his other Big Valley and Fall Guy series, this is the perfect role for him, the right actor playing the right character at just the right time.  He's the prototype for what a man can be, strong yet sensitive and caring about others.  He shows me how to be a better man.

The Six Million Dollar Man was and still is one of my all-time favorite shows. The introduction of The Bionic Woman (which of course actually began at the end of season two) did not capture my interest, then or now. It's nothing against Lindsay Wagner, let alone Jamie Summers ... but Steve Austin was unique and I guess I wanted him to remain that way. In fairness to Jamie / Lindsay, I felt this way every time another ""bionic"" character was introduced (mostly in the movies that aired years after the series ended).All that said, season 3 does have some wonderful episodes and is a must-have for fans of the series. In addition to seeing Steve going undercover as a lumberjack, a longshoreman and even a police officer, he meets up with Big Foot for the first time. The 2-part Big Foot episode is reason enough for Six Million Dollar Man fans to get a hold of season 3. I can still remember seeing the Big Foot episode when I was very young and also remember Universal Studios having a Bionic Show and other SMDM related attractions at the time. In fact, the rotating tunnel is still a part of their tram tour and it always reminds me of Steve Austin and Big Foot. Seasons 1 and 2 are better overall, in my opinion, but that doesn't mean that season 3 should be missed.

This season also contains the two part ""Secret of Bigfoot"" episodes with ""Andre The Giant"" in the title role.  As has been noted in other reviews, Bigfoot sightings were a big deal at that time so quite topical and I was simply spellbound when it originally aired.  Stefanie Powers also was absolutely gorgeous as an alien in this one.  Several other episodic attempts were made at ""Bigfoot"" in subsequent seasons but none held the charm of this first outing.In between these two bookends, there are some other episodes in Season Three worthy of mention.  ""The Seven Million Dollar Man"" returns for a second engagement in ""The Bionic Criminal"".  Although not quite as good as the first episode from Season Two, it is still pretty solid.  There are also several amusing episodes such as ""The Song and Dance Spy"" guest starring Sonny Bono and two episodes where our Hero Col. Steve Austin tangles with more local type criminals in ""The White Lightning War"" and ""Target in the Sky"" which are all enjoyable entries.  For football enthusiasts, another change of pace is offered in ""One of Our Running Backs is Missing"" which featured Larry Cszonka and Dick Butkus as well as Carl Weathers of ""Rocky-Apollo Creed"" Fame in an early role.  ""The Winning Smile"" is another episode featuring Oscar Goldman's Secretary, Peggy Callahan, who became a semi-regular shortly thereafter on both the ""Six Million Dollar Man"" and ""Bionic Woman"" Series.Overall, I can't give this season Five Stars like Season Two but all in all, a very good season with several excellent episodes so not to be overlooked!",4,Bionic Woman & Bigfoot are the Highlights!,1357516800,"01 7, 2013",2013,2018,"['Season', 'Three', 'Six', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Man', 'not', 'offer', 'quite', 'many', 'high', 'quality', 'episodes', 'Season', 'Two', 'was', 'high', 'water', 'mark', 'series', 'pretty', 'close', 'show', 'was', 'maturing', 'many', 'levels', 'Return', 'Bionic', 'Woman', 'off', 'Season', 'Three', 'grand', 'style', 'two-part', 'episode', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'episodes', 'introduced', 'great', 'character', 'Jaime', 'S.', 'season', 'earlier', 'season', 'also', 'two', 'part', 'Secret', 'Bigfoot', 'Andre', 'Giant', 'title', 'role', 'been', 'noted', 'other', 'reviews', 'Bigfoot', 'sightings', 'were', 'big', 'deal', 'time', 'so', 'quite', 'topical', 'was', 'simply', 'spellbound', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'Stefanie', 'Powers', 'also', 'was', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'alien', 'one', 'Several', 'other', 'episodic', 'attempts', 'were', 'made', 'Bigfoot', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'none', 'held', 'charm', 'first', 'outing.In', 'two', 'bookends', 'are', 'other', 'episodes', 'Season', 'Three', 'worthy', 'mention', 'Seven', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Man', 'second', 'engagement', 'Bionic', 'Criminal', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'episode', 'Season', 'Two', 'still', 'pretty', 'solid', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'amusing', 'episodes', 'such', 'Song', 'Dance', 'Spy', 'guest', 'starring', 'Sonny', 'Bono', 'two', 'episodes', 'where', 'Hero', 'Col.', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'more', 'local', 'type', 'criminals', 'White', 'Lightning', 'War', 'Target', 'Sky', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'entries', 'football', 'enthusiasts', 'change', 'pace', 'offered', 'One', 'Running', 'Backs', 'Missing', 'featured', 'Larry', 'Cszonka', 'Dick', 'Butkus', 'as', 'well', 'Carl', 'Weathers', 'Rocky-Apollo', 'Creed', 'Fame', 'early', 'role', 'Winning', 'Smile', 'episode', 'featuring', 'Oscar', 'Goldman', 'Secretary', 'Peggy', 'Callahan', 'who', 'became', 'semi-regular', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'Six', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Man', 'Bionic', 'Woman', 'Series.Overall', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'season', 'Five', 'Stars', 'Season', 'Two', 'very', 'good', 'season', 'several', 'excellent', 'episodes', 'so', 'not', 'be', 'overlooked']",N/A

Steve Austin(Lee Majors)who nearly died after being seriously injured on a mission and gets rescued by Agent Oscar Goldman(Richard Anderson)from the Office of Scientific Intelligence and gets rebuilt by Dr. Rudy Wells(Martin E.
