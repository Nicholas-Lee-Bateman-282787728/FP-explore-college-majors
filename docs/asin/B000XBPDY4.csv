She'd been apprenticing for 8 months to senior ex-policeman who had been pushed out of the &#34;Met&#34; into private investigations.  Our protagonist has learned lots, but not all, about the &#34;game&#34;.  She is intuitive and can cut through the layers of deception suspects and witnesses often provide.  Yet there is a somewhat naive or gullible side to her nature, allowing her to make mistakes.  But she learns from them.  The emotionality of the protagonist is initially distanced and nonempathetic.  As the episodes develop, emotional growth is slowly coming to her.  I suppose the series could have gone another season or two, allowing us to see more of the blossoming of her personality.

1113895,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B000XBPDY4,C. O. DeRiemer,"[32, 34]","""Always trust your instinct,"" says aging, over-weight Bernie Pryde, owner of the barely busy Pryde Detective Agency, to the young woman seated next to him at the pub. ""Always listen to the inner voice."" Bernie is an ex-cop, forced out by Detective Chief Superintendent Ferguson.""It's easy for Chief Superintendent Ferguson,"" Cordelia Gray replies, referring to the copper she dislikes but Bernie admires. ""It's a regular salary in CID even when the inner voice is talking rubbish.""""Don't mock it,"" Bernie tells her. ""Everything I've been teaching you comes from him.""Cordelia Gray (Helen Baxendale) is a young woman in her early twenties who came to Bernie as a temp. She stayed on as his assistant and he has been teaching her the ways and methods of a private investigator. She has come to look upon him as something as a mentor. He thinks hiring her is one of the best things he's ever done. And when Bernie Pryde commits suicide one early morning in the office (his note to Cordelia tells her he has cancer which will only get worse) she learns that Bernie has left her everything he has...the detective agency, the building it's in with an apartment, and an old car that barely runs. There's no money and no clients. The only person Cordelia can rely on is the middle-aged office manager, Edith Sparshott (Annette Crosbie), a bit of an upright puritan whose protective instincts come into play.When a prominent scientist a few days later hires her to investigate why his son hanged himself, Cordelia has her first case. It's a doozy. Before long she finds herself staying in the country cottage where the young man died, meeting his Cambridge friends who all agree the fellow was a nonentity, and learning secrets involving inheritance, maternal death, sexual experiments and driving egomania. She also learns it can be exhausting to survive if one is thrown down a deep well late at night. Most of all, perhaps, she learns why several people believe that being a private detective is an unsuitable job for a woman. Cordelia solves the case, but there is much unhappiness to deal with. She skirts the law to try to make things bearable for one of the characters. At the end, Chief Superintendent Ferguson comes to visit. He wants her to know he realizes what happened and what Cordelia finally did...and he admits that he didn't think Bernie Pryde could be such a good teacher.This first episode, Sacrifice (1997), in the four episode series of An Unsuitable Job for a Woman, is a mystery with lots of hidden motives and a few false leads. Like the following three stories, the mystery is serious, complicated and plays fair with the audience. The writing is first rate and the acting is just as good. Helen Baxendale as Cordelia Gray gives us a young woman who takes her job seriously. She's smart and, at times, intuitive. More than anything, she's persistent. Despite all that she learned from Bernie, she still has much more to learn. She can be quite uncertain of the next move. She doesn't obviously rely on Edith Sparshott, but Edith is not about to let Cordelia simply stumble into obvious danger. They make an interesting pair.Sacrifice takes us along in three parts running about three hours. The mystery keeps us guessing and the actors, including Ian McDiarmid, Rosemary Leach, Phyllis Logan and Frank Middlemass, help keep us involved. The other Cordelia Gray episodes, A Last Embrace (1998), Living on Risk (1999) and Playing God (2001), run not quite two hours each. A Last Embrace is just about as serious and complicated as The Sacrifice, and features two fine performances by Gemma Jones and Leigh Lawson. They all are fine, well written stories.We leave Cordelia Gray at the conclusion of the last story, Playing God, as the owner of the Gray Detective Agency, somewhat more assured, secure in her relationship with Edith Sparshott...and pregnant (as was Helen Baxendale at the time). The child came about from a relationship with a man Cordelia liked and admired, a man dying and who, Cordelia tells Edith, she didn't love but was probably trying to comfort. We have no doubt Cordelia Gray will continue solving cases, even though a detective has already told her that being a private investigator is an unsuitable job for a mother.The four episodes make up the DVD set An Unsuitable Job for a Woman - Series 1 & 2. There are no extras of any significance. The DVD transfer looks fine. The Cordelia Gray character, incidentally, was created by P. D. James, who also brought us Commander Adam Dalgliesh. In James' mystery novel which introduced Cordelia Gray, An Unsuitable Job for a Woman, it is Dalgliesh Cordelia must deal with, not DCS Ferguson.",4,"A fine set of four mysteries, with Helen Baxendale
