It's just that I'm not up on current films and videos, so some of this went past me, I didn't quite know what they were mocking. The Titanic parody was great, but what I really loved was the Cher And Her Wigs spoof. I hope to see more from these two.

875232,A1JUUQ9N15R0LE,B0006Z2KZW,Laurie Lear,"[17, 19]","I have always been a fan of Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French; they are the funniest actresses in the world, bar none. And after four DVDs were released of some of their best sketches, I was sure that this was all that was going to be shown in America. But, I have been proven wrong, for here is the first of two new DVDs being released by BBC - DVD! Clearly, you can see that this DVD will include the hilarious special for ""Titanic"" but it will also include the spoof on ""Making-of"" documentaries that is hosted by Jennifer Saunders co-star Joanna Lumley from ""Absolutely Fabulous""! At this moment there isn't much information on what else will be included, but in a recent BBC America cataloge it stated that this DVD will have 4 1/2 hours of F&S which is quite a lot more than the other DVDs, which usually run for not even two hours! So, it seems we might be getting closer to having nearly every moment from the long-running series avalible here in America! Mark your calender, because French and Saunders : On the Rocks and Back with a Vengance will be released on March 1st! Also, on a side note, if you want a copy of BBC's hit soap opera ""EastEnders"" (which will be released publicly on March 1st as well), you can find a copy on the BBC America Shop website for sale...right now! It has been on sale there for almost a month already, so if you want this copy you can get it on bbcamericashop.com before most! If only they would do it with these DVDs.....",5,A New Round of French & Saunders DVDs!,1107734400,"02 7, 2005",2005,1465,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Jennifer', 'Saunders', 'Dawn', 'French', 'are', 'funniest', 'actresses', 'world', 'bar', 'none', 'four', 'DVDs', 'were', 'released', 'best', 'sketches', 'was', 'sure', 'was', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'shown', 'America', 'have', 'been', 'proven', 'wrong', 'here', 'first', 'two', 'new', 'DVDs', 'being', 'released', 'BBC', 'DVD', 'Clearly', 'can', 'see', 'DVD', 'will', 'include', 'hilarious', 'special', 'Titanic', 'will', 'also', 'include', 'spoof', 'Making-of', 'documentaries', 'hosted', 'Jennifer', 'Saunders', 'co-star', 'Joanna', 'Lumley', 'Absolutely', 'Fabulous', 'moment', ""n't"", 'much', 'information', 'what', 'else', 'will', 'be', 'included', 'recent', 'BBC', 'America', 'cataloge', 'stated', 'DVD', 'will', 'have', '4', '1/2', 'hours', 'F', 'S', 'quite', 'lot', 'more', 'other', 'DVDs', 'usually', 'run', 'not', 'even', 'two', 'hours', 'So', 'might', 'be', 'getting', 'closer', 'having', 'nearly', 'moment', 'long-running', 'series', 'avalible', 'here', 'America', 'Mark', 'calender', 'French', 'Saunders', 'Rocks', 'Back', 'Vengance', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'March', '1st', 'Also', 'side', 'note', 'want', 'copy', 'BBC', 'hit', 'soap', 'EastEnders', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'publicly', 'March', '1st', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'find', 'copy', 'BBC', 'America', 'Shop', 'website', 'sale', 'right', 'now', 'been', 'sale', 'almost', 'month', 'already', 'want', 'copy', 'can', 'get', 'bbcamericashop.com', 'most', 'only', 'would', 'do', 'DVDs', '..']",French & Saunders - On the Rocks
