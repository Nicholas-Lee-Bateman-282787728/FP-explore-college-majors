It has a little of everything:  Romance, scariness (but not bloody/gory) and an interesting backstory for the main female lead.  I wish there would have been a little bit more backstory for the main male lead.  The special effects were done well.  They were minimal but effective enough to enhance the plot along they way.  Overall, I liked the entire way this movie was written, directed and produced.I really liked both main actors in this movie, Ye-Jin Son and and Min-Ki Lee.  They were excellent for these roles.  I will be looking for more shows with them in it.  If you like having a romance, tied in with a slightly scary storyline then this movie is for you.  I'll be watching it again very soon.  I highly recommend this movie.",5,"I laughed, jumped and got goosebumps!

1603045,AOHQAJRWKEDY6,B009XEANH4,"Ukegirl ""Jill, OldTime Film Fan""","[4, 4]","I loved this wonderful South Korean combination horror - comedy - romance film from 2011 called Spellbound (title is Chilling Romance in Korea).The film stars Ye-Jin Son from The Classic and A Moment To Remember, and Min-Ki Lee from Tidal Wave. Min-kee plays a street magician who is intrigued by a girl (Ye-Jin) who stands and watches his magic act but who never smiles. In fact, she looks miserable all the time. Finally he builds up the courage to follow her and confront her and this leads to a brainstorm in which he builds a stage act magic show based on the netherworld. She is hired to play a ghost in his show but unknown to him she has a real ghost who pursues her and that is why she lives alone and has no friends except for a handful she only talks to on the phone -- she doesn't want to put their lives in jeopardy. The stage show becomes wildly popular. Even though the magician has another girlfriend he finds himself growing closer and closer to the sad woman in his show who plays the ghost.Sometimes films like these, which try to incorporate layers of both horror, romance, and comedy, simply don't work because the audience becomes confused as to which subject matter is supposed to be dominant. Should they be scared of the ghost, or laugh at it? Does the magician become intrigued by his employee because he is frightened of her, because the entire company laughs at her behind her back, is he concerned for her as a human being, or because he might actually be falling in love with her? This film does work though, partly because it doesn't take itself too seriously, and partly because the actors are just so darn good they'd be convincingly seamless in anything!Gorgeous Ye-Jin Son does not look one day older in this film from 2011 than she did in 2003's The Classic. She is perfect in this film, especially the unforgettable scene where she finally admits to her phone girl friends how sad and miserable she is living all alone.It's mind-boggling to me how all these Korean actors never seem to age! It took a bit of time for me to warm to Min-Ki Lee's character, I didn't consider him all that handsome at first, but he grew on me and by the end of the film he looked quite attractive. He was especially good in the comedic scenes.I love the Korean films and shows because they dare to show the personal growth of characters, often from shallow and selfish, to compassionate and caring. They aren&#8217;t afraid of sentimentality in their scripts, whereas Hollywood often looks down on it. Who cares about reading subtitles when they open the doors to exceptional films like this one!
