1363586,A1IB9XKSYUGPGI,B003UD7J6W,A. Schafer,"[4, 7]","This season of True Blood had many great things that last season didn't have. I liked how most of the storylines tied together in the second half of the season, which was a big problem with the third season. I also liked how they've focused more on the core characters and give less screentime to boring characters that noone cares about, not to mention Alexander Skaarsgard being promoted to a lead which should have been done in Season 3. I loved how much care they took with the Sookie and Eric relationship. It wasn't perfect and they made Eric a little too regretful, but you can't get everything you want. Overall I felt it was a job well done. Bill was made King of Louisiana, which is a bit ridiculous, but it served it's purpose in showing just how much of a hypocrite his and how deluded he really is about himself and his own morality.Jessica was brilliant, so was Lafayette, and they were some surpising twists and turns. Debbie Pelt was played extremely well by Brit Morgan. Great job on her part for making Debbie sympathetic. Alexander Skaarsgard was amazing as always, basically portraying two different sides of the same character.The main villain Marnie wasn't as good as Russell Edgington of Season 3, but she was played very well by Fiona Shaw and it brought a new supernatural element to the series.As a fan of the books I don't mind the differences and they stick to the basic template and fill in the details. Bill has too much of a role but the good far outweighs the bad. And they made sure to protray the Eric/Sookie relationship as the love that is was in the books, even with a semi different approach, so I'm very happy with that.All in all, a very good season and I look forward to next season, especially seeing more of Eric and Sookie, Jessica, Pam, Lafayette, and the return of Russell Edginton.The one main criticism I have is that they need to focus more on the vampires and less on the side characters. The vampires are the most interesting, especially Eric, Pam, and Jessica.Note: People giving this one star because of shipping, seriously??? This is a review of the PRODUCT, not the Amazon services.

Also, since I have read all the books that this show is based on and loved them so much I hoped so much that the show would try to stay close to the real story.For the first three seasons I wasn't too upset by the changes but this fourth season it was just pure rubbish. I wish I knew why the producers and writers of the show just decided to destroy such a wonderful story but they did. They took probably the most fantastic story element and character and just threw them away. Not only that, they purposely killed off the one of the best characters (and most beloved characters in the book) in such a way that they were giving the finger to all the people who loved her. Besides being brutal and sad it was so unnecessarily mean spirited. That's what angers me. Fine you don't like her concept then why use her at all? Why create her just to hurt those who lover her? I know the writers went out of their way to hurt the people who loved this part of the story. I hope that Harris didn't approve of this, in fact I hope she doesn't help them any more.I have hundreds of films in my collection and for the first time when I watched the last episode of a something I went right over to the rubbish bin and threw not only the forth season away but the whole series and I cancelled my HBO subscription which I only had to watch True Blood.I am so saddened that they ruined such a great story. I don't know why they did it but my feeling is that the writers wanted things that were dark and mean and terrible instead of bringing so beautiful goodness to the world.

It all started out kind of interesting but after the first couple of episodes, it became apparent that this once beloved show was crashing faster than today's stock market.  Do these writers talk to each other?  Do they know how to connect the dots?  I don't think so.  Just because they made almost everyone on the show a ""supe"" doesn't mean its Mmmm Mmmm good.

This fact can generate viewers who want more (denial of completion creates desire), but is a powerful reason new viewers will not come on line with so many back stories that need to be known.  A cult series, then, risks a dwindling viewer base as old favorites are pushed out and the new receive little air time each.  A typical problem for a hit long-runing series, like LAW AND ORDER, is how to evolve, keep viewer interest, and maintain the bite (or the original lure) that viewers liked early on.One can observe Alan Ball's hand or lack of it which, when he has direct creative credit for an episode, puts snap and wit into what are becoming mundane plots and characters.  Without real thoughtful development, the series loses (and has lost, to a degree) the larger issues which made it so much fun and intellectually interesting--such as ""what is it like to live forever?"" ""how does a dangerous under class treat vanillia folks?""  and, overall, ""what is it really like to be 'different'?""  Along that line, is the question to Sookie ""What are you?"" and, conversely, the lack of real probing about ""what is it like to be a shifter?""  These are interesting issues of personal identity that are being drained from a show that thinks it must be more and more--and only-- sensationalWhere, in the latter episodes, are bits like a slow pair of pans over a photo on the back wall of the Fang bar of George Bush ready to bite Lady Liberty's neck?

The moment Sookie hooked up with Eric, everything just went downhill from there.  This season revolved around witches and ghosts but none of the villains were interesting.  Bill became King Bill of all vampires in Bon Temp, Louisiana, which isnt really a good thing because his character became boring.  I am shocked to see how this season is filled with a lot of bad acting.  Maybe there were just too many possessions going on so acting became more of a challenge for some.  For example, when Antonia took possession of Marne, Marne did show a change in personality (she became more confident) but she acted nothing like Antonia.  It was just Marne high on drugs.  And then later when Marne took possession of Lafayette, he acted nothing like Marne.  Is the director/Alan Ball to be blamed? These actors should have spent more time studying each other's behaviors and movements before the real take. This is the first season of True Blood that did not leave me wanting more after it ended...even the season's cliffhanger was uninteresting and did not make me want to look forward to season 5. By the way, the actor who plays Lafayette is a really bad actor (he used to be soooo good back in season 1). He was wooden throughout this season; where's the emotion and bitchiness we all came to love from Lafayette?

1363620,A1CK4J7YRAUQ53,B003UD7J6W,"David Foughty ""DLF""","[0, 1]","I ummed and erred about whether to give this 4 or 5 stars, and plumped for 5 given how much I enjoyed the finale.This season definitely has its ups and downs. As previous reviewers noted, the fairy / faerie / whatever stuff is pretty cringeworthy, although luckily there's not that much of it. More off-putting for me was the whole werepanther bit. Seriously over Hotshot, but at least that doesn't last all season either. Since the second season (and especially in the third season) True Blood has struggled to find compelling storylines for all its many characters simultaneously, and this becomes most apparent in S4. Much as I liked Arlene and Terry, and their demon baby story is kinda fun in a campy sort of way, there's a bit too much of them by the end, and the amount of time dedicated to less interesting characters (Andy Bellfleur, anyone?) just serves to detract from the overall pace of the show. And once again Tara spends the second half of the season aimlessly wandering about in other people's plotlines, which is a damn shame.ANYWAY, on to the positives. There are some good storylines this year, principally Eric's amnesia and relationship with Sookie. Plus Bill has a new position of authority, and an accompanying personality change and businessman-like hairdo. Jess and Hoyt's relationship also gets plenty of screentime, and Pam gets some fabulous lines. Jesus and Lafayette also feature heavily, which is always a good thing. Fiona Shaw is a delight, although her Marnie isn't half the baddie Russell Edgington was, and I will admit I was hoping he might make an appearance this season (though sadly not).The first half of the season is a bit hit and miss, and I'd probably only give it 3 stars. I actually stopped watching about half-way through and only resumed several months later. The last half of the season, however, is 4 approaching 5 stars, with the finale in particular setting up a LOT of exciting potential plot threads for the next season. Plus Christopher Meloni is set to star next season, which can only be a good thing.

However, this season was a major snooze. I kept thinking, &#34;Do something witchy, Marnie!!&#34; Alas, it was mostly a pseudo history lesson and some displays of regular energy powers befitting novice practitioners. Sookie has more power. And speaking of, I couldn't be more tired of Ms. Stackhouse's open-mouthed crying. Luckily, she's easy to fast-forward through. Woo, DVD! Still, it was fun for Eric to have amnesia; he was a sweetheart, a really tall blond boychild. So innocent. So adorable. So not him. I was glad when he regained his sexiness, swagger, and sense of humor. I'd been waiting for Sookie and Eric to get it on.

1363652,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B003UD7J6W,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[11, 14]","Okay. While this series has a few too many ""WTF?!?!"" moments (this season in particular), I do love TRUE BLOOD. I love just about everyone in it, although Anna Paquin (aka The Perpetually-On-The-Verge-Of-Tears Actress) does bother me at times. I love their guest stars. In this season, Fiona Shaw is marvelous. I love the characters, although the main characters of Sookie and Bill seem to change motivations and emotions on a dime and it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense when that happens. However, characters like Jason, Hoyt, Andy, Terry, Arlene, Lafayette, Jesus, Pam, Nan, and Eric really work well, even if they get stuck in sub-plots that seem to involve several characters but only affect one.I also am really bugged by TRUE BLOOD. The character of Alcide seems to exist merely to have some additional beefcake on the show. He's a Maguffin and not a real fleshed-out character. Sam, who I loved in the first season, is becoming increasingly insufferable. His whole relationship with Tommy and Luna was an unwelcome distraction during this season. I like Sam Trammell a lot as an actor, but his whole arc this season was frustrating and it felt cheap. I'm also not terribly thrilled with Tara either. I was much more interested to follow her adventures in New Orleans with Naomi cage-fighting and maybe confronting something there that forced her to come back other than staying in a place she so obviously shouldn't be in for any reason other than seeing Sookie again. Also, her whole character arc is too interesting to be wasted as something of a hostage, both literally and figuratively. Tommy is another character that I was consistently upset with, mostly because I hate any character that exists merely as a plot device but has been built up as something more important, and his was to screw up the lives around him and gain a power that will allow a ""major"" plot point to happen.The only character that I think has a truly unique and powerful arc is Jessica. She's really the only character that doesn't have a prescribed set of baggage and rules that automatically come with her, and Deborah Ann Woll is enough of an actress to keep me tuning in. This season sees another big set of changes to her and it's really stunning watching her character grow.But this season is really about Marnie and Antonia and how a quest for power and a quest for vengeance collide and create a union powerful enough to threaten all of Louisiana's, and possibly the world's vampires. As Nan Flanagan and the newly-anointed King of Louisiana Bill Compton confront Westboro Baptist Church types (holding up signs reading ""God Hates Fangs"", which I thought was rather clever) along with persistent national media also look to continue, with support from Eric, to help vamps come ""out of the coffin"". Meanwhile, Sookie, whisked off to the outlands of The Fae at the end of the previous season, escapes (from a threat that doesn't seem, at first, to have any bearing on the season at all) with her grandaddy, played VERY briefly by the wonderful Gary Cole, after only being in the Fae dimension for only a few minutes to discover that she's been gone for over a year with everyone thinking her dead, her house sold to a new owner, and she's still neck-deep in trouble. Well, almost everyone thought she was dead. The only one that didn't give up hope was Eric, who is actually her new landlord. Things are kind of the normal state of generally F'd up in Bon Temps with ""V"" addict Sheriff Andy, Arlene thinking her son is possessed by Rene, and The MoonGoddess Emporium is causing a whole lot of chatter in the undead community as it's discovered that the proprietor and professional door-mat Marnie (Fiona Shaw) has very limited necromancer abilities. This forces a visit by Eric, by order of King Bill, to scare the pants off of Marnie... and that is naturally when everything starts to really go off-the-charts crazy.Now I realize that this is essentially an adult soap opera. It's natural for this show to go nuts. However, there are some sub-plots and elements of the main plot that are just BAD. The clunkiest sub-plot that comes to mind is the quasi-incestual relationship between Bill and his attorney when, with the help of another wonderful guest-star Katherine Helmond, he discovers she's his great-great-great-great-great granddaughter. Another resounding thud was the possession of Arlene's baby. It seemed totally unnecessary, other than to give another crisis that results in a newfound ability in one character. Another major source of confusion was Bill and his Romney-esque flip-flopping on his ""no human killing"" policy. I realize that all living things are inconsistent, but to be so extreme and waffling so often was annoying. Also Tommy. Just everything about him and everything he does. I understand he's unedjucated and that he's just a kid, but COME ON. No one is really that stupid.The main source of entertainment for this season, though, came from the unlikely relationship between Sookie and Eric after Eric's initial confrontation with Marnie/Antonia. And this leads to tension, frustration, gentleness, beauty, humor and LOTS of hot sex.As I watched this season, I was reminded of two other TV shows: BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (the set for MoonGoddess Emporium looks like it was stolen from the magic shop set of BTVS; the love triangle between a dark, brooding vampire and a flamboyant blonde vampire; the bisexuality of the best friend... I could go on) and AMERICAN HORROR STORY. I know that last one sounds strange, but stay with me: AHS is a show that I know in my heart isn't that great, but it's addictive as heck. This season of TRUE BLOOD was very similar in that regard. I know it's been better and this season could have been a lot better, but there's just something about this show that keeps me coming back.",4,"Addictive like ""V"" and about as good for

1363660,A1X1CEGHTHMBL1,B003UD7J6W,jjceo,"[0, 0]","My wife and I are real True Blood fans and we have read all of the Sookie Stackhouse books by Charlaine Harris and watched all the previous seasons.  This season four had some very good high spots in it and we loved that part but there were also several side and sub plots that just detracted from the storyline.The great parts for us:* Bill as the King of Louisiana and the way he wields power is a character with confidence and he uses it to his advantage.  It was a great season for him!* Jessica is just the hottest vampire going and she steals parts of the show with her triangle love affair with Jason and Hoyt.* The witch coven is one of the most interesting and powerful enemies that the vampires have had.  It made for some great interaction and battles with the vampires and it was fun to watch.* Eric losing his memory and for once being a nice guy with Sookie was kind of fun to watch.* I just love the character of Tara and she did a great job in this season when she returned to Bon Temps.* Sookie's efforts to help Eric and save the vampires were very good.  I love the relationship she and Eric developed.  I am so glad they quit the fairy portion right after the first episode.  I don't think I could have taken much of that.* I thought Alcide played a good role with the issues of Debbie Pelt.  Joining the new pack and the problems that ensued will make a great role for him in season 5.* The head witch Marnie and how the absolute power gained by joining with Antonia changes her from a wimpy personality into an autocratic evil villain was just the right tone for the series.Cons:* I thought the little trip to fairy land was silly and just poorly done.  Sookie's  grandfather has been gone for decades and he thinks he has just gotten there and then Sookie is there for 5 minutes and she has really be gone a year?  Beautiful fairies turned into almost demon looking creatures, I just didn't like this part of the season and I am glad it ended early.* The interaction and the overall behavior of Sam's brother Tommy was just too much.  The cruel and obnoxious things he did to Sam were just over the top and done to just get ratings but to me some of it detracted from the show.* Andy Bellefleur hooked on V and just acting like a total nut just did not add to the storyline.  It was just trying to create a role for him where one didn't exist in the script.  He could have played the tough sheriff  trying to save the town.* The portion of the possession of the young baby of Arlene didn't really add that much to the story and it was more of a distraction.  The series could have built up Sam's or Alcide's role and made the plot stronger for those key characters.Don't get me wrong we still love this HBO series and we are waiting with impatiently for the next season to be released on DVD.  This season was a 4 star but it could have easily been a 5 star with just a little more action and less verbiage.  Let's face it, for example, Sam is a bad ass shape shifter and it seems that he just lets himself get pushed around.  He turns into a bunny rabbit and a horse but fights bare knuckled against a werewolf?  His role should be stronger and in a more leading position in the town of Bon Temps and in the series.Many aspects of the HBO series are getting out of line with the books of Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse series and frankly the books have some great parts that are being eliminated.  This season might have been stronger if they had just followed the books a little more closely.The end of the season was a strong 5 stars but the start was a little weak and per my comments some improvements would have made the entire season a blockbuster.",4,The good and bad about True Blood Season 4 !,1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,3683,"['wife', 'are', 'real', 'True', 'Blood', 'fans', 'have', 'read', 'Sookie', 'Stackhouse', 'books', 'Charlaine', 'Harris', 'watched', 'previous', 'seasons', 'season', 'four', 'had', 'very', 'good', 'high', 'spots', 'loved', 'part', 'were', 'also', 'several', 'side', 'sub', 'plots', 'just', 'detracted', 'storyline.The', 'great', 'parts', '*', 'Bill', 'King', 'Louisiana', 'way', 'power', 'character', 'confidence', 'advantage', 'was', 'great', 'season', '*', 'Jessica', 'just', 'hottest', 'vampire', 'going', 'parts', 'show', 'triangle', 'love', 'affair', 'Jason', 'Hoyt', '*', 'witch', 'coven', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'powerful', 'enemies', 'vampires', 'have', 'had', 'made', 'great', 'interaction', 'battles', 'vampires', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', '*', 'Eric', 'losing', 'memory', 'once', 'being', 'nice', 'guy', 'Sookie', 'was', 'kind', 'fun', 'watch', '*', 'just', 'love', 'character', 'Tara', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'season', 'when', 'returned', 'Bon', 'Temps', '*', 'Sookie', 'efforts', 'help', 'Eric', 'save', 'vampires', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'love', 'relationship', 'Eric', 'developed', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'quit', 'fairy', 'portion', 'right', 'first', 'episode', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'much', '*', 'thought', 'Alcide', 'played', 'good', 'role', 'issues', 'Debbie', 'Pelt', 'Joining', 'new', 'pack', 'problems', 'ensued', 'will', 'make', 'great', 'role', 'season', '5', '*', 'head', 'witch', 'Marnie', 'how', 'absolute', 'power', 'gained', 'joining', 'Antonia', 'changes', 'wimpy', 'personality', 'autocratic', 'evil', 'villain', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'tone', 'series.Cons', '*', 'thought', 'little', 'trip', 'fairy', 'land', 'was', 'silly', 'just', 'poorly', 'done', 'Sookie', 'grandfather', 'been', 'gone', 'decades', 'just', 'gotten', 'there', 'then', 'Sookie', 'there', '5', 'minutes', 'really', 'be', 'gone', 'year', 'Beautiful', 'fairies', 'turned', 'almost', 'demon', 'looking', 'creatures', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'part', 'season', 'am', 'glad', 'ended', 'early', '*', 'interaction', 'overall', 'behavior', 'Sam', 'brother', 'Tommy', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'cruel', 'obnoxious', 'things', 'did', 'Sam', 'were', 'just', 'top', 'done', 'just', 'get', 'ratings', 'detracted', 'show', '*', 'Andy', 'Bellefleur', 'hooked', 'V', 'just', 'acting', 'total', 'nut', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'add', 'storyline', 'was', 'just', 'trying', 'create', 'role', 'where', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'tough', 'sheriff', 'trying', 'save', 'town', '*', 'portion', 'possession', 'young', 'baby', 'Arlene', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'that', 'much', 'story', 'was', 'more', 'distraction', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'built', 'up', 'Sam', 'Alcide', 'role', 'made', 'plot', 'stronger', 'key', 'characters.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'still', 'love', 'HBO', 'series', 'are', 'waiting', 'impatiently', 'next', 'season', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'season', 'was', '4', 'star', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', '5', 'star', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'action', 'less', 'verbiage', 'Let', 'face', 'example', 'Sam', 'bad', 'ass', 'shape', 'shifter', 'just', 'get', 'pushed', 'around', 'bunny', 'rabbit', 'horse', 'fights', 'bare', 'knuckled', 'werewolf', 'role', 'should', 'be', 'stronger', 'more', 'leading', 'position', 'town', 'Bon', 'Temps', 'series.Many', 'aspects', 'HBO', 'series', 'are', 'getting', 'line', 'books', 'Charlaine', 'Harris', 'Sookie', 'Stackhouse', 'series', 'frankly', 'books', 'have', 'great', 'parts', 'are', 'being', 'eliminated', 'season', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'stronger', 'had', 'just', 'followed', 'books', 'little', 'more', 'closely.The', 'end', 'season', 'was', 'strong', '5', 'stars', 'start', 'was', 'little', 'weak', 'comments', 'improvements', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'entire', 'season', 'blockbuster']",N/A

1363669,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B003UD7J6W,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[0, 0]","This season continues the slow trend away from the books which inspired the show, with predictably confusing results. I go in one moment from pumping my fist after seeing the most awesome thing ever on TV, to palming my face and thinking, ""holy moley, what garbage did I just see?"" And it's all, I suspect, because the show runners no longer know what show they're trying to create.Sometimes they're trying to create some sort of supernatural action-adventure extravaganza, and they come close. The conflict between a reincarnated necromancer and the vampires she still resents makes for some exciting skin-of-the-teeth encounters. As the increasingly well realized Vampire Authority steps in, trying to create some semblance of governance, the two sides increasingly reveal remarkable savagery.Sometimes they seem interested in soap-operatic romantic encounters. Not only does this continue with the Sookie-Bill-Eric triangle, which gets increasingly homoerotic as the season goes on, but other relationships, too. Sam Merlotte finally finds another shifter to love. The camera gets good mileage out of Tara's fumbling attempts at lesbianism, which seem more comical than I think the show runners intended.Sometimes they try to split the difference, most notably in the effort to come up with something for Lafayette Reynolds to do. The character dies early in the books, but proved such a fan favorite that the producers kept him alive and active. But to give him a purpose, they not only give him a fairly stereotypical interracial gay romance, they give him supernatural powers never before hinted at, which confuse as much as they entertain.As the show matures, it moves away from its former adolescent fascination with naked bodies and graphic sex. We know more about the characters, and they know more about themselves, so like a teenager moving past that first awkward groping and into a real relationship, the show gives us deeper insights into its soul. And what we see is both more profound, and more complicated, than we ever realized.I have my problems with this season, some of which are pretty big. But on the whole, I think they've done a strong job, and will continue watching. These characters have a lot of steel in their spines, and the stories continue to shine light on new and undiscovered corners of their spirits. For that, I can overlook a few plot holes and moments of overblown melodrama.",4,Flawed but Exciting Show,1343692800,"07 31, 2012",2012,2416,"['season', 'slow', 'trend', 'away', 'books', 'inspired', 'show', 'predictably', 'confusing', 'results', 'go', 'one', 'moment', 'pumping', 'fist', 'seeing', 'most', 'awesome', 'thing', 'ever', 'TV', 'palming', 'face', 'thinking', 'holy', 'moley', 'what', 'garbage', 'did', 'just', 'see', 'suspect', 'show', 'no', 'longer', 'know', 'what', 'show', ""'re"", 'trying', 'create.Sometimes', ""'re"", 'trying', 'create', 'sort', 'supernatural', 'action-adventure', 'extravaganza', 'come', 'close', 'conflict', 'reincarnated', 'necromancer', 'vampires', 'still', 'exciting', 'skin-of-the-teeth', 'encounters', 'increasingly', 'well', 'realized', 'Vampire', 'Authority', 'steps', 'trying', 'create', 'semblance', 'governance', 'two', 'sides', 'increasingly', 'reveal', 'remarkable', 'savagery.Sometimes', 'seem', 'interested', 'soap-operatic', 'romantic', 'encounters', 'Not', 'only', 'continue', 'Sookie-Bill-Eric', 'triangle', 'increasingly', 'homoerotic', 'season', 'other', 'relationships', 'too', 'Sam', 'Merlotte', 'finally', 'shifter', 'love', 'camera', 'good', 'mileage', 'Tara', 'fumbling', 'attempts', 'lesbianism', 'seem', 'more', 'comical', 'think', 'show', 'intended.Sometimes', 'try', 'split', 'difference', 'most', 'notably', 'effort', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'Lafayette', 'Reynolds', 'do', 'character', 'early', 'books', 'proved', 'fan', 'favorite', 'producers', 'kept', 'alive', 'active', 'give', 'purpose', 'not', 'only', 'give', 'fairly', 'stereotypical', 'interracial', 'gay', 'romance', 'give', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'never', 'before', 'hinted', 'confuse', 'as', 'much', 'entertain.As', 'show', 'away', 'former', 'adolescent', 'fascination', 'naked', 'bodies', 'graphic', 'sex', 'know', 'more', 'characters', 'know', 'more', 'so', 'teenager', 'moving', 'first', 'awkward', 'groping', 'real', 'relationship', 'show', 'deeper', 'insights', 'soul', 'what', 'see', 'more', 'profound', 'more', 'complicated', 'ever', 'realized.I', 'have', 'problems', 'season', 'are', 'pretty', 'big', 'whole', 'think', ""'ve"", 'done', 'strong', 'job', 'will', 'continue', 'watching', 'characters', 'have', 'lot', 'steel', 'spines', 'stories', 'continue', 'shine', 'light', 'new', 'undiscovered', 'corners', 'spirits', 'can', 'overlook', 'few', 'plot', 'holes', 'moments', 'overblown', 'melodrama']",N/A

Considering that the fourth Sookie Stackhouse book is also my favorite, I was worried that the show wouldn't live up to the book. And while it's not quite as good (shows/movies based on books rarely are as good as the original) I thought it was creative and unique.This show is really one that has entertainment value. It's so completely crazy and yet it works. Sure there were parts I wasn't too into (SPOILERS!) Lafayatte being a medium was one (though I did enjoy the witchcraft) and the evil baby story line was just weird.

The Jason plot thread from the third season, which had been a serious thread, got turned into kind of a big joke, and was resolved.Where the second and third season was all about introducing all kinds of new creatures of different types, the fourth season had about six to eight plot threads mixing them all up and - when all was said and done - they seem to have dumped most of them out.They re-invented Eric, and then - in a flash of brilliance, I thought - gave us a new look at everything we thought knew about Eric.With all of the plot threads flying around madly, it was amazingly satisfying to see them all get resolved in a season finale - that turned out not to be the season finale after all: it was the second to last episode.Which leads me to my only real complaint about the season: the final episode of the season.  It was a mess, even a rehash in some ways of the previous episode.  It brought back some very old characters for a new season.  And a one important developing plot thread from season three and four is clearly the subject for the next season.Yeah, it's really hard to review this series without spoilers.Overall, at times I was cheering, but I got kind of annoyed at the very end.

When we last left Sookie she was upset by learning that Bill used her and decided to join her Fairy brethren in ""Fairyland.""  Sookie is not there too long and finds it is no all she thought it to be.  She has to make a daring escape to return to Bon Temps.Sookie discovers that though she was away only a few hours, more than a year has passed in the ""real"" world.  In fact, everyone thought Bill had killed her.  A lot has changed.  Sookie's house has been sold to a mysterious corporation, Bill is now the King of Louisianna, Andy is addicted to V, Jason is a full-fledged deputy, Sam has taken up with a group of Shape Shifters, Tara is living with a girlfriend in New Orleans, and Lafayette has been introduced to a coven of witches (he also has a new sleek do).A lot happens in those first two episodes including Floyd and Jessica having their differences, learning that the new baby may be the second coming of Damian from ""The Omen"" and the secret vampire society is trying their hardest help vampires be accepted as normal citizens.  Then we have Sheriff Eric who has new plans for Sookie.  Only two episodes in and Eric is grudgingly accepting orders from King Bill and later is sent on a mission where he meets his match from something that seems to have changed him drastically.  Lastly, the Panther clan have some secret plans for Jason.I cannot wait for next week and I am lucky to suscribe to a cable service that has early premieres for the show so I am getting the new episodes a week early.

The subplots of Andy's V addiction and the were-panther were more distracting than compelling, as was the demon-baby storyline.  The main witch plot had some gripping moments and resulted in some surprising moments.  Beware--there are a lot of deaths this season and several regulars are eliminated.Anna Paquin is excellent as always as the beleagured Sookie; Alexander Skarsgard's transformation is convincing; Jim Parrack is strong as Hoyt; Fiona Shaw handles her duel persona devilishly well and Kevin Alejandro has a strong season as Jesus.

Nookie returns to Bob Temps after a year (even though she was away for only a few minutes in Fairlie Land) to find Bill as the new King of Louisiana and that her brother and friends had given up on her.

Cookie starts a romance with Eric who has amnesia due to a spell cast by Antonia / Marnie. The witch Antonia eventually realizes the wrongdoing she's caused to innocent people and decides to stop. Yet Marnie, addicted to Antonia's power, binds her against her will to acquire her powers. Subplots include Fayette's introduction to the world of magic and his abilities as a medium, Spam's family troubles, Ideal and Debbie's troubled relationship, and Mason, Yoyt and Jossica's love triangle.

1363709,A2PJSHMB83QYKX,B003UD7J6W,MoVwatcher20,"[25, 31]","Having just watched the first episode of season 4, I, after lying in the fetal position for a good thirty minutes, decided to communicate my feelings of embarassment and utter sadness at what this show has become in a healthy and cathartic way. Let me just say, I struggled through the latter half of season 2 and the whole of season 3, because while I knew what I was watching was looming closer and closer to soap opera mediocrity with every episode, I still had hope, however slim, that maybe I would finally be reunited with the show I knew and loved if I just kept with it. So, I mustered strength I didn't know I had in me and continued to watch. Now, it DID get exceptionally difficult to keep going after watching a scene with Anna Paquin, in one of the poorest acting jobs I have seen to date, scream like a moron while surrounded by a circle of laughably-artificial fire, especially since I like Anna Paquin, having loved her in season one and the beginning of season 2, and as a film actress, I think she is one of the more competent-but my GOD! I was not expecting that at all, regardless of how rediculous the writing had become at that point. This show has taken a 90 degree plunge following the latter half of season 2, for a number of reasons:1. The dialogue has become so bad, it's actually becoming hilarious2. Characters who they make a big fuss setting up a plot for are killed off for no reason, other than it's obvious the writers are realizing they shouldn't have introduced them in the first place and just can't think of anything else to do with them.3. The personal connections between characters (e.g Sookie and Tara) are almost nonexistent now, and none of the characters feel real or even likeable in comparison to how they originally started out.4. Characters are being treated more like Sims, for the writers to just manipulate and see to what rediculous extent they can push them- Tara being a vamp (cheap); Sookie going to play in Fairie world; Jason hooking up with a werepanther( really?) who becomes crazy and then never referenced AGAIN?!5. Too many stories that have no connection with each other and have no interesting substance, whatsoever.6. The use of slow-motion and cheesy one-liners that just go to show how low the creators are willing to stoop to get viewers,And the list goes on and on...This is becoming one of those shows that I watch if I'm in a bad mood and need a cheap laugh (and believe me, this is laughable), which actually makes me sad because of how much I loved season 1. The story was straightforward and all of the little subplots tied together, the characters felt realistic and likeable, the dialogue was smart, funny but never corny, and above all else, every episode was memorable and not just there to set up a bunch of cliff hangers for the next episode to answer. Having gone back and watched the season for the first time since it premiered on TV, I look at the characters and how completely unrecognizable they seem. Remember when Sookie acted a little bit the intelligent and balsy woman instead of the useless nuisance who just screams like a baby when she gets in trouble? Remember how Sam and Tara had a fling or that he was completely in love with Sookie? Or when Lafayette was the funny, slightly flamboyant clown? Remember when Bill was sexy and mysterious and when Eric had that bangin' Kurt Cobain hairdo and that evil streak we couldn't help but dig? I admit, with the slow but steady descent these characters have been on since, it took me awhile to remember, and now that I do, I want to see THEIR show, instead of this fairytale vomit that has taken its place.",1,Makes Me Mourn for Season 1,1343174400,"07 25, 2012",2012,3645,"['Having', 'just', 'watched', 'first', 'episode', 'season', '4', 'lying', 'fetal', 'position', 'good', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'decided', 'communicate', 'feelings', 'embarassment', 'utter', 'sadness', 'what', 'show', 'become', 'healthy', 'cathartic', 'way', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'struggled', 'latter', 'half', 'season', '2', 'whole', 'season', '3', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'watching', 'was', 'looming', 'closer', 'closer', 'soap', 'opera', 'mediocrity', 'episode', 'still', 'had', 'hope', 'however', 'slim', 'maybe', 'would', 'finally', 'be', 'reunited', 'show', 'knew', 'loved', 'just', 'kept', 'So', 'mustered', 'strength', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'continued', 'watch', 'Now', 'DID', 'get', 'exceptionally', 'difficult', 'keep', 'going', 'watching', 'scene', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'one', 'poorest', 'acting', 'jobs', 'have', 'seen', 'date', 'scream', 'moron', 'surrounded', 'circle', 'laughably-artificial', 'fire', 'especially', 'like', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'having', 'loved', 'season', 'one', 'beginning', 'season', '2', 'film', 'actress', 'think', 'one', 'more', 'competent-but', 'GOD', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'regardless', 'how', 'rediculous', 'writing', 'had', 'become', 'point', 'show', 'taken', '90', 'degree', 'plunge', 'following', 'latter', 'half', 'season', '2', 'number', 'reasons:1', 'dialogue', 'become', 'so', 'bad', 'actually', 'becoming', 'hilarious2', 'Characters', 'who', 'make', 'big', 'fuss', 'setting', 'up', 'plot', 'are', 'killed', 'off', 'reason', 'other', 'obvious', 'writers', 'are', 'realizing', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'introduced', 'first', 'place', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'else', 'do', 'them.3', 'personal', 'connections', 'characters', 'e.g', 'Sookie', 'Tara', 'are', 'almost', 'nonexistent', 'now', 'none', 'characters', 'feel', 'real', 'even', 'likeable', 'comparison', 'how', 'originally', 'started', 'out.4', 'Characters', 'are', 'being', 'treated', 'more', 'Sims', 'writers', 'just', 'manipulate', 'see', 'what', 'rediculous', 'extent', 'can', 'push', 'them-', 'Tara', 'being', 'vamp', 'cheap', 'Sookie', 'going', 'play', 'Fairie', 'world', 'Jason', 'hooking', 'up', 'werepanther', 'really', 'who', 'crazy', 'then', 'never', 'referenced', 'AGAIN', '5', 'Too', 'many', 'stories', 'have', 'connection', 'other', 'have', 'interesting', 'substance', 'whatsoever.6', 'use', 'slow-motion', 'cheesy', 'one-liners', 'just', 'go', 'show', 'how', 'low', 'creators', 'are', 'willing', 'stoop', 'get', 'viewers', 'list', 'becoming', 'one', 'shows', 'watch', ""'m"", 'bad', 'mood', 'need', 'cheap', 'laugh', 'believe', 'laughable', 'actually', 'sad', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'season', '1', 'story', 'was', 'straightforward', 'little', 'subplots', 'tied', 'together', 'characters', 'felt', 'realistic', 'likeable', 'dialogue', 'was', 'smart', 'funny', 'never', 'corny', 'else', 'episode', 'was', 'memorable', 'not', 'just', 'there', 'set', 'up', 'bunch', 'cliff', 'hangers', 'next', 'episode', 'answer', 'Having', 'gone', 'back', 'watched', 'season', 'first', 'time', 'premiered', 'TV', 'look', 'characters', 'how', 'completely', 'unrecognizable', 'seem', 'Remember', 'when', 'Sookie', 'acted', 'little', 'bit', 'intelligent', 'balsy', 'woman', 'instead', 'useless', 'nuisance', 'who', 'just', 'screams', 'baby', 'when', 'trouble', 'Remember', 'how', 'Sam', 'Tara', 'had', 'fling', 'was', 'completely', 'love', 'Sookie', 'when', 'Lafayette', 'was', 'funny', 'slightly', 'flamboyant', 'clown', 'Remember', 'when', 'Bill', 'was', 'sexy', 'mysterious', 'when', 'Eric', 'had', 'bangin', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'hairdo', 'evil', 'streak', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'dig', 'admit', 'slow', 'steady', 'descent', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'took', 'remember', 'now', 'do', 'want', 'see', 'THEIR', 'show', 'instead', 'fairytale', 'vomit', 'taken', 'place']",N/A

1363712,A3I026QO4V5ADY,B003UD7J6W,night book owl,"[40, 79]","I really enjoyed the first 2 seasons of this series. The 3rd one was so-so, the 4th one is truly terrible and a complete departure from the popular books. I read all the books, great light entertaining vacation reads and what I liked is that the author approached the rather weird subject with a lot of humor - with other words - ""don't take it too seriously"".HBO in this last season went for blood, gore, ripping body parts out of people, not to mention sex, sex and more sex seemingly just for shock value and left the humor and actual contents of the novel far behind. I don't mind sex and some violence at all if it adhers to the subject matter (the books), but enough is enough. In my humble opinion - this season is a mess from start to finish.Sookie, the main character almost gets lost in the tale of a wicked witches coven, oh yes, and the boss witch is possessed by a long dead and burned witch out for revenge, which she inhales and spits out at regular intervals between killings, burning vampires and holding people hostage via a force field -to the best of my recollection, none of this nonsense was in the books. As a matter of fact the witches in the books were rather benign, living with Sookie as friends and the worse they ever did was to turn a guy into a cat (which was rather funny).

I liked Eric as an amnesiac, and his relationship with Sookie (till he regained his memory).  That's about it.The other storylines rambled.  Numerous plot threads (such as Tara's career as a fighter, and a shapeshifter's impersonation of a human character's son) seemed initially interesting,  but fizzled midway through the season without connecting with the overall (muddled, rambling) story arc.  The writing was uneven, and made little sense.  The dialogue, which sparkled in the first two seasons, was frankly bad and hard to listen to, reminiscent of many poorly written sci fi channel series, in Season 4.

Well come on down to Bon Temps, Louisiana, y'all! You're bound to become a werewolf, witch, medium, witch doctor, ghost, shapeshifter, fairy, demon, demon baby or...hmmm what am I missing? Ah, vampire of course! That's right...by Season 4 of True Blood everyone's a monster or have partnered up with a monster or have drank monster blood or have been involved with a monster in some way, shape or form.Season 4 begins a year after the finale of Season 3, and Bill Compton played by wooden actor Stephen Moyer has been named King Vampire of Monsterland in mostly unseen events. Sookie is gaining control of her fairy powers. A coven of witches creates chaos for the local vamps, especially Eric. Jugheaded Jason is a full-fledged sheriff's deputy and in danger of becoming a werepanther (LoL). And Sam has to deal with his brother who has gained an upper-handed shapeshifting power.While the notion of the national (global?) rise of the monsters is really kinda of silly, as I'm tongue in cheek deliberately trying to make it sound above, I have to say that I can't resist this show. I'm completely hooked in. True Blood has ""truly"" glamoured me. It's very well produced and has some very cool special effects. While many of the plot lines are really hard to swallow this season and contain various inconsistencies (like why is it the vamps only have to be invited into an establishment in some cases and can barge right into others at will?), the stories and side stories are mostly fun and exciting to watch.And I will be hooked in again in the summer of 2012 when Season 5 returns. As usual, Season 4 ended with cliffhangers for all of the main characters (and the actual or suggested return of past characters) that have you jonesing for more True Blood like a bad V addiction.

I loved the first season, hated the second, extremely adored the third (it is their best in my opinion) and now there's season four, which is by far the worst.SOME SPOILERS INCLUDED!!!Now the thing I disliked the most about the season was the plotlines, they were extremely weak. As usual there were many plot lines going on for each character, and I just found myself, not caring about any of them.1. Bill/Sookie/Eric love triangle.  The season starts off with Sookie in the magical realm she was transported to at the end of the previous season, this turns out to be the land of fairies, and Sookie herself, is a fairy. Now the fairies don't like vampires because due to the extremely tasty nature of fairy blood, vampires almost wiped them out in the past. So the queen fairy, asks Sookie to stay there, with her own people. However her deceased grandfather is also there, and tells her that those she loves in the human realm could be in danger and the fairies are liars. So she escapes, barely. She then realizes she has been gone of a year in the real world, while it's only been a few hours in the fairy world, and boy are things different! Tara's now living a quasi lesbian life with her new girl friend while cage fighting on the side, Andy Belfleur is addicted to V, and Bill is the new king of Louisiana, working with Eric to boost the vampire's image after the previous season's events. Now I actually liked this episode, but the rest just bring the season down.Eric at some point in time looses his memory, an falls in love with Sookie after she takes care of him, eventually she feels the same for him, and soon they have the sex. It's the WAY Eric acts however that I don't like, he is the opposite of himself, a whipped, love sick puppy who follows Sookie around like she's his den mother, he's lost all respect i've had for him, meanwhile, Bill has taken Erics ""Badass"" role by doing the tough things that need to be done as king, which Sookie opposes, hence their breakup. However he still cares for her, and she still loves him, she even greedily says how she wants both Bill and Eric, not seeing anything wrong with it (really??)Anyway, the main villain in the story is Marney, a Semi powerful witch who runs a coven of young up and coming witches and warlocks, including LaFayette, and his new boyfriend, Jesus (pronounced ""hey zeus'') Bill, sensing that the witches can be a problem with the vampires in the town (as they have in the past) orders Bill (prior to him losing his memory) to go and put a stop to their congregation.  He goes, however Marnie convinces the others at the circle to help out, and they cast a spell that wipes Bill's memory, leading to my earlier post. Now Marnie, kinda high on power channels the power of a long dead witch who has a grudge against vampires, and wants to kill them all in the town, and shennanigans ensue.We also have such tedious subplots as-Lafayette getting possessed by a dead black woman-Marlene thinking her baby is evil-Jason being kidnapped and raped by werepanthers....-And Hoyt realizing, dating someone who wants to eat you isn't all it's cracked up to be.Honestly, all of those stories felt half done, rushed and boring, while the main villain could have been easily defeated if the vampires would have put their minds to it. So without giving away the whole season, I must say, i didn't care for this, at all.",2,This season kinda sucked...pun intended.,1328313600,"02 4, 2012",2012,3451,"['Now', ""'ve"", 'had', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'HBO', 'True', 'Blood', 'series', 'loved', 'first', 'season', 'hated', 'second', 'extremely', 'adored', 'third', 'best', 'opinion', 'now', 'season', 'four', 'far', 'worst.SOME', 'SPOILERS', 'INCLUDED', 'Now', 'thing', 'disliked', 'most', 'season', 'was', 'plotlines', 'were', 'extremely', 'weak', 'usual', 'were', 'many', 'plot', 'lines', 'going', 'character', 'just', 'found', 'not', 'caring', 'them.1', 'Bill/Sookie/Eric', 'love', 'triangle', 'season', 'off', 'Sookie', 'magical', 'realm', 'was', 'transported', 'end', 'previous', 'season', 'out', 'be', 'land', 'fairies', 'Sookie', 'fairy', 'Now', 'fairies', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'vampires', 'due', 'extremely', 'tasty', 'nature', 'fairy', 'blood', 'almost', 'wiped', 'out', 'past', 'queen', 'fairy', 'Sookie', 'stay', 'there', 'own', 'people', 'However', 'deceased', 'grandfather', 'also', 'there', 'human', 'realm', 'could', 'be', 'danger', 'fairies', 'are', 'liars', 'barely', 'then', 'been', 'gone', 'year', 'real', 'world', 'only', 'been', 'few', 'hours', 'fairy', 'world', 'boy', 'are', 'things', 'different', 'Tara', 'now', 'living', 'quasi', 'lesbian', 'life', 'new', 'girl', 'friend', 'cage', 'fighting', 'side', 'Andy', 'Belfleur', 'addicted', 'V', 'Bill', 'new', 'king', 'Louisiana', 'working', 'Eric', 'boost', 'vampire', 'image', 'previous', 'season', 'events', 'Now', 'actually', 'liked', 'episode', 'rest', 'just', 'bring', 'season', 'down.Eric', 'point', 'time', 'memory', 'falls', 'love', 'Sookie', 'care', 'eventually', 'same', 'soon', 'have', 'sex', 'WAY', 'Eric', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'opposite', 'whipped', 'love', 'sick', 'puppy', 'who', 'Sookie', 'den', 'mother', 'lost', 'respect', 'i', ""'ve"", 'had', 'meanwhile', 'Bill', 'taken', 'Erics', 'Badass', 'role', 'doing', 'tough', 'things', 'need', 'be', 'done', 'king', 'Sookie', 'hence', 'breakup', 'However', 'still', 'still', 'even', 'greedily', 'how', 'Bill', 'Eric', 'not', 'seeing', 'anything', 'wrong', 'really', 'Anyway', 'main', 'villain', 'story', 'Marney', 'Semi', 'powerful', 'witch', 'who', 'coven', 'young', 'coming', 'witches', 'warlocks', 'including', 'LaFayette', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Jesus', 'pronounced', 'hey', 'zeus', 'Bill', 'sensing', 'witches', 'can', 'be', 'problem', 'vampires', 'town', 'have', 'past', 'orders', 'Bill', 'prior', 'losing', 'memory', 'go', 'put', 'stop', 'congregation', 'however', 'Marnie', 'others', 'circle', 'help', 'out', 'cast', 'spell', 'Bill', 'memory', 'leading', 'earlier', 'post', 'Now', 'Marnie', 'kinda', 'high', 'power', 'channels', 'power', 'long', 'dead', 'witch', 'who', 'grudge', 'vampires', 'kill', 'town', 'shennanigans', 'ensue.We', 'also', 'have', 'such', 'tedious', 'subplots', 'as-Lafayette', 'getting', 'possessed', 'dead', 'black', 'woman-Marlene', 'thinking', 'baby', 'evil-Jason', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'raped', 'werepanthers', '.-And', 'Hoyt', 'realizing', 'dating', 'someone', 'who', 'eat', ""n't"", 'cracked', 'up', 'be.Honestly', 'stories', 'felt', 'half', 'done', 'rushed', 'boring', 'main', 'villain', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'easily', 'defeated', 'vampires', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'minds', 'So', 'giving', 'away', 'whole', 'season', 'must', 'say', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'care']",N/A

1363770,A20V70N4GOALDI,B003UD7J6W,"Wallywood ""Wallywood""","[0, 1]","It seems most of the reviews of this season are about the show and not the Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital Copy that this season is sold in, since most of the reviews seem to have been written last year or early this year before the set even came out. The season itself I'd give five stars to, it was really good. The package the set came in, tho, only rates a four star review.The main reason for this is the DVD set included in the package. While the Blu-Ray set is well packed and protected, the DVD set is on two double sided DVDs that are just slid into a rough cardboard sleve that tends to scratch the back and half the front of the disk and leave the other half of the front of the disk exposed with no covering at all. Both of my DVD disks were scratched front and back and one had a big rough spot were it had rubbed hard against something.It does seem rather strange that the Blu-Rays, that hold far more data than a DVD does, had the shows spread out over 5 Blu-Ray disks, while the shows on the DVDs were on two double sided DVDs. Since there were only 12 shows totalling 720 minutes, that meant that each DVD side had about 180 minutes on it. Not a bad ratio if the DVDs were dual layer, but the DVDs were labeled as Standard and not Dual Layer, so that means the shows are going to be pretty well compressed to get 180 minutes on one side of a single layer DVD, so expect the quality of the DVD versions to not be very good.The Digital Copy was not even in the box, but had to be downloaded thru the internet. It did say that in the review, but that is just an extra step that shouldn't be necessary. If something is advertised as included with the product, it should actually be in the box, not stored on the web somewhere where you have to go find it and download it. And then, of course, there's all that time and bandwidth that's being used up to download all 12 episodes in a nicely vieweable format.As much as HBO charges for their shows, I would expect them to provide a decent container for the DVDs, at least a plastic slim case to hold the two DVDs. The cardboard case just looks cheap and actually damages the DVDs far more than protects them. I'd even be happy if they just put them in paper sleeves like old CDs rather than the scratchy cardboard sleeve. And since the price of blank DVDs is just a few pennies in bulk and a few more pennies to include the digital version of the shows, it certainly wouldn't hurt HBO's bottom line to include them in the case too.",4,"Great Blu-Rays, Bad DVDs",1340928000,"06 29, 2012",2012,2480,"['most', 'reviews', 'season', 'are', 'show', 'not', 'Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital', 'Copy', 'season', 'sold', 'most', 'reviews', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'last', 'year', 'early', 'year', 'set', 'even', 'came', 'out', 'season', ""'d"", 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'package', 'set', 'came', 'tho', 'only', 'rates', 'four', 'star', 'review.The', 'main', 'reason', 'DVD', 'set', 'included', 'package', 'Blu-Ray', 'set', 'well', 'packed', 'protected', 'DVD', 'set', 'two', 'double', 'sided', 'DVDs', 'are', 'just', 'slid', 'rough', 'cardboard', 'sleve', 'scratch', 'back', 'front', 'disk', 'leave', 'other', 'half', 'front', 'disk', 'exposed', 'covering', 'DVD', 'disks', 'were', 'scratched', 'front', 'back', 'one', 'had', 'big', 'rough', 'spot', 'were', 'had', 'rubbed', 'hard', 'something.It', 'seem', 'rather', 'strange', 'Blu-Rays', 'hold', 'far', 'more', 'data', 'DVD', 'had', 'shows', 'spread', '5', 'Blu-Ray', 'disks', 'shows', 'DVDs', 'were', 'two', 'double', 'sided', 'DVDs', 'were', 'only', '12', 'shows', 'totalling', '720', 'minutes', 'meant', 'DVD', 'side', 'had', '180', 'minutes', 'Not', 'bad', 'ratio', 'DVDs', 'were', 'dual', 'layer', 'DVDs', 'were', 'labeled', 'Standard', 'not', 'Dual', 'Layer', 'shows', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'pretty', 'well', 'compressed', 'get', '180', 'minutes', 'one', 'side', 'single', 'layer', 'DVD', 'so', 'expect', 'quality', 'DVD', 'versions', 'not', 'be', 'very', 'good.The', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'box', 'had', 'be', 'downloaded', 'internet', 'did', 'say', 'review', 'just', 'extra', 'step', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'necessary', 'something', 'advertised', 'included', 'product', 'should', 'actually', 'be', 'box', 'not', 'stored', 'web', 'somewhere', 'where', 'have', 'go', 'find', 'download', 'then', 'course', 'time', 'bandwidth', 'being', 'used', 'up', 'download', '12', 'episodes', 'nicely', 'vieweable', 'format.As', 'much', 'HBO', 'charges', 'shows', 'would', 'expect', 'provide', 'decent', 'container', 'DVDs', 'least', 'plastic', 'slim', 'case', 'hold', 'two', 'DVDs', 'cardboard', 'case', 'just', 'cheap', 'actually', 'damages', 'DVDs', 'far', 'more', ""'d"", 'even', 'be', 'happy', 'just', 'put', 'paper', 'sleeves', 'old', 'CDs', 'rather', 'scratchy', 'cardboard', 'sleeve', 'price', 'blank', 'DVDs', 'just', 'few', 'pennies', 'bulk', 'few', 'more', 'pennies', 'include', 'digital', 'version', 'shows', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'HBO', 'bottom', 'line', 'include', 'case', 'too']",N/A

1363775,A3I4XJW0NJROQ2,B003UD7J6W,w.s.,"[56, 60]","After the kitchen-sink approach of season three, season four of True Blood went back to basics in many ways. Maybe the writers saw the need to have more cohesive stories this year (In fact, a couple of the commentators on the season three DVDs mentioned their desire to have things be more contained writing-wise). That I feel was the major flaw of the still deliciously entertaining third season. But, season four reminded me of the first season in some ways. Things stayed in Bon Temps and everyone was much more involved with each other. I really enjoyed how everyone became intertwined again.So, the Big Bad for this season is technically two women: a timid medium named Marnie (Fiona Show) who becomes possessed with the vengeful spirit of an Inquisition-era witch Antonia (Paula Turbay). Marnie was an interesting villain; much more vulnerable and humanized than Maryann or Russell Edgington or even Rene. She was so shy and meek that she had to become possessed by a witch to find her inner Bad. For this reason, she can be considered somewhat of a weak villain. But, once Antonia enters the picture, Marnie becomes quite the bad ass. The commanding confidence she exudes from this point on demonstrates Shaw's talent as an actress, since she's basically going from one extreme to the other. Still, I found it hard to enjoy Marnie's evilness as much as I did Maryann or Russell, who were endlessly fun to watch.Now, on to the big deal of season four: Sookie and Eric finally hook up, after about a season and a half of sexual tension. I had been waiting for this day since season three and, even though Eric had to lose his bite for it to happen, I still relished every moment. Anna Paquin and Alexander Skarsgard have always had fantastic chemistry. Not as searing as her with Stephen Moyer, but still undeniably believable. I'd have to disagree wholeheartedly with the reviewer who said their sex scenes ""lacked heat"". The episode where they first make love was some of the hottest sex I've seen on the show. The build-up of tension and release was comparable to the first time Sookie and Bill had sex in season one. There's such a sweet satisfaction in just seeing it finally happen.I haven't read the books but I heard Bill gradually disappears after he and Sookie break up. The fact that the show still has Bill around made for some great tension. As much as I was annoyed with Bill in season three, he grew back on me this season. All the mixed emotions he experienced in regards to Sookie and Eric - petty jealousy, regret, wanting her to be happy, trying to focus on his duties as king instead - really humanized him. He wasn't dealing with it as a cold-blooded vampire but as a flesh-and-blood man would deal with a breakup and seeing his ex with his former nemesis. Stephen Moyer really took command of this season and his new title as King brought out an interesting new dimension of Bill.The Jason/Jessica/Hoyt love triangle was completely unexpected but I enjoyed it every minute of it, as well as the consequences it brought. As far as the other storylines, there were pros and cons. Kristin Bauer van Straten was at the top of her game as Pam, more sarcastic and biting than ever, but she didn't have much to do but stand around and complain (and rot). Tara has always been one of my favorites and I appreciated her getting her strength back this year and not crying every single episode. Her joining forces with Marnie/Antonia was a smart twist, due to her history with vampires, but it didn't seem to have a payoff. In the end, Tara obviously regretted it but we didn't learn how much it developed her character. I did really love Sam and Tommy's relationship, though. It was so troubled and turbulent but, in the end, we saw how deeply both men loved each other.The season finale was epic. So many twists and turns and surprises. In my opinion, it's the best season finale in the show's history. We've been left with so many unanswered questions and so many juicy cliffhangers.
