I was once told by a great aunt that a group of women can make a man blush and run out of the room !...The humorous performances by Christina Applegate, Cameron Diaz, Selma Blair, and the neurotic Parker Posey created awesome comedic chemistry and timing...The simple plot is about the lives of 3 young hot ladies in their late 20's, early 30's, who live in San Francisco as best friends and roommates and are having fun with life in general. But, they also encounter the ups and downs of relationships and begin to question if they are tired of playing ""the game"" referring to the dating scene as opposed to finding their Mr. Rights...Such a quest leads one of the girls to test her own faith and take that leap ! What happens in between, from the bizarre ""yellow brick road"" scene in a men's bathroom to a painful piercing incident, the sequences had me rolling ! Even the movie musical montage scenes are some of the funniest I have seen in years for any comedy...So, guys, this is not, I repeat, a feminist male bashing film, it is something I think we all need to see to get a clue as to what our girlfriends and wives do when they let loose with their buddies !

When I say inappropriate, I mean these particular scenes should be watched by absolutely *nobody*.I don't quite understand the inclusion of such inappropriateness either. It's not like the target audience here (young women) would find these kind of scenes funny. At least I'd HOPE not, because mainly only men find such crude humor effective and worth watching for some cheap laughs.So under NO circumstance should a child be watching the Sweetest Thing. I won't exactly explain these highly offensive parts of the movie, I'll just say one of them involves a woman stuck in a certain position with lots of people watching and trying to help free her, and another segment deals with a woman taking a dress to the cleaners which again deals with a young woman being forced into a situation she has no control over, or escape from.The actual romantic portion of the film is quite underwhelmingly predictable as well, so... alright, I *did* find the offensive parts hilarious, but women and children should most definitely not be viewing them.Christina Applegate is beautiful like always, but the movie needed actual substance and a less predictable storyline to really save it.

The movie which has been slammed by critics and ignored by most audiences is about a girl named Christine who's young, sexy, living in San Fransisco and has all the men falling head over heels for her. One night while out with her best friends Courtney and Jane, she meets a man named Peter while trying to set up Jane who's just been recently dumped and ends up falling for him herself. What starts out as playful bickering between the two ends up with Christine questioning if he could be the one and if she is sick of playing ""the game"". Realizing later that he could have been the one, Christine and Courtney head off on a wild and hilarious road trip to track down Peter and to see if the butterflies she felt could lead to anything more. All in all the story is quite predictable, some things will take you completely by surprise, but the gags that come along the way will most likely have you talking about it the next day. The DVD unrated version is quite good and it features the ever so infamous Penis Song and a bunch of other scenes that were too racey for movie theaters included IN the movie. Also included is an enjoyable audio commentary with the film's stars Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate and the always funny, funny Selma Blair.

An unrated version is also available, with extra footage and a different commentary track. Of course, true fans will want both.)The most interesting aspect of The Sweetest Thing is how traditionally banal it is. With all the talk about it being a gross-out sex comedy for women, at its heart it is really just a romantic comedy. It even has the requisite happy ending.Cameron Diaz is Christina Walton, to whom we are introduced by some of the many men she has kept at arm's length. At a party, she attempts to seduce a man for her friend Jane (played by Selma Blair), who has just been dumped. This man, one Peter Donahue (Thomas Jane), of course (there's little original about this film) becomes the object of Christina's affection, beginning with a heated argument of the type where you can see the emotional heat building underneath.After a little deception and a lost opportunity, Christina and her other friend, Courtney (Christina Applegate, using her body to full effect as a comic property), set out on a road trip to find this guy. But they are in for a surprise.Diaz is charming as always and Applegate excels at this sort of physical comedy, but there's something wrong with this Thing. Instead of missing something, there's too much going on. Had screenwriter Nancy Pimental decided to stick with the romantic comedy angle, we would have had nothing particularly special (except that the chemistry between Cameron Diaz and Thomas Jane may have carried it to another level), but with all the shenanigans going on (a scene in a men's public restroom; discussion over the aromatic quality of respective nether regions) there's little room for sweetness in The Sweetest Thing.Admittedly, I laughed in spite of myself (particularly at the source of the smell in the car and at Applegate's tour de force arousal of a passing biker) but once it was over, very little of it remained in my memory. The Sweetest Thing is simply a good idea gone wrong through the unnecessary addition of extraneous ""humor.""",4,"Sweet romantic comedy bogged down by rude ""humor""",1041811200,"01 6, 2003",2003,2078,"['review', 'R-rated', 'version', 'one', 'saw', 'unrated', 'version', 'also', 'available', 'extra', 'footage', 'different', 'commentary', 'track', 'course', 'true', 'fans', 'will', 'want', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'Sweetest', 'Thing', 'how', 'traditionally', 'banal', 'talk', 'being', 'gross-out', 'sex', 'comedy', 'women', 'heart', 'really', 'just', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'even', 'requisite', 'happy', 'ending.Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Christina', 'Walton', 'whom', 'are', 'introduced', 'many', 'men', 'kept', 'arm', 'length', 'party', 'seduce', 'man', 'friend', 'Jane', 'played', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'dumped', 'man', 'one', 'Peter', 'Donahue', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'course', 'little', 'original', 'film', 'object', 'Christina', 'affection', 'beginning', 'heated', 'argument', 'type', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'emotional', 'heat', 'building', 'underneath.After', 'little', 'deception', 'lost', 'opportunity', 'Christina', 'other', 'friend', 'Courtney', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'using', 'body', 'full', 'effect', 'comic', 'property', 'set', 'out', 'road', 'trip', 'find', 'guy', 'are', 'surprise.Diaz', 'charming', 'always', 'Applegate', 'excels', 'sort', 'physical', 'comedy', 'something', 'wrong', 'Thing', 'Instead', 'missing', 'something', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'Had', 'screenwriter', 'Nancy', 'Pimental', 'decided', 'stick', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'angle', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'special', 'chemistry', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'may', 'have', 'carried', 'level', 'shenanigans', 'going', 'scene', 'men', 'public', 'restroom', 'discussion', 'aromatic', 'quality', 'respective', 'nether', 'regions', 'little', 'room', 'sweetness', 'Sweetest', 'Thing.Admittedly', 'laughed', 'spite', 'particularly', 'source', 'smell', 'car', 'Applegate', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'arousal', 'passing', 'biker', 'was', 'over', 'very', 'little', 'remained', 'memory', 'Sweetest', 'Thing', 'simply', 'good', 'idea', 'gone', 'wrong', 'unnecessary', 'addition', 'extraneous', 'humor']",The Sweetest Thing

After starting the film, it does not take too long to find out why!  Unlike a lot of RC films, this one starts out with a squabble that leads to Romance.  The ""un-catchable"" babe (played by Cameron Diaz) finally gets snared by a real charmer!Selma Blair gets her typical role as the naive young lady who always seems to get caught in the most compromising and precarious positions.  Cameron is as funny as always.  However, in my mind, it is Christina Applegate who really stole the show in this one.  I'd barely seen her since herMarried with Children - The Complete First Seasonstint.  I didn't recognize her at first as her haircolor changed.  In any case, she REALLY plays up her role as the supportive friend, and her energy really drives the film.  I'd very much like to see more of her in the near future;  hope she doesn't disappear.If you are looking for a mindless, raunchy comedy with a little twist of romance sprinkled in, then this film is for you!  There is a scene in particular in which our girls are driving down the road and encounter a biker that is sure to become an insta-classic.  I've not laughed so hard in quite some time!!

707516,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B000069HYD,"""flickjunkie""","[3, 6]","The sweetest thing about this film is Cameron Diaz.  Unfortunately, the script is so mindless and predictable that all the pizzazz that Diaz can muster hasn't a hope of rescuing this film.This is yet another tired romantic comedy about meeting that one true love on the eve of his/her wedding.  The cast is energetic but the screenplay is lifeless and crude.  Christina (Diaz) is the consummate party girl.  She never commits to a relationship.  When she runs into Peter (Thomas Jane) in a club they argue, he leaves and of course she falls madly in love with him and tracks him down on his wedding day, aided and abetted by her loyal friends Courtney (Christina Applegate) and Jane (Selma Blair).  There are a few funny scenes, but mostly it is just a parade of visual blonde jokes and tasteless humor.  The portrayals are extremely demeaning to women.Diaz is vivacious, energetic, cute, pouty and cold all at the same time.  This performance is a no brainer for her (literally and figuratively) and doesn't really test her acting ability.  Christina Applegate plays an uncharacteristically smart character (though no rocket scientist) and probably delivers the most dynamic performance of the cast.  Selma Blair is the least well known of the three, but steals just about every scene she is in.  Thomas Jane is soggy in the romantic lead with all the magnetism of overcooked pasta.This film laid an egg at the box office and rightfully so.  It had a good first week and then tanked as is often the case when a popular star like Diaz opens a mediocre film and word of mouth overcomes the initial hype.  I rated it a 5/10.

I watched ""The Sweetest Thing"" anyway.Diaz plays Christina, who looks up from her rollerblading and walkman long enough to trip over galpal Courtney anyway(Christina Applegate), dressed like a corporate lawyer.  I suppose we should believe it when we find out she IS one here, solely on the basis of her attire.  These two are best friends, and if that's not hard enough to swallow, add Jane, the third and most unwelcome wheel in this car-wreck trio.  It seems that Jane, played by Selma Blair in an eerily revisited naive, loose bimbo bent as in ""Cruel Intentions"", (see my review)is not happy unless she is being used, abused and laughed at by everyone in town, literally.  Does anyone really think this is a girl bonding film?  A girl BONDAGE film would be less humiliating to women compared to her role here.The ONLY good thing in this film, and the only character I cared about is Peter. (Thomas Jane) Peter is about to get married when he meets Christina, gyrating for a change, at a bar.  There is something electric for both, and Christina, a FEMALE commitment-phobic, feels he may be the one.  Since she can't forget him, she drags Courtney on the worlds most rediculous roadtrip to find him.  If two girls using a filthy public mens room, to wash off a container of spilled festering maggots sounds good, followed by hovering over a urinal for it's intended use...but not in any position normally used by a human, which subsequently causes a geyser to erupt from it, look no further for a quality viewing experience.""The Sweetest Thing"" tries so hard to be funny, it misses the mark more often than not.  As a woman, I can't see this being a female empowerment film.  Just because Christina is commitment-phobic, a classic man problem revisited in every venue, she doesn't get any upper hand here.  She is not a sympathetic character, and even when getting what she wants, she nearly blows it anyway.Speaking of blowing it, the trio's aforementioned Jane, played by Selma Blair has to be in one of the most humiliating roles a female has ever played.  Picture a life, where the removal of protein stains oddly positioned on clothing lead to embarrassment at the cleaners.  How about a large object lodged behind her tonsils with a human still attached, and needing to sing classic Aerosmith to dislodge it, along with a viewing audience in chorus.  Let's not forget, the conjugal visit to her workplace storage room, from a boyfriend in a big fluffy animal suit that bops her on the head repeatedly while physically engaged.  Is that what the real life of the strong modern woman is supposedly like?  I just want to let the guys know that are asking, the answer is NO.While ""The Sweetest Thing"" has a few good moments, mostly the romance between Diaz's Christina, and Jane's Peter, there are too many over the top, debasing moments to lift the film from wallowing in an abundance of trite silliness.

Hijinks ensue.What can go wrong with this?  Comedy is largely driven by the seemingly unconnected episodes of our lives, but in this movie, the unconnected episodes just seem to distract.  How does a song-and-dance number fit in?  An unfortunate incident with the braces also seems out of place as it doesn't seem to drive the story at all.

707528,A2ZE22QEXANNA6,B000069HYD,J. Frank,"[2, 4]","""The Sweetest Thing"" isn't the best movie of the year, no.  But after a particularly cruddy day, my best girl friend, popcorn, and this movie were enough to get us out of my rut and giggling.This movie was so refreshing.  Cameron Diaz at last reprises a role that makes use of her innate comedic timing, and is strongly backed by a delicious Christina Applegate as well as versatile teen-flick actress Selma Blair (who, at age 30, is Thank Merciful God finally playing someone her own age).Another reviewer suggested it was the dawn of a new genre, an approximation with which I must strongly agree.  This movie is the first so-called Chick Flick which actually looks and sounds like real girls getting together for a good time.  Yes, girls think about sex, too! Yes, they even dream sex! Yes, there is such a thing as a girl ""player""! It is a great cinematic stride when women can be sexualized without being objectified, or better yet, without being perceived as promiscuous skanks.And, in the past, the raunch has been withheld from female viewers.  Sauciness in cinema has systematically been reserved for adolescent boys and the men who think like them; the women get comedies like ""Runaway Bride,"" movies which make jokes about things like fear of commitment or weight gain.  That's not funny! It's about time we got our own sex and fart jokes!This movie, then, is a pioneer in its own way, and there hopefully will be many more movies taking a cue from its fun formula.  Perhaps you won't take your boyfriend to see it (guys probably just won't get it), and definitely heed the R rating, and no, not even all women of the target demographic will enjoy it.  But all in all, it's likely a DVD you'll want to keep hidden on your shelf for a rainy Girl's Day In.  3 and 1/2 of 5.",3,Finally!,1030060800,"08 23, 2002",2002,1782,"['Sweetest', 'Thing', ""n't"", 'best', 'movie', 'year', 'particularly', 'cruddy', 'day', 'best', 'girl', 'friend', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'were', 'enough', 'get', 'rut', 'giggling.This', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'refreshing', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'last', 'reprises', 'role', 'use', 'innate', 'comedic', 'timing', 'strongly', 'backed', 'delicious', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'as', 'well', 'versatile', 'teen-flick', 'actress', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'who', 'age', '30', 'Thank', 'Merciful', 'God', 'finally', 'playing', 'someone', 'own', 'age', 'reviewer', 'suggested', 'was', 'dawn', 'new', 'genre', 'approximation', 'must', 'strongly', 'agree', 'movie', 'first', 'so-called', 'Chick', 'Flick', 'actually', 'like', 'real', 'girls', 'getting', 'together', 'good', 'time', 'Yes', 'girls', 'think', 'sex', 'too', 'Yes', 'even', 'dream', 'sex', 'Yes', 'such', 'thing', 'girl', 'player', 'great', 'cinematic', 'stride', 'when', 'women', 'can', 'be', 'sexualized', 'being', 'objectified', 'better', 'yet', 'being', 'perceived', 'promiscuous', 'skanks.And', 'past', 'raunch', 'been', 'withheld', 'female', 'viewers', 'Sauciness', 'cinema', 'systematically', 'been', 'reserved', 'adolescent', 'boys', 'men', 'who', 'think', 'women', 'get', 'comedies', 'Runaway', 'Bride', 'movies', 'make', 'jokes', 'things', 'fear', 'commitment', 'weight', 'gain', 'not', 'funny', 'time', 'got', 'own', 'sex', 'fart', 'jokes', 'movie', 'then', 'pioneer', 'own', 'way', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'many', 'more', 'movies', 'taking', 'cue', 'fun', 'formula', 'Perhaps', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'boyfriend', 'see', 'probably', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'definitely', 'heed', 'R', 'rating', 'not', 'even', 'women', 'target', 'demographic', 'will', 'enjoy', 'likely', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'want', 'keep', 'hidden', 'shelf', 'rainy', 'Girl', 'Day', '3', '1/2', '5']",The Sweetest Thing

707539,A2YQ5O6XV23543,B000069HYD,Kevin H. Dudley,"[6, 17]","I have seen more than my fair share of bad movies during my movie watching existence. While a lot of them are so bad that they are actually funny (in a purely unintentional way of course), there have also been quite a few cinematic turkeys I've seen that are just plain bad without any redeeming qualities to be found. The Sweetest Thing falls into the latter category.On paper, the formula for this one might have looked like that it would have had some potential to be somewhat decent. You have bona-fide sex appeal in the form of 3 truly beautiful women: luscious blond Christina Applegate (who hasn't had hardly any sort of a career since her Married with Children heyday), underrated bruentte Selma Blair (who turned in a brave and daring performance in Todd Sollondz's controversial film Storytelling) and the always gorgeous (at least IMO) Cameron Diaz (who though need to put back on some weight at the time this film was made.) The script was written by Nancy Pimental who is a writer on the hit animated show South Park.But the end result turned out being of the worst movies of 2002 (if not the worst). The movie's biggest problem is its schizophrenic nature of being an in-your-face gross out comedy one minute while making a u-turn and being a sickeningly sweet romantic comedy the next.The basic plot involves 3 friends Christina, Courtney and Jane (Diaz, Applegate and Blair respectively) who are 3 young women living in upscale New York City. They basically live a life of working during the week and then heading out to the clubs on the weekends where they use their beautiful allure/charm to have flings with guys as to where there's no commitment involved. But Jane has just gotten dumped by a guy that she was convinced was the one, and to ease her sorrows, they take her out to their favorite club to dance her woes away. But Christina meets a guy by the name of Peter that night (Thomas Jane) who she immediately clicks with and falls head-over-heels in love with him almost right away. She never does make her move though and ends up going home regretting that she didn't tell him how much he knocked her off her feet. Courtney tells her that she ought to try to track him down and they end up finding out that he's left town to go to a wedding. So, Courtney and Christina decide to take an impromptu road trip while Jane stays behind with some new stud that she ends up meeting.To be honest, the movie just went steadily downhill from the get go. Even the sight of Cameron Diaz shaking her fine butt while walking up her street can't disguise the fact of how poorly executed and written this movie it. But once the road-trip section starts things get even worse as the filmmakers began to throw in some gross-out gags that are poorly staged and headache inducing instead of being funny. I will admit that the 3 leads are giving it their all, but the script is so bad that no amount of effort can make it good.Some of the ""gags"" we get subjected to involve Christina getting poked in the eye (take a wild guess by what) while investigating a hole in a bathroom wall at a run down rest stop. There's also an awful scene where Jane gets stuck in a most bizarre fashion while giving her boyfriend oral sex that is just groan inducing instead of funny. In addition to that there is some rotten food in the back of Courtney's station wagon that is flung out the window and ends up splattering on the windshield. I also almost forgot to mention an especially annoying (and migraine inducing) musical section where a whole resturaunt breaks out into a song about the many virtues of the penis.And don't even get me started on the whole ""movie-montage"" bit where Christina Applegate and Cameron Diaz try on different outfits to a really annoying song while mugging for all their worth. It goes on for far too long and might eventually be proven to cause seizures. I will admit that the sight of Cameron Diaz standing in front of a mirror in her underwear grabbing her own breasts was most pleasant, but even that is not worth the effort of sitting through this cinematic atrocity.A lot of critics put most of the blame on the director Roger Kumble who up until this point was only known for another piece of crap called Cruel Intentions. While his lackluster and clueless direction is a big problem in and of itself, the biggest problem is that the script is just plain terrible and contrived in the most headache inducing sense. I will admit that for fans of the 3 lead actresses, they do look quite gorgeous throughout this mess (especially Diaz) but it's just not worth subjecting yourself to the movie itself.The movie thankfully tanked at the box-office despite being hyped with one of the most aggressive ad-campaigns that I've seen in quite some time. But that didn't stop Columbia-Tristar from releasing a deluxe special edition DVD for it anyway.There were 2 versions of this movie released seperately: the 84 minute R-rated theatrical cut and a 90 minute unrated version that contains footage ""too sexy for theaters"" according to the front of the DVD box. From what I gathered, the whole penis-musical number wasn't in the theatrical cut and I would guess that the unrated version is basically the much raunchier of the 2 in terms of how much further the off-color humor goes.The movie itself is presented in it's original ""matted"" 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format and there is the obligatory commentary track featuring the stars and the director but they spend most of their time just cracking jokes and sucking on a helium tank making their voices high-pitched. They seem to almost be ignoring the movie for most of it, and rightfully so, it's awful. There's also some sort of a mock-documentary about the writer called ""A Day in the Life of Nancy M. Pimental"" (who I should add is quite attractive) and how her everyday life supposedly functions. There's the usual behind-the-scene featurette called ""Politically Erect"" which is basically just a big infomercial for the film. I was also surprised that there's something like 20 or so trailers for other movies on here as well.But no amount of extras on the DVD will cover up how truly atrocious this movie is. I have seen some awful movies in my time, but The Sweetest Thing easily ranks among the worst.The Sweetest Thing is unrated and contains strong sexual content, nudity, crude humor and language.",1,"Do

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[1, 2]","""The Sweetest Thing"" is one of those movies that has a plot, but doesn't really need one because it relys on raunchy humor, sexual stereotypes and a little silliness to entertain its viewers.  That isn't a bad thing.  This was a very funny film that gave the girls a chance to do to the boys what the boys usually do to them in the movies.  Cameron Diaz and Christina Applegate turn in solid performances.  Selma Blair and Thomas Jane also do a fine job.I won't get into any deep discussion of a plot with this movie because it's nothing but fun.  Watch it only to laugh.  Sometimes it does get a little too silly.  Perhaps I'm a little bit uptight, but I felt that the ""movie montage"" sequence went a little bit long.  Other than that, this movie is full of laugh-out-loud fun.  Jason Bateman's rendering of ""Eternal Flame"" is of near-classic status.Three stars isn't a bad rating in my book.  I just don't feel justified in giving more than three stars for the simple fact that this movie does get a little out of whack at times and it doesn't really have any stand out quality to it.  It's a slightly above average comedy that relies on potty, sophomoric humor.  Don't get me wrong, potty, sophomoric humor is really good when executed correctly.

The guys, however, definitely take a back seat to these three twenty something misses. I confess, it was a bit startling, though funny, to see these gals break into a song fit for a drunken stag party. Some of the scenes were done tongue and cheek. Check out the Dick and Jane scene. You will know the scene I mean, when you see it.This film is not for those with delicate sensibilities, as erect male sex organs, anal sex, oral copulation, and other usually taboo subjects are ripe for gags, many of which, while filthy, are often funny.

I can say with some confidence that this did not further the career of anyone associated with this film.  Whoever wrote the script, hopefully used a fake name.

707552,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B000069HYD,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[0, 0]","Given that my daughter was the one asking me to watch this movie, I knew immediately that: (1) it was going to be a girl movie, because that's all she ever asks us to watch, (2) it was going to be a comedy, (3) it would never be confused with art, and (4) you can't say the title of this movie and the name of any award in the same sentence because you'll gag and choke.It's interesting that the same number of people who thought all those guy movies that make fun of bimbo babes with big breasts would put down a movie that does the same thing back to guys.  In its own way, this movie is a satire of all those guy movies.  It's also slapstick in the vein of The Three Stooges and The Marx Brothers.  The three women in this movie can't seem to do anything without something catastrophic happening to them.  The humor is often gross, dealing with a variety of body fluids and other natural phenomena that polite society likes to pretend don't happen or exist.  This movie has many similarities to another Cameron Diaz movie, ""There's Something about Mary"", only this movie wallows even more deeply into bodily part and function humor.Now that I've given you all the provisos, I thought this movie was funny.  It's stupid, but then again so are many other comedies, particularly half-hour sitcoms.  The principal difference I see between most other comedies and half-hour sitcoms and this movie as that men are pretty much the butt of all the jokes.  Furthermore, several stereotypes of women (some of which are founded in a level of truth) are exploited for excellent comedic effect.  As an example, there is a scene in a restroom where Cameron Diaz and one of her friends are talking.  An anonymous woman in the restroom admires her friend's (Christina Applegate, I think) breasts as the two are talking.  Her friend tells the woman that they are fake, and tells her she can touch them.  To not annoy the Amazon censors I'll stop here, but let's say that the following events had me rolling on the floor.I suppose I should explain the plot briefly.  Cameron Diaz is a player (in the same vein as those dozens of guy movies where it's always a guy who is the player).  She tends to go through men like some people go through paper towels, until she runs into a guy that she knows somewhere in her heart of hearts is THE guy for her (Thomas Jane playing Peter Donahue).  Cameron misses the opportunity to connect with Peter, and then regrets it.  The rest of the movie deals with Cameron and Christina trying to locate Peter, and what happens after she finds Peter.I can see where this movie would offend men who can see the humor in stereotypes of women, and not stereotypes of men.  I can see this movie would offend women who do not like body part or fluid jokes.  And this movie would offend anyone who doesn't like gross sex jokes.  Everybody else will find this movie funny, with moments of outright slapstick.",4,"Gross Jokes, But Has its Funny Moments",1044662400,"02 8, 2003",2003,2916,"['Given', 'daughter', 'was', 'one', 'asking', 'watch', 'movie', 'knew', 'immediately', '1', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'girl', 'movie', 'ever', 'watch', '2', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'comedy', '3', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'confused', 'art', '4', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'title', 'movie', 'name', 'award', 'same', 'sentence', ""'ll"", 'gag', 'choke.It', 'interesting', 'same', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'thought', 'guy', 'movies', 'make', 'fun', 'bimbo', 'babes', 'big', 'breasts', 'would', 'put', 'down', 'movie', 'same', 'thing', 'back', 'guys', 'own', 'way', 'movie', 'satire', 'guy', 'movies', 'also', 'slapstick', 'vein', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'three', 'women', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'do', 'anything', 'something', 'catastrophic', 'happening', 'humor', 'often', 'gross', 'dealing', 'variety', 'body', 'fluids', 'other', 'natural', 'phenomena', 'polite', 'society', 'likes', 'pretend', 'do', ""n't"", 'happen', 'exist', 'movie', 'many', 'similarities', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'movie', 'Something', 'Mary', 'only', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'deeply', 'bodily', 'part', 'function', 'humor.Now', ""'ve"", 'given', 'provisos', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'funny', 'stupid', 'then', 'again', 'so', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'comedies', 'particularly', 'half-hour', 'sitcoms', 'principal', 'difference', 'see', 'most', 'other', 'comedies', 'half-hour', 'sitcoms', 'movie', 'men', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'butt', 'jokes', 'Furthermore', 'several', 'stereotypes', 'women', 'are', 'founded', 'level', 'truth', 'are', 'exploited', 'excellent', 'comedic', 'effect', 'example', 'scene', 'restroom', 'where', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'one', 'friends', 'are', 'talking', 'anonymous', 'woman', 'restroom', 'friend', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'think', 'breasts', 'two', 'are', 'talking', 'friend', 'woman', 'are', 'fake', 'can', 'touch', 'not', 'annoy', 'Amazon', 'censors', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'here', 'let', 'say', 'following', 'events', 'had', 'rolling', 'floor.I', 'suppose', 'should', 'explain', 'plot', 'briefly', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'player', 'same', 'vein', 'dozens', 'guy', 'movies', 'where', 'always', 'guy', 'who', 'player', 'go', 'men', 'people', 'go', 'paper', 'towels', 'guy', 'somewhere', 'heart', 'hearts', 'THE', 'guy', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'playing', 'Peter', 'Donahue', 'Cameron', 'opportunity', 'connect', 'Peter', 'then', 'rest', 'movie', 'deals', 'Cameron', 'Christina', 'trying', 'locate', 'Peter', 'what', 'Peter.I', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'movie', 'would', 'offend', 'men', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'humor', 'stereotypes', 'women', 'not', 'stereotypes', 'men', 'can', 'see', 'movie', 'would', 'offend', 'women', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'body', 'part', 'fluid', 'jokes', 'movie', 'would', 'offend', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'gross', 'sex', 'jokes', 'Everybody', 'else', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'funny', 'moments', 'outright', 'slapstick']",The Sweetest Thing

I think it is the amazing chemistry of Cameron Diaz and Christina Appelgate (who gives a star turning performace).

With barely enough plot to qualify as a sitcom episode, The Sweetest Thing fills time with random escapades, as when third roommate Jane (Selma Blair) requires a rescue squad (accompanied by a mob of singing neighbors) after a sexual encounter with her boyfriend goes wrong. Such scenes, some of them funny, are so disconnected they make the movie look like a collection of skits, but hey, they're fun!!!

It looks a fun girl flick judging the DVD by its cover, but when you actually watch the movie, it's got similar jokes from the American Pie trilogy and worse! Why the Cameron, Christina and Selma got involved in this movie is beyond me. I've seen a few movies with both Cameron & Selma in, but have only previously seen Christina in Friends, playing Rachel's sister. And Thomas Jane looking very silly with blonde hair.In this movie, you discover cunnilingus between two women, talking about girth, a mystery stain on one of their dresses, reading toilet jokes on a male toilet wall, and leading to a hole in the wall, and Selma's character is literally ""caught"" giving head to one of her boy friends. So ""caught"", in fact, that the only way she is able to remove her mouth from the poor boy's pierced male anantomy is by singing, which the crowd that gathers helps her to do by singing along!  The most cringe-worthy and excruciating of all this, is the three girls singing about a certain part of the male anatomy (is it just me, or has it suddenly got hot in here?) in a packed restaurant. I'm not a prude or anything, I just felt most of it was completely unnecessary, and pointless.If you liked the American Pie trilogy and don't think you're buying a nice safe girly movie, then go for it!

WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! I never even finished watching it; this piece of garbage was immediately donated back to the thrift store. The talented, well-known actresses were wasted with this crude, vulgar, amateurish, formulaic script. This could have been a delightful romantic comedy but instead you get a horrid little movie that vacillates between a romantic comedy and frat-boy vulgarity. The writers tried hard to imitate the Farrelly Brothers and failed--even the most crude scenes in the Farrelly films fit the story and were very funny. For ""The Sweetest Thing"", the raunchy scenes had no point, led to nowhere, and were obviously thrown in for the hormone-crazed teenage boy demographic. I can't believe this script was even made into a film. What MORON in Hollywood thought this film would be GOOD???? This is evidence that a crappy movie is not gender specific--the WOMAN who wrote this script should be shot, as she presents her female characters as the stereotypical empty-headed, horny bimbos that flourish in those bachelor party/porno flicks. This is not a chick flick by any means; the woman writer had NO respect for her characters or for her target audience, which I assume was SUPPOSED to be women. Applegate, Blair, and Diaz are way too talented for such an awful movie, and I wonder what they and their agents were thinking when they consented to star in this raunchfest in the first place. If you edit out the vulgar scenes, you have the beginnings of a funny, contemporary romantic comedy, but the writer and director failed to see that and instead goes for the cheap, moronic laughs with crude sexual content and gross-out humor that's not even funny. I'll bet Diaz, Blair, and Applegate cringe whenever they see or hear any (if at all) references to this lousy film; they are probably wishing it would disappear altogether, because being in this film was an embarrassment and one of the low points in their careers.

IMHO, Diaz was miscasted.  This movie was revealing... yes revealed a lot of Diaz's straight non-curvaceous body and her small boobs.  They should have replaced her with a dumb blonde with a more voluptuous body if this was a sexy comedy movie.  She also had some really bad close up shots which made me think how could this actress be as irresistible in her previous movie ""There's Something About Mary"".All the while the movie developed that the brother was getting married and all conversations at the driving range pointed to that until the last moment at church revealing Peter getting married (?)

If this has come to be quality entertainment in this country then we have sunk lower than my worst fears. It's not the crude humor - I like everything from South Park to Old School. It's the unbelievably awful screenwriting and tired, hackneyed humor that permeates this 90-minute disaster, most of which leaves you in a stunned embarrassed silence.Who is this film supposed to be for? Women? I surely hope not. Most women I know do not enjoy seeing their gender portrayed as the brainless, horny airheads that populate this debacle. Is it for men? Dear God no. I think I speak for all of us when I say that men do not enjoy watching attractive women act like twelve-year-old boys. Is it for kids? Absolutely not, given the sexual lewdness throughout. There's nothing wrong with sexual lewdness in itself, as long as it has a morsel of comedic value and possibly contributes to the plot or characters in at least an indirect way.But with ""The Sweetest Thing"" discussing things like plot and characters is like arguing about the arrangement of the deck chairs on the Titanic. Instead, let's discuss the film on it's own level, something that would make sense within it's context and to the cinematic connoisseurs that seemed to enjoy it - we'll just play a simple game.The rules are simple, and the first two are the hardest - you have to watch at least fifteen minutes of it, and you have to get someone else to do it with you. There. The rest is all downhill. Just count the number of times each of you says one of the following: ""Oh my God,"" ""How did this get made?"", ""Did the actors read the script before they agreed?"", ""*Was* there a script?"", ""How do big stars do movies like this?"", ""I feel insulted,"" ""Do people really think women act like this in private?"" and lastly, ""This may be the worst movie I've ever seen, definitely top five.""If you reach ten, congratulations, you win.

I really wanted to see this when it came out in the theaters, and was somewhat surprised when it disappeared after only a couple of weeks. I had anticipated having a bit more time. Well, I see now why it didn't stay in the theaters for very long: it simply isn't any good.How did Cameron Diaz get involved in such an unfunny, unpleasant film? There are so many things wrong with this film. First, the director has utterly no sense of comic timing, and scenes never have the subtle things that make for genuine humor. Second, the script is a mess. All kinds of bits and scenes are thrown in that fail time and again to advance the story at all. Instead, all kinds of silliness are thrown in every couple of minutes. Third, the movie is a virtual catalog of the kinds of jokes that can be made about human bodily fluids. Fourth, the movie has a couple of the worst musical numbers I have ever seen in a lifetime of film viewing.This should have been a good movie. All the cast members are good. I have always been surprised that Christina Applegate hasn't had her film career get off the ground after MARRIED WITH CHILDREN. She is cute as a button and utterly adorable, and she and Cameron make a devastatingly gorgeous twosome. Their friend played by Selma Blair is equally as attractive. In fact, the one pleasant thing about the film is that it is good to look at. Not just the women, but the scenery, the clubs, the grounds of the church, etc. Everything looks nice.

And underneath it all, there's a kind of ugliness. There's something ugly about a guy getting a nose-bleed as he talks about Christina (Cameron Diaz). The drunken dance-floor scenes were nauseating. It's been said that this movie gives girls a chance to be just like the guys. Fine, but if being libido-driven, alcohol soaked, and st-o-o-o-o-pid is something for young women to strive for... well, I dunno.Some reviewers have said that this movie might have been better off if it had been taken out of director Roger Kumble's hands and given over to the Farrelly Brothers. Ugh. Given the Farrelly Bros. fixation on bodily functions and handicapped people, I somehow doubt it. Actually, Kumble should be given credit for making the best out of a handicapped script.There's one particular scene that even Kumble couldn't save: the infamous bathroom scene. Watching Christina Applegate attempt to clean herself off on a urinal which bursts with water was funny enough. But the whole concept of a boy waiting all day for a woman to peek through a hole (in a MEN'S ROOM, no less) really strained credulity. Diaz' Christina's gullibility is beyond belief.However, there were some truly hilarious scenes and cameos. Georgia Engel was perfect as an overworked, behind-the-times dress shop owner.

707586,A2P53AOZ3D9S52,B000069HYD,"""shoestomp""","[1, 3]","There's something about Cameron Diaz. This is the 2nd entry in an unofficial trilogy of critic-proof comedies that the lovely thespian with the elastic smile stars in and unabashedly reveals herself to be an unnaturally uninhibited pop actress. In the first Charlie's Angels movie, she shaked her booty to the posterior anthem, ""Baby Got Back,"" even though her butt isn't exactly of the same proportions that Sir-Mix-A-Lot is speaking of. And of all places, the scene is set at Soul Train, which is filled with the sort of curvaceous babes (mostly Black) that SMAL is madly in love with. And this is exactly what I love about Diaz. She is willing to poke fun at her lack their of (and probably of other Hollywood actress' thinner lower torsos) and look totally, genuinely ecstatic in the process; you never, ever, get the feeling that Diaz is doing anything against her will.While Diaz does nothing here that's quite as show stopping as that classic moment, there is - wait a minute, actually, there is this one scene. Diaz, along with Christina Applegate and Selma Blair, perform a raunchy, wonderfully spontaneous (nearly all of the comical set-pieces are unpredictable) mini musical inside of a busy restaurant that you can only see if you view the Unrated version. This is the sort of scene one would most certainly find in a musical version of Sex and the City, which this film sort of resembles (minus the three-dimensional characterizations, pathos, and the occasionally annoying narration). Or you could think of TST as the Farrelly Brothers' version of SAC (this film sort of one-ups Ben Stiller's zipper accident).While the movie's cast is mostly filled with women (beautiful women), there's not much of anything about it that men might find too girlish to bare. Unlike your standard Julia Roberts chick-flick, the movie mostly poses a cynical attitude towards the idea of monogamous relationships (although it doesn't totally doubt the possibility of its existence; the script's pessimistic female characters are only thinking like inconsiderate, self-centered men as a last resort anyway). There's more skin bearing from the women than from the men, too. And the jokes are frank enough to keep the attention of teenage boys whenever the female cast aren't drop dead gorgeous in their skimpies. Come to think of it, TST actually resembles the Farrelly Brothers' Dumb and Dumber (which the film references in a brief montage), as two smarter girlfriends dovetail together on a road trip to reunite with a guy.I have shamelessly seen this film probably three times, which is equal to the number of times that I viewed Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle in the theater. And I am aware of this film's poor critical reception. Personally, the movie's only major flaw is that it's too short.
