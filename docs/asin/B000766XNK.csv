I found nothing in this movie that would be questionable for children.  Some might think the big fight near the end would be too violent for kids, but this grandson clearly understood that the bad guys were being beaten.  I have to say 'beaten' because I don't recall the  movie showing anyone being killed.  Even when the priest was struck, and 'blood' gushed out, it turned out to be his secret wineskin that was cut!  Then, even though the movie didn't show it actually happen, my grandson figured out that the dragon had eaten the final bad guy!  While, the movie was simple enough for a preschool boy to understand, it was entertaining enough for his grandpa to enjoy it as well.

When our hero first returns from the crusades we see a muslim friend of his dispatched and the knight that did so invade England with Vikings. We then see the hero sent on a quest with another knight to kill a dragon and save the Kings daughter. Now what makes this story is the comedy and surprises thrown in. Loosely based on the George and the Dragon tale, this is one version the whole family is sure to enjoy.As I watched this wonderfully entertaining Fantasy I wondered how did I miss this coming out in 2003? This is a fun movie for the whole family and I think it must of been in a tough crowd of releases in 2003. Otherwise we would have heard more before now. The whole cast is great and includes cameos from Patrick Swayze and Val Kilmer. I highly recommend if you enjoy  fantasy movies with comedy like ""Dragonheart"". Good quality DVD with no extras.

Tom Reeve, 2004, 94 minutes) ~Yes, it's a goofy family comedy set in the year after the first crusades. Yes, it is the most derivative thing I have ever seen even if the stealing of ideas is a kind of low-key spoof. Yes, it seems equally populated by British and American actors, and, yes, it is highly weird.But it's fun and no harm in allowing the whole family to enjoy this. Although if you want something like this at the highest caliber, I recommend Rob Reiner's timeless classicThe Princess Bride.Sir George (James Purefoy, sounds like a porn alias, right?) is a weary crusader-knight. I think he wants to get back to England or wherever he's from, but gets stuck with the care of a princess named Lunna (Piper Perabo, and it is ""Lunna"", not ""Luna"" or ""Luma""). She, of course, is an environmentalist dragon-lover and is in the possession of an egg about to hatch.So the story goes, and I will not spoil it at all except one important factor: Joan Plowright is amazing as Mother Superior. The humor is gentle and childish; the action is not head-spinning or graphic. One of the co-stars (a tiny Rollo Weeks) pretty much forbids anything too adult. Even the CGI of the dragons is the most horrible CGI I have ever watched--to keep it from being too scary, you see.So the star power surprises me without fail: Michael Clarke Duncan, Patrick Swayze, Val Kilmer, Bill Treacher, Simon Callow (yuck!!), etc., etc. It isn't a bad popcorn flick or rainy-day emergency distraction but it is definitely not the height of filmmaking. What astonishes me is the quality of the acting, even if some of the players do occasionally look a bit too confused.I will not bore you with the dozen films this has ripped off, because you'll know them when you see this movie. Please, please, do not expect ANYTHING original here. What I think this is doesn't bother me a whole lot: the British love to take working vacations and make silly things like this. They obviously have great fun with it, as the bloopers shown during the credits amply testify.So this is a spoof, a set of parodies played out delightfully and not even a note of sarcasm in any of it.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","GEORGE AND THE DRAGON, in reinterpreting the famous legend, isn't at all objectionable if you're viewing it with family, even if it's got the historical conviction of Michael Clarke Duncan - with his glaring American accent - playing a medieval Moor. There are a few touches I couldn't adjust to, such as Patrick Swayze - disinterested in his medieval mullet and muffled southern drawl - portraying an ambitious English lord or the aforementioned Duncan. At least the film doesn't take itself seriously. Within its confines it's a fun, modest adventure movie.Sir George, newly returned from crusading in Jerusalem, has had enough of battle. The English knight longs for a small parcel of land to call home, and with the promise of such, he undertakes a quest to rescue a missing princess. But what if the princess doesn't want to be rescued?Stirring the pot, the movie throws in a huge dragon egg in need of safeguarding and nasty brigands and savage Picts and even a cameo from an uncredited Val Kilmer. Sir George and the princess Lunna embark on one of those rocky romances, except that this doesn't sit too well with Swayze's shady noble since Lunna had been promised to him (er, No one puts Lunna in the corner?). Is it wrong that my favorite part is the outtakes reel during the closing credits? I pretty much knew the lay of the land once, early in the movie, that French monk careened his way on that makeshift skateboard. The CG is about what you'd expect from a low budget project.James Purefoy, whom I last saw playing the disguised prince in A KNIGHT'S TALE, has got an English accent, and he is believable and appealing as the world-weary hero knight. The royal damsel in distress is played by an American, Piper Perabo, and her English accent comes and goes, but she's feisty and pretty and so deserves a mulligan. Her spunky princess regards dragons to be an endangered species and she actually gets the ball rolling by insisting that the dragon egg be protected. Sir George would rather just stab the egg a lot. One of the best things about this movie is the state of perplexity in which George falls into whenever he has to deal with the princess. Got to be love, right? GEORGE AND THE DRAGON isn't intended as an epic sword & sorcery story. The production values aren't really up to that scale. What this is, is a diverting family movie with unexpected anachronistic stabs at humor.

During their meeting, the king informs him of his missing daughter and the former crusader takes it upon himself to find her. Little does anyone know that the princess does not really wish to be found and that she is guarding something rather unusual...It seems as though the actors/directors/producers went to the countryside on vacation separately, while there they met up with each other at the hotel lounge over hot chocolate, and then decided, on the spot, to make the best of their stay by doing a quick, impromptu, and easy film on the side for some extra cash/spending money. The word ""amateur"" in describing their work has to be the understatement of the year!The major setback is in relation to the acting (or lack of it). The acting-oh my- the acting is beyond words... School plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better acting! It is truly sad... The big names are unrecognizable! It's as if they're just fooling around or are under the influence of illegal substances.Another weakness is in relation to the very poor dialogues and the weak plot/storyline for which the writers and director are to blame.To mention just a few of these ""beauties"":1) A medieval priest making his escape from the gallows on a skateboard...2) George the Crusader, relieving himself on the beach and then pulling up his zipper, which includes the sound of an actual zipper... I did not know how advanced people were in the Middle Ages...3) George's elderly father (who by the way does not have legs) riding a straw horse into battle!4) Tarik, the Moor, repeatedly snapping his fingers on people's foreheads as a joke...5) Patrick Swayze's and Michael Clarke Duncan's heavy American accents in the midst of Medieval England...6) PATHETIC special effects AND battle sequences! (One has to see it to believe it)7) S L O W moving plot, characterized by unabated B O R E D O M...The only positive aspects of the ""movie"" are the setting/location (with the scenery being beautiful!), and the costumes, which are pretty good (though nothing great).So it's a weak plot, a great setting and a wonderful cast, which when put together fail miserably.The potential for a great movie was definitely there.In short, it could have been so much better if the actors had actually acted, and the writers/director had the ability to... write and direct!

877002,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000766XNK,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[0, 1]","George and the Dragon has an amazing cast of characters. James Purefoy. Piper Perabo. Patrick Swayze. Val Kilmer. You'd think, with this cast, and with a cool, medieval atmosphere, that it'd be a sure winner.It is amazing to me that, with these amazing characters, and with a rich storyline to portray, that the movie falls flat. You could say this would be a great movie for kids - but even there I find it highly questionable. Here's why.First, the movie has awful writing and acting. I know these actors can do far better. I've seen them in other movies where their scenes make your heart swell with emotion. Here it's as if they're getting through their lines as quickly as possible to get them over with. Sure, you can point to the dialogue which is about as awful as it come. The lines are about as cliche and cheezy as has been seen on screen. I imagine that can drag an actor down. But, that being said, I've seen movies like Disney's The Three Musketeers where the writing was atrocious and even so the stellar actors make it work. That's the job of a talented actor - to bring life into even the most inane sludge. These actors SHOULD have been able to pull it off. Why do they sound so bored? They talk over each other. They barely respond to each other. Swayze is supposed to be the &#34;bad guy&#34; but you barely feel like he cares at all about what he's doing. James is supposed to be an experienced knight back from the Crusades but he seems more a bored writer who has only written about these things - not experienced them. Look at James's acting in Ironclad - which is also about a crusader - to see the difference. James is STUNNING in Ironclad. Here he is barely present.OK, but it's for kids. Maybe you say kids don't care about acting and dialogue. What?? Have you seen the amazing movies out for kids these days? Kids are treated to stunning, powerful action and dialogue. That's what we want to raise them on. Why would we have them expect that this drek is normal and worth watching?And, furthermore, let's see what lesson we're teaching to kids here. This cast is 99% male. It's all about males out doing things and controlling things. They run into a princess who is treated like an inane, spoiled brat. Her sole interest is in protecting a dragon egg - &#34;because it's the last one.&#34; That's it, period. When asked, well how about all the villages it will destroy and lives it will slay when it hatches, she doesn't know or care. She has no thoughts. She's obsessive to the point of inanity. The above image shows her wearing a sword which is what all the promo images show as well - as if she can take care of herself. Nope - she simply whines and complains and when she finally gets into combat it's a **ten year old boy** who has to go save her. What?? Is this the message we want to send to young girls? Or to young boys about how women behave? This is the exact OPPOSITE of what I would want children to be molded by.Sure, it's fantasy. And fantasy teaches us what to aspire to. The fantasy male here is strong, brave, heroic, and does the right thing. Boys watching this want to be George. The fantasy female here is idiotic, self-centered, and obsessed. I would hope few girls would want to be like her and few boys would think this is how women act!Also, many children are quite interested in medieval culture and know a lot about it. This would be a perfect vehicle for them to learn about the culture and expand their knowledge base, if done right. There are plenty of other movies which take this aspect of their layout seriously. They know that what they portray will impact a child's impression of the era they are portraying. But George and the Dragon is ATROCIOUS at the way it portrays medieval life, in just so many ways. A kid who watches and rewatches this will end up with a slew of incorrect impressions of medieval times that they might never realize are wrong. It's not even that this movie does a disservice - it's actively damaging kids' knowledge of a real period in our history. It would be like a movie about the civil rights getting everything wrong and kids watching it thinking they now understand what went on then. Why would a director even do that?? Why not do it correctly?To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. Yes, we absolutely need kid-friendly movies which portray positive role models for boys AND girls in a healthy, interesting manner. This movie is absolutely not one of those movies. To waste a child's time watching this when they could be watching so many other movies that provide better messages with better acting and better environments makes no sense at all to me. If the parents don't bother to take the time to find those other movies, and give this movie to the child as an &#34;easy way out&#34; then I suppose I have to blame the parents. After all, the kids aren't the ones making the purchase or renting the video.Rating: 2/5.",2,Poor Messages for Kids to Watch,1402272000,"06 9, 2014",2014,4927,"['George', 'Dragon', 'amazing', 'cast',
