Romance, action, comedy, suspense, and some of the most lovable characters I've come across in a long time. This movie has two story lines. One follows Dee and Ryo's relationship. You'll really find yourself caring about these two guys and actually rooting for Dee to go all the way with him. But unfortunately it never happens because the second story line interferes with it. I really thought the movie would be ruined with this second story line but it was actually very good. A hotel worker's daughter is killed by Japanese men so he takes his anger out on all Japanese people by killing them. This kind of thing happens in real life with racial stereotyping. So Dee and Ryo have to put their romance on hold and investigate the murders. If there is any justice in the world there will be a Fake 2 and it will focus more on Dee and Ryo's love for each other.
