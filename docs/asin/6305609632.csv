470721,AK2AQIULQDFS5,6305609632,Bradley Tobin,"[13, 14]","I am of the Rare Opinion that ""Clear and Present Danger"" is the Best of the Trilogy, followed Closely by ""Patriot Games"" and then ""Hunt for Red October"". Most People I ask seem to think the exact opposite, but What do They know.For those of you who don't know, Jack Ryan is a CIA Analyst (played by Alec Baldwin in ""October"" and Harrison Ford is ""Games"" and ""Danger"") who always seems to be the Wrong guy in the Wrong place at the Wrong time.In ""Hunt for Red October"", Alec plays Jack, a CIA Analyst brought in to the White house to give his opinion on a potential Crisis. The Red October, a Russian Nuclear submarine has been hijacked by its Commander Marko Ramius (Sean Connery). His plan is to try to Defect to the Americans and turn the Prototype ship over to them. The Russians know about this, the Americans don't. Ramius has Everyone trying to stop him, Except his Crew (who would follow him to the death) and Jack, who believes he intends to defect.Though I may think this is the lesser of the Trilogy, that is not to say I don't like it. ""Hunt for Red October"" is a Brilliant Cold war Thriller that has Superb Craftsmanship in every field, Directing, Acting, Effects, Thrills... They are all here by the Bucket load. The Supporting cast includes Sam Neill, James Earl Jones (who is the only actor to appear in all three Jack Ryan Films), and Scott Glenn. They all have a Good amount of Screen time and give Standout Performances. John McTiernan's Directing is Assured. The one problem I have with the film is it does tend to Slow Down at points and that Hinders Repeat Viewings. The next two films do not have that problem.In ""Patriot Games"", Harrison stars as Jack, holidaying in London with his family. He has Quit the CIA and he is giving Lectures. While meeting up with his family, he witnesses a Car Explode and some masked men Attacking the Survivors of the explosion. Without thinking, Jack runs over and attacks the masked men; Killing one and getting wounded himself. The man he killed has a Brother (Sean Bean) who was also on of the masked men, he is arrested and Jack Testifies against him. Jack gets Knighted and Sean goes to prison. The men were an IRA splinter (ex IRA, or IRA trained) group and they bust Sean out. He swears vengeance for his brother, at any cost.Harrison makes a Great Jack Ryan; he gives him more Emotion than Alec did and Sean Bean and Patrick Bergen make very Hiss able Villains. Philip Noyce's Directing is Spot on; he keeps the Pace Quick and the Action Tough.Harrison again stars as Jack in ""Clear and Present Danger"", he has been promoted to Director General of the CIA and he is nervous. Meanwhile, a friend of the Presidents is Murdered and it is believed that Columbian Drug dealers were behind it, so the President (Donald Moffat) orders his National Security Advisor (Harris Yullin) to get tough on drugs, which they do Secretly with the help of John Clark (Willem Dafoe) and his team of Mercenaries. The Secret war is staged behind Americas back, even Jack Ryan doesn't know about it, but when the Columbians retaliate, it is Jack who is in the firing line.This one is my Favourite of the three, despite it's two hour and twenty minute running time, it never slows down or gets boring. The Acting is Top Drawer, especially from Dafoe. Philip Noyce is in the director's chair again, and he does an even Better job. In my Opinion it is a Perfect Thriller for people who like Intelligent Thrills.3 Classic thrillers in this one pack make it an Essential Purchase for Thrill fans. If you like your action heroes to be ""Thinking Mans"" heroes, then Jack Ryan suits you Perfectly.",5,"Three Terrific, Intelligent Thrillers that just get Better.",988243200,"04 26, 2001",2001,3629,"['am', 'Rare', 'Opinion', 'Clear', 'Present', 'Danger', 'Best', 'Trilogy', 'followed', 'Closely', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'then', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'Most', 'People', 'ask', 'seem', 'think', 'exact', 'opposite', 'What', 'do', 'know.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'CIA', 'Analyst', 'played', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'October', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Games', 'Danger', 'who', 'always', 'be', 'Wrong', 'guy', 'Wrong', 'place', 'Wrong', 'time.In', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'Alec', 'Jack', 'CIA', 'Analyst', 'brought', 'White', 'house', 'give', 'opinion', 'potential', 'Crisis', 'Red', 'October', 'Russian', 'Nuclear', 'submarine', 'been', 'hijacked', 'Commander', 'Marko', 'Ramius', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'plan', 'try', 'Defect', 'Americans', 'turn', 'Prototype', 'ship', 'Russians', 'know', 'Americans', 'do', ""n't"", 'Ramius', 'Everyone', 'trying', 'stop', 'Crew', 'who', 'would', 'follow', 'death', 'Jack', 'who', 'defect.Though', 'may', 'think', 'lesser', 'Trilogy', 'not', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'Brilliant', 'Cold', 'war', 'Thriller', 'Superb', 'Craftsmanship', 'field', 'Directing', 'Acting', 'Effects', 'Thrills', 'are', 'here', 'Bucket', 'load', 'Supporting', 'cast', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'who', 'only', 'actor', 'appear', 'three', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'Films', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'have', 'Good', 'amount', 'Screen', 'time', 'give', 'Standout', 'Performances', 'John', 'McTiernan', 'Directing', 'Assured', 'one', 'problem', 'have', 'film', 'tend', 'Slow', 'Down', 'points', 'Hinders', 'Repeat', 'Viewings', 'next', 'two', 'films', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'problem.In', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'Harrison', 'Jack', 'holidaying', 'London', 'family', 'Quit', 'CIA', 'giving', 'Lectures', 'meeting', 'up', 'family', 'Car', 'Explode', 'masked', 'men', 'Attacking', 'Survivors', 'explosion', 'thinking', 'Jack', 'masked', 'men', 'Killing', 'one', 'getting', 'wounded', 'man', 'killed', 'Brother', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'masked', 'men', 'arrested', 'Jack', 'Testifies', 'Jack', 'Knighted', 'Sean', 'prison', 'men', 'were', 'IRA', 'splinter', 'ex', 'IRA', 'IRA', 'trained', 'group', 'bust', 'Sean', 'out', 'vengeance', 'brother', 'cost.Harrison', 'Great', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'more', 'Emotion', 'Alec', 'did', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Patrick', 'Bergen', 'make', 'very', 'Hiss', 'able', 'Villains', 'Philip', 'Noyce', 'Directing', 'Spot', 'Pace', 'Quick', 'Action', 'Tough.Harrison', 'again', 'Jack', 'Clear', 'Present', 'Danger', 'been', 'promoted', 'Director', 'General', 'CIA', 'nervous', 'Meanwhile', 'friend', 'Presidents', 'Murdered', 'believed', 'Columbian', 'Drug', 'dealers', 'were', 'President', 'Donald', 'Moffat', 'orders', 'National', 'Security', 'Advisor', 'Harris', 'Yullin', 'get', 'tough', 'drugs', 'do', 'Secretly', 'help', 'John', 'Clark', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'team', 'Mercenaries', 'Secret', 'war', 'staged', 'Americas', 'back', 'even', 'Jack', 'Ryan', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'Columbians', 'retaliate', 'Jack', 'who', 'firing', 'line.This', 'one', 'Favourite', 'three', 'two', 'hour', 'twenty', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'never', 'down', 'boring', 'Acting', 'Top', 'Drawer', 'especially', 'Dafoe', 'Philip', 'Noyce', 'director', 'chair', 'again', 'even', 'Better', 'job', 'Opinion', 'Perfect', 'Thriller', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'Intelligent', 'Thrills.3', 'Classic', 'thrillers', 'one', 'pack', 'make', 'Essential', 'Purchase', 'Thrill', 'fans', 'like', 'action', 'heroes', 'be', 'Thinking', 'Mans', 'heroes', 'then', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'suits', 'Perfectly']",N/A

470725,A7Y6AVS576M03,6305609632,gobirds2,"[0, 0]","THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER is a highly entertaining film with an incredibly minimalist screenplay that succeeds beyond all expectations. This film's strengths are its characters and the actors that portray them. Sean Connery plays Captain Marko Ramius with great bravado and charisma relying greatly on his mesmerizing screen presence to maneuver the entire direction of this film. Tim Curry is amusing as the dutiful Dr. Petrov in a role well suited for him. The rest of the cast balances out the histrionics of Sean Connery and Tim Curry with realistic and convincing performances to bring authenticity and realism to the drama of this film. Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan, James Earl Jones as Admiral James Greer, Sam Neill as Captain Vasily Borodin, Scott Glenn as Commander Bart Mancuso, Richard Jordan as Dr. Jeffrey Pelt and an impressive Peter Firth as Political Officer Ivan Putin bring a needed sense of pragmatism to their collective roles to bolster the dramatics and emotion of the story. This was probably one of Alec Baldwin's best performances and he truly conducts himself in the manner that the character of Jack Ryan should have been portrayed. Baldwin perfectly conveyed the analytical mind that the character of Jack Ryan embodied. Sam Neill is also brilliant as the dedicated officer who also possesses a very human side that perhaps puts him in conflict with carrying out his duties to the full extent of his country's political dictates and ambitions. Sam Neill has a wonderful role in this regard and he plays it flawlessly. I liked Scott Glenn's character immensely as the US Commander who truly has to rely on his instincts and his logical interpretation of facts and events to face what is put before him. The list of performances goes on but the point is that portrayal of these characters and how they think and conduct themselves is at the heart of this film. Their efforts make this film a great political, action-adventure and emotional drama. It is interesting how Harrison Ford replaced Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan in PATRIOT GAMES and that made the film's focus around Jack Ryan as the main character much stronger. That transaction seemed flawless and a natural one. Ford's interpretation is that of a thinking man and a man of action and one of integrity in both PATRIOT GAMES and A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER. Anne Archer as Cathy Ryan in both films also strengthens the dynamics that she and her husband have a the screen. Harrison Ford's Jack Ryan is a family man and that strengthens his image of dedication to both family and country. I like both PATRIOT GAMES and A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER very much. There are very good scenes in both films. I always liked the scene in PATRIOT GAMES where Ryan stops the IRA assassination outside of Buckingham Palace. I thought Joaquim de Almeida as Colonel Felix Cortez in A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER almost stole the film with his performance, He has a very strong screen presence. With were also some very tense moments in A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER. The one actor in all three films who always steels the scenes he is in was James Earl Jones as Admiral James Greer. It really is great have all three films in one.",5,CLEAR AND PRESENT,1380844800,"10 4, 2013",2013,3186,"['HUNT', 'FOR', 'RED', 'OCTOBER', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'incredibly', 'minimalist', 'screenplay', 'expectations', 'film', 'strengths', 'are', 'characters', 'actors', 'portray', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Captain', 'Marko', 'Ramius', 'great', 'bravado', 'charisma', 'relying', 'greatly', 'mesmerizing', 'screen', 'presence', 'maneuver', 'entire', 'direction', 'film', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'amusing', 'dutiful', 'Dr.', 'Petrov', 'role', 'well', 'suited', 'rest', 'cast', 'out', 'histrionics', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'realistic', 'convincing', 'performances', 'bring', 'authenticity', 'realism', 'drama', 'film', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Admiral', 'James', 'Greer', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'Captain', 'Vasily', 'Borodin', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'Commander', 'Bart', 'Mancuso', 'Richard', 'Jordan', 'Dr.', 'Jeffrey', 'Pelt', 'impressive', 'Peter', 'Firth', 'Political', 'Officer', 'Ivan', 'Putin', 'bring', 'needed', 'sense', 'pragmatism', 'collective', 'roles', 'bolster', 'dramatics', 'emotion', 'story', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'best', 'performances', 'truly', 'manner', 'character', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'portrayed', 'Baldwin', 'perfectly', 'conveyed', 'analytical', 'mind', 'character', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'embodied', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'also', 'brilliant', 'dedicated', 'officer', 'who', 'also', 'very', 'human', 'side', 'perhaps', 'conflict', 'carrying', 'out', 'duties', 'full', 'extent', 'country', 'political', 'dictates', 'ambitions', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'wonderful', 'role', 'regard', 'flawlessly', 'liked', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'character', 'immensely', 'US', 'Commander', 'who', 'truly', 'rely', 'instincts', 'logical', 'interpretation', 'facts', 'events', 'face', 'what', 'put', 'list', 'performances', 'point', 'portrayal', 'characters', 'how', 'think', 'conduct', 'heart', 'film', 'efforts', 'make', 'film', 'great', 'political', 'action-adventure', 'emotional', 'drama', 'interesting', 'how', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'replaced', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'PATRIOT', 'GAMES', 'made', 'film', 'focus', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'main', 'character', 'much', 'stronger', 'transaction', 'seemed', 'flawless', 'natural', 'one', 'Ford', 'interpretation', 'thinking', 'man', 'man', 'action', 'one', 'integrity', 'PATRIOT', 'GAMES', 'A', 'CLEAR', 'AND', 'PRESENT', 'DANGER', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'Cathy', 'Ryan', 'films', 'also', 'dynamics', 'husband', 'have', 'screen', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'family', 'man', 'image', 'dedication', 'family', 'country', 'PATRIOT', 'GAMES', 'A', 'CLEAR', 'AND', 'PRESENT', 'DANGER', 'very', 'much', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'scenes', 'films', 'always', 'liked', 'scene', 'PATRIOT', 'GAMES', 'where', 'Ryan', 'IRA', 'assassination', 'Buckingham', 'Palace', 'thought', 'Joaquim', 'de', 'Almeida', 'Colonel', 'Felix', 'Cortez', 'A', 'CLEAR', 'AND', 'PRESENT', 'DANGER', 'almost', 'stole', 'film', 'performance', 'very', 'strong', 'screen', 'presence', 'were', 'also', 'very', 'tense', 'moments', 'CLEAR', 'AND', 'PRESENT', 'DANGER', 'one', 'actor', 'three', 'films', 'who', 'always', 'steels', 'scenes', 'was', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Admiral', 'James', 'Greer', 'really', 'great', 'have', 'three', 'films', 'one']",N/A

I buy the ones I like because I like them. DUH! The only thing I do care about buying DVDs is to buy the feature in it's OAR that it was filmed in. Any thing else is edited, therefore censored. So all my reviews of DVDs here only considers if the DVD came in the advertised aspect ratio and I only buy DVDs that are reproduced in the aspect ratio that they are made and played in at the theaters. This item - Jack Ryan 3 Pack (The Hunt for Red October / Patriot Games / Clear and Present Danger) (1990) - was advertised as being 2.35:1 which is what they played at in the theaters. What it was filmed in. Unedited. Uncensored. All three are 2.35:1. EXCELLENT! cIaO!",5,OAR (original aspect ratio) as advertised.
