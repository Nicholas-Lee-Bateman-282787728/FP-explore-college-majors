That's one of the better subplots this season with quite a few twists and turns (you never know what's coming up next)Later in the season SD-6 is finally shut down (all in one episode, which I missed the first time around, which was really confusing to me).

My only problem, which denied me giving it the 5-Star rating, concerns the first 9 episodes of Season Two.  These episodes are all exclusively concerned with the relationship between Sydney, her father Jack Bristow, and her mother Irina Derevko (a Russian KGB agent originally thought dead).  It all seemed entirely too artificial.  In fact, I'm being too kind.  The whole thing was dismal - the absolute worst being a two episode story line featuring the three Bristows hunting down nuclear explosives in India.Yet right when I thought that all hope for the second season was lost, there's a light at the end of the tunnel, and Faye Dunaway shows up to give a spectacular turn as the slightly demented head of the Alliance's joint investigative unit, Ariana Kane.  And immediately following this tantalizing cameo comes one of the best pieces of network television I've ever seen -- Episode 13: ""Phase One.""  J.J. Abrams shows complete confidence in his fledgling show and changes everything we thought we knew about the world of ALIAS.All in all, even with my gripes about the early season missteps, the second season of ALIAS is incredibly entertaining and mind boggling in its courage to destroy everything it had created within its small world and rebuild it from the ground up, piece by piece.

Vaughn (Michael Vartan) is still missing, and her friend Will (Bradley Cooper) is still with Sark (David Anders).  After Syd escapes, she and her father, Jack (Victor Garber), save Will and Vaughn.  Soon after, the CIA attempts to capture Direvko, but they fail.  But in an unexpected turn, she willingly turns herself in to the CIA.  She begins aiding Sydney in her missions by giving her hints and clues that always turn out to be valid.  Sydney wants to start trusting her, but Jack always retains his skepticism.  I won't give away any other plot lines because I have already said too much.The acting remains solid, the stories are still great, and the action is better than ever.  In fact, many of the stories are improved; last season, the episodes started off as stand-alones, but eventually, arcs began to form.  This season, the arc has already been established, and they are elaborated on beyond belief.  I would have to say that one of my favorite episodes is the Super Bowl episode that begins with the great lingerie scene.  Other great episodes include the Marshall-centric episodes where he is brought on a mission with Sydney, the Doomsday Device episode, and the amazing season finale with a shocking twist.Once again, I highly reccomend this show.

764196,A24M2KN27MDEXO,B0000ALF8I,bill_the_great,"[3, 3]","After the cliffhanger ending (what else is new for this show?) to season 1, I couldn't stand not knowing the rest of the story and buckled down and bought season 2.  I don't regret it at all.The story of Sydney as a double agent in SD-6 that began in the first season reaches a stunning climax mid-way through the season that basically changes the whole direction of the series.  The appearence of Sydney's mother in season 1 at the end of final episode becomes an intriguing plot device that leaves the viewer wondering each week which side she really is on.One of the more interesting aspects of this season is that various sub plots to the main story arc are just as facinating as the main story.  For instance, I thought the story of Sloane and his wife trying to escape from the Alliance was very interesting and added to the depth of his character.  Moreover, Marshall (who usually does a great job as the show's comic relief) gets a two part episode where he goes on a mission with Sydney was another season highlight for me.In addition, the episode writers this season showed that they were able to handle a gaggle of guest stars and still be able to keep the story moving forward.  The traditional way most television series handle guest stars with the star power of the appearences this season is to have a &quot;very special&quot; one part or two part episode in which the guest mega star is allowed to shine.  However, the writers let all of the stars (such as Faye Dunaway, Ethan Hawke, Christian Slater etc.) perfectly compliment the main storyline.  Faye Dunaway's portrayal of a spy hunter in SD-6 on Victor Garber's trail was particularly good in my opinion.If you are a fan of the series, you have to get this DVD set.  The only people I wouldn't recommend this to is people who haven't seen the first season.

The show combines the fast pace action sequences of 24 with the conspiracy theory backdrop of the X-Files. It also doesn't hurt that the show centers itself around a character that's a beautiful and mysterious woman. But the true strength of Alias, as with most successful TV shows, is its unique and creative writers who manage to always keep their audience on edge...Jennifer Garner (star of 13 Going On Thirty) plays the role of Sydney Anne Bristow, a beautiful, intelligent American woman recruited to work for the government's super secret SD-6 agency. However, problems arise when her fianc&eacute; is murdered by the agency she works for, and she ultimately discovers that SD-6 is not a legitimate government organization at all... In seek of revenge, Sydney contacts the CIA, and they deploy her as a double agent. Meanwhile, Sydney's estranged father, Jack (Victor Garber), also works as a double agent, and their relationship blossoms as a result of their work. Together, they manage to eliminate SD-6, and now both work full-time for the CIA where they're accompanied by fellow colleagues Marshall Flinkman (Kevin Weisman), Marcus Dixon (Carl Lumbly), and Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan)...The Alias (Season 2) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""The Enemy Walks In"" in which, following a long search (most of Season 1), Sydney finds her mother. Meanwhile, Michael has been swept away by a tsunami in the Pacific, and it remains up in the air as to whether or not he's still alive... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""Cipher"" in which Sydney is forced to match wits with Khasinau's front man, Sark, while Jack meets with Sydney's mother (whom he once believed to be dead), and ""Phase One"" in which SD-6 gets a new director to replace Sloane...Below is a list of episodes included on the Alias (Season 2) DVD:Episode 23 (The Enemy Walks In)Episode 24 (Trust Me)Episode 25 (Cipher)Episode 26 (Dead Drop)Episode 27 (The Indicator)Episode 28 (Salvation)Episode 29 (The Counteragent)Episode 30 (Passage: Part 1)Episode 31 (Passage: Part 2)Episode 32 (The Abduction)Episode 33 (The Higher Echelon)Episode 34 (The Getaway)Episode 35 (Phase One)Episode 36 (Double Agent)Episode 37 (A Free Agent)Episode 38 (Firebomb)Episode 39 (A Dark Turn)Episode 40 (Truth Takes Time)Episode 41 (Endgame)Episode 42 (Countdown)Episode 43 (Second Double)Episode 44 (The Telling)The DVD Report",5,Season 2 of one of the best TV shows out there...,1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,2529,"['Premiering', 'September', '2001', 'Alias', 'built', 'steady', 'loyal', 'following', 'television', 'viewers', 'show', 'fast', 'pace', 'action', 'sequences', '24', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'backdrop', 'X-Files', 'also', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'show', 'character', 'beautiful', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'true', 'strength', 'Alias', 'most', 'successful', 'TV', 'shows', 'unique', 'creative', 'writers', 'who', 'manage', 'always', 'keep', 'audience', 'edge', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'star', '13', 'Going', 'Thirty', 'role', 'Sydney', 'Anne', 'Bristow', 'beautiful', 'intelligent', 'American', 'woman', 'recruited', 'work', 'government', 'super', 'secret', 'SD-6', 'agency', 'However', 'problems', 'arise', 'when', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'murdered', 'agency', 'ultimately', 'SD-6', 'not', 'legitimate', 'government', 'organization', 'seek', 'revenge', 'Sydney', 'CIA', 'deploy', 'double', 'agent', 'Meanwhile', 'Sydney', 'estranged', 'father', 'Jack', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'also', 'double', 'agent', 'relationship', 'blossoms', 'result', 'work', 'Together', 'manage', 'eliminate', 'SD-6', 'now', 'work', 'full-time', 'CIA', 'where', ""'re"", 'accompanied', 'fellow', 'colleagues', 'Marshall', 'Flinkman', 'Kevin', 'Weisman', 'Marcus', 'Dixon', 'Carl', 'Lumbly', 'Michael', 'Vaughn', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'Alias', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'number', 'exciting', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Enemy', 'Walks', 'following', 'long', 'search', 'most', 'Season', '1', 'Sydney', 'mother', 'Meanwhile', 'Michael', 'been', 'swept', 'away', 'tsunami', 'Pacific', 'up', 'air', 'not', 'still', 'alive', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', 'include', 'Cipher', 'Sydney', 'forced', 'match', 'wits', 'Khasinau', 'front', 'man', 'Sark', 'Jack', 'meets', 'Sydney', 'mother', 'whom', 'once', 'believed', 'be', 'dead', 'Phase', 'One', 'SD-6', 'new', 'director', 'replace', 'Sloane', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Alias', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'Episode', '23', 'Enemy', 'Walks', 'Episode', '24', 'Trust', 'Me', 'Episode', '25', 'Cipher', 'Episode', '26', 'Dead', 'Drop', 'Episode', '27', 'Indicator', 'Episode', '28', 'Salvation', 'Episode', '29', 'Counteragent', 'Episode', '30', 'Passage', 'Part', '1', 'Episode', '31', 'Passage', 'Part', '2', 'Episode', '32', 'Abduction', 'Episode', '33', 'Higher', 'Echelon', 'Episode', '34', 'Getaway', 'Episode', '35', 'Phase', 'One', 'Episode', '36', 'Double', 'Agent', 'Episode', '37', 'Free', 'Agent', 'Episode', '38', 'Firebomb', 'Episode', '39', 'Dark', 'Turn', 'Episode', '40', 'Truth', 'Takes', 'Time', 'Episode', '41', 'Endgame', 'Episode', '42', 'Countdown', 'Episode', '43', 'Second', 'Double', 'Episode', '44', 'Telling', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

The interplays of the mysterious and complicated Jack Bristow, the evil but somehow likeable Arvin Sloane, the pretty-boy lover Michael Vaughn, the nerdy genius Marshall Flinkman, the steely but kind hearted Marcus Dixon... they all come together in a fantastic melody of fun and adventure that keep you wanting more, and more, and more.Even some of the side players such as Will Tippin, Irina Derevko, and FBI Assistant Director Kendall turn in stellar performances.I think what makes this series so much fun is that despite the slightly science-fiction, over-the-edge nature of the show, and despite our knowledge that deep-secret agents who defy death five times a day don't actually exist in real life, we none the less fall in love with each of the characters.  We relate, we want to be them, and the story line gives them enough actual life problems that they become real and tangible, and not the paper-thin cut outs so typical of similar shows.Tons of fun!

764203,AZVEPWRYOFBX5,B0000ALF8I,Charity Bishop,"[0, 2]","And you thought your family had problems!Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) is a double agent working for the CIA as a mole in the terrorist organization SD-6 which passes itself off as an authentic CIA division to its deceived agents. The head of the agency is Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin), a heartless assassin who will go to any lengths to achieve greatness in the Alliance, an elite terrorist operation based in central Europe... even if it means killing his own wife. He wants a seat with the Alliance and will purchase it at any cost. Working against him is his most trusted business associate and friend Jack Bristow (Victor Garber), also a double agent recruited to SD-6 during the Cold War. Through their covert missions to bring down the Alliance, Jack's relationship with his daughter Sydney has been improving by leaps and bounds. But dark secrets still stand between them.Sydney has completed her mission to recover her friend Will Tippin (Bradley Cooper) and destroy the Rombaldi artifact the Alliance hopes to use as a weapon of mass destruction. She and her handler Agent Vaughn (Michael Vartan) were separated when the building flooded and Sydney fears he may be dead. But she has more pressing problems. Captured and detained by Russian emissaries, she is horrified to learn her mother Irina Derevko (Lena Olin) is in charge of the operation. A member of the former Soviet Union sent to the US to infiltrate and betray the CIA, Irina married Jack Bristow and then faked her own death to fool the government... but not until after murdering twelve of the CIA's top agents. Sydney manages to escape but is forced to abandon Vaughn for dead. Will is also in for rough waters when he must discredit himself to avoid being killed by SD-6, since an editorial he wrote about the undercover agency was printed after his disappearance.Arrested for heroin abuse, Will loses his job as a reporter and is forced to undergo recovery therapy. While undercover in France, Sydney discovers Vaughn in the basement of a private residence and smuggles him back to the agency. After speaking at Emily Sloane's funeral, Sydney receives shocking news. Irina Derevko has turned herself in to the government, offering to share information in return for a lighter sentence. Jack doesn't trust her but Sydney is enthralled with her mother and eventually begins to be drawn into her web. A series of covert missions leads Sydney into the heart of danger, manipulation, and even romance. At SD-6, things are also heating up. Sloane believes his wife may still be alive. Someone is stalking him, leaving poison-laced wine in his house, cutting security wires, and signing in under Emily's name at their favorite hotel. This could threaten his relationship with the Alliance and make everyone at SD-6 a target.The first season of Alias proved an emotional roller coaster of excitement, never breaking its momentum even at the heart-stopping finale. If possible, the second season is even better, bringing in more of everything we loved the first time around and throwing wrenches in the emotional works as we deal with various unanticipated surprises. Even the villains get moments in which the audience feels a form of empathy toward them. Sloane is one of the most brilliant nemesis ever created. Entwined with the high-tech equipment and spying missions is a futuristic sci-fi theme tied to the artifacts of a 15th century prophet. These objects may be part of Armageddon if they fall into the wrong hands. Though morally flawed, each and every character has a drawing point. Sydney and her emotional struggle between work and her family. Michael as he deals with loving her but being unable to express himself. Sydney's clueless coworkers at SD-6, her intelligent but dangerous father, even the CIA's therapist has a few quirks.Sexual content is about level with the original season and is more teasing than graphic. Sydney is shown being de-toxified by agents (apparently nude with her arms crossed over her breasts). She and Vaughn do eventually sleep together; they do some making out before the episode ends. (Close-up kissing leads into a far-off shot of them fooling around on a bed through a camera concealed in the television in her room.) The next episode opens with them laying side by side in bed. Unfortunately many later episodes show portions of this scene as a flashback (""last time on Alias...""). Episode 21 opens with them stripping; the camera pans out after they're partially undressed. In the same episode Sydney and Michael infiltrate a ""sex club,"" and she lures a man into a back room by pretending to be a S&M; girl. She ties him up stripped down to his boxers and smacks him with a whip a few times before revealing the setup. She also goes undercover as a hooker; she slinks out in alternating red and black lingerie and makes a come-on to her client, only to turn on him and knock him unconscious.Many of her outfits are cleavage-bearing, short, tight, and immodest. We see women in their bras as they change clothes (Sydney takes off her jacket in an airport to show off a leather bra as she walks through the security scanner). She's seen partially taking off a bikini in order to lure a terrorist. None of the characters are married but all have intimate standings. Will and Francine kiss and are shown sleeping in the same bed. Michael is thrilled because Sydney offers him the middle drawer one evening while they're hanging out in her bedroom. He wakes up beside her numerous times. Still-married Jack and Irina kiss on one of their missions and probably sleep together (it has a surprising twist). A female coworker asks Marshall if he's gay. Sydney asks Francine if she's slept with Will yet. On their first date Michael asks Sydney if she wants to take advantage of a room key. She agrees but they're nearly killed in a crossfire and the date's off. Sloane is seen several times with his shirt off.Language isn't a major problem, but many uses of ""hell,"" ""son of a ..."" and several a** are thrown around. Sydney is called a ""b*tch"" in one episode. There's a great deal of punching, kicking, and other combat. People are mowed down with machine guns and shot at point-blank range with occasionally bloody results. Prisoners are tortured and mistreated. Often morphine is withheld in order to make them talk. Injections are graphically given to both good and bad guys. Sloane has a tracking device shot into the back of his neck. A box is opened to discover a severed ring finger. There are references to murder, poisoning, and other graphic forms of violent torture (a man is electrocuted, another threatened with ingesting broken glass). A woman beats a man over the head, knocking him unconscious. People are shot with tranquilizer darts. A virus has gruesome results, causing bleeding from the victims' fingertips. Characters show up with bruises, scrapes, and bloodstained arm bands after combat. A man is knocked into a propeller; others are sucked into airplane holdings, causing the wings to explode.The final episode's showdown gets brutal between two women as they fight it out in an apartment, throwing each other over counters and through glass doors. One of them is shot several times with bloody results. Bodies with bullet wounds and slashed throats are found. A bloodstained bed has a gruesome glimpse of a body with its heart taken out. The CIA (and one private individual) often use a mild form of hypnosis in order to force people to remember previous events. They're usually seen in or coming out of this trance. For lovers of James Bond-esque adventures with plenty of action, dangerous missions, enough humor to elevate teeth-clenching torture scenes, and lots of wonderful aliases, the show is a good bet. The largest disappointment is its reliance on premarital sex and the concept ""everybody does it."" The series loses much of its romantic tension after the leads become intimate. There's no longer the wonderful ""Will they get together?"" question mark hanging over their heads. In this case, writers may have done themselves a disservice by rushing the romance along.",3,Parental Review,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,8113,"['thought', 'family', 'had', 'problems', 'Sydney',

And she turned herself in?  What's she up to?That's how we begin the 2nd season of Alias.  We're still against the evil Alliance, and a couple things have changed.  Arvin is now a chairman of the Alliance, Mommy Dearest is helping the CIA from an undisclosed holding cell, and well, Syd and Vaughn are still 'Syd and Vaughn'.  Expect some crazy stuff to happen this time, as Sydney's mom, Irina Derevko, gives intel to help the CIA bring down SD-6 and The Alliance for good.  That is, until, they bring down SD-6 in the incredible episode, ""Phase One"", where everything totally changes, and the race against time truly, truly begins.  Wait until you see what happens with Will and Francie.  Not everything is as it seems.  Remember that as you keep on watching.Now, Alias took a serious risk with 'Phase One'.  The whole reason and face of the show completely changed.  Before, it was Syd as the super double agent going against all odds against her, and keeping her identity as secret.  Now, there's no secret to be kept, and things are even worse than they imagined?  How could that be?  Is mom really devoted to helping the CIA?  What really happens to Sloane?  Millions of questions are asked and only some are answered as you have to wait until season 3 to finally figure some stuff out, as that season asks even more questions.I actually liked this season better than the first, as it changed things up a bit, and it ended up being more exciting.  Let the good times roll, and buy this set, especially if you're a couch potato.  It'll give a whole new meaning to that kind of life.  :)Starring Jennifer Garner, Ron Rifkin, Michael Vartan, Victor Garber, and Lena Olin (Syd's estranged mother), this thrill rides ups and downs just got steeper and more dangerous than ever.

764205,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0000ALF8I,"Cloud ""...""","[3, 4]","While the first season of Alias definately was addicting, there was a certain formula to it all: the mistrust and lies SD-6 Operative Sydney Bristow had to tell, the countermissions she had to do since she was a double agent and the wig/dress of the week. Season 2 not only changed this slightly but gave the series a much needed booster that made it such an intriguing series that marathon watching is pretty much a given. Beware of watching this show since other stuff just might not get much attention.Picking up where the season 1 finale left off, we find out Sydney's mother, Irina Derevko is not only alive and well but actually incredibly powerful in the crime world. Which what makes her next move surprising: she voluntarily surrenders to CIA, helping out with missions but is she really helping out or does she have long term plans?The addition of the mother was definately a great one since it makes it a more compelling season emotionally. Not only is there the possibility Derevko can betray Sydney and her father Jack to their doom but that it was her own mother that did it is a great dynamic. Even by the end of it all, you're still not entirely sure which side the mother is on. Of course Lena Olin was a great casting decision and doesn't play it as that manipulative b*tch figure we'd expect to see, even though she kind of is.Some shows have a real possibility of being incredibly stagnant and repetitive. Take shows like 24 for example, a well-loved show for drama fans. Each season is essentially the same: there's some problem and Bauer must do anything he can do save lives, all within 24 hours. Alias had this possibility with Sydney spending 5 season trying to shut down SD-6 but thankfully the shows goes through a refresher of sorts with the great midseason episode ""Phase One"".The show over the years has a certain sense of preposterousness but then again this is a show with all these high-tech gadgetry and such so can you really blame certain things? Possibly since the entire premise of the show is built upon writings and inventions by a 15th century Nostradamus-like inventor named Rambaldi. Not to mention certain conveniences such as ""this extremely important intelligence came to us recently"".

Garner, Garber, Olin and Rifkin are especially good, although the talents of Carl Lumbly, Bradley Cooper, and Kevin Weisman should not be overlooked. Season 2 adds some solid emotional drama to the mix, as a person from Sydney's past returns. Good, fun entertainment, although the first two seasons are really the only two worth investing in.

The first is that, while the predictability is not nearly as blatant as Season 1, there are still moments when the plotting is clearly drawn out(e.g. Marshall flies in an airplane for the first time and is so frightened that he packs a compact parachute under his jacket, and it isn't too long before that little device proves to be useful; another section was so predictable I rolled my eyes, as a foreign contact is made more human by revealing something about him personally--why not just put a red bullseye on his back?)  However, there are so many twists that I actually gasped at, that all the rest is eventually forgivable.  The acting is once again excellent, as is the actual filmmaking.  The addition of Lena Olin is the best reason to continue watching this series, where she provides a seductively evil presence with all-too-obvious nods to ""The Silence of the Lambs"" character Hannibal Lecter.  There are plenty of action sequences that are suspenseful and fight scenes where the chroeography is so sharp that it is dance-like.  If you enjoyed Season 1, Season 2 will knock you out!

Oh, err... sorry!As I was saying, season 2 was great. The cast is wonderful. Of course, it's difficult to relate what happens to anything real but it's a minor point this season. The one thing that really annoys me is this: Sidney can kick the butts of 3 or 4 highly trained men fairly easily but she has hard time getting the better of any one woman she challenges.I wonder if it's Hollywood's ridiculous habit of trying to make us think that women are tougher than men; which of course is absurd. These TV producers must have a good reason for doing this. It might be related to when they get home at night. As Ross would say, &quot;The word you're looking for is ... Anyway!&quot;I'd also like to see the writers make an attempt at writing at least ONE joke in each episode. It would give the impression that these actors are playing human beings instead of cyber-organisms.Season 2 is almost relentless with action. And it's fun to watch. Jennifer is perfect and I can't imagine any other actress playing Sidney Bristow better than she does. And Victor Garber is also excellent as the unflappable agent who can take care of ANY problem.

764225,A3IVIS1OPYUU0X,B0000ALF8I,Henry Perkins,"[7, 8]","Series creator J.J. Abrams scored a coup when he got international movie star Lena Olin to sign on for the second season of ""Alias"".  Playing the long-lost KGB agent mother of Sydney Bristow (series star Jennifer Garner), Olin adopted many of Garner's mannerisms (including gait, a slowly widening smile, and a distinctive tucking of her long hair behind one ear) to imply an inherited bond deeper than a 20-year absence would normally signify.To these Garneresque traits Olin added a fanatical focus on her (obscure) goals.  If you've seen ""Romeo is Bleeding"" you'll know just how intense Olin can be.  But instead of the manic glee of the movie's Mona Demarkov, in ""Alias"" Olin has the calm intensity of a Zen master.  She can be sitting, perfectly still, and still project deadly menace.Irina Derevko, Lena Olin's character, is pivotal from the very start of the season.  Walking out of the shadows we (and Sydney) first see her face.  Sydney says ""Mom?"" -- and Irina calmly shoots her daughter.I won't go into great detail to avoid spoiling the ride for all you current (or potential) ""Alias"" fans.  But it's thrilling to watch Irina Derevko promoting her mysterious agenda, with the audience and Sydney never knowing exactly where her allegiances lie.  There's the usual plotline driven by creepily avuncular bad guy Arvin Sloan and his quest for the workings of 15th century prophet Milo Rambaldi.  The series changes direction halfway through with the SuperBowl episode.  And of course Sydney Bristow continues to be slicker than James Bond, but she's being steered by her mother's invisible strings more often than not this time around.  If you want to know just how a superagent like Sydney Bristow can come to be, Lena Olin as her cooler-than-ice mother is the perfect recipe.  It's a shame Abrams couldn't get Olin to return for Season Three.Notable guest stars for Season Two include Terry O'Quinn, Patricia Wettig, Amy Irving, Derek de Lint, Faye Dunaway, Angus Scrimm, Olivia D'Abo, Ethan Hawke, Christian Slater, and Tracy Middendorf.Season Two of ""Alias"": Highly Recommended.",5,Lena Olin Dominates Season Two,1104710400,"01 3, 2005",2005,2091,"['Series', 'creator', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'scored', 'coup', 'when', 'got', 'international', 'movie', 'star', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'sign', 'second', 'season', 'Alias', 'Playing', 'long-lost', 'KGB', 'agent', 'mother', 'Sydney', 'Bristow', 'series', 'star', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Olin', 'adopted', 'many', 'Garner', 'mannerisms', 'including', 'gait', 'slowly', 'widening', 'smile', 'distinctive', 'tucking', 'long', 'hair', 'one', 'ear', 'imply', 'inherited', 'bond', 'deeper', '20-year', 'absence', 'would', 'normally', 'signify.To', 'Garneresque', 'traits', 'Olin', 'added', 'fanatical', 'focus', 'obscure', 'goals', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Romeo', 'Bleeding', ""'ll"", 'know', 'just', 'how', 'intense', 'Olin', 'can', 'be', 'instead', 'manic', 'glee', 'movie', 'Mona', 'Demarkov', 'Alias', 'Olin', 'calm', 'intensity', 'Zen', 'master', 'can', 'be', 'sitting', 'perfectly', 'still', 'still', 'project', 'deadly', 'menace.Irina', 'Derevko', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'character', 'pivotal', 'very', 'start', 'season', 'Walking', 'shadows', 'Sydney', 'first', 'see', 'face', 'Sydney', 'Mom', 'Irina', 'calmly', 'shoots', 'daughter.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'great', 'detail', 'avoid', 'spoiling', 'ride', 'current', 'potential', 'Alias', 'fans', 'thrilling', 'watch', 'Irina', 'Derevko', 'promoting', 'mysterious', 'agenda', 'audience', 'Sydney', 'never', 'knowing', 'exactly', 'where', 'allegiances', 'lie', 'usual', 'plotline', 'driven', 'creepily', 'avuncular', 'bad', 'guy', 'Arvin', 'Sloan', 'quest', 'workings', '15th', 'century', 'prophet', 'Milo', 'Rambaldi', 'series', 'direction', 'halfway', 'SuperBowl', 'episode', 'course', 'Sydney', 'Bristow', 'be', 'slicker', 'James', 'Bond', 'being', 'steered', 'mother', 'invisible', 'strings', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'time', 'around', 'want', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'superagent', 'Sydney', 'Bristow', 'can', 'come', 'be', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'cooler-than-ice', 'mother', 'perfect', 'recipe', 'shame', 'Abrams', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'Olin', 'return', 'Season', 'Three.Notable', 'guest', 'stars', 'Season', 'Two', 'include', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'Patricia', 'Wettig', 'Amy', 'Irving', 'Derek', 'de', 'Lint', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Angus', 'Scrimm', 'Olivia', ""D'Abo"", 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'Tracy', 'Middendorf.Season', 'Two', 'Alias', 'Highly', 'Recommended']",N/A

764227,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B0000ALF8I,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[1, 1]","Alias initially appeared on TV at a time when ABC was noticing a decline in viewership. Prior to the release of Alias, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, which had previously been ABC's cash cow, was in decline and ABC had relied too heavily on its popularity. As a result they dropped from their coveted spot of being the most watched network on television. Of course, this could easily have been due to oversaturation as the show played three nights a week and other networks tried to repeat the success causing viewers to tire of game shows. As a result ABC started refocusing on scripted dramas in an effort to regain their place at the top of network television.While ABC had shows like The Practice, The Drew Carey Show, and Spin City that pulled in moderate ratings they needed something more to boost them back up to their previous standard. JJ Abrams had created a bonafide hit for the WB Television Network with the premier of Felicity. With the first season of Alias he created one of the few ABC shows at the time with near universal critical acclaim. On top of that it garnered fairly decent viewership in the coveted 18-49 demographic and over the first season it averaged 9.7 million viewers. Naturally this led to ABC green-lighting a second season of the show.***If you have not seen season 1 of Alias, and don't like spoilers, I recommend that you stop reading now***Sydney (Jennifer Garner) and her father Jack Bristow (Victor Garber) continue their crusade against SD-6 and its leader Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin). They find an unlucky ally when Sydney's presumed dead former KGB agent mother, Irina Derevko (Lena Olin), turns herself in to the CIA offering to help. Meanwhile, Will Tippin (Bradley Cooper) now knows the truth of Sydney and Jack's affiliation with SD-6 and the CIA and must claim that he was the victim of a drug addiction that caused him to make up all the information about SD-6 in order to keep his life. However, he finds a little solace in helping Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan) in his research, but even that may put his life at risk.Abrams and his writers really up the ante on the second season of Alias. With the addition of Lena Olin's Derevko and more details about the Alliance of 12 we get more suspense. Derevko's allegiances are never really known to the audience, even when it seems that she may have betrayed her daughter and the CIA. Sloan is fleshed out more than he was previously as we begin to learn more of his motivations and the truth of exactly what he may (or may not) know about what's going on around him. The crew once again does a great job focusing more on characters and relationships and not overpowering the series with gadgets as most spy shows would do. We get quite a bit more of the mythology behind Milo Rambaldi, but even the lore of the Renaissance-era inventor doesn't take precedence over the characters.Throughout the second season many of the characters, and the actors who portray them, get more of an opportunity to show off their skills where they didn't really get an opportunity to previously. Kevin Weisman's Marshall Flinkman, usually the comedic anchor of the show as SD-6's tech guy, gets the opportunity to go on a mission and participate in a little bit of an action. His part in the season is largely expanded allowing more of a chance to shine in the series. Carl Lumbly, as Marcus Dixon, also gets the opportunity to delve deeper into the emotional core of his character showing that he is more than just a device to drive forward the plot. Merrin Dungey, who plays Sydney's best friend Francie, also has the opportunity to join in the fun of the spy world, but for more on that you have to watch the series.I really enjoyed the second season of this series, although I lamented the fact that we spent much more time in the spy world than we did in season one. Where in season one we had the opportunity to watch Sydney juggle her home life and college career with her work as a spy, in the second season a large part of that is missing as Francie is now the only member of her inner circle that doesn't know her secret and her college career is all but missing (with the exception of a shot of Sydney in her graduation gown). All in all though this is an exciting action packed second season that almost lives up to the first season.4/5Be sure to to check out:Armadillo & Sands: Intellectual Properties at Work!",4,Alias Season 2,1325721600,"01 5, 2012",2012,4403,"['Alias', 'initially', 'appeared', 'TV', 'time', 'when', 'ABC', 'was', 'noticing', 'decline', 'viewership', 'Prior', 'release', 'Alias', 'Who', 'Be', 'Millionaire', 'had', 'previously', 'been', 'ABC', 'cash', 'cow', 'was', 'decline', 'ABC', 'had', 'relied', 'too', 'heavily', 'popularity', 'result', 'dropped', 'coveted', 'spot', 'being', 'most', 'watched', 'network', 'television', 'course', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'due', 'oversaturation', 'show', 'played', 'three', 'nights', 'week', 'other', 'networks', 'tried', 'repeat', 'success', 'causing', 'viewers', 'tire', 'game', 'shows', 'result', 'ABC', 'started', 'refocusing', 'scripted', 'dramas', 'effort', 'regain', 'place', 'top', 'network', 'television.While', 'ABC', 'had', 'shows', 'Practice', 'Drew', 'Carey', 'Show', 'Spin', 'City', 'pulled', 'moderate', 'ratings', 'needed', 'something', 'more', 'boost', 'back', 'previous', 'standard', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'had', 'created', 'bonafide', 'hit', 'WB', 'Television', 'Network', 'premier', 'Felicity', 'first', 'season', 'Alias', 'created', 'one', 'few', 'ABC', 'time', 'near', 'universal', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'top', 'garnered', 'fairly', 'decent', 'viewership', 'coveted', '18-49', 'demographic', 'first', 'season', 'averaged', '9.7', 'million', 'viewers', 'Naturally', 'led', 'ABC', 'green-lighting', 'second', 'season', 'show', '***If', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'season', '1', 'Alias', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'spoilers', 'recommend', 'stop', 'reading', 'now***Sydney', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'father', 'Jack', 'Bristow', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'continue', 'crusade', 'SD-6', 'leader', 'Arvin', 'Sloane', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', 'find', 'unlucky', 'ally', 'when', 'Sydney', 'presumed', 'dead', 'former', 'KGB', 'agent', 'mother', 'Irina', 'Derevko', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'CIA', 'offering', 'help', 'Meanwhile', 'Will', 'Tippin', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'now', 'truth', 'Sydney', 'Jack', 'affiliation', 'SD-6', 'CIA', 'must', 'claim', 'was', 'victim', 'drug', 'addiction', 'caused', 'make', 'up', 'information', 'SD-6', 'order', 'keep', 'life', 'However', 'little', 'solace', 'helping', 'Michael', 'Vaughn', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'research', 'even', 'may', 'put', 'life', 'risk.Abrams', 'writers', 'really', 'ante', 'second', 'season', 'Alias', 'addition', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'Derevko', 'more', 'details', 'Alliance', '12', 'get', 'more', 'suspense', 'Derevko', 'allegiances', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'known', 'audience', 'even', 'when', 'may', 'have', 'betrayed', 'daughter', 'CIA', 'Sloan', 'fleshed', 'more', 'was', 'previously', 'begin', 'learn', 'more', 'motivations', 'truth', 'exactly', 'what', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'crew', 'once', 'again', 'great', 'job', 'focusing', 'more', 'characters', 'relationships', 'not', 'overpowering', 'series', 'gadgets', 'most', 'spy', 'shows', 'would', 'do', 'get', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'mythology', 'Milo', 'Rambaldi', 'even', 'lore', 'Renaissance-era', 'inventor', ""n't"", 'take', 'precedence', 'characters.Throughout', 'second', 'season', 'many', 'characters', 'actors', 'who', 'portray', 'get', 'more', 'opportunity', 'show', 'off', 'skills', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'opportunity', 'previously', 'Kevin', 'Weisman', 'Marshall', 'Flinkman', 'usually', 'comedic', 'anchor', 'show', 'SD-6', 'tech', 'guy', 'opportunity', 'go', 'mission', 'participate', 'little', 'bit', 'action', 'part', 'season', 'largely', 'expanded', 'allowing', 'more', 'chance', 'shine', 'series', 'Carl', 'Lumbly', 'Marcus', 'Dixon', 'also', 'opportunity', 'delve', 'deeper', 'emotional', 'core', 'character', 'showing', 'more', 'just', 'device', 'drive', 'forward', 'plot', 'Merrin', 'Dungey', 'who', 'Sydney', 'best', 'friend', 'Francie', 'also', 'opportunity', 'join', 'fun', 'spy', 'world', 'more', 'have', 'watch', 'series.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'second', 'season', 'series', 'lamented', 'fact', 'spent', 'much', 'more', 'time', 'spy', 'world', 'did', 'season', 'one', 'Where', 'season', 'one', 'had', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'Sydney', 'juggle', 'home', 'life', 'college', 'career', 'work', 'spy', 'second', 'season', 'large', 'part', 'missing', 'Francie', 'now', 'only', 'member', 'inner', 'circle', ""n't"", 'know', 'secret', 'college', 'career', 'missing', 'exception', 'shot', 'Sydney', 'graduation', 'gown', 'exciting', 'action', 'packed', 'second', 'season', 'almost', 'up', 'first', 'season.4/5Be', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'Armadillo', 'Sands', 'Intellectual', 'Properties', 'Work']",N/A

Soon after shooting Sydney her mother turns herslef into the C.I.A. Sydney is pushed to go get information from her although she despises her and tells herself that her real mom died in a car accident. Despite warnings from her father  to not trust her mom, she starts to not just trust her but love her as well. The episode where the mom is needed in-order to do a mission is the one. Because you get Sydney working with her parents together for the first and only time.Another great episode of this season is the one with an appearence by Ethan Hawke. He plays an agent who was captured and doubled by scientist. In a great scene Sydney has to figure out which is the real agent and who to shoot. I know that sounds familiar and you may have seen it before but the way the show handles it is still very cool. Besides Ethan Hawkes appeapence, Faye Dunaway, Rutger Haurer (Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Blade Runner) and Christian Slater also apear in other episodes. I liked Quentin Tarantino and Roger Moore's appearences the first season and these are good as well. I can't wait to see who appears in the 3rd season.Anyway this season is full of surprises and plot turns. It's very well written, the action is better than what you get from movies and the cast is fantastic. To me Jennifer Garner is the next Julia Roberts but a Julia Roberts that just can't act well but kick ass as well. Michael Vartan (Never Been Kissed) is excellent as well as Sydney's handler and potential b/f. Hell everyone is good in their roles and all of them have intersting characters as well.

I was blown away by the second season. It's even more exciting and dramatic, with almost every episode revealing something shocking. Most of this is thanks to the brilliant Lena Olin who joins the cast as Sydneys mother. The storyline is brilliant and there were plenty of Oh My God moments. This season also gave more for Francie (Merrin Dungey) and Will (Bradley Cooper) to do. Their storylines were just as exciting and intense, and cultivated in a fantastic final episode that could go down as one of the best cliffhanger episoded in television. All of this though could not be possible without the amazing Jennifer Garner. Proving once again she was one of the best actresses on television today.

764234,A3AFNUPOSK2QGV,B0000ALF8I,"Joe Kenney ""buttergun""","[9, 13]","Season Two of Alias derails hard throughout its first half, before awkwardly getting back on track for a fine second half.  The season pales before the bright and energetic Season One, but this is the better season in one key area: namely, the action is handled more maturely.  In Season One, all super-agent Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) needed to survive in the world of international espionage was a few martial arts moves and a wig.  This season she actually carries a weapon on missions, but she still delves into ""Buffy"" garbage, unrealistically high-kicking her way out of danger.  Production values are also improved.  Season One looked great, but each episode of Two looks like a glossy film.  Stories are more intelligently constructed this time out, improving upon the narrow-minded video game-style storylines of Season One.Picking up from the first season's cliffhanger ending, Season Two opens with Sydney the captive of her turncoat mother, Irina Derevko.  Syd soon escapes, but not long afterward her mother turns herself in to the CIA, though no one's sure why.  This proves to be the gist of Season Two: Syd and her fellows will go out on missions, using info gleaned from the apparently-omniscient Derevko.  At the same time, Syd must come to terms with her mother (which entails LOTS of crying; the melodrama's piled on thick this season, people), while also moving in on hawk-nosed and pinch-faced love interest Michael Vaughn, whose father, of course, was murdered long ago by Sydney's mother.  Yes, Alias takes place in a very small world.This repetitive storyline with Derevko also harms my favorite character in the show: Victor Garber's Jack Bristow, who basically acts as a forlorn, cynical foil throughout most of the season.  On the other hand, Ron Rifkin is free to ham it up as the villainous Arvin Sloane, and he carries the first half of Season Two.  Jennifer Garner gets lots of opportunities to hone her drama skills, and I have to admit that she comes off as a very likeable person.  No wonder so many guys are crazy about her.  It's mostly the skills of the actors which carry you through the muddled first part of this season, but then on Disc 4 of the set, things change fast.Apparently creator/producer JJ Abrams decided a change was due, not just to a few storylines, but to the framework of the show itself.  Previous to this change, the series had followed the same pattern each episode: Syd would receive her mission from SD-6, plan a countermission with Vaughn and the CIA, go out on the job, get in a few scrapes, and arrange it so that the CIA benefited from the mission and SD-6 did not, all while struggling to retain her cover.With one fell stroke, Abrams crumbles this foundation, halfway through Season Two.  Gone are SD-6, the mission/countermission scenario, the constant, tearful trips to Derevko's prison cell for info, and most importantly, the nauseating ""will they or won't they?"" Syd/Vaughn shenanigans.  In a way, the change streamlines the series, but it's very jarring, and characters change without warning.For one, Sloane's character becomes a cold-blooded, murderous mastermind, more of a comic book caricature than the steely schemer he'd been before.  Same for British nuisance Sark, who quickly goes from being a mischievous presence to an outright deadly one.  In fact, shortly after his intro early in the season, it's hinted that Sark and Sydney could become involved (he flirts with her and she claims he is ""cute""), and it's even hinted that the two of them share a lot in common, as Sark says that he considers Irina Derevko a mother figure.  But all such promise is cast aside as Sark morphs into a one-note murdering machine, one who becomes even more of an infuriating nuisance (for the viewer, not just for Sydney) in Season Three.But the most frustrating change the mid-season switch-up creates is the quick and unbelievable wrap-up of the SD-6/Alliance network.  Season One featured multiple scenes in which Sydney was reminded that it would take at least several years to wipe out not only SD-6, but the global Alliance organization.  This is conveniently forgotten, as in one single episode Sydney and her CIA pals are able to crush the entire core of the Alliance.  It's awkward and not very well thought out.  It seems like what it apparently was: Abrams getting bored with the corner he'd written himself into, and wanting to do something different.  However, I can't complain too much, because one of the best things about Season Two is the lack of all of the ""chosen one"" prophecy ""Buffy""-type nonsense which was hinted at in Season One, and which unfortunately returns with a mind-numbing vengeance in Season Three.The season takes a while to get going, but early on there's a well-done multiple-episode storyline in which Sydney, her father, and her mother must infiltrate a former Soviet prison to unearth nuclear warheads.  It's later in the season when things really pick up: there's the infamous ""Super Bowl episode,"" which more than any other in the series' history brought the show into the public eye, as it was broadcast at an ideal time slot and opened with several shots of Sydney in revealing lingerie, brilliantly capturing the interest of all of the testosterone-laden Super Bowl viewers.  Even better is a late-season episode in which Syd's pal Will, former journalist turned CIA analyst, must survive a commando attack on the prisoner transport he's held captive in.Special mention must be made of the episode with Ethan Hawke, one of the episodes after the mid-season shake-up which displays the true promise of the show's ""spy-fi"" makeup.  Speaking of guest stars, they get pretty annoying this season, particularly Faye Dunaway, who looks like a walking skeleton in her portrayal of an Alliance interrogator.  And speaking just in terms of action, the show packs more explosions and a lot more gun fights than Season One, though serious action fans will be more impressed by the first half of Season Three.  Sci-fi fans will however enjoy the second half of this season, which features cloning and other high-tech concepts more comfortable in a science fiction film.Anyway, Season Two is a bumpy ride, but a mostly enjoyable one.  The DVD presentation is flawless, both in picture and sound.  Even the packaging is an improvement upon Season One's bootleg-like appearance.  It's just that the show mercilessly shatters itself apart mid-season harms the integrity of the series, even if it improves certain aspects at the same time. So I give this season a half-hearted recommendation.",3,The Crying Spy meets her crying mother,1100649600,"11 17, 2004",2004,6595,"['Season', 'Two', 'Alias', 'hard', 'first', 'half', 'awkwardly',

764240,A1403J18C3KRAC,B0000ALF8I,Justin F.,"[0, 0]","In my experience Season 2 seems to be the most popular and beloved season of the show among fans and critics alike and it's a hard belief to argue against, though for me personally it's roughly tied for that honor with Season 3, which sadly most seem to regard as the start of the downward spiral of the show. Season 2 features each of the two most popular, highly-regarded shows of the series by mainstream fans- the mid-season turning-point episode ""Phase One,"" which was the post-Super Bowl episode and the season finale, ""The Telling."" Both of these are masterful hours of television for the most part though the first 10 minutes or so of Phase One crosses the line of what I'm willing to see on network television. I thought ABC played a huge part in the show not being that big of a hit by making the entire series appear to be nothing more than Jennifer Garner running around in very little despite the show being probably the most intelligent on the networks at the time. This was the biggest reason I didn't start watching the show until I got hooked on TNT late night reruns just a few months before the final two episodes of the series in 2006. The first act of Phase One can't be blamed on ABC portraying the show wrongly (though they did make their promo for this episode feature the first act almost exclusively as I recall), that one is on the producers and, as epic and important an episode as it it, they held it back a bit in my mind and turned a lot of potential new fans of the show off with that stunt and by post-Super Bowl standards the ratings for this episode were very poor. For the most part I'd say Alias is just a bit more family-friendly, for lack of a better term, and certainly a whole lot more intelligent and developed than the ABC promos ever suggested, Phase One starts off as a very adult-oriented and shallow episode though before catching fire and becoming one of the great episodes of the series.This season has a ton of very good, very popular episodes after the top two as well. As you get closer to Phase One you may notice Jack and/or Sydney are going on CIA missions frequently while they're still working with SD6, who throughout season 1 summoned them constantly at all random times, and that pushes my suspension of disbelief a bit- especially upon repeated viewings. I took this as a sign that, as beloved as the dual double agents story line was, it was running out of steam and needed to be changed.

764247,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000ALF8I,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[34, 41]","First off, kudos to the producers of this show for getting out the complete second season of ""Alias"" out so quickly after the first and pretty much in time for the start of repeats from the show's current third season.  For those of us who came aboard with the celebrated post Super Bowl episode (""What...was...wrong...with...the...black...one""), this has helped fill in the whole back story on Sydney's mom and pop, how Francie became Allison, and the rest of the intrigue from the critically acclaimed ABC series (a way of saying the Nielsen ratings are not in relationship to the quality of the show).  They might have used ""the...black...one"" to reel in new viewers, but ""Alais"" is about so much more than Jennifer Garner in lingerie (or red wigs, or whatever new look they come up with each week).When last we left double-agent Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) at the end of the Complete First Season she had just discovered that ""The Man"" was really her mom, Irina Derevko, who is played by Lena Olin.  This casting just underscores the strong supporting cast, which has heavyweights Ron Rifkin (Arvin Sloane) and Victor Garber (Jack Bristow) stealing scenes from all the kiddies right and left.  With Derevko added to the mix along with SD-6 and the Rambaldi artifacts, things are even more convoluted and confusing, which is half the fun.  The characters do not really know what is going on, so why should the audience expect to be in a better position?  The short answer is that they should not, and be challenged by this rewarding series would be a good thing worth treasuring.  The other half of the fun here is the speculation as to what is going on and what might happen next.While Sydney is having fun with mom and dad (the family that shoots automatic weapons together has successful missions to India together), other members of the supporting cast come into their own, most notably the season's roller coaster ride for Will Tippin (Bradley Cooper) and the world coming crashing down on Marcus Dixon (Carl Lumbley) not once, but twice.  Even Marshall (Kevin Weisman) has his moments of glory, and special recognition goes to Terry O'Quinn as FBI Assistant Director Kendall for being a master of exposition.  Still, I have to admit that the two most compelling characters were Arvin Sloane and Irina Derevko.  As much as Sloane's place in the Alliance matters, both his wife (Amy Irving) and the Rambaldi artifacts matter more, and he finally proves himself a criminal mastermind.  But with Derevko ""Alias"" has its ultimate wildcard, because you know everything out of her life is half-truth and half-lie, and even when the dust is settled from each of her escapades you are still never really clear as to which is which.It makes perfect sense that at the end of the first season I thought that Sydney cried a lot for somebody that was Jack Bristow's daughter and at the end of the second I was wondering how our heroine was Irina Derevko's daughter.  You have to admit, that in any given episode Sydney cries more than her parents have in their combined life.  I mean for Jack Bristow becoming enraged is cutting off Marshall in the middle of one of his circular speeches.  Still, for those of us going through withdrawal from the demise of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" I have to admit that ""Alias"" helps fill the void, especially with one of the more unique cliffhangers ending this second season as creator Jeffrey Abrams found a creative way of keeping Sydney and Vaughn (Michael Vartan) apart (at least, on camera).  The DVD extras are decent, with outtakes, featurettes, and a few commentary tracks where the cast and crew admire their work.",5,Unraveling plans within plans in a gloriously twisted series,1072051200,"12 22, 2003",2003,3661,"['First', 'off', 'kudos', 'producers', 'show', 'getting', 'out', 'complete', 'second', 'season', 'Alias', 'out', 'so', 'quickly', 'first', 'pretty', 'much', 'time', 'start', 'repeats', 'show', 'current', 'third', 'season', 'who', 'came', 'aboard', 'celebrated', 'post', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'episode', 'What', 'was', 'wrong', 'black', 'one', 'helped', 'fill', 'whole', 'back', 'story', 'Sydney', 'mom', 'pop', 'how', 'Francie', 'became', 'Allison', 'rest', 'intrigue', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'ABC', 'series', 'way', 'saying', 'Nielsen', 'ratings', 'are', 'not', 'relationship', 'quality', 'show', 'might', 'have', 'used', 'black', 'one', 'reel', 'new', 'viewers', 'Alais', 'about', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'lingerie', 'red', 'wigs', 'new', 'look', 'come', 'up', 'week', '.When', 'last', 'left', 'double-agent', 'Sydney', 'Bristow', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'end', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'had', 'just', 'discovered', 'Man', 'was', 'really', 'mom', 'Irina', 'Derevko', 'who', 'played', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'casting', 'just', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'heavyweights', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', 'Arvin', 'Sloane', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'Jack', 'Bristow', 'stealing', 'scenes', 'kiddies', 'right', 'left', 'Derevko', 'added', 'mix', 'SD-6', 'Rambaldi', 'artifacts', 'things', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'convoluted', 'confusing', 'fun', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'why', 'should', 'audience', 'expect', 'be', 'better', 'position', 'short', 'answer', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'challenged', 'rewarding', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'treasuring', 'other', 'half', 'fun', 'here', 'speculation', 'what', 'going', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'next.While', 'Sydney', 'having', 'fun', 'mom', 'dad', 'family', 'automatic', 'weapons', 'together', 'successful', 'missions', 'India', 'together', 'other', 'members', 'supporting', 'cast', 'come', 'own', 'most', 'notably', 'season', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'Will', 'Tippin', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'world', 'coming', 'crashing', 'down', 'Marcus', 'Dixon', 'Carl', 'Lumbley', 'not', 'once', 'twice', 'Even', 'Marshall', 'Kevin', 'Weisman', 'moments', 'glory', 'special', 'recognition', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'FBI', 'Assistant', 'Director', 'Kendall', 'being', 'master', 'exposition', 'Still', 'have', 'admit', 'two', 'most', 'compelling', 'characters', 'were', 'Arvin', 'Sloane', 'Irina', 'Derevko', 'As', 'much', 'Sloane', 'place', 'Alliance', 'matters', 'wife', 'Amy', 'Irving', 'Rambaldi', 'matter', 'more', 'finally', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'Derevko', 'Alias', 'ultimate', 'wildcard', 'know', 'everything', 'life', 'half-truth', 'half-lie', 'even', 'when', 'dust', 'settled', 'escapades', 'are', 'still', 'never', 'really', 'clear', 'which.It', 'perfect', 'sense', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'thought', 'Sydney', 'cried', 'lot', 'somebody', 'was', 'Jack', 'Bristow', 'daughter', 'end', 'second', 'was', 'wondering', 'how', 'heroine', 'was', 'Irina', 'Derevko', 'daughter', 'have', 'admit', 'given', 'episode', 'Sydney', 'more', 'parents', 'have', 'combined', 'life', 'mean', 'Jack', 'Bristow', 'becoming', 'enraged', 'cutting', 'off', 'Marshall', 'middle', 'one', 'circular', 'speeches', 'Still', 'going', 'withdrawal', 'demise', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'have', 'admit', 'Alias', 'fill', 'void', 'especially', 'one', 'more', 'unique', 'cliffhangers', 'ending', 'second', 'season', 'creator', 'Jeffrey', 'Abrams', 'found', 'creative', 'way', 'keeping', 'Sydney', 'Vaughn', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'apart', 'least', 'camera', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'decent', 'outtakes', 'featurettes', 'few', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'where', 'cast', 'crew', 'admire', 'work']",N/A

I was completely thrilled to find that they had kept the great smart-spy action of Season 1 - while ratcheting the emotional and cohesivity of the storyline.Season 1 had been in many ways a ""gimmick"" season. You had the unrequited love of Vaughn and Sidney. You had the new-costume-of-the-day in an exotic location. You had the everybody-is-lying aspect. While all of these were fun, they could have gotten old if we went through another season of that.Instead, I really have to give great kudos to the writing / direction team here. They made some rather sweeping plot developments that turned everything on its head. Unlike many other shows where they drag out the angst for years, they let Vaughn and Sidney really connect. They had numerous great episodes with father, mother and daughter having fantastic interplay. Other plot developments were fascinating without seeming TOO contrived.I had complained with Season 1 that a number of situations were quite illogical. They did a *much* better job in this season of having at least some base for why the various things happened. It could all make sense. Sydney wasn't throwing tantrums. Will was INCREDIBLY more mature and someone you could relate to. As always, even the ""bad guys"" had texture and meaning. They weren't just demonically possessed monsters - they had reasons for what they did that made sense. You could relate to them even while disapproving of them.Even as a benefit, their last episode commentary doesn't seem to have any spoilers in it! I had a few things in season 2 ""ruined"" for me because when I watched the season 1 commentary they talked about things that only happened in season 2. They didn't do that in the commentary here, for which I was quite grateful. They commentaries are a ton of fun to listen to - it's well worth it.The cliffhanger ending was *great* - again resounding with the emotional power of this season. It was just about the perfect ending to the season - and one that definitely made me eager to immediately start watching season 3.There's one episode in particular that actually made me tear up, because it was so incredibly poignant. That's when you know that a TV show has really portrayed its characters well, when you care so much about them and what they are going through that it affects you that deeply, emotionally.There is one clue about a major plot point that seems to have been completely missed by EVERYONE until it's ""too late"" - and it still baffles me how that could have happened plot-wise. Surely as soon as all of these brilliant deductors and researchers saw the clue they would have connected the dots. Again it's hard to talk about the situation without giving away fascinating plot development. Still, that was my only real complaint with the season. I wish they'd at least given some justification for everyone not considering the clue, since it was such an important item.Highly recommended!",5,Amazing Drama on Many Levels,1144454400,"04 8, 2006",2006,3041,"['loved', 'watching', 'Alias', 'Season', '1', 'looked', 'greatly', 'forward', 'watching', 'Season', 'DVD', '2', 'set', 'pretty', 'much', 'straight', 'was', 'completely', 'thrilled', 'find', 'had', 'kept', 'great', 'smart-spy', 'action', 'Season', '1', 'ratcheting', 'emotional', 'cohesivity', 'storyline.Season', '1', 'had', 'been', 'many', 'ways', 'gimmick', 'season', 'had', 'unrequited', 'love', 'Vaughn', 'Sidney', 'had', 'new-costume-of-the-day', 'exotic', 'location', 'had', 'everybody-is-lying', 'aspect', 'were', 'fun', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'old', 'went', 'season', 'that.Instead', 'really', 'have', 'give', 'great', 'kudos', 'writing', '/', 'direction', 'team', 'here', 'made', 'rather', 'sweeping', 'plot', 'developments', 'turned', 'everything', 'head', 'many', 'other', 'shows', 'where', 'drag', 'out', 'angst', 'years', 'let', 'Vaughn', 'Sidney', 'really', 'connect', 'had', 'numerous', 'great', 'episodes', 'father', 'mother', 'daughter', 'having', 'fantastic', 'interplay', 'Other', 'plot', 'developments', 'were', 'fascinating', 'seeming', 'TOO', 'contrived.I', 'had', 'complained', 'Season', '1', 'number', 'situations', 'were', 'quite', 'illogical', 'did', '*much*', 'better', 'job', 'season', 'having', 'least', 'base', 'why', 'various', 'things', 'happened', 'could', 'all', 'make', 'sense', 'Sydney', 'was', ""n't"", 'throwing', 'tantrums', 'Will', 'was', 'INCREDIBLY', 'more', 'mature', 'someone', 'could', 'relate', 'always', 'even', 'bad', 'guys', 'had', 'texture', 'meaning', 'were', ""n't"", 'just', 'demonically', 'possessed', 'monsters', 'had', 'reasons', 'what', 'did', 'made', 'sense', 'could', 'relate', 'even', 'disapproving', 'them.Even', 'benefit', 'last', 'episode', 'commentary', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'spoilers', 'had', 'few', 'things', 'season', '2', 'ruined', 'when', 'watched', 'season', '1', 'commentary', 'talked', 'things', 'only', 'happened', 'season', '2', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'commentary', 'here', 'was', 'quite', 'grateful', 'commentaries', 'are', 'ton', 'fun', 'listen', 'well', 'worth', 'it.The', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'was', '*great*', 'again', 'resounding', 'emotional', 'power', 'season', 'was', 'just', 'perfect', 'ending', 'season', 'one', 'definitely', 'made', 'eager', 'immediately', 'start', 'watching', 'season', '3.There', 'one', 'episode', 'particular', 'actually', 'made', 'tear', 'up', 'was', 'so', 'incredibly', 'poignant', 'when', 'know', 'TV', 'show', 'really', 'portrayed', 'characters', 'well', 'when', 'care', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'deeply', 'one', 'clue', 'major', 'plot', 'point', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'missed', 'EVERYONE', 'too', 'late', 'still', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'plot-wise', 'Surely', 'as', 'soon', 'brilliant', 'deductors', 'researchers', 'saw', 'clue', 'would', 'have', 'connected', 'dots', 'Again', 'hard', 'talk', 'situation', 'giving', 'away', 'fascinating', 'plot', 'development', 'Still', 'was', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'season', 'wish', ""'d"", 'least', 'given', 'justification', 'everyone', 'not', 'considering', 'clue', 'was', 'such', 'important', 'item.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

However, starting with episode thirteen, ""Phase One,"" some big shake-ups start to occur.  I will not say who, but a favorite character is brutally killed.  I was shocked and disheartened by this.  There is commentary on this episode by JJ Abrams, Jennifer Garner, Jack Bender, GregGrunberg, Michael Vartan, and Victor Garber.  Even though it is a serious episode, the commentary is hilarious.  I was rolling on the floor.The main development in Season Two is the appearance of Sydney's presumed-dead mother.  Throughout the episodes, Sydney does not know whether or not to trust her mother.  Irina Derevko is played with hypnotic power by Lena Olin. Olin looks so much like her TV ""daughter,"" it is unsettling.The next main development is the budding romance between Sydney and Michael Vaughn, her CIA case handler.

Alias is a great example of the new adventure genre which combines heroes, heroines, conspiracy and wow gadgets and scenarios.

Her mother turns herself into the CIA, but will only deal with Sydney.  Now that Will knows the truth about what she does, she has someone to talk things over with, but he begins to get more involved in her life looking for a job.  Her relationship with her father continues to hit road blocks based on what she learns from her mother.  And she must hide her feelings for her CIA handler from everyone, including herself while continuing to work from the inside to take down SD-6.  Over there, someone is toying with Sloan, dropping hints that his wife might not really be dead.Confused yet?  It's only the beginning.  But that's a good thing.Season 1 of this show was outstanding, with multiple storylines effortlessly happening at once.  This season starts out at the top of its game as well, with more questions then answers and many twists to the plot.  I was disappointed with the twists half way through.  While the show is still great, it lost something for me at that point.  Simplifying wasn't necessarily better, in my opinion.  And I still am upset by what they did to Francie even though it's been over a year.  Of course, the acting continued to be top notch, and Lena Olin was absolutely outstanding joining the cast as Sydney's mother.Fans of the show will love this DVD set.  The entire second season is presented here in widescreen with surround sound.  As you'd expect from a recently filmed show, it looks and sounds outstanding.  The set includes 4 audio commentaries by various members of the cast and crew.  These are fun and informative, even if they do degrade a few times into self-love fests.  The bulk of the special features are on the final disc.  These include deleted scenes and a fun gag reel.  There is a 45 minute documentary on the making of the final episode of the season.  It covers ever aspect of the production from script to post, but more time seems to be spent on the final fight of the season then on any other aspect.  Still, it was fascinating.  The featurette on the look of Alias covers both seasons and is an interesting look at the wigs and costumes Sydney wears on her various missions.  There are only a few TV promos.  The four radio interviews are old news to us by now, but still interesting to listen to.While I was a little disappointed this season didn't quite measure up to season 1, they had an impossibly high goal to reach.  I still tuned in every week without fail, and couldn't wait to get my hands on this set.  Obviously, I'm still hopelessly hooked on this great TV show.

The series by this point needed a little bit of a spice knocked into it, and judging by the very last episode, we get it in season 3. (I own, but haven't seen seasons 3 & 4 yet.)I love all the different outfits & wigs that Jennifer wears in this, it's so funny! In the extras, you find out how they make the wigs etc, which is very interesting, and how some wigs don't work with Jennifer's face shape etc.I also loved the introduction of Jennifer & Michael Vartan's romance in this, which led to a real life relationship. But it doesn't last long. I also love the different way things pan out, especially with Sydney's mum (Lena Olin), and the doubles.Like season 1, there's also a few special guest stars, although nothing quite tops Quentin Tarantino in the first season. But this season, we do get the lovely Christian Slater, as a computer geek. Boy does he look like a geek too! But take away his razor, and I was drooling. He's terrific in this role as well, and looking very hot :(, and look out for the rat-like Ethan Hawke too.The last episode of course leaves you hanging, with both Francie & Will being killed (maybe), and Sydney's life getting turned upside down quite literally. If this doesn't make you put season 3 straight into the DVD player, I don't know what will.The extras are fabulous on this, the deleted scenes aren't up to much. (They're very obviously pointless, that they needed deleted.) But the blooper reel is hilarious, including an actor getting unintentionally hit in the face during a fight scene, and lots of giggles. This is probably the one & only time you'll get to see Jack Bristow (Victor Garber) laughing, and it's so funny, he's so serious during the series. There's also a very long, but very interesting behind the scenes on the last episode, showing viewers what exactly happens when you shoot an episode. (It takes them eight days per episode!!!) Also, you get to see how fine they cut it, when there's 5 days to airing the episode, and they're still recording the score for the episode.I hope for bigger & better things in season 3.

It was one of the sexiest and most action packed shows to come around in a long time. However, that is also why I had my doubts about season 2. When a show is that good right off the bat, it makes you think that the first season will be hard to top. That wasn't the case with the second season of Alias. It opens up with a bang, and the momentum never stops. You see everything from Sydney working with her mother ( who is supposed to be dead) and the fall of SD-6, to the start of Sydney and Vaughn's relationship.As a whole, Alias is a sleek, sexy, and action packed spy thriller that is guaranteed to leave you wanting more after each episode. The missions themselves provide for endless action, numerous close calls, and awesome fight sequenes. I also like how the show goes all over the world with the missions. With each mission, comes a new disguise for Sydney, and she looks good no matter what she dresses in!The acting is top notch. Not only is Jennifer Gardner extremely sexy, but she also provides for great acting and fighting scenes. Victor Garber is amazing s Sydney's dad. He is cold, calculating, and always looks out for himself. Ron Rifkin is amazing as Arvin Sloan, because even though he will make you despise him, he can also be extremely charming and likeable. Michael Vartan is great as Michael Vaughn. The sexual chemistry between him and Jennifer Garner is amazing, and it led to a real life relationship between the two of them. I must say though, one of the funniest and underrated characters on the show is Marshall the tech guy played by Kevin Weisman. Each week we get to see him demonstrate a new invention. The way that he does it will make you laugh. The show's best feature however, is the amount of outstanding cliffhangers. A good percentage of the episodes never have a clear cut ending and unfold slowly over the course of many episodes.Alias is the most exciting and action packed show that is on right now. The acting and different missions both seperate Alias from the rest. The extras for the season 2 Alias DVD set are great. My favorite feature is the gag-reel that shows many hilarious behind the scenes mishaps. There is also deleted scenes, featurettes, and much more.

What sort of idiot am I to have missed this on TV?Not only does this season dramatically improve upon an already impressive debut set, but it ranks among the best single seasons of television EVER.From the season opening reveal of her mom, to the season-ending &quot;two years?&quot; line, these 22 episodes had enough twists, turns, stunts, and action set pieces to keep you glued to your screen. Freakin' epoxy.In retrospect, I could not have handled having had to wait a week for each installment. I would have required medication.The acting is sublime. Jennifer Garner does WAY more than she has to; her Sydney will prove to be an all-time great TV heroine. Victor Garber is astonishing. If you really want to see what a character he's created, check out the gag reel on disc six. When he breaks character, it's as if he transforms back into Garber with a fingersnap. It's disarming.Ron Rifkin, as Sloane, continues his portrayal as one of the most continually interesting villains of modern times.And Lena Olin. What a casting coup. It's tragically cliche, but I could not for a moment take my eyes off of her.The rest of the cast is absolutely perfect. They seamlessly blend humor, pathos, tragedy, suspense, mystery, intrigue and old-fashioned Bondian shoot-em-ups. Marshall, to single out one character, is a delight.The relationship between Sydney and Vaughn developed into one of the great modern TV romances. It feels honest. True.

This simple fact is even more true of this, the second season of episodes, than it was of the first. That's what makes it so much fun to watch.J.J. Abrams and his crew keep you guessing in every episode of ""Alias.""  This show has the intelligence and production quality of some of the best thrillers that have appeared on the silver screen, and the consistency of quality and of storyline is nothing short of miraculous. The list of major talent that continue to appear in this show just grows and grows... in this season you'll see Ethan Hawke, Christian Slater, and Richard Lewis (among others) appearing in relatively short-term roles, while the talents of Victor Garber, Ron Rifkin, Lena Olin, and the incomparable Jennifer Garner continue to shine. And the talent behind the camera is no less notable; everything from the writing to the direction to the music is simply top-notch, especially by the standards of the vast majority of most network shows.It would be Wrong -- yes, with a capital W -- for me to give away any of the frequent plot twists and turns that you'll encounter in the second season of ""Alias."" I will tell you that you can't rely on the standard markers of a television season to tell you when to watch for ""something"" to happen. The final episode of the season is pretty climactic, to be sure, but no less so than one thing that happens midway through the season which changes the very nature of the show and everyone in it. Frankly, I've never seen this sort of transformation happen to a show in mid-season, but the way they pull it off in this season of ""Alias"" is nothing short of genius. And that's all I can tell you.  Sorry to be so secretive, but really, did you expect anything else?My advice to you is this: make sure you've already watched the first season of ""Alias"" because without that you'll be lost. Many important plot elements carry over from that season to this one. Once you've seen that, try to watch these 22 episodes with as few distractions as possible. Say something or blink at the wrong moment, and you're likely to miss some minor detail that will have a major effect 6 or 10 episodes down the line.

764272,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0000ALF8I,Robert Moore,"[10, 12]","Like many ALIAS fans, I have a slight preference for Season One, though only slight.  I think the show lost a bit of direction immediately following the destruction of the dreaded SD-6, and I continue to think that the killing of Frenchie and replacing her with Allison was a wretched mistake, but despite that, the show kept up the action, ratcheted up the plot tension, and maintained an exceptionally high level of writing and production.  One of the finest things of Season Two was the presence of Lena Olin as Sydney's mother.  Is there a more beautiful woman near the age of fifty on planet earth?  Tragically, Ms. Olin has declined to return to the show either as a regular either in Season Three or the upcoming Season Four.  One only hopes that she will change her mind.  She manages to imbue Irina Derevko with a host of both known and unknown qualities.  Even after an entire season of seeing her in action, we remains a profound mystery, despite our confidence that she really does love her daughter.Despite the couple of bumps mentioned above, the show hits on all eight cylinders all season long.  Many TV series relay on a fair amount of filler, but virtually every scene in ever episode either advances the story or provides scintillating action.  Although I still prefer BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (easily the major influence on the show as a whole--once could write a long review on the resemblances between the two shows) for its superior dialogue (indeed, with perhaps the exception of the first season of WEST WING, no show can rival BUFFY for its talk) and perpetual focus on human emotion rather than action (in BUFFY, the action is always subservient to the emotions, while in ALIAS the action often takes on a life of its own), I would be willing to argue that ALIAS is perhaps the finest action show of all time.  By the way, another parallel between BUFFY and ALIAS is that technology functions in ALIAS the exact same way that magic does in BUFFY:  when introduced, regardless of how unexplained or improbable the magic or technology is, the purpose is to advance the plot.The members of the cast shine even brighter in Season Two, as they all seem to become comfortable in their roles.  What is amazing is that no one seems to flag or encounter dead spots, regardless of the demands made upon him or her.  The guest stars are simply outstanding, as well as being far better known than is typical in a television series.  Amy Irving, Quentin Tarantino, Christian Slater, Ethan Hawke, and many others all enhance an already outstanding cast.  Tarantino in particular is absolutely perfect for the show, and one regrets that his other activities stands in the way of his being a more persistent presence in the show.  He will return, thankfully, in Season Three.All in all, ALIAS remains a refreshing exception to the usual TV fare, a happy alternative to the endless procedural cop shows.  Although showing on ABC, one would swear that it was a FOX creation, though since FOX cancels most of its best shows before they get off the ground (e.g., FIREFLY, WONDERFALLS).  It remains edgy, original, and very, very slick, and one of the very few shows on TV worth paying attention to.",5,No sophomore slump for ALIAS,1092960000,"08 20, 2004",2004,3205,"['many', 'ALIAS', 'fans', 'have', 'slight', 'preference', 'Season', 'One', 'only', 'slight', 'think', 'show', 'lost', 'bit', 'direction', 'immediately', 'following', 'destruction', 'dreaded', 'SD-6', 'continue', 'think', 'killing', 'Frenchie', 'replacing', 'Allison', 'was', 'wretched', 'mistake', 'show', 'kept', 'up', 'action', 'ratcheted', 'up', 'plot', 'tension', 'maintained', 'exceptionally', 'high', 'level', 'writing', 'production', 'One', 'finest', 'things', 'Season', 'Two', 'was', 'presence', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'Sydney', 'mother', 'more', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'age', 'fifty', 'planet', 'earth', 'Tragically', 'Ms.', 'Olin', 'declined', 'return', 'show', 'either', 'regular', 'either', 'Season', 'Three', 'upcoming', 'Season', 'Four', 'One', 'only', 'will', 'change', 'mind', 'imbue', 'Irina', 'Derevko', 'host', 'known', 'unknown', 'qualities', 'Even', 'entire', 'season', 'seeing', 'action', 'profound', 'mystery', 'confidence', 'really', 'love', 'daughter.Despite', 'couple', 'bumps', 'mentioned', 'show', 'eight', 'cylinders', 'season', 'long', 'Many', 'TV', 'series', 'relay', 'fair', 'amount', 'filler', 'virtually', 'scene', 'ever', 'episode', 'story', 'scintillating', 'action', 'still', 'prefer', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'easily', 'major', 'influence', 'show', 'whole', 'once', 'could', 'write', 'long', 'review', 'resemblances', 'two', 'shows', 'superior', 'dialogue', 'indeed', 'perhaps', 'exception', 'first', 'season', 'WEST', 'WING', 'show', 'can', 'rival', 'BUFFY', 'talk', 'perpetual', 'focus', 'human', 'emotion', 'rather', 'action', 'BUFFY', 'action', 'always', 'subservient', 'emotions', 'ALIAS', 'action', 'often', 'life', 'own', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'argue', 'ALIAS', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'action', 'show', 'time', 'way', 'parallel', 'BUFFY', 'ALIAS', 'technology', 'functions', 'ALIAS', 'exact', 'same', 'way', 'magic', 'BUFFY', 'when', 'introduced', 'regardless', 'how', 'unexplained', 'improbable', 'magic', 'technology', 'purpose', 'advance', 'plot.The', 'members', 'cast', 'shine', 'even', 'brighter', 'Season', 'Two', 'seem', 'become', 'comfortable', 'roles', 'What', 'amazing', 'one', 'flag', 'encounter', 'dead', 'spots', 'regardless', 'demands', 'made', 'guest', 'stars', 'are', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'far', 'better', 'known', 'typical', 'television', 'series', 'Amy', 'Irving', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'many', 'others', 'enhance', 'already', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'Tarantino', 'particular', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'show', 'one', 'regrets', 'other', 'activities', 'way', 'being', 'more', 'persistent', 'presence', 'show', 'will', 'return', 'thankfully', 'Season', 'Three.All', 'ALIAS', 'refreshing', 'exception', 'usual', 'TV', 'fare', 'happy', 'alternative', 'endless', 'procedural', 'cop', 'shows', 'showing', 'ABC', 'one', 'would', 'swear', 'was', 'FOX', 'creation', 'FOX', 'most', 'best', 'shows', 'get', 'ground', 'e.g.', 'FIREFLY', 'WONDERFALLS', 'edgy', 'original', 'very', 'very', 'slick', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'shows', 'TV', 'worth', 'paying', 'attention']",N/A

764274,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B0000ALF8I,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 2]","Last Year...on a very special ""Alias"":Sydney Bristow, a young woman working on her PHd while working part-time at Credit Dauphine, leads a double life as a secret agent for SD-6 - purportedly a deep-cover branch of the CIA, but really a faction of ""The Alliance"", a global-network of arch-criminals who make hundreds of millions in arms sales, extortion and murder.  Warned by her father when SD-6 murders her fianc&eacute; and then marks her for death, Sydney ""defects"" to the CIA, and becomes their double-agent.  Now Sydney conducts compound missions - operations for SD-6 which are really counter-missions for the CIA intended to bring SD-6 down.  Her only ally in SD-6 is her father, Jack Bristow, one of the few who knows the truth about the organization and its chief - the evil Arvin Sloane.  Sydney must navigate the tight channels between SD-6 and its rivals (other evil organizations, security operatives of the alliance obsessed with uncovering moles, etc.) and not infrequently other functionaries of the US Government.  In season 1, Syd faced several complications: the workings of a renaissance-era inventor named Rambaldi whose writings and inventions border on the prophetic and the apocalyptic, the shifting (and often selfish) loyalties of her homicidal father, the meddling of her reporter-friend Will Tippen and the truth about her mother, Laura Bristow (AKA KGB agent Irina Derevko, AKA ""the Man""). (MadTV spoofed this show with a rapid fire skit that parodied the many tangled webs of Sydney Bristow's life - the biggest joke is how much of the material was accurate.)If that sounds like a lot, it is, especially since many of the episodes resolve around the same basic idea: a mission that involves Sydney sneaking into a highly-secured location in disguise, break into a secure vault or hack a computer using exotic technology, grab the goods, kick-box her way out.  Rinse and repeat.  Nevertheless, the show manages to work its plot twists in how these missions connect - a mission goes bad, and somebody's captured, is he worth the risk?; a mission goes too well, and SD-6 gets the goods before Sydney can get them to the CIA; and just how good is this intel anyway?  Brisk action keeps each episode going - also keeping us from wondering how SD-6's agents (presumably about as competent as Sydney, multilingual, combat-trained, techno-savvy and just so generally brilliant in so many other areas) never learn of SD-6's true nature while out in the field.Tonight, on ALIAS!!Everybody's loyalties are strained to the breaking point.  It begins with mom - Laura Bristow (referred almost all the time as ""Derevko"") revealing herself as ""The Man"", the shadowy head of an organization with a murderous efficiency rivaling that of SD-6.  Surrendering herself to the CIA (""The Enemy Walks In"") she proves in every way the perfect match for Jack Bristow.  Can she be trusted?  Sydney is torn, but her father is not - making us wonder how far he'll go to discredit her.  And what will happen when the Bristows take a family trip (hunting for WMD's in Kashmir)?  Meanwhile, Will Tippen's investigation into last season's murder of Sydney's fianc&eacute; causes him to be sucked into the world of international espionage.  In order to ensure his promotion into the Alliance, the evil Arvin Sloane must execute his wife, Emily.  (Dying of cancer, Emily blabs what she knows about SD-6 to Syd, and then inconveniently goes into remission.)  When Sloane receives hints that Emily may be alive, he slowly goes off his hinges - or is it something else?  Season 2 gives more attention & action to characters given the side-order treatment last year, including Dixon, Marshall and even Asst. Director Kendall (Terry O'Quinn - YES!!!).""Alias"" is a lot of fun even though it's also dated - having less in common with shows like ""Lost"", ""Heroes"" and the new BSG than the shows replaced by them (any of the reincarnations of ""Star Trek"").  ""Alias"" isn't about ordinary people in extraordinary situations; nor will we find Syd in a situation where her only hope is a tenacity she's not supposed to have.  And most graying of all, we never doubt that Syd's targets have it coming - they're all bad-guys, and the only bad consequences of Sydney's actions are further missions.  For all the murkiness about SD-6 or any pretension about how we're too modern to simplify the world into goodguys and badguys, once Syd's stilettos go into action, we need not worry that she's going after a totally innocent dude, or that the measures (or wardrobe) taken aren't overly extreme.  ""Alias"" is about as obsolete as a show can be, but it gives the spy-fi genre a great treatment, with larger-than-life (and meaner) characters, enigmatic loyalties and some beguiling questions.STUFF THAT ALMOST KEPT US FROM TUNING IN:No show is perfect, though ""Alias"" has some quirks which nearly abuse the privilege.  Needless celebrity guests (since they're stars, the show can't do that much to them or with them), too much important dialog spoken in quick and hushed tones, too much info spoken straight out (""subtext"" anyone?), too much gratuitous footage of Jennifer Garner's bod or of Syd in suggestive clothing (Yes, we know she's mega-hot, but that doesn't mean we should be treated like we're a bunch of stalkers) and too many artificially-emotional scenes with extra-sappy music playing in the background (if you're wife is a bigger fan of ""Grey's Anatomy"" or ""October Road"" than you are, you know what I'm talking about).That aside, ""Alias"" is still a fun ride that sends the spy-thriller genre out with a bang.  Lena Olin is coolly sexy as the evil/motherly Derevko, while Victor Garber and Terry O'Quinn vie for the title of ""CIA's meanest"", while Ron Rifkind chews up the scenery as an archvillain in an age where such men are thought extinct.  The show is like one of Sydney's disguises, a sheath of artifice over a compelling and inescapable reality.",4,Love it; Hate it; I've just got to have more Alias,1199923200,"01 10,

You really can't wait for the next episode. Fortunately, we have this on DVD now, otherwise I can't imagine how I would survive between the episodes. The success of the first season was compounded by mostly good acting by not very famous (then) actors. Second season brought more famous actors. Some of them, such as Christian Slater, have brief appearance and some, such as Lena Olin, play major part. I just loved Lena Olin as mother of Sidney Bristow. There is this great chemistry between her and Jennifer Garner. The mistery, surrounding her, keeps you guessing until the end of the season.

When we last left CIA double agent Sydney (Jennifer Garner), she discovered that her own mother ( the subtle Lena Olen) wasn't dead but was the head of an evil organization that uses black mail and extortion to achieve wealth and world domination.Sloan ( the oily Ron Rifkin) the head of the evil faux CIA agency SD-6 that Sydney is spying on with her father (the marvelous Victor Garber) suspects Sydney is a double agent (for the umpteenth time). After murdering his terminally ill wife, Sloan believes his rivals are trying to drive him insane when he gets a mysterious call from his wife's favorite bed and breakfast. When he discovers her dying garden in full bloom he knows someone's trying to ship him out on the next train to Wackyland.  To top off a horrible week for Sydney, one of her best friends is almost assassinated and her CIA handler disappears during a joint mission. Have you caught your breath? That was just the first three episodes of the second season. The manic pace of this series will keep your brain nimble even as your body becomes as round as a potato.Alias manages to combine elements of the original television series Mission: Impossible, Alfred Hitchcock's suspense films,  the cult series The Prisoner, Felicity  and The X-Files in a series of entertaining (and occasionally absurd) story arcs. Series creator/producer J. J. Abrams has created a series of multilayered stories that continue to keep the audience guessing. It may not be great ""drama"" but it's great spy opera. Jennifer Garner runs from one emotional extreme to another all within the same episode making the series a rollercoaster ride for fans.Thankfully the McGuffin (a reference to a tool used by Hitchcock in his suspense films. A McGuffin is a story device that moves the drama forward and that's very important to the characters but not clearly defined for the audience) of the first season the Rimbaldi Prophecy doesn't dominate the second season quite as much. While the Rimbaldi Prophecy and all the pieces of that puzzle were interesting, they had become somewhat absurd by the end of the first season. Abram's in his reach to create a mythology as complex as The X-Files exceeded his grasp. While it does figure prominently in the second season, it's less of a driving force than the character relationships and double crosses.The Complete Second Season has all 22 episodes that aired last year plus some nice extras. The picture quality is very good considering how much data is included on each disc (roughly 5 1/2 hours each). There's some minor compression artifacts but the picture is clean of analog flaws. The  Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround is faithfully reproduced and has far more depth than the episodes run on ABC.The extras are surprisingly good considering the price of the set. There's a featurette on the making of ""The Telling"" , one on the look of the series, as well as a glimpse at the video game . The blooper reel allows an inside glimpse into the series and reminds us that to paraphrase Hitchcock, it's only a television show. Audio commentary from the cast and crew features prominently on four of the more important episodes. I really haven't had a chance to spent much time with the DVD-Rom Scriptscanner but based on the glimpse I did take, it provides a nice companion and comparison piece to the series..Extra points go to Touchstone for the nicely packaged second season. 2 discs are in each snap case and the cardboard holder somes with a plastic sleeve that makes it look very classy. A few demerits for the annoying Disney habit of force feeding previews to the audience. I find this form of advertising offensive and it's been taken to absurd new heights on the Universal DVDs where you have to watch the advertisements before reaching the main menu. At least Disney does offer the option of skipping the previews (but you have to choose menu as the disc begins) so you can move on to the episode you want to watch.""Alias: The Second Season"" is an exceptional boxed set for fans. What's fun about seeing this again so soon after the third season is the chance to look back at the carefully planned story arcs. If you haven't seen the first season of the show, I would recommend renting/purchasing the boxed set before moving forward to season two. Although Abrams and the series writers do a good job of summarizing important plot points from season one, there's quite a bit to be missed if you come in on the middle of this story.",4,Nimble thriller keeps you guessing 4 1/2 stars,1072828800,"12 31, 2003",2003,4547,"['know', 'bad', 'day', 'when', 'Mom', 'shoots', 'prelude', 'torture', 'When', 'last', 'left', 'CIA', 'double', 'agent', 'Sydney', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'discovered', 'own', 'mother', 'subtle', 'Lena', 'Olen', 'was', ""n't"", 'dead', 'was', 'head', 'evil', 'organization', 'black', 'mail', 'extortion', 'achieve', 'wealth', 'world', 'domination.Sloan', 'oily', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', 'head', 'evil', 'faux', 'CIA', 'agency', 'SD-6', 'Sydney', 'spying', 'father', 'marvelous', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'Sydney', 'double', 'agent', 'umpteenth', 'time', 'murdering', 'terminally', 'ill', 'wife', 'Sloan', 'rivals', 'are', 'trying', 'drive', 'insane', 'when', 'mysterious', 'call', 'wife', 'favorite', 'bed', 'breakfast', 'When', 'dying', 'garden', 'full', 'bloom', 'someone', 'trying', 'ship', 'out', 'next', 'train', 'Wackyland', 'top', 'off', 'horrible', 'week', 'Sydney', 'one', 'best', 'friends', 'almost', 'assassinated', 'CIA', 'handler', 'joint', 'mission', 'Have', 'caught', 'breath', 'was', 'just', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'manic', 'pace', 'series', 'will', 'keep', 'brain', 'nimble', 'even', 'body', 'as', 'round', 'potato.Alias', 'combine', 'elements', 'original', 'television', 'series', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'suspense', 'films', 'cult', 'series', 'Prisoner', 'Felicity', 'X-Files', 'series', 'entertaining', 'occasionally', 'absurd', 'story', 'arcs', 'Series', 'creator/producer', 'J.', 'J.', 'Abrams', 'created', 'series', 'multilayered', 'stories', 'continue', 'keep', 'audience', 'guessing', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'drama', 'great', 'spy', 'opera', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'one', 'emotional', 'extreme', 'same', 'episode', 'making', 'series', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'fans.Thankfully', 'McGuffin', 'reference', 'tool', 'used', 'Hitchcock', 'suspense', 'films', 'McGuffin', 'story', 'device', 'drama', 'forward', 'very', 'important', 'characters', 'not', 'clearly', 'defined', 'audience', 'first', 'season', 'Rimbaldi', 'Prophecy', ""n't"", 'dominate', 'second', 'season', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'Rimbaldi', 'Prophecy', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'were', 'interesting', 'had', 'become', 'somewhat', 'absurd', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'Abram', 'reach', 'create', 'mythology', 'as', 'complex', 'X-Files', 'exceeded', 'grasp', 'figure', 'prominently', 'second', 'season', 'less', 'driving', 'force', 'character', 'relationships', 'double', 'crosses.The', 'Complete', 'Second', 'Season', '22', 'episodes', 'aired', 'last', 'year', 'nice', 'extras', 'picture', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'considering', 'how', 'much', 'data', 'included', 'disc', 'roughly', '5', '1/2', 'hours', 'minor', 'compression', 'artifacts', 'picture', 'clean', 'analog', 'flaws', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'Surround', 'faithfully', 'reproduced', 'far', 'more', 'depth', 'episodes', 'run', 'ABC.The', 'extras', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'considering', 'price', 'set', 'featurette', 'making', 'Telling', 'one', 'look', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'glimpse', 'video', 'game', 'blooper', 'reel', 'inside', 'glimpse', 'series', 'paraphrase', 'Hitchcock', 'only', 'television', 'show', 'Audio', 'commentary', 'cast', 'crew', 'features', 'prominently', 'four', 'more', 'important', 'episodes', 'really', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'chance', 'spent', 'much', 'time', 'DVD-Rom', 'Scriptscanner', 'based', 'glimpse', 'did', 'take', 'nice', 'companion', 'comparison', 'piece', 'series..Extra', 'points', 'go', 'Touchstone', 'nicely', 'packaged', 'second', 'season', '2', 'discs', 'are', 'snap', 'case', 'cardboard', 'holder', 'somes', 'plastic', 'sleeve', 'look', 'very', 'classy', 'few', 'demerits', 'annoying', 'Disney', 'habit', 'force', 'feeding', 'previews', 'audience', 'find', 'form', 'advertising', 'offensive', 'been', 'taken', 'absurd', 'new', 'heights', 'Universal', 'DVDs', 'where', 'have', 'watch', 'advertisements', 'reaching', 'main', 'menu', 'least', 'Disney', 'offer', 'option', 'skipping', 'previews', 'have', 'choose', 'menu', 'disc', 'can', 'move', 'episode', 'want', 'watch', 'Alias', 'Second', 'Season', 'exceptional', 'boxed', 'set', 'fans', 'What', 'fun', 'seeing', 'again', 'so', 'soon', 'third', 'season', 'chance', 'look', 'back', 'carefully', 'planned', 'story', 'arcs', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'would', 'recommend', 'renting/purchasing', 'boxed', 'set', 'moving', 'forward', 'season', 'two', 'Abrams', 'series', 'writers', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'summarizing', 'important', 'plot', 'points', 'season', 'one', 'quite', 'bit', 'be', 'missed', 'come', 'middle', 'story']",N/A

764292,A3Q4XAQXKKV6V,B0000ALF8I,William Smith,"[2, 3]","I really need to put my credentials on the table to let you know where I'm coming from; I HATE ""NEWER"" TELEVISION. I have tried all the various forms; CSI this, NYPD that, they all leave me with a cold generic feeling. The characters by and large just do not seem like real people to me. I am always conscious I'm watching ""tv"". Now maybe it's too much to expect NOT TO however, being a fan of older TV I genuinely believe the characters from my olders shows ""exist"" in the world created. I'm a fan of many of the older shows; Columbo, All in the Family, Star Trek, etc., they just have genuine qualities I no longer find in tv.Enter Netflix and Alias.A friend loaned me ""Electra"", and I really liked Jen Garner, and from there I Netflixed Season One-Disc One of ""Alias"" (and almost DIDN'T!). Little did I know that would change how I view television... forever? From there I bought Season One and devoured it... whole. Then I bought Season Two, gave it a week and dove deep. I just watched ""Phase One"" Ep. 13 from S2 and was moved enough to write a review. I was struck with the realization that this may be the best show I have ever seen. How can it BE? I GREW UP with all my faves, surely nothing can overpower nostalgia... can IT? I think it can.Alias: Season Two simply put is the quality of a big budget movie, every time out, with the familiarity of a close knit family. Each and every character has a purpose and each plot point leads to something bigger that is totally believeable, completely unexpected, but no less mind-blowing. Besides all that this series is without a doubt the most addictive television show ever created, it's definitely becoming unhealty:)So, what now?Well, I guess I still have half of a Season to get back to and sadly the ""buzz"" is that Seasons 3 and 4 fall short. While I do have this in the back of my mind I also remember hearing ""Millennium"" Season 3 was the worst and it was every bit as good as Season 2, so sometimes the buzz just needs to be swatted:)",5,"When terms like ""stunning"" are comically inadequate",1144368000,"04 7, 2006",2006,1996,"['really', 'need', 'put', 'credentials', 'table', 'let', 'know', 'where', ""'m"", 'coming', 'HATE', 'NEWER', 'TELEVISION', 'have', 'tried', 'various', 'forms', 'CSI', 'NYPD', 'leave', 'cold', 'generic', 'feeling', 'characters', 'large', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'real', 'people', 'am', 'always', 'conscious', ""'m"", 'watching', 'tv', 'Now', 'too', 'much', 'expect', 'NOT', 'TO', 'however', 'being', 'fan', 'older', 'TV', 'genuinely', 'believe', 'characters', 'olders', 'exist', 'world', 'created', ""'m"", 'fan', 'many', 'older', 'Columbo', 'All', 'Family', 'Star', 'Trek', 'etc.', 'just', 'have', 'genuine', 'qualities', 'no', 'longer', 'find', 'tv.Enter', 'Netflix', 'Alias.A', 'friend', 'loaned', 'Electra', 'really', 'liked', 'Jen', 'Garner', 'Netflixed', 'Season', 'One-Disc', 'One', 'Alias', 'almost', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'Little', 'did', 'know', 'would', 'change', 'how', 'view', 'television', 'forever', 'bought', 'Season', 'One', 'devoured', 'whole', 'Then', 'bought', 'Season', 'Two', 'gave', 'week', 'dove', 'deep', 'just', 'watched', 'Phase', 'One', 'Ep', '13', 'S2', 'was', 'moved', 'enough', 'write', 'review', 'was', 'struck', 'realization', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'show', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'How', 'can', 'BE', 'GREW', 'UP', 'faves', 'surely', 'nothing', 'can', 'overpower', 'nostalgia', 'can', 'IT', 'think', 'Season', 'Two', 'simply', 'put', 'quality', 'big', 'budget', 'movie', 'time', 'out', 'familiarity', 'close', 'knit', 'family', 'character', 'purpose', 'plot', 'point', 'something', 'bigger', 'totally', 'believeable', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'less', 'mind-blowing', 'series', 'doubt', 'most', 'addictive', 'television', 'show', 'ever', 'created', 'definitely', 'becoming', 'unhealty', 'So', 'what', 'now', 'Well', 'guess', 'still', 'have', 'half', 'Season', 'get', 'back', 'sadly', 'buzz', 'Seasons', '3', '4', 'fall', 'short', 'do', 'have', 'back', 'mind', 'also', 'remember', 'hearing', 'Millennium', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'worst', 'was', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'Season', '2', 'so', 'sometimes', 'buzz', 'just', 'be', 'swatted']",N/A
