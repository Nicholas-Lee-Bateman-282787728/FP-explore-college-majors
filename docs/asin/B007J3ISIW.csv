1531723,A3UZQ1IW3XUZ73,B007J3ISIW,"B. Cathey ""ParsifalCSA""","[14, 15]","Edmond O'Brien made several fine Westerns for Paramount Pictures prior to his epochal role in THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE. DENVER & RIO GRANDE may be his best outing until that 1962 classic. Starring O'Brien and Sterling Hayden, DENVER & RIO GRANDE is a classic railroad film, one of the best ever made, with a spectacular crash that even today is considered amazing. The film is beautifully shot in Technicolor, with an excellent cast, solid plot and action, and great production values. Although Paramount Pictures tended to make fewer Westerns than other studios in the 1950s, the ones it did make---with Charlton Heston, Alan Ladd, John Payne, and O'Brien---were always superior, no expense spared.  DENVER & RIO GRANDE is very entertaining and repays re-watching.Olive Films has been licensing and releasing a number of Paramount Westerns, including SILVER CITY (with O'Brien), PONY EXPRESS (with Heston), THE JAYHAWKERS (with Jeff Chandler and Fess Parker), RUN FOR COVER (Jimmy Cagney' best of his three Westerns), THE NIGHT OF THE GRIZZLY (with Fess Parker) and THE HANGMAN (with Robert Taylor). Let's hope that this very fine series of releases will continue with such excellent Westerns as WARPATH (also with O'Brien) and FLAMING FEATHER (with Sterling Hayden), both superior entertainment and in need of the professional release that Olive Films can give them.Highly recommended.",5,Excellent Paramount Western,1339113600,"06 8, 2012",2012,1395,"['Edmond', ""O'Brien"", 'made', 'several', 'fine', 'Westerns', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'prior', 'epochal', 'role', 'THE', 'MAN', 'WHO', 'SHOT', 'LIBERTY', 'VALANCE', 'DENVER', 'RIO', 'GRANDE', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'outing', '1962', 'classic', 'Starring', ""O'Brien"", 'Sterling', 'Hayden', 'DENVER', 'RIO', 'GRANDE', 'classic', 'railroad', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'made', 'spectacular', 'crash', 'even', 'today', 'considered', 'amazing', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'Technicolor', 'excellent', 'cast', 'solid', 'plot', 'action', 'great', 'production', 'values', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'tended', 'make', 'fewer', 'Westerns', 'other', 'studios', '1950s', 'ones', 'did', 'make', '-with', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Alan', 'Ladd', 'John', 'Payne', ""O'Brien"", '-were', 'always', 'superior', 'expense', 'spared', 'DENVER', 'RIO', 'GRANDE', 'very', 'entertaining', 're-watching.Olive', 'Films', 'been', 'licensing', 'releasing', 'number', 'Paramount', 'Westerns', 'including', 'SILVER', 'CITY', ""O'Brien"", 'PONY', 'EXPRESS', 'Heston', 'JAYHAWKERS', 'Jeff', 'Chandler', 'Fess', 'Parker', 'RUN', 'FOR', 'COVER', 'Jimmy', 'Cagney', 'best', 'three', 'Westerns', 'THE', 'NIGHT', 'THE', 'GRIZZLY', 'Fess', 'Parker', 'THE', 'HANGMAN', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'Let', 'hope', 'very', 'fine', 'series', 'releases', 'will', 'continue', 'such', 'excellent', 'Westerns', 'WARPATH', 'also', ""O'Brien"", 'FLAMING', 'FEATHER', 'Sterling', 'Hayden', 'superior', 'entertainment', 'need', 'professional', 'release', 'Olive', 'Films', 'can', 'give', 'them.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

1531727,A60PQSFWSQK8K,B007J3ISIW,Erik Rupp,"[3, 4]","Edmond O'Brien was always good.  At his worst he was good, at his best he was great.  In Denver & Rio Grande he's somewhere in the middle.  The movie, directed by Byron Haskin, is always entertaining, and always holds your attention.  It's got a fair amount of action, and that's well played.  It also has a solid plot and some good characters.  The cast is good from top to bottom, and the location footage is really nice.Olive Films' Blu Ray release of Denver & Rio Grande is solid as well.  There are a few shots that are soft, but most of them are fairly crisp and clean.  There are a few instances where there is a lot of dust and debris on the print, but that doesn't happen too often.  This is a solid encoding of a good (but not great) print.  Both the picture and sound are very good for a film from 1952.If you like Westerns or movies about railroads do not hesitate to buy this blu ray.  It's a fun movie and a very good blu ray release.",4,Solid Early 50's Railroad Western,1341878400,"07 10, 2012",2012,948,"['Edmond', ""O'Brien"", 'was', 'always', 'good', 'worst', 'was', 'good', 'best', 'was', 'great', 'Denver', 'Rio', 'Grande', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'movie', 'directed', 'Byron', 'Haskin', 'always', 'entertaining', 'always', 'attention', 'got', 'fair', 'amount', 'action', 'well', 'played', 'also', 'solid', 'plot', 'good', 'characters', 'cast', 'good', 'top', 'bottom', 'location', 'footage', 'really', 'nice.Olive', 'Films', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'release', 'Denver', 'Rio', 'Grande', 'solid', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'few', 'shots', 'are', 'soft', 'most', 'are', 'fairly', 'crisp', 'clean', 'are', 'few', 'instances', 'where', 'lot', 'dust', 'debris', 'print', ""n't"", 'happen', 'too', 'often', 'solid', 'encoding', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'print', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'film', '1952.If', 'Westerns', 'movies', 'railroads', 'do', 'not', 'hesitate', 'buy', 'blu', 'ray', 'fun', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'blu', 'ray', 'release']",N/A
