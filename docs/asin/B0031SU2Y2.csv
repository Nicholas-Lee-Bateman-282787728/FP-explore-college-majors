1317805,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B0031SU2Y2,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[3, 5]","There is tense as the opening is about the method, stress, and danger  of  the desire to smuggle into Europe.  Bilal is an athletic 17 year old from Turkey, and his mission is cross into Europe to be with a girl he loves, and whose family is set against this union.  But being caught forces him to walk to Europe 4,000 kilometers that took 3 months.He intends to swim the English Channel, 10 hours into the icy waters, where his beloved family is now located.  Bilal meets a gold-medal swimming champ turned failure, turned instructor, Simon, who trains him to swim.  Simon lets Bilal and a friend stay at his home and lives in threat of being reported by his neighbors for harboring the immigrants.  Simon, in the midst of a divorce, takes the risk to harbor the immigrants in an attempt to win his wife back prior to a divorce.Director Philippe Lioret had the idea for the movie learning about people who flee their homes at all costs and they followed non-profit organizations who help these people.  The drama is based on a story of a young immigrant who does want to swim the English chanel.  Director Lioret has learned about the very young people who leave their homeland, and the people who help them.  This film has won numerous awards.Although the film is slow for some, its drama is told within the conflicts of loving, leaving, success, failure, hope and dreams. The soundtrack is minimal, acting is impressive.  The French film, released in 2009, is a Film Movement selection.  Film Movement brings to viewers around the country, quality filming, great stories, good directing!  ......Rizzo",4,The plight of the immigrant and those who help; their personal stories that drive the actions,1285718400,"09 29, 2010",2010,1603,"['tense', 'opening', 'method', 'stress', 'danger', 'desire', 'smuggle', 'Europe', 'Bilal', 'athletic', '17', 'year', 'old', 'Turkey', 'mission', 'cross', 'Europe', 'be', 'girl', 'family', 'set', 'union', 'being', 'caught', 'forces', 'walk', 'Europe', '4,000', 'kilometers', 'took', '3', 'months.He', 'swim', 'English', 'Channel', '10', 'hours', 'icy', 'waters', 'where', 'beloved', 'family', 'now', 'located', 'Bilal', 'gold-medal', 'swimming', 'champ', 'turned', 'failure', 'turned', 'instructor', 'Simon', 'who', 'swim', 'Simon', 'Bilal', 'friend', 'stay', 'home', 'lives', 'threat', 'being', 'reported', 'neighbors', 'harboring', 'immigrants', 'Simon', 'midst', 'divorce', 'risk', 'harbor', 'immigrants', 'attempt', 'win', 'wife', 'back', 'prior', 'divorce.Director', 'Philippe', 'Lioret', 'had', 'idea', 'movie', 'learning', 'people', 'who', 'flee', 'homes', 'costs', 'followed', 'non-profit', 'organizations', 'who', 'help', 'people', 'drama', 'based', 'story', 'young', 'immigrant', 'who', 'want', 'swim', 'English', 'chanel', 'Director', 'Lioret', 'learned', 'very', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'leave', 'homeland', 'people', 'who', 'help', 'film', 'won', 'numerous', 'film', 'slow', 'drama', 'told', 'conflicts', 'loving', 'leaving', 'success', 'failure', 'hope', 'dreams', 'soundtrack', 'minimal', 'acting', 'impressive', 'French', 'film', 'released', '2009', 'Film', 'Movement', 'selection', 'Film', 'Movement', 'viewers', 'country', 'quality', 'filming', 'great', 'stories', 'good', 'directing', 'Rizzo']",N/A
1317806,A27QKI9K6RKFIT,B0031SU2Y2,"CARLOS ROMERO ""&#34;natural cinephile&#34;""","[1, 2]","This is another excellent and moving film from Philippe Lioret. Just when you think the world is lacking in compassion for our fellow human beings (even in the Arts) along comes one of those rare films to change your mind. ""Welcome"" from 2009 by Philippe Lioret (""Mademoiselle"" 2000) was about the plight of immigrants (in this case Kurds from northern Iraq) that were left in a kind of no man's land in Calais, France (the shortest route across the channel to England). And who were trying desperately to make the crossing. As there are already some excellent reviews describing this thought-provoking film, I would like to take this opportunity to set the record straight for all the xenophobes of the world!Immigration whether you like it or not, is a side effect of the impoverishment of most of the inhabitants on this planet by the actions of the very wealthy (U.S. EU, Japan, and to a lesser degree even Russia and China are in on it). With their so-called - 'free trade' and 'foreign aid' (most of these are conditional loans: appropriated by the IMF and World Bank, where the lender nation actually gets back tenfold on its investment: i.e. - minerals and raw materials, slave-labor, etc., etc. And is an assured way of propping-up their sponsored regimes too). The Global Powers (U.S. and Co.) are then able to dictate internal policy in the borrower nations. The borrower nations then become recipients (customers) of the MIC and the multinational-corps. (So where does the money really end-up, follow the money-trail.) In 1968, Al-Bakr and Saddam Hussein of Iraq, were 'sponsored' and placed in power with the highest blessings of the Oil Cartel (known in those days; as the 'Seven Sisters'), and with the full support of the CIA and the Nixon Administration the following year. So was Quadaffi for that matter (he was sponsored by Armand Hammer's: Occidental Petroleum - that got a big oil concession from Lybia and Col. Quadaffi as a result). Why would the 'bastion of freedom' (U.S.) lend its support to dictators and terrorists? There is no such thing as illegal immigration (this is by design). Most of these poor people are made to come here/there by the forces of capital (the ruling elite in the U.S. and Europe who support the entrenched oligarchs of the Third World). This is done to supply us/them with a slave-labor force, thus driving down wages here/there. They then use this as a political tool (the government loves the fact that Americans are some of the most bigoted and uneducated people in the world), for people like our drone down there (negative reviewer), who has no concept of reality! When are people in the U.S. going to learn and understand what really goes on in this world. The U.S. and every other rich nation for that matter, do not give money away ever. For free, are you nuts!! I've travelled to so many places and am completely shocked by how much more they know about the state of affairs of the world compared to people here. Have some compassion for crying out loud! Ask yourself, how and why did my ancestors come here? A: same reason, for a better way of life (of course, this is no longer the case!). Remember, these people did not want to leave their countries, they were forced to flee, by poverty and political instability created with the help of our own government!

This is possibly illegal here in the USA, but I'll bet it's not enforced. In France, however, it seems like it is.I learned this by watching Welcome, a film that in France ignited much debate about the laws against helping illegals. The movie tells the story of Bilal (the extremely attractive Firat Ayverdi), a seventeen-year-old Kurdish boy who wants to get to England to be with the girl he loves. When his first plan to go across the Channel inside a truck fails, he falls back onto another plan to swim across. He finds Simon (Vincent Lindon), a former Olympic gold medalist swimmer and starts taking lessons so that he can swim to England and be with the girl he loves.Now I've written before on my blog about how insanely stupid teenage love is, and this is a great example. Here's this kid who thinks he's in love with this girl and is willing to risk his life to be with her. Some people consider this wonderful and romantic. Not I. He'd have been far better off staying in France, since the French state they have no plans to deport him back to Iraq and especially since there seems to be at least some chance of normalizing his status. But, no, he's young, stupid and willing to risk death. These kids today...Of course had he stayed in France we wouldn't have had a movie, and what a good movie it is. We see the plight of illegals in France, something I'm fairly close to myself living in Arizona. We handle it poorly, but they really have raised their bad treatment of illegals to an art form. We also get some wonderful side-stories about Simon's life and his recent divorce, and much about the way the police treat and investigate the illegals.It was quite clear that Philippe Lioret, the director, had a definite agenda and the movie does suffer somewhat on an artistic level because of it. As a result, the ending wasn't what I had hoped for, being a bit of a disappointment. It was more realistic than what I had wanted, but that doesn't mean I like it. It's a very good film and I'm glad I saw it.== SHORT SUBJECT ==This month's short film is called The Berlin Wall. It's about an older man whose wife dies. He goes a little iffy at that point and winds up building up a segment of a wall in a field near his apartment. Some neighbors are appalled, but others are all in favor of making it a real wall to keep out the immigrants nearby.It was a bit of an odd film, but a good one. The acting was spot-on and it was fun to see an East German woman complaining about immigrants getting tax euros only to have a West German woman point out that the East Germans get most of their money from the west. It's a nice compliment to the feature film.",4,Welcome!

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[8, 8]","WELCOME (2009, in English, French and Kurdish, 112 minutes) is a poignant, harsh look at the plight of the Iraqi Kurds trying to enter England. The Kurdish people have always fascinated me: they are a Fourth World people. Stupid to describe such people as ""World"" since it means a culture that has no home country or even home state. I think the Kurds along with the Tibetans are the only Fourth World people on earth at the moment - but I could be wrong.Handsome 17-year-old Bilal Kayani (Firat Ayverdi) has walked 4,000 kilometers to France, so he can get to England and his girlfriend Mina (Derya Ayverdi), who is living there with her family. He is ready to marry her no matter what.Basset-hound-handsome Vincent Lindon plays grizzled French swim coach Simon Calmet (character wrongly spelled ""Calmat"" in listed credits, spelled ""Calmet"" in film and subtitles). One day Bilal shows up at the pool to take lessons from Simon. He plans to swim the Channel to get to England and Mina.Simon, rapidly growing fond of this son he never had, takes Bilal under his wing and agrees to train him to swim the Channel. France has very fascistic laws against these illegals, and there is a lot of prejudice from the French people. Simon gets a lot of flak for ""harboring"" Bilal; he is eventually accused of having a relationship with him (so, the French admit the temptation is there even though they regard these poor people as insects). The truth is Bilal becomes very much like a son to Simon.Bilal makes a break for it, swims the channel and drowns. Simon is informed and before you know it, everyone is attending poor, sweet Bilal's funeral. This whole twist in the story made me sad and angry. It reminded me of deeply beloved friends I have buried, and also made me think of how we should treat people who are in a terrible bind - as opposed to the way we usually treat them.This award-winning, highly praised film is probably going to be viewed by the average American as retread. I didn't see it that way, but then I fell in love with Firat Ayverdi which was probably the general idea. It does have the slow, quiet pace and general lack of soundtrack one should expect from good European film. The performances are understated, exquisite in general and very moving in places. I think viewers will be impressed by both Firat Ayverdi (this is his 1st and only film thus far) and Vincent Lindon.We don't get these brilliant gems in America too often and it is a miracle anyone cares enough to release them on DVD. I've had it with this, but it doesn't look like it'll change anytime soon.

1317810,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0031SU2Y2,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","Philippe Lioret has written (with Emmanuel Courcol, Olivier Adam, and Serge Frydman) and directed this touching and compelling story of the trials of immigrants attempting to escape war-torn Iraq, reminding us of yet another aspect of the brutality of war. Titled WELCOME, it is anything but, as it demonstrates the averse feelings of the European countries to the plight of immigrants.  This is a solid, well written and sculpted story that in the hands of a small cast of excellent actors reaches for the heart of the viewer and finds it.Simon Calmat (Vincent Lindon) is a French swimming coach in the painful period of signing divorce papers from his wife Marion (Audrey Dana), a socially impassioned woman who serves at the food kitchen in Calais, France, providing nourishment and support for homeless immigrants. Simon discovers a young Kurdish illegal immigrant from Mosul, Iraq, Bilal Kayani (Firat Ayverdi), who has endured torture form the Turks who force him to wear a black sack over his head for an extended period of time until he escapes.  In Calais he pays 500 Euros and joins with a group of fellow asylum seekers in an attempt to be smuggled by truck through the  English Channel Tunnel,  but his memory of the hood experience has made him terrified of wearing the plastic bag over his head required of the 'clandestines' when crossing the borders to avoid the CO2 detectors used by the guards. Bilal's dream is to cross into England where his girlfriend  Mina (Derya Ayverdi, Firat's real life sister!) waits, attempting to avoid an arranged marriage her father demands. Largely due to Bilal's inability to keep the plastic bag over his head during the attempted escape, the immigrants are captured and returned to France.  It is then that Simon sees him on the street and befriends him, not only accepting him as a swimming pupil (Balil's dream is to swim across the English Channel for Mina) but also sharing his home and food with him.  Bilal is polite and grateful and a bond forms between the lonely Simon and Bilal.  A nosey neighbor exposes Simon as an illegal alien protector and Bilal runs away to protect Simon's reputation. Knowing that Bilal is determined to swim the English Channel Simon helps as best he can, but the film ends  in a surprise  that affects everyone who has been involved with the act of humanity to an illegal immigrant.Vincent Lindon is brilliant as the newly compassionate Simon, and Firat Ayverdi is a very fine new actor who should enjoy a successful future in films: he simply has it all - looks, screen presence, and acting ability. One aspect of the film that makes it so very powerful is the manner in which Loiret explores the souls of Bilal and his wary protector Simon: WELCOME unveils a world of overwhelming forces, both natural and social, that examine the waters of history,  forces that may be resisted, but they will not be stopped.  This is a film that should be considered imperative watching for every member of society.

Since he is unable to get snuggled across the Channel in a truck, the boy eventually decides to train and then swin across the Channel. The movie makes excellent use of the Calais scenery including those tempting views on clear days of the English ""white rocks"" which look so close but yet are so far away.Vincent Lindon and Audrey Dana (as his divorcing wife with whom he remains on mostly good terms) bring good performances, but they are both outclassed by newcomer Firat Ayverdi as the 17 year old Iraqi boy. Last but not least, I thought the movie did an excellent job in setting the table of the multitude of immigration and asylum issues that plague so many West-European countries. Be aware, this movie is not for the faint of heart, and without giving anything away, don't count on your typical ""Hollywood happy ending"". This movie caught my attention from start to finish.

1317816,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0031SU2Y2,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","""Welcome"" begins with a 17-year-old Kurdish refugee Bilal's attempt to get smuggled into England. He is on the last lap of his long road to reunite his girlfriend Mina now living in London with her family. When Bilal's attempt fails, however, he finds himself stuck in Calais, the closest French town to England across the Channel.The opening part of a French drama ""Welcome"" might remind you of a 2002 film ""In This World"" directed by Michael Winterbottom, but as the story unfolds, you will realize that ""Welcome"" is more about the unlikely friendship between two people than the journey the young protagonist takes. Bilal (Firat Ayverdi), though being a poor swimmer, takes lessons from the local instructor Simon (Vincent Lindon, ""Pour Elle""). It doesn't take much time for Simon to see why Bilal is so eager to learn swimming. Bilal is going to swim across the Channel to meet his love.The film's story is told with a very low key and somber approach. Though dealing with a political subject matter like illegal immigration, the quiet film refrains from shoving a message down your throat. ""Welcome"" is carefully crafted with an eye for detail that makes the two major characters Simon and Bilal vivid and complex.""Welcome"" benefits from compelling performances from the cast, most notably from the stars: newcomer Firat Ayverdi as Bilal, and Vincent Lindon as Simon, whose original motive for helping the Kurdish boy might not be totally altruistic. Simon still loves his estranged wife Marion (Audrey Dana), a schoolteacher who also works as a volunteer helping refugees. Is it that Simon only wanted to impress her?""Welcome"" is an engaging drama that maintains its dramatic tension throughout, greatly helped by the strong acting from the cast and the believable characters you really care.",4,Across the Channel: Engrossing Drama,1299110400,"03 3, 2011",2011,1798,"['Welcome', '17-year-old', 'Kurdish', 'refugee', 'Bilal', 'attempt', 'get', 'smuggled', 'England', 'last', 'lap', 'long', 'road', 'reunite', 'girlfriend', 'Mina', 'now', 'living', 'London', 'family', 'When', 'Bilal', 'attempt', 'however', 'stuck', 'Calais', 'closest', 'French', 'town', 'England', 'Channel.The', 'opening', 'part', 'French', 'drama', 'Welcome', 'might', 'remind', '2002', 'film', 'World', 'directed', 'Michael', 'Winterbottom', 'story', 'unfolds', 'will', 'realize', 'Welcome', 'more', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'two', 'people', 'journey', 'young', 'protagonist', 'Bilal', 'Firat', 'Ayverdi', 'being', 'poor', 'swimmer', 'lessons', 'local', 'instructor', 'Simon', 'Vincent', 'Lindon', 'Pour', 'Elle', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'time', 'Simon', 'see', 'why', 'Bilal', 'so', 'eager', 'learn', 'swimming', 'Bilal', 'going', 'swim', 'Channel', 'meet', 'love.The', 'film', 'story', 'told', 'very', 'low', 'key', 'somber', 'approach', 'dealing', 'political', 'subject', 'matter', 'illegal', 'immigration', 'quiet', 'film', 'refrains', 'shoving', 'message', 'down', 'throat', 'Welcome', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'eye', 'detail', 'two', 'major', 'characters', 'Simon', 'Bilal', 'vivid', 'complex', 'Welcome', 'benefits', 'compelling', 'performances', 'cast', 'most', 'notably', 'stars', 'newcomer', 'Firat', 'Ayverdi', 'Bilal', 'Vincent', 'Lindon', 'Simon', 'original', 'motive', 'helping', 'Kurdish', 'boy', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'totally', 'altruistic', 'Simon', 'still', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Marion', 'Audrey', 'Dana', 'schoolteacher', 'who', 'also', 'volunteer', 'helping', 'refugees', 'Simon', 'only', 'wanted', 'impress', 'Welcome', 'engaging', 'drama', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'greatly', 'helped', 'strong', 'acting', 'cast', 'believable', 'characters', 'really', 'care']",N/A
