231182,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,630026629X,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Stagecoach, 1968 filmThe story begins out in the West. Indians attack a stage station. There is a fight in a bar over a dance hall girl. ""Get rid of your undesirables"" says the Captain. The stagecoach rolls into town to change horses. Dr. John Boone moves to a fresher field. There is humor here about hypocrisy. The dirt streets are suitably muddy. The stagecoach leaves to its next stop. They stop to pick up Ringo as a passenger. They learn the Sioux Indians are on the warpath. The station manager and his family plan to leave their post. The stagecoach travels on the hills at night (for added drama)! There are conflicts among the passengers. When they arrive at the next station they find the people there were all killed! There is more drama and conversation.They see Indians, and turn back. Will they be saved? They see soldiers in uniform approaching. But this is a trick to get closer. Ringo climbs up to join in the shooting. Can they escape? Then a wheel falls off! They must take cover against a larger mobile force. The Indians keep charging as if they were paid well to die. Then suddenly they turn and flee! But it is only to regroup for another attack. [Nobody seems to lack ammunition.] ""I guess that was it."" That night they arrive in town. There is a rowdy bunch in the saloon. The Marshal makes a mistake. But Ringo is freed to do what needs to be done. At the end the Marshal frees Ringo and the dance hall girl to go where they choose to go.This is a copy of the 1935 version. Was it better?

Williams ""gareth37""","[3, 3]","When you toss in a stoic US Marshal, a devoted but underpaid Overland stagecoach driver, a gentleman gambler, a dishonest banker, a whiskey salesman, a pregnant woman, a saloon madam, a dime novel desperado who was falsely imprisoned, and the charming Doc Holiday you have a motley crew.  When you add the Apaches, including Geronimo, and the US Calvary, you have the potential for an explosive situation.This third remake of John Ford's Stagecoach (1939) is a lively production with a lot of country singers/actors (Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, Waylon Jennings, John Schneider, Tony Franciosa, Elizabeth Ashley, Mary Crosby, June Carter Cash, and Anthony Newley).  Willie Nelson sings the title song which is catchy.  The music throughout adds the right atmospheric touches to the desert landscapes of Arizona.There is humor mixed in with the drama and tension. The acting is low key but very good.  The story is well executed.Doc Holiday's sympathetic comments about the Apaches were a nice touch.  Not too many westerns showed any sympathy to the Native Americans and their territorial rights.  Manifest Destiny's crossing of the plains and mountains was unstoppable by a people who lived in harmony with the land.Of course you have the classic gunfight at the end between the falsely imprisoned desperado and the actual bad guy.  The gentleman gambler and Doc Holiday are there to make certain the fight is just between the two men without interference from the bad guy's brothers.This was a 1986 made-for-TV movie.

This job is taken care of jokingly. The anxiety of 1939 Doc Boone is nonexistent. Similarly the tension of Lucy and Dallas has almost gone. Dallas and Ringo are middle-aged persons, which is surely O.K., but changes the youthful hesitation of the first and second pair.

231195,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,630026629X,Muzzlehatch,"[2, 3]","If the 1966 version of STAGECOACH (sadly, never available either on VHS or DVD, and a bit better than its reputation) was basically an attempt to recapture the magic of the earlier film by putting it in Cinemascope and Technicolor, adding large dollops of more-realistic violence and drawing out the story to give the film a more ""epic"" quality, it seems at first glance that the 1986 film is going in the opposite direction.  While the first remake draws the Indian attack out to 20 minutes or so and the final showdown to a series of scenes adding up to several minutes, this Ted Post TV movie starring a bunch of aging country music stars cuts the violence and action to the bare minimum, focusing instead on personality and dialogue.  I suppose the theory was that when you've got legends like Willie Nelson (also a producer), Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings and Kris Kristofferson as your leads, you'll get that older ""country"" TV audience and you don't need to worry about the violence that in 1986 you couldn't really show on TV anyway.Well, that was the theory I suppose.  The reality, though, is very little action and a lackluster and plodding series of conversations, most of which feel either weird or hackneyed - or both - and which for the most part aren't delivered with a whole lot of conviction by the famous cast.  I think Cash (as Curly the Marshall) and Kristofferson as Ringo, despite being nearly 20 years older than Wayne or Alex Cord were in the role, probably come off the best; Jennings seems to be sleepwalking through his role of Halliday the gambler and Nelson either doesn't understand his part or just doesn't care much as the drunken doctor - inexplicably ""Doc Holiday"" in this version though no references to his history with the Earps are ever forthcoming.  John Schneider, fresh of ""The Dukes of Hazzard"", as Buck the stagecoach driver is the youngest member of the cast at 26 and he tries hard in a role that just isn't as interesting - despite some added scenes - as it was in the two previous versions, albeit much of the charm came from Andy Devine and Slim Pickens in the earlier roles.  Elizabeth Ashley does all right as Dallas, looking a lot more weary and used-up than Claire Trevor or especially Ann-Margret did; Anthony Franciosa doesn't have much to do as Gatewood and Anthony Newley's Peacock turns back in this version halfway through the film, I guess because the filmmakers thought he was expendable and maybe added too much to the budget or running time.  Mary Crosby is lovely as the pregnant Mrs. Mallory but she gets little of consequence to do, apart from the very strange scene with Nelson as she's starting to go into labor where he tries to reassure her by telling her he doesn't know what he's doing.The action as I said is minimal; interestingly the relationship that really gets explored in this version is that between Curly and Buck, which is one thing this film gets right as Cash and Schneider seem to be the most involved in their roles.  Lots of frontier humor and a bit of dark satire run through the film, and there's a slightly larger political overtone than in earlier versions, with Nelson regularly espousing anger at the plight of the natives (Apaches in this version, which was filmed in Arizona).  The central problem here I think is that the characters that really need developing - Ringo and Dallas, and to some extent Doc - really don't get it, and a lot of time is spent instead on fairly useless if entertaining asides.  There's also never any real question here that Ringo is a good guy - ironic in that Kristofferson has played a lot more villains than either Wayne or Cord ever did - and he even gets deputized to help with the nasty Plummer boys at the end!  Nice photography by Gary Graver, who had spent the previous couple of decades working both in the adult film industry and for Orson Welles; minimal score by Nelson (who also sings the OK title song) and David Allan Coe.Overall, watchable enough but rather a waste of some great talent.  Let's just hope this doesn't get remade again anytime soon as each version has been weaker than the last by a large margin, and I shudder to speculate on the cast - especially if an attempt were to be made to appeal to the youth audience.

231196,A18H6KCOM1IPDZ,630026629X,PAS,"[6, 6]","OK, it's not the original.  Step back a minute - few movies at ALL before or since the original verison of ""Stagecoach"" were as good as that movie.  Now, move on and look at this version of ""Stagecoach"" on its own.It's pretty well written and acted. (June Carter Cash's lines were great, ""There's nothing in my contract says I got to feed the Army."")  A lot better than most of what I see appearing in the theater today, most of which I won't waste my money to go see.The only characters I didn't really like were Elizabeth Ashley's Dallas & Mary Crosby's Mrs. Mallory.  I loved Elizabeth Ashley in a lot of other roles, especially in ""Evening Shade"" with Burt Reynolds.  I know she's a great actress, but this role, or maybe her dialogue, just didn't work for me somehow.  Too overdone.  I do like her line to Doc about his fingerprints.Mary Crosby, a good actress, too, said she campaigned to get this role, because her Dad was in the 1966 version.  I understand that.  I just thought her character was too bitchy for a Southern lady, especially an Army wife.  Again, though, that's the way the dialogue was written, so I guess she was stuck with it.  The scene playing as I write this is a good one for her, where she finds out her husband has been wounded.  She's strong, but not complaining or bitchy.The humor is a little dry throughout, you have to pay attention.  It doesn't walk up and hit you over the head.  And there's no 13 year old talking back at his or her elders for laughs.  Maybe that's why it appeals to me.John Schneider does a great job as the coach driver.  Again, not Andy Devine, but, he doesn't try to be.  And if he did, it would be ridiculous.Half the fun of watching this movie is saying, ""Oh, there's ______!"" spotting other country singers or actors.Then there's the old saying we use in our household: ""It's a western, how bad can it be?""",5,Great movie,1257897600,"11 11, 2009",2009,1870,"['OK', 'not', 'original', 'Step', 'back', 'minute', 'few', 'movies', 'ALL', 'original', 'verison', 'Stagecoach', 'were', 'as', 'good', 'movie', 'Now', 'move', 'look', 'version', 'Stagecoach', 'own.It', 'pretty', 'well', 'written', 'acted', 'June', 'Carter', 'Cash', 'lines', 'were', 'great', 'nothing', 'contract', 'got', 'feed', 'Army', 'lot', 'better', 'most', 'what', 'see', 'appearing', 'theater', 'today', 'most', 'wo', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'go', 'see.The', 'only', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'were', 'Elizabeth', 'Ashley', 'Dallas', 'Mary', 'Crosby', 'Mrs.', 'Mallory', 'loved', 'Elizabeth', 'Ashley', 'lot', 'other', 'roles', 'especially', 'Evening', 'Shade', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'know', 'great', 'actress', 'role', 'maybe', 'dialogue', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'somehow', 'Too', 'overdone', 'do', 'line', 'Doc', 'fingerprints.Mary', 'Crosby', 'good', 'actress', 'too', 'said', 'campaigned', 'get', 'role', 'Dad', 'was', '1966', 'version', 'understand', 'just', 'thought', 'character', 'was', 'too', 'bitchy', 'Southern', 'lady', 'especially', 'Army', 'wife', 'Again', 'though', 'way', 'dialogue', 'was', 'written', 'guess', 'was', 'stuck', 'scene', 'playing', 'write', 'good', 'one', 'her', 'where', 'out', 'husband', 'been', 'wounded', 'strong', 'not', 'complaining', 'bitchy.The', 'humor', 'little', 'dry', 'have', 'pay', 'attention', ""n't"", 'walk', 'up', 'hit', 'head', '13', 'year', 'old', 'talking', 'back', 'elders', 'laughs', 'Maybe', 'why', 'appeals', 'me.John', 'Schneider', 'great', 'job', 'coach', 'driver', 'Again', 'not', 'Andy', 'Devine', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'did', 'would', 'be', 'ridiculous.Half', 'fun', 'watching', 'movie', 'saying', 'Oh', '______', 'spotting', 'other', 'country', 'singers', 'actors.Then', 'old', 'saying', 'use', 'household', 'western', 'how', 'bad', 'can', 'be']",N/A
