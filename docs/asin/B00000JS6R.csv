The film follows Leonard Cohen around Montreal, Canada(where he is on vacation from his home in Greece) as he goes about his daily life. The film also shows interviews with Cohen and has readings of his poetry in the background. Leonard Cohen is a man of many incarnations and this is simply one of them. The biggest surprise for me was seeing Leonard Cohen do standup comedy. While I don't believe Leonard Cohen is as depressing as most have made him out to be, I definitely would have never expect to see him do comedy. This documentary reminded me of Bob Dylan's &quot;Don't Look Back,&quot; an intimate look at an artist at a very young age.

507932,A9HKBYQB4XIEV,B00000JS6R,"""eurotrashgirl""","[72, 73]","I just rented this fabulous DVD about Canadian novelist/poet/singer/traveller Leonard Cohen and am so glad I did... it is a little gem of a movie, giving us a first-hand look into the young Cohen as he, in his quiet, attractive way, lives and learns and laughs about life, in whatever order the day seems to bring him.Filmed in Black &amp; White and released in 1965, the film was made as a 'documentary,' and as such takes us 'behind-the-scenes' into a slightly-staged version of Cohen's day-to-day life, complete with scenes of him waking up, bathing, shaving, hanging out at the local bar or a friend's house with his closest friends, at a book signing, and walking in the Montreal park where he played as a child. The film was shot before he became famous as a singer, and as such it focuses mainly on his work/career as a poet and novelist.The film was made by the Canadian National Film Board, and as such has a dated, now-quite-funny voice-over about Cohen. At the same time, the people behind the film definetely &quot;got&quot; Cohen -- the film is made with the same type of quiet humour that Cohen himself possesses. I think one of my favorite moments in the film shows Cohen being interviewed by a stern, older man who insists that Cohen couldn't possibly be a poet without things that &quot;bother&quot; or upset him. The man kind of insinuated that Cohen must have a mission of some sort, something deep -- that by being a poet, he must have been trying to address some wrong in the world and do something which would help correct it. But Cohen would have none of that. Looking like he does for much of the film: quiet, a bit smug, self-consciously attractive and intelligent, Cohen quietly responds, in a soft-spoken manner similar to that of B&amp;W footage I've seen of fellow '60's poet Jim Morrison, &quot;well, what I'm really interested in is a state of grace. When I wake up in the morning, I have to know that things are in balance....&quot; The interviewer gives up completely then, and instead of getting any more miffed or confused, finally says, &quot;okay, now you've lost me.&quot; And then you know it's Score One, Cohen and Film; Score Zero, Stuffy Clueless Interviewer.I Highly Recommended this film to fans of Cohen's music, his writing, or others of the wanna-be beatnik variety. There are plenty of black turtlenecks, steaming cups of coffee, intently gazing eyes, sly comic humour, stern black glasses, and seductively charming lines. His deadpan sarcasm and semi-stand-up comedy routines work just as well in 2001 as they did in 1964. His dashing, quiet, tongue-in-cheek humour reminds me much of a reading I saw recently of fellow Canadian writer, Margaret Atwood. They both had me laughing in the aisles. But it was smart laughter, if that makes sense.Better than a trip to the local coffehouse for that poetry slam -- well, just as good, but this one gives you a glimpse of history. I found it captivating. Forty years later, the Man still has It.",5,The Year: 1964. The Country: Canada.

If you're new to Leonard Cohen or familiar with only his music, then this documentary is a great way to see him in his youth, as a rising star poet. True, it feels dated, as well it should. If you can get past its rather stiff 60s style of production, you'll get a glimpse of a brilliant young man reflecting on his life to that point.

I guess I was the only person on the planet, who had never heard this song.  I had to print out lyrics because it was so beautiful; I was a proud Canadian again because of Leonard Cohen.
