1178938,A1C0NMCONVFVF4,B001D2WUCA,Chloe,"[2, 4]","I used to watch this every morning & again late afternoons during the mid 1980s on The CBN Cable Network which was a channel that once showcased the finest vintage sitcoms ever.I watched Bachelor Father, Dobie Gillis & Father Knows Best everyday & had my video machine going to put 'em all on tape. As a result I've got loads of Father Knows Best episodes & have even transferred some to DVD as the show hadn't been yet made available on DVD, so my homemade DVDs were something to tide me over anyway.I'm very pleased to see the series finally get the DVD treatment. I, like some of the others am displeased & think it unfortunate that some of these are syndicated prints. However, as this is a true rarity & has been scarce in rerun markets over the years, I'll gladly take the first & second season & every & any additional seasons that become available in the future. Episodes of Father Knows Best in any DVD offering, syndicated and/or otherwise is better than not having it in any form at all. Sure, I'd love having the completely unedited prints same as many others who have griped about this, but if the syndicated are the majority of prints available in this set, then so be it. They will due until some distributor makes the unedited ones available. For the time being, I'm satisfied.Some of my favorite episodes were the one where Kathy played a sleuth to unravel a mystery, the one where Kathy is a real tomboy & in the closing scene she makes a grand entrance to her date in a lovely dress. The one where Kathy takes a friend's baby sister & wants to be her mother which had been in one of the earlier shows.Betty awaiting word on her boyfriend, the jet pilot, Betty being a snob to Bud around her friends, the christmas show which featured Wallace Ford as Santy. Great, great episodes. These plots had morals & The Andersons are a staple of 1950s middle class wholesome americana.I also LOVED Father Knows Best: Home For Christmas, one of the two reunion movies of 1977 (hadn't seen the previous one, Father Knows Best Reunion).I thought Billy Gray (Bud) was so cute & endearing as he had gotten into his upper teens!Elinor Donahue (Betty) was so down-to-earth & upbeat & had some of the most comical one-liners in some of the earlier episodes where she'd make a sharp-witted remark about Bud to Father! She also had a warm & bright smile that was remarkable.Lauren Chapin (Kathy) was everyone's favorite half-pint tomboyish kid sister who at times felt neglected & was always there with a shoulder. I bought Lauren Chapin's Father Does Know Best autobiography back when it was first released & am proud to have it in my library of favorite publications/memorabilia. I empathize with all she's overcome & the inner strength & determination that got her through it in the long run. We LOVE you, Lauren!Jim & Margaret were there with words of wisdom & instilled values in their children which is timeless & makes this show appropriate for kids of all ages. It's also clean & inoffensive & makes the grade as a classic worth having in your DVD library of really good 1950s family sitcoms. I'm an avid fan of the vintage radio series as well!",5,Father Knows Best - Season 2 (unedited?
