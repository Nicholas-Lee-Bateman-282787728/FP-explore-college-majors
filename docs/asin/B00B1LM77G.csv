1621057,A2A596PVOT9Q8L,B00B1LM77G,Monica C.,"[1, 1]","I really enjoyed this version of Alice in Wonderland. It followed the actual story almost perfectly, unlike most versions. The costuming was really quite beautiful. The whole miniseries was done in almost a story book appearance. Through the entire show, the background appears to be done with a green screen, which the story book looking background was later added. I personally liked the look of it, because it gave you the feeling of being inside the story. I not only recommend this version to collectors like myself, but I also recommend it to anyone who would like to experience Alice in Wonderland, other than the well known Disney version.",5,True to the story,1395360000,"03 21, 2014",2014,647,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'version', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'followed', 'actual', 'story', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'most', 'versions', 'costuming', 'was', 'really', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'whole', 'miniseries', 'was', 'done', 'almost', 'story', 'book', 'appearance', 'entire', 'show', 'background', 'be', 'done', 'green', 'screen', 'story', 'book', 'looking', 'background', 'was', 'later', 'added', 'personally', 'liked', 'look', 'gave', 'feeling', 'being', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'recommend', 'version', 'collectors', 'also', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'experience', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'other', 'well', 'known', 'Disney', 'version']",Alice in Wonderland
