I read the review which seemed positive and pulled the trigger.  The set is really great for the money.  The compression on the video is pretty high in order to fit all the seasons onto this many discs so you will notice it is a little grainier than you might expect from television broadcast quality.  I would equate this to a good HD cable signal rather than a super high quality Blu-ray.  It is still HD none the less and it is still very pristine.  As I said, the seasons are stored on multiple discs and packaged nicely in several snap cases inside of a cardboard sleeve.  This saves on space rather having a whole shelf full of seasons.

1615101,AEOCEVUWO5B7P,B00AQN09G6,J. Page,"[79, 91]","My wife and I only recently started catching re-runs of this gem of a show and I decided that a more expedient way of catching up before the seventh season was starting was to purchase this set, which includes all six seasons on blu-ray.At the time I placed the order I did not realize that this is the UK/Europe region-free version of the show.Each season is arranged on TWO blu-ray discs, which means the shows are compressed quite a bit more than they are on the North American BD releases (where I believe every season is on 3-4 discs).  Also worth noting is that these come with DTS audio, in lieu of HD audio... not that it will make much of a difference for a sitcom.  I don't know how much the compression really matters, they look similar to HD broadcast quality to me, with each episode clocking in around 3GB in size.  It might matter to someone who wants the absolute top quality achievable for the show though so I'm mentioning it.The shows being compressed is not my principal beef with this set.  The packaging for this set is pretty terrible.  Seasons 1-3 and Seasons 4-6 are each contained in a thicker than normal BD case that is really flimsy.  I actually dropped one from about 3 feet onto a tile floor and pretty much destroyed it (part of the spine broke off and it no longer closes).  Even worse, the cardboard that houses these two BD cases is made of really flimsy light weight cardboard, not the thicker ""collection quality"" cardboard that I expect with box sets.The show itself of course is great, and if you don't care about the packaging quality, the episodes seem to be the same as their US version counterparts... so this does save you a few bucks versus buying the US versions on sale.  When I checked, Seasons 1-5 were on sale at worst buy for about $20 per season with season 6 being about $30, so by going this route I saved about $45.//update - it has been pointed out to me in comments that all versions (US and otherwise) of this show have DTS audio and have a similar number of episodes per disc... although there might be more special features on US domestic versions.  The packaging for the set is still pretty terrible, so I will stand by the 3-star review.",3,Great show - crappy packaging,1379721600,"09 21, 2013",2013,2199,"['wife', 'only', 'recently', 'started', 'catching', 're-runs', 'gem', 'show', 'decided', 'more', 'expedient', 'way', 'catching', 'up', 'seventh', 'season', 'was', 'starting', 'was', 'purchase', 'set', 'six', 'seasons', 'blu-ray.At', 'time', 'placed', 'order', 'did', 'not', 'realize', 'UK/Europe', 'region-free', 'version', 'show.Each', 'season', 'arranged', 'TWO', 'blu-ray', 'discs', 'shows', 'are', 'compressed', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'are', 'North', 'American', 'BD', 'releases', 'where', 'believe', 'season', '3-4', 'discs', 'Also', 'worth', 'noting', 'come', 'DTS', 'audio', 'lieu', 'HD', 'audio', 'not', 'will', 'make', 'much', 'difference', 'sitcom', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'compression', 'really', 'matters', 'look', 'similar', 'HD', 'broadcast', 'quality', 'episode', 'clocking', '3GB', 'size', 'might', 'matter', 'someone', 'who', 'absolute', 'top', 'quality', 'achievable', 'show', 'so', ""'m"", 'mentioning', 'it.The', 'shows', 'being', 'compressed', 'not', 'principal', 'beef', 'set', 'packaging', 'set', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'Seasons', '1-3', 'Seasons', '4-6', 'are', 'contained', 'thicker', 'normal', 'BD', 'case', 'really', 'flimsy', 'actually', 'dropped', 'one', '3', 'feet', 'tile', 'floor', 'pretty', 'much', 'destroyed', 'part', 'spine', 'broke', 'no', 'longer', 'closes', 'Even', 'worse', 'cardboard', 'houses', 'two', 'BD', 'cases', 'made', 'really', 'flimsy', 'light', 'weight', 'cardboard', 'not', 'thicker', 'collection', 'quality', 'cardboard', 'expect', 'box', 'sets.The', 'show', 'course', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'packaging', 'quality', 'episodes', 'seem', 'be', 'same', 'US', 'version', 'counterparts', 'so', 'save', 'few', 'bucks', 'buying', 'US', 'versions', 'sale', 'When', 'checked', 'Seasons', '1-5', 'were', 'sale', 'worst', 'buy', 'about', '20', 'season', 'season', '6', 'being', '30', 'so', 'going', 'route', 'saved', 'about', '45.//update', 'been', 'pointed', 'out', 'comments', 'versions', 'US', 'otherwise', 'show', 'have', 'DTS', 'audio', 'have', 'similar', 'number', 'episodes', 'disc', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'special', 'features', 'US', 'domestic', 'versions', 'packaging', 'set', 'still', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'will', 'stand', '3-star', 'review']","The Big Bang Theory Seasons 1-6  The Big Bang Theory - Seasons One to Six  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 United Kingdom"

1615106,AWDE6JJAGUFWZ,B00AQN09G6,Richard,"[1, 2]","When I received the set, I was concerned that because it came from the UK, it might be in PAL (European) format instead of NTSC (USA). Nowhere on either the outside box, case boxes or the discs does it state what format they are (unlike USA made discs). Region codes are not specified either. It is stated in the description above that they are Region coded A/B/C, which are codes I've never heard of. I've only heard of numeric codes with '1' being USA and '0' being worldwide. I was relieved to find that all discs play just fine on my Sony 3D BD player. Like other reviewers, I found the  menu on the first season to be difficult to navigate since the background changing from blue to tan is the only way to tell what button the cursor is on. The other season discs are thankfully changed to a more defined difference in button definition. My main purpose in purchasing this set was to save half of what the individual seasons cost in most any store. I can forego the &#34;collector's&#34; style of a sturdier box for half the price and I haven't really noticed much difference in the picture quality from the HD TV presentations I have seen (referring to the suspected lower quality that half the disc quantity of each season might bring).",5,Great TV Series - a laugh riot!,1399852800,"05 12, 2014",2014,1243,"['When', 'received', 'set', 'was', 'concerned', 'came', 'UK', 'might', 'be', 'PAL', 'European', 'format', 'instead', 'NTSC', 'USA', 'Nowhere', 'outside', 'box', 'case', 'boxes', 'discs', 'state', 'what', 'format', 'are', 'USA', 'made', 'discs', 'Region', 'codes', 'are', 'not', 'specified', 'either', 'stated', 'description', 'are', 'Region', 'coded', 'A/B/C', 'are', 'codes', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', ""'ve"", 'only', 'heard', 'numeric', 'codes', '1', 'being', 'USA', '0', 'being', 'was', 'relieved', 'find', 'discs', 'play', 'just', 'fine', 'Sony', '3D', 'BD', 'player', 'other', 'reviewers', 'found', 'menu', 'first', 'season', 'be', 'difficult', 'navigate', 'background', 'changing', 'blue', 'tan', 'only', 'way', 'tell', 'what', 'cursor', 'other', 'season', 'discs', 'are', 'thankfully', 'changed', 'more', 'defined', 'difference', 'button', 'definition', 'main', 'purpose', 'purchasing', 'set', 'was', 'save', 'half', 'what', 'individual', 'seasons', 'cost', 'most', 'store', 'can', 'forego', '34', 'collector', '34', 'style', 'sturdier', 'box', 'price', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'noticed', 'much', 'difference', 'picture', 'quality', 'HD', 'TV', 'presentations', 'have', 'seen', 'referring', 'suspected', 'lower', 'quality', 'disc', 'quantity', 'season', 'might', 'bring']","The Big Bang Theory Seasons 1-6  The Big Bang Theory - Seasons One to Six  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 United Kingdom"
