946094,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000BO0L90,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","School Of Life is a film intended for children and young teenagers.  This is plainly obvious by the jokes and storytelling we encounter in the beginning- everything's so tame and people over the age of 16 won't like this.  By that point they'll feel like they're too old to give a darn about the problems of an 8th grader (and the film makes these kids seem even younger than that- more like 5th graders).It's about a father (played by David Paymer) that plays the role of a boring middle school teacher.  Despite his best efforts, he cannot get the students to care about his lessons.  Why?  Because the cool teacher (played by Ryan Reynolds) is apparently down the hall, and this is the classroom ALL the kids want to be in.  They want their lessons to be *fun*, simple as that.  Dressing up in costumes and bringing history to life is the best way to illustrate the ultimate history lesson and raise the attention span of any kid desperately searching for a reason to care about past events.  Speaking of history, I can hardly blame these kids for being bored out of their mind- I remember my 7th and 8th grade history lessons.  They were so boring I nearly fell asleep but I always respected the teachers who tried their hardest to make history interesting.  History honestly isn't exciting until you're much older and wiser anyway- when you're a kid you want to have fun.Anyway, it just so happens this boring father/teacher has a son in the same grade he's teaching and surprise surprise!  The son attends the cool teachers room and gets to sit beside the girl of his dreams.  What's strange is that the girl almost immediately finds an interest in the boy without the usual humiliation and uncomfortable embarrassment that we associate with a boy trying to hit on a girl.Unfortunately this movie itself is just really boring.  There's a surprise later on involving the cool teacher (that unfortunately a few reviewers spoil below- ugh).  It's a decent twist, but the only reason I'm giving this movie 3 stars is because the boring teacher finds himself in a series of whacky situations (such as exploding microwavable moon pies covering the front of his shirt, and the segment where he gets into a fight with his wife and finds himself driving to school late at night and falling asleep with his pajamas on in the middle of a classroom only to awake by morning surrounded by laughing kids making fun of the way he's dressed).I suppose the cool teacher would be an inspiration to someone around 12 years old watching this movie, but School Of Life does absolutely nothing as a family movie.  Also, I feel the storyline is incomplete concerning the ""teacher of the year"" award.  You'll see what I mean.  The movie feels like it misses an important and fitting conclusion.  School Of Life is for kids.",3,what a life... of mediocrity,1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,2805,"['School', 'Life', 'film', 'intended', 'children', 'young', 'teenagers', 'plainly', 'obvious', 'jokes', 'storytelling', 'encounter', 'beginning-', 'everything', 'so', 'tame', 'people', 'age', '16', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'point', ""'ll"", 'feel', ""'re"", 'too', 'old', 'give', 'darn', 'problems', '8th', 'grader', 'film', 'kids', 'seem', 'even', 'younger', 'that-', 'more', '5th', 'graders', '.It', 'father', 'played', 'David', 'Paymer', 'role', 'boring', 'middle', 'school', 'teacher', 'best', 'efforts', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'students', 'care', 'lessons', 'Why', 'cool', 'teacher', 'played', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'apparently', 'down', 'hall', 'classroom', 'kids', 'want', 'be', 'want', 'lessons', 'be', '*fun*', 'simple', 'Dressing', 'up', 'costumes', 'bringing', 'history', 'life', 'best', 'way', 'illustrate', 'ultimate', 'history', 'lesson', 'raise', 'attention', 'span', 'kid', 'desperately', 'searching', 'reason', 'care', 'past', 'events', 'Speaking', 'history', 'can', 'hardly', 'blame', 'kids', 'being', 'bored', 'mind-', 'remember', '7th', '8th', 'grade', 'history', 'lessons', 'were', 'so', 'boring', 'nearly', 'fell', 'asleep', 'always', 'respected', 'teachers', 'who', 'tried', 'hardest', 'make', 'history', 'interesting', 'History', 'honestly', ""n't"", 'exciting', ""'re"", 'much', 'older', 'wiser', 'anyway-', 'when', ""'re"", 'kid', 'want', 'have', 'fun.Anyway', 'just', 'so', 'boring', 'father/teacher', 'son', 'same', 'grade', 'teaching', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'son', 'cool', 'teachers', 'room', 'sit', 'girl', 'dreams', 'What', 'strange', 'girl', 'almost', 'immediately', 'interest', 'boy', 'usual', 'humiliation', 'uncomfortable', 'embarrassment', 'associate', 'boy', 'trying', 'hit', 'girl.Unfortunately', 'movie', 'just', 'really', 'boring', 'surprise', 'later', 'involving', 'cool', 'teacher', 'unfortunately', 'few', 'reviewers', 'spoil', 'below-', 'ugh', 'decent', 'twist', 'only', 'reason', ""'m"", 'giving', 'movie', '3', 'stars', 'boring', 'teacher', 'series', 'whacky', 'situations', 'such', 'exploding', 'microwavable', 'moon', 'pies', 'covering', 'front', 'shirt', 'segment', 'where', 'fight', 'wife', 'driving', 'school', 'late', 'night', 'falling', 'asleep', 'pajamas', 'middle', 'classroom', 'only', 'awake', 'morning', 'surrounded', 'laughing', 'kids', 'making', 'fun', 'way', 'dressed', '.I', 'suppose', 'cool', 'teacher', 'would', 'be', 'inspiration', 'someone', 'around', '12', 'years', 'old', 'watching', 'movie', 'School', 'Life', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'family', 'movie', 'Also', 'feel', 'storyline', 'incomplete', 'concerning', 'teacher', 'year', 'award', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'movie', 'feels', 'important', 'fitting', 'conclusion', 'School', 'Life', 'kids']",School of Life

946100,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,B000BO0L90,General Breadbasket,"[8, 12]","""School of Life"" is a sweet little dramatic comedy, full of things to laugh, smile and think about.Dylan Warner (Andrew Robb) is a pretty average but awkward junior high kid. He has his classes, he has his friends, he plays sports and he has a crush on a girl who's way too pretty and confident for him (played by Shylo Sharity) But he's different from the other kids in a couple of ways. His grandfather (John Astin) is a teacher at his school, and so is his father (David Paymer). His grampa, Stormin' Norman Warner is a warm, popular teacher, who has won the Most Popular Teacher award for decades, while his Dad, Mr Warner, is a strict, stressed and uptight teacher of biology. One sad day, his grampa dies, in the middle of accepting yet another most popular teacher award. In his grief, Mr Warner promises to win the award the next year, to honor his father, Stormin' Norman. He tries to be something the students like, but being as uptight and strict as he is, his efforts aren't that successful. The winner of the award this year is more likely to come to Michael D'Angelo (Ryan Reynolds), - ""Mr D."" to his students, his fellow teachers and even his friends. He's a history teacher: young, charismatic and fun. Most importantly of all, all students under him all get top grades in the standardized tests. Mr Warner is jealous and baffled, why does everyone like this guy so much? Mr Warner tries to outdo Mr D, tries to sabotage him, follows him home, tries to dig up dirt on him. The only thing he manages to do is get his son humiliated in front of his friends. Still, Mr Warner keeps digging, and eventually stumbles upon something Mr D has been keeping a secret, and it breaks Mr Warner's heart when he finds out just what that secret is.I'm a sucker for films about school, I really am. This film is really well cast, has plenty of laughs, good dramatic moments, and great little messages. At my high school, there were all sorts of teachers. Some were really strict, some were easy going and lenient. I even had a sports teacher who graded you according to effort rather than on how well you played, which was really cool. But there was one thing they all had in common, even if I didn't know it all the time, they all cared and they all wanted to be heard. Seeing this film, I have a greater appreciation for what they were trying to do, even the stricter ones. You can see, through Mr Warner's characters, how strict teachers really do mean well, even if it isn't natural in their personalities to be super kid friendly. It also shows how they can play to their strengths too. I also knew a few kids who had parents teaching at their school, carefully balancing on the thin social line and I think Andrew Robb, who played Dyland Warner, captured that well.It's warm, it's witty and just plain good.

946101,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000BO0L90,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[5, 6]","SCHOOL OF LIFE is an original ABC Family television movie which aired in 2005, and, until I saw my brother's dvd copy, I had never heard of it. I popped it in, thinking that it might be an interesting movie, given that I get a kick out of watching the always entertaining Ryan Reynolds. But, like most of the reviewers here, I wasn't counting on this film reaching me on a richer, more emotional plane.David Paymer is great as Matt Warner, the insecure, fussy middle school biology teacher who's forever lived in the shadow of his father, Stormin' Norman Warner (John Astin), himself a teacher at the same school and who had won the annual, student-voted Teacher of the Year Award for 43 years running. Now Matt has a teenage son named Dylan (Andrew Robb, who provides the film's voice-over narration) who frequents the same school, with whom Matt struggles to connect. Like most kids, Dylan is embarassed of his dad, who he thinks is a geek. When Stormin' Norman passes away, Matt promises Dylan that, this year, he'll win the Teacher of the Year trophy. That plan is immediately placed in jeopardy with the opening school day intro of new history instructor, Michael D'Angelo (Ryan Reynolds). The cool and funny D'Angelo, with his unorthodox teaching methods and a life philosophy that go beyond classroom restrictions, promptly wins over the students and earns him the honorific of ""Mr. D,"" much to Matt Warner's dismay.The film then adopts a sit-com plot at length as Matt, jealous of Mr. D's popularity and seeing his chances for the Teacher of the Year Award circling down the drain, manically attempts to gain some dirt on the guy. What he discovers about D'Angelo, instead, shocks him and sobers him up fairly quickly, forcing him to re-evaluate not only his feelings about Mr. D but also to reassess his own life.SCHOOL OF LIFE is a humble, little film that has a lot to offer, including a message about living life to the fullest. It'll, for sure, make you smile and chuckle, but, then, as you go deeper into the movie, it'll also make you sad as events take a gut-wrenching turn. But the bittersweet elements definitely will make it resonate more strongly within you.SCHOOL OF LIFE, much like FOOLPROOF (2003), showcases a Ryan Reynolds with more acting gravitas. Yes, he still provides his usual brand of humorous bits and, make no mistake, he is the heart of the funny, but his comedy is elevated by his strong, underlying dramatic performance, which then takes over in the film's latter half. This blend of humor and sensitivity is what really carries the movie, because you can't really commit to the story unless you buy into Reynolds' character. Paymer, as I've said, is great as the fastidious bio teacher, although, later on, his character does end up borrowing too much from the page of Mr. D. But, good job, Paymer and Van Wilder. A decent supporting turn, also, by Kate Vernon, who plays Paymer's supporting and understanding wife.So, yes, this film is definitely worth your backing. I've said this before somewhere else: enough credit cannot be given to movies like SCHOOL OF LIFE, which reenforces the importance of teachers as educators, nurturers, and as inspiration for our kids. You just can't underestimate the value and the impact of a caring, innovative teacher who truly tries to make a difference. As a side note, if you like SCHOOL OF LIFE, check out THE RON CLARK STORY, another inspirational movie about a teacher.",4,"Excellent school film, as Ryan Reynolds grows up even more",1165017600,"12 2, 2006",2006,3450,"['SCHOOL', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'original', 'ABC', 'Family', 'television', 'movie', 'aired', '2005', 'saw', 'brother', 'dvd', 'copy', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'popped', 'thinking', 'might', 'be', 'interesting', 'movie', 'given', 'get', 'kick', 'watching', 'always', 'entertaining', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'most', 'reviewers', 'here', 'was', ""n't"", 'counting', 'film', 'reaching', 'richer', 'more', 'emotional', 'plane.David', 'Paymer', 'great', 'Matt', 'Warner', 'insecure', 'fussy', 'middle', 'school', 'biology', 'teacher', 'who', 'forever', 'lived', 'shadow', 'father', 'Stormin', 'Norman', 'Warner', 'John', 'Astin', 'teacher', 'same', 'school', 'who', 'had', 'won', 'annual', 'student-voted', 'Teacher', 'Year', 'Award', '43', 'years', 'running', 'Now', 'Matt', 'teenage', 'son', 'named', 'Dylan', 'Andrew', 'Robb', 'who', 'film', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'who', 'same', 'school', 'whom', 'Matt', 'connect', 'most', 'kids', 'Dylan', 'embarassed', 'dad', 'who', 'geek', 'When', 'Stormin', 'Norman', 'away', 'Matt', 'Dylan', 'year', ""'ll"", 'win', 'Teacher', 'Year', 'trophy', 'plan', 'immediately', 'placed', 'jeopardy', 'opening', 'school', 'day', 'intro', 'new', 'history', 'instructor', 'Michael', ""D'Angelo"", 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'cool', 'funny', ""D'Angelo"", 'unorthodox', 'teaching', 'methods', 'life', 'philosophy', 'go', 'classroom', 'restrictions', 'promptly', 'students', 'honorific', 'Mr.', 'D', 'much', 'Matt', 'Warner', 'dismay.The', 'film', 'then', 'sit-com', 'plot', 'length', 'Matt', 'jealous', 'Mr.', 'D', 'popularity', 'seeing', 'chances', 'Teacher', 'Year', 'Award', 'circling', 'down', 'drain', 'manically', 'attempts', 'gain', 'dirt', 'guy', 'What', ""D'Angelo"", 'instead', 'sobers', 'up', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'forcing', 're-evaluate', 'not', 'only', 'feelings', 'Mr.', 'D', 'also', 'reassess', 'own', 'life.SCHOOL', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'humble', 'little', 'film', 'lot', 'offer', 'including', 'message', 'living', 'life', 'fullest', ""'ll"", 'sure', 'make', 'smile', 'chuckle', 'then', 'go', 'deeper', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'also', 'make', 'sad', 'events', 'take', 'gut-wrenching', 'turn', 'bittersweet', 'elements', 'definitely', 'will', 'make', 'resonate', 'more', 'strongly', 'you.SCHOOL', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'much', 'FOOLPROOF', '2003', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'more', 'acting', 'gravitas', 'Yes', 'still', 'usual', 'brand', 'humorous', 'bits', 'make', 'mistake', 'heart', 'funny', 'comedy', 'elevated', 'strong', 'underlying', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'then', 'over', 'film', 'latter', 'half', 'blend', 'humor', 'sensitivity', 'what', 'really', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'commit', 'story', 'buy', 'Reynolds', 'character', 'Paymer', ""'ve"", 'said', 'great', 'fastidious', 'bio', 'teacher', 'later', 'character', 'end', 'up', 'borrowing', 'too', 'much', 'page', 'Mr.', 'D.', 'good', 'job', 'Paymer', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'decent', 'supporting', 'turn', 'also', 'Kate', 'Vernon', 'who', 'Paymer', 'supporting', 'understanding', 'wife.So', 'yes', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'backing', ""'ve"", 'said', 'somewhere', 'else', 'enough', 'credit', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'given', 'movies', 'SCHOOL', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'importance', 'teachers', 'educators', 'nurturers', 'inspiration', 'kids', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'underestimate', 'value', 'impact', 'caring', 'innovative', 'teacher', 'who', 'truly', 'make', 'difference', 'side', 'note', 'like', 'SCHOOL', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'check', 'out', 'THE', 'RON', 'CLARK', 'STORY', 'inspirational', 'movie', 'teacher']",School of Life

If you ever want proof how a relatively low budget movie blow away movies with a 100 million price tag, look no further. The reason is simply extraordinarily good writing, and a good cast as well.The movie really illustrates how important it is to live your life the best you can, while you can. It's a similar movie to, but far better than, ""Dead Poets Society"". The story focuses on a boring, socially awkward junior high biology teacher who is very unpopular with his students, and not highly respected by his son. He has also been living in the shadow of both his father (who was the most popular teacher in his school's history) and a new teacher at the school with an unorthodox style that is stealing all the student's attention. The story focuses on how this man finally breaks out on his own, and turns his life around. Whether he acts like a jerk, or becomes the hero, you will cheer him at every step.The movie is not perfect and includes the ""nerdy guy gets the popular girl storyline"", which is a cliche you see too often in films about school life.

946103,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,B000BO0L90,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[0, 1]","David Paymer. Now who would have thought he could be cast as the lead actor in a film? He's not eye candy. He's not young and vibrant. He's not Gibson or Martin or Lawrence or any other famous middle-aged actor. He's just your average guy. In ""School of Life,"" he's your average teacher struggling to be excellent. However, he lacks IT, whatever IT is to make students LOVE his class. More than anything, he wants be that great teacher with classes filled with enthusiastic students.Across the hall is Mr. D, played to perfection by Ryan Reynolds. He IS that teacher--young, handsome, athletic, and so innovative that students LOVE him and his classes. Of course, Mr. Warner is jealous. Even his own father, as an educator, won Teacher of the Year, forty-something times during a long career.Spoiler alert:Mr D won't have forty-something years. He has inoperable lung cancer. So, does this become a maudlin movie, for it could, but no, Director William Dear presents a thoughtful picture of this young teacher, told with just the right attitude. David Paymer's last little speech is perfect. ""Mr. D is with us. Every teacher you've ever had is with you, sharing his knowledge."" There's more in this speech, adding the soothing, verbal medication to hurting hearts. However, I encourage the reader to see this film respectful of hard-working teachers, patient and impatient students, and major obstacles that can stop us dead.Normally, teacher movies annoy me with their silly pretense of one class for one teacher, corrupt administrations, cruel and incompetent teachers, and criminally insane students. This time the director gets it right, even though teachers still seem to have just one class.

946104,A2NM151WE06TZB,B000BO0L90,Katipo,"[2, 11]","Ryan Reynolds plays a smarmy, crowd pleasing new teacher who immediately bonds with all the angelic waifs in this fairytale of a school. He wins them over by being their buddy, finds the time (and money) to kit himself out as an indian chief, and even re-inacts a civil war in the playground (complete with black powder rifles). His destiny is clear from the moment he blurts out, ""How much time do we have? Not much..."". David Paymer is the comic relief, all that's missing is the floppy shoes and clown makeup. There is also the usual puppy love sub-plot with the not so awful young actor Andrew Robb, just a shame that the plot has nowhere to go.The entire film reeks of trite, moralistic falseness. If this were just a comedy then it wouldn't matter how silly it was (accounting for your tastes), but it tries to aim too high and preach to us the meaning of life. I'm guessing this was targeted at younger audiences by the studio, but give the kids some credit, they can spot a stinker a mile away. We just need more people to be bothered leaving honest reviews (not just the fans) to lower the feedback to a realistic score, so people don't get suckered into buying such drivel.If you want truly decent teacher/student heartwarming stories (without the schmaltz), try ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"" (the remake is good too), or ""Mr Holland's Opus"".
