910519,AK0CENM3LUM28,B0009PLMAS,Amazon Customer,"[41, 50]","Place Promised in Our Early Days / B0009PLMAS*Spoilers*The problem with philosophical movies is that one person's ""Oh my, wasn't that deep and mysterious"" moment is another person's ""Good grief, this is boring, tedious, and inane"", and sometimes there's just no rhyme or reason to it besides differences in character, history, and experiences between the two people. And then the person who didn't like the film goes on Amazon and explains why they didn't like it in order to aid people in their purchasing decisions, and inevitably comes off looking like a jerk for 'hating' on someone's favorite movie.And yet, here we are. I wanted to like ""Place Promised"", I really did. Firstly, and while this shouldn't *matter*, it's still very impressive, the movie is absolutely gorgeous. Seriously, this is some of the prettiest anime I've ever seen - there's a scene where a ladybug alights on a girl's hand, and it's so lovely I just want to cry. And, really, I *love* the plot premise - the horror of being totally alone in an alternate reality that you can't wake from is exactly the kind of plot premise that messes deeply with your mind for weeks on end. As well as the dual persona of the two boys - do they save their friend and risk the world, or do they sacrifice an innocent for mankind?So why two stars? Honestly, despite all this I just didn't enjoy the movie. The characters are so bland and badly characterized that I couldn't get into it and just ended up being frustrated. The boys in particular stand out for me - their characters are so poorly fleshed out, and so superficially similar, that I actually thought a Big Reveal was going to be that they were both two personalities for the same person, a laFight Club, but no - it just turned out that they were poorly characterized and I wasn't supposed to notice.The horror angle, also, which seemed so promising, was badly botched for me by the handling and execution. I don't demand complete realism in movies, but it would be nice to have SOME kind of Applied Phlebotinum to explain why all this is happening, outside of a bland, ""Well, her grandfather worked on the tower..."", explanation that explains nothing. Not to mention that the horror fell kind of flat when the researchers discovered so quickly and blandly what was going on - it's hard to feel that she's isolated and alone when everyone in the outside world knows her situation (even if that distinction doesn't make a difference to her).Indeed, so MUCH of this movie just seems to be a ""Simon says"" of narrative acceptance. The populace at large regard the tower to be little more than an uncomfortable reminder of war or a lovely piece of scenery, which is so inhumanly bovine as to hurl you out of the movie on a catapult. I mean, imagine if we had a brutal war with Mexico or Cuba and then afterward they built a tower that stretched as far as the eye could see and could, oh I-don't-know, be used to stage long-range attacks against us at any point in time. I'm pretty sure the population's overall feeling towards it wouldn't be 'oooh, it's so shiny today!'. That's not even getting into the whole parallel universe thing - why would you want to overlap our world with a parallel universe? What's the goal? The point? Why is the government funding this operation? How did the tower sync up with our poor, beleaguered girl? We don't get answers to these things and while some people are going to find the lack of answers to be ""deep"" and ""meaningful"", it just rubbed me wrong in this particular case.And, really, my intention is not to troll. If you loved this movie, good on you. But if you haven't seen this movie yet and are considering buying it at full price, take this review as a recommendation to rent first.

Not as good as its prequal, Voices of a Distant Star, but noteworthy nonetheless. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes touching stories. I also recommend this movie because it's the first major release of Japan's newest and greatest anime director, Makoto Shinkai. This young director has a gift for storytelling and a way of getting his point across that is lost in a lot of weaker anime. Love stories are good, but actually displaying the obvious love between the characters is very important. Makoto Shinkai does this in both his films, The Placed Promised in Our early Days and Voices of a Distant Star, making us not only believe in these character but wish that something would happen to bring them together. He's a master storyteller, and I can't wait to see what he's planning next. Look out Hayao Miyazaki.

910521,AGO5LRUVQLH0Q,B0009PLMAS,A. Schneider,"[8, 8]","This movie features and follows a number of characters as it unfolds, but the main characters are two youngsters (a male and a female) who have feelings for one another in a pre-war Japan. Seemingly oblivious to the turmoil erupting, they both look off into the sky toward a huge, thin, silver sliver of hope - the ""tower.""As the story unfolds we learn that the tower links dimensions and is somehow threatening to destroy the world as we know it. Erupting warfare also occurs but all this is handled like a background story - for the main characters are still intent upon reaching their ""promised land"" (the land essentially surrounding the tower, encompassing the tower as well).The bulk of the story takes place after the children have grown up and mysteriously the female character that one of the main male characters was attracted to in his youth suddenly falls into a coma. Without giving any more away, this story is about reaching her in much the same way Voices of a Distant Star was about the communication between two young loves across a war and worlds.Thematic elements are similar between Voices of a Distant Star and The Place Promised in Our Early Days. Both movies feature innocent love, the battle of love lost, and a supportive art style which contributes to Shinkai's film's emotionally engaging story.Shinkai does it again this time out-doing himself with amazing animation, soundtrack, and excellent captivating and emotional storyline. Between Voices of a Distant Star and The Place Promised in Our Early Days, Makoto Shinkai proves himself as one of the greatest Japanese animators. Extras show his transition from working solo to working with a whole team... his transition also marks a transition in his work from simply amazing to downright unparalleled.In my opinion the plot was not all that confusing, what was slightly confusing was the order in which the older versions of the young characters appeared in the story. When the progression in time was made I mistook various characters for what I thought was their older counterparts, this was a mistake on my part but one which I think would be common since the real main male character (Hiroki), as an adult, was introduced much later than I expected.There was one review in which the reviewer stated how the subtitles in the American DVD version of the film were off, this is incorrect... there are no flaws on the DVD whatsoever, and simply to make sure I triple checked the subtitles on the copy of the DVD which I own (a simple task for me), not a single error. Either the reviewer was not referring to this edition of the DVD or a later revision of the DVD was released after his review was posted.This is a great film I think all fans of anime would benefit from seeing (and enjoy quite a bit), I highly doubt there is any difference like some reviewers suggest in a Japanese audiences opinion compared to the American audiences opinion - love, innocent love is innocent love - I think that the intelligent viewer and anime enthusiast will enjoy this film just as much as I have.Remarkable work of art!",5,A Remarkable Work of Art...,1132272000,"11 18, 2005",2005,3091,"['movie', 'number', 'characters', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'two', 'youngsters', 'male', 'female', 'who', 'have', 'feelings', 'one', 'pre-war', 'Japan', 'Seemingly', 'oblivious', 'turmoil', 'erupting', 'look', 'off', 'sky', 'huge', 'thin', 'silver', 'sliver', 'hope', 'tower', 'story', 'learn', 'tower', 'links', 'dimensions', 'somehow', 'threatening', 'destroy', 'world', 'know', 'Erupting', 'warfare', 'also', 'handled', 'background', 'story', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'still', 'intent', 'reaching', 'promised', 'land', 'land', 'essentially', 'surrounding', 'tower', 'encompassing', 'tower', 'well', '.The', 'bulk', 'story', 'place', 'children', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'mysteriously', 'female', 'character', 'one', 'main', 'male', 'characters', 'was', 'attracted', 'youth', 'suddenly', 'coma', 'giving', 'more', 'away', 'story', 'reaching', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Voices', 'Distant', 'Star', 'was', 'communication', 'two', 'young', 'loves', 'war', 'worlds.Thematic', 'elements', 'are', 'similar', 'Voices', 'Distant', 'Star', 'Place', 'Promised', 'Early', 'Days', 'movies', 'feature', 'innocent', 'love', 'battle', 'love', 'lost', 'supportive', 'art', 'style', 'Shinkai', 'film', 'emotionally', 'engaging', 'story.Shinkai', 'again', 'time', 'out-doing', 'amazing', 'animation', 'soundtrack', 'excellent', 'captivating', 'emotional', 'storyline', 'Between', 'Voices', 'Distant', 'Star', 'Place', 'Promised', 'Early', 'Days', 'Makoto', 'Shinkai', 'one', 'greatest', 'Japanese', 'animators', 'Extras', 'show', 'transition', 'working', 'solo', 'working', 'whole', 'team', 'transition', 'also', 'transition', 'work', 'simply', 'amazing', 'downright', 'unparalleled.In', 'opinion', 'plot', 'was', 'not', 'confusing', 'what', 'was', 'slightly', 'confusing', 'was', 'order', 'older', 'versions', 'young', 'characters', 'appeared', 'story', 'When', 'progression', 'time', 'was', 'made', 'mistook', 'various', 'characters', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'older', 'counterparts', 'was', 'mistake', 'part', 'one', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'common', 'real', 'main', 'male', 'character', 'Hiroki', 'adult', 'was', 'introduced', 'much', 'later', 'expected.There', 'was', 'one', 'review', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'how', 'subtitles', 'American', 'DVD', 'version', 'film', 'were', 'off', 'incorrect', 'are', 'flaws', 'DVD', 'whatsoever', 'simply', 'make', 'sure', 'triple', 'checked', 'subtitles', 'copy', 'DVD', 'own', 'simple', 'task', 'not', 'single', 'error', 'reviewer', 'was', 'not', 'referring', 'edition', 'DVD', 'later', 'revision', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', 'review', 'was', 'posted.This', 'great', 'film', 'think', 'fans', 'anime', 'would', 'benefit', 'seeing', 'enjoy', 'quite', 'bit', 'highly', 'doubt', 'difference', 'reviewers', 'suggest', 'Japanese', 'audiences', 'opinion', 'compared', 'American', 'audiences', 'opinion', 'love', 'innocent', 'love', 'innocent', 'think', 'intelligent', 'viewer', 'anime', 'enthusiast', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'have.Remarkable', 'work', 'art']",The Place Promised in Our Early Days
910522,AM9YB0BKXFH7Z,B0009PLMAS,"B. Ackley ""jumpstudios""","[1, 1]","Makoto Shinkai makes beautiful films. Sun drenched skies, gorgeous clouds and wind-swept fields are all part of his signature style and every film he makes is truly amazing. He also makes very smart anime films. His works are not typical mecha slug fests, samurai beat em ups or silly harem shows that often make up the bulk of anime content. Instead, his films are more introspective, thought provoking and solicit an emotional response from the viewer. I have been a fan of his work since ""voices of a distant star"" and after watching ""children who chase lost voices"" I decided to go back and re-watch his previous works. After viewing it again ""the place promised in our early days"" is in my opinion his weakest.""The place promised.."" is a science fiction story about an alternate history where Japan is split into north and south. The north has constructed a mysterious tower that can be seen by everyone in the south. Three school friends dream about what the tower is and build a plane in hopes of flying to the tower. As time moves on the dynamics of friendship changes and the promise to go to the tower fades as life changes. What makes this film so weak is indeed the characterization and pacing. The two main male characters are never fully fleshed out, the female character is presented as a weaker girl and we never really get the sense that any of them are great friends. In fact there isn't a real deep connection between any of the characters. Instead of character development we are treated to long scenes filled with gorgeous landscapes, train stations and endless soliloquies. While the characters inner thoughts give us an idea of how they view their world there's very little happening in the film and the plot itself never fully materializes. In between these character speeches Makoto adds scenes filled with political and science fiction jargon but those scenes while giving us info about the tower aren't quite cohesive enough to pull the story together.Overall, the film is absolutely gorgeous but for me was not entertaining. There are lots of great anime films that are able to be philosophical as well as entertain. Certainly films by Satoshi Kon and Katsuhiro Otomo works are evident of that. Having said that this was the first full length film by Makoto Shinkai and his abilities as a storyteller were growing. His next two films ""5cm per second"" and ""children who chase lost voices"" proved to be amazing films.

In fact, the plot seems so incomplete, the characters so flat, that it's almost too much to bear. But through the almost instant bewilderment the viewer is bound to experience, and through the frustrating lack of real character substance... the overall dreaminess of the movie and the purity of those simple characters' motives shines so brightly as to obscure 'Promised...'s shortcomings.Visually, the movie is breathtaking. The scenery is always incredible -- surreal and super-real at once, vibrant and vast and absolutely gorgeous.

It is true that the story can seem confusing at times, but puzzling out what is happening is actually part of the fun with this movie.  At any rate, the story certainly packs an emotional punch.  Despite the Sci-fi story elements, the emotional realism of the main characters is going to stick with you for days after finishing this movie.",5,Brilliant! Amazing!

910529,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0009PLMAS,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","Back in 2002, Makoto Shinkai won an award as ""Most Valuable Newcomer"" at the Tokyo Anime Fair 21 for his film ""Voices of a Distant Star"".What made this film so different from many anime out there was that it was created only by a staff of one and that was Shinkai Makoto, himself.Using a Power Macintosh 7600/120 computer and various consumer and professional design and animation software, he was able to write, direct and create an animation so beautiful that it was difficult to believe that one man was responsible for it.Now, Makoto is back with another award winning animated film titled ""The Place Promised In Our Early Days"".The film takes place after the Second World War, with Japan now divided into two factions.Honshu and the rest of the Southern Islands came under the sovereignty of the United States and Hokkaido was annexed by ""Union"".In 1996, an unsual tower was created South of Honshu and Its purpose is unkown.In the Aomori prefecture (Northern Japan), the storyline focuses on three friends  who made a vow to fly an airplane to the tower and find out its secrets.Two programmers and their friend Sayuri made a promise that was meant to be kept until something happened to Sayuri and the promise was broken.The film features three main parts.  Focusing on the characters as they make the promise.The next focuses on the lives of the individuals three years later, on how a broken promise has set two of the main characters into two different paths in their lives, one working for the Southern Islands as a master hacker and the other who has not fully adjusted because his love for Sayuri and feels empty without her.And the third and final part which focuses on the two friends as they are put into opposing paths and the answer to Sayuri's connection with the tower.If you thought Makoto Shinkai did amazing things with his first film, ""The Place Promised In Our Early Days"" is a glimpse of what Makoto can do with a full staff and potential for the future.  Absolutely amazing!The attention to detail on the animation is very well done.  There is strong attention to detail for buildings, outdoor scenery and vehicles which are well done.Even the audio was a pleasure to listen to and the surround sound is well done.I've heard noises may it be rain or subtle noises used effectively on my rear speakers.  Very nice!Of course, with a beautiful looking and sounding film, it wouldn't make a whole lot of difference if the storyline is bad.

But to be honest none of his other films have captivated me the way that one did... not even close in fact.I thought this one started out well.  A nice sense of nostalgia... a promised place & time I think anyone that's once been young (and haven't we all?) could relate to.  But when it changed gears and started going on about parallel universes it was as if I was suddenly watching a completely different film.

910534,A3F9VH8916IA40,B0009PLMAS,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[1, 1]","The Place Promised in Our Early Days plays a lot like whatVoices of a Distant Starcould have been had it been a full length film as opposed to a 23 minute short. Set in an alternate world where Japan has been split in two after the Second World War, the US controls the southern end, while a mysterious government known as the Union controls the north. Located in the north is the mystical Union Tower, an enormous structure jutting into the sky like a beam of light, a symbol of love and hate for those who gaze upon its magnificent height. This is the coming of age story of three middle school children Hiroki, Takuya, and Sayuri, who grew up their whole lives dreaming of visiting the tower and spent their time building an airplane in order to do just that.The first thirty minutes of this film are very stunning, both visually and emotionally. It plays out almost exactly like Voices of a Distant Star does, with stunning animation, peaceful and touching music and the characters relationships with each other being the focus of the film. although the story itself doesn't stand up to scrawny and seems as if it were hacked together without much thought put into it, the combination of the visuals and the musical score are very moving. Few animes have actually wowed me with their animation,Spirited Awaywas one such movie; this took the cake. This movie has the most stunning animation I have ever seen in an animated film, bar none. its hard to explain with words just what I mean, the sun setting behind the glow of the Union Tower, far off streaks of light shining off an airplane, a small white dove flying in a cool breeze as trees sway around it, its all done with such dedication and detail that it left me speechless. Combined with one of the best soundtracks ever composed for a feature film and this movie have the power to bring people to tears on its sheer beauty alone. Could this be the new Miyazaki? I said no in my Voices of a Distant Star review, but if this is what this new director is capable of then he may be.Unfortunately, this movies story is very hacked up, as if during many points of this film the director intended to end it and just decided to add more later. This movie has more endings thenThe Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King (Widescreen Edition). While I love the ending this movie had, the rest of the film didn't flow the way a feature length film should, it didn't transfer smoothly from one scene to the next; instead it simply ended a scene with a black screen, and started up somewhere else completely without setting up the next shot. This caused the story to feel clumsy, as if the director didn't know where he wanted to go or what he wanted to do once he got there. The middle part of this movie just sort of plods along without any real sense of direction. It's like he wanted to make a short film, like Voices of a Distant Star, but decided to stretch it out as far as he could. The movie really could have been half and hour, or more, shorter then it was. Not to say that most of it is filler, but if he managed to fit a story the size and scope of Voices into 23 minutes, then I'm sure he could have fit this movie into 40. Also, a lot of the movie is never really explained. What is the Union Tower exactly? What is the Union? Why is there such a desire for the two nations to go to war? All these questions are left unanswered at the end of the film. It is only when this film focuses mainly on the story instead of on creating beautiful images and developing its characters that it gets dull. there really isn't much story to hold this movie together during its slower and less grand moments, which becomes a problem 3/4ths of the way though when the story takes front stage in all its hacked up glory. Fortunately, the director seems to know this and keeps the story in the background as much as possibly, only bringing it into focus when he needs to get the characters from point A to point B.What saves this movie from being nothing more then a good looking and sounding mess (likeAkira (Special Edition)) was the relationships between the characters involved. Much like in Voices, this story is a romance of sorts but doesn't fall into the ""chick flick"" category. It's about the love three friends have for each other, and the length they were willing to go for each other in order to fulfill a promise they made while still little kids. It's very interesting to watch how each slowly fell into depression and felt like their lives were losing meaning when they weren't with each other. When one of themes disappears, they lose their dreams, ambitions, and slowly drift apart. Like any good piece of fiction, the characters are what make this movie so touching.If you enjoyed Voices of a Distant Star, then you will enjoy The Place Promised in Our Early Days. Its visuals, characters, and soundtrack make this movies a must see for sure, but its hacked up story prevents it from being a truly great film. If this director can learn how to write a story that can match up with his amazing animation, then watch out world, anime might very well have a new director to take the place of the great Miyazaki when he finally retires. I look forward to seeing more movies by this upcoming guineas.Re-play value; high.",4,"Beautiful, Poetic, and Moving visuals, but Bad Pacing Keeps this from Being Great",1196726400,"12 4,

The story follows two boys (Hiroki and Takuya) who both like the same girl (Sayuri).  At the beginning of the film, they areall 8th grade students.  The boys find the remains of a drone plane, which they have named the Bella Ciela.  They take part-time jobs at a factory, where their boss helps them scrounge for spare parts to rebuild the drone plane.  The boys promise Sayuri that after the plane is rebuilt, they will take her to visit the mysterious tower on Hokkaido.  However, before this happens, Sayuri mysteriously disappears.It's three years later, and the boys have stopped working on the plane.  One of them is now a student in Tokyo, while the other is working as a physicist.  Meanwhile, Sayuri has been hospitalized due to an extreme form of narcolepsy.  It is believed her condition has something to do with the tower on Hokkaido.  Both of the boys learn what has happened to Sayuri, but have very different ideas what needs to be done. They need to decide whether it's more important to save Sayuri or save the world.The animation in the film is lush and very realistic-looking.

910539,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B0009PLMAS,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[0, 0]","This review is not intended as the final word on this film -- but primarily just a quick note to say that reviews making comparisons with Miyazaki should not mislead you into thinking this film will be as well-appreciated or understood by children as Miyazaki's films.  Obviously, there are several fans of anime who love this film, and I can see some of the reasons why.  I got this film, though, mostly for my children who love everything they have seen from Studio Ghibli, and did so on the strength of comparisons in the reviews posted here and elsewhere with the work of Miyazaki.  As it turned out, though, my kids became quite bored halfway through this film and lost interest in seeing it to the end.  I kept it on, but found myself drifting a bit as well.The visuals were stunning -- as good as any I have seen in animation. I also thought the story held promise and was overall touching, but also suffered from what seemed to me to be contradictory aims.  On the one hand, the filmmakers seemed to want a simple story about childhood friendships and dreams, that can be lost sight of for a time but possibly recaptured.  On the other hand, the filmmakers wanted a strong science fiction premise that explored the possibility of alternate realities.  I don't think either aspect worked as well as it could have.  The plot is not really, though, the main problem that I saw with this film; I think it had more to do with a feeling that the characters never felt to me as if they had been brought to life.  Some of the early sequences reminded me of the simple evocations of childhood and wonder found in Studio Ghibli's ""Whisper of the Heart"" -- but what carried that movie all the way through was the personalities and overall interest of the characters.  By contrast, I never felt very connected to the characters in this film, and my children didn't either.  My children's response to the film did not seem to have as much to do with the complicated storyline as its failure to create truly memorable and likeable characters.  Shinkai is a talented artist who creates beautiful and inspiring images, and I will certainly keep an eye out for his future films -- I hope that in the future he can collaborate with a storyteller who can help him bring his stories to life through the characters.",3,Stunning animation - but story was not very engaging,1165968000,"12 13, 2006",2006,2302,"['review', 'not', 'intended', 'final', 'word', 'film', 'primarily', 'just', 'quick', 'note', 'say', 'making', 'comparisons', 'Miyazaki', 'should', 'not', 'mislead', 'thinking', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'well-appreciated', 'understood', 'children', 'Miyazaki', 'films', 'Obviously', 'are', 'several', 'fans', 'anime', 'who', 'love', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'reasons', 'why', 'got', 'film', 'though', 'mostly', 'children', 'who', 'love', 'everything', 'have', 'seen', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'did', 'so', 'strength', 'comparisons', 'reviews', 'posted', 'here', 'elsewhere', 'work', 'Miyazaki', 'turned', 'out', 'though', 'kids', 'became', 'quite', 'bored', 'halfway', 'film', 'lost', 'interest', 'seeing', 'end', 'kept', 'found', 'drifting', 'bit', 'well.The', 'visuals', 'were', 'stunning', 'as', 'good', 'have', 'seen', 'animation', 'also', 'thought', 'story', 'held', 'promise', 'was', 'overall', 'touching', 'also', 'suffered', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'contradictory', 'aims', 'one', 'hand', 'filmmakers', 'seemed', 'want', 'simple', 'story', 'childhood', 'friendships', 'dreams', 'can', 'be', 'lost', 'sight', 'time', 'possibly', 'recaptured', 'other', 'hand', 'filmmakers', 'wanted', 'strong', 'science', 'fiction', 'premise', 'explored', 'possibility', 'alternate', 'realities', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'aspect', 'worked', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'plot', 'not', 'really', 'main', 'problem', 'saw', 'film', 'think', 'had', 'more', 'do', 'feeling', 'characters', 'never', 'felt', 'had', 'been', 'brought', 'life', 'early', 'sequences', 'reminded', 'simple', 'evocations', 'childhood', 'wonder', 'found', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'what', 'carried', 'movie', 'way', 'was', 'personalities', 'overall', 'interest', 'characters', 'contrast', 'never', 'felt', 'very', 'connected', 'characters', 'film', 'children', 'did', ""n't"", 'either', 'children', 'response', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'complicated', 'storyline', 'failure', 'create', 'truly', 'memorable', 'likeable', 'characters', 'Shinkai', 'talented', 'artist', 'who', 'beautiful', 'inspiring', 'images', 'will', 'certainly', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'future', 'films', 'hope', 'future', 'can', 'collaborate', 'storyteller', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'bring', 'stories', 'life', 'characters']",The Place Promised in Our Early Days

910543,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,B0009PLMAS,Spider Monkey,"[1, 1]","`The Place Promised In Our Early Days' is another masterful animation from Makoto Shinkai. This follows three young adults as they live in the time just before a war and how one of them, Sayuri, is linked to a tall tower they can see in the distance and which is connected to the coming conflict. This film looks at a promise made and how it is finally carried out. It is hard to give more detail without spoiling the film. This film has some beautiful animation, especially the backgrounds and the attention to detail is very impressive. The play of sunlight on objects and as characters move through sunlight really stood out. This has more traditional animation than in Shinkai's previous film `Voices of a Distant Star' (which had lots of obviously computer animated scenes) and I found it easier to watch as a result. This film has some wonderful 'camera' angles and scenes that made it feel more cinematic and like a film than an anime, it feels very polished and well thought out. This has a slight romantic edge to the story and softened the more hard edge, military themed aspects of the film and complimented it very well overall.

910544,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B0009PLMAS,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[1, 1]","Motoko Shinkai has been hailed as the greatest animation genius to come out of Japan since Miyazaki himself. He made his first widely hailed success on his iMac and did the voice-acting himself. It was called Voices of a Distant Star, at less than an hour in length, it was the greatest story of light-speed time-delay since Gunbuster, a Mecha sci-fi that focused on two (literally) star-crossed lovers and their battle against time and for the salvation of the human race, when all they really wanted was to be together. Every since that film, people have been clamoring for more of that magic. Well the day has come, complete with orchestral music, and a full motion-picture budget. Was the first feature-length vision of the great Shinkai worth waiting for? Yes indeed!Voices of a Distant Star was an epic in miniature, a tale of love between the stars expressed through time and space on a cell phone (literally!). It struck a chord with myriads of fans across the globe by making the epic extremely personal, making us wonder if the love between two teenagers in the end might be more important than a war across the universe. No Shinkai again creates a deeply personal epic, but of a slightly different nature. Both films create an enormous feeling of lonliness as star-crossed loves drift apart and a quiet desperation sinks in, Voices was highly tragic, while the feeling this film conveys is more one of triumph and salvation, through the belief that there is still time to fulfill life's promises, and there is always the chance to start again.At its outset the film introduces us to a world where Japan is divided much the way German once was, with the two sides locked in a cold war. On one side are two friends working to build their own aircraft (and the girl who fascinates them both). On the other side lies an immense tower that they want to reach with the plane they are building. It's a peaceful, beautiful, tranquil world, but flashes of future events fill one with a sense or foreboding, just before we fast-forward to a time of impending destruction...The friends grow up and drift apart. One enters into research and the other goes to the city to study at a university. Here the differences in their personalities which were at first subtle now seem like night and day, as the more stoic and studious one is getting involved in the razer-edge political climate and the daydreamer finds himself in danger of completely losing his grip on reality. And that's where the real drama kicks in.You see that mysterious tower is a weapon of mass destruction, capable of rewriting the world with an alternate one...one where there are no people. And somehow that tower is connected to the girl, who has fallen into a deep sleep. But like in Voices of a Distant Star, the real story is one of the connection between two people across time and space, and dimensions. Not long before I saw this film I had an idea. What if our dreams were really a portal to other dimensions? While the two friends are pursuing their destinies, the idealistic one starts to hear her calling to him from far far away, from the dimension where her mind is trapped while her body sleeps. She is all alone and desperately searching for him to save her. And the thought that speaks to me most, is one I see again and again in Japanese stories. Often those who seem weakest are really the strongest. This girl who is so mild, soft-spoken, sweet, and fragile. And the only thing between the world and total annihilation is her will holding back the tower...As she starts to wake up, and the nations head toward all-out war, the friends must reunite, and decide the ultimate fate of the world, as one tries to save the girl he loves, and the other tries to save the world.This film is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen in my life. Voices of a Distant Star was gorgeous, with orange and purple hues over everything making it a world of perpetual sunset. But that short film was made by one man on his iMac. This film was made by a team of animators with a real feature film budget. And it certainly shows. The animation is much higher quality, with less sill shots and more natural-looking characters. Each and every frame is a work of art, with everything bathed in a perpetual sunrise pallet of colors. On a good TV, particularly if you have a progressive-scan dvd player. The music too is quite beautiful, with the main violin theme being perhaps as memorable as the piano them from Voices. Even with the greatly upgraded visuals, you can still very clearly see the director's tradmark style. Often you see objects in close view or tremendous vitas, and the characters are part of the world rather than standing out from it.There are shots where you seem to focus on some small detail such as reflections on a ceiling or glittering lights, the passing of shadows. It gives everything a very dreamlike storybook quality, and I have often thought that Shinkai has to be trying tell the story completely with the visuals, as if we should still understand the feelings, thoughts, and emotions of the characters even without words.Some people might be turned down by some of the more hard sci-fi aspects, such as the talk about alternate dimensions, and the technobabble about building the plane. And doubtless some will grow bored with the slow pace of the film. But the narrative power of Shinkai's creations is hard to ignore, and the visual splendor presented is unsurpassed. This film is nothing short of a masterpiece. I can't wait for Shinkai's next film.",5,Beyond the Clouds,1198281600,"12 22, 2007",2007,5553,"['Motoko', 'Shinkai', 'been', 'hailed', 'greatest', 'animation', 'genius', 'come', 'Japan', 'Miyazaki',

910545,AV1WAYOHXD1MA,B0009PLMAS,"The Pes ""Deerhoads""","[5, 5]","Does a plot have to be complex and so deep with meaning to be great?  Does it have to have a moral message to render it meaningful?  Does it have to entertain with the biggest bombast that you can throw on screen?  I think not.  If your idea of great filmmaking has to answer all these questions with a ""yes,"" then you might be missing the big picture.To start off, ""The Place Promised in Our Early Days"" is not a science fiction film.  Rather, it's a simple story with sci-fi elements.  Yes, the parallel universes plot device sort of comes out of nowhere, feeling a bit tacked on to give validity to the events that happen later on, but it works in the end since it re-enforces what the movie is trying to say:  The greatest promise friends can give, is the promise that they will never stop loving.While the story is not without its flaws, the movie succeeds in the end.  What most people don't get is that there is no real ""enemy"" here.  You can't pinpoint and say ""Ah ha!  I see a bad guy.""  There isn't one.  The real antagonist is the loss of innocence and what people have to do to reconnect to that simplicity that was once in our childhood.  So when people say that there isn't any action in the film, I think that they aren't really looking at what the film is really trying to convey.But the little action that is in here is still pretty to look at.The animation here is top-notch and it harkens back to Shinkai's first work ""Voices..."" but on a much grander scale.  Everything is bright and colorful without being saturated in hyper-vibrancy.  It juxtaposes well with the intimacy that these characters have for each other.The music just adds to this rich palette.  The solo violin piece played through out the film creates this warmth that actually accentuates the colors of the film.  It's hard to describe, but the piece adds its own color to the beautiful animation.Overall, this movie made me realize that a story, as simple as this one, could resonate to anyone that is willing to see the bigger picture.  Friendship, love and the dreams of childhood, transcend the difficulties and realities of life.",5,"Great movie, but please be aware it is not totally sci-fi",1155168000,"08 10, 2006",2006,2120,"['plot', 'have', 'be', 'complex', 'so', 'deep', 'meaning', 'be', 'great', 'have', 'have', 'moral', 'message', 'render', 'meaningful', 'have', 'entertain', 'biggest', 'bombast', 'can', 'throw', 'screen', 'think', 'not', 'idea', 'great', 'filmmaking', 'answer', 'questions', 'yes', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'missing', 'big', 'picture.To', 'start', 'Place', 'Promised', 'Early', 'Days', 'not', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'Rather', 'simple', 'story', 'sci-fi', 'elements', 'Yes', 'parallel', 'universes', 'plot', 'device', 'sort', 'nowhere', 'feeling', 'bit', 'tacked', 'give', 'validity', 'events', 'happen', 'later', 'end', 'what', 'movie', 'trying', 'say', 'greatest', 'promise', 'friends', 'can', 'give', 'promise', 'will', 'never', 'stop', 'story', 'not', 'flaws', 'movie', 'end', 'What', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'real', 'enemy', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pinpoint', 'say', 'Ah', 'ha', 'see', 'bad', 'guy', ""n't"", 'one', 'real', 'antagonist', 'loss', 'innocence', 'what', 'people', 'have', 'do', 'reconnect', 'simplicity', 'was', 'once', 'childhood', 'So', 'when', 'people', 'say', ""n't"", 'action', 'film', 'think', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'looking', 'what', 'film', 'really', 'trying', 'convey.But', 'little', 'action', 'here', 'still', 'pretty', 'look', 'at.The', 'animation', 'here', 'top-notch', 'back', 'Shinkai', 'first', 'work', 'Voices', 'much', 'grander', 'scale', 'Everything', 'bright', 'colorful', 'being', 'saturated', 'hyper-vibrancy', 'well', 'intimacy', 'characters', 'have', 'other.The', 'music', 'just', 'rich', 'palette', 'solo', 'violin', 'piece', 'played', 'film', 'warmth', 'actually', 'colors', 'film', 'hard', 'describe', 'piece', 'own', 'color', 'beautiful', 'animation.Overall', 'movie', 'made', 'realize', 'story', 'as', 'simple', 'one', 'could', 'resonate', 'anyone', 'willing', 'see', 'bigger', 'picture', 'Friendship', 'love', 'dreams', 'childhood', 'transcend', 'difficulties', 'realities', 'life']",The Place Promised in Our Early Days

War hasn't broken out yet, but everyone feels the impending, inevitable start of hostilities, as if war had some life of its own, independent of the humans who fight and die in it. Then, just across the border, the other side has erected a mysterious tower, a needle that pierces the sky.This is the backdrop against which people live their lives and against which children go to school, with that silent, shining tower standing above them all. It's where three friends struggle towards adulthood, and see their struggles crushed under forces they can't control - but maybe ...You'll have to see this for yourself. Science fiction elements contribute to this movie, but only as background.
