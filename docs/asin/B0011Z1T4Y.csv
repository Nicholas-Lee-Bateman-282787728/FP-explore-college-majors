I decided to buy the coffee prince for her, and watched, and was really entertained by the story and the chemistry between the male and female lead.  I liked the music as well.  The supporting couple added some serious tension, and actually came off as a realistic couple/breakup/etc. I thought the ending was a bit rushed, but still felt glad i watched it.  Get this version if you're going to watch this, i wound up buying this one after buying a cheap one on eBay.  The subtitles on the eBay were way off, and the discs would skip/freeze.

While at work, I couldn't wait to rush home and continue watching this DVD set of the South Korean mini-series COFFEE PRINCE (aka 1st SHOP OF COFFEE PRINCE).Aside from a couple rather crude visual jokes, this is a delightful romp -- at least whenever the young-woman-mistaken-for-a-young-man is on screen. The actress's name is Yun Eun Hye (pronounced approximately: yoon oon hay). This cutie carries the show the way that Sandra Bullock carried WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING. She's the reason I'm giving this product 5 stars instead of 4. You might say she stole my heart.Eun Hye was so good that it took me a while to appreciate the contribution of the amiable lead actor Gong Yoo, and others. And to realize how individual the other characters are. Their intricate interactions give the show a unique texture.About half way thru the series, I looked up the actors on the internet and was stunned to learn that I was already familiar with Eun Hye. She sang as part of a Korean girl group called BABY VOX which disbanded around 2005. There were prettier girls in the group, but she's the only one I can still picture in my head. Yet I didn't reconcile the two faces until that moment.This role might have made her a big star in Korea but an earlier TV series already did that, GOONG (aka PALACE, aka PRINCESS HOURS).

It also has a unique musical sense which sets it further apart from the pack. I just wanted to once again comment on official North American MBC DVD releases. This packaging on this box set must have been a labor of love from a fan of the show. Just opening it up and unfolding it's doors brings images of the show rushing in. Nice quality. The video, however, as is typical with MBC North American releases is lacking. While at first glance the picture looks bright and sharp, you'll soon notice over-sharpening in some areas. Even more distressing is when the video quality takes a nose dive when busy patterns or fast motion arrive. That's when you see very heavy compression (a sort of image noise). I suspect that for some reason they compressed it first, and then sharpened it which just accentuates the noise. Very distracting. And very disappointing. However it's quite watchable if you just get over it; you don't see it all of the time.

My favourite series of all time is Boys over Flowers, all versions.  And this version had some fantastic things about it.  But on a personal level, I could not stand the lead actress.  I realize that the Koreans and to a lesser extent the Japanese have a thing about boyish girls.  I have lost count of how many series I have seen where the lead actress is pretending to be a boy.  Amongst that lot, I guess I like You're Beautiful the best.  But it was carried to extremes in this one.I kept waiting for her to longingly put on a dress and feel comfortable, but alas, she wore exactly three dresses in the entire series and walked  like a male athlete in drag when she did.  Seriously, no it was worse.  The way she fell off her shoes, etc, I doubt that there is a male athlete in the world who could not have worn female clothing ten times more convincingly.  Seriosly by the mid point of the series I was just screaming ""get a sex change!"" at her.The Koreans like their girls to act more male than males, apparently.  The males run about with nail polish and their hair lacquered, in 6 cm heels and wear boat collars and cinched waisted jackets, whilst the girls all eat like football players, stuffing  massive  spoons in  their moths until their cheeks almost explode.  The males are constantly sighing ""oh she's so strong!""I have to wonder what is going on over in Korea.  I know it sounds like I don't like these dramas, but in fact I do.  They are deeply romantic and the men are adorable.  I just have a lot of trouble relating to other females who eat like truck drivers, and resist any and every opportunity to do even the slightest feminine thing.This series was excellent apart from that.  But the main character took all the worst characteristics of the female heroines in K-drama and maxed them all out until I lost the ability to relate.  I kept asking myself ""why exactly are  all these men in love with her?""  In one scene, her love interest/boss serves her pizza.  She folds like 5 slices of pizza together and makes a sandwich out of it.  I guess all the guys were thinking that was cute, but I almost lost my lunch.She did cry a lot because her boss didn't respond to her but I had a hard time believing this character actually LIKED men.",3,Not KDrama at its finest,1326153600,"01 10, 2012",2012,2323,"['Let', 'say', 'first', 'absolutely', 'love', 'J-drama', 'K-drama', 'My', 'favourite', 'series', 'time', 'Boys', 'Flowers', 'versions', 'version', 'had', 'fantastic', 'things', 'personal', 'level', 'could', 'not', 'stand', 'lead', 'actress', 'realize', 'Koreans', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Japanese', 'have', 'thing', 'boyish', 'girls', 'have', 'lost', 'count', 'how', 'many', 'series', 'have', 'seen', 'where', 'lead', 'actress', 'pretending', 'be', 'boy', 'Amongst', 'lot', 'guess', ""'re"", 'Beautiful', 'best', 'was', 'carried', 'extremes', 'one.I', 'kept', 'waiting', 'longingly', 'put', 'dress', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'alas', 'wore', 'exactly', 'three', 'dresses', 'entire', 'series', 'walked', 'male', 'athlete', 'drag', 'when', 'did', 'Seriously', 'was', 'worse', 'way', 'fell', 'off', 'shoes', 'etc', 'doubt', 'male', 'athlete', 'world', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'worn', 'female', 'clothing', 'ten', 'times', 'more', 'convincingly', 'Seriosly', 'mid', 'point', 'series', 'was', 'just', 'screaming', 'get', 'sex', 'change', 'her.The', 'Koreans', 'girls', 'act', 'more', 'male', 'males', 'apparently', 'males', 'run', 'nail', 'polish', 'hair', 'lacquered', '6', 'cm', 'heels', 'wear', 'boat', 'collars', 'cinched', 'waisted', 'jackets', 'whilst', 'girls', 'eat', 'football', 'players', 'stuffing', 'massive', 'spoons', 'moths', 'cheeks', 'almost', 'explode', 'males', 'are', 'constantly', 'sighing', 'so', 'strong', 'have', 'wonder', 'what', 'going', 'Korea', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'dramas', 'fact', 'do', 'are', 'deeply', 'romantic', 'men', 'are', 'adorable', 'just', 'have', 'lot', 'trouble', 'relating', 'other', 'females', 'who', 'eat', 'truck', 'drivers', 'resist', 'opportunity', 'do', 'even', 'slightest', 'feminine', 'thing.This', 'series', 'was', 'excellent', 'apart', 'main', 'character', 'took', 'worst', 'characteristics', 'female', 'heroines', 'K-drama', 'maxed', 'lost', 'ability', 'relate', 'kept', 'asking', 'why', 'exactly', 'are', 'men', 'love', 'one', 'scene', 'love', 'interest/boss', 'pizza', '5', 'slices', 'pizza', 'together', 'sandwich', 'guess', 'guys', 'were', 'thinking', 'was', 'cute', 'almost', 'lost', 'lunch.She', 'did', 'cry', 'lot', 'boss', 'did', ""n't"", 'respond', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'character', 'actually', 'LIKED', 'men']",N/A

Just having finished the final episode of Coffee Prince, I have to rate it as one of my favorites. I consumed the entire series in four days and can't remember when I felt happier about 17 hours of viewing.It doesn't matter if you've never watched a Korean drama before; if you enjoy a good love story with all the ups and downs, this one will keep you engrossed. Everything from the production quality, to the acting, to the soundtrack is on par with the best Hollywood has ever given us. The characters grow and develop throughout the story, there's plenty of movement in every episode, and the ending (while some reviewers felt it seemed rushed) was satisfying and worked well. Knowing there was a happily-ever-after was good enough that I didn't need to see it play out on screen.The songs and musical tracks provided a beautiful backdrop and if you're even the least bit sentimental, you'll find yourself smiling and crying as the story moves along. I can't say enough good things about this series. It won my heart and I'm sure to watch it over and over again.",5,A Good Romantic Comedy in Any Language,1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,1206,"[""'ve"", 'watched', 'many', 'dozens', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'years', 'everything', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'classics', 'latest', 'theatrical', 'releases', 'Just', 'having', 'finished', 'final', 'episode', 'Coffee', 'Prince', 'have', 'rate', 'one', 'favorites', 'consumed', 'entire', 'series', 'four', 'days', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'when', 'felt', 'happier', '17', 'hours', 'viewing.It', ""n't"", 'matter', ""'ve"", 'never', 'watched', 'Korean', 'drama', 'enjoy', 'good', 'love', 'story', 'ups', 'downs', 'one', 'will', 'keep', 'engrossed', 'Everything', 'production', 'quality', 'acting', 'soundtrack', 'par', 'best', 'Hollywood', 'ever', 'given', 'characters', 'grow', 'develop', 'story', 'plenty', 'movement', 'episode', 'ending', 'reviewers', 'felt', 'seemed', 'rushed', 'was', 'satisfying', 'worked', 'well', 'Knowing', 'was', 'happily-ever-after', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'play', 'out', 'screen.The', 'songs', 'musical', 'tracks', 'provided', 'beautiful', 'backdrop', ""'re"", 'even', 'least', 'bit', 'sentimental', ""'ll"", 'find', 'smiling', 'crying', 'story', 'moves', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'series', 'won', 'heart', ""'m"", 'sure', 'watch', 'over', 'again']",N/A
