I, too, was able to guess who was the killer but still enjoyed it overall and especially Brian Dennehy's performance.As to the issue raised by another poster regarding closed captions, my DVD is not closed-captioned and ""CC"" is not indicated on the case description.  Amazon does describe it as ""closed-captioned"" and when I submitted a Catalog Update Form to correct this, my suggestion was denied.",3,Closed Captions?,1366329600,"04 19, 2013",2013,425,"['movie', 'was', 'OK', 'too', 'was', 'able', 'guess', 'who', 'was', 'killer', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'overall', 'especially', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'performance.As', 'issue', 'raised', 'poster', 'regarding', 'closed', 'captions', 'DVD', 'not', 'closed-captioned', 'CC', 'not', 'indicated', 'case', 'description', 'Amazon', 'describe', 'closed-captioned', 'when', 'submitted', 'Catalog', 'Update', 'Form', 'correct', 'suggestion', 'was', 'denied']",Steve Martini's Undue Influence

926953,ANOBZWKE25SBY,B000AGTQ18,Tracy Vest,"[4, 5]","A recent widower defends his sister in law who is accused of murdering her ex-husband's trophy wife after a bitter custody dispute. Dennehy is always believable as the hapless lawyer and Patricia Richardson (Home Improvement) portrays the sister in law who doesn't put up much of a defense much to his frustration.I love character actor Dennehy, who always injects an ""everyman"" vibe to all of his characters. Unfortunately, at a little under three hours, there were lots of twists and turn, but this was too long and too predicatable. I guessed the ""twist"" within in the first half hour, so it was a big letdown.  The Madriani character lives on, but not with Dennehy - he is protrayed by Mr. Big himself, Chris Noth in a sequel from 2001.",3,Completely predictable,1253577600,"09 22, 2009",2009,740,"['recent', 'widower', 'sister', 'law', 'who', 'accused', 'murdering', 'ex-husband', 'trophy', 'wife', 'bitter', 'custody', 'dispute', 'Dennehy', 'always', 'believable', 'hapless', 'lawyer', 'Patricia', 'Richardson', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'sister', 'law', 'who', ""n't"", 'put', 'up', 'much', 'defense', 'much', 'frustration.I', 'love', 'character', 'actor', 'Dennehy', 'who', 'always', 'everyman', 'vibe', 'characters', 'Unfortunately', 'little', 'three', 'hours', 'were', 'lots', 'twists', 'turn', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'predicatable', 'guessed', 'twist', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'was', 'big', 'letdown', 'Madriani', 'character', 'lives', 'not', 'Dennehy', 'protrayed', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'sequel', '2001']",Steve Martini's Undue Influence
