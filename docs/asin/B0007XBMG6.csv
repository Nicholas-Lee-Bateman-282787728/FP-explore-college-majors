The plot was fantastic and the cast was phenomenal. Tim Curry was exceptional as usual as Dameon. Im not gonna even try to describe the movie becuse it would not do justice to the movie. Deffinatly a must see.,5,mind blowing and brilliant,1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,348,"['mainly', 'bought', 'movie', 'starred', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'i', 'dont', 'understand', 'why', 'name', 'isnt', 'first', 'cast', 'listing', 'anyways', 'plot', 'was', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'was', 'exceptional', 'as', 'usual', 'Dameon', 'Im', 'not', 'gon', 'even', 'try', 'describe', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'movie', 'Deffinatly', 'must', 'see']",Sorted

Frankly, I was surprised that it took over 5-years for this indie gem to find U.S. distribution, and my hat's off to Ardustry for making the commitment.  This is not an ""easy"" film per se, as the issues of Rave-Scene drug use, promiscuous sexual activities of super-model types and a murder-mystery-plot to drive the action are not ""PG"" material.  But the aluring performances by Fay Masterson opposite Matthew Rhys show promise of big things to come for both young actors, and set ""SORTED"" apart from typical indie-film fare.

893516,A342EHO42V2G38,B0007XBMG6,"Terran ""Terran""","[3, 3]","Unfortunately the region 1 dvd is missing the load of extras contained on the U.K. region 2 release.The first part of the film, we meet ""Carl,"" who has come to London to sort out his brother's belongings and also look into the death of his brother, who'd taken a drug-addled dive off a skyscraper during the night of a rave.  He quickly meets his brother's girlfriend, and the two are instantly attracted to each other, as they unofficially date by having the excuse of bonding together in order to solve the mysteries of the departed ""Justin's"" life.  In more than one way, Carl is intent on sorting out his brother's effects.  What happens along the way is the suited well-coiffed Carl is liberated, at least for the time being, the excuse his willing seduction into the strobe-lit, drug and danced fueled world his brother frequented.  He takes rather easily into this new lifestyle, enjoying his brother's expensive set of wheels and apartment, and is soon placated that his brother's death was an accident after all:  He simply has new sensations and people on his mind now, and you can start worrying that he too might suffer a miserable end.A highlight is the actor playing the cross-dressing ""Michael"" - who takes to Carl, and one can read attraction into it, as well as a certain fondness and also protectiveness, but nothing overt.  The leading ladies are vying for Carl's affection as well, but are there ulterior motives in this?  This is the kind of film where you can't take for granted what's at face value - or can you?The standout is lead Matthew Rhys, in yet another accent by this Welshman, who is finally gaining some long overdue recognition in the States due to his co-starring role in the ABC series BROTHERS AND SISTERS.  His typical acting style is understated, yet he is always in the moment and you can see every thought in his head.  Also, he is certainly a stunning-looking man (he would have been mid-twenties at the time of filming) as he's obviously well-suited for color as opposed to black and white with those crisp blue eyes and red full lips and pale skin with dark hair.  Regardless of the leading ladies, he is the best-looking thing on the screen and your eyes naturally find him even in crowded club scenes.Tim Curry as the villain is very typical here, nothing special either way in his performance - perhaps he is reserved as opposed to being over-the-top. As for the character's personal life, it wasn't fleshed-out adequately and I hadn't a clue what to make of him; surprisingly one or two dimensional, at best.The second half of the film, unfortunately sacrifices some of the character development from the first half in order to propel the plot forward.  There are a few surprises in store for Carl and we are right there as he is finding things out and dealing with them.  One thing you can say for Carl, this thinking young man adapts to situations quickly and responds in the only intelligent way each time.  One has the idea his self-sacrificing nature - staying home with the parents and maintaining a career there, and foresaking the lights of London which lured his brother away - means he is forced to put others' needs ahead of his own, and maybe the situation just got more complicated, but he's still there to handle things.The ending is unsatisfactory, as you're provided snippets when you've actually come to care about these characters and would like to spend more time with them.",4,Uneven Focus,1185148800,"07 23, 2007",2007,3442,"['Unfortunately', 'region', '1', 'dvd', 'missing', 'load', 'extras', 'contained', 'U.K.', 'region', '2', 'release.The', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'meet', 'Carl', 'who', 'come', 'London', 'sort', 'out', 'brother', 'belongings', 'also', 'look', 'death', 'brother', 'who', ""'d"", 'taken', 'drug-addled', 'dive', 'skyscraper', 'night', 'rave', 'quickly', 'brother', 'girlfriend', 'two', 'are', 'instantly', 'attracted', 'other', 'unofficially', 'date', 'having', 'excuse', 'bonding', 'together', 'order', 'solve', 'mysteries', 'departed', 'Justin', 'life', 'more', 'one', 'way', 'Carl', 'intent', 'sorting', 'out', 'brother', 'effects', 'What', 'way', 'suited', 'well-coiffed', 'Carl', 'liberated', 'least', 'time', 'being', 'excuse', 'willing', 'seduction', 'strobe-lit', 'drug', 'danced', 'fueled', 'world', 'brother', 'frequented', 'rather', 'easily', 'new', 'lifestyle', 'enjoying', 'brother', 'expensive', 'set', 'wheels', 'apartment', 'soon', 'placated', 'brother', 'death', 'was', 'accident', 'simply', 'new', 'sensations', 'people', 'mind', 'now', 'can', 'start', 'worrying', 'too', 'might', 'suffer', 'miserable', 'end.A', 'highlight', 'actor', 'playing', 'cross-dressing', 'Michael', 'who', 'Carl', 'one', 'can', 'read', 'attraction', 'as', 'well', 'certain', 'fondness', 'also', 'protectiveness', 'nothing', 'overt', 'leading', 'ladies', 'are', 'vying', 'Carl', 'affection', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'there', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'kind', 'film', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'granted', 'what', 'face', 'value', 'can', 'standout', 'lead', 'Matthew', 'Rhys', 'yet', 'accent', 'Welshman', 'who', 'finally', 'gaining', 'long', 'overdue', 'recognition', 'States', 'due', 'co-starring', 'role', 'ABC', 'series', 'BROTHERS', 'AND', 'SISTERS', 'typical', 'acting', 'style', 'understated', 'yet', 'always', 'moment', 'can', 'see', 'thought', 'head', 'Also', 'certainly', 'stunning-looking', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'mid-twenties', 'time', 'filming', 'obviously', 'well-suited', 'color', 'opposed', 'black', 'white', 'crisp', 'blue', 'eyes', 'red', 'full', 'lips', 'pale', 'skin', 'dark', 'hair', 'Regardless', 'leading', 'ladies', 'best-looking', 'thing', 'screen', 'eyes', 'naturally', 'find', 'even', 'crowded', 'club', 'scenes.Tim', 'Curry', 'villain', 'very', 'typical', 'here', 'nothing', 'special', 'way', 'performance', 'perhaps', 'reserved', 'opposed', 'being', 'over-the-top', 'character', 'personal', 'life', 'was', ""n't"", 'fleshed-out', 'adequately', 'had', ""n't"", 'clue', 'what', 'make', 'surprisingly', 'one', 'two', 'dimensional', 'best.The', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'character', 'development', 'first', 'half', 'order', 'propel', 'plot', 'forward', 'are', 'few', 'surprises', 'store', 'Carl', 'are', 'right', 'there', 'finding', 'things', 'out', 'dealing', 'One', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'Carl', 'thinking', 'young', 'man', 'situations', 'quickly', 'only', 'intelligent', 'way', 'time', 'One', 'idea', 'self-sacrificing', 'nature', 'staying', 'home', 'parents', 'maintaining', 'career', 'there', 'foresaking', 'lights', 'London', 'lured', 'brother', 'away', 'forced', 'put', 'others', 'needs', 'ahead', 'own', 'maybe', 'situation', 'just', 'got', 'more', 'complicated', 'still', 'there', 'handle', 'things.The', 'ending', 'unsatisfactory', ""'re"", 'provided', 'snippets', 'when', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'come', 'care', 'characters', 'would', 'like', 'spend', 'more', 'time']",Sorted
