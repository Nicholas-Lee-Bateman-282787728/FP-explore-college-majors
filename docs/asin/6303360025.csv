370533,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,6303360025,Bomojaz,"[3, 3]","Victor McLaglen, one-time Heavyweight Champion of Great Britain, won an Oscar for his portrayal of Gypo Nolan, a drunken lug of an Irishman during the Dublin uprisings in 1922, who rats out his best friend for a 20-pound reward. McLaglen is perfect in this role; director John Ford, who also won an Oscar, was not looking for subtlety from McLaglen and didn't get an ounce of it: he takes the camera on as if it was one of his old boxing opponents. Perhaps there was no more powerful a dumb-brute screen performance until Brando's Stanley Kowalski. Legend has it that Ford kept McLaglen soused for most of the picture (it was made in only 17 days), and it looks like it might be true. The photography is stunning and captures perfectly the ""as wet as drip"" look of Dublin. Max Steiner's musical score is also very moving.

370534,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,6303360025,Char,"[1, 1]","Dublin, 1922.  The IRA is pitted against the Blacks and Tans.  The fate of the Irish nation is at stake.  Even a ""good"" man with a ""heart"" argues that this is ""No time for sentiment.  This is War!""What is one man's life worth, if he's ""guilty""?  What about the idea of taking one man's life for the sake of ""many""?A court of Judgment versus a lover's plea for Mercy.  What about the guilty man's excuse that he ""didn't know what he was doing""?  How much Forgiveness is that worth?At first, the story seems to hold merely a passing resemblance to one element of the Passion of Christ, Judas' betrayal, but, by the time the movie is ending, the viewer, depending upon his or her background, may realize that various essential concepts that derive out of the life and Passion of Christ are intermingled in the denouement.And, the viewer is likely to be aware, too, that the character named Mary stands more than coincidentally for certain qualities, as does her mother, these two who constitute the family of the first murdered man in the story--who is CLEARLY a victim.  --At first, the informer's guilt and expedient punishment seem like a ""cut and dried"" case...This is a psychological drama that focuses upon a man trapped in a ""groping primitive mind.""  I've lifted that phrase and put quotes around it as offering a descriptive insight that comes from a quite brief but illuminating tutorial accompanying the 2006 reissue of this film.  Also from the commentary, we learn that the dark and often foggy atmosphere of the sets were John Ford's way of portraying the circumstances of the protagonist's personality.  The man acts within a ""fog.""  Likewise, the movie sets continually enforce a sense of his entrapment, not only in his limited self, but in his circumstances.  One of the chief motivating images out of which the plot grows illustrates how the starving Gypo Nolan and the woman he loves, Katy, dream of ""escape"" to America, an ultimately futile dream.While this drawn-out story proves finally to be a significant and important drama, the viewing of it requires some patient endurance while the viewer must accompany the none-too-attractive character of Gypo through some not-very-interesting experiences which will prove meaningful, nonetheless, within the context of the entire story.  In the latter half, or perhaps as far as the last third of the 92-minute film, from the ""court"" scene onward, the story begins to become exciting and to sparkle with meaningfulness.  Then you feel glad you went through it all to get to the unexpected, uplifting finale.The sound track is a trial to be endured.  In order to hear the dialogue, you have to turn the sound way up, but, then, when the music and noise of tumult occur, they are VERY loud and you have to hurry and turn the sound way down.  I didn't care for the music as such.There were some nice touches of humor, such as the talkative personality of Mullins, the tailor, and the various personalities at the speak-easy and around the town.  (They reminded me of Dickens' characters.)The brief tutorial with this movie serves as a really beneficial Plus that helps to open the viewers eyes to deeper meaning as conveyed in the film techniques that John Ford used so creatively, symbolically.I keep wondering how Ford managed to convey a certain ineffable sense of peace and love, and a certain quality of spiritual depth and quietness (and what else?) several times when the camera focused on the character named Mary.  Part of the effect came from the modest little cross nestled at the center of the modest lace collar, but there was some sort of acting  ""magic"" going on behind those visual items, too, wasn't there?  Or did I imagine it?  And, if I did imagine it, why did I imagine it?The character of Katy, who has turned prostitute out of need, proves to be a sympathetic one.  All three women's roles, centering upon the quality of mercy, and the roles of Mary and Katy centering in the concept of giving all for love [which is romantic love for their husbands-to-be], bear thinking upon.  It's interesting that in the very first view of Katy, she is wearing a shawl that covers her head and her prostitute-clothes, and she remarkably resembles a saintly ""Virgin Mary"" type.  Later, she proves to have true, innocent, sincere love for Gypo, so she is revealed to be a ""virtuous"" woman underneath her prostitute appearance.  As with the character of Gypo, we see a mixture of contradictory elements in their characters, and the influence of circumstances of poverty.The movie received the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1935.  I find it a meaningful, worthwhile work.",4,Of what worth is the life of ANY man?,1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,4641,"['Dublin', '1922', 'IRA', 'pitted', 'Blacks', 'Tans', 'fate', 'Irish', 'nation', 'stake', 'Even', 'good', 'man', 'heart', 'No', 'time', 'sentiment', 'War', 'What', 'one', 'man', 'life', 'worth', 'guilty', 'What', 'idea', 'taking', 'one', 'man', 'life', 'sake', 'many', 'court', 'Judgment', 'versus', 'lover', 'plea', 'Mercy', 'What', 'guilty', 'man', 'excuse', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'How', 'much', 'Forgiveness', 'worth', 'first', 'story', 'hold', 'merely', 'passing', 'resemblance', 'one', 'element', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'Judas', 'betrayal', 'time', 'movie', 'ending', 'viewer', 'depending', 'background', 'may', 'realize', 'various', 'essential', 'concepts', 'derive', 'life', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'are', 'intermingled', 'denouement.And', 'viewer', 'likely', 'be', 'aware', 'too', 'character', 'named', 'Mary', 'more', 'coincidentally', 'certain', 'qualities', 'mother', 'two', 'who', 'constitute', 'family', 'first', 'murdered', 'man', 'story', 'who', 'CLEARLY', 'victim', 'first', 'informer', 'guilt', 'expedient', 'punishment', 'seem', 'cut', 'dried', 'case', 'psychological', 'drama', 'man', 'trapped', 'groping', 'primitive', 'mind', ""'ve"", 'lifted', 'phrase', 'put', 'quotes', 'offering', 'descriptive', 'insight', 'quite', 'brief', 'illuminating', 'tutorial', 'accompanying', '2006', 'reissue', 'film', 'Also', 'commentary', 'learn', 'dark', 'often', 'foggy', 'atmosphere', 'sets', 'were', 'John', 'Ford', 'way', 'portraying', 'circumstances', 'protagonist', 'personality', 'man', 'fog', 'Likewise', 'movie', 'continually', 'enforce', 'sense', 'entrapment', 'not', 'only', 'limited', 'self', 'circumstances', 'One', 'chief', 'motivating', 'images', 'plot', 'how', 'starving', 'Gypo', 'Nolan', 'woman', 'Katy', 'dream', 'escape', 'America', 'ultimately', 'futile', 'dream.While', 'drawn-out', 'story', 'finally', 'be', 'significant', 'important', 'drama', 'viewing', 'patient', 'endurance', 'viewer', 'must', 'accompany', 'none-too-attractive', 'character', 'Gypo', 'not-very-interesting', 'experiences', 'will', 'prove', 'meaningful', 'nonetheless', 'context', 'entire', 'story', 'latter', 'half', 'perhaps', 'as', 'far', 'last', 'third', '92-minute', 'film', 'court', 'scene', 'onward', 'story', 'become', 'exciting', 'sparkle', 'meaningfulness', 'Then', 'feel', 'glad', 'went', 'get', 'unexpected', 'uplifting', 'finale.The', 'sound', 'track', 'trial', 'be', 'endured', 'order', 'hear', 'dialogue', 'have', 'turn', 'sound', 'way', 'then', 'when', 'music', 'noise', 'tumult', 'occur', 'are', 'VERY', 'loud', 'have', 'hurry', 'turn', 'sound', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'music', 'such.There', 'were', 'nice', 'touches', 'humor', 'such', 'talkative', 'personality', 'Mullins', 'tailor', 'various', 'personalities', 'speak-easy', 'town', 'reminded', 'Dickens', 'characters', 'brief', 'tutorial', 'movie', 'really', 'beneficial', 'open', 'viewers', 'eyes', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'conveyed', 'film', 'techniques', 'John', 'Ford', 'used', 'so', 'creatively', 'symbolically.I', 'keep', 'wondering', 'how', 'Ford', 'managed', 'convey', 'certain', 'ineffable', 'sense', 'peace', 'love', 'certain', 'quality', 'spiritual', 'depth', 'quietness', 'what', 'else', 'several', 'times', 'when', 'camera', 'focused', 'character', 'named', 'Mary', 'Part', 'effect', 'came', 'modest', 'little', 'cross', 'nestled', 'center', 'modest', 'lace', 'collar', 'was', 'sort', 'acting', 'magic', 'going', 'visual', 'items', 'too', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'did', 'imagine', 'did', 'imagine', 'why', 'did', 'imagine', 'character', 'Katy', 'who', 'turned', 'prostitute', 'need', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'one', 'three', 'women', 'roles', 'centering', 'quality', 'mercy', 'roles', 'Mary', 'Katy', 'centering', 'concept', 'giving', 'love', '[', 'romantic', 'love', 'husbands-to-be', ']', 'thinking', 'upon', 'interesting', 'very', 'first', 'view', 'Katy', 'wearing', 'shawl', 'head', 'prostitute-clothes', 'remarkably', 'saintly', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'type', 'Later', 'have', 'true', 'innocent', 'sincere', 'love', 'Gypo', 'revealed', 'be', 'virtuous', 'woman', 'prostitute', 'appearance', 'character', 'Gypo', 'see', 'mixture', 'contradictory', 'elements', 'characters', 'influence', 'circumstances', 'poverty.The', 'movie', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Picture', '1935', 'find', 'meaningful', 'worthwhile', 'work']",The Informer VHS
370535,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6303360025,David Baldwin,"[28, 28]","Years before ""Citizen Kane"" John Ford revolutionized the language of American cinema with ""The Informer"".  Atmosphere plays as much a character here as the actors themselves.  Shadows, darkness, and fog forbode the doom of Gyppo Nolan(Victor McLaglen) as much as his guilty conscience for informing to the Black and Tans on his former brother in arms.  This is a literate film that explores the psyche of a barely literate man.  Gyppo ostensibly informs on Frankie McPhillip (Wallace Ford) to gain passage to America for himself and his streetwalker girlfriend(Heather Angel).  The bloodmoney proves too much of a cross to bear so he literally gives it away to ease his burning guilt.  This proves his undoing as the scent of his illgotten gains attracts the Republican Army to his trail of deceit.  McLaglen won an Oscar for one of great performances in American screen history.  McLaglen assays all the complexities of a seeming simpleton who commits the unthinkable and makes him sympathetic and ultimately worthy of redemption.  ""The Informer"" is ultimately a film that will transcend the ages because it's themes are as universal today as they were in 1935.",5,Landmark of Cinema,1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,1162,"['Years', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'John', 'Ford', 'revolutionized', 'language', 'American', 'cinema', 'Informer', 'Atmosphere', 'as', 'much', 'character', 'here', 'actors', 'Shadows', 'darkness', 'fog', 'forbode', 'doom', 'Gyppo', 'Nolan', 'Victor', 'McLaglen', 'as', 'much', 'guilty', 'conscience', 'informing', 'Black', 'Tans', 'former', 'brother', 'arms', 'literate', 'film', 'psyche', 'barely', 'literate', 'man', 'Gyppo', 'ostensibly', 'Frankie', 'McPhillip', 'Wallace', 'Ford', 'gain', 'passage', 'America', 'streetwalker', 'girlfriend', 'Heather', 'Angel', 'bloodmoney', 'too', 'much', 'cross', 'bear', 'so', 'literally', 'away', 'ease', 'burning', 'guilt', 'undoing', 'scent', 'illgotten', 'gains', 'Republican', 'Army', 'trail', 'deceit', 'McLaglen', 'won', 'Oscar', 'one', 'great', 'performances', 'American', 'screen', 'history', 'McLaglen', 'complexities', 'seeming', 'simpleton', 'who', 'unthinkable', 'sympathetic', 'ultimately', 'worthy', 'redemption', 'Informer', 'ultimately', 'film', 'will', 'transcend', 'ages', 'themes', 'are', 'universal', 'today', 'were', '1935']",The Informer VHS
370536,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6303360025,Dr. James Gardner,"[3, 3]","Personally I think Victor McLaglen's (1886-1959) best performance was in ""The Quiet Man"" (1952) although I enjoyed him even more in ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1949). Both these films were directed by John Ford (1894-1973) and in both of them McLaglen played supporting roles to John Wayne. While he was nominated for an Academy Award for ""The Quiet Man"", he won it for his portrayal of Gypo Nolan in ""The Informer"". And in 1935 he was competing with Clark Gable and Charles Laughten (""Mutiny on the Bounty"").FWIW - Initially there was reluctance at RKO to cast McLaglen, but Ford fought for his old friend. Then, after he won the Oscar, Ford was reluctant to join in the chorus of praise. He told an inter viewer in 1936 ""I'm no McLaglen fan, you know.""John Ford also won the Academy Award that year for ""The Informer,"" the first of his 4 awards for best director (he won his last one with McLaglen and Wayne in ""The Quiet Man""). He worked often with McLaglen, in silent films and in talkies. Prior to ""The Informer"" their most famous teaming was ""The Lost Patrol"" (1934). Interestingly enough, both ""The Lost Patrol"" and ""The Informer"" were remakes of silent films shot in the 20s.Coming in 1935, this film has many overtones left over from the silent film era, an era in which Ford made some 60 films, the last of which he made with McLaglen (""Four Sons""). There are some really memorable scenes (e.g., when McLaglen looks in the window of the Travel agency and realizes he's spent the money he needed; when his girlfriend Margot Grahame solicits a customer on the street) which have no dialogue and in which the actors do wonders, just as the best silent films had done.This film has many characters you've seen so often. Wallace Ford (1898-1966) plays Frankie McPhillip, the man McLaglen betrays - Ford appeared in nearly 200 films between 1930 and 1965. Preston Foster (1900-70) is Dan Gallagher, the head of the local IRA - Foster appeared in over 100 films, and is best known for playing the Northwest Mounted Police. Other notables include John's older brother Francis Ford (1881-1953) and Donald Meek (1878-1946). Special mention must be made of Una O'Connor (1880-1959) who plays Frankie's mother. She was a terrific actress who made nearly 100 films between 1929 and 1957. She was a true scene stealer and did so in films such as ""The Invisible Man"" (1933), ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935), and ""The Adventure of Robin Hood"" (1938).Ford's use of photography is at its best here, showing influences from the German Expressionists, especially Fritz Lang's ""M"", but there is none of the careful staging that became a hallmark of his later films. McLaglen, on the other hand, appears fully formed. All the drinking, cursing, fighting, and bluster that would become his characteristics are on stage here, partly because he was nearly 50 when the film was made.Long time Ford collaborator Dudley Nichols (1895-1960) wrote the screenplay. Nichols has the distinction of being the first person to refuse an Oscar, for his work on this film. He would be nominated 3 more times (""The long Voyage Home"", ""Air Force"", ""The Tin Star"") but never won again. Among his notable films were ""The 3 Musketeers"" (1935), ""Stagecoach"" (1939), ""Gunga Din"" (1939), and ""Pinky"" (1949).Austrian composer Max Steiner handled the musical score, which is heavy handed and tied to the symbolism, but nonetheless impressive.  Between 1935 and 1956 he was nominated for an Oscar 19 times, and won for ""Since You Went Away"" (1944), ""Now Voyager"" (1942), and this film. He was so well known that he appeared on a 33 cent stamp (1999) along with Dimitri Tiomkin and Alfred Newman.Winning two major Academy Awards in 1935 was an incredible achievement for the film. Tired of the depression, the major films were comedies and musicals (the Marx Brothers' ""Night at the Opera"", Fred Astaire's ""Top Hat"", Frank Capra's ""Mr Deeds"", Nelson Eddy and Jeanette McDonald's ""Rose Marie"") so the idea of a starving man betraying his best friend to buy a ticket to the US for himself and his street walking girlfriend was hardly the type of escapism that was most popular.Ford was originally turned down by all the major studios, but help from his friend Joseph P. Kennedy, another Irishman, got him the green light at RKO where he had already made the successful ""The Lost Patrol"" the previous year, starring McLaglen. Ford also got help from  Merian Cooper (1893-1973) who was the Head of Production. Cooper was nominated for an Oscar for ""The Quiet Man"" (1952), one of several films he made with John Wayne (e.g., ""The Searchers"", ""Rio Grande"", ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"", ""Fort Apache""). His other notable films include ""King Kong"" (1933) and ""Wagon Master"" (1950). Ford called Cooper his favorite producer. Among his other talents, Cooper was a pioneer in stop motion animation, Technicolor, and Cinerama as well as a war hero, an aviation pioneer, and one of the first real life documentary makers.Despite the initial doubts, the film was a box office and a critical success. The NY Times called the film ""an astonishing screen drama"" and ""a striking psychological study of a gutter Judas and a rawly impressive picture of the Dublin underworld during the Black and Tan terror."" They heaped high praise on McLaglen saying he ""becomes brilliant under Mr. Ford's guidance"" and praised the supporting cast as ""excellent"".Daryl F. Zanuck called the film ""a visual masterpiece almost unparalleled in cinema history"". Variety said it was ""forcefully and intelligently written, directed, and acted"".This film is worth viewing for fans of John Ford, fans of films of the 30s, especially the German expressionist influence on American films, and for fans of McLaglen.",4,McGlaglen and Ford w/o The Duke = Classic,1263081600,"01 10, 2010",2010,5726,"['Personally', 'think', 'Victor', 'McLaglen', '1886-1959',

370545,A3BSS2M2DPPV4T,6303360025,"""scotsladdie""","[8, 9]","Liam O'Flaherty's 1925 novel is a masterful psychological study of Gypo Nolan, a dull-witted, impovershed Dubliner who, in the middle of the 1922 Sinn Fein Rebellion, turns stool pigeon during one event-filled night, revealing to police the whereabouts of Frankie McPhillip, a trusting friend and revolutionary who's wanted for murder. Gypo receives a reward of twenty pounds, while Franke is is tracked down by the authorities...........THE INFORMER had already been filmed by the British in 1929 and RKO reluctantly agreed to let Ford remake it with his assurance that it would be a low-budget movie. It was made for slightly over $200,000. This is impassioned Irish melodrama, performed with all the stops out. Beautifully photographed in the mists and dark streets of the studio-built Dublin sets, Joseph H. August's photography coats the film with a striking overlay of distorted realism. The most celebrated image of the film is that of its hulking, blustering central figure, as broadly played by oafish Victor McLaglen in his Oscar winning role of Gypo Nolan. McLaglen's Nolan emerges as a cowardly, despicable brute and boozing liar, capable of any deceit to satisfy a whim or save his neck. McLaglen's interpretation of Gypo is astounding; he seemingly sunk in the sodden body and mind and soul of Gypo Nolan, a creature of the slums pushed on his fumbling way by only the most primitive instincts. Yet, without ever noticeably playing for sympathy, he manages to present a figure that is somehow pitiable. J.M. Kerrigan is terrific, not only because he has the only richly authentic brogue in the whole picture, but because of his portrait of a grasping Irish toady that, for sheer brilliance, surpasses even McLaglen's performance. Ford won his first of four AA for his expert direction.  As a footnote, both Ford and McLaglen were said to drink before some of the more emotional scenes.  Ford spent some 5 years trying to get this film made (studio heads found the subject matter too dark).  The screenplay was written in six days.  It wasn't a successful film until the end of the year, when critics named it one of 1935's ten best films; thereafter, audiences flocked to see it, making it a box-office smash.",5,BETRAYAL IN IRELAND,998438400,"08 22, 2001",2001,2223,"['Liam', ""O'Flaherty"", '1925', 'novel', 'masterful', 'psychological', 'study', 'Gypo', 'Nolan', 'dull-witted', 'impovershed', 'Dubliner', 'who', 'middle', '1922', 'Sinn', 'Fein', 'Rebellion', 'stool', 'pigeon', 'one', 'event-filled', 'night', 'revealing', 'police', 'whereabouts', 'Frankie', 'McPhillip', 'trusting', 'friend', 'revolutionary', 'who', 'wanted', 'murder', 'Gypo', 'reward', 'twenty', 'pounds', 'Franke', 'tracked', 'down', 'authorities', '..THE', 'INFORMER', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'filmed', 'British', '1929', 'RKO', 'reluctantly', 'agreed', 'let', 'Ford', 'remake', 'assurance', 'would', 'be', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'slightly', '200,000', 'impassioned', 'Irish', 'melodrama', 'performed', 'stops', 'out', 'Beautifully', 'photographed', 'mists', 'dark', 'streets', 'studio-built', 'Dublin', 'sets', 'Joseph', 'H.', 'August', 'photography', 'film', 'striking', 'overlay', 'distorted', 'realism', 'most', 'celebrated', 'image', 'film', 'hulking', 'blustering', 'central', 'figure', 'broadly', 'played', 'oafish', 'Victor', 'McLaglen', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'role', 'Gypo', 'Nolan', 'McLaglen', 'Nolan', 'cowardly', 'despicable', 'brute', 'boozing', 'liar', 'capable', 'deceit', 'satisfy', 'whim', 'save', 'neck', 'McLaglen', 'interpretation', 'Gypo', 'astounding', 'seemingly', 'sodden', 'body', 'mind', 'soul', 'Gypo', 'Nolan', 'creature', 'slums', 'pushed', 'fumbling', 'way', 'only', 'most', 'primitive', 'instincts', 'ever', 'noticeably', 'playing', 'sympathy', 'present', 'figure', 'somehow', 'pitiable', 'J.M', 'Kerrigan', 'terrific', 'not', 'only', 'only', 'richly', 'authentic', 'brogue', 'whole', 'picture', 'portrait', 'grasping', 'Irish', 'toady', 'sheer', 'brilliance', 'even', 'McLaglen', 'performance', 'Ford', 'won', 'first', 'four', 'AA', 'expert', 'direction', 'footnote', 'Ford', 'McLaglen', 'were', 'said', 'drink', 'more', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'Ford', 'spent', '5', 'years', 'trying', 'get', 'film', 'made', 'studio', 'heads', 'found', 'subject', 'matter', 'too', 'dark', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'six', 'days', 'was', ""n't"", 'successful', 'film', 'end', 'year', 'when', 'critics', 'named', 'one', '1935', 'ten', 'best', 'films', 'thereafter', 'audiences', 'flocked', 'see', 'making', 'box-office', 'smash']",The Informer VHS

But his guilty conscience keeps drawing him back until the intriguing (and somewhat contrived) climax in a Catholic Church.

This is a pre-noir film noir Irish gangster movie in which Victor McLaglen plays an Irishman that sells out his Republican Army buddy to the British police in order to get enough money to leave Ireland and go to America with his girl. But he doesn't use the money to buy steamship tickets - instead, he gets drunk and gives the money away. He's an idiot, and his comrades in arms realize that after tailing him over the course of the night. So, they have a trial and he's found guilty of causing the death of his friend. Typical of Ford is the fantastic character study of McLaglen's character, the action, and the cultural details. I wouldn't have thought I would have enjoyed a film starring McLaglen, but he won an Oscar for this performance, and it is that good. This is one of Ford's earliest and best. In spite of McLaglen's Oscar, it's Ford and the supporting cast that make the film so good.
