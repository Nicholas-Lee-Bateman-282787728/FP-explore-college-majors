821326,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B000226A0K,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","THE ADMIRAL WAS A LADY (1950) is the only film credited as ""presented by Jack M. Warner"" (Jr.).Here, Edmund O'Brien handles a comedic role well. He's leader of a former WWII squad of ne'er-do-wells who expend more energy avoiding employment that it would take to hold a job. As we soon see. they have a number of creative angles for living on the cheap. The gang's routine radically changes when they meet a charming young lady (Wanda Hendrix) just out of the Navy who hopes to reunite with her boyfriend.It's a pleasant story with a predictable finale, but getting to that conclusion is where the fun lies.Rudy Vallee provides the biggest laughs as a jukebox company owner who often suffers back spasms that cause strange gyrations and contortions. Also with Johnny Sands, Steve Brodie, Richard Erdman and Hillary Brooke as Vallee's trouble-making ex-wife.",4,"""She keeps putting ideas about work in the minds of my men.

The script sparkles with wise-cracking dialogue, and the action proceeds headlong in unpredictable directions. It is the sort of movie that the phrase ""never a dull moment"" was coined for. The two leads did full justice to their parts, but they lacked the star status to impress the critics. If Claudette Colbert and Cary Grant had been cast, or Jean Arthur and Jimmy Stewart, they could have performed no better, but this film would now be assured of its place in the annals of screwball comedy instead of being neglected and almost forgotten.",5,Good Film,1234396800,"02 12, 2009",2009,801,"['Hollywood', 'treatment', 'problems', 'returning', 'servicemen', 'World', 'War', '2', 'took', 'many', 'forms', 'sob', 'stories', 'psychological', 'dramas', 'films', 'noirs', 'even', 'musicals', 'film', 'unusual', 'perhaps', 'even', 'unique', 'giving', 'irreverent', 'screwball', 'slant', 'script', 'wise-cracking', 'dialogue', 'action', 'proceeds', 'headlong', 'unpredictable', 'directions', 'sort', 'movie', 'phrase', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'was', 'coined', 'two', 'leads', 'did', 'full', 'justice', 'parts', 'lacked', 'star', 'status', 'impress', 'critics', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'had', 'been', 'cast', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'could', 'have', 'performed', 'better', 'film', 'would', 'now', 'be', 'assured', 'place', 'annals', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'instead', 'being', 'neglected', 'almost', 'forgotten']",The Admiral Was a Lady

Even in the 21st century, I was thoroughly entertained by it.*It's a story of four ex-airmen who receive unemployment checks until complications begin when they meet an ex-WAC. As the story develops, the jilted WAC is taken under the protection of the airmen. She learns how they make extra income without working. And they go to great lengths to maintain the status of the idle.*At the threat of being employed, the airmen have to keep her with them for three days. The antics that follow are hilarious. As the film advances towards the end, she learns they are committed to staying together until each one of them can live their life on their own. View this film and you will learn why and how they did it.*One of the actors in this movie was Rudy Vallee who was a leading romance actor of his time but he took second billing under Edmond O'Brien and Wanda Hendrix.

Then it turns around when her fiance that she was waiting in town for two weeks for stands her up.  She continues to be harassed by four vets, but for a brief minute of sympathy, it is okay, then it gets irritating again.  I don't think she is an admiral as it says in the description/title, and then a little later they are calling her admiral and I am not sure why.  The vets want to remain unemployed and get blackmailed by a businessman to keep  the ensign/admiral in town for one more day to meet up with her fiance Henry, or they will have to go to work.
