Masterfully accomplished.I'll defend this at some other point, but right here I'll just add that I think gore hounds and scream queens and body melt fans and all the quibbling critics in the horror world should just band together and say that when David Edelstein coined the term ""torture porn"" he hit the nail right on the head. It is a freaking awesome name for a really twisted sub genre that only a few can handle, and that's how it should be.Which brings me to the Collector, who is not only a seminal figure in Torture Porn, but also the second scariest on screen serial killer I have seen...I used to doubt my judgment on that. I would say: but the guy's no Hannibal Lecter, right? And Lecter won the Oscar, which means he's the quality king, mother approved, case closed. Right?Absolutely not.Remember whenHannibalcame out and all sorts of exposition and background stuff about Hannibal Lector came to the foreground and the dude just went from scary to frankly goofy.Well get this: Nobody ever, not once, gives us a hint at what is driving the Collector.Well, surely a smart analyst would start piecing apart the things that the Collector says to, say, his victims.

How did he find the time to set up each room with these carefully put together traps?  You'll be asking yourself the same questions, I guarantee it.Some of the violence is gruesome to the point that your stomach will probably turn because it involves body parts being removed, such as teeth and intestines.

They just want blood and cringe-inducing shots of sharp object penetrating the skin. If you want to make that kind of movie, fine, but don't bother trying to give it context. Just go for the jugular, figuratively and literally. At least then you'll have a film with conviction. ""The Collector"" goes wrong by wanting to be both a gritty gore fest and a character-driven story with a moral to it. In my opinion, that's a contradiction in terms.I guess I shouldn't have expected anything more, seeing as it was written by Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan, who also wrote the fourth, fifth, and sixth installments of the equally torturous ""Saw"" series. Did they take inspiration from a 1965 film also titled ""The Collector,"" which tells the story of a lonely young man who kidnaps a woman and keeps her just because it makes him happy? Maybe so, even though it was never advertised as a remake; the 2009 film tells the story of a man who targets families and kidnaps certain people and keeps them locked in a trunk. There's also the fact that the 1965 film prominently features butterflies while the 2009 film occasionally features various kinds of bugs, including roaches, wasps, and spiders. But I'm looking too deeply into this. The people behind 2009's ""The Collector"" don't stop to consider such details.The completely unnecessary back story focuses on Arkin (Josh Stewart), a repairman who plans to rob the home of a rich jewel broker so that his wife can pay off a loan shark. The wife's problem: She needs the money by tonight. Arkin promises he can get it to her by midnight and goes back to his clients' home, believing they've gone out of town. The home is a sprawling southern-style mansion that, of course, is in the middle of nowhere (Southern Californians will be quick to notice that the front looks similar to Disneyland's Haunted Mansion). Upon entering, Arkin discovers that virtually every room is rigged with an elaborate series of booby traps, all attached to a system of wires stretched from wall to wall. Worse still, a masked man who never speaks roams the house, and he already has the husband and wife (Michael Reilly Burke and Andrea Roth) bound and bloodied up down in the basement. The younger daughter (Karley Scott Collins) is missing. Only the older daughter (Madeline Zima) seems to have gotten away.Now Arkin is faced with a dilemma: Does he rob the house and leave, or does he stay and try to save the family? Had the film not been so insistent with lingering shots of hooks, knives, and various other metal tips painfully piercing someone's flesh, I might have actually cared. But for this movie, that's impossible--there's no conceivable way for us to care when blood and torture are being shoved into our faces. And yet they keep trying. One of the motivating factors for Arkin is the missing younger daughter, whose name is Hannah; apparently, she reminds him of his own daughter, Cindy (Haley Pullos). Why take the time to create these characters at all? Why include an emotional subplot? The end of the film goes for typical horror movie overkill, and that only achieves shock value, not a genuine emotional payoff. At that point in the film, both Hannah and Cindy are conveniently forgotten.So is the story, which brings me back to my original complaint: ""The Collector"" is a film that's not ambitious enough to be a straight-up torture flick. It tries to even things out with a plot, only to eventually realize that it never needed one. I'm usually the first to criticize a film for putting style over substance, but in the case of torture flicks, style is really all they have to fall back on. A plotless succession of gore and physical pain could never be considered entertainment, but at least it could be said that it delivered exactly what it promised. When you include a story that tries to make a point, you're aiming too high.Such is the failure of ""The Collector,"" a brutal, blood-soaked horror tale that can't decide what it wants it be. Had it been true to itself, the fact that the titular character is a complete mystery wouldn't be a problem. But because the filmmakers went for a story, we find ourselves completely at a loss to account for the Collector, least of all his ability to rig an entire house with booby traps. What's the deal with the room with acidic glue poured all over the floor? And why did that scene require the gruesome death of a cat? Is it now a rule that any horror film featuring an animal must have a scene of it dying? But I'm rambling. The real problem this film suffers from is a lack of conviction. If you want to make a torture flick, make a torture flick--don't put any effort into a story that ultimately no one will care about.",2,Home Invasion Horror,1250208000,"08 14,

1317898,A16ZCVDIFWONW,B0031U8OEK,C. Loescher,"[3, 5]","Name-dropping is an extremely common tactic in cinema, and much to the chagrin of movie fans who would just as soon save twenty bucks, it usually works.  I suppose it would be difficult to not name-drop in some regard; how else, with the multitudes of movies many every year, would a film with no extremely well-known actors and actresses get any publicity at all?  The pushers of The Collector therefore chose to highlight two individuals involved with Saw IV, V, and VI fame, no doubt hoping that Saw franchise followers, of which there are throngs, would see The Collector and make it an overnight hit.  And me?  Of fulfilling the name-dropping purpose, I am 100% guilty, but unfortunately, would just as soon have saved twenty bucks.The opening of the film appears promising:  a man and a woman return home to find their power off, and discover a strange box in their bedroom that moves menacingly.  The ending of that scene, coupled with the imagery accompanying the electronic/industrial opening soundtrack, does in fact remind of Saw, but that's where the good similarities end.The Collector's central actor Josh Stewart, who looks as if he could be Sean Penn's younger brother, plays Arkin, a longtime handyman for a rich family.  Arkin's ex-wife has apparently accrued a sum of debt with loan sharks, and is relying upon Arkin to get her enough money to appease them.  Arkin, utilizing his ties with associates he met while in prison, enters an agreement with said associates whereby he will rob his employer in order to get money by midnight of the day in question.  As it turns out, his employer, played by Michael Reilly Burke (of the titular role in indie flick Ted Bundy), is a jewel broker, and has a safe hidden in his bedroom that contains a very large gem.  We also get glimpses into the lives of Burke's screen wife and two daughters, one a teen, and one much younger.  So far, so good - a story not that much out of the ordinary, and an intriguing movie intro that implies Arkin will run into similar happenstance.This is the point at which the movie's plot starts to unravel.  After determining that the family would be gone on vacation, Arkin enters the home to burglarize it.  Right away he is met with danger, as he hears another person enter.  During Arkin's evasion of this other figure, he finds that not only is the family still at home, but they are being held and tortured, and the house is filled with traps (razor wire, acid, knives, and the like).  Arkin chooses not to rob the family, but instead, attempts to save their lives from this malevolent invader.  Okay, I'll buy it, but the rest had better be good.Unfortunately, cliched scenes follow, especially akin to the Saw franchise and Hostel.  Blood?  Check.  Gore?  Check.  Nudity?  Check.  But the main problem?  None of the scenes are as inventive, scary, or gruesome as the aforementioned, a fact which would be redeemable with a thrilling story.  Throughout the course of the film from the above point on, I was entertained, but only just enough to not be bored.  And when The Collector came to a close, I couldn't help but think: that's it?  Simply put, save your twenty bucks and your next hour-and-a-half.  The Collector, though an interesting idea, fails to match its own ambition, and should only be seen by those desperate for gore before the next Saw entry.",2,"A Poor Man's ""Saw,"" but Worse...",1257120000,"11 2, 2009",2009,3356,"['Name-dropping', 'extremely', 'common', 'tactic', 'cinema', 'much', 'chagrin', 'movie', 'fans', 'who', 'would', 'just', 'as', 'soon', 'save', 'twenty', 'bucks', 'usually', 'suppose', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'not', 'name-drop', 'regard', 'how', 'else', 'multitudes', 'movies', 'many', 'year', 'would', 'film', 'extremely', 'well-known', 'actors', 'actresses', 'get', 'publicity', 'pushers', 'Collector', 'therefore', 'chose', 'highlight', 'two', 'individuals', 'involved', 'Saw', 'IV', 'V', 'VI', 'fame', 'doubt', 'hoping', 'Saw', 'franchise', 'followers', 'are', 'throngs', 'would', 'see', 'Collector', 'make', 'overnight', 'hit', 'fulfilling', 'name-dropping', 'purpose', 'am', '100', '%', 'guilty', 'unfortunately', 'would', 'just', 'as', 'soon', 'have', 'saved', 'twenty', 'bucks.The', 'opening', 'film', 'promising', 'man', 'woman', 'return', 'home', 'find', 'power', 'discover', 'strange', 'box', 'bedroom', 'menacingly', 'ending', 'scene', 'coupled', 'imagery', 'accompanying', 'electronic/industrial', 'opening', 'soundtrack', 'fact', 'remind', 'Saw', 'where', 'good', 'similarities', 'end.The', 'Collector', 'central', 'actor', 'Josh', 'Stewart', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'younger', 'brother', 'Arkin', 'longtime', 'handyman', 'rich', 'family', 'Arkin', 'ex-wife', 'apparently', 'accrued', 'sum', 'debt', 'loan', 'sharks', 'relying', 'Arkin', 'get', 'enough', 'money', 'appease', 'Arkin', 'utilizing', 'ties', 'associates', 'met', 'prison', 'agreement', 'said', 'associates', 'whereby', 'will', 'rob', 'employer', 'order', 'get', 'money', 'midnight', 'day', 'question', 'out', 'employer', 'played', 'Michael', 'Reilly', 'Burke', 'titular', 'role', 'indie', 'flick', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'jewel', 'broker', 'safe', 'hidden', 'bedroom', 'very', 'large', 'gem', 'also', 'get', 'glimpses', 'lives', 'Burke', 'screen', 'wife', 'two', 'daughters', 'one', 'teen', 'one', 'much', 'younger', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'story', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'ordinary', 'intriguing', 'movie', 'intro', 'Arkin', 'will', 'run', 'similar', 'happenstance.This', 'point', 'movie', 'plot', 'unravel', 'determining', 'family', 'would', 'be', 'gone', 'vacation', 'Arkin', 'home', 'burglarize', 'Right', 'away', 'met', 'danger', 'person', 'enter', 'Arkin', 'evasion', 'other', 'figure', 'not', 'only', 'family', 'still', 'home', 'are', 'being', 'held', 'tortured', 'house', 'filled', 'traps', 'razor', 'wire', 'acid', 'knives', 'like', 'Arkin', 'not', 'rob', 'family', 'instead', 'attempts', 'save', 'lives', 'malevolent', 'invader', 'Okay', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'rest', 'had', 'better', 'be', 'good.Unfortunately', 'cliched', 'scenes', 'follow', 'especially', 'akin', 'Saw', 'franchise', 'Hostel', 'Blood', 'Check', 'Gore', 'Check', 'Nudity', 'Check', 'main', 'problem', 'None', 'scenes', 'are', 'inventive', 'scary', 'gruesome', 'aforementioned', 'fact', 'would', 'be', 'redeemable', 'thrilling', 'story', 'course', 'film', 'above', 'point', 'was', 'entertained', 'only', 'just', 'enough', 'not', 'be', 'bored', 'when', 'Collector', 'came', 'close', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'Simply', 'put', 'save', 'twenty', 'bucks', 'next', 'hour-and-a-half', 'Collector', 'interesting', 'idea', 'match', 'own', 'ambition', 'should', 'only', 'be', 'seen', 'desperate', 'gore', 'next', 'Saw', 'entry']",N/A

The basic premise of a 'Collector' torturing people in a booby-trapped set-up was a great idea, and the atmostphere was oppressing for much of the film- that is, 'Get out of the House!'. A great twist on the horror idea, where you usually want to be INSIDE and safe from things. The dilema set up for the main character, a would-be thief who is constantly choosing between fight or flight was also a good horror element. A thief versus a psycho-killer, a cat-and-mouse game was a clever moral barometer for the audience and another great twist the film had going for it too- so two horror 'high-brow' concepts were included in the film that were effective and displayed in an inventive and creative way. Unfortunately little else in the film was done as well.The major problem this film had going for it was sheer believability. Booby-trapping an entire house in the span of an afternoon? The size of the house, from the outside in comparison to the inside. The one sided hearing abilities of the protagonist versus the antagonist. The seeming omnipresence of the thief and his ability to not trigger any traps. The invulnerability of the 'Collector'. The 'Collector's' escape after getting hurt and being surrounded by cops...The list goes on. It's obvious the laws of reality weren't the least concern for the makers of the film, even though they tried hard to insert the feel, which they did effectively, of setting up a most horrible version of a home invasion.After the plot hole problem, was the basic problem with character development and storyline- both completely absent. But again, the movie was designed simply to move you from killing scene to killing scene, make you tense, and show you gore- which it does. There are some great splatter-scenes, and the realism of the kill-scenes are top-notch. But ultimately, the film is too unbelievable to be more than a torture-feast, taking itself entirely too serious, but insulting the audience with it's shotgun sized story-holes. Too bad, because the thief-pscyho dynamic was a great idea, and the suspense was great through most of the film- until you started to actually think about what was going on and how unbelivable it was, and then you just got annoyed. In alot of ways, the title of the film, and how little it actually had to do with what happened in the film, other than being the opening and ending scenes, and it's single sprinkling in the rest of the movie sums up the gist of the film-""This is the movie you are watching, we aren't going to bother even thinking twice about what's going on, and you better not either, or the house will crumble.""

The two have worked together on the Saw movies installments 4, 5, 6, and the upcoming 7 so that fact that this movie is ""Saw"" meets ""Home Alone"" is a very accurate statement. The premise is that a down-on-his-luck father needs some money by midnight and decides to rob an employer while the family is on vacation. Unfortunately, someone else got there first and has set up a series of intricate, deadly booby traps top to bottom in this mansion.Josh Stewart stars as Arkin, a guy trying to get by on a honest day's pay for an honest day's work yadda yadda yadda, but when put in a crunch proves skilled at robberies in order to save his family from loan sharks. Little does he know that the second he enters this house, the probability of his ever seeing them again plummets dramatically. There is a dagger chandelier, an acid floor, fish hook curtains, boarded up windows rigged with razor blades, and trip wires everywhere. This is one intense journey into torture porn that only the strong can stomach. If you can't get enough ""Saw"" and wish Kevin had been just a little more naughty than paint cans in ""Home Alone"", this is your chance to see something spectacular. Cat-lovers, beware.This house is a maze of stairways, doorways, hallways, and it can get easy to get lost so the director does a great job of showing the audience where our ""hero""...er...""hero-ish guy"" is by raising the camera over the door frames through the ceiling so you can see where the good guy is and where the bad guy is easily. There is also different lighting throughout the house. Of course, most rooms are very dark but some have bluish tints and the basement has a creepy slimer-glow.This is one of the best scary movies I've seen in the last couple of years. There is no filler, very little exposition at the beginning, it just jumps right into the thrilling cat-and-mouse game where you keep waiting for the killer to discover someone else is in the house. One more scary note: the killer likes to put people in boxes.This film also features a quick cameo from Claire's lesbian college friend in ""Heroes"" and yes, she gets topless so...enjoy that, I guess.End verdict: go rent this for thrills and chills.

He's vulnerable, realistic, and a very well done, albeit underdeveloped character.On the other hand, the setup, story, and character development is fairly nonexistent; and that's the problem.  No real reasoning is given for the pointless murders, other than the killer lives up to the movie's namesake: He's a collector.  In that respect, the movie is quite disappointing.  Meanwhile, the protagonist - if you can call him that - is Arkin (Josh Stewart), a repairman who takes jobs at large houses just so he can rob them later.  There is back story with his wife and a loan shark, but it's completely irrelevant to the moral dilemma he faces, whether it's fortune and flight, or a possibly fatal fight.  I'm not really sure why it was included, and the movie would have been better suited to have one more relative - perhaps an alcoholic uncle staying on vacation - to eviscerate in a ridiculously contrived manner.  Story and character development is simply non-existent or unimportant to the filmmaker's purposes.  It's essentially the Panic Room without either the panic or moral obligation - not to mention superior acting - of Forest Whitaker.The pace and tension, however, is very well done.  Dark, creative kills, realistic blood and gore, a wonderfully done disembowelment, and enough torture-porn to appease even the most ardent horror buff, but not the most keen cinema fan.Go to quicken your pace, to arrest your heartbeat, and to rip your fragile home-owner securities to shreds.

Richardson,"[11, 16]","This was a long awaited movie by me - the trailer was great, the hype about the makers of 2 SAW films was encouraging - what a let down, from the minute the film started. The film quality was poor like a B movie, unfortunately the acting & script was only slightly better !The story made very little sense if no sense - this guy ""the collector"" had to be some kind of superman to have converted a house from top to bottom with intricate traps & barriers in just a few hours. The main character could hear the slightest sound like a key in a lock and footsteps - but the Collector character seemed to be totally deaf, he could'nt hear the main character, walking, running around, slamming doors and drawers, talking loudly to other people & ripping and banging wood panels on the windows. The guy in the suitcase seemed to know exactly why he was in there - ""the bait"", for what and how did he know that ?? Considering there was traps all over the house, which from the outside was a big mansion - but inside seemed to be a three bedroom semi with a basement. Neither the main character or the Collector seemed to get caught up in the many traps - but all others did seem to fall prey.I want to know who these people are on here that gave this rubbish more than 1 star (absolutely NOT scary / very predictable / same old tired scenario of the killer gets overpowered & knocked out, then the hero leaves him to attack another day / the Collector uses a dead guys skull to smash a door through - WHY ? The skull would smash before a door would / somehow the vicious dog dies in a rubbish basket and gets thrown at the Collector like a rag doll dead / the ambulance tips over and crashes - we never discovered how that happened or how the Collector got past the police cordon in a van that had to have been hidden away after he had a chandelier covered in knives dropped on him - i could go on and on ! Not as much gore as intimated by other reviewers, the gore had already taken place, you mostly see bodies and the after effects.God help us all - the unkillable (if that's a word) Collector seems to be set for a sequel at the end - please NO NO ! Oh yeah - I forgot to mention, when you watch the Collector closely when he walks - he obviously suffers from some kind of rheumatism as he walks like he's disabled - but when you get a closer look at the rear of him it's obvious a pensioner is playing the part !",1,Who Are These People !!,1287792000,"10 23, 2010",2010,2409,"['was', 'long', 'awaited', 'movie', 'trailer', 'was', 'great', 'hype', 'makers', '2', 'SAW', 'films', 'was', 'encouraging', 'what', 'let', 'down', 'minute', 'film', 'started', 'film', 'quality', 'was', 'poor', 'B', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'acting', 'script', 'was', 'only', 'slightly', 'better', 'story', 'made', 'very', 'little', 'sense', 'sense', 'guy', 'collector', 'had', 'be', 'kind', 'superman', 'have', 'converted', 'house', 'top', 'bottom', 'intricate', 'traps', 'barriers', 'just', 'few', 'hours', 'main', 'character', 'could', 'hear', 'slightest', 'sound', 'key', 'lock', 'footsteps', 'Collector', 'character', 'seemed', 'be', 'totally', 'deaf', ""could'nt"", 'hear', 'main', 'character', 'walking', 'running', 'around', 'slamming', 'doors', 'drawers', 'talking', 'loudly', 'other', 'people', 'ripping', 'banging', 'wood', 'panels', 'windows', 'guy', 'suitcase', 'seemed', 'know', 'exactly', 'why', 'was', 'bait', 'what', 'how', 'did', 'know', 'Considering', 'was', 'traps', 'house', 'outside', 'was', 'big', 'mansion', 'inside', 'seemed', 'be', 'three', 'bedroom', 'semi', 'basement', 'main', 'character', 'Collector', 'seemed', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'many', 'traps', 'others', 'did', 'seem', 'fall', 'prey.I', 'want', 'know', 'who', 'people', 'are', 'here', 'gave', 'rubbish', 'more', '1', 'star', 'absolutely', 'NOT', 'scary', '/', 'very', 'predictable', '/', 'same', 'old', 'tired', 'scenario', 'killer', 'overpowered', 'knocked', 'out', 'then', 'hero', 'attack', 'day', '/', 'Collector', 'dead', 'guys', 'skull', 'smash', 'door', 'WHY', 'skull', 'would', 'smash', 'door', 'would', '/', 'somehow', 'vicious', 'dog', 'dies', 'rubbish', 'basket', 'thrown', 'Collector', 'rag', 'doll', 'dead', 'ambulance', 'tips', 'crashes', 'never', 'discovered', 'how', 'happened', 'how', 'Collector', 'got', 'police', 'cordon', 'van', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'hidden', 'away', 'had', 'chandelier', 'covered', 'knives', 'dropped', 'i', 'could', 'go', 'Not', 'much', 'gore', 'intimated', 'other', 'reviewers', 'gore', 'had', 'already', 'taken', 'place', 'mostly', 'see', 'bodies', 'effects.God', 'help', 'unkillable', 'word', 'Collector', 'be', 'set', 'sequel', 'end', 'please', 'NO', 'NO', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'forgot', 'mention', 'when', 'watch', 'Collector', 'closely', 'when', 'obviously', 'kind', 'rheumatism', 'disabled', 'when', 'get', 'closer', 'look', 'rear', 'obvious', 'pensioner', 'playing', 'part']",N/A

It does have a low budget, or so it seems, however the claustrophobic nature of the film does not require extensive financial presence. The protagonist in an interesting character - he is jaded (which is cliched now), but he is also not really a good guy. He does what he needs to do to survive. Once he gets into his bosses house to rob the place, the film just goes crazy. The traps that have been set are seemingly impossible to escape. I enjoyed the fact that our hero gets injured a lot on the way, rather than somehow missing all the traps and escaping unscathed. I found this movie really interesting to watch - sort of like a Saw film, except not as gruesome (not to me anyway) - and the endings in these films usually disappoint, but The Collector really got it right. The ending was superb.What let this movie down was that it failed to make itself unique in the sense that it was highly reminiscent of Saw. Now that The Collection has been released, this similarity grew even stronger, which prevents this film (and the sequel) from really growing into its own franchise.Overall, this film does take you on one hell of a ride, if you don't enjoy horror, then basically don't watch it.

1317961,ABFQUOV57SWOR,B0031U8OEK,robb1138,"[4, 6]","Yes I know - I butchered Mary Botham Howitt's poem title, but it aptly describes this movie. A movie worth watching, even if you are not a 'Saw' fan. The Collector has the makings of a more than usual horror movie with all the classic plot twists. The director, Marcus Dunstan and screen-writer Patrick Melton, do well by building our reluctant hero's character that we quickly come to know him well enough and empathize with him. Arkin, (played excellently by Josh Stewart) a recently released convict, a local handy-man working for the rich Chase family, shows some innocent kindness to the Chase's youngest daughter. When Hanna invites Arkin to an imaginary tea party, Arkin asks the 10 year old Hannah, ""what would you want if you could have anything in the world?"" Hannah's reply is, ""a Basket Bear"".The party is brief, cut short by the Hannah's father, Michael Chase - a jewelry broker, a fact that becomes salient to our plot a bit later. We meet, Michael's wife, Victoria, played by Andrea Roth, from Rescue Me - a vain woman who fears aging, and we also meet the family's angry, rebellious, teenager, Jill.Arkin's dilemma comes in the form of his daughter, Cindy and his shark in-debted ex-wife, Lisa. Lisa needs money by midnight, and Arkin, who had just presented his daughter the brand new 'Basket Bear', promises to get her the money by midnight. Another quick scene involving Arkin's crime associate, Roy, who is played by the relatively more experienced actor, Robert Wisdom, shows Arkin's motivation for returning to the Chase's mansion. Arkin wants to rob the Chase's while they are on vacation, steal a jewel, and split 50/50 with Roy the fence. And Arkin wants to do it by midnight, tonight. Roy, warning Arkin, ""Terrible thing happen when breaking their routine"".With all the introductions out of the way, the story moves quickly from here on out. The musical score works well by helping to bring the tension to the surface, building anxiety in the audience. Arkin sneaks back to the Chase's home and prepares to crack the safe hidden in the Chase's master bedroom behind a mirror. Arkin starts this movie, a flawed character, a desperate man, turning to crime to support his family. Do not worry; Arkin's position is about to get worse.Arkin, hearing noises in the supposedly empty house, just as he is about to crack the safe, realizes that he is not alone. In a manner of minutes, Arkin also quickly realizes that the house is booby-trapped, rigged like a spider's web, ready to spring its many death traps. Finding the adult members of the family still in the house, Arkin ventures to the basement, tortured by, the Collector, a sexual sadist hiding behind a wrestler's mask, funky green eyes burning with hatred from within. The DVD case for 'The Collector' describes this movie as a, ""cat and mouse chase"". And for the best portion of the movie, Arkin, playing the mouse, after trying to save what's left of the tortured family, found his opportunity to escape this deadly web. He now has the jewel; all he has to do is leave. ... But can he? The remainder of the movie is an epic battle of good and evil; Arkin battling the Collector for the soul of Hannah, the family's lone survivor.Take my humble advice and watch the opening scenes carefully for the Collector's method to his madness. Pay particular attention to the opening titles for clues on how to plan a deadly web of bear traps, a chandelier of knives, punji sticks on your stairwell, just to name a few. Watch carefully, at the beginning for the contents of the red chest left in the middle of the house. This is a good,  suspenseful, high energy, horror flick, good for a dark stormy night, and remember, ""If the Collector likes you, he keeps you; if he doesn't, he kills you.""",4,"Welcome to my parlor, said the spider to the fly!",1269129600,"03 21, 2010",2010,3766,"['Yes', 'know', 'butchered', 'Mary', 'Botham', 'Howitt', 'poem', 'title', 'aptly', 'movie', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'even', 'are', 'not', ""'Saw"", 'fan', 'Collector', 'makings', 'more', 'usual', 'horror', 'movie', 'classic', 'plot', 'twists', 'director', 'Marcus', 'Dunstan', 'screen-writer', 'Patrick', 'Melton', 'do', 'well', 'building', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'character', 'quickly', 'come', 'know', 'well', 'enough', 'empathize', 'Arkin', 'played', 'excellently', 'Josh', 'Stewart', 'recently', 'released', 'convict', 'local', 'handy-man', 'working', 'rich', 'Chase', 'family', 'innocent', 'kindness', 'Chase', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'When', 'Hanna', 'Arkin', 'imaginary', 'tea', 'party', 'Arkin', '10', 'year', 'old', 'Hannah', 'what', 'would', 'want', 'could', 'have', 'anything', 'world', 'Hannah', 'reply', 'Basket', 'Bear', '.The', 'party', 'brief', 'cut', 'short', 'Hannah', 'father', 'Michael', 'Chase', 'jewelry', 'broker', 'fact', 'salient', 'plot', 'bit', 'later', 'meet', 'Michael', 'wife', 'Victoria', 'played', 'Andrea', 'Roth', 'Rescue', 'Me', 'vain', 'woman', 'who', 'aging', 'also', 'meet', 'family', 'angry', 'rebellious', 'teenager', 'Jill.Arkin', 'dilemma', 'form', 'daughter', 'Cindy', 'shark', 'in-debted', 'ex-wife', 'Lisa', 'Lisa', 'money', 'midnight', 'Arkin', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'presented', 'daughter', 'brand', 'new', ""'Basket"", 'Bear', 'promises', 'get', 'money', 'midnight', 'quick', 'scene', 'involving', 'Arkin', 'crime', 'associate', 'Roy', 'who', 'played', 'relatively', 'more', 'experienced', 'actor', 'Robert', 'Wisdom', 'Arkin', 'motivation', 'returning', 'Chase', 'mansion', 'Arkin', 'rob', 'Chase', 'are', 'vacation', 'steal', 'jewel', 'split', '50/50', 'Roy', 'fence', 'Arkin', 'do', 'midnight', 'tonight', 'Roy', 'warning', 'Arkin', 'Terrible', 'thing', 'happen', 'when', 'breaking', 'routine', 'introductions', 'way', 'story', 'moves', 'quickly', 'here', 'out', 'musical', 'score', 'works', 'well', 'helping', 'bring', 'tension', 'surface', 'building', 'anxiety', 'audience', 'Arkin', 'back', 'Chase', 'home', 'prepares', 'crack', 'safe', 'hidden', 'Chase', 'master', 'bedroom', 'mirror', 'Arkin', 'movie', 'flawed', 'character', 'desperate', 'man', 'turning', 'crime', 'support', 'family', 'Do', 'not', 'worry', 'Arkin', 'position', 'get', 'worse.Arkin', 'hearing', 'noises', 'supposedly', 'empty', 'house', 'just', 'crack', 'safe', 'not', 'alone', 'manner', 'minutes', 'Arkin', 'also', 'quickly', 'house', 'booby-trapped', 'rigged', 'spider', 'web', 'ready', 'spring', 'many', 'death', 'traps', 'Finding', 'adult', 'members', 'family', 'still', 'house', 'Arkin', 'ventures', 'basement', 'tortured', 'Collector', 'sexual', 'sadist', 'hiding', 'wrestler', 'mask', 'funky', 'green', 'eyes', 'burning', 'hatred', 'DVD', 'case', ""'The"", 'Collector', 'describes', 'movie', 'cat', 'mouse', 'chase', 'best', 'portion', 'movie', 'Arkin', 'playing', 'mouse', 'trying', 'save', 'what', 'left', 'tortured', 'family', 'found', 'opportunity', 'escape', 'deadly', 'web', 'now', 'jewel', 'do', 'leave', 'can', 'remainder', 'movie', 'epic', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'Arkin', 'battling', 'Collector', 'soul', 'Hannah', 'family', 'lone', 'survivor.Take', 'humble', 'advice', 'watch', 'opening', 'scenes', 'carefully', 'Collector', 'method', 'madness', 'Pay', 'particular', 'attention', 'opening', 'titles', 'clues', 'how', 'plan', 'deadly', 'web', 'bear', 'traps', 'chandelier', 'knives', 'punji', 'sticks', 'stairwell', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'Watch', 'carefully', 'beginning', 'contents', 'red', 'chest', 'left', 'middle', 'house', 'good', 'suspenseful', 'high', 'energy', 'horror', 'flick', 'good', 'dark', 'stormy', 'night', 'remember', 'Collector', ""n't""]",N/A
1317962,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0031U8OEK,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 4]","The Collector (Marcus Dunstan, 2009)This will be a frustrating review to write, because almost everything that makes me rate the movie as low as I do can't be talked about without major spoilers. It could have been a fine, or at least a mediocre, little thriller; instead it comes off as a repository for all the traps they couldn't figure out how to shoehorn into the Saw movies (Dunstan and Melton have been responsible for that franchise since the fourth flick).Plot: Arkin (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button's Josh Stewart) is an ex-con who's trying to scrape up enough money to pay off his ex-wife's loan shark. He plots to rob the Chases, at whose house he was installing a security system earlier in the day. When he gets there, however, he discovers that he wasn't the only one casing the joint that day, and the other guy has a lot more than robbery on his mind. The house is turned into a criminal-vs.-criminal battlefield as Arkin tries to save young Hannah (The Hottie and the Nottie's Karley Scott Collins) from The Collector.Yes, it's a generic thriller, but generic thrillers can be done well. Dunstan and Melton have taken a few good lessons away from their days with the Saw flicks, most notably the effective use of chiaroscuro; this isn't the murky, dark camerawork of most low-budget horrorfests. It's actually quite a well-shot film. I have no complaints with the technical aspects of the movie, and that's pretty rare.Where it does go wrong is in the script, which Melton and Dunstan adapted from an earlier Dunstan story. Or so the credits tell us, but as I said, I think this was cribbed together from outtakes of Saw storyline meetings. ""Wouldn't a floor full of bear traps be cool? How about a chandelier with a bunch of knives tied to it?"" ""Yeah, but where would we put them in this movie?"" ""Oh, yeah, we'll save them for that non-Saw movie we've been talking about."" They threw in a few pieces of footage that will look very familiar to almost any horror fan who's been watching the past five years (the beginning of the movie is so reminiscent of the beginning of James Wan's Dead Silence that I had to check and see if Wan executive-produced the movie), and... here's where we get to spoiler territory. Let's just say nothing, but nothing, about this movie will even come close to surprising you. Disappointing you, yes, every ten minutes or so, but not surprising you.I'm not a fan of the term ""torture porn"", especially when it's applied to movies where it doesn't belong, but I can kind of understand it here. This movie has no reason for existence other than its traps. Sultry Heroes beauty Madeline Zima, one of a surprisingly high number of cameos in the film, gets briefly topless, and there are a whole lot of loving close-ups of nasty things (including a graphic scene of animal torture, so avoid if you find that sort of thing objectionable). But it could have been so very, very much more than that. **",2,I expected better from Melton and Dunstan?

When I first heard that the writers of Saw 4-6 were making another horror film I was a bit weary. They never felt to me to be the strongest movies in the Saw franchise and I really wasn't able to get drawn into them but I will be the first to admit that I was wrong. I will happily admit to being wrong as well since when they are creating something new and not using someone eles's material Marcus and Patrick can put together something amazing.The introduction to the film is pure character development without a hint of where the plot is going to go. We are introduced to Arkin (Josh Stewart) who at first appears to be a handyman helping restore a house. Its soon shown that this handy man is actually a thief who is casing the house looking for where a certain item is kept. He finally finds where the item is stored and soon finds out his wife owes a lot of money and has until midnight to pay. Knowing he is low on time he moves up to plotting the theft to that night though when he get's back to the house things are not as expected.While breaking into the safe Arkin hears someone else moving in the house and attempts to avoid him. He soon though stumbles across Michael(Michael Reilly Burke), the father, who looks beaten and is violently dragged from the room. It is at this point that the movie truly takes off and keeps up a great mixture of both suspense and action until the very end.Both Michael and his wife Victoria (Andrea Roth) are both being held captive by a mad man in a mask. Arkin quickly finds out that the entire house is set with traps and he must navigate through them to try both rescue the family and escape. While he attempts to rescue the parents he soon finds that both of their daughters Jill (Madeleine Zima) and Hannah (Karley Scott Collins) have not been caught by The Collector.As Arkin tries to save the family he is constantly having to hide from The Collector who appears to ""collect"" people for his own unknown reasons. Every time he is able to make progress either he or the parents are injured and when escape looms near the daughters are brought into the film. I won't go into the end of the film as you'll want to see the twists for yourself but I will say it is a fun romp in horror, gore, and suspense.Previously, as I said, I was completely iffy on the idea of Marcus and Patrick doing another horror film.

This movie is a little different, though watch for the promiscuous kids still having to die. This killer represents something else - maybe our own collective dark hearts. After all on some level, aren't we getting ""something"" from this entertainment, something that perhaps, deep down where the bowels meet the id, we actually desire?Anyways, that being said this movie is so full of plot holes there is no need to play the realism card.Why, when the nominal ""hero"" finds someone in the house does he always say ""Be quiet"" and then he NEVER says, ""The house is full of hideous traps""? Because, when he fails to say that, people immediately run off straight into the adjoining room and then into some huge steel mantrap or barbledy wire or bladed implements and die very bloodily.Realism in a movie such as this isn't necessary, but logical thought from characters should be.And yes, you can make an argument for a ""torture porn"" label for this, albeit a weak one.

Sometimes they do some amazing work, such as (Darren Lynn Bousman), who was involved in Repo: The Genetic Opera, one of the most interesting musicals ever. While it wasn't gory like Saw, you could see the Saw influence in the film style, and it made for a great movie. On the flip side of that, there's also some films, such as Dead Silence (written by James Wan), which had nothing spectacular about it but was at least was a ""decent"" film. Coming into The Collector (written by Marcus Dunstan, who did Saw IV/V/VI, and soon VII), the movie could have went either way with the Saw alum track record, but I'm pleased as a whole to say it was one of the better showings thus far.The Collector is a horror film that starts off like a drama, but quickly takes a turn into the horror/gore genre. Arkin (Josh Stewart) is a handyman who's also a thief, and the movie starts off with him starting to eye up his next big heist. After finishing up his work, he goes to meet his business partner Roy (Robert Wisdom) to discuss when the job will take place. Arkin is in a rush to get the robbery done, because he needs to pay off some of his wife's ""loans"", so that nothing happens to either her or his daughter. After convincing Roy that the job has to happen tonight, he heads on his way back to the house that he was working at earlier in the day. As soon as he steps in, and begins to break into the house, everything starts going wrong, and he needs to not only try to finish the robbery, but he finds the family members trapped in the house along the way, and feels the urge to try to save them from the torturous situation they're in.The entire movie is great, other then one or two glaring flaws that I'll explain shortly. Everything about this movie hits the way it should. The gore scenes are pretty gross and flinch-worthy, and will definitely leave some of the more squeamish people looking away from their TV. The characters are memorable, and you'll find yourself rooting not only for Arkin to get out of the house, but for the other family members to be saved.Since I mentioned that the movie was written by some of the Saw team, it's worth pointing out that you can definitely tell that this movie is Saw inspired...Not only by the traps and gore that line the movie, but even with the film techniques, such as using a yellow hue on the film when showing a lot of the gore scenes or the industrial music that scores the film.The greatest flaw of this movie is that the plot to the film just instantly changes about twenty minutes in or so. The film's plot, or the plot that was advertised with the film, is that Arkin needs to steal to get money to save his wife/daughter. They go through a lot of work to set up the film to seem like a heist flick, and then out of nowhere, it turns into the escape from the haunted house from hell. Along with that, they never explain anything about the killer himself...No reason of why he picked that house, no reason of why he's the way he is, no exposition what-so-ever. And yes, it's a horror movie, but that doesn't mean that they shouldn't at least give SOME reason that the killer is the way that he is.The other glaring flaw of this movie is the house that everything takes place in. I realize that sounds really odd, but let me explain. When Arkin is first scoping out the house, there's absolutely nothing odd about it. Then, when he breaks back into the house later, there's nothing weird going on. But as soon as he touches the safe, the entire house becomes booby trapped. And it's not just small traps like ""Oh, I tripped over this wire, and I fell down the steps"", it's huge things like a staircase covered with nails, the door suddenly having seven broken deadbolts installed, or a trip wire trap that runs the entire house INCLUDING the room that Arkin is trying to crack the safe in. Even though it's a horror movie, and they usually don't make perfect sense, it's distracting in this movie that the entire house magically goes from family home to death trap in a matter of seconds.As a whole, I really enjoyed this movie for the most part, other then some of the things I named that I feel like were a distraction. For the Saw fans, or anyone who likes a good film about being trapped, I would highly recommend this. There's also a neat throwback to the first Saw movie in the ending, but I won't spoil it in the review.",4,My review,1279670400,"07 21, 2010",2010,4508,"['someone', 'who', 'Saw', 'franchise', 'always', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'writers/producers', 'do', 'separate', 'series', 'Sometimes', 'do', 'amazing', 'work', 'such', 'Darren', 'Lynn', 'Bousman', 'who', 'was', 'involved', 'Repo', 'Genetic', 'Opera', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'musicals', 'ever', 'was', ""n't"", 'gory', 'Saw', 'could', 'see', 'Saw', 'influence', 'film', 'style', 'made', 'great', 'movie', 'flip', 'side', 'also', 'films', 'such', 'Dead', 'Silence', 'written', 'James', 'Wan', 'had', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'was', 'least', 'was', 'decent', 'film', 'Coming', 'Collector', 'written', 'Marcus', 'Dunstan', 'who', 'did', 'Saw', 'IV/V/VI', 'soon', 'VII', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'went', 'way', 'Saw', 'alum', 'track', 'record', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'whole', 'say', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'showings', 'thus', 'far.The', 'Collector', 'horror', 'film', 'drama', 'quickly', 'turn', 'horror/gore', 'genre', 'Arkin', 'Josh', 'Stewart', 'handyman', 'who', 'also', 'thief', 'movie', 'starting', 'eye', 'up', 'next', 'big', 'heist', 'finishing', 'up', 'work', 'meet', 'business', 'partner', 'Roy', 'Robert', 'Wisdom', 'discuss', 'when', 'job', 'will', 'take', 'place', 'Arkin', 'rush', 'get', 'robbery', 'done', 'pay', 'off', 'wife', 'loans', 'nothing', 'either', 'daughter', 'convincing', 'Roy', 'job', 'happen', 'tonight', 'way', 'back', 'house', 'was', 'working', 'earlier', 'day', 'As', 'soon', 'break', 'house', 'everything', 'going', 'wrong', 'not', 'only', 'try', 'finish', 'robbery', 'family', 'members', 'trapped', 'house', 'way', 'urge', 'try', 'save', 'torturous', 'situation', ""'re"", 'in.The', 'entire', 'movie', 'great', 'other', 'then', 'one', 'two', 'glaring', 'flaws', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'shortly', 'Everything', 'movie', 'way', 'should', 'gore', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'gross', 'flinch-worthy', 'will', 'definitely', 'leave', 'more', 'squeamish', 'people', 'looking', 'away', 'TV', 'characters', 'are', 'memorable', ""'ll"", 'find', 'rooting', 'not', 'only', 'Arkin', 'get', 'house', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'be', 'saved.Since', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'Saw', 'team', 'worth', 'pointing', 'out', 'can', 'definitely', 'tell', 'movie', 'Saw', 'inspired', 'Not', 'only', 'traps', 'gore', 'line', 'movie', 'even', 'film', 'techniques', 'such', 'using', 'yellow', 'hue', 'film', 'when', 'showing', 'lot', 'gore', 'scenes', 'industrial', 'music', 'film.The', 'greatest', 'flaw', 'movie', 'plot', 'film', 'just', 'instantly', 'changes', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'film', 'plot', 'plot', 'was', 'advertised', 'film', 'Arkin', 'steal', 'get', 'money', 'save', 'wife/daughter', 'go', 'lot', 'work', 'set', 'up', 'film', 'seem', 'heist', 'flick', 'then', 'nowhere', 'escape', 'haunted', 'house', 'hell', 'never', 'explain', 'anything', 'killer', 'reason', 'why', 'picked', 'house', 'reason', 'why', 'way', 'exposition', 'what-so-ever', 'yes', 'horror', 'movie', ""n't"", 'mean', 'should', ""n't"", 'least', 'give', 'SOME', 'reason', 'killer', 'way', 'other', 'glaring', 'flaw', 'movie', 'house', 'everything', 'place', 'realize', 'really', 'odd', 'let', 'explain', 'When', 'Arkin', 'first', 'scoping', 'out', 'house', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'odd', 'Then', 'when', 'back', 'house', 'later', 'nothing', 'weird', 'going', 'as', 'soon', 'safe', 'entire', 'house', 'booby', 'trapped', 'not', 'just', 'small', 'traps', 'Oh', 'tripped', 'wire', 'fell', 'down', 'steps', 'huge', 'things', 'staircase', 'covered', 'nails', 'door', 'suddenly', 'having', 'seven', 'broken', 'deadbolts', 'installed', 'trip', 'wire', 'trap', 'entire', 'house', 'room', 'Arkin', 'trying', 'crack', 'safe', 'Even', 'horror', 'movie', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'perfect', 'sense', 'distracting', 'movie', 'entire', 'house', 'magically', 'family', 'home', 'death', 'trap', 'matter', 'seconds.As', 'whole', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'other', 'then', 'things', 'named', 'feel', 'were', 'distraction', 'Saw', 'fans', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'film', 'being', 'trapped', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'also', 'neat', 'throwback', 'first', 'Saw', 'movie', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'review']",N/A

The acting was not horrible and the gore was cool. The traps were scary and the fact that they didn't show the killer's face I liked. Also the humanity of the little Girl and the guy not bailing on her. I did have one complaint in that the audio was not very good. I kept adjusting the volume to hear them speak then all of the sudden a scream would come blaring out of the speakers! LOL! All in all though worth watching for sure.

1317980,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0031U8OEK,trebe,"[2, 3]","It's completely unbelievable, but The Collector (2009) is still quite entertaining, if you are into twisted sadistic horror, and enjoy some mean and nasty kills, as a man bent on robbery, finds himself part of a deadly game, matching wits with a mysterious masked killer.  The film is co-written by Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton, one of the more prolific horror writing teams currently around.  The pair's credits include the Feast series, Saw IV, Saw V, Saw VI, Saw 3D, and Piranha 3D.  Directed by Dunstan, The Collector has an atmosphere similar to a Saw film, where it requires that you suspend disbelief in order to go on a very dark journey that can be fun for some, but is not for everybody.A man named Arkin (Josh Stewart) is one of several contractors working at the home of Michael Chase (Michael Reilly Burke), an affluent jewelry broker.  The Chase family includes wife Victoria (Andrea Roth), and daughters Jill (Madeline Zima), and youngster Hannah (Karley Scott Collins).  When Arkin's ex-wife (Daniella Alphonso) tells him that she needs cash in a hurry to pay off some loan sharks, Arkin decides to break into the Chase home, since they will be away on vacation.On the way to the residence, Arkin narrowly avoids being mauled by a dog that is chained to a stake in the yard.  The presence of the dog at a home that is supposed to be empty, might serve as a clue that something may be amiss.  Entering the house Arkin is about to open the safe in the upstairs bedroom, when he discovers that he is not alone.  The Chase family never left, and are being held captive by a man wearing a mask who has clearly been abusing them.  A terrified Victoria asks Arkin to save her daughter Hannah, who she believes is hiding somewhere in the house.  In part because he also has a young daughter, Arkin attempts to save the family.Like a Saw film, a number of elaborate and diabolical traps are featured.  Setup throughout the house, the traps are outrageously ridiculous, like something Wylie Coyote would have dreamed up to kill the Roadrunner.  The results are fascinating, when the traps are sprung.  A highlight is one where the victim is launched into a board with nails driven into it and impaled, with one eye slightly displaced by a nail passing through it. This touch shows attention to detail.  Another setup featuring a series of bear traps, is more crude and excessive.  In setting up the myriad of traps, The Collector apparently a lot of time on his hands.  What motivates him isn't clear, but what he apparently collects are people he finds of interest, who he stuffs into a small storage chest.A pivotal moment occurs after Arkin has escaped from the house, and sees Hannah calling to him from an upstairs window, with The Collector's shadow visible in a downstairs window.  Arkin returns to the house, and things become very personal between The Collector and Arkin, as he attempts to get Hannah out alive.This is a surrealistic journey, with little that stands up to any kind of examination.  Besides the unbelievable traps, the way Arkin is able to freely move through the house, without getting killed by the traps, or detected by The Collector, is pretty improbable.  The film's finish emphasizes the point that there are no logical limits on what can happen, and that safety really doesn't exist.  Like most of Dunstan's and Melton's projects, this one is edgy, and extremely violent.  More of a horror fantasy, plot development is weak, but for pure impact and execution, the film scores high marks.  If you are a fan of the Saw series, you may appreciate the deadly sense of peril and dark tone of The Collector.  It's not perfect, but earns a rating of four and a half stars, mainly because there isn't much more that could have been added to the story, which concludes outrageously, setting the stage for a follow up.  As of this date, the sequel titled `The Collection' is reportedly in post-production, with Josh Stewart returning as Arkin.",4,a masked killer apparently inspired by Wylie Coyote...,1309046400,"06 26, 2011",2011,3977,"['completely', 'unbelievable', 'Collector', '2009', 'still', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'are', 'twisted', 'sadistic', 'horror', 'enjoy', 'mean', 'nasty', 'kills', 'man', 'bent', 'robbery', 'part', 'deadly', 'game', 'matching', 'wits', 'mysterious', 'masked', 'killer', 'film', 'co-written', 'Marcus', 'Dunstan', 'Patrick', 'Melton', 'one', 'more', 'prolific', 'horror', 'writing', 'teams', 'currently', 'pair', 'credits', 'include', 'Feast', 'series', 'Saw', 'IV', 'Saw', 'V', 'Saw', 'VI', 'Saw', '3D', 'Piranha', '3D', 'Directed', 'Dunstan', 'Collector', 'atmosphere', 'similar', 'Saw', 'film', 'where', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'order', 'go', 'very', 'dark', 'journey', 'can', 'be', 'fun', 'not', 'everybody.A', 'man', 'named', 'Arkin', 'Josh', 'Stewart', 'one', 'several', 'contractors', 'working', 'home', 'Michael', 'Chase', 'Michael', 'Reilly', 'Burke', 'affluent', 'jewelry', 'broker', 'Chase', 'family', 'wife', 'Victoria', 'Andrea', 'Roth', 'daughters', 'Jill', 'Madeline', 'Zima', 'youngster', 'Hannah', 'Karley', 'Scott', 'Collins', 'When', 'Arkin', 'ex-wife', 'Daniella', 'Alphonso', 'cash', 'hurry', 'pay', 'off', 'loan', 'sharks', 'Arkin', 'break', 'Chase', 'home', 'will', 'be', 'away', 'way', 'residence', 'Arkin', 'narrowly', 'being', 'mauled', 'dog', 'chained', 'stake', 'yard', 'presence', 'dog', 'home', 'supposed', 'be', 'empty', 'might', 'serve', 'clue', 'something', 'may', 'be', 'amiss', 'Entering', 'house', 'Arkin', 'open', 'safe', 'upstairs', 'bedroom', 'when', 'not', 'alone', 'Chase', 'family', 'never', 'left', 'are', 'being', 'held', 'captive', 'man', 'wearing', 'mask', 'who', 'clearly', 'been', 'abusing', 'terrified', 'Victoria', 'Arkin', 'save', 'daughter', 'Hannah', 'who', 'hiding', 'somewhere', 'house', 'part', 'also', 'young', 'daughter', 'Arkin', 'save', 'family.Like', 'Saw', 'film', 'number', 'elaborate', 'diabolical', 'traps', 'are', 'featured', 'Setup', 'house', 'traps', 'are', 'outrageously', 'ridiculous', 'something', 'Wylie', 'Coyote', 'would', 'have', 'dreamed', 'up', 'kill', 'Roadrunner', 'results', 'are', 'fascinating', 'when', 'traps', 'are', 'sprung', 'highlight', 'one', 'where', 'victim', 'launched', 'board', 'nails', 'driven', 'impaled', 'one', 'eye', 'slightly', 'displaced', 'nail', 'passing', 'touch', 'attention', 'detail', 'setup', 'featuring', 'series', 'bear', 'traps', 'more', 'crude', 'excessive', 'setting', 'up', 'myriad', 'traps', 'Collector', 'apparently', 'lot', 'time', 'hands', 'What', ""n't"", 'clear', 'what', 'apparently', 'are', 'people', 'interest', 'who', 'small', 'storage', 'chest.A', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'occurs', 'Arkin', 'escaped', 'house', 'Hannah', 'calling', 'upstairs', 'window', 'Collector', 'shadow', 'visible', 'downstairs', 'window', 'Arkin', 'house', 'things', 'become', 'very', 'personal', 'Collector', 'Arkin', 'get', 'Hannah', 'alive.This', 'surrealistic', 'journey', 'little', 'up', 'kind', 'examination', 'unbelievable', 'traps', 'way', 'Arkin', 'able', 'freely', 'move', 'house', 'getting', 'killed', 'traps', 'detected', 'Collector', 'pretty', 'improbable', 'film', 'finish', 'point', 'are', 'logical', 'limits', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'safety', 'really', ""n't"", 'exist', 'most', 'Dunstan', 'Melton', 'projects', 'one', 'edgy', 'extremely', 'violent', 'More', 'horror', 'fantasy', 'plot', 'development', 'weak', 'pure', 'impact', 'execution', 'film', 'scores', 'high', 'marks', 'are', 'fan', 'Saw', 'series', 'may', 'appreciate', 'deadly', 'sense', 'peril', 'dark', 'tone', 'Collector', 'not', 'perfect', 'rating', 'four', 'half', 'stars', 'mainly', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'story', 'outrageously', 'setting', 'stage', 'follow', 'up', 'date', 'sequel', 'titled', 'Collection', 'reportedly', 'post-production', 'Josh', 'Stewart', 'returning', 'Arkin']",N/A

It is often dizzying, jolting and confusing, therefore adding to emotionally disruptive nature of this horror film.  Sure the killer was just a guy in a mask, but he has a unique attribute or two that make him genuinely creepy.  Most of the traps are fun and well executed.  I wish the story focused a little more on the traps and a little less on the torture though.This movie was shot on Super 16mm so it is very grainy.  I would avoid spending the extra $$ on the Blu-Ray.  I learned my lesson with Rob Zombie's Halloween 2.  As with any 16mm film, such as these two or Ti West's House of the Devil, the appearance of film grain will peak during dark sequence, and in Hi-Def, I find it distracting and hard to see what's happening sometimes.The Collector was bloody, brutal and original.  There were at least three instances where I caught myself saying, ""I've never seen that before!""  Written and rejected as a prequel to Saw, I doubt we will get to see The Collector again, but who knows.

Or as the old timers called them, a gutting knife.Such was my fear-filled imagination growing up at a time that horror movies were targeted at drug induced keg partying teenagers. Watching the movie ""The Collector"" brought back some of those fearful memories from that horrific era of movie watching. A time where the anticipation of what was going to happen tightened the fear in you like a pulled bow string.This movie doesn't use the CGI tricks or creative applied make-up tactics to get a yell out of you. Instead, its a suspense-thriller that puts you in the shoes of those who are stalked. Oh, there's blood alright, but its the method of the madness causing the blood to splatter that makes you cringe.You'll catch yourself watching and thinking at first that its not so bad a situation. But then as the little observations you've made start adding up and you begin to feel as if there's no escape, as if the closet you're locked inside is closing in on you, your calm-while-in-the-storm style begins to wear thin and the panic clock ticks just a bit faster. You want out.And just as you think you've finally....................Oh no no no, you'll have to watch the movie to earn that thrill.This movie isn't anything new in horror, its just some good old fashioned suspense horror at its finest.
