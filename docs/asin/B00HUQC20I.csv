Try some popular movies staring Jet Li and you will see the difference.There was only one thing that provoked my curiosity in the first 10 minutes. It was the question ""Why did the father treat his son that way?"". It turned out to be a good twist but it was completely ruined by bad acting. It's like a bad joke.Save your time and money on this one.",1,"The consequences of the low budget are clearly shown on the quality of the fighting scenes, and the acting.",1403654400,"06 25, 2014",2014,524,"['consequences', 'low', 'budget', 'are', 'clearly', 'shown', 'quality', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'acting.The', 'fighting', 'look', 'fakes', 'laughable.The', 'acting', 'not', 'convincing', 'Try', 'popular', 'movies', 'staring', 'Jet', 'Li', 'will', 'see', 'difference.There', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'provoked', 'curiosity', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'was', 'question', 'Why', 'did', 'father', 'treat', 'son', 'way', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'twist', 'was', 'completely', 'ruined', 'bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'joke.Save', 'time', 'money', 'one']",Warrior Assassin Digital

He teams up with one army then ends up in the army he is battling...In spite of all the fighting, the film bored me. The first thing you will notice in the 1970s style dubbing. The voices were terrible and the &#34;whack-whack&#34; every time two body parts hit is old and silly...but I guess it has to be there because it has always been there.Some minor anti-gravity fighting and 9 minutes from the end our hero who is a master fighter is training in a different fight form. One guy fights with a half dozen arrows through his lungs. In one chase scene it suddenly goes from night to day. A person gets shot in the back with an arrow and then has dried blood at the mouth. Three guys fight an army...one fighter at a time. You get the idea.This film is a throw back. 2 stars is generous.",2,YOU ARE MY NEMESIS,1397260800,"04 12, 2014",2014,892,"['young', 'man', 'avenge', 'death', 'father', 'few', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'get', 'killed', 'way', 'up', 'one', 'army', 'then', 'up', 'army', 'battling', 'spite', 'fighting', 'film', 'bored', 'first', 'thing', 'will', 'notice', '1970s', 'style', 'dubbing', 'voices', 'were', 'terrible', '34', 'whack-whack', '34', 'time', 'two', 'body', 'parts', 'hit', 'old', 'silly', 'guess', 'be', 'there', 'always', 'been', 'there.Some', 'minor', 'anti-gravity', 'fighting', '9', 'minutes', 'end', 'hero', 'who', 'master', 'fighter', 'training', 'different', 'fight', 'form', 'One', 'guy', 'fights', 'half', 'dozen', 'arrows', 'lungs', 'one', 'chase', 'scene', 'suddenly', 'night', 'day', 'person', 'shot', 'back', 'arrow', 'then', 'dried', 'blood', 'mouth', 'Three', 'guys', 'fight', 'army', 'one', 'fighter', 'time', 'get', 'idea.This', 'film', 'throw', 'back', '2', 'stars', 'generous']",Warrior Assassin Digital
