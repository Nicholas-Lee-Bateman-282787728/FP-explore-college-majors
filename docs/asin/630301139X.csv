350392,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,630301139X,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","The plot may be formulaic and some of the acting may be mediocre and some of the dialog may be a tad cringe worthy and the overall film may end up being schmaltzy but `Golden Boy' has so much heart I couldn't help falling in love with it.The film tells the story of a young violinist named Joe who has a dream of becoming a prize fighter.  When he injures a professional boxer he gets his chance to take his place in a fight, and soon he becomes a sensation.  His father is disgruntled over his son's decision to chuck aside his talent for such a brutal profession, but Joe's manager Tom Moody couldn't be more pleased, that is until Joe starts having doubts.  When Tom sends his mistress, Lorna, to convince Joe of the course he should take, things get complicated.The romantic aspect of the film seems clich&eacute;d and a tad forced, but the dramatic tensions between Joe and his father are splendidly constructed.  The chemistry between Stanwyck and Holden helps with the romantic subplot, but even their undeniable charm can't really add much weight to their `love'.  I also found the boxing match at the films conclusion to be rushed and laughably edited.  Despite that though, I really like this film a lot.  For me, it all boils down to one thing really:Lee J. Cobb.At just twenty-eight years old, Cobb aged himself almost double his actual age to play William Holden's father with stunning results.  With every silent stare, Cobb permeates the scene with genuine emotion.  Not only was his Italian/American accent legitimate, but his understanding of the character was spot on.  There is nothing false here, no emotion lacking in his complete transformation.  It is a beautiful performance that deserves more recognition.  Stanwyck is also beautifully used here, exuding a rich sense of masked sentiment as she hardens herself before Holden.  Holden (an actor I have always liked very much) is pretty good here.  He certainly gets better as the film presses on, relaxing into his charm and tapping into a real emotional center.I found Adolphe Menjou, Joseph Calleia, Sam Levene and Edward Brophy to be painful caricatures who failed to really uncover the reality of their characters.Depsite how it sounds, there is more to praise here than just Cobb's performance.  The texture of the film is fresh and exciting, and it really has gusto.  The development of the central characters is strong, even if it doesn't always stack up as neatly as you'd want it.  Like I said, the romance seemed a little `obvious', but the development of Lorna and Joe as characters was pretty authentic.  The pacing is nice and brisk, but it never feels too lightweight, especially considering the themes presented.  While I found some of the scripting to be dated and at times a tad overdone (I really hated Siggie's character) I also felt an earnestness that helped me forgive my issues with it.Like I said, there is heart here.  It may not all come together as one would like, but in the end I'm pretty positive you'll be one over by this golden boy!",4,Nearly a KO...,1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,3039,"['plot', 'may', 'be', 'formulaic', 'acting', 'may', 'be', 'mediocre', 'dialog', 'may', 'be', 'tad', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'overall', 'film', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'schmaltzy', 'Golden', 'Boy', 'so', 'much', 'heart', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'falling', 'love', 'it.The', 'film', 'story', 'young', 'violinist', 'named', 'Joe', 'who', 'dream', 'becoming', 'prize', 'fighter', 'When', 'professional', 'boxer', 'chance', 'take', 'place', 'fight', 'soon', 'sensation', 'father', 'disgruntled', 'son', 'decision', 'chuck', 'aside', 'talent', 'brutal', 'profession', 'Joe', 'manager', 'Tom', 'Moody', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'pleased', 'Joe', 'having', 'doubts', 'When', 'Tom', 'mistress', 'Lorna', 'convince', 'Joe', 'course', 'should', 'take', 'things', 'get', 'complicated.The', 'romantic', 'aspect', 'film', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'tad', 'forced', 'dramatic', 'tensions', 'Joe', 'father', 'are', 'splendidly', 'constructed', 'chemistry', 'Stanwyck', 'Holden', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'even', 'undeniable', 'charm', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'much', 'weight', 'love', 'also', 'found', 'boxing', 'match', 'films', 'conclusion', 'be', 'rushed', 'laughably', 'edited', 'really', 'film', 'lot', 'down', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'Lee', 'J.', 'Cobb.At', 'just', 'twenty-eight', 'years', 'old', 'Cobb', 'aged', 'almost', 'double', 'actual', 'age', 'play', 'William', 'Holden', 'father', 'stunning', 'results', 'silent', 'stare', 'Cobb', 'scene', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'Italian/American', 'accent', 'legitimate', 'understanding', 'character', 'was', 'spot', 'nothing', 'false', 'here', 'emotion', 'lacking', 'complete', 'transformation', 'beautiful', 'performance', 'more', 'recognition', 'Stanwyck', 'also', 'beautifully', 'used', 'here', 'exuding', 'rich', 'sense', 'masked', 'sentiment', 'Holden', 'Holden', 'actor', 'have', 'always', 'liked', 'very', 'much', 'pretty', 'good', 'here', 'certainly', 'better', 'film', 'presses', 'relaxing', 'charm', 'tapping', 'real', 'emotional', 'center.I', 'found', 'Adolphe', 'Menjou', 'Joseph', 'Calleia', 'Sam', 'Levene', 'Edward', 'Brophy', 'be', 'painful', 'caricatures', 'who', 'failed', 'really', 'uncover', 'reality', 'characters.Depsite', 'how', 'more', 'praise', 'here', 'just', 'Cobb', 'performance', 'texture', 'film', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'really', 'gusto', 'development', 'central', 'characters', 'strong', 'even', ""n't"", 'always', 'stack', 'up', 'as', 'neatly', ""'d"", 'want', 'said', 'romance', 'seemed', 'little', 'obvious', 'development', 'Lorna', 'Joe', 'characters', 'was', 'pretty', 'authentic', 'pacing', 'nice', 'brisk', 'never', 'too', 'lightweight', 'especially', 'considering', 'themes', 'presented', 'found', 'scripting', 'be', 'dated', 'times', 'tad', 'overdone', 'really', 'hated', 'Siggie', 'character', 'also', 'felt', 'earnestness', 'helped', 'forgive', 'issues', 'it.Like', 'said', 'heart', 'here', 'may', 'not', 'come', 'together', 'one', 'would', 'like', 'end', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'positive', ""'ll"", 'be', 'one', 'golden', 'boy']",N/A

Tracking on this 1985 tape (on my machine) is remarkably stable.In Clifford Odets' original 1937 production, boxer Joe Bonaparte was played by Luther Adler, Lorna Moon by Frances Farmer, racketeer Eddie Fusilli by Elia Kazan and next-door neighbor Mr. Karp by Lee J. Cobb (who in the film is Joe's father). Other stage actors: John Garfield, Howard Da Silva and Karl Malden.Rouben Mamoulian's film version has 21-year-old Bill Holden in his first credited role. Bill was almost fired early on because of mediocre work but Barbara Stanwyck intervened. Success here established him as a star and gave Holden the nickname 'Golden Boy.'Among the uncrediteds:James 'Cannonball' Green as MSG opponent 'Chocolate Drop' also cameoed inROCKY IV(1985).Dorothy Comingore (spectator). A refusal to state party affiliation to the House Un-American Activities Committee ended her career in 1951. Dorothy's most famous role: the alcoholic second wife ofCITIZEN KANE(1941).Heavyweight boxer Tommy Garland. His 65th and last fight occurred around the time this production began shooting.Robert Sterling (elevator boy) was ghostly George Kirby onTV's TOPPER.Syd Saylor (ringsider next to Pa) was comic sidekick in dozens of westerns and the 2nd Bozo the Clown on L.A.'s KTTV Ch. 11.Cy Schindell (fighter), villain in 35Three Stooges comedies. He died in 1948 of complications from jungle rot contracted while serving in WWII.Lee Phelps (ring announcer) had primarily bit parts in 625 films between 1917 and '51, including a bartender inGONE WITH THE WIND(1939).From seven decades distance, the clich&eacute;d plot of 'Golden Boy"" and some of its dialogue go beyond melodrama, landing squarely in the corn bin. Joe Bonaparte, a first generation Italian-American, is torn between his love of music and an urgency to ""be"" somebody and to make big money. Joe abandons the violin to become a boxer but immediately regrets the decision, and not just because he's disappointed his papa. An unscrupulous promoter and manipulative girlfriend keep Joe in the ring, and when a gangster buys his contract and schedules a Madison Square Garden bout, it leads to tragedy. (This final boxing sequence is the film's highlight.)Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(6.8) Golden Boy (1939) - Bill Holden/Barbara Stanwyck/Adolphe Menjou/Lee J.

Barbara Stanwyck plays a hard-boiled tough lady who turns out to have a soft spot - much like in 1941's ""Meet John Doe"" - brought out by Holden's Joe Bonaparte. She is torn between loyalty to Menjou's Tom Moody and the fact that she is drawn to Holden's Bonaparte. And Adolphe Menjou - what can I say? He almost always improves any picture he's in, and I can't seem to dislike him even when he plays the cad. It is a good film full of great performances, raw emotion, and wonderful cinematography, but it is not well remembered because of its year of release - 1939. That was the year of Gone with the Wind, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and The Wizard of Oz. However, it did do quite well at the box office.The bonus materials include three vintage short subjects: The Kangaroo Kid, a 1938 color cartoon spoof of Golden Boy; the 1940 two-reeler Pleased To Mitt You, one of the ""Glove Slingers"" series of comedy shorts with Shemp Howard (of The Three Stooges); and the August 1, 1930 edition of Screen Snapshots, which features a 23-year-old Stanwyck being taught to play golf by fellow actor Ricardo Cortez.  The DVD also contains her very first dramatic TV appearance: the western drama Sudden Silence, a 1956 episode of ""Ford Television Theatre"" that has been unseen for 50 years. The source of information on these extras was a press release issued when the DVD was announced. It is good to see Sony giving its classics some consideration for a change and not just dumping an old classic film on a disc with no extras in order to pump up the release of a usually inferior remake.

I like pictures with boxing ring fights and this is a good one. The performances of Barbara Stanwyck, Wm Holden & Adolphe Menjou are excellent. So-called HD mastering is listed on the slick and this is a superb production both in picture & sound. Many Columbia features and serials from this period, generally, suffer from poor elements, much of which had been shipped to the Library of Congress long ago. Sound elements have been lost in part on some serial reels, for example, and have been replaced by new voices using original script dialogue but this is usually to noticeable in all respects.

Anything starring Barbara Stanwyck is worth seeing; in this movie, Stanwyck's jaded toughness and intelligence make her likeable, vulnerable (has any other actress ever been able to portray toughness and vulnerability at the same time, the way she did?), and fascinating to watch. William Holden is obviously inexperienced here, but there are moments during this film when you catch a glimpse of his future greatness and his underlying ability...even though Stanwyck was 11 years older than Holden, their love story is always believeable. Stanwyck had an ageless quality about her, and about her appearance...you never counted the years, you were so blown away by her acting brilliance.

Lifelong friends since this 1939 film, Bill Holden always gave credit to Stanwyck for helping him with his rather difficult role of Joe Bonaparte, the Golden Boy of the title. Very green as an actor, Holden had a tough battle to succeed in the role; Stanwyck spent time giving him acting advice(she had acted in films a dozen years already) and her coaching was in no small part of an amazing performance coming from such a novice. Barbara is in typical excellent form; her Lorna Moon is blunt and without illusions (she usually was, wasn't she?) - clearly a woman who ""knows the score"". Much of the film seems oversimplified today with unneccesary sentiment with Lee J. Cobb in a rather overwrought performance as Joe's ""You-a-gooda-boy"" Italian pop. However, the picture retains solid virtues in the authentic fight scenes and the ""real"" performances of three pros: Stanwyck, Menjou and Calleia. In a year too rich with fabulous movies (It's highly doubtful that 1939 will EVER be matched again for the number of superlative movies released in a single year) Golden Boy did mediocre business. Holden sent Stanwyck a single red rose on the anniversary of G.B.'s release date annually for the rest of his life-he felt that indebted to her for her immeasureable help.",4,LORNA MOON.,996537600,"07 31, 2001",2001,1332,"['young', 'man', 'torn', 'being', 'violinist', 'prizefighter', 'Lifelong', '1939', 'film', 'Bill', 'Holden', 'always', 'gave', 'credit', 'Stanwyck', 'helping', 'rather', 'difficult', 'role', 'Joe', 'Bonaparte', 'Golden', 'Boy', 'title', 'Very', 'green', 'actor', 'Holden', 'had', 'tough', 'battle', 'succeed', 'role', 'Stanwyck', 'spent', 'time', 'giving', 'acting', 'advice', 'had', 'acted', 'films', 'dozen', 'years', 'already', 'coaching', 'was', 'small', 'part', 'amazing', 'performance', 'coming', 'novice', 'Barbara', 'typical', 'excellent', 'form', 'Lorna', 'Moon', 'blunt', 'illusions', 'usually', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'clearly', 'woman', 'who', 'score', 'Much', 'film', 'oversimplified', 'today', 'unneccesary', 'sentiment', 'Lee', 'J.', 'Cobb', 'rather', 'overwrought', 'performance', 'Joe', 'You-a-gooda-boy', 'Italian', 'pop', 'However', 'picture', 'solid', 'virtues', 'authentic', 'fight', 'scenes', 'real', 'performances', 'three', 'pros', 'Stanwyck', 'Menjou', 'Calleia', 'year', 'too', 'rich', 'fabulous', 'movies', 'highly', 'doubtful', '1939', 'will', 'EVER', 'be', 'matched', 'again', 'number', 'superlative', 'movies', 'released', 'single', 'year', 'Golden', 'Boy', 'did', 'mediocre', 'business', 'Holden', 'sent', 'Stanwyck', 'single', 'red', 'rose', 'anniversary', 'G.B', 'release', 'date', 'annually', 'rest', 'life-he', 'felt', 'indebted', 'immeasureable', 'help']",N/A
350406,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,630301139X,Simon Davis,"[24, 25]","Columbia Pictures ""Golden Boy"", released in 1939 retells one of the most famous of ringside stories in the tale of a sensitive boy who loves his violin playing but who because of grinding poverty is forced into the tough and uncompromising world of major league boxing. A major release for 1939 the role of Joe Bonaparte provided a star making break for the young and largely inexperienced William Holden after Columbia was unable to borrow their first choice for the role, Twentieth Century Fox star Tyrone Power. Although the male character is really central to most of the action, ""Golden Boy"", also provided a very important role for Barbara Stanwyck which aided greatly in her climb to top stardom which had been given a major push two years previously with her acclaimed Academy Award nominated performance in ""Stella Dallas"". Accused by some as being now a dated melodrama its underlying theme of the often painful compromises that we often are forced to make in life is still just as timely and the Stanwyck/Holden/Menjou combination works wonderfully in bringing this often used theme with its stock characters to life.""Golden Boy"", had already enjoyed great success on Broadway when Columbia Pictures bought the rights and it offered a plum lead role to any young actor. We first see Joe (William Holden), as a studious young man in a poor and largely Italian neighbourhood of New York. Preferring to play his violin to earning a living the traditional way Joe is encouraged by his father (Lee J. Cobb)), who wants to see his son perfect his craft. Joe however begins to see that his life will never change unless he earns real money and despite his father's opposition Joe begins to earn quick money in the boxing ring. Guided by trainer Tom Moody (Adolphe Menjou), Joe begins to blossom as a fighter getting bigger bouts that bring in big money. Joe also makes the acquaintance of Lorna Moon, Tom's girlfriend who is largely taken for granted by him and is someone eager for love. The two quickly form an attraction however Joe's relationship with Tom begins to go sour as Joe feels he is ready for bigger things. In a rage Joe drops Tom as his trainer unaware that Tom is a basically decent individual who cares for him. He falls into the hands of crooked racketeer Eddie Fuseli (Joseph Calleia), who cares nothing about the fighters he ""looks after"", and is involved in many shady dealings. Fuseli gets Joe the big fight he has been waiting for however it ends in tragedy when his opponent is accidently killed in the ring. When Joe sees the man's grief stricken family he begins to question the course he has taken in regards to both his vocation in life and in his feelings for Lorna. The conclusion sees Joe dump Fuseli and return to his great love of music with the ever loyal Lorna by his side.Despite its at times predictable story it's the performances that work the real magic in ""Golden Boy"". William Holden delivers an amazing performance as the curly haired rookie fighter who finds life at the top has its drawbacks. Despite his inexperience Holden really shows the future talent that was in evidence throughout his career and his torment over whether to stay with his great love of violin playing or earn the big money as a boxer is very well handled in this his first important part.  His chemistry with the much more experienced Barbara Stanwyck is electric and there is the well known story of Stanwyck being responsible for guiding the younger actor through the initial stages of production until he found his acting legs thus beginning a lifelong friendship with his leading lady. The Barbara Stanwyck that we perhaps best know from her sterling work during her peak period of the 1940's in classics such as ""The Lady Eve"", and ""Double Indemnity"", was still only being developed here in ""Golden Boy"". As the ""girl"", of Fight trainer Tom Moody Stanwyck already shows that no nonsense independent streak in her playing of Lorna Moon that would be further developed in the succeeding years in her many important roles.  Stanwyck always gave her all in films and here in ""Golden Boy"", she succeeds in turning what could have been a window dressing role into an important character that you do very quickly begin to care about. Gifted actor Adolphe Menjou, who gave countless great performances over the years delivers another one here in the difficult role of the Boxing Trainer who develops Joe as a fighter only to see him take his girl at the finale. He turns a possibly thankless role into one of great interest with just the right elements of toughness with that hint of vulnerability that makes his character such an intersting one. Joseph Calleia also does most interesting work as crooked promoter Eddie Fuseli who almost wrecks Joe's life and much of the real tension in the story comes from his performance. The scenes where Joe accidently kills his black opponent in the ring are really emotionally charged and Eddie Fuseli's complete indifference to the man's death and Joe's need for support during this time are some of the most powerful moments in the story. Whether you are a boxing fan or not the ringside action is first rate in ""Golden Boy"", and William Holden shows a professional understanding of the art of boxing and the correct movements like he actually was trained as one.""Golden Boy"", might be viewed as romantic melodrama by some but the story manages to get across the harsh reality of life in the boxing ring and the toll it takes on individuals not strong enough to cope with it very well. The film for me is memorable for the birth of the legendary career of William Holden and the further development of Barbara Stanwyck's towards total stardom. Not being a boxing fan it's the performances and strong attempts at realism that make this film stand out for me. It is in my belief one of Hollywood's better forays into a boxing themed story. For a slice of gritty entertainment courtesy of Columbia Pictures I highly recommend their 1939 effort ""Golden Boy"", starring Barbara Stanwyck and William Holden.",4,Classic Boxing Story With A

A-list production values it may have, but boy, is it bad.Clifford Odets may have fashioned himself as a champion of the working man, but his patronising portrayal of violinist-boxer William Holden's immigrant family makes a Chico Marx routine look like Arthur Miller by comparison. No clich&eacute; is left unturned, be it Lee J. Cobb's Gepetto-like Ay-a-Tallyana papa, the loveable wife-beating brother-in-law (she loves it really: no, she really DOES) or Holden's Golden Boy playing Brahms' Cradle Song on the violin - you'll be rooting for him to bust his hand so he can never play the violin again.

It's not just that, terrifying but true, he looks like a very young Tom Hanks but his acting is clumsy, his voice weak and he occasionally looks awkward and desperately unsure of how to act to camera: hard to believe that you're watching the first steps of a future screen great here - indeed, just about the only line to ring true is when Stanwyck tells him ""I'll see you in 1966.
