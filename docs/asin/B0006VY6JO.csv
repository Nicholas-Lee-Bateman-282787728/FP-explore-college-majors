But be warned, as others have stated, this is hard work. Warrior Workout was my 5th DVD from Ravi and Ana, and I loved them so much, and they were becoming such a big part of my workout routine, that I wanted to go for something a little harder, but man did I underestimate. This DVD starts off innocently enough, with a warmup that's something of an amped up version of the first half of Begginers and Beyond, before moving into some more strenuous stretches, transformed into a cardio workout.I have to admit, the first time I tried it, I didn't even make it through the whole workout. Poses I thought I had more or less mastered (ok maybe not mastered, but got the hang of) in Ultimate Stretch, were making me fall over. My legs were shaking, I was getting hungry, trying really hard not to curse Ana out, and I decided to get better control over my poses and try again. And I am so happy I did. This workout is tough, for reasons I can't even really explain, but it is so so worth it. So if you're looking for your first kundalini yoga DVD, even if you are good at other kinds of yoga, it is probably better to start somewhere else, like Ultimate Stretch or Beginners and Beyond.A must have, I think, but not a first-buy.",5,"Deeply Rewarding, requires practice",1380672000,"10 2, 2013",2013,1355,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'workout', 'can', 'kick', 'butt', 'leave', 'peaceful', 'calm', 'yoga', 'session', 'look', 'further', 'be', 'warned', 'others', 'have', 'stated', 'hard', 'work', 'Warrior', 'Workout', 'was', '5th', 'DVD', 'Ravi', 'Ana', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'were', 'becoming', 'big', 'part', 'workout', 'routine', 'wanted', 'go', 'something', 'little', 'harder', 'man', 'did', 'underestimate', 'DVD', 'off', 'innocently', 'enough', 'warmup', 'something', 'amped', 'up', 'version', 'first', 'half', 'Begginers', 'Beyond', 'moving', 'more', 'strenuous', 'stretches', 'transformed', 'cardio', 'have', 'admit', 'first', 'time', 'tried', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'whole', 'workout', 'thought', 'had', 'more', 'less', 'mastered', 'ok', 'maybe', 'not', 'mastered', 'got', 'hang', 'Ultimate', 'Stretch', 'were', 'making', 'fall', 'legs', 'were', 'shaking', 'was', 'getting', 'hungry', 'trying', 'really', 'hard', 'not', 'curse', 'Ana', 'decided', 'get', 'better', 'control', 'poses', 'try', 'again', 'am', 'so', 'happy', 'did', 'workout', 'tough', 'reasons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'explain', 'so', 'so', 'worth', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'first', 'kundalini', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'even', 'are', 'good', 'other', 'kinds', 'yoga', 'probably', 'better', 'start', 'somewhere', 'else', 'Ultimate', 'Stretch', 'Beginners', 'Beyond.A', 'must', 'have', 'think', 'not', 'first-buy']",Warrior Workout: Kundalini Yoga

On top of that, I'm not one of those people who's just blessed with good flexibility. In fact, I'm very inflexible. I've been doing the Ultimate Stretch DVD for about a week and could more or less do all the poses. I couldn't go as far into the stretch as Ana, but I could do it, so I figured I'd try a different DVD. The Warrior Workout is very good and definitely gets your heart going. I felt like I got an awesome workout with this DVD. The only reason I knocked a star off of the rating is because this DVD is NOT for beginners. On just about every pose, I had to make a modification or stop earlier than Ana. I still loved the workout and while I'm going to put this DVD on hold for now, I'm really looking forward to the day I can do the entire DVD.

I'm assuming it was tough for me because it targeted areas I've been neglecting in other yoga routines (upper body), and because I needed the detox. After finishing I feel lighter and slightly sore, but invigorated.This disc has a great balance of the kundalini yoga warmups that I have come to adore, some more traditional hatha yoga poses (down dog into up dog, repeated a few times- OW, my arms!), detox, and meditation. My only gripe is that I couldn't remember the words to the meditation song by the time they were removed from the screen (pausing the disc and jotting them down is my solution, although I had to make sure to print them big enough so as not to distract myself by having to squint).Ana and Ravi singlehandedly turned me on to kundalini yoga, and my health and mental well-being have really benefited. I lost weight and have toned up! My skin has much more of a glow to it too.

875125,A1QWSD0YWW9OU9,B0006VY6JO,Paresh Shah,"[2, 2]","I believe this is the #1 Kundalini DVD out there.  I discovered this Kundalini Yoga Series by Ana Brett and Ravi Singh on Amazon about 2 years ago and it is incredible.  I have been doing casual yoga of various sorts here and there (Hatha, Kripalu, etc.) over the years but this series by Ana Brett and Ravi Singh fundamentally changed my approach to wellness, fitness,  personal growth and outlook on life.  I was totally new to Kundalini Yoga and, frankly, a but skeptical about it since it has some ""unusual"" moves and poses and chanting compared to other forms of exercise and Yoga I have done at the gym and via DVDs.  Now I see the power of Kundalini via Ana and Ravi ""technology"" that integrates physicality, mindfulness, and spirit.  It is not easy at first - but that is the point.  You do what you can, dot judge yourself and you reap massive benefits.  I progressed quite rapidly from things I felt were impossible but worth trying to not so hard to challenging to ""not hard any more"".  I feel GREAT every single time I complete a DVD - -my mood, my body, my creativity, my stress, my mind clarity, my stamina, etc.  Its truly amazing.  The key to reaping these benefits is to not get caught up in saying ""this is weird"" but to say ""just try it and see how you feel"".  Incredibly fit and wise people did this type of yoga and meditation hundreds and thousands of years ago as a regular regime but Western society has somehow made it non-traditional and inaccessible.  Many other types of Yoga focus too much on the body and physicality and don't see the mind, body, spirit interconnection like Ravi and Ana.  Ravi and Ana make it so accessible - combining direction on how to do the poses and breathwork and sounds (mantras) that vibrate your body to heal it, strengthen it and give new clarity.  Ana demonstrates the poses (don't be intimidated by how easy she makes things look - just do your best is what I found) and Ravi and Ana explain the physiological basis of how each pose affects your glands, nervous system, muscular system. Brain and energy and spirit.  Ravi has amazing poetry sprinkled in to make it just a beautiful relaxing experience (even though its quite physical!).  The production is very professionally done -- different angles, alternatives if you have certain issues or challenges, music editing, pacing, etc.  I totally recommend any of Ana Brett and Ravi Singh's DVD's to anyone whether you do Yoga already or not.  It can truly take your fitness to another level along with your outlook on life.

I'm still rating it a five though because I believe I'll love it when I'm advanced enough to do it.So, what was so difficult.  To start off I'm overweight FYI, and while not inflexible I'm no yoga buff, gymnast or dancer.  You have to hold this back bend what seems like forever and rotate in and out of it for example.  There are down dogs and they are so slow.  Holy cow.  And unlike my other two dvd's from Ana I have; Chakras, and house call, not much meditation inbetween the moves.  This one is more intense so if holding some gumby like positions is no problem for you and breath of fire simultaneously is your cup of tea, than drink up.As for me, I'm keeping the DVD as something to work up to. An, ""I have arrived to the top of the yoga mountain DVD.""  Those backbends were such a killer, unbelievable.  My triceps were simply screaming.  Pilates was much easier than this by the way.For those who'd like a comparison the warrior is a ten in effort compared to chakras (3) and house calls (2).

Now I do yoga instead for 6 days. I do mostly Ana Brett & Ravi Singh yoga workouts.  I really like their type of yoga because it feels very aerobic. It is a mild form of cardio that feels much healthier to my body then all that hard stepping up and down and running that I had been doing  I have been amazed to see I have finally started losing weight and actually seeing some muscles in my arms legs, back and stomach - all former problem areas.The only other thing I do, which is something I have always done,  is walking at a fairly good pace.
