166919,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,0800196333,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[1, 1]","""The Whole Wide World"" is a stunning, quiet biopic about Robert E. Howard's (The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian: The Original Adventures of the Greatest Sword and Sorcery Hero of All Time!) life and his brief romance with schoolteacher Novalyne Price in rural Texas. People tend to associate Howard with the sword-and-sandal epics of the barbarian Conan, but this story shows his tragic, isolated life. Howard was reclusive. It's no wonder Novalyne, in her memoir, described him asOne Who Walked Alone: Robert E. Howard the Final YearsVincent D'Onofrio (Full Metal Jacket [HD],The Cell) is perfect as Howard, in all his tragedy&pathos.; In real life, Howard wasn't exactly a sympathetic guy... but D'Onofrio shows how he was a troubled soul. In an early role, Renee Zellweger is superb as Novalyne. We see her struggling to understand Howard.""Whole Wide World"" isn't a conventional romance. Robert Howard wrote of Conan's lusty conquests of bosomy women, but his romance with Novalyne was chaste. It's notable that the couple has more quarrels than kisses. They fight over the subjects of his writing, the role of women, violence&sex; in literature. Novalyne longs for Howard to come out of his seclusion&be; part of the community. Howard longs for solitude. The most powerful scenes are of Howard, out on the Texas plains, re-enacting scenes from his pulp novels. We see his tremendous creativity.... and loneliness. We also see his dysfunctional relationship with his mother Hester (Ann Wedgeworth) Howard acts a surrogate husband of sorts-despite the fact his father is a doctor. He spoon feeds her medicine, bathes her. One can see how his relationship with his mother colored his relationships with women. Unlike most romantic movies, most of this movie is spent with dialogues about writing&the; creative process. Howard excitedly tells Novalyne of his creations of ""Devil of Iron"" and ""Red Nails."" We hear him passionately reading from his ""A Witch is Born"" as he writes it. Tragically, it mirrors his downward spiral. Howard&Novalyne; end up parting ways, with Howard trapped in his smaller world. As his mother lay dying, Howard was devastated. He&his; mother died 8 hours apart, with him dying from his own hand.""Whole Wide World"" is a superb biopic of a famous pulp fiction writer and his tragic life.",5,He Who Walks Alone,1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,2311,"['Whole', 'Wide', 'World', 'stunning', 'quiet', 'biopic', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Howard', 'Coming', 'Conan', 'Cimmerian', 'Original', 'Adventures', 'Greatest', 'Sword', 'Sorcery', 'Hero', 'All', 'Time', 'life', 'brief', 'romance', 'schoolteacher', 'Novalyne', 'Price', 'rural', 'Texas', 'People', 'tend', 'associate', 'Howard', 'sword-and-sandal', 'epics', 'barbarian', 'Conan', 'story', 'tragic', 'isolated', 'life', 'Howard', 'was', 'reclusive', 'wonder', 'Novalyne', 'memoir', 'described', 'asOne', 'Who', 'Walked', 'Alone', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Howard', 'Final', 'YearsVincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', '[', 'HD', ']', 'Cell', 'perfect', 'Howard', 'tragedy', 'pathos', 'real', 'life', 'Howard', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'sympathetic', 'guy', ""D'Onofrio"", 'how', 'was', 'troubled', 'soul', 'early', 'role', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'superb', 'Novalyne', 'see', 'struggling', 'understand', 'Howard', 'Whole', 'Wide', 'World', ""n't"", 'conventional', 'romance', 'Robert', 'Howard', 'wrote', 'Conan', 'lusty', 'conquests', 'bosomy', 'women', 'romance', 'Novalyne', 'was', 'chaste', 'notable', 'couple', 'more', 'quarrels', 'kisses', 'fight', 'subjects', 'writing', 'role', 'women', 'violence', 'sex', 'literature', 'Novalyne', 'longs', 'Howard', 'come', 'seclusion', 'be', 'part', 'community', 'Howard', 'solitude', 'most', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'are', 'Howard', 'Texas', 'plains', 're-enacting', 'scenes', 'pulp', 'novels', 'see', 'tremendous', 'creativity', 'loneliness', 'also', 'see', 'dysfunctional', 'relationship', 'mother', 'Hester', 'Ann', 'Wedgeworth', 'Howard', 'surrogate', 'husband', 'sorts-despite', 'fact', 'father', 'doctor', 'spoon', 'feeds', 'medicine', 'One', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'relationship', 'mother', 'colored', 'relationships', 'women', 'most', 'romantic', 'movies', 'most', 'movie', 'spent', 'dialogues', 'writing', 'creative', 'process', 'Howard', 'excitedly', 'Novalyne', 'creations', 'Devil', 'Iron', 'Red', 'Nails', 'hear', 'passionately', 'reading', 'A', 'Witch', 'Born', 'Tragically', 'downward', 'spiral', 'Howard', 'Novalyne', 'end', 'up', 'parting', 'ways', 'Howard', 'trapped', 'smaller', 'world', 'mother', 'lay', 'dying', 'Howard', 'was', 'devastated', 'died', '8', 'hours', 'apart', 'dying', 'own', 'hand', 'Whole', 'Wide', 'World', 'superb', 'biopic', 'famous', 'pulp', 'fiction', 'writer', 'tragic', 'life']",N/A

But eventually I was enthralled and couldn't stop watching. It's almost like a train wreck when you just can't look away. The end is the clincher.I knew nothing about the story but the movie drove me to find out more. It's based on a true story. The woman waited until she was in her 70's to write about this. The man is indeed the author of the Conan the Barbarian stories. Just knowing this little bit made the story that much better to me.I found D'Onofrio irritating at times so maybe that's why everyone else thinks he acted it so well.

In the past three days I have watched this movie 4 times. I have never done that with any movie in my entire life. This is an amazing portrayal of two people who love each other and are unable to fulfill thier love for each other because of the ill health of Howards mother and the fact that Howard is socially inept and unable to let Novalyne close to him.The musical score is masterful and brings out the emotion of the story beautifully.This story was heartbreaking. I cried through it every time I viewed it. It touched off emotions within me that I didn't know were there. Maybe not for everyone but it really struck a chord within me.

166924,A3GVELJACSE24Z,0800196333,CT,"[54, 54]","This film should be used as example of independent filmmaking at its finest.  Made on a shoestring budget with then unknown actors, director Dan Ireland creates a film that is by turns sweeping, intimate, funny and tragic.  He takes the viewers into 1930s smalltown Texas and makes you feel like you are there -- you can see how he trusts his actors to portray their characters, and they in turn don't disappointVincent D'Onofrio and Renee Zellweger both give unique and memorable performances in this haunting love story. One never feels that they are &quot;acting&quot;, even for a minute. One senses the tragedy in the relationship between pulp fiction writer Bob Howard and teacher Novalyne Price, but also the sweetness that led her to write the memoir on which this film was based, many years later.View this film, it will not disappoint.  I think it is one of the top ten films I've ever seen. It's a crime that it was not more widely released, or recognized by the Academy Awards.  Both actors were deserving of Best Actor/Actress recognition for their work, but I guess small non-moneymaking films don't stand much of a chance in that arena!

166925,A2I2DE1DJUVQOO,0800196333,DarthRad,"[3, 4]","Because of all the complaints about the apparently shortened U.S. version of this movie, I made a special effort to get the original Canadian version of the DVD through an Amazon Marketplace seller - this version of the DVD is marked as being 111 minutes long on the DVD back cover (that's also the stated length of the original movie on Imdb.com).  But, when I timed this DVD out on my computer, it is only 106 min. long.To add to the confusion, the (Canadian) Amazon.ca site now lists three versions of this DVD, an ""import"" version that appears to be the U.S. version, the original Canadian version (February 25, 2003 release date), and a new DVD (Canadian only?) with a release date of  October 19, 2004.  However, there is no further information on the website as to what the technical differences are between these DVDs, and the folks at Amazon.ca had no further information to give out when I contacted them by e-mail.  Hey guys, you really need to sort this out!Even more confusing, the British Amazon.co.uk site lists only an import version of this DVD, which has the same release date and ASIN number as the U.S. DVD, but is listed as 106 min long, not 93 min.  Somebody has made a mistake here.My copy of this Canadian DVD (Feb. 25, 2003 version) is not a great transfer (contrary to an earlier post by the director himself, Dan Ireland on January 11, 2003 posted on the VHS version of this movie) - the opening and ending credits and much of the movie appear to be either slightly out of focus or heavily compressed, or both; and the edges of the screen can be seen creeping into the corners on a number of occasions.  There are also occasional strange, chopping artifacts -  e.g., at the 1 hour 15 min. mark, the top edge of the picture suddenly separates and duplicates - this is noticeable because it chops the character Truett Vinson's head into two parts.  This Canadian version also does not have the added bonus commentary track by the director and actors.Having never seen the original theatrical release or the other DVD versions, I have no clue what has been left in and what has been cut out from this version.  An earlier post (Sept. 29, 2003) about a laserdisk version of this movie mentioned a couple of scenes - the lightning strike, a discussion of ancestral memories, which I did not see in this DVD.  The scene where Howard's mother tells him that HP Lovecraft wanted his address to write to him is in this version.  The latter parts of the movie seem a bit choppy and disjointed, as if some interconnecting scenes were cut out.So it is likely that my  Canadian version, although longer than the U.S. version, is still not the full version.Whatever, this is still a GREAT movie with outstanding performances by a number of people.  A lot has been said already about the tragic and yet wonderful story line and the terrific acting, so I won't repeat all of that.  A few additional comments that haven't been made:1. Robert E. Howard would definitely fit into the category of Asperger's Syndrome (utterly inept at social conventions, but often brilliant in a very focused area, thought to be a form of autism).  Read up about Asperger's - you will find it hard to disagree.  So, it wasn't just having to live in Cross Plains, Texas back in the early 1900's that did him in.2. The movie made it seem that it was a combination of the rejection by Novalyne Price and the impending death of his mother that drove Robert Howard to suicide.  One will never know of course, just how much Robert Howard loved Novalyne Price.  What is clear is that Novalyne Price was attracted both physically by this large, powerfully built man, as well as by his brilliant mind and poetic sensibilities.  But in the end, she wanted, like so many conventional girls do want, a stable husband, a social life, somebody who would not be so blunt,  direct, and completely lacking in social graces.3. The attachment between Robert Howard and his mother is more understandable if one realizes that people with Asperger's often have a terrible time growing up as children and young adults.  No doubt she had to bail him out of many social jams and comfort him frequently.  No doubt she was the only person in the world who understood him and accepted him as he was (since his own father did not understand him).  It's possible that his mother may have also had a degree of Asperger's, given the socially withdrawn way that she is portrayed in the film.  The tragedy of this  story is that it appeared that Robert E. Howard was looking to transfer some of that love and affection to another woman, but was unable to find that love.  The tragedy of Novalyne Price is undoubtedly the regrets that she must have had about her brief love for this troubled, brilliant young man.",5,"Great movie!

Middle-of-nowhere Texas would be the last place where I'd have thought Conan to be created, much less the eccentric creator having a strong relationship with a fairly conservative girl. Now, this movie is based off the book One Who Walked Alone. I haven't found it yet but I'd like to read it. But while I'm waiting for the book to pop up someday, this movie is enough. I don't normally like romance-type movies, but I REALLY like this one. The characters are so INTERESTING and they act their parts SO well. I especially like Robert E. Howard's monologue about &quot;Who's Conan?&quot; Every time I watch that, Conan yarns flit through my head. In fact, this was the movie that got me hooked on Robert E. Howard's works, then H.P. Lovecraft, etc. So what is the plot of the movie? Well, it's about a young woman who takes a liking to an eccentric pulp-fiction writer.

The small town Texas depicted here is portrayed and acted as lovingly and gently as the breeze on a Central Texas front porch.  Mr. Ireland's direction is more than up to the task, and the movie's cumulative effect on the viewer is one of complete emotional involvement and investment.Poetic and lovely, honest and true, there are few American films of the last 25 years that can match ""The Whole Wide World.""One shortcoming (and it is an unfortunate and common one):  where are the Black and Mexican people?

166939,A37NODCIL8PP75,0800196333,"Jeannette Belliveau ""Author, Writer, Editor, ...","[15, 15]","Funny that someone would produce a ""chick flick"" based on the relationship of Novalyne Price to author Robert E. Howard, creator of the sci-fi/fantasy character Conan. No doubt someone in Hollywood thought the irony of filming a romantic character study of the man who wrote the classic male-oriented action-thriller stories of the 1930s would be a good way to attract an unlikely mix of female romance fans and fans of the Conan books and comics.Well the ploy worked, as I got my husband (severely allergic to chick flicks) to sit down and watch this one with me. ""You probably won't like this,"" I said, ""but it does show two creative people, one of them is the guy [Robert E. Howard] who wrote the Conan books.""Vincent D'Onofrio plays Robert E. Howard, a man who simultaneously looks sympathetic and psychopathic (his portrayal of Private  Pyle in ""Full Metal Jacket"" is one of film history's creepiest moments). That he actually resembles Howard as a bonus.Timeless beauty Rene Zellweger plays the intelligent Price, a local Texas school teacher who becomes romantically interested in Howard, a recluse that types his stories with extreme intensity in the privacy of his home while taking care of an ailingmother.My favorite scene is the one where where Renee's character is demonstrating how much she appreciates language in its ability to describe the scenery around them.  Robert E. Howard's response boils down to, ""That's great, but what the hell happens?""  and he begins imagining an exciting adolescent heroic fantasy intruding into her peaceful meadow.  The scene almost makes you feel guilty for realizing that there are real reasons why Conan and other pulp fiction characters endure and outsell all but the very best of the more respectable stuff.  The film, as my brother (another Howard fan, who named his dog after Conan) notes, also didn't shy away from the fact that most of the best pulp work was based on insecure power trips written by and for arrested adolescents with real issues.Here is the difficulty Howard fans, such as my husband, who has written reams of what he has written, will have with the film. The story is told from his girlfriend Novalyn's  perspective so a very important aspect of Howard's life, the specifics and depth of his stories,  is largely skimmed over. The film sums up Howard's work by showing Price in a witty scene comparing her breast size with the bosoms of Howard's characters, and by showing the shock of people as he describes or acts out his work in public. There is some attempt at showing his desire to create the deeper more assertive female character Valeria in ""Red Nails"" but it is only a passing mention in conversation.Howard is depicted as resting on the edge of insanity at times, which is believable considering his tragic end. He doesn't just write, he becomes his characters.Price, an aspiring writer herself, hopes to learn from Howard but is put off by his erratic behavior and a more romantic interest in him that wishes he'd write nicer stories with more pleasant sympathetic characters. This void between them prevents the viewers ... or should I say Howard fans from knowing which stories he was working on at what time in the plot.""The Devil in Iron"" is the only one mentioned by name and others are hinted at including a boxing story, ""Queen of the Black Coast,"" and his last masterpiece ""Red Nails,"" which many fans regard as his finest story (or yarn as Robert calls them in the film). As my husband has read all of his books and many different comic adaptations he was able to pick out some of the works from his ramblings behind the typewriter, but his work is treated as a distracting  sideshow  by the film, in spite of the Price character's attempts to be non-judgmental and open-minded about his topics. The real story of the film is a battle between Price and Howard's mother for his attention.This may be an accurate dramatization of Price's feelings but to a Howard fan its a little bit like treating Michaelangelo's David or the Sistine Chapel as incidental in the story of his life.A talented artist will live their work, become their characters, the events will be in their heads almost as if it is reality.

It immediately became one of my very favorites of all time. I had heard of the pulp writer Robert E. Howard only faintly but after aquainting myself with this film had no other choice than to immerse myself in his works and all I could find about the (only brief) life he led. If you're a fan of the eccentric Robert than you will without a doubt be entertained by his true life story and even if you are not very familiar with him, you will no doubt still be moved by this film. It is taken from the novel ""One Who Walked Alone"" by Novalyne Price, the one woman who loved and accepted Robert despite all his 'faults' and mental illness and recorded her time spent with him in her journal. Robert E. Howard was considered a misfit and refused to conform to the ways of society, living mostly in the worlds he created on paper as was what he felt most comfortable with. The film tells of their time spent together as friends and so much more and is definitely one of the most touching love stories ever filmed. Not to mention it has THE BEST kiss scene ever portrayed!!

We took it home. To find out, not that it was worth a lot in money, but worth a lot in our hearts. My husband and I sat to watch this movie together. When it finished we knew how much we were moved.

It was hard to watch this shallow film unfold without shaking my head at the five-star ""consensus"" it achieved here. The movie, to my mind, had potential. The famed creator of Conan the Barbarian finds romantic love. It had the chance to show nuance. To contrast the reality of love with the overblown romantic and sexual themes of the old style pulp fiction world in which all men are savage and strong, and all women are savage, strong, busty, and usually pretty quiet. And, there's no doubt this movie tries. But, these characters, and, more accurately, the portrayals of them, don't live to up to any of that promise. Renee Zellweger is certainly charming in a very subtle way, but her performance lacks emotional nuance so necessary for a drama that aspires to some degree of seriousness -- something which the ending (which I won't give away) necessitates. Vincent D'Onofrio does a little better, but not much. If Robert E. Howard really was this dysfunctional ""momma's boy"" in the way portrayed here, a little more depth would have been helpful.

Finally I got hold of a VHS copy and sat with my wife (and such kids as were interested) and watched it. Impressions: The two principle actors are just about perfect for the roles of Howard and Price. Having been a Howard fan for years, and being familiar with his life's story, I was sceptical that any film would play it straight. But this story seems to not have needed any embellishment to make it more romantic, sad and triumphant. I agree with what one reviewer has already said: that KISS is probably the most passionate I have ever seen in a movie ! And it is important too; because it shows up how hard it is to recapture feelings when things are said (and left unsaid) and love fades away. The timing of their lost love for each other (which was growing by fits and starts first one feeling it, then the other) is what forms Novalyne Price's life-long regret (so I gather from the tone of the story): that had she just said the right things - felt the right things - at the right time, Howard would not have been lost to her. (That constitutes almost a spoiler; and for those who do not know the story I apologize.) But the triumph of the story is also in the ending of it: it has to do with faith and hope.For those who want a real-life romance, this film is perhaps the best I have seen. It is sort of like ""Out of Africa"" in that respect; but I enjoyed it far more, because it is about someone (Howard) that I care about.",4,This is Robert E.

Totally unsympathetic almost until the very end, one has to ask why this movie would interest any but Mr. Howard's fans and why they should tolerate such a shoddy treatment of a truly gifted man.  There's precious little reason to care for either of the two main characters, although Ren&eacute;e Zellweger gives a game performance and shows any depth or dimension of any of the players in front of the camera.  D'Onofrio who gave a riveting performance as the psychotic misfit ""Private Pyle"" in 'Full Metal Jacket', totally ignored Howard's many facets to portray him as a social outcast and raving lunatic.  While I began watching this movie with anxious anticipation knowing that D'Onofrio and Zellweger are top-flight performers, the movie ended mercifully way too late to hope to get 93 of the longest movie watching minutes of my life back.

166953,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0800196333,Reviewer,"[113, 116]","After retiring from teaching, lifelong aspiring writer Novalyne Price wrote her first book at age 76, ""One Who Walked Alone,"" a memoir dedicated to the memory of pulp fiction writer Robert E. Howard, and upon which this film, ""The Whole Wide World,"" directed by Dan Ireland, is based.  The film paints a soul wrenching portrait of a man who was larger than life in the world of his own creation, but who was a socially inept, self-proclaimed ""lummox"" in the real world, who had an unhealthy devotion to his sickly mother and had trouble expressing his true feelings to the woman he obviously loved.  To Novalyne Price-- as well as his legions of devoted readers-- Howard was the greatest pulp writer in the whole wide world.  But to him, living in a small town in Texas in the `30s, that world was populated by ""maggots of corruption,"" and was a dangerous place filled with outlaws, thieves and robbers.  He masked his true poetic nature with an outwardly gregarious manner and bravura, which, along with his self-imposed exile from society made his on-again-off-again relationship with Price nearly insurmountable.  To the world, he gave Conan the Barbarian and some of the greatest action adventures ever written; to Novalyne he gave the sunrise, the sunset and the moon, but was incapable of giving himself, telling her, ""The road I walk, I walk alone.""  Not that it was what he wanted, but it was all he knew how to do in the ""real"" world, which he sadly never learned to negotiate.Working from a sensitive, extremely well written screenplay by Michael Scott Myers, Ireland compassionately explores Howard's world through the eyes of Novalyne Price.  What we see is an enigmatic, lonely man struggling with the demons of his soul, who escapes to the worlds of his fantasies in order to cope with life.  He is most comfortable talking about his work, and the lands of his imagination.  When relating one of his ""yarns, as he called his stories, he is on his feet, swelling his chest and becoming Conan, sword in hand, battling beasts and enemies and rescuing scantily clad women from harm.  He is transported by his own characters, and watching, the audience is taken along with him, swept away by the passion in his eyes and the sounds of clanking swords.  When he writes, he speaks his words aloud, passionately losing himself in the story even as he is creating it.  And these scenes, backed by the captivating score by Hans Zimmer and Harry Gregson-Williams, are especially powerful and emotionally riveting, which underscores the action and heightens the emotional level and the viewers involvement with the characters and the story.  Ireland juxtaposes the intimacy of the story with some stunning visuals and superb cinematography that will keep Howard and Price in your memory long after the film has ended.  It's terrific work by Ireland, and deserving of the highest acclaim.In a criminally unacclaimed and overlooked performance, Vincent D'Onofrio is absolutely astounding in the role of Bob Howard.  The work he does here can stand alongside the best performances of the greatest actors.  In this film, he IS Howard, physically and emotionally, from the inside out.  He captures every emotion, vividly, with nuance and to perfection; the repressed feelings, the constant, inner turmoil of the man who had confidence in the one thing he knew how to do-- write-- but who also recognized that he was a misfit who lacked even the basic, everyday skills of survival.  It's a painful portrait of a tortured individual to whom one can relate and empathize because of D'Onofrio's consummate skill as an actor.  It's simply a staggeringly powerful and memorable performance.Renee Zellweger gives an excellent performance, as well, as Novalyne Price, this somewhat progressive, though rather straight-laced young woman frustrated time and again in her attempts to break through the complexities of this man to whom she is ready to devote her life.  It's an endearing portrait of a strong, yet vulnerable woman willing to forego many of the conventions of the times for the man she loves, if only he would meet her halfway.  She creates a character with whom you can readily sympathize and identify, making Novalyne very real and her relationship with Howard believable.  It's a beautiful piece of work, for which-- like D'Onofrio-- she did not receive the attention she deserved.The supporting cast includes Ann Wedgeworth (Mrs. Howard), Harve Presnell (Dr. Howard), Benjamin Mouton (Clyde), Michael Corbett (Booth), Helen Cates (Enid), Leslie Berger (Ethel) and Chris Shearer (Truett).  There's life as we'd like it to be, and life as it really is, and ""The Whole Wide World"" is a masterfully presented character study that succinctly examines that situation.  It's an insightful and emotionally gripping film that explores human nature and the often incomprehensible workings of the mind that compel individuals to do what they must do.  In the end, it's a film that will touch you in many ways, and will linger in your thoughts for more than just a little while.",5,Beautiful and Touchingly Realized Drama,987379200,"04 16,

166955,AKA1BO09MI170,0800196333,"Richard Stone ""Author""","[1, 2]","Getting back into reading Robert E. Howard's pulp stories, and being impressed again with his visceral, if a little overblown, energy permeating through every page, I decided to learn more about the man.  I knew he lived in a small town with his folks, and really did't get out much, but had very little idea as to his personality.Now, it goes without saying this movie is a mix of fact and fiction, even thouh it is based on a biographical work of the woman second closest to him before his tragic end, the first being his mother.  Usually these types of movies delve into sentimental fluff as opposed to the hard conflicting emotions that permeate through every relationship, but this movie is certainly an exception.  It seemed Robert had his side that was constantly looking to be acknowledged and respected, and the other side that enjoyed being a misfit in the world, and a terrible fear of what would happen to his writing his he started walking with ""civilized"" society.Anyone familiar with Robert's works knows the type of man he looked up to.  He loved the loner who had a thirst for life regardless of how vicious the world around him one.  He loved the hero who saw the world as nothing but barbarism masked under civilization that the hero always saw through for what it truly was.  His heroes loved life all the same.  He seemed to see the world as petty, sadistic, and empty, but lacked the will for life that his characters had.His lack of trust of the outside world is what doomed his relationship with the school teacher, and caused him to latch on to a kind if overbearing mother.  I found it amusing how his female characters acted at certain points when he was writing while dating her.  While they were at tough times they were vicious and heartless while when things were going well they were innocent and fragile.Overall, this was an excellent movie, and one of the few romances I really managed to enjoy.  The acting was excellent, the scenery of Texas was sublime, and the script was excellent.  There were maybe two scenes that seemed a little unbelievable, especially the last five minutes of the movie, though only a hard cynic could not see the treasure that these two shared.",5,A stunning look into one of pulp fiction's greats,1225756800,"11 4, 2008",2008,2206,"['Getting', 'back', 'reading', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Howard', 'pulp', 'stories', 'being', 'impressed', 'again', 'visceral', 'little', 'overblown', 'energy', 'permeating', 'page', 'decided', 'learn', 'more', 'man', 'knew', 'lived', 'small', 'town', 'folks', 'really', ""did't"", 'get', 'out', 'much', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'idea', 'personality.Now', 'saying', 'movie', 'mix', 'fact', 'fiction', 'even', 'thouh', 'based', 'biographical', 'work', 'woman', 'second', 'closest', 'tragic', 'end', 'first', 'being', 'mother', 'Usually', 'types', 'movies', 'delve', 'sentimental', 'fluff', 'opposed', 'hard', 'conflicting', 'emotions', 'permeate', 'relationship', 'movie', 'certainly', 'exception', 'seemed', 'Robert', 'had', 'side', 'was', 'constantly', 'looking', 'be', 'acknowledged', 'respected', 'other', 'side', 'enjoyed', 'being', 'misfit', 'world', 'terrible', 'fear', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'writing', 'started', 'walking', 'civilized', 'society.Anyone', 'familiar', 'Robert', 'works', 'type', 'man', 'looked', 'up', 'loved', 'loner', 'who', 'had', 'thirst', 'life', 'regardless', 'how', 'vicious', 'world', 'one', 'loved', 'hero', 'who', 'saw', 'world', 'nothing', 'barbarism', 'masked', 'civilization', 'hero', 'always', 'saw', 'what', 'truly', 'was', 'heroes', 'loved', 'life', 'same', 'seemed', 'see', 'world', 'petty', 'sadistic', 'empty', 'lacked', 'will', 'life', 'characters', 'had.His', 'lack', 'trust', 'outside', 'world', 'what', 'doomed', 'relationship', 'school', 'teacher', 'caused', 'latch', 'kind', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'found', 'amusing', 'how', 'female', 'characters', 'acted', 'certain', 'points', 'when', 'was', 'writing', 'dating', 'were', 'tough', 'times', 'were', 'vicious', 'heartless', 'when', 'things', 'were', 'going', 'well', 'were', 'innocent', 'fragile.Overall', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'one', 'few', 'romances', 'really', 'managed', 'enjoy', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'scenery', 'Texas', 'was', 'sublime', 'script', 'was', 'excellent', 'were', 'maybe', 'two', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'little', 'unbelievable', 'especially', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'movie', 'only', 'hard', 'cynic', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'treasure', 'two', 'shared']",N/A

A simple yet moving tale of true love.Based on the memoirs of Novalyn Price, veers around her relationship with the creator of &quot;Conan The Barbarian&quot; and &quot;Kull The COnqueror&quot;, Bob Howard, who committed suicide. The period is 1930s, location: small-town Texas. Novalyne is a school teacher who wishes to be a published writer, and Howard is already established as a pulp fiction maverick. Both are in their late 20's.As such, you'd think that's a weak scaffolding to lay a spectacular movie on, but the story tiptoes at a very good pace.

I think we can all relate to this tragic love where time and circumstances and differences make it unrequited like Romeo and Juliet.  Somehow you're hoping it will defy the inevitable. Renee and Vincent were so astounding that it took a while for that story to wear off. Still, I think about it from time to time.  A story of love that develops between two writers.  One published and one aspiring. The conflict between wrong timing and personal differences serve as the catalyst.  One needing something the other can't give or that would kill the other (emotionally) to give it.  One person okay with life... they other very unsettled.  Two magnets often repelling but attracting is the best description of the true love story that will leave you wishing you could experience that type of love yourself... but perhaps maybe on a better basis. I've not forgotten Vincent D'Onofrio since.  Never recognized him much before this movie and couldn't forget his presence afterward.

True, and this was Howards most well-known character but Howard did so much more.  King Kull, Solomon Kane, Bran Mak Morn, El Borak...horror stories such as ""Pigeons from Hell"" and Skull-Face that rivaled anything contemporaries such as Lovecraft or Clark Ashton Smith did, historical adventures, westerns.The genius of Robert E. Howard was not in the creation of Conan, a Character that has survived for over 70 years and grown in popularity, it's in Howard's recognizing markets for his work.  While Lovecraft wrung his hands over every word and survived on 5 cent cans of spaghetti, Howard knew how to sell his stories.  He willingly canibalized his own work and would take a successful story, and re-write it for a different type of market.  While REH never got rich, his ability to market kept him with a steady paycheck through the depression years.The Whole Wide World is based on the book ""One who Walked Alone"" and tells the story of Howards short but remarkable life through the eyes of perhaps his only love, teacher Novelyne Price, who wrote the book.  It's a story about their relationship as Howard transforms in dispostion from as wild and brutal as his barbarian creation, to the gentle, thoughful, and beautiful person that was evident in much of His poetry.Howard's life was short, a mere 30 years before he committed suicide after learning of his dear mother's terminal medical condition.  Vincent D'Ononfrio and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger's performances were absolutely deserving of Oscar nominations if not wins.

A &quot;little film&quot; that so captured my heart four years ago that I bought the book upon which it's based and the video when it came out. I'm writing this review after viewing the video yet again in the hopes that someone else will watch this treasure and spread the word so that it will get the recognition and audience it deserves.The story of the love between Robert E. Howard and Novalyne Price is brought to life effectively by actors Vincent D'Onofrio and Renee Zellweger. They show an incredible understanding of their characters and depth of feeling in their portrayals. You can't help being frustrated by their attempts to connect, and yet you know that their true hearts somehow do.What this film also shows like no other I've seen is the reality of loving an artist--one who is consumed by his work, his art, his passion. And how you can be dear to that person but still outside of his world. Added to this, of course, is an obsessive mother-son relationship that somehow comes across as sympathetic.So Novalyne had her work cut out for her, but she also had incredible strength and will forces of her own. Although she doesn't deeply question the conventions of society, she recognizes her debt to them. She achieves much in her own life and refuses to get cynical. And Renee Zellweger embodies her and makes us feel her deep esteem and appreciation for Robert E. Howard.Vincent D'Onofrio is a wonder. You've got to see this movie to appreciate the way he brings the pulp writer to larger than life. D'Onofrio has done many great roles, but I think at this point his portrayal of Robert E. Howard is a career-best.It's a romance, an adventure, a history, and an intrigue all in one, featuring one of the most passionate screen kisses ever, a great score, beautiful vistas, and wondrous performances.",5,This is a gem that should become a classic...,978652800,"01 5, 2001",2001,1846,"[""'m"", 'afraid', 'wo', ""n't"", 'A', 'quot', 'little', 'film', 'quot', 'so', 'captured', 'heart', 'four', 'years', 'bought', 'book', 'based', 'video', 'when', 'came', 'out', ""'m"", 'writing', 'review', 'viewing', 'video', 'yet', 'again', 'hopes', 'someone', 'else', 'will', 'watch', 'treasure', 'spread', 'word', 'will', 'get', 'recognition', 'audience', 'story', 'love', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Howard', 'Novalyne', 'Price', 'brought', 'life', 'effectively', 'actors', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'show', 'incredible', 'understanding', 'characters', 'depth', 'feeling', 'portrayals', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'being', 'frustrated', 'attempts', 'connect', 'yet', 'know', 'true', 'hearts', 'somehow', 'film', 'also', 'other', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'reality', 'loving', 'artist', 'one', 'who', 'consumed', 'work', 'art', 'passion', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'dear', 'person', 'still', 'world', 'Added', 'course', 'obsessive', 'mother-son', 'relationship', 'somehow', 'sympathetic.So', 'Novalyne', 'had', 'work', 'cut', 'out', 'also', 'had', 'incredible', 'strength', 'will', 'forces', 'own', ""n't"", 'deeply', 'question', 'conventions', 'society', 'debt', 'much', 'own', 'life', 'get', 'cynical', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'feel', 'deep', 'esteem', 'appreciation', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Howard.Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'wonder', ""'ve"", 'got', 'see', 'movie', 'appreciate', 'way', 'pulp', 'writer', 'larger', 'life', ""D'Onofrio"", 'done', 'many', 'great', 'roles', 'think', 'point', 'portrayal', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Howard', 'career-best.It', 'romance', 'adventure', 'history', 'intrigue', 'one', 'featuring', 'one', 'most', 'passionate', 'screen', 'kisses', 'ever', 'great', 'score', 'beautiful', 'vistas', 'wondrous', 'performances']",N/A

Likewise, I'm not a fantasy fiction fan, but this film knocked me out. Robert Howard, the creator of Conan and other fantasy fiction characters, is wonderfully portrayed as a passionate author who shouts his tales (or yarns, as he calls them) as he writes, and is generally considered by the locals to be a nutcase.This film reveals Howard through his relationship with a school teacher in Depression-Era Texas. Based on the book, One Who Walks Alone, from the personal journal (diary?) of the school teacher, Novalyne Price the film is biographical. Everything from the era-costumes to the acting is first-rate. Both Vincent D'Ononfrio (best known as the quirky detective in the TV Series Law & Order: Criminal Intent) and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger are at their best and represents a brilliant matching of character and casting. Both of these actors are so overwhelmingly strong in their respective roles, the secondary actors, while fitting perfectly, fade into the background.This could have been a film noir, but it is not, and I'm glad of it. Instead it is a tale of two people working through life and romance--both trying to understand and overcome life's obstacles with left-handed success. Their attraction to one another is based on a mutual interest in expressing their experiences through writing. While representing only a short period in Howard's life, and telling very little of what led to Howard's fantasy writings, it tells a great deal about how both Howard and Price view life and one another.Wonderful film, don't miss it.",5,You Don't Have to Care about Conan to Enjoy this Film,1105833600,"01 16, 2005",2005,1643,"['am', 'only', 'vaguely', 'aware', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'mainly', 'Arnold', 'Guv', 'film', '1970', 'Likewise', ""'m"", 'not', 'fantasy', 'fiction', 'fan', 'film', 'knocked', 'out', 'Robert', 'Howard', 'creator', 'Conan', 'other', 'fantasy', 'fiction', 'characters', 'wonderfully', 'portrayed', 'passionate', 'author', 'who', 'tales', 'yarns', 'generally', 'considered', 'locals', 'be', 'nutcase.This', 'film', 'reveals', 'Howard', 'relationship', 'school', 'teacher', 'Depression-Era', 'Texas', 'Based', 'book', 'One', 'Who', 'Walks', 'Alone', 'personal', 'journal', 'diary', 'school', 'teacher', 'Novalyne', 'Price', 'film', 'biographical', 'Everything', 'era-costumes', 'acting', 'first-rate', 'Vincent', ""D'Ononfrio"", 'best', 'known', 'quirky', 'detective', 'TV', 'Series', 'Law', 'Order', 'Criminal', 'Intent', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'are', 'best', 'brilliant', 'matching', 'character', 'casting', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'overwhelmingly', 'strong', 'respective', 'roles', 'secondary', 'actors', 'fitting', 'perfectly', 'fade', 'background.This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'noir', 'not', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Instead', 'tale', 'two', 'people', 'working', 'life', 'romance', 'trying', 'understand', 'overcome', 'life', 'obstacles', 'left-handed', 'success', 'attraction', 'one', 'based', 'mutual', 'interest', 'expressing', 'experiences', 'writing', 'representing', 'only', 'short', 'period', 'Howard', 'life', 'telling', 'very', 'little', 'what', 'led', 'Howard', 'fantasy', 'writings', 'great', 'deal', 'how', 'Howard', 'Price', 'view', 'life', 'one', 'another.Wonderful', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss']",N/A
