I am thinking to myself, ""Why is the film still called The Crush?"" Anyway, the movie is not bad at all. Most of the time, the plot is entirely plausible. Of course, Nick Eliot, played well by Cary Elwes, didn't think his problem out better than anticipated. For anyone watching The Crush could learn from this experience and know better what to do with a severely under-aged girl when it comes to inappropriate relations, especially sex. This is happening at an alarming rate in America today and even more so in schools. The story behind The Crush is serious stuff, and I thought the film was executed very well. Yeah, Alicia Silverstone is a candidate for Worst Actress Ever, but she did fine in the film. The cast were good enough to pull it off. Really, what made The Crush to be watchable is the premise of it. It's just that the movie wasn't suspenseful or unpredictable enough.",4,Well...This Was Good.,1290902400,"11 28, 2010",2010,999,"['Viewed', '1/05', '12/07Rate', '712/07', 'tagline', 'Crush', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'crush', 'was', 'dead', 'wrong', 'am', 'thinking', 'myself', 'Why', 'film', 'still', 'called', 'Crush', 'Anyway', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'Most', 'time', 'plot', 'entirely', 'plausible', 'course', 'Nick', 'Eliot', 'played', 'well', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'problem', 'out', 'better', 'anticipated', 'anyone', 'watching', 'Crush', 'could', 'learn', 'experience', 'know', 'better', 'what', 'do', 'severely', 'under-aged', 'girl', 'when', 'inappropriate', 'relations', 'especially', 'sex', 'happening', 'alarming', 'rate', 'America', 'today', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'schools', 'story', 'Crush', 'serious', 'stuff', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'executed', 'very', 'well', 'Yeah', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'candidate', 'Worst', 'Actress', 'Ever', 'did', 'fine', 'film', 'cast', 'were', 'good', 'enough', 'pull', 'off', 'Really', 'what', 'made', 'Crush', 'be', 'watchable', 'premise', 'just', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'suspenseful', 'unpredictable', 'enough']",N/A
339266,A2582KMXLK2P06,6302821665,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","Do NOT be fooled by the Crush like I was- the description and the category it falls under is *both* entirely wrong.  It's NOT a love story, and it's NOT simply about a 14-year old girl who falls in love with a 28-year old writer who temporarily moves into her home.  That is one *entirely* inaccurate description right there!The Crush is actually a suspense similar to the Hand That Rocks the Cradle and Orphan.  This 14-year old girl has severe mental issues and throughout the film she loves to find clever and incredibly sick and twisted ways to either torture or go the extra distance and *kill* everyone around her that she doesn't approve of.  This would be Alicia Silverstone's character, of course.She's extremely smart, and knows a lot about bees, manipulating peoples feelings, and pretending to be someone she's most certainly not.  I can't BELIEVE I've never heard of this film until now.Seriously, the first 20 minutes of storytelling will guide you down the misguided path into believing this is a simple love story involving a much older man and a younger woman, but soon the tone and atmosphere will turn ominous and suspenseful before you even know what hit you.  I love it!Overall, well truth be told, NOTHING will ever beat Orphan.  That movie illustrates a more demented and convincing little girl (with a better emphasis on tricking her parents time and time again and the emotional roller coaster ride that follows, that's for sure).  Still, since these type of suspense films appeal to me a great deal, I have no choice but to absolutely love the Crush.You will constantly feel sorry for the 28-year old man who has to put up with such a deranged little girl!

339267,A1ARQYFYXAL4I,6302821665,bonsai chicken,"[21, 25]","Some films can easily be described as ""x meets y.""  These usually aren't very good films.  In this case, the movie is a blend of Lolita and Fatal Attraction.  Nick Elliott (Cary Elwes) is an investigative journalist new in town who needs a place to stay and work, so he ends up renting the guest room of a fairly well-off family in the suburbs.  He catches the eye of Adrian (Alicia Silverstone), their gifted fourteen year-old daughter.  Her ""crush"" on Nick develops at a breakneck pace.  She pesters him constantly, in person and on the phone, tries to seduce him when they're alone, and becomes insanely jealous of anyone else he spends time with, particularly a female photographer he's currently working with.Unless you didn't watch any movies in the last twenty years, you can probably see where it's going.  As far as thrillers go, Fatal Attraction is probably the most imitated.  Malicious, Swimfan, if you've seen any of these you won't be surprised by The Crush.  There's a lot of sub par acting from people capable of much better, and incredibly cheesy writing.  The only reason to watch this film would be to see Silverstone being sexy, although seeing Elwes slug her and send her flying across the room almost makes it all worthwhile.The DVD contains trailers and cast bios.",2,"A predictable, derivative thriller",1106524800,"01 24, 2005",2005,1287,"['films', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'described', 'x', 'meets', 'y', 'usually', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'films', 'case', 'movie', 'blend', 'Lolita', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'Nick', 'Elliott', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'investigative', 'journalist', 'new', 'town', 'who', 'place', 'stay', 'work', 'up', 'renting', 'guest', 'room', 'fairly', 'well-off', 'family', 'suburbs', 'eye', 'Adrian', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'gifted', 'fourteen', 'year-old', 'daughter', 'crush', 'Nick', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'constantly', 'person', 'phone', 'tries', 'seduce', 'when', ""'re"", 'alone', 'insanely', 'jealous', 'anyone', 'else', 'time', 'particularly', 'female', 'photographer', 'currently', 'working', 'with.Unless', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movies', 'last', 'twenty', 'years', 'can', 'probably', 'see', 'where', 'going', 'As', 'far', 'thrillers', 'go', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'probably', 'most', 'imitated', 'Malicious', 'Swimfan', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'Crush', 'lot', 'sub', 'par', 'acting', 'people', 'capable', 'much', 'better', 'incredibly', 'cheesy', 'writing', 'only', 'reason', 'watch', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'see', 'Silverstone', 'being', 'sexy', 'seeing', 'Elwes', 'slug', 'send', 'flying', 'room', 'almost', 'worthwhile.The', 'DVD', 'trailers', 'cast', 'bios']",N/A
339268,A1YB29BIDULEYE,6302821665,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[2, 2]","This is actually a frightening movie in many aspects. It starts fairly normal with the protagonist (Nick Elliot) relocating because he has landed a new job. (Good plausible start) He innocently rents a house from some seemingly nice people who have an interesting daughter (Silverstone). While Nick is having his difficulties establishing relations with his new boss (Michael), he does have the luxury of meeting a nice young woman (Amy). (Good) But Nick's situation becomes increasingly difficult as he learns to his surprise that Silverstone (the 14 year old daughter of the people he rents from) has developed a crush on him. While it seems almost innocent at first, Nick learns that this 14 year old girl's obsession with him is approaching very dangerous levels. I don't want to say too much and ruin the movie for you, but there is a great amount of suspense, some much needed comic relief moments, and a horror that you don't find in many other movies. (A realistic terror that requires no blood.) Perhaps the most frightening thing about this movie is that as the viewer, we know that Nick is innocent of what he is accused of; but, we probably won't be too surprised when most of the characters in the story are a lot more ready to believe Silverstone even though she is very dishonest. (The scene where Nick's once difficult boss comes to his aid outlines this quite nicely.)

Here she is what might be called a Lolita from hell.  Director Alan Shapiro even has her do a Sue Lyon (from Kubrick's 1964 Lolita) looking-over-her-sunglasses imitation to start the film.  We soon learn that she is 14 ""almost 15.""  (Silverstone was actually 15-years-old during the filming.)  She is also rich and very talented, plays a classical piano, knows the scientific names of beetles and wasps, has skipped two grades, etc.  The film itself might be dubbed a kind of ""Fatal Attraction"" for teeny-boppers.Cary Elwes plays Nick Eliot who is looking for some digs as the film begins.  He is a writer who just got a gig with an important, trendy magazine.  After nearly bumping into Adrian (Silverstone) with his car, he looks askance and sees a sign advertising a cottage for rent in back of a large house with estate.  Turns out this is where Adrian lives with her parents.Somehow this reminds me of William Holden as the writer Joe Gillis pulling into that driveway on Sunset Boulevard (1950).  He should have looked in the other direction!  He should have run the other way!  When Little Miss Crazy gets a crush, it is a hum-dinger.  Maybe Nick should have just surrendered at the start and she would have been bored with him in a couple of months at most.  But unfortunately, Nick Eliot is the epitome of the clueless male.  He doesn't see the danger until it is too late.  He is slightly compromised because he has kissed her, he has wandered about her house when her parents haven't been at home, and worse yet he doesn't have an inkling of the strength of her passion. To be honest I felt a little sorry for her having to deal with all that rejection!  I think this would have played more realistically had Adrian's part been given to an ugly little shrew in the making.  But then of course the film would not have found any kind of audience.Well, this is a familiar premise and the kind I like to see worked out and resolved--well, I like to look at Alicia.  Unfortunately Alan Shapiro, who also wrote the script, has the originality of a photocopy machine and just milks the premise while mindlessly escalating the bizarro.  Suffice it to say that Little Miss Crazy doesn't take no for an answer and that Nick stupidly behaves in a way that just makes his situation worse.

But it is enjoyable to watch.  It's not suspenseful but it gives you sudden thrills and shocks.  A mere few seconds can scare you pretty bad.  It got my adrenaline going when Amy got stung by wasps.  Cary and Alicia are great actors that fit their roles very well.  Also worthy of honorable mention is Kurtwood Smith(you gotta see him in That 70's Show).  Nick isn't that smart but is very admirable because he's nobody's fool.  He's very deserving to have a girl like Amy.  The concept that anyone out there can develop an obsessive crush is scary and watching this movie, with that concept, can send chills down your spine.  I'm proof of that.

Filmed with Alicia Silverstone was still considered ""in"", it helped revitalize the slightly dying thriller genre. Not too often are thrillers focused on young adults doing the slaying/stalking, and I give applause to the writers for having Darian be intelligent and not just nutty for a change.Some of her resentment and personal insecurities come off very real, focused -- things many people have gone through. The Crush simply took things up to another level and showed how much loneliness and desperation can really destroy.This movie wasn't unpredictable -- deaths and attacks were easy to predetermine, and then they were carried out the suspense was low. Aides, allies, and reactions were all expected. So don't go in thinking there's something here to figure out, or that it would be an intense ride.Although Darian was moodier than a smoker trying to kick the habit cold turkey, it's not really told why. Some ""backstory"" was told but with no explanation. Not a big deal though -- she could have just been born a few marbles short.The ominous friend Cheyenne (Amber Bensen) got a bit on my nerves. Acting was on the mark but she seemed an obvious and stereotypical plot ploy placed for more victim-possible-fodder and just to fill in the gaps to the audience.Nick (Cary Elwes) came off as genuinely real and an all around cool guy. He handled ""events"" with finesse and I sympathized.The ending show down was great and some of the only tension was here -- sensational acting from Silverstone made Darian seem deranged and freaky. Some blood simmering moments in tension, although she was stopped easily - of course there's a sense of irony there. She's not a superhuman slasher, she's simply a nutty girl who won't chill out.Obsession is dangerous -- the Crush illustrated this brilliantly.",3,Interesting...,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,1856,"['Crush', 'film', 'used', 'watch', 'often', 'back', 'day', 'Filmed', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'was', 'still', 'considered', 'helped', 'revitalize', 'slightly', 'dying', 'thriller', 'genre', 'Not', 'too', 'often', 'are', 'thrillers', 'focused', 'young', 'adults', 'doing', 'slaying/stalking', 'give', 'applause', 'writers', 'having', 'Darian', 'be', 'intelligent', 'not', 'just', 'nutty', 'change.Some', 'resentment', 'personal', 'insecurities', 'come', 'off', 'very', 'real', 'focused', 'things', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'gone', 'Crush', 'simply', 'took', 'things', 'up', 'level', 'showed', 'how', 'much', 'loneliness', 'desperation', 'can', 'really', 'destroy.This', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'unpredictable', 'deaths', 'attacks', 'were', 'easy', 'predetermine', 'then', 'were', 'carried', 'suspense', 'was', 'low', 'Aides', 'allies', 'reactions', 'were', 'expected', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'thinking', 'something', 'here', 'figure', 'out', 'would', 'be', 'intense', 'ride.Although', 'Darian', 'was', 'moodier', 'smoker', 'trying', 'kick', 'habit', 'cold', 'turkey', 'not', 'really', 'told', 'why', 'backstory', 'was', 'told', 'explanation', 'Not', 'big', 'deal', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'born', 'few', 'marbles', 'short.The', 'ominous', 'friend', 'Cheyenne', 'Amber', 'Bensen', 'got', 'bit', 'nerves', 'Acting', 'was', 'mark', 'seemed', 'obvious', 'stereotypical', 'plot', 'ploy', 'placed', 'more', 'victim-possible-fodder', 'just', 'fill', 'gaps', 'audience.Nick', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'came', 'off', 'genuinely', 'real', 'cool', 'guy', 'handled', 'events', 'finesse', 'sympathized.The', 'ending', 'show', 'down', 'was', 'great', 'only', 'tension', 'was', 'here', 'sensational', 'acting', 'Silverstone', 'made', 'Darian', 'seem', 'deranged', 'freaky', 'blood', 'simmering', 'moments', 'tension', 'was', 'stopped', 'easily', 'course', 'sense', 'irony', 'there', 'not', 'superhuman', 'slasher', 'simply', 'nutty', 'girl', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'chill', 'out.Obsession', 'dangerous', 'Crush', 'illustrated', 'brilliantly']",N/A

339292,A3UA046AA3DXFD,6302821665,Sid the Elf,"[1, 1]","Ahhh the year of 1993. What a glorious time it was for a very young Sid the Elf. That was really the year that began this fantastic journey that nobody could have predicted. With all these years of truly one of a kind laughs, stories, and memories there has been a plethora of B behind it. Nothing quite inspired a super terrific night like a good old B flick from the 90's, especially one starring Alicia Silverstone. Back then she was simply the tops. Sid even had a huge poster of her mug directly above his bed, just so she could greet you on the way in. Even Santa couldn't walk past without the patented ""ohhhh mama."" For some strange reason we never watched the Crush until now. We knew it was out there...wonder why we never went after it. This is very perplexing. Just as confusing as the fact the Breakfast Club is on right now and the old boy is loving it again. Huh, maybe after a ten year break it's finally watchable again. You should check it out again Mario. Anywho, The Crush is a film long overdue but did not disappoint. In fact Sid is very sorry he didn't tackle this as a youth because Alicia Silverstone was the right amount of younger and hotter.Right off the bat we had an immediate star with the appearance of the ""boy you could have done a lot better then him"" guy from Seinfeld. Once we realized he was the main star next to Alicia we knew this was going to be quite good. His superior acting skills must have landed him that Seinfeld gig. In this role he plays a journalist named Nick Elliot who just moved out to California. Maybe he was there to end the crazy deficet spending or do the people's work. He winds up renting a pool house behind a huge mansion where a young cute girl named Adrienne (Silverstone) lives. The only thing missing was Will Smith and Carlton. For some reason she thinks Nick is the ultimate meatball and starts making advances. When he shoots her down things get NUTS! You wanna get nuts? Let's get nuts! This chick throws one s***fit after the other until she accuses him of being sexual and violent landing him a nice arrest. After he gets interviewed by Hanson he was allowed to leave with his shirt over his face into Police custody. Obviously he regains his reputation and gets her sent to a mental institution where she still stalks his life via mail.The Crush was pretty much an awesome move. It was actually decent while being B all at once. Not to mention Silverstone was quite the little ticket. And we're pretty sure she was legal and just made to be a 14 year old in the movie. She 18! So we don't feel like To Catch a Predator machines. Her insane spats were something of epic proportions and completely hilarious. Well also pretty creepy at the same time. Sid totally could have seen Lindy pulling some of these stunts. Something happened. The best part of the movie is the end where he punches her square in the fact sending her 30 feet across the room. It got rewound 4 times just to soak in all it's hilarity. The movie really never leaves you in any sense of boredom but does leave you feeling uncomfortable at times. She really played crazy to the maximum capacity. We must suggest The Crush for any fan of some 90's B, Alicia Silverstone, or the ""boy you could have done a lot better then him"" guy. Seriously that guy may receive a Woody Award for best specs in a film since Santa's mini fridge specs of 94.",4,He behind his cage a crazy crazy,1317340800,"09 30, 2011",2011,3382,"['year', '1993', 'What', 'glorious', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'Sid', 'Elf', 'was', 'really', 'year', 'began', 'fantastic', 'journey', 'nobody', 'could', 'have', 'predicted', 'years', 'truly', 'one', 'kind', 'laughs', 'stories', 'memories', 'there', 'been', 'plethora', 'B', 'Nothing', 'quite', 'inspired', 'super', 'terrific', 'night', 'good', 'old', 'B', 'flick', '90', 'especially', 'one', 'starring', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'Back', 'then', 'was', 'simply', 'tops', 'Sid', 'even', 'had', 'huge', 'poster', 'mug', 'directly', 'bed', 'just', 'could', 'greet', 'way', 'Even', 'Santa', 'could', ""n't"", 'walk', 'patented', 'ohhhh', 'mama', 'strange', 'reason', 'never', 'watched', 'Crush', 'now', 'knew', 'was', 'there', 'wonder', 'why', 'never', 'went', 'very', 'perplexing', 'Just', 'as', 'confusing', 'fact', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'right', 'now', 'old', 'boy', 'loving', 'again', 'Huh', 'maybe', 'ten', 'year', 'break', 'finally', 'watchable', 'again', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'again', 'Mario', 'Anywho', 'Crush', 'film', 'long', 'overdue', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'fact', 'Sid', 'very', 'sorry', 'did', ""n't"", 'tackle', 'youth', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'was', 'right', 'amount', 'younger', 'hotter.Right', 'off', 'bat', 'had', 'immediate', 'star', 'appearance', 'boy', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'lot', 'better', 'then', 'guy', 'Seinfeld', 'realized', 'was', 'main', 'star', 'Alicia', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'quite', 'good', 'superior', 'acting', 'skills', 'must', 'have', 'landed', 'Seinfeld', 'gig', 'role', 'journalist', 'named', 'Nick', 'Elliot', 'who', 'just', 'moved', 'out', 'California', 'Maybe', 'was', 'there', 'end', 'crazy', 'deficet', 'spending', 'do', 'people', 'work', 'up', 'renting', 'pool', 'house', 'huge', 'mansion', 'where', 'young', 'cute', 'girl', 'named', 'Adrienne', 'Silverstone', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'was', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Carlton', 'reason', 'Nick', 'ultimate', 'meatball', 'making', 'advances', 'When', 'shoots', 'down', 'things', 'get', 'NUTS', 'wan', 'na', 'get', 'nuts', 'Let', 'get', 'nuts', 'chick', 'one', 's***fit', 'other', 'being', 'sexual', 'violent', 'landing', 'nice', 'arrest', 'interviewed', 'Hanson', 'was', 'allowed', 'leave', 'shirt', 'face', 'Police', 'custody', 'Obviously', 'reputation', 'sent', 'mental', 'institution', 'where', 'still', 'stalks', 'life', 'mail.The', 'Crush', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'awesome', 'move', 'was', 'actually', 'decent', 'being', 'B', 'once', 'Not', 'mention', 'Silverstone', 'was', 'quite', 'little', 'ticket', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'was', 'legal', 'just', 'made', 'be', '14', 'year', 'old', 'movie', '18', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Catch', 'Predator', 'machines', 'insane', 'spats', 'were', 'something', 'epic', 'proportions', 'completely', 'hilarious', 'Well', 'also', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'same', 'time', 'Sid', 'totally', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'Lindy', 'pulling', 'stunts', 'Something', 'happened', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'end', 'where', 'square', 'fact', 'sending', '30', 'feet', 'room', 'got', 'rewound', '4', 'times', 'just', 'soak', 'hilarity', 'movie', 'really', 'never', 'sense', 'boredom', 'leave', 'feeling', 'uncomfortable', 'times', 'really', 'played', 'crazy', 'maximum', 'capacity', 'must', 'suggest', 'Crush', 'fan', '90', 'B', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'boy', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'lot', 'better', 'then', 'guy', 'Seriously', 'guy', 'may', 'receive', 'Woody', 'Award', 'best', 'specs', 'film', 'Santa', 'mini', 'fridge', 'specs', '94']",N/A

If your a fan of films that feature deranged women boardering on the line of insanity ""The Crush"" is for you. Alicia Silverstone plays a 14 year old obsessed by an older man, played by British cutie Cary Elwes (famous for his role in the first ""Saw"" film). When the older man doesn't return the same feelings that the young girl inhabits for him, all hell breaks out for him and those around him including his girlfriend. ""The Crush"" is very similar in theme to movies like ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle"", ""Misery"", and ""Fatal Attraction"", that feature beautiful women wanting to wreak vengence on those around them for one reason or another. I enjoyed the film since I love female villin films. For Cary Elwes fans there's a hot shower scene featuring his back side as well.

339297,A3GGMPRYCQ87CY,6302821665,The Cool Guy,"[7, 17]","I thought this movie was very realistic. It confirms what I have found out in real life: that teenage girls are seductive, flirting, spiteful, jealous, lying, conniving, and Evil little creatures that will make you regret the day you were ever born.In this movie and in real life, teenage girls often harass older men until they go crazy. They also get jealous of some guys' older girlfriends and try to kill them. (As we found out the hard way, didn't we babe? I'm so sorry for what she did to you.)This movie was also realistic because it showed how teenage girls make shrines dedicated to the man they love, filled with candles. Believe me, I have seen many of these throughout my career as a police detective, and now as a professional private investigator. You wouldn't believe how many murders committed by rich white chicks with carousels in their attics go unreported by the media in this country.(This can only be because of the bias of the mainstream media, which is not surprising considering that all of the media is secretely controlled by evil teenage girls who are plotting to overthrow the government and take control of the world. But I digress...)This movie should serve as a warning for all you men out there. It is difficult, but you will just have to put up with all those teenage girls constantly throwing themselves at you. Better yet, just run away! Or be gay. Do it for your own good!On a side note, I am really surprised that Alicia Silverstone had the courage as an actress to portray teenage girls for what they really are in this movie. She is to be commended for that.The movie is informative, and educational.

339298,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,6302821665,the masked reviewer,"[3, 4]","Don't tell us they don't make Bad Movies like they used to. The Crush, a 1993 gigglefest about a teen psycho-nymphet who makes life a living hell for the twice-her-age writer who's renting out her parents' guest house, is a Bad Movie gem. Alicia Silverstone plays this Lolita-ish minx--think Poison Ivy in a Wonderbra--who one second is displaying herself nude to renter Cary Elwes and the next is trying to murder his photographer girlfriend, Jennifer Rubin, by shoving swarms of buzzing wasps into a darkroom's ventilation system. We'd guess that Silverstone, who rapidly exhausts her repertoire of three expressions (coy, steamy, wacko), honed her acting licks studying the oeuvre of Cybill Shepherd. When she chirps lines at Rubin like, ""Don""t worry, Amy, some guys really like girls with small breasts,"" we can only hope for Silverstone's sake that some guys like girls with teensy talent. And we'd guess that Elwes, who rapidly exhausts his repertoire of one expression (self-enchanted), honed his acting licks by studying the oeuvre of Ryan O'Neal. Just like O'Neal in What's Up, Doc?--but that movie was intended as a comedy--Elwes hopes to pass himself off as an intellectual by donning specs. Indeed, when Silverstone finds him chomping on a cigar while writing, he explains, preposterously, ""Helps me think.""But it's in its crackpot plotting and kamikaze ripoffs of other moviemakers that The Crush attains Bad Movie nirvana. When Elwes can't hack a Pique magazine assignment about a Michael Milkenesque arbitrager, 14-year-old Silverstone secretly rewrites his story so brilliantly that it becomes a career-maker for him. Later, explaining her actions, Silverstone--who sounds to us like she's learned every word of her dialogue phonetically--says, ""Your split infinitives put such stress on the adverbs.""For plot reasons, Elwes's character just up and becomes stupid, which the actor does manage to convey. Long after Silverstone has etched a rather nasty word onto the hood of his car, made a room into a candle-lit shrine to him and phoned him to say, ""Guess what? Got my period. Definitely not pregnant,"" you'll be screaming aloud, ""Ever think of moving, Cary?"" Of course, if he did, we wouldn't get to savor such prize moments as Silverstone cooing, ""Ever do a virgin?"" Or the scene in which the heroine's rich daddy, wielding a pair of pliers, tells Elwes what he plans to do to the horny guys his little girl will soon attract: ""Some friggin' kid'll be standin' there with his hard-on stickin' out of his pants,"" he says. ""Hope I don't go breakin' it off!"" By the time Silverstone gets around to the most implausible plot twist of all--she accuses Elwes of raping her and people actually believe her--you'll be breaking in half with hilarity.With two stars incapable of having a crush on anyone but their mirrors, we're afraid that writer-director Alan Shapiro's crush on Alfred Hitchcock is the only crush on display: Silverstone freaks out in full riding gear, like Tippi Hedren in Marnie; when Rubin fights off those wasps, it's shot like the finale of The Birds; then, falling, she grabs a curtain, like Janet Leigh in the Psycho shower. In the absurd climax, Elwes fights for his life on a twirling carousel straight out of Strangers on a Train, only this one's in an attic (don't ask).Our favorite moment, though, is an original. Elwes, disturbed from his sleep by chopping noises and angry screams, investigates to find a sweaty, crazily wide-eyed Silverstone hacking away at lemons. He asks what she's doing and she hisses, ""Making lemonade. Want some?""
