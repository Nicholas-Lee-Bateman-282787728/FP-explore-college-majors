I'm still patiently waiting for Amazon to tell me when I am getting my pre-ordered copy. The day of release they were back ordered and out of stock. Hope to be able to enjoy this by Christmas if not sooner.Even so, Pink is my all time favorite artist. Since I've not been able to catch her show live here in the states on this or her previous Funhouse tour, the tour dvd is my ticket to this amazing show.What I would like to know, however is why it was originally supposedly released on December 3rd here in the states and then suddenly was out of stock and backordered, and now it says this item will be released on January 21st. So which is it Amazon? Was it ever actually available on December 3or was the release date always January 21? I will wait another month for it because I am a huge fan, but I wish Amazon had been upfront about the real release date from the beginning.

This was hands-down THE BEST concert I've ever attended(& I've attended hundreds of them). She is the most spectacular live performer/singer of this generation.

1673380,A27WC6NFB5LJ5U,B00FTGYNUS,"R. Perez ""rperez_01""","[14, 17]","What can be said about Pink's &#34;Truth About Love&#34; tour? Quite frankly, it's brilliant. It's a combination of gyrating, titillating, and energetic theatrics. The artists (as I'll call her dancers, because they do more than dance) help Pink create a show that is part rock concert, part Cirque du Soleil. This tour ups the ante in using Pink's gymnastics background as many tricks are used in the production. While many singers claim that it is difficult to put on a show and sing completely live and dance full out, Pink proves that it can surely be done. No, she may not have intricate choreography for every upbeat song but the energy that goes into her tissue, bungee, and free fall work uses much more strength.The recording itself is why I did not rate it a 5/5. As previous reviewers mentioned, the direction isn't that great. It goes from cut to cut and you begin to feel dizzy. Having seen the show live, it is great to be able to see the intricate detail given to the show so I am pleased that this show was filmed. The tour in en par with her Funhouse Tour which was also filmed in Australia.If you ever have the opportunity to catch a Pink show live, definitely go.",4,Raise your glasses for Pink,1386460800,"12 8, 2013",2013,1182,"['What', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Pink', '34', 'Truth', 'Love', '34', 'tour', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'brilliant', 'combination', 'gyrating', 'titillating', 'energetic', 'theatrics', 'artists', ""'ll"", 'call', 'dancers', 'do', 'more', 'dance', 'help', 'Pink', 'create', 'show', 'part', 'rock', 'concert', 'part', 'Cirque', 'du', 'Soleil', 'tour', 'ante', 'using', 'Pink', 'gymnastics', 'background', 'many', 'tricks', 'are', 'used', 'production', 'many', 'singers', 'claim', 'difficult', 'put', 'show', 'sing', 'completely', 'live', 'dance', 'full', 'out', 'Pink', 'can', 'surely', 'be', 'done', 'No', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'intricate', 'choreography', 'upbeat', 'song', 'energy', 'tissue', 'bungee', 'free', 'fall', 'work', 'much', 'more', 'strength.The', 'recording', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'rate', '5/5', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'mentioned', 'direction', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'cut', 'cut', 'begin', 'feel', 'dizzy', 'Having', 'seen', 'show', 'live', 'great', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'intricate', 'detail', 'given', 'show', 'so', 'am', 'pleased', 'show', 'was', 'filmed', 'tour', 'en', 'par', 'Funhouse', 'Tour', 'was', 'also', 'filmed', 'Australia.If', 'ever', 'have', 'opportunity', 'catch', 'Pink', 'show', 'live', 'definitely', 'go']",PINK - The Truth About Love Tour: Live From Melbourne

However as I look back and now re-watched basically the same concert I can't help but think P!nk should try to grow up some. While The Truth About Love as a whole is a critically acclaimed album it is far from her best effort, and when does love always mean trashy sexual remarks at a show? Truth is she is a mother now and has a husband and to put stuff out like this is 10 years outdated. The one tour that I believe was her best was the Funhouse tour, it wasn't over the top in references or anything it was just a darn good show. This one not so much.

1673385,A21FTEVCKPM5PC,B00FTGYNUS,"vanman ""mam""","[17, 18]","I have been to 2 of the &#34;Truth About Love&#34; tour shows and enjoyed each one immensely.  I've been a huge P!NK fan since seeing the Funhouse tour DVD in 2009.  I even have P!NK FAN on my Ohio license plates.But, that said, I must admit that the jumpy editing of this concert has taken away much from this DVD.  I have to agree with other comments that talk about the jumping from scene to scene.  The continuity with the music is there, but with each image on view for only seconds, it is hard to watch and focus on something you'd like to follow on stage.I'm a big fan of Eva Gardner, too, and tried to find and follow her on this DVD, but it was almost as if she wasn't there.  From being at the shows, I knew where to look, but had trouble seeing her more than just a very few times in the 1 hour and 50 minutes.Like the Funhouse tour DVD, this one has images that last from one to 6 seconds max on screen,  My calculations say that for the one hour and 50 minutes there must be between 4,000 and 5,000 images used to make this DVD.  I'm amazed they could keep the music in sync.But that frantic image changing, and the many shots of the audience singing along captures the energy that is present at a P!NK concert.  The audience is part of the show and no one sits for any of it.  Everyone is on their feet and the DVD catches that energy.But, I wish I would have been able to follow the dancers through their routines and see Eva Gardner doing her thing.I still recommend this DVD for those who didn't get to see the tour shows to see what it was like and for those who did to relive it.",4,It catches the excitement of being there!,1390089600,"01 19, 2014",2014,1598,"['have', 'been', '2', '34', 'Truth', 'Love', '34', 'tour', 'shows', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'immensely', ""'ve"", 'been', 'huge', 'P', 'NK', 'fan', 'seeing', 'Funhouse', 'tour', 'DVD', '2009', 'even', 'have', 'P', 'NK', 'FAN', 'Ohio', 'license', 'plates.But', 'said', 'must', 'admit', 'jumpy', 'editing', 'concert', 'taken', 'away', 'much', 'DVD', 'have', 'agree', 'other', 'comments', 'talk', 'jumping', 'scene', 'scene', 'continuity', 'music', 'there', 'image', 'view', 'only', 'hard', 'watch', 'focus', 'something', ""'d"", 'like', 'follow', 'stage.I', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Eva', 'Gardner', 'too', 'tried', 'find', 'follow', 'DVD', 'was', 'almost', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'being', 'shows', 'knew', 'where', 'look', 'had', 'trouble', 'seeing', 'more', 'just', 'very', 'few', 'times', '1', 'hour', '50', 'Funhouse', 'tour', 'DVD', 'one', 'last', 'one', '6', 'seconds', 'max', 'screen', 'My', 'calculations', 'say', 'one', 'hour', '50', 'minutes', 'there', 'must', 'be', '4,000', '5,000', 'images', 'used', 'make', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'could', 'keep', 'music', 'sync.But', 'frantic', 'image', 'changing', 'many', 'shots', 'audience', 'singing', 'along', 'energy', 'present', 'P', 'NK', 'concert', 'audience', 'part', 'show', 'one', 'Everyone', 'feet', 'DVD', 'catches', 'energy.But', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'follow', 'dancers', 'routines', 'see', 'Eva', 'Gardner', 'doing', 'thing.I', 'still', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'tour', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'like', 'who', 'did', 'relive']",PINK - The Truth About Love Tour: Live From Melbourne
