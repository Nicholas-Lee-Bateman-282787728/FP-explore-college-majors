The film is visually so artistic and beautiful and also very magical in many ways too, just ask the dog.  The actersses are beautiful in a very natural and real way and their chemistry is intense. It is a unique story too, done in a way I have never seen before or since. I am not a artsy person really but so many of my friends are and often I find their interests/creations/tastes  over the top for me in stretching my open mind.  This film has some scenes that are very circus (dont think elephants think Cirque de Solais) like and very magical and they are entertaining in a unique way.

402247,ARK5SAGVLW3FY,6304111762,bunnyrabbit4,"[28, 28]","Most Lesbian films are just plain bad. With the rare exception of a film like Desert Hearts, they are mindless romps by undeveloped characters. They always end in the bedroom, usually to a lush musical score, because the plot literally can't go anywhere else. This film is not only a good lesbian film but a beautiful, artistically rendered chronical of a quirky relationship between two very eccentric people. The cinematography alone makes it so visually compelling. It has a fine rhythmic pacing and a color saturation reminiscent of David Lynch. It is so good that you could enjoy it for that alone. One scene that intercuts a car headlight dancing across a wall, a circus act that uses bouncing lights behind a screen and a man and woman making love turns editing into an artform. The really sad thing about this film is that it took so long to come out on DVD that it lost its original audience. The release went largely unnoticed and the DVD promptly dissappeared from the marketplace. How sad when so many mindless films are still readily available.

I try to expand my horizons by watching films that I wouldn't have thought to watch, one of those films is ""When Night is Falling"". I thought the general premise of the film where two women who were complete opposites and immediately become attracted to each other in this film was a lot more convincing than in most films that involved heterosexual couples. Pascale Bussieres plays Camille who works at a extremely conservative Christian college. She meets Petra (played by the gorgeous Rachel Crawford) in the laundrymat. Petra briefly comforts Camille because earlier that day, Camille's dog got loose and was hit by a car. Smitten, Petra switches her clothes with Camille's just so she can see Camille again. Her chance encounters with the unconventional circus performer leads Camille down a path of self-discovery and she slowly learns to really enjoy life. She quickly becomes torn between her rigid, conservative life with her fiance, a fellow theologian professor at the school she works at and a more free-spirit life that Petra leads. Eventually Camille makes her choice. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The music really captured the ambience of the film. I particularly enjoyed the scenes involving Petra and her circus troupe performing.

These desires made the unlikely relationship between Camille and Petra(who is openly lesbian) much more plausible and believable.I also liked the fact that the movie at times did not take itself too seriously and mixed in some fun and interesting moments with Camille and Petra.  I loved the acrobatic lovemaking scene with the carnival music and the two trapeze artists performing overhead but the scene at the laundry where Petra pulls the old &quot;switch-charoo&quot; is a classic...",4,"Funny, Arty, Romantic, Fun",970531200,"10 3, 2000",2000,1317,"['When', 'Night', 'Falling', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'romantic', 'movies', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'two', 'women', 'falling', 'love', 'other', 'spite', 'world', 'lead', 'actresses', 'Pascale', 'Bussieres', 'Rachael', 'Crawford', 'give', 'wonderful', 'believable', 'performances', 'main', 'characters', 'Camille', 'Petra.The', 'romantic', 'soft-focus', 'cinematography', 'mellowy', 'music', 'be', 'overused', 'cliche', 'most', 'lesbian', 'orientated', 'genres', 'used', 'superbly', 'time', 'director', 'Patricia', 'Rozema', 'who', 'very', 'colorful', 'perspective', 'quot', 'Land', 'North', 'quot', 'felt', 'are', 'many', 'great', 'scenes', 'movie', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'see', 'very', 'straight-minded', 'Camille', 'having', 'lesbian', 'fantasties', 'probaly', 'most', 'important', 'scene', 'Camille', 'potential', 'desire', 'be', 'other', 'woman', 'desires', 'made', 'unlikely', 'relationship', 'Camille', 'Petra', 'who', 'openly', 'lesbian', 'much', 'more', 'plausible', 'believable.I', 'also', 'liked', 'fact', 'movie', 'times', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'mixed', 'fun', 'interesting', 'moments', 'Camille', 'Petra', 'loved', 'acrobatic', 'lovemaking', 'scene', 'carnival', 'music', 'two', 'trapeze', 'artists', 'performing', 'overhead', 'scene', 'laundry', 'where', 'Petra', 'old', 'quot', 'switch-charoo', 'quot', 'classic']",When Night Is Falling VHS

Summers ""Gamekrazy""","[5, 6]","A lot of times, as good as the story behind a movie might be,without the right actors to carry it off, it can still bomb.Fortunately, in this case, they found the right actresses for the mainroles, and made a decent movie.  Pascale Bussieres(Camille), andRachael Crawford(Petra), two actresses I had never heard of beforeseeing them in this movie, literally shine during their performances,and they each have their own unique brand of beauty to bring to thescreen.Camille is a teacher at a religious college, and Petra is acircus performer, who meet one night at a laundromat where Camille hasa break down over the fact that her dog had died earlier that day.Petra offers her some comfort, takes both their laundries from thedryers when they are done, and seeming accidentally switches theirclothes, although she does this on purpose because she is attracted toCamille, and wants to see her again.  This scene worked for me,although if it had been a man who had done it it might have seemed abit banal, but this fit Petra's character, and seemed cute. ...Thereare no real heroes or villains in the movie, just people who react towhat is going on around them to the best they can, and two women whoare drawn to one another, and act upon their feelings.The one lamenote of the movie, besides the slightly pedantic hang gliding episode,is the ending of the movie.  I don't really want to give it away,but it just didn't really seem strong enough, or real enough to endthe movie I had been watching.  That aside, I enjoyed the movie as awhole, and I certainly hope you at least rent if for yourself, and seewhat you think.One last word about the actresses.  As I saidearlier, both of them are charming and beautiful, and seem to fittheir roles wonderfully.  Camille, with her pale sort of beauty,unsure, and trying to discover what she wants out of life, and Petra,with her dark sort of exotic looks, and trying to find someone she canlove.

402270,AX810NX9AUN9Z,6304111762,"Sian Stargazer ""The Stargazer""","[5, 14]","If one was to look at the pic on the DVD package, one would expect a passionate love story between two women who are in conflict with societal norms.  However, one would be disappointed.  Instead, the viewer is saddled with a film that strains the boundaries of viewer patience.First, let me give you the plot. A professor at a christian university, Camille(Pascale Bussieres), is having a crisis after the death of her beloved pet dog, Bob; and this death is the catalyst for her examining her life.  Enter into the conflict a flamboyant young circus performer, Petra (Rachel Crawford), who's free-spirited ways and creepy stalker-like behaviour titillate Camille and the pair begin an affair that culminates in Camille having to choose between the comfortable, safe, and boring life she has with her boyfriend. Or the more care-free unpredictable life with Petra.The most glaring fault of the film is that most of the focus is on creating a visually stunning film. In this, Rozema (director) succeeds.  It's in the plot details and character depictions that the film falls flat.One of the problems is that Camille's boyfriend and the people in her more secure and traditional life are mere cardboard cutouts lacking any depth.  We don't get know them as people so we don't care about them.  And since we don't care about these characters, we don't understand the depth and breadth of Camille's conflict when she begins to consider running away with a circus performer.  Creating more defined characters with real feelings, motivations, and agendas would have made the conflict and the ultimate choice more satisfying. Especially since more time is spent on Petra's crowd of tattooed oddball associates.Another challenge is the acting of Rachel Crawford.  Her acting style is heavy-handed and unpolished and just plain unbelievable.  This is most evident in the scene when confronts her lover, Camille, with her patronising behaviour towards the other circus entertainers.Bussieres is the better actress, but she is given so little to work with. Her character's motivation for upending her life is the death of a dog; granted the death of pet can be painful, but I hardly think it would warrant her suddenly going round the bend and beginning a same sex affair and threatening her career and long-term relationship. If the death had been of a parent, or her longtime boyfriend, the emotional fall-out would have made more sense as grief makes us contemplate our life choices with more depth and awareness.  Even when the character begins to act out as she contemplates life outside of her comfort zone, the viewer is left wanting; Camille's idea of wild is wearing a jumper with a cutout in the chest and flashing it at her boyfriend with a mischievous smile.It's in her character's development that we notice some of the most glaring deviations.  For example, if you work at a conservative university, would you really go to a superior to tell them that you're seriously reflecting on your sexual preference lately? Oh, come on.Basically, the film is long on visual beauty and slight on plot and character development.  Also, the happy Hollywood ending was irritating!  Have we, as viewers, come to expect so little of our filmmakers that we accept this pallid little film as art?  It's a toddling baby step forward for Rozema, but falls quite short of true art.",1,ZZZZ!,1319241600,"10 22, 2011",2011,3364,"['one', 'was', 'look', 'pic', 'DVD', 'package', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'passionate', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'conflict', 'societal', 'norms', 'However', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Instead', 'viewer', 'saddled', 'film', 'boundaries', 'viewer', 'patience.First', 'let', 'give', 'plot', 'professor', 'christian', 'university', 'Camille', 'Pascale', 'Bussieres', 'having', 'crisis', 'death', 'beloved', 'pet', 'dog', 'Bob', 'death', 'catalyst', 'examining', 'life', 'Enter', 'conflict', 'flamboyant', 'young', 'circus', 'performer', 'Petra', 'Rachel', 'Crawford', 'who', 'free-spirited', 'ways', 'creepy', 'stalker-like', 'behaviour', 'titillate', 'Camille', 'pair', 'begin', 'affair', 'Camille', 'having', 'choose', 'comfortable', 'safe', 'boring', 'life', 'boyfriend', 'more', 'care-free', 'unpredictable', 'life', 'Petra.The', 'most', 'glaring', 'fault', 'film', 'most', 'focus', 'creating', 'visually', 'stunning', 'film', 'Rozema', 'director', 'plot', 'details', 'character', 'depictions', 'film', 'flat.One', 'problems', 'Camille', 'boyfriend', 'people', 'more', 'secure', 'traditional', 'life', 'are', 'mere', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'lacking', 'depth', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'depth', 'breadth', 'Camille', 'conflict', 'when', 'consider', 'running', 'away', 'circus', 'performer', 'Creating', 'more', 'defined', 'characters', 'real', 'feelings', 'motivations', 'agendas', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'conflict', 'ultimate', 'choice', 'more', 'satisfying', 'Especially', 'more', 'time', 'spent', 'Petra', 'crowd', 'tattooed', 'oddball', 'associates.Another', 'challenge', 'acting', 'Rachel', 'Crawford', 'acting', 'style', 'heavy-handed', 'unpolished', 'just', 'plain', 'unbelievable', 'most', 'evident', 'scene', 'when', 'lover', 'Camille', 'patronising', 'behaviour', 'other', 'circus', 'entertainers.Bussieres', 'better', 'actress', 'given', 'so', 'little', 'work', 'character', 'motivation', 'upending', 'life', 'death', 'dog', 'granted', 'death', 'pet', 'can', 'be', 'painful', 'hardly', 'think', 'would', 'warrant', 'suddenly', 'going', 'bend', 'beginning', 'same', 'sex', 'affair', 'threatening', 'career', 'long-term', 'relationship', 'death', 'had', 'been', 'parent', 'longtime', 'boyfriend', 'emotional', 'fall-out', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'grief', 'contemplate', 'life', 'choices', 'more', 'depth', 'awareness', 'Even', 'when', 'character', 'act', 'out', 'life', 'comfort', 'zone', 'viewer', 'left', 'wanting', 'Camille', 'idea', 'wild', 'wearing', 'jumper', 'cutout', 'chest', 'flashing', 'boyfriend', 'mischievous', 'smile.It', 'character', 'development', 'notice', 'most', 'glaring', 'deviations', 'example', 'work', 'conservative', 'university', 'would', 'really', 'go', 'superior', 'tell', ""'re"", 'seriously', 'reflecting', 'sexual', 'preference', 'lately', 'Oh', 'come', 'on.Basically', 'film', 'long', 'visual', 'beauty', 'slight', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'Also', 'happy', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'was', 'irritating', 'Have', 'viewers', 'come', 'expect', 'so', 'little', 'filmmakers', 'accept', 'pallid', 'little', 'film', 'art', 'toddling', 'baby', 'step', 'forward', 'Rozema', 'quite', 'short', 'true', 'art']",When Night Is Falling VHS

I think this could have been a great story / film if only the story ad been developed a little more carefully...",2,Shocked!,1325376000,"01 1, 2012",2012,667,"['am', 'completely', 'shocked', 'amount', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'movie', 'been', 'getting', 'just', 'watched', 'thus', 'story', 'circus', 'environment', 'something', ""'m"", 'strongly', 'attracked', 'somehow', 'felt', 'empty', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'strong', 'role', 'think', 'what', 'most', 'liked', 'just', 'felt', 'completely', 'disconnected', 'somehow', 'could', ""n't"", 'manage', 'connect', 'one', 'either.It', 'seemed', 'wanted', 'make', 'most', 'story', 'least', 'amount', 'time', 'budget', 'came', 'out', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'story', '/', 'film', 'only', 'story', 'ad', 'been', 'developed', 'little', 'more', 'carefully']",When Night Is Falling VHS
402273,A1H5E7O5BW2J13,6304111762,V.C.,"[0, 1]","I don't understand how this film has garnered so many five-star reviews and is considered to be one of the ""best"" lesbian films out there. My main gripe is that as visually beautiful this film is, more was spent on aesthetics than on an actual plot and character development.There was never a sense of urgency or danger. Okay, so we get that the main character (Cecille) is in a relationship with another man and lives a very conservative lifestyle and career, but there was so little spent on their relationship and so little spent on the background of her ""conservative"" life that I never felt that connected or emotionally invested in it. When she does start being involved with another woman (Petra), I still didn't feel that there was any tension or conflict other than Cecile's flakiness and blatant rudeness to her. Though their connection was beautifully conveyed, I still didn't really understand why Petra was soo attracted to her especially when Cecille would deliberately try and hide their relationship and even called her a ""street kid"" to the Reverend. I just didn't find it believable that Petra would still fall for this woman...after all that. As for the subplot with her dog passing away...it is indeed sad when you lose a pet since it is like losing family, but I can't honestly imagine a passing of a beloved pet being the primary reason for two people to fall in love with each other and for someone to sacrifice their current relationship and career for a lifestyle that they apparently don't fit into. It just wasn't realistic and seemed very contrived, silly, and unbelievable. And what was up with the ending? How is it possible for a dog to be dead for days/weeks in a fridge, later buried in the snow, and then just magically pops out from the ground out of the snow and running as if it was trying to return to Cecille? I get it was symbolic (or trying to anyway) but c'mon...not only cheesy but just downright stupid, honestly.Though I admire this film's efforts at trying to create a lesbian film where it's passionate and erotic, there was virtually no plot and so little character development. I also couldn't stand the flakiness/fickleness of Cecille coming to terms with her relationship with Petra. I don't so much mind the whole conflict with her choosing between her man versus the woman she loves but why in these lesbian films does the woman have to treat her female lover so cruelly for the sake of being with a man that she isn't even in love with? And why would that female lover so willingly want to be with a woman who wants to keep their relationship a ""secret"" or who would push her aside for some jerk? I liked the circus aspect but it seemed so lacking in spark and imagination...the characters in this circus were not the least bit interesting...heck none of the characters in this movie had depth or personality. It's a shame because this film does have potential...but was so lacking some life, personality, and character...and a beautiful love story that really should have rested on its own...the boyfriend conflict was so unnecessary and didn't even add anything to the film and wasn't fleshed out enough. I think this story would have worked better if let's say instead of the dog passing away, her current boyfriend passed away instead, and Cecille starts her new life by being with a female lover and joining the circus with her. That would have made for a more interesting story but alas, that was not what the story went for.",2,Overrated,1348531200,"09 25, 2012",2012,3485,"['do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'film', 'garnered', 'so', 'many', 'five-star', 'reviews', 'considered', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'lesbian', 'films', 'there', 'main', 'gripe', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'film', 'more', 'was', 'spent', 'aesthetics', 'actual', 'plot', 'character', 'development.There', 'was', 'never', 'sense', 'urgency', 'danger', 'Okay', 'get', 'main', 'character', 'Cecille', 'relationship', 'man', 'very', 'conservative', 'lifestyle', 'career', 'there', 'was', 'so', 'little', 'spent', 'relationship', 'so', 'little', 'spent', 'background', 'conservative', 'life', 'never', 'felt', 'connected', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'When', 'start', 'being', 'involved', 'woman', 'Petra', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'tension', 'conflict', 'other', 'Cecile', 'flakiness', 'blatant', 'rudeness', 'connection', 'was', 'beautifully', 'conveyed', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'why', 'Petra', 'was', 'soo', 'attracted', 'especially', 'when', 'Cecille', 'would', 'deliberately', 'try', 'hide', 'relationship', 'even', 'called', 'street', 'kid', 'Reverend', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'believable', 'Petra', 'would', 'still', 'fall', 'woman', 'that', 'subplot', 'dog', 'passing', 'away', 'indeed', 'sad', 'when', 'lose', 'pet', 'losing', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'imagine', 'passing', 'beloved', 'pet', 'being', 'primary', 'reason', 'two', 'people', 'fall', 'love', 'other', 'someone', 'sacrifice', 'current', 'relationship', 'career', 'lifestyle', 'apparently', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'realistic', 'seemed', 'very', 'contrived', 'silly', 'unbelievable', 'what', 'was', 'up', 'ending', 'How', 'possible', 'dog', 'be', 'dead', 'days/weeks', 'fridge', 'later', 'buried', 'snow', 'then', 'just', 'magically', 'out', 'ground', 'snow', 'running', 'was', 'trying', 'return', 'Cecille', 'get', 'was', 'symbolic', 'trying', 'anyway', ""c'mon"", 'not', 'only', 'cheesy', 'just', 'downright', 'stupid', 'honestly.Though', 'admire', 'film', 'efforts', 'trying', 'create', 'lesbian', 'film', 'where', 'passionate', 'erotic', 'was', 'virtually', 'plot', 'so', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'also', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'flakiness/fickleness', 'Cecille', 'coming', 'terms', 'relationship', 'Petra', 'do', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'whole', 'conflict', 'choosing', 'man', 'woman', 'why', 'lesbian', 'films', 'woman', 'have', 'treat', 'female', 'lover', 'so', 'cruelly', 'sake', 'being', 'man', ""n't"", 'even', 'love', 'why', 'would', 'female', 'lover', 'so', 'willingly', 'want', 'be', 'woman', 'who', 'keep', 'relationship', 'secret', 'who', 'would', 'push', 'aside', 'jerk', 'liked', 'circus', 'aspect', 'seemed', 'so', 'lacking', 'spark', 'imagination', 'characters', 'circus', 'were', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'interesting', 'none', 'characters', 'movie', 'had', 'depth', 'personality', 'shame', 'film', 'have', 'potential', 'was', 'so', 'lacking', 'life', 'personality', 'character', 'beautiful', 'love', 'story', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'rested', 'own', 'boyfriend', 'conflict', 'was', 'so', 'unnecessary', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'add', 'anything', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'fleshed', 'out', 'enough', 'think', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'let', 'say', 'instead', 'dog', 'passing', 'away', 'current', 'boyfriend', 'passed', 'away', 'instead', 'Cecille', 'new', 'life', 'being', 'female', 'lover', 'joining', 'circus', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'interesting', 'story', 'alas', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'story', 'went']",When Night Is Falling VHS
