The camera work is great and keeps you in touch with all 3 members plus the audience.  The set list is very enjoyable.But what is up with the sound?  This is a CONCERT DVD.  We buy these for the sound as much as the visuals, and this one has sub-par sound.  As someone else mentioned there is only one sound stream (stereo), despite a link in the menu that promises DTS surround sound.  That in itself is no big deal.  I'd take great PCM stereo over compressed surround sound any day, but this is NOT great PCM stereo.  It's overdriven and clipped AC3.  I've purchased other DVDs that exhibit similar problems (Allman Bros Beacon Theater comes to mind) and I just don't get it.  Given the storage capacity of DVDs, it's simply inexcusable.Bottom line: It's Joe, so buy the DVD.  But like me, you may lament what should have been.Edit: Actually I do get it.  It's a Rockpalast recording and they typically have minor audio issues.  Maybe they engineer these on the fly for live broadcast, or maybe they record them, but don't take the time to master them to their highest potential.  In any case, the show is great, the band is on fire, and the setting looks pretty cool.  After dozens of listens, I no longer whine about the sound.

Sloan ""thegreyfox""","[5, 11]","plus points:Having seen the new line-up on Sunday in Manchester UK, I was in two minds whether to buy this DVD .... there is no comparison between the melodic and awsome chops of Eric Czar compared to Mark Epstein (who is no more than an adequate bass player, and at times, imo, less than adequate). This DVD is the ""old"" line-up and therefore in my mind, already close to 5 starsGreat song selection, even better playing, good visuals. Very clear. Good colour. Eric Czar is as much a focal point of the band as Joe, and both front men are truely outstanding in their ability.Minus points:The tension in the band compared to the free DVD early in his career is noticeable ( although perhaps if I had not realised they were no longer together this may have not been so noticeable, or even noticeable at all ). You sense that Eric Czar was playing out of his skin for his CV!The DVD contains a link to DTS audio, which does not work. Like the previous reviewer, this is a serious let-down, particularly as the link is there ... is it just my copy ?  So, stereo only for me ... still, it is very good soundJoe Bonamassa is an awesome player, and this is reflected in the DVD.
