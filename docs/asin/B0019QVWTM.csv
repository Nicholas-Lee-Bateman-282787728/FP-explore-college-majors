I was disappointed by this film because with a title like Cannibal Girls, you expect gory, trashy fun. What I got was about one minute of gore, and a couple of minutes of trashy fun. I almost gave this movie two stars instead of three, but the last ten minutes or so are what I expected the whole movie to be: bloody and disgusting. And this film has the hairiest men I've ever seen. There's one man who's arms and back are covered in hair. I'm sure if he would have taken his pants off, his butt would have been as well.

In some parts this film try's to take itself too seriously and in others bad jokes and even bad banter make you roll your eye.

1164677,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0019QVWTM,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 4]","Cannibal Girls (Ivan Reitman, 1973)Ivan Reitman produced and directed some of the most beloved films of the late seventies and early eighties, including Meatballs, Stripes, Ghostbusters, and Heavy Metal. What most people forget when thinking about this is that Reitman started out in horror and low-budget sex, including being the producer of record for David Cronenberg's first big north-of-the-border hits, Shivers and Rabid. So it probably shouldn't be a surprise that Reitman's first directorial efforts were exploitation films like this, an hysterically bad piece of silliness about a haunted restaurant where a young married couple (Eugene Levy and Andrea Martin, who would later become stalwarts of the Second City troupe) are convinced to spend the night. And you have to give Reitman an A for effort; obviously someone who saw this and his other early work found it decent enough to give him a job. (Thank you, Mr. Cronenberg.) But oh, my, this movie is terrible. The script is horrendous, the dialogue painful, the acting less interesting than the landscape (which is badly-shot throughout), the big plot twist, well, not much of a twist at all. Foreshadowing? Foreshadowing with a ballpeen hammer, perhaps.Had it not been directed by Ivan Reitman, this movie would have faded into obscurity years ago.

1164678,A3UAIEHXTUT85G,B0019QVWTM,"S. Boone ""TheatreX""","[8, 8]","Cannibal Girls may well be a curiosity more than a ""must have"", but while it's not overly great, it has a certain strangeness about it that I found appealing.  Pre-SCTV actors Eugene Levy & Andrea Martin play a young couple who go to vacation in the small town of Farnhamville.  They check into a local hotel and, on the recommendation of the manager, they go to dine at a local restaurant that was once the scene of legendary horrors, being that there were three young women who lured men into their farmhouse, where they killed and ate them.  The restaurant is rather creepy and so are their hosts, and after getting a bit tipsy they decide to stay the night, with predictably dire results.  But is this all for real?  Seemingly not, but the nightmare is not quite over.The humor in this is rather dry and will not be appreciated by some.  There are a couple pretty funny moments that were supposedly improvised, and one scene where I did laugh out loud.  Just the idea that our young couple keep going on about how ""beautiful"" the place is that they've chosen to stay in is rather funny in itself, since it's basically just some small dumpy town with lots of dirty snow piled everywhere.  The horror, well, it's nothing you've never seen before but there is also a ""horror horn"" to alert one to scenes where you need to look away if you're squeamish (and the sound of a doorbell, that I suppose is to alert one to when it's OK to look again).There is also a special feature interview with Ivan Reitman & Daniel Goldberg, which gives some insight into the film and the trials and tribulations they went through to complete it.  Some of the interview is interesting but at some point it started feeling almost as long as the film itself.I'd say this has rather limited appeal, it's not rollicking comedy nor is it particularly effective horror either, but it has a certain strangeness about it that I enjoyed.  If you enjoy horror films of early 70's vintage, you'll probably want to see this.  3.5 out of 5 stars.",3,"3.5 stars, more strange than scary, but I kind of liked it",1288051200,"10 26, 2010",2010,2015,"['Cannibal', 'Girls', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'curiosity', 'more', 'must', 'have', 'not', 'overly', 'great', 'certain', 'strangeness', 'found', 'appealing', 'Pre-SCTV', 'actors', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'Andrea', 'Martin', 'play', 'young', 'couple', 'who', 'go', 'vacation', 'small', 'town', 'Farnhamville', 'check', 'local', 'hotel', 'recommendation', 'manager', 'go', 'dine', 'local', 'restaurant', 'was', 'once', 'scene', 'legendary', 'horrors', 'being', 'were', 'three', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'lured', 'men', 'farmhouse', 'where', 'killed', 'ate', 'restaurant', 'rather', 'creepy', 'so', 'are', 'hosts', 'getting', 'bit', 'decide', 'stay', 'night', 'predictably', 'dire', 'results', 'real', 'Seemingly', 'not', 'nightmare', 'not', 'quite', 'over.The', 'humor', 'rather', 'dry', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'appreciated', 'are', 'couple', 'pretty', 'funny', 'moments', 'were', 'supposedly', 'improvised', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'did', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'Just', 'idea', 'young', 'couple', 'keep', 'going', 'how', 'beautiful', 'place', ""'ve"", 'chosen', 'stay', 'rather', 'funny', 'basically', 'just', 'small', 'dumpy', 'town', 'lots', 'dirty', 'snow', 'piled', 'everywhere', 'horror', 'well', 'nothing', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'also', 'horror', 'horn', 'alert', 'one', 'scenes', 'where', 'need', 'look', 'away', ""'re"", 'squeamish', 'sound', 'doorbell', 'suppose', 'alert', 'one', 'when', 'OK', 'look', 'again', 'also', 'special', 'feature', 'interview', 'Ivan', 'Reitman', 'Daniel', 'Goldberg', 'insight', 'film', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'went', 'complete', 'interview', 'interesting', 'point', 'started', 'feeling', 'almost', 'as', 'long', 'film', 'itself.I', ""'d"", 'say', 'rather', 'limited', 'appeal', 'not', 'rollicking', 'comedy', 'particularly', 'effective', 'horror', 'either', 'certain', 'strangeness', 'enjoyed', 'enjoy', 'horror', 'films', 'early', '70', 'vintage', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'see', '3.5', '5', 'stars']",N/A
1164679,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0019QVWTM,trebe,"[0, 1]","Moving at a leisurely pace and told in a disjointed fashion, Cannibal Girls (1973) follows a young couple on vacation in Canada, who find themselves in the midst of great evil a small town.  Directed by Ivan Reitman (Stripes,Ghostbusters), the movie features future SCTV members Andrea Martin and Eugene Levy, as an unsuspecting lovers who encounter a kooky reverend and three young women who practice cannibalism.When their car breaks down in the town of Farningham, young lovers Clifford Sturges (Levy) and Gloria Wellaby (Martin), take lodging at a motel, where the owner informs them of the town's legendary cannibal women.  Three beautiful young ladies, who sometime in the past, made a practice of luring men to their farmhouse, where they were killed and eaten.Cliff and Gloria go to dine a restaurant, located in the residence of Reverend Alex St. John (Ronald Ulrich), which has a rather macabre heritage, and is also the modern home of the three cannibal girls.  The travelers wind up spending the night as guests of St. John, and they experience a strange night of terror.  One of the film's few really scary moments features Gloria running through the snowy woods in the dead of night.  This effective scene apparently turns out to be a dream, however with many in the town aiding St. John, it is not long before the web of evil closes in, and envelops the couple.Shot in Canada under mostly snowy conditions, this low budget production kind of crawls along, and also meanders off track at times, but the occasional instances of violence are pretty well done, and keep things lively.  The acting and dialog isn't particularly good, but Martin and Levy are kind of interesting to watch, at this early point in their careers.  Some decent gore and occasional nudity provides just enough, to make for a mild recommendation.
