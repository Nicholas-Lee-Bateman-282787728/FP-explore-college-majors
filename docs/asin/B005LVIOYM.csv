1493688,A29XGEA02ZHAA3,B005LVIOYM,Colin Duff,"[22, 25]","The Men From Shiloh is a greatly underrated series. It has been running on TV here (Australia) recently....after not being seen for nearly 40 years.Different in style to its predecessor, The Virginian...as it it is set 10 years after the original series. Its ""star"", Stewart Granger, tries hard in the role of Col. McKenzie but the show really belongs to James Drury and Doug McClure. Surprisingly, even Lee Majors (not generally regarded as a ""great"" actor)has some memorable moments in the series.One thing puzzles me...episode #22 ""The Town Killer"" has been broadcast in B&W; both here and in the UK recently. I wonder if the color negative will be used for the DVD release? Or, is it another victim of the Untiversal Studios fire?",4,ALL in color?,1315612800,"09 10, 2011",2011,734,"['Men', 'Shiloh', 'greatly', 'underrated', 'series', 'been', 'running', 'TV', 'here', 'Australia', 'recently', '.after', 'not', 'being', 'seen', 'nearly', '40', 'years.Different', 'style', 'predecessor', 'Virginian', 'set', '10', 'years', 'original', 'series', 'star', 'Stewart', 'Granger', 'hard', 'role', 'Col.', 'McKenzie', 'show', 'really', 'James', 'Drury', 'Doug', 'McClure', 'Surprisingly', 'even', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'not', 'generally', 'regarded', 'great', 'actor', 'memorable', 'moments', 'series.One', 'thing', 'puzzles', 'episode', '22', 'Town', 'Killer', 'been', 'broadcast', 'B', 'W', 'here', 'UK', 'recently', 'wonder', 'color', 'negative', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'DVD', 'release', 'victim', 'Untiversal', 'Studios', 'fire']",The Men from Shiloh - The Final Season from The Virginian- 24 Full Color Episodes! - Special Embossed Tin !
1493689,A28JINLDJZBVHI,B005LVIOYM,"David Walstad ""SC Vandy""","[15, 16]","What's missing from this DVD set?  About six minutes of footage on many of the episodes.  Also missing is broadcast quality picture and sound.  Also missing are bonus tracks.  The biggest problem of the three listed is the inexcusable practice of presenting 70-minute, edited copies instead of 76-minute, full-length network prints.  The artificial act breaks are amateurish.  The jumps into and out of black are awkward.  Re the second point, some of the transfers are horrible, especially when ""day-for-night"" scenes are included.  Images appear much too dark.  And yet some episodes' day scenes appear too bright, where portions of the screen turn bleached white.  The brightness problem is evident in many of the end titles.  Good sound is inconsistent.  In ""The Mysterious Mister Tate"" more than half of the episode occurs on a moving train, yet with no sound (effect) of the moving train.  Obviously Timeless is dealing with decent masters on some episodes and not-fit-for-broadcast masters of others.  Hey Timeless, thoroughly search the vaults -- not a half-assed effort -- and give us the best there is.  That's what we're paying for.  It's not like other DVD distributors are going to be putting ""The Men from Shiloh"" on the market and consumers can then choose the best.  This is our only shot, and you blew it.  The Universal logo appears at the conclusion of end titles on a few episodes (as it should), and not on others.  A bonus track with James Drury and Lee Majors or others discussing the much-anticipated re-tooling of ""The Virginian"" is sorely missing.  And have a knowledgable interviewer lead the discussion; don't let the stars ramble on and on with the result being minimal useful information.  How about having an assistant director, writer, studio/network executive or producer provide purchasers some ""Men from Shiloh"" insight?  How about including the 24 episodic trailers and some NBC promos?  Perhaps a better product box photo than the one of Drury, McClure and Granger with a ""cut-and-paste"" Majors.  So, what I want and expect from Timeless is NO edited prints, a higher standard of picture and audio mastering/duplication and bonus tracks.  Without that, the product warrants (only) two stars.  Haven't yet screened all the episodes, but I did enjoy ""Jenny"" with guest star Janet Leigh.  Compelling story and excellent location work in the desert.  A goof is obvious in the flashback where we see Drury and Leigh many years earlier as lovers.  Drury's dressed in the same shirt (or one very similar) to the one he's wearing throughout the episode! (and throughout ""The Men from Shiloh"").  And speaking of wardrobe, he looks better with a vest.  But a vest he doesn't wear in ""Shiloh,"" unlike ""The Virginian.""  A shame Drury didn't have as good a hair piece as John McIntire and Lee J. Cobb.  His toupee is embarrassing.  I was a big fan of ""The Virginian"" in its first run.  This DVD was a requested (highly-anticipated) Christmas present.  While there's some merit to ""The Men from Shiloh,"" the camaraderie and family feel of the Shiloh Ranch owners and their loved ones and employees and familiarity of the town of Medicine Bow evident throughout eight years of ""The Virginian"" are sorely missed.",2,"Beware! edited prints, not full length!",1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,3233,"['What', 'missing', 'DVD', 'set', 'six', 'minutes', 'footage', 'many', 'episodes', 'Also', 'missing', 'broadcast', 'quality', 'picture', 'sound', 'Also', 'missing', 'are', 'bonus', 'tracks', 'biggest', 'problem', 'three', 'listed', 'inexcusable', 'practice', 'presenting', '70-minute', 'edited', 'copies', 'instead', '76-minute', 'full-length', 'network', 'prints', 'artificial', 'act', 'breaks', 'are', 'amateurish', 'jumps', 'black', 'are', 'awkward', 'Re', 'second', 'point', 'transfers', 'are', 'horrible', 'especially', 'when', 'day-for-night', 'scenes', 'are', 'included', 'Images', 'appear', 'much', 'too', 'dark', 'yet', 'episodes', 'day', 'scenes', 'appear', 'too', 'bright', 'where', 'portions', 'screen', 'turn', 'bleached', 'white', 'brightness', 'problem', 'evident', 'many', 'end', 'titles', 'Good', 'sound', 'inconsistent', 'Mysterious', 'Mister', 'Tate', 'more', 'half', 'episode', 'moving', 'train', 'yet', 'sound', 'effect', 'moving', 'train', 'Obviously', 'Timeless', 'dealing', 'decent', 'masters', 'episodes', 'not-fit-for-broadcast', 'masters', 'others', 'Hey', 'Timeless', 'thoroughly', 'vaults', 'not', 'half-assed', 'effort', 'give', 'best', 'what', ""'re"", 'paying', 'not', 'other', 'DVD', 'distributors', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'putting', 'Men', 'Shiloh', 'market', 'consumers', 'can', 'then', 'choose', 'best', 'only', 'shot', 'blew', 'Universal', 'logo', 'conclusion', 'end', 'titles', 'few', 'episodes', 'should', 'not', 'others', 'bonus', 'track', 'James', 'Drury', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'others', 'discussing', 'much-anticipated', 're-tooling', 'Virginian', 'sorely', 'missing', 'have', 'knowledgable', 'interviewer', 'lead', 'discussion', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stars', 'ramble', 'result', 'being', 'minimal', 'useful', 'information', 'How', 'having', 'assistant', 'director', 'writer', 'studio/network', 'executive', 'producer', 'provide', 'Men', 'Shiloh', 'insight', 'How', 'including', '24', 'episodic', 'trailers', 'NBC', 'promos', 'Perhaps', 'better', 'product', 'box', 'photo', 'one', 'Drury', 'McClure', 'Granger', 'cut-and-paste', 'Majors', 'So', 'what', 'want', 'expect', 'Timeless', 'NO', 'edited', 'prints', 'higher', 'standard', 'picture', 'audio', 'mastering/duplication', 'bonus', 'tracks', 'product', 'warrants', 'only', 'two', 'stars', 'Have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'screened', 'episodes', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Jenny', 'guest', 'star', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'Compelling', 'story', 'excellent', 'location', 'work', 'desert', 'goof', 'obvious', 'flashback', 'where', 'see', 'Drury', 'Leigh', 'many', 'years', 'earlier', 'lovers', 'Drury', 'dressed', 'same', 'shirt', 'one', 'very', 'similar', 'one', 'wearing', 'episode', 'Men', 'Shiloh', 'speaking', 'wardrobe', 'better', 'vest', 'vest', ""n't"", 'wear', 'Shiloh', 'Virginian', 'shame', 'Drury', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'good', 'hair', 'piece', 'John', 'McIntire', 'Lee', 'J.', 'Cobb', 'toupee', 'embarrassing', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'Virginian', 'first', 'run', 'DVD', 'was', 'requested', 'highly-anticipated', 'Christmas', 'present', 'merit', 'Men', 'Shiloh', 'camaraderie', 'family', 'feel', 'Shiloh', 'Ranch', 'owners', 'loved', 'ones', 'employees', 'familiarity', 'town', 'Medicine', 'Bow', 'evident', 'eight', 'years', 'Virginian', 'are', 'sorely', 'missed']",The Men from Shiloh - The Final Season from The Virginian- 24 Full Color Episodes! - Special Embossed Tin !

The ""Virginian"" was changed to ""The Men from Shiloh"" in order to attempt to improve the ratings and obtain a premium return on commercials.  I was surprised how really good it is. Stuart Granger, a retired English Colonel,  does a fine job of the lead role as the new owner of Shiloh ranch.  Lee Majors steps in as a new ranch hand and his episodes are the best of the 24 made.  James Drury and Doug McClure are still with the series and turn in great performances as always.  The episodes now focus on each of the individual characters and although the jovial interaction between the old crew is gone it works just as well.  I genuinely liked the show and can recommend the DVD.  I really do not understand the complaints about it not being pure ""Virginian"".

1493692,A17B55N0YVR48L,B005LVIOYM,Gary M. Gerani,"[10, 10]","...happens to be the oft-mentioned episode #22, ""The Town Killer.""  Ironically, that episode's b/w history in non-domestic markets might be the key to understanding why Timeless' release of MEN FROM SHILOH is literally a pale imitation of VIRGINIAN's vibrant mastering.  My guess is that U released this series for TV broadcasts in Australia and Europe ages ago when transfer quality was far less of an issue.  For some unknown reason, color elements for ""Town Killer"" were temporarily lost, so a b/w print was included in that generally sub-par syndication package.  But once a deal was made in 2011 to release the series on DVD in America with ""every episode in color,"" U felt obliged to replace that old b/w ""Town Killer"" with a color version, which obviously resurfaced.  And guess what?  ""Town Killer"" is complete, has no forced fades, cuts to black for commercial breaks just as it should, and looks absolutely superb -- just as good as THE VIRGINIAN episodes.  Simply compare ""Killer"" to the other shows in the Timeless set and the difference is dramatically apparent...  No whited-out faces or bleached landscapes, no pitch black day-for-night scenes.  Just gorgeous looking, first generation material.  I realize one reviewer mentioned that the sync in this particular episode may be off somewhat, an unfortunate Timeless glitch, if true; but the luminous 35mm negative used for the transfer is the real important news here.  It proves that U still has beautiful original elements on THE MEN FROM SHILOH, that Timeless' mostly disappointing DVD collection only represents what non-domestic markets have been stuck with in syndication all these years (except for the new, polished-up ""Town Killer"").  But you can be sure that if Encore Westerns decides to run this series at some point in the future, and they most likely will, it won't be the bleached, edited, and optically-doctored foreign syndie version we'll be seeing...  but a season's worth of shows taken from the same first generation negative source as ""Town Killer,"" which should be breathtaking.  So enjoy the watchable DVDs we have now, fans and TV historians, knowing that ""the real thing"" isn't lost and may come our way somewhere down the line...

One episode was clearly based on an episode from Season 7, with minor changes (in an interesting coincidence Robert Fuller plays the villain in this episode while his Laramie costar John Smith played the same role in the Season 7 episode).

1493708,A21X2QV24T7S9J,B005LVIOYM,Tomasi,"[17, 19]","The Virginian: The Men From Shiloh has okay episodes (including the outstanding Lady At The Bar, starring Greer Garson, E.G. Marshall, and James Whitmore, Jr.) but lacks the cohesiveness of having regular interaction between the main characters, especially Trampas and The Virginian. Other returning characters from earlier seasons include Sheriff Mark Abbott, who first appeared in 1962, and ranch hand Belden, who became a semi-regular beginning in 1963.The laid back soundtrack, and, in one episode, background audio of a slow singing guitar player, both of which also appeared in Alias Smith and Jones and McCloud during that season, are misplaced here. The earlier seasons of The Virginian all look pristene on Encore Westerns cable channel, which will air them through the end of 2011, and are even more vivid on DVD season sets released by Timeless Media. The 24 episodes of The Men From Shiloh are seperated in syndication from the rest of The Virginian, which is a mistake. Because season 9 of The Virginian: The Men From Shiloh, was not optioned by Encore for broadcast, it has not been restored or remastered, as the package wrongly indicates, and is bleached out, like many Universal shows of the past 50 years (excepting color Wagon Trains and Laredo, which though unrestored seem marvelously intact). Sound quality is also unrestored and sometimes comes across muffled and harsh; in some later shows sound/picture are out of synchronization.Despite all these complaints, it was worthwhile buying this season set, if just to see how The Virginian (1962-1971) ended it's 9 season run in one timeslot on NBC. Including a 1958 black and white half-hour pilot I saw on-line, The Virginian had 250 episodes in total. I hope Timeless will release a complete series box set including the pilot and a (this time) remastered The Virginian: The Men From Shiloh.",3,The Virginian Season 9 Without The Name & Restoration,1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,1864,"['Virginian', 'Men', 'From', 'Shiloh', 'okay', 'episodes', 'including', 'outstanding', 'Lady', 'Bar', 'starring', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'E.G', 'Marshall', 'James', 'Whitmore', 'Jr.', 'cohesiveness', 'having', 'regular', 'interaction', 'main', 'characters', 'especially', 'Trampas', 'Virginian', 'Other', 'returning', 'characters', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'include', 'Sheriff', 'Mark', 'Abbott', 'who', 'first', 'appeared', '1962', 'ranch', 'hand', 'Belden', 'who', 'became', 'semi-regular', 'beginning', '1963.The', 'laid', 'back', 'soundtrack', 'one', 'episode', 'audio', 'slow', 'singing', 'guitar', 'player', 'also', 'appeared', 'Alias', 'Smith', 'Jones', 'McCloud', 'season', 'are', 'misplaced', 'here', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Virginian', 'look', 'pristene', 'Encore', 'Westerns', 'cable', 'channel', 'will', 'air', 'end', '2011', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'vivid', 'DVD', 'season', 'sets', 'released', 'Timeless', 'Media', '24', 'episodes', 'Men', 'Shiloh', 'are', 'seperated', 'syndication', 'rest', 'Virginian', 'mistake', 'season', '9', 'Virginian', 'Men', 'From', 'Shiloh', 'was', 'not', 'optioned', 'Encore', 'broadcast', 'not', 'been', 'restored', 'remastered', 'package', 'wrongly', 'bleached', 'out', 'many', 'Universal', 'shows', 'past', '50', 'years', 'excepting', 'color', 'Wagon', 'Trains', 'Laredo', 'though', 'unrestored', 'seem', 'marvelously', 'intact', 'Sound', 'quality', 'also', 'unrestored', 'sometimes', 'muffled', 'harsh', 'later', 'shows', 'sound/picture', 'are', 'synchronization.Despite', 'complaints', 'was', 'worthwhile', 'buying', 'season', 'set', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'Virginian', '1962-1971', 'ended', '9', 'season', 'run', 'one', 'timeslot', 'NBC', 'Including', '1958', 'black', 'white', 'half-hour', 'pilot', 'saw', 'on-line', 'Virginian', 'had', '250', 'episodes', 'total', 'hope', 'Timeless', 'will', 'release', 'complete', 'series', 'box', 'set', 'including', 'pilot', 'time', 'remastered', 'Virginian', 'Men', 'Shiloh']",The Men from Shiloh - The Final Season from The Virginian- 24 Full Color Episodes! - Special Embossed Tin !

I have purchased the first two seasons and the last season The Men from Shiloh. So far I have watched half of the TMFS shows and there is a big difference in the way the show was produced. Glenn A. Larson, I believe took the reins of producing the series and it just looks different from the original. The first run of the Virginian had great cinema photograghy and it looked fantastic with every show. Larson's production seems to have considered cost as a factor. In my opinion its not up to Frank Price's version. Any way I still love watching The men from Shiloh and the addition of Lee Majors as Tate was interesting since he just came off ABC's The Big Valley. If your a BIG fan of the Virginian and James Drury and the rest of the cast buy it! Four Stars from me.P.S.
