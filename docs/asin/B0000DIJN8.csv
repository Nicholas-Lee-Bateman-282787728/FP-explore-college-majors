778829,AZ2QRRN8JXR6S,B0000DIJN8,"Cesar ""juliomontoya2000""","[10, 10]","If you are afraid of getting this DVD because you think that a 1976 concert must sound and look poor, you'll be completely surprised and amazed at what they have done with this concert. I bet its image and audio are better than some of the concerts recorded nowadays. Anybody would think that it was recorded yesterday. Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating. Let's just say that the footage is unmistakenly from the 70's, but it's completely clean and unscratched. We have some points of comparison: Wild World, as the encore of the concert, is presented as an extra, and the image is untreated (and although is Dolby Digital, it doesn't have the enhanced 5.1 sorround sound of the concert). And the same for what for me is a high point in this collection: the original promo video for ""Father and son"" which sounds very good, but still keeps the visual marks of time. But it matters very little, the main thing is that we're allowed to see and have one of those rare pre-MTV videos.I don't know how they did it, but the quality is incredible, and most of all, this is the greatest gift a Cat Stevens fan can get. And they sure did a great favor to the music in general and to the not so old generations, by giving us (at last) the oppotunity of having a concert of a great artist that decided to give up his fame because of religious conversion. What we have here is a proof of the genius that Cat Stevens was. And it couldn't have been better presented. Get it.

Nearly all of his best songs are performed with unique emotions by the great musicians. Setlist is long and complete, maybe missing a few songs for real fans. Vocal is perfect, and the ambience created by C.S. playing guitar and piano is very special. Sound recording is great for a concert that took place in the 70s.Extras are OK : interviews, footage, photo gallery, etc... but most of all you should take your money out with the goal of having the main concert because featurettes are not the best ever seen on a DVD.A must have for fans, people discovering Stevens and any collector of concert DVD : this is in the top 10 for sure !

778831,A3FX4ENXBQV54R,B0000DIJN8,"Dennis Stephens ""seberg99""","[9, 11]","I got into Cat Stevens in the mid to late seventies while I was still in middle school. He stopped playing before I was able to go to concerts. This is kind of like a dream come true for me to actually see him live.Visually, this DVD is quite good and clean, and the sound is fantastic. The framing is pretty seventies, with a lot of focus on Stevens and not so much on the rest of the band, which included longtime member Alun Davies on second guitar. In fact, Stevens moves so much back and forth that the close up shots of just his head and the microphone are a little disorienting.The selections are all solid, although I do miss ""Can't Keep It In"" and ""Sitting,"" which I was suprised was not in the setlist. This was recorded shortly after the NUMBERS album came out. Stevens voice is rough and emotive, and you see a man truly possessed by his music.The extras are interesting, as is the interview with Yusuf Islam (Cat Stevens). It is apparent he has come to terms with his music and past, and talks freely of his beginnings, career, and faith. There are also some bonus performances that are very nice, including a nice alternate version of ""Tuesday's Dead.""The reviewer who lamented Stevens' stand on the Salmon Rushdie thing is another person that has taken what was said out of context. An explanation of these remarks can be found on the website catstevens.com. Stevens, (now Yusuf Islam) is involved in many charitable causes, and is at peace with himself.Yusuf states that his music was a ""gift from God."" This DVD really lets you know what it was all about.

So often, live recordings do not do justice to the original studio versions. I'll be putting this on just to listen to, even when I am not really watching it. I have no problem with the playlist, for a recording of this length, the selections pretty well match what I would have chosen. This might even be a good investment for someone who is thinking about buying a Cat Stevens anthology on CD, to buy this DVD instead.

As most other reviewers mention, it captures Cat in great form on what would turn out to be his last major tour which included magicians instead of a support opening act, hence the name.The show is wonderful and indeed amazingly restored both aurally and visually. The extras are generous too, and it is the 30 minute 3-part frank interview with today's Yusuf Islam that really touches the heart, mind and spirit. What I remember is the flogging this man took in the media in the 80s for no better reason than the fact that he decided to leave the show biz circus-- (similar to what John Lennon did during his househusband years though for different reasons &quot;no longer riding on the merry go round&quot;...)-- and dedicate his life to what he considers more important things- God, religion, family, the betterment of mankind, among other things. And at the same time, he did not give interviews, deciding to retain his privacy, and the press still made up stories because he wouldn't play the game any more.This is a charming, eloquent, creative, philosophical, inquisitive, peaceful man who has given great joy to millions since he first came into the public eye in 1966/67 and we fans are eternally grateful. His example of &quot;to thine own self be true&quot; and of searching for spiritual strength and truth, regardless of who we call God, is somethng we all should strive for.

I wholeheartedly concur w/ another reviewer who was spot on about the concert music being accelerated. Some musicians/groups just don't perform well in concert, however, I don't think that's true w/ Cat. I think he just had TOO much energy this particular night. Between songs that night at William & Mary, someone should have reminded Cat of a few words from his Father and Son song, ""just relax, take it easy...take your time"" & ""take it slowly."" The tempo [if that's the correct musical term] was just too quick during this concert; the music did not sound right at all. On the other hand, the special features alone are worth the price of the DVD. Loved the lengthy interview, Teaser & the Firecat cartoon [a lot of it was kinda' Yellow Submarine like], & was delighted w/ the live performances for sm audiences, etc. They made up for the concert at W & Mary. In those music videos [about 6 songs total], thankfully, you get Cat Stevens songs played at the correct tempo! FANTASTIC!!!! Cat was 1 of about 10 groups/musicians that I never got to see in concert & even though I did not like the Majikat concert [& I will probably never watch it again], I LOVED the special feature songs/performances. I have already watched those performances & the interviews twice & will watch them many more times over the years.

There is music from the full repertoire of his albums.  And he performs them flawlessly.  (Well a small flaw on ""Lady D'Arbanville,"" but whose counting?)  Stevens had everything going for him.  A marvelous talent for melody.  He seemed to have an inexaustible supply.  A sense of the appropriate lyric.  A voice that could not have been better.  I can't think of a Stevens song without that voice (perhaps cost him in covers, but did him good in the short run).

Afterall, most artists do not perform their entire hit catalogue on stage.If the concert alone wasn't enough to make the DVD pure gold, there is also an array of special features including current interviews with the man himself, and rare archival footage of Cat performing songs on BBC TV and other forums.I really must take my hat off to the DVD producers because they have done a brilliant job of remixing the soundtrack.  The DTS and 5.1 mixes are amazing.  Considering the concert was probably only recorded in 2 channel (which is also available on the DVD) this is quite an achievement.

I wish more artists followed this winning formula. The absolute worst type of DVD is when songs are interrupted by interviews.""Yusuf Islam (born Steven Demetre Georgiou; 21 July 1948 in London, England), commonly known by his former stage name Cat Stevens, is a British musician. He is a singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, educator, philanthropist, and prominent convert to Islam.His early 1970s record albums Tea for the Tillerman and Teaser and the Firecat were both certified as Triple Platinum by the RIAA in the United States; his 1972 album Catch Bull at Four sold half a million copies in the first two weeks of release alone and was Billboard's number-one LP for three consecutive weeks. He has also earned two ASCAP songwriting awards in consecutive years for ""The First Cut Is the Deepest,"" which has been a hit single for four different artists.Stevens converted to Islam at the height of his fame, in December 1977, and adopted his Muslim name, Yusuf Islam, the following year. In 1979, he auctioned all his guitars away for charity and left his music career to devote himself to educational and philanthropic causes in the Muslim community. He has been given several awards for his work in promoting peace in the world, including 2003's World Award, the 2004 Man for Peace Award, and the 2007 Mediterranean Prize for Peace. In 2006, he returned to pop music with his first album of new pop songs in 28 years, entitled An Other Cup. He now goes professionally by the single name Yusuf.[6] His newest album, Roadsinger, was released on 5 May 2009.""",5,CAT CAN DO,1278806400,"07 11, 2010",2010,2052,"['have', 'been', 'Cat', 'fan', 'long', 'time', 'missed', 'absence', 'DVD', 'CD', 'package', 'are', 'perfect', 'really', 'enjoy', 'fact', 'camera', 'persons', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'stars', 'keep', 'focus', 'Cat', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'many', 'quick', 'angle', 'changes', 'tactic', 'DVD', 'sound', 'video', 'quality', 'are', 'excellent', 'opinion', 'One', 'thing', 'notice', 'Cat', 'high', 'energy', 'level', 'head', 'bobblehead', 'doll', 'lol', 'ok', 'wish', 'more', 'artists', 'followed', 'winning', 'formula', 'absolute', 'worst', 'type', 'DVD', 'when', 'songs', 'are', 'interrupted', 'interviews', 'Yusuf', 'Islam', 'born', 'Steven', 'Demetre', 'Georgiou', '21', 'July', '1948', 'London', 'England', 'commonly', 'known', 'former', 'stage', 'name', 'Cat', 'Stevens', 'British', 'musician', 'singer-songwriter', 'multi-instrumentalist', 'educator', 'philanthropist', 'prominent', 'convert', 'Islam.His', 'early', '1970s', 'record', 'albums', 'Tea', 'Tillerman', 'Teaser', 'Firecat', 'were', 'certified', 'Triple', 'Platinum', 'RIAA', 'United', 'States', '1972', 'album', 'Catch', 'Bull', 'Four', 'sold', 'million', 'copies', 'first', 'two', 'weeks', 'release', 'alone', 'was', 'Billboard', 'number-one', 'LP', 'three', 'consecutive', 'weeks', 'also', 'earned', 'two', 'ASCAP', 'songwriting', 'awards', 'consecutive', 'years', 'First', 'Cut', 'Deepest', 'been', 'hit', 'single', 'four', 'different', 'artists.Stevens', 'converted', 'Islam', 'height', 'fame', 'December', '1977', 'adopted', 'Muslim', 'name', 'Yusuf', 'Islam', 'following', 'year', '1979', 'auctioned', 'guitars', 'away', 'charity', 'left', 'music', 'career', 'devote', 'educational', 'philanthropic', 'causes', 'Muslim', 'community', 'been', 'given', 'several', 'awards', 'work', 'promoting', 'peace', 'world', 'including', '2003', 'World', 'Award', '2004', 'Man', 'Peace', 'Award', '2007', 'Mediterranean', 'Prize', 'Peace', '2006', 'returned', 'pop', 'music', 'first', 'album', 'new', 'pop', 'songs', '28', 'years', 'entitled', 'Other', 'Cup', 'now', 'professionally', 'single', 'name', 'Yusuf', '6', 'newest', 'album', 'Roadsinger', 'was', 'released', '5', 'May', '2009']",N/A
