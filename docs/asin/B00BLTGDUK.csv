It has been a joy to watch as the guys who are supposed to protect the public work as a team to get the job done. Each set lists the guests who appear - but be prepared to see your favorites in the role of the villian - even little Ronnie Howard! But, it all ends as it is supposed to end, or at least the way we expect it should end.",5,FBI as the good guys,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,413,"['was', 'first', 'CD', 'set', 'series', 'show', 'scripts', 'held', 'up', 'so', 'well', 'been', 'joy', 'watch', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'protect', 'public', 'work', 'team', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'set', 'guests', 'who', 'appear', 'be', 'prepared', 'see', 'favorites', 'role', 'villian', 'even', 'little', 'Ronnie', 'Howard', 'supposed', 'end', 'least', 'way', 'expect', 'should', 'end']",The FBI: The Fourth Season

1635549,A10STGPXGHL12J,B00BLTGDUK,baker,"[7, 7]","This is one of my favorite shows from the past to watch, as it is a Quinn Martin production, and they always bring out the stars. Even in the minor roles they use my favorite charactor actors. With this release, they finally brought it out as a single set. It still comes split into two cases, but they are bundled together. If you read the reviews from season one, the ones that got the most favorable votes complain the program is too pricey. Well, the price has been dropping with the last two releases. Picture quality is in the eye of the beholder, and considering the age of this show, I find it to be acceptable even though it has not been restored. That would probably drive up the price anyways, and I'm content with what I got.

Its formula was well developed.  The stories work well.  Efrem Zimbalist Jr. was the idealized FBI agent.  William Reynolds was the stalwart sidekick partner.  The stories taken from the files of the FBI make for great drama.  The guest stars were a veritable who's who from that time.

I was really into TV back when I was younger and I am 56 now but I never watch this series that much boy wow when i heard the theme song it brought back memories. It was a great TV series with a great cast and great actors in every show. I give it a 5 star for the series itself and a 3 star for the price.,5,good old TV show but i don't understand why this series cost is so high.,1376524800,"08 15, 2013",2013,379,"['Good', 'old', 'TV', 'show', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'series', 'cost', 'so', 'high', 'was', 'really', 'TV', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'am', '56', 'now', 'never', 'watch', 'series', 'much', 'boy', 'wow', 'when', 'i', 'heard', 'theme', 'song', 'brought', 'back', 'memories', 'was', 'great', 'TV', 'series', 'great', 'cast', 'great', 'actors', 'show', 'give', '5', 'star', 'series', '3', 'star', 'price']",The FBI: The Fourth Season
