Kim Na Na and Lee Yoon Sung are a perfect pairing.  This show is an all-out Action Thriller with a kick-ass soundtrack to keep the suspense going.  The love story is a perk that cannot be denied.

1505938,A1VDRK69F22YMN,B005ZTGRMG,Anticlimacus,"[3, 5]","I love K-dramas, but this one is in the middle of the pack.This wildly popular series (20 episodes, 60 minutes each) is about a man who is trained from birth to seek revenge against the government officials who ordered the assassination of his father during a secret mission.  First and foremost, the script is as dumb as a bag of bricks, with plotholes up the wazoo.  One can only laugh at the preposterousness of it all.  For example, the hard-nosed guardian of the protagonist can seemingly pose as any random employee and immediately gain access to highly secure areas near high profile officials.  None of the security protocols are even remotely effective.  (It makes the latter seasons of ""24"" seem like the posterchild for realism.)  And that's not all, because the character decision-making at times makes no sense and there are absurd contrivances peppered throughout.Despite its incompetence, however, this series is inexplicably fun to watch.  It moves at a brisk pace, has a likeable cast, and shifts between genres to hold attention.  The action is pretty good and there are a few respectable dramatic moments during the later episodes.  There is also one really cool scene in a bathroom involving mirrors.  The lead actor (Min-ho Lee) is given the opportunity to display his acting chops thru a variety of emotions, and he's definitely someone to look out for in the future.",3,"Poorly written, watchable fluff",1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,1389,"['love', 'K-dramas', 'one', 'middle', 'pack.This', 'wildly', 'popular', 'series', '20', 'episodes', '60', 'minutes', 'man', 'who', 'trained', 'birth', 'seek', 'revenge', 'government', 'officials', 'who', 'ordered', 'assassination', 'father', 'secret', 'mission', 'First', 'foremost', 'script', 'as', 'dumb', 'bag', 'bricks', 'plotholes', 'wazoo', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'laugh', 'preposterousness', 'example', 'hard-nosed', 'guardian', 'protagonist', 'can', 'seemingly', 'pose', 'random', 'employee', 'immediately', 'gain', 'access', 'highly', 'secure', 'areas', 'high', 'profile', 'officials', 'None', 'security', 'protocols', 'are', 'even', 'remotely', 'effective', 'latter', 'seasons', '24', 'seem', 'posterchild', 'realism', 'not', 'character', 'decision-making', 'times', 'sense', 'are', 'absurd', 'contrivances', 'peppered', 'throughout.Despite', 'incompetence', 'however', 'series', 'inexplicably', 'fun', 'watch', 'brisk', 'pace', 'likeable', 'cast', 'shifts', 'genres', 'hold', 'attention', 'action', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'few', 'respectable', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'later', 'episodes', 'also', 'one', 'really', 'cool', 'scene', 'bathroom', 'involving', 'mirrors', 'lead', 'actor', 'Min-ho', 'Lee', 'given', 'opportunity', 'display', 'acting', 'chops', 'variety', 'emotions', 'definitely', 'someone', 'look', 'out', 'future']",City Hunter

I agree that the end could be confusing.  After reading the reviews, however, I was prepared for an odd ending.  I also looked up the directors explanation and it made perfect sense.  It also helps to think of the City Hunter as a comic book character.  I compared it to movies made from Marvel comics and it helped make more sense of the end.If I had one complaint it would be that they sort of dropped the love story about four hours from the end.

1505947,AYG1U47VFZ165,B005ZTGRMG,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[28, 31]","One trait distinguishing a `good' television show from an `exceptional' one is that the story never takes its audience for granted.  In other words, the show-runners take care to craft a premise and characters worthy of being followed from week to week, from episode to episode, in order to see where it's all going.  The writers understand that good drama requires an investment on the part of those watching - an investment of time, of effort - and, consequently, they take care to create a kind of internal mythology - a background from which characters and events spring.  From there, the sky's the limit as the audience grows to care more and more about the lives of these fictional people in the show.  Otherwise, one program is no different from any other, but, thankfully, CITY HUNTER stands out as quality programming but together by folks who care enough about their audience to make sure every episode is the best it could be.Like some of the best programs, CITY HUNTER relies on an idea somewhat larger-than-life.  After all, this isn't `reality television'; it's quality drama, and every great drama needs a great conflict at its core.  In 1983, terrorists strike at the South Korean government, causing five (South) Korean politicians to band together and plot a secret mission: they send a 21-man commando team on a daring assignment into North Korea to ""take out"" the men behind the terrorists.  However, when `the Five' receive word that their President will prosecute anyone who sanctions retaliation against the North, they instead conspire to have their elite team assassinated before they can leave enemy territory.  One man, Jin-pyo (played by Kim Sang-Joong), survives; and he swears to avenge his fallen comrades by murdering the five politicians responsible for planning the raid, ordering their deaths, and covering it all up.  In a curious development (that never gets fully explained until the last set of plot twists are revealed), Jin-pyo kidnaps his dead partner's newborn son, Yoon-sung (played by newcomer Lee Min-Ho), and raises him as his own, teaching him how to be a lethal killer in order to extract his revenge on `the Five.'  Twenty-eight years later, Jin-pyo and Yoon-sung return to South Korea to avenge the fallen soldiers.There's plenty to like about CITY HUNTER.  The first hour of the twenty episodes is one terrific set-up, and, in some ways, it reminded me of another television favorite of mine (Fox TV's 24, with Kiefer Sutherland as Jack Bauer).  There's terrorism, deaths, politics, and the military all thrown into a heavy, fast-paced yarn that lays the foundation for the mythology of events yet to come.  Jin-pyo escapes to Thailand, with the young boy in tow, and, once there, he establishes himself as an international smuggler in order to amass a small fortune that will be needed for his grand scheme of revenge.  Yoon-sung's youth is heavily abbreviated - we're basically given snippets and vignettes of his physical and mental training - but, eventually, he grows into manhood and accepts his father's mission as his own.  As the events unfold, Yoon-sung decides he no longer wishes the deaths of `the Five' but instead wants to have their lives ruined publicly.  Jin-pyo's bloodlust forces him to join his adopted son in South Korea, and the two of them remain at odds throughout much of the program's run.  Needless to say, these two opposing forces for change are set to collide in a potentially bloody and brutal way, and the last episode of the show still manages to breathe life into the plot with some unpredictable tension.  In short, CITY HUNTER is one wild ride through the themes of betrayal, commitment, and redemption.To my surprise, there's plenty more to admire about CITY HUNTER.  While Gotham City had Batman, Seoul has its City Hunter (Yoon-sung under a short black mask), and he's out to rid the city of its villains.  But what starts out similar to a strongly cinematic `Batman Begins'-type story quickly evolves into something vastly more complicated by the relationships.  Yoon-sung meets and, despite Jin-pyo's demands, falls in love with a Presidential bodyguard, Kim Nana (played by the lovely Park Min Young, who somehow manages to steal every scene she's in).  Also, Bae Shik Joong (played memorably by Kim Sang Ho) soon joins Yoon-sung in South Korea, kinda/sorta serving as Yoon-sung's butler, chef, and general man-about-town.  Shik Joong is also the source of much comic relief throughout the program's run; while some of the shtick is a more than a bit predictable, there are moments of pure comedy magic, such as when he spends the better part of ""babysitting"" a captured thug by reading to the man from a self-help of emotional improvement.  As the audience is drawn further and further into the story, other characters - the IT department from the Presidential compound; Yoon-sung's long lost mother; local police detectives; etc. - surface to drive the constantly shifting alliances into further treachery.  Thankfully, the show is never all gunplay, car chases, and fisticuffs (though there are plenty of those!); it's a wonderful mix of action and character that all lead to an explosive climax that'll change everyone's life forever.Also, the show boasts some very fine production quality.  Editing is swift, and locations are smartly used in ways that advance the story and add to some of the show's central mystery.  The writing is top notch, though there are a few relationships that perhaps relied too heavily on `coincidence' than they do organic growth.  The score is particularly good, though it occasionally relied too much on the same `pop songs' that serve as an undercurrent to Yoon-sung and Kim Nana's on-again-off-again romantic relationship.  Still, it's all handled with appealing professionalism.  And it's only `television', after all, so it's easy for forgive those excesses, sit back, and enjoy the tiny spectacle that is CITY HUNTER.As TV audiences around the world go, there is plenty of potential for CITY HUNTER to be successful beyond Korea.  As a matter of fact, US television is often seeking properties from other countries (there have been a handful of properties from the BBC that have received Americanized remakes for stateside broadcast, both theatrically and on television); I'd love to see some US-based production company grab up the rights to do a US version of CITY HUNTER.  The story has plenty of layers - LOST, for example, prided itself on exploring fascinating coincidences within the relationships of its characters, and CITY HUNTER is no different - and I could definitely get excited to learn if a remake was in the wings.  Not everything was perfect, but there was more than enough to keep my interest, to hang with the story, to want to know more about where these people were heading and to stay for the ride until we reached that destination.For the record, this was my first exploration of a televised Korean drama, and I certainly hope that it won't be my last.  As I mentioned at the outset of this review, audiences flock to quality dramas, and I think CITY HUNTER had plenty to offer.Highest recommendationIn the interests of fairness, I'm happy to disclose that the kind folks at YA Entertainment provided me with a screener DVD copy for the purpose of completing this review.",5,Korean Drama Proves CITY HUNTER A Force To Be Reckoned With!,1323907200,"12

City Hunter is the best, by far most exciting drama ever to come out of Korea (along with Protect the boss)---except! The ending fizzled out by leaving the audience very confused, so that the producer, director, and even Lee Min Ho had to publicly explain what happened--for those of you who regularly watch Korean dramas: When has that happened before?I am aware that some people liked the ending, but they were clearly in the minority. (I'm speaking of the Korean TV watching audience).And yes, I understood the ending after they explained it, but the problem is, it doesn't fit the drama.Protect the Boss, the best comedy romance to ever come out of Korea---so good! aired right after City Hunter, was originally 16 episodes, but after they saw the negative reaction to City Hunter, they quickly added two more episodes to make it 18 so they could change the ending.I would describe the endings I'm complaining about as writers and directors trying to be 'artsy', and instead, just being confusing.SPOILER ALERT!!! Lee Min Ho's character spent the entire drama being forced by his stepfather to hunt down his 'real' fathers' enemies (5 in all), and hopefully, kill them. So he did his stepfathers' bidding, all the while complaining that all he really wanted was a normal life-to settle down with the woman he loves, have a family, etc....AND-find his long lost mother. Understand-he spends the ENTIRE drama longing for these two things. He also tells the woman he loves SO much!-to be patient just a while longer until the revenge is all over, and they can live happily ever after.So what does he do when it's finally over? He packs his elderly mother, his girl, and his servant off to NY to live-where they know nobody, and don't speak english-and decides he's going to stay in Seoul and continue being City Hunter.Who's he going to hunt? We don't know. Will he still wear a mask and skulk around corners? We don't know.Does he even care about his girlfriend? We don't know that either.The producer initially said that the only thing we NEEDED to know was that he was still alive.I don't normally approve of spoilers, but in this case, I'm utterly and completely baffled by so many 5 star reviews. Are this many people really unable to see that the ending doesn't fit the drama? Do this many reviewers really not mind such a huge build-up in the romance fizzling out to nothing with no explanation?I'd like to add something else, just because I think it's interesting: like some of you, I follow the volunteer subbers of Kdramas while they are showing on TV. (There are professionals who sometimes sub for companies who sell these, but I know very little about them.) I can't (and wouldn't give you the website(s) where I follow the volunteers, here on Amazon, so it won't do any good to ask.) They are often subbed by volunteer teams from all over the world.When a drama is good, the teams usually take a couple of days to sub each episode, around 3-4 days for 2 episodes. That is fast, considering the amount of dialog in each episode. If a drama isn't so good, the teams can take as long as a week or more to sub one episode.This drama was subbed in 27 languages, and the English language team alone (again, from all over the world) had 50 or more subbers, many segmenters, many moderators, etc., etc.....the total people on this eng. team was HUGE. They called themselves the 'Pervert Team' because Lee Min Ho is so HOT! in this drama. Sizzling.Each episode was so exciting that the team would finish subbing it in HOURS! Very unusual.The last episode-they slowed way down.I'm not advising you not to buy this, because as you can see, the majority of people liked it (loved it) in spite of the ending.I have bought and enjoyed quite a few Kdramas that had controversial, less than happy endings, sometimes shocking bad endings, and I still enjoy them.",2,What the heck?!,1324080000,"12 17, 2011",2011,3908,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'asian', 'dramas', 'own', 'lot', 'City', 'Hunter', 'best', 'far', 'most', 'exciting', 'drama', 'ever', 'come', 'Korea', 'Protect', 'boss', '-except', 'ending', 'fizzled', 'out', 'leaving', 'audience', 'very', 'confused', 'producer', 'director', 'even', 'Lee', 'Min', 'Ho', 'had', 'publicly', 'explain', 'what', 'happened', 'who', 'regularly', 'watch', 'Korean', 'dramas', 'When', 'happened', 'am', 'aware', 'people', 'liked', 'ending', 'were', 'clearly', 'minority', ""'m"", 'speaking', 'Korean', 'TV', 'watching', 'audience', 'yes', 'understood', 'ending', 'explained', 'problem', ""n't"", 'fit', 'drama.Protect', 'Boss', 'best', 'comedy', 'romance', 'ever', 'come', 'Korea', '-so', 'good', 'aired', 'right', 'City', 'Hunter', 'was', 'originally', '16', 'episodes', 'saw', 'negative', 'reaction', 'City', 'Hunter', 'quickly', 'added', 'two', 'more', 'episodes', 'make', '18', 'could', 'change', 'ending.I', 'would', 'describe', 'endings', ""'m"", 'complaining', 'writers', 'directors', 'trying', 'be', ""'artsy"", 'instead', 'just', 'being', 'confusing.SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'Lee', 'Min', 'Ho', 'character', 'spent', 'entire', 'drama', 'being', 'forced', 'stepfather', 'hunt', 'down', ""'real"", 'fathers', 'enemies', '5', 'hopefully', 'kill', 'did', 'stepfathers', 'bidding', 'while', 'complaining', 'really', 'wanted', 'was', 'normal', 'life-to', 'settle', 'down', 'woman', 'have', 'family', 'etc', '.AND-find', 'long', 'lost', 'mother', 'Understand-he', 'ENTIRE', 'drama', 'longing', 'two', 'things', 'also', 'woman', 'SO', 'much', '-to', 'be', 'patient', 'just', 'while', 'longer', 'revenge', 'can', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.So', 'what', 'do', 'when', 'finally', 'elderly', 'mother', 'girl', 'servant', 'NY', 'live-where', 'know', 'nobody', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'english-and', 'decides', 'going', 'stay', 'Seoul', 'continue', 'being', 'City', 'Hunter.Who', 'going', 'hunt', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Will', 'still', 'wear', 'mask', 'skulk', 'corners', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.Does', 'even', 'care', 'girlfriend', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'either.The', 'producer', 'initially', 'said', 'only', 'thing', 'NEEDED', 'know', 'was', 'was', 'still', 'alive.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'approve', 'spoilers', 'case', ""'m"", 'utterly', 'completely', 'baffled', 'so', 'many', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'Are', 'many', 'people', 'really', 'unable', 'see', 'ending', ""n't"", 'fit', 'drama', 'Do', 'many', 'reviewers', 'really', 'not', 'mind', 'such', 'huge', 'build-up', 'romance', 'fizzling', 'out', 'nothing', 'explanation', ""'d"", 'like', 'add', 'something', 'else', 'just', 'think', 'interesting', 'follow', 'volunteer', 'subbers', 'Kdramas', 'are', 'showing', 'TV', 'are', 'professionals', 'who', 'sometimes', 'sub', 'companies', 'who', 'sell', 'know', 'very', 'little', 'ca', ""n't"", 'would', ""n't"", 'give', 'website', 's', 'where', 'follow', 'volunteers', 'here', 'Amazon', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'good', 'ask', 'are', 'often', 'subbed', 'volunteer', 'teams', 'world.When', 'drama', 'good', 'teams', 'usually', 'take', 'couple', 'days', 'sub', 'episode', '3-4', 'days', '2', 'episodes', 'fast', 'considering', 'amount', 'dialog', 'episode', 'drama', ""n't"", 'so', 'good', 'teams', 'can', 'take', 'as', 'long', 'week', 'more', 'sub', 'one', 'episode.This', 'drama', 'was', 'subbed', '27', 'languages', 'English', 'language', 'team', 'alone', 'again', 'world', 'had', '50', 'more', 'subbers', 'many', 'segmenters', 'many', 'moderators', 'etc.', 'etc', '..the', 'total', 'people', 'eng', 'team', 'was', 'HUGE', 'called', ""'Pervert"", 'Team', 'Lee', 'Min', 'Ho', 'so', 'HOT', 'drama', 'Sizzling.Each', 'episode', 'was', 'so', 'exciting', 'team', 'would', 'finish', 'subbing', 'HOURS', 'Very', 'unusual.The', 'last', 'episode-they', 'slowed', 'way', 'down.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'advising', 'not', 'buy', 'can', 'see', 'majority', 'people', 'liked', 'loved', 'spite', 'ending.I', 'have', 'bought', 'enjoyed', 'quite', 'few', 'Kdramas', 'had', 'controversial', 'less', 'happy', 'endings', 'sometimes', 'shocking', 'bad', 'endings', 'still', 'enjoy']",City Hunter

1505952,AAW58LG72PG7I,B005ZTGRMG,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[1, 1]","CITY HUNTER takes the dramatic and comedic talents of Lee Min Ho to create a myth of a Korean Robin Hood who stands up for the little guy against an entrenched government corruption that begins at the very highest level. Ostensibly a revenge film, CITY HUNTER explores the conflicting need for revenge by the oppressed against the inevitability of collateral damage to the innocent. Twenty-eight years ago a squad of twenty-one heroic South Korean commandos infiltrate a North Korean compound only to be betrayed by their own superiors who tried too late to scrub their mission. One of the twenty-one survives and vows vengeance on those five superiors, thus setting in motion the plot driving a series of twenty episodes. This survivor kidnaps the baby of one of the fallen others and raises him as a tool of that vengeance. This baby grows up to be Lee Min ho and the charm of the film resides in a complex web of overlapping emotions. At what point does the blind need for revenge morph into the very sort of evil that caused the need for this revenge in the first place? CITY HUNTER takes us into the slowly expanding morality of a man who can no longer view evil in black and white terms.  Along the way he encounters others who think as he does, including the henchman of his kidnapper-father who is similarly forced to re-evaluate loyalty to a man against reverence to humanity. As with many Korean dramas, there is plenty of romance with the Handsome Man (Ho) and a Beautiful Woman (Park Min Young), both of whom bicker, fall in love, quarrel, and predictably reconcile. There are numerous subplots that swerve in and out of broad farce and snickering sexual non-innuendos. In the world of current Korean drama, passion and lust exist only on the outer fringes of the script. Despite the very broad canvas of politics, intrigue, tear-filled romance, farce, and the martial arts, CITY HUNTER manages to engage the viewer sufficiently well to last for the full run of twenty episodes.",5,Behind the Myth,1396656000,"04 5, 2014",2014,1990,"['CITY', 'HUNTER', 'dramatic', 'comedic', 'talents', 'Lee', 'Min', 'Ho', 'create', 'myth', 'Korean', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'who', 'up', 'little', 'guy', 'entrenched', 'government', 'corruption', 'very', 'highest', 'level', 'Ostensibly', 'revenge', 'film', 'CITY', 'HUNTER', 'conflicting', 'need', 'revenge', 'oppressed', 'inevitability', 'collateral', 'damage', 'innocent', 'Twenty-eight', 'years', 'squad', 'twenty-one', 'heroic', 'South', 'Korean', 'commandos', 'infiltrate', 'North', 'Korean', 'compound', 'only', 'be', 'betrayed', 'own', 'superiors', 'who', 'tried', 'too', 'late', 'scrub', 'mission', 'One', 'twenty-one', 'survives', 'vows', 'vengeance', 'five', 'superiors', 'thus', 'setting', 'motion', 'plot', 'driving', 'series', 'twenty', 'episodes', 'survivor', 'baby', 'one', 'fallen', 'others', 'tool', 'vengeance', 'baby', 'up', 'be', 'Lee', 'Min', 'ho', 'charm', 'film', 'resides', 'complex', 'web', 'overlapping', 'emotions', 'what', 'point', 'blind', 'need', 'revenge', 'morph', 'very', 'sort', 'evil', 'caused', 'need', 'revenge', 'first', 'place', 'CITY', 'HUNTER', 'slowly', 'expanding', 'morality', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'view', 'evil', 'black', 'white', 'terms', 'way', 'others', 'who', 'think', 'including', 'henchman', 'kidnapper-father', 'who', 'similarly', 'forced', 're-evaluate', 'loyalty', 'man', 'reverence', 'humanity', 'many', 'Korean', 'dramas', 'plenty', 'romance', 'Handsome', 'Man', 'Ho', 'Beautiful', 'Woman', 'Park', 'Min', 'Young', 'whom', 'bicker', 'fall', 'love', 'quarrel', 'predictably', 'reconcile', 'are', 'numerous', 'subplots', 'swerve', 'broad', 'farce', 'snickering', 'sexual', 'non-innuendos', 'world', 'current', 'Korean', 'drama', 'passion', 'lust', 'exist', 'only', 'outer', 'fringes', 'script', 'very', 'broad', 'canvas', 'politics', 'intrigue', 'tear-filled', 'romance', 'farce', 'martial', 'arts', 'CITY', 'HUNTER', 'engage', 'viewer', 'sufficiently', 'well', 'last', 'full', 'run', 'twenty', 'episodes']",City Hunter

It's unlike most K-Dramas because it's grittier, extremely intense, and loaded with lots of ongoing action.  Yes, there is still romance and bits of comedy in it, but City Hunter truly stands out from most K-Dramas.  From the beginning you are taken on a roller coaster with so many twists and turns.  I was stressed out through the entire series, fearful of what was going to happen next for the City Hunter.  Would he get caught?  Would he die?  Why were people getting in his way?  I even found myself shouting, ""GET OUTTA THERE!""Here is the premise of the story:  In 1983, terrorists strike the South Korean government causing FIVE South Korean politicians to band together and plot a secret mission.  The mission is to send a 21-man commando team into North Korea to eliminate the men behind the terrorists attack. However, things go wrong when THE FIVE receive word that their President will prosecute anyone who sanctions retaliation against the North.  Together, they instead conspire to have their elite team assassinated before they can leave enemy territory. (Nice, huh!) One man, Jin-pyo (played by Kim Sang-Joong), survives.  After watching his men, including his best friend, being gunned down, he swears to avenge his fallen comrades by murdering the five politicians responsible for planning the raid, ordering the men's deaths, and covering it all up. Jin-pyo then kidnaps his dead partner's newborn son, Yoon-sung (played by talented Lee Min-Ho from Boys Over Flowers), and raises him as his own, training him to be a lethal killer in order to extract his revenge on THE FIVE.  Twenty-eight years later, Jin-pyo and Yoon-sung return to South Korea to avenge the fallen soldiers.  Yoon-sung soon finds more than he bargained for and that you really can't trust anyone around you.  There is terrorism, deaths, politics, and the military wrapped in this drama series.  Yoon-sung is skilled at what he does.  I loved his martial arts moves, his ability to always be a step ahead, and how he used his charm, money, and looks to seduce those around him.  Actor Lee Min-Ho does an EXCELLENT job as the City Hunter.  You feel his pain, determination, and need to complete the task no matter the cost.  His foster father was great, too.  He is so cruel and fueled by revenge.  Soon the two clash because the City Hunter wants to destroy THE FIVE's lives by ruining their picture perfect images to the public while Jin-pyo wants to end their lives permanently.  Lee Joon-Hyuk was fantastic as prosecutor Young-ju.  He stressed me out the most because he was a force to be reckoned with; pursuing the City Hunter to the point of obsession. Even the cook/butler, Bae Shik Joong (played by Kim Sang Ho) did a good job adding comic relief here and there.  I loved his loyalty to Yoon-sung.  It was a little hard for me to swallow Kim Nana (played by Park Min-young) as a presidential bodyguard.  She looked to delicate and often got on my nerves.  She wasn't bad but sometimes I wanted her to be quiet instead of always bothering the City Hunter.This is a FANTASTIC K-Drama.  Highly recommend it!

It cements Lee Min Ho as MAJOR movie star - I personally would be upset to see some Hollywood remake of this WITHOUT him.Definitely recommend this!",5,Notes on City Hunter.,1350864000,"10 22, 2012",2012,558,"['Lee', 'Min', 'Ho', 'shines', 'here', 'SOOOO', 'much', 'better', 'bratty', 'rich', 'snot', 'played', 'Boys', 'Over', 'Flowers', 'NOT', 'fav', 'manga/anime/Kdrama', 'mainly', 'ya', 'know', 'Kim', 'Hyun', 'Joong', 'NOT', 'getting', 'girl', 'digress', '.This', 'BTW', 'remake', 'Japanese', 'manga/anime', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'made', 'movie', 'ago', 'LOL', 'abrubt', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'badly', 'just', 'too', 'glossed', 'have', 'criticisms', 'Lee', 'Min', 'Ho', 'MAJOR', 'movie', 'star', 'personally', 'would', 'be', 'upset', 'see', 'Hollywood', 'remake', 'WITHOUT', 'him.Definitely', 'recommend']",City Hunter
