Burton and Randy are just excellent, great voices, and backed with an excellent group of musicians for that memorable evening.

1029804,A1TP2RW7KDI5AZ,B000JVT2AE,"John Werner ""JWW""","[1, 2]","As a grade-schooler I was exposed to music quite a bit because I had an older sister.  AM radio was still king and in the years following the British Invasion there were several other bands than made an impression on my budding penchant for loving music.  One of those bands was The Guess Who.  At the time I didn't even know who was in the group like I did for those fantastic Brit bands, but I knew it was good music that I liked. Probably around the fifth or sixth grade I purchased a best of The Guess Who on RCA records.  I wore it out, loved it.Fast forward about 35 years I have found this great DVD.  I've got two DVD concerts (one is dupped from VHS-HiFi) of The Guess Who.  The two concerts I have are really nice, the first one was an 80's reunion sponsored by Molson I think and the second was like late 90's or so that was actually made for DVD.  They're both definitely good and worth having with the later being the best for obvious quality reasons.  So, here's yet another Guess Who DVD so what does it offer?  It is not like the others due to the fact it was probably staged with being a DVD in mind.  It's intimate making it different, but the biggest difference is the fact it's stripped down to Bachman and Cummings.  These two, obviously, were the heart and soul of The Guess Who and they've both had careers outside with Bachman achieving major success with Bachman Turner Overdrive.  This DVD explores all of that plus a few of the influences each man brought to the table.  The combination is pure gold and is wonderfully realized in the intimate setting.This DVD was actually made more for TV than being an actual DVD concert, but that really isn't a problem unless one dwells on the fact that some of the songs are truncated (pretty tastefully I'd say).  One point I'd like to make is the opening number, ""American Woman"", is done in an acoustic arrangement that is not unlike ""Hotel California"" from that well known other band's reunion that was only suppose to happen if...you know.  Well, it is pure genius and makes this song that has been heard only a few times short of a number only an accountant could related to fresh and invigorated.  Talent transcends age and actually in some cases improves, this is what I'm seeing and hearing here and if you had a predilection as I did to love The Guess Who it's a no-brainer.  I'd say even if you didn't particularly think you liked The Guess Who, perhaps, you should give this concert a chance.  It's a rare magic of blending the right setting with the right performers, really fun plus it sounds great.  I guess I highly recommend it for going against conventional logic and working very well indeed.",5,Burton & Cummings Play Intimately...A Welcome Return.,1285891200,"10 1, 2010",2010,2677,"['grade-schooler', 'was', 'exposed', 'music', 'quite', 'bit', 'had', 'older', 'sister', 'AM', 'radio', 'was', 'still', 'king', 'years', 'following', 'British', 'Invasion', 'were', 'several', 'other', 'bands', 'made', 'impression', 'budding', 'penchant', 'loving', 'music', 'One', 'bands', 'was', 'Guess', 'Who', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'who', 'was', 'group', 'did', 'fantastic', 'Brit', 'bands', 'knew', 'was', 'good', 'music', 'liked', 'Probably', 'fifth', 'sixth', 'grade', 'purchased', 'best', 'Guess', 'Who', 'RCA', 'records', 'wore', 'out', 'loved', 'it.Fast', 'forward', '35', 'years', 'have', 'found', 'great', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'got', 'two', 'DVD', 'concerts', 'one', 'dupped', 'VHS-HiFi', 'Guess', 'Who', 'two', 'concerts', 'have', 'are', 'really', 'nice', 'first', 'one', 'was', '80', 'reunion', 'sponsored', 'Molson', 'think', 'second', 'was', 'like', 'late', '90', 'so', 'was', 'actually', 'made', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'definitely', 'good', 'worth', 'having', 'later', 'being', 'best', 'obvious', 'quality', 'reasons', 'So', 'here', 'yet', 'Guess', 'Who', 'DVD', 'what', 'offer', 'not', 'others', 'due', 'fact', 'was', 'probably', 'staged', 'being', 'DVD', 'mind', 'intimate', 'making', 'different', 'biggest', 'difference', 'fact', 'stripped', 'down', 'Bachman', 'Cummings', 'two', 'obviously', 'were', 'heart', 'soul', 'Guess', 'Who', ""'ve"", 'had', 'careers', 'Bachman', 'achieving', 'major', 'success', 'Bachman', 'Turner', 'Overdrive', 'DVD', 'few', 'influences', 'man', 'brought', 'table', 'combination', 'pure', 'gold', 'wonderfully', 'realized', 'intimate', 'setting.This', 'DVD', 'was', 'actually', 'made', 'more', 'TV', 'being', 'actual', 'DVD', 'concert', 'really', ""n't"", 'problem', 'one', 'dwells', 'fact', 'songs', 'are', 'truncated', 'pretty', 'tastefully', ""'d"", 'say', 'One', 'point', ""'d"", 'like', 'make', 'opening', 'number', 'American', 'Woman', 'done', 'acoustic', 'arrangement', 'not', 'Hotel', 'California', 'well', 'known', 'other', 'band', 'reunion', 'was', 'only', 'suppose', 'happen', 'know', 'Well', 'pure', 'genius', 'song', 'been', 'heard', 'only', 'few', 'times', 'short', 'number', 'only', 'accountant', 'could', 'related', 'fresh', 'invigorated', 'Talent', 'age', 'actually', 'cases', 'improves', 'what', ""'m"", 'seeing', 'hearing', 'here', 'had', 'predilection', 'did', 'love', 'Guess', 'Who', 'no-brainer', ""'d"", 'say', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'think', 'liked', 'Guess', 'Who', 'perhaps', 'should', 'give', 'concert', 'chance', 'rare', 'magic', 'blending', 'right', 'setting', 'right', 'performers', 'really', 'fun', 'great', 'guess', 'highly', 'recommend', 'going', 'conventional', 'logic', 'working', 'very', 'well', 'indeed']",N/A

I was tempted but passed. I recently was inclined to check this out after viewing the Bachman & Turner DVDLive at the Roseland Ballroom NYC [Blu-ray] as I wanted more of Randy Bachman to view. This program was great from the start and gets better and better.... goodness the program firstly is filmed in a special set that is easy on the eyes, with great sound and Bachman is in fine voice and plays well...but the HUGE surprise was Burton Cummings. WOW ...his vocal on the classic Guess Who song ""Undone"" is not only impressive to my ears but Randy Bachman is seen mouthing WOW! as it concludes and rightfully so...Cummings is the true treasure on this DVD. Cummings plays piano, Drums, Guitar, a flute solo in the before mentioned ""Undone"" and sings with his multi octave and very unique voice ....in a way that had my jaded jaw dropping over and over.This isn't hype over substance...what we have are two brilliant songwriters and multi instrumentalists discussing the creation of iconic pop songs and performing them to a high HIGH standard... this is talent folks and class and to top it all off Randy plays a new song of his ""Our Leaves are Green Again"" which is easily one of the most beautiful marriages of melody and word I've heard in my half century of loving music.This is the equivalent of the old school masters showing how its truly done.

LeBaron ""Todd LeBaron""","[13, 13]","My only complaint about this CBC-TV special package is that too many of the songs performed during the program are not complete versions of the songs. Granted, it was only an hour-long special, but the full songs would have been preferred over some of the condensed versions that appear here. The alternative would have been to travel into Montreal on a Tuesday night to see whqat was already a sold-out show that I didn't find out about soon enough to get tickets for (unrestricted by the timing of a television special, I'm assuming we would have gotten the full songs). The good news is the extra stuff that didn't air on the show is very much worth the cost of this package: their version of Marvin gaye's ""Mercy Mercy Me"", the updated ""American Woman"" (which they so kindly included on their ""Jukebox"" CD) and a few other songs that made me wish the show had been a 90-minute special (or even two hours).
