First off, I will say that while the movie is great, funny and lovable, it didn't have that unique feel that the series had, that being said, don't get me wrong, it was excellent and was very close. The movie is easy to explain, a mysterious man (played by SNL's Tim Meadows) comes to the Stevens family and invites them to a uncharted island so they can have a small, peaceful vacation as a family. They agree and think that its just going to be fun in the sun but soon things begin going wrong and later, it turns out that they are actually on a reality TV show and there the stars. The movie is packed with MANY hilarious moments (provided mostly by Shia Labeauf and Christy Carlson Romano (who by the way, really outdoes herself in this film, excellent job Christy). What I really liked about the film, is that it includes MANY charectors that were in the series, even some that weren't featured in the series that much. Each charector gives a good presence and adds a uniqueness to the situations. The actings great, the plots exceptional and the result is excellent. I recommend this DVD and lets all hope that Disney releases season box sets for the Even Stevens series.",5,Great For The Whole Family,1132358400,"11 19, 2005",2005,1281,"['must', 'say', 'really', 'liked', 'Direct', 'TV', 'movie', 'hit', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'series', 'Even', 'Stevens', 'First', 'will', 'say', 'movie', 'great', 'funny', 'lovable', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'unique', 'feel', 'series', 'had', 'being', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'was', 'excellent', 'was', 'very', 'close', 'movie', 'easy', 'explain', 'mysterious', 'man', 'played', 'SNL', 'Tim', 'Meadows', 'Stevens', 'family', 'uncharted', 'island', 'can', 'have', 'small', 'peaceful', 'vacation', 'family', 'agree', 'think', 'just', 'going', 'be', 'fun', 'sun', 'soon', 'things', 'begin', 'going', 'wrong', 'later', 'out', 'are', 'actually', 'reality', 'TV', 'show', 'stars', 'movie', 'packed', 'MANY', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'provided', 'mostly', 'Shia', 'Labeauf', 'Christy', 'Carlson', 'Romano', 'who', 'way', 'really', 'film', 'excellent', 'job', 'Christy', 'What', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'MANY', 'charectors', 'were', 'series', 'even', 'were', ""n't"", 'featured', 'series', 'much', 'charector', 'good', 'presence', 'uniqueness', 'situations', 'actings', 'great', 'plots', 'exceptional', 'result', 'excellent', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'hope', 'Disney', 'season', 'box', 'sets', 'Even', 'Stevens', 'series']",N/A

The story involves the Stevens family being greeted by a travel agent and imforming them that they won a vacation to a island in the South Pacific. Louis, Ren and the rest of the family were enjoying their island paradise when little do they know that the agent is actually a TV producer who has duped the Stevens into appearing on a new reality show. Tim Meadows(Saturday Night Live) and Dave Coulier(Full House) also starring in this family comedy.

891150,A2LJKDPRVR907S,B0007US7CG,Lisa Siegel,"[11, 12]","This Disney Channel Original Movie basically follows the show that was on Disney Channel.  Since I was a fan of the show, I decided to watch the movie when it was on TV.  I found it highly enjoyable and just fun to watch.  All of the original characters are in it (even the characters who barely had any on-screen time during the series) and that to me is important, because a lot of the time, some of the characters from the series just don't show up in the movie.  I'm glad that wasn't the case with this.The plot was kind of silly, but that is just how the show was in general.  The Stevens family ""wins"" an all expense paid trip to an island that no one has ever heard of only to find out that they're on a reality TV show.I really liked how they wrapped up the school year in the first 15 minutes (Ren was graduating from junior high).Christy Carlson Romano (Ren Stevens) truly outdid herself in this movie.  She is hilarious and dramatic--both at the same time!  I really enjoyed her performance, especially when she was going mad running after Louis.  Totally unexpected from her character, but I really enjoyed it.  Shia LeBouf (Louis Stevens) was his usual silly self.  He and Beans (Steven Anthony Lawrence) caused mayem during the graduation, which was expected but I loved it nonetheless.  When the family was on the ""island"" I found him very enjoyable when he kept running after a squirrel (and then eventually running from Ren).  All in all, Shia shined in the movie.Tom Virtue and Donna Pescow (Steve and Eileen Stevens) were great.  Both are wonderful actors.Anyway, if you're a fan of Disney Channel and/or of Even Stevens the series, I highly recommend this movie to you!",5,Like a Long Even Stevens Episode...Only Better,1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,1689,"['Disney', 'Channel', 'Original', 'Movie', 'basically', 'show', 'was', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'was', 'fan', 'show', 'decided', 'watch', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'TV', 'found', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'just', 'fun', 'watch', 'original', 'characters', 'are', 'even', 'characters', 'who', 'barely', 'had', 'on-screen', 'time', 'series', 'important', 'lot', 'time', 'characters', 'series', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'this.The', 'plot', 'was', 'kind', 'silly', 'just', 'how', 'show', 'was', 'general', 'Stevens', 'family', 'wins', 'expense', 'paid', 'trip', 'island', 'one', 'ever', 'heard', 'only', 'find', 'out', ""'re"", 'reality', 'TV', 'show.I', 'really', 'liked', 'how', 'wrapped', 'up', 'school', 'year', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'Ren', 'was', 'graduating', 'junior', 'high', '.Christy', 'Carlson', 'Romano', 'Ren', 'Stevens', 'truly', 'outdid', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'dramatic', 'same', 'time', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'performance', 'especially', 'when', 'was', 'going', 'mad', 'running', 'Louis', 'Totally', 'unexpected', 'character', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Shia', 'LeBouf', 'Louis', 'Stevens', 'was', 'usual', 'silly', 'self', 'Beans', 'Steven', 'Anthony', 'Lawrence', 'caused', 'mayem', 'graduation', 'was', 'expected', 'loved', 'nonetheless', 'When', 'family', 'was', 'island', 'found', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'when', 'kept', 'running', 'squirrel', 'then', 'eventually', 'running', 'Ren', 'Shia', 'shined', 'movie.Tom', 'Virtue', 'Donna', 'Pescow', 'Steve', 'Eileen', 'Stevens', 'were', 'great', 'are', 'wonderful', 'actors.Anyway', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'and/or', 'Even', 'series', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie']",N/A

The show was hilarious, originally following the lives of two rival siblings, Louis (played briliantly by Shia LaBeouf) and Ren (rising star, Christy Carlson Romano) The show started to spread to all the other chartchers in the show, and most of the have noticable roles in this movie. Louis is a goof-ball, while Ren (being the complete oposite) is a well-respected straight A overachiever. The series hit its high in its 2002 episode, ""Influenza: The Musical"" which featured the cast memebers in very cool song and dance numbers. The movie premiered in July 2003, achieveing amazing reviews and millions of viewers. Disney is smart to release this one, becuase this is a must have for any DIsney fan. This movie ends the series on a high note, with Ren graduating middle school (in an episode didn't she say she was past 8th grade?), and Louis preparing for the Ultimate Summer Vacation, when an enthusiastic man shows up on their door. He tells the Stevens that they have won an all-expsense trip to an exotic island. But when the Stevens family arrive on the island with their annoying neighbor frined, they have no idea the rest of the world is watching them. They are now staring on the new show ""Family Fake-Out"", and their friends back home (who unknowingly sold them out) venture outto save them.
