500234,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B00000FELK,Anyechka,"[98, 107]","As a student of world religions, I found this four-part series, which I originally watched on television, to be packed full of great information from a wide variety of disciplines.  It traces the evolution of Christianity from its days as just another Jewish denomination to its final break into an entirely new faith, along with the evolution of the historical Jesus (admittedly a rather obscure figure, given that apart from Josephus, he isn't mentioned in any extrabiblical sources) into a figure of much greater importance (hence the title of the series).  A lot of programs about early Christianity tend to repeat the same old story over and over, but this series goes beyond what we already know to fill in all of the gaps.  After all, a lot of times what isn't said in the Bible is more telling than what actually is said.  Biblical literalists and those who believe the Bible to be absolutely inerrant probably won't be happy with some of these new reinterpretations, but what good is your faith if it can't stand up to some challenges?  One must have a pretty weak faith if it falls apart or feels threatened by new historical information, or modern-day schools of thought that don't adhere to an absolute black and white view of the Bible.  Isn't it better to become stronger in your faith by constantly re-examining and scrutinising what you believe in and forming your own independent beliefs?The series explores such topics as the journal of Perpetua, an early martyr, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the amazing books found at Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945 (it's criminal and heartbreaking how the mother of the boy who found them threw a couple of them into her kindling fire!), the differences between the four Gospels and how they each reflect their respective eras and locations (Mark starts out in a very Jewish vein and ends on a depressing note, while John is very anti-Jewish and paints the Jesus movement as much stronger and in control at the end), Constantine's conversion, Masada and Shimon Bar Kochba, the destruction of the Second Temple, how Christianity developed in the various places it travelled to in the region, and Jesus's true social class.  All in all, the history of Christianity's first few centuries is a fascinating and multi-faceted story.  It's a guarantee that everyone can learn something new by watching this.",5,A fascinating story,1193184000,"10 24, 2007",2007,2344,"['student', 'world', 'religions', 'found', 'four-part', 'series', 'originally', 'watched', 'television', 'be', 'packed', 'full', 'great', 'information', 'wide', 'variety', 'disciplines', 'evolution', 'Christianity', 'days', 'just', 'Jewish', 'denomination', 'final', 'break', 'entirely', 'new', 'faith', 'evolution', 'historical', 'Jesus', 'admittedly', 'rather', 'obscure', 'figure', 'given', 'apart', 'Josephus', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'extrabiblical', 'sources', 'figure', 'much', 'greater', 'importance', 'hence', 'title', 'series', 'lot', 'programs', 'early', 'Christianity', 'tend', 'repeat', 'same', 'old', 'story', 'series', 'what', 'already', 'know', 'fill', 'gaps', 'lot', 'times', 'what', ""n't"", 'said', 'Bible', 'more', 'telling', 'what', 'actually', 'said', 'Biblical', 'literalists', 'who', 'believe', 'Bible', 'be', 'absolutely', 'inerrant', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'happy', 'new', 'reinterpretations', 'what', 'good', 'faith', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'challenges', 'One', 'must', 'have', 'pretty', 'weak', 'faith', 'apart', 'feels', 'threatened', 'new', 'historical', 'information', 'modern-day', 'schools', 'thought', 'do', ""n't"", 'adhere', 'absolute', 'black', 'white', 'view', 'Bible', ""n't"", 'better', 'become', 'stronger', 'faith', 'constantly', 're-examining', 'scrutinising', 'what', 'believe', 'forming', 'own', 'independent', 'beliefs', 'series', 'such', 'topics', 'journal', 'Perpetua', 'early', 'martyr', 'Dead', 'Sea', 'Scrolls', 'amazing', 'books', 'found', 'Nag', 'Hammadi', 'Egypt', '1945', 'criminal', 'heartbreaking', 'how', 'mother', 'boy', 'who', 'found', 'threw', 'couple', 'kindling', 'fire', 'differences', 'four', 'Gospels', 'how', 'reflect', 'respective', 'eras', 'locations', 'Mark', 'out', 'very', 'Jewish', 'vein', 'depressing', 'note', 'John', 'very', 'anti-Jewish', 'Jesus', 'movement', 'as', 'much', 'stronger', 'control', 'end', 'Constantine', 'conversion', 'Masada', 'Shimon', 'Bar', 'Kochba', 'destruction', 'Second', 'Temple', 'how', 'Christianity', 'developed', 'various', 'places', 'travelled', 'region', 'Jesus', 'true', 'social', 'class', 'history', 'Christianity', 'first', 'few', 'centuries', 'fascinating', 'multi-faceted', 'story', 'guarantee', 'everyone', 'can', 'learn', 'something', 'new', 'watching']",From Jesus to Christ - The First Christians VHS

This series attempts to help us with the next step in understanding the forces evolved in creating the first Christians.I was very surprised to find so much new information presented in this series.  My original intent was to see what Elaine Pagels [author of ""The Gnostic Paul"" ISBN 1563380390] looks and sounds like.  I found a lot more treasure.Going beyond the institutionalized church of today we find some of the many elements that struggled to create the understanding we have today.  I was not totally aware that the different time periods of the gospels and location was so significant.  The second revolt of the Jews also known about was not emphasized as well as in this series.  The real positive impact of the series is that it sets a foundation for further investigation.There are several drawbacks in the series, all to do with presentation.  First it is a series of sound bites.  Some nice scenery and inspirational music surrounds little 15 second question and answer interviews.  The people that they interview contradict each other; this would be o.k.  if they weren't mixed up together.  One person says that there was no middle class just ""Have's and have not's.""  Then a second person comes in and says that the meeting was attended by all the middle class and not represented by the upper class or the lower class farmers.  The nature of what the people are thinking at the time is subject to the interpretation of the speaker with no supporting evidence (of course this may be due to the short time on the review.)In any event this will need repeated reviewing.

The story of Jesus told by theologists, historians and archeologists who completely disregard the main source, which is the Bible, and play at guessing what must have been the most probable explanation for the birth of the Christian faith.See this, the Romans only killed Jesus, because he must have been a threat to the Roman authority. This is not what I read in the Bible and nevertheless they don't explain -or even mention- the Bible's story. No mention of Pharisees nor Saducees... It would make the video too long, right.We could have heard the words of Jesus himself narrated but no. And I thought He was the main character in this story.No recreation of facts. And all that is said in each chapter of this series occupies no more than 2 pages (double spece). Slow reading, boring lectures from the professors.""We know very little about His life""... sure, and what little we know you don't even want to tell us. Don't even let us hear His words. Jesus explained who He was and the purpose of His coming. But this video ignores it.Conclusion: They tried to trivialize Jesus, stripping Him of everything appealing that we know from the Bible and they reduced Him to an ordinary Joe. History does not prove much, I know that, but neither rules out the wonderful facts narrated in the Bible. So, in the end, this story comes to nothing. Just because they didn't want to bring the Bible to the table. There's no way of knowing the real thing if it's not through the Bible, buddies. At least they could have told us what the Bible says, if only as a theory; it would be more interesting.Don't forget to read the bible, whether you believe it or not, at least it has explanations and a lot of weighty substance.Lord, these intellectuals sure don't know what they are talking about.

500237,A2JAQ6NTQRDIBU,B00000FELK,Carlos E. Rangel,"[56, 71]","This DVD presents mostly the points of views of several bible scholars. Most of the observations about how Christianity initially developed are acceptable, and some are very good; but most of the final commentaries are way off target.First, Constantine the Great did tell the Christian soldiers that, in a vision, he had been instructed to place a cipher of Christ (not exactly a cross, as they indicate in the DVD) on the shields of his soldiers, in order to win a crucial battle against Maxentius and to become the sole Roman emperor. But all these scholars appear to ignore that, at the same time, he had told the pagan soldiers that, in a visit to a sanctuary of Apollo in France, he also had a vision in which this pagan god had promised victory and long life to him; thus, it is evident that he was more of a shrewd politician than a true convert.Second, at the end of the DVD, the narrator says that, with the adoption of Christianity by Rome, some saw the fulfillment of the prophesy that ""the kingdom of the world would become the kingdom of God,"" or vice versa, and that now Jesus of Nazareth had become Jesus the Christ. Well, on one hand Saint Paul had started teaching extensively and in different terms about Christ more than two centuries before; and, on the other hand, Constantine stands for one of the most, if not the most corruptive person in the history of the Church, for now it was the Roman state who pulled many of the strings in the government of the Church, and, in general, authority in the Church became a matter not only of brotherly service, as Jesus taught, but of power and political influence.

Jackson,"[1, 7]","Note where Bible scholars interviewed for the program say, ""Jesus would have represented a kind of activist and resister in Pontius Pilate's experience that he had been dealing with for years, and with varying degrees of success and effectiveness, obviously. Jesus would have been a blip on the screen of Pontius Pilate, because the unrest and the uprisings were so common, part of daily life for the Roman administration of Judea, that Jesus would have been seen, I think, as very little out of the ordinary.""and""Now I don't for a moment think that Pilate would have been worried that Jesus could have challenged the power of the emperor. That's not the point. The point is, any challenge to Roman authority...any challenge to the peace of Rome would have been met with a swift and violent response.""This confirms Josephus' accounts as to what immediately happened to any person claiming to perform miracles in Roman Judea.Between 44 and 46 CE, one Theudas caused some consternation with what may have been a claim to be the Messiah:""It came to pass, while Fadus was procurator of Judea, that a certain charlatan, whose name was Theudas,  persuaded a great part of the people to take their effects with them, and follow him to the river Jordan; for he told them he was a prophet, and that he would, by his own command, divide the river, and afford them an easy passage over it. Many were deluded by his words. However, Fadus did not permit them to make any advantage of his wild attempt, but sent a troop of horsemen out against them. After falling upon them unexpectedly, they slew many of them, and took many of them alive. They also took Theudas alive, cut off his head, and carried it to Jerusalem."" -- [(Flavius Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 20.97-98]andThe Roman governor Festus, who was -according to recent research- in office from 58 until 60 CE, was confronted with another rebel:""Festus sent forces, both horsemen and footmen, to fall upon those that had been seduced by a certain impostor, who promised them deliverance and freedom from the miseries they were under, if they would but follow him as far as the wilderness. Accordingly, those forces that were sent destroyed both him that had deluded them, and those that were his followers also."" -- [Flavius Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 20.188]Yet the Bible scholars interviewed for this PBS Frontline program fail to explain why Pontius Pilate failed for three years to swiftly deal with the threat of Jesus when if it had been anyone other than Jesus, that threat to the Roman Peace would have been immediately dealt with three years earlier (see first embedded comment, and in the link provided fast-forward to 37:45 minutes in Part I of ""From Jesus to Christ: The First Christians"" for another Biblical scholar's account of how Roman governors in Judea IMMEDIATELY reacted towards PEACEFUL ""Messiahs"")!The PBS Frontline program also fails to explain the similar three-year inaction of the religious leaders in Jerusalem (and Galilee/Perea) to execute Jesus for blasphemy under the Law of Moses, AND why for the next 37 years (before the fall of Jerusalem) Roman and Jewish religious authorities are still refusing to put to death Jesus' disciples and all Jesus Sect members (excepting for three fluke cases: Saint Stephen and the two disciples named James. In the case of Saint Stephen, he was pointed out to the religious leaders of Jerusalem by foreign Jews from what is today Turkey, who were in town for Passover. The religious leaders of Jerusalem were pressed into the arrest and stoning of Stephen by ignorant foreign Jews, otherwise Stephen would not have been arrested in the first place. See first embedded comment to this review for how the two disciples named James died.)!In fact, in Acts 4:4 and Acts 5:18, the disciples were arrested twice by the Sanhedrin before the death of Stephen. Inexplicably, in both instances the Sanhedrin merely warned the disciples to keep their tongues quiet about Jesus, then released them!Note too that during Paul's three-year ""persecution"" of Jesus Sect members (33-36 AD), no real persecution is actually taking place in Judea (or Galilee for that matter, since the disciples are moving freely from Galilee to Judea and back), which must of exasperated the newly minted Pharisee. Obviously perplexed, and attempting to ""impress"" his superiors, Paul asks (see Acts 9) for a persecution mission to the gentile city of Damascus.Now the gentile rulers of the ""independent"" city states of Decapolis (where Damascus is located) didn't allow for the extradition of Jesus Sect subjects to Judea for stoning, so Paul is being sent on a wild goose mission and doesn't know it! In fact, it was on one such wild goose mission (to Damascus) that Jesus had enough with Paul and threw him off his high horse of ignorance. Jesus says to Paul, ""Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"" Note, Jesus only says this to the obstinate Paul. Jesus doesn't have to tell anyone else to cease persecuting his flock because no one else in Judea is! I bet you never thought about that?The Christian interpretation followed for 2,000 years on this subject is in such egregious and obvious error, that it is a true miracle that it wasn't debunked until now! Roman authorities and Jewish authorities KNEW Jesus was the Messiah, otherwise actions against Jesus (and after Jesus' death and resurrection) would have been immediate and violent for all Jesus Sect members involved.In fact, John 11 (45-55) implicitly tells us that long before Passion Week the priestly leadership of Jerusalem knew Jesus was the Messiah (how Christian theists missed this eye-opening passage from John is beyond explanation!):""45 Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, believed in him. 46 But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. 47 Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin.""What are we accomplishing?"" they asked. ""Here is this man performing many signs. 48 If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation.""49 Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, ""You know nothing at all! 50 You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.""51 He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, 52 and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one. 53 So from that day on they plotted to take his life.54 Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the people of Judea. Instead he withdrew to a region near the wilderness, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.55 When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover. 56 They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple courts they asked one another, ""What do you think? Isn't he coming to the festival at all?"" 57 But the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who found out where Jesus was should report it so that they might arrest him.""See where the High Priest Caiaphas tells his underlings, ""You know nothing at all!""? Caiaphas knows who Jesus is because the intelligence network he has within the Jesus camp (Rome and Herod Antipas also have their intelligence networks within the Jesus Sect camp, and the agents are reporting that Jesus is unlike the other deluded ""prophets"" they've dealt with before, that Jesus is really bringing back to life persons known to be dead and performing other miracles) is affirming that Jesus is the Messiah.Note the inexplicable description Caiaphas makes about Jesus: ""...he [Caiaphas] prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, 52 and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one. 53 So from that day on they plotted to take his life.""Now, if Jesus was merely considered by Caiaphas to be a deluded blaspheming ""Prophet"", then when Jesus died, that was it. Jesus would be forgotten. But notice, Caiaphas says about what Jesus' death would bring about, ""...that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, 52 and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one."" A deluded Jesus would die for blasphemy, not ""die for the Jewish nation"" as Caiaphas says.In other words, Caiaphas not only knew who Jesus was, he knew what Jesus was up to otherwise he would never have made such a blasphemous comment himself about Jesus' death ""bring[ing] them [the Jewish nation] together and make them one."" However, note that Caiaphas is under the misapprehension of Jesus' true mission, which is to die for man's sins. Caiaphas is still operating under the original Covenant God made with man (with the Jews), so he thinks Jesus's death will reconstitute an independent Israel.Now, the next week was Passion Sunday. What happened on Passion Sunday? Jesus arrives in Jerusalem with a large mob. This action was a direct attack on Roman rule in Judea, which put into motion Caiaphas' and Jesus' plan that Jesus must die.Also note Caiaphas' worries about Rome. Caiaphas would have been counting his blessings that Prefect Pontius Pilate hadn't already long ago arrested and executed Jesus for ""rebellion"". Caiaphas must have known though that it wasn't just three-years good luck that kept Pilate from doing his duty and arrest and execute Jesus, but that Pilate too obviously knew who Jesus was. But how long could Caiaphas expect Pilate to avert his eyes from Jesus' provocations? Caiaphas had to act, and the Passion Sunday procession was the obvious sign from God that it was time for Jesus to die.This passage from John's Gospel proves that Jewish religious authorities in Judea and Galilee (especially the high ranking authorities) knew who Jesus was.Another proof that the religious leaders of Jerusalem knew Jesus was the Messiah, and had no intention themselves of killing Him, was their failure to also arrest His disciples at Gethsemane. In order to operationalize Jesus' mission (as the religious leaders saw it) on Eathh, only the arrest of Jesus was necessary; His death would come at the hands of Pilate, not them, as proved by the three extralegal ""trials"" to come, proceedings that ruled out any form of punishment under the Law of Moses (Under the Law of Moses, trials could only take place later, during daylight hours.).This explains why John the Baptist refused to ministry in Judea, and ministry only in Antipas' jurisdiction of Perea (in order to question John, the Elders of Jerusalem had to travel to Perea to do so, because John refused to cross the Jordan River and enter Roman territory). Because John (although born in Judea) knew what would happen to him once he crossed the border into Judea with his disciples and followers: Arrest and execution by Roman authorities, yet Jesus was allowed by Pilate to come and go as He pleased!Since John the Baptist was preaching the Old Testament in Perea (Antipas' jurisdiction), there was no cause to arrest John for blasphemy and leading Jews astray. John was only arrested and executed by Antipas when John specifically railed against Antipas' marriage to his dead brother's wife, who was also his niece.The Gospels' narrative is so ludicrous, so obviously a forged narrative, a badly forged infantile narrative, that the only way it would have been accepted as true by anyone at the time of its release is if the narrative was known to be true already!The Gospels' narrative was known true, otherwise there would be no Christianity today.Let's perform a modern times analogy with the Roman Empire using a post World War II scenario where Germany won the war and rules the Western hemisphere:Germany has won World War II, and German governors rule the Western hemisphere, the Waffen SS being the equivalent of the Roman centurion.Though the war is over resistance to German occupation continues, including the French Resistance.Now, in France the leader of the French resistance and twelve lieutenants move openly about France for three years preaching rebellion and the German governor does nothing. After three years the leader of the French Resistance enters Paris with his twelve lieutenants and a mob and again the German governor refuses to arrest the thirteen, and roundup the mob.Finally the French mayor of Paris arrests the leader, but not the twelve lieutenants, and hands the leader over to the German governor who still doesn't want to execute the leader, but does after left no other option.Now, after the leader of the French Resistance is dead not only are the twelve lieutenants allowed to live under that particular German governor's remaining term of office, but aren't touched by the next nine German governors to take office. In fact, the French Resistance is increasing by tens of thousands each year and German authorities simply sit by and watch.Now when one of those French Resistance travels outside France to spread the word of the rebellion in France, he is believed because everyone KNOWS the otherwise ludicrous story he's telling is true. END OF ANALOGY.Now you can appreciate the reactions of any Roman subject when confronted with the Gospels' narrative of how Jesus and His disciples were treated by both Jewish and Roman authorities: Unbelievable, unless known to be true!You see, the New Testament narrative also has the next 9 Roman governors after Pilate also inexplicably refusing to put to death Jesus' disciples who are still performing ""rebellious"" miracles (others too besides the disciples are performing ""rebellious"" miracles) and attracting large crowds. The Jewish leaders are doing the same...actually protecting the Jesus Sect, where the sect is now tens of thousands strong in Jerusalem alone by the time of Paul's third trip back to the city in 61 AD (the original Greek texts says ""ten of thousands"", not ""thousands"". New Testament translators couldn't believe the high number, so they removed a zero!).The Gospels' failure to account for the inexplicable behaviors on the part of officials allowing Jesus to live three years beyond which others would have met their deaths, and equally inexplicable failure to destroy the Jesus Sect for the next thirty-seven years before the fall of Jerusalem, is understandable when one observes the precarious situation the new Jesus Sect found itself in. To openly proclaim in the Gospels and other books that found their way into the New Testament that Jewish (and Roman) officials knew Jesus was the Messiah would have forced those officials into actually persecuting the Jesus Sect in order to deflect such claims made in Jesus Sect literature. In other words, for forty years there was a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy towards the Jesus Sect!In closing, I would like to clear an issue that has perplexed New Testament scholarship for close to a century now, and that is the Testimonium Flavianum, the name given to the passage found in Book 18, Chapter 3, 3 of the ""Antiquities of the Jews"", in which the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus describes the condemnation and crucifixion of Jesus at the hands of the Roman authorities, specifically referring to Jesus with the following, ""He was [the] Christ.""It is this reference to Jesus as being ""the Christ"" (Messiah) that troubles New Testament scholars since we are told by the early Church Father Origen in his Commentary on Matthew (Book X, Chapter 17) that Josephus did not accept Jesus as Christ. Well, as my research above proves, Jewish officials in Judea and elsewhere did indeed believe Jesus to be the Messiah, though for political reasons kept that belief close to themselves.Josephus' family was wealthy, and his his father came from the priestly order of the Jehoiarib, which was the first of the 24 orders of priests in the Temple in Jerusalem. Therefore, Josephus would have been well aware of the intelligence reports the Sanhedrin received concerning Jesus' true nature, hence there would be no conflict with Josephus not only accepting Jesus as the Messiah, but knowing Jesus was the Messiah.Christian apologetics is finally dead.Christian verity is born.",3,A One-Dimensional Overview that Fails to Note the Contradictions

500241,ARJ2L3J5GPHRM,B00000FELK,"Doug D. Johnson ""Doug Johnson""","[15, 44]","The very first statements of this video is biased and bends facts.This statement is that the people who recorded the events of Christ's ministry on earth did not live during the time of Jesus therefore implying that the record cannot be accurate.Not true . . . many historians support the notion that the story of Christ's ministry were told either by people who witnessed the evens or recorded by people who interviewed people who witnessed them.The intent of this is to eliminate the Bible as a historical source. This may be success if the audience is not acquainted with the historical support for the bible, which if anyone cares to read about it, the Bible is the most reliable historical source ever found for events at this time period.Things get worse as this film goes on and I won't belabour the egregious errors committed.This film will be a comfort to those who want to ascribe to the current liberal view of Christ and Christianity.To those who have considered the evidence in a rational manner this video will be an affront to their intelligence.

Here were a bunch of know-it-all scholars, all of whom seemed to slant to the left and viewed Christianity as an engaging myth and Christ as a sort of socio-political hero. (Just look at the title, whereby it implies that Jesus was just a village carpenter who was deified after his death.) But as I progressed to the later parts, including the one about the composition of the Gospels, my interest was captured and I learned quite a bit. Yes, this film is strictly from a historical/anthropological perspective, and I don't think any religious viewpoints are represented. But even a believing Christian of any denomination (I happen to be a Catholic) could learn something from this video. But I stand firm on the absolute DULLNESS and monotony of the background music.Some of the comments made on this page distress me, and I would like to react to a few of them.To the reviewer who commented on how the gospels reveal that ""loving God there is no need of a church or clergymen"". I would respond to him that one can read anything into the gospel that one wants to, and one can twist it to conform to one's own pre-existing ideology. It is in age-old church tradition, and not in new-fangled re-interpretations of Christianity, that the truth is to be found.To Ian Noble, who referred to those of us who object to certain elements of this film as ""religious facatics"": I would caution him against casually bandying about such a strong epithet. Those who hold to traditional beliefs regarding Jesus Christ are not ""religious fanatics"".Fundamentalists and those who ""take the Bible literally"" are not the only ones who will object to certain elements of this film. I am a Catholic, and I disagreed with it in points. And to Riad from Sacramento: Why is it that traditional church beliefs about Jesus are ""filtered interpretations"" of the Bible, whereas secular interpretations are not?Finally, I wish people would stop thinking that there is some ""institutionalized Christian church"".

People acting as six year olds in elementary school having the classic playground argument on whether Santa Claus exists or not.  No, I'm not an atheist.  I took the long way around to discovering that I'm a believer in God, and Jesus Christ.  But I didn't just automatically adopt what others told me to think.  My search began sometime ago with an almost agnostic doubt, and although there is no absolute proof that Christ was anything more than a human being, and possibly historical figure, I have found my faith and will live with it, for that is what faith is...believing without proof.That being said, I found From Jesus to Christ: The First Christians to be a very good look into the ""historicity"" of Jesus and his original followers and how the early movement developed into a worldwide following.  Because there is so little true historical documentation besides sacred scripture, this program like so many similar efforts must make some conjecture based on the few historical things We Know occurred and are verifiable from other historical accounts (mostly from the Romans and Jews of the period).  The New Testament in and of itself has to be called into some doubt as far as an historical source because it simply contradicts itself at times.  Locations, events and who was there differ greatly from Mark to Matthew to Luke.  That is simple fact. Read your Bible. This program addresses that issue without demeaning the whole, I believe.The problem is, there are so many different belief systems today within modern Christianity, it would be impossible to get everybody on the same page as to what went down 2,000 years ago.  We can't agree on what happened last week.  And people have their own Santa belief system so when someone comes along and throws in cold hard facts, the egg nog goes a little off.I highly recommend this PBS documentary to anyone who is searching for some truth mixed with their reindeer. I'm not saying the show has it all right.  It doesn't convey or profess that it does.  But it offers some very good insight as to what may have happened and how difficult the culture of the time really (historically) was, and not how 19th and 20th century artists have painted it for us as children.While shining some light in dark corners, the beauty of From Jesus to Christ is that it portrays the mystery of the whole thing as just that:  Beautiful and mysterious.  That an empire that executed the leader of an insignificant band of his followers could eventually be dominated by their philosophy is at least an uncanny irony.  That God ""works in mysterious ways"", is an absolute truth.Watch and enjoy (and maybe learn), and don't let it ruin your day if you don't agree with everything portrayed within.

The conclusions appeared to be based on pure subjectivity.  I found myself over and over again asking ""What leads you to that conclusion?""  For instance, one speaker said ""Most historian think Jesus was born and raised in Nazareth.""  Not one piece of evidence was given to lead to a conclusion that Jesus was born in Nazareth, unless it was the fact that he was raised in Nazareth. Must one conclude Jesus was born in Nazareth, contrary to all the historical writings, simply because he was raised in Nazareth?  One speaker said the early church constructed language that John predicted the coming of Jesus so that the church could explain the relationship between the two.  The speaker gives no historical, archeological or linguistic evidence to support this conclusion.  One of the speakers inferred that the resurrection was added after the Gospel of Mark was written because the earliest version of Mark does not have any resurrection appearances.  But the earliest version of Mark ends with the empty tomb, which would appear to imply a resurrection - especially in light of Mark 8:31 where the resurrection is expressly foretold.  Additionally the Apostle Paul wrote about the resurrecion prior to the writing of Mark.  So what leads the speakers in this film to reach a conclusion that the resurrection was added by later writers?  The film lacked the kind of evidentiary support I would have liked to have seen.",2,Too subjective and lacking supporting evidence,1271635200,"04 19, 2010",2010,1564,"['film', 'had', 'good', 'points', 'was', 'filled', 'conclusions', 'archeological', 'historical', 'linguistic', 'evidence', 'were', 'presented', 'conclusions', 'appeared', 'be', 'based', 'pure', 'subjectivity', 'found', 'over', 'again', 'asking', 'What', 'conclusion', 'instance', 'one', 'speaker', 'said', 'Most', 'historian', 'think', 'Jesus', 'was', 'born', 'raised', 'Nazareth', 'Not', 'one', 'piece', 'evidence', 'was', 'given', 'lead', 'conclusion', 'Jesus', 'was', 'born', 'Nazareth', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'raised', 'Nazareth', 'Must', 'one', 'conclude', 'Jesus', 'was', 'born', 'Nazareth', 'contrary', 'historical', 'writings', 'simply', 'was', 'raised', 'Nazareth', 'One', 'speaker', 'said', 'early', 'church', 'constructed', 'language', 'John', 'predicted', 'coming', 'Jesus', 'church', 'could', 'explain', 'relationship', 'two', 'speaker', 'historical', 'archeological', 'linguistic', 'evidence', 'support', 'conclusion', 'One', 'speakers', 'inferred', 'resurrection', 'was', 'added', 'Gospel', 'Mark', 'was', 'written', 'earliest', 'version', 'Mark', 'not', 'have', 'resurrection', 'appearances', 'earliest', 'version', 'Mark', 'empty', 'tomb', 'would', 'appear', 'imply', 'resurrection', 'especially', 'light', 'Mark', '8:31', 'where', 'resurrection', 'expressly', 'foretold', 'Additionally', 'Apostle', 'Paul', 'wrote', 'resurrecion', 'prior', 'writing', 'Mark', 'what', 'speakers', 'film', 'reach', 'conclusion', 'resurrection', 'was', 'added', 'later', 'writers', 'film', 'lacked', 'kind', 'evidentiary', 'support', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen']",From Jesus to Christ - The First Christians VHS

It is written and produced by PBS and focuses upon what scholars have learned through exhaustive research about the life and times of early Christianity.This DVD is divided into four parts, each about hour in length.  Each part presents actual photographs of the extant sites mentioned in scriptures, such as Jerusalem, Corinth, the Dead Sea, and Rome.  Each part presents interviews with leading scholars who specialize in the historical period and scriptures, such as professors from Ivy League Universities, and Theological Schools.Part I Presents the culture and times of Jesus, the coming of Jesus, the characteristics of Jesus and  His place in History.  It details the Temple and presents computer generated images of how it would have been in the time of Jesus.Part II  Includes Paul's travels (especially Corinth and Ephessis), beliefs in the Second Coming,  Pentecost, the mission of Disciples, and defining the Church.Part III  Discussed events after the Resurrection of Jesus, the Jewish revolt, the battle of Messada, and the destruction of Jerusalem.  In addition the scholars discuss the writing of the Gospels, presents the essence of each Gospel, compares the Gospels, and examines the separate paths taken by Jews and Christians.Part IV - Presents Paganism and its beliefs within the societies of ancient civilization, it  especially discusses the prominence of ""religion"" in Roman life and the challenge that Christianity gave to its tenets.  We view great images and details of Rome and its buildings and institutions.  It shows the Coptic scrolls and its books.Much of the emphasis of the DVD is upon the everyday people of the time and the historical and archeological data related to that period.  As such it presents no new theological insights but does spark the biblical story to life and stimulate the readers imagination and understanding of the life and times of Jesus and the early Christian church.I highly recommend ""From Jesus to Christ: The First Christians"", especially for those interested in studying the Scriptures.",4,Clear Images of Early Christianity,1273881600,"05 15, 2010",2010,2166,"['Jesus', 'Christ', 'four', 'hour', 'DVD', 'Jesus', 'Disciples', 'Christians', 'early', 'Christianity', 'written', 'produced', 'PBS', 'what', 'scholars', 'have', 'learned', 'exhaustive', 'research', 'life', 'times', 'early', 'Christianity.This', 'DVD', 'divided', 'four', 'parts', 'hour', 'length', 'part', 'actual', 'photographs', 'extant', 'sites', 'mentioned', 'scriptures', 'such', 'Jerusalem', 'Corinth', 'Dead', 'Sea', 'Rome', 'part', 'interviews', 'leading', 'scholars', 'who', 'specialize', 'historical', 'period', 'scriptures', 'such', 'professors', 'Ivy', 'League', 'Universities', 'Theological', 'Schools.Part', 'Presents', 'culture', 'times', 'Jesus', 'coming', 'Jesus', 'characteristics', 'Jesus', 'place', 'History', 'details', 'Temple', 'presents', 'computer', 'generated', 'images', 'how', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'time', 'Jesus.Part', 'II', 'Includes', 'Paul', 'travels', 'especially', 'Corinth', 'Ephessis', 'beliefs', 'Second', 'Coming', 'Pentecost', 'mission', 'Disciples', 'defining', 'Church.Part', 'III', 'Discussed', 'events', 'Resurrection', 'Jesus', 'Jewish', 'revolt', 'battle', 'Messada', 'destruction', 'Jerusalem', 'addition', 'scholars', 'discuss', 'writing', 'Gospels', 'essence', 'Gospel', 'Gospels', 'separate', 'paths', 'taken', 'Jews', 'Christians.Part', 'IV', 'Presents', 'Paganism', 'beliefs', 'societies', 'ancient', 'civilization', 'especially', 'prominence', 'religion', 'Roman', 'life', 'challenge', 'Christianity', 'gave', 'tenets', 'view', 'great', 'images', 'details', 'Rome', 'buildings', 'institutions', 'Coptic', 'scrolls', 'books.Much', 'emphasis', 'DVD', 'everyday', 'people', 'time', 'historical', 'archeological', 'data', 'related', 'period', 'such', 'new', 'theological', 'insights', 'spark', 'biblical', 'story', 'life', 'stimulate', 'readers', 'imagination', 'understanding', 'life', 'times', 'Jesus', 'early', 'Christian', 'church.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'First', 'Christians', 'especially', 'interested', 'studying', 'Scriptures']",From Jesus to Christ - The First Christians VHS
