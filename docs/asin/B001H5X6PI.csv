From seeing the preview I thought this would have been a really great movie especially with all the people that were in it, but the title is far from being accurate.  The movie is ok, but Li's character is a little flaky.  He is an undercover police man who has a very ill wife and a small son.  His boss doesn't care about that and sends him out on assignments.  Li doesn't ask them to check on his wife and son at all.  It takes another police officer from another province to see to them and ends up taking the son with her when his mother dies.  The real highlight of this movie is the actor that plays his son, Tse Mui.  He is really great for a child his age.  Look forward to seeing more of him.",3,The Enforcer,1317600000,"10 3, 2011",2011,746,"['was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'seeing', 'preview', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'great', 'movie', 'especially', 'people', 'were', 'title', 'far', 'being', 'accurate', 'movie', 'ok', 'Li', 'character', 'little', 'flaky', 'undercover', 'police', 'man', 'who', 'very', 'ill', 'wife', 'small', 'son', 'boss', ""n't"", 'care', 'out', 'assignments', 'Li', ""n't"", 'ask', 'check', 'wife', 'son', 'police', 'officer', 'province', 'see', 'up', 'taking', 'son', 'when', 'mother', 'dies', 'real', 'highlight', 'movie', 'actor', 'son', 'Tse', 'Mui', 'really', 'great', 'child', 'age', 'Look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more']",The Enforcer

The movie's story is about a man who works undercover while his wife is sick, and his job gets in the way of being with his family. Before buying this movie I thought that there was going to be the chinese language audio, but sadly to my disappointment,  the movie only has the english audio.

I have bought all the Dragon Dynasty movies and this is the first one I noticed that doesnt have the original language and music. I would have preferred that and it is probably what keeps me from giving the DVD release 5 stars. The movie is a pretty good Jet Li flick. Not better then Fist of Legend but better then most of his newer stuff.

1199204,AC93NK5E3QLMR,B001H5X6PI,Two Timez TSITL,"[0, 2]","That's what it seems like when I buy a Jet Li title. Especially ones I don't hear about or check into until later. Sometimes I just have to grab a kung fu flick and face the music later. I buy most of my kung fu flicks from Amazon as I can find anything here. The only catch is when I'm in the mood to get a new flick right then and there, I have to take chances on movies like these.This is about the 3rd or 4th sorry Jet Li movie I got on the fly. Pretty bad movie. I know its no more than a 2, but I'm still undecided rather to give it a 1. Therefore I'll give it a 1.5. It sucked pretty bad, the english dubs we're sucky, the storyline was sucky, and whenever Jet Li plays with a son, the son is always weird as hell.If you want to waste your money then feel free to buy. I said this before, but great actors have to play in sucky movies too. To tell you the truth, Donnie Yen has made more consistent movies. I still haven't seen IP man, but from what I hear it's his best. I'll have to see if it's as good as Fearless. If it is then I'd have to say Donnie Yen is a more consistent buy. Because if you don't know about a Jet Li movie before you buy, you usually end up getting screwed over.As opposed to if you buy a Donnie Yen flick off the fly, you may get screwed over. But most times it's pretty entertaining, or mediocre at best.
