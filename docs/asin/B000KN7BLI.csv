I loved Eating Out and was hoping for much more (and better) of the same.  No it was quite anticlimactic- this says it is the first gay sequel but they just relied on a bit of slapstick and a weak script. The nude model and new guy Troy (Marco Dapper) is much better looking than the Eating Out original movie Marc (Brett Chukerman) who was supposed to be the hotty - he was notty the hotty.  This is a farce which is not the genre I tend to like - was it supposed to be?  The romantic ribbons of story in the first story are missing in this cobbled together sequel. On a positive note Tiffini (Rebekah Kochan) is becoming better on screen - she was too campy over-acty in the last movie.  In this one she is slimmer (not that she was fat before, she was certainly voluptuous:0  .  She is looking stunning in this one.

1035347,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B000KN7BLI,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[37, 41]","Kyle recently broke up with his boyfriend Mark, and is whining about it to his best friends/fag hags, Tiffani and Gwen, when he gets a pleasant surprise in their college art class:  a jaw-droppingly gorgeous nude male model named Troy.  Troy is also a student at the college, and admits he has had some same-sex experiences, but feels they were wrong and that he needs to find a ""best buddy"" who can help him go straight. Kyle pretends to be a ""reformed"" homosexual himself, in order to get close to Troy, and accompanies him to a meeting of the school's ""ex-gay"" support group. Meanwhile, Mark sees Kyle with Troy and gets jealous, and tries to get close to Troy himself.  In the end, everyone bands together to expose (literally) the hypocritical leader of the ex-gay group.""Eating Out 2: Sloppy Seconds"" (2006) is the supposed sequel to 2004's original ""Eating Out"" film, and has characters and actors (with the exception of Ryan ""Desperate Housewives"" Carnes, who was replaced by Brett Chuckerman in the role of Mark), although it is actually a stand-alone story that doesn't require familiarity with the first film.  The actors (especially former ""America Idol"" contender Jim Verranos as Kyle) seem to be more comfortable in their roles this time around, newcomer Marco Dapper (as Troy) shows significant acting ability, and there are more funny scenes than cringe-inducing ones this time around. The film is also improved by the casting of Mink Stole as Kyle's mom, Adrian Quinonez (from Here!TV's ""Dante;s Cove"") as one of the (not-so)ex-gays, and Michael Serrato (from Logo's ""Big Gay Sketch Show"") as a flamboyant art teacher.  Besides the hypocrisy of many in the ex-gay movement, the story also tries to teach lessons on parental acceptance and trust in a relationship, but it really doesn't register on that level.  DVD includes ""making of"" featurette and director commentary.Don't expect great filmmaking; it's obviously a low-budget farce, and works well on that level.

1035350,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000KN7BLI,Grady Harp,"[9, 11]","'Eating Out 2: Sloppy Seconds' is a sequel that is not really a sequel - unless the common thread of social attitudes and gender dilemmas as an ongoing tale is the source. A low budget, well scripted, tightly directed (Phillip J. Bartell) little film about gay relationships, attraction blunders, and pretending to be something we aren't (mixed representations that Shakespeare used a lot!) result in a light and ultimately charming little movie.Kyle (Jim Verraros) loves Marc (Brett Chukerman) but tires of Marc's obsession with one-night stands and the relationship is 'over'. Pining Kyle is supported by his two loony girl friends Tiffani (Rebekah Kochan) and Gwen (Emily Brooke Hands), each with gender attraction problems of her own. In an art class taught by flamboyant pseudo-straight Neil (Michael Serrato) the three meet the new nude model Troy (superstud Marco Dapper) and together they hatch a plan to repair Kyle's old damage: Troy for all his demeanor is a bisexual who wants to be straight.... maybe and supplies the key to a game of deceit. The manner in which Kyle fakes a relationship with Tiffani in order to convince Troy to join him in a 'change-over program' (read, get close to him...) leads to a series of hilarious 'go straight' classes and confrontation with parents who play both sides of the 'support our sons' game and leads to a perky ending that just happens to make some comments on perceptions of people, with reality winning.The cast is young (with the exception of Mink Stole and Sarah Lilly, both of whom offer solid professional backgrounds to their roles) and attractive and seems to be having a great time pulling off this light farce. There is plenty of spectacular eye candy (Marco Dapper, Brett Chukerman, Nicholas James, Adrian Quinonez, James Michael Bobby, etc) and the women's roles are kept light and genuine. A great movie it is not, but a fun diversion it most assuredly is.

The first film was so sloppy and amateurish it seemed like a warm up to this superior sequel. Eating Out 2: Sloppy Seconds is much wittier than numero uno. The characters got on your nerves the first go-around. Here the ""cartoonish"" nature of the characters softens them, and makes them more agreeable. Also, the comic timing of the actors is much better directed and played.The ex-gay subplot is hysterical, and nicely counter balances the sexual obsession of the main characters for Marco Dapper's hunk. And as hunks go, Mr. Dapper is King of the Hill, or hills, from the backside. See the movie, you'll get it. If I have a main complaint it's that all three Eating Out movies feature the gym bunny porno standards that are unfortunately the norm for gay independent features now. None of the pretty boys has a single hair on their chests. Uh, MOST men DO have hair there.Mr. Dapper, however, transcends any standard of male beauty. He is physically so perfect he'll haunt your retina days after you've seen the film. He looks like a Greek statue come to life. His earnest delivery, soft low voice, and erotic ease in the bisexual shenanigans make him as ideal for this type of sex comedy as Jane Fonda was/is in Barbarella.

1035363,A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI,B000KN7BLI,"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[3, 3]","Touted as ""the first American gay sequel"", ""Sloppy Seconds"" achieves the rare trick of sequels---it surpasses the original. Don't get me wrong; the first was enjoyable, yet it didn't quite meet its potential. Their were flaws in the writing, acting & directing.""Sloppy Seconds"" seems to be a more fully realized production, bringing back the characters Kyle, Gwen & Tiffany in starring status. Blonde hunk Ryan Cairnes is absent this time around, with the role of Marc filled by a brunette hunk and capable actor named Brett Chukerman. The object of desire this time is an unbelievably gorgeous stud named Troy, who is modeling nude for a life drawing class. Marco Dapper is quite the find, beautiful to look at from head to toe. It's discovered that Troy is sexually ambiguous as he confesses his attractions for both sexes. Upon hearing this, the game's afoot as Kyle (the adorable Jim Verraros) & Tiffany strive to bed the stud. Complicating matters is Kyle's estranged boyfriend Marc, who plans his own strategy to bag Troy---by being his gay self. As in the first film, Gwen manipulates Troy into a steamy photo session with Marc, with interesting results.Being a modern screwball comedy like the first film, things spiral out of control as each party screws things up big time with Troy as he discovers their duplicity. Add to this a hilarious subplot about an ""ex-gay"" therapy group on campus (in which poor Kyle masquerades as a ""reformed"" guy dating Tiffany *?!?* as part of the plan to get Troy) and ""Sloppy Seconds"" comes off as a hysterically funny ""Friends"" episode.Helmed by a different director this time (with Allan Q. Brocka staying on as producer), ""Sloppy Seconds"" looks more confident in execution. Deftly directed, with good performances and even sharper dialogue, ""Sloppy Seconds"" is a feast for the ears as well as the eyes (although the yummy guys in this one can't be beat!).And c'mon, guys--a third movie would be great!
