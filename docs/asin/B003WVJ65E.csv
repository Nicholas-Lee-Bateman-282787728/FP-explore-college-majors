I mean they're slow and look fake. There is no plot just fighting from the beginning till the end. The costumes and make-up also look like those in 70's movies.Yuen biao's acting and fighting skills are so disappointing here.In short, this movie is boring and repetitive. It's a huge waste of money and time. It's one of the worst kung fu movies I've ever seen.",1,Outdated filming and fighting technologies.

You must keep an open mind.The plot of the movie is an emperor wanted the best of the Kung-Fu master to train his troops. He presented a series of test to make sure the Kung-Fu master is the best. When he gets to talk to the emperor, he declined to train his troops because it is against his buddhist teaching and beliefs.At the end, the emperor orders to destroy the Shaolin monastery. The remaining Shaolin monks went to release the Kung-Fu master held prisoner at the fortress.The Kung Fu master exhibits great Kung Fu skills.

But the skills this man portrayed was phenominal.  The scenes were kind of creepy at first but later on it began to come together.  The fight scenes were extremely great and the story had come together piece by piece.  This movie is one of the best I've seen in a great while since ""Fist of Legend"".  Biao plays a pure and honest Monk and true believer in his Shaolin origin and the concentration of strength and power that the body can  possess.  This movie is one to be seen over and over again.

1369692,A1DV6NTPQRWZE3,B003WVJ65E,thepete8,"[5, 7]","Another review suggest this movie is actually a TV show or mini-series that has been spliced together for release into a 95 minute movie, and that makes a lot of sense to me after watching this. Kung-Fu Master is no piece of art, as a movie or as a genre entry. Dou Xiao's direction is incredibly poor, and the martial arts are a curious mix of actual skill, badly done (and silly) wire-fu, and cut-aways evincing incredibly bad editing. While a plot can be thin in this genre, it should at least be serviceable. This movie has no discernible plot, and the end makes zero sense.What's good about it? Well, Kung-Fu Master has some excellent long shots of some of the fights that incorporate several combatants at once. Most of these sequences involve fights with javelins or sticks. There's also (I think?) good effort displayed by star Yuen Biao, but the wire-fu and endless cuts always make you question whether it's real or completely faked.It almost seems as though the movie is trying to be a modern day version of one of those cheesy chop-socky movies from the 70s, but I can't quite believe the people behind Kung-Fu Master had that much vision. I got the movie dirt cheap at a close-out sale for a Blockbuster Video store. And that's about all I can recommend you expend for it.
