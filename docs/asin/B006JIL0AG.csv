But perhaps funnier than the movie itself, is how much it can relate to the life of any family with children. Many of the scenes were relatable to me, and I can remember being in similar situations. I really liked the film, but it probably isn't for everyone. I like to laugh, and this movie made me laugh, I enjoyed watching it and I found it very down to earth. It was a nice break from some other more outlandish films that are released each year.I have always been a fan of Catherine Zeta Jones, and she was the perfect actress for the part. It was nice to see her in a fresh movie. Some may say that the plot is not quite 'fresh' but I disagree, , as I said before, this film is all about relate-ability.If you have children, love comedies or romance, or are a Catherine Zeta Jones fan, than you can't afford to miss this one. The idea of one love lost, only to find it in its purist form always draws me in. This film pulls it off effortlessly.

1516257,A37MH7ICH80QOX,B006JIL0AG,Kate McMurry,"[10, 12]","Forty-year-old Sandy (played by a radiant, 41-year-old Catherine Zeta-Jones,Traffic,Chicago,The Mask of Zorro) has been a stay-at-home mother the past ten years. Her husband is a domineering man whom she's never found the courage to confront. Not even when she discovers he's been cheating on her in her own home. Instead, she simply walks out with her eight-year-old daughter (Kelly Gould) and her six-year-old son (Andrew Cherry), moving from the suburbs of metropolitan New York City into the City itself. Her obsessive hobby of compiling and charting sports statistics lands her a job at a sports broadcasting station, and further good luck leads her to an very nice apartment over a coffee shop where she meets 25-year-old Aram Finklestein (played by then 30-year-old Justin Bartha,National Treasure,The Hangover), a barista at the coffee shop.College-educated Aram has had multiple chances for employment as a highly paid office ""suit"" in the City, but he's opted instead to live with his parents and work at a menial job while he searches for something more meaningful to do with his life. After Sandy runs into Aram at a full-contact, self-defense class at a local woman's center, where Aram has hilariously volunteered to be the human punching bag for outraged women who've been ill-used by men, Sandy asks him to babysit her children. This one-time favor leads to his becoming her full-time nanny, and ultimately to the two of them embarking on a May-December romance.Academy Award-winner Zeta-Jones is a brilliant dramatic actress who is equally talented at comedy. As a big fan of romantic comedy in particular, I enjoyed her very much inAmerica's SweetheartsandIntolerable Cruelty(though the movies themselves were not among my favorites), and I was delighted to learn she had made this film. She does a very believable job playing the downtrodden Sandy. If we had entered Sandy's life before the inciting incident of her husband's cheating, we would very likely have found her a very boring person living a passive existence. However, Sandy is anything but passive during the course of this movie. Zeta-Jones convincingly portrays Sandy's extremely interesting journey from a woman made timid by low self-esteem to one who is confident in herself both personally and professionally.Zeta-Jones also has excellent chemistry with her romantic lead, Aram (Bartha). Aram and Sandy are both struggling with similar life issues, including a painful divorce from a betraying spouse, being taken advantage of and pushed around due to a sweet, yielding disposition, and struggling to find themselves as they face a major crossroads in their lives. Aram is the kind of guy every divorced woman with kids dreams about, intelligent, thoughtful, fun to be with, great with kids, an excellent cook, and a sensitive lover.He sounds like a saint, doesn't he? And saints are supposed to be dull characters, or so we are told. But truly he is not. Sandy is equally nice, and the audience is rooting for her to choose kind, decent Aram, whom she deserves and wants, rather than the jerky, age-appropriate men her friends urge her to date instead of Aram in order to avoid a sexist social stigma that men don't have to worry about.I had never seen Bartha's work before viewing this movie, having missed the films he is most known for. I was very impressed with his acting, and I will certainly be on the lookout for him in the future.Unlike several recent romantic comedies I've watched with a huge amount of--to me gratuitous--nudity (No Strings Attached,Friends With Benefits,Love & Other Drugs), there is no nudity in this movie! Yes, there is some swearing, but I'll take that any day over endless rounds of naked bed romping.As any romantic comedy worthy of the name should, this movie has many humorous moments, but importantly, it is quite poignant as well. It is a cliche to say, ""I laughed, I cried,"" when reviewing a movie, but the truth is, I did, and I think that's a very good thing. I believe that this is what any romantic comedy of merit attempts to achieve for its audience.All in all, this film is a keeper in a special place of favor on my romantic-comedy shelf!",5,Very sweet romantic comedy--and no nudity!,1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,4174,"['Forty-year-old', 'Sandy', 'played', 'radiant', '41-year-old', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Traffic', 'Chicago', 'Mask', 'Zorro', 'been', 'stay-at-home', 'mother', 'past', 'ten', 'years', 'husband', 'domineering', 'man', 'whom', 'never', 'found', 'courage', 'confront', 'Not', 'even', 'when', 'been', 'cheating', 'own', 'home', 'Instead', 'simply', 'walks', 'out', 'eight-year-old', 'daughter', 'Kelly', 'Gould', 'six-year-old', 'son', 'Andrew', 'Cherry', 'moving', 'suburbs', 'metropolitan', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'City', 'obsessive', 'hobby', 'compiling', 'charting', 'sports', 'statistics', 'job', 'sports', 'broadcasting', 'station', 'further', 'good', 'luck', 'very', 'nice', 'apartment', 'coffee', 'shop', 'where', '25-year-old', 'Aram', 'Finklestein', 'played', 'then', '30-year-old', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'National', 'Treasure', 'Hangover', 'barista', 'coffee', 'shop.College-educated', 'Aram', 'had', 'multiple', 'chances', 'employment', 'highly', 'paid', 'office', 'suit', 'City', 'opted', 'instead', 'live', 'parents', 'work', 'menial', 'job', 'something', 'more', 'meaningful', 'do', 'life', 'Sandy', 'Aram', 'full-contact', 'self-defense', 'class', 'local', 'woman', 'center', 'where', 'Aram', 'hilariously', 'volunteered', 'be', 'human', 'punching', 'bag', 'outraged', 'women', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'ill-used', 'men', 'Sandy', 'babysit', 'children', 'one-time', 'favor', 'becoming', 'full-time', 'nanny', 'ultimately', 'two', 'embarking', 'May-December', 'romance.Academy', 'Award-winner', 'Zeta-Jones', 'brilliant', 'dramatic', 'actress', 'who', 'equally', 'talented', 'comedy', 'big', 'fan', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'particular', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'inAmerica', 'SweetheartsandIntolerable', 'Cruelty', 'movies', 'were', 'not', 'favorites', 'was', 'delighted', 'learn', 'had', 'made', 'film', 'very', 'believable', 'job', 'playing', 'downtrodden', 'Sandy', 'had', 'entered', 'Sandy', 'life', 'inciting', 'incident', 'husband', 'cheating', 'would', 'very', 'likely', 'have', 'found', 'very', 'boring', 'person', 'living', 'passive', 'existence', 'However', 'Sandy', 'anything', 'passive', 'course', 'movie', 'Zeta-Jones', 'convincingly', 'Sandy', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'journey', 'woman', 'made', 'timid', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'one', 'who', 'confident', 'personally', 'professionally.Zeta-Jones', 'also', 'excellent', 'chemistry', 'romantic', 'lead', 'Aram', 'Bartha', 'Aram', 'Sandy', 'are', 'struggling', 'similar', 'life', 'issues', 'including', 'painful', 'divorce', 'betraying', 'spouse', 'being', 'taken', 'advantage', 'pushed', 'due', 'sweet', 'yielding', 'disposition', 'struggling', 'find', 'face', 'major', 'crossroads', 'lives', 'Aram', 'kind', 'guy', 'divorced', 'woman', 'kids', 'dreams', 'intelligent', 'thoughtful', 'fun', 'be', 'great', 'kids', 'excellent', 'cook', 'sensitive', 'lover.He', 'sounds', 'saint', ""n't"", 'saints', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'dull', 'characters', 'are', 'told', 'truly', 'not', 'Sandy', 'equally', 'nice', 'audience', 'rooting', 'choose', 'kind', 'decent', 'Aram', 'whom', 'rather', 'jerky', 'age-appropriate', 'men', 'friends', 'urge', 'date', 'instead', 'Aram', 'order', 'avoid', 'sexist', 'social', 'stigma', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'about.I', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Bartha', 'work', 'before', 'viewing', 'movie', 'having', 'missed', 'films', 'most', 'known', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'acting', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'lookout', 'future.Unlike', 'several', 'recent', 'romantic', 'comedies', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'huge', 'amount', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'No', 'Strings', 'Attached', 'Friends', 'Benefits', 'Love', 'Other', 'Drugs', 'nudity', 'movie', 'Yes', 'swearing', ""'ll"", 'take', 'day', 'endless', 'rounds', 'naked', 'bed', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'worthy', 'name', 'should', 'movie', 'many', 'humorous', 'moments', 'importantly', 'quite', 'poignant', 'well', 'cliche', 'say', 'laughed', 'cried', 'when', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'truth', 'did', 'think', 'very', 'good', 'thing', 'believe', 'what', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'merit', 'attempts', 'achieve', 'audience.All', 'film', 'keeper', 'special', 'place', 'favor', 'romantic-comedy', 'shelf']",The Rebound

1516267,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B006JIL0AG,Sheryl Fechter,"[9, 10]","I found ""The Rebound"" a delightful Adult Romantic Comedy, written and directed by Bart Freundlich, and not your usual tired fare.  After all, this one stars Catherine Zeta-Jones (Sandy) and Justin Bartha (Aram) as the two leads.  You really can't go wrong with these two presenting a younger man and an older woman theme.  Sandy's two children, Sadie (Kelly Gould) and Frank (Andrew Cherry) are just adorable and precocious as ever.  The R rating is for the themes explored and for some bawdy language, making this a romance, with a generous slice of comedy for grownups.This story basically starts with forty-year old, married Sandy, on her laptop looking through video clips of Sadie.  As she's perusing through her young daughter's accomplishments, she spies in the background her husband being 'unfaithful'.  His behavior does not get explored in detail.  We quickly focus on Sandy and the children moving into an apartment in New York City, above a coffee shop.  This is where the very amiable Aram works and they all first meet.  The children quickly take notice of him and immediately like him.  Shortly after meeting Aram, he offers his babysitting services to free up Sandy for the job hunt.  Sandy gains work for a major sports network as she's an avid sports fan and educated in this area. Her boss (Laura Reilly) is strongly acted by Lynn Whitfield who becomes a role model of Sandy.  The 'babysitter', whom the children adore and so does Sandy, is permanently employed as the kid's ""nanny"".  The two find a comfortable friendship with each other by this time and Sandy is getting more stable and happy with her life.Aram has a degree in Sociology, although is content working in the coffee shop as he has been hit hard by a relationship also.  He married a French woman who used him cruelly to gain citizenship, then left him.  He won't divorce her or she would not be able to stay in America.  He lives with his parents, the Finkelstein's (Art Garfunkel acts the part of the father in a uniquely comedic role).  Aram possesses a generous, warm and thoughtful nature that one couldn't help but love.  One of Sandy's friends begins urging (more like hounding) her to go on a blind date with a Chiropractor (John Schneider) as Sandy really doesn't want any part of it.  She finally relents and leaves the kids with Aram to go out with him.  As far as blind dates go, this one takes the cake as Schneider is a complete fool and Sandy's responses to him are equally funny.  When she returns to the apartment after the date from hell, Aram is there for her afterwards, she downs a generous portion of vodka.  The two begin talking and as one thing can lead to another the friendship shifts into an intimate realm.As usual with this type of movie, there is a plot twist.  This one was quite an unexpected one for me.  I won't go forward describing this very reflective and working film as it really could be a spoiler for anyone interested in seeing this.  You will be seeing some beautiful scenery and further explore the soundtrack (Jim Black) that starts with a bang from the beginning.  While Sandy is yelling out the song ""B****"" (Meredith Brooks) in her car while driving, Aram sings ""Every Time You Go Away"" (Paul Young) to Sadie so she'll fall asleep. It is always enjoyable to see Catherine Zeta-Jones in this type of role; strong and vulnerable at the same time.  She is one actress that can do this with ease while adding her sharp dry wit.  Justin Bartha has the innocence and sweet qualities to flesh out the role of Aram, bringing him to life.  The two share an easy rapport and a believable chemistry for a lighter and funny view with a 'heartbeat'.",5,Not Your Typical May~December Romance,1327708800,"01 28, 2012",2012,3671,"['found', 'Rebound', 'delightful', 'Adult', 'Romantic', 'Comedy', 'written', 'directed', 'Bart', 'Freundlich', 'not', 'usual', 'tired', 'fare', 'one', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Sandy', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'Aram', 'two', 'leads', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'two', 'presenting', 'younger', 'man', 'older', 'woman', 'theme', 'Sandy', 'two', 'children', 'Sadie', 'Kelly', 'Gould', 'Frank', 'Andrew', 'Cherry', 'are', 'just', 'adorable', 'precocious', 'ever', 'R', 'rating', 'themes', 'explored', 'bawdy', 'language', 'making', 'romance', 'generous', 'slice', 'comedy', 'grownups.This', 'story', 'basically', 'forty-year', 'old', 'married', 'Sandy', 'laptop', 'looking', 'video', 'clips', 'Sadie', 'perusing', 'young', 'daughter', 'accomplishments', 'background', 'husband', 'being', ""'unfaithful"", 'behavior', 'not', 'get', 'explored', 'detail', 'quickly', 'focus', 'Sandy', 'children', 'moving', 'apartment', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'coffee', 'shop', 'where', 'very', 'amiable', 'Aram', 'works', 'first', 'meet', 'children', 'quickly', 'take', 'notice', 'immediately', 'Shortly', 'meeting', 'Aram', 'babysitting', 'services', 'free', 'up', 'Sandy', 'job', 'hunt', 'Sandy', 'gains', 'work', 'major', 'sports', 'network', 'avid', 'sports', 'fan', 'educated', 'area', 'boss', 'Laura', 'Reilly', 'strongly', 'acted', 'Lynn', 'Whitfield', 'who', 'role', 'model', 'Sandy', ""'babysitter"", 'whom', 'children', 'adore', 'so', 'Sandy', 'permanently', 'employed', 'kid', 'nanny', 'two', 'find', 'comfortable', 'friendship', 'other', 'time', 'Sandy', 'getting', 'more', 'stable', 'happy', 'life.Aram', 'degree', 'Sociology', 'content', 'working', 'coffee', 'shop', 'been', 'hit', 'hard', 'relationship', 'also', 'married', 'French', 'woman', 'who', 'used', 'cruelly', 'gain', 'citizenship', 'then', 'left', 'wo', ""n't"", 'divorce', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'stay', 'America', 'parents', 'Finkelstein', 'Art', 'Garfunkel', 'part', 'father', 'uniquely', 'comedic', 'role', 'Aram', 'generous', 'warm', 'thoughtful', 'nature', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'One', 'Sandy', 'friends', 'urging', 'more', 'hounding', 'go', 'blind', 'date', 'Chiropractor', 'John', 'Schneider', 'Sandy', 'really', ""n't"", 'want', 'part', 'finally', 'relents', 'kids', 'Aram', 'go', 'out', 'As', 'far', 'blind', 'dates', 'go', 'one', 'cake', 'Schneider', 'complete', 'fool', 'Sandy', 'responses', 'are', 'equally', 'funny', 'When', 'apartment', 'date', 'hell', 'Aram', 'there', 'afterwards', 'generous', 'portion', 'vodka', 'two', 'begin', 'talking', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'lead', 'friendship', 'shifts', 'intimate', 'realm.As', 'usual', 'type', 'movie', 'plot', 'twist', 'one', 'was', 'quite', 'unexpected', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'forward', 'describing', 'very', 'reflective', 'working', 'film', 'really', 'could', 'be', 'spoiler', 'anyone', 'interested', 'seeing', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'further', 'explore', 'soundtrack', 'Jim', 'Black', 'bang', 'beginning', 'Sandy', 'yelling', 'out', 'song', 'B****', 'Meredith', 'Brooks', 'car', 'driving', 'Aram', 'Every', 'Time', 'Go', 'Away', 'Paul', 'Young', 'Sadie', ""'ll"", 'fall', 'asleep', 'always', 'enjoyable', 'see', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'type', 'role', 'strong', 'vulnerable', 'same', 'time', 'one', 'actress', 'can', 'do', 'ease', 'adding', 'sharp', 'dry', 'wit', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'innocence', 'sweet', 'qualities', 'flesh', 'out', 'role', 'Aram', 'bringing', 'life', 'two', 'share', 'easy', 'rapport', 'believable', 'chemistry', 'lighter', 'funny', 'view', ""'heartbeat""]",The Rebound
1516268,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B006JIL0AG,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","In the first few minutes of the film it develops the character of Catherine Zeta-Jones, a person who takes pride in her mother-hood and woman-hood. And she loves sports. Every guys dream...except for her husband. She moves to clean version of NYC (did they sweep the sidewalks before shooting?) and quickly finds an apartment and a job, perhaps the most unbelievable part of the film. Justin Bartha's character is developed right after the credits by a quick conversation with his parents(Art Garfunkel and Joanna Gleason). The break-up has Catherine off balance. She has developed some real emotional issues, apparently due to some male dependency feelings. Both of them are on ""the rebound"" as Justin becomes the nanny. Catherine is 15 years older than Justin.Alice Playten as Sensei Dana was great. I couldn't stop laughing at her scene as a Woman's Center instructor. Catherine's first date was another LOL moment at simple toilet humor taken to a different level. At this point, the film was 5 stars on the strength of those scenes. Later, it appears the writers painted themselves into a corner and didn't know how to end the film, which seemed a bit forced. I may have enjoyed the film more with Demi and Ashton, but that would be too much to ask. Catherine is convincing in her role, the rest of the characters less so, as the film clearly centers around her.F-bombs, sex, sexual talk,",5,CATHERINE ZETA-JONES ...WITH MOLTEN FURY,1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,1393,"['first', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'character', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'person', 'who', 'pride', 'mother-hood', 'woman-hood', 'sports', 'guys', 'dream', 'husband', 'clean', 'version', 'NYC', 'did', 'sweep', 'sidewalks', 'shooting', 'quickly', 'apartment', 'job', 'perhaps', 'most', 'unbelievable', 'part', 'film', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'character', 'developed', 'right', 'credits', 'quick', 'conversation', 'parents', 'Art', 'Garfunkel', 'Joanna', 'Gleason', 'break-up', 'Catherine', 'off', 'balance', 'developed', 'real', 'emotional', 'issues', 'apparently', 'due', 'male', 'dependency', 'feelings', 'are', 'rebound', 'Justin', 'nanny', 'Catherine', '15', 'years', 'older', 'Justin.Alice', 'Playten', 'Sensei', 'Dana', 'was', 'great', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'laughing', 'scene', 'Woman', 'Center', 'instructor', 'Catherine', 'first', 'date', 'was', 'LOL', 'moment', 'simple', 'toilet', 'humor', 'taken', 'different', 'level', 'point', 'film', 'was', '5', 'stars', 'strength', 'scenes', 'Later', 'writers', 'painted', 'corner', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'end', 'film', 'seemed', 'bit', 'forced', 'may', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'more', 'Demi', 'Ashton', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'ask', 'Catherine', 'convincing', 'role', 'rest', 'characters', 'less', 'so', 'film', 'clearly', 'centers', 'her.F-bombs', 'sex', 'sexual', 'talk']",The Rebound
