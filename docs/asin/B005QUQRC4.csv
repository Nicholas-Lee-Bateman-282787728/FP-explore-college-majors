After some joking around the lewd fun begins which leads to the deaths of said 4 teens, at least I assume they die since we don't see much besides a blood splatter and hear just a few screams. Sometime later a realtor is showing the house off to a family of 5, the young son has a camera he's using to film the experience for a documentary he's doing (however he seems a little young to be making a documentary).Since the parents are strapped for cash the husband says they'll take the house, which the wife doesn't agree with, oh and suddenly the realtor ends up dead in the driveway of the house, you'll have to wonder how that happened since the director chose not to film it. Soon after moving into the house the son catches some odd and scary happenings, one of them being a mover falling down the stairs and breaking his neck. The mom wants to move out but the dad says they need to give the house a chance since they're again low on money.The son continues to see strange things happen on his camera, the dad seems to be going a little more insane even after putting a security camera system in the house to catch if someone is breaking into the house at night.

Unfortunately, this movie lacks all the frights or production value of the Paranormal Activity series, leaving you feeling flat and a little angry that you spent the time to watch this.The movie starts with a massacre of random characters that are not really mentioned again. Where was the blood or bodies later? Why don't the cops know of this? It just happens and is done. Then, a tormented family of five moves in. Instantly the bodies start piling up. In 6 days, four people are killed on the property. The cops do not suspect the gun toting, post traumatic stress father. Instead they just throw their hands up. Really? Four bodies in six days, and no one suspects the man who found them and has a gun on his hip? Wow. There are more plot holes in this movie than I can even acknowledge. This is just one.Some of that can be forgiven if the characters are compelling or the actors charming. Neither one is the case here. Every member of the family is unlikable, boring, and underdeveloped. Jason Williams delivers a performance that offers the only horror of this movie - the horror of a terrible performance.I love the Amityville franchise.

Clearly when you watch it, our view of the house is kept vague enough to know they are just in any house as external shots are kept to a minimum.It opens citing the De Feo incident and then how the Lutzes moved in after. Thats about the only relationship this movie has to the previous Amityville franchise. Everything else is shot in ""Paranormal Activity"" style, ala camera point of view where the young boy seems to want to be the next ""Spielberg"" (actual quote). Meanwhile weird things are happening in the house that the boy either gets on video or not. The parents are ignorant, and his hot older sister is too interested in her own wants, while the younger sister seems to make imaginary friends.The acting is either over or under from the entire family. Clearly it is all scripted and, like all single point of view films, people are completely comfortable in letting out all their baggage and hostilities in front of the camera. And like all the others, people with cameras can multi-task.I might point out that the video on the phone turns from an iPod to an iPhone. Just an observation.The many ""black outs"" seem to be ""creative"" budget excuses. But they dont add to the drama or scariness of the film. In fact, the dad, who is the eternal realist, dulls the movie irreparably.It's a fun movie on it's own, which merits it one or two stars, but ultimately this is not part of the real Amityville franchise. The whole premise of ghostly stuff rests entirely on the Amityville house which, for the audience sake, does not need any real justification as its an already installed storyline. So now its just ""happenings"" that we can just assume its the house doing it.
