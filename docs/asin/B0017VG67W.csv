Tracee Ellis Ross is one hell of an actress, she's a hoot as Jill Clayton. Every episode is funny, heartwarming, and surprisely real.

And after Jill Marie Jones withdrew from the show, the ratings declined, plus of un-proper promotions. I did hear talks about the final ladies (Tracee, Golden and Perisa) filing a lawsuit because of the 22 episode order that was originally stated in contract hasn't been completed. Only 13 were broadcast.On a positive note, I don't know if anyone has seen the box art cover to season 4 of Girlfriends on TVShowsOnDVD.com but it's hella hot, hella, sexy. It's still unclear if there will be any special features, at least CBS/Paramount cared enough to still produce Girlfriends on DVD.The 24 listed episodes are: (IN STORES JULY 29!)70.

I think each and every season gets better and better.The first episode in season 4 is one of my absolute favourites in the entire series.  It's called Some Enchanted Evening and Joan is trying to get out of the rain and shares a doorway with a stranger.  Later she finds out that he is her boyfriends agent, Brock.  One thing leads to another and they kiss and end up at Brocks place.  He won't sleep with her while she is still dating Ellis so she agrees to break up with Ellis.  However, she has always wanted Ellis to declare his love for her and what do you know; he does.  Toni and Todd are having trouble in their new marriage and she finds out that he is deep in debt and leaves him.I cannot say enough good things about Girlfriends.  It's always funny yet it has it's 'dramatic' moments too.  It's very relatable to many women out there trying to find themselves and trying to meet Mr Right or to make their own relationships work.  I love the friendships these girls have with each other and they always have each others back.  I truly feel that it's very very underated and that's sad.  This is such a great comedy that should appeal to so many people and should never have been cancelled.  I cannot wait for this to arrive and I know I'm going to enjoy each and every minute watching this (and re-watching it too).",5,I soooooo love this show :-0,1214870400,"07 1, 2008",2008,1414,"['can', 'not', 'wait', 'release', 'might', 'hang', 'expense', 'get', 'fast', 'shipping', 'think', 'season', 'better', 'better.The', 'first', 'episode', 'season', '4', 'one', 'absolute', 'favourites', 'entire', 'series', 'called', 'Enchanted', 'Evening', 'Joan', 'trying', 'get', 'rain', 'shares', 'doorway', 'stranger', 'Later', 'out', 'boyfriends', 'agent', 'Brock', 'One', 'thing', 'kiss', 'end', 'up', 'Brocks', 'place', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'still', 'dating', 'Ellis', 'break', 'up', 'Ellis', 'However', 'always', 'wanted', 'Ellis', 'declare', 'love', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'Toni', 'Todd', 'are', 'having', 'trouble', 'new', 'marriage', 'out', 'deep', 'debt', 'him.I', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'Girlfriends', 'always', 'funny', 'yet', ""'dramatic"", 'moments', 'too', 'very', 'relatable', 'many', 'women', 'out', 'there', 'trying', 'find', 'trying', 'meet', 'Mr', 'Right', 'make', 'own', 'relationships', 'work', 'love', 'friendships', 'girls', 'have', 'other', 'always', 'have', 'others', 'back', 'truly', 'feel', 'very', 'very', 'underated', 'sad', 'such', 'great', 'comedy', 'should', 'appeal', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'cancelled', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'arrive', 'know', ""'m"", 'going', 'enjoy', 'minute', 'watching', 're-watching', 'too']",Girlfriends: Season 4

1158039,A3CMDR34KFLGFX,B0017VG67W,Reader2008,"[1, 2]","This season had its highs and lows, but the thing that stands out the most to me is the terrible writing for Toni.  Toni is HORRIBLE and even more of a shallow beyotch than she normally is.  I literally roll my eyes everytime she starts to talk.  I still like Toni the best though.Joan is so annoying and too tense.  I don't see why any fun person would want to be around her tense anal butt.Another issue I had is that Toni and Todd have NO chemistry whatsover.  When Todd is around Toni he looks beat down and weak.  These two should have never been paired.Finally, I like that the weaves have gotten better.  Toni's weave is banging and so is Maya's.  One crazy episode was Maya not wanting to date a SECURITY GUARD.  Her ex husband is a baggage handler; she really has no room to be bougee.Update: I spoke too soon.  Toni wore a wig after the banging weave and then had some sort of hairstyle that doesn't match her personality.Highs of this season:1. The realism of Joan not being fulfilled in her job and quitting2. Toni deciding to get therapy and her mother making her choose Todd finally.Lows:1. Toni's personality is horrible.2. William's corny personality is horrible.3. Joan would drive a priest crazy with her over the top personality.HIGHLIGHTS:1. Thelma from Goodtimes was the object of Williams desire.  I hadn't seen her in 20 years and was happy to see her.2. Lamont from Sanford and Son is Lynne's father.

Although, I am a huge fan who still supported the show, I must admit that the episodes were not as interesting or as entertaining without Jill Marie Jones in the midst of things. In my opinion, I don't feel that this show could have survived even if Jill had stayed, and one of the other main characters had left. For me, Girlfriends was at its best when all of the original character's were front and center. I love Jill, Golden, Tracee, Persia and Reggie because all of them are so talented and their characters worked so well together, and made the show a hit. It is just a fact, having the right ""chemistry"" means everything and when the ""chemistry"" is altered then things just don't gel together as well. With such a talented cast of individuals, for me it is a major disappointment that the SOMEONE'S at the CW network did not make an intelligent decision to take care of this  wonderful cast and allow the show to ""go out in style, and on top.""
