Showtime needs to expand its horizons, and let amazon.com stream seasons of Dexter the way they do Breaking Bad and other great shows.  I'm sure the broadcasting networks come out just fine in terms of profit.  I will never go back to the zillion worthless channels, commercial-ridden concept of satelite and cable.  Streaming is the only way for me.Back to Season 5.  This season had to build in a different way because of Kim's murder in Season 4, which I consider to be near-masterpiece material, with John Lithgow proving he was the embodiment of evil.  This season worked well as a bridge, with Julia Styles creating a lead-female diversion, but didn't have quite the edge of Season's 3 & 4.The plot really carried the season, as opposed to Emmy-worthy acting.  Roles became quirky, but not intense.  Still, next to Breaking Bad it is the best drama on TV.  That is high praise from me.  Dexter also retains its sense of humor, where Breaking Bad became so intense in the last season that smiles were few and far between, Dexter always has Yamana, not to mention Dexter's always chuckle-worthy internal dialogues with himself and Harry.",5,Alway an Adrenaline Rush!,1320537600,"11 6, 2011",2011,1250,"[""'m"", 'pretty', 'much', 'livid', 'way', 'watch', 'Season', '6', 'finished', 'first', 'broadcast', 'run', 'Showtime', 'expand', 'horizons', 'let', 'amazon.com', 'stream', 'seasons', 'Dexter', 'way', 'do', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'other', 'great', 'shows', ""'m"", 'sure', 'broadcasting', 'networks', 'come', 'out', 'just', 'fine', 'terms', 'profit', 'will', 'never', 'go', 'back', 'zillion', 'worthless', 'channels', 'commercial-ridden', 'concept', 'satelite', 'cable', 'Streaming', 'only', 'way', 'me.Back', 'Season', '5', 'season', 'had', 'build', 'different', 'way', 'Kim', 'murder', 'Season', '4', 'consider', 'be', 'near-masterpiece', 'material', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'proving', 'was', 'embodiment', 'evil', 'season', 'worked', 'well', 'bridge', 'Julia', 'Styles', 'creating', 'lead-female', 'diversion', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'quite', 'edge', 'Season', '3', '4.The', 'plot', 'really', 'carried', 'season', 'opposed', 'Emmy-worthy', 'acting', 'Roles', 'became', 'quirky', 'not', 'intense', 'Still', 'next', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'best', 'drama', 'TV', 'high', 'praise', 'Dexter', 'also', 'sense', 'humor', 'where', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'became', 'so', 'intense', 'last', 'season', 'smiles', 'were', 'few', 'far', 'Dexter', 'always', 'Yamana', 'not', 'mention', 'Dexter', 'always', 'chuckle-worthy', 'internal', 'dialogues', 'Harry']",N/A

1352653,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B003L77GRO,barry,"[3, 3]","Since DEXTER'S very first season it has been my very favorite tv series.  Season 4 was considered by many to be a milestone for the series.  John Lithgow certainly left his imprint forever as The Trinity Killer.  But though his acting was superb and the cat and mouse portrayed between him and Dexter was mezmerizing, the season is more important as the one that had one of the most shocking and series changing season endings in history.  The death discovered in the last few minutes of the season finale rocked and shocked all DEXTER viewers.  All knew that the series would never be the same with this character loss and how would it move forward.Season 5 handles all of that not only with great success but also by providing what may be the shows best season yet.  At the time of its airing fans viewed with expectation and some were not favorable to the plot line or the addition of Julia Stiles for the season.  Fact is those who truly loved the series were comparing the season to all those before and especially the beloved lost character.  So before watching season 5 I viewed season 4 for true continuity.  Watching Dexter who struggles with human emotion was amazing.  And simply put, the plotline for this season worked perfectly as the horrific center as well as a way to move Dexter along in his development.  Upon my second viewing of this season everything was raised a bar.  Julia Stiles is superb here as Lumen, a rape, torture and potential murder victim who Dexter discovers.  Her emotional development as a caged victim set free who then works with Dexter is perhaps the best work of Ms. Stiles career and she and Michael C. Hall have a chemistry that fits this story line perfectly.  The addition of Jonny Lee Miller as self help guru Jordan Chase provides the seasons villanous character and he masters the role perfectly and is in every way as good as John Lithgow was.DEXTER is one of those shows that always looks best on blu ray.  The video is always crisp and clear with superb clarity.  Black/white ratio is excellent and colors pop.  The scenery of Miami shines and facial close ups show great detail and flesh tones are perfect.  Day and night scenes are both levels above the dvd.  I own all the seasons on blu ray but found the audio the best here.  The Dolby TruHD 5.1 track utilizes all the speakers perfectly and this season had many shock scenes and scary moments that utilized rear speakers to great effect.  You'll be jumping out of your skin.  If you love DEXTER this season is a must have and the blu ray would be the greatest gift to yourself.  Season 4 and the Trinity Killer was indeed supreme but season 5 moves DEXTER forward with thrills and chills galore.  A great season of a superb series.",5,Amazing season - review of the blu ray,1314489600,"08 28, 2011",2011,2739,"['DEXTER', 'very', 'first', 'season', 'been', 'very', 'favorite', 'tv', 'series', 'Season', '4', 'was', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'milestone', 'series', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'certainly', 'left', 'imprint', 'forever', 'Trinity', 'Killer', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'cat', 'mouse', 'portrayed', 'Dexter', 'was', 'mezmerizing', 'season', 'more', 'important', 'one', 'had', 'one', 'most', 'shocking', 'series', 'changing', 'season', 'endings', 'history', 'death', 'discovered', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'season', 'finale', 'rocked', 'shocked', 'DEXTER', 'viewers', 'knew', 'series', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'character', 'loss', 'how', 'would', 'move', 'forward.Season', '5', 'handles', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'success', 'also', 'providing', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'shows', 'best', 'season', 'yet', 'time', 'airing', 'fans', 'viewed', 'expectation', 'were', 'not', 'favorable', 'plot', 'line', 'addition', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'season', 'Fact', 'who', 'truly', 'loved', 'series', 'were', 'comparing', 'season', 'especially', 'beloved', 'lost', 'character', 'watching', 'season', '5', 'viewed', 'season', '4', 'true', 'continuity', 'Watching', 'Dexter', 'who', 'human', 'emotion', 'was', 'amazing', 'simply', 'put', 'plotline', 'season', 'worked', 'perfectly', 'horrific', 'center', 'as', 'well', 'way', 'move', 'Dexter', 'development', 'second', 'viewing', 'season', 'everything', 'was', 'raised', 'bar', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'superb', 'here', 'Lumen', 'rape', 'torture', 'potential', 'murder', 'victim', 'who', 'Dexter', 'discovers', 'emotional', 'development', 'caged', 'victim', 'set', 'free', 'who', 'then', 'Dexter', 'perhaps', 'best', 'work', 'Ms.', 'Stiles', 'career', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'have', 'chemistry', 'story', 'line', 'perfectly', 'addition', 'Jonny', 'Lee', 'Miller', 'self', 'help', 'guru', 'Jordan', 'Chase', 'seasons', 'villanous', 'character', 'role', 'perfectly', 'way', 'as', 'good', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'was.DEXTER', 'one', 'shows', 'always', 'best', 'blu', 'ray', 'video', 'always', 'crisp', 'clear', 'superb', 'clarity', 'Black/white', 'ratio', 'excellent', 'colors', 'pop', 'scenery', 'Miami', 'shines', 'facial', 'close', 'ups', 'show', 'great', 'detail', 'flesh', 'tones', 'are', 'perfect', 'Day', 'night', 'scenes', 'are', 'levels', 'dvd', 'own', 'seasons', 'blu', 'ray', 'found', 'audio', 'best', 'here', 'Dolby', 'TruHD', '5.1', 'track', 'speakers', 'perfectly', 'season', 'had', 'many', 'shock', 'scenes', 'scary', 'moments', 'utilized', 'rear', 'speakers', 'great', 'effect', ""'ll"", 'be', 'jumping', 'skin', 'love', 'DEXTER', 'season', 'must', 'have', 'blu', 'ray', 'would', 'be', 'greatest', 'gift', 'Season', '4', 'Trinity', 'Killer', 'was', 'indeed', 'supreme', 'season', '5', 'moves', 'DEXTER', 'forward', 'thrills', 'chills', 'galore', 'great', 'season', 'superb', 'series']",N/A

1352659,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B003L77GRO,B. Martin,"[1, 1]","The latest season of Showtime's hit series is as engrossing and entertaining as ever, but that doesn't mean that it's perfect.  On the contrary, season five might just be the weakest of the bunch thanks to several undervwhelming plot strands, some missteps with the writing and the clear lack of an endgame on the part of the writers.  Without spoiling any plot points, let's just say that certain events are put in motion during this season that make it hard to see any sort of good outcome for our protagonist.And yet season five is still a must watch thanks to the lead performance of Michael C. Hall as well as the work turned in by his supporting players.  The new season also benefits from a guest starring role by Julia Stiles as a rape victim who teams up with Dexter to hunt down her assailant and his accomplices.  It is this Bonnie and Clyde-esque story arc that is the heart of these twelve episodes and as long as the show follows this trajectory, it is as as riveting ever.  Unfortunately too much time is spent on plot lines that don't go anywhere or are not fully integrated into the narrative.  You can almost feel the series spinning its wheels as a murderous drug cartel is investigated or when Angel and LaGuerta let work interfere with their marriage (who saw that coming?).  Sometimes the plot lines are intriguing but left largely untapped.  The most glaring example of this is the manner in which the kids are sent away to stay with their grandparents following Rita's death.  What a rich area this would have been to explore in terms of watching Dexter deal with single parenthood, grieving children and his dark passenger.  Alas, the kids are out of the picture which makes it much easier for him to tend to business.It may sound like I'm being hard on season 5, but it is really another strong installment for the popular and acclaimed series.  Peter Weller and Johnny Lee Miller help elevate things to another level with their memorable guest performances.  When all is said and done, Dexter makes it through yet another blood soaked season.  But I can't help but be reminded of the words of Jordan Chase (Miller):  ""Tick, tick, tick....that's the sound of your life running out"".  The clock is quickly expiring on Dexter and his dark passenger.

But, yes, it is film actress Julia Stiles who joined the Dexter cast this season and she does a bang up job as the second lead in the show. She sets in motion the fact that there are four guys out there who are systematically murdering women after sexually abusing and torturing them for weeks.  Lumen wants revenge on these men but she threatens to bring Dexter's whole house of cards apart because she doesn't know how to kill people like he does.The villain in chief they need to bring to an end is played by Jonny Lee Miller as one of these rich, lifestyle gurus with seminars, tapes, books, shows and so forth.  If you pick his message apart, as Dexter does, it clearly does allow for taking life to the extreme edges and going over them.  Dexter has his comic moments as well where bodies are tumbling out of trucks encased in cans or he's murdering someone in an RV while the police stand right outside trying to peer in.  As usual, criminally oriented Florida, and especially Miami is the perfect backdrop to all of this.There are many subplots going as well and Deb, his sister, is the detective handling the case plus her partner suspects Dexter of murdering Rita.  Her partner brings twisted Narc Peter Weller (ROBOCOP) onto the case and every time he shambles into the picture, Dexter is in yet a new kind of trouble.I will again warn anyone new that the Dexter show no longer follows the novels except in the broadest possible strokes.  There are a substantial amount of characters who are alive in the novels who were killed off in the show.  I do read the novels when they come out and watch the show when it comes out.  However, I now think of them as ""related"" works only.  The BONES show does the same thing, bearing only some semblance to Kathy Reichs's novels.  If you don't like your shows and books to be this wide apart and already are watching the show, you may want to wait to read the books all in one big gulp as a different experience.",5,Julia Stiles Is Inspirational Addition to Cast,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,2090,"['will', 'barely', 'recognize', 'first', 'abused', 'victim', 'whom', 'Dexter', 'rescues', 'cadre', 'serial', 'killers', 'yes', 'film', 'actress', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'who', 'joined', 'Dexter', 'cast', 'season', 'bang', 'up', 'job', 'second', 'lead', 'show', 'motion', 'fact', 'are', 'four', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'systematically', 'murdering', 'women', 'sexually', 'abusing', 'torturing', 'weeks', 'Lumen', 'revenge', 'men', 'bring', 'Dexter', 'whole', 'house', 'cards', 'apart', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'kill', 'people', 'villain', 'chief', 'need', 'bring', 'end', 'played', 'Jonny', 'Lee', 'Miller', 'one', 'rich', 'lifestyle', 'gurus', 'seminars', 'tapes', 'books', 'shows', 'so', 'forth', 'pick', 'message', 'apart', 'Dexter', 'clearly', 'allow', 'taking', 'life', 'extreme', 'edges', 'going', 'Dexter', 'comic', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'where', 'bodies', 'are', 'tumbling', 'trucks', 'encased', 'cans', 'murdering', 'someone', 'RV', 'police', 'stand', 'right', 'trying', 'peer', 'usual', 'criminally', 'oriented', 'Florida', 'especially', 'Miami', 'perfect', 'backdrop', 'are', 'many', 'subplots', 'going', 'as', 'well', 'Deb', 'sister', 'detective', 'handling', 'case', 'partner', 'Dexter', 'murdering', 'Rita', 'partner', 'brings', 'twisted', 'Narc', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'ROBOCOP', 'case', 'time', 'picture', 'Dexter', 'yet', 'new', 'kind', 'trouble.I', 'will', 'again', 'warn', 'anyone', 'new', 'Dexter', 'show', 'no', 'longer', 'novels', 'broadest', 'possible', 'strokes', 'are', 'substantial', 'amount', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'alive', 'novels', 'who', 'were', 'killed', 'off', 'show', 'do', 'read', 'novels', 'when', 'come', 'out', 'watch', 'show', 'when', 'out', 'However', 'now', 'think', 'related', 'only', 'BONES', 'show', 'same', 'thing', 'bearing', 'only', 'semblance', 'Kathy', 'Reichs', 'novels', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'shows', 'books', 'be', 'wide', 'apart', 'already', 'are', 'watching', 'show', 'may', 'want', 'wait', 'read', 'books', 'one', 'big', 'gulp', 'different', 'experience']",N/A

Having watched all 5 seasons now, I feel the show just gets better as it goes along (though I wasn't as fond of Season 2 as Season 1 and the others. ) After Season 4's triumphant and super-creepy performance by John Lithgow, not to mention the absolutely shocking and devastating finale, I too wondered how they could top themselves. Well, they did, with the most horrifying portrait(s) of pure, unalloyed, sadistic evil yet showcased on the  series -- at least Jimmy Smits and Lithgow had their reasons, no matter how twisted. We have some suspense involving the nanny, Quinn, Peter Weller's character, and the club shooting + the annoying new female detective (?), but by far the emotional burden of the series is carried by Julia Styles as Lumen, who does an outstanding job in an extremely difficult story arc. She's completely believable as a horrifically abused victim on the brink of death who goes through all kinds of emotions as she struggles to reclaim her shattered life and become a survivor -- I love the scene when she makes scrambled eggs for Astor and Olivia -- ""Good hangover food"" -- and then advises Dex not to rat on them, that they've suffered enough for their little drinking spree. Speaking of Olivia, I really loved the scene when Dex takes on her mom's abusive boyfriend, explaining in clinical detail just why everything he's doing to him hurts so much and why Olivia was so terrified of the same abuse he doled out to her. Scenes like these, plus Dex's growing relationship with Lumen, show him developing into more of a human being with feelings, as other reviewers have noted -- even the killing in the shed, though not by any means altruistic nor in line with Harry's Code, shows a human response by someone under incredible grief and stress who has just been pushed over the edge. I look forward to Season 6 eagerly -- if they top Seasons 5 & 6, I will be truly impressed. I knew Michael C. Hall had cancer and have been hoping he would recover, but am sad to learn of his divorce from Jennifer Carpenter.

Just as I have done the last 4 seasons of Dexter I waited at my local Wally World until midnight to pick up my copy then rushed home for what usually turns out to watching the whole season in about two and a half days.I had read some of the criticism about how the shows formula was getting stale and that the show needed Dexter to take bigger risk or to get caught up in more dangerous situations. Well, for two episodes I started to feel the same way. I started to wonder if this show had fallen into a trap of predictability that the Showtime network thought was safe and wouldn't anger fans. (spoilers) But then...Lumen comes into the story the only way such a dynamic character could entire Dexter's life. For the first time in season five I witnessed an actor display emotions that I did not doubt for a second. Lumen brought a breath of life into the season that I was not expecting. From there the story only gets better and better. I mean come on...it's got Robo Cop (well not quite) in it and he plays a great bully. I thought the casting for this season was tremendous.I don't want to give away anymore than I already have. I have to say that in many ways this season went a lot further than my expectations. The only downside is now that I have finished watching season five I have a very long wait until season six is released.This season was full of twist and more than a handful of moments that will leave your jaw on the floor.",5,Amazing!,1313539200,"08 17, 2011",2011,1593,"[""'m"", 'type', 'fan', 'can', 'own', 'entire', 'season', 'Blu', 'ray', 'so', 'can', 'enjoy', 'episodes', 'start', 'finish', 'minimum', 'breaks', 'Just', 'have', 'done', 'last', '4', 'seasons', 'Dexter', 'waited', 'local', 'Wally', 'World', 'midnight', 'pick', 'up', 'copy', 'then', 'rushed', 'home', 'what', 'usually', 'out', 'watching', 'whole', 'season', 'about', 'two', 'half', 'days.I', 'had', 'read', 'criticism', 'how', 'shows', 'formula', 'was', 'getting', 'stale', 'show', 'needed', 'Dexter', 'take', 'bigger', 'risk', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'more', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'Well', 'two', 'episodes', 'started', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'started', 'wonder', 'show', 'had', 'fallen', 'trap', 'predictability', 'Showtime', 'network', 'thought', 'was', 'safe', 'would', ""n't"", 'anger', 'fans', 'spoilers', 'then', 'Lumen', 'story', 'only', 'way', 'dynamic', 'character', 'could', 'entire', 'Dexter', 'life', 'first', 'time', 'season', 'five', 'witnessed', 'actor', 'display', 'emotions', 'did', 'not', 'doubt', 'second', 'Lumen', 'brought', 'breath', 'life', 'season', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'story', 'only', 'better', 'better', 'mean', 'come', 'got', 'Robo', 'Cop', 'well', 'not', 'quite', 'great', 'bully', 'thought', 'casting', 'season', 'was', 'tremendous.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'anymore', 'already', 'have', 'have', 'say', 'many', 'ways', 'season', 'went', 'lot', 'further', 'expectations', 'only', 'downside', 'now', 'have', 'finished', 'watching', 'season', 'five', 'have', 'very', 'long', 'wait', 'season', 'six', 'released.This', 'season', 'was', 'full', 'twist', 'more', 'handful', 'moments', 'will', 'leave', 'jaw', 'floor']",N/A

While last season was dominated by the presence of John Lithgow, the shining star of and surprise of this season is the presence of Julia Stiles as Lumen, an abused victim who escapes her abusers and pledges to join Dexter in 'stabbing out' her revenge.  The writing is tighter and the subplots or sidebars are far more interesting: the many different love entanglements keep your head spinning.  The fellow workers with Dexter (Michael C.Hall) remain the same - Jennifer Carpenter (the real Mrs Hall), Desmond Harrington, David Zayas, Lauren Velez, CS Lee, and James Remar - all better than ever.  But the added attraction characters this year include Maria Doyle Kennedy (from The Tudors) as the nanny for Dexter's son, and Jonny Lee Miller as a twisted Inspirational Coach.The premise of following a serial killer who chooses as his victims criminals who would have otherwise not been punished is by now, after four seasons, a character we can all understand - emotionally, motivationally, and as a brilliant law enforcement team member. But the coups of the season was the addition of Julia Stiles who does some of the finest work of her career here. Enough said. The suspense is what drives this show!

Dexter is always a fun and watchable show even when it doesn't attain to heights past, and this season is no exception.  While seasons 2 and 3 were highlights for me I stopped taking it too seriously by season 4 and continued to watch season 5 with the same appreciative attitude that I'd read a comic book with.  I enjoy it but I don't expect John Grisham.  So before mentioning its flaws let me just say that I did enjoy the season overall.  Season 5 however doesn't start with or go out with the bang of previous seasons.With the cataclysmic ending of Season 4 I think most were expecting more of a riveting follow-up though I honestly I don't know exactly what more there was to follow up - and the season starts off with a pretty ho-hum initial episode where there's an overlong by-the-numbers mourning period that takes up pretty much the whole episode.  The 10 episodes between that and the last one however build up a fairly decent storyline with Jordan Chase, the psycho self-helf guru from hell.  As long as you expect the unprobable as probable you'll have fun watching he and Dexter's cat and mouse game.The introduction of Lumen as Dexter's new love made a certain amount of sense, though at the same time I understand reviewers that found her character kind of annoying, as I did also.  But worse than her character as a character, was her romantic relationship with Dexter.  For all they go through together, their love for each other never really comes off.  So much so that by the last episode, her fate (at the writer's hands) certainly comes as no surprise.  Final scenes between her and Dexter were somewhat chuckle-able. Needless to say the first and last episodes in this season are not its high point, though I did think the very last scene itself came off well.  Also worth mention is the former detective that Quinn hires to scope out Dexter.  He was a pretty tough and believably good semi-villain - more formidable on screen than Jordan Chase most of the time and added good subplot tension to the story.Season 5 is certainly worth the watch if you enjoyed previous seasons (as if I needed to say that) and I'll be catching season 6 when that comes out without a doubt.  It'll be interesting to see where the writers decide to go with the show after this as there really isn't much of a hook leading into the next season short of Deb and Quinn's near-confirmed suspicions about Dexter.  Some good ""could be"" double-meaning word play by Deb in the last episode. And Quinn certainly knows who saved his @ss, as does Dexter.  That may or may not provide fodder for season 6 and it will be interesting to see how or if this is going to make the show any more intriguing.",4,Dexterous,1293321600,"12 26, 2010",2010,2782,"[""'m"", 'gon', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'relation', 'other', 'Dexter', 'seasons', ""'d"", 'understand', '3', 'Dexter', 'always', 'fun', 'watchable', 'show', 'even', 'when', ""n't"", 'attain', 'heights', 'season', 'exception', 'seasons', '2', '3', 'were', 'highlights', 'stopped', 'taking', 'too', 'seriously', 'season', '4', 'continued', 'watch', 'season', '5', 'same', 'appreciative', 'attitude', ""'d"", 'read', 'comic', 'book', 'enjoy', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'John', 'Grisham', 'So', 'mentioning', 'flaws', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'did', 'enjoy', 'season', 'overall', 'Season', '5', 'however', ""n't"", 'start', 'go', 'out', 'bang', 'previous', 'seasons.With', 'cataclysmic', 'ending', 'Season', '4', 'think', 'most', 'were', 'expecting', 'more', 'riveting', 'follow-up', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'more', 'was', 'follow', 'up', 'season', 'off', 'pretty', 'ho-hum', 'initial', 'episode', 'where', 'overlong', 'by-the-numbers', 'mourning', 'period', 'up', 'pretty', 'much', 'whole', 'episode', '10', 'episodes', 'last', 'one', 'however', 'build', 'up', 'fairly', 'decent', 'storyline', 'Jordan', 'Chase', 'psycho', 'self-helf', 'guru', 'hell', 'As', 'long', 'expect', 'unprobable', 'probable', ""'ll"", 'have', 'fun', 'watching', 'Dexter', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game.The', 'introduction', 'Lumen', 'Dexter', 'new', 'love', 'made', 'certain', 'amount', 'sense', 'though', 'same', 'time', 'understand', 'reviewers', 'found', 'character', 'kind', 'annoying', 'did', 'also', 'worse', 'character', 'character', 'was', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Dexter', 'go', 'together', 'love', 'other', 'never', 'really', 'off', 'So', 'much', 'last', 'episode', 'fate', 'writer', 'hands', 'certainly', 'surprise', 'Final', 'scenes', 'Dexter', 'were', 'somewhat', 'chuckle-able', 'Needless', 'say', 'first', 'last', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'not', 'high', 'point', 'did', 'think', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'came', 'off', 'well', 'Also', 'worth', 'mention', 'former', 'detective', 'Quinn', 'scope', 'out', 'Dexter', 'was', 'pretty', 'tough', 'believably', 'good', 'semi-villain', 'more', 'formidable', 'screen', 'Jordan', 'Chase', 'most', 'time', 'added', 'good', 'subplot', 'tension', 'story.Season', '5', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watch', 'enjoyed', 'previous', 'seasons', 'needed', 'say', ""'ll"", 'be', 'catching', 'season', '6', 'when', 'out', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'where', 'writers', 'decide', 'go', 'show', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'hook', 'leading', 'next', 'season', 'short', 'Deb', 'Quinn', 'near-confirmed', 'suspicions', 'Dexter', 'good', 'could', 'be', 'double-meaning', 'word', 'play', 'Deb', 'last', 'episode', 'Quinn', 'certainly', 'who', 'saved', '@', 'ss', 'Dexter', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'provide', 'fodder', 'season', '6', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'going', 'make', 'show', 'more', 'intriguing']",N/A

The horrifying closing moments of Season 4 still seared onto our brains, we turn to Season 5 to see how Dexter Morgan is coping. And could it be that our self-avowed monster is wracked with guilt over Rita's death? Seems so. The opening episode, which immediately picks up from Season 4, finds him in a distraught state. To make matters worse, Rita's daughter, Aster, blames him for her death.But the story arc must evolve, and soon those dark urges roil up to the surface. Dexter stumbles onto a serial killer case, of which investigation gradually brings him out of his deep funk. His day job as a blood spatter analyst at Miami Metro PD also has him involved with a rash of beheadings in a Venezuelan neighborhood. But it's the first one, the Barrel Girl case, which propels this season. Because it's while pursuing the Barrel Girl case that Dexter would inadvertently rescue a kidnapped, near crazed girl named Lumen Ann Pierce (a strong Julia Stiles). Dexter perceives a fellow Dark Passenger within Lumen. Lumen is obsessed with finding and punishing her asssailants, and a reluctant Dexter decides to help her, possibly partly to atone for his having failed Rita. Although the prevailing thought then may have been: Huh. Picking up another co-conspirator... look how well that turned out the last time with Jimmy Smits.Except that, as good as Jimmy Smits was, this season's big bad really made my skin crawl. Jonny Lee Miller plays a charismatic self-help guru who may or may not be a criminal mastermind (but who are we kiddin'?). Miller injects a disturbing fastidiousness into his character which ramps up the skin crawl factor by several degrees. He's one of them folks what loves to manipulate people into performing depraved acts. He likes to watch. Creeeeeepy. The vile stuff he's wrought compels even someone as alienated as Dexter make this observation: ""Despite having considered myself a monster for as long as I can remember, it still comes as a shock when I'm confronted with the depth of evil that exists in this world.""The rest of the cast? Jennifer Carpenter as Dexter's profane yet fragile detective sister continues to be a favorite. I hate that she gets closer to her partner Quinn who isn't at all a substitute for Sgt. Doakes. Still, Quinn does his best Doakes impression as he begins to pry into Dexter's private business. Batista and LaGuerta's marital situation also becomes a focus of the show, which is a good thing if you like the couple (Me, I like Batista). Peter Weller signs on as a season-long guest star, playing a shady shamus who sniffs out some nasty things about Dexter. Except that this is a series in which guest stars rarely ever make a return appearance. They usually end up taped up on Dexter's table and getting their cheeks sliced up.Season 5 doesn't achieve the heights of Season 4, how could it? The sublime John Lithgow won't be coming back. But this is still a triumphant season, highlighted by Dexter and Lumen's emotional interactions and Dexter's learning how to be a single parent. To me, the key episode is ""Everything is Illumenated."" It's the one that coalesced the main story arc for me. It cemented Lumen as a fascinating foil for Dex. I love the warehouse scene which showcases Dexter applying his knowledge of blood spatter to track down a fleeing baddie. I also really liked ""Teenage Wasteland"" which reconnects Dex to Aster. Don't get it twisted. The other ten episodes sparkle as well. I still can't believe it took me this long to start watching this show. It's certainly one of the best shows currently going on television. And if it's not THE best, it's certainly the most fiendishly fun.

Maybe developments here and there are great but the thing about Dexter is the main person who is the killer. Nothing can top Lithgow from season 4 and then also his brother in Season 1.

After the end of Season 4, I was really curious to see how things would be resolved... and I was really disappointed in Dexter. The character, not the show. Rita didn't deserve what happened, and the kids sure didn't, but I'm sorry, Dexter did. It was all his own fault. He thought so too, but I think he interpreted it wrong. Dexter was convinced that he should have killed Trinity when he had the chance and everything with Rita would have been OK. Technically that is true. But my problem is this: in the beginning the series fascinated me because, while Dexter was a killer, it was a strange sort of justice. He was killing killers who had gotten away with it... killers who had fallen through stupid cracks in the justice system or just disappeared. With Trinity, this was not the case. The police had only just found out about him. If Dexter had not been obsessed with ""satisfying his urge"" (as if another killer wouldn't come up soon enough), the cops would have found him. HIS OWN SISTER was what, 5 minutes away from cracking the case? It was just so evil of Dexter to take that away from her... especially since she was one of his victims. Deb and all of his victims - and there were tons of them - will never have their closure. Maybe ""justice was served,"" but as far as all the people who lost their loved ones know, the killer is still out there having the time of his life. They deserved to see him prosecuted. I expected all of this - left over from Season 4 - to be resolved. Instead, everyone seemed to forget everything as Dexter proceeded to create a whole new mess. This includes him jumping into bed with Lumen the second she got over being attacked. Wasn't one of his big issues in Season 1 that he was so damaged he had no interest in touching women? He sure got over Rita fast. Because it was on Showtime I guess. And all so Lumen could decide to just walk out at the end, when Dexter has fallen for her. I assume that was because Julia Stiles was a special guest star all season instead of a regular star, not because of anything that actually made sense in the plot, so they had to work it in somehow.Besides all that, I had to watch the whole season. I will have to check out Season 6 also, to see how it all ends, seeing how I can borrow it for free from my library. (I hope it ends and doesn't go on to a Season 7. It just hasn't lived up the the standard it started at. Not that it's really at Season 6 now anyway. 12 measly episodes isn't a real season.)",3,It's time for Dexter to get caught,1328140800,"02 2, 2012",2012,2611,"['was', 'addicted', 'show', 'episode', 'one', ""'d"", 'probably', 'give', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'five', 'stars', 'season', 'was', 'letdown', 'end', 'Season', '4', 'was', 'really', 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'would', 'be', 'resolved', 'was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'Dexter', 'character', 'not', 'show', 'Rita', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'what', 'happened', 'kids', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'sorry', 'Dexter', 'did', 'was', 'own', 'fault', 'thought', 'so', 'too', 'think', 'interpreted', 'wrong', 'Dexter', 'was', 'convinced', 'should', 'have', 'killed', 'Trinity', 'when', 'had', 'chance', 'everything', 'Rita', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'OK.', 'Technically', 'true', 'problem', 'beginning', 'series', 'fascinated', 'Dexter', 'was', 'killer', 'was', 'strange', 'sort', 'justice', 'was', 'killing', 'killers', 'who', 'had', 'gotten', 'away', 'killers', 'who', 'had', 'fallen', 'stupid', 'cracks', 'justice', 'system', 'just', 'disappeared', 'Trinity', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'police', 'had', 'only', 'just', 'found', 'out', 'Dexter', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'obsessed', 'satisfying', 'urge', 'killer', 'would', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'soon', 'enough', 'cops', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'HIS', 'OWN', 'SISTER', 'was', 'what', '5', 'minutes', 'away', 'cracking', 'case', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'evil', 'Dexter', 'take', 'away', 'especially', 'was', 'one', 'victims', 'Deb', 'victims', 'were', 'tons', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'closure', 'Maybe', 'justice', 'was', 'served', 'as', 'far', 'people', 'who', 'lost', 'loved', 'ones', 'know', 'killer', 'still', 'there', 'having', 'time', 'life', 'deserved', 'see', 'prosecuted', 'expected', 'left', 'Season', '4', 'be', 'resolved', 'Instead', 'everyone', 'seemed', 'forget', 'everything', 'Dexter', 'proceeded', 'create', 'whole', 'new', 'mess', 'jumping', 'bed', 'Lumen', 'second', 'got', 'being', 'attacked', 'Was', ""n't"", 'one', 'big', 'issues', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'so', 'damaged', 'had', 'interest', 'touching', 'women', 'sure', 'got', 'Rita', 'fast', 'was', 'Showtime', 'guess', 'so', 'Lumen', 'could', 'decide', 'just', 'walk', 'out', 'end', 'when', 'Dexter', 'fallen', 'assume', 'was', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'was', 'special', 'guest', 'star', 'season', 'instead', 'regular', 'star', 'not', 'anything', 'actually', 'made', 'sense', 'plot', 'had', 'work', 'somehow.Besides', 'had', 'watch', 'whole', 'season', 'will', 'have', 'check', 'out', 'Season', '6', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'seeing', 'how', 'can', 'borrow', 'free', 'library', 'hope', ""n't"", 'go', 'Season', '7', 'just', ""n't"", 'lived', 'up', 'standard', 'started', 'Not', 'really', 'Season', '6', 'now', 'anyway', '12', 'measly', 'episodes', ""n't"", 'real', 'season']",N/A
1352695,A2RJT770ZA4WQM,B003L77GRO,"J. A Bowen ""tabithajab""","[5, 7]","I started watching Season Five with apprehension.  ""How are they going to top the ""Trinity Killer"" seasons?"" was my main thought, and, at first, I was somewhat disappointed.  I felt that the writers were definitely twisting the plot to suit their needs in a way that was not believable -- Dexter saying ""It was me"" when the police discover poor Rita in the bathtub -- and of course, Quinn being the character who is on to Dexter when no one else seems to be the least bit suspicious.  I mean, come on, Dexter has a work schedule that gives new meaning to the word ""flextime"" -- no one else thinks he's a little weird?  But the amazing Michael C. Hall has such a grip on me, holding me enthralled as a viewer, that I had to keep watching.And I was so glad I did.  Julia Stiles has to be my favorite guest actor yet in this remarkable series, and her performance was so compelling, I couldn't even wait to watch each episode On Demand.  I had to watch it on Sunday night at 9.  I loved the way she developed from a victim in the throes of posttraumatic shock, so emotionally devastated from her experience she can hardly function, to part of Team Dexter.  The chemistry between she and Hall was palpable, and Episode 11, the next to the last, had me on the edge of my seat.Johnny Lee Miller as the corrupt and totally despicable Jordan Chase was rivetting, as was the ex-cop turned criminal informant played by Peter Weller (one of the stellar supporting roles in this season).  Some have criticized Miller's lack of character development as a flaw in the season, but I think the writers had to keep the plot moving without dragging Season Five out too long.  This may have been done because Julia Stiles was, unfortunately, only available to them for one season.The fact that Season Five ended as it did, with Julia Stiles' character Lumen leaving, is why I can't give this five stars.  This definitely needed another season.  Quinn backs off, he is also given a reprieve that defies reality, and it's as if the writers were just in a hurry to tie up all the plot lines a little too neatly.  There were other instances that needed more fleshing out, too.  The relationship between Angel and LaGuerta is annoying; I can't figure out if he's sleeping on the couch or they're really separated.  Little hints are dropped, but nothing is really revealed. The character of the Nanny, played by Maria Doyle Kennedy, another fine actress, also needs more work.  We saw her fearless confrontation of Dexter when he leaves her with Harrison all night without so much as a phone call.  Then, she turns into Mary Poppins and even goes with Harrison to Orlando to stay with the grandparents.  Aster goes from a girl on the brink of juvenile deliquency and irrational hatred of Dexter to the sweet kid you always wanted her to be in the blink of an eye, too.  It's not a problem with the excellent acting or writing; it's a problem of too little time to do it all.  And that is a shame, because with a series of this caliber, nothing should be left on the cutting room floor.",4,The Dark Passenger takes on a soul mate,1292198400,"12 13, 2010",2010,3060,"['started', 'watching', 'Season', 'Five', 'apprehension', 'How', 'are', 'going', 'top', 'Trinity', 'Killer', 'seasons', 'was', 'main', 'thought', 'first', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'felt', 'writers', 'were', 'definitely', 'twisting', 'plot', 'suit', 'needs', 'way', 'was', 'not', 'believable', 'Dexter', 'saying', 'was', 'when', 'police', 'discover', 'poor', 'Rita', 'bathtub', 'course', 'Quinn', 'being', 'character', 'who', 'Dexter', 'when', 'one', 'else', 'be', 'least', 'bit', 'suspicious', 'mean', 'come', 'Dexter', 'work', 'schedule', 'new', 'meaning', 'word', 'flextime', 'one', 'else', 'little', 'weird', 'amazing', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'grip', 'holding', 'enthralled', 'viewer', 'had', 'keep', 'watching.And', 'was', 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'be', 'favorite', 'guest', 'actor', 'yet', 'remarkable', 'series', 'performance', 'was', 'so', 'compelling', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'wait', 'watch', 'episode', 'Demand', 'had', 'watch', 'Sunday', 'night', '9', 'loved', 'way', 'developed', 'victim', 'throes', 'posttraumatic', 'shock', 'so', 'emotionally', 'devastated', 'experience', 'can', 'hardly', 'function', 'part', 'Team', 'Dexter', 'chemistry', 'Hall', 'was', 'palpable', 'Episode', '11', 'next', 'last', 'had', 'edge', 'seat.Johnny', 'Lee', 'Miller', 'corrupt', 'totally', 'despicable', 'Jordan', 'Chase', 'was', 'rivetting', 'was', 'ex-cop', 'turned', 'criminal', 'informant', 'played', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'one', 'stellar', 'supporting', 'roles', 'season', 'have', 'criticized', 'Miller', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'flaw', 'season', 'think', 'writers', 'had', 'keep', 'plot', 'moving', 'dragging', 'Season', 'Five', 'out', 'too', 'long', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'only', 'available', 'one', 'season.The', 'fact', 'Season', 'Five', 'ended', 'did', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'character', 'Lumen', 'leaving', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'definitely', 'needed', 'season', 'Quinn', 'off', 'also', 'given', 'reprieve', 'reality', 'writers', 'were', 'just', 'hurry', 'tie', 'up', 'plot', 'lines', 'little', 'too', 'neatly', 'were', 'other', 'instances', 'needed', 'more', 'fleshing', 'out', 'too', 'relationship', 'Angel', 'LaGuerta', 'annoying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'sleeping', 'couch', ""'re"", 'really', 'separated', 'Little', 'hints', 'are', 'dropped', 'nothing', 'really', 'revealed', 'character', 'Nanny', 'played', 'Maria', 'Doyle', 'Kennedy', 'fine', 'actress', 'also', 'more', 'work', 'saw', 'fearless', 'confrontation', 'Dexter', 'when', 'Harrison', 'night', 'so', 'much', 'phone', 'call', 'Then', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'even', 'Harrison', 'Orlando', 'stay', 'grandparents', 'Aster', 'girl', 'brink', 'juvenile', 'deliquency', 'irrational', 'hatred', 'Dexter', 'sweet', 'kid', 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'blink', 'eye', 'too', 'not', 'problem', 'excellent', 'acting', 'writing', 'problem', 'too', 'little', 'time', 'do', 'shame', 'series', 'caliber', 'nothing', 'should', 'be', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor']",N/A

Lowry,"[0, 1]","Season Five of Dexter was another great season of Dexter but the storylines seem to be more towards other people around Dexter then instead of Dexter as the main character.  I shall give a few examples Quinn sees Dexter torn up about the death of his wife and decides to look into Dexter's life outside of work with help of a fellow cop.  Dexter tries to break news to the kids about Rita's death and astor blows up at him.  They end up having two storylines threwout the whole season The Saint Death Muders with heads cup off, eyes cut out and tongue missing from heads.  Then the storyline featuring character Jordan Chase and all the dead girls in barrel's.  When Dexter kills a person finds a woman named Lumen who has been hurt by many people inculding Jordan Chase, so Dexter choices to help her with her problem to feel better about Rita's death.  Harrison Dexter's son starts to talk as he is with the nanny.  Dexter finds Astor and a gf drinking in the house, Lumen and Dexter start killing off Jordan's friends as trying to work up to killing Jordan.  But it's hard for Dexter and Lumen because of Quinn's cop friend following Dexter everywhere he goes.  Debra warns Jordan his friends are disappearing and he might be next on the person's list, Dexter takes care of Quinn's cop friend and then goes after Lumen and Jordan.  Dexter I do believe only killed two people this season, while leaving Lumen to kill a few also like a team working together to solve their problems.  But if you want to see still a good season of Dexter buy this and see for yourself still a killer season pardon the pun.

1352697,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,B003L77GRO,Jack E. Levic,"[1, 2]","Dexter's home life tragically came apart at the end of Season 4. How could the writers begin to top that intense season? Well, they did it as we continue to dig deeper into Dexter's psyche. The rules set up by his dad are evolving. Dexter is now showing emotion and will emotions cause him to make a careless mistake and finally get caught?Dexter is beginning to have feelings--his own versions of grief, sadness, joy, regret, and love. The writers take us on am amazing journey this season as we discover a new serial killer is menacing Miami. Poor Miami never seems to get a break. Their serial killings are rarely solved as the suspects disappear and the killings - all thanks to the work of Dexter. He is always one step ahead of his coworkers, especially his sister Deb who is particularly good at using her instincts to uncover the killer. It's Dexter's job to sabotage an investigation if the homicide team is getting too close to finding the killer.This season's star is the lovely Julia Stiles as Lumen. DEXTER has had some great guest stars throughout the seasons. Stiles brings a bit of humanity to Dexter. She lights up the screen with her beauty and passion, but what is the passion that she shares with Dexter? Dexter is motivated by his need to kill while following his father's ""rules."" Lumen has the need for revenge and closure. The two clash and collide and come together as one. The transformation in Dexter is remarkable. He and Lumen need each other and their chemistry is electrifying. I have to be vague in my review so as not to give away any details. Suffice to say that the viewer is in for some major surprises and the writers take us on an amazing journey. Twists and turns abound.

1352698,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B003L77GRO,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 1]","A new season, just like a new book, about Dexter or by his dear author, are treats that have the essence of pleasure and the texture of bliss and happiness. This fifth season is no exception especially with the final image of the previous season of Dexter's son, Harrison, in the blood of his mother and wife, respectively and backwardly, killed by the Trinity Killer just before he was abducted and liquidated if not terminated by Dexter who did not know what this trinity Killer had just done.From this traumatic scene opening this season we move onto another serial killer or rather a gang of serial killers who have been operating since high school or so and are still operating under the supervision and guidance of a TV positive thinker, one of these new prophets of the post-God era. These gurus who more or less mesmerize their clients into doing what they, the gurus, want them, the clients, to do in their, the guru's, places. It is tempting to have an inner circle of disciples with whom you share your real power, I mean the guru has the full power and the others execute the deepest bleakest darkest blackest desires the guru has and has been able to suggest or extract from the unconscious minds of the followers.It sounds religious, Christian in fact, but they push slightly further the parallelism and that gang of If-you-want-something-take-it-ters project the Christian nature onto their victims who are sacrificed in the perfect number of thirteen, the thirteenth victim evading the lot and the curse, so that we drop back to twelve, the proper number with the thirteenth traitor who will turn against the guru, and will be coming back with a dark angel to execute and terminate all the members of that gang, one by one. In fact it is even more vicious because the first victim has been mesmerized into accepting her link with the guru and she survived. That makes fourteen victims, the first surviving like a sort of Holy Virgin and even helping along, twelve dead after torture and a few other niceties, the last one surviving and treacherously coming back to bring justice, like the archangel Gabriel, the executor of God's sentences, with I guess the archangel Michael, the liquidator of dragons.This series does not work as a common thriller and what is important is not to learn who the real criminal is, why Dexter is going to execute this one or that one. We know that straight away, from the very start. The point here is to know how Dexter is going to get out of the intricate complicated and very obscure and precarious situations he is putting himself in. And this season is great as for that. But I am not going to reveal these details.What is more interesting is that the thirteenth victim and Dexter are going to be fellow-travelers on the dark passage of the dark passenger. But is it going to be the meeting of one's life time or is it going to be transient and evanescent? Is she going to be the new woman in his life? On the other side Harrison has to be taken care of and he is growing. The problem is the nanny because he needs a nanny since his grand parents have taken the other older two children and can't take this one, and since Deborah has a full time job at the Miami Metropolitan Police. But that's a small complication in the life of a really busy young man who has two professions, both exacting and demanding.The best part of this series is that we have divided loyalties. We are absolutely on the side of the police and Deborah who are for catching criminals and bringing them to justice, but at the same time we are absolutely behind Dexter who considers that we are supposed to save tax payer money and avoid bringing those criminals to justice. But, if we are for that kind of a twist in the fabric of justice and law-enforcement, we are well obliged to be on the side of the small or big twists in police work to simplify a situation that is too complicated for a colleague, who is innocent of course of any crime, just awkwardly compromised by his or her lack of swiftness, or to decide to let some criminals run because they are just cleaning up the dirty place in which we live and this is ethical, cheap and efficacious. What's more it attacks most of the time, in this case particularly, people who have the necessary means to have the best lawyers and evade criminal justice like a certain DSK in New York.One thing is sure: quite a few people disappear in the USA without leaving any tracks or footprints behind and no one seems to care about it, provided these disappearing characters are proved vicious criminals of any type. This seems to reveal something about the American-ness of this series. The objective is to catch the criminals - if the police and justice can - or to let some vigilante liquidate them - if the police or justice are too slow. This is typically American efficiency and practicality: the objective is to reach the target and the goal at the lowest price possible and in the shortest time possible and with as few collateral damage as possible. At times this practicality and efficiency create impossible situation like in Vietnam, Iraq or Afghanistan, but there is always a rub somewhere in the carpet of life.But the best part remains the opening credits that have not changed from the very first episode, especially the admirable mechanical mosquito, and the music of the whole series. Long live our Dexter International, registered and unlicensable trade mark and copyrighted character. After all he could be some night partner of ours on some winter nights when we are alone and cold in our beds and need some distraction, more than entertainment. And distracted you will be by this aging young man who manipulates knives like a magician as if they were pencils or toothpicks.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Gruesome is beautiful,1315872000,"09 13,

EVERY episode ends in a cliff-hanger, which leaves you wanting more.The performances are superb, especially from Golden-Globe nominee Julia Stiles, who plays torture/rape victim Lumen Pierce, who is trying to heal by helping Dexter hunt down her sadistic cadre of attackers before they can torture and kill any more women. Watching her transformation from shriveling rape victim to beautiful, vengeful warrior over 12 episodes is an absolute joy to behold. She and Dexter are electrifying.Other honorable mentions: Peter Weller as crooked cop scumbag Frank Liddy trying to uncover Dexter's extracurricular activities.C.S. Lee as Vince Masuka, absolutely hilarious in his crazy attempts to unravel crime scenes from his own perverted perspective.

Up until this season as far as I was concerned the show could do no wrong. Don't get me wrong, it's still better than most stuff you will watch, it's just not up to the ""Dexter"" standard. My problems with this season, caution, mild spoiler alert!! Something had to be done, but the first two episodes were a bit too heavy for ""Dexter"". They should have been pulled back from a bit or offset with a more upbeat parallel story line. The first two episodes left be a bit more bummed out than I am looking for from Dexter. Another issue I had was I have no idea where Lumen got her money to ""survive"" from. It was never explained, and considering her circumstances should have been. It was written like she had none (needed help from Dexter) but see seemed to have no problem coming up with enough cash to rent hotel rooms, buy clothes, expensive coffee a gun, etc. It just didn't make a ton of sense. And last but certainly not least, overall the Dexter's character was taken in a direction of ""having feelings"". I can understand why the writers took things in that direction. They wanted to make him more human and evolving characters is one of the basics when it comes to writing. The problem in this case is Dexter is a SOCIOPATH! Sociopaths don't develop feelings, that's what makes them sociopaths. I would have been far more impressed if Dexter incorporated sorrow, grief, guilt, etc into his outward persona to blend in (like he has in the past). But I can't swallow that he is becoming more ""human"", sociopaths don't do that. So in this case I think the writers did Dexter's character a disservice and are loosing sight of who he really is. There are many more examples like these, but I don't want to rant. In addition to the story issues there were some inexcusable editing mistakes. Things like ""Hey, that car wasn't parked like that in the other camera angle"". Or, ""That was not in his hand in the last shot"". And when exactly did Dexter's SUV window get magically fixed??? Those little things drive me nuts and that is not what I expect from the series. Showtime needs to tighten the ship up a bit.That being said it was still worth every dollar and I about watched it all the way though. I hope next season Dexter gets back to ""Dexter"" a little better. Back to basics if you will. I think the ""Touchy Feely"" stuff has run its course.

One, Jennifer Carpenter is the show's biggest asset and the reason I continued to watch, even as Michael C. Hall's acting and character became tired.  Two, the show was dismissive of minority characters, not just in the plot lines but in the credits at the beginning of the show. I have a problem with that when those characters were much more compelling than the title character and the white characters.  I would have rather that Doakes stayed, learned more about LaGuerta, Angel and Mazuka instead of the oftentimes tired battle between Dexter and the season's villain.  The show was best when it mixed the season long villain with frequent one-episode villains that Dexter took care of quick (as in the earlier seasons).Also, there are no subtitles, even though Showtime says there are and the 'extras' are so minimal it's like a slap in the face.",5,Dexter is my hero. **updated 121913**,1322870400,"12 3, 2011",2011,1494,"['Dexter', 'creative', 'momentum', 'even', 'whole', 'new', 'team', 'writers', 'who', 'replaced', 'team', 'seasons', '1-4', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'performance', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'sister', 'character', 'brilliantly', 'annoyingly', 'heroically', 'big', 'part', 'why', 'love', 'show', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Jonny', 'Lee', 'Miller', 'were', 'outstanding', 'guest', 'stars', '**update', '121913**FYI', 'Dexter', 'SERIOUSLY', 'downhill', 'season', '7', '6th', 'season', 'all-time', 'low', 'Season', '7', 'tiny', 'bit', 'better', 'Season', '8', 'better', '7', 'overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'seasons', '1-5', 'really', '1-4', '.Two', 'things', ""'ve"", 'noted', 'show', 'progressed', 'One', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'show', 'biggest', 'asset', 'reason', 'continued', 'watch', 'even', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'acting', 'character', 'became', 'tired', 'Two', 'show', 'was', 'dismissive', 'minority', 'characters', 'not', 'just', 'plot', 'lines', 'credits', 'beginning', 'show', 'have', 'problem', 'when', 'characters', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'compelling', 'title', 'character', 'white', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'Doakes', 'stayed', 'learned', 'more', 'LaGuerta', 'Angel', 'Mazuka', 'instead', 'oftentimes', 'tired', 'battle', 'Dexter', 'season', 'villain', 'show', 'was', 'best', 'when', 'mixed', 'season', 'long', 'villain', 'frequent', 'one-episode', 'villains', 'Dexter', 'took', 'care', 'quick', 'earlier', 'seasons', '.Also', 'are', 'subtitles', 'even', 'Showtime', 'are', ""'extras"", 'are', 'so', 'minimal', 'slap', 'face']",N/A

1352720,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B003L77GRO,Kasey G,"[4, 6]","After the previous season ends with Rita dead in a virtual bloodbath, Season Five of ""Dexter"" opens with our favorite serial killer struggling with guilt and trying to avoid suspicion for his wife's death (particularly from Quinn). The way Astor and Cody and their grandparents react to Rita's death is not very believable. No one seems to show an appropriate degree of grief. It's as though Dexter's lack of emotion has rubbed off on everyone else.Deb and Quinn develop serious feelings for each other but that gets complicated when Deb discovers Quinn's enlisted a crooked cop to spy on Dex. Battista and Laguerta struggle to balance work and home lives and their marriage becomes strained. Masuka never fails to disappoint as the comic relief (watch for the scene as he pantomimes the fundamentals of auto-erotic asphyxiation).It takes a surprisingly long time for the writers to establish the season's main story arc. Up to that point, the ""B"" story is more interesting with bizarre ritual murders involving decapitations and eye-gougings. There is more genuine suspense when the gang ambush a seedy apartment complex and stake out a hopping nightclub.Nearly mid-season, Dexter gets an unwelcome accomplice in the form of rape victim Lumen Pierce (Julia Stiles), who has witnessed him offing one of the men who raped and tortured her. It eventually becomes apparent to Dex that Lumen is carrying her own ""Dark Passenger"" and worms her way into his killing ritual. It's great to finally see Dexter be allowed to show his true colours to another with the Julia Stiles character; something he never experienced with Rita. Dexter ends up playing cat-and-mouse with a dangerous adversary (again) but even though there's a twist this time because of his female conspirator, it's been done before and much better in previous years.""Dexter"" is still a great show; the acting is perfect, but some of the storylines are becoming repetitive. I'd say Season 4 was the series' peak. The Trinity Killer storyline was so well-executed the tension and suspense was almost unbearable at times. I doubt they can top it. Unless they can re-invent the show and go in a somewhat different direction like ""Weeds"", the producers should probably pack it in after next season.I wasn't as enthralled with this season as I was the others because the excitement and suspense just wasn't there and the writing and plot wasn't as cohesive.

It's no surprise that Season 4 is rated ""four stars"": almost everyone with any critical thinking skills stopped watching after season 3, so all that's left are the people who'd rave about how wonderful it is no matter what.Here's the truth of the matter, though: Season 4 meanders around aimlessly for the entire first half of the season, with almost no focus whatsoever.  When the writers finally get around to trying to establish an arc for the season, they do so in the laziest way imaginable: Dexter randomly notices a stain in the back of a U-Haul that he's renting, and instantly assumes a serial killer murdered someone in it.  Surprise surprise, he's right.  The problem is that it's later shown that the killer never transported the bodies in the U-Haul, and killed his victims via electrocution.Then there's the endless scenes of Deb accidentally running into Dexter within ten feet of a dead body, and never once cluing in to the idea that maybe it's not a coincidence.  These scenes were there entirely for the ""next week on Dexter"" teasers, so they could push the silly ""Will THIS be the week Deb discovers that Dexter is a killer?"" red herring.Now, very few of the other people commenting on this season seem to have a issue with any of this.

1352746,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B003L77GRO,Melissa Niksic,"[6, 9]","I didn't think ""Dexter"" could possibly top Season 4, and I was right. Although Season 5 was a good season, I think it could have been a lot better. For the first time ever, the show disappointed me. (Warning: This review will contain some spoilers, so proceed with caution.)Season 5 picks up right where Season 4 left off...Dexter (Michael C. Hall) has discovered his wife Rita's dead body in the bathtub of their home, the final victim of the Trinity Killer. The only person who believes Dexter knows more about Rita than he's letting on is Quinn (Desmond Harrington), who does some digging into Dexter's personal life and eventually hires a shady private investigator to snoop around a bit more. However, Quinn's growing feelings for Debra (Jennifer Carpenter) force him to back off from Dexter, but it may be too late.Meanwhile, Dexter copes with being on his own, being a single father of three, and still finding time to devote to his Dark Passenger. He begins an unusual friendship with Lumen (guest star Julia Stiles), a young woman who has been through a terrible ordeal and becomes a way for Dexter to try and atone for Rita's death.The storyline in Season 5 is a good one, and I really liked the addition of Lumen's character, along with the budding relationship between Deb and Quinn. However, a lot of things annoyed me about this season. Angel and LaGuerta's characters drove me crazy the entire time. I always liked Angel and never liked Maria until she hooked up with Angel in Season 4, but this season Maria went back to being her usual conniving self, and the relationship drama between her and Angel was super boring. Also, I was looking forward to more ""Dexter as a single dad"" issues on the show, but the writers shooed Aster and Cody out the door in a few quick episodes. I would have liked to have seen more of Aster turning into a troubled pre-teen and Dexter having to deal with all of her dramatic girl problems.More than that, though, what really bugged me was all of the ridiculous situations this season that required an extreme suspension of disbelief from the audience. The writers don't seem to care if their plots have 50,000 holes in them. Too many things happened in the show that made no sense at all, and things that should have been dealt with on a much larger scale were just swept under the rug and forgotten about by all parties involved. Here are just a few examples:1. When Dexter and Lumen are in the warehouse and Deb shows up with her cop entourage, the vigilante duo have no problem slipping out of the warehouse sight unseen. Why didn't Miami Metro have the place surrounded? Makes no sense.2. What was up with Jordan Chase wearing Emily's blood around her neck? What really happened to her so many years ago, and why was she still so devoted to Jordan until the bitter end? Why didn't the writers explain ANY of this?!3. When Liddy turns up dead and Quinn refuses to answer questions and insists on getting a lawyer, everyone just forgets about that as soon as the blood on his shoe comes back as someone else's. Quinn just gets to walk away and go on with his life. Wouldn't Deb, Maria, or anyone else be a little curious about why Quinn's name was on Liddy's surveillance equipment or why Liddy called Quinn five times right before he was killed? No one seems to care about that at all.4. The biggest thing that bugs me is how close Deb came to catching Dexter in the act. The only way this season could have trumped Season 4 is if Deb had come face to face with Dexter and Lumen in the camp, and that didn't happen. Obviously Quinn knows that something is up with Dexter, but it seems like he's willing to keep his mouth shut because he loves Deb and because he's smart enough to stay on Dexter's good side. However, he or Deb really should have found out the truth about Dexter this time around. It needs to happen. In the books the series is based on, Deb finds out the truth about Dexter right away. Her obliviousness to the situation has dragged on for five seasons. It's time for her to wise up.I know I am being super critical, but I think ""Dexter"" is one of the best shows in all of television history, and I hold it to an extremely high standard. Season 5 did have its moments, and I really did enjoy it, but it was not the same standard of quality as the first four seasons of the show. I hope the writers get it together for Season 6, because I would hate to see this show die a slow and painful death.",4,My least favorite season of the show thus far,1292198400,"12 13, 2010",2010,4463,"['did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Dexter', 'could', 'possibly', 'top', 'Season', '4', 'was', 'right', 'Season', '5', 'was', 'good', 'season', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'show', 'disappointed', 'Warning', 'review', 'will', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'so', 'proceed', 'caution', 'Season', '5', 'picks', 'up', 'right', 'where', 'Season', '4', 'left', 'off', 'Dexter', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'discovered', 'wife', 'Rita', 'dead', 'body', 'bathtub', 'home', 'final', 'victim', 'Trinity', 'Killer', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'Dexter', 'more', 'Rita', 'letting', 'Quinn', 'Desmond', 'Harrington', 'who', 'digging', 'Dexter', 'personal', 'life', 'eventually', 'shady', 'private', 'investigator', 'snoop', 'around', 'bit', 'more', 'However', 'Quinn', 'growing', 'feelings', 'Debra', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'force', 'back', 'off', 'Dexter', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'late.Meanwhile', 'Dexter', 'being', 'own', 'being', 'single', 'father', 'three', 'still', 'finding', 'time', 'devote', 'Dark', 'Passenger', 'unusual', 'friendship', 'Lumen', 'guest', 'star', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'terrible', 'ordeal', 'way', 'Dexter', 'try', 'atone', 'Rita', 'death.The', 'storyline', 'Season', '5', 'good', 'one', 'really', 'liked', 'addition', 'Lumen', 'character', 'budding', 'relationship', 'Deb', 'Quinn', 'However', 'lot', 'things', 'annoyed', 'season', 'Angel', 'LaGuerta', 'characters', 'drove', 'crazy', 'entire', 'time', 'always', 'liked', 'Angel', 'never', 'liked', 'Maria', 'hooked', 'up', 'Angel', 'Season', '4', 'season', 'Maria', 'went', 'back', 'being', 'usual', 'conniving', 'self', 'relationship', 'drama', 'Angel', 'was', 'super', 'boring', 'Also', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'more', 'Dexter', 'single', 'dad', 'issues', 'show', 'writers', 'shooed', 'Aster', 'Cody', 'door', 'few', 'quick', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'Aster', 'turning', 'troubled', 'pre-teen', 'Dexter', 'having', 'deal', 'dramatic', 'girl', 'problems.More', 'though', 'what', 'really', 'bugged', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'situations', 'season', 'required', 'extreme', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'audience', 'writers', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'plots', 'have', '50,000', 'holes', 'Too', 'many', 'things', 'happened', 'show', 'made', 'sense', 'things', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'dealt', 'much', 'larger', 'scale', 'were', 'just', 'swept', 'rug', 'forgotten', 'parties', 'involved', 'Here', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'examples:1', 'When', 'Dexter', 'Lumen', 'are', 'warehouse', 'Deb', 'up', 'cop', 'entourage', 'vigilante', 'duo', 'have', 'problem', 'slipping', 'warehouse', 'sight', 'unseen', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Miami', 'Metro', 'have', 'place', 'surrounded', 'Makes', 'sense.2', 'What', 'was', 'up', 'Jordan', 'Chase', 'wearing', 'Emily', 'blood', 'neck', 'What', 'really', 'happened', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'why', 'was', 'still', 'so', 'devoted', 'Jordan', 'bitter', 'end', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'writers', 'explain', 'ANY', '3', 'When', 'Liddy', 'up', 'dead', 'Quinn', 'answer', 'questions', 'insists', 'getting', 'lawyer', 'everyone', 'just', 'forgets', 'about', 'as', 'soon', 'blood', 'shoe', 'back', 'someone', 'else', 'Quinn', 'just', 'walk', 'away', 'go', 'life', 'Would', ""n't"", 'Deb', 'Maria', 'anyone', 'else', 'be', 'little', 'curious', 'why', 'Quinn', 'name', 'was', 'Liddy', 'surveillance', 'equipment', 'why', 'Liddy', 'called', 'Quinn', 'five', 'times', 'right', 'was', 'killed', 'one', 'care', 'all.4', 'biggest', 'thing', 'bugs', 'how', 'close', 'Deb', 'came', 'catching', 'Dexter', 'act', 'only', 'way', 'season', 'could', 'have', 'trumped', 'Season', '4', 'Deb', 'had', 'come', 'face', 'face', 'Dexter', 'Lumen', 'camp', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Obviously', 'Quinn', 'something', 'up', 'Dexter', 'willing', 'keep', 'mouth', 'shut', 'Deb', 'smart', 'enough', 'stay', 'Dexter', 'good', 'side', 'However', 'Deb', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'found', 'out', 'truth', 'Dexter', 'time', 'around', 'happen', 'books', 'series', 'based', 'Deb', 'out', 'truth', 'Dexter', 'right', 'away', 'obliviousness', 'situation', 'dragged', 'five', 'seasons', 'time', 'wise', 'up.I', 'know', 'am', 'being', 'super', 'critical', 'think', 'Dexter', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'television', 'history', 'hold', 'extremely', 'high', 'standard', 'Season', '5', 'did', 'have', 'moments', 'really', 'did', 'enjoy', 'was', 'not', 'same', 'standard', 'quality', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'show', 'hope', 'writers', 'get', 'together', 'Season', '6', 'would', 'hate', 'see', 'show', 'slow', 'painful', 'death']",N/A

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the show a lot. But Dexter is becoming really kind of obnoxious sometimes (other than kis killer-nature, of course).He's beginning to make foul play of current investigations made by their pals at Miami Police, just for the sake of himself killing the guys. It was first stablished that he killed guilty people that got away from justice. A kind of Punisher.But now, he kills the Robocop (Peter Weller) character without any remorse. Ok, the guy was not a very good cop, but was not a killer in any way, and wanted to use Dexter, by denouncing him, to return to his police job. And Dexter killed him mercilessly. And the fact that Quinn had phoned the guy a lot of times just minutes before his death is simply forgotten by his friends. This is the single most annoying point in the whole season.Another atrocious plot line is the LaGuerta/Angel subplot. Soap opera at its worst. As for Debra, I'd like to know how such a ""charming"" and ""polite"" and ""adorable"" girl has guys falling in love for her all the time. But Jennifer is acting very good this season.The Leman character did its part, but it all felt contrived. Ok, the atrocities the guys did with her were uninmaginable, but she went to Dexter mode only to satisfy her rage, and fastly saying to Dexter that she was satisfied and the urge to kill passed.

1352748,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B003L77GRO,Michael Butts,"[0, 0]","DEXTER's fifth season is quite different than its four predecessors.  The theme seems to be about redemption and new starts.  After the tragic loss of Rita, Dexter faces a whole new world.  He's now a single parent.  Still a forensic blood specialist.  Still a serial killer.  After stumbling onto a heinous fellow serial killer (Shawn Hatosy), he rescues a future victim from her plight, sending him on a missioin of vengeance and providing him with a partner in crime.  This main plot is joined by subplots that involve Quinn's hiring of a bad cop to get info on Dexter's possible involvement in Rita's death; a blossoming romance between Deb and Quinn; Astor's rejection of Dexter; a stormy marriage for Angel and Laguerta; and a series of brutal murders unrelated to Dexter's deeds.As always, DEXTER is well done with intricate plot twists.  Michael C. Hall is brilliant in handling the complexity of his character, the most intriguimg anti-hero in television history.  The cast of regulars all have their shining moments this season, especially Jennifer Carpenter and Desmond Harrington.  Julia Stiles as Lumen is fabulous--a revelation of her acting abilities.  ELI STONE's Jonny Lee Miller is also excellent as the twisted motivational speaker Jordan Chase.

1352771,ABBBP0HLLXJZ9,B003L77GRO,"Rhonda Poynter ""gannon'smom""","[150, 187]","Firstly, this is the best show on television, plain and simple. I came to it late, discovering just a little over two years ago, and so I've had to catch up - I completely agree with the many, many reviews on different sites which really go after the quality of the DVDs for ""Dexter"", by the way. If you can get Blu, do so. Now, a series about a serial killer didn't quite seem like my kind of trip when I first began watching ""Dexter"", but this show quickly pulls you in with excellent acting, writing and directing. (Trivia: Are any of you old enough to remember the geeky guy who lets his haunted car, Christine, take over his life and get even at everybody else, in the Stephen King classic, ""Christine""? That actor, Keith Gordon, is the same man directing this series. Anyhow!) Michael C. Hall is nothing less than superb as the tortured title character, and he continues hitting it out of the ballpark this season, despite having spent the majority of this last year or so sick as a dog and undergoing chemotherapy in real life for leukemia. (His agent says that he's doing well, right now). As we all know from decades of anti-heroes, the audience has to like a killer (Warren Beatty as Clyde Barrow, for instance), or watching this type of show is going to leave you with a - well, weird feeling: I've seen shows, both fictional and biographical, where the 'hero' was so revolting an individual that I couldn't figure out why anybody thought he/she deserved a show, and I had to take a shower after watching the piece of garbage. This series is so well-written that even though we know Dexter is a bad man - he himself constantly describes himself as a 'monster' -, he is redeemed in our eyes by wanting a normal life, by wanting to be a good family man, even - as in this season -, becoming an avenger of sorts to another individual who is as troubled as he is, the gangrape survivor, Lumen. Lumen is portrayed by Julia Stiles, and I did not know her work before this, and she has quickly become a contender in my list of favorites - she plays Lumen with the perfect pitch, and the viewer (SPOILER) truly follows the character as she goes from victim to terrified survivor, to vigilante to trusting Dexter, et al. I found myself conflicted by this specific plotline of the season - Would our 'good' Dexter actually teach somebody else what he knows, and how to kill? It took me a few episodes to realize that yes, Dexter, with his tangled ideals of justice and self-preservation, would think that the right thing to teach a victim would not so much be revenge, but...how to make certain she is never a victim again. I think that this series is truly an example of the ""What would I do?"" school, rather than simple slash and trash; non-fans of the show say that we read too much into the series, but there are many, many things to think about when watching it. I suppose the simplest point to make would be that this is a thinking man's series, and it addresses the fact that we may not like having to admit it, but there are people out there who do bad things to other people, for no palpable reason other than to be evil. Then there's Dexter - admittedly, usually more on celluloid than in the real world - promising us that at least a few of those evil people will never get near our kids. In today's Armageddon-round-the-corner way of thinking, Michael C. Hall, therefore, portrays a fascinating character who both intrigues us and frightens us, and - admit it - more than a few of us are hoping that everything will, in some odd draw of the Fate cards, will work out for him. This, then is a successful antihero, and the show should be seen as more than a small screen slasher flick. It is very rough in language, there are plenty of sexual situations, etc., and so remember all that if the blood stuff hasn't been enough of a warning that this is not a show for the kids.

1352772,A3VVNYI2J1AMD8,B003L77GRO,RMB,"[10, 13]","First, let me say I love the show Dexter. I have watched each season from the beginning and even before the show I was reading the books. I also enjoyed the fifth season of Dexter. The show is fantastic and I couldn't say enough good things about it and its wonderful cast. What marrs this dvd set is the way Showtime has loaded it with episodes from other shows they want to sell on dvd while they leave off any good extras for Dexter and force the buyer to go online to view them, and their forced feeding of their show promos at the start of the dvds. It seems Showtime has engineered this dvd set so every time you load a dvd from it you are forced to watch their show promos before the menu loads. Other dvds allow the viewer to fast forward or skip over the promos, or at least speed them up to get to the episode menu, but Showtime has blocked that. Now everytime  you want to watch Dexter season five you have to watch the same stupid promo ads with no hope of avoiding them. As for the dvd 'extras', showtime should have put the Dexter season five specific extras on the disks like everyone else does, but instead you have to load the dvd into your computer to go online to see the extras apart from a small still gallery and some cast bios. All the room on disk are taken up with four episodes from two other Showtime shows they are trying to promote. What I want to know, is Showtime going to be supporting those online extras for Dexter season five a year from now? How about two years or five? If they are going to offer extras and I pay for them, then I would like to have them on my disks so I can watch them whenever I want. Showtime is really throwing away customer good will and I know I am less inclned to watch or buy the dvds for the series featured on the Dexter disks because of Showtime's dictatoral approach. Oh, and one more 'extra', Showtime takes up disk space with a really lame contest ad too. There are absolutely no extras on this dvd set worth viewing, IMHO.That is why I subract two stars from the rating.

This is such a well written and well acted episode, and the way they have Dexter dealing with the death of _______ is brilliant. I don't believe I have ever felt as much sympathy for Dexter as I did in this episode. There is not even one wrong note here. I particularly like the humor in the one funny scene. And us Dexter fans get a chance to say goodbye to one of it's longtime, regular characters.So, it saddens me even more to say that most of the rest of the season is a bit of a letdown. Make that a BIG letdown. Man, what went wrong here? The writing took a big nosedive. I feel that the writers had no idea how to write for the character of Laguerta. Masuka is under-utilized here and when he does appear, he isn't nearly as lovable as he has been. Some of the dialogue is outright awkward. Some story lines get abandoned. Some story lines don't make much sense. There are a bunch of loose ends that never get tied up. Captain Matthews sole purpose in the few episodes he appears in seems to be to just scowl at everybody and criticize them. I used to kind of like this guy! And...as for Julia Stiles, I have nothing against her as an actress, but I felt like I could never completely sympathize with her character.Good points? This season still has more than it's share. I am still very much liking Dexter himself. And Jennifer Carpenter, to me, just keeps getting better and better as an actress. The season does find some kind of rhythm  and/or focus about 6 or 7 episodes in. There are some very cute moments with Harrison, as he takes his first steps and speaks his first words. I like the actress who plays the Irish nanny (she was also in 'The Commitments'). Peter Weller is creepy but fascinating as an ex-cop who Quinn gets to spy on Dexter. I mean, even with it's many flaws, my eyes were still glued to the TV screen while watching it. And while the season finale is nowhere near as exciting and suspenseful as Season 4's finale (at least in my humble opinion) and has one happy moment near the end that almost felt TOO happy and a bit fake to me, I still like some of what happens in it, particularly with Quinn.But...compared to Season 4 and the other seasons before it, I would have to say this is my least favorite season of Dexter. I am still recommending it of course, since I love this show, but proceed with caution....3 and a half stars.(It is November 2nd 2011 as I write this paragraph and after watching the first five episodes of Season 6 on Showtime, I now realize that the show lost it's edge during Season 5, along with tension, especially between the main characters.

I love Dexter, but I felt like there was some sloppiness and too many loose ends in the handling of Season 5. It's a season with an excellent premise, but mildly disappointing execution.**Possible Spoilers Below**A new partnership forms between Dexter and Lumen Pierce, a victim of Dexter's latest target. Lumen, who's played by Julia Stiles, is easily the dark horse of the season as far as I'm concerned. Her character is semi-unoriginal (Season 3's Miguel Prado shared a similar role), but she brings a freshness and emotional element to the show that Dexter Morgan lacks and Rita left behind. I thought the story of Lumen courting Dex to help track down the men who'd abused her and held her captive was magnificent. The chemistry between the two characters was far beyond anything I could have hoped for considering how invested I'd become in the Dexter/Rita dynamic. Additionally, there was something about this particular vigilante quest that feels different from any of Dexter's previous work, possibly because for the first time vengeance is being delivered by the victim. Either way, I was really drawn into Lumen and Dexter's story; it was dramatic, entertaining and charming all at the same time.Unfortunately from there, the season becomes a bit of a subtle mess. I have no problem looking past minor errors or drawing up my own conclusions as to why this or that could've fit the story, but a few of the subplots just didn't seem to come together in Season 5. The first thing I couldn't understand was why so little time was spent wrapping up Rita's story. After watching the Season 4 finale, my first thought was why the writers would kill off Trinity when they could've built the ultimate vengeance story revolving around the two serial killers in Season 5. I really thought Dexter hunting down Trinity to avenge Rita's death could've been the defining plot line in the series. Rather, the writers chose to focus on Rita for just one episode, only sporadically mentioning her from that point on. Astor's struggles in coping with her mother's death was just about the most invested the writers got in Rita from that point forward, and it felt unrealistic, even for the emotionally challenged Dexter, to write her off so quickly.The Santa Muerte killer story is nothing more than a stall, if you ask me. It's not bad at all, but essentially it has no tie-in whatsoever to the barrel girl murders. I'm not really sure what to make of it; you just figure each subplot is linked to the main story in some way, shape or form. Aside from a couple very minor connections, this really wasn't, and considering what a big part of the first seven or so episodes it was, I was surprised what an irrelevant, distant memory it became by season's end.Finally, Quinn's refusal to work with Agent Liddy after news of his suspicions reached Deb caused him to ignore very incriminating evidence against Dexter and Lumen. It was so blatant that when Dexter finds Liddy's pictures in Quinn's apartment, he mistakenly thinks Quinn is uncovering his secret life. The short of it is this: Quinn becomes so enamored with Deborah Morgan that he decides to drop his investigation of Dexter and ignore any and all dirt Liddy digs up in favor of preserving his relationship with Deb. Quinn was all over the place in Season 5, and I just found him to be completely out of character at times and his story impossible to believe.On the flip side, I found Lumen's reason for leaving Dexter a little easy, but definitely feasible. I'd like to see her return to the show at some point in the future if the writers find a good way to work her into a story.Though their characters were a little more unlikeable than usual, Maria and Angel deliver a very dramatic and tense subplot with their personal lives and professional lives clashing out in the open. Agent Liddy quickly develops a ""here comes trouble"" reputation, certainly a welcome addition to the show despite his malicious intentions. Lastly, I thought Trinity was too likeable for an antagonist (doesn't help that I'm a big fan of John Lithgow), so I was thrilled at how easily I could dislike Jordan Chase. Not only is that attributed to excellent character development, but Jonny Lee Miller deserves a lot of credit for his portrayal of the motivational speaker leading a double life.Of course, some things never change. Michael C. Hall brings Dexter to life, continuing to make the serial killer one of the most compelling characters on television. Michael's performance coupled with that of Julia Stiles really gave the plot a head of steam in Season 5. I thought in spite of Lumen's sad departure, the season finale was well crafted and well executed. It not only leaves you with a feeling of closure, but also leaves you wondering whether or not the status quo has changed.** **It has its problems along the way, but ultimately Season 5 was as good of a television drama as you'll come across. I gave it 4 stars; it's probably a little bit less than that, but I like giving shows the benefit of the doubt for sustained excellence. Dexter is absolutely still one of the best shows on television, and with Season 6 in production, we have more to look forward to.Grade: B+",4,Dexter Morgan: An American Anti-Hero,1304985600,"05 10,

So many intriguing sub-plots and characters circle our dark hero, but unlike other shows, in which sub-plot and characters exist merely as threads alongside the main storyline, every filament of plot in ""Dexter"" Season 5 leads directly back to the man and the story at center.  The writers of this show pull off an amazing hat-trick of suspense in this outstanding and somewhat unexpected Season 5.(Alert: Possible Spoiler Ahead)  If you're reading this, you probably know by now that Season 4 ended with the shocking (if textually convincing) murder of the character of Rita, Dexter's wife.  I wondered for a long time, waiting for Season 5 to arrive on DVD, how on earth this series would continue.  It seemed to me the show's creators had done just about all they could with the bizarre character of Dexter Morgan, and that there was little else to say following that bitterly ironic murder at the end of Season 4.  It amazes me that they not only found a way to move the story forward, but quickly developed an entirely fresh direction in the person of Lumen Pierce (Julia Stiles) which dominates Season 5.Michael C. Hall is fantastic as always.  Lauren Velez and David Zayas (i.e., LaGuerta & Batista), are not only terrific as always in this season, but they continue to find nuances of character that are absent elsewhere in television depictions of Latinos.  Much as the character of Deb is over-the-top potty-mouthed and temperamental, I never tire of watching Jennifer Carpenter's work; she manages to make me care about Deb precisely as one would about a sibling whose heart (and mouth) are sometimes bigger than her brain.  Best of all this season, though, is the guest star, Julia Stiles, who makes the unthinkable seem terrifyingly real.I loved the heck out of this season, and I can't imagine anyone who enjoys the series not being glued to every episode as well.",5,When it Comes to Suspense......Nobody Touches Dexter,1314230400,"08 25, 2011",2011,2065,"['have', 'say', 'TV/Cable', 'shows', 'watch', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'DVD/Blu-Ray', 'one', 'most', 'groan', 'end', 'episode', 'wishing', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'end', 'So', 'many', 'intriguing', 'sub-plots', 'characters', 'circle', 'dark', 'hero', 'other', 'shows', 'sub-plot', 'characters', 'exist', 'merely', 'threads', 'main', 'storyline', 'filament', 'plot', 'Dexter', 'Season', '5', 'directly', 'back', 'man', 'story', 'center', 'writers', 'show', 'off', 'amazing', 'hat-trick', 'suspense', 'outstanding', 'somewhat', 'unexpected', 'Season', '5', 'Alert', 'Possible', 'Spoiler', 'Ahead', ""'re"", 'reading', 'probably', 'know', 'now', 'Season', '4', 'ended', 'shocking', 'textually', 'convincing', 'murder', 'character', 'Rita', 'Dexter', 'wife', 'wondered', 'long', 'time', 'waiting', 'Season', '5', 'arrive', 'DVD', 'how', 'earth', 'series', 'would', 'continue', 'seemed', 'show', 'creators', 'had', 'done', 'just', 'could', 'bizarre', 'character', 'Dexter', 'Morgan', 'was', 'little', 'else', 'say', 'following', 'bitterly', 'ironic', 'murder', 'end', 'Season', '4', 'not', 'only', 'found', 'way', 'move', 'story', 'forward', 'quickly', 'developed', 'entirely', 'fresh', 'direction', 'person', 'Lumen', 'Pierce', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Season', '5.Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'fantastic', 'always', 'Lauren', 'Velez', 'David', 'Zayas', 'i.e.', 'LaGuerta', 'Batista', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'terrific', 'always', 'season', 'continue', 'find', 'nuances', 'character', 'are', 'absent', 'elsewhere', 'television', 'depictions', 'Latinos', 'Much', 'character', 'Deb', 'over-the-top', 'potty-mouthed', 'temperamental', 'never', 'tire', 'watching', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'work', 'make', 'care', 'Deb', 'precisely', 'one', 'would', 'sibling', 'heart', 'mouth', 'are', 'sometimes', 'bigger', 'brain', 'Best', 'season', 'though', 'guest', 'star', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'who', 'unthinkable', 'seem', 'terrifyingly', 'real.I', 'loved', 'heck', 'season', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'who', 'series', 'not', 'being', 'glued', 'episode', 'well']",N/A

Lumen indicates that she's willing to take out the scum who attacked her and Dexter tries to save her.END OF SPOILERS:One of the highlights of season five is Peter Weller as a disgraced naracotics cop being used by Quinn to find dirt on Dexter. Weller makes up for the absence of John Lithgow--he's a terrific actor who hasn't been given the roles he really deserves lately (although he was brilliant in his recent appearance on ""Fringe""), he shines in this season of ""Dexter"".The fifth season of ""Dexter"" looks pretty good on DVD although the image is occasionally a bit soft part of that is the look of the show. Detail is quite good for most of the show and colors positively pop nicely capturing the sunny, bright look of Miami.Audios is terrific with a strong 5.1 mix although keep in mind that dialogue is the primary focus on many of the episodes.The fifth season of ""Dexter"" starts with a lot of potential but I felt that the season finale petered out and disappointed a bit compared to season four. Still, season five is pretty strong over all.The special features as with all previous episodes of ""Dexter"" aren't all that great but for most fans it's about the show itself.We get interviews with the primary cast members for season five and a featurette on Julia Stiles fifth season appearance. I do find it disappointing that Showtime STILL doesn't include ANY commentary tracks on the episodes included.We also get two episodes of ""The Borgias"" as a cross promotional tie-in for that Showtime series. The Blu-ray offers BD-Live access to episodes of Showtime series as well.The DVD however uses ""E-Bridge"" Technology for the first two episodes of ""Californication"". If you don't care for this series (I'm not a fan)then this won't be much of a special feature for you.Again, the fifth season of ""Dexter"" is relatively strong although it doesn't quite measure up to the conclusion of season five.Recommended.",4,Dexter must try and contain a woman bend on revenge in the fifth season of the show.,1313712000,"08 19, 2011",2011,2209,"['fifth', 'season', 'Dexter', 'sharp', 'unexpected', 'turn.SPOILERS', 'FOLLOW', 'Dexter', 'tries', 'recover', 'Rita', 'murder', 'taking', 'out', 'more', 'serial', 'killing', 'scum', 'process', 'someone', 'unexpectantly-Lumen', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'next', 'victim', 'Boyd', 'killer', 'Dexter', 'just', 'offed', 'Lumen', 'willing', 'take', 'out', 'scum', 'who', 'attacked', 'Dexter', 'tries', 'save', 'her.END', 'SPOILERS', 'One', 'highlights', 'season', 'five', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'disgraced', 'naracotics', 'cop', 'being', 'used', 'Quinn', 'find', 'dirt', 'Dexter', 'Weller', 'up', 'absence', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'terrific', 'actor', 'who', ""n't"", 'been', 'given', 'roles', 'really', 'lately', 'was', 'brilliant', 'recent', 'appearance', 'Fringe', 'season', 'Dexter', '.The', 'fifth', 'season', 'Dexter', 'pretty', 'good', 'DVD', 'image', 'occasionally', 'bit', 'soft', 'part', 'look', 'show', 'Detail', 'quite', 'good', 'most', 'show', 'colors', 'positively', 'pop', 'nicely', 'capturing', 'sunny', 'bright', 'look', 'Miami.Audios', 'terrific', 'strong', '5.1', 'mix', 'keep', 'mind', 'dialogue', 'primary', 'focus', 'many', 'episodes.The', 'fifth', 'season', 'Dexter', 'lot', 'potential', 'felt', 'season', 'finale', 'petered', 'out', 'disappointed', 'bit', 'compared', 'season', 'four', 'Still', 'season', 'five', 'pretty', 'strong', 'all.The', 'special', 'features', 'previous', 'episodes', 'Dexter', 'are', ""n't"", 'all', 'great', 'most', 'fans', 'show', 'itself.We', 'get', 'interviews', 'primary', 'cast', 'members', 'season', 'five', 'featurette', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'season', 'appearance', 'do', 'find', 'disappointing', 'Showtime', 'STILL', ""n't"", 'include', 'ANY', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'episodes', 'included.We', 'also', 'get', 'two', 'episodes', 'Borgias', 'cross', 'promotional', 'tie-in', 'Showtime', 'series', 'Blu-ray', 'offers', 'BD-Live', 'access', 'episodes', 'Showtime', 'series', 'well.The', 'DVD', 'however', 'E-Bridge', 'Technology', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'Californication', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'series', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'special', 'feature', 'you.Again', 'fifth', 'season', 'Dexter', 'relatively', 'strong', ""n't"", 'quite', 'measure', 'up', 'conclusion', 'season', 'five.Recommended']",N/A
1352802,A25PSIGEGEL7DE,B003L77GRO,William A. Levinson,"[0, 0]","The story and the acting are outstanding enough to earn five stars. A realistic story about a serial killer who channels his ""dark passenger"" for constructive and even heroic purposes is more than enough to hold anybody's interest. They also have first-rate actors (e.g. John Lithgow as the Trinity killer, and Edward James Olmos in Season 6).I must, however, demote it two steps because of Showtime's disrespect for customers. The DVD locks out your player's control, and will not allow you to stop, switch to disc menu, or fast forward through Showtime's advertising. If I wanted to watch advertising, I would watch commercial television and not pay for a DVD.Is a two step demotion really in order? As a quality professional, I know that a problem that a customer remembers can absolutely ruin the customer's perception of an otherwise top-rate product--sort of like finding a dead insect in a gourmet meal at a five-star restaurant. This is the situation here.My solution is simply to put the DVD into the player several minutes before I plan to watch it. [...] adds that pressing Stop, Stop, and Play (or ""Stop"" three times followed by Play) will circumvent the problem, but maybe not for all DVD players. What is really needed is a DVD player that will simply ignore the disk's programming to deal with this issue.",3,DVDs illustrate Showtime's disrespect for customers,1386720000,"12 11, 2013",2013,1320,"['story', 'acting', 'are', 'outstanding', 'enough', 'earn', 'five', 'stars', 'A', 'realistic', 'story', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'dark', 'passenger', 'constructive', 'even', 'heroic', 'purposes', 'more', 'enough', 'hold', 'anybody', 'interest', 'also', 'have', 'first-rate', 'actors', 'e.g', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Trinity', 'killer', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'Season', '6', '.I', 'must', 'however', 'demote', 'two', 'steps', 'Showtime', 'disrespect', 'customers', 'DVD', 'out', 'player', 'control', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'stop', 'switch', 'disc', 'menu', 'fast', 'forward', 'Showtime', 'advertising', 'wanted', 'watch', 'advertising', 'would', 'watch', 'commercial', 'television', 'not', 'pay', 'DVD.Is', 'two', 'step', 'demotion', 'really', 'order', 'quality', 'professional', 'know', 'problem', 'customer', 'remembers', 'can', 'absolutely', 'ruin', 'customer', 'perception', 'otherwise', 'top-rate', 'product', 'sort', 'finding', 'dead', 'insect', 'gourmet', 'meal', 'five-star', 'restaurant', 'situation', 'here.My', 'solution', 'simply', 'put', 'DVD', 'player', 'several', 'minutes', 'plan', 'watch', 'pressing', 'Stop', 'Stop', 'Play', 'Stop', 'three', 'times', 'followed', 'Play', 'will', 'circumvent', 'problem', 'maybe', 'not', 'DVD', 'players', 'What', 'really', 'needed', 'DVD', 'player', 'will', 'simply', 'ignore', 'disk', 'programming', 'deal', 'issue']",N/A
1352803,A1K7X23UDT0R7V,B003L77GRO,Winston D. Jen,"[0, 0]","Following Season 4's mind-shattering denouement (in which Dexter learns to prioritise other issues beyond his need to kill and sate his Dark Passenger), his life has been shredded by the death throes of the Trinity Killer. The ripple effect of his triple life as a father, vigilante and forensic blood spatter analyst come back to haunt him in a singular moment of revelation and horror.As one who has followed the first four seasons would expect, the initial episode focuses on Dexter and his internal struggle and debate on how and whether to move forward. Although this would leave less time to focus on the antagonists of these twelve episodes, the focus is on Dexter and a monumentally instrumental (though temporary) addition to Dexter's life and the series as a whole. The pace is breakneck throughout, and as always, the viewer is invited to put themselves inside Dexter's emotionless head once again.The rest of the cast (Debra, Batista, Quinn and LaGuerta) continue to develop, and though the season only takes a month or so, we see the stirrings of aftershocks that will be explored further in season six and beyond. A must-have for all Dexter fans. Debra finally breaks out of her neat and shell of rules and regulations. Her emotions finally shove her reason and detective training out of the driver's seat, and she is forced to confront a situation with many shades of gray.",5,Maintains and in some cases Surpasses its own High Standards,1358467200,"01 18, 2013",2013,1388,"['Following', 'Season', '4', 'mind-shattering', 'denouement', 'Dexter', 'prioritise', 'other', 'issues', 'need', 'kill', 'sate', 'Dark', 'Passenger', 'life', 'been', 'shredded', 'death', 'throes', 'Trinity', 'Killer', 'ripple', 'effect', 'triple', 'life', 'father', 'vigilante', 'forensic', 'blood', 'spatter', 'analyst', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'singular', 'moment', 'revelation', 'horror.As', 'one', 'who', 'followed', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'would', 'expect', 'initial', 'episode', 'Dexter', 'internal', 'struggle', 'debate', 'how', 'move', 'forward', 'would', 'leave', 'less', 'time', 'focus', 'antagonists', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'focus', 'Dexter', 'monumentally', 'instrumental', 'temporary', 'addition', 'Dexter', 'life', 'series', 'whole', 'pace', 'breakneck', 'always', 'viewer', 'invited', 'put', 'Dexter', 'emotionless', 'head', 'once', 'again.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'Debra', 'Batista', 'Quinn', 'LaGuerta', 'continue', 'develop', 'season', 'only', 'month', 'so', 'see', 'stirrings', 'aftershocks', 'will', 'be', 'explored', 'further', 'season', 'six', 'must-have', 'Dexter', 'fans', 'Debra', 'finally', 'neat', 'shell', 'rules', 'regulations', 'emotions', 'finally', 'shove', 'reason', 'detective', 'training', 'driver', 'seat', 'forced', 'confront', 'situation', 'many', 'shades', 'gray']",N/A
