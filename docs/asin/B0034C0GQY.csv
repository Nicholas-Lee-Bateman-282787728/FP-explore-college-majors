Everything was natural and realistic.The quality of the filming was equally good.  Nothing at all in the amateur way.This movie is NOT your typical ""goodie-two-shoes"" Christian movie.

However, what I got was a good movie that had a clear message of redemption, forgiveness, and, in the end, sacrifice.  Yes, the ending was sad, but, in my opinion, quite powerful.  From where the father of the man who extended forgiveness to Joe Rowley's character all the way to when Joe's character was killed by the vindictive, angry young man.The short of it is that I liked this movie.  A lot.  Don't expect Bogie and Bacall.  Don't expect anything of the Hollywood ilk.  Just expect a movie with a message.  That there is hope and forgiveness.",4,It's not Hollywood.

As they face new challenges, they are pushed to find the true source of their reason for living.  There is some good drama and suspense in this movie.  The actors do a superb job.
