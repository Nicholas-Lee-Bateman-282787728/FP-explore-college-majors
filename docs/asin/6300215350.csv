Now it takes a lot to make my aunt really laugh at a movie, so I went over to her house and watched.  I LOVED IT!!!  The dialogue is reminiscent of the screwball comedies of the 30's and the Reggae musical score is perfect for the Carribbean setting.  All the characters are excellently done and the performances a treat to watch. The plot is absurd enough to be a wonderful parody of reality.The story stars Michael Caine as the governor of this impoverished island and his dry delivery is so low key that you want to see him in every scene, and he usually is.As Governor of Cascara, a small and very poor British protectorate in the Caribbean, he despairs of ever getting a better posting due to his unfortunate marriage to a South American girl of dubious background, played beautifully by Brenda Vaccaro.  She had been a dancer and the Governor proposed while apparently under the influence.The island, unlike most Caribbean islands, has no beach, only a rocky shoreline so no chance of tourism in a area of the world just awash with tourists and their dollars.  Also, the only crop on the island seems to be a form of hemp, otherwise known as marijuana.  The Governor's crop is particularly good.There is a fly in the ointment, of course, and it is the ""Singing Rebel"", played wickedly by Billy Connolly.  He wants to free the down trodden people of Cascara, a la Che Guevara.  His main problem is ALL the people are downtrodden and really don't pay any attention to him but he keeps lurking in the shrubbery and trying to get arrested.All runs along as ineptly as possible until the British government decides that this is a drain on their economy and they are going to give Cascara its freedom.  This is quite a surprise for the Governor, as he has written innumerable letters asking for aid for his island and has less than no response.  Britain sends a representative to inform the people and the Governor of their decision.  This is when things go from bad, but funny, to awful, but awfully funny!I highly recommend it.  I immediately bought it and have repeatedly watched this gem.  It never gets old!  Buy it and enjoy!!!",5,"Funniest ""musical"" (?) comedy!",1093651200,"08 28, 2004",2004,2248,"['never', 'heard', 'flick', 'aunt', 'told', 'had', 'taped', 'TV', 'thought', 'was', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'Now', 'lot', 'make', 'aunt', 'really', 'movie', 'went', 'house', 'watched', 'LOVED', 'IT', 'dialogue', 'reminiscent', 'screwball', 'comedies', '30', 'Reggae', 'musical', 'score', 'perfect', 'Carribbean', 'setting', 'characters', 'are', 'excellently', 'done', 'performances', 'treat', 'watch', 'plot', 'absurd', 'enough', 'be', 'wonderful', 'parody', 'reality.The', 'story', 'stars', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'governor', 'impoverished', 'island', 'dry', 'delivery', 'so', 'low', 'key', 'want', 'see', 'scene', 'usually', 'is.As', 'Governor', 'Cascara', 'small', 'very', 'poor', 'British', 'protectorate', 'Caribbean', 'ever', 'getting', 'better', 'posting', 'due', 'unfortunate', 'marriage', 'South', 'American', 'girl', 'dubious', 'background', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Brenda', 'Vaccaro', 'had', 'been', 'dancer', 'Governor', 'proposed', 'apparently', 'influence.The', 'island', 'most', 'Caribbean', 'islands', 'beach', 'only', 'rocky', 'shoreline', 'chance', 'tourism', 'area', 'world', 'just', 'awash', 'tourists', 'dollars', 'Also', 'only', 'crop', 'island', 'be', 'form', 'hemp', 'otherwise', 'known', 'marijuana', 'Governor', 'crop', 'particularly', 'good.There', 'fly', 'ointment', 'course', 'Singing', 'Rebel', 'played', 'wickedly', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'free', 'down', 'trodden', 'people', 'Cascara', 'la', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'main', 'problem', 'people', 'are', 'downtrodden', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'lurking', 'shrubbery', 'trying', 'get', 'arrested.All', 'runs', 'as', 'ineptly', 'possible', 'British', 'government', 'drain', 'economy', 'are', 'going', 'give', 'Cascara', 'freedom', 'quite', 'surprise', 'Governor', 'written', 'innumerable', 'letters', 'asking', 'aid', 'island', 'less', 'response', 'Britain', 'representative', 'inform', 'people', 'Governor', 'decision', 'when', 'things', 'go', 'bad', 'funny', 'awful', 'awfully', 'funny', 'highly', 'recommend', 'immediately', 'bought', 'have', 'repeatedly', 'watched', 'gem', 'never', 'old', 'Buy', 'enjoy']",Water VHS

Farmbrough ""Dave Farmbrough""","[21, 21]","Despite being poorly received on its release, Water isn't just another of those films Michael Caine did for the money. There's a strong script from Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais, who show an informed knowledge of the confusion arising from the effects of colonialism and post-colonial on West Indian islands, spoofing both the attitudes of the locals and the representatives of Her Majesty's Government.Caine is splendid as the 'gone native' consul and Billy Connolly excels in an early film role as a half-English half-Cascaran islander, whose sympathies are definitely with the Cascarans. There are also some wonderful musical numbers, featuring George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Jon Lord, Eric Clapton, and Connolly himself, proving himself to be a superb singer as well as a fine actor.
