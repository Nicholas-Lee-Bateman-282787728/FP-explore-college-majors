Jodi is a victim of abuse who has created a world for herself away from the pains of everyday life. Her friendship with the new girl in town is the basis of this story. This is an example of an excellent character study and a delightful adventure for all ages.,5,Gold Diggers-an intriguing adventure for all,1267574400,"03 3, 2010",2010,390,"['spirit', 'tradition', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'quest', 'lost', 'gold', 'story', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'Jodi', 'victim', 'abuse', 'who', 'created', 'world', 'away', 'pains', 'everyday', 'life', 'friendship', 'new', 'girl', 'town', 'basis', 'story', 'example', 'excellent', 'character', 'study', 'delightful', 'adventure', 'ages']",N/A
1320325,A2S29EES9TA9ZM,B0033PSH68,hredzak,"[1, 1]","When a young teen (Beth- Christina Ricci) abandons city life in LA with her widowed mom in the summer of 1980 for a country town in the Pacific Northwest, she discovers the great outdoors and finds a very unusual best friend.Jody comes from a dysfunctional home and lives with her drunken, divorced mom and abusive boyfriend. She (Anna Chlumsky) is a careless tomboy with a penchant for lying and thievery and is ostracized by her peers who suspect she's on a clear road to either a mental institution or prison. In the spirit of Huck Finn, Jody rejects ""civilized"" life and all the senseless cruelty its given her... she's become a free-spirit who prefers the hidden depths of nature and Bear Mountain as her proper home. And one day she aims to find the gold hidden in Bear Mountain by the legendary Molly Morgan (her mountain woman idol).I laughed the first time Beth spots Jody. Jodie totally looks like a cute boy. I appreciated that the story was more about friendship than finding the gold. It's an honest and emotional friendship that is made deep by loyalty and acceptance... and there are no friendships like the ones you find around this age. It has an excellent message. These two bond over chance meetings, a love for Winnie the Pooh, and on some level, probably because of the absent father thing. I don't think there is a stronger healing force than the bonds we have with other females, especially as a troubled teen.This is a fun little pre/early teen adventure where nature is easily a secondary character and two females get to be the adventurers that boys are typically cast in. I found it very nostalgic. If you grew up with your own bit of nature you'd spend all day exploring while playing imaginary games with your friends, this will definitely bring you back. Loved the feel good song at the beginning and end.Surprisingly, I'd never seen this one before (1995 release). But I'd put it on my list of movies to watch when a friend I know said she watched this one over and over as a confused youth and now she knows why, lol. Now I know why, lol.

The movie itself, I'd rate higher, but the transfer to dvd brings the rating WAY down.In other words, buying it as a DVD-R transfer is at your own risk. I ended up having to return this once and get a 2nd copy. The first one was badly burned and had several sections throughout the movie that jumped, skipped several seconds and froze making it unwatchable. I was able to get a replacement copy which just has one jump towards the end that I'll end up keeping as I have no idea if a good copy exists.Also, they put no effort in this transfer at all.  For instance, the dvd has no menu. It automatically starts and it replays after the movie is over in an unending loop.  Also, there is a jump in the sound right in the first seconds of the opening that was there when the movie played years ago that is still there.So in otherwards, if you've waited years to see this on DVD, you might want to give it a shot, but be prepared to get multiple copies before you get a workable one. Kind of a sad end for a good movie.
