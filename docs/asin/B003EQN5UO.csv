Laws ""DreamRycher""","[0, 0]","I've been a big fan of Volumes 1-7 of Red vs. Blue and very much looked forward to watching this volume . . . and I was NOT disappointed! I'm not sure, but I think they greatly improved the action animation with this series, it seemed like during the fight scenes that there was a LOT more unique animation done just for this.  It was definitely not things you would see in the Halo game itself!  And the hilarious dialogue and funny situations that all the characters get into continue as well.  I think this is probably my second favorite volume, following closely the first volume.  Overall, an awesome series and I can't wait to wait to watch Volume 9!!",5,Yet another great volume of Red vs. Blue!!,1391126400,"01 31, 2014",2014,657,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Volumes', '1-7', 'Red', 'vs.', 'Blue', 'very', 'much', 'looked', 'forward', 'watching', 'volume', 'was', 'NOT', 'disappointed', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'think', 'greatly', 'improved', 'action', 'animation', 'series', 'seemed', 'fight', 'scenes', 'was', 'LOT', 'more', 'unique', 'animation', 'done', 'just', 'was', 'definitely', 'not', 'things', 'would', 'see', 'Halo', 'game', 'hilarious', 'dialogue', 'funny', 'situations', 'characters', 'get', 'continue', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'probably', 'second', 'favorite', 'volume', 'following', 'closely', 'first', 'volume', 'Overall', 'awesome', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'wait', 'watch', 'Volume', '9']",Red vs. Blue Season 8: Revelation

1338096,AS8D1GSXY637U,B003EQN5UO,Stephen H. Poor,"[4, 4]","In Season 8, we continue the story of ""Reconstruction.""  Some old characters return (including Doc), and we finally discover the fate of Tex.  Just as in the preceding two seasons, the story is more plot-driven, and less an excuse to move the characters from one ridiculous situation to another.  The problem is, the plot still doesn't make much sense.  We could forgive that in the days when this was almost purely a comedy, but when the writers ventured into more dramatic territory, they should have begun filling all those holes in the plot.The characters are still fun though, and the show is as full of laughs as ever.  In some of these episodes, Sarge really steals the show, and he has some of his best lines and most interesting growth as a character in this season.  Church also has some wonderful moments in the finale, and this was the season that I realized (maybe I should have before) that Church and Caboose really ARE best friends, no matter how much the former denies it.The biggest change in this season is the CG.  Well I guess it's really ALL computer-generated, but this season they added CG elements that weren't from the game.  Instead of pure machinima, they brought an animator onboard to create fight sequences that could never have been done with the HALO engine.  They are stunning, but they never detract from the rest of the show.  That is, the writers never fall into the trap of just letting the amimation be the star of the show.  They have done it just right.",4,A new direction for RVB,1304985600,"05 10, 2011",2011,1494,"['Season', '8', 'continue', 'story', 'Reconstruction', 'old', 'characters', 'return', 'including', 'Doc', 'finally', 'discover', 'fate', 'Tex', 'Just', 'preceding', 'two', 'seasons', 'story', 'more', 'plot-driven', 'less', 'excuse', 'move', 'characters', 'one', 'ridiculous', 'situation', 'problem', 'plot', 'still', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'could', 'forgive', 'days', 'when', 'was', 'almost', 'purely', 'comedy', 'when', 'writers', 'ventured', 'more', 'dramatic', 'territory', 'should', 'have', 'begun', 'filling', 'holes', 'plot.The', 'characters', 'are', 'still', 'fun', 'show', 'full', 'laughs', 'ever', 'episodes', 'Sarge', 'really', 'show', 'best', 'lines', 'most', 'interesting', 'growth', 'character', 'season', 'Church', 'also', 'wonderful', 'moments', 'finale', 'was', 'season', 'realized', 'maybe', 'should', 'have', 'Church', 'Caboose', 'really', 'ARE', 'best', 'friends', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'former', 'denies', 'it.The', 'biggest', 'change', 'season', 'CG', 'Well', 'guess', 'really', 'computer-generated', 'season', 'added', 'CG', 'elements', 'were', ""n't"", 'game', 'Instead', 'pure', 'machinima', 'brought', 'animator', 'onboard', 'create', 'fight', 'sequences', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'HALO', 'engine', 'are', 'stunning', 'never', 'detract', 'rest', 'show', 'writers', 'never', 'fall', 'trap', 'just', 'letting', 'amimation', 'be', 'star', 'show', 'have', 'done', 'just', 'right']",Red vs. Blue Season 8: Revelation
