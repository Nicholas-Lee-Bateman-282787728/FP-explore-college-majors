Pat refuses Steve Leach's offer to ride with them. [Headstrong?] The Hennessey's are out there, they harass McKay as a ""welcome"". We learn about the rivalry between these two ranching outfits. Major Terrill sets out on a punitive expedition against the Hennesseys (the smaller outfit); their water tank is drilled to spill their scarce water. Terrill's outfit rides into town to find and punish the Hennessey boys. The townsmen do nothing, they are terrorized by the Terrill gang.There is a party in the big Terrill house. [Its interior looks like it belongs in the state capital, not a dusty rural town.] Mr. Rufus Hennessey shows up to warn Major Terrill against any more attacks. Major Terrill does not accept the challenge [in public]. Rufus has a problem with his son Buck, but is Buck smarter after all? If Buck can marry Julie Maragon then the Big Muddy ranch and its water supply will give the Hennessey's the power in the valley. Jim McKay goes for a ride in the country; he has a compass and a map to navigate. Steve Leach is interested in Pat Terrill, but she has made her choice. McKay visits the Maragon ranch, and cleverly convinces the heiress to sell it to him. This will make his a power in the county. Back at the ranch he visits Leach to settle their differences. [This is all done with long camera shots that hide their stunt doubles.]The crisis comes when Terrill's men attack the Hennessey's herd of cattle to keep them away from the water at the Maragon ranch. This means a range war, shooting begins when talking fails. [War is the continuation of diplomacy.] The Hennessey's are outnumbered and retreat. McKay and Pat break up over a misunderstanding. [There are other psychological conflicts in this drama.] Rufus has a plan to get the Big Muddy ranch, but it fails. Then he goes to his back-up plan - a final showdown with Major Terrill and his outfit. [Could those experienced riders have missed seeing the trap?]This story has a surprise at the end. Did you find it believable? The needlessly ambiguous ending may not have been successful with the public. This film is also too slow-paced for me, it takes up time. This story recalls the many wars of big ranchers against small ranchers in the late 19th century. Like wars in general, it is a fight over property, to get it or to keep it. Will the good guys win?

152605,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,079284517X,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[8, 8]","This is a sprawling, glorious saga that will be appreciated by people who don't even like the Western genre. With fabulous cinematography, an excellent script, and two of my favorite actors, it's a film I never tire of watching.Gregory Peck is the sea captain with principles who goes west to meet his future bride, only to find feuds and fighting, and some lawless varmints who need his ""non violent"" ways of resolving territorial issues. He is terrific as James McKay, who is sort of an Atticus Finch in boots, and looks mighty fine as well.Charlton Heston has the smaller part as Leech, a foreman who is seething with jealousy and obeys the orders of his unscrupulous boss (rancher Terrill, played with subtle menace by Charles Bickford) as he yearns for his daughter. Heston is brilliant as this rather complex character, and would a year later star in director William Wyler's next epic, ""Ben Hur"", which is perhaps my all-time most viewed and enjoyed film.Both female leads are wonderful, and are portrayed with enormous strength; Jean Simmons, with her luminous eyes is the schoolteacher, and Carroll Baker is the tough daughter of rancher Bickford,  and is too much like her daddy to make a suitable bride for Peck.Among the many strong performances in the supporting parts are Burl Ives, and received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his gnarly old Rufus, Chuck Connors is his bad to the bone son, and Alfonso Bedoya, is a delight as Ramon, who along with a horse named ""Old Thunder"", provides some of the humor in the film.The score by Jerome Moross is lovely (and received an Oscar nomination) and the cinematography by Franz Planner spectacular. The film was shot in the San Joaquin and Stanislaus Counties as well as Last Chance Canyon in California, and it is breathtakingly beautiful.If you like a good screen fight like I do, this has a great one, ""mano a mano"" between Peck and Heston; it initially has no music, just the pounding of the fists and the men gasping for breath, and is very effective.Romance, drama, and lots of action make this a film that appeals to many, and is suitable for the whole family.

(Some critics consider it &#34;overblown&#34; but I think that misses the point.)  The recurring dual theme is (1) the attempts by Jim McKay (Peck) to avoid needless conflicts and needless escalation of existing conflicts and (2) the reactions of various characters to these attempts and what these reactions reveal about their moral fiber, notably the shallowness of McKay's fiance (Baker) and the unyielding arrogance of his prospective father-in-law (Bickford).

152612,A1PASRZ81DY9C,079284517X,Austin Somlo,"[0, 1]","Viewed: 5/14Rate: 105/14: Is The Big Country the Citizen Kane of Western films? I think so. The Searchers is absolutely the most overrated movie, Western or not, I've ever seen, and I don't know how that one gets so praised highly. It's just a stupid Cowboy-Indian movie with tons of racist overtones. Nevertheless, The Big Country seems to hit a lot of points very well in a deep, allegorical way that the critics feel in The Searchers. It is also the opposite of everything Western, or any genre for that matter, films usually are. That's why The Big Country is a highly unusual movie. Of all the actors and actresses in The Big Country, Gregory Peck does it for me. I am not a fan of his work, but I admit, he is very, very good in the movie, who really hit the right tones in a lot of situations. He makes the film fun to watch because his character is interesting. If not for him, I seriously doubt The Big Country becomes the film it is. Charlton Heston, in an ironical twist, plays Messala in the movie for the obvious reasons, and he is very good. I never liked Carroll Baker's character, Patricia Terrill, from the get go because there was something in her that didn't seem to be compatible with Peck's character. Over time, it got more and more pronounced. Most of the time, I was hoping that he would come to his senses and dump her, so the film didn't disappoint me one bit. Jean Simmons is a nice surprise if one can see how her character slowly becomes the focal point of the story. Burl Ives and Charles Bickford are great and masterful, but an Oscar win for Burl Ives? I don't think so. Chuck Connors is a bit too much for me, but he is okay enough. Alfonso Bedoya, who played Ramon, is a pleasant equalizer. Surely, The Big Country has more bad people than good people; in fact, only three are good people compared to scores of them which made the film a tough watch, but William Wyler, the master director, navigates me through with reassurance. In the end, I must say that I am overall impressed with it although the length of the film did test me at times. All in all, The Big Country is a magnificent Western film that resembles Giant very well but with much deeper meanings. Here is a nice trivia from imdb.com: ""Then US President Dwight D. Eisenhower gave the movie four consecutive showings at the White House and called it `simply the best film ever made.

The film's sheer size ultimately defeats director Wyler's goal, but what emerges is still a rip-roaring drama, with terrific performances by Oscar-winner Burl Ives, Chuck Connors, Charlton Heston, and Charles Bickford.Eastern ship captain James McKay (Peck) arrives in a GIANT-like Western town to marry Patricia Terrill (Carroll Baker), whose father (Bickford) is a major landowner in the area. He immediately draws the ire of top hand Steve Leech (Heston) when he refuses to discard an Eastern-style hat (Leech obviously is Patricia's jilted lover, as well, setting the stage for an eventual physical confrontation between the two men). Patricia is beautiful, but shallow and temperamental, unlike her more mature, sensitive friend, schoolteacher Julie Maragon (Jean Simmons), and one wonders what McKay saw in her to make him propose!En route to the Terrill ranch, McKay and Patricia are intercepted by a wild, acrobatic gang of cowboys, led by Buck Hannassey (Connors), son of the Terrill's mortal enemy and biggest rival, Rufus Hannassey (Ives). After a long chase/trick riding demonstration (punctuated by one of the film's many great musical themes, by composer Jerome Moross), Patricia's venomous reaction to Buck's escapades leads to McKay's being manhandled, roped, and roughed up, a bit. While McKay is forgiving, Col. Terrill (Bickford) uses the incident to invade the Hannassey ranch in force, and then ride into town, pistol-whipping Hannassey men (Buck hides to protect himself).Thus begins McKay's education of 'The Way of the West', and his rebellion against it's traditions. He refuses to ride a wild old mustang in front of all the ranch hands and humiliate himself (the 'initiation' of the ranch), later breaking the stallion on his own. He navigates the huge Terrill estate with a compass, then refuses to publicly fight the disbelieving Leech, who'd led a search party to find him (McKay later takes Leech on, before dawn, when there would be no audience, then questions what purpose the fistfight served...an act that forces Leech to consider how trivial and out-of-kilter his way of life is). He refuses to endorse the Terrill/Hannassey feud, but buys the 'Big Muddy', a water-rich property, owned by Julie, which both sides covet, offering the water to everyone (which costs him Patricia's hand).McKay's intellect and compassion reveals just how petty and bigoted both Col. Terrill and Rufus Hannassey are, but like two aging bulls, the pair inevitably march towards a deadly showdown by the film's climax, as futile and meaningless as McKay and Leech's earlier brawl. A 'Blood Feud' must be settled in blood, even when common sense proves it ridiculous.Epic in scope, with the Wyler 'style' clearly evident in pacing and characterization, THE BIG COUNTRY may have misfired as an 'Anti-Western', but is still an entertaining, engaging production, and certainly deserves a place in any film fan's collection.",4,"William Wyler's 'Anti-Western' Long, but Rewarding...",1090972800,"07 28, 2004",2004,3188,"['BIG', 'COUNTRY', 'rocky', 'collaboration', 'co-producers', 'William', 'Wyler', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'big', 'expensive', 'deconstruction', ""'classic"", 'western', 'genre', 'values', 'placing', 'Eastern', 'intellectual', 'Peck', 'midst', 'questioning', 'validity', 'film', 'sheer', 'size', 'ultimately', 'director', 'Wyler', 'goal', 'what', 'still', 'rip-roaring', 'drama', 'terrific', 'performances', 'Oscar-winner', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Charles', 'Bickford.Eastern', 'ship', 'captain', 'James', 'McKay', 'Peck', 'GIANT-like', 'Western', 'town', 'marry', 'Patricia', 'Terrill', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'father', 'Bickford', 'major', 'landowner', 'area', 'immediately', 'ire', 'top', 'hand', 'Steve', 'Leech', 'Heston', 'when', 'discard', 'Eastern-style', 'hat', 'Leech', 'obviously', 'Patricia', 'jilted', 'lover', 'as', 'well', 'setting', 'stage', 'eventual', 'physical', 'confrontation', 'two', 'men', 'Patricia', 'beautiful', 'shallow', 'temperamental', 'more', 'mature', 'sensitive', 'friend', 'schoolteacher', 'Julie', 'Maragon', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'one', 'wonders', 'what', 'McKay', 'saw', 'make', 'propose', 'En', 'route', 'Terrill', 'ranch', 'McKay', 'Patricia', 'are', 'intercepted', 'wild', 'acrobatic', 'gang', 'cowboys', 'led', 'Buck', 'Hannassey', 'Connors', 'son', 'Terrill', 'mortal', 'enemy', 'biggest', 'rival', 'Rufus', 'Hannassey', 'Ives', 'long', 'chase/trick', 'riding', 'demonstration', 'punctuated', 'one', 'film', 'many', 'great', 'musical', 'themes', 'composer', 'Jerome', 'Moross', 'Patricia', 'venomous', 'reaction', 'Buck', 'escapades', 'McKay', 'being', 'manhandled', 'roped', 'roughed', 'up', 'bit', 'McKay', 'forgiving', 'Col.', 'Terrill', 'Bickford', 'incident', 'invade', 'Hannassey', 'ranch', 'force', 'then', 'ride', 'town', 'pistol-whipping', 'Hannassey', 'men', 'Buck', 'protect', '.Thus', 'McKay', 'education', ""'The"", 'Way', 'West', 'rebellion', 'traditions', 'ride', 'wild', 'old', 'mustang', 'front', 'ranch', 'hands', 'humiliate', ""'initiation"", 'ranch', 'later', 'breaking', 'stallion', 'own', 'huge', 'Terrill', 'estate', 'compass', 'then', 'publicly', 'fight', 'disbelieving', 'Leech', 'who', ""'d"", 'led', 'search', 'party', 'find', 'McKay', 'later', 'Leech', 'dawn', 'when', 'would', 'be', 'audience', 'then', 'questions', 'what', 'purpose', 'fistfight', 'served', 'act', 'Leech', 'consider', 'how', 'trivial', 'out-of-kilter', 'way', 'life', 'endorse', 'Terrill/Hannassey', 'feud', ""'Big"", 'Muddy', 'water-rich', 'property', 'owned', 'Julie', 'sides', 'covet', 'offering', 'water', 'everyone', 'Patricia', 'hand', '.McKay', 'intellect', 'compassion', 'reveals', 'just', 'how', 'petty', 'bigoted', 'Col.', 'Terrill', 'Rufus', 'Hannassey', 'are', 'two', 'aging', 'bulls', 'pair', 'inevitably', 'march', 'towards', 'deadly', 'showdown', 'film', 'climax', 'futile', 'meaningless', 'McKay', 'Leech', 'earlier', 'brawl', ""'Blood"", 'Feud', 'must', 'be', 'settled', 'blood', 'even', 'when', 'common', 'sense', 'scope', 'Wyler', ""'style"", 'clearly', 'evident', 'pacing', 'characterization', 'THE', 'BIG', 'COUNTRY', 'may', 'have', 'misfired', ""'Anti-Western"", ""'"", 'still', 'entertaining', 'engaging', 'production', 'certainly', 'place', 'film', 'fan', 'collection']",N/A

152622,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,079284517X,Brent Butler,"[2, 2]","*** BLU RAY Update ***I've owned the DVD of this film for years, and it is one of my favorites. So when I recently noticed that there was a Blu ray version out, I jumped right on it. I'm not disappointed.The film was restored between the DVD and Blu ray releases, and it shows.Let's start with the sound: The sound on the Blu ray is rich and clean. If you own the DVD, you may not realize until you hear the Blu ray just how bad the DVD sounds. Going directly back to the DVD immediately after watching the Blu ray, it is easy to tell that the DVD sound has a good bit of distortion in it.The picture on the Blu ray is also much improved in many ways. First, most of the colors are much brighter, especially in outdoor scenes. In the DVD outdoor scenes are either too dark or washed out. In the DVD, the opening scene where the stagecoach is approaching with the town in view makes it look like it is approaching at dusk. In the Blu ray, the scene is much brighter and indicative of a bright early afternoon sunny day. This improvement shows up over and over again in outdoor scenes.In the DVD there is a lot of film damage evident, such as the vertical lines on the right side of the screen during the opening credits. Those were eliminated in the restoration.Overall, the image in the Blu ray is predictably much sharper and detailed. Most of the movie looks a bit soft on the DVD. This is another major improvement.The restoration on the Blu ray is not perfect. The initial sepia toned view of the stagecoach is still pretty bad, and when big sky is showing in the background, it is generally pretty grainy. However, both things look even worse on the DVD, so I guess the restoration team did what they could.This Blu Ray doesn't cost much. If you are a fan of the film and own the DVD, this is absolutely worth the upgrade. If you've never seen this film, or have only seen it on TV, this is a no brainer.The film probably hasn't looked this good since its original theatrical run in 1958.Some reviewers complained that you can't pause the film and restart it without it going back to the beginning. That is only true if your Blu ray player ""goes to sleep"" because it's been on Pause for too long. Even if that happens, you don't have to start at the beginning. Although there is no traditional menu at the start of the film, there is a Pop Up Menu available once the film starts to play. That is where you can find your chapters and three special features. The Blu ray has two special features that were not on the DVD. There is a short ""on the set"" film narrated by Jean Simmons, and a TV commercial for the film from an early ABC broadcast.Obviously, I highly recommend this Blu ray presentation of ""The Big Country"".*********************************************Somehow I missed this western for many decades, and its actually for the best that I did. If I had seen this movie earlier, it would have been a pan and scan version that completely misses great shots in the movie, including one of the most dramatic ever filmed in a western.I first saw this on a TCM showing, which gave me the wide screen version this movie deserves. If you catch it on TV, don't watch it on Encore Westerns, as they show the pan and scan version.For the story itself, the brilliance of this movie is a main character in a western that never fires a shot at a bad guy. In fact, the hero fires only one shot, and that into the dirt.It is easy to think of this film as epic in scope, even tho only a few days are covered by it. The classic conflict between the 'civilized' cattle baron and his backwoods foe sets a stage in which the full panoply of western pageantry is displayed ... everything but a quick drawing hero. ;-) Captain McKay (Gregory Peck) is unarguably the best definition of a ""man's man"" that has ever appeared on film. He is not more heroic or more highly skilled than other film heroes. He is simply the best centered, most self confident man ever in a film role. He doesn't need to prove himself to anyone BUT himself. That is a refreshing and unique take on a film hero.As much as I enjoy the acting and the story of this film, the score is just as magnificent. Majestic and sweeping, it perfectly sets the moods, at once keep tempo with the canter of horses and filling those wide open spaces with a sound you won't forget.Unfortunately, this movie really needs a restoration. There are many ""aged film"" artifacts present. They're not as noticeable on your regular DVD player, but they stand out a lot on upconverted signals. Although I'd love to see a restored blu-ray, I don't know that this film is regarded as commercial enough for that to happen (** Per above, BOY am I glad I was wrong about this!! **), which is a shame, as this is on my personal list of top 5 westerns of all time. Still, this DVD is the best you're going to see of ""The Big Country"" unless a restoration happens, and the movie is too big itself for the flaws to detract from your overall enjoyment.Watch this movie and just enjoy. It is among the top westerns ever made, and likely among the top 25 or so films ever made.",5,"A Classic Western, and a major breaker of the mold",1276473600,"06 14, 2010",2010,5105,"['***', 'BLU',

Family quarrels, a love triangle, individualism, morals, and many more issues insinuate as we hear heralded by a great sound track. But it's like a huge balloon, it has too big a load in it, and hardly raises up above the ground. Almost three hours should be more than enough time to develop whatever issues there are, if only you'd make the most of the time, which, I regret to say, is not the case here.This is a Wyler and Gregory Peck production, that is, a vehicle for Mr. Peck to do his best role, and which only he can do. He plays 'To Kill A Mockingbird' Mr. Finch, the righteous and lovable man who brings his righteousness along to the wild West. His philosophy and that of the untamed man of the West will colide in a very particular way.The cast is excellent; the cinematography is excellent; everything is excellent; but it never quite delivers all the excitement it promises. One example of this is clearly the character of Charlton Heston. This man plays a fundamental role in the film as the opposite of what Peck represents, but he is not developed enough; not that he doesn't do a fine role, actually he is at his best. I personally find him more interesting than Peck's character. Then there is the duality of Ms. Simmons and Ms. Baker's. We hardly see them teaming up together and explaining how two so different personalities have got along. Haven't they learnt anything from each other? Then there's the character played by the rich rancher, Simmons's father. A psichological case with a past we ignore as well. I can't give 5 stars to a film that doesn't tell us 25% of we are made to expect. If it were for expectations this film would be numer one in any list of classic films.Frustrating, that's it. I understand you may still like the film. If one only pays attention superficially, and rates it at face value, you're right.

The acting is universally superb and every actor is cast to perfection in their individual roles. Gregory Peck has rarely been as understated, subtle and magnificent as he is in the title character of the handsome, secure Jim McKay. He is the quintessential American character and only Peck, Jimmy Stewart, or Henry Fonda could lay claim to that mantle. Carroll Baker plays his shrewish, manipulative and petulant girlfriend to a ""T."" Charlton Heston is excellent in a supporting role, as are Charles Bickford and Chuck Connors, who is surprisingly effective as the drunken roustabout Buck. Jean Simmons loses her British accent and delivers a memorable, strong performance as well.Ultimately, the best performance is delivered by Burl Ives, who won a much-deserved Academy Award in his role as the patriarch of the Hannessey clan. Watch particularly for the scene where he disrupts the Major's party and delivers a searing soliloquy on the selfishness and tyrannical tendencies of the Terrell family. This is an acting tour de force from Ives, who is every bit as powerful here as he was playing Big Daddy in ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof."" Another great scene is when Chuck Connors walks into the house and says, ""Pa, did you want me?"" Ives sneers, ""I did before you was born!""The score is incomparable, the mesmerizing string section will have you humming for days. The cinematography is eerily derivative of John Ford and the sweeping vistas makes you want to be there, in every frame.There are some clich&eacute;s, notably the fight scene between Peck and Heston, which goes on too long and is a little contrived. The ending is also melodramatic and improbable, yet somehow a fitting climax to this wonderful movie. Rarely has an ensemble cast been so universally excellent, the acting alone makes this a truly outstanding film. I rooted for the Hannessey's throughout the film, others may opt for the Terrell's, but it doesn't really matter in the end.

Garard Jr. PhD""","[1, 4]","THE BIG COUNTRY is what the big screen was created for, and THE BIG COUNTRY was certainly created for the big screen. Wide open spaces in the American west never looked so vast and intimidating, so welcoming and foreboding.Some have argued that the plot is too thin for such a lengthy running time. When I first saw it as a youth on the screen of my father's small-town theatre, it seemed just like another western -- if longer than most. It seemed to lack the punch of a character-driven, action-filled western like WARLOCK or the excitement of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN -- still two of my all-time favorite westerns. Viewing it on DVD as an adult, I have changed my mind. I have since come to appreciate the skills of quintessential director William Wyler, the master of the mise-en-scene (or the arrangement of people and objects on the screen). Orson Welles may have originated the creative use of deep focus photography, but Wyler has utilized it to the point of perfection in THE BIG COUNTRY.The repetition of the line ""it's a big country"" became a humorous point for a friend of mine from graduate school and I to have fun with, but this is appropriate for the wide-screen vistas and almost leisurely pace of this now-classic motion picture. Wyler breaks a few stereotypes by allowing the characters in some of the more important action sequences to be photographed from a distance -- the fist fight between Peck and Heston, and the final shootout between Ives and Bickford. Human beings are dwarfed by the landscape, often seen as no more than insects -- a decision purposely made by Wyler and his cinematographer to emphasize their petty hatreds and feuds. Particularly stirring is the sequence early in the film where the Terrill men, led by the Major (Bickford), gallop through the bleached-white canyon to reach the modest ranch of the Hannassey family. The music score accompanying this ride is stirring and grandiose. One might wonder, in fact, what this film would be like without this magnificent soundtrack. From the opening title sequence to the wordless finale, it is orchestral perfection -- possibly one of the greatest motion picture scores ever.Although William Wyler's later production BED-HUR won scores of awards, THE BIG COUNTRY is, in my view, a greater film. Burl Ives deserved the Oscar for his role as the patriarch of a clan of cattlemen who are down-scale from their opponents -- the Terrills -- an actor who can hold our attention by merely looking out the window away from the camera. Despite his lower-class environment and his obvious hatred for Terrill (Bickford), he is still a man of justice and fair-play. In his struggle against the wealthy Major, he is the antagonist with whom we would be more likely to sympathize. His own son Buck (Chuck Connors) with a few two many rough edges is clearly a disappointment to him; he would prefer that Buck acquire a few of the gentlemanly attributes possessed by the eastern newcomer Jim McKay (Gregory Peck). The action he takes when he is forced to choose honor over love for his son might strain credibility for some viewers, but Ives makes his choice believable and touching.Gregory Peck and Jean Simmons as the top-lined of the four leads are, at times, hard to swallow. Both are so virtuous as to be almost nauseating. Simmons is as beautiful as she was earlier in THE EGYPTIAN and later in SPARTACUS; she is a schoolteacher never seen near a schoolroom who had can afford a house to herself. Salaries in those small towns must have been more generous than they are for teachers today. All well-drawn characters are shown to have a dark or shadowy side, as we all have as human beings, but these two characters lack even a trace of a shadow. A character who has a shadow side but is able to overcome it in the end in order to emerge triumphant is not only more believable but compelling and enjoyable in a dramatic sense.Peck appears as an eastern gentleman whose sense of honor and hatred of violence remains steadfast throughout. Only twice does he resort to fisticuffs -- once against Heston and later against Connors. In both cases, he appears to be over-matched physically. He is the one-dimensional purveyor of morality and justice -- the squeaky clean goodie-two-shoes who might be more believable if he were wearing a parson's grab. Peck (that ""skinny liberal"" as John Wayne once called him) has portrayed these morally upright characters before and since, mostly notably as a lawman in MacKENNA'S GOLD. The way he keeps dodging the physical affections of the amorous Native American lass (Julie Newmar) stretches credibility beyond the breaking point. In DUEL IN THE SUN, Peck plays a spoiled outlaw, again squaring off against Charles Bickford. In that film, however, the roles are reversed: Bickford is the older decent character who falls in love with Peck's backstreet half-breed mistress, Jennifer Jones -- unfortunately for him as Peck guns him down mercilessly.Heston, not a great actor, is more believable as a character who changes his perspective regarding violence. He decides that he has fought the Major's battles long enough -- even though he relents at the last minute and is wounded in a canyon battle for his efforts. Carroll Baker is also more believable than the Simmons character as a spoiled daddy's girl with an Electra complex. The ending of the film leaves a few questions in our minds, trying to figure out what might happen beyond the classical happy ending.In China, I often show films about American history when I am explaining the development of the English language. I have, for example, shown NEW WORLD, REVOLUTION, HOW THE WEST WAS WON, and others. I am planning on showing such films as THE LAST FRONTIER as believable views of the west as it was. THE BIG COUNTRY, one of the great westerns like SHANE and THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, would also be an appropriate choice to show the wide vistas of the American west and the concerns of those humans who are often, as shown in THE BIG COUNTRY, dwarfed by the landscape.",5,A wide-screen epic for the panoramic screen,1277337600,"06 24, 2010",2010,6038,"['BIG', 'COUNTRY', 'what', 'big', 'screen', 'was',

152632,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,079284517X,Chrijeff,"[6, 6]","Jim McKay (Peck), a former sea captain and son of a Baltimore family that &quot;owns a whole fleet of ships,&quot; arrives by stage in what is probably west Texas to marry Pat Terrell (Baker), whose father, Major Henry Terrell (Bickford), owns Ladder, the premiere cattle spread of the district.  He meets Pat's friend Julie Maragon (Simmons) and the Ladder foreman Steve Leach (Heston) and has a confrontation with Buck Hennessy (Connors), who, he soon learns, comes of a family with which Terrell has been feuding for years.  When the patriarch of the clan, Rufus (Ives in his Best Supporting Actor role), crashes the engagement party Terrell is throwing for the couple, McKay resolves to keep the feud from exploding, and arranges to buy Julie's inheritance, Big Muddy, promising to throw its eponymous river open to all in need--Hennessys and Ladder alike.  Before he can publicize his act, he quarrels with Pat, who breaks off their engagement, and Julie is kidnapped by Buck, partly because he wants her and partly because his father hopes to use her as bait to draw Ladder into a trap.  Only now does McKay realize who he's really in love with, and he sets off to avert a massacre.  What follows leaves the younger generation in charge, and viewers are left with the impression that McKay will marry Julie--possibly leaving Pat for Leach, who, it is implied, was jealous of their relationship and had hoped to get Pat for himself.Adapted by Jessamyn West from the only Western novel written by Donald Hamilton (of Matt Helm fame), this is generally considered a classic of the genre as well as an epic film.  William Wyler (who, with Peck, also co-produced) is one of the best-known directors of the post-War era.  Though the pace is perhaps a bit slow, older kids and adults should quickly pick up on the thread of tension that runs through the entire movie, beginning with the introduction of Buck Hennessy and his confrontation with McKay and building inevitably to the final Jim/Buck and Terrell/Rufus showdowns.  I personally would have thought it improved by at least a brief explanation of how the feud got started, and can't help wondering why Julie, who apparently was raised on Big Muddy by her grandfather Clem, didn't simply hire a good foreman and crew and continue to run it, as many Western heiresses--widows and daughters alike--are historically shown to have done.  But it's the characters that make the story: McKay, who's determined to follow his own sense of right and wrong even when it earns him scorn and mockery from Buck and Leach and loss of faith from Pat; Rufus and Terrell, two strong men determined not to give an inch (several of Rufus's lines suggest he &quot;came from better&quot;); Buck, sneeringly played by &quot;The Rifleman&quot; Connors in a dark drooping mustache that makes him look positively sinister; Pat, pretty but clearly spoiled; Julie, darkly smooth and cool to Pat's fiery blondness; Leach, a strong, proud cowman who seems reluctant to come out with his feelings for the boss's daughter, notwithstanding that he's probably her natural match.

The production did not go smoothly at all, between conflicts with director Wyler and constant rewritings of the script during filming.  I would not have known that from watching the movie.  Gregory Peck's character has a maturity you hardly ever see in a movie, completely undefensive and unconcerned about what others think.  There's a great line in which he says a man is only responsible for what he is, not for what others think of him.  He comes to the ranch of his fiancee's wealthy family and finds out how ruthless even sophisticated people can be towards their neighbors, the Hannasseys.  Over time, the feud between Peck's fiancee's family (the Terrills) and the Hannasseys escalates, despite all Peck and his NEW love interest (Jean Simmons) try to do to ease the tension.  While Peck and Simmons have a happy ending, the movie's theme is tragic, showing the consequences of unchecked pride by the bloodbath at the end.  Wyler's cinematography also makes a statement about violence.  In a nighttime fight between Peck and Charlton Heston, Wyler shows the tinyness of human conflict against the larger landscape, making a statement about the pettiness of human violence.  Eisenhower showed this movie several times in the White House and likely thought of the nuclear arms race when watching this.  Though this movie is much less well-known than Ben-Hur, Charlton Heston's performance in this movie likely guaranteed him the role of Judah Ben-Hur, the next movie Wyler directed.",5,The movie that made me love Gregory Peck,1322265600,"11 26, 2011",2011,1606,"['As', 'soon', 'started', 'watching', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'high-quality', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'William', 'Wyler', 'production', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'smoothly', 'conflicts', 'director', 'Wyler', 'constant', 'rewritings', 'script', 'filming', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'known', 'watching', 'movie', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'character', 'maturity', 'hardly', 'ever', 'see', 'movie', 'completely', 'undefensive', 'unconcerned', 'what', 'others', 'think', 'great', 'line', 'man', 'only', 'responsible', 'what', 'not', 'what', 'others', 'think', 'ranch', 'fiancee', 'wealthy', 'family', 'out', 'how', 'ruthless', 'even', 'sophisticated', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'towards', 'neighbors', 'Hannasseys', 'time', 'feud', 'Peck', 'fiancee', 'family', 'Terrills', 'Hannasseys', 'Peck', 'NEW', 'love', 'interest', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'try', 'do', 'ease', 'tension', 'Peck', 'Simmons', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'movie', 'theme', 'tragic', 'showing', 'consequences', 'unchecked', 'pride', 'bloodbath', 'end', 'Wyler', 'cinematography', 'also', 'statement', 'violence', 'nighttime', 'fight', 'Peck', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Wyler', 'tinyness', 'human', 'conflict', 'larger', 'landscape', 'making', 'statement', 'pettiness', 'human', 'violence', 'Eisenhower', 'showed', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'White', 'House', 'likely', 'thought', 'nuclear', 'arms', 'race', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'much', 'less', 'well-known', 'Ben-Hur', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'performance', 'movie', 'likely', 'guaranteed', 'role', 'Judah', 'Ben-Hur', 'next', 'movie', 'Wyler', 'directed']",N/A

Almost all of the left-wing allegory of the Cold War that William Wyler et al intended in the film is lost to history and will only be noticed by those looking for it.  The cast is so fabulous that Charlton Heston is a secondary star in this film.  He plays Steve Leech, the foreman of the Terrill Ranch and was raised there since a boy by Major Terrill (played by Charles Bickford).Gregory Peck plays James McKay, a ship's captain who has come to this ""Big Country"" to marry the Major's daughter, Patricia (pronounced Patreesha by the Major) played by Caroll Baker.  McKay immediately finds himself embroiled in the fight between the poorer but more numerous Hannasseys and the Terrills, who consider themselves more deserving and elite.  Each side wants another ranch owned by the local school teacher Julie Maragon (Jean Simmons) because it has the only water in the region.  Her family has had the ranch since the family was given it by Mexico generations previously.  One of the people McKay has trouble with is the foreman Leech because Leech wants Patricia, but can't have her (since he is a hand and not good enough).McKay is bewildered by the fight and everyone fails to read McKay correctly.  They see his being unwilling to fight and escalate trouble as cowardice and his shrewdness in not being duped into riding a horse that would throw him as timidity.  McKay goes about doing what he thinks best when he thinks best and this causes him some trouble, but he has a higher goal in mind.  Of course things culminate in a large conflict, but not in the way you might predict and even if you do, it is handled very well.Burl Ives plays Rufus, the head of the Hannassey clam  He is so compelling on the screen that he won the Oscar for best supporting actor in 1958 for this role.  Chuck Connors (only 11 years Ives junior) plays his oldest son, Buck.

The story is a variation on the tried-and-true &quot;Eastern Dude Tames Wild West&quot; theme.  Co-produced by director William Wyler and star Gregory Peck, it strives a bit self-consciously for epic grandeur, and lacks the comparatively gritty realism of John Ford's thematically related THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE.As the transplanted Easterner, Peck's understated performance is a pleasure to watch.  Jean Simmons is fine as the schoolmarm, and the two Chucks (Conners and Heston) are equally good in their roles.  A supporting actor Oscar went to Burl Ives, but the standout performance belongs to Carroll Baker as Peck's spoiled fiance.  Franz Planer's cinematography is quite good, too, but like the script, performances, and pacing, it's just a little bit too self-conscious.  The picture feels more like OKLAHOMA! than like THE SEARCHERS--altogether too theatrical to sustain the suspension of disbelief.Yet this is a very entertaining movie--at least for those who value character, conflict, and beautiful imagery over car chases, explosions, and other special effects.

Brilliant acting from one powerhouse cast of Peck, the eternally gorgeous Jean Simmons, dynamic Burl Eves, Chuck Connors, Charleton Heston, Charles Bickford and Carol Baker, with a script that is smart, incisive, with heart and soul.  It is sweeping, humorous and romantic, with Peck showing a man does not have to be macho, just comfortable with himself.Beautifully filmed, one of William Wyler's best.

152647,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,079284517X,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 4]","In 1958, renown filmmaker William Wyler (""Ben-Hur"", ""Roman Holiday"", ""Funny Girl"") and actor Gregor Peck (""How to Kill a Mockingbird"", ""Roman Holiday"", ""The Guns of Navarone"") would collaborate together to create film adaptation of ""The Big Country"".  A film that was based on the serialized magazine novel ""Ambush at Blanco Canyon"" by Donald Hamilton.The film would feature an all-star cast starring Jean Simmons (""Spartacus"", ""Guys and Dolls"", ""The Happy Ending""), Charlton Heston (""Ben-Hur"", ""Touch of Evil"", ""The Ten Commandments""), Carroll Baker (""Giant"", ""Baby Doll""), Burl Ives (""East of Eden"", ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"") and Charles Bickford (""A Star is Born"", ""The Men from Shiloh"", ""Days of Wine and Roses"").The film won an Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor and was also nominated for its musical score by Jerome Moross.VIDEO:""The Big Country"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (Widescreen 2:35:1).  For the most part, the restoration by the Academy and the Film Foundation is wonderful.  There is a lot of clarity and detail, especially with closeups.  The contrast is good and although not a vibrant film, it still looks better than any video release.  The Blu-ray release definitely brings out the detail in the film.  Black levels are good and for the most part and there is some minor flickering, mostly towards the top of the film.  But that is just me being a bit nitpicky.I did notice a problem (which were short).  Probably the most noticeable was when James goes to talk to Julie at the Hannassey Ranch, there is this moment where the picture quality looks distorted.  It's only several seconds long but I was surprised to see this distortion for a film that has received considerable restoration.But for the most part, the film looks great on Blu-ray!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Big Country"" is presented in English Mono DTS-HD, Spanish Mono and French mono.  For the most part, the dialogue is clear and according to my receiver, it's a monaural track going through both front speakers.  So, it is a 2.0 mix.  The good news is that the restoration was faithful to its monaural soundtrack via lossless but anyone hoping for anything more, such as a 5.1 lossless and immersive soundtrack, unfortunately not on this Blu-ray release. But it would have been great to hear Jerome Moross' wonderful musical soundtrack via 5.1 HD.Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.SPECIAL FEATURES""The Big Country"" comes with the following special features:Fun in the Big Country - (5:12) Presented in standard definition, Jean Simmons narrates a short featurette on what the cast and crew are doing behind-the-scenes during their break.TV Spot - (:53) Original television spot in HD.Trailer - (2:53) The original theatrical trailer in HD.JUDGMENT CALL:There is no question that William Wyler is one of America's finest filmmakers.  And when it comes to collaborations, Wyler and actor Gregory Peck did a wonderful job with ""The Big Country"".And what I enjoyed about this film is how it differs from other westerns that are typically focused on violence and retaliation, while those elements are in the film, to have a character such as James McKay, a man from the city who is not so eager to engage in violence and does all he can to stop it. You just don't see Westerns with that type of protagonist.  Gregory Peck has been known for his activism and as an advocate for peace (especially vocal against the Vietnam War and even being put on Richard Nixon's enemy list because of his anti-war activism), but you can see how conscious he was to showcasing peace without violence through""The Big Country"".The film would also be important for the career of Charlton Heston.  With two big films in 1958 with ""The Big Country"" and ""Touch of Evil"", working with director William Wyler would eventually unite them for Wyler's next film ""Ben-Hur"" which would net the actor his first Academy Award for ""Best Actor in a Leading Role"".But ""The Big Country"" is a rather interesting storyline that grabs you.  You have the rivalry between the Terrill's and the Hannassey's.  You have the four-way love complexities between McKay, Patricia, Steve and Julie but what I found most intriguing is the tough love between father Rufus Hannassey and his son Buck.  Rufus is a man who grew up with tough love and does the same for his family but within that tough man exterior, you wonder how far he'll go with his threats.  So, to see how things progress in the final leg of the film, I was really drawn into the film because of that family dynamic between father and son.As mentioned earlier, a lot of star talent in this film and the performances are well-done.  The production and costume design are also well-done and capture the look and feel of the west.  Cinematography by Franz Planer (""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", ""Roman Holiday"", ""The Caine Mutiny"") was breathtaking but also ambitious.  Especially around the canyon scenes and also even during the beginning when the Hannasey boys were showing of their risky horse riding.  Even actor Roddy McDowall makes an appearance as a watchman for Hannassey family.While a Western among many Westerns released during that time, ""The Big Country"" is far from being part of the Western banality of films that people are used to seeing from the 1950's-1960's.  Sure, America loved the Western revenge/violent or action-based films but to see a film in which the protagonist tries to stop the violence, those films are quite the rarity. You do get your action, but you also get a deep story with good character development.Overall, the restoration of ""The Big Country"" on Blu-ray definitely looks better than its previous video counterparts.  While I did see some video-related glitches, I was hoping for a more immersive lossless soundtrack and also was hoping to see more special features, especially for this beloved western outside of a short featurette and trailers.  But if you are a big fan of ""The Big Country"", the Blu-ray release is definitely worth owning and is also recommended!",4,Blu-ray: Definitely a fantastic William Wyler film to own on Blu-ray and

Some of the classic films on his resume have been showered with awards.  Films like &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives,&quot; &quot;Mrs. Miniver,&quot; &quot;Roman Holiday,&quot; and my personal favorite from his extensive catalog, the 1959 version of &quot;Ben-Hur.&quot;  Those four films alone collected nearly 30 Oscars between them!  His work is very impressive, and this film has all the ambition one could possibly hope for from such a celebrated director.  The scope of the picture is immense, with panoramic vistas beautifully photographed, great costume design and set decorations, and a large cast of legendary actors.  All the acting is first-rate, the supporting cast equaling even the greatest performances here.  Charlton Heston, Gregory Peck, and Jean Simmons all do splendid star turns, while Burl Ives gives his all in his Oscar-winning performance.  But this is William Wyler's film, and his outstanding work here is what makes this so enjoyable.  The variety of camera angles he uses keeps everything fresh and lively, changing persepctives from mountain tops to showing part of a scene from what it would look like if the audience was watching from under a bed.  This is a classic style Western, the kind they just don't make anymore.  It has a huge cast, magnificent locales, professional direction and high production values.  The only complaint I have it that it is slightly dated, but by the end of the movie I really didn't mind all that much, the acting is so good and the production is so grand in scale.  There is one flaw in the story.  Just one glaring flaw.  When a large group of men ride into a canyon and a large barricade falls, blocking their way, they retreat back the way they came only to be boxed in when another, similarly large barricade falls, blocking their retreat.  They couldn't see the first barricade on their way in?  It was huge, and not camoflauged in any way.  That is the only reason I can't give this otherwise entertaining film 5 stars.  However, this is a fun film.  A quintessential Western epic with superb direction from William Wyler and excellent acting from the entire cast. My favorite scene is a long fight between Charlton Heston and Gregory Peck at night on the prairie, with only the cows watching them exhaust themselves.

Nuce,"[1, 2]","PlotJim McKay (Gregory Peck) an Eastern sea captain travels west to marry his fianc&eacute; (Carol Baker) and finds himself in the middle of a feud between his father-in-law (Charles Bickford) and a dirt poor group of white trash.  Also caught up in the feud is Bickford's foreman (Charlton Heston, a year before he won an academy award for Ben Hur), a school-teacher who owns the deed to a valuable piece of land both sides want (Jean Simmons), and Burl Ives in an academy award winning role.  William Wyler (Ben Hur, Mrs. Miniver) directs this classic film from 1958.ViolencePG-rated violence throughout.  Gregory Peck and Charlton Heston have a long drawn out fistfight which ends with both being slightly bloodied.  A few characters are shot and killed.  Some blood is visible in these scenes, but not much.  Peck is beaten up in several scenes, one involving his character being hog-tied and dragged through the dust.  It is implied that Heston pummels several tied up men for this.Sexual ContentVery little.  Connors tries to force himself on Jean Simmons (typical kissing, but no nudity or movement at all).  He is beaten off by his father, Burl Ives.  There is some mild kissing in a few scenes.  Connors is scene exiting the window of a building that appears to be a brothel with an angry woman (fully clothed), yelling at him.LanguagePG-cussing.  Some scattered H-words and d-words that can be counted on both sets of fingers.MoralesPeck suffers constantly because he refuses to show off in front of other people or defend himself.  As he tells Simmons later, he only needs to prove himself to himself.  He attempts to make peace between the two warring factions, and proves heroic in his attempt to rescue Simmons from her captors.Heston realizes the war is wrong, but follows his leader because of loyalty into battle.  Boozing and womanizing are discouraged by the film.  Connors is the object of the viewers loathing, and he is the one who follows both practices.The Big Country is well... a BIG movie.  With stars like Gregory Peck, Charlton Heston, Burl Ives, Carol Baker, Jean Simmons and up and comer Chuck Connors (of the Rifleman fame) it is very well written and full of meaning and depth.  However, there is very little action, and the film is just a bit too long.  There is very little troubling content in this film, and most families will find it very watchable.  The musical score is tremendously good.  There are several good dramatic scenes and even a few hysterically funny scenes.  Parents will enjoy seeing the favorite actors of their youth, and children may enjoy seeing a type of film they seldom get to with today's adult content.  That said, the MTV crowd will fine this film tedious.  Too bad, maybe they could have learned a few lessons from Jim McKay instead of watching their mind-numbing music videos and action movies of today.",4,They Don't Get Much Bigger,1252454400,"09 9, 2009",2009,2869,"['PlotJim', 'McKay', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Eastern', 'sea', 'captain', 'west', 'marry', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Carol', 'Baker', 'middle', 'feud', 'father-in-law', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'dirt', 'poor', 'group', 'white', 'trash', 'Also', 'caught', 'up', 'feud', 'Bickford', 'foreman', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'year', 'won', 'academy', 'award', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'school-teacher', 'who', 'deed', 'valuable', 'piece', 'land', 'sides', 'want', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'academy', 'award', 'winning', 'role', 'William', 'Wyler', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'Mrs.', 'Miniver', 'classic', 'film', '1958.ViolencePG-rated', 'violence', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'have', 'long', 'drawn', 'fistfight', 'being', 'slightly', 'bloodied', 'few', 'characters', 'are', 'shot', 'killed', 'blood', 'visible', 'scenes', 'not', 'much', 'Peck', 'beaten', 'up', 'several', 'scenes', 'one', 'involving', 'character', 'being', 'hog-tied', 'dragged', 'dust', 'implied', 'Heston', 'several', 'tied', 'up', 'men', 'this.Sexual', 'ContentVery', 'little', 'Connors', 'force', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'typical', 'kissing', 'nudity', 'movement', 'beaten', 'off', 'father', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'mild', 'kissing', 'few', 'scenes', 'Connors', 'scene', 'exiting', 'window', 'building', 'be', 'brothel', 'angry', 'woman', 'fully', 'clothed', 'yelling', 'him.LanguagePG-cussing', 'scattered', 'H-words', 'd-words', 'can', 'be', 'counted', 'sets', 'fingers.MoralesPeck', 'suffers', 'constantly', 'show', 'off', 'front', 'other', 'people', 'defend', 'Simmons', 'later', 'only', 'prove', 'make', 'peace', 'two', 'warring', 'factions', 'heroic', 'attempt', 'rescue', 'Simmons', 'captors.Heston', 'war', 'wrong', 'leader', 'loyalty', 'battle', 'Boozing', 'womanizing', 'are', 'discouraged', 'film', 'Connors', 'object', 'viewers', 'loathing', 'one', 'who', 'practices.The', 'Big', 'Country', 'well', 'BIG', 'movie', 'stars', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'Carol', 'Baker', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'up', 'comer', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'Rifleman', 'fame', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'full', 'meaning', 'depth', 'However', 'very', 'little', 'action', 'film', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'very', 'little', 'troubling', 'content', 'film', 'most', 'families', 'will', 'find', 'very', 'watchable', 'musical', 'score', 'tremendously', 'good', 'are', 'several', 'good', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'even', 'few', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'scenes', 'Parents', 'will', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'favorite', 'actors', 'youth', 'children', 'may', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'type', 'film', 'seldom', 'get', 'today', 'adult', 'content', 'said', 'MTV', 'crowd', 'will', 'fine', 'film', 'tedious', 'Too', 'bad', 'maybe', 'could', 'have', 'learned', 'few', 'lessons', 'Jim', 'McKay', 'instead', 'watching', 'mind-numbing', 'music', 'videos', 'action', 'movies', 'today']",N/A

152663,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,079284517X,Erik North,"[0, 0]","Movies rarely subscribe to the notion of Truth In Advertising in their titles, and that's even more the case in our day and age.  But director William Wyler's 1958 western opus THE BIG COUNTRY more than lives up to that notion.  The 1950s were really the era in which the Western evolved away from the traditional cowboys-and-Indians stereotype to stories that reflected the times in which the films were made.  On a fairly grand scale, given its 167-minute running time, THE BIG COUNTRY does all that, and then some.Based on the novel by Donald Hamilton, this grand Western epic stars Gregory Peck (who co-produced the film with Wyler) as a ship's captain who ventures out West to finally marry the woman (Carroll Baker) that he has been pining for.  What he ends up involving himself in, however, is a lot more complicated.  Baker is part of a very upscale family, with Charles Bickford portraying the patriarch, involved in a significant feud with the much lower-class Hennessys, whose patriarch is portrayed by Burl Ives (who justly won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar), over a huge spread known as the Big Muddy.  Both have vast cattle operations; both need the water that this river provides in a land that is not exactly flush with it; but neither will give an inch to the other.  But the most important stretch of the Big Muddy is owned by a friend of Baker's, a schoolteacher played by Jean Simmons.  Peck agrees to sign the deed that will make him co-owner of the spread with Simmons in order to placate both sides, but in the end it all comes down to an armed confrontation between the two warring families in the very narrow confines of Blanco Canyon.Reputed to be then-president Eisenhower's favorite film, THE BIG COUNTRY is very much a film about class warfare, with Bickford being high-tone to a fault, and Ives and his clan essentially resembling what one might call ""redneck"" or ""white trash"", placing Peck, Simmons, and Baker in the middle.  But there's a lot more to it, thanks to Wyler's exacting direction, and the incredible wide screen cinematography of Franz Planer, much of it shot on locations in the San Joaquin Valley in central California; Red Rock Canyon in the Mojave Desert; and Canyon de Chelly National Park in Arizona.  Peck, not surprisingly, delivers another strong but low-key performance, with Simmons and Baker doing good turns as well.  Chuck Connors makes an early (pre-""Rifleman"") appearance as Ives' none-too-sharp kid; and Charlton Heston, here billed fourth, does an equally solid turn as Bickford's foreman who takes an instant dislike to Peck until a nighttime fistfight between the two men in the back forty proves to him that Peck is indeed a man.  The icing on the cake is the unforgettable music score by Jerome Moross, one of the best for any film, Western or otherwise, in history, and an aspect of the film that should have also received an Oscar.While it may seem radically dated by now, THE BIG COUNTRY still has plenty to recommend it.  And if you are a fan of Westerns, this is an absolute must-have, alongside HIGH NOON, SHANE, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, and THE WILD BUNCH.",5,"Waist-Deep In The ""Big Muddy"" With Gregory Peck and Company",1384128000,"11 11, 2013",2013,3159,"['Movies', 'rarely', 'subscribe', 'notion', 'Truth', 'Advertising', 'titles', 'even', 'more', 'case', 'day', 'age', 'director', 'William', 'Wyler', '1958', 'western', 'THE', 'BIG', 'COUNTRY', 'more', 'up', 'notion', '1950s', 'were', 'really', 'era', 'Western', 'evolved', 'away', 'traditional', 'cowboys-and-Indians', 'stereotype', 'stories', 'reflected', 'times', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'fairly', 'grand', 'scale', 'given', '167-minute', 'running', 'time', 'THE', 'BIG', 'COUNTRY', 'then', 'some.Based', 'novel', 'Donald', 'Hamilton', 'grand', 'Western', 'epic', 'stars', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'who', 'co-produced', 'film', 'Wyler', 'ship', 'captain', 'who', 'ventures', 'out', 'West', 'finally', 'marry', 'woman', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'been', 'pining', 'What', 'up', 'involving', 'however', 'lot', 'more', 'complicated', 'Baker', 'part', 'very', 'upscale', 'family', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'portraying', 'patriarch', 'involved', 'significant', 'feud', 'much', 'lower-class', 'Hennessys', 'patriarch', 'portrayed', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'who', 'justly', 'won', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'huge', 'spread', 'known', 'Big', 'Muddy', 'have', 'vast', 'cattle', 'operations', 'need', 'water', 'river', 'land', 'not', 'exactly', 'will', 'give', 'inch', 'other', 'most', 'important', 'stretch', 'Big', 'Muddy', 'owned', 'friend', 'Baker', 'schoolteacher', 'played', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'Peck', 'sign', 'deed', 'will', 'make', 'co-owner', 'spread', 'Simmons', 'order', 'placate', 'sides', 'end', 'down', 'armed', 'confrontation', 'two', 'warring', 'families', 'very', 'narrow', 'confines', 'Blanco', 'Canyon.Reputed', 'be', 'then-president', 'Eisenhower', 'favorite', 'film', 'THE', 'BIG', 'COUNTRY', 'very', 'much', 'film', 'class', 'warfare', 'Bickford', 'being', 'high-tone', 'fault', 'Ives', 'clan', 'essentially', 'resembling', 'what', 'one', 'might', 'call', 'redneck', 'white', 'trash', 'placing', 'Peck', 'Simmons', 'Baker', 'middle', 'lot', 'more', 'thanks', 'Wyler', 'exacting', 'direction', 'incredible', 'wide', 'screen', 'cinematography', 'Franz', 'Planer', 'much', 'locations', 'San', 'Joaquin', 'Valley', 'central', 'California', 'Red', 'Rock', 'Canyon', 'Mojave', 'Desert', 'Canyon', 'de', 'Chelly', 'National', 'Park', 'Arizona', 'Peck', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'delivers', 'strong', 'low-key', 'performance', 'Simmons', 'Baker', 'doing', 'good', 'turns', 'as', 'well', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'early', 'pre-', 'Rifleman', 'appearance', 'Ives', 'none-too-sharp', 'kid', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'here', 'billed', 'fourth', 'equally', 'solid', 'turn', 'Bickford', 'foreman', 'who', 'instant', 'dislike', 'Peck', 'nighttime', 'fistfight', 'two', 'men', 'back', 'forty', 'proves', 'Peck', 'indeed', 'man', 'icing', 'cake', 'unforgettable', 'music', 'score', 'Jerome', 'Moross', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'Western', 'otherwise', 'history', 'aspect', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'also', 'received', 'may', 'seem', 'radically', 'dated', 'now', 'THE', 'BIG', 'COUNTRY', 'still', 'plenty', 'recommend', 'are', 'fan', 'Westerns', 'absolute', 'must-have', 'alongside', 'HIGH', 'NOON', 'SHANE', 'THE', 'MAGNIFICENT', 'SEVEN', 'ONCE', 'A', 'TIME', 'IN', 'THE', 'WEST', 'THE', 'WILD', 'BUNCH']",N/A

152665,A15BHDNAUEBEKP,079284517X,Evelina,"[0, 3]","A very well acted enjoyable movie that is not what you think it is when you first see it. Upon first viewing, its maturity and reason are impressive.  I saw it first as a teenager and loved McKay (Peck), the educated cool easterner among hot headed, seemingly thick headed, westerners.  McKay is relaxed, non aggressive, eschews violence, values reason.  Yet he is very masculine and very handsome (and Peck is unbelievably good looking).  Leech the overtly macho man, strong and powerfully built (Heston), every motion and gesture brimming over with testosterone, calls him a liar, but McKay refuses to be goaded into a fight.  His fianc&eacute; (Carroll Baker) is ashamed and disgusted by this seeming cowardice.  Later, without anyone knowing, when all are asleep, McKay goes to Leech and offers to fight him.  They fight to a draw.  Leech for the first time gets some respect for Mckay.  He sees that he is not a coward, that he has honor, and manhood.McKay also refuses to ride a wild mustang in front of everyone.  He refuses to prove himself.  Later he goes out and breaks the horse by himself.He can fight as good as the most masculine man. He is a real man. Yet at the same time he questions the values of those who are more conventionally masculine. This is how the movie is set up. By having McKay verbally refuse to do these things, the movie makes it seem as if a genuine inquiry is being presented to us by the Peck character. That is how it seemed to my teenage mind. The movie seems to say Violence is bad.  A real man does not have to be aggressive or violent. But now I question the way these values are presented in the movie.  In the end it gives you the same old Hollywood ending, which because of the issues raised make it seem even more false than usual.Peck is the soft man who rejects violence, yet who can fight as well as the tough guy, who if he does fight, will win because he is as strong, maybe stronger, than the more masculine seeming man. It is the old iron hand in the velvet glove. He appears soft but is not.  He can take on a wild horse and win. This is more false than the fantasy of the strong John Wayne or Heston type who wins the battle.  In the old fantasy, the man who cares about fighting and winning does that. The man who appears like he can't fight can't. Yet the new fantasy tells us this is not so.  So in the new fantasy, you get to look down on violence and at the same time employ it. Our hero does not like violence, but he can fight and win with the best of them. This is the lie.  In the end, our soft spoken guy, who is a bit intellectual like, can whip anyone.A movie maker that really wanted to address cowardice and what makes a man a man would make the character not so tall and handsome. It would have been more brave to have him lose the fight with Leech. It would have been still braver to have him not fight at all and to see how that went down. He should not have ridden the horse.  Maybe we should have had a scene where the horse threw him and he gave up trying to tame it.  That would have been a challenge to the audience and the characters in the movie.  Could we still respect him after losing the fight. If he could not win the fight or would not fight, what then would his manhood consist of? What if we had a scene with him getting beat up by Leech and we see how the Jean Simmons character (the one who really loves him) reacts to that.As it plays out, his actions are childish and immature. But admirable ultimately.  He must sneak away in the dead of night to reclaim his manhood. In the end, his values are not that different from that of the overtly manly macho guy. He values his honor. He cannot bear to be called a coward.  On the one hand, he is not happy that his fianc&eacute; expects him to prove himself by fighting.  He wants her to love him despite his seeming cowardice because he needs her to realize that he is not really afraid to fight.  He wants her to realize that inside he is a macho man.  So although seeming to reject her values, he actually respects them. He still must go and fight.So the woman loves the man who acts like he won't fight who deep down inside knows he must fight and who will fight and who will be victorious.On top of everything else, he is rich. He buys a coveted piece of land. So he is the perfect hero out of a book, soft spoken, modest, quiet, sensitive, but at the same time very self confident, totally secure in himself, physically strong, able to use violence as well as any macho man, and wealthy to boot.We are told that McKay's attitude towards violence came about because his father died in a duel and no one can remember what it was about.  We are supposed to think that dueling is nonsense, which it is to us.  But dueling for many centuries in many cultures was taken very seriously.  It involved honor and insults to honor, just as in the inner city today, we hear of violence provoked over a ""dis.""  The violence resulting from the ""dis"" is often attributed to the supposed weakness of the inner city dwellers. Yet for a long time, dueling for what seems like nonsensical reasons was the prerogative of aristocrats, the wealthy and powerful.I am not arguing we should act like this, only that such behavior has deep roots in human culture and that we should not always say everything in the past is due to inexplicable stupidity.And in the end, he rescues his love like any hero should.  The romance with Jean Simmons, the growth of their affection is very affecting.  Just the way they look at each other is really great. You see love, although I don't think they touch each other once in the movie.  We can see that they are made for each other.  She understands him, his strength and also his weakness.  She sees beneath the educated exterior to the real man. His fianc&eacute; can't do that. She belongs with Leech, the overtly masculine man. It is a lovely tale on many different levels, a lovely fantasy.",5,a lovely liberal fantasy,1255910400,"10 19, 2009",2009,5949,"['very', 'well', 'acted', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'think',

152675,A7Y6AVS576M03,079284517X,gobirds2,"[21, 21]","I think Peck's best performance was in 1958s THE BIG COUNTRY. THE BIG COUNTRY is based on Donald Hamilton's novel of the same name. Gregory Peck plays the central character named James McKay. McKay was a sea captain who looked and acted like something of a dandy as he relocated out west from back east to marry his fianc&eacute;e. McKay was a man who had nothing to prove to anyone but himself. I read the novel. Gregory Peck is James McKay. Peck chose this project and co-produced it because I think he recognized that particular character in the novel that mirrored his approach to many of the roles he chose. There are wooden people in everyday life. What is behind the wooden veneer? I think that a good actor takes the roles that work best for them. Look at Peck's performance as Lewt in DUEL IN THE SUN. That is not one of Peck's typical performances. I wonder after all these years what Peck's critique would be to his performance in that film. If you do watch THE BIG COUNTRY I think that Peck actually makes very subtle references to his performance in DUEL IN THE SUN with his awkward attempt at humor, which is consistent with the character of James McKay. THE BIG COUNTRY is one of America's greatest films. It is blessed with one of the finest scores ever written for an American film. What composer Jerome Moross gave us was true Americana as well as music in the Western genre. This score captures the spirit of what made America great. America is made up of different people and different ideals. Charlton Heston as Steve Leech, in what I think was also his best role and performance, showed us an overly assertive male quality. When he finally confronts McKay he comes away with a self-realization about his own motivations and what being a man really means. Later when put to the test he is truly torn for the first time between good sense and loyalty to the selfish and tyrannical Maj. Henry Terrill (Charles Bickford). Only the viewer can draw a conclusion on his actions. The pivotal music by Jerome Moross in this scene will tear your emotions apart. Burl Ives as Rufus Hannassey won an Academy Award for his role. For me he was the most enigmatic character in this film. Is he as tyrannical as his nemesis Henry Terrill is or not? I am still perplexed. Another good performance in this film was by Chuck Connors as the tragic Buck Hannassey. Chuck Connors as an actor deserved infinitely more recognition than he ever got and this film proves it. This was not a film of black and white characterizations. There was a lot of gray. I saw this film in the theatre when I was a little kid when it first got released. It is very strong on imagery. My heart went out to Chuck Connors as Buck Hannassey in the finale and it still does when I watch it today. This is one of my ten or so favorite films. It is slow and deliberate. It is not flashy. The critics at the time were very wrong. It is a long movie yet there is not a wasted shot in it. It packs a greater emotional punch every time I watch it. The older you get, the more you can identify with it. I was lucky enough to see it the first time when I was very young. This is one of those rare films that offers something knew each time you watch it.",5,ONE OF GREGORY PECKs MOST NOBLE PERFORMANCES,1055462400,"06 13, 2003",2003,3223,"['think', 'Peck', 'best', 'performance', 'was', '1958s', 'THE', 'BIG', 'COUNTRY', 'THE', 'BIG', 'COUNTRY', 'based', 'Donald', 'Hamilton', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'central', 'character', 'named', 'James', 'McKay', 'McKay', 'was', 'sea', 'captain', 'who', 'looked', 'acted', 'something', 'dandy', 'relocated', 'out', 'west', 'back', 'east', 'marry', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'McKay', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'nothing', 'prove', 'anyone', 'read', 'novel', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'James', 'McKay', 'Peck', 'chose', 'project', 'co-produced', 'think', 'recognized', 'particular', 'character', 'novel', 'mirrored', 'approach', 'many', 'roles', 'chose', 'are', 'wooden', 'people', 'everyday', 'life', 'What', 'wooden', 'veneer', 'think', 'good', 'actor', 'roles', 'work', 'best', 'Look', 'Peck', 'performance', 'Lewt', 'DUEL', 'IN', 'THE', 'SUN', 'not', 'one', 'Peck', 'typical', 'performances', 'wonder', 'years', 'what', 'Peck', 'critique', 'would', 'be', 'performance', 'film', 'do', 'watch', 'THE', 'BIG', 'COUNTRY', 'think', 'Peck', 'actually', 'very', 'subtle', 'references', 'performance', 'DUEL', 'IN', 'THE', 'SUN', 'awkward', 'attempt', 'humor', 'consistent', 'character', 'James', 'McKay', 'THE', 'BIG', 'COUNTRY', 'one', 'America', 'greatest', 'films', 'blessed', 'one', 'finest', 'scores', 'ever', 'written', 'American', 'film', 'What', 'composer', 'Jerome', 'Moross', 'gave', 'was', 'true', 'Americana', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'Western', 'genre', 'score', 'spirit', 'what', 'made', 'America', 'great', 'America', 'made', 'different', 'people', 'different', 'ideals', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Steve', 'Leech', 'what', 'think', 'was', 'also', 'best', 'role', 'performance', 'showed', 'overly', 'assertive', 'male', 'quality', 'When', 'finally', 'McKay', 'away', 'self-realization', 'own', 'motivations', 'what', 'being', 'man', 'really', 'Later', 'when', 'put', 'test', 'truly', 'torn', 'first', 'time', 'good', 'sense', 'loyalty', 'selfish', 'tyrannical', 'Maj.', 'Henry', 'Terrill', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'Only', 'viewer', 'can', 'draw', 'conclusion', 'actions', 'pivotal', 'music', 'Jerome', 'Moross', 'scene', 'will', 'tear', 'emotions', 'apart', 'Burl', 'Rufus', 'Hannassey', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'role', 'was', 'most', 'enigmatic', 'character', 'film', 'as', 'tyrannical', 'nemesis', 'Henry', 'Terrill', 'not', 'am', 'still', 'perplexed', 'good', 'performance', 'film', 'was', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'tragic', 'Buck', 'Hannassey', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'actor', 'deserved', 'infinitely', 'more', 'recognition', 'ever', 'got', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'black', 'white', 'characterizations', 'was', 'lot', 'gray', 'saw', 'film', 'theatre', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'when', 'first', 'got', 'released', 'very', 'strong', 'imagery', 'My', 'heart', 'went', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'Buck', 'Hannassey', 'finale', 'still', 'when', 'watch', 'today', 'one', 'ten', 'so', 'favorite', 'films', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'not', 'flashy', 'critics', 'time', 'were', 'very', 'wrong', 'long', 'movie', 'yet', 'not', 'wasted', 'shot', 'greater', 'emotional', 'punch', 'time', 'watch', 'older', 'get', 'more', 'can', 'identify', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'see', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'something', 'knew', 'time', 'watch']",N/A
152676,A2MRRDJSDVOCUM,079284517X,Grant,"[2, 2]","THE BIG COUNTRY (1958) Starring Gregory Peck, Charlton Heston, Jean Simmons, Carol Baker, Burl Ives, Charles Bickford and Chuck Connors.Well, let me start by saying that this is one of my favorite films of all time and not just in the western category.  It's a movie that transcends the confines of its own genre.  From the moment the movie starts...with that amazing Jerome Moross score, you know you're in for something special.  The music in this film is, for me at least, one of the main characters.  The first shot...of the stage coach riding across the huge expanse of this ""Big Country"" carries us through the credits with shots of a spinning wagon wheel super imposed on scenes of a vast frontier accompanied by a rousing musical score.The stagecoach arrives at its destination with James McKay (Gregory Peck) in tow from the east...a former navy man and retired ships captain whose family owns a shipping line.  The film quickly establishes him as the quintessential ""fish out of water"" with his eastern clothes and bowler hat that is quickly made fun of by the locals.  Peck has come to marry Carol Baker...a pretty, headstrong blonde that Peck met when she visited the east coast.  Peck is met at the station by Charlton Heston as Steve Leech, foreman of the ranch that belongs to Bakers father, Henry Terrill aka ""The Major"" played by Charles Bickford.  Heston takes an instant dislike to Peck as he is also in love with Baker.  Peck and Baker are reunited at the house of Bakers best friend Jean Simmons.Soon, Baker and Peck are off to Bickfords ranch...a giant expanse of land which he owns almost as far as the eye can see.  On the way to the ranch, Peck and Baker are harassed by members of the ""Hannassey"" family.  The Hannassey's are a more scruffy and financially humble family with an empire of their own hidden away behind the bleached stone cliffs of ""Blanco Canyon"" and led by Hannassey family patriarch Burl Ives.  Connors playes Ives oldest son.  Connors and his brothers subject Peck to a little hazing which Peck takes rather good naturedly.  Baker however is outraged and pulls out a shot gun to shoot at the drunken ruffians.  Peck stops her and the situation is soon diffused.  But Peck is somewhat surprised by Bakers extreme reaction of hate.  Soon they are at Bakers home..Ladder Ranch.Peck soon meets Major Terrill, a hard man who is drawn to Pecks ""gentlemanly forbearance"".  Peck gives the Major his fathers old dueling pistols as a gift.  Here we see glimpses of the origins of Pecks peaceful demeanor.  His father was killed in a duel.  Peck tells Bickford how ""nobody knows what that last duel was even about"".  Bickford warns Peck that here in the west a man is still expected to defend himself.  Peck soon discovers to his dismay the extent of this feud between the Terrills and the Hannasseys when he sees that the Major and Heston are taking a group of men to beat the tar out of the drunken brothers.  Heston asks Peck to come along for a little revenge but Peck wants no part of it.Later, at Peck and Bakers engagement party we find out more about this feud.  It seems that Jean Simmons is the sole owner of her family's ranch the ""Big Muddy"".  It is the main source of water for cattle for both the Terrills and the Hannasseys.  She lets both families use all the water they want, but both are constantly trying to get her to sell her land to them so that each man might use it to cut off the others water supply for their cattle, effectively destroying their enemies' respective empires.  Over the course of the film, Peck becomes even more deeply embroiled in the feud as he takes more proactive steps to prevent violence and bloodshed.  But try as he might...he soon discovers that in this ""Big Country"" bloodshed is inevitable.Of course we know that there will be a confrontation between Peck and Heston.  But it isn't like any traditional ""western brawl"" that we have seen before.  It's not just a fight over a girl, or for honor.  The fight is more symbolic than anything.  Especially given Pecks line after it's all over.  As the two men stand, totally alone, bruised and bloody, Peck puts the whole thing into perfect perspective when he asks Heston...""So tell me...what did we prove?""This simple line speaks volumes about the senselessness of violence and reminds one of films such as Clint Eastwoods ""Unforgiven"".The finale is nothing less than spectacular.  Suspenseful and exciting confrontations all around and not at all in the way you might expect from a more traditional western from the period.I think the films biggest problem is the actual print.  On the DVD of the film, while some scenes are crisp and clear and beautiful, others seem fuzzy with washed out color.  There are moments where it seems there are frames missing and we see quick split second jumps.  It definitely needs some more restoration I feel.  The sound is excellent.  The film runs at just about 2 hrs and 45 minutes.  I've heard critics say they felt it was too long, but I disagree.  There is a specific pacing to this film that has a natural flow to it.  There are no rushed scenes and then long boring scenes.  Scenes gradually play out and build to a crescendo...sometimes fooling us, and then rewarding us with surprises we didn't see coming.  Wyler films it with a wonderful consistency.  It must also be said that it is imperative that this is watched in its original aspect ratio.  The pan and scan version on VHS ruins several scenes in my opinion.  In particular a scene between Baker, Peck and Heston at breakfast and later a scene between Peck and Simmons.  And then at the end, during the major confrontations and battles.  All these scenes need to be seen in wide screen.I enjoy all the characters.  Baker does get slightly grating near the end.  She has a great scene where she slaps Heston with her riding crop.  Heston grabs her wrists and pulls her to him and kisses her roughly.  She bits his lip and draws blood.  In the after math of the incident between them...she tries to fix her mussed hair and starts to tremble and throws a major breakdown.  Nice scene.  Simmons doesn't really have a lot of scenes but they are integral and there is an attempted rape scene that is very intense and she is very good in it.  It's easy to see how Ives won the best supporting actor Oscar here, he is great.  And I don't think I need to go on anymore about the Oscar nominated score.  It's brilliant and emotional and exciting and a crucial part of this films success.This is one of those films in which I love the story and the characters so much that I want to know more.  I want to see a prequel and find out the source of this decades long hate between Ives and Bickford.  Likewise, I want to see these characters lives in the aftermath of the films events.  I've never read the Donald Hamilton book that the film is based on, but I want to just to see if there is more to this story.  This western breaks a lot of traditional clich&eacute;s in Pecks character.  He tries to avoid fighting and pulls off not looking cowardly, but trying to reason, to negotiate.  Peck tries to bring peace, but still finds himself having to fight, albeit reluctantly.  He doesn't need to prove anything to anyone but himself.  We gradually see that he is a force for peace, with the strength to maintain that peace.The film seems to spiral around all these characters, going around the edges and slowly finding the center of what everyone is about.  They are epic characters, but their pettiness is made small with long distance camera shots that make them seem tiny and inconsequential.  But the more the film starts to bring them into tighter focus, we see their faults.  We see characters that seem weak who turn out to be the sources of true strength and character.  Characters that seem like simple stooges...one dimensional tools of the two, more complex, warring old men.  But as the film probes deeper, we see a reversal of all this.  The seemingly complex patriarchs are simplistic symbols of hate, while the followers, like Heston...start to change and see the wrongness of their leader's actions.  The characters could be considered symbols...they parallel the actions of nations in a way.  I think this film has a wonderful message about character, force, peace and strength used both wisely and foolishly.  Minor problems with the print aside...this is still a 5 star film from beginning to end.",5,The Big Country transcends the confines of its own genre,1255737600,"10 17, 2009",2009,8440,"['BIG',

It covers quite a bit of &#34;country&#34;, and makes use of some character studies which give you a little more feeling about just what is going on.  Burl Ives is super, and shows his stuff in this one.  Gregory Peck is stoic, and polite, but underneath all that he is a real man, without fear, and it takes awhile for that to be evident.  Charlton Heston is, of course, perfect in the part, and it seems made for him.  The plot is familiar, but in the context of the movie, and the location filmed, very believable.  Chuck Conners plays a somewhat cowardly son of Burl Ives, and tends to be a bully, when he has help around, but gives a solid performance as the son Ives ended up with, even though he is a disappointment, Ives still displays a tough fatherly affection toward him.  I got to meet Chuck Conners once, in about 1978, he was in a parade in Reno, Nevada.  I talked with him, and even got to &#34;handle&#34; his rifle (the one he used in the &#34;Rifleman&#34; series from TV).  I must say he was very nice, friendly, and very talented.

152684,AYA9ZUS9Z0BVW,079284517X,"Jane Pensive ""a film fan""","[3, 3]","According to his biographer, director William Wyler was returnng to his film roots by directing a western. He spent his early days in film directing westerns for his cousin Carl Laemmle. Here Wyler does what he does best: direct actors in amazing performances, and tell an interesting story in sweeping visual terms. The film's score greatly aids the artistic appeal of the film.Leading man Gregory Peck is a little old for his initial love  interest Carol Baker (she looks like his daughter in some sequences), but  he does just fine matched against leading lady Jean Simmons. Peck can be a somewhat wooden actor, but he is at his best as in a part like this one where he plays the strong silent hero who bucks expectations (think Atticus Finch in ""To Kill a Mockingbird""). Peck refuses to accept his fiancee's and her father's plans for him to join the well-heeled ranchers and drive the messy Hennesseys out of the country for good. Peck just wants everyone to get along. That probably is not going to work out well in a western. Charles Bickford is terrific as one of the patriarchs of one of the feuding clans. He manages to convey the fact that he is a violent, ruthless man underneath a veneer of refinement. The other feuding clan is headed by folk-singer Burl Ives who chews all of the scenery and makes a huge impact as Rufus Hennessey, who has no  intention of letting anyone get in the  way of his cattle. Other roles which are well executed feature Charlton Heston as a smoldering, jealous, incredibly sexy ranch foreman and Chuck Connors as a repulsive rapist. I found Jean Simmons to give a workmanlike performance as the school teacher at  the center of the drama, although she told Wyler's biographer that she did not like Wyler, and the film was almost impossible to act in because of constant script changes.The characterizations are the key element of the appeal of the film, and reveal the fact that Wyler is behind the scenes pulling all of the strings, even if we didn't see his name in the credits. Although he thought the film was one of his lesser efforts, I think most viewers will find the movie  to be exceptional, even with a comparison to the great John Ford's  films. When one realizes the chaos Wyler had to  deal with behind the scenes (unhappy leads Peck and Simmons, cantankerous Bickford, and inexperienced actors in important parts) the final result is a triumph.",4,Wyler Returns to His Roots,1279065600,"07 14, 2010",2010,2401,"['According', 'biographer', 'director', 'William', 'Wyler', 'was', 'returnng', 'film', 'roots', 'directing', 'western', 'spent', 'early', 'days', 'film', 'directing', 'westerns', 'cousin', 'Carl', 'Laemmle', 'Here', 'Wyler', 'what', 'best', 'direct', 'actors', 'amazing', 'performances', 'tell', 'interesting', 'story', 'sweeping', 'visual', 'terms', 'film', 'score', 'greatly', 'artistic', 'appeal', 'film.Leading', 'man', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'little', 'old', 'initial', 'love', 'interest', 'Carol', 'Baker', 'daughter', 'sequences', 'just', 'fine', 'matched', 'leading', 'lady', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'Peck', 'can', 'be', 'somewhat', 'wooden', 'actor', 'best', 'part', 'one', 'where', 'strong', 'silent', 'hero', 'who', 'expectations', 'think', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'Peck', 'accept', 'fiancee', 'father', 'plans', 'join', 'well-heeled', 'ranchers', 'drive', 'messy', 'Hennesseys', 'country', 'good', 'Peck', 'just', 'everyone', 'get', 'along', 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'work', 'out', 'well', 'western', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'terrific', 'one', 'patriarchs', 'one', 'feuding', 'clans', 'convey', 'fact', 'violent', 'ruthless', 'man', 'veneer', 'refinement', 'other', 'feuding', 'clan', 'headed', 'folk-singer', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'who', 'chews', 'scenery', 'huge', 'impact', 'Rufus', 'Hennessey', 'who', 'intention', 'letting', 'anyone', 'get', 'way', 'cattle', 'Other', 'roles', 'are', 'well', 'executed', 'feature', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'smoldering', 'jealous', 'incredibly', 'sexy', 'ranch', 'foreman', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'repulsive', 'rapist', 'found', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'give', 'workmanlike', 'performance', 'school', 'teacher', 'center', 'drama', 'told', 'Wyler', 'biographer', 'did', 'not', 'Wyler', 'film', 'was', 'almost', 'impossible', 'act', 'constant', 'script', 'changes.The', 'characterizations', 'are', 'key', 'element', 'appeal', 'film', 'reveal', 'fact', 'Wyler', 'scenes', 'pulling', 'strings', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'name', 'credits', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'lesser', 'efforts', 'think', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'be', 'exceptional', 'even', 'comparison', 'great', 'John', 'Ford', 'films', 'When', 'one', 'chaos', 'Wyler', 'had', 'deal', 'scenes', 'unhappy', 'Peck', 'Simmons', 'cantankerous', 'Bickford', 'inexperienced', 'actors', 'important', 'parts', 'final', 'result', 'triumph']",N/A

But a funny thing happens on the way to the alter.  Actually the way to the alter is a bit of a misnomer as other than a grand ball for the betrothed couple, there is surprisingly little reference to any pending wedding.  Instead, we see exactly how mismatched this couple truly is.  Jim McKean (Gregory Peck) is unfazed by anything around him.  He plays his role of the ship captain away from the sea perfectly.  The local bullies try to humiliate him, the bucking bronco tries to throw him, the future father-in-law tries to bully him, and his fiance tries to make her into a younger version of her father, but Jim navigates these waters as if still aboard his ship.  Instead of allowing these external influences to change him, Jim charts his own course.  He stays behind during a failed raid by his future father-in-law's thugs, he buys the coveted ranch with the best local water supply, he refuses to accept the phoniness of his girl as she attempts to win him back.

152695,A25E44CFFC4B7T,079284517X,John R. Linnell,"[1, 1]","I enjoy a good Western. My three all time favorites are Silverado, The Professionals and The Big Country. Those are simply great.The set up of The Big Country is a classic. Two battling landowning families, water rights, a man from the East (James MacKay played by Gregory Peck) coming to marry the daughter of the largest landowner, Major Henry Terrill, (played by Charles Bickford) whose ranch foreman, Steve Leech, (played by Charleton Heston) has eyes and hopes for also. The prize to be won is control of The Big Muddy, a stretch of river that is used by both Terrill and his counterpart Rufus Hannessey (played by Burl Ives) when the usual watering areas start to go dry.The land through which the Big Muddy flows is owned by Julie Maragon (played by Jean Simmons) who inherited it from her father who was a revered gentlemen who gave watering rights to all who needed them. Julie has continued the tradition, however Terrill in an effort to provoke a confromtation with the Hanesseys has driven their cattle wawy from the river.MacKay, a retied sea captain, although quite young to have been retired arrives to meet his fiance's family, he having met her while she attended school in the East. It isn't long before he finds himself in the middle of the feuding families activities. On the ride out to the ranch, Mackay and his fiancee, Pat Terrill (Carol Baker) are intercepted and Mackay is roughed up in a hazing type of fashion by Buck Hannessey and three of his ranch hands. The Major goes looking for Buck and in the process manages to invade and shoot up the Hannessey compound while Rufus is away and beat up the three ranch hands where he finds them in town while Buck is cowering in a buckboard, undiscovered.As one might imagine, Rufus does not take kindly to that and shows up in the middle of a large welcoming party for Mackay to tell the Major what he thinks of it his face. It is a classic scene and one of several that propelled Ives to the Academy Award that year.It is one that also gets MacKay wondering about what kind of family he is marrying into. A series of events where MacKay refuses to be provoked into fighting or otherwise ""showing his manhood"" in the eyes of Pat Terrill, lead to harsh words between them and Mackay leaves the ranch, however before doing so, he goes to Leeche's bunkhouse to advise he is leaving and that he has come to say ""goodbye."" What follows is a classic fight between the two of them which is at best a draw and Leech gains a new respect for ""the dude"" while with both of them lying in the dust, winded and bloodied, Leech looks at his adversary and says, ""You sure take a long time to say goodbye.""Unbeknown to his finacee, Mackay has done a survey of the Maragon land on his own and has gotten Julie Maragon to agree to sell the land to him as a wedding present with his promise that all who have need of its waters shall have them.Maragon tells Pat of this after she finds out that the couple have parted and she is also instrumental in showing her that Mackay has his own manly way of doing things. Terrill rides into town to apologize and in the process of doing so makes matters far worse so that the rift between them is permanent.After having his cattle run off of the Big Muddy, Rufus dispatches Buck to bring Julie Maragon to him, willingly or unwillingly. Buck has been feeding his father full of the line that Julie is ""sweet on him."" The confrontation between Rufus, Julie and Buck is another classic scene in which Julie disabuses Rufus of any notion that she has any interest in Buck and reveals that she no longer owns the land on The Big Muddy.Major Terrill is told that Julie has been kidnapped and predictably organizes a rescue party to invade the Hanassey compound in Blanco Canyon which is just what Rufus wants as he has set up the mother of all ambushes to await the Terrill rescue efort which he tells Julie will make ""Henry Terrill the most surprised dead man you ever saw.""MacKay also gets wind of the kidnapping and rides in alone to try and persuade Rufus to release her and demonstrates that he owns the land and promises that Hannesey will always have access to the water. He and Buck get into a confrontation that leads to one of the most dramtic parts of the movie, but before that, MacKay also tells Rufus that this is not about all them men that will die in the Blanco Canyon massacre that awaits. It is about Rufus and the Major, two selfish and pathetic old men.Following the confronmtation with Buck, Makay and Julie are allowed to leave and as that happens the Terrill men are riding into a death trap which is sprung and the shooting starts.Hanassey has gotten the message and rides to the area and tells his men to ""Keep them covered, but hold your fire,"" after which he calls out Major Terrill and says this is about the two of them and they should resolve it. They do and the rest is history.The scenery, the music and the acting in this movie are subperb, but the enduring memory one takes from this is the character of Rufus Hanessey, Burl Ives got the role because he was a poker buddy of Gregory Peck and Peck instinctively knew that this was the man for the job. One cannot imagine anyone else in that role.This movie was made the same year that Ives also played Big Daddy in Cat in a Hot Tin Roof, yet it was the role of Rufus which brought him the Oscar.It also brought all of us a memorable movie. If you love Westerns, you need to own this one.",5,A Classic to be Revisited From Time to Time,1192320000,"10 14, 2007",2007,5457,"['enjoy', 'good', 'Western', 'three', 'time', 'favorites', 'are',

Party GuestIt is said that Gregory Peck and William Wyler, erstwhile friends who had previously worked together successfully had a falling out over this film and never spoke for years afterward.  Both were co-producers, and Peck became agitated over the fact that Wylie was working too slowly and the film was going 'way over budget.  Wylie resented anyone else telling him how to make a movie.  It also appears that three of Peck's children had children's parts in the film.The fight seen between Peck and Heston is one of the high points of the film that has caused much comment, as it was filmed from a great distance, rather than close-uo.Such details aside, the story depicts a sea-captain, James McKay (Peck) coming West to marry Patricia Terrill (Carol Baker).  He walks straight into a personal vendetta between Major Henry Terrill (Charles Bickford) and Rufus Hannassey (Burl Ives) over an old grudge, and the usual battle over water rights typical in many Western stories.  McKay is a peaceful man who tends to avoid resorting to violence, causing his would-be bride to accuse him of cowardice.Buck Hannassey (Chuck Connors) and Steve Leech (Charlton Heston) play supporting roles, each of whom has designs on the leading women in the story, leading to antagonisms.  Ramon (Alphonso Bedoya) plays his part well, as a Mexican ranch employee.  He was better in the Treasure of the Sierra Madre, I think, but he always turns in a good performance.This is a good Western, with the usual scenery typical of the West.

152702,A356QJWDT3P62R,079284517X,Keoma,"[6, 9]","There are some movies that I just never grow tired of watching. ""The Big Country"" is certainly one of those along with say, ""The Searchers"" that fits into this category. What makes a great movie or TV series or novel? I believe it is the characters in the story that makes a compelling story. ""The Big Country"" is no exception. Everyone in this movie has a choice part and each character is a lead character right on down to the big open country itself. Deftly handled by director William Wyler it is one in a long line of MGM's movie gems. The pristine blu-ray brings out all the subtle coloration's and picture detail previously unavailable even on the 1080I presentations from satellite broadcasts. For instance, you notice all the different hues of ""Blanco"" canyon at the final shootout sequence, and especially the white washed-out sandstone walls which is so symbolic of the emptiness and hatred of the two protagonists ranchers as they ""go at it"". This is also symbolized throughout the movie with the mostly dead-brown grass of the prairie and then at the end when the real victors ride into a now green vista. There is also the pre-dawn fight sequence between Charlton Heston and Gregory Peck. Obviously shot day-for-night the color was never right especially on the old pan and scan presentations on the late show night viewings but now can be scene color corrected and effectively simulating pre-dawn light.This oater boasts some of the greatest in Hollywood legends. Everyone talks about Lee Van Cleef having the fiercest and meanest eyes but I have to disagree and say that Chuck Conners is the winner in this category. When he squints those cold hard eyes at you it makes one swaller their chewing tobacco (LOL!). Although in this movie there is cowardice behind that fierce facade who can forget ""that look"" in The Rifleman TV series. Chilling! Then there's Carroll Baker who's character seems  sweet and gentle but who is influenced by her father's (Charles Bickford)hatred for rival rancher Burl Ives (who gives a performance worthy of an academy award). Jean Simmons, who is always a pleasure to watch, brings beauty and dignity to the screen again as someone who will do almost anything to stop the jealous madness between the two rivals. Then there is the main character played by Gregory Peck a former sea captain who trades the wide open spaces of the oceans for the wide open spaces of the American prairie who also wants to intercede as he is initially in a romance with Carroll Bakers character who spurns him later. Charlton Heston turns in a fine performance as ""Steve"" the ranch foreman who becomes jealous as he has his eyes set on her(Carroll Baker) also. I can't tell much more as I don't want to give away the entire story but this is certainly one movie that will remain a classic and has gotten the treatment it deserves on blu-ray. I have one complaint and that is the extras. On this copy that I picked up the extras cannot be gotten into as every time I click on them with the remote the disc will stop playing and yes I am hitting the right button.

The DVD version is a very poor copy of the original film.  There are scratch marks, flashing lights, and the evidence of a very dirty negative used to transfer this classic movie to DVD.  An injustice was done in using a damaged used print to make this DVD.  I have not seen the Blu-Ray version, but it has to be better than this.  My old VHS version was better than the DVD version.  Buyer Beware!Gregory Peck heads up this all-star cast that also includes Charlton Heston, Jean Simmons, Carol Baker, Chuck Connors, and Burl Ives.  The movie has an epic feel to it, yet this is an atypical, almost pacifistic western in that the hero (Peck) has a very unorthodox way of living his life. A self-assured man, who lives life to his drumbeat, McKay (Peck) purchases a vital piece of land (The Big Muddy) with a  water supply that two ranch families (the socially refined Terrills and the unrefined Hannassays) desperately need to water their cattle.  The land is meant to be a wedding present for Major Terrill's strong-willed daughter, Pat.  But when Jim McKay's unorthodox ways do not measure up to what Pat Terrill's measure of a man should be, Pat and Jim McKay call off their engagement, and McKay must try to keep the peace between the two families who are about to to to war over their water rights.  When Julie Maragon (Jean Simmons) is kidnapped by the Hannasseys in an attempt to get the Big Muddy water rights, McKay must summon all his courage and grit, (qualities that Pat Terrill questions in Jim McKay) and rescue Julie and prevent the slaughter of men from both sides.  The climatic ending is worth the 165 minutes that lead up to it.Directed by Academy Award winner William Wyler, Wyler incorporates the movie's title (BIG Country) into every sweeping visual panorama throughout the entire film.  Although some critics consider the movie to be slow paced, (and those who are looking for the traditional western shoot-em-up will be disappointed) I truly enjoyed the pace of this movie, for it is reflected as well in the character of Jim McKay, a thoughtful, careful man who lives life on his terms.This film is suitable for the entire family.kone",5,Epic Western with All-Star Cast,1362182400,"03 2, 2013",2013,2296,"['potential', 'buyer', 'DVD', 'strongly', 'advise', 'NOT', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'version', 'instead', 'get', 'Blu-Ray', 'edition', 'instead', 'DVD', 'version', 'very', 'poor', 'copy', 'original', 'film', 'are', 'scratch', 'marks', 'flashing', 'lights', 'evidence', 'very', 'dirty', 'negative', 'used', 'transfer', 'classic', 'movie', 'DVD', 'injustice', 'was', 'done', 'using', 'damaged', 'used', 'print', 'make', 'DVD', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Blu-Ray', 'version', 'be', 'better', 'old', 'VHS', 'version', 'was', 'better', 'DVD', 'version', 'Buyer', 'Beware', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'up', 'all-star', 'cast', 'also', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'Carol', 'Baker', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'movie', 'epic', 'feel', 'yet', 'atypical', 'almost', 'pacifistic', 'western', 'hero', 'Peck', 'very', 'unorthodox', 'way', 'living', 'life', 'self-assured', 'man', 'who', 'life', 'drumbeat', 'McKay', 'Peck', 'purchases', 'vital', 'piece', 'land', 'Big', 'Muddy', 'water', 'supply', 'two', 'ranch', 'families', 'socially', 'refined', 'Terrills', 'unrefined', 'Hannassays', 'desperately', 'need', 'water', 'cattle', 'land', 'meant', 'be', 'wedding', 'present', 'Major', 'Terrill', 'strong-willed', 'daughter', 'Pat', 'when', 'Jim', 'McKay', 'unorthodox', 'ways', 'do', 'not', 'measure', 'up', 'what', 'Pat', 'Terrill', 'measure', 'man', 'should', 'be', 'Pat', 'Jim', 'McKay', 'call', 'off', 'engagement', 'McKay', 'must', 'try', 'keep', 'peace', 'two', 'families', 'who', 'are', 'war', 'water', 'rights', 'When', 'Julie', 'Maragon', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'kidnapped', 'Hannasseys', 'attempt', 'get', 'Big', 'Muddy', 'water', 'rights', 'McKay', 'must', 'summon', 'courage', 'grit', 'qualities', 'Pat', 'Terrill', 'questions', 'Jim', 'McKay', 'rescue', 'Julie', 'prevent', 'slaughter', 'men', 'sides', 'climatic', 'ending', '165', 'minutes', 'lead', 'up', 'it.Directed', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'William', 'Wyler', 'Wyler', 'movie', 'title', 'BIG', 'Country', 'sweeping', 'visual', 'panorama', 'entire', 'film', 'critics', 'consider', 'movie', 'be', 'slow', 'paced', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'traditional', 'western', 'shoot-em-up', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'pace', 'movie', 'reflected', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'Jim', 'McKay', 'thoughtful', 'careful', 'man', 'who', 'life', 'terms.This', 'film', 'suitable', 'entire', 'family.kone']",N/A
152705,A20SO3O9ODU8KF,079284517X,"Laurence G. Cripe ""ScriptMaverick""","[1, 1]","Few westerns capture the eye and the imagination as does this majestic, cinematic opera.  Bringing together the grand acting talents of Gregory Peck, Jean Simmons, Burl Ives, Carroll Baker, Charlton Heston, Charles Bickford, Chuck Connors, and Alfonso Bedoya was truly ""big""; however, matching them against a magnificent backdrop that cleverly captures the endless expanse of the American frontier - hence the name - was sheer genius.  With a splendid score by Jerome Moross that stands the test of time and may be the best western motion picture score ever composed (possibly a dead heat with Elmer Bernstein's 'The Magnificient Seven'), 'The Big Country', for some strange reason, has never seemed to get its due reward.The story captures a classic struggle between two land barons, ably portrayed by Charles Bickford as Major Henry Terrill, a cultured socialite, who runs the Ladder Ranch and his nemesis,Rufus Hannessey (Burl Ives) - the patriach of a clan of western, knuckle-dragging troglodytes who occupy a ranch beyond Blanco Canyon.  While the dichotomy is rich, the portrayal by Burl Ives is nothing less than cinematic poetry - it just doesn't get better than this!  The speech delivered by Hannessey (Ives) at the grand ball where Terrill (Bickford) announces the upcoming marriage between his daughter, Patricia (Carroll Baker), and her betrothed, Jim McKay (Gregory Peck), is very powerful and sets the tone for the conflict. In a battle over water rights and access to the ""Big Muddy"" - essential to both ranchers and their cattle, many characters and conflicts are enhanced.The skill in character development is handled with such finesse, that despite the conflict, the audience finds qualities on both sides and is eager to root for Jim McKay (Peck) when he finally decides that the woman he met back East many years ago is not the woman he wants to marry.  (Carroll Baker) plays a perfect ""snot"" who decides that McKay doesn't quite stand-up to the test of manhood that her father (Bickford) sets.  Instead, McKay falls for beautiful Julie Maragon (Jean Simmons)and decides to use the property he purchased from her - containing the ""Big Muddy"" - to allow both feuding ranchers to partake in quenching the thirst of their cattle.Look for Alfonso Bedoya, magnificent character actor, as a Terrill ranch hand - formerly ""Gold Hat"" (""we don't need no stinkin' badges"") in ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"".  Also, Chuck Connors, who would shortly play TV's 'The Rifleman', plays Buck Hannessey with a terrificly solid portrayal as he attempts to woo Julie Maragon (Simmons) before McKay wins her over. Charlton Heston is relegated to the ""back seat"" as Terrill's ranch foreman who greatly dislikes McKay and believes that McKay doesn't deserve Patricia Terrill (Baker).Filmed in multiple Arizona, New Mexico, and California locations - including, but not limited to - Canyon de Chelly, Chinle, Red Rock Canyon, Stockton, and Marysville, ""The Big Country"" is and remains a western classic.

152712,AIQ15562S4FQG,079284517X,L.M.W.,"[0, 0]","Although my tastes in film are very broad, I am not fond of Westerns. However, ""The Big Country"" is an excellent film. It is a Western, but in many ways it doesn't FEEL like a Western. The film's intelligence, strong characters, and reliance on humanity provide a superior storyline to the traditional shoot-`em-up mentality so common in Westerns.The basic premise concerns retired sea captain James McKay (Peck), who travels West to marry his fianc&eacute; Pat Terrill (Baker), whom he met while she was visiting Baltimore. He is quickly thrown in the middle of a huge family feud between the wealthy Terrills and the struggling Hannasseys, presumably over water rights at the Big Muddy, a dormant ranch owned by the lovely schoolteacher Julie (Simmons). However, McKay, the intelligent outsider, sees through the feuding patriarchs (Bickford and Ives). What follows is, in my opinion, one of the most effective showdowns in Western cinema (forget ""High Noon"").The characterization in this film is particularly strong. Gregory Peck is very good, as always, even though his McKay character has a level of integrity that may be just a BIT hard to swallow. Carroll Baker's role as the spoiled only child is sickeningly good. Jean Simmons is sweet and demure, but strong and self-sufficient, a perfect contrast to her friend, Pat. Charles Bickford's egotistical role as Major Henry Terrill is great, and his questionable relationship with his daughter raised my eyebrows. Charlton Heston's role is relatively small, but he provides the necessary tension and jealousy between himself, Baker, and Peck. In addition, his character's loyalty to Terrill, although misplaced, is touching. Chuck Connors' character as Buck Hannassey is vile, trashy, and degrading, but his performance is one of the most credible in the film. And, saving the best for last, Burl Ives is absolutely superb in the role of Rufus Hannassey, the overweight, bullying patriarch who simultaneously loves and hates his son Buck. He deserved the Best Supporting Actor Oscar that he won for this role.There is one flaw to this film that stands out, and another reviewer mentioned it below: watch the canyon barricade scene near the end.

152713,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,079284517X,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1, 1]","This is a great classic western, dealing with things not usually associated with those films - non-violence and pacifism. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.Wealthy, cultured and still young, but already quite experienced New England sea captain James McKay (Gregory Peck) gets engaged to Patricia Terrill (Carroll Baker), daughter of a very rich cattle baron, Major Henry Terrill (Charles Bickford). As his future wife desires to live in the West rather on the coast, he retires and follows her to her father's large domain. There however he learns about some things he completely ignored, the most important of which is the deadly feud existing since a long time between Major Terrill and Rufus Hannassey (Burl Ives), the tyrannical patriarch of a poorer ranching clan. He also realises that there is history between Steve Leech (Charlton Heston), Terrill's foreman and Patricia... And then, last but not least, he discovers the existence of Julie Maragon (Jean Simmons), Patricia's best friend, who works as schoolteacher but also owns the ""Big Muddy"", a ranch with a vital water supply situated exactly between territories of both feuding clans... All that is just the beginning of this 160 minutes long film.The core element of the film is the cultural shock and even confrontation between McKay, who is very reluctant to engage in violence, even verbal and almost everybody else beginning with Patricia, who are used to tougher ways of the West. In fact quite quickly McKay starts to be considered as a whimp and coward by most of people, including even his fianc&eacute;e... In fact, he is neither - he actually can hit very hard when he really wants it - but for some reason he willingly enters the game, hides his tougher side and even on purpose reinforces the general negative impression about him.I must say that even if I always liked this film a lot, the character of McKay, well, I am really of two minds about him. On one side I can understand that he is willing to let other people assume the worst about him to check exactly how strong is the love of future wife for him - will she stand by him to the end through thick and thin, even if he disappoints her, or will she not? On another hand, this game he plays with his fianc&eacute;e is a cruel and mean one - and I had the impression that his meeting with Julie Maragon and Steve Leech immediately after arriving to town, was the REAL actual reason why he started to play this game at all... James McKay is clearly an equivocal character, not so much an angel as one could believe in the beginning...The subject of pacifism and non-violent resolution of conflicts was actually more frequently treated in westerns than one could expect. ""High Noon"" certainly included strong such accents, as did ""Angel and the Bad Man"", ""Friendly Persuasion"" and ""Shenandoah"" - but it is in ""Big Country"" that the condemnation of violence as way of solving problems is the strongest. In fact, at the very end of the film I had the impression that the message was pressed into publics throat even maybe just TOO forcibly...I must also say that the main bad guy in this film, Buck Hannassey (Chuck Connors), is clearly a caricature. The writer and the director put into him every single bad thing they could find, without giving him even one ounce of any redeeming traits - and that is really never a good decision.But all those points notwithstanding, this is a great film, with great performance by all actors, with special praise to Burl Ives who actually (very deservedly) won the Oscar of Best Supporting Actor for his role. Dialogs are good, characters are mostly well developed, there is some humour, always exactly at the right moment, the two leading (and competing) ladies are a delight for eyes and there is also one MONUMENTAL fist fight in form of shock of two titans of Hollywood...))) As for the music, well the ""Big Country"" score is already a LEGEND!This film definitely deserves to be bought, watched and kept for your children.

152714,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,079284517X,magellan,"[6, 6]","As others have written very complete reviews, I just had a few miscellaneous comments I hadn't seen elsewhere.It's interesting to contrast the quiet and unassuming confidence Peck projects in his character with the characters of the westerners, who assume Peck's low-key personality means he's a coward, or at least unwilling to defend himself, despite the fact that he's a former sea captain and has probably seen more danger on the high seas in a few years of sailing than most of the ranchers have seen in their entire lives. His manhood is constantly being questioned by the cowboy types, who don't understand Peck's more restrained nature nor his background.For example, in one scene he rides off into the desert overnight to visit a neighbor and doesn't come back the next day. They mount a search party, thinking he's lost, but he's not. He has a map and a compass, and he knows how to use them. Eventually he rides into the camp of the searchers, who haven't been able to find him yet, apparently none the worse for wear, but the ranch foreman accuses him of lying when Peck says he wasn't lost. The ignorant cowboys have no idea that a former sea captain like Peck, who could navigate a ship over thousands of miles of open sea with no landmarks with a sextent and a chronograph, would find it easy to navigate on land with a map and a compass. But the ranchers remain unconvinced.There are several other incidents like this, and even his new wife doubts him. In the end, however, Peck shows himself to be twice the man of any of the other brash and blustery cowboy types who have doubted him all along when he single-handedly confronts Burl Ives and his gang alone at the end of the movie. He also realizes that his wife, who also doubted him, isn't worth the trouble and isn't the girl for him. Instead, he ends up with the Jean Simmons, who understood him better all along (and who tried to talk sense into his wife, unsuccessfully), and who is a much classier lady, anyway.I have to agree with the other reviewers and say that Burl Ives is the real standout and surprise here, turning in a great performance as the crusty, scheming old patriarch of a disreputable family of ne'er-do-wells and ruffians who feels he deserves better, including his errant son, played by Chuck Connors, who also turns in a fine performance. It's too bad Connors didn't get that many other good roles like this, as he shows he's a much more capable actor than he's normally given credit for. The entire cast does a great job, actually, and Charlton Heston is also good in his role as Peck's nemesis, playing something of a bad guy with regard to Peck, but who eventually comes to appreciate Peck isn't the man he thought he was when he and Peck get into a fist fight. Both men end up taking and dishing out a lot of punishment during the course of the long fight, so there isn't exactly a clear winner, but Peck shows he can certainly take care of himself and isn't the pushover Heston had thought.The movie also has a great score that really adds to the ambience and drama, which helps, since the movie is over 2 hours and 40 minutes long. Overall, it's a fine movie and a great western that isn't as well known as it should be.

This are all movie legends who could really act and sadly all of them have passed away. But this is all of them at their peaks and in a great movie directed by william wyler. Who was a great director. IF you love big sprawling westerns with rich charactes then this one is for you. It's got the scenery to spare too. Ok; now on to the blu ray (which you can only get along with ""quigley down under"" at walmart, , it's a mixed bag, this isn't fully restored sadly. If any movie needed it too; it's this one with it's incredible vistas and landscapes but unlike the great western 'the searchers' which is years older than this it didn't get restored. (that one did)THe good news is that artifacts (specks, lines and dirt and hairs) are mostly not there!  You see damage on the main credits and from then on you only see an occasional speck and rarely at that.  Now the real problem is the color in some scenes it looks great and in others it's washed out. Some of the daylight scenes may not have been that blue to begin with , but others have clearly faded places on the bottom of the film. So you get a spectacular nighttime fireside scene followed by a shimmering color damaged scene, this damage and shimmering can be quite bad. Why won't mgm step up to the plate to restore this classic? I don't know.  Hell, their version of ""the terminator"" is a complete disgrace so this is better and it's now 53 years old! There are grainy scenes as well but that grain was probably part of the picture originally and isn't a problem unlike the color fading issues.  Still It's always sad to see the promise of blu ray not lived up to. At least this isn't all torn up like 'galaxina' is on blu ray. That fun sci fi flick from 1980 is ripped up looking even on blu.

This was  a  20th century fox movie by the way and the two companies are now one basically. The blu rhas several extra features and short documentary and such, no deleted scenes as they probably are long destroyed by now.  and even if they exist mgm isn't rushing to put out top notch discs it seems anyways.

152721,A1FG91CM8221X1,079284517X,Miles D. Moore,"[2, 3]","&quot;The Big Country,&quot; William Wyler's attempt at a Western super-masterpiece, doesn't quite achieve everything Wyler set out to do--there are a few too many panoramic scenes of the Great Plains, for example, in which nothing else is happening. The best parts of this movie, however, are so good that it easily deserves to be ranked as one of Hollywood's classic Westerns. It's interesting to contrast &quot;The Big Country&quot; with its contemporary, &quot;The Searchers,&quot; which was denigrated as a mere programmer when first released but now is hailed as perhaps the definitive Western. It's true that John Ford's view of Western society is more mordant and finely shaded than Wyler's. Also, John Wayne's performance in &quot;The Searchers&quot; blows away both Gregory Peck's and Charlton Heston's in &quot;The Big Country;&quot; and although both Franz Planer's photography in &quot;Big Country&quot; and Winton C. Hoch's in &quot;Searchers&quot; are astonishingly beautiful, Monument Valley is simply more interesting to look at than the empty plains. But for all that, I still prefer &quot;The Big Country,&quot; for any number of reasons. Its supporting cast is better than that in &quot;The Searchers,&quot; and has juicier roles to play; Vera Miles in &quot;Searchers&quot; simply can't compare with either Jean Simmons or Carroll Baker in &quot;Big Country,&quot; and Burl Ives' performance as Rufus Hanassey is one of the all-time classic character performances. Jerome Moross' score for &quot;Big Country&quot; is THE classic Western score of all time; the opening credits of &quot;Big Country,&quot; showing the stagecoach galloping across the plains to Moross' energizing, haunting main theme, is one of the most stirring images in all cinema. (Compare this with the syrupy folksiness of the Sons of the Pioneers, in my opinion a major irritant in all of Ford's Westerns.) But above all, the big difference between &quot;The Big Country&quot; and &quot;The Searchers&quot; is faith, hope and charity. &quot;The Big Country&quot; insists that reasonable men of good will can make a difference in their society; &quot;The Searchers&quot; sneers at such optimism, insisting that society and community are Band-Aids on the raging cancer of the world as it is. Somewhere between the two viewpoints lies reality, but I know which viewpoint I prefer. (If you want to see a really great John Ford Western, I recommend &quot;Stagecoach&quot; or &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.&quot;) Big in every way, with a panoramic sweep and vigor that improve with each successive viewing. &quot;The Big Country&quot; is a solid four-and-half stars, and I'm happy to throw in the extra half-star.",5,A fine Western that gets better with repeat viewings.,1078012800,"02 29, 2004",2004,2709,"['quot', 'Big', 'Country', 'quot', 'William', 'Wyler', 'attempt', 'Western', 'super-masterpiece', ""n't"", 'quite', 'achieve', 'everything', 'Wyler', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'are', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'panoramic', 'scenes', 'Great', 'Plains', 'example', 'nothing', 'else', 'happening', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'however', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'easily', 'be', 'ranked', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'classic', 'Westerns', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'quot', 'Big', 'Country', 'quot', 'contemporary', 'quot', 'Searchers', 'quot', 'was', 'denigrated', 'mere', 'programmer', 'when', 'first', 'released', 'now', 'hailed', 'perhaps', 'definitive', 'Western', 'true', 'John', 'Ford', 'view', 'Western', 'society', 'more', 'mordant', 'finely', 'shaded', 'Wyler', 'Also', 'John', 'Wayne', 'performance', 'quot', 'Searchers', 'quot', 'away', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'quot', 'Big', 'Country', 'quot', 'Franz', 'Planer', 'photography', 'quot', 'Big', 'Country', 'quot', 'Winton', 'C.', 'Hoch', 'quot', 'Searchers', 'quot', 'are', 'astonishingly', 'beautiful', 'Monument', 'Valley', 'simply', 'more', 'interesting', 'look', 'empty', 'plains', 'still', 'prefer', 'quot', 'Big', 'Country', 'quot', 'number', 'reasons', 'supporting', 'cast', 'better', 'quot', 'Searchers', 'quot', 'juicier', 'roles', 'play', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'quot', 'Searchers', 'quot', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'quot', 'Big', 'Country', 'quot', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'performance', 'Rufus', 'Hanassey', 'one', 'all-time', 'classic', 'character', 'performances', 'Jerome', 'Moross', 'score', 'quot', 'Big', 'Country', 'quot', 'classic', 'Western', 'score', 'time', 'opening', 'credits', 'quot', 'Big', 'Country', 'quot', 'showing', 'stagecoach', 'galloping', 'plains', 'Moross', 'energizing', 'haunting', 'main', 'theme', 'one', 'most', 'stirring', 'images', 'cinema', 'Compare', 'syrupy', 'folksiness', 'Sons', 'Pioneers', 'opinion', 'major', 'irritant', 'Ford', 'Westerns', 'big', 'difference', 'quot', 'Big', 'Country', 'quot', 'quot', 'Searchers', 'quot', 'faith', 'hope', 'charity', 'quot', 'Big', 'Country', 'quot', 'reasonable', 'men', 'good', 'will', 'can', 'make', 'difference', 'society', 'quot', 'Searchers', 'quot', 'sneers', 'such', 'optimism', 'insisting', 'society', 'community', 'are', 'Band-Aids', 'raging', 'cancer', 'world', 'Somewhere', 'two', 'viewpoints', 'reality', 'know', 'viewpoint', 'prefer', 'want', 'see', 'really', 'great', 'John', 'Ford', 'Western', 'recommend', 'quot', 'Stagecoach', 'quot', 'quot', 'Man', 'Who', 'Shot', 'Liberty', 'Valance.', 'quot', 'Big', 'way', 'panoramic', 'sweep', 'vigor', 'improve', 'successive', 'viewing', 'quot', 'Big', 'Country', 'quot', 'solid', 'four-and-half', 'stars', ""'m"", 'happy', 'throw', 'extra', 'half-star']",N/A

152727,AYU9LBROYQBG6,079284517X,"Noel Serrano ""Gala Foundation http://gfoundat...","[2, 3]","The Big Country is a 1958 American Western film directed by William Wyler. It stars Gregory Peck, Jean Simmons, Carroll Baker, Charlton Heston, Burl Ives, Charles Bickford, and Chuck Connors. Based on the novel by Donald Hamilton.Ives won the Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor as well as the Golden Globe Award. The film was also nominated for an Academy Award for the musical score by Jerome Moross.Wealthy, newly-retired sea captain and ship-owner James McKay (Gregory Peck) travels to the American west to rejoin his fianc&eacute;e Patricia (Carroll Baker), whom he had met back East, at the enormous ranch of her father, Major Terrill (Charles Bickford). Terrill is a powerful rancher who is feuding with the equally tough patriarch of a poorer, uncouth, and less refined clan, Rufus Hannassey (Burl Ives). Patricia's best friend, schoolteacher Julie Maragon (Jean Simmons), is caught between the two, as she is the owner of the ""Big Muddy"", a (smaller) big ranch with a vital source of water desired by both men; Hannassey desperately needs it for his cattle, while Terrill wants to gain control of it to bring his rival down.McKay is a puzzle to Major Terrill, his foreman Steve Leech (Charlton Heston) and even his fiancee; he refuses to be provoked into proving his manhood, even when harassed. We learn that McKay's father died in a duel, and -- as McKay explains to Terrill -- no one could remember what the duel was about. One morning, McKay rides out alone, goes to the Big Muddy, and persuades Julie to sell him the ranch, promising her that both the Terrills and the Hannesseys will always have access to the river, hoping that this will defuse the conflict. She agrees to the sale.Back at the Terrill ranch, everyone believes McKay is lost. A search party is organized and spends two days looking for him. When McKay shows up, and says he knew where he was all the time, Leech -- who is himself in love with Patricia -- calls him a liar in front of Patricia and the Major. McKay refuses to be goaded into a fight. In private, Patricia expresses her shame at what she sees as McKay's cowardice. McKay tells her he'll be moving into town in the morning, to give them both time to think things over. Early the next morning, McKay goes out to the bunkhouse to settle things with Leech. They fight away from the house, without witnesses, to an exhausted draw - which, as McKay points out, has solved precisely nothing. Leech gains a new respect for McKay.Later, Patricia discovers from Julie that McKay has bought the Big Muddy, and goes into town to try to make up with him. However, when she mentions her father's plans for the Big Muddy, McKay tells her it's over, as he will have no part in continuing the feud. Patricia explodes with rage, telling him that he'll never be half the man her father is.Terrill orders Leech and his men to drive the Hannassey's cattle away from watering at the Big Muddy. Hannassey, desperate, contrives a plot to kidnap Julie Maragon. Rufus offers to buy the Big Muddy in exchange for her freedom. He doesn't know whether to believe her when she tells him she has already sold the Big Muddy to McKay. Hannassey decides to keep her at the ranch, as the bait for an ambush he has prepared for Terrill and his men. To rescue Julie, they must pass through the narrow canyon leading up to the Hannassey homestead, where they can be easily gunned down.McKay rides in alone, despite Terrill's opposition, to try seek a peaceful solution. Hannessey's eldest son Buck (Chuck Connors), who wants Julie for himself, tells her to lie to McKay about her reason for being there, or he will shoot him. McKay arrives and shows Hannassey the deed to Big Muddy, and promises him access to the water there. When Hannassey says he intends to fight Terrill anyway, McKay confronts him with the truth - that it is all just about a personal vendetta between two ruthless, vicious old men who are willing to get a lot of others killed to settle their feud. Julie, whose feelings for McKay are by now obvious, tries to protect him by saying she is there willingly, but McKay doesn't believe her. McKay and Buck begin to fight, but Rufus stops it when Buck draws on an unarmed McKay. He then decides they will settle it ""gentleman style"", with the dueling pistols in McKay's saddlebag. He warns the two men that he'll shoot either one of them if they violate the rules.After walking off ten paces, both men turn and aim. Buck fires before the signal, grazing McKay's forehead. McKay slowly and deliberately takes aim. Defenseless, Buck succumbs to fear and drops to the ground in terror. McKay then fires his shot into the dirt. Hannassey walks over and spits on his son for his humiliating cowardice. As McKay and Julie prepare to leave, Buck grabs a gun from a ranch hand, but Hannassey shoots and kills him.Meantime, Terrill, Leech and their men have ridden into the ambush and are pinned down in the canyon. Although Leech realized that the risk was too great, he is unable to dissuade Terrill from going into the canyon, and ultimately Leech follows him in out of loyalty. Acknowledging the truth of McKay's accusation, Hannassey orders his men to hold their fire. He then challenges Terrill to come out and face him man to man. The two men walk to a final showdown and kill each other. McKay and Julie ride out together.[edit] Commentary on the Cold WarThe Big Country came out during the Cold War and in the aftermath of the McCarthy hearings. The film depicts the two alternatives of diplomacy (taught by McKay) and brinkmanship and personal grudges leading to mutually assured destruction (Terrill and Hannessey). Moreover, The Big Country depicts McKay grudgingly earning the respect of others and of the audience. It is said that President Dwight D. Eisenhower showed the movie several times in the White House during his second administration.",5,EXCELLENT WESTERN MIRRORING THE COLD WAR ERA,1237334400,"03 18, 2009",2009,5879,"['Big', 'Country',

This sets the scene for violent outbursts, gun fights and verbal conflicts. That will satisfy the men :).Now, for the women, this movie has wonderful fighting over the women and a undercurrent of romance between rancher/school teacher Julie Moragon (Jean Simmons) and the intellectual even-tempered Jim McKay (Gregory Peck). Jim McKay is actually engaged to Mr. Terrill's shallow but beautiful daughter, Patricia (Carroll Baker). His competition, Steve Leech (Charlton Heston) is a brooding, rugged ranch foreman who loves the land and will fight for what he wants. The relationship between Jim and Patricia is shaky at best. There is no real depth.Jim McKay is from the East and doesn't realize he has walked into age old feud in the West. Once he realizes what needs to be done, he bravely helps to solve the problems with intellect instead of brawn. He uses his ""sea captain"" skills to navigate the open range of the west and brings a cool ocean breeze to this heated dry land.The poor Rufus Hannassey (Burl Ives) plays the patriarch of a disreputable clan who is fighting for their water rights. As cattle die, the situation escalates to a shoot out. His long time enemy rich Mr. Terrill (Charles Brickford) is determined to destroy him for good.""If there is anything I admire more than a devoted friend, it's a dedicated enemy."" -Mr. TerrillWhile this is a explosive drama, there are some very amusing lines which will catch you unawares. The chemistry between Jean Simmons and Gregory Peck is mild, yet romantic. The jealous foreman, Steve Leech seems tormented through the entire movie by his attraction to Patricia which creates a sense of tension through the whole movie.This is not a movie for the impatient. This is a movie for those who appreciate great acting and story telling at its best.

152734,AMZYAGVDQWTS,079284517X,Reviews No More,"[6, 6]","I don't like westerns much but, as other reviewers have pointed out, this isn't a typical western.  In order to avoid retelling the plot, which was explained beautifully by the spotlight reviewer, I only have to say that this was the first western I began to watch and couldn't tear myself away from until it was over.  Great all-star cast, beautiful music score, and an addictive storyline all under the direction of William Wyler made this more than a pleasure to watch.  I love a movie with a moral, and this one may be long, but it makes its point with no mistaking its intention.Gregory Peck has always been my mother's favorite actor, and this is very well one of his best roles as well as that of Atticus Finch.  Let's just say I'm becoming a fan for lots of good reasons.  Burl Ives gives an outstanding performance as Rufus Hannessey--so much so that you figure out rather quickly who the real menace in the storyline is.  His character's integrity makes him empathetic as opposed to the bullying, wealthy adversary.  Both men, however are fools, and the end of the story can't help but turn out as it does--I won't give it away if you haven't seen it.Big Country is a big western with big actors and big production.  It's a grand, sweeping saga full of beautiful scenery and high emotions.  Even if you don't ordinarily like westerns (like yours truly), I guarantee you will love this one, particularly for the moral it involves.

I purchased a copy on the advice of a friend and the music and scenery are excellent.  The characters are a mixture.  Gregory Peck's character is strong and fearless as a ship's captain should be.  The character of his intended wife leaves you wondering what he saw in her.  The Major, his intended's father, is a self appointed Lord of his domain.  He will brook no interferance in his plans or decisions which sets off a chain of events.  GP's character is misunderstood by almost everyone; he ends up breaking a wild stallion with only a audience of himself and a ranch hand while being thought a coward, he navigates his way around their hundreds of miles of ranchland with a compass and is thought a fool and liar, he buys up the best land with a river ""The Big Muddy"" intending to share it with everyone and is thought of as playing one side against the other.  In the end the characters of GP and Burl Ives stand out.  Burl Ives plays an uncouth old rancher who has a nobility about him while living with his worthless son and competeing against the unscrupulous Major. (Spoiler alert).  In the end, the only people with much nobility are Burl Ives, GP, Jean Simmons, and the Mexican ranch hand.  Charlton Heston only reveals his nobility in the end and Burl Ives ends up beign part of his own ""final solution"".

152739,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,079284517X,Robert Morris,"[131, 137]","What we have here is a blood feud over water rights between two ranching families headed by Major Henry Terrill (Charles Bickford) and Rufus Hannassey (Burl Ives), with school teacher Julie Maragon (Jean Simmons) caught in the middle. Directed by William Wyler with stunning cinematography by Franz Planer, we follow a narrative which involves the engagement of Easterner James McKay (Gregory Peck) to Terrill's beloved daughter Pat (Carroll Baker). Frankly, what he sees in her continues to elude my understanding. Some reviewers have dismissed this as a ""B"" movie but I do not. The quality of the acting (notably Ives's which earned him an Academy Award for best supporting actor) is outstanding. Although in what I guess could be considered a minor role as Steve Leech, Terrill's ramrod, Charlton Heston delivers a remarkably nuanced and controlled performance as does Chuck Connors as Buck Hannassey. This is much less a western than a study of two patriarchs (Terrill and Hannassey) who play a zero sum game to gain control of access to water on which they and their herds obviously depend. But there is something else at work in this great but (for whatever reasons) under appreciated film. Julie Maragon is quite willing to allow both patriarchs access to the water. That is not the core issue: rather, it is the conflict between the inflated egos of two proud and stubborn men who detest each other.For me, one of the most memorable scenes occurs when, just before dawn, McKay and Leech finally have it out. It is an awkward but inevitable and immensely effective fist fight, with much of it filmed as if we were observing it at a distance. Of course, the fist fight achieves nothing other than demonstrating that McKay is more of a ""man"" than Leech once thought. Before they begin throwing punches, McKay insists that no one know about their fight.  Leech totally misunderstands McKay's reasons. Another memorable sequence of events focuses on Terrill and Hannassey as they slowly and carefully work their way through a canyon to their final confrontation. To repeat, theirs is a zero sum game except that neither wins. In these and other scenes, Planer's cinematography and Jerome Moross' music score blend effectively with the cast's superb performances under Wyler's direction.Why has The Big Country been under appreciated, if not totally ignored among western films?

The story of a New England sailor, James McKay (Gregory Peck), who enters the Old West, is told so effectively, the 165 minute run-time seems half that length.The plot concerns McKay, who unwittingly enters the family feud between the Hannasseys and the Terrills.  Both families are cattle ranchers who rely on Julie Maragon (Jean Simmons) who owns 'The Big Muddy', a stretch of land that controls the water flow in the area. Essentially, the film follows McKay, as he endlessly struggles; with his feelings for his betrothed, Patricia Terrill (Carroll Baker); with the envy of chief Terrill ranch-hand Steve Leech (Charlton Heston); and with the blood-lust, pride and tradition of his prospective father-in-law, Major Henry Terrill (Charles Bickford).Aside from Julie Maragon, the only character who is quick to understand McKay is patriarch Rufus Hannassey (Burl Ives), who is nevertheless, blinded by his own need for revenge.  Worse yet, is Rufus' son Buck (Chuck Connors), who is a character foil to McKay, and symbolizes everything low and cowardly.  While dealing with this largely unsavoury cast of characters, McKay tries to stay true to himself.My favourite scene involves a fist-fight between Heston and Peck.  But it is not the fight which is principally arresting.  Rather, it is the backdrop of the fight ... an early morning sky with a shock of blue Technicolor light.  This background gives the scene a certain ethereal majesty, and is reminiscent (probably intentionally) of Jacob fighting the angel to a standstill in the Book of Genesis.  A most memorable, beautiful visual experience.Every facet of the film was above par.  The writing, Jerome Moross score, the cinematography, editing; everything clicks.  Kudos to Gregory Peck, Charlton Heston, Charles Bickford, Burl Ives, and Chuck Connors for superlative performances.I look forward to this release on Blu-ray, where I hope a remastered edition will correct current picture deficiencies.",5,The Big Country: A Big Experience,1255651200,"10 16, 2009",2009,2095,"['Big', 'Country', '1958', 'William', 'Wyler', 'did', 'magnificent', 'job', 'directing', 'THE', 'BIG', 'COUNTRY', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'many', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'constructed', 'story', 'New', 'England', 'sailor', 'James', 'McKay', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'who', 'Old', 'West', 'told', 'so', 'effectively', '165', 'minute', 'run-time', 'length.The', 'plot', 'concerns', 'McKay', 'who', 'unwittingly', 'family', 'feud', 'Hannasseys', 'Terrills', 'families', 'are', 'cattle', 'ranchers', 'who', 'rely', 'Julie', 'Maragon', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'who', 'Big', 'Muddy', 'stretch', 'land', 'water', 'flow', 'area', 'Essentially', 'film', 'McKay', 'endlessly', 'feelings', 'betrothed', 'Patricia', 'Terrill', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'envy', 'chief', 'Terrill', 'ranch-hand', 'Steve', 'Leech', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'blood-lust', 'pride', 'tradition', 'prospective', 'father-in-law', 'Major', 'Henry', 'Terrill', 'Charles', 'Bickford', '.Aside', 'Julie', 'Maragon', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'quick', 'understand', 'McKay', 'patriarch', 'Rufus', 'Hannassey', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'who', 'nevertheless', 'blinded', 'own', 'need', 'revenge', 'Worse', 'yet', 'Rufus', 'son', 'Buck', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'who', 'character', 'foil', 'McKay', 'everything', 'low', 'cowardly', 'dealing', 'largely', 'unsavoury', 'cast', 'characters', 'McKay', 'stay', 'true', 'himself.My', 'favourite', 'scene', 'fist-fight', 'Heston', 'Peck', 'not', 'fight', 'principally', 'arresting', 'Rather', 'backdrop', 'fight', 'early', 'morning', 'sky', 'shock', 'blue', 'Technicolor', 'light', 'background', 'scene', 'certain', 'ethereal', 'majesty', 'reminiscent', 'probably', 'intentionally', 'Jacob', 'fighting', 'angel', 'standstill', 'Book', 'Genesis', 'most', 'memorable', 'beautiful', 'visual', 'experience.Every', 'facet', 'film', 'was', 'par', 'writing', 'Jerome', 'Moross', 'score', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'everything', 'clicks', 'Kudos', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'superlative', 'performances.I', 'look', 'forward', 'release', 'Blu-ray', 'where', 'hope', 'remastered', 'edition', 'will', 'correct', 'current', 'picture', 'deficiencies']",N/A

Adult, smart, original, exciting, beautiful to look at, one of the most spectacular movie scores until Magnificent 7 and Dances With Wolves. (Why are the most inspiring scores western?)I won't go into plot, everyone else did that. I do have trivia though:I lived on a ranch and my landlady was actually the stunt lady for Jean Simmons and Caroll Baker. A small blond, she was the daughter of a horse trainer who trained movie stars to play polo in the 40s when polo was red-hot. This woman could ride like a Cossack and also played Debra Paget's double in the first Elvis picture ""Love Me Tender"" in which she jumped a horse off the bridge into the lake. I'm also suspicious that she may have doubled for Kim Darby in True Grit '69. She was small enough to play a 14 yr old girl.She related that the movie was shot in Stockton, Calif., not Texas, and it was a very hot shoot, filmed in summer.Contrary to their characters who didn't get along at all, Jean Simmons and Chuck Connors were carrying on a red-hot affair while filming.The outlaw Appaloosa horse that tries to do in Peck was owned by Slim Pickens, an movie horse wrangler who fell into acting. One of the most intelligent horses who ever lived. Slim trained him. I had seen a picture in a horse magazine of Slim and this gelding jumping a convertible car with people sitting straight up in it. Probably a jump of a 5 foot spread and 5 feet in height. AND carrying the bulk of Slim who was originally a rodeo rider and trainer.William Wyler wanted to make a great movie in each genre. Boy, did he succeed. A few years later, he made this little Biblical called ""Ben Hur.""The movie score was as perfect as they come. My only complaint was the energetic piece played whenever Terrell made raids on the Hennesseys was never put on the (vinyl) record. This was the first time I came to realize that the major standard instrument for the western movie was the trumpet. You'll hear trumpets now in almost all westerns.

John Ford used this same combination to produce a series of successful Westerns, and it is  wonderful to see someone else use a similiar pattern. It is the unspoken  theme that sets this film apart: A Big Country requires a Big Man. And  exactly what kind of Big Man is needed? Well, the contrasts are what make  this film interesting.Major Henry Terrill has all the appearance of  integrity, but none of the substance. Rufus Hannassey is nearly the  opposite. Each of these men have a top hand. Terrill has Steve Leech, who  he raised. Rufus has his son Buck. Leech and Buck are opposites: Buck is  one of the nastest bad guys you've ever seen, while Leech seems to embody  all the stero-typical hero elements. The opposites are not there just for  the story's sake, they beg the question &quot;What is the measure of a  man?&quot;It is also tempting to suggest, &quot;What is the measure of a  woman?&quot; because even the women in this story seem to be opposites:  Patricia Terrill is as spoiled and impulsive as her friend, Julie Maragon  is self reliant and reflective.Into this world comes James McKay. Almost  immediately McKay comes in conflict with the appearance-only nature of the  Terrill side of the conflict. Leech, like his mentor, needs an outward show  to back up his authority. When McKay demonstrates that appearances do not  translate into real authority, that integrity means much more, Leech's view  of the world begins to crumble.The conflict between Rufus, who has a  measure of integrity, and his son, who has no redeeming characteristics, is  sad. Near the film's end, McKay forces Rufus to accept the consequences of  his integrity.It is interesting that McKay is really not an intruder, he  is (in fact) restoring balance to a community. In the film we learn that  Julie Maragon's Grandfather played the role that McKay is obviously going  to fill. Unfortunately, because of his death, the Big Country has been  going to rack and ruin (as symbolized by the deteriorating Grand  House).One could argue that this film is about who is the rightful heir  to the Big Country: the bickering, fighting families or Julie Maragon and  her Man. I believe that Wyler answers the question clearly. The rightful  heir is he who can maintain balance by means of clear sight and  integrity.I wish this film was released in a Wide Screen version (on  DVD).

152767,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,079284517X,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","""The Big Country"" is an epic Western from 1958. It tells the story of New Englander James McKay (Gregory Peck), who goes out West to meet up with his fianc&eacute;, Patricia (Caroll Baker), on her father's huge ranch. McKay stirs up rivalry in the stud foreman of the ranch, Leech (Charleton Heston), and finds himself in the middle of a feud over water rights.Also on hand are Charles Bickford as Patricia's father, Major Terrill, Burl Ives as the patriarch of the Hannessey clan and Chuck Conners as his brutish son.Shot in remote areas of California and running 2 hours and 46 minutes, ""The Big Country"" is engrossing from beginning to end. As with all great films, it has excellent character development. These people seem real. They have good points and bad. For instance, Patricia and her father are introduced as protagonists, but we slowly discover that they're selfish and immature in some ways. Rufus Hannessey starts out as somewhat of a villain but the viewer can't help but respect him as the story unfolds. Conners is excellent as the loathsome Buck Hannessey and Jean Simmons is perfect as the angelic owner of the watering hole.I like how McKay refuses to take Leech's bait and handles him on his own terms. Also his refusal to try to prove his manhood to anyone other than himself. Despite his conditional pacifism (which is different than absolute pacifism), McKay proves he's ten times the man Major Terrill is. Note how he treats the Hispanic stableman and his family with respect and appreciation while Terrill speaks down to them like they're his slaves.It's inexplicable why ""The Big Country"" isn't normally cited with the best Westerns.

152768,A1DZSBTVCJ883,079284517X,W. Walker,"[2, 2]","There have been many fine reviews of this film already. Thus, I will largely confine my remarks to one of the themes of the film: the incompatabilities that  most contributed to the breakup of marriage plans between Jim McKay (Gregory Peck) and Pat Terrill(Carroll Baker). But, first, I would like to point out that, although not hinted in the film, the feud between the Hannasseys and Terrills was likely rooted in ethnic and religious bigotry. Hannassey is an Irish name, whereas the Terrills were most likely of English ancestry. This fits the general perception of Irish immigrants as uncouth ruffians.Pat soon figured out that Jim was determined to be his own man in this big country, not just her father's puppet. Strike one against him. She also discovered that Jim was too aloof to the rough and tumble western ranch culture for her liking. Not only did he show minimal hostility toward the rough hazing reception by the Hannassey ""boys"", he refused to cooperate with the baiting challenges of riding a notoriously untamable horse or brawling with Steve(Charleton Heston), who also had the hots for Pat. The latter 2 challengers he eventually met, but only when there was no crowd to make him a spectacle, win or lose. Unlike some reviewers, I don't see Jim's aloofness from these challenges as necessasarily a sign of superior nobleness. Rather, they seem prudent responses. Also, he was much influenced by his father's death in a duel over what, in retrospect, was a rather trifling matter. It was prudent to try not to show great fear nor anger  when faced with a gang of ruffian hazers in an unfamiliar territory and culture.  It was prudent not to risk making fool of himself before a crowd, including his fiancee, in trying to ride a horse hinted at as being very wild, nor was it gentlemanly to engage in a fistfight over the seemingly trivial question of whether he had been lost in his solo survey of the ranch. Later, when learning of the kidnaping of his new love, Julie(Jean Simmons) by the Hannasseys, he ignored prudence and played the role of potential hero and peacemaker or dead man. The lines between courage and foolhardiness and between cowardice and prudence will always be blurred in certain circumstances.Various reviewers have made the point that a fundamental difference between Jim and Pat was that Jim believed that what he was really like and had accomplished was more important, whereas Pat believed how others saw you was more important than what you were really like. The film biases our opinion to see Jim's ethos as the better of the two, but remember that Peck was a coproducer of the film. As I see it, in the real world, both are important. Reputation often makes the difference between success and failure in the business world, whether based on fact or fiction. However, Pat should have understood that Jim had prudent reasons, consistent with his aloofish personality, for responding to these  challenges as he did. Afterall, as an ex-sea captain, Jim was used to exhibiting a degree of aloofness. Interestingly, when it came to sharing water rights that he now technically owned, something really important to all his neighbors, Jim was not aloof, declaring all neighboring parties had equal access to his water as they had under Julie's father. Julie, as a non-cattlewoman heir to her father's land, had been too weak and too connected with the Terrills to fully enforce the tradition of equal water access.
