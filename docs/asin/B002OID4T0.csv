It's very enjoyable; I love the interaction between the three (later four) Rangers (four/five, I suppose, if you count Captain Parmalee).  I think it would have been just fine without the Erik character (they seem to have taken part of Chad's personality and transplanted it to him), but he does have his own charm.I love that it's not crude, foulmouthed, and vulgar the way so much tv is these days.  It's funny, and dramatic, and I'm glad I bought it.(One thing:  I know I'm supposed to find the Reese character charming and humorous, but maybe because I've watched too many episodes in too short a time, mostly I find him deeply stupid, loudmouthed, and annoying).",5,Wish we still had shows like this!,1317081600,"09 27, 2011",2011,767,"['came', 'set', 'very', 'low', 'price', 'somewhere', 'being', 'tv-western', 'mood', 'bought', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'love', 'interaction', 'three', 'later', 'four', 'Rangers', 'four/five', 'suppose', 'count', 'Captain', 'Parmalee', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'fine', 'Erik', 'character', 'seem', 'have', 'taken', 'part', 'Chad', 'personality', 'transplanted', 'have', 'own', 'charm.I', 'not', 'crude', 'foulmouthed', 'vulgar', 'way', 'so', 'much', 'tv', 'days', 'funny', 'dramatic', ""'m"", 'glad', 'bought', 'One', 'thing', 'know', ""'m"", 'supposed', 'find', 'Reese', 'character', 'charming', 'humorous', 'maybe', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'too', 'many', 'episodes', 'too', 'short', 'time', 'mostly', 'find', 'deeply', 'stupid', 'loudmouthed', 'annoying']",N/A

""wicmar""","[18, 20]","This was a favorite show of mine when I was growing up, but I'd quite forgotten it until the first DVD set was released a couple of years ago. I'm so glad that it's back in circulation. This light-hearted, funny take on classic 60s westerns has plenty of action, but also plenty of great give-and-take among the three Texas Rangers who are the main characters. It doesn't take itself seriously at all. Neville Brand is the heart of the show--usually typecast as a villain, but with great comedic chops as the goofy but lovable Ranger. You'll also see a few great character actors and even a future movie star or two.

1280985,A2A8J1N23BUM70,B002OID4T0,New Yorker,"[3, 3]","Laredo has a fan base broader than that of most of the western TV series of the 1950s and 1960s, becauseit was uniquely comic--slapstick and silliness but also character comedy. The three (later four) leadseach represented a different character type. Reese is a ridiculous blunderer. Chad is the ladies' man.Joe is the most dangerous, and a smoldering hunk, though he's usually snoozing. The fourth lead, Erik,added in the second and last season, is less easy to describe. He had a slight accent ofsome kind, so I'll just call him European. Then there was Captain Parmalee, whose attitudewas that of the strict CEO, forever exasperated by the boys--though they always did get the jobdone, one way or another. So, against a background of the shoot-'em-up westernis this other show about how the rangers work with, joke with, and fool each other. They are very loyal forall their irreverance, and there are amusing guest stars--Eve Arden, for instance, and also the woman whobecame famous much later as Megan Mullally's maid on Will & Grace. She plays Linda Littletrees, a mostlytaciturn Indian with a gigantic crush on William Smith. Laredo may not be the greatest western series of alltime, but like some others--The Wild, Wild West, for instance--it has its own flavor and is richlyenjoyable. It's too bad that the set doesn't include the pilot, which, as other reviewers have explained,is actually an episode of The Virginian. It's not a great episode, but it's interesting because Joe, Chad, andReese are actually rather unpleasant in it, suggesting that the Laredo staff hadn't yet ascertained whattone they wanted to take.

1280987,A1Z0LLO7WEKMUW,B002OID4T0,"Randle Rector ""Randy""","[3, 3]","I was reading the reviews here on Amazon of ""F-Troop,"" another 1965-1967 Western set at a frontier fort, when I remembered ""Laredo"" and just had to search for it. I watched both series in prime time when I was a kid, and I'm anxious to get the DVDs so I can relive all the fun. ""F-Troop"" had Captain Wilton Parmenter (Ken Berry) and ""Laredo"" had Captain Edward Parmalee (Philip Carey). I used to get ""Parmenter"" and ""Parmalee"" mixed up. The difference between the two shows was that ""F-Troop"" was straight comedy while ""Laredo"" was a kind of comedy-drama.As another reviewer said, even if you don't like Westerns you might enjoy this. ""Laredo"" was even popular enough at the time to have some of the episodes put together as a theatrical release. I saw that movie and although I don't remember too much about the plot, I know it involved a recurring humorous character in the show. She was an Indian woman who continually wore a straight face (kind of like Garfield the cat), and she was always sucking on a piece of licorice. There was laughter in the theater during the scene when she was watching one of the handsome rangers from a distance (with her usual bland expression), and then he took off his shirt. She really sat up and took notice then, lol!So here's to all of you who remember ""Laredo"" fondly (as I do), and to all of you who have yet to discover it.
