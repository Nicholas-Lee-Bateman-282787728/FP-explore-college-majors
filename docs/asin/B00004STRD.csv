It would be great to watch a commentary by Allen explaining his choices for making a movie like this. It's an interesting film about a fictional jazz musician and his life, filled with both triumphs and heart-wrenching downfalls. Penn plays Emmett Ray, the jazz guitarist who is chronicled in the movie. Penn does a fantastic job. Samantha Morton plays his girlfriend, who he leaves to pursue his dreams of stardom, but the film leaves us believing that we should all be careful of what we wish for and not take anything, or anyone, for granted. It's one of Woody Allen's best movies of the last 20 years, and it's supported by some great performances by Penn and Morton.

Something new, I dunno...  I'm still chewing on that one... Days after I've watched the movie...It  might be the characters that are extremely funny.

Brilliant!!), they  are also composed of a lot of witty and simple characteristics that they  become geniusly complex. For good and for worse.

To tell the truth I always found that his &quot;acclaimed&quot; comedies like &quot;Annie Hall&quot; or &quot;Manhattan&quot; were pretensious and overated. Every so often though  Allen directs a movie which strikes me as pure genius. &quot;Hannah and Her  Sisters&quot; and &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanours&quot; are both fabulous  character driven drama's. Without a doubt &quot;Sweet and Lowdown&quot; is  as good as both of those films.What really puts &quot;Sweet and  Lowdown&quot; above most movies is the superb performances. Sean Penn and  Samantha Morton each turn in the best performances of their careers. Penn  plays an arrogant jazz guitarist who's life has been reconstructed for this  film based on opinions and alledged stories. Morton plays his deaf  girlfriend who over the years becomes dependant upon him.Watching the  two play their roles perfectly is the real pleasure of this movie. Penn is  full of bluster but is constantly alluding to a sensitive side that never  really comes out. Morton as the deaf girl is splendid. She deserved the  Oscar she was nominated for as her subtlety and facial gestures are what  makes this performance a gem.The script is of course well written and  amusing. Allen has finally veered away (if only for a little bit) from his  neurotic pacing. After the dismal and unfunny &quot;Celebrity&quot; in  which Kenneth Branagh did a karaoke Woody Allen it is nice to see him scrap  the neurosis all together.&quot;Sweet and Lowdown&quot; is essentially a  character study.

Unlike the films, post Annie Hall, in which the unbeautiful Allen invariably plays a ""romantic"" lead, he has, this time out, stayed out of the camera's way to create what amounts to a biopic of legendary, yet little-known, guitarist Emmett Ray--considered by many to be the second greatest jazz guitarist ever, after Django Rheinhardt.Penn's performance as the gambling, drunken, pimping, egocentric, unfeeling Ray (who faints at the sight of Django and weeps at the sound of his music) is just terrific. Better yet is Samantha Morton's portrait of the mute Hattie, with whom Ray lives off and on for a number of years. In truth, this is Morton's movie. She is heartbreakingly good as the forever-eating, lovestruck young woman who, at the sound of Penn's/Ray's rendition of ""I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles"" loses her heart.The music is the other star of this film; it is great stuff--a soundtrack worth having for lovers of early jazz.

It came on IFC the other night and since I've been on this Independent Film kick lately, that and it starred Penn, Morton and Thurman, I decided to give it a watch through.  I had heard good things about it, mostly about Morton's performance as well as Penn, so I can honestly say I had high expectations.  Those expectations, sadly, were not met.First of all I want to say that Penn's performance was so overrated I was left appalled that he was even considered among Spacey, Crowe and Washington that year.  Morton on the other hand did add some weight to the picture and proved that she is a commanding actress even when she says not a single word.Penn plays fictional jazz guitarist Emmett Ray, a very conceded and irresponcible man who spent his time womanizing and obsessing over better known musician Djamgo Reinhardt.  The film follows this mans life as he takes up with Hattie (Morton) a mute woman who's nave enough to love this man and then leaves her to marry aspiring news reporter Blanche (Thurman) who is using Emmett for a story.  The much underused Anthony LaPaglia and Brad Garrett make almost too-short cameos as gangsters who get involved with Emmett and Blanche.All in all this was a very slow moving film that eventually went nowhere.  Woody Allen is known as a classic director, and that maybe the case, but this is nowhere near classic.  It's mockumentary style of directing is annoying since it's not funny nor interesting, and Sean Penn is just plain ridiculous (as is his character) in this over hyped film.",2,Maybe I'm blind but I just don't see it...,1159228800,"09 26, 2006",2006,1637,"['just', 'want', 'say', 'really', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'bring', 'came', 'IFC', 'other', 'night', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Independent', 'Film', 'kick', 'lately', 'starred', 'Penn', 'Morton', 'Thurman', 'decided', 'give', 'watch', 'had', 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'mostly', 'Morton', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'Penn', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'expectations', 'sadly', 'were', 'not', 'met.First', 'want', 'say', 'Penn', 'performance', 'was', 'so', 'overrated', 'was', 'left', 'appalled', 'was', 'even', 'considered', 'Spacey', 'Crowe', 'Washington', 'year', 'Morton', 'other', 'hand', 'did', 'add', 'weight', 'picture', 'proved', 'commanding', 'actress', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'single', 'word.Penn', 'fictional', 'jazz', 'guitarist', 'Emmett', 'Ray', 'very', 'conceded', 'irresponcible', 'man', 'who', 'spent', 'time', 'womanizing', 'obsessing', 'over', 'better', 'known', 'musician', 'Djamgo', 'Reinhardt', 'film', 'mans', 'life', 'up', 'Hattie', 'Morton', 'mute', 'woman', 'who', 'nave', 'enough', 'love', 'man', 'then', 'marry', 'aspiring', 'news', 'reporter', 'Blanche', 'Thurman', 'who', 'using', 'Emmett', 'story', 'much', 'underused', 'Anthony', 'LaPaglia', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'make', 'almost', 'too-short', 'cameos', 'gangsters', 'who', 'get', 'involved', 'Emmett', 'Blanche.All', 'was', 'very', 'slow', 'moving', 'film', 'eventually', 'went', 'nowhere', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'known', 'classic', 'director', 'maybe', 'case', 'nowhere', 'near', 'classic', 'mockumentary', 'style', 'directing', 'annoying', 'not', 'funny', 'interesting', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'just', 'plain', 'ridiculous', 'character', 'hyped', 'film']",N/A

Sanderman,"[3, 3]","Whether it's the quirky antics of Emmett Ray (Penn) or the wonderfully, understated affection of Hattie (Morton), this movie manages to strike a chord with a host of movie audiences.  The story, about the second-greatest guitar player in the world and his tragic life as a musician/womanizer, is made even more interesting by the biographical method that Allen uses to unfold the story.  What is particularly interesting about this approach is to note how every person sounds almost magical when talked about by fans and others-to witness their (often) destructive lives is something far different.  Additionally, Allen's humor penetrates the film, but it is not distracting.  In fact, in most places, it serves to make the ""storytelling"" style of the film more enjoyable to watch.Samantha Morton's performance as Hattie (a mute lover of Emmett's) is absolutely superb.  I find myself leaning forward towards the screen, as if expecting her to speak at any moment.  Morton manages to leap along just fine without any dialogue; her performance is believable and is truly one of the most endearing aspects of the film.  One feels for Emmett's loss and tragedy, but it is nothing compared to the emotion one feels for Hattie's character.A fan of Woody Allen will certainly enjoy this film and those that have given up on Allen in recent years will find this film to be a nice change.

Maybe if he had played a guitar like Emmett Ray we would still be together. I was 16 when I  met him and although not mute like Hattie, I thought he was pretty cool in  his Marine uniform.  He was basically an insecure guy who had been a  battered child like Emmet Ray.I've been a Woody Allen fan since he was  married to Louise Lasseter (Remember the tv series 'Soap'?) -- who looked a  bit like Samantha Morton who looks a bit like Mia Farrow.  I've seen most  of Woody's films, some of them, like &quot;Hannah&quot; and  &quot;Annie&quot; muliple times. I think one either is or is not a Woody  fan and it seems to be a generational thing. My oldest son says the only  film I ever recommended to him that he hated was a Woody Allen film.My  all time favorite is &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters.&quot; I hated  &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot; not because it was not a great film,  but because of the ending. &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot;, &quot;Manhatten  Murder Mystery&quot; and &quot;Annie Hall&quot; were all good films.  &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot; was entertaining -- who else but Woody  would ask Tim Roth and Alan Alda to sing?  And &quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot;  was a road trip.Woody has a way of showcasing female actresses, taking  advantage of both their ditzy and vulnerable qualities, and making them the  heroines of his pieces. Anyone who thinks Woody doesn't like women better  take another look at his films.  His best find was probably Diane Keaton,  although Diane Weist wasn't far behind.

Mira Sorvino picked up an oscar, and Samantha  Morton almost made it for &quot;Sweet and Lowdown&quot;.&quot;Sweet and  Lowdown&quot; has it's funny moments, but it's probably one of the most sad  and wistful films Woody has made, and although Ray really is the great  artist he says he is (according to one of the narrators he doesn't really  believe this), he doesn't really become the GREATEST until he  suffers.The jazz music is fabulous and typical of Woody's films.

I say &quot;lucky&quot; not only because this is an enjoyable and clever film, but because the film only played for a short while, and mainly in small &quot;arthouse&quot; theaters. This is really a shame, because &quot;Sweet and Lowdown&quot; could easily have appealed to wide audience, and not only to those who frequent Woody Allen films. This is the bittersweet tale of Emmett Ray, a fictional  depression-era jazz guitar legend who is cursed with an ego of truly IMMENSE proportions! Arrogant ol' Emmett would love you to believe that he is the greatest musician to ever strap on a guitar, but his love/hate relationship with real-life guitar legend Django Reinhardt gives us a hint of his underlying insecurity. Emmett, played with utter precision by Sean Penn, is the kind of self-worshiping, self-absorbed &quot;artist&quot; who walks all over those close to him without really noticing them. The flippant way in which Emmett treats the women in his life is downright disgraceful, and is sometimes even painful to watch thanks to Penn's expert acting. The story is told in a sort of PBS doumentary style, with several &quot;jazz experts&quot; (including Woody Allen as himself) providing much of the details of his life through on-camera interviews and voice over narration. The story follows the ups and downs (mostly downs) of Emmett's musical career and private life, and gives us both lighthearted comedy and subtle food-for-thought along the way. Emmett is a man completely out of touch with his own emotions, and the film realistically portrays the outworkings of an artistic ego running out-of-control. A highlight of &quot;Sweet and Lowdown&quot; is the stellar performance of British actress Samantha Morton as one of Emmett's put-upon lady friends, an all-too-understanding mute girl named Hattie. Morton lights up the screen with her unusual screen presence, and in the course of the story she wins us over with her genuine sweetness. (Was the title &quot;Sweet and Lowdown&quot; meant to refer to the unbalanced relationship between Hattie and Emmett?). As you would expect from a film written and directed by Woody Allen, the dialogue is sharp throughout, and the films visual style keeps the story moving forward in a positive way.

In fact, if it were not for his guitar playing, there is absolutely no reason why anyone would have any interest in him.  This character is a walking disaster.  To get near him emotionally is to be contaminated by toxic waste.

The answer in Sweet and Lowdown is an unequivocal &quot;No&quot;.  The problem for Sweet and Lowdown as a movie is that it is easy enough to see what a jerk Emmett Ray is.  However, since he is such a jerk, we do not care about him.  Moreover, if we don't care about him why we would bother to watch a movie about him?  I do not have an answer for that.

549834,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00004STRD,Matthew Horner,"[0, 1]","Director Woody Allen made 32 movies between 1966 and 1999. That's about one per year. He was young when his career took off; in fact, he was famous before he got behind the camera. The early days were remarkable, and he hit his peak in 1977 with Annie Hall which won four Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director. Since then he has received eleven more nominations and won one additional statuette. In 1972 he was lured to Hollywood to direct a big budget comedy called Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, which was a boxoffice hit but a critical bomb. Ever since, the director has stayed put in New York and made only small budget movies characterized by high profile stars, literate scripts, and stories generally centered around his phobias and obsessions. His movies quit making money in the 1990s because, I suspect, he and his style went out of fashion. Still, he remains one of America's great directors, and Sweet and Lowdown, while one of his more lightweight efforts, is a delightful treat.Sweet and Lowdown is the story of Emmett Ray [Sean Penn], the world's second best jazz guitarist 1930s. It unfolds in the style of a documentary, and, while everything is made up, Allen makes it so convincing that I know of one reviewer who fell for it and wrote as if Ray had been a real musician. Ray is a complex character, a true artist. He loves women, but they, along with everything else in this world, take a back seat to music, his one true love. He is reckless and impulsive. He drinks and gambles far too much. One day he meets a mute girl named Hattie [Samantha Morton]. It's love at first sight for her, although it's never clear if she's in love with him, his music or both. A compulsive talker, Emmett has much trouble dealing with her at first, but their relationship builds over time. He can't stand to be tied down. He eventually ditches her, only to realize later he really loves her. Later, Emmett marries Blanche [Uma Thurman], a sophisticated but batty writer who is constantly asking him why he is feeling what he is feeling. This drives him crazy, epescially since he never has an answer, and the marraige never stands a chance.Sean Penn, who claimed he was retiring from acting a decade ago, is remarkable as Emmett Ray. He learned the guitar from the musician who actually plays on the soundtrack, and he is so good at it that no trick shots were required. His body language in the movie says artistic type perpetually on the verge of a nervous breakdown. He's both amusing and sad to watch. Samantha Morton nearly steals the spotlight as Hattie. Since she plays a mute, she has no dialog. She expresses everything with her eyes and her expressions.There is drama in Sweet and Lowdown, but primarily it's a comedy, one of Allen's best recently.",4,Lightweigt Allen is still a comedic pleasure,1016496000,"03 19, 2002",2002,2790,"['Director', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'made', '32', 'movies', '1966', '1999', 'one', 'year', 'was', 'young', 'when', 'career', 'took', 'off', 'fact', 'was', 'famous', 'got', 'camera', 'early', 'days', 'were', 'remarkable', 'hit', 'peak', '1977', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'won', 'four', 'Oscars', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'then', 'received', 'eleven', 'more', 'nominations', 'won', 'one', 'additional', 'statuette', '1972', 'was', 'lured', 'Hollywood', 'direct', 'big', 'budget', 'comedy', 'called', 'Everything', 'Always', 'Wanted', 'Know', 'Sex', 'was', 'boxoffice', 'hit', 'critical', 'bomb', 'Ever', 'director', 'stayed', 'put', 'New', 'York', 'made', 'only', 'small', 'budget', 'movies', 'characterized', 'high', 'profile', 'stars', 'literate', 'scripts', 'stories', 'generally', 'centered', 'phobias', 'obsessions', 'movies', 'quit', 'making', 'money', '1990s', 'suspect', 'style', 'went', 'fashion', 'Still', 'one', 'America', 'great', 'directors', 'Sweet', 'Lowdown', 'one', 'more', 'lightweight', 'efforts', 'delightful', 'treat.Sweet', 'Lowdown', 'story', 'Emmett', 'Ray', '[', 'Sean', 'Penn', ']', 'world', 'second', 'best', 'jazz', 'guitarist', '1930s', 'style', 'documentary', 'everything', 'made', 'up', 'Allen', 'so', 'convincing', 'know', 'one', 'reviewer', 'who', 'fell', 'wrote', 'Ray', 'had', 'been', 'real', 'musician', 'Ray', 'complex', 'character', 'true', 'artist', 'women', 'everything', 'else', 'world', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'music', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'reckless', 'impulsive', 'gambles', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'One', 'day', 'mute', 'girl', 'named', 'Hattie', '[', 'Samantha', 'Morton', ']', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'never', 'clear', 'love', 'music', 'compulsive', 'talker', 'Emmett', 'much', 'trouble', 'dealing', 'first', 'relationship', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'be', 'tied', 'down', 'eventually', 'only', 'realize', 'later', 'really', 'Later', 'Emmett', 'Blanche', '[', 'Uma', 'Thurman', ']', 'sophisticated', 'batty', 'writer', 'who', 'constantly', 'asking', 'why', 'feeling', 'what', 'feeling', 'crazy', 'epescially', 'never', 'answer', 'marraige', 'never', 'chance.Sean', 'Penn', 'who', 'claimed', 'was', 'retiring', 'acting', 'decade', 'ago', 'remarkable', 'Emmett', 'Ray', 'learned', 'guitar', 'musician', 'who', 'actually', 'soundtrack', 'so', 'good', 'trick', 'shots', 'were', 'required', 'body', 'language', 'movie', 'artistic', 'type', 'perpetually', 'verge', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'amusing', 'sad', 'watch', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'nearly', 'spotlight', 'Hattie', 'mute', 'dialog', 'everything', 'eyes', 'expressions.There', 'drama', 'Sweet', 'Lowdown', 'primarily', 'comedy', 'one', 'Allen', 'best', 'recently']",N/A

His output, therefore, tends to fall into the major works (films like Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters, and Crimes and Misdemeanors, many of which have novelistic plots) and the minor ones (which tend to be more like short stories). Some of the minor films, like the recent Scoop, are so perfect in their own right, I'd rank them among his best work. Some of these movies, made one after the other, also tend to fulfill thematic arcs in Allen's career. In Deconstructing Harry, for instance, a writer who is a failed human being redeems himself through art. Shortly after that film, Allen made Sweet and Lowdown, about a musician who is a failed human being who redeems himself through his art. The film is one of those great minor works by Allen, even echoing the theme of Manhattan of a selfish man who realises the love of his life, but too late. (You snooze, you lose.)

Perhaps there was another Monet in our midst who, for whatever reason, was never noticed; who can say with any certainty there was not, or is not?  It's a consideration writer/director Woody Allen examines in his often humorous, and more often poignant, ""Sweet and Lowdown,"" starring Sean Penn and Samantha Morton.  In it, Allen chronicles the life of the fictitious Emmet Ray (Penn), who just may have been the second greatest guitar player in the world during the `30s.Allen employs the effective (in his hands) storytelling device of ""interviews"" with those who knew Ray in one capacity or another, to fill in the gaps as he attempts to draw a picture of this talented genius, about whom very little is really known.  Only a handful of recordings-- made during the final years-- remain of who and what Ray is, or was.  The portrait that comes into focus is that of a man, who though gifted as a musician, had a bit more trouble when it came to living his day to day life.  Self-centered, irresponsible and taken to drink, he was something of a lowdown character.  Then, one day in Atlantic City, Ray meets a sweet, young girl, Hattie (Morton), and they begin a relationship of sorts.  The problem is, Ray is a self professed free spirit, an artist, who goes where he wants and does what he wants.  Not exactly conducive to a sold relationship.  But inbetween, there's the music; and, as Ray himself will tell anyone who will listen, he's the best guitar player in the world, with the possible exception of this ""gypsy in France, ""-- Django Reinhardt.  And so, for your consideration, this is Emmet Ray-- the story of the man, and the woman who loved him.Told in his inimitable, signature style, Allen presents his fiction in humanistic terms that bring Emmet Ray and his times to life in transporting fashion.  He successfully captures the essence and ambience of the era, just as he did with ""Radio Days,"" in 1987.  This time period-- circa 1930-- is something of Allen's forte, in fact.  Few contemporary directors in even fewer films have managed to depict it so vividly and believably as Allen has here.  Through Ray, he takes you into the life itself, behind the scenes, as it were, and gives you a real sense of what these times were all about.  And, in conjunction with the interviews that lead to the flash-backs, it makes Ray seem as real as any figure in history you'd come to know through the respective media of film or print.  The story is engaging and devoid of pretense, and Allen tempers his own ego and presents it in a way that makes this one, arguably, one of his best films.Penn, who should have won an Oscar for his work in ""Dead Man Walking,"" received a Best Actor nomination for his portrayal of Emmet Ray, and deservedly so, though he was edged out by Kevin Spacey, who received the award for ""American Beauty"" that year (Russell Crowe was also in the running for ""The Insider""-- quite a year!).  There were no losers that year, however (as they say), as-- the award business aside-- Penn's performance is one of the most affecting of his career.  The Ray he presents is a total, well-rounded and three-dimensional character.  Watching him is like seeing the history of someone unfold before your eyes; not an actor, but a very real person, complete with every detail and flaw of his day to day existence.  It's terrific work that, with Allen's guidance, immerses you totally in the story and in Ray's life.As Hattie, Samantha Morton is like the second coming of Giulietta Masina; like Fellini's wife and star, she is wonderfully expressive and able to convey so much with a movement of her eyes or just a glance, so reminiscent of Masina's Gelsomina in ""La Strada.""  And though outwardly Hattie is fairly reserved, Morton leaves no doubt that within her there is need and desire, but with little expectation.  This is a young woman who is vulnerable and has known pain; someone with whom you readily empathize. When she hooks up with Ray, it quickly becomes a matter of concern, because you care for Hattie, and from the outset you realize that this relationship is going to be fragile, at best.  It's an inspired performance that landed Morton a nomination for Best Supporting Actress-- and she certainly deserved it (ultimately, it went to Angelina Jolie for ""Girl, Interrupted"").Uma Thurman turns in a memorable performance, as well, as Blanche, a writer who crosses paths with Ray and has a significant impact on his life.  Thurman makes Blanche credible, and she looks amazing, too.  The ""'30s"" look suits her extremely well, and cinematographer Zhao Fei (who did a magnificent job with this entire film) captures her best angles and achieves what just may be the best presentation of Thurman in any film yet.  It's a supporting, but pivotal role, and Thurman does it quite well.The supporting cast includes Anthony LaPaglia (Al Torrio), Dan Moran (Boss), Brian Markinson (Bill Shields), Tony Darrow (Ben), Gretchen Mol (Ellie), John Waters (Mr. Haynes), Brad Garrett (Joe Bedloe), Carolyn Saxon (Phyliss) and Molly Price (Ann).  When Woody Allen is ""on,"" his films are insightful and entertaining, and while subtle, are vibrantly alive.  All of which is the case with ""Sweet and Lowdown,"" in which he demonstrates-- his own personal neuroses notwithstanding-- his grasp and understanding of human nature-- what it is that underneath it all really makes people tick.  He's no Ingmar Bergman, but at his best, he's at least a reasonable facsimile.  And this IS on of his best.  It's the magic of the movies.",5,"Memorable Film, One of Allen's Best",1011657600,"01 22, 2002",2002,5804,"['history', 'especially', 'when', 'world', 'was', 'much', 'bigger', 'place', 'time',

549847,A13910TC3NZ6LE,B00004STRD,Sam Bethune,"[2, 4]","I've never been a big fan of Woody Allen's more mainstream movies, but I really liked this film.  Allen draws upon his knowledge of jazz to bring the life of fictional jazz guitarist Emmett Ray (the second greatest jazz guitarist in the world), and a completely irresponsible and idiosynchratic person.  Who else would take his dates to the dump to shoot rats?  Despite his considerable talent, Emmett lives in fear of his idol, the great Django Rheinhardt.  For those of you unfamiliar with jazz, Rheinhardt really existed and during his lifetime was one of the finest guitar players the world has ever known.Sean Penn, an actor who is sadly better known for his brief marriage to Madonna than for his considerable acting skills, turns in an Oscar-worthy performance as Emmett, playing him as a lovable but quirky and ultimately vulnerable character (Penn received an Oscar nomination for this portrayal, incidentally).  Uma Thurman appears briefly as Ray's socialite wife who marries him more out of curiosity than love.  Samantha Morton practically steals the movie away from Penn as the deaf-mute girlfriend who unconditionally loves him despite Emmett's inherent self-centeredness and lack of trustworthiness.  The director appears briefly explaining the life and times of Emmett in documentary style.  Although I didn't particularly care for this way of presenting the picture, it was at most a minor distraction.Whether you're a jazz afficianado or just appreciate an interesting character study, this motion picture is worth a look.",4,Something a Little Different from Woody Allen,983145600,"02 26, 2001",2001,1540,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'more', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'Allen', 'knowledge', 'jazz', 'bring', 'life', 'fictional', 'jazz', 'guitarist', 'Emmett', 'Ray', 'second', 'greatest', 'jazz', 'guitarist', 'world', 'completely', 'irresponsible', 'idiosynchratic', 'person', 'Who', 'else', 'would', 'take', 'dates', 'dump', 'shoot', 'rats', 'considerable', 'talent', 'Emmett', 'fear', 'idol', 'great', 'Django', 'Rheinhardt', 'unfamiliar', 'jazz', 'Rheinhardt', 'really', 'existed', 'lifetime', 'was', 'one', 'finest', 'guitar', 'players', 'world', 'ever', 'known.Sean', 'Penn', 'actor', 'who', 'sadly', 'better', 'known', 'brief', 'marriage', 'Madonna', 'considerable', 'acting', 'skills', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'Emmett', 'playing', 'lovable', 'quirky', 'ultimately', 'vulnerable', 'character', 'Penn', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'portrayal', 'incidentally', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'briefly', 'Ray', 'socialite', 'wife', 'who', 'more', 'curiosity', 'love', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'practically', 'movie', 'away', 'Penn', 'deaf-mute', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'unconditionally', 'Emmett', 'inherent', 'self-centeredness', 'lack', 'trustworthiness', 'director', 'explaining', 'life', 'times', 'Emmett', 'documentary', 'style', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'way', 'presenting', 'picture', 'was', 'most', 'minor', 'distraction.Whether', ""'re"", 'jazz', 'afficianado', 'just', 'appreciate', 'interesting', 'character', 'study', 'motion', 'picture', 'look']",N/A

549849,AJ9W09EUQPAKE,B00004STRD,Sirin,"[2, 2]","Sweet and Lowdown is a masterful film, only let down slightly by sagging in one or two places. Like most of Woody Allen's films, it is rich in comedy, albeit more subtle than some of his earlier efforts. It tells the story of Emmet Ray, the world's second best jazz guitarist in a fictional documentary style, with asides from Allen and others who comment on the protagonist's life. Jazz is one of Allen's consuming passions (as most people know, he is an accomplished clarinet player himself) and partially due to this he admits to a missing nostalgia for the 1930s, missing out on experiencing that period (Allen was born in 1935).Great art usually comes out of the artist's most personal passions, as a result, Allen reprises the era superbly: the locations, automobiles, jazz clubs, towns and parties are recreated in glorious warmth. The dialogue is sharp, honed down and witty so it slips down like a glass of bourbon. Sean Penn is superb as Emmet, the egotistical guitarist, who plays with a sprightly, engaged look of puzzlement on his face. He cares for no one except himself, 'look, I'm not the marrying sort, it leaves me cold'. Realising that girls go for arrogant, artistically gifted men, he uses his talents to manipulate women. That is, until he meets charming mute laundress, Hattie, who captivates him with her silence. After she makes an unlikely break into Hollywood, Emmet becomes jealous. In turn he leaves her, but realises he has blown his best chance of happiness, and his relationships with other, more intellectually inquisitive women lead to a downhill spiral in his life.This is a finely written character movie, the escapades of Emmet are brilliantly commented on by Allen, who, as ever, is sublime at parodying those wannabe tough intellectuals who pontificate on low life culture  - 'The thing with these emigre stories, you never know how much is made up...' and the acting is first rate througout. Allen does a fine job in producing a film about the perils of artistic genius, which is far superior to his attempt to do the same about Celebrity, in that other lousy epoymous film of his.",3,Masterful,1176940800,"04 19, 2007",2007,2121,"['Sweet', 'Lowdown', 'masterful', 'film', 'only', 'let', 'down', 'slightly', 'sagging', 'one', 'two', 'places', 'most', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'rich', 'comedy', 'more', 'subtle', 'earlier', 'efforts', 'story', 'Emmet', 'Ray', 'world', 'second', 'best', 'jazz', 'guitarist', 'fictional', 'documentary', 'style', 'asides', 'Allen', 'others', 'who', 'comment', 'protagonist', 'life', 'Jazz', 'one', 'Allen', 'consuming', 'passions', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'accomplished', 'clarinet', 'player', 'partially', 'due', 'missing', 'nostalgia', '1930s', 'missing', 'out', 'experiencing', 'period', 'Allen', 'was', 'born', '1935', '.Great', 'art', 'usually', 'artist', 'most', 'personal', 'passions', 'result', 'Allen', 'era', 'superbly', 'locations', 'automobiles', 'jazz', 'clubs', 'towns', 'parties', 'are', 'recreated', 'glorious', 'warmth', 'dialogue', 'sharp', 'honed', 'down', 'witty', 'down', 'glass', 'bourbon', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'superb', 'Emmet', 'egotistical', 'guitarist', 'who', 'sprightly', 'engaged', 'look', 'puzzlement', 'face', 'one', ""'m"", 'not', 'marrying', 'sort', 'cold', 'Realising', 'girls', 'go', 'arrogant', 'artistically', 'gifted', 'men', 'talents', 'manipulate', 'women', 'charming', 'mute', 'laundress', 'Hattie', 'who', 'silence', 'unlikely', 'break', 'Hollywood', 'Emmet', 'jealous', 'turn', 'blown', 'best', 'chance', 'happiness', 'relationships', 'other', 'more', 'intellectually', 'inquisitive', 'women', 'lead', 'downhill', 'spiral', 'life.This', 'finely', 'written', 'character', 'movie', 'escapades', 'Emmet', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'commented', 'Allen', 'who', 'ever', 'sublime', 'parodying', 'wannabe', 'tough', 'intellectuals', 'who', 'pontificate', 'low', 'life', 'culture', ""'The"", 'thing', 'emigre', 'stories', 'never', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'made', 'up', 'acting', 'first', 'rate', 'througout', 'Allen', 'fine', 'job', 'producing', 'film', 'perils', 'artistic', 'genius', 'far', 'superior', 'attempt', 'do', 'same', 'Celebrity', 'other', 'lousy', 'epoymous', 'film']",N/A

Period detail, period costumes, the music, the whole look and sound -- all are fine.  Nor is there necessarily anything wrong with the pseudo-documentary concept: the 1930s jazz-expert talking heads, including Woody Allen himself, who come on screen at transitional points and move the story along (including the neat three-ending trick).  No . . . the problem is in the writing, and Sean Penn, one of the finest actors of his generation, works hard to make his character, Emmett Ray, out of a bundle of tics -- the Django obsession, the pool, the train watching, the rat-shooting.  It doesn't work because finally there isn't a character there -- there's a cartoon sketch of the artist who is bad at everything but being an artist.  So the fault is Woody Allen's in his capacity as writer.  Penn's character has an oddball charm most of the time and is an oddball irritant at others.  Samantha Morton is Hattie, his mute girlfriend -- so one can't complain that the role is underwritten -- and she's effective and touching, though the attraction to Emmett isn't clear -- nor is the attraction later in the movie of Blanche (Uma Thurman), who is a one-trick pony here, as a tony girl who seems drawn to men who do unusual things well, like jazz guitar playing (Emmett) and killing people (Anthony LaPaglia as a club boss's enforcer).I think three stars is about right.  It's not difficult to watch, it looks good, and it's not too long, at about 90 minutes.  And there is the music.  In this respect the movie is a little bit like ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" which also has a self-absorbed musician at its center and a good look (though a different one, of course) and soundtrack.  Samantha Morton gives ""Sweet and Lowdown"" a bit more emotional pull than Carey Mulligan's character does for ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" but Llewyn, though one-dimensional, is less cartoonishly conceived than Emmett, and the scenes with his father and with the Chicago club owner have a gravity that nothing in ""Sweet and Lowdown"" does.
