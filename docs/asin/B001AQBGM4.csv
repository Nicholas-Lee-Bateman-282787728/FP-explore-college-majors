1166755,A85GHQYRQMC4T,B001AQBGM4,"Amazon Customer ""book junkie""","[0, 0]","The writers of Weeds took a big departure from the first three seasons, and in my opinion it is sooo much better.  I did enjoy the first three seasons, as I am a huge fan of Mary-Louise Parker (West Wing is good if you also enjoy her).  But this made the story a little more gritty and covered another side of the drug world.  It also touches on immigration from Mexico to the US.  I liked how the mention how terrible conditions are when coming across the border, how just because you are in the drug world doesn't mean you are not using the money for good, and once again just how rotten some people can be.  Interesting series, loving the new ""living in a border town"" theme!  And the finale.....!!!!!!!

1166756,A4064QHIQE96G,B001AQBGM4,"Andrew Thomson ""12 year amazon customer""","[13, 56]","A little note to those who don't want to read this type of critique:Please don't read it.Many of you have said that if I don't like racist TV I shouldn't watch the show.Well, if you don't like anti-racist reviews of light entertainment, then don't read this review.And to the person who says that I must be the racist, due to my focus and concerns about racial prejudice and stereotyping, please buy a dictionary, or just use a free one online and look up the word ""racism"".  While you are online look up some statistics about race equality or lack thereof in todays society, media, education, criminal justice, pollution, you name it, non-white people still get the short end of the stick in our society.  The facts don't lie.  Don't take my word for it, do your own research, and that includes hiring patterns in Hollywood, which is much more integrated than many parts of our society but still greatly under-represents minorities and presents them very unrealistically even compared to their unrealistic portrayals of white characters.As of season two this was certainly true of this show, though I believe unintentionally.I got sick of the stereotypes so I can't speak to it's current state.At last, more and more people are finally waking up from their hypnotic state and realizing just how atrociously bad this show is.The quiet elimination of the always-subservient African American characters after the first season was a sad and transparent effort to end the accusations of racist stereotyping that have plagued this show from the beginning.  While it was a relief to see the end of the portrayal of the Elder Black Woman as a classic ""Mammy"" character plucked directly from Hattie McDaniel's oscar winning pitch perfect minstrel show style performance in Gone With the Wind, firing the actors hardly solves the problem.  (My characterization of these minstrel era racist cliches should be taken literally, assuring Nancy repeatedly, ""Don't you worry your pretty little white a** about nothin' Mammy'll take care of everything"" or something to that effect, it's unbelievable I know, watch it and realize how sadly true this is)Tragically this effort to hide the unintentional racism of the show's all white creators was entirely unsuccessful, as each season seemed to introduce worse and worse examples of this early 20th century style vintage Hollywood racist stereotyping, this time with a nerdy and cowardly south Asian, and an incessant parade of lazy, violent, stupid, sexually insatiable Mexican characters.The ongoing and seemingly blindly unintentional implied racism of this show continues unabated.Every time I turn on the show I am shocked that it continues so nakedly.  I have not been able to stomach an entire episode in some years due to the deeply offensive racist stereotypes that seem to plague each and every episode of this show, who's high moral aspirations are betrayed by terrible writing and a vaguely defined premise that seems to continuously deteriorate even in the eyes of it's most ardent fans.Of interest to those who agree or disagree with my thesis here, is a fascinating and darkly revealing episode of the radio show and podcast ""The Treatment"" half hour interview with Jenji Cohan, the show's creator, a former writer for the Facts of Life and The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.There were two of these, and I am referring to the first one, with Jenji alone.  I have not heard the second one in which Jenji is joined by producer Roberto Benabib.When questioned by the well respected African American film critic Elvis Mitchell as to the ""Mammy"" character and whether the show is perpetuating outdated and negative stereotypes of African Americans, Jenji replies that the dialog of the African Americans is authentic, because she ""knows these people"" due to having spent at least one afternoon either playing dominos or watching games of dominos with some elderly ""black men"" at Venice Beach.For those who have not been there, Venice beach is far from the heart of Los Angeles' African American community.  Her amazing tale of cultural tourism into this world of authentically black people who play dominos on Venice Beach is to say the least unimpressive.  The crowds at Venice are somewhat integrated, certainly not usually completely all white, but always mostly all white.This defense was shamefully ignorant and shallow.  Elvis mercifully changed the subject, but I must say, that was one of those moments when I am ashamed to be white.  Go and listen for yourself at the KCRW fm internet archives, if you can stomach the ignorant and idiotic unintended racism.This show had so much potential, great premise, very topical issue, good cast, sufficient budget (it would seem), yet like so many Showtime endeavors, it came out malformed... a true television abomination.  Someone should make a good show on this subject some day.  I know I would watch it, but I can't stand this racist (and increasingly sexist, but don't get me started on that) expensive garbage.",1,"Many have now noticed how blatantly unintentionally racist

1166759,A391YPR0NFTCLK,B001AQBGM4,Brian,"[1, 4]","weeds is one of the best shows on television and its greatness continues with season 4. this is a slower season with the episode cliffhangers being more cerebral and character driven rather than shocking or thrilling as in the previous seasons. It is also a lot darker but also zanier than the others. When you watch this season more than once a lot of the troubles you have concerning the story arcs or the new direction will disappear. You will find that this was a logical step for each character and what they all go through seems natural for them, yes even Celia's story.

1166760,A2EO3TWW174F7P,B001AQBGM4,"Cameron Dimez ""GM Custom Jewelry Owner""","[0, 0]","I have been a fan of Weeds since it first premiered on Showtime and have been keeping up with the newest episodes religiously every Monday. Last season, Nancy got in some trouble with a gang of bikers, after escaping drug kingpin U-Turn's fat thumb only to burn down her house in an effort to flee leaving viewers to question ""what's going to happen next?""In a very unexpected turn of events, Nancy and family are heading to the fictional town of Ren Mar (Oceanside in reality), a small beachside town near the Mexican border. There, she follows Guillermo and begins her new occupation; trafficking across the Mexican border. Soon things evolve and spin out of control when Celia gets released from jail hellbent on incarcerating Nancy, Silas finds companionship in a much older woman, Shane is experiencing abnormal adolescent issues, and Andy as always is along for comedic relief and an occasional solution.The season starts out strong. By episode 3 the season has established it's new ""roots"". Ren Mar, not Agrestic. Mini-title sequences instead of ""Little Boxes"". And sadly, no Heylia, Conrad or Vaneeta, some of my favorite characters from previous seasons. Things start to pick up around episode 5 when tension starts to heat up between all characters.Overall, I believe this is a very strong season and would recommend it to anyone. It definitely took a darker, more mature tone on this season, much to some reviewers dislike, but I personally enjoyed the newfound darkness in the show. Drug dealing, while can be portrayed as comical obviously has a dark side that starts to show this season. Things are no longer fun and games in Agrestic, and there was a stir in the fanbase concerning the newer changes. I think they've paid off. I loved the idea of evolution and changing the shows entire premise in a dignified and plausible manner.Usually in my reviews I have the ""best and worst"" episodes. For this, it's tough because they're all pretty good. The only episode that disappointed me was the anti-climactic finale. Any TV watcher knows the main character isn't going to die. So, sorry Jenji, but that wasn't too big of a cliffhanger.Best episodes are:2. Ladies a CharmNancy engages in some potentially illegal activity, Bubbie says she wants to die, and Nancy begins to get deeper in the drug world.  A+5. No Man Is PuddingNancy and Celia work a bond out, after she knocks one of her teeth out. The search for missing Andy goes on. Meanwhile, Silas encounters an infestation and Nancy works out a deal with Captain Till to get her off her back.  A6. Excellent TreasuresCelia gets an unexpected visit from her estranged daughter, Shane auctions off all of Grandpa Lenny's furnishings, and Nancy gets way in over her head when she meets the man in the suit, senor Grande, Esteban Reyes. A7. Yes I CanIn this dynamic episode, Nancy gets her punishment for stepping out of line, moves 100 pounds of weed, Celia becomes a friend of the benzo's and decides to celebrate her newfound freedom to go on a xanax binge. Oh, and Shane... youch.  A8. I Am The TableSilas and Nancy each find new conquests, Guillermo gets put back in line, and Celia becomes an addict.  A+11. Head CheeseAfter an ayahuasca trip, Nancy begins to contemplate her newfound lifestyle. Meanwhile, after dodging Jered from Subway, Silas and Lisa make good work of their newfound cashcow.  A+12.

1166761,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B001AQBGM4,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[4, 4]","I really wanted to rate this 3 stars but in all honesty I've got to make it 4 stars.  This is because I keep telling myself that this show is stupid and ridiculous and only an idiot would watch it.  Then, of course, this idiot is there the following week taking in the newest episode after swearing that the week before was the last time with this show.  If I were not now watching the newest season, 5, in exactly the same way, I might be able to make myself believe that season 4 was no good but c'mon, even I'm not that thick.This is a bizarre season.  We leave suburbia for good with the usual cast of characters and take up residence near the Mexican border.  So Nancy now is living much more like an outlaw and no more like a soccer mom.  Nancy becomes involved with a Mexican drug lord and is as over her head as she was when she was involved with the rogue DEA agent. I have never really understood why Nancy had to go into dealing drugs as her employment when she found herself stranded in suburbia as a widowed soccer mom in season one but 4 seasons in, I've given up trying to understand any logic or reason to the characters in this show.Coming as no surprise is the character who has grown and grown with each season is her brother-in-law Andy (Justin Kirk).  I say this is no surprise because the two people on the show with substantial success in other (deeper) work are Kirk and Parker herself.  Kirk was the main character on both stage and screen for ANGELS IN AMERICA.  Parker also had a big part in ANGELS IN AMERICA.  That show walked off with just about all the Emmys the year it came out.  It was the poetic masterpiece about America in the time of AIDS.Celia (Elizabeth Perkins) remains the most witchy, caustic, non-mom, non-wife, non-worker in the show.  If everyone seems to fall in love with Nancy, they fall in hate with Celia.  She is the Nancy antidote.Shane as the bright kid who has to grow up in this bizarre environment, remains strong on the show.  As usual, he seems more like the parent to Nancy than the child.The other, usual characters from prior seasons seem more peripheral this time around.

Nancy (Mary Louise Parker) continues working for Guillermo (Guillermo Diaz), first by trafficking across the border and then by managing a maternity store that serves as a front for smuggling drugs and various other illegal things. Midway through the season, Nancy discovers that there's a tunnel in the floor of the store's back room that leads to Mexico. Her curiosity eventually gets the best of her, and she investigates the mysterious tunnel more thoroughly. She comes face to face with Guillermo's boss (Demian Bichir), who also happens to be the mayor of Tijuana, and Nancy ends up falling hard for him. However, when the federal government comes knocking on Nancy's door for information, she finds herself in a bit of a predicament.For me, Season 4 just wasn't as good as the previous seasons of the show. At first I was excited to see Nancy and her family in new surroundings, but I thought most of the season was pretty lackluster. There are some funny subplots including Celia's drug addiction, Silas's relationship with an older woman (Julie Bowen), Andy's coyote operation, and Doug's fixation with ""Mermax,"" an illegal immigrant. I also enjoyed watching Bichir on the show: he was an excellent addition to the cast this season.

1166784,A10CJINP7KBR4W,B001AQBGM4,M. Herzog,"[2, 2]","Weeds season 4 is a rather interesting beast in how dramatic a change the show has undergone.  No longer does the show revolve around the suburban mockings of a pot dealing soccer mom, but instead revolves around drug (among other things) trafficking.  While this season did feel fresh (let's be honest the idea was starting to get stale), it also kind of left me hating the main character.  While she has always been on the border of moral person trying to help her family, and immoral thrill seeker, this season really pushed her far beyond someone I care about.  Sure there's a few moments of morality, but the reality is they were forced.  Frankly, at this point, Nancy has consistently ignore her children, put them in danger, and raised a teenager who wants to do nothing but grow pot, with a young barely teenager having threesomes.So, with all of my complaints, why am I giving this a four stars?  Well, the show is still pretty funny, though I'm far more interested in Andy and Kevin Nealon's character than the botwin clan.  I liked where most of the stories went, but can't deny that I just don't feel for Nancy anymore.  Almost everytime she gets in trouble, its her fault.  She could've been out of the game time and time again, but she stays with it, not to help her family, but for her own thrills.  So if you can get past the complete lack of sympathy, they shows very entertaining.Oh yeah, and the blu ray looks great.",4,"Still funny, though the characters have gotten less interesting",1252886400,"09 14, 2009",2009,1435,"['Weeds', 'season', '4', 'rather', 'interesting', 'beast', 'how', 'dramatic', 'change', 'show', 'undergone', 'No', 'longer', 'show', 'revolve', 'suburban', 'mockings', 'pot', 'dealing', 'soccer', 'mom', 'instead', 'drug', 'other', 'things', 'trafficking', 'season', 'did', 'feel', 'fresh', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'idea', 'was', 'starting', 'get', 'stale', 'also', 'kind', 'left', 'hating', 'main', 'character', 'always', 'been', 'border', 'moral', 'person', 'trying', 'help', 'family', 'immoral', 'thrill', 'seeker', 'season', 'really', 'pushed', 'far', 'someone', 'care', 'Sure', 'few', 'moments', 'morality', 'reality', 'were', 'forced', 'Frankly', 'point', 'Nancy', 'consistently', 'children', 'put', 'danger', 'raised', 'teenager', 'who', 'do', 'nothing', 'grow', 'pot', 'young', 'barely', 'teenager', 'having', 'threesomes.So', 'complaints', 'why', 'am', 'giving', 'four', 'stars', 'Well', 'show', 'still', 'pretty', 'funny', ""'m"", 'far', 'more', 'interested', 'Andy', 'Kevin', 'Nealon', 'character', 'botwin', 'clan', 'liked', 'where', 'most', 'stories', 'went', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Nancy', 'anymore', 'Almost', 'trouble', 'fault', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'game', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'not', 'help', 'family', 'own', 'thrills', 'So', 'can', 'get', 'complete', 'lack', 'sympathy', 'shows', 'very', 'entertaining.Oh', 'yeah', 'blu', 'ray', 'great']",Weeds: Season 4

1166802,A3B26C1WRMBEAC,B001AQBGM4,Zoe Marr,"[33, 44]","Weeds, Season Four.The catchy theme song we all loved to sing along with while getting excited for the latest episode is gone, replaced by clever logos and an imaginative script. Too imaginative, to say the least. Remember when Nancy was a bad mother who at least tried to do well by her children? When Doug was always comedy gold, Celia was bitchy but loveable, and Shane was innocent? Sadly, those days are over, folks. Never have I seen a cast once so endearing transform into characters I wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole. Thank God for El Andy, who at least retains his charm and seems to be the only character winning over more audience love with time. Nancy Botwin is now officially a horrible person. One of the fascinations of this show was watching her balance that thin line between Suburbia and the Grasslands while juggling single parenthood. She was imperfect; a poor decision maker for sure, but at least she tried to bridge the gap between her growing(ly distant) sons. Her character has now officially all but given up any effort at all at maternal humanity. She goes through so many men that I've lost count and didn't have time to form any sort of attachment with any of those characters except Conrad, who despite all those seasons of subtle romantic build-up, all but disappears from this latest season. When did Doug become a grouchy demanding irritant? Wasn't he everyone's favorite member of Agrestic? By the way, whatever happened to Agrestic? Oh yeah. Up in flames like everything else in the series. Agrestic played such a central role in the series it was a character unto itself. No more. The Botwins now live by the seaside in Ren-Mar where they engage in plenty of acts that are anything but comical. Celia's character was initially written to be the next-door-neighbor, mother, and wife from hell (and the friend you should never double cross). Over the seasons, her character has melted into sheer terror. There is NOTHING funny about locking your ex-husband in a closet and abusing him. I'm pretty darn liberal when it comes to my sense of humor, but a lot of what is being pawned off as comedy is atrocious and completely amoral beyond belief, even for a TV show. I'm actually insulted that some of this is supposed to be laugh-worthy and frankly, disturbed by the implications. I guess the only realistic aspect of this show now is that Shane and Silas would find their way into the drug underworld relatively early in life given their upbringing. Even Guillermo nosedived into scary. This is certainly NOT the season I'd ever want to watch. The entire thing was blanketed in a darkness so thick and storylines so unpleasant I dare not purchase the season and will gladly forget it ever happened if Season Five can resurrect any shred of credibility to its mangled fate.
