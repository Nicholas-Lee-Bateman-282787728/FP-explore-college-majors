So, let's face it, Corey was never a gifted actor; he played cute, and that's all he was capable of playing.. By the time he got around to making Demolition U, Haim looked a little demented, trying to pass as a college jock. It could have been the drugs or whatever, but he was difficult to look at..maybe the eyebrows made him look that way.. This is just a further example of why his career fizzled out. His films became one low budget mess after the next. If you saw &#34;Blown Away&#34;, then you know what I mean; it was a lil weird watching him get it on and being the hero in an erotic thriller.. I know I felt a lil dirty watching it. Demolition U is no exception, it's really bad.Corey Haim was the child star who could no longer get work because there were no roles for &#34;high school kid in their 30's and 40's&#34;.. That's not to say that it's not too bad that he's gone, it is a tragic story.. We're around the same age and I grew up watching his films.. One progressively worse after the other .. So having made mostly crappy movies like this, it leaves you feeling meh..The only worthwhile thing in this is Robert Forester, who plays the sheriff. I believe he made this just before &#34;Jackie Brown&#34;.What's really sad and shameless is Echo Bridge Home Ent.,capitalizing off his death by making a gaudy DVD cover with just Haim  (in a pic that looks like it was taken in the 80's), clouds all around and it has &#34;Remembering The Teen Idol&#34; label.. VERY TACKY just to make a buck. Especially when there's no retrospective or anything on the disc, so again, TACKY.",2,Poor Corey Haim,1384646400,"11 17, 2013",2013,1655,"['had', 'heard', 'Demolition', 'High', 'not', 'Demolition', 'University..', 'So', 'let', 'face', 'Corey', 'was', 'never', 'gifted', 'actor', 'played', 'cute', 'was', 'capable', 'playing..', 'time', 'got', 'around', 'making', 'Demolition', 'U', 'Haim', 'looked', 'little', 'demented', 'trying', 'pass', 'college', 'jock', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'drugs', 'whatever', 'was', 'difficult', 'look', 'at..maybe', 'eyebrows', 'made', 'look', 'way..', 'just', 'further', 'example', 'why', 'career', 'fizzled', 'out', 'films', 'became', 'one', 'low', 'budget', 'mess', 'next', 'saw', '34', 'Blown', 'Away', '34', 'then', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'was', 'lil', 'weird', 'watching', 'get', 'being', 'hero', 'erotic', 'thriller..', 'know', 'felt', 'lil', 'dirty', 'watching', 'Demolition', 'U', 'exception', 'really', 'bad.Corey', 'Haim', 'was', 'child', 'star', 'who', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'get', 'work', 'were', 'roles', '34', 'high', 'school', 'kid', '30', '40', '34', 'not', 'say', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'gone', 'tragic', 'story..', ""'re"", 'same', 'age', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'films..', 'One', 'progressively', 'worse', 'other', '..', 'So', 'having', 'made', 'mostly', 'crappy', 'movies', 'feeling', 'only', 'worthwhile', 'thing', 'Robert', 'Forester', 'who', 'sheriff', 'believe', 'made', 'just', '34', 'Jackie', 'Brown', '34', '.What', 'really', 'sad', 'shameless', 'Echo', 'Bridge', 'Home', 'Ent.', 'capitalizing', 'off', 'death', 'making', 'gaudy', 'DVD', 'cover', 'just', 'Haim', 'pic', 'was', 'taken', '80', 'clouds', 'around', '34', 'Remembering', 'Teen', 'Idol', '34', 'label..', 'VERY', 'TACKY', 'just', 'make', 'buck', 'Especially', 'when', 'retrospective', 'anything', 'disc', 'so', 'again', 'TACKY']",N/A
