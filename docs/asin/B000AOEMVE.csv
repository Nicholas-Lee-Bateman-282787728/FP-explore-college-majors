929426,A2T689YVOAYGGD,B000AOEMVE,"Acontius ""Acontius""","[2, 2]","This series is fantastic.  Robert Carlyle nails the role of a village constable who knows when to look the other way.  And the villagers strictly mind their own business as they gossip constantly about each other.As the series progresses, some key characters evolve and become more interesting.  The romantic arc that spans the three seasons is quite moving, but be warned that along the way there are some tragedies.I'm not sure how I stumbled upon the series, but once I saw the first episode, I had to see them all.  That still wasn't enough, so I picked up Ms. Beaton's DEATH OF A GOSSIP, her first Hamish novel.  Yes, Hamish has redder hair and he's taller and lankier in the books, but the series enhanced the delight I'm experiencing as I read the books and find elements in them that were used here and there in the series.Shakespeare often took written works (fiction and history) and rearranged them to suit dramatized renderings.  This series is intensely character driven, and the ""mysteries"" seem to exist merely so we can enjoy Hamish and his beloved townsfolk.  It's his Zen-like, easy going way of dealing with life and death and the beauty of nature mixed with a razor sharp sense of humor that make him so magnetic to viewers and readers.Yes, the TV episodes mix up the novels' supporting characters and plots, but they play out well and are thoroughly enjoyable.  Addictive, almost!I'm on book 5 now.  I'll read more, and some day come back to enjoy Robert Carlyle bringing his take on Hamish to life again.Cheers!",4,Wonderful--and they drew me to the equally wonderful books,1231977600,"01 15, 2009",2009,1533,"['series', 'fantastic', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'role', 'village', 'constable', 'who', 'when', 'look', 'other', 'way', 'villagers', 'strictly', 'mind', 'own', 'business', 'gossip', 'constantly', 'other.As', 'series', 'key', 'characters', 'evolve', 'become', 'more', 'interesting', 'romantic', 'arc', 'three', 'seasons', 'quite', 'moving', 'be', 'warned', 'way', 'are', 'tragedies.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'stumbled', 'series', 'once', 'saw', 'first', 'episode', 'had', 'see', 'still', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'picked', 'up', 'Ms.', 'Beaton', 'DEATH', 'A', 'GOSSIP', 'first', 'Hamish', 'novel', 'Yes', 'Hamish', 'redder', 'hair', 'taller', 'lankier', 'books', 'series', 'enhanced', 'delight', ""'m"", 'experiencing', 'read', 'books', 'find', 'elements', 'were', 'used', 'here', 'there', 'series.Shakespeare', 'often', 'took', 'written', 'works', 'fiction', 'history', 'rearranged', 'suit', 'dramatized', 'renderings', 'series', 'intensely', 'character', 'driven', 'mysteries', 'seem', 'exist', 'merely', 'can', 'enjoy', 'Hamish', 'beloved', 'townsfolk', 'Zen-like', 'easy', 'going', 'way', 'dealing', 'life', 'death', 'beauty', 'nature', 'mixed', 'razor', 'sharp', 'sense', 'humor', 'make', 'so', 'magnetic', 'viewers', 'readers.Yes', 'TV', 'episodes', 'mix', 'up', 'novels', 'supporting', 'characters', 'plots', 'play', 'out', 'well', 'are', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'Addictive', 'almost', ""'m"", 'book', '5', 'now', ""'ll"", 'read', 'more', 'day', 'come', 'back', 'enjoy', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'bringing', 'take', 'Hamish', 'life', 'again.Cheers']",N/A
929427,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B000AOEMVE,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[0, 1]","This is a delightful series.  I had read many of the books by M. C. Beaton some time ago, but I don't recall enjoying them nearly as much as I do the TV series.  Like so many other murder mysteries, the Macbeth series surrounded a very troubled individual who never seems to progress.  Perhaps this is in fact the human condition--condemned never to learn from our own mistakes.Although the TV series shares some of the Macbeth self-immolation characteristic of the books, over all it seems to find some underlying goofiness, joy, and growth in the lives of its characters.  More than anything, I enjoy the stick-togetherness of the village people, the almost stop-action moments when even those who chronically disagree and argue will take up a cause in behalf of their opponent.  It strikes one like the old saying, ""I can fight with my brother, but nobody else can!""  The almost magic combination of silly insanity with stark tragedy and with death is very captivating.  It's like a roller coaster with emotions up and down and all around in the small space of one two hour episode.Series One seems to start in the middle of things.  Very little by way of introduction of characters is given, and the viewer is supposed to abstract the background details from the story as it progresses.  American TV series are very into giving the viewer absolutely everything they need to know about how the first situation arose, which makes us rather lazy.  From what I've seen of British TV series, the audience is expected to do their part, just as they are in legitimate theater (well, Shakespeare was born on the island, after all).  It's the difference between having a close friend introduce you to everyone in a small town, complete with personal background information and historical details, and moving into a new town, sight unseen, and having to learn as you go about everyone there.  Though it takes a little more effort than most Americans are used to when watching TV, it's definitely worth it.  The personal lives, foibles and mistakes of the central characters become the focus--and the contrast--to the deaths that take place around them, just as it does in the even more fascinating Midsomer Murder series,Midsomer Murders - The Early Cases Collection, another successful British TV series.My favorite of Series One is the episode The Great Lochdubh Salt Robbery.  Although it does very little to unearth the murder or the murderer until the very end, the very macabre finale is fantastic!  And the development of the regular characters is supurb.  Although it made me cry off and on throughout, Jock's Lament has a wonderfully developed plot that interweaves occult aspects with common human emotions in a way that I found both surprising and appealing--not to mention emotionally rejuvenating.",5,Another Quirky British Murder Mystery Series,1280361600,"07 29, 2010",2010,2804,"['delightful', 'series', 'had', 'read', 'many', 'books', 'M.', 'C.', 'Beaton', 'time', 'ago', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'enjoying', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'TV', 'series', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'Macbeth', 'series', 'surrounded', 'very', 'troubled', 'individual', 'who', 'never', 'progress', 'Perhaps', 'fact', 'human', 'condition', 'condemned', 'never', 'learn', 'own', 'mistakes.Although', 'TV', 'series', 'shares', 'Macbeth', 'self-immolation', 'characteristic', 'books', 'find', 'underlying', 'goofiness', 'joy', 'growth', 'lives', 'characters', 'More', 'anything', 'enjoy', 'stick-togetherness', 'village', 'people', 'almost', 'stop-action', 'moments', 'when', 'even', 'who', 'chronically', 'disagree', 'argue', 'will', 'take', 'up', 'cause', 'behalf', 'opponent', 'one', 'old', 'saying', 'can', 'fight', 'brother', 'nobody', 'else', 'can', 'almost', 'magic', 'combination', 'silly', 'insanity', 'stark', 'tragedy', 'death', 'very', 'captivating', 'roller', 'coaster', 'emotions', 'up', 'down', 'around', 'small', 'space', 'one', 'two', 'hour', 'episode.Series', 'One', 'start', 'middle', 'things', 'Very', 'little', 'way', 'introduction', 'characters', 'given', 'viewer', 'supposed', 'abstract', 'background', 'details', 'story', 'American', 'TV', 'series', 'are', 'very', 'giving', 'viewer', 'absolutely', 'everything', 'need', 'know', 'how', 'first', 'situation', 'arose', 'rather', 'lazy', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'British', 'TV', 'series', 'audience', 'expected', 'do', 'part', 'just', 'are', 'legitimate', 'theater', 'well', 'Shakespeare', 'was', 'born', 'island', 'difference', 'having', 'close', 'friend', 'introduce', 'everyone', 'small', 'town', 'complete', 'personal', 'background', 'information', 'historical', 'details', 'moving', 'new', 'town', 'sight', 'unseen', 'having', 'learn', 'go', 'everyone', 'there', 'little', 'more', 'effort', 'most', 'Americans', 'are', 'used', 'when', 'watching', 'TV', 'definitely', 'worth', 'personal', 'lives', 'foibles', 'mistakes', 'central', 'characters', 'become', 'focus', 'contrast', 'deaths', 'take', 'place', 'just', 'even', 'more', 'fascinating', 'Midsomer', 'Murder', 'series', 'Midsomer', 'Murders', 'Early', 'Cases', 'Collection', 'successful', 'British', 'TV', 'series.My', 'favorite', 'Series', 'One', 'episode', 'Great', 'Lochdubh', 'Salt', 'Robbery', 'very', 'little', 'unearth', 'murder', 'murderer', 'very', 'end', 'very', 'macabre', 'finale', 'fantastic', 'development', 'regular', 'characters', 'supurb', 'made', 'cry', 'off', 'Jock', 'Lament', 'wonderfully', 'developed', 'plot', 'occult', 'aspects', 'common', 'human', 'emotions', 'way', 'found', 'surprising', 'appealing', 'not', 'mention', 'emotionally', 'rejuvenating']",N/A

It's an odd mixture of the two, with a dash of soap opera, featuring a lot of Scottish scenery and a handful of characters who inhabit a single community somewhere north of Inverness.  The hero is a policeman who is very human, and even breaks the law to protect his friends and defend his manhood.  (An outsider mocks his name, so Hamish--twice--kicks in the headlights of the man's expensive car.  Then, at about 125 pounds, he thrashes the larger bad guy.)  Other characters in the series are only mildly entertaining when intelligible; some of their dialogue is lost thanks to heavy Scottish accents.  The first two episodes are especially weak.  The last two are quite good, the best being ""Wee Jock's Lament.""  So, it's a matter of taste.

He is quite an unusual policeman as he works hard all the time not to get the big guys from Inverness involved.  The impact of that being that he actually helps the locals slide under the law at times.  This is a BBC series that had a lot of promise, but in my humble opinion, the writers almost got it, but not quite.  They didn't seem to know how to handle the love story. As Alex who is an aspiring writer is presented at first as quite an unlikeable girl, but then it doesn't make sense why Hamish is so crazy about her.  And then the third member of the love triangle is Isobel and she at first is quite likeable but then they give her an attitude that makes one root for Alex.  The ending of this first of the the three series is quite a cliffhanger.  Not being accustomed to the Scottish Brogue, we had to use the subtitles to fully understand everything that was being said.

It is just too laid back to be interesting. M.C. Beaton has also written many books featuring her detective Agatha Raisin.  Her character would make a very interesting series.  Perhaps the company that produces the Hamish McBeth series should also consider beginning one that features Agatha Rasin. M.C. Beaton has written more Agatha Raisin mysteries than ones featuring Hamish MacBeth. I do not want to be negative about this series but I think that changing M.C. Beaton's plot lines is not the way to produce this series.",3,A good series but lacks authenticity,1161043200,"10 17, 2006",2006,1249,"['enjoyed', 'DVD', 'very', 'much', 'However', 'avid', 'reader', 'M.C', 'Beaton', 'books', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'seen', 'series', 'follow', 'books', 'more', 'closely', 'Wee', 'Jock', 'adorable', 'dog', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'M.C', 'Beaton', 'Towser', 'shown', 'Hamish', 'dog', 'lovable', 'mutt', 'whom', 'Hamish', 'cooks', 'who', 'Hamish', 'investigations', 'series', 'interesting', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'M.C', 'Beaton', 'actual', 'murder', 'plots', 'were', 'followed', 'really', 'what', 'books', 'difficult', 'put', 'down', 'think', 'DVD', 'been', 'done', 'very', 'nicely', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'perfect', 'Hamish', 'scenery', 'spectacular', 'series', 'plot', 'lines', 'make', 'want', 'continue', 'watching', 'just', 'too', 'laid', 'back', 'be', 'interesting', 'M.C', 'Beaton', 'also', 'written', 'many', 'books', 'featuring', 'detective', 'Agatha', 'Raisin', 'character', 'would', 'make', 'very', 'interesting', 'series', 'Perhaps', 'company', 'Hamish', 'McBeth', 'series', 'should', 'also', 'consider', 'beginning', 'one', 'Agatha', 'Rasin', 'M.C', 'Beaton', 'written', 'more', 'Agatha', 'Raisin', 'mysteries', 'ones', 'featuring', 'Hamish', 'MacBeth', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'negative', 'series', 'think', 'changing', 'M.C', 'Beaton', 'plot', 'lines', 'not', 'way', 'produce', 'series']",N/A

It does not. (There is a subtle caveat at the beginning of each episode: &#8220;Based on characters created by M. C. Beaton.&#8221; I gather from the reviews of those who have read the books in question that this statement is equivalent to, &#8220;any similarity to M. C.

Judd ""brothersjudddotcom""","[17, 18]","The Wife and I are big on British mysteries on TV and have been working our way through the whole Midsomer Murders series via Netflix. So when the Recommendations feature popped up the intriguing sounding Hamish MacBeth -- starring Robert Carlyle, who has a great star turn as a psychotic soccer fan in the original Cracker -- it seemed worth a try. (Of particular note is that several episodes are directed and/or written by Danny Boyle, with whom Carlyle later made Trainspotting.)The series turns out to be a delightfully idiosyncratic concoction, sort of reminiscent of Local Hero, but with Carlyle playing a Scottish police constable who disguises his own ability from his superiors in order to avoid promotion and get to stay in the quirky seaside town of Lochdubh. There he watches over the oft-times larcenous doings of the inhabitants and tries to keep them out of trouble, protecting them from both the law and genuine evil-doers. Carlyle gives us a MacBeth of appealing emotional fragility -- especially where his dog, Wee Jock, and the not-always-requited love of his life, Alexandra MacLean, are concerned. It's very amusing, though the last two episodes of Season One took a darker turn and left us with an emotion-wrenching cliff-hanger.The books, at least the first two (I found a British edition that contained both), feature a tougher and more devious MacBeth -- who poaches and conducts other schemes in order to send money home to his large family -- making them enjoyable in a different way. His sidekick, TV John, is also missing and rather than Alex he loves a Priscilla Halburton-Smythe.Books or series, you won't be sorry either way.",5,"BOOK, CD, DVD--THEY'RE ALL GREAT:",1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,1658,"['Wife', 'are', 'big', 'British', 'mysteries', 'TV', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'way', 'whole', 'Midsomer', 'Murders', 'series', 'Netflix', 'So', 'when', 'Recommendations', 'feature', 'popped', 'up', 'intriguing', 'sounding', 'Hamish', 'MacBeth', 'starring', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'who', 'great', 'star', 'turn', 'psychotic', 'soccer', 'fan', 'original', 'Cracker', 'seemed', 'try', 'particular', 'note', 'several', 'episodes', 'are', 'directed', 'and/or', 'written', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'whom', 'Carlyle', 'later', 'made', 'Trainspotting', 'series', 'out', 'be', 'delightfully', 'idiosyncratic', 'concoction', 'sort', 'reminiscent', 'Local', 'Hero', 'Carlyle', 'playing', 'Scottish', 'police', 'constable', 'who', 'own', 'ability', 'superiors', 'order', 'avoid', 'promotion', 'get', 'stay', 'quirky', 'seaside', 'town', 'Lochdubh', 'oft-times', 'larcenous', 'doings', 'inhabitants', 'tries', 'keep', 'trouble', 'protecting', 'law', 'genuine', 'evil-doers', 'Carlyle', 'MacBeth', 'appealing', 'emotional', 'fragility', 'especially', 'where', 'dog', 'Wee', 'Jock', 'not-always-requited', 'love', 'life', 'Alexandra', 'MacLean', 'are', 'concerned', 'very', 'amusing', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'Season', 'One', 'took', 'darker', 'turn', 'left', 'emotion-wrenching', 'cliff-hanger.The', 'books', 'least', 'first', 'two', 'found', 'British', 'edition', 'contained', 'feature', 'tougher', 'more', 'devious', 'MacBeth', 'who', 'other', 'schemes', 'order', 'send', 'money', 'home', 'large', 'family', 'making', 'enjoyable', 'different', 'way', 'sidekick', 'TV', 'John', 'also', 'missing', 'rather', 'Alex', 'Priscilla', 'Halburton-Smythe.Books', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sorry', 'way']",N/A
