fun.from the frog who acted out a tragic love story for juliette and on.there were quite a few important people involved in this.ozzy osbourne did the rein deers voice and on an internet ad,hulk hogans voice advertised a really mean looking lawn mower.there were a few questionable things  said and done.there were a few sexual innuendos but nothing children should pick up on.another time a guy says ""insane in the brain"" which is a reference to a cypress hill song about marijuana.another time they steal a mans underwear.personaly,i wouldve gone PG.THERE were a lot of funny things too which heavily out weighed the bad.when juliette was getting ready for her date with gnomeo,they used duct tape to shave her legs.there was a mexican flamingo in an english story.it was out of place but ended up being important to the story.i wonder how many mexican movies put in white guys just to make them feel better.none i bet.there were also a few ""forrest gump"" references like ""run gnomeo run"" and ""i may not be a smart bird but i know what love is"".for those of you who are extra perceptive and imaginative,you may see a dragon on juliettes dads hat.remember,i did use the word ""imaginative"".being as how,the guy from ""elf"" played as a demi-human elf which is like a gnome in many ways,it seems appropriate that he was the screen saver on the internet.i never thought i'd see the internet on a ""romeo and juliette"" movie but the times they are a changing.[that was my cameo from medal of freedom winner bob dylan""]even with ozzy osbourne,elton john,cypress hill,hulk hogan,romeo,juliette,forrest gump,the and the elf,they still found time to squeeze in a hilarious bit with old shakespere himself.it was classic!juliettes mom throws in ""unleash the dogs of war"" which is actualy a misquote.its actualy ""wreak havoc and let slip the dogs of war"".there is a battle,but i assure you,its done as very,very silly and funny.some of the stuff in the ""toy story"" trilogy was way worse.this movie is fun for adults too.so dont plan on being bored.plan on being entertained.there are a LOT of jokes that are slipped in there cleverly.they are for someone who knows the story or is simply older than the targeted age group.and finaly,i was wondering the whole time how they were going to make a G RATED ending out of this.it WAS a tragedy ending in a double suicide.im pretty sure nearly everyone if not the whole cast was killed in shakesperes version.but,they killed bambis mom didnt they?dont worry!its a nice and innocent ending for everyone.i say buy it.its absolutely charming!",5,I LOVED IT!,1338422400,"05 31, 2012",2012,2704,"['i', 'went', 'thinking', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'silly', 'be', 'entertaining', 'especialy', 'G', 'rating', '.but', 'i',

(As opposed to every Dreamworks animated movie ever made.)As you probably already know from the ubiquitous commercials, it's a modern retelling of Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet, featuring a cast of garden gnomes that live in the back gardens of two semi-detached homes in Verona Court, Stratford-on-Avon. Where the more usual animated movies have jokes about whoever has a show on Bravo or E! this week, Gnomeo substitutes random Shakespeare references -- Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Movers, As You Like It; mostly titles and bits of Hamlet, actually, since those are the most likely to get a spark of recognition -- and that works pretty well for those of us who are moderately Shakespeare-savvy. (Those completely innocent of Shakespeare won't get any of it, and serious Romeo & Juliet scholars will probably be annoyed from beginning to end at the liberties.)James MacAvoy is Gnomeo, from the Blues, and Emily Blunt is Juliet, daughter of Lord Redbrick. And the plot follows Romeo & Juliet about as well as an Elton John-produced movie for kids about lawn furniture would. It's not a movie for the ages, but it's a decent family movie for this week or this year, and there will be a minor but fervent cult surrounding it in random dorm rooms around the English-speaking world in about twelve years.",3,Better than it had to be,1303171200,"04 19, 2011",2011,1554,"['first', 'movie', 'Wheeler', 'family', 'saw', 'gestalt', 'entity', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'non-stupid', 'GNOMEO', 'JULIET', 'decent', 'animated', 'movie', 'solidly', 'aimed', 'kids', 'manages', 'entertain', 'parents', 'pandering', 'opposed', 'Dreamworks', 'animated', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'ubiquitous', 'commercials', 'modern', 'retelling', 'Shakespeare', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'featuring', 'cast', 'garden', 'gnomes', 'live', 'back', 'gardens', 'two', 'semi-detached', 'homes', 'Verona', 'Court', 'Stratford-on-Avon', 'Where', 'more', 'usual', 'animated', 'movies', 'have', 'jokes', 'whoever', 'show', 'Bravo', 'E', 'week', 'Gnomeo', 'random', 'Shakespeare', 'references', 'Rosencrantz', 'Guildenstern', 'Movers', 'mostly', 'titles', 'bits', 'Hamlet', 'actually', 'are', 'most', 'likely', 'get', 'spark', 'recognition', 'pretty', 'well', 'who', 'are', 'moderately', 'Shakespeare-savvy', 'completely', 'innocent', 'Shakespeare', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'serious', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'scholars', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'annoyed', 'beginning', 'end', 'liberties', 'James', 'MacAvoy', 'Gnomeo', 'Blues', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'Juliet', 'daughter', 'Lord', 'Redbrick', 'plot', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'as', 'well', 'Elton', 'John-produced', 'movie', 'kids', 'lawn', 'furniture', 'would', 'not', 'movie', 'ages', 'decent', 'family', 'movie', 'week', 'year', 'will', 'be', 'minor', 'fervent', 'cult', 'surrounding', 'random', 'dorm', 'rooms', 'English-speaking', 'world', 'twelve', 'years']",N/A

It looked really cute and colorful and vibrant and energetic and just a total distraction, which is what I was hoping for.  Instead, I got something remarkably bland in moments, boring almost, that didn't add enough variance to create something special.  This is sad, because this really could have become something truly epic; instead it settled for mediocre.  That isn't to say that the film doesn't have some merit.  The voice work is nicely played by the entire cast, and that Elton John/Lady Gaga original song (Hello, Hello) is fun and plays at the right moment to create a dash of charisma, but in the end this film fails to live up to my expectations (which were, arguably, too high).

1408796,A3LPA9D5IOQ1XY,B004HO6HXY,Ashley Billings,"[7, 9]","Gnomeo and Juliet is a computer-animated kids comedy produced by Baker Bloodworth and directed by Kelly Asbury, and featuring music from Elton John.  It is based on the tragic play by William Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet.  Featuring the voice talents of James McAvoy, Emily Blunt, Michael Caine, Jason Statham, Maggie Smith, Ashley Jensen, Matt Lucas, Patrick Stewart, Ozzy Osbourne, Jim Cummings, Hulk Hogan and more.Plot:  The movie takes place in the modern day gardens of the Capulet and Montague families.  In their gardens they have tons of of cute little lawn gnomes running around, who hate each other, and are separated by their colors, red and blue.  Our main characters are Gnomeo(James McAvoy) a blue gnome, and Juliet(Emily Blunt) a red gnome.  After the blues and reds have a lawnmower race with Gnomeo and Tybalt(Jason Statham) as the racers.  Tybalt ends up cheating and causes Gnomeos lawnmower to get destroyed.  Gnomeo plots revenge and decides to sneak into the reds garden at nightfall.  at the same time Juliet is plotting to go on top of a greenhouse out in the distance that holds a beautiful flower at the very top.  Gnomeos plan goes awry and he takes off towards the greenhouse to try to escape the reds he sees somone running towards the flower and he chases after the and grabs the flower right as Juliet reaches for it.  The two fight over the flower and end up falling for each other in the process, when they discover that they are actually supposed to be enemies they are shocked.  The two lovebirds decide to meet at a secret garden at certain times to profess their love to one another.  While at this garden they meet an eccentric pink flamingo named featherstone, who had his lovebird taken away from him and was locked in a shed for 20 years.  The flamingo teaches them they can't let anyone stand in the way of their love and they have to fight for their right to be together.  But it's up to Gnomeo and Juliet to pull it off.My Thoughts:  As soon as I heard of this movie, I thought of my girlfriend who loves gnomes and I thought this would be perfect for us to go see, and when I heard it featured the music of Elton John I knew it would be a good one, let us not forget he was involved in the Lion King.  This movie didn't disappoint, The gnomy characters are very well animated nad the movie is full of vibrant colors.  The interactions between the gnomes is very well done also.  The only complaints I have is that I was expecting maybe kind of a musical thing, since the movie featured music by Elton John, and had so many famous actors in the movie, why couldn't Elton John play a role, and make up some songs to go along with it.  That would have made it even better, but even though Elton didn't play a character like I was hoping, I still thoroughly enjoyed it and I think it is mainly for kids but many adults will enjoy it too.  I think it is worth a buy and not just a rent.",5,What's in a gnome?,1302739200,"04 14, 2011",2011,2928,"['Gnomeo', 'Juliet', 'computer-animated', 'kids', 'comedy', 'produced', 'Baker', 'Bloodworth', 'directed', 'Kelly', 'Asbury', 'featuring', 'music', 'Elton', 'John', 'based', 'tragic', 'play', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'Featuring', 'voice', 'talents', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Ashley', 'Jensen', 'Matt', 'Lucas', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Ozzy', 'Osbourne', 'Jim', 'Cummings', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'more.Plot', 'movie', 'place', 'modern', 'day', 'gardens', 'Capulet', 'Montague', 'families', 'gardens', 'have', 'tons', 'cute', 'little', 'lawn', 'gnomes', 'running', 'around', 'who', 'hate', 'other', 'are', 'separated', 'colors', 'red', 'blue', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'Gnomeo', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'blue', 'gnome', 'Juliet', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'red', 'gnome', 'blues', 'reds', 'have', 'lawnmower', 'race', 'Gnomeo', 'Tybalt', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'racers', 'Tybalt', 'up', 'cheating', 'Gnomeos', 'lawnmower', 'get', 'destroyed', 'Gnomeo', 'plots', 'revenge', 'decides', 'sneak', 'reds', 'garden', 'nightfall', 'same', 'time', 'Juliet', 'plotting', 'go', 'top', 'greenhouse', 'out', 'distance', 'beautiful', 'flower', 'very', 'top', 'Gnomeos', 'plan', 'awry', 'towards', 'greenhouse', 'try', 'escape', 'reds', 'somone', 'running', 'flower', 'grabs', 'flower', 'right', 'Juliet', 'reaches', 'two', 'fight', 'flower', 'end', 'up', 'falling', 'other', 'process', 'when', 'discover', 'are', 'actually', 'supposed', 'be', 'enemies', 'are', 'shocked', 'two', 'lovebirds', 'decide', 'meet', 'secret', 'garden', 'certain', 'times', 'profess', 'love', 'one', 'garden', 'meet', 'eccentric', 'pink', 'flamingo', 'named', 'featherstone', 'who', 'had', 'lovebird', 'taken', 'away', 'was', 'locked', 'shed', '20', 'years', 'flamingo', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'anyone', 'stand', 'way', 'love', 'have', 'fight', 'right', 'be', 'together', 'up', 'Gnomeo', 'Juliet', 'pull', 'off.My', 'Thoughts', 'As', 'soon', 'heard', 'movie', 'thought', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'gnomes', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'go', 'see', 'when', 'heard', 'featured', 'music', 'Elton', 'John', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'one', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'was', 'involved', 'Lion', 'King', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'gnomy', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'animated', 'movie', 'full', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'interactions', 'gnomes', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'also', 'only', 'complaints', 'have', 'was', 'expecting', 'maybe', 'kind', 'musical', 'thing', 'movie', 'featured', 'music', 'Elton', 'John', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'famous', 'actors', 'movie', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'Elton', 'John', 'play', 'role', 'make', 'up', 'songs', 'go', 'along', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'even', 'better', 'even', 'Elton', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'character', 'was', 'hoping', 'still', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'think', 'mainly', 'kids', 'many', 'adults', 'will', 'enjoy', 'too', 'think', 'buy', 'not', 'just', 'rent']",N/A

Or at least that was the sales pitch for this computer animated oddity.  The work of the Bard only serves as a vague inspiration for this super-cutesy tale of two young lovers kept apart by their feuding families (rival bands of garden gnomes living in two kooky neighboring British gardens...)  After this starting point, the filmmakers go off on goofy tangents that have more to do with bringing to life the small-scale worlds of these little yard-dwellers... But unlike, say, Pixar's ""Toy Story,"" there's little happening in the plot to make these animated inanimate objects seem particularly interesting.  The plot seems forced, as does the humor, replacing kinetic energy and high decibel levels for actual wit.  This was a passable, relatively kid-friendly way to spend an afternoon, but it didn't stick to the ribs.

I also like that Gnomio and Juliet actually have time to fall in love and getting to know each other instead of falling head over heals at first sight. Its a great movie for kids adults and teens to watch. I admit I had a feeling I was going to like it. But I didn't think I would love it as much as I do now.

It is an adorable movie with great Disney animation!  The movie features two neighbors caught in a feud, one has the red gnomes and the other blue.  The gnomes compete and go against each other until Gnomeo & Juliet make them realize that blues can exists with reds!  It is about the classic Romeo & Juliet story, but with a cute Disney twist.  I laughed and replayed parts, especially the one where the gnome looks and sings like Elton John!  I love the 2-Disc Blu-Ray pack because it comes with a Blu-ray disc for my house and the DVD which is great to keep in the car for that DVD player!  The cast voices are from some great celebrities (Ozzy Osborne, Dolly Parton, Hulk Hogan James Mcavoy and more!) and the music is great of course since it includes Elton John!  I can definitely see us watching this movie over and over and love that it is something different - I mean how could you not like a movie about gnomes!

If I had my way, I would show my son every classic movie that I love, but his attention span just is not there yet. Next to a classic movie, I guess a family cartoon is the next best thing. One great cartoon that I recommend - and I have seen six times now is the movie Gnomeo And Juliet. It is the first movie my son pretty much sat through.Gnomeo & Juliet is a 2011 British computer-animated family comedy film based on William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. The film is directed by Kelly Asbury, and the two main characters are voiced by James McAvoy and Emily Blunt. Gnomeo & Juliet is directed by Kelly Asbury. The original screenplay, inspired by William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, was written by John R. Smith and Rob Sprackling. Asbury, Mark Burton, Kevin Cecil, Emily Cook, Kathy Greenberg, Andy Riley, and Steve Hamilton Shaw worked on the final screenplay. Prior to the casting of James McAvoy and Emily Blunt, the roles of Gnomeo and Juliet were to be voiced by Ewan McGregor and Kate Winslet, respectively. In addition, this film reunites veteran British actors Maggie Smith and Michael Caine, from the 1978 Neil Simon comedy California Suite, in the roles of Lady Blueberry and Lord Redbrick, respectively.The film was the original idea of Sprackling and Smith, who sold the spec script to Disney through Rocket Pictures. Initially, the film was going to be produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios, but was shut down by its new chief, John Lasseter, after the Pixar acquisition. Miramax Films picked up the project and guided its production until the division closed down. Australian director Adam Elliot was approached and asked to direct the film, but he rejected the offer due the film's incompatibility with his style, as well as his lack of experience with CGI. The film later was picked up and produced by Starz Animation in Toronto. It was released under the Touchstone Pictures banner on February 11, 2011, becoming Touchstone's first animated film since 1993's The Nightmare Before Christmas and also Touchstone's first film to receive a G rating from the MPAA.I want to admit something here as well.

Cute and odd garden gnomes come to life when people aren't looking and they have a (familiar) feud wherein two gnomes on opposite sides fall in love.  Of course, it couldn't end like the tragic original tale...but it could have been done better.  Way better.The animation was good, but the plot was ho-hum.  And it wasn't all because they had to give it a happy ending.  I usually enjoy animated kid's movies, but this one fell flat.  There weren't enough funny parts, the action was obvious, and I couldn't care about the characters.  Juliet was marginally cool when she was taking charge of her life, but Gnomeo was pretty unlikeable all round.  The best character was the sad pink flamingo and even that became annoying by the end.The movie could have been given more of an edge and yet not gone over the edge.  What about the human owners of the two gardens--why was there no focus on how that reflected on the battle between the gnomes of the two gardens.  Perhaps, they could have been former sweethearts or fell in love as Gnomeo & Juliet did?  A tragic death scene that reflects the original could have been done...with a twist.  The writers seems rather underinspired, or perhaps they think that kids don't deserve more?This movie doesn't hold a candle to great kid's movies like The Incredibles, Monsters Inc, Toy Story, and Shrek.

In the case of Gnomeo and Juliet, the story becomes one of lawn gnomes, the ""red"" and ""blue"" groups who live next door to each other in a British suburb.Lawn gnomes and gardening are popular in the U.S. to be sure, but their is a significant passion and pride in gardens that is decidedly English. That doesn't mean Americans won't ""get it;"" and as a matter of fact, the film was a surprise box office hit domestically. Just pointing out that the tone, comedy and the cast is predominately English, which suits Anglophiles like me just fine.It's a very funny film, not so much an animated film in the Disney Cinderella sense than in the Disney Jungle Book sense -- a collection of funny set pieces arranged around a simple storyline with some tender moments here and there. The film was released under the Touchstone banner rather than Disney, perhaps because it doesn't follow the Disney mold in general and contains a few naughty bits, like the one gnome who runs around in a Borat-like swimsuit.Overall, it's a charming, witty romp, beautifully designed and executed (though I kind of liked the second alternate ending better than the one that was used).The voice cast is excellent, but the stars are really the Elton John/Bernie Taupin hits that complement the story, including two superb new songs (John himself appears in a bonus feature). The songs don't seem clumsily shoehorned into the story as an excuse to use them; they fit remarkably well.Sir Elton was reportedly miffed that the film was not given what he perceived as sufficient support, yet it did quite well anyway. I can't help wondering how much more of a sensation it would have been had it been released shortly after The Lion King, which would have capitalized on the new renown for Elton John and when his music catalog was at the perfect age for nostalgia and the fascination each generation has with whatever was popular two decades before it).",4,"Wherefore art thou, Gnomeo?

1408843,A6X6LNZO1C3EZ,B004HO6HXY,J. Munyon,"[0, 1]","You know how SOME animated films are enjoyable for the little kids in the audience but still keeps some elements in the film to also entertain the adults too?  ""Gnomeo & Juliet"" absolutely, unequivocally, definitely, comprehensively, assuredly, exhaustively, concretely is NOT one of those.  Even if you know the Shakespeare story of the Montagues versus the Capulets and how Romeo and Juliet's forbidden love ended tragically, the different ending on this latest animated re-interpretation won't entertain you as an adult.  Jason Statham is one of the familiar voices, whereas James McAvoy (Gnomeo) and Emily Blunt (Juliet) are not so familiar.  The film has many Shakespeare references beyond the immediate theme, and other voices familiar include Michael Caine, Maggie Smith, and Patrick Stewart.  Elton John being the executive producer, it then is no surprise the soundtrack has several Elton John songs.  Hulk Hogan's voice is given to a lawn mower, Ozzie Osbourne is the voice for a fawn (young forest ruminant), and a handful of other Hollywood notables lend their voices as well - yet it doesn't redeem this film beyond the juvenile marketing theme throughout the picture.  On the other hand, on opening weekend (mid Feb 2011) the box office take was over $25M, and by June 2011 this movie had earned $99.7M at the box office.  Now it has been released on DVD.  If you have kids, some of the really younger under 4 children may be frightened by the lawnmower race and then later in the show there is an even more intimidating ""Terrafirminator"" that at first is thought to have killed two of the gnomes in a rip roaring path of wanton destruction.  The rest of the film is like caramel topping on ice cream, with honey added.  Touchstone, Rocket, and Miramax are the companies behind this animated piece, but Walt Disney wouldn't have changed a thing.  Look for two elements most people miss - the laptop computer is not an Apple, but has a banana logo on it; and, on the bus that goes by the bus stop in front of Gnomeo and the flamingo character, the placard on the side of the bus says ""Stratford-Upon-Avon"" which was the home of William Shakespeare (the famous playwright whose story this film is based on).

Excellent animation.. a lot of movement and the garden gnomes were surprisingly accurate and funny to watch.  A lot of color.. bright, sunny days, moonlight.. and a good story.  Just good, not great.As we watched it, I related to our 10-year-old daughter the real Romeo-Juliet story as told by William Shakespeare.  When I told her the ending, she yells 'WHAT?!'.  Yes, THAT was tragic.. off the charts.  The writers tried to capture some of the tragedy.. and they did.. the story was generally okay.. two &#34;feuding families&#34; of red vs. blue gnomes.. accurate.. but didn't really impact us.  We could have chosen another movie.. (&#34;West Side Story&#34; for a much closer version to the original).This movie ended on a very &#34;up&#34; note.. happy, everybody safe.. and life in Gnome-ville goes on.. enemies are reconciled, etc., etc...The most interesting vignette takes place in the middle of the movie as the story involves the Elton John song &#34;Love Builds a Garden&#34;.. without words.. from young love to a failed, crumbled marriage.  It almost moved me to tears as I sat there looking at my wife and daughter.  At one point, my wife gasped.. &#34;Wow&#34;.  That part was tragic and accurate.Elton John's music runs throughout the movie (he was one of the producers.. duh!).. and it is used very effectively.  There was a lot of humor, and a lot of &#34;gnome jokes&#34;.. naturally.  I'd say we enjoyed it, but probably have no desire to own it.. or revisit the movie again.  Fun, but not memorable.. unless it challenges young minds to explore the real Romeo-Juliet Shakespearian tragedy.

The story is not to be compared strictly to the Shakespeare play, but it gives plenty of ""easter egg"" nods of acknowledgment to the masterpiece, including one very special (and clever) appearance that was quite a surprise to see! No spoilers here..Watching feuding gnomes in glorious color and animation will enchant the little ones, but the humor and script will captivate the older audiences, including everyone from young adult college kids (I'm 25 myself) to parents and grandparents. Keep your eyes peeled, and your ears perked, for fun and hilarious references throughout. The cast is a treat including everyone from Ozzy Osbourne to Michael Caine, and the music is great too, especially if you're a ""classic rock"" Elton John fan from days past. Every tune is either strictly from his library or carefully paraphrased background music that sends subliminal messages making you question, ""Which one is that one?"" Of course, each familiar number makes you want to sing along.As for the 3D, at first I thought some of the tricks at the beginning were ""cheap"" tricks, as are present in all 3D movies.. then the 3D opens up with some really awesome scenes which make parts of the scenery push through the screen and hover over the living room floor, from sprinkling water to the roofs of work-sheds to blades of grass to dusty debris to beautiful flowers. The crystal clear 1080p resolution brings out the rustic look of the gnomes, and the colorful palette of detail bursts with life on your 3D television. It's also a nice touch to have ""full screen"" 1.85:1 aspect ratio that fills your widescreen display without any black bars on the top and bottom.Overall, I went into this film with unfortunate doubts clouding my own judgment. The resulting smiles never ceased, the laughs were never forced, and I truly felt great when the credits rolled.

Its very clean and I can promise younger kids will love it.  I even enjoyed it myself.  The happy lawn gnomes and the beautiful scenery animation makes it a visually pleasing movie to watch.The storyline is basically this:  There are 2 yards, one with blue gnomes and the other with red gnomes.  They contantly fight and try to 1 up each other.  Apparently they do put aside their differences enough to meet up in the alley and race their owner's lawn mowers (with cheating often involved)  Juliet, who is a red gnome, goes on a mission to help better her garden.  Gnomeo who is on the run from the reds after a stealth mission into their territory goes wrong, runs into Juliet and they both fall in love in an abandoned yard.  They continue to see each other in this yard and even make friends with another lawn ornament who tells them he will keep their secret and becomes a good source of advice for the two.  As the feud heats up, the situation becomes more dangerous for both yards of gnomes, climaxing with Benny (a blue gnome) buying a backhoe style-super tractor and wrecking both yards (in case you're wondering how a gnome bought a tractor...just watch lol) leaving them completely destroyed. And I will leave it at that :)Very fun movie, lots to keep the kids entertained and I think most adults that have a young mindset will enjoy watching it too.  My only complaint is the storyline.  Romeo and Juliet is portrayed constantly!  I mean, it is a little played out.  I promise kids watching this movie will get into middle school and high school and say ""My God how many times can we tell the same story differently?!""  It just seemed like a weakness on the writers' part by choosing something that has been taken for all its worth.  Cute concept and they did modify the plot a bit but still...I have just had my fill of R&J.;  Also, the gnomes also use touch-up paint on themselves in the movie.  Why didn't one of them think ""Oh I can just repaint myself blue/red and go into the next yard?""  I just thought that was a cool idea that should have been in the movie.

1408872,AHF97M45JFCB,B004HO6HXY,ONENEO,"[0, 0]","There's a pretty strong chance that had Disney not come on board with distribution and promotion for Gnomeo and Juliet, the film wouldn't have made that big of a splash here in the United States.  But back in early 2011, it was pretty difficult to avoid the slurry of commercials, trailers and posters (complete with catchy little taglines like ""A Little Adventure Goes a Lawn Way"").  And let's be honest: The computer generated feature film industry can be very, very lucrative- just ask Pixar.  It makes sense that Elton John's production company Rocket Pictures would decide to roll the dice and try to grab a piece of the pie for their 8th and most recent project.So the immediate question is does the world need a sort of pseudo retelling of the William Shakespeare romance as told from the perspective of garden gnomes of all things?  Surprisingly, yes.  At least much in the same way as back in 1995 we stopped what we were collectively doing to tag along with a little wooden cowboy, plastic spaceman and a slinky-dog.  Sometimes decent storytelling comes from the most unlikely of places!So is it to suggest Pixar and DreamWorks need to fear the rise of Rocket Pictures? Hardly but in all fairness Gnomeo and Juliet is a pretty enjoyable romp with just enough layers to its humor to keep the adults snickering while the little ones clamor to the bright visuals and slapstick.  Then again considering the film was rumored to have required 9 credited writers an 11-year span to develop, it kind of goes without saying it should be at partially clever in its delivery.  And clever it is: Imagine a world of garden gnomes as active and energetic as any human populace with the burden of freezing into their standard poses whenever anyone so much as glances in their direction.Now add in a romantically obsessed frog/sprinkler, a Cuban accented pink flamingo, a slew of adorable little bunnies and a loyal if misguided reindeer and the formula for some miniaturized excitement begins to come together.  Now cap things off with feuding neighbors Miss Montague and Mr. Capulet, some lawnmower racing and dozens of Shakespearian references sprinkled about (my own fave being the address of the duplex: 2B and Not 2B).  Of course a soundtrack chalked full of Elton John classic tunes never hurts either!Wisely the plot doesn't go the tired and clich&eacute;d route of simply retelling the Shakespeare play so much as it draws a series of parallels to the source material then calls itself out by having a statue of the legendary playwright make an appearance explaining that he too once told a similar tale with a slightly, um, more tragic ending.Pacing is spot on across the 84-minute runtime as would be expected from a veteran such as, say, the director of Shrek 2 and though there is some silliness scattered about, the film never loses touch with that elusive sharpness separating an enjoyable film for all ages that just so happens to be animated from a cartoon only kids can enjoy.  A classic example of the subtle wit comes from Michael Caine as Juliet's overprotective father with the habit of using the wrong words when he speaks.In all I was pleasantly surprised with Gnomio and Juliet- if perhaps not for what it does right then for what it avoids doing.  And that's relying too heavily on slapstick or over-the-top visuals to replace clever writing.  Add countless pop-culture and even antiquated references for sharp-eyed viewers to search out and an infectious soundtrack and you have a pretty enjoyable way to spend an evening.  Here's hoping Rocket Pictures will revisit the CG feature film genre again in the future.  They may not yet be in a position to overthrow the industry heavyweights but that isn't to say they aren't keeping them honest.",4,More Charm Than Expected,1341878400,"07 10, 2012",2012,3763,"['pretty', 'strong', 'chance', 'had', 'Disney', 'not', 'come', 'board', 'distribution', 'promotion', 'Gnomeo', 'Juliet', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'big', 'splash', 'here', 'United', 'States', 'back', 'early', '2011', 'was', 'pretty', 'difficult', 'avoid', 'slurry', 'commercials', 'trailers', 'posters', 'complete', 'catchy', 'little', 'taglines', 'A', 'Little', 'Adventure', 'Lawn', 'Way', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'computer', 'generated', 'feature', 'film', 'industry', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'lucrative-', 'just', 'ask', 'Pixar', 'sense', 'Elton', 'John', 'production', 'company', 'Rocket', 'Pictures', 'would', 'decide', 'roll', 'dice', 'try', 'grab', 'piece', 'pie', '8th', 'most', 'recent', 'project.So', 'immediate', 'question', 'world', 'need', 'sort', 'pseudo', 'retelling', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'romance', 'told', 'perspective', 'garden', 'gnomes', 'things', 'Surprisingly', 'yes', 'least', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'back', '1995', 'stopped', 'what', 'were', 'collectively', 'doing', 'tag', 'along', 'little', 'wooden', 'cowboy', 'plastic', 'spaceman', 'slinky-dog', 'Sometimes', 'decent', 'storytelling', 'most', 'unlikely', 'places', 'So', 'suggest', 'Pixar', 'DreamWorks', 'need', 'fear', 'rise', 'Rocket', 'Pictures', 'Hardly', 'fairness', 'Gnomeo', 'Juliet', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'romp', 'just', 'enough', 'layers', 'humor', 'keep', 'adults', 'snickering', 'little', 'ones', 'clamor', 'bright', 'visuals', 'slapstick', 'Then', 'again', 'considering', 'film', 'was', 'rumored', 'have', 'required', '9', 'credited', 'writers', '11-year', 'span', 'develop', 'kind', 'saying', 'should', 'be', 'partially', 'clever', 'delivery', 'clever', 'Imagine', 'world', 'garden', 'gnomes', 'active', 'energetic', 'human', 'populace', 'burden', 'freezing', 'standard', 'poses', 'whenever', 'anyone', 'so', 'much', 'glances', 'direction.Now', 'romantically', 'obsessed', 'frog/sprinkler', 'Cuban', 'accented', 'pink', 'flamingo', 'slew', 'adorable', 'little', 'bunnies', 'loyal', 'misguided', 'reindeer', 'formula', 'miniaturized', 'excitement', 'come', 'together', 'Now', 'cap', 'things', 'off', 'feuding', 'neighbors', 'Miss', 'Montague', 'Mr.', 'Capulet', 'lawnmower', 'racing', 'dozens', 'Shakespearian', 'references', 'sprinkled', 'own', 'fave', 'being', 'address', 'duplex', '2B', 'Not', '2B', 'course', 'soundtrack', 'chalked', 'full', 'Elton', 'John', 'classic', 'tunes', 'never', 'Wisely', 'plot', ""n't"", 'go', 'tired', 'clich', 'eacute', 'route', 'simply', 'retelling', 'Shakespeare', 'play', 'so', 'much', 'series', 'parallels', 'source', 'material', 'then', 'out', 'having', 'statue', 'legendary', 'playwright', 'make', 'appearance', 'explaining', 'too', 'once', 'told', 'similar', 'tale', 'slightly', 'um', 'more', 'tragic', 'ending.Pacing', 'spot', '84-minute', 'runtime', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'veteran', 'such', 'say', 'director', 'Shrek', '2', 'silliness', 'scattered', 'film', 'never', 'touch', 'elusive', 'sharpness', 'separating', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'ages', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'animated', 'cartoon', 'only', 'kids', 'can', 'enjoy', 'classic', 'example', 'subtle', 'wit', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Juliet', 'overprotective', 'father', 'habit', 'using', 'wrong', 'words', 'when', 'speaks.In', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Gnomio', 'Juliet-', 'perhaps', 'not', 'what', 'right', 'then', 'what', 'doing', 'relying', 'too', 'heavily', 'slapstick', 'over-the-top', 'visuals', 'replace', 'clever', 'writing', 'Add', 'countless', 'pop-culture', 'even', 'antiquated', 'references', 'sharp-eyed', 'viewers', 'search', 'out', 'infectious', 'soundtrack', 'have', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'spend', 'evening', 'Here', 'hoping', 'Rocket', 'Pictures', 'will', 'revisit', 'CG', 'feature', 'film', 'genre', 'again', 'future', 'may', 'not', 'yet', 'be', 'position', 'overthrow', 'industry', 'heavyweights', ""n't"", 'say', 'are', ""n't"", 'keeping', 'honest']",N/A

As a gnome collector, I was so excited to hear about a film totally devoted to my favorite lawn ornaments. It surpassed my expectations. The clinky sounds when gnomes hit the concrete on little clay feet. Their daily business of gardening, fishing, and tending to lawn bunnies and frogs. The cattiness between Mr. Capulet and Mrs. Montague. The pink flamingo sub-plot. 'Bennie and the Jets' surprising me when Benny the gnome dances on keys on his owner's Banana computer. As an Elton John fan, I liked hearing new takes on old favorites. I didn't mind the happy ending. Most people seem to feel either delight or contempt when they see a garden gnome; there's nothing tragic about them. Kids don't have to watch star-crossed gnome lovers die in order to learn about loss here; there's enough sadness when the flamingo tells his story about his long-lost love. (And when Gnomeo and Juliet are briefly presumed dead, anyway.) The most obvious lesson in the film is the one about accepting differences. My friend took her biracial child to see the film, and they liked that the 'red hats' and 'blue hats' learned to be happy together.

Two rival next-door neighbor gnome factions, Red gnomes versus Blue gnomes, battle for most beautiful garden while the homeowners are out of sight.The best part of the movie is the cameos. You hear certain voices that ""sound like"" really famous people, or should I say really famous ""voices"". You say to yourself, ""That really isn't Hulk Hogan, is it?"" Or, ""Great impression of Dolly Parton."" Or, ""Hey, Shakespeare sounds like Patrick Stewart."" Or, ""They're trying to make that one sound like Ozzy!"" Only to watch the end credits role and see that they actually got those folks to contribute those bits to the movie.But the cameos really are the best part of the movie. Don't expect the depth that's common in most of today's PG rated animated features. The movie is as G-rated as it gets, and G ratings are hard to come by these days. I think that the only way to get a G rating today is to keep the content at a 3rd grade or lower level, and Gnomeo and Juliet does exactly that.So grab this on DVD for your children when it comes out and cuddle up with them for a viewing.

There are no 3D extra features on this disc. The soundtrack includes Elton John and Nelly Furtado to name a few. This disc is a full 1080p release and the natural depth, spacing, and size of the 3D effects are quite magnificent. General depth is very impressive, and the oddity of walking and talking gnomes appear far more realistic and convincing than their 2D counterparts. Even the blades of grass are impressive.

1408890,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B004HO6HXY,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[3, 4]","The premise of Gnomeo & Juliet is as simple as it is charming - a re-telling of the classic Romeo & Juliet tale in an all-ages story starring a cast of, yes, garden gnomes.  Well, not entirely garden gnomes - there's a bullfrog, some pink plastic lawn flamingos, a deer, a turbo-powered ride-on lawnmower, and a few other such characters, but the gnomes are the mainstay.  The blue-hatted gnomes of one backyard and their red-hatted counterparts in the yard next door have been feuding for ages, so it's inevitable thast when the adventure-seeking title characters encounter each other and fall for one another, trouble is sure to follow.I've maintained for a long time that an awfully lot of the best comedies out there can be found in the family section of the DVD store, and this one is in that batch.  It provides way more laughs than a lot of the big titles in the comedy section, and on top of that packs in ample cute appeal and a special magic that simply charms the heart.  There's just something about those rotund little gnomes scurrying about in their prized blue-or-red hats that's irresistable.  The voice acting is very well done.  With the main characters, Gnomeo & Juliet bucks the growing trend in western animation to bring in big-name stars who import their trademark personas into their animated roles, and instead lets the talented voice cast, for the most part, fit into their characters instead of the other way around.  A few exceptions to this exist in the cameo appearances of unlikely stars for supporting characters, but that's done so well you don't mind at all.  Great job on the animation itself too, with lots of care put into the facial expressions and often comedic body language of the little gnomes and their cohorts.  Overall, Gnomeo & Juliet successfully blends the wit of modern animated fare likeShrek (Two-Disc Special Edition)with the innocence and sweetness of Disney classics likeDumbo (Two-Disc 70th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray / DVD Combo Pack in DVD Packaging)andBambi (Two-Disc Diamond Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging).Whether you thrive on animated movies or see them only rarely, you've got to check this one out.",5,Magically Charming - Great Fun For All Ages,1309478400,"07 1, 2011",2011,2179,"['premise', 'Gnomeo', 'Juliet', 'as', 'simple', 'charming', 're-telling', 'classic', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'tale', 'all-ages', 'story', 'starring', 'cast', 'yes', 'garden', 'gnomes', 'Well', 'not', 'entirely', 'garden', 'gnomes', 'bullfrog', 'pink', 'plastic', 'lawn', 'flamingos', 'deer', 'turbo-powered', 'ride-on', 'lawnmower', 'few', 'other', 'such', 'characters', 'gnomes', 'are', 'mainstay', 'blue-hatted', 'gnomes', 'one', 'backyard', 'red-hatted', 'counterparts', 'yard', 'next', 'door', 'have', 'been', 'feuding', 'ages', 'inevitable', 'thast', 'when', 'adventure-seeking', 'title', 'characters', 'encounter', 'other', 'fall', 'one', 'trouble', 'sure', 'follow.I', ""'ve"", 'maintained', 'long', 'time', 'awfully', 'lot', 'best', 'comedies', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'family', 'section', 'DVD', 'store', 'one', 'batch', 'way', 'more', 'laughs', 'lot', 'big', 'titles', 'comedy', 'section', 'top', 'packs', 'ample', 'cute', 'appeal', 'special', 'magic', 'simply', 'heart', 'just', 'something', 'rotund', 'little', 'gnomes', 'scurrying', 'prized', 'blue-or-red', 'hats', 'irresistable', 'voice', 'acting', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'main', 'characters', 'Gnomeo', 'Juliet', 'growing', 'trend', 'western', 'animation', 'bring', 'big-name', 'stars', 'who', 'import', 'trademark', 'personas', 'animated', 'roles', 'instead', 'talented', 'voice', 'cast', 'most', 'part', 'fit', 'characters', 'instead', 'other', 'way', 'few', 'exceptions', 'exist', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'unlikely', 'stars', 'supporting', 'characters', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'Great', 'job', 'animation', 'too', 'lots', 'care', 'put', 'facial', 'expressions', 'often', 'comedic', 'body', 'language', 'little', 'gnomes', 'cohorts', 'Overall', 'Gnomeo', 'Juliet', 'successfully', 'wit', 'modern', 'animated', 'fare', 'likeShrek', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'innocence', 'sweetness', 'Disney', 'classics', 'likeDumbo', 'Two-Disc', '70th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'Blu-ray', '/', 'DVD', 'Combo', 'Pack', 'DVD', 'Packaging', 'andBambi', 'Two-Disc', 'Diamond', 'Edition', 'Blu-ray/DVD', 'Combo', 'Blu-ray', 'Packaging', 'thrive', 'animated', 'movies', 'see', 'only', 'rarely', ""'ve"", 'got', 'check', 'one', 'out']",N/A

I say tolerable because quality is often lacking in many of these films and then there's the issue of PG vs. G ratings. Well, when we heard Gnomeo and Juliet was being screened at our local cinema, we decided to give it a try, and to our surprise, our picky 6-year-old loved it!I have to say that this movie is mainly for young children. It is full of color, which will appeal to most kids, and there are adorable garden gnomes running around. My husband fell asleep within fifteen minutes (to be fair, he had had a long day at work), but my daughter's attention was riveted to the screen from the beginning till the end. Me? I enjoyed the music (thanks to Elton John who obligingly helped with the soundtrack featuring his classic hits - his partner David Furnish was a producer on this film). I also sort of enjoyed the silly premise - instead of the doomed star-crossed Romeo and Juliet, we have warring garden gnomes, the Reds and the Blues, and two impish and totally cute gnomes, Juliet (a Red, voiced by Emily Blunt) and Gnomeo (a Blue, voiced by James McAvoy) who flirt and later fall for each other despite their differences.The casting is a sort of coup really given the famous names featured here - there's Jim Cummings, Patrick Stewart, Dolly Parton, Ozzy Osbourne, and many more! The movie is a kaleidoscope of color and at times this can get a tad overwhelming but the children appeared to love it, so my verdict - awesome entertainment for the kiddie set!",3,3.5* - Young children will love it,1300060800,"03 14, 2011",2011,1627,"['parents', 'six-year-old', 'girl', 'husband', 'are', 'constantly', 'look-out', 'tolerable', 'kid-friendly', 'shows', 'can', 'take', 'movies', 'say', 'tolerable', 'quality', 'often', 'lacking', 'many', 'films', 'then', 'issue', 'PG', 'vs.', 'G', 'ratings', 'Well', 'when', 'heard', 'Gnomeo', 'Juliet', 'was', 'being', 'screened', 'local', 'cinema', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'surprise', 'picky', '6-year-old', 'loved', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'mainly', 'young', 'children', 'full', 'color', 'will', 'appeal', 'most', 'kids', 'are', 'adorable', 'garden', 'gnomes', 'running', 'around', 'My', 'husband', 'fell', 'asleep', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'be', 'fair', 'had', 'had', 'long', 'day', 'work', 'daughter', 'attention', 'was', 'riveted', 'screen', 'beginning', 'end', 'Me', 'enjoyed', 'music', 'thanks', 'Elton', 'John', 'who', 'obligingly', 'helped', 'soundtrack', 'featuring', 'classic', 'hits', 'partner', 'David', 'Furnish', 'was', 'producer', 'film', 'also', 'sort', 'enjoyed', 'silly', 'premise', 'instead', 'doomed', 'star-crossed', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'have', 'warring', 'garden', 'gnomes', 'Reds', 'Blues', 'two', 'impish', 'totally', 'cute', 'gnomes', 'Juliet', 'Red', 'voiced', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'Gnomeo', 'Blue', 'voiced', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'who', 'flirt', 'later', 'fall', 'other', 'differences.The', 'casting', 'sort', 'coup', 'really', 'given', 'famous', 'names', 'featured', 'here', 'Jim', 'Cummings', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'Ozzy', 'Osbourne', 'many', 'more', 'movie', 'kaleidoscope', 'color', 'times', 'can', 'get', 'tad', 'overwhelming', 'children', 'appeared', 'love', 'verdict', 'awesome', 'entertainment', 'kiddie', 'set']",N/A
