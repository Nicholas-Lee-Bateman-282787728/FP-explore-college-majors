However, what interested me enough to buy all of his early movies is that almost every single reviewer - really - was aghast at what they considered to be the next great American director creating such recent crap.These reviewers in particular mentioned the movie George Washington as his great movie.  I then purchased all of his early movies and I making my way through them, and they are great movies.This one I believe was his second endeavor after the magnificent George Washington.  It has one of the main characters from it as the main character here, in addition to a young and competent Zooey Deschanel and Danny McBride.The movie tells the tale of the contrast of small industrial town decay with the flower of youth, and how kids who do not have all of the answers struggle forward.Green's particular medium in this movie is relationships of a small town rake and the returned sister of one of his friends and his struggle to treat her decent.A great, realistic movie that one can relate to if one has grown up in a small town.",4,Pretty great coming of age in the Gothic South movie,1350259200,"10 15, 2012",2012,1153,"['first', 'came', 'know', 'David', 'Gordon', 'Green', 'how', 'crappy', 'recent', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'reading', 'online', 'reviews', 'However', 'what', 'interested', 'enough', 'buy', 'early', 'movies', 'almost', 'single', 'reviewer', 'really', 'was', 'aghast', 'what', 'considered', 'be', 'next', 'great', 'American', 'director', 'creating', 'such', 'recent', 'crap.These', 'reviewers', 'particular', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'George', 'Washington', 'great', 'movie', 'then', 'purchased', 'early', 'movies', 'making', 'way', 'are', 'great', 'one', 'believe', 'was', 'second', 'endeavor', 'magnificent', 'George', 'Washington', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'main', 'character', 'here', 'addition', 'young', 'competent', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'Danny', 'McBride.The', 'movie', 'tale', 'contrast', 'small', 'industrial', 'town', 'decay', 'flower', 'youth', 'how', 'kids', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'answers', 'struggle', 'forward.Green', 'particular', 'medium', 'movie', 'relationships', 'small', 'town', 'rake', 'returned', 'sister', 'one', 'friends', 'struggle', 'treat', 'decent.A', 'great', 'realistic', 'movie', 'one', 'can', 'relate', 'one', 'grown', 'up', 'small', 'town']",N/A

The directing is soemthing you'll have to put up with: short staccato scenes that jab you with story bits rather than drawing you into a dramatic sweep.

The good news is that it is a superior film to that earlier excellent film, and Green shows real growth as a filmmaker. Like the earlier film, this film breaks with traditional narrative, and spends the first third, or so, of its hour and forty eight minutes running time devoted to simply introducing the viewer to the main characters of the small southern town it's set in, with rapturous cinematography by Tim Orr. Although the film was shot in and around Asheville, North Carolina, it's not set in any specific time nor place. There is very little, in terms of technology nor cultural references, to date it.The film grabs the viewer from its terrific opening scene, where two unknown lovers talk about why the boy has not even tried to kiss the girl. It is an awkward, but tender, scene, and we will soon learn the reasons why he has not kissed her, but it is the sort of scene that no Hollywood producer would let any film of theirs open with. We soon learn that these two main characters are the town's noted Lothario, Paul (Paul Schneider), an aimless but earnest fellow in his early twenties, and his odd girlfriend Noel (Zooey Deschanel), the college aged sister of Paul's best friend, Tip (Shea Whigham), who looks like he just stepped out of a James Dean film. Of course, Tip objects to the relationship between his best friend and baby sister, for he knows that Paul is as big a poon hound as he is, and violence ensues. Yet, it is not in the Hollywood fashion, and plays no major role in the film, which follows the realistic ups and downs of the first real love relationship for both characters. Even though Noel is a virgin when they meet, as she comes back to town after being away at boarding school, it is Paul who is the more insecure about himself. This may be because Noel's family is from a richer social class, but the viewer need not be spoonfed such information for the scenes unfold, one after the other, and give us snippets not only into the lead characters, but into the lesser characters, too, and this, in turn, lets us know more about their social and family milieu than direct exposition through straight ahead narrative.... This film is thus one that transcends its chronological bounds on film. The viewer has seen more than enough of the lead characters to care for them, so this film is really more about the place this little romance unfolds in, not its particular participants. The film's producers, Lisa Muskat and Jean Doumanian should be commended for supporting such fine work. It will ease your angst, and make almost two hours of your life a little brighter.",4,Good Film,1220659200,"09 6, 2008",2008,2747,"['Real', 'Girls', 'was', 'David', 'Gordon', 'Green', '2003', 'follow', 'up', 'film', '2000', 'debut', 'film', 'George', 'Washington', 'became', 'underground', 'classic', 'good', 'news', 'superior', 'film', 'earlier', 'excellent', 'film', 'Green', 'shows', 'real', 'growth', 'filmmaker', 'earlier', 'film', 'film', 'traditional', 'narrative', 'first', 'third', 'so', 'hour', 'forty', 'eight', 'minutes', 'running', 'time', 'devoted', 'simply', 'introducing', 'viewer', 'main', 'characters', 'small', 'southern', 'town', 'set', 'rapturous', 'cinematography', 'Tim', 'Orr', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Asheville', 'North', 'Carolina', 'not', 'set', 'specific', 'time', 'place', 'very', 'little', 'terms', 'technology', 'cultural', 'references', 'date', 'it.The', 'film', 'grabs', 'viewer', 'terrific', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'two', 'unknown', 'lovers', 'talk', 'why', 'boy', 'not', 'even', 'tried', 'kiss', 'girl', 'awkward', 'tender', 'scene', 'will', 'soon', 'learn', 'reasons', 'why', 'not', 'kissed', 'sort', 'scene', 'Hollywood', 'producer', 'would', 'let', 'film', 'theirs', 'open', 'soon', 'learn', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'town', 'noted', 'Lothario', 'Paul', 'Paul', 'Schneider', 'aimless', 'earnest', 'fellow', 'early', 'twenties', 'odd', 'girlfriend', 'Noel', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'college', 'aged', 'sister', 'Paul', 'best', 'friend', 'Tip', 'Shea', 'Whigham', 'who', 'just', 'stepped', 'James', 'Dean', 'film', 'course', 'Tip', 'relationship', 'best', 'friend', 'baby', 'sister', 'Paul', 'as', 'big', 'poon', 'hound', 'violence', 'ensues', 'Yet', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'fashion', 'major', 'role', 'film', 'realistic', 'ups', 'downs', 'first', 'real', 'love', 'relationship', 'characters', 'Even', 'Noel', 'virgin', 'when', 'meet', 'back', 'town', 'being', 'away', 'boarding', 'school', 'Paul', 'who', 'more', 'insecure', 'may', 'be', 'Noel', 'family', 'richer', 'social', 'class', 'viewer', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'spoonfed', 'such', 'information', 'scenes', 'unfold', 'one', 'other', 'give', 'snippets', 'not', 'only', 'lead', 'characters', 'lesser', 'characters', 'too', 'turn', 'know', 'more', 'social', 'family', 'milieu', 'direct', 'exposition', 'straight', 'ahead', 'narrative', 'film', 'thus', 'one', 'chronological', 'bounds', 'film', 'viewer', 'seen', 'more', 'enough', 'lead', 'characters', 'care', 'so', 'film', 'really', 'more', 'place', 'little', 'romance', 'unfolds', 'not', 'particular', 'participants', 'film', 'producers', 'Lisa', 'Muskat', 'Jean', 'Doumanian', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'supporting', 'such', 'fine', 'work', 'will', 'ease', 'angst', 'make', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'life', 'little', 'brighter']",N/A

Then a weekend separation between the newly formed couple ensues and when they reunite, an entirely different sort of film morphs into view. For me, this transition (an egregious discontinuity in both plot and filmic ambiance) failed to work. To the extent that the first hour of the film had me mesmerized with its highly nuanced, impressionistic approach to the way in which authentic attachment between individuals progresses, the second hour seemed tediously bloated with cliche and weighed down by an often hard to believe storyline. I made it a point to see All The Real Girls because I have greatly enjoyed the work of actress Zooey Deschanel in minor roles in movies like The New Guy and The Good Girl. I have always wanted the opportunity to see what she would do with a more expansive part. I thought she was excellent in All The Real Girls up to the breach; fully able to handle the considerable burden of holding an audience's attention over a significant period of time.

It is a tender, compelling, and haunting love story with disturbingly strong performances.Paul Schneider heads the cast as Paul, a local kid with a bad reputation for toying around with several women. He soon finds himself falling truly in his best friend's (Shea Whigam) beloved sister, Noel (Zooey Deschanel). Noel has never been in a serious relationship, and neither has Paul. But... will their individual flaws ruin their only chance at love?Schneider is very good as the torn Paul. You can see his transformation into a young man trying to get his life on track. Zooey Deschanel is stunning in every way, and it is so easy to see why Paul is willing to change himself for her. I sense a star in the making...Shea Whigam is remarkable as Tip, Paul's &quot;partner in crime&quot;. Observe his facial expressions when he announces to Paul that his girlfriend is expecting a child. An amazing performance. Last but not least, Patricia Clarkson turns in yet another fine supporting turn as Paul's long-suffering mother.

760181,A1VJ7HYM1EC94M,B00009ZPTY,"G P Padillo ""paolo""","[3, 3]","In what must have been a director's dream, David Gordon Green has assembled a cast of actors that, quite simply put, could not be improved upon.  Every performance sparkles with a natural quality that feels exactly right.  The story is a classically simple one: womanizing boy meets best friend's sister, falls in love, (thereby initially threatening friendship) encounters relationship threatening hardship and doubt, family problems followed by a huge dose of self-examination.As Paul, Paul Schneider gives a breakthrough performance striking chords that will resonate strongly for most men who made (or are making) the transition from teenage years to manhood, stumbling and bumbling along the way.  A powerful combination of bravado and self-doubt ensures we see all sides of Paul's character - good and ill, making him thoroughly someone you instantly like, but still want to knock upside the head.Zooey Deschanel commands the screen with an innocence that fairly crackles.  She also has brings an allure not found in actresses with ten times her experience making Noel's story and predicament identifiable to legions of blossoming young maidens.A third great performance is found in Shea Whigam's turn at Tip, Paul's best friend.  Starting over-the-top, Whigam finds Tip's core, cooling down the hothead.  The scene in where he finds himself immediately immersed into adulthood in particular is powerfully moving.Then there is Patricia Clarkson. With the least amount of screen time of all the principals, as Paul's mother - Elvira, Clarkson gives a performance that could be required viewing for all actors, proving with relish that age old adage ""there are no small roles.""  Watching her, clown make-up and all, in this searing performance was, alone, worth the price of admission.  Getting to Elvira's heart we feel her frustration at the loss of dreams and having to cope with the harsh, brutal realization that life may not turn out anything even remotely how we may have planned.  If Clarkson doesn't break your heart see a doctor.Some may find the slow, lyrical pace of All The Real Girls a bit measured, but the movie provides rare rewards for those who stay with it.Ultimately, I think viewers who will judge this movie most harshly (and I've been proven right) are those close to the age of the film's characters - too close to be truly observant.

It boasts a strong cast, has some moments of touching repartee, but in the end we are left with a lack of feeling for/caring about any of the characters.  Green's fidgety camera work, jumbled scene changes, and lack of character development prevent the good points to out weigh the weak ones.Hometown lothario Paul (Paul Schneider) is best friends with another womanizer Tip (Shea Whigham) whose sister Noel (Zooey Deschanel) returns home from a boarding school and falls for Paul.  Paul and Noel do a courtship dance, the first act of a relationship that includes more talk and self-confession than physical.  Tip objects to Paul's interest in his sister and this of course only fans the flame of romance.  The cadre of homeboys (Danny R. McBride and Maurice Compte) watch on the sidelines as the Romeo and Juliet affair takes place.  Paul's mother (Patricia Clarkson) and uncle (Benjamin Mouton) add what words of twisted wisdom they can.  The love affair is the first serious relationship Paul has ever encountered and for the first time it is the girl who throws the wrench into the experience, a factor that allows the story to simply end.With a cast that includes some truly gifted actors (Deschanel and Clarkson especially) the viewer has to reflect on why there is no true concern for anybody in the film, no screen chemistry and no charisma that would have helped make this belabored effort worthwhile.  David Gordon Green is young and has some very sound ideas about film, but he needs to talk to his audiences about communication to enable him to make solid movies.

Slow-paced, sensitive, and dreamy, it gets deep inside of its characters. Paul may be a callous seducer, but he's so gentle with the girl he loves, that he won't even take her virginity when they get a hotel room. When she makes some mistakes that he considers betrayal, this blue-collar tough guy is just as heartbroken and emotionally vulnerable as anybody with more ""refinement"". Although he is a mechanic in a Southern Podunk town, his character is portrayed without any Southern or working class stereotypes.It's a collaborative movie made by college buddies. Director David Gordon Green and star Paul Schneider also co-wrote the screenplay, and went to college together. Editor Zene Baker is another college buddy. I suppose you might truly call this a true collaboration. Green has the title of director, but when your two best buds are also your editor and screenwriter, not to mention the fact that one of them is on camera constantly, it's difficult to say where one person's contribution ends and another's begins.If you would enjoy a slice of life comedy/drama that will probably evoke many memories of how you felt when you won and then lost your first love, this is an effective and heartfelt personal statement about that moment of time. The small town locales and the original score work to perfection.

Yet, she does not reciprocate that respect and the inevitable disillusionment sets in because of it. He soon realizes that the person he loved never really existed at all. That she only seemed that way due to her boarding school upbringing, that she isn't as she is by choice, but by environment alone. Now that she is out of school she quickly morphs back into a ""real girl"" if you will. As interesting as I found it I also found the cynicism of it all rather depressing. I say this because if this is what ""all the real girls"" are like, who would want one. For according to this, ""all the real girls"" are not worthy of a man's respect.

Burns,"[0, 2]","I FINALLY got the chance to see ""All The Real Girls"" at my local movie theater (only four days from its DVD release no less), and as I walked into it, I realized how much I'd built the film up in my mind. Since near the beginning of the year, I'd looked forward to seeing Green's follow-up to the atmospheric, cerebral ""George Washington."" Did ""Girls"" live up to my expectations? Yes, and more. Since I saw it, I have been haunted every single minute by it - yes, that sounds hokey and overwrought, but it's true. I can hear the film's opening song, shots go through my head - thank God I bought the DVD, because I'd be running to the theater just to satisfy my yearning. The paradoxical deal with this is, ""All The Real Girls"" isn't perfect, but it makes such a strong imprint on the viewer, its little imperfections work together to go into the marrow of the love story it portrays. The ups and downs of the film literally become the ups and downs of the love story that we see on film. The last movie I have seen that has literally embodied the story it told like this has been ""Wings of Desire,"" which is a pretty lofty comparison, but totally appropriate. I loved ""All The Real Girls,"" and find myself returning to its haunting, lyrical images and words like the comfort of a blanket or a good book. No other movie I've seen this year has made such an impression. David Gordon Green's work is like no other out there.

And he's taken advantage of this like most guys of his ilk and has earned a well deserved bad rep for loving and leaving `em; which is particularly sticky for Paul because he lives in a small, going to seed town in middle America in which Everyone knows Everyone else... and they all know Paul's business.Paul meets Noel (Zooey Deschanel) and he decides to change his spots and, treat her with respect and thereby repent and follow the straight and narrow, as it were. Noel has other ideas, though.David Gordon Green, the director and writer of ""All The Real Girls"" has structured this movie in a very laidback, molasses in the summer manner and has cut the film into many short scenes: some with dialogue, many without. He's after the long term, not the immediate effect of these images to have their impact and for the most part he succeeds; even though the first 15 minutes of the film is hard going, as we don't know what he is trying to do and the stiffness of the actors and their delivery of the dialogue begins to get irritating.Yet, the most touching scenes in this film are those between Paul and his Mom (Patricia Clarkson), Paul and his Uncle and Paul and his friends. His friends, all of them men in their 20's, are guys who are not afraid to open up emotionally to each other. All of these scenes are so warm and natural that they seem improvised.  In fact, Gordon shows that these people, though under-educated but obviously endowed with an extraordinary amount of horse sense, have an intelligent and insightful awareness of their emotions and an appreciation of all the relationships in their lives. These scenes crackle with truth and nobility.In many ways ""All The Real Girls"" owes a lot to the French Nouvelle Vague in that it is the accumulation of the images and the dialogue that ultimately hits you with it's intended effect: most scenes do not have a climax as the director builds his arsenal of scenes and moods. We are so used to the very literal, linear film that this style of filmmaking makes us antsy for the director to ""get on with it.""

Noel's brother Tip (Shea Whigham) disapproves of the relationship because he knows Paul's ways with women. Together Tip and Paul acquired a reputation for loving and leaving most of the town's available young women. But now they are both a little older, and Paul has found a woman whom he loves to talk to and listen to. Paul desperately wants his relationship with Noel to be different from his past dalliances. Their romance goes well until a decision that Noel makes drives a wedge between them, leaving Noel at loose ends and Paul distraught and angry.&quot;All the Real Girls&quot; is a film that concentrates uniquely on the interrelationships between a small group of people in a town where you may get the feeling that not much goes on outside of interpersonal relationships. The film was written and directed by David Gordon Green. I have to say that I have never seen emotions articulated this clearly in a film. The degree to which these characters tell each other precisely what they are feeling was almost startling until I got used to it. Paul and Noel are two young people in love for the first time and struggling to make their first serious relationship work. What makes them unique is that, instead of being afraid to share their feelings with one another, they constantly tell each other all of their hopes, frustrations, shortcomings, and anything else they might be thinking about. I doubt that this is remotely realistic in any relationship, but it is interesting to watch and wonder if this kind of openness would actually help or hurt a relationship, or make no difference at all. I give the film only 3 stars, though, for a couple of reasons. &quot;All the Real Girls&quot; greatest fault is that there is no chemistry between the two lead actors, and not once was I convinced that the two characters were in love, despite what they were saying. This is a serious flaw because Paul and Noel's relationship is the focal point of the story. The film is also very talky, as you may have inferred. Add to this the fact that the film's pace is unnecessarily languid, and I think that it will not maintain the attention of most moviegoers. I recommend &quot;All the Real Girls&quot; to those who traditionally like talky relationship movies. You might find something unique in this one.

Budding young love envelopes Noel (Zooey Deschanel) and Paul (Paul Schneider) in a textile mill town in North Carolina.  Paul and his buddies just hang out most of the time.  His best friend Tip is Noel's brother and he's not too happy about the romance.  Why?  Well he and Paul are pretty much known as having slept with every girl in town that would have them, and maybe a few that didn't.  That's about it.  What makes movies like this so enjoyable is that everything feels real.  It's hard to imagine that the characters aren't just making stuff up as they go along.  They use words that are simple yet poetic in tone and rhythm.  I've been a fan of Deschanel for a long time.  She is beautiful, but in an understated way.  She never seems to be acting.  The words just slip out au natural.  Paul Schneider is also an underused and underappreciated actor.  Together they are magical.

760192,A2UM70SXX6TY30,B00009ZPTY,"Ned K. Wynn ""EKW""","[11, 31]","This movie is a long, slow, earnest melodrama about small town twenty-somethings struggling to...you know...find themselves...get somewhere...grow up...ah, hell, I have no idea, really. The movie is shot so that we are stuck in that eternal autumn that permeates most small-town melodramas. All oranges, browns, and golds. The characters meander through their lives with little direction and no visible means of support. There's a factory which none of the characters seems to work in. Zooey Deschanel plays a very confused girl who is a virgin when she starts dating Paul Schneider. Schneider is a player (that's right, all of a sudden there are at least two babes in this town that we see Schneider has, erm...pleasured. They wear professional makeup and have their hair done in New York. Or at least that is what it looks like.) He falls for Deschanel and doesn't screw her because he's a changed guy. It's his new self. So what does Deschanel's character do? She does a bad thing at a weekend party at a lake. The whole rest of the film is devoted to the pain and inchoate ramblings of Schneider and the rest of the cast, all of whose lives seem to be hopeless and in need of repeated doses of stiff, tough-sounding and superficial philosophies which, it appears, everyone can spout. Nothing like dead-end stultifying, small-town life to turn a really average guy into a sage. The worst are the virtually tongue-tied ramblings of Deschanel which are so painful to sit through that I wanted to rip my own face off. While there are moments of dimmed insight in this movie, for the most part it is self-indulgent and plodding, filled with little meaningless scenes that give it an art-house feel. Deschanel is fine as the wounded/wounding girl, Schneider is stiff, pasty, and dull as the boyfriend (he also wrote the story). He looks way too old for the Deschanel girl which, apparently, he is.",1,Some films should just be pitched over a cliff,1140825600,"02 25, 2006",2006,1895,"['movie', 'long', 'slow', 'earnest', 'melodrama', 'small', 'town', 'twenty-somethings', 'struggling', 'know', 'find', 'get', 'somewhere', 'grow', 'up', 'ah', 'hell', 'have', 'idea', 'really', 'movie', 'shot', 'so', 'are', 'stuck', 'eternal', 'autumn', 'most', 'small-town', 'melodramas', 'oranges', 'browns', 'golds', 'characters', 'meander', 'lives', 'little', 'direction', 'visible', 'means', 'support', 'factory', 'none', 'characters', 'work', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'very', 'confused', 'girl', 'who', 'virgin', 'when', 'dating', 'Paul', 'Schneider', 'Schneider', 'player', 'right', 'sudden', 'are', 'least', 'two', 'babes', 'town', 'see', 'Schneider', 'pleasured', 'wear', 'professional', 'makeup', 'have', 'hair', 'done', 'New', 'York', 'least', 'what', 'Deschanel', ""n't"", 'screw', 'changed', 'guy', 'new', 'self', 'So', 'what', 'Deschanel', 'character', 'do', 'bad', 'thing', 'weekend', 'party', 'lake', 'whole', 'rest', 'film', 'devoted', 'pain', 'inchoate', 'ramblings', 'Schneider', 'rest', 'cast', 'lives', 'seem', 'be', 'hopeless', 'need', 'repeated', 'doses', 'stiff', 'tough-sounding', 'superficial', 'philosophies', 'everyone', 'can', 'spout', 'Nothing', 'dead-end', 'stultifying', 'small-town', 'life', 'turn', 'really', 'average', 'guy', 'sage', 'worst', 'are', 'virtually', 'tongue-tied', 'ramblings', 'Deschanel', 'are', 'so', 'painful', 'sit', 'wanted', 'rip', 'own', 'face', 'are', 'moments', 'dimmed', 'insight', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'self-indulgent', 'plodding', 'filled', 'little', 'meaningless', 'scenes', 'give', 'art-house', 'feel', 'Deschanel', 'fine', 'wounded/wounding', 'girl', 'Schneider', 'stiff', 'pasty', 'dull', 'boyfriend', 'also', 'wrote', 'story', 'way', 'too', 'old', 'Deschanel', 'girl', 'apparently']",N/A

She could be referring to the title or to any number of unorganized dialogue elements that have been uttered throughout the film. At this point curious viewers will bond with Noel because they have been asking that same question throughout the story and will continue to ask it until David Gordon Green's film school project mercifully fades out after exhausting its 108 minutes of running time. When I got around to watching the film's trailer I realized that this disorganized film is more like a very long trailer of clips than a feature film.I have read that this was not a happy set and the Green is a first-class jerk. The latter quality certainly comes across on the DVD's commentary feature and short featurette, ""Improv and Ensemble: The Evolution of a Film"". There is a staggering conceit that is immediately apparent in the film and I found the viewing experience strangely unpleasant, perhaps I was subconsciously picking up on the bad vibes that permeated the whole production.This may also account for the total disconnect between the great technical quality of the film (the framing of shots, the audio, and all the 2nd unit stuff) and the universally poor performances of the cast. Since not all of this could be written off as lack of acting skill (although there is plenty of that), it may rest with Green who comes across as clueless (or disinterested) about acting for the camera directing. The actors flip in and out of character so often it becomes almost surreal. And Green fails to keep the actors on the same intensity level in many of the scenes. These are signs that the Director of Photography and the Assistant Director are most likely the ones responsible for the successful elements of the production.""BUT"", there are some people who seemingly really connected with this film, so I suggest doing a extensive read of the comments and reviews if you are considering a purchase. Folks seem to either love it or hate it. Although I belong at least slightly in the ""hate it"" camp, that is in part because I am a big fan of Hillary Bingingham's ""Tully"", which is virtually the same story but clearer, more involving, and dramatically more complex. And while not a ""chick flick"", it is more female friendly (i.e. not exclusively targeted at twenty-something males). If you want to see only one film then the clear choice is ""Tully"", if you want to see both then you would be wise to watch ""All the Real Girls"" first because it loses badly in any comparison.  In both films a country rou', who has gone through most of the area girls, falls in love for the first time. He looks to his young virgin love for redemption, until they have a falling out.Green's meandering film comes up way short in the comparative casting department. Not a surprise since Green uses many of his film school buddies whose acting for the camera deficiencies become especially glaring in scenes with veterans like Deschanel and Patricia Clarkson.. Deschanel is too polished and pretty to be believably paired with aging film school buddy Paul Schneider. Clarkson (who came close to ruining Angela Bettis' performance in the ""Carrie"" remake) overplays the corn-pone element and opens up the question of how Paul could have grown up with such a mother, and in rural North Carolina, yet acquired the non-accent of a news anchorman. The more plot-driven, suspenseful, and tightly organized ""Tully"" features Anson Mount, who (unlike Schneider) exudes confidence and a dangerous sex appeal. His costar, Julianne Nicholson, with her red hair and freckles is effortlessly charming and very intelligent. You immediately sense their mutual attraction and chemistry. Conversely, you never buy into the Deschanel-Schneider pairing. Since you never believe it when they connect you don't really care about their disconnection.I have generally liked Deschanel in her quirky supporting roles but the challenges of trying to carry this film expose her limitations. There is one unintentionally hilarious scene where she describes an act of self-mutilation with a fishhook. Between painful laughs you can't help but feel sorry for her being stuck (pun intended) with this long series of lame lines. That should have found its way into the deleted scene section. Unfortunately this was not the only editing and assembly issue. The second unit (presumably) shot all sorts of beautiful wide angle shots of rural North Carolina and the editor inserted these as scene transitions. But instead of match cuts (sky to sky, water to water) or establishment shots, they are totally unrelated to either the scene before or the scene after. Of course it would have taken a small degree of vision and organizational skill by the director to have the transitions actually relate to the story.Then again, what do I know?

Up-and-coming Zooey Deschanel is very likeable.It is not a fast-paced drama.  It is a slow-paced, placid type of drama.  Some people may like and prefer these.  I do not think I do.Zooey plays a teenage girl of a small, sleepy town.  Her name is Noel and this movie accounts her falling-in-love experience with Paul, a player.  Neither has been in a serious relationship before.  Basically, Zooey is the angel-in-disguise who will save Paul (played by Paul Schneider) from his womanizing ways.Puh-leeze.Is Paul supposed to be a teenager?  He looks about 30 years old and next to a fresh-faced and young Zooey, this looks utterly ridiculous.  The dialogue was weak and limp enough to make me shriek.  The performances were dreadful.

It is subdued and realistic; yet, there is poetic cinematography that enhances a small town romance.  I can't believe that David Green and Paul Schneider just hatched this script in a dorm room.  The miracle that a film like this can be made, the enormous cost of film, I am impressed.Paul is a nice Southern boy in the Smokey Mountains that has already tasted the town girls.  His mom is a piece of work and he's just shy of being a momma's boy.  Paul's best friend has a sister that has been away at boarding school for years.  (Yes, this is contrived.)  Zooey Deschanel is cute and ready for a love adventure after her cloistered years.  Paul is crazy about her, but sex with someone you love is an Oedipus moment, so things are beautiful and terrible at the same time.  If you don't understand, get a copy of Freud's Lectures, 1927.We totally related to the sensitivities of Schneider in this role.  They speak slowly in this town and feel deeply.  They are surrounded by nature and industry in turn.  My one complaint, well, maybe more than one, I thought Schneider a few years too old for this part.

To say this is a movie about &quot;young love&quot; doesn't give enough credit to the many layers.  We see how this love affair affects not only the couple, but those close to them...friends, parents, previous lovers, etc.  It is a tenderly made movie, slow to develop.  No one really makes any brilliant speeches that feel like a writer labored over them...yet the people are talking all the time.  Their emotions are right there to be understood by any feeling, thinking person.It's a rare thing to feel such EMPATHY for characters.  In many of the scenes, we are right there with them.  The filmmaker, working with a miniscule budget, has made the choice to let the ambient sounds of this little factory town just kinda wash over most of the scenes.  We can almost imagine that we're looking and listening out of a window, eavesdropping on the conversations of others.  This makes us realize how often when we observe film, we are being &quot;manipulated&quot; by professionals...ALL THE REAL GIRLS feels real.It's a heady experience, and we draw close to these characters in a way we don't often.  I'm not saying that more &quot;Hollywood&quot; movies don't make us care about the characters...it just FEELS a little different here, and that is a kick.Everyone in the movie is excellent...but I especially commend the two women.  Patricia Clarkson (so brilliant in FAR FROM HEAVEN) gives another effortless performance here.  I believe an Oscar lies in her not too distant future.  SHe just needs to be in a movie seen by a few more people.  And Zooey Deschanel is capable of being one of our GREAT young actresses.  She is attractive in a totally believable way.  She has a naturalistic, unself-conscious manner...mixed with some genuine quirkiness.  I like her a lot!Towards the end of the movie, the central relationship runs into some MAJOR roadblocks.  These are painful, and we are eager for a &quot;Hollywood&quot; resolution.  It doesn't come...but neither does an emotional payoff.  We see how the characters lives are changed...how they develop in their understands.  But somehow, just when we should be feeling it most, the characters suck their emotions into themselves...leaving us, their sympathetic viewers, out in the ocld.  So, although I totally admire the movie, the craft, the totally convincing performances...I ended up leaving the movie theater feeling let down.  I'm not saying the movie needed a &quot;happy ending&quot; or a &quot;tear-jerker&quot; moment...but it does take the naturalistic approach just a bit too far...it needed just a bit more &quot;plot.&quot;By all means take a look at this movie, though.

They do a great job capturing the innocence, awkwardness, and cocky assuredness of young adolescence in a ""truth of moment"" sort of way. The script and cinematography are the real strengths as you feel you're catching a young director at his last moment before the world takes notice. Another fitting description, ""I am a student of Terrence Malick"" - the visual poetry is balanced by language vs. still photos. Nature and the human element personified. The film plays out as star-crossed lovers grapple with their past transgressions, first real love, and come face-to-face with the real culprits - themselves. Very seldom is there room in a relationship for both parties to be ultra cool and hip as we soon find out. Their relationship is affected by family and friends alike as these people feel almost hillbilly close. Shot in the hills of North Carolina, the timeless look and feel serve as a private invitation to participate in their mistakes and joys. There is a tad of the unbelievable here though. Many of the lines are a bit rich for these backwoods yahoos and goofballs. We asked to accept these folk are wise beyond their years, but the whole group of them at the same time? Doubtful. It's also obvious this tight group of crew and cast have worked together before. The cohesion that takes place is subliminal, unspoken, and understood as the initial scene immediately draws you in. David Gordon Green as a director is a heartbeat away from being offered a big, blockbuster Hollywood script. As he has a gift, let's hope young Green can resist the huge temptation and continue to tell these honest, poignant, personal, and very touching tales.

This was a film that spoke with the memorable poetry of someone both common and extrordinary in its unique dialogue, and melted me with its beautiful images. Well, Green is back again this year and he is clearly going places (while remaining in the deep south with his films, a place clearly near to his heart). His second feature, All the Real Girls, took strides from his first and made me truly excited as to where this talented young director will go next.A poetic and honest film, All the Real Girls explores young love and the tragedy of two people who's lives simply intersect at the wrong point in time. Green said to his co-writer and star of the film (Paul Schneider) that they needed to make this story and they needed to do it soon, because they weren't getting any younger. Well, the feelings must still be fresh enough, because this outpouring comes straight from a young heart. It brings its viewer back to a time when they could identify completely with those feelings of being in over one's head and just fighting to keep on the surface.On top of being a refreshing and unique portrayal of a teen-esque romance, All the Real Girls is simply more than solid in all of its aspects. It delivers some of the absolute best performances of the year (Patricia Clarkson, Zooey Deschanel, and Paul Schneider are all noteworthy here), one of the best scripts, and Green's signature striking photography. All the Real Girls is a film in the spirit and tradition of those of Terrence Malick (one of Green's inspirations) and is not to be missed.",4,"""I Had A Dream You Grew A Garden On A Trampoline""",1101945600,"12 2, 2004",2004,1649,"['When', 'David', 'Gordon', 'Green', 'debut', 'film', 'George', 'Washington', 'came', 'out', '2000', 'was', 'instantly', 'captured', 'was', 'film', 'spoke', 'memorable', 'poetry', 'someone', 'common', 'extrordinary', 'unique', 'dialogue', 'melted', 'beautiful', 'images', 'Well', 'Green', 'back', 'again', 'year', 'clearly', 'going', 'places', 'remaining', 'deep', 'south', 'films', 'place', 'clearly', 'heart', 'second', 'feature', 'Real', 'Girls', 'took', 'strides', 'first', 'made', 'truly', 'excited', 'where', 'talented', 'young', 'director', 'will', 'go', 'next.A', 'poetic', 'honest', 'film', 'Real', 'Girls', 'young', 'love', 'tragedy', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'lives', 'simply', 'intersect', 'wrong', 'point', 'time', 'Green', 'said', 'co-writer', 'star', 'film', 'Paul', 'Schneider', 'needed', 'make', 'story', 'needed', 'do', 'soon', 'were', ""n't"", 'getting', 'younger', 'Well', 'feelings', 'must', 'still', 'be', 'fresh', 'enough', 'outpouring', 'straight', 'young', 'heart', 'viewer', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'could', 'identify', 'completely', 'feelings', 'being', 'one', 'head', 'just', 'fighting', 'keep', 'surface.On', 'top', 'being', 'refreshing', 'unique', 'portrayal', 'teen-esque', 'romance', 'Real', 'Girls', 'simply', 'more', 'solid', 'aspects', 'absolute', 'best', 'performances', 'year', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'Paul', 'Schneider', 'are', 'noteworthy', 'here', 'one', 'best', 'scripts', 'Green', 'signature', 'striking', 'photography', 'Real', 'Girls', 'film', 'spirit', 'tradition', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'one', 'Green', 'inspirations', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

""Snow Angels"" is easily one of the greatest dramas ever filmed and ""Undertow"" is a mesmerizing piece of Southern Gothic, even while its point remains elusive. This explains why I was geared-up for a great love story/drama with 2003's ""All the Real Girls,"" which was written & directed by Green.Alas, it was not to be. ""All the Real Girls"" is a huge disappointment.Understand that I love indie flicks because they're generally more creative and daring than their Hollywood cardboard cut-out counterparts. I prefer creative, unique and daring cinema to formulaic, predictable mainstream drek. But ""All the Real Girls"" has all the marks of an indie flick gone horribly wrong -- tedious melodrama, uninteresting characters, horrible dialogue that's trying too hard to be ""realistic"" and artful. I once heard someone say that the greatest sin in cinema is to be boring and I agree. Well, ""All the Real Girls"" transgresses big time.The only reasons I'm giving it 2 Stars instead of 1 are because the cinematography and locations are spectacular. The film was shot in the Asheville, Marshall & Cherokee regions of Western North Carolina. Plus the actors do a fine job (e.g. Paul Schneider, Zooey Deschanel & Patricia Clarkson) with Shea Whigham standing out as Tip, the main girl's brother who doesn't want Schneider's character taking advantage of his sister, but that angle goes nowhere. The problem wasn't the actors but rather the dull story and totally stoo-pid dialogue they got saddled with. A good example is when Schneider and Zooey are hanging out in a bowling alley, apparently near closing time because I didn't see or hear another soul, when Schneider says he wants to dance but doesn't want her to see him. So she turns around and he goes into some goofy dance antics. It's a useless, eye-rolling scene, but -- believe it or not -- it's better than the bulk of the dreadfully tedious scenes in the film.The story, on the surface, could've been interesting: A small town (supposed) Casanova falls for a young virgin just back from boarding school. She breaks his heart and he has to deal with it. (Hey, you reap what you sow, sucka). This is a theme we all can relate to one way or another, but it all comes across as a big meaningless zero.If you enjoyed ""Snow Angels"" and ""Undertow"" don't expect the same greatness here.GRADE: D+",2,A misstep for David Gordon Green,1308873600,"06 24, 2011",2011,2468,"[""'ve"", 'seen', '2007', 'Snow', 'Angels', '2004', 'Undertow', ""'d"", 'know', 'David', 'Gordon', 'Green', 'filmmaker', 'highest', 'caliber', 'Snow', 'Angels', 'easily', 'one', 'greatest', 'dramas', 'ever', 'filmed', 'Undertow', 'mesmerizing', 'piece', 'Southern', 'Gothic', 'even', 'point', 'elusive', 'why', 'was', 'geared-up', 'great', 'love', 'story/drama', '2003', 'Real', 'Girls', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Green.Alas', 'was', 'not', 'be', 'Real', 'Girls', 'huge', 'disappointment.Understand', 'love', 'indie', 'flicks', ""'re"", 'generally', 'more', 'creative', 'daring', 'Hollywood', 'cardboard', 'cut-out', 'counterparts', 'prefer', 'creative', 'unique', 'daring', 'cinema', 'formulaic', 'predictable', 'mainstream', 'drek', 'Real', 'Girls', 'marks', 'indie', 'flick', 'gone', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'tedious', 'melodrama', 'uninteresting', 'characters', 'horrible', 'dialogue', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'realistic', 'artful', 'once', 'heard', 'someone', 'say', 'greatest', 'sin', 'cinema', 'be', 'boring', 'agree', 'Well', 'Real', 'Girls', 'big', 'time.The', 'only', 'reasons', ""'m"", 'giving', '2', 'Stars', 'instead', '1', 'are', 'cinematography', 'locations', 'are', 'spectacular', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Asheville', 'Marshall', 'Cherokee', 'regions', 'Western', 'North', 'Carolina', 'actors', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'e.g', 'Paul', 'Schneider', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Shea', 'Whigham', 'standing', 'out', 'Tip', 'main', 'girl', 'brother', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'Schneider', 'character', 'taking', 'advantage', 'sister', 'angle', 'nowhere', 'problem', 'was', ""n't"", 'actors', 'rather', 'dull', 'story', 'totally', 'stoo-pid', 'dialogue', 'got', 'saddled', 'good', 'example', 'when', 'Schneider', 'Zooey', 'are', 'hanging', 'out', 'bowling', 'alley', 'apparently', 'closing', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'hear', 'soul', 'when', 'Schneider', 'dance', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'around', 'goofy', 'dance', 'antics', 'useless', 'eye-rolling', 'scene', 'believe', 'not', 'better', 'bulk', 'dreadfully', 'tedious', 'scenes', 'film.The', 'story', 'surface', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'interesting', 'small', 'town', 'supposed', 'Casanova', 'young', 'virgin', 'just', 'back', 'boarding', 'school', 'heart', 'deal', 'Hey', 'reap', 'what', 'sow', 'sucka', 'theme', 'can', 'relate', 'one', 'way', 'across', 'big', 'meaningless', 'zero.If', 'enjoyed', 'Snow', 'Angels', 'Undertow', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'same', 'greatness', 'here.GRADE', 'D+']",N/A
