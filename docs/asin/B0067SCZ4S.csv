1512871,A2R72URRJ0DSY8,B0067SCZ4S,AAL2215,"[1, 1]",This is exactly what I was looking for. I do a lot of Jillian Michaels and love the good workout she provides but was looking for something just as good that wasn't an hour long. The 20 minute segments are great. Depending on how much time you have you can select how many you'd like to do. I thought Jessica Smith did a great job picking moves that work. It does have some short bursts of cardio in it which I also enjoyed. The only con I had was that the ab section is hard on my neck. For the first few minutes she has you in a sit up position with your neck up and it did start to make my neck hurt to the point I quit. But now that I'm aware of it I make just make some changes and try it again. Definitely glad that I bought this.,5,Great workout,1366934400,"04 26, 2013",2013,736,"['exactly', 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'do', 'lot', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'love', 'good', 'workout', 'was', 'looking', 'something', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'was', ""n't"", 'hour', 'long', '20', 'minute', 'segments', 'are', 'great', 'Depending', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'have', 'can', 'select', 'how', 'many', ""'d"", 'like', 'do', 'thought', 'Jessica', 'Smith', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'picking', 'moves', 'work', 'have', 'short', 'bursts', 'cardio', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'only', 'con', 'had', 'was', 'ab', 'section', 'hard', 'neck', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'sit', 'up', 'position', 'neck', 'up', 'did', 'start', 'make', 'neck', 'hurt', 'point', 'quit', 'now', ""'m"", 'aware', 'make', 'just', 'make', 'changes', 'try', 'again', 'Definitely', 'glad', 'bought']",10 Pounds DOWN: Better Body Blast

1512873,AU35J9IZ6Z84O,B0067SCZ4S,BMJ,"[4, 4]","I am an intermediate to advanced exerciser and have been a Jessica Smith fan for a couple of years now. I was so excited about this DVD that I just had to try all 20-minute segments yesterday, as soon as it was delivered. And, my goodness, am I feeling it today! I started with the leg workout, and I usually use 10-12 pounds for my legs, but 8 pounds more than sufficed for this one. High reps and lots of creative moves, and I really enjoyed the cardio bursts. I then moved on to the ab workout, which is heavily Pilates-based, because I wanted to be thoroughly warm but still relatively fresh for core work. This is probably one of the toughest ab workouts I've done, which says a lot as I've done many ab workouts in the past nine years, including Ab Ripper X from the P90X series. My abs were SCREAMING five minutes in. I was a little disappointed in myself because I had to take multiple breaks throughout the segment, but I'm sure I'll get accustomed to the exercises the more I do this DVD. I saved the upper body workout for last because I assumed it wouldn't exhaust me quite as much. Man, was I wrong! I typically use 5-8 pounds for most arm exercises, and I stuck to using the recommended 5 pounds for this one, but because of the volume of reps, my arms were so spent halfway through the first exercise that I probably would've been happy using 3 pounds for most of the moves. CRAZY! As with the abs workout, I unfortunately had to take a few breaks, but again, I will also get more accustomed to these (new and creative) moves the more I do them--and you best believe I will! Oh, and I LOVED the boxing cardio breaks.One tip: Even with limited cardio, this is a BIG calorie burner. Although you can get away with working out on an empty stomach for some routines, definitely have a healthy protein-based snack an hour or two before this one! I had exhausted my reserves after the first two segments, and my body was BEGGING for protein by the time I was done.",5,Another awesome workout by Jessica Smith!,1354233600,"11 30, 2012",2012,1973,"['am', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'exerciser', 'have', 'been', 'Jessica', 'Smith', 'fan', 'couple', 'years', 'now', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'DVD', 'just', 'had', 'try', '20-minute', 'segments', 'yesterday', 'as', 'soon', 'was', 'delivered', 'goodness', 'am', 'feeling', 'today', 'started', 'leg', 'workout', 'usually', 'use', '10-12', 'pounds', 'legs', '8', 'pounds', 'more', 'sufficed', 'one', 'High', 'reps', 'lots', 'creative', 'moves', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'cardio', 'then', 'moved', 'ab', 'workout', 'heavily', 'Pilates-based', 'wanted', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'warm', 'still', 'relatively', 'fresh', 'core', 'work', 'probably', 'one', 'toughest', 'ab', 'workouts', ""'ve"", 'done', 'lot', ""'ve"", 'done', 'many', 'ab', 'workouts', 'past', 'nine', 'years', 'including', 'Ab', 'Ripper', 'X', 'P90X', 'series', 'abs', 'were', 'SCREAMING', 'five', 'minutes', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'had', 'take', 'multiple', 'breaks', 'segment', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'get', 'accustomed', 'exercises', 'more', 'do', 'DVD', 'saved', 'upper', 'body', 'workout', 'last', 'assumed', 'would', ""n't"", 'exhaust', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'Man', 'was', 'wrong', 'typically', 'use', '5-8', 'pounds', 'most', 'arm', 'exercises', 'stuck', 'using', 'recommended', '5', 'pounds', 'one', 'volume', 'reps', 'arms', 'were', 'so', 'spent', 'halfway', 'first', 'exercise', 'probably', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'happy', 'using', '3', 'pounds', 'most', 'moves', 'CRAZY', 'abs', 'workout', 'unfortunately', 'had', 'take', 'few', 'breaks', 'again', 'will', 'also', 'get', 'more', 'accustomed', 'new', 'creative', 'more', 'do', 'best', 'believe', 'will', 'Oh', 'LOVED', 'boxing', 'cardio', 'breaks.One', 'tip', 'Even', 'limited', 'cardio', 'BIG', 'calorie', 'burner', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'working', 'out', 'empty', 'stomach', 'routines', 'definitely', 'have', 'healthy', 'protein-based', 'snack', 'hour', 'two', 'one', 'had', 'exhausted', 'reserves', 'first', 'two', 'segments', 'body', 'was', 'BEGGING', 'protein', 'time', 'was', 'done']",10 Pounds DOWN: Better Body Blast

1512876,A14YIFT0GPF0IN,B0067SCZ4S,Jessica G,"[3, 4]","Jessica Smith has created a very efficient and effective workout that is divided into 3 20 min segments.Segment one focuses on an arm routine that is low weights and high reps and mixed with fun kick boxing cardio intervals. I found this work out to be fun and enjoyable and it really challenged me while doing it but I was surprised that I was not that sore the following day. The second segment for legs is the ultimate challenge for me and I consider myself to have quite a bit of lower body strength. She has created the perfect mix of lunges and squats that progressively build up in intensity. My legs are super sore the next day after this routine. I also find that my low back is sore and I would think that anyone that suffers from low back issues would not do well with this routine. The legs is definitely my favorite segment and I love the burn that this produces. I have a new awareness of my hamstrings and inner thighs. The final segment which focuses on abs is pilates based and combines simple mat exercises with some plank cardio drills. I don't really feel like the ab routine would serve on its own for a complete exercise day but I use this routine in combination with other segments (goes perfect after the 20 minute leg segment) or other exercise videos and it feels really good to end with this 20 minute core workout.I truly enjoy Jessica Smith.

1512877,A1EYVZ0P09BVEU,B0067SCZ4S,Katharine A. Draper,"[1, 1]","I absolutely love Jessica Smith and have been following her on you tube for almost a year.  I've done a lot of the free videos she offers along with her periodic motivational challenges so I figured this workout would be a breeze.  Well, I was wrong!  There are three separate 20 minute segments on the DVD (arms, legs, and abs) and as you go through the moves she gradually suggests ways to increase the intensity if you are up for it.  This is great for all fitness levels since you can stick with the base exercise or push yourself to include the other options.The arms segment is my personal favorite because she targets almost every muscle in a short period of time and does enough reps to make you feel it the next day.  She's sneaky - you don't really notice how many reps you're doing as she'll demonstrate the supplemental intensity levels while you're still doing the base move.  So you're watching what to do next and forgetting that your arms feel like they're going to fall off.  It will definitely get you sweating!  I like that she tosses in a couple bouts of cardio boxing as variation.  People have noticed more definition in my arms since I started doing this!The legs are a lot of squats and lunges with (again) options to increase the intensity.  It's intense but doable, although it could be hard on the joints if you have issues with them.The abs were killer as well - I definitely don't have six pack but I'm in decent shape and I had to stop a few times to let my abs rest during this section.  She has numerous creative moves so it's fun that it's not just the typical crunches.  I was surprised that I managed to (almost) get through this on my first try but it is challenging.This workout can be as intense as you want it to be so it's great for beginners and advanced exercisers.  If you're short on time you can just do one segment or if you want a well rounded full workout you can do them all.

On weekends I have the option for longer workouts, but Mon-Fri mornings I am VERY pressed for time. I am always looking for workout DVDs that offer 20-minute workouts, and I feel SO LUCKY to have found this one.Jessica Smith is a great trainer who hits just the right balance of chit-chat (very little), business (great cueing and counting), and encouragement (lots). Unlike some other videos I've done, there are no background exercisers, but Jessica demonstrates different levels of each exercise so if you need to modify you always have a choice. Each move is presented as a progression of two or three levels, starting with a basic move and adding layers of difficulty.There are really three separate workouts, complete with warmup and cool down.  If you had time to do all three together it would be a fantastic full-body workout, but even when I just do just 20 minutes on the arms or the legs or the abs I feel like I've done good work that morning. I have DVDs by Jillian Michaels, Jackie Warner, and Jessica Smith, and many of these moves, in each of the workout, are new and challenging but not impossible. I am so glad I ordered this one.My absolute favorite thing about this DVD is that when you pop it in, you don't have to suffer through a bunch of previews. Some DVDs from Jillian or Jackie have 5 minutes of previews and diet lectures and they won't let you fast forward or skip to the menu.

I do all three of them and get a great and intense toning workout. The moves are creative and fun yet very challenging. I have been doing this workout in combination with a few other workout dvds for two months and have noticed a huge difference in my muscle tone. I love her 10 Pounds Down Total Body Tune Up and Look Better Naked dvd and I will be purchasing all her other workouts as well. The best thing about Jessica's workouts are that they are creative and fun and the time really goes by fast. A lot of other workouts tend to use the same repeated moves over and over again, but Jessica uses original moves and keeps my workout routine fresh; highly recommended!",5,Jessica Smith is becoming my new favorite instructor,1335139200,"04 23, 2012",2012,775,"['absolutely', 'love', 'workout', 'dvd', 'broken', 'down', '3', '20-minute', 'segments', 'arms', 'legs', 'abs', 'do', 'three', 'get', 'great', 'intense', 'toning', 'workout', 'moves', 'are', 'creative', 'fun', 'yet', 'very', 'challenging', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'workout', 'combination', 'few', 'other', 'workout', 'dvds', 'two', 'months', 'have', 'noticed', 'huge', 'difference', 'muscle', 'tone', 'love', '10', 'Pounds', 'Down', 'Total', 'Body', 'Tune', 'Up', 'Look', 'Better', 'Naked', 'dvd', 'will', 'be', 'purchasing', 'other', 'workouts', 'well', 'best', 'thing', 'Jessica', 'workouts', 'are', 'are', 'creative', 'fun', 'time', 'really', 'fast', 'lot', 'other', 'workouts', 'tend', 'use', 'same', 'repeated', 'moves', 'over', 'again', 'Jessica', 'original', 'moves', 'keeps', 'workout', 'routine', 'fresh', 'highly', 'recommended']",10 Pounds DOWN: Better Body Blast

Upper body, Abs and lower body. The upper body workout has great cardio intervals that keep you sweating while you tone up all the major muscle groups of your arms. I really love this upper body workout because you seriously FEEL it for days after.  Within a few workouts you start to see your arms really firm up. The Ab section is awesome. Jessica is known for making really creative and unique ab routines and this one does not disappoint. The lower body section is a major butt and thigh burner. Give this DVD a try. I promise that once you do it, it will get a spot as part of your regular DVD rotation.
