Well, it arrived yesterday, so I sat down and watched it. After going through a half box of Kleenex (and I don't cry easy), I decided to watch it again. My wife was out, so we'll be watching it again tonight and it will probably grab me again. When I saw that it was 2 1/2 hours long, I was a bit concerned, but when the credits rolled, it didn't feel anywhere near that long. This is an excellent film. Low budget, but between the story, acting, and directing, you'd never guess it. I'm really glad I bought two copies, 'cause I'm sure one will never make it back. Somewhere along the line, it will disappear into the ""I gotta have it"" cabinet in someone else's home.",5,"If this one doesn't touch you, you ain't got no heart!",1319587200,"10 26, 2011",2011,723,"[""'d"", 'read', 'book', 'was', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'film', 'Well', 'arrived', 'yesterday', 'sat', 'down', 'watched', 'going', 'half', 'box', 'Kleenex', 'do', ""n't"", 'cry', 'easy', 'decided', 'watch', 'again', 'wife', 'was', 'out', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'again', 'tonight', 'will', 'probably', 'grab', 'again', 'When', 'saw', 'was', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'long', 'was', 'bit', 'concerned', 'when', 'credits', 'rolled', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'anywhere', 'long', 'excellent', 'film', 'Low', 'budget', 'story', 'acting', 'directing', ""'d"", 'never', 'guess', ""'m"", 'really', 'glad', 'bought', 'two', 'copies', ""'m"", 'sure', 'one', 'will', 'never', 'make', 'back', 'Somewhere', 'line', 'will', 'disappear', 'got', 'ta', 'have', 'cabinet', 'someone', 'else', 'home']",1 Message Director's Cut

The films creator and star, both had family members who were effected by breast cancer, as did many among the cast and crew. I think that's why this film seemed to have such a personal touch and feel throughout the film.The movie seems to take a little while to get going at the beginning but they do a wonderful job in allowing you to see the heartbreak, depression, and loneliness that Becca feels after being diagnosed and treated for breast cancer.It's hard to say that I `enjoyed' watching this film about breast cancer, but it was very inspiring to watch.I loved how with simple words written through emails one persons life helps to change another's.
