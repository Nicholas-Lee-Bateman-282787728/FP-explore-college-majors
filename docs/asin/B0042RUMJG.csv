The blue ray has exceptional video with crisp detailed views. From the opening number, I can count every scratch on the top/bottom/center of his fender guitar. Almost every angle is presented clearly as the cameras change viewing. As noted by others, the center channel is diluted to other speakers, but what they failed to mention, is that it is FEW! And far between that have it right on the DTS, I have to make speaker adjustments on almost all my concerts to accommodate these issues which you can't get it perfect this way, but you can get better--- unless you have a non- friendly amp/system. I even have to change the equal on a number.  OR,,, just take it as-is and enjoy. But for the 30 seconds to make adjustments that I have documented for each concert- well worth the time- they are not all the same- period.It is a dvd that you will certainly watch over and over again, my system his uses HDMI cables for all the hook ups. I note this only because some feedback leaves me wondering whether they used the proper cables- could of??? Just don't know what others do.  Using a Yamaha 863 receiver to power the klip's reference spkers. If you belong to Netflix, you should try finding your dvd's there for a trial test before buying.

What I like best about ""Live in Berlin"" is:a) Showmanship, staging, arrangement and delivery are stunning... Sting's use of a full orchestra (who artfully move along w/the music in choreographed sequence while playing, brilliant), adds layers of audio depth to his voice in a superbly complementary way.b) Dazzling camera work, the dp did a great job in capturing the performance with a variety of shot angles, and technically this is one of the very sharpest reference-quality blu-ray DVD concerts I've seen, of dozens.  Absolutely crystal-clear visuals... the camera work and image quality are outstanding.c) Hearing Sting perform favorites like King of Pain, Roxanne, and Every Little Thing She Does is Magic, plus his top solo songs was a lot of fun, having Branford Marsalis on horns was a big plus as well, they always work great together.d) Words that comes to mind after watching this last night are classy, brilliant, intense, fun and outstanding.I've bought dozens of concert dvds this past year, this is one of the very best; nice to see Sting in world-class form with the backing of a top orchestra.  This DVD sparkles.  Absolutely highly recommended -- thanks to all who made it happen, and Sting especially thx to you for all you've added over the years.

1383677,ACZE59375MYBC,B0042RUMJG,"Main Review ""Main Review""","[36, 47]","Sting Live In Berlin [Blu-ray]Saw this concert in person, so I looked forward to the same symphonic performance on BLU RAY. STING is great, and he re-invents his songs with the Philharmonic in wonderful ways. END OF GAME and ROXANNE are particularly wonderful. Also STING's voice sounds great and he delivers with range, power and endurance.The picture quality of the BLU RAY is very sharp, very video sharp to be more specific and gives you a true ""live"" experience if you are into that. However, given that it was recorded in 60i, not 60p (or 24p), it is not a progressive recording and you can see a lack of resolution and depth because of this in under-lit areas and wider shots on stage; keep in mind that your 1080p TV will render the 60i material as 60p but it would be best if it were recorded progressively to start with.  The camera work is slow moving or locked off and it works and the editorial is simple and seems to work as well. The color correction is very simple and they seem to have only relied on making everything look consistent rather than give the show a real ""look"" like the beautiful rich look JOHN MAYER got on his WHERE THE LIGHT IS Blu Ray for example.The audio appears to be well recorded and of high quality. However, the 5.1 audio mix is very poor: it sounds like all the audio engineers have done is give us a 5-channel stereo mix rather than a true 5.1 mix. In a true 5.1 mix, STING's vocals would be mostly in the center channel and the instruments in the Front L/R and the ambiance and crowd reaction in the Rear L/R, with low frequencies in the sub/LFE. But in the 5.1 mix provided every single speaker has the same audio mix coming out of it which sounds muddy and causes STING's voice to sound layered and echo. For better, cleaner sound, stick to the 2.0 Stereo PCM mix for this Blu Ray. Again JOHN MAYER got a much better sonic result for his audio mix on his WHERE THE LIGHT IS Blu Ray which is a reference quality picture and audio quality Blu Ray shot in 35MM and HD.Extra Features have an interesting interview with STING and Marsalis. All good here except they put some soft lighting filter (like a soap opera) all over STING's face for this interview which has been overdone for no good reason I can think of. I mean STING looks great and does not need a soft light to ""glow out"" his wrinkles!Overall it is a good purchase for a STING fan. But I wish they had taken the time in the on stage lighting, color correction and I wish it had a much better 5.1 mix for what was an amazing concert.",3,"Great performance, Sharp but boring Picture quality, Poor 5.1 audio mix",1293148800,"12 24, 2010",2010,2538,"['Sting', 'Live', 'Berlin', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Saw', 'concert', 'person', 'looked', 'forward', 'same', 'symphonic', 'performance', 'BLU', 'RAY', 'STING', 'great', 'songs', 'Philharmonic', 'wonderful', 'ways', 'END', 'GAME', 'ROXANNE', 'are', 'particularly', 'wonderful', 'Also', 'STING', 'voice', 'great', 'range', 'power', 'endurance.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'BLU', 'RAY', 'very', 'sharp', 'very', 'video', 'sharp', 'be', 'more', 'specific', 'true', 'live', 'experience', 'are', 'However', 'given', 'was', 'recorded', '60i', 'not', '60p', '24p', 'not', 'progressive', 'recording', 'can', 'see', 'lack', 'resolution', 'depth', 'under-lit', 'areas', 'wider', 'shots', 'stage', 'keep', 'mind', '1080p', 'TV', 'will', 'render', '60i', 'material', '60p', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'were', 'recorded', 'progressively', 'start', 'camera', 'work', 'slow', 'moving', 'locked', 'off', 'editorial', 'simple', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'color', 'correction', 'very', 'simple', 'seem', 'have', 'only', 'relied', 'making', 'everything', 'look', 'consistent', 'rather', 'give', 'show', 'real', 'look', 'beautiful', 'rich', 'look', 'JOHN', 'MAYER', 'got', 'WHERE', 'THE', 'LIGHT', 'IS', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'example.The', 'audio', 'be', 'well', 'recorded', 'high', 'quality', 'However', '5.1', 'audio', 'mix', 'very', 'poor', 'audio', 'engineers', 'have', 'done', 'give', '5-channel', 'stereo', 'mix', 'rather', 'true', '5.1', 'mix', 'true', '5.1', 'mix', 'STING', 'vocals', 'would', 'be', 'mostly', 'center', 'channel', 'instruments', 'Front', 'L/R', 'ambiance', 'crowd', 'reaction', 'Rear', 'L/R', 'low', 'frequencies', 'sub/LFE', '5.1', 'mix', 'provided', 'single', 'speaker', 'same', 'audio', 'mix', 'coming', 'muddy', 'STING', 'voice', 'sound', 'layered', 'echo', 'better', 'cleaner', 'sound', 'stick', '2.0', 'Stereo', 'PCM', 'mix', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Again', 'JOHN', 'MAYER', 'got', 'much', 'better', 'sonic', 'result', 'audio', 'mix', 'WHERE', 'THE', 'LIGHT', 'IS', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'reference', 'quality', 'picture', 'audio', 'quality', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'shot', '35MM', 'HD.Extra', 'Features', 'have', 'interesting', 'interview', 'STING', 'Marsalis', 'good', 'here', 'put', 'soft', 'lighting', 'filter', 'soap', 'opera', 'STING', 'face', 'interview', 'been', 'overdone', 'good', 'reason', 'can', 'think', 'mean', 'STING', 'great', 'not', 'need', 'soft', 'light', 'glow', 'out', 'wrinkles', 'Overall', 'good', 'purchase', 'STING', 'fan', 'wish', 'had', 'taken', 'time', 'stage', 'lighting', 'color', 'correction', 'wish', 'had', 'much', 'better', '5.1', 'mix', 'what', 'was', 'amazing', 'concert']",N/A

The camera work and video quality are stunning. And of course, most importantly, the musical performances are amazing. I am especially impressed with the orchestral arrangements and their participation in the performances. With many of the Rock/Pop performers of late who have added an orchestra to their live performances, they seem to be more or less just ""background"" sound. Or maybe an orchestral intro here or there. Not with Sting's Concert - here we have a case where the songs have been totally re-arranged AROUND the orchestra, and the orchestra is fully engaged in all aspects of the songs. Truly impressive work. The only small criticism I might make about the show is that I would have really loved to have seen Sting with an instrument in his hands more often. There are a few songs where he plays his Spanish classical guitar, and one where he's playing his old black Stratocaster. But for the most part these are strictly vocal performances on his part. Very good vocal performances, but I think he seems a bit uncomfortable at times not having his guitar or bass in his hands. He even has a tambourine set up on a stand to his side that he keeps a beat on - not that it's really needed with three percussionists on stage - but I think he almost seems to be hitting that tambourine in place of where he would normally hitting his bass strings or strumming his guitar.....a ""crutch"" so to speak.
