851130,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,B0002YLC24,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[0, 0]","Finally got around to seeing this, as I usually have an aversion to sequels.  Where the original ended in Wien in 1994 this picks up in Paris 2003.  Celine (Julie Delpy) still has the quirkiness, beauty, and naive honesty of nine years before as well as the non-stop articulate rapport and repartee with Jesse (Ethan Hawke).Because of the depth of conversation there is no sense of soap opera about it.  They still philosophize about life and circumstance.  Jesse is back in Paris promoting a book about meeting Celine (a touch of post-modern self-consciousness), and has a few hours with her as she explains why she never showed up in Wien for the date.  What bothers me about it is not simply that they didn't get each others' numbers in ""Before Sunrise"", but if she was that serious and couldn't make it she could have had a messenger or someone in Wien meet him or SOMETHING.Anyway it starts out predictable, but quickly takes some interesting emotional turns.  Though the ending is technically open, you can easily guess the rest.I know they made a sequel to ""A Man and a Woman"" which I never saw, but no way could it live up to the original as this one does to its original.",4,A Sequel worthy of the original,1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,1180,"['Finally', 'got', 'seeing', 'usually', 'have', 'aversion', 'sequels', 'Where', 'original', 'ended', 'Wien', '1994', 'up', 'Paris', '2003', 'Celine', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'still', 'quirkiness', 'beauty', 'naive', 'honesty', 'nine', 'years', 'as', 'well', 'non-stop', 'articulate', 'rapport', 'repartee', 'Jesse', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', '.Because', 'depth', 'conversation', 'sense', 'soap', 'opera', 'still', 'philosophize', 'life', 'circumstance', 'Jesse', 'back', 'Paris', 'promoting', 'book', 'meeting', 'Celine', 'touch', 'post-modern', 'self-consciousness', 'few', 'hours', 'why', 'never', 'showed', 'up', 'Wien', 'date', 'What', 'not', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'others', 'numbers', 'Sunrise', 'was', 'serious', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'messenger', 'someone', 'Wien', 'meet', 'SOMETHING.Anyway', 'out', 'predictable', 'quickly', 'interesting', 'emotional', 'turns', 'ending', 'technically', 'open', 'can', 'easily', 'guess', 'rest.I', 'know', 'made', 'sequel', 'A', 'Man', 'Woman', 'never', 'saw', 'way', 'could', 'live', 'up', 'original', 'one', 'original']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)
851131,A5N1HB1T4EKCM,B0002YLC24,A. D. Hill,"[6, 7]","I own few films on DVD, but this and Before Sunrise are two I keep and will watch again. I will preface this with saying that I can understand how some people will be bored, not because this is a boring film, but because many are accustomed to Hollywood effects and schmaltz.In our American culture of pathologizing and medicating all forms of unhappiness, Botox injections, obsessing with appearing ""perfect"" and spending more time communicating with absent people via mobile devices and online, Jesse and Celine's characters seem more authentic than many actual people because, flawed, vulnerable, awkward and broken, they still connect and make no effort to conceal who they are.Julie Delpy is stunning as Celine and full of very human contradictions. She is both graceful and awkward, idealistic and jaded, anti-pollution yet smokes, responsible and a dreamer. Many of the qualities we loved about her in Before Sunrise are still there; she didn't outgrow them but grew into them realizing that the struggles, observations and hopes that can make one emotional is what makes life beautiful. She laughs about all Parisians being unhappy, yet we get a sense that there is an allure in a romantic, intelligent brooding. She takes action by working for an organization similar to Greenpeace removing her from the category of whiner. Ethan Hawke is convincing as the smitten American; we see both the free spirit he once was along with his current, settled on the surface self.The cinematography is fabulous. It's not as romantic as Before Sunrise and has fewer ""distractions"" like the drunken poet and old fortune teller (except for the barbecue party in Celine's courtyard towards the end which was very enchanting), but still is full of Parisian charms and beautiful scenes.They are constantly on the move, turning corners, the clock also moving forward as they try and go back. It's an impossible feat to capture the past in real time outside of a book written by Jesse, so we are not allowed to get too comfortable. The slowly setting sun made me anxious and Celine keeps pointing out that he needs to catch his plane. Towards the end when they are walking up Celine's large and tall spiral stairway we get a sense of them rising above time, and they are both quiet as if aware that something big is about to happen.Like other reviewers have written, you can feel as though you are witnessing something real. It's a place on screen that takes you to a beautiful place inside and leaves you aching for more, from them, and in your own life.",5,A love story without chick flicky nonsense,1167609600,"01 1, 2007",2007,2543,"['own', 'few', 'films', 'DVD', 'Sunrise', 'are', 'two', 'keep', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'will', 'preface', 'saying', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'bored', 'not', 'boring', 'film', 'many', 'are', 'accustomed', 'Hollywood', 'effects', 'schmaltz.In', 'American', 'culture', 'pathologizing', 'medicating', 'forms', 'unhappiness', 'Botox', 'injections', 'obsessing', 'appearing', 'perfect', 'spending', 'more', 'time', 'communicating', 'absent', 'people', 'mobile', 'devices', 'online', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'characters', 'seem', 'more', 'authentic', 'many', 'actual', 'people', 'flawed', 'vulnerable', 'awkward', 'broken', 'still', 'connect', 'make', 'effort', 'conceal', 'who', 'are.Julie', 'Delpy', 'stunning', 'Celine', 'full', 'very', 'human', 'contradictions', 'graceful', 'awkward', 'idealistic', 'jaded', 'anti-pollution', 'yet', 'smokes', 'responsible', 'dreamer', 'Many', 'qualities', 'loved', 'about', 'Sunrise', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'outgrow', 'grew', 'realizing', 'struggles', 'observations', 'can', 'make', 'one', 'emotional', 'what', 'life', 'beautiful', 'Parisians', 'being', 'unhappy', 'yet', 'get', 'sense', 'allure', 'romantic', 'intelligent', 'brooding', 'action', 'working', 'organization', 'similar', 'Greenpeace', 'removing', 'category', 'whiner', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'convincing', 'smitten', 'American', 'see', 'free', 'spirit', 'once', 'was', 'current', 'settled', 'surface', 'self.The', 'cinematography', 'fabulous', 'not', 'as', 'romantic', 'Sunrise', 'fewer', 'distractions', 'drunken', 'poet', 'old', 'fortune', 'teller', 'barbecue', 'party', 'Celine', 'courtyard', 'end', 'was', 'very', 'enchanting', 'still', 'full', 'Parisian', 'charms', 'beautiful', 'scenes.They', 'are', 'constantly', 'move', 'turning', 'corners', 'clock', 'also', 'moving', 'forward', 'try', 'go', 'back', 'impossible', 'feat', 'capture', 'past', 'real', 'time', 'book', 'written', 'Jesse', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'get', 'too', 'comfortable', 'slowly', 'setting', 'sun', 'made', 'anxious', 'Celine', 'pointing', 'out', 'catch', 'plane', 'end', 'when', 'are', 'walking', 'up', 'Celine', 'large', 'tall', 'spiral', 'stairway', 'get', 'sense', 'rising', 'time', 'are', 'quiet', 'aware', 'something', 'big', 'happen.Like', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'written', 'can', 'feel', 'are', 'witnessing', 'something', 'real', 'place', 'screen', 'beautiful', 'place', 'inside', 'aching', 'more', 'own', 'life']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)
851132,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0002YLC24,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[7, 9]","I will be the first to announce that I was not a huge fan of the original film.  While I thought that it was interesting to see as well as an untapped concept in Hollywood, I felt that the characters were too forced coupled with a very amateurish and repetitive moments.  It was an average film that seemed to be lacking bits of the human element.  It needed something more.  At the time I couldn't put my finger on it, but after seeing Before Sunset, I could see what it was.  Maturity.  This may sound strange, but I felt that Jesse and Celine were too perfect in the first film.  They lacked connectiveness to the average person.  I couldn't see myself in this situation.  Perhaps if I would have seen the original film in 1995 instead of a couple of years ago, it would have been closer, but I just couldn't capture the moment.  In Before Sunset, I feel head over feet for both Jesse and Celine.They seemed to have grown and experienced a life that was all their own.  They seemed more passionate, more powerful, and especially more human.  From their first meeting in the bookstore until the finale in Celine's apartment, I was fully immersed in their conversation.  I wanted to know everything I could about both of them, and I did.  I loved hearing about Celine's passion for the environment, and Jesse's distraught marriage.  It brought these two characters out of the screen and into our lives.  Whether it was a scripted story or if Hawke and Delpy were playing off each other, it worked.  I witnessed in this film two people who were made for each other.  It was more obvious in this film than in the prior outing.What made this film work on such a higher level than the first were the actors.  They have grown and emerged as two important commodities in the Hollywood community.  This is probably Hawke's greatest performance in years.  His relaxed actions made us feel relaxed around him, yet quietly pushing for him to be closer to Celine.  His pushy sexual advances seemed less forced and instead more like honest love.  He looked and felt like a man that has been dreaming of this encounter all his life, and it finally happened.  You could see the excitement in his eyes to see Delpy again.  It was more than just acting, he put so much heart into this performance that it was clearly displayed for all to see.  The same goes for Delpy.  At the beginning of this film, I didn't like her character.  She seemed rough and rigid around the edges, constantly giving off that feeling that she was harboring a secret that she didn't want Hawke to know.  As her character grew in this film, I understood why.  She had a different life after the encounter than Hawke did.  While he still longed for Celine in his heart, he did move on.  She longed for Jesse in her heart, and to this day could not find anyone to replace his purity.  I loved Celine much more in the sequel because she kept us guessing.  Did she remember their night together?  Did she really loose her grandmother, or did she just not show up that day in Vienna?  Was the song just for Jesse?  So many questions left me wanting more and more and more.Finally, I would like to say that Linklater is growing with his films, and this was a crowning achievement for him.  He powerfully and delicately built a sequel that was for superior than the original.  He continued with a similar format as the first, but gave us stronger characters and another beautiful city.  The language in this film is intense.  Listen to the words that come from Ethan and Julie, they embody so much of our culture and our lives.  There were moments when I felt they were speaking thoughts directly from my mind.  Everything in this film was connected and worked to the fullest extent of cinematic possibility.Overall, this was a brilliant film.  Linklater captured the essence of these two heart-struck people and proved that it could be filmed.  This is one of the ultimate love stories that will remain on your minds far after the film is over.  The intimate final lines will continually reverberate as the best ever in a movie.  This was a huge step up from the original, and is one of the best films of the year.  If you were not a fan of the Before Sunset, I suggest that you check this out.  It is a mature film that explores the power of love in a way that no other Hollywood film could.  I would not be surprised if we saw the title of this film in the Oscar celebration this year.  Check out this film to hear social commentary of our lives, fall in love, and especially to see the beauty of Paris.Grade: ***** out of *****",5,I'm designed to feel slightly dissatisfied!,1100908800,"11 20, 2004",2004,4584,"['will', 'be', 'first', 'announce', 'was', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'original', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'as', 'well', 'untapped', 'concept', 'Hollywood', 'felt', 'characters', 'were', 'too', 'forced', 'coupled', 'very', 'amateurish', 'repetitive', 'moments', 'was', 'average', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'lacking', 'bits', 'human', 'element', 'needed', 'something', 'more', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'put', 'finger', 'seeing', 'Sunset', 'could', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'Maturity', 'may', 'sound', 'strange', 'felt', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'were', 'too', 'perfect', 'first', 'film', 'lacked', 'connectiveness', 'average', 'person', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'situation', 'Perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'film', '1995', 'instead', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'closer', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'capture', 'moment', 'Before', 'Sunset', 'feel', 'head', 'feet', 'Jesse', 'Celine.They', 'seemed', 'have', 'grown', 'experienced', 'life', 'was', 'own', 'seemed', 'more', 'passionate', 'more', 'powerful', 'especially', 'more', 'human', 'first', 'meeting', 'bookstore', 'finale', 'Celine', 'apartment', 'was', 'fully', 'immersed', 'conversation', 'wanted', 'know', 'everything', 'could', 'did', 'loved', 'hearing', 'Celine', 'passion', 'environment', 'Jesse', 'distraught', 'marriage', 'brought', 'two', 'characters', 'screen', 'lives', 'was', 'scripted', 'story', 'Hawke', 'Delpy', 'were', 'playing', 'off', 'other', 'worked', 'witnessed', 'film', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'made', 'other', 'was', 'more', 'obvious', 'film', 'prior', 'outing.What', 'made', 'film', 'work', 'higher', 'level', 'first', 'were', 'actors', 'have', 'grown', 'emerged', 'two', 'important', 'commodities', 'Hollywood', 'community', 'probably', 'Hawke', 'greatest', 'performance', 'years', 'relaxed', 'actions', 'made', 'feel', 'relaxed', 'yet', 'quietly', 'pushing', 'be', 'closer', 'Celine', 'pushy', 'sexual', 'advances', 'seemed', 'less', 'forced', 'instead', 'more', 'like', 'honest', 'love', 'looked', 'felt', 'man', 'been', 'dreaming', 'encounter', 'life', 'finally', 'happened', 'could', 'see', 'excitement', 'eyes', 'see', 'Delpy', 'again', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'acting', 'put', 'so', 'much', 'heart', 'performance', 'was', 'clearly', 'displayed', 'see', 'same', 'Delpy', 'beginning', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'character', 'seemed', 'rough', 'rigid', 'edges', 'constantly', 'giving', 'off', 'feeling', 'was', 'harboring', 'secret', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'Hawke', 'know', 'character', 'grew', 'film', 'understood', 'why', 'had', 'different', 'life', 'encounter', 'Hawke', 'did', 'still', 'longed', 'Celine', 'heart', 'did', 'move', 'longed', 'Jesse', 'heart', 'day', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'anyone', 'replace', 'purity', 'loved', 'Celine', 'much', 'more', 'sequel', 'kept', 'guessing', 'Did', 'remember', 'night', 'together', 'Did', 'really', 'loose', 'grandmother', 'did', 'just', 'not', 'show', 'up', 'day', 'Vienna', 'Was', 'song', 'just', 'Jesse', 'So', 'many', 'questions', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'more', 'more.Finally', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'Linklater', 'growing', 'films', 'was', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'powerfully', 'delicately', 'built', 'sequel', 'was', 'superior', 'original', 'continued', 'similar', 'format', 'first', 'gave', 'stronger', 'characters', 'beautiful', 'city', 'language', 'film', 'intense', 'Listen', 'words', 'come', 'Ethan', 'Julie', 'embody', 'so', 'much', 'culture', 'lives', 'were', 'moments', 'when', 'felt', 'were', 'speaking', 'thoughts', 'directly', 'mind', 'Everything', 'film', 'was', 'connected', 'worked', 'fullest', 'extent', 'cinematic', 'possibility.Overall', 'was', 'brilliant', 'film', 'Linklater', 'captured', 'essence', 'two', 'heart-struck', 'people', 'proved', 'could', 'be', 'filmed', 'one', 'ultimate', 'love', 'stories', 'will', 'remain', 'minds', 'far', 'film', 'intimate', 'final', 'lines', 'will', 'continually', 'reverberate', 'best', 'ever', 'movie', 'was', 'huge', 'step', 'up', 'original', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'were', 'not', 'fan', 'Before', 'Sunset', 'suggest', 'check', 'out', 'mature', 'film', 'power', 'love', 'way', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'could', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'saw', 'title', 'film', 'Oscar', 'celebration', 'year', 'Check', 'out', 'film', 'hear', 'social', 'commentary', 'lives', 'fall', 'love', 'especially', 'see', 'beauty', 'Paris.Grade', '*****', '*****']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)

Unless your a lemming to what ""modern society"" views are as to love (and progressive thought as a whole), you will not enjoy this movie.  There is no reality in the storyline.  To be fair, they lost me when all the bashing of the United States and the pro-liberal views of the characters were highlighted at the cafe.  I tried to enjoy this movie, and kept hoping for it to get better.  It never did.  It's not a movie.  It's a conversation between one man and one woman that takes place at a book store, cafe, garden, boat, car and finally, her apartment.  They are the only actors other than two or three minor others that have a line here or there, only for transition.  The whole production couldn't have been more than $100,000 to produce (that's being generous) or taken more than ten hours to put together.

851134,A2ELP13J2HSGJQ,B0002YLC24,AJ Denny,"[1, 2]","Released in 1995, Richard Linklater's ""Before Sunrise"" became a Generation X romantic masterpiece. It was the story of the one night spent together by chatty, heartbroken American drifter Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and vulnerable but opinionated French girl Celine (Julie Delpy). Walking around Vienna, they talked, making out with their minds, before falling in love.At the end of the movie, they promise to meet up in Vienna six months later. Instead, the sequel ""Before Sunset"" opens nine years later in Paris. Due to the death of her grandmother, Celine never made it back to Vienna. The next time she meet's Jesse is in a bookstore, where he is winding up the end of a book tour. He has written a novel based on their time in Vienna, and although at first speechless, soon both have a lot to talk about.The movie unfolds in real time over 80 minutes. As they leave the bookstore on the left bank of the Seine, the sinking of the sun is an element of time. Letting you know how much time they have left.Instead of filming the landmarks of Paris of Vienna, director Linklater show us wide shots, in front of or behind the couple. The streetscapes are pretty, and they make the time go faster. Building the suspense of the story.Celine and Jesse are hungry for news of each other. He feels trapped in his loveless marriage because of having a child. She is tired of been the kind of women who men thank for teaching them how to love other women. Delpy is hypersensitive about the deadline, punctuating her thoughts with ""You'll miss your plane.""Neither Delpy nor Hawke has done anything as effective since ""Before Sunrise."" Hawke has been the occasional success like ""Training Day."" Delpy's career has crashed and burned. Here, both off camera contributing to writing the script, as well as on screen, they work so well together you wonder why the film took so long to get made.The subject they talk about most is how in their mid-30s, they realise how precious time is. That regret is wasteful, and passion is always compromised by real life. In an 80-minute long epiphany they remind each other what by not again meeting again in Vienna, they learnt to live without.But they are talking again. With seductive ease, they navigate the new terrain of each other's heart.

851135,A2AVV9LV9UXT6F,B0002YLC24,Amazon Customer,"[11, 14]","Although artistic, indie films are not my usual fare, I LOVED this movie, as well as its predecessor, ""Before Sunrise"", which I first encountered on cable back in '95.  It was a great movie about being young and in love.  Two people have a magical night together, and plan to meet again in six months time.  ""Before Sunrise"" ended on that note, and being something of a romantic, I always liked to think they both came back as they promised, and got together.This movie finally answers that question.  A rarity among sequels, it manages to equal its predecessor.  ""Before Sunset"" follows the same format as the first film.  What makes it work is that the characters really do act like people who have aged a decade.  They're no longer college age kids, but grown, working adults.  In this film they talk more about their experiences than their hopes, ambitions, and desires.  You can see how life has worn some of their idealism off.  This is a great touch of realism.  They're the same characters, but their not really the same people anymore.Well, nine years after their romantic night together, we see that through no fault of theirs, their planned rendezvous in Vienna never happened.  They meet again in Paris, and as the movie progresses, it gradually becomes obvious that neither of them ever really got over the other.  Jesse admits that when he got married, he settled for what he thought would be good enough.  His marriage is not a happy one, and he has only remained in it because of his son, and even so, he worries about his son growing up in a joyless home.  Celine has bounced from one unsatisfying relationship to another, growing more cynical about romance with each one.  The only reason her current boyfriend is still her boyfriend is because his work requires him to travel a lot, so he's not around often enough to get under her skin like the rest of them did.  Celine candidly admits that she feels like she's dying inside, and Jesse tells her his life's even worse.Just as in the first film, they have only a short time to spend together.  Jesse has to catch a plane for New York.  But this brief time is enough to reveal that their old magic is still there, and you can see them falling for each other all over again.  As another reviewer remarked, those who say that this movie ended on an ambiguous note, as the first film did, are missing the subtext.  I think it is no coincidence at all that when Linklater, Delpy, and Hawke chose to feature a song sung by Nina Simone (in a scene near the end, when Jesse plays it on Celine's stereo), the one they chose was ""Just in Time"".  You can't hear the lyrics so easily in this film, but if you know this song (I do) you can see that it could be a Cri de Coeur from either character to the other:Just in time, you've found me just in time.Before you came, my time was running low.I was lost; the losing dice were tossed.My bridges all were crossed. Nowhere to go.Now you're here. Now I know where I'm goingNo more doubt or fear. I've found my wayFor love came just in time. You've found me just in time,And changed my lonely nights that lucky day.And when Celine, imitating Nina Simone, says to Jesse: ""Baby, you are gonna miss that plane."" He replies: ""I know"".  The way he says it, however, is more like: ""You're d*** right I am.""  They both let ""the one"" get away before.  There's no way they're going to let it happen again.Since Jesse and Celine do get their happy ending - or rather, happy beginning - in this film, I really hope they don't make another sequel.

This is one of those.Hollywood today is about glorifying the magnificent; magnificent action, magnificent characters, magnificent love. This film is none of those. This is as down to earth as hollywood gets without secretly filming your life. The long steadycam tracking shots; the utterly natural dialogue; the heartbreaking palpability of the characters' barely repressed passion make Before Sunset almost a voyeuristic journey through Paris. And yet, somewhere during the film (during the car ride home for me), this small story of an anonymous passion still managed to become magnificent.It was in the utter relatability of their interaction that enraptures. We've all spent countless hours in desk-thumping debate on the environment, or crying about the solitude of our romantic fate. So as they go through these stages of conversation it becomes brilliantly easy for viewers to relate and remember such moments they themselves have had. Coupled with that tiny fiction of meeting a dazzling foreigner on a train and spending a night together in Vienna, this movie was heaven; a dreamy almost-reality for those of us that wish for such charming moments in our lives. Watching Sunrise and then Sunset back to back, it killed me that they were in such a constant rush through Paris; that they couldn't spend another day in delightfully inconsequential discourse and liberating entwining of their souls as they did in the first film.But then again, would that had been the case, that still probably wouldn't have been enough.",5,not enough,1282953600,"08 28, 2010",2010,1605,"['put', 'succinctly', 'greatest', 'things', 'life', 'can', 'never', 'get', 'enough', 'one', 'those.Hollywood', 'today', 'glorifying', 'magnificent', 'magnificent', 'action', 'magnificent', 'characters', 'magnificent', 'love', 'film', 'none', 'as', 'down', 'earth', 'hollywood', 'secretly', 'filming', 'life', 'long', 'steadycam', 'tracking', 'shots', 'utterly', 'natural', 'dialogue', 'heartbreaking', 'palpability', 'characters', 'barely', 'repressed', 'passion', 'make', 'Sunset', 'almost', 'voyeuristic', 'journey', 'Paris', 'yet', 'somewhere', 'film', 'car', 'ride', 'home', 'small', 'story', 'anonymous', 'passion', 'still', 'managed', 'become', 'magnificent.It', 'was', 'utter', 'relatability', 'interaction', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'countless', 'hours', 'desk-thumping', 'debate', 'environment', 'crying', 'solitude', 'romantic', 'fate', 'go', 'stages', 'conversation', 'brilliantly', 'easy', 'viewers', 'relate', 'remember', 'such', 'moments', 'have', 'had', 'Coupled', 'tiny', 'fiction', 'meeting', 'dazzling', 'foreigner', 'train', 'spending', 'night', 'together', 'Vienna', 'movie', 'was', 'heaven', 'dreamy', 'almost-reality', 'wish', 'such', 'charming', 'moments', 'lives', 'Watching', 'Sunrise', 'then', 'Sunset', 'back', 'back', 'killed', 'were', 'such', 'constant', 'rush', 'Paris', 'could', ""n't"", 'spend', 'day', 'delightfully', 'inconsequential', 'discourse', 'liberating', 'entwining', 'souls', 'did', 'first', 'film.But', 'then', 'again', 'would', 'had', 'been', 'case', 'still', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'enough']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)

But if you've seen Before Sunrise you know that it isn't that simple. And even if you didn't you still get a sense of history between these two individuals caught in some attachment to the past. They talk about their relationships and career choices. They express ideas that they hold to about love, the environment, and religious experience.  It's like a deep conversation you would have with someone who was your best friend long ago. It's really an enchanting movie. And you find yourself caring about these people and what they think and do (something that is sadly lacking from a lot of other movies). In my honest opinion ""Before Sunrise""(maybe because it carried the energetic youthful spirit of the characters) was better but this movie is still wonderful and definitely more mature. I must add that Julie Delpy was totally realistic and engaging in this. I found myself like Ethan Hawke's character, who just observes how incredible this woman is. Celine is one of the better written female characters of movie history(IMO). I'm hoping that Julie Delpy gets a Best Actress nomination because she gave a very beautiful performance (especially the last scene.

851139,AORW1FRF4D4KS,B0002YLC24,azindn,"[1, 2]","One of the most charming films in many years, Before Sunset gives love a second chance with two enormously believable actors in their original roles. Reprising the roles of Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), the story takes up 9 years after they parted in Vienna after a one night stand, and the failed plans to meet again in 6 months, a semi-broken promise. But, for the couple, their paths cross again when author, Jesse winds up his publicity tour in Paris, and Celine, the environmental activist, attends his reading at Shakespeare and Co.If Paris is for lovers, the city is the stage for the duo to cruise its afternoon haunts and river as they catch up with their lives that have gone in diverse successful but unfulfilled directions. Celine follows her career to help environmental causes, but her heart remains closed and unwilling to open to another failed relationship. Jesse married his college girlfriend and has a child, but his dreams of something more still bring the memory of his unresolved relationship with Celine to his sleeping hours. What if is always seductive and so the reunited couple discuss what seems least important and hurtful in an effort to avoid the regret that seems to envelop them at every sentence.The notion of a second chance with the one who got away is every middle age and older individual's daydream, yet so few adults get an opportunity to have their dream come back in their life.With an abandonment of youthful pretext, the mature Celine and Jesse admit how the other was the innocent and most intriguing moment for them. However, they failed to act with foresight beyond youthful exuberance. In hindsight, they are both wounded or unfulfilled having failed to achieve what they held as the most personal goals -- that of meeting again with the lost love. Richard Linklater creates an enjoyable and mature film of resolution and renewal as the story of Celine and Jesse begins and ends at the exact right moment to leave audiences satisfied.Using both the on screen chemistry of his actors and the perfect timing of their storyline to resume the characters next move, Before Sunset is perhaps one of those rare films that is a better film than the first installment. It picks up right where it should with characters who have grown as individuals and through life's adventures, might grow more as their story continues to unfold.One need not view Before Sunrise to enjoy Before Sunset and the aging of its actors is both right and enjoyable. Hawke is not a boyish student, and Delpy is seductive with a French confidence that exudes sexiness. The film's locations, dialogue, and music by Delpy as well is just right for anyone who wants to step in the shoes of Jesse and Celine, and perhaps, take the next step along their crossed new path to happiness?

Though now that I've seen it, I have to say I am really happy that they made one.The movie picks up nine years later, where Jessie(Etahn Hawke) is doing a book signing for his first novel in Paris, where Celine(Julie Delpy) pops in. From there, the movie follows the same basic guidelines of the origanel with Jesse and Celine discussing their lives and things before Jesse flies back to the states.The difference this time is taht both charactors are older, less idealistic about love, and maybe even a little bitter at one another. We learn that they never got back togather six months later as they promised at the end of &quot;Sunset&quot;(this is not a spolier. Had they, there wound not be a sequel). But by the two of them being togather, they seem to want to recapture those days and ideals.And thats why I like &quot;Before Sunset&quot; better than its predesccor. Both charactors this time talk more about experience instead of dreams, and both come across as tragic figures. They had one shot at true love, but never really followed through on it. The dialogue, written by Hawke, Delpy and director Richard Linklater, has a realistic tone, and is full of humor that helps the more sour parts of the movie go down easier.Seeing these charactors again togather(they were briefly in &quot;Waking Life&quot; togather but...) brought a simile to my face that stayed for eighty minutes. It was like seeing two old friends again, which sounds weird I know, and just happy that their back togather.The movie offers up another ambigious ending that once again asks us whether we are jaded or a romantic.I really, really liked &quot;Before Sunset&quot; on every level.

851149,A3Q2NG43Q04PT3,B0002YLC24,Bulldozer,"[4, 4]","--Includes Spoilers--I've had Before Sunrise and Before Sunset on my Netflix queue for the past four years and just couldn't get around to watching it. Something finally triggered last night, and I finally decided to start up Before Sunrise. And, once I finished Before Sunrise, I wanted to know more about the characters fate? Did they return on December 16th? What is their relationship now? Have they found love? Before Sunset answers those questions, and poses a few more (one significant question) is asked about Jesse and Seline's relationship.The dialogue in Before Sunset is even better than Before Sunrise. The characters are older, wiser, and have come to realize that none of their relationships since their one night meeting have come close. They vent frustration and anger and sorrow. It's generally attributed that much of Hawke's own personal divorce from ex-wife contributed to this dialogue about his loveless, sexless marriage.The ending is ambiguous, but completely in character and consistent with the first film and the observation that Jesse points out about the three journalists: romanticist, the pessimist, and the hopeful realist. It's up to the viewer, whether he or she is a romanticist, pessimist, or hopeful realist to decide at the end of Before Sunrise whether the characters decide to make something more of this second chance at a connection.In this humble reviewer's opinion, Jesse and Seline do re-connect their relationship. In the van ride to Seline's apartment, Jesse vents frustration about his loveless marriage and Seline reaches out with her right hand to touch his head. Jesse continues to delay going to the airport so that he can spend a few more minutes with Seline. In Seline's apartment, he finally convinces her to play him a song-- which is a Waltz about their one night encounter. He plays an upbeat Nina Simone track. All this seems to be initiated by Jesse, but that last line by Seline ""You're going to miss your flight"" is one that she's repeated several times before. And, Jesse's very last line ""I know"" along with his subtle, tugging of the wedding ring shows that time will not constrain their relationship. As in Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, it was Jesse's time limits that constricted their relationship development. Jesse makes known that time won't play the same role. That's why I'm more than just hopeful, I believe they re-connect-- I'd love to see a third film that confirms that possibility.Camera work is excellent. Completely consistent with Before Sunrise, it is shot in real-time with rolling shots of the cobblestone streets, gardens, and the Seine river in the background. Fewer eccentric characters than in the first film. (i.e. ""milkshake"" poet)Both Hawke and Delpy have unbelievable chemistry. Their performances are believable. Seline has such amazing charm and her dance at the end of the film just can't help but make you smile. Jesse has grown up, and his romantic views, which were so prevalent in Sunrise, are subdued in this film. Instead it is Seline's views, her pessimism, her doomed romances that largely initiate the conversation until Jesse responds that he has experienced the same.At 85 minutes, this movie runs briskly-- but is compacted with such emotion, sexual tension, and character development and exploration that it just feels so satisfying. Again, like the first film, it's refreshing to see a movie that doesn't need to resort to showing nudity or gratuitous sex or imagery to attract an audience. This is indeed an intellectual, romantic drama.Highly, highly recommended.",5,Perfect,1312675200,"08 7, 2011",2011,3580,"['Spoilers', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Sunrise', 'Before', 'Sunset', 'Netflix', 'queue', 'past', 'four', 'years', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'watching', 'Something', 'finally', 'triggered', 'last', 'night', 'finally', 'decided', 'start', 'up', 'Sunrise', 'once', 'finished', 'Sunrise', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'characters', 'fate', 'Did', 'return', 'December', '16th', 'What', 'relationship', 'now', 'Have', 'found', 'love', 'Sunset', 'answers', 'questions', 'few', 'more', 'one', 'significant', 'question', 'asked', 'Jesse', 'Seline', 'relationship.The', 'dialogue', 'Before', 'Sunset', 'even', 'better', 'Sunrise', 'characters', 'are', 'older', 'wiser', 'have', 'come', 'realize', 'none', 'relationships', 'one', 'night', 'meeting', 'have', 'come', 'close', 'vent', 'frustration', 'anger', 'sorrow', 'generally', 'attributed', 'much', 'Hawke', 'own', 'personal', 'divorce', 'ex-wife', 'contributed', 'dialogue', 'loveless', 'sexless', 'marriage.The', 'ending', 'ambiguous', 'completely', 'character', 'consistent', 'first', 'film', 'observation', 'Jesse', 'out', 'three', 'journalists', 'romanticist', 'pessimist', 'hopeful', 'realist', 'up', 'viewer', 'romanticist', 'pessimist', 'hopeful', 'realist', 'decide', 'end', 'Before', 'Sunrise', 'characters', 'decide', 'make', 'something', 'more', 'second', 'chance', 'connection.In', 'humble', 'reviewer', 'opinion', 'Jesse', 'Seline', 'do', 're-connect', 'relationship', 'van', 'ride', 'Seline', 'apartment', 'Jesse', 'frustration', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'Seline', 'out', 'right', 'hand', 'touch', 'head', 'Jesse', 'delay', 'going', 'airport', 'so', 'can', 'spend', 'few', 'more', 'minutes', 'Seline', 'Seline', 'apartment', 'finally', 'play', 'song', 'Waltz', 'one', 'night', 'encounter', 'upbeat', 'Nina', 'Simone', 'track', 'be', 'initiated', 'Jesse', 'last', 'line', 'Seline', ""'re"", 'going', 'miss', 'flight', 'one', 'repeated', 'several', 'times', 'Jesse', 'very', 'last', 'line', 'know', 'subtle', 'tugging', 'wedding', 'ring', 'time', 'will', 'not', 'constrain', 'relationship', 'Before', 'Sunrise', 'Before', 'Sunset', 'was', 'Jesse', 'time', 'constricted', 'relationship', 'development', 'Jesse', 'known', 'time', 'wo', ""n't"", 'play', 'same', 'role', 'why', ""'m"", 'more', 'just', 'hopeful', 'believe', 're-connect', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'third', 'film', 'possibility.Camera', 'work', 'excellent', 'Completely', 'consistent', 'Before', 'Sunrise', 'shot', 'real-time', 'rolling', 'shots', 'cobblestone', 'streets', 'gardens', 'Seine', 'river', 'background', 'Fewer', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'first', 'film', 'i.e', 'milkshake', 'poet', 'Hawke', 'Delpy', 'have', 'unbelievable', 'chemistry', 'performances', 'are', 'believable', 'Seline', 'such', 'amazing', 'charm', 'dance', 'end', 'film', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'make', 'smile', 'Jesse', 'grown', 'up', 'romantic', 'views', 'were', 'so', 'prevalent', 'Sunrise', 'are', 'subdued', 'film', 'Instead', 'Seline', 'views', 'pessimism', 'doomed', 'romances', 'largely', 'initiate', 'conversation', 'Jesse', 'experienced', 'same.At', '85', 'minutes', 'movie', 'briskly', 'compacted', 'such', 'emotion', 'sexual', 'tension', 'character', 'development', 'exploration', 'just', 'feels', 'so', 'satisfying', 'Again', 'first', 'film', 'refreshing', 'see', 'movie', ""n't"", 'need', 'resort', 'showing', 'nudity', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'imagery', 'attract', 'audience', 'indeed', 'intellectual', 'romantic', 'drama.Highly', 'highly', 'recommended']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)

One of the bookstore audience--basically to paraphrase--asks Jesse if his character and the girl's (Celine's) ever meet again and get together?  Jesse answers that it is up to the reader to decide. An optimist will believe that they live happily ever after and a pessimist will believe that it never worked out between them and everything falls apart.  I believe Linklater/Hawke/Delpy deliberately left the ending up to the audience's interpretation, which I think is always an interesting technique.  The optimists quote ""Just in Time"" and the pessimists remember how Celine talks about being driven crazy by too much intimacy.  I'm an optimist, so I believe that they found each other again and won't let each other go so casually this go-round.

No such luck.It was just 80 minutes of ""peeking into someone's window"" and eavesdropping on a private conversation.  Rather boring. They both seemed rather self-absorbed and jaded. All they seemed to be able to talk about was their one-night stand 9 years ago, and how their lives (and subsequent lovers) had seemed meaningless ever since.Duh. Meaningless sex is SUPPOSED to make you feel completely empty and leave you dragging around baggage of the soul tie to that person for the rest of your life. Why do you think that so many people are currently yearning for the romance, the depth, the committment of courtships of yesteryear? You know...LOVE...not the cheap imitation - lust.  The kind of relationship where the couple give sacrificially for the benefit of the others in the family...never stab one another in the back...cover one another in protection...encourage one another to become a better human being...encourage one another to follow their (unselfish) dreams...stay completely faithful until death. If swans can do it, I think that it shouldn't be too big a stretch for humans.He complains that he has had to do things that he never thought he would have to for the sake of his marriage...light candles, read self-help books, go to counseling. Really?! Does anybody truly believe that those are extraordinary measures that a spouse should not have to take in order to preserve his family and keep his wedding vows for life????I wanted to toss my cookies when he justified his intention to dissolve his marriage. I wondered what terrible thing his wife had done to be cheated on and abandoned. Had she committed adultery? Become a drug or alcohol addict? Lost all of their money on gambling? Nope. It was because he didn't want to ""wake up"" in his 50's and realize that he had stayed married for his little boy's sake and had thrown away his chance for happiness with someone else.Why is it that the most self-centered, lazy people are the ones who are always abandoning their commitments in order to chase down some fantasy ""happiness"" that might be just around the corner? Don't they realize that happiness isn't ""found""; it is created with a lot of hard work and sacrifice?Someone that selfish shouldn't be allowed to breed. It's pretty obvious that he fully intends to commit adultery with her, and she will most likely cheat with him and betray her boyfriend. Charming duo! Maybe if I had seen the first movie, I would have had some sympathy for this couple and their yearning for what might have been.But on second thought...it was only sex with a stranger during a one night stand...so probably not.

Since then fans of the movie have wondered and ruminated about what happened to the two main characters. Did they meet up as promised or go their separate ways forever? Linklater and his two leads, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, have decided to revisit these characters and try to recreate the magic of this first film, so cherished by its admirers.The good news for fans of Before Sunrise is that Linklater, Hawke and Delpy are able to recreate the chemistry that their two characters had in the first movie. As soon as they start talking, it comes back almost immediately, as if they never stopped talking since that last time. Like the first film, Before Sunset (2004) is a dialogue-driven movie, effortlessly picking up where the other left off.""On the Set of Before Sunset"" featurette has Linklater talking about how he kept imagining and thinking about these characters over the years. Hawke and Delpy brought a lot of their own ideas and stories to the film. This was clearly a labour of love for all three as they figured that it would only appeal to the small following who intensely loved the first movie.With sequels there is always the trepidation of whether or not the magic of the first film can be recreated. It is safe to say that Linklater and co. have done it. Fans of the first movie will no doubt fall in love with these characters all over again as they talk and rekindle their friendship.

Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[2, 3]","""Before Sunset"" is one of the most unabashedly romantic films I have ever seen.Even in our age of full disclosure and no privacy there remain moments that this viewer, anyway, has never seen captured on film before.""Before Sunset"" captures some of those moments.Two adult characters converse. Watching them, you wonder -- and you know that these two characters are wondering the same thing -- where will this conversation go? Is it just an exchange of banal, prepackaged rants and scripts? But, the two characters keep talking, keep talking past rough moments, and awkward discomfort, and strange anecdotes.After a while of this, they come to say shockingly open and intimate things to each other.Before you realize that you've been swept off your feet, the conversation has become as intimate as the best sexual act could be.These two characters are using mere words to reveal hopes, and pains, and vulnerabilities, that we usually sweep from our consciousness, because the world has no room for them ... except during magical moments such as those dramatized in this film.There was one aspect of ""Before Sunset"" that didn't work for me. Ethan Hawke, especially, gives a poignantly visual performance. He says things with his eyes and face that he does not convey in words.Otherwise, though, this film is not visual enough to be fully satisfying as a film. Its charms and power are almost all verbal, all in the script. That being the case, ""Before Sunset"" would perhaps have been better as a radio play.The director cheats his audience; he doesn't care about using his camera to allow his audience to view Hawke, Delpy, their powerful and magic interaction, or Paris in a new and high impact way.But that's a minor complaint. ""Before Sunset"" swept this viewer off her feet. Days after viewing it, I'm still under its spell. It's appropriate that we understand spells as being cast, primarily, with words, with language.

851166,A2I2DE1DJUVQOO,B0002YLC24,DarthRad,"[4, 6]","This was one of several movies that I watched while stuck on board this long round trip Qantas flight.  It was without a doubt the best one of them all, just a terrific movie.I got the DVD for this movie and for ""Before Sunrise"" later.  Unlike most people here, I definitely preferred ""Before Sunset"".  There is a noticeable difference between the two movies, and it has to do strictly with the fact that ""Before Sunrise"" was a standard movie script, written by two screenwriters, while ""Before Sunset"" was written largely by the two actors - Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy - together with the director/screenwriter.It is quite clear from the background information available on the making of ""Before Sunset"" that an enormous amount of the  screenplay was taken from the real lives of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.Jesse is originally from Texas, so is Ethan Hawke.  Celine goes to the U.S. to live and study, so did Julie Delpy.  Jesse is in the midst of a loveless marriage - Ethan Hawke was in the midst of a breakup of his marriage to Uma Thurman at the time this movie was being made.  Celine stays single, having many male friends/lovers, but never marrying - this is also true of Julie Delpy.Although they both said at the time that they were not playing themselves, that Ethan's real-life marital problems were completely different from Jesse's, and that Celine was only an idealization of the real Julie Delpy, the similarities are striking.  The fact that they are playing characters so close to who they really are is what makes ""Before Sunset"" feel so completely effortless and free flowing, more like a documentary that is evesdropping on a long, sweetly poignant conversation between two real-life friends.Watching ""Before Sunrise"" after this movie, I could definitely sense that the first movie was more of a situation where two actors were just playing out roles written for them by screenwriters.  The conversations do not flow quite so naturally, with the transitions occurring more awkwardly and in a more artificial fashion.In ""Before Sunset"", Jesse and Julie are nine years older, wiser, and sadder than in the first movie, just like in real life.  Like most fair skinned people in their mid 30's, they have now lost the smooth baby faced skin of their youth and are developing the beginnings of wrinkles.  The sadness comes from their realization, and our realization, that all of the youthful hopes and plans and passion from their encounter in the first movie did not come to fruition, and that time is perhaps running out for them.One final comment - most reviewers who have commented on the ending of ""Before Sunset"" seem to want to believe that Jesse and Celine went on to stay together as a couple.I have a different take on this.  I think that Jesse most likely did miss his airplane and went on to stay longer with Celine than he originally planned.  I also think that Jesse and Celine did go on to become best friends and soulmates, but I seriously doubt that they would go on to live together as a couple or that they would get married.  No, marriage would definitely not be in the cards for the fiercely independant-minded Celine.Why do I think this?  Because, in real-life, Ethan Hawke went on to a divorce with Uma Thurman, and became best friends with Julie Delpy, but today, they remain just that, best friends, and they have not gotten married nor did they go on to live together as a couple.And more than anything else, this movie is but a parallel universe mirroring their real lives.",5,a sweetly poignant conversation between two real-life friends,1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,3519,"['was', 'one', 'several', 'movies', 'watched', 'stuck', 'board', 'long', 'round', 'trip', 'Qantas', 'flight', 'was', 'doubt', 'best', 'one', 'just', 'terrific', 'movie.I', 'got', 'DVD', 'movie', 'Sunrise', 'later', 'most', 'people', 'here', 'definitely', 'preferred', 'Sunset', 'noticeable', 'difference', 'two', 'movies', 'do', 'strictly', 'fact', 'Sunrise', 'was', 'standard', 'movie', 'script', 'written', 'two', 'screenwriters', 'Sunset', 'was', 'written', 'largely', 'two', 'actors', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'together', 'director/screenwriter.It', 'quite', 'clear', 'background', 'information', 'available', 'making', 'Sunset', 'enormous', 'amount', 'screenplay', 'was', 'taken', 'real', 'lives', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Julie', 'Delpy.Jesse', 'originally', 'Texas', 'so', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Celine', 'U.S.', 'live', 'study', 'so', 'did', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'Jesse', 'midst', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'was', 'midst', 'breakup', 'marriage', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'Celine', 'single', 'having', 'many', 'male', 'friends/lovers', 'never', 'marrying', 'also', 'true', 'Julie', 'Delpy.Although', 'said', 'time', 'were', 'not', 'playing', 'Ethan', 'real-life', 'marital', 'problems', 'were', 'completely', 'different', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'was', 'only', 'idealization', 'real', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'similarities', 'are', 'striking', 'fact', 'are', 'playing', 'characters', 'so', 'close', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'what', 'Sunset', 'feel', 'so', 'completely', 'effortless', 'free', 'flowing', 'more', 'documentary', 'evesdropping', 'long', 'sweetly', 'poignant', 'conversation', 'two', 'real-life', 'friends.Watching', 'Sunrise', 'movie', 'could', 'definitely', 'sense', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'situation', 'where', 'two', 'actors', 'were', 'just', 'playing', 'out', 'roles', 'written', 'screenwriters', 'conversations', 'do', 'not', 'flow', 'quite', 'so', 'naturally', 'transitions', 'occurring', 'more', 'awkwardly', 'more', 'artificial', 'fashion.In', 'Sunset', 'Jesse', 'Julie', 'are', 'nine', 'years', 'older', 'wiser', 'sadder', 'first', 'movie', 'just', 'real', 'life', 'most', 'fair', 'skinned', 'people', 'mid', '30', 'have', 'now', 'lost', 'smooth', 'baby', 'faced', 'skin', 'youth', 'are', 'developing', 'beginnings', 'wrinkles', 'sadness', 'realization', 'realization', 'youthful', 'hopes', 'plans', 'passion', 'encounter', 'first', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'fruition', 'time', 'perhaps', 'running', 'out', 'them.One', 'final', 'comment', 'most', 'reviewers', 'who', 'have', 'commented', 'ending', 'Sunset', 'seem', 'want', 'believe', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'went', 'stay', 'together', 'couple.I', 'have', 'different', 'take', 'think', 'Jesse', 'most', 'likely', 'did', 'miss', 'airplane', 'went', 'stay', 'longer', 'Celine', 'originally', 'planned', 'also', 'think', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'did', 'go', 'become', 'best', 'friends', 'soulmates', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'would', 'go', 'live', 'together', 'couple', 'would', 'get', 'married', 'No', 'marriage', 'would', 'definitely', 'not', 'be', 'cards', 'fiercely', 'independant-minded', 'Celine.Why', 'do', 'think', 'real-life', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'went', 'divorce', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'became', 'best', 'friends', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'today', 'remain', 'just', 'best', 'friends', 'have', 'not', 'gotten', 'married', 'did', 'go', 'live', 'together', 'couple.And', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'movie', 'parallel', 'universe', 'mirroring', 'real', 'lives']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)

I have some personal experience in this films subject, I experienced it at the young age of 18, traveling from Washington to California. It's amazing how romantic meeting someone on a train can be, laying in their lap, while they watch you sleep.Jesse and Celine met 9 years ago on a train in Europe. They meet again while Jesse is on a book tour in Paris, where she lives. It feels similiar to the first movie in style, as Jesse and Celine walk through Paris, once again verbally connected and experiencing no awkward silences. Though, this long conversation takes a different turn...You get to find out things that you weren't sure about in the first movie: about their one night together and whether or not they showed up at the train station like they promised. You also find out that Celine has a boyfriend, but Jesse is married with a four year old boy. Obviously, that shapes the way the story will end.As much as I loved the first movie, I realized that I didn't like the characters that much. In this one, I thought the characters were great. I realize how perfect it was. In their 20's, they were annoying, trying to impress each other with their knowledge and deep thoughts. They came to a more honest place in their early thirties, which made the characters more likeable. (Not that the characters have to be likeable in order for the movie to be great, obviously.)Some have complained of the ending, and yes it was abrupt and sudden, but you can reach your own conclusion, even though it is obvious.The director says in an LA Times article that he &quot;dreams of making a third one.&quot; If he did, I would definitely go see it. But, would I be satisfied if he never made a third? Yes, I think I would. It's something to dream and hope for, and if it comes true, it would be wonderful.Just please don't make us wait another nine years!",4,"What would you change, if you could do it again?",1090800000,"07 26, 2004",2004,1939,"['been', 'long-awaited', 'sequel', 'most', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'were', 'getting', 'have', 'personal', 'experience', 'films', 'subject', 'experienced', 'young', 'age', '18', 'traveling', 'Washington', 'California', 'amazing', 'how', 'romantic', 'meeting', 'someone', 'train', 'can', 'be', 'laying', 'lap', 'watch', 'sleep.Jesse', 'Celine', 'met', '9', 'years', 'ago', 'train', 'Europe', 'meet', 'again', 'Jesse', 'book', 'tour', 'Paris', 'where', 'similiar', 'first', 'movie', 'style', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'walk', 'Paris', 'once', 'again', 'verbally', 'connected', 'experiencing', 'awkward', 'silences', 'Though', 'long', 'conversation', 'different', 'turn', 'get', 'find', 'out', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'sure', 'first', 'movie', 'one', 'night', 'together', 'not', 'showed', 'up', 'train', 'station', 'promised', 'also', 'find', 'out', 'Celine', 'boyfriend', 'Jesse', 'married', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'Obviously', 'way', 'story', 'will', 'end.As', 'much', 'loved', 'first', 'movie', 'realized', 'did', ""n't"", 'characters', 'much', 'one', 'thought', 'characters', 'were', 'great', 'realize', 'how', 'perfect', 'was', '20', 'were', 'annoying', 'trying', 'impress', 'other', 'knowledge', 'deep', 'thoughts', 'came', 'more', 'honest', 'place', 'early', 'thirties', 'made', 'characters', 'more', 'likeable', 'Not', 'characters', 'have', 'be', 'likeable', 'order', 'movie', 'be', 'great', 'obviously', 'have', 'complained', 'ending', 'yes', 'was', 'abrupt', 'sudden', 'can', 'reach', 'own', 'conclusion', 'even', 'obvious.The', 'director', 'LA', 'Times', 'article', 'quot', 'dreams', 'making', 'third', 'one.', 'quot', 'did', 'would', 'definitely', 'go', 'see', 'would', 'be', 'satisfied', 'never', 'made', 'third', 'Yes', 'think', 'would', 'something', 'dream', 'hope', 'true', 'would', 'be', 'wonderful.Just', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'wait', 'nine', 'years']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)

Knouse,"[4, 4]","First off, if you haven't already seen the first film, ""Before Sunrise,"" also from director Richard Linklater, then stop and go rent or buy that film for a solid romantic backstory.  After that, this film is an excellent continuation with all the fantastic acting nuance and phenomenal chemistry that Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy still have.  Richard Linklater even used these two actors for an scene in the animated film ""Waking Life"" to great effect.  Most of ""Before Sunset"" is basically one long conversation between two former one-night-stand lovers talking about where they are now in life, where they've been, where they think they are going, what they believe in, whether or not ""love"" is a luxury they simply cannot afford in their now too complicated lives.  Ultimately, this is a very realistic look at intimacy, all the while hoping these two do end up together.  The only ""flaws"" in the film are two-fold(particularly for hopeless romantics): 1)the film is too short, 2)the film is very linear.  You want these two to go on forever connecting, all the while only a glance away from a passionate embrace.  By ""linear,"" I mean that nothing especially exciting happens during the film other than a re-awakening of long-dormant emotions let loose in the Parisian dusk through conversation and walking from location to location.  However, this is a very good film with some great chemistry between the principle actors, and an excellent continuation from the underground hit that was ""Before Sunrise.""

851177,A1AYEI2SNFPYES,B0002YLC24,Dogville,"[8, 9]","Before Sunset isn't only the underrated and hidden gem of Richard Linklater but also that of 2004. The simple reason is that this has to be one of the best movies of this year.The movie depended very much on Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy and their compelling chemistry is unmistakable. From the time they left the book store till the time they ended in Celine's apartment, it's 90 minutes of witty conversation that covered a wide range of topics from books to environmental issues to politics to love and life. There was never a dull moment because there's so much realism and bittersweetness in the recounting of that fateful night 9 years ago. And it's this night that had caused two long-lost people separated by time and distance to rediscover the love they had always had for each other despite the changes to their lives in those 9 years.Julie Delpy puts up a good job as Celine whose love life had never been smooth but still held deep love for her one night companion 9 years ago from which her memory could never erase. Her display of emotions are spectacular, culminating in the scene where she emulates the late Nina Simone's moves while Ethan Hawke was watching her. Her heartfelt rendition of the original song Waltz for a Night must have been the highlight of the entire movie.Ethan Hawke has displayed much maturity since Sunrise and playes a guy trapped in a loveless marriage whose yearning for Celine is so strong. When he cast his eyes on Celine, it's almost as if he had said so much to her when no words were even spoken. It's that look that transcends time and space.In the end, the movie isn't your typical romantic story but achieves its aim to touch one deep inside and ask oneself if one had ever known love like that. It doesn't matter how long one might have known someone but it's really the power of the being connected to someone wherever the person is that makes the difference.It's about re-living and -capturing that moment that will potentially fulfill an unended desire, knowing that without this person, your life will never be whole. That's what love should really be, perhaps. And yes, all these achieved without any sex.Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. Not just once. Each viewing yields a different interpretation.",5,Glowing Sunset,1099612800,"11 5, 2004",2004,2263,"['Sunset', ""n't"", 'only', 'underrated', 'hidden', 'gem', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'also', '2004', 'simple', 'reason', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'year.The', 'movie', 'depended', 'very', 'much', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'compelling', 'chemistry', 'unmistakable', 'time', 'left', 'book', 'store', 'time', 'ended', 'Celine', 'apartment', '90', 'minutes', 'witty', 'conversation', 'covered', 'wide', 'range', 'topics', 'books', 'environmental', 'issues', 'politics', 'love', 'life', 'was', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'so', 'much', 'realism', 'bittersweetness', 'recounting', 'fateful', 'night', '9', 'years', 'ago', 'night', 'had', 'caused', 'two', 'long-lost', 'people', 'separated', 'time', 'distance', 'rediscover', 'love', 'had', 'always', 'had', 'other', 'changes', 'lives', '9', 'years.Julie', 'Delpy', 'up', 'good', 'job', 'Celine', 'love', 'life', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'smooth', 'still', 'held', 'deep', 'love', 'one', 'night', 'companion', '9', 'years', 'ago', 'memory', 'could', 'never', 'erase', 'display', 'emotions', 'are', 'spectacular', 'culminating', 'scene', 'where', 'late', 'Nina', 'Simone', 'moves', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'was', 'watching', 'heartfelt', 'rendition', 'original', 'song', 'Waltz', 'Night', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'highlight', 'entire', 'movie.Ethan', 'Hawke', 'displayed', 'much', 'maturity', 'Sunrise', 'playes', 'guy', 'trapped', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'yearning', 'Celine', 'so', 'strong', 'When', 'cast', 'eyes', 'Celine', 'almost', 'had', 'said', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'words', 'were', 'even', 'spoken', 'look', 'time', 'space.In', 'end', 'movie', ""n't"", 'typical', 'romantic', 'story', 'aim', 'touch', 'one', 'deep', 'inside', 'ask', 'one', 'had', 'ever', 'known', 'love', ""n't"", 'matter', 'how', 'long', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'known', 'someone', 'really', 'power', 'being', 'connected', 'someone', 'wherever', 'person', 'difference.It', 're-living', '-capturing', 'moment', 'will', 'potentially', 'fulfill', 'unended', 'desire', 'knowing', 'person', 'life', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'whole', 'what', 'love', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'perhaps', 'yes', 'achieved', 'sex.Do', 'favor', 'watch', 'movie', 'Not', 'just', 'once', 'viewing', 'yields', 'different', 'interpretation']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)
851178,A29VKODW4R5U7W,B0002YLC24,dooby,"[7, 7]","I avoided watching this sequel until now, mainly because I didn't want to spoil the magic of ""Before Sunrise"". Despite the open-ending of the first film, I always expected the couple to meet again for their promised Christmas in Vienna. So to me the first film had a decidedly happy ending. ""Before Sunset"" of course is based on the premise that they didn't. Still I wasn't disappointed. ""Before Sunset"" is a lovely film, as beautiful as the first and ends on a suitably ambiguous and equally optimistic note. Filmed in real time, and taking place 9 years after the first film, it shows the pair meeting again, this time in Paris, the City of Love. Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is now a successful writer on a book tour promoting his latest bestseller, an autobiography based on their one night in Vienna. Celine (Julie Delpy) of course lives in Paris and comes to his book-signing. They have one lovely summer afternoon together before he has to fly back to America. Like the previous film they spend it walking, chatting, flirting, teasing and now reminiscing, as Celine takes him through the beautiful streets of her home city, including a picturesque boat trip down the Seine. Watching the film is like slipping into a pair of comfortable old shoes, or as others have said, like meeting and catching up with old friends again. The whole film is a single long chat as they reveal how their lives turned out, why they didn't meet before this, what might have been, and rekindle the romantic spark that came to life 9 years ago. The dialogue is witty and always engaging and you never want it to end. The chemistry between the pair is as palpable and electric as it was 9 years ago. All throughout you long for them to stay together.The script was written by Richard Linklater in collaboration with both actors which might explain the close affinity the actors have for their roles and the deep chemistry they exhibit. It's like they are not acting at all; as if we were given the privilege of eavesdropping on two close friends deep in an intimate conversation. Absolutely delightful. Can't wait to see them in another 9-10 years as they recount what has happened since. That would be a treat indeed. Both actors have aged visibly but they wear the years well and it's nice to see actors who don't try to disguise their age onscreen. It adds immeasurably to the realism of these characters.The film is presented in a modified form to perfectly fit the new 16:9 (1.78:1) widescreen TV. It is not in the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1 contrary to what is stated on the backcover. The picture looks fine and I couldn't detect any major composition problems. Colours are fairly strong and natural. Black levels are accurately set with good detail in the darker scenes. The DVD comes with the obligatory theatrical trailer. There is a also short but treasurable 10-minute ""On the Set"" featurette with the director and 2 stars talking about their collaboration in making the film and how they wove their own life expeiences into their characters' fictional lives. Good to know that another sequel is still possible 9 to 10 years down the line. Let's keep our fingers crossed.",5,Lovely Film... As Magical as the First...

851182,A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,B0002YLC24,Duane Thomas,"[9, 10]","Have you ever finished a movie feeling such immense affection for its characters you wondered what happened to them after the film ended, and hated that you'd never know? How rare it is to get the answer to that question in a worthy sequel. Before Sunset is that rare movie.In the first film, Before Sunrise, in 1995 two early twenty-somethings, an American boy named Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and a French girl named Celene (Julie Delpy) met on a train through Europe. After spending the day and night and into the next day walking and talking around Vienna, they were firmly in love, and as they parted at the train station promised to meet on that same spot, at 6 PM, exactly six months later. There the movie ended. As is pointed out in Before Sunset, different people react differently to the previous movie's ambiguous ending. Did the two young lovers make that appointment? Did they meet again, did they live happily ever after? Depending on your personality, some will say no, some yes, some can't decide.In the sequel, Before Sunset, we learn the answer: they did not. It's nine years later, 2004, and Jesse has written a bestseller about that one night, that special girl he never saw again. Then, in Paris on the last stop of a whirlwind promotional tour, he looks up and there she is. Celene, the girl who got away. Thus the two embark on another walking, talking marathon, in a different year, through a different city. But this time the stakes are higher. In the first movie they had most of a day to fall in love; and they were young, they didn't really understand what they had. After all, if this one love slipped away, surely there would be another, just as good, along shortly. Now in their thirties, they both suspect the sort of love they felt comes, if you're extremely lucky, once in a lifetime. Now they have only hours before Jesse's plane leaves to take him back to the US. (Apparently in Before Sunset-land simply taking a later flight is not an option. So in that sense the ""time limit,"" as in the first movie, is a bit artificial.) In that time they have to determine if fate dealt them a horrible misdeed, if they truly were robbed of their soulmate, if they're still in love, if they have a place in each others lives. And if this is true love, as rare as it is to find that in life, how much rarer to be given a second chance. Should they go for it or walk away, knowing there won't be a third chance?This is not a simple question. Jesse is trapped in a loveless marriage but has a four-year old son he adores. Leaving his wife to be with Celene would also mean leaving his son. Celene's had a series of horrible relationships leaving her almost incapable of daring to believe she could ever be truly happy, ever believe in love again. This is a woman with more than a few emotional dings. (Or is it that Jesse's primary problem with his wife is that she's not Celene? Is Celene's problem with any other man that he's not Jesse?)It's fascinating to note how from movie to movie the two characters' personalities have interchanged. In Before Sunrise, Jesse was the complete cynic, constantly questioning and popping Celene's starry-eyed, trusting worldview. Nine years later, the loss of each other has worked profound alterations in them both. Jesse's felt the lack of love in his life but it hasn't made him bitter, he's come to the conclusion the world just might be a pretty good place, he's much more ready to believe in true love. In the interim, Celene's become so afraid of being hurt in love she describes her current boyfriend's major positive trait as being that he's almost never there. The cynic has become the romantic and vice-versa.I might as well mention the one thing I did not love about this movie. Early on, there's a scene in which Celene voices a long litany of ultra-liberal, anti-industry, anti-gun, anti-good ol' US of A sentiments, among them calling the US an ""imperialist country"" and saying the only reason to be proud of being an American is the sexual staying power of its men. (Okay, I kind of liked that part, but it's certainly not the ONLY reason to be proud.) The fact that the expression on Jesse's face during Celene's angry, hate-filled rant shows he finds her performance charming had me doubting both characters' sanity. That scene really left a bad taste in my mouth. It was going to take an absolutely killer movie from that point on - great acting, dialogue, direction - to win me back over to its side. Fortunately, as my 5 star rating for the film shows, Before Sunset has all that stuff. By the end of the movie, I was just loving it, caring about Jesse and, yes, Celene as well.The idea for a sequel to Before Sunrise was hatched in the minds of director Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke (all of whom contributed to the sequel's script) before the first movie was even complete. Because they wondered the same things as other people: did Jesse and Celene ever meet again? Did they live happily ever after? In Before Sunset, the question is: how to end the movie? Shall we make a statement about the possibility of finding true love, or the nobility of self-sacrifice and facing up to reality at all costs? Romantic or realist? You can make a serious case for both. Some people find the ending of Before Sunset, like the ending of Before Sunrise, ambiguous. I don't. The answer is clear to me. After the final fade-out, I whispered to myself: ""Perfect. Just....perfect.""",5,What If Fate Gave You One Last Chance at True Love?,1116979200,"05 25, 2005",2005,5457,"['Have', 'ever', 'finished', 'movie', 'feeling', 'such', 'immense', 'affection',

851184,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0002YLC24,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 7]","I never thought 1995's ""Before Sunrise"" was any great shakes perhaps because the concept felt like a romantic conceit albeit an intelligently scripted one especially for a film about a couple of kids in their early twenties. Time has probably mellowed me, as I find director Richard Linklater's 2004 sequel an entertaining talkfest that pierces with certain life truths. Nine years after their life-altering brief encounter in Vienna, Jesse and Celine meet again in Paris. Now a successful first-time novelist on a book tour, he sees her show up at his final book signing at the famous Shakespeare & Co. bookstore, and after some hesitation, they pick up where they left off. Celine is now an environmental activist, and their conversation continues for nearly an hour and a half in real time, before Jesse is scheduled to catch a plane home to his wife and son. Linklater follows the lovers -- who had promised to reunite in Vienna in six months and never did -- from cafe to park to boat to an intense car ride to Celine's apartment. In a manner that seems even closer to Louis Malle's ""My Dinner With Andre"" than the first one, they spend the time talking about the passage of time, shifting ideals both political and romantic, harbored ambitions, unfulfilled desire, religion, sex and monogamy and inconsistent memories.Looking particularly aged compared to the flashbacks from the first movie, Ethan Hawke effortlessly captures the frustrated ennui of an unfulfilled artist, his romantic ideals reborn by this unexpected encounter. But it's Julie Delpy who more dexterously shows the subtle impact of her diminished expectations against her luminous former self, peaking with her visceral emotional breakdown in the car. She also shows herself to be a fine singer as she performs a plaintive waltz for Jesse at the end. The film is quite brief, just eighty minutes long, but it feels like the right length given the story's limited focus. Truth be told, there is still an air of self-indulgent pretension to some of their bantering, though I have come to accept the fact that this is a truthful aspect of their respective characters and the basis of their chemistry together. The fact that there is an easy, unforced air about their dialogue has a lot to do with Hawke's and Delpy's contributions to the script (they receive co-screenwriting credit) and with the real rapport between the two actors. The DVD is relatively short on extras, for instance, there is surprisingly no audio commentary track, but there is a brief making-of featurette that helps provide the context of the story relative to the previous movie.",4,Soulmates Intersect and Wallow in Thoughtful What-Ifs,1119139200,"06 19, 2005",2005,2624,"['never', 'thought', '1995', 'Sunrise', 'was', 'great', 'shakes', 'perhaps', 'concept', 'felt', 'romantic', 'conceit', 'intelligently', 'scripted', 'one', 'especially', 'film', 'couple', 'kids', 'early', 'twenties', 'Time', 'probably', 'mellowed', 'find', 'director', 'Richard', 'Linklater', '2004', 'sequel', 'entertaining', 'talkfest', 'pierces', 'certain', 'life', 'truths', 'Nine', 'years', 'life-altering', 'brief', 'encounter', 'Vienna', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'meet', 'again', 'Paris', 'Now', 'successful', 'first-time', 'novelist', 'book', 'tour', 'show', 'up', 'final', 'book', 'signing', 'famous', 'Shakespeare', 'Co.', 'bookstore', 'hesitation', 'pick', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'Celine', 'now', 'environmental', 'activist', 'conversation', 'nearly', 'hour', 'half', 'real', 'time', 'Jesse', 'scheduled', 'catch', 'plane', 'home', 'wife', 'son', 'Linklater', 'lovers', 'who', 'had', 'promised', 'reunite', 'Vienna', 'six', 'months', 'never', 'did', 'cafe', 'park', 'boat', 'intense', 'car', 'ride', 'Celine', 'apartment', 'manner', 'even', 'closer', 'Louis', 'Malle', 'Dinner', 'Andre', 'first', 'one', 'spend', 'time', 'talking', 'passage', 'time', 'shifting', 'ideals', 'political', 'romantic', 'harbored', 'ambitions', 'unfulfilled', 'desire', 'religion', 'sex', 'monogamy', 'inconsistent', 'memories.Looking', 'particularly', 'aged', 'compared', 'flashbacks', 'first', 'movie', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'effortlessly', 'frustrated', 'ennui', 'unfulfilled', 'artist', 'romantic', 'ideals', 'reborn', 'unexpected', 'encounter', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'who', 'more', 'dexterously', 'subtle', 'impact', 'diminished', 'expectations', 'luminous', 'former', 'self', 'peaking', 'visceral', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'car', 'also', 'be', 'fine', 'singer', 'plaintive', 'waltz', 'Jesse', 'end', 'film', 'quite', 'brief', 'just', 'eighty', 'minutes', 'long', 'right', 'length', 'given', 'story', 'limited', 'focus', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'still', 'air', 'self-indulgent', 'pretension', 'bantering', 'have', 'come', 'accept', 'fact', 'truthful', 'aspect', 'respective', 'characters', 'basis', 'chemistry', 'together', 'fact', 'easy', 'unforced', 'air', 'dialogue', 'lot', 'do', 'Hawke', 'Delpy', 'contributions', 'script', 'receive', 'co-screenwriting', 'credit', 'real', 'rapport', 'two', 'actors', 'DVD', 'relatively', 'short', 'extras', 'instance', 'surprisingly', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'brief', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'provide', 'context', 'story', 'relative', 'previous', 'movie']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)

Before Sunset is the second installment to a rather intelligent relationship of what were two complete strangers. The roles are played by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, who return after 9 years to share with viewers, chapter two of their romantic encounters.In 1994, Before Sunrise initiated with both actors reading books on a train ride through Europe. She sits close by the young American and after a few looks of interest, they engage in conversation, candidly sharing ideas, intimate views on life, and past experiences. She decides to stop in Vienna to spend the night getting to know one another. For the next 14 hours, Vienna provides a marvelous setting for their relationship and viewers take part on what is a wonderful tour of this historic city.Now, Before Sunset brings these two together again, after a 10 year span. They are reunited at a book store, where Hawke, who has published a book about their romantic encounter in Vienna, is giving a lecture on the theme of his book.They have just a few hours to spend together and this time, the setting is in beautiful Paris. You can sense unresolved issues of love, betrayal, abandonment, grief, guilt... but a certainty that the spark of love ignited 10 years ago has endured the test of time and is now an ardent fire of unrequited love.The conversations are intelligent, up-dated; their lines are written with great skill and engage us in topics that are foremost in our minds. It is wonderful to be part of the lives of two individuals, now for over 10 years, and hopefully with a third installment in the future, for the movie leaves us again not sure of where these two will take their love relationship.Jesse [Ethan Hawke] and Celine [Julie Delpy] are simply magnificent. The special features are great for we learned that the actors are allowed to write most of their own lines, their discussions now, as then, are centered around deep subjects we all confront at one point or another, and when Celine plays her guitar for Jesse... that only one song she promises before he returns to New York City... we know that if he leave her again... he is a fool, for their love is simply... magnificent!Don't miss it!",5,Awesome sequel to Before Sunrise...,1203811200,"02 24, 2008",2008,2267,"['found', 'DVDs', 'bought', 'Sunrise', '/', 'Sunset', 'together', 'birthday', 'gift', 'Sunset', 'second', 'installment', 'rather', 'intelligent', 'relationship', 'what', 'were', 'two', 'complete', 'strangers', 'roles', 'are', 'played', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'who', 'return', '9', 'years', 'share', 'viewers', 'chapter', 'two', 'romantic', 'encounters.In', '1994', 'Sunrise', 'initiated', 'actors', 'reading', 'books', 'train', 'ride', 'Europe', 'close', 'young', 'American', 'few', 'looks', 'interest', 'engage', 'conversation', 'candidly', 'sharing', 'ideas', 'intimate', 'views', 'life', 'past', 'experiences', 'stop', 'Vienna', 'spend', 'night', 'getting', 'know', 'one', 'next', '14', 'hours', 'Vienna', 'marvelous', 'setting', 'relationship', 'viewers', 'take', 'part', 'what', 'wonderful', 'tour', 'historic', 'city.Now', 'Sunset', 'two', 'together', 'again', '10', 'year', 'span', 'are', 'reunited', 'book', 'store', 'where', 'Hawke', 'who', 'published', 'book', 'romantic', 'encounter', 'Vienna', 'giving', 'lecture', 'theme', 'book.They', 'have', 'just', 'few', 'hours', 'spend', 'together', 'time', 'setting', 'beautiful', 'Paris', 'can', 'sense', 'unresolved', 'issues', 'love', 'betrayal', 'abandonment', 'grief', 'guilt', 'certainty', 'spark', 'love', 'ignited', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'endured', 'test', 'time', 'now', 'ardent', 'fire', 'unrequited', 'love.The', 'conversations', 'are', 'intelligent', 'up-dated', 'lines', 'are', 'written', 'great', 'skill', 'engage', 'topics', 'are', 'foremost', 'minds', 'wonderful', 'be', 'part', 'lives', 'two', 'individuals', 'now', '10', 'years', 'hopefully', 'third', 'installment', 'future', 'movie', 'again', 'not', 'sure', 'where', 'two', 'will', 'take', 'love', 'relationship.Jesse', '[', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', ']', 'Celine', '[', 'Julie', 'Delpy', ']', 'are', 'simply', 'magnificent', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'great', 'learned', 'actors', 'are', 'allowed', 'write', 'most', 'own', 'lines', 'discussions', 'now', 'then', 'are', 'centered', 'deep', 'subjects', 'confront', 'one', 'point', 'when', 'Celine', 'guitar', 'Jesse', 'only', 'one', 'song', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'know', 'leave', 'again', 'fool', 'love', 'simply', 'magnificent', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)

I love, love, love this movie. A sequel to Linklater's 1995 film Before Sunrise, it reunites the two lovers, Jesse and Celine, in Paris nine years later. The two have much catching up to do and only a little over an hour to do it in.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are both wonderful and really seem to be playing themselves rather than fictional characters and their chemistry together is great. Indeed the whole film feels like a documentary about the chance meeting of two lovers. One reason that I loved the film is that I really, honestly cared about the characters and I was very interested in where they had been and where they were going. It is a dialog heavy film indeed. In fact, it's almost a dialog only film, just as Before Sunrise was. However, every line of dialog is important and every word that is spoken matters because these words are all that the two characters are granted.The fascinating thing about the two films Before Sunrise and Before Sunset is that they are a portrait of an entire relationship. Two chance meetings, one over the course of a day and one over the course of an hour and fifteen minutes. That is Jesse and Celine's entire brief relationship.

In Before Sunrise, the first installment of this series, they are strongly drawn to each other out of mutual interest in one another, strong physical attraction, and, apparently, love.  But in this installment, the second installment, am I to believe that they end up back together out of...desperation...to escape all of the b.s. that is going on in their lives?  I'm not sure.  It seems to me the film could be read this way. If this is the case, then I'm not rooting for them to get together in the same way that I was rooting for them to get together in the first installment.Now what should I be expecting for the third installment (Before Midnight)?

Is it just a coincidence that three best films of the year all deal with ability to connect with other people, with meeting one's true love and losing it, with memories that will not go away, and with possibilities of second chances?""Before Sunset"" is one of the best sequels ever made but it stays on its own. It is so perfect, so simple, so sublime, so clever, so romantic, and so moving that it makes me happy to know that the films like that exist and there is hope that as characters get older we may witness their next meeting and conversations.Who would think that watching two people talking may be that fascinating? That's what the power of great dialog does. As much as I loved dialogs in ""Before Sunrise"", in this film they are even better - the characters are older, wiser, more interesting, I'd say. Ten years is a long period in a human life - our characters are still young and attractive but they've gone through losses and changes, disappointments and some sad realizations about life. It is privilege of the young age to hope that ""there'll be many people with whom you'll connect with. Later in life, you realize it only happens a few times."" If we only knew how to cherish and keep these unique and unforgettable connections. If we only knew that they were unique...Julie Delpy along with Ethan Hawke, contributed to the screenplay; and there is no doubt that their contributions made the characters interacting on the screen absolutely honest and believable.Julie Delpy gives one of the best performances of the year as Celine. She is amazing in showing mystery, charm, disappointments, dreams, and the dark sides of this woman. Her singing and Nina Simone's impersonation in the last scenes of ""Before Sunset"" are among the most charming and seductive ever - oh yes, baby you will miss that plane.4.5/5",4,"""I know what you meant for me that day.

It is to the credit of Writers Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy, and Ethan Hawke that the impressions of the film BEFORE SUNRISE made nine years ago made such a lasting impact on these fine artists that they were able to create this 'sequel' in a way that speaks to each of us about events and memorable past moments.Jessie (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) met in Vienna nine years ago and had a brief but romantic evening, ending with a pledge to meet again in a few months to recapture their night of love.  Circumstances prevented that reunion, yet nine years later Jessie, now on a tour publicizing his latest novel (one which uses his encounter with Celine as the core for his story) meets Celine again and having only a few hours before his plane leaves for New York (around sunset), the two stroll Paris, pause in a cafe, and eventually go to Celine's Parisian apartment where Celine is invoked to sing one of her songs that in her way recalls the affair of nine years ago.  Through all of this we learn how each life has changed and grown and how that 'before sunrise' moment altered each character's worldview.  And we never know if Jessie meets his plane!The extraordinary aspect of this film is the script, written in a manner that seems like the entire film is based on extemporaneous conversation.  Unforced, unfettered by traditional love story telling methods, this film relies wholly upon the interaction of two very fine actors.  The cinematography is seamless giving the feeling that the afternoon stroll and conversation was filmed in one sustained shoot.The DVD is greatly enhanced by a conversation - with Richard Linklater who brings the whole film into focus, with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy quietly demonstrating the depth of their talent both as actors, as conceptualizers, and as writers.  This is a thinking person's film, but that is not to say it is not a beautifully romantic film. It is as rare a treasure as, say, 'My Dinner with Andre'.  Highly recommended.

851197,A13TO5TU4A68LD,B0002YLC24,Gryphonisle,"[0, 0]","The first thing to ask yourself is:  Do you like movies where nothing happens?  Not even an argument?  That is this film---both of them actually;  A movie about two thirty-somethings who met on a train 9 years ago and spent that night walking the streets of Vienna, also doing nothing but talking.  Now they've run into each other again----he is now a married author who's written a book about that night, hoping she'd show up to one of the signings, and in Paris, she does.No action (save for some walking and eating).  No Violence, not even any arguments.  No sex or nudity.  Not for everybody.One can fall into using words like &#34;moving&#34;, and &#34;inspiring&#34; but one would be getting careless.  &#34;Before Sunset&#34; and &#34;Before Sunrise&#34; are at the drier end of RomComs, or as they're also often called &#34;Chick Flicks&#34;.  The conversations aren't deep, don't search out the existential questions or the order of the Universe.  In fact, as the characters establish themselves and their lives 9 years on from our first encounter, some of the conversation sounds like a laundry list of righteous Lefty do-gooderism.  One is caught nodding in tedium, &#34;Okay, okay, we get that, let's get on with it...&#34;  And then, they leave the cafe and start to walk and the movie is back where we liked it 9 years ago.  A nice, long, conversation between two people who clearly have deep affections for each other and official ties to two other people, lives that have become encumbered in the absence of a real connection between the two erstwhile lovers, and now they've met up again....Nothing is resolved.  There's a third movie (&#34;Before Midnight&#34;) set to premier at Cannes this year.  I'm betting that superfluous spouses are going to have died...This isn't the first film where the same actors have collaborated over a long period of time---&#34;Star Wars&#34; and &#34;Indiana Jones&#34; are two modern epics;  then there's the &#34;Thin Man Series&#34; that started out on the elegant side of the Depression and died a painful death in the wholesome homefront of rediscovered pieties during WWII.  Julie Delpy is an graceful older version of her girlish self;  Ethan Hawke looks as if he's taken up an entry level existence in a Charles Bukowski novel, between films.I like this concept---one slim story, the same two actors, one film every 9 years.  Something will probably happen in the third film, and if it doesn't wipe out the franchise, I can see watching this concept go on until both actors are old.  Will they ever get married?  Will that complete or destroy them?Hmmm.Again, not a film for everybody, but if you like this sort of slow moving river of a movie, you should enjoy this one (and you might want to check out Catherine Deneuve in &#34;A Christmas Tale&#34; which is a somewhat more energetic and spicy version of the same idea---not a holiday film by any standards).",3,"Engrossing Conversational Drama, 2nd of 3;  Not Quite As Good As The Original",1358726400,"01 21, 2013",2013,2921,"['first', 'thing', 'ask', 'Do', 'like', 'movies', 'where', 'nothing', 'Not', 'even', 'argument', 'film', 'actually', 'A', 'movie', 'two', 'thirty-somethings', 'who', 'met', 'train', '9', 'years', 'ago', 'spent', 'night', 'walking', 'streets', 'Vienna', 'also', 'doing', 'nothing', 'talking', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'run', 'other', 'again', 'now', 'married', 'author', 'who', 'written', 'book', 'night', 'hoping', ""'d"", 'show', 'up', 'one', 'signings', 'Paris', 'action', 'save', 'walking', 'eating', 'Violence', 'not', 'even', 'arguments', 'sex', 'nudity', 'Not', 'everybody.One', 'can', 'fall', 'using', 'words', '34', 'moving', '34', '34', 'inspiring', '34', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'getting', 'careless', '34', 'Sunset', '34', '34', 'Sunrise', '34', 'are', 'drier', 'end', 'RomComs', ""'re"", 'also', 'often', 'called', '34', 'Chick', 'Flicks', '34', 'conversations', 'are', ""n't"", 'deep', 'do', ""n't"", 'search', 'out', 'existential', 'questions', 'order', 'Universe', 'fact', 'characters', 'establish', 'lives', '9', 'years', 'first', 'encounter', 'conversation', 'laundry', 'list', 'righteous', 'Lefty', 'do-gooderism', 'One', 'caught', 'nodding', 'tedium', '34', 'Okay', 'okay', 'get', 'let', 'get', '34', 'then', 'leave', 'cafe', 'start', 'walk', 'movie', 'back', 'where', 'liked', '9', 'years', 'ago', 'nice', 'long', 'conversation', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'clearly', 'have', 'deep', 'affections', 'other', 'official', 'ties', 'two', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'become', 'encumbered', 'absence', 'real', 'connection', 'two', 'erstwhile', 'lovers', 'now', ""'ve"", 'met', 'up', 'again', '.Nothing', 'resolved', 'third', 'movie', '34', 'Midnight', '34', 'set', 'premier', 'Cannes', 'year', ""'m"", 'betting', 'superfluous', 'spouses', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'died', ""n't"", 'first', 'film', 'where', 'same', 'actors', 'have', 'collaborated', 'long', 'period', 'time', '34', 'Star', 'Wars', '34', '34', 'Indiana', 'Jones', '34', 'are', 'two', 'modern', 'epics', 'then', '34', 'Thin', 'Man', 'Series', '34', 'started', 'out', 'elegant', 'side', 'Depression', 'died', 'painful', 'death', 'wholesome', 'homefront', 'rediscovered', 'pieties', 'WWII', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'graceful', 'older', 'version', 'girlish', 'self', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'taken', 'up', 'entry', 'level', 'existence', 'Charles', 'Bukowski', 'novel', 'films.I', 'concept', '-one', 'slim', 'story', 'same', 'two', 'actors', 'one', 'film', '9', 'years', 'Something', 'will', 'probably', 'happen', 'third', 'film', ""n't"", 'wipe', 'out', 'franchise', 'can', 'see', 'watching', 'concept', 'go', 'actors', 'are', 'old', 'Will', 'ever', 'get', 'married', 'Will', 'complete', 'destroy', 'Hmmm.Again', 'not', 'film', 'everybody', 'like', 'sort', 'slow', 'moving', 'river', 'movie', 'should', 'enjoy', 'one', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'Catherine', 'Deneuve', '34', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Tale', '34', 'somewhat', 'more', 'energetic', 'spicy', 'version', 'same', 'idea', '-not', 'holiday', 'film', 'standards']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)

851200,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,B0002YLC24,Hikari,"[5, 9]","3.5 stars.  If ""Before Sunrise"" is as much a valentine to Vienna as it is a story about a youthful romance that only lasts one night, then its sucessor is a valentine to Paris, and what a wonderful Parisian evening it is to reconnect with an old lover.  Jesse and Celine, two young 20-somethings that met on a train 9 years ago and spent one magical night in Mozart's favorite city never kept that appointment to reunite on that train platform in six months.  Jesse, now in his 30s and a successful novelist on the last leg of his first European book tour, has never quite gotten over that fact, nor over the beautiful French girl who captivated him over all those hours all those years ago.  In a cinematic reunion tailormade for Paris, he spots Celine on the periphery of the crowd in Shakespeare & Co. bookstore and instantly is transported back nearly a decade.  Not that he's ever forgotten Celine--she is the heroine, ""fictionalized"", he claims, of his novel.  Time once again is a cruel mistress, as the two former lovers have just over an hour to get reacquainted before Jesse's flight departs for the States.Paris couldn't look better, but it doesn't take more than a few minutes to realize something uncomfortable: our two young lovers, no longer so young, aren't very likeable anymore.  Age and their share of mutual disappointments have honed the less appealing aspects of their more youthful selves into sharp edges.  Jesse has aged worse; Hawke's cheeks look positively gaunt under an unflattering beard, making his teeth look enormous, and his formerly luxurious head of hair is shorn into a trendy, but aging buzz cut. It is nearly impossible to detect remnants of the exuberant American boy Celine met 10 years before.  Delpy is still beautiful, but she looks tired and is noticably thinner, giving her a brittle aura.  This Celine has become the shrill and neurotic harpy that Jesse circa 1994 joked that she might.  Increasing age has not diluted our two protagonists' self-absorption any, but rather has only increased it to near-toxic levels.  It is a very awkward reunion, indeed, with both halves of our truncated couple nursing their private grievances against the other and dealing with adult lives that have largely failed to realize the promise of that night in Vienna. The stiff and careful way Jesse and Celine metaphorically circle one another as they edge tentatively toward bridging the gap of 9 years' worth of time and separate histories in an hour feels real--this project deserves kudos for staying far away from the temptation to make this reunion conform to Hollywood standards of a 'romantic ending'.  Indeed, our two former lovers feel as ambivilent about each other as we do.  Should they, can they, even attempt to reconnect when they still have the problem of continents and an ocean between them?  And, of course, there is the small matter of Jesse's wife and son back home.After a coffee, a stroll, a ride on the Seine & a tense conversation in a town car, our boy and girl arrive at Celine's door.  She invites him in, gives him tea, and a song and dances to Nina Simone on the CD player.  Her last line is ""Baby, you're gonna miss that plane.""  Do they stick together for good this time, or will it be ""Before Sunrise, Part Deux""?  It is left for the viewer to decide.  Jesse and Celine's rocky romance just may be the last one of its kind put to screen; after all, in this electronic age, with the Internet, Facebook, ubiquitous cell phones, texting and GPS, would it be possible to remain undiscovered by an earnest lover even if you didn't want to be found?  Had Jesse and Celine met just a few years later, it seems inconceivable that they wouldn't have kept in touch by text and Skype for all that time, their electronic connection no doubt becoming as commonplace and dull as they feared it would.  In the end, the lesson our two lovers leave us with is this: if you love someone, don't hold back.  Communicate.  Tell them exactly what is on your mind (and how they can reach you).  The regrets to keeping things to yourself could be too heavy to carry around for a lifetime otherwise.",3,Remembrance of Things Past,1269820800,"03 29, 2010",2010,4138,"['3.5', 'stars', 'Sunrise', 'as', 'much', 'valentine', 'Vienna', 'story', 'youthful', 'romance', 'only', 'one', 'night', 'then', 'sucessor', 'valentine', 'Paris', 'what', 'wonderful', 'Parisian', 'evening', 'reconnect', 'old', 'lover', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'two', 'young', '20-somethings', 'met', 'train', '9', 'years', 'ago', 'spent', 'one', 'magical', 'night', 'Mozart', 'favorite', 'city', 'never', 'kept', 'appointment', 'reunite', 'train', 'platform', 'six', 'months', 'Jesse', 'now', '30s', 'successful', 'novelist', 'last', 'leg', 'first', 'European', 'book', 'tour', 'never', 'quite', 'gotten', 'over', 'fact', 'beautiful', 'French', 'girl', 'who', 'captivated', 'hours', 'years', 'ago', 'cinematic', 'reunion', 'tailormade', 'Paris', 'Celine', 'periphery', 'crowd', 'Shakespeare', 'Co.', 'bookstore', 'instantly', 'transported', 'back', 'nearly', 'decade', 'Not', 'ever', 'forgotten', 'Celine', 'heroine', 'fictionalized', 'novel', 'Time', 'once', 'again', 'cruel', 'mistress', 'two', 'former', 'lovers', 'have', 'just', 'hour', 'get', 'reacquainted', 'Jesse', 'flight', 'departs', 'States.Paris', 'could', ""n't"", 'look', 'better', ""n't"", 'take', 'more', 'few', 'minutes', 'realize', 'something', 'uncomfortable', 'two', 'young', 'lovers', 'no', 'longer', 'so', 'young', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'likeable', 'anymore', 'Age', 'share', 'mutual', 'disappointments', 'have', 'honed', 'less', 'appealing', 'aspects', 'more', 'youthful', 'selves', 'sharp', 'edges', 'Jesse', 'aged', 'worse', 'Hawke', 'cheeks', 'look', 'positively', 'gaunt', 'unflattering', 'beard', 'making', 'teeth', 'look', 'enormous', 'formerly', 'luxurious', 'head', 'hair', 'shorn', 'trendy', 'aging', 'buzz', 'cut', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'detect', 'remnants', 'exuberant', 'American', 'boy', 'Celine', 'met', '10', 'years', 'before', 'Delpy', 'still', 'beautiful', 'tired', 'noticably', 'thinner', 'giving', 'brittle', 'aura', 'Celine', 'become', 'shrill', 'neurotic', 'harpy', 'Jesse', 'circa', '1994', 'joked', 'might', 'Increasing', 'age', 'not', 'diluted', 'two', 'protagonists', 'self-absorption', 'rather', 'only', 'increased', 'near-toxic', 'levels', 'very', 'awkward', 'reunion', 'indeed', 'halves', 'truncated', 'couple', 'nursing', 'private', 'grievances', 'other', 'dealing', 'adult', 'lives', 'have', 'largely', 'failed', 'realize', 'promise', 'night', 'Vienna', 'stiff', 'careful', 'way', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'metaphorically', 'one', 'edge', 'tentatively', 'bridging', 'gap', '9', 'years', 'worth', 'time', 'separate', 'histories', 'hour', 'feels', 'real', 'project', 'kudos', 'staying', 'far', 'away', 'temptation', 'make', 'reunion', 'conform', 'Hollywood', 'standards', ""'romantic"", 'ending', 'Indeed', 'two', 'former', 'lovers', 'feel', 'ambivilent', 'other', 'do', 'Should', 'can', 'even', 'attempt', 'reconnect', 'when', 'still', 'have', 'problem', 'continents', 'ocean', 'course', 'small', 'matter', 'Jesse', 'wife', 'son', 'back', 'home.After', 'coffee', 'stroll', 'ride', 'Seine', 'tense', 'conversation', 'town', 'car', 'boy', 'girl', 'arrive', 'Celine', 'door', 'tea', 'song', 'dances', 'Nina', 'Simone', 'CD', 'player', 'last', 'line', 'Baby', ""'re"", 'gon', 'miss', 'plane', 'Do', 'stick', 'together', 'good', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'Sunrise', 'Part', 'Deux', 'left', 'viewer', 'decide', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'rocky', 'romance', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'last', 'one', 'kind', 'put', 'screen', 'electronic', 'age', 'Internet', 'Facebook', 'ubiquitous', 'cell', 'phones', 'texting', 'GPS', 'would', 'be', 'possible', 'remain', 'undiscovered', 'earnest', 'lover', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'found', 'Had', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'met', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'inconceivable', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'kept', 'touch', 'text', 'Skype', 'time', 'electronic', 'connection', 'doubt', 'becoming', 'commonplace', 'dull', 'feared', 'would', 'end', 'lesson', 'two', 'lovers', 'leave', 'love', 'someone', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'Communicate', 'Tell', 'exactly', 'what', 'mind', 'how', 'can', 'reach', 'regrets', 'keeping', 'things', 'yourself', 'could', 'be', 'too', 'heavy', 'carry', 'around', 'lifetime', 'otherwise']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)

851211,A1WI6S60M5AS87,B0002YLC24,"J. Lopez ""Jen_1013""","[1, 1]","I first watched Before Sunrise in 1995 when I was just 13 years old. I loved it, even if I didn't completely understand the implications of the conversations between the 23 year old college students. Before Sunrise was a movie about American Jesse and French Celine who meet on a train and enjoy each other's company so much they decide to continue their journey in Vienna for the night, before Jesse has to leave for America the next morning. It's about two people meeting, making a connection, and in one night, falling in love. I hated and loved the open ending of the two of them promising to meet each other on December 16 six months later.Fast forward to 2004 and I'm (then) 24 years old and seeing a preview for Before Sunset. I'd forgotten about Before Sunrise, but watching that preview reminded me instantly. Much like the characters, I'd fallen in love and wanted to know more.In Before Sunset, Jesse and Celine meet up again, this time in Paris, as Jesse is promoting his book, a novel, a memoir based off their one night together nine years before. Key questions get answered: Did they meet again December 16 all those years ago? What have their lives been like? How are they different NOW than they were when they were hopeful and young? How has the last nine years changed them, and their outlooks on life?Set against the backdrop of Paris (Richard Linklater, Ethan, and Julie really did film there), the story is romantic and beautiful, and the viewer (I sure did) feels like they've reunited with old friends. Although Jesse and Celine are the stars of the movie, I feel that Paris was a silent cast member as well, quietly there in the background so you got a hint of her beauty. The film is shot in long sequences, long minutes of dialogue and every word and gesture feels like you're not watching a movie, but instead, as Jesse says at the beginning, ""you're there, you're in that moment"" and it's just so...natural. It's a heartbreakingly beautiful movie.That said, if 'conversation' movies aren't your thing, you'll not like Before Sunset, or Before Sunrise for that matter. Which is a shame, because they're two beautiful films. If you do love Before Sunrise and haven't seen Sunset yet, I recommend re-watching Sunrise. And then after watching Sunset, re-watching them again. Because it's absolutely fascinating to see how their outlooks on life have changed over nine years, their philosophies and views are vastly different between 1995 and 2004. It's a wonderful treat.SPOILER ALERT!!!! READ AT YOUR OWN RISK:***Ok, so for those of you who have watched the movie, I loved the ending. Yes it was open-ended, but in my opinion, with Celine's sly ""baby you are going to miss that plane"" and Jesse's ""I know"" and that little laugh, I think he stayed, and he decided he wasn't going to go back to his ""pretense of a marriage.""Which is why I'm terrified and elated at once that the Trio are getting back together to write, direct, produce, and film a new ""Before"" film.... I don't want to find out they didn't stay together and at the same time I really want to revisit these characters! How can it get better than Sunset? :(",5,Sublime. Utter perfection.

851214,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B0002YLC24,John Kwok,"[3, 6]","""Before Sunset"" is a beautiful, well-crafted sequel to ""Before Sunrise"", that holds well on its own even if you didn't see the original film chronicling the romantic adventure undertaken by Jesse and Celine. It's nine years later and Jesse is now a succesful American novelist at the final stop of his European book tour, Paris' Shakespeare and Company. Much to his amazement he sees Celine, and realizes that he still has a deep romantic feeling for the beautiful French girl that he had won, and then lost. With only a little more than an hour to spare before Jesse heads to the airport for his flight bound for home, he joins Celine in remembering their adventure and warm, intense feelings which each still has for the other. Director Richard Linklater - working from a screenplay co-written by himself, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke - has wrought yet another cinematic gem that is a romantic version of ""My Dinner With Andre"", showing in real-time how Jesse and Celine stumble at first with their words, before gradually realizing how strong their passion remains for the other. This builds up into a surprising, unexpected climax which is truly a perfect, elegant ending for this sweet cinematic ode to love. The film is accompanied by several stirring love songs in French and English composed and sung by Julie Delpy herself. Both Hawke and Delpy distinguish themselves in their performances, and yet, I can't help but notice how radiantly beautiful Delpy is, as the insecure, but brilliant, Celine (For Ms. Delpy, all I can say, is je t'aime.).

Their acting is so realistic that I yearned for them to get married. Mind you, I'm usually a sucker for sad endings. Real life & fiction collide here, cos you know both have their own separate lives, & will move on to other projects, possibly lives.The second time I watched it, I felt so depressed yet emotionally touched/concerned/caring & melting for their plights. Both actors will move on & star in other movies...yet this agnostic Freudian unconsciously prayed to God those dancing scenes at the end of the film would be somehow crystallised in stone/painting to symbolise true friendship & all the real love overflowing after: so everybody could discern or get a nourishing sample of it.There's so much philosophy, comedy & looser Zeitgeist commentary/language (urban-vulgar) used this time to appeal to the modern market of filmgoers. But I think this film is geared for the fans of the first film. Ms or Mrs (I don't know which) Delpy, your ''Waltz'' song at the end was divine & I a 30yo aspiring amateur singer/songwriter feel jealous of your voice, capabilities, guitar playing & tunesmithship.The sincere boyish unabashed look on 'hero' Ethan Hawke's (who did manage to write a bestseller to enable their reunion - who needs 'Dark Knight Batman'?) face at the time, as well obviously the heroine in Julie Delpy makes me realise even more that time is short, & the looks, moreover energy we're graced with in our years before grey hair & old age must be stored/utilised/documented in some photo, song, poem to preserve it as long as possible.I hasten to add that we should aim high (goal-wise) so you can live out your dreams, as Hawke called Delpy an 'angry manic depressive activist' in the limo - something my unstable nature could relate to (but not the former opening paragraph statement). Hell, even Hawke's anecdote on the ferry (amazing France & great cinematography!) about one German soldier not destroying beautiful monuments/buildings of Paris in WWII (with an unpressed explosive trigger) made history sound so poetic & graceful...when normally it & science I would look at with skepticsm & the cause of society's ills today.",5,My time is running low...[End Credits],1304294400,"05 2, 2011",2011,2329,"['Hawke', 'Delpy', 'were', 'actors', 'prime', 'adulthood', 'looks', 'charisma', 'intelligence', 'most', 'soul', 'production', 'release', 'film', 'decade', 'ago', 'acting', 'so', 'realistic', 'yearned', 'get', 'married', 'Mind', ""'m"", 'usually', 'sucker', 'sad', 'endings', 'Real', 'life', 'fiction', 'collide', 'here', 'cos', 'know', 'have', 'own', 'separate', 'lives', 'will', 'move', 'other', 'projects', 'possibly', 'lives.The', 'second', 'time', 'watched', 'felt', 'so', 'depressed', 'yet', 'emotionally', 'touched/concerned/caring', 'melting', 'plights', 'actors', 'will', 'move', 'star', 'other', 'movies', 'yet', 'agnostic', 'Freudian', 'unconsciously', 'prayed', 'God', 'dancing', 'scenes', 'end', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'somehow', 'crystallised', 'stone/painting', 'symbolise', 'true', 'friendship', 'real', 'love', 'overflowing', 'so', 'everybody', 'could', 'discern', 'get', 'nourishing', 'sample', 'it.There', 'so', 'much', 'philosophy', 'comedy', 'looser', 'Zeitgeist', 'commentary/language', 'urban-vulgar', 'used', 'time', 'appeal', 'modern', 'market', 'filmgoers', 'think', 'film', 'geared', 'fans', 'first', 'film', 'Ms', 'Mrs', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Delpy', 'Waltz', 'song', 'end', 'was', 'divine', '30yo', 'aspiring', 'amateur', 'singer/songwriter', 'feel', 'jealous', 'voice', 'capabilities', 'guitar', 'playing', 'tunesmithship.The', 'sincere', 'boyish', 'unabashed', 'look', ""'hero"", 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'who', 'did', 'manage', 'write', 'bestseller', 'enable', 'reunion', 'who', ""'Dark"", 'Knight', 'Batman', 'face', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'obviously', 'heroine', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'realise', 'even', 'more', 'time', 'short', 'looks', 'moreover', 'energy', ""'re"", 'graced', 'years', 'grey', 'hair', 'old', 'age', 'must', 'be', 'stored/utilised/documented', 'photo', 'song', 'poem', 'preserve', 'as', 'long', 'possible.I', 'hasten', 'add', 'should', 'aim', 'high', 'goal-wise', 'can', 'live', 'out', 'dreams', 'Hawke', 'called', 'Delpy', ""'angry"", 'manic', 'depressive', 'activist', 'limo', 'something', 'unstable', 'nature', 'could', 'relate', 'not', 'former', 'opening', 'paragraph', 'statement', 'Hell', 'even', 'Hawke', 'anecdote', 'ferry', 'amazing', 'France', 'great', 'cinematography', 'one', 'German', 'soldier', 'not', 'destroying', 'beautiful', 'monuments/buildings', 'Paris', 'WWII', 'unpressed', 'explosive', 'trigger', 'made', 'history', 'sound', 'so', 'poetic', 'graceful', 'when', 'normally', 'science', 'would', 'look', 'skepticsm', 'cause', 'society', 'ills', 'today']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)

851221,A1LVZOK9F7K4CN,B0002YLC24,JR Pinto,"[1, 6]","Remember in the film Waking Life, when we see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy together?  I figured that the couple from Before Sunrise ended up together.Not so.It is nine years later and the Ethan Hawke character has written a book about his one-night love affair.  He is doing a signing at Shakespeare & Co. in Paris when he finally meets Julie Delpy again.  This movie is very much in the same spirit as the other one: these two characters talk and talk and talk.  The gimmick of this film is that it takes place in ""real time"": Ethan Hawke has about an hour-and-a-half to kill before his plane takes off and we spend every second with those two characters.  (Thank goodness neither of them had to go to the bathroom.)  In that time, we find out why they didn't get together and how their lives are turning out.  The surprising thing is how unattractive Ethan Hawke has turned out - he is now gaunt with bad teeth (perhaps Uma put a curse on him).This film is a little less good than its predecessor.  In Before Sunrise there was more at stake: this couple was meeting each other for the first time, the spent the whole day together, there was more of a sense of possibility.

851222,A3NVNNLSVEVZ99,B0002YLC24,just Jack,"[2, 2]","A remarkable captivating, excellent scripted and sensitively acted film.Before Sunset is simple story on the surface. We all at times wonder 'what if?' about a former relationship that did not end in closure. Nine years on, both lovers have progressed in their lives and into different relationships. But they are captivate by each other in an unexpected meeting. This film lives out that wonder and answers so many of the questions we would have if we ever had that opportunity and the maturity to face an unfinished love.For such a simple and central plot it is remarkable that the film has subtle sub-plots. Pay careful attention to the opening. It sets the scene and raises questions, not only about the plot but also about the structure used to tell the story. Listen to the music and appreciate its significance as part of the story. A very skillful and intelligent film.The film is all the more delightful by the obvious personal collaboration between three people who together wrote, acted and directed the film. Each personally grew through the process as many are privileged to do in making real art. For that reason the film comes across as real life with real but not excessive emotions portrayed by endearing and enduring characters.Before Sunset shows when and how to make a sequel. It builds on the original. It is a film to watch again and again for what it helps us to understand about our lives may never have the opportunity to put into words let alone live out.After you have watched 'Before sunset', you will be wondering about the next 'episode'. The plot will again be predictable because that's life, but told by these skilled storytellers you will want to watch it and find out.just Jack",5,When its right to make a sequel,1168128000,"01 7, 2007",2007,1712,"['remarkable', 'captivating', 'excellent', 'scripted', 'sensitively', 'acted', 'film.Before', 'Sunset', 'simple', 'story', 'surface', 'times', 'wonder', 'former', 'relationship', 'did', 'not', 'end', 'closure', 'Nine', 'years', 'lovers', 'have', 'progressed', 'lives', 'different', 'relationships', 'are', 'captivate', 'other', 'unexpected', 'meeting', 'film', 'out', 'wonder', 'answers', 'so', 'many', 'questions', 'would', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'opportunity', 'maturity', 'face', 'unfinished', 'love.For', 'simple', 'central', 'plot', 'remarkable', 'film', 'subtle', 'sub-plots', 'Pay', 'careful', 'attention', 'opening', 'scene', 'questions', 'not', 'only', 'plot', 'also', 'structure', 'used', 'tell', 'story', 'Listen', 'music', 'appreciate', 'significance', 'part', 'story', 'very', 'skillful', 'intelligent', 'film.The', 'film', 'more', 'delightful', 'obvious', 'personal', 'collaboration', 'three', 'people', 'who', 'together', 'wrote', 'acted', 'directed', 'film', 'personally', 'grew', 'process', 'many', 'are', 'privileged', 'do', 'making', 'real', 'art', 'reason', 'film', 'real', 'life', 'real', 'not', 'excessive', 'emotions', 'portrayed', 'endearing', 'enduring', 'characters.Before', 'Sunset', 'when', 'how', 'make', 'sequel', 'original', 'film', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'what', 'understand', 'lives', 'may', 'never', 'have', 'opportunity', 'put', 'words', 'let', 'alone', 'live', 'out.After', 'have', 'watched', ""'Before"", 'sunset', 'will', 'be', 'wondering', 'next', ""'episode"", 'plot', 'will', 'again', 'be', 'predictable', 'life', 'told', 'skilled', 'storytellers', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'find', 'out.just', 'Jack']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)

851227,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0002YLC24,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[20, 23]","Almost a decade later two adrift souls reconnect after a literature soir&eacute;e at one of Paris' infamous bookshops where cats and coffee belong to the mystique.  These two individuals are Celine (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) who now are wiser and simpler while their lives have actually become more complex.  Despite the complications in their lives, their reunion awakens old emotions from a day in Vienna some nine years ago when they toured the city and each other.  This time they only have a mere 60 minutes, as Jesse has to fly back to the United States like he did 9 years ago.  With no time to lose they begin to converse, as no time has passed since last.  Yet, both feel the pressure of time constraints, as they feel time breathing down their neck. This anxiety is caused by the ticking of time while they know that can only say so much, and they must wisely choose what to say.Interestingly the story brings the audience through a short verbal venture that recaps what has happened to them during the time between now and when they were supposed to have met in Vienna after their first encounter.  Through their personal narrations of what they have been up to, feelings and personal thoughts seep through the walls of tension that they both try to keep up in order to protect themselves and their presence.  As the minutes evaporate, personal concerns filter through cerebral stress and anxiety that rests on a limited foundation of expiring time.  An emotional distillation of verbal expression concentrates on what is important, yet they repress any emotional outburst, as they lean on their social and personal values.  This becomes a balancing act between fear and desire, as they both care for one another they do not want to offend the other, yet they desire to tell what is eating them inside.Delpy and Hawke perform in a brilliant manner, as they depict a delicate balancing act between what they desire and fear of loosing - each other.  The director Richard Linklater depicts the meeting with intense verbal outlet and touching delicacy where the honesty of words are covered in a jumble of emotion that confuses and bewilders both.  This is where the true brilliance of the film rests, as Linklater captures the essence of the reunion.  They desire each other, yet cannot say, as fear of possible pain that could visit them again if sudden erotic feelings were expressed.  Visualized pauses and awkward silence illustrates the duality of the moment where genuine emotion and logic crashes into the wall of apprehensive tension.  Nonetheless, random moments of Freudian feelings pop up without warning, which lightens up the mood between Celine and Jesse.  These moments depict the subconscious ability to surprise where repressed honest feelings infiltrate the anxious consciousness.Throughout the film Celine and Jesse seem to be on the move while knowing of the near impending separation.  This constant movement provides a visual unrest that enhances the lovelorn anxiety within the story, which also transfers genuine empathy for the characters.  Cleverly, Linklater captures the unrest, as they walk, travel by car and boat, and feel that they must gain as much as possible from their limited time together.  Simultaneously, there is an internal struggle within one of them, which seems to want to depart in fear of experiencing the same pain again.  Yet, they hold onto the moment while learning more about each other's pain and suffering.There is a continuous level of serenity within the story that Linklater captures by filming the story of a summer evening in the Paris sun.  The friendly atmosphere between Celine and Jesse combined with the easy flow of the camera from location to location without any sudden movement helps to induce this tranquility.  The calmness within the story suggests that there is something special going on between Celine and Jesse, but maybe it is too late, as they already have their lives in Paris and New York.  Nonetheless, the unbroken serenity provides a notion of something special, yet it also seems as if this calmness stirs up strong emotional currents from the past, which could be very hurtful.  The story does not provide any climatic moments.  It merely continues, as the clock keep ticking pressuring them about the expiring time.Before Sunset is a wonderful film about moments and opportunities in the light of signs and symbols that offer a chance to see the truth--the truth of what one wishes and desires while time rapidly warns that there is no time to loose.  An inner voice whispers, carpe diem, while logic tells one to ponder the long term effects.  This occurs while wisdom offers a middle path where one should follow one's own heart without listening to fear, or temporary pleasure.  All of this is shrewdly tailored in a cinematic experience that takes brilliant consideration to script, cinematography, performances, and mise-en-scene, which in the end presents truly great cinematic experience.",5,Brilliant Linklater Elevates the Cinematic Experience...,1114300800,"04 24, 2005",2005,5000,"['Almost', 'decade', 'later', 'two', 'adrift', 'souls', 'reconnect', 'literature', 'soir', 'eacute', 'one', 'Paris', 'infamous', 'bookshops', 'where', 'cats', 'coffee', 'belong', 'mystique', 'two', 'individuals', 'are', 'Celine', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'Jesse', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'who', 'now', 'are', 'wiser', 'simpler', 'lives', 'have', 'actually', 'become', 'more', 'complex', 'complications', 'lives', 'reunion', 'old', 'emotions', 'day', 'Vienna', 'nine', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'toured', 'city', 'other', 'time', 'only', 'have', 'mere', '60', 'minutes', 'Jesse', 'fly', 'back', 'United', 'States', 'did', '9', 'years', 'ago', 'time', 'lose', 'begin', 'converse', 'time', 'passed', 'last', 'feel', 'pressure', 'time', 'constraints', 'feel', 'time', 'breathing', 'down', 'neck', 'anxiety', 'caused', 'ticking', 'time', 'know', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'so', 'much', 'must', 'wisely', 'choose', 'what', 'say.Interestingly', 'story', 'audience', 'short', 'verbal', 'venture', 'what', 'happened', 'time', 'now', 'when', 'were', 'supposed', 'have', 'met', 'Vienna', 'first', 'encounter', 'personal', 'narrations', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'up', 'feelings', 'personal', 'thoughts', 'seep', 'walls', 'tension', 'try', 'keep', 'up', 'order', 'protect', 'presence', 'minutes', 'evaporate', 'personal', 'concerns', 'filter', 'cerebral', 'stress', 'anxiety', 'limited', 'foundation', 'expiring', 'time', 'emotional', 'distillation', 'verbal', 'expression', 'concentrates', 'what', 'important', 'yet', 'repress', 'emotional', 'outburst', 'lean', 'social', 'personal', 'values', 'balancing', 'act', 'fear', 'desire', 'care', 'one', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'offend', 'other', 'yet', 'desire', 'tell', 'what', 'eating', 'inside.Delpy', 'Hawke', 'perform', 'brilliant', 'manner', 'depict', 'delicate', 'balancing', 'act', 'what', 'desire', 'fear', 'loosing', 'other', 'director', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'meeting', 'intense', 'verbal', 'outlet', 'touching', 'delicacy', 'where', 'honesty', 'words', 'are', 'covered', 'jumble', 'emotion', 'confuses', 'bewilders', 'where', 'true', 'brilliance', 'film', 'rests', 'Linklater', 'essence', 'reunion', 'desire', 'other', 'yet', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'fear', 'possible', 'pain', 'could', 'visit', 'again', 'sudden', 'erotic', 'feelings', 'were', 'expressed', 'Visualized', 'pauses', 'awkward', 'silence', 'duality', 'moment', 'where', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'logic', 'crashes', 'wall', 'apprehensive', 'tension', 'Nonetheless', 'random', 'moments', 'Freudian', 'feelings', 'pop', 'up', 'warning', 'up', 'mood', 'Celine', 'Jesse', 'moments', 'depict', 'subconscious', 'ability', 'surprise', 'where', 'repressed', 'honest', 'feelings', 'infiltrate', 'anxious', 'consciousness.Throughout', 'film', 'Celine', 'Jesse', 'seem', 'be', 'move', 'knowing', 'near', 'impending', 'separation', 'constant', 'movement', 'visual', 'unrest', 'lovelorn', 'anxiety', 'story', 'also', 'genuine', 'empathy', 'characters', 'Cleverly', 'Linklater', 'unrest', 'walk', 'travel', 'car', 'boat', 'feel', 'must', 'gain', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'limited', 'time', 'together', 'Simultaneously', 'internal', 'struggle', 'one', 'want', 'depart', 'fear', 'experiencing', 'same', 'pain', 'again', 'hold', 'moment', 'learning', 'more', 'other', 'pain', 'suffering.There', 'continuous', 'level', 'serenity', 'story', 'Linklater', 'captures', 'filming', 'story', 'summer', 'evening', 'Paris', 'sun', 'friendly', 'atmosphere', 'Celine', 'Jesse', 'combined', 'easy', 'flow', 'camera', 'location', 'location', 'sudden', 'movement', 'induce', 'tranquility', 'calmness', 'story', 'something', 'special', 'going', 'Celine', 'Jesse', 'maybe', 'too', 'late', 'already', 'have', 'lives', 'Paris', 'New', 'York', 'Nonetheless', 'unbroken', 'serenity', 'notion', 'something', 'special', 'also', 'calmness', 'up', 'strong', 'emotional', 'currents', 'past', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'hurtful', 'story', 'not', 'provide', 'climatic', 'moments', 'merely', 'clock', 'keep', 'ticking', 'pressuring', 'expiring', 'time.Before', 'Sunset', 'wonderful', 'film', 'moments', 'opportunities', 'light', 'signs', 'symbols', 'offer', 'chance', 'see', 'truth', 'truth', 'what', 'one', 'wishes', 'desires', 'time', 'rapidly', 'time', 'loose', 'inner', 'voice', 'whispers', 'carpe', 'diem', 'logic', 'tells', 'one', 'ponder', 'long', 'term', 'effects', 'wisdom', 'middle', 'path', 'where', 'one', 'should', 'follow', 'one', 'own', 'heart', 'listening', 'fear', 'temporary', 'pleasure', 'shrewdly', 'tailored', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'brilliant', 'consideration', 'script', 'cinematography', 'performances', 'mise-en-scene', 'end', 'truly', 'great', 'cinematic', 'experience']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)

851232,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0002YLC24,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[13, 17]","What ever happened to Jesse and Celine after they walked and talked the night away in Vienna in ""Before Sunrise""?  Apparently that question preoccupied not only director Richard Linklater and his co-writer Kim Krizan, but Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, who played Jesse and Celine, as well, because all four of them worked on the script for ""Before Sunset.""  It is nine years later and although Jesse and Celine promised to meet again in Vienna six months later, they did not.  But Jesse has written a best-selling novel about the night he spent with Celine and on the final stop of a European tour promoting the book he turns around and discovers her standing there.  Of course, they have to talk, and while they have a lot to say to each other the catch is that he has a flight back to America that night.  This time their conversation has to be over before the sun sets.""Before Sunset"" is not just the counterpart to ""Before Sunrise"" because it represents the day the way the original represents the night.  In 1995 these two were young, on the threshold of life where all things are possible.  Now, in the light of day, they can look at both their past and their present, as if there was not a nine-year gap in the conversation.  Again we are treated to lengthy takes where the camera shows Jesse and Celine talking, talking while walking, talking while in the back of a taxi, talking while sitting, but talking all the time.  Again we find ourselves wondering if there really is a script or if Hawke and Delpy are just making it up as they go along.The conversation gets around to the big questions (who did or did not show up six months later and who is or is not married with kids) but as easy as it is to talk it takes a while to get the nerve to be able to hear the answers, especially since that leads to the elephant in the room: did they make a big mistake by not ending up together?  ""Memories is a good thing if you don't have to deal with the past,"" she says at a particularly insightful moment, but Jesse and Celine have to deal with both.There is a moment early in the film, when Jesse is being interviewed about his book, whether he correctly characterizes his audience as being divided into three parts regarding the ambiguous ending of his novel, which apparently ends just like the first movie.  There are those convinced the young couple got back together, those who know they never say each other again, and those unable to make a choice.  But because ""Before Sunrise"" was such an intimate film, ""Before Sunset"" is not burdened by the overwhelming expectations faced by Alexandra Ripley when she wrote ""Scarlett,"" the sequel to ""Gone With the Wind,"" that had to find a convincing way of getting Rhett and Scarlett back together on another day.  Fortunately, Jesse and Celine are life size, which is why their story has captivated so many of those who managed to actually see ""Before Sunrise.""""Before Sunset"" is different from most other sequels because it was not made to capitalize on the financial success of the original.  ""Before Sunrise"" made $5,535,405 in the U.S. ($22,600,000 worldwide), which is probably what ""The Incredibles"" made before sunset last Friday when it opened.  ""Before Sunset,"" which cost four times as much to make, made $5,792,822 in the U.S.  But the writers/actors obviously cared about the characters as much as the viewers who captivated those who say the original film.

First and foremost, there were far too many loose ends about Celine and Jesse that were left unanswered in ""Before Sunrise"": (1) Did they consummate their love in the park? (2) Did they both NOT show up six months after their first encounter in Vienna as it would have been totally disastrous for the one who did and why?After a slow start to ""Before Sunset"", Jesse and Celine instanteously struck up a chord and reconnected right there and then from where they left of some 9 years ago. Not one iota of the wonderful chemistry they once shared was lost.  The only difference - now that they were older, they were perhaps more reserved about opening up but all this were but a facade cos when they finally bore they hearts out explaining how they both took the turn for the worse in life, it was a truly cathartic experience (my favorite was their emotionally-charged dialogue exchanged at the backseat of the cab). Julie Delphy has proven herself to be more than just a pretty face but a talented/eloquent actress/scriptwriter, not least a sexy crooner (more from the final credits).In all, the movie ended on the only logical, albeit a deliberately ""ambiguous"" note....but, as viewers, we are already all too joyous to know that the fictional couple did meet again and are hopeful that - after all they'd been through in their 9 years of separation - they would appreciate each other to the fullest and deservedly live happily ever after.Awaiting impatiently for the third of the ""Before S"" trilogy...",5,"Better than ""Before Sunrise""",1097884800,"10 16, 2004",2004,1611,"['Been', 'waiting', 'Linklater', 'produce', 'sequel', 'ever', 'Waking', 'Life', 'was', 'filmed', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'First', 'foremost', 'were', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'Celine', 'Jesse', 'were', 'left', 'unanswered', 'Sunrise', '1', 'Did', 'consummate', 'love', 'park', '2', 'Did', 'NOT', 'show', 'up', 'six', 'months', 'first', 'encounter', 'Vienna', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'totally', 'disastrous', 'one', 'who', 'did', 'why', 'slow', 'start', 'Sunset', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'instanteously', 'struck', 'up', 'chord', 'reconnected', 'right', 'there', 'then', 'where', 'left', '9', 'years', 'ago', 'Not', 'one', 'iota', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'once', 'shared', 'was', 'lost', 'only', 'difference', 'now', 'were', 'older', 'were', 'perhaps', 'more', 'reserved', 'opening', 'up', 'were', 'facade', 'cos', 'when', 'finally', 'bore', 'hearts', 'out', 'explaining', 'how', 'took', 'turn', 'worse', 'life', 'was', 'truly', 'cathartic', 'experience', 'favorite', 'was', 'emotionally-charged', 'dialogue', 'exchanged', 'backseat', 'cab', 'Julie', 'Delphy', 'proven', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'talented/eloquent', 'actress/scriptwriter', 'not', 'least', 'sexy', 'crooner', 'more', 'final', 'credits', '.In', 'movie', 'ended', 'only', 'logical', 'deliberately', 'ambiguous', 'note', '.but', 'viewers', 'are', 'already', 'all', 'too', 'joyous', 'know', 'fictional', 'couple', 'did', 'meet', 'again', 'are', 'hopeful', ""'d"", 'been', '9', 'years', 'separation', 'would', 'appreciate', 'other', 'fullest', 'deservedly', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.Awaiting', 'impatiently', 'third', 'S', 'trilogy']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)

Ethan Hawke stammers so many times you wonder if he cracked his head getting off the Metro and addled his brains.  Julie Delpy is so old looking, worn out and haggerdy.  Her character's frequent soapboxing is tired too.I don't see much between these characters.  Clearly Julie Delpy's character is deeper, more introspective.  She challenge's Ethan Hawke's character several times, and all he can do is stammer and leer.Ethan is married, yet he is obviously more than ready to fling his committments aside and make a little French Connection (pardon the pun).  This is disturbing.  I mean, it is not like these two characters had some sort of deep or long lasting relationship.  They met briefly, talked, flirted, and drifted apart.  Now, ten years later, he is willing to throw aside his responsibilities for her.The movie is mostly about talk.  Talk, talk, talk.  Mostly Julie Delpy's character blathering on and on and on and on about life and wicked imperialistic nations like....America.WARNING TO AMERICANS:  If a single patriotic cell exists inside your body, you may not want to rent, watch, or buy this movie.  Before Sunset is just another attempt by the left-wing, America-hating Movie Industry to stir up anti-American sentiments.  In this pathetically lousy flick, they cast the United States of America in the role of BIG BAD OPRESSOR, Land of Rape and Murder (watch for Julie Delpy's character's little ""boo-hoo, sniff-sniff"" speech early in the film about how she, the poor little sheltered French girl trembled with fear during a visit to America (where people are raped and abused by the police).  Her little diatribe about how an American policeman waved a gun about and basically threatened her was ridiculous and nauseating.The film makes it look like Paris is a haven, a cosmopositan but quaint world-class city with no crime, and New York City is a cesspool of murder and rape.  Interesting, considering the following statistics found on the International Crime Statistics Comparison website:Here are Interpol 2001 crime statistics (rate per 100,000):4161 - US7736 - Germany6941 - France9927 - England and WalesThus the US has a substantially lower crime rate than the major European countries!Here are the Interpol 1995 crime statistics (rate per 100,000):5278 - US8179 - Germany6316 - France7206 - England & WalesBesides the clearly WE HATE AMERICA, THE BIG BAD OPRESSIVE IMPERIALISTIC NATION message, the film just. . . sucks Seine water.I am a bonafide Francophile and adore France, but I am also a patrotic American.

851235,A3485K2A3Q814Z,B0002YLC24,Lemons,"[0, 1]","I really loved Before Sunrise, the first in this trilogy. I could relate with Celine and Jessie's immediate connection, possibly because I had a similar experience a long time ago. There was spontaneity, chemistry, friendship and honesty, all in the lovely setting of Vienna.Nine years later Jessie is in Paris to promote his book about . . . his one day/night with Celine. As he is finishing up, he notices Celine standing to one side in the bookstore. He has twenty minutes before having to leave for the airport, but they go for coffee anyway.OK, we all know that Jessie will run into Celine and they will walk around another beautiful city, Paris this time, talking and talking, yada yada. And we all know how it will finish too. The movie did not have a point, other than to promise . . . another sequel.The idea of making three movies over eighteen years is, in principle, great. The actors are genuinely older, not pretending to be. Both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy were involved in writing the script for this one. I haven't seen Before Midnight yet, but I know where it is headed.Mid-way, I was starting to get the same sense of boredom that is experienced at a get together when one doesn't know anyone, or when in conversation with &#34;enough about me, let's talk about me&#34; individuals. Here we are subjected to two self absorbed people catching up on 9 years of angst. Their friendship is apparent, but as the movie develops, what little scrap of their original chemistry that they are trying to convey evaporates, particularly from Delpy's side.The constant reference to Jessie being late for his plane was so irritating that I kept looking at my watch. After all, how could they stretch twenty minutes into one hour and twenty minutes. Towards the end, it felt more fitting just to say : &#34;Great seeing you, have a wonderful life&#34;.

With a refreshing  honesty I have yet to see an ANY movie, the characters make you believe that you are being allowed to follow them for a few hours, glimpsing more into their souls than just their conversations. I love the whole concept of seeing their relationship in 'real time', (over the span of 18 years-including the next sequel ""Before Midnight"" due out on DVD Aug. or Sept.). We not only see the changes in their physical appearances after 9 years, but also how their beliefs and expectations of youth have changed, or in some instances remained the same.. It's fascinating  and made even more so when you know that much of the dialogue was adlibbed by Hawke and Delpy. This explains the naturalness of their conversations.

851238,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B0002YLC24,Lleu Christopher,"[6, 7]","Richard Linklater's films contain some of the best dialogue I've ever heard on screen (e.g. Dazed and Confused, Waking Life), and this is one of his best. Unlike most sequels, this one is actually as good as the original, Before Sunrise, which is an accomplishment in itself. Both of these films capture an intense connection between two people that is romantic, intellectual and life-altering. Before Sunrise is about two young people, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), who meet and fall in love aboard a train in Europe. After spending one very intense day together, they part and promise to meet later in Vienna. That film ends with the future of their relationship left uncertain. Now, nine years later, Before Sunset brings them back together. Jesse has written a book based on their encounter, and Celine shows up at his book signing in Paris. They walk around the city and discuss everything from politics to religion to their love lives.In most romantic movies, the dialogue consists of clever or funny words that the characters use to seduce each other and the audience. In this film, however, like its predecessor, these people actually have ideas about life, society and other things that stray beyond the scope of most popular entertainment. This will make the film tedious to some. Yet Before Sunset rises above the limits of some dialogue-centered films, which often come across as stage plays. The variety of issues that Jesse and Celine discuss, the way their moods shift, and the scenic background provided by the city combine to create a depth that prevents the film from being simply ""talky.""  More importantly, the actors do a superb job in building emotional tension as the conversation slips gradually from general topics into the characters' intense feelings for each another, which they are at first reluctant to reveal. Before Sunset has a focus that is very specific regarding two people but also very insightful about universal concerns. Both Hawke and Delpy give  extremely natural performances; they, along with Linklater, are credited with writing the screenplay, which I suspect was partly improvised.  I especially liked the ending, which is both perfect and avoids being a cliche, no small feat in a romance.",5,Romantic sequel reunites lovers,1101081600,"11 22, 2004",2004,2253,"['Richard', 'Linklater', 'films', 'contain', 'best', 'dialogue', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'screen', 'e.g', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'Waking', 'Life', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'sequels', 'one', 'actually', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'Sunrise', 'accomplishment', 'films', 'capture', 'intense', 'connection', 'two', 'people', 'romantic', 'intellectual', 'life-altering', 'Sunrise', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'Jesse', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Celine', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'who', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'train', 'Europe', 'spending', 'one', 'very', 'intense', 'day', 'together', 'part', 'promise', 'meet', 'later', 'Vienna', 'film', 'future', 'relationship', 'left', 'uncertain', 'Now', 'nine', 'years', 'later', 'Sunset', 'back', 'together', 'Jesse', 'written', 'book', 'based', 'encounter', 'Celine', 'up', 'book', 'signing', 'Paris', 'walk', 'city', 'discuss', 'everything', 'politics', 'religion', 'love', 'most', 'romantic', 'movies', 'dialogue', 'clever', 'funny', 'words', 'characters', 'use', 'seduce', 'other', 'audience', 'film', 'however', 'predecessor', 'people', 'actually', 'have', 'ideas', 'life', 'society', 'other', 'things', 'stray', 'scope', 'most', 'popular', 'entertainment', 'will', 'make', 'film', 'tedious', 'Sunset', 'rises', 'limits', 'dialogue-centered', 'films', 'often', 'come', 'stage', 'plays', 'variety', 'issues', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'discuss', 'way', 'moods', 'shift', 'scenic', 'background', 'provided', 'city', 'combine', 'create', 'depth', 'film', 'being', 'simply', 'talky', 'More', 'importantly', 'actors', 'do', 'superb', 'job', 'building', 'emotional', 'tension', 'conversation', 'gradually', 'general', 'topics', 'characters', 'intense', 'feelings', 'are', 'first', 'reluctant', 'reveal', 'Sunset', 'focus', 'very', 'specific', 'regarding', 'two', 'people', 'also', 'very', 'insightful', 'universal', 'concerns', 'Hawke', 'Delpy', 'give', 'extremely', 'natural', 'performances', 'Linklater', 'are', 'credited', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'suspect', 'was', 'partly', 'improvised', 'especially', 'liked', 'ending', 'perfect', 'avoids', 'being', 'cliche', 'small', 'feat', 'romance']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)

I set the DVD to french to minimize the pain, but it was still unbearable to see constant close-ups of their yellowing teeth which were constantly visible with them talking about their terribly boring lives.And Ethan Hawke!

How does anything else after that even compare to that once-in-a-lifetime experience of meeting the one random stranger you connect with instantaneously?  And how do you go on when your ideal of a soulmate turns out to be an illusion that leaves you stranded alone in Vienna?  Does love become an illusion thereafter?I watched Before Sunrise when I was 13 years old and still believed hopelessly in happily ever after.  I was disappointed that there wasn't the final happily ever after for Jessie and Celine but convinced myself that they would ultimately meet again and live as they should.  Well, a lot's changed for both me and the characters in the movie in the past 9 years.  This is the first movie that I felt grew with me...grew more experienced, more cynical, more disappointed, etc.  And I have to say, I loved it even more than the original.  This movie, much like the original, is devoid of anything spectacular.  There are no special effects, no gags guaranteed to make the audience laugh.  It's literally just the two actors who despite life's disappointments find themselves together again for the second and possibly last time.  I use the word ""actors"" because there is such a rawness to the dialogue that it's easy to juxtapose Ethan Hawke for Jessie and Julie Delpy for Celine.  The disappointment each character talks about is as familiar to me now as the hopeless romance of Before Sunrise was to the 13 year old who watched it 9 years ago.  And yet, despite being older and more realistic, the characters and you, as the viewer, end up wondering ""what if.""  What if Jessie and Celine are really meant to be?  What if fate really does exist?Before Sunrise is the coming of age for both you, the viewer, and for Ethan Hawke.  This is not to slight Julie Delpy, but having grown up with Ethan Hawke in Dead Poets Society and Reality Bites - a truly seminal movie in my teens, you finally really get to see who he's become as an adult.  It was gratifying to see all the flaws and the wrinkles that accompany this accomplished, intelligent person.Before Sunrise makes your realize that even though you may be older, more wizened, more pessimistic about love and life - and rightfully so - when that one person comes back into your life, there is nothing you won't do to be able to spend just one more minute, one more song with that person.  So hey, perhaps we are still that hopeless romantic we were at 13...it's just been dormant for awhile.

I decided to give it a shot after being floored by its first part, shot nine years before, ""Before Sunrise"". Today, I confess my admiration for what director Richard Linklater, along with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy accomplished.Hawke and Delpy meet again during the last stop of his book tour in Europe, when she drops by the bookstore where he's giving a press conference. After that, they have about an hour to catch up where they left things at nine years before, when they said goodbye (at the end of ""Before Sunrise"") in a Vienna train station.This movie is close to perfection in many ways. The dialogs are fascinating: far from conventional, very deep and still romantic in many ways. The timeline (80 minutes) is almost in real-time (having been shot in a little over two weeks, after another two weeks of rehearsal), which makes some scenes admirable from all points of view: some approach the demands of theatrical work. The music, a bit more inconspicuous than in the first one, is still fantastic.Overall, this one, with its 1995 counterpart, are bound to become all-time classics.

Don?t get me wrong, much of the dialogue was sharp, fresh and even profound. But this so-called romantic movie was so hard pressed to reel in the banter, they hardly found time for any romance.Yes, I remember ""Before Sunrise,"" but I don't remember Hawke and Delpi never taking a breath. Never coming up for air. No matter how brave or fascinating the conversation may be, and like I said it was sharp and refreshing most of the time, somewhere, sometime they have to shut up and kiss each other, or something!The premise was fantastic. And romantic. Assuming the viewer saw and enjoyed ?Before Sunrise,? ?Before Sunset? should have picked up where their broken hearts left off. And much more. Unfortunately, the much more was not to be.Even early on, when Ethan Hawke spots Julie Delpy at his book signing event there was virtually no chemistry. Slowly and mysteriously they finally begin to warm up to each other, but not in a mystical magical romantic sort of way. Some would argue that was the whole point of this movie. But did they need to walk and talk and walk and talk and walk and talk their way through the whole entire encounter to reveal just how sharp-tongued and intellectual they had become?Happily, there were a lot of insightful, reflective and even funny moments during this film. But I would be quick to point out that this is NOT supposed to be the sort of film that becomes so cerebral it has no room for its heart and soul. Unfortunately, that's the way it came off to me. Especially, the highly unsatisfying ending!This movie, undoubtedly will appeal to the more 'neurotic' romantic than the mainstream. And usually for me that's a good thing. Perhaps if they didn't cut the movie off so abruptly and ended with a passionate finale I could have forgiven the verbal barage.More for the 'S&M;' crowd.

'Before Sunset' is one very notable exception. We rejoin Jesse and Celine this time in Paris for a look at ""what might've been"" nine years after their blazing day/night in Vienna. The movie is one long dialogue-filled catching up session walking through the streets of Paris, in a bookstore, a cafe, on a boat and finally in her apartment. The interaction between them is filled with deep philosophical reflections on love, death, life, unhappiness and just about everything important in between.The theme here shows that the writer/director has more than a passing fancy with 'Ulysses' by James Joyce. In fact, in the first movie, their meeting takes place on 'Bloomsday' June 16th which is the day chronicled in Joyce's massive novel. In the second movie, 'Shakespeare and Company' bookstore where 'Ulysses' was first published features prominently in the story because Jesse is talking about his own book which it just so happens chronicles a single important day in his life.... This little art imitating life and then reimitating art is a clever touch.The acting by both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is intelligent, intense and most of all incredibly real! You feel like you know these characters as friends by the end of 'Before Sunset.' The ending is wisely kept open to the viewer's own interpretation of events.

851250,AESY8NCX6VS6O,B0002YLC24,M. Burns,"[6, 7]","The romantics have fought the realists for God-knows-how-many years. Does love triumph above all things or do we, in the immortal words of Ms. Krabappel, &quot;marry out of fear of dying alone?&quot; Well, Before Sunset (the - for some - long-awaited follow-up to Before Sunrise) has arrived, and it's enough to make both camps shut up for a while. Here is a movie so intensely romantic yet so heartbreakingly pragmatic, I went from smiling to sadness and back without missing a beat. And let me get this out of the way before I get really rolling: Before Sunset is better than Sunrise, and it's a flipping masterpiece.If you've done your duty as a young cinephile, you've seen 1994's Before Sunrise, in which two strangers, Jessie (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), spend a spontaneous sumer night in Vienna but part in the morning (hence the title) sans exchanging info. Sunrise was a slight, sweet little indie flick where fledgling philosophers debated love, sex, and life and created an unforgettable memory. Sunset picks up nine years later with Jesse in Paris on a book tour for, ironically, a fictionalized account of his own 'fling.' And, well, duh! - he runs into Celine and they decide to catch up before his impending doom...err, plane flight.And yet I make this sound too easy. I expected Sunset to be simply a stylistic continuation of its predecessor (like most sequels), but SUnset is very much a different movie, even if we do listen to two people chatting for the duration. First of all, Sunset reacts to the events of nine years ago, not just continuing them. Jessie and Celine both created a turning point of lost love then, and before our eyes it comes rushing back. The question is not, like the last one, 'will they do it?' - but = how in the hell will they cope with this? Nearly a decade ago, both were in a place where picking up and starting anew was a fiercely real possibility. On the way to 40, it's not so easy, and their dialogue (masterfully devoid of the slightest pretention) radiates that tension.And what about Hawke and Delpy? Both look older and skinnier (that how-am-I-different? discussion provides one of the film's many big laughs), but seem wiser and maybe more neurotic as they navigate the gorgeous paths of Paris. It's somewhat hard to imagine Jesse got married and had a kid in those years, but it's probably because we prefer the idea of him with Celine. We're glad to see her single, but i'ts clear that it hints at her deeper quirks. Director Linklater's leisurely paced journey isn't afraid to let us get frustrated with either character, or even disagree, as well (a scene in the backseat of a cab late in the film is so risky and raw it could be labeled as off-putting, but I loved how it landed safely after all). In short, Sunset is a much more deeply felt, living-and-breathing organism than its predecessor.But it doesn't stray too far - the ongoing conversation is still as insightful and funny as Before Sunrise, and they still bring up intriguing notions about the real, philosophical, and sexual worlds. I especially loved an early moment when a secret about their proposed 6-months-later meeting was revealed. Hawke and Delpy project the care, guilt, shame, and nostalgia that such a situation would have and seem to segue to new convos in a blissfully seamless fashion, that the film's dive into Bergman-esque territory near the end (the loveless marriage) feels natural. And we stay with them even then, because by this time we love these characters to the point where it doesn't feel like voyeurism, and that's quite and accomplishment......Then again, so is the whole movie, right up to it's brilliantly ambiguous finale that had me clapping for the first time in a long time (Do me a favor and bring back the clap when a movie deserves it).I simply can't say enough about this movie, or Linklater, or Hawke or Delpy, who co-wrote the script with him. The great films make us want to follow the characters off the screen and into their lives; Sunset is that rare breed of movie that does that for us, and it makes for a deliriously beautiful 80 minutes.

I was taken in by the title, and the blurb. That's it. It sounded like a really romantic film, one that I might identify with, as I've always wondered what would happen if I met my first love again, if I would have the same feelings. After watching the very, very long trailer, I was slightly disappointed, and I only managed to half an hour into the film, before I started to doze off. It's so incredibly boring! And although I wouldn't say I normally mind ""real time"" films, it's all set in the mid-late afternoon, a very dull time of day if you ask me. It was the only time of day director Richard Linklater would shoot the scenes in the film. He felt it added to the reality of the film, and often relied on the actors to get perfect takes at the right time, and it shows, as it was shot in a mere 15 days.But it's nothing but talk and meandering around Parisian streets in the parts I watched. I just didn't identify with it. Nothing happened. And I hated the two actors.

It's a simple, sad story told with a refreshingly unique and seamless style.It's really an amazing, different movie. I was impressed, I mean it's basically an 80 minute conversation, but you get so engrossed in it you don't notice. It moves so fluidly and naturally it's literally like reconnecting with old friends and spending a few hours with them. Achieving this, the filmmakers don't need anything else but words and actors to bring them to life. A little aside, I love how they'll use the long takes but then cut briefly to a closeup or another shot to keep any unnecessary tension away from the experience.The acting is completely natural, often disarmingly and remarkably so, there is nothing to suggest that they are acting as they are so lifelike and realistic. These characters are incredibly real and deep and hurt, but it's not heavy-handed or overt in any aspect. The presence of a fate and destiny thwarted haunts us and them. Julie Delpy is delightful, but I think it is Ethan Hawke who is really transcendent in this. I loved his performance immensely.This is a bittersweet nearly heartbreaking film, but not really that depressing as it's not in the least heavy or dark. It's just beautifully done all around and is often a heck of a lot of fun to watch.

The two twenty-somethings, one American and one French, who spent an entire night wandering around Vienna in the mid-'90s, and slowly falling almost-in-love, have run into each other again in Paris. Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is now a published novelist, his book being a fictional account of that amazing night a decade before. Celine (Julia Delpy) seeks him out at a book signing and the two have a few hours to catch up with each other before Jesse has to catch a plane back to his wife and son in New York. You really have to have seen Before Sunrise to understand much of their conversation -- which they pick up almost as if they had never stopped -- but the dialogue is extremely human and therefore very affecting. Is Jesse happy with his life? He says so, at first -- but maybe not, given the subject of his novel. And why has Celine never found a permanent relationship? And did either of them keep their six-months-later appointment in Vienna? As before, the city itself -- Paris, this time -- is the third major character in the story.

Therefore, I was overjoyed to see that in the sequel, ""Before Sunset,"" Linklater provides an answer that is not only satisfying, but actually improves on the original. The new film is set nine years later in Paris, where Celine (Julie Delpy)  attends Jesse's (Ethan Hawke) book-signing for his novel based on that fateful night in Vienna. (Note: the years have been much kinder to Delpy than to Hawke; she looks gorgeous, he looks haggard.) With scarcely a beat, they resume their long-interrupted conversation about love and life, filling each other in about what they've been doing since they saw each other last. Set in real time as Celine and Jesse take a  walk through Paris, the conversation (improvised by Hawke and Delpy on a framework provided by Linklater) builds quietly to overwhelming rushes of emotion, and ends on an ambiguous note that some viewers might find unsatisfying but I found abundantly believable and hopeful. Linklater, Hawke and Delpy keep the movie flowing gracefully, and Lee Daniel's glowing photography of Paris provides the perfect touch for a movie that appeals to the romantic in us all.",5,"""Brief Encounter"" meets ""My Dinner with Andre.""",1089417600,"07 10, 2004",2004,1420,"['other', 'fan', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'Sunrise', 'indulged', 'great', 'deal', 'pleasurable', 'speculation', 'Celine', 'Jesse', 'actually', 'reunited', 'Vienna', 'six', 'months', 'day', 'meeting', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'anxious', 'Linklater', 'answer', 'question', 'definitively', 'Therefore', 'was', 'overjoyed', 'see', 'sequel', 'Sunset', 'Linklater', 'answer', 'not', 'only', 'satisfying', 'actually', 'original', 'new', 'film', 'set', 'nine', 'years', 'later', 'Paris', 'where', 'Celine', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'Jesse', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'book-signing', 'novel', 'based', 'fateful', 'night', 'Vienna', 'Note', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'kinder', 'Delpy', 'Hawke', 'gorgeous', 'haggard', 'scarcely', 'beat', 'resume', 'long-interrupted', 'conversation', 'love', 'life', 'filling', 'other', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'saw', 'other', 'last', 'Set', 'real', 'time', 'Celine', 'Jesse', 'take', 'walk', 'Paris', 'conversation', 'improvised', 'Hawke', 'Delpy', 'framework', 'provided', 'Linklater', 'quietly', 'overwhelming', 'rushes', 'emotion', 'ambiguous', 'note', 'viewers', 'might', 'find', 'unsatisfying', 'found', 'abundantly', 'believable', 'hopeful', 'Linklater', 'Hawke', 'Delpy', 'keep', 'movie', 'flowing', 'gracefully', 'Lee', 'Daniel', 'glowing', 'photography', 'Paris', 'perfect', 'touch', 'movie', 'appeals', 'romantic']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)

851259,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B0002YLC24,Muzzlehatch,"[4, 4]","Paris, 2003. Jesse, an American writer in his early 30s, is signing books and giving a talk at Shakespeare & Company, the famed Parisian bookseller that first printed ""Ulysses"" in 1922. The book chronicles a one-night stand nearly a decade earlier that he just can't get out of his mind. As he is about to finish, he locks eyes for a moment on a particular face in the stacks: Celine, the woman he met nine years before on a summer night in Vienna. For anyone who has seen and loved BEFORE SUNRISE, the film chronicling that meeting, the moment of recognition in this sequel comes as an all-time great moment in cinema...five minutes in, and I knew I was in the presence of greatness.Celine and Jesse go for a cup of coffee at a caf&eacute;, traversing a half-dozen windy, ancient Parisian streets, and they talk about careers and education, what has led them to this place. Interestingly enough, the dialog was largely scripted by the actors, and they both express (non-acting) interests that mirror the real lives of Hawke (a successful novelist) and Delpy (an environmental activist and musician who has recorded a couple of albums); they also play to their ages and they play characters that are reasonably successful in the outward sense, so a great aura of realism is maintained with little effort. This allows the dialog to ebb and flow, to continue easily for the 80 minute duration of this real-time walk through the streets and gardens of Paris, through life, career, love, lust, politics.And it all may seem very boring to you, if what you expect is ""drama"" and ""event""; if you expect your romances to be full of sex and unbelievable situations and jealousy and hysteria. BEFORE SUNSET is 80 minutes of two very intelligent, articulate people reacquainting themselves with each other, reawakening to youthful aspirations and romantic hopes that they assumed were withering. It's a paean to French ideals and American excesses, to Paris and to music and to architecture and literature, all conveyed in the expressions and words of two hopeless romantics and in the passion their director has for the noble idea, so rarely practiced, of the importance and power of each day, each hour, each minute of life.I'm going on a bit perhaps, but I cannot think of a more ""real"", knowing film about love, about the lost past and the hopeful future than this minimalist tour through the eyes of a brazen Texan and a talkative Parisian. It's easy for me to fall in love with actresses, but Julie Delpy is simply unbelievable here and I've rarely felt more jealous in a movie than I did of Ethan Hawke (who I rarely like, but is as perfect here as he was in the earlier film).There are many wonderful allusions to film history in this hour and a third but the most potent is the short cruise down the Seine near the end, which brings to mind most obviously two of the most romantic and expressionist films in French history, Vigo's L'ATALANTE (1934) and Carax' LES AMANTS DU PONT NEUF (1991). I was wondering if this film would end there, but instead the couple detours to Celine's apartment for the stunning, very appropriate finale.Along with it's predecessor, one of the very greatest films about falling in love - an re-falling - in the history of cinema.",5,Ecstatic,1253836800,"09 25, 2009",2009,3256,"['Paris', '2003', 'Jesse', 'American', 'writer', 'early', '30s', 'signing', 'books', 'giving', 'talk', 'Shakespeare', 'Company', 'famed', 'Parisian', 'bookseller', 'first', 'printed', 'Ulysses', '1922', 'book', 'one-night', 'stand', 'nearly', 'decade', 'earlier', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'mind', 'finish', 'eyes', 'moment', 'particular', 'face', 'stacks', 'Celine', 'woman', 'met', 'nine', 'years', 'summer', 'night', 'Vienna', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'loved', 'BEFORE', 'SUNRISE', 'film', 'chronicling', 'meeting', 'moment', 'recognition', 'sequel', 'all-time', 'great', 'moment', 'cinema', 'five', 'minutes', 'knew', 'was', 'presence', 'greatness.Celine', 'Jesse', 'go', 'cup', 'coffee', 'caf', 'eacute', 'traversing', 'half-dozen', 'windy', 'ancient', 'Parisian', 'streets', 'talk', 'careers', 'education', 'what', 'led', 'place', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'dialog', 'was', 'largely', 'scripted', 'actors', 'express', 'non-acting', 'interests', 'mirror', 'real', 'lives', 'Hawke', 'successful', 'novelist', 'Delpy', 'environmental', 'activist', 'musician', 'who', 'recorded', 'couple', 'albums', 'also', 'play', 'ages', 'play', 'characters', 'are', 'reasonably', 'successful', 'outward', 'sense', 'great', 'aura', 'realism', 'maintained', 'little', 'effort', 'dialog', 'ebb', 'flow', 'continue', 'easily', '80', 'minute', 'duration', 'real-time', 'walk', 'streets', 'gardens', 'Paris', 'life', 'career', 'love', 'lust', 'politics.And', 'may', 'seem', 'very', 'boring', 'what', 'expect', 'drama', 'event', 'expect', 'romances', 'be', 'full', 'sex', 'unbelievable', 'situations', 'jealousy', 'hysteria', 'SUNSET', '80', 'minutes', 'two', 'very', 'intelligent', 'articulate', 'people', 'reacquainting', 'other', 'reawakening', 'youthful', 'aspirations', 'romantic', 'hopes', 'assumed', 'were', 'withering', 'paean', 'French', 'ideals', 'American', 'excesses', 'Paris', 'music', 'architecture', 'literature', 'conveyed', 'expressions', 'words', 'two', 'hopeless', 'romantics', 'passion', 'director', 'noble', 'idea', 'so', 'rarely', 'practiced', 'importance', 'power', 'day', 'hour', 'minute', 'life.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'bit', 'perhaps', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'more', 'real', 'knowing', 'film', 'love', 'lost', 'past', 'hopeful', 'future', 'minimalist', 'tour', 'eyes', 'brazen', 'Texan', 'talkative', 'Parisian', 'easy', 'fall', 'love', 'actresses', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'simply', 'unbelievable', 'here', ""'ve"", 'rarely', 'felt', 'more', 'jealous', 'movie', 'did', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'who', 'rarely', 'perfect', 'here', 'was', 'earlier', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'wonderful', 'allusions', 'film', 'history', 'hour', 'third', 'most', 'potent', 'short', 'cruise', 'down', 'Seine', 'end', 'mind', 'most', 'obviously', 'two', 'most', 'romantic', 'expressionist', 'films', 'French', 'history', 'Vigo', ""L'ATALANTE"", '1934', 'Carax', 'LES', 'AMANTS', 'DU', 'PONT', 'NEUF', '1991', 'was', 'wondering', 'film', 'would', 'end', 'there', 'instead', 'couple', 'Celine', 'apartment', 'stunning', 'very', 'appropriate', 'finale.Along', 'predecessor', 'one', 'very', 'greatest', 'films', 'falling', 'love', 're-falling', 'history', 'cinema']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)

The rest of the time on the clock of course represents the times romance films have been maybe close but not spot on - or just flat out wrong. (Okay, that may be a little harsh - there have been a few other worthy romantic films in the recent past. But, in my opinion, none more focused or as gratifying as Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, especially taken together.)First, a little background. Before Sunrise, the film set prior to the story that takes place in Before Sunset, is about an American twenty-something in Vienna who meets his mental counterpart and soulmate on the last day of his overseas vacation. After a singular night of intellectual and passionate connections, Before Sunrise ends with the two main characters - Jesse, played by Ethan Hawke, and Celine, played by Julie Delpy - parting ways yearningly and agreeing to meet up at a prearranged spot six months later. I won't explain the hows and whys as to their agreement - you should just see the film to answer those questions. Now, in Before Sunset, Jesse and Celine pick up nine years after their first encounter. The film moves in real time from the beginning of their second meeting until the credits roll, following Jesse and Celine as they glide along through their rediscovery - each intently focused on the other as they wander the footpaths of Paris. In doing so, the film thoughtfully explores where these characters were situationally and emotionally, where they now are, and where they may be headed.The bottom line is that Before Sunset is a master work. There are other romantic films that have good things to offer, but none come to mind that approach the same level of psychological intimacy that these characters (and the audience) share, nor the same gratifying mix of character relatability, heartfelt longing, hope for the future, or romantic chemistry that this film has in spades. I loved the characters of Jesse and Celine - the fashion in which they intellectualize to make deeper connections; the obviousness of their mutual attraction barley held in place by the rules of societal etiquette; the way in which they disarm one another and ultimately forego all pretense to spill truths about their lives and their hopes - powerful, up close and personal stuff.In closing, I will just say that romance isn't even close to my favorite genre - horror/sci-fi films, thrillers, and actioners tend to be my go-tos. This fact should provide a clue as to the level of regard that I hold for these films. I can't imagine a better way to satisfy a craving to indulge in cinematic romance than to gorge ravenously on the emotional sustenance that these films provide. Having viewed each of these films several times, I really look forward to the day when we revisit these characters once again in a definitive third film. Here's hoping that lightning will strike again, and that the proverbial broken clock will ignore all laws of time and space and be right three times a day. Until then, my advice to you is to set aside an afternoon to take a walk down the dappled avenues of Paris (and Vienna) with Jesse and Celine.",5,An Unabashedly Romantic Film Bursting with Intelligence and Heart,1324512000,"12 22, 2011",2011,3338,"['know', 'saying', 'how', 'even', 'broken', 'clock', 'right', 'twice', 'day', 'Well', 'purposes', 'review', 'Sunset', 'prequel', 'Sunrise', 'represent', 'two', 'instances', 'clock', 'where', 'romance', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'right', 'rest', 'time', 'clock', 'course', 'times', 'romance', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'maybe', 'close', 'not', 'spot', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'wrong', 'Okay', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'harsh', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'other', 'worthy', 'romantic', 'films', 'recent', 'past', 'opinion', 'none', 'more', 'focused', 'as', 'gratifying', 'Sunrise', 'Before', 'Sunset', 'especially', 'taken', 'together', 'First', 'little', 'background', 'Sunrise', 'film', 'set', 'prior', 'story', 'place', 'Before', 'Sunset', 'American', 'twenty-something', 'Vienna', 'who', 'mental', 'counterpart', 'soulmate', 'last', 'day', 'overseas', 'vacation', 'singular', 'night', 'intellectual', 'passionate', 'connections', 'Sunrise', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Jesse', 'played', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Celine', 'played', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'parting', 'ways', 'yearningly', 'agreeing', 'meet', 'up', 'prearranged', 'spot', 'six', 'months', 'later', 'wo', ""n't"", 'explain', 'hows', 'whys', 'agreement', 'should', 'just', 'see', 'film', 'answer', 'questions', 'Now', 'Before', 'Sunset', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'pick', 'up', 'nine', 'years', 'first', 'encounter', 'film', 'moves', 'real', 'time', 'beginning', 'second', 'meeting', 'credits', 'roll', 'following', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'glide', 'along', 'rediscovery', 'intently', 'focused', 'other', 'wander', 'footpaths', 'Paris', 'doing', 'so', 'film', 'thoughtfully', 'where', 'characters', 'were', 'situationally', 'emotionally', 'where', 'now', 'are', 'where', 'may', 'be', 'headed.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'Sunset', 'master', 'work', 'are', 'other', 'romantic', 'films', 'have', 'good', 'things', 'offer', 'none', 'come', 'mind', 'approach', 'same', 'level', 'psychological', 'intimacy', 'characters', 'audience', 'share', 'same', 'gratifying', 'mix', 'character', 'relatability', 'heartfelt', 'longing', 'hope', 'future', 'romantic', 'chemistry', 'film', 'spades', 'loved', 'characters', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'fashion', 'intellectualize', 'make', 'deeper', 'connections', 'obviousness', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'barley', 'held', 'place', 'rules', 'societal', 'etiquette', 'way', 'disarm', 'one', 'ultimately', 'forego', 'pretense', 'spill', 'truths', 'lives', 'hopes', 'powerful', 'up', 'close', 'personal', 'stuff.In', 'closing', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'romance', ""n't"", 'even', 'close', 'favorite', 'genre', 'horror/sci-fi', 'films', 'thrillers', 'actioners', 'tend', 'be', 'go-tos', 'fact', 'should', 'provide', 'clue', 'level', 'regard', 'hold', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'better', 'way', 'satisfy', 'craving', 'indulge', 'cinematic', 'romance', 'gorge', 'ravenously', 'emotional', 'sustenance', 'films', 'provide', 'Having', 'viewed', 'films', 'several', 'times', 'really', 'look', 'forward', 'day', 'when', 'revisit', 'characters', 'once', 'again', 'definitive', 'third', 'film', 'Here', 'hoping', 'lightning', 'will', 'strike', 'again', 'proverbial', 'broken', 'clock', 'will', 'ignore', 'laws', 'time', 'space', 'be', 'right', 'three', 'times', 'day', 'then', 'advice', 'set', 'aside', 'afternoon', 'take', 'walk', 'dappled', 'avenues', 'Paris', 'Vienna', 'Jesse', 'Celine']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)

Basically, Before Sunrise chronicles the one-night adventures of two young people who happen upon one another while traveling in Europe. The couple enjoy a wonderful evening, and they make plans to meet each other again. The movie ends without explaining whether the two ever did meet up again.In Before Sunset, nine years have passed, and the two people run into each other at a Paris book shop. Their conversations start up again, and they decide to spend some time together before Jesse (Hawke) must catch a plane back to the United States.While I didn't find the movie earth-shattering or anything, I thought Delpy turned in a GREAT performance. She had a very natural style of delivery in this film. I wonder how much of the dialogue was scripted and how much was ad-libbed . . . ? It was a short movie, which I also thought was a good choice. (There's only so much of characters chit chatting while they leg it around Europe that one can take.)

I hadn't seen it since I saw it in the theatres back in 2004.In ""Before Subset"" (2004 release; 80 min.), Jessie (Ethan Hawke) is on a book tour in Paris, and Celine (Julie Delpy) comes to the book store where Jessie is speaking. After the event, Jessie has about 90 min. before he needs to go to the airport to catch his plan back to New York (the movie is brought in real time, a rarity these days). Jessie and Celine decide to go take a walk in Paris, get a coffee, and catch up on the last nine years since their one night in Vienna (""Before Sunrise"").Several comments: this movie has held up very well. I liked it better than ""Before Sunrise"" when I first saw it, and I still feel that way today. The script is co-written by director Richard Linklater and the co-stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. In my opinion, there is one thing in the movie that does not resonate with me: these 2 people have not seen each other for 9 years and are catching up on everything. hence does it seem normal or logical to you that it takes 40 min. into the movie before Celine asks Jessie about his personal life (""so I read you are married and have a kid"")? Not to me. Under those circumstances, it would probably be one of the first questions people would ask of each other. But aside that, the script is pretty much perfect. The movie shines in the last 20 min. as all of the emotions are released. One of the best scenes in the movie is when Celine finally gives in to Jessie's request to sing a song. She picks up her guitar and brings ""Let Me Sing You a Walz"". Bottom line: this movie is a rarity in US cinema: strictly a talk movie, where literally NOTHING happens, other than two people talking with each other for the entire movie. And not only that, but you care about these characters and are invested in them so much that you don't want it to end. I am SO looking forward to seeing ""Before Midnight"". Meanwhile, ""Before Sunset"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4,"4.5 stars...

851267,A1MC81HLJ6Z9ZQ,B0002YLC24,Paul McGrath,"[14, 24]","A star-crossed romance is the subject of this brave little film, and although it should be commended for its honest attempt to recreate a slice of life--and also its bare-bones plot, which is simply a conversation between the two protagonists--it ultimately does not succeed.The premise is that the two leads had a romantic encounter nine years earlier--interestingly  documented in the 1995 film Before Sunrise--but fate intervened and their romance was abruptly terminated.  This film takes place nine years after and the fellow, played by Ethan Hawke, has written a best-selling novel based on this experience.  On a book-selling tour in lovely Paris, his old flame--Julie Delpy--shows up, and the two reacquaint themselves with one another.  That's it.It's a great premise and a daring exercise but the movie fails because Ethan Hawke simply does not have the emotional or intellectual depth to pull it off.  During the course of the film we learn that since their encounter he has spent four years working on the novel, several months in a Trappist monastery, has married, and has a four-year old son.  His marriage, we come to find, has not been successful.  It took place primarily because his wife became pregnant, and he now realizes that he does not love her and that they share little in common.One would think that events such as these would have a profound effect on him.  The, ""happily-ever-after,"" sort of marriage that he envisioned--that we all envision--did not happen, and now there is the complicating factor of the love he feels for his four-year old.  These are the kinds of things which should lend some gravity to one's persona, but Hawke unfortunately can't seem to convey this, coming across instead as the puppy-doggish American college student on his first--all right, his second--European lark.  Undoubtedly, this worked well in the first film, but again, the first film took place literally and fictionally nine years earlier.  His character does not reflect the emotional scars he supposedly suffered subsequently.Another serious problem is that much of the dialogue is obviously improvised, and again, Mr. Hawke is not up to the task.  Remember, he is an author, a best-selling author who has spent four years on his book, yet his end of the conversation is practically witless and his vocabulary is that of a fourteen-year old.  Worse, he punctuates practically every phrase--he really doesn't speak in sentences--with, ""you know,"" or, ""ya know,"" or, ""you know what I'm saying""-s.  It would not be possible to recount how often he uttered one of these, but an educated guess would be about 500 times.  This is an eighty-minute movie.In contrast, Julie Delpy is superb.  Hers is a woman who is maturing, who is no longer so sure of her beauty, who has become slightly frantic about her gradual loss of those things that youth gives to us so freely.  Not beautiful, not unattractive, she comes across as vulnerable, and real.  Her persona is that of an idealist--a bohemian type--but one who is now sadly beginning to recognize that her role in this world may not change it much, and that romantic love is not something she can automatically expect.  Though occasionally emotional, the last scene of the film shows us that she will get through this, and is in fact well on her way to achieving a sense of serenity.  It is a fine, nuanced performance;  utterly convincing and very poignant.Unfortunately, it is a performance that is not matched.  Although the ending of the film would lead one to believe that their relationship may continue, it is with a sense of disbelief that the filmgoer contemplates this.  Surely, this emotionally complex woman would never become involved with one so clearly incapable of matching her depth.",2,Hawke Unconvincing,1112054400,"03 29, 2005",2005,3762,"['star-crossed', 'romance', 'subject', 'brave', 'little', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'honest', 'attempt', 'recreate', 'slice', 'life', 'also', 'bare-bones', 'plot', 'simply', 'conversation', 'two', 'protagonists', 'ultimately', 'not', 'succeed.The', 'premise', 'two', 'leads', 'had', 'romantic', 'encounter', 'nine', 'years', 'earlier', 'interestingly', 'documented', '1995', 'film', 'Sunrise', 'fate', 'intervened', 'romance', 'was', 'abruptly', 'terminated', 'film', 'place', 'nine', 'years', 'fellow', 'played', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'written', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'based', 'experience', 'book-selling', 'tour', 'lovely', 'Paris', 'old', 'flame', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'up', 'two', 'reacquaint', 'one', 'it.It', 'great', 'premise', 'daring', 'exercise', 'movie', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'simply', 'not', 'have', 'emotional', 'intellectual', 'depth', 'pull', 'off', 'course', 'film', 'learn', 'encounter', 'spent', 'four', 'years', 'working', 'novel', 'several', 'months', 'Trappist', 'monastery', 'married', 'four-year', 'old', 'son', 'marriage', 'come', 'find', 'not', 'been', 'successful', 'took', 'place', 'primarily', 'wife', 'became', 'pregnant', 'now', 'not', 'love', 'share', 'little', 'common.One', 'would', 'think', 'events', 'such', 'would', 'have', 'profound', 'effect', 'happily-ever-after', 'sort', 'marriage', 'envisioned', 'envision', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'now', 'complicating', 'factor', 'love', 'four-year', 'old', 'are', 'kinds', 'things', 'should', 'lend', 'gravity', 'one', 'persona', 'Hawke', 'unfortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'convey', 'coming', 'across', 'instead', 'puppy-doggish', 'American', 'college', 'student', 'first', 'right', 'second', 'European', 'lark', 'Undoubtedly', 'worked', 'well', 'first', 'film', 'again', 'first', 'film', 'took', 'place', 'literally', 'fictionally', 'nine', 'years', 'earlier', 'character', 'not', 'reflect', 'emotional', 'scars', 'supposedly', 'suffered', 'subsequently.Another', 'serious', 'problem', 'much', 'dialogue', 'obviously', 'improvised', 'again', 'Mr.', 'Hawke', 'not', 'up', 'task', 'Remember', 'author', 'best-selling', 'author', 'who', 'spent', 'four', 'years', 'book', 'yet', 'end', 'conversation', 'practically', 'witless', 'vocabulary', 'fourteen-year', 'old', 'Worse', 'practically', 'phrase', 'really', ""n't"", 'speak', 'sentences', 'know', 'ya', 'know', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'saying', '-s.', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'possible', 'recount', 'how', 'often', 'uttered', 'one', 'educated', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'about', '500', 'times', 'eighty-minute', 'movie.In', 'contrast', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'superb', 'Hers', 'woman', 'who', 'maturing', 'who', 'longer', 'so', 'sure', 'beauty', 'who', 'become', 'slightly', 'frantic', 'gradual', 'loss', 'things', 'youth', 'so', 'freely', 'Not', 'beautiful', 'not', 'unattractive', 'vulnerable', 'real', 'persona', 'idealist', 'bohemian', 'type', 'one', 'who', 'now', 'sadly', 'beginning', 'recognize', 'role', 'world', 'may', 'not', 'change', 'much', 'romantic', 'love', 'not', 'something', 'can', 'automatically', 'expect', 'Though', 'occasionally', 'emotional', 'last', 'scene', 'film', 'will', 'get', 'fact', 'well', 'way', 'achieving', 'sense', 'serenity', 'fine', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'very', 'poignant.Unfortunately', 'performance', 'not', 'matched', 'ending', 'film', 'would', 'lead', 'one', 'believe', 'relationship', 'may', 'continue', 'sense', 'disbelief', 'filmgoer', 'Surely', 'emotionally', 'complex', 'woman', 'would', 'never', 'become', 'involved', 'one', 'so', 'clearly', 'incapable', 'matching', 'depth']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)

Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy has matured in their craft of film-making and now, they are behind the camera as much as in front of the camera.  Perhaps, the Director had more say to the direction nine years ago in making ""Before Sunrise"", in the sequel version of it, both actor, actress and the Director got themselves involved in the character development, screenplay and so forth.  Whilst the extra features in the DVD is far and between, it is sufficient to show us the bits where both actor and actress went through one scene (almost nine minutes long) in one take.  Both of them were obviously ""in the zone"" and they got the scene nailed.  Other than the fact that the dialogues were pacey, it's obvious that the dialogues were ridden of any corny or pretentious moments.  The characters simply talked as any long lost friends would have.  The superficial conversation were subsequently replaced by their private thoughts, and emotions were divulged.  Both characters wondered what would have been, the relationships they were in with other people despite their strong chemistry, and analysing the ""what if"" should they ended up together as they were supposed to.  Many reviewers came to conclusion that in the end, the couple came together but the ending was open-ended.  In accordance with the Director, with consensus from both actor and actress, this ""Before..."" franchise shall become a work-in-progress, a journal about love, of love that transcends time and place.  An honest and bittersweet love story that is beautifully crafted.  I'm sure there are many of us out there that would love to end up with the persons that we love.  Alas, as life would have it, circumstances at time would prevent the union.  Yet, it doesn't mean that the love would dissipate.  On contrary, it would burn stronger.  And with that, it gives us hope and with hope, we can look forward towards a brighter future.

Saw ""Before Sunrise"" many years ago and was wondering if there would be a sequel.It was worth waiting for it. Contrary to some reviews posted, it is my belief that watching ""Before Sunrise"" is a pre-requisite to watching ""Before Sunset"".The dialogues are profound, especially in ""Before Sunset"", and they are what gives the sense of regaining connection after nine years with Celine and Jesse and how life has turned out wrong for the both of them.They have put to bed - as Jesse says in one of the dialogues - the notion of a ""romantic love"" on that December 16. But it is so poignant watching these two people grasping the moment (and the chance) to fulfill their most cherished dreams.What is noteworth, though, is that there is no loving, sensual or desperate kissing. Actually the only kisses they exchange are the ones that European people use to greet old friends. Most of the time they do not even touch each other, but you can see the connection between them in subtle gestures, looks exchanged, and the conversation.And the most beautiful scene, in my opinion, is when Jesse is talking about the dreams he has and how he wakes up sobbing and Celine tries to touch him...This movie is worth seeing but to really appreciate it, you must forget about the fast paced action that are good only for the eyes.

The script may seem boring for Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, but that is only true when you find the concept of being alone with a beautiful woman in an intense one-on-one boring.  This concept may be terrifying to some guys.  Otherwise, you will find the patience to endure the cinematic buildup to the inevitable end: The soul mates converge.Celine: Baby, you are going to miss your plane.Jesse: I knowShe had been urging him for hours to watch the time.

After the first movie I was more prepared for the mesmerizing experience.With pomegranate in hand (a good substitute for popcorn), I watched with a sense of anticipatory wonder. Would these two ever connect on more than a soul level, did they connect before and would this continuing conversation lead to some mutual fulfillment? I was not disappointed.The playful banter reaches some humorous high points that are beyond witty. Celine and Jesse seem to share a natural chemistry, which allows them to speak honestly without fear of rejection. Together they find a delicate balance of revelation and anticipation.What amazed me most is the extended scenes filled with complex conversations. The entire plot truly happens more in the characters minds than onscreen. The casual natural sets are still magical, but I think the best scene is in the first movie when Celine and Jesse are kissing under the stars.

Before the relationship can sour or a real disagreement can develop, goodbye is said and both parties move on.What happens though when the parties don't exactly follow the above? When they both realize that a perfect connection was the true connection - love - and that it was a lost opportunity?

The original film was released in 1995, and told the tale of an American college boy (Jesse, played by Ethan Hawke) and a French college girl (Celine, played by Julie Delpy), who meet on a train in Europe and spend a romantic night together in Vienna.So, Before Sunset does not pick up exactly where we left off last time. Instead, nine years have passed, and Celine has tracked down Jesse in Paris, where he's appearing at Shakespeare and Company for a book-signing. Jesse has been touring Europe, promoting his new book, which is, in fact, based somewhat on that previous romantic night together. Finished with the book-signing, Jesse and Celine go to a cafe, walk the streets and gardens of Paris, and take a short cruise up the Seine. All the while, they are talking about how they lost contact with each other, lost loves, how their lives have changed in the nine years, and those things in life, big and snall, that matter to them. Hawke and Delpy pull their roles off perfectly: a little more jaded, but still thoughtful and conversation-oriented.The film is shot as if it were really in real-time...no real scene breaks punctuate the story, just changes in scenery. So, instead, we can take pleasure of observing the 80-minute conversation between two people who should clearly be together, and only the vagarities of circumstance have kept them apart. This is very different than most films you see. Back in the mid-90s, when I first watched Before Sunrise, that film had some meaning for me, as it represented the kind of romance and relationship I was seeking. Now, with this film, I see things nicely book-ended, and I see a mirror of the type of relationship I actually have...one in which thoughtful conversation is important.And, it was nice to see Paris again.So, check it out if you have a chance!",5,Sunrise...sunset...,1147564800,"05 14, 2006",2006,2231,"['spent', 'part', 'afternoon', 'out', 'theatre', 'watching', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'III', ""'m"", 'not', 'here', 'write', 'getting', 'new', 'battery', 'watch', 'picking', 'up', 'chicken', 'green', 'onions', 'mushrooms', 'are', 'now', 'baking', 'away', 'oven.Instead', ""'m"", 'going', 'write', 'Before', 'Sunset', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'sequel', 'sorts', 'previous', 'Sunrise', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1995', 'told', 'tale', 'American', 'college', 'boy', 'Jesse', 'played', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'French', 'college', 'girl', 'Celine', 'played', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'who', 'meet', 'train', 'Europe', 'spend', 'romantic', 'night', 'together', 'Vienna.So', 'Sunset', 'not', 'pick', 'up', 'exactly', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'last', 'time', 'Instead', 'nine', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'Celine', 'tracked', 'down', 'Jesse', 'Paris', 'where', 'appearing', 'Shakespeare', 'Company', 'book-signing', 'Jesse', 'been', 'touring', 'Europe', 'promoting', 'new', 'book', 'fact', 'based', 'somewhat', 'previous', 'romantic', 'night', 'together', 'Finished', 'book-signing', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'go', 'cafe', 'walk', 'streets', 'gardens', 'Paris', 'take', 'short', 'cruise', 'Seine', 'while', 'are', 'talking', 'how', 'lost', 'contact', 'other', 'lost', 'loves', 'how', 'lives', 'have', 'changed', 'nine', 'years', 'things', 'life', 'big', 'snall', 'matter', 'Hawke', 'Delpy', 'pull', 'roles', 'off', 'perfectly', 'little', 'more', 'jaded', 'still', 'thoughtful', 'conversation-oriented.The', 'film', 'shot', 'were', 'really', 'real-time', 'real', 'scene', 'breaks', 'punctuate', 'story', 'just', 'changes', 'scenery', 'So', 'instead', 'can', 'take', 'pleasure', 'observing', '80-minute', 'conversation', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'should', 'clearly', 'be', 'together', 'only', 'vagarities', 'circumstance', 'have', 'kept', 'apart', 'very', 'different', 'most', 'films', 'see', 'Back', 'mid-90s', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'Sunrise', 'film', 'had', 'meaning', 'represented', 'kind', 'romance', 'relationship', 'was', 'seeking', 'Now', 'film', 'see', 'things', 'nicely', 'book-ended', 'see', 'mirror', 'type', 'relationship', 'actually', 'have', 'one', 'thoughtful', 'conversation', 'important.And', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Paris', 'again.So', 'check', 'out', 'have', 'chance']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)

851282,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0002YLC24,RMurray847,"[10, 12]","First, right off the bat, let me say that you MUST see Before Sunrise prior to watching this film.  While I suppose you might still enjoy it without the prior viewing (you are offered a few scattered flashbacks of the previous film), I believe your appreciation of its subtleties will be HUGELY diminished without it.  And it's a rare treat to be able to revisit characters you got to know in one film ten years later.I actually watched BEFORE SUNRISE again just one day prior to viewing BEFORE SUNSET.  In my opinion, that's the way to go...because there are little things in the first film that come up in film #2...it helps enjoy the movie to remember those little moments yourself.BEFORE SUNRISE was the story of two young college-aged kids who meet on a train to Vienna, and he (Ethan Hawke) convinces here (Julie Delpy) to hang out with him for the night, before he has to fly back to the states.  From there, they wander the scenic streets of Vienna, mostly talking, and falling in love.  We see how the intellectual connection is made almost simultaneously with the physical attraction...and it's almost palpable how convincing the film is.  At the end, the couple agrees to meet again in one year at the exact spot. Will they come together again?  We don't know.BEFORE SUNSET answers that question and many others.  I will NOT be a spoiler here, but let's just say that in the 9 years that passed since the last film, Hawke and Delpy have not been together the whole time.  How and why?  I won't say.This time, they meet in Paris.  Both actors are clearly older.  Hawke is gaunt to the point of emaciation.  Delpy has aged around the eyes in particular.  What's cool is that as the two reunite, we can see the age lifting from them.  Yes, they look older, but as they spend the time together, they begin to feel like their younger selves again.Ethan Hawke is not a favorite actor of mine.  In most films, I find him boring or affected.  He's also a very pretentious writer...and I don't like that he dumped Uma Thurman.  Anyway, in these little gems, he is terrific.  The conversational, improvised tone fits him very well, and he's convincing.  Delpy, whom I haven't seen in much else, is very good.  Her character has many annoying little traits, but she's also so open about the joy she takes in things.  And both characters have bristling, active intellects.  It's fun to watch smart people making a connection.  They're both quick witted and funny, especially Delpy.The first film was mostly upbeat...even though we knew they had to part ways, there was so much fun in watching them connect so convincingly.  The movie captured the ebullience of young love.  BEFORE SUNSET is infused with melancholy.  The characters are older, and have been battered a bit by life...especially their own decisions.  Neither has been a failure, yet neither is happy either.  And they are tormented (especially Hawke) by what ""could have been.""  There's some resentment there, and it pops up from time to time, even as they rebuild their bond.  They aren't as carefree and open as they once were.  All of that reads as very convincing and believable.The final ten minutes or so of the film are about as quiet and tiny as any you'll see.  We REALLY feel we're eavesdropping.  The tension is thick.  Time is running out (Hawke has a plane to catch) and we can literally feel the need to cling to every last second.  The ending is the ultimate in bittersweet.I admire the films because they dialogue, while probably more intelligent and witty then any of us could muster up, FEELS real.  And there's a lot of it, and it's fun to listen to.  The actors also listen to each other very avidly.  It all feels authentic, and makes you realize how many movies really don't.  The films aren't stylish or noisy.  The filmmaking is NOT flashy.  Director Richard Linklater knows what the strengths are and doesn't tamper with them.Is the movie perfect?  No.  Sometimes we realize that these two people might not be people we would actually like if we met them.  They are a bit full of themselves.  But on the other hand, it's a strength that they aren't afraid to have some significant warts too.  And the opening scene, where Hawke is in a bookstore (before he's met Delpy) feels too contrived...it's only an excuse to show some scenes from the previous film.  But these quibbles are REALLY minor.I recommend both movies to adults...particularly if you've had love in your life or been an adult for at least ten years.

Crawford,"[7, 7]","That is what this film meant to me, looking at the kaleidiscope of life as it passes by, so sweet, so unsatisfying at times yet so perfect when the right person is there.This film is a poem to Paris and the passing of youth, with the hope of recapturing that one love, which when found engraves itself so deeply that it is like a hinge in the mind, always present, always remembered, always desired.The two lovers meet, seemingly a lifetime away from when they met by chance on a train, and with instant rapport they tell eachother in the space of a few hours everything that happened since they met 10 years earlier.  They see how much they meant to eachother, how much they still could, like two pieces of a puzzle that fit.This is a genuinely beautiful film, more mature than the last one, much sadder and in many ways better and more realistic.  It opened that sense of mystery that I have known, in life and its surprises and potential in the luck of finding true intimacy.Julie Delphy is one of those rare women who gets more beautiful as she ages.  She has become a sad person, stalled in relationships, though she is living up to her ideals.  Ethan Hawke is struggling to grow with his success, in a down phase of his marriage and needing their friendship very badly.  Their relationship, so brief, rings totally true, in its humor, commitment, and occasional awkwardness.Perhaps this is sentimental, but I think I have known love like this.  It is an image more in my mind than the person perhaps, but our friendship is as deep as it was when we met nearly 35 years ago.  Some people simply pierce thru to the heart, earning a permanent place no matter who they later marry or what they become.  It is an extraordinary sympathy for one another that is beyond sex (well, maybe not too far beyond...).Highest recommendation.  This succeeds brilliantly at a snapshot in time, with an entire history implied behind it, like the greatest art.  And I do think that the ending is ambiguous and must be interpreted, which is also so very much like real life.",5,"Paris, in real time, with the image - so permanently fixed - of love",1148342400,"05 23, 2006",2006,2059,"['what', 'film', 'meant', 'looking', 'kaleidiscope', 'life', 'so', 'sweet', 'so', 'unsatisfying', 'times', 'yet', 'so', 'perfect', 'when', 'right', 'person', 'there.This', 'film', 'poem', 'Paris', 'passing', 'youth', 'hope', 'recapturing', 'one', 'love', 'when', 'found', 'so', 'deeply', 'hinge', 'mind', 'always', 'present', 'always', 'remembered', 'always', 'desired.The', 'two', 'lovers', 'meet', 'seemingly', 'lifetime', 'away', 'when', 'met', 'chance', 'train', 'instant', 'rapport', 'tell', 'eachother', 'space', 'few', 'hours', 'everything', 'happened', 'met', '10', 'years', 'earlier', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'meant', 'eachother', 'how', 'much', 'still', 'could', 'two', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'fit.This', 'genuinely', 'beautiful', 'film', 'more', 'mature', 'last', 'one', 'much', 'sadder', 'many', 'ways', 'better', 'more', 'realistic', 'opened', 'sense', 'mystery', 'have', 'known', 'life', 'surprises', 'potential', 'luck', 'finding', 'true', 'intimacy.Julie', 'Delphy', 'one', 'rare', 'women', 'who', 'more', 'beautiful', 'become', 'sad', 'person', 'stalled', 'relationships', 'living', 'up', 'ideals', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'struggling', 'grow', 'success', 'down', 'phase', 'marriage', 'needing', 'friendship', 'very', 'badly', 'relationship', 'so', 'brief', 'rings', 'totally', 'true', 'humor', 'commitment', 'occasional', 'awkwardness.Perhaps', 'sentimental', 'think', 'have', 'known', 'love', 'image', 'more', 'mind', 'person', 'perhaps', 'friendship', 'as', 'deep', 'was', 'when', 'met', 'nearly', '35', 'years', 'ago', 'people', 'simply', 'pierce', 'thru', 'heart', 'earning', 'permanent', 'place', 'matter', 'who', 'later', 'marry', 'what', 'become', 'extraordinary', 'sympathy', 'one', 'sex', 'well', 'maybe', 'not', 'too', 'far', '.Highest', 'recommendation', 'brilliantly', 'snapshot', 'time', 'entire', 'history', 'implied', 'greatest', 'art', 'do', 'think', 'ending', 'ambiguous', 'must', 'be', 'interpreted', 'also', 'so', 'very', 'much', 'real', 'life']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)

I think most people would find it mildly interesting but definitely not essential.The film itself:  ""Before Sunset"" is the sequel to ""Before Sunrise,"" a wonderful little film from 1995.  You don't have to see that film first, but I'd recommend doing so anyway, because it's very good, and because it increases the emotional impact of ""Before Sunset"".If you have seen ""Before Sunrise"" and liked it, you will almost certainly like ""Before Sunset."" If you found it boring or otherwise unappealing, then skip ""Sunset."" The two films share a lot in common: an overwhelming focus on the two main characters, lots of good dialog, and a very sweet love story.There are a few differences:The acting is better in ""Before Sunset."" The Jesse character (Ethan Hawke) is more likeable in ""Before Sunset"" (some people found him slightly annoying in the prequel). In the sequel, there seems to be more tension: they only have 80 minutes rather than a whole night to figure out if they should be together. There's also more at stake: it's so rare in life to find someone with whom you truly connect, and if you let them go, it's even more rare to get a second chance with them later.Many people who really liked the prequel said that seeing the sequel gave them the sensation of visiting old friends. I felt this too.I *URGE* you to be very careful about reading other user reviews. Most reviews I've seen give too many hints about the ending.Those of you who have already seen this film may be interested in discussing the ending. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET, STOP READING NOW!*** SPOILER ALERT! ***Most people have an opinion about the ending of ""Before Sunset."" Some love it, some hate it, but most are frustrated by the ambiguity, at least initially. Do they stay together? Or does each of them return to their committed relationship?We can't be certain what happens, but the writers (Linklater and the two lead actors) have given us some very strong clues.In the final scene, the song playing on Celine's stereo is called ""Just in Time,"" performed by Nina Simone. Simone is famous for singing very moving, haunting, sad songs. But ""Just in Time"" is quite happy: ""Just in time/I found you just in time/before you came, my time was running low/I was lost/the losing dice were tossed/my bridges all crossed/nowhere to go/Now you're here and now I know just where I'm going/no more doubt or fear/I've found my way/For love came just in time/you found me just in time/and changed my lonely life.""Why do you think the writers picked that song? What do you think it tells us?(It also might be interesting that Nina Simone was an American living in France. Jesse is American, will he move to France?)In that final scene, Celine is dancing and playfully singing along with Nina Simone, while Jesse is smiling and enjoying her performance. The last thing Celine says to Jesse is ""Baby, you're going to miss that plane,"" and the last thing he says to her is ""that's right"" (or something to that effect). Does this sound like how two people who love each other would act if one of them was about to fly away and they were never going to see each other again?Maybe the ending is not so ambiguous, after all.",5,Sublime.

851289,A61WRN3Y04WU8,B0002YLC24,"Ryan L. ""Ryan Lattanzio""","[48, 52]","Maybe I sound biased because Richard Linklater's 1995 film Before Sunrise is one of my ten or so all time favorite films, but this improved (and I thought that would be impossible!) sequel to an infinitely great film is truly the best film (so far) of 2004. The screenplay, co-written by director Richard Linklater and stars Julie Delpy & Ethan Hawke, is probably one of the most refreshing of this decade. It succeeds on so many levels because of the development of this relationship and the fact that Delpy and Hawke have such a three dimensional knowledge of these complex characters-no, human beings. Fictional of course, but they are still the most humanistic screen ""couple"" I've ever seen.Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy), separated for nine years, are undeniably the soul mates often described in their conversations, the ones that dig deeper than small talk. On a book tour in Paris, where Celine now lives, Jesse finds her watching him through a window as he absentmindedly describes the book he has written, which concerns two fictional lovers who meet and spend a night together-quite obviously autobiographical, when the question is implied by an interviewer. From there on, the two reunite and spend a brief but unforgettable afternoon in Paris, wandering the streets.The screenplay and direction are flawless. The dialogue and its delivery is so natural, so uncontrived I was convinced even more that these were real people that I knew. After all, I've waited nine years too (okay, not really, I only saw Sunrise a year ago). Linklater just observes all that is going on without overly glamorizing it. Delpy and Hawke take this dialogue and make it into their own-they are those Celine and Jesse as far as I'm concerned. Some of the best acting this year can be found in Sunset.The city of Paris serves as a fluid and dreamlike backdrop to the graceful and powerful, bittersweet and engrossing talk. Sunset is well filmed, and embraces just enough of Paris, which in fact would be more noticeable upon the inevitable second viewing. This city has never looked better on the screen!I liked the fact that both Jesse and Celine expressed their true feelings through an art form, he with a book, and she with a song. This clearly conveys the message that there still exists romanticism in each of them despite each characters' biting cynicism. Although they never once said a word along the lines of ""I love you,"" you know throughout the entire film that they are still in love with each other. Maybe I am reading too deeply into this film, but I strongly believe that the first place that the two go, the caf&eacute;, is almost like a complete reenactment of the train sequence in certain ways-it is the beginning of their journey and each place is mutual ground where Jesse and Celine are not under pressure, but they can just talk without interruptions or worries about the past.By the time the ending came around, I held back tears in my eyes-out of happiness for these characters.

They flirt, banter, and make silly comments about politics and art. Although they clearly indicate that, during the interim, they have developed complicated lives, they ignore the issue of how complicated it would likewise be for them to be together.

851292,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B0002YLC24,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[3, 4]","""Before Sunset"" is the sequel to 1995's ""Before Sunrise,"" which followed Jessie (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) on a magical night in Vienna.  Nine years later, our protagonists are older, wiser, and more wounded by love and relationships, desperately clinging to the idea of how their lives would have changed if they had met each other as planned six months after their first encounter.Jessie is in Paris promoting his new book at Shakespeare and Co. bookstore, on the last leg of a whirlwind publicity tour of ten cities in twelve days, when Celine shows up at the question and answer session. Floored, Jessie slips out with Celine for a quick coffee, which predictably turns into a late afternoon bathed in Paris's charms and beauty: a bateau mouche (boat ride) down the Seine (""It's for tourists!"" Celine protests weakly), walking through quiet, manicured gardens, sharing a coffee in a typical Paris caf&eacute;, and finally, listening to Nina Simone in Celine's charming (and cluttered apartment).The late afternoon light bathes Paris in a hazy film of romance and possibility. The locations, from narrow Parisian sidestreets, cruising under ponts (bridges) on the Seine, to landmarks such as Notre Dame, are stunning, and seem much more alive than did Vienna in the first film. Jessie and Celine have grown up: Jessie is married with children, and Celine is in a relationship with a war photojournalist, but the initial attraction in Vienna is still there, only tempered with anger and bitterness at life's unfairness. Much of the film is spent in arguments about the cruelty of love, trapped in loveless relationships, and giving up on the hope of ever meeting ""the one."" This film is much more grounded in reality, and as such, is missing a bit of the feel-good romance from ""Before Sunrise."" There is also much more graphic dialogue concerning sex and sex acts in frank, frequently explicit language, although no sex occurs in the film.The ending, at least, is much more open-ended and positive than its predecessor, and Ethan Hawke mentions in the behind-the-scenes feature that he hopes to follow Celine and Jessie down the road, perhaps every ten years or so. The DVD comes with the theatrical trailer and a ten-minute behind-the-scenes feature which shows limited filming on location and interviews with Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy, and director Richard Linklater. Bonus: the French-language track was dubbed in Qu&eacute;bec rather than France. (For someone from Qu&eacute;bec, there's poetic justice in hearing Parisians speak with a (loathed) Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois accent!)

They tried to talk me out of seeing it. Of course I began to feel a bit apprehensive at their apparent negative reviews, I surely wasn't expecting such distaste from fellow movie-goers. But now looking back, I'm glad I gave little credence to them and saw BEFORE SUNSET anyways because it is simply a wonderful and beautiful film. It goes far beyond just two people walking and talking.Nine years after having a one-night stand in Vienna Celine and Jesse meet up again in Paris while Jesse is on a tour promoting his new book that just happens to be about the one night he spent with Celine. While walking through the quaint Parisian gardens before his plane leaves for New York, they catch up with each other's lives since they last saw each other and it is apparent that sexual tension and an intense interest continue to exist between them. Their dialogue often drifts from displays of serious emotions to more frivolous topics, but there is an element that keeps the audience continually interested.The running time is brief and the film is entirely shot in real time (there are no time lapses) thus creating a voyeuristic feeling of the audience eavesdropping on their conversation and following them through the park. Without giving anything away, the film's abrupt ending was magnificent, certainly unexpected, and honestly left me a bit frustrated. I don't know if there will be another sequel but I'm content to just leave things as they were left.All in all, BEFORE SUNSET is a touching film filled with romance and wonder.

Like the light, this film has a transitory brilliance that must be taken in slowly, gently, to appreciate all the different nuances and layers taken to create it. What makes this film work so amazingly is its simplicity; these characters walk around, discuss everything from world politics to the meaning of life, and realize how important they are to eachother. From that is borne the film's main strength- we care so much about these people that their pending seperation creates an overwhelming amount of tension, making the film consistently entertaining and a joy to watch. There is also a well-executed sense of melancholy with Jese and Celine, apparent through great acting and writing.

""Before Sunrise,"" the first collaboration between Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy, and Richard Linkater (now of ""School of Rock"" fame) was a classic 90's ""indie"" film.  Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy) meet by chance and spend a day and a night in Vienna together.  After one of the most romantic 24 hours in cinema history, Jesse departs for America, but they plan to meet at the same train platform in 6 months.""Before Sunset"" takes place 9 years later, and Jesse and Celine meet by chance in Paris.  Unfortunately (mild spoiler alert, but this is a spoiler that makes ""Before Sunset"" work), due to circumstances beyond their control that reunion didn't occur.  So Celine and Jesse have a few hours to spend together before Jesse has to fly back to his life in the States.  Using the same basic technique of filming Jesse and Delpy as they walk and talk as the first movie, ""Before Sunset"" catches lightning in a bottle once again.What makes ""Before Sunset"" so poignant is how well Delpy and Hawke inhabit Celine and Jesse -- these are career-defining roles for both of them.  It's important to note that Delpy and Hawke share screenwriting credits on this movie with Linklater.  Their conversations unfold so effortlessly, so charmingly, that nobody can doubt that we are watching two soulmates reunite, and quite frankly it's a wonder that Hawke and Delpy didn't become a Hollywood couple, there's so much chemistry between the two.But Celine and Jesse are nine years older, and there are deep currents at issue in ""Before Sunset.""  That perfect night in Vienna 9 years ago may have been romantic, but it left a lot of scars, too.  Celine and Jesse explore the depth of those wounds after their conversations move beyond the awkward polite reunion phase.  For two souls whom we have only seen on romantic outings, they have both spent 9 years being pretty unhappy, and that's a shocker.A fantastically written and wonderfully acted little movie (clocking in at a mere 80 minutes, counting final credits), ""Before Sunset"" is a perfect bookend to ""Before Sunrise.""  As wonderful as ""Before Sunset"" is, you absolutely must see ""Before Sunrise"" first.

Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) pick up where they left off a little under ten years ago in ""Before Sunrise""--he's in Paris to promote his book, which just so happens to be about his encounter with Celine all those years ago, and she shows up at the book signing. They then wander the streets of Paris together, and the conversation flows as easily as it did back then. After all those years, there's still such chemistry and connection between them, and in the end, that's what the film is about--how often do we meet people that we truly connect with? The film is basically one long, involving, wonderfully interesting conversation, so if you love gigantic Hollywood action packed sequences, this might not be right for you.

851298,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B0002YLC24,Sean Pasek,"[2, 2]","I was a huge fan of Before Sunrise when it came out.  I loved the simplicity and realism of two young people, who just met, walking around a beautiful European city like Vienna, and getting to know each other.You might wonder what they have left to talk about in this film since they tackled so many subjects in the previous one.  Believe me, they have plenty to talk about, and you wish that this film would never end.The story takes place nine years after the previous film.  Jesse is now a successful author who is doing a book tour throughout Europe.  Paris is his last stop.  He's sitting in a small book shop, answering questions from some readers, when he looks over his shoulder and sees Celine standing there.  The film takes off from there as Jesse and Celine spend a few precious hours together before Jesse must be at the airport to make his flight.Ethan Hawke (Jesse) and Julie Delpy (Celine) both co-wrote this screenplay along with the director.  It's obvious that these two actors know their characters so well, that I'm sure that even they had spent those ""nine years"" wondering how it would end.  Does Jesse come back for that six-month-later reunion?  Does Celine?  Do people, who really live so far away able to keep, what seems to be an unlikely promise?I'm not going to relate anything else about the story here for those who have not seen the movie yet.  This is a film where the thrill is in the journey, not the goal.  Each step that Jesse and Celine make as they walk around Paris, is another step in that journey.I recall telling friends about the first film and what it was about.  They couldn't understand how a movie about two people walking around could be so good.  But just like that first film, their conversations are so real and enthralling.  I think part of the reason that it's so compelling is that when these two characters are together, they are themselves.  There is no fakery or need to put on another face in order to impress the other.  Perhaps because they are in a time crunch, they figure that there's no need to be anything other than genuine because they don't feel that they'll ever see each other again.  There is a powerful scene in this film that is a recognition and a tribute to that ""genuiness"" and why they feel more comfortable with each other than with anyone else they've ever been with.I've always said that sometimes the best stories are the simple ones.  And this one is simple, yet again.  These two simple, yet real characters, captivate the audience again with their genuine conversation that holds nothing back, and invites the audience to try and do the same.",5,Beautiful Sequel Extends the Realism and Genuine Feelings From the First Film,1179273600,"05 16, 2007",2007,2628,"['was', 'huge', 'fan', 'Before', 'Sunrise', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'loved', 'simplicity', 'realism', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'met', 'walking', 'around', 'beautiful', 'European', 'city', 'Vienna', 'getting', 'know', 'other.You', 'might', 'wonder', 'what', 'have', 'left', 'talk', 'film', 'tackled', 'so', 'many', 'subjects', 'previous', 'one', 'Believe', 'have', 'plenty', 'talk', 'wish', 'film', 'would', 'never', 'end.The', 'story', 'place', 'nine', 'years', 'previous', 'film', 'Jesse', 'now', 'successful', 'author', 'who', 'doing', 'book', 'tour', 'Europe', 'Paris', 'last', 'stop', 'sitting', 'small', 'book', 'shop', 'answering', 'questions', 'readers', 'when', 'shoulder', 'sees', 'Celine', 'standing', 'there', 'film', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'spend', 'few', 'precious', 'hours', 'together', 'Jesse', 'must', 'be', 'airport', 'make', 'flight.Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Jesse', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'Celine', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'director', 'obvious', 'two', 'actors', 'know', 'characters', 'so', 'well', ""'m"", 'sure', 'even', 'had', 'spent', 'nine', 'years', 'wondering', 'how', 'would', 'end', 'Does', 'Jesse', 'come', 'back', 'six-month-later', 'reunion', 'Does', 'Celine', 'Do', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'live', 'so', 'far', 'away', 'able', 'keep', 'what', 'be', 'unlikely', 'promise', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'relate', 'anything', 'else', 'story', 'here', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'yet', 'film', 'where', 'thrill', 'journey', 'not', 'goal', 'step', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'make', 'walk', 'Paris', 'step', 'journey.I', 'recall', 'telling', 'friends', 'first', 'film', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'movie', 'two', 'people', 'walking', 'around', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'just', 'first', 'film', 'conversations', 'are', 'so', 'real', 'enthralling', 'think', 'part', 'reason', 'so', 'compelling', 'when', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'together', 'are', 'fakery', 'need', 'put', 'face', 'order', 'impress', 'other', 'Perhaps', 'are', 'time', 'crunch', 'figure', 'need', 'be', 'anything', 'other', 'genuine', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'other', 'again', 'powerful', 'scene', 'film', 'recognition', 'tribute', 'genuiness', 'why', 'feel', 'more', 'comfortable', 'other', 'anyone', 'else', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'with.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'said', 'best', 'stories', 'are', 'simple', 'ones', 'one', 'simple', 'yet', 'again', 'two', 'simple', 'yet', 'real', 'characters', 'captivate', 'audience', 'again', 'genuine', 'conversation', 'nothing', 'back', 'audience', 'try', 'do', 'same']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)

They are filled with characters you do not believe in facing situations that would never happen in a million years. That's why it's so refreshing to see such a sweet, touching, realistic and simple movie like Before Sunset.Following its first installment, Before Sunrise, Sunset picks up 10 years lafter that movie ended. These two characters, who had promised to meet each other at the end of Sunrise, never did actually follow through with their plans. Now Hawke has become a writer and is touring France. And Delpy just happens to go to one of his singings.Love is still in the air and the characters decide to spend whatever's left of the day together (Hawke is schedule to return to America that very evening). As in Sunrise, they talk aobut nothing and everything; their dreams, regrets, their new lives... It seems that, although both of them have trudged along through the years, their lives have been incomplete without the other. Set in real time, we get to see the denouement of all those years of build-up sadness finally come to the surface.The film offers a surprise ending that is actually quite fitting for this film. Hawke and Delpy deliver the strongest performances of their careers; they look at ease and comfortable playing these characters. You just end up believing that they ARE these characters.Linklater knows how to develop characters and plot, and Before Sunset just comes to show the kind of magician that he is; there isn't a dull moment in Before Sunset.

He's living a farce of a marriage, she seems numb to her erstwhile buoyant mien. Once again, we get a healthy dose of casual-on-the-surface conversation that seems determined to breathe in its own space and spew pearls of wisdom such as ""Memory is a wonderful thing if you don't have to deal with the past"".As the minutes tick by before he catches his plane, so do the confessions, building to a do-they-or-don't-they crescendo.  Teasingly frustrating in its ambiguity, the final scene -&#8212; facile, heady, sexy as Lycra -&#8212; avoids a conventionally neat conclusion, instead tantalizing us with yet more questions. As Delphie's character herself mentions during the chitchat, such a denouement could mean different things to different people depending on whether one's a romantic optimist or a presumptuous cynic.If you ask me, it works superbly. Though the film has much more going for it. There're some stunning acting sequences with uninterrupted takes for minutes on end. There's that familiar, delectable brand of wit that'll keep you glued. There's even an acoustic guitar performance at the end by Delphie herself, and my, what a breathtaking moment that is.I hope they make a Before Next Sunrise 10 years from now, and a Before Next Sunset 20 years hence.

However, Richard Linklater's ""Beyond Sunset"" is the exception.  It is a beautiful bookend film that intensifies the emotional impact of its predecessor.Nine years after parting ways, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) meet in a Paris bookstore.  Their planned reunion in Vienna never came to pass and now the two of them reflect on the different paths their lives have taken since their short time together.  Soon to be separated again, Jesse and Celine make their way through the city and wonder if they were truly meant to be with each other.First off, for those of you who are wondering whether you should view ""Before Sunrise"" (1995) before watching ""Before Sunset,"" the answer is a resounding ""yes.""  Skipping the first film will dilute much of the magic of the second.  Perhaps the most impressive aspect of ""Before Sunset"" is that it proves beyond all doubt that a minimalist work can be just as entertaining as a Hollywood blockbuster.  This film is driven mainly by its dialogue which is so well-written that you do not mind that there no car chases, dance numbers, or big explosions filling in the time between the couple's discussions.  Hawke and Delpy have a wonderful chemistry that is even more enchanting the second time around.

We learn that the night Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) spent wandering around Vienna nine years earlier was the defining experience of the rest of their lives, and that they have, essentially, spent the intervening period thinking of almost nothing but each other.  Jesse is now trapped in a loveless marriage, of which the only enjoyment he has is the time he spends with his four-year-old son.  Celine has gone from one unsatisfying relationship to another, each similar in that her partners marry someone else right after breaking up with her, and the only reason  she can stand to be with her current partner, who she clearly doesn't like very much, is because he is a war photographer who is overseas almost all the time.Again, Jesse has a plane to catch and must leave, and at the last minute, he decides to miss the plane and stay with Celine.  This didn't ring true for me - maybe he could leave his wife in that cruel way, but how could he abandon his son?  A better ending would have had him say goodbye to Celine again, right before meeting his family at the hotel.  This time, they exchange addresses and phone numbers, and promise to stay in touch.  But the director evidently had other plans for them.Many years ago, in a job-related training class, I met a woman who worked for my organization in another part of the country.  We experienced  that amazing connection that two people can have, and were inseparable while the class was going on.  At the end, we said goodbye and did not stay in contact.  Suffice it to say that on some level, we both recognized that in the real world, outside the carefree and artificial class environment, we didn't have enough in common to build a life together.  Neither of our families would have approved, in any case.Twenty years later, we met at another training class.  In the intervening time, we had both married and raised families.  We picked up our conversation almost as if no time had passed.  It was remarkable.  And if anyone is wondering, we didn't have sex, or even kiss each other, despite the fact that we both still found each other attractive.  This is how mature people handle this kind of thing - you can't go around doing whatever makes you feel good.  You have to be responsible to the people around you, with whom you share your life.  I haven't seen the third installment of this series, but I understand that Jesse and Celine get married and make each other truly miserable.

851310,A3KKPVZ2EQQLAB,B0002YLC24,The archduke,"[2, 3]","There was alot of hype leading up to the release of this film, and with good reason. The original movie, &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; has achieved the status of being a cult favorite among movie goers, and many were leary about what would take place in a sequel. So many questions were left unanswered with the first flim: would Jesse and Celine ever meet up six months later in Vienna? Would they be able to move on with their lives after their one incredible evening together? Many people, myself inculded, were somewhat afraid to find out these answers, instead preferring to let our imagination run away with us.But I give major credit to Richard Linklater, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, who all three cowrote this movie. They know what works, and they knew how to answer all the questions that were important to the fans, and I have to admit that I would not change one thing about this film.This one is now set in Paris, nine years after the initial meeting in Vienna. Jesse is now on a book tour, a book which is of course about his night with Celine. She meets him in a Paris bookstore, where he is being interviewed, and they embark on a real time one and a half hour catch up session before he must go to the airport and back to America.  Their dialogue with one another is as though they never left each other, which in a way is very satisfying to see. The conversation relates to things they have talked about before, venturing into the philosophical issues of life, and the half written, half improvised script is very realistic, and very satisfying.As much as I want to, I will not spill the secrets of this film, as they must be seen to be fully understood. What &quot;Before Sunset&quot; is is a brilliantly romantic movie about holding on to one's past, trying to keep heading for the future, and wondering what could have been. Everything here is perfect, and this needs to be considered one of the best movies of the year, without question. It is simple, quick and it gets to all the things we have wanted to know about for the last nine years. I also found that this movie had a very good ending, revealing just enough and leaving enough to the imagination to appease all viewers. This truly is a great film. For those fans of &quot;Before Sunrise&quot;, this is an absolute must see, and Jesse and Celine should be considered some of the great romantic characters of all time.",5,Simply put: Brilliant,1109808000,"03 3, 2005",2005,2394,"['was', 'alot', 'hype', 'leading', 'up', 'release', 'film', 'good', 'reason', 'original', 'movie', 'quot', 'Sunrise', 'quot', 'achieved', 'status', 'being', 'cult', 'favorite', 'movie', 'goers', 'many', 'were', 'leary', 'what', 'would', 'take', 'place', 'sequel', 'So', 'many', 'questions', 'were', 'left', 'unanswered', 'first', 'flim', 'would', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'ever', 'meet', 'up', 'six', 'months', 'later', 'Vienna', 'Would', 'be', 'able', 'move', 'lives', 'one', 'incredible', 'evening', 'together', 'Many', 'people', 'inculded', 'were', 'somewhat', 'afraid', 'find', 'out', 'answers', 'instead', 'preferring', 'let', 'imagination', 'run', 'away', 'us.But', 'give', 'major', 'credit', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'who', 'three', 'cowrote', 'movie', 'know', 'what', 'knew', 'how', 'answer', 'questions', 'were', 'important', 'fans', 'have', 'admit', 'would', 'not', 'change', 'one', 'thing', 'film.This', 'one', 'now', 'set', 'Paris', 'nine', 'years', 'initial', 'meeting', 'Vienna', 'Jesse', 'now', 'book', 'tour', 'book', 'course', 'night', 'Celine', 'Paris', 'bookstore', 'where', 'being', 'interviewed', 'embark', 'real', 'time', 'one', 'half', 'hour', 'catch', 'up', 'session', 'must', 'go', 'airport', 'back', 'America', 'dialogue', 'one', 'never', 'left', 'other', 'way', 'very', 'satisfying', 'see', 'conversation', 'things', 'have', 'talked', 'before', 'venturing', 'philosophical', 'issues', 'life', 'half', 'written', 'half', 'improvised', 'script', 'very', 'realistic', 'very', 'satisfying.As', 'much', 'want', 'will', 'not', 'spill', 'secrets', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'fully', 'understood', 'What', 'quot', 'Sunset', 'quot', 'brilliantly', 'romantic', 'movie', 'holding', 'one', 'past', 'trying', 'keep', 'heading', 'future', 'wondering', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Everything', 'here', 'perfect', 'be', 'considered', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'year', 'question', 'simple', 'quick', 'things', 'have', 'wanted', 'know', 'last', 'nine', 'years', 'also', 'found', 'movie', 'had', 'very', 'good', 'ending', 'revealing', 'just', 'enough', 'leaving', 'enough', 'imagination', 'appease', 'viewers', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'fans', 'quot', 'Before', 'Sunrise', 'quot', 'absolute', 'must', 'see', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'great', 'romantic', 'characters', 'time']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)

851312,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B0002YLC24,Tom Birkenstock,"[2, 3]","In the song, ""Periodically Double or Triple lead singer of Yo La Tengo, Ira Kaplan, opens with the line, ""I've never read Proust/Seems a little too long.""  In this bit of understatement, Kaplan touches upon the sacrifices of time.  We only have so many years, so we must make certain decisions about what we will and will not do to fill up those years.  It's no coincidence that Proust himself was concerned with the paradoxes of time.  The past, in Proust's work, is always in a dialectic relationship with the present--that is, it never leaves us and it is always filtered through the now.  Of course, I've never actually read Proust.  As Kaplan suggested, it seems pretty long.  I've made the decision that, at least up until now, I don't want to invest my time in Proust.  And yet, at the same time I would genuinely feel sorry for someone who hasn't read The Great Gatsby, Catch-22, The Sound and the Fury, Slaughterhouse Five, Moby Dick, The Sun Also Rises, along with a whole host of other classics before his or her time is up.  So we all must make choices.I bring all of this up because the movie Before Sunset is all about the passage of time and how the choices we make preclude certain avenues in our lives.  Taking place nine years after the events of Before Sunrise, Sunset reunites Jessie and Celine, two young lovers who had spent a single night together in Vienna before vanishing from each others' lives.  Jessie has written a book, the plot of which suspiciously echoes the events of Vienna, and because his press tour takes him through Paris, he has one more chance to walk around a beautiful European city conversing with Celine about life, the universe, and everything.  But this time there's even more of a time constraint.  Jessie has to leave in an hour and a half if he wants to catch his plane.  The choice to limit the amount of time Jessie and Celine spend together and to shoot the film in real time only further stresses the finite nature of the moment and the importance of the decisions we make.Naturally, nine years have changed Jessie and Celine.  Jessie finds himself in a damaged marriage with a son whom he adores but a wife whom he never really loved.  Celine works in an environmental non-profit, but she has never fully committed to any single relationship over the years.  In many ways these two characters are immensely successful for their age.  Celine might still worry about the state of the world, but she works for a company that makes real changes.  Jessie has published a book that is potentially successful enough to warrant a promotional engagement at Shakespeare and Company.  And yet in their personal life they've found a nearly inexplicable lack.  The question, of course, is if they hadn't parted nine years ago, would they feel this way?At one point, Celine says, ""Memory is a wonderful thing if you don't have to deal with the past.""  There's a sense throughout the film that both Jessie and Celine have romanticized their night together as a means of avoiding their present day problems.  Their night in Vienna has become, in its own peculiar way, preserved in amber, and any relationship since then has to compete with that refraction of a memory.  This dialogue with the past occurs throughout the film, and I myself had a similar situation watching this film.  When first watching it many years ago, I thought the movie was about how people become disillusioned as they get older, but upon multiple viewings since, I now think it's about how questions of what could have been can seem like an escape pod for whatever presses upon us in the now.  Even Celine claims, ""Maybe we would have hated each other eventually.""  Celine and Jessie want the relationship they had nine years ago, but they don't want to necessarily put in the work.  In fact, over the years the characters have become more romantic.  In the first film, they had to fight against their 90s cynicism, but here they are more open to the possibilities that finding the right person can fix what's wrong with their world.The principle characters involved with this film have really done the impossible.  They have made a sequel that is arguably deeper than the original (and I say this as someone who whole heartedly loves the original).  But what's more, Sunset complicates its predecessor.  Hollywood cinema is filled with movies about couples who meet, overcome obstacles and fall deeply in love.  But no one, it seems, wants to engage with the long term consequences of monogamy.  Sunset only touches upon some of these issues (which they will hopefully get to in the third chapter), but it does present us with something that's incredibly rare in American cinema: two likable, engaging people genuinely dealing with growing older and understanding the impact of life's choices.",5,Time and the Choices We Make,1372032000,"06 24, 2013",2013,4809,"['song', 'Periodically', 'Double', 'Triple', 'lead', 'singer', 'Yo', 'La', 'Tengo', 'Ira', 'Kaplan', 'line', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'bit', 'understatement', 'Kaplan', 'sacrifices', 'time', 'only', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'must', 'make', 'certain', 'decisions', 'what', 'will', 'will', 'not', 'do', 'fill', 'up', 'years', 'coincidence', 'Proust', 'was', 'concerned', 'paradoxes', 'time', 'past', 'Proust', 'work', 'always', 'dialectic', 'relationship', 'present', 'never', 'always', 'filtered', 'now', 'course', ""'ve"", 'never', 'actually', 'read', 'Proust', 'Kaplan', 'suggested', 'pretty', 'long', ""'ve"", 'made', 'decision', 'least', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'invest', 'time', 'Proust', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'would', 'genuinely', 'feel', 'sorry', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'read', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'Catch-22', 'Sound', 'Fury', 'Slaughterhouse', 'Five', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'Sun', 'Also', 'whole', 'host', 'other', 'classics', 'time', 'up', 'must', 'make', 'choices.I', 'bring', 'up', 'movie', 'Sunset', 'passage', 'time', 'how', 'choices', 'make', 'preclude', 'certain', 'avenues', 'lives', 'Taking', 'place', 'nine', 'years', 'events', 'Before', 'Sunrise', 'Sunset', 'Jessie', 'Celine', 'two', 'young', 'lovers', 'who', 'had', 'spent', 'single', 'night', 'together', 'Vienna', 'vanishing', 'others', 'lives', 'Jessie', 'written', 'book', 'plot', 'suspiciously', 'events', 'Vienna', 'press', 'tour', 'Paris', 'one', 'more', 'chance', 'walk', 'beautiful', 'European', 'city', 'conversing', 'Celine', 'life', 'universe', 'everything', 'time', 'even', 'more', 'time', 'constraint', 'Jessie', 'leave', 'hour', 'half', 'catch', 'plane', 'choice', 'limit', 'amount', 'time', 'Jessie', 'Celine', 'spend', 'together', 'shoot', 'film', 'real', 'time', 'only', 'further', 'finite', 'nature', 'moment', 'importance', 'decisions', 'make.Naturally', 'nine', 'years', 'have', 'changed', 'Jessie', 'Celine', 'Jessie', 'damaged', 'marriage', 'son', 'whom', 'wife', 'whom', 'never', 'really', 'loved', 'Celine', 'environmental', 'non-profit', 'never', 'fully', 'committed', 'single', 'relationship', 'years', 'many', 'ways', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'immensely', 'successful', 'age', 'Celine', 'might', 'still', 'worry', 'state', 'world', 'company', 'real', 'changes', 'Jessie', 'published', 'book', 'potentially', 'successful', 'enough', 'warrant', 'promotional', 'engagement', 'Shakespeare', 'Company', 'yet', 'personal', 'life', ""'ve"", 'found', 'nearly', 'inexplicable', 'lack', 'question', 'course', 'had', ""n't"", 'parted', 'nine', 'years', 'ago', 'would', 'feel', 'way', 'one', 'point', 'Celine', 'Memory', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'deal', 'past', 'sense', 'film', 'Jessie', 'Celine', 'have', 'romanticized', 'night', 'together', 'means', 'avoiding', 'present', 'day', 'problems', 'night', 'Vienna', 'become', 'own', 'peculiar', 'way', 'preserved', 'amber', 'relationship', 'then', 'compete', 'refraction', 'memory', 'dialogue', 'past', 'occurs', 'film', 'had', 'similar', 'situation', 'watching', 'film', 'When', 'first', 'watching', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'how', 'people', 'become', 'disillusioned', 'get', 'older', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'now', 'think', 'how', 'questions', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'can', 'seem', 'escape', 'pod', 'presses', 'upon', 'now', 'Even', 'Celine', 'claims', 'Maybe', 'would', 'have', 'hated', 'other', 'eventually', 'Celine', 'Jessie', 'want', 'relationship', 'had', 'nine', 'years', 'ago', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'necessarily', 'put', 'work', 'fact', 'years', 'characters', 'have', 'become', 'more', 'romantic', 'first', 'film', 'had', 'fight', '90s', 'cynicism', 'here', 'are', 'more', 'open', 'possibilities', 'finding', 'right', 'person', 'can', 'fix', 'what', 'wrong', 'world.The', 'principle', 'characters', 'involved', 'film', 'have', 'really', 'done', 'impossible', 'have', 'made', 'sequel', 'arguably', 'deeper', 'original', 'say', 'someone', 'who', 'whole', 'heartedly', 'original', 'what', 'more', 'Sunset', 'predecessor', 'Hollywood', 'cinema', 'filled', 'movies', 'couples', 'who', 'meet', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'fall', 'deeply', 'love', 'one', 'engage', 'long', 'term', 'consequences', 'monogamy', 'Sunset', 'only', 'issues', 'will', 'hopefully', 'get', 'third', 'chapter', 'present', 'something', 'incredibly', 'rare', 'American', 'cinema', 'two', 'likable', 'engaging', 'people', 'genuinely', 'dealing', 'growing', 'older', 'understanding', 'impact', 'life', 'choices']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)
851313,A2NVQZ4Y7Y0J1R,B0002YLC24,Traveler,"[8, 13]","""Before Sunset"" picks up ten years later after ""Before Sunrise.""  Many of us already know these characters.  We know what's at stake between them, to a degree . . . although some of that we learn as ""Sunset"" takes us to its conclusion.  Whereas ""Sunrise"" was about impulsive young love, ""Sunset"" is about lost chances, remorse, and holding on to that last thread of hope.For all these reasons and more ""Sunset"" is the better film.  It's more tightly woven than the first and we know pretty early on what our number one question is - will they finally get together as a couple?  (Despite what the film's critics argue, the answer is fairly obvious in the last few seconds.)The film dances around the edges of intimacy at the beginning - just like it would happen in real life.  The characters chat about life, politics, career, philosophy.  Only when time ticks away and both realize what they are about to lose, once again, do they begin to turn to their inner most thoughts and desires.It's a bit disheartening to see the reviews of films such as ""The Notebook"" which are sappy, poorly acted and unrealistic compared to ""Before Sunset"" which so clearly shows a level of love, realism and attention to detail.I also have to disagree with those who have stated that this film is ""anti-American.""  Poll after poll has shown that the majority of people on the planet, including the industrialized world, oppose US foreign policy.  You can dislike that fact if you want. However, it would ludicrous to suggest that a European would not be critical of the US.  Still, the French government is no better and have committed horrendous acts of their own.  So I would argue that Delphy's character, while perhaps realistic, is either naive or a bit nationalistic herself for not bashing her own government, not just the US.  But all of this is besides the point . . .""Before Sunset,"" like it's prequel, will likely stand the test of time in the world of cinema.  It's romantic, thought provoking and ground breaking. It's one of those films like ""Memento"" that others will only be able to copy",5,Better than the 1st.

851314,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0002YLC24,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","Many reviewers seem to have already said what I wanted to say, but still I want to add my words about hits enchanting little film about love and life. You can think of lots of words to describe the merits of ""Before Sunset"" - charming, sweet, poignant and beautiful - in other words, the film is very realistic in showing how people meet and love each other.Nine years after ""Before Sunrise"" in which Celine (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) spent fourteen hours together in Vienna, they meet again in Paris, but Jesse must leave the city for the airport much sooner than before. During the short time, Jesse and Celine talk about what happened to them since the ending of the previous film.The premise is simple, but the resonant story is honest and becomes deeply emotional as it goes on, much deeper if you fondly remember the original film ""Before Sunrise"" made in 1994. Its sequel ""Before Sunset"" reflects the lapse of nine years, and how these two likable characters have grown up. Like ""Beofe Sunrise,"" ""Before Sunset"" is filled with dialogues, but the new film is more focused and compact, as if reflecting that they (and director Richard Linklater) really became more mature during the nine years.Probably they did. The conversations exchanged between Jesse and Celine are most thought-provoking when they talk about how coincidences can influence our lives - what if Celine's grandmother didn't die, for instance? Many episodes of their lives since their brief encounter in Vienna are charmingly recounted by two actors who are really in character, but the film is most emotionally touching when they (and we) realise their sweet memories could become very poignant with the ""what if"" scenarios that might have been.You don't have to see ""Before Sunrise"" to appreciate the charms of ""Before Sunset,"" but viewing experiences will surely enhance the feeling that you also have grown up like Jesse and Celine. The sequel reveals us not only what happened to them since then; it also playfully gives us clues as to the night they spent together - in short did they make love?I can keep writing about the good things about the film, its Paris locations, beautiful but not of postcard beauty (including the bookshop Shakespeare & Company and the brief boat trip on the Seine) and its sparse but lovely music (songs by Nina Simone and Julie Delpy herself) but I was most moved by the film's outlook on life, optimistic without losing sight of sadness.",5,Lovely and Charming and a Little Bit of Sadness,1173225600,"03 7, 2007",2007,2458,"['Many', 'reviewers', 'seem', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'what', 'wanted', 'say', 'still', 'want', 'add', 'words', 'hits', 'enchanting', 'little', 'film', 'love', 'life', 'can', 'think', 'lots', 'words', 'describe', 'merits', 'Sunset', 'charming', 'sweet', 'poignant', 'beautiful', 'other', 'words', 'film', 'very', 'realistic', 'showing', 'how', 'people', 'meet', 'love', 'other.Nine', 'years', 'Sunrise', 'Celine', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'Jesse', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'spent', 'fourteen', 'hours', 'together', 'Vienna', 'meet', 'again', 'Paris', 'Jesse', 'must', 'leave', 'city', 'airport', 'much', 'sooner', 'before', 'short', 'time', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'talk', 'what', 'happened', 'ending', 'previous', 'film.The', 'premise', 'simple', 'resonant', 'story', 'honest', 'deeply', 'emotional', 'much', 'deeper', 'fondly', 'remember', 'original', 'film', 'Sunrise', 'made', '1994', 'sequel', 'Sunset', 'lapse', 'nine', 'years', 'how', 'two', 'likable', 'characters', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'Beofe', 'Sunrise', 'Sunset', 'filled', 'dialogues', 'new', 'film', 'more', 'focused', 'compact', 'reflecting', 'director', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'really', 'became', 'more', 'mature', 'nine', 'years.Probably', 'did', 'conversations', 'exchanged', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'are', 'most', 'thought-provoking', 'when', 'talk', 'how', 'coincidences', 'can', 'influence', 'lives', 'what', 'Celine', 'grandmother', 'did', ""n't"", 'die', 'instance', 'Many', 'episodes', 'lives', 'brief', 'encounter', 'Vienna', 'are', 'charmingly', 'recounted', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'character', 'film', 'most', 'emotionally', 'touching', 'when', 'realise', 'sweet', 'memories', 'could', 'become', 'very', 'poignant', 'what', 'scenarios', 'might', 'have', 'been.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'see', 'Sunrise', 'appreciate', 'charms', 'Sunset', 'viewing', 'experiences', 'will', 'surely', 'enhance', 'feeling', 'also', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'sequel', 'reveals', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'happened', 'then', 'also', 'playfully', 'clues', 'night', 'spent', 'together', 'short', 'did', 'make', 'love', 'can', 'keep', 'writing', 'good', 'things', 'film', 'Paris', 'locations', 'beautiful', 'not', 'postcard', 'beauty', 'including', 'bookshop', 'Shakespeare', 'Company', 'brief', 'boat', 'trip', 'Seine', 'sparse', 'lovely', 'music', 'songs', 'Nina', 'Simone', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'was', 'most', 'moved', 'film', 'outlook', 'life', 'optimistic', 'losing', 'sight', 'sadness']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)
851315,A38TC59GM2WW1X,B0002YLC24,"Victor Chen ""Messerschmitts""","[18, 21]","I just came back from the theatres after watching ""Before Sunset"" and OMG, my mind is officially blown.  I went in with high expectations, and all of them were met, then some.First of all I've always been a huge fan of ""Before Sunrise"", considering it to be the best romantic movie in history.  That said, I'm delighted to announce that ""Before Sunset"" is a sequel completely worthy of its matchless predecessor.  I think I speak for all fans of ""Before Sunrise"" that we never expected to see a sequel, and that this movie is a dream come true.Everything that made the first movie so great is duplicated here, but in a fresh and engaging way.  Star-crossed but estranged lovers Jesse and Celine are reunited after 9 years in Paris, and we are invited to follow them along in a voyueristic, real-time conversation for a little more than an hour.  Like the first movie, Before Sunset is really just one long conversation.  If that sounds boring, don't be fooled.  Director Linklater knows his stuff; this is his way of doing thangs, and he does it well.  It's perhaps a big artistic gamble, but it works, just as it did for the first movie.The conversation begins somewhat mundane and chit-chatty, but it only adds to the realism, and gradually builds in crescendo as Jesse and Celine slowly reveal to each other what they REALLY want to say, yet are afraid to.  There were really very few dull moments as the conversation is richly layered with multiple dimensions of meaning encoded in what is said, not said, and subtle body language.  We find out that after all these years, Celine and Jesse are still very much in love with each other, and both are frustrated by both the past misfortunes that prevented their originally planned reunion in Vienna, and the unfortunate circumstance that makes their current reunion highly problematic.  Yet all this is skilfully and subtly conveyed, and we are not beaten over the head with it, as a lesser director may have been tempted to do.  The car-ride scene towards the end when Celine reveals her sadness and misery that Jesse is now married with kids was done brilliantly and with heart-breaking poignancy.  Equally poignant was Jesse's ""retort"", revealing his recurring dream of the French girl he could never forget.Both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy make wonderful performances in this movie and have rich, kinetic chemistry with each other.  We really believe that they are in love.  However, I am a guy, so most of my attention was upon the certifiably radiant and gorgeous Julie Delpy.  Delpy/Celine is any guy's dream girl.  Smart, funny, insecure yet independent, and genuinely adorable. Her beauty is a down-to-Earth kind glowing with infinite softness and femininity.  Plus there's the light but irresistible French accent thing going.  I fell in love with her in the first film.  After the second film I can barely endure the sweet misery.  Hawke does a fine job too, creating a character I truly like and identify with.  We see the difference between Jesse's idealistic romanticism and Celine's cautious cynacism, yet we also see the undeniable link between them that is the source of their love.Jesse has only about an hour to spend with Celine before his flight leaves, and as the film progresses both the audience and the characters feel the rising dread of the inevitable.  Once again, everything is done with minimalist, artful grace.  But we see and understand nevertheless with crystal clarity what is going on in Jesse's mind as he desperately attempts to squeeze out every possible extra precious second he can with Celine.  We are on the edge of our seats biting our nails as the end nears, the tension of the unsaid hanging over us and Jesse like a dark menace.  What will Jesse do?  Will he abandone his (albeit dysfunctional) marriage and be with Celine?  Will he get on that flight back to New York?  What makes the audience so enthralled is that not only do we not know what is going to happen, it's obvious that neither does Jesse.  Jesse is right there with us in real time, the battle of desire vs. obligation raging in his mind.  He tries so desperately to buy more time, perhaps to decide, or perhaps just to see what he is going to do, as if watching his own actions unfold outside of himself.The ending of ""Before Sunrise"" was brilliant and unforgettable, but ultimately poignant and ended on a ""downer"" tone.  I know that it was supposed to be an ambiguous ending in which cynics know they never met at the appointed place, and romantics believed they did.  But Celine's little sad chuckle to herself at the end of the film seemed a very clear indication, at least to me, that they never kept their promise.  That said, the ending of Before Sunset was utterly sublime and genius, one of the most satisfying conclusions to a movie I have ever seen.  It is technically ambiguous (keeping a coherent style with the first movie), but it appears to me to be obvious that the romantics win!!!  Ha ha true, you may choose to interpret it another way, but to me the tone was quite different from the ending of the first movie, this one being an undeniable ""upper"".  Ironic then, that in the first movie Jesse and Celine (apparently) have sex twice whereas in this one they don't even kiss.  I was clapping hard and screaming after the ending.  It completely satiated me.  And if Richard Linklater is reading this review, I'd like to first thank him so much for making such a peerless duo of films, and secondly I must demand that he NEVER MAKE A THIRD INSTALLMENT!!!  Don't you DARE make a ""Before Sun[blank]""!!!  Celine+Jesse forever!!!  DO NOT MAKE ANOTHER one of the series, unless you are going to show Celine and Jesse happily married in Paris with Celine pregnant lying in Jesse's bed.  If they didn't end up together I don't want to hear about it!  I like the ending to this one and I am satisfied with my interpretation!The only weakness of ""Before Sunset"" is that I don't really think it works if you didn't see the first movie.  This is especially problematic since the first movie, although an excellent cult favourite, was not widely seen by audiences.  Yes, even if you've never seen Before Sunrise, you will enjoy this movie.  However I estimate that something around 60% of Before Sunset's emotional impact will be lost, as well as references to events in the first movie.  In fact the two are so inseparable in a storyline perspective that I now see them as one long movie (or conversation).  Thus, if you're going to see Before Sunset in theatres (and I HIGHLY recommend that you do), why don't you give yourself the full experience and rent ""Before Sunrise"" beforehand?  There has never been a better excuse ;-)",5,Beyond Words;  this may be the best sequel I've ever seen,1088985600,"07 5, 2004",2004,6698,"['just', 'came', 'back', 'theatres', 'watching', 'Sunset',

Marshall,"[3, 4]","This film is the perfect love story adding to ""Before Sunrise"" filmed in 1994 it takes us through the awkwardness of a love so passionately unrequited.In 1994 a little film was made entitled ""Before Sunrise"" and we met an awkward American boy named Jesse (Ethan Hawke) as he encountered a beautiful exuberant French girl named Celine (Julie Delpy). The original movie took us on a visual journey through Europe starting on a Eurorail and ending with the sunrise in Vienna. The couple agreed to meet in the same place and we were left to wonder what ever happened to this engaging couple and their great banter. Well finally the answer can be found in this updated conversation between Jesse and Celine in of all places, the most romantic city in the world, Paris! Jesse, now a writer, is surprised by Celine during his book signing in Paris. Celine has become an ""angry activist"" and she still holds a definite opinion about everything under the sun making for yet another fabulous tte-&agrave;-tte. We follow Celine and Jesse through the streets of Paris, sipping coffee at caf&eacute;s, strolling along the Seine and passing through gardens of excellence, eventually ending up at Celine's Parisian apartment.....will it ever end? I for one hope not!Expect nothing short of brilliance from this simple and straight forward film about a couple re-kindling a flame not ready to die. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy maintain a fantastic rhythm throughout this film walking through Paris while having a most interesting conversation. Despite its simplicity in actuality the writing is quite sophisticated and now very grown-up. All of the passion and chemistry from the first film remains between the characters here and I imagine a third film will be on the back burner. All of the great romances always end in Paris but we are left again to wonder if Jesse and Celine will really make it after all.

Actually I was a little worried during the scenes taking place in the cafe. Poor Ethan Hawke's character was on the verge of letting his romantic interest be subverted by Celine's need to talk about her boyfriend problems, turning Jesse into a ""GOOD LISTENER"" - making him a ""friend"", i.e. dead to rights in the romance department. Luckily for our pair, he corrects himself. Actually, for those wanting more of these two, a PERFECT ""epilogue"" of sorts, can be found on Linklater's earlier effort, ""Waking Life"".

851320,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B0002YLC24,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[2, 2]","I rented Before Sunrise just one week before I saw Before Sunset in the theater. I was so glad that I didn't see the prequel 9 years ago, otherwise it would've been a long wait for the Sunset. I'd enjoyed Sunrise very much, because it was a trully original romantic movie without the formulas and big sets used by Julia Roberts, Meg Ryan, and Reese Witherspoon. It was a beautiful story about love at first sight. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy gave very natural performances as if they were ""living"" in this movie.There were many funny and touching moments filled with introspective dialogues that worked perfectly for this documentary-style film. I've never quite enjoyed Ethan Hawke until Before Sunrise. He was funny and charming, which was very different from his action roles. Julie Delpy may not have been the most memorable star of Three Colours: Blue(Juliette Binoche), Red(Irene Jacobs), and White(Julie Delpy), because Zbigniew Zamachowski stole the movie. Before Sunrise was the perfect vehicle for her to play a young French woman who is sexy, naive, and vulnerable. She carried through the film with a flawless performance.Sunrise left me wondering what would happen to Jesse(Ethan Hawke) and Celine(Julie Delpy). Did they see each other again after 6 months when they departed at the train station?In Before Sunset, Celine showed up at the book store in Paris where Jesse was doing a promotion for his novel that was based on his half-day experience with a French girl in Vienna 9 years ago. They went for coffee, a walk on the streets of Paris, and a boat ride on the river. They had some serious catching up to do before they had to say goodbye at Sunset. Jesse was very disappointed that Celine didn't showed up on their second date, because her grandmother died that week. unfortunately, they never reconnected again, because they didn't have each other's number. Even though Celine had lived in New York for a year, they never ran into each other. Jesse got married and has a son, but for years he never stopped thinking about Celine. As for Celine, she had her share of bad boyfriends over the years, and she regretted for not going to meet Jesse.It was very eomotionally impacting to see Celine on the verge of crying when she was riding in the car with Jesse. They both wanted each other so badly, and wished they could have another chance. It was amazing to see Hawke and Delpy delivering intense dialogues that was 5-10 minutes long in one take. The whole movie was shot in real time, so it fell like I was following them for 80 minutes throughout the movie.Celine invited Jesse back to her place for tea. She sang him a song that had his name in it, and did her little Nina Simone impersonation while she was making the tea. Jesse smiled with amusement and deep down he was wondering when they'll be together again. And I wonder if they'll be another episode to this unfinished love story.",5,Julie Delpy gets emotional with Ethan Hawke.,1099958400,"11 9, 2004",2004,2912,"['rented', 'Sunrise', 'just', 'one', 'week', 'saw', 'Sunset', 'theater', 'was', 'so', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'prequel', '9', 'years', 'ago', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'long', 'wait', 'Sunset', ""'d"", 'enjoyed', 'Sunrise', 'very', 'much', 'was', 'trully', 'original', 'romantic', 'movie', 'formulas', 'big', 'sets', 'used', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'was', 'beautiful', 'story', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'gave', 'very', 'natural', 'performances', 'were', 'living', 'were', 'many', 'funny', 'touching', 'moments', 'filled', 'introspective', 'dialogues', 'worked', 'perfectly', 'documentary-style', 'film', ""'ve"", 'never', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Before', 'Sunrise', 'was', 'funny', 'charming', 'was', 'very', 'different', 'action', 'roles', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'memorable', 'star', 'Three', 'Colours', 'Blue', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'Red', 'Irene', 'Jacobs', 'White', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'Zbigniew', 'Zamachowski', 'stole', 'movie', 'Sunrise', 'was', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'play', 'young', 'French', 'woman', 'who', 'sexy', 'naive', 'vulnerable', 'carried', 'film', 'flawless', 'performance.Sunrise', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'Jesse', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Celine', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'Did', 'see', 'other', 'again', '6', 'months', 'when', 'departed', 'train', 'station', 'Before', 'Sunset', 'Celine', 'showed', 'up', 'book', 'store', 'Paris', 'where', 'Jesse', 'was', 'doing', 'promotion', 'novel', 'was', 'based', 'half-day', 'experience', 'French', 'girl', 'Vienna', '9', 'years', 'ago', 'went', 'coffee', 'walk', 'streets', 'Paris', 'boat', 'ride', 'river', 'had', 'serious', 'catching', 'up', 'do', 'had', 'say', 'goodbye', 'Sunset', 'Jesse', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'Celine', 'did', ""n't"", 'showed', 'up', 'second', 'date', 'grandmother', 'died', 'week', 'unfortunately', 'never', 'reconnected', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'number', 'Even', 'Celine', 'had', 'lived', 'New', 'York', 'year', 'never', 'ran', 'other', 'Jesse', 'got', 'married', 'son', 'years', 'never', 'stopped', 'thinking', 'Celine', 'Celine', 'had', 'share', 'bad', 'boyfriends', 'years', 'regretted', 'not', 'going', 'meet', 'Jesse.It', 'was', 'very', 'eomotionally', 'impacting', 'see', 'Celine', 'verge', 'crying', 'when', 'was', 'riding', 'car', 'Jesse', 'wanted', 'other', 'so', 'badly', 'wished', 'could', 'have', 'chance', 'was', 'amazing', 'see', 'Hawke', 'Delpy', 'delivering', 'intense', 'dialogues', 'was', '5-10', 'minutes', 'long', 'one', 'take', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'real', 'time', 'fell', 'was', 'following', '80', 'minutes', 'movie.Celine', 'invited', 'Jesse', 'back', 'place', 'tea', 'sang', 'song', 'had', 'name', 'did', 'little', 'Nina', 'Simone', 'impersonation', 'was', 'making', 'tea', 'Jesse', 'smiled', 'amusement', 'deep', 'was', 'wondering', 'when', ""'ll"", 'be', 'together', 'again', 'wonder', ""'ll"", 'be', 'episode', 'unfinished', 'love', 'story']",BEFORE SUNSET (WS) (DVD)
