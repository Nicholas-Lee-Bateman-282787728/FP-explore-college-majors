I saw the Liam Neeson version of Les Miserables years ago, but it doesn't come close to the depth and accuracy of this version in terms of plot or characterization.Jean Valjean is a man who, after stealing a loaf of bread for his poor family, is sentenced to prison. After making an escape, he tries to get help from a local priest. After stealing from the priest and sneaking out, Jean is forced to come back to the priest when he is spotted by a couple of police who suspect he had taken from the man. Rather than giving Jean up as a thief, the priest covers for Jean, and he is a free man. Given the second chance at freedom (and in one of the most moving parts of the film), Jean is grateful for the kindness offered to him by the priest, and now resolves to do good for the common people for his remaining days. Years later, Jean is a well-respected member of the community who upholds his promise to the priest, but a new inspector (Anthony Perkins), who was a prison guard years ago, remembers Jean's face and identifies him as the man who escaped. Inspector Javert, adamant in his philosophy that criminals should always pay consequences regardless of their circumstances, is obsessed with a duty to track down and put Jean away in prison.Over all, the direction of this film was exceptional, and there were some moving, powerful scenes. For instance, the director could have made the Inspector an overbearing villain, but didn't, probably because there is much more complexity to this character in the novel. In the same light, Jean has his own faults that he comes to terms with, and he's not just a ""cut and dry"" good man. The themes of redemption and forgiveness are really underscored in the scene with the priest and Jean after he's escaped, and then years later. The different philosophies of Jean and Inspector Javert come to light as the film progresses. The setting, costumes and mood of the film are very epic in nature and this parallels with Hugo's work magnificently. If there is one minor drawback, the film quality is a bit grainy at times. However, this does not detract from the viewing too much.To take an enormous novel and boil it down to two hours successfully is quite a feat. Over all, this was an impressive version of Hugo's classic.",4,Impressive version of Hugo's classic,1246579200,"07 3, 2009",2009,2520,"['made', 'TV', 'presentations', 'classics', 'can', 'come', 'out', 'top', 'inaccurate', 'simplistic', 'cheesy', '1978', 'British', 'production', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'quite', 'opposite', 'very', 'successful', 'rendition', 'Hugo', 'massive', 'novel', 'saw', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'version', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'years', 'ago', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'depth', 'accuracy', 'version', 'terms', 'plot', 'characterization.Jean', 'Valjean', 'man', 'who', 'stealing', 'loaf', 'bread', 'poor', 'family', 'sentenced', 'prison', 'making', 'escape', 'get', 'help', 'local', 'priest', 'stealing', 'priest', 'sneaking', 'out', 'Jean', 'forced', 'come', 'back', 'priest', 'when', 'spotted', 'couple', 'police', 'who', 'suspect', 'had', 'taken', 'man', 'Rather', 'giving', 'Jean', 'up', 'thief', 'priest', 'covers', 'Jean', 'free', 'man', 'Given', 'second', 'chance', 'freedom', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'parts', 'film', 'Jean', 'grateful', 'kindness', 'offered', 'priest', 'now', 'do', 'good', 'common', 'people', 'remaining', 'days', 'Years', 'later', 'Jean', 'well-respected', 'member', 'community', 'who', 'promise', 'priest', 'new', 'inspector', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'who', 'was', 'prison', 'guard', 'years', 'ago', 'remembers', 'Jean', 'face', 'man', 'who', 'escaped', 'Inspector', 'Javert', 'adamant', 'philosophy', 'criminals', 'should', 'always', 'pay', 'consequences', 'regardless', 'circumstances', 'obsessed', 'duty', 'track', 'down', 'put', 'Jean', 'away', 'prison.Over', 'direction', 'film', 'was', 'exceptional', 'were', 'moving', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'instance', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'Inspector', 'overbearing', 'villain', 'did', ""n't"", 'probably', 'much', 'more', 'complexity', 'character', 'novel', 'same', 'light', 'Jean', 'own', 'faults', 'terms', 'not', 'just', 'cut', 'dry', 'good', 'man', 'themes', 'redemption', 'forgiveness', 'are', 'really', 'underscored', 'scene', 'priest', 'Jean', 'escaped', 'then', 'years', 'later', 'different', 'philosophies', 'Jean', 'Inspector', 'Javert', 'come', 'light', 'film', 'setting', 'costumes', 'mood', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'epic', 'nature', 'parallels', 'Hugo', 'work', 'magnificently', 'one', 'minor', 'drawback', 'film', 'quality', 'bit', 'grainy', 'times', 'However', 'not', 'detract', 'viewing', 'too', 'much.To', 'take', 'enormous', 'novel', 'boil', 'down', 'two', 'hours', 'successfully', 'quite', 'feat', 'was', 'impressive', 'version', 'Hugo', 'classic']",N/A

The characters are flawlessly played by Richard Jordan (Valjean) and Anthony Perkins (The Prosecutor - Grim).  Their characters are consistent throughout the entire drama, and the ensemble cast is appropriately outfitted for this 18th century passion play.  To watch the unjust punishment for stealing bread equal 19 years of imprisonment, and then have Valjean escape, only to be pursued relentlessly by Perkins is next to chilling.  Will it ever end, you wonder, and the transformation of Valjean upon his being befriended by the Bishop and having his ""soul bought for God"" is next to inspiring, to be followed by the heart formation of a man of integrity and compassion and gentleness and mercy.This is wonderful film and suitable for the entire family.

72306,AVY0QDX64VUKM,0784001316,Inspector Karamazov,"[4, 9]","I went into this movie expecting it to be wonderfully bad, with cheesy lines, poor scriptwriting, horrible acting, and no respect for the book. However, I was sorely disappointed. Sure,  the special effects were cheesy, and there were some very silly lines/acting moments, but it wasn't horrible. It wasn't up to par, but it wasn't the worst thing in the world.Some of the characters were well acted. The bishop was nice (though the accent was very silly). Fantine was very pitiable (and borderline insane), I would have liked to see more of her, but the movie cut out her backstory. The Thenardiers (for the little amount they were in it) were worth a giggle.The best actor in this thing was Anthony Perkins as Javert. He got into the part rather well, and although he was a bit shouty, he actually did a good job with it. However, it still remains that he was just too cute (and effeminate) to be Javert. I am biased in this respect, however, because I've had a crush on him since the first time I saw Psycho, about four years ago.  Even so, he was the best part of this.The movie starts out in 1796, when Jean Valjean steals a loaf of bread that looks like a pizza. He's thrown in jail, attempts to escape, is antagonized by Javert, with whom he exchanges a few too many prolonged glances.Anyhoo, instead of being let go, JVJ falls off a rope while saving a guy. From here, the movie progresses mostly close to the book. (except for a scene where Convict!Violent!Valjean beats the crap out of a guy)He meets the bishop, becomes mayor,  meets Fantine, saves Faunchelevant, reveals himself to the court, and swears to save Cosette. All of this is, for the most part, book accurate (although Champmathieu is for some strange reason called Leblanc), down to the ""Fire me, please!"" scene with Javert, which I always find rather adorable. (though this time it featured even more prolonged glances between Javert and Valjean. Get a room, you two!)However, by the time they arrive at the convent, by climbing the walls, we've got a problem. There's only a half-hour left. The first hour and a half has been, if a bit campy, enjoyable. The rest of the movie is squeezed into this half hour, so there is no &Eacute;ponine, no Patron-Minette, none of the Barricade boys are named, save Enjolras and Marius. (thankfully they didn't mash Marius with Enjolras, but it might as well have been.)There is a Gavroche, but he's only there long enough to be obnoxious and die. (and not even by collecting bullets.) Funnily enough, they cared enough to keep in Monsieur Gillenormand, though he doesn't do much and apologizes at the end.The barricade is teeny, and all the fighting is over in ten minutes. This is rather depressing, because this is a great part of the story and one of the reasons it is so tragic. To cut it short is to lose that tragedy.In the same vein, the movie is cut short after Javert takes the jump (with a rather marvelous somersault). Marius and Cosette are married (though they've only shared about two scenes together, and have only known each other for about a day), and Valjean happily walks through the churchyard. The end.Wow, talk about a disappointment. The beginning was good and entertaining, only to have it come crashing down on the conclusion. It could have been good, at least in the ""so cheesy it's endearing"" sort of way (much like the '57/58 version, but that one also had nerdy fannish accuracy going for it), but instead, it falls flat.

The big bonus is that Richard Jordan and Anthony Perkins are simply excellent.  They both really make you understand the characters of Jean Valjean and Inspector Javert.  Some of the scenes STILL give me chills and I've seen this thing so many times because I show it to my World History high school classes.  And, that is all that really matters isn't it?  The book is obviously a classic of Western Literature, and they have to chop the story down so much to get into a movie format/screenplay, I feel they did an excellent job of boiling down the story.  I personally feel the newer versions just aren't as moving, although Umma Thurman as Cosette's mother is excellent.  I guess the main reason I'm writing this is because I'm just showing this again to my classes, and afterschool I decided to look up Richard Jordan to maybe get a website/address where I could write him and (do I have too much time or what?) tell him how much I appreciated his performance, and I found the he died of a brain tumor quite awhile back, I believe he may have died even earlier than Anthony Perkins, such a shame to lose these two so young.

72308,A1LVHR5OO45L5V,0784001316,JAG 2.0,"[2, 2]","I first saw this version of Victor Hugo's classic in the late seventies and, to this day, I'm impressed by the quality of the production.Most of us know the story of Jean Valjean, a man who was imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread for his sister's starving family. The story moves on to the barbaric cruelty of penal systems of that time and place where Jean slowly, over a period of decades, loses his humanity and becomes like some caged and mistreated animal whose thoughts are only of escape and revenge. Finally, Valjean does escape and meets ""a good Priest"" who ""withdraws all evil thoughts"" from him and thereafter Valjean commits his life to good.His nemesis, Javert, always remembers the convict that escaped from the prison where he was chief of guards. By strange circumstance, Javert and Valjean cross paths several times with Valjean always managing to escape. I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen this classic, so I'll end the synopsis there.Suffice it to say, this is an excellent adaptation of Hugo's powerful story. But, this is an adaptation and doesn't follow the book exactly. In a movie of this length, this is not surprising.

72310,A1G6B487JUHTHO,0784001316,Jephyr,"[5, 5]","I'd never heard of Les Miserables before this was broadcast on TV back in 1978.I was attending college in another city and over a break from school had invited a friend to come and visit my home-town for the first time.  He lived more than 3 hours away and as the time grew nearer for him to arrive I sat down to watch some TV.  My Mom rarely watched TV...and I'm not sure how it happened...but after a bit BOTH of us were sitting there completely hooked on this movie.In time my friend arrived, no doubt expecting some kind of welcome, maybe a tour of the house, an offer of something to eat or drink, introductions to my family etc.There was NONE of that!  The doorbell rang and I jumped up and ran for the door and rushed him in and told him we were watching a GREAT movie and invited him to sit down.  That was it.We didn't speak again until the next commercial break.Each time commercial breaks ended, it was back to being glued to the TV.  During certain scenes my Mom cried and dabbed at her eyes with a tissue...and I certainly got misty eyed at points.  But as a 18 or 19 year old guy, with a friend sitting there watching me, I wasn't about to show it.I'm sure he thought we were both mad anyway...or at least OBSESSED with TV.To defend my mom and I...had it been almost anything else we would've been a much better hosts and just shut off the TV.I'm happy to see it available here after all these years and am going to order it.I'll update this with my impressions after I see it again.Can it ever live up to THOSE expectations?  : )----------------EDIT:I was influenced by reviews talking about how the DVD version is 120 minutes long...missing 25 minutes or so from the original broadcast.  So rather than buy in a truncated version, I found it on YouTube and watched it there.My first impression is that it does hold up pretty well.  I remembered way more of it than I could've imagined.  At the end of each segment I found myself rapidly clicking to the next.  While it did lose some of its impact...I'd say that has more to do with knowing the story's outcome...while it ""unfolded"" as I watched it the first time.  (In the way ""The Sting"" can never be watched the same way after you see it the first time)Richard Jordan as Jean Valjean, who is sent to prison unjustly, puts in an understated but appropriate performance.  The surprise for me was Anthony Perkins.  I may not have even known who he was when I saw this movie originally.  His performance is really good and matches Jordan's in an understated but intense way.  Sir Ian Holm and Sir John Gielgud (before the ""Sir"" titles that is) make brief appearances.I've never seen any other versions and haven't read the book (yet) but would say for anyone wanting an introduction to this story...this would be a great place to start.And if I found a full length DVD version of this I might add it to my collection.",4,Held me spellbound in 1978...will it hold up?,1312675200,"08 7, 2011",2011,2881,"[""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'was', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'back', '1978.I', 'was', 'attending', 'college', 'city', 'break', 'school', 'had', 'invited', 'friend', 'come', 'visit', 'home-town', 'first', 'time', 'lived', 'more', '3', 'hours', 'away', 'time', 'grew', 'nearer', 'arrive', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'TV', 'Mom', 'rarely', 'watched', 'TV', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'happened', 'bit', 'BOTH', 'were', 'sitting', 'there', 'completely', 'hooked', 'movie.In', 'time', 'friend', 'arrived', 'doubt', 'expecting', 'kind', 'welcome', 'maybe', 'tour', 'house', 'offer', 'something', 'eat', 'drink', 'introductions', 'family', 'etc.There', 'was', 'NONE', 'doorbell', 'rang', 'jumped', 'up', 'ran', 'door', 'rushed', 'told', 'were', 'watching', 'GREAT', 'movie', 'invited', 'sit', 'down', 'was', 'it.We', 'did', ""n't"", 'speak', 'again', 'next', 'commercial', 'break.Each', 'time', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'ended', 'was', 'back', 'being', 'glued', 'TV', 'certain', 'scenes', 'Mom', 'cried', 'dabbed', 'eyes', 'tissue', 'certainly', 'got', 'misty', 'eyed', 'points', '18', '19', 'year', 'old', 'guy', 'friend', 'sitting', 'there', 'watching', 'was', ""n't"", 'show', 'it.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'thought', 'were', 'mad', 'anyway', 'least', 'OBSESSED', 'TV.To', 'defend', 'mom', 'had', 'been', 'almost', 'anything', 'else', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'much', 'better', 'hosts', 'just', 'shut', 'off', 'TV.I', ""'m"", 'happy', 'see', 'available', 'here', 'years', 'am', 'going', 'order', 'it.I', ""'ll"", 'update', 'impressions', 'see', 'ever', 'live', 'up', 'THOSE', 'expectations', 'was', 'influenced', 'reviews', 'talking', 'how', 'DVD', 'version', '120', 'minutes', 'long', 'missing', '25', 'minutes', 'so', 'original', 'broadcast', 'rather', 'buy', 'truncated', 'version', 'found', 'YouTube', 'watched', 'there.My', 'first', 'impression', 'hold', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'remembered', 'way', 'more', 'could', ""'ve"", 'imagined', 'end', 'segment', 'found', 'rapidly', 'clicking', 'next', 'did', 'lose', 'impact', ""'d"", 'say', 'more', 'do', 'knowing', 'story', 'outcome', 'unfolded', 'watched', 'first', 'time', 'way', 'Sting', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'watched', 'same', 'way', 'see', 'first', 'time', 'Richard', 'Jordan', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'who', 'sent', 'prison', 'unjustly', 'understated', 'appropriate', 'performance', 'surprise', 'was', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'even', 'known', 'who', 'was', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'originally', 'performance', 'really', 'good', 'matches', 'Jordan', 'understated', 'intense', 'way', 'Sir', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'Sir', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'Sir', 'titles', 'make', 'brief', 'appearances.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'other', 'versions', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'yet', 'would', 'say', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'introduction', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'place', 'start.And', 'found', 'full', 'length', 'DVD', 'version', 'might', 'add', 'collection']",N/A

Their versions of these two characters is perhaps magnificent, and excellent. They both are very believable. Perkins is the ideal Javert and exactly how I pictured him in the book. He is ruthless and just the ideal policeman we know in the book. The movie is primarily based on the relationship between Valjean and Javert and the other characters are not as focused.There is no Eponine, to my slight disappointment because she is a main character in the novel. Other than that there are no complaints.I will admit that I watched this on Youtube and I do not know how well the DVD format is, rumor has it that thirty minutes are missing from the DVD but I am not sure.All in all, the 1978 version of Les Miserables is well worth the time to watch.

72324,AY3AVLL5IWW9,0784001316,Russell Fanelli,"[0, 0]","Having read Victor Hugo's great novel, Les Miserables, I was interested to see how Anthony Perkins would portray the difficult role of Inspector Javert, the relentless antagonist and pursuer of Jean Valjean, the hero of this lengthy tale of the miserable of this world.  Perkins gives one of his better performances in his long career cut short by his death by pneumonia in 1992.  Perkins is true to Hugo's vision of a man filled with repressed hate and rage.  Javert is miserable himself and prosecutes without remorse or compassion anyone who breaks even the smallest and inconsequential laws of France.  Valjean was himself imprisoned for breaking into a bakery and stealing bread for his starving family.After 19 years in prison, Valjean is released and appears to have a chance to reform his life.  Unfortunately, in the novel, he steals 40 sous from a small boy, tries later to return the money, but is unsuccessful.  That theft of an insignificant sum could put Valjean back in jail for life if he is apprehended.Initially, Valjean escapes detection and begins a new life as Monsieur Madeleine.  He invents a manufacturing process that makes him wealthy and respected and he becomes mayor of his town.  Javert is posted as the police chief in this town and almost immediately comes to suspect that something is not right about the mayor, the former Jean Valjean, now M. Madeleine.Javert/Perkins is relentless in his pursuit of a person he knows in his heart is both a good man and a great force for good in the community.  He obeys and enforces the letter of the law without compunction or compassion.  In doing so he condemns himself to a life bereft of any semblance of humanity.  In the end, the truth of his existence is too much for him to bear.As anyone who has read the novel on which this film is based knows, it is impossible to film more than a small portion of a story which in the Signet Edition runs to 1488 pages.  Additionally, the filmmakers have taken liberties that purists will find difficult to accept.  I have chosen to focus on Anthony Perkins in one of his finest performamces.  Those readers of this review may enjoy comparing his version of Javert with the more recent and more famous portrayal by Russell Crowe.  I thought Perkins captured the spirit of Javert and recommend this film largely on the basis of his excellent performance.

Apparently there are no English sub-titles offered as an option.  Without them, I miss too much of the dialogue, therefore the story is not as interesting to me.  I'm sure there are other folks out there like me.Producers of DVD movies need to realize that they would sell many more DVDs if they would only offer the sub-titles.  I have learned the hard way to check first before I buy to see if they are available.  If not - - sorry, they've lost a sale.  And I was recently surprised to see that a friend of mine whose hearing is perfectly good,favored me by clicking on ""sub-titles"" when I was at her house one day, and she said at the end of the movie that she was amazed; she got more out of it than she ever had before,as she had missed understanding some of the dialogue.  People in general don't speak as clearly as they did a few decades ago.So, I hope this message gets to the right people eventually and that they will seriously consider adding English sub-titles to their movies.Thanks for lending your ear.  Perhaps some one of you will spread the good word to the powers-that-be?Again, thanks.",5,"They say it's the best version of the story yet, but........",1171152000,"02 11, 2007",2007,1180,"[""'m"", 'itching', 'purchase', 'version', 'story', 'will', 'not', 'Why', 'Apparently', 'are', 'English', 'sub-titles', 'offered', 'option', 'miss', 'too', 'much', 'dialogue', 'story', 'not', 'interesting', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'other', 'folks', 'there', 'me.Producers', 'DVD', 'movies', 'need', 'realize', 'would', 'sell', 'many', 'more', 'DVDs', 'would', 'only', 'offer', 'sub-titles', 'have', 'learned', 'hard', 'way', 'check', 'first', 'buy', 'see', 'are', 'available', 'not', 'sorry', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'sale', 'was', 'recently', 'surprised', 'see', 'friend', 'mine', 'hearing', 'perfectly', 'good', 'favored', 'clicking', 'sub-titles', 'when', 'was', 'house', 'one', 'day', 'said', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'amazed', 'got', 'more', 'ever', 'had', 'before', 'had', 'missed', 'understanding', 'dialogue', 'People', 'general', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'as', 'clearly', 'did', 'few', 'decades', 'hope', 'message', 'right', 'people', 'eventually', 'will', 'seriously', 'consider', 'adding', 'English', 'sub-titles', 'movies.Thanks', 'lending', 'ear', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'will', 'spread', 'good', 'word', 'powers-that-be', 'Again', 'thanks']",N/A

What a relief to find it's available on video. However, I'm disappointed that it's been cut down to 2 hours - the original telecast on TV divided it into 2 showings (2 consecutive evenings), about 3 hours apiece, if I remember right. Not including commercials, I would estimate the original (uncut) version was about 4-5 hours. So, in this VHS version, the story moves VERY fast to squeeze it into 2 hours. Still great to watch, but again, it's very trimmed down and every scene moves very quickly. It would be great in the future if it would become available in the original uncut version on DVD or a 2 or 3-set VHS version.",5,Still moving after all these years....,1019174400,"04 19, 2002",2002,750,"['saw', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'telecast', 'late', '70s', 'TV', 'Hallmark', 'special', 'presentation', 'never', 'forgot', 'What', 'relief', 'find', 'available', 'video', 'However', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'been', 'cut', 'down', '2', 'hours', 'original', 'telecast', 'TV', 'divided', '2', 'showings', '2', 'consecutive', 'evenings', 'about', '3', 'hours', 'apiece', 'remember', 'right', 'Not', 'including', 'commercials', 'would', 'estimate', 'original', 'uncut', 'version', 'was', '4-5', 'hours', 'So', 'VHS', 'version', 'story', 'VERY', 'fast', 'squeeze', '2', 'hours', 'Still', 'great', 'watch', 'again', 'very', 'trimmed', 'down', 'scene', 'very', 'quickly', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'future', 'would', 'become', 'available', 'original', 'uncut', 'version', 'DVD', '2', '3-set', 'VHS', 'version']",N/A
