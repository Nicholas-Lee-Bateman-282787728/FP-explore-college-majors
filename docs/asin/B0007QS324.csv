887500,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B0007QS324,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[3, 7]","Entourage is a show that I still can't believe can be nearly as good as it is.  The story follows an up-and-coming movie star named Vince Chase (Adrian Grenier) and his three best friends.  Eric ""E"" Murphy (Kevin Connolly), his manager and only responsible friend, Turtle (Jerry Ferrara), a pot-smoking moocher, and Johnny ""Drama"" Chase (Kevin Dillon), his older brother and out-of-work C-list actor.  The quartet basically spends most of the show hanging out, partying, chasing women, and living the life that most guys can only dream of.  Vince is a very good actor, but his looks have cemented him as Hollywood's next big thing, and he quickly changed from a poor boy from Queens into a very wealthy man.  Only he and Eric do any actual work while Drama and (especially) Turtle are content to get by on Vince's coattails.  They all live together in a huge house full of amazing televisions, the latest video game systems, pinball machines, and a pool.  The idea of watching four guys slacking off while living in a way most people can barely even imagine initially turned me off.  Still, it began getting great reviews from critics and was embraced by audiences, including my brother.  Finally, I decided to check it out.  Initially, I disliked it, but I later gave it a second chance towards the end of the second season, and I realized how good the show could be!On the surface, this show is what I described above, but it isn't nearly as shallow as it might seem.  Despite what we are led to believe, the main character is NOT Vince, it's Eric.  Eric is definitely playing the straight man against the (hilariously) clueless Drama, lazy and useless Turtle, and the easily-influenced Vince.  He must put up with his friends' bad choices as well as Vince's agent Ari Gold (Jeremy Piven), who is one of the show's best characters.  Ari is a great agent, but he must sacrifice much of his humanity in order to serve his client (much to the chagrin of his wife).  Ari and Eric constantly clash over how to deal with getting Vince his next job; Eric advises against a high-paying but trashy studio picture, which greatly upsets Ari.  The main storyline of the season is about how Vince and Eric try to find Vince's next film.  Also, Eric must deal with his relationship issues; he tends to get easily attached to the wrong women who end up emotionally abusing him.One of my favorite aspects of the series is Drama's attempts to break back out onto the scene.  Despite Vince's many attempts to help him out, Drama can't seem to get an acting job.  Pretty much all he has to look back on is a series called Viking Quest which is now syndicated on the Sci Fi Channel.  Of all the main characters, Turtle is by far my least favorite.  His role, while necessary to show the worst kind of person who can attach themselves to someone famous, exists to take without giving, provide Vince with drugs, and make fun of Eric.  Strangely, the least developed character is Vince himself; he comes off as somewhat of a one-dimensional star who gets hot women without even trying and is completely ignorant about issues of money, which he leaves up to Eric, who can barely bring himself to persuade Vince from buying more expensive (and unneccessary) items even though they don't have a steady income.  In fact, Grenier has even said that he wasn't a big fan of the first episode becuase of the way his character is portrayed.  And I must say that the first couple episodes are only so-so.  If I didn't already know that the quality would dramatically increase in future episodes, I would have given up.  However, once the characters' lifestyle is established, the series begins to get better.I would reccommend this series to anyone who has merely written Entourage off as a guilty pleasure (which is sort of is at times), but if you get a few hours in, you'll see that it is much more than four guys in LA living the high life.",5,"A Fun First Season of Lavishness, Extravagence, and Celebrity",1151107200,"06 24, 2006",2006,3913,"['Entourage', 'show', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'can', 'be', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'story', 'up-and-coming', 'movie', 'star', 'named', 'Vince', 'Chase', 'Adrian', 'Grenier', 'three', 'best', 'friends', 'Eric', 'E', 'Murphy', 'Kevin', 'Connolly', 'manager', 'only', 'responsible', 'friend', 'Turtle', 'Jerry', 'Ferrara', 'pot-smoking', 'moocher', 'Johnny', 'Drama', 'Chase', 'Kevin', 'Dillon', 'older', 'brother', 'out-of-work', 'C-list', 'actor', 'quartet', 'basically', 'most', 'show', 'hanging', 'out', 'partying', 'chasing', 'women', 'living', 'life', 'most', 'guys', 'can', 'only', 'dream', 'Vince', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'looks', 'have', 'cemented', 'Hollywood', 'next', 'big', 'thing', 'quickly', 'changed', 'poor', 'boy', 'Queens', 'very', 'wealthy', 'man', 'Only', 'Eric', 'do', 'actual', 'work', 'Drama', 'especially', 'Turtle', 'are', 'content', 'get', 'Vince', 'coattails', 'live', 'together', 'huge', 'house', 'full', 'amazing', 'televisions', 'latest', 'video', 'game', 'systems', 'pinball', 'machines', 'pool', 'idea', 'watching', 'four', 'guys', 'slacking', 'off', 'living', 'way', 'most', 'people', 'can', 'barely', 'even', 'imagine', 'initially', 'turned', 'Still', 'began', 'getting', 'great', 'reviews', 'critics', 'was', 'embraced', 'audiences', 'including', 'brother', 'Finally', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'Initially', 'disliked', 'later', 'gave', 'second', 'chance', 'end', 'second', 'season', 'realized', 'how', 'good', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'surface', 'show', 'what', 'described', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'shallow', 'might', 'seem', 'what', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'main', 'character', 'NOT', 'Vince', 'Eric', 'Eric', 'definitely', 'playing', 'straight', 'man', 'hilariously', 'clueless', 'Drama', 'lazy', 'useless', 'Turtle', 'easily-influenced', 'Vince', 'must', 'put', 'up', 'friends', 'bad', 'choices', 'as', 'well', 'Vince', 'agent', 'Ari', 'Gold', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'who', 'one', 'show', 'best', 'characters', 'Ari', 'great', 'agent', 'must', 'sacrifice', 'much', 'humanity', 'order', 'serve', 'client', 'much', 'chagrin', 'wife', 'Ari', 'Eric', 'constantly', 'how', 'deal', 'getting', 'Vince', 'next', 'job', 'Eric', 'high-paying', 'trashy', 'studio', 'picture', 'greatly', 'Ari', 'main', 'storyline', 'season', 'how', 'Vince', 'Eric', 'try', 'find', 'Vince', 'next', 'film', 'Also', 'Eric', 'must', 'deal', 'relationship', 'issues', 'get', 'easily', 'attached', 'wrong', 'women', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'emotionally', 'abusing', 'him.One', 'favorite', 'aspects', 'series', 'Drama', 'attempts', 'break', 'back', 'scene', 'Vince', 'many', 'attempts', 'help', 'out', 'Drama', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'acting', 'job', 'Pretty', 'much', 'look', 'back', 'series', 'called', 'Viking', 'Quest', 'now', 'syndicated', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'Channel', 'main', 'characters', 'Turtle', 'far', 'least', 'favorite', 'role', 'necessary', 'show', 'worst', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'attach', 'someone', 'famous', 'take', 'giving', 'provide', 'Vince', 'drugs', 'make', 'fun', 'Eric', 'Strangely', 'least', 'developed', 'character', 'Vince', 'off', 'somewhat', 'one-dimensional', 'star', 'who', 'hot', 'women', 'even', 'trying', 'completely', 'ignorant', 'issues', 'money', 'up', 'Eric', 'who', 'can', 'barely', 'bring', 'persuade', 'Vince', 'buying', 'more', 'expensive', 'unneccessary', 'items', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'steady', 'income', 'fact', 'Grenier', 'even', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'fan', 'first', 'episode', 'becuase', 'way', 'character', 'portrayed', 'must', 'say', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'are', 'only', 'so-so', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'quality', 'would', 'dramatically', 'increase', 'future', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'However', 'once', 'characters', 'lifestyle', 'established', 'series', 'get', 'better.I', 'would', 'reccommend', 'series', 'anyone', 'who', 'merely', 'written', 'Entourage', 'off', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'sort', 'times', 'get', 'few', 'hours', ""'ll"", 'see', 'much', 'more', 'four', 'guys', 'LA', 'living', 'high', 'life']",Entourage: Season 1

Entourage is for guys what sex and the city was for women. And the show is so addictive! I had heard about the show, but didn't start watching till season 3...and I was hooked! The show is that awesome. From the characters to the scenery to the diolouge - this show has it all. Season one is the shortest season - only 8 episodes. But it is definately worth having to see how it all began. IMO, don't let the first couple of episodes fool you. It takes a couple of episodes to start building up steam and for the writers to find their way...but stick with it and you will see it all start to gel together. And it just gets better and better. I own all the seasons now...up to season 4. Seaon 5 has just started on HBO but I'll buy the dvd as soon as it comes out! There's great chemistry between the characters...Vince, the handsome movie star who all things revolve around....Eric ""E""...Vince's best friend and voice of reason...Johnny Drama...Vince's brother who used to be on top and dreams of being there again...Turtle...Vince's friend and gopher. You get the sense that they are a real family - and would die for each other. Ari Gold is Vince's agent...and kind of the dysfunctional father figure (lol). Put them all together - and you have perfection. I would reccommend buying all the dvd's...because your going to want to watch them all over and over again.

In fact, I can see Queens Boulevard from my parents' house where they still live.  How can I not love the story of four boys from Queens living big in Hollywood?  I can even understand where Jeremy Piven's character was coming from. This show makes my boring suburban lifestyle very appealing!  Great scripts, great casting, with great directing - each episode is less than 30 minutes.  Very entertaining for mature viewers.The reason why I did not give this a 5-star rating was the way the menu was set up.  You have to press ENTER several times to get to each episode.

887504,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B0007QS324,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[2, 8]","At the core of ""Entourage"" we have a story about individuals who have no idea that there are consequences to their actions. Yes, they do drugs and womanize, but more outrageously they fling money at jets and houses, hit golf balls at celebrity's houses and berate people waiting in line to see the wrong movie. All of this is played for comedy to very successful results on this show. The story line revolves around Vincent Chase, an actor on his way up, and his friends who have attached themselves to him so that they too can live the easy life. The best of these characters in Vincent's brother, Johnny Drama. He especially takes off in the second half of the season when his idiotic ways become more prevalent. Together these characters seem to represent everything conservatives hate about Hollywood: They're vapid, self-involved, and most importantly rich. There is no better way to make a conservative angry than to not work for money he spends his entire life selling his soul wishing he could have, and Vincent has tons of cash. The best episode revolves around his appearance on Jimmy Kimmel's show. Watch as the characters expose an actress' sexual secret, accuse the host of abandonment, and get in the ever necessary product placement and try not to laugh. I also defy you to tell me that you do not know a Turtle. The dialogue is sharp, witty and funny. My only complaint would be that, except for the final episode, it makes no attempt to reach for any dramatic heights. ""Sex and the City,"" a very similar show, was masterful at blending comedy and drama. While watching the final episode I was unimpressed, until the very end. At the climax of the season they wallop you over the head with a heavy dose of sentimentality that works just right in it's attempt to humanize the characters. Of course not all shows have to make you feel, and in the barren wasteland that is TV comedy you should cherish every laugh you can get. Here we can laugh at a group of guys, who thanks to a single pretty face between the four of them are able to live the luxurious life of a rich frat house (yes they even live together). Girls are objects to be won and life is to be lived to the fullest. Along the way we deal with the dilemma of Vincent's next film (studio or indie?) and that provides a wonderful conflict between Eric (his best friend and manager) and Ari (his blood sucking, gold digging agent).

887507,A1UL0FO9AGP4LS,B0007QS324,"Daniel Putkowski ""novelist, pilot, world trav...","[0, 0]","Entourage takes you inside the life of an up-coming Hollywood star. Vince Chase has a hit movie, a high-pressure agent, and three of his pals from the neighborhood where he grew up. He's about to get a whole lot more, all the trappings of Hollywood including: sexy women, expensive handouts, and so much more. What makes this show a hit is the unrelenting dialog which borders on potty humor but actually punches hard at the subject at hand, be it the relationships between the guys, the tension between Vince's agent and his pals, or the dynamics of the Hollywood scene. Each vignette in an episode is quick and dirty, grabbing hold of a single point and making it quick, so the viewer has to pay close attention or you'll miss the subtlety. Of course performances are excellent with Jeremy Piven standing out as ""Ari"", Vince's agent. Piven puts it all out there the way a pro can, and yet somehow rises above cliche to surprise the viewer in most every episode.

This is a guilty pleasure that all guys should take in. There's hot woman, plenty of herbal indulgence, and all the drinks you can kick back.Adrian Grenier is Vincent Chase, a up and coming actor who's keeping it old school with his loyalty to his friends and brother, taking them along for the rollercoaster ride that is his acting career. Every girl seemingly is charmed by Vince...his life is right out of a bachelors fairytale! Let your mind wander freely...I can't make up my mind who my favorite character is but ""E"" is 1 of 2 characters I love.

Always looking for the angle to get hooked up on Vinces Celebrity status, Turtle is the wise cracking side kick type who adds the smart a@@ banter that keeps you laughing and keeps you watching...he is officially Vince's Driver...I'd love that job!!!Ari Gold is my other favorite character played to a tee by Jeremy Piven...he so often type casted as the nerdy sidekick or villan as he was in ""Old School"" but not anymore...Piven has broken that cycle playing Vinces ""ULTRA CRASS"" agent. Ari is always in the mix of the main plot, trying to get the big pay day for Vince in the form of his first breakout movie role.

I like... scratch that... I feel unbridled glee when one of these beautiful people get hit with a shovelful of trouble and a cannonball in the gut of comeuppance. Sorry to say, you won't experience this nasty little feeling when watching this splendid half-hour of comedy (with just a lightest sprinkling of drama). It is darn near impossible to root against the five main leads as they navigate their way through the sun-soaked, egomaniacal LA mayhem.The series has a dreamy, low-key flow that centers around the impossibly good-looking Vinnie Chase, a charming young actor on the rise who surrounds himself with a retinue of pals relocated from Queens, NY.  Entourage boasts the most entertaining comedic TV duo since Jason Bateman and David Garrison went head to head in ""It's Your Move."" Vincent's older brother and C-list actor, the cocky and sublimely insecure Johnny Drama (Kevin Dillon in his best role ever) is rarely seen without sidekick Turtle, the chubby yet confident gofer/chauffer/schemer. Everyone on the planet has met or hung out with a Turtle-kinda-guy, but probably none as impishly appealing.The effortless badinage between these two (and the entire group) is hilarious, realistic and not too overboard with f-bombs and requisite, hackneyed  guy talk. The exquisite Jeremy Piven plays fast-talking, &uuml;ber-agent Ari Gold who is equally hysterical with his complete lack of caring or self-censoring and is creating a new language for hipsters today - ""Let's hug it out."" -  in the vein of ""Swingers."" The scenes of unctuous Ari terrorizing his underlings at work are masterful, but the real fun is watching him at home trying to cut deals with his equally combative wife.The grounded Kevin Connolly plays Vince's best friend and manager who keeps it real and is the only one looking for an honest relationship, a nice contrast to the one-nighters by the others. The characters have their faults, but because they rarely take themselves too seriously and realize just how lucky they are to be living in mansions and hanging with the vapid pretty people, you hope this odd yet functional family unit always comes out on top.The writing, directing and editing is top-notch - subtle, wacky and always touching - and again, if I didn't make my point before, simply hilarious. One nitpick: the show goes a bit overboard with product placement, but hey, that's Hollywood, and they actually make light of it when Vinnie goes on the Jimmy Kimmel show. So all is forgiven.

And what is the downside and pitfalls to this? Those are the questions the wickedly funny, HBO comedy series, ""Entourage"" tries to answer as it takes a brilliant, satirical look at the lifestyle, deal making and personal politics behind modern day, Hollywood babylon. In the series we meet Vincent Chase (Adrian Grenier) an up and coming movie star, who is just on the cusp of truely hitting the big-time. This is coming to be, thanks in part to his conniving, deal-making agent, Ari Gold (wonderfully played by Jeremy Piven). But in a town where the sincerety is just as fake as the hugs, smiles and big [...], you need someone you can depend on to keep things real and watch your back. For this Vince depends on an ""Entourage"" of guys from his old Queens, neighborhood. They include his best friend and eternally worried manager, Eric (Kevin Connolly), his brother (a 'has-been' actor), Johnny 'Drama' (Kevin Dillon) and finally, Uber-mooch/gopher/driver, 'Turtle (Jerry Ferrara). We follow Vince and his boys as they work and play their way through the maze of hedonistic Hollywood, much like Alice experienced Wonderland. What makes this so much fun is that we get to vicariously experience the 'hot' willing women, Hollywood mansions and limos/Hummers with them. In this first season we are introduced to the characters and watch the main story arc of Vince getting the role (against Ari's wishes) in an artsy, 'indie' film called ""Queens Boulevard"". The writing for this show is razor sharp, the dialogue will make you bust a gut laughing (""Call me Helen Keller, because I'm a f**cking miracle worker!"") and the cast is fabulous. Watch throughout the series for celeb guest appearances from Jessica Alba, Luke Wilson, Gary Busey, Jimmy Kimmel and Val Kilmer (playing a dippy, 'new age', Sherpa/pot dealer).

Part of his routine dealt with the challenges facing middle-aging men.  At one point he admits that he tries to keep himself in SOME kind of shape for romance reasons: ""If it weren't for women, I'd be fatter than David Crosby!""I bring this up because women make men do things they wouldn't ordinarily do - some good... some bad.What if you had a group of men - four best friends from Queens ten years out of high school?  What if ONE of them became a big movie star, hired the other buddies as ""assistants"", moved to Hollywood, and generally got every wish of every teen-aged boy?Psychology students learn that the id is the part of the human personality that indulges every selfish desire: the characters of ""Entourage"" are almost all id.  (The show is most interesting when the characters are able to suppress their ""manliness"" long enough to show the more desirable human qualities: compassion, kindness, etc.)  Entourage follows the professional and love lives of four friends from New York.The group's world swirls around Vincent Chase (Adrian Grenier), an up and coming 30-ish movie star from Queens.  Vince is the kind of actor who is competing for roles with Jake Gyllenhaal and Leonardo DiCaprio.  Vince's older brother is Johnny ""Drama"" Chase (Kevin Dillon).  In a genius piece of casting Dillon, the not quite as accomplished and good-looking brother of Matt Dillon, plays the not as accomplished and not as good-looking brother of Vince.  While Vince walks through a world where he is always the center, with beautiful women and agents and producers constantly vying for his attention, ""Drama"" was once the star of ""Viking Quest"" two decades ago, and today struggles with attempts to keep his self-esteem afloat in the shadow of his mega-star brother.  Jerry Ferrara plays ""Turtle"", the least talented and only dumpy member of the group.  Turtle knows well that he owes everything to the fame of Vince.  He's happy to lead a love-life that consists of girls drawn to the aura that surrounds Vince who are not chosen by the man himself.  Kevin Connolly plays Eric ""E"" Murphy, Vince's best friend.  ""E"" is the character most rooted in the real world, the one most viewers would identify with.  Vince trusts ""E"" enough to make him his manager, and one of the best continuing storylines of the show involves ""E"" growing from a New York Pizza manager to Hollywood power player.Jeremy Piven plays Ari Gold, Vince's agent.  Piven has won several awards as the over-the-top Ari - intense and arrogant and vulgar, but again, some of the best moments of the show come when Ari shows the slightest hint of humanity.Entourage is a behind-the-scenes show, and succeeds in an extremely entertaining way, in the same way that ""The West Wing"" showed us a glimpse behind the curtain at the White House and ""Bull Durham"" gave us an idea of what happens in those pitcher's mound pow-wows that sports fans get to see, but never hear.Not quite grown up - and with little incentive to do so - the boys live lives that bounce between parties and restaurants, always surrounded by beautiful women, and usually looking for Vince's next project.What would YOU do if your best friend became the next ten million per movie star and invited you and your other buds from the old `hood to hang out in Hollywood?This show gives us a delicious ""what if"".",5,Wouldn't YOU?,1253577600,"09 22, 2009",2009,3447,"['few', 'years', 'ago', 'heard', 'Bobcat', 'Goldthwait', 'comeback', 'stand-up', 'CD', 'pretty', 'darned', 'funny', 'way', 'Part', 'routine', 'dealt', 'challenges', 'facing', 'middle-aging', 'men', 'one', 'point', 'keep', 'SOME', 'kind', 'shape', 'romance', 'reasons', 'were', ""n't"", 'women', ""'d"", 'be', 'fatter', 'David', 'Crosby', 'bring', 'up', 'women', 'make', 'men', 'do', 'things', 'would', ""n't"", 'ordinarily', 'do', 'good', 'had', 'group', 'men', 'four', 'best', 'friends', 'Queens', 'ten', 'years', 'high', 'school', 'What', 'ONE', 'became', 'big', 'movie', 'star', 'hired', 'other', 'buddies', 'assistants', 'moved', 'Hollywood', 'generally', 'got', 'wish', 'teen-aged', 'boy', 'Psychology', 'students', 'learn', 'id', 'part', 'human', 'personality', 'selfish', 'desire', 'characters', 'Entourage', 'are', 'almost', 'id', 'show', 'most', 'interesting', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'able', 'suppress', 'manliness', 'long', 'enough', 'show', 'more', 'desirable', 'human', 'qualities', 'compassion', 'kindness', 'etc', 'Entourage', 'professional', 'love', 'lives', 'four', 'friends', 'New', 'York.The', 'group', 'world', 'swirls', 'Vincent', 'Chase', 'Adrian', 'Grenier', 'up', 'coming', '30-ish', 'movie', 'star', 'Queens', 'Vince', 'kind', 'actor', 'who', 'competing', 'roles', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'Vince', 'older', 'brother', 'Johnny', 'Drama', 'Chase', 'Kevin', 'Dillon', 'genius', 'piece', 'casting', 'Dillon', 'not', 'quite', 'accomplished', 'good-looking', 'brother', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'not', 'accomplished', 'not', 'good-looking', 'brother', 'Vince', 'Vince', 'walks', 'world', 'where', 'always', 'center', 'beautiful', 'women', 'agents', 'producers', 'constantly', 'vying', 'attention', 'Drama', 'was', 'once', 'star', 'Viking', 'Quest', 'two', 'decades', 'ago', 'today', 'struggles', 'attempts', 'keep', 'self-esteem', 'afloat', 'shadow', 'mega-star', 'brother', 'Jerry', 'Ferrara', 'Turtle', 'least', 'talented', 'only', 'dumpy', 'member', 'group', 'Turtle', 'well', 'everything', 'fame', 'Vince', 'happy', 'lead', 'love-life', 'girls', 'drawn', 'aura', 'Vince', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'chosen', 'man', 'Kevin', 'Connolly', 'Eric', 'E', 'Murphy', 'Vince', 'best', 'friend', 'E', 'character', 'most', 'rooted', 'real', 'world', 'one', 'most', 'viewers', 'would', 'identify', 'Vince', 'E', 'enough', 'make', 'manager', 'one', 'best', 'continuing', 'storylines', 'show', 'E', 'growing', 'New', 'York', 'Pizza', 'manager', 'Hollywood', 'power', 'player.Jeremy', 'Piven', 'Ari', 'Gold', 'Vince', 'agent', 'Piven', 'won', 'several', 'awards', 'over-the-top', 'Ari', 'intense', 'arrogant', 'vulgar', 'again', 'best', 'moments', 'show', 'come', 'when', 'Ari', 'slightest', 'hint', 'humanity.Entourage', 'behind-the-scenes', 'show', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'way', 'same', 'way', 'West', 'Wing', 'showed', 'glimpse', 'curtain', 'White', 'House', 'Bull', 'Durham', 'gave', 'idea', 'what', 'pitcher', 'mound', 'sports', 'fans', 'get', 'see', 'never', 'quite', 'grown', 'up', 'little', 'incentive', 'do', 'so', 'boys', 'live', 'lives', 'bounce', 'parties', 'restaurants', 'always', 'surrounded', 'beautiful', 'women', 'usually', 'looking', 'Vince', 'next', 'project.What', 'would', 'YOU', 'do', 'best', 'friend', 'became', 'next', 'ten', 'million', 'movie', 'star', 'invited', 'other', 'buds', 'old', 'hood', 'hang', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'show', 'delicious', 'what']",Entourage: Season 1
887524,APOUYO1BEPK22,B0007QS324,"M. B Cole ""Kegrun""","[17, 20]","Having heard about Entourage for a couple years now, I decided to finally give it a shot after prolonging it for quite some time. The show didn't look that appealing to me and the main actor who plays Vincent, Adrian Grenier, just seemed like a `B' actor to me. But after I kept hearing my friends talk about the show, I decided to pick it up at a store here in Iraq. It has all 4 seasons in it for like 30 bucks... hehe.After a few episodes I was really into the show. It's definitely funny and that's what I wanted. To truly enjoy the show, you must let common sense go, because it just doesn't go well with this show. One prime example is that Vincent Chase is a lead star that's just had a huge movie premier. He's a big name actor (sorta) now and he's got a pretty boy face to go with that role. But he can go anywhere he wants around town and never seem to get swamped with fans or the paparazzi. If you can let the little things go, I believe you'll truly enjoy the show.Now Vince is an up and coming star and he has his boys from high school with him along with his old brother Johnny `Drama' Chase. Drama, as most call him, is what you would call a `B' actor. Most of his stints have been not big characters on some popular shows such as Melrose Place and Viking Quest (which I'm thinking is supposed to be Hercules) and some not so known shows as well.  Turtle is one of the good friends, and his main job is to be a driver and do certain errands Vinny needs. He's not Vin's slave by no means, but this is how he earns his keep so he doesn't have to be a full blown moocher. Eric is Vince's best friend and has been since they were about 6 years old. Eric has his head on his shoulders and is here to try and help Vince with his career. He's not trying to be a mooch, but just trying to help his friend. Vince makes Eric his manager to help with scripts and to make his life easier. And when I say easier...I mean it as in Vinny doesn't have to talk to Ari Gold (played BRILLIANTLY by Jeremy Piven), a cold hearted, hard as nails, wise cracking, smart butt, genius, and on the top of his game agent. Ari and Eric's arguments are some of the best parts of the show. Both hard headed and both trying to help Vincent, but in somewhat different ways. The whole cast is great and definitely grow on you as the season(s) goes on. Along with the cast you also have a LOT of big name cameos. I was quite surprised to see so many.What I love about the show is that it makes life seem so fun being rich. Once Vinny makes millions from his first movie, he buys a huge house for him and friends to live in. Cars for them. They take trips when they want. Just hang out and do things we all wished we could do. And when someone like Jessica Alba talks to them, everything is so nonchalant. If it was me, I don't think I'd be able to even speak. Ok maybe I would, but my words would come out all Jibba Jabba like.And yes there is a story that goes with the show. In season one the big thing is getting Vincent another movie while he's hot. Eric puts a hurting on that because Ari just wants whatever will get Vincent big money, while Eric wants to help get Vinny a good script regardless of the money. Like other shows, it has one `main' theme for the season, while each episode has a mini-story itself.All in all, I'm very happy I tried this show out. Very funny and I highly recommend it. Especially to guys, even though I know a lot of girls like it too. But like another reviewer mentioned... Entourage is sorta like a Sex in the City for guys.The show does have a LOT of language that isn't suitable for children in my opinion. Some nudity (though not much) is also in here...like boobs!",5,Every single episode has made me laugh,1208736000,"04 21, 2008",2008,3687,"['Having', 'heard', 'Entourage', 'couple', 'years', 'now', 'decided', 'finally', 'give', 'shot', 'prolonging', 'quite', 'time', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'appealing', 'main', 'actor', 'who', 'Vincent', 'Adrian', 'Grenier', 'just', 'seemed', 'B', 'actor', 'kept', 'hearing', 'friends', 'talk', 'show', 'decided', 'pick', 'up', 'store', 'here', 'Iraq', '4', 'seasons', '30', 'bucks', 'hehe.After', 'few', 'episodes', 'was', 'really', 'show', 'definitely', 'funny', 'what', 'wanted', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'show', 'must', 'let', 'common', 'sense', 'go', 'just', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'show', 'One', 'prime', 'example', 'Vincent', 'Chase', 'lead', 'star', 'just', 'had', 'huge', 'movie', 'premier', 'big', 'name', 'actor', 'sorta', 'now', 'got', 'pretty', 'boy', 'face', 'go', 'role', 'can', 'go', 'anywhere', 'town', 'never', 'seem', 'get', 'swamped', 'fans', 'paparazzi', 'can', 'let', 'little', 'things', 'go', 'believe', ""'ll"", 'truly', 'enjoy', 'show.Now', 'Vince', 'up', 'coming', 'star', 'boys', 'high', 'school', 'along', 'old', 'brother', 'Johnny', 'Drama', 'Chase', 'Drama', 'most', 'call', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'B', 'actor', 'Most', 'stints', 'have', 'been', 'not', 'big', 'characters', 'popular', 'shows', 'such', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'Viking', 'Quest', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'supposed', 'be', 'Hercules', 'not', 'so', 'known', 'shows', 'well', 'Turtle', 'one', 'good', 'friends', 'main', 'job', 'be', 'driver', 'do', 'certain', 'errands', 'Vinny', 'needs', 'not', 'Vin', 'slave', 'means', 'how', 'keep', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'full', 'blown', 'moocher', 'Eric', 'Vince', 'best', 'friend', 'been', 'were', 'about', '6', 'years', 'old', 'Eric', 'head', 'shoulders', 'here', 'try', 'help', 'Vince', 'career', 'not', 'trying', 'be', 'mooch', 'just', 'trying', 'help', 'friend', 'Vince', 'Eric', 'manager', 'help', 'scripts', 'make', 'life', 'easier', 'when', 'say', 'easier', 'mean', 'Vinny', ""n't"", 'have', 'talk', 'Ari', 'Gold', 'played', 'BRILLIANTLY', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'cold', 'hearted', 'hard', 'nails', 'wise', 'cracking', 'smart', 'butt', 'genius', 'top', 'game', 'agent', 'Ari', 'Eric', 'arguments', 'are', 'best', 'parts', 'show', 'hard', 'headed', 'trying', 'help', 'Vincent', 'somewhat', 'different', 'ways', 'whole', 'cast', 'great', 'definitely', 'grow', 'season', 'cast', 'also', 'have', 'LOT', 'big', 'name', 'cameos', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'see', 'so', 'many.What', 'love', 'show', 'life', 'seem', 'so', 'fun', 'being', 'rich', 'Once', 'Vinny', 'millions', 'first', 'movie', 'huge', 'house', 'friends', 'live', 'Cars', 'take', 'trips', 'when', 'want', 'Just', 'hang', 'out', 'do', 'things', 'wished', 'could', 'do', 'when', 'someone', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'talks', 'everything', 'so', 'nonchalant', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'able', 'even', 'speak', 'Ok', 'maybe', 'would', 'words', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'Jibba', 'Jabba', 'yes', 'story', 'show', 'season', 'one', 'big', 'thing', 'getting', 'Vincent', 'movie', 'hot', 'Eric', 'hurting', 'Ari', 'just', 'will', 'get', 'Vincent', 'big', 'money', 'Eric', 'help', 'get', 'Vinny', 'good', 'script', 'regardless', 'money', 'other', 'shows', 'one', 'main', 'theme', 'season', 'episode', 'mini-story', 'itself.All', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'tried', 'show', 'out', 'Very', 'funny', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Especially', 'guys', 'even', 'know', 'lot', 'girls', 'too', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'Entourage', 'sorta', 'Sex', 'City', 'guys.The', 'show', 'have', 'LOT', 'language', ""n't"", 'suitable', 'children', 'opinion', 'nudity', 'not', 'much', 'also', 'here', 'boobs']",Entourage: Season 1

887531,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B0007QS324,Nicholas Carroll,"[80, 103]","I watched this out of morbid curiosity about the concept of ""entourages"", those parasitic friends of celebrities who reap the benefit of the luxurious lifestyle without having to work for it (except to keep the actor from being lonely, heaven forbid such a needy person from ever being alone!). That this show was produced by ""Marky"" Mark Wahlberg, who is particularly known for his entourage, lends great realism and credibility to this series.The first episode was okay. I almost didn't want to watch any more after that, because it didn't really impress me, but after episode 2, I was hooked! What I don't understand is why the true stars of this show play second fiddle to the main guy (Adrian Grenier, playing an up-and-coming actor who can't make decisions on his own). Kevin Connolly is the star of this show, playing best friend Eric, who manages Vincent Chase's career and other choices, even though he doesn't have any experience in Hollywood or any personal connections to it, other than being the high school buddy who gives up his personal goals to follow his famous friend to Hollywood. He is the brains behind the group and should be the one making the Hollywood career instead of the lame-brained actor friend.Jerry Ferrara as the wise-cracking friend Turtle reminds me of many sidekicks who tag along in life to their star buddies. He offers much of the humor with his comments delivered with a Brooklyn-style accent (although they are from Queens). He has a loyal guard dog vibe, all too willing to accept left over scraps of women Vincent no longer wants or never wanted.Kevin Dillon plays the older brother of Vincent with a waning acting career of his own. Its an ironic role, as he looks and sounds familiar to his own famous brother Matt Dillon. However, I find his character to be the most annoying, particularly that he's a hanger-on, expecting his brother's popularity to help his own career out of the B-list of actors.The biggest joy to watch is Jeremy Piven, who often plays the loyal sidekick in many films (""The Family Man"", ""Serendipity""). He simply shines here, as a sleazy agent with a wandering eye. He doesn't like the fact that to get through to his client Vincent, sometimes he has to talk to Eric, the manager. Jeremy is an actor I'd like to see in more meaningful roles, so hopefully this series will graduate him out of the cast-typing of loyal sidekick into an actor of his own standing.What really lends a realism to this show are the cameos and sly references to famous people or the use of invented celebrities to wink at the real ones (such as the female singer with the hots for Vincent even though she made a very public vow of chastity until marriage--shades of Jessica Simpson/Britney Spears). Even Mark Wahlberg has a cameo. There are a few surprises by other celebrities, and even a former reality show winner (the very wholesomely beautiful Lisa Donohue of ""Big Brother 3"") makes an appearance.I can't wait to see season 2 when it comes on DVD. I only wish the first season had more than 8 half hour episodes. Hopefully they can maintain a longer season for however long this series is meant to last.

887535,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0007QS324,Robert Moore,"[3, 10]","Of all the shows that HBO has done in the past few years, this is overall one of the least interesting.  The main characters are fairly likable and Jeremy Piven is outstanding, but all in all not too much happens.  A number of reviewers here have used the word ""realistic,"" but how would anyone know?  I suspect that much of the appeal is similar to reading People magazine.  We voyeuristically get to look into the life of a pretend celebrity and his group of cronies, frequently encountering real celebrities.Here is the basic problem with the show, however:  there are no especially interesting story arcs, no especially funny episodes, and apart from Jeremy Piven character, and no real character development.  I have only seen Season One and perhaps it picks up in season two, but based on the first season I have to confess that I am baffled by the widespread attention it is getting.  Piven is a delight in every scene he is in, but even performers I have enjoyed in other projects, like my beloved Debi Mazar and the impossible adorable Samaire Armstrong, are at less than their best.  One exception to the overall mediocrity of the performers is Kevin Dillon as Johnny Chase, Vincent's brother.  Perhaps because he has in real life a better known actor brother (Matt), he is wonderfully convincing as a has-been struggling under his brother's shadow.  But Adrian Grenier is simply awful as the supposed hot young movie star.  He seems in fact to be a hopeless pretty boy who might have limited potential on television melodrams, but not much else.  Jerry Ferrara as Turtle has to be one of the most annoying actors in the world.  Kevin Connolly as Eric is fairly likable, but at most he comes across as a moderately enjoyable but mildly pathetic hanger on.The relative success of the series disturbs me.  I can see why some people might enjoy it.  It has a certain degree of name dropping and settings that celebrity fans could enjoy.  But what if you aren't a celebrity hound?  The show makes no important points about the world Vincent and his boys inhabit.  The show doesn't even explore that world but merely accepts it and uses it as the background to some mildly comic situations.  Perhaps the show improves in the second season, but under no circumstances could I describe it as more than mildly enjoyable.  It beats driving in heavy traffic, but it isn't something that I want to watch simply because it is truly good.  If I think about some truly good shows on TV--LOST, say, or VERONICA MARS or THE GILMORE GIRLS--the contrast couldn't be greater.  One of the saddest things to consider is that with the ending of THE SOPRANOS and DEADWOOD, this is pretty much the flagship show for HBO.  Lo! how the mighty are fallen.  Just to think that only a few years ago this was the cable network that was home for so many great shows.  Perhaps the new SIX FEET UNDER will premiere soon.",3,Reasonably enjoyable but overall pretty bland,1151107200,"06 24, 2006",2006,2897,"['shows', 'HBO', 'done', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'overall', 'one', 'least', 'interesting', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'fairly', 'likable', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'outstanding', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'happens', 'number', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'used', 'word', 'realistic', 'how', 'would', 'anyone', 'know', 'suspect', 'much', 'appeal', 'similar', 'reading', 'People', 'magazine', 'voyeuristically', 'get', 'look', 'life', 'pretend', 'celebrity', 'group', 'cronies', 'frequently', 'encountering', 'real', 'celebrities.Here', 'basic', 'problem', 'show', 'however', 'are', 'especially', 'interesting', 'story', 'arcs', 'especially', 'funny', 'episodes', 'apart', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'character', 'real', 'character', 'development', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'Season', 'One', 'perhaps', 'up', 'season', 'two', 'based', 'first', 'season', 'have', 'confess', 'am', 'baffled', 'widespread', 'attention', 'getting', 'Piven', 'delight', 'scene', 'even', 'performers', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'other', 'projects', 'beloved', 'Debi', 'Mazar', 'impossible', 'adorable', 'Samaire', 'Armstrong', 'are', 'less', 'best', 'One', 'exception', 'overall', 'mediocrity', 'performers', 'Kevin', 'Dillon', 'Johnny', 'Chase', 'Vincent', 'brother', 'Perhaps', 'real', 'life', 'better', 'known', 'actor', 'brother', 'Matt', 'wonderfully', 'convincing', 'has-been', 'struggling', 'brother', 'shadow', 'Adrian', 'Grenier', 'simply', 'awful', 'supposed', 'hot', 'young', 'movie', 'star', 'fact', 'be', 'hopeless', 'pretty', 'boy', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'limited', 'potential', 'television', 'melodrams', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'Jerry', 'Ferrara', 'Turtle', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'annoying', 'actors', 'world', 'Kevin', 'Connolly', 'Eric', 'fairly', 'likable', 'most', 'across', 'moderately', 'enjoyable', 'mildly', 'pathetic', 'hanger', 'on.The', 'relative', 'success', 'series', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'might', 'enjoy', 'certain', 'degree', 'name', 'dropping', 'settings', 'celebrity', 'fans', 'could', 'enjoy', 'what', 'are', ""n't"", 'celebrity', 'hound', 'show', 'important', 'points', 'world', 'Vincent', 'boys', 'inhabit', 'show', ""n't"", 'even', 'explore', 'world', 'merely', 'background', 'mildly', 'comic', 'situations', 'Perhaps', 'show', 'second', 'season', 'circumstances', 'could', 'describe', 'more', 'mildly', 'enjoyable', 'driving', 'heavy', 'traffic', ""n't"", 'something', 'want', 'watch', 'simply', 'truly', 'good', 'think', 'truly', 'good', 'shows', 'TV', 'LOST', 'say', 'VERONICA', 'MARS', 'THE', 'GILMORE', 'GIRLS', 'contrast', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'greater', 'One', 'saddest', 'things', 'consider', 'ending', 'THE', 'SOPRANOS', 'DEADWOOD', 'pretty', 'much', 'flagship', 'show', 'HBO', 'Lo', 'how', 'mighty', 'are', 'fallen', 'Just', 'think', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'cable', 'network', 'was', 'home', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'shows', 'Perhaps', 'new', 'SIX', 'FEET', 'UNDER', 'will', 'premiere', 'soon']",Entourage: Season 1

I haven't tried DEAD LIKE ME or whatever that funeral home show is because every single preview shows men kissing on the mouth.  Not exactly what I want to watch.  I only got about ten minutes into DEADWOOD before the trash talk trashed me out.  Jersey mobsters talk that way, yes.  Cowboys?  Don't know.  But didn't want to hear it from them.  I've heard good things about ROME but, like all HBO shows, I'll probably catch it on DVD if I keep hearing about it.Then I finally got around to watching ENTOURAGE on DVD.  In order.  If you're not hooked immediately, give it an episode or two because it got better as it went.  You get the feeling that this was a very inside job.  And plenty of cameos from famous people as themselves add to the realism and the humor.Jeremy Piven is hilarious as the no-holds-barred Hollywood shark chewing his way up the food chain.  His caustic, rapid-fire dialogue is a joy to listen to.Kevin Dillon as Johnny Drama is also very funny: the older brother who had his shot but threw it away in ways that always seem to come back to haunt him, both personally (feuds with Jimmy Kimmel & Hugh Hefner) and professionally (his hot shot brother has to get him an agent).This is a smart, knowing show where even the little moments are winners.  I loved the sad sack clown at Ari's kid's birthday party trying to give Ari his headshot and his audition reel during the party.  And it's completely believable that a movie can come together and get made by people who dislike each other only because one of them knows where to score the best weed.  The lust, the greed, the selfishness, the shameless self-promotion--hooray for Hollywood!I'm really looking forward to the rest of the seasons!",5,"HBO's Best Show Since ""The Sopranos""",1250726400,"08 20, 2009",2009,1819,"['loved', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'THE', 'SOPRANOS', 'best', 'TV', 'ever', 'Then', 'quality', 'fell', 'off', 'have', ""n't"", 'tried', 'DEAD', 'LIKE', 'ME', 'funeral', 'home', 'show', 'single', 'preview', 'shows', 'men', 'kissing', 'mouth', 'Not', 'exactly', 'what', 'want', 'watch', 'only', 'got', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'DEADWOOD', 'trash', 'talk', 'trashed', 'out', 'Jersey', 'mobsters', 'talk', 'way', 'yes', 'Cowboys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'ROME', 'HBO', 'shows', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'catch', 'DVD', 'keep', 'hearing', 'it.Then', 'finally', 'got', 'watching', 'ENTOURAGE', 'DVD', 'order', ""'re"", 'not', 'hooked', 'immediately', 'give', 'episode', 'two', 'got', 'better', 'went', 'get', 'feeling', 'was', 'very', 'inside', 'job', 'plenty', 'cameos', 'famous', 'people', 'add', 'realism', 'humor.Jeremy', 'Piven', 'hilarious', 'no-holds-barred', 'Hollywood', 'shark', 'chewing', 'way', 'food', 'chain', 'caustic', 'rapid-fire', 'dialogue', 'joy', 'listen', 'to.Kevin', 'Dillon', 'Johnny', 'Drama', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'had', 'shot', 'threw', 'away', 'ways', 'always', 'seem', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'personally', 'feuds', 'Jimmy', 'Kimmel', 'Hugh', 'Hefner', 'professionally', 'hot', 'shot', 'brother', 'get', 'agent', '.This', 'smart', 'knowing', 'show', 'where', 'even', 'little', 'moments', 'are', 'winners', 'loved', 'sad', 'sack', 'clown', 'Ari', 'kid', 'birthday', 'party', 'trying', 'give', 'Ari', 'headshot', 'audition', 'reel', 'party', 'completely', 'believable', 'movie', 'can', 'come', 'together', 'get', 'made', 'people', 'who', 'dislike', 'other', 'only', 'one', 'where', 'score', 'best', 'weed', 'lust', 'greed', 'selfishness', 'shameless', 'self-promotion', 'hooray', 'Hollywood', ""'m"", 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'rest', 'seasons']",Entourage: Season 1

However, I have friends who do and when some of them were talking about the latest season of the HBO show, ENTOURAGE, I had no idea what they were talking about or what the hype was about.  Then this past summer I was staying at a hotel and was flipping through the channels and came across an episode of ENTOURAGE (Season 3) that had just started.  Actually, I didn't even know it was ENTOURAGE until after the show ended.  But, I had been intrigued by the opening scene and sat fascinated for over twenty minutes.  The writing was superb and I found myself compelled by the characters on the screen and wanted to see what would happen to them next.  I had become hooked and a fan just through that one episode.Season One of the series is only eight episodes long.  In the pilot episode the characters of the series or introduced:  Vincent Chase (Adrian Grenier) Hollywood's latest big star and the man who the entourage hovers; Eric Murphy (Kevin Connolly) Vince's best friend and personal manager; Johnny ""Drama"" Chase (Kevin Dillon) Vincent's half brother and a B-actor who was living in L.A. trying to make it big long before his brother hit the scene; and Turtle (Jerry Ferrara) Vincent's 2nd closest friend and supposedly musician of the group.  These four grew up together back in Queens and watching them you know that no matter that what happens they'll stick with each other through thick and thin.  Oh, there's one other member of Vince's entourage, his agent, Ari Gold (Jeremy Piven).  Vince is going to be the biggest thing in Hollywood and Ari knows it, but their relationship is more than that--Ari likes Vince and his boys even if he won't ever admit itAt face value, ENTOURAGE is basically a soap opera for men, but set in L.A.  The first season could also be described as a dramatic SEINFELD set in L.A. because not a whole lot happens.  There are only eight episodes in the season revolving around Vince's first big movie premier and his next movie project.  There are references and allusions that help with the continuity of the show, but not a lot really happens.  There are a lot of pretty woman and locations and that's one appeal.  Another might be Jeremy Piven.  His portrayal of Ari Gold is magnificent and a tour-de-force. Ari appears in every episode, but his character is so strong one wishes that he could be in every other scene.  There are also the guest stars that pop up:  Gary Busey, Jessica Alba, Scarlett  Johansson, and Jimmy Kimmel are just a handful of the guest stars that show up during the season.For me, besides my fascinating introduction to the series, there are two other factors that have caused me to be drawn to the series.  One is the cinematography.  The shots done in this show are amazing.  From ten minute one shot takes to personal moments filmed through a window like memory in the scrapbook of one's mind the filming one this series is unlike anything I have ever seen done on television before. In that sense, the series is ground breaking.The other thing that draws me to the series is the relationship between the four friends.  I don't live in the way that Vince and his boys live.  I don't live in L.A. and my friends and I don't talk the way Vince does or treat woman the way they do.  However, the bond of friendship they share is something I relate to strongly.  I've compared ENTOURAGE to SEINFELD and a soap opera, but it's also kind of like a prepped-up version of BAND OF BROTHERS but without any blood and guts.The first season does move slowly, but from what I've seen and been told that's because it's setting the tone and characters for things to come later.  After having watched all of series one, I'm excited to see how things turn out in Season Two (and find out how Vince Chase got picked as Aquaman).This is only a two disc set with eight episodes so the special features with this DVD are limited.  There are creator commentaries on Episode 1 ""Pilot""; Episode 6 ""Busey and the Beach""; and Episode 8 ""New York"".  There are previews for each episode and there is a short featurette/interview with the cast and crew promoting the show.",4,Getting Started.,1158969600,"09 23, 2006",2006,4169,"['do', ""n't"", 'have', 'HBO', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'cable', 'However', 'have', 'friends', 'who', 'do', 'when', 'were', 'talking', 'latest', 'season', 'HBO', 'show', 'ENTOURAGE', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'were', 'talking', 'what', 'hype', 'was', 'about', 'Then', 'past', 'summer', 'was', 'staying', 'hotel', 'was', 'flipping', 'channels', 'came', 'episode', 'ENTOURAGE', 'Season', '3', 'had', 'just', 'started', 'Actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'was', 'ENTOURAGE', 'show', 'ended', 'had', 'been', 'intrigued', 'opening', 'scene', 'sat', 'fascinated', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'writing', 'was', 'superb', 'found', 'compelled', 'characters', 'screen', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'had', 'become', 'hooked', 'fan', 'just', 'one', 'episode.Season', 'One', 'series', 'only', 'eight', 'episodes', 'long', 'pilot', 'episode', 'characters', 'series', 'introduced', 'Vincent', 'Chase', 'Adrian', 'Grenier', 'Hollywood', 'latest', 'big', 'star', 'man', 'who', 'entourage', 'hovers', 'Eric', 'Murphy', 'Kevin', 'Connolly', 'Vince', 'best', 'friend', 'personal', 'manager', 'Johnny', 'Drama', 'Chase', 'Kevin', 'Dillon', 'Vincent', 'half', 'brother', 'B-actor', 'who', 'was', 'living', 'L.A.', 'trying', 'make', 'big', 'long', 'brother', 'hit', 'scene', 'Turtle', 'Jerry', 'Ferrara', 'Vincent', '2nd', 'closest', 'friend', 'supposedly', 'musician', 'group', 'four', 'grew', 'up', 'together', 'back', 'Queens', 'watching', 'know', 'matter', 'what', ""'ll"", 'stick', 'other', 'thick', 'thin', 'Oh', 'one', 'other', 'member', 'Vince', 'entourage', 'agent', 'Ari', 'Gold', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'Vince', 'going', 'be', 'biggest', 'thing', 'Hollywood', 'Ari', 'relationship', 'more', 'Ari', 'Vince', 'boys', 'even', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'admit', 'itAt', 'face', 'value', 'ENTOURAGE', 'basically', 'soap', 'opera', 'men', 'set', 'L.A', 'first', 'season', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'described', 'dramatic', 'SEINFELD', 'set', 'L.A.', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'are', 'only', 'eight', 'episodes', 'season', 'revolving', 'Vince', 'first', 'big', 'movie', 'premier', 'next', 'movie', 'project', 'are', 'references', 'allusions', 'help', 'continuity', 'show', 'not', 'lot', 'really', 'are', 'lot', 'pretty', 'woman', 'locations', 'one', 'appeal', 'might', 'be', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'portrayal', 'Ari', 'Gold', 'magnificent', 'tour-de-force', 'Ari', 'episode', 'character', 'so', 'strong', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'other', 'scene', 'are', 'also', 'guest', 'stars', 'pop', 'up', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Jimmy', 'Kimmel', 'are', 'just', 'handful', 'guest', 'stars', 'show', 'up', 'season.For', 'fascinating', 'introduction', 'series', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'factors', 'have', 'caused', 'be', 'drawn', 'series', 'One', 'cinematography', 'shots', 'done', 'show', 'are', 'amazing', 'ten', 'minute', 'one', 'shot', 'personal', 'moments', 'filmed', 'window', 'memory', 'scrapbook', 'one', 'mind', 'filming', 'one', 'series', 'anything', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'done', 'television', 'sense', 'series', 'ground', 'other', 'thing', 'series', 'relationship', 'four', 'friends', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'way', 'Vince', 'boys', 'live', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'L.A.', 'friends', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'way', 'Vince', 'treat', 'woman', 'way', 'do', 'However', 'bond', 'friendship', 'share', 'something', 'relate', 'strongly', ""'ve"", 'compared', 'ENTOURAGE', 'SEINFELD', 'soap', 'opera', 'also', 'kind', 'prepped-up', 'version', 'BAND', 'OF', 'BROTHERS', 'blood', 'guts.The', 'first', 'season', 'move', 'slowly', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'been', 'told', 'setting', 'tone', 'characters', 'things', 'come', 'later', 'having', 'watched', 'series', 'one', ""'m"", 'excited', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'turn', 'out', 'Season', 'Two', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'Vince', 'Chase', 'got', 'picked', 'Aquaman', '.This', 'only', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'eight', 'episodes', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'are', 'limited', 'are', 'creator', 'commentaries', 'Episode', '1', 'Pilot', 'Episode', '6', 'Busey', 'Beach', 'Episode', '8', 'New', 'York', 'are', 'previews', 'episode', 'short', 'featurette/interview', 'cast', 'crew', 'promoting', 'show']",Entourage: Season 1

These are all key ingredients that make ""Entourage"" thoroughly entertaining, as well as freighting when you think about how it's based on reality.I take the show as a cautionary tale; the entertainment industry is where I have just barely started to get my feet wet. There is a lot of truth in this fictional show: either everyone wants a piece of you or no one knows your name and can't spare a minute of their time. From my limited time spent dealing with people of the industry, on either coast, I have already found more jerks and egos-out-of-control than I care to recount. ""Entourage"" does an excellent job of exposing the dangers of the L.A. lifestyle, while simultaneously managing to present them in a thoroughly enjoyable manner.The superficial world that is the entertainment business is navigated successfully through the four different personalities that make up the entourage. The four personalities of the Rising Star, Has-Been, Bum, and Level-headed Average Guy balance out the cast and provide a character for everyone to enjoy or relate to. Their friendship and their dependence on each other make the characters a success, as well as a success in the world of the show.Jeremy Piven's role as agent to rising star, Vincent Chase, is thoroughly entertaining as well as aggravating. He's not quite the villain, but the perfect embodiment of the guy you don't want working against you. His quick one-liners and perfect delivery make it a joy to watch the show, whereas a real-life encounter with a guy such as him would probably make you want to deck him.""Entourage"" is rife with inside jokes, but not enough to lose the average viewer. Instead, the average viewer might just see the show as a bunch of losers whining about the good life and living high off the hog without really working. I enjoy it, but it's certainly not for everybody. I see it as another example of why I don't, and never want to, live in Los Angeles.Show business is unlike any other business: they work by their own rules and decide who to let into their little clique.
