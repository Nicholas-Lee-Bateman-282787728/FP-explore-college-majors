455464,A2PQPTFYTTUXBL,6305238065,,"[3, 3]","This is one of the most intelligent films ever made. It is a metaphor for the prison that is the limitations of the human mind/western society.The key to understanding the film is illustrated in the open scene when we see a lone guy get turned into dog food: they can't survive alone, they have to cooperate with others.Unfortunately, the people in the Cube though are just like me and you, they are people who have individual skills but have individual flaws and this prevents them seeing the woods for the trees. They are prisoners of the individually and socially constructed limits of imagination, they are prisoners of society and the cube is just a microcosm of this.I find it astonishing that so few people actually seem to understand this film.The clues throughout the film are abundant. Each of the characters' names represents a prison:Leaven + Worth = Fort Leavenworth Prison.Holloway = Women's Prison.Kazan = Prison for the mentally handicapped.Rennes = Prison that innovated many prison norms and regulations used today (Hence Renne's creativity in dealing with traps).Quentin = San Quentin, a prison known for it's brutality.Alderson = A prison that focuses on isolation as a form of punishment.Each of the characters has a skill that will help the group as a whole to escape but conversely each skill is tied to some character defect. Quentin is the leader (cop) who is also a bully when he doesn't get his way, Worth is, effectively, an insider who knows about the making of the Cube - he knows that there is no master plan or conspiracy but that the Cube is just a product of people like him who just do what they are told, accept a pay-cheque and don't want any trouble. Worth is not really that bothered about telling anyone else in the Cube because he is not really concerned as to whether he or anyone else escapes - he is indifferent, 'worthless'.Holloway cares for the mentally ill but shows no care or tact towards her peers.Wren is an escape artist but not interested in helping the others escape.Leaven is a pretty, young and brilliant Maths student but tends towards apathy.Kazan is a maths genius...perhaps...but has no ability to socialize (he is autistic).Alderson is a loner whose faith above reason destroys him very early on.The set of characters in the cube are bound by culturally constructed laws, rules and letters. There are 26(x26x26) rooms which may represent letters in the American-English alphabet. The rooms are all marked by 3-dimensional Cartesian co-ordinates (representing the limits of human spatial imagination). Traps in the rooms conform to a rule with respect to the particular coordinates and the prime numbers applicable to the 3-digit number.The Cube and the technological traps within thus represents western society as a product of technico-cultural evolution and the individuals inside are trapped by a) the limits of their imagination as represented by the Cube logic, as well as by b) their inability to cooperate.These two facets are the simultaneous products of historico-cultural evolution of western thought. The Cartesian perspective of ""I think, therefore I am"" projects a dualist, separatist view of the world - i am different and separate from that around me. This philosophy is, in itself, a product of the legacy of orthodox Christian theology - Christianity is at heart a religion that preaches separation and ego-centrism, e.g. I am special, if I behave i go to heaven, I have an inner-self which is in some sense separate from the material world.This perspective conflicts with Eastern philosophical doctrines such as Buddhism that emphasize instead the oneness of beings and the (physical and social) world around them. The inability of the individuals to apprehend the Cube's limitations (and thus be able to escape) is a manifestation of their own inability to throw off the shackles of their own personal and inherited socio-cultural history - they are born free but everywhere they are in chains. They are trapped by their own separatist identities, perceived failings, and ego-centrism.Furthermore, they are victims of being part of a society that rewards such separation. They are stuck in the ""Prisoner's Dilemma"" (Axelrod, 1984) - the simple premise is that cooperation can provide greater benefit than self-interested behaviour but only if others are willing to cooperate. If other fail to cooperate, it is better to be self-interested rather than a sucker.This is a frequency-dependent phenomenon meaning that if a majority decide to cooperate, then cooperation will pay and cheaters may even be punished so as to encourage cooperation - tight-knit Eastern societies such as those in Japan and China work along these principles.So, ultimately the individuals' skills are tied to their failings as this is all part and parcel of the separatist identity they have developed - an aspect of human nature that necessarily develops from infancy to adulthood in conjunction with basic self-consciousness and identity formation but has been prolonged into adulthood by a socio-cultural western tradition routed in Christian and Cartesian separatism and egocentrism.The prisoners' inability to recognize that they are just elements in a bigger dynamical system which doesn't render them worthless (a perceptual side-effect of egocentric excess) but rather necessary elements of the macro state, the group, accounts for their failure to escape - the irony being that the one escapee is the one that is indifferent to his fate and not bounded by the rules and regulations of the Cube so representative of the western socially constructed world.Through the overcoming of egocentrism the individuals have the potential to escape their personal prisons that the Cube represents and that is a manifestation of a symbolic, rule-based world in which they have developed - again a Christian legacy that has affected philosophical and scientific perspectives (e.g. information theory, gene-centrism, cognitivism) and governs western thinking to this day.From this escape they can unravel possibilities that may take them beyond the constraints of current western intellectual imagination and free them from the hell of a world that is bereft of executive instruction (whether from God, aliens, or human dictators) and is instead a socio-culturally evolved accident.Where such a liberated path might lead noone knows, but any path out of the inferno can't be bad, can it?",5,For people with an attention span,1224115200,"10 16, 2008",2008,6436,"['one', 'most', 'intelligent',

I was not disappointed:  it was executed incredibly well, and remained captivating and unpredictable throughout.What I really want to get into here is an analysis of what the movie meant.  Many have speculated, and I'd like to add my ideas.  First, it is important to note that, aside from the guy that gets offed in the opening scene, there are six characters in this movie, just as there are six sides to a cube.All of the characters are vastly different, and can be said to represent the human race.  The cube is a microcosm that represents the world.  Almost all of the characters have glaring fatal flaws:  the cop that's concerned with self-preservation and dominion over others, the amoral engineer, the paranoid doctor, and of course, a criminal.In addition, it helps to examine their names.  Characters like &quot;Leaven&quot; and &quot;Worth&quot; (&quot;Leavenworth&quot;) are suggestive of prisons, as is &quot;Quentin.&quot;  But there is also the doctor, &quot;Holloway&quot; (Hollow).Interestingly, despite the cube's many dangers, most of the deaths that occur are murders:  people killing people rather than the cube killing people.  In other words, despite this world's many natural dangers, mankind is its own worst enemy.  &quot;We are the cube,&quot; indeed.  The only character that is innocent and avoids all of the fighting done among the other characters is Kazan, who literally sees things differently from everyone else because of his autism.  He is the only one that escapes the cube, just as the only hope we have of avoiding destruction is to adapt a new worldview.A great film, entertaining, original, and thought-provoking, with a theme that is carried throughout without being weighed down by the narrative.",5,&quot;We are the cube&quot;,1054598400,"06 3, 2003",2003,1887,"['Just', 'get', 'way', ""'d"", 'like', 'say', 'was', 'expecting', 'much', 'movie', 'was', 'worried', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'falling', 'short', 'concept', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'was', 'executed', 'incredibly', 'well', 'remained', 'captivating', 'unpredictable', 'throughout.What', 'really', 'want', 'get', 'here', 'analysis', 'what', 'movie', 'meant', 'Many', 'have', 'speculated', ""'d"", 'like', 'add', 'ideas', 'First', 'important', 'note', 'aside', 'guy', 'offed', 'opening', 'scene', 'are', 'six', 'characters', 'movie', 'just', 'are', 'six', 'sides', 'cube.All', 'characters', 'are', 'vastly', 'different', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'represent', 'human', 'race', 'cube', 'microcosm', 'world', 'Almost', 'characters', 'have', 'glaring', 'fatal', 'flaws', 'cop', 'concerned', 'self-preservation', 'dominion', 'others', 'amoral', 'engineer', 'paranoid', 'doctor', 'course', 'criminal.In', 'addition', 'examine', 'names', 'Characters', 'quot', 'Leaven', 'quot', 'quot', 'Worth', 'quot', 'quot', 'Leavenworth', 'quot', 'are', 'suggestive', 'prisons', 'quot', 'Quentin.', 'quot', 'also', 'doctor', 'quot', 'Holloway', 'quot', 'Hollow', '.Interestingly', 'cube', 'many', 'dangers', 'most', 'deaths', 'occur', 'are', 'murders', 'people', 'killing', 'people', 'rather', 'cube', 'killing', 'people', 'other', 'words', 'world', 'many', 'natural', 'dangers', 'mankind', 'own', 'worst', 'enemy', 'quot', 'are', 'cube', 'quot', 'indeed', 'only', 'character', 'innocent', 'fighting', 'done', 'other', 'characters', 'Kazan', 'who', 'literally', 'things', 'differently', 'everyone', 'else', 'autism', 'only', 'one', 'cube', 'just', 'only', 'hope', 'have', 'avoiding', 'destruction', 'adapt', 'new', 'worldview.A', 'great', 'film', 'entertaining', 'original', 'thought-provoking', 'theme', 'carried', 'being', 'weighed', 'down', 'narrative']",Cube

I saw this movie a while back, and have always put off writing a review on it, even though it happens to be my favorite movie of all time. But tonight, I feel I should express the reasoning behind my maddness. Not that there is a reason exactly. I would say, either people love this movie or they hate it. I admit, the acting quality is poor, but it doesn't take away from the movie much because the characters the actors portray come across as being very believable and real. I mean, how would YOU act if you woke up in a CUBE and didn't know how you got there, or why you were there?? Hmm??? Yeah thats what I thought. You'd be a little disoriented too. :) I liked this movie mainly because of its originality and the fact that the entire movie was filmed in one room (cube). That's just incredible. It reminds me a lot of dreams I have. I have it on DVD and I have probably seen it, oh, maybe 100 times in the past year. You'd think that since I know what happens in the end that it would be pointless to keep watching it, but I just love the movie so much. It's got intelligence, mystery, humor (Is that your 2-cents worth, Worth? For what it's worth...) It's just an all around interesting and intriguing movie that will definitely have an impact on you.

455473,A2LZJ4XJS1A9XM,6305238065,"Amazon Customer ""nospam""","[3, 3]","This film illustrates one of the defining (to me) notions of art - the mastery of a small, elegant skill set. For example - chess mastery is a great art because the number of moves and rules in chess is small, while the number of possible games are almost incomputably large. This self-described &quot;action&quot; film was made on a shoestring, with a one-and-one-half room set, 7 actors and a very few special effects shots. Within this framework, the filmmakers managed to create an engaging, very suspenseful film. The characterizations tend toward the iconic rather than the individual, but different sides of the &quot;iconic&quot; personalities are developed.  For example, the strong, alpha-male character being alternately strong and protective and violent and bullying. Some of the subtext (and indeed, the text) is self-consciously &quot;political&quot; in a way that navel-gazers might find compelling. Your Reviewer finds the use of  politically loaded terms like &quot;military-industrial complex&quot; in filmic dialog pretentious and mood-spoiling, inviting as it does reflexive identification in the audience with or against a character or characters, thus reducing characters to stereotypes and audience members to constituencies. The strong acting, however, keeps audience sympathy. This really pays off because the lack of  a &quot;big name&quot; star left the writers free to kill off any of the characters at any time, raising the stakes and the suspense beyond most mainstream films. For this, I forgive speechifying and occasional lapses (okay, just one REALLY BAD lapse near the end) into Hollywood-style schlock-shocks. The overall premise of the film, however, obeys the greatest dramatic law (IMHO), in that it obeys its own rules - and those rules involve some pretty hefty math, which the producers give the audience credit enough to comprehend. Most Hollwood films can't even keep their own rules. This film does. Well shot, good production values, acceptable characterizations and dialog, and well-developed, suspensful plot makes this a definite should-see film, especially for aspiring filmmakers. I know Blockbuster stocks this film, and NOBODY rents it.  Be one of the few and check it out.  Oh - also of note, the commentary track is excellent.

455474,A3EFGZBIKEZBL0,6305238065,Andrei Pankov,"[17, 18]","Just because filmmakers of the Cube, having a low budget, filmed it in a single room doesn't mean that it is a B sci-fi.  To tell the truth I have  never seen a plot so original as in Cube.  Some may think that it is boring  to watch; I have to disagre with anyone who dislikes Cube because it is one  intelligent creation that leaves us, attentive viwers, in a deep  contemplative mood and with a long lasting impression.  Cube is unique  bcause it provides insights into human behavior.  It is the movie that  shows how several strangers deal with a dangerous situation and a position  where they need to learn to cooperate in order to survive.The plot is  simple but unusual.  A small group of strangers found themselves in a death  trap or an extremely elaborate labyrinth of interconnected cubical rooms  with lethal traps in some of them.  Different rooms that are traps contain  from elector-molecular to sound sensors and are equipped with either deadly  flame-throwers, razor sharp knives that protrude through walls, acid sprays  or something else that can brutally dismember an unsuspecting victim.  At  first there seems no order and no leads as were to go and how to avoid a  trap for our characters, which results in panic and despair.  But as time  passes they discover that pattern exists and there is a reason why  specifically each one of them is here.  There happen to be a math genius,  engineer, doctor and few other interesting individuals.  Together they try  to find a way out, and just when it seemed that they understand how the  maze is structured there comes a surprise and a disappointment with another  dose of despair.  The labyrinth is much more complicated than it appears  and it will take a huge mental and physical effort to solve it.Without a  doubt Cube is a brilliant film with a unique idea.  I want to warn everyone  that it is extremely intense and scary at times.  I also want to point out  that people with decent math background, or someone who likes math, will  find it especially enjoying because it will be easier to understand how the  puzzling trap was solved, and the exit found.",5,Brilliant story filmed in a Single Room !,964396800,"07 24, 2000",2000,2130,"['Just', 'filmmakers', 'Cube', 'having', 'low', 'budget', 'filmed', 'single', 'room', ""n't"", 'mean', 'B', 'sci-fi', 'tell', 'truth', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'plot', 'so', 'original', 'Cube', 'may', 'think', 'boring', 'watch', 'have', 'disagre', 'anyone', 'who', 'Cube', 'one', 'intelligent', 'creation', 'attentive', 'viwers', 'deep', 'contemplative', 'mood', 'long', 'lasting', 'impression', 'Cube', 'unique', 'insights', 'human', 'behavior', 'movie', 'how', 'several', 'strangers', 'deal', 'dangerous', 'situation', 'position', 'where', 'need', 'learn', 'cooperate', 'order', 'survive.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'unusual', 'A', 'small', 'group', 'strangers', 'found', 'death', 'trap', 'extremely', 'elaborate', 'labyrinth', 'interconnected', 'cubical', 'rooms', 'lethal', 'traps', 'Different', 'rooms', 'are', 'traps', 'contain', 'elector-molecular', 'sound', 'sensors', 'are', 'equipped', 'deadly', 'flame-throwers', 'razor', 'sharp', 'knives', 'protrude', 'walls', 'acid', 'sprays', 'something', 'else', 'can', 'brutally', 'dismember', 'unsuspecting', 'victim', 'first', 'order', 'leads', 'were', 'go', 'how', 'avoid', 'trap', 'characters', 'results', 'panic', 'despair', 'time', 'discover', 'pattern', 'reason', 'why', 'specifically', 'one', 'here', 'happen', 'be', 'math', 'genius', 'engineer', 'doctor', 'few', 'other', 'interesting', 'individuals', 'Together', 'try', 'find', 'way', 'just', 'when', 'seemed', 'understand', 'how', 'maze', 'structured', 'surprise', 'disappointment', 'dose', 'despair', 'labyrinth', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'will', 'take', 'huge', 'mental', 'physical', 'effort', 'solve', 'it.Without', 'doubt', 'Cube', 'brilliant', 'film', 'unique', 'idea', 'want', 'warn', 'everyone', 'extremely', 'intense', 'scary', 'times', 'also', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'people', 'decent', 'math', 'background', 'someone', 'who', 'math', 'will', 'find', 'especially', 'enjoying', 'will', 'be', 'easier', 'understand', 'how', 'puzzling', 'trap', 'was', 'solved', 'exit', 'found']",Cube
455475,A2O7MOWVMSKO5J,6305238065,Andy Gill,"[0, 1]","This is another film which allows for different experiences on subsequent viewings, making it hard to come up with an answer to the question: what's it like? What can be said is that it is highly intelligent, very imaginative story-telling, low-budget, but not suffering because of this, and deservedly fitting into a category all of its own. It is also cheesy, beautifully overblown, and is sure to become a camp classic.The first time you see it, Cube is a remarkable stroke of genius. Every minute is filled with tension to the extent that it becomes almost unbearable to watch. The possibilities of the environment the filmmakers have created far exceeds what you would normally expect from a sci-fi, and the amount they are able to draw out of what is essentially a character-driven `rat-in-a-maze' story is applaudable. But - and it's a big but - the second time you watch it, you start to notice how over-the-top the performances are. This isn't to the detriment of the film, but makes it a totally different movie. Gone is the tension and ingenuity, and in its place are a number of actors hamming it up to perfection, and enticing you to laughter every time their various neuroses blow up in their faces - the paranoid, the psychotic, the nihilist. The actor who plays the autistic character has definitely watched Rainman one time too often, and Leaven flits between chronic fear and rampant bitchiness so many times it's high entertainment. It makes you cheer, laugh, and thoroughly enjoy a film that it is clear the filmmakers had great fun making. At least, I hope that was their intention, because if they are playing it straight, as a serious film, something went seriously awry along the way!Overall, Cube is a great film to watch, as something tense and entirely original, or as something just to laugh with and enjoy. Sometimes you do wish that more people had been caught in the traps, just to see what other ideas the filmmakers had in their bag of tricks, but that is not something upon which to criticise the film. There is something for everyone in Cube, so don't be put off by its science-fiction classification. Even my mother liked it.

It's a real milestone at least in horror genre. It's not that often when we get a chance to come across such a talented independent film that shakes our imagination and makes to look at the genre with a fresh eye. I think if we start recalling such titles, we won't recall many. But for some reason, you know, ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is still remembered by many and some other pretty decent flicks are not. I guess ""Cube"" will be remembered.It unfolds as a group of people, total strangers, find themselves in some odd place - it's a room which has four doors in the walls, one in a ceiling and one in the floor. Every door leads to another room which is identical to the previous one - other 6 doors. More to it - some rooms contain deadly traps... And what just that might mean?!Although the story-line itself is very intriguing and intense that makes this film a perfect suspence thriller, the creators managed not to spoil everything in the end like it usually happens. They offered us a finale which was mellow, which suited the whole movie and didn't even try to ruin the picture.From this point of view I was extremely disappointed in the second and third parts of ""Cube"" which were limp and impotent. If you haven't watched them, don't even bother - I'm sure your life as a cinema-fan will be much better without them. And regarding the first and only ""Cube"" - it's a must I'd say.

No one knows what happened, how they get inside that strange place... they don't even have an idea that the building is a cube. They only know that they're trapped in rare habitations (blue, red, green ones) and that some of the rooms have mortal traps.  They have two choices: Try to escape or stand where they are and wait for something to happen.The situation get complex. The claustrophobia and the proximity of death begin to affect the inhabitants of the building.  The true personalities begin to afflorate.

It is about 6 people from different backgrounds who wake up one day to find themselves locked in a room (Cube) with six doors leading to other rooms. Each room has some sort of hidden mechanical torture device. The movie is about why what and how. The Cube.. who built it? Why were they thrown there? How to escape?

Since Hollywood is rightly accused of just churning out the same movies just with a different face, in comes films that you've probably never seen before and it becomes memorable simply because you can't think of another like it. So we have Cube, shot in Canada and it has a familiar plot but an innovative concept and is actually really intriguing despite the fact we never leave the same room.A group of people: Quentin, Renne, Leaven, Kazan, Worth and Holloway find themselves trapped in an unusual place: a cube-shaped room with doors on either end. Not told why they're there or by whom and they notice something else: some of the rooms have traps and these are nasty lethal traps so the 6 have to figure out a way to get out, if there is a way out.That's basically the story in a nutshell but you're surprised that it never seems to get old. The filmmakers used one room but with different color panels for red room, blue room and so on so we literally never leave the same room but there's enough in the story to keep you hooked. There's even a tense scene involving a sound-activated trap that's quite harrowing. If there's one thing I hate to mark a fault to is the reliance of math. When you have cartography points and factors, prime numbers and dimensions involving axis you feel like your head's going to spin. Luckily, they cast a sexy female to do the thinking so even if you have no clue what she's saying, she looks cute saying it. Then again, I was always a sucker for smart babes in glasses.But the acting spot does take a hit. The characters are actually named after prisons and so we have basically one-dimensional characters. We have the psycho-in-training, the mentally challenged, the sexy nerd, the quiet hero, the nervous older woman and the ""I know best"" older man. But in the end we start to like certain characters because we gravitate towards that kind of person so me obviously I like the sexy chick while others might go for the quiet hero. It's strange that we almost never seem to leave the characters yet they ddon't develop all that much.It may not win awards for acting and it probably won't be in your top ten films ever but it's kind of a film that's hard to forget too.",4,innovating yet familiar but really neat too,1172448000,"02 26, 2007",2007,2280,"['One', 'film', 'Cube', 'kind', 'breath', 'sigh', 'relief', 'Hollywood', 'rightly', 'accused', 'just', 'churning', 'out', 'same', 'movies', 'just', 'different', 'face', 'films', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'never', 'seen', 'memorable', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'Cube', 'shot', 'Canada', 'familiar', 'plot', 'innovative', 'concept', 'actually', 'really', 'intriguing', 'fact', 'never', 'leave', 'same', 'room.A', 'group', 'people', 'Quentin', 'Renne', 'Leaven', 'Kazan', 'Worth', 'Holloway', 'find', 'trapped', 'unusual', 'place', 'cube-shaped', 'room', 'doors', 'end', 'Not', 'told', 'why', ""'re"", 'whom', 'notice', 'something', 'else', 'rooms', 'have', 'traps', 'are', 'nasty', 'lethal', 'traps', '6', 'have', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'out.That', 'basically', 'story', 'nutshell', ""'re"", 'surprised', 'never', 'get', 'old', 'filmmakers', 'used', 'one', 'room', 'different', 'color', 'panels', 'red', 'room', 'blue', 'room', 'so', 'literally', 'never', 'leave', 'same', 'room', 'enough', 'story', 'keep', 'hooked', 'even', 'tense', 'scene', 'involving', 'sound-activated', 'trap', 'quite', 'harrowing', 'one', 'thing', 'hate', 'mark', 'fault', 'reliance', 'math', 'When', 'have', 'cartography', 'points', 'factors', 'prime', 'numbers', 'dimensions', 'involving', 'axis', 'feel', 'head', 'going', 'spin', 'Luckily', 'cast', 'sexy', 'female', 'do', 'thinking', 'so', 'even', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'saying', 'cute', 'saying', 'Then', 'again', 'was', 'always', 'sucker', 'smart', 'babes', 'glasses.But', 'acting', 'spot', 'take', 'hit', 'characters', 'are', 'actually', 'named', 'prisons', 'so', 'have', 'basically', 'one-dimensional', 'characters', 'have', 'psycho-in-training', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'sexy', 'nerd', 'quiet', 'hero', 'nervous', 'older', 'woman', 'know', 'best', 'older', 'man', 'end', 'start', 'like', 'certain', 'characters', 'gravitate', 'towards', 'kind', 'person', 'obviously', 'like', 'sexy', 'chick', 'others', 'might', 'go', 'quiet', 'hero', 'strange', 'almost', 'never', 'seem', 'leave', 'characters', 'yet', 'ddo', ""n't"", 'develop', 'much.It', 'may', 'not', 'win', 'awards', 'acting', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'top', 'ten', 'films', 'ever', 'kind', 'film', 'hard', 'forget', 'too']",Cube

455498,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6305238065,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[110, 123]","I like cubes...ice cubes, sugar cubes, beef bouillabaisse cubes, Rubik's Cubes (am I sound a bit like Forrest Gump?).  So here we have a movie called Cube (1997).  Actually, I purchased this a while ago, and since watched it a few times, but never got around to writing a review on it...until today.  Directed and co-written by Vincenzo Natali (his first film), Cube has a relatively small cast featuring Nicole de Boer (Prom Night IV: Deliver Us from Evil), Nicky Guadagni (Storm of the Century-the TV mini-series, not the film), David Hewlett (Chasing Cain), Maurice Dean Wint (TekWar), Andrew Miller (Last of the Dogmen), and Wayne Robson (Cold Creek Manor).  What that's?  You've never heard of any of these actors?  Well, neither did I, but then given the relatively low budget (well under $500,000) of this Canadian feature, I wasn't expecting Brad Pitt (or even his lesser known brother Stu Pitt...geddit?  Stu Pitt?  Ah well...)As the story begins (the first scene is a hoot!), we witness a small group of rather disorientated people, dressed in prison-like garb, coming together within small, square room.  They have no idea how they got there, or why, and have never met each other before now.  We learn the intricately designed room is a cube, one of many, and each cube has six doors (one on each wall, along with the ceiling and the floor), each door leading to another cube.  Also, some of the cubes contain lethal traps (acid, razor wire, flamethrowers, etc.) activated by a variety of different types of sensors.  This just keeps getting better and better...as we meet the various members of this small group, we find out that each person seems to have a particular talent, and what first appeared to be just a random grouping of people throw into a wacky death maze, now seems to be something more...like each was picked for his or her specific talents.  Well, that's seems like good news to the group, but the bad news is the pressures and the stress (along with a pinch of paranoia) threaten to tear the band of unfortunates apart, just as surely as the traps within the cube.  As this plucky assemblage moves from room to room, they do find a pattern for orientation of the cubes, but is it one that will lead them to an exit?  Or will it lead them to an acid soaked, sliced and diced, charbroiled demise?  You'll just have to watch and see...Alright, I will say this...the acting isn't that great, and the script and delivery of the dialog feels extremely clunky at times, but I was impressed and entertained with the originality of the story.  As far as the story goes, we know as much about the situation the characters are in as they do, and learn things as they learn them, essentially putting the viewer in the cube, but without the possibly nastiness of suffering one of those ouchy traps.  This will upset, frustrate, and even anger some viewers as people generally like to be in the know, like to have things explained, and need a reason for why things are...but I feel everything doesn't have to have a reason, and I don't need everything presented to me in easily digestible chunks.  The film offers little to nothing in the way of what the cube is, its' purpose, or why these individuals were chosen to be placed inside.  Also, the ending is purposely vague, as to coincide with the rest of the story.  This sort of reminds me of Patrick McGoohan's popular Prisoner TV series...when it ended, some people were outraged at the ambiguousness of the ending, as they were looking for answers and yet few were forthcoming.  I thought the direction was tight as Natali manages to keep things moving along.  The set's pretty minimal, as they used the same cubed room over and over, but did give it the appearance of a different room by changing the colors.  Nearly the entire film takes place in this cube, except for some scenes featuring some low budget, but decent CGI work.One should be aware, as another reviewer pointed out, that there are (at this time) two different releases of this film on DVD.  The one being sold here now is the new Signature Edition (the director's siggy is on the front), and released by Lions Gate Entertainment.  The original DVD was released by Trimark, and has a slightly different cover.  The newer release features a new anamorphic transfer with a new Dolby Digital 5.1 audio mix (Amazon has yet to update the DVD features on this product page).  The Trimark release special features include Dolby Digital 2.0 audio, deleted scenes, comparative and alternate storyboards, production designs, set designs, special effects artwork, and a commentary featuring the director, actor Hewlett, and co-writer Andre Bijelic.  The Lions Gate version has many same features (except the set design material and the voice over commentary on the deleted scenes), along with an interview with actress Nicole de Boer, and cleaned up menus.  Also, they replaced the original commentary track with one featuring only the director.  I mention this as if you are going to buy this used, make sure you get the version you want, either the original Trimark release or this new Lions Gate Signature release as there are differences, although the film is essentially the same.  After reading many of the reviews, I see there are basically two opinions, those who really like the film, and those who hate it, suckered into watching it due to the good reviews.  Well, I enjoyed the film, despite its' obvious flaws, but to those of you who have yet to see it, rent it first.  For those interested, due to the popularity of this film in the realm of home video, a sequel called Cube 2:Hypercube (2002) was released.  It's slicker than the original, not quite as good, but maybe worth a look if you liked this one.Cookieman108",4,Don't Look For A Reason...

Slipman,"[2, 2]","Director Vincenzo Natali's ""Cube"" is a Canadian produced claustrophobic fantasy where a group of total strangers awaken to find themselves imprisoned in a gigantic manmade ostensibly ineludible cubic maze.  They soon discover that each possess skills that can enable them to negotiate themselves out of this trap composed of interconnected cubic rooms.  To make matters worse some of the rooms are booby trapped in a deadly fashion.The group is led by Quentin, a crazed obsessed cop played by Maurice Dean Wint.  He is greatly aided by brilliant mathematician Leaven played by Nicole de Boer who discovers that the way out is based on complex mathematical permutations.  Quentin's whipping boy and voice of reason of the group is Worth played by David Hewlett who amazingly was part of the architectural group responsible for the construction of the cube.In the absence of food and water a timely escape from the cube is of the essence.  As they begin meandering from room to room, fear and paranoia set in and the group begins to splinter into chaos.  A revealing set of interactions between the trapped group is startlingly portrayed as desperation sets in.

The cell is 14 foot on each side and there is a hatch one each of the four walls and on the floor and ceiling, each leading to another identical cell. You have to find your way out of the complex before you die of thirst, but your way is beset by lethal (and rather gruesome) boobytraps and the rising tensions and in-fighting between your companions.Like other reviewers, I first caught this film several years ago on the sci-fi channel. At first glance, it doesn't have a lot going for it. There are no big name stars and the acting ranges from average to thickly-sliced ham, although Andrew Miller turns a fairly convincing Rain Man performance as a mentally challenged savant. The plot is linear in the extreme; the initial tension the viewer feels quickly evaporates as the prisoners discover that the traps can be avoided by reading clues in the rooms' serial numbers (which also provide a handy escape route clue) or by the simple expedient of chucking their boots into the next room before entering.In its favour, the set is certainly striking despite (or because of?) the low budget and sparse SFX. I mean how much would you need to spend on a set that (probably) comprised of one or two identical prison cells? It was, however, the /concept/ that captivated me when I first saw the film. The idea of being trapped in an apparently endless series of cells, some benign, some designed to kill in the nastiest of ways, resonated with my worst nightmares. It's a concept that richly deserves further exploration (and it got that in two sequels of mixed quality). Who built it? Why? What were the prisoners guilty of ? Why the booby traps and why the escape clues? Certainly the origin of the prison is a huge elephant in the room and the prisoners speculate about it (one is even revealed to have been a clueless sub-sub-sub-contractor in its design) but in the end the film never ventures outside the confines of this construct and the questions are left hanging. That ambiguity is probably the film's greatest strength.Unfortunately, though, it's not quite enough to raise the film far above the parapet of ordinariness. Once you've experienced the environment and discovered that there are no answers, all you are left with is the group dynamic - the rising tensions, the allegiances, treachery and violence and, as I mentioned the ""could-do-better"" acting doesn't quite manage to set fire. Having seen the film once and been captivated, the second viewing came as a bit of a disappointment.Nevertheless, this is a good film - well worth one or two viewings. The DVD is no longer in print and it seems that different sellers have different pressings.

455505,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,6305238065,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[2, 6]","Imagine this: you went to sleep, soundly, in your own bed. Hard day, harder night: drinking, carousing, maybe; maybe you curled up after a stressful day and an even more stressful commute with a good book, and sleep came crashing down. Whatever; past is prologue, and prologue here doesn't mean much.You wake up in a cubic room. It's about 20 feet by 20 feet. In the center of each cubic face---even on the ceiling---is a hatch. You're clad in a prison-style grey smock, with your name stenciled gulag-style above the right nipple, and when you have slightly recovered from the initial shock (where am I? Is this a dream? What do I have to do to get back to the real world? Where do I poop?), you amble dazedly over to the hatch on the left and give the submarine-style airlock door a turn. It comes open, and gazing through the aperture, you spy---another Cubic room, that looks just like yours.That's ""Cube"", a vicious little puzzlebox of horror and delight from Vincenzo Natali. It's brilliantly simple, conceptually engaging, brutally compelling.The opening sequence, for instance: a man opening up a hatch, shinnying through it, setting foot in the new Cube Room---and then a noise that sounds like a butterfly farting, and the man---Alderson---goes rigid, his body frozen in place in a living rictus, eyes wide, a true Kodak moment for just a split second. And then, an instant later---Nah, I won't ruin it for you. Suffice it to say that the Cubes contain death traps---well, some of them. We meet the heroes, chiefly, as they meet each other: somebody opens up a hatch and peers through, only to find one, or two other prisoners, clad in grey smocks, equally bewildered by their twisted predicament: Math student Leaven (Nicole de Boer), architect David Worth (David Hewlett), rugged cop Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint), Dr. Helen Holloway (Nicky Guadagni), Autistic Kazan (Andrew Miller),escape-artist Rennes (Wayne Robson). In whole or part, the names of our players are prisons: Leaven and Worth, Kazan (a notorious Russian labor camp), Holloway, even (San) Quentin. None of them have anything obvious in common, apart from their mysterious confinement.  Oh yeah, and those prison names.Spooky.Frankly, when I first saw Cube I hadn't heard anything about it; I knew what the idea was, roughly, and I had seen the first five minutes on HBO.  That five minutes alone sold me.  But aside from techno-bloodletting, I wasn't expecting much from Cube.As a result, Cube snuck up behind me, banged me in the skull with a blackjack, locked me in a cube full of cubes, and made off with my socks (leaving me my shoes so I could check the rooms for traps).  Director Vincenzo Natali (who did not direct the second installment---and it shows) keeps the storyline a taut tripwire of paranoia, makes the most of his spare set, pumps up the tension with solid acting all around, and ices the cake with some deranged little engines of destruction (all fitted nattily into those deceptively harmless looking little cubes) that would make a Hellraiser Cenobite giggle with delight.Natali dumps his ingredients into this deadly steel cauldron, stirs the brew up, and brings it to a boil by milking the tension between the characters as they struggle to understand their plight and---more importantly---to get out of the Cube.  Best of all, he punctuates the internal struggle between a group of people who don't know and don't trust each other, but need to work together nonetheless, with shrieks of wanton, and totally unpredictable, carnage.I'm a pretty adventurous guy, and I've never been one to put my horror movie cannon fodder through something I wouldn't do myself---that's no way to treat the Troops!  But this time, watching these frail, highly perishable, lightly clad, completely defenseless men and women carefully testing out an unknown cube, checking with shoes for hidden pressure plates, ever alert for shifts in the atmosphere---perhaps an acid spray, perhaps a serrated spinning whirly-blade of death, maybe a floor to ceiling Mach-8 speed cheese grater---you truly appreciate how puny human flesh really is, how easily it can be mangled.  You get tense yourself just watching; too many times I thought ""better them than me"". Brrr.Natali succeeds by keeping Cube simple: without much exposition and with absolutely no clue as to what lies outside the interlocking cubes---if anything---we have to know the characters from what they tell each other, and the environment from what the characters see.  Getting out is not only vital, but seemingly impossible: the gang can't simply cross horizontally from Cube to Cube until they reach the ""outer Cube Wall"", because death trap rooms bar their way---as a number of hapless---and unwitting---human mine detectors prove.Who would do something as vile as this?, they wonder.  Why us?  And to what purpose?  And do the series of numbers---what appear to be serial numbers, actually---hold any clue to working out how to get out of here?  As it turns out, the Cube isn't the only thing in this flick with secrets.In the end, Cube provides a little something for the whole family: the bloodthirsty gorehound will spend a giddy 90 minutes punctuated by constant bursts of ""Oh Hell yes!"", while those more intrigued by the colossal mystery of the fiendish cubic puzzlebox will walk away sated.  And for those who dread more than anything else having to wake up Monday morning hung over, alarm clock blaring, a tedious commute yielding up only another agonizing week of work---rejoice!  Cube proves it could always be much worse.JSG",4,Gleaming the Cube,1105920000,"01 17, 2005",2005,5577,"['Imagine', 'went', 'sleep', 'soundly', 'own', 'bed', 'Hard', 'day', 'harder', 'night',

The whole set-up of the film is rather imaginative, and one of the joys of the film is watching the characters figure out how to navigate this shifting maze without getting killed in gruesome fashion.  One of the other pleasures of the film is the visuals and special effects-- for a low-budget film, the sets look damn good (especially considering the difficulties they had making this-- the commentary on the making of it is almost as interesting as the film itself).On the negative side, the script succumbs to the cliche of having the characters fight amonst themselves for no other reason than to generate conflict.  Others have faulted the acting and dialogue, but I don't think those aspects were that detrimental.  More importantly, however, the film lacks the existential weight that would have given a real Kafkaesque tone to the situation, so that the ending-- evocative though it is-- leaves one feeling slightly cheated.

The cinematography was well done, and the writing was mostly good, but some of the acting was weak. I found Nicky Guadagni's (Holloway) acting to be pretty heavy handed, and unnatural. And Maurice Dean Wint (Quentin) delivered a few labored lines. But the rest of the cast was good.The film makes use of only one set, an empty cubical room. The actors are inexplicably trapped in an enormous, and complex series of these cube rooms. Some rooms are booby trapped, while others are safe. The only variables are the numerical codes placed at the entrances to each cube. The characters use these to navigate through the maze, and hopefully to find the way out.Cube has suspense, originality, modest action, and emotion. So for that I give it four out of five stars.

455509,A10HMPPHWI3V0A,6305238065,"dddddsssss ""gggogogog""","[2, 3]","After reading the very positive reveiws of this late 90's thriller I decided that it deserved at least a rental. I must confess that I am glad that I happened to stumble upon this movie on Amazon because it was everything that a horror movie should be. The Screenplay was very put together, the plot & setting were intriguing yet mysterious & the killings (Or cinematography if you want to make it sound all fancy) & visuals are quite impressive for it's 500,000$ dollar budget. Now, the only real complaint that I can say about the film is that the acting is horrid. Now dont get me wrong not ALL of the acting was that bad but I would be lying if I said that most of the actors were okay, the truth is that most of them had very little experience and THAT made the film look all-around quite a bit less professional and hard to look at as an ELITE horror film. I think that if the producers would have known when they made the film that it would do so well and have such great reveiws and number of veiwers than they would have been more than willing to dish out the few extra bucks in order to have some more experienced actors.I thought that David Hewlett played David Worth (The Architect) acceptably and I also thought that Nicky Guadagni's performance as Helen Halloway (the Doctor) was pretty good. Other than those two I thought that the acting was very lightweight. The guy that played Quentin (the cop) was really bad which was quite a shame just because that characte had a big role in the film and was really important ... also I thought that they could have gotten a better and more experienced guy to play the role of the Autistic boy (or man it was some what hard to tell...).I know that I keep going on and on about the acting but I cant wonder away from the truth to much. The concept and idea of the film was really quite brilliant, the screnplay was brilliantly written and the story line meshed with extrodinary ease.

455512,A2198FZZMTJ38H,6305238065,D. Litton,"[0, 3]","In the world of independent horror, &quot;Cube&quot; ranks as a success and a failure. The production value of the film is much more sophisticated and expensive, but with the banal characterization, lugubrious dialogue and a complete absence of tension or suspense, it becomes morose and draggy, a time-waster that fails to deliver much of anything.The film opens with a disturbing scene in which a man, trapped in a square room with a single door on each wall, enters into another room and becomes divided into identical pieces. As we leave this grotesque scene, we enter another room, where a group of people are waking up to find themselves trapped in a maze, with time running against them as they must find their way to the outer shell of the superstructure and escape before dying from malnourishment.The individuals among them are not that intriguing: there's edgy cop Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint), who takes charge of their quest; Worth (David Hewlett), who knows more about the structure than he's willing to tell; Leaven (Nicole de Boer), whose skills in mathematics serve to help them find which rooms are safe; Holloway (Nicky Guadagni), part humanitarian, part feminist; and a retard who causes more trouble than he prevents.Throughout the course of this bland story, the dialogue serves little other purpose than to give us the illusion that something interesting is at hand. From a convoluted explanation for the cube's existence to the various stages of schizophrenia that begin to warp their minds as they find one another unbearable, there is nothing that ever really grabs our attention.The so-called action itself is never quite action, either, composed primarily of our group making their way through the rooms, solving different puzzles only to be perplexed by new ones, and a few incidental and purposeful deaths that aren't shocking, only ludicrous due to the fact that the story sets each one character up to live or die before the end comes.

455515,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,6305238065,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 2]","""Cube"" is a cult hit. That basically means that it's good or innovative, but not many people know about it.Vincenzo Natali (also creator of ""Cypher"" and ""Nothing"") made his full-length directorial debut with this film -- a low-budet, innovative sci-thriller that feels like an episode of the ""Twilight Zone,"" as written by Mark Danielewski and Franz Kafka. Yes, it's that surreal -- and that intelligent and well-written.Seven people have been placed in a cubical room, which is connected to a bizarre maze of thousands more. Among are a cop, a disabled man, an architect, a student, a doctor and a criminal, and all of them have wildly disparate personalities. But they soon learn that behind the countless doors, there are deadly booby-traps.So of course, their chances of survival don't seem so good. But they soon learn that their placement in the Cube is no accident -- each one has skills that the group needs. To escape, they will have to band together and use their brains. But why are they in the Cube in the first place -- and is the maze even the same as when they started?Vincenzo Natali's ""Cube"" is a perfect example of what Hollywood can't seem to grasp -- it doesn't matter how much money is poured into a movie, because it's the concept, brains and skill that make it good or bad. Not the special effects or the big names.And Natali did a magnificent job with his first full-length movie, infusing what seems to be a straightforward thriller with a taut, claustrophobic atmosphere, and some ominous hints about morality (or the lack of it) and sociology. It also has an unusually intelligent script, with prime numbers and their powers playing a big part, right next to the gruesome deaths. And of course, the solid dialogue. (""You've got a gift."" ""It's not a gift. It's just a brain."")At the heart of the creepiness: Natali only reveals the secrets of the Cube as they are revealed to the characters, which adds to the suspense. What is this thing? Why are they in it? We know as much as they do. And we're only going to find out more about it when they do.It's also a movie that bothers to have real characters. No screaming teens here -- the movie's plot depends on them being very different. Natali and Andr&eacute; Bijelic reveal the characters through their action and dialogue -- some are whiny, some are cruel, and some are just annoying. Some of the acting is rather flat, and a few of the arguments ring hollow, but overall it's very like watching real people.Vincenzo Natali's ""Cube"" gives a good name to shoestring budgets and eerie plots.

455516,A34O1FHEAN9DN6,6305238065,E. Beckstrom,"[0, 0]","The first and, by far, best of three (so far) Cube movies. The story is essentially a movie-length rendition of an episode of the original Twilight Zone series, ""Five Characters in Search of an Exit."" The acting and character arcs are effective and satisfying, as are the sets, score, and editing. The script is surprisingly literate, and well-developed in terms of both action and ideas--a perfect blend. The story is an existential nightmare: a number of people wake up in a cube-shaped room that they learn is one among thousands which in turn comprise one gigantic cube. Each room has a hatch on every side. Some lead to other ""safe"" cubes; some lead to death. The occupants have no recollection of where they are, how they got there, or why they are there. What characteristics does each of them possess that will help or hinder their attempt to escape? Who among them is a friend, and who can't be trusted? In what direction should they go, and which door leads to freedom? In this movie, the latter question is both practical and philosophical. Pure action fans, don't worry: This is a very fast-paced, exciting movie. At the same time, those interested in thought-provoking action/sci-fi will have much to ponder as well.The script's key strength is that it provides no pat answers to the where / how / why of the characters' dilemma. But the script's ambiguity is artful; it is not the kind of cop-out ambiguity in which many lesser movies indulge when the production team either lacks skill, doesn't know how to effectively develop ideas, wants to tack on an ""artsy""  ending, or is making way for a sequel. By contrast, Cube's conclusion is striking, and not merely a gimmick.The problems noted above indicate the many weaknesses of the other two Cube movies. The first Cube is a great stand-alone film. The sequels provide too many answers, too much unnecessary gore (especially Cube Zero). Thus, they retroactively ruin the first movie in the series. I don't inherently dislike sequels--only when they cast a shadow on their predecessors. I also don't inherently dislike gore; but, if one judges by the first movie in the series, gore really doesn't represent what Cube is about. Cube Zero (the third in the series) also has a silly self-parody component which conflicts with the tone of the series as a whole.Bottom line: Watch the first Cube and avoid the rest.",4,Well-done in terms of both action and ideas,1191369600,"10 3, 2007",2007,2375,"['first', 'far', 'best', 'three', 'so', 'far', 'Cube', 'movies', 'story', 'essentially', 'movie-length', 'rendition', 'episode', 'original', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'series', 'Five', 'Characters', 'Search', 'Exit', 'acting', 'character', 'arcs', 'are', 'effective', 'satisfying', 'are', 'sets', 'score', 'editing', 'script', 'surprisingly', 'literate', 'well-developed', 'terms', 'action', 'ideas', 'perfect', 'blend', 'story', 'existential', 'nightmare', 'number', 'people', 'wake', 'up', 'cube-shaped', 'room', 'learn', 'one', 'thousands', 'turn', 'comprise', 'one', 'gigantic', 'cube', 'room', 'hatch', 'side', 'lead', 'other', 'safe', 'cubes', 'lead', 'death', 'occupants', 'have', 'recollection', 'where', 'are', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'why', 'are', 'there', 'What', 'characteristics', 'possess', 'will', 'help', 'hinder', 'attempt', 'escape', 'Who', 'friend', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'trusted', 'what', 'direction', 'should', 'go', 'door', 'freedom', 'movie', 'latter', 'question', 'practical', 'philosophical', 'Pure', 'action', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'very', 'fast-paced', 'exciting', 'movie', 'same', 'time', 'interested', 'thought-provoking', 'action/sci-fi', 'will', 'have', 'much', 'ponder', 'well.The', 'script', 'key', 'strength', 'pat', 'answers', 'where', '/', 'how', '/', 'why', 'characters', 'dilemma', 'script', 'ambiguity', 'artful', 'not', 'kind', 'cop-out', 'ambiguity', 'many', 'lesser', 'movies', 'indulge', 'when', 'production', 'team', 'lacks', 'skill', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'effectively', 'develop', 'ideas', 'tack', 'artsy', 'ending', 'making', 'way', 'sequel', 'contrast', 'Cube', 'conclusion', 'striking', 'not', 'merely', 'gimmick.The', 'problems', 'noted', 'indicate', 'many', 'weaknesses', 'other', 'two', 'Cube', 'movies', 'first', 'Cube', 'great', 'stand-alone', 'film', 'sequels', 'provide', 'too', 'many', 'answers', 'too', 'much', 'unnecessary', 'gore', 'especially', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'Thus', 'retroactively', 'ruin', 'first', 'movie', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'inherently', 'dislike', 'sequels', 'only', 'when', 'cast', 'shadow', 'predecessors', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'inherently', 'dislike', 'gore', 'one', 'judges', 'first', 'movie', 'series', 'gore', 'really', ""n't"", 'represent', 'what', 'Cube', 'about', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'third', 'series', 'also', 'silly', 'self-parody', 'component', 'tone', 'series', 'whole.Bottom', 'line', 'Watch', 'first', 'Cube', 'avoid', 'rest']",Cube

Day ""ENIGMA""","[2, 2]","(JUST FOR THE SAKE OF THOSE WHO DONT KNOW WHAT THAT WORD MEANS) Existentialism-n-A philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness and isolation of the individual experience in a hostile or indifferent universe, regards human existence as unexplainable, and stresses freedom of choice and responsibility for the consequences of one's acts.Although ive lost some already in this review for those of you who have continued to read on to this point let us begin with the review: If any have ever read works by Camus or Sarte you have a pretty good idea about the utter desolation and pointless isolation found in the philosophical framework of existentialism. However if you've read Sarte's play called No EXIST (a great piece of work by the way) You will find three people trapped in HELL looking for an exist only to find that in the end there is no escaping oneself and that hell in fact is other people and the torture we inflict on each other. In the CUBE you will find a highly advanced visual concept of this wonderful masterpiece. I wont go into much detail so as not to ruin it for those of you who haven't seen it. But I will give you a taste in one simple question. What would you do if you were trapped in a cube with five other people all confused and scared knowing that should you leave this cube there is a very good likelihood you will be killed (same is true if you don't leave the cube), oh and by the way one of the guys in the room with you is slowly turning into a paranoid schizophrenic with homicidal tendencies? Another point I should make is that if you go into this movie with pre judgments regarding the movie and how it should run you will likely be disappointed. This movie is very unique in its own right, Most movies have outside sub stories and subplots, however as any student of Existentialism knows there is no outside, no heaven, no hell, only the here and now, there is no god (if there were one why would he let you be put into such a terrible predicament?), there is no one outside the cube, and no one cares about those inside it, the only thing that might hold some meaning is, the actions we make in this life and the consequences that come as a result. All the effort we make in life for the most part is pointless and has little if any real meaning. You will see this in true form when they meet the REN for the second time in this movie (im sorry that was a little bit of a spoiler) The only reason I wont give the movie five stars was due to the fact that the ending was pretty predictable, and I think anyone will see it coming early on. However, if you are the type that enjoys a good thinking movie that makes you ask the age old question of WHAT WOULD I DO IN THAT SITUATION? or are just a major philosophy buff check this movie out, I think you'll be glad you did.",4,EXISTENTIALISM AT ITS BEST!!!!,1111881600,"03 27, 2005",2005,2807,"['JUST', 'THE', 'SAKE', 'OF', 'THOSE', 'WHO', 'DONT', 'KNOW', 'WHAT', 'THAT', 'WORD', 'MEANS', 'Existentialism-n-A', 'philosophy', 'uniqueness', 'isolation', 'individual', 'experience', 'hostile', 'indifferent', 'universe', 'regards', 'human', 'existence', 'unexplainable', 'freedom', 'choice', 'responsibility', 'consequences', 'one', 'acts.Although', 'ive', 'lost', 'already', 'review', 'who', 'have', 'continued', 'read', 'point', 'let', 'begin', 'review', 'have', 'ever', 'read', 'works', 'Camus', 'Sarte', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'utter', 'desolation', 'pointless', 'isolation', 'found', 'philosophical', 'framework', 'existentialism', 'However', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Sarte', 'play', 'called', 'EXIST', 'great', 'piece', 'work', 'way', 'will', 'find', 'three', 'people', 'trapped', 'HELL', 'looking', 'exist', 'only', 'find', 'end', 'escaping', 'hell', 'fact', 'other', 'people', 'torture', 'inflict', 'other', 'CUBE', 'will', 'find', 'highly', 'advanced', 'visual', 'concept', 'wonderful', 'masterpiece', 'wont', 'go', 'much', 'detail', 'so', 'not', 'ruin', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'will', 'give', 'taste', 'one', 'simple', 'question', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'were', 'trapped', 'cube', 'five', 'other', 'people', 'confused', 'scared', 'knowing', 'should', 'leave', 'cube', 'very', 'good', 'likelihood', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'same', 'true', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'cube', 'oh', 'way', 'one', 'guys', 'room', 'slowly', 'turning', 'paranoid', 'schizophrenic', 'homicidal', 'tendencies', 'point', 'should', 'make', 'go', 'movie', 'pre', 'judgments', 'regarding', 'movie', 'how', 'should', 'run', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'very', 'unique', 'own', 'right', 'Most', 'movies', 'have', 'outside', 'sub', 'stories', 'subplots', 'however', 'student', 'Existentialism', 'knows', 'outside', 'heaven', 'hell', 'only', 'here', 'now', 'god', 'were', 'one', 'why', 'would', 'let', 'be', 'put', 'terrible', 'predicament', 'one', 'cube', 'one', 'only', 'thing', 'might', 'hold', 'meaning', 'actions', 'make', 'life', 'consequences', 'come', 'result', 'effort', 'make', 'life', 'most', 'part', 'pointless', 'little', 'real', 'meaning', 'will', 'see', 'true', 'form', 'when', 'meet', 'REN', 'second', 'time', 'movie', 'im', 'sorry', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'spoiler', 'only', 'reason', 'wont', 'give', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'was', 'due', 'fact', 'ending', 'was', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'think', 'anyone', 'will', 'see', 'coming', 'early', 'However', 'are', 'type', 'good', 'thinking', 'movie', 'ask', 'age', 'old', 'question', 'WHAT', 'WOULD', 'DO', 'IN', 'SITUATION', 'are', 'just', 'major', 'philosophy', 'buff', 'check', 'movie', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'did']",Cube

Okay these people get  trapped in this big cube with like 17000+ rooms, (damn).  Eventually they  all meet up, exept for one in the beggining which is posibly the best  moment in the entire film, it certainly got my hopes up!  ight there was a  little description but now for the bad parts.  Okay looking from a  pesimists view thats probably didnt happen, the entire film couldve been  shot in like two rooms and a blue sceen!  Im not going against low budget  movies but the thing is a hypd up Movie like CUBE could've done so much  more for the imagination, it left no thoughts in your mind, just those of  quadrilatic equasions (people who've seen the film before will know what im  talking about), and mathmatical insights.  This film challenges your mind  against the Mathmatician of the group of Marooned citizens, there only hope  is her genuius and somone elses that they find along the way! (again people  who've seen the film know what im on  about).  If you dont like films that  make you thinki would encourage you to NOT to watch this film, as from some  peoples views it could be seen as a boring film, then again from other  peoples views it could be the best Twilight Zone type film ever made.

Despite some drawbacks, this  movie was VERY impressive. Just imagine that for almost two hours, the rather creepy  setting  whereas the action unfolds, does not change once. What you see in  the opening scene is  what you see till the movie ends. Yet you're  superglued to the screen this entire time.  Soon you get sort of paranoid  as you're forced to stare at the interlocking, totally  identical rooms  (with difference only in their color schemes) that assemble a giant maze in the form of a cube.This movie, in brief, is an allegory of life in all its aspects. You're stuck in a cube, you don't know who put you there and why, what your purpose is, or what you're supposed to do next. Is it God who did this to you, or is it all just a coincidence, or huge joke? Every step may be your last. You have to figure things out even though they seem pointless and unsolvable. Your choices decide your fate. Your questions are never answered to  the fullest. And all the while, social, racial, gender and other differences clash mercilessly. Sounds like life, doesn't it?It is a film about the human nature more than  anything else. Yes, the  characters are stereotypical in some ways, and  there are clich&eacute;s. But I think few people realize that those stereotypes  and clich&eacute;s are broken completely as we go along. Or so I sensed. The  dialogue (described as ""lame"" by many) didn't bother me at all.

There's enough drama that happens throughout the movie that it is very interesting.  It's not just people simply going through different passageways.

Six people trapped in a gigantic cube composed of rooms, some innocious, some others rigged with silent and deadly traps. Why have they been put here ? What is the Cube for ? What must they do to escape ? They don't know. But what they do believe is that by cooperating, armed with only their boots and their wits, they can get out. Little do they know...I am a science-fiction fan, and this may cloud my judgment. Cube has been criticized for its average acting and a clich&eacute; script. I don't know : I don't ask too much from actors, and I didn't find the acting to be noticeably negative. I didn't dislike the script either, although there is one character that should have come out far more likeable than he/she does in the movie. Let's just say the death in the middle of the movie really cheered me up. Those who saw the movie will know what I mean. Also, warning for the faint-hearted, Cube is also somewhat of a horror movie. If seeing a head eaten thru by acid is likely to give you nightmares, steer clear of Cube. Although I hate gore, there was not enough of it here to put me off the movie.Discussing the nature of Cube would give away too much spoilers, so I can't really get into the philosophical substance. Suffice it to say that it is brillant (it is a wonderful indictment of statism and bureaucracy in general), although it doesn't really relate to much else in the movie. But the rest of the movie is very interesting too.It is interesting to note that, for such an intelligent movie, the director and actors are totally clueless chaps, especially if you watch the little interview in the DVD with Nicole DeBoer, who incidentally was Ezri Dax in Deep Space Nine (I also thought that the policeman sounded like Sisko, but it's probably just my imagination). Perhaps this is a case where luck contributed to art.

455530,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,6305238065,General Zombie,"[2, 2]","I won't say too much cause there's really not much to say about the plot beyond the premise:  A pack of unrelated individuals find themselves inside a complex of interconnected cube-shaped rooms which seem to go on forever.  (And some of them contain traps...)  Needless to say, they must get out, though they have few clues.  If this premise sounds interesting to you, check it out, though you should note that this was made for only like $500,000 so the acting and production values aren't going to be up to major-release standards.  I say this partially because 'Cube' is unusually prominent for a film this cheap, so it draws the attention of the sort of viewer that wouldn't necessarily be used to watching something this low-budget, and thus is unable to make the leaps necessary to get into this.  It is abundantly obvious that many of the negative reviews here come from people in this position.  They certainly aren't required to like 'Cube', but their opinions really aren't of much use to  those who'd be part of the core audience of the film.Suffice to say, if you've watched many low-budget genre films you'll have seen plenty of cheaper effects and worse acting, so these sort of complaints won't effect you much. (And frankly the acting just generally isn't bad for the most part.  The Quentin character tends to over do it a lot of the time, but everyone else is fine.  They ain't gonna win any Oscars, but they're serviceable.)  It does slow down perhaps a bit too much at times, but it's got enough clever, significant revelations at various points to maintain interest, and the dialogue and conflicts between the characters prove fairly entertaining during the downtime.  The film has got some rather nice gore, I might mention, not a whole lot of it, but they make it count.  Furthermore, it does seem to have some allegorical concerns relating to modern society and whatnot, and while it doesn't say anything terribly profound, I think it comes up with some reasonably salient and truthful comments on how the modern world works, and illustrates this stuff well through the actual plot of the film rather than just tacking it on.  More significant, it's got enough going for it from a purely dramatic standpoint that it can work even if you don't care about these thematic concerns.

There aren't any real names in this film, though you may recognize a few of the faces.The premise is not unlike an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" or ""The Outer Limits,"" but its full length provides for some in depth looks at the people involved.  A group of people, with no relation to each other, are whisked away in the middle of the night and left in a largish bizarre looking room - a cube.  They don't know why they are there or how they got there.  They just know they want out.  They soon discover that there is no simple way out.  They are in a single cube that is one of many other cubes all part of a single large cube.  In order to escape they must move from cube to cube.  The only problem is that some of the cubes are boobytrapped - in a deadly way.  They must work together as a team and trust each other in order to escape.Personal stregnths and problems become helps and hinderances as they proceed with their mission.

455537,A457S8SW690NM,6305238065,hi,"[2, 3]","Cube is a movie containing actors that I never heard of and a very original plot. This movie was a tough one to make probably because a good amount of people would disslike it. Why? Because it takes your brain to have an on switch to comprehend what's going on. The ending at first hade me thinking: what the heck? Until I thought about it, and it made sense. This seemingly weird ending ended out being one of the most original and smart endings that I've ever seen.The acting for the movie is fair with 1 or 2 good performances and the rest pretty average.The movie has strangers waking up in a mysterious location..a cube. They learn to know each other and try to find out why they are there. There are doors everywhere and as they travel it, they decide that they all have an important function to escaping. Standing in their path are booby traps that are all activated by different senses. Some of the deaths are incredibly gruesome (check out the opening scene) but pretty fascinating.The movie's weird, I'll tell you that, and might be a puzzle for some people. Some might be dissapointed by the ending that doesn't really solve some mind blocks. But, that didn't matter to me anymore..on the other hand, what mattered was human nature and showing all of these strangers' nature. The movie is like a study..throw some strangers in a mysterious location and see what they'll do. The result isn't pretty. It shows how desperate humans are and how far some will go to achieve what they want. And that's really what made me enjoy this movie..this study.In the end, I was trully fascinated as the real human nature, the most unlikely person comes out. This shows a fascinating idea that made me in awe. It's not about what people are on the outside but what they are on the inside. And these ""heroes"" turn out to be cowards...awful cowards.Cube can't be classed in a specific section because it incorporates science fiction and a study of human nature. It definitely isn't action and calling it horror or action is plain stupid.

Apparently the original Trimark edition is being phased out.This new LG edition is still excellent, but collectors will definitely want both editions as the commentary on Trimark's is much better since it includes cast member David Hewlett (they go more in-depth to some of the aspects of the film).  Why LG decided to replace that commentary with a new one with only director Vincenzo Natali is a mystery.  The only other difference is the new LG edition has a brief interview with Nicole deBoer, and a more interactive menu.Now, on to the film itself:  Cube is one of the most original sci-fi films of the last decade.  If you were to think about what situation would terrify you the most, Cube would be the ultimate challenge.  In a way, it is a predecessor to TV's ""Survivor"" in which the people each have a skill that can help them survive and possibly get them out...here, being that seven people wake up and find themselves in an endless maze of cubed rooms, some of which are booby trapped.It all comes down to human emotions and confrontations that get in the way of the characters' progress and survival.  It's a talky film, but that's the point -- figuring situations and dealing with different personalities is inevitable to any group.  The solving of problems becomes very complex, but the viewer doesn't have to worry...let the characters figure it out as we go along for the ride!While so many sci-fi films want to wow you with effects, Cube does something more daring -- it makes you think!  With its limited budget working FOR its advantage and some digital effects that preceded even the film Titanic, Cube still proves itself as one of the most original and intelligent thrillers of the last decade.  It is truly a nail-biter.Those who need more visual thrills and less ""thinking"" should just then stick with Cube 2: Hypercube.  However, this first and superior Cube is a masterpiece!

455543,A372X206KVOQWQ,6305238065,"Isehara ""isehara2""","[2, 4]","This is an interesting movie in many ways. The basic theme is fantastic. A number of individuals are somehow abducted and placed in a giant Rubiks cube in essence. Supposedly there are thousands of rooms in the structure, each room with six exits and may containing lethal traps. The idea is to figure out which rooms have traps and which rooms lead to the exit. Another twist is that the rooms also move on a regular basis. I am not sure if the movie concept is original to this film or has been taken from somewhere else but it was enough to make me want to see it without any reviews from elsewhere. Where the movie fails terribly is in the story. Instead on being able to follow this group as they heroically try to escape this fiendish trap the film shows the characters fighting and killing each other. I understand that being trapped in this situation would be stressful for anybody but I think that most people would want to escape rather than assaulting and murdering their fellow prisoners. The movie focuses on this conflict rather than their environment or the attempt to escape. One of the character essentially goes &quot;postal&quot;; this almost makes the movie just another typical violent gorefest. The brilliant premise of the movie and the environment are not exploited to anywhere near their potential. I would much rather have had a plot line where there was of course stress amongst the characters but they were still able to work together.

He invents a model of our psyche in which we are, everyone of us, locked up in a cube that is the universe of our consciousness. We are thus psychotic since the outside world does not exist. And yet the master of this world has set six windows, one on each side, all around us. We can open them, one at a time, and get out into another cube that has to be the psyche of someone else. But this trip is very dangerous. There might be a trap in that other cube, a trap set by the other or by the supermaster of the universe. We may be killed and die instantly. Hence we enjoy and find a sweet and soft refuge in our own psychosis. But sooner or later someone will come into our cube or we will get into another cube where we will find someone else. The drama of meeting with others will start as a competition to find a way out if there is one. But we will discover very fast that all the cubes of all the individuals of the world are all connected within an even bigger cube but that the various cubes are constantly moving. And yet there is a way out and we must find it. We are little by little becoming schizophrenic. And the elimination of the others becomes the objective that erases the possible escape from this world that we may have caressed for a while. Terminate the others, and fast please. To escape this world we need two qualities. First to be able to mentally and spiritually feel, sense and grasp the wider scope and scheme that is behind this cube, these cubes, and we then can see the red thread that is going to lead us to the exit. And we need to be attached to absolutely no one, or even to get rid of all those who could become attached to you or to whom you may get attached. These two qualities are autistic characteristics, but it is generally considered in our society as a disease if not some retardation. Thence we shrink in front of the others and we go back to our cocoonic psychosis that is more comfortable than this schizophrenia. Who controls this world ? Is it God ? But then what about divine love ? Is it the most pathetic human invention ever put forward, not to speak of a pure folly that we have spread among human animals like a retrovirus that turned these animals into self-declared human beings ?

Actually they are prisoners and no one remembers how they got there.  There are small square doors on every side of the high top and deep bottom rooms, top to bottom, side to side.  Some rooms have walls that are lit red, white, blue, orange or green.  Some rooms have a high-tech booby trap ready to kill anyone who enters the room.  Eventually, as people go through this repeated maze of rooms trying to find that one cuberoom that leads to the bridge of freedom, people meet each other, but some will go crazy and some will die.

So when I went to the Staff Recomendations shelf, I grabbed this one off the shelf. As I went to the registration, the guy said 'it's an awesome movie'. So as I popped open the DVD player, I watched the trailer before seeing the movie. 4 nights later, I decided to watch this on the PC with head-phones. I was glad I watchd this. Cube is one of the best movies ever made with a great story, awesome suspence, nice acting, good characters and some great gory scenes. But mostly, this is more story and suspence than gore. Now a lot of movies ripped off the begining scene and the sets, including the story. We have The Cell, Resident Evil, AVP and House of 9.The start of Saw referenced the scene where the characters woke up in the Cube, with no idea how the hell they got there.Now a lot of people say the acting was above average. I though the acting was ok. Andrew Miller (Kazan) did a great job, David Hewllit (Worth) was awesome and the others were fine too.The suspence was great. It was so dark and freaky. You hear the other rooms going to the other side when you're all alone and thats what makes it scary.The story has this 'scratch your head' moments and you want to know whats going on. The building of the Cube is the real mystery; who's using it and why use it.Vincenzo Natali did a fantastic job here. I love his sets and atmosphere for this movie because it keeps you guessing, it keeps you on the edge of you seat and most of all, it proves that he is a very good filmmaker. I also think he made a great choice of hiring composer Mark Korven. He is an excellent composer. He's soundtrack of the movie makes me wanna get the soundtrack myself. So did I have a good time watching this? YES, because it was different from the other 1997 movies.Overall, this movie is awesome. If you haven't seen this movie, nows your chance. Get to your nearest video store and grab this off the shelf.Acting: 8/10David Hewllit (Worth) had an awesome character here. He shows us how good and proving he really is. Nicole de Boer (Leaven) did have some good parts. She does this teenage thing really well. Andrew Miller (Kazan) made me love his character. It feels so real.Gore: 9/10The start scene was one of the most original thing I've seen in the 90's. A guy gets cut into cubes, acid burns some guy's face off, an impalment, some blood and a severed leg (if you have wide-screen, you know what I'm talking about)T&A;: 0/10None, but who needs it anyway?Directing: 10/10Vincenzo Natali has created one of the most atospheric moods of the 90's. Another winner.Bottom Line: Sci Fi and Horror fans should check out this excellent and awesome film. It is so good I kept watching it a dozen times. If only it was aviallable to buy in stores.Followed by 2 sequels, the extremely dissapointing Cube 2: Hypercube and the awesome Cube Zero.",5,One of the best thrillers ever made,1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,2910,"['Ok', 'last', 'year', 'went', 'video', 'store', 'rent', 'movie', 'kill', 'time', 'So', 'when', 'went', 'Staff', 'Recomendations', 'shelf', 'grabbed', 'one', 'shelf', 'went', 'registration', 'guy', 'said', ""'it"", 'awesome', 'movie', 'popped', 'open', 'DVD', 'player', 'watched', 'trailer', 'seeing', 'movie', '4', 'nights', 'later', 'decided', 'watch', 'PC', 'head-phones', 'was', 'glad', 'watchd', 'Cube', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'great', 'story', 'awesome', 'suspence', 'nice', 'acting', 'good', 'characters', 'great', 'gory', 'scenes', 'mostly', 'more', 'story', 'suspence', 'gore', 'Now', 'lot', 'movies', 'ripped', 'off', 'begining', 'scene', 'sets', 'including', 'story', 'have', 'Cell', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'AVP', 'House', '9.The', 'start', 'Saw', 'referenced', 'scene', 'where', 'characters', 'woke', 'up', 'Cube', 'idea', 'how', 'hell', 'got', 'there.Now', 'lot', 'people', 'say', 'acting', 'was', 'above', 'average', 'acting', 'was', 'ok.', 'Andrew', 'Miller', 'Kazan', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'David', 'Hewllit', 'Worth', 'was', 'awesome', 'others', 'were', 'fine', 'too.The', 'suspence', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'so', 'dark', 'freaky', 'hear', 'other', 'rooms', 'going', 'other', 'side', 'when', ""'re"", 'alone', 'thats', 'what', 'scary.The', 'story', ""'scratch"", 'head', 'moments', 'want', 'know', 'whats', 'going', 'building', 'Cube', 'real', 'mystery', 'who', 'using', 'why', 'use', 'it.Vincenzo', 'Natali', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'here', 'love', 'sets', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'guessing', 'edge', 'seat', 'most', 'very', 'good', 'filmmaker', 'also', 'think', 'made', 'great', 'choice', 'hiring', 'composer', 'Mark', 'Korven', 'excellent', 'composer', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'wan', 'get', 'soundtrack', 'So', 'did', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'watching', 'YES', 'was', 'different', 'other', '1997', 'movies.Overall', 'movie', 'awesome', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'chance', 'Get', 'nearest', 'video', 'store', 'grab', 'off', 'shelf.Acting', '8/10David', 'Hewllit', 'Worth', 'had', 'awesome', 'character', 'here', 'how', 'good', 'proving', 'really', 'Nicole', 'Boer', 'Leaven', 'did', 'have', 'good', 'parts', 'teenage', 'thing', 'really', 'well', 'Andrew', 'Miller', 'Kazan', 'made', 'love', 'character', 'so', 'real.Gore', '9/10The', 'start', 'scene', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'seen', '90', 'guy', 'cut', 'cubes', 'acid', 'burns', 'guy', 'face', 'off', 'impalment', 'blood', 'severed', 'leg', 'have', 'wide-screen', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'T', 'A', '0/10None', 'who', 'anyway', 'Directing', '10/10Vincenzo', 'Natali', 'created', 'one', 'most', 'atospheric', 'moods', '90', 'winner.Bottom', 'Line', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'Horror', 'fans', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'excellent', 'awesome', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'kept', 'watching', 'dozen', 'times', 'only', 'was', 'aviallable', 'buy', 'stores.Followed', '2', 'sequels', 'extremely', 'dissapointing', 'Cube', '2', 'Hypercube', 'awesome', 'Cube', 'Zero']",Cube

The movie can be described either as a cyberpunk version of Sartre's *Huis Clos*, with the same cast of generally unlikable, irritating and semi-hysterical characters, or as a post-modern episode of the *Twilight Zone* set inside a Rubik's Cube. I listened to most of the (very enthusiastic) audio commentary, and although I was particularly impressed by the filmmakers' resourcefulness, it didn't teach me much about the point of the movie, which I believe to be nonexistent: *Cube* should probably be seen as a stylistic composition by film students who have absorbed tons of movies by Sam Raimi, Roman Polanski, Hitchcock, Ozu and Dario Argento (among the various directors mentioned in the commentary). It is a self-absorbed movie, which does not have much to say about the world-out-there (apart from its surprisingly benevolent view of technology) but rather seems trapped within its own references and internal correspondences.

455550,A1RSXP7MB772E3,6305238065,"Jeff W. Shimkus ""Movie Manji""","[0, 0]","Cube is a Kafkaesque movie. If you've done any research about this fabulous movie you're sure to find that description colored throughout those reviews. The seven people here are senselessly made to find their way free of a threatening cube of complex mathematical problems that may lead to freedom. Freedom always seems attainable yet the trials distort reality. Frustrating questions like, ""Why are we here"", and ""who put us here"", are set aside because of the life or death challenges in front of them. That elusive freedom drives these people to their best and worst qualities. Much like many of Kafka's parables: this is a moral story. And this is certainly a movie that begs for repeated views. It is such an interesting movie, presented with mysticism and an aura of surrealness that it becomes a standout movie amidst a lifetime of repetitive movies.There are those of us that have found fault in this movie, such as in the math. I will not go into all of that. I'll leave that to the ""glass is half-empty people."" I choose to say that this movie is an attempt at intelligence, something that far too few companies even attempt to do. I adore the movie who's characters need to solve complex math to move the story along. A story about human qualities, and the essence of our ways.The music is minimalistic, and I can't say that it added to the dramatics of Cube. But I did not judge this to be a flaw. If anything, the scarcity of music made me feel even more isolated and alone with these poor people. I would say that it even works. You start off, not with some magnificent musical birth, like many movies, instead you can almost feel the cold steel on your skin. That uneasy feeling you get in a hospital, waiting for the doctor to check your body, to probe your body. There is always a feeling that you are not in control.I really enjoyed the look of Cube also. Even though every room is just a cube, they still manage to evoke visual interest by switching it up, changing the lights (sometimes eerie photo-room lights), and maybe a design change every now and then. I have noticed that the rooms do have a steely, computer-chip look to them. It gave me the sense of a cold hearted designer with no use for asthetics.I will comment a little about the ending, but will not spoil anything for you. It is a climax that will leave some without enough answers, yet the feeling alone, will surely fill the appetite of the hungry film lover. I am not one to appreciate a vagueness, or openness in an ending, I feel the climax must have some reason to it. Yet this film is true to its Kafkaesque nature, in that you say to yourself, ""what was it for?""Cube gives us shocking violence and at times unbearable suspense. It is a film of complexities, unique eeriness, and swamping trials of endurance.

The rest of the movie focused more on the paranoia, fear, and desperation of the remaining characters.  And shows what each character has to offer to help the others escape.Not a bad movie at all, I'd give it 3 or 4 stars.  The reason I gave this DVD 5 stars?

455555,A3GTH1VXNRYZS5,6305238065,"""j_james""","[3, 4]","There was a reviewer who said many of these synopses miss the point and for the most part I agree with him. He argued that the characters were allegories for six common types of people: the militiristic, conceited leader, the book smart nerd who lacks common sense, the nihilist, the paranoid care giver, the innocent, somewhat ignorant, child, and the hardened criminal who cares only about himself. Like I said, he's right, but I think he oversimplifies the issue. The cube itself is an allegory. An allegory of the world we live in (yes, I realize that it was meant to look like someone's concept of hell, but who can prove that the Earth we reside on isn't someone's concept of hell?). This brings me to my most important metaphysical point. A lot of people--both reviewers in this forum as well as friends I've discussed this film with--get hung up on the fact that we never learn who constructed this cube and let this hang up negatively affect their opinion of this flick. I say that's silly because it shouldn't matter who constructed it. Nevermind the fact that the dialogue dismisses the concern by saying, let's remember that the cube is an allegory of the earth. And the characters in the film ask the same questions that philosophers have been asking for centuries: who created this? what is the point? how do we succeed and ascend? what ethical code do we need to obey? But just as all of these philosophers can't answer these questions, either can the characters. And if they could answer the questions, the allegory would be ruined, and the movie would fail.But that's enough philosophical babble. Let's consider the film itself. Many say these characters aren't developed. I don't agree. Each character has their own personality and each character is affected differently by the cube. One goes completely insane, one gets angry and determined, another is resolved to solve the riddle, and another is convinced it can't be solved. Are these characters 3 dimensional; maybe not. But that doesn't matter. We see as much of these people as they could ever be expected to reveal of themselves in front of perfect strangers in a situation such as this. Another common complaint is the dialogue, the writing. Dialogue is a tricky thing, but it was written very well here and I don't understand the complaint.Where the movie fails for me is the ending. I don't see it's point. All of the metaphyisical and allegorical objectives of the flick were already achieved. It had already shown us that we need to work together, rather than against each other, if there's any hope to saving the human race. It had shown us that we need to look for and find the intrinsic value of person we meet, rather than assuming some are worse than others. All the ending does is succumb to traditional horror methods, and weakens the overall effect of the movie.Technically speaking, the camara angles do a remarkable job of further developing the cube's claustophobic effects. The sound design and music are chilling and flawless. The lighting is kind of hokie and some the shot frames a little cliched--though others are inventive.If not for the end, I'd say this is a four (simply because I almost never give fives) considering the budget they had to work with.",3,"An Allegory? yes.

A handful of people awaken to find themselves trapped inside a bunch of cubical rooms, connected by doors in each of the six faces. They have no idea where they are or how to get out, but since they have no food or water, they need to find out fairly quickly. But some of the rooms contain deadly booby-traps, and nobody knows how to tell which ones they are. Turns out all the rooms form one giant cube; nobody knows exactly why anyone wanted to construct such a complicated, useless, and potentially deadly piece of machinery -- let alone why anybody would deliberately put _people_ in it . . .This premise would have been at home on the old 'Twilight Zone' series (or even on the original 'Star Trek', with the trapped parties being Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, and 'Crewman Green'). And ya don't gotta be Kafka to smell the allegory; at any rate, if _your_ life has never felt like this, you probably won't like the movie.The execution is very good too. Obviously a film like this requires a small ensemble cast and a script that manages to keep things interesting for an hour and a half even though all the 'action' takes place inside a series of practically identical cubical rooms. It has both. I won't spoil anything here, but there are some genuinely suspenseful moments and there's a lot of excruciating _psychological_ tension. (And not just from claustrophobia.)I'm knocking off a star just because I just don't think the characters quite gel. They're interesting enough, but they're neither sufficiently complex to keep me fully engaged with them nor sufficiently 'archetypal' to support the allegory. In some respects their characterization occasionally seems inconsistent.Very cool movie, though, and the slightly weak characterization isn't much of a drawback. It's not at all a 'hopeful' film and the ending won't make you gasp with moral relief; nor will all that many of your questions get answered.

We never know for sure what the 'Cube' really is, but it's open to many an interesting interpretation. The first dude who gets sliced with the wire fence was a great scene. There was not enough of that. There should have been like 20 people in the 'Cube' for some really grousome scenes. Remember the one that the cop almost fell into and escaped with only a leg wound? I'd love to see what a body would look like after being caught in that.The brainy little girl with the glasses was ultra hot. She made nerds everywhere stand up and take notice. I'll never think of prime numbers the same way again.The cop was a real ass. He starts off like he's going to be the hero and the leader, but ends up being feared and ultimatly killed.

Bernabo,"[2, 4]","At its best I think ""Cube"" is an example of post-modern existentialism, although I am certainly loath to explain that particular combination of 20th century reactions to modernism. At its worst it seems like a pointless variation on an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" which may or may not be ""Five Characters in Search of an Exit"" (but if you watched Rod Serling's series I am sure that at least one episode will spring to mind as you watch ""Cube""). However, just because I think that Vincenzo Natali's film is trying to be provocative does not mean that I think it is necessarily being profound.""Cube"" begins with our first look at the cube set that will be creatively redressed throughout the film. A man (Julian Richings) enters the cube and we discover that these can be places of great danger. We do not know what is going on, but whatever game is being played it is decidedly deadly. We then meet the players and the game begins in earnest. Eventually we find there are six people still alive in this system of interlocking cubes. Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint) is a cop, Rennes (Wayne Robson) a prison escape artist, David (David Hewlett) is an architect, Helen (Nicky Guadagni) a doctor, Leaven (Nicole de Boer) a math student, and Kazan (Andrew Miller) is autistic. None of them know how they got there, why they are there dressed in uniforms, or what they are supposed to do next. All they know is that in every cube there are six hatches leading to the next cube, one on each side. What they learn is what we already know. Some cubes are not safe.The six assume they are in a maze. Since there was a way in there must be a way out, and one of them figures out that there are actually clues as to which hatches it is safe to go through and which are not. That becomes our biggest clue as to what we are supposed to be doing as viewers, because it is clear in this 1997 film that putting ourselves in the position of the characters is problematic. For me watching ""Cube"" was similar to watching ""Survivor"": the main thought going through my mind is that I would be dead because I would not be physically up to the challenge. So I did not get into the ""what would I do in that situation"" frame of mind.Instead my focus became on the group of six people. When we learn that one of them has a reputation for breaking out of prisons we discover that these people are not only the only resources the group has but also the only ones they need. The point is that the lesson is lost on the group, and the question is whether they will figure it out in time. Of course, the larger question is ""what is going on?"" However, at this point in the saga (""Cube 2: Hypercube"" came out in 2002 and ""Cube Zero"" just come out on DVD), that would be telling. More importantly, the fact that they do not tell is key to appreciating what is going on. It is not yet time for the big picture, but for the intimate horror story being laid out for us.Even if you are not interested in why this is happening, the ""what"" of ""Cube"" is compelling enough. The deadly cubes are always dangerous in different ways, and you are always wondering what is going to happen next. Especially since the ""deeper"" the group goes into the ""maze,"" the more they get into their own paranoia, which is decidedly not good for the developing group dynamic. In the end, ""Cube"" can be dismissed as a shaggy dog story, but it is a much more engrossing one than the story about the pink and purple polka dotted ping pong ball.",4,The post-modern existentialist most dangerous game?,1109203200,"02 24, 2005",2005,3479,"['best', 'think', 'Cube', 'example', 'post-modern', 'existentialism', 'am', 'certainly', 'loath', 'explain', 'particular', 'combination', '20th', 'century', 'reactions', 'modernism', 'worst', 'pointless', 'variation', 'episode', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Five', 'Characters', 'Search', 'Exit', 'watched', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'series', 'am', 'sure', 'least', 'one', 'episode', 'will', 'spring', 'mind', 'watch', 'Cube', 'However', 'just', 'think', 'Vincenzo', 'Natali', 'film', 'trying', 'be', 'provocative', 'not', 'mean', 'think', 'necessarily', 'being', 'profound', 'Cube', 'first', 'look', 'cube', 'set', 'will', 'be', 'creatively', 'redressed', 'film', 'man', 'Julian', 'Richings', 'cube', 'discover', 'can', 'be', 'places', 'great', 'danger', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'game', 'being', 'played', 'decidedly', 'deadly', 'then', 'meet', 'players', 'game', 'earnest', 'Eventually', 'find', 'are', 'six', 'people', 'still', 'alive', 'system', 'interlocking', 'cubes', 'Quentin', 'Maurice', 'Dean', 'Wint', 'cop', 'Rennes', 'Wayne', 'Robson', 'prison', 'escape', 'artist', 'David', 'David', 'Hewlett', 'architect', 'Helen', 'Nicky', 'Guadagni', 'doctor', 'Leaven', 'Nicole', 'de', 'Boer', 'math', 'student', 'Kazan', 'Andrew', 'Miller', 'autistic', 'None', 'know', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'why', 'are', 'there', 'dressed', 'uniforms', 'what', 'are', 'supposed', 'do', 'next', 'know', 'cube', 'are', 'six', 'hatches', 'leading', 'next', 'cube', 'one', 'side', 'What', 'learn', 'what', 'already', 'know', 'cubes', 'are', 'not', 'safe.The', 'six', 'are', 'maze', 'was', 'way', 'must', 'be', 'way', 'one', 'out', 'are', 'actually', 'clues', 'hatches', 'safe', 'go', 'are', 'not', 'biggest', 'clue', 'what', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'doing', 'viewers', 'clear', '1997', 'film', 'putting', 'position', 'characters', 'problematic', 'watching', 'Cube', 'was', 'similar', 'watching', 'Survivor', 'main', 'thought', 'going', 'mind', 'would', 'be', 'dead', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'physically', 'challenge', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'situation', 'frame', 'mind.Instead', 'focus', 'became', 'group', 'six', 'people', 'When', 'learn', 'one', 'reputation', 'breaking', 'prisons', 'discover', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'only', 'resources', 'group', 'also', 'only', 'ones', 'need', 'point', 'lesson', 'lost', 'group', 'question', 'will', 'figure', 'out', 'time', 'course', 'larger', 'question', 'what', 'going', 'However', 'point', 'saga', 'Cube', '2', 'Hypercube', 'came', 'out', '2002', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'just', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'telling', 'More', 'importantly', 'fact', 'do', 'not', 'tell', 'key', 'appreciating', 'what', 'going', 'not', 'yet', 'time', 'big', 'picture', 'intimate', 'horror', 'story', 'being', 'laid', 'out', 'us.Even', 'are', 'not', 'interested', 'why', 'happening', 'what', 'Cube', 'compelling', 'enough', 'deadly', 'cubes', 'are', 'always', 'dangerous', 'different', 'ways', 'are', 'always', 'wondering', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'Especially', 'deeper', 'group', 'maze', 'more', 'get', 'own', 'paranoia', 'decidedly', 'not', 'good', 'developing', 'group', 'dynamic', 'end', 'Cube', 'can', 'be', 'dismissed', 'shaggy', 'dog', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'engrossing', 'one', 'story', 'pink', 'purple', 'polka', 'dotted', 'ping', 'pong', 'ball']",Cube

Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[6, 8]","""Cube"" is constructed in the style of the so-called ""New Wave"" of science fiction, which has actually existed for more than 20 years and is no longer so ""new.""  The characteristics of New Wave are that the endings are often more ambiguous, and the science part of science fiction is often significantly less well explained or perhaps even understood, causing some New Wave science fiction to border on fantasy.  In the case of this movie, a group of people are spirited away from various places with no memory of being moved, only to wake up in a room in the shape of a cube.At first it appears that the people were randomly chosen.  However, as the movie progresses there appeared to have been logic as to why this particular group of people was chosen, though the specifics of the logic are never explained.  We find out later that the group of people chosen has the capability of escaping from what turns out to be a gigantic maze of cubes.If the only task of this group of people was to escape from the cube maze this movie would have been very boring.  When one of the characters is killed in a most gruesome fashion near the beginning of the movie we learn that some of the cubes are booby-trapped.  We also learn that there are cubes that are not booby-trapped and by a mathematical calculation you may determine whether the next room is safe or contains death in the form of acids, various cutting instruments, flame, etc.  The movie slowly moves the characters from one cube to the next, fighting the cubes as well as themselves, and losing characters along the way.  I will not reveal the end of the movie for those who plan to watch it.The one thing this movie has going for it is the novelty of the cube maze.  Adding the booby traps changes this movie from a pure mystery to a cerebral exercise.  Why was the maze created?  Why were these particular people chosen?  Why booby-trap the rooms?  Are these people just human guinea pigs?  Is there a safe way out of the cubes?  Given that the majority of this action in this movie is arguing and moving from cube to cube, the speculations provided are the core of the movie.I was intrigued by ""Cube"" and have seen it twice.  However, after having seen it twice I am no longer amused and do not plan to watch it again.  While the concept of the cube maze is interesting, there is a certain measure of futility that discourages multiple viewings.  The futility of being in the maze adds to the generally poor acting and occasional over-acting.

455575,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,6305238065,"Maine Writer ""David""","[8, 9]","This movie drips of big aspirations.  People trapped in a bizarre maze of rooms.  The rooms, it turns out, are navigable, provided you're bright enough figure out their sophisticated, Rubik's Cube design.  And, it turns out, the only person who might have enough brain power to ultimately get the right answer is a Rain Man-style savant who appears to be able to figure out mathematical problems that are best left to computers.That's the window-dressing.  The characters are archetypes.  Rather crudely drawn archetypes, but serviceable nonetheless.  Among them: the alpha male, whose penchant for control is equalled by capacity for brutality; the nurturing, but sterile woman who ultimately finds her humanity; the cynical, bright man who, at least temporarily, becomes a champion; the idiot savant, all innocence and brilliance, albeit annoying.They recall, vaguely, a life before the cube.  But what, exactly, is the cube?  Is it a metaphor for modern life?  Is it the afterlife?  Is it a nightmare?  Is it, like the oddly well-done Twilight Zone episode, a trashcan filled with discarded dolls.  Well, the movie doesn't really answer that question.  In its effort to be profound, it answers nothing.  Sure, it provides some junior-psychologist insights into personality; it also toys with alienation and nihilism.  But it lacks a satisfactory and satisfying ending.  Movies don't need to be tied up in to neat little bows to be great.  Often, the contrary is true.  But the ending needs to be revelatory in some sense--to open vistas to which the story was leading, even if those vistas are mysterious, strange, unsettling, or vague.  This is where Cube falls, no pun intended, flat.  It is a minor melodrama, hinting of much, nicely stylized, a bit unexpectedly grisly, but ultimately unsatisfying.Now, maybe that was the film makers' vision of the world.  Odd, throwaway characters (nothing deep about any of them or there capacity for communication and interrelationships), jaundiced ideals, and a meaningless existence as to which the ""outside"" represents something unknown and simply ""brighter"" than the darkness of our own existence.  Maybe.  But even if that is the truth, it is a story not all that well told.Why three stars?  Because Cube, for all its faults, still makes you think a little, which is more than you can say for many, many movies.  There are many ""why's"" about the ending that are worth ruminating as a jumping off point for some interesting questions--why that specific survivor, the purpose and origin of the ""cube,"" and the significance of the final confrontation between the characters.I'm not sure I can recommend buying this movie, but at least watch it.",3,"Almost, but not quite.",1030147200,"08 24, 2002",2002,2690,"['movie', 'drips', 'big', 'aspirations', 'People', 'trapped', 'bizarre', 'maze', 'rooms', 'rooms', 'out', 'are', 'navigable', 'provided', ""'re"", 'bright', 'enough', 'figure', 'out', 'sophisticated', 'Rubik', 'Cube', 'design', 'out', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'enough', 'brain', 'power', 'ultimately', 'get', 'right', 'answer', 'Rain', 'Man-style', 'savant', 'who', 'be', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'mathematical', 'problems', 'are', 'best', 'left', 'computers.That', 'window-dressing', 'characters', 'are', 'archetypes', 'Rather', 'crudely', 'drawn', 'archetypes', 'serviceable', 'nonetheless', 'alpha', 'male', 'penchant', 'control', 'equalled', 'capacity', 'brutality', 'nurturing', 'sterile', 'woman', 'who', 'ultimately', 'humanity', 'cynical', 'bright', 'man', 'who', 'least', 'temporarily', 'champion', 'idiot', 'savant', 'innocence', 'brilliance', 'annoying.They', 'recall', 'vaguely', 'life', 'cube', 'what', 'exactly', 'cube', 'metaphor', 'modern', 'life', 'afterlife', 'nightmare', 'oddly', 'well-done', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode', 'trashcan', 'filled', 'discarded', 'dolls', 'Well', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'answer', 'question', 'effort', 'be', 'profound', 'nothing', 'Sure', 'junior-psychologist', 'insights', 'personality', 'also', 'alienation', 'nihilism', 'satisfactory', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'Movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'tied', 'up', 'neat', 'little', 'bows', 'be', 'great', 'Often', 'contrary', 'true', 'ending', 'needs', 'be', 'revelatory', 'sense', 'open', 'vistas', 'story', 'was', 'leading', 'even', 'vistas', 'are', 'mysterious', 'strange', 'unsettling', 'vague', 'where', 'Cube', 'pun', 'intended', 'flat', 'minor', 'melodrama', 'hinting', 'much', 'nicely', 'stylized', 'bit', 'unexpectedly', 'grisly', 'ultimately', 'unsatisfying.Now', 'maybe', 'was', 'film', 'makers', 'vision', 'world', 'Odd', 'throwaway', 'characters', 'nothing', 'deep', 'capacity', 'communication', 'interrelationships', 'jaundiced', 'ideals', 'meaningless', 'existence', 'outside', 'something', 'unknown', 'simply', 'brighter', 'darkness', 'own', 'existence', 'Maybe', 'even', 'truth', 'story', 'not', 'that', 'well', 'told.Why', 'three', 'stars', 'Cube', 'faults', 'still', 'think', 'little', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'many', 'many', 'movies', 'are', 'many', 'why', 'ending', 'are', 'worth', 'ruminating', 'jumping', 'off', 'point', 'interesting', 'questions', 'why', 'specific', 'survivor', 'purpose', 'origin', 'cube', 'significance', 'final', 'confrontation', 'characters.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'can', 'recommend', 'buying', 'movie', 'least', 'watch']",Cube

455577,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,6305238065,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[2, 2]","I find myself experiencing two schools of thought when it comes tothe CUBEseries.  On the one hand, they are all poorly acted, with mostly redundant plots and predictable dialogue.  On the other hand, their structures are so blatantly philosophical, so unabashadly symbolic, it's kind of a treat to sit back and fiddle with the concepts it represents.  Sorta the same way you'd fill in a few of the boxes on a crossword puzzle you know you're never going to finish.  It's addictive like that; a plate of cheese that people talk around even as they pick it apart.And if you're wondering if these plates have the kind of cheese you like, then this review is for you.CUBE - People wake up in a labyrinthine cube with no idea of how they got there or why they've been kidnapped.  They must navigate through a series of deadly traps, without knowing just what it is they're headed for (or even where it is).  A doctor, a famous escapist, a cop, a mentally handicapped fella -- personalities clash, and what could've been a tight little parable of existentialism becomes a squabbling social commentary about the brutality of big, mean men.  It's tense, but not paced particularly well, although the ending has a thankful spot of hope.  Likethe Rubik's Cube, most people will find this cube compelling for a few twists and turns, but are unlikely to find the ending all that rewarding.  3 1/2 stars.CUBE 2 - HYPERCUBE- The cube has gone hyper!  Dimensional that is.  Gone is the first cube's relentless dankness, replaced here by sterile, unapologetic white.  Although the new cube is also fraught with hidden perils, these are mostly of the multidimensional variety.  What this means for you, the viewer, is that the traps are now CGI contraptions that look not convincing in the least.  It also means that many rooms have their own gravity and ""variable time speeds.""  Oh, I almost forgot, the most awesome thing it means is that it exists in multiple dimensions at once, so there are apparently about fifteen different copies of each person wandering around at the same time.Did I say ""awesome""?  I'm sorry.  I meant ""unfortunate.""  Because this cube has basically no rules, virtually anything can happen, making what DOES happen less important in the long run.  We've got some crazy characters -- a senile physicist, a blind girl, a private detective, a video game desinger and a lawyer -- and they all have connections with a scary-big corporation named Izon, but who cares?  The least plot driven of the three movies, this film is also the darkest (in spite of how well-lit each frame is).  And, of course, it succumbs to the same mistake as the first film.  Instead of being about the little people coming to terms with the bizarre futility of their circumstances, it devolves into a big man going crazy and chasing everyone around with a knife.  2 stars.CUBE ZERO- I don't know why they called this CUBE ZERO instead of CUBE CUBED.  Maybe it's supposed to be a prequel, but I doubt it.  It's possible they just thought ""zero"" sounded better than ""three.""  Or maybe it's because, for the first time ever, the viewer is treated to life outside of the cube.Don't worry.  The cube is still there, just as gloomy and lethal as ever (and in far more vividly gross ways), but the group of people inside the box are at least as important as the people watching them.  The watchers in this case are a couple of be-jumpsuited guys named Wynn and Dodd who sit around, play chess, and record people's dreams.  These guys give the series a chance to do some more overt navel-gazing, but the end effect isn't that bad, even if it mostly just feels like aPinter play.  Specifically, THE DUMBWAITER.  (Read it.  It's good.)Still, no matter how full of dread and terror his plays were, Pinter always kept the terrible and dreaded things off-stage.  When Wynn begins to question his duties, eventually taking drastic measures to get some answers, he causes chaos in and out of the cube.  Enter three of the dreaded higher-ups.  An effete and over-acted character named Jax pops in, followed closely by two well-groomed go-fers.  (Everytime Jax talked to them, I could swear he was calling them Thin and Quickly, but the credits list them as Finn and Quigley.)  They are heralded with whimsically creepy violin music, like an incidental theme song, and although they aren't fooling around, their presence makes the whole thing far less ominous than it normally would.Still, the wackiness they provde is menacing and self-assured, and it disguises a story with far more heart and smarts than its predecessors.  Even if the story contains, yet again, a big, angry man chasing people around, that is a minor part of the much larger, much more hopeful picture.  Satisfying in a lot of ways, this film also pays homage to fans who've endured the films from the beginning.  4 stars.",3,Cube Cubed,1237248000,"03 17, 2009",2009,4858,"['find', 'experiencing', 'two', 'schools', 'thought', 'when', 'tothe', 'CUBEseries', 'one', 'hand', 'are', 'poorly', 'acted', 'mostly', 'redundant', 'plots', 'predictable', 'dialogue', 'other', 'hand', 'structures', 'are', 'so', 'blatantly', 'philosophical', 'so', 'unabashadly', 'symbolic', 'kind', 'treat', 'sit', 'back', 'fiddle', 'concepts', 'Sorta', 'same', 'way', ""'d"", 'fill', 'few', 'boxes', 'crossword', 'puzzle', 'know', ""'re"", 'never', 'going', 'finish', 'addictive', 'plate', 'cheese', 'people', 'talk', 'around', 'even', 'pick', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'plates', 'have', 'kind', 'cheese', 'then', 'review', 'you.CUBE', 'People', 'wake', 'up', 'labyrinthine', 'cube', 'idea', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'why', ""'ve"", 'been', 'kidnapped', 'must', 'navigate', 'series', 'deadly', 'traps', 'knowing', 'just', 'what', ""'re"", 'headed', 'even', 'where', 'doctor', 'famous', 'escapist', 'cop', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'fella', 'personalities', 'clash', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'tight', 'little', 'parable', 'existentialism', 'squabbling', 'social', 'commentary', 'brutality', 'big', 'mean', 'men', 'tense', 'not', 'paced', 'particularly', 'well', 'ending', 'thankful', 'spot', 'hope', 'Likethe', 'Rubik', 'Cube', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'cube', 'compelling', 'few', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'unlikely', 'find', 'ending', 'rewarding', '3', '1/2', 'stars.CUBE', '2', 'HYPERCUBE-', 'cube', 'gone', 'hyper', 'Dimensional', 'Gone', 'first', 'cube', 'relentless', 'dankness', 'replaced', 'here', 'sterile', 'unapologetic', 'white', 'new', 'cube', 'also', 'fraught', 'hidden', 'perils', 'are', 'mostly', 'multidimensional', 'variety', 'What', 'viewer', 'traps', 'are', 'now', 'CGI', 'contraptions', 'look', 'not', 'convincing', 'least', 'also', 'many', 'rooms', 'have', 'own', 'gravity', 'variable', 'time', 'speeds', 'Oh', 'almost', 'forgot', 'most', 'awesome', 'thing', 'multiple', 'dimensions', 'once', 'are', 'apparently', 'fifteen', 'different', 'copies', 'person', 'wandering', 'around', 'same', 'time.Did', 'say', 'awesome', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'meant', 'unfortunate', 'cube', 'basically', 'rules', 'virtually', 'anything', 'can', 'happen', 'making', 'what', 'DOES', 'happen', 'less', 'important', 'long', 'run', ""'ve"", 'got', 'crazy', 'characters', 'senile', 'physicist', 'blind', 'girl', 'private', 'detective', 'video', 'game', 'desinger', 'lawyer', 'have', 'connections', 'scary-big', 'corporation', 'named', 'Izon', 'who', 'least', 'plot', 'driven', 'three', 'movies', 'film', 'also', 'darkest', 'spite', 'how', 'well-lit', 'frame', 'course', 'same', 'mistake', 'first', 'film', 'Instead', 'being', 'little', 'people', 'coming', 'terms', 'bizarre', 'futility', 'circumstances', 'big', 'man', 'going', 'crazy', 'chasing', 'everyone', 'knife', '2', 'stars.CUBE', 'ZERO-', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'called', 'CUBE', 'ZERO', 'instead', 'CUBE', 'CUBED', 'Maybe', 'supposed', 'be', 'prequel', 'doubt', 'possible', 'just', 'thought', 'zero', 'sounded', 'better', 'three', 'maybe', 'because', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'viewer', 'treated', 'life', 'cube.Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'cube', 'still', 'there', 'just', 'gloomy', 'lethal', 'ever', 'far', 'more', 'vividly', 'gross', 'ways', 'group', 'people', 'box', 'are', 'least', 'as', 'important', 'people', 'watching', 'watchers', 'case', 'are', 'couple', 'be-jumpsuited', 'guys', 'named', 'Wynn', 'Dodd', 'who', 'sit', 'around', 'play', 'chess', 'record', 'people', 'dreams', 'guys', 'give', 'series', 'chance', 'do', 'more', 'overt', 'navel-gazing', 'end', 'effect', ""n't"", 'bad', 'even', 'mostly', 'just', 'feels', 'aPinter', 'play', 'Specifically', 'DUMBWAITER', 'Read', 'good', 'Still', 'matter', 'how', 'full', 'dread', 'terror', 'plays', 'were', 'Pinter', 'always', 'kept', 'terrible', 'dreaded', 'things', 'off-stage', 'When', 'Wynn', 'question', 'duties', 'eventually', 'taking', 'drastic', 'measures', 'get', 'answers', 'chaos', 'cube', 'Enter', 'three', 'dreaded', 'higher-ups', 'effete', 'over-acted', 'character', 'named', 'Jax', 'pops', 'followed', 'closely', 'two', 'well-groomed', 'go-fers', 'Everytime', 'Jax', 'talked', 'could', 'swear', 'was', 'calling', 'Thin', 'Quickly', 'credits', 'list', 'Finn', 'Quigley', 'are', 'heralded', 'whimsically', 'creepy', 'violin', 'music', 'incidental', 'theme', 'song', 'are', ""n't"", 'fooling', 'around', 'presence', 'whole', 'thing', 'far', 'less', 'ominous', 'normally', 'would.Still', 'wackiness', 'provde', 'menacing', 'self-assured', 'story', 'far', 'more', 'heart', 'smarts', 'predecessors', 'Even', 'story', 'contains', 'yet', 'again', 'big', 'angry', 'man', 'chasing', 'people', 'minor', 'part', 'much', 'larger', 'much', 'more', 'hopeful', 'picture', 'Satisfying', 'lot', 'ways', 'film', 'also', 'homage', 'fans', 'who', ""'ve"", 'endured', 'films', 'beginning', '4', 'stars']",Cube
455578,A15TIGL6MKUWYU,6305238065,"Mark E. Summers ""Gamekrazy""","[0, 0]","First off, I have to say that I found this to be an interesting movie, with some well thought out twists and turns.  However, in places, it does tend to start to bog itself down, and you can start to feel the time just  dragging on.  Some of the traps are rather ingenius too, although I have  some reservations about the feasibility of some of them actually being able  to work the way they are portrayed to.Taking the acting into account  now, certainly none of the actors would win any type of award for their  performances, but I've seen B movies with much worse actors than those in  this movie, so I won't say too much bad about them.  The guy playing the  cop tended to ham it up a little too much, and one of the characters I  thought was one of the most interesting got killed much too early into the  movie.  These things happen though.I had almost been tempted to give  this movie four stars, but dropped it to three because of a lame reversal  type of gotcha ending.  For those that haven't seen this movie I don't want  to give too much away so I'll try to be vague.  In their travels through  the cube, we are treated to them opening the room doors many times, always  with a rather loud clicking and banging sound.  However, at the end,  someone is able to sneak into a room of other characters without them  hearing anything, no noises or anything.  Unbelievable.  For more than just  that reason too since this person had also been able to circumnavigate the  traps in the other rooms with no help which wasn't likely.All in all  though, I'd say this movie is at least worth the price of a rental, but not  one I'll buy to add to my collection.",3,It almost works,961977600,"06 26, 2000",2000,1661,"['First', 'have', 'say', 'found', 'be', 'interesting', 'movie', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'twists', 'turns', 'However', 'places', 'tend', 'start', 'bog', 'down', 'can', 'start', 'feel', 'time', 'just', 'dragging', 'traps', 'are', 'rather', 'ingenius', 'too', 'have', 'reservations', 'feasibility', 'actually', 'being', 'able', 'work', 'way', 'are', 'portrayed', 'to.Taking', 'acting', 'account', 'now', 'certainly', 'none', 'actors', 'would', 'win', 'type', 'award', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'B', 'movies', 'much', 'worse', 'actors', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'too', 'much', 'bad', 'guy', 'playing', 'cop', 'tended', 'ham', 'up', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'characters', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'got', 'killed', 'much', 'too', 'early', 'movie', 'things', 'happen', 'though.I', 'had', 'almost', 'been', 'tempted', 'give', 'movie', 'four', 'stars', 'dropped', 'three', 'lame', 'reversal', 'type', 'gotcha', 'ending', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'so', ""'ll"", 'try', 'be', 'vague', 'travels', 'cube', 'are', 'treated', 'opening', 'room', 'doors', 'many', 'times', 'always', 'rather', 'loud', 'clicking', 'banging', 'sound', 'However', 'end', 'someone', 'able', 'sneak', 'room', 'other', 'characters', 'hearing', 'anything', 'noises', 'anything', 'Unbelievable', 'more', 'just', 'reason', 'too', 'person', 'had', 'also', 'been', 'able', 'circumnavigate', 'traps', 'other', 'rooms', 'help', 'was', ""n't"", 'likely.All', ""'d"", 'say', 'movie', 'least', 'price', 'rental', 'not', 'one', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'add', 'collection']",Cube
455579,ASU3THM5ZUTUI,6305238065,"Mark Lee ""Peacemaker""","[3, 3]","Shot on a budget of only 365,000 dollars and taking place in only 2 adjacent rooms that light up in different colors, this 1997 independent film is about six total strangers who wake up one day in a giant maze of interlocking cubical chambers.  These people include a cop, a doctor, an escape artist, a building designer, a mathematician, and an autistic person (who doesn't come until later).  They don't know why they've been put in there, but without any food or water, they don't have long to survive, especially when they find that the maze is riddled with deadly traps.  As they use their skills to work together to find their way out, they also try to find reasons why they've been imprisoned in the Cube.Sounds cool, doesn't it?  One is tempted to write a rave review on this film just because of its unique plot.  There's no denying that ""Cube"" is a very interesting movie, and it seems like a rather promising one from the beginning.  Unfortunately, the film just doesn't blow your mind the way you'd expect it to. The acting, writing, and directing all have amateurism oozing out of their ears.All six of the characters in the film are named after prisons, but that's about as much thought that was put into them as it gets.  There was no detailed history of the characters before they woke up in the Cube.  Consequently, they are so flat and illogical that I really felt no sympathy towards those that do succumb to the Cube.  I was especially unimpressed with Maurice Dean Wint's performance as the exceptionally high-strung and unlikable cop.  Oh, and did I mention that it took the mathematician about 5 seconds to figure out whether or not the number 676 is prime?*sigh* All right, if you overlook the flat-as-a-pancake acting, you might actually feel some suspense in the first half of the film.  This notably comes into place when the prisoners have to make their way through a room where the slightest noise triggers a deadly matrix of spikes to emerge.  That's another good thing about the movie--cool special effects.  But from the midpoint and onward, the film really loses its sense of suspense and gets just plain lame when the autistic guy supplies his astronomical mathematic abilities to try to figure out the way the Cube works.  Wow, I never saw that one coming!  And another gripe: the film's incoherent dialogue also tries way too hard to be philosophical and just winds up being vague, particularly in the last few minutes of the film.Which brings me to the ending.  The ending is not only predictable, but also wholly unsatisfactory.  I won't give it away, but it leaves you feeling cheated even if for some reason you enjoyed everything else in the film.

455582,A1VID7V2TWV3AE,6305238065,"M. Dalton ""big-dummy""","[6, 7]","This is one of those movies which does make you think, and I'm not sure if most people really understand why.  Perhaps it has a different meaning to a lot of people.Many reviewers of this film...describd this film as a ""existentialist breakfast club"".  It definately is in one sense one of those genre films where different archetypes are put together to interract in an artificial environment.  But in this case, what kind of environment and why?Why would someone build this sinister cube? Is it just a plot device as many reviewers seem to assume?  The dialogue in the movie gives a clue.  The characters debate the purpose and origin of the cube.  The ""liberal nurse"" speculates it is some kind of military or military-corporate weapon.  The ""aggro cop"" assumes it's the plaything of a wealthy villian out of some James Bond movie.  But it's the ""cynical guy"" who seems to have the answers, and in my opinion really the most interesting thing to say in the movie.He angrily confronts the arguing cop and nurse, and bitterly contends, that while yes, there is a conspiracy of sorts, a conspiracy which all present participate in by playing their social roles with tunnel vision and not caring about ""the big picture""... but it's not a conspiracy that any one person or group is in charge of.  ""Big brother is NOT watching you"" he yells.It is, he seems to be saying, rather a conspiracy where the system itself has gained total control, and none of the people who have surrendered thier individuality and personal responsibility to this system, including the designers, are safe from it.  This echoes sentiments some very perspecacious social critics have voiced about the US and it's ""military-industrial complex"" including Gore Vidal and William S. Burroughs.I believe the cube is an allegory to modern life in a world  increasingly controlled by large institutions, and increasingly dangerous and predatory toward individual humans.  Many people increasingly view the large institutions which we serve or obey in one manner or many, are up to dangerous, unethical, irresponsible activities, but we depend on them nevertheless as our shelter, our source of income, to provide our safety.  The cube - maze the characters are trapped in is a kind of allegory for this system, mindless, mechanical, intermittently lethal.Even more creepy, the architect, the cynic, goes on to describe the cube specifically as being a project which took on a life of it's own, he completes the image described by the nurse, of atomized workers, firms, bureaus, working on something ... with the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing... and with no brain guiding either of them.  Something just building itself.  THis is reminiscent of the subtly creepy Stanislaw Lem book ""Eden"".I'm not certain what the ultimate conclusion is meant to be, especially the significance of the ending, but I believe the movie was made to examine these ideas.  As a Canadian film it's especially relevant.  Canadians often feel themselves to be living in the shadow of a not always so benign United States.Of course I could be wrong.  One reviewer described the nurse as a paranoid who 'brought everyone down' and felt that the cop...provided leadership and encouragement.  Perhaps this film is a Rosarch test of sorts, and you can derive many meanings from it.

One of the reasons the film seems so fresh and original is the setting.  CUBE takes place inside of a giant metal cubic structure, which is itself composed of thousands of smaller cube-like rooms.  It is possible for occupants to navigate the structure by passing from one room into adjacent cubes through portals on each a cubic room's six sides, but such travel is not without its dangers. Some of the rooms are booby-trapped with deadly devices.  And from time to time, the myriad of cubic rooms shift their positions within the larger structure.The actual story centers on a group of seven people--each with a different lifestyle and background and each therefore a stranger to the others--who awaken to find themselves together in one of the many cubic rooms, but with no recollection of how they arrived there.  They soon learn that they must reach the outside of the cube-shaped prison if they want to survive--most importantly, they have no access to food or water--and as their journey through the structure progresses, they realize that each of them has some unique talent that contributes to their ability to map a safe route through the overall structure.  However, as one might expect, they do not trust each other, and the resulting paranoia eventually leads to....Sci-Fi and STAR TREK fans will be interested in watching the excellent performance of the cute and sexy Nicole de Boer, who would later go on to recurring roles on TV's STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE and THE DEAD ZONE.  Here she portrays a gifted mathematician whose talent is central to solving the riddle of escape from the cube.  Genre fans, especially those who watch lots of TV, may also recognize Maurice Dean Wint, who plays the primary antagonist in CUBE.  He has had guest roles in numerous Sci-Fi and Horror television series, including FOREVER KNIGHT, THE OUTER LIMITS, ROBOCOP, and FRIDAY THE 13th, just to name a few.Few low-budget films are as literate or as engaging as CUBE.  What's even more impressive is that the filmmakers have created such a high-quality and entertaining Sci-Fi flick without relying on the usual inordinate amount of special FX.  A good story, an appropriate or interesting setting, and good actors--those are the basic ingredients for all successful films.  Anything else is mere window dressing.

How would you find your way out, and would you work with or against the others stuck in the puzzle with you? CUBE raises these questions, and many others, but don't expect too many answers; the cube itself is a mystery wrapped in an enigma that sort of walks in a circle around a puzzle, but the film isn't about what the cube is or where it came from. It's an examination of human nature. Locked away from society, in a moment-to-moment struggle for survival, can we retain our humanity?Unfortunately, the mystery of the cube is both the film's strength and its weakness; though the cube's existence is examined mid-way through the movie, with a somewhat shaky explanation of where it came from, we're not given all the answers. Keeping it a mystery keeps it interesting, but at the same time, doesn't really allow you to believe in the situation as much as you might need to to get really involved with what's happening on the screen.Also hampering your connection to the characters is their sheer abrasiveness; though their situation is likely to bring out the worst in anyone, it's not so much the characters as the way a few of the actors portrayed them. Maurice Dean Wint overplays pretty much every scene and Nicky Guadagni reaches whole new levels of hysteria.

455599,A157XTSMJH9XA4,6305238065,One of many,"[3, 4]","Cube was a very satisfying sci-fi/suspense flick. It is quite an experience just to watch the story unfold -- the viewer experiences everything just as the characters do. But once it's over, there's not much left you'd want to see again. And in my opinion, because of it's ending, it is a little disappointing.Without giving away the ending or any surprises, here's the basic plot: A divided group of unknown (and as far as they know, unconnected) individuals wake up in ""The Cube"" without any knowledge of how they arrived there. The Cube is a gigantic box, more or less. It has many, many revolting rooms that connect to each other through square doors on the walls, ceilings, and floors. The strangers don't know why they are there, or what they should do. They just figure they better stick together and try to make it out of there. But the confusing task of finding their way out of the gigantic maze is made much more difficult (and dangerous) because some rooms are fatal traps if you enter them, rigged with deadly sensor-sensitive devices. They must find out how to differentiate these rooms from the others before more people die (indeed, we get to see a few deaths before anyone begins to decipher the pattern). Before long, the small group is navigating their way through The Cube somewhat successfully (considering how spontaneous of a terrifying occassion this is). The ""connection"" between them is starting to make a little sense, as they all have certain jobs or talents that allow them to help out and do their part in trying to escape the massive maze. Yet surely enough, the paranoia starts to swell up in all of them and they begin suspecting one another of being a part of the horrible game. Without any food or water or outside communication, it seems that even if they're not mechanically slaughtered trying to find their way through the deadly Cube, then they might die within it.Cube is indeed an edge-of-your-seat mind-game of a film. The same questions that the characters have are the same ones you have. The isolated world of The Cube is all you know -- and it's all they have. Throughout, it's a continuous roller-coaster ride of fear, death (or at least near-death), and confusion. So why is this not a top-pick in my opinion? The ending. Don't worry, the writers knew that with such a great story and script they couldn't throw any old ending in there. It had to live up to the rest of the movie. So, instead of taking the risk of choosing an ending ""twisty""  or ""explosive"" enough (or hell, even a REVEALING ending) the writers decided to leave the audience with something peculiar: the same feeling they had at the beginning of the film. The ending is quite unexpected and equally baffling, but you can be assured that Cube is an odd way to spend your time considering how the one thing keeping you interested from beginning to end is never truly resolved. This, although, could be considered a good thing. It does leave the viewer to come up with his own theory and dabble in his own imagination. So Cube is certainly interesting. Just be sure to realize that you'll have to play along at home in order to enjoy the ending.By all means, rent it and don't buy it at first. It is a great scifi film.

455600,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,6305238065,Paperbackstash,"[0, 0]","What's cooler than a booby trapped box that kills people? Well folks, not much.Science fiction fans can rejoice, for a savior has come. The eternal well of science fiction, alien goodies, robotic creatures, and enlarging blobs has been drying up for some time; it's the perfect moment to inject some freshness into the contaminated air and clear our nasals of stinky, polluted trash. A film has finally arrived to do just that. And guess what else, on top of all this, star gazed fans? It's an original idea too!As miraculous as it is to state anything as 'original' now of days, this one is something I've never seen or read about before. Five people wake up in a room with four openings on each side. They have discovered that if you venture off into the wrong room, something morbidly horrible kills them. Be it acid in the face, dissolving bacterais, fires, you name it, it's not something they look forward to. Of the five folks, one is an expert convict who is notorious for breaking out of things. Another is a teenage girl math whiz, another an activist woman, another an ex cop with a chip on his shoulder, and another a plain guy that doesn't stand out in my head. None of them remember how they arrived there, and none of then know, at first, how the hell they're going to sruvive this rat trap and break back into freedom and normalcy.Soon they, or what's left of 'they', begin to discover the secrets of the cube. Through dangerous trial and error that's always costly, they slowly manuever their bodies through the obstacle, running into others - whether alive or dead - that may aide or hurt their journeys progress. One thing's for sure - this movie has more layers than the world's biggest onion. I was kept on my toes for the entire duration, practically spinning in my seat.Suspense? Of course it's there. Any time they entered a room you waited for the inevitable horror to strike o else tranquil calm to greet them. Would the people I grew to care about be diced into mincemeat and then swept aside with an electronic hand, or would they live to see another room? To top it all off, there is the natural tension among the group. They reminded me of a small pack of trapped animals, getting tired, getting hungry, desperate and suspicious. If you enjoy claustrophobic movies, it's easy to conclude that seeing a bunch of strange stuck in a cube is a very tight fit indeed!If, and when, death occurs, its always brutal. If I were in the shoes of the survivors, I may just end up sitting there and choosing to stave to death instead of risking those possible fates. Must be the wimp in me. You get some nasty, graphic, gruesome, icky, violent stuff that's sure to make the viewer shrink from the screen adn thank God they're in their own living rooms instead of inside with those unlucky sops.The acting doesn't come from a very well known cast, which in a way helps. It's potent for being low budget. Each holds their own weight just fine considering how much was dished out to them, adding to the tension and drama. Nicole de Boer as the braniac kid seems a bit snobby at first but does a special sort of job for the flick. Having to play such a tension filled part, she did very well. Nicky Guadagni is Helen, the activist doctor; her motivations and reactions are completely believable. Maurice Dean Wint  will most likely stand out more than the others in the end, not only because of his great acting, but also because he is one of the more interesting characters around. David Hewlett as the plain jane type of guy does what he can with a part that just isn't as interesting as the others. He's a savior of sorts and a stand up kind of guy you have to like, but the most forgettable of the group. Andrew Miller as the autistic was so convincing I thought he must really be like that in real life. Great acting there! His character adds a  unique twist to the whole deal.The beginning starts off with a man dying a horrible death and then jumps into a mysterious labyrinth that is intriguing, fascinating, confusing, and ultimately horrifying. The ending is  grim, final, and a slight bit of a shocker. The pace never slows down and the film itself always demands attention, from start to finish.Vincenzo Natali did an amazing job of directing, as it comes across perfectly bleak, dark, and serious. Cinematography was done on a low budget but it looked amazing.Can I think of anything negative to say concerning this mind-bending obstacle course? Frankly, not really. The acting is good, the plot is damn good, the deaths are cool and not overdone for the sake of being overdone (in other words, they fit), tension is there, action, drama, and intelligence - something sorely missing from many movies now of days.In short, make sure you see this science fiction/horror head case before the year is out. I took too long to view the damn thing, even after being told I should way before now. I'm glad it's finally been see as I now have another favorite to add to the shelves.Salut!",5,Excellent,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,5005,"['What', 'cooler', 'booby', 'trapped', 'box', 'people',

Also, IZON has similar cachet to Joss Whedon's Wolfram and Hart law firm (See ANGEL, the vampire on DVD).In these CUBE movies, people are caught in deadly traps, but some may actually think their way out, more or less facilitated by acts of heroism.  We're never really sure why they are placed in the traps, but it seems because of some crime they may or may not have committed, and waived immediate execution by participation in an experiment.  Hmmmmm?Suppose that the evil government may not always fail, but does always suffer with inner struggle that thwarts its ultimate success in varying degrees.  An evil government's nature is that its members have blind faith in principles at odds with nature, which principles ultimately fail or become benign under the test of time (the universe is intrinsically good and balanced).Systematic failure, such as in Cube Zero,  is predicated upon moral conscience in humans-a quality that cannot be manufactured or controlled.  (Numbed . . . maybe . . . but not controlled)  Cube Zero is about such men: Both Brainman and Chessman come to realize their dilemma by way of conscience; then they act upon it.  It costs their lives, but all this is what constitutes heroes.All the Cubes are for gory fun and entertainment.  To try to find answers in fiction to cosmic mysteries is ridiculous.  Nevertheless, to have your imagination and sense of self expanded is brilliant.  Be sure to watch Cube, Hypercube, and Cube Zero in that order, although some recommend stopping with Cube to keep a certain mystery alive.",3,"CUBE, HYPERCUBE, CUBE ZERO: Portrait of Systematic Failure ad infinitum",1136160000,"01 2, 2006",2006,1623,"['IZON', 'mysterious', 'corporation', 'taken', 'Orwell', 'book', '1984', 'Also', 'IZON', 'similar', 'cachet', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'law', 'firm', 'See', 'ANGEL', 'vampire', 'DVD', 'CUBE', 'movies', 'people', 'are', 'caught', 'deadly', 'traps', 'may', 'actually', 'think', 'way', 'more', 'less', 'facilitated', 'acts', 'heroism', ""'re"", 'never', 'really', 'sure', 'why', 'are', 'placed', 'traps', 'crime', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'committed', 'waived', 'immediate', 'execution', 'participation', 'experiment', 'Hmmmmm', 'Suppose', 'evil', 'government', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'fail', 'always', 'suffer', 'inner', 'struggle', 'ultimate', 'success', 'varying', 'degrees', 'evil', 'government', 'nature', 'members', 'have', 'blind', 'faith', 'principles', 'odds', 'nature', 'ultimately', 'fail', 'become', 'benign', 'test', 'time', 'universe', 'intrinsically', 'good', 'balanced', '.Systematic', 'failure', 'such', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'predicated', 'moral', 'conscience', 'humans-a', 'quality', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'manufactured', 'controlled', 'Numbed', 'maybe', 'not', 'controlled', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'such', 'men', 'Brainman', 'Chessman', 'come', 'realize', 'dilemma', 'way', 'conscience', 'then', 'act', 'lives', 'what', 'heroes.All', 'Cubes', 'are', 'gory', 'fun', 'entertainment', 'try', 'find', 'answers', 'fiction', 'cosmic', 'mysteries', 'ridiculous', 'Nevertheless', 'have', 'imagination', 'sense', 'self', 'expanded', 'brilliant', 'Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'Cube', 'Hypercube', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'order', 'recommend', 'stopping', 'Cube', 'keep', 'certain', 'mystery', 'alive']",Cube
455605,A3PWPNZVMNX3PA,6305238065,rareoopdvds,"[0, 0]","...I am surprised not one mentioned the Twilight Zone episode ""Five Characters In Search of an Exit"". Maybe this is obvious, and maybe some other reviewers mentioned it, but it should be noted that this film is a long version of that episode.The difference is essentially the object in which they try to escape, a cube that these characters found themselves in. Five characters who dont know each other, dont know why they are there, and have no reasonable exit for the place they find themselves stuck in. Yes, ""Cube"" is as existential as that. The cube as the metaphor for existence, while the characters ponder in various states of disarray why they were chosen to be there. This would be a highly egocentric point of view to think they were ""chosen"", would it not? It would appear from their lifes work that they chose, and even designed their lives to be there. Isn't that the metaphor? To be in a cubed room with 6 doors, all of which lead to another room of the same type? When life is running in circles, everything is the same. There are smags and snares that will kill you, but if you know WHAT to be aware of, you can avoid it.The five characters each have distinct personality traits and skills are utitlized to help them towards an exit. They eventually stumble on math theories based on numbers between doorways. They soon discover that these numbers are equations based on Cartesian geometry that can help one to understatd the design of the entire cube. This eventually only proves to be half right, while the larger scope is to break down a 9 digit number into factorials. If we recall Abbot's ""Flatland"", we can appreciate this in the sense of perception. That when the world is flat, everything is 2 dimensional. That is what the world of Cartesian geometry implies. To move forward, one needs to begin to think in three-dimensions and understand the whole from all points of view, and not just front/back. Once our young heroine discovers this, she has the ability to know where the exit is.The film in general is predictable, because the point was less to find out the exit of the cube and more to explore the existential questions of existence. Whether this be through logic, emotion or the senses, the characters begin to unravel and show their own true colors, and their own meanings. Its a sort of logotherapy set in a world by Samuel Beckett.""Cube"" offers many philosphical debates for the viewer who is interested in taking the time to examine its message, but if you are looking for home-spun entertainment, then you will be let down. If not from its heavy-handed philosophy, then by its monotony. I did not like the film entirely because it put the viewer in a double bind: to expect the audience to accept the alien world we are tossed in, yet if you did not enjoy the film because there was nothing to relate to, then you would be missing the point.

Not many people could come up with ANY movie only using a single room. Vincenzo Natali gives us a great view of what can be done with only a handful of unknown actors, a low budget, and one cubic room.Here's how it starts: all the characters wake up in different cubed rooms, which we assume are all part of one giant cube (which is later confirmed). They come together and must figure out how to survive long enough to get out of a seemingly endless maze of room, all colored differently. Did I mention that some rooms are boobytrapped?Now they have to navigate the rooms, figuring out along the way where they should go and how to avoid the traps. Right when they think they've got it figured out, something pops up that proves them wrong. The group starts to get desperate after a while with no food or water.The movie plays out like a huge psychological experiment. When the characters are in cool colored rooms such as blue or green, they are calm and don't mind working together. But, when they are in warm colored rooms like red or orange (which seems to happen more often near the end of the movie), they become aggitated and easily annoyed.Thankfully, the only information the writers give away about the Cube is what we need to know to survive, and all the rest is left for us to ponder. Who made it? How did they make it? Why did they make it? All of these questions are left unanswered.While the ending angered many people, I thought it was just right. The acting went over well, although Maurice Dean Wint (Quentin) may have been a bit overbearing, and the character, I thought, was a little too quick to anger.All in all, an excellent movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat, as well as have you asking questions when it is done.

as Dr. Helen Holloway,David Hewlett as David Worth,Andrew Miller as Kazan,Wayne Robson as Rennes(One Magic Christmas,as the guy who hijacks the children),and Julian Richings as Alderson.It is a grand study in paranoia,fear of the unknown and human beings reduced to the simplest of equations in so far as their emotional stability goes.It is instinctual and at times raw and unnerving to watch as the group`s numbers dwindle and they spiral ever downwards within themselves.The film begins as an unknown man is lying on a floor in a square/cubed room.He gets up,takes a few steps then is sliced and diced by a swift moving steel metal sieve.He literally falls to pieces before our eyes.It is certainly a disturbing harbinger of what is to come.The film progresses to introducing us to a group of individuals who eventually all come together,and work on a way of trying to get out of their strange dilemma.They put forth their own personal theories as to the whys of their predicament,ranging from an alien kidnapping to a government run conspiracy.Among the group there is a doctor,an ex con,a cop,a student,an autistic savant and one of the actual creators of part of the structure they now stand in.He apparently worked on the outer shell,and was in communication with others working on the project,but none knew what the ultimate design was nor the others names.The student utilizes her math skills to get the group going from one safe room to another,as each are numbered and some rooms are booby trapped.Time passes on and the group starts to dwindle and tempers flare and extreme paranoia and fear touches each one in different ways.They eventually learn they are all in a giant cube,with a myriad of other cubes that constantly move.They also figure out that the original cube they started from was the one they should have stayed in in the first place.They get back to that location,and in time the room comes to a halt at a portal that they may escape from,which exudes white

The focus is on the ways in which the characters interact,  although obstacles can be thrown in their way to push that interaction, but  most of the time that device is used when the author has run out of good  ideas.Let's take that idea and turn it on its head-- the characters  wake up in a situation, but instead of the focus being on the characters,  the focus is on the space in which they wake up, and much of their  interaction is based on figuring out what, exactly, their space consists  of, and how to survive moving around in it.This is the basis-- I  can't really call it, or anything else in it, a plot-- of Cube, a Sci-Fi  Channel original (interesting that some of the language is still cut out of  this). We open with a scene completely unrelated to the rest of the film  that gives us, in no uncertain terms, the idea that being in the Cube is  deadly. (Strike one, since this could easily be done by Rennes in the next  scene-- in fact, it is.) Then we meet the five original characters-- a  policeman, a doctor, an escape artist, a mathematician, and an office  worker (whose function, which is found out later on, constitutes a  spoiler)-- who find themselves in the Cube. True to form, they don't know  how they got there, where they are, etc. They spend a little time  theorizing, but not much. Both the cop and the escape artist have had  brushes with the many deadly traps to be found in the Cube. The five are  forced to band together, despite mostly hating one another, in order to  find a way out, assuming one exists.While the interaction between  the characters is interesting, and takes a number of twists Sartre might  never have considered (and one, in pariticular, that comes out of nowhere,  but shows the inventiveness of both one of the characters and the  scriptwriter), we spend as much time as the characters do attempting to  figure out the mechanics of the Cube itself. And if you like mathematical  puzzles (have any Jim Fixx books?), you'll have a ball with this movie.  There are enough clues for you to figure out what's going on, although I  certainly didn't. And the characters are passably (some even well-) acted,  and they act their parts the way their parts are written-- as second-stage  to the scenery.

Brainless entertainment for a bad night, in other words.  To my surprise this turned  out to be an unusual and very interesting little film.It makes no  apologies for its low budget (one set, some lights, and some models).  The  film works more as theatre than film (fulfills the traditional unities,  etc) and has an &quot;actors' workshop&quot; atmosphere rather than the  &quot;beauty contest&quot; ambience of a lot of low budger actioners.  The  actors are working on acting rather than on their hair.  In other words,  this film has the feel of an honest dramatic effort.The script, not the  FX, is what drives the film. It's mostly good writing, offering a fair  amount of surprises, some philosophical ventures, and even a little  literary style (what a concept).  Whether intentionally or not, the film  deconstructs the Hollywood actioner scene by scene.  Central to this  deconstruction is of course the crumbling facade of the Schwarzenegger-like  &quot;hero&quot;, as the script reveals more and more home truths about the  kind of bully boys that Hollywood persists in glorifying.This film is  being sold under false pretences:  it's way, way better than the niche  where it's being marketed.

If we took the chicken/egg debate and applied it to the two Saw sequel movies versus Cube, obviously 1997's Cube comes out the winner in the which came first contest. So perhaps there was some Cube influence on the Saw sequel directors for turning James Wan's 4-star original Saw movie into what came out more closely to Cube sequels.At least the Saw sequels made an attempt to explain why their characters were in the situations that they were thrust into and who was doing the thrusting. Cube presents no such explanations, which leaves the viewer unsatisfied when the credits roll. Cube has one of those endings where right before the credits roll you sense it's the end, but say out loud, ""Oh, this better not be the end.""Cube has some good suspense as the captors move from room to room trying to escape booby-trapped rooms throughout the prison that they all woke up inside one day without knowing how they got there. And there is also good suspense as to the explanation of the what and where exactly the Cube is. I'm still waiting in suspense on the what and where as I write.Perhaps the answers are in 2002's Cube II or 2004's Cube Zero prequel?

Some of these rooms have deadly booby traps.  This is the premise of Cube, one of the most original and exciting science fiction movies of recent years.The film succeeds on many levels.  The premise is intriguing and facilitates an absolutely brilliant, and cheap, set deisign.  All the rooms are the same except for color.  This creates a stagnation that is generally avoided, but works beautifully here to reenforce the intended feeling of frantic claustrophobia.Despite its harsh and inhuman setting, or perhaps because of it, Cube exudes a vital humanism that is, at times, even a little overbearing.  The small sample of people become a microcosm of society.  Because their interactions are so immediate and their circumststance so dire, the characters are allowed to explore practically every aspect of social interaction in society.  There's the white liberal doctor, the young college student, the invalid, the criminal, the cynical worker bee, and the male authority figure - a cop with serious insecurities and tendencies towards violence.  Ultimately, the film makes an argument for cooperation and understanding - We're all in the same boat, let's help each other - that kind of thing.  Call it Christianity or Communism, I like it either way.This hopefulness for humanity is contrasted with the complete pointlessness of the situation.  The question ""why"" is asked constantly, and it is never answered, giving Cube an existential bent.  More particularly, Cube is the epitome of kafkaesque.  It makes an obvious statement about the banality of endless beaurocracy that can often support Fascism.  However blatantly, Cube makes a powerful statement about blind acceptance of illogical constructs.There are a couple of flaws worth pointing out.  There are times that the dialogue gets clumsy and some of the performances are distracting.

455625,A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP,6305238065,Takis Tz.,"[1, 2]","Ah, but the above question has no correct answer as most good questions in this life don't. The Cube offers the situation with all its detail and intrigue, it offers the questions, the dillemas, the pondering and the eerie suspicions.But its real thrill is that it offers no answers. The answers are all up to you to come with (if you wish), but even if you do you'll never be confirmed plus you'll find that mostly everyone else might disagree with you.The five humans that (basically) wake up to find out they've been transported unknowingly to a strange and evil-feeling mechanic environment (the &quot;cube&quot;) do what anyone would try to do:they try to come out. To escape.But as they realise that the cube is not only a massively compartmentalised prison but also one laced with lethal traps mostly everywhere they decide to put their brains a little bit more to use. But this doesnt seem to help much either. Because figuring out how to come out of the cube while simoultaneously not dying in the process is difficult and offsetting enough.But the real torturing part for the protagonists is not all that. It's the questions themselves. If you know why you're in a prison, what the purpose of that prison is, who's set it up and what the overall scheme is, you might go about your efforts with a more collected mind.Yes, but you see, the prisoners of the cube know nothing.Not only the know zilch about the cube but also nothing about each other, and, as they eventually are forced to admit, not much about themselves either.The Cube is undoubtedly one of the best sci-fi films of all time. Some have criticized the acting level in it but in my opinion it is the acting that actually makes it all the more convincing. The fact that none of these actors is a &quot;name&quot; is an added plus. It emphasizes that this could be you, or, that indeed this might you at this very moment. The fact that you feel sure you &quot;know&quot; where you are and what you're doing there is the same thing these people thought too. Usually all it takes is a more careful look and the Cube starts appearing in all types of shapes and forms all around you. Spooky? Nah, reality isnt spooky, it's what's beyond it that is.Filmed on a somewhat low budget but with brilliantly fitting and believable settings as well as pretty good effects for the money available this movie has &quot;classic&quot; written all over it.Besides, even if the technical part wasn't (or isn't) totally up to par this would hardly take anything away from this masterpiece. It's not about how flashy the cube is or how &quot;cool&quot; the victims inside it are, is it? Nobody with enough suspicion in him cares about that. It's, as i said, the questions that matter.Go on and discover those questions too if you've somehow managed not to ask yourself about them till now.

Actually, it's a remake of an old Twilight Zone episode(#79, season 1.  Five Characters in search of an Exit&#34;).  They've expanded the complexity of the trap and developed the charaters, but it's basicly the same story.  Five people wake up in a type of prison.  They don't know how they got there or why.  They must find a way out before they die of starvation.What I liked about the film is overshadowed by what I didn't like about it, the antagonist.  There is one charater who becomes increasingly aggressive and violent to the point where he is difficult to watch and frankly, destroys the ending.  It seems like the author(s) had a good idea and ran out of steam half way thru.  The rest of the charaters interact to learn eachother's talents which they must utilize to stay alive and attempt escape.  Everyone present has a role to play to this end.

455633,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,6305238065,trebe,"[0, 0]","With a rather minimalist approach kind of reminiscent of 70's era science fiction, Cube (1997) is a fantasy adventure where a number of individuals are trapped in a very strange environment, and struggle to work together to find a way out.  How the people got there and why, are questions that are never addressed, as the film primarily focuses on survival in the present.The construct consists of a series of interlocked cubed shaped `rooms' of different colors.  There is a hatch in the middle of each of the six sides in each room, with a short tunnel leading to a similar cube shaped room.  There are traps in some of the rooms, so determining which rooms are `safe', becomes a key for the survivors.  The group are strangers to each other, and not much is revealed about their backgrounds.  Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint) claims to be cop, Leaven (Nicole de Boer) is a student adept in mathematics, Holloway (Nicky Guadagni) is a doctor, Rennes (Wayne Robson) is a button sucking convict, and Worth (David Hewlett) is a man who knows more than he is telling.Having no food or water, provides some motivation for escape, and when one of them is killed in a trap, safety becomes the primary concern.  The series of numbers engraved in each of the tunnels, becomes the key to their movements.  Her facility with numbers, makes Joan the one who determines which way they go.  Along the way, they find Kazan (Andrew Miller), an autistic man who proves to be something of an idiot savant when it comes to numbers.  Eventually, the group discovers that they are in a huge cubic construct made up of thousands of interconnected cube shaped rooms, that actually shift positions periodically.  Even when they succeed in reaching a room that is on the edge, they find that escape is still not possible.According to Vincent Natali (Splice), who wrote the original story and also directs, the story having no context was a critical element.  As so little is known about the characters, you tend to float along with them, and take things as they come.  The film does a good job of putting you there in the cube with the survivors, as they struggle to come together and understand their situation.  After a long journey, things starts to deteriorate under stress, and the characters turn on each other.  The evolution of the various relationships is quite fascinating.  While not entirely credible, the violence adds some interest, and takes the story to its conclusion.The acting is generally good, with Nicole de Boer, Nicky Guadagni, and Andrew Miller, perhaps doing the best jobs.  Cube has an interesting premise, with a solid and creative story built around it.  Shooting most of the scenes using the same room, the film was innovative at the time, and still holds up well today, although with a relatively low level of action, and the requirement that the audience use their brain some, Cube may not capture the fancy of those who are expecting slick special effects.  Thus far there have been two more Cube films, Cube 2: Hypercube (2003), and Cube Zero (2004), which is a prequel to the original film.",4,"""a headless blunder operating  under the illusion of a master plan...""",1310860800,"07 17, 2011",2011,3097,"['rather', 'minimalist', 'approach', 'kind', 'reminiscent', '70', 'era', 'science', 'fiction', 'Cube', '1997', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'where', 'number', 'individuals', 'are', 'trapped', 'very', 'strange', 'environment', 'struggle', 'work', 'together', 'find', 'way', 'out', 'How', 'people', 'got', 'there', 'why', 'are', 'questions', 'are', 'never', 'addressed', 'film', 'primarily', 'survival', 'present.The', 'construct', 'series', 'interlocked', 'cubed', 'shaped', 'rooms', 'different', 'colors', 'hatch', 'middle', 'six', 'sides', 'room', 'short', 'tunnel', 'leading', 'similar', 'cube', 'shaped', 'room', 'are', 'traps', 'rooms', 'determining', 'rooms', 'are', 'safe', 'key', 'survivors', 'group', 'are', 'strangers', 'other', 'not', 'much', 'revealed', 'backgrounds', 'Quentin', 'Maurice', 'Dean', 'Wint', 'be', 'cop', 'Leaven', 'Nicole', 'de', 'Boer', 'student', 'adept', 'mathematics', 'Holloway', 'Nicky', 'Guadagni', 'doctor', 'Rennes', 'Wayne', 'Robson', 'button', 'sucking', 'convict', 'Worth', 'David', 'Hewlett', 'man', 'who', 'more', 'telling.Having', 'food', 'water', 'motivation', 'escape', 'when', 'one', 'killed', 'trap', 'safety', 'primary', 'concern', 'series', 'numbers', 'engraved', 'tunnels', 'key', 'movements', 'facility', 'numbers', 'Joan', 'one', 'who', 'way', 'go', 'way', 'find', 'Kazan', 'Andrew', 'Miller', 'autistic', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'something', 'idiot', 'savant', 'when', 'numbers', 'Eventually', 'group', 'are', 'huge', 'cubic', 'construct', 'made', 'thousands', 'interconnected', 'cube', 'shaped', 'rooms', 'actually', 'shift', 'positions', 'periodically', 'Even', 'when', 'succeed', 'reaching', 'room', 'edge', 'find', 'escape', 'still', 'not', 'possible.According', 'Vincent', 'Natali', 'Splice', 'who', 'wrote', 'original', 'story', 'also', 'directs', 'story', 'having', 'context', 'was', 'critical', 'element', 'so', 'little', 'known', 'characters', 'tend', 'float', 'along', 'take', 'things', 'come', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'putting', 'cube', 'survivors', 'struggle', 'come', 'together', 'understand', 'situation', 'long', 'journey', 'things', 'starts', 'deteriorate', 'stress', 'characters', 'turn', 'other', 'evolution', 'various', 'relationships', 'quite', 'fascinating', 'not', 'entirely', 'credible', 'violence', 'interest', 'story', 'conclusion.The', 'acting', 'generally', 'good', 'Nicole', 'de', 'Boer', 'Nicky', 'Guadagni', 'Andrew', 'Miller', 'perhaps', 'doing', 'best', 'jobs', 'Cube', 'interesting', 'premise', 'solid', 'creative', 'story', 'built', 'Shooting', 'most', 'scenes', 'using', 'same', 'room', 'film', 'was', 'innovative', 'time', 'still', 'up', 'well', 'today', 'relatively', 'low', 'level', 'action', 'requirement', 'audience', 'use', 'brain', 'Cube', 'may', 'not', 'capture', 'fancy', 'who', 'are', 'expecting', 'slick', 'special', 'effects', 'Thus', 'far', 'have', 'been', 'two', 'more', 'Cube', 'films', 'Cube', '2', 'Hypercube', '2003', 'Cube', 'Zero', '2004', 'prequel', 'original', 'film']",Cube

Each of the seven prisoners has a unique personality, background, and skill set; can they work together to solve the riddle of the cube and escape?  I thought this was a very interesting idea for a film and is largely driven by character development among and interaction between the prisoners.  In the end though, the characters are so unrealistic and uncompelling that there is little to hold your attention.  The maze, or Cube, consists of a series of interconnected rooms.  Each room contains six doors, one on each wall, one on the floor, and one on the ceiling.  Some of the rooms contain deadly traps that the group must figure out how to avoid.  They must also figure out how to exit the maze.  The six persons trapped in the maze include a college math student, an autistic man, a policeman, a doctor, a fugitive from prison, and an architect.  Initially the story is very compelling:  why are they in the maze?  who selected these individuals?  who built the maze?  how do they get out?  A tense, claustrophobic atmosphere is created as we learn some initial details about the maze and about the prisoners.  As the story develops though, the characters start arguing amongst themselves, ultimately fighting each other.  The nature of the arguments is silly, and in the end I couldn't wait for the film to be over.  Once they figure out how to escape, the film turns into more of an escape/evasion type of story as some try to leave the other(s) behind.  The writers and producer took this film into a pit from which it couldn't recover.  Some of the most enthusiastic reviews claim that this film is a microcosm of society or other such nonsense.  Balderdash.  The most enthusiastic reviews grossly overstate the quality of this film.

It looks like the saw2 start is from this movie. A bunch of people find themselves imprisoned in a room. Only later they discover they are in a maze of umpteen such rooms. There is a devastating start to the movie with a booby trap which I wont give away. So the prisoners then try to understand why they are in these sets of rooms and who put them here. At first they believe that the rooms are rigged with booby traps at random which is later disproved and they find that there is a logic to the traps. The rooms that are booby trapped have the room numbers as prime numbers. There are a 2 significant people in the room who are important characters to be able to esacape the maze, A mental math gymnast girl and an autistic guy who is dumb is all other respects but can provide the factors for large numbers. There are suspicions within the group and a character changes from down right good guy to down right villain. The movie could have done with more gore. But after the first 2 traps and the gory outcomes for the victims, the movie goes into a sci-fi mode where it becomes more of a mystery-scifi-thriller where they are trying to guess the architecuture and the movement of these maze of cubes. The outside world is shown as bright light or darkness. It is upto us to assume where this cube might me. Also the creators of the cube is kept as a mystery. The natural assumption of the viewer would be that since this construct or maze of cubes is so huge it is either the work of a very powerful organisation such as the govermnment, possibly a clandestine government experiment or it could be that they are have been transported by ET's' into another world. Anyway that is upto out own imaginations. Not explaining everything gives it the movie this unexplained twilight zone touch. This movie is now a cult classic. THe movie was made on a low budget and the whole movie was shot with 2 sets.

It's almost ten years old as of this writing, and I never heard of it, and it's really good. I mean, Really Good, in lots of ways. It's got characters I can really care about. There's Leaven, for one (Nicole de Boer, aka Dax of DS9). She starts out as the stereotypical wimpy, screamy girl. Then there's Quentin, who starts out the take-charge cop, the one you're sure will get our little band out of this lethal labyrinth. Just keep two things in mind. First, everyone changes over the course of the movie. Second, wanting to see some jerk get it is also a kind of caring, just not a nice one.The way the characters change is another thing to like. This movie borders on the minimalist, and its fair to say they didn't spend a terrible lot on sets and props. The characters carry everything, and do it surprisingly well. This isn't a Great Movie in the sense of literary snobishness, but still a heck of a flick. The actors, plus the script they're given to work with, really make the movie. Another bit to like is that spending thing - they didn't do much. The actors are all good, but not in the gazillion-dollar class. Sets and props are well done, but there's not much to them. Costuming couldn't have cost more than $20 for each of seven actors. All this proves that money doesn't make a movie: artists and artistic vision do. Maybe money helps, but Cube shows that you can still get a big-budget feel on a very modest budget.What's not to like? The ending. I'll let you get there on your own. Maybe that's why this movie didn't take off and make a boatload of money for everyone involved. But, they didn't spend a lot, so I hope they all went happily to the bank anyway.
