1360011,A1LBIZLET9CW1I,B003R0MF7G,A fellow with a keyboard,"[1, 2]","I lived in Wilmington, NC, where One Tree Hill was filmed, and I was fortunate to get an in-depth, behind-the-scenes look at what made the show so special.First, the production value was tremendous. You have never seen a group of people so meticulous in their craft. Every scene had to have exactly the right lighting, and every nano-nugget of dialogue had to be repeated thousands of times until the nuance was just... perfect, so that when Peyton said ""why hello,"" you knew she meant it, and it struck you on some primal level.I also overheard some of the discussions in the writers' room. It was phenomenal, like being in a beehive of genius, where every little writer bee would cross-pollinate the ideas of the others, and they would work relentlessly all in the service of the Queen. You. You are the queen. The 12-18-y-o girls who watch One Tree Hill are the queen, the honey to their comb. I've seen some of the writer bees at home with their wives and, seriously, all they can think about is you. It's kind of creepy. (Needless to say, this makes the wives a little fidgety, but they put up with it because they know it's only 9 seasons.)Just to paint the writers' room for you, one writer bee would say something like, ""How about `oh but Lucas, you are the sun to my stars'?"" and another writer bee would fire back, ""Are you kidding? 12-18-y-o girls don't go for that. They want real dialogue, not cheesy bedtime fairytales. How about `oh but Lucas, you know I won't go for that--I'm a tough, modern gal who can buy her own iPods'?"" and another writer bee would fire back, ""Gal? Really? Is this the 19th Century?"" And so on.I wish you could have seen the way the crew operated on set. Utter professionals. None of them were blessed with movie star good-looks - most of them had a saggy gut and were balding, and for some odd reason they were almost always carrying a half-peeled Snickers Bar - but you've never seen a group of guys so in tune with the modern young-female psyche. Even during their off hours, you'd find them reading pre-teen fashion blogs, trying to understand you, your essence. Such devotion to craft.One time - and I think this says it all - I walked in on the ""testing"" room, where they had a small horde of young females stationed in front of a TV and hooked up to galvanic skin response sensors. The crew would present various scenarios on the TV - Chad Michael Murray with a varsity jacket, Chad Michael Murray without a varsity jacket; Rape scene in a basement, Rape scene at the prom - and then they'd scientifically analyze the results from the skin sensors to determine which permutations elicited the highest physiological arousal. The whole point, you see, was to maximize arousal, to make you as lustful or as disturbed as possible. And what really made One Tree Hill unique was the professionalism and dedication, the almost clinical way in which they went about their business. It's why the show will go down in the pantheon of not just the greatest shows ever, but of the greatest artistic productions period.

1360021,A3055E4D6180O9,B003R0MF7G,Eric C. Darsow,"[0, 0]","Review: even though there are hundreds of television shows that triggers the audience every hour and minute One Tree Hill is an outstanding show, because there are steady characters, fantastic actors and the whole family can watch and enjoy the unraveling and upbeat moments of a superior production.One Tree Hill has numerous age groups throughout the series. The show airs six days a week. On weekdays it's on from 1:00p.m. to 3:00p.m. and starts at 7:00a.m on Saturdays, which is shown on soapnet. Characters are Bethany Joy Lenz as Haley James Scott, Sophia Bush as Brook Davis, James Lafferty as Nathan Scott, and many more.I never watched soapnet, but one day I was scrolling through channels and caught a glimpse of  One Tree Hill during ""Breakfast in bed"" and become instantly hooked. In 2009, I became addicted and have been watching every episode since.The actors are phenomenal and continue to surprise me with qualities their characters show that you've never seen before. By watching the hard workers during their performance, nothing but talent shines through the screen.Not only are they great characters, there is never a replacement character. Throughout nine complete seasons there are consistent actors. If there is ever a time were the characters quite or leave there are brand new names that have separate personality and features.If you currently have children and you're flipping through channels and want to watch a show that the entire family can enjoy. One Tree Hill is the one. The ratings are PG-13, there is a minimum of sexual activity and vaguer language. It's filled with dram and violence without the access fat.Being so obsessed is not likely for me, but this is a television show that I will miss dearly. This is the final season that One Tree Hill airs new episodes. After an amazing run on television network One Tree Hill is coming to an end. Fortunately, it's not over yet!You can either buy the complete series or watch reruns on TV. If you have ever seen One Tree Hill, just waiting on satellite will be nerve racking. If you're someone who enjoys romantic scenes, family time means a lot to you, and you value friendship, this is the TV-series for you.",5,"""Dramatic, mysterious, and interesting Movie""",1333497600,"04 4, 2012",2012,2194,"['Review', 'even', 'are', 'hundreds', 'television', 'shows', 'audience', 'hour', 'minute', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'outstanding', 'show', 'are', 'steady', 'characters', 'fantastic', 'actors', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'unraveling', 'upbeat', 'moments', 'superior', 'production.One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'numerous', 'age', 'groups', 'series', 'show', 'six', 'days', 'week', '1:00p.m', '3:00p.m', '7:00a.m', 'Saturdays', 'shown', 'soapnet', 'Characters', 'are', 'Bethany', 'Joy', 'Lenz', 'Haley', 'James', 'Scott', 'Sophia', 'Bush', 'Brook', 'Davis', 'James', 'Lafferty', 'Nathan', 'Scott', 'many', 'more.I', 'never', 'watched', 'soapnet', 'one', 'day', 'was', 'scrolling', 'channels', 'caught', 'glimpse', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'Breakfast', 'bed', 'become', 'instantly', 'hooked', '2009', 'became', 'addicted', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'episode', 'since.The', 'actors', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'continue', 'surprise', 'qualities', 'characters', 'show', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'watching', 'hard', 'workers', 'performance', 'nothing', 'talent', 'shines', 'screen.Not', 'only', 'are', 'great', 'characters', 'never', 'replacement', 'character', 'nine', 'complete', 'seasons', 'are', 'consistent', 'actors', 'ever', 'time', 'were', 'characters', 'quite', 'leave', 'are', 'brand', 'new', 'names', 'have', 'separate', 'personality', 'features.If', 'currently', 'have', 'children', ""'re"", 'flipping', 'channels', 'want', 'watch', 'show', 'entire', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'one', 'ratings', 'are', 'PG-13', 'minimum', 'sexual', 'activity', 'vaguer', 'language', 'filled', 'dram', 'violence', 'access', 'fat.Being', 'so', 'obsessed', 'not', 'likely', 'television', 'show', 'will', 'miss', 'dearly', 'final', 'season', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'new', 'episodes', 'amazing', 'run', 'television', 'network', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'coming', 'end', 'Fortunately', 'not', 'over', 'yet', 'can', 'either', 'buy', 'complete', 'series', 'watch', 'reruns', 'TV', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'just', 'waiting', 'satellite', 'will', 'be', 'nerve', 'racking', ""'re"", 'someone', 'who', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'family', 'time', 'lot', 'value', 'friendship', 'TV-series']",One Tree Hill:S8 (DVD)

The season definitely lacked fan favorite Dan Scott. Would have been nice to see the lovable Grubbs again. Chase becomes a series regular with Alex and Mia fighting for his affection. He's fine, but what is with all the focus on Chuck? Kid's a bit of a pain and too much wasted time and storylines. The Brucas wedding was a lovely episode which did make me choke up a bit. Brooke has grown up, and she loses her clothing line, unfortunately, and becomes a bit of a dull storyline. Naley are still cheesy- miss their old days, and Haley gives birth to Lydia. There was a wonderful potential with Nathan's professor's son, who seemed like he could have been Nathan 2.0 aka from jerk to decent guy, until we find out his dark secret.
