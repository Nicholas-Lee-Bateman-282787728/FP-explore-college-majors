23046,A11JZYOPFMDGXW,076785344X,"A Quiet Conscience ""Q.C.""","[46, 51]","I passed by ""Girl"" at the video store on more than once occasion because the box didn't look all that interesting. Finally I decided to give it a shot, and I found that it's one of the true gems out there. It's definitely a keeper.Andrea Marr (Dominique Swain) is 18 and about to graduate from high school. Her best friend Cybil is an aspiring rock star who performs with a couple of mutual friends (Chris Masterton from Malcolm in the Middle and David Moscow from Newsies) and is well on her way to being discovered.Andrea is only mildly interested in her friend's stardom, because she is totally obsessed with local hot guy rock star, Todd Sparrow (Sean Patrick Flannery). She goes to all of his concerts and eventually they do hook up.Because Andrea is so into Todd, she doesn't realize that when Cybil sings a love song she's singing it about Andrea. Cybil is in love with Andrea but this fact is slowly revealed through the film and oblivious Andrea has to be hit in the head with a brick to even notice. Even her other friend's  (Selma Blair, painfully anorexic looking and well cast) bulimia is pushed aside for the great Todd Sparrow.Andrea navigates the whole underground rock scene, exuding pure joy because this guy Todd notices her...and sleeps with her. After they have sex in a horse stall in a dirty barn after a concert, Andrea's voice over tells us she ""feels like a princess."" This film has got a great handle on the neediness of young girls and how much value they put on a guy's opinion. It explores how a girl can easily let a guy overshadow her, and how she puts him on a pedestal whether he deserves to be there or not. Like it or not, girls act like this. The film is honest and raw in its portrayal.Andrea does wake up from her fantasy of being ""Todd's girl."" She finds her own identity and recognizes the fact that her worth is not measured by how she's judged by men, but by how she sees herself.My favorite characters here are Cybil and Rebecca (Summer Phoenix). Cybil is just too cute with all her crazy hairstyles and that dry comeback to everyone's compliments (""It doesn't matter.""). Rebecca is Andrea's sort- of guide through the ""underworld"" of guys, music and pop culture.""Girl"" isn't exactly like the book, but for what it is it's better than 99% of the teen tripe that's being produced these days which make teens look like [jerks]. This film shows how hard choices can be, how overwhelming love is, and how much teens really just want to be accepted and allowed to simply live without constant peer pressure and judgement. And in the end, it shows that they do learn from their mistakes and can be redeemed as they grow into adulthood.(I gave this 4 stars out of 5 because I really hated all of the Todd Sparrow songs.)",4,Honest View of Teen Thought and Activity,1024704000,"06 22, 2002",2002,2757,"['passed', 'Girl', 'video', 'store', 'more', 'once', 'occasion', 'box', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'interesting', 'Finally', 'decided', 'give', 'shot', 'found', 'one', 'true', 'out', 'there', 'definitely', 'keeper.Andrea', 'Marr', 'Dominique', 'Swain', '18', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'best', 'friend', 'Cybil', 'aspiring', 'rock', 'star', 'who', 'couple', 'mutual', 'friends', 'Chris', 'Masterton', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', 'David', 'Moscow', 'Newsies', 'well', 'way', 'being', 'discovered.Andrea', 'only', 'mildly', 'interested', 'friend', 'stardom', 'totally', 'obsessed', 'local', 'hot', 'guy', 'rock', 'star', 'Todd', 'Sparrow', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flannery', 'concerts', 'eventually', 'do', 'hook', 'up.Because', 'Andrea', 'so', 'Todd', ""n't"", 'realize', 'when', 'Cybil', 'love', 'song', 'singing', 'Andrea', 'Cybil', 'love', 'Andrea', 'fact', 'slowly', 'revealed', 'film', 'oblivious', 'Andrea', 'be', 'hit', 'head', 'brick', 'even', 'notice', 'Even', 'other', 'friend', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'painfully', 'anorexic', 'looking', 'well', 'cast', 'bulimia', 'pushed', 'aside', 'great', 'Todd', 'Sparrow.Andrea', 'whole', 'underground', 'rock', 'scene', 'exuding', 'pure', 'joy', 'guy', 'Todd', 'sleeps', 'have', 'sex', 'horse', 'stall', 'dirty', 'barn', 'concert', 'Andrea', 'voice', 'tells', 'feels', 'princess', 'film', 'got', 'great', 'handle', 'neediness', 'young', 'girls', 'how', 'much', 'value', 'put', 'guy', 'opinion', 'how', 'girl', 'can', 'easily', 'let', 'guy', 'how', 'pedestal', 'be', 'there', 'not', 'not', 'girls', 'act', 'film', 'honest', 'raw', 'portrayal.Andrea', 'wake', 'up', 'fantasy', 'being', 'Todd', 'girl', 'own', 'identity', 'fact', 'worth', 'not', 'measured', 'how', 'judged', 'men', 'how', 'herself.My', 'favorite', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'Cybil', 'Rebecca', 'Summer', 'Phoenix', 'Cybil', 'just', 'too', 'cute', 'crazy', 'hairstyles', 'dry', 'comeback', 'everyone', 'compliments', ""n't"", 'matter.', 'Rebecca', 'Andrea', 'sort-', 'guide', 'underworld', 'guys', 'music', 'pop', 'culture', 'Girl', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'book', 'what', 'better', '99', '%', 'teen', 'tripe', 'being', 'produced', 'days', 'make', 'teens', 'look', '[', 'jerks', ']', 'film', 'how', 'hard', 'choices', 'can', 'be', 'how', 'overwhelming', 'love', 'how', 'much', 'teens', 'really', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'accepted', 'allowed', 'simply', 'live', 'constant', 'peer', 'pressure', 'judgement', 'end', 'do', 'learn', 'mistakes', 'can', 'be', 'redeemed', 'grow', 'adulthood', 'gave', '4', 'stars', '5', 'really', 'hated', 'Todd', 'Sparrow', 'songs']",Girl
23047,A3OUNPPWYVAWIH,076785344X,Chris Maverick,"[3, 4]","There are two things of note about the movie &quot;Girl&quot;.The first is the story itself. This is a brilliant character study. We are given a wonderful glimpse into the life of Andrea, a young woman coming to grips with her womanhood, her adulthood and her sexuality. She learns, as the film teaches the audience, that while linked the three are distinctly different. Andrea learns to differentiate between the states of her heart, her body and her mind. She learns that she can't allow herself to be ruled by the her emotions, her sexual desires or her pragmatism alone but instead must live her life by holding all three in a delicate balance.Secondly, this film also marks the maturity of Dominique Swain as an actress. Although Swain was never a child actress in the classic sense of the word, her initial starring role was the remake of the film Lolita. While Lolita was also a mature role, her approach to playing the character was actually somewhat juvenile, as the role demanded in many senses. Here, Swain has shown that she possesses the skills and potential to remain a serious actress for years to come.The story alone makes this film a 4 star picture.

I found this to be a realistic depiction of someone like myself who gets drawn into that whole scene and becomes obsessed over band members.  It doesn't matter what state you live in or what kind of band, groupies always remain the same.  Its this feeling that is so wonderfully captured.  Its a coming of age story for teenage girls.

23058,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,076785344X,Only-A-Child,"[9, 13]","I have probably spent more time on ""Girl"" than it warrants, just consider this a public service to prospective viewers who are unable to make head or tail out of the wide range of comments already posted. As to the quality of its adaptation from the novel, I won't go there because there is no purpose in ""apples to oranges"" comparisons and many others have relentlessly addressed the adaptation issue.Bottom line the movie version of ""Girl"" is a mess-which can be guessed without even viewing. Made-for-cable movies back in 1998 were generally lousy and not the mix of quality that they are in 2005. Neither director Jonathan Kahn nor writer David Tolchinsky had done a feature before ""Girl"" and neither has done anything since 1998. Just do the math.""Girl"" is pretty much what you would have if ""Almost Famous"" had been a long episode of ""My So-Called Life"". Dominique Swain plays the main character (Andrea Marr), basically the Penny Lane character in ""Almost Famous"". Swain's usual acting style is to brazen her way through roles, subtlety and nuance are not words that have ever been used to describe her performances. But in ""Girl"" she comes closest to a carefully crafted performance and actually shows some restraint. Perhaps this is because of her voice-over narration, which serves as a counterpoint to her actions on the screen. She has a nice voice when reined in and she was still very cute in 1998.The most obvious problem when adapting a novel is that the screenplay can include only a fraction of the material. The more characters included in the adaptation, the more shallow the character development. This is one of ""Girl's"" most obvious flaws as there is little reason to connect or care about any of the supporting characters, their quirks exist but we receive no background information so we can never understand why. There is Rebecca (Summer Phoenix) - a big-time grunge music fan who rambles on constantly about music trivia and sex. Rebecca gets the movie's best lines. There is Darcy (Selma Blair) - a walking eating disorder who is supposed to be Andrea's best friend although all they choose to showcase is her resentment of Andrea. There is Cybil (Tara Reid) - A nihilist grunge rocker with a bad home life and a lust for Andrea. Despite Tara Reid being shockingly good in this role (by far her best performance ever) the part is so poorly written and false that it should have omitted from the screenplay. There are Kevin (Channon Roe) & Richard (Christopher Masterson) - class geeks who appear in the school cafeteria as part of Cybil's band and seem to have otherwise been omitted from the screenplay. Finally there is Todd (Sean Patrick Flannery) who is Andrea's main love interest and seems embarrassed about even being associated with this movie-he and Swain have no chemistry and seem genuinely uncomfortable together.Girl's fatal flaw is that it can't decide if it is a comedy, a drama, or a coming-of-age story. Since the humor is confined to an occasional witty line it isn't much of a comedy, the only indication that it was meant to be a comedy is some over-the-top humor about an abusive jock being hit over the head with a board and knocked out. Once is not enough as this nonsense is repeated later in the film. Although not even remotely funny it must be there to let the viewer know that this is a comedy as there are never any consequences to those committing the criminal assault (insert ""Three Stooges"" here). The comedy aspect is finally abandoned and the last few minutes treat us to Lifetime triple feature of teen suicide, bulimia, and homosexuality. These are tacked on with insufficient explanation, apparently because the writer and director sensed that the comedy angle was weak and they needed to qualify it as a coming-of-age story.This genre splitting ultimately undermines the Andrea character who despite Swain's best efforts comes across as a cobbled together mix of inconsistent and conflicting motivations and behaviors-making her impossible to identify with or care about. She is intelligent (headed for an Ivy League school), beautiful, self-assured, adventurous, and has a lot of friends. You have seen this character before in ""Say Anything"" but in ""Girl"" she overnight becomes one of the most hated heroines in teen comedy history. Meaning you have sympathy only for her various victims as she virtually rapes a guy to have her first sex, unfeelingly abandons her friends for cooler ones, explores her emerging femininity without regard to the consequences, and generally acts more eight than eighteen. Swain is physically perfect for the ""Say Anything"" type of heroine but this ultimately works against as her as her transformation into parental nightmare just doesn't ring true.Then again, what do I know?

Swain's character goes from believing that she'll never succumb to the pitfalls of fandom, but falls hard for a rocker portrayed by Flanery. (Who wouldn't?) What unfolds is an endearing coming of age story with many joys and bumps in the road. This was a well acted movie with likeable characters and a plot that many can relate to. The only thing that could have made this film more enjoyable for me would have been to allow Flanery to sing the songs that Todd Sparrow supposedly does (as he sings his own song in ""Raging Angels"").",5,The psychology of being a fan....,965692800,"08 8, 2000",2000,675,"['movie', 'emotions', 'fans', 'go', 'most', 'fans', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'fullfill', 'dreams', 'objects', 'desire', 'Swain', 'character', 'believing', ""'ll"", 'never', 'succumb', 'pitfalls', 'fandom', 'hard', 'rocker', 'portrayed', 'Flanery', 'Who', 'would', ""n't"", 'What', 'endearing', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'many', 'joys', 'bumps', 'road', 'was', 'well', 'acted', 'movie', 'likeable', 'characters', 'plot', 'many', 'can', 'relate', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'allow', 'Flanery', 'sing', 'songs', 'Todd', 'Sparrow', 'supposedly', 'own', 'song', 'Raging', 'Angels']",Girl

23061,A19DW3VKM5KKYB,076785344X,TheBandit,"[9, 14]","Dominique Swain is the primary reason to seek out this relatively little-seen film.  Her first movie role, &quot;Lolita,&quot; is really  something to see.  She is very natural and charismatic.  Unfortunately,  &quot;Girl&quot; isn't up to that standard in any way.  She does what she  can, but the movie is another cliche-ridden teen film.  The supporting cast  makes a great effort, particularly Selma Blair (she must be seen in  &quot;Cruel Intentions,&quot; a wonderful comedic performance).  However,  by the end of this film, I found myself wondering why the main character  Andrea was worthy of my attention for 99 minutes.  She doesn't seem to  change or grow significantly, although clearly that was the intention  (i.e., she becomes a woman, not merely a girl, because she stops chasing  after an immature rock singer).Despite the somewhat poorly told story,  this is a cut above much of the recent teen-flick product.  Besides the  good performances, I give this film some credit for at least attempting to  treat its subject with a degree of seriousness.  As for the DVD, although  not specified here on the amazon.com listing, there is a short 'making-of'  featurette and a commentary track with the director and Dominique Swain.  Fans of Swain take note: she speaks very infrequently during the film.  Still, these features are nice to have and do add to the value of the disc.",3,Three stars-- because I feel like being nice,967766400,"09 1, 2000",2000,1391,"['Dominique', 'Swain', 'primary', 'reason', 'seek', 'out', 'relatively', 'little-seen', 'film', 'first', 'movie', 'role', 'quot', 'Lolita', 'quot', 'really', 'something', 'see', 'very', 'natural', 'charismatic', 'Unfortunately', 'quot', 'Girl', 'quot', ""n't"", 'up', 'standard', 'way', 'what', 'can', 'movie', 'cliche-ridden', 'teen', 'film', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'effort', 'particularly', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'quot', 'Cruel', 'Intentions', 'quot', 'wonderful', 'comedic', 'performance', 'However', 'end', 'film', 'found', 'wondering', 'why', 'main', 'character', 'Andrea', 'was', 'worthy', 'attention', '99', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'seem', 'change', 'grow', 'significantly', 'clearly', 'was', 'intention', 'i.e.', 'woman', 'not', 'merely', 'girl', 'chasing', 'immature', 'rock', 'singer', 'somewhat', 'poorly', 'told', 'story', 'cut', 'much', 'recent', 'teen-flick', 'product', 'good', 'performances', 'give', 'film', 'credit', 'least', 'attempting', 'treat', 'subject', 'degree', 'seriousness', 'DVD', 'not', 'specified', 'here', 'amazon.com', 'listing', 'short', ""'making-of"", 'featurette', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'Dominique', 'Swain', 'Fans', 'Swain', 'take', 'note', 'very', 'infrequently', 'film', 'Still', 'features', 'are', 'nice', 'have', 'do', 'add', 'value', 'disc']",Girl
