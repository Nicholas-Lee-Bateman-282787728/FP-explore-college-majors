Fry ""cgfry""","[1, 1]","This fairly well-made vampire movie has great music (if you like heavy metal) and a mesmerizing supporting part from Ailayah in the titled role; what a very memorable entrance about 50 mins into the movie!But Queen of the Damned fails miserably in its core story.  We discover that vampires (at least some of them) have a heart, and care for the humanity that they have lost.  And apparently the viewer is supposed to feel warm and chummy with the lead couple at the end of the movie.  But along the way, huge numbers of (mostly) female victims die in the clutches of these same vampires (well, by the male half of the couple).  The awfulness of movie comes through in a scene where the lead vampire is disgusted by a beach-full of human victims he and the Queen produced the night before; the statement of the movie is that the continuing deaths of groupies, prostitutes, and other vulnerable humans is forgivable, as long as the complete destruction of humanity doesn't result from the vampires' presence.  We are supposed to, in fact, feel pleased with this outcome.  A sound moral compass is not a requirement for a horror movie of this type.  Even so, an unpleasantly unclean feeling that eventually resolves into disgust is the proper reaction.Not recommended.",2,No moral compass,1155427200,"08 13, 2006",2006,1266,"['fairly', 'well-made', 'vampire', 'movie', 'great', 'music', 'like', 'heavy', 'metal', 'mesmerizing', 'supporting', 'part', 'Ailayah', 'titled', 'role', 'what', 'very', 'memorable', 'entrance', '50', 'mins', 'movie', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'miserably', 'core', 'story', 'discover', 'vampires', 'least', 'have', 'heart', 'care', 'humanity', 'have', 'lost', 'apparently', 'viewer', 'supposed', 'feel', 'warm', 'chummy', 'lead', 'couple', 'end', 'movie', 'way', 'huge', 'numbers', 'mostly', 'female', 'victims', 'die', 'clutches', 'same', 'vampires', 'well', 'male', 'half', 'couple', 'awfulness', 'movie', 'through', 'scene', 'where', 'lead', 'vampire', 'disgusted', 'beach-full', 'human', 'victims', 'Queen', 'produced', 'night', 'statement', 'movie', 'continuing', 'deaths', 'groupies', 'prostitutes', 'other', 'vulnerable', 'humans', 'forgivable', 'as', 'long', 'complete', 'destruction', 'humanity', ""n't"", 'result', 'vampires', 'presence', 'are', 'supposed', 'fact', 'feel', 'pleased', 'outcome', 'sound', 'moral', 'compass', 'not', 'requirement', 'horror', 'movie', 'type', 'Even', 'so', 'unpleasantly', 'unclean', 'feeling', 'eventually', 'disgust', 'proper', 'reaction.Not', 'recommended']",N/A

Well sure i could read the books but, i heard that Interview was faithful to the book in many respects so why shouldn't Queen of the Damned? Faithful to the book or not - reading from other reviews it's not - this movie Sucked . . .pardon the pun.Stuart Townsed really makes for a poor Tom Cruise, i mean Tommy just carried a cool with him in the role which Stuart lacks but makes up for in . . .(?)And i must say, the music in this movie is also exceptionally bad, granted it's meant for goths to listen to, but given the highyly unlikley event of a vamprie claiming superstardom, would ever make him bigger than Elvis, i mean honestly let's give the devil his due. Boring medicore thumping and growling, the only relief we have from this musically is Lestat going crazy on a fiddle, which in my opinion is what he should have whipped out on stage rather than his bandmates.Like i said i didn't read the book, yet, but, from watching Interview you can see the large discrepncies in the scripts. In Interview lestat states ""My Maker taught me nothing."" Where as here we have a reltaionship between maker and made almost trying to mirror the relationship between Lestat and Louis as in Interview, poorly made if i do say so myself. The worst job done by anyone in this film though is given credit to soley Aliyah. I mean she's dead and we're supposed to play nice et all, but come on i've seen better acting from muppets.All in all this movie is bad. Bad,bad,bad,bad, i've seen school productions of My Fair Lady that blow this hunk of **** clear outta the water.Watch Interview, and take comfort in the knowledge that that's about as good as it's gonna get.",1,One star is too much justice for this.,1112227200,"03 31, 2005",2005,1788,"['So', 'other', 'night', 'i', 'finished', 'watching', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'film', 'i', 'love', 'i', ""'m"", 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'Lestat', 'Well', 'sure', 'i', 'could', 'read', 'books', 'i', 'heard', 'Interview', 'was', 'faithful', 'book', 'many', 'respects', 'so', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'Queen', 'Damned', 'Faithful', 'book', 'not', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'not', 'movie', 'Sucked', '.pardon', 'pun.Stuart', 'Townsed', 'really', 'poor', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'i', 'mean', 'Tommy', 'just', 'carried', 'cool', 'role', 'Stuart', 'up', 'i', 'must', 'say', 'music', 'movie', 'also', 'exceptionally', 'bad', 'granted', 'meant', 'goths', 'listen', 'given', 'highyly', 'unlikley', 'event', 'vamprie', 'claiming', 'superstardom', 'would', 'ever', 'make', 'bigger', 'Elvis', 'i', 'mean', 'honestly', 'let', 'give', 'devil', 'due', 'Boring', 'medicore', 'thumping', 'growling', 'only', 'relief', 'have', 'musically', 'Lestat', 'going', 'crazy', 'fiddle', 'opinion', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'whipped', 'out', 'stage', 'rather', 'bandmates.Like', 'i', 'said', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'yet', 'watching', 'Interview', 'can', 'see', 'large', 'discrepncies', 'scripts', 'Interview', 'lestat', 'Maker', 'taught', 'nothing', 'Where', 'here', 'have', 'reltaionship', 'maker', 'made', 'almost', 'trying', 'mirror', 'relationship', 'Lestat', 'Louis', 'Interview', 'poorly', 'made', 'i', 'do', 'say', 'so', 'worst', 'job', 'done', 'anyone', 'film', 'given', 'credit', 'soley', 'Aliyah', 'mean', 'dead', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'play', 'nice', 'et', 'come', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'acting', 'muppets.All', 'movie', 'bad', 'Bad', 'bad', 'bad', 'bad', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'school', 'productions', 'My', 'Fair', 'Lady', 'blow', 'hunk', '****', 'clear', 'water.Watch', 'Interview', 'take', 'comfort', 'knowledge', 'about', 'as', 'good', 'gon', 'get']",N/A

Unfortunatley nothing of this can be said about ""Queen of the Damned"".  Taking not only ONE but TWO of the books from the Vampire Chronicles (The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned- the second and third books respectively)- The movie changes many of the important parts of the book, and even screws up some of the stuff explained in the first movie - like Lestat's creation by Marius- In the book it was done by a Vampire who burned himself to death right after creating Lestat, leaving him to figure everything out on his own, and even in the first movie Lestat explains that he never knew the one who made him. But the story goes on, rushing though the stories. Although it's not the greatest acting job, Aaliyah is the only saving grace of this movie, and sadly it was her last. The only really good scene is when Akasha (Aaliyah) walks into the Admiral's Arms (a club/pub for the living impared, and rips out another vampire's heart and eats it.  The part that dissapointed me the most was that they left out, which in my opinion, was the best part of ""the Queen of the Damned"" which depicts how Vampires came to be. The movie ends with a team effort by a group of Vampires that anyone who didn't read the book would understand who they are.
