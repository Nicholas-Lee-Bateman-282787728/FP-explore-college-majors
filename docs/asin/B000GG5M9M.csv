1003972,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B000GG5M9M,Artist & Author,"[0, 1]","I think this movie had the potential to be an effective portrayal of the AIDS epidemic around the world, but it falls far short.  First, the term AIDS is never mentioned, and unless you knew that some Africans think raping a child virgin would 'cure' the disease, which was depicted in one scene, the disease the people are suffering could have been any number of viral diseases.  Second, while two localities are clear (China & Africa), the 'Western' story confuses the viewer by sometimes speaking German, other times English, and still other times in French.  Also, it is confusing as to if the young man got the disease through gaysex or from acting in porn films.  Third, the depiction of Catholicism is absolutely abominable and deliberately offensive to those of that faith.  I was particularly offended by the senior nun saying they weren't in Africa to bring the people love, but to bring them Jesus.  The Bible clearly states that what one does for 'the least of these' is as if it is done for Jesus.The Chinese story could stand on its own as a full feature movie.  The African story isn't really about the disease but about how much a young nun would prostitute herself to obtain medicines and even cows for a boy's marriage.  The Western story is just a waste of film; it doesn't even include any of the beautiful scenery the other two stories show.I am giving the movie three stars; one for the occasional scenic views, one for the depiction of foreign cultures (although I wonder if Chinese always wear their ceremonial of festival regalia), and the third for raising an interesting ethical or moral issue by the nun's behavior.",3,"Fatally Flawed, But Interesting",1233619200,"02 3, 2009",2009,1643,"['think', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'effective', 'portrayal', 'AIDS', 'epidemic', 'world', 'far', 'short', 'First', 'term', 'AIDS', 'never', 'mentioned', 'knew', 'Africans', 'think', 'raping', 'child', 'virgin', 'would', ""'cure"", 'disease', 'was', 'depicted', 'one', 'scene', 'disease', 'people', 'are', 'suffering', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'number', 'viral', 'diseases', 'Second', 'two', 'localities', 'are', 'clear', 'China', 'Africa', ""'Western"", 'story', 'viewer', 'sometimes', 'speaking', 'German', 'other', 'times', 'English', 'still', 'other', 'times', 'French', 'Also', 'confusing', 'young', 'man', 'got', 'disease', 'gaysex', 'acting', 'porn', 'films', 'Third', 'depiction', 'Catholicism', 'absolutely', 'abominable', 'deliberately', 'offensive', 'faith', 'was', 'particularly', 'offended', 'senior', 'nun', 'saying', 'were', ""n't"", 'Africa', 'bring', 'people', 'love', 'bring', 'Jesus', 'Bible', 'clearly', 'what', 'one', ""'the"", 'least', 'done', 'Jesus.The', 'Chinese', 'story', 'could', 'stand', 'own', 'full', 'feature', 'movie', 'African', 'story', ""n't"", 'really', 'disease', 'how', 'much', 'young', 'nun', 'would', 'prostitute', 'obtain', 'medicines', 'even', 'cows', 'boy', 'marriage', 'Western', 'story', 'just', 'waste', 'film', ""n't"", 'even', 'include', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'other', 'two', 'stories', 'show.I', 'am', 'giving', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'one', 'occasional', 'scenic', 'views', 'one', 'depiction', 'foreign', 'cultures', 'wonder', 'Chinese', 'always', 'wear', 'ceremonial', 'festival', 'regalia', 'third', 'raising', 'interesting', 'ethical', 'moral', 'issue', 'nun', 'behavior']",3 Needles (Region 1 DVD)

But I did not know how hard it would hit. I immediately got online and emailed everyone I knew they HAD to see this movie. I watched without a break - for food, the phone, soda refill, often with mouth open; at the conclusion, I actually felt something a film rarely made me feel. This movie pulled emotion out of me like no other. I don't want to do yet another rehash nor print spoilers, but the acting is superb from all of the players, even those who are in bit parts. Having recently returned from doing volunteer work in Africa (see [...]) the scenes from Africa made me ache to return, but also secured my knowledge there is no changing a culture that has existed since the beginning of time with religion and words (how would we feel if strangers came here and told us churches, the bible, and the crucifix were wrong? Ah!).  Chloe was stunning as always. Stockard and Olympia, who can play anyone and make it look easy, surprised me again. You can have your Britney's and Paris' and Lindsey's, give me style and talent in these women any day.The scenery was gorgeous and the story, as told by Olympia in a voice over, was woven in poetry: ""life and death met on the road"" - but it is not what one expects, and you end up asking yourself, what is sin? A saint? Who are the good guys? The bad? Who is to blame and how do we stop a train? Because these are the questions AIDS has brought us.For more about the work by the Gallmanns, see their site, and also Kuki's books:African Nights: True Stories from the Author of I Dreamed of Africa",5,of villians and heros,1203811200,"02 24, 2008",2008,1684,"['was', 'amazing', 'film', 'accidentally', 'stumbled', 'red', 'box', 'rentals', 'things', 'seeing', 'certain', 'names', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'hard', 'would', 'hit', 'immediately', 'got', 'online', 'emailed', 'everyone', 'knew', 'HAD', 'see', 'movie', 'watched', 'break', 'food', 'phone', 'soda', 'refill', 'often', 'mouth', 'open', 'conclusion', 'actually', 'felt', 'something', 'film', 'rarely', 'made', 'feel', 'movie', 'pulled', 'emotion', 'other', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'yet', 'rehash', 'print', 'spoilers', 'acting', 'superb', 'players', 'even', 'who', 'are', 'bit', 'parts', 'Having', 'recently', 'returned', 'doing', 'volunteer', 'work', 'Africa', 'see', '[', ']', 'scenes', 'Africa', 'made', 'ache', 'return', 'also', 'secured', 'knowledge', 'changing', 'culture', 'existed', 'beginning', 'time', 'religion', 'words', 'how', 'would', 'feel', 'strangers', 'came', 'here', 'told', 'churches', 'bible', 'crucifix', 'were', 'wrong', 'Ah', 'Chloe', 'was', 'stunning', 'always', 'Stockard', 'Olympia', 'who', 'can', 'play', 'anyone', 'make', 'look', 'easy', 'surprised', 'again', 'can', 'have', 'Britney', 'Paris', 'Lindsey', 'give', 'style', 'talent', 'women', 'day.The', 'scenery', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'story', 'told', 'Olympia', 'voice', 'was', 'woven', 'poetry', 'life', 'death', 'met', 'road', 'not', 'what', 'one', 'end', 'up', 'asking', 'what', 'sin', 'saint', 'Who', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'Who', 'blame', 'how', 'do', 'stop', 'train', 'are', 'questions', 'AIDS', 'brought', 'us.For', 'more', 'work', 'Gallmanns', 'see', 'site', 'also', 'Kuki', 'books', 'African', 'Nights', 'True', 'Stories', 'Author', 'Dreamed', 'Africa']",3 Needles (Region 1 DVD)
1003976,A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,B000GG5M9M,Dr. E,"[8, 10]","Thom Fitzgerald has created a haunting, near-perfect work. This piece is divided into three segments:""The Fortitude of the Buddha"":A mere forty-five minutes in length, this is a potent vignette of a rural Chinese village soon ravaged by AIDS. Lucy Liu plays the role of Jin Ping, a blood smuggler. She travels from village to village collecting blood from its impoverished residents. Initially her presence in this small town is a boon. At five dollars a donation, the residents can purchase seed, livestock, and other agricultural necessities. But, this blessing soon turns dark. Perhaps most painful is watching Jin Ping's internal struggle ... she is aware that her practices are infecting innocent, economically challenged people but cannot stop because she is under the brutal control of her dying husband. The first of the three installments concludes on a quai-triumphant note. This segment is clever and educational. It can easily be viewed and understood by a young adult.""The Passion of the Christ"":Set in Canada, this segment addresses the fundamental flaws in the adult entertainment industry. Shawn Ashmore (X-Men) plays Denys, an adult-film actor afflicted with AIDS. Young and living at home with his parents, Denys steals his dying father's blood to pass his mandatory AIDS screenings. This triggers an AIDS crisis within the film industry. Following his father's death, mother and AIDS-stricken son are left broke. The mother (Stockard Channing) purchases a life-insurance policy for herself and then begins seeking-out the virus for herself. The results are horrific to say the very least ... a bizarre expression of a mother's unconditional love (maybe!) The conclusion is the young actor being confronted by one of his victims. She looks him in the eye an utters, """"You killed Me for eight-hundred dollars."" This segment contains strong dialog, adult situations (in strip clubs and on film sets). It is not appropriate for the majority of young people. Nonetheless, it does serve a purpose in showing the viewer the shocking trend of people deliberately seeking the virus.""The Innocence of the Pagans"":An all-star cast! Set in a South African nation, Novice Clara (Chlo Sevigny), Sister Mary (Sandra Oh), and Sister Hilde (Olympia Dukakis) have traveled to Africa to ""save souls from purgatory"" and assist with AIDS afflicted patients. The novice and sisters are appalled to learn that the local men plagued with the AIDS virus believe that having sex with a virgin will rid them of the disease ... and the small children of the area are the victims of this falsehood. Their attempts to bring knowledge and relief to this area are thwarted when the men are jailed for child rape ... with the children ""off-limits,"" other ""vessels of purity"" are sought. The end result is crushing. Adult language and situations may make this unsuitable for less mature young-viewers so use discretion when screening it with young people.Each of these segments can easily stand-alone if you wish to use any one for educational purposes. The weakest of the trio is ""The Passion of the Christ."" While Fitzgerald succeeds in garnering sympathy with ""Buddha"" and ""Pagans"" ... ""Christ"" leaves the viewer repulsed ... and while this approach can be valuable, it strikes a discord with the rest of this fantastic film. Stockard Channing nearly rescues this segment, but it is so repugnant that even her spectacular devotion to role cannot help.Nonetheless, this is film well-worth your attention.

1003977,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000GG5M9M,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","3 NEEDLES as written and directed by Thom Fitzgerald (The Hanging Garden, The Wild Dogs, Blood Moon, Beefcake) is a powerful statement about the insidious spread of AIDS throughout the world, taking us to places we the viewers would rarely visit from the news media emphasis on the disease.  The film is three stories in three countries told in tandem not unlike the technique so successfully used in BABEL, CRASH, and TRAFFIC. Employing cinematography of enormous talent and a cast of terrific actors, Fitzgerald manages to share his stories with such sensitivity that every viewer will feel involved in the tragedy that is rotting away our globe.The film opens with a ceremony in Africa (supposedly South Africa) where young boys undergo ritualistic circumcision, learn the fighting tricks of manhood, and move into society as Men.  This single portion of the film is intensely beautiful in its non-voyeuristic observation of an ages old ritual, so beautiful to watch that it calls for Pause/Replay!  From Africa we go to rural China where Jin Ping (Lucy Liu, speaking Mandarin only) is the very pregnant force who runs an underground blood bank which while serving the donors with some cash also contaminates the population with HIV virus (we discover that Jin Ling is HIV positive, carrying a baby at risk, and supporting her HIV husband). The trials she encounters in her shady business are nothing to the moment of personal anguish when she delivers her baby without assistance in a cornfield.Moving to Canada we meet Denys (Shawn Ashmore), a porn star who is HIV positive but steals blood from his ill father for his frequent 'tests' required by the porn director to hide his positive status in order to continue making porn movies to support his family. His mother Olive (Stockard Channing) discovers his status, hears about AIDS patients' ability to cash in on life insurance early, and infects herself so that she can take advantage of the early insurance cash to provide a life of comfort in the small time they both now have for herself and her now fatherless son.And we return to South Africa where three nuns - Sister Clara (Chlo Sevigny), Sister Hilde Francis (Olympia Dukakis) and  Sister Mary John (Sandra Oh) - set up a clinic to treat the villagers, finding only that acts of tremendous self-sacrifice can stave off the spread of the gore of AIDS. The Men we have watched in the beginning of the film walk into the life that faces a world crippled by HIV and the contrast is powerful.3 NEEDLES' cinematographer Tom Harting deserves awards for the sheer magnificence of his images he captures on film, not only the majestic vistas of Africa and China but also the intimate moments such as Jin Ping's birthing.  The musical score by Christophe Beck and Trevor Morris manages to find the atmosphere of each of the three stations of the cross Fitzgerald examines.  The acting cast, both the gifted well-known actors as well as the smaller roles by unknowns in each location, is magnificent. If the film has a flaw it is in the unfortunate arena of avoiding preaching: watching and hearing the events is so very powerful that words of summation feel superficial and even insulting. But that is a small flaw in a film of wonder.  Highly recommended.

1003981,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000GG5M9M,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[13, 17]","""3 Needles"" is a well-intentioned, serious-minded film from Canadian filmmaker Thom Fitzgerald. While Fitzgerald has a following from his previous efforts ""The Hanging Garden"" and ""Blood Moon,"" this is by far his most ambitious project. He has lined up a first rate roster of talent including Stockard Channing, Lucy Lui, Sandra Oh, Olympia Dukakis, Chloe Sevigny and Shawn Ashmore. Telling three stories revolving around the worldwide AIDS epidemic, ""3 Needles"" was shown on the festival circuit as an interwoven piece (in the style of ""Traffic"" or ""Babel""). However, after middling reviews, it was divided into three separate stories. Released in major cities for Oscar consideration, it was also shown simultaneously as a Showtime premiere.The first segment, set in China, stars Lucy Lui as a pregnant woman trafficking in the black market blood business. In a small rural village, we see the repercussions as HIV contaminated blood affects the supply. The second segment stars Shawn Ashmore as a Canadian porn star. Needing money, he continues to work in the business even after he has been infected with HIV. Stockard Channing plays his mother with a very unorthodox way of providing for them after he has been exposed as a health risk. In the last third, Olympia Dukakis, Chloe Sevigny, and Sandra Oh play missionaries on assignment to help a hospital in Africa. They struggle to educate the local workers in facts, not superstitions, to help prevent the spread of the virus.I admire the scope and the intent behind ""3 Needles"" very much. Obviously made as a ""serious"" film, I never think it's bad to use the film medium to educate on important matters. However, I felt ""3 Needles"" always kept me at arm's distance. For a film filled with such tragedy, such horrors--there was something of an emotional disconnect. I did find the stories interesting enough, but sadly--they never moved me. Part of the problem had to be the characters, they were limited in development. I was intrigued by what they were doing (because they make some controversial choices), but we're never allowed to understand the ""why."" With a little more depth, any one of these stories could have been a far more effective feature film. But, as is, the segments are a bit distant and the characters cryptic.It doesn't help matters, however, that each sequence ends with a very obvious message. I had admired, at least, that each tale wasn't overtly ""preachy""--but then as each came to a conclusion, so came the heavy-handed lesson (often delivered in an unnecessary voice-over by Dukakis). It's almost as if the film didn't trust you to make the necessary conclusion for yourself. There's no doubt that Fitzgerald is a talent, ""3 Needles"" is a grand stretch for him.

However, this movie failed to connect with the viewers...well, at least, with me.  I think it had to do with the 3 stories being too short for character development and allowing us to connect with these people.The first story deals with a pregnant Chinese (Liu) who shells out $5 dollars per donation.  However, she turns around and sells blood illegally.  She's doing this all at the command of her husband, who is dying of AIDS.The second story focuses on a gay Canadian porn actor.  He cheats the mandatory blood tests by using his dying father's blood.  When the father dies, the mother discovers her son's sero-status.  Upon discovery, she does something unpredictable that will grab your attention until the end.  This is perhaps the best story of the three.The last story is about 3 nuns who come to South Africa to care for the afflicted as well to save their souls.  Somehow, the afflicted locals are led to believe that to rid of their disease, they must have sex with a virgin.  In here, the virgins are the children.  Enraged, the nuns have asked a local and powerful white man to put a stop to this horrible practice.  He does but it comes with a price.The problem with these stories is that their climax/peak is weak.  Each of their conclusion are even weaker.  It feels like it stopped abruptly.

The cinematography is beautiful, the acting is great, the writing is thoughtful.  I was surprised to find so many negative ratings for this film.  Maybe it's because ""3 Needles"" breaks the mold of so many Hollywood films, but that's part of its appeal for me.  What is ""boring"" for one, is contemplative and authentic for another.The multicultural orientation of this film is another plus in my book, it utilizes five languages (maybe some people don't like reading subtitles).""3 Needles"" also sheds light on issues of sexism, AIDS, exploitation, etc., while also shedding light on how resilient and kind people can be.There's a scene with a pornstar helping his sick father bathe.  Routine moments of elder care like that, which are usually hidden away in our ""old folks"" homes, will disturb some viewers who fear their own ageing process.  I found it to be a touching moment, and like so many scenes of this film, it was captured with great skill.This film, and many others, are being shown as part of World AIDS Day.  ""Link TV"" and ""Sundance"" have also been airing programs related to this disease.  AIDS is something of a mysteryThe River : A Journey to the Source of HIV and AIDS, but there's no doubt that it is having a devastating effect, particularly in Africa.

The best story was the intial full story ripped from the headlines about AIDS being passed onto innocent Chinese rural citizens.  What I was surprised at was that they do not touch on the cover up.After an initial sad, but very truthful story the movie goes quickly downhill from there.  The second story is an idiotic and selfish story, that puts in a twist, but doesn't pay off and only is weird.  I felt no sympathy for any of the characters in that second story.The third story show's the writer and director's total misunderstanding of Catholic theology, nuns, and their views.  Then essentially makes a saint out of a Nun who pimps herself out to a rich western business man for the sake of the dying AID's children to make her out as some saint.  It ends up being a sad and idiotic moral to a very real crisis in Africa.This story is not like Babel other than being a losely connected story in various countries.  Babel shockingly showed human connection through pain, but this story instead shows nothing of the sort.

During their stay, they come across chaotic and dangerous situations. Chloe Sevigney is more striking and she has more screentime. Sandra Oh also has a few strong moments to work with. The rape scene was a bit too much to digest.Stockard Channing plays a self-sacrificing and unconditional loving mother whose husband dies and finds out that her son is porn star and contracted the virus. She plots a life-insurance scheme and uses her son's blood to contract the virus. Canadian actor Shawn Ashmore(known for his X-Men role) gets to deliver one of the most memorable performances of the year. I must say that Channing's performance is totally ""tearjerking""!Finally, Lucy Lui was mesmerizing in her first exclusive Mandarin speaking role. She plays a blood collector and she's heavily pregnant. Her husband is dying and she's not healthy and the baby in her stomach is at risk. Her biggest moment was when she had to give birth by herself in a corn field. This role is nothing like her other American movie roles.
