Sean and Peter continuously butt heads with each other over Emma, which leads them to an illegal street race that ends badly.  Sean and Emma do end up getting back together, but Sean's image of Emma being perfect is shattered when he finds out a secret about her and Jay (think back to season 4).  A new girl name Mia Jones, a former Lakehurst student, becomes a student at Degrassi, and is at first snubbed by Darcy (the new Squad captain) when she tries to get on the cheerleading squad simply because she has a kid, which is how she ends up hooking up with J.T. Yorke.  Liberty, J.T.'s ex-girlfriend, is jealous and bitter about J.T. moving on, especially since she still has feelings for him, and is still dealing with things from the previous year. J.T. has a rivalry with some Lakehurst thugs. Darcy finds herself being stalked by an online predator. Paige, starting her first year at University, finally starts to crack under the pressure and has panic attacks. Craig returns, and brings his drug problem along with him, which leads to the end of his relationship with Manny.  Ellie Nash, who is in college and dating the editor of the newspaper, falls for Craig once again, and his hurt by Craig once again, due to his addiction.  Manny, determined to make herself feel better after her break-up with Craig, decides to throw a birthday party for Liberty at Emma's place when her parents go out of town.  The party is soon out of control, and once some uninvited guests arrive, the party takes a tragic turn and we see the loss of one of Degrassi's beloved characters.Definitely another good, intense season, which will definitely (in my opinion) require some tissues after the death of one of the main characters",5,"Season 6 is good, but be prepared to say goodbye to a beloved character!",1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,1913,"['Sean', 'Cameron', 'Emma', 'Nelson', 'first', 'love', 'returns', 'shaking', 'foundation', 'seemingly', 'solid', 'relationship', 'Peter', 'Stone', 'who', 'stuck', 'eating', 'disorder', 'battle', 'season', '5', 'Sean', 'Peter', 'continuously', 'heads', 'other', 'Emma', 'illegal', 'street', 'race', 'badly', 'Sean', 'Emma', 'do', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'back', 'together', 'Sean', 'image', 'Emma', 'being', 'perfect', 'shattered', 'when', 'out', 'secret', 'Jay', 'think', 'back', 'season', '4', 'new', 'girl', 'name', 'Mia', 'Jones', 'former', 'Lakehurst', 'student', 'student', 'Degrassi', 'first', 'snubbed', 'Darcy', 'new', 'Squad', 'captain', 'when', 'get', 'cheerleading', 'squad', 'simply', 'kid', 'how', 'up', 'hooking', 'up', 'J.T', 'Yorke', 'Liberty', 'J.T', 'ex-girlfriend', 'jealous', 'bitter', 'J.T', 'moving', 'especially', 'still', 'feelings', 'still', 'dealing', 'things', 'previous', 'year', 'J.T', 'rivalry', 'Lakehurst', 'thugs', 'Darcy', 'being', 'stalked', 'online', 'predator', 'Paige', 'starting', 'first', 'year', 'University', 'finally', 'crack', 'pressure', 'panic', 'attacks', 'Craig', 'returns', 'drug', 'problem', 'end', 'relationship', 'Manny', 'Ellie', 'Nash', 'who', 'college', 'dating', 'editor', 'newspaper', 'Craig', 'once', 'again', 'hurt', 'Craig', 'once', 'again', 'due', 'addiction', 'Manny', 'determined', 'make', 'feel', 'better', 'break-up', 'Craig', 'throw', 'birthday', 'party', 'Liberty', 'Emma', 'place', 'when', 'parents', 'go', 'town', 'party', 'soon', 'control', 'once', 'uninvited', 'guests', 'arrive', 'party', 'tragic', 'turn', 'see', 'loss', 'one', 'Degrassi', 'beloved', 'characters.Definitely', 'good', 'intense', 'season', 'will', 'definitely', 'opinion', 'require', 'tissues', 'death', 'one', 'main', 'characters']","Degrassi: The Next Generation, Season 6"

1140083,A233UR4B7OT4RR,B0012Z5UMA,ROFLChopper,"[1, 2]","Season 6 kicks off with the return of Sean Cameron.  The last viewers saw this character was back in mid-season 4 in Back in Black.  In the season opener, he and his ex Emma Nelson begin to rekindle their high school romance; but there is a problem, Peter Stone is determined to keep these two apart in the first 3 episodes.Degrassi also gets new rivals and newbies in Mia (played by Nina Dorbev) and Johnny.  Both characters later become heavily linked later in the season when Degrassi looses one of its beloved characters.Meanwhile, Jimmy and Spinner restore their friendship after a couple of seasons due to the school shooting that paralyzed Jimmy.  Spinner and Darcy are back together, but not for long.  Jimmy and Ashley are together, while Jimmy is aimed to satisfy Ashley more than just on a emotional level.  Alex also returns back to Degrassi for a fast-track to improve her grades to get into college. Later in the season, Alex has to set her pride to the side to make quick cash when things go terribly wrong at home.The graduates, who actually went to college, start embarking on their new journey post-Degrassi but not without its share of problems.  Ellie is a freshman reporter of her college paper which leads to her developing a relationship with head-editor Jesse.  Ellie though can't seem to get over Craig, who also is dealing more than with his fair share of bad habits.  Marco becomes warily that his boyfriend Dylan could be cheating and Marco becomes addicted to a new activity which could have him losing more than just fair share of winnings.  Paige returns midway in the season facing the possibilities she has failed at her dream college.  Paige and Alex take on their relationship for the second time, where there seems to be more angst and heartache from the last break-up.  Can these two make it through the storm or will the pain be much too serve to restore?All in all I found this season to be decent.  Season 6 didn't leave up to any huge expectations like previous seasons.  The show didn't pick up for me until Rock this Town and the graduates got most of the story towards the end of the season.  Yet this is only my opinion, if you are a Degrassi buff, I would recommend you purchasing this season to add to your collection.",3,Respectable season,1289174400,"11 8, 2010",2010,2265,"['Season', '6', 'kicks', 'return', 'Sean', 'Cameron', 'last', 'viewers', 'saw', 'character', 'was', 'back', 'mid-season', '4', 'Back', 'Black', 'season', 'opener', 'ex', 'Emma', 'Nelson', 'begin', 'rekindle', 'high', 'school', 'romance', 'problem', 'Peter', 'Stone', 'determined', 'keep', 'two', 'apart', 'first', '3', 'episodes.Degrassi', 'also', 'new', 'rivals', 'newbies', 'Mia', 'played', 'Nina', 'Dorbev', 'Johnny', 'characters', 'later', 'become', 'heavily', 'linked', 'later', 'season', 'when', 'Degrassi', 'one', 'beloved', 'characters.Meanwhile', 'Jimmy', 'Spinner', 'restore', 'friendship', 'couple', 'seasons', 'due', 'school', 'shooting', 'paralyzed', 'Jimmy', 'Spinner', 'Darcy', 'are', 'back', 'together', 'not', 'long', 'Jimmy', 'Ashley', 'are', 'together', 'Jimmy', 'aimed', 'satisfy', 'Ashley', 'more', 'just', 'emotional', 'level', 'Alex', 'also', 'back', 'Degrassi', 'fast-track', 'improve', 'grades', 'get', 'college', 'Later', 'season', 'Alex', 'set', 'pride', 'side', 'make', 'quick', 'cash', 'when', 'things', 'go', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'home.The', 'graduates', 'who', 'actually', 'went', 'college', 'start', 'embarking', 'new', 'journey', 'post-Degrassi', 'not', 'share', 'problems', 'Ellie', 'freshman', 'reporter', 'college', 'paper', 'developing', 'relationship', 'head-editor', 'Jesse', 'Ellie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'Craig', 'who', 'also', 'dealing', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'bad', 'habits', 'Marco', 'warily', 'boyfriend', 'Dylan', 'could', 'be', 'cheating', 'Marco', 'becomes', 'addicted', 'new', 'activity', 'could', 'have', 'losing', 'more', 'just', 'fair', 'share', 'winnings', 'Paige', 'midway', 'season', 'facing', 'possibilities', 'failed', 'dream', 'college', 'Paige', 'Alex', 'take', 'relationship', 'second', 'time', 'where', 'there', 'be', 'more', 'angst', 'heartache', 'last', 'break-up', 'Can', 'two', 'make', 'storm', 'will', 'pain', 'be', 'much', 'too', 'serve', 'restore', 'found', 'season', 'be', 'decent', 'Season', '6', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'up', 'huge', 'expectations', 'previous', 'seasons', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'Rock', 'Town', 'graduates', 'got', 'most', 'story', 'end', 'season', 'only', 'opinion', 'are', 'Degrassi', 'buff', 'would', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'season', 'add', 'collection']","Degrassi: The Next Generation, Season 6"
1140084,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B0012Z5UMA,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[2, 3]","Cons: I really wish the TV writers for this show would actually spend some time around thugs. Every time Jay talks, I cringe. What thug says, ""Yo gangstas, what's the haps?"" That's the type of line that gets people beat up, not makes you think of someone who does the beating up. But every blue moon, he'll have a moment. All of his scenes with J.T. were believable. He seemed more awkward hanging around people who weren't his regular ""in"" crowd. All of Disc 3 was boring. I am just not into the Paige show. I'm bored with her on-again-off-again lesbian relationship. Her character's role has been done entirely too many times--spoiled, materialistic, melodramatic, sneaky and confused. I used to think her girlfriend was interesting and the bail scene actually threw me off, but other than that, the girlfriend seems to be slowly morphing into another Hazel, a character buried in Paige's life. There is definitely more of a background for her, but the problem is I don't believe it. The stripping was too predictable, and all the crying and falling apart was about as annoying as Paige's personality. Why didn't that girl go to college and fall back from the show? I'm still scratching my head about why Ashley returned to the show other than to be another technical girlfriend for Jimmy. Also, why does it seem like Jimmy became really boring after he got in this wheelchair? How do you make such an interesting character so drab so quickly? The episode about his physical challenge was interesting initially, but soon after the results were made, he went back to falling in the background again. I also immediately lost interest in the Christian girl and the principal's son.Pros: This isn't really a pro, but I loved all of the stories revolving around Liberty and J.T., for two reasons: 1) They're cute as hell together. 2) The way that relationship worked out actually made me cry. I kinda don't like putting this in the ""pros"" section because I wish it would've been done differently, but I actually appreciated the show for throwing me off. I NEVER saw that situation turning out like it did, and that's what makes me keep tuning in to the show. I watched those two episodes, specifically the birthday party one, several times. Same for Craig! Craig was already a little ""off"" to begin with, but when he returned to the show, I loved those episodes. He was another one who I didn't expect to be how he is, and I liked watching his love triangle with Manny and Ellie. Although Jimmy's character is starting to get ignored and seems one dimensional, which is odd because in the other seasons I really enjoyed him, the idea of the T-shirt business was cool. I think the show is getting rid of (or they're leaving) some great characters and highlighting the ones with personalities we've seen over and over again. I am glad they brought Shawn (and his biceps) back though. He's still doing that same pouty-mouthed face that Paige does (he loses thug credibility with that, by the way), but I like him. He's interesting, and I'm never quite sure what he's going to get into.Favorite characters from this season (in this order): 1) Craig, 2) Spinner (I LOVE Spinner! The man said ""Switzer Mister."" He's always saying the wrong thing, but he manages to be charming anyway.) 3) Liberty, 4) J.T., 5) Shawn",3,"Up, then down, up, then down",1303430400,"04 22, 2011",2011,3306,"['Cons', 'really', 'wish', 'TV', 'writers', 'show', 'would', 'actually', 'spend', 'time', 'around', 'thugs', 'time', 'Jay', 'talks', 'cringe', 'What', 'thug', 'Yo', 'gangstas', 'what', 'haps', 'type', 'line', 'people', 'beat', 'up', 'not', 'think', 'someone', 'who', 'beating', 'up', 'blue', 'moon', ""'ll"", 'have', 'moment', 'scenes', 'J.T', 'were', 'believable', 'seemed', 'more', 'awkward', 'hanging', 'around', 'people', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'regular', 'crowd', 'Disc', '3', 'was', 'boring', 'am', 'just', 'not', 'Paige', 'show', ""'m"", 'bored', 'on-again-off-again', 'lesbian', 'relationship', 'character', 'role', 'been', 'done', 'entirely', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'spoiled', 'materialistic', 'melodramatic', 'sneaky', 'confused', 'used', 'think', 'girlfriend', 'was', 'interesting', 'bail', 'scene', 'actually', 'threw', 'off', 'other', 'girlfriend', 'be', 'slowly', 'morphing', 'Hazel', 'character', 'buried', 'Paige', 'life', 'definitely', 'more', 'background', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'stripping', 'was', 'too', 'predictable', 'crying', 'falling', 'apart', 'was', 'as', 'annoying', 'Paige', 'personality', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'girl', 'go', 'college', 'fall', 'back', 'show', ""'m"", 'still', 'scratching', 'head', 'why', 'Ashley', 'returned', 'show', 'other', 'be', 'technical', 'girlfriend', 'Jimmy', 'Also', 'why', 'seem', 'Jimmy', 'became', 'really', 'boring', 'got', 'wheelchair', 'How', 'do', 'make', 'such', 'interesting', 'character', 'so', 'drab', 'so', 'quickly', 'episode', 'physical', 'challenge', 'was', 'interesting', 'initially', 'soon', 'results', 'were', 'made', 'went', 'back', 'falling', 'background', 'again', 'also', 'immediately', 'lost', 'interest', 'Christian', 'girl', 'principal', 'son.Pros', ""n't"", 'really', 'pro', 'loved', 'stories', 'revolving', 'Liberty', 'J.T.', 'two', 'reasons', '1', ""'re"", 'cute', 'hell', 'together', '2', 'way', 'relationship', 'worked', 'out', 'actually', 'made', 'cry', 'kinda', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'putting', 'pros', 'section', 'wish', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done', 'differently', 'actually', 'appreciated', 'show', 'throwing', 'NEVER', 'saw', 'situation', 'turning', 'out', 'did', 'what', 'keep', 'tuning', 'show', 'watched', 'two', 'episodes', 'specifically', 'birthday', 'party', 'one', 'several', 'times', 'Same', 'Craig', 'Craig', 'was', 'already', 'little', 'off', 'begin', 'when', 'returned', 'show', 'loved', 'episodes', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'how', 'liked', 'watching', 'love', 'triangle', 'Manny', 'Ellie', 'Jimmy', 'character', 'starting', 'get', 'ignored', 'one', 'dimensional', 'odd', 'other', 'seasons', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'idea', 'T-shirt', 'business', 'was', 'cool', 'think', 'show', 'getting', 'rid', ""'re"", 'leaving', 'great', 'characters', 'highlighting', 'ones', 'personalities', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'over', 'again', 'am', 'glad', 'brought', 'Shawn', 'biceps', 'back', 'still', 'doing', 'same', 'pouty-mouthed', 'face', 'Paige', 'thug', 'credibility', 'way', 'like', 'interesting', ""'m"", 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'going', 'get', 'into.Favorite', 'characters', 'season', 'order', '1', 'Craig', '2', 'Spinner', 'LOVE', 'Spinner', 'man', 'said', 'Switzer', 'Mister', 'always', 'saying', 'wrong', 'thing', 'be', 'charming', 'anyway', '3', 'Liberty', '4', 'J.T.', '5', 'Shawn']","Degrassi: The Next Generation, Season 6"
