1161048,A1GZB9BEV1LCX2,B0018TN734,"Beverly M. Carl ""Beverly Carl""","[18, 20]","Amazing 5 month tour of 34 nations.  Having worked or traveled in most these countries, I was much impressed by Cruickshank's ability to capture the essence of these diverse cultures as manifested in their art and architecture.  His comments were intelligent.  One might quibble over some of the details, but all in all it's a stunning achievement. I really appreciated his covering lesser known spots like Mali and Ethiopia.  Of course, I have my own photos, but they cannot compare with the beauty captured by these professional cameramen.  What a marvelous addition to my own memoirs!",5,Wonderful tour of global art.,1221004800,"09 10, 2008",2008,587,"['Amazing', '5', 'month', 'tour', '34', 'nations', 'Having', 'worked', 'traveled', 'most', 'countries', 'was', 'much', 'impressed', 'Cruickshank', 'ability', 'capture', 'essence', 'diverse', 'cultures', 'manifested', 'art', 'architecture', 'comments', 'were', 'intelligent', 'One', 'might', 'quibble', 'details', 'stunning', 'achievement', 'really', 'appreciated', 'covering', 'lesser', 'known', 'spots', 'Mali', 'Ethiopia', 'course', 'have', 'own', 'photos', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'beauty', 'captured', 'professional', 'cameramen', 'What', 'marvelous', 'addition', 'own', 'memoirs']",N/A

Most were frankly disappointing or extremely bloody like the Aztecs. His choices concerning Pre Columbian America were frankly not the best. I was also disappointed in his coverage of America (A Pistol and New York City!?! Are to be considered treasures?) I could pick a few places like Alaska or the Grand Tetons that are more of a treasure.All in all a big disappointment.,1,Save your Time & Money,1282694400,"08 25, 2010",2010,475,"['was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'sites', 'picked', 'were', 'interesting', 'Incas', 'Most', 'were', 'frankly', 'disappointing', 'extremely', 'bloody', 'Aztecs', 'choices', 'concerning', 'Pre', 'Columbian', 'America', 'were', 'frankly', 'not', 'best', 'was', 'also', 'disappointed', 'coverage', 'America', 'A', 'Pistol', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Are', 'be', 'considered', 'treasures', 'could', 'pick', 'few', 'places', 'Alaska', 'Grand', 'Tetons', 'are', 'more', 'treasure.All', 'big', 'disappointment']",N/A

Other than the fact that Mr. C. touches everything no matter how old they are this was a most enlightening DVD and SO worth watching.  We couldn't afford a vacation this year so we watched one episode per day during my husband's week off work and pretended Mr. C. took us with him.  He includes you in the conversation and his choices and the thought behind the choices is wonderful.  Your life will be enriched by these two DVD's that have episodes front and back.

So far he has expressed his sorrow at the defeat of Communisim in front of a mural painted in Mexico. He is saddened by the victory of ""Evil Capitalism"" he neglects to mention the clearly visible swastika in the workers' paradise. This was probably due to the Nazi-Stalin pack signed near the time of completion of the art work. Later he tanks about the Mesa Verde culture's oneness with their environment, which from evidence did not include a friendly relationship with their neighbores, since there is little reason to build your homes in a cave half way up a cliff, reachable only by shallow hand holds cut into the rock and even after that building doors so small that they can be easily defended in case of attack. He also talk about how the indigenous peoples of the Americas lived in harmony with nature, failing to even mention the many times that cultures collapsed in the New World prior to European contact because they overran the carrying capacity of their environments. The narration also mentions but makes no peedantic moral judgement about Inca conquest of other indigenous cultures, and completely glosses over the brutal nature of the Aztec Empire.I haven't gotten past this part yet.
