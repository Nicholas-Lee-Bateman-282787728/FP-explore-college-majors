I was about to get this movie until saw that they got a lot more songs just like Tyler Perry stage play. I can't handle it. It would be better off if they don't have all those songs. I am not trying sound rude, but it honest upon how this movie went (it actually is stage play) Yes, you can do anything thru Christ, that is what mentioned in movie. I love the movie's ending espically. I cried all the time seeing movie, it talks about how mother want children be home and she ask God she would do snything even if it mean her...then she got cancer. But later She is walking and better! I got up and dancing crying! I know the Lord can do it all!
