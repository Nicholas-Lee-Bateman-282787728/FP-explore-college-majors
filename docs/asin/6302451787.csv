The film is indeed very original and has good acting and production values.  But the dog who is the central character is more a metaphor for the depraved depths of the human psyche; certainly the traits attributed to it have nothing to do with dogs and everything to do with human sociopathic behavior and mental illness.  And yet viewers will have great difficulty not empathizing with it as a dog.  WARNING - SPOILER AHEAD: I had a knot in my stomach from the first seconds of the film through the violent and disturbing denouement in which the boy abuses and kills the dog, yet kept watching in the absurd hope that somehow the filmmaker would find a way to redeem the story.  The ending was very unsatisfactory: the boy lies about the incident and goes back to his suburban existence.  Not only is this just too depraved for my tastes, but it makes no sense in terms of the boy's persona, which is totally obsessed with Hitler's final days and suicide.",1,Too dark for me,1206662400,"03 28, 2008",2008,1045,"['struggled', 'could', 'good', 'conscience', 'recommend', 'film', 'reason', 'film', 'indeed', 'very', 'original', 'good', 'acting', 'production', 'values', 'dog', 'who', 'central', 'character', 'more', 'metaphor', 'depraved', 'depths', 'human', 'psyche', 'certainly', 'traits', 'attributed', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'dogs', 'everything', 'do', 'human', 'sociopathic', 'behavior', 'mental', 'illness', 'yet', 'viewers', 'will', 'have', 'great', 'difficulty', 'not', 'empathizing', 'dog', 'WARNING', 'SPOILER', 'had', 'knot', 'stomach', 'first', 'seconds', 'film', 'violent', 'disturbing', 'denouement', 'boy', 'abuses', 'dog', 'yet', 'kept', 'watching', 'absurd', 'hope', 'filmmaker', 'would', 'find', 'way', 'redeem', 'story', 'ending', 'was', 'very', 'unsatisfactory', 'boy', 'incident', 'back', 'suburban', 'existence', 'Not', 'only', 'just', 'too', 'depraved', 'tastes', 'sense', 'terms', 'boy', 'persona', 'totally', 'obsessed', 'Hitler', 'final', 'days', 'suicide']",Baxter VHS

But I am going to tell you that its NOT a movie to see with the grandchildren. This is a french film that is very original. A little slow at first but it gets a lot better along the way. If you are not an open minded individual dont see it. There are some things that are a little disturbing if taken out of context (especially if you are an overly fretful parent). I strongly disagree with the reviewer who alludes to there being ""two of the most cold blooded scenes"" he/she's ever seen. Give me a break, just look at what is and has been coming out of hollywood, nothing but sex and violence (no sex in Baxter by the way).

313128,A246DH8PG0PW10,6302451787,Knowledge Contagion,"[4, 4]","What caught my attention was the pit bull on the cover. When I read that the movie was about a bull terrier I was rather miffed because I love pit bulls and think that whoever designed this cover used their bad reputation to try to market this movie (oddly enough even though a pit bull's on the cover, a bull terrior is on the spine [or whatever it's called]). That bias aside ... I'm pretty sure that Baxter isn't sociopathic ... it's my understanding that sociopaths don't catagorize their thoughts as ""unnatural"" (a word Baxter uses multiple times when relaying his violent or unhappy thoughts). I picked up the movie thinking I'd be in for a unique take on animal horror (think ""Man's Best Friend"" minus all of the animal experimentation and add a big splash of realism) - the picture on the back of Baxter watching the baby crawl towards the water was chilling and I was looking forward to seeing a movie about a trully evil dog. What I got instead was more social commentary than anything - whether that was the film maker's intent or not.That disappointment aside, I really enjoyed this film (with the exception of the graphic scenes where Baxter is being abused by that Hilter-in-training creep). I found myself sympathising with him almost right from the beginning and rooting for him to find someone who would make him happy and give him the life he deserved. A lot of the other reviewers already summed up the movie and brought up some spoilers so I won't rehash it all. Suffice to say that even though this movie was pretty misrepresented, it was thought provoking. I'm very glad I decided to buy it.

Obviously, , the dog you see in the photo of the cover is an American Pit Bull Terrier -- or, possibly, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier -- looking appropriately vicious. Well, the dog in the film is a Bull Terrier, which is a slightly smaller but no less muscular breed; also a popular fighting dog at one time. Secondly, this is more of a dark comedy or an artful, succinct, and wry drama. The film is narrated as if we are hearing the sophisticated, calculating thoughts of a canine absolutely desperate for a fulfilling role to play in the lives of humans. Although there is death in the picture, no scene depicts any sort of brutal dog attack -- as Baxter is as clever as any human, and stronger, and is looking for peaceable fulfilment, not disdain and violence. This is not a horror film -- it's not even a thriller, really. Baxter is , quite frankly, the most interesting character in the film, but fair warning- the ending is both anti climatic and un realistic.

313130,A1ARHZTPIWG49I,6302451787,"Sara Watson ""Ms. Konstrue""","[9, 10]","This movie is not for the faint of heart or for those easily upset.  It's an imaginative and well-made movie, full of uncomfortable pathos.  Baxter is an intelligent and sensitive bull terrier who longs to find the right master.  His narration is brilliant in dark, slightly sultry French--the man's voice is perfect.  It's a very human depiction.  For example, Baxter eroticizes the young woman who is his owner for a short time, then kills out of his jealousy for her affection.  I found myself moved and disturbed by his desires, and also enthralled with the brutality.  It's a mean little movie and with violence against children and animals (I don't believe that much of it is shown--but it's still upsetting), as well as Nazi references that may out-and-out offend people.  As a litmus test, if you saw the film Parents (a great, but dark psychological thriller and comedy) or Curdled, then I think you might appreciate Baxter.  If you're wondering where the comedy in the film is, then I would have to say it's in the deadpan narration juxtaposed with the scenes.  It's not ha-ha comedy, but chilling and ultra dark.Some of the reviewers were upset by the brutality or the depiction of the dog as evil, and my take was different.  I didn't think of Baxter as evil, so much as passionate and misled by his desire to serve the right master (some good commentary on Nazi Germany).  Overall, I don't think the director's intent was to glorify the violence or meanness, but to make us think of the ways in which we inadvertently create monsters and to make those monsters, be it a lonely and cruel boy or a dog with human desires, sympathetic.  I feel terrible for anyone who accidentally rented this as a family movie.  This is an artsy film geared at adults who aren't put off by pervosity, think Gods and Monsters or Apt Pupil. A tough movie, but thought provoking.",4,"Great movie, but horrifying and at moments darkly (uber-darkly) comical.
