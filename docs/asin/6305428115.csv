Every dished-out fact spoken throughout the movie is a dead on biography in itself of government surveilance and national security. Gene Hackman portrays the perfect, grumpy ex-security agent who is trying to build his life around his days as a protector of America. Until however, he runs into labor lawyer Robert Dean played by Will Smith, who is suddenly caught up in a web of false accusations and conspiracy from the country's last line of defense. He and Hackman must now work together to save his life...and his good name, which is cleverly tarnished by the agency and a crooked politician. The casting really brings out the best in the movie, especially with Will Smith's sarcastic and rather indifferent and comic attitude at times. The high-tech gadget war keeps you interested as you wonder whose technology will prevail in the end. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat with non-stop action, flawless scripting and above all it's similarity to a highly advanced and often paranoid world we live in today.",5,An Eye-Opener To a Frightening New World.,984528000,"03 14, 2001",2001,1196,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'quot', 'Enemy', 'State', 'quot', 'immediately', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'many', 'films', 'awaken', 'people', 'harsh', 'reality', 'privacy', 'era', 'dished-out', 'fact', 'spoken', 'movie', 'dead', 'biography', 'government', 'surveilance', 'national', 'security', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'perfect', 'grumpy', 'ex-security', 'agent', 'who', 'trying', 'build', 'life', 'days', 'protector', 'America', 'however', 'labor', 'lawyer', 'Robert', 'Dean', 'played', 'Will', 'Smith', 'who', 'suddenly', 'caught', 'up', 'web', 'false', 'accusations', 'conspiracy', 'country', 'last', 'line', 'defense', 'Hackman', 'must', 'now', 'work', 'together', 'save', 'life', 'good', 'name', 'cleverly', 'tarnished', 'agency', 'crooked', 'politician', 'casting', 'really', 'out', 'best', 'movie', 'especially', 'Will', 'Smith', 'sarcastic', 'rather', 'indifferent', 'comic', 'attitude', 'times', 'high-tech', 'gadget', 'war', 'interested', 'wonder', 'technology', 'will', 'prevail', 'end', 'movie', 'edge', 'seat', 'non-stop', 'action', 'flawless', 'scripting', 'similarity', 'highly', 'advanced', 'often', 'paranoid', 'world', 'live', 'today']",Enemy Of The State

It is incredibly well-constructed for what it is: slick, well-shot, gloriously pacey and even with a dash of interesting social question in there. Granted, often it is incredibly implausible, and his ability to sit back and be happy at the end despite all the carnage of what has happened, make it a little laughable, but the fact is, thats not the point with this kind of film - the point is it is truly thrilling, stylish and cool. You really get deep into it.Will Smith is startlingly good in his best performance since Six Degrees Of Seperation - if only he would turn in these great performances in credible, interesting films more often, and is well supported by a strong cast that includes Gene Hackman, Jamie Kennedy and Jack Black amongst others.

463980,A1GB0HW46Y2EB,6305428115,Bruce G. Taylor,"[0, 0]","""Enemy of the State"" is an entertaining, fast-paced movie with high production values and  a fine cast.  There are times, though, when the story telegraphs its punches.NOTE: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.In the first scene, during which a senator portrayed by the late Jason Robards gets into a  squabble with a gang of surveillance (NSA) men, we know he isn't going to come out of this scene alive.  As it turns out, the murder of the senator occurring near a lake has been photographed by an ""environmental"" camera.  A young technician later removes the film cartridge and sees what has been photographed.  The gang finds out about it and is after him.  While he is trying to elude them he comes across Will Smith, an attorney whom he previously knew.  He slips the film into Will Smith's shopping bag and takes off.  At that instant I said, ""This guy will be dead within two minutes of screen time.""  Sure, enough.  Later when Smith goes to the apartment of a woman who may have some important information, we see him approaching her apartment door.  At that point  I said, ""We know what he is going to find in there, don't we?""  Sure enough -- another stiff.We don't see much of Gene Hackman for the first hour and twenty minutes of the movie and as fine as Will Smith's performance is, Hackman's portrayal of a surveillance expert from the old days really brightens up the picture with his great screen presence and good humor.  Smith and Hackman fall in together and, as it turns out out, Hackman is  better at the surveillance game than the NSA guys are. Jon Voight is excellent as the lead NSA heavy.  After several chases and a few explosions, the  film comes to an exciting finish.This film shares certain similarities  with an earlier picture, ""The Conversation"" (1974), which was directed by Francis Ford Coppola.  He twisted Paramount's arm to release this picture before he directed ""The Godfather Part II.""  Both pictures deal with the subject of surveillance and both starred Gene Hackman and Hackman's surveillance laboratory actually resembles that shown in the earlier film, although with lots more fancy equipment, of course.  The earlier film is arguably Gene Hackman's finest screen role and is a film with considerably greater depth than ""Enemy of the State."".",3,Good Picture -- Sometimes a Little Predictable,1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,2283,"['Enemy', 'State', 'entertaining', 'fast-paced', 'movie', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'fine', 'cast', 'are', 'times', 'though', 'when', 'story', 'punches.NOTE', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS.In', 'first', 'scene', 'senator', 'portrayed', 'late', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'squabble', 'gang', 'surveillance', 'NSA', 'men', 'know', ""n't"", 'going', 'come', 'scene', 'alive', 'out', 'murder', 'senator', 'occurring', 'lake', 'been', 'photographed', 'environmental', 'camera', 'young', 'technician', 'later', 'film', 'cartridge', 'been', 'photographed', 'gang', 'out', 'trying', 'elude', 'across', 'Will', 'Smith', 'attorney', 'whom', 'previously', 'knew', 'film', 'Will', 'Smith', 'shopping', 'bag', 'off', 'instant', 'said', 'guy', 'will', 'be', 'dead', 'two', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'Sure', 'enough', 'Later', 'when', 'Smith', 'apartment', 'woman', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'important', 'information', 'see', 'approaching', 'apartment', 'door', 'point', 'said', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'find', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'Sure', 'enough', 'stiff.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'first', 'hour', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'as', 'fine', 'Will', 'Smith', 'performance', 'Hackman', 'portrayal', 'surveillance', 'expert', 'old', 'days', 'really', 'up', 'picture', 'great', 'screen', 'presence', 'good', 'humor', 'Smith', 'Hackman', 'fall', 'together', 'out', 'out', 'Hackman', 'better', 'surveillance', 'game', 'NSA', 'guys', 'are', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'excellent', 'lead', 'NSA', 'heavy', 'several', 'chases', 'few', 'explosions', 'film', 'exciting', 'finish.This', 'film', 'shares', 'certain', 'similarities', 'earlier', 'picture', 'Conversation', '1974', 'was', 'directed', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'twisted', 'Paramount', 'arm', 'release', 'picture', 'directed', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'II', 'pictures', 'deal', 'subject', 'surveillance', 'starred', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Hackman', 'surveillance', 'laboratory', 'actually', 'shown', 'earlier', 'film', 'lots', 'more', 'fancy', 'equipment', 'course', 'earlier', 'film', 'arguably', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'finest', 'screen', 'role', 'film', 'considerably', 'greater', 'depth', 'Enemy', 'State']",Enemy Of The State

OK, whatever...the viewer obviously knows that Will Smith will emerge from this harrowing adventure more or less intact, so there really isn't any tension created by putting his character in peril.  Therefore, the only tension &amp; suspense the producers of this film can hope to create comes from playing on the audience's sense of paranoia.  &quot;Oh my god, what if the government really IS watching my every word &amp; deed?&quot;  thinks the audience.  Oh my god, this could actually be happening!  All you have to do is read some of the reviews here and you will see that paranoia is a major factor in this film's appeal.All I could think of as I watched this film is, give me a break.  One rogue NSA bureaucrat, supported by a handfull of computer geeks, and they are supposed to be able to conduct an operation this vast?  Are you kidding me?  Has anyone ever heard of information overload?  I don't doubt that a good deal of this technology exists, but let's get real folks --- if the NSA was really conducting surveillance on this scale, the amount of raw data the agency would have to sift through simply boggles the mind.  The NSA would have to employ half the population of the USA to spy on the other half.  If the NSA's surveillance is this bush-league, most of us could commit all manner of security breaches and never get caught!  Ironically, I found myself feeling more secure about not being scrutinized by the government after having seen this film.As to the film itself --- sure, all the chase scenes were gripping, the camera angles were great, blah blah blah.  The production values in this movie are top-notch, but so what?  Bruckheimer &amp; Tony Scott can do movies like this in their sleep, so it's no big deal.  The same can be said for Jon Voight &amp; Gene Hackman, who pretty much phone it in with their roles.  From a production standpoint, this movie is indistinguishable from the hundreds of other so-called thrillers that the Hollywood machine has churned out over the last few years.  Ho hum.

Dean doesn't know he has it, but the people ivolved in the murder do know. And they are prepared for anything in order to get back that type, even if that means destroying Dean's life. But Dean isn't willing to let that happen, even if he doesn't know why they want to destroy them.What we got here is an intelligent film directed by Tony Scott and for my taste, the best of his career. But that's just my opinion. I was a little skeptical at first, because I didn't think Will Smith could deliver a dramatic performance, but he surprised me, and I am sure I wasn't the only one. Of course, Gene Hackman, Jason Lee, Jon Voight, Barry Pepper, Jack Black, Seth Green, Jamie Kennedy, Scott Caan, Tom Sizemore and Gabriel Byrne have their good things, too. It's an awesome cast in my opinion and they all do their job better than one would expect. I can only complaint about the little screen time Gabriel Byrne has, but it's really ok. And Tom Sizemore, wow, he's great in this one as an italian mobster and who, in my opinion, has the greatest line in the film.Note that I only give this film 4 stars, but that's because of the DVD edition. It is so lame when it could have been so great. The film gets 5 stars, not the DVD.Maybe the technology shown in the movie is a little overwhelming and for those who are not into the state of the art electronic devices, this film may seem too far-fetched. The music is superb and the main theme is really a beautiful music piece that really grabs the essence of this movie, which is, in my opinion, the end of privacy. How your actions, even in the privacy of your bedroom, your computer, phone calls, e-mail... everything, can be tapped just to ensure national security. Of course, it's a step beyond, but definately, very plausible.What's more important to you? Privacy or safety? And if it is indeed safety, how do we know that the people monitoring us aren't using that power for selfish purposes, like depicted in this film. Are we willing to give up our privacy just to feel safe? And how safe would you feel knowing that someone is watching you or listening to everyword that comes out of your mouth? ""Only privacy that's left is inside your head and maybe that's enough"" one of the characters says. And after September 11, after many of us lost that sense of security, I am quite sure that this would be an interesting debate. To paraphrase another of the characters, ""when buildings start blowing up, people priorities tend to change"". He's got a point there. But who's there to tell which person is trustworthy enough for me to trust him my privacy, my life?As Larry King says in the last line of the film: ""how do we draw the line between protection of National Security, obviously the government's need to obtain intelligence data, and the protection of civil liberties, particularly the sanctity of my home?

463998,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,6305428115,darragh o'donoghue,"[2, 6]","'Enemy Of The State' is a mostly enjoyable exercise in 'North By Northwest' Lite.  Will Smith is the professional who becomes an innocent on the run from both the bad guys and the Law.  The novelty in this case is that both are the same - and when the axis of evil has the resources of the State behind it, the odds are fairly stacked against its enemies.  Of course, like Cary Grant in Hitchcock's film, Smith isn't really innocent - though essentially decent and a loving father, he is complacent, arrogant, politically apathetic, and has cheated on his wife.  He has an Oedipal problem to work through, having to put a bossy wife-mother in her place and supercede a father figure (Brill).  The subsequent peril he undergoes is a purgatorial chastening, a test he must take to prove himself an adequate, trustworthy family man again.  Anything that gets in the way - be it the Mob who threaten his client, or the woman he had the affair with - must be removed.  It is good to remember this dubiously punitive aspect of the film whenever anyone talks about its liberal paranoia.I nearly fell off my chair laughing when I read that certain critics who should know better took the film's 'politics' of paranoia seriously: some even suggesting a family resemblance to Coppola's 'The Conversation' (Gene Hackman plays a similar character in both films), one of the most difficult films in American cinema.  'Enemy' is not difficult or ambiguious or doubting - it knows exactly what it stands for.  Unlike Hitchcock, who used his camera to implicate the viewer in his matrices of voyeurism, Scott's camera stands outside the various weapons of surveillance of the film, uncovering, rather than spying; clarifying, rather than obscuring.  Unlike Coppola's film, we know from the start who the enemy is and what his weapons are - it's merely a matter of being vigilant and getting rid of him.  Yeah right.Tony Scott is no more interested in political paranoia than he was in flag-waving or militarism in 'Top Gun'.  Both narratives give him a structure within which he can practise his vision of Total Cinema.  So the best bits of 'Enemy' are the chases - the splattersome pursuit of Jason Lee; the whole hotel sequence with Hackman, as Smith is sought by increasingly hysterical Feds; and the tunnel run - even if these are more Keystone than Keaton.  It is less interesting when people make speeches about privacy, the 'surveillance society' and the connections between the telecommunications industry (whoops!) and the military-industrial-complex (or whatever it is).  If I want to know about politics or threats to my civil liberties or Establishment fascism in the US, I'll go to a newspaper, NOT Hollywood.  Still, in the 'light' of 'recent events', 'Enemy' has a lot more bite than it used to, with references to both US-backed Afghans and pretzels.",3,Chase film with pretensions.,1013385600,"02 11, 2002",2002,2850,"[""'Enemy"", 'State', 'mostly', 'enjoyable', 'exercise', ""'North"", 'Northwest', 'Lite', 'Will', 'Smith', 'professional', 'who', 'innocent', 'run', 'bad', 'guys', 'Law', 'novelty', 'case', 'are', 'same', 'when', 'axis', 'evil', 'resources', 'State', 'odds', 'are', 'fairly', 'stacked', 'enemies', 'course', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'Smith', ""n't"", 'really', 'innocent', 'essentially', 'decent', 'loving', 'father', 'complacent', 'arrogant', 'politically', 'apathetic', 'cheated', 'wife', 'Oedipal', 'problem', 'work', 'having', 'put', 'bossy', 'wife-mother', 'place', 'supercede', 'father', 'figure', 'Brill', 'subsequent', 'peril', 'purgatorial', 'chastening', 'test', 'must', 'take', 'prove', 'adequate', 'trustworthy', 'family', 'man', 'again', 'Anything', 'way', 'be', 'Mob', 'who', 'threaten', 'client', 'woman', 'had', 'affair', 'must', 'be', 'removed', 'good', 'remember', 'dubiously', 'punitive', 'aspect', 'film', 'whenever', 'anyone', 'liberal', 'paranoia.I', 'nearly', 'fell', 'off', 'chair', 'laughing', 'when', 'read', 'certain', 'critics', 'who', 'should', 'know', 'better', 'took', 'film', ""'politics"", ""'"", 'paranoia', 'seriously', 'even', 'suggesting', 'family', 'resemblance', 'Coppola', ""'The"", 'Conversation', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'similar', 'character', 'films', 'one', 'most', 'difficult', 'films', 'American', 'cinema', 'not', 'difficult', 'ambiguious', 'doubting', 'exactly', 'what', 'Unlike', 'Hitchcock', 'who', 'used', 'camera', 'implicate', 'viewer', 'matrices', 'voyeurism', 'Scott', 'camera', 'various', 'weapons', 'surveillance', 'film', 'uncovering', 'rather', 'spying', 'clarifying', 'rather', 'obscuring', 'Coppola', 'film', 'know', 'start', 'who', 'enemy', 'what', 'weapons', 'are', 'merely', 'matter', 'being', 'vigilant', 'getting', 'rid', 'Yeah', 'right.Tony', 'Scott', 'more', 'interested', 'political', 'paranoia', 'was', 'flag-waving', 'militarism', ""'Top"", 'Gun', 'narratives', 'give', 'structure', 'can', 'practise', 'vision', 'Total', 'Cinema', 'best', 'bits', ""'Enemy"", 'are', 'chases', 'splattersome', 'pursuit', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'whole', 'hotel', 'sequence', 'Hackman', 'Smith', 'sought', 'increasingly', 'hysterical', 'Feds', 'tunnel', 'run', 'even', 'are', 'more', 'Keystone', 'Keaton', 'less', 'interesting', 'when', 'people', 'make', 'speeches', 'privacy', ""'surveillance"", 'society', 'connections', 'telecommunications', 'industry', 'whoops', 'military-industrial-complex', 'whatever', 'want', 'know', 'politics', 'threats', 'civil', 'liberties', 'Establishment', 'fascism', 'US', ""'ll"", 'go', 'newspaper', 'NOT', 'Hollywood', 'Still', ""'light"", ""'recent"", 'events', ""'Enemy"", 'lot', 'more', 'bite', 'used', 'references', 'US-backed', 'Afghans', 'pretzels']",Enemy Of The State

Released in 1998, the plot could be taken from today's headlines.  In response to terrorist actions and threats, legislation is introduced allowing government extremely wide latitude in surveillance and curtailing personal privacy.  Key members of the government itself, however, are sociopaths--totally amoral in the pursuit of their own ambitions.  Sound familiar?  It's a tale we've heard all too often.  Director Tony Scott plays to the audience's distrust of authority rather than their fear of terrorism--perhaps if the movie were made today it would have a different slant.  But government has seemingly gotten no purer, and officials are keen to grab exactly those rights that this movie is concerned with.As for the rest, Will Smith and Gene Hackman turn in terrific performances.  The action is continuously thrilling, although excessive in the number and length of chase scenes.  Although occasionally we have to suspend our disbelief, the climax of the movie provides a payoff so clever that we are happy to do so. The music, by former Yes guitarist Tevor Rabin and a collaborator, suits the action well but doesn't particularly stand out significantly.

464030,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6305428115,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 3]","ENEMY OF THE STATE is flashy, big budget, adrenalin-pumping cinema as only director Tony Scott and producer Jerry Bruckheimer can concoct. It's raucously entertaining and most certainly a strident rallying film for the conspiracy theorists. Now I don't know just how accurate the movie is in terms of the technology depicted (I'd say fairly accurate) or of the dubious lengths to which our government will stoop to achieve its ends, but, certainly, the sincere and bravura acting of the high powered cast lends this over the top film an element of plausibility.Several SPOILERS here: When a nature photographer (Jason Lee) accidentally tapes the cold-blooded murder of a high profile congressman, it sets off a chain of events which horrifyingly affects and endangers Washington, D.C. attorney Robert Dean (Will Smith). When a corrupt, high ranking agent of the National Security Agency comes to believe that Dean has in his possession evidence which will incriminate him, he and his henchmen turn Dean's universe instantly topsy turvy; as a result of their manipulations, Robert Dean is summarily fired from his law firm, framed in the newspaper, accused of having an affair with an ex-flame and current informant, and stripped of his finances. Even his cell phone stops functioning. He is bugged six ways from Sunday and is reduced to running for his life clad in his undies. It's hard work evading these determined people as Dean is easily pinpointed by the NSA's use of aerial surveillance and sundry tracking devices. But Dean receives unexpected aid from an enigmatic ex-intelligence agent (Gene Hackman, again acting with ferocity) as he tries desperately to stay one step ahead of his powerful, omnipresent pursuers and somehow salvage the remnants of his life.You have to hand it to Scott and Bruckheimer, when they get together (DEJA VU, CRIMSON TIDE, TOP GUN), their enthusiasm knows no bounds. This rapidly paced hi-tech thriller/chase film takes Hitchcock's innocent man on the run premise and inserts its own brand of polished action sequences and well-executed stunts/fx. There's no questioning it's slickness. It's also enhanced by the solid performances of everyman Will Smith, the surly Gene Hackman, and the villainous Jon Voight. Regina King, Jamie Kennedy, Jack Black, and Lisa Bonet (still sexy) all contribute nicely in supporting roles.ENEMY OF THE STATE is a cautionary fable which raises the issue of national security and of our government's constant need to gather intel for our own protection, but juxtaposed against that is the violation incurred to our civil rights, and, how, depending on the man, certain moral lines are easier to cross in pursuit of the big picture.

As far as reviewers who talk about this not being as good as 1974's The Conversation, get a clue that elements of this movie are conscious homages to that earlier (and IMO, badly dated, and overrated) movie--one of the things that's fun about Bruckheimer's movies is that they are full of homages to earlier suspense/action flicks, esp. those that influenced him. Also, folks, get a clue to the fact that the Will Smith character's ""dumbness"" and naivety, is part of the point of this movie: his ignorance of technology, and his over-reliance on other people for information, put him at the mercy of the ""heavies"" in this movie, and left him wide open to the crisis in which he found himself embroiled.

464046,A27CHILBK6HIL2,6305428115,Kaya Savas,"[74, 88]","MOVIE: Enemy of The State is another one of Jerry Bruckheimer's mid 90's action extravaganzas. He reunites with Tony Scott to bring us this action flick about government coverups and how technology is used to basically track every aspect of your life. The movie is about a lawyer who is unwillingly thrown into a wild cat and mouse chase. A congressman is murdered near a reservoir where research is done on migratory geese. So, unknowingly, the whole thing is caught on tape and ends up in the hands of a nerdy and young Jason Lee. He realizes what he has in his possession and during a foot chase he bumps into his old friend played by Will Smith and secretly drops the tape in his bag. Now Will Smith's character is thrown into a world of espionage without knowing why he is being hunted. He meets up with Brill, played by Gene Hackman, an ex NSA agent who ends up helping him. Hackman basically plays a reincarnation of his character in Coppola's The Conversation. The movie is directed at a fast pace by Tony Scott, and it's an overall entertaining action flick. I felt the movie tried to be smarter than it actually was and that the characters were very plain and boring.ACTING: I didn't like Hackman in this role, but Will Smith brought some life into the movie. For people who haven't seen the movie in awhile you should check it out to recognize some young faces including Jack Black, Jake Busey, Jaimie Kennedy, Seth Green, and the of course the previously mentioned Jason Lee.VIDEO: The great thing about the recent releases of Con Air, Crimson Tide, and Enemy Of The State are the new anamorphic transfers of the films. They are greatly appreciated and are so much better than the old ones. The quality of the transfer has not improved greatly in terms of picture quality, but there is a noticeable difference.AUDIO: As for sound we get a very dull Dolby 5.1 mix. All the dialogue is usually center heavy, and rarely does action actually envelope you from the surround speakers. The track is the same from the old release, so it's not the best. There are some scenes with helicopters and some big explosions that utilize the surround speakers well, but overall it's a very dull mix.SPECIAL FEATURES: The ""making of"" featurette was actually more extensive than I was expecting. They talk more about the gadgets used in the film versus the actual movie, but overall I found it to be interesting. All the interviews were done back during the making of the movie and it was a pretty extensive behind the scenes for what the movie is. One thing I found extremely interesting was that they talked about a scene where Will Smith is chased by cars in an underground tunnel in his bathrobe. In reality, the cars didn't fit into the tunnel so they had do take the cars apart and weld them back together in the tunnel. The entire scene was maybe a minute long! I just found it interesting that all that work was done for maybe a blip of action. Anyway, the next featurette is basically some on set footage. Overall the two featurettes do justice for what this movie is.BOTTOM LINE: I got confused whether this was indeed an ""extended"" cut of the film or not. The cover you see on places like Amazon is not the cover that you actually get.

While waiting he's just been had a videotape sliped into his bag containing a congressman's assassination. Right on his back for this tape is a ruthless group of National Security Agents commanded by a hostile fed named Reynolds (Jon Voight). Using surveillance from satellites, bugs, and other sophisticated snooping devices, the NSA infiltrates every facet of Dean's existence, tracing each physical and digital footprint he leaves. Driven by acute paranoia, Dean enlists the help of a clandestine former NSA operative named Brill (Gene Hackman), and Enemy of the State kicks into high-intensity hyperdrive.

This has to be close to the finest film Will Smith has ever made, and it's hard to see why it didn't do a lot better at the box office.If anything, its even more relevant than the day it was released. None of the technology is fictional, (despite some comments) it's all in deployment right now.Ironically, since the enactment of the Patriot act in the USA, and the second act more recently, this film has assumed a quite weirdly prophetic status. Many comments recently made about the changing character about America (See Tim Robbins recent address to the National Press club) are very to the point here and can't be ignored. It's so easy to see that people like Jerry Falwell are now coming very close to issuing the kind of frightening rhetoric seen in this film - art has met the horizon of reality all too quickly.Perhaps though, the film's single most biting comment is on the nature of the lobby system and the problem of the separation of judicial and executive powers in the USA, which if anything is far more malefidious and dangerous than what the film depicts.But, sufficient to say, all this is nothing compared with Hackmans gem of a performance of terse and cranky sainthood. He excels at the hero - putting everything into his character.  This only gives the film more authenticity and a really hard edge.I just can't fault this movie.

That killing is caught on tape and the tape falls into the hands of a researcher who then slips the tape into a shopping bag carried by Will Smith's character.From there the action takes off at a breathtaking pace. The parts are flawlessly acted - John Voight is the perfect embodiment of the stereotypical evil politician, Will Smith is the helpless victim, and Gene Hackman is the brilliant strategist who pulls the entire film together. I won't say more as I wouldn't want to spoil the suspense.The thing about this movie is it seems so terrifyingly real.

464069,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305428115,Matthew Horner,"[6, 7]","Enemy of the State may be the best thriller about an innocent man on the run since the movie version of Mission: Impossible. Admittedly, such movies are largely the same story told over and over again with differing interpretations, but director Tony Scott's retelling is one of the most innovative.These movies almost always revolve around a man caught in the grips of some paranoid government agency. This time, it's the audience that needs to be paranoid, because if such a situation ever happens in real life, we are all up the creek. What makes this one so creepy is the fact that some of the technology depicted actually exists.The affable Will Smith plays a Washington, DC attorney named Robert Dean. The character is somewhat prone to getting himself into hot water, and when he bumps into an old school chum, he gets some information a federal agency will literally kill to get back. To compound the problem, Dean doesn't even know he possesses such dangerous information. Even when it becomes apparent that some group is after him, as well as his family and friends, he is at first clueless as to what they want and then totally unaware of where what they want is. He's got a definite problem.The people out to get him work for the Federal Information Agency, which has managed to link together all of our telecommunications technology. They can tap any type of digital telephone and pager at will. They can instantly pull up records on any citizen. They have installed video cameras everywhere and can tap into most private security cameras. If necessary, they can follow people almost anywhere by calling up any of hundred of satellites spinning around Earth. The agency is truly a nightmare come true.What Dean doesn't know he has is a videotape of a murder. The agency has dispatched an uncooperative Congressman and made it look like an accident. The scene was unwittingly recorded by Dean's old friend, who, realizing what he has and being chased by the bad guys, slips it to Dean moments before his own death.All of this is done at break neck speed. The movie starts with a bang, and they keep coming until it's over. There is some very fancy camera work and lots of well done special effects. The music is innovative, with a full orchestra playing melodically against an intense electronic theme.Will Smith seems to be able to do anything. He has been a TV star. He remains a very successful singer. He's starred in two huge hits, Men in Black and Independence Day. This summer he plays in Wild, Wild West. In Enemy of the State, however, the limits of his acting range are more apparent. It's not because this is any more serious than his other films, but because he is playing against two acting giants, Gene Hackman and Jon Voight. Voight is truly menacing as Thomas Reynolds, the man in the agency behind the murder. Hackman is superb as Edward Lyle, the technological master who is Dean's one chance of survival. Not only have these two been making movies since before Smith was born, they both received Academy award nominations when they were about his age. I do like Smith a great deal, and it is possible that he will turn out to be a late bloomer, much like Clint Eastwood and Harrison Ford, who both seemed one- dimensional until they were nearly forty.",4,An intense 'man on the run' thriller,1016841600,"03 23, 2002",2002,3282,"['Enemy', 'State', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'thriller', 'innocent', 'man', 'run', 'movie', 'version', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'Admittedly', 'such', 'movies', 'are', 'largely', 'same', 'story', 'told', 'over', 'again', 'differing', 'interpretations', 'director', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'retelling', 'one', 'most', 'innovative.These', 'movies', 'almost', 'always', 'revolve', 'man', 'caught', 'grips', 'paranoid', 'government', 'agency', 'time', 'audience', 'be', 'paranoid', 'such', 'situation', 'ever', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'creek', 'What', 'one', 'so', 'creepy', 'fact', 'technology', 'depicted', 'actually', 'exists.The', 'affable', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Washington', 'DC', 'attorney', 'named', 'Robert', 'Dean', 'character', 'somewhat', 'prone', 'getting', 'hot', 'water', 'when', 'bumps', 'old', 'school', 'chum', 'information', 'federal', 'agency', 'will', 'literally', 'kill', 'get', 'back', 'compound', 'problem', 'Dean', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'such', 'dangerous', 'information', 'Even', 'when', 'apparent', 'group', 'as', 'well', 'family', 'friends', 'first', 'clueless', 'what', 'want', 'then', 'totally', 'unaware', 'where', 'what', 'want', 'got', 'definite', 'problem.The', 'people', 'out', 'get', 'work', 'Federal', 'Information', 'Agency', 'managed', 'link', 'together', 'telecommunications', 'technology', 'can', 'tap', 'type', 'digital', 'telephone', 'pager', 'will', 'can', 'instantly', 'pull', 'up', 'records', 'citizen', 'have', 'installed', 'video', 'cameras', 'everywhere', 'can', 'tap', 'most', 'private', 'security', 'cameras', 'necessary', 'can', 'follow', 'people', 'almost', 'anywhere', 'calling', 'up', 'hundred', 'satellites', 'spinning', 'around', 'Earth', 'agency', 'truly', 'nightmare', 'come', 'Dean', ""n't"", 'know', 'videotape', 'murder', 'agency', 'dispatched', 'uncooperative', 'Congressman', 'made', 'look', 'accident', 'scene', 'was', 'unwittingly', 'recorded', 'Dean', 'old', 'friend', 'who', 'realizing', 'what', 'being', 'chased', 'bad', 'guys', 'Dean', 'moments', 'own', 'death.All', 'done', 'break', 'neck', 'speed', 'movie', 'bang', 'keep', 'coming', 'over', 'very', 'fancy', 'camera', 'work', 'lots', 'well', 'done', 'special', 'effects', 'music', 'innovative', 'full', 'orchestra', 'playing', 'melodically', 'intense', 'electronic', 'theme.Will', 'Smith', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'anything', 'been', 'TV', 'star', 'very', 'successful', 'singer', 'starred', 'two', 'huge', 'hits', 'Men', 'Black', 'Independence', 'Day', 'summer', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'Enemy', 'State', 'however', 'limits', 'acting', 'range', 'are', 'more', 'apparent', 'not', 'more', 'serious', 'other', 'films', 'playing', 'two', 'acting', 'giants', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Voight', 'truly', 'menacing', 'Thomas', 'Reynolds', 'man', 'agency', 'murder', 'Hackman', 'superb', 'Edward', 'Lyle', 'technological', 'master', 'who', 'Dean', 'one', 'chance', 'survival', 'Not', 'only', 'have', 'two', 'been', 'making', 'movies', 'Smith', 'was', 'born', 'received', 'Academy', 'award', 'nominations', 'when', 'were', 'age', 'do', 'Smith', 'great', 'deal', 'possible', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'late', 'bloomer', 'much', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'who', 'seemed', 'one-', 'dimensional', 'were', 'nearly', 'forty']",Enemy Of The State

464095,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,6305428115,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 4]","Will Smith is Robert Clayton Dean, a young yet prominent labor attorney in the DC area who suddenly finds his well ordered life going to hell.  Unknown to him, he's accidentally received a video disc implicating the Deputy Director of Operations of the NSA (Jon Voight) in the suspicious death of an influential senator - a disc passed to him moments before its owner's untimely death.  Unable to locate the disc, the wicked Dep decides to take Dean's life to pieces - finding much in Smith's character that isn't as ordered as it appears.  In fact, Dean's adventures as a labor lawyer frequently have him run up against organized crime bosses, including one played by Tom Sizemore.  Worse, to get his information, Smith relies on a shadowy figure named Brill, a man he's never met.  Instead, he maintains contact with Brill through a former lover (Lisa Bonet).  Drawing a line between Smith and Bonet using their ban accounts, the NSA wreck his personal life and implicate him in embezzlement.  On the run from the super-secret NSA with its satellites and its surveillance gear, with nowhere to turn, Dean's only hope is to find the mysterious Brill himself, learn the secret driving his pursuers and hope to fund some way to put his life back together.Not a lot in ""Enemy"" makes sense, but it's fast and, with Will Smith, often funny.  He's got a flip sense of humor that saves the movie that otherwise has few surprises.  Gene Hackman enters the scene as the shadowy Brill running, and he never stops.  Brill is essentially paranoia incarnate - though by the time we've met him, we know enough about the Government's surveillance methods to empathize with his fears.  Jon Voight plays the latest in a long line of heavies (he was the evil lawyer in ""Rainmaker"") but otherwise never connects as a villain.  But the real star of the flick is the direction, which is fast and coherent at the same time.

Its interesting what the situational awareness the Feds can gain by having an emittor on the Will Smith character, its instructive conceptually as to how you could steer yourself and other units to intercept or stay close without getting too close. But this technology is shown to collapse when the sensors are not &quot;cheating&quot; by the emittor and have to use line-of-sight collection means to stay in contact with their prey in a cluttered urban environment. If you watch the film conceptually as a demonstration of military and possibly totalitarean technology its worth 4 stars.

This follows a Washington attorney (played by Will Smith) who inadvertently get possession of a video containing a political assassination. A NSA team is set up to discredit him and to track down the tape and pretty soon things take a sinister turn, with bugs, tracking devices, stopped credit cards, smear campaigns and more and pretty soon he is way out of his depth. Fortunately he has a contact who is adept in counter surveillance (who he previously bought information from for his legal cases) who is able to assist him in regaining his life and levelling the playing filed with the NSA spooks who are on his tail. Whilst some of the technology and surveillance ideas in this film seem a little far fetched, I am sure some of these techniques are used and even some more we aren't even aware of. You start to contemplate the level of surveillance and privacy in society as more infringements start to unfold throughout the film, not bad for an action flick. The acting is pretty good from all involved and Gene Hackman is excellent and steals the film from Smith, but to be honest the supporting cast is so good that this has worthy performances from all involved. This moves at a fast pace and is directed well, with a real sense of action and also disquiet at the roving satellites that spin overhead.

I focus strictly on the quality of the transfer of the Standard Def version to Blu Ray.  I will say that while this is an older film focusing on govt corruption and wiretapping as well as a U.S. citizens right to privacy, the movie stays relevant and has legs. I do have the standard def version but this is not a side by side comparison.The audio is the star in terms of disc quality.  There is a big difference for any movie between lossless and lossy audio, a transparency that only lossless audio can provide.  On this Blu Ray, it is lossless PCM 5.1.  The audio's levels are nicely set, and if you have a decent surround system, this movie would be considered Demo worthy for showing off your home theater's audio capabilities.  There is much use of all the front and rear surrounds with a goodly amount of panning between the front and rear stages as well as the discreet channeling of foley fx to both the front and rear surrounds.  Your LFE channel does come into play but not overly.  The audio of the standard def version also had excellent surround usage and, thus, I give credit to the original audio editors and mixers.The video transfer of this softly focused and color muted film presents very good contrast, a touch better than the Standard Def version but I do not believe that it is because of remastering.  The bit rate is certainly higher but not a whole lot; it generally averaged between the mid teens and the mid twenties and that higher bit rate accounts for the somewhat better video.  There was minimal film grain, no artifacting or imaging issues.  Never the less, I do not believe that you will see a night and day difference between the video of the Standard Def and BluRay versions.  If you do not already have the film, certainly go for it on Blu Ray but if  you do have the Standard Def version, don't expect a whole lot of difference.The extras consisted of some deleted scenes however there was no 'play all' button so each time a deleted scene was done, you had to go back to the menu, bring up the 'extras', go to the 'Deleted Scenes', find the next scene and select.  What a pain in the butt!

Not knowing that the trivial meeting with an old friend would cause him so much trouble, Dean gets sucked into a conspiracy case involving a rogue National Security Agent (Jon Voight) who killed a United States congressman because he accidentally received a video tape with footage of the murder.  With incredible surveillance techniques and technology, Voight is able to track all of the lawyer's moves and keep tabs on him.Our hero's life is turned upside down until he meets up with a stealthy former NSA active named Brill (played very well by Gene Hackman).  With the assistance of Brill, Dean attacks the government head on and must learn the truth in order to save his life.  Director Tony Scott brilliantly uses the camera to portray his views, jolting the characters through a series of incredible chase scenes, rip-roaring explosions, and intense firearm combat, but ultimately ""Enemy of the State"" focuses solely on the unbridled advances in special effects abilities that it keeps the audience from understanding the story and getting involved with the characters.  Smith is only adequate in his first major ""dramatic"" role, while Hackman and Voight pick up some of the slack in their devilishly effective parts.  A must-see if you are into big explosions and dynamite cinematography, but one to leave on the shelf if over-acting and a mediocre script are an annoyance.",3,Enemy of the State  (1998),1085875200,"05 30, 2004",2004,1793,"['Director', 'Tony', 'ScottCast', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Regina', 'King', 'Loren', 'Dean', 'Jake', 'Busey', 'Barry', 'Pepper.Running', 'Time', '127', 'minutes.Rated', 'R', 'violence', 'language.Another', 'producer', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer/director', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'thrill', 'ride', 'substance', 'time', 'pitting', 'family', 'man', 'lawyer', 'Robert', 'Clayton', 'Dean', 'played', 'Will', 'Smith', 'ho-hum', 'performance', 'technologically-driven', 'government', 'Not', 'knowing', 'trivial', 'meeting', 'old', 'friend', 'would', 'cause', 'so', 'much', 'trouble', 'Dean', 'sucked', 'conspiracy', 'case', 'involving', 'rogue', 'National', 'Security', 'Agent', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'who', 'killed', 'United', 'States', 'congressman', 'accidentally', 'received', 'video', 'tape', 'footage', 'murder', 'incredible', 'surveillance', 'techniques', 'technology', 'Voight', 'able', 'track', 'lawyer', 'moves', 'keep', 'tabs', 'him.Our', 'hero', 'life', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'up', 'stealthy', 'former', 'NSA', 'active', 'named', 'Brill', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'assistance', 'Brill', 'Dean', 'government', 'head', 'must', 'learn', 'truth', 'order', 'save', 'life', 'Director', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'brilliantly', 'camera', 'portray', 'views', 'jolting', 'characters', 'series', 'incredible', 'chase', 'scenes', 'rip-roaring', 'explosions', 'intense', 'firearm', 'combat', 'ultimately', 'Enemy', 'State', 'solely', 'unbridled', 'advances', 'special', 'effects', 'abilities', 'audience', 'understanding', 'story', 'getting', 'involved', 'characters', 'Smith', 'only', 'adequate', 'first', 'major', 'dramatic', 'role', 'Hackman', 'Voight', 'pick', 'up', 'slack', 'devilishly', 'effective', 'parts', 'must-see', 'are', 'big', 'explosions', 'dynamite', 'cinematography', 'one', 'leave', 'shelf', 'over-acting', 'mediocre', 'script', 'are', 'annoyance']",Enemy Of The State

His friend from school drops something into his bag without telling Smith that it is an important government tape that could get him killed.  The friend meets his demise and Smith is stuck with the tape.

The film also has lots of electronic gimmicks (satellite surveillance is the thing here with lots of satellite visuals and close ups...); there is also some clever action. All in all I have to admit it is quite interesting to watch and you do remain hooked to the screen. However, the plot is corny and banal and I cannot help but wonder - what about some new story line...? How many times can we see a movie that has the following tale: an innocent regular citizen (one who has some unique quality like being a computer genius, especially clever, etc.) gets caught in a corrupt scheme that originates from someplace high in power (be it some high government office, national security forces, etc.). Our innocent hero's life is shattered and he finds himself on the run fighting an unknown enemy equipped with all the modern electronic equipment. Our innocent hero has only himself to count on and sometimes some unexpected help. Step by step he starts to understand what happened and to uncover the big scheme...our hero succeeds after going through an ordeal (miraculously saving his life time and again) and returns to normal life. This is more or less the story line of ""Enemy of the state"" and can be also attributed to many other movies. ""The Pelican Brief"", ""Bourne Identity"", ""the Net"" ""No way out"" would be naming just a few.By scaring you with all the ways the government can monitor the little citizen's behaviour (or supposedly monitor - it is hard to believe they can do all that is portrayed) the movie is also trying to make a statement about privacy.
