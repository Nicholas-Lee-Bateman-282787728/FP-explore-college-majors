But I bought this DVD hoping that if it was in Widescreen, its aspect ratio would've been something like 1:85 or less(you have to know literally about DVD terminology to know what I'm talking about).  When I received this DVD in the mail, I immediately popped it into my DVD recorder and started to watch it.  I found that it was in its original widescreen format(being 2:35)and that I couldn't get rid of those stupid &#34;black bars&#34; on the top and bottom of the movie.  i HATE WATCHING DVD MOVIES WITH THAT SITUATION ALWAYS BEING THERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  If anyone reads this review and knows what I'm talking about, this DVD should be taken back to the Editing Room and brought out to DVD in an aspect ratio of 1:85 or less.  Again, that's just my opinion",3,this DVD needs to be done a better way,1368057600,"05 9, 2013",2013,944,"['review', 'movie', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'review', 'yes', 'wanted', 'DVD', 'only', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'theaters', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'bought', 'DVD', 'hoping', 'was', 'Widescreen', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'something', '1:85', 'less', 'have', 'know', 'literally', 'DVD', 'terminology', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'When', 'received', 'DVD', 'mail', 'immediately', 'popped', 'DVD', 'recorder', 'started', 'watch', 'found', 'was', 'original', 'widescreen', 'format', 'being', '2:35', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'rid', 'stupid', '34', 'black', 'bars', '34', 'top', 'bottom', 'movie', 'i', 'HATE', 'WATCHING', 'DVD', 'MOVIES', 'WITH', 'THAT', 'SITUATION', 'ALWAYS', 'BEING', 'THERE', 'anyone', 'review', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'back', 'Editing', 'Room', 'brought', 'out', 'DVD', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1:85', 'less', 'Again', 'just', 'opinion']",Surge of Power
963050,A1KISYZSUGHL5P,B000CZ0PWQ,David Romano,"[7, 7]","This film really does recall the feel of the old ""Batman"" tv show and the really bad 70's superhero films like ""Spiderman"" and ""Captain America"".  The dialogue is campy, and it's meant to be.  The effects and ""fights"" fall into the same category.  I was awaiting the colorful and cartoonish ""POW"" effects to pop up on the screen.  Think ""Legends of the Superheroes"" (if you can find it!).There was also definitely a pop culture element to it.  A lot of references to modern superheroes.  And the discussion of the cape (as well as showing its pitfalls!).  Ahhh, reminiscent of ""The Incredibles"".  Ths isn't the big-budget superhero flicks like the ""X-Men"" or ""Spiderman"", and it's not meant to be.  You're warned.  And the geek factor was present.  I loved the scene where the comic-book geeks get smacked down by the jocks, only to hear the jocks talk about playing on their X-Boxes.  Priceless... ""Why can they play X Box, but we can't read comic books?"" And let us not forget our faithful hero doing the ""Wonder Woman Spin"".  Again, priceless.There were times, however, when this film went waaaay over the top.  I respect the fact it's a small, indie, gay flick.  And I appreciate it, Lord knows as a gay comic book fan I've been let down several times by Marvel's ""gay"" characters like Northstar, Karma, and Sunpyre.  But there were times when I felt like it was ""too gay"".  The double entendres got a bit tiresome after a bit, like a bad skit drug out too long.  So I can see why some folks will be turned off by the movie.It was a fun little film, didn't take itself too seriously, I can see some of my friends and I in it, but it needed to lay off the social agenda a bit.  So three stars.",3,"Campy and goofy, but at times a bit over-the-top",1147996800,"05 19, 2006",2006,1696,"['film', 'really', 'recall', 'feel', 'old', 'Batman', 'tv', 'show', 'really', 'bad', '70', 'superhero', 'films', 'Spiderman', 'Captain', 'America', 'dialogue', 'campy', 'meant', 'be', 'effects', 'fights', 'fall', 'same', 'category', 'was', 'awaiting', 'colorful', 'cartoonish', 'POW', 'effects', 'pop', 'up', 'screen', 'Think', 'Legends', 'Superheroes', 'can', 'find', '.There', 'was', 'also', 'definitely', 'pop', 'culture', 'element', 'lot', 'references', 'modern', 'superheroes', 'discussion', 'cape', 'as', 'well', 'showing', 'pitfalls', 'Ahhh', 'reminiscent', 'Incredibles', 'Ths', ""n't"", 'big-budget', 'superhero', 'flicks', 'X-Men', 'Spiderman', 'not', 'meant', 'be', ""'re"", 'warned', 'geek', 'factor', 'was', 'present', 'loved', 'scene', 'where', 'comic-book', 'geeks', 'get', 'smacked', 'down', 'jocks', 'only', 'hear', 'jocks', 'talk', 'playing', 'X-Boxes', 'Priceless', 'Why', 'can', 'play', 'X', 'Box', 'ca', ""n't"", 'read', 'comic', 'books', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'faithful', 'hero', 'doing', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Spin', 'Again', 'priceless.There', 'were', 'times', 'however', 'when', 'film', 'went', 'waaaay', 'top', 'respect', 'fact', 'small', 'indie', 'gay', 'flick', 'appreciate', 'Lord', 'gay', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'been', 'let', 'down', 'several', 'times', 'Marvel', 'gay', 'characters', 'Northstar', 'Karma', 'Sunpyre', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'felt', 'was', 'too', 'gay', 'double', 'entendres', 'got', 'bit', 'tiresome', 'bit', 'bad', 'skit', 'drug', 'too', 'long', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'folks', 'will', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'movie.It', 'was', 'fun', 'little', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'can', 'see', 'friends', 'needed', 'lay', 'off', 'social', 'agenda', 'bit', 'So', 'three', 'stars']",Surge of Power

Wiersma ""ksmichael""","[5, 5]","I try to avoid making general statements about the quality of acting in gay films, as it's usually somewhat sub-par, or should I say sometimes sub-par acting is okay if everything else falls together and then you have a decent film.Not here.Every scene feels like a bad high school play.  I can't believe all these semi-stars showed up for this terrible mess.  I feel especially bad for Michelle Nichols, clearly out of everyone's acting league here.  Hers is the only decent acting during the entirety of this film. And the only few moments when you feel some sincerity and, perhaps, some meaning in all the messiness here.There are a couple cute guys, and some nice costumes, and lots of nods to comic books.  This is a rental, purely.

963053,A2XUMWYA9DH3HS,B000CZ0PWQ,SoCalRay,"[5, 7]","I was at the premiere screening in L.A., where they also showed the ""behind-the-scenes"" featurette that will be on the DVD, so think I have a good idea of what the DVD will be like even though it isn't out yet as I write this. The film was much better than I expected given how it was marketed as ""low-budget"". Yes, the effects are very low budget, but presented in a campy, funny way. There are lots of hilarious references to popular culture comic book superheros like Spiderman, Batman, and Superman, that had the audience laughing in stitches. Although the film is marketed as ""the first (***) superhero movie"", it really is not a film just for a (***) audience, but rather a superhero comedy where the hero happens to be (***). There are also great performances by several celebrities: Nichelle Nichols (Uhura from Star Trek) who gives a divine & classy performance here, plus the very cute grandma-ish Noel Neill (Lois Lane from the Adventures of Superman), Lou Ferrigno (The Hulk), and the always annoyingly queenie Bobby Trendy (Anna Nicole Show). As long as you go into the film knowing you should not take it seriously and that it is just amusing low-brow fun, then you'll like it. I would compare it in style to the 60's Batman TV series. I left the screening wishing there was a ""Surge of Power 2"" coming out as I really enjoyed the characters.",5,Funny & great for comic book & sci-fi fans,1143504000,"03 28, 2006",2006,1356,"['was', 'premiere', 'screening', 'L.A.', 'where', 'also', 'showed', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'will', 'be', 'DVD', 'think', 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'even', ""n't"", 'out', 'yet', 'write', 'film', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'given', 'how', 'was', 'marketed', 'low-budget', 'Yes', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'presented', 'campy', 'funny', 'way', 'are', 'lots', 'hilarious', 'references', 'popular', 'culture', 'comic', 'book', 'superheros', 'Spiderman', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'had', 'audience', 'laughing', 'stitches', 'film', 'marketed', 'first', '***', 'superhero', 'movie', 'really', 'not', 'film', 'just', '***', 'audience', 'rather', 'superhero', 'comedy', 'where', 'hero', 'be', '***', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'performances', 'several', 'celebrities', 'Nichelle', 'Nichols', 'Uhura', 'Star', 'Trek', 'who', 'divine', 'classy', 'performance', 'here', 'very', 'cute', 'grandma-ish', 'Noel', 'Neill', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Adventures', 'Superman', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'Hulk', 'always', 'annoyingly', 'queenie', 'Bobby', 'Trendy', 'Anna', 'Nicole', 'Show', 'As', 'long', 'go', 'film', 'knowing', 'should', 'not', 'take', 'seriously', 'just', 'amusing', 'low-brow', 'fun', 'then', ""'ll"", 'like', 'would', 'compare', 'style', '60', 'Batman', 'TV', 'series', 'left', 'screening', 'wishing', 'there', 'was', 'Surge', 'Power', '2', 'coming', 'out', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'characters']",Surge of Power
