Billing""","[1, 2]","It was an attempt at a view of the characters before they became as corrupt, but there was a lack of character development.  In addition, those portraying Katherine and Sebastian did not even look close to the original characters.  The movie kept my interest, and was somewhat entertaining, but disappointing.  I disagree with other reviewers about the &quot;porn&quot; content of this movie.  There were many innuendos but little graphic nudity.  If you saw the first movie, this film will interest you by somewhat explaining the character's motivations.  However, unless it was given to me, I would not add it to my DVD library.  This movie will make no sense if you have not seen the original Cruel Intentions.

E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Cruel Intentions 2 feels like it's trying to be a comedy, but never really hits the nail on the head when it pertains to actually making me laugh.It's about these rich and spoiled attractive teenage girls that get their kicks playing mind games with a certain boy.It might sound appealing reading the description, but the underwhelming delivery of the storytelling and the overall nonexistent interest factor makes any potential the movie had lose momentum *very* quickly.Sometimes an extremely funny joke will come out of nowhere, but this only seems to happen as a way to make sure you're not drifting to sleep by the boring storyline.This film is definitely one of many that totally breathes the time period of 10 years ago when storylines involving teens seemed to focus on undeveloped character development, along with the laughs and the storytelling not quite worthy enough to make a movie out of it.  This happened *so* many times back in the late 90's/early 00's it's not even funny.It's probably the extreme unbelievability of all the characters involved that makes Cruel Intentions 2 feel like a big fake waste of your precious time.  That's my impression of it at least.  No no, it's the terrible writing.  It's BAD, trust me.A few laughs aside, I can't recommend such a dreadfully boring movie to anybody.",2,not very good at all,1281916800,"08 16, 2010",2010,1317,"['Cruel', 'Intentions', '2', 'feels', 'trying', 'be', 'comedy', 'never', 'really', 'nail', 'head', 'when', 'actually', 'making', 'laugh.It', 'rich', 'spoiled', 'attractive', 'teenage', 'girls', 'get', 'kicks', 'playing', 'mind', 'games', 'certain', 'boy.It', 'might', 'sound', 'appealing', 'reading', 'description', 'underwhelming', 'delivery', 'storytelling', 'overall', 'nonexistent', 'interest', 'factor', 'potential', 'movie', 'had', 'lose', 'momentum', '*very*', 'extremely', 'funny', 'joke', 'will', 'come', 'nowhere', 'only', 'happen', 'way', 'make', 'sure', ""'re"", 'not', 'drifting', 'sleep', 'boring', 'storyline.This', 'film', 'definitely', 'one', 'many', 'totally', 'time', 'period', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'storylines', 'involving', 'teens', 'seemed', 'focus', 'undeveloped', 'character', 'development', 'laughs', 'storytelling', 'not', 'quite', 'worthy', 'enough', 'make', 'movie', 'happened', '*so*', 'many', 'times', 'back', 'late', ""90's/early"", '00', 'not', 'even', 'funny.It', 'probably', 'extreme', 'unbelievability', 'characters', 'involved', 'Cruel', 'Intentions', '2', 'feel', 'big', 'fake', 'waste', 'precious', 'time', 'impression', 'least', 'terrible', 'writing', 'BAD', 'trust', 'me.A', 'few', 'laughs', 'aside', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'such', 'dreadfully', 'boring', 'movie', 'anybody']",Cruel Intentions 2
557263,AGIO6BKKS1BUP,B00004XPPI,"C. Michael Massey ""litterateur""","[6, 10]","This is definitely among the top two or three worst movies I have ever seen in my life. Like some of my fellow reviewers, I really enjoyed the first *Cruel Intentions* and was hoping for something at least somewhat comparable to it in the sequel. This was *not* the case. I admit that I should probably have been clued-in by the cheesy and trashy cover art on the video sleeve, but what can I say--I was still hopeful.Overall, the acting was awful. Robin Dunne and Mimi Rogers were actually the best of the bunch, despite his complete lack of both physical and character resemblance to the first Sebastian and her soap-opera-esque interpretation of Tiffany Merteuil-Valmont. Amy Adams was *terrible* as a childish Kathryn Merteuil, her only apparently redeeming quality seeming to be a very slight facial resemblance to Sarah Michelle Gellar. Otherwise, one moment she's brilliant, evil, and talented; the next moment, she's stupid, self-conscious, and clumsy--*completely* at odds with the original.Most films (even the darker ones) have at least some comic relief. The first *Cruel Intentions* was no exception with its occasional quip, the scene in the retirment home, and the childish, dopey character Cecile Caldwell. What, however, was up with the ridiculous attempts at humor in this one? I could have used a *lot* less of the stupid wordplay, the foul-mouthed elderly woman on the sidewalk outside the Merteuil-Valmont home, and--most of all--the incredibly offensive and seemingly *endless* parade of ethnic stereotypes among the Merteuil-Valmont servants. Did I miss something? When did mocking people's cultural heritage become funny again?Finally, it was rather annoying to watch a sequel that does little other than repeat situations and phrases from the first one. The opening scene of *2* was a *complete* rip-off of the first one, as was Kathryn's ""befriending"" of classmate Cherie. Outside of those two instances, the movie kept popping up with quotes from the original (""Keep your friends close and your enemies closer,"" ""It's a pity you're not [cute],"" etc.). Can't we move on and be original?I can think of little else to say about this movie. In its meagre defense, I did rather like the ""twist"" at the end (obvious as it was), the fact that they kept the main theme, and the use of the same house. These three things combined, however, still can't bring my rating for this terrible movie higher than a single star. Maybe someone will (hopefully?) make a great *Cruel Intentions 3* that effectively erases this terrible first sequel from the public consciousness.",1,"Ambitious, But That's About It",992217600,"06 11, 2001",2001,2584,"['definitely', 'top', 'two', 'three', 'worst', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'fellow', 'reviewers', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'first', '*Cruel', 'Intentions*', 'was', 'hoping', 'something', 'least', 'somewhat', 'comparable', 'sequel', 'was', '*not*', 'case', 'admit', 'should', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'clued-in', 'cheesy', 'trashy', 'cover', 'art', 'video', 'sleeve', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'still', 'hopeful.Overall', 'acting', 'was', 'awful', 'Robin', 'Dunne', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'were', 'actually', 'best', 'bunch', 'complete', 'lack', 'physical', 'character', 'resemblance', 'first', 'Sebastian', 'soap-opera-esque', 'interpretation', 'Tiffany', 'Merteuil-Valmont', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'was', '*terrible*', 'childish', 'Kathryn', 'Merteuil', 'only', 'apparently', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'seeming', 'be', 'very', 'slight', 'facial', 'resemblance', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Otherwise', 'one', 'moment', 'brilliant', 'evil', 'talented', 'next', 'moment', 'stupid', 'self-conscious', 'clumsy', '*completely*', 'odds', 'original.Most', 'films', 'even', 'darker', 'ones', 'have', 'least', 'comic', 'relief', 'first', '*Cruel', 'Intentions*', 'was', 'exception', 'occasional', 'quip', 'scene', 'retirment', 'home', 'childish', 'dopey', 'character', 'Cecile', 'Caldwell', 'What', 'however', 'was', 'up', 'ridiculous', 'attempts', 'humor', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'used', '*lot*', 'less', 'stupid', 'wordplay', 'foul-mouthed', 'elderly', 'woman', 'sidewalk', 'Merteuil-Valmont', 'home', 'most', 'incredibly', 'offensive', 'seemingly', '*endless*', 'parade', 'ethnic', 'stereotypes', 'Merteuil-Valmont', 'servants', 'Did', 'miss', 'something', 'When', 'did', 'mocking', 'people', 'cultural', 'heritage', 'become', 'funny', 'again', 'Finally', 'was', 'rather', 'annoying', 'watch', 'sequel', 'little', 'other', 'repeat', 'situations', 'phrases', 'first', 'one', 'opening', 'scene', '*2*', 'was', '*complete*', 'rip-off', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'Kathryn', 'befriending', 'classmate', 'Cherie', 'Outside', 'two', 'instances', 'movie', 'kept', 'popping', 'up', 'quotes', 'original', 'Keep', 'friends', 'close', 'enemies', 'closer', 'pity', ""'re"", 'not', '[', 'cute', ']', 'etc.', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'move', 'be', 'original', 'can', 'think', 'little', 'else', 'say', 'movie', 'meagre', 'defense', 'did', 'rather', 'twist', 'end', 'obvious', 'was', 'fact', 'kept', 'main', 'theme', 'use', 'same', 'house', 'three', 'things', 'combined', 'however', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'rating', 'terrible', 'movie', 'higher', 'single', 'star', 'Maybe', 'someone', 'will', 'hopefully', 'make', 'great', '*Cruel', 'Intentions', '3*', 'effectively', 'terrible', 'first', 'sequel', 'public', 'consciousness']",Cruel Intentions 2
557264,A2I2DE1DJUVQOO,B00004XPPI,DarthRad,"[0, 0]","Well, the only reason to watch this rather lackluster rmovie is that this was Amy Adams's first movie as the female lead, and she plays such a totally different character from almost all her other movie roles.  Adams is a star on the rise and has specialized in characters exuding genuine sweetness, charm, and earnestness with roles like Giselle in ""Enchanted"", Susan in ""Talledega Nights"",  Ashley in ""Junebug"" (for which she got an Oscar nomination), and the flamboozled Brenda Strong in ""Catch Me If You Can"".Amy Adams does not particularly shine in this supposed prequel role here as Kathryn Merteuil, the same character played by Sarah Michelle Gellar in the original ""Cruel Intentions"".  Adams  has these big, round, intensely blue eyes,  a huge smile that breaks out easily, and such a soft, sweet voice that no matter how hard she tries, she just can't come across as being a dark and evil character.  Cold, snippy, stuck up, and in the midst of a menstrual cramp is about all that comes through here in this movie.Sarah Michelle Gellar in the first Cruel Intentions did have this dark quality about her with the hint of pure evil that made her version of the character so much richer.Robin Dunne, as the prequel Sebastian Valmont, also is much softer and nicer than Ryan Phillipe's version.There isn't much to this movie, and the problem is the script, which doesn't know where to go with the characters.  Being a prequel, Kathryn and Sebastian presumably would be more innocent than later on.  And their parents would be in the picture also.  And that pretty much limits the plot of the movie.There is the one obligatory gratuitous nude shower scene.  And the funniest part of the movie is the line about girls and horses.  That's about it.",2,Now I know why girls like horses!

As all know by now, CI2 was originally the planned FOX tv show, Manchester Prep, which was spun off from Cruel Intentions. When FOX saw how risky the content was, they decided to not add it to their fall line-up in '99, or any other line-up beyond that. I, myself, was very dissapointed as Cruel Intentions is my top favorite movie of all time. CI2 is basically about how Sebastian Valmont really got into ruining people's lives, a quest that was set by his &quot;psycho stepsister&quot; Kathryn Mertieul. I must say that Amy Adams did a good job portraying Kathryn, but nobody will ever beat Sarah Michelle Gellar at the role. Also, Keri Lynn Platt who plays Cherie did her character and very good was the most hilarious person. CI2 is also a bit more toned up than the original, as in there's more of the nudity business . . . and the grabbing business. But it all fits into the plot, which was also great.

I have memorized every line from that movie and still watch it on a regular basis.  I had heard about MANCHESTER PREP, the TV series based on the movie that got axed before it even aired, and just expected it to go away without a fuss.  Then I heard about CRUEL INTENTIONS 2 and upon further investigation learned that it was the TV series made into a movie.  I rented it, not expecting much, because not ONE person from the original was returning and the cover looked really corny.  I put it in, and in the first five minutes I felt cheated.  It was basically the beginning of CRUEL INTENTIONS set in a principles office with actors no one knows.  This seemed to be the underlying theme of this movie, because every five minutes some character would half heartedly spout out a line that we all heard in the original.  The story line is EXACTLY the same (devirginizing the naive one, and falling in love with the headmasters daughter-sound familiar?) as the CRUEL INTENTIONS plot.  What makes me even madder is, despite the fact they tried to tie in this movie with its precedor, it made no sense when compared.  These were two movies with the same story line that couldnt be less connected if they had two different titles.  Besides making no sense compared to the original, it also makes no sense compared in itself.  The ending for example, was just the writer trying to introduce the element of suprise when really he ended up butchering everything.  It made no sense.  I wouldnt recommend this to the people who starred in it.  They should be ashamed that they bring such shame to the orignal.  And whats most suprising it was written by the same guy.  The acting was bad, as was the chemistry between the actors, the script was worse, and it didnt work in with the orignal.  Stay away from this.

Troubled boy then goes to stay with father who is living with rich wife and  the focla point; rich daughter, Kathryn, who has it and accordingly is it ""all."" Head of the class in popularity, dancing the ditches of demise in seething, she seems bent on making or breaking anyone she chooses.And that seems fine to troubled boy at first, because the new life, it seems like the promise land. Herein, troubled boy is smart enough to try and begin anew, placing everything that he has done on the blank slate called ""bribery"" and forging himself a new ""he."" The only ""snag"" with that is the fact that he thinks that he and Kathryn should find out who is the master of the house. He thinks he should teach her a lesson that she perhaps knows, one on domination, and thus a duel begins.And the game, o the game, that's what its all about.While I can agree with the critics in some ways and say that this movie wasn't original and that it wasn't like the first Cruel Intentions, I do disagree with them regarding how the movie was played out. The reason I say that is because the punchline to the build of everything, the breaking of the shell that was once called dignity in the playground of souls, it is done well.Cruelty, that is the name of the game and, honestly, these people know how to play.From the very beginning, the viewer is thrust into a world where things aren't exactly as they seem. Multiple players are playing games on multiple levels, some not really knowing they are players in the process at all, and nothing is sacred. And the way they go to extremes to destroy one another, all for a little spite, it places a warm spot in a heart that paid money to see some damage being done.Regardless of proposed ""intentions"" by watchers, this movie wasn't geared to teach me a lesson on good triumphing over the vile plots of some manipulative soul, nor was it supposedly going to showcase an arena in which the outcome has already been decided. No, the ending of the movie, by those standards, would leave many people sitting at home and questioning why. And, honestly, that's why I thought it was worth watching. The ""scripting"" of something that happens at the ending, it doesn't produce the same drab results that make everyone wonder why the game was played in the first place. Instead, the bottle produces a little bit of wickedly-spawned lightning, and that is always good for the wandering soul.Perhaps the production ""value"" has decreased and perhaps there is more of the seemingly unlovable aspects that R-rated moviegoers seem to imply that they don't want to see - a girl being driven to the big ""O"" in public by being duped into thinking that the proper way to ride a horse is more stimulating than it should be and (gasp) nudity - but these things happen in the big kid's ballpark. Frankly, its part of the game being played and it makes everything more manipulative - not to mention more meriting in the ratings category. In fact, that's why, in some ways, some of the games had an evil chuckle behind them because, again, nothing is sacred.The only real flaw I found in it was that it ended too soon, cutting off the downward spiral that would have, otherwise, been a delicious spiral to watch descend.",4,Beauty is a Beast,1059609600,"07 31, 2003",2003,3396,"['Troubled', 'boy', 'Sebastian', 'troublesome', 'pranks', 'end', 'more', 'finality', 'seemingly', 'bargained', 'placing', 'hot', 'water', 'making', 'reviewer', 'laugh', 'Troubled', 'boy', 'then', 'stay', 'father', 'who', 'living', 'rich', 'wife', 'focla', 'point', 'rich', 'daughter', 'Kathryn', 'who', 'accordingly', 'Head', 'class', 'popularity', 'dancing', 'ditches', 'demise', 'seething', 'bent', 'making', 'breaking', 'anyone', 'fine', 'troubled', 'boy', 'first', 'new', 'life', 'promise', 'land', 'Herein', 'troubled', 'boy', 'smart', 'enough', 'try', 'begin', 'anew', 'placing', 'everything', 'done', 'blank', 'slate', 'called', 'bribery', 'forging', 'new', 'only', 'snag', 'fact', 'Kathryn', 'should', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'master', 'house', 'should', 'teach', 'lesson', 'perhaps', 'one', 'domination', 'thus', 'duel', 'game', 'o', 'game', 'what', 'can', 'agree', 'critics', 'ways', 'say', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'original', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'Cruel', 'Intentions', 'do', 'disagree', 'regarding', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'played', 'out', 'reason', 'say', 'punchline', 'build', 'everything', 'breaking', 'shell', 'was', 'once', 'called', 'dignity', 'playground', 'souls', 'done', 'well.Cruelty', 'name', 'game', 'honestly', 'people', 'know', 'how', 'play.From', 'very', 'beginning', 'viewer', 'thrust', 'world', 'where', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'seem', 'Multiple', 'players', 'are', 'playing', 'games', 'multiple', 'levels', 'not', 'really', 'knowing', 'are', 'players', 'process', 'nothing', 'sacred', 'way', 'go', 'extremes', 'destroy', 'one', 'little', 'spite', 'warm', 'spot', 'heart', 'paid', 'money', 'see', 'damage', 'being', 'done.Regardless', 'proposed', 'intentions', 'watchers', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'geared', 'teach', 'lesson', 'good', 'triumphing', 'vile', 'plots', 'manipulative', 'soul', 'was', 'supposedly', 'going', 'showcase', 'arena', 'outcome', 'already', 'been', 'decided', 'No', 'ending', 'movie', 'standards', 'would', 'leave', 'many', 'people', 'sitting', 'home', 'questioning', 'why', 'honestly', 'why', 'thought', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'scripting', 'something', 'ending', ""n't"", 'produce', 'same', 'drab', 'results', 'make', 'everyone', 'wonder', 'why', 'game', 'was', 'played', 'first', 'place', 'Instead', 'bottle', 'little', 'bit', 'wickedly-spawned', 'lightning', 'always', 'good', 'wandering', 'production', 'value', 'decreased', 'perhaps', 'more', 'seemingly', 'unlovable', 'aspects', 'R-rated', 'moviegoers', 'seem', 'imply', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'girl', 'being', 'driven', 'big', 'O', 'public', 'being', 'duped', 'thinking', 'proper', 'way', 'ride', 'horse', 'more', 'stimulating', 'should', 'be', 'gasp', 'nudity', 'things', 'happen', 'big', 'kid', 'ballpark', 'Frankly', 'part', 'game', 'being', 'played', 'everything', 'more', 'manipulative', 'not', 'mention', 'more', 'meriting', 'ratings', 'category', 'fact', 'why', 'ways', 'games', 'had', 'evil', 'chuckle', 'because', 'again', 'nothing', 'sacred.The', 'only', 'real', 'flaw', 'found', 'was', 'ended', 'too', 'soon', 'cutting', 'off', 'downward', 'spiral', 'would', 'have', 'otherwise', 'been', 'delicious', 'spiral', 'watch', 'descend']",Cruel Intentions 2
