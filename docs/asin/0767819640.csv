15654,A1KAAVZOHW640S,0767819640,&#34;extreme_dig_cm&#34;,"[1, 1]","I think it's great- it's the most recent of Jackie's films that I truly enjoy watching over & over again.Highlights here for me...- Jackie fixing a rally car as a South African native.- Jackie escaping an interrogation in handcuffs.- White Mitsubishi car chase with 2 beautiful sidekicks.- Every fight & stunt on location in Netherlands' Rotterdam.The film's well-deserved claim to fame is the last, long fight scene atop a stylish-looking skyscraper, where Jackie takes on 2 opponents & then slides down the steep exterior of the building itself (!). This fight choreography & stuntwork is as impressive to me as in Jackie's earlier films. Chan physically does things here that most young actors can only dream about. The various acting performances in this film may be really stiff, but the action scenes are high in quality. And the visual look & design of all the settings & scenes is also reasonably impressive. The entire movie has a pretty big-budget look to it in comparison to Jackie's earlier 80's & early 90's works. Visually-speaking, I easily consider this to be among Jackie's more impressive releases.Interesting tid-bits of information...- Jackie's hotel room in this is 1954, the year of his birth.- This American release has been cut & edited, which I personally don't mind, but it's worth considering.- Originally filmed in early '97, Jackie was just about to turn 43 at the time. The movie was released in 1998.- Two scenes are reminiscent of Jackie's first Project A movie in 1983. In both films, Jackie has to escape bad guys while in handcuffs, and in both films there's a dangerous stunt involving the possibility of falling from an imposing height. In Project A, that would be the famous clock tower stunt.- Somewhat funny use of stunt doubles here on at least 2 occasions throughout the long ending sequence. In the first, Jackie's white opponent during the skyscraper fight is seen briefly from behind sporting a very obvious asian-looking hairstyle. In the second, the female doing the spin kick at the very end of the movie is actually a male stuntman in drag. This is not the first Jackie film to do this so blatantly. I recently noticed the exact same thing while watching Wheels on Meals circa 1984, wherein a white actor who is supposed to be a skilled fencer is briefly replaced with an asian double, with little effort to conceal the switch visually. In every case it's a bit jarring & funny, and it's not really a criticism on my part, just merely an observation.",5,I'm loving it,1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,2499,"['think', 'great-', 'most', 'recent', 'Jackie', 'films', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'again.Highlights', 'here', 'Jackie', 'fixing', 'rally', 'car', 'South', 'African', 'native.-', 'Jackie', 'escaping', 'interrogation', 'handcuffs.-', 'White', 'Mitsubishi', 'car', 'chase', '2', 'beautiful', 'sidekicks.-', 'Every', 'fight', 'stunt', 'location', 'Netherlands', 'Rotterdam.The', 'film', 'well-deserved', 'claim', 'fame', 'last', 'long', 'fight', 'scene', 'stylish-looking', 'skyscraper', 'where', 'Jackie', '2', 'opponents', 'then', 'down', 'steep', 'exterior', 'building', 'fight', 'choreography', 'stuntwork', 'as', 'impressive', 'Jackie', 'earlier', 'films', 'Chan', 'physically', 'things', 'here', 'most', 'young', 'actors', 'can', 'only', 'dream', 'about', 'various', 'acting', 'performances', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'really', 'stiff', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'high', 'quality', 'visual', 'look', 'design', 'settings', 'scenes', 'also', 'reasonably', 'impressive', 'entire', 'movie', 'pretty', 'big-budget', 'look', 'comparison', 'Jackie', 'earlier', '80', 'early', '90', 'works', 'Visually-speaking', 'easily', 'consider', 'be', 'Jackie', 'more', 'impressive', 'releases.Interesting', 'tid-bits', 'information', 'Jackie', 'hotel', 'room', '1954', 'year', 'birth.-', 'American', 'release', 'been', 'cut', 'edited', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'worth', 'considering.-', 'Originally', 'filmed', 'early', ""'97"", 'Jackie', 'was', 'just', 'turn', '43', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '1998.-', 'Two', 'scenes', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'Jackie', 'first', 'Project', 'A', 'movie', '1983', 'films', 'Jackie', 'escape', 'bad', 'guys', 'handcuffs', 'films', 'dangerous', 'stunt', 'involving', 'possibility', 'falling', 'imposing', 'height', 'Project', 'A', 'would', 'be', 'famous', 'clock', 'tower', 'stunt.-', 'Somewhat', 'funny', 'use', 'stunt', 'doubles', 'here', 'least', '2', 'occasions', 'long', 'ending', 'sequence', 'first', 'Jackie', 'white', 'opponent', 'skyscraper', 'fight', 'seen', 'briefly', 'sporting', 'very', 'obvious', 'asian-looking', 'hairstyle', 'second', 'female', 'doing', 'spin', 'kick', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'actually', 'male', 'stuntman', 'drag', 'not', 'first', 'Jackie', 'film', 'do', 'so', 'blatantly', 'recently', 'noticed', 'exact', 'same', 'thing', 'watching', 'Wheels', 'Meals', 'circa', '1984', 'wherein', 'white', 'actor', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'skilled', 'fencer', 'briefly', 'replaced', 'asian', 'double', 'little', 'effort', 'conceal', 'switch', 'visually', 'case', 'bit', 'jarring', 'funny', 'not', 'really', 'criticism', 'part', 'just', 'merely', 'observation']",N/A

The final fight, as has been said before, is a thing you'll want to see again and again. It is amazing.There are some really tell tale signs, that this is a JC movie (apart from the action stuff).

15671,A3QTB346UKG6TV,0767819640,Mantis,"[2, 2]","Probably the last of Chan's great movies, at least in terms of fights and stunts.  Certainly not in plot:  A highly skilled soldier with amnesia?  Chan traveling with two female companions?  Hmm... haven't seen either of those before!  Honestly it doesn't really matter.  This is still Chan doing what Chan does best.  Plus it's always interesting to see a Hong Kong production of an English-language film that takes place in Europe and Africa.  That alone makes it worth a view.Chan plays a soldier who wakes up in Namibia with no memory of who he is or how he got there.  After making some new friends he travels to Johannesburg where he asks the local authorities for help.  Some government goons then show up and take him into custody.  He escapes and journeys to the Netherlands in his continuous pursuit of the truth and ends up facing intrigue, betrayal, and more goons.If you read the back of the case you'd think this was a serious film.  It does take a little while before the comedy kicks in but it's quite frequent once it does.  Fortunately a lot of the humor is stunt-based and there are some good moments.  Unfortunately there aren't very many fights... but the quality of the ones here are top notch.  From fighting while handcuffed to fighting while wearing wooden shoes to an awesome rooftop finale against two opponents who are timing one another to see who can knock Chan down the fastest!The Columbia Tri Star DVD has flipside widescreen or fullscreen picture with very good quality.  English language with a French dub and English or French subtitles.  Sorry, no special features.  The Hong Kong version contains several more minutes of footage and supposedly fills in a couple of the gaps.  It would be cool to see this in its entirety but this version should satisfy most Chan fans for the majority of its 108 minutes.1998",4,a rope and bucket for an escalator?,1240358400,"04 22, 2009",2009,1846,"['Probably', 'last', 'Chan', 'great', 'movies', 'least', 'terms', 'fights', 'stunts', 'Certainly', 'not', 'plot', 'highly', 'skilled', 'soldier', 'amnesia', 'Chan', 'traveling', 'two', 'female', 'companions', 'Hmm', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Honestly', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'still', 'Chan', 'doing', 'what', 'Chan', 'best', 'always', 'interesting', 'see', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'production', 'English-language', 'film', 'place', 'Europe', 'Africa', 'alone', 'view.Chan', 'soldier', 'who', 'up', 'Namibia', 'memory', 'who', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'making', 'new', 'friends', 'Johannesburg', 'where', 'local', 'authorities', 'help', 'government', 'goons', 'then', 'show', 'up', 'take', 'custody', 'journeys', 'Netherlands', 'continuous', 'pursuit', 'truth', 'up', 'facing', 'intrigue', 'betrayal', 'more', 'goons.If', 'read', 'back', 'case', ""'d"", 'think', 'was', 'serious', 'film', 'take', 'little', 'while', 'comedy', 'kicks', 'quite', 'frequent', 'Fortunately', 'lot', 'humor', 'stunt-based', 'are', 'good', 'moments', 'Unfortunately', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'many', 'fights', 'quality', 'ones', 'here', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'fighting', 'handcuffed', 'fighting', 'wearing', 'wooden', 'shoes', 'awesome', 'rooftop', 'finale', 'two', 'opponents', 'who', 'are', 'timing', 'one', 'see', 'who', 'can', 'knock', 'Chan', 'fastest', 'Columbia', 'Tri', 'Star', 'DVD', 'flipside', 'widescreen', 'fullscreen', 'picture', 'very', 'good', 'quality', 'English', 'language', 'French', 'dub', 'English', 'French', 'subtitles', 'Sorry', 'special', 'features', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'version', 'several', 'more', 'minutes', 'footage', 'supposedly', 'fills', 'couple', 'gaps', 'would', 'be', 'cool', 'see', 'entirety', 'version', 'should', 'satisfy', 'most', 'Chan', 'fans', 'majority', '108', 'minutes.1998']",N/A

15673,AE8YLQ8P45GR,0767819640,M.C,"[1, 1]","Jackie Chan's most expensive Hong Kong film was even a direct-to-video movie in the states. It got released on cable tv on SEPTEMBER 11th, 1998. How 'bout that. It should've been a theatrical feature.The movie opens with Jackie as part of a commando team capturing terrorists who are experimenting with a new kind of chemical-based explosive. But  after they've succeded, the commandos superiors betray them, and  crash the chopper. Only Jackie survives (he falls out into some trees before the crash), but awakens with a bad case of near total amnesia. All it seems he can remember is his martial arts training, so he's got to uncover the truth and stop the bad guys before the new bomb gets into the wrong hands.This movie has more plot than most of Jackie's flicks (GORGEOUS, as good as it was, has no more story than a children's lullaby.) This also has MORE kung fu fighting than alot of jackie's other films, and they're all loaded with it. The acting, for the most part, is atrocious, but it doesn't distract for the movies selling-point. The blend of action and comedy, Jackie Chan style, to make a fun action;comedy;martial arts hybrid that works.Fans will enjoy one of Jackie's many trademarks, which is the use of both his martial arts skills as well as any props are in arms reach. During one scene, Jackie has his hands tied behind his back, and he uses a chair to help him ward off his opponents. In another scene, he's had his shoes removed by one guy who wants to just step on his feet and capture him, so he gets ahold of some wooden shoes to use as weapons.Even the final showdown on the top of a skyscraper is uncommonly impressive for a Jackie Chan movie, where he faces not one, but two opponents with the strength and speed to match his. It's a quintessential Jackie Chan action-comedy, sure to please way more than just it's target audience. In closing, I'd just like o point out the scene where Jackie gaives his gun to someone claiming to be an ally, who then puts the gun to Jackie's head and pulls the trigger. It doesn't fire, and for once, it's not because it's out of bullets.",5,"""I might have amnesia, but I'm not stupid!!!""",1055808000,"06 17, 2003",2003,2106,"['Jackie', 'Chan', 'most', 'expensive', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'film', 'was', 'even', 'direct-to-video', 'movie', 'states', 'got', 'released', 'cable', 'tv', 'SEPTEMBER', '11th', '1998', 'How', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'theatrical', 'feature.The', 'movie', 'Jackie', 'part', 'commando', 'team', 'capturing', 'terrorists', 'who', 'are', 'experimenting', 'new', 'kind', 'chemical-based', 'explosive', ""'ve"", 'succeded', 'commandos', 'superiors', 'betray', 'chopper', 'Only', 'Jackie', 'out', 'trees', 'crash', 'bad', 'case', 'total', 'amnesia', 'can', 'remember', 'martial', 'arts', 'training', 'got', 'uncover', 'truth', 'stop', 'bad', 'guys', 'new', 'bomb', 'wrong', 'hands.This', 'movie', 'more', 'plot', 'most', 'Jackie', 'flicks', 'GORGEOUS', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'more', 'story', 'children', 'lullaby', 'also', 'MORE', 'kung', 'fu', 'fighting', 'alot', 'jackie', 'other', 'films', ""'re"", 'loaded', 'acting', 'most', 'part', 'atrocious', ""n't"", 'distract', 'movies', 'selling-point', 'blend', 'action', 'comedy', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'style', 'make', 'fun', 'action', 'comedy', 'martial', 'arts', 'hybrid', 'works.Fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'one', 'Jackie', 'many', 'trademarks', 'use', 'martial', 'arts', 'skills', 'as', 'well', 'props', 'are', 'arms', 'reach', 'one', 'scene', 'Jackie', 'hands', 'tied', 'back', 'chair', 'help', 'ward', 'off', 'opponents', 'scene', 'had', 'shoes', 'removed', 'one', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'step', 'feet', 'capture', 'so', 'ahold', 'wooden', 'shoes', 'use', 'weapons.Even', 'final', 'showdown', 'top', 'skyscraper', 'uncommonly', 'impressive', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'movie', 'where', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'opponents', 'strength', 'speed', 'match', 'quintessential', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'action-comedy', 'sure', 'please', 'way', 'more', 'just', 'target', 'audience', 'closing', ""'d"", 'just', 'like', 'o', 'point', 'out', 'scene', 'where', 'Jackie', 'gun', 'someone', 'claiming', 'be', 'ally', 'who', 'then', 'gun', 'Jackie', 'head', 'trigger', ""n't"", 'fire', 'once', 'not', 'bullets']",N/A

The mission was a success, until one of their superiors double crossed them. The commandos were then killed in a chopper crash, except Jackie who fell out of the chopper. After that, Jackie was picked up by a a tribe of South African Indians, who then asked him his name. Sadly, Jackie had lost his memory and shouted 'Who Am I?!' which led the Indians to think that it was his name. So he started learning their cultures and customs, while also trying to pick up their language. Later, he started having memories of things that happened before the crash, and he decided to leave the Indians in search for his identity. The story in this movie is solid, not much more can be said than that. Chan is excellent in the lead and is a real wonder to watch.  This is a good Chan movie, it's funny, and has some good action scenes and ends with a really good conclusion. Well worth watching.",5,Jackie Chan's Who Am I?,1265500800,"02 7, 2010",2010,1004,"['started', 'when', 'bunch', 'commandos', 'kidnapped', 'three', 'scientist', 'who', 'were', 'studying', 'very', 'powerful', 'meteorite', 'fragments', 'mission', 'was', 'success', 'one', 'superiors', 'double', 'crossed', 'commandos', 'were', 'then', 'killed', 'chopper', 'crash', 'Jackie', 'who', 'fell', 'chopper', 'Jackie', 'was', 'picked', 'up', 'tribe', 'South', 'African', 'Indians', 'who', 'then', 'asked', 'name', 'Sadly', 'Jackie', 'had', 'lost', 'memory', 'shouted', ""'Who"", 'Am', 'led', 'Indians', 'think', 'was', 'name', 'started', 'learning', 'cultures', 'customs', 'also', 'trying', 'pick', 'up', 'language', 'Later', 'started', 'having', 'memories', 'things', 'happened', 'crash', 'decided', 'leave', 'Indians', 'search', 'identity', 'story', 'movie', 'solid', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Chan', 'excellent', 'lead', 'real', 'wonder', 'watch', 'good', 'Chan', 'movie', 'funny', 'good', 'action', 'scenes', 'really', 'good', 'conclusion', 'Well', 'watching']",N/A
