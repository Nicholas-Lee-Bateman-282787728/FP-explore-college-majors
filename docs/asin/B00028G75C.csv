Audio is clear and video has a look similar toO BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?(2000), with a color spectrum skewed toward shades of brown and no vibrant primary colors. As there's a deterioration disclaimer before the main menu, this antique effect is probably unintentional.A limited production budget has advantages and drawbacks. On the plus side, unnecessary digressions are eliminated. Case in point: no plot-stopping inaugural ball footage. To the negative: battle reenactments that, due to a small number of participants, barely rise beyond the level of skirmishes. The many insertions of stock footage in war sequences is obvious, as these flown-in scenes lack sharpness of focus. The film is not primarily about these clashes of arms, so such limitations are not ruinous, just noticeable. Not having Abe's personal assistant John Nicolay in the story however while John Hay is extensively featured is a curious choice of economizing.The movie opens and closes with the modified lyrics version of Woody Guthrie's ""This Train is Bound For Glory"" over the beginning scene, a train arriving in Baltimore and at the end, while it bears away from Washington the martyred president's remains. In-between, the story of Abraham and Mary Lincoln is deftly scripted and capably served by stars Waterston and Moore.Both are presented with human failings. Lincoln occasionally lashes out at subordinates when flustered or his sensibilities are insulted by them, but mostly he's mild and affable. Mary is more complex, a woman with many grudges and few friends, possibly manic-depressive, her spendthrift bursts place a tremendous financial burden on a husband already heavily laden with preserving the Union. To finance her impulsive buying sprees, Mary leaks information to the press for a price and more egregiously, commits fraud by collecting the salary of a deceased White House employee.Those familiar with Lincoln's part in the Civil War will be pleased by the historical accuracy of this presentation. A supporting cast of familiar faces adds to the enjoyment. Highly recommended to all aficonados of costume drama and 19th Century American history.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(7.0) Lincoln (TV-1988) - Sam Waterston/Mary Tyler Moore/Richard Mulligan/Gregory Cooke/Steven Culp/Ruby Dee/James Gammon/Cleavon Little/John Houseman",4,"Abraham Lincoln: ""There is nothing more like eternity than a train ride of eleven days, unless it's two people and a ham.""",1360713600,"02 13, 2013",2013,2567,"['other', 'ECHO', 'BRIDGE/PLATINUM', 'DISC', 'products', 'Civil', 'War', 'era', 'costumer', ""n't"", 'have', 'distracting', 'on-screen', 'company', 'logo.Gore', 'Vidal', 'LINCOLN', 'full', '3-plus', 'hour', 'made-for-TV', 'minseries', 'Audio', 'clear', 'video', 'look', 'similar', 'toO', 'BROTHER', 'WHERE', 'ART', 'THOU', '2000', 'color', 'spectrum', 'skewed', 'shades', 'brown', 'vibrant', 'primary', 'colors', 'deterioration', 'disclaimer', 'main', 'menu', 'antique', 'effect', 'probably', 'unintentional.A', 'limited', 'production', 'budget', 'advantages', 'drawbacks', 'plus', 'side', 'unnecessary', 'digressions', 'are', 'eliminated', 'Case', 'point', 'plot-stopping', 'inaugural', 'ball', 'footage', 'negative', 'battle', 'reenactments', 'due', 'small', 'number', 'participants', 'barely', 'rise', 'level', 'skirmishes', 'many', 'insertions', 'stock', 'footage', 'war', 'sequences', 'obvious', 'flown-in', 'scenes', 'lack', 'sharpness', 'focus', 'film', 'not', 'primarily', 'clashes', 'arms', 'such', 'limitations', 'are', 'not', 'ruinous', 'just', 'noticeable', 'Not', 'having', 'Abe', 'personal', 'assistant', 'John', 'Nicolay', 'story', 'however', 'John', 'Hay', 'extensively', 'featured', 'curious', 'choice', 'economizing.The', 'movie', 'opens', 'closes', 'modified', 'lyrics', 'version', 'Woody', 'Guthrie', 'Train', 'Bound', 'Glory', 'beginning', 'scene', 'train', 'arriving', 'Baltimore', 'end', 'away', 'Washington', 'martyred', 'president', 'remains', 'In-between', 'story', 'Abraham', 'Mary', 'Lincoln', 'deftly', 'scripted', 'capably', 'served', 'stars', 'Waterston', 'Moore.Both', 'are', 'presented', 'human', 'failings', 'Lincoln', 'occasionally', 'out', 'subordinates', 'when', 'flustered', 'sensibilities', 'are', 'insulted', 'mostly', 'mild', 'affable', 'Mary', 'more', 'complex', 'woman', 'many', 'grudges', 'few', 'friends', 'possibly', 'manic-depressive', 'spendthrift', 'bursts', 'place', 'tremendous', 'financial', 'burden', 'husband', 'already', 'heavily', 'laden', 'preserving', 'Union', 'finance', 'impulsive', 'buying', 'sprees', 'Mary', 'information', 'press', 'price', 'more', 'egregiously', 'commits', 'fraud', 'collecting', 'salary', 'deceased', 'White', 'House', 'employee.Those', 'familiar', 'Lincoln', 'part', 'Civil', 'War', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'presentation', 'supporting', 'cast', 'familiar', 'enjoyment', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'aficonados', 'costume', 'drama', '19th', 'Century', 'American', 'history.Parenthetical', 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'IMDb', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', '7.0', 'Lincoln', 'TV-1988', 'Sam', 'Waterston/Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore/Richard', 'Mulligan/Gregory', 'Cooke/Steven', 'Culp/Ruby', 'Dee/James', 'Gammon/Cleavon', 'Little/John', 'Houseman']",Gore Vidal's Lincoln

The script was sensitive to the fact that his wife was fragile or mentally unstable. Other books and movies have, I believe, treated her unfairly. The personal story was interwoven along with politics and war, as it happened, rather than treating each independently. Lincoln didn't have the luxury of stopping his work to be with his wife when she was in crisis. He had to continue his work through personal tragedy as well in the death of his son.Even though our world has changed dramatically, the story shows just how much still remains the same.The actors were believable. I particularly enjoyed the ""younger"" presentation of Lincoln. He is usually represented as looking older than he really was.

827062,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B00028G75C,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[0, 0]","Unlike Steven Spielberg's recent film, LINCOLN (1988) refuses to hero-worship its protagonist.  As portrayed by Sam Waterson, he comes across as a ruthlessly determined character prepared to go to any lengths to ensure victory in the Civil War.  He is well aware of the necessity for political deals, in which ethics play little or no part; but he manages these deals with aplomb.  At the same time Waterson's Lincoln remains a tortured soul; someone who understands how his lifelong commitment to politics means that he neglects his family.  He considers himself wholly responsible for his wife Molly's (Mary Tyler Moore's) mental difficulties, that have to be hushed up in the interests of political expediency.As we might expect from Gore Vidal, the focus of this miniseries is less on Abolition and more on the grimy day-to-day realities of American politics, in which friendship and loyalty count for little. Lincoln's rivals, notably Seward (Richard Mulligan) are portrayed as self-interested and rapacious, perpetually ready to put themselves above the national interest.  Hence it comes as no surprise to find that Lincoln understands the frailties of his position: anyone could assassinate him at any time. However Vidal makes it clear that individuals have to negotiate their position in history in the best way they can; it is to Lincoln's eternal credit that he achieved this task, even at the cost of his life.This three-hour long series has its longueurs (the use of shot-reverse-shot sequences becomes irritating after a while), but is redeemed by convincing performances and an intelligent script.",4,A Warts-and-All Portrayal of an American Icon,1362960000,"03 11, 2013",2013,1613,"['Steven', 'Spielberg', 'recent', 'film', 'LINCOLN', '1988', 'hero-worship', 'protagonist', 'portrayed', 'Sam', 'Waterson', 'across', 'ruthlessly', 'determined', 'character', 'prepared', 'go', 'lengths', 'ensure', 'victory', 'Civil', 'War', 'well', 'aware', 'necessity', 'political', 'deals', 'ethics', 'play', 'little', 'part', 'deals', 'aplomb', 'same', 'time', 'Waterson', 'Lincoln', 'tortured', 'soul', 'someone', 'who', 'how', 'lifelong', 'commitment', 'politics', 'family', 'wholly', 'responsible', 'wife', 'Molly', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'mental', 'difficulties', 'have', 'be', 'hushed', 'up', 'interests', 'political', 'expediency.As', 'might', 'expect', 'Gore', 'Vidal', 'focus', 'miniseries', 'less', 'Abolition', 'more', 'grimy', 'day-to-day', 'realities', 'American', 'politics', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'count', 'little', 'Lincoln', 'rivals', 'notably', 'Seward', 'Richard', 'Mulligan', 'are', 'portrayed', 'self-interested', 'rapacious', 'perpetually', 'ready', 'put', 'national', 'interest', 'Hence', 'surprise', 'find', 'Lincoln', 'frailties', 'position', 'anyone', 'could', 'assassinate', 'time', 'However', 'Vidal', 'clear', 'individuals', 'have', 'negotiate', 'position', 'history', 'best', 'way', 'can', 'Lincoln', 'eternal', 'credit', 'achieved', 'task', 'even', 'cost', 'life.This', 'three-hour', 'long', 'series', 'longueurs', 'use', 'shot-reverse-shot', 'sequences', 'irritating', 'while', 'redeemed', 'convincing', 'performances', 'intelligent', 'script']",Gore Vidal's Lincoln

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[5, 5]","[Edited a bit from my original review of June 29, 2004]:Though made drearily for television, based on Gore Vidal's novel, this film has a number of elements that make it ahead of its time. Sam Waterston's savvy, almost hippie-like Lincoln is not at all the ""great ape"" that many of Lincoln's detractors claimed. He is like the true Abraham Lincoln.With the high-pitched Kentucky squeak in his voice (just like Lincoln's, so the history books tell us), Waterston is simply riveting - as Lincoln himself must have been. His terrible screech of pain during the height of the Civil War is something I had always imagined he did several times. Waterston hypnotizes with this Emmy-worthy portrayal.The facts in the film are blurry at times, the direction is plodding, the lighting is too dark - and Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Todd Lincoln must be the casting blunder of the 20th century. Yet all involved give terrific performances. Too bad there wasn't more LINCOLN to this ""Lincoln"". I'd have liked to see his youth in Illinois and his rise to Congress.Richard Mulligan made a spectacular job of Secretary of the Treasury Seward, and the other actors, mostly bit-players, were also very good. The pace is soothing, the sets are good (sad locations and a lack of budget really strangled this).During his campaign for Congress, Lincoln sat in - for fun - on an old Christian 'tent revival'. The preacher, screeching his most fiery sermon, asked Lincoln directly, ""Sir, are you bound for Heaven?!""Lincoln answered, ""If it's all the same to you, sir, I am bound for Congress."" Vintage Lincoln, and Waterston-by-way-of-Vidal conveys that like no one else ever could.All in all, it is the must-see for any interested viewer.",4,"A Shining Lincoln Shows Tarnish, Too",1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,1712,"['[', 'Edited', 'bit', 'original', 'review', 'June', '29', '2004', ']', 'made', 'drearily', 'television', 'based', 'Gore', 'Vidal', 'novel', 'film', 'number', 'elements', 'make', 'ahead', 'time', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'savvy', 'almost', 'hippie-like', 'Lincoln', 'not', 'great', 'ape', 'many', 'Lincoln', 'detractors', 'claimed', 'true', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln.With', 'high-pitched', 'Kentucky', 'squeak', 'voice', 'just', 'Lincoln', 'history', 'books', 'tell', 'Waterston', 'simply', 'riveting', 'Lincoln', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'terrible', 'screech', 'pain', 'height', 'Civil', 'War', 'something', 'had', 'always', 'imagined', 'did', 'several', 'times', 'Waterston', 'Emmy-worthy', 'portrayal.The', 'facts', 'film', 'are', 'blurry', 'times', 'direction', 'plodding', 'lighting', 'too', 'dark', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'Lincoln', 'must', 'be', 'casting', 'blunder', '20th', 'century', 'involved', 'give', 'terrific', 'performances', 'Too', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'LINCOLN', 'Lincoln', ""'d"", 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'youth', 'Illinois', 'rise', 'Congress.Richard', 'Mulligan', 'made', 'spectacular', 'job', 'Secretary', 'Treasury', 'Seward', 'other', 'actors', 'mostly', 'bit-players', 'were', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'pace', 'soothing', 'sets', 'are', 'good', 'sad', 'locations', 'lack', 'budget', 'really', 'strangled', '.During', 'campaign', 'Congress', 'Lincoln', 'sat', 'fun', 'old', 'Christian', ""'tent"", 'revival', 'preacher', 'screeching', 'most', 'fiery', 'sermon', 'asked', 'Lincoln', 'directly', 'Sir', 'are', 'Heaven', 'Lincoln', 'answered', 'same', 'sir', 'am', 'bound', 'Congress', 'Vintage', 'Lincoln', 'Waterston-by-way-of-Vidal', 'conveys', 'one', 'else', 'ever', 'could.All', 'must-see', 'interested', 'viewer']",Gore Vidal's Lincoln

It includes most of the main characters and events from Vidal's book, which covers Lincoln's administrations and his family life, and I thought all of the actors did very good jobs, even Mary Tyler Moore. I assumed she was badly miscast but she turns in a riveting performance as the very messed up Mary Todd Lincoln. I thought Sam Waterston captured Lincoln's wiliness and wisdom and pain really well. The few times this Lincoln loses his cool are really jolting.This TV movie is 3 hours long but I thought the script moved briskly forward. Unlike Spielberg's ""Lincoln,"" which was peopled with too many characters who were barely identified, this miniseries focused on the central players in Lincoln's administration like Seward and Chase, Chase's ambitious daughter Kate, Generals McClellan and Grant, and Lincoln's steadfast secretary, John Hay. The story and characters seemed to be laid out more clearly. Even though it covers a longer period of time and more events than Spielberg's ""Lincoln,"" it seemed more tightly structured to me.I can see why folks with great home movie set-ups would be disappointed with its visual and sound quality. The transfer is a little muddy and it is not in the widescreen format we've all grown accustomed to. But, hey, it's a 1988 TV production and it's only $5! I couldn't tell whether the production's color was washed out because of the bad transfer or because it was intentionally shot through some sepia-toned lens.

827067,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B00028G75C,James Hiller,"[23, 26]","Much of Abraham Lincoln's life has been accounted for and reaccounted for a thousand times over. The facts play around in our minds, much without emotional anchors to hold them down. Prolific and outspoken writer Gore vidal penned a ""fictional"" account of Lincoln in his marvelous book, which a few years later, adapted into a made-for-TV movie. The result, then as now, is an intriguing insights into the personality of the Lincoln family.The movie starts with Lincoln slinking into Washington DC, for fear of a secessionist uprising in Balitmore, under disguise, for which he was much aligned. Constrasted with Mary's arrival, with hoopla and a thousand suitcases, shows the underlying dichotomy in the famous first couple. Jumping from historical event to historical event, the drama digs a bit deeper into the effects of the events on the family. By the time you've finished the movie, you felt like you've not only have a deeper understanding of the Civil War, but of the Lincolns as well.Sam Waterson nails, absolutely nails, Lincoln. We see all sides of him. It must have been a daunting role to play. We have solely deified Lincoln, almost erasing his humanity. Waterson brings it back in full force, with all the humor and sadness needed. At first, hearing that Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Todd Lincoln seems like a joke. Who would ever thought that Mary Richards could play someone Hay and Nicolette called ""Hell Cat?"". But she does. Her decent into madness at the death of Willie is heartbreaking. Richard Mulligan's performance as Sweard is canny, and the ever stalwart Ruby Dee plays Mary Lincoln's dressmaker Mrs. Keckley with all of the sassiness and care required.I rated this movie four stars, not for content or for acting, but for the DVD transfer.

Distilling  nearly 700 pages of biographical detail into a three hour miniseries must have been daunting, but writer Ernest Kinoy was up to the task. It's hard to judge direction in a piece that's divided for commercial breaks, but under the hand of Lamont Johnson, the story remains cohesive. Casting Sam Waterston in the title role was a stroke of genius. Squint a bit, and you could be convinced he was Lincoln, lthough a surprisingly unwrinkled and unworn one. Waterston's Lincoln is fully human, down to high pitched, twangy quality of Lincoln's voice; he has turned in the most credible movie portrayal to date.  Most of the supporting cast was also outstanding, with the singular exception of Mary Tyler Moore. Thin to the point of gauntness, and rigid in her self control, MTM was the visual antithesis of the real Mary Lincoln, who was short, heavy set, and given to unforgettable displays of  temper and hysteria.

It is the best portrayal I have ever seen of Lincoln on the screen and quite faithful to the original novel by Gore Vidal.  You feel Lincoln's sense of purpose, his ability to read people and manipulate them in accordance with it, and his emotional life.  It is subtle, at times shocking, but always engaging.The viewer also gets a good glance at the major events of the Civil War in outline, in just about enough detail for the casual viewer:  the suspension of Habeas Corpus in Maryland, the stodgy Union Generals, the important battles, the human toll.  It is all bound with Lincoln's political purpose, to save the Union at any cost, and stimulates the appetite for more.  It covers Lincoln's difficult relationship with the notorious popinjay McClellan, the deterioration of Mary Todd Lincoln (I did not like Mary Tyler Moore much in the role), and the tensions within the cabinet.  The gravelly Ulysses Grant is also excellent.That being said, it was impossible to get all the nuance of Vidal's novel (his finest by far) into 3 hours.  You get allusions to the themes, but cannot experience such things as the deep conversion of Seward from a scornful enemy to devoted friend, the love of John Hay for the exploited Kate Chase, or Linclon's shrewd maneuverings around the power-hungry Salmon P. Chase.  If you liked the film, you should definitely read the book.

Sam Watterson is dead on with the Lincoln of Gore Vidal's fine novel, and Mary Tyler Moore's Mrs. Lincoln is perfect.  I was amazed that this sitcom actress could be this good.  She deserved an academy award.My only quibble is when snippets of battle were shown.  The movie would have been better without them.  Re-enactors were used, and re-enactors are always too old, too fat, too clean, and too self-conscious.  All one has to do is look at actual photos of Civil War soldiers in the field to prove the point.  And the battle scenes were inaccurate in other ways.  For example, the Confederates did not fire from behind a wooden fence at Fredericksburg, but from a sunken road and a stone wall.  At this same battle in the film we see trees in leaf, whereas the battle was in mid-December, and there was snow on the ground.That aside, this is a fine piece of work, and even though the viewer knows how it ends, there is the sadness of a great tragedy.",5,Best Civil War movie,1243036800,"05 23, 2009",2009,1074,"['thinking', 'best', 'Civil', 'War', 'movie', 'ever', 'more', 'accurate', 'portrait', 'Lincoln', 'films', 'have', 'shown', 'Sam', 'Watterson', 'dead', 'Lincoln', 'Gore', 'Vidal', 'fine', 'novel', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Mrs.', 'Lincoln', 'perfect', 'was', 'amazed', 'sitcom', 'actress', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'deserved', 'academy', 'award.My', 'only', 'quibble', 'when', 'snippets', 'battle', 'were', 'shown', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Re-enactors', 'were', 'used', 're-enactors', 'are', 'always', 'too', 'old', 'too', 'fat', 'too', 'clean', 'too', 'self-conscious', 'one', 'do', 'look', 'actual', 'photos', 'Civil', 'War', 'soldiers', 'field', 'prove', 'point', 'battle', 'scenes', 'were', 'inaccurate', 'other', 'ways', 'example', 'Confederates', 'did', 'not', 'fire', 'wooden', 'fence', 'Fredericksburg', 'sunken', 'road', 'stone', 'wall', 'same', 'battle', 'film', 'see', 'trees', 'leaf', 'battle', 'was', 'mid-December', 'there', 'was', 'snow', 'ground.That', 'aside', 'fine', 'piece', 'work', 'even', 'viewer', 'how', 'sadness', 'great', 'tragedy']",Gore Vidal's Lincoln
827085,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,B00028G75C,Steven Hancock,"[6, 6]","Gore Vidal's ""Lincoln"" presents, quite possibly, the most accurate depiction of Lincoln on film. Unlike previous films, this one shows that Lincoln did not become ""the Great Emancipator"" overnight; rather, his views on the issue of slavery and emancipation, and ultimately having colored troops enlisted, changed over the course of the four years of the American Civil War, and this film does a great job of showing these changing views.While the film is not the best written, the flaws in the script are made up for by strong production values and, most importantly, terrific performances. Sam Waterston gives what is possibly the best performance as Lincoln on film, showing his humor, as well as his darker sides, and the sadness at the loss of a son. While the very beautiful Mary Tyler Moore doesn't look like the short, rather pudgy Mary Todd Lincoln, her performance is well-nuanced, showing both the tenderness and the slight insanity that she was believed to have. The supporting cast is very good, and the depictions of some of the battles, while not always accurate, bring a little excitement to this historical drama.While the DVD doesn't present the best picture quality, the power of the program itself more than makes up for it. As an avid student of Civil War history, I found Gore Vidal's ""Lincoln"" to be as definitive a depiction of our Sixteenth President as has been produced, and I recommend it both to historians and those who enjoy great drama.Movie/DVD Grade: A-",5,"""With malice toward none, with charity for all...""",1234915200,"02 18, 2009",2009,1486,"['Gore', 'Vidal', 'Lincoln', 'presents', 'quite', 'possibly', 'most', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'Lincoln', 'film', 'previous', 'films', 'one', 'Lincoln', 'did', 'not', 'become', 'Great', 'Emancipator', 'overnight', 'rather', 'views', 'issue', 'slavery', 'emancipation', 'ultimately', 'having', 'colored', 'troops', 'enlisted', 'changed', 'course', 'four', 'years', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'changing', 'film', 'not', 'best', 'written', 'flaws', 'script', 'are', 'made', 'up', 'strong', 'production', 'values', 'most', 'importantly', 'terrific', 'performances', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'what', 'possibly', 'best', 'performance', 'Lincoln', 'film', 'showing', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'darker', 'sides', 'sadness', 'loss', 'son', 'very', 'beautiful', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', ""n't"", 'look', 'short', 'rather', 'pudgy', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'Lincoln', 'performance', 'well-nuanced', 'showing', 'tenderness', 'slight', 'insanity', 'was', 'believed', 'have', 'supporting', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'depictions', 'battles', 'not', 'always', 'accurate', 'bring', 'little', 'excitement', 'historical', 'drama.While', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'present', 'best', 'picture', 'quality', 'power', 'program', 'more', 'up', 'avid', 'student', 'Civil', 'War', 'history', 'found', 'Gore', 'Vidal', 'Lincoln', 'be', 'definitive', 'depiction', 'Sixteenth', 'President', 'been', 'produced', 'recommend', 'historians', 'who', 'enjoy', 'great', 'drama.Movie/DVD', 'Grade', 'A-']",Gore Vidal's Lincoln

I don't know if that's true, and I don't a thing about 'Echo Bridge Entertainment"", but they certainly did a huge disservice to a wonderful film that I remembered so fondly (until I purchased this DVD..). First of all, it's not anamporphic (odd, since it was filmed for TV), and the print is so faded as to be almost indistinct at times (you would have thought that it was made in 1938 instead of 1988). Either the transfer is a pirate or the producers hired some junior high schoolers (high schoolers would have done a better job) to use this film as their first editing/film transfer project in preparation for film school (don't show 'em this film, kids, you'll never be admitted!). In any event, the film is still a faithful adapation of Gore Vidal's wonderful novel, Mary Tyler Moore is extraordinary as M.T. Lincoln, Waterson compliments Vidal's vision of Lincoln, and rest of the cast in uniformally excellent. It would be nice to think that on this, the 150 anniversary of the start of the Civil War, some enterprising production company would reedit, remaster, and re-release this excellent and important film.",3,Wonderful film & acting but hideous transfer!,1302912000,"04 16, 2011",2011,1209,"['have', 'share', 'reviewer', 'comments', 'thought', 'DVD', 'edition', 'pirated', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'true', 'do', ""n't"", 'thing', ""'Echo"", 'Bridge', 'Entertainment', 'certainly', 'did', 'huge', 'disservice', 'wonderful', 'film', 'remembered', 'so', 'fondly', 'purchased', 'DVD..', 'First', 'all', 'not', 'anamporphic', 'odd', 'was', 'filmed', 'TV', 'print', 'so', 'faded', 'be', 'almost', 'indistinct', 'times', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'was', 'made', '1938', 'instead', '1988', 'transfer', 'pirate', 'producers', 'hired', 'junior', 'high', 'schoolers', 'high', 'schoolers', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'use', 'film', 'first', 'editing/film', 'transfer', 'project', 'preparation', 'film', 'school', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', ""'em"", 'film', 'kids', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'admitted', 'event', 'film', 'still', 'faithful', 'adapation', 'Gore', 'Vidal', 'wonderful', 'novel', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'extraordinary', 'M.T', 'Lincoln', 'Waterson', 'Vidal', 'vision', 'Lincoln', 'rest', 'cast', 'uniformally', 'excellent', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'think', '150', 'anniversary', 'start', 'Civil', 'War', 'enterprising', 'production', 'company', 'would', 'reedit', 'remaster', 're-release', 'excellent', 'important', 'film']",Gore Vidal's Lincoln
