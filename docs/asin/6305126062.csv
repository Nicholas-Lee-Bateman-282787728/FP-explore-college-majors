Much of the character development, sub-themes, plot sequence and even dialogue is thinly disguised rehash of Redford's earlier movie ""The Electric Horseman"". ""TEH"" was good, or at least Fun, because it was fresh. But repackaging a lot of it to make ""The Horse Whisperer"" turned it into refried beans. ""Whisperer"" is even worse because quite a bit of the main plot simply defies all credibility. The supposed epiphaney of the unconvincing ""family' is so hokey and disingenious it should have somehow been filmed in crayon, not Technicolor. It did as well as it did at the box office for only four reasons. It had a large promotional budget, it had Redford's name attached, it had the word ""horse"" in the title, and there are plenty of garage sale addicts here. Get ""City Slickers"" instead.

449959,AK6UVFSU07NXH,6305126062,Anthony Hinde,"[89, 94]","The Horse Whisperer is not a typical Hollywood movie. But then, none of the films Redford has directed, are in any way typical. The first time I really took notice of his work, was after seeing &quot;A River Runs Through  It&quot;. He had managed to tell a brutal, sad story in a mystical way that  held me spell-bound.Whisperer takes that feeling one step  further. It will hold you and then squeeze your heart till the tears come.  This is not a sad film however. It is the story of a spiritual journey that  a family makes with the aid of a talented guide, Tom Booker, (played by  Redford himself). Each of them takes their own paths but make it through  some trying times, emerging stronger than when they began.The  story gets going as a result of a terrible accident involving two young  girls who are out riding in icy, lightly forested terrain. The lone  survivor, Grace, is traumatised by the loss of her friend, her foot and, in  another way, her horse Pilgrim. Not that Pilgrim was killed, despite the  wishes of the local veterinarian, but it was not the same, sane horse that  it had been.The normal tensions that existed within the family  are magnified by the aftermath of the accident. Grace becomes withdrawn,  suffering guilt and shame which show themselves in her bitterness toward  her parents, Annie and Robert. At the same time she makes a connection  between herself and Pilgrim. The horse's fate seems to be a grim portent of  her own future; scarred, maddened and kept in a dark and lonely place.Annie's desperate search for a treatment for Pilgrim is therefore  very understandable. She hopes to build a bridge back to the world for her  daughter, by healing Pilgrim. Here enters the almost magical legend of the  Horse Whisperers. A breed of men, so in tune with horses, that they are  said to be able to talk with them... to look into the soul of the beast and  calm its raging spirit.Tom Booker seems to have a healthy  scepticism for the legend however and makes his down to earth philosophy  pretty clear from the first moment when we hear him say, &quot; Well truth  is, I help horses with people problems.&quot;Despite Tom and  Robert's reluctance, Annie drags Grace from her pit of despair, to cross  the country on the slim hope of making everything right again, on a Montana  ranch, with a little help from a horse whisperer. Her expectation are  rudely shattered within hours of arriving. Tom doesn't act like a paid  specialist. From the outset it is clear to him that young Grace needs as  much healing as Pilgrim. And this is a load he seems more than capable of  bearing.By now we are well and truly hooked by the story. But the  best is yet to come. Redford clearly loves the great outdoors and his  feeling shouts from the big screen. Montana must be God's own country  because it is breathtaking. Now add a dash of wholesome family values, good  old hard work, reluctant romance and a pinch of equine shamanism and you've  got something special.The Horse Whisperer is a movie that makes  you feel like dozing in the long grass, on a lazy Summer afternoon. Don't  be afraid of grass stains; go see this unusual film and have a roll in the  grass for me.",4,"Heals the heart, strengthens the spirit.",957657600,"05 7, 2000",2000,3196,"['Horse', 'Whisperer', 'not', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'then', 'none', 'films', 'Redford', 'directed', 'are', 'way', 'typical', 'first', 'time', 'really', 'took', 'notice', 'work', 'was', 'seeing', 'quot', 'A', 'River', 'Runs', 'quot', 'had', 'managed', 'tell', 'brutal', 'sad', 'story', 'mystical', 'way', 'held', 'spell-bound.Whisperer', 'feeling', 'one', 'step', 'further', 'will', 'hold', 'then', 'squeeze', 'heart', 'tears', 'come', 'not', 'sad', 'film', 'however', 'story', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'family', 'aid', 'talented', 'guide', 'Tom', 'Booker', 'played', 'Redford', 'own', 'paths', 'make', 'trying', 'times', 'emerging', 'stronger', 'when', 'began.The', 'story', 'going', 'result', 'terrible', 'accident', 'involving', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'out', 'riding', 'icy', 'lightly', 'forested', 'terrain', 'lone', 'survivor', 'Grace', 'traumatised', 'loss', 'friend', 'foot', 'way', 'horse', 'Pilgrim', 'Not', 'Pilgrim', 'was', 'killed', 'wishes', 'local', 'veterinarian', 'was', 'not', 'same', 'sane', 'horse', 'had', 'been.The', 'normal', 'tensions', 'existed', 'family', 'are', 'magnified', 'aftermath', 'accident', 'Grace', 'withdrawn', 'suffering', 'guilt', 'shame', 'show', 'bitterness', 'parents', 'Annie', 'Robert', 'same', 'time', 'connection', 'herself', 'Pilgrim', 'horse', 'fate', 'be', 'grim', 'portent', 'own', 'future', 'scarred', 'maddened', 'kept', 'dark', 'lonely', 'place.Annie', 'desperate', 'search', 'treatment', 'Pilgrim', 'therefore', 'very', 'understandable', 'build', 'bridge', 'back', 'world', 'daughter', 'healing', 'Pilgrim', 'Here', 'almost', 'magical', 'legend', 'Horse', 'Whisperers', 'A', 'breed', 'men', 'so', 'tune', 'horses', 'are', 'said', 'be', 'able', 'talk', 'look', 'soul', 'beast', 'calm', 'raging', 'spirit.Tom', 'Booker', 'have', 'healthy', 'scepticism', 'legend', 'however', 'down', 'earth', 'philosophy', 'pretty', 'clear', 'first', 'moment', 'when', 'hear', 'say', 'quot', 'Well', 'truth', 'help', 'horses', 'people', 'problems.', 'quot', 'Tom', 'Robert', 'reluctance', 'Annie', 'Grace', 'pit', 'despair', 'cross', 'country', 'slim', 'hope', 'making', 'everything', 'right', 'again', 'Montana', 'ranch', 'little', 'help', 'horse', 'whisperer', 'expectation', 'are', 'rudely', 'shattered', 'hours', 'arriving', 'Tom', ""n't"", 'act', 'paid', 'specialist', 'outset', 'clear', 'young', 'Grace', 'much', 'healing', 'Pilgrim', 'load', 'more', 'capable', 'bearing.By', 'now', 'are', 'well', 'truly', 'hooked', 'story', 'best', 'yet', 'come', 'Redford', 'clearly', 'great', 'outdoors', 'feeling', 'shouts', 'big', 'screen', 'Montana', 'must', 'be', 'God', 'own', 'country', 'breathtaking', 'Now', 'dash', 'wholesome', 'family', 'values', 'good', 'old', 'hard', 'work', 'reluctant', 'romance', 'pinch', 'equine', 'shamanism', ""'ve"", 'got', 'something', 'special.The', 'Horse', 'Whisperer', 'movie', 'feel', 'dozing', 'long', 'grass', 'lazy', 'Summer', 'afternoon', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'afraid', 'grass', 'stains', 'go', 'see', 'unusual', 'film', 'have', 'roll', 'grass']",N/A

There is so much more to this film than I've seen anyone write.  Sure it's a romance, horse, child loving horse, injured child (mentally and physically), horsey guy, etc. and whatever else you've read about this movie.  But what I'll attempt to write here is what you're not going to see anywhere else.My personal favorite dynamic in human to human or human to animal relationships is the garnering of trust. And someone, or both, having that intuition to be such that they earn that trust. This is what you have in this movie.  Some spoilers may be involved here...Kristen Scott Thomas' character is ill - on the fast track professionally and away from a quality marriage.  Some might call that success and indeed her character was so caught up in her life that she probably thought she was doing fine. Scarlette Johannson's character is ill as well - both physically and mentally from the accident and from a lack of true connection to her parents, especially her mother. The horse is, well, broken - physically, of course, but traumatized from the accident.These three come to beautiful, clean and pristine (but not over-the-top gorgeous - as I've heard Redford say that he wanted the landscape to speak for itself -intrinsic beauty - not from the photography making it beautiful - paraphrased here) country and they meet Robert Redford's character. He is so peacefully understanding of what these other three are about - he takes stock of the mother (all New York of her), the horse (traumatized) and the girl (resistent and hurting).  He presents himself in such a way that he is totally non-threatening and they all, on their own levels, come to trust him...and they heal.It is a movie about trust. There are prices to pay for that trust, for sure. Redford's character opens up in a way he never thought he would again but I like how this director ended the movie rather than how the book ended.  The book ending made no sense in the context of who the character was so I appreciate that Redford changed it. The mother pays a price for sure....the horse and the girl...well, they're healed and all is right with their world..There are many levels on which to watch this movie - the photography is gorgeous, the horses, the way of life - all beautiful....the music, well, gorgeous and grandiose in parts....the characters multi-level....The husband (Sam Neill)is intelligent and shows he has a good understanding of how his marriage is and the changes his wife has gone through while with Redford. It's a tear-jerker for sure - I don't think as many times as I've watched this movie, that I haven't been crying at the end.

There's nothing fun about seeing an emotionally and physically wounded animal struggling to adjust and to deal.  I've never been big on horses but it breaks my heart to see it on film.  Same can be said about the character Grace, the way she had to deal with being a teenager and an amputee at the same time.  It's a lot for either of them to handle.  The emotional roughness portrayed by them in a parallel way was very hard to take while watching it.As for the ending, if you really listened to Sam Neil's speech to Miss Scott Thomas (his wife in the movie), you'd realize why she makes the decision she made.  It's not an easy task for a middle-aged woman to decide on choosing the passion of the moment or choosing the long-standing support of a devoted husband.This movie and its pace are for audience who appreciate details, subtle emotions, natural settings, simplicities, and animals.  If Pearle Harbor and Con Air were your kind of movies (not that there's anything wrong with them), you may not want to sit through this one.  :)",4,A love for horses and a love for the country,1018915200,"04 16, 2002",2002,1584,"['movie', 'received', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'theatrical', 'run', 'so', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'see', 'When', 'finally', 'saw', 'DVD', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'very', 'un-Hollywood', 'Mr.', 'Redford', 'filmmaker', 'conservationist', 'made', 'ode', 'Montana', 'sky', 'ranch', 'rule', 'land', 'Regardless', 'love', 'horses', 'country', 'scenery', 'not', 'being', 'big', 'city', 'kind', 'girl', 'will', 'feel', 'love', 'care', 'Mr.', 'Redford', 'lavished', 'favorite', 'subjects.The', 'horse', 'Pilgrim', 'devastating', 'accident', 'heartbreakingly', 'portrayed', 'nothing', 'fun', 'seeing', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'wounded', 'animal', 'struggling', 'adjust', 'deal', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'horses', 'heart', 'see', 'film', 'Same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'character', 'Grace', 'way', 'had', 'deal', 'being', 'teenager', 'amputee', 'same', 'time', 'lot', 'handle', 'emotional', 'roughness', 'portrayed', 'parallel', 'way', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'take', 'watching', 'it.As', 'ending', 'really', 'listened', 'Sam', 'Neil', 'speech', 'Miss', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'wife', 'movie', ""'d"", 'realize', 'why', 'decision', 'made', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'decide', 'choosing', 'passion', 'moment', 'choosing', 'long-standing', 'support', 'devoted', 'husband.This', 'movie', 'pace', 'are', 'audience', 'who', 'appreciate', 'details', 'subtle', 'emotions', 'natural', 'settings', 'simplicities', 'animals', 'Pearle', 'Harbor', 'Con', 'Air', 'were', 'kind', 'movies', 'not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'sit', 'one']",N/A

The Montana scenery is just awesome.After a dramatic opening scene in which we see the horse and daughter hurt, the mother (Kristin Scott-Thonas) takes the girl and the horse out West to see if the horse can be salvaged. Unfortunately, the mother - who is married - falls for the horseman ""Tom Booker"" (Redford) and an adulterous relationship almost comes to fruition. That romance is the soap opera part of the film but it's nice to see everyone, including Redford's character, healed of emotional as well as physical wounds.This film is a bit too much of a melodrama at times which makes it a long in spots, but it's a long movie to begin with (169 minutes).

At the time, I was stirred by its quiet, gentle beauty and moving, realistic performances. I have seen it several times since and have enjoyed it every time. ""The Horse Whisperer"" delivers peace into my crazed life.The story centers on a high powered Manattan magazine editor (Kristen Scott-Thomas) and her family. Her daughter becomes involved in a very serious accident with her horse, which results in the loss of one of her legs, the death of her best friend, and severe emotional and physical injury to her beloved horse. Several months later, her mother, at her wits end with her daughter's emotional state, drives the daughter and the horse out to Montana to visit a Horse Whisperer (Robert Redford), a man who can heal the most severely wounded creatures.Of course, it is not just the horse or the daughter who need to be healed, but Scott-Thomas's character as well. However, the movie never verges on the maudlin and instead treats all of its characters and their issues with respect. The cinematography is gorgeous. Every time I see this movie, I want to get into my car and drive out to Montana.I would recommend this movie to moviegoers who enjoy serious, modern stories. There is a strong romantic undercurrent to the story (inevitable with Redford in the lead) but it does not overwhelm the movie. I would not recommend this movie to individuals who need a lot of action or humor or adventure in their films.

The concept is a good one, but I think it becomes strained with too much of the wrong things. The cinematography is wonderful. There are some panoramic scenes of Montana that make the scenes more beautiful. However, as touching and interesting as the story and characters are, I feel that they focus too much on the mother (Kristen Scott Thomas) and her life, and her affair with the Horse Whisperer (Robert Redford), not giving nearly enough focus to the injured daughter and her struggles. The story should be more about the daughter and her horse, and less about the mother and her busy life.

The movie is nearly 2 and a half hours long -- it could have been cut to under two hours had they not spent so much time with the sweeping scenic shots.  Robert Redford is perfectly cast as Tom Booker, The Horse Whisperer... though he seems to be &quot;going through the motions&quot; and not giving too much depth to his character.  That seems to be the problem with all the characters... not enough depth to them.  The story is well done, though clumsy at points.  The story is that of a girl who has an accident with her horse, causing the horse to become unstable and causing her to lose her leg.  So, the mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) takes her and the horse to see The Horse Whisperer.  The character of the mother is by far the most prominent character -- though I think the film should have focused more on the girl and the horse.  The problem is that the really worthwhile scenes with the girl and the horse seem to be overshadowed by the mother and her own problems.  Most of the movie is spent focused on the mother.  Generally speaking, there just isn't enough meat to this film -- not enough depth to the characters.  I won't deny that it is very nice and worth seeing -- I gave it four stars because it is basically good.

449980,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6305126062,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","In 1995, English author Nicholas Evans' novel, ""The Horse Whisperer"" was a best selling novel, selling over 15 million copies and becoming one of the best-selling books of all time.While it was no surprise that a film adaptation would be made, it was more surprising to see actor Robert Redford not only star in the film but also direct it.The film would receive good reviews and would make over $186 million in the box office.VIDEO:""The Horse Whisperer"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1) and features an all new digital restoration.The overall transfer is definitely an upgrade over the previous DVD release. While slight layer of grain can be seen, there is a slight use of DNR as the film looks very clean and sometimes soft.  Fortunately, Touchstone Home Entertainment was able to find a balance and showcase the wonderful cinematography of Robert Richardson (""Shutter Island"", ""Inglourious Basterds"", ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1&#8243;).  Some of the scenery shots, especially the vignette shots look fantastic in HD.Overall, picture quality is very good and for those who owned the previous DVD release, will enjoy the HD upgrade.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Horse Whisperer"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French 5.1 and Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital.  While the primary soundtrack is dialogue-driven through the center and front-channels, the musical score by Thomas Newman and Gwil Owen is fantastic and sounds amazing via lossless.  There are moments such as the accident or the horse kicking around that can be heard through the surround channels, but for the most part, the film's lossless soundtrack is center and front channel driven.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and SpanishSPECIAL FEATURES""The Horse Whisperer""  comes with the following special features:Production Featurette - (1:52) A short production featurette with interviews with Robert Redford.Robert Redford Featurette - (1:32) A short featurette on Robert Redford acting and directing ""The Horse Whisperer"".Buck Brannaman Featurette - (1:42) Robert Redford talks about how his character role was inspired by Buck Brannaman, Buck Brannaman talks about his involvement in the film.Allison Moorer's ""A Soft Place to Fall"" Music Video  - (4:06) A country music video featuring Allison Moorer.Theatrical Trailer - (2:07) The original theatrical trailer for ""The Horse Whisperer"".Theatrical Teaser - (:57) The theatrical teaser for ""The Horse Whisperer"".JUDGMENT CALL:""The Horse Whisperer"" is a delightful and entertaining film showcasing a teenager and a horse that has faced amazing trauma and come to Montana under the help of a man with the special ability to help horses.While long at 169 minutes, Robert Redford takes the audience and sets the pace of the challenge that exist between Grace and her mother Annie, a workaholic editor but also the sadness that she tries to keep inside after losing her right leg.Robert Redford is fantastic as a director and actor in the film and it helps that Redford has amazing talent alongside with him.  Cinematographer Robert Richardson captures the beauty of Montana but also making sure the audience sees the interaction between the characters and the horses.  Along with the beautiful cinematography, the musical by Thomas Newman and Gwil Owen manages to capture the variety of emotions of the characters as Grace tries to get back to her life, while Annie and Tom develop a closer relationship.And as Kristin Scott Thomas does a great job of playing a mother who is not sure about being a mother (but trying her best now after her daughter's injury) and discovering life outside of the big city, the film showed great promise at the time with  actress Scarlett Johansson.  Scarlett manages to capture a teenager who has suffered amazing physical and emotional trauma and Redford manages to bring out her acting with efficacy.But while some people may feel the film is tool long and unnecessary, when I first watched this film many years ago and even now, I still feel the pacing of the film, to build upon character development was necessary and helped establish all three main characters.The character of Tom is quite content of living in Montana, while Annie is often wondering how anyone can be so far from the city and not having major restaurants, shopping, etc.  As for Grace, she is emotionally withdrawn and her injury and how long it takes for her to put her trust in Tom and getting the courage to get close to Pilgrim takes time.  Even Pilgrim took some time in order to get used to being closed to Tom.  If anything, the horse trainers on set, did a wonderful job in making the horses react to the characters.There is a romantic angle that involves Annie and Tom.  We know that Annie who was a workaholic had an unfulfilled marriage to Tom.  But as both she and Tom become more attracted towards each other, it's interesting to see how Tom's sister-in-law reacts to her.  She knows that Tom also needed some time to heal after the death of his wife and now with this amazing talent, the last thing she wants is her brother-in-law getting involved with a married woman.As for the Blu-ray release, the same special features on the original DVD is included.  The upgrade featuring an all-new digital restoration is what should make fans of the film decide to upgrade to Blu-ray.  The film looks and sounds beautiful, but I know that videophiles wanting more grain and no DNR maybe disappointed but for those wanting clear picture quality, they should be thrilled by ""The Horse Whisperer"" being released in HD.Overall, ""The Horse Whisperer"" is a touching film featuring a wonderful performance by Robert Redford, Kristin Scott Thomas and a younger Scarlett Johannson.  Also, featuring beautiful cinematography of the countryside and a beautiful musical score.  It is a long film, slowly paced but in the end, the film was enjoyable.""The Horse Whisperer"" on Blu-ray is recommended!",4,"(Blu-ray) The Horse Whisperer"" is a touching film featuring a wonderful

Wong,"[4, 4]","It seemed to be a struggle for director/star Robert Redford to get this fine film started since many studios passed on it, until the Disney people stated that they would finance it if Redford himself would star in it as well as direct.  Reluctantly Redford did star breaking his cardinal rule that it would be hard to direct and star in the same time--but as luck would have it, the film was a success despite the long shooting schedule.  One of the things I liked about this film is Redford's penchant for developing the character no matter it takes him---and that to me is one of the film's strengths.  Another is that he hired cinematographer Robert Richardson (JFK;Casino) to develop some awestriking visuals, because this film is definitely a visual treat--and should be seen on a big screen.  The Blu-ray edition, though, is excellent and if you have a large HDTV like around 60"" or 65""--you'll definitely enjoy this film.  It's probably the most visual Redford film since ""Jeremiah Johnson"" which I also just purchased recently in Blu-ray.

When my husband brought home this film I was hoping it would be based on his life or his methods. Robert's gift is the knowledge that gentling and gaining the trust of the horse is all about the listening, not the talking even if it is a whisper.This film, which is another story entirely, starts of with one of the most incredible opening scenes ever. Also, the relationships between the teen and her horse, girlfriend, and mother are all very real.Unfortunately, the whole horse whispering plot was not nearly so strong. Redford did not seem to have a genuine relationship with any of his own horses, in fact none even seemed to have names. Whereas Monty, a real horse whisperer, always brought a presence of calm and confidence to horses, often Redford agitated the horse star Pilgrim using more of ""tough love"" methods making observers including the teen girl have to shade eyes and look away. At one point Redford ties one of the horses legs and brings him to the ground in dog- like submission, a very unnatural, terrifying position for a horse. It made me remember one of the methods Monty's SOB father would use to break his horses, and one Monty found entirely unnecessary and harmful to a horses spirit.If you are an animal lover looking for a film for insights on animal human relationships, look elsewhere.

It's about a family who's been torn apart through  a grizzly accident, leaving one teenage girl dead, and another teenage girl  and her prized horse mangled (both physically and mentally).  It's about a  family's thinly veiled serenity being suddenly unmasked, and in the wake  exposes a great vulnerability that lets loose the undercurrent of  depression, frustration and hostility.Annie (Kristin Thomas), a  head-strong, high-pressure magazine editor and world traveler is suddenly  (and maybe for the first time) faced with something she is totally  unprepared to handle--losing her daughter.  Seeing the ever widening gulf,  she becomes desperate enough to leave New York and seek help from an  unusual animal healer, Tom Booker (Robert Redford), a so-called horse  whisperer.  Throwing caution to the wind, and against her husband's wishes  (nicely played by Sam Neil), Annie forces Grace (her daughter) to accompany  her and Pilgrim (Grace's horse) to a small ranch in the vastly open and  rugged state of Montana.This is where the pace of the movie suddenly  changes from the beehive of ""civilization"" to one of sedate morning dew,  deep blue skies, rugged mountain sunsets, and the home-spun reality of a  rancher's way of life.  Booker, who quickly realizes that he has much more  than just a horse to heal, reluctantly takes on the chore.  What follows is  a deliberately paced process of healing.Although this laid-back movie  may not be to everyones' taste (or patience), it worked its magic on me.

The story opens as a young girl, Grace, experiences a terrible accident while riding her horse, Pilgrim, on an icy road. Driven mad by shock and  pain, Pilgrim is almost to the point of death. Grace is also in critical  condition, for she has badly injured her right leg in the accident, and it  must be amputated. Grace's mother Annie (Kristin Scott Thomas) reads about  a man named Tom Booker (Robert Redford) who is known as a &quot;horse  whisperer,&quot; able to communicate and see into the troubled souls of  these animals. A few days later, Annie, along with her hesitant daughter  and Pilgrim in tow, sets out for Montana. There, at Mr. Booker's ranch, do  you witness the amazing changes that occur as Tom begins to heal Pilgrim's  spirit (along with Grace's). Soon after, Annie and Tom fall in love. The  rest of the story unfolds in a symphonic display of love, hope, and  miraculous recoveries. The film's ending is not your typical movie closing,  but it is very good nonetheless. The beautiful Montana landscape adds to  this special aura, and the characters are brilliant (both human and  equine). I highly recommend this excellent movie to absolutely anyone.

And not even a good or believable one, at that!I saw it on tv and was angry enough to come to Amazon and check out the reviews.  Those who gave it high praise and 3, 4, and even 5(!!) stars certainly saw more to it than I did.  I thought I was going to see a story about the healing of a horrifically traumatized horse, by the horse whisperer.But sadly, and to my anger, the horse is only used as the ""hook"" to get you to watch, and an excuse to bring Redford and Scott Thomas together.  Only a few minutes of the whole movie is devoted to the healing of the horse.  The rest of it is devoted to the romance.  The horse is forgotten, and only finally, at the end, miraculously, healed.  We don't get to see the actual method, or the interaction between horse and healer for more than a few minutes, because, sadly, that's not what the movie's about.  The poor horse is only incidental to a laughable ""romance"" between a very young Scott Thomas and a very old Redford.I had decided after watching ""A River Runs Through it"" to never again watch a Redford movie.  I should have stuck to that.If you like Redford romances, go for it.  But don't buy this thinking you're going to watch a moving story about a horse.

First off let me say that the DTS-MA audio was great, the surround sound when implemented was enveloping and the Thomas Newman score was presented nicely. About the first 40 minutes was presented in a box style (1:85:1), borders all around to convey (I guess) life in the city. Once the movie begins the move out to Montana the picture opens up to the more satisfying 2:39:1 aspect ratio and the vistas are just marvelous to look at. Generally the film looks good and is a huge upgrade from the ugly non-anamorphic DVD released in the early days of DVD. However I would have to nitpit with the element used in the mastering of the Blu-ray even though the back cover claims an all-new digital restoration. While some scenes look quite sharp, others look out of focus or soft. Nonetheless we are happy to finally own it on Blu-ray. I hate the cover art but understand why they felt it necessary to photoshop Redford's bust into the artwork. The extras are very brief (each lasting a few minutes) and are in SD.

The story of a New York girl and her horse taken up in the trauma of an accident. The horse has become wild and the girl has lost a leg and finds it difficult to cope, what's more she culpabilizes the accident and the sore fate of the horse. So far nothing special. The mother is a magazine editor and she decides to take the situation in her own hands and to look for help from a rancher in Montana who is known as having very special contact with horses. He is the horse whisperer. In other words he is a horse psychologist. She drops her responsibilities and drives there with the horse and her daughter. It is then the story of the recovery of the horse and of the girl in the hands of that man. Patience, contact, even when necessary some force on the horse and some authority on the girl. The mother and the daughter integrate the ranch and discover a completely different life and rhythm : to live in nature, with animals and raise them. We try to forget that it is only to produce meat. The scenery is grandiose and the absence of any distraction makes the mother and the daughter concentrate on themselves, and regenerate their life energy. Just this adventure is strong anough to be fascinating. It also reveals that these ranchers, who are extremely satisfied in this life, have a past experience of the city (Chicago for instance), of cultural entertainments (classical music for instance) and are not completely cut off from life due to television. But this life also provides children with early activities and responsibilities and makes them grow a lot faster, not so much in their bodies but in their minds and psyches. They are able to cope with life at the age of twelve. This is an amazing education that has to be contrasted with the childish and infantilizing education we provide most kids in our schools. Of course a love, not affair, but adventure develops between the mother and the horse whisperer : change, a completely new universe, the discovery of feelings that are of a new nature. The attitudes of these two and the father that rejoins them at the end are surprising in many ways : the freedom granted by the father to his wife, the responsibility of the mother who will in the end return to New York, and the deepfelt passion of the mother and the horse whisperer that will be dominated and kept human and humane, a passion of the soul which will make it a lot more difficult to break, and yet which will remain totally controled by the mind. No abandon, no reckless delving into it, just accepting it and keeping it within the limits of a humane vision which takes into accounts the interest of others and not only the selfish desires of the lovers. Love becomes then a mental and cultural blending of feelings and experiences. It can be brought to an end but it will always live and survive. The film is extremely moral in a way and tries to show that natural living conditions do not produce uncensored impulses, far from it. To go back to nature builds a deeper moral and ethical approach to life. Some will say that is a myth. Right they are. Some will say that is a dream. Right they are. Some will say that is an illusion. Right they are. But it is something that does exist and that shows human beings are definitely not animals.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Voyage into the psyche of horses,1100131200,"11 11, 2004",2004,3407,"['very', 'fine', 'film', 'maybe', 'little', 'bit', 'slow', 'times', 'due', 'desire', 'capture', 'very', 'special', 'rhythm', 'Montana', 'story', 'New', 'York', 'girl', 'horse', 'taken', 'up', 'trauma', 'accident', 'horse', 'become', 'wild', 'girl', 'lost', 'leg', 'difficult', 'cope', 'what', 'more', 'accident', 'sore', 'fate', 'horse', 'So', 'far', 'nothing', 'special', 'mother', 'magazine', 'editor', 'take', 'situation', 'own', 'hands', 'look', 'help', 'rancher', 'Montana', 'who', 'known', 'having', 'very', 'special', 'contact', 'horses', 'horse', 'whisperer', 'other', 'words', 'horse', 'psychologist', 'responsibilities', 'drives', 'there', 'horse', 'daughter', 'then', 'story', 'recovery', 'horse', 'girl', 'hands', 'man', 'Patience', 'contact', 'even', 'when', 'necessary', 'force', 'horse', 'authority', 'girl', 'mother', 'daughter', 'integrate', 'ranch', 'discover', 'completely', 'different', 'life', 'rhythm', 'live', 'nature', 'animals', 'raise', 'try', 'forget', 'only', 'produce', 'meat', 'scenery', 'grandiose', 'absence', 'distraction', 'mother', 'daughter', 'concentrate', 'regenerate', 'life', 'energy', 'Just', 'adventure', 'strong', 'be', 'fascinating', 'also', 'ranchers', 'who', 'are', 'extremely', 'satisfied', 'life', 'have', 'past', 'experience', 'city', 'Chicago', 'instance', 'cultural', 'entertainments', 'classical', 'music', 'instance', 'are', 'not', 'completely', 'cut', 'off', 'life', 'due', 'television', 'life', 'also', 'children', 'early', 'activities', 'responsibilities', 'grow', 'lot', 'faster', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'bodies', 'minds', 'psyches', 'are', 'able', 'cope', 'life', 'age', 'twelve', 'amazing', 'education', 'be', 'contrasted', 'childish', 'infantilizing', 'education', 'provide', 'most', 'kids', 'schools', 'course', 'love', 'not', 'affair', 'adventure', 'mother', 'horse', 'whisperer', 'change', 'completely', 'new', 'universe', 'discovery', 'feelings', 'are', 'new', 'nature', 'attitudes', 'two', 'father', 'end', 'are', 'surprising', 'many', 'ways', 'freedom', 'granted', 'father', 'wife', 'responsibility', 'mother', 'who', 'will', 'end', 'return', 'New', 'York', 'deepfelt', 'passion', 'mother', 'horse', 'whisperer', 'will', 'be', 'dominated', 'kept', 'human', 'humane', 'passion', 'soul', 'will', 'make', 'lot', 'more', 'difficult', 'break', 'yet', 'will', 'remain', 'totally', 'controled', 'mind', 'abandon', 'reckless', 'delving', 'just', 'accepting', 'keeping', 'limits', 'humane', 'vision', 'accounts', 'interest', 'others', 'not', 'only', 'selfish', 'desires', 'lovers', 'Love', 'then', 'mental', 'cultural', 'blending', 'feelings', 'experiences', 'can', 'be', 'brought', 'end', 'will', 'always', 'live', 'survive', 'film', 'extremely', 'moral', 'way', 'tries', 'show', 'natural', 'living', 'conditions', 'do', 'not', 'produce', 'uncensored', 'impulses', 'far', 'go', 'back', 'nature', 'deeper', 'moral', 'ethical', 'approach', 'life', 'will', 'say', 'myth', 'Right', 'are', 'will', 'say', 'dream', 'Right', 'are', 'will', 'say', 'illusion', 'Right', 'are', 'something', 'exist', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'definitely', 'not', 'animals.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

450017,ARLKYF9JL3QKB,6305126062,J. SHARP,"[57, 59]","Many have already addressed the plot of this film, so I will not not go into detail. However, I feel compelled to touch upon the visual storytelling in this film.Movies are first and foremost imagery. As many legendary filmmakers have said, a good film can be watched with the sound turned off and still communicate every bit of the story and emotion through the images alone. This includes cinematography but goes light years beyond lighting and framing a scene. Each shot must be planned and designed, from sets to props to location scouting, from blocking the actors' movements to using color and shapes, textures, and spatial relationships. All these must communicate the text and subtext simultaneously.I said all that to say this: Redford and his team blew me away with ""The Horse Whisperer."" The first act alone is filled with enough information in every corner of the screen to chew on for days. One example among dozens is the use of symmetry, parallel lines, and perpendicularity in the city scenes - even in the arrangement of books in the background, pens on a desk, or the window blinds in a hospital - to convey the superficially ordered control of Anne's life. This is contrasted with the organic sweeping curves of the farm landscapes where Grace's accident occurs. The confined spaces and straight streets of New York are gradually and gracefully replaced with the curves of the highways as Anne drives west until she reaches the Rockies in all their chaotically ingenious immensity.And apart from all this, I was also deeply effected emotionally by this movie. Yes, it takes its time telling the story. But such stories in our own lives take time to unfold. And real, subtle moments deserve as much time to play out as they need. Grace's recovery from the death of her friend and the injuries to the body and spirit of herself and her faithful horse Pilgrim are also expertly crafted. It has personal resonance in my family because we faced many of the same trials and frustrations when my wife was injured by a tornado a year after we married. She was touched and encouraged by this film.Thomas Newman's score is his masterwork. It brought me to tears during the end credits.Grace is also perfectly portrayed by the then-unknown Scarlett Johansson. Most people seem to forget she was in ""The Horse Whisperer,"" but I will always associate this film with Scarlett and her with it.",5,Brilliant visual artistry,1092960000,"08 20, 2004",2004,2397,"['Many', 'have', 'already', 'addressed', 'plot', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'not', 'go', 'detail', 'However', 'feel', 'compelled', 'touch', 'visual', 'storytelling', 'film.Movies', 'are', 'first', 'foremost', 'imagery', 'many', 'legendary', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'said', 'good', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'sound', 'turned', 'off', 'still', 'communicate', 'bit', 'story', 'emotion', 'images', 'alone', 'cinematography', 'light', 'years', 'lighting', 'framing', 'scene', 'shot', 'must', 'be', 'planned', 'designed', 'sets', 'props', 'location', 'scouting', 'blocking', 'actors', 'movements', 'using', 'color', 'shapes', 'textures', 'spatial', 'relationships', 'must', 'communicate', 'text', 'subtext', 'simultaneously.I', 'said', 'say', 'Redford', 'team', 'blew', 'away', 'Horse', 'Whisperer', 'first', 'act', 'alone', 'filled', 'enough', 'information', 'corner', 'screen', 'chew', 'days', 'One', 'example', 'dozens', 'use', 'symmetry', 'parallel', 'lines', 'perpendicularity', 'city', 'even', 'arrangement', 'books', 'background', 'desk', 'window', 'blinds', 'hospital', 'convey', 'superficially', 'ordered', 'control', 'Anne', 'life', 'contrasted', 'organic', 'sweeping', 'curves', 'farm', 'where', 'Grace', 'accident', 'confined', 'spaces', 'straight', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'are', 'gradually', 'gracefully', 'replaced', 'curves', 'highways', 'Anne', 'west', 'Rockies', 'chaotically', 'ingenious', 'immensity.And', 'apart', 'was', 'also', 'deeply', 'effected', 'emotionally', 'movie', 'Yes', 'time', 'telling', 'story', 'such', 'stories', 'own', 'lives', 'take', 'time', 'unfold', 'real', 'subtle', 'moments', 'deserve', 'much', 'time', 'play', 'out', 'need', 'Grace', 'recovery', 'death', 'friend', 'injuries', 'body', 'spirit', 'herself', 'faithful', 'horse', 'Pilgrim', 'are', 'also', 'expertly', 'crafted', 'personal', 'resonance', 'family', 'faced', 'many', 'same', 'trials', 'frustrations', 'when', 'wife', 'was', 'injured', 'tornado', 'year', 'married', 'was', 'touched', 'encouraged', 'film.Thomas', 'Newman', 'score', 'masterwork', 'brought', 'tears', 'end', 'credits.Grace', 'also', 'perfectly', 'portrayed', 'then-unknown', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Most', 'people', 'seem', 'forget', 'was', 'Horse', 'Whisperer', 'will', 'always', 'associate', 'film', 'Scarlett']",N/A
450018,A2GB5CG77LGQRB,6305126062,Jublistic,"[3, 4]","The Horse WhispererScore: 83/100Adapted from Nick Evan's stunning novel, The Horse Whisperer is an endearing and surprising look into country life and healing horses. It opens with a truly haunting scene, and just continues to get better and better. By the end of the movie, you'll be trying with a lot of effort to catch your breath...this is one heck of a film, really it is, so don't miss out.It is a cold winter day. Grace (Scarlett Johansson) and her best friend Judith (Kate Bosworth) go for a ride with their horses, but a terrible accident changes her life forever. A truck hits them; Judith and her horse are killed, while Grace and her horse Pilgrim are seriously injured, both physically and mentally. In an attempt to bring Pilgrim back from his now savage condition, Grace's mother Annie (Kristin Scott Thomas) takes them to Montana in search for Tom Booker (Robert Redford). Tom is a &quot;horse Whisperer&quot;, a cowboy with the ability to &quot;communicate&quot; with horses. In the land of the Wild West Annie will change the way she sees life forever, as the wise cowboy slowly heals the souls of Pilgrim and Grace...It's not perfect, and the running time is, as with all Robert Redford's films, over-long, but the 2-and-a-half-hour's buzz by, it seems like your only sitting in your seat for a half an hour. Still, 2.5 hours is just pushing the limit. But, as I said, that doesn't effect us, Robert Redford's direction is hard not to praise, he brings Nick Evan's great novel stunningly to life, the film has a largely plausible cinematographer, and the whole movie looks like a crystal clear dream. Also commendable are the amazing performances, the British Kristin Scott Thomas is on fire as Annie, she has a fiery chemistry with Robert Redford (also directing). However, the main acting star is surprisingly teen actor Scarlett Johansson, who brings the emotionally scarred Grace truthfully to life, her performance is truly moving, she plays a character, not an actor, and that is an extremely hard thing for an actress her age to do.The Horse Whisperer not only demands repeated viewings, it commands to be praised, and it is.

It has taken me a while to understand why director/star Robert Redford ended on a moral high note.  I believe he was trying to convey lessons he had learned from mistakes he made in his personal life.Panned for its length, happily the leisurely pace of The Horse Whisperer is today a visual valentine to the breadth of our great country, from snowy New England meadows to majestic thunderstorms in Western mountain ranges.  The movie has aged like a fine wine and I have to periodically uncant it to savor Redford's grace notes - the way Tom Booker (Redford) secures a missed button on Annie's (Kirstin Scott Thomas) dress; the various stations coming over the car radio during the journey west; the look on Grace's (Scarlett Johansson) face when she realizes she can drive; that one slow waltz between Annie and Tom which conveys more raw emotion than most torrid sex scenes.What's not to like here?  No director has managed to elict a finer performance from Johansson; Kirstin Scott Thomas is at the peak of her beauty; Chris Cooper, Diane Weist and Sam Neill are all pitch perfect, heck even the little Booker boys are great.  Although the plot centers around a kind, wise and patient animal trainer who nurses a girl and her stallion back to health, the healer is only human and I believe he fell for Annie from the first time he laid eyes on her which adds the poignancy of this memorable movie.

This country is concentrated on the coasts. The other country is made up of the people who grow the food and build things and do most of the actual work. This nation exists mainly in the heartland. Neither group has much use for the other and don't communicate much except when a member of the elite has to pretend to be of the heartland to get elected.

The smashed innocence of youth, the imperious maneuvering of an overbearing mother/executive - executive/mother, and the seemingly willing doormat of a husband are all played against the shadow of a horribly injured horse, which for a time are the only wounds the players really acknowledge. It's easy to get involved in the plight of Pilgrim, the horse, but as the story progresses, it becomes clear that the horse's injuries are small potatoes compared to the injuries shouldered and nurtured by Scott Thomas (the mother) and her daughter - as well as Redford (the Whisperer), although I didn't piece that together until I'd watched it a second time.Redford and Scott Thomas are at the top of their game (I'm not much of a Redford fan and I'm only beginning to appreciate what a gem Scott Thomas is), and although Horse Whisperer subtly leads the viewer astray for a time, deliberately focusing on the injuries to the horse and the daughter, about 45min in to the movie you can sense real intrigue developing between Redford and Scott Thomas. Redford plays the strong, semi-silent Marlboro man (masking his own injuries behind a thick veneer of quiet competence), and Scott Thomas transports her restless world of conference-calls, cell phones, fax machines and overworked anxiety to the Big Sky meadows of Montana. It takes days, weeks, for her to recognize the incongruity; however, eventually the recognizes the quiet value hidden in ranch life, and when she does, Scott Thomas sheds her urban values in a rush - for a time.I've enjoyed this movie several times - one of the few times I agree with the professional critics.

Robert Redford's direction of 'The Horse Whisperer' is a triumph. A deeply emotionally touching film, in which Redford also stars,it offers stunning scenery and cinematography as well as many beautiful layers of metaphor, symbology and juxtaposition. It's a film which explores themes of redemption and healing. Healing of both the human and animal spirit as well as the healing of broken relationships and families.Grace's broken body and spirit (The result of a devastating riding accident, resulting in her best friends death) as well as her troubled relationship with Mother 'Annie',are beautifully juxtaposed with that of her badly injured and traumatised, beloved horse Pilgrim. The failing marriage of her parents,contributing further to the disconnection of the family unit, also adds another interesting layer to the film and plot.Enter 'Tom Booker' reluctantly persuaded out of semi-retirement by the persistant Annie as the especially skilled and gifted horse trainer/healer (or 'Horse Whisperer' as legend has it), and who also becomes the catalyst in the bridging of the gaps between each member of this family in crisis.  Their time spent away from New York in the beautiful natural 'Montanna' setting with Booker(and family),along with Pilgrim's difficult and gradual journey back through Bookers 'healing ways', gives Grace the faith, confidence and inspiration she herself needs to regain her strength of spirit and will to overcome her physical obstacle. It also helps in offering a way for Mother and daughter to reconnect. Through Grace's traumatic accident and away from her familiar enviroment Annie's character is forced to re-think her life as the previously workaholic and somewhat controlling absent parent. The attraction and connection between Tom Booker and Annie obviously adds the obligatory Romantic interest, but more importantly it provides the final turning point for Annie's character, when she is forced to make a choice between her own quest for personal happiness and what is ultimately best for her daughter.Kristen Scott Thomas (Annie) and a very young Scarlett Johansson (Grace) are superb in their roles. Sam Neill plays his small supporting role as the husband and Father, nicely and an although aging 'Robert Redford' is still convincing and ruggedly charimastic as Booker. The real star of this film however is Redford's direction and camera team. The film is so visually powerful; full of both subtle nuances and dramatic contrasts of light,darkness,sound and setting. Be warned there are some confronting scenes. As an animal lover I admit I found the graphically dramatic depiction of the horsing accident and Pilgrim's terror and suffering, quite unsettling and difficult to watch. The breathtaking Montanna scenery is a welcoming escape and contrast from the dark, synthetic and repressive New York City scenes. When Grace and Annie set off on their rambling long journey across mid-north America with horse in tow, the mood becomes one full of hope and adventure. Gradually too the characters regain hope and strength through this adventure and long journey of the human soul. In a sense they are reborn; revived by nature and the deep bond which exists between animal and human. That is ultimately what moved me the most about this story.The critics as I remember didn't give this film its due when it came out. Many fobbed it off as some sort of sentimental, contrived 'Robert Redford Vehicle'. Far from it. It is an exceptionally well acted, well crafted, deeply moving and inspiring story and movie experience.",5,Healing Through the Animal/Human Connection.,1136332800,"01 4, 2006",2006,3668,"['one', 'who', 'interested', 'animal/human', 'spirit', 'connection', 'film', 'must', ""n't"", 'miss', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'direction', ""'The"", 'Horse', 'Whisperer', 'triumph', 'deeply', 'emotionally', 'touching', 'film', 'Redford', 'also', 'stunning', 'scenery', 'cinematography', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'beautiful', 'layers', 'metaphor', 'symbology', 'juxtaposition', 'film', 'themes', 'redemption', 'healing', 'Healing', 'human', 'animal', 'spirit', 'as', 'well', 'healing', 'broken', 'relationships', 'families.Grace', 'broken', 'body', 'spirit', 'result', 'devastating', 'riding', 'accident', 'resulting', 'best', 'friends', 'death', 'as', 'well', 'troubled', 'relationship', 'Mother', ""'Annie"", 'are', 'beautifully', 'juxtaposed', 'badly', 'injured', 'traumatised', 'beloved', 'horse', 'Pilgrim', 'failing', 'marriage', 'parents', 'contributing', 'further', 'disconnection', 'family', 'unit', 'also', 'interesting', 'layer', 'film', 'plot.Enter', 'Booker', 'reluctantly', 'persuaded', 'semi-retirement', 'persistant', 'Annie', 'especially', 'skilled', 'gifted', 'horse', 'trainer/healer', ""'Horse"", 'Whisperer', 'legend', 'who', 'also', 'catalyst', 'bridging', 'gaps', 'member', 'family', 'crisis', 'time', 'spent', 'away', 'New', 'York', 'beautiful', 'natural', ""'Montanna"", 'setting', 'Booker', 'family', 'Pilgrim', 'difficult', 'gradual', 'journey', 'back', 'Bookers', ""'healing"", 'ways', 'Grace', 'faith', 'confidence', 'inspiration', 'regain', 'strength', 'spirit', 'will', 'overcome', 'physical', 'obstacle', 'also', 'offering', 'way', 'Mother', 'daughter', 'reconnect', 'Grace', 'traumatic', 'accident', 'away', 'familiar', 'enviroment', 'Annie', 'character', 'forced', 're-think', 'life', 'previously', 'workaholic', 'somewhat', 'controlling', 'absent', 'parent', 'attraction', 'connection', 'Tom', 'Booker', 'Annie', 'obviously', 'obligatory', 'Romantic', 'interest', 'more', 'importantly', 'final', 'turning', 'point', 'Annie', 'character', 'when', 'forced', 'make', 'choice', 'own', 'quest', 'personal', 'happiness', 'what', 'ultimately', 'best', 'daughter.Kristen', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'Annie', 'very', 'young', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Grace', 'are', 'superb', 'roles', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'small', 'supporting', 'role', 'husband', 'Father', 'nicely', 'aging', ""'Robert"", 'Redford', 'still', 'convincing', 'ruggedly', 'charimastic', 'Booker', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'however', 'Redford', 'direction', 'camera', 'team', 'film', 'so', 'visually', 'powerful', 'full', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'dramatic', 'contrasts', 'light', 'darkness', 'sound', 'setting', 'Be', 'warned', 'are', 'confronting', 'scenes', 'animal', 'lover', 'admit', 'found', 'graphically', 'dramatic', 'depiction', 'horsing', 'accident', 'Pilgrim', 'terror', 'suffering', 'quite', 'unsettling', 'difficult', 'watch', 'breathtaking', 'Montanna', 'scenery', 'welcoming', 'escape', 'contrast', 'dark', 'synthetic', 'repressive', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'scenes', 'When', 'Grace', 'Annie', 'set', 'off', 'rambling', 'long', 'journey', 'mid-north', 'America', 'horse', 'tow', 'mood', 'one', 'full', 'hope', 'adventure', 'Gradually', 'too', 'characters', 'regain', 'hope', 'strength', 'adventure', 'long', 'journey', 'human', 'soul', 'sense', 'are', 'reborn', 'revived', 'nature', 'deep', 'bond', 'animal', 'human', 'ultimately', 'what', 'moved', 'most', 'story.The', 'critics', 'remember', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'film', 'due', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'Many', 'fobbed', 'off', 'sort', 'sentimental', 'contrived', ""'Robert"", 'Redford', 'Vehicle', 'Far', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'crafted', 'deeply', 'moving', 'inspiring', 'story', 'movie', 'experience']",N/A

450062,ANUBY6KOT60WH,6305126062,R. Galeano Valencia,"[8, 10]","To say that this movie is about the relationship between a little girl and her horse is a gross understatement. For the beautiful screen adaptation of Nicholas Evans' novel under Robert Redford's master direction is a soothing canticle for the spirit. A song of hope, that touches our hearts, as the minuscule and almost unnoticeable drop of rain does when kissing a flower's petal by the dying shadows of sunrise. This is a story that says that love is everpresent patience, particularly in those times when the object of our affection seems to be distant, or even lost. It is about falling into the dark abyss of hopelessness when we realize that for whatever reasons perhaps we have been taking for granted the very things that in the end, are the ones that keep us breathing. Or even learning, that sometimes we have to let go of certain things, for others to stay and blossom.Grace Mc Lean (a very young Scarlett Johansson) has a terrible accident while riding her horse Pilgrim. As a result, Grace's best friend dies, and both Grace and Pilgrim are left with terrible physical and emotional injuries to endure. The terrible circumstances in which the McLeans are caught up into, begin to uncover the many cracks and emotional holes existing in the relationship between Robert and Annie (Grace's parents) most of them masterfully hidden under years of routine and probably under a comfortable carelessness. After the accident, young Grace starts to slide down into an abyss of emotional bitterness and frustration which is  endangering both her soul and spirit.A confused Annie, will cling on to the hope that Pilgrim's recovery may also probably be a way to Grace's emotional healing, so she starts to research into the somewhat seclusive world of horses, finding out about Tom Booker (Robert Redford) a renowned ""horse whisperer"" with a special touch for troubled animals who lives out in the prairies of Montana. In a desperate move she sets out to the country to find Booker, along with a reluctant Grace and the sick horse in a trailer. During this trip to the unexpected, Annie will find herself confronting the harshness of her own frustrations and failures as a distant mother, perhaps more involved with her career than with her family, and also with the overwhelming sadness of a marriage and a love once new that, though still there, has now grown old and empty.A shaken and vulnerable Annie and a lost and hurt Grace, will ultimately end up finding strength and purpose in Tom Booker's devotional dedication to Pilgrim's recovery. Somehow it seems that by -patiently yet strongly- taming Pilgrim and his scarred soul, Booker is taming his own spirit as well as Grace's and Annie's, so they all can come to accept those things they cannot change, while being brave enough to change those they can. The overwhelming presence of nature and the vast landscape will also make them discover the joy hidden in simple things as the blessings we all enjoy just merely for being alive. Eventually a love story unfolds between Annie and Tom but despite the strong feelings for each other, they realize that their coming together would eventually require them to sacrifice too much, so even loving each other, they ultimately choose to let each other go. In time, Pilgrim's progresses mean acceptance and fortitude and an unexpected maturity for the young Grace who slowly begins to overcome her tragedy with acceptance and courage. Ultimately she finds herself in peace with the burden that has been put over her young shoulders. When Annie, Grace and Pilgrim set back to NY they will physically seem to be returning back to their old lives, but is just obvious, that all of their lives have been changed forever. So they are not really returning, but beginning to travel a path to someplace totally new.The scenery, the marvelous natural landscapes, the photography are just spectacular. Simply beyond words. The music provides a perfect background to the movie and the original soundtrack by Thomas Newman including moving pieces like ""The vast continent"", ""Angus"", ""Your misfortune -none of my own"", ""Pilgrim's progress""... is out of this world, being one of my favorites ever and by far one of the most beautiful scores I have ever listened.

450064,A1MIFU0YKLG40T,6305126062,Rick Galati,"[3, 4]","This is a richly acted and beautifully photographed film about wounded psyches of both the human and animal kind. The disturbing horse/vehicle accident at the beginning of the film is realistic and even painful to watch but is essential in establishing the depth of the emotional torment that followed in its tragic and inevitable wake. Physically maimed for life, young Grace MacLean had a great deal of physical and emotional healing in her immediate future. I cannot say enough about the superb acting of young Scarlett Johansson in bringing a certain depth and sensitivity to this demanding role. She was simply brilliant in a quiet and understated way. Both Grace and her beloved horse ""Pilgrim"" who narrowly avoided being put down as a result of his awful trauma injuries are both destined to begin a slow emotional healing process even more painful than the setting of mere bone and scarred flesh. The restorative process leads Grace's high achieving mother Annie (Kristin Scott-Thomas) to take Grace and Pilgrim on a cross country motor journey to distant Montana to seek out the services of noted ""horse whisperer"" Tom Booker.  Robert Redford was at his acting best in this role and in a minimalist way he quietly defined a serene and hard working rancher whose unique gift was an almost otherworldly understanding of animals.  Annie had personal issues of her own to deal with that transcended the focus of the trip and she too had to sort through a complex stew of emotional feelings laid bare as a result of the experience. As the process of healing plays itself out over time at the Booker ranch, all too human emotional baggage attached to everyone involved is inevitably exposed, aided no doubt by a close and personal proximity. This is where Redford positively shined as director. He never forced issues, always allowing individual moments of epiphany to unfold in a naturally relaxed way. The film ends in a bittersweet but profoundly sober manner, not unlike the way life often unfolds for those with holes in their heart. Bring a handkerchief to this one, you'll not be disappointed. Whether you shed a tear of joy or sorrow matters not.

Watching Pilgrim reminds us of Lee Marvin's comment on receiving an Academy Award for Cat Ballou: ""this really belongs to a horse somewhere in Nevada"". While this is supposed to be a story about people, Redford as director couldn't avoid the clich&eacute; of scenes of sweeping vistas, pleasing to watch but contributing nothing to an already thin plot. This isn't a film about frontier development, it's supposed to be about a horse shrink confronted by an Eastern ""modern woman.""

Redford has these aplenty, but the source material inevitably undercut even his abilities. Evans' unique version of a Harlequin Romance was designed for the screen - simplistic, implausible and meritless. The only thing positive here is that Redford translated Evans' characters into film without a hitch. Easily done since the only one with any depth is [again] the horse. Redford simply plays himself in the role Tom Booker. His opening scenes are nearly all mute, but Redford can pull that off with his piercing gaze. He personifies the laconic solitary rancher with ease. Regrettably, Evans' story forces Booker to fall for Anne MacLean, a woman with no redeeming characteristics whatsoever. Neither book nor film provided a shred of motive for this bizarre romance, we are simply presented the situation in text and scene as if perfectly natural. Thomas, as MacLean, conveys the self-centred, amoral and predatory publishing executive almost flawlessly. She blithely enters the affair with no shred of conscience for her betrayed husband, Sam Neill. What is the motivation for this marital treason? Sam couldn't do his job from Montana? We never find out just what made MacLean attractive to Booker. As it turns out, that isn't important.We come at last to the one who's supposed to be the important character, Grace, the teen-age amputee. Evans was careful not to burden the horse with manic-depressive tendencies resulting from Grace MacLean's crippling. We're left to think that being smacked by a semi was cause enough. In the event, even her handicap loses its importance. Grace has a more crippling situation to deal with, a mother whose behaviour would make a spider blush. Evans, of course, fit the story into 20th Century social norms by having Grace ultimately accept her father's cuckolding. The film reprises this seditious scenario, leaving Sam Neill the modern hapless male. [One wonders when he's going to break the weak reed parts he's been saddled with.] Annie MacLean wants the western hunk, she snares him and that's justification enough. It also turns out to be the single point of both book and film. Not much substance, but Redford didn't have much to work with.",2,Pilgrim prances away with it!,1001289600,"09 24, 2001",2001,3060,"['Considered', 'solely', 'merits', 'film', 'thing', 'borders', 'pathetic', 'one', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'horse', 'performance', 'cameraman', 'who', 'captured', 'horse', 'really', 'worked', 'hay', 'Watching', 'Pilgrim', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'comment', 'receiving', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Cat', 'Ballou', 'really', 'horse', 'somewhere', 'Nevada', 'supposed', 'be', 'story', 'people', 'Redford', 'director', 'could', ""n't"", 'avoid', 'clich', 'eacute', 'scenes', 'sweeping', 'vistas', 'pleasing', 'watch', 'contributing', 'nothing', 'already', 'thin', 'plot', ""n't"", 'film', 'frontier', 'development', 'supposed', 'be', 'horse', 'shrink', 'confronted', 'Eastern', 'modern', 'woman', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'Redford', 'provide', 'urban', 'shots', 'contrast', 'must', 'be', 'fair', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Converting', 'worst', 'novel', 'past', 'generation', 'film', 'took', 'courage', 'talent', 'Redford', 'aplenty', 'source', 'material', 'inevitably', 'undercut', 'even', 'abilities', 'Evans', 'unique', 'version', 'Harlequin', 'Romance', 'was', 'designed', 'screen', 'simplistic', 'implausible', 'meritless', 'only', 'thing', 'positive', 'here', 'Redford', 'translated', 'Evans', 'characters', 'film', 'hitch', 'Easily', 'done', 'only', 'one', 'depth', '[', 'again', ']', 'horse', 'Redford', 'simply', 'role', 'Tom', 'Booker', 'opening', 'scenes', 'are', 'nearly', 'mute', 'Redford', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'piercing', 'gaze', 'laconic', 'solitary', 'rancher', 'ease', 'Regrettably', 'Evans', 'story', 'forces', 'Booker', 'fall', 'Anne', 'MacLean', 'woman', 'redeeming', 'characteristics', 'whatsoever', 'book', 'film', 'provided', 'shred', 'motive', 'bizarre', 'romance', 'are', 'simply', 'presented', 'situation', 'text', 'scene', 'perfectly', 'natural', 'Thomas', 'MacLean', 'conveys', 'self-centred', 'amoral', 'predatory', 'publishing', 'executive', 'almost', 'flawlessly', 'blithely', 'affair', 'shred', 'conscience', 'betrayed', 'husband', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'What', 'motivation', 'marital', 'treason', 'Sam', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'job', 'Montana', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'made', 'MacLean', 'attractive', 'Booker', 'out', ""n't"", 'important.We', 'come', 'last', 'one', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'important', 'character', 'Grace', 'teen-age', 'amputee', 'Evans', 'was', 'careful', 'not', 'burden', 'horse', 'manic-depressive', 'tendencies', 'resulting', 'Grace', 'MacLean', 'crippling', ""'re"", 'left', 'think', 'being', 'smacked', 'semi', 'was', 'cause', 'enough', 'event', 'even', 'handicap', 'importance', 'Grace', 'more', 'crippling', 'situation', 'deal', 'mother', 'behaviour', 'would', 'make', 'spider', 'blush', 'Evans', 'course', 'fit', 'story', '20th', 'Century', 'social', 'norms', 'having', 'Grace', 'ultimately', 'accept', 'father', 'cuckolding', 'film', 'seditious', 'scenario', 'leaving', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'modern', 'hapless', 'male', '[', 'One', 'wonders', 'when', 'going', 'break', 'weak', 'reed', 'parts', 'been', 'saddled', ']', 'Annie', 'MacLean', 'western', 'hunk', 'justification', 'enough', 'also', 'out', 'be', 'single', 'point', 'book', 'film', 'Not', 'much', 'substance', 'Redford', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'work']",N/A
