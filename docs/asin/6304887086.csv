It was refreshing to watch some very real people living real lives and being sincere about their feelings.  No one planned the outcome and it all just seemed to happen naturally,  which is rarely the case in stories like this. The story is wonderful and touching and the acting is excellent!

Yes the lonely wife....someone who came into a new woman out of curiosity at the least.  The teacher....looking into the unknown land of women with women.  Late bloomers?  Hmmm  I see more in their 50's.  But this is a story for the heart.  Their bond became solid in no time.  How wonderful!  It was never in doubt.  As it should be.  And to end in a wedding was the very best.  I wish I was that lucky!This is so very sweet.  Their faces light up with a look at each other.  They know what they need to do and do it.

I liked seeing two middle aged women acting like hormonal teenagers. The early scenes between the two were funny and heartwarming.2. There was more then one bedroom scene. To call them sex scenes would be slightly wrong. You didn't actually see the sex but you did see them together in bed talking like lovers. I liked that. Too many movies have one big love scene and thats it. I simply like to see two grown women having a passionate affair.3. The husband/ex-husband. I liked him. He was a nice guy who seemed to be at a loss for why his wife fell in love with a woman. He had two really good scenes. One with the woman who stole his wife and at the end of the movie where he tried to expain why the two women got fired... I've read a few reviews that said he was unrealistic, and maybe he was, but I've heard stories about men who acted like him. Yeah they got angry but in end they were still nice guys.What I didn't like.1. The daughter. Don't know why. She just got on my nerves.2. The ending. Don't know either. Just got on my nerves.3. Some diaglog was awkard. Some characters were awkward.All in all I'd give the movie a B. Better then some. Worse then others.

Their romance turns their school coworkers and parents' association on their small-minded heads but eventually many in the community recognize the true love these ladies have found with each other. Prejudices are examined and cast aside by many, including the unappreciative husband and slutty teen daughter.  Both actresses are touchingly poignant in their portrayals of two women swept up by unexpected emotions that affect everyone in their world.  For any woman ignored by her spouse because of her weight gain, and for any woman who feels sexless because she doesn't exhibit society's ideas of femininity, this film will give you hope for the possibility of love coming your way.
