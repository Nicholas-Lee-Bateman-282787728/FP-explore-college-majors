Sketches were often abandoned with a fourth-wall break, because there was no other way out. Big laughs were often put off in lieu of a series of quick-witted verbal exchanges; the amount of word play is almost exhausting, and you really don't catch most of it until the third or fourth time through. It's the only sketch comedy show I know that gets better each time you watch it, making it fully worth buying in a set like this. My only complaint about the set is its presentation; realizing that A Bit of Fry and Laurie doesn't have a huge fan base in the United States, the package design is simply the four individual seasons put into a slip case. It works great, and I don't really have any complaints about that, but I would think it a better use of materials to have used slim cases or a fold-out case, like Lost or Heroes.Otherwise?

1018359,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B000I2IP2K,Christopher Culver,"[30, 33]","A BIT OF FRY AND LAURIE was a sketch comedy programme that ran on the BBC between 1989-95 for four series (seasons in American terminology) marked by eccentric humour. It's a tiring trope to hear any British comedy programme compared to Monty Python, but I think in this case that can give you some idea of what to expect. But Fry and Laurie throw in quite a bit of highbrow or outright intellectual humour, with sketches referencing everything from De Saussure's distinction of ""langue"" and ""parole"" in linguistics to Plato's notion of forms and the commonplaces of the Tolkien-style fantasy genre. Sometimes we find metacomedy, where a sketch is interrupted halfway through, and the comedians address the camera, or we even cut to another sketch where Fry and Laurie play critics analysing the last. The comedic dynamic is based on the opposition of these two comedians, with Laurie the often scatterbrained funny guy and Fry the prim straight man. Both Fry and Laurie are quite talented in imitating other English accents, from Australian to Scottish, although only Laurie successfully manages American and working class UK accents. With many of the sketches are perennial, others are very much if its time, capturing the political polemics, celebrity scandals, ""Yuppie"" phenomenon and popular music of the time. Far from making it unpleasantly dated, in my experience these facets only add to the humour.I think the first season is the strongest, and then the quality progressively declines. From the second season everything seems too glossy and contrived, with the beginning episodes had a sort of amateur charm to them. We get too many of Hugh Laurie's musical sketches, some of which aren't even comedic anymore. In the final series, guests appear on each episode, which pushes Fry and Laurie out of their own programme. Therein lies a conundrum, for I cannot recommand the complete DVD set to just anyone, because they may not enjoy all or even most of it. However, I cannot recommend just getting the set of the first series because then, if you like it and want to see more, it'll cost so much more to get the complete set. However, this programme is floating around out there, and I think if you previewed it first you'd have a better idea of whether the complete set or even just the release of the first series is worth it.",3,"Among the most intelligent programmes I've ever seen on television, but its quality steadily wanes",1244505600,"06 9, 2009",2009,2337,"['BIT', 'OF', 'FRY', 'AND', 'LAURIE', 'was', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'programme', 'ran', 'BBC', '1989-95', 'four', 'series', 'seasons', 'American', 'terminology', 'marked', 'eccentric', 'humour', 'tiring', 'trope', 'hear', 'British', 'comedy', 'programme', 'compared', 'Monty', 'Python', 'think', 'case', 'can', 'give', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'Fry', 'Laurie', 'throw', 'quite', 'bit', 'highbrow', 'outright', 'intellectual', 'humour', 'sketches', 'referencing', 'everything', 'De', 'Saussure', 'distinction', 'langue', 'parole', 'linguistics', 'Plato', 'notion', 'forms', 'commonplaces', 'Tolkien-style', 'fantasy', 'genre', 'Sometimes', 'find', 'metacomedy', 'where', 'sketch', 'interrupted', 'halfway', 'comedians', 'address', 'camera', 'even', 'cut', 'sketch', 'where', 'Fry', 'Laurie', 'play', 'critics', 'analysing', 'last', 'comedic', 'dynamic', 'based', 'opposition', 'two', 'comedians', 'Laurie', 'often', 'scatterbrained', 'funny', 'guy', 'Fry', 'prim', 'straight', 'man', 'Fry', 'Laurie', 'are', 'quite', 'talented', 'imitating', 'other', 'English', 'accents', 'Australian', 'Scottish', 'only', 'Laurie', 'successfully', 'American', 'working', 'class', 'UK', 'accents', 'many', 'sketches', 'are', 'perennial', 'others', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'time', 'capturing', 'political', 'polemics', 'celebrity', 'scandals', 'Yuppie', 'phenomenon', 'popular', 'music', 'time', 'Far', 'making', 'unpleasantly', 'dated', 'experience', 'facets', 'only', 'add', 'humour.I', 'think', 'first', 'season', 'strongest', 'then', 'quality', 'progressively', 'second', 'season', 'everything', 'too', 'glossy', 'contrived', 'beginning', 'episodes', 'had', 'sort', 'amateur', 'charm', 'get', 'too', 'many', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'musical', 'sketches', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'comedic', 'anymore', 'final', 'series', 'guests', 'appear', 'episode', 'Fry', 'Laurie', 'own', 'programme', 'Therein', 'conundrum', 'can', 'not', 'recommand', 'complete', 'DVD', 'set', 'just', 'anyone', 'may', 'not', 'enjoy', 'even', 'most', 'However', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'just', 'getting', 'set', 'first', 'series', 'then', 'like', 'want', 'see', 'more', ""'ll"", 'cost', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'get', 'complete', 'set', 'However', 'programme', 'floating', 'around', 'there', 'think', 'previewed', 'first', ""'d"", 'have', 'better', 'idea', 'complete', 'set', 'even', 'just', 'release', 'first', 'series']",A Bit Of Fry And Laurie Complete Collection Series 1 - 4 Box [DVD] [Region2] Requires a Multi Region Player

1018362,AQIRBENYADT43,B000I2IP2K,Eddy,"[31, 33]","In retrospect this DVD collection is the purchase I wish I had made. Having shelled out for all 4 series of 'A Bit of Fry & Laurie' individually, each one more hilarious than the last, I recommend that comedy fans simply invest in this 4 in 1 pack.Throughout these fantastic series, Stephen Fry's wit and Hugh Laurie's whimsy never fail to hit the spot. The pairing like to mock everything that the eighties held dear including ruthless black hearted capitalism, vulgar fashion sense and the incumbent Tory government. Allied to the ruthless satire is the pair's amusing habit of toying with and manipulating the English language in a hilarious manner. Far from trying to escape their upper class, Oxbridge backgrounds, they instead choose to embrace them as fully as possible.Many American viewers will have come to Hugh Laurie through his part in the series 'House' and possibly could have come to Stephen Fry through the part he played in the American series 'Bones'. To these Americans I say that it is an absolute must for you to look through all the past works of these two comic masters. As well as this series check out 'Jeeves & Wooster', 'Blackadder' and the many books that Stephen Fry has published.

The greatest bits from Cook and Moore, or Monty Python, would be a 5, or even 6, star collection. Unfortunately, there is more to both teams than their best bits. Since we have so little of Pete and Dud, it's hard to say. But with Monty Python, there were hours of unwatchable junk. Sorry, folks, it is true. However, when they were on, they were exquisite. Sublime, funny, and philosophical, with a clever and biting humor that took your breath away. There is a reason we know the words to the Cheese Shop sketch 30+ years later; it was entrancing. I remember watching that sketch when it was new; I knew right away this was more than just funny.Nothing in this set rises to those miraculous heights. Thankfullly though, nothing sinks to the dregs so common on the MP show either. This is hours of clever and witty stuff, with lots of laughs all over. The music is especially well done. Yet too many laughs are supposed to come from the use of naughty words, or Hugh and Stephen dressed as women. The naughty words are not necessarily funny, nor are men shrieking in women's clothing. (See way too many MP sketches for examples.) Overall though, there are plenty of excellent sketches, well delivered and well acted. (The supporting cast is often astounding.) As others have said, the laughs do decline badly in Series 4, and we can only be grateful they hung it up then.So, nothing that makes you say ""That was ****ing brilliant!"" but plenty to make you say ""That was fun.""

The sketches themselves can be hit or miss overall,  but there are still a couple of real gems-- my favorite is a short but incredibly funny bit in the last season, in which Stephen Fry is chopping vegetables & attempting to make a salad while trying to pleasantly discuss his evening of going to the theater with the viewer-- I won't spoil the fun, but he gets unexpectedly & explosively angry out of the blue, then smoothly goes back & forth between the outbursts of anger & his more quiet & polite theater-talk mode.  This sketch is my favorite Stephen Fry bit of all time, outside of his ""General Meltchett"" harangues in ""Blackadder IV"" (and of course his incredibly loud & abusive Gen. Nelson in ""Blackadder III"", in which he got to slap Hugh Laurie around!). The last season is probably the best-- also love it when Hugh Laurie does his Python-esque ""pepper-pot""-ish drag character,interfering with the man-on-the-street (or should I say, ""woman""-on-the-street) interview with a pre-""Mrs. Stephen Fry"" character (Fry's alter-ego on Twitter as his fictional beleaguered wife & inept mother of their fictional children-- see ""Mrs. Stephen Fry's Diary"", which was published in book form as a collection of his/""her"" collected tweets!

1018366,A27VMEB55OY9LS,B000I2IP2K,Kathy-W,"[0, 0]","How do you summarize a show like this one? Maybe you don't. For better or worse, some reviewers have compared it to Monty Python. The verdict's still out on that, unless it is a reference to the random formatting of the show through the years.They lampooned, they parodied, they attacked...but they usually did it without ruffling a hair out of place, and they only seldom swore compared to some of the pure stand-up figures of history. The few moments they spent on screaming fits or foul language are mostly so well-timed that they just made the big picture even funnier. There is something intriguing about a duo that can do such busy things without losing composure or having a fit of camera shyness even once. It seems that the ridiculousness of their comedy style was invented for their own amusement, and all the better if some people laughed on the right part of the joke. Some people have complained that the show feels dated now. Well, yes, that's becoming true with each passing year, but these sketches are still heaps less topical than many other shows of this era. Many of the skits are based so much on ""verbal frotting"" (to quote Fry) that this factor is quite forgivable.The writing is typically very smart - it's certainly not exclusionary in the MENSA fashion, but viewers who excel at public debating, writing, or simply read their brains out will really enjoy the subtleties. The way the scripts are delivered is proof positive of just how smart Fry & Laurie are (perhaps a little too smart, since it was later revealed that both of them have dealt with severe mood problems). At the same time, the ""vox pops"" and occasional fits of completely random lines or sketches - Tony Inchpractice for one -  save the show from becoming snobbish. The on-stage music you find in some episodes is not variety show music but rather a parody or ""silly song,"" and even these portions are amusing in some way (Hugh Laurie really shines in these moments of fusing his music and comedy skills together).I will admit that the show is a mixed bag in some ways. I hardly laugh at all for the ""Tony & Control"" bits, but love so many other characters (check out the unapologetic take on ""Oprah"") that I choose to simply skip over the less funny parts instead of rip them apart in an Amazon review.

Maybe if you were back in that time period, and hadn't seen anything Python, you may have gotten a laugh out of it.  Now, the humor seems overly stale, forced, and is just bad.  I couldn't make it through the first episode without wanting to burn my library card.

Laurie is now a big star on American TV as the lead actor in ""House"", one of my favorite shows, and Fry is an occasional supporting player in ""Bones"", another of my can't miss broadcast offerings. On the product under discussion, you can see pretty much where they got their television start, beginning about 20 years ago as a sketch comedy duo. For my taste, the earliest work was the most enjoyable, and the other three DVD's were a bit less worthwhile as a whole. Many of the sketches are of interest mainly to people living in England at the time they were created. Some of the others suffer from my not being at the top of my game in comprehending British accents or slang. The great moments are indeed, worthy of that word. I did have many, many laughs, but for repeated enjoyment of the talents of these two fools, I recommend the ""Jeeves and Wooster"" box instead. Or, you could rent the human-actor version of ""101 Dalmatians"" and see Hugh Laurie as a bumbling burglar who makes his brief appearance into a real gem. Also see J.C.

1018372,A2Q65OXHQY32Q9,B000I2IP2K,Wodehouse Freak,"[69, 77]","OK, this is based off the UK release, so I can't give you any details on features, etc. Instead, I'll focus on the series.First, if you don't already know, A Bit of Fry and Laurie is a collection of sketches divided by mock interviews with the ""British public"" (always Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie). At times these sketches are of characters, whilst other times they are of the stars as themselves.Vox pops abound in every series of A Bit of Fry and Laurie, but there is a lack of regular, recurring characters (unless you count Fry and Laurie), unlike in Little Britain. In series one and two, there are Tony and Control of MI6, and the promotors of Uttoxeter, and the like, but if you've seen those two series, you'll understand why they were dropped from three and four. (I won't go into too much detail on one and two; I'll assume you've already seen them.)Series three introduces Mr Music (Hugh Laurie) who plays out the credits as Stephen Fry mixes up a strange, often disturbing, concoction. This bit, thankfully survives in the final series. Series three also marks a spike in music sketches (even Fry contributes his bit, as frightening as it seems in ""You, You, You"", etc.), including the popular ""There Ain't But One Way"", in which Laurie plays a Johnnie Cash-like singer with his brother Oren. I don't think you'll ever see Stephen Fry in a more unsophisticated role. By and large, this is my absolute favourite series, and my friends agree. Three hours just flew by.Series four is... a tad awkward. Apparently, the programme was moved from BBC2 to the more restrained BBC1 (I may be wrong on the channels), where creative control was hampered by the station. They introduced (often) unnecessary guest stars who did not do much -- most of the funny sketches were done without them. Thankfully, Mr Music and Fry's disturbing concoctions are back, and even more disturbing than before. And for you fans of Hugh Laurie, he does a music sketch every episode, including ""Little Girl"" and the ""Be Nice"" rap.All in all, this is a must for fans of Fry and Laurie, and an excellent introduction for new fans who are just discovering their comedy.",5,Soupy Twist,1179878400,"05 23, 2007",2007,2148,"['OK', 'based', 'off', 'UK', 'release', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'details', 'features', 'etc', 'Instead', ""'ll"", 'focus', 'series.First', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'Bit', 'Fry', 'Laurie', 'collection', 'sketches', 'divided', 'mock', 'interviews', 'British', 'public', 'always', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'times', 'sketches', 'are', 'characters', 'other', 'times', 'are', 'stars', 'themselves.Vox', 'pops', 'abound', 'series', 'A', 'Bit', 'Fry', 'Laurie', 'lack', 'regular', 'recurring', 'characters', 'count', 'Fry', 'Laurie', 'Little', 'Britain', 'series', 'one', 'two', 'are', 'Tony', 'Control', 'MI6', 'promotors', 'Uttoxeter', 'like', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'two', 'series', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'why', 'were', 'dropped', 'three', 'four', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'one', 'two', ""'ll"", 'assume', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'Series', 'three', 'introduces', 'Mr', 'Music', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'who', 'out', 'credits', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'mixes', 'up', 'strange', 'often', 'disturbing', 'concoction', 'bit', 'thankfully', 'final', 'series', 'Series', 'three', 'also', 'spike', 'music', 'sketches', 'even', 'Fry', 'bit', 'as', 'frightening', 'etc', 'including', 'popular', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'One', 'Way', 'Laurie', 'Johnnie', 'Cash-like', 'singer', 'brother', 'Oren', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'more', 'unsophisticated', 'role', 'large', 'absolute', 'favourite', 'series', 'friends', 'agree', 'Three', 'hours', 'just', 'flew', 'by.Series', 'four', 'tad', 'awkward', 'Apparently', 'programme', 'was', 'moved', 'BBC2', 'more', 'restrained', 'BBC1', 'may', 'be', 'wrong', 'channels', 'where', 'creative', 'control', 'was', 'hampered', 'station', 'introduced', 'often', 'unnecessary', 'guest', 'stars', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'much', 'most', 'funny', 'sketches', 'were', 'done', 'Thankfully', 'Mr', 'Music', 'Fry', 'disturbing', 'concoctions', 'are', 'back', 'even', 'more', 'disturbing', 'before', 'fans', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'music', 'sketch', 'episode', 'including', 'Little', 'Girl', 'Be', 'Nice', 'rap.All', 'must', 'fans', 'Fry', 'Laurie', 'excellent', 'introduction', 'new', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'discovering', 'comedy']",A Bit Of Fry And Laurie Complete Collection Series 1 - 4 Box [DVD] [Region2] Requires a Multi Region Player
