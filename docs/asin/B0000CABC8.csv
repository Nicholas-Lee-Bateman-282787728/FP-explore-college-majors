774516,ATOSQVSOA3D8Q,B0000CABC8,"Kathryn Pointon ""Kat""","[4, 10]","This film well i wasen't sure whether to buy it or not. I didn't like the 3rd, not enough going on in it but i loved the 1st and second beethoven. Since the characters have changed, the film has got from bad good to bad. I liked what was going on in the 1st and second, and the characters they were just right for it. Then the 3rd was ruined by the characters therefore should of kept the same or not made the 3rdat all. Now i'm not so sure about the 4th so if youv'e seen the same as me and are very unsure, hire the 4th. Now the characters names are changed thats a bit stupid unless beethoven was given away or someone was looking after him but the characters have all got different names to the 1st and second like emily the little girl is now sara and sara[daveigh chase] would of suited as an older version of emily. 3 different girls. Literally daveigh chase has played all the way through this film and i love it, shes a good actress and i believe that any film with a good star in that you like, is going to be a good film. Her and her uncle act mostly and the sheriff along with garett the boy mainly, i think maybe they changed the whole storyline from the 2nd beethoven.",5,"BUY 1,2 AND 5.",1104192000,"12 28, 2004",2004,1182,"['film', 'well', 'i', 'wase', ""n't"", 'sure', 'buy', 'not', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', '3rd', 'not', 'enough', 'going', 'loved', '1st', 'second', 'beethoven', 'characters', 'have', 'changed', 'film', 'got', 'bad', 'good', 'bad', 'liked', 'what', 'was', 'going', '1st', 'second', 'characters', 'were', 'just', 'right', 'Then', '3rd', 'was', 'ruined', 'characters', 'therefore', 'should', 'kept', 'same', 'not', 'made', '3rdat', 'Now', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', '4th', 'so', 'youv', 'e', 'seen', 'same', 'are', 'very', 'unsure', 'hire', '4th', 'Now', 'characters', 'names', 'are', 'changed', 'thats', 'bit', 'stupid', 'beethoven', 'was', 'given', 'away', 'someone', 'was', 'looking', 'characters', 'have', 'got', 'different', 'names', '1st', 'second', 'emily', 'little', 'girl', 'now', 'sara', 'sara', '[', 'daveigh', 'chase', ']', 'would', 'suited', 'older', 'version', 'emily', '3', 'different', 'girls', 'Literally', 'daveigh', 'chase', 'played', 'way', 'film', 'i', 'love', 'good', 'actress', 'i', 'believe', 'film', 'good', 'star', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'film', 'uncle', 'act', 'mostly', 'sheriff', 'garett', 'boy', 'mainly', 'i', 'think', 'maybe', 'changed', 'whole', 'storyline', '2nd', 'beethoven']",N/A

We also watched that over and over again. Now with this Beethoven's 5th they are thrilled to have another movie to add to their favorite movies. Personally, I still like the original Beethoven with Charles Grodin the very best. It is a good thing that these movies are entertaining to all ages since I have to watch them over and over.",5,Kids love it.,1379203200,"09 15, 2013",2013,470,"['love', 'original', 'Beethoven', 'have', 'watched', 'over', 'again', 'Then', 'got', 'Beethoven', '2nd', 'loved', 'one', 'too', 'also', 'watched', 'over', 'again', 'Now', 'Beethoven', '5th', 'are', 'thrilled', 'have', 'movie', 'add', 'favorite', 'movies', 'Personally', 'still', 'original', 'Beethoven', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'very', 'best', 'good', 'thing', 'movies', 'are', 'entertaining', 'ages', 'have', 'watch', 'over', 'over']",N/A
