948579,A3PEV8SRSAQ45H,B000BR9SA0,Admiral Kenobi,"[2, 3]","This was by far the best of the three seasons this show ran. Upon first airing - this show was going to be a ""Star Trek"" under water. The sub was a research and exploration vessel and episodes were written to teach the viewers with the clips at the end. The developing interactions between the crew members were not unlike that of the well written ""Trek"" series.Shamefully, the producers of this show wanted to focus on demographics and tailor the show to attract different viewers. The largest blunder was putting so much emphasis on the Lucas character as they attempted to make him the ""heartthrob"" of the show and get the teenage girls to watch simply so they can swoon over him. Unfortunately, he was not a pivotal character and focusing on him ruined the show as it rapidly was ""kiddiefied"".The second season abandoned the educational angle and took on a more science fiction theme - sadly it failed as it was handled poorly. They tried to make it more ""Trek"" and got a tradgedy more in the lines of Blake's 7 (a good show itself but for the dark themes). The third season drove the final stake in Seaquest's heart as it took a totally different path. Now, it's no longer a ship of exploration but one of war. It was no surprise the show was finally canceled and put out of its suffering.Drastic cast changes also contributed to the show's demise. Seaquest producers broke the unwritten, Golden rule - never kill off major cast members (making them mysteriously disappear with no explanation is just as bad). Losing your captain is just as bad and was a sizable nail in the coffin.In summary, Seaquest DSV - Season 1 is the only one worth preserving - Seasons 2 and 3 will come out eventually, I will consider getting 2 if not just for the fianl episode with the Hyberions (decent looking aliens) but I do not want the 3rd season - it's pathetic.To the powers that be: if a series is to be remade - this one deserves it. I would recommend remaking the first season with its format intact and then NOT deviating from it. Introduce some sci-fi but in little doses - we all love that. Get the original crew if possible and leave it intact.",5,Seaquest:: promising series but was trashed.,1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,2142,"['was', 'far', 'best', 'three', 'seasons', 'show', 'ran', 'first', 'airing', 'show', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Star', 'Trek', 'water', 'sub', 'was', 'research', 'exploration', 'vessel', 'episodes', 'were', 'written', 'teach', 'viewers', 'clips', 'end', 'developing', 'interactions', 'crew', 'members', 'were', 'not', 'well', 'written', 'Trek', 'series.Shamefully', 'producers', 'show', 'wanted', 'focus', 'demographics', 'tailor', 'show', 'attract', 'different', 'viewers', 'largest', 'blunder', 'was', 'putting', 'so', 'much', 'emphasis', 'Lucas', 'character', 'attempted', 'make', 'heartthrob', 'show', 'get', 'teenage', 'girls', 'watch', 'simply', 'can', 'swoon', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'not', 'pivotal', 'character', 'focusing', 'ruined', 'show', 'rapidly', 'was', 'kiddiefied', '.The', 'second', 'season', 'abandoned', 'educational', 'angle', 'took', 'more', 'science', 'fiction', 'theme', 'sadly', 'failed', 'was', 'handled', 'poorly', 'tried', 'make', 'more', 'Trek', 'got', 'tradgedy', 'more', 'lines', 'Blake', '7', 'good', 'show', 'dark', 'themes', 'third', 'season', 'drove', 'final', 'stake', 'Seaquest', 'heart', 'took', 'totally', 'different', 'path', 'Now', 'no', 'longer', 'ship', 'exploration', 'one', 'war', 'was', 'surprise', 'show', 'was', 'finally', 'canceled', 'put', 'suffering.Drastic', 'cast', 'changes', 'also', 'contributed', 'show', 'demise', 'Seaquest', 'producers', 'broke', 'unwritten', 'Golden', 'rule', 'never', 'kill', 'off', 'major', 'cast', 'members', 'making', 'mysteriously', 'disappear', 'explanation', 'just', 'bad', 'Losing', 'captain', 'just', 'bad', 'was', 'sizable', 'nail', 'coffin.In', 'summary', 'Seaquest', 'DSV', 'Season', '1', 'only', 'one', 'worth', 'preserving', 'Seasons', '2', '3', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'eventually', 'will', 'consider', 'getting', '2', 'not', 'just', 'fianl', 'episode', 'Hyberions', 'decent', 'looking', 'aliens', 'do', 'not', 'want', '3rd', 'season', 'powers', 'be', 'series', 'be', 'remade', 'one', 'would', 'recommend', 'remaking', 'first', 'season', 'format', 'intact', 'then', 'NOT', 'deviating', 'Introduce', 'sci-fi', 'little', 'doses', 'love', 'Get', 'original', 'crew', 'possible', 'leave', 'intact']",SeaQuest DSV: Season One

The updating is similar to the 60's series, but this show is more high tech and eco sounding. The ship seem to look akin to the Seaview. That where the updating ends.Voyage's crew was mainly men. The second in command is a woman and so is the ship's Doctor, which parelleled Star Trek Next Generation casting .

I managed to get a bootleg copy of the series, but unfortunately, when I had to switch DVD players, the new machine wouldn't play those discs.  Now I can finally get a REAL SET!!!  I'm already putting in my preorder!The series begins in the year 2018, when Earth has turned to the oceans in a spirit of exploration, cooperation, and commercial exploitation, with a UN-type organization called the UEO (United Earth Oceans) overseeing things. But to keep the peace, they have built an amazingly advanced submarine as a science and peacekeeping vessel, the seaQuest.  Unfortunately, the sub's first captain proved to be a lunatic, and she was relieved of command. 18 months subsequent, the UEO manages to recruit seaQuest's original designer, Nathan Bridger to command seaQuest.Starring 'Jaws' veteran Roy Schieder as Captain Nathan Bridger, and Jonathan Brandis (may he rest in peace) as teenage genius Lucas Wolenczak, among several other great actors and characters, as well as a dolphin which can talk with the use of a computer program.The brainchild of movie director-great Steven Spielberg, this series had amazing potential, as something of an underwater Star Trek (which may be why I like this show so much, as I'm a hard-core Trekker), but unfortunately, even back in the early 90's people were already beginning to drift away from quality stories and drifting in the directions of the horrible reality shows that now plague our society.I'm eager to add this series to my collection, and fully intend to add the other two seasons as well.

948593,A3RRBPUGD7UOSP,B000BR9SA0,"chemikalguy ""chemikalguy""","[82, 83]","I have to admit, I was a bit frustrated when reading posted reviews. All of the reviews I read were for the show, not this release. In fact, loads of them had been posted before the DVDs were even released. I wanted to read a review someone had written having actually watched these DVDs. So, when I got the DVD as a gift, I watched all the episodes, and decided to write my own. Here goes.I, like the other reviewers, really enjoyed this series. It was my favorite show when it was on, and I still watch VHS copies I made of it when it was on. In fact, I probably enjoyed it more than many of the other reviewers here.  Let me 'splain. I watched this show. I enjoyed it. I went to college and studied Marine Biology and Oceanography. I started keeping reef aquaria. I learned how to use computer-aided design software and designed my own undersea habitats and minisubs. I became a certified SCUBA diver. I'm a big fan of Bob Ballard. See what I mean?Anyway, for those of you who don't know the series, it's set in the near future when mankind has colonized the oceans. There are farms, power plants, resorts, even prisons in, on and under the oceans. And with all this expansion comes some strife. The SeaQuest was built as a deterrent for those who might seek to wreak havok in the seas. Over time, the ship has taken on scientific research responsibilities as well. Nice plot. One thing I always liked is that the characters were 'fleshed out' well. They seemed like real people. You got to know them, and that's something I really like. Something else I found about this show is that the characters always do 'the right thing'. Even when it's not popular, or could get them killed. Like not counter-attacking an aggressor sub, but instead evacuating injured people from a damaged power station.As far as this DVD set goes, there are four of disks that contain a total of 23 episodes. I'd have to say that these first season episodes are excellent, although after getting the box set, I started trying to find a couple of my favorite episodes, only to find that they were from the second season. I guess I'll have to wait to watch them again.The reason that I didn't give this set 5 stars is that the bonus features are very sparse.  There are really only a few deleted scenes from about a third of the episodes, which don't really add anything to them. I had hoped for something cool, like crew bios, schematic layouts of the ship, something. Anything! I was told by a studio insider that originally, this set was slated for release sometime in 2006, but that they were pushed to try and make the 2005 holiday season. I guess they decided to leave out any additional bonus features in order to try their best to make it. They ended up missing it by one day, releasing on Dec. 26.Another reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it seemed a bit, well, cheap. The disks are double-sided, and have two or three episodes per side. I'm a big fan of pictures and stuff being printed on the top of my DVDs. You know, pictures of the ship, the crew, the dolphin named Darwin, anything. I just think it's the details that make it seem 'classy'. Call me weird. I accept that.The DVD transfer is as good as can be expected from a show that aired in 1993. The video quality is far better than those bootlegs that have been available on auction sites for several years. It's much better than the VHS recordings I've been holding onto for the last twelve years. The audio is also quite good. It's even in Dolby Digital 2.0, which was a pleasant surprise.

""seaQuest DSV"" is one of those shows.In 1993 NBC did a show about a super-sub in the near future... starring Roy Scheider (""Jaws"", ""Blue Thunder""), Don Franklin, Stacy Haiduk (""Luther the Geek"") and the late Jonathan Brandis. While it does have a decided ecological, liberal slant to the stories - save the whales, pollution in the oceans, underwater mining - it is exceptional SF. Probably the first modern series to explore the undersea world.Airing on Sunday nights, ""seaQuest DSV"" kicked SF into the modern age... this wasn't some SF series about aliens in the far future; it was about what could possibly happen just around the corner.The first season of ""seaQuest"" is very much worth it... the episodes may have been hit or miss, but there was an overall beauty to the scripts and the acting.Don't bother with seasons 2 or 3... at the end of season 1, NBC decided that since it wasn't getting the numbers it wanted, it would go with a ""younger, sexier cast"" (as if you could get either without Stacy Haiduk), and fired four of the cast members - the second season introduced psychics, genetically-engineered clones, aliens and space battles. The stories in the following seasons were of the Berman type (poorly written).The first season is definitely worth it - there was some great writing in there (co-produced by Steven Speilberg), and pretty decent acting. Good plots. Nice tension.

As a hard-core sci-fi fanatic, I enjoyed the fresh perspective this brought to the genre, exploring the fantastic world of the oceans, rather than deep space. While sometimes a little heavy on environmetal issues, this futuristic underwater saga had a good heart, and a strong cast, particularly in the first season. Roy Scheider shines as the unwilling captain (an amusing turn after his understandably hydrophobic role in 'Jaws'), and the role generally filled by the requisite alien is instead filled by a dolphin rigged with an English communication device. Often pigeonholed as simply Star Trek: TNG under water, I think this show actually carried itself to inventive heights of storytelling and interpersonal interraction. The mentor/father/son relationship developed between Captain Bridger and Lucas, the ship's 16-yr.-old computer genius, was done particularly well, and is a type of relationship too often overlooked in most recent entertainment. I personally particularly enjoy the performance of Ted Raimi as Lt. jg. Tim O'Neill, the serious-but-jumpy, multi-linguistic communications officer.

Having been a big ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" fan, I was surprised. Talking dolphins and wise-guy teens seemed too reminiscent of ""Lost in Space"" and ""Star Trek:TNG"" with Will Robinson and Wesley Crusher. However, I caught the re-runs on the Sci-fi Channel, and actually got into it. Some. But the show was neither fish nor fowl- it had science fiction and espionage elements, but it also had ghost stories, too. Obviously Roy Scheider got tired of this, and got out in the third season to be replaced by Michael Ironside.The whole show did a 180 when Ironside came on board. The easy going atmosphere under Scheider was replaced with a hard nosed military attitude. Some of the best stories were in the third season, including one where the SeaQuest gets involved in the Cuban Missle Crisis.The biggest problem was the show started to center around boy genius Brandeis. It became stories of a boy and his dolphin, or a boy, his dolphin, and his developing hormones as he oogled older female crew members.  I wouldn't be surprised if that's one reason Scheider chucked his role overboard.The SeaQuest itself was an oddly designed boat (submarines are considered boats, not ships). It never really grabbed me, either. I built a model of it, and still think it has no real ""grace"" to it, unlike VTTBOTS's Seaview.Incongruous as it may seem, I still give it 4 stars, because I think the producers had their heart in the right place.

This show's first season was its' best (what many ""purist"" fans consider its' *only* season, before it turned into 21 Jump Street).  It features, among others, the wonderful Roy Scheider as Nathan Bridger, captain of the seaQuest, Stephanie Beecham as Dr. Kristen Westphalen, Ted Raimi as Communications Officer/Translator Tim O'Neil and the late Jonathan Brandis as the young genius Lucas who bonds with Bridger and assists both of them in emotional healing.  And of course, the dolphin, Darwin, an appealing character himself, who talked, with the help of Lucas' ingenious computer program and vocorder. (Never mind that the dolphin was actually mechanical; it worked.  I challenge anyone not to smile every time that dolphin showed up!) The cast was unusually competent and possessed wonderful chemistry and appeal together. They also managed to attract some top-notch guest stars, including Charleton Heston, William Shatner, Jonathan Banks, etc., no doubt due to the fact that Spielberg's name was still attached to the project at this time.This show actually holds up quite well, considering the fact that it was being made at a time before the internet, before 9/11,when computers still took up a room.  It was futuristic, but still maintained a nice familial feel with sweet shows, science fiction, intelligent shows, and shows that still speak to issues of today, such as the episode Whale Song, which dealt with retaliation from activists for illegal whaling. (one of my favorites)The only drawback to watching this collection of dvds is the bittersweet sense of nostalgia I have when I see them.  After this season, nothing was ever the same, everyone over 30 was removed from the cast list (except for Scheider, who became so fed up with the banality of the eps that he asked to leave), and the sense of familial bonding, particularly between Bridger and Lucas, was lost forever.Not to mention that watching the young, vibrant, natural, oh-so-likable and beguiling Brandis, and knowing what his fate turned out to be, is heartbreaking.Highly recommended, very satisfying entertainmnet.

Young ""Jeff""","[1, 1]","I must admit I first experienced Seaquest DSV on Netlix (am I allowed to say that here on Amazon?), but very quickly after just a couple of episodes realized that I wanted to buy this on DVD and add it to my collection.  This is one of those series that is a hidden gem that somehow I missed when it was on back in the early 90's.  If you are a fan of science fiction or even just a fan of Roy Schieder then you will enjoy this series.I think I saw another reviewer say something like this is Star Trek under water and I have to say that's a really accurate description.  There is a great deal of the human element involved in these episodes and there is a ecological undertone to many episodes as well expressed with an attitude of innocence that is rather charming.Perhaps one other part of this series that struck a chord with me is what I would call the ""Galaxy Quest"" intro.

948609,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000BR9SA0,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[5, 5]","SeaQuest DSV - Season 1 brings the audience to the depths of the ocean, a place just as foreign as distant galaxies.  In the light of Abyss (1989), it might have been a good decision.  However, the initial criticism of SeaQuest DSV promised a disastrous science fiction tale that brought to mind the notion of sinking ships.  The problems started before the shooting of the TV series when producers and other involved parties could not come to a mutual agreement on the show.  SeaQuest might never have been green lit if it was not for Steven Spielberg's interest in the project, as he also served as executive producer.  With all the tumult around the show including an earthquake, it is not odd that the series started off a little shaky, but once the sci-fi show had begun to air its underwater adventures in September of 1993, it received a warm welcoming by the American TV audience.The 90-minute pilot episode, To Be or Not To Be, rapidly introduced a futuristic society that has exhausted almost all of earth's resources.  In order to continue life on earth people sought themselves to the ocean floors where resources still existed.  However, it does not provide the safety and tranquility that many expect, as hostile factions seek to control areas of the earthly underwater domain.  To protect the people and help solve the conflicts under the sea level, Captain Nathan Bridger (Roy Schneider) takes command over his mammoth creation, the high tech mega-submarine SeaQuest DSV 4600.  SeaQuest DSV also provides interesting scientific notions together with each adventure, as it also portrays the importance of protecting the environment.Through the adventures of SeaQuest and a number of characters, the audience finds themselves experiencing a TV show that slightly resembles Star Trek.  Some of the episodes also bring back some notion of the old sci-fi show Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, but it clearly avoids the corny atmosphere of the 60s show.  What truly sticks out with the first season of SeaQuest DSV is the quality of the episodes, as it drastically deteriorates in the following two years.  It is clear that it had some potential, but after the final episode of the first season, the producers made it very difficult for the show to maintain the same level of quality.  Ultimately, this first season of SeaQuest offers a decent science fiction drama intended for television, but it never had the opportunity to reach greatness due to its struggling dynamics behind the screen.SeaQuest DSV - Season 1 has several interesting aspects incorporated into the show such as a strong concern for the environment and science.  It also has some good episodes with suspense and entertainment, but it does not reach greatness.  Yet, the show has its charm with the talking dolphin Darwin and its cast.  Now after the release of the first season, the viewers can avoid the massive amount of bootlegged copies on ebay, and instead get a chance to see all 23 episodes of season 1 with terrific sound and visual quality.",4,Only Season Worth Seeing...,1136764800,"01 9, 2006",2006,3030,"['SeaQuest', 'DSV', 'Season', '1', 'audience', 'depths', 'ocean', 'place', 'just', 'as', 'foreign', 'distant', 'galaxies', 'light', 'Abyss', '1989', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'decision', 'However', 'initial', 'criticism', 'SeaQuest', 'DSV', 'promised', 'disastrous', 'science', 'fiction', 'tale', 'brought', 'mind', 'notion', 'sinking', 'ships', 'problems', 'started', 'shooting', 'TV', 'series', 'when', 'producers', 'other', 'involved', 'parties', 'could', 'not', 'come', 'mutual', 'agreement', 'show', 'SeaQuest', 'might', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'green', 'lit', 'was', 'not', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'interest', 'project', 'also', 'served', 'executive', 'producer', 'tumult', 'show', 'including', 'earthquake', 'not', 'odd', 'series', 'started', 'off', 'little', 'shaky', 'once', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'had', 'begun', 'air', 'underwater', 'adventures', 'September', '1993', 'received', 'warm', 'welcoming', 'American', 'TV', '90-minute', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Be', 'Not', 'Be', 'rapidly', 'introduced', 'futuristic', 'society', 'exhausted', 'almost', 'earth', 'resources', 'order', 'continue', 'life', 'earth', 'people', 'sought', 'ocean', 'floors', 'where', 'resources', 'still', 'existed', 'However', 'not', 'provide', 'safety', 'tranquility', 'many', 'expect', 'hostile', 'factions', 'seek', 'control', 'areas', 'earthly', 'underwater', 'domain', 'protect', 'people', 'help', 'solve', 'conflicts', 'sea', 'level', 'Captain', 'Nathan', 'Bridger', 'Roy', 'Schneider', 'command', 'mammoth', 'creation', 'high', 'tech', 'mega-submarine', 'SeaQuest', 'DSV', '4600', 'SeaQuest', 'DSV', 'also', 'interesting', 'scientific', 'notions', 'together', 'adventure', 'also', 'importance', 'protecting', 'environment.Through', 'adventures', 'SeaQuest', 'number', 'characters', 'audience', 'experiencing', 'TV', 'show', 'slightly', 'Star', 'Trek', 'episodes', 'also', 'bring', 'back', 'notion', 'old', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'Voyage', 'Bottom', 'Sea', 'clearly', 'corny', 'atmosphere', '60s', 'show', 'What', 'truly', 'out', 'first', 'season', 'SeaQuest', 'DSV', 'quality', 'episodes', 'drastically', 'following', 'two', 'years', 'clear', 'had', 'potential', 'final', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'producers', 'made', 'very', 'difficult', 'show', 'maintain', 'same', 'level', 'quality', 'Ultimately', 'first', 'season', 'SeaQuest', 'decent', 'science', 'fiction', 'drama', 'intended', 'television', 'never', 'had', 'opportunity', 'reach', 'greatness', 'due', 'struggling', 'dynamics', 'screen.SeaQuest', 'DSV', 'Season', '1', 'several', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'incorporated', 'show', 'such', 'strong', 'concern', 'environment', 'science', 'also', 'good', 'episodes', 'suspense', 'entertainment', 'not', 'reach', 'greatness', 'show', 'charm', 'talking', 'dolphin', 'Darwin', 'cast', 'Now', 'release', 'first', 'season', 'viewers', 'can', 'avoid', 'massive', 'amount', 'bootlegged', 'copies', 'ebay', 'instead', 'get', 'chance', 'see', '23', 'episodes', 'season', '1', 'terrific', 'sound', 'visual', 'quality']",SeaQuest DSV: Season One

My son suggested the series might have been inspired by another TV series from thirty years earlier, Irwin Allen's Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. I don't know if that's the case or not, but there are certainly some basic similarities.The first season cast were all spot-on in their roles, including Jonathan Brandis as the quirky young genius; Don Franklin and Stacy Haiduk as the by-the-book officers; John D'Aquino as the resident scoundrel with a penchant for getting himself and his shipmates into trouble; Royce Applegate as Bridger's old friend and security chief; Stephanie Beacham as the SeaQuest's chief science officer; and Darwin the ""talking"" dolphin.Unfortunately, some of those cast members departed and the series jumped the shark at the beginning of the second season.

948620,AX9ZYSNJKJJK6,B000BR9SA0,R. Wolfe,"[1, 4]","I personally did not watch the show much when it first came out, finding it a bit light and lacking in ""edginess,"" if you know what I mean.  I was psyched about the more science-y details (a ship with water-filled corridors for a dolphin shipmate, cross-species communication, cool sets, etc.).  I did watch it in re-runs much later on the Sci-Fi Channel and thought then that I was an absolute idiot for not just sticking with it the first time around.  Especially when it got the the third season.  (I did the same thing with Earth:2, a show I would put on par with this one quality-wise, though Earth:2 never made it past its first, rather engrossing, season.)  When I think of SeaQuest DSV, I think of that third season first, and then my soft spot for the first season.  Though, as a real sci-fi nerd who has a soft spot for anything science-tinged and including any amount of special effects, I have to say I really enjoyed this series from start to finish.  I personally was pretty psyched about the second-season ending alien story arc with Luke Skywalker along for the ride, though some posters here apparently felt it was a bit over the top.  Me like sci fi . . .Anyway, if you're like me and have even been bottom-feeding off cheap DVD sets of shows like Starhunter just because you can't resist anything with a spaceship and a CGI budget of any size at all, boy are you in for a treat with this show.  It's underwater and it even has spaceships (kind of).  This show was done with vision, good character actors, a major network budget, and actual story arcs in mind.  I do believe this was a brainchild of the producer who eventually brought us the beloved Farscape series.  Though that level of quirky genious is not present in this show (it was, after all, 7 or 8 PM Sunday night NBC fare, if I remember correctly), you get a feeling there is some real loving work crafted into SeaQuest that is not present in a lot of genre work.  Is this worth your sci-fi dollar?  Yes, it is.  While not on the same level (in my mind) as epics like Babylon 5 (I am a JMS devotee) or even Farscape, it competes with the last few years of Start Trek:TNG and certainly holds its own against Voyager or Enterprise.  It certainly is not something like Battlestar Galactica as re-done on the Sci Fi Channel (it's just not that edgy).  But, there are a couple of characters  in here that you will enjoy spending time with and some eye-candy your CGI-craving brain will pull you toward.In fact, skip a couple of those cheaper sets that might get you more episodes for your dollar and sink the cash into SeaQuest DSV.

948622,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B000BR9SA0,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[4, 4]","""SeaQuest DSV"" originally aired in 1993 (I was in junior high at the time). A futuristic show set in the mid-21st century, it followed the adventures of the SeaQuest, a peacekeeping/ research submarine, and its crew, headed by Nathan Bridger (Roy Scheider from Jaws). Much like Star Trek, SeaQuest was devoted to the exploration of unknown worlds in the form of the mysteries of the ocean: black smokers and toxic bacteria, mysterious minerals on the ocean floor, and battling new viruses. The crew was also called to rescue missions and to defuse hostile situations between various factions.The first season was by far the best. Although elements of the supernatural and extraterrestrial were explored, it was done in a scientific, believable manner. Seasons two and three (dubbed ""Voyage to the bottom of the barrel"" by some critics) degenerated into a Xena-like world of Greek gods, giant robots, and aliens that had little to do with the dignity and wonder of the first season. The futuristic military and scientific technology was always believable, grounded in modern design and aesthetically beautiful (look at how much background detail is in the SeaQuest sets).The cast, headed by Roy Scheider, was a tightly-knit ensemble that was always believable as a military family: there were rivalries, outbursts, and crew romances,  but they all came together in times of need. First season standouts in addition to those above include Lieutenant Commander Katherine Hitchcock (Stacy Haiduk), Dr. Kristin Westphalen (Stephanie Beacham), resident linguist Tim O'Neill (Ted Raimi from Xena Warrior Princess, brother of Spiderman director Sam Raimi), and teenage prodigy Lucas Wolenczak (Jonathan Brandis, who committed suicide in 2003). Notable guest stars include William Shatner, Charlton Heston, and Seth Green. The show was fairly unique for the time in that multiethnic characters played major roles onboard the SeaQuest (Commander Jonathan Ford (Don Franklin) and Sensor Chief Miguel Ortiz (Marco Sanchez).Though the CGI special effects certainly appear dated thirteen years later, they were fairly advanced for the time (1993). The video quality on the DVD set is very good, much better than the original broadcasts. The soundtrack by John Debney brings to mind work by John Williams, and the show's writing (at least the first season) was a fine balance of humor, drama, and camaraderie that never felt stilted or forced.My collection has finally come full circle: I'm now the proud owner of the DVD set in addition to SeaQuest models, soundtrack, a T-shirt, all three paperbacks, a calendar, bookmark, and the video game. I'm so glad to finally own a DVD version of SeaQuest (I was left with disintegrating VHS tapes), and this version was worth the wait! The box design and cases are beautiful and functional. There are four two-sided discs housed in four slim cases listing each episode. Menus are very limited and give a brief summary for each episode, along with chapters. The only extra is half an hour of deleted scenes available for several episodes (filmed but not finished, no background music, etc., which explains the eerie silence) and closed captioning, but this is a beautiful tribute to one of my favourite TV series of all time.",5,Relive the magic of one of TV's most unique sci-fi series,1137196800,"01 14, 2006",2006,3252,"['SeaQuest', 'DSV', 'originally', 'aired', '1993', 'was', 'junior', 'high', 'time', 'futuristic', 'show', 'set', 'mid-21st', 'century', 'followed', 'adventures', 'SeaQuest', 'peacekeeping/', 'research', 'submarine', 'crew', 'headed', 'Nathan', 'Bridger', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'Jaws', 'Much', 'Star', 'Trek', 'SeaQuest', 'was', 'devoted', 'exploration', 'unknown', 'worlds', 'form', 'mysteries', 'ocean', 'black', 'smokers', 'toxic', 'bacteria', 'mysterious', 'minerals', 'ocean', 'floor', 'battling', 'new', 'viruses', 'crew', 'was', 'also', 'called', 'rescue', 'missions', 'defuse', 'hostile', 'situations', 'various', 'factions.The', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'far', 'best', 'elements', 'supernatural', 'extraterrestrial', 'were', 'explored', 'was', 'done', 'scientific', 'believable', 'manner', 'Seasons', 'two', 'three', 'dubbed', 'Voyage', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'critics', 'degenerated', 'Xena-like', 'world', 'Greek', 'gods', 'giant', 'robots', 'had', 'little', 'do', 'dignity', 'wonder', 'first', 'season', 'futuristic', 'military', 'scientific', 'technology', 'was', 'always', 'believable', 'grounded', 'modern', 'design', 'aesthetically', 'beautiful', 'look', 'how', 'much', 'background', 'detail', 'SeaQuest', 'sets', '.The', 'cast', 'headed', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'was', 'tightly-knit', 'ensemble', 'was', 'always', 'believable', 'military', 'family', 'were', 'rivalries', 'outbursts', 'crew', 'romances', 'came', 'together', 'times', 'need', 'First', 'season', 'standouts', 'addition', 'include', 'Lieutenant', 'Commander', 'Katherine', 'Hitchcock', 'Stacy', 'Haiduk', 'Dr.', 'Kristin', 'Westphalen', 'Stephanie', 'Beacham', 'resident', 'linguist', 'Tim', ""O'Neill"", 'Ted', 'Raimi', 'Xena', 'Warrior', 'Princess', 'brother', 'Spiderman', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'teenage', 'prodigy', 'Lucas', 'Wolenczak', 'Jonathan', 'Brandis', 'who', 'committed', 'suicide', '2003', 'Notable', 'guest', 'stars', 'include', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Seth', 'Green', 'show', 'was', 'fairly', 'unique', 'time', 'multiethnic', 'characters', 'played', 'major', 'roles', 'SeaQuest', 'Commander', 'Jonathan', 'Ford', 'Don', 'Franklin', 'Sensor', 'Chief', 'Miguel', 'Ortiz', 'Marco', 'Sanchez', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'certainly', 'appear', 'dated', 'thirteen', 'years', 'later', 'were', 'fairly', 'advanced', 'time', '1993', 'video', 'quality', 'DVD', 'set', 'very', 'good', 'much', 'better', 'original', 'broadcasts', 'soundtrack', 'John', 'Debney', 'mind', 'work', 'John', 'Williams', 'show', 'writing', 'least', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'fine', 'balance', 'humor', 'drama', 'camaraderie', 'never', 'felt', 'stilted', 'forced.My', 'collection', 'finally', 'come', 'full', 'circle', ""'m"", 'now', 'proud', 'owner', 'DVD', 'set', 'addition', 'SeaQuest', 'models', 'soundtrack', 'T-shirt', 'three', 'paperbacks', 'calendar', 'bookmark', 'video', 'game', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'finally', 'own', 'DVD', 'version', 'SeaQuest', 'was', 'left', 'disintegrating', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'version', 'was', 'worth', 'wait', 'box', 'design', 'cases', 'are', 'beautiful', 'functional', 'are', 'four', 'two-sided', 'discs', 'housed', 'four', 'slim', 'cases', 'listing', 'episode', 'are', 'very', 'limited', 'give', 'brief', 'summary', 'episode', 'chapters', 'only', 'extra', 'hour', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'available', 'several', 'episodes', 'filmed', 'not', 'finished', 'background', 'music', 'etc.', 'eerie', 'silence', 'closed', 'captioning', 'beautiful', 'tribute', 'one', 'favourite', 'TV', 'series', 'time']",SeaQuest DSV: Season One

Smith ""ltcolkiranerys""","[4, 6]","SeaQuest was one of my favorite shows from the day it premiered on TV, and now that I have the opportunity to own all the episodes on DVD, I'm ecstatic!This wonderful show stars Roy Scheider as Nathan Bridger, who is convinced to return to the SeaQuest after his protege (and former SeaQuest captain) Marilyn Stark (former Charlie's Angel Shelley Hack) goes mad and hires a crew of mercenaries to lay waste to not only her former command, but to the underwater colonies administered by the United Earth Oceans Organization (UEO).  Later on, Bridger begins to take on a more active role as Captain of the SeaQuest.Don Franklin was a good choice for the role of Nathan's second-in-command, Jonathan Ford.  He plays Ford with the right mixture of dry wit and humor, and he does a great job of it.My favorite member of the cast, however, was the late Jonathan Brandis as Lucas Wolenczak, the young computer genius who designed the system that allows Bridger to communicate verbally with Darwin, a Navy-trained dolphin who was rescued by Bridger after having been caught in a tuna net.  Placed on SeaQuest by his father, Lucas is resentful at first, but gradually warms up to the crew.  I was saddened to hear of young Brandis's death a few years ago; he has been, and still is, among my favorite actors.As for extras, there aren't any except for deleted scenes and a plot summary for each episode in the episode guide.  I'm not too terribly disappointed, though; I hate commentary tracks (aside from the fact that they're distracting, I invariably end up turning on the subtitles so I can know what's going on in the episode), and extras can be a distraction anyway.One thing that I like most about the SeaQuest 1st Season DVD set, though, is the fact that they kept Bob Ballard's educational spots in the end credits.  Normally I dislike it when the end credits are pushed off to one side to make room for some talking head to bring up the latest news headlines, but because Ballard brings up topics that are informative (and also because he's not a Talking Head, lol), I like listening to him.All in all, I would definitely recommend this DVD set, even to those who are not fans, or those who might have been too young to watch SeaQuest back when it was on.",5,SeaQuest Lives On,1144022400,"04 3, 2006",2006,2255,"['SeaQuest', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'day', 'premiered', 'TV', 'now', 'have', 'opportunity', 'own', 'episodes', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'ecstatic', 'wonderful', 'show', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'Nathan', 'Bridger', 'who', 'convinced', 'return', 'SeaQuest', 'protege', 'former', 'SeaQuest', 'captain', 'Marilyn', 'Stark', 'former', 'Charlie', 'Angel', 'Shelley', 'Hack', 'mad', 'crew', 'mercenaries', 'lay', 'waste', 'not', 'only', 'former', 'command', 'underwater', 'colonies', 'administered', 'United', 'Earth', 'Oceans', 'Organization', 'UEO', 'Later', 'Bridger', 'take', 'more', 'active', 'role', 'Captain', 'SeaQuest.Don', 'Franklin', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'role', 'Nathan', 'second-in-command', 'Jonathan', 'Ford', 'Ford', 'right', 'mixture', 'dry', 'wit', 'humor', 'great', 'job', 'it.My', 'favorite', 'member', 'cast', 'however', 'was', 'late', 'Jonathan', 'Brandis', 'Lucas', 'Wolenczak', 'young', 'computer', 'genius', 'who', 'designed', 'system', 'Bridger', 'communicate', 'verbally', 'Darwin', 'Navy-trained', 'dolphin', 'who', 'was', 'rescued', 'Bridger', 'having', 'been', 'caught', 'tuna', 'net', 'Placed', 'SeaQuest', 'father', 'Lucas', 'resentful', 'first', 'gradually', 'up', 'crew', 'was', 'saddened', 'hear', 'young', 'Brandis', 'death', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'been', 'still', 'favorite', 'actors.As', 'extras', 'are', ""n't"", 'except', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'plot', 'summary', 'episode', 'episode', 'guide', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'terribly', 'disappointed', 'hate', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'aside', 'fact', ""'re"", 'distracting', 'invariably', 'end', 'up', 'turning', 'subtitles', 'can', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'episode', 'extras', 'can', 'be', 'distraction', 'anyway.One', 'thing', 'like', 'most', 'SeaQuest', '1st', 'Season', 'DVD', 'set', 'fact', 'kept', 'Bob', 'Ballard', 'educational', 'spots', 'end', 'credits', 'Normally', 'dislike', 'when', 'end', 'credits', 'are', 'pushed', 'one', 'side', 'make', 'room', 'talking', 'head', 'bring', 'up', 'latest', 'news', 'headlines', 'because', 'Ballard', 'up', 'topics', 'are', 'informative', 'also', 'not', 'Talking', 'Head', 'lol', 'like', 'listening', 'him.All', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'set', 'even', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'fans', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'young', 'watch', 'SeaQuest', 'back', 'when', 'was']",SeaQuest DSV: Season One

Those were notoriouly difficult then, and there was a rumor that production was slowed because they didn't have the computing power to do a sequence lasting more than about 15 seconds.But the best fun was Bridger and Westphalen (Scheider and Beacham having a grand time), and the handsome crew of Ford, Lucas, O'Neill, Ortiz, (and later Brody and Piccolo -- what was their target audience?) with stunt guest stars Mark Hamill and Kent Cord.I personally have worn out my VCR tape of the pilot, with Shelley Hack chewing the hell out of the hull scenery, so I am looking forward to seeing the DVD quality.",4,Waiting to see,1131494400,"11 9, 2005",2005,972,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'then', 'slowly', 'fell', '60', 'predecessor', ""'Voyage"", 'Bottom', 'Sea', 'silly', 'storylines', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'undersea', 'exploration', 'quixoticaly', 'lot', 'do', 'space', 'aliens.I', 'wonder', 'delayed', 'releasing', 'long', 'were', 'considering', 'redoing', 'undersea', 'CGI', 'effects', 'were', 'notoriouly', 'difficult', 'then', 'there', 'was', 'rumor', 'production', 'was', 'slowed', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'computing', 'power', 'do', 'sequence', 'lasting', 'more', 'about', '15', 'seconds.But', 'best', 'fun', 'was', 'Bridger', 'Westphalen', 'Scheider', 'Beacham', 'having', 'grand', 'time', 'handsome', 'crew', 'Ford', 'Lucas', ""O'Neill"", 'Ortiz', 'later', 'Brody', 'Piccolo', 'what', 'was', 'target', 'audience', 'stunt', 'guest', 'stars', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'Kent', 'Cord.I', 'personally', 'have', 'worn', 'out', 'VCR', 'tape', 'pilot', 'Shelley', 'Hack', 'chewing', 'hell', 'hull', 'scenery', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'quality']",SeaQuest DSV: Season One

948632,A2RIJ4R7UX8JPS,B000BR9SA0,"Violet ""sweetviolet79""","[6, 6]","In regard to the first season, the plot was intelligent, entertaining and besides the x-files... it was also the only good thing on tv. The show still has a cult following, with all-day marathons occasionally showing up on tv.One of highlights of this series, is the heart-warming interaction between the fatherly Nathen Bridger & Lucas Wolenczak, who's parents have sent him away to board the Seaquest DSV (Deep Submergence Vehicle). There is also the strong and unusual friendship between Lucas Wolenczak and Darwin the talking dolphin.The following seasons were dumbed down somewhat and less unique, appearing to have barrowed their plots from from myths, urban legends and even paranormal phenomena.From the beginning, the series had already been futuristic, taking place around 2012 but the final season took the SeaQuest into outer space where the crew dissapeared until 2032. In a show that emphisized the ocean as the ""final frontier"", the leap into space created an entirely new television series with none of the original charm.I highly recomend the first series to anyone of any age. I'd recommend the following seasons to die-hard SeaQuest fans and if you're crazy for anything starring the former Jedi Mark Hammill, maybe you'll enjoy 2032. Mark Hammill had a re-occurring role in the final season.",5,I loved this show!,1157241600,"09 3, 2006",2006,1311,"['regard', 'first', 'season', 'plot', 'was', 'intelligent', 'entertaining', 'x-files', 'was', 'also', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'tv', 'show', 'still', 'cult', 'following', 'all-day', 'marathons', 'occasionally', 'showing', 'up', 'tv.One', 'highlights', 'series', 'heart-warming', 'interaction', 'fatherly', 'Nathen', 'Bridger', 'Lucas', 'Wolenczak', 'who', 'parents', 'have', 'sent', 'away', 'board', 'Seaquest', 'DSV', 'Deep', 'Submergence', 'Vehicle', 'also', 'strong', 'unusual', 'friendship', 'Lucas', 'Wolenczak', 'Darwin', 'talking', 'dolphin.The', 'following', 'seasons', 'were', 'dumbed', 'down', 'somewhat', 'less', 'unique', 'appearing', 'have', 'barrowed', 'plots', 'myths', 'urban', 'legends', 'even', 'paranormal', 'beginning', 'series', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'futuristic', 'taking', 'place', '2012', 'final', 'season', 'took', 'SeaQuest', 'outer', 'space', 'where', 'crew', 'dissapeared', '2032', 'show', 'emphisized', 'ocean', 'final', 'frontier', 'leap', 'space', 'created', 'entirely', 'new', 'television', 'series', 'none', 'original', 'charm.I', 'highly', 'recomend', 'first', 'series', 'anyone', 'age', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'following', 'seasons', 'die-hard', 'SeaQuest', 'fans', ""'re"", 'crazy', 'anything', 'starring', 'former', 'Jedi', 'Mark', 'Hammill', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', '2032', 'Mark', 'Hammill', 'had', 're-occurring', 'role', 'final', 'season']",SeaQuest DSV: Season One
