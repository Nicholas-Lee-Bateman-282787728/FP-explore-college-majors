However, this is an extremely 'fun' movie.  If you're expecting the Joseph Gordon-Levitt from Brick, Inception, Looper, or The Dark Knight Rises, you might be disappointed.  If you're expecting the Joseph Gordon-Levitt from GI Joe, you might be pleasantly surprised. Really, this movie is a PG-13 Crank mixed with a contemporary Gleaming the Cube for urban cyclists. If that description sounds like something you'd want to watch, I think you'll have a good time with this movie.  If that just sounds terrible to you, you're a boring person who needs to loosen up and have some fun.Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character development in this movie begins and ends with &#34;I like to ride a bicycle fast and recklessly.&#34; Some movies would try to tack on more levels of character development here, but Premium Rush only gives a quick nod to the fact that he has a life beyond his bike.  But he is extremely charming while riding said bike. Michael Shannon is the perfect dirty cop.  Again, you don't need much character development here, he's channeling every dirty cop you've seen in another movie. And he's the perfect actor for it; he just has that creepy vibe you might recognize from his time on Boardwalk Empire, it's like the off-putting delivery of Willem Dafoe in Boondock Saints mixed with the poor impulse control of Gary Oldman in Leon/The Professional.  And there's some other people who like to ride bikes, or give people on bikes stuff, or chase people on bikes.  Really, the only other person you'll likely remember after the movie is over is Aasif Mandvi AKA that guy from The Daily Show (and Jericho, remember that show?).This is a chase movie, with wackiness and bike culture aplenty. And a plot point that either requires a previous understanding of hawala or a willingness to just overlook the need to understand it, as the movie is moving too quickly to stop and really explain that.  If you want to watch Joseph Gordon-Levitt be charming, ride a bike, and thwart Michael Shannon with his traffic predicting brain powers, this is the perfect movie for you.  If you're the kind of person who gets hung up on films needing a 'plot' and 'character development', you might want to sit this one out.  But you really should try and join us in the first group--sometimes you just need to turn off your brain to have a fun time.",4,The most apt word to describe this movie is 'fun',1358121600,"01 14, 2013",2013,2440,"[""'smart"", 'movie', 'No', 'clever', 'times', 'doubt', ""'re"", 'going', 'tax', 'brain', 'cells', 'However', 'extremely', ""'fun"", 'movie', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Brick', 'Inception', 'Looper', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'GI', 'Joe', 'might', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Really', 'movie', 'PG-13', 'Crank', 'mixed', 'contemporary', 'Gleaming', 'Cube', 'urban', 'cyclists', 'description', 'something', ""'d"", 'want', 'watch', 'think', ""'ll"", 'have', 'good', 'time', 'movie', 'just', 'terrible', ""'re"", 'boring', 'person', 'who', 'loosen', 'up', 'have', 'fun.Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'character', 'development', 'movie', '34', 'like', 'ride', 'bicycle', 'fast', 'recklessly.', '34', 'movies', 'would', 'try', 'tack', 'more', 'levels', 'character', 'development', 'here', 'Premium', 'Rush', 'only', 'quick', 'nod', 'fact', 'life', 'bike', 'extremely', 'charming', 'riding', 'said', 'bike', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'perfect', 'dirty', 'cop', 'Again', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'much', 'character', 'development', 'here', 'channeling', 'dirty', 'cop', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'perfect', 'actor', 'just', 'creepy', 'vibe', 'might', 'recognize', 'time', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'off-putting', 'delivery', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'mixed', 'poor', 'impulse', 'control', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Leon/The', 'Professional', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'ride', 'bikes', 'give', 'people', 'bikes', 'stuff', 'chase', 'people', 'bikes', 'Really', 'only', 'other', 'person', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'remember', 'movie', 'over', 'Aasif', 'Mandvi', 'AKA', 'guy', 'Daily', 'Show', 'Jericho', 'remember', 'show', '.This', 'chase', 'movie', 'wackiness', 'bike', 'culture', 'aplenty', 'plot', 'point', 'previous', 'understanding', 'hawala', 'willingness', 'just', 'overlook', 'need', 'understand', 'movie', 'moving', 'too', 'quickly', 'stop', 'really', 'explain', 'want', 'watch', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'be', 'charming', 'ride', 'bike', 'thwart', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'traffic', 'predicting', 'brain', 'powers', 'perfect', 'movie', ""'re"", 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'hung', 'up', 'films', 'needing', ""'plot"", 'development', 'might', 'want', 'sit', 'one', 'out', 'really', 'should', 'try', 'join', 'first', 'group', 'sometimes', 'just', 'need', 'turn', 'off', 'brain', 'have', 'fun', 'time']",Premium Rush

1599378,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B009MO5E10,Andre Dursin,"[1, 2]","Mid to late August has perennially been a weak time for new theatrical releases. When I was growing up, it was always the dumping grounds for expected hits that studios shuffled away in full acknowledgment that they weren't the films they were supposed to be (hello, ""Superman IV: The Quest For Peace""). These days, some minor hits have popped up in the waning days of August, and this year has produced another sleeper: screenwriter David Koepp's exciting PREMIUM RUSH.A tidy, edge-of-your-seat thriller that recalls Kevin Bacon's `80s misfire ""Quicksilver"" in premise only, ""Premium Rush"" likewise follows a NYC bike messenger - here superbly portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt - who's been charged with delivering a parcel to Chinatown...one that NYPD cop Michael Shannon is highly interested in. Trying to stay one step ahead of his pursuer, Gordon-Levitt darts in and out of midtown traffic, trying to figure out what he's carrying and help out a college acquaintance - a young Chinese woman - whose life seems to be riding on the outcome of his delivery.I've long criticized some of Koepp's scripts for high profile summer movies (particularly his efforts for Steven Spielberg, including the underwhelming ""War of the Worlds"" and""The Lost World: Jurassic Park""), but ""Premium Rush"" - written with John Kamps - ranks as one of his tightest, and most satisfying, screenplays, managing to mix a fast-moving action film with a twisty, compelling story that packs more of an emotional punch than anticipated. The authentic locations add immeasurably to the film's many scenes of Gordon-Levitt and his fellow bikers being an inch or two away from certain disaster, maneuvering through a maze-like succession of traffic, pedestrians and lousy Big Apple drivers; Koepp the director, meanwhile, deftly mixes in flashbacks to tell a story that works just perfectly in the short, 90-minute time frame employed here.""Premium Rush"" didn't make much noise in theaters this past weekend, and seemed to fly under the radar completely in terms of most viewers' pre-release awareness (I hadn't even heard of the film until it opened Friday). That's unfortunate, because it's the complete opposite of the bloated, overlong $200 million typical blockbuster most studios are interested in these days. If you're looking for a short but sweet, fresh Hollywood movie, ""Premium Rush"" puts a splendid cap on the (surprisingly good) summer movie season of 2012.",4,"Late Summer Sleeper That's Fresh Antitode to the Usual ""Blockbuster""",1345852800,"08 25, 2012",2012,2439,"['Mid', 'late', 'August', 'perennially', 'been', 'weak', 'time', 'new', 'theatrical', 'releases', 'When', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'was', 'always', 'dumping', 'grounds', 'expected', 'hits', 'studios', 'shuffled', 'away', 'full', 'acknowledgment', 'were', ""n't"", 'films', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'hello', 'Superman', 'IV', 'Quest', 'Peace', 'days', 'minor', 'hits', 'have', 'popped', 'up', 'waning', 'days', 'August', 'year', 'produced', 'sleeper', 'screenwriter', 'David', 'Koepp', 'exciting', 'PREMIUM', 'RUSH.A', 'tidy', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'thriller', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', '80s', 'misfire', 'Quicksilver', 'premise', 'only', 'Premium', 'Rush', 'likewise', 'NYC', 'bike', 'messenger', 'here', 'superbly', 'portrayed', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'who', 'been', 'charged', 'delivering', 'parcel', 'Chinatown', 'one', 'NYPD', 'cop', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'highly', 'interested', 'Trying', 'stay', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'pursuer', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'darts', 'midtown', 'traffic', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'carrying', 'help', 'out', 'college', 'acquaintance', 'young', 'Chinese', 'woman', 'life', 'be', 'riding', 'outcome', 'delivery.I', ""'ve"", 'long', 'criticized', 'Koepp', 'scripts', 'high', 'profile', 'summer', 'movies', 'particularly', 'efforts', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'including', 'underwhelming', 'War', 'Worlds', 'Lost', 'World', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'Premium', 'Rush', 'written', 'John', 'Kamps', 'ranks', 'one', 'tightest', 'most', 'satisfying', 'screenplays', 'managing', 'mix', 'fast-moving', 'action', 'film', 'twisty', 'compelling', 'story', 'more', 'emotional', 'punch', 'anticipated', 'authentic', 'locations', 'add', 'immeasurably', 'film', 'many', 'scenes', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'fellow', 'bikers', 'being', 'inch', 'two', 'away', 'certain', 'disaster', 'maneuvering', 'maze-like', 'succession', 'traffic', 'pedestrians', 'lousy', 'Big', 'Apple', 'drivers', 'Koepp', 'director', 'meanwhile', 'deftly', 'mixes', 'flashbacks', 'tell', 'story', 'just', 'perfectly', 'short', '90-minute', 'time', 'frame', 'employed', 'here', 'Premium', 'Rush', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'noise', 'theaters', 'past', 'weekend', 'seemed', 'fly', 'radar', 'completely', 'terms', 'most', 'viewers', 'pre-release', 'awareness', 'had', ""n't"", 'even', 'heard', 'film', 'opened', 'Friday', 'unfortunate', 'complete', 'opposite', 'bloated', 'overlong', '200', 'million', 'typical', 'blockbuster', 'most', 'studios', 'are', 'interested', 'days', ""'re"", 'looking', 'short', 'sweet', 'fresh', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'Premium', 'Rush', 'splendid', 'cap', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'summer', 'movie', 'season', '2012']",Premium Rush

I mean, it's not quite as bad as ""Jade"" or ""Showgirls"" or ""Poetic Justice,"" but it's pretty close.  In fact, the lack of that extra layer of pure awfulness makes this less of a classic than those steamers, since this film suffers more from mediocrity and poor direction than from pure, cosmic-level stinkiness. My wife and I went into this with low expectations, anticipating a not-great-but-watchably-mindless action flick with two actors we admire (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who has been doing amazing work recently in films such as ""50/50"" and stone-faced Michael Shannon, who was riveting in ""Boardwalk Empire"".)From the opening first few seconds, it was apparent that the director was playing this for laughs, with the character stereotypes so broad and the plot and script so brazenly bad that the idea was hey, just relax into it and enjoy the ride. Sadly, though, there wasn't enough substance behind the nudge-nudge, wink-wink to sustain any real interest, and the laxness of the filmmaking infects the entire project. The performers clearly quit trying early on: Gordon-Levitt goes all Keanu and blank, happy to cash a check for just riding a bike round and getting a good workout, while Shannon barks and shouts and glowers his way through bad scene after bad scene -- an actor who thrives on restraint was told to over-emote and chew scenery, and it was a huge mistake.At its core, ""Premium Rush"" is simply not a good film. It could have been an okay popcorn-muncher but it wound up being a worthless dud. Like, shockingly lame. There's one fun scene with James Hong speaking unsubtitled Chinese, but that's about it.

1599384,A2582KMXLK2P06,B009MO5E10,B. E Jackson,"[0, 2]","Premium Rush is perhaps one of the most exciting bike-riding movies ever.  It's about a delivery boy (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who's job is to make prompt deliveries without anything standing in his way however... what if someone were to come out of nowhere and demand the delivery boy hand a package over to him?  This is the situation Joseph faces one afternoon.A guy (played by Michael Shannon) that we soon realize is a dirty cop associated with the Chinese mafia (or at least pretends to be associated) demands that Joseph hand over an important letter but... he refuses to, and since the delivery boy has a ton of experience on his bike given the fact he has to swerve around heavy Manhattan traffic all day, he's easily able to evade the cop.  Of course this is all entirely unrealistic since in reality a cop chasing a biker around presents a LOT of dangerous situations that wouldn't end well for either of them, but for the sake of an action/adventure film, it provides a good deal of entertainment watching the biker outsmart the cop time and time again as he knows all the secret shortcuts and hidden entrances between buildings that enable him to always stay one step ahead of the cop.One little detail the movie utilizes that I really admire is whenever Joseph is presented with a tricky situation so he contemplates the possible worst case scenarios involving a bike accident in his head before making the appropriate action.  Nice details there.  We actually *see* the possibilities of the worst case scenarios, since the movie writers went the extra mile and included them.  Other times Joseph finds himself racing against others (either friends of his, or friendly competitors- not really sure which) in the hopes of making a delivery before they do.  Friendly -but serious- competition basically.My only complaint is when all this bike riding excitement takes a back seat so a storyline involving a China town in Manhattan can develop, and specifically a Chinese woman who's desperately trying to legally get her young son out of China and into the United States.  Michael Shannon's police officer character constantly finds himself roughing up -or attempting to rough up- either Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character or the Asian people he deals with.  As a result, the bike racing excitement takes a back seat so this aspect of the storyline can develop which creates some slowdown and boredom from time to time (and the reason I'm taking away one star from the overall rating).Overall, despite the occasional boring moments, Premium Rush mostly delivers in bike riding, cop evasion entertainment.",4,more proof that city streets are dangeorus,1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,2620,"['Premium', 'Rush', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'exciting', 'bike-riding', 'movies', 'ever', 'delivery', 'boy', 'played', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'who', 'job', 'make', 'prompt', 'deliveries', 'anything', 'standing', 'way', 'however', 'what', 'someone', 'were', 'come', 'nowhere', 'demand', 'delivery', 'boy', 'hand', 'package', 'situation', 'Joseph', 'one', 'afternoon.A', 'guy', 'played', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'soon', 'realize', 'dirty', 'cop', 'associated', 'Chinese', 'mafia', 'least', 'pretends', 'be', 'associated', 'Joseph', 'hand', 'important', 'letter', 'delivery', 'boy', 'ton', 'experience', 'bike', 'given', 'fact', 'swerve', 'around', 'heavy', 'Manhattan', 'traffic', 'day', 'easily', 'able', 'evade', 'cop', 'course', 'entirely', 'unrealistic', 'reality', 'cop', 'chasing', 'biker', 'LOT', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'would', ""n't"", 'end', 'well', 'sake', 'action/adventure', 'film', 'good', 'deal', 'entertainment', 'watching', 'biker', 'cop', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'secret', 'shortcuts', 'hidden', 'entrances', 'buildings', 'enable', 'always', 'stay', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'cop.One', 'little', 'detail', 'movie', 'really', 'admire', 'whenever', 'Joseph', 'presented', 'tricky', 'situation', 'so', 'possible', 'worst', 'case', 'scenarios', 'involving', 'bike', 'accident', 'head', 'making', 'appropriate', 'action', 'Nice', 'details', 'there', 'actually', '*see*', 'possibilities', 'worst', 'case', 'scenarios', 'movie', 'writers', 'went', 'extra', 'mile', 'included', 'Other', 'times', 'Joseph', 'racing', 'others', 'friends', 'friendly', 'competitors-', 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'hopes', 'making', 'delivery', 'do', 'Friendly', '-but', 'serious-', 'competition', 'only', 'complaint', 'when', 'bike', 'riding', 'excitement', 'back', 'seat', 'storyline', 'involving', 'China', 'town', 'Manhattan', 'can', 'develop', 'specifically', 'Chinese', 'woman', 'who', 'desperately', 'trying', 'legally', 'get', 'young', 'son', 'China', 'United', 'States', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'police', 'officer', 'character', 'constantly', 'roughing', 'up', '-or', 'attempting', 'rough', 'up-', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'character', 'Asian', 'people', 'result', 'bike', 'racing', 'excitement', 'back', 'seat', 'aspect', 'storyline', 'can', 'develop', 'slowdown', 'boredom', 'time', 'time', 'reason', ""'m"", 'taking', 'away', 'one', 'star', 'overall', 'rating', '.Overall', 'occasional', 'boring', 'moments', 'Premium', 'Rush', 'mostly', 'bike', 'riding', 'cop', 'evasion', 'entertainment']",Premium Rush

This is about a bike messenger in New York (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who takes a dangerous package that puts him in great peril, even more than the constant running of red lights in rush hour. This features two of my favorite actors in Gordon-Levitt and Michael Shannon; I like them so much, I didn't even bother looking up anything about it, I just went. Unfortunately, though, this is only adequate. I could never get 100% excited or invested, and I think that is largely due to the story not being terribly strong; there are a number of cliches in this, and it feels awfully familiar for an otherwise original movie. The things that Premium Rush does have going for it is the fact that it is pretty non-stop, and there is extra depth that Shannon and Gordon-Levitt add to what would be shallow characters; JGL brings the charisma and Shannon bring the intensity.

1599388,A1GB0HW46Y2EB,B009MO5E10,Bruce G. Taylor,"[0, 0]","""Premium Rush"" was apparently a late-summer release -- not usually a help at the box office.  I don't know how it did in that regard but I found it to be very exciting and visually involving with some good  touches of humor along the way.  The lead character ""Wiley"" is played  by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, whom I consider to be a very gifted actor judging from some of his earlier films, notably ""Mysterious Skin"" (2004) and ""The Lookout"" (2007).  He is also fine in this film with great screen presence and physical ability; he did many of the risky bicycle stunts himself.  He plays the part of a delivery guy on a bike in busy Manhattan who is attempting to deliver a package that his adversary, well played by Michael Shannon, wants to grab before he can deliver it.Basically this is a rather simple set up story wise, but the  cinematography throughout Manhattan has to be seen to be believed.  The camera car is the real hero of the film and is shown in the special features section as being a highly maneuverable vehicle having a camera arm in its roof extending several feet beyond the front or back of the car.  I imagine the cinematographer would be sitting in the back seat with camera controls and a video-assist set up providing control of a Panaflex hanging from the end of the arm resulting in the some very nifty shooting.  Watching on a flat-screen of a decent size, the viewer's sense of motion and involvement is undeniable.  Gordon-Levitt's ""Wiley"" character hooks us right from the start and we are on the bike with him thanks to the subjective POV shooting made possible with the camera car.Joseph Gordon-Levitt has had a few small but important roles in some recent big-ticket pictures; I'm predicting that his blockbuster is not too far away.  :.",4,"Exciting, involving -- and funny, too!",1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,1767,"['Premium', 'Rush', 'was', 'apparently', 'late-summer', 'release', 'not', 'usually', 'help', 'box', 'office', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'did', 'regard', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'exciting', 'visually', 'involving', 'good', 'touches', 'humor', 'way', 'lead', 'character', 'Wiley', 'played', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'whom', 'consider', 'be', 'very', 'gifted', 'actor', 'judging', 'earlier', 'films', 'notably', 'Mysterious', 'Skin', '2004', 'Lookout', '2007', 'also', 'fine', 'film', 'great', 'screen', 'presence', 'physical', 'ability', 'did', 'many', 'risky', 'bicycle', 'stunts', 'part', 'delivery', 'guy', 'bike', 'busy', 'Manhattan', 'who', 'attempting', 'deliver', 'package', 'adversary', 'well', 'played', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'grab', 'can', 'deliver', 'it.Basically', 'rather', 'simple', 'set', 'up', 'story', 'wise', 'cinematography', 'Manhattan', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'camera', 'car', 'real', 'hero', 'film', 'shown', 'special', 'features', 'section', 'being', 'highly', 'maneuverable', 'vehicle', 'having', 'camera', 'arm', 'roof', 'extending', 'several', 'feet', 'front', 'back', 'car', 'imagine', 'cinematographer', 'would', 'be', 'sitting', 'back', 'seat', 'camera', 'controls', 'video-assist', 'set', 'up', 'providing', 'control', 'Panaflex', 'hanging', 'end', 'arm', 'resulting', 'very', 'nifty', 'shooting', 'Watching', 'flat-screen', 'decent', 'size', 'viewer', 'sense', 'motion', 'involvement', 'undeniable', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Wiley', 'character', 'hooks', 'right', 'start', 'are', 'bike', 'thanks', 'subjective', 'POV', 'shooting', 'made', 'possible', 'camera', 'car.Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'had', 'few', 'small', 'important', 'roles', 'recent', 'big-ticket', 'pictures', ""'m"", 'predicting', 'blockbuster', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'away']",Premium Rush

He rides like he has a death wish, having removed the brakes from his bikes and using his instincts and quick wits to navigate complicated New York City traffic and sidewalk situations.Thousands of messages are trafficked throughout New York City everyday by bicycle messengers, but the one that Wilee gets on this day, brings suspense and danger to an already suspenseful and dangerous job.

Written (with John Kamps) and directed by David Koepp whose screenplay writing credits are most impressive, the cast is terrific and seem to be having a great time with this fast paced escapade.Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is one of 1,500 bike couriers in Manhattan who rides on the edge by having a bike with no brakes. `I like to ride. Fixed gear. No brakes. Can't stop. Don't want to, either.' He has finished law school but has put off taking his bar exam because he can't face the idea of living behind a desk in a boring job. He works for a courier service run by Raj (Aasif Mandvi) along with his girlfriend Vanessa (Dania Ramirez) and a rather wild lad Manny (Wol&eacute; Parks, excellent!)On this day, Wilee has a delivery that is so valuable that a corrupt NYC Detective Bobby Monday (Michael Shannon), who needs the money, begins to chase Wilee throughout the city to get it before the envelope is delivered. The plot includes Vanessa's roommate Nima (Jamie Chung) who is in the throes of attempting to payoff the Chinese cartel in order to allow her young son to be brought into the country. The plot twists and turns are managed by frequent flashback episodes they explain the path of events that occur as crises. The supporting cast is strong- the NYPD bike cop (Christopher Chance) and the crew of Chinese actors who clutter the den of the Pai Gow players where the action comes to a head.This is an entertainment movie with some clever cinematic devices and a lot of comment about our present state of communication and law enforcement and immigration problems.  Gordon-Levitt shines and Michael Shannon gives us a repulsively sicko bad cop in full bloom.

Not FedEx, not UPS, the closest descendant to the Pony Express, in my eyes, is the aggressive bicycle messenger. The amended credo should be ""Neither rain, nor snow, nor sleet, nor crazed cabbies, nor inattentive pedestrians..."" In New York City, home to eight million, 1,500 daredevil bike couriers navigate the bustling steel canyons at 30 mph, and Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) styles himself the speediest one. He rides his fixie - this super lightweight, single gear, no brake having bike - with wild abandon. For this daily adrenaline fix, he gave up law school and a life as a paper pusher. He mentions how it's a good day if he makes $80.Well, different strokes for different folks, Wilee. I wonder, is it worth the $30 he's offered to premium rush a mysterious envelope from 116th & Broadway all the way to Chinatown? Wilee collects the package at 5:33pm and is given the delivery deadline of 7pm. For the best bike courier in Manhattan, this should be no thing but a chicken wing. But, Wilee, man plans and God laughs, and one simply never plans for intervention from a dirty cop with ""impulse-control issues.""There are some terrific elements to PREMIUM RUSH. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, of course, handles his business. The stunt work is impressive. The chase scenes are eye-catching stuff. Dania Ramirez as Wilee's slighted girlfriend/fellow messenger is gorgeous eye candy. It's plenty funny. PREMIUM RUSH reminds me ofCellular (New Line Platinum Series)in a lot of ways. Both narratives are framed around a breakneck race against time. Both make use of the city and its denizens as obstacles. Both feature stand-out big bads in the shape of crooked constabulary. Michael Shannon's performance as NYPD sleaze Bobby Monday is a mini tour de force. Shannon veers close to caricature territory but never quite goes over. The whole time, he generates this sense of crazed menace, of alarming unpredictability. Inasmuch as a fellow lead actor can steal scenes, this guy does so. He's like if one of the Three Stooges had turned to the dark side.It's a film constructed of familiar bits. We're given broad strokes in terms of character work, and that's okay. That, and the simplicity in plot allow the filmmakers to give the audience what they want: compressed storytelling executed in real time - barring a flashback or three - and reliant on spellbinding action beats. This film demonstrates that old-fashioned creativity and big hustle and well-done practical effects can trump the almighty CGI. There are four permutations of the chase, all four involving Wilee and his beloved fixie. I love the recurring gimmick in which we get a peek at Wilee's split-second internal process as he calculates his safest passage thru the lethal streets of Manhattan. As Wilee projects possible scenarios, we see the resulting mayhem and carnage play out should he choose the wrong route. I think these are the only moments in which CG plays a part. Anyway, it's nice to see Joseph Gordon-Levitt take a break from the more ambitious projects. Here, it's obvious how much of a blast he's having. I can even tell his four stunt doubles are having equal doses of fun. And how awesome and comic is that bike cop, him what's a stunt guy that's never acted before? That put-upon bike cop may've been my favorite side character. Maybe he should've paid heed to Wilee's terse, all-encompassing philosophy: ""Brakes are death.""The DVD's bonus stuff:- ""The Starting Line - cast & filmmaking featurette (00:09:30 minutes)- ""Behind the Wheels - action & stunts featurette"" (00:12:51 minutes)",4,"""Brakes are death.""",1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,3633,"['Uh-oh', 'actors', 'bicycles', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'acting', 'Not', 'FedEx', 'not', 'UPS', 'closest', 'descendant', 'Pony', 'Express', 'eyes', 'aggressive', 'bicycle', 'messenger', 'amended', 'credo', 'should', 'be', 'Neither', 'rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'crazed', 'cabbies', 'inattentive', 'pedestrians', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'home', 'eight', 'million', '1,500', 'daredevil', 'bike', 'couriers', 'navigate', 'bustling', 'steel', 'canyons', '30', 'mph', 'Wilee', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'speediest', 'one', 'fixie', 'super', 'lightweight', 'single', 'gear', 'brake', 'having', 'wild', 'abandon', 'daily', 'adrenaline', 'fix', 'gave', 'up', 'law', 'school', 'life', 'paper', 'pusher', 'how', 'good', 'day', '80.Well', 'different', 'strokes', 'different', 'folks', 'Wilee', 'wonder', '30', 'offered', 'premium', 'rush', 'mysterious', 'envelope', '116th', 'Broadway', 'way', 'Chinatown', 'Wilee', 'package', '5:33pm', 'given', 'delivery', 'deadline', '7pm', 'best', 'bike', 'courier', 'Manhattan', 'should', 'be', 'thing', 'chicken', 'wing', 'Wilee', 'man', 'plans', 'God', 'one', 'simply', 'never', 'intervention', 'dirty', 'cop', 'impulse-control', 'issues', 'are', 'terrific', 'elements', 'PREMIUM', 'RUSH', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'course', 'business', 'stunt', 'work', 'impressive', 'chase', 'scenes', 'are', 'eye-catching', 'stuff', 'Dania', 'Ramirez', 'Wilee', 'slighted', 'girlfriend/fellow', 'messenger', 'gorgeous', 'eye', 'candy', 'plenty', 'funny', 'PREMIUM', 'RUSH', 'ofCellular', 'New', 'Line', 'Platinum', 'Series', 'lot', 'ways', 'narratives', 'are', 'framed', 'breakneck', 'race', 'time', 'make', 'use', 'city', 'denizens', 'obstacles', 'feature', 'stand-out', 'big', 'bads', 'shape', 'crooked', 'constabulary', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'performance', 'NYPD', 'sleaze', 'Bobby', 'Monday', 'mini', 'tour', 'force', 'Shannon', 'veers', 'close', 'caricature', 'territory', 'never', 'quite', 'whole', 'time', 'sense', 'crazed', 'menace', 'alarming', 'unpredictability', 'Inasmuch', 'fellow', 'lead', 'actor', 'can', 'steal', 'scenes', 'guy', 'so', 'one', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'had', 'turned', 'dark', 'side.It', 'film', 'constructed', 'familiar', 'bits', ""'re"", 'given', 'broad', 'strokes', 'terms', 'character', 'work', 'okay', 'simplicity', 'plot', 'filmmakers', 'give', 'audience', 'what', 'want', 'compressed', 'storytelling', 'executed', 'real', 'time', 'barring', 'flashback', 'three', 'reliant', 'spellbinding', 'action', 'beats', 'film', 'old-fashioned', 'creativity', 'big', 'hustle', 'well-done', 'practical', 'effects', 'can', 'trump', 'almighty', 'CGI', 'are', 'four', 'permutations', 'chase', 'four', 'involving', 'Wilee', 'beloved', 'fixie', 'love', 'recurring', 'gimmick', 'get', 'peek', 'Wilee', 'split-second', 'internal', 'process', 'safest', 'passage', 'thru', 'lethal', 'streets', 'Manhattan', 'Wilee', 'projects', 'possible', 'scenarios', 'see', 'resulting', 'mayhem', 'carnage', 'play', 'out', 'should', 'choose', 'wrong', 'route', 'think', 'are', 'only', 'moments', 'CG', 'part', 'Anyway', 'nice', 'see', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'take', 'break', 'more', 'ambitious', 'projects', 'Here', 'obvious', 'how', 'much', 'blast', 'having', 'can', 'even', 'tell', 'four', 'stunt', 'doubles', 'are', 'having', 'equal', 'doses', 'fun', 'how', 'awesome', 'comic', 'bike', 'cop', 'what', 'stunt', 'guy', 'never', 'acted', 'put-upon', 'cop', 'may', ""'ve"", 'been', 'favorite', 'side', 'character', 'Maybe', 'should', ""'ve"", 'paid', 'heed', 'Wilee', 'terse', 'all-encompassing', 'philosophy', 'Brakes', 'are', 'death', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'Starting', 'Line', 'cast', 'filmmaking', 'featurette', '00:09:30', 'minutes', 'Wheels', 'action', 'stunts', 'featurette', '00:12:51', 'minutes']",Premium Rush

The stunt riding we see in this action flick is probably not much different from their daily death-defying duties. In this one, a messenger must get across town in a short time, so we ride along as he zips through traffic, across parks, and through stores, all the while trying to elude some guy in a silver sedan who seems determined to intercept him.* Joseph Gordon-Levitt (""Inception"") is the Energizer Bunny, hired at 5:30 PM to deliver a ""Premium Rush"" envelope to Chinatown by 7:00 PM; he was specifically requested by name. This film runs 91 minutes so we watch this in ""real"" time.* Dania Ramirez (""American Reunion"") is his undecided girlfriend whose roommate kicks her out. She too, is a bike messenger.* Wol&eacute; Parks (lots of TV) is the gleeful competitor, not only for our hero's acclaim in the bike messenger community, but also for the affections of that lovely girlfriend.* Jamie Chung (""Sucker Punch"") is an inscrutable Asian whose hard-earned money is at stake. She hired our hero.* Michael Shannon (""Take Shelter"") is a relentless NYPD cop with a gambling problem.* Christopher Place (stunts in films like ""The Lucky One,"" ""Safe,"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises"") is the dauntless NYPD bike cop who gives our hero a run for his money. This guy is so dedicated we can't help but (sorta) root for him.There are very few interludes where we can take a breather: We see countless accidents where a cyclist goes head over heels through the air after being hit by taxis, car doors, garbage cans, bikes and other hazards of the trade. We come to fear that scary cop in the sedan as he pursues our hero. We very much appreciate the goose-bump moment near the end when the bike messengers rally their forces, and naturally everyone likes a happy ending.This PG-13 outing has very little profanity, no blowie uppie stuff, a couple of gunshots, some violence and oodles of vehicular (mostly bicycle) mayhem.

One of the film's best qualities is that it's unique. This is definitely something that's never been done before, and if it has I've never seen it. Another solid thing about Premium Rush is that it's fun and it's engaging. There are no firefights, there are no huge explosions, but at the same time it manages to be an adrenaline rush.Premium Rush follows three characters, Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Bobby Monday (Michael Shannon), and Nima (Jamie Chung), throughout a crazy day that manages to entangle all three of their lives together. Wilee is a bike messenger out of, what seems like, necessity. He can't see himself in an office and he doesn't like suits. Still, the thrill of riding alone isn't enough. Wilee's bike contains no gears and no brake. His bike can't stop, and he doesn't want to.Bobby is an officer for the NYPD who has a pretty bad gambling problem. That's where Nima comes in. Nima is a quite, reserved, woman who works at a college. Her main goal is to import a special package from China. Bobby's sharks tell him that he needs to intercept the ticket that she gave to Wilee if he wants to smooth things out.I wasn't really expecting the film's story to take this route, but I still found it enjoyable. Gordon-Levitt gave another fantastic performance as Wilee. If he keeps this up he's going to have one of the most versatile catalogs in the film business. He isn't afraid to take on a role and it seems to be working in his favor.As much as I wanted to like Shannon's performance I found it to be somewhat forced. I don't know if it was because I didn't like his character, I hated Bobby with a passion, or if I just genuinely did not like his performance, but I didn't find him enjoyable. He isn't terrible and, at times, he does a good job, but his performance isn't consistent. Chung didn't have as big of a role as the other two main characters, but she delivered in all of her scenes.The only thing that really irritated me about the movie is that, in two scenes, there was conversations between two characters that was all in Chinese. This wouldn't be a problem, but, unlike almost every film ever made, they didn't include subtitles. So the viewer is sitting there like a moron because they have no idea what's being said. In one of the scenes the conversation last at least 90 seconds so it feels awkward for those don't speak, or understand, the language.Overall Score: 8/10 - I highly doubt Premium Rush will go down as one of the greatest films ever created. However, while it isn't necessarily jaw-dropping, it manages to keep the viewer interested throughout the entire 90 minutes. I think it could have benefited from a more intricate plot, but I would still recommend watching this if you have the time.",4,8/10 - Good,1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,2856,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.It', 'hard', 'find', 'right', 'term', 'summarize', 'Premium', 'Rush', 'One', 'film', 'best', 'qualities', 'unique', 'definitely', 'something', 'never', 'been', 'done', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'solid', 'thing', 'Premium', 'Rush', 'fun', 'engaging', 'are', 'firefights', 'are', 'huge', 'explosions', 'same', 'time', 'be', 'adrenaline', 'rush.Premium', 'Rush', 'three', 'characters', 'Wilee', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Bobby', 'Monday', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'Nima', 'Jamie', 'Chung', 'crazy', 'day', 'entangle', 'three', 'lives', 'together', 'Wilee', 'bike', 'messenger', 'what', 'necessity', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'office', ""n't"", 'like', 'suits', 'Still', 'thrill', 'riding', 'alone', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Wilee', 'bike', 'gears', 'brake', 'bike', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', ""n't"", 'want', 'to.Bobby', 'officer', 'NYPD', 'who', 'pretty', 'bad', 'gambling', 'problem', 'where', 'Nima', 'Nima', 'quite', 'reserved', 'woman', 'who', 'college', 'main', 'goal', 'import', 'special', 'package', 'China', 'Bobby', 'sharks', 'tell', 'intercept', 'ticket', 'gave', 'Wilee', 'smooth', 'things', 'out.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'expecting', 'film', 'story', 'take', 'route', 'still', 'found', 'enjoyable', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'gave', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'Wilee', 'going', 'have', 'one', 'most', 'versatile', 'catalogs', 'film', 'business', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'take', 'role', 'be', 'working', 'favor.As', 'much', 'wanted', 'Shannon', 'performance', 'found', 'be', 'somewhat', 'forced', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'character', 'hated', 'Bobby', 'passion', 'just', 'genuinely', 'did', 'not', 'performance', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'enjoyable', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'times', 'good', 'job', 'performance', ""n't"", 'consistent', 'Chung', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'big', 'role', 'other', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'delivered', 'scenes.The', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'irritated', 'movie', 'two', 'scenes', 'was', 'conversations', 'two', 'characters', 'was', 'Chinese', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'problem', 'almost', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'subtitles', 'viewer', 'sitting', 'there', 'moron', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'one', 'scenes', 'conversation', 'last', 'least', '90', 'seconds', 'awkward', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'understand', 'language.Overall', 'Score', '8/10', 'highly', 'doubt', 'Premium', 'Rush', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'created', 'However', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'jaw-dropping', 'keep', 'viewer', 'interested', 'entire', '90', 'minutes', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'benefited', 'more', 'intricate', 'plot', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'watching', 'have', 'time']",Premium Rush

1599460,A3KDVSFMPMXSRO,B009MO5E10,Kevin F. Tasker,"[0, 1]","Premium Rush is a tonally-confused, poorly-written summer spectacle that will leave most mature audience members wanting more. Thirteen year old boys, on the other hand, should have no trouble getting amped up over the action...but maybe they shouldn't. The film presents negative racial and gender stereotypes in strikingly non-chalant fashion. More on that in a moment. First you ought to know that the plot is cardboard thin: a one-dimensional tough-guy bicycle delivery rider (played by a sleepwalking (or riding) Joseph Gordon Levitt) is targeted by a lowlife cop (the type-casted psychotic Michael Shannon) because he picks up a package worth quite a bit of money. Cue the chase scenes, which are admittedly pretty entertaining with convincing CGI for the most part.The problem is the script which is peppered with an ungodly amount of flashbacks, super expository narration, a frame narrative that loops back on itself with twenty minutes left in the movie, and character so paper-thin that you will never remember them when the credits roll. Take Willie, our ostensible hero, his one and only defining characteristic is that he likes to ride his bike with no brakes! Woah, so symbolic. Spare me. Oh yeah and Teenage Wasteland plays as a book-end device.... how clever! It is also worth noting that the film is incredibly sexist and racist, as well. Though it includes a number of female and ethnically diverse characters, these folks are given very little to do. The black guy, for example, is presently as a cartoonish villain with no real redeeming qualities other than his muscles.

Despite email, secure servers and PDFs - there are still things that require point-to-point hand delivery. Legal documents for the most part, but includes many other items that cannot wait or be trusted to the mail service. Primarily employing young people who live for speed - the premium rush - they skillfully dodge and wind their way through New York City's notoriously congested traffic; and are the go-to service when it absolutely has to get there without delay.Levitt plays Wiley, as in the funny toon coyote, and is quite possibly the best messenger currently rolling on two wheels. He's certainly the most daring. To the admiration of some, to the jealous chagrin of others: The young man doesn't utilize a brake system. His bike is two wheels and an alloy frame. That's it. He never stops.Chosen by an old friend from college to make a very special delivery. One that has terrible ramifications should he fail his assignment.And seeing to it that he does fail is a desperate and dirty cop. Neck deep into the Tongs, cold-blooded and ruthless Chinese gangs with ties back to the old country, he needs what the delivery dude is carrying and is willing to break every law and every bone in Wiley's body to get it.As the cop and Wiley employ increasingly clever and viciously improvised tactics from their particular bag of tricks - the stakes of their street battle becomes higher and more dangerous. People start to get hurt. The pair pull out all the stops when it becomes clear that blood will flow regardless of the outcome.JGL is certainly making a splash these past two years, headlining in no less than five major productions - a sure sign that Hollywood is prepping him for much bigger things.Good.Looking forward to seeing more of the actor.Movie Notes:- One of a small handful of films that mentions the underground Hawala remittance system. Although frowned upon by the US government, is one of the most widely accepted money transfer processes used around the globe. Estimates, and there aren't any hard numbers, generally put the value at more than half-a-trillion dollars a year exchanging hands through what is essentially an honor system.- I see from IMDb's listing that JGL's character is listed as ""Wilee"".

1599470,A1HOLE9R6WPT85,B009MO5E10,Mad Max,"[2, 3]","This movie uses the extreme bike messenger culture of New York as a backdrop for an action/adventure story. So it's mostly a 90-minute chase scene, with a few flashbacks & some plot elements thrown in there.The extreme bikers are similar to Parkour (PK / Free Running), where they don't stop for anything, do some stunts, etc. It's visually interesting. The plot is a bit of a cliche - Joseph Gordon-Levitt is carrying a package that could take down some dirty cops &/or the Chinese mafia, so he's being chased and hunted.My other complaint is that it didn't have more bike stunts - they missed some real opportunities here, nothing here was quite as exciting as the Parkour documentaries I've seen. Nonetheless, it did keep my interest. And I think one of the goals was realism, so this is definitely not ""Transporter"" or anything like that.I wasn't very aware of Joseph Gordon-Levitt until fairly recently (Inception, Batman, etc). He is hitting a really nice stride with his career, and in this movie he completely took on his character, 100% believable.The style & cinematography reminded me a bit of Danny Boyle's 172 hours (starring James Franco). Crisp and fresh.So even if the plot was a bit formulaic, I still give it a solid 4 stars because of great acting, eye-popping camera work, and a think-outside-the-box premise. I'm pretty sick of traditional Hollywood action movie, and it's so cool watching an ""under the radar"" flick like this provide as many thrills as a Blockbuster Bond movie.

It seems like every other scene has at least one person riding on a bicycle.  Sometimes there are three or four and (spoiler alert!) at the end there are a whole BUNCH of bicycle riders circling the bad cop.  Usually, someone is chasing someone else, and the person being chased is on a bicycle.  Why always a bicycle?  People could be chased while driving a car, and many movies have had such scenes in them.  Maybe if they varied it up a bit- make people chase each other on ATVs through a swamp, or on foot through a crowd or something.  While I'm not opposed to bicycles altogether, it hardly makes sense to have an entire movie about riding them.  The rest of the plot was pretty good.  The good guy helps someone out, gets his girlfriend to love him even more, and thwarts the evil plans of a really bad cop.  What more do you need than that?  Certainly not bicycles.My verdict: Great Movie! (But too much bicycle riding)P.S. Not to be picky, but the ENTIRE MOVIE takes place in New York City.  A little more variety would have been nice.  They could have shot scenes in Trenton, NJ or a generic small town in the middle of Texas.  Of course, to get there you'd have to drive something other than a bicycle, so there's your reason.

1599480,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B009MO5E10,M. Oleson,"[11, 20]","When I first saw trailers for this movie I was thinking, ""Why do I want to see a movie about bike messengers?"" Then I saw some reviews which were for the most part, positive. So what the hell? Well, I should have stuck with my initial instincts.Here's the deal. In New York City, the town is flush with in-person messenger services and the quickest delivery method is via bicycle. Evidently, the small companies are very competitive. One such company has law school grad Wilee (as in coyote) employed. He is arguably the fastest and most dependable. As he says numerous times it is because he doesn't use bikes with gears or get this...brakes! More on that in a minute. Played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt in his all-in earnest way, Wilee is given an assignment to carry a ticket used by Chinese money launderers given to him by the 23 year old roommate (Jamie Chung) of his girlfriend (Dania Ramirez). It's worth about $50K and is to be exchanged for her 4 year old son who is being smuggled into the city from China.A crooked cop played with relish by Michael Shannon has an unusual name, Bob Monday as opposed to Joe Friday. Get it? Bob is up to his eyeballs in debt to Chinese gangsters for his gambling losses playing what appears to be pai gow. He's tipped off about the ""laundry"" ticket which is as good as cash. So the rest of the film is him chasing Wilee after Wilee refuses to give up the ticket.Back to the no brakes thing. Wilee uses this exclamation seemingly dozens of times throughout the movie which is why it drove me crazy. In an early scene as he whizzes in and out of traffic, he skids his back wheel into a controlled slide. Clearly the bike has a form of braking. An example of which was on all those bikes people of a certain age will remember. And yes, some bikes still have them today*. He uses it throughout the chase scenes. He doesn't have the caliper style brakes which are used by the other messengers, but you know, it's still a brake! In one scene his girlfriend goes flying over the handlebars when she has to brake suddenly. Seeing this Wilee exclaims, ""That's why I don't use brakes."" It's hard for me to believe that profession bike messengers don't understand the concept of what will happen at high speed when you ONLY apply the front brake. I only rant about this brake thing because it is used throughout the film. Wilee doesn't use brakes. Bullspit.Director David Koepp also uses the flashback concept which takes us back to see the set up and add some explanation. It all just seemed unnecessary, especially when we're just talking about 1 day. I also had a hard time understanding why an injured, beaten, confused and demoralized Wilee wouldn't just hop in a cab and take the ticket to its destination if it was so important.One more rant and I promise I'll stop. One of the reviews I read spoke of ""shards"" of glass flying around after the bike messengers collides with a taxi. Sure enough, you can see them in the scene, coming from the vehicle. Well, cars use safety glass or laminated glass on their windows. And yes, they can be dangerous when broken. But they won't unloose ""shards"" of glass. That's why the vehicles have that type of glass. On a positive note, many of the bike tricks are pretty cool. I especially liked one in an impound lot where Wilee jumps his bike all over the place. Should be a good candidate for the next ""X-games"" contest. The acting is fine. After all, they didn't conceive or write this ridiculous script. And certainly, Oscar nominee Michael Shannon hams it up for all he's worth.*I suspect Wilee is using what is known as a fixed gear bike. Technically there are no traditional brakes. In practice, the rider locks the rear wheel by resisting the forward motion of the pedals and crank. This type of bike does not coast. Still, it brakes. The filmmakers give the illusion of an out of control rider with no way to stop.",2,Give me a brake,1351209600,"10 26, 2012",2012,3895,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'trailers', 'movie', 'was', 'thinking', 'Why', 'do', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'bike', 'messengers', 'Then', 'saw', 'reviews', 'were', 'most', 'part', 'positive', 'what', 'hell', 'Well', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'initial', 'deal', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'town', 'flush', 'in-person', 'messenger', 'services', 'quickest', 'delivery', 'method', 'bicycle', 'Evidently', 'small', 'companies', 'are', 'very', 'competitive', 'One', 'such', 'company', 'law', 'school', 'grad', 'Wilee', 'coyote', 'employed', 'arguably', 'fastest', 'most', 'dependable', 'numerous', 'times', ""n't"", 'use', 'bikes', 'gears', 'get', 'More', 'minute', 'Played', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'all-in', 'earnest', 'way', 'Wilee', 'given', 'assignment', 'carry', 'ticket', 'used', 'Chinese', 'money', 'launderers', 'given', '23', 'year', 'old', 'roommate', 'Jamie', 'Chung', 'girlfriend', 'Dania', 'Ramirez', 'worth', '50K', 'be', 'exchanged', '4', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'who', 'being', 'smuggled', 'city', 'China.A', 'crooked', 'cop', 'played', 'relish', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'unusual', 'name', 'Bob', 'Monday', 'opposed', 'Joe', 'Friday', 'Get', 'Bob', 'up', 'eyeballs', 'debt', 'Chinese', 'gangsters', 'gambling', 'losses', 'playing', 'what', 'be', 'pai', 'gow', 'tipped', 'off', 'laundry', 'ticket', 'as', 'good', 'cash', 'rest', 'film', 'chasing', 'Wilee', 'Wilee', 'give', 'up', 'ticket.Back', 'brakes', 'thing', 'Wilee', 'exclamation', 'seemingly', 'dozens', 'times', 'movie', 'why', 'drove', 'crazy', 'early', 'scene', 'traffic', 'skids', 'back', 'wheel', 'controlled', 'slide', 'Clearly', 'bike', 'form', 'braking', 'example', 'was', 'bikes', 'people', 'certain', 'age', 'will', 'remember', 'yes', 'bikes', 'still', 'have', 'today*', 'chase', 'scenes', ""n't"", 'have', 'caliper', 'style', 'brakes', 'are', 'used', 'other', 'messengers', 'know', 'still', 'brake', 'one', 'scene', 'girlfriend', 'flying', 'handlebars', 'when', 'brake', 'suddenly', 'Seeing', 'Wilee', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'brakes', 'hard', 'believe', 'profession', 'bike', 'messengers', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'concept', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'high', 'speed', 'when', 'ONLY', 'apply', 'front', 'brake', 'only', 'rant', 'brake', 'thing', 'used', 'film', 'Wilee', ""n't"", 'use', 'brakes', 'Bullspit.Director', 'David', 'Koepp', 'also', 'flashback', 'concept', 'back', 'see', 'set', 'up', 'add', 'explanation', 'just', 'seemed', 'unnecessary', 'especially', 'when', ""'re"", 'just', 'talking', '1', 'day', 'also', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'understanding', 'why', 'injured', 'beaten', 'confused', 'demoralized', 'Wilee', 'would', ""n't"", 'just', 'hop', 'cab', 'take', 'ticket', 'destination', 'was', 'so', 'important.One', 'more', 'rant', 'promise', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'One', 'reviews', 'read', 'spoke', 'shards', 'glass', 'flying', 'around', 'bike', 'messengers', 'collides', 'taxi', 'Sure', 'enough', 'can', 'see', 'scene', 'coming', 'vehicle', 'Well', 'cars', 'use', 'safety', 'glass', 'laminated', 'glass', 'windows', 'yes', 'can', 'be', 'dangerous', 'when', 'broken', 'wo', ""n't"", 'unloose', 'shards', 'glass', 'why', 'vehicles', 'have', 'type', 'glass', 'positive', 'note', 'many', 'bike', 'tricks', 'are', 'pretty', 'cool', 'especially', 'liked', 'one', 'impound', 'lot', 'where', 'Wilee', 'bike', 'place', 'Should', 'be', 'good', 'candidate', 'next', 'X-games', 'contest', 'acting', 'fine', 'did', ""n't"", 'conceive', 'write', 'ridiculous', 'script', 'certainly', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'hams', 'up', 'worth', '*I', 'suspect', 'Wilee', 'using', 'what', 'known', 'fixed', 'gear', 'bike', 'Technically', 'are', 'traditional', 'brakes', 'practice', 'rider', 'rear', 'wheel', 'resisting', 'forward', 'motion', 'pedals', 'crank', 'type', 'bike', 'not', 'coast', 'Still', 'filmmakers', 'give', 'illusion', 'control', 'rider', 'way', 'stop']",Premium Rush

And I'm a fan of the acting work of both Levitt and Shannon, most notably Shannon in Take Shelter, an all time great performance in a role tailor made for him.If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have rented, and I refuse to justify money and time spent by pretending this is anything more than garbage.

1599501,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B009MO5E10,S. Der,"[22, 31]","***Contain Spoilers***I thought this was an interesting movie. I have never seen such a movie about bike messenger/delivery in New York. Maybe there is another movie like this, but this is the first one I know. If you know another feel free to name it and maybe I watch that one too.I will talk about the action first. There is plenty! All the action is done on the bike, and it's pretty good. The main Male protagonist, Wilee, knows a lot stunts and mixes it up to do all the action scenes. You kind of have to let yourself believe that this one guy that is a bike messenger also knows how to do all these motocross stunts and tricks. But in another way, maybe it does make perfect sense. The way the movie makes out the job of bike messengers, Wilee does need to know all these tricks and stunts just to stay alive doing his job. Seems like bike messengers can be easily killed or serious injured doing what he does everyday by people walking, cars, or anything really on the road. All because they need to ride hard and fast to do their job.What I really liked about the movie was this interesting ""future look"" Wile does. You will see him riding his bike and then he sees a situation where has many choices on the ""paths he could take"". Then, you see how each ""path he could take"" would do. Most of the paths lead him killing himself or getting seriously injured until he figures out, a path he would take that didn't get him killed or injured...most of time that is. It is possible that all paths are just plain bad. lolAnother thing I found interesting about the movie was how it the movie is played/shown to the audience. The movie doesn't follow a total linear path from start to finish. Instead, what it does is shows the audience a point of view (mainly Wilee's point of view) and continues on from there. So, the movie will back up and show you what happened before all of the present/current event and tell you how this character/event happened because of the previous character/event happened. This lets the audiences know why and how the things got the way they were. I was kind of worry about the movie doing this at first because it would slow down the action, but instead it was done right because they mixed in some action scenes with it and kind of speed up things. Bravo!I liked how there was a happy ending at the end. And it wasn't forced either. Many times I would see a movie that had a have a happy ending, but it would seemed possible to get to that happy ending from how they stacked the deck against the protagonist. But, this movie did it right! They stacked the deck against Wilee, but the obsoletes, he had to face actually worked against each other too. Wilee saved the day and end all the whole mess of having a crazy/bad cop chasing him throughout New York for a ticket that had special meaning on it. He had to get it to China Town to and give it to this person named sister Chan. Wilie also has all these other sub problems he has to deal with, but it could be solved easily, but just get away. The main problem is with the cop that needs to get the ticket and pay off his money debts. And Wildly has the ticket. On top of that, the cop has his own problems because if he doesn't get the ticket then he owes too much money to the mobsters to pay back and he would just get killed. This works out for Wilee at the end for a happy ending because he just needs to delivery the ticket to sister Chan and there's no backlash for Wilee. The cop will just die because he did not get the ticket and the mobsters will kill the cop and they don't care about Wilee.Also, a big plus where the story set up for the protagonist to get the girl at the end too and how everything just seemed to fall in the right place in the right way. This seems like a easy tasks to make in a movie, but I seen plenty of movie that ""tries"" to do this, but it doesn't work. This movie made it work!

1599502,A1DUT6O3BWXEJ,B009MO5E10,"Shawn Gordon ""gordy the ghoul""","[0, 0]","There are a lot of great looking bicycle stunts provided in the new thriller Premium Rush, nearly a dozen stunt people are credited with these eye popping visuals that take up a great majority of the movie's running time. The movie has also boasts a good cast to it's disposal, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Michael Shannon lend an air of unexpected respectability and add weight to what on the surface would at least appear to be a generic potboiler.Following the exploits of a Manhattan bike messenger, Wilee (Gordon-Levitt), as in the coyote, who could be a lawyer if he wanted, but can't stand to wear suits and has a need for daredevil thrills that he finds in the New York streets working for about eighty bucks a day. Bobby Monday (Shannon) is a seedy cop who looses a large sum of money at a gambling house in Chinatown, then makes a careless loan and goes across the street to bet and loose at another gambling house.There paths eventually cross when Wilee is entrusted with an envelope from his girlfriend's roommate that Monday wants to get his hands on. The reason is of little importance, this is what ""the master of suspense"" Alfred Hitchcock referred to as ""the McGuffin"", it's what drives the plot, but the audience doesn't particularly care about. The cop is dogged in his pursuit of the package, and thus Wilee, and is willing to chase the young man across the near entirety of the city.Told in more or less real time, the movie is a fully charged and a willing suspense tale that is regrettably underdeveloped, at times tragically routine and far too often silly, resorting to fairly obvious and unconvincing developments. It sizzles at first and then fizzles in the middle. With so much going for it, it would seem a rather surprising stumble.The camerawork by Mitchell Amundsen is the main asset of the film, helping to get the audience into the feel of the chase and the bike messenger lifestyle. If the rest of the movie utilized this sort of skill and adventure this film would really be able to move more and could offer a lot more thrills. As it is the thrills are dangerously few for a thriller. The editing is taunt in the service of tedious direction.The leads could be good too, but are given too little to do, they aren't offered the chance for any depth in their roles. Gordon-Levitt has charisma and in the past has proven to be a capable lead performer, but he just fails to have anything to show here and ends up lacking the necessary spark. Gordon-Levitt has been having an impressive year with solid roles in strong movies like Looper, the Dark Knight Rises and Spielberg's Lincoln, 2012 will be remembered as the year that he came into his own as a star, but at least one of his movies will be completely forgotten. Shannon, a very talented character actor, likewise is good, but his role lacks any meat, he is regrettably just a typical movie bad guy.Directed by David Koepp, one of Hollywood's top screenwriters with credits on blockbusters such as Spider-man, Mission: Impossible, the first two Jurassic Park movies, as well as Angels & Demons and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. As a director, Koepp is a different story though, his credits are by far less impressive including the failed Ricky Gervais vehicle Ghost Town, the Stephen King adaptation Secret Window and something called the Trigger Effect. Premium Rush does nothing to elevate his flagging ambitions as an auteur.Despite a great start, Koepp's script, which seems to be aimed at thirteen year olds, is amongst his worst, chocked full of clich&eacute;s, unlikely developments and some of the most laugh out loud dialogue of the year. Gordon-Levitt's assertion that ""breaks equal death"" is likely be the most memorable part of this whole shamble. It also lacks suspense, the needed tension and a satisfying conclusion. Koepp is known for trouble with third acts, but this time he flounders in beginning of the second.Any attempts at character development is strictly relegated to the realm of clich&eacute;.  Wilee's girlfriend, a fellow rider named Vanessa (Daniela Ramirez) wants him to act more mature and finish his education or she's breaking up with him. Wilee has a rival for Vanessa's attention who's also a hot shot messenger. Then there is the subplot involving human trafficking that is not only under investigated, but all but discarded and when used strictly as a plot devise, it would seem the movie is in favor of this human violation atrocity.Premium Rush feels long for ninety-one minutes and by the mid way point I had had more than enough bicycle chases for one movie and just wanted the whole thing to get on with it's story, but it doesn`t really have one to get on with. Then it develops into a ridicules, sad sack of a final twist of simplistic sappiness.I have an undeniable fondness for a well made action film, I have great admiration for a fine tuned thriller, but Premium Rush is neither, it fails as the most rudimentary escapist entertainment. In the end this all plays out like the Jason Statham Transporter movies at about fifteen miles per hour. Or maybe it's ambitions were just to be training wheels of anarchy.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",3,What's the rush?,1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,5206,"['are', 'lot', 'great', 'looking',

1599517,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B009MO5E10,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[0, 0]","""Premium Rush"", the new film from director David Koepp (""Ghost Town"", ""The Secret Window"") has a lot going for it and one major drawback. But all in all, it's a fun, edge-of-your-seat-type of entertainment and is shaping up to become an underappreciated summer treat.Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a NYC bike messenger, picks up a package from Nima (Jamie Chung, ""The Real World: San Diego"") who has gone to great lengths to secure the contents of the envelope, a movie ticket with a doodle on it. Nima is also the ex-roommate of Wilee's ex-girlfriend Vanessa (Dania Ramirez), so they have a connection and she trusts Wilee more with this very precious package. The envelope must be delivered by 7pm to an address in Chinatown. No problem for Wilee. He seems to make a game out of speeding through the horrible Manhattan traffic, trying to avoid obstacles and make deliveries in a timely manner. He and Vanessa, and the rest of the bike messenger community are closely knit and look out for one another. But there is one big problem; a crooked cop, Bobby Monday (Michael Shannon, ""Take Shelter"", """"Revolutionary Road""), with a huge gambling debt, wants the envelope as well and will do just about anything to get it.Start the clock. Wilee has just about 90 minutes to make the delivery, weaving through the crowded streets of Manhattan. Just under 90 minutes to elude the crooked cop. Just under 90 minutes to save some lives, prevent some deaths and figure out what the hell is going on.Koepp, who co-wrote the screenplay (and wrote, among many others, ""Indiana Jones 4"", ""War of the Worlds"", ""Angels and Demons"") then puts into place a little used and difficult to pull off narrative device; he tells Wilee's story in ""real time"". When a filmmaker chooses to use this device, they usually do so because they want to keep the pace moving and want to heighten the suspense. But this device is rarely used because it is difficult to pull off well. It also adds an inherent problem to the narrative. If everything in the film is happening in real time, how do you establish any of the characters back stories?Koepp gets around these problems in a unique and interesting way. As soon as Wilee gets the package and receives his instructions, the clock starts, appearing on screen at key times. This is done to help keep us grounded in the story, but also to provide a 'ticking clock', ratcheting the tension up a couple of notches. Wilee sets off, speeding through taxis and parked cars, pedestrians and other vehicles, trying to keep one step ahead of a very determined cop who is chasing him. To get around the narrative restrictions, Koepp uses the slow moments, when Wilee is riding without incident, to turn the clock back. The clock pops up on screen and rushes back to an earlier moment illustrating another part of the narrative. When the moment is done, the clock rushes forward again and we pick up where we left off. Koepp doesn't limit this technique just to Gordon-Levitt and allows us to see key moments that occur before the time frame of this film. Basically, the director cheats on the narrative device but does so in a way that still seems natural.The television series ""24"" is a really good example of how this technique can be used successfully in an action story. But even ""24"" cheated. Not everything was told in real time. After commercial breaks, the time suddenly skips forward four or five minutes. What happened during those missed moments? The skill comes when the filmmakers successfully hide the inconsequential, or boring, moments in these time breaks.The real time device, with the clock popping up on screen probably sounds unnatural and obtrusive. Because the film is very graphic heavy, the ticking clock becomes part of the overall look and blends in more. Early on, as Wilee rides through the insane traffic, trying to make his delivery on time, he is suddenly confronted by a huge truck blocking his way. He looks at three different alternatives, trying to figure out which way to go. As he does this, we take on his point-of-view and watch as his mind plots a course through the various obstacles, complete with a yellow arrow and a glimpse at the outcome of each route. As soon as he figures out which way to go, he speeds through.""Premium Rush"" is a plot-driven film; we are watching Wilee navigating various obstacles to make his delivery on time. He has to get from Point A to Point B in a short amount of time or something really bad could happen. The little flashback moments I mentioned earlier help to provide a little back-story to the characters, but these moments illustrate why the characters make decisions that will affect the plot. In doing this, the filmmakers establish ""Rush"" as an action film, a film meant to solely create thrills. And Koepp does this well, so I have no complaints. But I usually prefer character-driven stories.But this plot-driven story robs Gordon-Levitt of the opportunity to create another full-fledged character. He is a fine actor and has created some very memorable films. But he also falls victim to ""Hollywood-itis"". Wilee is, for Gordon-Levitt, the equivalent of Meryl Streep in ""River Wild"". In both instances, a very good actor takes an action movie role in an effort to increase their profile, make them more bankable and push them into another level of stardom. In Gordon-Levitt's case, he seems destined to headline a big budget Hollywood no-brainer; ""Premium Rush"" and the upcoming ""Looper"" seem like stepping stones to that goal. When I think of the actor, I think of ""(500) Days of Summer"", ""The Lookout"", ""50/50"" and ""Inception"". I want to see him in more films like these. We have enough big budget no-brainer films starring over paid 'actors' and don't need to corrupt another fine actor and change him.Michael Shannon, who has been in a ton of films but received a lot of positive press for ""Take Shelter"" and ""Revolutionary Road"", plays the crooked cop Bobby Monday. Unfortunately, he chews up the scenery, playing the role way over the top. And his seemingly unnatural ability to stay in pursuit of Wilee only makes him seem like the Terminator. Because his character is so unnatural, it makes the film seem more cartoonish than it should. And that isn't a great thing for a film like this, a film trying so hard to make everything seem real.The whole story behind the movie ticket is a little overly complex and almost seems unreal. I am sure Koepp has based this on a real practice, but because it is so complicated, it seems out of place. Hitchcock always used a MacGuffin in his films, something the bad guys were after but had little actual connection to the story. It was the reason for the actions of the villain, but once the hero got involved, the interactions between the two sides became the film. In ""North By Northwest"", the MacGuffin is the little statue Vandamm wants to buy at the auction. It contains microfilm, but what that microfilm contains is of little consequence. Because Koepp gives so much emphasis to this movie ticket, and what it means, it becomes an integral part of the film and makes everything seem a little off balance.Koepp has created an exciting, interesting and well-made film with a major flaw. It is well-worth a bargain matinee or DVD rental.",3,Better Than You Might Expect.,1347580800,"09 14, 2012",2012,7279,"['Premium', 'Rush', 'new', 'film', 'director', 'David', 'Koepp', 'Ghost', 'Town',

When I saw he was going to be in an action thriller, about bike messengers in Manhattan, I couldn't wait to see it, but sadly I was very disappointed. It's a normal day for bike messenger Riley (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), as he picks up a package and goes on his way. Everything is fine until a strange man tries to run him down and steal the package. From there its a race through NYC to see who gets the mysterious package first. Premium Rush is Gone In 60 Seconds on bicycles. The plot is weak, the story is predictable, and the whole film is basically one big chase through Manhattan. Yes, Premium Rush is exciting at first, but after a half hour, it gets very tiresome, very quickly. JGL tries his hardest to turn this film into something, but even a star of his caliber can't save this film, because there really isn't anything to save. It's as if the producers said, lets have a car chasing a bike in New York City and develop some kind of story around that. It doesn't work, because seldom I have been this bored and frustrated by an action movie. It stars one of my top 10 favorite actors, but there really isn't much of a role for him to play.

1599519,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B009MO5E10,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[0, 0]","I am a fan of Joseph Gordon -Levitt, even back to `Third Rock from the Sun' because he got to act with the tremendous John Lithgow. Here he takes on the role of Wille (pronounced Wylie as in Wylie Coyote) who is a bicycle courier in New York City. He works for a negotiated price for each gig. He has an on and off sort of relationship with co worker Vanessa (Dania Ramirez - `American Reunion').Well he gets asked to pick up a letter from the University for a mere thirty bucks and get it to a specific address within two hours. First thing that happens is a corrupt cop tries to get it from him, but Wille does a runner or rather heads off in the mad traffic being pursued by Detective Bobby Monday played with pantomime nastiness by Michael Shannon (of the really good `Take Shelter' and the not so really good `Pear Harbor'). Thus we are all set for a high octane chase through Manhattan and I must say the last time I saw this many `horns' getting blown was in a cheap porno.This is a sit back and turn your brain off kind of flick. It is just a full throttle action fest based on bicycles and a few cars getting in the way and ineptly crashing into things. There are also issues around Chinese immigration and the troubles they encounter in order to get into a country - even legally and the culture rift there is between them and the West and it is all handled rather well. There is also the relationship bit which sits quite well within the stories context.Directed by David Koepp who is more famous for his writing abilities but he did direct `Stir of Echoes' and has worked on `Spiderman', `Mission Impossible' and even that last `Indiana Jones and the Crystal Meth' or what ever it was called, but either way the guy clearly has talent.

After being confronted by Bobby Monday (Shannon) about it Wilee begins his delivery, but not everyone wants to see him succeed. I have to admit that I was not really looking forward to this going in. I though, how good can a movie about a guy who rides a bike be? While this is not amazing it is a pretty tense and exciting action movie. The race scenes are fun to watch and seeing how Wilee comes up with his routes is interesting to see. I'm not saying this is really something to rush (get it) out and see but it's not one to pass up if you get the chance. Overall, very entertaining and fun to watch.

The plot was a little thin: bicycle messenger must deliver a letter before a 7:00 pm deadline while being chased by a corrupt cop who wants the letter for himself.  But it was fun, action packed, and the bicycle tricks/culture was a change from the ordinary chase scenes.  The acting was well done, and the characters were interesting.  The corrupt cop was the best of the bunch.  He had this attitude like ""Are you really going to make me kill you?  You know killing you will really spoil my day.  Just do what I want and we will both be happy.""  He was hilarious.Another interesting thing about the movie was the manipulation of the time line.

1599530,AMI8149RXQ0M5,B009MO5E10,Zencik,"[0, 0]","For a film involving the material presented, Premium Rush is actually pretty decent. It's not a great movie, but there's some fun to be had with it.JGL is good as always and Michael Shannon does is fantastic as the over-the-top villain. The film has a great start quickly setting up the plot and getting right into the action. The action scenes and stunt work in the film are excellent and really well choreographed. There are some unique little things the film does as well that I really enjoyed such as the moments where we would see JGL planning out which route he would take next inside his head. It has a nice little B-Movie feel with an 80's vibe which I really dug. There was also a surprisingly amount of funny moments in the film thanks the whole light hearted tone the film takes. It never takes itself too seriously, but it never becomes too silly either.However, Premium Rush flaws take some of the fun out of it. My biggest complaint of the film is the flashback scenes. In the start of the film, we get the idea that it's going to be a non-stop action thrill ride. However, when the film gets toward the 2nd act when the adrenaline gets going, the film stops to fill in the gaps in the story using lengthy and boring flashback sequences that drag on forever. It felt has if the flashback sequences alone took up about a good 20-25 minutes of the films short 90 minute running time which really bothered me. I understand the need to fill in the gaps in the story, but when you throw them in once the adrenaline gets going and they drag on for a good amount of time, it becomes rather frustrating to the viewer. Besides JGL and Shannon, the rest of the acting is pretty bad, especially Jamie Chung who is doing one of the worst Asian accents that I've ever heard. There was also one scene towards the end of the film that felt really out of place considering the film's tone.Overall, Premium Rush isn't that great or even memorable ( I actually forgot about it very quickly after I saw it), but there's enough fun to be had with it to make it worth a viewing. Nothing you need to rush out in see, but it makes for a good viewing on a day you've got nothing better to do and a perfect rental.",3,"Flawed, But Enjoyable",1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,2203,"['film', 'involving', 'material', 'presented', 'Premium', 'Rush', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'it.JGL', 'good', 'always', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'fantastic', 'over-the-top', 'villain', 'film', 'great', 'start', 'quickly', 'setting', 'up', 'plot', 'getting', 'right', 'action', 'action', 'scenes', 'stunt', 'work', 'film', 'are', 'excellent', 'really', 'well', 'choreographed', 'are', 'unique', 'little', 'things', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'such', 'moments', 'where', 'would', 'see', 'JGL', 'planning', 'out', 'route', 'would', 'take', 'next', 'head', 'nice', 'little', 'B-Movie', 'feel', '80', 'vibe', 'really', 'dug', 'was', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'amount', 'funny', 'moments', 'film', 'whole', 'light', 'hearted', 'tone', 'film', 'never', 'too', 'seriously', 'never', 'too', 'silly', 'either.However', 'Premium', 'Rush', 'flaws', 'take', 'fun', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'film', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'start', 'film', 'get', 'idea', 'going', 'be', 'non-stop', 'action', 'thrill', 'ride', 'However', 'when', 'film', '2nd', 'act', 'when', 'adrenaline', 'going', 'film', 'fill', 'gaps', 'story', 'using', 'lengthy', 'boring', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'drag', 'forever', 'felt', 'flashback', 'alone', 'took', 'up', 'good', '20-25', 'minutes', 'films', 'short', '90', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'really', 'bothered', 'understand', 'need', 'fill', 'gaps', 'story', 'when', 'throw', 'once', 'adrenaline', 'going', 'drag', 'good', 'amount', 'time', 'rather', 'frustrating', 'viewer', 'JGL', 'Shannon', 'rest', 'acting', 'pretty', 'bad', 'especially', 'Jamie', 'Chung', 'who', 'doing', 'one', 'worst', 'Asian', 'accents', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'felt', 'really', 'place', 'considering', 'film', 'tone.Overall', 'Premium', 'Rush', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'even', 'memorable', 'actually', 'forgot', 'very', 'quickly', 'saw', 'enough', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'make', 'viewing', 'Nothing', 'need', 'rush', 'out', 'see', 'good', 'viewing', 'day', ""'ve"", 'got', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'perfect', 'rental']",Premium Rush
