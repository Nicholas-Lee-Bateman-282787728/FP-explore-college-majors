Here goes...Dawna of the Dead might be considered an incredibly inventive X rated film or a horribly offensive low budget zombie film.  I think it leans more toward the former.  Great idea, but could have been developed better.Dawna is still grieving over the loss of her boyfriend.  She and her girlfriend head to his burial site and play around with a Ouiji board, in hopes of some sort of connection from beyond the grave.  Their wildest desires are about to take a pounding, as zombies rise up from the earth, anxious to bury their bone.  Sex with the ex has never been this morbid!Up to this point this story is electric.  Absolutely shocking and engaging.  Even with the sub par acting and cheap effects, it is totally mesmerizing.  Not to mention totally erotic.  Seeing beautiful women being violated by these foul, soulless creatures is definitely something to behold.However, somehow these demented acts of perversion become quite tedious.  Maybe it's just me, but I have little desire to sit and watch straight up porn for thirty plus minutes, regardless if zombies are involved.  Eventually some cheap gore effects were added, but for me it was too little too late.Still, Dawna of the Dead is a remarkable cinematic achievement that pushes new boundaries and deserves to be seen.  Surely it will have a divided fan base, and many people will be highly offended.  Not sure what the naysayers were expecting, but hopefully this review gives you a pretty good idea.  Only for the most adventurous of gorehounds.",3,the Undead erected from the grave,1325462400,"01 2, 2012",2012,1578,"['Zombie', 'porn', 'Nuff', 'said', 'Okay', 'need', 'little', 'more', 'info', 'Here', 'Dawna', 'Dead', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'incredibly', 'inventive', 'X', 'rated', 'film', 'horribly', 'offensive', 'low', 'budget', 'zombie', 'film', 'think', 'more', 'former', 'Great', 'idea', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'better.Dawna', 'still', 'grieving', 'loss', 'boyfriend', 'girlfriend', 'head', 'burial', 'site', 'play', 'around', 'Ouiji', 'board', 'hopes', 'sort', 'connection', 'grave', 'wildest', 'desires', 'are', 'take', 'pounding', 'zombies', 'rise', 'up', 'earth', 'anxious', 'bury', 'bone', 'Sex', 'ex', 'never', 'been', 'morbid', 'Up', 'point', 'story', 'electric', 'Absolutely', 'shocking', 'engaging', 'Even', 'sub', 'par', 'acting', 'cheap', 'effects', 'totally', 'mesmerizing', 'Not', 'mention', 'totally', 'erotic', 'Seeing', 'beautiful', 'women', 'being', 'violated', 'foul', 'soulless', 'creatures', 'definitely', 'something', 'behold.However', 'somehow', 'demented', 'acts', 'perversion', 'become', 'quite', 'tedious', 'Maybe', 'just', 'have', 'little', 'desire', 'sit', 'watch', 'straight', 'up', 'porn', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'regardless', 'zombies', 'are', 'involved', 'Eventually', 'cheap', 'gore', 'effects', 'were', 'added', 'was', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late.Still', 'Dawna', 'Dead', 'remarkable', 'cinematic', 'achievement', 'new', 'boundaries', 'deserves', 'be', 'seen', 'Surely', 'will', 'have', 'divided', 'fan', 'base', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'highly', 'offended', 'Not', 'sure', 'what', 'naysayers', 'were', 'expecting', 'hopefully', 'review', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'Only', 'most', 'adventurous', 'gorehounds']",N/A

1408192,A2DKARU8OOUDJV,B004H9ON4E,"M. Bartel ""FAIZ""","[0, 0]","Alright, this movie can be summed up as having potential but failed to hit it's mark.  True, it is porn - and rather average porn at that.  Many of the camera angles are rather dull and you see more ""Mr. Soft Serve"" than female, the guys must have been a bit nervous... i think the concept was good, but having 60 minutes of it being dudes in Halloween masks forcing themselves on females was the wrong approach.  You do not even see a hot female zombie until the last 10 or 12 minutes.  The film would have worked better if the roles were reversed and dudes went to the cemetery and awoke female zombies.  I don't know about any of you, but having zombies rape females isn't a fantasy of mine.  To it's defense, there seemed to be genuine care put into this film.  The atmosphere and set design (though limited) was very good.  The zombie babes were appealing, being make-up and contacts.  I would be eager to see a sequel, if they worked on the camera angles of the sex scenes and tweaked the story so you saw hot zombie chicks from the beginning, not just in the last 2 scenes of the film.  Oh and yes the dudes were in masks, but they were at least decent masks, one even looked like the ""Fulci zombie"" mask - though yet again i didn't pay to see some dudes in masks, i came to see hot zombie babes.... and not just in the promo material!",3,Nice Idea,1348617600,"09 26, 2012",2012,1342,"['Alright', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'having', 'potential', 'failed', 'hit', 'mark', 'True', 'porn', 'rather', 'average', 'porn', 'Many', 'camera', 'angles', 'are', 'rather', 'dull', 'see', 'more', 'Mr.', 'Soft', 'Serve', 'female', 'guys', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'nervous', 'i', 'think', 'concept', 'was', 'good', 'having', '60', 'minutes', 'being', 'dudes', 'Halloween', 'masks', 'forcing', 'females', 'was', 'wrong', 'approach', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'see', 'hot', 'female', 'zombie', 'last', '10', '12', 'minutes', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'roles', 'were', 'reversed', 'dudes', 'went', 'cemetery', 'awoke', 'female', 'zombies', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'having', 'zombies', 'rape', 'females', ""n't"", 'fantasy', 'mine', 'defense', 'seemed', 'be', 'genuine', 'care', 'put', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'set', 'design', 'limited', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'zombie', 'babes', 'were', 'appealing', 'being', 'make-up', 'contacts', 'would', 'be', 'eager', 'see', 'sequel', 'worked', 'camera', 'sex', 'scenes', 'tweaked', 'story', 'saw', 'hot', 'zombie', 'chicks', 'beginning', 'not', 'just', 'last', '2', 'scenes', 'film', 'Oh', 'yes', 'dudes', 'were', 'masks', 'were', 'least', 'decent', 'masks', 'one', 'even', 'looked', 'Fulci', 'zombie', 'mask', 'yet', 'again', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'see', 'dudes', 'masks', 'i', 'came', 'see', 'hot', 'zombie', 'babes', 'not', 'just', 'promo', 'material']",N/A
