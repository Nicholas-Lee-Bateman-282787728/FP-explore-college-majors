I sorely lamented missing the last DVD release, which resulted in having nothing to choose from but some very expensive even used copies floating around once the title was out-of-print or poor quality bootleg copies. I recommend grabbing this release while you can. Max Baer hit on a goldmine with the totally unexpected smash success of the film in 1974. This was especially amazing when you consider that it mainly played on the drive-in circuit during the initial release. Those who only know Max Baer as Jethro Bodine on The Beverly Hillbillies will be in for a great surprise at the vast difference from that comical character and the character he portrays in Macon County Line. The theme song was sung by the lovely Bobbie Gentry of Ode to Billy Joe fame. The only thing that could maybe be better than having this classic film available once again on DVD would be to have the chance to watch it under the stars at a drive-in on a warm summer night. Don't miss it!! But a little bit surprised that this DVD release has no extras at all, not even the original trailer.

Movies like EASY RIDER, BONNIE AND CLYDE, and BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID (at the tail-end of the 60s) had helped to spawn a series of movies that all seemed to start out light-heartedly, but would end in tragedy. Good examples are MACABE AND MRS. MILLER, BOXCAR BERTHA, and, of course, DELIVERANCE. Among these was a little independent film called MACON COUNTY LINE, which concerns two brothers (played by the real-life Vint brothers) who set out on a fun-filled odyssey, only to meet w/ a terrible fate. In keeping w/ it's decade, MCL starts out as a near-comedy, only to spin out of control, ending as a horrific tale of death and revenge. Max Baer wrote, produced, and stars in this classic.

Nothing could be further than the truth.  This film is a snapshot of a time and place in history about two guys in the wrong place.  This could just as well have been contemporary Philadelphia instead of the Jim Crow South in the 1950s.  Director Richard Compton effectively and subtlety captures the mood of the time with oppression percolating beneath the surface.  Max Baer has also crafted a multilayered witty script that belies the way the film was promoted.  Speaking of Baer, he plays the avenging peace officer here but there's more complexity to it.  Baer's character is as sympathetic as the Vint brothers who are the unfortunate victim of circumstance.

1138181,A19PHVY41E0XSU,B0012OX7D0,Dr. O'Boogie,"[2, 3]","After the massive success of Easy Rider in 1969, several sub-genres in film were spawned. You had Biker Films, Hippie/Drug Films and Redneck Roughies. Redneck Roughies were low budget films that took place in the South consisting of car chases, shootouts, rough language and some nudity. Walking Tall is considered one of the top guns in this sub-genre with Macon County Line sitting about redneck-and-redneck with it. In fact, both films share a common actor, a pre-teen idol Leif Garrett.Max Baer, Jr. of Beverly Hillbillies fame attempts to shake off his Jethro Bodine luggage he'd been carrying around since the series cancellation and just about succeeds. As writer, producer and star, he does a good job coming up with a script with a great twist ending. His portrayal of the friendly but bigoted small town sherriff has such depth that you almost forget it's Jethro!The rest of the cast is just as good, the Vint brothers play the happy-go-lucky (maybe not so lucky here) brothers with gusto as well as Joan Blackman as the sassy hitch hiker they pick up. The 2 actors (who's names I can't remember) that play the twisted drifters really unnerve you. Then there's the sherriff's deputy that really chews up the screen in an interrogation scene that will have you gripping the armchair.The story is bascally about being at the wrong place at the wrong time with a startling revelation at the end. Baer had end notes tacked on that give you the impression that this is a true story, but from what I've read this is not true. But true or not, it's still a well written story.Best of my knowledge Baer did only one follow up, the kinder and gentler Redneck Roughie Ode To Billy Jo based on the hit song by Bobbi Gentry. Still, old Max managed to crank out a low budget film that still holds up well today. A definitive classic Redneck Roughie for anybody who likes their films cheap, gritty and intensely well done.",4,Another Great Redneck Roughie,1206230400,"03 23, 2008",2008,1918,"['massive', 'success', 'Easy', 'Rider', '1969', 'several', 'sub-genres', 'film', 'were', 'spawned', 'had', 'Biker', 'Films', 'Hippie/Drug', 'Films', 'Redneck', 'Roughies', 'Redneck', 'Roughies', 'were', 'low', 'budget', 'films', 'took', 'place', 'South', 'consisting', 'car', 'chases', 'shootouts', 'rough', 'language', 'nudity', 'Walking', 'Tall', 'considered', 'one', 'top', 'guns', 'sub-genre', 'Macon', 'County', 'Line', 'sitting', 'redneck-and-redneck', 'fact', 'films', 'share', 'common', 'actor', 'pre-teen', 'idol', 'Leif', 'Garrett.Max', 'Baer', 'Jr.', 'Beverly', 'Hillbillies', 'fame', 'attempts', 'shake', 'off', 'Jethro', 'Bodine', 'luggage', ""'d"", 'been', 'carrying', 'around', 'series', 'cancellation', 'just', 'writer', 'producer', 'star', 'good', 'job', 'coming', 'up', 'script', 'great', 'twist', 'ending', 'portrayal', 'friendly', 'bigoted', 'small', 'town', 'sherriff', 'such', 'depth', 'almost', 'forget', 'Jethro', 'rest', 'cast', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'Vint', 'brothers', 'play', 'happy-go-lucky', 'maybe', 'not', 'so', 'lucky', 'here', 'brothers', 'gusto', 'as', 'well', 'Joan', 'Blackman', 'sassy', 'hitch', 'hiker', 'pick', 'up', '2', 'actors', 'who', 'names', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'play', 'twisted', 'drifters', 'really', 'unnerve', 'Then', 'sherriff', 'deputy', 'really', 'up', 'screen', 'interrogation', 'scene', 'will', 'have', 'gripping', 'armchair.The', 'story', 'bascally', 'being', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'startling', 'revelation', 'end', 'Baer', 'had', 'end', 'notes', 'tacked', 'give', 'impression', 'true', 'story', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'not', 'true', 'true', 'not', 'still', 'well', 'written', 'story.Best', 'knowledge', 'Baer', 'did', 'only', 'one', 'follow', 'up', 'kinder', 'gentler', 'Redneck', 'Roughie', 'Ode', 'Billy', 'Jo', 'based', 'hit', 'song', 'Bobbi', 'Gentry', 'Still', 'old', 'Max', 'managed', 'crank', 'out', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'still', 'up', 'well', 'today', 'definitive', 'classic', 'Redneck', 'Roughie', 'anybody', 'who', 'films', 'cheap', 'gritty', 'intensely', 'well', 'done']",N/A

I wouldn't fault it for occasional slowness in the second half, but where it fails is in its final scenes when the cop and his boy are chasing the two guys and the girl.  We don't see the cop getting shot, nor do we see his son actually kill one of the brothers.  We're left instead with tell-tale impressions - the cop lying dead in the bushes, the dead brother and the boy with the gun in his hands.  But the kid - what is he, 10 years old? - has prior to this demonstrated none of the qualities that would put me to believing he is even capable of this, with the result that by the end of the film I feel a little ripped off as a viewer.  In these critical final scenes the film-maker does more telling rather than showing, as if afraid to give a realistic interpretation, or any interpretation at all, of how ""the facts"" occured.  Bottom line is that the final scenes are very short and unconvincing and didn't leave me with much of an impression of the overall movie.Especially after reading some of the glowing reviews on this listing.This movie had 5-star potential in terms of its actors, location and film style, but while the gun is loaded and ready to shoot, when it finally does, it's shooting blanks.

The Dixon brothers are about to enlist in the military. So they decide to head from Chicago to New Orleans, to have some fun before they report for their induction, in two weeks.The Dixon brothers do have some fun during their journey, and even pick-up a pretty young woman who's hitchhiking. But when their car breaks-down, they have to wait for the repair shop to get the correct parts for it, before they can be on their way. This takes longer than Chris and Wayne figured on. Their troubles really begin though, when the local Sheriff's wife is brutally murdered in their home, and the Sheriff mistakenly thinks Chris and Wayne are the culprits.This story-line in this movie took place in the 1950s, when the deep south could be a particularly dangerous place, for outsiders passing through. It's based on a true story, which makes it even more chilling. Alan and Jesse Vint really project a brotherly chemistry between them with ease. Guess it helps that they're brothers in real life. Max Baer Jr. (know as Jethro from the Beverley Hillbillies) plays the Sheriff with menacing relish. A young Leif Garrett plays the Sheriff's son Luke. Leif shows an amazing emotional fluency, in his role.This film is a cut above many of the drive-in B films, that were so ubiquitous during the 70s when this movie was made. Decent character development, and a plot that's thick with danger and suspense, are the main reasons for this factor.

1138200,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B0012OX7D0,Wuchak,"[1, 1]","""Macon County Line"" belongs to the redneck car/thriller genre, which overlaps with Southern Gothic (e.g. ""The Fugitive Kind"") and redneck car/comedies (e.g. ""Smokey and the Bandit""). Many of these films take place in the South, but not always; there are tons of rednecks all over, even in the most ""progressive"" states, like California and Washington.The plot revolves around two brothers in 1954 traveling through North Carolina. After picking up a lone female, their car breaks down in Macon County where they encounter a bigoted Sheriff. A crime takes place and the sheriff blames the trio.The film only runs 89 minutes and the first hour is all small town tedium, which is part of the movie's low-budget charm, but the third act livens things up.The screenplay was written by Max Baer Jr., best known as Jethro on the Beverly Hillbillies TV series; he also plays the redneck Sheriff in the story. Max, incidentally, directed another redneck classic, 1976's ""Ode to Billy Joe"".The film has a good back country vibe and effectively shows how bigotry and racism are learned traits and not innate. It also shows how easy it is to blame the wrong person due to coincidence. Beyond this, the film has little depth. It's a light drama about mundane events in a small Southern town that turn to tragedy.The movie purports to be based on a true story and offers details to this effect, but this was merely fabricated in order to hype the picture. It worked, as ""Macon County Line"" became a drive-in hit in the mid-70s.My main beef with the film, other than its mundaneness, is that the story takes place in Macon County, North Carolina, but the picture was shot in the Big Valley of California (around Sacramento). It goes without saying, if you're going to film a Southern Gothic thriller that takes place in the South, shoot it in the REAL South, not friggin' California. That said, the filmmakers do a decent job of making it SEEM like the South, dry as California is.GRADE: C+ or B-",3,Redneck drama/thriller from 1974,1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,1981,"['Macon', 'County', 'Line', 'belongs', 'redneck', 'car/thriller', 'genre', 'Southern', 'Gothic', 'e.g', 'Fugitive', 'Kind', 'redneck', 'car/comedies', 'e.g', 'Smokey', 'Bandit', 'Many', 'films', 'take', 'place', 'South', 'not', 'always', 'are', 'tons', 'rednecks', 'even', 'most', 'progressive', 'states', 'California', 'Washington.The', 'plot', 'revolves', 'two', 'brothers', '1954', 'traveling', 'North', 'Carolina', 'picking', 'up', 'lone', 'female', 'car', 'breaks', 'down', 'Macon', 'County', 'where', 'encounter', 'bigoted', 'Sheriff', 'crime', 'place', 'sheriff', 'trio.The', 'film', 'only', '89', 'minutes', 'first', 'hour', 'small', 'town', 'tedium', 'part', 'movie', 'low-budget', 'charm', 'third', 'act', 'things', 'up.The', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Max', 'Baer', 'Jr.', 'best', 'known', 'Jethro', 'Beverly', 'Hillbillies', 'TV', 'series', 'also', 'redneck', 'Sheriff', 'story', 'Max', 'incidentally', 'directed', 'redneck', 'classic', '1976', 'Ode', 'Billy', 'Joe', '.The', 'film', 'good', 'back', 'country', 'vibe', 'effectively', 'how', 'bigotry', 'racism', 'are', 'learned', 'traits', 'not', 'innate', 'also', 'how', 'easy', 'blame', 'wrong', 'person', 'due', 'coincidence', 'Beyond', 'film', 'little', 'depth', 'light', 'drama', 'mundane', 'events', 'small', 'Southern', 'town', 'turn', 'tragedy.The', 'movie', 'purports', 'be', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'details', 'effect', 'was', 'merely', 'fabricated', 'order', 'hype', 'picture', 'worked', 'Macon', 'County', 'Line', 'became', 'drive-in', 'hit', 'mid-70s.My', 'main', 'beef', 'film', 'other', 'mundaneness', 'story', 'place', 'Macon', 'County', 'North', 'Carolina', 'picture', 'was', 'shot', 'Big', 'Valley', 'California', 'Sacramento', 'saying', ""'re"", 'going', 'film', 'Southern', 'Gothic', 'thriller', 'place', 'South', 'shoot', 'REAL', 'South', 'not', 'friggin', 'California', 'said', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'making', 'SEEM', 'South', 'dry', 'California', 'is.GRADE', 'C+', 'B-']",N/A
