1672073,A1TIH8961WXDPE,B00FM4S7P4,James T. Mcgrail,"[1, 2]","I remember my dad laughing himself into a coughing fit at this show. I gobbled up the first three seasons, which were great classic 70s comedy.Season four brought changes however that hurt the show. The loss of Abe Vigoda to an ill-advised spinoff and the addition of Steve Landesberg and Ron Carey as pale replacements. I never got what was so great about Landesberg, his charater was dry and annoying. There was much less of Jack Soo, I assume because of health problems.There were also more 'ripped from the headlines' stories which date the show and make the comedy look forced and preachy.Then there was the inexplicable beginning of Barney's divorce. Which made no sense since Barbara Barrie was no longer a regular on the show.I suppose Danny Arnold was trying to be more 'relevant' like other preachy 70s sitcoms. Real shame.I will be stopping at season four.",3,"Barney Miller, season four",1395187200,"03 19, 2014",2014,867,"['remember', 'dad', 'laughing', 'coughing', 'fit', 'show', 'gobbled', 'up', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'were', 'great', 'classic', '70s', 'comedy.Season', 'four', 'brought', 'changes', 'however', 'hurt', 'show', 'loss', 'Abe', 'Vigoda', 'ill-advised', 'spinoff', 'addition', 'Steve', 'Landesberg', 'Ron', 'Carey', 'pale', 'replacements', 'never', 'got', 'what', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'Landesberg', 'charater', 'was', 'dry', 'annoying', 'was', 'much', 'less', 'Jack', 'Soo', 'assume', 'health', 'problems.There', 'were', 'also', 'more', ""'ripped"", 'headlines', 'stories', 'date', 'show', 'make', 'comedy', 'look', 'forced', 'preachy.Then', 'was', 'inexplicable', 'beginning', 'Barney', 'divorce', 'Which', 'made', 'sense', 'Barbara', 'Barrie', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'regular', 'show.I', 'suppose', 'Danny', 'Arnold', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'more', ""'relevant"", 'other', 'preachy', '70s', 'sitcoms', 'Real', 'shame.I', 'will', 'be', 'stopping', 'season', 'four']",Barney Miller: Season 4

It is odd, however, that Abe Vigoda is featured on the DVD set cover when he only appeared in two episodes (one as a guest star) and co-stars Steve Landesberg and Ron Carey who appeared throughout the season AND in the opening credits are not.
