This is still a good movie, but I noticed its economy in production. This story about a rags-to-riches success will always resonate with an audience. Did it give hope to an America that suffered from escalating gas prices and a devalued dollar? This movie made a star out of Sylvester Stallone.

This story is parallel to Stallone's: The first film was the start of a long and profitable career, the Rocky movies got cornier and cornier (II was OK, III had Mr. T. Enough said. IV had that big Russian guy, a corny ending, and was all-around sappy. V was embarassing. Let's hope VI never gets out of the gate), just like Stallone's movies, and although both series did well at the box office, both were fading artistically and critically. But anyway, this movie is teriffic. Stallone is Rocky Balboa, Carl Weathers is his nemesis, Apollo Creed, and they must face off, because only one can be the champion. Rocky never gives up, even when the odds are a million to one, and the energy from this picture is truly incredible. As some have said, its impossible not to like, and with good reason.

134676,A89MGH1RHEOQN,079283321X,Adam Paul Bailey,"[1, 1]","Rocky is one of the best motion pictures made.Sylvestor Stallone's acting was excellent. Stallone wrote the screenplay for Rocky in just a few days and the producers offered him a hundred thousand dollars for the rights to the screenplay but he turned them down because he wanted to be play Rocky. The producers even went as high as three hundred thousand dollars but his philosophy was that he had managed poverty like a science so to continue living the way he was living didn't matter, but playing Rocky did. On the disc I bought there is a Sylvestor Stallone video commentary and on it he states that originally the producers wanted either Burt Reynolds, Ryan O'Neal or Robert Redford to play Rocky. I think if one of those actors did play Rocky and Sly didn't, I feel that they would've only played him once for some reason and the next time around the producers would have had to find alternate actors for the sequels and that would have reduced the impact of the films.The characters in Rocky are great too. Adrian (Talia Shire), Paulie (Burt Young), Mickey (Burgess Meredith, now unfortunately dead). I suppose I should mention Carl Weathers as Apollo but I liked Tony Burton his trainer more, especially after Stallone mentioned that in an audition with Weathers he said that the producers should get a real actor.I think that not too many films have interesting characters like Rocky.The fight scene in the end is great.Rocky is the story of an underdog who boxes and works for a loan shark as a leg breaker. He pays an extremely shy woman in a petshop visits regularly and eventually they go out on a date and later become man and wife. The woman's brother and Rocky are best friends as they grew up together.Apollo Creed is the World Heavy Weight Boxing Champion of the World and instead of fighting another top ranking boxer he decides to give Rocky, the Italian Stallion a shot at an exhibition bout. Rocky intended on training himself but Mickey, a trainer at the gym where Rocky trains wants to be his manager. Rocky gets a little upset about this at first because he asked for Mickey's help years before but Mickey wasn't interested. But Rocky now agrees to let Mickey manage and train him. We see Rocky getting up at four o clock in the morning and drinking raw eggs out of a glass before going for a run on the mean streets of Philadelphia.When the fight does come he does not win but at least he triumps in the sense he went the distance, lasted all the rounds and gave the champion a good fight.Rocky, the story about a million to one shot who becomes one in a million.",5,Rocky Rocks,1019260800,"04 20, 2002",2002,2590,"['Rocky', 'one', 'best', 'motion', 'pictures', 'made.Sylvestor', 'Stallone', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'Stallone', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Rocky', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'producers', 'offered', 'hundred', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'rights', 'screenplay', 'turned', 'down', 'wanted', 'be', 'play', 'Rocky', 'producers', 'even', 'went', 'as', 'high', 'three', 'hundred', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'philosophy', 'was', 'had', 'managed', 'poverty', 'science', 'so', 'continue', 'living', 'way', 'was', 'living', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'playing', 'Rocky', 'did', 'disc', 'bought', 'Sylvestor', 'Stallone', 'video', 'commentary', 'originally', 'producers', 'wanted', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'Ryan', ""O'Neal"", 'Robert', 'Redford', 'play', 'Rocky', 'think', 'one', 'actors', 'did', 'play', 'Rocky', 'Sly', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'would', ""'ve"", 'only', 'played', 'once', 'reason', 'next', 'time', 'producers', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'find', 'alternate', 'actors', 'sequels', 'would', 'have', 'reduced', 'impact', 'films.The', 'characters', 'Rocky', 'are', 'great', 'too', 'Adrian', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'Paulie', 'Burt', 'Young', 'Mickey', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'now', 'unfortunately', 'dead', 'suppose', 'should', 'mention', 'Carl', 'Weathers', 'Apollo', 'liked', 'Tony', 'Burton', 'trainer', 'more', 'especially', 'Stallone', 'mentioned', 'audition', 'Weathers', 'said', 'producers', 'should', 'get', 'real', 'actor.I', 'think', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'have', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Rocky.The', 'fight', 'scene', 'end', 'great.Rocky', 'story', 'underdog', 'who', 'boxes', 'loan', 'shark', 'leg', 'breaker', 'extremely', 'shy', 'woman', 'petshop', 'regularly', 'eventually', 'go', 'out', 'date', 'later', 'become', 'man', 'wife', 'woman', 'brother', 'Rocky', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'grew', 'up', 'together.Apollo', 'Creed', 'World', 'Heavy', 'Weight', 'Boxing', 'Champion', 'World', 'instead', 'fighting', 'top', 'ranking', 'boxer', 'give', 'Rocky', 'Italian', 'Stallion', 'shot', 'exhibition', 'bout', 'Rocky', 'intended', 'training', 'Mickey', 'trainer', 'gym', 'where', 'Rocky', 'be', 'manager', 'Rocky', 'little', 'upset', 'first', 'asked', 'Mickey', 'help', 'years', 'Mickey', 'was', ""n't"", 'interested', 'Rocky', 'now', 'let', 'Mickey', 'manage', 'train', 'see', 'Rocky', 'getting', 'up', 'four', 'o', 'clock', 'morning', 'drinking', 'raw', 'glass', 'going', 'run', 'mean', 'streets', 'Philadelphia.When', 'fight', 'come', 'not', 'win', 'least', 'sense', 'went', 'distance', 'lasted', 'rounds', 'gave', 'champion', 'good', 'fight.Rocky', 'story', 'million', 'one', 'shot', 'who', 'one', 'million']",N/A

134681,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,079283321X,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 2]","Chuck this up to yet another movie everyone loves that I just don't get.  Okay, so I understand that the whole `underdog' routine is endearing, but I can't see anything truly remarkable or even special about this offering.  There are plenty of films out there that follow this same structure, yet they offer us something more.  You see, when a film is this `simple' it has to be on top of things when it comes to script and acting and really everything else that contributes to the movie watching experience.Sadly, `Rocky' doesn't really offer us that.  The acting is decent in some areas and outright atrocious in others (Oscar nominations for Shire and Young are REPULSIVE to say the least) and the script is average at best.  The shining light here is definitely the direction, because John G. Avildsen manages to keep a gritty, realistic tone with the film that aids in at least making us feel a part of things.  His handling of the boxing scenes are rather inspired I thought, and even though I've seen them done better (by Eastwood and Howard most recently) I have to say that what he did was, for the time, very commendable.I've rallied behind films like `Cinderella Man', which follows a very similar plot, and even boasted it as one of the best films of that year.  The reason being is that, while the plot was `simple' in that it was familiar and none-too-complicated, everything about the film, from the acting to the set pieces to the direction to the character development to the actual script was pristine and nearly flawless.  Even if the plot is simple, the script should allow for the characters and the situations to shine.There are parts of `Rocky' that appear rather lazy to me.So, the story is that of Rocky Balboa; an amateur fighter who gets the break of a lifetime when he's challenged by a big wig in the ring.  So he trains, and he trains, and he trains; hoping to capitalize on this opportunity.  In the process he dates a neighbor, gets into it with her brother, and manages to lift the spirits of those in the community.I'll hand it to Sylvester Stallone, for he actually turned in a decent performance, with moments of real authentic emotional connection.  The fact that he wrote the script aided him tremendously, because he was obviously connected to the project and so that connection bleeds off into his performance.  As far as acting is concerned, he may be the films ONLY shining light, and that is sad since he's not really that great of an actor to begin with.  Burgess Meredith has his moments, and I actually understand his Oscar nomination to a degree, and on some days even agree with it.  Talia Shire and Burt Young are horrendous here and deserve NOTHING, but for some reason pulled out Oscar nominations (and the fact that Shire was placed lead and still got a nom is ridiculous).  Young is the worst thing about this movie.  Talk about overacting, and it wasn't even a fun kind of `hammy'.  Shire is just very green.  She's always been green.

134683,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,079283321X,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","Widely released on 12/3/76 and very much a Christmas film, the story of ROCKY occurs entirely during a holiday season. It begins on November 25th, with club boxer Rocky Balboa barely defeating a ""tomato"" named Spider Rico. Minus ""expenses,"" Rocky's winner's take is a poor day's wage.Holiday connections:1.) There's an argument at Paulie's and Adrian's during Thanksgiving that ends with Paulie Pennino tossing the turkey Adrian prepared into the backyard. This leads to Balboa's first date with terminally shy Adrian: a memorable 10 minutes at an otherwise empty skating rink, then Adrian's tentative visit to Rocky's sad one-room apartment, and their first tender kiss.2.) Just before Christmas, a raging, drunken Paulie throws his sister out for good, and she moves in with Rocky, who's hard in training for the historic and epic Balboa/Creed bout, which takes place at the Philadelphia Spectrum on New Year's Day.ROCKY is in plain terms one of the greatest pictures ever made. For those who weren't there so long ago, you cannot imagine the emotional impact it had on theater audiences, all thanks to the melding of a beautiful love story, intense, skillfully photographed and edited fight scenes, plus perfect music. We were moved by the triumph of a perennial ""loser"" over the odds and his past; we cheered him wildly at story's end. Seeing nearly 30-year-old ""spinster"" Adrian and rudderless Rocky find each other, bond deeply and grow as people was and still is inspiring.By contrast, the only growth that Paulie experiences is the addition to his wardrobe of one garish blue sports jacket, paid for with part of the money he received for selling advertising space on Rocky's ring robe.At times a cartoonish caricature of Muhammad Ali, by the conclusion of their grueling 15 round battle, Apollo Creed seems a very real man, bloodied, exhausted and shaken to the core by the indomitable spirit and pulverizing left hand of his previously unknown opponent, Rocky Balboa.I watch ROCKY every holiday season, and always will.

This dude, the then Italian Will Smith who inherited from Malone Brando's ""On the Waterfront"" style, got a few points right and left there correctly.His was a great start.  A very impressive performance, done with light-hearted touches all over the show.The performance created astounding impression even on boys aged 17 still today.  Amazingly powerful, it foretells the era of changing in American democracy, which perhaps worried this actor since his ""F.I.S.T."" explicitly shared his concerns on the issue.Sylvester Stallone began with this film a torch-carrying career ignited by American pizza makers--the Italian Americans and other Italian American actors and actresses.  A career only recently showed explicitly with his participation at the Olympic torch carrying of 2004.Long way he ran, and long way still people needed to run following him, between that 1818 apartment room till the statue erected Philly Museum of Art.Sylvester Stallone is no commoner in creed, and one ought not to evaluate and assess this person on the base of rules set by the WASP on commoners who suffocated under its people-fooling political philosophy.Shame goes to the WASP elites who only knew how to conquor and to do that rapidly.  Cheers to Sylvester Stallone.  Whose role in the American Democratization is no smaller than that played by Martin Luthur King.Long Live Sylvester Stallone.

Apollo Creed, a fighter with the class and style of Muhammad Ali, needs a boxer in the heavyweight championships when his opponent breaks his hand. He chooses Rocky, an unknown fighter with a marketable nickname, ""The Italian Stallion.""Rocky is just a decent boxer from Philly who could have achieved something if he had more drive. He lives a futile life of discouragement, surviving on hard work and honor. He's a collection agent for a loan shark, and tries, even then, to treat his clients right, giving them the chance to pay up.When Creed makes his offer to Rocky, Rocky realizes this is his door to freedom, to all he has dreamed of reaching. Creed, though, is the best, and Rocky knows it. He trains hard, but can't forget how good Creed is. His goal isn't to win; that seems unachievable. It is to go the distance, to last through every round. No one ever lasted that long with Creed.Subplots that help provide depth are his love interest with Adrian, perfectly played by Talia Shire, and Paulie's (Adrian's brother) temper and sense of feeling disenfranchised. Burgess Meredith as Rocky's trainer, Mickey, is a stereotypically sour old man who talks in rough phrases from one side of his mouth who sees Rocky as the embodiment of his own failed dreams.Rocky's relationship with Adrian is classy. He is a gentleman, albeit simple, and even slept on the couch when Adrian stayed at his place. That kind of class is refreshing to see.Meredith, perhaps best known until this as the Penguin on the 1960s' Batman TV series, is a great compliment to Sylvester Stallone's Rocky, bringing a father-like wisdom and care to their relationship.Stallone's own comment on Rocky says it is, ""All about: pride, reputation, and not being another bum in the neighborhood."" I saw it as an American dream. He worked hard, had a dose of luck, and when it mattered, was all heart.The music is as strong as the movie. High school bands played the ""Rocky Theme"" by Bill Conti for many years. Watching Rocky's workouts, especially the running and pushup scenes, is inspiring. Mixed with the music, you might catch yourself suiting up and hitting the streets for a few miles after the final credits roll.I fully recommend ""Rocky.""Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com",5,Inspiring as Rocky Tries to Go the Distance,1109894400,"03 4, 2005",2005,2327,"['Rocky', 'Balboa', 'now', 'icon', 'American', 'culture', 'began', 'story', 'here', 'Apollo', 'Creed', 'fighter', 'class', 'style', 'Muhammad', 'Ali', 'boxer', 'heavyweight', 'championships', 'when', 'opponent', 'hand', 'Rocky', 'unknown', 'fighter', 'marketable', 'nickname', 'Italian', 'Stallion', 'Rocky', 'just', 'decent', 'boxer', 'Philly', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'achieved', 'something', 'had', 'more', 'drive', 'futile', 'life', 'discouragement', 'surviving', 'hard', 'work', 'honor', 'collection', 'agent', 'loan', 'shark', 'tries', 'even', 'then', 'treat', 'clients', 'right', 'giving', 'chance', 'pay', 'up.When', 'Creed', 'offer', 'Rocky', 'Rocky', 'door', 'freedom', 'dreamed', 'reaching', 'Creed', 'best', 'Rocky', 'hard', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'how', 'good', 'Creed', 'goal', ""n't"", 'win', 'unachievable', 'go', 'distance', 'last', 'round', 'one', 'ever', 'lasted', 'long', 'Creed.Subplots', 'help', 'provide', 'depth', 'are', 'love', 'interest', 'Adrian', 'perfectly', 'played', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'Paulie', 'Adrian', 'brother', 'temper', 'sense', 'feeling', 'disenfranchised', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'Rocky', 'trainer', 'Mickey', 'stereotypically', 'sour', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'rough', 'phrases', 'one', 'side', 'mouth', 'who', 'Rocky', 'embodiment', 'own', 'failed', 'dreams.Rocky', 'relationship', 'Adrian', 'classy', 'gentleman', 'albeit', 'simple', 'even', 'slept', 'couch', 'when', 'Adrian', 'stayed', 'place', 'kind', 'class', 'refreshing', 'see.Meredith', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'Penguin', '1960s', 'Batman', 'TV', 'series', 'great', 'compliment', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Rocky', 'bringing', 'father-like', 'wisdom', 'care', 'relationship.Stallone', 'own', 'comment', 'Rocky', 'pride', 'reputation', 'not', 'being', 'bum', 'neighborhood', 'saw', 'American', 'dream', 'worked', 'hard', 'had', 'dose', 'luck', 'when', 'mattered', 'was', 'heart.The', 'music', 'as', 'strong', 'movie', 'High', 'school', 'bands', 'played', 'Rocky', 'Theme', 'Bill', 'Conti', 'many', 'years', 'Watching', 'Rocky', 'workouts', 'especially', 'running', 'pushup', 'scenes', 'inspiring', 'Mixed', 'music', 'might', 'catch', 'suiting', 'up', 'hitting', 'streets', 'few', 'miles', 'final', 'credits', 'roll.I', 'fully', 'recommend', 'Rocky', 'Anthony', 'Trendleditor', 'HungarianBookstore.com']",N/A

It is always a cheerful film to watch every time. How can anyone show antipathy for this film? Anyway, the film is deemed to be great for the following two reasons: great acting and great direction. Without them, Rocky wouldn't be Rocky.12/05: Rocky is a very inspiring movie. The concept of the story and the story behind the movie are the same. The film that made Sylvester Stallone an overnight mega-star. If anything I could commend the Academy Awards, it's the award of the Best Picture for Rocky. The film truly deserves the prize. Superb acting comes out out of Stallone, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, Burgess Meredith, and Talia Shire. It's a multi-emotional movie for me, showing Philadelphia in a very realistic way. The ""Gonna Fly Now"" scene where Rocky does his training regimen and runs to the top of the steps at the Philadelphia Art Museum always gets me every time I see it. It's a sport story, then a romantic story, and finally a heroic story, definitely of a Greek style. I applaud Stallone's creativity and efforts that he poured into this film. Rocky will always stand out as one of the most thrilling movies for ages.5/11: I had to see Rocky again because it's such an phenomenal film. The best part of the movie is always the training scene with the music Gonna Fly Now. Then, the next one is the superfight between Rocky Balboa and Apollo Creed. That one is the stuff of classics. The seriousness leading to the bout is a must-see. Anyway, I could never get tired of watching Rocky or any of its sequels.

It appears that his future will be as dreary and hopeless as his present, until the day that world heavyweight boxing champion Apollo Creed, in a wild, headline grabbing publicity stunt, declares his intention to fight an unknown in his next title bout and selects Rocky as his partner.  Supremely confident of his own ability and skeptical about Rocky's, Creed doesn't take the spar seriously.But Rocky realises that not only does this grant him the opportunity to fight for the greatest sporting title in the world, but more importantly, with it will come the chance to gain love, confidence, self respect, a purpose, and a chance to rise above the bleakness which has engulfed his life thus far.  Rocky isn't aiming to defeat Creed, stating simply, &quot;All I want is to go the distance.&quot;  And in 1 of the most exciting boxing sequences ever filmed, he does just that.Written in 3 days and filmed rapidly on a limited budget, this film has become 1 of the most beloved cinema classics in history.  It made a star out of Sylvester Stallone (which, depending on your viewpoint, is either a good or bad thing), earned 3 Oscars and global acclaim.  Never before or since has a movie character been so likeable or easy to identify with as Rocky Balboa.  He is a character for whom viewers will be rooting for from the film's humble beginnings to its dramatic climax!",5,Packs a punch!,973555200,"11 7, 2000",2000,1843,"['quot', 'Rocky', 'quot', '1st', 'series', '5', 'motion', 'pictures', 'eternal', 'Italian', 'underdog', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'who', 'won', 'hearts', 'dollars', 'moviegoers', 'worldwide.Living', 'meaningless', 'life', 'Philadelphia', 'ghettos', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'existence', 'as', 'aimless', 'piece', 'driftwood', 'floating', 'down', 'Nile', 'living', 'legbreaker', 'slick', 'suburban', 'loan', 'shark', 'small', 'time', 'pugilist', 'fighting', 'dollars', 'sweaty', 'smoke', 'filled', 'gymnasiums', 'future', 'will', 'be', 'dreary', 'hopeless', 'present', 'day', 'world', 'heavyweight', 'boxing', 'champion', 'Apollo', 'Creed', 'wild', 'headline', 'grabbing', 'publicity', 'stunt', 'intention', 'fight', 'unknown', 'next', 'title', 'bout', 'Rocky', 'partner', 'Supremely', 'confident', 'own', 'ability', 'skeptical', 'Rocky', 'Creed', ""n't"", 'take', 'spar', 'seriously.But', 'Rocky', 'not', 'only', 'grant', 'opportunity', 'fight', 'greatest', 'sporting', 'title', 'world', 'more', 'importantly', 'will', 'come', 'chance', 'gain', 'love', 'confidence', 'respect', 'purpose', 'chance', 'rise', 'bleakness', 'engulfed', 'life', 'thus', 'far', 'Rocky', ""n't"", 'aiming', 'defeat', 'Creed', 'stating', 'simply', 'quot', 'want', 'go', 'distance.', 'quot', '1', 'most', 'exciting', 'boxing', 'sequences', 'ever', 'filmed', 'just', 'that.Written', '3', 'days', 'filmed', 'rapidly', 'limited', 'budget', 'film', 'become', '1', 'most', 'beloved', 'cinema', 'classics', 'history', 'made', 'star', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'depending', 'viewpoint', 'good', 'bad', 'thing', 'earned', '3', 'Oscars', 'global', 'acclaim', 'movie', 'character', 'been', 'so', 'likeable', 'easy', 'identify', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'character', 'whom', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'rooting', 'film', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'dramatic', 'climax']",N/A
134691,A2582KMXLK2P06,079283321X,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","I really like the original Rocky movie.  I forgot how amazing the writing is.I mean, come on- it's about a boxer who has to compete in the biggest match of his life thus far in his young and already pretty beat-up career.  How can you make a great storyline out of a rather lackluster idea?By having the story focus significantly on the boxers life, and by featuring a steady and quiet storyline build-up to please those of us who love a good drama, and even include a charming quality in the atmosphere along with great character development by everyone involved in the film.Sylvester Stallone may be the main character, but all the other characters are equally terrific.  It's nice to have some variety.The portion of the film dealing with Rocky getting to know Adrian was well-executed, and perhaps even better than the boxing match itself.  Absolutely great writing material.  Adrian is such a shy woman, in fact, more shy than I've EVER seen a woman before, and that kind of personality appeals to me personally.This is the film where we learn about all the characters that would make more appearances and play major parts in future Rocky movies.  Most of the movie focuses on getting to know the characters, and less on the fight itself (even the dramatic build-up to the fight was short and sweet).The boxing match itself was fun to watch, though I wish the writers would have included a bit more of the match itself, instead of skipping ahead several rounds.  I won't reveal who won the fight, but you might get the same impression I did over who really won the fight based on the amount of material we see.So yeah, the film is obviously dated a bit, Sylvester Stallone is quite young here, the movie does a tremendous job showing viewers what it's like to wander down the dark, empty streets of Philadelphia in the middle of the night, and this movie is just the beginning of what would deservedly become a classic film series over the years.",5,awesome,1258156800,"11 14, 2009",2009,1951,"['really', 'original', 'Rocky', 'movie', 'forgot', 'how', 'amazing', 'writing', 'is.I', 'mean', 'come', 'on-', 'boxer', 'who', 'compete', 'biggest', 'match', 'life', 'thus', 'far', 'young', 'already', 'pretty', 'beat-up', 'career', 'How', 'can', 'make', 'great', 'storyline', 'rather', 'lackluster', 'idea', 'having', 'story', 'focus', 'significantly', 'boxers', 'life', 'featuring', 'steady', 'quiet', 'storyline', 'build-up', 'please', 'who', 'love', 'good', 'drama', 'even', 'include', 'charming', 'quality', 'atmosphere', 'great', 'character', 'development', 'everyone', 'involved', 'film.Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'may', 'be', 'main', 'character', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'equally', 'terrific', 'nice', 'have', 'variety.The', 'portion', 'film', 'dealing', 'Rocky', 'getting', 'know', 'Adrian', 'was', 'well-executed', 'perhaps', 'even', 'better', 'boxing', 'match', 'Absolutely', 'great', 'writing', 'material', 'Adrian', 'such', 'shy', 'woman', 'fact', 'more', 'shy', ""'ve"", 'EVER', 'seen', 'woman', 'kind', 'personality', 'appeals', 'personally.This', 'film', 'where', 'learn', 'characters', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'appearances', 'play', 'major', 'parts', 'future', 'Rocky', 'movies', 'Most', 'movie', 'getting', 'know', 'characters', 'less', 'fight', 'even', 'dramatic', 'build-up', 'fight', 'was', 'short', 'sweet', '.The', 'boxing', 'match', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'wish', 'writers', 'would', 'have', 'included', 'bit', 'more', 'match', 'instead', 'skipping', 'ahead', 'several', 'rounds', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'who', 'won', 'fight', 'might', 'get', 'same', 'impression', 'did', 'over', 'who', 'really', 'won', 'fight', 'based', 'amount', 'material', 'see.So', 'yeah', 'film', 'obviously', 'dated', 'bit', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'quite', 'young', 'here', 'movie', 'tremendous', 'job', 'showing', 'viewers', 'what', 'wander', 'down', 'dark', 'empty', 'streets', 'Philadelphia', 'middle', 'night', 'movie', 'just', 'beginning', 'what', 'would', 'deservedly', 'become', 'classic', 'film', 'series', 'years']",N/A
134692,A1BJOEQSRX2IBM,079283321X,"Bertin Ramirez ""justareviewer""","[0, 0]","Believe it or not, Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay in 3 days because of financial problems. He then went on to create an American Icon; Roky Balboa, The 'Italian Stalion', and also went to the record books for  being one of the few actors to be nominated for screenplay and actor in the  same year (Orson Welles and Charlie Chaplin were the only others up to  1976). Great supporting cast featuring Burt Young who has his best role as  'Paulie', Burgess Meredith who got his smash hit after 120 movies, and  Talia Shire who is a great character actress, makes 'Adrian' a complex and  multi-layered character, Carl Weathers is also great as the cocky 'Apollo  Creed'. The real magic behind Rocky are John G. Avildsen and Sylvester  Stallone, who toguether make this a nostalgic experience and the best and  most succesful sleeper of all-time. The final fight is a technical marvel,  editing, choreography and cinematography are great. One of the most famous  scores of all-time.

134695,A1YB29BIDULEYE,079283321X,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[0, 0]","This is one of the rare movies that could have stood well on its  own, but ended up being just the 1st chapter. Generally speaking, I don't like Hollywood heroes. But this is one exception. it works because Rocky is human and real. (Granted, a great deal of the credit certainly belongs to Director John Avildsen who has a real talent for artistic beauty and realism. I consider him 2nd only to Franco Zeffirelli and John Badham.)Moving on, this story focuses on a down on his luck everyman (Rocky). the opening scene is effective as Rocky takes part in a brutal club boxing match. he gets injured for $65. and right away, we see that he actually only gets $43. (due to club fees) We later learn that he works as an enforcer for a loan shark named Tony Gazzo. Rocky reveals his human side when he violates Gazzo's orders, and refuses to break a very scared late payer's thumb.Moving on, Rocky has is eyes on his friend Paul's sister Adrian. It is interesting that instead of showing herself to be the beautiful woman she is, Talia Shire makes Adrian look almost geeky. This works in making the human Rocky attracted to a less than perfect woman. She is notably reluctant and shy, and rocky wins her affection by being kind to her. (Not using wicked seduction techniques that Hollywood often glorifies.) the scene where he takes her skating and tells her about himself is a scene of artistic beautyLater, the current boxing champ (Apollo Creed) runs into some hard luck. His big fight has been called off because the top contender has medical problems. Rather than calling everything off, the clever Apollo Creed decides to give an unknown a chance. (Guess who gets it!) While this movie leads us into cheering for Rocky, we really have no reason to dislike Apollo.Moving on, trainer Mickey didn't really like rocky because he chose to work for Loan Shark Tony Gazzo. But they put their differecnes aside, and Mickey trains Rocky hoping to keep him away from dirty parts of the business. It is interesting that as the movie goes on, Rocky's former  boss Tony Gazzo starts to show some redeeming qualities. (Perhaps John Avildsen was trying to show that good will can be contagious!)After some beautifully filmed training sequences, Rocky realizes that while he will certainly make the most of his chance, it's unrealistic to think he can beat Apollo. But that's alright. While we live in a society and age that doesn't look well on 2nd best, Rocky points out that winning is not important. What IS important is doing your best. Adults often teach it to children, but don't seem to believe it themselves!The final fight between Apollo and Rocky is done surprisingly and artfully well without being overly brutal. If you like this movie, the sequels are for the most part impressive. 2 picks up where 1 left off and is one of my favorites; 3 gives us a surprisingly well done story in that Rocky wins the approval of the former champ; I didn't much like 4, but it does have the theme of technology vs the human spirit; 5 focuses on deception and remains one of my favorites. I understand 5 was not so popular, but then Rocky realized the importance of going the distance against the odds, so against my odds, I'll hold to my view that 5 is one of the best.",4,Both a Classic and a Beginning,1171324800,"02 13, 2007",2007,3253,"['one', 'rare', 'movies', 'could', 'have', 'stood', 'well', 'own', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'just', '1st', 'chapter', 'Generally', 'speaking', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Hollywood', 'heroes', 'one', 'exception', 'Rocky', 'human', 'real', 'Granted', 'great', 'deal', 'credit', 'certainly', 'Director', 'John', 'Avildsen', 'who', 'real', 'talent', 'artistic', 'beauty', 'realism', 'consider', '2nd', 'only', 'Franco', 'Zeffirelli', 'John', 'Badham', 'Moving', 'story', 'down', 'luck', 'everyman', 'Rocky', 'opening', 'scene', 'effective', 'Rocky', 'part', 'brutal', 'club', 'boxing', 'match', 'injured', '65', 'right', 'away', 'see', 'actually', 'only', '43', 'due', 'club', 'fees', 'later', 'learn', 'enforcer', 'loan', 'shark', 'named', 'Tony', 'Gazzo', 'Rocky', 'human', 'side', 'when', 'Gazzo', 'orders', 'break', 'very', 'scared', 'late', 'payer', 'thumb.Moving', 'Rocky', 'eyes', 'friend', 'Paul', 'sister', 'Adrian', 'interesting', 'instead', 'showing', 'be', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'Adrian', 'look', 'almost', 'geeky', 'making', 'human', 'Rocky', 'attracted', 'less', 'perfect', 'woman', 'notably', 'reluctant', 'shy', 'rocky', 'wins', 'affection', 'being', 'kind', 'Not', 'using', 'wicked', 'seduction', 'techniques', 'Hollywood', 'often', 'scene', 'where', 'skating', 'scene', 'artistic', 'beautyLater', 'current', 'boxing', 'champ', 'Apollo', 'Creed', 'hard', 'luck', 'big', 'fight', 'been', 'called', 'off', 'top', 'contender', 'medical', 'problems', 'Rather', 'calling', 'everything', 'off', 'clever', 'Apollo', 'Creed', 'give', 'unknown', 'chance', 'Guess', 'who', 'movie', 'cheering', 'Rocky', 'really', 'have', 'reason', 'dislike', 'Apollo.Moving', 'Mickey', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'rocky', 'chose', 'work', 'Loan', 'Shark', 'Tony', 'Gazzo', 'put', 'differecnes', 'aside', 'Mickey', 'Rocky', 'hoping', 'keep', 'away', 'dirty', 'parts', 'business', 'interesting', 'movie', 'Rocky', 'former', 'boss', 'Tony', 'Gazzo', 'show', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'Perhaps', 'John', 'Avildsen', 'was', 'trying', 'show', 'good', 'will', 'can', 'be', 'contagious', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'training', 'sequences', 'Rocky', 'will', 'certainly', 'make', 'most', 'chance', 'unrealistic', 'think', 'can', 'beat', 'Apollo', 'alright', 'live', 'society', 'age', ""n't"", 'look', 'well', '2nd', 'best', 'Rocky', 'out', 'winning', 'not', 'important', 'What', 'IS', 'important', 'doing', 'best', 'Adults', 'often', 'teach', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'believe', 'final', 'fight', 'Apollo', 'Rocky', 'done', 'surprisingly', 'artfully', 'well', 'being', 'overly', 'brutal', 'like', 'movie', 'sequels', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'impressive', '2', 'where', '1', 'left', 'off', 'one', 'favorites', '3', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'done', 'story', 'Rocky', 'approval', 'former', 'champ', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', '4', 'have', 'theme', 'technology', 'human', 'spirit', '5', 'focuses', 'deception', 'one', 'favorites', 'understand', '5', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'popular', 'then', 'Rocky', 'realized', 'importance', 'going', 'distance', 'odds', 'so', 'odds', ""'ll"", 'hold', 'view', '5', 'one', 'best']",N/A

The film, itself, has its own one-in-a-million-shot story to it as well.Stallone wrote this very  quickly(I have heard he wrote this in less than a week).Film is actually  low budget with(at the time) no big name stars(well maybe Burgess  &quot;TWILIGHT ZONE&quot; Meredith), and it became the top-moneymaker of  1976 winning the best best picture oscar!  I have said in my title that  there should not have been sequels spawned from this one. The weakness of  the sequels, though they are good pop &amp; bubble gum entertainment, is  that the sequels rely too much on just the &quot;fight&quot;. The first  installment is about the people involved. It is a good love story, it is a  good human drama. The fight does not come until the end(although there is a  brief fight scene in a hole-in-the-wall club after the opening credits  ROCKY roll), and in the meantime we are treated to how the title character  lives day-to-day surviving on the streets as a loan shark for ogranized  crime while fighting as a &quot;ham and egger&quot; in clubs. It is nice to  see that our hero is not perfect. He is, of course, flawed and that works  here so well. Rocky is not clean-shaven all-American boy as he is a street  tough living in the lower East side of Philadelphia with links to organized  crime. The character of his oppponent(Carl Weathers) is not really ever  developed much here, and that is important because, again, it is not the  fight that is the focus of the film, although the fight scene is very  exciting(make-up man should have won an oscar). This is an exceptionally  well-written film and the actors serve the story beautifully. These are  real, blue-collar types that is so wonderful to see as opposed to straight,  white-teethed perfect looking model types in other hollywood films. It is a  moving human drama that unfolds before us.  There are moments of  pounding excitement in the fight scenes, there are triumphant  lump-in-throat scenes such as the famous final bell scene where all Rocky  cares about is being reunited with his shy girlfriend(Talia Shire), there  are embarrasingly funny moments like the ice-skating scene, exciting  training scenes set to the top-40 hit Gonna Fly Now.

It seems like each one becomes a paler imitation of the first.  This movie spends a great deal of time setting up the relationship between Rocky and Adrian.  They learn to help each other learn to believe in themselves.Unlike the other Rocky movies, which are all inferior to the original, the fight sequences are only at the beginning and end of the movie.  Most of the movie is spent establishing Rocky's character and developing his attachment to Adrian and their joint relationship with Adrian's brother, Paulie.  I still love the names for Rocky's two turtles, Cuff &amp; Link.The acting in the movie is actually quite tender.  For example, when Paulie, Adrian, and Rocky are watching the press conference with Apollo Creed announcing the fight, the promoters treat Rocky as more of a joke than a contender.  Paulie points this out to Rocky, and Rocky says that ""it don't bother me none"".  Rocky wants to focus on his saying hi to Adrian on the TV.  However, as Rocky is leaving he and Adrian briefly discuss how she felt about hearing her name on TV.  He then asks her if she remembers him saying that what the promoters said didn't bother him.  She says she does.  He looks down the street and while barely moving his mouth says, ""It did"" and walks away.Not Shakespeare, but quite human.And the movie is filled with great lines from Burgess Meredith's creation of Mickey while he his training Rocky for this impossible fight in five weeks.  Mickey is another loser looking for his break - his one shot.  Everyone remembers Mickey from this movie.This movie also launched Carl Weathers who does a fine job as Apollo Creed.That it won the Oscar for best picture is a testament to the mood of the times, but even after all these years, it is a movie with impact.

Markel,"[2, 8]","This review is for the 2001 MGM Special Edition DVD release.I just recently saw the ""Special Edition"" DVD 28 years later after seeing it in the theater.  When I saw it in the theater as a senior in high school in 1977, it seemed exhilarating and inspiring.  Perhaps it was because it was art imititating real life: a virtual unknown actor makes an Oscar winning film against all odds.Seeing the DVD in 2005, it lacked a lot of punch, credibility and it seemed very hard to connect to the characters.  The first thing that stood out for me was how much of a neanderthal the Rocky character was played by Sylvester Stallone.  The rest of the characters from his neighborhood were not that far behind on the IQ scale either and the dialogue was dreadfully painful and boring to sit through.  Then there was the preposterous premise of an old, washed up boxer who fights in a recreational center of a neighborhood church getting a shot at a world title fight.  The only truly great segment in this film is the last 25 minutes which includes the classic training scene through the streets and landmarks of Philadelphia complemented the outstanding music of Bill Conti playing the Rocky Theme.  The final fight scenes also hold up well and the outcome does have it merits since it bucked a predictable ending.  Perhaps its the four mediocre and unneeded sequels that may have subconsciously poisoned my enjoyment of this film recently.The DVD transfer lacked the razor sharpness one is used to seeing on DVD.  Perhaps it was because it was a low budget film and the master copy lacked sharpness.

Philadelphians being stuck between New York and Washington have a strong sense of pride but also have something of an inferiority complex.  When this film about the ultimate underdog getting a shot at the heavyweight title won best picture at the Oscars the city went nuts.  Back then they used to platform movies and they would play for months.  First they played at upscale theatres(downtown Philly) and after that they came into the neighborhoods(there were few multiplexes).  The film came out around Christmas and didn't come to our neighborhood until May, 1977.  We waited months for it and when it came to our neighborhood the lines were around the block.  Naturally, I saw this film about 3 or 4 times and would unquestionably love it.  Subsequent sequels and lousy Stallone films(Cobra, Judge Dredd, etc.) cooled me to this film.  I did not revisit this film until it's DVD release and was pleasantly surprised.  This is a gritty little film with a lot of heart unlike it's sequels which are slick and soulless.  This is not the best directed or acted film in the world and the dialogue is corny at times, but that is part of the film's charm.  I get nostalgic when I see Philadelphia as it was in the Bicentennial year, some that still exists and some things that aren't here anymore.

Small is beautiful is a concept that can also apply to this art form. Sylvester Stallone (The Lords of Flatbush) wrote the screenplay and plays the lead in this movie. In an interview, he has stated: ""I think the primary objective of creative art - of film art - is to create these simplistic stories that touch everyone and affect their lives through giving them heroes, through answering questions.""The hero we get in Rocky is ""the Italian Stallion,"" a hard-muscled southpaw boxer who's not bad enough to quit and not good enough to make it into the big time. A trainer at the gym in the Philadelphia slum where he lives tells him: ""You're a tomato...You got the heart but you fight like an ape."" In his spare time, Rocky works as a heavy for a loan shark. But he can't even bring himself to break the thumb of a client since he knows the man may be worse off than he is. Rocky's heart goes out to Adrian, an ugly duckling who blooms under the nurturance of his love. She becomes devoted to him.Fate tips its hat when Apollo Creed, the heavyweight champ, chooses him as his replacement opponent in a special contest to celebrate the Bicentennial. No one believes that Rocky has a chance. But he surprises everyone including himself. Sylvester Stallone's performance is sheer magic - an authentic and touching portrait of a loser who becomes a winner in the things that matter. Talia Shire is excellent as Adrian; Burgess Meredith, mangy as his manager; and Burt Young, good as Adrian's touchy brother. John Avildsen's direction is a tour de force of style and substance.Not only does Rocky give us a memorable hero, but as Stallone promised it answers basic questions. Is it worth sticking with one's dreams? Yes, no matter what. Is winning the most important thing in a contest? No, it's the courage to go the distance with the best that one's got that counts. Is success the highest achievement? No, love matters much more.

The Blu-ray edition of Rocky is an upgrade from the DVD version, but not by much.  The quality of the visuals varies from scene to scene.  Sometimes it is relatively clear and sharp.  Other times it is excessively grainy.  The color saturation is also a bit weak--it has a washed-out look to it.  The sound is problematic as well.  The actors sound at times like they are speaking into tin cans.  Some of the boxing effects are very weak, to the point of distraction.  The soundtrack is good, however.  My guess is that they did not have good source material for this transfer.  It does not appear to have been restored or remastered.If you already have the DVD and are considering an upgrade, the relatively slight improvement in visuals might not be worth the cost.  My rating of five stars is for the movie.  If I were only rating the video/audio, it would only get two stars.

Of all the thrilling, inspiring, &quot;feel good&quot; underdog movies out there, ROCKY rates as one of the best.  The movie that put Sylvester Stallone on the celebrity map (unfortunately), ROCKY still entertains some three decades after its initial, Academy Award-winning run.We all know the story:  Rocky Balboa, an undisciplined club brawler and strong-arm collection man from the slums of Philadelphia, gets a once-in-a-lifetime shot at boxing's heavyweight title.  Yet the upcoming fight is merely the trimming surrounding the story; ROCKY is about a humble man with a heart of gold--a man who confronts his shortcomings and insecurities to evolve into a remarkable human being.  To assist him on his journey, Rocky develops a timid relationship with an equally insecure girl, a pet shop worker named Adrian (played wonderfully by Talia Shire).  To see the two of them together on their first date is one of the film's most entertaining, bittersweet moments; Rocky's small talk is hilarious yet mundane--Adrian looks terrified, yet finally begins to relax, to come out of her shell.  Once two lost souls, Rocky and Adrian become indispensable to one another; their growing love transcends the pending fight--the exciting showdown.The fight itself is cinematic brilliance:  a thrilling, totally believable match that will have the viewer cheering from his chair.  Carl Weathers looks, moves, talks, and fights like an egotistical heavyweight champ, while Burgess Meredith captures one of film's most memorable roles as Mickey, Rocky's gnarled, battle-tested trainer.

134733,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,079283321X,"""flickjunkie""","[4, 4]","Once in a long while, there comes a film that has such tremendous gestalt that it rises above any negative criticism.  `Rocky' is such a film.  It is more than just a story about an underdog boxer who makes the best of a  title shot.  It is a story about perseverance, heart and courage.  Most of  all it is a story about transcendence.  All the major characters in the  film, including Apollo Creed, transcended their previous limitations.  If  you reflect on it, Mick, Paulie, Adrian and Rocky were all changed people  by the end of the film.  Apollo was changed too, but we didn't realize it  until the sequel.The film was also a transcendent event for Stallone,  and served as an allegory of his life.  If there ever was an underdog in  Hollywood, it was Sly Stallone.  His trademark droopy eyes and slurred  speech were the result of a severed nerve at birth, and this disability was  not conducive landing roles as a leading man.  As a child, he was teased  for his slur, and coupled with his name endured a childhood of Tweety bird  jokes.  He knew a little about fighting.  He was expelled from fourteen  schools by the time he was fifteen.  In the film, when Rocky was knocked  down and his corner told him to stay down, it was symbolic of his own life  when his acting teachers at University of Miami tried to dissuade him from  acting.  In both cases he got up and proved them wrong.This film found  its original inspiration in a boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Chuck  Wepner (a.k.a. The Bayonne Bleeder), an astronomical underdog who lasted  fifteen punishing rounds and emerged with his pride and a face that looked  like ground beef.  Anyone who saw that fight and this film would see the  obvious similarities in Ali/Creed and Wepner/Balboa.  After seeing this  fight, Stallone wrote the screenplay in three days.Stallone had several  big money producers interested in the script, but they refused to produce  it with him in the lead.  So he turned them down and produced it on a  shoestring, grossing over $225 million and winning Best Picture and  Director Oscars and acting and writing nominations for Stallone.  Stallone  should have stopped after the first `Rocky' as the sequels did not and  could not compare.  However, I can't blame him for riding the gravy train  after the price he paid for admission.Stallone is brilliant in the role,  as the inspiration came from his own life.  He simultaneously elicits  pathos and respect from the viewer.  Though Balboa is none too bright,  Stallone gives him a pure heart, unswerving desire and through sheer  simplicity makes him the wisest of all the characters in the film.  By the  end, everyone in the theater is pulling for Rocky because to do so is to  cheer for their own lost dreams.  The end is triumphant and I still get a  lump in my throat when he screams out, ""Adrian"".This film is in my top  50 of all time.  I'm partial to underdog stories and this is the  heavyweight champion of that category.  I rated it a perfect 10.  `Rocky'  may not have been great filmmaking but it was great art.

Sylvester Stallone gives a likable performance as the title nobody who defies the odds. Combining the cheering story with some famous sequences and a great theme you get something very memorable. The original film that shot Sylvester Stallone to stardom, Rocky tells the tale of a boxer who receives the chance of a lifetime. Rocky Balboa is a mediocre boxer who has no real chance of becoming anything. However he is spotted by a world champion boxer Apollo Creed who wishes to face Rocky as a publicity stunt. Here Rocky finally has the chance to prove himself and become something. In some iconic scenes he trains in his buddy's meat freezer with the famous theme playing in the background. When the day of the fight comes it is evident that Rocky is no fluke and he may even have a chance to win. What makes this movie so touching is Rocky's humble beginnings and his lovable personality.

As the ultimate underdog story very few films can claim to be its superior.  If you are like me and didn't want to get the whole series and just wanted this film, you now have it in a very nice digibook format which is eco-friendly too as the only plastic here is the disc itself.  The picture quality is much better than the 25th Anniversary Special Edition standard dvd that I have but it is by no means a reference quality blu-ray as the picture quality has some sub-par frames and some obvious DNR work where parts of the frame are not as sharp as the rest of the frame.  The sound quality though is good and again while not reference quality the DTS-HD MA 5.1 surround option is perhaps the best this film has ever sounded on disc to date.  As this disc is obviously taken from the complete box-set you get nada special features which may bother you so be warned!  As for me, I am content as I don't really rate the Rocky sequels as much as I do this the first film of the franchise.  While this is not a reference quality blu-ray by any stretch of the imagination, it is still much better than the standard dvd and the digibook is a nice to have as well despite no special features.Acceptable 1080p visuals, better but not excellent sound quality, no special features but a great story and a nice digibook packaging makes this somewhat of a mixed bag and so is recommended for the not-too-picky collector or the casual fan like myself.

I was born two years after this movie came out, and the theme music and a few well-marketed scenes from the movie were virtually all I knew of it.  I was not prepared for the depth of storyline and character in this film, and remain largely enthralled with the movie.Written by and starring Sylvester Stallone, ""Rocky"" gives the viewer an intimate look at the life of the title character.  Rocky Balboa is a hardscrabble philosopher, an essentially gentle soul who boxes because that is the rugged gift fate gives him.  I absolutely love the detail the film delves into in giving an account of Rocky's life outside of the ring.  The film spends so much time on Rocky and the people in his life, including his girlfriend Adrian(Talia Shire), her brother Paulie(Burt Young), and Mickey(Burgess Meredith), the salty boxing trainer, that the inevitable final fight with Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers) feels somewhat cliched and anticlimactic.  Admittedly, my sense of appreciation for the fight had been severely dulled by decades of spoilery film clips but even aside from that the movie feels more about Rocky's life story and drive than what still feels like an obligatory, tacked-on finale.Despite my last criticism, I love this movie.

And so the emotion made this film deserved the coveted statue as Best Film in 1976.Those were hard times, loaded of profound turbulence and social restlessness; Watergate and Vietnam affairs were still turning around the ethic conscious of many people and Network equaled to add even more combustible to that crackling bonfire.Rocky became in this sense a well calculated picture, that found in sports a true cathartic exit; following perhaps the same aims that Bruce Springsteen achieved with Born in the USA; I mean to bring back the extenuated wills, there were other paths to walk and new motives to get along.So Rocky may be seen as modern fable, an urban legend about an unknown and sane guy who wants to shine and get out from the darkness of the anonymity through the box. This original proposal worked out in harmonic synchronization with a devastated generation for so many problems in the life's ring, who felt the sport in these modern times can become a simple guy into a mythical figure, worldly acclaimed, afr from the madding crowd of so many known nasty subjects around.Rocky meant in this decade the new prototype of the success through unconventional roads, taking into account the huge interest of the entire world by four emblematic box figures: Cassius Clay (Muhammad Ali), Joe Frazier and Ken Norton who defeated him and finally Joe Foreman, a still reminded fight that revived once more the syndrom of David and Goliat.Sylvester Stallone simply found the perfect formula and embodied as simulated boxer and new screenwriter, the great desires to triumph, against all the odds.Maybe the only negative aspect must have been the majuscule personal surprise of Sydney Lumet who gave by discounted he would deserve the coveted Prize that never came to him.",5,The epic in times of crisis!,1157587200,"09 7, 2006",2006,2067,"['Maybe', 'am', 'wrong', 'objectively', 'speaking', 'best', 'film', 'year', 'was', 'Network', 'must', 'know', 'not', 'always', 'best', 'imposes', 'human', 'factor', 'still', 'remember', 'famous', 'statement', 'what', 'fact', 'last', 'instant', 'decision', 'take', 'always', 'emotive', 'so', 'emotion', 'made', 'film', 'deserved', 'coveted', 'statue', 'Best', 'Film', '1976.Those', 'were', 'hard', 'times', 'loaded', 'profound', 'turbulence', 'social', 'restlessness', 'Watergate', 'Vietnam', 'affairs', 'were', 'still', 'turning', 'ethic', 'conscious', 'many', 'people', 'Network', 'equaled', 'add', 'even', 'more', 'combustible', 'crackling', 'bonfire.Rocky', 'became', 'sense', 'well', 'calculated', 'picture', 'found', 'sports', 'true', 'cathartic', 'exit', 'following', 'perhaps', 'same', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'achieved', 'Born', 'USA', 'mean', 'bring', 'back', 'extenuated', 'wills', 'were', 'other', 'paths', 'walk', 'new', 'motives', 'get', 'along.So', 'Rocky', 'may', 'be', 'seen', 'modern', 'fable', 'urban', 'legend', 'unknown', 'sane', 'guy', 'who', 'shine', 'get', 'out', 'darkness', 'anonymity', 'box', 'original', 'proposal', 'worked', 'out', 'harmonic', 'synchronization', 'devastated', 'generation', 'so', 'many', 'problems', 'life', 'ring', 'who', 'felt', 'sport', 'modern', 'times', 'can', 'become', 'simple', 'guy', 'mythical', 'figure', 'worldly', 'acclaimed', 'afr', 'madding', 'crowd', 'so', 'many', 'known', 'nasty', 'subjects', 'around.Rocky', 'meant', 'decade', 'new', 'prototype', 'success', 'unconventional', 'roads', 'taking', 'account', 'huge', 'interest', 'entire', 'world', 'four', 'emblematic', 'box', 'figures', 'Cassius', 'Clay', 'Muhammad', 'Ali', 'Joe', 'Frazier', 'Ken', 'Norton', 'who', 'defeated', 'finally', 'Joe', 'Foreman', 'still', 'reminded', 'fight', 'revived', 'once', 'more', 'syndrom', 'David', 'Goliat.Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'simply', 'found', 'perfect', 'formula', 'embodied', 'simulated', 'boxer', 'new', 'screenwriter', 'great', 'desires', 'triumph', 'odds.Maybe', 'only', 'negative', 'aspect', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'majuscule', 'personal', 'surprise', 'Sydney', 'Lumet', 'who', 'gave', 'discounted', 'would', 'deserve', 'coveted', 'Prize', 'never', 'came']",N/A
134742,AR5SY32T76DBM,079283321X,Hugo D. Hackenbush,"[0, 0]","I'll skip a review of the film, as anyone bothering to read this already knows Rocky is a classic of 1970's cinema, is imminently re-watchable, and a must-own on home video; what you're here for is a review of the latest home video release of Rocky, the 2014 Blu-Ray 4K-remastered edition. So, for those who have double (and triple) dipped on home video, how does it stack up against earlier releases of Rocky?PQ: The new 4K remastering (meaning that this 2014 release is in 1080p, scanned from a 4k source; it is NOT an actual 4K Blu-Ray release); is pretty darn good-looking, overall. It's sharp with good detail and colors are subtle but strong (the red push visible in the 2006 Rocky Blu-Ray is gone). Rocky is a low-budget, gritty, dark-looking film, with much of it taking place either at night or in environments with lots of shadows; blacks are deep and true to the look of the film (if a bit crushing at times). Surprisingly, the average bit rate of the 2014 Rocky Blu-Ray release is totally comparable to the 2006 bare-bones Blu-Ray release, in spite of all the copious extras found on the 2014 disc. In all, this is a decent step-up from the original 2006 Blu-Ray release, and certainly the best Rocky has ever looked on home video. Best of all, the original color scheme is largely left intact; no teal and orange color scheme update for this remaster. Bravo ... at last, 20th Century Fox gets it right! I hope future Blu-Ray catalog releases will follow suit, thus ending this sucky recent trend of altering the original color timing schemes of catalog titles in order to modernize their look.AUDIO: This new version of Rocky sports a 5.1 DTS-HD track that, to my ears, sounds an awful lot like the old 2006 Blu-Ray, which is to say it sounds like a mono audio remixed to give it an artificial-sounding surround effect. It gets the job done, but it doesn't stand out the way the video does, for sure.SPECIAL FEATURES: Back in 2006, Rocky was released both in a fantastic two-disc DVD set with tons of extras, and a bare-bones Blu-Ray release, forcing fans to choose between picking special features or the best A/V available (or, like me, get both releases). In 2009, the same 2006 bare-bones Blu-Ray release of Rocky was included in the ""Rocky: The Undisputed Collection "" box set, and many of the special features from the Rocky 2006 DVD set were included on a separate special features disc; however, missing were the three audio commentaries found on the 2006 DVD set. Rocky was released yet again in 2011 as a Blu-Ray digibook, sporting the same old bare-bones 2006 Blu-Ray. Well, at last, all of the major special features from the 2006 Rocky Two-Disc Special Edition DVD are here in their entirety on the 2014 Blu-Ray release. Congrats, 20th Century Fox/MGM ... it only took you three recycled Blu-Ray releases spread out over seven years! Anyways, if you have already owned the 2006 special edition DVD, you know what to expect here; we're talking about hours and hours of special features ... everything from several documentaries, to the original film trailers, to three audio commentaries; there are even a couple of new (albeit inconsequential) features put together specifically for this release; in all, both fans and casual viewers should find something to enjoy here.So, to sum up, for its current asking price of $13, the 2014 remastered Rocky is the one to pick up if you're in the market for that film alone (e.g., those who may already own the 2009 ""Rocky: Undisputed Collection"", and wish to swap out the older 2006 Rocky Blu-Ray; or those who hate the sequels). That being said, for only $20 here on Amazon.com, you can pick up the 2013 ""Rocky: Heavyweight Collection"" Blu-Ray box set, which has the latest remastered edition of Rocky and the exact same Blu-Ray releases of Rocky II-VI as the 2009 box set (sans trailers for all of the Rocky sequels that were included in the 2009 collection). Either way, fans of Rocky can't lose, IMO.

It starts out with a small time boxer/loan shark hood from Philly with a dead-end career wanting to go out with his friend Paulie's sister Adrian.  The two really hit it off and become close.  Meanwhile, reigning heavyweight champion Apollo Creed is looking for an opponent to fight at the bicentennial since his scheduled challenger was unable to fight.  On a whim he picks a bum fighter from Philladelphia, where the fight is being held because of the 1776 stuff.  That bum is Rocky.  With help from his trainer Mickey and the motivation from Adrian, Rocky proves to be a formidable foe to the champ.  He just barely loses to Creed in an amazinginly realitic fight scene with blood, nasty bruises, and eye closing swells.  Everything sounds real, right down to the punches.  Stallone does a superb job of acting like the dimwitted boxer, especially in the scenes where he is getting beaten up brutally.  Carl Weathers does a good job playing the boastful champ.  Shire really gets into the character and acts like the shy girl waiting to bloom that her character is.  Burgess Meredith can really let his emotions loose as Mickey.  Bill Conti's musical score mixes horns, strings, drums, and contemporary to create a diverse but memorable piece  All in all, this movie has an excellent cast, excellent fight scenes, and a great soundtrack.

Booker,"[2, 3]","Never mind that the director used stock footage to fill-in the arena footage in the fight scenes; never mind that the boxing scenes between Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) and Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers)lacked the pugilistic realism and precision of it's superior descendant Raging Bull--Rocky is still the quintessential sports film about the ultimate underdog overcoming all odds.It's hard to believe that this film's been out 32 years. Rocky is still as palpable as it ever was because it's one of those rare films that speaks directly to the heart--everyone pulls for the underdog. Almost all successful men and women were chosen from birth to be successful. These people are born to the right people and have the right pedigree. These people are born tall, or strong, or beautiful. These people may be born rich, or these people may be born into a stable middle class home. Even if they are born to a single parent, these individuals are born to a single parent who wants the best for them, a parent who'll sacrifice everything to send them to the right schools, a parent who'll scrub floors to send that kid to college. Some people are born and raised by both their parents and their grandparents. Look at Obama. Could he have overcome his racial heritage and his economic disadvantages without the love, guidance, determination, and support of his mother?--I don't think so.Then, there are those of us who aren't so lucky. We're born dirt poor. No one loves us. We aren't tall, strong, smart, or beautiful. We're doomed in the womb. We watch as others leave the neighborhood for colleges. We watch our neighborhoods change around us. A building's torn down; a new building goes up. We carry our dreams in our pockets with the few pennies we are able to earn with our High School diplomas; worse still, we're dropouts and can't find anything at all. We fade like afterthoughts. We become neighborhood faces,like that old busted chair or knicked-up table that never moves no matter what. You could paint the room, change the pictures, change the carpet, or change the sofa, but that old busted chair or knicked up table remains a constant fixture. You say to yourself, ""if only someone, somewhere, gave me a break,"" but all you get is scorn, rejection, and ridicule. There's no excuse for any grown man or woman to fail, they say. Go to work, they say. Why aren't you like such and such, they say. You should be doing this, they say. You should be doing that, they say. You look in the mirror and you see the deepening lines in your face; you look sad--you look away from your reflection. You crawl inside of yourself. You drink,you smoke--you don't care anymore. You're no good to a woman; you're no good to yourself. You're not a man anymore. You resign yourself to your fate: you're a loser. You'll live, you'll die, and that'll be that. So, you go and throw your last pennies and your dreams into a fountain and you make a wish. Then, out of the blue, opportunity takes you by surprise. At first it seems too good to be true. You're afraid that, at any moment, you'll wake up from a cruel shimmering dream. Then, you realize that you are not dreaming, that chance is smiling in your direction.You cry. You thought she'd forgotten you, but she didn't. Chance comes early for some and late for others and when she leaves she's gone forever. So you take your chance, and you make the most of it--you turn your life around and the people cheer you on. You're born again.To me, this is the essence of Rocky, and no actor could have pulled it off like Sylvester Stallone. If you've ever been down or counted out, his realistic and raw portrayal of a down-and-out loan-shark collector will resonate with you. Bill Conti composed the soundtrack to this film. When Rocky's sprinting across the wharf to ""Gonna fly Now"" you want to stand up and cheer him on. My favorite point in the movie is when Rocky goes down in the fourteenth round. Everbody--his trainer(Burgess Meredith)and his cornermen--are screaming and telling him to stay down and take the count-out. But Rocky's been down forever and this time he's fighting for the only chance he's ever had in his whole miserable life. Then, Adrian (Talia Shire) is standing in the back of the arena watching Rock; she's crying. She closes her eyes and says a prayer. Bill Conti's ""Going the Distance"" is soaring as Rocky makes it to his feet. He's bloody and swollen--he can barely see out of his right eye--but he shakes his head and tells the ref that he's ok. Then, with the champ bearing down on him, Rocky sees his opportunity. The champ's hands are high, his bruised right ribs are exposed. Rocky surges up with everything he has and smashes a left uppercut into the champ's ribs. The bell rings, and Rocky survives the round. I don't know if the film would have been as effective without Bill Conti's soundtrack; the soundtrack gave a voice to every scene in the film. Scorceses's Taxi Driver came out the same year as Rocky and many critics and fans feel that Taxi Driver should have won the Oscar instead of Rocky. If you go on the technical merits of both films, Taxi Driver is a superior film to Rocky; however, Taxi Driver does not stir the collective imagination as powerfully as Rocky does. Rocky is both universal and primal: almost everyone's been down at some point in their lives, and almost everyone has a heart--in these respects, Rocky is superior to Taxi Driver. I've seen thousands of great films, from Hitchcock to Bergman, Kurosawa to fellini, Lang to Lean, Kazan to Copolla; Rocky remains my all-time favorite film.Bondage and Discipline, Sadism and

Although the feel-good, come-from-behind story has been done to death, Avildsen's mix of low-life street drama, heart-tugging romance (with Talia Shire as Rocky's faithful girl), and bruising, in-the-ring melodramatics hammer home the uplifting message of hope like few films ever have.

Well, I can say that if you haven't seen it you need to, no matter what type of movies you are into.  The story and characters will pull you right in and you'll be addicted to the film.  Of course, Sylvester Stallone definately gets my pick as best actor in this film as he plays Rocky, the innocent and lovable underdog boxer who is challenged by the world heavyweight champion.  This movie has some of the greatest moments and lines that should stay in everyone's heart and mine until they die.  There's only one thing I can't condone about this DVD:  The special features.  There really isn't anything except the director showing some 8MM footage of fight rehearsals.  What do real fans want?  I would want to see a documentary of each film on each seperate movie disk, but for some reason MGM is reluctant, and they just when through the whole ordeal of having to re-sell a crapload of their titles.

134755,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,079283321X,Joker,"[2, 2]","I remember seeing Rocky (1976) when it came out.  It was a movie that really gave an energy boost to the general public.  People became motivated to get in shape and conquer the world, if you will.  I like the characters and the overall feel of this movie.  It takes place in Philadelphia beginning in November 1975 and ends in 1976.  I like the portrayal of the city life of Philadelphia and how we see Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) emerge from being an underachieving local boxer to fighting for the heavyweight title only months later.  The best part of this movie for me is the fact that the first hour-plus was spent on character development.  During this time we get to know who Rocky Balboa is, his personality, what makes him tick, etc.  The same goes for the other characters - Adrian (Talia Shire), Paulie (Burt Young), Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), Mickey (Burgess Meredith), and so forth.  A lot of young people think this movie is slow moving and are bored to tears.  Well, this movie was from a time when there was such thing as character development.  All the main characters gave great acting performances (four actors were nominated for Academy Awards), but the two best in my opinion were by Sylvester Stallone and Burgess Meredith.  One thing I notice about Adrian in this movie - she goes from being a shy, quiet, somewhat unattractive woman to really opening up and becoming talkative and more attractive all in a short period of time.  I know this had to be done in order to make the audience accept her as Rocky's girlfriend, but still it's something that's very noticeable (I don't mean this in a bad way).The musical score by Bill Conti is one of the strong points of the movie.  The music fits the scenes like a glove (no pun intended) throughout the movie.If you want to see a timeless classic, then see this movie.  It's my favorite out of all six of the Rocky movies.

I am in no wise forgiving Sly for his crucial mishaps in later sequels, but some credit must be given here. This film won Oscars and other film awards on a budget of less than a million dollars and with (considered) b-rate actors. A lot of credit, then, must be given to the actual material. Thank you, Sly.The film starts out well with interesting and suggestive cinematography, with excellent direction in the first fight sequence. You must pay attention to the first five or six sequences, they are masterful in character development and really set the tone for the rest of the movie. This movie does not get past eight stars, however, as it will take more genius than a few memorable moments and good character development to make up for the irreducibly simplistic and underdeveloped plot. A good one, sure, but far too common, even by 1976 standards.This movie was blessed with the presence of great character actors, for without them, I do not think this movie would have succeeded.

He breaks legs for a local bookie on the side.  He trains at a gym, but only does so halfheartedly--to the point where the owner of the gym gives his locker away because of his lack of focus. He has a crush on his best friend's sister, a girl named Adrianne who works at a pet shop. All in all, Rocky is just another guy trying to make it in 1975 Philadelphia.When the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed, has problems finding someone to fight at a holiday spectacle he's planning on New Year's Day, he decides to give a local guy a shot at the title. He chooses Rocky not for his skill, but because he's known as the Italian Stallion. Apollo thinks beating this hometown boy will let people know that he is the American Dream.Rocky is the quintessential American hero.  This is the greatest underdog sports movie and the one that paved the way for all the ones to follow.  This rerelease in a two-disc collector's edition is long overdue.  Some have problems because the film has been released so times, but with Rocky Balboa hitting theaters this winter it was pretty much a given that they would rerelease this film.The extras:About the best thing in this collector's edition (in my opinion) is the inclusion of three sets of audio commentaries.  The one with Sylvester Stallone is, in itself, worth the $20 price tag.  Since Stallone wrote the movie as well as starred in it, he has some interesting perspectives and his reflection on the project 30 years later will be a big draw for longtime fans of the film.  The ""making of"" featurette on the second disc is lengthy, so be prepared for all the info it contains. It comes in three parts and I watched them separately since they contain over an hour's worth of extra info.  Finally, the booklet that comes with this set is an excerpt from an upcoming book called Rocky: The Ultimate Guide.I would definitely recommend this DVD set for fans of the movie, and anyone who loves underdog sports movies.

It is a powerful testament to this movie's strength that here I am, a female and not someone who watches boxing, and I adored the movie. There are just so many layers in here to appreciate.Rocky is a barely-making-it boxer who is struggling to do the best he can. He knows this life is very hard, but he feels he has little other choice. He diligently keeps chasing a woman who works at a local pet shop, even though she barely gives him any encouragement. He sees beyond her plain appearance and shyness and appreciates her love of animals and her gentle nature.Then, fate intervenes. An African-American boxer is in town and no whites will fight him. They all invent excuses. Abusive language is thrown around like ""jig clowns"". It is upsetting to realize that there are people out there who will be so nasty just because of someone's birth skin color. Rocky gets chosen out of a list simply because of his name - ""Italian Stallion"" - to be offered the fight. There is no expectation that this dirt-bottom boxer will even slightly hold his own against the champ.Rocky doesn't even get much time to train. He has to go from his barely-making-it status to being in the center of a publicity whirlstorm. He has doubts. He is realistic. But his girlfriend believes in him, and she herself blossoms and flowers under his gentle care. She was told by life that she had to rely on her brains because she didn't have much of a body. Rocky was told the opposite. It really shows how much people are shaped by the world around them and its negative messages.Even the side characters shine. Rocky tries his best to redirect a young teen girl who is throwing her life away. She's abusive in return. Again we see just how much people get set onto a path and find it hard to escape.I have parakeets and I admit to loving how parakeets are infiltrated into the movie :) The ad-libbing with them is great!Even though I knew how the movie was going to end, I had tears in my eyes.

Yet upon every viewing it is as fresh and alive as the first:  I still get the goosebumps!!!MAN, DO I GET THE GOOSEBUMPS!!!I love the audio commentary!!!  It is the most tight of any DVD I have seen with so many cast and crew taking part.  Each jamming their own p.o.v. into the mix. It never lags for a second.And Stallone - in only a simple face to camera video commentary - takes you thru all the twists and turns, lows and highs that made his debut forever THE DEBUT!!!I feel as if I have seen the movie all over again for the very first time - as a one man show in a mere 1/2 hour!?!Along with Fred Astaire; Sylvestor Stallone is still my favouite actor!!!  I'd watch him in anything - barring 'The Specialist'.Subsequent to this movie Sly could have been so much more; if only he had allowed himself - to once again - to become so much less.A very talented man who puffed  himself up so much he became peceived as less than he truly was.Yet an actor  - who's films in the 1980's reeked of Ameican Plastic - can still inspire and send gooey shivers down another man's spine with just the warmth of his voice, the sensitivity of his arguement and the childlike wonder in his eyes.If actions speak louder than words then this is a very  perceptive, warm, sensitive, mentally articulate human being!!!He is the only actor/person I enjoy despite the obvious false humility and controlled pretention.  He is truly likeable and still overwhelmingly inspiring.  A most under appreciated star, actor, writer, director, editor and all around personality!!!America do not forget Sylvestor Stallone.

134777,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,079283321X,Martin Asiner,"[2, 2]","One of the problems in judging the first in a series of movies is the tendency to rate the original against its sequels.  This problem becomes more acute with ROCKY since each of the sequels becomes progressively derivative and thus less appealing.  The result is that the audience tends to let Rocky's post Apollo Creed bouts impact negatively on the first.  If one can let his reactions become focused only on what a previous generation experienced in 1976, then what becomes apparent is the superb telling of the archetypal tale of the triumph of the underdog.Sylvester Stallone wrote the original script of a down and out club fighter who has the once in a life opportunity to fight for the heavyweight title.  You would think that a nobody like Stallone would have jumped at the chance for Hollywood to even read his script, let alone decide to film it.  But he insisted that he play the lead, and to nobody's surprise but his, the Powers That Be caved in.  It is this real-life triumph over the entrenched screen hierarchy that permeates his film and forms a subtext that allows both Sylvester Stallone and Rocky Balboa to triumph on both levels.The plot is uncomplicated: a Philadelphia nobody gets a chance to fight champ Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), a Cassius Clay clone.  Stallone as Balboa trains hard, undergoes personal crises, and battles Creed in a thrilling but losing effort.  For a movie about boxing, there is surprisingly little of that in it.  The bout with Creed that concludes the film lasts only for five minutes.  The remainder covers growing emotions and expanding expectations, and it is this fascination with the evolution of a clueless and undirected pug to a reasonably polished fighter and human being that has resonated viscerally for two generations of film goers.Balboa is a mid-thirties club fighter from Philadelphia who fights only because his father told him that his lack of brains forced him to rely on his body to make a buck.  Rocky knows how to swat; unfortunately he does not know how to avoid getting swatted.  Still, he is proud of never getting his nose broken.  His won-lost record tilts slightly toward the positive side.  He meets shy Adrian (Talia Shire), who is the sister of his close, if erratic friend Paulie (Burt Young).  Paulie's relation with his sister is totally dysfunctional.  He bullies her, literally throwing her out of their house so she could date Rocky.  Rocky sees all this and recognizes she might be the one.  In one galling Thanksgiving dinner scene, Paulie humiliates Adrian into leaving him and living with Rocky.  Enter Apollo Creed, who needs a local boy to take the place of his injured opponent.  Rocky agrees and trains, punishing his body to take the pounding he knows is coming.  Burgess Meredith is Rocky's manager and his sole cinematic function is to be the bootstrap by which Rocky pulls himself up to be a successful fighter and human being.Much of ROCKY is devoted to a Rocky who has learned that he cannot function as an unconnected man.  He needs the love of a woman to comfort his nights and the wisdom of a manager to shape his body and fight style.  Further, he learns that even a crud of a brother like Paulie can have a soft spot if only one has the patience to slog through a lifetime of Paulie's jealousies and insecurities.  When Rocky gets his head screwed on right, then his manager can focus on the physical aspect of training.  The various scenes of training have since been copied almost to the point of self-caricature in future sequels.  But here, if one can forget those other scenes, then one can appreciate how grueling a regimen an inspired fighter can put his body through if only he has a reason to.  It is not surprising, that we see little of Creed's training sessions since his inspiration comes straight from The Bottom Line.The fight, of course, is the payoff.  It is short, well-filmed, and clearly shows the divergent essences of Creed and Balboa.  Creed is the polished pro, one who relies on his considerable skills and innate assurance.  Balboa is the undisciplined club fighter, one who depends on his swatting power to win.  The conclusion is really one between two polar opposites of living.  Creed lives to fight.  For him, the real payoff is an odd mixture of money plus the joy of flattening an opponent.  Balboa fights to live.  For him, boxing is only a means to ensure the continuity of his new life with Adrian.What stamps ROCKY as unique from its descendants is its insistence that the hero must look inside himself more often then outside himself to continually punish a body to meet increasingly tough opponents.  Merely to morph Creed into Mr. T or Dolph Lundren or Tommy Morrison is not enough to connect an audience to a club fighter that America fell in love with in 1976.",5,ROCKY: Time Enhances its Virtues,1060560000,"08 11, 2003",2003,4811,"['One', 'problems', 'judging', 'first', 'series', 'movies', 'tendency', 'rate', 'original', 'sequels', 'problem', 'more', 'acute', 'ROCKY', 'sequels', 'progressively', 'derivative', 'thus', 'less', 'appealing', 'result', 'audience', 'let', 'Rocky', 'post', 'Apollo', 'Creed', 'impact', 'negatively', 'first', 'one', 'can', 'let', 'reactions', 'become', 'focused', 'only', 'what', 'previous', 'generation', 'experienced', '1976', 'then', 'what', 'apparent', 'superb', 'telling', 'archetypal', 'tale', 'triumph', 'underdog.Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'wrote', 'original', 'script', 'down', 'club', 'fighter', 'who', 'once', 'life', 'opportunity', 'fight', 'heavyweight', 'title', 'would', 'think', 'nobody', 'Stallone', 'would', 'have', 'jumped', 'chance', 'Hollywood', 'even', 'read', 'script', 'let', 'alone', 'decide', 'film', 'insisted', 'play', 'lead', 'nobody', 'surprise', 'Powers', 'Be', 'caved', 'real-life', 'triumph', 'entrenched', 'screen', 'hierarchy', 'film', 'subtext', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'triumph', 'levels.The', 'plot', 'uncomplicated', 'Philadelphia', 'nobody', 'chance', 'fight', 'champ', 'Apollo', 'Creed', 'Carl', 'Weathers', 'Cassius', 'Clay', 'clone', 'Stallone', 'Balboa', 'hard', 'undergoes', 'personal', 'crises', 'battles', 'Creed', 'thrilling', 'losing', 'effort', 'movie', 'boxing', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'bout', 'Creed', 'film', 'only', 'five', 'minutes', 'remainder', 'growing', 'emotions', 'expanding', 'expectations', 'fascination', 'evolution', 'clueless', 'undirected', 'pug', 'reasonably', 'polished', 'fighter', 'human', 'being', 'resonated', 'viscerally', 'two', 'generations', 'film', 'goers.Balboa', 'mid-thirties', 'club', 'fighter', 'Philadelphia', 'who', 'only', 'father', 'told', 'lack', 'brains', 'forced', 'rely', 'body', 'make', 'buck', 'Rocky', 'how', 'swat', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'avoid', 'getting', 'swatted', 'Still', 'proud', 'never', 'getting', 'nose', 'broken', 'won-lost', 'record', 'tilts', 'slightly', 'positive', 'side', 'shy', 'Adrian', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'who', 'sister', 'close', 'erratic', 'friend', 'Paulie', 'Burt', 'Young', 'Paulie', 'relation', 'sister', 'totally', 'dysfunctional', 'literally', 'throwing', 'house', 'could', 'date', 'Rocky', 'Rocky', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'one', 'galling', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'scene', 'Paulie', 'Adrian', 'leaving', 'living', 'Rocky', 'Enter', 'Apollo', 'Creed', 'who', 'local', 'boy', 'take', 'place', 'injured', 'opponent', 'Rocky', 'agrees', 'trains', 'punishing', 'body', 'take', 'pounding', 'coming', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'Rocky', 'manager', 'sole', 'cinematic', 'function', 'be', 'bootstrap', 'Rocky', 'be', 'successful', 'fighter', 'human', 'being.Much', 'ROCKY', 'devoted', 'Rocky', 'who', 'learned', 'can', 'not', 'function', 'unconnected', 'man', 'love', 'woman', 'comfort', 'nights', 'wisdom', 'manager', 'shape', 'body', 'fight', 'style', 'Further', 'even', 'crud', 'brother', 'Paulie', 'can', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'only', 'one', 'patience', 'slog', 'lifetime', 'Paulie', 'jealousies', 'insecurities', 'When', 'Rocky', 'head', 'screwed', 'right', 'then', 'manager', 'can', 'focus', 'physical', 'aspect', 'training', 'various', 'scenes', 'training', 'have', 'been', 'copied', 'almost', 'point', 'self-caricature', 'future', 'sequels', 'here', 'one', 'can', 'forget', 'other', 'scenes', 'then', 'one', 'can', 'appreciate', 'how', 'grueling', 'regimen', 'inspired', 'fighter', 'can', 'put', 'body', 'only', 'reason', 'not', 'surprising', 'see', 'little', 'Creed', 'training', 'sessions', 'inspiration', 'straight', 'Bottom', 'Line.The', 'fight', 'course', 'payoff', 'short', 'well-filmed', 'clearly', 'divergent', 'essences', 'Creed', 'Balboa', 'Creed', 'polished', 'pro', 'one', 'who', 'considerable', 'skills', 'innate', 'assurance', 'Balboa', 'undisciplined', 'club', 'fighter', 'one', 'who', 'swatting', 'power', 'win', 'conclusion', 'really', 'one', 'two', 'polar', 'opposites', 'living', 'Creed', 'fight', 'real', 'payoff', 'odd', 'mixture', 'money', 'joy', 'flattening', 'opponent', 'Balboa', 'fights', 'live', 'boxing', 'only', 'means', 'ensure', 'continuity', 'new', 'life', 'Adrian.What', 'ROCKY', 'unique', 'descendants', 'insistence', 'hero', 'must', 'look', 'more', 'often', 'then', 'outside', 'continually', 'punish', 'body', 'meet', 'increasingly', 'tough', 'opponents', 'Merely', 'morph', 'Creed', 'Mr.', 'T', 'Dolph', 'Lundren', 'Tommy', 'Morrison', 'not', 'enough', 'connect', 'audience', 'club', 'fighter', 'America', 'fell', 'love', '1976']",N/A
134778,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,079283321X,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[1, 2]","It's happening again. I'm watching movies in completely the wrong order. I watched Back To The Future in the wrong order (three, two and then one!), and now I'm watching the Rocky movies in the wrong order. The first one I saw was Rocky Balboa, and then the one with Dolph Lundgren. And now I've seen the first one.In my current workplace, we have these talking keychains, tacky stuff that insist on charging a fortune for, and they feature lines from popular films. We've had Dirty Dancing, Scarface, Star Wars, Rocky and a couple of others. Customers press the buttons (constantly), but the one I seem to constantly hear is ""Yo Adrian! It's me, Rocky!"" So I smiled whenever I heard one of the six lines that features on the keychain.The story's pretty simplistic, but effective, so I won't repeat what millions of other reviewers have said before me. What was astonishing is that it was written by Mr Stallone himself. That I was surprised at. Congratulations to him, he's made a good franchise out of it (except for part five apparently - I originally thought Rocky Balboa was part five!)I really didn't like the cover to this blu ray edition. Yes, we know that Rocky is a movie about boxing, but do we really need to see a bruised and bloodied Stallone on the cover? I said that as soon as I saw the cover, I just don't like it.Apart from all the boxing scenes, there's a genuine love story going on too. I went all gooey when I saw the scenes between Stallone and Talia Shire, who played the afore mentioned Adrian. The scenes where Rocky is trying to get the shy girl to talk to him and trying to impress her, was excellent, and made me really go all soft and gooey inside. And the gradual change in Adrian's character was brilliant too. But she literally does not talk much throughout the movie.Stallone was really good in this. His body is not as pumped up as it is in later movies (obviously before he really got into the whole body building scene), and it looks a lot more natural. More preferable in my opinion. He's still hubba hubba. And the sad puppydog eyes are still there. I always feel shockingly maternal when I watch Stallone movies - I just want to protect him.The blu ray looks fantastic, it's still grainy which gives the film a certain edge, and obviously there's so much that can be done in high definition to a film that's meant to look grainy. Who wants clean and shiny movies all the time? The boxing scenes (choreographed by Stallone himself) are frighteningly realistic, bloody and will make the viewer wince at every hit. The fight scene was filmed in reverse order apparently, starting with the fifteenth round, and lots of makeup, and gradually moving the makeup with each scene until it was back to round one. Rocky actually won an Oscar for film editing because of this.The Rocky movies are always brilliant to watch, and I do really like watching them. Maybe it's something about Sylvester, because the whole boxing thing really does scare me. Yes, lets beat each other to a bloody pulp for money. Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. No thanks. But I'll still watch the movies.",3,"Great film, bad cover",1220918400,"09 9, 2008",2008,3095,"['happening', 'again', ""'m"", 'watching', 'movies', 'completely', 'wrong', 'order', 'watched', 'Back', 'Future', 'wrong', 'order', 'three', 'two', 'then', 'one', 'now', ""'m"", 'watching', 'Rocky', 'movies', 'wrong', 'order', 'first', 'one', 'saw', 'was', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'then', 'one', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'first', 'one.In', 'current', 'workplace', 'have', 'talking', 'keychains', 'tacky', 'stuff', 'insist', 'charging', 'fortune', 'feature', 'lines', 'popular', 'films', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Dirty', 'Dancing', 'Scarface', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Rocky', 'couple', 'others', 'Customers', 'press', 'buttons', 'constantly', 'one', 'seem', 'constantly', 'hear', 'Yo', 'Adrian', 'Rocky', 'smiled', 'whenever', 'heard', 'one', 'six', 'lines', 'keychain.The', 'story', 'pretty', 'simplistic', 'effective', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'what', 'millions', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'What', 'was', 'astonishing', 'was', 'written', 'Mr', 'Stallone', 'was', 'surprised', 'Congratulations', 'made', 'good', 'franchise', 'part', 'five', 'apparently', 'originally', 'thought', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'was', 'part', 'five', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'cover', 'blu', 'ray', 'edition', 'Yes', 'know', 'Rocky', 'movie', 'boxing', 'do', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'bruised', 'bloodied', 'Stallone', 'cover', 'said', 'as', 'soon', 'saw', 'cover', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'it.Apart', 'boxing', 'scenes', 'genuine', 'love', 'story', 'going', 'too', 'went', 'gooey', 'when', 'saw', 'scenes', 'Stallone', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'who', 'played', 'afore', 'mentioned', 'Adrian', 'scenes', 'where', 'Rocky', 'trying', 'get', 'shy', 'girl', 'talk', 'trying', 'impress', 'was', 'excellent', 'made', 'really', 'go', 'soft', 'gooey', 'inside', 'gradual', 'change', 'Adrian', 'character', 'was', 'brilliant', 'too', 'literally', 'not', 'talk', 'much', 'movie.Stallone', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'body', 'not', 'pumped', 'up', 'later', 'movies', 'obviously', 'really', 'got', 'whole', 'body', 'building', 'scene', 'lot', 'more', 'natural', 'More', 'preferable', 'opinion', 'still', 'hubba', 'hubba', 'sad', 'puppydog', 'eyes', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'always', 'feel', 'shockingly', 'maternal', 'when', 'watch', 'Stallone', 'movies', 'just', 'want', 'protect', 'him.The', 'blu', 'ray', 'fantastic', 'still', 'grainy', 'film', 'certain', 'edge', 'obviously', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'high', 'definition', 'film', 'meant', 'look', 'grainy', 'Who', 'clean', 'shiny', 'movies', 'time', 'boxing', 'scenes', 'choreographed', 'Stallone', 'are', 'frighteningly', 'realistic', 'bloody', 'will', 'make', 'viewer', 'wince', 'hit', 'fight', 'scene', 'was', 'filmed', 'reverse', 'order', 'apparently', 'starting', 'fifteenth', 'round', 'lots', 'makeup', 'gradually', 'moving', 'makeup', 'scene', 'was', 'back', 'round', 'one', 'Rocky', 'actually', 'won', 'Oscar', 'film', 'editing', 'this.The', 'Rocky', 'movies', 'are', 'always', 'brilliant', 'watch', 'do', 'really', 'watching', 'Maybe', 'something', 'Sylvester', 'whole', 'boxing', 'thing', 'really', 'scare', 'Yes', 'beat', 'other', 'bloody', 'pulp', 'money', 'Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr', 'thanks', ""'ll"", 'still', 'watch', 'movies']",N/A

134782,A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR,079283321X,"Mike London ""MAC""","[2, 3]","When Stallone wrote ROCKY and released the film in 1976, he could have little idea how this character would catch on with popular imagination, and effectively launching Stallone's career as a movie star.Why ROCKY really succeeds is it takes an Everyman, the Italian Stallion Rocky Balboa, and gives him the chance of a lifetime - to fight the current heavyweight champion of the world Apollo Creed, played by Carl Weathers.Rocky is simply a fighting nobody, living in Philadelphia, trying to scrape his way through life.  He has some low level mob involvement as an enforcer, but he's not happy with this role in life and opts for mercy when dealing with the debtors his boss sends him to collect payment.  He's obviously looking to get out and fights on the side, but fighting is his real passion.Apollo Creed is looking to promote a fight, but the angle he is pursuing is he will fight an unknown, in the spirit of America as the land of opportunity. .  America was celebrating its bicentennial in 1976, and this fight would be part of those bicentennial celebrations.Ultimately Apollo's promoters come up with Rocky Balboa, the Italian Stallion, as much for the name as anything else.  We all know what happens.  Rocky trains, fights Creed, and becomes successful.If that's all there was to ROCKY, it'd be a pretty fun film, but not really Oscar worthy.  Fortunately there is much more to ROCKY than just that rather clich&eacute; sports film storyline.What sets ROCKY apart is the great writing, acting, and production.  Actually, they had to go low budge with this film, and this low budget actually paid off wonderfully.  Stallone manages to capture the life of Rocky so perfectly the film serves as a vital snapshot of what real life is actually like for the vast majority of lower and middle class Americans.  Rocky struggles to get by, has dreams but these are frustrated by his economic situation.  He's looking for the big fighting break.  Unfortunately for a lot of us that big break never comes.While the film is certainly focused on boxing, the actual fight with Apollo is only a small portion of the movie experience.  We follow Rocky on the streets, we get an idea of his everyday life, his trying to romance Adrian (Talia Shire, Francis Ford Coppola's sister and Nicholas Cage's aunt), his oft trying relationship with his future brother-in-law Paulie.  Of course, the movie delves into the relationship between Rocky and his personal trainer, Mickey (played by Burgess Meredith).  Mickey even calls him out, saying he has the potential to be a great fighter but he's not living up to that potential.  It is these subplots that really make ROCKY the rich film that is really is.Another major proponent of ROCKY is how inextricably linked it has become to the city of Philadelphia.  The entire film was shot in Philly, and there are so many different locations and areas that you can't help but smile when watching the movie if you know Philly.  The art museum especially has become very famous for its association with ROCKY, as Rocky runs up and down the steps in training, and when he gets to the top he throws his hands up in the air, with that look of victory in his face.  And who can forget him training in the meat lockers, punching those big hunks of meat?  Unconventional training, but it works.  Great stuff.Then, of course, we have the famous ROCKY theme, that's been used in all the films and is one of the most famous fanfares in movie history.  Whenever I hear that theme I always think of the art museum training sequence.What really makes ROCKY click is you totally identify with Rocky.  He has dreams and aspirations.  He wants to escape his circumstances.  He wants to win the girl and ride off into the sunset, victorious.  Rocky is the perfect embodiment of that great myth called the American Dream.  He starts out as a nobody, works hard with what he has been given, and makes a success out of himself.And Rocky ultimately gets to live that dream.  He makes his life a success, he falls in love with Adrian and eventually marry.  Rocky manages to escape that fate of being ""just another bum in the neighborhood"", and becomes a major icon in film history. He would go on to star in five sequels to this film, each with varying degrees of success, but none of them quite matched the lightening bolt success of the original.While ROCKY is an Oscar-winning film, Stallone would never again regain the critical acclaim he had with this movie.  His career, while far from being unsuccessful, has never matched the success he had with this movie.  People compared him with Marlon Brando because of this movie.  While he has seen been involved in mostly dull action flicks and critically ridiculed projects, he will always have ROCKY.And I don't care who you are.  ROCKY is a tremendous legacy to leave behind.",5,"Stallone's best film, and the best in the Rocky Series",1193270400,"10 25, 2007",2007,4841,"['When', 'Stallone', 'wrote', 'ROCKY', 'released', 'film', '1976', 'could', 'have', 'little', 'idea', 'how', 'character', 'would', 'catch', 'popular', 'imagination', 'effectively', 'launching', 'Stallone', 'career', 'movie', 'star.Why', 'ROCKY', 'really', 'Everyman', 'Italian', 'Stallion', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'chance', 'lifetime', 'fight', 'current', 'heavyweight', 'champion', 'world', 'Apollo', 'Creed', 'played', 'Carl', 'Weathers.Rocky', 'simply', 'fighting', 'nobody', 'living', 'Philadelphia', 'trying', 'scrape', 'way', 'life', 'low', 'level', 'mob', 'involvement', 'enforcer', 'not', 'happy', 'role', 'life', 'opts', 'mercy', 'when', 'dealing', 'debtors', 'boss', 'collect', 'payment', 'obviously', 'looking', 'get', 'out', 'fights', 'side', 'fighting', 'real', 'passion.Apollo', 'Creed', 'looking', 'promote', 'fight', 'angle', 'pursuing', 'will', 'fight', 'unknown', 'spirit', 'America', 'land', 'opportunity', 'America', 'was', 'celebrating', 'bicentennial', '1976', 'fight', 'would', 'be', 'part', 'bicentennial', 'celebrations.Ultimately', 'Apollo', 'promoters', 'come', 'up', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'Italian', 'Stallion', 'much', 'name', 'anything', 'else', 'know', 'what', 'Rocky', 'trains', 'fights', 'Creed', 'successful.If', 'there', 'was', 'ROCKY', ""'d"", 'be', 'pretty', 'fun', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'Fortunately', 'much', 'more', 'ROCKY', 'just', 'rather', 'clich', 'eacute', 'sports', 'film', 'storyline.What', 'ROCKY', 'apart', 'great', 'writing', 'acting', 'production', 'Actually', 'had', 'go', 'low', 'budge', 'film', 'low', 'budget', 'actually', 'paid', 'off', 'wonderfully', 'Stallone', 'capture', 'life', 'Rocky', 'so', 'perfectly', 'film', 'vital', 'snapshot', 'what', 'real', 'life', 'actually', 'vast', 'majority', 'lower', 'middle', 'class', 'Americans', 'Rocky', 'struggles', 'get', 'dreams', 'are', 'frustrated', 'economic', 'situation', 'looking', 'big', 'fighting', 'break', 'Unfortunately', 'lot', 'big', 'break', 'never', 'comes.While', 'film', 'certainly', 'focused', 'boxing', 'actual', 'fight', 'Apollo', 'only', 'small', 'portion', 'movie', 'experience', 'follow', 'Rocky', 'streets', 'get', 'idea', 'everyday', 'life', 'trying', 'romance', 'Adrian', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'sister', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'aunt', 'oft', 'trying', 'relationship', 'future', 'brother-in-law', 'Paulie', 'course', 'movie', 'relationship', 'Rocky', 'personal', 'trainer', 'Mickey', 'played', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'Mickey', 'even', 'out', 'saying', 'potential', 'be', 'great', 'fighter', 'not', 'living', 'up', 'potential', 'subplots', 'really', 'make', 'ROCKY', 'rich', 'film', 'really', 'is.Another', 'major', 'proponent', 'ROCKY', 'how', 'inextricably', 'linked', 'become', 'city', 'Philadelphia', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Philly', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'locations', 'areas', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'smile', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'know', 'Philly', 'art', 'museum', 'especially', 'become', 'very', 'famous', 'association', 'ROCKY', 'Rocky', 'steps', 'training', 'when', 'top', 'hands', 'up', 'air', 'look', 'victory', 'face', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'training', 'meat', 'lockers', 'punching', 'big', 'hunks', 'meat', 'Unconventional', 'training', 'Great', 'stuff.Then', 'course', 'have', 'famous', 'ROCKY', 'theme', 'been', 'used', 'films', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'fanfares', 'movie', 'history', 'Whenever', 'hear', 'theme', 'always', 'think', 'art', 'museum', 'training', 'sequence.What', 'really', 'ROCKY', 'click', 'totally', 'identify', 'Rocky', 'dreams', 'aspirations', 'escape', 'circumstances', 'win', 'girl', 'ride', 'off', 'sunset', 'victorious', 'Rocky', 'perfect', 'embodiment', 'great', 'myth', 'called', 'American', 'Dream', 'out', 'nobody', 'hard', 'what', 'been', 'given', 'success', 'himself.And', 'Rocky', 'ultimately', 'live', 'dream', 'life', 'success', 'love', 'Adrian', 'eventually', 'marry', 'Rocky', 'escape', 'fate', 'being', 'just', 'bum', 'neighborhood', 'major', 'icon', 'film', 'history', 'would', 'go', 'star', 'five', 'sequels', 'film', 'varying', 'degrees', 'success', 'none', 'quite', 'matched', 'lightening', 'bolt', 'success', 'original.While', 'ROCKY', 'Oscar-winning', 'film', 'Stallone', 'would', 'never', 'again', 'regain', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'had', 'movie', 'career', 'far', 'being', 'unsuccessful', 'never', 'matched', 'success', 'had', 'movie', 'People', 'compared', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'movie', 'seen', 'been', 'involved', 'mostly', 'dull', 'action', 'flicks', 'critically', 'ridiculed', 'projects', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'ROCKY.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'who', 'are', 'ROCKY', 'tremendous', 'legacy', 'leave', 'behind']",N/A

134791,ADE852UR9121C,079283321X,perfecto,"[2, 2]","This is the story...a story which everyone loves, a story about heart, willpower and never giving up. I first watched this movie when I was 10. At that time, I thought this was a great movie, but so was Neverending Story and Popeye. But the difference is, I watch this movie today...more than a decade later and I still think it's a great movie, in fact I appreciate it on so many more levels than I did before. Which brings me to my point, this is a timeless classic.When you think about it, the story is quite typical...nothing extraordinary. Rocky Balboa grew up in what seems to be the slums of Philly. He is a club fighter and he collects debt for his boss, Tony Gazzo by whatever means necessary, which of course includes things like breaking bones. Mick, a hardened trainer knows that if Rocky puts his mind to it, he can achieve so much more and is unhappy with what Rocky does for a living. And one day, Rocky gets a chance of lifetime to fight the current Heavyweight Champ, Apollo Creed due to some injury forcing Apollo's initial advessary out of the fight. Apollo views this as a promotional gimmick for him and sees this increasing his popularity. Meanwhile, Rocky falls for Adrienne, a very shy girl who works in the pet store. Their relationship ends up becoming one of the emotional foundations of this movie. What happens next? Watch it to find out, you'll be surprised and might even find yourself wiping a few tears along the way.First of all, few movies touch the heart as this one did. All the actors in the movie are superb and they definitely look and act the part. The difference between this movie and many others is you actually find yourself caring for the characters. You feel what they feel and you are rooting for them. The fact that Sylvester Stallone's life at that time reflects Rocky's makes the movie even more compelling. You can practically see his passion in the film. It's just that instead of boxing, he was trying to make it big in acting, which after this movie...he accomplished. A drive to be better and to be successful is something everyone can relate to, especially if that success comes after much pain and hardwork.Something that other reviewers fail to mention was the music in this movie by Bill Conti. It is one of the most amazing scores ever produced. It fitted perfectly with the movie at all stages. The music is part of what made this movie so memorable.I have enjoyed this movie thoroughly throughout the years and I still do. They did squeeze Rocky for as much money as they can make, and thus resulting in 4 unnecessary sequels.

A two-bit loser boxer gets his chance, against all odds, for fame and fortune by fighting the champion of the world.  The story symbolizes Sylvester Stallone's own rise to fame.  At the time, Mr. Stallone was a basically unknown actor who had done nothing to show he was capable of making such an all-time great film.  Not only did he give the performance of lifetime as Rocky Balboa, he also wrote the screenplay.  He plays Rocky as a likeable slub.  A washed up boxer who earns a living as an enforcer for a loan shark, Rocky isn't all that bright, but he cares.  He loves animals and falls for the douty Adrian who works at the local pet store.  Talia Shire is excellent as the shy and frumpy girl with thick glasses who eventually comes out her shell.  Burt Young is her lush of a brother Paulie who works in a meat locker and is always scheming for a buck.  Rocky gets his chance at a title when the challenger to the champion of the world Apollo Creed goes down with an injury.  As the fight is taking on the first day of America's Bicentennial Year (1976) in Philadelphia, Creed comes up with the idea that since America is the land of opportunity, he is going to give a local, unknown Philadelphia boxer the chance at the title.  He picks Rocky because he loves his nickname The Italian Stallion.  Rocky reluctantly agrees to fight Creed and despite everyone else looking at the fight as a joke, Rocky trains hard just to go the distance.  In one of the more poignant scenes in the movie, Rocky's former trainer Mickey (played with crusty charm by Burgess Meredith), who had give his locker away at the gym because he declared Rocky a bum, comes to Rocky's decrepit apartment begging for forgiveness and chance to train him.  Mr. Stallone and Mr. Meredith play the scene with alternating anger and forgiveness and it is quite powerful.  The fight scene is compelling and the music still sends chills up your spine.  It's difficult keep a dry eye at the end of the fight as Rocky does go the distance.  Rocky defied all odds by becoming a big hit and upsetting such other films like Network, All The President's Men and Taxi Driver to win the 1976 Best Picture Oscar.  The movie even made it's inspiring and thrilling theme song &quot;Gonna Fly Now&quot; a number one hit for it's composer Bill Conti.  Rocky catapulted Mr. Stallone from unknown to superstar and he parlayed the film's success into a wildly successful career (albeit in movies that don't even close to the power and glory of Rocky).",5,Rocky Is The Champ,980985600,"02 1, 2001",2001,2543,"['Rocky', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'story', 'two-bit', 'loser', 'boxer', 'chance', 'odds', 'fame', 'fortune', 'fighting', 'champion', 'world', 'story', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'own', 'rise', 'fame', 'time', 'Mr.', 'Stallone', 'was', 'basically', 'unknown', 'actor', 'who', 'had', 'done', 'nothing', 'show', 'was', 'capable', 'making', 'such', 'all-time', 'great', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'give', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Rocky', 'likeable', 'slub', 'washed', 'up', 'boxer', 'who', 'living', 'enforcer', 'loan', 'shark', 'Rocky', ""n't"", 'bright', 'animals', 'falls', 'douty', 'Adrian', 'who', 'local', 'pet', 'store', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'excellent', 'shy', 'frumpy', 'girl', 'thick', 'glasses', 'who', 'eventually', 'out', 'shell', 'Burt', 'Young', 'lush', 'brother', 'Paulie', 'who', 'meat', 'locker', 'always', 'scheming', 'buck', 'Rocky', 'chance', 'title', 'when', 'challenger', 'champion', 'world', 'Apollo', 'Creed', 'down', 'injury', 'fight', 'taking', 'first', 'day', 'America', 'Bicentennial', 'Year', '1976', 'Philadelphia', 'Creed', 'up', 'idea', 'America', 'land', 'opportunity', 'going', 'give', 'local', 'unknown', 'Philadelphia', 'boxer', 'chance', 'title', 'Rocky', 'nickname', 'Italian', 'Stallion', 'Rocky', 'reluctantly', 'fight', 'Creed', 'everyone', 'else', 'looking', 'fight', 'joke', 'Rocky', 'hard', 'just', 'go', 'distance', 'one', 'more', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Rocky', 'former', 'trainer', 'Mickey', 'played', 'crusty', 'charm', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'who', 'had', 'give', 'locker', 'away', 'gym', 'declared', 'Rocky', 'bum', 'Rocky', 'decrepit', 'apartment', 'begging', 'forgiveness', 'chance', 'train', 'Mr.', 'Stallone', 'Mr.', 'Meredith', 'play', 'scene', 'alternating', 'anger', 'forgiveness', 'quite', 'powerful', 'fight', 'scene', 'compelling', 'music', 'still', 'chills', 'up', 'spine', 'difficult', 'keep', 'dry', 'eye', 'end', 'fight', 'Rocky', 'go', 'distance', 'Rocky', 'defied', 'odds', 'becoming', 'big', 'hit', 'upsetting', 'such', 'other', 'films', 'Network', 'President', 'Men', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'win', '1976', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'movie', 'even', 'made', 'inspiring', 'thrilling', 'theme', 'song', 'quot', 'Gon', 'Fly', 'Now', 'quot', 'number', 'one', 'hit', 'composer', 'Bill', 'Conti', 'Rocky', 'catapulted', 'Mr.', 'Stallone', 'unknown', 'superstar', 'parlayed', 'film', 'success', 'wildly', 'successful', 'career', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'close', 'power', 'glory', 'Rocky']",N/A

The concept of ""Rocky"" was certainly a simple idea; a club fighter going nowhere gets the chance of a lifetime and makes the most of it.  The idea behind the plot is believable and the characters are fairly believable as well.  Sylvester Stallone does a credible job as the unknown boxer.  He is a likeable guy who doesn't take anything too seriously.  Even as a ""muscle"" for the mob, he tries to reason with his ""clients"" rather than do the work he was hired to do.  He has a thing for the sister of his friend and his style of romancing just adds to his audience appeal.  His eventual opponent in the ring, Apollo Creed, is an obvious satire on Muhammed Ali.  His flair vs. Rocky's ""ah shucks"" style also adds to the audience appeal.  Things meander until the fight draws near and Rocky starts to get a better focus on his training.  His workouts and the accompanying music help to get the audience stirred up for the main event.The fight is an interesting event.  Most boxing fans would regonize that the fight would have been ""called"" long before the final round.  We are not made aware, until later Rocky movies, that fighters can actually die in the ring.  However, we know that we are in a modern day fairy tale so why let such minor points distract us.  However, the beatings that each fighter administers on the other may have succeeded too well on the screen.  The excess just got worse in later Rocky films.  The ending of the fight helped, I think, to add to the power of the movie by keeping us focussed on the improbable rather than the impossible.  The music, the calls for Adrian, the rare humility from the champ all create a goose bump of an ending.Rocky is a great film that I have seen many times simply because I always toss away the remote when I come across it on TV.  It stirs something good and positive in all of us.  Everyone of us wants to think we'll rise up to the occassion if lady luck finds us while we're just killing time.

In the subsequent movies Balboa becomes a &quot;great&quot; boxer, and we lose one of the most endearing characters in film history. This egregious example confirms that sequels are self-serving and spoil the imagination of viewers of the orginal work.The main reason that this work is so moving is the character development of the title character. From his inept attempts at loanshark enforcement and romance, to his moments alone in his seedy apartment staring in the mirror, talking to his pets, to the advice given to the young girl, we find this man of violence very appealing.

Instead of using large, complex brushstrokes, it makes a great story out of ordinary people. Sylvester Stallone gives a great performance as Rocky, he's not some brute tough-guy, he's just a nice guy who is suddenly given a big chance at his sport. The screenplay by Stallone is an authentic and intriguing journey into the world of boxing, and the side storylines do not interrupt the film's structure but flow along with it. There is also sweet, uplifting romance with the story of Rocky and Adrian (played by Talia Shire, sister of legendary director Francis Ford Coppola). The boxing scenes are exhilarating and exciting, especially the final boxing climax at the end. Overall, &quot;Rocky&quot; is an inspiring movie because it gives hope that people can get a chance at big things, that we can strive for more, and if we work hard and use our minds, we can excell. &quot;Rocky&quot; seems simple, but has strong things to say at its core.

134808,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,079283321X,Robert Morris,"[0, 0]","In 1976, this film was selected to receive an Academy Award for best picture. (The other nominees were All the President's Men, Bound for Glory, Network, and Taxi Driver.) Then and now, I think that at least two and perhaps three of the other nominees were more deserving. In any event, as we all know, there has since been a series of regressively ineffective sequels to the original. As we await Rocky XX, we can at least appreciate the first. Directed by John Avildsen and starring Sylvester Stallone, it adds to a rather long list of ""Underdog Films,"" a list which now includes Seabiscuit. My rating reflects an opinion of the film as entertainment. It is important to keep in mind that 27 years have passed since its initial release. How difficult it is (at least for me) to judge it on its own terms rather than consider all of the dreadful films (including several Rocky sequels) in which Stallone has since appeared; also to contrast Rocky's non-title fight with those portrayed in Raging Bull.After almost 30 years, I still enjoy seeing Rocky but for different reasons than I once did. One is the use of humor. The first time around, I missed so many comic moments. Another is Rocky's relationship with Mickey (Burgess Meredith). The bond they eventually forge is credible, indeed poignant. And still another is Talia Shire's performance as Adrian. Only an actress of her talent could invest that role with the texture and nuances she does. (I think her talents were essentially wasted in the three Godfather films, especially in Godfather III.) The exteriors in Philadelphia are still effective as is the build-up to the fight during which Rocky and Mickey have  few resources to work with except their imagination and determination. This may not be a great film but it was certainly great fun in 1976 and it still is.

134809,A3VMD1TVFCK9KB,079283321X,Robert P. Bogdanski,"[1, 1]","""Rocky"" is about a man. It is the story of a man who exceeds past all normal expectations and makes the most out of what he is doing. What is he doing? Boxing. Why? As Rocky says in the film, ""You have to be a moron to want to box.""Rocky is played by Sylvester Stallone, whose only other film before ""Rocky"" was ""Weekend at Kitty and Stud's,"" and, as you can probably guess by the title, it was an X-rated movie. But Stallone gives just about the best performance of his career here. Before he started getting into recycled action movies and unfunny comedies, the man had talent, as seen shining through in ""Rocky."" Somewhere along the way he lost that talent, but it's pretty evident that he had it at one time.Stallone wrote the script, which is about a down-on-his-luck Philadelphia man named Rocky Balboa. Rocky is your average tough-guy you see walking down the street, but this film takes a closer look INTO the guy walking past you, and not AT the guy walking past you.He lives in a beat-up, old apartment, infested with roaches, and he barely makes enough money to support himself. His job? Rocky retrieves money for loan sharks. His real job, however, is to break the loaners' thumbs if they don't pay up. He's a muscle man.After he returns from his ""job"" every day, he takes time to do what he has been doing for the past six years, which is boxing. Then, after that, he takes a trip to the local pet store to see the love of his life, Adrian, who works there. He constantly tries to impress her and talk to her, but she is shy and literally does not talk much throughout the entire film.But things change for Rocky after heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) decides that he wants to make a big performance on the 4th of July. He wants to appear nice by letting a regular Joe Schmoe fight him in the ring. All for show, of course. As he is looking through a book of local boxers, he points his finger at the letters THE Italian STALLION, a.k.a. Rocky. He says that fighting an Italian is perfect. ""An Italian found America,"" Creed says. If he fights an Italian-American on the 4th of July, it will be symbolic and will also make Creed look good.But Rocky doesn't realize this is all for show. When he receives word that Apollo Creed wishes to fight him in the ring, Rocky begins to train long and hard with Burgess Meredith, which results in the famous scene where Rocky runs up an entry of stairs in Philly with the music ""Gonna Fly Now"" playing in the background. This scene is spoofed by films world-wide, and it's one of the cornerstones in film history. You will see it all the time. It's just one of those film moments that are marked down in history.The most entertaining thing about ""Rocky"" is how innocent Sylvester Stallone comes across in his role as Rocky. You feel for him when he is trying to impress Adrian and she shrugs him off. The scene where her brother invites Rocky over, and Rocky keeps saying, ""Are you sure she knows I'm coming?"" is a sign of how the guy has been put down. And then when she comes over to his apartment, he acts nice and talks to her. He's not trying any moves on her. He just enjoys being with her. Rocky is a bit of an idiot, as he himself admits, but he's a sweet idiot.And the end, when Rocky fights Apollo Creed, is amazing. A nobody who actually stands a chance against the heavyweight champion of the world. Creed and Rocky are being battered by each other. Creed goes into the opposite corner as Rocky, and one of Creed's managers says, ""This guy thinks this thing is for real -- knock him out!"" You feel sorry for Rocky there, because he is giving the fight all he's got, when it was just a publicity stunt from the beginning, but he didn't even realize it.Things like that are what make ""Rocky"" what it has become over the years. It is a great film, and it has many classic moments that you will see spoofed in films all the time. You should probably see it just for that fact.But the truth is, if you take away all the underlying intricacies, ""Rocky"" is just the story of a simple guy who gets a chance to do something amazing, and he gives it all he's got. I think we've all gone through something like that before, and if so, you will be able to identify with ""Rocky"" all the more.",5,"Cut me, Mick.",1166918400,"12 24, 2006",2006,4259,"['Rocky', 'man', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'normal', 'expectations', 'most', 'what', 'doing', 'What', 'doing', 'Boxing', 'Why', 'Rocky', 'film', 'have', 'be', 'moron', 'want', 'box', 'Rocky', 'played', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'only', 'other', 'film', 'Rocky', 'was', 'Weekend', 'Kitty', 'Stud', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'title', 'was', 'X-rated', 'movie', 'Stallone', 'just', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'here', 'started', 'getting', 'recycled', 'action', 'movies', 'unfunny', 'comedies', 'man', 'had', 'talent', 'seen', 'shining', 'Rocky', 'Somewhere', 'way', 'lost', 'talent', 'pretty', 'evident', 'had', 'one', 'time.Stallone', 'wrote', 'script', 'down-on-his-luck', 'Philadelphia', 'man', 'named', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'Rocky', 'average', 'tough-guy', 'see', 'walking', 'down', 'street', 'film', 'closer', 'look', 'INTO', 'guy', 'walking', 'not', 'AT', 'guy', 'walking', 'past', 'you.He', 'lives', 'beat-up', 'old', 'apartment', 'infested', 'roaches', 'barely', 'enough', 'money', 'support', 'job', 'Rocky', 'money', 'loan', 'sharks', 'real', 'job', 'however', 'break', 'loaners', 'thumbs', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'up', 'muscle', 'man.After', 'job', 'day', 'time', 'do', 'what', 'been', 'doing', 'past', 'six', 'years', 'boxing', 'Then', 'trip', 'local', 'pet', 'store', 'see', 'love', 'life', 'Adrian', 'who', 'there', 'constantly', 'impress', 'talk', 'shy', 'literally', 'not', 'talk', 'much', 'entire', 'film.But', 'things', 'change', 'Rocky', 'heavyweight', 'champion', 'Apollo', 'Creed', 'Carl', 'Weathers', 'make', 'big', 'performance', '4th', 'July', 'appear', 'nice', 'letting', 'regular', 'Joe', 'Schmoe', 'fight', 'ring', 'show', 'course', 'looking', 'book', 'local', 'boxers', 'finger', 'letters', 'THE', 'Italian', 'STALLION', 'a.k.a', 'Rocky', 'fighting', 'Italian', 'perfect', 'Italian', 'found', 'America', 'Creed', 'Italian-American', '4th', 'July', 'will', 'be', 'symbolic', 'will', 'also', 'make', 'Creed', 'look', 'good.But', 'Rocky', ""n't"", 'realize', 'show', 'When', 'word', 'Apollo', 'Creed', 'fight', 'ring', 'Rocky', 'train', 'long', 'hard', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'results', 'famous', 'scene', 'where', 'Rocky', 'up', 'entry', 'stairs', 'Philly', 'music', 'Gon', 'Fly', 'Now', 'playing', 'background', 'scene', 'spoofed', 'films', 'world-wide', 'one', 'cornerstones', 'film', 'history', 'will', 'see', 'time', 'just', 'one', 'film', 'moments', 'are', 'marked', 'down', 'history.The', 'most', 'entertaining', 'thing', 'Rocky', 'how', 'innocent', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'across', 'role', 'Rocky', 'feel', 'when', 'trying', 'impress', 'Adrian', 'shrugs', 'off', 'scene', 'where', 'brother', 'Rocky', 'Rocky', 'saying', 'Are', 'sure', ""'m"", 'coming', 'sign', 'how', 'guy', 'been', 'put', 'down', 'then', 'when', 'apartment', 'nice', 'talks', 'not', 'trying', 'moves', 'just', 'being', 'Rocky', 'bit', 'idiot', 'sweet', 'idiot.And', 'end', 'when', 'Rocky', 'fights', 'Apollo', 'Creed', 'amazing', 'nobody', 'who', 'actually', 'chance', 'heavyweight', 'champion', 'world', 'Creed', 'Rocky', 'are', 'being', 'battered', 'other', 'Creed', 'opposite', 'corner', 'Rocky', 'one', 'Creed', 'managers', 'guy', 'thing', 'real', 'knock', 'out', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Rocky', 'there', 'giving', 'fight', 'got', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'publicity', 'stunt', 'beginning', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'it.Things', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'Rocky', 'what', 'become', 'years', 'great', 'film', 'many', 'classic', 'moments', 'will', 'see', 'spoofed', 'films', 'time', 'should', 'probably', 'see', 'just', 'truth', 'take', 'away', 'underlying', 'intricacies', 'Rocky', 'just', 'story', 'simple', 'guy', 'who', 'chance', 'do', 'something', 'amazing', 'got', 'think', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'something', 'so', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'identify', 'Rocky', 'more']",N/A

He has a crush on a super-introverted pet shop girl, and talks to his turtles and goldfish.And yet, he's a contender for the world heavyweight championship!The film won several Oscars and it's not surprising.  The fast pacing of the film, the long music interlude with its rousing horns and nearly disco back-beat, really struck a chord with audiences in the 1970s.In rewatching Rocky, I noticed a few themes:  the obvious one of a man who is just barely getting by given a chance to make it as a boxing champ.  Another theme is the corporation that is boxing, with Apollo Creed making like it's a show for the audience, complete with red, white & blue underwear and riding in on a float.  Is this the result of a man who wins fights?  Arrogance?  Wow!And then there's the theme of others wanting to take advantage of Rocky's name and see if they can make a buck off of him, specifically his girlfriend's brother, a drunk who is sour and jealous of Rocky's new-found celebrity.  The Christmas scene with the baseball bat is really the only dark part of the film, yet is poignant in its display of drunkenness and jealous rage!And then there's Adrianne.  She comes out of her shell, a shell that's so hard to break through that her own brother thinks she's a loser or that there's something wrong with her.  Rocky's innocence and sympathetic manner pull her through to a dramatic ending at the end of the Creed/Balboa fight that just sends chills.It's a rare film that even with its occasional cheesiness can pull out all the stops, where the acting comes together, the music soars and ... does he go the distance with Creed?

When he comes back to his apartment he tells Adrian that he can't win, but ""no one has ever gone the distance with the champ.

Rocky is one of those timeless movies you will never forget once you see it. Sylvester Stallone did a fabulous job as the screen writer, director, and portraying this legendary character as well. I beleive Rocky will go down in history as the greatest sports movie of all time in anybody's book.Rocky Balboa(Sylvester Stallone) is a young, new, upcoming ameteur boxer in the city of Philadeplhia. After coming off a big fight in his view, Rocky finds himself being pushed away by his local boxing buddies and his trainer, Mickey(Meredith Burgess). After losing his locker at the gym, Rocky takes a break from the boxing scene and focuses more on the local pet store girl Adrianne(Talia Shire).While promoting a big fight in Philadephia, the current world heavyweight boxing champion Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers) is trying to find a new contender for his title. In doing so, he comes across a local ameteur boxer, the Italian Stallion Rocky Balboa.Once Rocky realizes he is the number one contender for the world heavyweight title and believing he has no chance in winnig this fight, he soon begins training. With help from Adrianne, his friend Pauly(Burt Young), and his trainer Mickey, Rocky becomes ready for the biggest fight of his life.Thinking he will just fly by Rocky, Creed treats the whole fight as a joke. Soon finding out that Rocky is for real, Creed realizes that Rocky is no fly by contender and sees that Rocky wants to be world champion. As the fight progresses, Rocky takes it to the world champion round for round and not holding up one bit. After going the distance with the champ, Rocky doesn't find himself holding the world title but something better. His true love, Adrianne.Rocky is a great movie. This movie is great for everybody.

Rocky Balboa is one of the most charming down on his luck loser's the cinema has ever seen. The film sweeps a range of emotions from hope where it was all but gone to chill you to the bone despair. A film of loneliness, surrender and ultimately redemption. Just re-watched the scene where Mickey comes to ask Rocky if he can manage him. The fear in the sub-text and in Rocky's eyes is so tragic and beautiful. I still get caught up in it after dozens of viewings. Just amazing.Movie 5.0 out 5.0 starsBlu-ray detailsThe picture quality is stellar, grainy and wonderful. There are some inconsistencies in the shadows during the fight and of course a large color shift when they cut to stock footage of the audience, but most if not all of these artifacts are probably from the original release. The sound is tinny here and there and over modulates once in a while, again I think this probably due to the original sound track being 30 years old but it is distracting on occasion.The biggest disappointment is the lack of extras. MGM simultaneously released a collector's edition 2 disc DVD of ROCKY with commentary from Stallone and hours of behind the scenes and documentaries on the film. Unfortunately none of these are on the Blu-ray edition. The only extra is the original theatrical trailer. Quite a disappointment and although the picture is great, I would have opted for the DVD if I knew ahead of time. A 30 year old film is technically sub-par to what we see today and seeing it on a DVD vs. a Blu-ray Disc is probably not a hugely dramatic difference. I suggest saving a few bucks and getting a lot more with the 2 Disc DVD.Blu-ray score, due to lack of available extras: 3.0 out of 5.0",4,ROCKY - 1080P glory with none of the extras...,1165536000,"12 8, 2006",2006,1781,"['One', 'only', 'films', 'top', 'ten', 'list', 'get', 'better', 'time', 'see', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'one', 'most', 'charming', 'down', 'luck', 'loser', 'cinema', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'range', 'emotions', 'hope', 'where', 'was', 'gone', 'chill', 'bone', 'despair', 'film', 'loneliness', 'surrender', 'ultimately', 'redemption', 'Just', 're-watched', 'scene', 'where', 'Mickey', 'ask', 'Rocky', 'can', 'manage', 'fear', 'sub-text', 'Rocky', 'eyes', 'so', 'tragic', 'beautiful', 'still', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'dozens', 'viewings', 'Just', 'amazing.Movie', '5.0', '5.0', 'starsBlu-ray', 'detailsThe', 'picture', 'quality', 'stellar', 'grainy', 'wonderful', 'are', 'inconsistencies', 'shadows', 'fight', 'course', 'large', 'color', 'shift', 'when', 'cut', 'stock', 'footage', 'audience', 'most', 'not', 'artifacts', 'are', 'probably', 'original', 'release', 'sound', 'tinny', 'here', 'there', 'modulates', 'once', 'while', 'again', 'think', 'probably', 'due', 'original', 'sound', 'track', 'being', '30', 'years', 'old', 'distracting', 'occasion.The', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'lack', 'extras', 'MGM', 'simultaneously', 'released', 'collector', 'edition', '2', 'disc', 'DVD', 'ROCKY', 'commentary', 'Stallone', 'hours', 'scenes', 'documentaries', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'none', 'are', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'only', 'extra', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'disappointment', 'picture', 'great', 'would', 'have', 'opted', 'DVD', 'knew', 'ahead', 'time', '30', 'year', 'old', 'film', 'technically', 'sub-par', 'what', 'see', 'today', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'Disc', 'probably', 'not', 'hugely', 'dramatic', 'difference', 'suggest', 'saving', 'few', 'bucks', 'getting', 'lot', 'more', '2', 'Disc', 'DVD.Blu-ray', 'score', 'due', 'lack', 'available', 'extras', '3.0', '5.0']",N/A
134817,A2UGVZFKH8O5X4,079283321X,Sean Parauka,"[6, 6]","This Oscar-Winning movie of 1976, ""Rocky"" is by far one of the greatest movies ever made to date. Sylvester Stallone made his acting debut in 1976 when he wrote the story of Rocky Balboa, an underdog Philadelphia club fighter with a heart of gold who has very little money, works for a mobster loanshark and falls in love with a shy girl named Adrian.This movie has a tremendous plot, wonderful character development and a very strong sense of power and novelty.The movie takes place in the fighting city of Philadelphia and here we meet Rocky Balboa in a club fight against a bum, Spider Rico. We see Rocky's everyday life in this movie. Rocky goes home to his pigsty apartment to two turtles named Cuff and Link and a Goldfish named Mobey Dick. Rocky romances and flirts with a shy, lonely and ignored pet shoped employee named Adrian (great job by Talia Shire). Rocky tries to open her up by telling her bad jokes, and tries to ask her out. Then Rocky goes to work as a muscle-man collector for a his loanshark boss, Tony Gazzo. Then Rocky goes to work out at his boxing gym across the street from Adrian, called Mickey's Gym. The owner of the gym is Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith) who knows that Rocky has the heart and talent to become a good fighter. Then after workout, Rocky goes to the neighborhood bar and has a few beers with his Paulie (Burt Young), Adrian's rude and inconsiderate brother.Everything is the same in Rocky's life and nothing changes. Rocky continues to fight bums and doesn't get anywhere. Then one day, a shot of freak-luck changes his life forever. Rocky is given a shot at the World Heavyweight Title by the Champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) on New Years Eve at the Philadelpia Spectrum. Apollo decided to give a local Philadelphia underdog fighter a shot at the title and he picked Rocky. Reluctant at first, Rocky doesn't want to fight Apollo because he is convinced that he is nowhere near as good as Apollo. The promoter of the fight tests Rocky's patriotism and cons Rocky into accepting the challenge. Now with the help of Mickey, Rocky begins to train for a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Rocky's goal is to do what no fighter has ever done before: Go the distance with Apollo Creed.Now with Mickey as his expert trainer, Paulie and Adrian, his new girlfriend by his side in support of him, Rocky is ready to fight the greatest fighter of the world. This movie is the story of the American dream: From rags to riches.This movie is timeless, it's a masterpiece and is one of the greatest films of all time. Sylvester Stallone not only made his debut as an actor here but also did a phenomenal job writing this movie. It's a wondeful movie all the way for anyone to enjoy. The DVD features Audio Commentary throughout the movie from the cast and crew such as: Carl Weathers, Talia Shire, Burt Young, and Director John G. Avildsen. This DVD has tons of special features such as: Theatrical Trailers from all 5 ""Rocky"" movies, Tribute to Burgess Meredith, Sylvester Stallone commentary and many, many more.

This movie is the reason why Sylvester Stallone has been one of my all time favorite actors, despite his bad films! Stallone invented the story and wrote the screenplay for Rocky, making him a Hollywood genius.Everything about Rocky is outstanding. The directing, acting, and even the musical score by Bill Conti.It's a beautiful triumphant tale of a nobody who gets a shot at being a somebody. Our striving nobody, Rocky, is a club fighter who gets a lucky shot at the boxing championship title against the Muhammed Ali clone Apollo Creed, played by football player turned actor Carl Weathers. Then, there's another down on his luck character, Mickey, an old timer who never reached the big time and now can achieve his lifetime dream by training Rocky. This character Mickey, played by Burgess Meredith, is probably one of the most memorable personalities from Rocky. The movie's director, John G. Avildsen would later get inspirations from this secondary memorable character with Mr. Miyagi, and the movie as a whole with 1984's The Karate Kid. And behind the blood and guts of our main character is a wonderful and sensitive heart. The movie doesn't focus much on the fighting. In fact, the movie is all about Rocky's love to Adrian, played by Francis Ford Coppola's real life sister Talia Shire. And when Rocky goes the distance with the champion of the world in the most thrilling and astounding boxing scene in motion picture history, and loses due to the judges' votes, Rocky doesn't mind. He just stands there screaming out ""Adrian!"" to the reporters, and the whole world.On top of the strong drama, is the engaging music of Bill Conti, including the classic training song Gonna Fly Now!Rocky is definitely a movie for all ages and for all times.By far, the greatest movie experience.A+",5,"""You're gonna eat lightnin' and you're gonna crap thunder!""",1103760000,"12 23, 2004",2004,1848,"['Rocky', '1976', 'time', 'number', 'one', 'favorite', 'movie', 'movie', 'reason', 'why', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'been', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'actors', 'bad', 'films', 'Stallone', 'invented', 'story', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Rocky', 'making', 'Hollywood', 'genius.Everything', 'Rocky', 'outstanding', 'directing', 'acting', 'even', 'musical', 'score', 'Bill', 'Conti.It', 'beautiful', 'triumphant', 'tale', 'nobody', 'who', 'shot', 'being', 'somebody', 'striving', 'nobody', 'Rocky', 'club', 'fighter', 'who', 'lucky', 'shot', 'boxing', 'championship', 'title', 'Muhammed', 'Ali', 'clone', 'Apollo', 'Creed', 'played', 'football', 'player', 'turned', 'actor', 'Carl', 'Weathers', 'Then', 'down', 'luck', 'character', 'Mickey', 'old', 'timer', 'who', 'never', 'reached', 'big', 'time', 'now', 'can', 'achieve', 'lifetime', 'dream', 'training', 'Rocky', 'character', 'Mickey', 'played', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'personalities', 'Rocky', 'movie', 'director', 'John', 'G.', 'Avildsen', 'would', 'later', 'get', 'inspirations', 'secondary', 'memorable', 'character', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'movie', 'whole', '1984', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'blood', 'guts', 'main', 'character', 'wonderful', 'sensitive', 'heart', 'movie', ""n't"", 'focus', 'much', 'fighting', 'fact', 'movie', 'Rocky', 'love', 'Adrian', 'played', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'real', 'life', 'sister', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'when', 'Rocky', 'distance', 'champion', 'world', 'most', 'thrilling', 'astounding', 'boxing', 'scene', 'motion', 'picture', 'history', 'due', 'judges', 'votes', 'Rocky', ""n't"", 'mind', 'just', 'there', 'screaming', 'out', 'Adrian', 'reporters', 'whole', 'world.On', 'top', 'strong', 'drama', 'engaging', 'music', 'Bill', 'Conti', 'including', 'classic', 'training', 'song', 'Gon', 'Fly', 'Now', 'Rocky', 'definitely', 'movie', 'ages', 'times.By', 'far', 'greatest', 'movie', 'experience.A+']",N/A

Wow!!The opening fight takes place under the eyes of Jesus, the story unfolds slowly and we get a sense of what kind of guy Stallone's Rocky is - somber, not so smart, with a heart of gold. He's also hard to understand, and a lot of the films dialogue is buried in murk - we only really get to understand what anyone's saying when Apollo Creed comes into the picture, with his ""be a thinker, not a stinker"" appeal to kids to put their energy into study and not sports (and Creed himself seems to be a bit of an academic/bookworm - we see him reading, we never see him training... quite the opposite to Rocky himself). One significant scene shows a Creed associate watching a TV interview of Ricky slugging the beef, a look of concern crossing his face; he calls Creed to come over and have a look, but Creed's not interested - he thinks the fight with Rocky is going to be a walk in the park and he's more interested in business matters - a near-fatal, arrogant mistake. There's also no big music until 80 minutes into this 120 minute movie, and that's when we hear first a big 70s funk them, and finally the gigantic themes that we have for so many decades associated with triumph - THE ROCKY THEME!!! Love it all.The movie is full of great dialogue:Marie: ""Hey Rocky - screw you, creep-o.""Apollo Creed: ""Apollo Creed versus the eye-talian stallion. Sounds like a goddamn monster movie.""Adrienne: ""Hey, it's Thanksgiving.""Rocky: ""To you. But to me it's Thursday.""Mickey: ""Like the Bible says, you ain't gonna get a second shot.""Mickey: ""Women weaken legs.""Mickey (to Rocky): ""Eat lightning and crap thunder.""Great famous scenes, like when Rocky puts the five raw eggs into the big cup and drinks them right down - gulp! The running and training scenes and the big triumphant climb up the steps. Rocky's entire courtship of Adrienne, and the turkey-out-the-window deed that moves it forward. Mickey confronting Rocky in his apartment, talking about the 1923 fight with passion and despair, Rocky's rage to the empty room and his reconciliation with Mickey. Pauly's rage at Adrian, Adrian's rage at Pauly. Apollo Creed giving his energy to the crowd with his showmanship while Rocky watches, bemused and a bit disgusted. Creed's muscles are amazing and compact - Carl Weathers in his prime!! The fight is only 10 minutes at the end of the movie, and is supposed to cover a full 15 rounds, but what insanity, what madness, especially that first devastating punch, the punishment, the lancing of the bloated eyebrow, and the ultimate finale, with the ""ADRIAN!!!! ADRIAN!!!!"" Wow... what a movie!!!This edition comes with plenty of extras:- a commentary track (which my system played through the sub-woofer, which meant I couldn't understand anything). There was a cool 12-minute video collection of 8mm films made by director John Avildsen that shows Stallone training with Carl Weathers, silently. Interesting test case, and Avildsen talks about using the 8mm to experiment and save the actors embarrassment, a blueprint, a sketchpad, try out lenses, angles, lighting, and to show Sly how heavy he was. There was a lot of rehearsal time for the fight scenes. They learned from a fighting script that Sly wrote out for them, had six weeks of prep, the entire film had a short schedule and budget of $900,000. Wanted a soundtrack like Beethoven's 6th, which they'd play during the 8mm screenings. The 8mm clips showed a body guide, they did all the cringing early so that there'd be no cringing when the dailies came in. Sly and Carl Weathers are shown with their swollen-face make-up.- an 8-minute tribute to Burgess Meredith, which talks about how he had been making films since the 1930s, and his performance exceeded all of Sly's expectations, with a great voice. Burt Young reminisced how they got nominated together. Carl Weathers describes the meeting in Rocky's apartment. Lee Grant went out with Meredith to an Indian guru show, talks about their escape speeding down the highway (not sure why this is included). Burgess Meredith, 1907-1007. Only Sly's face is seen, all others are off-screen narrating.- tribute to James Crabe for 3 minutes, mainly the director talking about his talents as a cinematographer on their 12 movies together, starting (ironically) with Save The Tiger. Opening scene in grim club shows Jimmy's genius - shades and darkness. Always finding solutions to tricky camera problems. Was nominated for his work in The Formula, not Rocky. 1931-1989.- a teaser trailer and trailers for Rocky I, Rocky II, Rocky III, Rocky IV and Rocky V. Great! Cheezy announcing like ""You can compare him to Nicholson, DeNiro and Brando. But he is Rocky!!"" ""His name is Sylvester Stallone, but you will always remember him as Rocky!""- three original TV spots, two of 30 seconds, one of 60 seconds- a commentary of 28 minutes with Sylvester, recounting how he went to Hollywood and was trying to make it, rented a small room, from which he could open the window and close the door without leaving his bed. Wrote and wrote. Was with Butkus his dog. Saw Muhammad Ali fight Chuck Wepner, the Bayonne Bleeder, who knocked Ali down. This put him into a writing frenzy, and three days later he had a script, 10% of which remained after the rewrites produced the final script. The original screenplay was very dark, with an anti-hero who throws the fight, Mickey is angry and racist. Rocky doesn't want to be part of that world any more. Too angry and unrepentant. Stallone got a break at a casting call when he mentioned he's a writer. ""Come back later."" The studio liked the script, but didn't want Stallone in it - Ryan O'Neill, maybe, or Burt Reynolds. ""My $40 car had just blown up, so I was taking the bus to work."" Lots of injuries during the production, knuckles flattened out punching beef - beef is hard! Stallone's dad is bell ringer, brother doo-wop singer. Talia Shire was one of the last choices for Adrian. Sly describes characters and motivations to the film, back stories. They had wanted to use Ken Norton for the Apollo Creed role, but lucked out with Carl Weathers. ""Mr Avildsen, I could do better if I had a real actor reading with me,"" he said. ""Carl, that's Rocky, the writer and star."" ""Well, maybe he'll get better."" Nice - that's the attitude we want for this movie! Stallone talks about his dog Butkus' ""train flatulence."" Recounts the original ending for Rocky, where he's looking for Adrian finds her backstage, gives her a light hug, picks up a flag, they fade into the distance. Describes the process of deciding the final freeze frame.",5,the best!,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,6743,"['finally', 'showed', 'Zen', 'Rocky', 'first', 'time', 'Naoko', 'was', ""n't"", 'first',

It's because we all love the underdog story, and a movie like this doesn't need CGI to make it work. This movie's appeal comes from the rawness of Rocky's character and the whole Philadelphia street thing. The actors in this movie turned out to be the right choices, especially Burt Young, Carl Weathers and Talia Shire. There's a lot of realness to this movie that appeals to the viewer who may not have ever seen the movie before, and is just now seeing it for the first time. From a new viewer's perspective, I'm sure that the lack of technology during that time period and the less than fancy production would be refreshing. I love this movie, and it never gets old.

Whether you're into great acting , interesting characters , love stories , or just a plain old a.. whupp'in film , this is your class A ticket to ride. People have said that Rocky's sequels don't measure up to the first one , and I think it depends on your prospective. I will say, that the first one ( Rocky ), wasn't written for a sequel. Sylvester Stallone , got inspired to write a story and he took his time , writing it. Therefore , the story line and charater building was one of the script's, most important aspects and it created a buildup to the eventual fight , that's unforgettable and you'll find yourself holding onto the edge of your seat and swinging your fists in the air.

The people that are in Rocky's neighborhood use broken english just like Rocky.  This dialogue is very realistic to our day.  The training scenes are cool especially when Rocky his hiting the raw meat.  The last fight against Apollo Creed is medium drama like when Rocky scores the first ever knockdown of champion Apollo Creed.  Rocky sure had some troubles on him before he became the famous boxer.  I remember when Rocky takes a beating during the opening scene and wins a wimpy fourty-three dollars.  the mob boss he works for is always treating Rocky like he is stupid or something.  Rocky also loses his locker which really ticks him off because he had had that locker for like seven years and Mickey gave it to another new boxer.  Rocky did some great things when he was not in the ring though.  He helped kids that lived around him like that girl that was smoking at night with a bunch of guys and Rocky knew that she had to be at home so he took her home and told her to stop smoking and using profanity.  He also liked pets because he would always go into the pet store where his future wife was.  I am glad this got best picture because it deserved it big time.

134829,A2EI5WXPCNAB71,079283321X,Tristan,"[1, 1]","This is the great story of the lovable underdog successfully pursuing his dream.  It is both one of the best boxing movies ever and truly a classic movie, winning an Oscar for Best Picture.  I loved watching Rocky exert himself for his goal, and the climactic battle keeps you completely entranced in the movie.  You have to root for the underdog and support Rocky through his troubles.  The musical montage was one of my favorite scenes, as well as the last battle.  What I didn't like about the movie, however, is the love story on the side between him and Adrian.  I guess I would just rather watch Rocky beat the hell out of a slab of meat or do exercises I didn't even know were physically possible than watch him take Adrian ice-skating.

Wu,"[0, 0]","I came into this movie expecting a typical, narrow, but well-told story of one man's training and his battle against all odds to triumph in boxing, as it is advertised. However, I was surprised that 85% of this movie focuses on the human story, not a story of trying to be the best boxer. Instead it is a story of people, and how they deal with their problems, and how they try to change. This only makes the ending far more meaningful.So it all builds up the same theme, but much more effectively than relying purely on shallow feel-goodism. At the same time, I've never seen a film that has focused so well around the theme of struggle, and striving to achieve one's goals against all odds.

134831,A889IJE98KD3Y,079283321X,Veedo 182,"[2, 2]","My review once again is not to rehash the story, for we all know it's one of the greatest underdog stories of our time, and you wouldn't be reading this unless you were familiar with it.  The funny thing is a movie like this would never be a hit now, for there was too little violence, and it was mostly about one man overcoming several obstacles to get a shot at being respectable.  Stallone plays this to perfection, with him experiencing this in his own professional career as an actor, and he gives a realism that can only come from life experience.  This is why Stallone can't recapture this moment because once you've been to the mountain its a harder act to pretend to be hungry enough to climb back, (Although Rocky 2 was decent).  The thing that makes the story so strong was its supporting cast, and the movie world recognized this for they have reused these characters in many different venues to support their hero in whatever genre they were placed.My review is for the blu ray book version that was released to say that it is worth the money for the collectible end of it, the overview by Richard Tanne was good, as well as the Final Fight essay in the back, plus the pictures were good.  As far as the picture itself, I agree with previous reviewers of the blu ray version, its a bit grainy at times, and the stock footage appears phony when you see it, but this is all limitations of the era of when this film was made and the film they used.  As for the sound being tinny at times, and I'm not sure but I was told that at the time this was made they produced the sound the same way they did tv, with a mono setting so it would sound flat in our home theatre setting.  If anyone knows about the sound I would be interested to know if that was true, cause I was always told that they did this, because in the seventies very few of the movie theaters weren't set up for stereo.

134832,A3N110LGDXE6FH,079283321X,Veronica,"[0, 0]","Rocky is a brilliant, wonderful and inspiring film.  I have never written a film review on Amazon before, but I just had to write one in this case.  As a young woman, I didn't think I was going to like Rocky.  As a general rule I hate boxing and turn away from violence on TV.  Yet Rocky was nothing like I thought it would be; it was no brutish, gratuitous celebration of violence but a tender, passionate, exciting tribute to following your dreams and your heart.Everyone knows the outline of the plot by now.  Suffice to say that Rocky is a down-on-his luck fighter living in a squalid flat and feeling as if his life is wasted.  By pure luck he gets the chance to fight for the most coveted price in the boxing world.  He knows he can't win against his opponent, but he does know that if he digs deep and `goes the distance' in the fight then he will redeem himself once and for all.The characters in this movie are fantastic.  It would have been easy for the character of Rocky to have be written as a cocky idiot, the kind of boxer who is all swagger and arrogance - and yet Rocky is nothing like this.  He talks aloud to his pets and is infatuated with a shy pet shop sales assistant (instead of the flashy, smart-talking blond that normally plays the love interest in this type of film).  Rocky doesn't even have the necessary cruelty in him to break a man's finger in his job as a debt-collector.  He does the most romantic things - such as shouting out `hi' to his girlfriend, Adrian, when he is interviewed on the news and shouting out her name repeatedly at the end of the fight scene.Adrian could have been pigeonholed as the `girlfriend' with nothing more to do than slap Rocky on the back and cheer from the sidelines and yet her character brings so much more to the film.  As she and Rocky fall in love the movie blossoms into one of the most romantic I have ever seen.  In the scene at the ice rink and then when they are walking home you realise that they are absolutely perfect for one another (one has the body, the other the mind).  Afterwards, in Rocky's flat, the scene when they kiss is simply beautiful.Overall the film Rocky has everything.  It has edge-of-the-seat fight scenes, romance and passion, truly deep characters and an ending so touching you want to step into the film and become part of it.  I would recommend this film to everyone, especially women who thought in the past that it would be too violent or too unemotional for them.

134833,A16BUYFD7R4QMI,079283321X,"Vincent Tesi ""Vinny""","[5, 5]","...Rocky won best picture at the 1976 Academy Awards anddeservedly so.  The film is a study of a lonely man trapped in anunforgiven city who doesn't pretend who he is not.  The film is brilliantly directed by John Avildsen and backed by an emotionally charged soundtrack written by Bill Conti.  Rocky is an inspiring film rooted in one man's goals and limitations.  Balboa's character traits dominate the film.  We are uninterested if he has any siblings, parents, or friends; the focus is on Balboa's struggle for acceptance and identity within society.  The fight premise is based on former heavyweight unknown Chuck Wepner (The Bayonne Bleeder) and his bout with then heavyweight champ Muhammed Ali.  The Ali- Wepner bout lasted a suprising 15 rounds, highlighted by Wepner's dramatic knockdown of Ali in the 8th round.  Ali rose and went on to win via a decision as did Apollo Creed, but in both instances the decisions were anti-climatic.  Unknown white heavyweights are not supposed to last 15 rounds against the greatest heavyweight champs real or imagined. Rocky's struggle to reveal Adrian's fear of living brings about his own insecurities and failures.  When Balboa gets his title shot he knows that he cannot win, but reconciles that his mere courage and manhood will transcend the outcome of the fight.  The film contains poignant and introspective scenes that open up Balboa's screen presence without annoying voice-overs or histrionic flashbacks. When Balboa picks up a picture of himself as a boy, we need not know about boyhood stories, the story is parlayed in Rocky's adult face.The scene where the cantankerous Micky humbly comes to Rocky's apartment asking for redemption is emotionally draining.  When Balboa explodes and Micky exits, we have an inclination of what might happen next. The brief reconciliation between the thick necked loser and father time is shot from a distance without any audible dialogue.  This distant shot on a cold, dark, Philadelphia street needs no dialogue; it is one of the most engrossing frames in the film. Even the turtle pets in Balboa's apartment reveal his hardened surface and nonthreatening underside. Balboa may look intimidating as a collector with his black leather coat, black hat, and black cut out gloves; but his reluctance to break an overdue bettor's thumb reveals more about the man than his attire.  Balboa's revelations with Paulie, Adrian, Gazzo, and Micky are the essence of the movie.  The fight between Rocky Balboa and Apollo Creed serves as the canvas for Rocky's emotional, physical, and psychological emergence.  I had the pleasure of meeting Chuck Wepner some years ago, he is a successful liquor salesman.  Why couldn't Rocky Balboa be as lucky?

If you love this movie as much as I do, then you'll find that all of the extras on this particular editon are definitely worth the upgrade.  There's well over two hours of behind-the-scenes information on Disc 2, along with the special tribute to the late Burgess Meredith, who played Mickey.  As one of the other reviewers also mentioned there's a special feature about the director of photography, Garrett Brown, and his invention of the steadicam, which enables a cameraman to use a hand-held camera to film with, but without the jerky movements that usually accompanies it on a moving shot.  In the feature, Garrett films his wife running down the famous outside steps of the Philidephia Museum of Art.  He runs alongside of her with his steadicam.  Once they get down to the bottom (and he's out of breath from this), she immediately turns around and runs back up the steps.  He decides to follow her back up, but this time his camera is more focused on her bottom than anything else.  That was funny.  Also, it was that particular footage of the Art Museum's steps that caused the director of Rocky, John Avildsen, to put in the scene of Rocky running up the steps to the top and then jumping up and down with his arms straight up in the sign of victory before the big fight with Apollo Creed.  The special Easter Egg of Sly talking to his fictional character, Rocky, is from the 2001 DVD that came out with all the movies in a boxed set, but it's still wonderful to watch.  You tend to forget that it's actually one person and get emotionally caught up in the dialogue between the two men as they thank each other for the success that was brought to them.  Both Sly and Rocky make funny comments about the other's height, each thinking that the other person was taller than he actually is.  In real life, Sly's only about 5'6"", but he does look taller in all of his movies.  Also, Rocky calls him Rambo just before Sly gives him the Oscar statue that he won for Best Picture of 1976.  Last, but not least, a free ticket to see Rocky Balboa was included, which saved me eight dollars when I went to see it on Christmas Eve day.  So this special edition ended up costing me on $12.00, rather than twenty.  The ticket expires on January 31st, so there's still time to use it if you can find Rocky Balboa playing somewhere.  This is certainly a ""must-have"" for any serious collector of DVDs, not to mention fans of the movie.  I, for one, don't like double-dipping by the movie studios, but when a ton of extras are included on a new edition, I simply have to go for it.  This is the ultimate edition of Rocky, and I think it was made especially for the fans.  I hope the studio does the same kind of treatment with Rocky Balboa when it comes out on DVD in a few months.

More of a cliche, except by those who remember its purity and substance when it was first released.Rocky is a down and out boxer from the poor streets of Philadelphia who falls in love with a local girl, and by sheer happenstance finds himself in the fight of his life against the reigning boxing champion of the world. Seems like such a simple premise, yet so much was happening between all it's characters, that the film never got dull or over the top.Stallone out did himself and surprised everyone when he delivered this outstanding performance. How could you not root for this guy and feel his despair, pain and dreams as his life was happening.His supporting cast was nothing short of excellent. A great mix of very different characters. A drunk, loud, jealous brother. An extremely shy woman, with a heart of gold underneath all her insecurities. An over the top glory hungry boxing champ. An old disgruntled trainer with dreams of managing a champ.I don't think people appreciate the very real fact that it took Stallone a few days to write this script or how he had to fight the studios to let him play the lead. How different this film would have turned out if the studios first choice, Ryan O'Neal, played the lead role.Will Stallone ever play a finer role than he did in the original Rocky? Probably not. He was ""Rocky"" in every way possible, and it was amazing for him to have let the viewers experience that for ourselves.",4,Stallone's best work and an excellent film...,1008028800,"12 11, 2001",2001,1669,"['do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'Rocky', 'as', 'appreciated', 'todays', 'society', 'deserved', 'be', 'amazing', 'film', 'fine', 'story', 'amazing', 'characters', 'film', 'series', 'become', 'somewhat', 'punchline', 'years', 'went', 'More', 'cliche', 'who', 'remember', 'purity', 'substance', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released.Rocky', 'down', 'boxer', 'poor', 'streets', 'Philadelphia', 'who', 'love', 'local', 'girl', 'sheer', 'happenstance', 'fight', 'life', 'reigning', 'boxing', 'champion', 'world', 'simple', 'premise', 'yet', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'happening', 'characters', 'film', 'never', 'got', 'dull', 'top.Stallone', 'out', 'did', 'surprised', 'everyone', 'when', 'delivered', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'How', 'could', 'not', 'root', 'guy', 'feel', 'despair', 'pain', 'dreams', 'life', 'was', 'happening.His', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'excellent', 'great', 'mix', 'very', 'different', 'characters', 'drunk', 'loud', 'jealous', 'brother', 'extremely', 'shy', 'woman', 'heart', 'gold', 'underneath', 'insecurities', 'top', 'glory', 'hungry', 'boxing', 'champ', 'old', 'disgruntled', 'trainer', 'dreams', 'managing', 'champ.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'people', 'appreciate', 'very', 'real', 'fact', 'took', 'Stallone', 'few', 'days', 'write', 'script', 'how', 'had', 'fight', 'studios', 'let', 'play', 'lead', 'How', 'different', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'studios', 'first', 'choice', 'Ryan', ""O'Neal"", 'played', 'lead', 'role.Will', 'Stallone', 'ever', 'play', 'finer', 'role', 'did', 'original', 'Rocky', 'Probably', 'not', 'was', 'Rocky', 'way', 'possible', 'was', 'amazing', 'have', 'let', 'viewers', 'experience', 'ourselves']",N/A
134839,A1C7QKP8PU0XS8,079283321X,yosunnyjoe,"[0, 0]","This 1976 classic stars Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa in his story about a club fighter with 56 fights. He never mentions how many losses (probably many) however he does say he never got his nose broke. He is a  street tough with a good heart and bad luck and makes his real money as an  enforcer for the mob. His good heart gets him a stern but polite repremand  from his boss because he refused to break someones thumb. He meets Adrian  (Talia Shire) a pet shop clerk with low self esteem as he shops for his  pets. Talia Shire is almost comical but loveable as an overly shy and  homely 30 year old. Rocky sees her pretty face through her short hair, old  lady glasses and garb. When she asks Rocky why he wants to fight his  humorous replies go from, &quot;You have got to be a moron if you want to  be a fighter&quot;, to &quot;Because I can't sing or dance.&quot; Balboa  may sound dumb but his character alleges otherwise. In comes The  Bicentennal fight in which Hevyweight champ Apollo Creed calls on Rocky to  be his opponent because his scheduled contender has gone south. True this  is a farytale story because you have to believe while the champs record is  34 and 0 Rocky's is more like 30 and 26. Rocky however is Italian, Columbus  discovered America and it's 1976 the Bicentennial. This bout was meant as  an entertaining farce in where the champ gives some unknown a chance and  easily whips him. Rocky works out for this bash like it's do or die and  proves to Creed winning is not the only way to be tough!",5,The Great White Hope Masterpiece,960940800,"06 14, 2000",2000,1531,"['1976', 'classic', 'stars', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'story', 'club', 'fighter', '56', 'fights', 'never', 'mentions', 'how', 'many', 'losses', 'probably', 'many', 'however', 'say', 'never', 'got', 'nose', 'broke', 'street', 'tough', 'good', 'heart', 'bad', 'luck', 'real', 'money', 'enforcer', 'mob', 'good', 'heart', 'stern', 'polite', 'repremand', 'boss', 'refused', 'break', 'someones', 'thumb', 'Adrian', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'pet', 'shop', 'clerk', 'low', 'self', 'esteem', 'pets', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'almost', 'comical', 'loveable', 'overly', 'shy', 'homely', '30', 'year', 'old', 'Rocky', 'pretty', 'face', 'short', 'hair', 'old', 'lady', 'glasses', 'garb', 'When', 'Rocky', 'why', 'fight', 'humorous', 'replies', 'go', 'quot', 'have', 'got', 'be', 'moron', 'want', 'be', 'fighter', 'quot', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'dance.', 'quot', 'Balboa', 'may', 'sound', 'dumb', 'character', 'otherwise', 'Bicentennal', 'fight', 'Hevyweight', 'champ', 'Apollo', 'Creed', 'Rocky', 'be', 'opponent', 'scheduled', 'contender', 'gone', 'south', 'True', 'farytale', 'story', 'have', 'believe', 'champs', 'record', '34', '0', 'Rocky', 'more', '30', '26', 'Rocky', 'however', 'Italian', 'Columbus', 'discovered', 'America', '1976', 'Bicentennial', 'bout', 'was', 'meant', 'entertaining', 'farce', 'where', 'champ', 'chance', 'easily', 'Rocky', 'out', 'bash', 'do', 'die', 'Creed', 'winning', 'not', 'only', 'way', 'be', 'tough']",N/A

The movie Rocky is not only one of greatest and most memorable films ever made, it also leaves a mark on each viewer who has seen this masterpiece of a movie. I can't help but smile when I see Sylvester Stallone's training sequence because it means so much more than what meets the eye. It symbolizes a dream every single person has had at one time in their lives, the desire to achieve that dream no matter what anyone believes or says.
