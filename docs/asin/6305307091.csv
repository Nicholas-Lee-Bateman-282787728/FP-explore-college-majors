459466,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,6305307091,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[22, 27]","Based quite rigidly on the best selling novel by Louis L'Amour, we find Sean Connery in the lead role here complete with Scottich brogue, that sits OK despite being a dusty, rough around the edges hero. Not often seen on reruns, and I don't know why this film didn't get much exposure, as many people I know haven't seen it, or even heard of it. I'm tempted to say at this point, that this is not a movie that will live long in the memory, but don't be put off - it has a strangely compelling quality and realistic feel, and a better than average script. There a number of violent scenes, most notably the grissly demise of one of the lead characters (I won't say who) at the hands of a vicious band of Indians, and you could draw some comparisons with the content of movies like &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; although that came along several years after this. On the whole this is a good solid western, with great acting pretty much all round, the 60's film style is evident in Ms Bardot's stunning appearance throughout, despite her supposedly being in the dusty back of beyondville, but this is nothing to get too upset about. I was pleased to see this come to the DVD market, and hope it will reach the wider audience it deserves.

459467,ARFBRSE35ZJ6A,6305307091,Bill W. Dalton,"[23, 26]","With the cast this movie has--Sean Connery, Brigitte Bardot, Jack Hawkins, Stephen Boyd, Honor Blackman, Peter van Eyck, Valerie French, and Woody Strode--and based on a novel by Louis L'Amour (and with a foreword by him) this should have been a much better Western than it is!  It's a slow moving tale of a hunting party that becomes the hunted party.  Shalako (the name means ""rain bringer"" in Zuni Indian), played by Connery, rescues a group of European noblefolk on a hunting expedition in New Mexico in the 1880s after they run afoul of hostile Apaches, who like to hunt, too; they like to hunt the ""white-eyes,"" whether European or home-grown, who invade their territory!This DVD has no bonus features at all, not even the theatrical trailer!  Just a scene selector menu.  But the image quality is quite good and you have a choice of widescreen or full frame.  Sean Connery looks good in his buckskins and six-shooter, in his prime before the gray beard and bald pate.  Brigitte Bardot is simply gorgeous, as is Honor Blackman (GOLDFINGER, THE AVENGERS TV series.)  I recommend this DVD as a novelty item mostly, for Connery fans (it's his only Western--if you don't count OUTLAND!) and Bardot fans (it's her only Western, too--if you don't count LES PETROLEUSES, a French-Italian oater!)I first saw this movie at my favorite drive-in theater in `68, and the only thing I remembered about it was Bardot's modestly demure bare back scene, until I saw it again on this DVD edition.

459469,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,6305307091,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[2, 3]","I'm not sure the exact moment ""Shalako"" became a comedy, but by film's end, I was laughing out loud. I'm usually lenient with older films, and this 1968 western most certainly falls into that category. Based on Louis L'Amour's novel ""Shalako"" and directed by dependable veteran Edward Dmytryk (who gave us the great unheralded western ""Warlock""), ""Shalako"" should have been one of those interesting finds one discovers when wading through anti-hero westerns of the era.Fresh from his turn as James Bond in ""You Only Live Twice,"" Sean Connery plays the title character, a cynical, buckskin-clad tracker who has little use for civilization. Well, society arrives in the form of an arrogant clique of British aristocracy traveling across the wilds on a hunting trip. They stop their wagons to sit at dinner tables adorned with candelabras while sipping champagne and dining with the shiniest of cutlery. Unbeknownst to them, they've crossed into Apache territory. Shalako rides up all dusty and essentially says (add Scottish accent), ""You're going to get keeled.""The English troupe is a hip, colorful lot, including the likes of Brigitte Bardot, Jack Hawkins, Peter Van Eyck, Honor Blackman and even a smirking Stephen Boyd as a corrupt tracker. They all have stories, endless stories, in this overly-plotted film. Bardot, a sexy dame no doubt, prances around with go-go hair and goth eye shadow perfectly applied throughout the duration of the movie. She's surrounded by some Injuns whom Shalako reluctantly kills. Shalako has a pow-wow with the Apache leader, played by the great Woody Strode (""Goal Dust: The Warm and Candid Memoirs of a Pioneer Black Athlete and Actor""), who delivers a line straight from the Jay Silverheels' era, ""Shalako good. Leave by sun-up or we kill white man."" Yes, even in 1968 black actors were still playing Native Americans.If the Brits were to leave, there would be no film. So they stay, believing superior intellect and well-oiled hunting rifles should more-than-suffice against the untamed savage. They hole up in an old fort and after the deaths of many men, realize the error of their ways. In an exhausting roundabout way, the aristocracy find themselves on foot in the desert, with Shalako leading them to hills and water. Filmed on the plains of Spain, we have yet another European western possessing awkward topography, dubbed supporting casts and Caucasian men in wigs trying to appear Native American (I know, Sergio Leone got away with this).Anyway, while our desperate crew hikes across the sunny slopes of endless sand, they appear to be hot, but clothes remain unruffled and there's not a drop of sweat to be found. Connery and Bardot find time to make googly eyes, consummating their attraction next to a waterhole with the threat torturous death hanging over them. Go Shalako Go! Death eventually arrives, but the Indians have the good sense to charge one at a time, making for easy target practice. I will give ""Shalako"" credit for one scene, surprisingly brutal, when Indians surround a female captive and tear her clothes away, forcing her to swallow her own diamond necklace. The scene, usually edited for family TV, is included on the DVD.Things come to a fatigued head when Sean and Woody meet face-to-face and decide to duel to the death...with spears! I realized we had entered Mel Brooks territory, and the laughs began. The film's peculiar final shot, almost purposefully flat, appears to show Bardot leaving her troupe and joining Sean. I suppose she had a mighty good time next to that waterhole. They could live next to it, dining nightly on prickly pear, but where is she going to buy mascara?!To see this film done right, check out ""The Law and Jake Wade"" or ""Hombre"" instead.",2,Go Shalako Go!,1253145600,"09 17, 2009",2009,3740,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'exact', 'moment', 'Shalako', 'became', 'comedy', 'film', 'end', 'was', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', ""'m"", 'usually', 'lenient', 'older', 'films', '1968', 'western', 'most', 'certainly', 'category', 'Based', 'Louis', ""L'Amour"", 'novel', 'Shalako', 'directed', 'dependable', 'veteran', 'Edward', 'Dmytryk', 'who', 'gave', 'great', 'unheralded', 'western', 'Warlock', 'Shalako', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'interesting', 'one', 'discovers', 'when', 'wading', 'anti-hero', 'westerns', 'era.Fresh', 'turn', 'James', 'Bond', 'Only', 'Live', 'Twice', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'title', 'character', 'cynical', 'buckskin-clad', 'tracker', 'who', 'little', 'use', 'civilization', 'Well', 'society', 'arrives', 'form', 'arrogant', 'clique', 'British', 'aristocracy', 'traveling', 'wilds', 'hunting', 'trip', 'stop', 'wagons', 'sit', 'dinner', 'tables', 'adorned', 'candelabras', 'sipping', 'champagne', 'dining', 'shiniest', 'cutlery', 'Unbeknownst', ""'ve"", 'crossed', 'Apache', 'territory', 'Shalako', 'dusty', 'essentially', 'add', 'Scottish', 'accent', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'keeled', 'English', 'troupe', 'hip', 'colorful', 'lot', 'including', 'likes', 'Brigitte', 'Bardot', 'Jack', 'Hawkins', 'Peter', 'Van', 'Eyck', 'Honor', 'Blackman', 'even', 'smirking', 'Stephen', 'Boyd', 'corrupt', 'tracker', 'have', 'stories', 'endless', 'stories', 'overly-plotted', 'film', 'Bardot', 'sexy', 'dame', 'doubt', 'prances', 'go-go', 'hair', 'goth', 'eye', 'perfectly', 'applied', 'duration', 'movie', 'surrounded', 'Injuns', 'whom', 'Shalako', 'reluctantly', 'Shalako', 'pow-wow', 'Apache', 'leader', 'played', 'great', 'Woody', 'Strode', 'Goal', 'Dust', 'Warm', 'Candid', 'Memoirs', 'Pioneer', 'Black', 'Athlete', 'Actor', 'who', 'line', 'straight', 'Jay', 'Silverheels', 'era', 'Shalako', 'good', 'Leave', 'sun-up', 'kill', 'white', 'man', 'Yes', 'even', '1968', 'black', 'actors', 'were', 'still', 'playing', 'Native', 'Americans.If', 'Brits', 'were', 'leave', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'stay', 'believing', 'superior', 'intellect', 'well-oiled', 'hunting', 'rifles', 'should', 'more-than-suffice', 'untamed', 'savage', 'hole', 'up', 'old', 'fort', 'deaths', 'many', 'men', 'realize', 'error', 'ways', 'exhausting', 'roundabout', 'way', 'aristocracy', 'find', 'foot', 'desert', 'Shalako', 'leading', 'hills', 'water', 'Filmed', 'plains', 'Spain', 'have', 'yet', 'European', 'western', 'possessing', 'awkward', 'topography', 'dubbed', 'supporting', 'casts', 'Caucasian', 'men', 'wigs', 'trying', 'appear', 'Native', 'American', 'know', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'got', 'away', '.Anyway', 'desperate', 'crew', 'hikes', 'sunny', 'slopes', 'endless', 'sand', 'appear', 'be', 'hot', 'clothes', 'remain', 'unruffled', 'not', 'drop', 'sweat', 'be', 'found', 'Connery', 'Bardot', 'find', 'time', 'make', 'googly', 'eyes', 'consummating', 'attraction', 'waterhole', 'threat', 'torturous', 'death', 'hanging', 'Go', 'Shalako', 'Go', 'Death', 'eventually', 'Indians', 'have', 'good', 'sense', 'charge', 'one', 'time', 'making', 'easy', 'target', 'practice', 'will', 'give', 'Shalako', 'credit', 'one', 'scene', 'surprisingly', 'brutal', 'when', 'Indians', 'surround', 'female', 'captive', 'tear', 'clothes', 'away', 'forcing', 'swallow', 'own', 'diamond', 'necklace', 'scene', 'usually', 'edited', 'family', 'TV', 'included', 'DVD.Things', 'come', 'fatigued', 'head', 'when', 'Sean', 'Woody', 'meet', 'face-to-face', 'decide', 'duel', 'death', 'spears', 'realized', 'had', 'entered', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'territory', 'laughs', 'began', 'film', 'peculiar', 'final', 'shot', 'almost', 'purposefully', 'flat', 'show', 'Bardot', 'leaving', 'troupe', 'joining', 'Sean', 'suppose', 'had', 'mighty', 'good', 'time', 'next', 'waterhole', 'could', 'live', 'next', 'dining', 'nightly', 'prickly', 'pear', 'where', 'going', 'buy', 'mascara', 'see', 'film', 'done', 'right', 'check', 'Law', 'Jake', 'Wade', 'Hombre', 'instead']",N/A

It follows the book fairly well, although there's a rather creative addition where one of the women has gone off with the bad guys and gets killed by the Indians in a pretty ironic, and strange, way.

Still, it's a pretty good story, especially if you've read the book.  Briefly, it's about a group of European aristocrats, with a few Americans thrown in, who come to the West to ""hunt wild animals"" although the leader is hoping to encounter Indians also.

459472,A8WZ4YFQB77HC,6305307091,"EddieLove ""EddieLove""","[3, 3]","The twin manias of 60s cinema -- the Euro-Spy craze inspired by James Bond and the ""Spaghetti Western""-- seem to find their nexus here in the lone Western to star Sean Connery. It's based on a Louis L'Amour novel.  I recall it strangely had a reputation as being dark and violent, ala those ""revisionist Westerns"" of the late 60s, so-called as their penchant for often sadistic violence or sensuality distinguished them from the tame TV fare that around that time dominated the airwaves and was killing off the genre.The film revolves around a group of pampered and titled Europeans who go on a hunting party in the American west. They're indifferent to the treaties that restrict hunting on certain lands, and when Apache's attack, their only hope is the former Army tracker who warned them in the first place -- the mysterious Shalako played by Connery. (Their worries also include the mustache-twirling hunter they've hired whose beady eyes are on one of the ladies in the group as well as their pricey jewelery.)You can tell that the filmmakers are conscious of transplanting Connery to the prior century. For the first half of the film he doesn't do much, but we still get lots of scenes of him on his horse to get the 60s audience comfortable with the idea that he's not 007. And this kind of works, because while these scenes have no significance to the story -- and do pad the running time -- you do marvel at how good he is on horseback. Even when he takes center-stage and his considerable presence dominates the action, he has a solid ensemble to work with. I think there were over half a dozen names above the title here. They're a wild cross-section of European and American (semi) stars, and they're all good. The stand-outs may be Stephen Boyd (always as good as he is underrated) as the villain, and Honor Blackman as the haughtiest lady in the party. (I think this has to be the only time Connery was reunited with a Bond girl.)Unlike other European Westerns from the time, there seems to have been contemporaneous sound captured for this, so we don't get that standard dubbed soundtrack you get with most Spaghetti Westerns. Indeed, for Brigette Bardot as the female lead, I used the DVD subtitle option, as I couldn't make out much of her dialogue. She's the other main attraction here, besides Connery, and her blinding blondness is fetching, if not exactly heart-stopping. She has a couple of romantic scenes with Sean that are cheesy, but fun.Like other films based on L'Amour novels, this one has a solid plot and characters. It's a little over-long, but it holds up -- thanks mainly to the seriousness that went into ther direction and performances for the non-action scenes. These set things up so that we're invested in what happens.This isn't a groundbreaking Western from the period. But it is fun, with heroics, romance and solid action. Connery fans will be more than satisfied.",4,Bond on the Range,1272153600,"04 25, 2010",2010,2908,"['twin', 'manias', '60s', 'cinema', 'Euro-Spy', 'craze', 'inspired', 'James', 'Bond', 'Spaghetti', 'Western', 'seem', 'find', 'nexus', 'here', 'lone', 'Western', 'star', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'based', 'Louis', ""L'Amour"", 'novel', 'recall', 'strangely', 'had', 'reputation', 'being', 'dark', 'violent', 'ala', 'revisionist', 'Westerns', 'late', '60s', 'so-called', 'penchant', 'often', 'sadistic', 'violence', 'sensuality', 'distinguished', 'tame', 'TV', 'fare', 'time', 'dominated', 'airwaves', 'was', 'killing', 'off', 'genre.The', 'film', 'group', 'pampered', 'titled', 'Europeans', 'who', 'go', 'hunting', 'party', 'American', 'west', ""'re"", 'indifferent', 'treaties', 'restrict', 'hunting', 'certain', 'lands', 'when', 'Apache', 'attack', 'only', 'hope', 'former', 'Army', 'tracker', 'who', 'warned', 'first', 'place', 'mysterious', 'Shalako', 'played', 'Connery', 'worries', 'also', 'include', 'mustache-twirling', 'hunter', ""'ve"", 'hired', 'beady', 'eyes', 'are', 'one', 'ladies', 'group', 'as', 'well', 'pricey', 'jewelery', 'can', 'tell', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'conscious', 'transplanting', 'Connery', 'prior', 'century', 'first', 'half', 'film', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'still', 'get', 'lots', 'scenes', 'horse', 'get', '60s', 'audience', 'comfortable', 'idea', 'not', '007', 'kind', 'works', 'scenes', 'have', 'significance', 'story', 'do', 'pad', 'running', 'time', 'do', 'marvel', 'how', 'good', 'horseback', 'Even', 'when', 'center-stage', 'considerable', 'presence', 'action', 'solid', 'ensemble', 'work', 'think', 'were', 'dozen', 'names', 'title', 'here', ""'re"", 'wild', 'cross-section', 'European', 'American', 'semi', 'stars', ""'re"", 'good', 'stand-outs', 'may', 'be', 'Stephen', 'Boyd', 'always', 'as', 'good', 'underrated', 'villain', 'Honor', 'Blackman', 'haughtiest', 'lady', 'party', 'think', 'be', 'only', 'time', 'Connery', 'was', 'reunited', 'Bond', 'girl', 'other', 'European', 'Westerns', 'time', 'have', 'been', 'contemporaneous', 'sound', 'captured', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'standard', 'dubbed', 'soundtrack', 'get', 'most', 'Spaghetti', 'Westerns', 'Indeed', 'Brigette', 'Bardot', 'female', 'lead', 'used', 'DVD', 'subtitle', 'option', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'out', 'much', 'dialogue', 'other', 'main', 'attraction', 'here', 'Connery', 'blinding', 'blondness', 'fetching', 'not', 'exactly', 'heart-stopping', 'couple', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'Sean', 'are', 'cheesy', 'other', 'films', 'based', ""L'Amour"", 'novels', 'one', 'solid', 'plot', 'characters', 'little', 'over-long', 'up', 'thanks', 'mainly', 'seriousness', 'went', 'ther', 'direction', 'performances', 'non-action', 'scenes', 'set', 'things', 'up', 'so', ""'re"", 'invested', 'what', 'happens.This', ""n't"", 'groundbreaking', 'Western', 'period', 'fun', 'heroics', 'romance', 'solid', 'action', 'Connery', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'satisfied']",N/A
459473,A276M3NSIY9B82,6305307091,Harry Brewer,"[2, 4]","Sean Connery's only Western is certainly an oddity. The failure isn't Connery's fault, he acquits himself rather well. Most might think it very strange that he was cast in this role but the casting was of Connery was perfect. The movie is based on the novel of the same name written by Louis L'Amour; the character of Shalako from the book had an European background &, for reasons that escape me at the moment, he immigrated to America. In fact, much of the film follows L'Amour's novel closely. As it states in the opening credits of the film many Europeans visited the West on hunting expeditions.Where the movie fails should be blamed on the production company. It was a British film company that was produced this & they didn't have much experience for this endeavor. Edward Dmytryk (Broken Lance, The Caine Mutiny) was chosen to counter this lack of experience. But Dmytryk hadn't directed but a handful of Western up to this point. The casting of Brigitte Bardot was simply atrocious. I'm not saying she couldn't act but English was not her language. She certainly was easy on the eyes but this does not make her right for the role. The casting of the British hunting party had no problems; Peter Van Eyck (Von Hallstatt), Honor Blackman (Lady Daggett) & Jack Hawkins (Sir Daggett) were all Brits portraying Brits. Nothing wrong with Stephen Boyd playing the nefarious heavy, Bosky Fulton. But Woody Strode (Chato) as an Indian was another BIG stretch. Strode was an underrated actor & he was adequate in the role but it was completely wrong. I know, it isn't the first time an Indian was portrayed in the movies by someone who didn't have a drop of Indian blood.The scene that has stayed with me the most (40 years, in fact) is when the Indians catch the coach. The last survivor is Lady Daggett & when she's straddled by a brave she attempts to bribe him with an expensive piece of jewelry. This is funny to the brave & he forces her to swallow it & she dies. This was brutal for 1968 & I still find it chilling.But for all the things wrong with the movie it's still decent. Connery is great at anything he does & I love watching actors cast against type.

""Spaghetti"" westerns (filmed in Italy or Spain) were quite the rage in the late 1960's and ""Shalako"" is about what you would get if ""Hombre"" (1967) had been given a mild ""Spaghetti"" treatment.While not even remotely on the level of Monte Hellman's stuff, ""Shalako"" is an entertaining and comprehensible western that most viewers will get into and enjoy until about the  mark when the wheels fall off and it drags along to a less than spectacular resolution.Dmytryk was a veteran action director who occasionally (""The Young Lions"") even did a good job of directing actors for the camera. This was one of his last efforts and he seems to have stayed focused on the action and paid little attention to the performances themselves.Connery plays the title character, an experienced frontiersman who (like Paul Newman in ""Hombre"") is forced by circumstances into guiding a bunch of clueless civilians to safety. ""Hombre"" had Newman (a white man raised by Indians) in the moral dilemma of having to assist a group of people for which he has total contempt. Shalako ' s situation is simpler: he must extract a European aristocrat's hunting party who have ticked off the Apache's by coming onto their reservation and who have been betrayed by their cowboy hunting guides. Although he has little use for most of this group he has developed a grudging respect for a plucky countess (Bardot). There is decent chemistry in the early Connery-Bardot scenes but it does not sustain itself as the relationship begins to turn romantic.As in ""Hombre"" there is an interesting twist with the young wife (Honor Blackman) of one of the aristocrats deciding to leave her husband for the dangerous cowboy (Stephan Boyd) who has just placed the group at the mercy of the elements (and the Indians). Blackman is excellent in this part , the only really challenging role in the production.Dmytryk does an excellent job with his first three action sequences, including a surprisingly credible dawn attack on the camp of the hunting party and a more traditional stagecoach chase sequence. But as already mentioned, the film is extremely front-end loaded and he has dissipated all the tension before the climatic sequence even begins.""Hombre"" on the other hand withheld its best sequence until the end and managed to pack some nice irony into its resolution. You won't find this in ""Shalako"", in fact the final 20 minutes are so listless your mind begins mulling over the plot holes. Like how did Boyd's character manage to walk all the way to the top of the plateau without being detected by the Indians? When you have to insert a detailed verbal explanation for something totally inexplicable (that has happened ""off"" camera) a competent editor knows that it is time for some major trimming and a focused director begins revising his script.Then again, what do I know?

A plus in this film.It was more fun though to see the length of Bardot's hair vary from scene to scene and be amazed at how heavy and PERFECT her eyemake-up always remained.

459487,AK61LQI92GTCH,6305307091,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[10, 14]","Edward Dmytryk is one of my favorite directors.  Thanks to the miracle of dvd technology I've been allowed to watch good prints of such classic dark crime dramas as `Crossfire' and `Murder, My Sweet' (a movie that some claim invented what is now known as `film noir.')  I've seen maybe his most famous movie, `The Caine Mutiny,' as well as a handful of western gems, including `Broken Lance' and that great, underrated and too-often overlooked masterpiece `Warlock.'Saturated as I was in such cinematic excellence I wasn't quite prepared for SHALAKO, a stagnant horse opera adapted from what must have been a better book by Louis L'Amour.  I'm inclined to blame it on the sixties.  Or Brigette Bardot, who is little more expressive than a pouting china doll and possessed of an accent thick enough to cut a week old baguette.  Maybe Jupiter wasn't yet aligned with Mars.... To be fair, though, I think my hero Eddie D. has to held accountable for this yawner.  SHALAKO is not the best work, or anywhere near the best, of any of the participants.Sean Connery plays Shalako (the name rhymes with `calico') and Bardot plays Countess Irina Lazaar, a wealthy European who travels with other European royalty to hunt wild game in the great, unsettled southwest.  Stephen Boyd plays a grungy galoot who leads the Euro royals - replete with white-gloved butlers, comely maids and formal attire - through the wilderness.  That Boyd has led them deep into the heart of an Apache reservation we learn early on. The Apaches' less-than-enthusiastic reaction to this intrusion is established soon after.  Although made in 1968, a year by which most movies knew better, the natives in SHALAKO are the whooping, hollering, blood thirsty savage kind, although a couple of Apaches wade out of the gore for speaking parts.  African American actor Woody Strode plays Chato, a young chief with a gun in his mitts and a chip on his shoulder.  Strode was a good actor who was in a ton of westerns, and casting him in the part diffuses, or at least confuses, accusations of casting non- Natives as American Indians.  Still, Strode's chief  is of the if-I-kill-Shalako-my-soul-will-walk-free ilk.  In other words, after a quick, obligatory mumble about broken treaties the film hustles back to the reliable same old, same old.Shalako spends most of the movie leading the Europeans away from Chief Woody and his blood thirsties, and, I think, falling in love with Countess Bardot.  I think.  Beyond the pout Bardot isn't terribly expressive, and her thick accent didn't help.  She was either falling in love or asking for a limburger sandwich.  I think they were falling in love.  With his rugged charm and ironic wit Connery has always been more than capable of throwing a movie on his shoulders and carrying it to the winner's circle on his own.  Unfortunately, here he plays it grim and laconic, more or less depriving this movie of any chance it might have had.  SHALAKO isn't a terrible movie, but it's an uninspired and uninspiring one.",2,Shalako,1126137600,"09 8, 2005",2005,3016,"['Edward', 'Dmytryk', 'one', 'favorite', 'directors', 'Thanks', 'miracle', 'dvd', 'technology', ""'ve"", 'been', 'allowed', 'watch', 'good', 'prints', 'such', 'classic', 'dark', 'crime', 'dramas', 'Crossfire', 'Murder', 'My', 'Sweet', 'movie', 'claim', 'invented', 'what', 'now', 'known', 'film', 'noir', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'maybe', 'most', 'famous', 'movie', 'Caine', 'Mutiny', 'as', 'well', 'handful', 'western', 'gems', 'including', 'Broken', 'Lance', 'great', 'underrated', 'too-often', 'overlooked', 'masterpiece', 'Warlock', ""'Saturated"", 'was', 'such', 'cinematic', 'excellence', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'prepared', 'SHALAKO', 'stagnant', 'horse', 'opera', 'adapted', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'book', 'Louis', ""L'Amour"", ""'m"", 'inclined', 'blame', 'sixties', 'Brigette', 'Bardot', 'who', 'little', 'more', 'expressive', 'pouting', 'china', 'doll', 'possessed', 'accent', 'thick', 'enough', 'cut', 'week', 'old', 'baguette', 'Maybe', 'Jupiter', 'was', ""n't"", 'yet', 'aligned', 'Mars', 'be', 'fair', 'think', 'hero', 'Eddie', 'D.', 'held', 'accountable', 'yawner', 'SHALAKO', 'not', 'best', 'work', 'anywhere', 'best', 'participants.Sean', 'Connery', 'Shalako', 'name', 'calico', 'Bardot', 'Countess', 'Irina', 'Lazaar', 'wealthy', 'European', 'who', 'travels', 'other', 'European', 'royalty', 'hunt', 'wild', 'game', 'great', 'unsettled', 'southwest', 'Stephen', 'Boyd', 'grungy', 'galoot', 'who', 'Euro', 'royals', 'replete', 'white-gloved', 'butlers', 'comely', 'maids', 'formal', 'attire', 'wilderness', 'Boyd', 'led', 'deep', 'heart', 'Apache', 'reservation', 'learn', 'early', 'Apaches', 'less-than-enthusiastic', 'reaction', 'intrusion', 'established', 'soon', 'made', '1968', 'year', 'most', 'movies', 'knew', 'better', 'natives', 'SHALAKO', 'are', 'whooping', 'hollering', 'blood', 'thirsty', 'savage', 'kind', 'couple', 'Apaches', 'wade', 'gore', 'speaking', 'parts', 'African', 'American', 'actor', 'Woody', 'Strode', 'Chato', 'young', 'chief', 'gun', 'mitts', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'Strode', 'was', 'good', 'actor', 'who', 'was', 'ton', 'westerns', 'casting', 'part', 'least', 'confuses', 'accusations', 'casting', 'non-', 'Natives', 'American', 'Indians', 'Still', 'Strode', 'chief', 'if-I-kill-Shalako-my-soul-will-walk-free', 'ilk', 'other', 'words', 'quick', 'obligatory', 'mumble', 'broken', 'treaties', 'film', 'back', 'reliable', 'same', 'old', 'same', 'old.Shalako', 'most', 'movie', 'leading', 'Europeans', 'away', 'Chief', 'Woody', 'blood', 'thirsties', 'think', 'falling', 'love', 'Countess', 'Bardot', 'think', 'pout', 'Bardot', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'expressive', 'thick', 'accent', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'was', 'either', 'falling', 'love', 'asking', 'limburger', 'sandwich', 'think', 'were', 'falling', 'love', 'rugged', 'charm', 'ironic', 'wit', 'Connery', 'always', 'been', 'more', 'capable', 'throwing', 'movie', 'shoulders', 'carrying', 'winner', 'circle', 'own', 'Unfortunately', 'here', 'grim', 'laconic', 'more', 'less', 'depriving', 'movie', 'chance', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'SHALAKO', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'movie', 'uninspired', 'uninspiring', 'one']",N/A

A enjoyable off-beat western called Shalako that is not that well known considering the cast.  In the 1870s in New Mexico, a hunting party full of European nobles is making its way through an Apache reservation, hunting as they go.  But the Apaches have been pushed too far, telling the hunting party they have just one day to leave before they attack.  An ex-Army colonel, Shalako Carlin, must lead the group to safety before the Apache war party closes in and finishes them off.  For a western that isn't that well known, I was pleasantly surprised with Shalako.  Imagine a mix of American and spaghetti westerns and you get this movie.  The locations are beautiful, you'll probably spot some from other spaghettis, the action is pretty decent, and the story is simple, but it keeps you entertained from beginning to end.  Give this western a try, it's worth a watch.The ensemble cast full of recognizable names works very well together.  In what I think was his only western, Sean Connery plays Shalako Carlin, the ex-Army colonel who finds himself trying to save the lives of the stranded hunting party.  Connery seems to be enjoying the part, and it shows.  French beauty Brigitte Bardot plays Countess Irina Lazaar, who takes an instant liking to Shalako, even though an arranged wedding with Peter van Eyck's Baron Frederick has been set up.  Bardot is good in the part, and as expected, she's easy on the eyes.  van Eyck also turns in a good performance as the Baron who finds himself battling with Shalako before finally siding with him.  Some other members of the hunting party include an underused Jack Hawkins, a treacherous Honor Blackman, and Alexander Knox and Valerie French as a U.S. senator and his wife.  Stephen Boyd is perfectly slimy as Bosky Fulton, the trail guide who abandons the party.  In a small part, Woody Strode plays Apache chief Chato and pulls it off in a strange way.  Julian Mateos and Don Barry are also strong as Rojas and Buffalo, two men Shalako can count on in such a dangerous situation.The DVD offers a nice-looking widescreen presentation, but that's about it.  No special features or anything are included.  Of course, I'd love to see interviews with Connery or Bardot, but that's probably wishful thinking.  I would have settled for a trailer or something though.  Anyways, Shalako is an exciting western with a very good cast that is not the most well-known western from the 60s, but don't let its obscurity scare you away.

After the Europeans are abandoned by their guides they are helped by an intrepid loner named Shalako (Connery). Can they make it out alive?As you can see, this European film has a lot going for it. It's based on a Louis L'Amour novel and has a great cast. Yet, it bombed when it was originally released, but it's actually a very good realistic Western. Besides, how can you go wrong with Sean Connery and Brigitte Bardot?Disregarding the horrible title song, the opening is reminiscent of ""Duel at Diablo"" and the rest of the film resembles ""Hombre,"" which were both released in the late 60s as well. ""Shalako"" has the same tone, so if you like those films you'll probably appreciate ""Shalako.""Although there's a lot of good Western action, including one excellent long battle sequence between the whites and the Natives there's quite a bit of drama. As such, I encourage you to utilize the subtitles due to the heavily-accented dialogue; it helps you to keep up with the story and characters. There's also some good character definement.The film is a story of arrogance and betrayal -- the arrogance of the Europeans who have no respect for the ""lowbred"" cowboys or ""savages,"" and the betrayal of the American guides, headed excellently by Stephen Boyd (Messala in ""Ben-Hur""). But, to my pleasure, ""Shalako"" is mostly a survival story. I love survival stories, like ""Sands of the Kalahari"" and ""Flight of the Phoenix."" This brings to mind other survival-themed Westerns like ""Escape from Fort Bravo,"" ""They Came to Cordura"" and ""Duel at Diablo."" ""Shalako"" stands well with these films.Can you believe Woody Strode, a black man, is cast as the main Native American antagonist? It works, believe it or not, as he looks convincingly Indian.THE BABE REPORT: Of course, Brigitte Bardot is one of the most beautiful women to ever grace God's earth. With the exception of one bathing scene she's dressed to the hilt throughout. But -- man -- she has such a cute, pouty face and incredible locks of full blond hair. Interestingly, she was chosen to play Bond's love interest in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" (the only non-Connery Bond picture of the 60s with George Lazenby as Bond), but she was ironically booked with Connery doing this movie. Honor Blackman, who played Pussy Galore in ""Goldfinger,"" is also on hand. I never thought she was all that beautiful, although I like her as an actor.Of great interest to me was the appearance of the underrated brunette Valerie French. She played the hottie in ""Jubal"" (1956) when she was 28. ""Shalako"" was her final film and she was 40 at the time of release. She's mainly a background character but she does have some lines and you'll catch quite a few good glimpses of her. She's almost as beautiful as Bardot, albeit brunette. And, no, it makes no difference that she's 40.FINAL ANALYSIS: I fully expected to not like ""Shalako"" due to the bad or lukewarm reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. The critics are way off. This is a really good late-60's Western. Those with ADHD might not like it cause there's a lot of character-defining drama, but I found it worthwhile for all the above reasons.Some criticize the ending as ridiculous, but I liked it. Would it likely happen in real life? Probably not. But I didn't find it all that unbelievable. In other words, the filmmakers pulled it off. It's a good MOVIE ending. That's why they went with it.GRADE: B+",4,1968 Survival Western with Sean Connery & Brigitte Bardot (and Valerie French),1216166400,"07 16, 2008",2008,3836,"['DIRECTOR', 'Edward', 'DmytrykWRITERS', 'Louis', ""L'Amour"", 'novel', 'Clarke', 'Reynolds', 'screenplay', 'CAST', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Brigitte', 'Bardot', 'Sephen', 'Boyd', 'Honor', 'Blackman', 'Jack', 'Hawkins', 'Woody', 'Strode', 'Valerie', 'FrenchRUNTIME', '1', 'hour', '53', 'minutesLOCATIONS', 'SpainCOUNTRY', 'UK/West', 'GermanyTHE', 'STORY', 'pompous', 'group', 'European', 'nobles', 'hunting', 'vacation', 'New', 'Mexico', 'are', 'beset', 'band', 'Apaches', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'trespassing', 'lands', 'Europeans', 'are', 'abandoned', 'guides', 'are', 'helped', 'intrepid', 'loner', 'named', 'Shalako', 'Connery', 'Can', 'make', 'out', 'alive', 'can', 'see', 'European', 'film', 'lot', 'going', 'based', 'Louis', ""L'Amour"", 'novel', 'great', 'cast', 'bombed', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'realistic', 'Western', 'Besides', 'how', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Brigitte', 'Bardot', 'Disregarding', 'horrible', 'title', 'song', 'opening', 'reminiscent', 'Duel', 'Diablo', 'rest', 'film', 'Hombre', 'were', 'released', 'late', '60s', 'as', 'well', 'Shalako', 'same', 'tone', 'so', 'like', 'films', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'appreciate', 'Shalako', 'lot', 'good', 'Western', 'action', 'including', 'one', 'excellent', 'long', 'battle', 'sequence', 'whites', 'Natives', 'quite', 'bit', 'drama', 'such', 'encourage', 'utilize', 'subtitles', 'due', 'heavily-accented', 'dialogue', 'keep', 'up', 'story', 'characters', 'also', 'good', 'character', 'definement.The', 'film', 'story', 'arrogance', 'betrayal', 'arrogance', 'Europeans', 'who', 'have', 'respect', 'lowbred', 'savages', 'betrayal', 'American', 'guides', 'headed', 'excellently', 'Stephen', 'Boyd', 'Messala', 'Ben-Hur', 'pleasure', 'Shalako', 'mostly', 'survival', 'story', 'love', 'survival', 'stories', 'Sands', 'Kalahari', 'Flight', 'Phoenix', 'mind', 'other', 'survival-themed', 'Westerns', 'Escape', 'Fort', 'Bravo', 'Came', 'Cordura', 'Duel', 'Diablo', 'Shalako', 'well', 'films.Can', 'believe', 'Woody', 'Strode', 'black', 'man', 'cast', 'main', 'Native', 'American', 'antagonist', 'believe', 'not', 'convincingly', 'Indian.THE', 'BABE', 'REPORT', 'course', 'Brigitte', 'Bardot', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'ever', 'grace', 'God', 'earth', 'exception', 'one', 'bathing', 'scene', 'dressed', 'hilt', 'man', 'cute', 'pouty', 'face', 'incredible', 'locks', 'full', 'blond', 'hair', 'Interestingly', 'was', 'chosen', 'play', 'Bond', 'love', 'interest', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'Secret', 'Service', 'only', 'non-Connery', 'Bond', 'picture', '60s', 'George', 'Lazenby', 'Bond', 'was', 'ironically', 'booked', 'Connery', 'doing', 'movie', 'Honor', 'Blackman', 'who', 'played', 'Pussy', 'Galore', 'Goldfinger', 'also', 'hand', 'never', 'thought', 'was', 'beautiful', 'like', 'actor.Of', 'great', 'interest', 'was', 'appearance', 'underrated', 'brunette', 'Valerie', 'French', 'played', 'hottie', 'Jubal', '1956', 'when', 'was', '28', 'Shalako', 'was', 'final', 'film', 'was', '40', 'time', 'release', 'mainly', 'background', 'character', 'have', 'lines', ""'ll"", 'catch', 'quite', 'few', 'good', 'glimpses', 'almost', 'as', 'beautiful', 'Bardot', 'brunette', 'difference', '40.FINAL', 'ANALYSIS', 'fully', 'expected', 'not', 'Shalako', 'due', 'bad', 'lukewarm', 'reviews', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'critics', 'are', 'way', 'really', 'good', 'late-60', 'Western', 'ADHD', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'cause', 'lot', 'character-defining', 'drama', 'found', 'above', 'reasons.Some', 'criticize', 'ending', 'ridiculous', 'liked', 'Would', 'likely', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'Probably', 'not', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'unbelievable', 'other', 'words', 'filmmakers', 'pulled', 'off', 'good', 'MOVIE', 'ending', 'why', 'went', 'it.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A
