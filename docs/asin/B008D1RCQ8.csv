1550657,A3K4PY8LFVW6VU,B008D1RCQ8,George Kelly Th,"[1, 3]","DONT BE FOOLED BY THE FAN BOYS Of The Show.1st off let me say season 1 was great slow paced but great show season 2 not so much. Despite what some say the Funi dub leaves alot to be desired imho.Cheri leigh i thought i could get used to doin Shana's voice but it just doesnt work for me wich is a shame since i loved her work in everything else ive seen her in as well as the rest of the Funi cast. Really they coulda done a better job of dubing it, with all the talented VA's they have most of the male and female VA's they used just didnt come close to the Ocean Crew wich is sad since they have VA's that sound alot alike the Ocean Crews VA's.Another thing if u listen to the japanise dialog and then the Funi dub they dont match up on alot of the consevation. 1 place in paticular was when Margerie Daw is explaing to 1 of the girls about love/hate/jealosy ect the american explanition wasnt nearly as good or to the point as the japanise or as well done.Then theirs the show itself the 1st 18 episodes. Basically what happens in 18 episodes coulda been told in 5 or 6 because very litle happens. I felt like i was watching alot of filler garbage, now i dont no how this played out in the magna cause i have never seen or read it but thats what it felt like. The last 6 episodes is where things start to pick up.I've seen 100's of animie so maybe this is why season 2 seems like something ive seen 100 times over it just doesnt hold up to season 1 or season 3.Also most of the character development and story prgression that we had in season 1 is pretty well gone for most of season2. At least till we get to around episode 18/19.Then the price of almost 100$At best season 2 is just average i would give the show over all a 3 star rateing but with it being at almost 100$ i can only give the product not the show a 2 star rateing.",3,shakagun no shana season 2,1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,1835,"['DONT', 'BE', 'FOOLED', 'BY', 'THE', 'FAN', 'BOYS', 'Show.1st', 'off', 'let', 'say', 'season', '1', 'was', 'great', 'slow', 'paced', 'great', 'show', 'season', '2', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'say', 'Funi', 'dub', 'alot', 'be', 'desired', 'imho.Cheri', 'leigh', 'i', 'thought', 'i', 'could', 'get', 'used', 'doin', 'Shana', 'voice', 'just', 'doesnt', 'work', 'wich', 'shame', 'i', 'loved', 'work', 'everything', 'else', 'ive', 'seen', 'as', 'well', 'rest', 'Funi', 'cast', 'Really', 'coulda', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'dubing', 'talented', 'VA', 'have', 'most', 'male', 'female', 'VA', 'used', 'just', 'didnt', 'come', 'close', 'Ocean', 'Crew', 'wich', 'sad', 'have', 'VA', 'sound', 'alot', 'Ocean', 'Crews', ""VA's.Another"", 'thing', 'u', 'listen', 'japanise', 'dialog', 'then', 'Funi', 'dub', 'dont', 'match', 'up', 'alot', 'consevation', '1', 'place', 'paticular', 'was', 'when', 'Margerie', 'Daw', 'explaing', '1', 'girls', 'love/hate/jealosy', 'ect', 'american', 'explanition', 'wasnt', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'point', 'japanise', 'as', 'well', 'show', '1st', '18', 'episodes', 'Basically', 'what', '18', 'episodes', 'coulda', 'been', 'told', '5', '6', 'very', 'litle', 'happens', 'felt', 'i', 'was', 'watching', 'alot', 'filler', 'garbage', 'now', 'dont', 'how', 'played', 'out', 'magna', 'cause', 'i', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'read', 'what', 'felt', 'last', '6', 'episodes', 'where', 'things', 'start', 'pick', 'up.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', '100', 'animie', 'so', 'maybe', 'why', 'season', '2', 'something', 'ive', 'seen', '100', 'times', 'just', 'doesnt', 'hold', 'up', 'season', '1', 'season', '3.Also', 'most', 'character', 'development', 'story', 'prgression', 'had', 'season', '1', 'pretty', 'well', 'gone', 'most', 'season2', 'least', 'till', 'get', 'episode', '18/19.Then', 'price', 'almost', '100', 'best', 'season', '2', 'just', 'average', 'i', 'would', 'give', 'show', '3', 'star', 'rateing', 'being', 'almost', '100', 'i', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'product', 'not', 'show', '2', 'star', 'rateing']",N/A

His new attitude creates a rift between Shana, Yoshida, and himself. Eita also distances himself after seeing Ogata's death. Even though she was able to be revived, the sight of his dying love leads him to abandon Marjorie. After some terrible experiences, the bonds that the group has built strengthen. The news about Yuji's unborn sibling also helps Yuji decide to stay in Misaki City. Just as he realizes this, and is about to choose between Yoshida and Shana, The Ball Masque appears. Hecate removes the Midnight Lost Child and uses it to awaken a giant monster. Marjorie, Wilhelmina, and Shana go to save him. But will they be able to prevent his disappearance?This is an excellent 2nd season. My first thought was, ""holy crap! All the voice actors are different."" Yes, all the voice actors from season 1 were replace. No it's not a bad thing. It took a few episodes to get used to, but you should recognize all the new cast members. They all do a very good job. So I wouldn't worry about it. The bulk of season 2 is spent on character development. That's a good thing in my book. The key to a truly great anime is character development and a great story. This anime has both. There are a few battles. The Caprice of Beauty, the one who created Yuji's treasure, arrives and presents a challenge. There is also another Crimson Denizen, called Sabrac. He shows up and nearly defeats his old rival Wilhelmina. Plus the epic final battle with Ball Masque. Shakugan No Shana has great animation, voice acting, characters, and a very good soundtrack. There is action, comedy, drama, romance, and suspense. This is an incredible anime. It has worked its way into my list of favorites, and I can't wait to see season 3. I think there's a lot to love here for every anime fan.",5,A Great 2nd Season!

The second pretty much opens up immediately after the end of the first season and while there is some given information on the characters if you haven't seen the first season you'll probably get lost so before getting this one I'd advise getting the first season set.  While like many of the recent Funimation set releases this on comes in two parts and while somewhat pricey I've become a fan of the series so there for don't have to much of a complaint about the price.  The animation and soundtrack are pretty much the same as first season though if you want a comparison I'd say the animation matches up probably with series like Kaze No Stigma or Sekirei somewhat. If you're still undecided about getting this second season set because of the new dubbed voice cast you can watch an episode or two of the series dubbed online either on Hulu or Funimation's channel or the secondary site on youtube but I'm sure after watching those episodes you'll have no problem getting this set for your anime collection.",5,If You Have The First Season The The Second Is A Must,1352764800,"11 13, 2012",2012,1429,"['Finally', 'almost', 'four', 'years', 'second', 'season', 'Shakugan', 'No', 'Shana', 'being', 'released', 'fans', 'here', 'States', 'will', 'feel', 'little', 'sad', 'loss', 'talented', 'dubbing', 'cast', 'first', 'season', 'cast', 'Funimation', 'have', 'proven', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'talented', 'doing', 'roles', 'second', 'though', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'talented', 'subbed', 'voice', 'cast', 'very', 'grateful', 'are', 'first', 'season', 'second', 'pretty', 'much', 'up', 'immediately', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'given', 'information', 'characters', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'first', 'season', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'get', 'lost', 'so', 'getting', 'one', ""'d"", 'advise', 'getting', 'first', 'season', 'set', 'many', 'recent', 'Funimation', 'set', 'two', 'parts', 'somewhat', 'pricey', ""'ve"", 'become', 'fan', 'series', 'so', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'complaint', 'price', 'animation', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'first', 'season', 'want', 'comparison', ""'d"", 'say', 'animation', 'up', 'probably', 'series', 'Kaze', 'No', 'Stigma', 'Sekirei', 'somewhat', ""'re"", 'still', 'undecided', 'getting', 'second', 'season', 'set', 'new', 'dubbed', 'voice', 'cast', 'can', 'watch', 'episode', 'two', 'series', 'dubbed', 'Hulu', 'Funimation', 'channel', 'secondary', 'site', 'youtube', ""'m"", 'sure', 'watching', ""'ll"", 'have', 'problem', 'getting', 'set', 'anime', 'collection']",N/A
