Yah, although the theme of this film is not about cocaine per se (and it is not explicitly mentioned and only introduced by a knowing low-life nose candy mimic from newly- minted gangster (stage gangster, that is) Humphrey Bogart) that line can serve as a metaphor for what this film is about. In theory it is about superstition (the old chestnut probably no used much anymore about the fate of the last of third on a match, an old wives tale but just in case, beware, okay. But really it is about going from riches to rags quick when that nose candy puts the squeeze on you.Despite my plaintive plea the three gals in this story Mary, Ruth, and Vivian who have known each other since grade school (which we are aware of fromthe beginning shots that set the story line up) play this devilish game out when they met later in life during the Great Depression. Naturally poor little distracted, alienated, and bored rich girl Vivian was the last and thus fated to die first. And she does, after leaving her husband (and child in the end) for some hustling Dan who shows her the bright lights of the city, and introduces her to the free life, and that wicked cocaine, falls on hard times and, in an act of contrition saves her son from some evil ransom scheme by some mobsters who old Dan owes money to by committing suicide. Yah, leave that girl stuff alone.

293326,A2YOVFK64PL60K,6302041104,"""alixy""","[7, 7]","This movie may be short, but it has a lot of action packed into it!  Beautiful Ann Dvorak plays a discontented wife who leaves her wealthy husband and runs off with a 1930's type sleeze-ball. Her best friends from school, Joan Blondell and Bette Davis comfort her heartbroken husband, played by Warren William, and Joan ends up as wife #2.  Bette Davis' talents are completely wasted in this movie, and it's odd to see Warren William in a role where he isn't a seducer or leacherous boss.  The story steamrolls to it's conclusion, as Dvorak's son is kidnapped by  her lover's gang and the repentant mother must act quickly to save his young life.  When this movie ends, somewhat predictably, you kind of breathe out a heavy sigh! It's hard to believe that the whole movie plays out in a little over an hour!

293327,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6302041104,Bobby Underwood,"[2, 2]","""Some people get all the luck."" -- Ruth to Mary""I wonder."" -- Mary as she and Ruth watch Vivian's driver take her awayFor those interested in the frankness of Hollywood films during the early 1930's in dealing with subjects that would become taboo just a few years later, Three On a Match is required viewing. Thanks to director Mervyn LeRoy and a marvelous cast, some who were not yet big, but would be, this is much more than just a pre-code curio. It is a very good film which manages to cover decades in the lives of three women in just over a single jam-packed hour. It is frank, sometimes raw, yet tender and involving. In the end it is tragic. Ann Dvorak is wonderful and Joan Blondell memorable, as is a young Ann Shirley, billed here in 1932 as Dawn O'Day.LeRoy had a knack for making you care about his characters and their plight, which was also in evidence in the other memorable film he helmed in 1932, I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang. By showing the girls in school, their personalities and vulnerabilities on full display as they grow up, we both better understand and have empathy for their actions, especially Dvorak's Vivian. As the young Vivian, Ann Shirley is marvelous, and strikingly pretty just as Dvorak was, capturing the inner restlessness despite her privileged upbringing. Virginia Davis is also quite lovely as the free-spirited Mary, and seems as though she really is the younger version of Joan Blondell. Betty Carse is sweet and subdued as the poor Ruth, and makes for a perfect transition to a young and blonde Betty Davis. The Davis persona did not yet exist, and I find her quite refreshing in this film.The director used newspaper headlines to mark the passage of time and it works wonders, cramming decades into minutes, making the viewer feel like they are actually following every moment as the three girls mature and go their separate ways. In a good way, it sort of gives the impression to the viewer they've watched a two hour film rather than one which barely clocks in over an hour. The story begins in 1919 and hinges on a superstition borne from the trenches of the Great War, that if you left a match lit long enough to light three cigarettes, the third was marked for death. When the three schoolmates have a reunion of sorts, catching up on their lives since school, it is the rich but unhappy Vivian who gets the last flaming ember, and starts her decent.Blondell is simply terrific as the vivacious member of the trio, having spent time in the pen and working as a showgirl. In a smaller role, Davis is quite nice as the regular girl working her way into respectability. It is Dvorak's nervous energy as Vivian which drives this film, however. Alive but not living, bored with her rich husband and empty existence, her inner desires will be unleashed by Lyle Talbot. He is no good, and her decent into the rough world of addiction and crime becomes so complete that only Mary's concern for her child saves him from the same fate. It is here that a romance develops between Mary and Vivian's ex, Robert Kirkwood (Warren William), with her friend Ruth acting as nanny to Vivian's son.But it is the days of gangsters and depravity, and when the boy is kidnapped a manhunt ensues. Talbot is appropriately weak and slimy as Vivian's connection. It is a very young Bogart who impresses, however, as boss Edward Arnold's unfeeling henchman. A strung out Dvorak shines in a shattering climax when she redeems her lost soul, giving this raw film an ending as happy as could be expected. Leonard Maltin gives a brief introduction and has a few words at the film's conclusion. One of the finest of the early 1930's pre-code films, it has bite with substance, and not one, but two terrific performances. Blondell and Dvorak are incredible here and fans of this genre and time in American cinema would do well picking up this one.",5,A Lasting Flame,1257033600,"11 1, 2009",2009,3870,"['people', 'get', 'luck', 'Ruth', 'Mary', 'wonder', 'Mary', 'Ruth', 'watch', 'Vivian', 'driver', 'take', 'awayFor', 'interested', 'frankness', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'early', '1930', 'dealing', 'subjects', 'would', 'become', 'taboo', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'Three', 'Match', 'required', 'viewing', 'Thanks', 'director', 'Mervyn', 'LeRoy', 'marvelous', 'cast', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'yet', 'big', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'pre-code', 'curio', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'cover', 'decades', 'lives', 'three', 'women', 'just', 'single', 'jam-packed', 'hour', 'frank', 'sometimes', 'raw', 'yet', 'tender', 'involving', 'end', 'tragic', 'Ann', 'Dvorak', 'wonderful', 'Joan', 'Blondell', 'memorable', 'young', 'Ann', 'Shirley', 'billed', 'here', '1932', 'Dawn', ""O'Day.LeRoy"", 'had', 'knack', 'making', 'care', 'characters', 'plight', 'was', 'also', 'evidence', 'other', 'memorable', 'film', 'helmed', '1932', 'Am', 'Fugitive', 'Chain', 'Gang', 'showing', 'girls', 'school', 'personalities', 'vulnerabilities', 'full', 'display', 'grow', 'up', 'better', 'understand', 'have', 'empathy', 'actions', 'especially', 'Dvorak', 'Vivian', 'young', 'Vivian', 'Ann', 'Shirley', 'marvelous', 'strikingly', 'pretty', 'just', 'Dvorak', 'was', 'capturing', 'inner', 'restlessness', 'privileged', 'upbringing', 'Virginia', 'Davis', 'also', 'quite', 'lovely', 'free-spirited', 'Mary', 'really', 'younger', 'version', 'Joan', 'Blondell', 'Betty', 'Carse', 'sweet', 'subdued', 'poor', 'Ruth', 'perfect', 'transition', 'young', 'blonde', 'Betty', 'Davis', 'Davis', 'persona', 'did', 'not', 'yet', 'exist', 'find', 'quite', 'refreshing', 'film.The', 'director', 'used', 'newspaper', 'headlines', 'mark', 'passage', 'time', 'wonders', 'cramming', 'decades', 'minutes', 'making', 'viewer', 'feel', 'are', 'actually', 'following', 'moment', 'three', 'girls', 'mature', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'good', 'way', 'sort', 'impression', 'viewer', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'two', 'hour', 'film', 'rather', 'one', 'barely', 'hour', 'story', '1919', 'hinges', 'superstition', 'borne', 'trenches', 'Great', 'War', 'left', 'match', 'lit', 'long', 'enough', 'light', 'three', 'cigarettes', 'third', 'was', 'marked', 'death', 'When', 'three', 'schoolmates', 'have', 'reunion', 'sorts', 'catching', 'up', 'lives', 'school', 'rich', 'unhappy', 'Vivian', 'who', 'last', 'flaming', 'ember', 'decent.Blondell', 'simply', 'terrific', 'vivacious', 'member', 'trio', 'having', 'spent', 'time', 'pen', 'working', 'showgirl', 'smaller', 'role', 'Davis', 'quite', 'nice', 'regular', 'girl', 'working', 'way', 'respectability', 'Dvorak', 'nervous', 'energy', 'Vivian', 'film', 'however', 'Alive', 'not', 'living', 'bored', 'rich', 'husband', 'empty', 'existence', 'inner', 'desires', 'will', 'be', 'unleashed', 'Lyle', 'Talbot', 'good', 'decent', 'rough', 'world', 'addiction', 'crime', 'becomes', 'so', 'complete', 'only', 'Mary', 'concern', 'child', 'same', 'fate', 'here', 'romance', 'Mary', 'Vivian', 'ex', 'Robert', 'Kirkwood', 'Warren', 'William', 'friend', 'Ruth', 'acting', 'as', 'nanny', 'Vivian', 'son.But', 'days', 'gangsters', 'depravity', 'when', 'boy', 'kidnapped', 'manhunt', 'ensues', 'Talbot', 'appropriately', 'weak', 'slimy', 'Vivian', 'connection', 'very', 'young', 'Bogart', 'who', 'however', 'boss', 'Edward', 'Arnold', 'unfeeling', 'henchman', 'strung', 'out', 'Dvorak', 'shines', 'shattering', 'climax', 'when', 'lost', 'soul', 'giving', 'raw', 'film', 'ending', 'as', 'happy', 'could', 'be', 'expected', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'brief', 'introduction', 'few', 'words', 'film', 'conclusion', 'One', 'finest', 'early', '1930', 'pre-code', 'films', 'bite', 'substance', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'terrific', 'performances', 'Blondell', 'Dvorak', 'are', 'incredible', 'here', 'fans', 'genre', 'time', 'American', 'cinema', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'picking', 'up', 'one']",Three on a Match VHS
293328,ATZ3VBJ6CVDEI,6302041104,Ciccocenta,"[6, 6]","This movie is GREAT. a lost gem of a film that is little known & very rarely shown on TV (except for TCM now & then). Lots of good early performances of people who went on to bigger & better things (Joan Blondell, Anne Shirley as a child, Humphrey Bogart & Bette Davis) & like some have said, if you're getting this film for Bette Davis, you may be a bit disapointed. This movie was filmed was during the very begining of her movie career before she became the brazen, cigarette-puffing, pop-eyed drama-queen she created. The charisma was barely there & her character has no real drama to speak of, neverless she gives a sweet quality to the passive girl she plays in the movie. If anything check it out to get a peek at what she looked like before she started aging. I dont think I've ever seen a movie w/ her looking so youthful. She was pretty cute, kinda looked like Madonna a little.But anyway Joan Blondell is great as the street-wise sassy she always plays, but this is Ann Dvoraks film & she gives a stellar performance as the privelaged wife of Warren William who spirals from high class society matron to Low life druggie in a performance that will leave you speechless.Joan, Ann & Bette start off as youngsters in a female Juvenille Hall & the film shows how each went their seperate ways as they grew up, w/ Miss Dvorak hitting the highs then the skids pretty fast. I wont give any more details except to say that this is a really good film from start to finish & will be interesting to anyone who likes their stories gritty & realistic whether a fan of b&W; films or not.I know people who do not like classic b&w; films as i do, but they were pretty glued to this film because of the acting & beleivable storyline that shows how easily a person can decline from drugs & bad associations.",5,Great Early Performances of Hollywoods Best!,1038528000,"11 29, 2002",2002,1800,"['movie', 'GREAT', 'lost', 'gem', 'film', 'little', 'known', 'very', 'rarely', 'shown', 'TV', 'TCM', 'now', 'then', 'Lots', 'good', 'early', 'performances', 'people', 'who', 'went', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'Joan', 'Blondell', 'Anne', 'Shirley', 'child', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'have', 'said', ""'re"", 'getting', 'film', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'disapointed', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'was', 'very', 'begining', 'movie', 'career', 'became', 'brazen', 'cigarette-puffing', 'pop-eyed', 'drama-queen', 'created', 'charisma', 'was', 'barely', 'character', 'real', 'drama', 'speak', 'neverless', 'sweet', 'quality', 'passive', 'girl', 'movie', 'anything', 'check', 'out', 'get', 'peek', 'what', 'looked', 'started', 'aging', 'dont', 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'w/', 'looking', 'so', 'youthful', 'was', 'pretty', 'cute', 'kinda', 'looked', 'Madonna', 'little.But', 'anyway', 'Joan', 'Blondell', 'great', 'street-wise', 'sassy', 'always', 'Ann', 'Dvoraks', 'film', 'stellar', 'performance', 'privelaged', 'wife', 'Warren', 'William', 'who', 'spirals', 'high', 'class', 'society', 'matron', 'Low', 'life', 'druggie', 'performance', 'will', 'leave', 'speechless.Joan', 'Ann', 'Bette', 'start', 'off', 'youngsters', 'female', 'Juvenille', 'Hall', 'film', 'how', 'went', 'seperate', 'ways', 'grew', 'up', 'w/', 'Miss', 'Dvorak', 'hitting', 'highs', 'then', 'skids', 'pretty', 'fast', 'wont', 'give', 'more', 'details', 'say', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'anyone', 'who', 'stories', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'fan', 'b', 'W', 'films', 'not.I', 'know', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'classic', 'b', 'w', 'i', 'do', 'were', 'pretty', 'glued', 'film', 'acting', 'beleivable', 'storyline', 'how', 'easily', 'person', 'can', 'decline', 'drugs', 'bad', 'associations']",Three on a Match VHS

How long has the three girls melodrama format existed? This time out the three are girls who went to school together as kids and meet again as adults. Joan Blondell is the trouble maker girl who went to reform school and somehow now is a Broadway star. Bette Davis was the class valedictorian who's now a stenographer andAnn Dvorak was the most popular girl in school who married well and has a little cutsey pie dimply Campbells Soup can son. But bored Ann's perfect life is not what it seems and on a cruise ship she indulges in a purely sexual relationship with gambler Lyle Talbot. I loved this part because it depicted total child neglect. Ann becomes a wanton and God knows what else. Joan Blondell is worried about the little boy so she rats Ann out to her filthy rich husband Warren William and ends up marrying him when he divorces Ann. He also makes Bette Davis the new governess! Gambler Talbot gets in trouble with loan sharks and a young and evil Humphrey Bogart goes after him for gambling debts. Lyle and Ann's only hope is to kidnap her dimpled son and ransom him off! Things proceed to go to hell. One of the most unusual aspects of this film is that the girl who goes to reform school is actually reformed and is the moral center of this lurid little universe!

293331,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,6302041104,Douglas M,"[3, 3]","In the early thirties, Warner Brothers specialised in hard hitting ""small"" films which were torn from the headlines. Many of their output are the least dated of all films from that period even though they were often made on a shoe string. ""Three on a Match"" is a good example. The film runs for just over an hour and never was the pace faster. The plot tracks the the lives of three school friends who renew friendship at lunch, lighting their cigarettes on a single match, an action with superstitious repercussions.Ann Dvorak plays the bored wife of wealthy Warren William. Joan Blondell plays the ex-reform school showgirl with a heart of gold. Bette Davis plays a mousy secretary who becomes Dvorak's son's nanny. The plot involves the kidnapping of Dvorak's son by a particularly brutal group of thugs including the young and very nasty Humphrey Bogart. Kidnappings were in the news in 1932.Ann Dvorak proves that she should have become a much bigger star. She was a precursor to Davis without the mannerisms, acting with a realism which was unusual in 1932. Warren William and Joan Blondell are first rate and Davis is very attractive but has a very small part and no character to play at all. This is one of the few films in which she displayed ""cheescake"", in a bathing costume at the beach and in a slip in another scene.Sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll, well jazz anyway.

When I saw my local video store announced it as ""scandalous enough to upset the sensibilities of even the most jaded modern viewer"", I couldn't quite believe it but had to take a look.  As it turns out, in the first five minutes of the film a very young school girl shows off her bloomers to the boys before smoking a cigarette with some of her classmates!  And there was more good stuff after that.  Three on a Match is of course dated and stagy like all early talkies (I thought Ann Dvorak's acting in the lead was by far the worst), but if you are interested in cinema history you really have to see it.  The whole film, even with Leonard Maltin's intro and epilogue, breezes by in less than 70 minutes.  I hope they give this Forbidden Hollywood series a DVD set release like the earlier Film Noir and Gangster films have now received.Some final thoughts on the cast: 24 year old Bette Davis has a very small role but is absolutely delicious as a cute little blond.  I have gone thru her photos and it appears she rapidly morphed into the form she later became better known for sometime during the late 1930s; an astonishing and most unfortunate transformation (enjoy it why it lasts, Mena Suvari!).  Also worth watching to see Humphrey Bogart in a small role as a low-ranking gangster.  And you should check out the talented Warren William (Robert Kirkwood) in a much more flattering role in Capra's fantastic little 1933 hit, Lady for a Day.",4,You've found it...  this is what pre-code is all about!!!,1107388800,"02 3, 2005",2005,1565,"['have', 'been', 'pre-code/early-talkie', 'kick', 'late', 'so', 'was', 'bound', 'come', 'film', 'sooner', 'later', 'When', 'saw', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'announced', 'scandalous', 'enough', 'upset', 'sensibilities', 'even', 'most', 'jaded', 'modern', 'viewer', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'believe', 'had', 'take', 'look', 'out', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'film', 'very', 'young', 'school', 'girl', 'bloomers', 'boys', 'smoking', 'cigarette', 'classmates', 'was', 'more', 'good', 'stuff', 'Three', 'Match', 'course', 'dated', 'stagy', 'early', 'talkies', 'thought', 'Ann', 'Dvorak', 'acting', 'lead', 'was', 'far', 'worst', 'are', 'interested', 'cinema', 'history', 'really', 'have', 'see', 'whole', 'film', 'even', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'intro', 'epilogue', 'breezes', 'less', '70', 'minutes', 'hope', 'give', 'Forbidden', 'Hollywood', 'series', 'DVD', 'set', 'release', 'earlier', 'Film', 'Noir', 'Gangster', 'films', 'have', 'now', 'received.Some', 'final', 'thoughts', 'cast', '24', 'year', 'old', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'very', 'small', 'role', 'absolutely', 'delicious', 'cute', 'little', 'blond', 'have', 'gone', 'thru', 'photos', 'rapidly', 'morphed', 'form', 'later', 'became', 'better', 'known', 'sometime', 'late', '1930s', 'astonishing', 'most', 'unfortunate', 'transformation', 'enjoy', 'why', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'Also', 'worth', 'watching', 'see', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'small', 'role', 'low-ranking', 'gangster', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'talented', 'Warren', 'William', 'Robert', 'Kirkwood', 'much', 'more', 'flattering', 'role', 'Capra', 'fantastic', 'little', '1933', 'hit', 'Lady', 'Day']",Three on a Match VHS

Blondell was the wild one who did time in reform school and is now a funloving showgirl.  Dvorak was the popular one who married well and is now completely unfulfilled.  Davis was the smart who is now working as a stenographer.  When they light their cigarettes using the same match, superstition says one will die.  The film focuses mostly on Dvorak, whose life spirals out of control in a number of surprisingly frank scenes (this was pre-Code Hollywood).  Dvorak is excellent as usual, bringing depth to her character.  It's too bad she is largely forgotten today.  Blondell delivers another solid performance, while Davis barely registers in a badly underwritten role that requires her to be pleasant and nothing else.  The supporting cast is full of familiar faces, including Humphrey Bogart, Warren William, Ann Shirley, Glenda Farrell, Edward Arnold, Allen Jenkins, and Clara Blandick (Auntie Em!).  The vices of drugs and alcohol are realistically presented here in a way that may surprise you (notice Dvorak wiping her nose after what we assume is cocaine use!).  Director Mervyn LeRoy packs a lot into the film's short running time, and despite the seventy years that have passed since it was made, it seems remarkably fresh for today's audiences.

Mary Keaton (Joan Blondell), is a former tomboy who left reform school to become an entertainer.  Vivian Revere (Ann Dvorak), is married to a prominent attorney and has a son.  Ruth Westcott (Bette Davis), has graduated from secretarial school and has a job as a stenographer.  While the girls talk, they light their cigarettes from a single match and laugh off the old superstition that the third person to use the match, Vivian, will soon die.  Vivian decides to take her son on a cruise and invites Mary and Ruth to the bon voyage party.  But Vivian is attracted to mobster Mike Loftus (Lyle Talbot), who shows up with Mary and ends up running off with him.  Vivian's husband, Robert Kirkwood (Warren William), finds Vivian with Mary's help, divorces his wife, gets custody of his son (Buster Phelps), hires Ruth as the boy's companion, and asks Mary to marry him.  Meanwhile, Vivian has turned to drinking and drugs, while Loftus ends up hiring three thugs (one of whom is Humphrey Bogart) to kidnap Vivian's son.Bette Davis' name is used to sell this film on videotape, but she has the least of the three female leads to do in this story, which is excessively melodramatic to say the least.  Actually, Bogart's bit part is more important to the plot.  What makes this film notable is that it was made before the Hays Office established the code that cleaned up the movies.  &quot;Three on a Match&quot; was remade by Warners in 1938 as &quot;Broadway Musketeers,&quot; with Ann Sheridan, Margaret Lindsay and Marie Wilson playing the three friends.",4,A melodrama of three young women tempting fate,994204800,"07 4, 2001",2001,1671,"['1932', 'film', 'directed', 'Mervyn', 'LeRoy', 'three', 'old', 'girl', 'friends', 'school', 'meet', 'bring', 'other', 'up', 'date', 'Mary', 'Keaton', 'Joan', 'Blondell', 'former', 'tomboy', 'who', 'left', 'reform', 'school', 'become', 'entertainer', 'Vivian', 'Revere', 'Ann', 'Dvorak', 'married', 'prominent', 'attorney', 'son', 'Ruth', 'Westcott', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'graduated', 'secretarial', 'school', 'job', 'stenographer', 'girls', 'talk', 'light', 'cigarettes', 'single', 'match', 'old', 'superstition', 'third', 'person', 'use', 'match', 'Vivian', 'will', 'soon', 'die', 'Vivian', 'take', 'son', 'cruise', 'Mary', 'Ruth', 'bon', 'voyage', 'party', 'Vivian', 'attracted', 'mobster', 'Mike', 'Loftus', 'Lyle', 'Talbot', 'who', 'up', 'Mary', 'up', 'running', 'off', 'Vivian', 'husband', 'Robert', 'Kirkwood', 'Warren', 'William', 'Vivian', 'Mary', 'help', 'wife', 'custody', 'son', 'Buster', 'Phelps', 'Ruth', 'boy', 'companion', 'Mary', 'marry', 'Meanwhile', 'Vivian', 'turned', 'drinking', 'drugs', 'Loftus', 'up', 'hiring', 'three', 'thugs', 'one', 'whom', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'kidnap', 'Vivian', 'son.Bette', 'Davis', 'name', 'used', 'sell', 'film', 'videotape', 'least', 'three', 'female', 'leads', 'do', 'story', 'excessively', 'melodramatic', 'say', 'least', 'Actually', 'Bogart', 'bit', 'part', 'more', 'important', 'plot', 'What', 'film', 'notable', 'was', 'made', 'Hays', 'Office', 'established', 'code', 'cleaned', 'up', 'movies', 'quot', 'Three', 'Match', 'quot', 'was', 'remade', 'Warners', '1938', 'quot', 'Broadway', 'Musketeers', 'quot', 'Ann', 'Sheridan', 'Margaret', 'Lindsay', 'Marie', 'Wilson', 'playing', 'three', 'friends']",Three on a Match VHS

As it is a pre-Hays code film, it has not had the life sucked out of it and, consequently, tells a decidedly juicy story, brilliantly directed by the legendary Mervyn LeRoy.The film tells of three young women who went to public school together as children and, meeting again ten years later, become friends. All three appear to have done well for themselves. Mary (Joan Blondell), who had been wild as a child, has grown up to be a vivacious, good hearted showgirl, while Ruth (Bette Davis), the smartest, went on to business school and is now a stenographer. Vivian (Ann Dvorak), the most popular as a child, is now married to a handsome, prominent and wealthy attorney (Warren William), with whom she has an adorable little boy. Yet, with so much, Vivian, the envy of the other two, is disatisfied with her gilded life. As all three reminisce over lunch one day, they light their cigarettes from one match, laughingly defying the supersition that three on a match means one of the three will die.Soon after, the dissatisfied Vivian goes on a cruise with her young son, leaving her husband behind. At a bon voyage party on the ship, she hooks up with good looking Mike Loftus (Lyle Talbot), and her life spirals out of control. She soon gets more excitement than she bargained for. Her new life style impacts on Mary and Ruth in ways that they could not have imagined. It also ultimately brings her into contact with a brutal mobster, Harve (Humphrey Bogart), as the movie draws to its climax. If you want to know what kind of excitement the viewer is in for, think the following: booze, crime, drugs, gambling, sex, and violence. All this is crammed into a film that runs for sixty four action packed minutes.Mervyn Leroy managed to tell a full blooded, three dimensional story, using film montages and film clips of national and world events to move the film along in time. He exacted bravura, stellar performances from the entire cast, and turned out a film with a shocking and surprising ending that is still riveting in today's day and age. This is a remarkably fine film that those who love classic movies, as well as a great story, will enjoy.The video also provides some brief, but interesting,  commentary by film historian Leonard Maltin.",5,OUTSTANDING VINTAGE FILM...,1011484800,"01 20, 2002",2002,2320,"['absolutely', 'loved', '1932', 'movie', 'had', 'riveted', 'screen', 'pre-Hays', 'code', 'film', 'not', 'had', 'life', 'sucked', 'consequently', 'decidedly', 'juicy', 'story', 'brilliantly', 'directed', 'legendary', 'Mervyn', 'LeRoy.The', 'film', 'tells', 'three', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'went', 'public', 'school', 'together', 'children', 'meeting', 'again', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'become', 'friends', 'three', 'appear', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'Mary', 'Joan', 'Blondell', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'wild', 'child', 'grown', 'up', 'be', 'vivacious', 'good', 'hearted', 'showgirl', 'Ruth', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'smartest', 'went', 'business', 'school', 'now', 'stenographer', 'Vivian', 'Ann', 'Dvorak', 'most', 'popular', 'child', 'now', 'married', 'handsome', 'prominent', 'wealthy', 'attorney', 'Warren', 'William', 'whom', 'adorable', 'little', 'boy', 'so', 'much', 'Vivian', 'envy', 'other', 'two', 'disatisfied', 'gilded', 'life', 'three', 'reminisce', 'lunch', 'one', 'day', 'light', 'cigarettes', 'one', 'match', 'laughingly', 'defying', 'supersition', 'three', 'match', 'one', 'three', 'will', 'die.Soon', 'dissatisfied', 'Vivian', 'cruise', 'young', 'son', 'leaving', 'husband', 'behind', 'bon', 'voyage', 'party', 'ship', 'up', 'good', 'looking', 'Mike', 'Loftus', 'Lyle', 'Talbot', 'life', 'spirals', 'control', 'soon', 'more', 'excitement', 'bargained', 'new', 'life', 'style', 'impacts', 'Mary', 'Ruth', 'ways', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'imagined', 'also', 'ultimately', 'contact', 'brutal', 'mobster', 'Harve', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'movie', 'climax', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'excitement', 'viewer', 'think', 'following', 'booze', 'crime', 'drugs', 'gambling', 'sex', 'violence', 'crammed', 'film', 'sixty', 'four', 'action', 'packed', 'minutes.Mervyn', 'Leroy', 'managed', 'tell', 'full', 'blooded', 'three', 'dimensional', 'story', 'using', 'film', 'montages', 'film', 'clips', 'national', 'world', 'events', 'move', 'film', 'time', 'exacted', 'bravura', 'stellar', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'turned', 'out', 'film', 'shocking', 'surprising', 'ending', 'still', 'riveting', 'today', 'day', 'age', 'remarkably', 'fine', 'film', 'who', 'love', 'classic', 'movies', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'story', 'will', 'enjoy.The', 'video', 'also', 'brief', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'film', 'historian', 'Leonard', 'Maltin']",Three on a Match VHS

293344,A37S3ACL57LN62,6302041104,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[3, 3]","Three on a Match is a superstition begun by a matchmaker who wanted to sell more matches. Supposedly, if three people light the same cigarette on one match, the third to do so will die. The story begins in a schoolyard where three girls are at recess. There is a mischievious girl who smokes and shows her bloomers to everyone named Mary (Joan Blondell), a prissy popular one named Vivien (Ann Dvorak), and a smart but quite one named Ruth (Bette Davis). They all follow different paths; Mary goes to reform school and then becomes an actress, Vivien gets married and has an adorable little boy, and Ruth goes to business school and then to work. The three meet and have lunch together. As they light their cigarettes with one match, the end is foreshadowed by the fact that Vivien lights her cigarette last.The events that follow are the reason why this movie is included in the Forbidden Hollywood series. There is adultery, neglect of a small child, drug use, and organized crime. It is a fast paced, short but thrilling movie.Blondell is great in her role. She is beautiful, witty, and natural. Dvorak does not fare so well; most of her lines sound scripted and awkward, making the main character hard to believe. Davis's part is small and she is mostly eye candy here, a very beautiful woman in her youth. Worth mentioning is the toddler who plays Dvorak's son, little Buster Phelps, who read his lines with conviction and the sweetest whine you ever heard. Also appearing are Warren William and Humphrey Bogart.Leonard Maltin adds commentary before the show about the Production Code and why this film is part of Forbidden Hollywood.",5,"Highly Entertaining, Twice as Shocking",1146096000,"04 27, 2006",2006,1639,"['Three', 'Match', 'superstition', 'begun', 'matchmaker', 'who', 'wanted', 'sell', 'more', 'matches', 'Supposedly', 'three', 'people', 'light', 'same', 'cigarette', 'one', 'match', 'third', 'do', 'so', 'will', 'die', 'story', 'schoolyard', 'where', 'three', 'girls', 'are', 'recess', 'mischievious', 'girl', 'who', 'bloomers', 'everyone', 'named', 'Mary', 'Joan', 'Blondell', 'prissy', 'popular', 'one', 'named', 'Vivien', 'Ann', 'Dvorak', 'smart', 'quite', 'one', 'named', 'Ruth', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'follow', 'different', 'paths', 'Mary', 'reform', 'school', 'then', 'actress', 'Vivien', 'married', 'adorable', 'little', 'boy', 'Ruth', 'business', 'school', 'then', 'work', 'three', 'meet', 'have', 'lunch', 'together', 'light', 'cigarettes', 'one', 'match', 'end', 'foreshadowed', 'fact', 'Vivien', 'lights', 'cigarette', 'last.The', 'events', 'follow', 'are', 'reason', 'why', 'movie', 'included', 'Forbidden', 'Hollywood', 'series', 'adultery', 'neglect', 'small', 'child', 'drug', 'use', 'organized', 'crime', 'fast', 'paced', 'short', 'thrilling', 'movie.Blondell', 'great', 'role', 'beautiful', 'witty', 'natural', 'Dvorak', 'not', 'fare', 'so', 'well', 'most', 'lines', 'sound', 'scripted', 'awkward', 'making', 'main', 'character', 'hard', 'believe', 'Davis', 'part', 'small', 'mostly', 'eye', 'candy', 'here', 'very', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'youth', 'Worth', 'mentioning', 'toddler', 'who', 'Dvorak', 'son', 'little', 'Buster', 'Phelps', 'who', 'read', 'lines', 'conviction', 'sweetest', 'whine', 'ever', 'heard', 'Also', 'appearing', 'are', 'Warren', 'William', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart.Leonard', 'Maltin', 'commentary', 'show', 'Production', 'Code', 'why', 'film', 'part', 'Forbidden', 'Hollywood']",Three on a Match VHS
293345,A3BSS2M2DPPV4T,6302041104,"""scotsladdie""","[3, 3]","A relatively little-seen Warner's programmer which has a biting sense of realism in its favour. Blondell, Dvorak & Davis play old school chums who meet for lunch after 1O years have passed. While they light up their Chesterfields, they laugh off the old superstition which says the third party lit - Dvorak - will be the first to die. Mary (Joan Blondell) has become a successful entertainer, Vivian (Ann Dvorak) has married successful lawyer Robert Kirkwood (Warren William) and Ruth Wescott (Bette Davis) is a prim & proper stenographer. Because she is quite frankly bored with her social position, Vivian takes up company with a handsome but immoral playboy gambler she's introduced to, one Michael Luftus. From there she's on the road to ""God knows where"" as she finds herself in the company of low-life drug addicts....Originally, the censor boards were reluctant to pass the kidnapping segment, fearing the public would find it in bad taste: this was made during the wake of the infamous Lindbergh kidnapping. Because the kidnappers were apprehended, the censors relented - on the East coast, anyway. As Ruth Westcott, Bette Davis is blonde and attractive, but her part is a very inconsequential one.
