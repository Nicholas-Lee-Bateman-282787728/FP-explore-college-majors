The townsfolk all seem to have the same bad teeth and large ears. After a run in, our heroes become the main attraction in a theater one might see in ""Blood Sucking Freaks"" complete with a bare bottomed organ player right out of Monty Python.The theater aspect, which was by far the highlight of the film, needed a third act. There was significant internal conflict within the teen group which served more as a distraction. Instead they should have used this as an opportunity to develop dark humor. The film is also sold as a comedy, but the humor was more in their outfits. The production certainly has the potential to achieve cult status as it has all the qualifications, but for me it fell short. Personally I prefer ""House of a 1,000 Corpses"" or ""10,000 Maniacs"" or ""Blood Sucking Freaks"" for this type of cult genre.Recommend as a strong cult rental.

1577835,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B008X6HSLC,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[12, 13]","This little scorcher of a film is set in Yorkshire. It is about four young offenders who are being taken on a weekend with two care workers to learn a bit about how others live. Jeff (James Doherty `In The Loop'), is the square one who wants rules and boundaries to keep the kids in check and Kate (Jo Hartley - `The Young Victoria') is the one who gets down with the homies type.Well they arrive at their destination which is a dilapidated ex farm type place and get down to lots of swearing, complaining and `attitude' especially Dwight, who is a real pain. As a reward for cleaning up the dump, they get taken to the local pub, `The Dirty Hole'. This is full of locals who are quite clearly dentist dodgers and the Landlord Jim doesn't do food but does do home made pork scratching - the hairy sort. Next day they sally forth to do some reclamation work at a train graveyard and soon the locals are on the scene and things get out of hand pretty quick.This is just excellent, I actually expected nothing, but this is like an extreme version of `The League of Gentleman', it says in the opening credits who designed `Blood and Gore Effects', so you pretty much know what was coming. But and there is a great big but here, they are incidental to the whole thing rather than being the raison d'tre . The humour is dark in a depraved way, the grotesquery of characters are all just brilliant and it is genuinely scary in a kind of freak you out way, rather than relying on sudden `frights'. We even have a house band at the pub and a full on banjo player, with a rather well penned ditty that gives some indication as to the welcome `outsiders' will receive. Add to this the fact that the characters all get a chance to shine and you have close to a perfect horror flick. There are some strong regional accents that I know some people find hard to understand, but trust me as a Brit, these are spot on.This is not for the squeamish; there is blood, gore, torture and some jaw droppingly ugly freaks here. Co writer and director Alex Chandon has made an original, highly entertaining and darkly comic tale and its based in Yorkshire - what is not to like? A special mention goes to Seamus O Neil (War Horse) who plays Jim and steals every scene he is in; he alone gets the full five stars, this was the most entertaining film I have seen in ages and can not recommend highly enough, don't eat your tea whilst watching and if you like pork scratchings, this will put you off them for life.",5,"""They Won't Leave, they Never Do""",1352160000,"11 6, 2012",2012,2486,"['little', 'scorcher', 'film', 'set', 'Yorkshire', 'four', 'young', 'offenders', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'taken', 'weekend', 'two', 'care', 'workers', 'learn', 'bit', 'how', 'others', 'live', 'Jeff', 'James', 'Doherty', 'Loop', 'square', 'one', 'who', 'rules', 'boundaries', 'keep', 'kids', 'check', 'Kate', 'Jo', 'Hartley', 'Young', 'Victoria', 'one', 'who', 'down', 'homies', 'type.Well', 'arrive', 'destination', 'dilapidated', 'ex', 'farm', 'type', 'place', 'get', 'down', 'lots', 'swearing', 'complaining', 'attitude', 'especially', 'Dwight', 'who', 'real', 'pain', 'reward', 'cleaning', 'up', 'dump', 'get', 'taken', 'local', 'pub', 'Dirty', 'Hole', 'full', 'locals', 'who', 'are', 'quite', 'clearly', 'dentist', 'dodgers', 'Landlord', 'Jim', ""n't"", 'do', 'food', 'do', 'home', 'made', 'pork', 'scratching', 'hairy', 'sort', 'Next', 'day', 'sally', 'forth', 'do', 'reclamation', 'work', 'train', 'graveyard', 'soon', 'locals', 'are', 'scene', 'things', 'get', 'hand', 'pretty', 'quick.This', 'just', 'excellent', 'actually', 'expected', 'nothing', 'extreme', 'version', 'League', 'Gentleman', 'opening', 'credits', 'who', 'designed', 'Blood', 'Gore', 'Effects', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'great', 'big', 'here', 'are', 'incidental', 'whole', 'thing', 'rather', 'being', 'raison', ""d'tre"", 'humour', 'dark', 'depraved', 'way', 'grotesquery', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'brilliant', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'kind', 'freak', 'out', 'way', 'rather', 'relying', 'sudden', 'frights', 'even', 'have', 'house', 'band', 'pub', 'full', 'banjo', 'player', 'rather', 'well', 'penned', 'ditty', 'indication', 'welcome', 'outsiders', 'will', 'receive', 'Add', 'fact', 'characters', 'get', 'chance', 'shine', 'have', 'close', 'perfect', 'horror', 'flick', 'are', 'strong', 'regional', 'accents', 'know', 'people', 'find', 'hard', 'understand', 'trust', 'Brit', 'are', 'spot', 'on.This', 'not', 'squeamish', 'blood', 'gore', 'torture', 'jaw', 'droppingly', 'ugly', 'here', 'Co', 'writer', 'director', 'Alex', 'Chandon', 'made', 'original', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'darkly', 'comic', 'tale', 'based', 'Yorkshire', 'what', 'not', 'like', 'special', 'mention', 'Seamus', 'O', 'Neil', 'War', 'Horse', 'who', 'Jim', 'steals', 'scene', 'alone', 'full', 'five', 'stars', 'was', 'most', 'entertaining', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'ages', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'highly', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'eat', 'tea', 'whilst', 'watching', 'like', 'pork', 'scratchings', 'will', 'put', 'off', 'life']",Inbred 2011  In bred  NON-USA FORMAT Reg.B United Kingdom
