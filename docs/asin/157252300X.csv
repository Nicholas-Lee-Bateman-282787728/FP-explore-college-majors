186996,A3N7QVBNKU5S2M,157252300X,J. Brackett,"[0, 0]","A shepherd pulls his young son out of the first grade to start him on his career as a shepherd. He teaches him necessary survival skills for the job, but beats him for attempting to abandon his duties. The boy reaches his twenty-first year. The father sells almost everything and buys an olive grove which a frost destroys. The young shepherd and his peers plan to immigrate to Germany, but he is sent back while the others leave because his father didn't sign the correct forms and because he is illiterate. The young man gets a grammar school equivalency diploma and joins the army. He makes a friend who helps him to refine his intellect. He learns quickly and decides he wants to continue to University for linguistics. Returning home he is forced to work for his father during the day and study by night. He fails an exam and refuses to work anymore. The father and son have a fight, and the son has to leave. He gets his doctorate and writes an award-winning autobiography. He returns to his hometown to live.The theme of this film is the wisdom that allows an uneducated, young shepherd to gain an education, fame, and an independent, meaningful existence in the context of patriarchal oppression.This theme is enhanced by the use of the elements of film style. Editing shows us a sequence in which the face of a patron saint that the boys are carrying in procession turn into the face of Gavino's father. This shows the audience that, metaphorically, Gavino carries the weight of his father on his shoulders. We feel the heavy patriarchal oppression to which he and his peers are subjected. Action shows us Gavino turning the radio volume up when his father asks him to turn it off, and then humming Mozart's clarinet concerto when his father silences the radio by immersing it in water. The audience recognizes that Gavino is finally defying his patronizing father. This action also shows us the dimension of his mind, as it reveals that he is capable of understanding Mozart and of keeping beauty alive in his life. We fear retribution and are at the same time awed by and proud of Gavino's courage. Sound gives us many stream-of-consciousness sequences in which we hear the thoughts of Gavino and other characters. In one such sequence, we hear Gavino connecting the vocabulary he is memorizing to words that he already knows and to feelings he has known but could not name before. ""...Languid, lurid, father, fatherly, patriarch, patronize,"" he says to himself. This allows the audience into Gavino's consciousness, so that we experience growth; we recognize that as he learns new vocabulary, he is also acquiring self-worth.This film story is culturally valuable because it shows that one man can acquire the wisdom to break the traditional cycle that many--perhaps centuries of--people had not. It is a story, therefore, that is greatly inspirational to anyone who has ever faced opposition to maturation, modernization or creativity. The use of detailed sounds and slow, simple camera movements force the audience's senses to follow Gavino's. When he is alone in the dark, we are alone in the dark. We see a close-up of a snake's poised, open jaw and fear it, just as he does. We hear the wind through the trees as Gavino's father trains him to recognize his location by it. Likewise, the many stream of consciousness scenes allow the audience into Gavino's mind. We also hear fragments of the thoughts of the schoolchildren, Gavino's father, the selfish townspeople at a funeral, and even the sheep Gavino milks. The use of such devices makes the audience take part not only in the physical pain and alienation that was part of a young shepherd's life, but also in the mental neglect and torture that followed. We feel abandoned, fed up, and triumphant as Gavino does. The most important aspect of this film, however, lies in the fact that while Gavino creates his own boundaries and frees himself from patriarchal slavery, he is still self-aware and doesn't turn his story into a fairy tale. He is not living in a mansion with a perfect wife and children at the film's end. Rather, the real Gavino is presented to the audience on the same lonely streets on which he began, looking content but imperfect. This story allows for the fact that there are still sad aspects to his life, and lingering effects to what he experienced. Likewise, none of his experience was sweetened: his life is presented as was, in a beautiful and moving way.",5,The Unsweetened Life of a Shepherd,1178323200,"05 5, 2007",2007,4452,"['shepherd', 'young', 'son', 'first', 'grade', 'start', 'career', 'shepherd', 'necessary', 'survival', 'skills', 'job', 'attempting', 'abandon', 'duties', 'boy', 'twenty-first', 'year', 'father', 'almost', 'everything', 'olive', 'grove', 'frost', 'destroys', 'young', 'shepherd', 'peers', 'plan', 'immigrate', 'Germany', 'sent', 'back', 'others', 'leave', 'father', 'did', ""n't"", 'sign', 'correct', 'forms', 'illiterate', 'young', 'man', 'grammar', 'school', 'equivalency', 'diploma', 'army', 'friend', 'who', 'refine', 'intellect', 'quickly', 'continue', 'University', 'linguistics', 'Returning', 'home', 'forced', 'work', 'father', 'day', 'study', 'night', 'exam', 'work', 'anymore', 'father', 'son', 'have', 'fight', 'son', 'leave', 'doctorate', 'award-winning', 'autobiography', 'hometown', 'live.The', 'theme', 'film', 'wisdom', 'uneducated', 'young', 'shepherd', 'gain', 'education', 'fame', 'independent', 'meaningful', 'existence', 'context', 'patriarchal', 'oppression.This', 'theme', 'enhanced', 'use', 'elements', 'film', 'style', 'Editing', 'sequence', 'face', 'patron', 'saint', 'boys', 'are', 'carrying', 'procession', 'turn', 'face', 'Gavino', 'father', 'audience', 'metaphorically', 'Gavino', 'weight', 'father', 'shoulders', 'feel', 'heavy', 'patriarchal', 'oppression', 'peers', 'are', 'subjected', 'Action', 'Gavino', 'turning', 'radio', 'volume', 'up', 'when', 'father', 'turn', 'off', 'then', 'humming', 'Mozart', 'clarinet', 'concerto', 'when', 'father', 'radio', 'immersing', 'water', 'audience', 'Gavino', 'finally', 'defying', 'patronizing', 'father', 'action', 'also', 'dimension', 'mind', 'capable', 'understanding', 'Mozart', 'keeping', 'beauty', 'alive', 'life', 'fear', 'retribution', 'are', 'same', 'time', 'awed', 'proud', 'Gavino', 'courage', 'Sound', 'many', 'stream-of-consciousness', 'sequences', 'hear', 'thoughts', 'Gavino', 'other', 'characters', 'one', 'such', 'sequence', 'hear', 'Gavino', 'connecting', 'vocabulary', 'memorizing', 'words', 'already', 'feelings', 'known', 'could', 'not', 'name', 'Languid', 'lurid', 'father', 'fatherly', 'patriarch', 'patronize', 'audience', 'Gavino', 'consciousness', 'experience', 'growth', 'recognize', 'new', 'vocabulary', 'also', 'acquiring', 'self-worth.This', 'film', 'story', 'culturally', 'valuable', 'one', 'man', 'can', 'acquire', 'wisdom', 'break', 'traditional', 'cycle', 'many', 'perhaps', 'centuries', 'people', 'had', 'not', 'story', 'therefore', 'greatly', 'inspirational', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'faced', 'opposition', 'maturation', 'modernization', 'creativity', 'use', 'detailed', 'sounds', 'slow', 'simple', 'camera', 'movements', 'force', 'audience', 'senses', 'follow', 'Gavino', 'When', 'alone', 'dark', 'are', 'alone', 'dark', 'see', 'close-up', 'snake', 'poised', 'open', 'jaw', 'fear', 'just', 'hear', 'wind', 'trees', 'Gavino', 'father', 'recognize', 'location', 'Likewise', 'many', 'stream', 'consciousness', 'scenes', 'allow', 'audience', 'Gavino', 'mind', 'also', 'hear', 'fragments', 'thoughts', 'schoolchildren', 'Gavino', 'father', 'selfish', 'townspeople', 'funeral', 'even', 'sheep', 'Gavino', 'milks', 'use', 'such', 'devices', 'audience', 'take', 'part', 'not', 'only', 'physical', 'pain', 'alienation', 'was', 'part', 'young', 'shepherd', 'life', 'also', 'mental', 'neglect', 'torture', 'followed', 'feel', 'abandoned', 'fed', 'up', 'triumphant', 'Gavino', 'most', 'important', 'aspect', 'film', 'however', 'fact', 'Gavino', 'own', 'boundaries', 'frees', 'patriarchal', 'slavery', 'still', 'self-aware', ""n't"", 'turn', 'story', 'fairy', 'tale', 'not', 'living', 'mansion', 'perfect', 'wife', 'children', 'film', 'end', 'real', 'Gavino', 'presented', 'audience', 'same', 'lonely', 'streets', 'began', 'looking', 'content', 'imperfect', 'story', 'fact', 'are', 'still', 'sad', 'aspects', 'life', 'lingering', 'effects', 'what', 'experienced', 'Likewise', 'none', 'experience', 'was', 'sweetened', 'life', 'presented', 'was', 'beautiful', 'moving', 'way']",N/A

186998,A220FJEQNGMSRN,157252300X,Trevor Willsmer,"[5, 5]","There's no shortage of grit and unpleasantness in Padre Padrone, the kind of film you really couldn't make today - violent child beatings, animals beaten, killed or worse on screen (I really wasn't expecting the montage of donkey and chicken molesting) and a distinct lack of any sentimentality. But the Taviani Brothers' film is still one of the best I've seen this year, turning what could easily have been an exercise in miserablism into a remarkable and occasionally anarchic but always imaginative piece of pure filmmaking. From its great opening, where the real Gavino hands the actor playing his father the stick he will use to beat him as a child, there's an intelligent audacity that manifests itself in a world where animals and even music have voices if you know how to listen: the battle of wills between Gavino and a goat played out in voice over, or the voice overs of the school children whose laughter at Gavino's fate turns to horror as they realize they are next are just two great examples. Some shots manage to be strangely beautiful in spite of their context or even, odd as it sounds, their visual quality - the tracking shot of leaving the village, the long take of the father hurrying home to kill his son. The film also has a superlative use of sound, creating a sense of place out of the sounds as much of the sights in Gavino's first night in the pasture.The two hours fly by, but burn themelves into your memory.

186999,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,157252300X,Turfseer,"[3, 4]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'Padre Padrone' is based on noted linguist Gavino Ledda's autobiography which came out in 1975. The distinguished directors, the Taviani brothers, brought the story to the screen two years later. Ledda chronicles his childhood, adolescence and young adulthood, growing up under the yoke of his tyrannical father, a sheep herder from Sardinia.'Padre Pardone' opens with a cameo from the real-life Gavino introducing the story directly to the audience. He brings us back to the time when he was in elementary school, when his father suddenly appeared one day and pulled him out of class for good. The father brings him to an isolated area in Sardinia with the intent of molding the very young child into a sheep herder. The child is forced to watch the property in an isolated area, Baddevr&ugrave;stana, while his father is off tending to business in Siligo, a provincial town close by. Since the only means of travel is by mule, Gavino finds himself alone on inhospitable turf.Gavino tries to make contact with other children who are forced to work for their fathers in the same way and he ends up being punished for it. The corporal punishment includes beatings with spiny tree branches which is mentioned in the autobiography. In the film it's not as clear, as we see the beatings with the branches from a distance. We do see a scene in the film where the father goes a little too far, where it appears Gavino loses consciousness for a short while (the father brings the son a cup of water to revive him).In another memorable scene, Gavino buys a broken accordion from two passersby and pays them with two sheep. Gavino lies to his father that he was attacked by bandits who stole the sheep. He shows his father his (self-inflicted) cut on the mouth but the father doesn't buy his story and cuts his rations.Due to the isolation of the male children as their fathers force them to work the entire time tending to the sheep, they have little or no contact with the opposite sex and develop some rather unhealthy sexual proclivities. A few scenes of bestiality are prominent during the first third of the film, including Gavino getting it on a with a mule and a group of boys masturbating with the aid of chickens they're attending to inside a coop.Once Gavino grows up, we meet him next when he's twenty. Gavino's father somehow inherits an olive grove under dubious circumstances. After a landowner is killed by a rival, Gavino's family helps the widow with the funeral arrangements and disposing of the property. The widow, in fear for her life, decides to move away from the area, but gives Gavino's father the olive grove as compensation for their help. Gavino's father plans to cede the grove to his offspring following his death but a frost destroys all the orchards in the area, including the family's olive grove.Gavino's father then decides to sell his herd and all this property, except for a garden. The children are shipped off as laborers but the father ships Gavino off to the Army. Before he leaves, the father teaches him some rudimentary math and reading so he can be accepted into the Army, as they will not accept someone who is completely illiterate.While in the Army, with the help of a friend, Gavino eventually learns how to read and write. He also completes a course in electronics and learns how to assemble a radio. When his enlistment period is over, against his father's wishes, he quits the army and decides to enroll at the University of Sardinia to study linguistics. Gavino's father forces him to work long hours in the garden which interferes with his studies and eventually the two have a physical confrontation. Now much stronger than his father, Gavino wrestles him down to the ground and humiliates the old man. Gavino concludes it's best that he leave his father's home and then goes off to the university to later become a distinguished professor of linguistics.It should be noted that the Taviani brothers are not out to condemn the brutality of the patriarchal society they're examining. While Gavino's father is sometimes brutal, in his eyes, he still has Gavino's best interests at heart. A good deal of the father's behavior toward his son is more 'tough love' than continuing acts of sadism. In many ways, he's ambivalent toward Gavino. In a most telling scene at the end, Gavino is looking for his valise under his father's bed, who's sitting right there after being humiliated after their wrestling match. As Gavino looks under the bed, the father is about to gently stroke his son's head but then clenches his fist, as if to strike him. In the denouement, we see that there were no further physical confrontations.Not everything in 'Padre Padrone' works. Most notably, none of the other family members are developed as fleshed-out characters. The sound quality of the film is also quite poor, as if we were listening to dialogue dubbed in the studio. Questionable experimental techniques are also utilized including animal and child voice-overs and sub-titles that seem to come out of the blue.'Padre Padrone' is comprised of a series of interesting vignettes about a world most of us are not familiar with. While the father may seem a bit one-note, the intensity between father and son is absorbing. 'Padre Padrone' can sometimes be infuriatingly slow-moving but one finds oneself waiting to find out how the relationship between the father and son is resolved. I'm not sure if this film is a true 'classic', but it's worth a look at least once, if not twice.",3,Slow-moving but absorbing chronicle of conflict between father-son Sardinian
