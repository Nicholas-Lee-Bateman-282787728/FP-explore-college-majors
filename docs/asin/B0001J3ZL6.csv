They were contemporaries of The Beach Boys. They sang of the fun from fast cars and surfing on the beach (a pastime allowed to few young men). Their career ended when one of them had a car crash that resulted in brain damage. The Beach Boys sang of racing cars, Jan & Dean gave a warning about ""Deadman's Curve"" (a little-used stretch of Mulholland Drive). Their songs were similar to advertising to sell cars (""Little GTO"" by another group). There was nothing to make listeners think of outside events (""controversial"" like ""The Eve of Destruction"")These seemingly happy days ended for many young men with a draft notice. Stay in college, get married and have a child, or work in a defense industry were the alternatives. Some joined the Army and were sent to Germany. Were mostly young men from the big cities sent to Vietnam? If drafted, Jan & Dean could have spent their time entertaining the troops (like Jackie Cooper).

Richard Hatch was mis-cast as Jan Berry. Film was otherwise very well done. Jan Berry was a genius. I believe he was a member of the MENSA society.  Jan should be admired for the way he fought back and was able to move on with his life & career despite being so disabled.,5,Need to be on DVD,1238457600,"03 31, 2009",2009,386,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', 'HBO', '1979', 'have', 'loved', 'ever', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'so', 'rare', 'not', 'DVD', 'Richard', 'Hatch', 'was', 'mis-cast', 'Jan', 'Berry', 'Film', 'was', 'otherwise', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Jan', 'Berry', 'was', 'genius', 'believe', 'was', 'member', 'MENSA', 'society', 'Jan', 'should', 'be', 'admired', 'way', 'fought', 'back', 'was', 'able', 'move', 'life', 'career', 'being', 'so', 'disabled']",Deadman's Curve: The Jan and Dean Story
