967192,A2BDQQ39DJ826Y,B000E33VZO,viewer,"[12, 18]","When I stumbled across the original summer 2002 airing of She Spies, flipping past NBC on, I believe, an early Saturday night, I thought it was some of the freshest, most inspired silliness, with some of the brightest, most attractive personalities, I had seen on TV.  I instantly fell in love with the series, and followed it through its confusing move to syndication and late night and its second season transformation.  By the time it was cancelled, it had not lost all of its wit and charm, the actors were still doing a good job with what they had, and I was sad to see it go.  But the show never lived up to its promise.  And by the end, it was often tedious, forced, cliche, and melodramatic.  Some comparisons that come to mind are Sledge Hammer!, another off-the-wall series that did not know what do with itself and was cancelled after only two seasons; and The A-Team, which deteriorated so badly in its later episodes and was also radically changed to ""more serious"" for its last season.Almost right after the first She Spies episode, the quality became uneven, never really matching the opener.  Techniques like freeze-screen written asides to the viewer pretty much disappeared after the third episode.  The 2nd, 4th, and 5th shows were okay, the 3rd mediocre.  The show entered a real slump with episodes 6 to 10.  The series rebounded somewhat with shows 9, 13-15, 18, and 19.  But story lines seemed thinner and thinner.  This was most obvious with shows 8 and 10 (the spies trapped in their home or office by bombs or poison), 16, and 18, all of which resorted to tired, extensive use of ""flashbacks"" (often to nothing more than scenes from earlier shows) to pad a weak, ""new"" story.  No matter how hard you rooted for the show, you often got the sinking feeling as the episode went on that there was not enough story to sustain an hour show and that it was floundering.  The ""Bartum"" episode in which D.D. appears to be a ""traitor,"" and the Cassie kidnap episode are good examples, where the show is not very strong to begin with and then the story completely gives out during the drawn-out last 15 minutes.  Other episodes, like ""Damsels in De-Stress,"" 18, have some fun individual scenes (Cassie and masseuse Margo, D.D. and the herbalist) but they are constantly interrupted by over-done, poor ones (Jack's long-winded speeches to a psychiatrist incut with recycled scenes from earlier shows).By episodes 5 and 6, characters and situations were sometimes becoming so exaggerated that it hurt any intelligible story line or basic credibility -- necessary to hold together even a show like this.  Balance is necessary, and sometimes it was way off.  This was especially damaging when it afflicted the main characters, as with Cassie breaking into a musical number in the midst of a job interview with a tough in 6, and the labored ""who's on first"" routines at the wedding in 9 and by D.D. on the airplane in 19.  But it seemed to strike Jack the worst.Jack's quirky combination of down-to-business knowledgeability and strictness, sarcastic wit, desire to be cool, and prat-falling were original, effective, and hilarious when done well.  They often were (as in shows 1, 2, 5, 13, 14, 15, and in show 6 explaining to the spies, as they doubted the meaning of their work, that they had saved an agent with a family, in show 12 as a foil to a hilarious Cassie impersonation, and in 18 cutting off their banter with a line about ""turning to subjects worthy of our short time on earth"").  The ""La Puma"" episode was ingenious in its use of hypnosis to do fun things with the character without undermining it (the fight scene at the end is also hilarious).But a little bit of Jack could sometimes go too long a way, as in shows 10, 16, and 18 (labored, ham-handed blabbering scenes with two female doctors and a prison inmate).  And the series abused the character by going to uncomfortable extremes of incompetence and inconsistency, as in shows 9 (where he recounts having a wild, disastrous, and utterly unprofessional affair with a now-hardened then-trainee, complete with a line about ""buttering up the boss took on a whole new meaning""), 13 (where he is presented as a shy, meek suitor of a girl-next-door cafeteria cashier), 18 (where he is presented as pathologically protective of his team due to a childhood trauma of losing pet earthworm ""Wiggles""), 19 (where, reduced to a useless, retching distraction on a plane, he asks D.D. to delete the ""fake-name"" ""Alyssa Milano -- complete schedule and whereabouts"" file of ""tax records"" on his home computer and ignore word of a ""restraining order""), and 20 (where he is so busy behaving like a high school nerd attracted to D.D. and telling and screeching at dumb jokes that he blows his cover as a customer supposedly interested in the suspect's services).  The show created a great character, who was both comic and competent in his place.  But rather than be true to the character and content to use it to best advantage, the show too often either went way over the top with it or seemed at times to feel the need to push toward a romantic, action-hero figure, which did not work at all.At the same time, the first season sometimes (as in shows 4, 12, 20) showed a tendency that would become overbearing in the second season:  injecting an uncomfortable mix of tear-jerking sentimentalism (for example, about the women's backgrounds) into the supposedly light-weight, upbeat program.  By the end of the first season, the show looked like it was running out of gas and unsure where it was going (the direction it was apparently heading in episode 20 of having Jack and D.D. become romantically involved seemed unstable and wrongheaded as a plot device).  I feared changes were in the offing (as with The A-Team's sad last season).Sure enough, the show was radically changed.  It tossed out one of its most interesting, vital characters in Jack, the comfortable, informal home and office sets, and a lot of the irreverent, silly tone and touches that had made the show original and a pleasure to watch (right down to the cute episode titles that ceased being displayed with season 2).  Replacing these were stiff, cardboard cut-out ""strong, handsome, silent type"" boss ""Quentin Cross,"" even stiffer and less effective guest appearances by Bruce Boxleitner as the agency head, cliche goofy gadget geek ""Duncan,"" and new character-less, stamped-out beach house home and concrete-and-glass office.  The new elements were not terribly handled, were more believable and maybe even necessary if the spy agency premise were to be taken more seriously, but they were not special or interesting.  Nor were injected dynamics between the characters in the form of tension/attraction between Cross and Cassie and Duncan's puppydog crush on D.D.There seemed to be more plotting to the stories and situations than in the first season.  But many second season episodes seemed predictable, tedious, and recyled from other shows (Shane ""gone bad""; agency head ""murdered""; defector's daughter; kidnapped gymnast; abducted princess; island castaways).  The plot device of the spy who falls in love with, or loses to a murderous foe, his/her partner was used and overused time and again.  Some episodes were so irretrievably dreary, grim, and maudlin that they were unpleasant to watch (Cassie finding her missing mother who had been kidnapped decades earlier and brainwashed to become a spy for the Far East; bomb locked on Cassie; Shane poisoned).  Just enough humor and banter remained to preserve some continuity and interest in the series, and the cast made a valiant effort.  There were some decent second season episodes (like the psychic (""Bam!""); Cassie's double; protecting a groom; protecting a witness and his ill-behaved son; Cassie and Cross undercover at couples workshop while D.D.'s mom visits; gunmen taking over reality show).Some reviews offer nothing more than a few words or lines of vague, gushing reaction, or some sloppy comparisons, like to Charlie's Angels, or they seem to take offense at recognizing any faults in a favorite show.  That kind of review says almost nothing useful.  It not only skims over the surface of what makes the show enjoyable to watch but also ignores the nagging problems that keep getting in the way of fuller enjoyment of it, the first time around or when returning to it.All in all, precisely because She Spies could be so good at times, it's sad that the many talented people involved with this show were not able, even in the first season, to make a real, consistent go of it.  And it's sad that all that's left in the end are a few dozen very uneven shows salted with occasional true inspiration.",3,Inspired But Uneven And Unable To Sustain Itself,1145577600,"04 21,

967193,A3BDB0FRY2WIOO,B000E33VZO,William Spears,"[5, 6]","In format, She Spies is reminiscent of Charlie's Angels. Three beautiful women are led by a slightly nerdy, romantically harmless, male through weekly adventures. But the similarities end with the structure.She Spies attempts to be a satirical and clever send-up to a whole host of TV action show cliches, and it often succeeds in its humor. The action itself tends to be played pretty straight. It is in the banter and observations between the women spies, their verbal exchanges with the villains, and the women's running battle with their ""Bosley"" leader, Carlos Jannott, where the humor and the satire come out.You expect Natasha Henstridge to be beautiful to watch and to have ""attitude""--she typically plays that type of role in her movies. If you like her in her movies, you will like her here.Natasha Williams, plays the black female operative who is tough and proud. Her character is fairly undeveloped, but nonetheless has her fair share of witty dialogue.But it is Kristen Miller, as the third woman of the trio who truly shines, and makes the show a cut above what you expect to find. She is cute, smart, sassy, and a little ditsy--if that sounds like a contradiction, that is because it is, and that is what makes her character so much fun to watch.Carlos Jannott is excellent as the women's boss, with equal doses of wit and goofiness, to make his contribution to the show memorable.All and all, She Spies is great combination of ""eye candy"" and wit.",4,A Great Combination of Eye Candy and Wit.,1144195200,"04 5, 2006",2006,1464,"['format', 'Spies', 'reminiscent', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'Three', 'beautiful', 'women', 'are', 'led', 'slightly', 'nerdy', 'romantically', 'harmless', 'male', 'weekly', 'adventures', 'similarities', 'end', 'structure.She', 'attempts', 'be', 'satirical', 'clever', 'send-up', 'whole', 'host', 'TV', 'action', 'show', 'cliches', 'often', 'humor', 'action', 'be', 'played', 'pretty', 'straight', 'banter', 'observations', 'women', 'spies', 'verbal', 'exchanges', 'villains', 'women', 'running', 'battle', 'Bosley', 'leader', 'Carlos', 'Jannott', 'where', 'humor', 'satire', 'come', 'out.You', 'expect', 'Natasha', 'Henstridge', 'be', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'have', 'attitude', 'typically', 'type', 'role', 'movies', 'like', 'movies', 'will', 'like', 'here.Natasha', 'Williams', 'black', 'female', 'operative', 'who', 'tough', 'proud', 'character', 'fairly', 'undeveloped', 'nonetheless', 'fair', 'share', 'witty', 'dialogue.But', 'Kristen', 'Miller', 'third', 'woman', 'trio', 'who', 'truly', 'shines', 'show', 'cut', 'what', 'expect', 'find', 'cute', 'smart', 'sassy', 'little', 'ditsy', 'contradiction', 'what', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch.Carlos', 'Jannott', 'excellent', 'women', 'boss', 'equal', 'doses', 'wit', 'goofiness', 'make', 'contribution', 'show', 'memorable.All', 'Spies', 'great', 'combination', 'eye', 'candy', 'wit']",She Spies - The Complete First Season
