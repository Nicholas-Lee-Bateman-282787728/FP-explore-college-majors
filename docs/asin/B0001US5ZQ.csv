And the challenges they meet head on. Any movie or TV show with Ernest Borgnine is bound to be very good.,5,Good Family Film,1401840000,"06 4, 2014",2014,249,"['Great', 'movie', 'how', 'determined', 'couple', 'teens', 'look', 'lost', 'treasure', 'beat', 'odds', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'roadblocks', 'may', 'be', 'put', 'way', 'challenges', 'meet', 'head', 'Any', 'movie', 'TV', 'show', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'bound', 'be', 'very', 'good']",The Lost Treasure of Sawtooth Island

On that note, I would still give it at least 4 stars.  I haven't watched a family oriented film since ""Finding Nemo"", and this one was indeed a charmer.  Ernest Borgnine with an all-new up and coming cast set the stage for a fun-filled adventure out at sea.  No cursing, no sex, maybe some light violence (we are talking lost treasures and pirates here), but nothing even I couldn't handle (and I get squeamish watching ER).  Truly a delightful film, well acted, well produced, and a high quality DVD - complete with plenty of bonus features.  If you are looking for an alternative to the big studio releases, and something viewable by adults and children, then The Lost Treasure of Sawtooth Island is indeed a wonderful choice!  Plenty of humor to enjoy as well.",5,Nice to see a G rated movie in an R rated world....,1105315200,"01 10, 2005",2005,893,"['purchased', 'movie', 'had', 'opportunity', '2003', 'meet', 'one', 'actors', 'Logan', 'Lipton', 'review', 'may', 'be', 'bias', 'note', 'would', 'still', 'give', 'least', '4', 'stars', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'family', 'oriented', 'film', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'one', 'was', 'indeed', 'charmer', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'all-new', 'up', 'coming', 'cast', 'set', 'stage', 'fun-filled', 'adventure', 'out', 'sea', 'cursing', 'sex', 'maybe', 'light', 'violence', 'are', 'talking', 'lost', 'treasures', 'pirates', 'here', 'nothing', 'even', 'could', ""n't"", 'handle', 'get', 'squeamish', 'watching', 'ER', 'Truly', 'delightful', 'film', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'produced', 'high', 'quality', 'DVD', 'complete', 'plenty', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'looking', 'alternative', 'big', 'studio', 'releases', 'something', 'viewable', 'adults', 'children', 'then', 'Lost', 'Treasure', 'Sawtooth', 'Island', 'indeed', 'wonderful', 'choice', 'Plenty', 'humor', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well']",The Lost Treasure of Sawtooth Island
