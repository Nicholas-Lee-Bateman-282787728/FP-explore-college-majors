Both of the women are  equally clueless about the fact that they are a gay couple, and constantly invite along a single woman for Brian to meet.  When Dennis and Brian break up, Brian shows up for dinner alone, explaining his ""roommate"" found his own place, and is further upset when that evening's female guest figures him out in a matter of minutes. Mae and Rose overhear her remark that Brian is gay, and, after some soul searching, they decide to find a new boyfriend for him.  They go to a local gay bar, and talk a go-go boy into coming for Sunday dinner.  When Brian brings along a guest they were not expecting, luckily Mae and Rose have other guests who come to the rescue.This is a madcap, over-the-top comedy, kind of in the same vein as ""Sordid Lives,"" complete with Southern accents that come and go. There are liberal doses of camp and stereotypes, drag queens, internet hook-up sites, ageist twinks, leather people, bible thumping, an ex-gay conversion center (complete with shock therapy), and an overall implausible premise that you want to believe anyway, because it is just so darned much fun.  Positive depictions of gay youth, and lessons to parents who don't accept their gay or lesbian children, are valuable parts of the story.  Written/directed and produced by Keith Hartman, best known for several (equally ""over-the-top"") gay novels, on a tiny budget that he put to excellent use (Many of the extras in the bar scene are actually crew members.)  Unrated, but would be PG for light sexual content. DVD extras listed include commentaries by Hartman (which doesn't work on my retail DVD) or by the actresses who played the two women, a go-go boy video, deleted scene, trailer and cast/crew profiles.

The parts that start to bring the drag queens and muscle-leather couple and the young 16 yr old gay neighbor kid together start to feel even more like Spanish Golden Age Theater or Oscar Wilde style of surprise-shock of unexpected conversations and interactions.The end of the movie was tender, showing the total love and support the mother has always had, and the dreams she has for his happiness.

1432318,A3PPSZB0W5DZH6,B004XKUFY4,"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[7, 8]","Director/writer Keith Hartman's charming comedy, about a mother's unconditional love for her gay son, quickly became an award-winning favorite at several gay film festivals. And it's easy to see why.At first, Southern mama Mae (Joanne McGee) is horrified to learn that her beloved only son Brian (Stewart Carrico) is ""you know""...gay. Mae and Brian haven't been communicating at all. Despite the fact that he's had a five year relationship with his ""room-mate"" Dennis (Brett Holland) , Brian can't bear to tell her he's gay, for fear she'll need CPR. And if he can't tell her he's gay, he can't tell her he is heartbroken after Dennis leaves him. Mae learns the truth after her spinster sister Rose (Carol Goans) completes a gay quiz in ""Glamour""  magazine. After some over-the-top wailing (""I should never have let Brian watch ""The Wizard Of Oz""...it has Judy Garland"") and a visit to an ""ex-gay"" church program, Mae and Rose decide they love Brian just the way he is. From then on, they are women on a mission...to find Brian Mr. Right.It is hard to believe that Mae and Rose are as clueless as they initially are... not only about Brian, but about everything! These women have never heard of the Internet. And they haven't been downtown in twenty years. Yet, the scenes of Rose and Mae's first day on the Internet and first night of ""man-hunting"" at a gay bar are absolutely hilarious. Rose takes a wrong turn at the gay bar and drag-queen Salsa (Matt Palazzolo) exclaims ""Oh Grandma, ""The Sound Of Music"" look is so over!"", just before giving her a mini-makeover.In this breezy 85 minute movie, the characters undergo some drastic and hasty behavioral changes. The movie itself also makes a rather dizzy transition from funny comedy to full-on farce in the vein of ""Auntie Mame.""  But, on the whole, the overall movie works. McGee and Goans give especially endearing performances. It also doesn't hurt that Stewart Carrico is gorgeous and easy on the eyes. The equally dreamy Steve Snyder plays Chase, the guy you  WISH Brian will get a clue about and hurry up and hook up with. The diverting ensemble cast also includes Ginger Pullman, Acquah Dansoh, Chris Nolan and Leif Holt.Keith Hartman's strength as a director/writer is that he goes for honest laughs instead of cheap ones. The humor is never at the expense of the characters. We laugh with the characters, but never at them. Hartman knows there must be humanity underneath farce in order for farce to work. The most touching moment occurs late in the film when Mae tells Brian, ""I want you to be happy... and if you're not happy in this world, I will change the world. But I will not have the world change you!"" That is the kind of unconditional,  loving response every gay and lesbian individual hopes to receive from their parents, friends, loved ones, etc., but seldom do. ""My Son"" presents the world as it should be, instead of how it is.  In this case, a farce-fantasy  is not a bad thing at all. The film offers hope and, with its head and heart in exactly the right place, is especially heartwarming.",4,"""I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY""",1309132800,"06 27, 2011",2011,3069,"['Director/writer', 'Keith', 'Hartman', 'charming', 'comedy', 'mother', 'unconditional', 'love', 'gay', 'son', 'quickly', 'became', 'award-winning', 'favorite', 'several', 'gay', 'film', 'festivals', 'easy', 'see', 'why.At', 'first', 'Southern', 'mama', 'Mae', 'Joanne', 'McGee', 'horrified', 'learn', 'beloved', 'only', 'son', 'Brian', 'Stewart', 'Carrico', 'know', 'gay', 'Mae', 'Brian', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'communicating', 'fact', 'had', 'five', 'year', 'relationship', 'room-mate', 'Dennis', 'Brett', 'Holland', 'Brian', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'tell', 'gay', 'fear', ""'ll"", 'need', 'CPR', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'gay', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'heartbroken', 'Dennis', 'Mae', 'truth', 'spinster', 'sister', 'Rose', 'Carol', 'Goans', 'gay', 'quiz', 'Glamour', 'magazine', 'over-the-top', 'wailing', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'let', 'Brian', 'watch', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'visit', 'ex-gay', 'church', 'program', 'Mae', 'Rose', 'decide', 'love', 'Brian', 'just', 'way', 'then', 'are', 'women', 'mission', 'find', 'Brian', 'Mr.', 'Right.It', 'hard', 'believe', 'Mae', 'Rose', 'are', 'as', 'clueless', 'initially', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'Brian', 'everything', 'women', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'Internet', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'downtown', 'twenty', 'years', 'Yet', 'scenes', 'Rose', 'Mae', 'first', 'day', 'Internet', 'first', 'night', 'man-hunting', 'gay', 'bar', 'are', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'Rose', 'wrong', 'turn', 'gay', 'bar', 'drag-queen', 'Salsa', 'Matt', 'Palazzolo', 'Oh', 'Grandma', 'Sound', 'Music', 'look', 'so', 'just', 'giving', 'mini-makeover.In', '85', 'minute', 'movie', 'characters', 'undergo', 'drastic', 'hasty', 'behavioral', 'changes', 'movie', 'also', 'rather', 'dizzy', 'transition', 'funny', 'comedy', 'full-on', 'farce', 'vein', 'Auntie', 'Mame', 'whole', 'overall', 'movie', 'works', 'McGee', 'Goans', 'give', 'especially', 'endearing', 'performances', 'also', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'Stewart', 'Carrico', 'gorgeous', 'easy', 'eyes', 'equally', 'dreamy', 'Steve', 'Snyder', 'Chase', 'guy', 'WISH', 'Brian', 'will', 'get', 'clue', 'hurry', 'up', 'hook', 'up', 'diverting', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'also', 'Ginger', 'Pullman', 'Acquah', 'Dansoh', 'Chris', 'Nolan', 'Leif', 'Holt.Keith', 'Hartman', 'strength', 'director/writer', 'honest', 'laughs', 'instead', 'cheap', 'ones', 'humor', 'never', 'expense', 'characters', 'laugh', 'characters', 'never', 'Hartman', 'must', 'be', 'humanity', 'underneath', 'farce', 'order', 'farce', 'work', 'most', 'touching', 'moment', 'late', 'film', 'when', 'Mae', 'Brian', 'want', 'be', 'happy', ""'re"", 'not', 'happy', 'world', 'will', 'change', 'world', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'world', 'change', 'kind', 'unconditional', 'loving', 'response', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'individual', 'hopes', 'receive', 'parents', 'friends', 'loved', 'ones', 'etc.', 'seldom', 'do', 'Son', 'world', 'should', 'be', 'instead', 'how', 'case', 'farce-fantasy', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'film', 'offers', 'hope', 'head', 'heart', 'exactly', 'right', 'place', 'especially', 'heartwarming']",You Should Meet My Son!

True, the storyline is excessive, but that is what satira is.Brian is 30 years old and in the closet, or at least he is when he goes to friday dinner to his mother's home. He has a steady relationship with Dennis, who pretends to be his roommate. Brian's mother, Mae, is so out of the real world that she doesn't even consider the idea his son is gay until one of the candidate girl she brought to him doesn't enlighting her.Here Mae's character, so as that of her sister Rose, turn into wonderful when they set out to find Brian the perfect husband, above all when his relationship with Dennis ends up in a bad way.This is truly a movie about Mae and Rose more than Brian. I really like how Mae, not only understands what is better for his son Brian, but also tries to help other young boys, like she probably would have done for her son if he had the courage to tell her.The supporting characters are all pretty good, I love the leather-couple, and Chase, the chosen husband, is cute with that big brownie eyes, and strange to say, he is even better when he is dressed ;-)Aside from the jokes, this is a movie whose only fault is to try to do its best with the little budget it had. The plot is very good, the actors above the average, and the few sets carefully chosen. Sure, it shows the limited budget, but most of the time you forget it, involved as you are in the adventures of two middle-age women in search of true love... for their dear boy.",5,You Should Meet My Son!

The acting is ""community theater"" level and serviceable.The point of view is flawed. We start with  the son's point of view, then a little late in we're switched to his mother and aunt's pov.  The actor playing the son is better than the rest so he steals the scenes he's in, perhaps that's the issue. The film gives us the adventures of the mom and her sister. Unbeknownst to son, they've learned he is gay. They quickly transition from firmly against to full acceptance then set off to find him a boyfriend to replace the one he's just lost. It all appears to happen in the span of a few days, which is unreasonable for the outcomes.I thought the premise, many segments and a lot of the dialogue were entertaining, even touching.

In brief, a young gay man has tried far too hard to keep his sexuality secret from his mother and aunt - to the point where his partner leaves for greener pastures. Brian's mother and her sister discover the big gay truth and quickly dispense with their culturally acquired bigotry. They then set out on a mission to find heartbroken Brian a suitable gay male partner - taking a crash course in gay community diversity and etiquette in the process. However, thankfully, things are not that simple (and only marginally overladen with stereotypes).Keith Hartman does a wonderful job with the script - keeping things fresh, lively  and relevant. Hartman also ought to take a deep bow as director in his first feature film - and he happily gives  plenty of due credit to the talented crew he assembled to make this film look consistently beautiful and interesting, and to also sound wonderful (especially, as we learn from the commentary tracks, in quite challenging circumstances).The editing is particularly praiseworthy - my award goes to Donna Matthewson. The slightly surreal colours remind me very much of the UK original 1999 Queer As Folk series (NB: the cinematrogaphic quality is much better in this film - no doubt due in part to the advancements in digital technology).The DVD extras are valuable - including Keith's short films in opposition to Proposition 8 (which excluded same sex couples from legal marriage in California). The only (minor) trouble I had with the DVD was in getting the correct commentary track to play - on two different brand players I could only get the one with the actors to work from the ""extras"" menu (no matter what selection I made), but by using the ""audio"" select on the remote I could also choose to hear the commentary by the writer/director and editor.I recommend that anyone who likes the film (surely that's anyone who sees it) should also take the time to watch the film with each of the two commentary tracks - and then watch the film again with the original soundtrack. Your appreciation is significantly amplified, making ""You Should Meet My Son"" a film which you're likely to recommend to all your family and friends, and to enjoy re-watching  with them any number of times. An excellent original music soundtrack adds further lustre.The cast all do a fine job and they must be very proud of the final edit.

Yet, what makes this one pretty special is the verve.....the life.....the acceptance that just pours off the screen, and out over us, from these two marvelous ladies.Oh, and are there ANY bases not covered by first-time, feature length Director, Keith Hartman?  (If I miss any of the important themes he provides, please just add them in a ""Comment"" following this review).  Hmm...let's see now.....I recall that they include:1 - Loss of the long-time boyfriend (don't worry...he doesn't die).2 - Discovery by family of someone's ""abnormal"" sexual orientation (a Big 6 on the Kinsey Scale).3 - Struggle over Acceptance.4 - Search for a suitable replacement, needed due to Item 1, above.  (Doesn't hurt he's a gorgeously hunky go-go dancer, wearing tight briefs)5 - Attempt by a ""Kinsey 6"" at a Heterosexual lifestyle.6 - Consideration of enrollment in a Gay Conversion Therapy program.7 - Time spent in cleaning up all the Holy Mess....created by Items 1 thru 6, above.8 - THE ENDPS--(It's a lot of Fun + Laughs----You'll enjoy it)****",3,"""You Should Meet My Mom & Auntie"" .....

No. Joke.While this film is set in Birmingham, AL, the actors' accents were inconsistent.  I know this fact because I grew up in Alabama.

Really GOOD romantic comedies are not that common, and this film is certainly uncommonly funny, in my opinion.  As I watched it, the thought crossed my mind that some reviewers would call much of the movie stereotypical and cliched, but I didn't care!  So what?  The reason stereotypes and cliches exist is because they're true in life so while I'm not calling this movie ""real life,"" it certainly has enough humorous situations and non-offensive funny characters that it kept me laughing out loud practically throughout the film.  I was caught by surprise that the son/nephew had decided to marry a girl to 1) please his family, 2) have children, and 3) avoid being alone in life, but the script writers dealt with that whole plot twist in a remarkably pleasing way, in my opinion.  I was glad that the religious-right (actually wrong, of course) characters were not overly demonized.  They were certainly ""put in their place,"" but it wasn't really harsh and cruel like it could have been in a gay movie.

Pavlick,"[7, 12]","If you liked Torchsong Trilogy, To Wong Fu, Priscilla Queen of the Dessert or Broke Back Mountain, then you are in for a big disappointment with this film. To me, it was just moderately funny at best and has no real substance. I guess it's amusing that you could find two totally accepting women living in the Bible Belt, who are just thrilled that their son and nephew is gay, but other than that, it is just too unbelievable and doesn't make much sense.The subject of the story, the young man in question is so lack luster and so far into the closet that he can't seem to find the doorknob, even though his mother and Aunt are doing all they can to help him. And I would think that any Mom and Aunt who have accepted their son and nephew's homosexuality and want to help him, would do a lot better to match him up with a regular guy than try to match him up with a room full of drague Queens and Leather S&M; numbers.The tour of the Gay Cure Clinic was funny, but again, a little over the top. Likewise the drague Queen hitting on the fundamentalist minister was amusing, but pretty unlikely. Unlike Torchsong, To Wong Fu and Priscilla, there is no clever or witty dialogue nor are there any great and memorable one-liners in this movie or any great and universal truths.Over all, the entire movie, to me, is very amateurish and silly; it seems like something that might have been filmed in the 1970's. The mother and aunt seem to have much more fun hanging out with gay counter culture people than the son, who is so boring and uncomfortable with himself and anything gay, that he has already lost his first lover to another young man. It basically presents gay men as silly, vascillating individuals who spend their lives pretending to be women, pretending to be macho men and pretending to be happy. There are no middle of the road, well adjusted gay men in this movie; the kind that a mother or aunt would be happy to accept.",2,If You Liked Torch Song Trilogy.....,1329264000,"02 15, 2012",2012,1931,"['liked', 'Torchsong', 'Trilogy', 'Wong', 'Fu', 'Priscilla', 'Queen', 'Dessert', 'Broke', 'Back', 'Mountain', 'then', 'are', 'big', 'disappointment', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'moderately', 'funny', 'best', 'real', 'substance', 'guess', 'amusing', 'could', 'find', 'two', 'totally', 'accepting', 'women', 'living', 'Bible', 'Belt', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'thrilled', 'son', 'nephew', 'gay', 'other', 'just', 'too', 'unbelievable', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense.The', 'subject', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'question', 'so', 'lack', 'luster', 'so', 'far', 'closet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'doorknob', 'even', 'mother', 'Aunt', 'are', 'doing', 'can', 'help', 'would', 'think', 'Mom', 'Aunt', 'who', 'have', 'accepted', 'son', 'nephew', 'homosexuality', 'want', 'help', 'would', 'do', 'lot', 'better', 'match', 'up', 'regular', 'guy', 'try', 'match', 'up', 'room', 'full', 'drague', 'Queens', 'Leather', 'S', 'M', 'tour', 'Gay', 'Cure', 'Clinic', 'was', 'funny', 'again', 'little', 'top', 'Likewise', 'drague', 'Queen', 'hitting', 'fundamentalist', 'minister', 'was', 'amusing', 'pretty', 'unlikely', 'Torchsong', 'Wong', 'Fu', 'Priscilla', 'clever', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'are', 'there', 'great', 'memorable', 'one-liners', 'movie', 'great', 'universal', 'truths.Over', 'entire', 'movie', 'very', 'amateurish', 'silly', 'something', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', '1970', 'mother', 'aunt', 'seem', 'have', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'hanging', 'out', 'gay', 'counter', 'culture', 'people', 'son', 'who', 'so', 'boring', 'uncomfortable', 'anything', 'gay', 'already', 'lost', 'first', 'lover', 'young', 'man', 'basically', 'gay', 'men', 'silly', 'vascillating', 'individuals', 'who', 'spend', 'lives', 'pretending', 'be', 'women', 'pretending', 'be', 'macho', 'men', 'pretending', 'be', 'happy', 'are', 'middle', 'road', 'well', 'adjusted', 'gay', 'men', 'movie', 'kind', 'mother', 'aunt', 'would', 'be', 'happy', 'accept']",You Should Meet My Son!

This is one with a twist though as the central characters are the mother and auntie of our central gay character. He is Brian (Stewart Carrico) and is the only son, of Mae (Joanne McGee). She is a Southern Belle type of mom that Tennessee Williams could have written odes about. She lives with her sister, Aunt Rose (Carol Goans).Their raison d'tre of their entire existence is to get Brian married off to the sweetest little, southern gal and start popping out sweet, little, southern babies. This they do by inviting Brian to dinner and just happening to have also invited an eligible spinster from their wide coterie of friends. Brian always brings his `house mate' Dennis and despite the obvious chemistry between the two men, they just don't get it.Well Dennis finally leaves Brian and discovers his Mr Right. Mother and Auntie then accidentally discover the awful truth that he is - `you know - one of them!' Well after they have gotten used to the idea they decide that they love him just the way he is and set about using their extensive dinner making skills and womanly charms to get him a gay man.Their first port of call is the local gay bar and discorama, which is one of those clubs that has a bit of everything, go go dancer, leather fetish, twinks, drag queens etc. They seem to take to it like a pair of ducks to water and the fun begins.This is a warm comedy and though gay themed there is nothing here that would offend anyone, some cross dressing and no man on man action, as the stars here are the mum and aunt and they really do steal the show especially Joanne McGee who is a tour de force of good intentions - road to hell type woman.Keith Hartman wrote and directed this and it is a brilliant effort. He has managed to get great performances and a good quality production from what was obviously a limited budget as the sound is a bit ropey in places, but that is entirely forgivable. I laughed on a number of occasions and it left me wanting more. So I watched all the extras and there are three excellent short films from Mr Hartman and some `Gratuitous Go Go Boy Footage'. All in all an enjoyable light hearted comedy that deals with all the issues in a caring way but with enough challenges to stop it from getting too schmaltzy.
