839863,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B0002LJU80,Ernest Jagger,"[3, 3]","This review for ""Rainy Dog,"" refers to the region 4 import. Hopefully this latest version of the film is of better quality. This is a Masterpiece of a film. Moreover, it is one of those mobster films where the realistic portrayal of the actors and the cinematography give the viewer a vivid and more realistic portrayal of the world of criminals. The cameras visuals of the rain drenched streets, grimy alleys, run down hotel rooms, dark alleys, and menacing hallways give off a gritty realism that you are actually experiencing the streets of Taipei, which is where the film takes place. ALL of the actors make this film a standout. Furthermore, the near continuous rainfall in the film almost give the viewer the feeling that they are actually in the film. You can also feel the sense of dread and fear in the characters as they all give riveting performances.This is a true Masterpiece of a film. Most of the films I have seen dealing with the criminal underworld are usually set in a nice environment. Everything looks too clean. Not with this film. There are not the usual beautiful women in bikinis and crime bosses smoking cigars on their yachts. None of that silly and stylized type of film we are all too familiar with. No, this film deals with reality: At least as close as one can come to the reality of this dark world of killers. The film is drenched with an atmosphere of hate, betrayal, backstabbing, deceit, and sweat. And done so in a way that make the viewer believe that they are watching a documentary. It's almost as if the viewer is following an event in real time as the criminal world is being exposed. The films narrative centers on one killer in particular. His name is Yuuji (Sho Aikawa). And for Yuuji, being a killer is all he knows. Forget the romanticized killer the film industry most often than not gives the audience. Yuuji knows fear, and when trouble arises he can run away as fast as the bullets he shoots.The action in the film is not the intense style one usually sees in most crime dramas. Here it is more restrained. Yuuji is a former yakuza who makes his living as a hit man in the criminal underworld in Taiwan. However, he has new responsibilities now--a young son. While one cannot sympathize with a character such as Yuuji, you cannot help but feeling a bit of empathy for him. How did he wind up where he is? What made him the man he is now? And can he change? More importantly, will he change? Yuuji must not only contend with his profession and his son in tow, but also with a man who cannot return to Japan until he has seen Yuuji dead. Actor Tomorawa Taguchi [who is depicted on this DVD case] has been in pursuit of Yuuji for some time. We see Yuuji run away from him in one scene--and wonder, why? Yuuji is a hit man. Why doesn't he just take him out? Or is it only about money? Only if the job pays? Or is there more to these two men.There are not too many crime films I like. Sure, some are enjoyable or maybe have that mixture of great action thrown in. But there is something incredibly different with this film. IT FEELS SO REAL. You don't get the impression the actors are acting, but really are what they are. Director Takashi Miike pulled off an incredible job with this film. There are so many realistically portrayed scenes in this film that it would take pages to list them. Moreover, it would ruin the film for you. The first time I saw this film years ago, I knew it was good. And it has been very hard for me to like many crime films because I use this film as a measuring stick. Sure there are some great action films that I enjoy. But when it come to realism--this is the one. If there was ever a film that gave a better description of the mind of a killer and the criminal underworld--I haven't found it. This is the most un-Miike of Miike's films.

This movie is basically the tragic story of a brief period in the life of a lone Yakuza named Yugi who is living in Taiwan.  There is very little dialogue in this movie but somehow that does not seem to detract from the movie.  The plot is easy enough to follow, yakuza Yugi does hits for a Chinese gang and eventually the gang come after him.  This movie is gritty, brooding, dark, depressing, rainy, rainy and more rainy (there must be a monsoon in Taiwan).  The continual rain only seems to add to the squalid appearance of the environment that most of this film is shot in. Along the way Yugi picks up a little, mute boy who is dropped off where he is living by a woman who claims the child is his and also he picks up a prostitute named Lily. Together these 3 people try to outrun the Chinese gang.  I can't rave about the movie but it was an interesting study in this very solitary yakuza man's life.

839866,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B0002LJU80,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[1, 1]","Atypical for Takashi Miike, this film, whose main character is a lone yakuza--and is thus a crime drama--eschews ferocious, nasty violence and instead focuses on the emotional elements of loss and abandonment.  Exiled to Taiwan for a major screwup, Yuji finds almost ceaseless rain in Taipei where he works for a local crime boss as a hitman.But even with his exile, his screwup is not forgiven.  The Japanese boss has sent one of his thugs to Taipei to gun for Yuji; the thug lives on a rooftop and finds pleasure urinating from a great height.  As well as the Japanese gunsel in his life, Yuji has a supposed son, a young boy of 7 or 8, foisted on him by a woman he barely remembers sleeping with, then finds a prostitute to accompany him in his aimless day-to-day existence.Yuji is completely faithful to his Taipei boss, flawlessly in fact, and assassinates the brother of a lawyer whose vengeance knows no bounds.  This sets in motion a tragic cycle of events that, while fraught with violence, still manages to convey, more than anything else, a deep sadness in a life wasted on taking other lives.This is a great film, a unique one for Miike, and the DVD has a terrific special feature included--two separate interviews with Miike taped at different times.  This gives the viewer some real insight into the mind of one of Japan's most interesting contemporary filmmakers.Highly recommended.",4,Not your usual Miike...but great,1095638400,"09 20, 2004",2004,1397,"['Atypical', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'lone', 'yakuza', 'thus', 'crime', 'drama', 'ferocious', 'nasty', 'violence', 'instead', 'focuses', 'emotional', 'elements', 'loss', 'abandonment', 'Exiled', 'Taiwan', 'major', 'screwup', 'Yuji', 'almost', 'ceaseless', 'rain', 'Taipei', 'where', 'local', 'crime', 'boss', 'hitman.But', 'even', 'exile', 'screwup', 'not', 'forgiven', 'Japanese', 'boss', 'sent', 'one', 'thugs', 'Taipei', 'gun', 'Yuji', 'thug', 'rooftop', 'pleasure', 'urinating', 'great', 'height', 'As', 'well', 'Japanese', 'gunsel', 'life', 'Yuji', 'supposed', 'son', 'young', 'boy', '7', '8', 'foisted', 'woman', 'barely', 'sleeping', 'then', 'prostitute', 'accompany', 'aimless', 'day-to-day', 'existence.Yuji', 'completely', 'faithful', 'Taipei', 'boss', 'flawlessly', 'fact', 'brother', 'lawyer', 'vengeance', 'bounds', 'motion', 'tragic', 'cycle', 'events', 'fraught', 'violence', 'still', 'convey', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'deep', 'sadness', 'life', 'wasted', 'taking', 'other', 'lives.This', 'great', 'film', 'unique', 'one', 'Miike', 'DVD', 'terrific', 'special', 'feature', 'included', 'two', 'separate', 'interviews', 'Miike', 'taped', 'different', 'times', 'viewer', 'real', 'insight', 'mind', 'one', 'Japan', 'most', 'interesting', 'contemporary', 'filmmakers.Highly', 'recommended']",Rainy Dog
839867,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B0002LJU80,Tommy Dooley,"[1, 1]","This is from legendary and thankfully very prolific Japanese born film maker Takashi Miike and was part of his Triad trilogy which also included `Shinjuku Triad Society' and `Ley Lines'. This one tells the story of a down at heels Yakuza who has found himself stranded in Taiwan having been abandoned by his `Big Brother' and hence is now `persona non grata' back at home. Yuuji (Sho Ikawa - `Gozy' and `Dead or Alive') lives in a shanty hovel and has to make ends meet by doing bargain hit man jobs for a local Triad crime boss Mr Kes who is about as likable as a dose of the clap. He is also being continually promised that he will get a forged passport so he can get out of the hole he has found himself in, but this is used as a carrot to keep him working.Then a woman turns up and dumps a mute boy on his door step saying that this is your father, she has puit up with him long enough and now the father can deal with it. Yuuji in unmoved and unconcerned as he can not even remember the woman's name. As he has another job to do the kid starts to tag along. As Yuuji has a fear of doing jobs in the rain he ends up waiting out the storm in a brothel where he makes a connection with one of the pros. His next job then presents him with an opportunity to change everything.This is one of the more paced of Miike's films, it does have some gangster violence but instead dwells much more on the inter play between the main three characters and the almost familial bond that is allowed to burgeon. It has a poetic quality that is set against a plot so bleak that it is almost Dickensian, the boy is particularly good at carrying out a role with absolutely no dialogue yet you get to understand him perfectly. The constant rain is used as a metaphor for the crappiness of their existence and the longing for some sun, much like living in England at the moment.This is a thoughtful, well directed and shot film that really demonstrates the breadth and diversity of Miike -`Ichi The Killer' this most certainly is not. I found it totally engrossing and am slowly working my way through his back catalogue. In Japanese and Mandarin, this is for fans of Asian cinema who like their flms a little bit more subtle and ones that do not pull their punches, but still has a few.",4,'Bad Things Happen When It Rains',1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,2269,"['legendary', 'thankfully', 'very', 'prolific', 'Japanese', 'born', 'film', 'maker', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'was', 'part', 'Triad', 'trilogy', 'also', 'included', 'Shinjuku', 'Triad', 'Society', 'Ley', 'Lines', 'one', 'story', 'down', 'heels', 'Yakuza', 'who', 'found', 'stranded', 'Taiwan', 'having', 'been', 'abandoned', 'Big', 'Brother', 'hence', 'now', 'persona', 'non', 'grata', 'back', 'home', 'Yuuji', 'Sho', 'Ikawa', 'Gozy', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'shanty', 'hovel', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'doing', 'bargain', 'hit', 'man', 'jobs', 'local', 'Triad', 'crime', 'boss', 'Mr', 'Kes', 'who', 'about', 'as', 'likable', 'dose', 'clap', 'also', 'being', 'continually', 'promised', 'will', 'get', 'forged', 'passport', 'can', 'get', 'hole', 'found', 'used', 'carrot', 'keep', 'working.Then', 'woman', 'up', 'dumps', 'mute', 'boy', 'door', 'step', 'saying', 'father', 'puit', 'up', 'long', 'enough', 'now', 'father', 'can', 'deal', 'Yuuji', 'unmoved', 'unconcerned', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'remember', 'woman', 'name', 'job', 'do', 'kid', 'tag', 'along', 'Yuuji', 'fear', 'doing', 'jobs', 'rain', 'up', 'waiting', 'storm', 'brothel', 'where', 'connection', 'one', 'pros', 'next', 'job', 'then', 'opportunity', 'change', 'everything.This', 'one', 'more', 'paced', 'Miike', 'films', 'have', 'gangster', 'violence', 'instead', 'dwells', 'much', 'more', 'inter', 'play', 'main', 'three', 'characters', 'almost', 'familial', 'bond', 'allowed', 'burgeon', 'poetic', 'quality', 'set', 'plot', 'so', 'bleak', 'almost', 'Dickensian', 'boy', 'particularly', 'good', 'carrying', 'out', 'role', 'absolutely', 'dialogue', 'yet', 'get', 'understand', 'perfectly', 'constant', 'rain', 'used', 'metaphor', 'crappiness', 'existence', 'longing', 'sun', 'much', 'living', 'England', 'moment.This', 'thoughtful', 'well', 'directed', 'shot', 'film', 'really', 'breadth', 'diversity', 'Miike', 'Killer', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'found', 'totally', 'engrossing', 'am', 'slowly', 'working', 'way', 'back', 'catalogue', 'Japanese', 'Mandarin', 'fans', 'Asian', 'cinema', 'who', 'flms', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'subtle', 'ones', 'do', 'not', 'pull', 'punches', 'still', 'few']",Rainy Dog
