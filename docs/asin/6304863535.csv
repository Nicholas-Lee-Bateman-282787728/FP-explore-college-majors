Of course, Ryoko and the other women at the Masaki household is a bit miffed of this news.  Mayuka is sent to kidnap Tenchi by a demon called Yuzuha who has a grudge on Yosho for 700 years!

438052,AYLQS7IXZVMFP,6304863535,Andres C.,"[10, 14]","The second Tenchi Muyo movie had the same great quality as the first (in colors especially). As you read on, you will see the advantages and disadvantages of this movie and edition.STORY: A blue-haired girl  arrives at the Tenchi house claiming she is Tenchi's daughter. Her name is  Mayuka. She looks like a really cute girl, and everybody likes her, except  for Ryoko who suspects evil intentions and is also jealous. It is soon  realized that she is being controlled by a demon with a sad past. I'll let  you watch the movie to figure out more of the plot.VISUALS: As in the  first, the visuals are magnificent. The colors are really well done and the  lights shine really brightly. These pictures really entice the  viewer.SOUND: Extremely clear and the Dolby Surround Sound gives great  effects. Unfortunately (whether is was just the DVD I got or not) there  were a few instances where the characters spoke from one of the speakers in  the back and it was extremely low and impossible to hear. Simply turn on  the subtitles when these instances occur. Also, there is the usual option  of watching it in Japanese, and thisis always my favorite.EXTRAS: For  those who had never seen Tenchi Muyo before, but stumbled upon this movie,  it really doesn't matter. Included with the DVD is The Tenchi Encyclopedia,  and although their is no motion clips it serves its purpose of going deep  into the back stories and into the characters. It even shows the difference  betwenn the OVA'a and TV Series. More features include two theatrical  trailers (in Japanese), and the ability to set languages and  subtitles.OVERALL: A great experience, but the villain was just a little  weird. She had a great story but the toy part was a bit too strange. Of  course, the movie includes hilarious scenes (i.e. the teddy bear with the  retracting blade). Tenchi fans will love it, and others will too. Receives  4 stars for the usual Tenchi madness and comedy; loses one star because it  doesn't compare to the series.

It was definitely my favorite of all the Tenchi movies.If you haven't already read the summary... A young girl named Mayuka appears insisting on calling Tenchi, ""Daddy"". She appears to have no memory of anything except her daddy for some reason.As Washu tries to decode the girls genetics, Ryoko and Ayeka, instead of directing their jealousy towards each other, they aim it towards Mayuka (physically most of the jealousy comes from Ryoko).I would recommend this DVD for Ryoko and Tenchi fans, since the other couplings don't appear often, if at all.Warning!

In my opinion, this is a poorly done Tenchi movie, and by a poorly done Tenchi movie, I mean a very good regular film. The movie is excellent up to a point, with lots of humor and tons of character development, especially with Ryoko (my favorite character). My only real problem with the film is that it gets really cheesy near the end. This isn't really a problem for younger audiences, and it doesn't take away much from the movie; it just makes the movie seem a bit more like a Disney film than I hoped for.

438055,A2F9AGLWLR7PFN,6304863535,christine,"[0, 0]","I really am an avid fan of Tenchi Muyo! and the other series. It's just that there's one minor factor in the series that gives me the creeps and it bugs me... alot.The movie starts off on Christmas Eve and there's a demon named Yuzuha. She's been holding this grudge forever against Yosho, Tenchi's grandfather. Seeking revenge, Yuzuha steals a bit of Tenchi's hair and mixes her cells with his hair in a cauldron. A girl by the name of Mayuka pops out. Fast forward to the summer. Everyone is enjoying the lazy days. Mayuka appears and starts calling Tenchi &quot;daddy.&quot; The girls are wondering if they are the mother of Mayuka. Ryoko and Aeka are not jealous of each other, but the fact that Mayuka is trying to spend a lot of time with Tenchi.This is the creepy part. For all of you who have watched Shin Tenchi Muyo! or Tenchi in Tokyo, know who the voice of Sakuya Kumashiro is? Yep, that's the same voice of Mayuka. Eww... I have to be astonished that the people that casted the voices would use the same voice. The reason, also, that I gave this movie 4 stars is because the character Mayuka. To complete her mission of bringing Tenchi to Yuzuha's world of darkness, she does these really weird things. One includes kissing him, another, licking Tenchi while he is asleep. Weird. The movie gets a little intense and I just don't understand it.Still, Manatsu no Eve is a good movie to watch.

438056,A3KRWU9KOJHN02,6304863535,Craig Juan,"[1, 2]","Tenchi The Movie 2: The Daughter of Darkness, AKA Tenchi Muyo!: Manatsu No Eve (""Midsummer's Eve""), is undoubtedly one of the greatest among the other three Tenchi movies. It still has some of that ""traditional"" Tenchi humor, highly detailed animation, pulse pounding action, and a bright cast of unforgetable characters, plus two new characters exclusive only to the movie. Now I'm about to tell you what this movie is about (Sorry ! No spoilers, if you want to know every part of the movie !). Christmas has passed, but something strange is about to happen to Tenchi...again. After praying on his mothers gravesite, he found a beautiful young girl by the steps of the Masaki shrine. Her name is Mayuka, a girl with a body of a teenage girl and a mind of a young child. She comes up to Tenchi calling him ""Daddy"". When Tenchi heard this, he began to freak out. But he wasn't the only one who freaked out. Ryoko and Ayeka were acting very jealous (mostly it's Ryoko) when they set sight on Tenchi's so-called daughter. And just like Tenchi, Mayuka harnesses the same power as her ""father"" and can activate the Light Hawk Sword (it's not the real one). According to the predictions of bubble-headed blonde girl Mihoshi, she could be a girl from the future but no one knows exactly who the future mother could be. Could it be Kiyone, Ayeka, Ryoko, Mihoshi, or...Sasami ? There's no proof of it ! Yuzuha, a demon from the dark world, is dead set on getting her revenge on Yosho, the former prince of Jurai a hundred years ago and currently Tenchi's grandfather, for being beaten by his Juraian guards on the day of Startica. Will Tenchi be up to the challenge when he faces Yuzuha in a dangerous battle ? Find out when you get or rent this movie. Now let me talk about how this movie looks. The animation is extremely perfect like all of the Tenchi series and movies (Tenchi in Tokyo looked a little weird, but it didn't lose its sense of brightness). The sceneries, characters, and the special effects are still quite the eye catcher when it comes to pure DVD quality. The sounds are still good with the catchy music, perfect voice acting, and sound effects. The only flaw in the voice acting is that the actors who played as Kiyone, Yosho, and Nobuyuki are from the Tenchi in Tokyo series. But who cares anyway ?! In terms of DVD, just as expected. You still get the dual langauage features and scene selections, plus the ""Tenchi Encyclopedia"" feature, where you will learn about characters, places, and ships from the Tenchi series. And furthermore, you will be able to view trailers of the Japanese original and catalogs for Tenchi merchandise. All in all, one of the greatest Tenchi movies of all time and it truly lives up to the prequel ! If you're a big Tenchi Muyo fan, buy this one now !

It was released as a double-feature alongside &quot;Slayers: the Movie&quot; [which is only 75 minutes in length (Tenchi is 60 minutes)] This is one of my all-time favorite movies, one I never get tired of seeing. What makes the film for me more than anything is the length: a mere sixty minutes! Not really long enough to be considered a &quot;feature-length&quot; film, and not really short enough to be, well...a short. I have a whole philosophy about the use of 'length' in a film. I've seen 2 1/2 hour films that seem to go by in a matter of minutes, and I've seen 75 minute films that DRAG! (and both in ways that work for the film!) Manatsnu Eve has all the plot and story elements of a feature length film, in roughly half the time!  The other thing that makes the film for me is the music. Okay, so it doesn't have Christopher Franke from the first film, but that's all right; the music of Koh Ohtani seems to take the same approach to tone and mood to the film that Franke took to the first film. My favorite piece is the one played during the Shojin dinner. In addition the music itself, its coordination with the film's sound effects is all too admirable, neither complementing nor undermining them.  There is also the story itself, easily one of the best written for the Tenchi series. It is one in which the action is comparable and equal to the dramatic elements and character psychology (a principle of film that seems to have obtained the title of 'lost art'). The relationship between Mayuka and Sasami is as heartwarming as can possibly be achieved (case in point: after the 'bath chase' sequence, when Mayuka has just been sent away from Tenchi's room by a watchdogging Ryoko and Ayeka, Mayuka mopes halfway down the staircase and stops, her head bowed low. Sasami walks over asking how Tenchi is. Mayuka: &quot;I don't know I guess he's not feeling well.&quot; Sasami:&quot;Oh, I'm sorry...hey, you wanna play a game with me?&quot;. CUT to Mayuka, CU as she looks up for the first time. Cut back to Sasami:&quot;M'kay?&quot; CUT back to Mayuka, CU, as her look of sadness fades from her face.) The subtlety of facial expressions, as demonstrated in that scene, are one of the films high points and one cannot help but smile upon viewing of that scene.Overall, it may not be a genuine sequel, and it may have a slighly different produciton crew (Satoshi Kimura instead of series head writer and director Hiroshi Negishi), but you won't even care about that as you will be enthralled by this heartwarming story.",5,Shall I Compare Thee to a Manatsnu Eve?,983923200,"03 7, 2001",2001,2612,"['easily', 'favorite', 'film', 'series', 'not', 'even', 'really', 'sequel', 'was', 'released', 'double-feature', 'alongside', 'quot', 'Slayers', 'Movie', 'quot', 'only', '75', 'minutes', 'length', 'Tenchi', '60', 'minutes', ']', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'movies', 'one', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'seeing', 'What', 'film', 'more', 'anything', 'length', 'mere', 'sixty', 'minutes', 'Not', 'really', 'long', 'enough', 'be', 'considered', 'quot', 'feature-length', 'quot', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'short', 'enough', 'be', 'well', 'short', 'have', 'whole', 'philosophy', 'use', ""'length"", 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', '2', '1/2', 'hour', 'films', 'seem', 'go', 'matter', 'minutes', ""'ve"", 'seen', '75', 'minute', 'films', 'DRAG', 'ways', 'work', 'film', 'Manatsnu', 'Eve', 'plot', 'story', 'elements', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'roughly', 'time', 'other', 'thing', 'film', 'music', 'Okay', ""n't"", 'have', 'Christopher', 'Franke', 'first', 'film', 'right', 'music', 'Koh', 'Ohtani', 'take', 'same', 'approach', 'tone', 'mood', 'film', 'Franke', 'took', 'first', 'film', 'favorite', 'piece', 'one', 'played', 'Shojin', 'dinner', 'addition', 'music', 'coordination', 'film', 'sound', 'effects', 'too', 'admirable', 'complementing', 'undermining', 'also', 'story', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'written', 'Tenchi', 'series', 'one', 'action', 'comparable', 'equal', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'character', 'psychology', 'principle', 'film', 'have', 'obtained', 'title', ""'lost"", 'art', 'relationship', 'Mayuka', 'Sasami', 'as', 'heartwarming', 'can', 'possibly', 'be', 'achieved', 'case', 'point', ""'bath"", 'chase', 'sequence', 'when', 'Mayuka', 'just', 'been', 'sent', 'away', 'Tenchi', 'room', 'watchdogging', 'Ryoko', 'Ayeka', 'Mayuka', 'halfway', 'down', 'staircase', 'stops', 'head', 'bowed', 'low', 'Sasami', 'over', 'asking', 'how', 'Tenchi', 'Mayuka', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'guess', 'not', 'feeling', 'well.', 'quot', 'Sasami', 'quot', 'Oh', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'hey', 'wan', 'play', 'game', 'quot', 'CUT', 'Mayuka', 'CU', 'up', 'first', 'time', 'Cut', 'back', 'Sasami', 'quot', ""M'kay"", 'quot', 'CUT', 'back', 'Mayuka', 'CU', 'look', 'sadness', 'fades', 'face', 'subtlety', 'facial', 'expressions', 'demonstrated', 'scene', 'are', 'one', 'films', 'high', 'points', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'smile', 'viewing', 'scene.Overall', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'genuine', 'sequel', 'may', 'have', 'slighly', 'different', 'produciton', 'crew', 'Satoshi', 'Kimura', 'instead', 'series', 'head', 'writer', 'director', 'Hiroshi', 'Negishi', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'care', 'about', 'will', 'be', 'enthralled', 'heartwarming', 'story']",Tenchi the Movie:Daughter of Darkness VHS

I've watched all three &quot;Tenchi&quot; series again and again on the Cartoon Network, and have become a Tenchi fanatic.  I can't help myself - the characters are compelling and their relationships complex.  This particular movie seems to follow and combine &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; and &quot;Tenchi Universe&quot; in that Tenchi is related to the royal family of planet Jurai, with Lighthawk swords and everything.  I don't think this movie, &quot;Daughter of Darkness,&quot; is for a general audience, as it immediately assumes that the viewer is familiar with the general Tenchi storylines and characters.The movie begins with a pleasant summer day, Tenchi and the girls doing their chores around the house and the Masaki shrine.  As Tenchi prepares to come home for lunch, he is confronted by a young girl, Mayuka, who insistently calls Tenchi her &quot;daddy.&quot;  For all of us who are familiar with Tenchi himself, you know that when something so unusual comes out of nowhere, Tenchi freaks out.  Nothing new here on that tip.  Returning home, of course, Ryoko and Ayeka are beside themselves with jealousy and consternation upon meeting Mayuka.As it turns out, there is a demon-child named Yuzuha who created Mayuka to exact a centuries-planned revenge plot against Lord Katsuhito/Yosho (Tenchi's grandfather).  Tenchi and his family must figure out what to do with Mayuka and how to defeat the demon Yuzuha.  Oddly enough, since the characters and their milieu is taken largely from the first two television series', the plot of the movie closely mirrors the plot of the third series, &quot;Tenchi in Tokyo.&quot;  Another odd parallel is that the English voice actor for Mayuka sounds eerily similar to the voice actor who played Sakuya in &quot;Tokyo.&quot;The best thing about &quot;Daughter of Darkness&quot; for me was the role that Little Washu, my favourite character, plays in the story.  K.T. Vogt, her English voice actor, does a brilliant job, as usual, in making Washu insightful, intelligent, sarcastic, and adorable.  The worst thing about the movie for me was its length.  At only one hour, the movie plays like the last few episodes of a typical series, but without the development of contexts or characters.  Like I said earlier, it assumes you know all the basics.  Also, I don't really understand all the christological referents that surround Mayuka, but I'll leave that to a brighter analyst to parse its significance.At any rate, &quot;Daughter of Darkness&quot; is a fine movie, well-animated (better than the TV shows for my money) and well-acted.  I've already watched it through at least four times, and it really grows on you quickly.  If you love Tenchi, Washu, Mihoshi, Ryoko, Ayeka, Kiyone, Sasami, Katsuhito, Nobuyuki, and Ryo-Ohki already, go and get the movie immediately.

438074,A7FZ9X0B6QBS3,6304863535,Ronald E. Olivier,"[0, 0]","First, let me say that I'm not a big fan of the different Tenchi series.  Though I get occasional laughs at the antics of Ryoko, Ayeka, Tenchi, and Kiyone, the episodes kind of leave me wanting more.  So when I say that I like the First and (especially) the Third Tenchi movies, it's that particular style of storytelling that I find most satisfying in the world of Tenchi.After seeing the first Tenchi movie (Tenchi in Love), I was very encouraged to see what direction I thought the franchise would be going in.  Less cartoonish, better writing and dialog, but still enough goofiness to recognize Tenchi and the gang.  And the first half of this movie appeared to follow suit.  I was very pleased!But the second half of this film didn't just go downhill, it plummeted downward like an airplane that lost it's engines.  It all happens when the girl's true identity is discovered.  I wouldn't be surprised to find out that two completely different staffs of writers were used - one for the first half and one for the second.  I'd be even less surprised if I found out that the two staffs weren't allowed to discuss the project with each other.I really wanted to like this movie, and have watched it a few times hoping that it would grow on me.  It hasn't.If you're a big fan of the various Tenchi series, you'll probably like this a lot more than I do.  But if you're more of a fan of the Tenchi movies, then you'll probably do well to skip this one.",2,Bizarre second movie goes off the deep end.,1361404800,"02 21, 2013",2013,1450,"['First', 'let', 'say', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'different', 'Tenchi', 'series', 'get', 'occasional', 'laughs', 'antics', 'Ryoko', 'Ayeka', 'Tenchi', 'Kiyone', 'episodes', 'kind', 'leave', 'wanting', 'more', 'when', 'say', 'like', 'First', 'especially', 'Third', 'Tenchi', 'movies', 'particular', 'style', 'storytelling', 'find', 'most', 'satisfying', 'world', 'Tenchi.After', 'seeing', 'first', 'Tenchi', 'movie', 'Tenchi', 'Love', 'was', 'very', 'encouraged', 'see', 'what', 'direction', 'thought', 'franchise', 'would', 'be', 'going', 'Less', 'cartoonish', 'better', 'writing', 'dialog', 'still', 'enough', 'goofiness', 'recognize', 'Tenchi', 'gang', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'appeared', 'follow', 'suit', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'go', 'downhill', 'plummeted', 'downward', 'airplane', 'lost', 'engines', 'when', 'girl', 'true', 'identity', 'discovered', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'staffs', 'writers', 'were', 'used', 'one', 'first', 'half', 'one', 'second', ""'d"", 'be', 'even', 'less', 'surprised', 'found', 'out', 'two', 'staffs', 'were', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'discuss', 'project', 'other.I', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'have', 'watched', 'few', 'times', 'hoping', 'would', 'grow', ""'re"", 'big', 'fan', 'various', 'Tenchi', 'series', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'lot', 'more', 'do', ""'re"", 'more', 'fan', 'Tenchi', 'movies', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'do', 'well', 'skip', 'one']",Tenchi the Movie:Daughter of Darkness VHS

Well, at the same time, it is another one not based on the OVA version, (I wonder why they haven't thought of making one based on the OVA series? Why)? and the other movies act like this never happened! Buy yet it still continues to bring the feel of the TV series, and the comedy as well, and this is also gives some background to Yosho's childhood, and it would make think, he seems to be like Tenchi, before he was born and when he was young that is! Anyway, this is a wonderful work, gotta love that Mayuka, and the way she refers to her daddy.12 and older: brief nudity and cartoon violence",4,Good except,1126828800,"09 16, 2005",2005,680,"['Tenchi', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'Thea', 'animation', 'good', 'so', 'are', 'voices', 'Well', 'same', 'time', 'one', 'not', 'based', 'OVA', 'version', 'wonder', 'why', 'have', ""n't"", 'thought', 'making', 'one', 'based', 'OVA', 'series', 'Why', 'other', 'movies', 'act', 'never', 'happened', 'Buy', 'still', 'bring', 'feel', 'TV', 'series', 'comedy', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'background', 'Yosho', 'childhood', 'would', 'make', 'think', 'be', 'Tenchi', 'was', 'born', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'Anyway', 'wonderful', 'work', 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'Mayuka', 'way', 'daddy.12', 'older', 'brief', 'nudity', 'cartoon', 'violence']",Tenchi the Movie:Daughter of Darkness VHS

However like so many otehr anime films based off series this is to short and is more connected to the series than the origional film.  It's still entertaining but is a little more silly than the first.This time around Tenchi and the Gang must unravle the mystery behind the girl who claims to be Tenchis daughter.  She shows up out of no where and starts calling Tenchi Daddy.  Obviously the girls are not happy.  WHat they don't know is that there is this little demon who wants Tenchi dead and is using the daughter to accomplish this task.  Through more comedy and a pretty cool ending, this hour long ""mini movie"" tells a pretty good story, but is more liek the series than the first.The reason I keep comparing this one to the first is because the first Tenchi movie was incredible.  I am not a Tenchi Muyo fan and the first had me in it's grasp the entire time.  This one is little more lackluster than the first.  However if you are a Tenchi Muyo fan (series) than you will enjoy this film ther is no doubt about that.",3,This is mroe for die hard tenchi fans than anime fans,1019347200,"04 21, 2002",2002,1083,"['Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'pretty', 'good', 'piece', 'work', 'However', 'so', 'many', 'otehr', 'anime', 'films', 'based', 'off', 'series', 'short', 'more', 'connected', 'series', 'origional', 'film', 'still', 'entertaining', 'little', 'more', 'silly', 'first.This', 'time', 'Tenchi', 'Gang', 'must', 'unravle', 'mystery', 'girl', 'who', 'be', 'Tenchis', 'daughter', 'up', 'where', 'calling', 'Tenchi', 'Daddy', 'Obviously', 'girls', 'are', 'not', 'happy', 'WHat', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'little', 'demon', 'who', 'Tenchi', 'dead', 'using', 'daughter', 'accomplish', 'task', 'more', 'comedy', 'pretty', 'cool', 'ending', 'hour', 'long', 'mini', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'more', 'liek', 'series', 'first.The', 'reason', 'keep', 'comparing', 'one', 'first', 'first', 'Tenchi', 'movie', 'was', 'incredible', 'am', 'not', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'fan', 'first', 'had', 'entire', 'time', 'one', 'little', 'more', 'lackluster', 'first', 'However', 'are', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'fan', 'series', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'ther', 'doubt']",Tenchi the Movie:Daughter of Darkness VHS
