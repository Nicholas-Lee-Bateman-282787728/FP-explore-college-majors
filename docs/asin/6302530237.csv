318949,A2BC9TW5GO4XJR,6302530237,Celia DLF,"[0, 0]",Good early 70's mystery thriller with amusing moments.  Has something of the look of a made-for-TV movie.  A racing car driver develops psychic abilities and a young woman with expertise in that area helps him interpret what the visions he has mean.  They end up at a mansion in England to save a woman being menaced by mysterious incidents.  The movie has some atmospheric moments.  The actors do an OK job.  Leonard Nimoy and Susan Hampshire do their mystery solving like they were an adult Hardy Boy and Nancy Drew.  Still pretty good film.  The Scorpion Releasing DVD has the US and the UK versions and is in excellent condition.

One  has a choice  of  seeing  either  the  US (longer) or the British (shorter). I like the  movie and  recommend getting it.,5,Baffled,1405036800,"07 11, 2014",2014,242,"['remember', 'watching', 'Baffled', 'when', 'appeared', 'TV', 'Great', 'film', 'clear', 'was', 'pilot', 'series', 'One', 'choice', 'seeing', 'US', 'longer', 'British', 'shorter', 'movie', 'recommend', 'getting']",Baffled VHS

Since it is a TV Movie, there is nothing offensive, even though Scorpion Releasing offers us the shorter British version and longer American version.

318953,A2HIBAJEMRFX3W,6302530237,"Michael Rogers ""Mego73""","[3, 3]","Baffled! was a 1973 TV movie/pilot made in the UK distributed by ITC (The Muppet Show, Space:1999). It was also shown theatrically in some places. In the early 80's it was released to video by 20'th Century Fox video. Since then it was out of print until the mid 90's when it was released on another label recorded in EP. It also was edited compared to the 20'th Century Fox video version (I estimate the editing at about 5 minutes). That video is also now out of print. Now, Baffled can be streamed from Amazon, but alas has the most recent master which is the one that was used for that video and carries the edits. Still a worthy movie to check out, but I wish it was complete.",4,Fun movie to stream but EDITED,1333152000,"03 31, 2012",2012,680,"['Baffled', 'was', '1973', 'TV', 'movie/pilot', 'made', 'UK', 'distributed', 'ITC', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'Space:1999', 'was', 'also', 'shown', 'theatrically', 'places', 'early', '80', 'was', 'released', 'video', ""20'th"", 'Century', 'Fox', 'video', 'then', 'was', 'print', 'mid', '90', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'label', 'recorded', 'EP', 'also', 'was', 'edited', 'compared', ""20'th"", 'Century', 'Fox', 'video', 'version', 'estimate', 'editing', '5', 'minutes', 'video', 'also', 'now', 'print', 'Now', 'Baffled', 'can', 'be', 'streamed', 'Amazon', 'most', 'recent', 'master', 'one', 'was', 'used', 'video', 'edits', 'Still', 'worthy', 'movie', 'check', 'out', 'wish', 'was', 'complete']",Baffled VHS
318954,A39NXAD50F6YVZ,6302530237,Winston Smith,"[5, 5]","If you are a fan of 70s-era made-for-TV horror, this will fit the bill nicely. Nimoy plays a race car driver who inexplicably starts getting psychic premonitions, which lead him to mysterious goings on at an old English castle. He brings a plucky blonde paranormal expert along for the ride. A bit X-files meets Scooby Doo at the Night Gallery. And a GREAT atmospheric soundtrack. Unfortunately the transfer is a big disappointment. You'll see distracting, blocky MPEG compression artifacts frequently (even the highest setting of noise-reduction on my TV didn't help...) and occassional horizontal tracking lines, suggesting this was sourced from tape. That said, it is a WATCHABLE transfer... comparable to some of the crappy multi-disc/public domain box sets you might find in the bargain bin.",3,"70s Made-For-TV Horror is a fun find, lousy transfer.",1391212800,"02 1, 2014",2014,796,"['are', 'fan', '70s-era', 'made-for-TV', 'horror', 'will', 'fit', 'bill', 'nicely', 'Nimoy', 'race', 'car', 'driver', 'who', 'inexplicably', 'getting', 'psychic', 'premonitions', 'lead', 'mysterious', 'goings', 'old', 'English', 'castle', 'plucky', 'blonde', 'paranormal', 'expert', 'ride', 'bit', 'X-files', 'meets', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Night', 'Gallery', 'GREAT', 'atmospheric', 'soundtrack', 'Unfortunately', 'transfer', 'big', 'disappointment', ""'ll"", 'see', 'distracting', 'blocky', 'MPEG', 'compression', 'artifacts', 'frequently', 'even', 'highest', 'setting', 'noise-reduction', 'TV', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'occassional', 'horizontal', 'tracking', 'lines', 'suggesting', 'was', 'sourced', 'tape', 'said', 'WATCHABLE', 'transfer', 'comparable', 'crappy', 'multi-disc/public', 'domain', 'box', 'sets', 'might', 'find', 'bargain', 'bin']",Baffled VHS
