He is truly convincing as the legendary, unpredictable gunfighter Frank Morgan. He's as bad as they come but not without style. This movie rates up there with any western made yet. If you love westerns, this is a must see. If you enjoy Mr. Henriksen's bravado-style of acting, setting him apart in any role he plays, this is a must own.

I was from the opening scenes, pleased with this movie.  It was good to see a western where the lead character is gritty, not ' politically correct ', and is his own man. In a bio on Lance, I read where he really put himself into this role, and was able to handle his own stunts and revolver work.  The results being a good old fashioned western where a dark hero comes to the aid of someone from his past, and no matter what the odds, he prevails.  One can also note themes taken from other westerns like High Noon, when the townsfolks refuse to assist their local stand in law man.  But it is Frank Morgan's story, and Lance makes Frank come alive and he steals every scene he's in.  The closing scene seems to be a fitting end for such a good film.  His daughter, finally coming to know that this stranger gunman, was her real father...as he rides off.  I have an extensive collection of western films and now having seen Gunfighter's Moon, rank it as perhaps my favorite of all.

His &quot;tough as nails&quot; gunfighter is, in my opinion, the best ever done in any movie. He has a physical presence and a capacity for projecting menace that no one can match. This movie also has &quot;texture,&quot; meaning the sets and scenes don't quite have that too-pat look.

First off, this DVD played flawlessly in my Bluray player and the picture was fantastic.Now........for the movie.  Lance ( character Frank Morgan)  has a face that's the classic look of a time tested gunfighter should look like.  His eyes, look and swagger, his voice........all what you would expect a legendary gunfighter should be.  One of my all time favorite westerns.  Not well known, which is a real shame.  If you ever get the chance to see it, dont pass it up.

His autobiography,Not Bad for a Human: The Life and Films of Lance Henriksenis a seriously entertaining read. So as a self-confessed fan, I dropped a Jackson to purchaseGunfighter's Moon. One has to admire Henriksen's deep commitment to a role; and in Gunfighter's Moon, Henriksen's Frank Morgan is no exception. As I discovered in his autobiography, LH had spurs, hat, and probably more custom made for him. He went around the set (and apparently off the set too) living the role of a gunfighter. His stance, his look, his entire demeanor personifies the old west tough guy. But this tough guy has a soft spot for his former lover. And when she telegraphs him to come and save her now husband, Frank discovers that he has a sixteen year old daughter, who is unaware of his existence. The film bears similarities to the classicHigh Noon: 60th Anniversary Edition [Blu-ray] in that the town sheriff is abandoned by the town to face three outlaws determined to get one of their compadres out of jail. Now to my opinion. Some scenes are very well done, while others are uncomfortably weak. There is a scene with Frank and Linda that works on all levels. There is a scene in the bar with the bartender pushing around his hired help that is sadly weak. It seems that in Lance Henriksen's long career, he was slave to his screenwriters and directors. When paired with a quality script, talented co-stars and a director with talent, Henriksen could contribute on all levels. Sadly, that wasn't always the case. No actor can carry a film on his own. Nobody.In the end I enjoyed Gunfighter's Moon and if you are a fan of Lance Henriksen, I would give it a try. Unfortunately, being out of print, there is a stiff premium on this DVD. If you find it for $20 or less, I would snap it up as I don't see this being remastered on blu-ray anytime soon. Probably never.Recommended because of the lead actor, Lance Henriksen.",4,"Inconsistent, but ultimately successful...",1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,2028,"['**Minor', 'Spolier', 'Alert**Ever', 'sinceMillennium', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'have', 'followed', 'career', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'autobiography', 'Not', 'Bad', 'Human', 'Life', 'Films', 'Lance', 'Henriksenis', 'seriously', 'entertaining', 'read', 'So', 'self-confessed', 'fan', 'dropped', 'Jackson', 'purchaseGunfighter', 'Moon', 'One', 'admire', 'Henriksen', 'deep', 'commitment', 'role', 'Gunfighter', 'Moon', 'Henriksen', 'Frank', 'Morgan', 'exception', 'discovered', 'autobiography', 'LH', 'had', 'spurs', 'hat', 'probably', 'more', 'custom', 'made', 'went', 'set', 'apparently', 'set', 'too', 'living', 'role', 'gunfighter', 'stance', 'look', 'entire', 'demeanor', 'old', 'west', 'tough', 'guy', 'tough', 'guy', 'soft', 'spot', 'former', 'lover', 'when', 'telegraphs', 'come', 'save', 'now', 'husband', 'Frank', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'who', 'unaware', 'existence', 'film', 'similarities', 'classicHigh', 'Noon', '60th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'town', 'sheriff', 'abandoned', 'town', 'face', 'three', 'outlaws', 'determined', 'get', 'one', 'compadres', 'jail', 'Now', 'opinion', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'others', 'are', 'uncomfortably', 'weak', 'scene', 'Frank', 'Linda', 'levels', 'scene', 'bar', 'bartender', 'pushing', 'hired', 'help', 'sadly', 'weak', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'long', 'career', 'was', 'slave', 'screenwriters', 'directors', 'When', 'paired', 'quality', 'script', 'talented', 'co-stars', 'director', 'talent', 'Henriksen', 'could', 'contribute', 'levels', 'Sadly', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'case', 'actor', 'can', 'carry', 'film', 'own', 'end', 'enjoyed', 'Gunfighter', 'Moon', 'are', 'fan', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'would', 'give', 'try', 'Unfortunately', 'being', 'print', 'stiff', 'premium', 'DVD', 'find', '20', 'less', 'would', 'snap', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'being', 'remastered', 'blu-ray', 'anytime', 'soon', 'Probably', 'never.Recommended', 'lead', 'actor', 'Lance', 'Henriksen']",N/A

I put it in a friends VHS player this year and her player chewed up the tape.  I have been searching for a DVD but those that I have found, are standing at $100.00 each or more on Amazon and other sites.  This is a western that avid western fans can appreciate and recall past westerns, where a gun fighter came into town to save the day....like ""Gun fight at the O.K. Corral"", ""Shane"", ""High Plains Drifter"" and the most recent ""Pale Rider"".  Lance Henrikson is a phenomenal actor who might not ever get his just due, because I have not seen him in any recent flicks.  Gunfighter's Moon is the only movie that I can recall him having a leading role in.  I remember his role in the first Terminator"" Movie as a detective at the Police Station. He had a one liner in that movie, but it was still great.
