They don't have enough brains to simply follow their snowmobile trail out of the forest back to the truck. With riveting scenes like her gathering wood, and fascinating cinematic imagery of her eating a granola bar, it's a wonder this didn't clean up at all the award ceremonies.

Emma suffers from vivid dreams and hallucinations.The film drops clues as to what is going on. It leads you in one direction and then another.
