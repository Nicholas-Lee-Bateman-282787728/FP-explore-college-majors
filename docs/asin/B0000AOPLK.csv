So whether you're a Mormon or not, if you think Mormons are funny, you will find this movie funny.""The R.M."" is even funnier, in some respects.I do not recommend this movie to just any non-Mormon viewer, though.

Having lived my life in Michigan (except the two years in Australia), the LDS church isn't mentioned much in the popular media and when it is it is too often in predictable stereotypes.  So, this movie and its cousins are welcome fresh air to me.This is a pretty funny movie.  Will Swenson is pretty good in the lead role.  He has a nice screen presence and has a light touch in what less able hands could turn into mush.  Connie Young is also quite nice as Cammie.  The plot is predictable and no one is claiming high art here, but there are some fine moments.  Before the divorce when Jordan is opening the fridge and we see the beer immediately and it takes him awhile to do the double take just about the time we are wondering why it's in their fridge.  And when he realizes Cammie's father is a general authority.  And, thankfully, when Cammie actually leaves on her mission.But some of the comedy is too heavy handed.  The controller for the big screen TV is over the top.  The beyond the valley of the nerds nerdishness of a couple of the characters is just too much.  And though the carrot shavings in the green Jell-O may be a delicious target for those who find the clich?s of our culture a bit much, and artist (even a journeyman artist) must know that the easy targets, especially clich?s, must be left alone.  Work a bit harder and think of something more fresh.  There is plenty to go after.But, those are minor quibbles.  Thanks for making the movie and for helping us get at our culture through movies.

765129,A169I83JL8QJGN,B0000AOPLK,Daniel A Moir,"[4, 5]","Anyone who has been reading my reviews should know my secret now... If not I'll tell you... I'm LDS (Mormon.) Not only that, but I'm proud of it, never hiding the fact, or fearing public ridicule which is commonplace in many of the non-Utah states I've lived in. I won't get into politics, or religion here though.I must confess that this isn't a movie that a ""non-member"" would enjoy, as the film is very much a satire of LDS Single life. Many may not know this, but being single and being LDS is a terrible way to live life, as we are taught that family is the most important thing in life. Many LDS single adults get caught up in this idea and sometimes end up marrying the wrong person, that's what happens to our main man Jonathan who ends up divorcing after his wife looses faith in the church and resorts to alcohol and cigarettes (a big no-no in our faith.) From there Jonathan himself begins to loose faith... though not as badly, and ends up going inactive (stops going to church) until one day fate steps in and strands him at an LDS Singles dance (the horror!) where he meets Cammie a beautiful young woman who also serves as the ward activities director... there's only one problem, she had called him earlier to invite him to a church activity and he rather rudely told her off. Now Jonathan must make things right and prove to Cammie that he is not the jerk that he made himself out to be.While the premise is pretty straight forward, what is enjoyable about this film is the way it perfectly parodies LDS Singles Wards. The sad truth of it is that real Singles Wards really do often come off as being as low, picky, desperate, and pathetic as many of the characters (as loveable as they really are) of this film are. While the movie very much plays off of stereotypes its scary how a member of a real Singles Ward can go through the cast of characters and find someone in their own ward to match that character up with. The film also parodies life in Utah to some extent, and is an excellent piece that one could use to give someone a comical view of what Mormons are really like. No we don't have horns on our head...The downside to this movie is that it has an extremely limited audience. Not only is this movie not going to make sense to ""non-Mormons"" but it will also alienate anyone who has yet to experience the LDS Singles Ward sub culture that the movie parodies, which is a lot of older Mormons, and many who live in areas that may not have, or many not have easy access to a Singles Ward. While I highly recommend this film, I also caution that anyone who may want to see the film go to an LDS Singles Ward for a while first, that way you'll be able to appreciate the humor this great movie has to offer.",5,A wholesome crazy LDS comedy,1034035200,"10 8, 2002",2002,2730,"['Anyone', 'who', 'been', 'reading', 'reviews', 'should', 'know', 'secret', 'now', 'not', ""'ll"", 'tell', ""'m"", 'LDS', 'Mormon', 'Not', 'only', ""'m"", 'proud', 'never', 'hiding', 'fact', 'fearing', 'public', 'ridicule', 'commonplace', 'many', 'non-Utah', 'states', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'politics', 'religion', 'here', 'must', 'confess', ""n't"", 'movie', 'non-member', 'would', 'enjoy', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'satire', 'LDS', 'Single', 'life', 'Many', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'being', 'single', 'being', 'LDS', 'terrible', 'way', 'live', 'life', 'are', 'taught', 'family', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'life', 'Many', 'LDS', 'single', 'adults', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'idea', 'sometimes', 'end', 'up', 'marrying', 'wrong', 'person', 'what', 'main', 'man', 'Jonathan', 'who', 'up', 'divorcing', 'wife', 'faith', 'church', 'resorts', 'alcohol', 'cigarettes', 'big', 'no-no', 'faith', 'Jonathan', 'loose', 'faith', 'though', 'not', 'badly', 'up', 'going', 'inactive', 'going', 'church', 'one', 'day', 'fate', 'steps', 'LDS', 'Singles', 'dance', 'horror', 'where', 'Cammie', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'also', 'ward', 'activities', 'director', 'only', 'one', 'problem', 'had', 'called', 'earlier', 'invite', 'church', 'activity', 'rather', 'rudely', 'told', 'off', 'Now', 'Jonathan', 'must', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'prove', 'Cammie', 'not', 'jerk', 'made', 'be.While', 'premise', 'pretty', 'straight', 'forward', 'what', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'way', 'perfectly', 'LDS', 'Singles', 'Wards', 'sad', 'truth', 'real', 'Singles', 'Wards', 'really', 'do', 'often', 'come', 'off', 'as', 'being', 'low', 'picky', 'desperate', 'pathetic', 'many', 'characters', 'as', 'loveable', 'really', 'are', 'film', 'are', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'plays', 'stereotypes', 'scary', 'how', 'member', 'real', 'Singles', 'Ward', 'can', 'go', 'cast', 'characters', 'find', 'someone', 'own', 'ward', 'match', 'character', 'up', 'film', 'also', 'life', 'Utah', 'extent', 'excellent', 'piece', 'one', 'could', 'use', 'give', 'someone', 'comical', 'view', 'what', 'Mormons', 'are', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'horns', 'head', 'downside', 'movie', 'extremely', 'limited', 'audience', 'Not', 'only', 'movie', 'not', 'going', 'make', 'sense', 'non-Mormons', 'will', 'also', 'alienate', 'anyone', 'who', 'yet', 'experience', 'LDS', 'Singles', 'Ward', 'sub', 'culture', 'movie', 'parodies', 'lot', 'older', 'Mormons', 'many', 'who', 'live', 'areas', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'many', 'not', 'have', 'easy', 'access', 'Singles', 'Ward', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'also', 'caution', 'anyone', 'who', 'may', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'go', 'LDS', 'Singles', 'Ward', 'while', 'first', 'way', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'appreciate', 'humor', 'great', 'movie', 'offer']",N/A

It really does pick on the the funny quirks of the LDS religion, but doesn't enter the realm of being sacriligious or completely rude to the LDS faith.The stereotypical characters are a real hoot!!! You find nearly every type of Mormon and even non-Mormons living in Provo.There were a coupe of scenes that were a little bit unrealistic. Like when the police want to see the main character's ID when he is hiding from the Bishop with his laundry. Or the fact that a group of people can drive from the hills of Provo, somehow drive through American Fork (jumping the railroad tracks), and make it to Salt Lake International in just 20 minutes. But other than annoying things like this, it was a lot of fun.If you aren't LDS, I don't think you'll get a lot of the humor. If you are, then the humor is fantastic. It is nice to sit back and laugh at ourselves now and then.The soundtrack to this movie is AMAZING. I have got to buy it!! Sure, the tempo of church favorites has been increased (with added percussion), but it is still wonderful to listen to.The only other thing that didn't sit right with me about this movie with the main character's conversion at the end. I just didn't buy it. Though, I've got to hand it to the director... it is not an easy thing to pull off.Fun, fun, fun... most definately a 5 star movie.

There wasn't hume, but a series of small, short ""joke sound-bites.""  But there was no extended humor in this film.  It was moving from one funny situation to the next funny situation for about two hours, with a little romance thrown in.Second, cameos drove this film.  Therefore, it was not a film about an idea or a character, but more like seeing a moving version of ""Where's Waldo,"" or ""I spy a Nephite.""  But was there any real point o having all of the famous people in the movie?  Did Gordon Jump have any real purpose, except for delivering lines.  The only cameo that made sense was Richard Dutcher's cameo, and probably the only real funny part of the film.  Possibly Jimmy Chunga's cameo as the ""Phat Cop"" made some sense, since he wanted to be a copy a while ago.  But what about the other appearances?Thirdly, this film was driven by stereotypes.  The jokes about jello, all arguments ending in a NiCMO, the happy marriage with church serive at the end, etc, etc, etc was painful to watch.  Dutcher already hit the stereotypes in ""God's Army,"" and ""Saturday's Warrior"" is its own stereotype.  But did any member of the locval word seem interesting to you?  Aside from the Bungee roommate?Lastly, this film missed the essence of Mormonism.  The fundamental doctrine of Mormonism is Christ's Atonement, which was never mentioned in the film.  They missed the Messiah, and therefore missed the message of Mormonism.  Frankly any ward, stake, or mission that is Christless is not worth attending, so I sympathize with the lead character.Another point that was missed was the date scene at the miniature golf.  If a girl who I've been chasing finally accepts then says she's going on a mission, I would be absolutely frosted.  She only accepted the date because I could not go anywhere with the relationship.  It would basically be a watered down NiCMO.The one good point that was brought up in the film I the aspect of social pressure to marry.  The saints tend to rely on peer-pressure and sociological arguments for marriage, but ignore the theological reason for why they marry.So, let's try doing something like this again, and remember what our Prophet Joseph Smith taught, that ""The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.""",3,SO I didn't like it--find out why!!!,1030060800,"08 23, 2002",2002,2627,"['did', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'please', 'read', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'assume', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'other', 'reasons', 'what', 'say.First', 'gags', 'drove', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'hume', 'series', 'small', 'short', 'joke', 'sound-bites', 'was', 'extended', 'humor', 'film', 'was', 'moving', 'one', 'funny', 'situation', 'next', 'funny', 'situation', 'about', 'two', 'hours', 'little', 'romance', 'thrown', 'in.Second', 'cameos', 'drove', 'film', 'Therefore', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'idea', 'character', 'more', 'seeing', 'moving', 'version', 'Where', 'Waldo', 'spy', 'Nephite', 'was', 'there', 'real', 'point', 'o', 'having', 'famous', 'people', 'movie', 'Did', 'Gordon', 'Jump', 'have', 'real', 'purpose', 'delivering', 'lines', 'only', 'cameo', 'made', 'sense', 'was', 'Richard', 'Dutcher', 'cameo', 'probably', 'only', 'real', 'funny', 'part', 'film', 'Possibly', 'Jimmy', 'Chunga', 'cameo', 'Phat', 'Cop', 'made', 'sense', 'wanted', 'be', 'copy', 'while', 'ago', 'what', 'other', 'appearances', 'Thirdly', 'film', 'was', 'driven', 'stereotypes', 'jokes', 'jello', 'arguments', 'ending', 'NiCMO', 'happy', 'marriage', 'church', 'serive', 'end', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'was', 'painful', 'watch', 'Dutcher', 'already', 'hit', 'stereotypes', 'God', 'Army', 'Saturday', 'Warrior', 'own', 'stereotype', 'did', 'member', 'locval', 'word', 'seem', 'interesting', 'Aside', 'Bungee', 'roommate', 'Lastly', 'film', 'missed', 'essence', 'Mormonism', 'fundamental', 'doctrine', 'Mormonism', 'Christ', 'Atonement', 'was', 'never', 'mentioned', 'film', 'missed', 'Messiah', 'therefore', 'missed', 'message', 'Mormonism', 'Frankly', 'ward', 'stake', 'mission', 'Christless', 'not', 'worth', 'attending', 'sympathize', 'lead', 'character.Another', 'point', 'was', 'missed', 'was', 'date', 'scene', 'miniature', 'golf', 'girl', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'chasing', 'finally', 'accepts', 'then', 'going', 'mission', 'would', 'be', 'absolutely', 'frosted', 'only', 'accepted', 'date', 'could', 'not', 'go', 'anywhere', 'relationship', 'would', 'basically', 'be', 'watered', 'down', 'NiCMO.The', 'one', 'good', 'point', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'film', 'aspect', 'social', 'pressure', 'marry', 'saints', 'tend', 'rely', 'peer-pressure', 'sociological', 'arguments', 'marriage', 'ignore', 'theological', 'reason', 'why', 'marry.So', 'let', 'try', 'doing', 'something', 'again', 'remember', 'what', 'Prophet', 'Joseph', 'Smith', 'taught', 'fundamental', 'principles', 'religion', 'are', 'testimony', 'Apostles', 'Prophets', 'concerning', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'died', 'was', 'buried', 'rose', 'again', 'third', 'day', 'ascended', 'heaven', 'other', 'things', 'pertain', 'religion', 'are', 'only']",N/A

However, despite the stereotypes, some of the older-than-the-hills humor, and the contrived cameo appearances by numerous LDS celebrities (Brother ""Niner""?  Brother ""Angel""?), I couldn't help laughing at many of the farcical situations and characters that the film portrays, in which any long-term LDS church member can find a kernel of truth.  Taken as satire, this film succeeds on various levels.Some of the funniest material is in the outtakes, particularly (a) when Will Swenson pulls out a bottle of ""beer"" and tells Connie Young, ""Brigham, Schmigham!  Want to make out?"" and (b) when one of the hapless cops (played by Salt Lake City radio personality Jimmy Chunga) tells Connie Young (who is on the wall above him), ""Ma'am, move away from the building...do you work out?""

765137,A1GTHUO4BOBWCR,B0000AOPLK,Neildo,"[3, 22]","""Singles Ward"" looks and feels like a 2 hour ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch with a mormon twist to it.  While occasionally funny and clever, the majority of the humor comes from stereotypical mormon jokes.  Yes, there are jello jokes, ""friendimonies"", heavy use of the word ""flip"", poking fun at the BYU marriage obsession, and all the other stuff anyone who's lived in Utah has already heard.  Someone just decided to film them.A big problem with this film is that all the jokes are just thrown together with no real cohesion.  They film makers try to wrap them all up in a love story about a guy who has drifted away from the LDS church but quickly comes back to pursue a girl.  When this plot takes the driver's seat, things become really long and painful.The 2 main characters (the guy and girl in love) really bring this film down.  Although he's supposed to be the main source of humor, the guy's delivery is lacking.  The problem with the girl is probably due to bad scripting, as she comes off as very self-righteous and judgemental.  I think we're supposed to like her,  but other than having a nice face and figure, there's really nothing to like.The minor characters of the film save this movie from being a complete waste.  I thought the guy getting ready to go on a mission was good, as well as the guy who's consistantly hitting on the ladies.As a film, ""Singles Ward"" barely justifies being called a movie.  As a sketch comedy on video, the first hour can be mildly rewarding, and after that, pain.",2,Bad movie or  occasionally funny 2 hour sketch?,1030492800,"08 28, 2002",2002,1511,"['Singles', 'Ward', 'feels', '2', 'hour', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'sketch', 'mormon', 'twist', 'occasionally', 'funny', 'clever', 'majority', 'humor', 'stereotypical', 'mormon', 'jokes', 'Yes', 'are', 'jello', 'jokes', 'friendimonies', 'heavy', 'use', 'word', 'flip', 'poking', 'fun', 'BYU', 'marriage', 'obsession', 'other', 'stuff', 'anyone', 'who', 'lived', 'Utah', 'already', 'heard', 'Someone', 'just', 'decided', 'film', 'them.A', 'big', 'problem', 'film', 'jokes', 'are', 'just', 'thrown', 'together', 'real', 'cohesion', 'film', 'makers', 'try', 'wrap', 'up', 'love', 'story', 'guy', 'who', 'drifted', 'away', 'LDS', 'church', 'quickly', 'back', 'pursue', 'girl', 'When', 'plot', 'driver', 'seat', 'things', 'become', 'really', 'long', 'painful.The', '2', 'main', 'characters', 'guy', 'girl', 'love', 'really', 'bring', 'film', 'down', 'supposed', 'be', 'main', 'source', 'humor', 'guy', 'delivery', 'lacking', 'problem', 'girl', 'probably', 'due', 'bad', 'scripting', 'off', 'very', 'self-righteous', 'judgemental', 'think', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'like', 'other', 'having', 'nice', 'face', 'figure', 'really', 'nothing', 'like.The', 'minor', 'characters', 'film', 'save', 'movie', 'being', 'complete', 'waste', 'thought', 'guy', 'getting', 'ready', 'go', 'mission', 'was', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'guy', 'who', 'consistantly', 'hitting', 'ladies.As', 'film', 'Ward', 'barely', 'being', 'called', 'movie', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'video', 'first', 'hour', 'can', 'be', 'mildly', 'rewarding', 'pain']",N/A
765138,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B0000AOPLK,Nicholas Carroll,"[11, 15]","Overall, this film isn't a bad starting film for Halestorm Entertainment.  To ensure that this film was successful in the newly formed LDS film industry, there were plenty of hilarious cameos by LDS Celebrities like Steve Young (who is just awesome in his comedic cameo), Julie Stoffer of ""MTV's The Real World New Orleans"" infamy (her cameo was in a brilliant and cleverly cut sequence), and Richard Dutcher (who made ""God's Army""), among other notables.The one big thing I disliked about this film was the direct talking to the audience by the main character, a device I'm personally not fond of.  I think it would have worked much better playing it straight up.  The film starts out funny enough, but the jokes seem to run out half way through and drags to its conclusion.  It probably could have been trimmed by ten minutes, as comedies usually shouldn't go much beyond 80-90 minutes.  Always leave the audience wanting more, not feeling like the jokes were stretched thin to cover over a formulaic ""romantic comedy plot"".I was hoping to see more scenes of Provo, as this film would have made a nice ""souvenir"" of my two years there.  I'm only vaguely familiar with the Singles Ward, but I remember the little games people played about asking others on dates (the playful and childish way of indirectly asking someone out on a date).  That much of the film rings true.  The acting overall is pretty good, but I always knew that Utah Valley had incredible talent waiting to be tapped into.  This isn't a bad debut film for Halestorm Entertainment, and so far, they've made about four other films and I hope they will keep on making these types of films.  There are many stories worth telling, from the LDS perspective.  BYU is practically a gold mine of stories that Hollywood is too snobby to look into, so Halestorm deserves much credit and support for what they are doing in the world of feature films for a niche market.This DVD has cool extra features that make it worth adding to one's personal library.  My favorite is the music video by Jericho Road, the Mormon answer to the boy band 98 Degrees or All-4-One.  The song and video is awesome and can definitely give NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, 98 Degrees a run for their money.  Its certainly a better song than anything I've heard from those three bands, and I never even heard of Jericho Road until I got this DVD, so thank you for that nifty advertisement!",3,Comedy that runs out of gags midway through,1098403200,"10 22, 2004",2004,2415,"['Overall', 'film', ""n't"", 'bad', 'starting', 'film', 'Halestorm', 'Entertainment', 'ensure', 'film', 'was', 'successful', 'newly', 'formed', 'LDS', 'film', 'industry', 'were', 'plenty', 'hilarious', 'cameos', 'LDS', 'Celebrities', 'Steve', 'Young', 'who', 'just', 'awesome', 'comedic', 'cameo', 'Julie', 'Stoffer', 'MTV', 'Real', 'World', 'New', 'Orleans', 'infamy', 'cameo', 'was', 'brilliant', 'cleverly', 'cut', 'sequence', 'Richard', 'Dutcher', 'who', 'made', 'God', 'Army', 'other', 'notables.The', 'one', 'big', 'thing', 'disliked', 'film', 'was', 'direct', 'talking', 'audience', 'main', 'character', 'device', ""'m"", 'personally', 'not', 'fond', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'much', 'better', 'playing', 'straight', 'up', 'film', 'out', 'funny', 'enough', 'jokes', 'seem', 'run', 'out', 'way', 'drags', 'conclusion', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'trimmed', 'ten', 'minutes', 'comedies', 'usually', 'should', ""n't"", 'go', 'much', '80-90', 'minutes', 'Always', 'leave', 'audience', 'wanting', 'more', 'not', 'feeling', 'jokes', 'were', 'stretched', 'thin', 'cover', 'over', 'formulaic', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'plot', '.I', 'was', 'hoping', 'see', 'more', 'scenes', 'Provo', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'nice', 'souvenir', 'two', 'years', 'there', ""'m"", 'only', 'vaguely', 'familiar', 'Singles', 'Ward', 'remember', 'little', 'games', 'people', 'played', 'asking', 'others', 'dates', 'playful', 'childish', 'way', 'indirectly', 'asking', 'someone', 'out', 'date', 'much', 'film', 'rings', 'true', 'acting', 'overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'always', 'knew', 'Utah', 'Valley', 'had', 'incredible', 'talent', 'waiting', 'be', 'tapped', ""n't"", 'bad', 'debut', 'film', 'Halestorm', 'Entertainment', 'so', 'far', ""'ve"", 'made', 'four', 'other', 'films', 'hope', 'will', 'keep', 'making', 'types', 'films', 'are', 'many', 'stories', 'telling', 'LDS', 'perspective', 'BYU', 'practically', 'gold', 'mine', 'stories', 'Hollywood', 'too', 'snobby', 'look', 'Halestorm', 'much', 'credit', 'support', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'world', 'feature', 'films', 'niche', 'market.This', 'DVD', 'cool', 'extra', 'features', 'make', 'worth', 'adding', 'one', 'personal', 'library', 'favorite', 'music', 'video', 'Jericho', 'Road', 'Mormon', 'answer', 'boy', 'band', '98', 'Degrees', 'All-4-One', 'song', 'video', 'awesome', 'can', 'definitely', 'give', 'NSYNC', 'Backstreet', 'Boys', '98', 'Degrees', 'run', 'money', 'certainly', 'better', 'song', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'three', 'bands', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'Jericho', 'Road', 'got', 'DVD', 'so', 'thank', 'nifty', 'advertisement']",N/A
